It covers 1/3 of the world's surface. Ringed by fire. Constantly reshaped by the almighty clash of Earth's tectonic plates. Creating lifeforms that, in turn, become the architects of underwater empires. Here the world's most primitive life forms have outlived dinosaurs, and found astonishing ways to adapt and survive in one of the most competitive environments on the planet. This is "The Wildest Pacific." The Pacific Ocean spans more than 155 million square kilometers. Its depths are less mapped than the surface of Mars. As we forge further into the underwater frontier, numbering species are being uncovered at a rate of nearly 2,000 each year. The Pacific Ocean's terrains are as varied as the land mirrored above. From hulking sea mounts, island atolls and lagoons, to a monumental network of barrier reef so long it can be seen from space. The complex ecosystems of reefs are the lifeblood of the Pacific. One of the most important reef areas is known as The Coral Triangle. This small western corner of the Pacific has scientists enthralled. Below the water line, a vast empire of coral reefs has flourished from Indonesia, north to the Philippines, and west to the Solomon Islands. This area packs in 3/4 of the planet's coral species and is home to the world's largest and smallest fish. Like an underwater Amazon, the coral triangle has the highest concentration of marine biodiversity on the planet. There are single reefs that contain more species than the entire Caribbean. Here major ocean currents converge, allowing species to intermingle. Millennia of stable temperature have given evolution time to do its astonishing work. The triangle is flanked by volcanic activity, sandy beaches, and the world's densest concentration of mangrove forests. This range of topography in such a small area has forced nature's hand into specialized and curious adaptations. Reefs flourish on submerged continental shelves, on remnants of collapsed volcanoes, or take hold on new sea mounts rising up to meet the surface. Over time, a reef develops zones with varying currents, temperature, and structure. Like rainforests on land, coral reefs form huge, complex ecosystems spanning hundreds of kilometers. Each habitat hothouses its own variations of life. From algae to crustaceans. The smallest fish to apex predators. Each tier of the food chain supports the one above and those at the top keep populations in check. It's an intricate dance that has surged and subsided time and time again for some 400 million years. Modern reefs have risen in the evolutionary blink of an eye as sea levels for the past 10,000 years or so have remained somewhat stable. These immense underwater empires are engineered from the tiniest of building blocks. Coral. Often thought of as a plant or rocklike mineral, its neither. A coral polyp is an animal, a tiny carnivore just millimeters wide feeding on passing zooplankton. Little more than a mouth encircled by stinging tentacles. Coral does, however, have vegetable and mineral qualities. Polyps themselves are clear. A reef's striking color comes from an even tinier organism within. Algae called zooxanthellae. Like terrestrial plants, the algae photosynthesizes, converting sunlight to energy. Hard corals build limestone exoskeletons. New polyps grow in the remnants of the forebearers, creating the structural framework of a reef city. Hundreds of millions of years ago coral cousins broke free to become swimmers. Today seen as jellyfish. An evolutionary explosion took place in the seas. Swimmers became walkers. Sea life adapted to poorly oxygenated waters with tubes and gills. The first vertebrates appeared as bony fish. Then amphibians, reptiles, and animals graduated on land. Occasionally, taking an evolutionary U-turn and returning to the sea. The reef itself is engineered, not only by the living coral, but by the animals around it. From drifting algae and plankton up to the apex hunters, is one of the most complex and delicately balanced ecosystems on Earth. This titan triggerfish is one the reef's hardest workers. It has strong, rounded teeth designed to crunch into coral walls and seabeds in search of tiny crabs and molluscs. The titan's mouth is so strong, it's able to life large lumps of coral and rock to uncover the best of the reef's hidden smorgasbord. An intelligent fish, the titan will spit water jets to uncover food. Today this trigger has an unearthed a clam. The shell is too tough to crack even for a titan. But this is one of the few tool using fish. The titan drops the clam onto the seabed in an effort to crack it open. This trigger fish hasn't quite found the right tools today. The sand here is too soft. The clam's hard casing remains unbreached. Reef builders like titans and parrotfish aren't just a part of this environment. They help shape it. With formidable teeth fused into beaks, they gnaw into the limestone coral to reach the algae within. This fish excrete the hard parts they don't digest as calcium carbonate, or sand. A single fish can create up to 90 kilograms of sand every year this way. Nearly every animal on the reef contributes in some manner. Shells, carapaces, bony skeletons, all break down into tiny mineral fragments. Their remains line beaches, form islands, line bays and burrows of new lives just beginning. The sand surrounding a reef is made up of its last tiny remnants. Over time, it builds up and births new kingdoms. Between reef and land is the inshore zone. These areas are protected from incoming waves but the shallows are exposed to harsh elements, lower oxygen levels, and UV rays. Only the hardiest of corals survive here. Dense boulder and brain corals dominate. There's enough gentle tidal flow for nutrients to pass through and protection from strong currents and waves. Inshore animals can maneuver comfortably and develop ingenious methods to do so. Boulder corals grow at a rate of just three centimeters a year. Some are estimated to be over 1,000 years old. A master of the boulder domain emerges from its coral lair to begin dawn patrol. While most octopuses prefer to hunt at night, the day octopus takes advantage of the less competitive sunlight hours. This boldness is backed with exceptional camouflage skills. The day octopus can change body color in just 3/10 of a second. A sophisticated network of pigmented chromatophore organs in its skin allows it to not only change color but its entire texture. Every second the day octopus reassess where it is and where it wants to go and dresses appropriately to hide or to hunt. This hunting technique is an all in approach. Try everything at once and see what morsels the reef gives up. Boulder corals are a haven for small fish and crabs. Staples of the octopus diet. It completely envelopes a small coral head and employs a net fishing technique. The octopus sucks sea water into the webbing between each tentacle and blasts it out, hoping the force will flush out any hidden treats. Nearly 2/3 of this octopuses neurons are located in its arms. So they can work independently from the brain. This makes it the ultimate smart mover. It can apply several hunting techniques at once. Using its arm to thoroughly explore nearby crevices at the same time it's flushing out an entire coral head. Apart from a centralized feeding beak within its head, the day octopus is boneless. Allowing it to squeeze into almost any coral cavity. Its eyes have sensory receptors to keep vision oriented on the move. Like an inbuilt stabilizer, they'll see the same view even as they flip upside down and move quickly. Which is useful when under attack by damselfish. Damselfish are perennials of the reef. There are nearly 250 species of these small, fork-tailed fish and most of those live in the Indo-Pacific. Despite their size of less than 15 centimeters, damsels are highly territorial. They won't hesitate to take on a much larger octopus. These fish are dedicated farmers. They tend a small algal patch which provides food. They also have egg laying zones within male territories. The males will guard the clutch of fertilized eggs ferociously. When intruders enter their zone, damselfish release a chemical alarm into the water. Other species join the attack on the octopus. For this day octopus, ambush hunting can become a little difficult when shadowed by an agitated amassing school. Some mornings it proves easier to abandon the hunt and go back to bed. Shoals of fish begin to thin out as the reef outskirts give way to undersea sand beds. The corridors between reefs can feel like abandoned hallways. Beyond the beach and boulder gardens, protected in sheltered bays, are expanses of sandy sea floor. Vast tracks without protective cover are a high risk area for animals to venture into. However, these seemingly deserted underwater expanses are teeming with life. In fact, the sea floor supports more species than anywhere else in the reef ecosystem. The bottom dwellers and diggers, crabs, worms, and shellfish, all looking for a life away from the hungry mouths of a crowded reef. Reef rubble rolls down and gathers at the edges of the long flats. It has just enough nooks and crannies to hold the interest of one of the Pacific's most extraordinary crustaceans. The brilliantly hued peacock mantis shrimp digs burrows in the sand at the reef's edge. From here it ventures out to hunt. Despite its size of just a hand span or two, this mantis shrimp has developed exceptional hunting apparatus. It has one of the most complex sight systems in the animal kingdom. Each eye can contain millions of light sensitive cells that pick up more wave lengths of color than mammals, 10 times more than humans. They can even see ultraviolet light. The peacock mantis shrimp's eyes are able to work independently to scan for food or zero in on a target. Folded up underneath its body are these oversized claws, modified into clubs. The clubs are covered in a thin layer of crystalline hydroxy appetite. A coating that makes the clubs much harder than the rest of the flexible exoskeleton. These hammers can snap out with more speed than a 22 caliber bullet. Enough to shatter the hard shells of marine molluscs and crabs. It's the fastest punch in the animal kingdom. While this formidable mini predator boasts one of the strongest punches on the planet, most marine floor dwellers rely on another time honored technique to survive. They hide. For some, it's simply a matter of replicating the sea floor as much as possible. Others become expert burrowers. Like gobies. They're one of the largest marine families. Estimated at more than 2,000 species and counting. Many of those, like the rare blue-barred ribbon goby, are only found in the Coral Triangle. Most gobies have developed fused pectoral fins to help cling to coral rubble and rock. These crab-eyed gobies use their modified fins to dig and fan at the soft sand. Crab eyes form monogamous pair bonds. They quickly dedicate their partnerships to round the clock housework. Their brooding burrows can tunnel more than half a meter down. If they can't hide quickly enough, the twin spots on their fins might be mistaken for the eyes of a crab in the shadows. When the time comes for the female to lay her eggs, the male will be the one to tend to them in the burrow below. The female may even seal up the entrance with the male inside. Until then, the sand is soft and the tunnel keeps collapsing. Home maintenance is constant. The jawfish is a close relative of the goby and is equally small at just 12 centimeters long. It's evolved earth moving equipment of its own. Incredibly strong mandibles to scoop out its den. Jawfish have learned they can stabilize the soft entrance by lining it with shell and rock which means less upkeep. And to shut out unwelcome night visitors, they'll seal the entrance for a restful sleep. Eels are the dedicated homebodies of the suburban reef flats. Fields of spotted garden eels can be found along Indo-Pacific floors. They'll burrow into the seabed as soon as they're big enough to make decent headway or tailway, as they descend tail first. When they're wiggled their body length well below the surface, garden eels secrete a mucus which acts as a cement to harden the walls of the tube they'll live in for the rest of their lives. They'll even spawn within these burrows, only extending on mass into the current to feed on passing zooplankton. Blue ribbon eels also rarely leave their holes in their 20 year lifespan. They don't congregate in large groups but often pair up. These ribbon eels have developed large flared nostrils to act as nets to catch passing tidbits and to detect any changes in current that may forecast the approach of predators. In this case, a notorious larger cousin. The yellow-edged moray eel can grow nearly two and a half meters in length. It has a formidable set of teeth to snatch crustaceans, fish, and other eels in its nightly hunt. Rather than burying itself in the floor, it prefers a premade home a little higher up in a coral bommie. Bommies are columns of emerging reef. Satellite suburbs away from the dense bustle of the busy marine metropolis. It's usually a small patch reef in a lagoon growing towards sunlight in a column. As the coral colonizes and grows into a spire, territorial animals like morays will claim the home and defend it from others of their own kind. These patches also become important geographical markers for ocean migrators and pillars of industry where marine business deals are exchanged. The elongated body of the yellow-edged moray eel is perfectly designed to wind its way into protective nooks and crevices. Here it sits with its body tucked inside and the large toothed head poking out, ready to strike at passing prey or interlopers. This moray doesn't have the protection of scales. Rather, it secretes a thick mucus coat through its skin. To keep parasites at bay and dead cells from building up, it engages the services of a professional cleaner. These coral bommies often double up as a one stop marine cleaning station. It's a competitive marketplace. A number of species all vie for a customer's attention. Several coral triangle shrimp species are cleaners. They rock and wave, frantically advertising their availability. Most cleaner shrimp are thought to only see in gray scale. Fish will stop and open their mouths or fan their fins to indicate they're ready to clean. Some will even darken or lighten in color, which the colorblind shrimp can take as their cue to board. With shellfish high on the menu for a moray, this eel seems to have a feast at its doorstep. But it recognizes the cleaners and grants a Pacific cleaner shrimp permission to board. It's a delicate dance to judge the right time for a deep clean. The prized parasites live inside of the moray eel's sizable mouth. The benefit of a parasite clean out far outweighs the nutritional profit of a single shrimp. But a mistimed step can irritate the moray. It has an extra long holding tooth on the roof of its mouth. A sudden snap could be fatal. Success. The Pacific shrimp has got the job done. Scavenger hinge-beaked shrimp wait eagerly for scraps below. Nearby, a bluestreak cleaner wrasse hovers. It's also advertising its services. The wrasse's ability to swim freely allows it to tend to a wider range of clientele. Cleaner station bommies effectively act as a marine Switzerland. A neutral ground where the usual predator prey interactions are paused and a ceasefire is declared for the benefit of all. A fish will signal readiness to be groomed by slowing and moving into vertical position. It then spreads its fins and gills. The tiny wrasse works fast and efficiently. They whip around the mouth and even enter the gill openings to devour thousands of parasites. Their diligence is extraordinary, completing up to 2,000 cleaning sessions daily. Bluestreaks lump their fish clients into three categories. Dangerous predators, which, unsurprisingly, get top tier service. They'll be tended to first. Next are the floater fish. These are astute clients that roam from bommie to bommie in search of the most efficient service. In a competitive market, wrasse will often squabble over rights to a customer. And finally, the coral bommie's residents. These fish are often forced to wait their turn, even if they arrive in line first. The resident fish are often subjected to a subpar service. The bite and dash. With skin and protective mucus, offering a more nutritious meal than ectoparasites alone, a bluestreak has to make a tactical decision. Will it nip off a little more than it should? Bluestreak wrasse have very good memories. They can keep track of more than 100 individual clients and can recall if their last interaction was positive. If the cleaner is aware it mistreated a valued customer last time, it's more likely to follow up with a pleasant clean and possibly even a fin massage. The grand buffet of all clients is one that travels far and wide and has a large surface area in need of constant grooming. This bommie sits in a strong current of Milne Bay in Papua New Guinea. These underwater highways between bommies are dense in plankton. Easy pickings for filter feeding manta rays. Where the plankton is heavily concentrated, manta rays begin barrel rolling. These tight loops keep them in the feeding zone, working the water columns while the nutrients are thick. Some of these reef migrators have traveled several hundred kilometers in search of new nutrient rich currents. They may stop over for a day or stay in the area for months. The manta train rolling into the station is always cause for a flurry of excitement. All cleaner species will compete to tend to one of these oceanic giants. In fact, some species that aren't usually cleaners will even temporarily take on the role just for manta rays. Small, vividly hued moon wrasse are highly territorial, harassing anything that ventures into their home range. Moon wrasse are not ordinarily cleaner fish. However, their behavior changes in the presence of a manta. Seemingly smitten, moon wrasse suddenly join the queue of species vying for cleaning right. They'll even follow the mantas for long distances, drawing them far from the home reaches they fought so hard to protect. Researchers are yet to identify why manta rays have this hypnotic effect on the moon wrasse. When the mantas leave the bommie, they'll venture far beyond the protection of the reef in search of new feeding grounds. The outgoing passage from the reef's safety to open ocean crosses the outer reef drop off. The drop off faces seaward and slopes to the ocean floor. Depending on the age and height of the reef, the descent may be just a few meters or a plunge down to 50. This is where waves, traveling hundreds of kilometers, finally meet resistance. It's a place for the hardiest of corals, plates and brain corals. Those strong enough to withstand the constant buffeting. The agitated surface water stirs up algae and plankton, sparking a web of feeding. Fish schools of all size and shape patrol the drop off and the big predators know that. Here the cues to mate, feed, and hide all come from the tide and the skies above. Anthias are the jewels of the reef edge. They're small, brightly colored, and school in large numbers for protection from seaward predators. Anthias feed on the reef edges. But on this particular dusk, they have another agenda. Within these super schools are hundreds of harems, a large male surrounded by several females. The males are larger and brighter. For several minutes around sunset the amphias carefully time their rush into the water column to release eggs and sperm. Midnight snapper lurk meters below. They patrol the seaward facing reef for the tiny larval stages of animals that make up drifting plankton. For the amphias, tonight's date has been chosen to coincide with the conditions and currents most likely to carry the genetic material as far away in the open ocean as possible, away from hungry mouths. How these fish all know the precise time and place to meet is undetermined. They are here in the thousands. Across the reef, others begin their own courtship dance. A porcupine puffer fish male will spend days wooing a potential mate. The courting window for mandarin fish is within 20 minutes of sunset. Males stake out a reef ledge to transform into a stage to put on a display of their vigor. This female has come to watch the show. Like a peacock on parade, the mandarin male struts back and forth, raising his dorsal fin and flashing his colors. The more dazzling he is, the more likely she is to fall for his charms. The female is impressed. Together they align belly to belly and rise about a meter above the reef. They synchronize the release of delicate spawn clouds and, in an instant, the dance is over. Inshore of the reef, the day octopus ventures out one last time before nightfall. Notoriously solitary, they barely even tolerate their own kind. For this male, an encounter with another male leads to a quick arm wrestle for the right of way. When it does seek out company, it's to mate. The male stands tall and raises 3D skin spikes, called papillae. His approached display catches the eye of a female at the end of a day's hunt. But the females are known to rebuff unwelcome advances and, on occasion, eat their suitor. A confident male will pounce and mount. This octopus is cautious. He employs a mating strategy that keeps him at arm's length. One of the male's tentacles stores spermatophores, small packets only centimeters long that he must reach up and place into the oviduct. It sounds like a simple mission but the female's oviduct is within the same area as her other vital organs. The head. With any luck, she's had a successful day of hunting. She accepts. The more spermatophores he can place inside, the likelier his lineage continues. Flush with confidence, the male attempts a second pairing at closer range. This time he is less welcomed. She attacks. Her grasp loosens just enough for the male to make his escape. As the sun drops, the reef's day residents begin to take refuge. Darkness will bring the night hunters. Boxer crabs arm themselves. No bigger than a bottle cap, these crabs attach stinging sea anemones to their pinchers. They wield the tiny stinging animals like weapons, waving off potential predators. The anemone could deliver a nasty zap for anything that ventures too close. These boxer crabs will even steal anemones from each other during the night if they can. Feather stars take flight. These are 200 million year old animals that look like plants. Long ago, many species evolved to swim or crawl to evade predators. They anchor for the evening in plankton rich currents. Beyond the reef, one of the greatest mass migrations in the animal kingdom is taking place. Billions of tiny marine creatures begin a nightly ascent of several hundred meters to feed on plankton closer to the surface. Schools of large fish amass at the reef edge looking for a final meal. Others are looking for their first. Whitetip sharks are the reef's apex predator. They are night hunters. A smaller shark, rarely more than a couple of meters long. Reef sharks have learned to hunt in a pack. The trevally's defense is also a number's game. They confuse the sharks with large schools, swimming together with others of a similar size. The whitetips are visual hunters. The twisting and turning mass makes it difficult to pinpoint an individual target. On the reef, standing out is like ringing a dinner bell. Night hunts begin right across all of the Pacific's reefs. From the corners of The Coral Triangle, to the west coast of the Americas, an army of predators is on the march. Even the tiniest of mouths are hungry. A coral polyps animal nature awakens. It catches and consumes a baby squid. The sea is thick with larvae and plankton and a feeding frenzy builds along the food chain. A parrotfish spins a mucus cocoon to ward off night crawling parasites. But tonight, it's under attack from something else. Something much larger. A reef shark pack is on the move. They're armed with electro receptors to detect the faintest electrical signal. Even the elevated heartbeat of a fish in fear. These whitetips detect the odor of a distressed fish in the water. Food is close and the pack's feeding instincts reach a frenzied pitch. Incredibly, they still maintain a form of pecking order amongst themselves. Some pack members move to block off escape routes. Their bodies are live enough to squeeze into crevices. Sometimes it's not quite enough to stop the occasion misdirected bite. Together, they work as a hungry hoard, systematically flushing out hiding places. It's a close escape for this fish but the reef has many more in hiding and this pack will hunt until dawn. Across thousands of reefs, decisions are being made in every second of darkness. Fight or flee. The wolfer life is played out nightly. For every life sustained, another is lost. The digested carbon calcium fragments of skeleton and shell are the only remnants, born again, somewhere as sand. A minuscule contributor to a new Pacific Ocean reef.
