You're going to have a smile on your face. As long as there's a line, tickets will be half price. It's showtime. Put your money down. There's the type of man who's not interested in normal sexual activity. You know who you are, and you can stay outside while the rest of you come on in. Hey, good looking, don't you want to play? Hey, nobody -- nobody's playing the game? Hey, all right. Hey... Hey, lucky, you come in here. I can tell you're lucky tonight. [ People screaming ] Good. Thank you. See you later.

Looking for a ballplayer. Here, take a free one. Patchy, patchy, don't let him quit. Get ol' ugly over there, huh? That's right. You got it. Oh, no, you can't get out of here, ugly, not without a price on your head. Hey, no dough, no throw. No dough, no throw. Yeah, come on, come on. Come on, ugly. What are you going to do? You know what you ought to do? [ Bell clangs ] Boo! You didn't knock me in. I just got so itchy, I jumped in. I'm high and I'm dry and I ain't seen me a ballplayer all night. [ Cackles ] [ Bell dings ] Man: Doubles again. The boy has me trapped. Any state but Rhode Island and I'm history, do you hear me? Oregon -- you got it, mister. There you go. What's your name? What are you reaching under the counter for? I don't need your aggravation. I don't need your cheating. Why don't you spin for real this time? Spin? You got it. Come on. Hey, man, you should have listened to me, huh? Hey, where's that little girlfriend of yours, huh? He tried to sucker me. I wouldn't let him. Got you a dog. That's all you're going to say? I won you a dog. What do you want to do now? How about this over here? I'm bozo. I'm the mighty bozo, and I'm high and I'm dry. Whoa! Mama's little precious. Oh! Mama's little baby. Oh! Throw one in here, son. Try to put me down. What's this over here? Mama's little baby. Ha ha ha ha ha! Quick, step on it before it multiplies. We used to say that, remember? Oh, looking for a ballplayer. I ain't found me a ballplayer yet. Oh, here we go. I found me a chicken brain out there. He's got a big "g" on his coat. What's that "g" stand for, gruesome? Oh, check the baby face on the teen queen. And he's got the brains to match. Hey, what's that goofy-looking thing on your neck? Why don't you step out here and say that, buddy? I don't hang out with losers, goofy. I'm here and I'm high and I'm dry. Come on, goofy. Don't let your mind wander. It's too weak to be let out alone. Ha ha ha! I ain't found me a ballplayer yet. Oh, you got pretty good reflexes. Say, sweetheart, how's it feel waking up with a jerk? [ Cackles ] You feel like doing some needlepoint? Whoa! I'm high, and I'm a dry bozo. What are you smiling at? You're living proof of reincarnation. No one could be as dumb as you in one lifetime. Hey, musclehead, you know why she's shorter than you? It's because she shrinks from your touch. Ow! That's it. There he comes. High and outside. I think you need a relief pitcher. Whoo! Looking for a ball-- oh! [ Cackles ] This guy's so dull his dog left him. Play again. Whoa. Hey, hey, hey! Ha ha. Put one in my mouth. Come on, put one in my mouth. The target's over here, dummy. [ Cackles ] Okay, that's enough. Give somebody else a shot. Sweetheart, would you knock me in and take me home? Whoo! You -- [ cackles ] Come on. Let's get out of here. I been up here all night, and I ain't found a ballplayer yet. I'm starting to get dry, and I haven't been high. So come on and knock me in the water, please. [ Bell dings ] [ Cackles ] Hey, on-your-Mark. On-your-Mark, close up the joint. Oh, it was a good night. How'd we do? We did better than 300 bong tonight. I thought we were hot. Hey, hold it. Midway's over there. Don't need none of that shit. [ Coughs ] You okay? [ Coughs ] Cough sounds good. Oh, I'm freezing. Come on, open the door. All she wears for a costume is three bananas. Sugaree here is a banana dancer. How about a banana split? Take Mickey back there, darling, and get him ready. He's going to be in the show. Seats are free. Buy your tickets right over here. See the fabulous Wayne la crosse. In the course of her number, she wears three gardenias. That's it, boys. Plenty of seats for everybody. Plenty of seats. Okay, let's go. Name's on-your-Mark. If that means anything, I'll change it. What do you want? I don't know, either. Make up your mind. Um, hamburger. Want a watch with that? Costs 40 bucks. Keeps Navy time. Whoa. Ha ha. That's okay. I know him. He's harmless. Dad, don't be scaring all the girls away. Why don't you shoot US two cokes with no ice? He didn't mean to scare you. It's just his way of greeting people. Don't feel left out. That ain't no place for you. What do you mean? I mean the kook show where your boyfriend is, banana split man. Look at me for a minute. Look at me in the eye. Don't be darting your eyes around. Hold them still. Hold them still. Right in my eye. Let's see, let's see. You are 18. You'll be 19 in December. Am I lying? What are you, Mr. Crystal ball around here? I must have missed your act. If I had all night, I'd be an astronaut. You're not an astronaut, and how much is it? A buck, thank you. Here's 2. Thanks. Thank you. Why don't you eat your burger before it gets too cold? And quit looking over there. What's your name? You tell me. Okay, tell me the first letter. D. D. A, b, c, d. Okay, how many letters? That's cheating. You're getting this for nothing. Don't you want to learn something? Oh, okay. Five. Five letters. Starts with a "d," it's got five letters. D-a, d-n, d-a-n, d-i-s, d-o. Uh...donna. Your name's Donna. Ha ha ha. Am I lying? Is your name Donna? I think I better go. I got it. Oh, hey, don't worry about that. Why don't you try to guess my age? I guessed your age. Look in my eyes. Come on, look right in my pupil. First number in your mind is the one. 25? 25? Ha ha ha. She got it right off the bat. I'm 25. You do it naturally. What the hell's going on? We're just guessing ages and names, huh? Can't I leave you alone for five minutes? Is this guy hassling you? Nobody's hassling anybody. Let's just go. You work here, buddy? Get him a seltzer. He lost his bankroll. Don't mess with me, man. You mess with my lady, you better be ready to mess with me, buddy. Get up! Don't fuck with me. We got US a big iron and steel man -- she's going to iron, and he's going to steal. What happened to your belt buckle, goofy? Ha ha ha ha! Fucking freak. I think it's past your bedtime. Don't you know where the exit is? Shit, yes. Well, use it. You're lucky I didn't bring mine, asshole. Screw. Thanks a lot, Donna. As usual, you've got to sniff up some guy's leg. Why don't you just bite it, Mickey? Donna! Hey, look, I'm sorry about what I said, okay? I lost my head. That's okay. You won't miss it. Patch: You keep this up, I'm going to have to build you a bigger cage. Frankie: That's not a bad idea anyway. Whoops. Feel like doing something here? Excuse me. Where are you girls from? Redding. Feel like winning something tonight? Okay. [ Coughing ] You want to try a little of this? No, no. Woman: Hurry up. We're going to be late. You know, you think you're so smart. You ought to try getting in the cage. Your ass is parading up and down the midway getting kickback, dry as a bone. Do you know how much money we had to pay off so we could stay open this week? I don't give a shit about how much it costs. I'm talking about getting in the cage. Woman: Hey, Frankie, got an aspirin? No, but I could make you a cottage cheese and mustard sandwich. Ha ha ha. It works for me. Come here. Morning, Frankie. Sure was swell. Give me a kiss. Oh, mmm, mmm, mmm. You been stealing my balloons? Is that what you think? Ha ha ha ha. Okay, see you next season. See you around, bozo. Thanks for the ride. Watch your step. Yeah, I'll tell you, I like to see them come and I like to see them go, you know what I mean? Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Oh. Ought to get me a hat like this. What do you think? Then let me ask you something. I mean, just US, you and me here. Take a look at my hairline. Is it, uh, going -- receding back? Huh? Have you noticed it moving back? Oh, shit. You know, I'm getting too old for this stuff, I think. Dogs in the hedge. Yeah. Is that that chick out there that I guessed her name last night? Is that her? Look. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know the one you mean. Hey, you got a ballplayer looking for a bozo here. Boy, she looks good. Mm-hmm. You think I ought to go hustle her down? Well, you ought to wipe the mustard off your mouth if you're going to go hustle anybody down. How's that? Let me see. Probably amazing. Well, I feel like I fell off a ride, but here I go. I'll catch you later. All right. Man: Ixnay meezarg. Hiya, bozo. Ha ha ha ha. Now, what do you want with the bozo? First your money-o, then your clothes-o, and then anything goes-o. [ Laughing ] What the hell are you gawking at? Go ahead and pet him. What are you waiting for? Easy there, carny. Oh, easy, carny. Easy. Go ahead. Go and pet him. Go ahead. [ Gasps ] How are you doing, dad? Not so good, Frankie. I've been with it too long. Start taking it a little more easy. You take it easy. I don't know how. Whoa. We go. Let's go over here. Is he crazy? It's questionable, but he can still jump into any one of these joints along here and make more money than anyb-- are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. Don't let those guys scare you because they're just having fun, that's all. How'd you know the month I was born in? What? The month I was born in. It was your, uh, birthstone in your engagement ring. Oh, yeah, but Donna's not the only 5-letter name that starts with "d." I know it. There's about 12 of them. I'm busy right now memorizing all those things. What's that? This is Harold's trailer here. Wake up in there! He's the fat boy. He never gets out of there. How come? If he fell down, he'd never get up. That's terrible. No, fat people come in there by the millions, and then he makes them feel skinny. Come back here, you son of a bitch! Get out of there, you motherfucker! Hey, what's going on? What the -- stand back! Take it easy. Whoa, take it easy. Except she shaves her chest hair. You're kidding. Patch: Hey, what's the matter with you? [ Truck horn honking ] Easy, easy, easy, easy. Easy, easy, easy, easy. What are you, a sore loser, huh? What's the story? What's going on? Jerry, get this son of a bitch off me. Cut it out! What's with the mayor? It's the heat. One phone call and close this down! Wait a minute. Hold it! All I want is my money. You've got a lot of hustling going on out on that midway, fella. So you either make good on the deal, or I'll make that phone call. Let's straighten this out. How much did you lose? $200. [ Yells ] Shut your trap. I didn't take him. He blew it, man. You shut your clam. Shut your clam. Okay, here, here. Don't go back out there and lose this money. All right? Okay, come on. Jerry? Jerry, look. It's Jerry, right? Listen, I'm sorry about this whole thing. We're trying to run a clean show here. It's bad for business for US, too, you know? You're a churchgoing man, right? Got a youth organization down there with a bunch of kids? Let's bring them all down here, let them go on the rides for nothing, okay? Here's a bunch of passes, all right? Okay? All on behalf of the great American carnival, okay? Thank you, thank you. All right? Jerry: I can't let you out of my sight. What are you doing? Are you trying to make my job tough? I was just trying to make a buck. Just trying to make a piece like everybody else. Just trying to make a buck. And you owe me. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Come on. Just a little something to get your blood going. Come here. I want to show you something. I don't believe it. Is that what you call cross-fire? Yeah, it's still cross-fire. It happens everywhere we go. Everywhere? Everywhere. Wherever you go, trouble follows. I don't know. I kind of like it myself. How long have you been a clown? A clown? Yeah. I look like a clown to you? Well, there's no clowns around here. Clowns are funny. I'm scary. I go out there -- this is a mask, a simple mask. I go lock myself in a goddamn cage and drive people mad, and you never know when one of them is going to run around and try to make hamburger meat out of you. I've had firecrackers thrown at me. They've hit and went off on me, and it didn't even bother me. I never realized it was that dangerous. Well, shit, that's why I do it. But you learn how to read people. That's the best part about it. I don't give a shit about the money, but you learn how to read people. What do you do? I'm a waitress. Well, I bet you get a lot of tips. Can't you tell who's going to tip big and who's going to give you, you know, a hard time? It's not the same thing. Yeah, it's not. I know what you mean. It ain't the same thing. I hate it. I hate this whole town. I don't know. Well, are you going to, uh, marry gruesome? Ha ha. Gruesome? Yeah, your, uh, boyfriend there. No, gruesome -- I'm saving him for my mother. They deserve each other. Saving gruesome for your mother? Yes. God, I'll tell you, if I had the money for a bus ticket, I'd leave right now. Well, it sounds to me like you ought to be traveling with US 'cause that's all we do. Does that stuff come off in water? You just missed a spot there. You sure that comes off? It comes off a little bit, but if you really want to get it off good, you have to use a person. A person? Mm-hmm. Mmm. Mmm. Ha ha ha. Ooh. Mmm, taste like a clown to me. I think I could get to like this. Ha ha. Look at yourself in the mirror here. Hey, I look as pretty as you. Man: You look like you're sleeping standing up. What, did throw him down there with the giant? You and the giant riding together? Yeah? Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Donna. Look at you. You look great. It's good to see you again. I want you to meet my partner patch bogry. He looks kind of dark and ominous, but he's not. This is great. Look at you. This is a friend of mine -- Donna. This is patch bogry, my partner, and she's going to go to Raleigh with US. What? She's going to Raleigh with US. Does anybody know where you are? No. You know, we're crossing some state lines here. How old is Donna? Donna's 18. She'll be 19 in December. Am I lying? Right. Right. Let's hit it. Let's hit it. Let's go! Raleigh's waiting! Right this way. Get in the back here. Put a 14 here. You'll go here, huh? Hey, what's with Frankie? He's in heat over this jailbait. I ain't running a home for runaways, you know. Put a 12 here. We'll put the wheel joint here. Wait a minute, heavy, don't do that. Don't put me next to the bozo again. The cat clogs up the midway. Give me one of those eye-openers you promised me. Come on, come on, give me one. I know you're holding. Come on, come on. All right, all right. Don't worry about it. You're going to feel much better. Heavy: So, I tell you, huh? I checked it out already. She's over 18. Don't worry about it. 12. 12 here. Nails. All right. Charlie, come on, man. Okay. Put a 12 here, Greta. All right. How long's she going to stay? What? Did you ever try and live with the bozo? Come on, come on, Roscoe. Somebody's talking to you. Ha ha ha! Bozo's here. I'm mighty high and I'm mighty dry. Hey, patch, it's raining. You should have been a weatherman. I know it's raining. Close it. Close it, huh? Ha ha ha! Whoo! Schmuck. Well, I was up here all night. I never did find me a ballplayer. Ha ha ha! What are you going to do? [ Bell dings ] [ Siren wails ] That was a lucky shot, you son of a bitch. Ha ha ha! Son of a bitch. We don't need this, damn it. Come on. My goodness. Here's some hot coffee for you, and supper should be ready pretty soon. Did you do this for US? Well, how nice. I'm dripping all over your floor. What do you think about this, patch? I'm going to change. I had some papers over here -- an envelope. Did you see it? It put it away. It's over there in the drawer. Don't tidy up my stuff, okay? Well, it was dirty in here. That's all right. I like to write in the dust. What's that smell? What's that cooking smell? You ought to have some proper food. He's going to catch a cold in that tank. Frankie doesn't catch cold. Have some coffee. Hey, what do you think of her? What is this, girlfriend time? Is this your girlfriend out here? It's not my girlfriend. It's our girlfriend. It doesn't look like our girlfriend to me. It looks like your girlfriend. She's just trying to be nice. Why don't you give me a chance to work this out? Donna: Frankie? Just give me a minute. Come here. There's something going on out here. It's probably your dinner's getting cold. What is it, dear? Look. See? Oh. [ Shouting and cheering ] Come on, let me show you something. Get your coat. Come on. Hey, great, great, great. Yahoo! Ha ha ha. I don't get it. Who's getting married? The two on the merry-go-round. Just one ride, and it's, uh, good for a season, you know. Ah, petey, give me a kiss for luck. Where are you going, bud? I got business with heavy. There's a jamboree going on. I know, I know. I'll meet you over there later. Okay. Let's go. Let's hear it for Harold! Hit it, Texas weavers! [ Applause ] [ Playing rock 'n' roll ] It's all yours, Harold! * wah-waah * wah-wah * wah-waah * wah-wah * wah-waah, wah-wah * wah-waah, wah-waah, wah-wah * * well, they call me, they call me the fat man * * 'cause I weigh 600 pounds woman: Is that all? * and when I shake my belly * the little girls all come around * * yeah, they call me, they call me the fat man * * and I go from town to town * * what I like to do * is throw my weight around * well, they call me, they call me the fat man * * and my real name is Mr. 5x5 * * takes a train to love me * four girls to hold my side * * wah-waah * wah * a-wah-waah * wah * wah-waah, wah-waah, wah-waah, wah-waah * * wah-wah [ applause ] Nice going, Harold. Nice going. That's the law in this state -- no exhibition of human oddities for profit. What if we made it $1,200? Sorry. Listen, I'm getting heat, too. I just can't let you stay open. Heavy: It's iced. Can I talk to you for a minute, please? Let me tell you something about Mr. St. John. He's been in this business a long time, and frankly, he's getting sick and tired of being squeezed. The man can't be pushed no more, and he has a very simple solution for the whole thing. All he's got to do is next season come here, stick up a bunch of rides -- no girlie show, no freaks in the sideshow, no games of chance, no bozo joint -- and you guys don't even have to come around. You know what I mean? No show, no dough. Come on. All right? Well, all right, but if I see any freaks working, I'm going to shut this whole damn place down. They got something against freaks. It's the best I could do. Shit. The problem is all those clever god-fearing decent people who know what's good for US. They're so clever, they know what's good for everybody. I don't care what you think, w.C. You're special people. Don't let this petty shit get you down. All I want to do is my act. We have been in show business since we were this high. I know, percilla. Carnival ain't even a real carnival without a sideshow, don't you know that? If there's problems after this spot, I'm going into real estate. It's a scam. They think the freaks don't have to earn a living. They don't think they have feelings, huh? They'd rather see them in the welfare line. What are you going to tell w.C.? I got to tell him something. I got to carry him. And this rain, we need this shit on top of everything else. Harry: Hey, patch. Let me see what Harry wants. I'll see you over at the joint. All right, all right. What's doing? I want to introduce you to a couple of twins. This is Billie and Bobbie. What -- wait a minute. Wait a minute now. Are you interested in her? Sure, you're interested. Billie and Bobbie -- are they too old for you? No, they're just a little weird. They finish each other's sentences. Why don't I take them over to the jamboree? We're rained out, so they're having a party over there. Go ahead. I'll catch you a little later. I'll take the girls over there. We'll meet you. Come on, everybody. Come on, fellas, here we go. Everybody dance. Let's go. Come on. I'm harmless. I'm harmless. Come on, now, get up off of those feet. [ Playing funk ] Heavy: Oh, look at her. Have I got one for you. What's that? Take a look over your right shoulder. God damn, where did you find them? They were over at the hat's joint -- hanging out at Harry's joint. Come on, you got to meet them. Come on. This is my friend Frankie. This is Billie and Bobbie. I'm Billie. I'm Bobbie. Who's what now? I'm Billie. They look like bookends. What did I tell you? Y'all are sin twisters, aren't you? Together: You got it. We got to put something together here. I need to have a little talk with you. Would you excuse US? What's the matter? Nice to meet you. We'll be right back. I got Donna here. Donna's here. What am I going to do with her? I can't send her to a movie. We can't let something like this get away. You know how long you've been talking about having some double duty like this? Now's your chance. I know, but I don't want to get double-doored in the double duty. You got to help me out with this situation. This is going to be a gift from me to you 'cause I just can't leave her out there. That's all. You understand. Okay? Yeah, sure. Yeah. We going to party? Listen up, you kids. There's something I know. Let it rain, let it pour. We're going to win it all back in Charlotte and more. And you watch me down south. I'll get myself a tin bucket and a rubber duck, and I'll make more than all of you. I'm going out a winner! [ Applause ] I've been with it 50 years, and it's time I packed it in. I'm going to get myself a little place down in gibtown, and I hope you'll come visit me in carny land. I'm going to miss each and every one of you. Now with that settled, what do you say we get shitfaced? The wages of sin -- to higher wages! Hit it! [ Playing blues ] [ Thunder rumbling ] [ Laughter ] Man: Here, I got some stuff. And they're like nobody else. Who are you talking about now? Carnies. Ciz-arnies. Ciz-arnies. Very good. Hey. Yeah. Well, how about a big kiz-iss? Sure. Siz-ure. Ha ha ha ha. [ Frankie and Donna laughing ] How do you say that? Shi-zure. She-iz-ure. Shiz-your. Ha ha ha ha. Shiz-ure. Shiz-ure. Ha ha ha. Gosh, teenagers. What are you going to do with the teenagers of america? There's a few things. Ha ha ha ha. Mmm, gosh. * born to lose * I've lived my life in vain * hi. Y'all come on in. You boys public or drivers? We're drivers. Well, good. Just go and sit down. Patch: Let's just get something to go. Hey, watch out for my food, dude. Man: If these old boys are drivers, they're lost. Who did you boys say you was pulling for? International pacific express out of Dallas, Texas. We need three burgers to go... That's shit, man. Three cokes right now with no ice and a whole bunch of mayonnaise. Hey, Denny, I bet these people couldn't tell diesel from dog shit. That's what I was thinking. Who are you with, mama? I ain't with you. How about me, mama? Man: You like candy, little girl? Looks pretty good, doesn't she? Are you people in show business? We're carnies. We're with the carnival. My old man was a carny. He wasn't worth shit. Well, it's obvious your mother made two mistakes, huh? You better have these boys pay upfront. How about this, whistle dick? Money walks, bullshit talks. Watch your mouth. Why don't you go paint your face, lady? You're feeling pretty hot today, aren't you? * born to lose * I've lived my life in vain * you don't belong here, pal. Hey, pencil neck. We're just getting something to go. We'll be out of here in a minute. Make it 10 seconds. There's no problem. Hey, we don't want no trouble, okay? Why don't you go back and eat your chili, Geronimo? We don't need this kind of -- [ shouting ] Come on, Geronimo, come on! Shit. Get up. Come on. Hurry up, you guys. So long, asshole! Ride in the trailer. Let me cool him out. Come on. Come on. Christ. Whoo! Ha ha ha! We could have taken them. We could have got them. We had them in the palm of our hand. That's what it's like in the cage. I'll tell you that. Are you finished with her yet? What do you mean? Are you finished with her yet? Well, uh... I mean, first her goddamn boyfriend, then these animals. Next it's going to be her father next it's going to be her father with the police bringing heat all over US. With the police bringing heat all over US. What is this shit, man? That's not going to happen. Heavy's all over my goddamn case. Well, what for? She loves the carnival. She's just got to get to know it, that's all. This is none of her business. She had her peek at the inside. We don't need this shit, man. She ain't even got a father. Look, you just tell her, okay? Let's just get her out of here by the time we open, that's all. Right? I'll talk to her. He wants me out, right? Right? Donna, I've told you over and over it doesn't have anything to do with you personally. Damn it. It's the way we've been doing things for a long time. For 10 years, we've been doing this bozo thing. I can't explain it any more than that. I could get a job. Doing what? Dancing. Dancing? With sugaree and pagan and flame. They said I could already. I think it would be a kick. Sweetheart, I just don't think you can handle it. Donna -- hey, look, I didn't leave some hick town just to be dropped off in the middle of nowhere. Why should I leave, just because he says so? Listen, he may tell you when to shit, but no one tells me. What are you trying to do, get rid of me? Don't you care what happens to me? I care about you. Frankie? Shit. Yeah, I care about you, too. I just get mixed up sometimes, that's all. [ Knock on door ] Push it, honey. Hello, hello, hello. Where's delno? He's over at the strip tent. I'm going to go get him. Why don't you sit down? Would you please make her feel at home? She wants to work. Uh, pay that no mind. So tell me, what made you decide? I don't know. I thought I might enjoy it. Bullshit. You got dollar signs running down your spine. I got to try and get patch off my back. I think he thinks I'm just some runaway kid. Well, well, let's just see what sugaree can do. Mmm. [ Giggles ] Try this on for size. Come on, Frankie, not again. I've had enough of this. Delno, would you just wait till you see her? Come on. Watch your step. Whoa. Look at you. You look wonderful. What did I tell you? What did I tell you, delno? You work before? She worked topless. Turn around. Let me take a look at you. Side girl, no heavy stuff. You just dance behind the strippers. I bet he pays her 90 bucks a week. 90 bucks a week, take it or leave it. Oh, I'll take it. Thank you, Mr. Baptiste. Don't thank me. Don't ever thank me. So now what do you say, huh? Ha ha ha. This is going to be wonderful. I'm going to get my hips out there. Yeah. How about some people going like this? Applause. Better than you. No. Never. There's patch. I want to go get him and bring him. Would you get me some coffee -- black, no sugar, no milk? What will you have, honey? Uh, two coffees, black. Two black coffees, please. Are you busy? Yeah. Why? Come on. I want to show you some good news. I could use some good news. We got a new dancer. I want you to meet her. It was her idea. I couldn't do nothing. Delno jumped on it like fried chicken, so act surprised, okay? So you're going to be a hoochie-coochie dancer now, huh? That's right. I'm going to be making lots of money, lots. Ha ha. You ever done anything like that before? Well, she's not going to be naked. She's going to be a side girl behind the dancers. She's got a dance hall rig on. Now what do you say, huh? Good, real good. Yeah, set them over here. One for the new girl. Don't worry about that. Don't worry about it. Uhh! I got to shake my hips. Don't hustle me. I don't want to talk about it anymore. I got enough to handle. Delno, this is strictly business. Now you know Charlotte has always been a hot town, good money town. Anything goes, right? That's right. Let her play strong like the other girls. She doesn't even know what she's getting herself into. Of course she does. It's her idea. It's out of the question. She's too young. She's what? She's so young. That's a good point. What do you get out of this? [ Burlesque music playing ] [ Cheering and applauding ] Man: Watch that. Yeah! Beat it, you punks. That's it, boys. Take a good look. Watch it. They're frightening. Delno: Okay, let's hear it for pagan knight. Man: More! More! Okay, this next one is going to really singe your eyebrows. You're going to talk about this girl the rest of your life. For the young at heart, Madonna... Baby Madonna. [ Burlesque music playing ] [ Cheering and applauding ] Come on, get out here! Come on, honey, don't just stand there. What is this? Come on, for Christ's sake! Come on! Let's move! Honey, hell, I'll do it. Delno: Get off the stage, you freak! God damn it! Somebody just hit me here! Man #2: Hey, crew! Aah! Hey, crew! [ Alarm wailing ] Patch: Show's over. Hey, crew! Aah! Aah! Patch: All right, let's clear the joint. You, too. Aah! Get off me! Aah! Get out of here! Sugaree: She needs a doctor. Heavy: What is this, amateur night? She said she worked before? Is that so? What did you hold back for? Delno: Patch said she could handle it. Woman: Well, sugar, why didn't you say something? I thought I could work strong. I thought I could do it. I guess I couldn't. What's going on? What's going on? Come on, let's go to the trailer. What is this, a gaffe? I didn't want her here! Let's slaughter the fucking place! Slaughter! What happened in there? What caused this, huh? What happened? What were you doing, Donna? Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. You going to be all right, kid? Let me go get this band-aid shit here. Oh, damn it. Hey, listen, you didn't have to do that. You don't have to cover up for me. I can clean up my own mess. Don't worry. I wasn't doing it for you. Well, what are you doing? How do you think he'd feel if he knew? Well, what makes you think he doesn't know? You son of a bitch. Here. I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen. Hell, that's my fault. No, it's my fault. I froze. Listen, she can't be dancing that damn cooch show. She's never done that before. I know. I got to figure it out so she can stay with the show. She can stay with the show. What? What do you mean? She can work Greta's joint, the string joint. She can? Well, that would be great. That would be good. It would be better than this shit. How did that start anyway? How do you know? You'll know. The whole story is, who is next to be robbed? Who's the next sucker? That's all you really need to know. Nails, show me some muscle. You got it. Let's go, nails. Let's see some muscle. There you go. Ha ha. All right, now you see these prizes up here -- the television set, hot plate, radio, clocks -- forget about them. They ain't connected to anything, okay? All right, now you see these long strings? They're live, and you use these in case any Mark gets too rangy with you. Which they will. Yes, they will. What's that -- rangy? Rangy -- it's hot, hostile, on your ass. Now if they do that, you let them nibble a long string. Slush them a penknife, cuticle cutters. Girl, those crackers down there, they're going to be waiting for you. You're going to be so busy, you're going to feel like you're going crazy. That's when the fun starts, right? Yeah. Yeah, I'd say so. Ha ha ha. Want to play? Pull a string. Which one do you want? You take it. Damn it, you're going to be a winner tonight. I can tell. I can tell you're going to take it home. Try again. Radio announcer: We need money to buy paper! We need money to buy stamps! We need money to buy tubes for this radio station! [ Changing radio stations ] [ Chorus sings ] [ Turns radio off ] Ha ha ha. [ Coughs ] Frankie. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. [ Grumbles ] Ha ha ha. Man: Solar melts, snow cones, cotton candy -- so big, and they're so goody-good! All right! You got it. One more and you got a prize. Go get 'em. Oh, no! Wait a minute. You're trying too hard.

There you go. That's for you. Now wait a minute. How would you like a chance to really earn some scratch, huh? Who do I got to kill? Ha ha ha! You ain't got to kill nobody. Hey, baby, good luck. You scratch my back, I'll scratch your back. All you got to do is bring your little friends back down here and make one bet, and I'm going to take care of the rest. Sure now, boy?

Yeah, a pleasure, I'm sure. Pleased to meet you. I understand y'all had a little set-to on the strip show back in Charlotte. Oh, that was nothing. That's part of the job. It kind of comes with the dinner, you know? Well, it may cost you. You see, I just bought a massage parlor downtown, plus I got a piece of all the gambling in this area. Now y'all come here with your games and your girlie show, and you start hitting hard. Now ain't that taking money out of my pocket? You know what I mean. The carnival has been coming through here for 50 years, and they do business with whoever's in control of the territory. So listen, I know you're going to be very happy with your piece of the action. Well... It ain't no problem here. Right. Right. Well, now, mm-hmm. I like this town. It's a nice town. If this is the best you can do, I'm going to have to speak to the sanitation commissioner. What kind of shit are you guys trying to pull? You want blood? Heavy, heavy. Let's do business, okay? I'm offering you more than I offer anybody else. If you were a smart man, you'd take it, but you're obviously not too smart a man. Now beyond that, I don't think we got nothing to talk about here. Oh, thank you. And, uh, good luck with your, uh, massage parlor. The girls like you. Go for them, huh? Pull a string, win a prize. Win your date a prize. Everyone's a winner here. Hey. Hi.

Knock down two, win a prize. Ooh! I did it. You should have seen it. I hustled these two chicks. They're sitting there panting, and I don't even know how much I won. I started to count, and then I lost count, then I didn't even care. It was like I knew exactly what was going to happen. I could make it happen just by looking in their eyes. Ooh! It was so weird. It was so strange. It was great! Do I qualify, huh? Do I pass your test? What is this? Do you realize what I just did, how much money I made? Give me this. Maybe. Just maybe you might make it. You're so full of shit. You don't even feel like a Mark anymore. Bastard. Don't. Hey, boy... How come you telling these people them lies? Oh, yes, you do. You're telling people they're going to win a prize. You lying, boy. Hold his arms! [ Woman screams ] Almost full, Frankie. Nails, what's the hurry? Watch your ass.

Watch where you're going! Man: Three for a quarter! Seven for a half! There's nothing wrong with this crowd a funeral wouldn't fix. Ah, look at this.

Why don't you give me some relief and take a bath? Maybe use some gasoline or something. Man: I'll give you a relief. Whatever happened to birth control? [ Thud ] Oh, hey, there they are. We got the three coming -- rubbers, hooches, and morons. Hey, man. Look at this man, old hog-jaw, with the skull and crossbones. I hear you were an unwanted child. Now you're wanted in seven states for making some kids. He's going to pay for this. Hey, Frankie, what's going on? Why don't you go up there and do your job? Are we going to win some money tonight? Let's go. Go do your job. Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Hey, hog-jaw, how does it feel to be a reject? Exactly like he's a fairy. You got a big mouth, boy! Hey! Hey, man, what are you doing? I don't care what I'm doing. Don't rang them up, man. You get out there and do your job. You're ranging them up! Why don't you get out there and do your fucking job? Frankie, don't do it! Whoo!

These banners are fine here. God damn. Ha ha. Boy, these guys play rough. That's one thing. You know, this is pretty good. We can pick up this stuff and put it in the truck. The targets are okay. You checked out the tank? Patch? I got it. I know what we can do. On the way to Savannah, we stop at a lumber store, get US nails and hammers, paint and chicken wire. We can catch the show down in Savannah and be making money by the afternoon. What do you think? I figured it out, huh? You ain't never figured out shit. What? What's the matter with you? Somebody got your goat or something? What do you mean, I -- you ain't never figured out nothing in your whole fucking life. What are you starting with this shit for? Come off that crap. What's that supposed to mean? Why don't you just listen to me? The whole thing's fucked is what it's supposed to mean. We blew it this time. We didn't blow it. You know what's wrong? You're hung up on the chick. What are you talking about, chick? What am I talking about? I'm talking about Donna. Oh, you dumb fuck. What the fuck's the matter with your head? Don't get close to me. Don't fuck with me. Man, patch -- think! They're gone. Look at this shit, man. Why don't you listen to me? The old man -- what the fuck? Wait a minute. Don't walk away from me. Don't fucking touch... I'm just trying to help, is all. What's the matter with you? Come on, patch. Damn. It's not that bad. Why don't you quit blaming yourself? You're just blaming yourself. No, I'm not. Yeah, you are. I'm blaming you. You queer the play. You fuck it all up. We're going to get through this thing, whatever we got to do. We're going to make up for this shit, man, and then you and me, we're going to disconnect. What does that mean? It means you and I disconnect. Oh, bullshit. You don't mean that. What, are you going to quit? What? You ought to get in this cage. You ought to get in this cage once and see what it does to you. Man: Things have got to get better, don't you think? They can't get much worse. They always have. Hey, hey. Collect from the guys. Here we go, here we go. This is hard to swallow. Hey. Okay, Frederick, keep moving. Delno, is the heat here? Yeah. Man with a big appetite. We're in Savannah. Travel money. Tell them I'm sorry. I don't know. Hey, I didn't mean to screw everything up. I didn't want to get in the middle of everything. Do yourself a favor. Don't take credit for it. Don't. You still don't get it, do you? There ain't no room in the middle of those guys. Believe me. Hey, some play the game, some go home. Take care. All right, move it. Get back to work. Oh, would you mind freshening this for me, please? Mr. St. John. Have a seat. Where's your ill-mannered friend Mr. Patch? He ain't here. Good. Well, then we'll get along better already. [ Toilet flushes ] May I present my associate? You fellas kind of stepped on your peckers down in Athens, didn't you? You carnies are supposed to be so smart. Did y'all blame yourselves? Would that be my money then? It's short again. You're making me look bad, chubby. What do I got to do, set fire to your ass? So, how's $7,500 sound to you? Sounds fine. Plus a little bonus for my friend here. He saw something he liked back there in Athens. What was it, skeet? A little blonde, wasn't it? Little gal that works in the string joint. That sound familiar to you? I know who you mean. Well, could you have her here tonight? She'll be here. Good. Well, then your worries are over, Mr. St. John. Your show's going to open. Well, see you boys around, huh? You can count on it. We partners now, chubby. Ha ha ha. Bye. [ Knock on door ] Hey. Ho ho ho ho. How are you doing, kid? Great. Yeah. Packing, huh? Yeah. That what it looks like? Going back to Redding? No. Why would I go back there? Yeah. I don't blame you. Want to stay put, huh? You don't want to travel around like this, huh? Make a life for yourself, relaxed, huh? I understand. Good. Yeah, I understand. I'm ready to pack it in myself. Yeah, well, why don't you? 'Cause I can't stand being had. Neither can I. Hey, Donna, Donna. We're in a bind. We need your help. Yeah, well, I'm in a bind, too. Look, I don't owe nothing. You can take your carnival and stick it right up your ass. Hey, come on, come on. These people mean nothing to you, huh? What about on-your-Mark? He mean nothing to you, too? You recognize that guy?

Come on. Put the bottle down. Turn around. Let me get a look at you. Come on. Stick them little titties out like you done out there. You do like I tell you, or I'm going to bite them off. Did I tell you to do that? I didn't tell you to do that. Now get in there. On your ass. What are you doing? What I'm going to do -- we're going to get down in the mud and the slime where you live. I'm going to do you till your ears leak. I want to hold a man when I make love to him. You want to breathe? You talk when I tell you, or I'm going to make you so ugly your mama won't know you. Now... You bad. You're a bad girl. Now you say that. I'm -- I'm a bad girl. [ Clothes rip ] You bad, so you got to beg me for it. Now you beg me for it. Do it, please. Louder! Louder!

Come right on this way. You doing okay? You okay? No, I'm not okay. This is the ride I started with when I first came to this carnival. Keep that loose change going now. That costs $255,000. It comes from St. Louis. That's where they're built. You think it's going fast? I'm telling you what, son. It can go eight times that fast. Eight, maybe nine. We've had 18 deaths in 2 seasons, and there's no questions asked. They're just heart attacks is all. That's why we call it "the killer." You know what I'm saying. Look under here. Welcome to the palace of wonders, Mr. Dill. That's w.C. Hannon. He runs the place. These people wanted to meet you. This is pooh-bah, a strange midget who has a tongue of steel. And he eats fire, as you can see. His real name's petey, though. This is Emmett, the alligator man. Good evening. This is percilla, his lovely bride. How do you do, Mr. Dill? She's the monkey lady. Hi, percilla. This is Jamie rapp. She's a contortionist, putting her body through those three hoops -- 12 inches, 12 1/2, and 13 inches, and this is her husband Jimmy rapp. Works with swords, knives, daggers, and, uh... Oh. Whoa. Right this way. Johann, could you stand up, sir? Johann is the tallest man in the world. How tall are you, Johann? About 8'2" tall. You know his wedding ring is as big as a silver dollar piece? Fuck your freaks. Where's skeet? Skeet's right this way. He's waiting on you. Skeet? Is that you, skeet? Skeet? Oh! [ Woman laughing ] [ Snoring ] Let's get him out of here. This stuff will wear off in a couple of hours. Here. [ Engine starts ] Go. Holy shit, I'm glad that's over. [ Car drives away ] Can you imagine anybody putting up with the shit we got to put up with just to stay with it here? Can you? Listen, I want to talk to you a minute about that Athens deal. I know what's going on. I know the reason we ain't working out is 'cause you're spreading yourself too thin, and you don't even know it. You're working the joint, and you're on the midway. Do what you and heavy talked about. In a couple of seasons, you're going to be running the whole show. I don't want to get in the way, and, uh... I think we ought to... You know, go our own way there. Try it on our own. You need to be on the midway. Hey, hey, what are you telling me what to do? You don't need the bozo thing anymore. You think I don't know what I want to do? No. Besides, who else is going to put up with you? All right? Yeah, that's right. Huh? Come on. Let's go win some money. Heavy: Hey, hey! I like to see him looking like that. Excuse me. Me, too. Look at pagan. What do you think of pagan, huh, huh? Wait a minute. Whoa. Look at Donna. Donna: Come on, show me your muscles. Don't be bashful. Come a little closer. I got two strings. You pull one out. Go ahead. Tug it real hard. Oh, I'm sorry. It's your tough luck. I bet you make it next time. Why don't you come along and just tug this? Are you going to gawk? Oh, we just came to check you out. Why don't you stick around, maybe learn something? Listen to the hustle on this one. Pull a string. Win a prize. Everyone's a winner here today. You sure you want to play again? Why don't you take it down to midway? Let's go. Need some change? You splash it, I'll cash it. Okay, change for a $5. I got to put on my face. You got to what? Tonight I'm getting in the cage, that's all. You're just going to get sick. You go out and sell the balls to the Mark. I'll give you first count on all you can steal. Well, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll bet you a c-note that you won't last 10 minutes in that son of a bitch. No, I don't want to take your money. Ha ha ha.
