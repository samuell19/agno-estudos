AMIGOMIO Sports... sports... Let's see... D'you want a croissant? - No. Ladies and gentlemen, I shall trouble you for only a moment... As for the team, the question is whether Juan José Lopez is playing... who taught you to drive?! - And Boca? Boca? - Boca. Let's see... Boca has started to train... The usual stuff. Will you pick a club for good today? Why d'you root for River? Well... because there's more of us... and we're better. What else? I'm a River fan... I'm a River fan! A River fan, I am! Goal, Dad! I know. I'm not deaf. Shall we chuck ours? No, it's a Boca goal. In these stands we cheer River. What do you want? - Lift me up. What did I tell you?! God dammit! Amigomio! Don't say you're asleep... The tortilla was a disaster, but we've got Oma's marvellous biscuits... what shall I do now? - Tell me about the trip. Alright. We live in Buenos Aires. Where's Buenos Aires? No, that's Central America. Buenos Aires is here. And today we're leaving for... Tanzania... You know who was born in Tanzania? No. - Tanzan. And after Tanzania we can go to the South Seas... what's that, jerk? - Damn you! Come on! I don't want to. - Let's go! No, I don't want... Come on, don't be afraid... - I don't want to... No, Dad! Hello... what are you doing? - Unsaddling until dawn. What? How can I explain? Imagine a war. In how many ways can you face the enemy? What d'you mean? - "What d'you mean?" There are two ways. One is to show yourself and provoke him. Hello, you fool, here I am! The other is to pose as an idiot, and then... what war, Dad? It's a way of putting it... Morning. - Morning. Excuse me, what was the row about last night? They bumped off the woman of the fifth. A terrorist, it seems... - who did it? Who indeed? The bugaboo! Oh, the bus! Goodbye. - Bye. Wait! Who is it? Carlos. Hello. Hello, dear. - Hello. How are you? - I've got a problem. Can you come later? - No way, no. I've got work. We agreed... - Come in, will you? Hello, uncle. - Hello. Hello, Baku... Hello. Could we talk somewhere else? Don't worry about us... Yes, come. Come on, let's meet some uncles. He's uncle Fabian... Uncle Cosa... The meeting isn't over. Keep him a while. I can't take him with me, I've got to work. You know what this is... - Yes... You can't do this here, it's dangerous... It's my home, isn't it? Yes, it's your home. But there are things we still share. You had a haircut... Morning. - Morning. I represent the Bratpfanne company. We offer Teflon pans... The lady's not in right now, sir. Thank you. You're welcome. Good morning, sir. Bratpfanne are offering these great... - Pieces of shit. Excuse me? - I say they're shit! Can't you keep a civil tongue? - Not with crooks! You fat slob! - It's your mother who's fat. Don't mention my mother, damn you! You sonofabitch! Hello, man... How did you find me? Just by chance, I was... You're selling pans? - Yes. Before you used to sell politics... we sold together, didn't we? - Used to. Now it's better to... How incredible... why don't you come round tonight? - It's a deal. Right. - Bye. See you. Say... You don't need one? - I have one. I can understand... Germans calling Brandt or Marlene "traitors"... what? I say that I understand it. They worked for the enemy against their own people. Against their own people? - That's right. Their own people. Whose own people? - Quarrelling again? Try my biscuits and my apple strudel and quit it. I won't hear any more. Karl! Please! You said you'd come in the evening! Must you shout? You're more provincial by the day. And you, are older and more Bavarian. You've come for your son? - Yes, for a walk. He's playing in the garden. That child needs a home. He can't go on like a tennis ball. Come on, old girl... - Don't call me old girl! Well, Dad? She's getting insufferable with age. Harder, harder... Know who was inside? - No. Mr. Pérez and Mrs. Gonzalez. - Were they going to China? That one's going to India. Are there Indians in India? - Of course. Come. What's on your mind, Dad? I'm thinking about flying, Amigomio. And about landing. Pauli, where did I get? To Quito. - You're lying, it doesn't exist. You remember Jaime? He beat it to Europe. Was he involved in something? - I don't know. Dad, is Nadia in Quito? Quito's a mosquito. Not everyone who leaves, flees. - This is still a great place to live. You just need brains. These are mountains. - What's with the roads then? The level of intelligence is measured... - Are there roads... Amigomio, leave the car there. Why does his father call him Amigomio? - It's his name. ...by a person's ability to adapt to change. Those who can't, have to go. - Papa... Isn't it true? - No, dear, no. Where do you live? - In a borrowed house. What is his name? - My name is Carlos. You can't continue with that job. - Yes, so? What's Amigomio's name, Dad? - He said Carlos. Carlos. - What about advertising? I've no experience. - It'd be something new. Unless you have... ideological objections. Me? No, I don't. See? My name is Carlos. Your ex-wife lost something with you. - I don't know. I don't think I lost too much with her. Well, that's that. The essential is imperceptible. What are you talking about? - Spices. For me, separation came as a shock. Overcoming failure is tough. One must be ready for a life of failures. Compared with our dreams, my job in the bank is a failure. When you think of our dreams, our plans... Treason. Why not call it treason? I've learnt to find the "nothingness" of the senses. Pure orientalism, boy. - Papa! What happened? What happened? Nothing, we were playing bugaboo and he got frightened. He broke the lamp. - He's still a kid! That boy lives immersed in terror. - What do you mean? He needs a normal life, a normal mother! Quit picking on Negra! - Don't you realize you're a puppet? We're waiting for a taxi. Oh, Amigomio, why didn't you warn me? I should have taken you to have a pee. What happened? You're too old to pee your bed. I want to go to Mom's. I'll tell you a story of my childhood. One night we were walking through the fields, and we suddenly saw a light. The country boys call it "Evil Light"... It's something like the bugaboo... Later my Dad took me to see it, and it was the phosphorescence... from the bones of cows. Phopho... what? You here? Are you surprised? Not too much, I always suspected this moment would come. Are you afraid? Maria de Fatima... Hello, Amigomio. - Hello, Mom. Morning, ma'am! - Morning. Well... as you've got your day off, I propose going to the Plaza Francia... and then we can go home for some cutlets with fries. There's a serious problem. I have absolutely no time today. - Alright. I can't, Carlos. You know I can't. Always the militant. The conversation's over. You talk as if the struggle were a sin. You? I don't swap my life for my ideas. I haven't got the guts to be a martyr. That's your problem. Nothing to do with me. My fears have to do with you. I'm scared about you. Alright, we'll meet here at seven and go for those cutlets... that you promised. Right? Oh, dammit! Caught his fingers again... will you come, Mom? - Yes, love. The day that you love me... Thanks. I hope you won't be late, for once. Hello, Betty. - Hello. This is Tomasito, my nephew. My brother's son. He was kidnapped two months ago. With his wife. We know nothing about them. They left the child with a neighbour. I fetched him. What does the kid know? He... doesn't talk. Won't say a word. Dad... Yes? Tomasito said you must buy me a real gun. What do you want a real gun for? Children don't play with guns. Tomasito said it's to kill the evil people who kill parents. You can be sure nobody's going to kill your Mom or me. I don't know anything. Tomasito said it. Amigomio, I don't know what Tomasito said, but listen here: It's important that you keep quiet about this. Do you understand? It'd be very dangerous if someone heard you! I won't tell anyone. Only you. Dammit... I can tell you, can't I? When will Mom come? - Who knows? And she told us to be punctual... what the hell am I doing here? We don't look like refugees... what are those people doing? - Amusement of the rich. Throwing coins into the water. Like in a zoo... Are you sure this is Tigre? - Of course. You want to ask the police? - No, it's all right. Let's keep looking. Go on. I thought I saw a light. Where's Mom? I'm hungry. I know, you said. Hold on a while. Stop over there. I'm going to ask. Here? - Over there. Shit! Is anything wrong? No... The house is there, and so's the river. There must be another entrance. Try to get closer. Alright. Carlos! You got here! Duque! And Amigomio? - He's on the boat. Shall I get him? Poor kid, he's finished. I'll take him to bed. What's wrong? Why all this mystery? We don't know if it's a birth or a funeral. It's simply that... Negra's disappeared. How's that? We had a date. She never arrived. And at her place nobody answers. What have you done to verify this? I rang up the old folk, told them, and beat it. Let's hope it's not like that. Because... I don't know if you understand. Yes, it's risky... You know we were involved... - Yes. I'm only asking you to let us stay until it is confirmed. Confirmed, yes. - Confirmed by who? My brother-in-law. He knows. Easy... Uncle Edi! Why are you here? Bad news. What? Anything new? No, nothing. She was abducted. Our parents are looking for her. Edi! Get lost here. - How can I? Look, right now you're a leper here. It's only the cops who want you. Get it? What about Negra? Only our parents can help. Edi! Come and fish with me! We also want you to go. I've brought you some clothes. I also told your old folk. The best course is to leave the country. Did Mom come? I'll boil some water. Nice weather... I have a friend in Quito who works for a firm... a German firm... See? Look at it carefully. It's the same earth. Wherever you go, the same grass... the same worms. There's no reason to feel foreign. The next day they left very early, and gave each child a piece of bread. As they walked Hansel dropped crumbs, so as to know the way back. "Hansel" asked his father, "why do you keep looking back? Carry on!" And Hansel answered: "I'm saying goodbye to my little dove on the roof." "You dolt!" said his stepmother. "That's no dove..." "It's the sun coming up behind the chimney." Dad... will you remember the way home? That's what maps are for. I'll show you. Look. This is Argentina... our country. We're somewhere around... here. And we're going to carry on through here... to Ecuador and a city called Quito. What for? Beca... I'll explain later. Tickets, please... Your tickets, please. Your ticket, sir. - Oh, yes. Tickets, please... Listen... I'm going to tell you a secret. Remember our talk? - About Tomasito? Yes. What happens is... that those who are governing Argentina... You understand? You know what governing means? All countries have governments. They are the people who organize and lead the rest. You understand? More or less. They are people who... may or may not have been chosen by us. They may have grabbed power by force... with all their weapons, the army... and that's what we now have here. It's a government that we didn't choose, they took power by force. Am I clear? More or less. It's like theft. What's theft? When someone gets what he wants with a gun, or through deceit. You understand? What don't you understand? Mom and I are against people being robbed. That's the reason we're in danger. In danger? Yes. Mom hasn't appeared since that day on the plaza. And probably... I fear the military may have taken her... into custody. Taken into custody? Yes, imprisoned. Like the thieves? Well, if the people in charge, who rule and make the laws are criminals, everything is topsy turvy. The decent people are put in jail. Is she in Quito? No. I don't know where she can be. I only know that they came home to get me too. That's what Uncle Edi told me. - Will they take Uncle Edi too? No, not him. I don't want Mom in jail... Neither do I. You said nobody wanted to kill you! - Don't shout! Why didn't you want a gun? - Because I didn't know. No one did. None of us knew. - Yes, you did! I'm telling you I didn't. - Yes, you did. True. You're right. What could I do with a gun? I never even killed a fly. You think it's like playing cowboys? - But you're grown up! Why's the train stopped? - Who knows. But it'll be a long stop. How do you know? There, the engine driver and the guards are going away. Probably to drink maté at some relative's. This is madness! Why do you keep the door closed? Documents, everybody. Documents, your documents. Your documents. I don't like these diesel engines. The steam ones were never surpassed. They were alive. Once I drove one... well, I just wanted to say I'm happy. You acted fast. It surprises you? No. I always expected such things of you. I don't know why. If you turned me into a nobody. Here's where I get it. - It's true. Who am I going to risk my neck for? The poor? If I am a bourgeois... what about the proletarian revolution? - Enough. I've heard it all before. - So what's the problem? Did you bring Amigomio's woollens? It gets cold. Yes, I did... You know what the problem is? Look... I'm a stranger amongst these people. Where can I go? To Europe? I'd be another stranger there. Which is my world, dammit? I'm an international gringo. - Only if you want to be one. The fight for justice is universal. But you can't understand what you don't love. You know something? I'm no hero. I'm sorry, old man. I want to go to the bathroom. What? - I want to pee. It's for the wild beasts. MILITARY: ASSASSINS OF THE PEOPLE I don't know how we'll cross the border. I haven't got your papers. I didn't think of it. What did you say? - That I haven't got your documents. What? - Your documents... your papers. Don't worry. - What? No worries, I can give you a hand... I haven't got his papers... - You know what happens? Lately there's been a lot of child smuggling. Of course. - But I don't pry into anyone's business. What are you hinting at? - I'm not hinting at anything. But the kid doesn't look too much like you. Cut it out. Listen, you do as I tell you. Once you get to the border... Excuse me, is this bus going to Potosi? - Yes, to Potosi. And that's on the way to La Paz? - No... It's a different bus for La Paz. Damn it! We're saved, aren't we, Dad? - We took the wrong bus. Is there danger here too? Yes, there is danger here too. - Damn it... what's up? Don't like Indios? No, the problem is that this gentleman confuses the main and secondary contradictions. The main contradiction is the class struggle and not the racial issue... Your analysis is flawed. The main contradiction is the fight for independence. The gentleman is affected by class conditioning and concomitant bourgeois racism. - Look! In his book "The Quechuan Question", Marx mentions a selfish trait that we've inherited from our religion and our mercantile tendencies. All men get off, to push. Again to push! Really, I don't know what crap they're selling. But I'm hungry. I think they've got grilled meat over there. Wait for me. I am Christoph. I speak, one hour. You come? I wait. I wait for you. Don't trust strangers. Eat up, the bus is going to leave. Dear people of Bolivia! Brethren of the great Tawantinsuyo! You will remember Christ... He is the flame of revolution, and we follow him! We Latin-Americans are apostles in the struggle against capitalism! Dad! They're taking him! - A-ha? The police. In Ecuador I'll have a litre of coffee. He has to be rescued. Maybe, but not by me. I've enough trouble with your documents. Amigomio! Let's get off! - Wait... Potosi is not far off. - But those are bombs! It's my hometown festivities... Five bolivianos. How much? - Five bolivianos. Five? The most expensive pee of my life. You mustn't cheat the gringos like that. Or what will they think of us? You old crow! I said fifty centavos. - Give him fifty centavos. You old trickster... - I said fifty centavos, sir. I am Toro Salinas, I would like to be your guide. This city is not too healthy. You know it's fiesta? Get in my car. But it's packed. - Don't worry, we'll take you. You're Germans? Or Americans? I'm not feeling well. - You need a maté. You think so? You don't seem like tourists. Strange, we only get tourists here. You've certainly not come to work. We're passing through, we might even leave today. Please, children. Come in. I like people who are always passing through. As if escaping. I said nothing of the sort. I've brought you some gringo friends. I need a room for both of us. Can't he speak Spanish? - He can. Yes, of course. Do the rooms have bathrooms? - Of course. In the corridors Are you Americans? - Yes, like you. We're Argentines. - Ah, Argentines. An Argentine president was born close by. Who, Peron? - No, Saavedra. Leave your bags, I'll show you around Potosi. I need a travel agency. And I'm not feeling well. Don't worry. Fix him a coca maté. He must have mountain sickness. Coca, just what I need! I'll take you to a travel agency. They're gringos on the run! - Shut up, will you? Potosi has been declared an international heritage site... It's important to us. - Look, Dad, that man again! Struggle against capitalism! I believe in Christ... in Karl Marx, and in Pablo Picasso. All of you are artists. You lead artistic lives... you are creators of life... Take it easy, nobody will hurt you here. Death is not for gringos in Potosi. Pachamama only goes after her children Come this way. - What about the bus terminal? Right after. Try it. Hit the hill with the pick. Not now... - Come on... Go ahead, Dad. Go on. Let's see. Oh, no, harder! You must hit it harder. Harder! As if you were a miner! This wealth has other owners. If you had hit harder, it would have been in Quechua. Pachamama must be offered the best. Drop that! Dad... what did you do with the heart? - What? I'm hungry. Buy me a corncob... - No way. We'll see if we can find a restaurant. What would you like? Have you grilled meat? - No, only chicken. Grilled chicken? - No, Bolivian chicken. Alright, make it two. Easy on the spice, please. The guy from the plaza! When I spoke... you didn't come. Why? I was working. And today, you come? Yes? They're taking him away again! - We've got to keep away from that guy. They're taking him where Mom is? - Yes. No. I don't know. Let's follow them! - You watch too many action films. We must go unnoticed. We don't have documents. You never do anything! - Don't you understand? No! The nothingness of senses. - What? Nothing important, something Tony said. - Nothing important... I think that like the great men of my country... I shall die in exile. Where? Don't get ill... Help me... Don't worry. It's only "phosphorence." What happened? - A little mountain sickness, that's all. Give me a break... May I know why you didn't wait for me? What? I did wait for you! All night long! Aw, come on! It's always the same. I can't rely on you. Where's Amigomio? - Here with me. Dad! Put this on. Oh, damn it! Bloody mountain sickness. Come, Amigomio, we'll go and get some medicine. Mom buys it in drugstores. - Of course. What's wrong, man? What do you think? An ecological problem. Damn Puna, eh? You're telling me! Fine guerilla you'd have made! Never crossed my mind. I have an idea. Here you don't go to a drugstore: You have to go to the market and see the witches. You're kidding. - Come, I'll take you. Hurry up, your Dad's losing blood! He even pulls my leg... I can imagine you, mountain sick, addressing the masses. Hello... Good afternoon... Give this gringo some herbs for a session. Who's going to do it? - Doña Sofia. Doña Sofia wants no gringos. He's Argentine, like me. Give him mystery stuff... Sun, Moon... Virgin most pure, glory to the Child most holy... Nostroamo, Tata Bemberi... heart and star. And a little q'uwita too. Here. Llama untu too. You better put parsley in your nose to stop it bleeding. I'll put some... - My nostrils will be stretched! It doesn't matter, the bleeding will stop. And if not, I'll give you some starch. Dad, look what I got. What are you buying? - I wish I knew. Doña Sofia, may I speak my mind? I am white. You're telling me the gaucho gave it to you? I mean it. When we were at the market... wait a while. Leaving for Sucre, leaving for Sucre! Come with us. We're the police. - I'll miss my bus... Come, stay close. I'll lose my bags! - Don't worry... I shall destroy you, Mark Aurelius. As you have destroyed me. If odette gets to know, I promise I shall kill you. Kill me, if you have the courage to do so. Kill me and my child. Come on. The commissioner's waiting. Good morning. - Not so good. Can I have your documents? Is this boy your son? - Of course. It's not so evident. - He has my name. Show me the document that proves it. - He's my son. Aren't you? You see? - Don't play it candid, man. I face ten child-robbers a week. With children named after them? - This can be easily forged. So can any certificate. - True... So we'll ask for your Argentine records. Why pick on me? - Your documents are not in order. And he doesn't resemble you. We're similar. - He's dark, you're fair. 'Cause my wife is dark. - Where is she? She's not here. I got photographs. She's in jail. - Is that so? Look, my wife. She's dark. Not even his eyes are fair. Dark genes are stronger than fair ones. Were that true, everybody'd be black. - Have you ever seen a white who had mixed parents? I've never seen blacks marry whites. Blacks marry blacks, and... How much? - Five hundred. What? - Dollars, of course. That's all I have. - So you have enough. Careful! Five hundred and fifty. Thanks for your help. Saying Mom's in jail, then shooting... - I didn't shoot. I'm tired. I'm hungry. We're in a mess. I haven't got a buck left. I don't want to go on. Alright, let's do something. You keep an eye on the luggage while I make a call. Right? What's wrong with the telephones here? What the hell are you doing? Are you crazy? I was helping you! - Begging is no help! Money is made... ...in other ways. You understand? - No! And I'm going home! Amigomio, come here! Don't get cross! We could sell that knife too. - No. They'd give us a lot for it. C'mon, hand it over. Let's hope it'll last. The more we advance, the worse we are. What's the matter, Amigomio? We're having fun. Nice adventures... aren't they? What's the matter? - I want to see Grandpa... I can understand... but... my friend... remember the military. I want my Mama... All right, you return and I carry on alone. Nothing will happen to you, anyway. The only thing is... who'll look after me... what you said about the gaucho... But it's alright, I don't need help. When we get to Quito we'll return home. I promise you we'll return as soon as we can. Allow me to talk. A speech. Thank you. Dear brethren! I talk because always time to reflect. There are millions of poor, and much injustice, you must take responsibility... You're good if you fight for change. - Sir, please sit down. I allowed, he allow me. - I did not understand the question. Only three words. - There are rules. Otherwise, you'll have to get out. Where is freedom? - Get out, sir! But sir, look... - I said you have to get out, sir! You're disturbing the passengers. He said get out, mister. Don't forget to deposit dollars as you go. I no have. - We take cash, cards, anything. Come on... who's the leader of your band? - This is no band. Or is this a trumpet? Fine. I want to talk to your leader. There is none, so talk. I haven't got a buck, I mean a boliviano... we're on the run. Pepe! Here's a tourist asking us for money! I'm no tourist! - Who are you fleeing? The military government. - That swine Videla? Who's this? Your son? - We're in danger. Hey, listen, There's a gringo here wanting to join us. A tall guy who can't speak? - Yes. Kill him. Were you in the struggle? No, not me. She... what did you do? The errands? - No, I... in democracy... what democracy? Didn't you try to save her? Well, no... Isn't this road a bit dangerous? Slightly. I have a knife. That'll be useful. - He takes after his mother. The other gringo? Was he with you. - No, but what happened to him? He stayed behind to teach tourists. By the way... remind me of the documents. Now that we are... a bit easier with each other, could you tell me who you are? - The less you know, the better. All I can tell you is that we're the Tolata Heroes Movement. It rings no bell. Course not. This is our first operation. Ah, that's why... Get ready, we're on the Peruvian border. What do I do? Nothing. Not a single word, right? Shall I draw my knife? You're worried about your son? No... I... no... Later we'll leave messages in bottles. Good morning. We're looking for a bus with a Bolivian license. Seen any? A red one, with green stripes? No, it's white with blue stripes. With subversive elements. "Elements"? - People. Not even a beetle has passed by. - Where are you going? Some place where we can get a lift. What he say? - He wants to lift a glass. No bars around here. - We want to take a bus. A bus... the best place is the ruins. There's always buses there. We'll take you. - Alright. No, they're policemen. - It's alright. Want to hear the siren? - The siren! What are these rocks? At one time this was a temple, you know? - No. The Incas had a great empire... until the Spaniards came in. Why is it destroyed? Because the Spaniards got nervous when they invaded. Perhaps because Incas spoke no Spanish. Are they Incas? No, theirs is another empire. Quick! Come! The purse! Wait! Does Pérez live here? Could you tell me... I swear there was someone here. What time can it be? We'll miss the appointment. - I hurt my arm. Show me. That's nothing, big man. Let's see if it's over. It seems it's late. - What's that? Nothing. Come. Quick, your documents. I be tourist. - You're come from the Heroes? Well, yes... - Here are the documents. What happened? You were late. - Transport, you know... Get lost. The situation's tough. I'd like to... - Beat it! How much do I owe you? Come on, Quito! We've arrived! Now we'll have a house with palm trees, coconuts... Monkeys and parrots... but then we return home. First we want news from Buenos Aires. - But soon, Dad. As soon as we can, we beat it. Let's get off. Oh, damn... - Hello, friends. The world's a handkerchief. My name's Christoph Claudius Anton... Call me "Gringo". My name is Carlos, this is my son, Amigomio. I no understand... My name is Carlos Löwenthal. Licenciado Löwenthal! Excuse me. Yes, ma'am, it's me. Licenciado Löwenthal, how are you? I'm Amparo Concepción de Gonzalez de Ochoa... But what happened? Problems during your trip? The trip. Alright, let's go. - Let's go. 'Bye. - 'Bye, friends. Our manager has prepared everything for you, every detail. I'd love to see Buenos Aires! They say it's bigger than Miami! Is it true? - I don't know Miami. Really, Licenciado? Yes, and don't call me Licenciado. - Licenciado Victor rang from Argentina. Uncle Victor? Yes, to tell us that you'd be late. - Anything else? Did he leave a message? - He said the weather was fine. Great, isn't it? FOR THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN DIGNITY welcome to your new home. I hope you feel comfortable. At least I don't need transport to go to work. If you need anything, Licenciado, just call. Thanks. Don't call me Licenciado. Your belongings are in the back. 'Bye. Goodbye, Licenciado. 'Bye, thank you. There's plenty of room... where's the house? It seems it's this one. Well... let's unpack! Let's see the purse... what have we here? Look at all we have. Here. Look... I bet you don't remember when we took it. I want to go home. - We've just arrived. I don't want to live here. - Have patience. What if Mom's at home? Didn't Christoph escape? Yes, but that's beside the point. - Why don't you want? Why? Should we phone Buenos Aires? Hello, to Buenos Aires? Thank you. Hello, Grandma. Yes, I'm fine. Dad too. Is Grandpa Franz there? Hello, Grandpa... yes, Oma, yes... Ah, he's working. What? Boca won against Talleres? Do you want to hear something funny? But don't tell Dad I told you. We moved into a beautiful, tropical-style house... with palm trees? No, how can that be... we seem like Uruguayans. Where did you get that from? How can it have monkeys? It's not a zoo. And we also bought a powerful car... no, not a racing car. No, Dad doesn't want to watch soccer... he says he doesn't like the way they play here... he's always saying he can't adapt... I don't know... Let me tell you... Airplanes can't fly in this weather. We'll try again tomorrow. Clarin, please. - We got few papers today, they're taken. - I reserved Clarin! You'd leave me without a newspaper? Sorry, sir. - Then give me chewing gum, cigarettes... and the Grafico. Cigarettes, gum... and the Clarin. - How about La Nacion? Alright, La Nacion. But quick, I'm drenched. Here. My change. Thank you. Excuse me! We can share it if you want. - There's my car. No. There. This is Amigomio... This is... - I'm Diana. Pass me the Grafico. I hope it's complete. What section do you want? - Any. Just not the completed crossword. D'you want a maté? - Alright... This was a brave passenger... NONE OF THE DISAPPEARED STILL ALIVE Dad in love is as graceful as a monkey. You were right, Grandpa... e do have a monkey now. How cool all this is... You work in the same company? - Very good... Ecuador is a marvellous country for enterprising young people. Yes, yes, marvellous. Our young Hartung is a good example. He's played his hand well. He works a lot, makes a lot and even invests in this country. Have you seen his beautiful new house? Made of blood, sweat and tears... Not really... - I didn't mean yours. Come with me, sir. I'm coming... As usual... it's nothing. I'm not the only one who got rich, right Karl? I didn't know you spoke German so well, Dad. Yes, of course. Marvellous. You're a show-off. But Grandpa and Grandma are German, aren't they? No, they are Argentine. Now they are Argentine. And I am Ecuadorian. At dusk, only the chirping of the cacuy would be heard. Turay, turay... goes the cacuy. But he can only be heard, he's never seen... hen I die, I want it to be out in the hills... to see the stars. And don't you cry or start making noise... because I want to hear his call: Turay... Turay. Hich means "friend". We'll soon be having meat at dinner again... were the tickets expensive? Quite. The Argentine government should have subsidized exiles... Don't be silly. Who needs you there? Negra. I'm a witness in the trial of the military... Is it nice to play hero, Tarzan? I know escape is never heroic. Exile grants no laurels. Excuse me... I'm hurt. Come with me. - No. My history book is closed. No more Buenos Aires gloom. My life is Ecuador, salsa and coffee made with boiling water. Did you tell him your father died? How did he take it? Like me. He took it badly. Pass to me! You need more guts. You shouldn't keep out of the thick. Are you listening? - We couldn't group right. How could we realize our scheme? You talk like a soccer commentator. Where did you pick that up? Won't you tell me? But we were superior. - That's rot. Soccer games are won by goals. D'you want to eat at home? Who's cooking? - I am... who else? It's always the same. Noodles, pancakes, sausages... when will you change? - Why don't you try cooking? Genius. Dinner! Amigomio, dinner! Not sausages, pancakes, or noodles. This is called "Coq au vin". It sounds better than chicken in wine. What's the matter? - I don't like it. Alright, don't eat. I've made a decision. My place is over there. I can't wait longer. I won't go to Argentina. - You'll stay here alone? Yes. I won't go. - Your country is Argentina. I don't know the place. I live here. That's because your friends are here. Over there you'll get new friends, a new school... I've a plan... - I won't! And I hope the military stay forever! Shit-hole of a country! You see? You're all shitty military! Argentines are shit! I am a chullita from Quito, so fond of life... what are those people doing? Amusement of the rich. Throwing coins into the water. Like in a zoo...
