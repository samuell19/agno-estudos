(suspenseful orchestral music) - It's coming. - Winds are 35 and the pressure's dropped. Any type of low level winds, we might even get a twister. - One can only hope, huh? But just remember, that's still only a theory, Professor. It looks like the sky's full of surprises. Kinda reminds me of our wedding day. (giggles) - Alright, time for me to hit the skies. - Okay. See you later. - Yeah. - How are you doin' up there? - Good. But you better get on the horn, this thing's gonna left foot through. Tell them to upgrade to a category four. - This is unit three, I have a severe storm warning for Green Bow and the surrounding counties. I repeat, Green Bow and the surrounding counties, over. - I'm in the core, how's the mapping read down there? - Beautifully. You better get down from there. I'll see you on the other side, Professor. (thunder claps) What was that? - Cloud bursts. (thunder claps) - Jamie? - Yeah? - We got major instability and the lifted index is dropping. The ion count is really jumpin' here! - Oh my god. Jim? Jim! - Yeah. (thunder claps) (yelps) - Jim, do you read me? (somber orchestral music) (thunder claps) (strong wind blows) Okay, we've got enough data, let's get some readings! - Winds are up to 40 from the west! - Okay, what about the pressure? I want numbers at 500 and 1,000 millibars. - The pressure's dropped. - How are you doin' up there? - I think I see an anvil cloud, and it looks like cloud-to-cloud lightning bolts! - Come on, we don't have all day. The storm's getting closer! - You're right! I think the wind says 65! - Read the numbers! Right there, it says 70! Collins, would you pay attention? Look again, now it's 75! You're gonna kill us all if you don't pay attention. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Yes, I understand. We'll look forward to seeing you then, sir. Bye. Secretary wants to discuss funding again when he gets here. - What? They've already cut us to the bone. - Well, they're not done yet. What have you got? - Tornado in Northern Colorado. Moved across the Laporte basin. We got 26-plus dead. A supercell near the Fox Bow Mountains, the tornado touched down then moved east. - Fox Bow? Isn't that where they built the Pine Feather facility? - Yeah, touched down six miles from there. But, that's not the problem. - These figures can't be right. - Oh yeah, they're right, I had the data double-checked and confirmed with the weather service. There was definitely a low-precipitation supercell. But here's what's really strange, there wasn't any rain. - [Boss] We need to get somebody out there. - FEMA has a crew and already they're housing hundreds in hotels and shelters. Satellite shows more unstable weather arriving, too. - I wanna send Jamie, do you think she can handle it? - They've already had one storm hit. Although she does seem better lately. Less destructive, I guess. - No, it's all wrong. Let's try it again. - Oh, she's much better. - I dropped outta the reserves for this? - Hey, wait a second. I was in the middle of something in there. - Yeah, scaring the life out of every recruit we have. - Oh, please. - These people volunteer to be storm spotters. 75% of them drop out after one training session with you. Look, you're going to Colorado. Tornado touched down, did a lot of damage. - No, I have a chase in Texas next week. - You had a chase, Laporte's a declared disaster area. I wanna know what happened and you're going to find out. - Okay, I'll just take an SSV and drive down there tomorrow. - The SSV stays here, we've got a budget review, and we can't afford any more of your recklessness. You'll fly to Laporte. - What? Frank. - Jamie, look, if you need a severe storms van, we'll get you one, otherwise I don't want you cranking one up for kicks. - [Reporter] Fire season arrived with a vengeance last month in California and these images of the community of Crescent City remain indelible for the residents there. We have this report from Northern California. - After fires killed six and did millions in damage, Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel are now ready to leave. Wallace Houston is Operations Director in charge for FEMA. It must feel good to finally move your people out, Wallace. - Oh, it really does. Now the hard work really starts for these people. I just hope that we've given them a solid start into rebuilding their community and their lives. That's the most we can really ask for. - Hey, buddy. - What's happening, Smitty? - So you and Melanie are goin' to Maui. - Who told you that? - Well, I heard a rumor. Melanie's coming back for the ring? - A ring? - Yeah. She's a great gal. Really. - I can't wait to get outta here. Think about it, two weeks in paradise. - Melanie, (sighs) we never confirmed this trip. - Well, come on, we've been talking about this for weeks. - Have you been telling everyone we're getting engaged? - Everyone? I mentioned something to Vicky and Lexi, but I was just kidding around. - Melanie, every time we spend a few weeks together in a disaster site, you decide the next step is marriage. - I think it's time you get off the road and settle down. - Isn't that my decision to make? - Well, when are you gonna decide? (telephone rings) (telephone rings) - Stanton. - [Wallace] It's Wallace, we've got trouble, Will. A tornado touched down in Colorado and it looks bad. I'd like you to get your crew of guys out there. Of course, I mean, I'll understand if you wanna stick around and finish up-- - Tonight, Wallace? - [Wallace] Yeah. - Okay, if you need me, I'm there. - [Wallace] Oh thanks, Will, I knew I could count on you. I'll try to get there myself by tomorrow. Thanks again. - Alright. Sorry. - Tough call. Melanie and Maui, a town hit by a tornado. She sure doesn't look too happy. - [Will] Let's go, Smitty, we've got a job to do. (Jamie sighs) - Jamie, I just got the latest 96-hour forecast model for Laporte. I'm afraid the jetstream's gonna pump in unstable air for another week. - Listen, Frank, let me take the SSV. I get so much more work done with it. - Jamie, drop it, we can't even insure these things anymore because of you. You know, the strange thing is, that tornado is deviant. We haven't had one in that area for 100 years. Oh, FEMA's Director of Operations has been briefed on you. While you're out there, use the time to do some thinking. You know, it's been two years since he died. - You know I'm only trying to finish what Jim started. - I know. Oh, one other thing. Commercial flights to Laporte have been delayed. We've arranged alternate transportation for you. Good luck. - Great. (somber orchestral music) (background chatter) - This looks real bad, Smitty. - [Reporter] Residents in Colorado are reeling this early morning, looking for survivors of last night's deadly tornado that touched down unexpectedly and ripped a destructive path. Rescuers says at least 20 are known dead, as the search continues for survivors. - How you doin'? Get all these other tents secured. I don't want the wind blowing them away. - [FEMA Agent] I can help whoever's next here. - Alright, Will, this is what we've got. Preliminary reports indicate 50 apartment complexes lost in the downtown area, at least 300 homes gone. - That's bad, listen, who's doing the airport run? - I was supposed to, but I'm waiting for the inspectors to come in, do you want me to go? - No, I'll go. Find out who made this coffee, it's horrible. - I did. - Thanks. - Miss Marshall? Welcome to Laporte! - I'm late, I missed the entire sunset. - We're from the United Methodists in Eaton. Bless you for coming to help, dear. Where are you joining us from? - Oklahoma. I'm a weather researcher, I'm here to investigate the storm. - The Lord knows you're here, child. - Hey, hey, hey, careful! - Excuse me. - Where is Wallace Huston? - Uh, Houston? They're in meetings all night. Why don't you go check into the hotel, come back tomorrow? Wallace is in around, what, seven? - Yeah. - Seven AM. - Great, watch this stuff. - Where did Miss Congeniality come from? - Center for Severe Storms Research. They sent her here to study the place. - Weather readings, huh. It's good she won't have to use those people skills. (both laugh) - Look, I can't stay there, that place is a zoo. I've got a lot of work to do. - Oh! Well, today's your lucky day. Because if you don't wanna stay in the hotel, we have some lovely cots and tents over at the FEMA Center over there. Or, um... You can go camp. - Great. Camping it is. - Do you want a hand with the stuff? - Don't touch 'em. - I think she's crazy about you. - You really think so, huh? - No. (warm orchestral music) - Hey, guys, everyone hanging in there? Alright, tomorrow, we need to get damage and salvage assessment. Also, I know everyone's gettin' sick of me sayin' this, but we really need to stabilize as many structures as possible. I want this tent population to a minimum. (suspenseful orchestral music) - Seven miles east of the mountains. Initial damage observations indicate an F3, possibly an F4 tornado. And the current wind conditions are steady out of the southwest at 10 miles per hour. (sighs) Why is Frank doing this to me? (alarm rings) (strong wind blows) (suspenseful orchestral music) Wind sheer here? (thunder claps) This shouldn't be happening. (peaceful orchestral music) (birds tweet) (background chatter) - Hi, may I help you? - Oh yeah, um, I'm looking for a Wallace Houston. Somebody said he'd be in by seven, but I can't seem to find him anywhere. - You found him, I'm Wallace. - Oh, (chuckles) god, I'm sorry. Jamie Marshall with the Center for Severe Storms Research. - Oh, you know what, I've been in a lot of disaster sites before and I have never, ever had anyone send out a storm researcher before. What is so special about this one? - Well, a tornado touching down in this area's very unusual. Listen, I need to get out to track the storm's path, and I was wondering if there was a vehicle I could borrow? Van, truck, anything? - No, you're gonna have to hitch a ride. Vehicles are at a premium out here. But, you know what? Find Will Stanton, he's my field coordinator. He's gotta go out there anyway, you talk to him. Oh, would you excuse me? I'm so sorry. - Thanks. - There's bad news at the airport. They're expecting to take at least three weeks before they'll be operating again. - Oh, well, we're just gonna have to keep rerouting them through Denver and then shuttling them back and forth from Laporte as best we can. (playful orchestral music) - Excuse me. - [Will] Excuse me, ladies. - I'm sorry to have broken up your little audience, but could you help me find a Will Stanton? - Well, that would be me. - You? - Tell me something, are you always like this, or is it just for my benefit? - I thought you just drove vans. - Call me multi-talented. (Jamie chuckles) - Look, I have to get out to track the storm's path, and I was wondering, uh, well, Wallace said you'd give me a ride. - She did? - Mm-hm. - Great. Let's go. (upbeat orchestral music) So what exactly are you lookin' for out here? - I'll let you know when I find it. Radar? There's radar here? - Hey, hey, hey! (Jamie screams) (dramatic orchestral music) - Hey! - Back in the car! Have you got a death wish or something? - Radar up here makes no logical sense, okay? - Look, I don't add to casualty lists, you got that? - Alright! Fine, sorry. Can we go check that out, please? (suspenseful orchestral music) Oh my god. It's a Doppler radar setup. Tracks storms. Wind velocity, rotation, precipitation. - Look, I know what Doppler is. - I might set up here. Who else would need Doppler information? - I have no idea, look, we don't have time for pictures. Let's go. - It's a Field Imaging Mapper. It gives me landscape data for storm analysis. - Oh, well, hurry up. How much longer? - I'll be a while. - I'll be at the truck. (background chatter) (moody orchestral music) - Damage to homes indicate wind speeds of about 200 miles an hour, maybe more. Ground swirls that I observed indicates a single vortex with rapid vertical motion. - Alright, Jason, get all your guys together. Have them look for anything that's salvageable, alright? Get the trucks in here, start cleaning this place up. Alright, start right there in that area. - Excuse me, Will? I need to get back to those hills. - Well, Jamie, I've still got a lot of work to do here. - So let me take the truck and I'll come back and pick you up later. - Look, I need the truck, alright? And secondly, you're not the priority here. - I'm just trying to do my job. - I'll try and get you back out there tomorrow, alright? (playful orchestral music) - Okay! - Get those trucks in here now! (melancholic orchestral music) Listen, uh, I apologize if I was a little short with you earlier, I have a lot of things on my mind. - You got it. - Can I ask you a question? - Yeah. - Does any of this affect you even a little bit? - Your job is to deal with the people, and my job is to figure out why it happened. Okay? - Okay. (peaceful music) At least you got to see the sunset today. - It's not what you think. I'm here to solve a problem and when the sun sets, sometimes the winds can change. It's a crucial time to study the weather, okay? - Well, they're still pretty nice to look at. Don't you think? - We've all worked together at one time or another. Will's worked with me for years. - Yeah, well, he could do with a little less attitude, if you ask me. - Will? - Mm-hm. - No. Well, if he's provoked. But he's the best man I've got. He's compassionate and he works his butt off. If only he could stay a little focused on his personal life, he'd be okay. Is that a wedding band? - Yeah. My husband Jim died a couple of years ago. - Oh, Jamie. I'm so sorry. (somber orchestral music) (thunder claps) Are we gonna get another storm? - Yeah, a big one in a couple of days. I'm surprised there wasn't any rain or hail with that tornado. - How'd you become a storm chaser, Jamie? Seems like such a strange occupation for a woman. - I fell in love with my meteorology professor. - Ah. - I followed Jim into storm chasing. (playful orchestral music) - Hey, Wallace. Look, we gotta do something with this database. It's really gonna slow the approvals coming from Washington. - Oh, we're working on it. By the way, I just had supper with our resident weather expert. How's it going out there with her? - That's right, I forgot to thank you for sticking me with that little ball of attitude. - (chuckles) Funny, she said the same thing about you. - Really? - Mm-hm. - Well, I wasn't the one climbing out of the truck at 50 miles an hour. - Oh, you were that charming? By the way, I've never seen you without your shirt on. Hubba hubba. (thunder claps) (suspenseful orchestral music) (thunder rumbles) (thunder claps) - Jim! (gasps) - Wallace said you might need a backup power supply. - Put it by the backpack. I thought you were supposed to be here at noon? - You're welcome. Look at that. - My computer at home analyses the field data I gather and then simulates the storm's origin and development. - [Will] So what's it telling you? - There should have been more rain. Moisture's usually present when a storm spawns a tornado. But this is so weird. That storm wasn't powerful enough to become tornadic. Dew points, precipitation, wind sheer. Everything's off. It's like the weather's gone haywire. You know, I wonder if that storm couldn't have been environmentally influenced. - Environmentally influenced? Do you really think that's possible? - Well, storm research is also new and speculative. You know, there's a lot we don't know. It's kinda like analyzing sculpture. Every shape says something to you, but then, every time you look at it, you see something different. - Funny, I didn't see you as a sensitive artist type. I saw you more as like the sexy librarian-- - I'm not interested. - I'm just tryin' to be friendly. - (sighs) Look, Casanova, let's get something straight. I'm not here to make friends. - Oh, I don't think you have to worry about that. - Why don't you just go pick up on somebody else? I don't need a pal, you got it? - No, you need a whole lot more than that. - Hey! What does that mean? - Okay, since you ask. I'll be happy to tell you. - Please do. - Well, the way I see it, you've got it all. Repression, regression, anger, with a dash of denial. - Hoo-hoo-hoo! - Essentially, you're a miserable human being. - Oh, really? Well, let me tell you something. I am not depressed, I am not repressed, I am not angry, and I certainly am not in denial. It's guys like you that make me miserable. Let's go. - Fine, I'll be happy to drop you off anywhere you wanna go. - I wanna go back to the Doppler radar, I wanna know why someone would need weather information out here. Pick me up in a couple of hours, okay? (suspenseful orchestral music) Morning, sir. How are you today? I'm Jamie Marshall with the Department-- - This is a restricted area, ma'am. You're gonna have to leave, immediately. - Look, I'm working with FEMA in Laporte, investigating the tornado, and I was wondering if could speak to somebody here about, hey, get your hands off of me. Since when does the Department of Energy strong arm people? - Since now, I guess. - Well, gee, aren't you friendly? (thunder claps) (suspenseful orchestral music) (electrical box pops) (fence clinks) (dramatic orchestral music) - This is Unit Five, we have visual on the intruder. We're headed up toward the main gate. - Let go of me! - Jamie, are you alright? - Yes. - [Security Officer] And who are you supposed to be? - Will Stanton, FEMA, what's the problem here? - For starters, trespassing and destruction of government property. - Listen up. This facility is within the jurisdiction of a Federally declared disaster area. As a FEMA officer, I'm declaring civilian officer authority under article 5.3 of the civilian code. Now, I'm required to file a report. If you give a written account of this incident to FEMA within five business days, until then, this woman is in my custody. Thank you very much, gentlemen, have a nice day. - Score one for bureaucracy. - Get in the car. (Jamie pants) (suspenseful orchestral music) What were you thinkin'? I can't believe you broke into that place. - In case you're interested, that place back there is called Pine Feather. It's a Department of Energy facility. Looks like they're testing some kinda rockets. Who in their right mind would build a launch facility out in the middle of a mountain range? - I have no idea, all I know is we're gonna be late. - For what? - For church. Wallace is doing a memorial service for the victims killed in the storm. - I'm not going. - What? Why not? - 'Cause I didn't know any of 'em. - I didn't know 'em either, but it isn't for us. - Look, get off my case, will you? I just wanna do my job, that's it, okay? - So terrorizing the world's just a hobby with you, huh? - Oh, that's very witty. (suspenseful orchestral music) (thunder claps) Pull over. - What? - Pull the car over. - What are you doing now? Where are you goin'? Unbelievable. (thunder claps) - They clear cut all of this. I'm just gonna get a few readings, okay? - Hey, um, call me crazy, but isn't it a bad idea to be standing in a wide-open space during a lightning storm? - Sheet lightning giving you the willies? Don't worry, it'll stay up in the clouds. - You're sure about that, huh? - Listen, if you wanna experience some real lightning, I could always send up some sounding rockets. - I'll be alright. (thunder claps) (whooshing) Jamie, watch out! (explosions boom) (dramatic orchestral music) (whooshing) (explosions boom) - Ball lightning. More men have been president than have seen that. I've waited my whole life to see this. (sweeping orchestral music) - [Man] Thank you very much, we appreciate it. - I'll be right back. (woman sobs) - Oh, nice of you to show up. I'm sure it was unavoidable, right? - Wallace, I am so sorry, I'll make it up to you, alright? - It's not for me, Will. You know I always want all of my troops at these things. The bond between those who need and us has to develop in community situations. These people have to heal. - I know, I know. - Okay, what happened? - If I told ya, I don't think you'd believe me. - Probably not. (melancholic orchestral music) - She's not happy, is she? - No. You know, the disaster victims, they need to feel that we're part of their community for them to open up and deal with the trauma. That's all she's concerned about. - How'd you come into her fold anyhow? - Well, we worked together in Los Angeles after the Northwich quake. I really liked her, so I stayed on her team. - I don't know how you do it, traveling from place to place. - My family moved around a lot when I was a kid. I guess I just got used to it. - Wow, would you look at this? The lightning got your car. - So, if you're hungry, maybe you'd like to get some dinner? - Listen, you don't have to play the dinner game with me. It's just... (sighs) - What? - Look, don't take it personal, okay? - Don't take it personally? - I have a lot of work to do. It happened, it's over. Just forget about it, okay? - I'm tellin' you the truth, Smitty. - Are you sure a ball of lightning didn't hit you in the head? - Yes, I'm sure, look, I've gotta check my messages. Grab me a beer, alright? Thanks. (upbeat pop music) Thanks. - Did I miss something, but, was it you that said Jamie was "one big pain in the butt?" - I know what I said, Smitty, but, I've never met a woman like this before. (Smitty chuckles) - Who would have thought, you and lady science? So how long is this gonna last? - According to her, not too long. It happened, it's over, and that's it. - Really? (chuckles) Seems like she's lettin' you off easy. What about Melanie? You know, she left a few messages at the FEMA Center today. - I know, she called here, too. What do you think I should do, Smitty? - [Smitty] Are you a nurse? I've got a pain, right there. - Thanks for your help. (telephone rings) (peaceful orchestral music) (telephone rings) (telephone bleeps) - [Melanie] Hi, Will, it's Melanie. (sighs) I miss you, call me. (ethereal orchestral music) (melancholic orchestral music) - Oh, I miss you. You better secure these tents. There's a big storm coming through. - Good morning, Will, how are you? Well, I'm doing fine, Jamie, thank you for asking. Did you sleep well? Well, yes I did, and you? - Excuse me, Wallace, do you have a minute? Well, last night, you know... Look, I don't want you to be upset with Will. It was all my fault, really. - Well, it was a very special night and I'm sorry you missed it. (Jamie chuckles) - You know, Will isn't as bad as I thought at first. (chuckles) It's, um... It's been a while since I've thought about men since, you know, Jim... But, Will-- - I like Will. He's a good guy. But like most FEMA workers, he's always looking to be on the move, you know what I mean? Just keep that in mind. - Okay. Listen, do you have an extra computer terminal I might use for a bit? - Oh, just help yourself. - Thanks. (suspenseful orchestral music) Hey. - Hey. - Will, I need to get back up into those mountains. I did some research on Pine Feather. They built it about a year and a half ago, and it's been operational for nine months. And guess what? They're testing satellite launch applications. - Hm. Well, I'm done with my damage reports, Jamie. I really don't have any need to go back out to Pine Feather. - I'm not talkin' about Pine Feather, I'm talkin' about the mountain where the ball lightning was. - Do you think that's such a good idea? You know what happened the last time we were out there. - I know you might have a hard time believing this, Will, but it has nothing to do with you. - When do you need to go? - Sunset. - Alright. Depends. - Depends on what? - What you're willing to do for it. (playful orchestral music) (Jamie chuckles) - You know, I told him. I knew you were good for somethin' around here. - Uh, Jamie? - Yeah? - [Will] I think that one's done. - [Jamie] Sorry. - Well, we may finally have found your weakness. - Last night, um... I know I sounded a little harsh and... (sighs) I know we both have a lot of work to do and, well, I know I don't need the complications. - You don't have to sell me on the concept. You might wanna flip that one there. (Smitty whistles jauntily) - You been doing this a long time, Smitty? - Yeah, it's tough to leave this business, once you get a taste of it. (Jamie chuckles) We're all pretty much roamers around here. My dad was in the army, he kept moving us around. Travel gets in your blood. - [Jamie] So what's Will's story? - Will? His family were farmers, and they lost their farm in a flood. His mom was killed. And they lost the land they plowed for generations. I think he was 12. - That's terrible. - Yeah, I know it pretty much beat up his dad. He couldn't hold onto a job anymore, kept moving the kids around. I guess the nomad life stayed with Will. Yeah, pal of mine, look who's here. - Melanie? What's she doin' here? Oh-oh, the boys from Pine Feather. (dramatic orchestral music) Oh-oh. Jamie, do you wanna get back out to Fox Bow? - Now? - Let's go. - Okay. Wait, let me get my stuff. - Come on, come on, come on! - Okay! What's the hurry? (knocks) - Jamie sent you an email. She wants her SSV. - We ought to give her one for Christmas. - She's reporting strange weather phenomena and demanded a watch group be on standby. - Figures, anything else? - Yeah. She did a Department of Energy search on the internet, and apparently used your clearance code for secure access. - Why am I even surprised by her anymore? - No, the only reason I know is because your log number appeared on my clearance report. She accessed off a terminal in Laporte. She searched Pine Feather. Should I pull her? - No. First, let's see what she's chasing. (thunder rumbles) - Okay. Here, Smitty, can you put that there for me? Thanks. - What is this place? - Pine Feather is scheduled to expand their facility. They're gonna clear out another 5,000 acres. Can you hold that? It's so strange, I think they've somehow affected the electromagnetic field here. - Where are you going? - I'm just gonna go stand over here. - [Smitty] You guys are making me nervous. What are you doing? - Running a lightning test. I'm gonna fire this rocket up in the air with a copper line attached, and hopefully it'll draw an ion charge. - You're gonna pull down a lightning bolt? - Mm-hm. - Yeah, right. She's gonna pull down a lightning bolt. (chuckles) This I gotta see. - I'll watch from here, Smitty. - Okay. (rocket hisses) - Well, that was impressive. (thunder rumbles) Ben Franklin did this in a storm, not just a cloudy sky. - I can assure you, Smitty, there is enough electricity up in these clouds to power all of Manhattan. - Okay. Power Manhattan. - Here, you try it. - You're giving me this? Cool, alright. Five, four, three, two, one. (rocket hisses) (thunder claps) - Yeah! Yes! (lightning zaps) (dramatic orchestral music) (laughs) Did you see that? There was a second strike! - Watch yourself, Smitty. This is where she really goes nuts. - She made lightning, she made lightning. - Okay, Will, your turn. - Do I have to? - Yes, go on, hurry! Come on! - Okay, Smitty, give me a countdown. - Five, four, three, two, one. (rocket hisses) (lightning zaps) (thunder claps) - Yeah, woo-hoo! Multiple strikes! We've got multiple strikes! (laughs) What are you all doin' down there? - You've got a crazy way of getting your kicks. - No, you don't understand, that never happens. This sky is like a huge electrical gain board. - Well, that one came outta nowhere. - I knew it, the residue on the leaves is nitrogen oxide. - Obviously something we shouldn't be finding here, right? - No. It comes from burning liquid hydrogen at high temperatures. - Liquid hydrogen? - Rocket fuel. It must be coming from the testing at Pine Feather. Will, I need my other bag out of the truck. - [Will] Right. - So, you went to school, studied the Earth sciences, and got your PhD? - No, just married one. - That would be better than grad school. Wow, it's really pickin' up. (strong wind blows) What's goin' on out here? - Here's the bag, where do you want it? - Over there! Okay, you clear cut all the trees, you mix rocket fuel with electrical fields... That's it, this is ground zero! That's what's creating the instability. It then creates the updraft which spawns a tornado. How can I prove that? Everyone's gonna think I'm nuts. Listen, if I can prove that Pine Feather has affected weather on a local scale, then maybe perhaps I could prove that industry's affected weather patterns on a global scale. (explosion booms) - Oh, man. (fire crackles) (thunder claps) - Jim, do you read me? (explosion booms) - Jamie! Jamie! - Jim. Jim! - Oh my god. - [Will] Jamie, are you alright, are you alright? - They never had a chance. - It's all my fault, I should have called. I should have called the FAA. (pants) (sighs) Hey. - How are you feelin'? - Fine. Sorry. - Nothin' to be sorry about. Listen, I made some coffee, care for some? - Sure. - Here you go. - Thanks. Mm, it's good. I used to love the Moon. (chuckles) When I was a kid, I used to sneak out on the roof to watch it. That's when I became obsessed with the sky. - Who's, um... Who's Jim? - My husband. (chuckles) He taught me everything I know. He was my entire world. (chuckles) He, um... He was killed in a chase. - I'm sorry, Jamie. (Jamie sighs) (Jamie giggles) - I used to think that I had this schoolgirl crush on him 'cause he was my teacher. But, um, on our first date, he took me on a picnic, underneath the moonlight. And I knew right then and there he was the love of my life. - How'd it happen? - A silent storm. Storms that don't wait, you know what they're about. Kinda like here. (giggles) Jim used to say that silent storms were a lot like love. They'd sneak up and hit you when you were lulled. (melancholic orchestral music) (chuckles) (telephone rings) - Stanton. - Will! - Yeah, Wallace? - [Wallace] What exactly are you trying to pull? - What? - You know what! Don't play games with me, you think I'm some sort of a fool! - No, Wallace-- - Don't "Wallace" me! I don't wanna hear any of your excuses. Will, do you understand that I am very, very upset! - You don't have to yell. - You bet I have to yell! - No, you're absolutely right. - [Wallace] Now meet me at the office right away. - Okay, I'll be there in a few minutes. - Okay. - Right. - [Wallace] Okay. (Will sighs) (telephone keypad bleeps) - Hello, Smitty here. - Smitty, it's Will. Listen, do me favor, meet me in front of the FEMA Center in a few minutes, alright? I need you to back me up with Wallace. - [Smitty] Sure, whatever you need, I'll be there. - Right. - I've got the Department of Energy in a tizzy over a security breach, which I assume was Jamie, aided and abetted by a security officer from FEMA, which I assume is you! And what is a civilian officer authority? - Uh, quick thinking? - You know I was warned about her and if you can't keep her under control, I'm gonna get the center to send somebody who can. - Wallace, you didn't see what I saw today. I mean, ask Smitty what she did. - She made lightning. - I don't care if she parted the Red Sea. I'm not having her jeopardize our operation! - Wallace, three more people got added to the casualty list because of the freaky weather around here. She's just trying to figure out what's going on. I think we need to let her do her job so that hopefully we can keep that list from growing. - Alright, alright, what exactly is she doing out there? - I don't know, but Smitty knows. - Look, I just, I don't... I just, keep your eye on her, okay? (computer bleeps) - Denied? I need that van. (melancholic piano music) (suspenseful orchestral music) That's it. I knew it. Yes! (peaceful orchestral music) (knocks) Boo. (giggles) Come on, what are you, 42? Huh? Oh, a 44! - Jamie? - Good morning. How'd you sleep? 32, what's your inseam? - 35? - Great, I'll see you at nine. Okay? - What are you doing? - [Jamie] Ordering you a suit. - I can explain! Alright, look. The woman that you saw in the room... It's, it's not what you think. - That's really original. - Well, you're the one that said what happened between us was no big deal. - Yes, I did. But I wouldn't have let it happen, if I had known you were that kind of a guy. - What? What kinda guy? I mean, if I remember correctly, you're the one that started it, not me, you're the weather sex junkie. - Oh, yeah, well you put up a real big fight, didn't you? - What do you think I was-- - I don't even wanna talk about it anymore, okay? - Fine. I'll just drive. - Good. That's all you're good for anyway. - So, uh, you gonna tell me where we're goin'? - Center for Severe Storms Research. - What? Why? - My department is facing massive budget cuts and my bosses won't release the equipment I need. So I am going to go to them, okay? - Jamie, that's a 10-hour drive. - So, have you got a date? (Will sighs) (warm orchestral music) I think I've finally figured you out. - Oh, you have, have you? - Uh-huh. - Thought you didn't wanna talk about this anymore? - I think you got from woman to woman and place to place and FEMA just gives you an excuse to do that, am I right? - Alright, maybe that's partially true, but it has nothing to do with this. Look, I'll admit Melanie and I have been together before, but not last night. - She was in your bed. - Well, what else was I supposed to do with her, okay? She's not exactly the camping type. - The sofa would have done. - Nothing happened. I told her it was over, she accepted it, she was gonna leave this morning. - Listen, don't worry about it, soon I'll be gone and then you can carry on with your stupid little social life absolutely unfettered, okay? - Fine. - At least that fits. - Yours looks a little tight. - Hello, Smitty here. - Smitty, it's Will. - [Smitty] Will? Where are you? - Oklahoma. - [Smitty] Will, what are you doing in Oklahoma? - Well, I've been kidnapped. Look, tell Wallace I'm gonna be with Jamie all day, alright? I'll explain everything when I get back. - [Smitty] Okay, say hi to Xena the Weather Princess. - Alright, bye. Can we call a truce, at least until all this is over? - Okay. - By the way, I think you look pretty good in that dress. - Well, thank you. - So, you think you've figured out what happened at Laporte? - I have a theory. But I need to get out there in an SSV to prove it. You wanna hear it? - Mm-hm. - Okay. Excuse me. These are the mountains. And foothills. Valley. And there's Laporte. Now, before, the storms used to come over the mountains. No real big great effect, right? So, what's changed? - Pine Feather? - You got it. - Okay. Now, I'm obviously no weather expert, but didn't you say that these supercell thunderstorms are massive? - Mm, huge, they can be hundreds of miles. - Alright, so how's changing a couple of square miles of landscape by Pine Feather gonna affect them? - Watch. Imagine this is a thunderstorm. - Mm-hm. - Okay? I'm gonna shake it up. See how a funnel's forming? - Ah! - There's this theory that if you have a prevailing wind and it hits a strong crosswinds or an object, it can turn it back in on itself. Now, I think that with the deforestation of the area, along with the power lines and the chemicals, it somehow created the perfect environment for this to happen. - Environmental influence. So, your bosses know you're comin', right? - No. - No? You know, they warned Wallace about you. - They did? - Mm-hm. What's the story behind that? - They think I have an attitude problem. I'm too intense for the volunteers. - What do you do to the volunteers? - Storm chasing is very dangerous. They need to know what they're doing out there. People die doing it, even the experts. - So, that's it. I've been trying to figure you out since the first day I set eyes on you. Now... Now it all makes sense. It's Jim. Jim dies, you don't know who to strike out at, so you strike out at everyone. You chase storms because you think if you figure them out, then you'll understand what happened. Well, Jamie... There's nothing to understand. Jim's death... Jim's death will never be alright. Until you realize that your world with Jim is over, but your life isn't, you'll never be able to move on. (Jamie gasps) (jaunty classical music) (background chatter) - None of which would be possible, of course, without the equipment and staff we have invested here. - Excuse me. - Follow me. - Frank. - What? - We have a problem. - What? - Jamie's here. - Jamie, where are you going? - I just need to check something. Hey. Thanks. You know when you said that nothing happened with Melanie? I really did believe you. - You did? - I did. - Jamie, come on, let's go. - It's gonna be much worse than I thought. Okay, let's go. - [Frank] Jamie, what are you doing here? - The problems in Laporte are being created by Pine Feather. They need to shut down that operation immediately. Laporte's weather has shifted because of the building and operating of that place. It's what's creating the massive wind sheer. - Jamie, that is a NASA, Defense and Energy joint project. When launches are scrubbed, NASA can't just simply restart. They lose their launch windows. Pine Feather is developing a quick start system that will retake it right away, it'll save billions of dollars. - They're creating instability. Airborne activants from the launch pad along with the landscape changes and the electrical fields is fueling a tornado. Look, you yourself said there hasn't been a tornado there in the last 100 years, well, there could be one within the next few hours when the next storm hits. I need to get out there and I need that SSV. - No way, we're already a million in the hole because of the last two you trashed, and tonight, we're having to beg just to keep the budget from being slashed again. - It's got to wait. - No, it can't wait. - Jamie, go sit tight, we'll debate your theories later. - No, we're not gonna debate it, Frank! They're creating silent storms. - She's totally out of control, Frank. - You know, she does have her moments, but she's calculated all this stuff, the mezzanines and the winds and the... - Who are you? - Oh, Will Stanton, sir. FEMA. Hi, hi. You know, if I were you guys, I'd believe her. Because of these huge power grid things and the winds, coming in laterally and warming up and rising, the rocket fuel... Give me your glass and I'll show you exactly... I'll go wait with Jamie. Nice talking to you guys. - She's totally lost it, I mean, she is nuts. When she said she had seen ball lightning. - Ball lightning? - Yeah. In her email she said she had witnessed ball lightning showers, I mean, can you believe that? We should have pulled her then. - Ball lightning. - Your friends are a barrel of laughs. - I need you to get hold of Smitty. Tell him there's another storm coming that's gonna make the last one look like a summer breeze, okay? Jamie Marshall, CSSR. - Smitty, it's Will, listen. We've got a problem, it's heading right for you. I need you to implement a full weather alert scramble. - A tornado watch issued for Western Colorado through to the Laporte basin. - All I'm telling you is that this is a big one. - Weather will be severe for the next six to 12 hours, okay? - Smitty, please? - Right. Thank you. - Thank you. - Well? - Smitty's taking care of it. - Great, let's go. - Jamie, I don't think they want you goin' anywhere. Do you ever listen to anything anyone ever tells you? - The SSV is the prize of the program, sir. Fully operational, mobile weather station. The SSV has provided us with the most sophisticated research to date and we're very, very proud of our new Model 3 SSV. (playful orchestral music) - You know, in most states they still consider this grand theft, huh? - Yep. - I can't believe we stole one of their vans. So, are your bosses coming after us? - I sure hope so. Let's go. - If I know her, she's headed right into that storm! - You stay south of the storm and head for Laporte. - She won't get far! (thunder rumbles and claps) - (sighs) This storm's a monster. It's just gathering strength. (thunder claps) - It's starting to rain pretty hard! - Okay, let's see where we are here. Collapsing overshooting top. Pull over! It's a collapsing overshooting top. (thunder rumbles) - [Will] Collapsing overshooting what? - Pull over, now! Get in the back! Hurry! You got it? - I think so. - Okay, hold on. (thunder claps) - What's going on? - We're right underneath the supercell dome. (dramatic orchestral music) (thunder claps) (thunder claps) Oh, wow, that was great, wasn't it? - Yeah. (Jamie laughs) Wow, that came and went. Never been through anything like that before. - Welcome to my world. - You know, uh... I'm beginning to think I'm getting kind of attached to this world. (Jamie chuckles) - Yeah? - Yeah. (thunder rumbles) (strong wind blows) (suspenseful orchestral music) (thunder claps) (thunder claps) (suspenseful orchestral music) Good job, Smitty! - Thanks. - Jamie. - It's about time you got here. - The commerce secretary isn't happy. Do you know what this little stunt could do? - Yeah, well, you wouldn't listen to me. You see this storm? You asked me to go out and find something, so I did. - I know, I should have told you the truth years ago. Jim and I were in commerce together when Pine Feather was first proposed. He did an environmental impact analysis on this site, saying all this could happen. - You're saying you knew about this stuff? - No, we didn't know, it was just a prediction. Jim got fired over this, I had to fight to get him back on staff when the research center was opened. I believed in Jim, and I believe you're about to prove him right. And I'm not gonna stop you. - Now, if you'll excuse me, I've gotta go find a tornado before it finds us. You ready for some action? - Hold on, hold on, wait. This is a liability release indemnifying the Center for Severe Storm Research for anything that might happen to you out there. - Oh, wow, this is a twist. A volunteer that wants to go with you. (chuckles) - Come on, let's go. (dramatic orchestral music) (thunder claps and rumbles) - [Reporter] Severe thunderstorm and tornado watches are currently in effect for Well County. Please be prepared to seek shelter in the event that a tornado warning is issued. - We're gonna need open phone lines, online computer terminals and get VCRs on those, I want backup on everything we get from Jamie and the SSV. (suspenseful orchestral music) (thunder claps) - Okay. Okay, we've got heavy electrical fields, but the rain still hasn't hit yet. Tail cloud, fracture Denville. I knew it would start here. - Supercell? - Very good. Hopefully it'll spawn a mesocyclone. - It looks like it's heading east. - No, northeast. That's not bad for a rookie, though. Come on, it's all ours now. (storm rumbles) Base, this is Unit Three, we have a visual confirmation of a supercell. - Copy that, SSV. - We're northeast, approximately seven miles from it. There's a cumulative form anvil at the rear that we're following, it looks like the worst will swing past Laporte, but it might hit near Wellington and maybe back towards Fox Bow, over. I'm transmitting, you got it? - Jamie, we are receiving your video feed. That is affirmative, we are receiving it, Jamie. - Jamie, get the profiler going. I want a lifted index right away. - Okay. Lifted index is minus-10. There's a good chance we'll get to see a mesocyclone today. - Wonderful. - Come on, darling. Show me what you've got. Low level backing winds. That's it. Hey, that's it! - That's what? - Frank, Jim always theorized a situation like this could create multiple tornadoes, but everybody laughed at him because they said it wasn't found in nature, but it is here because of the operation of Pine Feather! We could have two or three simultaneous tornadoes. Okay, we've got a hook echo. Strong inflow on the rear plank. There's gotta be a tornado here somewhere. There, there he is, right there. - Look at that, is that a big one? - F4, F5. - How high does the scale go? - Five. - I was afraid you were gonna say that. (storm siren rings) - Base, this is Unit Three. We have an F4, possible F5, 15 miles north of Laporte heading east. I'm turning the camera around so you can take a look. - [Wallace] Oh, no. (gasps) - Wow. - She did it. She found it. (dramatic orchestral music) - Oh-oh. - Oh-oh? What now? - Look there. - Are they allowed to do that? - It's called a multiple vortex, and it can do whatever it wants. But that's not the big problem, those are. - [Will] Oh, great, like we don't have enough problems. (storm siren rings) - Uh, guys? Guys. - Laporte, we've got a problem, we've got six. I repeat, six touchdowns. That's two heading east, two traveling northeast, and two southwest. - They have no way out. The speed of those things will cut off all their routes. - Oh my god. - Jamie, you've gotta get out of there. - I'm doing the best I can, Frank. Okay, look, the ones on the left, don't worry about. The ones on the right, they're a little bit stickier. But this one, right there. That's definitely a problem. - Oh, god. (thunder rumbles) (lightning zaps) - Don't worry, the emergency generators will backup the equipment! (lightning zaps) (explosion roars) (dramatic orchestral music) - We're never gonna outrun it! - Okay, any suggestions how we're gonna get outta here? - We're not! - What? - There. Get us there now. Move it! - You don't think I'm goin' as fast as I can? - Okay, it's now or never. Stop. - What are you doin'? - Securing the van. Hopefully it'll hold long enough so Frank can get some footage. - [Smitty] What are they doing? - [Frank] It's the only chance they've got. - That's it, let's go! (strong wind blows) (lightning zaps) (Will groans) (glass smashes) (glass smashes) (Will groans) It's over! - No, it's gonna turn around. We're in the eye. Hold on! (strong wind blows) (groans) (strong wind roars) - Now I know why they make you sign those release forms. (Jamie coughs) You know somethin'? I definitely prefer the ball lightning. - Me, too. (laughs) (peaceful orchestral music) (giggles) (playful orchestral music) (horn honks) - Are you guys alright? - Fine. - Well, how was it? - Well, Smitty, it was kinda like love. You're sitting there and you're minding your own business, when all of a sudden, out of nowhere it hits you. And then you're in the middle of it, and there's a whole lot of thrashing around, and you kinda just hang on for dear life. And then, it's calm. And you know your life has changed forever. - That's good. - Hey, you guys, look, I'm really sorry about the SSV. - We got the most spectacular weather footage and data ever recorded, ever. - You earned your stripe today. Jim was one in a million, and Jamie, you make two. - Thanks. Remember I told you I just wanna finish what he started? Well, I did it. - Hey. Can I borrow her for a second? Jamie, you know after everything we've been through, I think it's time we both take a vacation. - Yeah, where you thinkin'? - How would you feel about a warm, sun-soaked beach in Tahiti? - What do you think about a cold, rain-soaked chase in Texas? (moody orchestral music) (dramatic orchestral music)
