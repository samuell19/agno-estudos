Now, remember what you've been taught. Bring him home with love. Have a safe journey, my child. Yes, his time has come. - Arrivederci. - Bonne chance, ma belle. Allons. Good luck, kid. Sayonara. Albert, just wait a minute... I think I broke my shoe. Why are you always stalling? Come on, let's move it. - I... don't talk to me in that tone of voice. - Hup, 2, 3. - Ohh. Just a little, thank you... now, what it comes down to grace, is basics. If your stepson applies himself, he can climb that success ladder just as quickly as I did. See, there is no stopping a man who is determined. - Isn't that right, Ben? - Oh, right. Ed you're so right. - Whoo! Hi there, Patty. - Hi, Patty. - Hi. - Oh, Patty, Patty, oh, I'm so happy for you and... I'm sorry. - Jim. - Oh, yes. Jim. Have you set the date yet? - Yes, it looks like... - Look at this girl. Such a face. I feel horrible about this foul weather ruining your engagement party. Oh, well, it just brings us all closer together, don't you think? Will you excuse me? I seem to have lost my fiancé. Oh, Patty, get a good hold on that one. He's quite a catch. Yes. I'd be afraid someone would steal him away. I'd like to see 'em try. Ah! - Hi... oh, thank you. - Congratulations. From what my daughter tells me, your son has the makings of a great salesman. Now, that is long-term security for the boy, not this musician stuff. Ah, here she comes, daddy's little star. Oh, have I showed you the artwork for our new campaign? Wait till you see this... this is just something. - Daddy. - Oh, look at her. - Ohh. Here, hold this up, Ben, so everybody can see my little, ethereal beauty. So damn proud. First, she becomes the face for our new cosmetic line, and then my one and my only one - gonna become a bride. - Mm. Your boy better treat my little Princess right, Ben... or else. - It's my little pattycat here. - Ok, enough. Have you seen Jim? I can't seem to find him anywhere. Sure, last time I saw him, old al cirimele was chewing his ear off in the kitchen. Al is the best sales rep we've got, and Jim is gonna be on his team. Will you all excuse me, please? Hello, Patricia. - Mr. Winston, sir. - Aldridge, what are you doing here? I know this isn't the time to talk business, sir, but gleason said you did wanna know the marketing results of the ethereal beauty line. Oh, yes, I certainly do. Well... Pretty bad... Sir. Honey. In case no one told you, the party has moved inside due to the bad weather. That's funny. Nobody said a word to me. - You think I should be offended? - This is embarrassing. Everybody is gonna think that I'm marrying a man who doesn't have enough sense to come in out of the rain. Maybe everybody doesn't know what they're missing. This is called a romantic interlude. Come out and interlude with me? Um. - You're making me mad... I'm going in. - No, wait! Sanders on first base. Looks like he's going for second, and there he goes! Sanders has stolen second base. And Sanders looks like he's gonna go for third, but wait. The play is to third base. It looks bad for Sanders. It's a pickle. He's caught between second and third base. There's the base, there's the toss, and Sanders is safe at third. - Are you coming in or not? - Is Sanders coming in or not? That seems to be the question of the evening. There's the pitch. It's a perfect bunt down the first-base line. His fans are cheering him in: "Go! Go! Go!" They're going crazy. They're on their feet. They're at the window. Uh! Heh... hi, um... we'll be in in one second, okay? I hope you have some way of explaining this to them, because I don't. We could tell them I start spring training tomorrow. No. You okay? You still have that headache? - No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine. - Come on, slugger. I'll dry you off and get you some more aspirin, but, Jim... - I know. I know. I know. - What? - No more fun tonight. - Right. Come on, honey. Ahh! All right, listen up, you scum! Shut off that crap! - Oh! - Oh! - Ha! Smooth move, man. - All right. You've got something we want. - If we get it, nobody gets hurt. - What the hell is this? You want a free demonstration? All right! We want a hostage! Take that guy! Get him! - Oh, dear god! - Whoo! - Whoo! Whoo! - Ahh! - All right... - Shut up, or I'll grease your friends here! Come on. Come here. You want to see your friend alive again, cooperate when we call. Ben, do something. Nobody move, nobody gets hurt. - I change my mind. Catch! - Ahh! Pin! - Let's get the hell out of here! - What'd you do? Don't ask... just go, go, go! - Ahh! - It's all right, it's all right, don't panic. I'll get it. It's probably them. - Yes? - Good evening, sir. Can you tell me what sound a rubber grenade makes? Sorry... time's up. The correct answer is... Ow! Ha ha ha! Whoo! Ooh! Ha ha hal come on, Georgie, go! Beautiful! Jerks - hey! - This is the worst thing you ever done, George! The worst? Why, I oughta... For a nonprofit scam, this was all-time. All-time? Do you have any idea what you've done? He's hot! He's hot! Cool him off! Cool him off! - Firel - Just wait till you see the real party - we have going back at casa hymie. - No! - Yes. - No, not at my place, not the party ninjas. - It's your bachelor party. - Surprise! Yeah, come on, Sanders. How's about a little appreciation up here? - I'll give you some appreciation, George. - Hey! Hey! Somebody! Anybody! Help! Miss? Miss? Hey, huh? Oh, come on. A phone, phone, phone. Where's the phone? 911, 911, 911. Great. Wow. Hi. Oh, I'm sorry, I... I didn't mean to be too... Can I get you something to...? How about something for your...? Oh, boy... uh, maybe I should... - Oh! - Ahh! Oh, it's broken. Well, don't worry. We'll get somebody to look at it. I promise, I'll take care of everything... I'll just call a doctor or a... Veterinarian... oh, no, no. No, I'm sorry... I mean, I'm... Married... um, I mean, not married, I... I... I'm engaged, which is, you know, it's, uh, just as bad... I mean, it's... I'm... I'm... I'm dreaming. I mean, I must be dreaming... if I'm dreaming, then there's nothing to feel guilty about, right? So, uh, go ahead. Knock yourself out. Coming... ugh! I don't believe this. I know... I know I overslept. I hope you had pleasant dreams. - Well, as a matter of fact... - Jim, this isn't funny. Daddy is furious over last night. Honey, I thought I explained everything when I called. Yeah, you also said that you would be over first thing in the morning - with an apology for him. - You're absolutely right... I'm sorry. - Sorry. - All right, well, I should at least call him - and tell him that you... - Uh, no, no, no. Actually, the place is a little messy from last night. Actually, uh, more than a bit... I don't think you want to see this. Okay... all right, so, we'll see you in half an hour. - Okay. - Okay, and, Jim, please, don't be late. There's some sort of problem going on at the company, and daddy is in a real poo-poo mood. - Okay, I promise... I'll hurry. - Okay. All right. Thanks, guys. Move it, jerks! You guys, uh... you guys don't think she was just a tad angry with us, do you? - Nah. - Nah. Oh, my god. You're real. Ouch. Jim! This is your wake-up call. - Continental breakfast. - Listen, um... - Jim! - Wait a minute, uh... - Stay there, stay there... no, no, no. - Jimbob! - Don't move... don't go anywhere. - Come on, Sanders! Hide. Hide, okay? Hide. Just hide. - Hide. - Hey, open the door! Open up... how! Jimbob! Come on, Sanders! Maybe he's on the throne. - Hi... hi. - Hi. - Hey. - What's going on? - You tell us. - I was just leaving. I'm gonna go meet up with Patty. - Yeah, we just saw her. - Great gal. Not even remotely upset about last night. Oh, yeah? Terrific... well, listen, guys, I'm in a bit of a hurry, so do me a favor. - Why don't you walk me out, okay? Come on. - Well, we came over to help you clean up. Is this open? - No, no... that's all right, I got everything, anyway. Oh, ok, well, gee, we really wanted to help you, Jim. - Maybe we can come back later! - No! No! Wait, guys! - Where is it? - Where's what? - I don't know. - What? - Holmes, the bedroom. - Bravo, Watson... the game's afoot! - I don't get it. - Neither do I. I mean... I mean, what did you jerks expect to find, huh? You think that, um...? Ha! Yes! - No, no, no... it's not what you think it is, George. Welcome home. - George, it's really, really important that you listen to me right now, okay? Our little stud soufflé went on a love frenzy - last night. - It's not what you... will you stop it? George, please, it's really important you listen to me right now, okay? You're about to see something that is simply gonna amaze you. - We know that's not Patty, right, guys? - George, please. I don't know whether I should go for the year's supply of canned ham - or what's behind curtain number 3. - Curtain number three! George, I'm begging you... would you listen to me? It's important. - Curtain number 3! - Ham! Ham! - Bob, I'm going for the curtain. - No! - Open that curtain! - No! Who is she? - I guess that's an angel. - Angel who? Ah! Just an angel. We have not got time for this. We got to get back there. We never should've left her alone. - You'll feel better after we get you something to eat. - Rex, decoy. - Big Jim, eat, eat! You need all your strength for the scam that... - Hi. - So, how you doing? - Fine... yeah. - Yeah? I'm excited, guys. This doesn't happen every day. - This is big, Don. - Grab those peanut butter cookies for Rex. Now listen... what do we know about trademark and copyrights? - I'll call Wertheimer. - Wertheimer? He went to law school... the thing about this, guys, is, we have to move rapid, quick. Once that wing heals, she's gone. - I just want to make sure we don't get ripped off. - Ripped off? We own an angel, guys. - We do not own an angel. - Revenue deluxe. - Go on, go on. Motion pictures, concert appearances... I'm thinking out loud here... - Radio, record albums, television... - Yeah, yeah, yeah! Mini-series, man: "Angel, the ninth wonder of the world." I'm not gonna turn her into some kind of sideshow freak. I didn't even think about sideshows. - Jim... - Look. She's hurt, okay? She's got to be cared for... We got to find somebody... Hey, what's up? You're supposed to be on decoy. Yeah, well, she's on the phone lining up a couple of hot ones for us tonight. I can't believe I'm wasting time with you maniacs... I got to get back. I never should've left her alone in the first place... George, pay for this stuff. - If your family needs money... - No! Ever since the second grade, we've done everything you wanted to because up until now, we haven't hurt anybody. But, think about it, George... she's an angel... she doesn't belong in a circus, so if you don't want to help me, then fine, no problem. I'll take care of it myself. See you later. Okay. All right. Don't worry... all this is gonna do is make you heal faster. I'm sorry, I'm sorry... you okay? Cold, huh? Don't worry... Just wrap this around you like that. See? All better, huh? Is that better? No. No. Can't do that, see, I... Oh, no... Patty's father. No, no... I should just go over, don't you think? I thought so. Just what I need, another headache... I'll be back with Patty as soon as I can, and then we'll figure out what to do with you. You, uh... you, uh, keep warm, and don't let anybody see you. No, no, no, no... I'll be back very soon. You'll be safe here, I promise... There's nothing to worry about. Ahh! Patty... oh, listen, I was just on my way over to explain about... So, this is why you didn't want me coming in before, huh? Patty, listen, it's not what you think it is... she's not a girl, she's an angel. Oh, god, Jim. - It's true, I swear to god, it's true. - I can't believe you'd do this to me. - At least your friends were honest with me. - What did they tell you? - Obviously, the truth. - Patty, wait. You know they hate you... I mean... what? Get back inside. Go onl! Oh, man, don't break anything else. Why me? Well, this must be the place. Come on. Um. Yeeow! Okay, you stay here, okay? - Yes? - Excuse me, could I talk to you for a minute? - Go around. - It's just take a second. - Other side, son. - Okay. Yes, I'll be right back, I promise you, okay? Now, what are your sins? Now, there's no reason to be afraid. Tell me, when was your last confession? - Confession of what? - Are you a catholic, son? No... no, sir, I've never been here before. - I just didn't know where to take her. - Take who? - The angel I found. - Hmm. So anyways, so I brought her here figuring maybe you folks would know what to do with her. I can't take care of her, and I don't want to see her exploited, so what should I do? Oh, say 10 hail Marys and 8 our fathers, - and make a good act of contrition. - Wait, what do you mean? - I don't know what those things are. - Well, that's not my problem. Go in peace. - Ahh! - Ahh! Ahh! Dios mio! Santa Maria! Santa Maria! Hey, hey. Hey, come here... it's me... come on. Oh, it's okay, it's all right, everything's fine. Now, what's going on here? Oh, sir, um... This is her, see, she's the angel. Now, whatever you kids are up to, a church is no place for your pranks. - Now, you'll have to leave. - No, uh, listen. Let me take this off and show you what she really looks like. If you don't leave, I'm gonna have to call the police. But, where am I gonna take her? Try the baptists. And here she is, our contestant for the final round. Honey, I'm sure she's just one of those girls left over from that party they had. Lounging around in his blanket until 5:00 the next afternoon. - No, it is over between us. - No, don't say that! Owl - oh! Ohh! I'm sorry. Oh, honey. We're gonna keep calling Jim until we get to the bottom of this. Oh, mm. - I'm sure the tea will help those. - This always happens when I get upset. Ohh. Ben! Where's that tea? Here we are, ladies... Sorry it took so long. You'll love these shortbread cookies, Patty... I used twice the butter. Just put it down over there. Patty doesn't care at the moment about twice the butter, thanks to your son. - Have you called again? - Yes, grace, he's still not home. Patty, I know Jim would never delib... I'll never forgive him if he ruins this for us. - Honey. - Mhm? Does you daddy know about all this yet? - Mhm. - Well, what did he say? He said he was gonna tear Jim's head off - and shove it... - Maybe I'd better try Jim's place again. Ohh, aw. Come on, try it. Please? Look, don't be scared... There's nothing to be afraid of. I mean, everybody likes hamburgers, it... Look, you can't get better unless you eat something. Come on, you got to try it... You... you'll love this. Like this, watch... see? Big bite. Hmm? Uh-huh, it's good, hmm? Mm-mm-mml! It's good, tastes great. You try. Mhm, it's good, mhm. - Oh, no, no. - What is that? Hey... shh. Shh, no, no, no, no, no, wait. Look, it's just a hamburger... There's nothing to be frightened of. No, no, no, no... it's not gonna bite you. If you don't wanna... Uh, I've got to call Patty. Be right back. George, we've been down this road twice. So, where else do we look, Sherlock? - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Whoa, whoa! - Turn! - Back it up, back it up... George, it's her! Come on back, come on. Come on, pull in there... quick! Oh, wow... hello there. Remember me? Grace, if Patty's there, could I please just talk to her? That... that's not true... you just don't under... - Oh, don't give me that. If you really cared, you wouldn't be having this lewd affair. Here, these are 2-ply. Madam, your carriage awaits you on track number 7. First stop, Broadway... Second stop's along the way at Hollywood. - Right this way, come on. - Higher tax bracket... come on. Never fear, Mr. French fry is here... okay. Hey, no sign of Jim, but he's gotta be around. - Mm. - She likes them. - Right, she does. - Yeah, yeah... really? There you go... yeah, yeah. - Come on, come on. - Come on. Out of this car, into that car. Get the door... get the door, Rex. - Okay, get the door. - Give her that look... she's prime. - Give her that look... the look. - Come here. - Hey, how you doing? - Okay, forget the look, forget the look. - Make with the fries again. - Come on, you... I know how it appears, but I promise you, if you let me talk to her for two seconds, I... I know I can straighten this whole thing out. He wants to talk to you for two seconds. Okay. Drop dead! That was two seconds. Come on, come on. - Hey! - What? Ahh! - What are you trying to do? - Well, I'm trying to make us rich, Jim. - Come on, give us the angel. - Give this up, George. - Bite his hand! Ahh! - Come on. No way... ho way are you gonna take her. - And what'd you weasels tell Patty? - A pack of lies. Hey, you wanna compose, you need bucks! Yeah, unless you wanna keep driving that dung heap the rest of your life. Hey, you can write the angelic symphony in d minor. Get out of here! Think about it, tchaikov. See ya later, hon. - Get out of here, George! - Get going! Don't worry, I'll get it fixed. Just haven't gotten around to it yet. What happened to all the fries? Serves you right. Okay. Home, sweet home. Gonna call it quits for tonight, all right? Tomorrow, first thing, what we're gonna do is make sure he gets to look at you. Oh, no, he got out again... Come on, hurry, hurry, come on. No, brutus, no! Run! Bad dog! Bad dog! Bad dog! Stop! Bad dog! Bad doggie! Bad dog! Get away from him... that dog is a killer. Don't... don't egg him... don't... don't... Wow. That's great. You're incredible. Is she? Oh, um. Mr. Winston, what a surprise. Oh, um, I think I should take this moment to tell you how deeply sorry I am that I didn't make it over this afternoon to personally apologize about, you know, last night, but the most incredible thing has happened to me. - You see, sh... she... - Shut up. I'm going to enlighten you, young man. - Uhh! - Now, if you and this floozy of yours here... Hi, I'm Eddie Winston. It's an honor to meet you. Wow. Uh, um. Mr. Winston, this is, um... her. You see, she was hurt, and I... I wanted to... to help her. You see, Patty totally misunderstood when she came over... Say no more, Jim... I completely understand. Why don't you two just have a good time? I'll explain to pattycat and take care of everything. You don't worry about a thing. I... I don't think that would be a very good idea. You just take good care of this lovely lady. - You promise me that? - I promise. Great... okay, now you two just have a wonderful time. I... I just think you make a wonderful couple, and I'll just take care of everything, okay? - Good night, Jim. - Good night, sir. Good night, miss... I hope I do get to see you again. Golly. Ah, I feel really good! Wait a minute. Wait! Good boy. Good dog. Stay. Sit! Stop! Ahh! Owl! Let go of me! Let go, please! Owl! Had enough! Hello. Is something the matter? I mean, uh... Don't you sleep? Uh, no, I... do you remember the girl? The girl, Patty? Well, we're gonna get married. I mean, it's not like I don't wanna go with you, but... Look, tomorrow, I promise... We'll figure everything out, okay? I mean, we'll find out where you belong and who you are. Okay? - Yeah, well, I heard Winston's... - Winston's cosmetics. - Yeah, I heard they may go under. - One second... I'll transfer you. Thank you... Winston's cosmetics. Aldridge, we all know the test results on the ethereal line, and I for one don't want to hear them anymore. The question that we are here to answer is what was at fault? Why did it fail? Who are we gonna blame? Uh, the advertising campaign was poorly conceived, sir? I agree... right. We can teller and gillette, and we start again. - Agreed? - Uh, Mr. Winston, excuse me, but isn't the situation far more crucial than just changing ad agencies? I mean, doesn't the whole future of Winston's cosmetics depend on... Now, that is not true! I want these rumors squelched. This company is in perfectly capable... oh! Excuse me. I don't know if you all know, but I was attacked last night. We're sorry to hear that, sir. It was worth it, for what I discovered. I found a face to die for. A complexion that every female on earth would sell her soul for. I'm telling you, this girl is the ethereal beauty. With her, we could go international. She is everything we could ever hope for. That sounds great, Mr. Winston... We're behind you 200%, sir. Yeah, who is this girl? My daughter's fiance's mistress. Are you sure we can get her, sir? Oh, we'll get her. I will definitely get her. Uh, what about your daughter, sir? This is business, aldridge. Ed Winston's daughter will understand. Get out! I don't want to hear any more! Now, wait, wait, wait... Now, just think about the good side... - Ahh! - Look, once I get this girl working and out of the way, you and Jim are gonna be free to get back together. - I'll give you a tremendous wedding. - Ahh! Just leave me alone! I hate you! Oh, you don't care about me. Who defended you when you were having affairs on my mother? Who lied for you? Nothing matters to you but your stupid business! All right, now, pattycat, let's not hurt each other here. Uhh! Ahh! Well, that's just unavoidable, isn't it? How am I gonna face anyone now? Do you hear that? I'm hiccuping now! Here, put this on... take it. She doesn't understand what's good. That's right... okay. All right, good going... it's ok. One after the other one. Sorry. All right, boys, that's the last of the paperwork. - Where? Copyrights, trademarks... That's all you need. Show me what you got. - Oh, you're going to want to sit down for this, man. This stuff is great. - Just wash over you... just let it open your mind. - Open your mind... at the beach... angels rock. - Okay, look at this, look at this. - It's an official angel halo. - See? Angel cola. Angel cola. Everyone drinks cola... It's the biggest selling item ever... The official "I love the angel” bumper sticker, yeah! - A buck apiece... we'll sell millions of 'em. - An-gel. An-gel. Do you get it, man? Gel. Yeah. Whoa! - Shh. - Quiet. Look here... hey, look... see? This mean anything to you? Come on... see? Company picnic? Senior class? Take these off... here. No... shh... wait, don't. No, no, no... shh. - Shh. - Bad back. Old surfing injury. Good... yeah, you keep your hands to your side. You just... step... wonderful. No problem. Don't worry... when Patty sees what you are, she's... she's gonna love you. Hi, honey! Patty? Just... wait. Patty, please. Please, sweetheart, don't... Just don't overreact... let me... Please, let me explain, okay? I... you can't... Patty? Okay, honey, you know what? If you don't believe me, see for yourself. They say seeing is believing... Well, you're not gonna believe this. You're not gonna believe this, sweetheart, you're not... Aw, come on... give me a break. Patty, come on, shut off the... Patricia, these are not the actions of a person involved in a relationship based upon commitment. Patty! Come on. Ohh. Please. You've got it all wrong. She means nothing to me, nothing! Nothing? Ha! I don't hear from you for three days, tad. - You didn't even call... - Yeah. Patty! Oh, thank god. Look, please, please, don't hang up the phone. Just listen to me. I know you're furious, but I-i-i found her in my pool. I-I mean... I-I fell asleep and I woke up and there was this noise and I went outside... Ugh. Oh! Ohh! Come on. Let's go. Yes, of course, sir. I mean, if I heard, you know, if I heard this, I would think it was crazy, too, but I swear this is on the level. So you... oh, oh, wow. So you're coming. Thank you. That's tomorrow at the press club at noon. And just come as you are, you know. Just dress casually. You'll be there, okay. Great. Bye-bye. Don, that was the daily news. That's the end of the list, man. They're all coming. Uh, how about all the TV stations? All the TV stations. All the radio stations. Tabloids, the works. Ain't got the angel. Now, what are we gonna do about Sanders? Don't worry about that. I've got everything taken care of. Do you know what Jim's problem's always been? He never thinks about himself. That's why god created us. I think when this whole thing's over, he's gonna come running up here and plant a big, wet, juicy one right there on my cheek and say, "George, thank you." I wouldn't count on it. I've never seen him this stubborn. Let's face it. Jim is a screwed-up little puppy right now. Why do you think he's been having these headaches, acting like a space cadet? He knows marrying Patty and that stupid job's not what he's supposed to be doing with his life. This angel's the best thing that could've happened to him. So, how are we gonna get her, Ace? Once again, the talented and lovely miss Patty Winston will assist us. What? How? Even as we speak, it's in the works, gentlemen. Genius, this abduction. Sheer genius. Miss Patty Winston? - Yes. - These are for you! Who the hell are you? I'm the love bug. Hey, your boyfriend really cares about you. You have a good time tonight, and remember, love to live and live to love. I'm the love bug, and once you're bitten, hey, you want a love hug 'cause you'll be smitten, ha! 'Cause I'm... oh, god, that was good. Hey, did you see my son? Patty? What do you want, George? I'm embarrassed, and I apologize. - We want to help. - Oh, really. We thought maybe you'd come by at eight o'clock and drink some beer. Just the guys. No, I'm not leaving her alone. Ah! Well, bring her along. We'll go some place else. Like where? - The park? - The park? Why? Just for old times' sake? Okay, fine, George. Just one thing, all right? No screwing around, I mean it. Come on, trust me, Sanders. Sure. See you. "Trust me, Sanders." About as far as I can throw you. Oh no. I got worried. I thought you were gone. I'm sorry if I interrupted your... Your... Whatever. Phone home? We've gotta go meet the guys. We, uh... Better get you dressed. Well, I don't see him. Of course, that doesn't mean anything. George is always late. What? What? Patty. Patty! What are you doing here? I don't know. I am so stupid. Patty, wait. Please don't leave. Just... No, no, no, please. Just stay here, I gotta talk to her. Patty, don't leave! She be ours now, lads. Patty, listen, don't leave. Go. Your angel is waiting. - Listen to me! - Just leave me alone. God, you really love making a fool out of me. I'm not. Would you hear me out? If you want to break it off with me, just tell me. Listen to me. I am not leaving you! This isn't happening to me! Hurry up! Get her in, quick. Get her feet in. Come on. Come on. Get her turned around. Hurry up. Here he comes! Be careful. She's shedding! Come on, George! Don't do it, George! Don't do it! George! Nol sorry, Jim Bob, but this is for your own good. Guys, let her go. George, wait! George! Aghh! George? Hey, look, look. It's my favorite, see? Fun? Bubble bear. Look, watch. Look, bubbles. - Don, try the French fries again. - Yeah, right. - Look at this. - Mm, French fries. One of those? French fries. All right. Easy. You can have some French fries. No, no, no, no, no. You guys, check it out! Can we discuss these outfits you rented for us? Rex. You love Hawaiian. I love Hawaiian shirts, Rex. I look like a flashback. But you look great! You really look... come on! Check it out. There's so many people. Everybody came. This is typical. Oh my god. Is that the guy from channel 57? Maybe we should just forget the whole thing. Come on, you guys. I told you, you gotta watch out for that stare. Shh, it's okay. It's okay. Yeah. Now come on, you guys. It's show time. Um, yeah? Hello? No. He's not here. Sure. I'll tell him. Mm-hm, you can't make it. Press club, okay. Press club. Sure. Yeah. I'll tell him. Thank you. Thanks for calling. Press club! Good morning. Oh, hey, I guess it's afternoon already, huh? Was that supposed to be funny? I've called this press conference to present to the world the greatest find of this century. Press club. Got to be around here somewhere. Hey! Watch out, man! What's the matter with you? Look, I'm sorry about that. I'm in a bit of a hurry. Do you know where the press club is? Press club? Press club... Yeah. You go down 53... No. Press club... Well, go down 127... No. The press club. The old press club? That's the community building. Community... great, okay. Forget it. Good. Oh, my! Dang fool! And now we present to you our discovery in the interest of theological, scientific, and economic phenomenon. Why are we still here? This is a joke. I'm curious what the punch line is. George, I'm gonna kill you. Gentlemen, bring her out, please. I think this is way out of line. Ladies and gentlemen of the press, this is a real, honest-to-god angel. Agh! We can see that! Attagirl. Don't let them treat you like that. Oh, no, no, no, no. We had to keep her disguised. I'll show you why. She's a fakel these guys are trying to con you. She's no angel. Sorry, people. You've wasted your time. No, you haven't wasted your time. Look. Jim! Jim, take it easy. Agh! No, no, no! It was George's idea, I said no, I said, "bad, George, bad." It's okay. It's over. Come on, Jimmy. I'm trying to work here. We're seconds away from history, Jim. I'm trying to make a buck. Come on. Come on. Wait, wait, come back! Go get her! That's the news story of the century getting away. Go on. Do your job. Take pictures. No. Stop. Stop. No, no. Um, excuse me. What was that all about? Hold on. Hold on. Could we talk to her, then? - No. - Why not? Because she's mine. So, what have we learned here today? Our three young impresarios still swear to the validity of their angel and claim they'll get her back. I guess you could say that one man's angel is another man's girl. This is Harlan Rafferty reporting from... Agh! I don't find this amusing! Now, this is the last time I am going to ask. Where is she? We're telling you the truth. He could have taken her out of state for all we know. I don't think so. The police would have found them by now. The cops are after them? Why? What for? What did they do? It seems your friend Jim stole some valuables from my house the night of the party. That is a big load. So was that terrorist stunt. I'm gonna tell you something. I could press charges, and I could have you punks fined, and I could have you jailed. Jail? Please. Anything but that. Hey, I'd like to see you try and prove it was us. Would you? Yeah. Just say the word, pisshead. Pisshead. Yeah. Pretty effective word, "pisshead.” Now what? Cheer up, Capone. I'll get us out of here. We'll find the angel... Yeah? Yeah? What if Winston gets there first? We're toast. Uh-huh, and here's another one for you, babe. Who's bailing us out? Jim! That's a good question. One thing's for sure. Nobody's gonna find you here. Be careful. That's why I think you should love it. Come on, I know I did. I mean, that is, of course, if I can find it. It's been so long. I just hope it's still here. It's somewhere around here. Oh! There you go. Very good. You found it. Your very own high-rise penthouse. Have you seen this guy? Yeah, he looks familiar. Yeah. That's the crazy fool that liked to wreck my station the other day. What day? Tuesday. - Tuesday? - Yeah. Or I think it was Wednesday. - Tuesday or Wednesday. - Tuesday. I see you made a new friend. That sounds pretty good. We got all kinds of good stuff here. We've got stuff to clean ourselves up with. No, wait a minute. You're hungry, right? Eat this. See? That's good for you. Like that. You want this? That's what you want, huh? This right there. There you go. No, uh... One at a time, all right? Take it easy. One at a time. If you can think of any place in the world where he might be hiding with this girl, we'd all appreciate knowing. No morel now you listen. This has never accomplished anything. No, not that, you stop this violence! This is not violence, daddy. When I find that little slut, I'll show you some violence! Hey, what word rhymes with "throbbing"? Have a nice day! Hi! Yeah. Um, have you seen this guy? - He's really cute. - Have you seen him? Yeah. - Um, I'll show you. - Where? Here we go. Right there. That's him, right? Yeah, that's him. That's him. Wait a minute. Are you gonna... Aggh! Hi. You know, my father got me into music. After that, the only thing I wanted was to be a... a great composer. The only problem was, everything I composed was always more grating than great. But I kept at it, and then the last six months or so, I don't know, everything started feeling so... The headaches got so bad, I just stopped composing altogether and went back to screwing around with the guys, you know, just took some odd jobs. And then I... then I met Patty. She never liked the idea of me being a composer anyway, and somehow I thought being married and having a steady job and all that would just straighten things out in my head. And now here you are. I'm so damned confused, I don't know what to think. You know, I really care about Patty. She's... She's... Okay, so she's not you, but please, if you can't look at me without that stupid look of affection on your face, then don't look at me at all, because I've got enough problems, you know? I'm only human. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I know... I know it's not your fault. But it's crazy to feel this way about you. Don't you see? We could never have a real life together because you don't belong here. And it's not that I don't feel something, and it's not that I don't care, but... I mean, who wouldn't fall in love with you? What kind of idea was it to come down here? Just keep on looking. Hey, wait. - Stop the car. - For what? Just stop the car. What am I stopping the car for? What... what are you doing? What is it, you gotta go to the bathroom or what? Come here. Bingo. Want to hear something? I found this in my glove compartment. You like it? Um, believe it or not, this is one of the first things I ever composed and conducted in college. I... I was never too crazy about this section here, you know. I always thought I should put some more strings in because... It's not really dance music. It's... Dance music. I just wish you could tell me how you feel. Yeah. Me, too. Hello. No, he's not. Sure, I'll take a message. Where was his car found? Where's that? Oh, yeah. Thank you. I'll make sure that he gets the message, yeah. Thank you very much, detective. This is it. This is itl oh, she's gonna be so sorry. She's messed with the wrong girl. Nobody makes a fool of me. What am I doing? Okay. I'm ready, Patty. I hate that blouse! Yes. Perfect. Okay. She is dead. She's dead. She's going to be one sorry slut. Oh! My hat. My hat. My hat, my hat. So want to play tough? I can play plenty tough, sister. Whoa! Oh! Oh... Sorry I didn't get you out sooner, but you know grace. We understand, and we'll pay you back, I promise. You boys are the only ones that can help me. We've got to get to Jim and the girl before Winston does. Wait. You know where they are? I've got a pretty good idea. Thank goodness the police aren't searching the woods till morning. Woods? The treehouse! I'm embarrassed. I think this is gonna work. You tell me if this hurts, okay? Just let me know. Okay. Now go ahead. Extend them. There it is. According to the book, all your powers should be restored. That means you can... You can leave. I mean, it makes sense anyway, doesn't it? We can't stay here forever. They're gonna find us eventually. When they do, they'll turn you into a freak show. I'm sorry, I just don't think I could take that. I think it's better that you just go back to where you belong. I've got to go back, too. Right now, Patty must be... Yeah, I know. It's all the more reason for you to leave. I'm afraid down here, those are a common occurrence. Well, it's not gonna get any easier. Come on. I'll walk you to the Meadow. Ugh! Aggh! You be good. Stop it! Nope, gone. What do you think? I think she's flown the Coop. Let's keep looking. Aggh! Grr! Oh, no. Come on, now. Don't play around. Look, I'm not feeling too swift, and I want to get back. Don't do this to me. Look, you know how I feel about you. It's just that... Patty? Hi. How'd you find me? You look awful. Thank you. What happened to you? I regained my feminine dignity. Now, where's that angel bitch, hmm? I guess she's gone. I'm sorry. I really wanted you to meet her. Liar! Oops. I suppose I deserved that for hurting you. Mmm. But the angel is gone. Oh, yeah? Well, I don't think so. You bastard! How dare you hit me! I didn't. I swear I didn't. Oh, you are gonna regret that move, mister. Where's my rifle? Oh, no, no, no. Patty, come on. You can't be serious. Go to hell! Aggh! Oh, boy. Okay. Come on. Come on, you gotta show yourself. You kicked me in my heinie. Where are you? Look, there's no need for this, don't do this. Nobody ever kicks me in my heinie. - Aggh. - You hear? Nobody! What? He did what? He hit me, daddy. And then he kicked me in my heinie. Your heinie? Oh, honey. I didn't do it. I swear I didn't. It was her. I was nowhere near her, I didn't even touch her. She did it. Where is she? She's gone, but she's here. I mean, I can't find her. She kicked... She disappeared. You know, I read in the book that a healthy angel... You better give us some answers, young man, and I mean the truth! Nobody has to get hurt here. You just tell me where she is, and we'll forget the whole affair. What? Just a minute. I've got some say here. Look, just settle down! This is business, right, wimp? It's just between us men. That's right, my friend! Just between us men, no? Unhand that wimp! Pisshead! My heroes. Ah! That's my dad. You're in trouble now, Eddie. Hiya, pa. What have you done to my son? Hey! Don't start something that you can't finish. Kick his butt, Ben! Kick his butt, Ben. Kick his butt, Ben! Kick his butt, Ben. Shut up! Kick her butt, then! Kick her butt, then. Kick her butt, then! Let him go. I'm not gonna ask you again. Just as soon as he tells me where she is, you can have the punk. Now, where is she? I want her! Did you have garlic for lunch? Aggh! Hey, hey! Get off of him! Arrgh! Daddy! Spread out, spread out! Jim. - Jim Bob. - Jim? Boys, we'd better get him to a hospital. Don, get his feet. Come on, buddy. Okay, get up. Dr. William Reid to surgical 1. Dr. William Reid to surgical 1. I'm sorry, but it's not good. Your son has a cerebral tumor in a very advanced stage. Has he been complaining of severe headaches? Hi. Listen. I'm sorry that I yelled at you. I didn't really want you to go. I'm going to die, huh? That's why you're here. You were supposed to take me that first night, the night of the party, only you broke your wing and messed up your mission, huh? Does everybody get you when they go? Good. I'd be jealous. I'm scared. I guess that's kind of natural, isn't it? I'm sorry we didn't have more time together. There's so much I wanted to share with you. I love you. Jim? We didn't realize that, um... If we'd have, uh, you know... We were just trying to make... - George. - Happy. - He's already... - No, he isn't. And you know you shouldn't be in here. - But we have to tell him something. - You can do that tomorrow. Now he needs his rest. Well, we thought that he might not... Don't worry. Jim's gonna be around for quite a while. I have that on the highest authority. Now if you don't mind, I need to be alone with my patient. So how do you feel? Fine. Wait a minute. - How? - An answer to an angel's prayer. Do you like it? Look at that. I got a leave of absence for good behavior. I guess he thought we could make some good music together. Jim, I'm starving. Do you feel well enough to take me out for some French fries?
