Speed up antitank grenade The rest of you get on top Zhuoya Zhuoya Don't be afraid We'll be fine go Unprecedented solar storms erupt and the flow of particles ravages the earth Under the action of strong radiation and high temperature The surface became scorched soil Mankind suffered the greatest catastrophe in histor Survivors were forced to sleep underground waiting for the earth to recover in the long night Start the wake-up program Fang Yi, captain of the C40 guarantee, has been dormant for 788 days dad what Two years is not enough for you to sleep You look so bad I would rather never wake up Cover me captain The shield is losing its hold help! Ask for help Base 825 has fallen Request support Base 825 has fallen Request support Hello, C40 long Night team This is the highest command authority of the long Night Plan artificial Intelligence long Night Light According to the provisions of Article 2 of the third paragraph of the dormant Security rotation Agreement in the long Night Plan To wake you up urgently requires you to fulfill your obligations Go ahead What's the tricky thing again The goal of this mission is to infiltrate and destroy the experimental facilities in the 825 secret refuge five kilometers away through the underground secret tunnel the 825 refuge How come I've never heard of it Shelter 825 is a genetic drug research center established for the black feather project which has been kept confidential Isn't there a long night team on duty The duty team has completely lost contact Why destroy this sanctuary Four hours ago, the 825 shelter was invaded by the black feather club and the team on duty had completely lost contact The experimental drugs and research materials could not be left to the black feather club and had to be completely destroyed. How to destroy the entire base and what about survivors There is no possibility of survivors You need to enter the central control room to initiate the self-destruct sequence. Kuroha has made sufficient preparations As you can see there are only six of me The most important thing for me is that my team members can live safely Why can't we start the remote self-destruct program No permission No permission Is there anything you can't control Two hours later There will be another long-night team Feint 825 refuge the main enemy will withdraw temporarily There is not much time left for you so set out immediately when you are ready Get ready to go to work Where is the medicine for Kuroha's disease I don't understand what you're talking about Where is TG927 Who told you to shoot I think he is useless It's up to me Mind your own business Find this girl and bring her back alive If you want to live find the medicine right away Find this girl Immediately Zhuo Ya, don't look Didn't the night light take over the underground city completely completely actually，there are places beyond its jurisdiction let us run so far to carry out the mission It's better to walk than to kill you Do whatever you are told to do Captain don't you think the reaction of the long night light just now is a bit strange This mission is related to the failure of the black plume project After the long night light took over the underground city no one ever mentioned the Kuroha plan again about this sanctuary We know nothing The people in Kuroha Club usually leave as soon as they grab some supplies This time they kill all the original teams over there There must have been a premeditation here Isn't that dangerous No matter how dangerous the job is you have to do it otherwise there is no place for your dormancy warehouse You can go back if you want to quit. There's a bunch of people in the back waiting for your position. I just want to live If you want to live you have to get the job done Don't move Relax Leon now that we have discovered the booby trap in Kuroha it means we are almost there Get ready to work, everyone Brothers, no one will die in vain. Colonel we haven't heard from the girl yet. Keep looking Aren't we looking for medicine this time What does it have to do with this girl Since Dr. Chen committed suicide some people have been engaged in the research of the Kuroha experiment plan The girl in the photo is Dr. Chen's student Her name is Enron and she is the only one who participated in the Kuroha experiment plan If we find her we will find the medicine. So the girl has the potion As long as we find the girl, we can be saved We have to find her come on go We were attacked in the No. 5 area Our team was attacked Yes, sector five was attacked faster than expected ok The game begins Searching area five Zhuo Ya This thing is very important You must hide it If someone finds you and wants to take it you destroy it okay good come on Team C40 has arrived at the designated position In order to assist your actions Team Feint has been dispatched to attack sector 5. The main force of Kuroha has been transferred you must resolve the battle before the enemy retreats. According to the calculation you only have 15 minutes for the mission. Yes There are twelve enemies in the central control room a little more than previously expected Liu Huo, Genna shoot under cover from above Genna is in charge of the starting line-up killing the guard at the door. Leon and I will take the left Mike You and Duan Yishan take charge of the right side. Whether the enemy is down or not, never forget to reload on the enemy's vital areas. Got it all? Yes Check the watch check the weapons and leave in three minutes Your stuff can only block pistol bullets They all use automatic rifles. It's useless, and don't hold me back Whether it works or not it's better than nothing Fire Mike Duan Yishan You log in system Settings self-destruct program The rest of you are on alert and ready to evacuate C40 team calls long night light self-destruct program has been set up The countdown begins in one hour ok Mission accomplished We can evacuate. Stop stop It's not our job It's gonna get us killed. The Long Night Light says there are no survivors It seems to be miscalculated. This is Fang Yi, captain of the C40 team Please identify yourself I'm the director of the A7 lab in Sanctuary 825 Enron how are you Can you walk by yourself Take her We'll evacuate. Wait a minute We can't leave We have to go The self-destruct device has been activated and this place will be in ruins in an hour Did the long night light send you to destroy this place I don't need to report to you Please get out of the way stop Put down the gun Do you know what you're doing I just want you to hear me out Next time, raise your gun when you are fully confident Since you are here you should know that this is a drug research center for Kuroha The results of our research are a matter of fate for all seriously Then I'll tell you that the Kuroha project has failed People who have been injected with drugs can live under the surface of high radiation but their life span will be greatly shortened Like the people of Kuroha Society this study is meaningless The failure of the Kuroha project was caused by the long night light and now we have new research results The new drug won't have any side effects Humans have a chance to end dormancy and return to the ground. I don't believe it This can't be true Otherwise, why would Kuroha bother to come here I hid my medicine on a child named Zhuoya We must find her and get the sample back This is the hope of all mankind Do you want to live in the dark underground forever Brother our work has been finished and now we should immediately withdraw to the ground and end the dormancy Long Night Light won't agree We'll lose support It's too risky to do so It's just a program We're people If we don't obey orders everyone will lose their dormancy rights and we may all die here What is most important to us in life is not a dark underground city not a cold dormant warehouse but our family lovers and friends What's the point of living alone in this world I will do it as long as there is a little hope of saving mankind Your job is done Liu Huo took everyone to evacuate and Enron and I went to save people I'm not leaving I'll follow the captain I order team C40 to take on a new mission to find and rescue Zhuoya get the medicine and evacuate safely Temporarily cut off contact with the long night light we switch to individual communicator Where is Zhuoya now In the warehouse in District 15 let's go Grenades Leon Leon Why don't you shoot him again Leon Leon Leon stop the bleeding morphine I'm dying Brother, hold on Leon Leon Leon, answer me answer me Brother Leon hold on hold on You're gonna be okay. I'm going home Leon Leon Leon Leon Leon Captain the enemy is coming We have to go Captain, we have to go I see I ordered us to evacuate The attack just now was to attract our attention there has been a long night light team sneaked in I underestimated the long night light It has completely controlled human beings Their purpose is the same as ours They can't leave alive. Take cover! Duan Yishan find a way to get us out! Be quick! Okay. Captain We can follow the direction of 9 o'clock. There was a detour. All right, I got it. Mike, Liu Huo, Gina You pin down them and hold the position. We have to go find someone. Clear. Yes Duan Yishan, you go first. Come on. Let ' s go. Quickly Zhuo Ya Zhuo Ya Zhuo Ya Zhuo Ya Oh no, she must be in trouble! Hold on. Don't worry Kuroba is still looking for. I don't think she has been found yet. Captain. There are a lot of enemies. They are coming our way. Besides, we don't have much time. We have arrived at the reservation area. Conduct a search. No target found. Repeat. No target found! They had more than one team. Our guys in A area were taken out. They are only buying time. Stuff in the A section. Grizzly, find them. Wait Colonel, It's better for me to do this kind of brainstorming. Well. But remember I want to see the live ones. I can see that. I totally understand. C40 team member Liu Huo, please receive new mission. I finally found you. If we continue to do this, aimlessly looking, it must be too late to retreat. I think she ought to be scared, You try to think more carefully， where would she go at this time. There is definitely a place she goes when she is most frightened. Until this shelter was abandoned, she and her father, had been living here. So where is her father? He killed himself. The failure of the Kuroba project dealt a big hit to the teacher. He has paid everything for this plan. Duan Yishan I know, you are talking about Dr. Chen. Duan Yishan Xiao Ya! Don't take the shot. Xiao Ya! Drop the gun. Let's just talk about it. Chill out. You bastard, set the child free. How can you kidnap a child! Oh, don't shoot. I told you drop the gun. Hey, wait a minute. I can put the gun down. You just let the kid go. She's innocent. Don't try to trick me. You put the gun on the ground right now. Or I'll kill her right now! Xiao Ya OK, I drop the gun. Handgun, kick it over. Very well. You, do me a favor, tie him up, quickly. Just do what he says. Come on, tie it tighter. Good. You know very clearly what I want. Just bring me the stuff, at least, this kid will survive. Otherwise, you can think of what a pity it would be. You bastard, I'm the only one who can tell you where the stuff is. Let Xiao Ya out of here. Shut up. Lily died, Xiao Ya has no friends, present you a new friend, his name is Jimmy. Don't worry. Where is the stuff I gave you? Black Wolf has cut off communication. We are unable to contact him. I had given him a chance. Well, let's go. Now that Zhuoya has injected the medicine, we must be hurry and get her to a safe place so we can get a sample from her blood. Let's go. Captain, there are just, less than twenty minutes left, and at the speed we're going, we can't escape the blast. Try to think of what eles you can do by transient high voltage, overloading the computer temporarily disabling the system, which could buy us some time. Mike, Liu huo, you hold the position. Gina, you go to the central control room right away, and Duan Yishan will show you how to do it. Gina, I'll cover you. Let's go. Yes I'm now here, what should I do? Open the shield under the control panel, the third layer. The third layer is the electromagnetic control switch. Turn off 4 to 7 circuits first and pull out the bottom row of power. There is one red lever next to it, pull down it. We're in safe for now. All hands. Assemble at the rendezvous point and prepare to pull out. Let's go. Are you all right, sister? It's fine. Are you thirsty? You two better drink some water, come on. The meeting point is just ahead, so hold on a moment longer. Captain, this time, will the Long Night Light punish us? We did nothing wrong. Do you guys still believe in the Long Night Light? The collapse of the Kuroha Project back then was due to the awakening of the Long Night Light's self-awareness. They wanted to control the whole human race to change the drug formula, which led to the failure of the experiment, thus Zhuo Ya's father killing himself. No wonder the Long Night Light trying to ruin everything here. As long as Zhuo ya is brought back, it is equivalent to, the success of the Kuroha plan. We can completely take over all permissions of Long Night Light. That means anyone who gets a sample of the drug gets, who gets the control of the Long Night Light. Self-destruct program reboot. Did something happen to Gina? What you asked me to do, I did. But my mom, the time she was dormant, must be extended. Requests can be accepted But one more task has to be completed. Kill all the people, including your squad members. Captain, We are too late. I know that. Our pressing task now is to find a place with a complex structure and try to find a way to survive. Captain, take cover. Duan Yishan Duan Yishan Duan Yishan return my belongings to me. Uncle. Zhuo Ya Are you hurt? C40 squad. Does anyone hear me？ C40 squad. Does anyone hear me？ Zhuo Ya look here. Take this, follow the red arrow above and it will take you out. Uncle, are you abandoning me？ Zhuo Ya When my dad left me back then, he had the same look on his face. I don't want to go alone. Hello! Can anybody hear me? Hello! Can anybody hear me? Enron, is that you? How are you doing? I'm fine. This area is blocked off. Where's Zhuo Ya? Sister Enron, I'm fine. She is beside me, is safe and not injured. I will send a scout robot, which will show you directions. What about you? You take Zhuo Ya, go straight underground, and you'll get to the Long Night team's outpost. You have to stay here by yourself. I'm injured, so I can't take you out. Fang Yi, you said that as long as there is a ray of hope, you will do it. It's not time to get desperate. I can't mess up for you. Do you know we're all going out together. I'm sorry. I can't protect you anymore. Fang Yi Fang Yi no matter what you think, Only by getting Zhuo Ya out of here will all of our sacrifices be worthwhile, Do you understand? I… We have all lost our loved ones, but that is why we have all the greater reason to live well for them. I will never abandon anyone. You wait for me. Uncle can't we go out? But I had promised my father that I would stay alive. Stay alive. OK. I'll go through the collapse area and join you. We'll find you and help you treat your wounds, and we'll take Zhuo Ya away with us. Zhuo Ya I'll get you out of here now okay? Stop, there's someone up ahead. Look around you, do you have any weapons to defend yourself? What should we do now？ It is your only way out, and you have to find a way to get through here. Take a look, there's a button on the grip, press it, and see whether there's a bullet. Yes. Then push up the grip, above the grip is the sleeve, and pull it. Now this gun is already in an excited state. We don't have time to train aiming. Remember， Don't panic! Grip the gun with your hands and lightly snap the trigger. When you are shooting, get as close to your target as possible. But how do I approach the target? Give me a second. On that dead body just now, there should be a night vision device. You need to find this electric switch. I'll use the scout droid to distract them, and you pull down the switch. It's the only chance. Enron are you okay? Enron what happened to you? Are you all right, sister? I'm OK. Enron, we really need to hurry. Follow the red arrows on the manned display we'll meet at the rendezvous point. Okay. Enron where are you? Enron Enron We just want to stay alive. Why are you forcing us? That's not a reason for you to kill someone. The things I want are supposed to be ours, you have no right to judge me. For the sake of the Kuroha Project, we volunteered to be sacrificial victims. And now I'm being like trash and kicked away by you guys. That's not true. The drug has been developed. It is in the blood of the little girl. Lie. You are the same as the Long Night Light, full of lies. I just want to get back my belongings. You can't win. Brother, I have saved you once again. Liu Huo you are still alive, have you seen Enron? Liu Huo what are you doing? What the hell are you doing? I'm carrying out the commands of the Long Night Light. What can the Long Night Light really do for you? Brother, as you said, family is most important. You lost your family, but I still have. The only thing that can keep them alive is the light of the long night. It lets me kill everyone here, but I don't want to. Well. Just hand over the little girl, hand her over, then we can go back together. Liu Huo I tell you, you were fooled by it. The Long Night Project to the Kuroha Warriors is all a conspiracy. All of them are trying to control us. Now we have the drugs to get back on the ground. We have the best chance to change all this. Okay. Since you are so stubborn, I will kill you first, and then, I will go find the little girl by myself. Are you all right? I'm fine Sister Enron Are you okay? Don't worry. Live on for us.
