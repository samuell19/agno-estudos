(CAMERA CLICKING AND BEEPING) DOC WATSON: Coco. Coming. Do you need any help, Doc Watson? Scan this for me. Sure thing, Doc. Could it be the lost Deer Tribe of Fantastica? This carving is incredibly ancient. Never seen anything like it. (COUGHING) Here, have some of my water, Doc. Lucia, this is the lost totem worshiped by the Deer Clan. After every deer dies, the deer tribe put the antlers here to honor them. To the tribe, the deer were not just respected, but thought to be mystical, almost divine. Doc Watson, I found something! (WIND WHISTLING) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) Work hard all four seasons, so you don't waste a minute of time. Hmm, sensible. Regret belongs to the lazy. Dare to have the courage to pursue your dream. A man without a dream is like a fish in a bucket. My dream starts right now. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) I won't be a bucket fish! Hyah! Huh? (SHOUTS) Oh my. Yeah, fish in a bucket are my favorite kind of food. Ah, jeez. (SHOUTS) BRIAR: Get back here! BRAMBLE: There's nowhere to run! (GRUNTING) That's it, just a little further now. Doc Watson, I think I may have found something. She found it. Okay, mini sphere, do your thing. (BEEPING) Whoa. Doc, are you getting this? Huh? Could this be a link to the migration of the Deer Tribe out of Fantastica? Hold there. Coco, scan that image and get back here. (BEEPING) Scanning complete. (RUMBLING) Uh oh. Ah! Whoa! Ah! Whoa! (CRASHING) Ah! Doc Watson. Huh? (CHUCKLES) (MURMURING) Doc Watson! Now, Pounder. Hey there, how's it going? We're gonna be good friends. (MURMURING) Coco, we're fine! Protect the map! Initiate Booster Protocol! Booster Protocol? Right. WHIPLASH: You can't run. Coco doesn't run. Coco flies. Bye bye. (GASPS) Move it! Get up! Hey, wait for me! (PANTING) Stop right there. No, you two stop. Logger Vick, stop running. It says so in this book I've got here. I'll read you something, eh? "Don't give up easy when things are bad, "because you just might be one step away from success." (SIGHS) Isn't this great? Stop me if this is going past your intellectual level. Says here, you can change your fate. Anyone can do it, even you? No way! Oh boy, that's okay! Fools take a look at me now! Your fate is closer than you think! I may be poor now, bears, but I'm going to change my fate, woohoo! We can't let him cut our trees. I feel like he ran away. After him! Here we go! (YELLING) Wait! Come back here! (YELLING) Briar, what's that? POUNDER: Ollie ollie oxen free! (GRUNTING) Briar, who are those people? I don't know. But they don't look friendly. I know who you are. (GRUNTING) There! Huh? (YELLING) Get the robot! Bramble. Quick, follow them. Oh! (GRUNTING) (SHOUTING) What's going on? Pounder! On it! (YELLING) (GRUNTING) Where'd they go? Down there. POUNDER: Huh? (PANTING) Look, Briar! (GROANING) Get off me. This is the craziest day ever. Huh? Wha? (GROANS) Logger Vick, what is that thing? I don't know. (BEEPING) Huh? What do you think you're doing? I'm all over the place! Where are my tracks? My hand? I'm just repairing you. Only one around here who can. Repairing? Your shell is broken, and your control panel's all busted up. But I can fix it for you. Are you sure about that? Hmm. Relax. What now? Relax. Are you actually qualified to do this? Robots are easy. I'll take that as a no, then. Lookie here! I'm famous around here for repairing things. Cool, huh? Yeah, okay. If I had legs, you'd be pulling them. I think you're being unreasonable. I'm not charging ya. Humph. We're back, here you go. Vickarino, did you fix the robot yet? (LAUGHING) (GRUNTING) Bramble, come on. Put me down! I'm not a toy. (BRAMBLE LAUGHS) COCO: Are we still doing this? Okay, well I'll believe it when I see it. (SIGHS) Oh, you'll see! So, what's your name, huh? I am Coco 503, track-type Titanium alloy, an exploration and archeological robot. Robo-girl, that's what I'll call ya! Please don't call me that. So Robo-girl, what're you doing way out here? Oh, and who were those bad guys, huh? Coco. It's not that hard. Coco-co-co-co-co-co-c, Let go of my speech center before you mess me up even more! Huh? (LIGHT MUSIC) (CHUCKLES) Job's all done. (TRIUMPHANT MUSIC) Hey, do you mind? Oh. I just thought it'd be more dramatic. Huh? Hang on, my chip is produced by Fantawild, my track is equipped with sensors, and my cover utilizes memory alloy by the aerospace bureau. What do you call this old thing? Oh, I see. (CLEARS THROAT) (RECORD SCRATCHING) Yo, yo, check it out, yo. All right! Victor the repair guy, fix this robot, yeah. What'd you think? I think you're wasting your time as a repair guy. You should be a professional rapper. So, there are four of us on the mission. Me and three archeologists. Who would make such a sassy robot? Certainly has some nerve, doesn't she? Not even a single thank you for fixing her. Hmph! Toffee nose. COCO: We need to get to Fantastica to find the treasure before those bad guys do. BRIAR: Treasure? Treasure? That's right. A pair of golden antlers that have been passed down for thousands of years among the Deer Tribe. Antlers? Vick, this is where your life changes! Deer tribe? I need to protect the golden antlers. I have to go. Bye guys. - Hey, hold up. - We only just met. Hold on, guys! (FUNKY MUSIC) Archeologist Victor, ready to show you around, and find the treasure. Seriously? Of course! (LAUGHING) Right! From hence forth, I'll guide ya. We can find that treasure together. Vick is Indiana Jones now? I don't know. You know we can't trust him. Fine then, you can go alone all right, but when you break down again, you'll want me to fix you, won't ya? I will not be breaking down again! (CLANGING) - (DRAMATIC MUSIC) - Uh-huh. The golden antlers have been hidden for centuries. But we should be able to find some clues in this projection. Hey bro, what is that thing? Hmm, no idea. But you're the smart one. (LAUGHING) Obviously you can't understand this. Archeology isn't like finding honey. Hey, finding honey is not easy! Well, hmm, could be, if you happen to know the right guy. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) A long long time ago, there was a lone hunter who traversed the open wilderness. - Hunter? - Hunter? He was agile, the truest shot. (LAUGHING) There was a snow, unlike any Fantastica had ever seen. The entire land was covered in a blanket of ice. The hunter was hungry and cold, and felt death beckoning him, when suddenly there appeared a bright golden deer. This mystical creature carried the hunter on its back all the way to safety. The deer was exhausted, and fell over, never to rise. Suddenly the snow melted away and in its place was left a green paradise. (LAUGHING) The hunter was saved. The body of the golden deer disappeared, leaving only a pair of golden antlers. (SIGHS) Since then, the descendants of the hunter have been known as the Deer Tribe. Yeah, bravo! And what about the mural? But of course. The stone! Above it shows the tribe and the deer living in unity. And below, it shows the migration of the Deer Tribe out of Fantastica. If you're asking me, you will find your treasure at Glade Glacier! But how do we find the glacier, huh? Head north from here, and you will find an ancient forest. Find the forest, and find the glacier. Glacier? Forest? Isn't that where we used to hang out as little cubs! COCO: Wait, you know this place? Uh-huh. - Let's do it! - Before you go. Huh? These antlers are sacred. If they are removed, the whole world will end! (WHIMPERING) (LAUGHING) You should have seen your face. It's just an old fairy's tale. I know that. I wasn't scared. Okey-dokey. Bye. (SHOUTS) (CHUCKLES) (INSECTS CHIRPING) (BELL RINGING) (MUMBLING) (DOORS BANGING) Shop's closed. Come back later. WHIPLASH: Where's the robot? What? Wait, who are you? You heard me. Don't make me ask twice. You can't do this! Put that priceless fossil back, and leave! Huh? (GASPS) All right. I'll talk. (UPBEAT MUSIC) ♪ Yeah ♪ Yeah ♪ Yeah (WHOOPING AND CHEERING) (LAUGHING) Yeah! Your beat up old truck is super slow. I'd get there faster on my own. You're sure about that? ♪ The burning sun ♪ Hey hey ♪ Hey hey ♪ Whoa (GRUNTING) BRIAR: Why don't we just call AAA? An embarrassment to all wheels. Don't just stand there. Pull! BRAMBLE: It's all in the hindquarters. ♪ Under the burning sun We made it! Whoa! Careful, the trees here are all very ancient. Few people have ever set foot in this place. Ah, that's good to know. We're the only ones who know about the deer tribe. (LAUGHING) Yeah. Haha, well, here we are. I mean who could've thought? Hey, let's talk about those antlers, eh? No. (GROANS) Hey Briar, are we in the right place? Absolutely, Bramble and I used to live here as cubs. Oh, I'm sorry, Coco. It wasn't on purpose. It was an accident. Of course it wasn't on purpose. You did it with purpose! How can I make you less angry? In situations like this, I believe you humans call it the cold shoulder. What now? I'm done. You're not gonna make this easy for me, are ya? You might as well go home. You can't contribute much help anyway. Say what? And for your information, I've been helping you all the way. I didn't ask you to, did I? Without me, you'd be scrap metal! That's not true. It's not true? You're a pompous piece of scrap metal! I don't want to talk to you anymore. We're finished! Fine with me! That's enough! We've been walking for two days now. Are we there yet? We should be getting close. Let's rest here. I'm exhausted! Bramble, don't mind me. Can't you control that? COCO: Hmph! (GULPING) That's good. Oh yeah! Huh? Hold on. That looks familiar. Oh, I know this place! (CHUCKLES) - Bramble! - Bramble! Hey! Hey, you remember, we used to scratch our backs on this? - No we didn't. - Oh and over here. Bramble, be careful! Hey, wait up. Hey Briar, look, you remember this? Is this where we used to play hide-and-seek? Yeah! Come on, it's this way. (PANTING) Oh man. Huh? Yeah. Oh, what's wrong? What'd you stop for, bro? Bramble, does this hole look familiar to you? I remember. (CRYING OUT) Ah! Briar, how do we get out? Think of something! MAN: Hey, what do we got here? A couple of bear cubs, huh? Stay back, bro. MAN: We could make a nice buck or two for this catch. MAN: You said it. MAN: Hey, what's that? MAN: What the? Look out! (SHOUTING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) MAN: You there, stay safe. Can a bear's memory last that long? Mm-hmm, that's right, yeah. Huh? Hmph! - Hmm? - Huh? Hey Coco. Follow me. What the? Hey Briar, where are you going? We're here. Whoa. This is it. - Whoa! - Whoa! Whiplash, they went this way. Move it. (SLURPING) Hey guys, don't leave me. (ADVENTUROUS MUSIC) ALL: Wow. Oop, why'd you do that? COCO: Gentlemen, I give you Glade Glacier. According to the analysis of the ice here, this cave was formed over two million years ago during the last ice age. Wow. This symbol is trapped. And this one too. Huh? I'm sure all these signs have to mean something, Coco. Need any help, eh? Yes. I need you to stay out of my way. Briar, what do these signs mean? I wish I knew. Hey Coco, have you seen these icicles? Good talk. I don't like this at all. Huh? We're here for you. We're trying to help. Something cut this ice like a knife. Or something stronger. Something much stronger. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (BEEPING) Slap my circuits, I've got it! Huh? Hey, I thought you said you didn't need my help. You won't need that. That's my hat, robot! COCO: Don't move! Hey, hey. Stay here and hold still. You are the key to finding the golden antlers. And perfect. Coco, what're you doing? Why am I over here? You'll see soon enough. Remember, don't move a muscle. Huh? (GASPS) (GRUNTING) Hey, Briar, Briar, look. My brain box is tingling. (GASPING) Vick, You can stay if you're scared. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (GRUNTING) BRIAR: Got ya Bramble, be careful. BRAMBLE: Whoa. I miss the forest! (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (BEEPING) What is that thing? It's a map. It's going to show us how to get to the antlers. We're so close now, let's go! (SHOUTING) (GROANING) (WHIMPERS) We'll be taking that. (VICK SHOUTS) And that's why they call me Pounder. On me! (SHOUTING) Get them. (PANTING) BRAMBLE: I'm not scared, you're scared.

(GRUNTS) POUNDER: Yah! Coco! (GASPS) What was that? (GASPING) (EERIE MUSIC) This place would be scary if I weren't so brave. Oh? (SCREAMS) I'm a nice bear, don't hurt me! (SHOUTS) (LAUGHING) Coco, you're okay, thank goodness! I don't care who you are, or where you came from. That map is ours. (GRUNTING) Don't be sad. There's plenty of beatings to go around. (SHOUTING) - Too easy. - Uh-oh. (SHOUTING) (LAUGHS) We should be on our way now. (SHOUTING) No! (CHUCKLES) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (WHIPLASH SHOUTS) (GRUNTING) (CHUCKLING) C'mon. Huh? So did we win? Thank you so, huh? She just left? (GROANING) But who is she? I bet she's from the Deer Tribe, yeah. Nonsense! The Deer Tribe disappeared several years ago. That's what my database says. Not right here. It is useless. Is not! Come on. (LAUGHS) Let's get going. Hmph! (BUZZING) Well. Where is it? Sorry, we had problems. A simple task, why have you failed? They were unpredictable and much stronger. Besides the bald guy, and the two bears, there's a robot, and a beautiful girl! - Pound. - Fool. A girl? You don't say. Are you kidding me? (LAUGHING) Just give us another chance. A girl and a robot, how terrifying! (GRUNTS) Fine, we'll all go back. (GENTLE MUSIC) (YAWNS) (GRUNTING) COCO: The fish. Woohoo, I found the fish! Coco, let's take a break and eat something. I'm so starving. I can't go on. You mammals sure are inefficient explorers. Huh? Ugh, it's gross! It's so weird. I've never seen any of these plants before. Here we go. Actinidia arguta, commonly known as a kiwi. Huh? BRIAR: So gross. That doesn't look like a kiwi to me. Careful of its tail now. (SHOUTING) It doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense! There, that's a raspberry. It belongs to the genus Rubus of the rose family. We can eat that. Raspberries! Outta the way! (LAUGHS) Huh? It's walking away! Bramble! (GASPING) This can't be happening. It's grapefruit? This way guys, come on. COCO: Cantaloupe? Or mango? (SHOUTING) Coco, run! (SHOUTING) COCO: There, climb that tree! (SHOUTING) Where's Coco? This doesn't make sense. I have a database of every plant, animal, and mineral in the entire world! None of this should exist. Speaking scientifically, this place is bonkers. (CLEARS THROAT) It doesn't make sense to me! Oh! Your super brain needs updating. You did this to me! You're blaming the guy who saved your life? - Hmph! - Hmph! BRAMBLE: We found food! Hey! (LAUGHING) Humans. (GASPING) This berry contains poisonous gas. She saved you. But who is she? Look, she's eating those! (PANTING) Got it. I'm so glad I don't have a stomach holding me back. What mineral is this? I need to conduct further research. - Hey Coco. - Huh? Bet you wish you could eat now. These're great! What the? What is that? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (THUNDER CRASHING) (WIND WHOOSHING) (YAWNS) POUNDER: Well boss, welcome to Fantastica. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) Huh? POUNDER: Hey Boss, it's pretty trippy, right? (laughs) Hey Boss, don't step in that! That was a close one. (PANTING) BRIAR: What is that thing? What? How should I know? It's gotta be Coco's fault. I didn't do anything! Maybe it's because you guys ate its food. (SHOUTING) (GROANING) Don't stop, it's gaining on me! (GROWLING) (WHIMPERING) (GROWLING) It's scared to come in. (GASPING) I hate to say it, but maybe... (WHIMPERING) Stop this! You're all cowards. These are just plants, and fruits. Don't touch it! It's getting stranger by the minute. There's no telling what will happen. Oh, come on! This is just a piece of fruit. Huh? (GASPING) And this is just some pollen. Oh, it's so pretty! (CHUCKLES) Huh? Oh, it's like a balloon! Huh? Bramble! (GASPING) What's happening? They're sticky! VICK: Get away from me! Get away! Release me! Let me go! What are these things? Briar, what are we gonna do? I'm stuck! I'm afraid of heights! Huh? Coco! It wants its child! Try and be brave! What? (GENTLE MUSIC) (THUDDING) Hey little guy, you can go to your mommy now. It can fly? Huh. Where'd she go? COCO: Right here! (GASPS) Hey bro, did you see the feathers? Let's go! Where are you going now? Wowee! Look at those! They're beautiful. (BEEPING) Hmph. Just simple tricks to attract kids. Nothing special. Yeah, but Boss, didn't you ever watch cartoons when you were little? (SOMBER MUSIC) (LAUGHING) (DOORS CLOSING) And why would I do that? It's nonsense. POUNDER: Jeez, your childhood must have been pretty dull. What? What is it? Let me at it! Hmm? - Nothing. - Huh? You want the whole forest to hear us, huh? (GASPING) (LAUGHS) Hi there, I'm Bramble. What's your name? It's Naya. The name's Briar. Oh hiya. I'm Vick. It's nice to meet ya. Naya, those feathers, I've seen them before. They're my grandpa's. Ah, when we were real little your Grandpa saved us! You're from the Deer Tribe, huh? A mushroom elf. That was clumsy of me. In Fantastica, we believe our life is sacred. Even the trees. Grandpa Oak said that it's going to rain. Grandpa Oak? A tree can't speak. It has no brain, and no mouth. That doesn't make sense. Oh come on. You don't either. I'm the only thing our here that does. A tree predicting the rain. (RAIN PATTERING) (LAUGHING) (GASPING) ♪ Close my eyes, spread my wings ♪ ♪ Feel my heart beat in the light ♪ I don't trust it. Come on, Coco, I'll carry you. Put me down!

If there was danger, blow this, then, the Golden Deer would come and save us! Wow. It's so amazing! I have faith that they're still here. Naya, have you heard of the Golden Antlers? Of course. Really? Long ago, the deer left us. The Golden Antlers were stored in The Antler Valley. That's where they'll be. But those thieves, they're coming for 'em. Mm-hmm. (GASPS) Oh, but why? Don't worry!

Yeah, if we needed something stolen! Listen up, guys. We can do this! After all we've been through, we have risked everything and we've come too far. So no matter what lies ahead, we can't be stopped. We look pretty stopped to me. (GASPING) Briar... (GASPING) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC) (SHOUTS) Please don't eat me, bears don't taste good!

They're so glorious! Woohoo! Come to Papa! Huh? Force sealed, huh? I'll show that rackem' frackem' good for nothing. (SHOUTING) Interesting. Nice, how about some fire? It's no use. The power of the Golden Antlers has generated a gravitational field. Hence the spatial warping. Huh? Not a problem. I brought this. (BEEPING) I was solving equations like this when I was still in school. Step away from the antlers, and get out of our home! Go! (BEEPING) It's time to see what these puppies can really do!
