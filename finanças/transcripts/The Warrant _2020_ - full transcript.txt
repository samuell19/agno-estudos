-=Sync&Corrected by Misiek666=- Fire! Each of our lives is a story. And every story is about a struggle. A fight. A fight against sickness... poverty... each other. Some fight for big things. Ideas... freedoms... rights. Some fight for little things. A name, a piece of land... Or for a friend. The little liberties. There's a fight inside men as well. A fight against a reckoning. A reckoning of all the things we've done. Or didn't do. My granddaddy... He called it a warrant. "Dear Bonnie, today marks four years. Four years of fightin'. Feels like 400. At the time of this letter, our son's still safe and well. As well as can be expected. He's become close with Virgil's boy, Perkins. I know you don't approve of "The Saint" as we've come to call him. Let's go. Ironic, I know. But his son is a good kid. When I get back- When we get back... We'll have stories to tell, Bonnie girl. No joy? He won't check his gun and he won't tell me why he's here. Boar headed bounty hunter. I'll go in and get him out. You know what happened last time. Assault and battery, aggravated assault, attempt to- Well what about him? Murderin', robbin', horse thievin'. Be careful is all I'm sayin'. Careful? All these years we've been ridin' together, I've never heard you talk like- Don't get all mushy on me, Sheriff. I ain't talkin' about your health. I'm thinkin' about your job, my job. Just because some black-eyed... Black-eyed? Bloody-nosed jay hawker... Bloody-nosed? Jack Swanson came at me with a blade and weren't no butter-knife neither. Break, you used a fence-post on him. He had more than a black eye and a bloody nose. What was I supposed to do, let him stick me? Tread gently is all. Bonnie said you had it in you, lands and lovers and such. And such. You go around the back just in case he makes a run for it when the tickling starts. The tickling ain't what makes me nervous. Well, it should! Hello Bobby. Your mama teach ya how to fight? Don't you talk about my mama! What? He insulted my mother. You didn't even know your mama. All the more, Buge, all the more. Who sent ya? Nobody. Never heard of him. You ever heard of him? A Mr. Nobody. Hard to say. Oh heck, Buge, they say you're the brains of the outfit. I thought I was the looks. Up! You are the third tight-lipped bounty-hunter we've had to move out this month. There's something cookin' around here Buge. And it's making me hangry. You heard that carpetbagger. He's offering good, hard coin for The Saint. Dead or alive. Where's the Union now? Where's their promises? They ripped our world apart! Where's their promise of mercy? The Saint's been stealin' those promises. Breakin' it while they sit back gettin' fat on victory. My farm's in ashes. My kids is hungry. The Union's failed us again. It's on us, to take what's ours. Are you boys talkin' about The Saint? What's it to ya? Well, a friendly piece of advice, I would stay clear. Let the law work for ya. Not against ya. The law ain't feedin' my family! Neither are you, if you're dead. What'd you say? Is that a threat boy?! Come on down here and face us like a man or I'll shoot you- I'd lower that hammer before I drop mine. Uh-uh. DEPUTY SHANKS: You heard the deputy marshal, now drop it. Steer clear, boys, you've been warned. Jeremiah. Stay safe, fellas. No. Hmph. No. It's more like this. My son never had many friends. War will make 'em brothers before it's all over. Want any of this? Got it off a Georgia boy. I don't suppose that was an even trade? Spoils of war, brother. John? Hmm? I've seen you stare down a bear with only a round left in your chamber. I've seen you crack more skulls and break more bones than any man in the territory. I mean, you're as tough as they come. But when it comes to these gray backs... your sympathy concerns me. Well... that bear had it coming, he killed my dog. As for cracking and breaking something, I'd rather put something in a sling than in a grave. As for them... I believe in what we're fighting for. Doesn't mean I have to hate who I'm fighting against. Mm. Sound any good? Yeah. Keep it simple. Good guys in blue, bad guys in gray. Well, that's not how I see it. When this is over... If Davis and Lee and the rest of these guys aren't dancing at the end of a rope... I'm gonna pay old Honest Abe a visit myself. That talk brings trouble, Virg. Trouble can find me. John? You make 'em out? Too far. Oh. It's the marshal. Guess he heard about the fence post. Fence post? You sure it's him? Of course, I'm sure. Look at how he sits in that saddle. He rides like you. I look that good? What's that on his head? Is that a new hat? And a new deputy. Huh... How do you do, marshal? Mom, Sheriff. This is Deputy Shanks. Afternoon, ma'am. Deputy Shanks, call me Bonnie. It's a pleasure. And this is Sheriff Breaker. His daddy. Well, it's an honor, Sheriff. Shanks. You wouldn't happen to be kin to a Colonel Williford Shanks, would ya? Yes sir, that's my daddy. You're Willy's boy! I'll be. How is old guts n' glory doing? Uh, well... He actually passed last spring sir. Caught pneumonia. But he told me plenty of stories about you. Mostly from the war. He was a good man. You look a lot like him. Thank you, sir. Bugle. Marshal. You boys hungry? Can I put on a chicken? M'm... You've slaughtered enough chickens on my account. Whatever the Sheriff's having, that'd be fine. No, no, no; Those chickens have been thrivin' under my shadow too long. The only time I get a treat is when you show up. Bonnie, slaughter the fatted hen. The prodigal has returned. Fried chicken, then. M'm. I uh... suppose you heard about the whole fence post thing and Jack Swanson and all? I did. And I suppose that's why you're here. It's not. That lawyer had all the facts all twisted, he's making this whole stink about it. That guy had himself a knife. - Didn't he have a knife on him? - Sheriff... That is between you, him and the fence post. I am here on more prudent matters. He called me Sheriff again. Listen, son... If you're gonna stand on my property with that belly growlin' for one of my chickens, you'll call me dad, pa, father... Or if you're feeling especially tender, daddy. Done! I'm here on matters other than your fence post escapades. Escapades? He's back. Now have you seen this? No. If I knew where he was, I would've hunted and found him a long time ago. I know where he is. You think you do. I do. Even if you think you do, he's not gettable. Not just the two of you. Well, someone has to try. I have a warrant for his arrest. That's just a piece of rollin' paper to him. It is my duty to deliver that warrant and to bring him back. A warrant for The Saint? Well, whose boot did he spit on, because jayhawkers like that are small potatoes to the likes of Washington. There have been whispers... and rumors that have made it all the way to Washington. Rumors rubbed together don't make a warrant. We have information that him and his crew... they have been hitting reconstruction supply lines, raiding encampments, profiteering, leaving a mess wherever they hit! Taking supplies, women, leaving bodies! Now all that intel, that leads here. Kansas? You start flipping rocks over in Kansas, you're gonna find more desperate deserters than rattlesnakes. You're better off asking Grant for a regiment of expendables. The president? The government asked me. And now, I'm asking you. Wha- What? Well, why didn't you say that in the first place? I was trying to. The only thing is you would need to become my deputy. A deputy, Break. A deputy? Well, we would have to cross state lines. John... The Saint has been stirring up all kinds of trouble. Pickin' fights with deserters, bushwhackers, any southerner... that's paths he cross. The bounty is unwarranted and unsanctioned but... it is backed by rich investors and carpetbaggers. Bounty hunters from all over have been winding up dead. Everybody wants this reward but nobody can claim it. Carpetbaggers, banking bushwhackers. Trespassing bounty hunters. Bobby the bear. I told you somethin' was cookin'. You warned me, 100. This man wants war. If he can light a fire, he will. Now if the bushwhackers get him, then... But this man is living as if the war is still on. If he keeps going on the way that he is then... he could reignite the Civil War. Now hold on. The Saint's a slippery one. He's not gonna be stopped with a smile and a piece of paper. Then we bring him inthe hard way. Cut from the same cloth. Like wool, in summer. Alright... Show me something about his little group here. I'm not used to The Saint having a gaggle with him. This is Anvil. He can and will shoot you dead in a heartbeat. But he prefers to fight more personal. They say his fists might as well be horse hooves. Weapon of choice: Brass knuckles. I got it, don't get close. Easier said than done. Meet Holt. A hunter. You'll hear his gunshot before you see him comin'. Franklin York. We're being ambushed! Go, go, ride for help! One of the best snipers in the business. If he can see you in the distance, he can hit you. Claims that he's shot more than a dozen officers off their horses. Says he doesn't miss. Everybody misses. Who's next? George Washington, Jr. Claims he's the direct descendant of the president. Says if America was a monarchy he'd be king. Washington didn't have any kids. He didn't? Well, don't tell him that. Tucker Macready. He will kill anyone he sees as a rebel sympathizer. Aah!! They say he's the musician of the group and. The Saint's right hand man. And he is mean. Music, the great equalizer. Stacey Snyder. A girl. An unknown, a mystery, a liability. Pretty, but you'll hit the floor before you can say, "Miss." They say she holds her own though, against the rest of the bunch. Makes her scary enough for me. I don't ever remember having to fight no woman. That's because mom whooped you a long time ago. Well, maybe I should show these people how I curbed your teens over my knee. I don't fight my subordinates, Deputy Breaker. Deputy Breaker, Deputy... What's in a title? Just a word made up by some man sitting behind a desk. Besides... What better company for my compromise? And of course they are all led by Virgil. "The Saint." "We must extinguish our resentments... if we want harmony and union." Your newspaper's outdated. Where's the gold? I don't know what you're talking about. We were only transporting food and supplies to the starving in St. Louis. Kansas supplies for Missouri rebels. I swear. There's no money! I don't trust bushwhackers. I'm not a bushwhacker! I'm an officer of the Union army. I serve Bates Guard, sixth Missouri volunteer infantry! Bates Guard? Yes sir! I... I'm sorry, sir. Untie him. Have a seat. Have a seat, c'mon. You have any children? I got three boys. I had two sons. They used to help me run my spread, not too far from here actually. One of them decided he didn't like farming. Wanted to try his luck on the Mississippi. I condemned it, naturally. But I woke to find he took my best horse and my favorite gun and ran off, leaving me and my other son to run the place. On the eve of the war, he came back to me. Robbed, beaten, half starved. He came back to me with an apologetic grin, a smirk. He said... "I'm sorry, daddy. You were right." And I said, "I know." And shut the door in his face. George... OFFICER: Wait!! Wait!! We have to stomp out the rebellion. Please!! Smite it. No!!! Shut the door on it. George, okay. Wait!! It's in the wagon! Under the seat. Welcome to The Saint's restoration of the Union and the final annihilation of the Confederacy. Saddle up, boys! George, the door. John... I finally get to fix my mistake. This is a mistake. My two against all of them? Well, four. There's four, actually. My boys... both of you? Well, trouble halved is trouble shared. Don't sally me, John. I'm not your deputy. Look me in the eye. You've been dodging bullets your whole life. And now I can't help but feel you're stepping right into one. When you show a man mercy it becomes your responsibility. Surely there's someone else who can do this. No. I have to do this, Bonnie. No, you don't. You want to. And if you fail, that'll be why. Bonnie... Go back, retreat! Retreat, that's it boys, keep it moving! We've got 'em on the run! I got one! That's enough for today, son. Cal... Hold up, son. Stand guard. Jackpot. This gold watch will fetch a pretty penny. Maybe I'll even give it to you, son. Come on, dad, stop. What? You've taken enough. No!! Perkins. Cal, stand guard. Virgil, I'm so sorry. I never should've brought him. He fought for a good cause, Virgil. With honor. He fought because I made him. He's dead because I brought him. It should've been his brother. But he was there. And that's what matters. The cause was affected for the good because your son was part of it. And history will remember. The cause... History... He came for the adventure. I came to kill traitors. I'll bring you home, boy. Lay you next to your mother soon enough. As soon as I get that gray back that murdered you. I'll kill him, boy. I'll... I'll have justice. Virgil... that ain't justice. Red feather in his cap. Cocky, taunting red feather. I'll... find him. I'll find him if I have to pillage the whole rebel army. Grieve him, Virgil, fight for him. But don't dishonor him with revenge. Who up and made you preacher? Look who you're talking to. Look where I'm standing! Your boy knew what was right... he would've killed that Johnny. But you stopped him. My boy's dead because you stopped that bullet. His blood cries for revenge! Maybe it's yours that should be taken. Hold it, Buge. Virgil... Dad... It's alright, Cal. I'm sorry boy. Take it. He'd want you to... keep practicing. You're pretty good at that tin sandwich. You think if Perkins was still alive The Saint would've turned out the same? I think The Saint was broke before the war even started. There was bad brewing in him for a long time. I think when his son died, that dam broke. No, I don't think The Saint's son was bad. But I think the father would've forced him there eventually. You see, daddies have a way of doing those things. Shaping a thing. So you shaped me, huh? Well, not to the caliber that you've become. But I think mama and me, we lit some kindling. But you stoked that fire all by yourself, senator. Oh, I know. Come on... Oh, well, war hero. Law school, marshal. Going after the number one criminal this side of the Ohio. Dad. You haven't shown any interest in. The Saint till it caught the eye of Washington. I ain't condemning you, I get it. Small potatoes. But let this be a lesson to you. Small things, grow. Let's just worry about getting The Saint. We'll think about the becomings, after. I can't help but wonder what it would've been like if I hadn't let him go. Well, he was your friend. No, he wasn't. Just because you know a man doesn't make him your friend. What was the story with that fence post? Good night, Cal. Good night! Good night. I will be back. Both of you. Hyah, hyah! The Saint stole our food, stole our lives. And this reward will give it all back! I want you to think of your wives; Think about your sister. Think about your children. This time tomorrow, our problems are over! This time tomorrow there'll be justice for our fallen brothers. That's right! This time tomorrow we'll be rich! Kill him, hang him dead. Somebody gets between you and The Saint... They're standin' between you and your family, you and your lives! Let's fight for the fallen! Let's ride! Let's make some money. Alright, let's get him. Saddle up boys! Yeah, let's go! What you readin'? Nothin'. Uh-huh. Sonnets. Who? Shakespeare. Shakespeare? Poetry. Oh... Huh. You know... I wrote a poem once. What, you? JOHN: Uh-huh. When I first met your mama. Wow, I am surprised I was even born. Yeah, I can be artistic too when I want to be. Yeah. With a fence post. You're lucky I'm layin' down! Yeah, yeah. My watch. Sleep tight, boys. Night. Mama know? What, about the sonnets? About the girl. I would feel like picking with the barrage of questions she would come at me with. No, I have not told anybody. You know, new canteens are cheap. So is life. Yours was almost bought with a tiny piece of lead. Old things like this always remind me to pray for the better angels. Get some sleep. Nothing gets past ol' Buge. I don't think I've ever seen him sleep a wink. I bet he would stay out there all night if you asked him to. Looks all quiet to me. Shanks, how long have you been marshaling for? Since the war. What made you choose this line of work? Best legal way to keep the juices flowing, I suppose. It's kinda hard to go back to being a clerk once you've dealt in bullets, know what I mean? Yeah. I suppose I do. My dad did. He went right back behind the counter selling pickled eggs and candy sticks. I couldn't though. You know there are two types of men who come in and out of war. Those who fight because it's their duty like your daddy. Then go home and shed the memories with their uniform. And then there are those who fight because they're fighters, and there's always something that needs to be fought. It takes both types. Good night boys. Hyah! Hyah! We're getting pretty deep into Kansas now boys. Are you sure you know where The Saint is? Just relax back there, old man. The trail leads that way. But that's towards the Abington place. Why would they go through the Abington place? Something ain't right. I'm gonna go check it out. - Cal! - Hyah! Ah... stubborn. Something wrong, Sheriff? Your daddy used to get these feelings before a battle or a march, you know about those? Yeah, I get 'em at home too when something's off, or about to happen. How are you feeling? Like we're being watched. Uh-huh... yeah. I missed your daddy the last couple of years. Yeah, I miss him too. He talked about you all the time during the war. It was hard for him fighting against ya. Every prisoner we'd catch, he'd always ask them if they knew ya. It's an honor ridin' with ya. I hope I don't disappoint you, sir. Nah, you won't. They're there. And the Abingtons? Fresh graves in the back. There's a girl. JOHN: Abby? She was running water from the well... she's alive. So, this is it. You hang a man for avenging his son? What's the plan, Marshal? Ride around the tree line and come around back, and you cut their horses loose. If you see them run out, give them light. Bugle, stay just out of the line of fire. If there's trouble, run and get help. Sheriff. Or we deliver the warrant. Hup! Hyah! Company. My name is Cal Breaker, and I am a U.S. Marshal. Howdy. Is Mr. Abington here? Yeah, he's around. One of the... twins could take you to him. Heh. Easy, Cal. You ever grab a rattler by the nose? Grab those reins, and you'll find out. That's right. You're in no position to make threats, law dog. Virgil! Virgil, come on out! John Breaker. Virg. It always makes me smile to see you, John. I wish I felt the same, Virg. The last time I saw you, you were fitting me for a noose. If memory serves, you deserved it. Are you here to see the uh... Abingtons. Yeah, are you here to see them? Because they ain't here. Hmm. Looks like you made yourself at home. I know you ain't here on official business, because last time I checked, the state line ended over yonder and so does your jurisdiction. Mine did... his didn't. Cal? Virgil. Well... this boy he... he was friends with my boy during the war. It's good to see you, Cal. It's "Marshal" now. Marshal? Good for you, good for you, heh. What can I do for you, Marshal? We have got a warrant for your arrest. Yeah? I don't think so, Cal. It's nice of you boys to stop by. Goodbye, John. We ain't goin' without ya, Virg. Trouble's coming and it's got your name all over it. Wouldn't you rather see this through with some friends? Are we still friends, John? We can do this easy, Virg. Ain't nothin' easy. Bugle still fighting your wars for you? Holt! She makes a mean cobbler. Are you okay, Abby? What are the odds of you knowing them? They used to live just north of Linn Creek. - Well, then... - Get, get, get! I guess you already know all about the cobbler. Now as much as I like cobbler, Virg... you know how Bonnie gets if I ruin her dinner. Pace you're marchin, ya gonna miss more than supper. It's more than you'll get hangin from a bushwhacker's tree. Their trees or your gallows, it makes no difference to me. Listen, Virg- No you listen, John! You take your Marshal-boy, and you go across that line. And you forget you ever knew me! Not his call, it's mine. Back a bear in his own den, boy... you'll find out what happens. I know what happens... you smoke him out. We were brothers once. I'm gonna give you one last chance. Take your boy home. Don't make the same mistake I did. Holt! Tucker! Hey. JOHN: Cal. Hey! Hey! - Cal, don't. - - Hey! Everybody stop. Aw, heck. Hyah! Yah! Fence post! Yah! Gentle justice. They got Bugle! Did he hit the ground? - What? - Did he fall from his horse? No. Ah! Cal!!! Cal, go! Go! Go, Cal! Go! Go, go! Get in! You ain't gonna bring 'em back doing stuff like that! They got Shanks. Ain't nothin' you can do about that right now. They killed him. We all knew the risks. What kind of excuse is that? Cal! He died fighting for a cause. That's all any fighter can ever ask for. You going back out there and getting yourself killed ain't gonna help him now. How about Bugle? He was your friend. You said he didn't fall off his horse, right? Yeah. I know my friend. You should have killed Virgil when you had the chance. Well let me tell ya what redemption looks like... I never found you, and I never see you again. You go West and start yourself a new life, Virgil. You ready to move? We gotta hold up until we get reinforcements. How long is that gonna be? Well, it'll take Bugle 2 hours to get to town; 2 hours to posse up and about 5 hours to get back in the dark. So until dawn? I ain't waitin' that long. - Hey Breaker... Breaker. - Yeah? We've got trouble. Yeah. He left last night right past the pickets. They're calling him a deserter. We both know what he went to do. The Captain's looking for him. They'll want me to bring him back. He who walks with the wise becomes wise, but a companion to fools suffers harm. They're gonna hang him, aren't they, dad? I know why me, but why you? Foolish or wise... I'm your companion. Here's to harm. I'm comin' with ya. Not this time. Dad? You're staying. It's safer here. But it's not safe anywhere, and I wanna be with you. I said you're staying. If you die for your country, so be it. But I'm not letting you die for The Saint. Let's go. They got us pinned, Cal. Looks like we're staying here tonight. Heya... do you think they'll run? No. Do you think they'll hurt the girl? I don't know. Shh. - What are you doing? - Shh. Hey! I hit him, you cuff him. This is that jayhawker Jeremiah's outpost. I'll see who sneaks up on who this time. Turn back. Go home. Under whose authority? Mine. The Marshal done warned you with his mouth. Now I'm warning you with my gun. It's just you, huh? Look at you sittin' there all fancy pointin' your pistol at me while The Saint runs free starving my kids. Raiding my land. I'm gonna count to three. One... Two... Three. Grab his horse. We'll get to the Abington Ranch before sundown. There ya go. The Saint's gonna get you! No, he's not. Watch her. Make sure she doesn't move. Hey, John! What? I'm giving you the one last chance you once gave me. You can leave here now, and I'll let you go. With you in tow? You're a stubborn man. Yep. So what'll it be? I'll wait. To meet your maker? Maybe. If we're gonna meet our maker... it's not gonna be from starvation. We've got their provisions, take a look. Looks like a dadgum general store in here let's eat! John Breaker. Look, why don't we just run? They ain't gonna catch us! Because of what's in the barn. There's always more loot, boss. Not the loot... Breaker! We can get away and regroup and gather more men. This ends today. I don't see no point in going out there to die. Do you wanna spend your life lookin' over your shoulder? You ready? Aye. If she moves, kill her. You got it, boss. Hey, hey... what is that? Uh-huh. Is she pretty as your mama? She's beautiful. You live a dangerous life son, is she okay with that? Yeah, she's fine. Well. We both know that mom is a strong woman... but my life and my choices haven't always been easy on her. A lot of late nights wonderin' if I was comin' home on a saddle or in a box. She's fine. Cal! Are you alright? Yeah, no holes. Desperation? Diversion. Anvil's on the run. You take the back, I'll take the front. Ready? Go! John Breaker... the only man alive who could give my boss the quickstep. Tucker Macready... don't make me shoot a musician; The world needs as many as it can get. I believe I got you- There's always another way. Really? Always? How've you been? I've been busy. Come here. The Saint is gonna kill you. I heard that one already. Is this your idea of gentle justice? Dad, hey this is the girl I was telling you about. Stacey Snyder. I've heard a lot about you, sir. She works for the government. Her intel is what helped us get the warrant. And you're... you're okay with her being a... Spy? No offense, sheriff- Deputy. No offense. I've been working southern celebrations and Confederate inaugurations since before Sumter. Your mama's gonna love her! What if I had shot her?! Now come on, you're not gonna shoot a girl. You can hardly look at her. Alright, you two lovebirds... let's end this. The Saint's not getting away this time. Alright... I'll busy him in the front. You go around left, and come in through the back. It'll be just like Bull Run. You ready, Miss Snyder? Yep. JOHN: Ready, son? Ready. Good. The odds have shifted, Virgil. You're outnumbered. How do you wanna play it? I'm glad it's you, John... but you're gonna have to kill me this time. Oh! Morning, boys. Was it worth it, Virg? I'm glad it's you they sent, John. I'm not. I lost my boy, John. It's got to count for something. You've got a boy. You understand. They'll understand. You disobeyed orders. You left without leave. You put yourself above the Army. That's called desertion. It was justice! It was war! How many sons did you take in Petersburg? How about Bull Run? While you were out there trying to even the score, you put a price on all of us. Oh, it's easy for you to talk like that. Your boy is still breathing. And you stayed the bullet that killed mine. If it had been your boy that had been buried, I'd have understood. Help! Someone shot Timmy! I guess I was followed; Your choice... fight or flight? They've gotta be close. Over here! I see them! Go! Go, Cal! Go! You're late. I thought you said like Bull Run? You were late then too. I'm coming out! It's over, Virg... let her go. You're in no position to negotiate. You're gonna kill an innocent girl? I'll do what I have to to protect the Union. No, you'll do what you have to for revenge. Their treachery is unforgivable! No, you think your son abandoning you is unforgivable. You think the war taking your other boy is unforgivable. Put your guns down! - I'll shoot her. - You're not gonna shoot her Virg. She doesn't deserve it. You're broken... and you're bad... but you ain't evil, Virg. Let her go. You're right. I won't shoot her. Drop it! Drop it! The traitor too! Good girl. Put your gun down. Put your gun down! A son for a son. Now you know what it feels like. Cal! Take it easy... easy. Are you okay? Howdy. We's here for a reckonin'. Ah, ah, ah... drop it. Cal, keep your finger in it. We don't want ya to bleed out. Dad, I'm fine. Stay with him. What? I said stay with him. Where is he? Ah! Whoa now. That man is ours, sheriff. I've got a warrant for this man's arrest. Oh, that had to hurt! Oh! Alright, let's wrap it up, boys. I said he's ours, sheriff. Do it! Kill me. Dead or alive, it don't matter to us. You heard 'em... kill me! John, kill me. I shot your son. So this is it? Hang a man for avenging his son? Well, from where I'm standing you get two choices... the reckoning, or the redemption. The reckoning? The reckoning is what that Reb got for murdering my boy. Well let me tell you what redemption looks like... I never found you, and I never see you again. You go West and you start yourself a new life, Virgil. I'll give it to ya if you'll take it. So you're judge and jury? And executioner. They told me don't bother bringing you back, just find a tree and drop you. But I know something they don't... you deserted, but you're not a deserter. You're just selfish. So... there's two roads. The easy one is the reckoning. The right one is redemption. What's it gonna be, Virg? You're under arrest. The court will decide your fate. Mercy?! I spared you once because of pity... mercy? Ain't nothin' gentle about mercy. Go on, I'm taking him in. You're outside your jurisdiction, sheriff. You ain't nothin' but a man outgunned. You're on the wrong side of justice, boys. Don't test me; Not today. Oh yeah? Whatcha gonna do? Huh? Forgive us if we don't oblige... come on. Oh, I'll forgive ya... after I'm done with ya. Heh... us versus you? Andthem. I got no problem taking you too. The choice is yours. - Hyah! - That's what I thought. It's about time. Most men wouldn't make it 'til dawn. Well thankfully, you ain't most men. They shot a Deputy Marshal on the road. Do you want me to ride after them? Send the boys. Cal's been hit. Get up. Whoa. Hold off. Move! Not like this. I said not like this. My father... my brother... Abby- You spared him! Shh, he's going to court, Abby. And this time he'll hang. Not this time. Take him away, boys. He deserved to hang. I know. Then why didn't you? If it were my son who were shot and killed... I'd probably have done the same. No, you wouldn't. Look at you all gussied up from your court date! Bugle told me the verdict. Umm-hmm. I got you this as a reminder... it's a little less morbid. I like it. You sure you don't wanna stay a while longer? Well, I gotta get back to Washington, and report on The Saint's trial. Back to Washington. We're proud of you. We did it. Yes we did. And it was a pleasure getting to know you. The pleasure was mine, sheriff. - Dad. - What? Wait what? - Keep us posted! - A wedding? Don't wait too long. Campaign season's coming. What are you gonna do? Run against me? Oh, I ought to just to have the pleasure of ordering you around again. Dad, you'll always be above my rank in this county. You take care of him. We take care of each other. BUGLE, V/O: There's a fight inside of men as well. A fight against a reckoning. A reckoning of all the things we've done... or didn't do. My granddaddy... he called it a warrant. And he warns that at some point... it hunts after us all. Sometimes to reckon... always to redeem.
