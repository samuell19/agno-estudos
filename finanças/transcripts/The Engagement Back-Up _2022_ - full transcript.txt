What will you see? Lighthouses, shipwrecks, whaling boats. Gold coast millionaires commuting on high-speed yachts. Our waterways have shaped our history for over 500 years and it's all here. Sometimes people turn up late for the tour. So, I just thought I'd get it started. Fake it till you make it, right? That woman from the Discovery Council is here for you. Would you mind telling her I'm busy with the tour? Yeah. Any bill you send us is just an estimate entitling us, therefore, to estimate what we would like to pay you. Good. Sure. Come and fit the new meter whenever you'd like. Fake it till you make it. That rep, he left this for you. This was my father's dream. I would never turn a private museum over to some educational conglomerate. But really, what am I gonna do? I'm doing one of the exercises in my Live Your Dream Life book and I suddenly see it so clearly. What if we opened this place up to events? Well, that's why I've spent the last two years courting Imogene Heron. I really think if she gave a history talk here it would draw a crowd. That's not that kind of event. I took the liberty of writing up a blurb. "With nautical treasures transporting your guests" "through local coastal history, this magical wedding destination is a hidden gem." With the rental fee from weddings alone, in just six months, we'll be in the black. What would I know about weddings? My father ran a history museum, not a wedding factory. What if people spill champagne on the books or walk past the exhibits without even reading them? Just weekends, and spring and summer. If I were getting married, maybe I'd think about doing it here. But what's the appeal if you're not a history buff? Wait. So, you do think about getting married? Like, in the distant, distant future. But you've thought about it? I don't have time to think about love when I have grant applications to write. A business to maintain. Love just isn't important right now. But what if love could save your business? My dad trusted me with this place. It was his baby. You knew my dad. What do you think he would think about all the hoopla? I think he would have wanted you to be able to pay the museum's water bill. I know. I know. You know what? Let's do it. Let's make this place some money. We'll just have really strict rules about what people can and cannot touch. Really? This is awesome! We're manifesting. But I'm not giving up on Imogene Heron. Of course not. Jackson Valentine, you don't need to creep around like a ninja. I told you he's in meetings till 4:00PM. I don't see the point in avoiding Dad, by the way. I just don't want to upset him. I think it's better if he doesn't see me until this all blows over. You left to set up a rival company. That's not exactly the kind of thing that vanishes on the wind. It's not a rival company. I told you this. It's just a side thing where I can take on some of the projects that I'm more passionate about. I need to get out into the world and make a difference. And yet, here you are. Yeah, right, ok. Well, maybe, you know, being in the investment world has taught me that if you want to make a difference, you need relationships. You want the upcoming board seat? Why? Why? Why is because there are hundreds of nonprofits that could do so much more if they had a bit more funding. I mean, this one, for example. Ocean Can, they use technology to help clean the oceans. It's brilliant. So you'd use your status to vote to fund projects like that one? All the power of being on staff here at Valentine Holdings without having to be on staff here at Valentine Holdings. Or, you could just have an actual conversation with our father and influence the direction of the company the old-fashioned way. Come on. Breakfast with Dad is not gonna get him to listen. He risks becoming obsolete. So, what do you say? Do you want to influence the future of Valentine Holdings? Yes. One down, four to go. Ok, I gotta get moving 'cause I only have 10 days until vote. I'll see ya. Posts that include images produce 650 percent higher engagement than text alone. Put it on. Me? I'm not wearing that thing. Where did you even get that? It's my cousin's. I picked it up from the bridal store for her this weekend and it's been in my trunk. She won't mind. Ah! - Good. - I feel so awkward. Does it look weird? No. Ok, look out to sea like you're contemplating your new life together. This is for the museum. Yes. Over the shoulder. Hey, hey, hey, come on. Look, not today, I'm over here, I'm working. What paper are you from? You know what, actually, can we just, let's just delete these because there's- Oh, no, sorry. Uh, you think... It's not what you think. Please don't! Hey, what's going on? Wow. Oh, my gosh! I just deleted your wedding photographs. You deleted them? I have to take all those pictures again? I am so sorry. I, I thought you were, well I mean, I thought that she was and then I, I didn't realize. Do those, um, automatically back up, like to the cloud or anything you take them? Uh, wow. I feel terrible. You know what? Why don't I pay for it. Or, better yet, I can get another photographer out here and we can have two going at once, that way you can get back to your, your guests sooner. Thank you, no. I'll continue using this one. It's Jackson Valentine. Look, I, I, I really don't want a press leak. I mean, if people get their hands on this before I get my presentation, we could lose momentum, the whole thing could fall through. It's, it's for the Ocean Can. Did you know that we are dumping the equivalent of a garbage truck full of plastic into the ocean every single minute? You don't have to tell me about the ocean. I love the ocean. I'm the ocean's best friend. I run that maritime museum, over there. Then I guess you know that only nine percent of plastic gets recycled? That's actually not, well, it's mine, but... It wasn't personal. A lot of folks are misinformed. Oh, I am the Queen of information. So, thank you for your concern, but I've got this, all of this. Good luck with your garbage cans. Ok. Congratulations and please give my regard to the very lucky Mr. Maritime Museum. Thank you. What? That was Jackson Valentine! Let's go. I can't believe you don't recognize him. He's from one of the richest families, not just on the bay, but in the world. He's always in the papers and on social media. It's actually the opposite of famous. No one really knows you, but they think they do. Well, it seems like he does a lot of good. Digging house foundations in Sri Lanka, rescuing sloths in Costa Rica. And his passion project, cleaning up the oceans. Apparently, just one of those cans removes half a ton of ocean debris a year. It all comes down to doing the simple things. Just a little bit differently. And, he's a bachelor. Surprise, surprise. Not the playboy kind. A total class act. Into women for their minds. Look. No plans to marry. No, we just, we enjoy each other's company. And who wouldn't love listening to her and Julie's ideas. Ok, enough with the celebrity stalking. Where's the press release? Are you crazy? When did you take that? Why did you take that? He was in that nice suit and you were in the dress and you looked like a couple. It's for our vision board. What vision board? It's how you manifest. It says so in the book. So... "The secret to getting your dream life is "to live like you already have it. "What does success look like to you?" "Be specific." Who is this Erica Rosario anyway? Come on. Let's get that press release out. Yeah. But we're still manifesting. Done! Oh. Uh-oh. Luna... Yes? I may have accidentally sent out the save the date I made for our vision board. You mean your vision board? I'm so sorry. Erica Rosario said to save it in a place you always see it. Every day. So, it was on my desktop. Who did we send this to? Just our publicity list. So, journals, bloggers, media types. Not Nolan Elias. Please tell me not Nolan Elias? Nolan Elias. No! He's the best journalist in the country. Now he'll never take me seriously. How do we retract it? I can recall the email if they haven't opened it. Except, a lot of people just opened it. Angelina: Is Jackson Valentine in? Yes, it's urgent. Angelina Robinson. What's it about? His engagement. Another delivery. Hello? Hello! Here you go. I correct it, but it just keeps coming back like a mosquito. And every time I try to reach his assistant, his people think I'm some gossip columnist trying to get an interview. I swear, the paparazzi followed me here. We need him to make a statement before this place turns into a garden centre. You know how my Uncle Lou is a livery driver out of Hayworth Airport? Well, one of the guys he works with told my cousin Joey that he once picked up the sister from this private jet that landed out there. And drove her back to this mansion in Edgeport. You sure you don't want to just see if he'd be up for marrying you? Staff member: May I help? Yes, hi. We have a meeting to discuss your publicity needs. Fake it till you make it. Staff member: I'm sorry, but we're not expecting anyone. I'm not dealing with these people. Are you sure? Because the person I arranged it with was very interested in the little publicity problem you're having concerning a certain black sheep with the supposed sheep's fiancée. Thank you. I am so glad you're here. You are? Oh yeah, our communications platforms are great but nothing beats the real thing. Exactly. Give me a handwritten letter any day. You're much more positive about this than I expected. Well, unlike my father I am very positive about the direction we're moving. So, we just need you to make an official statement of retraction. Of retraction? No, no, no, no. We don't retract now. We don't? Think of this as a slow roll out. You know, we let the story build momentum because, at the end of the day, we want people to know who you are, because what you do, it's amazing. It is a very special business. But shouldn't we do something about the engagement? Engagement? Is that a sort of new trendy term for funding a start-up? Yeah, I guess theoretically we are, yeah, sure, we're engaging in your, in your bus... What a minute, are you Miss Maritime? Yes! I mean, no. But, yes. I thought you looked familiar, I just couldn't place you from where. You're missing the gown and where's Mr. Maritime? There is no Mr. Maritime. Well, I mean, you're Mr. Maritime. Right. We were manifesting with a photoshoot. We want to start hosting weddings. Live your dream life. It really works. She attached the wrong file. So we were hoping you'd write a statement. Just to clear the air. I was wondering why you were plastering this picture of us everywhere. Oh, it wasn't me. That's why we wanted you to step in. You have a lot of followers. And we wanted publicity but not this kind of publicity. No, you're right. You're right. I mean, I mean with my current business affairs, it's best just to kill a frivolous story like this before it gets out of hand, so I will let my publicist know and it will be gone. I mean, I wouldn't call it completely frivolous. Ok, sorry, not, not frivolous, just, it's a little out there. Oh, yes. It's out there. For someone as special and revered as you to be paired up with someone like me. Yeah. I'll let you issue the statement. I have to go help our lowly team of commoners sweep the floor of our shabby museum. I'd say more quaint than shabby, but I love this. - Thank you. - It's just... Ok. Voicemail: You have one new voice message. Hi, I'm looking for Luna. It's Nolan Elias from the Island Post Magazine. I can't believe you're getting married to Jackson Valentine. Congratulations. Anyway, I thought there might be a story there with you doing it at the museum. Take care! Oh. Such a shame. Too bad for the best journalist, my imaginary wedding isn't actually happening. Or, imagine the real publicity. Our own father is refusing to endorse me. You had to know that? Of course I knew that, but I didn't know that you were counting on Dad's vote. Why would our father vote for you when you've shown absolutely no interest in the future of this company? The ideas I'm proposing would bring us into the future. Doesn't come across that way. Why? Because I'm not in some perfect relationship or I don't have a little electric toothbrush thinga-ma-bobs dangling out of my ears? You know what? I have to admit, I agree with Dad. But the only person who seems to matter to you is you. You have no interest in inheriting this company and passing it on to your children. You're this rogue bachelor with rogue ideas and it would take a PR miracle for you to change your image and sway Dad's or anyone else's vote. Wow. Ok, thank you, sis. No, no, no. Actually, thank you. Yeah. Thank you, thank you! Nice to see you again, Nolan. You too, Luna. So this is the museum. So, what do you think? You could focus on how the old boathouse was gonna be demolished and my dad and his friends formed the Preservation Society. Which later became this museum. Or the pirate exhibition is always a crowd pleaser. And the wedding? Oh. Like I said over the phone, there is no engagement. But the museum, you said you'd love to check it out. I thought you could still run a piece on it. Yeah, sorry, Luna. I wish I could but it's just not the kind of thing my editor would go for. I know you said you're retracting your press release, but I see that all the time with society pages. Secret weddings, someone leaks an invitation, or the bride is marrying into that world and has no idea about keeping on the down low so she retracts. Nope. Just me. And these old boats. Luna, I just got a call from... Oh, he's here. Hey, honey. How are you? - Hey! - Hey. Nolan Elias. Been a minute. Good to see you, bud. It has. Wow, well, I trust you heard the news. She's a keeper, this one. I was just saying to Nolan there is no wedding. - Is that what she told you? - Yeah. - Come on. - I did wonder. It would make a great story. Jackson Valentine. The world has been waiting for him, for you, to settle down. Well, isn't it about time they knew that I was capable of it. Would you excuse us a minute? Just a second. What are you doing? Ok, hear me out. You said that you could use the publicity, right? And I could use a bit of a public image overhaul. We can't just pretend we're engaged. Why not? Let this guy write his story, it gets published, we both get what we want and then we have a very public break up. Boom. Even more publicity, right? This is completely unethical. I know this reporter. He's an old friend of mine. Then you can tell your old friend afterward. Luna, this is the way of the world. Not my world. As far as I can see, your world might not exist in a couple weeks without a mega publicity push. There are other ways. Well, I think that a million Jackson Valentine followers say this is a pretty good one. What do you say? Will you marry me? Get up! Get up! Fine. But just until the article comes out. And until then we don't tell a soul. Deal. Oh, so sorry about that. My fiancée needed some convincing. She's not used to the limelight. - Mom. - Fiancée? You're engaged? It's, uh, ok, Mom. You don't have to keep it secret anymore. She's so loyal. Fiercely loyal. Right. What a relief to say it out loud. My future son-in-law is Jackson Valentine. Mom. Oh, it's so good to see you. How are you? So, you'll do the article? Better. We'll do an exclusive. Super. Why don't we sit down sometime next week? Sounds great. A weekend feature on us. - Wow. - Wow. Wow. I bet everyone's dying for the inside scoop. Maybe you can fill me in over lunch? Garlic knots from Sunflower, Chicken Francese, arancini... Mom. Stop. Stop what? I'm putting out the food. Jackson, you have to try some. It's the best. We go there once a week. I know you're mad. You're doing the food thing. When she talks about food and won't look you in the eye. Hm. I'm not mad. I guess, when you're dating a celebrity you have to have your secrets. Blood is thicker than water. I would have thought you could at least tell me. I'm good at keeping secrets. Look how good I played along with that reporter. Mom, it's not like that. I don't see what else it could be. When your own daughter doesn't say a word about her secret life. Granted, I was out of town with Dominic. Out of sight out of mind, I guess. Oh, you know, uh, it's, it's all my fault. Actually, you know, she, she wanted to tell you. In fact, she begged me to let her tell you but we wanted to wait until lobster night. Yeah, when we would just tell everyone as one big family. Lobster night? Yeah. You know how much I love lobster. This is wonderful. My baby's getting married! Oh, I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Let's eat, let's eat, let's eat! Thank you, again, for all the food, Mrs. Morelli. Oh, please. Call me mom. I'll see you both at lobster night! Woo! Lobster night? Yeah, what? Isn't that what you nautical types do? We agreed this was going no further than you, me and Nolan Elias. Wait, then why did you encourage me to bring my parents into it? When did I do that? When you were doing the whole like, mm... If you got off your phone and spent more time interacting with actual humans, you might be better at reading eyebrows. Look, could you not see that her heart was shattering into a million pieces on the museum floor? 'Cause her only daughter got engaged without sharing it with her. Ok, but I think I came up with the perfect excuse. Plus, wouldn't it look a little suspicious if my own parents didn't know about our engagement? Fine. Your parents and then no one else. Ok. And your job is...? CEO I guess? You taking notes? Just being prepared. How long would you say we've been together? Four months. You think you'd know me well enough to marry me after just four months? I think I would know after four minutes, if I had a future with someone. After four minutes, yeah. Are you sure this isn't going a little far? Can you even return an engagement ring? They're expensive. I know, but what's the first thing that someone does when a woman says she's engaged. They look at her hand. Don't you think a real ring takes it to another level? I hear you. I do, but would not having a ring bring up even more questions? Which would lead to even more lies. We, we want to be convincing, right? I guess a ring keeps it simple. Yeah. Well, if it isn't the most beautiful young lady on the island and her fiancé. You know how it works is you buy the ring before you propose? Oh, well look, sometimes the spirit moves you and you don't have all your ducks in a row. Yeah. Hi Dominic. How are you? Jackson, this is Dominic, my mom's... I'm the famous boyfriend. You know, she doesn't want to meddle, but before you splash out here, I know your mother has an idea. Mom, I can't. You must. No, Mom. It's yours. I want you to have it. I've had a few years to think about this and I told myself, if she ever gets married, I want her to wear this. What good is it doing me? Dad gave it to you, Mom. Sweetie, I haven't worn it in years. You should have it. And come on, you love old things. I said no. This is about Dominic, isn't it? You've never warmed to him. You know, he's been very good to me. It's not about him. Why do you always bring Dominic into things that are between you and me? You just don't get it. This is important. This is serious. Look, Mom, it's not real. Of course it's real, it's platinum. No, I mean our love. Jackson and me. Nonsense. Look, I know you like your privacy and I've been trying to respect that and give you your space, but you can't dismiss what you're feeling just because other people want to share in your joy. This is a time for family and we are all we have. It's beautiful. They demolished the old lighthouse and the boat yard was next. But, my dad organized local residents. Wow. They fought and won. Good for them. They set up a preservation society, which later became the museum. Huh. Do you want a pen? What for? To write this down. No, it's all up here. So, if Nolan asks you anything about where I'd rather be, this is it. We have some original newspapers dating back to 1851. Did you ever think of updating? I mean, you can get this whole collection put on a server, and... And whatever we couldn't source, we managed to get on microfiche. Microfiche? Yeah, it's like a scanned image of a newspaper or a picture of the original document. I know what it is. Wait, they still do that? In the 21st century? Not every archive has had the ability to convert their film to digital images. All I can say is thank goodness. Can you believe someone wanted to throw these away? No. Yeah. I rescued them from a local library. Wow. You really do love microfiche. I could do this all day. But we won't, right? We'll just kind of... I'm joking. You know what? I've got a museum to run. Well you, you want me to read all this? This is my passion. You can't be my fiancé without knowing my passion. Ok. Well then it's only fair that you know mine. Come on. Dig in. You're scared to get your hands dirty? What do we have here? So, how did you become an ocean crusader? Same as a lot of things I support. It all started by watching a couple really powerful documentaries. It went from there. I've never really liked the attention that I got from being a Valentine. Then I realized that you can use it as a commodity. You can use it to do things. Ideally, meaningful things. Must be pretty tough for you to live a normal life. People seem to be more intrigued whenever there is a pretty woman around. Are there a lot of pretty women? No, there are not. Too busy to settle down? No, just haven't found the right woman to settle down with. I never really felt like anyone was gonna make a better man out of me. What about you? You ever have time to tear yourself away from the paper mites? Running the museum takes up most of my time. I mean, I dated on and off. The truth is, I haven't really wanted anything to come of it. Ever since my dad died three years ago, I don't think my heart could handle it if something didn't work out. The necklace. He has the other one. Two ships, he used to say. We just didn't have long enough. I'm really sorry about your dad. Thanks. Hey, question for you as president of the so important that you need ear thingies society. I'm listening, on my ear thingies, in fact. Of course. Do you think that the end always justifies the means? Like in business, I mean. Well, that depends on the means. If the deal looks good and it's for a good cause, yeah, I'm open to shades of grey. Why? What's happening with your Ocean Can, is it drifting out to sea? Uh, yeah, I mean, you know how these things can go. So listen, can you pick up some lobsters for tomorrow night? Jackson Valentine, what are you up to? Nothing. I just want to have a nice dinner. Ok, you haven't had dinner with Mom and Dad in three months and now suddenly you want to join us for lobster night? Is this part of your get Dad to vote for me plan? No, of course not. I just... I've got something on my mind. I'm intrigued and excited to see you. Dad'll be over the moon. No, no, no. Don't tell anyone. Just keep it a secret. So, lobsters? Maybe some corn. Get your own corn. That is some house. Don't fawn over them. And don't get too chatty. We're staying for an hour, max. Who's fawning? He's just making an observation. And remember to act surprised. You know, all you need is one of those big yellow rubber raincoats like the guy on the fish stick box and you'd be ready for the rough seas. You said lobster night. This is what you wear to lobster night. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look at this place. No wonder your sister requested lobster. - What a lovely surprise. - Hi Mom. Did somebody say surprise? You know, yes. I actually have an announcement to make. This is Luna, my fiancée. What a surprise! Ohh! Uh, well, congratulations. Thanks, Mom. You look so familiar. Does she? I get that a lot. How did you two meet? - On the docks. - Outside my museum. By the docks right outside my museum. Luna runs a Maritime museum. She's actually written a book about our local history. Oh, I'd love to read it. I head up our publishing division. We started with e-books but these days three-quarters of our titles go to print. Sure, maybe. When it's finished. Well, I think a toast is in order. Yes, a toast to the surprising turn of events. Yes, to the first step on the road to being a family man. I bet you never thought you'd see the day. Well, frankly, I... To Luna and Jackson. Yes. You can almost see the old lookout from here. My dad was heartbroken when they demolished the old lighthouse. So, he petitioned the town to mark the spot where it stood. Part of the deal was once a month they'd cast a light in the old lookout to honor the way the lighthouse used to help guide ships home. Of course ships couldn't always trust them. Yes. There were folks known as the "wreckers". The most famous one being? Jeremiah Smith. Legend has it, he'd build these huge fires on the beach that ships would mistake for a lighthouse. Luring them ashore, so when they get stuck on the sandbar, he'd run out to help them. Or so they thought. And steal their goods? The cheek! He might be an urban myth though. I like the theory that he was real but not the worst of them. Just got the most publicity. Sounds familiar. Whatever the truth is, I still believe you can trust a lighthouse to help guide you home. How do you know so much about the wreckers? Oh, that lighthouse was part of our view here for years and when they wanted to shut down the old boathouse, we did some work with the preservation society. So did my dad. Gus wouldn't back down to those developers. I have some vintage postcards that I can part with for your museum. They're very rare. I... I couldn't possibly. Of course you can. Consider them an engagement gift. Um, I should go. But we're all having such a nice time. I just remembered that I have to paint one of the exhibition spaces. We didn't even get to hear how Jackson proposed. It's really not that exciting of a story. Totally, ho-hum. I didn't even have a ring. - This one's my mom's. - Yeah. Doesn't it look great on her? Come on, tell us. We'd love to know. Uh, ok. Well, I proposed using a clam shell. You know how I like my nautical stuff. Yep. Really? You know what, Posey, Luna and I have been talking. We, we have. We have. And, and we both think that you should be Luna's maid of honor. And, and then you can get the whole story of our whirlwind romance when you're planning the wedding. Right? Wow. We'll be sisters. Right. How could he not tell me his sister was coming? And what does he have against his parents anyway? I knew he was spoilt. What? She's rich and important, so of course the job would go to her. Ang, are you seriously upset you're not my maid of honor for my fake wedding? When I get married for real you will be my first and only choice. Really? What? She's actually outside. Angelina! Don't let her run away with the planning. I know you, you're a people pleaser and next thing you know you'll be walking down the aisle in his mother's dress. But, also, be convincing. Like it's legit. We need that publicity or it's really gonna be lights out here, Lu. - Here. - Ok. Thanks for making me the real maid of honor. It's cute, this place. Thank you. You must be really special for him to consider dropping anchor. No matter how big the sea may be, sometimes two ships meet. Chinese proverb. Ah. Jackson and I have a lot in common. Oh, like what? The ocean. And we both like helping people. Everybody likes helping people. It's human nature. And family matters to both of us. He said that? Yes, he did. He, he said that. If you don't start taking this act seriously we're gonna tank the interview. I am taking this seriously. Come on, a clam shell? And you might have wanted to mention your sister is joining us or that you don't actually get along that well with your parents. I need you to hold this stuff. And, how did you know about my book? You didn't want me to know about your book? I thought you wanted me to read it. It was in one of the folders. No, I definitely did not want you to read it. I don't know how that got in there. It's not finished. Well I think it's important that I know the facts, right? Well, not those kinds of facts. Oh, ok. What are we doing here? Time to work. Work? Um... Where oh where is the fish stick guy's wardrobe when you need it? Don't worry, it's not that messy. Ok, just gonna spritz? Spritz away. Spritz and swish. All right. This was my dad's. He restored it. Everyone else saw a piece of scrap. He saw a project. Wow. He really was great. He spent 30 years teaching history. The museum and this boat were his hobby on the weekend. Or whenever he got time off. He never got a chance to finish it. So, I dusted off his plans and I've been working on it little by little. He loved old things. Is that why you're so interested in history? Yeah. If people could see how much of what we love now comes from the past, maybe they'd work a little harder to make sure it doesn't get lost. Anyway, it's just a few more repairs and she'll be ready for a test run. What are we waiting on? Let's get to work. The reason we wanted you to come is Dominic and I have been talking and we want to throw you an engagement party this weekend. Doesn't have to be anything big, it's just a little something to celebrate the two of you. No, no, no, that's not at all necessary. And, you know, for Jackson and his family, kind of have to keep it on the down low. Yes, that is a very sweet offer though. We want to do this for you. It would mean a lot. And your mother only has you. You can't expect her to pass up an opportunity to celebrate her daughter. Give a little thought, huh? An engagement party. An actual, real event. Well, on the bright side, I guess it means we make a pretty convincing couple. Look, it's just playing a part. I do this all the time. These are real people. Not chit-chat followers, ok? I understand where you're coming from, but we've made it this far and the interview is only a couple days away. Deceiving a handful of people, which is still definitely not ok, is different than hosting an entire celebration of that deception. People will bring us gifts. Which only helps us pass the test. Right? Imagine all the good this article will do the museum once it comes out. I have to tell her. Then I'm gonna tell my family too. You can't tell them. Cracks will appear. Yeah, but it would be off if your mom and Dominic knew everything and my family knew nothing. The more people we bring in on it the more lies we're asking people to tell. All right. We have to keep this thing small. Then it's only fair to everyone that we don't tell anyone until it's all over. Mm. They just keep coming. How will we choose when they're all so good? Oh, I'm so happy that they're going to cater. It's like old times. About the party. I came here because I thought it would be better... You just can't choose from an emailed menu, right? And isn't this so lovely? It's just... It's just that... You're not allowed to tell me that you don't want a party. I don't want a party. We don't want a party. We're not what you think. You overthink things, chickadee. You always have. It's good to be smart but not so smart that you talk yourself out of the good things in life. It spoils the moment. Don't let it spoil this. Let yourself feel it. Don't question it. Carrot cake. I save all the ones by Nolan Elias. Even though they're the society pages, he's really good. This'll give us a good idea of the kinds of questions he'll ask. Hey, look. I, I know the engagement party's kind of awkward, but I do think it'll give him the last bit of evidence he needs. No going back now. - Wait a minute. - What? - Isn't that your dad? - Yeah, it is. He didn't just work for the preservation society, he largely funded it. I bet we'll find loads more about this in the Island Post. You have a letter. That's from my dad. This place is full of them, it's like a scavenger hunt. The first one was a complete surprise. I found it about three weeks after his funeral. Fell out of one of my favorite books. Then a few weeks later, I was rearranging some artifacts in a display and found another one. That's such a nice thing to do. After a few months I stopped finding them. That was it. So, I keep them exactly where I found them. Just, so it's never over. What do you say about going on a scavenger hunt? Really? Yeah, I mean, don't you think I should know your dad? That's the last one. I know it's greedy, but I can't help but secretly hope that one day I'll be going about my business, not expecting anything at all, and I'll find just one more. Anyway, let's see what we can find on your dad. So, it looks like you are sometimes willing to abandon profit margins. What is it, Dad, you don't trust me? You don't think I'm capable? These were different times, Jack. You can't run a business from your heart anymore. Dad... You know, I remember that lighthouse. I must have been five or six and you, and Mom, and Posey, you wanted to climb to the top. It looked like the stairs went on forever. Sure enough, about 50 steps up, my legs turned to Jell-O. Couldn't make it any further. I started to cry. Eventually you all realized that I was no longer behind you and Mom started yelling and Posey started telling me to muster. And I froze and then I heard steps coming down those metal stairs. I pulled my head out of my hands and I realized that they were yours. You went up and down those stairs twice that day. You even carried me when I didn't think that I could make it any further. I guess I hoped that even if they tore that lighthouse down, you still would be the father that would look after me. I have to admit, at first I didn't believe that Jackson was engaged. Now, not that you're not fabulous, don't get me wrong. But, I was worried that he was messing with you, but I can tell he really likes you, and I can tell you like him, and more importantly, I like you. We're gonna be sisters, so I thought you should meet some of my friends. Imogene Heron! And hello to you too. I have been a fan of yours since college. Oh, come now. Have I been around that long? Sorry it's just, you are my absolute heroine. Dog eared doesn't begin to describe the state of your books on my shelf. Well-loved. Very well-loved. We've acquired Imogene's books for our e-library. Jack said you were a fan and I thought, wait a minute, Luna's a writer too. She's written an amazing book. You've read my book? Well yeah, Jack gave it to me. Not only have I read it, but I'm adding it to our publishing slate. If you're willing. Welcome to the family. Well, maybe after the article comes out and things settle down around here, you'll get some free time to write or date, go out. Have some hobbies. Anyways, I already turned it down. Really? Well, it's still pretty neat that someone wanted to publish it. Maybe you're manifesting. Oh, who's manifesting? Hi. Oh, it's nothing. Posey introduced me to Imogene Heron today. Oh! That's nice. Yeah. She's an excellent writer of local history. Yes. She's my favorite. April 29th, 1989. Taurus. Grew up here in Edson, only child. Went to public school, honor roll, real smarty pants. You were captain of the field hockey team, also all conference. Uh, you went to college upstate where you traded hockey for history. Your ideal night out is actually a night in playing backgammon and palace, like your dad and his buddies used to play. Your fantasy dinner guests would include Elizabeth 1, - Maya Angelou... - Yeah. Charles Dickens, Jacques Cousteau, Eleanor Roosevelt. - Huh? - Gold star. Would have been a double gold star except you're missing Imogene Heron. Ah! Of course. Your favorite historian. Actually, make that a silver. What!? For meddling. Ok, come on, your book is reaching no one if it's just sitting there in a pile. Like I told Posey, I don't have time. Your writing is so engaging though, Luna. It's so... You're as great as Imogene Heron. Maybe even better. I haven't even written the last chapter. You know, I have some ideas about that. What if you used it as an opportunity to talk about the present. About preserving history for future generations, starting with ocean cleanup. I mean, I could introduce you to the gang at Ocean Can. Like I said, stop meddling. Ok. I just... The book can wait. The museum is more important. But she's offering you a publishing deal, Luna. What if the book could help save the museum. What if people came to visit a museum that was curated by the best-selling author, Luna Morelli? Are you pushing for bronze? Come on! Let's just go check out this lookout point that our fathers created. Wow. It's beautiful. I haven't been out here for years. Over there, see where the water looks brown? Yeah. That's the sand bar where Jeremiah Smith would wait. All those ships thinking that a land pirate was a lighthouse. Well, hundreds were saved by the lighthouse that stood right there. How do they find their way now? I don't know. Technology? Hope you're pleased with yourself. You know, I was thinking that you wouldn't have to take so many notes if you were retelling something that actually happened. There's not a lot that we can do about the parts that we've already made up, but... Luna Morelli, will you marry me? You did not? I did, and look. You don't really have an option now, you have to say yes. Ok, then, yes. I'm not. I'm not. I don't know why she won't try on the wedding dress. I mean, you went to all that trouble, Angelina. Mm-hm. And really, her maid of honor should be here too. Because it's an engagement party not my wedding. And no, my maid of honor doesn't need to be here. Especially not when I have Angelina. But what's the harm in trying on the dress that Angelina brought? I mean, you're gonna have to start thinking about that at some point soon. My cousin's did take 12 weeks, better to be prepared. Oh. Well maybe I could just borrow your cousin's again then. Not on my watch. My beautiful daughter is wearing her very own bridal gown. And if it's that beautiful one that Angelina found even better. You're getting ahead of yourself. We're just trying to get through an engagement party. The first event at the museum! I think we picked good ones. The marinated skewers, the little fish and chips in the newspaper. Do you think we need more vegetarian options? People are so health conscious these days. I can't wait to try the grilled pineapple. Come on, Lulu. Just try the dress while we're all here together. Mom. Just for two seconds, then I'll shut up. Ok, look at the silhouette. It looks like I'm closer in landing the support of another board member. Really? Imagine if I can pull this off without Dad's vote. I mean, he just wants to keep doing things the exact same way. He thinks that money is the sole reason for the family business, not what we as a family have done to make the world a better place. Ok, hold on. Is this about the future of our company or is this about you and Dad? Of course it's about the future of the company. - Ok. - It is. All right. Great. Oh. If your father could see you now. What did I say? I owe you an apology. I thought you were taking advantage of a situation but I can see that it's real. Thanks, Dad, that... that means a lot. She's very special. I may even reconsider my vote. Wow. That's great Dad, thank you. Yeah, that's... So, tomorrow... What, you don't feel ready? No, no, no. I think we're great. I think we've done really well in less than a week. Have you ever considered a career as an FBI profiler? I think you'd be really good at that. If he were to ask, what would you say was the moment when you knew? That I couldn't stop at just dating you? Um, let me think about that one. We eliminate the worst choices, remember? Like... ok, ok. It wasn't the time he lectured me on recycling. And it wasn't the time he organized lobster night. Might have been a series of moments when I realized the kind of person he was and the lengths he'd go to do the right thing. Your turn. Uh... I'll get back to you on this one. Say anything. What matters is we're on the same page, right? Yeah. Totally. I will nail it tomorrow. I promise. November 7, 1987. Met through paparazzi. Relax. We got this. Hey, Luna and Jackson. Come on down. What do we have here? This is Sunflowers. It's her favorite spot. You ever been there? Nah. Oh, man. I'm talking the best pizza. I mean, Nolan, I got to tell you there was a lot of spritzing and swishing. Isn't that right? Troublemaker. Agitator. Rabble-rouser. You are officially becoming his other half. People have the wrong idea about him. Yes, he's a fighter. He's one of the good guys. I don't think of him as famous. I think of him as my best friend. So, that's everything? And then some. I'm very really happy for you guys. Thank you. And this will come out this weekend? All being well. My editor has the final say, of course. Of course. Well, feel free to pop by the engagement party. Sure. If I'm in the area. Hey, whatever happened with your writing? I remember the first chapter of a book or something. Non-fiction but felt a lot like fiction. You were really good. The best in our class. I never finished it. Shame. You really had something. I told you so. Nailed it! - We got this. - Did it. You look great. Oh. Thanks. You went all out. Yeah well, you know, special occasion. Let's see. I called your mom for some tips. We have arancini, chicken parm. You called my mom? Yeah, I think she has the entire menu memorized by heart. I bet she does. That was nice, earlier. Yeah, it was. You know, that was the only interview with the press I've ever enjoyed. You were pretty convincing. See? Studying pays off. Yeah, but did we really need all those notes? Well, they got us started. Of course, it was all acting, like you said. Right? Yeah, right. Um... How should we do this? Maybe we shouldn't put too much thought into it. Yeah. Let's keep it simple. Simple's good. It's easier to remember. Not that we could forget, right? True. So, who should initiate? Gosh, I've never put so much thought in this. You know what? I think it should probably be you. Only because if I do the breaking up, everyone's gonna think that I'm a jerk. Yeah. The break up, yeah. It should be all me because the things that are important to me just don't seem important to you. Yeah. So clever. That's why I love you. So, maybe we do it a week after the article comes out? You know, you can say something like seeing it in print was a big reality check, or... Sure. Luna: I can't do this, Angelina. Come on, we are so close. So close to what? To convincing all the people I care about that I'm in love with someone I barely know? You convinced Nolan Elias. He just called. His editor loves the story so much, he wants to print it this Saturday. And then what? You don't want it to end. You love him. No. I thought there was something, maybe... I was wrong. Fake it, but be warned, you'll never quite make it. Luna, no, I'm sorry. This was all my idea. I was trying to imagine a better way to- No. I went with it because I care about this place. And I still do. Jack, what are you doing out here? You're gonna be late for your own party. Have you ever been on the verge of closing a deal that you've been working really hard on and then all of a sudden it just doesn't feel right? Yeah, and you want to pull out but you feel like it's gotten personal? Exactly. It isn't... personal. It's still business Jack, it's always business. I don't know, Posey. I mean, this one feels like it cut straight to my core. Ok, wait, are we, um, are we still talking about those Ocean Can guys? I can't lie to you anymore. Luna and I aren't engaged. I just met her down on the docks and she accidentally put me in her newsletter and then when Dad said that he wasn't gonna vote for me I grabbed at the opportunity to prove him wrong, except now he thinks that we're an actual couple. Jackson Valentine, you didn't. Toying with our hearts so you'd look like some family man? So we'd vote you onto the board? The vote you should have been worrying about was mine. I'm glad I decided not to back you. I need to think about the future, Jack. I need the company to be stable. I need to think about what's best for my family and for me. The family that I haven't really been a part of for a long time. I'm really sorry, Posey. I think you're right about me. I usually am. I'm more interested in being right than doing right. I just know you and Dad, and if you both wanted to, you... you know. Yeah, I do know, but it's complicated and... There's more to life than being on the board, right? And if I want to pursue the board seat then I can find an honest way. Hey, for what it's worth? You may have just swayed my vote. Life begins, right? Thanks. Sounds great. Except there's only one problem. You're in love with her. No, thank you. Mom... Have you tried the rollatini? It is to die for! I love it when they take the skin off the eggplant. Oh, don't you? Honey, you're not gonna eat? This is your big night, you need your energy. I'll eat later. Mom, I need your help. Help with what? You look perfect. I told you, this was the dress. You and I both know I'm not supposed to be here. Honey, you deserve to be here as much as anyone. Mom. Oh, hi! Hi. Hi. I actually can't talk to you. Luna, please. I just wanted to say I... Hey, can I talk to you about something? I... I need to tell you something. So do I. I can't do this. They believe us. Not only do they believe us but they believe in us. They all want very, very badly for us to be happy. They're going to be so disappointed. What if it's true, like real. What are you talking about? That's crazy. Is it, though? Is it really that crazy? I mean, we, we have been spending all this time together and you're a very special person to me. You can't start a relationship based on a lie. That's wrong, that's not real. It feels pretty real to me. It does. And, and we can go back in there and we can have them celebrate us and all that we are and they would be none the wiser. Oh. Isn't that convenient. Celebrate this supposed us, rather than waste this great party, huh? Luna. Luna, I think you're misunderstanding. As your mother would say, takes one to know one, right? Someone in love. The two of you and me and your mother. You know, Dominic, I think she's just speechless because it's all so special. No. I'm sorry. No. It's not what you think. Really. It's not what you think. We're not engaged. We never were. I've wanted to tell you. My dad trusted me with this place. I just wanted to make him proud. I don't think he'd be proud of me right now. This is not how you save a sinking ship. Mom. Jack. Jackson. Come on! You didn't tell her how you feel? Of course I told her. She didn't' want to hear it, Posey. Well, it is pretty unforgivable, you know. Faking a relationship with someone just so they'll vote you onto the board. Maybe she just needs some time. Luna. So, it was a business deal? No. No, what I told you back there was true. I mean, yes, it started off as a way to get me on the board but then I got to know you and... And no matter how you felt, you still didn't bother to tell me the whole truth. It was more convenient to formalize our engagement tonight just in time for the board to vote, instead of having a real party when the time was right. You wanted to keep up the charade. I wasn't the only one faking it for my own personal gain. I wasn't doing it for myself, I was doing it for my father. For your father? That's pretty convenient. You say that you want to be loyal to history, but the truth is you're stuck in the past. You've been acting like you support me, like you care about this place. This whole time you've just been luring me into your selfish plan to ensure your own prosperity. You know who you are? Jeremiah Smith. Jeremiah, Jeremiah Smith? Come on. I... It was never, ever my intention to hurt you or your business, I promise. No, that's right. Because without seeing how lucky you are to have one, you save all the hurtful stuff for your father. Voicemail: You have one voice message. Luna Morelli, this is your final notice before we take court action against you. Hi. There's someone here to see you. I don't think my heart could take... Not him. Come here. It's ok. You know, one of these days I'd love it if you told me more about him. I'm not trying to replace him, but knowing who he was will help me know who you are. History, right? Now, you know your mother. She's expecting me. So, of course she's gonna be a little upset for about a minute. Don't take no for an answer. Ok. Mom. I don't know whether to get the minestrone or the Italian wedding soup. I don't want to be too full because I'm going to get the gyro... Mom, stop talking about food. I can't stop. That's what we talk about. Why can't we just be a regular mother and daughter and talk about normal things? Why is it always food, food, food? Because that's all that's left to talk about. Everything else is a no fly zone. You don't want to talk about your father, you don't want to talk about me and Dom, you don't want to talk. But you have to eat, right? Oh, my goodness. I never thought of it like that. When there's nothing left, there's food. I'm not forgetting him, but I had to move on. And I froze you out for it. And maybe I thought with you getting married, we could end the deep freeze. Mom, it was just supposed to be for one week. You weren't even supposed to know about it until after when... I could explain it all to you. You tried to explain it, but I didn't want to believe you. I pushed you because I wanted us to be like we used to be. So, I could finally say yes. He's been asking me for a year. He thought the jig was up when he ran into you outside the jewelry store. But I can't accept if you're not on board. Oh, Mom. Of course I'm on board. That's wonderful. I'm so sorry, Mom. I'm sorry for making it so hard for you to move on. I'm sorry for pretending the museum was fine. For pretending to be engaged. I'm so sorry for pretending to be in love. I'll accept your apology, for all but one. I know you, and I know you weren't pretending. He's all wrong. He's privileged, he's selfish. Argumentative. Never in a million years would I bring Jackson Valentine home to meet Dad. Are you sure about that? I want to show you something. But there weren't any more. How did you know that was there? I told you, I'm good at keeping secrets. I was supposed to save it for when you walked down the aisle. "So this is it. Your big day. "If you're reading this, "it means I'm not there to personally walk you down the aisle "I would give anything to see you right now. "You look beautiful. "Now, I love your necklace," "but I hope you swapped your ship pendant just for today." "I hope that when you get to the end of that aisle, "you're looking at someone who brings out the best in you. "Someone who makes you laugh, "who helps you carry in all those rusty old artifacts. "Like father, like daughter, right? "Someone who knows what a wonder you are and supports your dream, "because the only thing I ask, "is that today, and every day, "you are happy. "Follow your heart. "Do the things that make you feel excited about being here "on this incredible planet. "And I promise you, it'll always lead you to treasure." "With love, Dad." Dad. Come here. I love you. I love you. This just arrived for you. Thanks. All my dad wanted was for me to be happy. I feel awful because I haven't been. Not for a long time. Ever since I stopped writing, when the museum started taking up more and more of my time. There's something else I haven't been seeing. You've always been the real maid of honor. Not just for me. But for the Maritime Museum. You have never once faked anything about your passion for my father's museum. For your museum. If I'm gonna finish that last chapter and get it back to my publisher, I'm going to need a lot more time to write. Luna... I hope you'll come to my book event. Well, actually you're kind of running it. If you're up to it. Yes! Yes! Yes! We're manifesting. I don't think I've ever seen you like this. Why don't you just call her? I can't. It's totally backfired. Everyone hates me. That... that journalist won't even write about me anymore. I thought you said you wanted to do right, not be right. Hey, Dad. So look, um, until I met Luna I never understood the importance of legacy. Like our family business. I've decided to give up on the board seat. Yeah, I have some other ideas that I want to pursue and I might make the side company more of a front and center kind of thing. I appreciate that. The thing is, I might have backed you in the end. I've been watching you, and I realized if I could feel even half as passionately as you do about the things you believe in then well, maybe the bottom line isn't so important. Things are going well enough that maybe it's time to think like the old days. Like with the lighthouse. Here's the thing, though. You've always put your ideas above all else, and at times it has cost you. I know. The question is, can you let those go a little? Start thinking like a businessman? You're finally willing to give the start-ups a chance? Dad, with our technology, they will succeed. I'm talking the Ocean Can, and Sea Legacy, Coral Caring. The research and projections that I have are amazing. They really are. I was talking about the girl. Oh. Posey. You know, I was only pushing you because I believe in you. But I'm also sort of known for my pushiness. Even with a push, I guess I wasn't ready to hear it. Well, lucky for me, now you are. I'm sorry about you and Jack, but if it's all right by you, I was wondering if you'd still like to be sisters. Hi. Welcome, everyone. Before we begin our reading of "Through the Water", we have an introduction from the author writing the book's forward, Ms. Imogene Heron. It's no mean feat that a work of non-fiction has taken me through the gamut of emotions. All while informing me of our precious local history. I sincerely congratulate Luna on this special book and I look forward to seeing it in print soon. Now, without further ado, I give you author and historian, Luna Morelli. I've always said history is important because it makes you aware of all the precious things you need to hold onto. But now I know, if you cling too tightly to the past, you risk missing what's right in front of you, in the here and now. I've kept this book buried in a drawer for years because I was afraid, taking time away from this museum. And I didn't know how it would end. A really good friend tried to tell me this and I wouldn't listen. History isn't just in my hands, it's in all our hands. I know it now. Change will come. And our treasures won't be lost. Here, here. From now on, these treasures will be in the hands of Ms. Angelina Robinson. Angelina has been... Is that a light? Angelina has been the backbone... Excuse me. Time and tide wait for no man. So, when did you know? It was when you cried over the microfiche. It was when you asked me to marry you, holding a clam shell. It's when you wrote the best history book that I've ever read. It was when you asked to get to know my dad.
