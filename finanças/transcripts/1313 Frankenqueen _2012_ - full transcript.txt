Holy Malibu swank, this place is nice... We'll see! Oh, I'm Andy, by the way. Forgot to introduce myself in the limo... was too excited by all the buttons. So I noticed. I'm Matt. How crazy is this, huh? Getting paid to be test subjects by some celebrity doctor. She's the Kardashian of plastic surgeons; she's all about how the pieces fit, she has no idea what its like being human. Don't kid yourself, we're going to be guinea pigs for her vanity. That wasn't in her invitation. Whats up, gents. You must be Matt and Andy! I'm Dan. Where's our hostess? Who... oh, you mean Victoria. She's doing... something. Haven't seen that much of her so far, so we've been chilling out by the pool and the hot tub. A pool? And a hot tub? Yep. Go take a dip. Has she began work yet? Oh, you mean whatever tests she's suppose to do? Not really. Just a lot of questions and stuff. although she did pay the first half in cash, so that was pretty cool. Ha's she talk about her work? Does she have testing facilities here? Dude , Look at this place. I don't think I've seen half the rooms here yet. She said to make ourselves at home, so go get 'em, tiger. Nice meeting you... tool. Dan You the new guy? Ya, I guess. I'm Andy. Oh,, Good for you. I'm going to work out. So... what's been going on here? You really want to know? Sure. Welp,, Spencer and I - Spencer is the bag of meat who just left by the way -- we have a bet to see who can bang the cougar first. Victoria is a cougar? Oh, yeah. Not my thing mind you, but a hundred bucks is a hundred bucks. That's true. My money's on you. Good call. Whats going on about these experiments she bin talking about doing? We're getting paid a nice chunk of change to answer her questions and swim in her pool and eat her food. I dont think she's planning to stick us with needles if that's what you're worried about. No... well, Yaa... The only one who's getting stuck with anything is her. You with me... get what I'm saying? I think so... Ok .. Hey, be a good guy and get me a beer from the kitchen. Oh. Ok.. sure... It's me, I'm in her house.. I told you not to doubt me. no, I haven't seen any kind of lab or equipment, don't worry, you'll get your hands on a dry fusion laser and anything else I can find... Don't worry, I'll play nice ish. Look, you'll get your on every thing and more.. I guarantee it. Hey, Spence... Spencer. It's been bugging me all day. don't I know you from somewhere? Played linebacker in the pros for two seasons. All-American at Cal State. That's right... number 55. Yep What're you doing here? What.. You don't have the internet? Nah. I got suspended from the league. No way man, That sucks. What'd you do? Performance enhancing drugs. Oh... did they? Did they what? Enhance? You know... You're a moron. It's science, man, I was just asking. I can get use to this. Ya, Me too. Especially if you get us another round of beers. I'm fine. Your loss. Hey, thanks for bringing that one; he's handy. I didn't bring him. Do you know when we meet the lady in charge? She said something about having a sit down this afternoon, once everybody got here. Why? You want a piece of our cougar hunt? What? Spence and I, hundred bucks on who nails her first. What? Trust me, there's something about her... Something say's she would do some freaky stuff Every part of your body. I'm just got first dibs. Do you know who her husband was? Dr. Jeffery Franks. He invented the dry fusion laser she uses in her plastic surgery practice. He also invented a dozen other instruments and explored an entirely new field of reconstructive neuroscience. Yippee, he's all yours. He's dead. He's still all yours. You don't get it do you? She's coopted all his research all of his findings and she won't share it with anyone else. She pretends to be this fantastic sergeant but but in reality she's a fraud and a wanna be... Oh cool, you brought the beer. Bring it on over. Nice... Well, Hello, gentleman. Glad to see you're all here. I have recruited you here to help me with some very important medical research I'm conducting. My medical research has to do with the field of plastic surgery. And as such, I will be asking you to do a variety of physical activities while I watch and take notes. That's it? We're not going to get physical? There will be some examinations, but i will deal with each of you retain your privacy. I assure you it will be nothing painful. And it's just for the weekend? Yes. and i will owe you the balance on monday. So do not worry your pretty little heads. You know, it's something of an honor to meet you. Only 'something' of an honor? Your husband, Jeffery Franks.. Was.. My late husband Your late husband was something of a scientific hero to me. I helped him in all his research. And I am a surgeon of some renown. Of course. A plastic surgeon. From Beverly Hills. Where else would the best and most innovative practice be? Where the money is, dear boy. Dude, chill out. Sorry. Didn't mean for it to sound negative. Oh yes you did. But impudence is to be expected from youth. As is being poor, ignorant and lacking social grace. But I am glad you excepted my invitation. I've spoken to your professors. They seem to think you hold a great deal of promise. I suppose we have to see this weekend. I suppose we will. Anyway, please make your self at home. I only ask that you do not step in the back building.. That is where my lab is and that is where i conduct my work.. Ahh.. What about your bedroom? Oh, , you are the naughty boy, Rich.. You know what's on my mind. I will. Come on boy's I really need you to try your best. Really dig deep. Dan, you're very strong. I assumed Spencer would do the best at the strength portion of the tests. Oh, very nice recovery, Spencer. I appreciate your dedication to the physical. Very Nice.. And how are you doing? Very Nice.. Nice work, Rich. Though your mind seems to be other places. Oh, Andy, Andy I had really hoped you show more positive attributes.. Well done Matt. I never expected you were to be quite that flexible. Ok Boy's common let's stretch, I really like to see you stretch deeply . . Hmm.. This is your last test... this morning. I have a whole battery of other tests for you this afternoon. I can't believe it... split times are all over the place. And with what you told me earlier... Wait who told you what? Nothing, I'm sure it was just venting. No worry's. It's not a contest, boys. So, which one of us is doing better? She just said it wasn'nt a contest. Shut up, egghead.. Nobody was talking to you! Fine. Be stupid. What'd you say to me? So you mean to tell me these assholes are beating me at this? I never implied... Dude, you need to chill. That's right Andy, you tell him. What, I didn't say anything... Shut you piehole, nerd. Lay off him. Aggressive tendencies instigated.. Be careful, boys... no one likes bruised merchandise... I'm so disappointed in all of you. And I might add I considered releasing you from my research with out further money. But, boys will be boys I always thought my late husband could use a little vinegar... but we'll fix that... In the mean time, I've set up a triage center in the kitchen. You may show up one at a time. I thought you had your own lab in the mansion. I do. But as I made clear, it's for the research not patching up a bunch of overeager chuckleheads. You can come in first. Hey! You ruin this for us, I'm going to hurt you. Go ahead, jerkwad. I hope she probes you to find out why you're such a pain in the ass. Is that a dry fusion laser? Yes,Would you like to see how it works? Yes. Please. Ah, You've got a wound on the back of your head. Yep.. It's going to need stitches. Nope. It's not. I know you have very little respect for me, Matt. But I hope to earn your respect by the end of the weekend.. Done? Done? What's this? You won't have a scar, should you ever choose to shave your head. Let's see! You have no other cranial injuries. In fact, your brain is very impressive. I look forward to a meeting of the minds later ...thanks... So, are you still gonna pay us... because I could really use this money. Ahh ha.. Oh.. Despite your recreational drugs use , your brain is realy healthy. It seem's like your spatially inclined. Um, if that means I'm handy, then yeah. And that's cool about my brain. Ahh ... Cool... So you are going to continue with my research... Im just going to avoid any of your critical thinking centers. Cool. Thanks. Mhmm. Your aggressive, sociopathic tendencies are nearly off the chart. Mhmm. Thanks. Ahhaa... Wow, Properly harnessed, these could be really beneficial. You know it. So uh how's my shoulder, doc? Oh, It'll be fine. So, I was thinking... Hhmm.. Ohh. Nope, you weren't. Says right here on the scanner. Hhmm.. You have so many unused portions of your brain. That could prove very useful. You Know .. My leg hurts a little... Umm, Ya.. I'm going need to take a samples of your brain tissue later, if you don't mind. OK. Oh, as far as your leg goes, I fixed the wound. But i would stay away from fighting Rich in the future. He's a biter. Sounds good to me!! Ohhh,... What is it? Your steroid use started in high school? What's it to you? how many concussions do you think you have had while playing football? I don't know... 10 You know, I hoped your unparalleled work ethic and physical coordination would would be the cornerstone of my research... But your brain is swiss cheese. What do you mean? Tapioca. I'm surprised you can breathe and walk at the same time... OK, You don't know what you're talking about. Eleven! What? You have had at least Eleven! concussions. Your body is your temple... but you have treated the penthouse like a men's room truck stop! How can you guys just sit in here after everything that happened earlier? Poppa's gotta soak. Dude, it happens. Don't stress out. Victoria fixed us right up. And you didn't find that a little weird... What? I don't know... I've never seen anything like the gadgets she used before. Ka.. Have you ever seen the Earth? What? You know, the whole Earth, like from space? No.. But it exists, Right. Ya.. See.. So there. Stuff exists you didn't know exists, because that's the way the world works, man. She wants to get a sample of my brain tissue. I think you should totally let her. It's good manners. Ohh and uhh, Sorry I bit you by the way. I thought you were somebody else. I had everything in hand, all the firing synapses at my disposal; all with complimentary attributes... But this one... Don't worry, this moves the timeline forward, just a little but we will have all the tools we need. Hey, Victoria, care to join us? The water's great... and a so am I. I do like an aggressive man, but it's easy to come by... psychologically speaking. I don't get it. Ohh, I know. Suffice to say your particular attributes are like fast food, abundant and interchangeable. I got it in spades, darling. I know. That's what I said. Dan, Would you come with me? You don't need a drug test right now, do you? Cause I'd fail... No. I just need to pick your brain a little. OK. Hey.!! What about me? Oh You'll get your turn, Rich. Trust me. Ya Victoria, You'll be getting all the, Richman.. ...yes, I know... I know that, I'm keeping it together... yes, she used the dry fusion laser and she had some other non-invasive diagnostic instrument with her too... yeah, I thought you'd like that. Look you will get every thing you asked for.. But the price is double. ...Whatever, look you want the tech, you got to pay. I gotta go. I'll let you know when I'm out. Matt. I'll be with you shortly. I would like to ease your mind about a couple of things. Hey dude!! Come on... make this easy on me... Oh, hey.. Hey!! I need you to come with me. Sure... And if you do everything I tell you. You won't feel a thing. Um... It's for science. Ohh, Ok i guess.. Yaaa. Yes. It's going to be a variation on the diagnostic laser only this one is going to bisect your brain into millions of reusable, retrainable synapse pairs. Is this like on 'Star Trek,' when they fix Spock's brain? Noo, You are going to be a lot of useless data, Arn't you? I will, I promise. Thanks. Wow, It's so dark in here... Don't you worry about that... Where's all the other's? Uhhh,, Don't know. As long as no one's banging Victoria. Doctor Cougar is mine. Don't you see there's something else going on here? Something she's not telling us? Dude, she's old and lonely and lives in a house the size of a city block. I'm sure the others found the game room or nerdling found the office with all the books in it. What office? Downstairs hallway, Turn left instead of right. The door has a lock, but someone broke it hoping to steal some pharmaceuticals... or at least that's what I think the motive would be if it were me. Just watch your back... You need to try some of Dan's weed... That's what you need to do. Alright, Victoria, time to get physical with the Rich-man. This is it... Dr. Jeffrey Franks office... Jeffrey Franks journal... This is it... I'm ready for my physical, Doctor. Actually, I was a little flattered by that contest you and Spencer put together.. He told you about that? No, Dan did actually... in a manner of speaking. Oh, that guy, his mind is a terrible thing to waste... You know i didnt find His mind wasn't wasted at all. I must admit.. So... did Spencer win the bet? Ohh.. I wouldn't let Spencer touch me in any way, shape or form. Ahh, What about me? Rich. You're going to be easy to take apart. Now we're talking Why dont you close your eyes... This isn't going to hurt, is it Doctor? Actually, it probably will. This can't be real. Oh, it's very real. Jeffrey didn't think his theories should be put into practice. He said the cost was too great. You made... a monster...? I created life where there was none. In an image of my choosing. That's not possible... Neither is cold fusion laser, Neither is any one of the other half-dozen devices I've invented to ensure my creation thrives. I don't believe it. You believed it so much that you came here to try to steal my technology. Who sent you? Massive Dynamic? Miskatonic Tech? How much did they pay you? I assure you. It was not enough!! I... I don't... Ohh.. Speechless. Finally... Rise, Rocky! Rise !! Rise !! What... is this? It's my creation. You created this... thing? Oh you must admit. He is attractive by any standard. He will be my equal in every way. My child My companion. But, it's brain? You read Jeffrey's journal. You know what he was referring to. Neural infusion techniques, temporal mapping, cranial reassignment... He will have his own personality, His own thoughts, his own... Soul. That's impossible. Certainly, right now. I need another dose of infusion of preexisting brain matter to complete the process. Whose brain... Rocky... ...Mother... You will be my perfect man. My perfect companion. What?... I told you, I've had more important things to do. Well, if the board wants to fire me, so be it. I quit. Idiots... They'll be sorry... Rocky! Rocky, honey, are you OK? I'm fine. We're fine... Come back to bed, honey. I have a few more things to teach you. What is it? Did you have more dreams? That will happen. Or more memories; that will take time to process... But we'll build your history soon enough. I know who I am. I am your creation. Made out of parts from men you found through your plastic surgery practice. And my brain is made up from the attributes of the men you hired to provide me with life. Your self-awareness is such a big step, Rocky. Soon, we'll be able to work together, research together... and your skills will be unmatched, because I gave yo so many... She did this to us. I don't like it. She murdered us all. You made me perfect. To continue your husbands research... Our research... Ya, we will be perfect together... She's not going to get away with this, is she? Let's throw her off the roof and be done with it... Perhaps if made her as perfect as her creation... Made some improvements, peel away the years, so to speak. We may make some mistakes along the way... we wouldn't want her to be ugly, would we? What are you thinking, my love?
