It's, put a little muscle to it, maybe paint it, you know? Yeah. Change the floors a bit. I could do something with that. Absolutely. Yeah... Well, wonderful, wonderful. Um, why don't we go back to my office and we can get the paperwork filled out. Yeah. It's christmas eve, I know you'd like to be in. How about that, huh? Yeah, I would love that. You saw that, man?

But, uh, I'll get you the two bucks in about two days, all right? O.k., that's fine. You didn't fill out the employment section. Right, because, uh, I'm in between jobs right now. I'm, I'm a boxer. One of the requirements in qualifying for an apartment here is that you have some form of income. Yeah, no, I do, but I do. I do, I just work off the books, that's all. So it's, like construction and, you know, work hasn't been steady lately, so... Unfortunately, I can't put down that you work off the books. Right, right. I'm gonna have a few jobs lined up right after christmas. That won't work. Management is very strict and since you don't have a guaranteed form of income, I can't process your application. I will have to put you back on the list. What... What are you talking about? I can't give you the apartment unless you are presently employed, onthe books. Your name will go back on the list, and when another apartment becomes available, I'll contact you. My family, my family's in a shelter. And I can't do that anymore. We just can't do that anymore. Do you understand me? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sir. I don't know what else to tell you. You can tell me that the apartment is ours, and we can move in there today. I can't do that. C'mon, it's christmas. It's christmas, give me a break. Can you cut me a break, please? I mean, I'll promise you, I'll have a job by the first of the year. I can guarantee it. I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do. I have a family too, and if I put you down for the apartment and get caught, I can lose my job. Justin, wait for me outside. Give her hell. Yeah. Let me explain something to you, let me explain my situation to you, maybe. Maybe you'll understand. Me and my family, we been having some hard months and all we want is to have an apartment for christmas, that's all. That's all we want, and look, I understand your position. I know what you're in, but imagine having children and sleeping in a dirty shelter on a cold floor for three months, can you imagine that? I understand, I understand... no, but are you imagining that for me? Yes, I understand your position. Many of the tenants who live here were in your shoes at one time or another, but like I said, there's nothing I can do. Right. Nothing you can do. You know, let me ask you something. How many of those tenants that were in my shoes went into the gulf war and fought for this country? How many of them, huh? Excuse me? How many of them went and fought? I went and joined up and fought for this country when I was 18 years old, o.K.? And you're telling me that it's o.K. For me to risk my life, risk my life for you and your family, but you don't have to put anything on the line for me and my family. That's what you're telling me, right? It's not like that. Oh, yeah... yeah. It islike that. It's justlike that. Wait, wait, uh... Come back, please. Do you get a check from the government each month? I don't get anything. I don't get a dime, I don't get nothin'. Look, I leave the office at 6:00 tonight. If you can find a job by then, the apartment's yours. That's the best I can do. Otherwise, and I'm sorry... But I'll have to call the next person on the list. Thank you... And what you're doing. O.k. Thank you so much. So what happened in there? So we didn't get it? No, we didn't get it, einstein, not yet, anyway. Where we going now? To get a job. Why? Why? Because you need a job to get an apartment, that's why. Why didn't you tell her you already have a job, make something up? And what happens when she finds out that I lied, huh? We'll already have the keys. Right, and we get thrown out of another apartment... that'd be just great. No, no... why can't you just... no, you could... actually, you could just tell her... hey guy, let's just... you're not making any sense, right? Could you just shut up for a little while, please? Don't tell me to shut up. You shut up. I'm just trying to help. Hey, you know how you can help? How? By shuttin' up. Stand clear of the closing doors. Oh, man. I'm hungry. Yeah, well, you shoulda ate at the shelter. Can we get something to eat when we get off the train? No, no, no, all the money I got is for the apartment. Shoulda went with mom. Yeah, you shoulda. Who lives here? Just mind your business and don't embarrass me, all right? How you doin'? What are you doin' here? I told you I got no work today. I know, I know, and I'm sorry to bother you and all that, but I need to talk to your father for just one minute. About what? It's about... hello, mr. Montecello, how are you? Hello, how you doin'? Look, I'm sorry to bother you, I know it's christmas eve and whatnot, but I got something very important that I need to talk to you about, if you got a minute, please. We're a little busy right now. Yeah, I realize this, but this is really important. Come on, it's cold. Let him in, come on. Thank you, thank you. You're just gonna leave me out here? Go over there and play with the kids. Play ball, make friends. Why can't i... it's freezing though, I'm cold. So what's this about that you gotta come bother us today? Yeah, well, this isn't easy to say, but me and my family, we're living in a shelter. What are you, homeless? Just about. You hungry or something? Dad, give him a few meatballs and... That's o.K., I didn't come here for food. I didn't come here for handouts. Come on, have a bite. Have a bite. I'm fine, sir, thank you very much, but I'm fine, I'm o.K. Come on, my wife made 200 of them, have a bite. You know, it's an insult to turn down an italian woman's cooking. Come on. Well, I don't want to be insulting anybody, right? Come on, it's good. Be good for you, have a bite. The best. That's great stuff. You want more? No, no, no, I'm great, it hit the spot, thank you very much. Look, I know you guys are very busy and I don't want to take up your time, but the reason I'm here is... I'm a boxer. And I was up for this big fight and I got taken off the card... I knew I recognized you. Yeah, you're the guy that got his ass kicked by caesar rodriguez back at the garden, like two months ago, right? I lost the fight, yeah. You threw in the towel. I saw it on espn. You would have had a shot if you didn't quit. Hit him with a couple good punches, I mean, you still would have got your head beat in, but you would have had a shot, at least. As I was sayin'... um... How can we help you? Well, that's why I'm here, sir, in order for me to qualify for this apartment, we need somebody to tell the people who are running the building that, um, that I work for you guys on the books. But you don't work for us on the books. Well, I know, I know... You want us to lie? No, I'm not asking you to lie. I'm not asking you that, I'm just... need proof of employment, so I can get me and my family out of the shelter and all I need is a w-2 form or a paystub, anything like that. We can't do that... no way. My family will be very appreciative. I'll work it off, I'll work weekends, I'll come here whenever you guys need it, whatever holidays, I don't care. No can do. Come on, vinny, it's christmas time. The guy's down on his luck. Let's give him a break. Maybe we could do something with this. Dad, we can't do it. We're not hiring anyone on the books and we for shit sure ain't lying to the government. Forget it. We'll lose our license, then what happens to us when we lose our license, huh? For this? Look, I'm sorry, my son runs the business. If there was something that we could do, believe me, frank, we'd do it. Thank you, sir, thank you. Merry christmas. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your time. Thanks for leaving me Out in the cold. You're welcome. I wasn't really thanking you. Now where are we going now? In the city. Can we get something to eat? Yeah, we will, in a little while, o.K.? What's that red stuff on your mouth? What red stuff? What are you talking about? The red stuff on the side of your mouth. Did you eat something while you were in there? Come on, man, I bet you didn't know that it's an insult to turn down italian cooking, did you know that? You suck, you know that? You really suck.

Yeah, is that a problem? No, that's great. $12.50's great. Well, mr. Diaz. Hey, hey, why don't you call me frank? Just call me frank. It's what everybody calls me. Frank? Yeah. Well, frank, unless you changed your mind before you walked in that door, you got yourself a job. I do? Merry christmas! Don't be so happy. It sucks, working here. The doctor will be right in. O.k. One, two... good girl. Relax, you're gonna get better. Hi, I'm dr. Desai. Hi. Hi. So what's wrong with this little cutie? Oh, she's been sick for three days, and this morning she woke up with a fever. Oh, flu's going around. Sounds like you're coming down with it, too. Everybody in our shelter is sick. Which shelter is it? Most precious host. It'll be a little cold, o.K.? You know, there are better shelters in the city. There's safe haven downtown. That's for women who've been abused. What are you trying to say? I just see a lot of women come here in need of help and they don't like to talk about it. Well, I don't need help. My husband's never laid a hand on me. We came all the way down here to take care of my daughter. Can we just do that? O.k., um... Can you stick out your tongue for me, please? Wide... ah, say "ah"... Ahh... Oh... o.K., thanks. Listen, I've been down that road in the past and I was smart enough to get out. I know that there are better shelters out there, but that would mean leaving my husband. O.k., I was just giving you options in case you need them, but sounds like you don't. > He's actually out there getting the keys to our new apartment. Our last day at the shelter. Congratulations. All right, well, she's got a lot of inflammation in her throat, so I'm gonna put her on an antibiotic. I'll just get the medicine and I'll get you something for your cough too, o.K.? Thank you. $12.50 an hour, man. You know what that means? You can finally get me something to eat? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna get you something to eat on the way home, but it means yankee stadium, baby, you and me, opening day! Sound like a plan, huh? Yeah. I'm gonna get those seats right on the second tier over first base where all the foul balls go... oh. Can we get hot dogs? Oh, yeah, we're gonna get hot dogs. Hot dogs, peanuts, cotton candy... oh, no peanuts, man. I forgot, you're allergic. We have to have ice cream. Oh, yeah, ice cream. A lot of ice cream. Oh, yeah, tons of ice cream, son, tons of ice cream. Cotton candy, zeppoles... i'm gonna give you so much candy, it's gonna rot your teeth. But, hey, don't think about food right now, man, don't think about food 'cause it'll make you hungry, all right? We got two hours left, a'ight? Oh, we did it. Can you believe that we did it? We did it, little man. Come on, give me five. Give me five... uptown! Midtown! Downtown... oh, man, why'd you slap the brush for? Come on, that's not funny. You see me laughing? I'm not laughing. O.k. We'll go crosstown. That ain't right, man. That ain't right. You think that's right? I got your hand, you got my threads, man, that's a whole other different story. Frank, got a minute? Yeah, yeah, whassup? I mean, I was just about to start painting the wall right now. Look, I need to talk to you. Yeah, yeah, sure, yeah, sure. Keep stirring it, get, get to work, man. Help us out, all right? What's going on? I ran your social through the district computer. Felony charges came under your profile. Do you know anything about that? Felony charge? Said you spent two years in jail. Yeah, well, I... Somethin' did go down. It did go down, I mean, I was a young kid, man, a stupid kid, 21 years old, you know how that is, right? I mean, I was hanging out with the wrong crew and then one night I'm with them and they go into this bodega, but I stayed outside and they took some shit. I didn't even know they were gonna do it. So they held up the place? Well, I don't know. I don't know, like I said, I stayed outside, so I have no clue. But it was a big mess, you know, it was a big mess and I was guilty by association and even the store clerk said that I wasn't a part of it, o.K.? But I couldn't afford a good lawyer, you know how that goes, man. Frank, this is a problem. Mr. Morris, I'm not that guy. O.k., I'm not that guy. That was a long time ago, that was a mistake, you know, I got a wife and two kids, man, that was a wrong time, wrong place, wrong friends, you know what I'm saying? Frank. It happens to everybody, you know, I mean... Frank... Look, I need these classrooms painted as much as you need this job, but the board of education has a policy: No felons near the kids. Now, I'm sorry, but there is no way around that. Right. Justin, come here. Hey, buddy, can I talk to you a second? I'm looking for a guy. Frank diaz, a latino guy, he's a boxer? He's about maybe your size. I used to pick him up here for work, I think I picked him up with you one time. Sorry, I don't know him, man. Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's a good thing, it's a good thing... i'm trying to do the guy a favor. I can't find him, I'm looking all over the place. Can you help me out? Sorry, guy, I can't help you. Oh, man. Aww... Come on, stay over here till it clears up a little bit. You never told me you went to jail. Yeah, you never told me you sucked face with peg leg patty. The things you find out along the way, huh? What the hell you doin' listening to my business anyhow? I couldn't, I could just hear you. Yeah, sure. Does mom know? Yeah, your mom knows. Did you shoot anybody? No, I didn't shoot anybody. See, that's why your mother wants you to take up a sport, man, so you'll stop hanging out on the street or you'll end up in trouble like I did. You know, as a matter of fact, you're signing up for basketball next week. My ankle could be broken. It's gonna be better by then. Now, come on, we haven't got much time, let's go. It's pouring! Put your hood up. Here, find... find me a job, right here. You're not gonna find anything today. It's christmas eve. You want a warm apartment? You want something to eat? Find me something. You buy the paper or you put it down. Abdul, relax, it's just a quarter, all right? I'm running a business here. You look, you buy. Oh, is that so? Yes, that's so. Oh, I found something. What you find? "Stockroom employees needed for holiday." Where at? Right here. Oh, it's hou... houston street. Here... i'm putting it down. You happy? There you go. You happy? Let's go, come on. Wait, whoa, whoa, you can't go like that. Why not? Because you're wet, you have paint on you... Yeah, so what am I supposed to do? Get new clothes, that's what you're supposed to do. Oh, right, right, right. You want to go to armani's maybe, on a little shopping spree? Barney's maybe? You don't have to spend money. No? No. Oh, oh, because people are giving away clothes for free nowadays. Just do what mom does. Yeah? What does she do? I'll tell you when we get there. You sure your mother does this? Yeah. And she gets on me for cursing. Hey, help me pick out a shirt for these pants. How about this one? What, you mean like a pimp? Come on, man. This is more like it. This is good. All right, just stay here. I'll be right back, all right? Get your hands off! Hey... Take it off! Hey, relax. Hey, what's going on? This your kid? Yes, he's my stepson. Why? Just caught him shoplifting. Shoplifting? What are you talking about, man? Hey, you, empty your pockets. Kid, empty your pockets or we're gonna do it for you. Hey, hey, kemosabe, just relax, all right? Just relax. This is a kid, man, please. Empty your pockets, man. What the hell are you doing, man? What the hell are you doing? I'm sorry, man. I don't know what the hell got into him. Listen, we're gonna have to take him in the back. We've gotta write this up. O.k., come on, man, we all make stupid mistakes, right? Come on, look, you got it back, right? So there's no, no harm, no foul... it's all good, right? We're gonna have to take him in the back and write him up. Come on, man, he's... Look, look at him... he's a nine-year-old kid, man. We all make mistakes, right? It's christmas, come on, man. Want me to pay for it? I'll pay for it, man. Sir, it is store policy, all right? I, I know, I know it's store policy, man, but it's not your store, right? I mean, so come on, I'll pay for it. I'll give you the money. Sir, what do you have on underneath that sweater? Oh, oh, man, you know, you know what happened? Man, I forgot to take it off... Uh, we're gonna need some more assistance down here in the men's section. Man, I, I was in the dressing room, man, when I heard the screaming. I didn't get a chance to... Go, go, go, go. Meet you at the newsstand. Go, go, go. Whoa, whoa, where's he going? Come on, man. Let's just try to work this out, all right? Man to man. Let's try the two of us, all right? 'cause what? I... look, I'll give you the clothes, I'll pay you back, whatever you want. Come on, man, we can work this out. That's not the point. So... what is your point? The point is you have on a sweater underneath your sweater... I told you... That doesn't belong to you. I told you. I told you why, man. Because I was in the dressing room putting it on, and I heard the commotion with my son... Sir, relax... I came out to protect my son. Relax... I am relaxed, man. Sir... you don't seem relaxed, though. I'm, I'm totally relaxed, man. I'm just trying to work this out... Your tone of voice does not seem relaxed. I'm trying to work this out with you, all right? I said I'll pay you. Sir... I want you to back off right now. You are not going anywhere. I'm going... You are coming with me. What the hell is the matter with you, huh? What the hell's wrong with you? What are you, stupid? What, are you stealing jewelry for your girlfriend? Is that what you're doing? No, it was for mom. It's for your mom? For your mom? All right, just forget it, all right? Forget it. At least I got the new clothes, right? Yeah. Now, come on. Let's, let's go look for a job. Come on. What's the matter? Tell me. What? Oh, man. I left my money inside the pants in the dressing room. What are we gonna do now? I don't know. I don't know. If I go back in there, I'm gonna get arrested. Jesus christ. This is great, man. This is great. Hey, excuse me, do you have the time? 2:15. 2:15, great. Now I gotta get the deposit and a job. That's just great. All right, come on, man. Let's go, let's go. No. No. I can't walk. What do you mean? I can't walk no more. My stomach hurts. Oh, come on, your stomach doesn't have to do with your legs. Come on, let's go. No. I'm not going anywhere until I get something to eat. All right, we'll get you something to eat at the shelter. Come on. No, no, no, no. Come on. Don't be a pussy, man. I'm not a pussy. I'm not a pussy. Hey, don't do this to me now. Come on, man. No, no. I'm not... no. I'm not going anywhere until I get something to eat. I've been walking miles and miles and miles, and my stomach is growling. I'm... and my stomach is empty. I feel like I'm gonna pass out. Justin, come on, man, I swear to god... I want you to just get up right now. No. Justin, get up right now. Right now, you hear me? No. I'm done. I'm done. I don't care what you say anymore. Anymore. I'm hungry and I want something to eat. All right, all right, I'll get you something to eat, all right? Are you happy? Come on. Finally. I'm not eating shit from there. Are you listening? Yeah, yeah, I'm listening to you. Why can't we go to a restaurant? This is a restaurant. It's the back of a restaurant, man. At least try to find something that's wrapped. Yeah, I'm looking, I'm looking, man, I'm looking. Oh, bingo. Look. Look what I got. Look what I got. Look at this, look at this... a perfectly good little jelly donut. Here you go. It's frickin' hard as a rock. Yeah, it's just frozen, that's all. This is disgusting. You know, maybe if I hadn't listened to you and stolen the clothes that we could have bought somethin' edible, huh? I've been asking to get something to eat for the last five hours. You know, I knew I should have left you at the shelter, man, I knew it. Yeah, you should. Leave me right here. I'll get back to the shelter myself. Trust me, I'd like to leave you, man. This isn't my fault. Oh, no? Whose fault is it, man? Who got paint on my pants, huh? And I had to get new clothes? Was that my fault? Huh? Was that my fault? It's your fault we live in a shelter. What? What did you say, man? You know, you do this all the time. I'm not gonna let you get away with it. What'd you say? I said it's not my fault. No, that's not what you said. You said, "it's your fault we live in a shelter." I heard you. Think I'm a loser, don't you? You know how many families are struggling in this country trying to make it, man? A lot, o.K.? Wait till you got kids, boy. You're gonna see how goddamn hard that is. I'm not gonna have kids unless I can afford to take care of them. Oh, you got an answer for everything, don't you, son? Yeah, I have more answers than you do. You think I needed you in my life, man? You think, you think I needed the extra responsibility? You think I needed you? Yeah, you did. You did. Or you... or, or, or would you rather be with your real pops, huh? You think you're better off with him? Why don't you go back, man, so he could beat you up for no reason every fuckin' day, huh? Shut up. Just shut up. What, now you don't have an answer, big man? Huh? You had a big mouth, but when somebody fights back you have nothing to say? Is that what happened? I'm a bigger man than you. That so? Yeah, it is so. I can make more money begging in an hour than you can in a whole day. Whoa, you're a big man. Ooh. I can read. And I can walk all over the city for five hours with a broken ankle, and you can't even get out of the corner for three minutes and at least lose a fight like a real man. Gimme that. You don't want the donut? You don't want it? Excuse me, spare some change? Spare some change? Excuse me, can you spare some change? Excuse me, sir, can you spare some change?
