I hope you never have to hear this tape as that means we've left the farm. We moved here to this land to keep you safe and to help your mother get well. She isn't getting better. I fear she's getting worse. Come on, let's check the traps. I've got your coat. Right here. Shhh. I'm going to let you find the first trap, okay, Solomon? Hold on. Drop it in. Go on. Be careful! I'm sorry, Mother! What did I do? Nothing. Never mind. Okay, cut her in half. Good job, Solomon. You've learned well. Okay, now take one. Mm-hm. Excellent. Okay. Where? Good, go ahead. He's not jumping anymore. How long have you had him in there? Mm... Mm? Oh, Solomon. Creatures can't survive like that. They need to be able to breathe and eat and drink. You know what today is? What? It's your father's birthday. Oh. I thought maybe we could go fishing. He loved to take you fishing, remember? We could bake a cake. How's that sound? Really? Okay! Well, then come on. What happened? Nothing. Why? Where did the animals go? You're very observant, aren't you? I guess they went to find their own food. Maybe they thought we were hunting them. Or maybe they're as observing as you are and they went to warn the fish! Mama... What happens when we... die? Why are you thinking about dying? I don't know. Is that just like... the end? Oh, no, it's not... It's not really the end. It's more like a change. What kind of change? Well. You know, when a caterpillar turns into a butterfly? It's sort of like that. Life goes on but in a different way. Listen, you don't have to worry about that right now, okay? You're young and you're strong and you're going to be around for a long time. You know, I think we might have better luck catching fish if we had real worms instead of these plastic bobbers. I'll find some! Here! Hold this for me. Don't go too far! Solomon? - Solomon! - Ah...! Not to go too far! What are you doing? I... I was trying to find big ones. Here. I'm sorry. All right, sweetie, those are big worms but we are done fishing for today. We need to leave now. - I got one. - Oh, sweetheart. Good job. Keep going. Millie. How did you get loose again? Millie needs milking. I'll be right back. Come on, Millie. Shall we sing "Happy Birthday"? ♪ Happy Birthday to... ♪ Do we have to? No, I just thought it might be nice. I don't feel like it. Okay, well... maybe you just want to make a wish and blow out a candle. It's right in front of you. Yay, Solomon. What'd you wish for? I can't tell you. Hey! Cut it out! I love you so much! Once upon a time, near a tiny village beside a tiny bay, there lived a baby goat in a tiny woodland, far away. Mama goat and Papa goat loved their baby so. They nurtured him and kept him safe and watched him bloom and grow. Then Mama would sing a lullaby to help him fall asleep while Papa rocked him in his arms and Baby counted sheep. On and on, it went this way as baby goat grew old. He never wandered far from home always doing as he's told. Until one day he ventured off roaming far and wide. Climbing up and over hills and down the other side. Past the stream, into the woods where the canopy turns black. Further, deeper and darker he went until it was time to go back. "But which way to go?" he wondered aloud, unsure of how to get home. "What have I done? Where have I come? And just how far have I roamed?" Frightened and crying and turned all around, that's when he heard it, a terrible sound. A trumpet of. Or is it teeth? Slouched and crouched and hungry for meat. Baby goat ran with furious speed. Out of the woods, over the stream. Over the hills and down the path, closer and closer to home at last! Where Mama and Papa held him tight, loving him and hugging him with all their might. "You scared us!" They yelled, "You can't run away! We love you and need you and want you to stay!" Baby goat cried, hugging them back and promised to always be good. And always he was and never he did return to the darkened wood. I'm glad baby goat made it home, okay. Me too. He knew to get away from that terrible noise! He sure did. Solomon? Yes? You asked me earlier, what happens when we die. You said we change but I don't understand about the butterfly. That's okay. No one does, not really. That's what faith is all about. Faith? You remember when Millie got really sick and I said she might not make it? You said, "She might die," but I said, "No way!" And you were right. She got better. That's what faith is about. It's when you believe in something that you can't prove. You believe in it anyway even though you can't see it. I think that's your gift, Solomon. I have faith in a lot of things because I can't see anything. You are a good boy. Good night. I love you. Mama? Hmm? I have faith in you. I have faith in you too, Solomon. Solomon. Solomon, I am so sorry. I have to leave you now, sweetheart. I cannot stay here. You will have to be strong on your own like I know that you can. All you need to do is follow our three rules and they will keep you safe as they have always done. You remember our rules, don't you, Solomon? The first rule. We must always give back to the forest which provides for us. So when you hunt or scavenge, do it for two: one for the forest and one for you. The second rule. When your will is almost gone and you feel like giving up, find comfort in singing our song. The third and final rule, now, this is the most important of all. Solomon, you must never, ever let go of the rope. This rope is your guide. This land is your home. And the rope will keep you safe from harm within it. So always hold onto it and you will have hope. Whatever you do, don't lose the rope. I love you. Whatever you do, don't lose the rope. Millie, what happened, girl? Millie! Millie! Millie! Hey, boy, that's my deer. Stop. Easy, kid. I'm not gonna hurt you. - No. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Calm down. You're bleeding. Now, I'm just trying to help you, kid. How are we here? Your rope. I figured you must have something important attached. Wasn't expecting a house. Didn't want to lose it? Where are your parents, kid? Anyone else around here? I'm fine. I'm not... I'm not kid. 'Course you're not. I apologize. You don't seem like a kid. My name's Hank. Where's my rope? Rope's right here. I'll pass it to ya. Is your name Lucas? How do you know Lucas? I don't. I just saw his name on that knife. Is it Lucas's knife? It's mine now. Well, what's your name, then? Solomon. Hello, Solomon. It's nice to meet you. Please don't stab me. Here's your rope. No one answered your door earlier. Is anyone else coming back here tonight? I'd be more than happy to finish helping you clean up that cut. Give you a couple aspirin, in exchange for a place to stay 'til mornin'. Aspirin? Yeah, aspirin. You don't know what aspirin is? No. It's a medicine to make the aches and pains go away. Trust me, you'll thank me for it. I don't need your help. I can see that... but I need your help, Solomon. I'll be blind in them woods when that sun go down. And I don't have a rope like you. But I have a deer. I could make us both dinner. Uh... I'll take that as a yes, then. Solomon. Solomon, I am so sorry. I have to leave you now, sweetheart. I cannot stay here. You will have to be strong on your own like I know that you can. All you need to do is follow our three rules and they will keep you safe as they have always done. You remember our rules, don't you, Solomon? The first rule. We must always give back to the forest which provides for us. So when you hunt or scavenge, do it for two: one for the forest and one for you. The second rule. When your will is almost gone and you feel like giving up, find comfort in singing our song. The third and final rule, now, this is the most important of all. Solomon, you must never, ever let go of the rope. This rope is your guide. This land is your home. And the rope will keep you safe from harm within it. So always hold onto it and you will have hope. Whatever you do, don't lose the rope. I love you. I think it's ready! Thank you. Ya like it? Mind if I sleep in here by the fire tonight? Okay. Hey, Solomon. If you want to go with me in the morning, I could get you somewhere safe. I just mean, I noticed you were running low - on canned food and I could... - No. Okay, fine. I just wanted to offer some help. I don't need help. I love your home, too. And I wouldn't want to leave it either. Hey, uh, I noticed the picture of your mom and dad. You know, you look so much like your mom. I mean, just like your dad, too, but... so much like your mom. - I loved her. - Mm. I'm tired. Sure, of course. I'm beat too. It's been a long day. I'll clean up. The hell was that? Do you know what that was? No. Have you ever heard that before? I don't think so. You don't think so? Well, it didn't sound good. Let me get a flashlight. Where are you going? To see what that was. It stopped. Stopped what though? I don't want it startin' again. What are you gonna do? Depends on what it is, I guess. You just stay here. I'll be right back. A'right? Solomon? Do you know what kind of animal is out there? Do ya? I thought somethin' was gon' kill me. Tell me if you know what it is. Whatever it is, it was big enough to kill a bear. I mean, it wasn't a huge bear, but it was a bear and bears... It's okay, Solomon. We're safe now. I think. How the hell am I gon' get you outta here with that thing in them woods? It's nice. That song. Hey! Good morning! Thanks for letting me stay here last night. Do you know anything about what was out there last night? You know... there's a... lot of deer left over. I was just thinking I could show you how to preserve it. Have a little deer jerky around in the winter. Looks like you got a old smoker right here. That was my dad's. What happened to him? He left. I'm sorry, Solomon. Well, I see a... lot of materials around here. We could build a new one. And grate, some metal stakes. Yeah. I think... I can work with this. Now, do you happen to have a chain? Uh, I found one before. In the woods. But it's stuck. Stuck to what? I don't know. Well, you have some bolt cutters here. Can you take me so I can see? Yeah. I can... I can check my traps. Clever. Ah, there's nothing in your trap. It's pretty amazing to me how you move around so well with your rope. Mm. Rope is my guide. It's around here. Well, there's a whole heck of a lot of around here, Solomon. You gon' have to throw me a bone here, kid. Oh, it's right here! You were right, Solomon. It's right here. Does look like it's attached to something, doesn't it? Let's see what it is. I guess you're not coming? No. A'right, you stay right there. I'll be right back. Oh, shit! I don't know, it goes into some kind of den. I couldn't pull it out. A den? Some kind of hole in the ground. It don't really matter, though, I guess. We got what we need. Hey, uh... Will the deer fit? No, no, we will have more than enough left over to cook regular. Yeah. Can I have a piece? Yeah. I just said we have plenty. A'right, now. Solomon! What are you doing? Hunt and scavenge do it for two, one for the forest and one for you. What the hell is that? Witchcraft? You always throw dead animals out here? Uh, yes. Well, that explains why some animal was prowling around last night. What say you and I go find out what kind of beast that was while it's light out. I can't. You won't... I'll be right here to help you, Solomon... No, Hank! So you do remember my name? Why? Can't lose the rope? I can help you with that, too. You just have to trust me a little. Whatever is out there ain't gon' go away if you keep feeding it. We can set a trap for it. I mean, unless you just feel safe all alone out here, that's cool. You probably right. You got this under control, all on your own. How? How you got it under control? How can you help me? You can stay tied up just as safe with this. It will just give you a little more freedom is all. And you don't have to worry about my knots. I spent the first half of my life on a boat. You hear that? Strong like bull! Now feel it. Yeah! America-made! Strong like bull. Okay. 'Kay. Okay. All right, let me get one more thing. Come on. Let's go get this sumbitch. I got you, kid. Hold on. Let's go. Uh, is this where you seen it? Yeah, well, somewhere around here. I don't think it's around here now. I hope not. But between you and me, I think we've reached the end of our hope. Huh? It's a joke. Never mind. Old man, knuckle sandwich joke. Hank! Solomon! Hank! Solomon! Come on, let me get you outta here. Let me get you home. It's not safe out here. Come on, I got you. I got you. Come on, come on. Follow me. I got you. I got you, kid. We safe now. Don't worry. Whatever that was can't get in here. That trap will get it quick. You okay. Hold on. I saw somethin' last night. Was your mother's name Nye-dia by any chance? Nydia. Did you know she wrote a journal? What? I found her journal. "To the joy of my life, Solomon." And she signed it, "Nydia." What does it say? I don't know. You want me to read it? She had beautiful handwritin'. "Sunday. Happy birthday, Solomon. I cannot believe you are four years old today. How have four years come and gone so quickly? I broke down in tears last week when I realized you were not going to be three anymore. I told your father that I was heartbroken because I could barely remember you as an infant now." "He got this journal so I could write down all of the things we'd do together and not forget. He meant it as a gift for you. But I think it's more for me." "I doubt you will care as much about how cute your little fingers are in the grass..." "As you... try to catch a grasshopper or how your laugh can pull me from sorrow and transform me back to paradise. Your father and I love you so much, Solomon. Tuesday. I couldn't understand it. I was heartbroken. I don't know why. I just wanted to keep you safe. I think that's all any mother really wants. I told Lucas that you belong here. The ache for home lives in all of us, the safe place where we can go as we are and not be questioned. I don't think he agreed with me, though. He can seem so different from me sometimes. All I have to do is hold you close, Solomon. You console my heart. It dances in delight when we sing together." Just thinking of our lullaby can sooth my soul. I love you. Good night, Solomon." Hmm. Here we go. "Wednesday. I cannot believe he tried to take... What? What is it? Why'd you stop reading? Um, it's getting really late. Uh, that's enough for tonight. No, please, Hank, just some more... How 'bout we get some shut eye? - Not tonight. - Okay. Never, ever let go of the rope. This rope is your guide. This land is your home. And the rope will keep you safe from harm within it. So always hold onto it and you will have hope. Whatever you do, don't lose the rope. I love you. Hank? Hank! Hank! Hank? I cannot stay here. You will have to be strong on your own like I know that you can. All you need to do is follow our three rules and they will keep you safe as they have always... You remember our rules, don't you, Solomon? The first rule: we must always give back to the forest which provides for us. So when you hunt or scavenge, do it for two: one for the forest and one for you. The second rule: when your will is almost gone and you feel like giving up, find comfort in singing our song... The third and final rule, now, this is the most important rule of all: Solomon, you must never, ever let go of the rope. This rope is your guide. This land is your home. And the rope will keep you safe from harm within it. So always hold onto it and you will have hope. Whatever you do, don't lose the rope. Hank! - Hank! - I love you. Hank! Hank! Hank! Mother.
