Louisiana has seen many legends, and they're head over heels about a new hero. born Gavin Grey, they call him the gray ghost. here against Oklahoma, the ghost turns a broken pass play into one of those supernatural streaks that made him famous. his touchdown ties the game, but the ghost isn't finished yet. from the sooner 2, the ghost goes airborne. touchdown! and a sugar bowl victory. unanimous all-American as a junior, Gavin enters his senior season with the confident style of a champion. teammates and fans are ready to follow him as he reaches for even greater heights in 1956.

Gavin's the best. get movin'. where'd he play? I never heard of him. he played for some colored high school. man, he was so good. colored games and white games were both on Saturdays. pretty soon, nobody's going to the white games because they want to see blue play. switched the colored games to Friday, all on account of blue. he just played high school. don't matter where, as long as you play. quarter? quarter? that's my nephew. yeah, good cook, too. mmm. mmm! some yankee colleges was lookin' at me, but I couldn't write my own name. then I went up to Canada. they said they already had enough Americans playing up there. then I come on back and had me some police trouble. after that, I never give football one more thought... least, till I seen you play. I had to see for myself how good you really is. how good am i, blue? I expect you're about as good as me. ain't a cunt hair's difference between you. some things blue do better, but some things ghost better at. you can catch a pass better. but blue come off that ball fast. nobody beat you in the open field? nobody I ever run on. nobody's faster than Gavin. couldn't be. there's one way to find out. 20 bucks says ghost can whip your ass at 100 yards. make it 50, we'll see. well, shit, 50? make it 100. make it 200, by god! 50's enough. you want to run? whoo! where do you want to start, blue? down at the station. we going to run. get the pool started! get it started!

Gavin, they say I can't be in the miss Louisiana pageant. what? they gone crazy? they say they won't sponsor me unless I put off getting married for two years. they say I can't be married if I'm going to go on to miss America. we'll have to postpone the wedding. no! come on, Babsie. come here. you planned this all your life. I'm not going to make you give it up. I don't want to wait. I can't. oh, Babsie. oh, Gavin. oh, Babsie. I want to make love to you, baby.

[harp playing] you were saying about the value of a name... since I've been advertising on television, the name Bolling Kiely is almost as well-known as yours, ghost. a well-known name is money in the bank. lots of people would like to use Gavin's name. oh, don't I know that. Gavin's had so many offers. he'll go pro after he finishes school. first-round draft pick. I guess that means the redskins. lord knows they could use you. but it's never too soon to start-- let him eat his dinner. you and Babs can talk business later. Darlene's always telling me I still act like I'm leading college cheers. all right, I'll change the subject. I got you a wedding present-- a brand-new 1957 bel air convertible. your choice of color. it's a wedding present from me and Darlene to you and miss Babs. I can't accept it, sir. I'd lose my eligibility. well, no. I got that worked out. I don't give it to you. I lease it to you... for $1.00 a year. and that's irregardless of whether you accept my proposition or not. it's all legal. it don't matter if it's legal. sir, it's common. I can't accept your car, sir. I thank you for your dinner. [Gavin] Babs! excuse me. Gavin! Gavin, stop! wait! please! I'm sorry, Gavin. I was just thinking about our future. I didn't ask to be the gray ghost. I'm just Gavin, and I love you. but the ghost people think the ghost stands for something. you and me got to take care of it. oh, Gavin, I love you. it's all right, baby. yeah. now, come on, let's go. come on. come on. hey, Cake!

I bet on the big blonde. she must have screwed the wrong judge. Phyllis Smith Henderson. and our gracious queen of 1956, the bride of our own Louisiana immortal, mrs. Gavin Gray. [loud cheering] Magnolia Queens don't screw nobody. you ought to know, ghost. Cake, how'd you like to dive naked into them runner-ups? look at Babs. hmm. is that the gray ghost I see back there? let's get the ghost up here to give our new queen a big kiss. come on, ghost! come on up here! tigers win! pricks! go get 'em, ghost! I'm sorry, honey. there's only one Magnolia Queen. [cheering] Gavin! that poor girl! you've got to kiss her! I never thought you'd beg me to kiss another woman. woo! where the ghost going? he's not rushing off to be first in line at the buffet. go, ghost! hey, the south gonna rise again. don't fight me now. everybody's going to know what we're doing! good. oh, ha ha ha! what are we doing? ha ha ha! Gavin! honey, I'm lost in the clouds here. I can't find your little magnolia flower. stop it, Gavin! guess I'm just gonna have to fly by the seat of my pants. oh--eureka! will you stop it! nnneeoowwrr! hee hee! ha ha ha ha!

I want them for myself. whatever it takes, I want them. I'll put up a reward. you don't need no sweetener, ghost. if black men did it, I'll find out. damn it! he never hurt nobody. [sobbing] he didn't... he didn't hurt nobody. this is a very delicate situation. of course, we at the bank have the greatest respect for the ghost. perhaps we should have been more insistent on seeing him in person, but Mr. Lawrence kept assuring us that these matters were being cleared up. we have problems with mortgage payments considerably in arrears, plus the matter of some overdrafts and overdue loans. I just wanted to know what we've got in there. I'm very reluctant to discuss this any further over the phone, but I think you should know... the county assessor is placing a lien on your account. I'm truly sorry, mrs. grey. that's all. thank you. thanks. oh, goddamn it! goddamn it! [sobs] "oh, don't worry about it. it's nothin', Babsie. "everything's going to be all right. Lawrence can take care of everything." oh, god, why was I so stupid? [knock on door] [knock knock knock] who is it? [knock knock] get away from there. you get away from that door! go on! mrs. grey? I've got a gun. I'll use it. it's narvel blue, mrs. grey. the ghost maybe told you about me-- narvel blue? wha-- what are you doing here? I seen the car outside. thought maybe the ghost was here. he's in Washington. he had a colts game. can't miss the colts game. what do you want? it's about Lawrence. it wasn't black men killed Lawrence, mrs. grey. who was it? maybe never know who exactly, but I know why. well, come on in, Mr. Blue. I'm just getting drunk. you can join me if you like. no, thank you, ma'am. I got this man who work for me. had him some trouble once down in New Orleans. when he heard about Lawrence getting throwed through that window, he knew right off what it was. down there they got this code. a man welch on bets long enough with the wrong people, they beat him up, throw him through glass. that tells the police it's private business. these redneck cops don't understand that. they just yell "nigger." he was gambling? Lawrence gambled high, mrs. grey. everybody knew that. well, everybody but us. everybody but me! [crash] he robbed us! Gavin's best friend robbed us. we got nothin' left. this place is bankrupt. [sobbing] course, it ain't the best location in the world. it'll take money to fix it up. but if I'm going to buy this place, I must have the participation of the ghost. my money, your name. without the gray ghost, this place is just another restaurant. I told you, I'm out of the restaurant business. I'll have to be blunt. how long has this place been empty? [baby crying] I know all about the debts and the back taxes. whole damn town knows. ain't nobody gonna offer you what I'm offerin'. nobody. we have to talk it over. sure thing. boy, oh, boy, don't you look just like your daddy? [crying] what's your name, little fella? Lawrence. his name is Lawrence. I know. we can redo the decor in an old south style. that would be real different. ghost, I just want you to know that this is more than just business with me. I think you just hung the moon. Bolling, they need to talk. that jock-sniffin' bastard. I'd rather burn this place down than sell. that's a good idea, except we've got no damn insurance. Lawrence fixed that, too. well, I ain't gonna work for him. I ain't gonna do that to the ghost. the ghost has debts and could go to jail. I'm still playin' football, ain't i? for how many years, Gavin? one? two? you always said you were going to retire before you-- when I retire, I'll get out so fast, it'll make your head swim. well, we've got no choice, Gavin! we have got to take his offer. you want to run things? you run 'em, all right?

Terra Turf-- they make this artificial grass for football fields and stuff like that. I met this old boy, wants to pay me a shitload of money just to go around saying it's the miracle product of the future. you hear that, Babsie? yeah. that's great, Gavin. how much is a shitload? well... it's enough for me to tell Bolling Kiely to kiss my rebel ass good-bye before long. hi, kids. still watching Mr. Green jeans? yeah! yeah! hey, Cake? do you play golf? a little.

Giants was just flat hot that day. ghost. huh? oh, yeah. I'm supposed to be talking about terra turf. well, terra turf is the miracle product of the future, not only for sporting events, but for home use as well. such as your patio or... you and your sweetheart could get a real rug burn. come on, ghost, tell us about that Giants game. 3rd and 4 over Georgia 25. a minute to go. we're down by 6. uh, tell old Lawrence to... get that quarterback thinkin' about him, 'cause I'm gonna wet-dog that son of a bitch, and I'm goin' right up over your ass.

I've been offered a job up north-- full professorship at Lehigh. that's wonderful, Cake. yeah. yeah. I mean, it's everything I ever wanted. yeah. except I don't want to go. I feel like I'd lose something, not get it back. it's going to be strange having you away up there. I feel like if I left, when I came back, everything will have vanished. oh... oh, we won't vanish, Cake. we'll all just get older. here it is again. there's another pass. there it goes. all right! god! all those who said the American football league is a home for the lame and aging will eat their words today. make it to my friend joey. did he tell you about that Baltimore game? he tells this one real good. tell him. uh...colts was looking real good that day. we couldn't get a running game going. Unitas was kicking our ass as usual. stand there right by your picture. that's good. come on in, folks. that's good. yeah, that's right. a big handshake with a big smile. good. nice. thank you, ghost. you left us hanging there. oh, go fuck yourself. top of the eighth, a scoreless tie. nobody on, nobody out. here's the wind-up. ghost! ghost! I hate to bother you at home, but I've got to have a man-to-man about how much time you're spending at the restaurant. lord knows how proud I am to be in business with you, but-- doggone it! a deal's a deal! people think you ain't gonna be there, they don't come. I have had some complaints about how you're treating people down there. now, I worship the ground you walk on, but either you start living up to this deal, or I've got to take some kind of action. would you shut this damn thing off? [shuts engine off] ...traveling to St. Louis for a four-game series with the third-place cardinals. thank you. well, I'm real glad that we had this little talk. I'll see you down at the restaurant. hell you will. I quit! find somebody else's jock to sniff. how could you quit without telling me? broncos is after me. the minute I retired, the whole league was. Gavin, you can't do this. broncos are so fucked up, even their sock stripes are running the wrong way. but, Gavin, you retired. everybody knows I quit too soon, Babs. you want to get that restaurant back? this is our only chance. I'm doing it for you. don't you dare say that. we'd make it fine if you'd help out a little. Gavin, listen to me! don't do this to the gray ghost, Gavin. this shit, it's... it's killing me, Babs. the more I tell the damn stories, the more I feel like I'm just making it up, like it never even happened to me. the broncos-- they believe in me. I can help them out-- you're just postponing it. well, then, I'll just have to postpone them then. baby... you're going to love Denver-- you and the kids. I'm going to get there. I'm going to get us a real great place to live. oh, Gavin... I'm not going with you. me and the kids are staying here. I'll find a job. our life is here, Gavin. get up! trainer! trainer, over here. you once asked for his name for a chain of drive-ins, like blue boy. it's too late now, mrs. grey. then will you give me a job? I got 100 black men need jobs, black women, too. why should i give you one? because you need white faces, and I know this business, Mr. Blue. it was me that kept the gray ghost inn going all these years. what's it gonna do to ghost, as a man, if you're the one making a living? well, the living has to be made, Mr. Blue, one way or another. [moaning] hold on to the ball! hut! come on! get them! get going! score! get them! grey, take a rest. take a rest. get Upchurch in there right now at running back. here it is-- the old south. just the way you described it to me, professor. show a little reverence, will you? we're on hollowed ground here. yeah. I can see. that was the gray ghost inn. [beep beep beep] we're here. ha ha! oh, Cake! oh, my lord! ohh! I was going to change and have lunch ready. Gavin has been calling every five minutes, wondering where you are. you must be Leslie. welcome. I can't believe you're getting married. [telephone rings] if that's for me, say I'll call right back. it's been so long. oh, don't you dare come in my house until I get it picked up. wait just one minute. Cindy, help me pick this place up. your uncle Donnie's here. Cake? hmm? don't ask. take those dishes to the kitchen. Cindy? my god! has it been 10 years? is that really you? hasn't she grown? Cindy, say hello to Leslie. hey. hi. sorry. they both have jobs. tommy is actually engaged. oh, Cake, my lord! I may be a grandmother one of these days. oh, I'm just rattling on. I'm so sorry, Leslie. you must be exhausted. can I show you where to powder your nose? oh. my nose is fine, but I got to pee. just your typical blunt-speaking yankee. well, Cindy, show Leslie where the toilet is. come on. that was dad on the phone, mom. says Cake better get his ass down to the club. just quoting dad. Lawrence? uncle don. I cannot believe it. I told you that Gavin is golf pro at the club now. baby, run outside and get their luggage. yes, ma'am. excuse me. whew. she's real smart, isn't she, Cake? mmm. real pretty, too. so are you. you must have a pact with the devil. oh, bless your heart. narvel blue keeps me moving. he's running for the state legislature. I'm in charge of all his operations in the tri-state area now. that's great. how is Gavin? isn't that odd? whenever I say what a big success I am, everybody always asks, "how's Gavin?" hell, I've been doing just great, Cake... getting paid to play golf all day. of course, I'm only assistant pro here, but you know-- what the hell. I've been reading that book you wrote on Jeb Stuart-- the pride of the confederacy. you're a hell of a writer, son. oh, well. thank you, Gavin. thank you. you, uh, make any money off writing? oh, not much. it's just you publish, or you perish. how would you like to write a bestseller? oh, well. I mean, I'm not adverse to money. I talk it, you write it. we call it the gray ghost. well, that's, uh... that's out of my field, Gavin. hell, man. we'd clean up. seems like every damn jock ever lived nowadays is writing a book, and they're on tv, talking about how great they was. or how they overcome their drug habit or burned a living on 1.5 million a year. those kind of books. no. uh-uh. no. this is gonna be different. I mean, we tell them how it used to be. about what it really felt like to be a hero. mm-hmm. mm-hmm. well... Gavin, I'm real flattered. you're the only one I'd trust to write it, Cake. you were there, man. [Babs] we've just never tried to compete in that region. it's a great opportunity for us. if this guy had buyers beating down his door, he still wouldn't be talking to us, now, would he? narvel doesn't want to pay that price. neither do i. Cake, how do you like your steak? medium rare. so, don tells me this reunion is mostly a tribute to you. oh, hell. the old team wanted it. I said, "what the hell? as long as I don't have to make a speech." can't let the old team down. narvel wanted to get into the northern market. I never did, honey. look, he wants to sell. we want to buy, o.k.? it's as simple as that. now, you take him out tonight. you fill him full of bourbon-- what? then you use your charm on him. get off that damn phone. put some plates on the table. look, I've got guests. I've got to go. the victory over auburn meant we were all-systems-go for the sugar bowl, but next up was Alabama's tough crimson tide. what I did, Leslie, is I went through it game by game. you know, you must have an amazing memory. but we had us some problems. Gavin, I don't think Leslie is interested in the play-by-play. I'm giving her an idea about the book. if Cake's going to write it... are you going to write this book, Cake? I haven't said that I was going to-- here's a key play. I got the hand-off, headed straight through right behind Lawrence. gray ghost was... just off and running. no need to look back. ain't nobody gonna catch him. touchdown. you remember what that announcer used to say instead of "touchdown, grey"? you remember that, Cake? yeah. he used to say, "the gray... ghost." "the gray ghost." we played both ways in them days. let's talk about the wedding. turn that thing off, Gavin. well, honey-- turn it off. we had a game going. in the huddle... turn it off, Gavin. like he sometimes did. what'll it be, ghost? well, now, tell us what your wedding plans are. well... well... go ahead. we're not gonna make a big deal. we're just gonna go somewhere and do it. big weddings are out of date nowadays, aren't they? oh, yeah. hell, yeah. any kind of wedding. people today, they got the right idea. used to be, uh, if a girl got laid before she got-- oh, we all know what it was like in the prehistoric days. there was two kinds of girls back then, Leslie. you had your nice girls... then you had your punchboards. ha ha ha. nowadays, even nice girls like to screw. mmm. just like the nice boys, hmm? you got that right, yeah. all right, Leslie, let's go. I haven't played tennis in about 10 years. right. just get it across the net. oh. that's it. yeah. that's it. wow! yeah, "10 years." your girl is whipping my butt. you're gonna marry this girl, you got to get in some shape. what they been teaching you in yankee land? [Leslie] things you southern boys wouldn't understand. Leslie must think we're awful. oh, she thinks you're fascinating. is she good in bed, Cake? is she? well, yeah. sure. that's good. it helps. oh! are you doing that on purpose? I've got a bum knee. you really gonna write his book? would anybody care anymore? well, they might. he was the real thing. yes, he was. [telephone rings] Cake, how about a little shooter before the game? take it easy. you've got the game and the banquet. hello? I'm going upstairs. it's for you. I'll take it in the bedroom. hello? Babs, this is rick. hi. how did it go? oh, great. I knew you could do it. she's fucking somebody, Cake. can you believe it? some guy at work, probably. ain't that a bitch? Magnolia Queen. uh, give me one of those. [honk] where is everybody? let's get this thing over with! oh, Donnie. thank goodness. help me with this, will you, please? as many homecoming corsages I've pinned on, and I still can't-- Gavin thinks you're having an affair. are you? Gavin gets jealous now. he never even used to think it was possible. are you? tell me, Babs. no. oh, I get offers. I work with men, and men will make offers, but no. no affair. it's still just Gavin and me. I'm still as pure as Louisiana sunshine. except for me. or don't I count? you count, Cake. of course you count. come on. we have to go. I'm nervous enough already. oh, come on. my stomach's all tied up in knots. Gavin, just relax and let me drive. slide over. o.k. you remember this, Babs? thought you might want to wear it today. let's go. t-i-g-e-r-s! tigers! let's go, tigers! go, tigers! [band playing] Leslie, it's sweet of you to put up with this. are you a football fan? it's just not a religious experience at Lehigh. no. I don't suppose it is. return with us now 25 years into the past to 1956-- Dwight was in the white house, and America is learning how to rock 'n' roll, but to us Louisianians, 1956... there he is. see him? Cindy, dear, see your daddy? there's Gavin. please direct your attention to the west sidelines. most of the members of that team are here for the 25-year reunion. ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it for our 1956 national champion tigers! come on, boys. hold on, ghost. and now, the captain of that great team-- unanimous choice for all-American in both his junior and senior years, first-round draft choice for the Washington Redskins, where he was rookie of the year and two-time all-pro, a living legend-- he was number 20 in your programs, but number 1 in your hearts. make welcome, please, Gavin Gray, the gray ghost! [cheers and applause] [band playing] t-i-g-e-r-s! tigers! ghost, where are you going? oh, Donnie! Cake, go see if you can find him. see if he's all right. please, Cake. oh, Gavin. Gavin. Gavin! Gavin, what happened back there-- the kids are just all fired up about the game. at the banquet, it'll be your friends. I was just thinking about old Jeb Stuart, the pride of the confederacy. he was a pistol, wasn't he? Jeb Stuart embodied everything the south wanted to believe about itself. he was just 31 when he died. reckon how much of a hero he'd have been if he'd lived. Babs see me make a fool of myself back there? you didn't make a fool out of yourself, Gavin. I'm losing her, Cake. probably deserve to. this ain't the deal she made. oh, Gavin, stop it. you're just feeling sorry for yourself. she's not having an affair. it's all in your mind. how do you know? I asked her. that's kind of a funny question to ask another man's wife. Cake... did you and... no, Gavin. Gavin, no. I wouldn't-- you know I wouldn't. [cheering] we must've got 6. oh, uh, about that book, Cake... you just forget the whole thing. people nowadays got better things to think about. when they talk about the great teams, they talk about the 1956 tigers led by a legend. his name was Gavin Gray, but to friend and foe alike, he was always the gray ghost-- flawless, graceful, twice unanimous choice for all-American. he mowed down records the way he mowed down enemy defenders, but his greatness... cheer up, ghost. maybe they won't do this again for another 25 years. thank you, blue. it began with Vanderbilt. the commodores from Tennessee seemed to melt before a savage tiger running attack... sometimes... I wish I took you up on that offer of yours. tiger fans dreamed of the sugar bowl... just like to know what I could've done. more easy victories followed. then came the crimson tide. the Alabama boys were determined to break the tigers' winning streak. the first half our boys held one touchdown... hey, hey, blue. you want to race? no, no, no. the tigers began their drive sparked, as usual, by the gray ghost. the tide wavered... excuse me. I forgot my cigarettes. [cheering] there have been other championship teams, other great years, but none like that golden season-- unblemished by defeat, crowned by glory. [cheering] he asked about us today. I lied... but he knows. but time is running out. then, in the closing seconds, a desperate attempt pays off. Ed Lawrence forces a bulldog fumble, laterals to grey, and the ghost is off, running into history and legend and a tiger championship we'll never forget. [cheering and applause] go on. go ahead. it's now that counts, Babs. it's all that counts. ghost, I know we promised we wouldn't do this, but how about a few words? help get him up here. Gavin Gray, great all-American, the gray ghost! come on, ghost. get up. watching that last run back there in the sugar bowl, I was thinking to myself somebody should have shot me right then and there. [laughter] but nobody did. and I reckon I'm glad they didn't, 'cause there's more to life than making touchdowns. I used to know that. I guess I forgot it till this afternoon. but there's some things I don't want to forget. this was the best damn team there ever was. Bull Lawrence never missed a block. I just got all the glory. that's not why I played this game. I played it 'cause I loved it. and, Babsie... I've had a lot to love in my life, but because of you, I am the luckiest man that ever lived. let's go home, precious. ♪ now after all of the searching ♪ ♪ I see the answer in your eyes ♪ ♪ show me the way to stop hurting ♪ ♪ in a world that keeps on changing ♪ ♪ love's been known to disappear ♪ ♪ but I've got to have you here ♪ ♪ until forever ♪ ♪ this is for always ♪ ♪ if we're together ♪ ♪ nothing's gonna take that away ♪ ♪ until forever ♪ ♪ 'cause it was meant to be ♪ ♪ it's forever you ♪ ♪ it's forever you ♪ ♪ and me ♪ ♪ here is a heart that remembers ♪ ♪ we lost so much along the way ♪ ♪ oh, we'll build a fire from the embers ♪ ♪ though the road's uncertain ♪ ♪ there can be no turning back ♪ ♪ this love has got to last ♪ ♪ until forever ♪ ♪ this is for always ♪ ♪ if we're together ♪ ♪ nothing's gonna take that away ♪ ♪ until forever ♪ ♪ our love was meant to be ♪ ♪ it's forever you ♪ ♪ it's forever you ♪ ♪ and me ♪ ♪ I can't believe what we've been through ♪ ♪ oh, baby ♪ ♪ oh, this love has seen it all ♪ ♪ but nothing seems to break it ♪ ♪ I know we're goin' to make it ♪ ♪ until forever ♪ ♪ this is for always ♪ ♪ if we're together ♪ ♪ nothing's gonna take that away ♪ ♪ until forever ♪ ♪ this love was meant to be ♪ ♪ it's forever you ♪ ♪ it's forever you ♪ ♪ it's forever you ♪ ♪ and me ♪ ♪ oh, yeah ♪ ♪
