The Lord God said "let there be light". And there was light. The Lord God said "let there be man and woman". And there was man and woman. And that night man asked woman. Hey, are you free tomorrow night? And woman said... "Okay, let me check. But I'm not interested in anything long term. I want to see other people. Before I settle down with one". Cut! And man said... There are no other people in this world. And woman said... "Okay, how about this: We get married. You vow your eternal love for me. I expel a bunch of miniature humans. Who are totally dependent on us for eighteen years. You look for a job. And spend time with us at home every Saturday. Also, you'll never get to see another woman naked again". And man said... And the Lord said, "Why don't you two explore the world. Before telling me... Whether men and women can be together after all". And then thousands... And thousands. And thousands of years passed. Men and women... Show time!

I guarantee you'll be highly entertained by this extraordinary "big fun" experience. It's just matchmaking. It doesn't have to be so scary, does it? I said you'll have "big fun". Of course the scarier the better. Don't scare them. You look sharp. In order to live up to the horror of this game. Let me introduce. The main character this game. Granny Lung. Hi, everyone... I'm Granny Lung. Decades ago, I was referred to as Baby Lung. At that time, I was just like you two. Working in Central. As a white collar. Whenever I was free, I watched Korean and Japanese dramas with MyTV SUPER. MyTV SUPER existed back then? Why not? Don't interrupt. Fine, fine, fine. But for some reasons. No matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't seem to find my significant other. This feeling that I had. You should understand. Then came Christmas Eve. A friend of mine. Invited me to a Christmas party. I couldn't find a date to go with. So I went alone. As soon as I arrived, I saw everyone came with a partner. Couples everywhere. Kissing and cuddling. Calling each other cute names. Baby, "Piggy". Give me a kiss, Baby. Piggy, give me a smooch. Sweetie, try this mini franks. Darling, Honey. They even started talking like babies. Don't you think it's unbearable? I was so mad, I grabbed a AK47 out of nowhere. And killed all those jerks once and for all. After they died. Their souls lingered. They took revenge on me. That's why I can only be a medium now. People call me Granny Lung out of respect. In fact I'm just Lonely Lung. What are you laughing at? I'm almost eighty. But I don't have a soulmate. Is that funny to you? No, not at all. "For the Singles" And what about you, bitch? I apologize. Can we go now? I want to go. If you don't get married. You can never leave this prison. Are you still waiting. For Mr. and Mrs. Right to show up? Yes. Let me ask for you. They're dead already. What's your name? And what kind of partner are you looking for? Tell me all about it. Let me see if I can help. My Chinese name is Chung King Fai. English name, KFC. They all call me King Fai Ching, I'm 34. I'm looking for a young Christian girl. Who wants to get married and have kids with me. And you? My Chinese name is Kam Kung Mun. English name, Madonald, I'm 24. What? 42... So young. Will you marry her? How about you? Well... yeah... Speak up. Let's get married! "Congratulations" Congratulations. Congratulations on escaping this prison.

That's so nice, my parents woke me up so early today. Hang up now. - Byebye. - Byebye. It tastes better than Mommy's breakfast. Little brother, you scored number one on Planetii this month. Yes!

"On the highway of love" "They are driving us insane" Everyone, as men. We are most annoyed. When our wives keep nagging us while we drive. I wish one day there's a company. That produces a car. Like the one in "Kingsman". Once I press a button. I can shoot my wife out of the car. Together with the seat, into a land far, far away. It'll be a highly profitable business. Thank you very much. "Once we start the car, the marriage goes to hell" "We're losing our grip on this family trip" "On the highway of love" "Our fights are high-octane" "On the highway of love" "The marriage is rocky" "On the highway of love" "Forever shall we reign" Stop kissing. You hit someone. Ma'am, are you all right? - I'm fine. - Are you hurt? It's all right. Why are you sitting on the ground? I'm in a hurry. - Watch it. - I didn't hit her. Yes... I've seen you act before, you are... Your name is... I'm a makeup artist. You can call me Mo. Take a seat. Mo. Mo, please make me look prettier. What do you have in mind? You think you are an award-winning actress? Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the dating show that might change your life. Finding True Love. I'm your host, Yam Wing Chuen. In this show, everyone will be able to find... The better halves that can enrich your lives. Hi, I'm from Zhuhai, Guangdong. My name is Jenny. What kind of music do you like? Classical music. What kind of guy appeals to you? I like guys with good sense of humor. Travel around the world with me if you like me. That's wonderful. A perfect match. A perfect match. Up next, we have... The last lady waiting for true love. Hello, everyone, I'm Mrs. Li. Silly me. I'm Wong Oi May. You can call me May. Li is my husband's surname. But he's dead. He's actually not dead. We are divorced. But I'm much happier, thinking he's dead. That was a fantastic introduction by Miss Wong. I, Wong Oi May, am a divorcee. I'm divorced. Divorced! Actually, I still love him. No way! Can we not talk about divorce? During my divorce. It felt like having a heart surgery. But without anesthesia. It's like I'm cut open, with my lungs and guts spilled everywhere. Am I a good speaker? You've been staring at me the whole time. You must be falling for me! I know I'm the one you want to choose! May, let's talk about your job. All right... I work as a telemarketer. Those who ask if you need money and get hung up on. It's such a fulfilling job, I also attend a locksmith class at the community centre. Locksmith and aerobics classes were the only available ones. I thought by attending the locksmith class, I could pick up a few more guys. But damn it. The class was full of desperate women. In this classroom, desperate women were learning how to break locks. In that classroom, old guys were learning how to dance. Do you have kids? Yes. Almost forgot to mention, I have a kid. Will this make things more interesting? I hope you won't find children annoying. Although I do. I don't hate my son. How could I? I only hate my heartless husband. Who abandoned the family when I was fifty two. So I have to raise my child alone. Did I just blurt that out... I was dumped by my husband? Do you want to date a divorcee? Give it a try, it feels great. That bitch. She's not even twenty yet. Young enough to be his granddaughter. She looks just like a snake demon. With eyes bigger than Avata's and chin sharper than La tour Eiffel. I had many sleepless nights. Why? I can't figure it out. I can't let that bastard affect me anymore. Everything happened because of him. Choosing the snake demon. Over his wife of twenty seven years. He said. I love her more. Then he left. My world stopped. Everything stopped. Miss Wong. That was very touching. Would you like to make a shorter speech? It's fine. If you agree with what I said. Then pick me. Pick me. If you think otherwise. Then forget about it. "Finale" "Amazing Grace," "how sweet the sound..." Sau Mau Ping, "Good Times". Huh? Last month, after Wong's funeral. The consolation feast was held there. We sat at the same table. Do I know you? You're Fan, right? And you are... I'm Chan. Hello, Chan. This seems like a nice funeral. Who's it for? You don't know who the deceased is too? I'm here for the funeral right next door, I'm just a little bored. So I thought it'd be nice to pay my respects here as well. To be honest, I also don't know this person, I just accompanied my girlfriend. That's nice of you. Do you want a pork bun? Huh? Right, it's not too appropriate to eat here. My wife's funeral was done here as well. We were married for forty something years. Really? Is this where your husband had the wake? How would you know my husband passed away? Just had that look about you. I can also tell you miss him. Was his funeral held here? His funeral was held in "International Funeral Parlor". Two and a half years ago. International is nice. Their seats are nice and soft. Right, much better than the ones here. Fan, are you seeing anyone? This is a funeral. Even though we don't know who this is. We shouldn't behave like this. I'm sorry, I don't usually do this, I just seem to be going to a lot of these lately. So... my apologies. You like pork buns, right? Winter Garden in Yau Ma Tei. Serves pork buns in a set of four. And they're huge. Really? We should go there sometimes. Chan, is this a pickup? What are you talking about? You'd have to agree to a date. In order for it to actually be a pickup. Right now. It's just an attempted pickup. You seem like a funny man, I don't really go out like you're intending.

I can't, Chan. I'm not that type that just hops right into the bed. Like some of the women in the elderly home. I don't do one night stands. It takes time with me. That's a problem. What problem? Depends on how much time you're talking. If you're talking years. I don't think either of us has that long. I suppose I'm talking a few weeks. "No matter, I can live with that" "I'll see Man, when I go to heaven" "I promise to meet Wan, in just a moment" "He (she) is still in my heart" "Things we've been through" "The promises we've made" "But I'm still here" I'll always miss my Man, I'm always thinking of my Wan. I just don't know... It's normal, because I don't know either. "I'm still missing her" "No matter" "We can live with that" In this city familiar to all of us. This is how the story of man and woman shall be written. With one truth that shall remain eternal. All ye good people of earth. Find someone to love, someone you think is perfect. Then spend the rest of your life trying to change them. And tell him (her) I love you! You are perfect!

Wait, I haven't tried this one on. And this one too, I'm trying them on. Hey, Honey! Honey. When will you finish watching the game? Just one more minute. So when will you be done watching? What the hell? That's ridiculous, I've made a lot of effort learning the game. I know you like it. Honey, hurry up. Otherwise we'll miss the ferry back to Shekou. I'll take this too. Honey, even if you buy more bras. You won't get bigger boobs, or grow taller. Or get prettier, hurry up.
