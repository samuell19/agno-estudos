Music by Cinematographer Written and directed by Let us listen to the way the wind blows... It tells a sad tale of Muscovy land... I've left my babe on Muscovy land... There I've become a prisoner on a fine wonderful night... The tears of my old parents flow so abundantly... That they make the brook flood... The flood of tears whirls violently... My sweet parents are crying for me... The tears of my old parents flow so abundantly... That they make the brook flood... The flood of tears whirls violently... - Yes? - Don't enterthere, grandpa's inside. - Come right back, you! - It's nothing. - Oh, mother... - Come on, quick! Don't speak now... Uh huh. Nothing. What? Wait. Wait. Don't hang up. Tell it to me now. Wait... wait. That's it. Speak now. Say what? Who'll be there?.. Don't be kidding me, that's awesome. Cool. Good, good, rad. But what will I say at home? No, can't do that. Okay, okay, fine. l'll hang up now. Cool? Bye. The tyrant can only contain my body... For my soul is flying high above the mountains... Above mountains and valleys, my wings spread... Fluttering at my babe's window... The tyrant can only contain my body... For my soul is flying high above the mountains... Above mountains and valleys, my wings spread... I'm gone. Ticket, please! - For when ? - The latest possible. - Where are we traveling to ? - To school. Fine. Any tickets here that I've missed? Thank you. It's a go! Tickets please. I'll be damned... Halt, halt, catch that hooligan! Come back, you hooligan! L'll cut your head off! Didn't your mother educate you? - Hands up! - Murderer! See you, my son. And make sure to behave. Here! Look up! Look here! What's up, Gruber? Come already! We need to do some cool lighting that would attract the girls. Gruber man... Please hurry up, granny, or else we'll never make it there. Go ahead, granny, stop talking so much, your stomach will get cold. - I'll tell this to your father! - I could tell him about you too. So let's just leave at that, kindly go in there, that's it, attagirl. - Marijuana, marijuana... - Mambo marijuana! I'll put on this; Lehel Nemeth... Erzsi Kovacs, just like America... Hey, anyone take a sip? Pear brandy. No, thanks. What's up ? My mother drinks it too. I'll put it away then, you had time to think. - Want some? - Uh huh. Drink up. It's pretty good. Look, it's Teddy and The Club. Cool enough. Put this one on, not the other one. It's rad. Wait, not yet. Gimme the phone. Hallo, Green's here. Green, I said! - Tell it already! - Alright, so... What did I wanna tell you? Is it better now? I said, is it better now? - Speak up. - The rest won't come now? Relax, they'll come; if Green said they will, then they will come. Listen, what are you doing right now? Washing dishes? Your what? Your girlfriend is there as well? - Tell him to bring her along. - Good, bring her. - Sure. - Sure. - The mood is all festive here. - Awesome. You're the only ones missing. Yeah, you're here in half an hour. Cool. Ciao. Come on, tell me already. - Are they coming? - Sure! Rudi! I won't betray you, just let me out of here! I'm coming, coming, granny, no need to shout! - Duh. It's no good being in there. - Please go inside. They've come! The awesome chicks are here! I've invited all of them. - Ciao. - Ciao, chicks. - I don't wanna go back there! - Granny, go back inside! - Tell me who are here? - No one is here, granny. I'll tell yourfatherthis time; and also that you're not in school! Is this granny's biggest problem now, school? The school's been demolished anyway. Rudi! Let me out of here! - Don't want some? - What's that? Pear brandy. It's very good. Winkler's mom drinks it. And me too. - Sziszi, listen! - I meant to say that... Hey... Have you seen Pussycats? They say it's a rad movie. Of course; I watch all those movies. Lately I've only been watching 'R' rated films, really. I don't know about other folks, but the rest simply don't entertain me. They fail to excite me. Like last time, I sit in there, all I see is kissing and stuff... They're not even petting each other, that was all. &nbsp; - Dad, can I go as well? - Do I care?.. Sit right down. But this is my spot here. Remove the cork! Uncle Dezso... can't we watch it in color? I can't even watch it in black and white anymore... Okay, wait a minute then, I have a little surprise. Not like that, upside down! What don't you see? Here I am! Pour me a little wine! Dear viewers, for those of you waiting patiently for the evening's main event, we wish you a great time: tonight's surprise is coming up! Part nine: The secret weapon. Jacques and Francois have prepared a rope! They intend to escape, right? Right, tonight! I've overheard their snitch Francois. He spilled the beans on their plans. We have no other choice: breakthrough! - What do you want? - I've heard yourtalk with Schmidt! - Traitor! - Let me go! I'll call the guards! Halt! All of you continue your work! Look there! Catch that man! - Shoot him! Shoot him! - Help! How can I serve you, ifl may? Sir, I'd like to have a tuxedo for my kid here. And what sort do you have in mind? What do you mean what sort? Dark blue, what else? Then may I offer to you this one? Or how about this one? Divine material. Or this? May I kindly ask the young gentleman to try this one on? And its material, dear sir, it's simply not even a material. It's fine fabric; and if I'm allowed to note this honestly: it fits perfectly on the young gentleman. - That's it, it will do. - Dad, this is completely... I said it will do. You may pack it in. Yes, sir. Where is its hair? Look at this! - Dad, look! - Nandi, Balazsl Get out of the water, just look at them! Oh my God, come on out! Where is the chain now? In the pawn shop. Where is the pawn ticket? That's what we sold. With the pawn ticket we can change the watch what mom bought. We need to get the watch back to the pawn shop. No, we don't. It's a golden watch. How much did they give for it the last time? I don't know. Well, we need to sell something! Something! - Maybe the tape recorder then. - Not that, if possible, not yet. - Orwe could get a loan... - We already did. Or perhaps we won't pay the gas bill: if he didn't show up until now, maybe he'll skip us this month. How many are there in the pawn ticket? I don't know. Two or three of which expired. And what is not can be extended. You're talking to me as if I am the cuplrit in all this! No, you just asked something and I was brave enough to answer! Leave it! Congratulations, “leave it” is the simplest possible solution. Alright, I'm done as far as I'm concerned. - And I'm not done! - Good, you're not. The city is dreaming: a poem by Erno Gruber. The city is dreaming, and so am I. My wistful desires: a blonde woman, a rumpled pillow, will find me against all odds. Lady of my dreams, you have no idea that I'm yearning and frustrated; pulling your hand to my heart: amen. Whatever. I'm gone. Where are you going this time? You'll be home at 8 the latest! - Thank you, see you later. - See you. - Good day. - Hello. Please give me two... three blue cigarettes. - Three blues. - Yes. - Thank you. - Intended to whom? My father. 45 fillers. Thank you. Goodbye. Please tell me: do you have a smoking hedgehog? - Here it is. - How cute he is! - Do you have a razor sharpener? - Not at this time. I wish we had it, I could sell a thousand per day. What about you? What are you doing here? What's up? Place closed yesterday. My train went away, and I don't have later trains to catch. Where are you from? Martonvasar. That's good. Does your father have wine? Yes. Good. Tell him I'll pay him a visit. - You can't do that now. - Why? He's gone. Gone? So what? Where? - To Zicsi. - Where? - Zicsiujfalu. - What for? Well, she got a new wife. And we stayed behind in Marton. Well? Mr Teacher... I forgot what we studied the last time. - Rhumba. - You'll learn it some day. - But I need to know it by tonight. - What for? - Because I promised. - To whom? My brother: he's in fever, and he promised me that if I teach him how to rhumba, his feverwill subside. And you have one of those brothers who keeps their promises? I do. Alright, come on. Quick, quick, slow. Quick, quick, slow. Quick, quick, slow. Quick, quick, slow. Quick, quick, slow. Quick, quick, slow. If my mother saw this... It's good. - Two forints. - What's two? What do you mean what's two? The lyrics. - When it's done! - No. Now. Now, now, now, now. - It's not 'speery', it's speedy. - Do you or do I write it? - Fancy one? - What's that? A strong one, the only one I smoke now; can't find Fecske in the entire town. Fancy one? Leave me, monkey, can't you see I'm busy? Listen here, when I die, a marble plate will declare that within the walls of this high school Sztasni the cool spent seven unforgettable years... my jacket. Yes! Listen, I was already enrolled in here when your mom and dad forgot to go to the movies; so don't you yap to me about a crew. Watch it, like this! - It's not 'speery', it's speedy! - Speery! Ombodi, Gerendas, Dekan, Vilezsavoszi, Frici, Tuske and Tarnoki: it could fight any other crew anytime. - Show it to me! - Don't grab it! You stop that! Two forints! Get out of here! I have one like that at home. It's Canadian. Good for you. Ow, my ears! Too late now. Here, here! “I'm walking down the gypsy camp...” All you criminals, get out! Get out! Damn! Watch at the door! Watch your shoulders! You'll be dilapidated if you don't take care! Fon/vard, that's right! There'll be a right turn! I don't care a bit! The heaters will haul it away tomorrow morning! Alright then! Little ladies, little gents! Line up facing one another in a single row! According to height! To height, I say! According to height! No matter what class you belong to, just height! - Who you ended up with, Gruber? - Ica Jeger. She descends to a mine, the coal comes up on its own. - She ain't that bad! - Quiet, line up! - Kisses, Bozsike! - Ciao, Rezsoke, ciao! No unnecessary excitement needed! Alright now! Little gents! I said, little gents! Advance four steps towards the little ladies! Relax, don't get overexcited here! Silence! Silence, order, attention! Relax, no unnecessary excitement! Alright now! Each little gent presents himself to the little lady. Little gents wait until the little ladies hold out their hands first. Little ladies are first to offer their hands, there you go! I am the little lady: Erzsi Bakats. Breast out, stomach in. Little gents offer their right arms to the little ladies. And they accept them. Promenade, promenade. Walk straight! - What is it? - My hand is sweating. Your what is sweating? Tag! Stupid! Your gaze is into the future. - What the hell do you want? - Nothing, nothing. It was an accident; I meant to say, tag! Leave it or I'll bury you like the snow does Moscow! You were good, good. - What, your hand's still sweating? - It is! Still sweating. Promenade, promenade. Stop! Alright now! Little ladies and little gents now face each other. Little gents hold out their left hands, little ladies place their right hands onto those. Then little gents use their right hands to embrace the waists of the little ladies; theirwaists, I said! And not like this, as some little gents imagine it! Not like this, not like that! He could grind a kilo of poppy smooth in 15 minutes on that one! And not like this either, as some little gents imagine it! Because some little gents have a very vivid imagination! Alright then, I'll show you the new moves! Little ladies will watch the girl steps, little gents watch the boy steps! Slow, quick, quick, close! Slow, quick, quick, close! Left, right, left, close! Left, right, left, close! And this is what tango is all about! Right, everyone try it without music first! Three, and: slow, quick, quick, close. - What, your hand's still sweating? - Yes, it still is! Sometimes it always is sweating. What happened? I don't know, all I remember is that my classmate, Erno Gruber, suddenly broke through the door, and immediately killed two of my captors. And then? I can't remember how I made it to safety, only that he put me in his arms and he dashed with me through the building. - Yes. - I don't really know where to. And that we were pursued throughout. And they were shooting continuously. And all I can think about is Erno Gruber saving my life, and as long as I live, I'll be grateful to him. - What is it? - What's up? Are you sick? You don't know anything about anything yet! Slow, quick, and enough! Alright now! Each little gent turns over by two little ladies. A woman is waiting for you outside! Quite a cutie too! There's no woman out there! Well, if there's not, there's not! - Mariska. - Don't tell me, I know. He was as big as our dog; I go, stay put, quit acting so macho, I hit him hard and down he goes. Hey, hey, what're you doing in the corner? Tell me, do you ever attend hockey games? No, all I attend are choir sessions. But, but some of those games are so awesome out there... But it's cold, because ice is cold, right? It's cold. Alright now! - Do you ever attend boxing matches? - No, not those either. We will now present the boy steps and the girl steps. Little gents start to the right. Quick, quick. Then he steps one more to the right. Slow. Left fon/vard, slow, slow. Quick, quick, slow, slow, slow. Step and cha cha cha, and step and cha cha cha. Alright now! All of you together, to the music! Three, and: step and cha cha cha. What shit is this? Still sweating? Yes, still is. Sometimes it sweats all the time. Step and cha cha cha, and enough. Alright now. Each little gent moves right by two little ladies... - Hey! - Hey what? Right! Glide on! - I'm Mariska. - Leave it, we know each other. Promenade, promenade. - What is it? - What do you mean what is it? I'm coming here to blow my nose. Just keep playing the organ. Promenade, stop. And now we review what we learned the last time. Let us see the devil of the tempo! The king of the rhythm! Let us see... Twist! Imbecile. Well now, ladies and gentlemen, let us see... foxtrot. This dance is enchanting, and the secret of it all is the eight! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Watch my feet, because I'm cheating! And the eight, and the eight. Promenade, start! I've had a piano lesson today, and I'll have my exam concert soon in the music school, imagine that; and if you insist, you can come see me play. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... where? - Well, to the music school. - Oh, I'm sure that'll be swell. Ow! - Rezso, wanna drink something? - Two mixed shots. Two? What, the music sucks. Can't dance to that. What, four? Don't do that. And you come over here. You're not supposed to shuffle orjump around like a circus horse, but glide! I'm lifting my head up! I keep my back straight! I gaze into the faraway! And the eight, the eight, the eight... And the glide, the glide, the glide. May l'_) What does this monkey want now? I did'n't even allow him to. I wish you dropped dead. May l'_) - Who, me? - I asked, may I? Come on now. Jerk. Hi there, imagine this, I've had a piano lesson this afternoon. And soon I'll have my exam concert; you can come if you want. May l'_) Little lady, allow me to introduce the little gent. Madame! Well? Virag Fekete. Gru... Gru... Gruber Erno. What now? - This wasn't eight, just seven. - No, it was eight. I swear. - Are you sure? - I think so. You little mental arithmetics master! You're an expert in this, machine-gun feet! That's it! And enough. Alright now, as a means of relaxation, let us continue with an old favourite, the slow dance. And step, close, back, step, close, fon/vard. - It's totally good here. - Say what? - It's totally good here. - I'm bored. Me too; you have a sister, right? - I do have a brother. - I know him. - He goes to Petofi or some place. - He escaped to the US in 1956. I know, Iwas told; listen here. I mean to tell you... - Have you seen Boccaccio '70? - The what? The, how should I say it, you know what... - Pussycats and The Bee Queen. - Sure I saw them. Listen to me, I want to tell you something. Shoot. You know, when the dude went up to Lollobrigida in the film, and she didn't notice him, and when the dude embraced her shoulder... you know that scene... - What? - You know what they did. - What, snogging? - You can put it that way. And they looked awesome doing it, huh? I'm sure. Itjust crossed my mind, whether or not you could do like in that film, if I happened to be Lollobrigida. - Do what? - Well, you know what... - Oh, snogging? - Well, sort of, yes. And... what would I be doing. If I were Lollobrigida in the film. Were you the one who wrote those poems to me? You mean me? What poems? The lady of dreams above the whirling waters... Actually, I wrote that to myself. I didn't even show it to anyone in the world... just Winkler, and he took it from me. I was just fooling around... - Are you sure? - Of course, it was stupid. And were you the one who wrote that poem in the school journal about a black flower? - Well, yes or no? - Yes. Then why didn't you come to me until now? - The entire school laughed at me. - Forgive me. - I didn't know... - Why didn't you talk to me? Because I was scared... scared that you might diss me. If I want to, it can still happen. Am I clear? But I don't want to now. It might be a stupid thing to say... but I feel happy right now. - Leave me alone! - Hey, hey. - I was just dancing with Ibi. - Hear this? Do you consider that a dance? Then who was the one to prod and poke her during the rhumba sequence? I didn't do anything to her. We were just practicing rhumba. Now you kindly kneel down to us and say: My dear, good Slici, I beg to ask your forgiveness for acting like that with your girl, and I swear that I won't do it again. - What is it now? - I won't say it! - Kneell - On your knees! Give me his ear! Let me go! I beg to ask your forgiveness for acting like that with Ibi. I swear I won't do it again! Alright, that was smart. Knock on his head! What's it now, machine-gun feet? - Let me see! - I can't see a thing. - Kisses, Bozsike. - Greetings, dear. Ow, ow, dear Lord, who are flying up in the Heavens. Your body rests in my arms, bullets breeze around us... The world is revolting, the world is revolting... Jesus, my fly, it must be open... Your body rests in my arms... Alright then, little ladies, little gents, single row line-up according to height! According to height... I said according to height! Hurry, hurry, let's do this. Little gents towards the little ladies: advance three steps! Right, left turn! Promenade, promenade. Promenade, promenade, stop, enough. Alright now, I have two news... one good, and one even better. The first is: collective dance! The second is: mambo! Am I allowed? The lady of dreams above whirling waters; her blonde smile ascended to the skies; below her, a filthy city, a smelly slough; a lonely cry parts from my soul; I am soon to sleep now, a blonde lock of hair threads my dream; I'll be a god, my sweet little world. Sorry, may I? Get lost. Excuse me, may I? Now? No! What do you mean, no? What does it mean? It doesn't exist, hear me? It's not valid. - It is valid. - But it cannot be. Scram, little boy! Listen, this is invalid! This is out of line! Alright now! With this unforgettable cha cha cha, today's dance class comes to an end. We'll meet again, like always, next Sunday afternoon. See you later. Ibi, come on already! - I hope you're not mad at me. - No, just go now. Now! Where do you think you're going, machine-gun feet? Where do you hurry? Right now when we're going to a rad new party? You're coming along, right? Off we go! Let's go! At home you'll say you were on a theology class. Come on, monkey, you won't regret it. Come, hurry UP! Don't fall behind! I told you, this is a good guy. Told you, right? Don't be fretting now. You were quite a show-off, machine-gun feet! - Come on now! - Wait for me. - Look there! - Where is Green? Come on already! Thanks. Careful! What's up, machine-gun feet? Fancy one? - Yours to take. - Thanks. I only have two left. I smoked so much, my spit is made of asphalt. What is it, guys, how does the job fare? - Fancy one? - Thanks. Fecske? This is what you smoke? Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Thanks. Well, what's it? Who's next? Where's machine-gun feet? Where's my little protege? - Machine-gun feet! - Come here! There you are, come here! Stand in place. Well?! Well?! Machine-gun feet... Goddamn animals! Erno, is that you? Where've you been until now? - Erno... - Go back to sleep, mom. - What happened to you? - Go to bed. - Don't yell, don't yell. - Come quick, my God! - Leave it! - Erno, what happened? Dad, come quick, what could've happened? Oh, my God! - Nothing has happened. - What's going on here? Go to bed, both of you, everyone go to bed! Sweet Lord, look at the state of you... Where have you been? My God... - Nowhere. - What have you been doing? - Nothing. - Good God, your clothes... - Your clothes! - Go to sleep, dad. Where have you been? What did you do? You hear me? Answer me, God damn you! What on Earth?.. Dad! Starring
