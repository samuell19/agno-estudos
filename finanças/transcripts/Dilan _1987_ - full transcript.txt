Dilan Dilan, I'm losing my patience. I've made up my mind. I don't care what'll happen. There's no other way, it must be tonight. Don't act fresh, tiresome brats. You won't get one bite until your father's here. Get lost, donkey colts! By God, do you intend to feed your future husband with your dowry! Isn't it enough yet? I've lost count by now. We're starving, and all you think of is your dowry. You no longer listen to any of us. You're more touchy than a Bey's daughter. You no longer even see us. Look at the state your siblings are in. They're like sparrow chicks fallen from their nest. All I want is your well-being, my beautiful daughter. This morning when sweeping the doorstep ... the things Hazer told me, they'd drive even a dog mad with rage. What if your father had heard! He'd be shocked. Why look at me like that, daughter? Did Hazer tell a lie? So now you're listening to that louse Hazer! And I'm to keep quiet and swallow that louse's words? Is anybody asking you to? It's just the way people gossip. What has the louse been telling again? She didn't mince her words. They hit me like arrows. "Who knows how many sweethearts she's meeting, in the hills, by the brook", she said. You don't need a sweetheart, daughter! You're too young. Why get married so soon? What'll happen to us when you leave? And what does she mean by "many sweethearts"? As far as I know, a girl can only have one sweetheart. What's going on, daughter? Even the sparrow has only one mate. Are you lower than a bird? Do you think you're a man who can have many sweethearts! Mother, but you yourself had many sweethearts too. Didn't you tell me how Kerim courted you in the hills ... how what's his name sent you a mirror ... how others, whatever their names, were burning with love for you. I have two sweethearts, it's true. But you even forgot how many you had. And they were reckless too. But did I ever turn my head and look at them? As to yours ... What's wrong with mine? Tell me. What's wrong with mine? But they don't stay quietly in their nests. Or do you imagine I'm running after them? My sweethearts are daring, brave, not timid like yours. I get it. Your sweethearts are braves, and mine were just sissies. Mine were brave too, in their time. Then I chose your father. Why? First, because he was honourable. Hard-working. A good shepherd. With a beautiful voice. Because he was the best flute player. And what about yours, daughter? I know that Mirkan is honourable. But honour doesn't fill your stomach these days. And how will he manage once he's married you? As to Paþo Bey, we'd better not mention him at all. He doesn't suit us. Or rather, we don't suit him. He's a Bey. And we're just slaves at his doorstep. Don't trust his love. The love of a Bey is like a summer rain. It's quickly over. Today he loves you, tomorrow another. A Bey is insatiable, no riches or women are ever enough for him. Forget about both of them. You're still young. Why fly from the nest so soon? Either today or tomorrow I'll talk to your father to find a way. What's her name? Ah, Dilan. Within a week Dilan shall be in your bed. Enjoy her for a year or two. And after that we'll find you a girl from a good Bey family. I don't want any other girl, mother. You will, my son. You will. Your father once told me the same. When I could no longer arouse him. He took not only one, but two wives. And you too will do so one day, my son. I'll see to it that the girl will lie in your arms in a week. Those a just your words, mother. Father would never agree to such an affair. And if I were in father's place I'd feel the same. Just think: the son of a Bey leaves his clan and falls in love with a shepherd's daughter. In any case, father's right. He's not only thinking of his own honour but that of his clan. And so am I. But what can I do? I curse my heart's desire! Well, Halil Agha. You haven't even asked why we're here. Welcome to my home. I feel honoured. In our custom we only ask a guest why he came after three days. Halil Agha, God and the Prophet willing, we've come to ask for your daughter Dilan's hand in marriage to Mirkan. That's the reason for our visit. Now speak up. What can I say, Molla Rýza? I'm astonished. The parents always teach their little ones to fly. Why? So that they can fly from the nest when the time comes. Dilan is our firstborn. We've raised her till now. So her time to fly has come. There's nothing I can do about it. She must fly. She'll settle on another tree branch. Dilan may settle on the branch of a rose, or of a thornbush. Your daughter will settle on the branch of a rose, I'm telling you. Mirkan is poor, and we are poor. That's what worries me. Apart from that, I know Mirkan, and like him well. You're saying that Mirkan is honourable, but that he'd let her starve, because of his honour? Would a brave ever let his honour get besmirched? I wonder what my daughter thinks about it. What if we asked her? Wife! Listen, wife. Our guests have come with an auspicious offer. They want Dilan for Mirkan as a wife. Go to her and aks her what she thinks. You've heard, daughter. Molla Rizagil wants you for Mirkan. That's the way it is, daughter. You father expects your answer. Didn't you hear what I said? Your father expects your answer. - Speak up! - What can I say, mother? Mirkan is a good man ... I don't know... Let father decide what's best. She said, let father decide what's best. I see. Since I am to decide what's best, she shall be yours. I won't refuse guests like you. May she be sacrificed. May God grant auspiciousness. May God grant auspiciousness. May God grant auspiciousness. May God grant auspiciousness. You didn't reject us, may God bless you. Many thanks to you. May God grant you prosperousness. Many thanks, Halil Amca. We've settled the basics of the affair, now let's proceed to the details. - What do you ask for your daughter? - For my daughter Dilan I demand 30 sheep. But that's a lot, Halil Dayý. For your sake I'll deduct three sheep. That makes 27. Let's round the figure. Let's drink a cup of sherbet to 25, for the love of the Creator. Wife, if there's sugar in the house, make some sherbet. It's burning now. Why isn't your sister Dilan sitting with you by the cow dung fire? She can't go outside. Is she ill? She's engaged to be married. Engaged? To Mirkan. Last night the betrothal was arranged. And soon we will all be rich. Mirkan dayý will give us 25 sheep. What's the matter with you? Why do you look so gloomy, my beautiful son? - Did you talk to father? - So you've been hit that hard, my darling Paþo. Since you grieve so much, I'll talk to him. Don't. They gave Dilan to the orphan Mirkan. - Last night they were betrothed. - To the orphan Mirkan? As if Mirkan were a Bey of the Hassenan clan! That shitty-arsed orphan! They were betrothed? So what! That can easily be undone. I could have the orphan Mirkan's and the shepherd Halil's homes destroyed right now, and in their places grow some barley. You're the son of Zübeyt Bey. And that girl? A fairy princess from beyond Mount Kaf? Don't grieve. Leave the business to me. In fact, you leave the business to me from now on. From now on it's my business to win back a girl who is promised to another. I am Paþo Bey. There's no one on earth who can advise me, listen to my sorrow. On this earth, I have neither a mother who can advise me, nor a father. Forget what I told you. Until I tell you to go to them to ask for Dilan's hand, be patient and wait. But know this: one doesn't throw meat before a wolf. I'd lower myself like the dog crouching at Zübeyt Bey's doorstep, if I could only obtain that horse. The day will come when I too shall call a horse mine. Then I'll teach that horse everything I know. It'll become a flawless horse. Like Köroðlu's wild horse. And then I'll ride him into the hills. I'll send my riders after Zübeyt Bey. I won't buckle under him. I shall have 100 riders. We'll hide quietly in the hills. I'll tear down all the Beys' houses and finish off their cruel rule. You don't believe me? So what! You'll see the day. I'll lay waste the Beys' estates, and I'll return to the hills. The hills shall be my home. I'll be the most glorious of all the brigands. My star will shine as long as the earth turns round. Everybody shall know my star. Even the children shall know it. They'll show it to each other. "Oh, that's the brigand Kerim's star", they'll say. You can misbelieve as much as you like, you dumb beasts. Kerim. I'm going over to the Beyler plains now. You follow me quietly a bit later. I've called you out today to test you. I know you well. To this day I've never seen you act wrongly. Nor heard of it. I've made a mistake, brother Kero. Now you'll ask yourself if a Bey could ever make a mistake. He can. And that's what's burning me up. I can't tell my trouble to anybody. To whom could a Bey tell his trouble anyway? Then I thought deeply ... and decided to share my trouble with you. You don't ask about my mistake? I know. The trouble that's burning me up will burn you up too. Brother Kero ... let me ask you this: Have you ever been in love? No, my Bey, but I've heard about it. Siyabend's love for Hace. And the fairytale about Kerem's love for Aslý. But mine isn't a fairytale. - It's real, brother Kero. - For Heaven's sake! A Bey who's fallen in love? Perish the thought! So you understand my trouble now? My trouble isn't like those fairytales. It's such a love I'm ashamed to admit it even to myself. And now I'm going to tell you about my trouble. And nobody else shall know about it, except you and me and Mount Ararat. This world is out of joint, brother Kero. Out of joint. How could this happen? Outside of fairytales, who ever heard of a Bey who fell in love with a shepherd's daughter? Golly, it's unheard of, my Bey. But it's happened to me, brother Kero. Tell me, can you imagine a greater trouble, a greater sorrow? I can't, my Bey. Tell me, my Bey. I'll do everything for you that's in my power. You can command over my heart and soul. - Without realizing I fell in love with Dilan. - But Paþo Bey! I know. You'll say that Dilan has been promised to Mirkan. Don't say it. That's what's burning me up. But I swear that dog hasn't even touched Dilan yet. That'll be easy, my Bey. I'll just go to Mirkan now and tell him to give up Dilan. Ok? Out of the question! That wouldn't befit me. I am a Bey's son. I won't beg a poor orphan who's found shelter in my village. Even the stones in the hills would laugh at me. And my dignity would suffer. You must find such a way that my dignity would neither gain nor suffer. Listen to me, brother Kero. I'll tell you what I think. Let's see what you'll answer. I think that dog Mirkan has made a big mistake. Without consulting us he sent his men to ask for her hand. In our clan such an affair cannot be handled in secret. And when it's handled in secret we'll have to account for it. I think that dog Mirkan has made a big mistake. Am I wrong? You're right, my Bey. As right as Heaven and Earth. The devil is tempting me to take a gun and shoot the son of a dog. - Perish the thought! - So I shoot him. And then what? The result will be shitty. I'll spend years in jail. For what? For an orphan whose blood isn't worth twopence. That doesn't suit me, brother Kero. - That doesn't suit me. - It doesn't suit you, my Bey. If you were to kill someone, it'll have to be at least the son of Selim Bey. It wouldn't suit you to kill someone lower than that. So it's you, Kerim. Yes, it's me, Mirkan. I've cut some reeds down at the brook. When I saw you I came out. - Do have some tobacco? - No. - Going to the village? - Yes. Fine. I'll come with you. I've had enough for today. Am I the only one to toil for the Bey's estate. Let them send somebody else tomorrow. Have pity on me, Mirkan? What's the hurry? There's nobody waiting for you at home. I'm exhausted. Let's have a break. Sit down with me, for the love of God. I'm getting old. They say, one day working for a Bey is like ten days in jail. It's true. My life is melting away. What's the matter with you, little Mirkan? A while ago I was looking at you and was surprised. Your hands are busy with one thing, and your thoughts are far beyond the hills. As if you no longer cared for this world. You used to bring merriment wherever you went. Besides, you've taken the most beautiful girl in the village. What's the matter? For Dilan's hand I'll have to pay a huge dower. How can I pay? I curse my poverty. With each day the wall between Dilan and myself is rising. # ??? song lyrics Listen, I've thought of something, brother Mirkan. - How many sheep do you have? - Ten. Very well. Listen: you sell your ten sheep right now. Put the money in your pocket and come to me. We'll start for the Iranian border. You know I have many contacts over there. What if we went to Isfahan? I'll find a man to accompany you. You'll buy a carpet there and come back here. And you could sell that carpet to any Bey you like. You'll pay your dower and have your wedding feast. How about it? I'm confused, Kerim. Would such a thing really be possible? It's no big deal. Nothing's impossible in this world. The trip to Iran is as easy as a walk to the village well. You sell your sheep now. And you leave the rest to me. Ok? For Dilan, I'd give not only all my belongings, but also my life. What did you say? Nothing. Only one thing, Kerim. For Dilan I'd to anything, I'd even die for her. For her, I'd give up my sheep, even my beloved four foals. I'd even sell them. What's the matter, Kerim? Nothing's the matter with me, Mirkan. I haven't had a bite to eat since morning. I feel sick in my stomach. It'll pass. I must sell the sheep. And if this isn't enough, even the foals. I'll sacrifice everything for Dilan. Why sell your horse, little Mirkan? That's not necessary. 10 sheep are more than enough. If you sell it, how will you ride to the border? And for what did you raise the foal? Forget about it. Dilan. Dilan. It's me, Mirkan. Dilan. It's Mirkan, come to the door. Is everything all right, Mirkan? It is, Dilan. If you want to tell me something, be brief. People may be watching. Dilan. How can I tell you? Tell me, Mirkan. Don't feel shy. Whom else beside me do you have in this world? Don't feel shy. Know that I belong to you, heart and soul. I was promised to you after they drank the sherbet. I was sacrificed to you. Look here, Dilan. Listen to me. Before sunrise I'll have to leave for Iran. I'll buy an Isfahan carpet with the money I got for my sheep. Then I'll come back and pay your dower. And maybe I'll even offer you a wedding feast worthy of you. I've thought about it for a long time. And I found no other way except smuggling from Iran. Kerim has been very helpful. A bit later we'll both leave for the road. This is the way of the word, my Dilan. One can never be sure. Sometimes it blows you about, sometimes it hurls you, sometimes it roasts you, you never know. Maybe I'll never come back. I mustn't leave behind any regrets. I wanted to see you before I leave. Dilan, my daughter. Don't look at me like this. Don't burn up this old heart. I feel ashamed, both before you and Mirkan. Tonight he left for strange lands, pursuing worldly riches. All the village knows that Mirkan is risking his life for the dower money. I couldn't have known, daughter. I didn't see it coming. Otherwise, I'd never have consented. To hell with the dowry. But I'm not to blame, my beautiful daughter. Really I'm not. In our custom an orphan girl is married without a dower. If you too had been an orphan, the problem wouldn't have come up. Mirkan left with Kerim. A Bey's dog doesn't eat a poor man's food. Why did that dog accompany him? I'm at a loss. I've asked for the dower for your sake, daughter. I didn't want you to come to a strange home, embarrassed, your face darkened with shame. I wanted you to come to them with a bright face, magnificently. Also ... after you were gone, I was hoping for a good hot meal. How could I know it would come to this? If I had known, I'd have held Mirkan back, told him: "Come with me, my son, take your wife and leave with her." I couldn't have known, daughter. Father. In this affair you're not to blame. It just happened. What is written on the fate of a brave, that'll happen to him, father. Everything will be all right. You've suffered all your life, father, you mustn't fret because of my troubles. You've finally made me cry too. And I didn't even cry when my father died. Don't, my doe, light of my eyes, don't put us all to shame. I'll keep watch. You stay home. The moment I see a man approaching, I'll call you. Come on, go back inside. Come on, daughter. Come on, daughter. Have a bite to eat. Put back some lights in your eyes. We've already been put to shame before everybody, don't waste away yourself. He'll either die or come back. Are there no other braves around? If not Mirkan, then you'll take another. So this is how your womanly feelings are, mother. If father hadn't been there, you'd have taken another, and if not that one, again another. I thought you were my mother. Mirkan's hand has touched mine. I've been promised. I have promised! I have promised, I'll never look at another man, I'll never take another lover. He is risking his life for me. I'd sacrifice myself a thousand times for a brave who is risking his life for his girl. So you really love him, daughter. I didn't know. Forgive me. I wouldn't have thought you'd fall so much in love with Mirkan. Come out, daughter. There's a man coming from the fields. What's the matter, Dilan? Why so exited? I saw a sheep with a broken leg in the hills. Was it yours? What's the matter with you, girl? Tell me the truth, Kerim dayý. What happened to Mirkan? Why didn't he come back with you? Good God! Nothing'll happen to Mirkan. I'm a man who keeps his word. He crossed over the border in safety. I've even found a man to accompany him. He'll be back within three or four days. He'll be back. And your behaviour is scandalous, girl. If someone saw you they'd think you were asking about your husband. Get back home now. Is it so hard to wait three or four days? Be patient, little one. I saw you come back. The girl who accosted you, wasn't she that infidel's daughter? Yes, my Bey. - What did she say? - Whatever she had to say. She asked about Mirkan. What did you reply? What could I do? I told her what happened. Is this the truth? Yes, my Bey. She didn't get suspicious? I don't know. When is that dog coming back? Within three or four days. How can we learn about it? The man I placed at his side will inform us. What if Mirkan leaves him and comes back alone? That would be hard. Once he lies down to sleep he'll sleep through the night. It's not a walk-over, to make a trip to Iran. So will he be returning by the same path he left? Is there any other path, my Bey? What if he returned by another path? Impossible. Our men are like sheep. They always take the path they're shown. Very well. Nobody must know about it. Mirkan's horse and home shall be yours even before I'll possess Dilan. Thank you, my Bey. For your help. Rovia dayý ??? [cries out in desperation at a strange rider] Rovia dayý Rovia dayý You've done a bad thing, Kerim. I've prepared the plot for you how to kill. As a Bey. And you were promised a horse. And now my dream of a life in the hills, turned to shit. The hundred riders at my side, turned to shit. Laying waste Zübeyt Bey's estates, turned to shit. A brigand who builds his life on blood is bound to sink. You've done a bad thing, Kerim. Did Mirkan ever harm you? To please Paþo Bey, you interfered between two lovers. Would you also go into the hills just to please a Bey? It would turn to shit. You'd be put to shame. May your dumb brain be cursed. And what's the fault of the little sparrow? What's poor Dilan's fault? That she called you "uncle"? You're a dishonourable blackguard. Who are Dilan and Mirkan to me? I feel sorry for them. But who feels sorry for me? I've spent my life at a Bey's doorstep. My hand has never touched a woman's breast. I've never had a good night's sleep. Who will feel sorry for me? Everybody is only interested in their own affairs. Dilan in Mirkan, Paþo Bey in his cock. And I'm sitting here, feeling sorry about the affairs of strangers. I'm alone with my troubles. If I can realize my dreams one day, I'll revenge the wrong done to Dilan and Mirkan. I'll lay waste Zübeyt Bey's estates. Everybody will praise me when he dies. And my fame will be eternal. That's all there is to it. That dog Kerim has settled in Mirkan's home. Shall I teach you what real thirst means? You've been wearing me out for days now. Hasn't the orphan Mirkan taught you how to drink water? Why don't you drink the water, cool and fresh? I know your throat must be parched, so why don't you drink? Or do you suspect something? So what, don't drink! As if I care. I'd ride you to the brook tomorrow morning. I could, but the way things are I probably won't. Your hind legs look weird. The villagers might laugh at me. I'd want us both to appear flawless in the village. Everybody shall know that I'm a better groom of horses than even Köroðlu's father. Impossible. I must keep your hind legs stretched over night. Leave me alone. Are you my curse? Take away everything that's yours. But this house and this horse now belong to me! Get it? If you can't take it, come out and let's deal with it. They told me that you're grieving, I didn't believe them. Leave the dead alone. Nothing will come of your grieving. What's my fault in this affair? If Mirkan had asked me for the money, I swear I'd have given it to him. Because I love you. If you're interested in me, send your suitors over. But stop following me around. Thank you, daughter. Long may you live. They said that Molla Rýza will come to us tonight with an auspicious business. What could it be? I didn't ask. Let's hope it's auspicious. How can I know if you don't. What's the matter, Dilan? Nothing's the matter, but you asked mother something. Come here, daughter, you probably know about it. Father, it's not fitting for me to say so, but they'll be sending suitors over to ask for my hand. They want me for Züybeyt Bey's son, Paþo Bey. What! Have they gone raving mad? Our dead's blood hasn't even dried yet. Shame on them! What times we're living in, by God. Out of the question! Not only for Zübeyt Bey's son, even for the Padishah's son, I'd refuse. Accept them, father. And they're not raving mad. Ever since Mirkan died, Paþo Bey has been pursuing me. He was even interested in me before Mirkan came along. And now I'm interested in Paþo Bey too. And if you don't accept them, I'll run away. But I want you to have a good hot meal in your old age, that my siblings have some decent clothes to wear. Don't let me run away. They're coming to you with a marriage contract. They could have torn our house down and abducted me, if they'd wanted to. And you'd be left in misery. That's all there is to it. I'm behaving shamelessly. Forgive me, father. I have no other way out. I only ask one thing of you: demand a high dower. If you can't ... have pity on me, have pity on my mother, my siblings. I wish you'd never been born. I wish your mother had given birth to a stone instead. So our honour has turned to a woolen cap in your hands, that anybody can put on. Father, I haven't turned your honour into a woolen cap, and I won't. - All the women are like her, without faith or honour. - That's right. If my mother had handled this affair, I'd have understood. But how could Dilan do it? The blood of the brave Mirkan not dried yet, how could she climb into the dog Paþo's bed? Knowing perfectly well that within a year, all she'll be good for is milking the ewes. There's something fishy in the Mirkan business. I can't understand it. You're right. I can't understand it either. I wonder who's responsible for what happened to Mirkan? Kerim? He couldn't even cut a chicken's throat. Paþo Bey? Now wait a bit... Wait a bit, but ... after Mirkan set out for his smuggling business, Paþo Bey never left the village. Whom could he have sent instead? You see, it's complicated. But even if we knew, Civan, after all, he's a Bey. And who are we? Powerless. It's happened to Mirkan. He was a good friend. May God protect him, wherever he is now. Take your dower price. And prepare your daughter, we'll fetch her tomorrow. Call for her now, let me have a look at her. She's beautiful. Come on, my sweetheart. Come on, sonny. Don't worry, brother Mirkan. You wait and see how I'll move into the hills. How I'll return with a hundred riders. How I'll lay waste Zübeyt Bey's estates, grow barley in their place. You'll see. Allah and His Prophet Muhammed be praised! Turkish subtitles: ismuta and ÝBRAHÝM YILMAZ
