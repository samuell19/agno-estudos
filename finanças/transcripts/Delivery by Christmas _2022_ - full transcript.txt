ICE-CREAM DELIVERY BY CHRISTMAS What's up, Maksiu? Everything's okay? I wanna pee. Urgently? Okay, let's go. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! GRANDPA - Hello, Krzysiu. - I was at your place, Grandpa. Congratulations. What did you want? You know. Grandma promised me that ring. In that case, talk to her. I would, if she were alive. - Krzysztof, the investors. - One moment, okay? Hello? He... Wetness all around. Reach out. Be happy. Can you manage by yourself? Just wait for me here, okay? OUT OF ORDER CLOSEST WC - 13TH FLOOR And you're here for what purpose? Then fire away. - Hi. - I'm here. - Yes. Uh, this is everything. - I see. Just the code. - Maks? - No. - Maksiu? - No. - Looking for me? - No, no! Thank you! Uh, Merry Christmas! I'll drop by, and this time don't pretend you're not there. I heard scuffling. Stop calling me, you're blocking the line. If I were dying, I wouldn't be able to call an ambulance. If you start dying, Grandpa, just leave the ring in a visible place. Okay, come over, maybe I'll leave it. Weren't you supposed to wait for your mom? Maks! Maksiu? You should mind your kid, not leave him alone to deal with a urinal. Um, well, thank you for taking care of Maks. Let's go. He said the "F" word. Can I say it? No, no, no. Better not. Merry Christmas, yeah? Come on. Let's go. Oh no. - Um... what's wrong? - Your son shredded my papers. I won't leave here until night. You know... I'm really sorry. Do you pick up things professionally? - Yes? - Hello. I have a pick-up. For Krzysztof. A guy... in a suit. Said you've got something for him. Give him my holiday regards. He said it was something really important. If it's important, then why... didn't he come himself? Some trouble at work. I don't know. I really don't want to interfere, but he said it's a matter... of life and death. Excuse me. I do actually have something for him. Come in! Oh, that's Wilhelm. A member of the family. He spent more time with my wife than I did, so I immortalized him. Mom, a frigate! A clipper! The fastest sailing ships! Yeah, I sailed around the whole world on that one. - Can you help me wrap the gift up? - Sure. And... this is for Krzysztof, right? Yeah. He likes this kind of stuff. - When will he get it? - Delivery by Christmas. Company policy. Maks! Thank you. Goodbye! Ahoy! - What's that? - Oh, a trifle. I'll deliver it on the way. Sweet of the Chimney. Thanks. Kama... Maks' gift was supposed to arrive. The guys were to redirect the package, but it's not here. Not everyone's back yet. It'll be here. Hiya! Hiya, kid! - One, two, three... One... - The speech. Uh, welcome, all employees. So, yes. Christmas Eve is, uh... This is, um, could be the time to sum things up. I've been with you for a few weeks now. Thank you very much... for bestowing your trust upon me. An... and trust, as we know, is a key... core... I work on my core every day. As statistics show... Christmas Eve is the time of miracles! And that's why I wanted to wish you all the best. I would also like to say, uh... that... Now, imagine a lion. - Yes, you are the lion. - Yes, I am. You're a charismatic predator, a determined mammal who always gets what he wants. Nobody knows how to use that PA system, so don't worry. Come to the party. The director has no time to party. He leads the pride. The pride is, uh... is there right now. The team doesn't like me. Beginnings are always hard. And... you don't have to be a lion the whole time. Besides... uh, I'm sure there's someone who likes you. Back there... or somewhere else. Are you crazy? W-What, what was that? Well, you came to me. Because... I felt sorry for you. ...who always gets what he wants. Sometimes, a lion may be blinded by his success. But not you. Because you have the heart of a lion. We'll see... who's sorry tomorrow. - Hi, butterfly. - Beautiful night. You're so hot too? Can I drop off Maks at you tomorrow? For two or three hours. Grażka? Wet hair? Without panties in the frost? Cover up. Help me. Marysiu, you're ok? Very good. Better than ever. Finish this cigarette and come inside. - Grażka. - Bye. Good night. 24TH DECEMBER Uh, hello. I've got a package for Mirek. That's my son. I can take it. Merry Christmas! All the best. Hello. Delivery. A package for me? - Yes. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Hello. - Oh, hello. Wonderful. Thank you so much. Were there any problems? None. - Oh, hello. - Hello. Um, in that case, uh... - No. There's no need. Merry Christmas! - No, really, 'cause... Please wait... Oh, I don't have anything after all. No worries. Goodbye. - Hello? - Grandpa, what did you send me? You didn't get the ring? Wait, my cabbage stew is burning. Auntie Gienia poured the flour. Maybe you could start decorating the Christmas tree, eh? 'Cause Graża said that the dough was sticky and it's gonna stick. And the worst thing that can happen is when you stick to something you shouldn't. And you're stuck. Maks, wash off that dough, okay? Mom, the gift! Your gift! - Have you written a letter to Santa? - I haven't. I'll write it for you. What would you like to get? I've already got everything. I've got you. And a job. Mom, you should want something. I want... Oh! The Christmas Eve map. No, come on. What comes first? - Well? - Decorating the tree? Exactly. Zbyszek. Move over. Zbyszek, Zbyszek... Mom! - Hello? - Maks, is that you? We peed together yesterday, remember? Can you put your Mom on the phone? She's busy now. Listen... And where's your Mom? - Here. - Which means where? Merry Christmas to you. - You're here for me? - Yes. It's the wrong package. Whatever's in here isn't for me. We don't always get what we want. You don't understand how serious this is. Oh... Excuse me, how did you even find me, huh? You have a very intelligent child. I'm sorry, could you put on your uniform? There's work to do. You do know it's Christmas Eve? It's my day off. And... you won't do anything about this? It's Christmas! Hi, Kama! Hi, darling. - This is a total mess. - Okay? Some client got the wrong package. Your deliveries from today are screwed up. But what do you mean? The packages went to the wrong places. I don't know, something wrong with labels. Yours too, with the present for... Kama, Kama, you're on a speaker right now, you know? Your most important package. Oh, fuck! - Mom, come on! - How did this happen? Christmas is a time of miracles. So, where could Maks' present be? At one of these addresses? Good thing you only had four deliveries. But take it easy, do it after Christmas. I'll deal with it. Take care. Marysia? What are you up to? Next item on the list. Maksiu... CHRISTMAS EVE MAP MAKING GINGERBREAD - Finally. - Excuse me? - Excuses accepted. We can go. - "We"? Please deliver this to the right person and retrieve my package. Why have you crossed me out? This is your address. This is my address. I've already got those two packages. I've got three addresses left. But I need my package as soon as possible. I figured. Someone tampered with it. Okay. I can manage on my own. I doubt that. - Please leave. - You can go, friend. So, we're friends now? Krzysztof. Shouldn't a courier's route be closer to home? This isn't my route. I'm substituting. Gas. - Diesel. - But it's running out, yeah? That? That's the indicator. It's broken. So, how do you know... how much fuel is left? Uh, today is Friday... I got a refill on Wednesday... No, uh, no. On Monday. - I think, we shouldn't run out. - We shouldn't run out? How can you be sure? It's like soft-boiling eggs, yeah? You just know when to take them out. No. That's not how you soft-boil eggs. Fine. I trust my intuition, okay? Your intuition. 'Cause of your intuition, we'll be... stuck in a field or I'll have to run with a bucket to get some gas. - Diesel. - Country dogs will bark at us. - So? Are you afraid of dogs? - That's not the point! One must have a plan. One must be prepared, think things through. I've got a plan. I'm prepared for anything. I can see that. Did you turn on some kind of seat heating or what? Oh, uh, you're sitting on my dryer. This is your plan? Y... you've got a bathroom in... in your car. That's how I spice up my life, y'know? So I don't become a bore. I got the hint. Where are we going? A FEW HOURS EARLIER Michał! Could you get that? - Uh, hello. I've got a package for Mirek. - That's my son. I can take it. Merry Christmas! All the best. From some Milena. Maybe it's a gift? Definitely a gift. I'll open it and put it under the tree! He's a grown boy... and you're inspecting his stuff? Honey? Am I seeing things? No, your eyes are fine, Mario la. There you go. A gas station. But you'd rather risk it, huh? I'll do it for you. Here you go. GAS STATION Fill it up. - Fill what up? - You wanted to fuel up, so go ahead. - Merry Christmas! - Yeah, yeah. I can help. No, hold it. I'll pull. - The hose is too short. - We can manage. If you could pass it under the car, - I'll grab it on the other side. - Under where? It's Christmas. It pays to be nice to people. Can you move the car? Move the car. - What a nuisance. - What? Who's a nuisance? She can't park properly and I'm supposed to... drag the hose under the car? Here. You fill it up. Do it yourself. - Hello. - Hello. Our uncle got a hold of this reindeer and it's for my nephew, Jaś. He's four. How do we erase this? Auntie Krysia is an old cow! Kiss my hairy ass! All right. Uh, no point in struggling with this. - This one should be fine. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Merry Christmas! - Thanks. - Come again. - Thanks. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hi, Dad. What are you doing here? We've been calling you, but you're not picking up. Well, I'm at work. Has anything happened or...? No. Who's Milena? A friend from work. Why? Well... You got a package... From that... that girl, Milena. HI DADDY! - Dad, this is some kind of joke. - M-m-mirek... This looks like a serious matter to me. But Dad, this is impossible. Take it. Take one, 'cause your sugar level will be dropping now. - Take it. - I, I, I'll ask. - Wa... wait here, I'll ask. - But Mirek, there's nothing to ask about! Oh, it's you. - You're smoking? - Yeah. Why are you so spooked? - I got... - Fucking Christmas! I tried moving a unicorn on a shelf and some kid bit me. I got that surprise gift from you. - Ohhhhhh... - Can I have one? And? Did you like it? I was kind of at a loss for words. Was it that Halloween party? What if the kid was rabid? I'm off in a moment, but maybe... you wanna talk about it? Drop by my house. It's kind of necessary now. Fuck, I hate kids. You'll heal in no time! THE COUNTER SHOULD SHOW ZERO - All right, I'll go pay. How much? - You wanted to fill it up... Sixty liters. Diesel. You were supposed to fill it with diesel. - Merry Christmas! To you, miss. - Goodbye. Not much of a reserve. You'll have to start cleaning on your own. Your pants are crumpled. The Grandparents are waiting. What a beautiful tree. Did you decorate it yourself, Mirek? With Mom, like every year, Grandma. So, my darlings? I think it's time... to exchange wishes. When will she be here? Who? Mirek's lady friend. What friend? From work, Grandma. She got the address, but I don't know if she comes. Then tell us about her. Come on! Well, we... don't know each other very well. - We've... only spoken a few times. - Yes? I don't really know how this even happened. You've got a kid and you don't know how it happened? He made a baby?! Mirek has a baby? - What will it be? - No, uh... I mean, I don't remember everything. Maybe I can still get out of this somehow. Excuse me? What do you mean "get out of this"? Excuse me. Well... Mirek, go. But what am I to tell her? Tell her... Well? What do you usually say? You just babbled like a loon. Jesus Christ... But from the heart. Tell her... it will be all right. That you'll always be at her side and that you'll think of everything. After all, you work in a toy store, so you'll bring the kid... - stuffed toys. - Yeah. And since you still live with us, we'll help out too. Hello, sir. I'm very sorry, but I delivered a package here this morning. But there was a problem at the sorting office and there was a mistake. This is your package. You do have that package from this morning, right? - That one wasn't for me? - No, no. I apologize. Just a second, okay? Yes... Oh, great. Thank you very much. - No, thank you. Uh... - All the best. Goodbye. Merry Christmas. Goodbye. There is no baby. So, where is it? The courier made a mistake. You were worried for nothing. There won't be a baby? Can you pass the herring? But... this isn't it. Seat belt. A FEW HOURS EARLIER Hello. Delivery. A package for me? - Goodbye! - Goodbye. From Estera? The giraffe loves the juicy pulp of acacia and commiphora leaves. While looking for a source of food the giraffe may cross many kilometers. It often follows the smell of distant rain. Trees are its salvation, even if the female has to extend its neck to reach the leaves. I knew the most beautiful giraffes were in Botswana. One would think that when a giraffe raises its head the blood quickly drains from the brain causing a loss of consciousness. However, it is not so. Estera, honey, you'll get cold. Cover yourself. Specialized blood vessel shunts prevent the blood from rapid draining. They owe their survival to a life strategy developed over millions of years. How graceful. Listen, you're not... the only one whose package is missing. Mine is too. A gift for Maks. A hand-painted sailing ship model. Very hard to get. I'm sorry for the kid. Yeah, it cost me half my pay. A kid should be loved, not bought with expensive gifts. Thanks, you've broadened my horizons. - You're compensating for something. - What do you care? You don't have to say if you don't want to. I already know. Know what? Well, I know... girls like you. Independent. Lonely, with emotional baggage. Yeah? You got any other advice for me? You should try harder? - I lost my tailpipe. - What? My exhaust pipe is wobbling. Can you check it? - Me? - In the back. God, what a clunker. Moron. New dress? Do you like it? It's alright. That's all? The tailor said that... it was perfect. - But I'm not sure. - You said he's a good tailor. You even wanted to buy him a gift or something. I have. He makes such beautiful things for others, but he himself is kind of... transparent. Need help? Your hair. Thank you. Are we leaving already? It's still early. A seam ripped. Maybe the tailor's still open. Is it still wobbling? You abandoned me here. I spaced out. Are you getting in? Your phone beeped or something. Just don't get muck on the upholstery. Okay. Maybe let's go, 'cause... - It's 4 p.m. - Maks. Uh, Maks comes first. - What? - I have to pick him up from the aunties. From w-where? Our neighbors are taking care of my son. They're going out for Christmas Eve. What don't you understand? Okay. Mrs. Estera. I got your gift. It was surprising. We've known each other for so many years, so... maybe it's high time we... stopped being so official. Right. A seam gave out. I understood the message. You're a beautiful woman, Estera and... if you're ready... then so am I. I'm just here about the ripped seam. - Give me a minute. - Okay. - Honey... - Krzysiek, you were supposed to be home. - Well... - Well? I, I, I know, Zuza, but let's not do this over the phone, okay? Where exactly are you? - Yeah. Where am I? - Where? - I'm lost. - Lost. I mean with my work. - Everything's ready. You promised me. - Yeah. The parents are already here. You know this is important to me. When will you be back? In-in-in half an hour. Thank you very much. Have fun. A visit with the family. Been waiting for this all year. The cheesecake won't eat itself. Come on. Bye. Mom... - Yes, honey? - I need to poop. Fuck it. Okay. It's an important day. And my first time on patrol. Yeah. The city's empty, there's no one in the shops and thieves are having a field day. But there are no shops here. There's nothing here. POLICE Should I wipe the windshield? I will, eh? Its' a cool task. We used to have squad cars... that didn't even have ventilation. Models from '95, '96... '98... That's the year I was born. Hard to stay focused on a day like this, huh? Look! Officer Bogdan Kolenda, road check. - Papers, please. - Sure. Excuse me, could we get this done rather quickly? I can pay the ticket. - Who is the vehicle's owner? - I am. - Maria Kwiecień? - No. I mean yes! Jan Maria Kwiecień. That's my name. But it was too long to fit in the registration papers. Okay, so... How much? - He's trying to make an illegal payment... - N-no, n-n-not illegal... Sir, this vehicle's technical inspection is overdue. Of course it is. 'Cause formally... this isn't my car. - Oh! - Then whose is it? My friend's. I mean a distant friend... actually, really, she's a complete stranger to me, yeah? How much? Sir, this car will be impounded. Please wait here while we contact the HQ. "How much?" POLICE Hello? Hello? - I think it's broken. - You gotta press the button. Here 314, come in, 200. The car's definitely stolen. We have to arrest him. - He's playing hard to get! - Jesus. - I think I see him. - Yeah, yeah. - I can't see him. - Go right! - Or maybe left? - No, no, right, right. - Here? - What? - Here. - That? That's a trash container. Really? You blocked someone, so I had to move the car. He kept honking his horn. - What is this? - What? It was like that this morning. - It was loose. - Maksiu, get in, okay? It's warm inside. You wrecked my car! Okay, Marysia, I'll call a cab. There's no time. You're not getting into this car again. Goodbye. Oh, come on! Leave it! This is the worst day of my life. I take the subway to work. I, I, I can't park! And I was rude and... We started off on the wrong foot, Marysia. I'm sorry. Is he coming with us? I don't really know. I wanted to... propose today, but nothing is going as it should. Well, I have to agree with that. Before she died, Grandma promised me that if I wanted to get married, Grandpa would give it to me for luck and... I really need that luck. Get in. Don't make me regret this. Mom, will there be a gift when we get back? Yes, honey. Because I'm kinda hungry. Could I have the "emergency" gummies? Sorry, Maks, but... I ate them. I have a candy bar. I don't like raisins. Then I'll... Cool, I'll eat the raisins. - Okay? - Mhm. - Stop! - What? - Stop the car! Turn off the lights. - What? Kill the engine. - What? What's going on? - Marysia, there's a squad car there. So what? Do you know your technical inspection is overdue? How do you know that? I checked, uh, your glove compartment out of boredom. Maks, get down. I'm really sorry, son. I'll get a chance to... revise our plans, okay? Mom, this is better than normal Christmas! POLICE They are leaving. You're sticking out. Lay down. - What? - Lay down. What are you doing there? They've gone already. Today in Bethlehem There is good news There is good news Michał? What are you doing there? The carburetor? 'Cause sometimes I think... that you come here to hide from me. No. I was actually happy that there's going to be a baby. But maybe it's better this way. The boy has to mature. It will happen by itself. The only thing that happens by itself is rusting. - It's for your own good, Mirek. - I know you'll manage. But today? There's never a good time. Maksiu... just this and one more place and we're done, okay? - Should I go with you? - If you want to. Okay. Well... it's Christmas Eve. Hold up. This is where your or mine parcel is. There's a light on! Um, give me a leg up. - How? - Normally, just crouch down. Okay. Let's do this. - Just stop wiggling around. - Then get up. Get up now. - This isn't actually funny! - Turn around! But I'm ticklish... wrong way! Where are you ticklish? - On... on my thighs! - What? - Who has ticklish thighs? - Well, I do! I am! - Oh, hello. - Merry Christmas. This is the proper package. And... this package opened the heart of a wonderful woman to me. Have you been... together long? Us? No. - No... - No, it's a misunderstanding. Sometimes misunderstandings are the start of wonderful things. I should go. Just a bit more... and Zuza will be all yours. - Wasn't this supposed to be a ship? - It will be once I find it. - And what is this? - Mm... your lucky charm. - What charm? - For luck. This was supposed to be Grandma's ring for Zuza. So, we've... we've misunderstood each other... But what... what's there to misunderstand? I don't know. Maybe Grandpa thought that... this would do you more good. - Sorry, it's a dumb joke, I know... - No, no, no. This has to be a mistake. There have to be other packages somewhere that were... I don't know, misplaced. I was with Grandpa when he wrapped this. And you couldn't tell me that all this time I've been chasing a prick? How was I to know you were expecting a ring? Have you ever seen someone propose with a cock? I'm sorry. It seemed really plausible to me... No... This Christmas was supposed to be special. And it is. - Santa, Santa! - Hello? See? It's not Santa. Just some chick and a dude. Maybe they're selling wafers. Uh, hi. Is there an adult in the house? Mom's flight was cancelled. Dad went somewhere on a repair. I'm the oldest. I'm from the courier company. There was a package on your doorstep this morning. Come in. I'll call Dad. Okay. What should I say? Nothing. You're in luck. The gift ended up... in the right hands. But this package is for you as well. It's from mommy! Oh, no. Dammit. Not now, baby. - Gas? - Diesel. Is there, uh, a station nearby? That way, but it's quite far from here. Okay... Hello? - Kama? - Hi. I'm sorry for bothering you tonight, darling, but there's a problem. Could you send me someone with a canister? - I... - Hello? I can't believe it. Oh. Then maybe I'll use my phone and call a taxi. No, it's... there's music playing. Fine, screw it. Meaning? I live there. I screwed up Maks' Christmas Eve. I'll at least get him to bed. Can you lock up the car? Just press the beeper, yeah? I'll carry Maks. Could you take this toy out of my pocket? Why? Does it hurt you? Okay. - Lay down him there. - His jacket. Later. And what about his gift? I don't know. I'll give him some knick-knack. I have some stashed away. I'll tell him the ship didn't get here, because... the reindeer got a hernia, and Santa got delayed. We don't always get what we want, huh? Wait a moment. You know what? 'Cause... you, you're... you're probably tired too and... and I... FOR FOREVER my feet have been wet for an hour, so... Give it to Zuza. No... Give it to your Zuza. No, no, I'm sorry. I can't take it. Well... It might not be from Grandma, but... it's quite nice. It's only catching dust here and I... don't see any prospects for it. You'll propose... and it'll be great. Your friends will visit you and say: "Wow... what a perfect couple". So sweet... it makes you sick. Go. You have something to do. Thank you. 25TH DECEMBER - Hi. - Hi, kid. May I? Is your mom in? No. Okay. SEVERAL HOURS EARLIER Who did you land yourself there? We saw him leave. You didn't brag about him. He's a cutie... Meh. His hair looked weird... No, it... That was nobody. So, you don't have any... plans for the rest of the evening? And we... also have cake. - Come over. Come! - Go. So, I tell him that it doesn't matter what it's called. I don't know myself. But since we... started living together, it's been the most beautiful time of my life. Here's to you! Are we expecting anyone? Kama? Come in! Come inside. - You're alive. - I am. - Yeah. - Kamila. What happened to your phone? - I was worried sick, girl! - Sorry! I completely forgot. A gift. - What's that? - Diesel. This year, I'm doing it. I checked. A plane to Malawi, then along the Zambezi... all the way to Botswana. - Oh! Botswana? - The wildest place on Earth. - That's my main New Year's resolution. - Good luck! Your husband keeps saying the same thing ever year and nothing! What about New Year's Eve? You got any plans? Sex all night long. What are we doing, Ester? I don't recall. Is it that tailor? I want to feel that I'm still alive, Eryk. So, what now? Our whole life down the drain. You always wanted to travel. But you didn't. Go. Go to those giraffes, antelopes, meerkats... - You think? - I love you and I want you to be happy. What about you? I'll order another dress. Oh, there you are! 'Cause I got off here and then went there. But you weren't there and... - My folks' place is there. - Okay. You invited me to your folks' place? Well, I live... I mean... I lived with my parents. Milena, what exactly did you send me, eh? So... you haven't seen it yet? Dude, you made a bet with me and I won. Now it's your turn to do a task. Marysia! Marysia! Hey. Hey. Hey. - What are you doing here? - I'm loo-looking for you. Shouldn't you be home? I don't have a home. I live with my parents. I don't have anyone. - Easy. Come on, let's sit. Over there. - Come on, come over there. Easy. I've lived with them... - for 38 years. - Right. Uh, let's sit and talk. That's just life. Come on. - Marysia... - Sit down. - Marysia... - Yeah? - I need to tell you something. - What? - Shoot. - I changed around those packages. Why did you do that? 'Cause I... 'Cause I'm a lion. What you and I had was... it was fire. - What are you saying? - When you left me... I know you think I could have tons of women like that. But I don't. I'm sorry. You know what it means to be... alone in the world. Uh, I met Santa in the parking lot. He asked about you and said that... the reindeer, uh, has... a hernia. Mom told you, right? She said he had a bad hoof. Yeah. Yeah. A bad hoof. So... he didn't have time to wrap this. Here. No "Merry Christmas"? I didn't propose. We split up. Well... good riddance to bad boats. Just... a bit of compassion? For once. Oh... As they say: The morning's rain and a girl's pain. Both don't last long. You had a pretty good childhood, right? What? What other kid had a monkey at home? Some had a monkey at home, others – a normal grandfather, huh? You know that... you can always stay here. That's still your room. Thanks. Where did all this come from? Krzysiek brought it. Yesterday, I lied to you and the captain. What's wrong, honey? I wanted a ship like this too, so I took the smallest one. I didn't know I'd get more today. - You snatched it, mm? - Yes. Come on. We'll escort Zbigniew home. You'll explain everything to me on the way and we'll return the ship, hm? - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. We're here on, uh, a special task, What a beautiful schooner! I'm sorry. I... snatched it. Oh, it's mine! Don't worry about it. I once stole too – a compass. But he shouldn't have done that, right? Maks is very sorry. Nonsense! A man has to get through life somehow. Here! As a gift from me, you sea dog. I've got tons of such junk. Come in, I'll show you. Tea? Only for a moment. You're probably busy with Christmas and... What are you talking about? My grandson is moving in with me to guide me in my old age. Krzysiek? But... since when? Well... he's moving out of his girlfriend's. He just went to get his stuff. Maybe a piece of this... cheese. You'll quickly get promoted. Yeah. That's my wish for you. For Christmas and... your whole life. - That's him! Bogdan, that's him! - Okay, let's go. - Slowly, but surely. - Mhm. Come on, switch on! I got the controller wet. - Hello? - Hello, hi. I'm calling, 'cause... Right! Thanks for standing in for the reindeer. No. I'm really sorry, Marysia, but there's a squad car after you. What is it with you and squad cars, huh? I haven't told you everything. You're in serious trouble. Why am I in trouble? I-I'll explain everything in a sec... - Dammit! - Hello? He-hello? Fuck it. POLICE Jan Maria Kwiecień. Mom! Officer Barbara Pasterz. Please step out of the vehicle. So, Jan Maria Kwiecień testifies that he did this for you... Maria Kwiecień! This lady i-i-is... is unfortunately right. And maybe I wanted to help in the beginning, - but... - Mom... Zbyszek is barely moving anymore. Why doesn't that fish have any water? It splashed out. We were just on our way to the river. Listen, he won't make it much longer. - Release the animal and return. - Ouch. And behave. You're being watched. Maks, you coming? No, I'm staying here. - What are you doing? - So he gets used to the temperature. It's a carp. He just adapts to new conditions. Yeah? Just like you. I've got something for you. I'll release him. It's not swimming away. It's turning around? Zbyszek, wetness all around. Reach out. Be happy. The new life awaits you. Go for it. Ouch. Damn. My fingers got... fat. You threw the ring away?! No. It slipped. Why did you do that? That was my emotional baggage. Yours too, kinda. We've got a carte blanche before us. Carp blanche. - It's unpacked yet. - Hi, Daddy! Look, we have a Christmas tree! It comes together... - Put Daddy on. - Daddy, it's Mom. Give me this. Aren't we too old for this? This is the most beautiful gift ever! I think we've gone crazy in our old age. See? There will be a wedding! Delicious! 'Cause I've got experience. Subtitle by: Hellen Wanjiku
