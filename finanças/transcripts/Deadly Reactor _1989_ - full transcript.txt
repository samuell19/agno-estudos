CODY: No one thought a nuclear holocaust could ever happen. But it did. And when it did, it left two kinds of people. The good kind and the bad. And then there was the bad. A gang of savage low lives with no morals or mercy. (SINGING) There's a big bad bear out in the woods. Chomp, chomp, chomp. CODY: They killed my niece and my nephew. [gunshots] They raped my sister. [woman screaming] And they left me for dead. [gasping] My god, he's alive. CODY: You know if it wasn't for the carrying hands of Duke I guess I wouldn't be alive today. DUKE: Break this fever, you going to be all right, kid. Yeah. I'll just watch you over here. DUKE: The leader of this gang was a creature called Hog. MAN: Hog. Hog. I found this hound. So what? With a gas station. Where? About 30 miles from here. And they got a cat there too. So I bet they got some food. [sneaky laughter] So tomorrow we check it out. All right. But right now, leave me alone. You got it boss. Hog man, you not going to leave me, are you? Would I leave you? Not tonight, darling. Broke the fever, boy. Ah. Somebody up there is looking out for ya. Where am I? This my cabin. I'm Duke. You'll be all right. I wonder who did this to you. [dog barking] Hello, mother. Oh, you're late, Shawna. Father's really upset. Hello, father. Hi, Joe. What can I get for you today? You look beautiful today, Shawna. Thank you. Go back in the kitchen and wash the dishes. Father, you said-- Just do as I tell you. Mr. Dawson, you a very lovely daughter. You stay away from my daughter. Jim, please. She's just a child, Marie. May I help you? Yeah. I'm hungry. What do you have to trade? How about your life for some food? No need for guns. [gunshot] Now look, I don't want to kill anybody. I just want some food. So pile up a plate. Come on, move it! Dammit! OK, mister, lower the weapon. You want to prosecute, Mr. Dawson? I certainly do. But, father, he just wanted something to eat. Mayor, take him to the jail. CODY: As I recovered from my wounds, the killing and the raping continued. [gunshots] [gunshots] Duke would return from long rides and tell me of the brutality of Hog and his men. [woman crying] Where's the cocaine you stole from me, Keylow? [grunting] HOG: There she is. Nice little tweeties on this one. She's making my blow fries. Oh this is going to be sweet, real sweet. Fucking piece of cake. I kind of like the icing myself. Listen, if there is any icing on this cake, I'll be the first one to taste it. You understand? Hey, when are we going to have some fun in this town? Right now. [guitar music playing] [clapping] [happy laughter] [clapping] [tires screeching] [loud crashing] CODY: Hog's attacks were random and they were fatal. [menacing laughter] [gunshots] [menacing laughter] [gunshots] [gunshots] The Agopy people needed something or someone to save them. Ammunition, well, it was a scarce commodity. So Duke would make his own shells and his own weapons. He'd tinker with bits and pieces of steel and turn out a straight shooting firearm like you never saw. He was pretty resourceful for an old mountain man. Hey you, wake up. [dog barking] You going to eat this food? Keylow? Bolie? Mr. Karate himself. Bolie? Bolie Johnson. Well, I'll be damned. How are ya, Bolie? I ain't surprised to find you here. You fit right in with the rest of the yellow bellies in this town. You always did have a sense of humor. So did the rest of the men in the platoon. Don't die if you laugh enough. I thought you got killed. I thought I had too when that last missile hit. They sewed me back together pretty good. You know a steel plate in the head and all that? At least I didn't turn chicken shit and run. And to think I considered you my best friend. You ain't nothing but a coward! You really don't know what happened! All I know is that our platoon was in trouble and we trusted you with the radio. And we needed a backup. You were supposed to radio for help. You just ran. You just ran off with the radio. We should have known better than to trust a drunk and on top of that a cheat! DUKE: Yeah, this is what you call a jail house booze. A make it from fermented potatoes. CODY: And as soon as I was on my feet, the Duke put a gun in my hand. [gunshot] It was a new experience for an Agopy preacher. [gunshots] Will you teach me how to shoot like that? All right. First thing you've got to learn is how to hold a gun. [gun barrel spinning] Now don't grip it so tight. It's got to be an extension of your arm. [gunshots] That's damn good. How good are you on the draw? My what? On the draw. How quick are you? Now, put your gun up in your waistband and then draw down on me. Are you serious? Not bad. Not bad. Let me tell you something, son. If you're going to carry a gun, you've got to learn how to use it. Now your aim is not too bad, but that ain't enough. That's only part of it. You mean I've got to learn to get my gun out faster. You've got to learn how to observe the other fellow. Look at his eyes. Watch his hands. Let him act first. It's always better to be the reactor. [choking] Tastes like gasoline. [snickering] Hey listen, if you're gonna learn how to shoot like a cowboy, you have to learn also how to smoke and how to drink. You know you handle a pistol pretty good. I thought you preacher people didn't believe in guns. Where did you learn how to shoot? You really want to know? I was a police officer. You were a cop? Holy shit. I never really shot anybody. My wife and two children were killed when the bomb hit. I kind of fell apart. That's when my sister took me in. She's an Agopy. So that was your sister and her family that got slaughtered? Yeah. Say, what's with the two different color shells here? Well, the red one, that's cause their distance from the rifle and the power of a cannon. And the white one, be careful with that one. That's a fire shot. Cody? Is that you? [loud thump] Oh! All right, just don't move old man. Dusty! DUSTY: Yeah? Go in and get the food and water. Take everything you want. No need to kill. What's the matter, old man? You scared? Huh? You know I take pleasure in killing? Hey, hey, hey. Food and booze. And a gun. So you're a cowboy, huh? You must know how to do the barnyard shuffle. Let's find out. Can you dance, old man? [gunshots] Well, if it ain't a preacher. Preacher man, I don't think you have the guts to pull that trigger. I think he's serious, man. I think he's too chicken shit. He's gonna shoot Shoot him, Dusty. Shoot the bastards! Cody, shoot them! Hey, Dusty. Watch this. Duke. [gunshots] [groaning] [laughter] [gunshots] Duke! Jim. God, you are gorgeous. Look what I found. Deputy dog. [laughter] HOG: My name is Hog. And I want you all to listen. I now own and control all of your possessions. Now for all of you that don't believe what I'm saying, I guess I got to give you an example. I need a volunteer. I think I got one over here. Thor, Bring me the sheriff. [laughter] Now, I want to show you what happens when you disobey me. If you're innocent, you've gonna live. But if you're guilty you're gonna die. [gun clicking] [menacing laughter] [gun clicking] Die. [gunshots] [screaming] [menacing laughter] She's mine. You understand me? Now it's time for me and you to go someplace, baby. MAN: Hey, Hog. Gotta go pick up some guns at Reed's. It's a 20 hour drive. We better get going now. I'll save you for later. You see that girl? No one touches before I do first. Do you understand me? [coughing] [struggled laughter] You sure got those bastards. Ah kid, that's some good shooting. Don't talk, Duke. I just got the bullet out. You're going to be all right. You know I'm not going to be OK. A man knows when death bites him in the ass. Listen. In that bureau dresser over there. In that bottom drawer. Open it up. Go on. Go on. Ah, isn't that beautiful? That's beautiful. It's yours. I'm giving it to you. I want you to go after the rest of those slimy bastards. I want you to do me another favor. I've never been a Bible reading man but would you-- would you read me something from the Bible? Sure. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. Yea I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. And death finally did bite Duke in the end. He was a good man, Lord. MRS. DAWSON: Shawna. Shawna. Hurry up. They've only given us two minutes. Come on, honey. You've been in the lake long enough. Remember, the radiation isn't good for you. [kissing] Leave her alone! [laughter] Hey, you guys. Let's have a party! Guitar player, what you doing? Taking a break? Why don't you play something? What do you want with us? Shut up, old man. [laughter] Hoo whew. Guitar player, why don't you show me your g-string. Get up. Why don't you take off this blouse. Yeah, come on. [laughter] [woman crying] Why don't you leave her alone! Maybe you'd like to join her. Let her go, man. She's Hog's property. Remember what he said? This one is all for himself. Yeah, but one more word out of her and I'll forget that she's Hog's property. All right, take off the dress. Come on! Take it off! Take it off! Take it off! Come here. [screaming] Well, well, well. What have we got here, huh? Preacher man. Look, you're a preacher man. Maybe, you can do some preaching. Well, what are you waiting for? Go preach. [laughter] Come on, get your guitar. We gonna have us a concert. Get these people out the way. Come on! Come on. Get on the table. Hurry up! [laughter and cheering] MAN: Come on. Turn around. Shake it! Come on! Play us a song, baby. I love you too. [laughter] If thou do that, which is evil be afraid. For he bareth not the sword in vain. For he is the minister of God, the revenger to execute wrath upon him that doath evil. He's a pretty good preacher man, huh? Amen! And if any mischief shall follow, thou shalt give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot. [gunshots] CODY: And it was right then and there that I changed my sermon forever. Hey! You're nothing but sick perverts! No! [men cheering] [gunshots] There he is! [gunshots] I missed. [gunshots] This is weird, man. Get out of here! [loud explosion] If you're out there, we just want to thank you. Thank you for saving our lives. If there's anything we can do for you, anything at all. We owe you. Just tell us what you want. Anything at all. All right, guys. Ah, gentlemen. Gentlemen. Please sit down. So, do you have anything for me? Where are the guns? Giles? 15 repeaters. 10 single actions. You men have come a long way. Will you be my guests this evening? MAN: Why should we say no? Is there anything else you'd like? I'll let you know. My name is Mr. Banes. They call me the Mayor here, because I am the spokesperson for the Agopy communty. And what might your name be? Calloway. Cody. Well, Mr. Calloway or can I call you Cody? We sure are glad you showed up when you did. Aren't we, gang? Yes. What brings you to our town? I'm looking for somebody. Who might that be? Does it matter? MAN: Are you looking for a friend of yours? I wouldn't say that. MAN: Then why are you looking for him? I'm going to kill him. We'd like to offer you a job. CODY: A job? Doing what? A job as our sheriff. Now, just one minute. I can't take any more of this. It's one thing when a man goes around killing people but when he wears a Agopy clothing, claiming to be a man of God, that's another thing. And you want him to be sheriff? And where a gun and kill? This is going too far. Oh, shut up, Dawson! Look at him. He smokes. He drinks. He kills. There's nothing godly about him. Take off those clothes. You aren't good enough to be an Agopy. You're dirt, mister. I don't want to be your sheriff. Besides, looks like the trouble's gone. Not quite. See, when he finds out you ran his gang out of town, he's going to be pissed. Who? Hog. Sheriff, huh? Hey, man. Say, are you the new Sheriff in town? I didn't think you Agopy people carried guns. Hey. Hey, I'm talking to you. Now, why don't you just let me out of here? I'll tell you what. You just let me out of here and I'll be on my way. OK? Stupid fool. Don't you know Hog's going to come back here and kill you and the rest of the people in this town? All right. Hey, thank you, man. Hey, you're a good dude. You unlock this door and I'll be on my way. Now give me one good reason why I shouldn't blow your head off. What's this? You're my new deputy. You're full of shit, man. You can leave when the job's done. What job? After Hog comes back. Oh, get real. Are you crazy? Who's going to stand up to him and his guys? We are. And what if I don't want to? What if I just split? Then I guess you just leave. I'm gonna go get some sleep. Hey, wait a minute. Hey, we ain't finished here yet. Hey, what am I supposed to tell people when they see me outside my cell wearing a gun? Just show them your badge. What happened? Thor and Gross are dead. How many were there? I could only see one. You're telling me that Thor and Gross are dead and you guys got run out of town. And it's all because of one person? We could hardly see him, Hog. Well, his ass is mine. And this town is history. I don't want anybody left alive. Do you understand me? Yeah. Now let's go back to the camp and get the rest of the guys. Now, listen to me everybody. We've got two shotguns and three handguns. I want anyone who's capable of pulling a trigger to take a gun. Calloway, most of us have never even touched a gun. When Hog finds out his men are dead, he's going to come back to this town and take it apart. From what you told me, he's got enough guns to do it. Now, listen. We all have to stick together. WOMAN: Do you really think we stand a chance against these guys? No. But if we don't try, we don't stand a chance at all. Mayor. Mr. Dawson. You are without a gun. OK, I'd like to have you two up on the roof. Mary, you and John take the other side of the street. Now, listen. We don't have much ammunition so I want you to make every shot count. There's something I've been meaning to ask you. Why did you stay? I got no place to go. I'd like to help. Give the man a gun. No way. This guy's a waste. He's a warm body. Give him a gun. You can't depend on him. He'll just run away. No he won't. How do you know? Because he's got no place to go. [knock on door] Who's out there? I'll shoot. [gun clicking] Please. Who is it? It'll be all right, baby. I'm much better now. I love you, Cody. I love you too. I really do believe that God sent you into my life. You just keep on believing. I also believe that we'll always be together. Do you? Like I said you just keep on believing. Now, I've got to go check on the others. I'll be back. I just came to check on everybody. How soon do you think it'll be? I figured they'll be here by morning. I brought this gun just in case. It's loaded. You know, I guess it won't hurt to say a few prayers. Mr. Calloway. Wait! I thought you could use this. Thanks, mother. What are you doing here? You should be back in the church. For what, and miss all the fun? You can't get rid of me now. How long do you think we'll have to wait? Cody said he thought the gang would arrive here by daybreak. You like him, don't you? Yeah. I love him. I know. How do you know? A mother can tell when her daughter's in love. You've changed in the past few days. You're more like a-- more like a woman now. I know father's not too happy with me right now. But I can't live my life for him. I have to live it for myself. If Cody makes you happy, you have my blessing. Thanks, mom. I hope you can still shoot straight. Guess we'll find out. Hey, Keith. You told me in the jail that I didn't really know what happened that day. I mean, I know what I saw. I saw you panic and run off with the radio. The radio was our only way of calling for backup. Does it really matter? To me it does. I ran with the radio. That's true. But there was one thing nobody was aware of. The radio never worked. It hadn't worked for days. Why didn't you tell us? Don't you remember the condition the rest of the soldiers were in? We were out of food, medicine, and scared shit-less, almost in shock. That radio was their only hope, man. As long as they had hope, they had a chance of survival. I just couldn't tell them the radio was broken. You ran off with the radio because you thought the enemy would go after you. Because the man with the radio was the most valuable. I'm gonna go check on the others. Have you seen Cody? SHAWNA: No. We haven't. Cody, where the hell are you? Hey, have you seen Cody? Last time I saw him he was saddling up his horse and running away. Where's Cody? Shawna, I think he's deserted us. I think he's gone for good. I can't believe that. I won't believe that. Hey, look. Here they come. Here they come. [gunshots] [gunshots] [glass breaking] [gunshots] [laughter] [bullets ricocheting] [gunshots] [shotgun firing] [bullets ricocheting] Drop the shotgun, preacher man. Come on Down. [gunshots] All right. Come on down. Now! [gunshots] Get out here! I'm out of bullets. Come on! I'm out of ammunition. Do we have anymore? No. Now, put the guns down and get down here. Lay down the guns. Guess what I'm going to let you do before I kill you? I'm going to let you give me a big blow-job. [screaming] [gunshots] [gunshots] [rapid gunfire] [gunshots] Bingo. Take this old lady and put her with the rest of them. You're coming with me. Woo! Yeah! Whoa! [gunshots] Can't anybody in this town shoot straight? [glass breaking] [gunshots] [rapid gunfire] [gunshots] Where are you? I'm going to find you. You son of a bitch. Drop that gun. Drop it! Put your hands over your head. Don't kill me, man. You dumb son of a bitch. [explosion] [explosion] No more gunfire. Guys should be back anytime. (WHISPERING) What's so funny? He's doing it. Doing what? He's bringing them out into the open. Forcing them to act first. Act first? He the reactor. Shut up! Shut up, old man. Why don't you leave us alone. You're gonna get killed, little bitch. [gunshot] [screaming] Bolie! [gunshots] Keylow! Finished this time, Bolie. Yeah, we did. No. No. Please, God. No. What took you so long, man? [gunshots] The church. Jim! Where's Shawna? Hog's got her. He took her over that way. [gunshot] SHAWNA: No. MAN: Hog! What? Most of the men have been killed. Get inside! [shawna groaning] SHAWNA: Please, no. No. God! [shawna crying] [crying] No! [shawna crying] Move and you're a dead man. Oh, Cody! [laughter] Rad, kill the son of a bitch. [laughter] Kill him. I'll be down by the railroad track. SHAWNA: No! [laughter] Now I'm the sheriff. [gunshots] [guns clicking] [laughter] [painful groaning] [gunshot] Come on, honey. CODY: Shawna! No! I oughta blow your brains out. Dammit, preacher! [gunshots] [gun firing] [gunshots] Cody, I'm sorry for the way I treated you in the past. I was wrong. I hope you can forgive me. Shawna, I don't know what to say except I'm sorry. So glad it's all over. There won't be anymore violence, Cody. Hey. Hey, you. Now, before I take this town apart, why don't you tell me where we can get something to eat. There's a cafe down at the end of town. See you later. [thugs laughing] Bang, bang. You're dead.
