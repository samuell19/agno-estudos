Lan. It's me. Your sister. Towards the end, did she suffer? There were a few things I wanted to say to her. If she were sitting right here, do you know what I would say? You're pathetic! I pity you! I lived a life so much more interesting than yours! I was so happy when Grandma took me away! Too bad she's dead. I can't say these words to her. Lan. Go, pack your stuff. Make yourself at home. We tie this firmly this way. See? It's like a butterfly. Lan, mama loves you. You know that, right? Hong, come over. Come over, now. Come over. - Come over! - No. Come over. - No! - Stay still! I don't want this. Please stop! It hurts! It hurts so much, mom! Please don't. Stop it, mom... No, stop! That was rubbish. Teacher, be stricter to her Grandma. What is it? Does getting older make you sad? What do you mean? I'm not old. The older we are, the wiser we become. There are more things to remember. There's nothing to be sad about. The world we live in is becoming messier. People... are getting so much more complicated. People care about things they shouldn't care about. Forgetting about things they should never forget. I'm actually really happy. As everything continues going downhill, I won't be around to see it. This is the script for tomorrow's audition. "What has become of my past "and where is it? "I used to be young, "happy, clever, "I used to be able to think "and frame clever ideas, "Before, "the present and future seemed to be full of hope. "Why do we, almost before we have begun to live, "become dull, gray, uninteresting, lazy, "apathetic, useless, unhappy?" Mama, I'll take you to the hospital. No, don't. Hospital... Don't leave me behind. I won't, I'll stay with you. I'll stay by your side, mama. Don't be afraid. That's 2 ringgit. My mother wants to see you. What do you really want? Bitch! Speak up! Get your hands off me! Some small change I owed her that night. Take it, take it, take it! Mama. For me? Do you like it? I'm constantly reminded, when I look up at the sky and there's an airplane. Question... how can something like that disappear. I appeal to all of our partners to continue volunteering any and all information that could help with the investigation and the search for MH370. When you were a kid, you loved listening to my stories. I had to tell you all kinds of stories to convince you to go out and catch crabs with me. I sound like an old woman, always talking about the past. I feel as if I have lived through several lifetimes. Remember how when we were kids, each day would feel so long? Those long, endless afternoons... Do you hate me? Twenty years... Do you blame me for not seeing you and mom after Grandma took me away? That we lost twenty years? That's great. I'm relieved. I just want you to talk to me, that's all. We could talk about anything, you know? Do you like the colour of this bed? What should we have for supper? Do you want to drink something? Just tell me anything! I guess you do hate me. Little Lan? Little Lan. It doesn't hurt anymore. I'm okay now. This will not separate us, you know? Little Lan, don't hate me. Mama. What did you say? Don't hate me. You know I don't. Even when I close my eyes, there's no darkness. There's just a blinding light. And both of you. Please don't hate me. Even if I were to die, all I want is for you to be happy. Yes. I understand, mama. But it's just so difficult! What has become of my past and where is it? I used to be young, happy, clever. I used to be able to think and frame clever ideas. Before, the present and future seemed to be full of hope. We barely begin to live, and all of a sudden, we're old and boring and lazy and useless and unhappy. This town has been here for two hundred years, and it has 100,000 people in it. Not one of whom is in any way different from the others. There has never been, now or any other time. Where is the leader? Where is the scholar? Where is the artist who can arouse envy or a passionate desire to be emulated? Okay. Next. Lately, I've been having very strange dreams. I dreamt that we both became adults. I saw a lot of shrimps placed outside the houses. Yes, the dried shrimps. Dried shrimps? Who exactly are making them? On this island, the husbands catch the shrimps, the wives dry them. The wives have to do it, but it's a tough job. Our younger villagers would rather leave the island. They'd rather move to Kuala Lumpur, huh? It's a dying industry. Hello? Yes? Did this place change much? No, it's still the same. How can that be possible? It's been so long already. You saw the tour group from China just now? Apparently, a few months ago, a Chinese film crew came here for a shoot. Huge group. Booked every single hostel here for 3 months. Even the local assistant director made 20,000-30,000 ringgit a month. China's loaded, man. He was probably just exaggerating. Someone I knew just died. Don't you ever get tired of this? What is it, Hong? Where's your little sister? Why aren't you looking after her? You have your passport? Warm clothes? Boots? What's the weather like in Japan now? If it weren't for the rehearsals I would have come along. Ms. Junko Takamine? Please come in. Her appearance might be a shock. Can you confirm that it's her? Is she your sister? Our condolences. Cause of death is marked as strangulation. She said she was from China. But to some others, she said she was from... Taiwan or Hong Kong. No one knew where she really came from. When was the last time you saw her? It's been a few years. Quite a while. Did she ever talk to you? Yes. We were always together. I see. Do you want me to get anything? You are just like them. Leaving without saying a single thing. You. Mother. Father. It's always like that. Did you know... All along, your sister was using your name? Hong. That's what I've called her these few years. There's something I need to give you. What's this? I think it's like her diary. She kept it until the very end. Did you read it? No. But I think you should keep it. Thank you. "August 19th, 2016.

Are you all right? Yeah. You know, When I always try to think of my sister, I can only remember her as a child. Can you tell me more about her? I find myself oddly situated in my mid-thirties. My youth belongs to the distant past. The period of my memory beginning with the end of my youth and extending to the present has not left me a single vivid impression. Feels as if there's a barrier which separates me from my youth. I still hear sounds from that part of my life. Yet, there's no way to penetrate that barrier. My name is Ai Ling. I'm from Taipei. Nice to meet you. My name is Ai Ling. I'm from Taipei. Nice to meet you. My name is Ai Ling. I'm from Taipei. Nice to meet you. My name is Ai Ling. I'm from Taipei. I'm from Taipei. I'm Wei Wei. I'm from Singapore. Are you feeling lonely? Hello there. I'm Xiaoming from Shanghai. I'm an exchange student. Do you need company? Anyone here? 'Scuse me? Mister Wang. Hey beautiful, is my suit ready? It's ready, please hold on. Hey Ai Ling, wanna go for dinner first? Where should we go? Lots of options here. - I know a great Shandong restaurant. - Shandong? Here you are. Ai Ling, I want you to wear this tonight. Oh my! Are you asking me to cross-dress now? No, no, I just want you to dress up like me. Be like you? You're so kinky. Bye! Thank you, sir. It's here! So cute. Hao Kan. ('pretty' in Mandarin) Hao kan. Hao kan. Hao kan. Look at this. He's my son. He's living with my parents now. I told them I'd come back soon. But I haven't gone back for 5 years. Why not? I'm scared. People like me should never have children. One day, after watching a movie, she stopped in front of a cemetery by the station. She told me that it's a good resting place. It's different from her own country. Even if it's been 10 years, 50 years, or a century... the graves are still looked after very well. She was surprised to see so many houses near cemeteries, that the residents are not superstitious at all. She said... How wonderful it is then, not to be feared as a ghost. How wonderful it is then, not to be feared as a ghost. I'm sorry, can I borrow your phone? Mine's not working. Sure. Come in. - There you go. - Thanks. Hello? Sister Yue? Sorry, my phone isn't working. Can you tell me the address again? Wait a sec. Sakuragicho... One Hotel. Okay, I'll be there soon. Wait, that's not the rate we agreed upon. I checked my account today, my advance isn't there. Sister Yue, you said you would help me. This isn't just about the money. All right, I'll see you tonight. Thanks. Here, for you. No, that's not necessary. Can I use the phone one more time? Go ahead. Thank you. Hello, it's me. You can stop pretending, I know you're listening. I'm not coming back. Also, all the songs you sang to me, I hated them all. That's it. Bye. My number. I don't know your name. Where are you from? Where do you come from? Guizhou. Guizhou? Taipei. Is that so? Singapore. I see. Hong. That's my name. Hong. I'm sorry. I thought something was wrong. I can't sleep at night. My wife's. I used to live here with her. Divorced? Something like that. Something like that... Maybe. Do you think she'll come back to you? Yes. Hong? How do you write your name? Hong Niji. Same as a rainbow. Suits you. Lan ("Tempest") Lan. Hong. My name is Hong. I am Hong. I am Hong. You're pathetic! I pity you. I lived a life so much more interesting than yours! My wife... She was more than 10 years younger than I was. During the day, she worked in a DVD rental shop. At night, she was studying to be an English teacher. I had a normal office job. Our marriage seemed perfect. She was having an affair with a colleague. When I found out, she wept and begged for my forgiveness. I knew that she still loved me very much so I forgave her. After that, we got closer. The day before she left, I had a horrible dream. In my dream, we were both in the car. I drove her every week. It was a familiar route. But somehow, I lost control of the wheel. The last thing I heard was her scream. My wife sat beside me, unconscious. Hey, are you okay? And just out there, there was a child. A boy who had been hit by the car. He was lying there. His head... His tiny hands... A part of his head was gone. And his eyes... I can never forget those eyes. Hong? Did she ever talk about me? No. I'm sorry. Please tell me more about her. She loved going to the mountains with me. Away from the city. That was where... they found her body. The last time we came here, it was autumn. We sat here just like this and ate together, Lan. I haven't told anyone about you. I kept pretending that you had never existed. Do you know how sad it makes me feel? There is always a slight feeling of sorrow in me. There is no word for the sorrow I feel. I cannot explain it with words. It is futile. I realize now the shadows of grandmother and mother have remained in my body. Even now, in another country, at a place of such breathtaking beauty, I cannot get rid of the sadness that is devouring me from within. Lan These birds sound pleasant, don't they? It's been so long. I have missed you so much. Hong. Lan... Big sis. Are you still in pain?
