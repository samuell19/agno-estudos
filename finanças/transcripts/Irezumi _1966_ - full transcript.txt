What are you going to do to me? The moment I set eyes on you, your body enchanted me. What are you doing to me? The beauty of your skin is so rare. It's one in a thousand. One in a million. I have searched so long in vain... for the perfect female skin. What are you doing?

Miss Otsuya... Enter quickly. Tie my sash. Are they all asleep? Even the shop clerk? Yes. Even the housemaid and all the shop girls. Of course. I've sent them all to bed early. Ready to go, Shinsuke? I've taken some money. They won't miss it. You guard it. First you make me run away with you... and now you also turn me into a thief. I pity your kind father... Too late for regrets. If we stay here, we'll never marry. And I want to marry only you. Shinsuke, you've seduced me, the daughter of your boss... only to dump me at the last moment? Not at all. Never! Then take me away from here. It's tonight or never. My parents have gone away. They won't return before dawn. We're still young, so don't look so gloomy. You must know: I need you to love me without regard for what people say. To be with you... is all I desire. Love me! Let's do it, quickly. It hurts! Don't squeeze my hand so hard. You're much stronger than you appear. Otsuya... Please wear socks. I like to go barefoot. Elegant like a geisha. I love the sound of that bell. You're so carefree. It feels like we're actors in a kabuki play. Young lovers eloping. Otsuya, let's return to the pawnshop. We'll freeze to death before we reach Gonji's inn. Let's wait for another day. You're such a coward. - Do you plan to dump me? - Never... I've heard enough. Go on and hurry home. I'm not turning back. I've deserted my parents for you. How can I go on living if you abandon me? Better to drown myself. Let go. I want to die! Not so fast. Don't throw away your life. I've made up my mind. I will do as you say. Shinsuke... are you sure? Let's drink. - Please treat your people, too. - Thank you. You're very generous. Come on, Shinsuke. It's only natural to have the lovely Otsuya and her father's apprentice... live and love under the same roof. Maybe you find me bizarre... but when I see young lovers suffer... I want to jump in and help. You are really bizarre. You promised to take us in, so I came to you, Gonji. I know your father well. Our business goes way back. Let me work on him... and convince him to let you marry. If he won't allow me to marry Shinsuke... I will choose to die. This is Captain Gonji's ship. You're safe here. Try not to show yourselves until things are arranged. Enjoy some good times here. He bit the hand that feeds him. Stop crying. All this time I have pampered him. Only to let him rob my daughter. What a cunning devil. And then Otsuya! She spurns the prospect I arranged. I'll disown her for life. If they love each other that much, why not let them marry? Are you mad? Gonji, you know lots of people. Please find them. With pleasure. I know Edo like the back of my hand. Let me find them for you. This is just an advance. Please. Ten days have passed... but Gonji has no news. Stop brooding, Shinsuke. Why care if the answer's no? To spend day after day together with you is perfect bliss. I don't want to go home. Don't you overdo it a bit? You don't even eat meals. It's unhealthy to stay in your room clinging together all the time. I'm off. - Come back soon. - Yes. Where is Shinsuke going? Our money's running low. He's going to pawn my hairpins. I can lend you money, if you want. Where's Gonji? He's been out since early morning. They've a game going in the back. Have a look, if only to kill time. - Three more bottles. - In a moment. Place your bets. It's you, Gonji. Gonji, you pig! What do you think you're doing? - Santa, is the boat ready? - Yes, madam. Otsuya... What? - Let's get off this boat. - Leave here? Why? I hate to sponge off Gonji any longer. We've waited long enough. Let's marry. Don't feel bothered by Gonji. Just do as you like. Excuse me. The boss is dining out at Kawacho. Shinsuke... he's meeting your parents. What? My parents? They'll settle things for you. He asked me to take you there. Can you manage alone, or should I come, too? Why not stay alone for just one night. It might do you good. Let's go. Shinsuke, don't keep them waiting. I have a bad feeling. Whatever happens, come back soon. My husband is there. You have nothing to worry about. Get going! Thanks for coming, Shinsuke. Too bad. Your parents waited all this time, but they've just left. You should have hurried. What did my father say? He condemns you for running off with the boss's daughter. But should her father allow it... he's prepared to accept the marriage. He has a great heart. Be glad that your dad is so understanding. What about my boss and his wife? Don't worry. I've almost talked him round. You mean, he'll forgive us? I'm sure he will. He'll make you his successor. Let's drink to that. Santa, I have to hurry home. You keep Shinsuke company. Thank you for everything. Come on, Shinsuke. Drink up. What do you want? Tie her legs. Gonji, what are you up to? Quick, the palanquin. Let's hurry. Shinsuke... You drank too much. How do you feel? I'll be fine. Can you walk? Damn, my lamp went out. Santa! What's the matter? Where are you? You dirty drunk! Santa... Where are you? You bastard. Wipe that silly look off your face. Gonji ordered me to bump you off. You'll have to die. What about Otsuya? Where is she? By now she's been brought to a geisha house. She's been sold off. Die! Help me! I've killed him. I am... I'm a murderer. Otsuya... Where did they take you? I want to see you... before they'll arrest me. - Is Mr Tokubei at home? - Yes, he awaits you. Nice work. Take off the gag, Gonji. Poor thing. I'm thirsty. Bring me water! Bring water. Untie me, too! The lady has guts. To you I'm valuable merchandise. A bruise might spoil me. You're something else. Listen, Otsuya... I run the geisha house in this area. My name is Tokubei. Gonji has sold me your body. Like you guessed, I wish you no harm. I'll smarten you up to make you the finest geisha around. See how interesting this painting is? A superb woman... trampling the corpses of countless men at her feet. Feasting on their flesh and blood to grow and prosper. Tell me... Don't you think... she resembles you? Look closer. I don't care. Does the resemblance scare you? Let go of me. Look closely. She's your dead ringer. You must become a geisha like her. Do like her and feed on men... to make me rich. Never! I'll make sure you will... by engraving a mark on your body. A beautiful and superb mark. Meet Seikichi. One of Edo's finest tattoo artists. He insists on practising his needle art on your skin. The spider is moving. Painful, isn't it? The spider's embrace is strong. Look! Look in the mirror. On your back... lives a golden orb-web spider. This joro spider... will kill countless lusty men... and you will gorge on their corpses. In this creature... I have infused... the soul of my tattoo art. It's my whole life. So it's your life... that I have sucked up. That makes you... the first man I have gorged on. It feels great! Shinsuke. What have you done? Ma, let me eat something. Ten days ago... your boss the pawnbroker came here. What a fool you were to run off with his daughter. His wife stays in bed, sick with worry. He planned to open a branch in a few years... and to make you an associate. What has come over you? He treated you well all these long years. But you spit him right in his face. Mother. I love his daughter. I forbid you to say that. She's out of your league. You're just a lowly apprentice. She is daughter to a shopkeeper. You defiled your master's daughter. Your life is ruined now. Condemned to live forever... in this squalor and poverty. Ma... Did the police come by? Why would they? What did you do? Nothing. Whatever it was you did... they'll catch you. Turn yourself in. But I've done nothing. Is that the truth? Yes. In that case, Shinsuke... return Otsuya to her home. Perhaps the master will forgive you. Go and do it. I will. When I meet Otsuya. You can't go like this. I was expecting you, so I prepared this. Put on these clothes. Leave before dad returns. If he finds you here, he'll raise hell. Seize this last chance... or you'll end up down below with the worst scum. Ma... We won't meet again. What do you mean? Take good care of yourself. Farewell. Father... Forgive me. I barely christened you Somekichi... but already you're the talk of the town. You're gifted, clever... and the prettiest geisha in Fukagawa. They all splurge big money on you... in the vain hope to own you someday. That money disappears into your pocket. Are you pleased? I taught you how to feed on men... but your excellent skills surprised me. Thanks to that spider on my back. Not only that. You're a born man-eater. Watch what you say. Men like you have made me this way. I'm only taking revenge. To swindle those jerks out of their money is such a relief. I need you to gorge on me too. That will cost you. Since I've paid my debt... I work for my own money now. Take this. Not tonight. Gonji expects me. Don't get involved with that villain. He forced you into this work. He cheated your dad, pretending to search you... pocketing a generous fee. On top of that... he sold you to me for a fortune. You have him to thank for all your misfortune. I'll make him pay for his deceit. Somekichi... I've always been crazy about you. Be my concubine. How dare you? You, who sold me to Tokubei. I had to allay my wife's suspicion and Tokubei was very insistent. Poor excuses don't suit you. You're a crook, so act like on. Tell me the truth. Did you try to kill Shinsuke? That wasn't me. Shinsuke got drunk, killed Santa and fled who knows where. A coward like Shinsuke could never kill a man. Who cares? Since you love me so much, I'll be yours. But as your wife, not as mistress. Okay, fine. And your wife, Otaki? I can dump her whenever I like. Listen, Gonji... To avoid that she becomes a nuisance later... you'd better kill her. Kill her? Don't tell me a villain like you doesn't dare to. Kill her... and I'm your wife, there and then. Hurry up and do it. Otsuya. It's me. Shinsuke. Why are you here? Two months now I've been a delivery boy to get into the geisha houses. Hoping to find you again. I see. Come inside. Hana! Don't be so shy. This is my own place. Good evening, madam! Whoever asks, tell them I'm out for a few days. Got that? I'm glad you are safe. I missed you. Forgive me. I'm no longer worthy of your love. My body is polluted. I killed a man. Don't Shinsuke. It's been a long time so let's drink. I wanted to see you one last time, not to have regrets. I'll turn myself in... or I'll kill myself. That's my choice. If you die, I'll lose my reason to live. You're still as timid as ever. If Santa had survived you'd be dead by now. Beware, Shinsuke. Honesty no longer pays. No one will look for you here. I'll provide for us both... and let you do as you like. After I'm arrested, I want you to quit this geisha life... and return to your parents. Will you do that for me? That's my last request, so please. I don't want go back to being a respectable woman. You like this work? Even when I was young I didn't object to it. With this body... I can never go back to normal. Take a look at my back. Since when... Do you still love me now? I can tell that you despise me. First dump me and then kill yourself. How cruel. You're wrong. I never expected to see you again. Now that you're here I'm ravished. I'll never allow you to turn yourself in... nor to die. Now hold me tight. Say: Sweet Otsuya. I'm so happy you're here. I might be a geisha... but you're my only true love. Love me with all your heart. Go and turn yourself in... but before that, stay with me a while. I missed you. I love you. Why do you go to Gonji? You'll witness an interesting scene, so come along. Is that you, Somekichi? Yes. This way. Come inside. I've just finished her off. Tough bastard. Put up a struggle, too. Let me see her expression when she died. Will you get rid of her body? I'll dump her in the bay. Where are your men? All sent on a spree in Yoshiwara. Now then, Otsuya... You are my wife. I'm already with a man called Shinsuke. Sorry, but I can't accept your marriage offer. You mean that living corpse? If he has the guts to appear, I'll kill him. Help me! Help me! Gonji! Shinsuke! Dirty swindler. Shinsuke... You've killed again. This is your second. Otsuya! Pull yourself together, Shinsuke. These two... sold me off as a whore and tried to have you killed. Good riddance. Feels good, doesn't it? Let's take his money too. Now that I have the money, Shinsuke, you can dump them in the bay. Hurry up and get rid of them. You want to borrow money? Yes, five gold pieces. How about working instead of sponging on me? I stopped doing tattoos. Nonsense. What a waste of talent. The spider on Otsuya's back is a masterpiece. It took possession of her and made her into a man-eater. That's why I quit. I'll never touch a needle again. You put all you had into that spider. It sucked you dry, and made you a coward. You're wrong. The girl terrifies me. What are you looking at? You've already killed two people. If you turn yourself in now, they'll tie you to a tree... and put a spear through your stomach. So stop being foolish... and stay here with me, always. Promise? Madam Otsuya. What? A gentleman called Tokubei waits downstairs. Still in bed? The sun is high in the sky. Part of the business. Work at night and sleep during the day. A client upstairs? No, I'm alone. Why did you come? Did you take in a lover boy? If I did, the spider on my back would weep. Or is it Shinsuke? Stop kidding me. Funny I said Shinsuke... because Gonji and his wife have disappeared without a trace. Gonji had to flee after his crimes were exposed. I'd say that Shinsuke did it. Go home if you have no business. To be honest, I need money so I found you a wealthy client. It's Serizawa, the samurai. That trick again? Right. Same plan as always. You feign love and ask refuge in his home. I burst in and extort the money. We share the loot. To live a free and exciting life you need money, right? Just like me. Listen, Somekichi. As long as the merchants brag they can buy you, I lose face. My rank as the Shogun's retainer forbids me to pay you. Will you become mine? You want to? I'm wealthy. Look, I'm handsome and strong. Be my concubine. If it were up to me, I would give myself to you here and now. Does Tokubei object? He ran up debts and to pay them off... he makes me work clients all year. That's the way he earns money, but its my body he's wasting. Listen... If you care about me, will you shelter me for a while? Shelter? I want to relax a bit, with you by my side. Then join me at my villa in Terajima. There's only a maid, so no need to be shy. - When can you come? - Tonight. That fast. Am I imposing? No, but... I'm surprised at how lucky I am. That's a promise then. He's a high-ranking samurai. Why would he fall for your sweet talk? That's my worry. In the end, he'll do whatever he likes with you. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Wringing money out of a samurai. What a scary woman you've become. Shinsuke. Soon we'll have 100 gold pieces. After I rip them off Tokubei, we'll decamp to Kyoto for a while. It will be exciting to live in a new environment. Remember you killed two people. Muster some of that courage. I've got an idea. If you are so worried about me, Shinsuke... then dress up as a geisha's aide and come to the villa at the right time. You'll look smart dressed as an aide. - What if Tokubei recognizes me? - You fool! Enter through the backdoor. When my father's business went bankrupt... it left my mother gravely ill... and I was the only one able to get them out of trouble. So they sold me to Tokubei for 100 gold pieces. Such filial duty is rare. Falling in Tokubei's hands was bad luck. These 3 years were a vale of tears. - Is Tokubei such an evil guy? - Please... deliver me from this pool of sorrow. If I heard well, 100 pieces will buy your freedom? Could you pay that to Tokubei? Do it today, so that I may be yours the sooner. - I see. - Excuse me, sir. What do you want? A man called Tokubei insists on seeing you. Show him in. Where should I hide? Go inside that closet. Pardon me. My name is Tokubei. I act as Somekichi's guardian. - Pardon me to bother you at this hour. - Don't worry. Come in. Mr Serizawa, time to stop joking. Joking? What do you mean? - What is your plan with my Somekichi? - Somekichi... What about her? I know that she's hiding here. You say she's here? Somekichi is a geisha who's worth a fortune to me. To recoup my investment I count on your wealth and sense of honour. Should you refuse, you will surely come to harm. What do you want me to do? That's up to you. If you pay me a 100 pieces... I'll take her back without stirring up trouble. Right. I get it now. Tokubei! I love women. Beautiful women I love even more. But not so much... as to fall for your scam and lose a fortune. Somekichi, get out now. I don't care you're on to us. You act smart, but take it from me: A real player needs deep pockets to pay for a geisha's flatteries. Petty miser. If your money is so dear to you then stay away from women. You sly foxes. Scum like you only defile my sword, but so be it. Say your prayers. You're mad. Why draw your sword? Your Lord won't forgive such a foolish act. He's just a phoney samurai. Kill him, Tokubei! Dammit, I'm hit! Come get it, bastard! I'll rid this earth of vermin like you. Somekichi! Wait, I'll cut you to pieces! Catch them! Let's run! Ouch! Somekichi... It hurts. Let me rest a bit. He cut my arm and thigh. I'll make him regret this! Tokubei, will you be okay? You're bleeding badly. Don't exaggerate. A slight scratch won't do me in. I'll survive if we go home and dress the wound. Damn that cheap samurai. Give me a hand so I can get up. I must go back home. You're losing too much blood. You won't make it back home. Stop the bleeding. Tokubei... Let me give you relief... with one stab, you'll be dead. What are you doing? Bitch, you've got a nerve! Coming at me with a razor. Hurry, Shinsuke! Just as I expected. Are you conspiring with her to kill me? Go ahead and try to kill me. I won't go easy. Somekichi, you're going with me to hell. Shinsuke! Tokubei knows that you're a murderer. It's now or never. Kill him! You bitch! Quick! Kill him! Don't wait any longer! Hurry! Do it, now! I can't breathe. He's killing me. Will you just stand by... and watch how he kills me? You bastard! I'll kill you! Somekichi... After I die my ghost will haunt you. Come and haunt me if you want. I don't give a damn. You almost let him kill me. Hold me. Killing people has become a mindless habit. It terrifies me. Shinsuke... Mutilate his face so nobody will recognize him. We'll bury him in a paddy and get it over with. Do as I say. I can't stand it. I'm better of dead. I've already killed three men. I'm finished. I beg you, Otsuya. Let's die together. Not so fast. Tokubei made me a geisha and had that bug engraved on my back. You can't imagine how painful it was... to suffer those needles. He's better off dead. He was devoured by the joro spider on my back. Tokubei had it coming. No need for regrets. At night... my victims haunt me in my dreams. I see their faces and limbs drenched in blood. Soon I'll go insane. I'd rather die. Stop drivelling. Better shore up your courage... and imagine how to kill dozens more. That'll teach you how to be tough. Because I hate cowards. What a horrible woman you've become. Blame the spider on my back. Madam... What is it? Come in. A client wants you to come. This early? Yes, he insists on seeing you. Sorry to keep you waiting. Come on in. The other night I lost control. Forgive me. I got carried away. How is Tokubei? I barely scraped him. Must be just a scratch. The doctor looked after him. He'll recover soon. By the way... I couldn't stand that you called me a miser. Here are the 100 gold pieces. I want you to have them. I can't accept your money. I need you as my concubine. Take the money. But after cheating you I even tried to kill you. If you were less tough I wouldn't even desire you. Once I'm yours, I'll squeeze as much money out of you as I can. I can only live by feeding on men. Does that scare you? No, it's more exciting. But why care about money... if you can kill me in my sleep? Between man and woman it's a fight to the death anyhow. Somekichi... Shut up and give yourself to me. I've lost my head over you. Serizawa... I'm in love with you. My love... I want you to love me all night long. You scared me. - Why did you stay over? - I'm a geisha. To work a client means looking sloshed and lying down with him. - What about this money? - A gift from my client. Who? What man can be this rich? Serizawa. Why would he give you money after what you did? Just small change, he said. My stroke of luck. He's so impulsive. You slept with him, or not? You're his now. He'd never give all this money if you hadn't. So what if I did? However sly and pretty I am, nobody pays me just for flatteries. Sleeping doesn't make me unfaithful, because I did it for you. Be thankful and shut up about it. Let's go to Kyoto with this money. - Over there we can live in peace. - Forget it. I'm not going. - It was your idea. - But I've changed my mind. - Because of Serizawa? - Stop it! Are you jealous? It was you who refused to go to Kyoto at first. I want more money. What should we do now? Can't we return to who we were? We can't. You nag about giving yourself up, about suicide, or the dead haunting you. Your cheerless sobbing gets on my nerves. I don't love you, I'm sick of you. It's time for you to know that Serizawa is not the only guy I slept with. There were more? That figures. I've been so stupid. Dammit, how could you fool me all this time? Beat me as much as you like. I love Serizawa, as you suspected. I adore him! Otsuya... forgive me. I didn't mean to. I hurt you. Forgive me. Tell me you love me... like before. I can't live without you. You're disgusting. Stop it! Don't touch me again. If you do, you'll make me vomit. This is my punishment. Retribution for cheating my boss. I should die. Die! Hana... Isn't it time to pay your folks a visit? But I need to look after Madam. I'll look after her. Sleep over at your folks tonight. They'll be glad to see you. You'll need some money. Take this. Will you stay with Serizawa tonight? I beg you, please don't go. I am Somekichi, the geisha. You can't order me around. So you are going? My pleas won't make you relent? Why, a thunderbolt in springtime. I'm going to die. You die, too! Are you going to kill... the woman you love? I kill you because I love you. We go to hell together. It was all my fault. Forgive me. I'll go to Kyoto with you. Liar! Don't cheat me. Believe me, I love you. I'll never go to Serizawa again. Hold me, please. You're lying. I don't believe you. We'll die together. Don't you believe me? Then kill me, please. To be killed by you is my deepest desire. Go ahead, kill me. One thrust through the heart, I beg you. Otsuya... You... you stabbed me. I didn't stab you. The spider on my back did. Forgive me. I don't want to die, I need to live. I must deceive all those bastards and make them pay. You did it again. You came at the right moment, Seikichi. Take all this money and give Shinsuke a proper funeral. All right. In exchange... show me the joro spider that I tattooed. I want see how she's alive with my own two eyes. If you want. Sucking the blood of all those men has invigorated her. How many more will she bite to death? Have you seen enough? Each time it feels... it's me who's doing the killing. I'm getting cold. Have you seen enough? I can't allow this spider to live any longer. Otsuya... Forgive me. He made me to. It was Tokubei who ordered me to. I should never have done it. My life has also come to an end. THE END translation: Geert van Bremen - JASPA Subtitling
