THE SHOPPING MALL MELTS IN THE EVENING SUN #HAIKU MARIA LIKED YOUR COMMENT Let's present the haikus we wrote today. Write your poem with your calligraphy pen on the paper strips I gave you. She kind of looks like a teacher. What are they doing? Okay, once you're done, I'll collect it from you. YAMAZAKURA All right. I will now recite the poems for you all. MALL MANNEQUINS WEAR YUKATA TOO - SASAKI "Mall mannequins wear yukata, too." "Mall mannequins wear yukata, too." By seeing the store mannequins in yukata, you can tell that it's summer now. You can feel the season. This was written by Mr. Sasaki. Let's look at the next one. -Cherry? -Yes? Can you come over here? This is my haiku. Please recite it for us. What! Is that a no? No, it's just… Reading in front of people is not really my style. But everyone wants to hear it. Please read it to everyone with your wonderful voice. The… The shopping mall melts in the evening sun What? Cherry, say it a bit louder. The shopping mall melts in the evening sun THE SHOPPING MALL MELTS… Thank you very much. Haiku… is a written art form. It doesn't have to be read aloud. That's true. But don't you think some scenes can only be conveyed when you read them aloud? But it does get across, even without being read aloud. The cicadas can be heard even by the girl behind her mask The cicadas can be heard even by the girl behind her mask So you're a year older? I… guess I am. Now I see why you're named Cherry. Your surname, "Sakura," means "cherry blossom." -Oh, right. -Cherry is a cute name. "Mr. Cherry"? Or maybe just "Cherry" sounds better. What are you listening to? Huh? Well… I've always disliked loud sounds. -I'm not actually listening to anything. -What? If I do this, I can get by without people talking to me. Oh, that's so smart. -A summer cold? -Huh? This is, um… Oh, why did you attach a dictionary to your phone? -Hm? Oh, that's a saijiki. -A "saijiki"? It's a dictionary used for writing haikus. There is an app version, too, but I like having the book more. You must like haikus. Haikus help me express things in words better. Or something. But I'm no good at… reading in front of people. -I sometimes upload it on Curiosity. -I get it. If it's online, everyone will look at it more. I totally get it.

Lights in the summer night… Lights in the summer night make a false start in the evening sunset Lights in the summer night make a false start in the evening sunset What do you mean by "lights in the summer night"? It's about "lights." It's a summer kigo, a seasonal word. A "kigo"… Lights in the summer night make a false start in the evening sunset It's so cute! Cute? Yeah. What part of it?

I wonder if Mr. Fujiyama is okay. Yeah. Maybe the record he's looking for… is inside that store. Yeah. But I wonder why he was always searching around the mall. Um… -I'm-- -By the way… you haven't worn them lately. I don't need them. Huh? It's nothing. Yamazakura… YAMAZAKURA RECORD About that record… The girl on the record had cute clothes, so I did an image search. The clothes were trendy about 50 years ago. So the record's from back then. Oh, this is about Mr. Fujiyama? Apparently he used to work here long ago. At the mall? No, no. Long ago, this used to be a record pressing plant. PHOTO ALBUM OF NOUVELLE MALL'S HISTORY ANNIVERSARY EXHIBIT These are Daruma Festival posters. They've had fireworks ever since the first festival. Yeah. This year is the 56th festival… So it's continued for over 50 years. Someone who used to work at the pressing factory? We hoped someone would know about its past. Does anyone know someone like that? Oh, right. Why don't you try Handoff on the third floor? They have old records there, don't they? We don't have any records called Yamazakura. I see. Oh, but I think that record might be a picture disc! A picture disc? It looks like this. What's this? It's so cute! Right? It's a limited-edition Hikarun record! Picture disc jackets often have a hole so that you can see inside. The one in your photo has a hole in the middle, too. I see. You're amazing, Japan. Oh, it's nothing. What? Is this a treasure hunt? Yeah, kinda like that. What? I wanna join too! Apparently this record is a picture disc. Does anyone recognize it? -Nope, no idea. -Never seen it before. -Any clues? -I'll ask my grandpa!

I heard she got sick and passed away soon after giving birth to me. I was really young, so I don't remember anything. My father opened this shop so that he could sell my mother's records. I see. We're actually shutting down this weekend. It's grown old and no one will take over. Yasuyuki's packing it up right now. Darn, this is tiring. Any progress? I'm working on it. Oh, it's you guys. Why are you two here? Just stopping by. Stopping by? I think Mr. Fujiyama… wants to hear Sakura's voice. That's why he's looking so hard for it. Um… I… Can I help pack up the records, too? -Huh? -What? The record that Mr. Fujiyama is looking for might be in here. Hey, hold on. Me, too! What? To be honest… I've looked, too.
