Love and war. The gods then decided humans would need a place away from these elements. A small island. This island, in the very center of the world. They called it Guava. And this place, so filled with magic of the gods and untouched by man's hand, blossomed and bore fruit unlike any other place on Earth. But the most amazing of all its bounty... was the Clayworm, a creature only found on Guava Island that spins the most beautiful blue silk man had ever seen. Every man who saw the silk fell in love with it. But wherever there is love, War will follow. The Red family took control of the silk, along with the people of Guava. Greed and distrust spread all across the island. The gods, fed up with our insolence, turned their backs on the humans and paradise was lost. My mother told me this story every night before bed, like her mother before her. To me, it was just a bedtime story. As far as I could tell, there was nothing for me on Guava. I longed to leave the island... to see the world outside. But one night... I heard my path. It was the most beautiful song I'd ever heard. But I was not going to say that. So, instead, I yelled... Keep trying! Practice is perfection. His smile, it was like moonlight. He said it was a shame I didn't like the song, because it was for me. But he promised to come back and play it every night until he sang a song as beautiful as me. Fortunately, no song is that beautiful. So I got to see and hear him every night. I dreamed of leaving the island with him, starting a new life, free from survival. But Deni could never imagine leaving. He loved the people and would give anything to be loved in return. His dream was to one day write a song that would unite the people of the island... a song that would remind us of the magic Guava had, even if just for one day. So we both kept dreaming. Because in the end... what else do we have but dreams? Practice is perfection. I can do it when no one is listening. Well, the part you didn't ruin was beautiful. It's funny. That's what my other girlfriends say. I was joking. I was joking. I was joking. Good morning, Deni. Good morning! Late again? Uh, not yet. Hi, Deni. Good morning. Good morning, Deni. Good morning, Paolo. Blessings to you this morning. Blessings to you. I set aside some meat for the party tonight. Only the best. Oh, yes. Save me some pork. It smells great. The goat is even better. Hey, Deni. Make sure you play "Casilla" for me, huh? I will not let you down, Gladys. I can't wait for the festival. Good morning, horse. Oh, no. Gracias. Oh! Hey, hey, hey! Hey. What? Give us your money. What? Give us all your money now. I can't understand you. You have a scarf on your face. No jokes. Okay. I don't have any money. You're lying. You play guitar on the radio. Dodo. I know it's you. Victor, I can see your face. Mapi, I'm helping you at church today. Why are you robbing me? We work for Red now. He said we could be soldiers. Well, you're making me late. And if I'm late, I don't get paid. And if I don't get paid, you have nothing to take. Come here. Do you guys know about the concert? What concert? Shh. It's a secret. I'm doing a festival tonight. If you guys let me go, I'll let you sit by the stage. Deal? Okay, Deni. You can go. All right. Gracias. Oh, and the concert. It is a secret. Sí. Secret. All right? I'll see you guys. Ciao, Deni.

They don't like it when I'm late. Then why did they hire you? See you this evening for the second show. See you! Bye, Deni. You know Red's gonna get you if you keep coming late. It's not late if everyone does it. I told you guys to sleep in an hour. You're gonna need your energy for the festival. So, you want us to skip work Sunday after we come in late Saturday? You're crazy. We're not supposed to be working Saturday. Well, make sure to fill out a complaint. The forms are in the bathroom. You're hilarious. You know what's really funny? You on Sunday when you have no job, no house and no girl. Kofi wouldn't leave me because I was broke. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with me is that we live in paradise, but none of us have the time or the means to actually live here. We work hard. We deserve a day off. The way I see it, we're just taking what's ours. Yeah, and Red's gonna take what's his... your life. Red runs the island. You just work on it. She's right. I heard that it's not like this when you get off the island. Like in America. What do you mean? It's different there. I heard people are their own bosses. I'm saving up enough to bribe my way off the island. Then I'll go to America and start my own business. Ha! It's funny? This is America. Guava's no different than any other country. I don't know about that, Deni. America is a concept. Anywhere where, in order to get rich, you have to make someone else richer, is America. You're an idiot. I'm an idiot? You're an idiot. I'm an idiot? Yes, you're an idiot. I'm an idiot? Yes, I'm sure you are. I'm an idiot. Ladies and gentlemen, please hand in your passports. Welcome to the United States, land of the free, where you... Yes, even you... Can be your own boss.

I'm a fan of yours. ♪ Red's Cargo ♪ ♪ Is the best cargo ♪ It's a good song. Please, take a seat. Uh, thank you. You know, I listen to you on my radio program sometimes. I don't listen to any other musician but you. You really stand out. Would you like a juice? Juice? Oh. Um, no. No, thank you. "Health is wealth," as my father said. Is that yours? My grandfather played the guitar. I always wanted to, but my fingers weren't quick enough, I think. I realized there was an easier way to enjoy life. You see, with art, you never know how people are gonna feel about it. It can be hard. Yeah, well, life is hard. You know, my grandfather used to say, "The man who doesn't enjoy the cracking of pistachio shells doesn't enjoy the work of a full life." And what would you consider a full life? Music? Marriage? That girl, Kofi. Kofi is a beautiful girl. You have good taste. Just like me. Some kids tell me you are performing tonight. All night long. Look. If people come to your festival tonight, they won't come to work tomorrow. Taking Sunday off is not an option. You understand? I like you, Deni. I like you. Mmm. $10,000 is enough to go wherever you want. Even enough to bring somebody with you. But I'm sorry. You can't play your festival tonight. I'm in charge of the people of this island. I have to do what's best for everyone. Yeah, but how do you know what's best for everyone? Now you have an excuse. You fell. I'll be listening out for your radio show. 5:00, right? You'll say there is no festival. Gracias. Sure. What happened to your face? I fell. Let me see. No, I'm good. I'm fine. Where's your guitar? It smashed when I fell. So, what are you gonna do tonight? I'll figure something out. What's going on right now? Uh, nothing. I'm on time. That's what's going on. No, that's what's scary. Buenos días. Thank you. Thank you. Let me look at that. No, no. I'm okay. I'm okay. So, how were the docks? You know. The docks. I moved this box over here to over there. What really happened today?
