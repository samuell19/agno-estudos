Fric-Frac, Noun. To steal or burglar with force Go on, Francis. Go for it! Faster! You can do it! He's going to do it! What's he on? He's caught up four times now. Look how fast he's peddling. Go on, Francis! His opponent's putting up a fight. - Mounting the ramp is cheating. - Francis is falling behind. - Book him! Take him down the police station! Atrocious behaviour! They're in cahoots! I wish I could whistle like you. - It's easy. - How do you do it? - Like this. - Like this? Amazing! He's overtaken your Francis. Francis is catching up, knucklehead. I'm telling you, he's had it. Get lost, baldy. He'll win it, no sweat. - Well said! - Can't you be polite? - Ignore him. He's a sucker. - A sucker? - Yes, a poor sod. - The miss told him off well! - Sweets? - No, I'd prefer a smoke. - A smoke? - A cigarette. - I've only got Caporals. - They're my favourites. - Francis is catching up. - Go on! You can do it! - After you. - Francis thrashed them all right. Didn't he just? I shouted too loud. I'm dying of thirst. - Let's go for a drink. - Can I buy you a round? - All right. - I know a bistro nearby. You do? - How's it going? - Not bad. Everything alright? Is the music still at Dede's? The machines? Yes, but he has Corsican troubles. They're taking over the neighbourhood. Things will settle down. - What will you have, Miss? - I don't know. A port or a strawberry cordial? It's very sweet. I'll have a mint cordial in a large glass. And you? - I'll have what she's having. - A strong Pernod. Two Pernods, one strong and one weak. - Four... - What are you counting? That's one of Dede's machines. They cough up on the ninth go. Five... - Are you a regular at the Buffalo? - No. My friend stood me up today. I'm glad he didn't show up or I wouldn't have met you. - Will you be here on Sunday? - If you will. No, on Sunday we go cycling. Don't we, Jo? Seven... Yes, we go to the countryside on Sundays. I've got a bicycle too. - At the risk of being forward... - Eight. I'll be right back. - My turn. - I haven't finished yet. - Give us a shot. - Later. Just one go and I'll leave you to it. Thank you. - Cheers, Miss... - Loulou. Loulou? That's a pretty name. - Mine's Marcel? - It is? - Cheers. - Did you win? One...two... You're not counting all night? It's no fun. If I don't count, I get muddled. Anyway, I won't be here all night. I'm meeting Little Louis. Three... - What for? - About a job. - What job? - A smash and grab. - Where? - I can't tell you in front of him. Four... Is it four or five? I've lost count now! He's hard to understand. Is he French? A La Villette thoroughbred. I'm from Barbes. - So he's talking slang. - You've got it in one. Dough means cash. Beat it means clear off. To bug means to bother. To blab means to shop. - To shop? - To grass. You translate slang I don't know into slang I do. How funny! - And what's a smash and grab? - I can't say. - Why? Is it a secret? - No. It's trade jargon. It doesn't interest you. From Jo's trade? What does he do? You're nosy. What would you say if I asked what you did? I'd say I was a jeweller. A jeweller? Have you got a shop? No, I'm an employee. All the same, it's an interesting job. Loulou. Waiter! Another round. Not for me. I'm not a big drinker. You're not going to chicken out now? Two strong Pernods. My turn. Hand over the cash! Jewellers are like bankers. They handle fortunes but they're not stuck up. Cheers, Miss Loulou. - Dine with me tonight. - I'm afraid I can't tonight. - Another time maybe. - Loulou. - I'm sorry. - That's all right. Go ahead. - When can I see you again? - I'm free most days. - How about Wednesday? - Fine. Then I'll take you out to dinner on Wednesday. - Where shall we meet? - At the Madrid at 7.30pm. Great... What's the slang for that? - Hunky-dory. - Hunky-dory! So it's a date, Wednesday? You're getting the hang of this. What if something comes up? Just phone Trudaine 25-34. - Trudaine 25-34? I'll remember. - They'll pass on a message. - Is that where you live? - No, it's a bistro I frequent. Cool. Hey, stop hogging it. My turn. No, it's my turn. They've seen through me. I've had it. Here, change these tokens for me. - Is that Loulou with you? - Yes. Who's the other guy? - Some sucker we met at Buffalo. Has Tintin dumped Loulou? We never see him any more. Tintin's been slammed for six months. He's in prison? I didn't know. It means I'm out of work and Loulou's on her own. She seems to be consoling herself. Loulou's as straight as they come. - Have you got plans for Marcel? - Mind your own business. - Is that why you buttonholed him? - One of us has to find work. I'm meeting Little Louis about a smash and grab, aren't I? Honestly! Hello? Yes? Right. - Charlot. - Who is it? Dede. - Well? - Is Little Louis here? - Gégène, got any cash on you? - Why? Dede's bringing a guy over for a game of dice. - Have you got any? - You bet. Wait while I have a word with Little Louis. Is Little Louis planning a break-in? Yes, on Rue Réaumur. - A jeweller's? - No, a furrier's. Little Louis wants to do it in broad daylight. Breaking a window in broad daylight won't be easy. - He says it's the only way. - It's all the rage nowadays. I'd be amazed if Jo got involved. I don't embark on anything lightly. This isn't my first break-in. I'm a professional. A break-in in broad daylight will cost more than it pays. It will get us 18 months in Nevers. So you're chickening out? It's not my department. I'm used to working with Tintin. Fine, we'll manage without you. - No hard feelings? - Of course not. - But keep your mouth shut. - Sure. Here, check my dice look the same as the ones in the pot, Jo. If he's not a professional you'll be OK. - Who is he? Did he say? - A farmer from Auxerre. That's all right. Take them back for now. We don't want him to see we've rigged them. - Do I serve him a glass? - No, a carafe. How can we swindle him with a glass? - Can I make suggestion? - What? Bring your dice over in the pot. You play for a while. Let me finish, will you? When I give you a sign come and fetch the dice saying you need them for a dice game on the bar. The guy suspects nothing. Then you start fleecing him. Don't forget to take your cup back. - Without that we've had it. - Bring the mat over. Why can't you just play on the table? You need a soft surface or you don't know where you are. Shall we play with the real ones for now? Yes, it's your turn. Hello. How's it going? - What can I get you? - A Byrrh cassis. - What about you? - I'll have the same. Gegene? - Hey, Gegene? - What about Gegene? - Will you be long? - Why? Because this gentleman is a dab hand at dice. How do you fancy a game? We're playing poker. Another time, perhaps. This gentleman is passing through. He's catching a train tonight. Can't you interrupt your game of poker? - How long have you got? - Just an hour. - Well? - I don't know. What do you think? Bring the dice. Let's see them. - They're fine, don't worry. - I'm not worried. You go first. - What's going on? - They're fleecing some guy. - How does Tintin like his palace? - Shut up. He yells at me for not taking him enough dough. Where does he expect me to get it? If you're too ashamed to go out with me, just tell me. Mr Marcel, I'm talking to you. I'm sorry. It's just such fiddly work. So you're refusing to accompany me to the opera? I told you, I've got a prior engagement. Why not go with Mr. Blin? Would it be rude to ask what you're doing? - I'm... dining with a friend. - What friend? A friend of mine. I've invited him out to dinner. Which reminds me, could I possibly have a small advance? It's the end of the month so I'm a bit tight. Tight? Broke, that is. You've been using some strange expressions lately. Yes, I'm sorry. What I mean is, I lack funds. 200 francs would allow me to balance my budget. - All right, then. I'll ask Daddy. - Thank you very much. But it's a bit much, spending 200 francs on a friend instead of coming to the opera. I'll end up thinking you're avoiding me, Mr Marcel. Oh, Miss. Me? Not at all. - You think I'm dangerous. - Not at all. But I cannot forget that I am your father's lowly employee. You are far too shy, Marcel. Set your sights higher. My father was once a lowly employee too. That didn't stop him marrying his boss's daughter. What do you say to that new allusion? I'm determined not to rise to it any more than the others. Why ever not? The boss's daughter isn't bad. She's not my type. I like brunettes. Is that all it is? No, I'm wary of Miss Renee, you understand. I'm thinking of my predecessor. She's basically just a tease. Not with you, of course, Mr. Blin. But she thinks everyone is after her for her dowry. I'm not stupid enough to risk it. I have a good job. I don't want to lose it. There's too much unemployment. What she doesn't know is that my friend is a girlfriend. Brunette, no doubt. You've guessed it, Mr. Blin. Is it her you've been trying to get hold of for two hours? Yes, it's a cafe. It's ringing. Hello? Trudaine 25-34, please. I'd like to speak to Miss Loulou. Loulou. Her name's Loulou. Pretty name, isn't it? Have you quite finished saying my name over and over? I hope you're not making fun of me. Oh, it's you, Marcel. Of course I haven't forgotten you. Let's meet at the restaurant. All right? What shall we do afterwards? We'll see. Yes, we'll see. Actually, I've got an idea. And two is the perfect number to put it into practice. Hello? I'm counting on you, my friend. Between 7.30 and 8pm. Thank you. Goodbye, my dear fellow. That was my friend confirming our date. I see your father has obliged. Yes, but I'm warning you, that phone wasn't installed for your private conversations. There. - Shall I bring you a clean napkin. - Of course. And don't forget the flowers. And remember: the utmost discretion and no joining in our conversation. - Don't worry, Mr Marcel. - Here she is now. Here she is. - Where's Loulou? - Paying the cab driver. - She's paying for the cab? - So? - And you accompanied her? - I've come for a bite to eat. - What? - I thought we were dining. Er... yes, yes. Charles? This gentleman is having a bite... He's dining with us so set another place for him. Loulou. - See? I came. - Yes, but with Jo. - Aren't you pleased? - I'd rather you were unescorted. - What? - I'd rather you were alone. No, say what you said before. Listen to this, Jo. - Go on. - I'd rather you were unescorted. - Did you hear that? - But it's French! Who are you trying to kid? We're not stupid. - Where are the bogs? - Back there. - I'll have a Byrrh cassis. - You're pissed enough as it is. And we'll be eating soon. Mr Marcel's guests have a strange look about them. Remove those flowers so we can see one another. What's up, baveau Mavargavel? - What? - Don't you speak Javanais? What did you learn at school? "I'd rather you were unescorted." That's what I learnt. Are you going to sulk all night? Is Jo getting on your wick? A bit. What exactly does he mean to you? - He's just a friend. - Really? He's not even my friend, he's my boyfriend's friend. Your...? I see. You could say they were partners. So you have a boyfriend? - Why, yes! - Of course you do. - You seem shocked. - I've only ever seen you with Jo. I never imagined you had someone else. I'm on my own just now so Jo's keeping me company. - Is your boyfriend away? - Yes, he's away. - Will he be away long? - You could say that. - How long? - Six months. Six months? How old is your boyfriend? - 30. - 30? I see. And... - Is he handsome? - I've seen uglier. Want to see his face? Here. - Congratulations. - You can't judge from a face. - You should see his torso. - What about it? His shoulders are like this. He's built like a brick shithouse. - Aren't you, Tintin? - So he's called Tintin? His real name is Auguste. I was suggesting we go to the cinema after dinner. How about the boxing at Central or the wrestling at Wagram? - Do you like boxing? - Don't you? I don't like the cinema. Too many gangster films. - Do they shock you? - No, but they're all sham. They break down the door with their shoulders. They knock guys out with one punch. They open safes in a jiffy. Real life's not like that. How do you know what it's like in real life? Do you know real-life gangsters? How thrilling. He's bluffing. Don't listen to him. Shut up, you idiot. Have you decided, sir? - Calf's head. - Have you finished insulting me? No, that's what we're having. Two calf's heads in oil. I'll have veal Marengo. Will you come to the cinema, then? - If you like. - What's on? - I don't know but who cares? I'll be beside you. That's the main thing. - Finished? - Yes, all done. So two calf's heads and one Marengo. And some knobs of butter to go with the bread. - Is that all? - A bottle of red. - We serve wine in carafes. - Give us a litre-carafe, then. No meal is complete without a litre of red. Light weight! Slow down, will you? There's no stopping him when the grub's free. - I didn't eat at lunchtime. - Because of Marcel's dinner. I'm only doing justice to your invitation. Only you weren't invited. Was he, Marcel? Well, I mean... I brought him to keep you company after dinner. - Aren't you staying with me? - I can't. A friend's mother is ill. I promised to cup her. Loulou is an expert at cupping. Aren't you, Loulou? And there was I thinking, hoping... Don't give up hope. Another time, I promise. Let's spend Sunday in the countryside. - And without a car. - But tonight is ruined. You can go to the cinema with Jo. It won't be the same. Really, Madam! Hey, is this yours? Yes, my shoes are a bit tight so I take them off when I'm sitting down. Here, take it. - Are you enjoying it? - What? - The film. - I haven't been watching. - We may as well leave, then. - Yes, let's. Please, Madam. Stop falling asleep on me. I can't find the other shoe. Here, I've got it. You can put it on at the exit. Excuse us. Tell me, Jo, do you think I have a chance with Loulou? Tintin's my mate. I refuse to be drawn on this. - But do I have a chance? - It's not my business. - See you Sunday. - Are you abandoning me? - I don't live round here. - Walk me back to my digs. Why? Do you like talking to me? No, but I get bored on my own. I'll come if you give me your opinion on Loulou. You make me laugh. What do you want me to say? The kid is home alone. Her bloke is away for five months. With a guy like you chatting her up, who knows if she'll stay faithful? She must have a soft spot for you or she wouldn't keep seeing you. That so? Thank you. I'll walk you home. Bonjour: bavonjavour. - Bonjour: bajour. - No. - Bavonjavour. It's quite simple. - Do you think so? Bavonjavour, le baveau Mavargavel. - But what does it mean? - Hello, handsome Marcel. That's Javanais. This is for you, Mr. Blin. And here's the brooch. - Any deliveries for me? - No. Is there a bill to pay? Yes, Mr. Blin. 850 francs. 850 francs... A new dress, no doubt. No, you're wrong. It's a surprise. - For you? - No. I know what it is. - For Mr. Mercandieu, then? - No. - For you. For me!? A surprise of 850 francs? - I can't accept it, Miss Renee. - I never said it was a gift. What could it be? Did you have fun last night? - They took me to the movies. - "They"? Another friend turned up unexpectedly. - It must have cost a pretty penny. - Especially with the second one. That guy was a right skinflint. You have picked up some strange expressions. Do you friends speak like that? They seem like strange folk. You shouldn't judge people on appearances. A Parisian talking in slang is like a peasant speaking dialect. There. You're so defensive. I'm not attacking them. You stayed at school until you were 18. Not everyone can do that. French is a difficult language. So is Javanais. That's true. What a strange comparison. Why would anyone learn Javanais? Coming from Provence, I found the Parisian accent hard to master. You haven't quite managed it yet. Do you think? What is your friends' social standing? Their social standing? Today they've gone to the races. - Are they gamblers? - No, they work at the exit. - Are they pedlars? - I don't know. Jo said he fleeces suckers with three card tricks. - What does that mean? - I don't know. It's trade jargon. - So one of them's called Jo? - Yes. - And the other one? - Loulou. - That's a woman's name. - Of course, because she's a woman. You look a right twerp with your umbrella under your arm. - It might come in handy. - You think it might rain? There's not a cloud in the sky. That's not what I was thinking of, pea brain. - Great. - Which one? Gadiche, a mare who's had first-class treatment. Gegene said to put all my money on her. She's a dead cert. He's been planning this for weeks. - The odds are 2021. - Are you betting on her? I didn't come to the races to pick strawberries. - Are you sure she'll win? - It's in the bag. Put 30 francs on her for me. It's for Tintin. Gadiche! Gadiche is off. She'll win hands down. - She's making a run for it. - Go for it, Gadiche! With a name like that, I should have been wary. - Poor Tintin. - We'll get his dosh back. What with? With the stupid umbrella you were making fun of earlier. It's just as well I brought it along with my cards. Where is it? Where is it? Bets over here! Here we go, place your bets Come forward. I hide it, you find it. Ace of spades wins, red suits lose. Follow the game. - Where is it, gentlemen? - There. How much? 10 francs? 20? 50? Easy! 10 francs. Here you go. - You win. - Thanks. Where is it, gentlemen? - There. 10 francs. - 20. - Me too. - 30 francs. Any advance? You win. You're lucky. Where is it, gentlemen? - There. 30 francs. - 50. It's yours. - I thought it was there. - Who'd have thought? - Where are you off to? - I'm in a rush. You're all the same! Come and bet your winnings. Come on, gentlemen. Where is it? There. 50 francs. That's incredible. I was convinced it was there. Where is it, gentlemen? Whoever finds the ace of spades wins. Where is it, ladies and gentlemen? - There. 100 francs. - 200. - 250. - 500. - 500. - Show me the cash. I don't trust you. Come on, show me the money. Did you see that? She bet 500 without a penny to her name! - Well? - I'm sticking to 500. - Sure? - Sure. - Hand over the cash. - This is theft. Then why play? - You lost so you must pay up. - You should be honest. Watch out, the cops are here! 600, 700, 800 and 50. And 40 centimes for you. - Thanks. Goodbye, all. - Goodbye. She was so insistent, I couldn't refuse. Is this the surprise? Yes, now I can come with you on Sunday. But I've promised to go out with friends on Sunday. - You can introduce me. - I'm not sure a girl like you... Nonsense. It will be delightful. They can chaperone you. I wouldn't mind meeting this Mr. Jo and Miss Loulou. Yes. - Come on, hurry up. - Wait for me. You should have practised. You're slowing everyone down. Your friends could pedal slower, if only out of politeness. - I did warn you. - They're the worst sort. Listen, I didn't force you to come. Are you saying I imposed myself on you? Come on, pedal. Stop. The kid has run out of steam again. - Talk about pea-brained! - Have you quite finished? And what kind of man is he? Did you hear him talk to the cops? "I'm sorry, Officer. I didn't see the sign." What a twerp. And that girl is mighty clingy. - Why doesn't he dump her? - He doesn't want to lose his job. Here they come. Let's go. - Where are we heading? - We're having lunch in Poissy. Says who? - Me. Why not Rouen or Cherbourg while we're at it? You're right, but I didn't want to push the young lady. Are you saying I can't ride a bike? No, just that you don't pedal fast enough. Whereas Miss Loulou does? That's a fact. Come on, pedal. - It's scandalous. - Not this again. We've been cycling for an hour. Look at Marcel. He still looks fresh as a daisy. Well, almost. - So, what are we doing? - Jo's bushed. - Bushed? - Done in. Must I explain everything? - So we're not going to Poissy? - You go to Poissy if you fancy. - It's not really our scene. - I don't want to force anyone. I'm sure your boyfriend will be happy to oblige. - I hardly think so. - That will do, Jo. It was her idea to go to Poissy. That will do, I said. We'll stay here and be done with it. Seeing as it's decided, we'll go along with it. - I think it's lovely here. - Where shall we have lunch? We'll go and buy something and eat it here on the grass. If you don't mind, I'd rather sit at a table. Fine. What shall we do after lunch? I'm for lying in the grass and having 40 winks. We could have gone out in a boat in Poissy. She's some girl. - What did you say? - Nothing. You're making me feel unwelcome. - I can go if you like. - Come, now! It's true. You're treating me like dirt. Oh, stop your blubbering. We'll go to Poissy if it means so much to you. Shut up, you. I hate seeing girls cry. I can't help it. We said we'd stay here. Leave if you don't like it. - At least I know where I stand. - Typical! I forbid you to follow me. I want to go alone. - Your father entrusted you to me. - What was he thinking? Had he met your friends... - That will do! - Be polite. - I am polite. - I'm not used to your tone. I was wrong to treat you as a friend... ...rather than just an employee. - What's done is done. - I'll never forget this day. Listen, can't we forget all this and have a nice time? - Forget it? - Or at least pretend. Let's stop squabbling. We don't get many Sundays. That's true. We don't get enough of them. That's enough now. I don't like arguing. It upsets me. What time is your lunch? - Feeling peckish? - What? - Are you hungry? - No. Getting up early spoils my appetite. Marcel, have I got a creepy-crawly on my neck? Hang on. There, under my blouse. I can't see anything. There it is. I've got it now. Don't move. There. You can't still feel it, can you? Thank you. You're not wearing a bra. Have you got a hanky for my head? A handkerchief? Of course. Here. Aren't you going to lie down? I'd like to but I don't have a handkerchief to put under my head. - Here. - I don't want to deprive you. - Go ahead. I don't need it. - How kind of you. Thank you. But I want it back. It was a present. Don't worry. I'll give it back. What about yours, Marcel? Was it a present too? No, I bought it. Can I keep it, then? - If you like. - Thank you. Don't mention it. When are we having lunch, then? All she thinks about is food. Show me your biceps. Not bad. What about mine? And feel this. Strong, aren't they? My belly's the same. Feel it. It's not pork chops. It's good quality. Top-notch. Mr Jo! Mr Jo! - What do you want from him? - I want him to feel my biceps too. Did you hear that, Jo? You're a hit with the young lady. Mr Jo! He's asleep, the lazy bones. Hey, Jo! Watch out! Here come the cops! That was mean. I was having a nice quiet nap. Shame on you for snoozing and not chatting up the nice lady. - That was nice. - Are you ticklish? Are you? I'm only ticklish in one spot. - It drives me wild. - It does? - Where is it? - Find it and you'll see. - Here? - No. - Here? - No. It's her knockers that's sensitive. Her knockers? What's knockers? Tits, knockers, jugs. I have to explain everything to him. - Is that true? - Yes. - Shall I try? - Later when we're alone. I get it. They make me sick, Mr Jo. Your boobs are a bit of all right too. Oh, Mr Jo! You're a shapely girl, and I should know. - Don't worry. - You're too kind. Do you like breeches on a woman? - Breeches? - I find them dreadfully common. - Don't you agree? - That depends. It depends on your figure. Of course, if you're a bit plump it's a way of hiding it. Precisely. I don't know if you agree with me, but to my mind there's nothing more ridiculous than a woman trying to look like a man. Did you hear that, Jo? Let's go and have a quiet drink. I'll pay. You're a good sport. Come on. - See you. - Where are you off to? To down a jar. I'm parched. - Find us a nice bistro for lunch. - Aye-aye, captain. - Can I come too, Mr Jo? - Yes, come on. I'll feel like a gooseberry if I stay here. That's nonsense, eh, Marcel? - Come off it, Renee... - Please. I'll have the last laugh, you'll see. Do you mind going up front? I'm done in. All right. Let's go. - Clingy, isn't she? - Tell me about it. I knew she'd be trouble, and the day's not over yet. - Is she always like that? - Pretty much. When I saw the bike in the office I thought my number was up. Sunday was my one free day but not any longer. - Perhaps she wants to marry you. - You must be joking. If she's harassing you, why not resign? Because of the recession. I can't be certain of a job elsewhere. - How much do you earn? - 1800. - That's not much. - Mr Mercandieu is tight-fisted. He's a skinflint. - Is business slow? - It's like everywhere else. - They have very few overheads. - How many staff? There's me. An accountant who comes in three times a week and three in the workshop. Is it a nice shop? It's not a shop, it's a flat. It's a flat? - Yes, on Rue Turbigot. - What number? - 48. - 48? It's too hot. Let's stop here. Landlord? Are you there? So... What will you have? I insist on paying my share, Mr Jo. Who do you take me for? My round is my round. - You can buy the next round. - I'd like that. - Or we can play dice for it. - Good day. - Can we eat here? - Of course. We'll see about that later. Bring us two Byrrh cassis and some dice. Yes - I don't know how to play. - I'll teach you. It's easy. - Is that thing real? - I think so. Watch you don't lose that out here in the countryside. There's no risk of that. I'm careful with it. And the cloth. - Do you know the grass game? - No, what is it? Catch the other end. Not with your hands, silly. Like this. - Whoever eats the most wins. - But our mouths will touch. - Does that worry you? - No. One, two, three, go! - You sprinted into the lead there. - Again? - Did you enjoy that? - Yes. But the winner should win something. - What? - Whatever you like. - A small favour. - This could get out of hand. - I'm bound to win. - Let's do it. Ready? One, two, three, go! There. You're so lucky. You can catch up this afternoon. How much do I owe you? Bah. I insist. There. Here's 50 francs. I still owe you 10 francs. - Let's go and fetch the others. - I wonder what they're up to. A pretty girl like you needn't be jealous. You're a flatterer, Mr Jo. Shift that pretty arse of yours. You're so funny! Get lunch ready, will you? We'll be back. Don't worry. Marcel has a soft spot for you. - Do you think so? - I know so. Go on I'll never win one. One, two, three, go. - Let go or I'll slap you. - I won and I want my prize. - What if your boss's daughter sees? I am seeing it. Charming, Mr Marcel. Charming. We were playing the grass game. A real parlour game. - Do you want to play with Marcel? - No, thanks. - Let's eat. I'm famished. - He's right. Let's eat. - About time. - Did you see what was on the menu? Radishes, omelette and veal with sorrel. - Will that do you? - I don't like sorrel. Your loss. Leave me alone. I forbid you to touch me. Fine. There's trouble brewing. - Do you know where Marcel works? - No. 48 Rue Turbigot, third floor. Renee lives there with her dad who's a widower. - So what? - What do you think? I forbid you to speak to me. Fine. And I suggest you change your tone. Me? - Don't mock me. - But... Quiet. We're no longer friends. Had you forgotten they were jewellers? Come on, let's go. Marcel! Stop, Marcel! Stop, Marcel. I've lost my brooch. I thought we weren't speaking. This is no time to joke. - I've lost my brooch. - Where? Don't ask stupid questions. If I knew, I wouldn't have asked. On the way back from the restaurant. - Great! - Just look for it, will you? - What's wrong? - Miss Renee has lost her brooch. What did I tell you, Miss Renee? The countryside's no place for things like that. I should have listened to you and had you safekeep it. - Look for it, will you? - So it's my fault now, is it? Was it valuable? Sorry... I should say so. Sorry. I didn't notice that she wearing a brooch. I did. It's the stupidest thing. Look. You devil! We don't sack people who have done nothing wrong, at least not at work. So you don't mind your staff being rude to your daughter? I'm just saying it's not a good enough reason to sack him. He's 20 minutes late. Sack him for that. He's normally on time. It's a poor excuse. So you insist on keeping him? Say so right now. - Then I'll go instead. - Don't be stupid. Wait a week. If you still feel the same way, I'll sack him. - Take time to reflect. - I've made up my mind. If you'd met Mr Marcel's friends, I assure you, you wouldn't want to keep him on. This must be him now. - You're late, Mr Marcel. - Forgive me. It wasn't my fault. - The metro broke down. - What a coincidence. Just don't let it happen again. Otherwise... - Coming to tonight's meeting? - What meeting? For former members of the 131th regiment. - No, it's not my scene. - Your loss. Apparently after dinner there's a slide show on lndo-China. - It will be very interesting. - I'd rather go to bed. As you wish. - I'm going up to the workshop. - Right you are, sir. Well, Miss Renee? Did you sleep well after a day of cycling? - Not too stiff? - Listen, Mr Marcel. I'll thank you to limit your dealings with me to matters of professional nature. Certainly, Miss. Take this order up to the workshop and check it's correct. Very well. - Morning, all. - Ah, it's dear Mr Blin. Was your bus late? My metro was. Mind your own business, Mr Marcel. So, how was your outing? I should have gone to the theatre with you. I would have had a better afternoon. - You know... - Oh, yes. At least you would have had the tact not to expose me to such unsavoury characters. By the way, what are you doing tonight? - Tonight? - I'm inviting you to dinner. - But... - I insist. Daddy will be out at a meeting. We'll have dinner and then we'll go to the opera. - I'd love to. - I'll let Daddy know. Right. - Is something wrong? - I'm in disgrace. But you have no idea how little I care. I don't give a toss. I couldn't care two hoots. Hello. Where's Little Louis? - Working. - Is today his break-in? I wish I could fast-forward two hours. - Did they find a car to nick? - Yes, Charlot helped them out. Don't worry. I'm not worrying. All that's at stake for you is the money. For me it's my man. - Where's Loulou? - At the prison. She visits Tintin every Monday. - Mr Blin? - Miss? Do you know what knockers are? - knockers? - Yes. No, Miss. Your education is incomplete, Mr Blin. Women's breasts are called knockers in some circles. And very distinguished circles they are too. Mr Marcel has some good friends in that world. The men lead a life of contemplation whereas the women are very active. They love going out at night, preferably to dimly lit places. Most of them have pretty names, very poetic names, like Casque d'or, Grande Millie, Loulou. You've gone too far this time. - What's wrong? - How dare you insult the woman... The woman you love? I'm just your employee. You said so yourself. I don't owe you an explanation. Don't talk to me in that tone of voice. Then respect my friends. - Your girlfriend, you mean. Miss Loulou is a respectable girl. - As is Mr Jo, right? - Absolutely. I won't have my friends insulted, or even my friends' friends. Honestly! Stop, thief! Stop, thief! - Where to? - Boulevard Barbes. We'll take a cab to Chez Fernand. Drive to the scrapyard and leave the car there. Careful you're not spotted. Meet Fefe as agreed. Pity we can't keep the car. It drives so well. I'd love to take my girl for a drive. In a position of trust such as this... - Trust! - Indeed. - ...some company is unacceptable. - You've decided to sack me. Just go ahead, the sooner the better. Indeed, when I told my father about your conduct, - he wanted to sack you. - There you go. I asked him to wait to give you time to think. - About what? - Your future. - You're sacrificing it. - Let's talk about my future. 1800 francs a month with a 100 franc annual rise. - Mr Blin? - Miss? - Leave us for a moment, please. - Certainly. My father is getting on a bit. He's thinking of retiring. You could take over from him. I can't afford to buy his business and he's unlikely to give it to me. He could start by giving shares, and making you a partner before handing me over. Handing you over? - Why not? - Come off it, Miss Renee. - Now you're teasing me. - Ask Daddy and you'll see. You just said he wanted to sack me. Only if you carry on seeing those people. - You must choose. - Is this an ultimatum? No, a dilemma: on the one hand a brilliant career, a situation beyond your wildest dreams. On the other hand, a sordid affair and financial ruin. On the one hand the brunette and on the other the blonde. If you like. I'll think about it. Mr Blin. - You can come back in. - I'm not interrupting anything? It's hard to work when you're arguing. We've finished. Well? - I'm thinking about it. - What? I'm weighing up the pros and cons. Brunette. Blonde. Brunette. You said you'd have 500,000 francs for me. - You're taking the piss. - I'm doing my best. I'll give you what for when I get out of here. Mark my word. I'll teach you to defy me. I owe 300 at the canteen. Do you hear? The boss says my credit's run out. Do you want me to eat prison food? Of course not, Tintin. The lawyer's secretary sent a note demanding money. What an ass! Do me a favour and send a grand and a half. 1500 francs? Yes, 1500 francs. They can get my sentence reduced on the spot if I pay up. 1500 francs. Where do you expect me to get that? I don't care. Jo will help you. Jo is too lazy. There's no way he'll work. Tell him I'll punch his lights out when I get out. All right. Got that? A grand and a half for the lawyer. 500 here for my extras. That makes 2,000. Now get out of here. Say something nice to me. Tell your Loulou you love her. My Loulou will have her comeuppance when I get out of jail. Don't bother coming back here empty-handed. I won't be here for you. See you. - What can I get you? - Give me a brandy. - What happened to your hand? - It was when I broke the glass. I don't know what they stick on it but it sure is hard to break. - I'll bandage it up. - It's fine. - Come on. - I said it's fine. There's iodine tincture in the kitchen. What time's your Pole coming for the loot? This afternoon at three. - Did it go OK? - As you can see. I should have gone. - OK? - Yes. Go and get Popol and bring him back here. I've given it some thought, Miss Renee. - Shall I leave the room? - I'm giving up... No, stay, Mr Blin. Your brilliant career and situation beyond my wildest dreams I mean. - What? - I've chosen the brunette. I think you'd better leave. I think so too. Do you know what your decision means? It means I must find another job. Even if you find one, they'll want a reference. And? After what I have to say, they'll never hire you. I'm prepared for the worst. Please. And all that for a streetwalker. What did you say? - You heard. - Take it back. - Take it back at once. - I mean it. - So you won't take it back? - No. Right. - Where are you going? - I'm leaving. Where are you going? I'm warning you. If you leave, you can't come back. I'm counting on it. Think about it? - Again? My mind's made up. Goodbye Excuse me, Mr Blin. - Please get up, Mr Blin. - Forgive me. Run after him. I have something very important to tell him. Yes Miss. Are you behind every door now? I thought I told you never to come back. Mr Blin, ask Mr Mercandieu to give you my pay. I'll come to your house to collect it. - It will save me coming back here. - Marcel... - Goodbye, Mr Blin. - Goodbye. Listen to me, Marcel. - I want a word with you. - Can't you see I'm busy? Come with me. - I'm on edge. - Because? It's Tintin. He's mad. He needs lolly to pay his lawyer. - Hasn't he paid him yet? - What with? Not with what you send him. That's not all. He's had his credit cut off. No dough, no grub. - So? - We need to find some dough. There's Renee's brooch. We'll sell it. It's not enough. We need a couple of grand at least. - So what's your plan? - To rob Marcel's boss. - Are you mad? - No. - A simple break-in? - Absolutely. And who's going to do your break-in? - You. - You must be joking. No, I'm not joking. It's time to show you're a man. You don't expect me to do a break-in on my own? I'll keep a lookout. You do it and I'll keep a lookout. You're having a laugh. So you won't do it? - I don't fancy it. - What kind of a man are you? You can be a man and still value your life. All right, let's drop the subject. Jewelers don't store their stuff in the larder. It will be in a safe. So? You've broken safes before. Just use a blowtorch. Why not send me to rob the Bank of France while you're at it. So you're chickening out? I'm not chickening out. I'm just saying I'm not cut out for break-ins. - Have you never done one before? - It's not the same with Tintin. Why don't you ask Little Louis. He's the expert. - It's no skin off his nose. - He doesn't need the cash, I do. Very funny. He does the job and you split the loot. It makes perfect sense. Shall I ask him? No. Hello? It's for you, Loulou. - Hello. - He won't need the address. - What's the risk? - Hello! It's you, Marcel. Of course I haven't forgotten you. Would you be interested in robbing a jewelers? - What sort? - It's in a flat. Not the best sort. What else? We know a member of staff. That's more interesting. Is he in on it? No, but he's got it coming to him. He's thick as two short planks. She said some unforgivable things so I left. I'd rather not repeat them. You'll never guess. It was unbelievable. Loulou, I want to see you and talk to you. I only feel confident when I'm with you. I think so, yes. Where are you? Yes, I'll come. Loulou... I'll do it in a month. - Can't you do it any sooner? - No. The air in Paris is bad for me. I'm off to the country tomorrow. - Doctors' orders. - You'll have to do it. - So there's no way out. - There's a snag. - Marcel's left his job. - No! Yes. - Where's Popol? - He's been arrested. To Barbes, at Fernand's. - You should leave. - If he talked, he'll retract it. And you can vouch for me being here. - Will they swallow it? - They'll have to - What about your hand? - Damn. You're right. I must scram. Give her the key to the stash. Talk to the fence and don't let him swindle you. - This is bad. - What is? The cops are here. There's a taxi and a van. No expenses spared. No wonder our taxes are going up. - Hand it over quick. - Why? I don't want things kicking off in here again. You're right, their is too many. Don't let them get drunk. Don't just stand there. Sit down. Anyone would think you'd never seen cops before. You're hillarious. Your cafe's a prison with no back door to escape through. I don't like this. It gets me down. Do you want a pick-me-up? - What are they waiting for? - Me to leave. They prefer to catch you outside. It's less fuss. If they're in no hurry then neither am I. Sorry sirs, I'm looking for Cafe Fernand. - What for? - I'm meeting someone. - Right. - Thanks. Hold up. What do you think you're doing? - Let him go. - Honestly! Christ. Watch out, someone's coming. Evening. Excuse me but is this Fernand's? Do your job and stop messing us around. - I'm not messing anyone around. - Hey, over here! - This is the guy I mentioned. - Oh, right. Come over here. - Great timing! - Oh, I didn't see you. - How are you? - I've been better. It's so good to see you. - I needed that. - Yeah? So this is where you come every evening. Yes It's nice and quiet. There are times when it's livelier. - You've come on a bad day. - I prefer quiet places. - I hate noise. - Then you're in luck. Yes. It's surprising, this quiet cafe on such a dodgy street. - Do you think so? - You don't mind me saying that? - Carry on. - You know, I met two odd-looking chaps outside. I wouldn't like to bump into them in a wood at midnight in the moonlight. But I didn't come here to tell you that. - This is taking a while. - We're in no rush. Eh, Fefe? So you're unemployed now? - So it would seem. - What will you do? I don't know. I saw two friends who work in the jewellery business but they're laying people off. So? I don't know. Tell me, your boyfriend Tintin and Jo are partners. - Couldn't they hire me? - No. I won't be demanding. It's not that. The business they're in wouldn't suit you. I don't have fixed ideas. The job at the jeweler's just came along. But I can do other things. I'm very adaptable. It's not a business for you. What about their acquaintances? Anything doing? You'd do better to look elsewhere. Don't think I don't want to help you. One of these days you'll understand why I can't. - Here they come. - What is it? Police. Hands up. No one move. Now do you see? - Didn't you hear? - What? - I said, didn't you hear? - Hear what? Hands up, yours too. - As you wish. - Don't push your luck. - I'm not... - Shut your face! - Faster, Arab. - What did you call me? - Arab. Do you object? What a brute! Who said that? - I did. - You again. - It just slipped out. - Your papers. Of course. - Oh dear. - Hurry up. I can't find my wallet. I'm sure I had it earlier. Will you hurry up? I don't get it. I must have lost it. You're coming with me. Leave him. He wasn't thinking. - Who asked you? - Be polite to the lady. - What? Come with me. - Let go of me! - Come on. - You can't arrest me. - Get a move on. - I want to make a call. Don't push me like that. First I get yelled at in the cafe and now this. It was him. Where did he spring from? He's an oddball. - What will happen to him? - I feel sick. Who stole his wallet? - Me. I did it without thinking. - Go and give it back to him. Why should I put myself out for that idiot? Just do it. Tell him we found it under a table after they'd left. - I don't know where they took him. - Go and look for him, and hurry. Your Marcel is a pain in the neck. He's caused us nothing but trouble. - Is he a friend of yours? - Yes. That's strange. You can come in. Thank you, Inspector. - Oh, you found it! - As you can see. Thank you. That's lucky. Without it they would have kept me here. - We'll get your things. - Where was it? - What? - My wallet. It had fallen on the ground. I picked it up after you'd left. - It's kind of you to come by. - It's only natural. Plenty of people would have waited. Loulou made me run after you. I don't much like these places. Well, that was very kind of Loulou. Very kind indeed. Can I go? Thank you, Inspector. I'll be seeing you. - Just say goodbye. - Right. Goodbye, gentlemen. - And thank you once again. - Oh, come on, you! - You're a prize idiot! - Why? Thanking the cops who nabbed you! - It wasn't them. - They're all the same. - How do you feel? - Stiff. - A drink will perk you up. - I'd like that. Come in. - Who is it? - Marcel. He's come for lunch. So they let you both out? Sit down. - I can't. - Why not? I'm... a bit sore. - Did they knock you around? - A bit, yes. Try anyway- Don't move. - Give me your jacket to mend. - There's no need. Come on, let me help you. - Give him a drink, Jo. - Red wine or brandy? - There is no brandy. - I bought some on the way up. - You've been conversing with it. - I had to check it was good stuff. Here, Marcel. Knock this back. It's good for dark thoughts. - Want some? - What do you think? Cheers. - What do you think? - It's good. The cops put him in the picture, you know. Yes, I know you're burglars. Housebreakers. When are you going to talk like the rest of us? Look at me. Your eyes are shining. You're drunk. Drunk on three glasses? We only drank to ease the pain. - A bit of red wine, Mr Jo? - Yes. - Cheers. - Cheers. - It's good. - Where am I meant to sit? Go and fetch a chair from your room. Have you seen how she treats me? - What did the cops say about me? - I'm sure you can guess. - Did they mention Tintin? - Yes, Tintin, and you. - Me? - Yes. Your occupations, your past history, your profession. Don't drink so much. I have to drink to forget, because a situation such as this... takes its toll on a man. In two days you won't feel a thing. I'm not talking about that. I mean the morale pain. You're funny, and deluded. I don't stand to inherit and I've got Tintin to feed too. Doesn't he get fed where he is? I can't let my man eat prison grub. It's not right. You could always work. - I do work. - I mean... in a more honest profession. This is all I know. No one else will take me on. I'm sorry. - Here's your jacket. - Thank you. You're back, I see. Let's eat. Eat without me. I'm not hungry. - What did the cops say about him? - Not much. They called him Idle Jo because he won't exert himself. Your reputation's even reached the cop shop now. I don't care what the cops think. Don't you mind eating with crooks? It's terrible. I had such a high opinion of you. Have a brandy and it will pass. - Cheers, Marcel. - Cheers, Jo. And have a bite to eat. - I prefer ham. - Have some ham, then. I'll never forget what you did, Jo. It was nothing. You may be thieves but I know honest folk who wouldn't have done what you did. There's no such thing as honest folk. I'll prove it to you. Shut up, Jo. You're drunk. So now you want to stop me talking? At least let him explain himself. You see? He understands me. You're a mate. I didn't like you much before but that all changed today. - We're friends, aren't we, Marcel? - Yes, Jo. - Let's drop the formalities. - All right. - Pass me your glass. - No, I've had too much to drink. Let's drink a toast. Jo... - Cheers. - Cheers. What was I saying? That there's no such thing as honest folk. That's right. Do you know any honest folk? - I think so. - Try to name one, then. Not Mercandieu for sure. He's the biggest scoundrel of them all. You see? What about you? Are you honest? I think so, yes. Have you never travelled first class with a second class ticket? - Eh? - Only when it's crowded. - Have you got a radio at home? - Yes. Have you declared it? I hardly ever use it. Right, that does it. You're a thief. We're all thieves. We're all guilty of robbing our neighbors or the government. All of us. All of us? Only us real robbers, we do it openly because it's our profession. Everyone else is scared to get dirty... so they do other jobs as a cover-up. But we do the least harm because we never steal from anyone we know. How can you say that? I see what you're getting at. Do you know why she said that? No. I'm going to tell Marcel. You're even more drunk than I thought. I may be drunk but he's my friend, right? Yes, Jo. - And you tell friends the truth. - That's right. The truth and nothing but the truth. Your wallet earlier. - It was me who pinched it. - No! My wallet? You stole my wallet? You, Jo? I admit I shouldn't have done it, especially at a time like that. But I should point out that you weren't my friend then. That makes a difference. What you did was wrong, Jo. I know it was wrong. - Do you want me to apologize? - No. No, I don't want you to apologize. I want to go. I just want to go. Goodbye, Jo. Goodbye. Don't leave like that. I said I was sorry. Do you want me to go down on bended knee? - No, I don't want that. - What do you want, then? - I want to go. - No. - Yes. - I don't want you to go. Well, I want to go. If the cops see you, you'll end up down the station. So what? I can't sink much lower. Here, wipe your face with this. - You too. - What for? - Because you're drunk. - I'm not drunk. Don't start crying. I can't help it. - Does drinks often do this to you? - Not always. I see. - Don't cry. - Leave him alone. If he cries, I'll cry too. I know myself too well. Then have a good cry, both of you. You can call me when you're done. What are you thinking about? Renee's face if she were to see you in this state. First, I'd be amazed if she dropped by. I could always call her. - Where? - At her flat. She isn't there. - She's gone to the opera. - So there's no one at home? - No one. - Liar. Try phoning... Turbigot... Turbigot 66... 14, seven times two. Turbigot 66-14? Seven times two. You'll be going down three flights of stairs for nothing. Sing me a song, Marcel. I don't feel well. I need some fresh air. Fresh air. Where are you going? It's not there. That's not the window. This is the window. Hey, Marcel! Are you OK there? Do you want a chair? No, thanks. It must be the ham that's made you feel sick. It might be the red wine. That's crazy. The red wine is the best. The best. I shouldn't have drunk brandy. Brandy? No, it was the cheese. No, no. Maybe it was the pastis we drank on our way here. Don't be stupid. Pastis is good for you. And we only drank two rums first. Then it must be the two rums. What's up? He feels squiffy so I'm taking him some cologne. You idiot! Hey. - You were right. No answer. - I knew it. - They might come back. - Not before midnight. - Well? - What? - Don't you see? - What? Just as I thought. We're going. Where? - Where? - Rue Turbigot, you idiot. You're kidding. Now's our chance. Don't you see? Two hours before they get back. It's as if God was looking out for us. What's happening to me? Get a move on. This is no time to feel ill. Another time if you like. I swear I don't feel well tonight. We'll borrow tools from Julot and a blowtorch from the Italian. Listen, Loulou, another time if you like. If I hadn't drunk all this brandy I'd be happy to oblige. If you chicken out it's not me you'll have to answer to. - It's Tintin. Do you understand? - What about him? Don't worry about him. How are you feeling? Better. What would you say to a little nap while Jo and I go out? - Are you going out? - We'll be back in two hours. - Then I'll be off home. - It's better if you wait here. Why? Don't you want to relax on my bed and wait? It's just that... In two hours I'll come and lie down too. And I can stay lying down with you? Don't believe her. We're off to do a break-in. A break-in? Yes, a burglary. - Is that true? - Can't you keep your trap shut? - Yes, it's true. - It's not Mercandieu, is it? No! - Jo's nodding. - Very clever! He's my friend. You don't double-cross a friend. You chicken. You're just hoping he'll make me change my mind. Lie down on my bed and let me tie you up. - Jo, bring the rope. - What? That way if the police come, they'll see you weren't involved. - You can't do that. - Watch me. Lie down! - Never. - Don't make me force you. - I might hurt you. - I won't let you tie me up. - But it's in your own interest. - I don't care. You can't burgle Mercandieu. If you need money I'll lend you some tomorrow. What good will this break-in do? Don't lecture me. You're right, Marcel. This is no good. - Fetch me the rope. - He doesn't want it. Go on or I'll smash this bottle in your face. That woman has a heart of stone. Do you hear me, Marcel? A heart of stone. - So you won't let me do this? - Ditch the idea of this break-in. - All right. - Bravo. I assure you, it was a bad idea. You're young. You can start over. - Have you seen Resurrection? - No. - What is it? - A film. A great film. I'm boring you. No, carry on. It's the story of a girl who has lost her way and is rescued by a young prince. - Did she fall? - Yes, she fell to a great depth. Love saved her. Obviously I am not a prince but I feel the courage to change your life. You will experience honesty. - And moral standards. - Poor Marcel! - Did you hit him? - Hurry. I want him tied up by the time he comes round. He's my friend. I refuse. - Shall I do the same to you? - Yes. You'd love that. Then you could avoid the break-in. Come on, hurry up. The clock's ticking. Have you got Tintin's rubber gloves? How am I supposed to know where he keeps them? - In the chest of drawers. - Right. He's coming round. How are you feeling? Are you all right? Do you want me to fetch you my bolster? I'm sorry but I had no choice. You wouldn't have let me go. Clear off. Poor Marcel. We've treated you badly. - You're cross with me, aren't you? - Yes. Listen... if all goes well there, if you're good and you stay here when I come back we'll see about rewarding you. All right? Got the gloves? Right, let's go. See you later, old chap. Let's hope it's not farewell. Get a move on! Be careful. I made sure I didn't tie your wrists too tight. Don't tell Loulou. I said, get a move on! If we get nabbed, will you visit me in prison? Will you really? Of course he'll visit you. He'll bring you cakes. - Now move it. - Shut up, vampire. Be good and you'll be rewarded. Come now, Miss Renee. Don't get so upset. She was only acting. It's not that. I didn't even hear her. - But she was singing quite loudly. - Quiet! Don't you want to know how it ends? - What a pity you're going. - Why? The third act is the real tearjerker. Are you still thinking about Mr Marcel? I'm sorry, Mr Blin. I can't help it. You stay. I can go home alone. No, I'll see you home. Poor Mr Blin. I've ruined your evening. Oh, you know, I'm not that fussed about singing. I prefer the Palais-Royal. - Tip. - I'm sorry. A simple oversight. - Forgive me. - Thank you. Tell Mr Marcel to come for his pay. I want to talk to him. Say I was crying and I regret what happened. Yes, yes, yes. Tell me, Mr Blin, where do you think he is? Who knows. - I bet he's in that woman's arms. - Oh, no, no. No, listen, Miss... - Can you manage it? - It takes time. It's already quarter to ten. - What do you want me to do? - Just do me a favor and hurry up. Shine the torch on me, not the walls. You're always moaning. Whatever I do, you're never happy. - I let you walk all over me. - Come on! A break-in under these conditions! It's sheer madness. - Are you scared? - No, but it's making me edgy. What sort of a gangster are you? - Is it working? - I need to check the pressure. I suspected as much. It's empty. It's open but nothing's coming out. It should whistle like crazy. Didn't you ask if the canister was full? He said he'd only used it once for ten minutes. How come it's empty then? How come it's empty then? Didn't you hear the kids crying when we left? "Mummy, they're taking our train." They used it as a train's whistle, no doubt about it. - You reckon? - I'm telling you. It's always the same with Italians. No wonder. They've got a room full of brats. So what do we do? We clear off and come back another time. We can't just leave. It's a good lesson for you to learn. A break-in takes planning. It's not a five-minute job. I need time to think. You piss me off. You open it, then, seeing as you're so clever. - Don't hurt me. - We won't if you stay calm. Walk towards us. - I want to sit down. - Jo, give her the chair. I can't. I'm sitting on it. - Then find her another one. - I don't feel well. What are you like! - What are you doing here? - Knitting. - How did you get in? - Through the door. We had a key that fit. We were lucky. - Have you got the safe key? - No. - Hand it over. - I swear I don't have it. - My father has it and he's out. - Is everything in the safe? - It's all in there. - What about the money? That too. Anyway, it's all gone. There's only 2,000 left, 3,000 at most. Just when I needed it. Goodbye, Miss, and sorry. Come on. Was it Marcel who tipped you off about this place? Him? Good Lord, no. We had to knock him out. - That's awful. Why? - He didn't want us to come. He was lecturing me. Can you imagine? Don't worry. We'll take care of him. He's fine. So he went to see you? Who else? You threw him out. That's not true. He just left. It was your fault. You bewitched him. And I'm sure you don't love him. You just used him to come and burgle us. - I can't lie to you. - Where is he now? On my bed, tied up like a sausage. It's me, Marcel. Open the door. Keep your voice down. There are neighbors. - Am I too late? - You took your time. - You tied my wrists too tight. - I thought I was careful not to. Not you again. You always turn up where you're not needed. Where's the safe key? There's only one safe key. Mr Mercandieu has it. - You see? - We're out of luck, then. - Weren't you going out? - I came home early. - Good night. - Are you going? You bet. I suggest you keep your trap shut. The cops will only come after your beloved Marcel. Marcel is not my beloved, or my employee. Change the record, will you? - It doesn't ring true. - He's come from your place. - You should be pleased. - I mean it. Had he stayed put I'd have rewarded him. He chose to come here instead. I wish I could be sure Marcel was honest. If he's so honest, what's he doing with us? When I met you I didn't realise what you were like. You can be so stupid sometimes. It was obvious they were criminals. That's not a nice thing to say. - What do you want me to say? - I don't know, but criminals? I wonder if I really did lose my brooch. - Mr Jo... - Oh! Now you're going too far. Poor Marcel. What a sucker you are. Yes, what a sucker you are, as the lady put so elegantly. If I'm such a sucker, why do you love me? - Well, I don't love you. - Yes, you do. - No. - Yes. - You must. - Let's get out of here. No, stay. You're not in the way. Love me or I'll denounce your friends. - He's mixed up in this too. - Who cares if he doesn't love me. You're always giving ultimadums. Let's get out of here. The old man will be back any minute. - Daddy. - That's it. We've had it. This is no time to faint. Bitch! - Is that you, Daddy? - Yes, child. - Back already? - Yes. I'm with Marcel. Has there been a reconciliation? I bumped into him coming out of the cinema. He apologized and insisted on seeing me. He could have waited. I invited him up with his friends. - Where's this leading? - Quick, hide the equipment. - The white wine was exquisite. - You seem to have done it justice. Just the once won't hurt. Of course not. - What now? - That's up to you. - How? - Save your friends. - I don't understand. - You're so stupid. Daddy... These are the friends of Marcel that I mentioned. Miss Loulou... and Mr Jo. - Sir. - Pleased to meet you. I see you've patched things up. - Indeed. - Not yet but we're getting there. I wasn't sure which path to take. There's only one way to go: the right way. Of course, the right way. The path of honesty and duty. - Of course. - Do you understand? But... That girl! She's thought of everything. Ah, Mr Jo. Were you looking for something? Please have a seat. Thank you but we were just leaving. Surely you can stay another five minutes. Anyway, I won't let you go. We can't go. She's locked the door. - Why? - How should I know? - Miss Loulou is charming. - Do you think so? She has a certain something. Offer them a drink. Well, Mr Jo? Will you have a drink? I wouldn't say no. You have five minutes to decide before I phone the police. Daddy, I think Marcel has something to say to you. I'm listening. Later, - whenever you like. You're inspecting my safe. It's the best of its kind. - It looks solid. - It's a new make by an old friend. - If you're interested... - Thanks but I have all I need. It's based on an American model only with an extra chamber. - Fancy that! - You need that in this job. I once had to house a million stones in there. A million? - Isn't that right, Marcel? - Yes, but not at the moment. - No, 30,000 francs at most. - That's still quite a lot. - It's quite safe. - Not really. You get expert safe-breakers. They steal the contents in no time. - No! - They come with blowtorches. Blowtorches? Well I never! They cut a hole in it about 20cm wide and they make off with the contents. - They are incredible. - Amazing. - Not all of them. - Perhaps not all of them. It's like in any profession: some are expert and some useless. Of course. Excuse me. I'm going to show you how thick the safe is. - Jo's not interested in that. - Yes, I am. Look Miss Loulou, a bit of pressure on the key and a turn to the left. - Hold me back. - Do you see that? Mr Mercandieu, close that up again now. It's for the best. Why? - Who could that be? - Hello? It's you, Miss Renee. From the dining-room telephone. Have you spoken to Daddy? No? Then I'll telephone the police. You've got three minutes. What did she want? To remind me to ask you something. - Not for a pay rise, I hope. - No, no. I'm listening. - I need a while longer to reflect. - Take your time. If I don't ask for her hand, she'll denounce you. I don't want to get you arrested but I can't marry her. You take some persuading. - Is that Renee again? - Probably, yes. - Do you mind if I answer it? - Go ahead. Hello. Jo speaking. Yes. He was going to. No kidding! You wouldn't do that? Of course he wants to ask your father. He's just about to. - What does she want now? - Your daughter is mischievous. She loves playing tricks on her friends. Hurry up. I don't want to spend a night in a cell. I don't love her. I'm not a sucker, you know. Just ask him anyway or she won't let us leave. Tomorrow you can say you were drunk. What was it you wanted to say to me, Marcel? Marcel told the old man he wanted to marry his daughter. - We were shocked. - And now he wants out of it? Are you kidding. He'll marry the girl. Who cares, as long as he brings us our tools. We could hardly take them in front of the old man. - Hello. - What did I tell you? Marcel, meet Gegene - Here are your tools? - So when's the wedding? - In a month of Sundays. - Bravo! Good man! - What does Renee say? - I haven't told her yet. - Don't you dare? - Who, me? I have something to say to you in private, Loulou. Through here. I'll be right back. See you later, friends. - What do you think of him? - He's funny. What about Loulou? Now the break-in has failed she'll dump him. You can't be serious, Marcel? I don't mind rewarding you but I can't share my life with you. We're from different worlds. You'll always be on the losing side. - The losing side? - The side of honest folk. - I don't want to marry Renee. - Why not? She's a good-looking girl and rich. What more do you want? - Love. - I'm telling you, you love her. Do you think so? When I'm with her, I want to slap her. When Tintin's not in jail, he slaps me about but he loves me. Good morning, Miss Renee. Hello, Jo. I've come for Marcel. - He's back there. - With Loulou no doubt. Of course. I don't love Renee. You seem to be trying to convince yourself. You're just stubborn. Renee's come for you, Marcel. See? She's even chased me here. I can't have a moment to myself. Earn some respect, like Tintin. Men are in charge, remember. - I won't marry Renee. - You won't marry her? No, I won't marry Renee. I'm not a sucker. - So you've made up your mind? - Yes. Right. Bring Renee in. What are you going to do? It's simple. If you don't marry her... she'll denounce us. - You wanted to talk to me? - Yes. You know too much about us and I don't like blabbermouths. - So I've made up my mind. - To do what? - To kill you. - Don't do that, Loulou. Beat it, Marcel. Be a man. The kid knows too much. - You'll have to kill me first. - Thank you, Marcel. Don't be scared, Renee. I'm here. Steady on! Sorry. The urge was so strong. Carry on. It doesn't bother me. They're so cute. So you won't shoot? What with? There are no bullets in my gun. I've proved what I had to prove. You love your Renee. Hurry up and marry her. And remember my advice. Well? They'll get married and have lots of children. And we'll need to find another way of getting money to Tintin. Let's toast our friendship with a jar. - But Daddy's waiting for us. - Let the old man wait. - All right, darling. - There. You've earned her respect. You can count on me. Goon - Goodbye, my friend. - So long, you old fool. Marcel... aren't you going to say goodbye? - Won't I see you again? - No. Forget us and I promise we'll leave the jeweler alone. - It's for the best. - You're probably right. - Goodbye, Loulou. - Goodbye, Marcel. Hey, Marcel? Here. Your girl's brooch. I don't want it to cause you grief. So it was you. Yes, I just picked it up without thinking. But I want you to have fond memories of me. Thank you, Jo. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Marcel.
