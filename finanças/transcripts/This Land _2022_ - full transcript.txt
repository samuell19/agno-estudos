[bass plucking] J [birds chirping] [Gregory's husband] Thirty-three years ago today, I was dressed up as a jazz dancer in black tights and pink tutu, and I had no pink tutu. I was-- I was very masculine. And Gregory was dressed up as an English schoolboy in Knickerbockers. And that's how we met. [Gregory] This is almost like Christmas. [Gregory's husband] This is a mess. [Gregory] Then the next thing I know, I'm sitting at his table for Thanksgiving, and I met his entire family. Little did they know. Guess who's coming to dinner? Yes. The conservative. Yes. [chuckling] If he was anything like he is now, I probably wouldn't have stayed with him, if he was this rabid conservative and-- [Gregory] I'm not a rabid conservative. I don't give a crap about them. You're just-- [Gregory] I just vote. Yeah, but it's how you vote, it's just awful. I just feel like, uh, you just meet certain people on the road at certain points in your life, and everything works, and then people start changing as the-- you know-- you know, they just change.

Please, uh, bring Cecilia home soon so that we can all be here together. -In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. -[all] Amen. January 2018 is when basically our life changed, when my wife left to go back to Mexico. We had, uh, agreed with the government that we had a-- our plane tickets for her to leave, to go home. [Ashton] It's like... North America. And-- and this is South America. [Jason] And then just six months later, my son was diagnosed with cancer. There's no way to get Cecilia home because she can't apply for a visa until at least ten years has gone. It's been three years and we're still in the same boat. Being a Christian, I believe that God is going to take care of us as long as I do what I'm supposed to do the right way. Which is why I voted for Trump for voting against abortion. And now we're in the situation that we're in. [man] So I don't know what's going to happen. You know, they's already talking about rioting and going to-- going to where the election comes out tonight.

I knew something was following me. I heard it breathing. It was big. I could hear its feet in the ground and the weight. The thump of the feet. And I started running. I'm here. I see you. I was going to die, and I wanted to run away. And I got introduced to smack, black tar heroin, for five bucks. And that was my way out. It never bothered me when I was high. [dramatic thudding] But I can honestly tell you today, I'm not afraid of anything. I'm not afraid of anything anymore. J [reporter] Traditionally 18 to 29-year-olds have a lower propensity to vote. But this time around, we're looking at a lot of first-time voters, voters who have grown up in the era of Parkland and school shootings, um, and they are motivated, uh, and they're out there voting in exponentially larger numbers than they have... [man] I will never forget. I will never forget. A man that had no business running for office because he had a great life. But he did it to sacrifice for me, my family, your family... I'm one of those people where if I don't expect too much, it's very hard for me to feel disappointed. So, I don't-- I don't put that much weight in a government system that was not designed for me anyway. So, I just do me. Trump, Biden, it's like...

I remember it was a big deal to my family that year, but not as big as it is right now. Dun, dun, dun, dun. My-- my sticker was bigger than yours. I felt like I was taking a test in there.

That's such a false-- -And you said-- -No, they're not. You said the other day that-- that Black-- most Black men will be voting for Trump. -Uh-huh. -You're so full of it, Gregory. [Gregory] Okay. We shall see. [husband] You've been brainwashed for so many years. [Gregory] Really? No. I've been off the plantation for so many years. All right, now you-- I'm done fighting with him. Talk to him. You lived together for 33 years. [Gregory] Uh... Thirty-three years ago, would you have had the same feelings you have today? [Gregory] Pretty much. I did. [friend] So, what is it about Trump that you like? [Gregory] How about the economy? [crosstalk] [Gregory's husband] He's trashed the economy! [Gregory] No, he hasn't trashed the economy. [Gregory's husband] He did because his-- he didn't manage COVID properly. [Gregory] Oh, God, did anywhere-- Europe is having the-- the same spike that we're having now. [Gregory's husband] Europe is a lot more intelligent-- [Gregory] Oh, really? Throughout the morning, we saw a pretty steep foot traffic before we even got an hour.

Our communities count. Count every vote. All votes must be counted everywhere." All votes must be counted. And you know 100 million have voted. So, you know you're screwed. You know, there is a lot of cemeteries in this country. And they all vote Democrat. [reporter] ... election like no other in modern memory but to expect-- Well, with record-breaking early voting turnout, an unprecedented amount of legal wrangling and all this occurring against the backdrop of a global pandemic, no one can definitively predict what's likely to happen before the evening's over, and it could be a long night once returns start coming in. But with a look at what we can expect from our election night coverage, two voices-- [Darin] With my way of thinking, um, I put it this way. The way that I'm living now, you know, I'm making ends meet. I-- you know, I'm unemployed. I don't have much going for me, really, to tell you the truth. I'm injured, which happened a long time ago. But within taking that person's life, accidentally and tragically, I believe it hindered my life. I can't find a job because you have to report if you're a felon. Then they want to know what you did. Well, I got in a fight with a guy that had a gun. And I'm not the one that is in the cemetery. I'm the one that lived. And I got to live with that. Their judgment of me, the way they look at me. And they say, "We'll keep your application on file, and you might hear from us someday. We'll want you to come to work for us." But when you're walking out that door, you know those eyes of judgment are boring a hole through your chest. Looking at your backside. "Trash. Get out of my company." For what I did. I paid for it, every day of it. And then some. It's terrible being caged. I cry, I scream, I curse, I kick. And it's a mad thing that I can't get over. When do I ever win?! Ever! I can't seem to make it in this world. I might be a redneck to some people, but the way we look at it, I'm a cowboy, not a redneck. [girl] What is-- what is a redneck? What's a redneck? You know what a redneck is. Redneck-- redneck to me is, you know-- You got a-- It's probably a-- a person that's does-- isn't that up to par on everything and, uh, maybe a little, uh-- I wouldn't say dumb, but me, man, we're just cowboys.

And I just thought "Oh, I just gotta make a change here. I don't wanna go back to college ‘cause, uh, then I'm-- then... kind of in the closet and that sort of thing."

I said, "How is this freaking possible?" [quest 2] There are things about Trump that I liked. I liked that he was a businessman. I liked that he was not a politician-- [woman 2] I laughed out loud. I'm still laughing out loud. [quest 2] Hated his personality. [Ted] Trump is a malignant narcissist. Oh, here we go. So, you're a psychiatrist now? [woman] I'm not necessarily pro-Trump, I'm anti-Liberal. [woman 2] They should ban guns completely. [Ted] Except for hunting or whatever. -[woman 2] So somebody-- -Who is showing up at your house? Who is showing up at your house in Cousins Island to fucking shoot you? Like, seriously. Like, who is showing up there? -Nobody! -[Gregory] Why don't you ask-- -Nobody! -[crosstalk] [woman 2] I'm sorry. You are the most belittling person. You need to stop because we are all here trying to have a conversation and you're being super belittling. And I'm over it. So, you need a timeout. [Ted] You don't need your fucking guns. -You need a timeout. -You don't need your guns. -[Gregory] Yes, we do. -[crosstalk] [Ted] Wow. I'm sorry you guys are fucking retarded. [indistinct arguing] It's not fine because it's fucking rude. And one of the issues-- No, Ted. One of the issues with the fucking world right now -is people like you. -[woman 3] It's true. [Colt] Get back up. Go. Biden's, uh, daughter, Camille Harris or something, she was coming out of a state and there was a bunch of Trump diesel trucks, Trump train running beside the van, Biden/Harris van following them all the way down the interstate. [growling] Black smoke. Blowing the black smoke out. They had flags everywhere. You kind of maybe got here a little bit of Trump country, but it's all good. No, no-- uh, no offense. [indistinct chatter] The guns don't kill people. -People kill people. -Kill people, that's right. [Colt] And if you take the guns away from everybody, they could still find a knife. Yeah, and I got three of them in my pocket, too. [indistinct]. Uh, and I know how to use them. -That's right. -That's how I've been all -my life, is use them. -We can skin them and hang -them like a deer, right? -That's right. But, you know, all these people-- these Black people that's getting killed. It ain't the white people that's killin' them, it's the Black people that's killin' them. -They killing each other. -He's right. We talked about that earlier, you know, I mean, and-- and what if you got pulled over and they tell you to put your hands up in the air or on the steering wheel? -What you going to do? -Put your hands up or put them on the steering wheel. You're gonna follow the directions like -you're supposed to do. -Right. Well, hey, we don't want to take it either, do we? And the first thing I'm gonna tell him is, "Look here, buddy, I am loaded to the gills with guns." "I have the right to bear arms, sir." Black lives matter, but so does everybody else's. So, why-- why is anybody different? You obey the law. Don't run from the-- don't run from the law. Don't reach into your pocket to pull something out. I mean, you kind of asking for it on some things, you know, to me. I mean, that's just-- behave when you're supposed to behave, follow the rules, follow the law, and you won't have a problem with the law, man. He is the kind of candidate who-- who is the-- who could do the best with white working class voters that a Democrat can possibly do, which is not that great, but better, obviously, than Hillary Clinton. And, you know, Obama was able to win there. So, I mean, he's got a-- a white working class sensibility. But he's also appealing to what we're calling the wine moms. [guitar tuning] [playing folk melody] J Easy Joe for president. What? I vote for you. I vote for you. [children chattering] [Gregory's husband] What is very, very befuddling to me about Gregory is he is a kind, uh, considerate, uh, generous person... that really identifies with a political view that's not that way at all. In fact, it's just the opposite. [Gregory] When your family asks me what happened to you, I said, you said your family pushed me this far right because of their intolerance. You know that you and a lot of left leaning people are political bigots, and bigotry, whether it's religion or race or gender or politics hurt the same. -Well-- -Yes. I'm sorry you feel that way. [indistinct speech on television] Well, I'm just-- you know, after this election, I'm done. -I'm finished. I'm done. -With politics? Good. ‘Cause I'm done, too. They can all just go down the merry road to hell and I'll just go my own way. [Gregory laughing] [reporter] Top of the hour, the state-- [Gregory's husband] Close to our anniversary, my dear. [Gregory] Yes. [Gregory's husband] To 33-- [Gregory] Here's to my best friend. [fire crackling] Haven't Ashton... like... [sniffles] going through cancer treatments... and I was the only one that could be here. And he would ask, Where's Mommy? And when is she coming home? -[sniffles] -And she's never coming home. I mean, it's just... heartbreaking. [calm percussion music playing] J [musician] It's a piece of metal welded together and cut to make certain sounds and noises. Do you want to play? [percussion music playing] J [indistinct chatter] [anchor] This is a complete farce and a travesty. [Sean Hannity] He's been hiding the entire campaign-- [reporter 1] The results of the 2020 presidential election are still undetermined. [reporter 2] President Trump saying his police and military supporters could make things very bad for his opposition. [reporter 1] Democracy takes its time as it determines the political future of a nation of, for and by the people. Any number of who may care a lot, a little or not at all what happens. [reporter 3] Gathering inside the Atlantic Arena, where ballots are tabulated, they question the integrity... [soft piano music] [news reports continue] J J You ready for this? All right, here we go. Hold your eyes closed. How many times have you seen me put on my makeup? -A lot. -Hundreds? I always do it the same way, don't I? [girl] I thought boys don't put on make-up. Boys don't, real men do. Are you a clown? -Where does the red go? -On my nose. -Always. Clowns noses are? -Red? Working that magic, turning into our alter ego. Turning into that cowboy hero. Oh! What? You remember what we say at the rodeo? [girl] What? -When I say "Ye," you say-- -[girl] Haw! -Ye-- -Haw! When I say, "Ye," y'all say, "Haw." Yel -[girl]] Haw! Ye! J [Barry] All right, big boy. Come on. Gotta go to bed. I'm going to get mommy and we can-- she can tell you good night, okay? Okay. [Shelly] Look.

Love you, big boy. [Shelly] What should we sing? The song-- [Shelly] You want "Twinkle, twinkle?" -Lizzo, Lizzo. -Lizzo? -I'm not going to sing Lizzo. -Please? No, I was thinking more like a lullaby. -[farting noises] -[Ashton laughing] [Jason making snoring and farting noises] [Ashton laughing] [Shelly] ♪ The itsy bitsy spider ♪ ♪ Went up the waterspout ♪ Down came the rain and wiped the spider out ♪ ♪ Up came the sun and dried up all the rain ♪ ♪ And the itsy bitty spider ♪ ♪ Went up the spout again ♪ Are you getting tired? -[smooch] -Love you.

We put a towel in there for them, and when we went to check on them, we roll-- we pulled the plastic up with the stick and they were all together, you know, all together. They just had big bellies from breakfast. It's good. We're doing the best we can.
