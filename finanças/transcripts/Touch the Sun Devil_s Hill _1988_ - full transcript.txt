[slow, suspenseful music] [cheerful music] [birds chirping] [cheerful music] [water splashing] - Go, Leia! [cheerful music] [dog barking] - Hey, Dad! - Here, Killer. Hey there. - Mom made this for you. - What do you reckon it is? - Cornish pasty maybe. - Well, it sure smells like a cornish pasty. You want a bit? - Yes! Thanks! How's the bridge going? - Oh, she's coming along. She's going to make all the difference, you know. Your mom's going to be just that much closer to town. I'll be able to get the cattle across the river. We won't know ourselves. [dog barking] Ugh, what have we done to deserve this? [dog barking] Relatives. [dog barking] - Shut up, Eddie. Dave! - Look, Pa! Big river! - Sheppie! Sam, I thought I told you to keep an eye on your sisters. - Bron, you're supposed to be looking after Sheppie. - Sheppie, you stay away from the edge. - Hey, you kids, hop up and get the supplies from the truck. - Come on, Bron! - I thought I told you last time, we don't want any more supplies from you. Not what you call a charity, mate! [water gushing] Hey, Badge, give us a hand, son. [suspenseful music] [gushing water] [suspenseful music] [water gushing] [suspenseful music] - Why have you got your eyes shut? - I didn't need them open. - Good day, Sam! How are you? Hello, Sylvie. - My name's Sheppie now. - Why is that? - She wants to be a sheepdog. - I do not! I just like it better. Anyway, what's wrong with sheepdogs? - Why all the supplies? It's not Christmas yet. What's the matter with everybody? - Mom's in the hospital. - Why don't you just get yourself down there? Jessie will take care of the kids, and I'll look after your farm. - I never liked hospitals, Dave. But I'm not sending the kids empty-handed. There's plenty of tucker and I put half a pig in one of them sacks. - I'll pay you back everything that I owe you. I just don't want you to worry, mate. - Yeah, and that half pig of mine might fly. Look, it'll be easy on everyone if you and Jessie were where you belong, here on the farm this side of the river. - Oh, look. We've been all through this. We tried that before. - Tried? When did you ever stick to anything? Over the years, you've been kicking around us all and working for other people when the two of us would have made something out of this farm. - Jessie and me wanted a place of our own. - Pie in the sky, Dave. That's pie in the sky. - Look, Linc, the only thing that's standing between me and some of the best dairy country 'round here is this flaming river, right? Now, when I get the cattle... - What cattle? You lost the cattle and me best bull! - [Dave] You'll get your bull back. In a couple of weeks, I'll be driving the hood across here. - Come out of the clouds, Dave! There's nothing for you over there. When are you going to wake up yourself? Think of Jessie and your boy. When all this is over, God willing Florie gets better, you'll have to come back. Forget all that. - Dad, I want to stay with Uncle Dave. I want to help him look after the farm. - We've been through this, Sam. You do as you're told or I'll tan your hide. Now, Sheppie, don't you be a trouble to your Auntie Jess. Bron, you look after Sheppie. All right, girls. - Wee! - Whoa! [gushing water] - Now, listen, Sam, you're in charge of your sisters. You muck up on this one, my boy, and you'll answer to me. Right, away you go. - Dream on! [suspenseful music] - I'll see you in a couple of weeks, eh, Badge? Give this to your mother for me, will you? No, it's for your mom. I want you to look after things while I'm gone. Look, I know that Sam's a bit of a worry. - Does he have to come, Dad? - Well, you've heard your Uncle Linc. You know that Florie's pretty crook, so why don't you give Sam just a little bit of room? - Okay. - See you, mate. - See you, Dad. [horse grunting] - [Badge] Hey, Bron, you could get on Leia if you wanted to. - [Bron] No, that's okay. I'd rather walk. - [Sam] She's scared of horses, scared of everything. What's this place of yours like? - It's real good. - I bet it's a dump. My dad says you've got no-- - Shut up, Sam. It's not his fault. - None of us wanted to come, you know. - The horses need to rest. - Yes, sir. - Whoa. - You okay, Sheppie? - [Sheppie] Yep. - Ah! - Sam! - Tell me to shut up, will you? For that you must be punished with a Fu Manchu Chinese burn! [Bron screams] What's up, Bron? - I hate you, Sam. - Can't you take a joke? - Here, Bron. - Don't trouble with girls. - Sheppie! - [Sheppie] Coming! - What's the big one called? - [Badge] Devil's Hill. - Devil's Hill, eh? Pretty spooky. - My dad named it. He's the only one who's ever been there. - Yeah, big deal. [horse grunting] [harmonica playing] - Gee, that's a beauty! - Yeah, I got it in the city when I was with Ms. Berry's. Want a go? - Oh, yeah! - Not for nothing! What have you got? [tinkling] - I can't let you have it. - Give us a look. It's not worth anything, just an old piece of glass. [tinkling] [Sam laughs] - Come on, there's a storm brewing. - Oh, nothing that I haven't heard of this morning. [harmonica playing] [cheerful music] [dog barking] [harmonica playing] I was right. It's a dump. [dog barking] [ducks quacking] - Hello, Killer. - [Badge] Hi, Mom! - Hi, Auntie Jess! - Well, this is an unexpected visit. - [Bron] Our mom's sick. - How bad's your auntie? - Pretty bad, I reckon. This is from Dad. - I'll take that. You're all welcome. This is your home for as long as you need it. Come on, girls. Let's put the kettle on. I'm very impressed, Sam. Nobody told me you were a magician. - No. - But you've only been here two minutes, and you've made a loaf of bread disappear. - Sam can eat a horse [laughs]. - Yeah, that's what Dad always says. - He's not having mine. - You've got to go back to school next year. - We stop every month. Why would you want us to go back there? - I bet you will. My dad said. - I hate that school. - If Mom hadn't been sick, I would have gone down to Ms. Berry's when I was in the city. - We never asked you to come here. - How much pocket money do you get? - I don't get any pocket money. - I get six pence a week. Sometimes I get a shilling if there's a lot of work to be done. I'm saving up for a bike. - I'd much rather have a horse. - A bike would be no good around here anyway. - I bet you can't stay on. - I bet you I can. - Go, Bessie, go! - Hey, away! [cheerful music] - Hang on, Sam! Woo! Come on, Bessie, faster! Come on, Bessie, come on! [Badge laughs] [cheerful music] - Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo! [Badge laughs] - Help! Bron, help me! [wind howling] - How long have you had Bara? - Ever since I can remember. She's the best cow in the world. Aren't you, Bara? - [Sam] What's her name? - Brendall. [thunder] - How'd you lose the rest of the hood? - We didn't lose them. Kicked the rail down and they all skedaddled. - We gave that bull and you had lost it. - My dad will find him. - He hasn't yet. Dad reckons you can't stay here. He reckons you'll have to leave. [thunder] [cow mooing] [wind rustling] [thunder] - Come on, girls! Let's get inside. Badge! Sam! [thunder] [rain gushing] - They won't bite. - Mom says I break things. - Where is the wireless? - We don't have one of those, Sam. - No wireless? - No electricity, no wireless. - Well, what do you do at night? - Badge does his schoolwork. I do the dishes. - But what about the serials? We'll miss the Twilight Ranger. - What's that? - [Bron] Oh, the Twilight Ranger's really good. - The Twilight Ranger. - [Sheppie] The demented poetry is better. - Nah, that's cheesy stuff for girls. Shadow, num-num-num-num, who knows what evil lies in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows! - Now, why do we need a wireless when we've got Super Sam? Here you are, Sam. - No, thanks. That's a girl's job. That's what Dad says. - Well, over here, if you're man enough to eat off a plate, then you're man enough to clean it. - [Bron] Sam, clean up the dishes. - What do you reckon, Sam? - This looks like a job for the masked avenger! The least of my job, though. [thunder] - Scared? - She's scared of everything, Aunt Jess. She's even scared of my own shadow. That's what Dad reckons. - Who cares what you think? - It's smart to be scared. You don't laugh at the weather. You watch out for it. [thunder] - I can do that one. - It's my work. I'll do it. - Do it then. - You're only up to fourth grade. You'll be a year behind when you start school next year. - I told you, I'm not going back there. - In fifth grade, the teacher makes you do English compositions. - It's just making up stories, Badge, that's all. - Yeah, but the teacher makes you read them out in front of the whole class. - You don't have to worry about that, Sam. He can tell a story. - Go on, then. - Go on, Batch. Tell us a story. - What, The Three Bears or Mother Goose? - Give it a go, Sam. - [Sam] He doesn't know any stories. - I know so. I can tell you about Devil's Hill. It's not a made-up story. It really happened. You see, Dad was out looking for the lost herd. He was out four days into the wilderness before he found their tracks. He followed them down until they disappeared into the bush and the mists rolled in. But he kept on going. - Was he scared? - My dad doesn't get scared. - Neither does my dad. - Go on. [thunder] - He kept on going until he came to a ledge where he waited for the mists to lift. When the mists finally did blow away, he could see right across this valley into the hills. And that's when he found the cave. [thunder] Dad was stuck for the night, so he made camp in the cave. When the sun went down, the mists rolled back. So he lit a fire and lay down beside it. He woke up in the middle of the night. The fire was dead, and he heard this sound, like every cow he was looking for was right there inside the cave. His skin crawled. He could feel something watching him. - Aaah! [Bron screams] [thunder] - That was a warmer. - Mom! That's a tree down! - There's nothing we can do until the morning. You sleep tight now. - Mom's going to be all right, isn't she, Auntie Jess? - Of course she is. Sam, I know it's hard being here, but you've got to make the best of it. You'll be home soon and your mom will be fine. Good night. - Good night. - Sleep tight, son. - You too, Mom. Gee, you've got smelly feet. [harmonica playing] [horse neighing from a distance] - I suppose we better clean up this mess. - I'm just going to see if Leia is okay. Where are the cows? Bara! [subdued music] Mom! - [Sam] Aunt Jess, come quick! - Get the branch quick! Mom! She's hurt bad. - Keep her still. She'll hurt worse if she tries to struggle. - Mom, we've got to make her better. We've just got her. - Just keep her still! - You'll be all right, Bara. - Is Bara going to die? - I don't know. - You'll be all right, girl. Don't worry. - No, Mom! You can't! - All right, I want all of you to go and try and find Brendall for me. Can you do that? Go on. - Mom, please. We can make her better, please. - Badge, if I could help her, I would. But she's hurt too bad to save. You know that. - But you can't! - She's in pain. I can't leave her here in pain, not when she's been so faithful. Now, please, go with your cousins and find Brendall. Go on! - Mom! - Bara, our girl. I'm sorry. [sorrowful music] [gun fires] - Come on, Badge. We have to find Brendall now. Come on. - Is Bara in heaven now? - Yes. - Cows don't go to heaven. People go to heaven. - Do dogs go to heaven? - Yes. - And birds? - Probably. - What about worms? Do worms go to heaven? - I don't know. - Auntie Jess! Brendall's gone! - We looked everywhere, and we still couldn't find her. - We've got to find her, Mom. We've just got to. - A search might take days, and I can't leave you lot here by yourselves. - I'll go then. - Me, too. - Badge, that's just impossible. - If we haven't got Bara and we haven't got Brendall, then we've got nothing. And then we'll have to leave, like Sam says. And that means Bara died for nothing. - I want to find Brendall. - Me, too. - We could all go. - Yeah. - You don't understand what that means. It can get very dangerous out there in the bush. [dog barking] [tinkling] - [Badge] Dad calls this the green gate. You walk through and it closes behind you. Then you're really in the bush. - It's like that story in the Bible, you know, Jonah and the whale. - Yeah, the bush just sort of swallows you up. - Come on, come on. - When I was at Ms. Berry's-- - Who cares? - Bara was a pretty old cow. She was hurt bad. - Just shut up about it. - She's just an old cow. My mom's in the hospital. I'm sick of this bush. - Won't be here much longer anyway. Good riddance, too. - What, do you want to go? - Dad says that when I finish the exams, I'll probably fly. - How come? - Electricity. [harmonica playing] - It's just like you said. We've been swallowed up by the bush. [harmonica playing] Why are you doing that? - So that I get no spiders in me boots. - I told you she was scared of everything. [harmonica playing] [tinkling] [wind howling] - Devil's Hill. [birds chirping from a distance] - Morning, Sam. - What's for breakfast? - Eggs and tomatoes. - I hate tomatoes! - You've got to eat them. - Morning, Badge. - Tomatoes, Sheppie? - Yeah. [water gushing] - There's snow on the mountain, Aunt Jess. - I hope it doesn't set in. [mischievous music] [Bron screams] - What's wrong? - It went in my boot! - It's just a beetle. - I hate you! I hope you get warts! - Go on, stick out for the girls. What a crawler! - Who are you calling a crawler? - You! You're a crawler. - How come you pick on everyone? - I do not. - Well, you pick on Bron, and you picked on me when we entered the farm. - Yeah, you'll be coming back to the farm and you've got nowhere else to live. - We will not! - You couldn't live out here without my father's charity. - You take that back! - You take this back. [horse neighing] - Badge, what do you think you're doing? I should give the pair of you a good hiding. When we've eaten what we carry, we go hungry. Get that into your thick skulls. If your father was here-- - If my daddy was here, Auntie Jess, he'd tan their hides. - I'll tan your hide. Clean up the mess and then clean up yourselves. [water gushing] If she came this way all right, I'm blowed if I know how she got over that stream. - Cows jump over the moon! - Hmm, it's possible. I wouldn't put anything past Brendall. - Auntie, this was above the water not long ago, wasn't it? - That's right! The stream was down before the storm. It rose after she got across. - Good thinking, Badge! - I can do that, Auntie. - Next time, Sam. Tie this up first on that tree over there. Now just take your time. It's fast-flowing, but it's not that deep. - I'll be all right, Mom. [water gushing] [tinkling] - Badge! [water gushing] [suspenseful music] Badge! [water gushing] - Over here, Badge! Over here, Badge! - Sam! [suspenseful music] - Be careful, Aunt Jess! - Give me your hand! Give me your hand! [suspenseful music] [Aunt Jessie breathes loudly] - You okay, Auntie? - Yes, I'm fine. - The masked avenger, eh? Come on, give us your pack. - I can do it. You're not like Sam. Sam would never offer to help. - Oh, Sam's all right sometimes. - I wish I lived hundreds of years ago. - Why? - It was better for girls then. Boys weren't like Sam. They rescued you when you were in distress, and they even put their coats down so you wouldn't have to walk in the mud. - I reckon I'll have to think about it before I mop that mud with coat. - We'll make camp here. Don't anyone go wandering off. All right, Sheppie? - Yes, Auntie Jess. - When I was when I was at Ms. Berry's while I was in the city-- - Ohhh. - She had this huge electric heater, one type for cold water, one especially for hot water. - Still doesn't sound that good to me. - Oh, yeah? Well, I could get on a tram and ride to the beach and swim in the ocean. And then I could go get peaches and have an ice cream, not what Mom makes at home, but a real one! And I could still be home for tea. And it only cost me one shilling. - ♪ They say that this London's a wonderful sight ♪ With the people here working by day and by night ♪ They don't sow potatoes or barley or wheat ♪ No, the people are digging for gold in the street ♪ At least when I ask them, that's what I was told ♪ So I thought I would try at this digging for gold ♪ But for all that I found there I rather would be ♪ Where the mountains of morn ♪ Sweep down to the sea See, Sam, there's two sides to everything. [subdued music] - Are you all right, Mom? - Yes. - We're not going to give up, are we? - We've got food for nine days. When that's out, we'll move back to be safe. We're not risking anyone's life for a cow, not again. - If we don't find Brendall, will we have to leave the valley? - We'll manage, Badge. We always have. And if we have to start again somewhere else, then we will. - We won't have to. I bet we'll do find Brendall and Dad will finish the bridge. And we won't ever have to take anything from Uncle Linc again. - You remind me of your father sometimes. Big dreams. All the things we would be if we could be. The best spread in Tasmania, that's what he said the day he found the valley. - And it will be, too. It's our home, Mom. Dad won't let us lose it. - Badge, things don't happen just because we want them to. Even your dad knows that. - But Mom, we can't give up. - No, son, we won't. As long as you're around, we'll never give up. [subdued music] You stay here and wait for me. I don't think Brendall came this far, so I'm going to backtrack. - Can't we come with you, Mom? - I'll go faster alone. Badge is in charge. If I'm not back by midday tomorrow, you start for home. Promise me. - Yes, Mom. - Yes, Auntie Jess. - Now, you all look after each other. You know why I can't leave you in charge, don't you? - Yes, Aunt. - See you, Sam. - Good luck, Aunt Jess. [subdued music] - Auntie said we weren't to leave the camp. - We need water. - Sam's just sulking because you're in charge, that's all. - I didn't ask to be boss. Anyway, what difference does it make? Devil's Hill. [cow mooing] - There must be a track down there. - We haven't got time to look. She'll get away! - How do we get down there then? - We'll have to climb down. I'll go down first and search the track. Bron, keep Sheppie back from the edge. [tinkling] [suspenseful music] - Badge! - Brendall! Brendall, come back! - We could have caught her, easy as pie, if you hadn't been chicken. She's gone for good now, and it's all your fault! - I'm going to see if there's a way down. - What good is that now? - Whatever. - You stay here. - Why can't I come too? - Who's going to look after Sheppie? - I can look after myself! - Come on, Sheppie! Let them find their own track. We'll go look for water. [tinkling] - Bron! - I'm all right. [tinkling] - Everyone's scared of something. - Well, I'm not scared of nothing. [dog barking] - Look, water! [suspenseful music] Look, Bron! [Bron screams] - Bron! [suspenseful music] - Hi, Sam! - Why did you scream? - I didn't scream. I just called out because I found water. - Come on, something scared you. - I wasn't scared. Was I, Sheppie? - Bron wasn't scared, and she didn't step in that either. [Sheppie laughs] - I think Brendall came this way. [Sheppie and Bron laugh] What are we going to do now? - I suppose we'll just sit here and wait for Aunt Jess to get back. Of course, Brendall will be long gone by then. - We're going after Brendall. We'll take Leia and a day's food. We'll leave the rest here. - Aunt Jess is going to be awfully mad, Badge. - She'll tan your hide, Badge. - Mom won't be mad if we find Brendall. Anyway, if she is, I'll be the one to cover us. We'll go half a day. If we haven't spotted her by then, we'll turn around. - What if Auntie gets back before we do? - We'll leave her a note. [cheerful music] - We'll never catch her at this rate. - Of course, if Bron wasn't scared of horses. - Sam's right, Bron. It might be better if you and Sheppie both ride on Leia. - Do I have to? - Well, if we don't catch the cow, we'll know whose fault it is, won't we? - Just give it a go. - Come on, Bron. It's easy. - Leia will look after you. - Okay. - Put your foot in the stirrup. Use this to steer her. Just relax. - She won't move. - Just give her a kick. It won't hurt her. - Come on, Bron. Kick her harder. Yaaa! [Bron screams] [suspenseful music] [Bron screams] [whistle] - Are you all right? Bron! - Yeah, I'm okay. Give me a hand up. - You don't have to ride if you-- - I want to. - Okay? - Yup, I'm all right. [cheerful music] - Cows are supposed to stop and eat. She just keeps going straight ahead. - Straight for Devil's Hill. Maybe she's a ghost cow. - Oooh! [wind howling] - At least we tried, Badge. - Yeah. - There's the Southern Cross. - I saw a shooting star before! - That means someone needs helping. - Oh, come off it. - Everyone's got a star. It looks over them, their own special star. - Come on, they're just planets and things. - Boys don't believe anything. One of those stars is looking over us, and one of them is over the hospital, where my mom is. [tinkling] Don't tell Sam I cried. - I wouldn't. [Bron sniffs] - You didn't tell us what happened to your dad in the cave at Devil's Hill. - Well, he saw something. Eyes, yellow eyes. Then they were gone. After, cattle tracks he was following, he got to the bottom of Devil's Hill. [mischievous music] - Sheppie? Sheppie's gone. Sheppie? - [Badge] Sheppie! - [Sam] Sheppie! - I'm over here! - Sheppie! - You know you're not supposed to run off like that. - Oh, I was just talking to Brendall. - Huh? - Over there! Me and Killer were talking to Brendall. [suspenseful music] - We'll never catch her in this mist. [gong banging] - Hey! Get off my horse! - I'll get that cow. Away! - Come back here! - Sam! - I'll flatten him! Fair dinkum I will! - What good will that do? - It'll make me feel better, that's what. If he sends my horse-- - We won't have to climb it in this fog, will we? - I hope not. - Were you always scared of being up high? - Yeah, no one knows, not even Mom and Dad. - It's not your fault. You can't help it, like I can't help being scared of snakes. Everyone's scared of something. - I get scared of Dad sometimes. - Sam's not scared of anything. He told me so himself. [horse grunting] - [Badge] Leia! - No wonder your dad called it Devil's Hill. - Sam! [echoes "Sam!"] - Maybe the devil's got him. - Come on. [tinkling] - Do you reckon this is the same cave your dad found? - This is where the devil lives. - I don't know. [tinkling] - See anything? - No. - Waaa! [Sheppie and Bron scream] - You're a looney, Sam! - Can't you take a joke, either? - You nicked my horse, you can't stand a night without tucker or water, and you want to make jokes! - She'll tan your hide, Sam. - Shut up, Sheppie! I nearly found Brendall. I lost her tracks just below the cave. - You scared the girls half to death! - Scared you too, I reckon? Welcome to Devil's Cave. See the campfire? I reckon this is where your dad found camp at that time. - I don't like staying here, just me and Sheppie. - Someone's got to watch out for Brendall. She must be around here somewhere. - Me and Sheppie don't want to stay here. - Look for firewood then. We'll need some for tonight. - Sheppie, you keep moving! - Cows move a lot. Brendall moves all the time. Moo! - We won't be long. Just got to find some water. - And don't get scared while we're gone, because this is Devil's Hill. There could be things hiding around here, things like snakes. - Don't listen to him. Anyway, you've got Killer with you. - I wonder how Mom is. - She'll be all right. - Find a few more of these, at least we'll have something to eat. - When I was at Ms. Berry's, when I was in the city, there's this fish and chip shop. - Start looking, will you? It will be dark soon. [suspenseful music] - Badge! Badge! - Stay still. Don't move. [Sam breathes loudly] Are you all right? Did he get you? - No. - You were lucky. He's a beauty. Hey, do you reckon Bron could use a snakeskin bag? - Yeah. - And if we get really hungry... - [Bron] Who says? - I says because I know. - How come you're the only one who knows about it? - I don't care if you don't believe me. But I was stuck there. When the bus broke down and Dad was coming to get me, the school wasn't locked, so I went back inside for my pencil case. It was real dark inside. So I got the pencil case, and then I felt this shiver running right down my back, so I headed for the way out. I could feel this thing following me. - He's lying, Badge. - This thing was getting closer, so I started to run. But I couldn't find the door. This thing was getting closer and closer, and I just kept running. So I came around this corner, and there was this big black shape there, and it had no face! - Give it back! - Come and get it! - That was a stupid joke. - [Sam] She's a baby. What do you want a doll for? - Because Mom made it for me. - You better get some sleep. We've got a long hike tomorrow. - I can't get to sleep. - Sam didn't mean it. - He thinks I'm stupid, so does Dad, so does Mom. Everyone thinks I'm stupid. - I don't think you're stupid. I think you're really nice. [tinkling] - When I grow up, I'm going to go really far away to the other side of the world. The stars are different there. And then when I'm rich, I'll come back, and then they'll be sorry. And I might even buy some new cows. - Thanks. - Hey, you could come, too. - Yeah. At least you've got a home to come back to. [tinkling] I'd like you to have this. - I couldn't take that. - Go on, I'd like you to have it. [tinkling] It's a hollowed world in there. [tinkling] [birds chirping] - Two spuds and a bit of bread, that's all we've got left. - Badge! Bron! Badge! Sam found Brendall! [gong banging] [cow mooing] - Sam! Get Brendall! [cow mooing] - Easy now. Easy, girl. Easy, girl. [mischievous music] - No, Brendall! Brendall! - I could have had her, if you hadn't been so stupid! - Who are you calling stupid? - You! You're stupid! Give up! - No! - You're scared just like you were scared silly! - Shut up! - Stop it, both of you! - You're bad, Sam! - That was our last chance. [horse neighing] Sam! I'm warning you, get off my horse! I'll knock your block off when I catch you! I'll knock your block off! - What are you going to do? - I don't know! - He sounded just like Dad. - I'm sorry I yelled at you, but I've had him. - That's okay. We're used to it. Maybe he'll catch her. - Sam couldn't catch a fly with two pounds of sugar. [suspenseful music] - Breakfast. - Thanks. - Sheppie! - Come on! Come on! Come on, Leia! [gong banging] Silly horse. Come on! - Sheppie! She couldn't have sneaked out past this. - Where is she then? Sheppie! - Badge, you don't reckon there really are ghosts up here, do you? - No, of course not. - What about what your dad saw? - [Sheppie] Bron! - Sheppie? - [Sheppie] Bron! - Sheppie! - [Sheppie] Badge! - Bron, grab a hold of my legs. Sheppie! - [Sheppie] Where are you? - [Bron] Can you see her? - There's a tunnel! I can hear her but I can't see her! I can hear it's coming down there. - So what are you going to do? - We can't leave her down there. - No, but I don't like caves. - You can stay here if you like. I'll go. - And suppose you don't come back? - I'll go in first, then you hand the lamp to me, all right? - All right. - Okay, Bron, pass me the lantern. - I'm coming through. I've never seen anything like it. - Me neither. [horse grunting] - [Sheppie] Bron! Badge! I'm over here! - Sheppie! - It's better if we just follow her voice. [tinkling] - [Sheppie] Bron! Badge! I'm over here! Bron! [dog whimpering] Badge! [gong banging] - I'm over here! [echoes "I'm over here!"] - Which way did she go? - Take your pick. - Yellow top taxi, one, two, three. Yellow top taxi, you are here. [gong banging] - We keep going up. Why can't she stay put? - [Sheppie] Where are you? [echoes "Where are you?"] - She could be anywhere. [a strange roar] [tinkling] [a strange roar] [creature roars] [Bron screams] - It's just like your dad said! Horrible, with big yellow eyes! - Listen. [a creature roars] - Run! [Bron screams] Hurry! [suspenseful music] - Hi, Badge! - Sheppie! - Hi, Bron! - What are we going to do now? - No way down! - Let's go back through the tunnel. - Uh-uh, not without the lantern. - Bron, come on! - No, Badge. Please, please don't make me go down there where the devil thing is. [tinkling] Please? - Okay. [tinkling] I'll go to the top. Then I'll throw the rope down. - Be careful. [tinkling] [suspenseful music] - You're getting there, Badge. [suspenseful music] It's okay to be scared, Badge. [suspenseful music] Good on you, Badge! - I'll throw the rope down! [suspenseful music] Wait for us at the top, Sheppie. - Okay, Badge. [suspenseful music] - Keep climbing, you'll be all right. Don't worry. [suspenseful music] [tinkling] - Sam? [mischievous music] [tinkling] [cow mooing] - Don't move, Sheppie. - Okay. [mischievous music] [tinkling] [gong banging] [mischievous music] - [Bron] Brendall, come back! [dog barking] [suspenseful music] - We did it! - We did it! We did it! Wooo! - We did it, Bron! - Where are you going? Come back here! - Sheppie! [dog barking] [suspenseful music] [mischievous music] [cows mooing] [cheerful music] - Aunt Jess! We got them! [cheerful music] - Aunt Jess! - Aunt Jess, we got them! - Mom, we did it! We got them! We got them all! [cheerful music] [Dave laughs] [cows mooing] Dad, we did it! We got them! [cheerful music] We did it! Sam got the horse, and we found the cave and the tunnel brought us to the top of Devil's Hill! [cheerful music] There! - Dad! - Daddy! [slow music] - Daddy! - Mom's going to be all right. [slow music] It's good to see you, son. [mischievous music] - Well, I'll be-- - Pie in the sky, Daddy! Pie in the sky! - I'll be blowed! [Linc laughs loudly] [Dave laughs] - Here, have this stirrup. - Gee, thanks! - You know what, I reckon school might be all right. - It's okay if you've got mates. - You know, we'll look out for you. - Your sister's pretty fussy, isn't she? - Yeah. - Huh, boys. - Huh, boys. - Hey, Auntie says I'm nice. - Tan your hide, Sam! - Shut up, Sheppie! [Sheppie laughs] - Next holiday, I reckon I might go back. - To Devil's Hill? - There's a bigger one, further on. - What's it called? - It doesn't have a name. No one's ever been there. - I reckon I might go there too. Sam's Hill. - What about Sheppie's Hill? - Bron's Hill sounds better. - We can't call a hill after a girl. - Why not? [everyone laughs] [cheerful music]
