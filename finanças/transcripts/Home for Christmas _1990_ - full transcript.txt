(whimsical music) (lighthearted music) (siren wails) - [Woman Voiceover] I've heard it said that Christmas is a time for children. A time, I'm told, for magic. But who's to say? Is it magic or a coincidence? Is it chance, or something else? And sometimes, once in a long while, it is a time, not just for children, but for everyone. I remember a Christmas not long ago just like that, when something wondrous happened. - [Girl] Hello. - Hello. - What are you looking at, mister? - I'm lookin' at a photograph. - Who's in the photograph? - Someone you don't know. Didn't your momma and poppa ever tell you not to talk to strangers? - Yes. - Well, then why didn't you obey them? You shouldn't talk to strangers when you're all alone. - I'm not, my brother's over there. - Oh. Well, don't you think you oughta run along? - Bye. - Goodbye. (peaceful music) (chuckles) - You're nuts, Amanda. You've gotta stop running up to people like that. You're gonna run into some weirdo someday. He'll grab you and cut you into little pieces. - I just liked the look of that old man! He looks like someone I should know! - Yeah, sure. Come on. ♪ Brightly shone the moon that night ♪ ♪ Though the frost was cruel ♪ When a poor man came in sight ♪ ♪ Gathering winter fuel (staff applaud) Hold onto that joviality, it's Christmas, after all. Finally, finally we come to the pillar of efficiency. The man who would never make a move without drawing up six lists and eight schedules, the master of cost improvement. Our own Attila the Hun and district manager rolled into one, Reginald E. Spencer. (staff applaud) (background chatter) Come and get your gift from Santa Claus. - Thank you very much, Santa. And, uh, thank you, slaves. Can I open this? - Please do. For goodness sake, just rip it open! - Come on, let's go, let's go! - Come on, open! - [Staff] Whoa! (laughing) - You're all fired. I've always wanted one of these, I really have. I'm gonna give it a try here. Hey, would you like to get in? (whip cracks) - Whoa! (playful music) (suspenseful music) (car horn honks) - And you're gonna promise me to stay away from here till January the second. - Maybe. - No maybe about it. A burnt out slave driver is no good to anyone, least of all me. - Okay, Michael, you're the boss. - So get out of here. And have a good Christmas. - Thank you, you too. Bye bye. - Reg, don't forget the little token of our appreciation. - Ah, thanks so much. Bye, everyone! Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Happy New Year! (suspenseful music) - Hey! Hey! Hey! (tires screech) (peaceful music) - Hi, Dad! - Hi, Mr. Spencer! - Bye, Dad! - Bye, Mr. Spencer! - [Amanda] I'm gonna kill those guys! - Hi, Muffy. Hey. (dog barks) - I'm telling you, he's got a problem with that dumb name. - It's not a dumb name. - Muffy? Give me a break. It's a good thing I didn't let you name the kids. Give up, you're beaten. - Oh, you can say that again. - Bad day? Was the party a disaster? - No, the party was fine. Oh, they, uh... They gave me this. - It could be handy. - I tried it, it doesn't work. I caught some jerk breakin' into the car. Stole the phone, made a real sweet mess. - You call the police? - Oh, yeah, but they'll never get him, he's gone. - Hi, Dad. - Hi, Amanda. What did the boys do this time? - They were using Fred for target practice. - That's bad. - I can handle it. They're just boys. (peaceful piano music) - Come on. (playful music) (tense music) - Hi, Oscar, how are ya? - Good, Elmer. You knock off a bank or something? - No, no such luck. I forgot the combination to the safe. (laughs) But I was passing a very dark alley and in that alley was an automobile, and somehow my hand got wrapped around a phone that was in the car. What do you know, it was loose. It was worth $1,500 bucks and I took it to big-hearted Lupo. You know what he gave me? 125 bucks. Hm! How's Marie? - She's still on tour. - Poor old flake. I wanna go over and see her. (melancholic music) - [Marie] And yet what strongly would win-- - Marie. - Oh. Elmer. I'm so glad you're here. Elmer, my son is coming to get me this evening. We are vacationing on the Algarve. - That's very nice. I, um... I brought you this scarf. You look so pretty in it. - [Marie] Thank you, thank you, Elmer. We fail, but screw your courage to the sticking place and we will not fail. (moody saxophone music) - Morris! Get your hand out of that bag or I'll break your arm. - Hey, take it easy. - I mean it! Go on, keep the gloves. Help your arthritis. While you're at it, here. Give this 20 to Wally. Some medicine instead of that crud he's been takin'. And be sure the 20 is used for the medicine! And you make sure that you give it to him. - Okay. - Alright, go on. Ted! - Yo. A hat for ya. - And then he disappeared down the street. Telephone and all. You know, for an old guy, he really could move it. - [Wife] Well, anyway, there's no real harm done. - Well, yeah, except he kinda chewed up the car. - So, we'll get it fixed. The insurance will cover it. You did call it in? - I'll call it in tomorrow. You know, you think that old creep could've at least given it a break for Christmas. - Maybe Christmas is the problem. - What's that mean? - John wants me to do an article on how the destitute survive Christmas. I've been wondering what you do if you're homeless and penniless and it's Christmas. - Barb, for Pete's sake, the guy ripped me off. - Who ripped you off, Dad? - Oh, just an old man, nothin' to worry about. Amanda. Stop playing with your food and eat something? You know what? I think I'll go into the office myself tomorrow and work out that claim. - Aren't you forgetting something? - What? Oh, yeah, the shopping thing. Well, look, we can do that another time. This is more important, you guys understand? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Well, it's settled, then. What's for dessert? - Beats me. - Ah. Come on, Justin, let's see what we can find. - Okay. - Mommy? - [Barb] Mm? - Do you know anyone who doesn't have a home or anything? - No, I don't think so. - I think I do. - For a young guy, this guy could really move it. - So, uh... - So what? - How much did you get for it? - Enough. Enough for everyone for Christmas. That's if your taste don't get too extravagant. - Amanda, how many times have I told you not to talk to people like that? - I know, Mommy, I know I shouldn't, but I've seen him there before. Anyways, Justin was there. - What makes you think he's got no home? - I don't know. But he always just sits by himself. - Well, maybe he's just the sort of person I should talk to when I do my article. Think you could find him again? (peaceful music) - Justin. Justin! I'm coming to get you! You've been mean to your little sister. And now I'm coming to get you. - I'm really scared, Mandy. - Justin? - [Justin] What? - Do you think we'll ever get to see Santa? I don't think Dad understands how important it is. - I think we will, you will. You just gotta keep bugging Dad, that's all. You're really good at that. - Give me a break, Justin, I sure hope we get to see him. (upbeat music) (car horn honks) - Hey, there's my grandpa, come on, my grandpa's here. Grandpa! - Hey, champ, put 'em up! Okay, champ, I give up. How are you doin'? - I'm okay, can we go skating? - Whoa, Court, take it easy, come on. Let's get Grandpa in the house and give him a cup of coffee. He's had a long drive. - Yeah, Dad, come on in. - Okay. But right after that, Courtney and I are headin' out. We got places to go and things to see, right, champ? - [Courtney] Right, Grandpa. Hey, Grandpa, can my friends come, too? - Oh now, Court, I don't think that your grandpa wants to be taking-- - Oh, the more the merrier. As long as it's alright with their mom and dad. (peaceful piano music) - And then Michael sticks his head in and throws a fit because I promised I wouldn't be back until after New Years. - And? - And, uh... And he throws me out of the office, and I didn't get the claim done. - What? - And he throws me out of the office, and I didn't get the claim done. - Which is why you went down there in the first place. - Yeah. - And to duck out of the trip to see Santa. (door creaks) - Hi, Dad! - Hi, Arch, how are ya? - Well, I think the four of us are safe and sound, and pretty well stuffed. - Guess I don't have to ask if the kids enjoyed themselves. How about you? - We all had a great time. - Uh, look Arch, thanks a lot for lookin' after the kids this afternoon. - (chuckles) Like I said, no problem. Nice kids. Bye now. - Bye. You are a rat. - Now, what're you talkin' about, what did I do? - Nothing and that's the trouble. That nice old man did it for you. - Okay, okay, I'm guilty. Look. What if on Monday we all go shopping? You, me, the kids, all of us, we'll make a day of it. - My, what a guilty conscious won't achieve, you're on. (melancholic piano music) - Hi, Mom. - Hi, Mandy. Why aren't you asleep? And you ate too much junk. - No, I'm just thinking. - [Barb] Oh, I see. Wanna talk about it? - Archie's Courtney's grandpa, right? - [Barb] That's right, did you have a good time with him? - Yeah, I did. - [Barb] So, what's the problem, then? - How did Courtney get a grandpa? - Archie is Mrs. Whitney's father, that's how. - You told me once Dad's father died a long time ago. - Yes, that's right. - Why don't you have a dad, 'cause if you did, I'd have a grandpa, wouldn't I? - Yes, that's true. (chuckles) It's a long story, Mandy, and I guess it's time I told you. You see, when I was a little girl, my mom and dad went away somewhere and they never came back. So, I went to live with some other people. What they call the Children's Aid. - But why didn't they come back? - I don't know, Mandy. I've never known. I wish I did. Sometimes, there are things that we can never know. - Didn't they love you? - Oh, I hope they did, Mandy. I hope they did. - Don't cry, Mom. - It's okay. It wasn't all that bad. I met a lot of rather nice people. But you know what? I wish you had a grandpa, too. - Mom? I think we should adopt a grandpa, don't you? - I don't think I handled that too well. - Why not? - Look at me. - So your daughter knows that her mother's human. Is that a problem? - I guess we really are two birds of a feather. - [Amanda] Justin! Justin! - Yeah? - What're you thinkin' about? - I don't know. I guess I was thinkin' about Courtney's grandpa. - Me, too. He sure was nice, wasn't he? - Yeah. Well, grandpas are supposed to be like that. Were you just talkin' to Mom? - Yes. - What about? - Women stuff. Justin? - [Justin] Yeah? - You know what I think Mommy would really like? - What? - If we had a grandpa. - You think so? - I'm gonna ask Santa for one. - Don't be dumb, Amanda. - It's not dumb. I won't ask for anything else, just a grandpa. - Are you sure it's the same man? - I'm sure. - And you're sure he's friendly? - Well, he's not too friendly. But he's not mean. - Come on, Mandy, let's go. (Elmer snores) (Elmer snores) - Hi! Hi! - Oh. It's you again. - I brought my mom! - You brought... Oh. That's just great. (coughs) - She wants to talk to you. - About what? - I was just wondering if you'd mind talking to me about what you do. - Huh? - For Christmas, I mean. I'm Barb Spencer, Amanda's mother. - I figured as much. - I'm a journalist. I'm doing a story on the unfortunate and how they deal with Christmas. - The unfortunate? (melancholic piano music) What makes you think that I'm unfortunate? - Well... - Would you show us your picture? - No. - Why won't you talk to my mommy? I've decided, you're my friend, and I think you should talk to her! - Shouldn't you get Justin to help you with some of that? - Yeah, I uh, suggested something of the kind, but he strangely disappeared. Aliens, I think. So, where have you two been? - We went down to Allan Gardens. - I showed Mommy my new friend. - What new friend's that? - There's this old man she's made friends with. - Amanda, how many times have I told you-- - It's okay, Reg, I was worried at first, but he's okay. In fact, he's wonderful. He lives down in some weird old place on the lake with these other acquaintances of his. They all kinda take care of each other. Except, from the sounds of it, this old character, his name is Elmer, does most of the taking care. - Like me, you mean. - (tuts) Get real. I'm lucky if you cook one night out of ten. - But what we're dealing with here is quality, not mere quantity. - Shut up and stir. Anyway, I think it's really great that they all sort of gather together like a family they wouldn't otherwise have. But it still sounds pretty bleak. Some nights, there's nothing to eat at all. There's never any heat. Yet, somehow they survive, even at Christmas. I asked him what he did for money and he hinted he occasionally gets up to some vaguely nasty things. I'll bet he's a petty thief. - So you spent the afternoon talking to a petty thief who's made friends with our daughter. - I'm telling you, this guy is alright, well, more or less. - Anyway, it sounds like you got a good article started. - Yeah, pretty good. So, are you all set for tomorrow? - What do you mean? - You're not tryin' to back out of it again? - What? - The shopping trip, "we'll make a day of it?" - Oh, no. No, fine. - You hadn't forgotten? - Me? Let's see now. Okay, first of all, Amanda, you come with me. Justin, you go with your mother. We've got about 55 minutes and meet back here at 12:22, we'll talk about five minutes and then we'll switch. - Come on, Justin. - I'd say that Justin's-- - Come on, Dad. (peaceful music) - Yeah, Dad would love them. - Dad, I think I found something. (muffled chatter) I wanna buy that, Mommy. - You already bought Daddy something, Amanda. Don't have to buy him two gifts. - But it's not for Daddy, it's for someone else. - Who's that? - Somebody else, somebody very special. - Ho, ho, ho! And what's your name? - Amanda. - And what would you like old Santa to bring you for Christmas? - I won't ask for anything else, I promise, just a grandpa. - I don't know if I can do that, Amanda. But I'll try my best, and you be a good girl, and do what your mommy and daddy tell you. And have a very merry Christmas. (tense music) - Hey! Hey! Hold these, don't look at them. Stop! Hey! - Yay, my dad's going to get me a grandpa! - Somebody stop him! Hey! Stop, you! I got ya. - Reg! Reg, what are you doing? - It's him, this is the guy! This is the guy that ripped me off. - It's Elmer, he's the one I wanted! - It is Elmer. Reg, what are you doing? - Look, I'm telling ya. This is the guy that swiped my car phone. - Is this true, did you break into my husband's car? I said, did you break into my husband's car? - Well, maybe I did. - "Maybe I did?" That's not good enough, is it true, did you do it? - Yes, I did it. - You should be ashamed of yourself. Now, you apologize. - What? - Go on, apologize. - Barb, what is this? I'm callin' a cop. - No, Daddy, don't call the policeman! - Amanda's right, you're doing no such thing. Elmer, apologize. - Barb, be serious! He's a thief! - Reg, you be serious. If you call a cop, where's Elmer gonna spend Christmas? - I don't know. Jail, I guess. - Exactly, you want that on your conscience? And who's gonna help out back at the warehouse? - The warehouse? - Elmer, please apologize. - [Reg] Barb, who's gonna make up the damage? - You ever get around to making that claim? - No, I did not get around to making the claim. - Well, don't bother. Elmer can make it up himself. - And just how's he gonna do that? - He can work for it. He can work for you. - Doing what? - Odd jobs, cleaning out the garage. You were just about killing yourself yesterday. There's lots of things he can help out with. - And when is all this supposed to happen? - It can happen right now. And when he's worked off the value of the phone, well, he can stop, simple, is that okay with you? - It's okay with me, lady. - How about you? (peaceful music) (Muffy barks) - [Reg] It's okay, Muffy. - [Amanda] But Daddy, what about the presents? - I'll get them from the car later. Now, you kids go do something. - What? - I don't know, go read a book or something. - I don't wanna read a book. - Well, then watch some TV. - There's nothing on. - Look, just beat it, okay? - [Justin] Are you and Mom gonna have a fight? - No, your mother and I are not going to have a fight. - [Amanda] But, Daddy, I wanna stay and talk to Elmer! I wanna know if he's the one! - Both of you, uh, off you go, okay? So, what's on your mind, Reg? - I would like to have a word with you. In the kitchen. Now. (suspenseful music) Would you mind waiting right here? Guard him, Muffy. - How's it goin', Ralph? - Are you out of your mind? Making me bring an old piece of rubbish like that home? Do you realize that man in there could be a maniac or something and you're exposing your children to him? No, don't say anything. Do you realize that old man in there is a common thief? Maybe worse, he could be a serial killer, he could very well cut all our throats in the middle of the night. Doesn't that sort of thing occur to you? - I just feel good about this guy. I think he's in a spot, he needs us to help him out. (playful music) (Reg sighs) Okay, Barb. Okay. But I want you to know one thing, this idea of him sleeping in the basement is absolutely nuts! If we all wake up dead in the morning, it's gonna be on your head. Hello. I'll handle this. You. Come with me. You can sleep in here. I think you'll find it comfortable. - Reg, I just wanna thank you for not having called the cops on me. And, uh, I'll do anything I can to make it up to you for what I took. - Well... Thanks. Elmer. - What happened, Mom, is Dad really mad? - No, no. Everything's fine. Let's get you kids something to eat, and then it's off to bed for both of you, okay? - [Presenter] Don't miss Revenge of the Night. - It's the fourth mutilated body this week, Inspector. - Nobody knows where he'll strike next. (distant clunks) - Reg. - Shh, listen. (suspenseful music) - What is it? - I don't know. - The kids. - I'll go take a look, you stay here. (suspenseful music) (gasps) (groans) Ouch. (Elmer snores) (suspenseful music) - Did you lose your ball? (food sizzles) - Ah. That looks okay. - Yeah, I was pretty hungry, so I guess I overcooked a little bit, there's enough to feed an army. Would you care for some? - Yeah. Sure. - Did Reg get back to sleep alright? - Yeah, sorry about that. Tell me a little about yourself, Elmer. - Oh, not much to tell. - [Amanda] Hi, Mom. - Morning, Mandy. Want a little breakfast? Elmer cooked it. (Reg imitates a plane engine) - Okay. - Ah. - Dad! - Elmer. I've made a list and a schedule. I think you'll find them quite comprehensive. (playful music) - What are you working at? Are you trying to make this a career? - What? - Just watching and waiting. You're driving an old man crazy! - No, I was just checking. - Checking? On what? - Psst. Psst, Marla, come here. Get down. Get down. Look, look at that. - What, Sam, look at what? - Well, look what he's got now. He's got himself a handyman. Rats, now I'm gonna have to get one, too. - Sam, you're a lunatic. - Hey, Marla, we got that Christmas Eve party comin' up. You need a hand with anything? - My mom says you're supposed to come in for lunch now. - Tell her I'll be down in a minute. You still don't trust me, do you? - No. - Tell me, what did I ever do to you? - Nothing, but you ripped off my dad. - Well, you got me there. What're you lookin' at? - I like cookies, you know. - You do? You like cookies? Mm-hm. Well, uh, who do you think made these? - My dad did. - No, no, no, no. If your dad made these cookies, you can eat every cookie that you can find in your ear. - I don't have any cookies in my ear. - Not in your ear? Are they up there? No? - No. - Well, watch. Oh! There's the cookie. - A cookie. - Yeah. - Must be magic! - Well, must be somethin'. (water sprays) Hey! Hey! Thanks. (peaceful piano music) There we go. - Justin. Justin, are you there? Are you awake, Justin? - Amanda, if you don't stop buggin' me, I'm gonna scream. That's all you do, Justin this, Justin that. What do you want this time? - Justin, this is important. I think he's the one, I think Elmer's the one. - What're you talking about? What do you mean, "he's the one?" - When we went to see Santa Claus, I told him I wanted a grandpa. He said he'd do his best and now Elmer's here. I've been watching him and I think he'll make a good grandpa but he may need a little help. (playful music) (vacuum hums) - Guess what's out there, go ahead, guess. Bet you can't. - I don't know, what? - No, I said go ahead and guess. Hey, Dad, guess what's out there on the front porch. - Sam! - Come on, Sam, spit it out. - A handyman! Yeah, I've hired a handyman. (chuckles) Oh, Dad, he needed a reference, I gave him your name. Would you come in, please? - Sure, bud, it's your nickel. (tuts) (peaceful music) - Okay, kids, I got this pretty well worked out. Now, what we're looking for this year is a spruce tree, 'cause in 1980 when you were born, Justin, we got a spruce, and then we had a balsam and then a pine, and then, Amanda, when you were born, that year we had a spruce tree, too. Then we went balsam, pine, spruce, balsam, pine. So, this year we need a spruce tree. Now, it's going into the corner by the window. The ceilings there are eight feet high, the star is eight inches and we need at least eight-inch clearance. - Hey, Dad, over here, I found our tree! - Dad, she's right, this is the one! - But it's not a spruce. - Hey, Reg. You see? I got a handyman. - Oh, gee, that's great, Sam. Uh, what's he doing there? - Well, he's havin' his coffee break. - I see. - Look, I gotta go, I'll catch ya later. Okay, we still got a lot of work to do. Wanna get started, I-- - Dad, help us. - Oh, yeah, let me just get this, okay? Geez, I wonder what made Sam get himself a handyman. - Handyman? Yeah. Looks like you could learn a few things about bein' a handyman yourself. There we go, alright. Alright, let's go. (upbeat music) Alright, get that, I got that. - Front, back. (playful music) - He doesn't do windows. Okay, I want you to take these drums and move them onto the street. There should be a dolly around here someplace. - Those gotta weigh over 50 pounds. I don't have to lift them. - You don't have to-- - I don't have to lift them. I think it's the law, an employee shouldn't be expected to lift anything over 50 pounds. - Look, Liberace, these drums here gotta be moved, and I hired you to move 'em. - Okay, let her go. (Reg groans) - Couldn't find it. - Couldn't find what? - The dolly. - Yeah. (gentle festive music) (playful music) - I guess you could've found me a stranger son-in-law someplace, but I don't know where. - He'll be okay, Dad, you just gotta give him some time. - Hey, Sam, how's it going? - Okay. I guess. - Yeah, anyway, have you got a red-handle Robertson? Mine's gone missing. We're just putting up the tree, can't get it quite straight. - Oh, yeah, sure. Actually, I think it's yours I got, just a sec. - So, what happened, did you get a promotion? - Eh? Oh, no. (chuckles) I just figured I really couldn't afford to be without one. He came highly recommended, where did you find yours? - Find my what? - Your, uh, handyman. That guy I've seen workin' around your place. - Oh, you mean Elmer? I didn't hire him. He's just, uh... Well, he's payin' off some money he owes me, that's all. - Ah. Look, would you excuse me for a minute? - Yeah, sure, Sam. Thanks for my screwdriver. - You, you're fired. - I'm what? - You're fired. Done, finished! Sacked, no longer needed! Your services are not required at this time. Washed up, canned! - Hey, look, bud, I've worked the rest of the day here. We've gotta talk about severance pay. - You're gone, now. - Okay, guys, I think it's time to put the star on top. - Oh, I'll handle this. Justin, you go down in the basement and get the stepladder. And Amanda, you get the star. It's just at the bottom of the stairs. (Elmer snores) Hey, Elmer. (Elmer snores) - Leave the poor guy alone. You've been workin' him like a horse. - But everybody has to watch the star go on top. It's tradition. Come on, Elmer, wake up. (gentle festive music) - What? (clattering) (Reg groans) - Don't worry, I'm okay. - There you go. You... You better let me take care of that. - Hey, Amanda, it's time for Revenge of the Night. - [Amanda] Hey, wait for me. - So, how did you become so handy? - Had a job or two. I've learned a little here, a little there. - I wish Reg would a learn a little here and a little there. - Hey, look, if you want a district manager of a large metropolitan insurance company, I'm your man. - That sounds real handy. Anyone for coffee? - Yes, I'd like a cup of coffee. - Well, I'll take it into the living room. You guys go ahead. - I'll just help you clean up here. You're letting him get a little comfortable, aren't you? (melancholic music) - Jessica. What in God's name are you doing here? - That's my mother. - Your mother? She's, uh... She's very, very beautiful. - Yes, she was. It's coming up to 40 years ago that was taken. She died about, well, when Justin was just a baby. - Have you got a photograph of your father? - [Reg] No. I never knew him. But I always hated him, I can tell you that. - You hated your father? Why? - He ran out on my mom, before I was even born. Mom said it was just a couple of weeks after that picture was taken. He took it. - Are you sure it wasn't the other way around? - Yeah, I'm sure it wasn't the other way around. I should know somethin' like that, shouldn't I? - I'm... Yeah, I'm gettin' awful tired, I think I'll, go turn in. - [Oscar] Morris? - [Morris] Yeah? - [Oscar] Where do you figure Elmer's gotten to? - [Morris] Beats me. - I sure hope he ain't in jail. - He'll be alright. - Yeah. Except, tomorrow's Christmas Eve. - [Morris] So? always comes back for Christmas. - Yeah, well... He'll be alright. (peaceful music) - I'm glad you liked it. Well, I had a bit of firsthand help. Yeah, well, it was very interesting. Okay, John. Merry Christmas to you, too. Thanks, bye. Okay, Elmer, what happened last night? (melancholic music) - Think I'll have to be goin' back where I came from. There's a lot of old wrecks still waitin' for me there. Can't say that it hasn't been a nice experience. But what happened last night was... - Hi. - Oh. Hello, Barb. - [Barb] Thought you might wanna have a look at this. - Look at what? I know all about the homeless. Is that a picture of me? - Are you okay? - I'm fine. - I don't know what's bothering you, but it seemed to have something to do with that picture of Reg's mom? Did you know her from somewhere? - Don't, don't be ridiculous, of course not. I've never seen her. - Okay. Guess if you want me to know, you'll tell me. If you wanna talk about it. No sweat. I'll leave some dinner in the oven for you. We're off to the Whitneys'. See you when we get back, okay? - Yeah, when you get back. When they get back. Here. Now, don't you say nothing. - Hi! - Hi. - Well, it's about time you guys got here. Oh, here, let me take your coat. So, are you gonna give me a hand in the kitchen or what? - I guess so. - Okay, well then follow me. - Okay. - Hey, Court, come on. - Hey, Reg, how're you doin'? - [Reg] Hi, Sam. Nice tree. - Oh, thanks. Hey, come on, I wanna show you my new electric drill. - A new one? - Yeah. - Oh, does that mean I can have mine back? - [Sam] Yeah, sure, if I can find it. (melancholic music) - So long, Ralph. (Muffy whimpers) (gentle festive music) (knocks) - Who's there? - It's me, Dad, can I come in? - Yeah, come on in. - Oh, wow, nice outfit. (laughs) Oh, here, let me help. - What's so funny? - Well, Dad, I was just thinking. Maybe you don't need the pillow. - Ho, ho, ho. Okay, look. I've hidden the presents in the trunk of my car. I'll be back in a couple of minutes. (suspenseful music) - Hey! What're you tryin' to do, give me a heart attack? - Sorry. - Hey aren't you the guy that's visiting the folks nextdoor? - Who do you think I was? You didn't think... - Weren't you a fighter once? - How did you know that? - Archie Gilmore. You fought Al Pacherick in 53, right? - (chuckles) I whipped him, too. - You're tellin' me, and you whipped me out of a good bet! (Archie laughs) - Hey. You gotta come to the party. - I'd like to, but I-- - What're you talkin' about? Look, it's a matter of survival, you can talk to. I'm not so sure about the rest of them. Look. Help me out, we can talk about Al Pacherick. - You talked me into it, be right with you. - Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas, everybody! - [Guests] Merry Christmas! - [Archie] Oh, so nice to see you again. - [Amanda] Hi. - Well... Hi yourself. (chuckles) - Are you having a nice time? - I don't know, I just got here. - I'm kinda bored, will you talk to me? (upbeat piano music) - I think Archie must've bought the world's crummiest santa costume. - What about that one you had last year? Wasn't even red, a sort of orangey-yellow. I hope Elmer's okay. - What makes you say that? - I was just wondering if-- - Well, you can stop wondering, he's right over there. - Good heavens. What's he doing here? - Archie brought him in. Doesn't look like much of a mingler, does he? - [Barb] You know, I'm glad he's here. There's more to him than meets the eye. I think I'm gonna get him to dance. - I thought this was my dance. - Sorry. This is our dance. - Huh? - Come on. Come on! Oh, it'll be fun. I won't take no for an answer. - Mandy. Mandy, wake up. Come on, Mandy, I'll take you home. - But Daddy, I'm having fun! - Yeah, I can see that. - Well, looks like the end of the line for this one. - I'll take her home, you stay here. - Let me do it, I'd like to take care of her. - I'm not sure. - Ah, whoa there. I've got a little job for you, Justin. How about you help Elmer home with Amanda and get her to bed, okay? - [Justin] Oh, Mom, me and Courtney are having fun here. - [Barb] Well, you can take Courtney with you. He can spend the night if he wants. - There we go. Well... I'm off to bed, and I think you'd better be doing the same thing. - Okay, Elmer. Goodnight, come on, Court. - Goodnight. (peaceful piano music) - Goodnight, Albert. - Goodnight, Amanda. Promise me one thing. - What? - That you'll have sweet dreams. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, darling. (upbeat piano music) - Santa kept his promise. I've got a grandpa, my very own grandpa. (door opens and closes) (suspenseful music) No, you can't go away, not now! Justin! Justin! - Justin, what's that? - It's just my sister. - Justin, he's leaving! - Who's leaving? - Elmer! We've got to stop him! - Amanda, are you sure? - Justin, he's going! - Amanda, get dressed, he's not leaving if we can help it. Come on, Court. There he is, let's go. - Justin, I'm scared. - It's okay, Amanda, just stay close. Me and Court will look after you, right, Court? - Yeah, right. (pigeons coo) (wings flap) - [Justin] Hey, where'd he go? (can clatters) - [Amanda] Elmer? - Merry Christmas, kids. Hey, what're you kids doin' out on Christmas Eve? Oh, hey, you aren't scared of me, are ya? (chuckles) (suspenseful music) So, got any money here, eh? How about you, little cutie? Got a few bucks, eh? A few bucks for grandma maybe? (chuckles) Hey. I'm not foolin' around here. You kids gotta have some money, right? And I'm gonna get it. Come on. Come on! (wood clacks) - Hey, punk! Don't you touch those kids! Why, you! Keep runnin'! - Hey, Elmer, where you been? (melancholic music) - We thought if we could find them right away, then they wouldn't need to be upset. - Yeah, well I think this is a really good time for them to get upset, I'm going to get Sam. Amanda. Are you alright? - I'm fine, Daddy. - Are you boys okay? - No problem, Dad. - I want a word with you. - [Officer] Hold it, pal. - I don't know what your game is, but you're outta here. Do you understand? Now, get outta my sight. Go on, get lost. - But, Daddy! - Yeah, Dad-- - Later, Justin. And don't you ever show yourself around here again. Do you understand? You useless old man. - One day, she took me home to her family. They were horrified. They couldn't believe it. I had no clothes. (moody saxophone music) No money, no name. Wasn't long after that, they... They forbid her to see me anymore. But she'd find a way to sneak out. - Well, they're both okay. - I returned Courtney back over to Marla. He was acting like nothing had happened, so I didn't say much. Well, the party's still goin' full blast. - Well, I just heard the whole story, and apparently something did happen. - What? - When her family found out about it, they rushed her right off to Europe, and had our marriage annulled. It was not too long after that, I... I received a letter from her. Saying to me that she hoped that I understood. But I never did, I mean, understand what she wanted me to. She said she couldn't fight her whole family. They were bearin' down on her, never givin' up on her. Then their lawyer someplace in Europe sent me a, a check. Which I tore up. Threw away. Along with the check was a note thanking me for my trouble. (chuckles) My trouble. She had a baby. She had a baby boy. He was my baby. But I didn't know anything about it then. I don't know how things can happen like this, but, or why they happened, but our paths, seemed to cross again. Those kids... Those little kids that you saw tonight, were my grandchildren. (laughs) They were my grandchildren. And when I... When I took 'em back home, he... He threw me out. My own son. He didn't know that I was his dad, but he threw me out, wouldn't even, wouldn't even let me explain. I guess... Mr. Reginald E. Spencer, 19 Fortam Lanes, much better off without me. I guess they all are. - Oscar? - Yo. - Go out and get me a taxi. I'll be down in five minutes. - Where are you goin'? - Out. It's Christmas Eve. - You remember those people I told you Elmer sort of looks after? Well, it seems that he went back there to see how they were all doing. Now, Amanda saw him going. So, all the kids sneaked out after him. Now, when they got down to the warehouse, they lost sight of him. Then some creep tried to mug them, now, Elmer saved them. Then he brought the kids back here and you went nuts. (doorbell rings) What now? (Reg sighs) - [Marie] How do you do? I'm Marie-Louise Joliker. - [Barb] Good evening, can I help you? - [Marie] Well, first of all, you might invite me in, out of this abominable cold. - [Barb] Oh, sorry, come on in. - [Marie] Thank you. Now, would you please tell Mr. Reginald E. Spencer that I've come to discuss with him matters of great urgency? - [Barb] Sure, can I take your coat? - [Marie] No, thank you, but you may have these. - Come on in. Reg, this lady would like to talk to you. - Mr. Spencer, my name is Marie-Louise Joliker. The reason I'm here is quite simple, I came to return those. I have no wish to be the cause of friction, between you and your father. - What're you talkin' about? My father's dead. - I assure you, Mr. Spencer, that your father is very much alive and well. Your father is Elmer, a man I believe you've recently met. - What're you talkin' about? Is this some kind of con? - Reg. I believe her. There's something about Elmer. The way he looked at that picture. - Let me acquaint you with these facts, number one. Your mother's family was very wealthy. Number two, they disapproved of your father. Number three, he disappeared before you were born. Number four, your mother's name was Jessica. - You never mentioned your mother's name to Elmer. - [Marie] And number five, that photo? That is your mother. - How did you know that? - Because Elmer had a photo of her himself. He showed it to me. I recognized her. So, you see, Mr. Spencer, if you've been the subject of a con, as you put it, that con has been at the hands of your mother's family. - I, uh... (chuckles) I can't leave him out there, Marie. I have to find him. Can you show me where this place is? I'll call you if I... When I find him. - Okay. Goodbye, Marie. - Goodbye, young woman, merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - This way, Mr. Spencer. And where is Elmer? - Elmer? Said he was gonna take a bit of a walk. Who's the geek? - This, Oscar, is not a geek. This is Reginald E. Spencer. Elmer's very own long-lost son. - I guess now you sorta wanna get a hold of him, huh? - Yes. Tonight. - Well, you're gonna need some help. Hey, you greaseballs, listen up. (upbeat music) - I remember that letter. Every line of it. Yes, sir. I read 'em over and over again, then finally I tore it up and I threw it away. But I still remembered every line of it. Jessica. I thought you loved me. I should've known all along you'd realize that someday, I'd be nothing but an old man, sitting on a bench in a park, talking to a picture. - I didn't know anything, Elmer. Except that we were young, and I loved you. - Loved me enough to let your family take you away from me! And had a child. - Our child. - But you didn't tell me! (suspenseful music) - Look, Elmer. I know what I put you through so long ago and... Maybe nothing I can ever do will make up for it, but... This is my Christmas gift to you. - Christmas gift? - Your son, Reg. I'm giving him back to you, Elmer. - Oh. He wouldn't know me from a book without a cover. What does he need with an old bag of rags like me? - Hi, Elmer. (melancholic music) (sighs) I thought maybe we should talk. - About what? - She used to bring me here, my mom. I never knew why, until now. Marie told me. - Marie! That old flake's been out of it for years. She picked a good time to come back to her senses! (melancholic music) - So... What happens now? - Well, you just keep going on the way you're going, and I'll, I'll just keep going the way that I'm going. - But just how do I do that? Can you tell me how I do that? A couple of days ago, I'd never had a father. And now... - Can't you just see yourself now saying to your friends, "everybody, I'd like you to know my dad, the bum!" Get real, Reg. Get real. - I think I am real. I think Barb's concern is real, don't you? Don't you think Amanda's and Justin's wishes are real? They both want a grandfather. How much more real can I get? Alright, I'll leave. But could you tell me this? Will you please help me out on this one? What do I say to Amanda? What do I tell her? - Elmer, you fool. Don't mess this up. Years ago, I messed up when I let my family bully me out of having you. You messed up when you didn't come after me. You could've, you know. You could've tried. I was glad you tore up that check. But don't tear this up, Elmer. It's the only thing I can give you now. Take it. It's my Christmas gift to you. And Reg. And Amanda. And Justin and Barb. Take it. (peaceful music) - Thank you. Reg! Reg! (wind blows) (festive orchestral music) - Hi, kids. - Hi, Dad. - Hi, Dad. - Grandpa! - Amanda. - Merry Christmas! - How's my girl? - [Jessica] It was such a wondrous Christmas. Amanda got her wish and so did everyone else. And you know what? It took not one, but two Santas to do it. - Okay, everybody all set? Oh, let's have the Santas. Santa, come on in here and sit right there, and where's our other Santa? Come in here and sit right there. Nice and closely together. Okay, all set. Everybody squeeze close together. Stay there, there we go. Now, everybody smile now. Ready? (camera snaps) (background chatter) - A beautiful tie. - And, got it! (camera snaps) Good, thanks, everybody. (Muffy barks) - Shut up, Ralph.
