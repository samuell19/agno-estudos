Good evening and welcome to our special programme, dedicated to the most powerful men in the world. Stavros Mintas. Many biographers have written about the life of this man, born in a Sicilian village in 1920, son of a poor immigrant. What is also mysterious is the meteoric success of this magnate. His "discretion" did not help conseal what was happening in the background. For 30 years Stavros lived a secluded life on an island in the Pacific. From there he would supervise his wealth of over 20 million dollars. To find out more about his life, we carried out detailed and lengthy research. We managed to find many people who had known this Italian magnate. We felt it was right to present the witnesses' statements without commentary in order to give the reports more space. The material in many of these interviews will raise strong debate. From a clear clean spring - Roccaforte mineral water peps you up. I met Stavros in France in 1944. We were both fighting as partisans in the same group. He was helpful and nice and very popular. The operation is very important. We must do everything to stop the Nazis from stealing the art treasures from the museum when they retreat back to Germany. We'll start tomorrow morning. I'm relying on you. Come on! Hurry up! Faster! Don't fall asleep! We hid in the woods and waited for night fall. Then all hell broke out. After hours of fighting, we rescued the treasures and imprisoned the soldiers. I lost sight of Stavros. He rang me some time later in Paris. It was 1961. He invited me to Rome and and even paid for my plane ticket. Conello went back and got married. I never heard from anybody. - How are you? Over the next years, I tried contacting him. He always got his secretary to say he wasn't in. I don't understand why. Perhaps money changes people completely. I read about him in the papers. I never saw him again. If he sees this, send him my regards. I wish him all the best. Science and research for the sake of beauty. So that your hair remains silky. Madarina Ray - Paris. I began my acting career in one of the films produced by Stavros Mintas. We didn't like each other. He was often on set to check the filming. Every time there was trouble. His authoritarian behaviour was unbearable. He made us feel his contempt which affected the shoot. We had to drive away quickly. We couldn't stop the troops. I won't let him down. I'll come later. Don't be crazy. If we disappear together, then we'll be able to help him more easily. My brother means everything to me. The shots are in the can. - Are you joking? Monika is supposed to be an actress? If they're all like that, we can give up. - I think it has been well acted and is realistic. - I don't care what you think. She's crap. I expect her to do this scene again. - Okay, I understand. I don't want to be insulted by this snotty little upstart. He ridicules me in front of the team. He is the co-producer and has the right to speak. He is malicious and I have the right to my dignity and won't put up with this. I know a few things about you too. Watch out or I'll make things difficult. Don't harm a hair on his head. He'll pay for that. Give him to Gabor. He'll give him hell. Your wish is my command. - It should happen before sunset. If not you'll be overseers. - Cut! Perfect. Now scene 602. The winner is Monika Roccaforte. This prize was the springboard for my career. Shortly afterwards an agent from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer approached me. He offered me the leading role in "Sabrina". I got an Oscar for that. The rest is already well-known. But it isn't Stavros Minta who I have to thank for my fame. Tomato pur√©e Joally. Sunshine on your table. At the end of the 50s, I travelled with Monika Foster to Rome. We came from the country and wanted fame and fortune. I remember when an agent in our town came and was looking for actresses. It was meant to be a period film. Monika heard about it and convinced me to travel to Rome with her. We are looking for attractive actresses up to 25 years of age. Girls who are interested should come to Rome to be interviewed. Perhaps we'll get a role in the film. And be discovered. Get lots of money. I hope everything goes well. Please follow me. - Of course. These ladies are here for the test shoot. - Sit down. Would you like something to drink? Whisky, gin, champagne? - No thanks. - You want to audition? We are actresses and are very interested in the role. Where are you from? - We're from near Palermo. That's a long way from here. Did you study acting? Not directly. We've acted in the theatre many times. They said we're very talented. - There's a big difference between film and theatre. ls your friend dum? - She's always shy at the start. I hope that changes. For this film which is being prepared we are looking for 2 actresses to play the roles of slaves. You must be able to dance. Stand and move around. Move gracefully. Perfect. And now show me your tits. - Why do you want to see our tits? The slaves do topless dancing. I don't understand. - If you want to be involved, you have to show them. Very nice. That's not enough though. - No, no chance. Slowly. Perhaps with a bit of music. Kiss me. Come on. I'll make a star out of you. Alright, what is it? More intensive! You turn me on. I love your beautiful cunt. I feel ashamed. This awful man should not have been allowed to touch us. We behaved like whores. - Just understand will you?! If we wanted to be in the film we had to participate. Then it would work. - I don't believe that. They invited us out to eat. There was no mention of the roles. This evening he'll offer us the parts. - I hope so. I don't want to sell my body for the film. I'd rather go home than do that. Unfortunately I let him convince me to go for a meal. The old agent also had an agent from Germany there. He spoke fluent Italian and gave a pleasant impression. He was Stravos' business partner. These two will be in the next film. We'll see how it goes. Who's directing? There hasn't been a final decision yet. - Good. We realised that we'd fallen into the trap again. They filled us with alcohol and other drugs. I remember what happened to us later. Take the top off. Don't behave like that. - Is this really necessary? Show me your tits. Good, you do that. I might like that. That is promising for when we work together. I love your arse. Move. You sexy think, move! I've got a great role for you. What's wrong with you? Isn't a foursome great? Are you enjoying it? Your are very talented. You could move more too. Do you like that? Now it's coming. I'm going to spray in your face. Hold on to him! I've still got a hard on. That lasted a long time. I was right. We shouldn't have trusted you. You'll have to pay for that! I'll report them! - Everything will be fine. They're bound to give us a great part in the film. They raped me and will have to go to jail for that. I'm going home. I'll report them first. Then, They'll lose their desire to treat women like that. I then got to know Stavros personally. I don't know where he'd heard that I wanted to report the lads. It's been tossing through my head for years. Perhaps Monika talked to him. Now I can't ask her any more because she's become a famous actress. She denies it but she was happy to do many things for her career. I was called into Stavros' office and was surprised that he was so sympathetic and sensitive towards me. I heard that two employees have mishandled you and can understand your outrage. You want to report them. - Those swines raped us. They'll pay for that. - I can fully understand that. You have my sympathy. However, I'd like to make a suggestion to you. I've been working here 20 years. The company shouldn't be ruined by one creep. I promise they'll pay for it. I'll get even with them. Now to us. Would you be happy with 5 million Lira as compensation to put this unpleasant event aside? Stavros gave me 5 million Lira so that I wouldn't report them. That's not much these days. At that time it was. I went back to my village and bought a house. Monika stayed in Rome and became a great actress. Candlelight and champagne Salieri. Who could resist the temptation?! I've been working as secretary in Stavro Mintas' company. He wasn't my direct boss as I worked in the casting department. At the end of the 50s there was so much coming and going. All girls wanted to be famous and came with their mums and were prepared to do anything. All they wanted was for their daughter to get the role. Madame Monika. - That's me. Madame Sylvia. - That's me. Stavros' German partner in the film production company often came along. He wanted to test out the youthful actresses for himself. He was unpredictable. All his demands had to be met. Unless you wanted to lose your job. He was awful, cold and unscrupulous. He had no respect for other people. Your daughter can't suck cocks. Do something so that she understands. Make more of an effort. Don't disappoint him. He shouldn't get a bad impression. - I don't know how to do it. I've told you a thousand times. Push it deep into your mouth and suck. Very good. Listen more closely to your mum's advice. Push him in deep. Lovely, close your mouth. You learn quick. - You see, when you make an effort it works. - That's good. You want to disgrace me. Don't look like that. I told you everything. - Push right in. Close your lips. Harder. Don't look at me. Concentrate on the cock. Show it to my cock. Your daughter is lovely. Wonderful tits. Soft and firm. My compliments. You've brought her up well. - Thank you. I hope she gets a good role. - If she continues like this, she will. She won't disappoint you. Turn me on. Are you satisfied? Yes she picks things up quick. She is talented. I'll show you how to do it properly. Watch out. Watch your mum closely. Your daughter's got the role. It's very easy. Take the cock and move your hand up and down. Then you put it in your mouth. Turn me on. Give it to me. Now you try. Carry on. Suck him. Turn him on. You do that wonderfully. Push him right in. - Do it faster. Take him in your mouth. A change from writing. Is my daughter moist yet? I'm going to spray over your tits. Push him right in. You're in the wrong place behind the desk, you sex thing. You're wasted as a secretary. Turn round. I'm going to fuck you from behind. You sexy beast! I love your arse. Stavros came into our office once and complained that the casting agent was being disgusting and vulgar with the girls who were auditioning. He shouted like a madman. We stayed quiet as we didn't want to madden him. That's enough! If you all carry on like this, I'll throw you out. We are a serious business and no whorehouse. After resigning, I never saw the people again. But I did follow the incredible, economic success of Sen. Stavros. Also the tragic and mysterious end of his partner's life. Goldlight flows like gold down your throat. Goldlight - German beer. At the end of the 50s, I had to deal with Stavros. But only indirectly. I never got to know him personally. I was a witness in a trial. This sensational trial in which his company was involved in a scandal concerning underage girls. I was working in a boarding school run by nuns at the time. The girls who lived there were poor or didn't have parents anymore. They were supported by the church. They would normally be there until the were 18. There were strict rules. But this wasn't for ever. I've nearly done it. Just three months, then I'm off. I've already prepared everything. I'm looking forward to it. When do you finish? Soon. - Great. Time goes by fairly quickly. Where do you want to go. - None of your business. It's not right to leave this house without permission at this time. I just wanted some fresh air. I'll accompany you. - I want to be alone. Is that possible? The weather's bad and it's dark. - I like the dark. Be nice to me and I won't tell on you. I'd rather be on my own. She was so beautiful. I could only think of her. I'd done everything for her. I wanted to look for you. - I was in the garden and it suddenly started to rain. I stood under a tree. I told you the weather was bad. You're completely soaked. That's enough. I'm going to bed. - And leave me here? - I'm tired. We'll do it another time. - Then I'll talk to the principal. Sod it. I have to tell you something. - That's what I'm here for. What? Yesterday, Senora Bontempo tried to sneak out of the boarding school. She was in the garden. - What an accusation. Are you sure? I take my work here very seriously. I don't want anything to happen to the girls. - I'll speak to her. You must pay more attention. - You can rely on me. From tomorrow she won't move without my knowing about it. Promised. The next day, a man spoke to me who I'd never seen before. Excuse me. A man would like to speak to you. He's waiting for you. This man there. - Thank you. You're the one who looks after the girls. I have respect for people who take their work seriously. Let me give you a tip on how you can make things more pleasant. Why? Who are you? - That doesn't matter. I don't want to offend you. I would just like to give you some advice. What's that? - I'll give you an idea about how much you can earn. Stay here! - Why can the others go out? If you want privileges, then you'll do what I say. Okay? I feel ashamed of the way I argued. But there was no other way. At that time, I did everything I could to get that girl. Don't act so stupid. You're not the best pupil for nothing. Are you happy now? You should have listened to me straightaway I'm going to give you a good fuck. You're so lovely and narrow. More, go on! Give it to me! Fuck me. Over the next days, there was a strange atmosphere in the school. It was as if something had happened. And it had. The Carabinieri searched the school and arrested the principal. A few girls were prostitutes. Sen. Helmut was at the head. I heard that one of the girls reported of Stavros' colleagues. The rest is history. It was in all the papers. The grapes of Asnieres produce the most unique wine: Colmax. I was Sen Helmut's chauffeur for 3 years. He was Sen. Stavros' business partner. He had money. He loved luxury cars and owned many. Everything had to be perfect. He appreciated my discrete nature. He could rely on me. We both loved beautiful women. Many came to his office. Their mothers forced them to sacrifice themselves in order to get a role. Sometimes I'd watch these scenes in secret. Let's see what I can do for you. I liked that. It was worth it wasn't it? Good that you told her off. Look, she does it really well. Take your daughter's dress off and show me her tits. That really turns me on. You are both truely sexy. Slowly. We've got lots of time. You've got great tits. Go on, go for her breasts. Play around with them. Lick your lips like two whores. Kiss your mum. Stroke her tits. Give it to each other. Do it with your tongues. Give me your daughter. - Your talent is from me. - Carry on! We know that. Lick the finger and imagine it is my cock. Push your tits against my cock. Push him right in. Kiss your daughter. Pull him out. Push him in your cunt. I'll do it to you. Pull him out. Quick! Push him in the soft cunt. You are a lovely jewel. A great cunt and so moist. You've been waiting for that. Now give me a blowjob. A great one. Put him in your cunt. That's good. I often drove Sen. Helmut to the school which soon became famous in Italy. Unfortunately in an unglorious way. Get out and come back when the girl has gone. - Of course. He used to meet up with a blonde girl very regularly. I noticed her because of her extraordinary beauty. Have you been waiting long? - Yes but it doesn't matter. You're here now. - They spent hours in the car. I hid nearby in order to watch them. Kiss him. I want to feel your tongue. Lick the cock. I'm going to go crazy. That really turns me on. I love your shaved cunt. You're moist. I like that. Lick him. Sen. Helmut paid for my loyalty with special presents. I did rehearsals with one of the extras. With other intentions. You make me crazy. - You haven't got knickers on. Give me a blowjob. You do have a great arse. I thought you would be shy. I'm going to push you. I'm about to come. What a sexy cunt. I often brought girls from the boarding school to Sen. Helmut's home. There were always different ones. But they were all incredibly pretty. I knew what they did there. What I didn't know was that it was all part of a large prostitution ring. I thought he met up with them to gratify his desires. Although other men were often there, I thought it was part of the game. Where did you learn that? Your school is fairly messed up. Let your friend try too. You do that well. You are a hot team. Lick him. Lick her cunt. Do it for her. Turn her on. You're so beautifully moist. I'm about to come to you. Make yourself moist, you slut. Turn him on. Masturbate him. I'll give you one in a moment you slut. Can you do me a favour? - Of course, what is it? I don't want to work as a slut anymore. I thought you enjoyed it. Say it then Sen. Helmut. Stop it and go back to the boarding school. - It's not that easy. The principal joins in too. If we don't toe the line, Helmut punishes us. He treats us like slaves. I've been working for him for 2 years and no girl has complained. There were many of them. And they were all contented. That sounds strange. - He pays well. I can't complain about that. I don't want to be a whore anymore. Just a normal girl. I've saved up money and I want out. Can you understand that? I'll see what I can do. - Be careful. It could get dangerous. Can you help me? I'm happy to do anything. I want to stop. Those dirty men shouldn't touch me up anymore. I can't cope with it. - I found you very attractive. I decided to help her. Then something unexpected happened. That's good. Carry on. You make me crazy. I love you. You're so wonderfully narrow. Move around. You really have a sexy arse. Your arse is really narrow. That is good. Arse fucking is great. Open your mouth. I'll spray into it. Lick the cock. I fell in love with the girl and was then prepared to help her. Even if it meant losing my job. I didn't know the consequences. And for Sen. Stavros. - I've heard that Sen. Helmut wants to see me now. I'm frightened. What should I do. Help me! There's only one solution. Go to the police. Report these men. But be sure of what you say. I'll help you. -And then? What will happen to us? - don't know. I'll look for another job. We'll start a new life. We'll manage it. Sen. Helmut got two years. Sen. Stavros was acquited. It was a financial setback for Stavros. After this incident, I separated from this girl. Today I have a bad conscience about this. Brandy Negro e Azul. A taste of fiery Spain. In the second part on Stavros, you will see further interviews. We can't wait to hear about Stavros, who hasn't seen Italy for 40 years. There's a big event in Rome on the 15th December. Famous people are coming to this events, from showbizz and finance. The proceeds go to a humanitarian cause. Stavros is giving $10 million. The money is for rebuilding Kosovo. We will be reporting on this. Many thanks for watching. See you in the next programme. Until then, all the best. Goodbye.
