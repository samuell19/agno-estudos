[instrumental music] [eerie music] [music continues] [birds chirping] - Look out. - Ew. Ew. We got a trout. [indistinct chatter] That's for you, Abby. - What about me? - Next one. Alright. - Ugh. - Ew. Hi! [indistinct chatter] [bird caws] [bird squawking] [bird chirping] [engine revving at distance] [tires screeching] [screams] Where you goin', huh? [grunting] - Fuck! - Damn kid. [indistinct chatter] Is he out? - Is the kid out? - What did you do? Go, go. I'll open the trunk. Tie him up! Not a fuckin' bowtie, tie him tight! He can't feel it anyway. Shut up! - Grab him. - Wait. Got him, got him. Got him. Man! Ger, shit. [gasps] Come on! - Take your sweet time there! - Will you be quiet? [engine revving] [dramatic music] Okay, let's take a picture, um, just go stand with Abby. Go, go, go, you go down and stand together really close. Keep smiling, look at me the whole time, okay? Keep smiling, okay? Abby? Abby! Honey, look at the camera! Big smile, okay? Great, big smile. [music continues] [camera beeping] [camera shutter clicks] [music continues] [indistinct chatter] - What's that? Wow! - My iron ring. They give it to the engineers when we graduate. The iron's from the first Quebec Bridge that collapsed and killed thirteen people. - That's kind of morbid. - It's symbolic. I think they use stainless steel now. Iron turns your fingers black. Good afternoon, folks. We're about ten minutes from our destination and about ten seconds from your first glimpse of the Falls. Look, there it is. There it is. [camera shutter clicks] May I first give you my deepest condolences. Your mother was a force but you guys would know that better than anybody. Now, where's my glasses? So, I just sign this, and it's done? No, no, no, I need you both to sign it. She agreed to this? Well, the building's worthless, it's less than worthless when you count the cost of tearing it down. But that is a fair price for the land. The Charles Lake company? It wasn't exactly a bidding war. The Rainbow was everything to her. She wasn't given much of a choice, was she? This looks good to me. Laure? Laure! Come on, this is our legacy. Abby, are you serious? The agreement says we have six weeks. - Come on, we have to try. - Try? Try what? The -- the Rainbow? It's what mom would want. Mom arranged the sale that you just walked out on. The place is a dump, Abby, hookers wouldn't even use it. They're gonna turn it into a fucking glow-in-the-dark mini-golf, or something. Good. We grew up there! Yeah, one of us grew up.

Just so you know, the haunted houses aren't actually haunted. And the fun houses aren't actually fun. Ha-ha. Nice one, I like that. - Just saving you money, dude. - Hmm. Passing through? Here for a job. So, I guess, uh, I guess, you're a local? I grew up here. That means you're a local. I grew up here. You grew up here. Well, okay, well, Miss I-Grew-Up-Here I thought that this whole place was supposed to be like Vegas, and it's not. Well, it's the low season. They even turn down the Falls. How do you turn Niagara Falls down? It's a series of locks, divert the water to the power plant. I'm doing my Master's on the hydro dam. Trying to get that iron ring. It's an engineering thing. The metal's from a -- a bridge that killed a bunch of people. It's morbid, but...symbolic. Is that true, seriously? Hm, look it up. You know what I'd do? I'd dry the whole thing up. Like the Americans did back in the day. This is a nice town. But that thing drives people crazy. It's just a bunch of water falling over some rocks. [chuckles] Do you want another one? Sure. [instrumental music on TV] Oh! [laughing] - Oh! - Wow! - Whoa. - Oh, ho-ho. Well, it's not exactly how it looks on the website. Oh! [both laughing] - Wait. - Huh? Woo! I like that. - Yeah. - I like that. Okay. [breathing heavily] I'm a virgin. What did you say? Nothing. Wait, wait, wait, wait, did you.. ...just say you're a virgin? No. You're not a virgin, there's, uh.. You just, uh.. You just picked up a stranger in a bar. So, uh, what's up with that, huh? Hello? Fuck, weird as fuck! [engine revving at distance] Uh, sorry, no vacancy. Are you Abby? Abby, Charlie. I'm with CLC. No, look, I'm not here to start any trouble. We're a family business, too, I understand what you're going through, we, uh.. ...lost my father a few years back, it was, uh.. Condolences. [scoffs] I was actually surprised to hear from your mother when we did. Takes a certain kind of moxie to run a place like this. What does it take to pilfer it from a vulnerable widow? I just want you to know if you do change your mind.. No hard feelings. Really. Pleasure to meet you, Abby. [car engine revving] - Thanks. - For what? - Dinner. - It was his idea. So, Marcus, what do you do at the casino? Well, nothing fancy like your sister. He's our first line of defense. Tell her what you look for. It's very scientific. Okay, well, there is a certain art to it. Rapid blinking, um, placing objects between themselves and the dealer uh, feet pointed towards an exit. Well, verbally, it's stuff like, um, formalized language. I mean, like, uh, I did not have sexual relations.. [dramatic music] [music continues] [music continues] [birds chirping] [water splashing] Hi. Fishing lures. Just fishing lures today. But I have found other things, I can tell you. Like what? Oh, firearms, watches, wedding rings. That one's usually a grand gesture! Everything that goes over the Falls ends up.. ...flowing through this big basin here. Sometimes I get lucky. Walter. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah. Out of town? - Vancouver. - Oh, that's -- that's far away. Well, you've -- you've come to the right guy. Yeah, I -- I'm -- I'm sort of the town historian. - You like podcasts? - Uh, sure. Yeah, it's called "Over the Falls." Lot of history around these parts. An awful lot of history. - I bet. - Yeah, well. Uh, remember.. ...rate and review the -- the podcast. It -- it helps our rankings. [bird chirping] [elevator bell dings] [indistinct chatter] Abby.. But, how'd you get up here? I'm resourceful. What are you doing here? Visiting you at work, because you're my sister. You can't be here. So this is the eye in the sky. I'm just a supervisor, stop stalling. Remember back when we were kids? I don't quite know how to answer that. Remember I used to talk about the one-eyed boy? I remember you telling me about a lot of things. He had one eye. Okay, I found a picture. Before you say anything, just hear me out -- I can't do this right now, at my work. When then? Channel five. Come in, channel five. Yeah, surveillance, go ahead. [indistinct radio chatter] They're on separate channels, they can't be consolidated. Yeah. I have a break at five. If you want to visit your sister like a regular person, you can do it then.. ...in the lobby. [instrumental music] Hey, um, what are we doing here? Thanks for the lift, by the way. Laure would kill me if I got you involved. Look, Abby, um.. ...Laure has told me some...things. Abby West! So, how can I help you, Miss West? I want to report a kidnapping. - A kidnapping? - Yeah. A boy near the Queenston docks. - Thanksgiving weekend, 1994. - 1994? Yeah. - You witnessed this? - Yeah. - How old were you? - Seven. You were seven, hm. I found a picture, pretty sure those are the people that took him. - How old was the boy? - Older than me. Maybe 12, 13. Why didn't your parents report it? They didn't see it, I was the only one around. - Why didn't you tell them? - Well, I think I did. Well, I told my sister, but she called me a liar. [laughs] Well, yeah, is that it? - Yeah. - Thank you for coming in. - That's it? - Mm-hmm. I'm sorry, you -- you have an eyewitness coming forward about a child abduction and you're not even writing anything down. Based on my experience, I -- I don't trust your friend. - She's my sister-in-law. - You're married? She's my wife's sister! What is going on here? He's new. First week on the job, right? Fitting in? - So far. - Must be. Turning away a witness on a hunch? [exhales sharply] Hm, okay. Well, wait here. - You know him? - No. [dramatic music] Hey. Hey! Abby! What? This isn't one of your fantastical stories, is it? Is that what Laure calls them? [chuckles] - So? - No. No? There are no open or closed cases of a missing boy that match your date or description. So remember to sign yourselves out when you leave. [scoffs] [dramatic music] I just didn't like the smugness, you know? The attitude. You absolutely did the right thing. I mean, you just, you never know. Heck, maybe you -- you saw something in the papers and you just combined it in your head.. [whirring] [music continues] [music continues] [instrumental music] The best and the bravest have always been drawn to Niagara Falls. Called perhaps by the chance to showcase their extraordinary skills on the world's largest stage. Their names have become legend. But only one name electrifies the millions who flock to the Falls every year. Only one name rings out above the roar and thunder of the water. The Magnificent Moulins. [whirring] [dramatic music] Well, for several years, we've been looking for an entry point into the dinner theatre market. Now that search is over. Our audiences will absolutely love -- Yeah, we -- we -- we're truly, uh, indebted to Mr. Lake, yeah. He inspired us to create our greatest trick yet. - Mm-hmm. - It's because of him. - It's because of him. - Yeah, and.. But their greatest trick wouldn't be possible without the help of a very special assistant. - She is our -- - Tigers are family to us. They're like, um, collaborators. It's really a great evolution of our magic. Yeah. [dramatic music] [instrumental music on stereo] [scoffs] The leather jacket was a bad choice. You know, my grandad originally built this as a private residence. Priggish, right? But it was also used as a convalescent hospital by the Air Force after the war. I remember the school field trip. Well, that must have been after they got our historic status. But the future King Edward VIII sat in this very chair. Cool. He was friends with Hitler, right? - I'm here about the Rainbow. - Uh-huh. What were you gonna do with it? Uh, I probably shouldn't say, but, uh.. Glow-in-the-dark paintball maze. Killer, right? Killer. Look, I -- I know the folks down at City Hall. Maybe we could get a -- a plaque put up. The former site of the historic Rainbow Inn. Yeah? What do you think? What about a job? A job? You're the biggest employer in town. If I lose my motel I'm going to need something to do. Okay, uh, what did you have in mind? Well, I could get used to working in a place like this. [laughs] What does that mean? Um, well, it means that we can discuss it. Great. But, right now, I have a date with my family, so.. Is it in town? Why? [instrumental music on stereo] Remember them? They used to have a show on the hill when I was a kid. They used to be our crown jewel. - No! - Oh, yeah. Well, it seems like they crossed over to the dark side. Yeah, it was a major, major.. You're probably too young. Their son, they found him in the gorge. - No shit! - Yeah, suicide. The Bells found him. At least what was left of him. Are they sure it was a suicide? You've got a curious streak, huh? - Well, journalism school. - Oh, yeah. Well, from what I remember, the kid was, uh, troubled. - And you knew him? - Yeah, I did. Even took him under my wing, so.. So the Moulins just packed up.. ...took their show across the river? Yeah, something like that. [dramatic music] [door opens] [door closes] - Hi. - Hi. You never came back. Have you been staying here? - No. - No? [sighs] I remember the one-eyed boy. You do? I remember you telling me about some kidnapping, yeah. I also remember the fossil bones Enrique Iglesias, the prison letters. You see where I'm going? - What? I didn't lie. - Now you're lying to the cops. And you dragged my husband into this, are you crazy? It was his idea. Yeah, I'm sure he thought it was. Laure! I'm not lying. Just -- just give me two minutes. Two minutes, after that if you still think it's bullshit.. ...I'll drop it. [dramatic music] Okay, sit down. Laure. Hello. What do you know about the Magnificent Moulins? I don't know, tigers and smoke machines and corny magic tricks. Okay, this article, dated October 13th, 1994 states that Alex Moulin, the duo's only child was declared dead by suicide. He allegedly jumped into the gorge. However, they never recovered his body. So, how'd they know it was suicide? Probably the police didn't release everything to the press. Okay, fine. Now remember this? That was the day before Thanksgiving, 1994. Four days before the article came out. It's date-stamped, if you don't believe me. You said yourself you remember me telling you about a kidnapping that day. A boy, possibly like Alex. Besides that picture, mum took dozens of photos that day. This being one of them. Now watch this. I found this at the library. It's a film about the Moulins made two years before Alex's death. There. Look at that woman with the black hair. Now, look at this picture. [dramatic music] Laure, tell me I'm lying. Shit. Okay, I found something. "Collectively known as the Diving Bells. "The Bells were a local family of daredevils and rescuers. "Pulled over two hundred bodies from the gorge in the last half century." "The best and the bravest." Looks like it was a multi-generational thing. One died in 1977, Thomas Bell, a stunt gone wrong. He left four children, most of them still in the family business Catherine, Walter, Scott and Tony. There's a playground named after them uptown -- Wait, go back. The kids, what were their names? "Catherine, Walter, Scott and Tony." [speaking in foreign language] ...to the "Over The Falls" podcast recorded live from the hangar deck of Niagara Falls' only Flying Saucer. [instrumental music] I'm Walter Bell, and, folks, as Lawrence Welk would say "It's wonderful, wonderful to be here." We've got a triple A gem of a show for you today. Alien lifeform approaching. Greetings, earthlings. - For two? - Yeah. Follow me. [instrumental music on stereo] Back in a chronon. So, what now? Maybe he's in the back. Abby! What? Ladies room is downstairs, honey, on the left. - Thanks. - Something for you, hon? [indistinct chatter] ...although maybe find a halfway peaceful spot below the Falls where you can spawn and die. It's a hard thing for any of us to imagine but it's what makes the salmon in this region so hard to catch and such a fine, rare treat to eat! El Viejo Seafood on Lundy's Lane has a half-price special on king and coho salmon every Tuesday. And if you ask me, that's a deal worth swimming upstream for. I'm Walter Bell, this is "Over the Falls" and until next time, eskonyen. Hey! Vancouver? Alex Moulin. Close the door. - What are you? - I'm just someone who saw it. What do you mean, saw it? Saw what? Saw them take him. - Oh, you would've been -- - I was seven! I was there when it happened, and I have proof. - Vancouver -- - No, I'm, I'm a local. The Rainbow Inn. Go back and order something. Eat, then walk two blocks East and look for a blue Toyota. And come alone. [instrumental music on stereo] Abby, we need to talk about some things. Like what? [chuckles] You don't trust me. I trust you not to set my house on fire. I don't always feel like you're telling me the truth. Alright, Laure, what can I do? You tell me? Alright. What happened in Toronto? Mum wouldn't tell me. Nothing happened. I -- Abby, the truth. Please. [music continues] I was freelancing. Doing pretty well, actually, and I met a guy. A really nice guy. What was his name? Daniel. Things got pretty serious, fast. And.. ...I started telling lies and then more lies. It all just got away from me.. ...as it always does. Everything turned to shit. So, I checked myself into a place for a couple of weeks and...then mum had her heart attack. That's it. Thank you. I know that wasn't easy. Yeah, yeah. Oof! I really gotta go. I'll see you? [dramatic music] I saw those two people force Alex into the trunk of their car, right where we first met. - Do you know them? - No. Open this. A bloody cap. One shoe. That's what I found. All I found. Does that say suicide to you? How did you get this? Not every bluecoat was in Charles II's pocket. Charles Lake II? Didn't you listen to the podcast? I mean.. I'm sorry. I mean, Alex was just a kid. What did he have to do with Charles Lake II? Nothing. The same can't be said for Charles III. Charlie? He took a special interest in Alex. You catch my drift? No, don't let that bon enfant routine fool you. Forgiving Charlie his trespasses was a regular cottage industry at CLC. How do you know this? Look up Donnie Mason. Two years before Alex. Like I said, it's not the first time. Probably won't be the last. And the Moulins? They must've known something was going on. Those two cockatiels? I don't think so. Ask yourself, cui prodest? Who profits? After losing Alex, the Moulins stopped performing. They got their pink slip. Meanwhile, CLC and their pervert prince continued to rule the roost. I've always had the motive. Now, here's the means and the opportunity. Track 'em down. You might be able to complete the picture. You keep it. Maybe you'll have better luck than I did. [dramatic music] Do you know what happens when a body hits the water at the bottom of the gorge? Think swallowing a live grenade. It's no longer a body you're looking for but pieces of a body. So, what makes the Alex Moulin case so special? Well, here was a boy, just like Donnie Mason before him who we're told leaped into the mighty gorge and vanished forever. Friends, I've fished corpses out of the Niagara for thirty years, so I can tell you there's always a piece of something. Take it from me.. ...this was no suicide. The savagery of the first Charles Lake is well-documented. And his son, Charles II well, he learned from the best. But Charles III had his eyes on something else entirely. Something depraved, even by his family's standards. As soon as he set his sights on Alex that boy was as good as gone. [music continues] I'm here to sell. You're not going to ask for shares or something now, are you? I'm not here to negotiate. You know, this usually goes through the lawyers. Well, I'm guessing they wrote it. So, I don't see why we need them. Signed on every page. Well, this is excellent. Excellent. This is impressive. Yeah. A lot of great memories up there. "BM." My favorite...right here. Rush. They performed for my 18th birthday. What about this one? This must have been before Alex disappeared. [sighs] That's what this is? I have a curious streak. Little bit of advice. I would stay away from the tinfoil hat-wearing crazies in this town. You can do a lot better than that. You're avoiding the question. Look, whatever you think you know.. ...trust me, you don't know anything. [whirring] [tiger roaring] BM.. [dramatic music] Abby! Abby! Shit! Come on out, Abby! Shit! [panting] [dramatic music] [breathing heavily] [people clamoring] [siren blaring] Jack the Ripper and Ted Bundy. [music continues] [indistinct chatter] Excuse me, please.. Excuse me. Excuse me. No. Excuse me. Excuse me, please. [cackling] Hey, you have to buy a ticket. Okay, here. [snarling] [woman screaming] Abby. Abby, Abby, Abby. Disappearing ink, really? You know I own the gag shop where you bought it. So, in case you haven't figured it out, I own this town. And when I'm done with you, Walter and all his crazies and your shitty little motel it's gonna be hilarious. So, if it's games you want to play with me, we can play 'cause this is really, really easy for me. [cackling] [gate creaks] Okay, first of all, a ticket is twelve dollars, I paid twenty. And second of all, I'm the new liaison at CLC. Soon to be. Ask Charlie. Mr. Lake's the one who called in the complaint. It's just a workplace misunderstanding. I'll talk to him. What exactly does a liaison for CLC do, Miss West? What does any liaison do. Look it up. Listen, ma'am, just stay away from CLC properties. And I'd stay away from Mr. Lake altogether. He didn't press charges this time but it's probably safe to say you didn't get the job. Have a good night, Miss West. [scoffs] [car engine starts] [knocking on door] - Hey, Abby. - Hey. Uh, yeah. Graveyard shift? Yeah. So.. I knew it! Bev Mole banned from the casino in 1996. That's her. How did you know she'd be in our system? A lucky guess. A Bev Mole won the lottery in June 1995. Bought 200 tickets. Who buys 200 tickets? Also, read that. "The good news couldn't have come at a better time. "During a botched home invasion last October "Mole's husband, Gerry, was violently assaulted paralyzing him from the waist down.." October? Maybe it was a double-cross. You guys having fun without me? Is this about that kidnapping? [dramatic music] [keypad beeping] [line ringing] We're sorry, your call cannot be completed as dialed. Call your operator to help you. Operator. How can I help you? Uh, hi, I've been trying to reach my aunt but her number isn't in service anymore. Could you put me through to the new one? Name and previous number? Uh, Beverly Mole. 9-0-5-555-0-1-7-3. Please hold. [line ringing] Hello? Uh...is this Beverly Mole? Who's asking? Uh, hi, Miss Mole. I'm from Customer Care at the Niagara Falls Casino. - Okay. - Uh, yeah, yeah. We noticed, uh, you haven't played with us in a while. We wanted to try and lure you back. Uh, we noticed there was an improper ban on your account.. ...and we'd like to give you a $100 credit and a room. What do you think? What do I have to do?

Police. What? Police! Oh. - She locked it. - Okay. I've got, gotta get you out of here. Thank you. Oh, shit. Okay. Okay, first.. ...I need you to tell me about Alex Moulin. Did Charles Lake send you? We took pictures. Polaroids. Of what? The scars. His scars. Scars you gave him? No. No, they don't like children. - Who don't? - Tigers. [coughs] Who don't? Tigers. [coughing] [inhales] We only wanted the money. The Moulins needed to pay for what they did to him. And after he died.. ...I tried to tell the police.. ...but my wife -- - She stopped you? - Yeah, she stopped me. [inhales sharply] The, the boy.. ...he was f -- fine when we left him. - Left him? - Yeah. Left him where? Ger! I can't help you right now. But I will. I promise. We're gettin' out of here. Fuckin' scam! Ger! We're leavin'! Fuck! Sorry, sweetness. I know we just got here. The casino tried to entrap me. Motherfuckers. Fuck! Aw, geez! We're leaving this fuckin' town. What a shit hole this is. Fuck! Come on. Come on, you fucker! Come on! [instrumental music] In the desert I saw a creature naked, bestial. Who, squatting on the ground, held her heart in her hands and ate of it! I said, "Is it good, friend?" "It is bitter, bitter," he answered. "But I like it because it is bitter, bitter. And because it is my heart." [tiger growling] [screams] [pounding on door] Abby! Abby! Abby, what's going on, kiddo? I got a call from the CLC lawyers. They're taking the motel, Abby. It doesn't matter whether you signed it in crayon, lipstick or invisible ink, it's binding! I've already talked to your sister. She sounded relieved, to be honest with you. Just take the money, kid. Get your life sorted. Did mom really want to sell this place? - Abby.. - Just tell me. She's dead. Just tell me. I can tell you that once the decision was made she was at peace with it. That much I can tell you. [dramatic music] [fireworks crackling] [people cheering in distance] [snarling] Aww. [indistinct chatter] Isn't she beautiful? The Moulins were forcing Alex to be in their act. With the tigers. But there was a terrible accident so they locked him up and they hid him away. But Bev Mole, the animal trainer she was the only outsider who knew. Does that name mean anything to you? Nope. Well, Bev decides to take pictures of a scarred-up Alex and uses them to blackmail the Moulins. Everything goes according to plan until Alex somehow breaks free and runs away. So, Bev's complicit in all this and she's forced to track him down and take him back to the Moulins but then he's never heard from again. - Bye, Walter. - Goodnight, darlin'. Alien life-form approaching. So, what are you implying? The Moulins killed their own kid. The abuse, the tiger attack, the blackmail -- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Cui prodest, right? Bev Mole and the Moulins are bound. It's been a cold war ever since. I thought you were a smart kid. I thought your eyes were open. "Complete the picture." That's what this is. It isn't some dubious campaign against the Lake family. You think you know these people. [scoffs] I've seen you driving by my motel. Snooping around. You're paranoid. Don't you mean CLC's motel? Or maybe you just forgot to mention your pending land deal. Goodbye. [exhales sharply] [dramatic music] Fuck!

We've got Chernobyl of dirt on her compared to that. - Can I get anybody something? - No, fuck off! That woman stole from us. Blackmailed us, she almost ruined our careers! Not to mention, kidnapped your son. She didn't send you? ¶ You'll need a friend ¶ ¶ But there won't be.. ¶¶ Keep it. I have the originals. Well, how much? I don't want money. I want the truth. [laughs] Truth. You're pretty smart, huh? But what you're doing here is fucking dopey. But I'll admit, you do it with a certain exuberance. You're stalling. [sighs] - The truth. - The truth. The truth. The truth is.. ...we don't know. We paid her the money. The deal was she would take him back to the farm. But he never got there. We went to the police. They told us he committed suicide. They didn't want to listen to us! Now, that chicken hawk Charles Lake.. ...was trying to send us a message. The police and that bitch Beverly.. ...they were all on the payroll. - What message? - He took my boy. Mon bebe. Mon petit garcon. [tape recorder clicks] [sighs] The truth. He was there.. ...tied up in his little cage. Half-conscious. And we saw an opportunity. We tried to teach Alex, tried to include him. But he was spoiled, soft. Tigers bow to strength. Fear only makes them salivate. It was really his fault more than the tiger's. It could have sent him over the cliff. The body breaks up on the rocks. The sad child does what sad children do. [laughs] I'll have some coffee please, now. Thank you. Feels good to get that off our chest, doesn't it, boy? Yeah. There you have it, the truth.. ...and a lie. You have to decide which is which. More homework, I'm afraid. [laughs] Huh. Don't be embarrassed, honey. Don't. [sniffles] It's smoke and mirrors, by the way, the trick. [humming] [dramatic music] We drop a mirror between Heka and the audience. A little redirection a little light. Go ahead.. ...tell someone. See if they believe you. Now scram. Scram! [intense music] Hey, whoa, whoa. Slow down. Oh, sorry. How long were you in the States? Just a day. [music continues] Abby, this is, uh, strictly voluntary. Your sister has graciously agreed to take you in for the time being. However, I think you owe her an explanation as to what you were doing with her passport. It's okay, Abby. My sister has these, uh, cycles. Laure, do you know what your sister was doing before she came back home? She mentioned something about bumming around Toronto with a, a boyfriend and fucking that all up, or.. What is this? That is Abby's last cycle. She was in Phoenix, Arizona, the last eighteen months claiming that she had retrograde amnesia. Do you know what that is? It's when you hit your head and lose all memory of anything that happened before the injury. She convinced people she didn't know who she was. Her name, her family, anything. People thought that she'd escaped some human trafficking ring. And then a local caseworker made Abby his pet cause trying to get the state to issue her an ID. It was a bit of a story down there. The press dubbed her "Jane of the Desert." And then once she got exposed it got pretty messy, as you can imagine. Lawyers, psychiatrists, meds. The deportation. She was banned from ever going back into the United States. And it was your mom who came to her rescue. Mom? - She -- she paid for all this? - Yes. With a loan against the sale of the motel. Why didn't she tell me? Because she was afraid it was going to tear the two of you apart, permanently. This had a real cost on your mom. Abby.. You are my sister and I love you, despite everything. Just, just look me in the eye and tell me you did this. That's all. I got them, Laure. They told me. Who? Who told you what? The Moulins. No, Abby, we are not, we are not doing this. So you don't believe any of this now? Just -- just tell me you'll get help I will be there the whole way. They laid it all out for me. They -- they told me how they killed him and why. It's means, motive, opportunity! - Stop it! Stop it! - The Moulins! You have to bring them in for questioning! The Moulins? I thought Alex was -- was whacked by some evil consortium -- Laure, I -- I got the whole story, Laure! I'm sure it's very interesting. But it -- it just doesn't add up. Abby, why can't you just admit what you did in Phoenix? Because I'm not.. [sighs] Because I was protecting myself. [scoffs] I'm not a liar. Laure.. I'm not. [sobbing] [dramatic music] [indistinct chatter] [music continues] Well, it seems to me that under the circumstances that you have a perfect right. You do? Well, I wouldn't want to do it without a witness. - Well, that's me. - It is? Well, that's all I wanted to know. Try and look in that thing.. [dramatic music] [music continues] [light switch clicks] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] Alright. Bye, babe. See ya. [door closes] [doorknob clicks] [music continues] [indistinct chatter on TV] [coughing] - Ah! - Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Calm down. Calm down. It's okay. Don't panic, please. I just want to talk to you. Okay. And I want to show you something. Look at these. Look.. I need you to look at these, please. You remember that day? - This is me. - I don't -- Look. Look, please! - You see? - Hm. You remember this day? Um.. You want to make it right again? I do. I just.. Yeah. - I can get you out of here. - Hm. But I need you to do something for me. Yeah. You understand? Ndio, kwe and yineh to the "Over the Falls" podcast. Recorded live from the hangar deck of Niagara's only Flying Saucer. I'm Walter Bell. And, folks, as Lawrence Welk would say "It's wonderful, wonderful to be here." [door thuds] Get the fuck out of my house! [groaning] [breathing heavily] We have a very special episode for you today. Our long-time listeners will surely know why. For over 20 years, I've been telling the police that Charles Lake II had Alex Moulin murdered all to protect his son current CLC boss Charles III. And his elicit taste for young, vulnerable boys. We fought a long and bloody battle to bring retribution to this criminal clan. So, today, I'm proud to say we are on the cusp of victory. This sleepy neighborhood in the suburban town of Ajax forty-five minutes outside of Toronto was shaken by the sounds of a police raid as officers charged into this bungalow behind me. Inside, 58-year-old retiree, Beverly Mole was arrested for the forcible confinement and suspected torture of her physically-disabled husband. However, when police talked to the victim fifty-one-year-old Gerry Mole he dropped a bombshell no one saw coming. According to Gerry, his wife was the hired gun for a ghastly crime that took place almost 25 years ago. A crime she committed on behalf of the now-deceased Niagara Falls tycoon Charles Lake II. A crime that, until now wasn't even a crime at all. Who could have fathomed such a fate for young Alex? Tortured by his parents, defiled by a deviant then fed to a den of tigers like some ritual slaughter. Truly, this was a masterpiece of degeneracy. We did not know about the abuse. We certainly did not know about his murder. We intend to fight this gross, malicious slander. Someone who was willing to comment was this man Walter Bell who many in the region would recognize as a member of the local daredevil and water rescue team, The Diving Bells. Walter was a part of the original search-party that scoured the Niagara River for any evidence of Alex Moulin's remains. According to Walter, something seemed off immediately. Of course, Alex wasn't the first. We've only started to scratch the surface on the story believe me. Uh, I also have a podcast. It's called "Over the Falls." As we await the outcome of this re-opened investigation I remind my listeners of our long fight for justice against nepotism, beguiling iniquity and bloodshed. To everyone that stuck with us thus always to tyrants. [instrumental music] Can I help you? Yeah. You have a room? Uh.. How many nights? Uh, don't know yet. [keys clacking] I have a room. I just need your driver's license and credit card. Yeah. Um, I only have cash. Okay. Do you have any ID? [printer whirring] - How much? - A hundred-dollar deposit. Vancouver. Yeah. - It's a long way from home. - Hm. First time in Niagara Falls? Um.. First time in a long time. What brings you back? Do we know each other? No. Huh. You know.. ...he's not lying. He never hurt that kid? No. Saved his life. That mine? Oh, yeah. Thanks, Abby. ¶ Sometimes ¶ ¶ I get so lonely ¶ ¶ Sometimes ¶ ¶ I feel so blue ¶ ¶ Sometimes ¶ ¶ My heart grows weary ¶ ¶ All because ¶ ¶ Of you ¶ ¶ Sometimes ¶ ¶ I feel so hollow ¶ ¶ Crying ¶ ¶ The whole night through ¶ ¶ Oh love ¶ ¶ That I can call my own ¶ ¶ All because ¶ ¶ Of you ¶ ¶ I want to be your baby ¶ ¶ I want you to hold me so tight ¶ ¶ I want you to love me ¶ ¶ Always think of me ¶ ¶ Everyday and every night ¶ ¶ Someday ¶ ¶ Someday you'll come to me ¶ ¶ And love me ¶ ¶ As I love you ¶ [humming] [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues]
