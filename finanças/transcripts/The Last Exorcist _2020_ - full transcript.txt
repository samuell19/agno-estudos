Until we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of His hands. Demon, stop, demon! God compels you, out! The power of God compels you! The power of God compels you! Science, science would like to explain this away as if it were a mental illness. But what, may I ask, is mental illness? Is it simply a medically-diagnosed psychiatric disorder? Or nothing more than a behavior pattern that can cause extreme anguish or suffering? Or, perhaps mental illness is something far more sinister, such as an invasion of the devil himself into the human experience. What we do know, is that mental illness can be a genetic disorder, one that is passed on through generations in families that are affected. Hospital staff were unable to diagnose this patient. Ironically, a visiting maintenance worker recognized signs of demonic possession and advised doctors to seek an exorcist. As one can imagine, this advice was not well-received. This dark shadow is not trick photography. This dark shadow is not that of Photoshop. This photo has not been altered in any way. This man is dead. He's dead because of the evil workings of the devil himself. Let me pose this question to you. Might the passing of demonic possession also be a generational issue passed on through families? I've performed hundreds of exorcisms in the last 30 years, and in my experience, most of these demonic possessions have been isolated incidents. I've isolated to certain individuals who lacked faith, who lived life without honor or integrity, leaving a gateway for evil to enter their souls. When dealing with the power of evil, there is no... Holy shit! Lord, I awake and see Your light for you have kept me through this night. And to you I lift my hands and pray. Keep me free from sin throughout this day. And if I die before it's done, save me through Jesus Christ, Your son. Maddie? Maddie, are you home? Maddie, Maddie, Maddie, Maddie. Wake up, please. I just had a really bad dream. Something bad happened to Father Peter. Please. Oh my god, my god. Tragedy struck today during a documentary film shoot in Vatican City. The Catholic Church was quoted saying that this was a groundbreaking interview with one of the few remaining exorcists in the world, Father Peter Campbell, of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Sadly, there were no survivors. Authorities are speculating that this may have been a terrorist attack. However, members of the church are - refuting that notion. - No, no! Indeed, this incident does beg the question, is the Catholic Church dying? Maddie, Maddie, please! Lord, those who die still live in Your presence. Our lives change, but do not end. Josephine. You shouldn't be in here. I'm sorry, it's just... Father Peter loved you more than you can imagine, Josephine. He is with you, he will always be with you. Are you serious? Uh yeah. I'm cooking up Father Peter's favorite steak in remembrance of him. Doesn't it smell good? No, no, it honestly doesn't smell good at all. It doesn't even look edible, Maddie. You know, you need some blood of Christ. Oh. Maddie, how can you even be like this? I feel like I can't breathe. I mean, Father Peter's gone. We're never going to see him again. We don't have anybody. We've nobody, we've no family. How can you say that? We have each other. We have always had each other. We're lucky, we are so blessed that we had Father Peter in our lives for the time that we did. Now, can we please talk about something happy, because you're a real buzzkill right now. Remember when, oh my gosh, you were so young. You were so cute! And you were so scared to go into Sister Catherine's room because... Oh my gosh, do you remember that? We thought there was something living under her bed. And then you even named it. Vincent! Vincent was real, though, Maddie. See? Happy memories Yeah. Yeah. And by the way, I knew that you were making that whole thing up just so that we didn't have to - sleep in the convent. - No way, no I didn't. Vincent was very, very real, okay? Very real. But yeah, maybe I didn't really wanna sleep in the convent either, so... I was so thankful. You and me? We're gonna get through this together, right? Hell yeah! Maddie. I'm sorry, yes. Yes, of course, we will get through this together. I love you, sister. I love you, sister. With everything. Okay, so this looks good. It's ready. Whoever did this to Father Peter, they need to pay big time. I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you. Father Peter was a friend of mine, also. May I sit? You know, we used to serve hot meals at the mission with Father Peter. I've never seen you. It's very kind of you to serve the community. You were a priest. That was a lifetime ago. Wait, I think I've heard about you. You're Father Marco? Father Peter told me about you and how you abandoned the church when... It was really hard for you. Yes, indeed it was. This place hasn't changed. Garden needs a little tending to. You have a cell phone? Uh, yeah. Take my number. No, I don't think so, buddy. Um. You're going to need it. What, what for? I knew your mother. When Father Peter died, I felt compelled to get in touch with both of you. Just give me your phone, trust me. Why should she trust you? How did you know our mother? Look, here, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine. What are you thinking? Keep in touch. That's the stupidest thing I've ever seen you do. You need to slow down, girl. Wanna refill? No thanks. Hey look, I'm sure you're sick of hearing about it but I'm sorry about Father Peter. Thank you. Shit, you can't even go into a church no more without worrying about being blown the fuck up. Oh, sorry. That wasn't cool. Jo! Jo, baby girl, it's all right. It's okay, you're good, you're good. Take a deep breath. Okay, Hector, help me, I need you to take her to the back room, all right? She needs to lay down for a little bit. You're gonna be all right, baby girl. All right, everybody, go back to what you were doin'. Next round is on me and I'm first. Father Peter, I need you and Father Marco. It's my wife. The devil's inside her. Tricia, don't hurt the child, please! What do you care? She's not your blood! I'm not hurting your baby. She's just a child. No she's not, she's just some dumb slut. Get away from me, you bitch! What, what did you say? I know what kind of girl you are. I learned it from you. Shut up! No! I hate you, I hate you! My Father in heaven, please help me understand the deeper meaning behind my suffering. I gotta go pee. Hi, big Daddy. Will you take over for me? Mm, yum! Oh, god damn it! Oh damn. I'm jacked up. Girlfriend, you are a mess. No! I know what kind of girl you are. I called you some dumb slut. Slut! Slut! Fuck. ♪ I will go Lord if you lead me ♪ ♪ I will hold your people in your heart. ♪ "The name of the Lord is a strong tower. "The righteous man who runs into it is safe." They then heard voices saying whom shall I send. Who will go for us? Here I am. Send me. Everything I taught you, everything you learned about the dark side will come into fruition. Take from my teachings. I hear you, Father. Boo! Oh, Maddie, sorry I wasn't expecting you. Yeah, I can see that. I'm just here picking up something from Sister Catherine. Right. Maddie, I heard him. Who? Father Peter, he spoke to me. He spoke to you? Yes. Like from the dead? I heard him. That's typical, since he loved you more. You know that's not true. Yeah, whatever. Anyways, I gotta go. This place, I hate it here. Why would you say that? This is our home, we grew up here. This is not my home. Bless me Father for I have sinned. It has been eight months since my last confession. I accuse myself of the following sin. I have had terrible thoughts about my sister. Father Peter has been preparing me for what he called the evil to enter into my life, but I never, I just never thought it would be her. I believe that evil has entered into her body and she's not in her right mind. Father Andrew? Help, help, help! Please, somebody help me out! Help, help, help, help! Josephine. Are you okay? Father Andrew? Where were you? I was just calling for you. I was conducting a memorial service this afternoon. May I assist you with something? Perhaps you've fallen ill? I have to go. So, I see you've experienced an increased number of epileptic seizures. Yeah, I've just been having a lot more seizures lately, and really vivid dreams about my childhood. I've even been hearing voices, like evil voices. And I'm scared. Any drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, vomiting? Um, no, I just... You know what, I can up the dose of your medication. That should help. I've missed you, Josephine. Excuse me. Are ya gonna survive? No. Oh, it's probably just side effects from meds. It's gonna be okay, I got you. I've got you. Have you been drinking? It's happy hour somewhere in the world. No, okay sister, don't go there. I'm a grown woman, I can have a shot of tequila, or two or three, if I want to at lunch. Okay? You're the one hearing voices. Maybe you need a cocktail. I don't know what the big deal is. You know what the big deal is. Really? Of course. Sweetie, I got you something. Thank you, Mommy. Did you get anything for me? The Lord will command his angels to take good care of you. Mommy, Mommy! Mommy, Mommy, Mommy! Mommy! As long as you know that God is for you, it doesn't matter who is against you. Romans 8:31. This was Father Peter's favorite verse. We are lucky to have such a witness to Father Peter's kindness and virtuosity here tonight. Miss Josephine McManus. Hi, um, when my sister and I were little, we tragically lost our parents and were left as orphans. Father Peter took us into his loving arms and taught us the teachings of the church. In my Father's house are many rooms. If it were not so, why would I say I go to prepare a place for you? John 14:2. You may not remember me, but I remember you. Father Peter spoke to us about this when he - spoke to us about death. - Ian, you ready? The babysitter needs to be home by nine. - And so I say to you... - Let's go then. Father Peter, you are not dead. You are just in another room. Thank you. Asshole! Excuse me. We have to go. Maddie, stop, Maddie stop! We're free, we're free! Remember when we were in that shitty group home and we kept trying to run away? We're free! Remember? Right before Mom died, she was drinking a lot. Maybe the bitch was onto something. Well, you're going down the same path. What did you say? I said, you're a drunk. Do not compare me to that woman! What are you doing? - What are you doing? - How dare you! - Get off of me. - How dare you! There's a reason why my dad wanted nothing to do with her. And a reason why your dad is six feet under. And it had nothing to do with alcohol. Little sister, I had no idea you had that in you. Who started the fire? Who started the fire? Don't touch me. I don't know, I don't know. Yes you do. I don't know. Who started the fire? Jesus, you really need to loosen up. And I gotta get back to work. The bar's calling. You wanna join me? I'll buy ya a soda. No. Fine. Are you gonna come? Because I can't just leave you here, in an alley, by yourself. What are you, a lunatic? Sister! Sister! Let go! Don't touch me. I'll touch you all I want. When I was a child, I thought as a child, and I acted as a child. But when I became a man, it was time to put away childish things. Harder! Go! ♪ When the sun's in the west ♪ ♪ I remember the best ♪ ♪ I'm longing for Tulsa and you ♪ ♪ We danced to those tunes ♪ ♪ From June back to June ♪ ♪ I'm crazy for Tulsa and you ♪ Why, thank you very much You're kinda cute. I think you should motorboat me. It's my lucky night. Why don't you back the fuck off. You wanna come up here and dance with me? Yes. Oh, we got ourselves a show up in here. Guys, you're missing it. Fun time! I know what kind of girl you are. You get off me! Get away from me! Fucking bitch! What is wrong with you? You want crazy, I'll give you fucking crazy. You almost killed her! What the fuck? Hector, he's trying to hurt me! What are you looking at? You stay away from me, stay away! Mommy! Mommy! No! It's okay, it's okay. Ssh, it's okay, Jo. Be strong and have courage. You are loved and the Lord has special plans for you. Special, special plans for you. Sh, it's okay, we're here. We're here for you. Sister Catherine, what are you doing here? We must pray. Madeline has fallen very ill. What, what, what happened, where is she? Please, Josephine, we must look to God for answers. God, our Eternal Father, You are the salvation for those who believe in You. Hear us for your sick servant, Madeline. Through Jesus Christ, our Lord, amen. The police have Madeline on a psychiatric hold. They need you down at the station. Let's get you dressed. Why do we have to put everything in trash bags? Because we have to leave, fast. Take your bag? Better not separate us. Let's go. Josephine, you look so distressed. Why are you moving so fast? Is there something I can assist you with? Didn't Sister Catherine tell you? Maddie's in the hospital. No, she didn't tell me. I haven't even seen her. You must go. Pray first, then go. Thank you, thank you. Father Peter, if you can hear me, please, please guide me with your light. I sentence you to the of hell! To your Lord that's never Get out! Be gone, I command you to come out of this woman, you demon of hell! Be gone! Come out, come out, come out! Now in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord! This will not only confirm your faith. It will be a reminder to you that I'm always with you. Please don't ever leave me. I'm assuming that this news is going to be fairly upsetting to you. However, I must tell you that even though we have not officially diagnosed Madeline, we suspect that it's paranoid schizophrenia. Madeline is also experiencing severe alcohol withdrawal, which is simply adding to her agitation. - She's hurting herself. - Wait, wait, wait! She's hurting others, so we put her on a 48-hour hold. Hi, hi sister. With her family history, I'm afraid that this is likely to develop into a serious problem. Please, please help me. Please. - Take this off me! - I'm here, I'm here. It hurts so bad. Make them take them off. Could you bring me, baby, my tequila. 'Cause it'll help me. Sister, sister? Everybody loves Jo Jo. Everybody loves Jo Jo. Jo Jo girl. She's afraid. Ah, you're ugly and stupid! Only stupid people believe in God! Who are you? Don't be silly, it's your mama. Come give your mama a hug, baby girl. Don't get too close to her. She's just some dumb slut! Somebody help! Please let me out, please let me out! Somebody please, please let me out! Please let me out! Somebody please help me, please! Don't leave me! Please, please let me out, please! Please, please! Wow, you're so pretty. You're an angel from heaven. I'm so sorry, I didn't realize you were in the room. I accidentally locked you in. Can I get you a water or something? No, I'm good thanks. I understand what you're going through. My mother was very ill. She was in and out of these places her entire life. Really? It's heartbreaking. I'm so sorry that you're going through this. You were lucky though. You grew up around people that cared about you. You had a family in your sister. I was left alone in a group home. Me too. Me and Maddie, we grew up in group homes and foster homes ever since I was seven and she was 13. We had the same mom, but different dads. I knew I saw compassion in your eyes. Only someone who's experienced childhood trauma can truly understand the importance of family. If it's any consolation, I will keep an extra eye on your sister, just to make sure she's doing okay and that she has everything she needs. I would really appreciate that. I'm Daniel. - I'm J- - Josephine Sabrina McManus. I know. I love you. You are so stupid! You slut! Can I help you? Thank you, that's nice of you. You're welcome. 1743 Cypress Tree Lane. Lady, lady, wake up! Wake up! You okay, lady? Do you need a hospital? You wanna go to the address or the hospital? The spirit of God, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Most holy trinity, angels, archangels, use me, use me! Come, Josephine. The pureness of this child draws out the evil within, it draws you out. You are a child, pure as she is. Burn in hell. And take that poker with you. Oh, it doesn't bite. Um, I'm looking for Marco Baez? I'm sorry, I think I'm in the wrong place. Marco Baez, he lives next door, sweetheart. Wow, you're so pretty. Like an angel from heaven. Marco! You made it. There he is. Everyone that does evil hates the light. They won't go into it, for fear that their deeds will be exposed. I feel like I've been here before. Where? The pond, the dirt path. I don't know. Father Peter may have brought you here once or twice. He did. I remember. I remember this dark, dark room at the bottom of these concrete stairs. There was glass and blood all over. Yes, that's right. Maddie needs purification. Father Peter has been preparing me for this my whole life. That is why he sent you to me. Performing an exorcism properly, not only requires that you be a priest, it also requires that you accept the darkness inside you. And that which is in your sister. I don't believe you're ready. I don't get it. This isn't about me. Please, please, just help me do for my sister what you couldn't do for my mother. I was there the night your mother killed herself. I know. Your mother died because she was sick. I'm not sure there was anything that Peter and I could have done to change that. It was her fate. Look, after Peter's passing, I just came by to see if you and your sister were okay. That's it. That's not it. You came because you saw a demon enter Maddie's soul the night my mom died. I know you saw it. I know you did because I did too. I remember you, Marco. The time has come. Peter warned us of this day. And I never thought I'd live to see it. I'm an old man, you can't do this to me. My heart won't take it. Please, please help me. You must be a man. Only a man can enter the seminary. You must become a deacon, and only then become a priest. The Catholic Church has protocols. All these years, I've been told that Jo was a boy. You know this can't happen. Gently, gently, gently. All right, all right. Father! I abandon myself into Your hands. Do with me whatever You will. And whatever You do, I thank You. God has spoken. Lord, I awaken to your light, for you have kept me through the night. And to you I lift my hands and pray, keep me from sin throughout this day. And if I die before it's done, save me through Jesus Christ, Your son. We are here to celebrate the ordination of one woman into the sacred priesthood of Jesus Christ. Josephine Sabrina McManus, thanks be to God. Please don't ever leave me. Do you promise to respect and obey me and my successors? I do. Sweetie, I got you something. Thanks, Mommy! And may the good work that God has begun in you be brought to fulfillment. Here, you hold this cross and we'll pray. Lord, I awake and see Your light, for You have kept me through this night. And to You I lift my hands and pray. Keep me from sin throughout this day. And if I die before it's done, save me through Jesus Christ, Your son. Blessed be God, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Hallelujah, Christ is risen. Bless the Lord who forgives all our sins. Hallelujah. Thank you. Now first off, make sure she gets plenty of rest. And if she starts complaining about visions or delusions, you give her two of those yellow pills. Now I'll be in touch in, I'd say, a week or so, and we can get together and we can talk about long-term care in conjunction with her alcohol rehabilitation. Okay, thank you. Where are we going? This isn't how we get home. We're not going home. We're never going there again. Oh my God, please reach down and surround Madeline with supernatural peace and strength. Protect her from Satan's lies and discouragement, and let her miraculous healing begin, amen. Amen. Oh, please help my sister. Why are you letting them do this to me? Shut the fuck up, you old man! You fucked my sister, you pervert! You may begin, Josephine. Sister, why are you letting them do this to me? Let us pray. Almighty and everlasting God, our Father in heaven, - hallowed be Thy name. - Stop. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. - Lord, let us pray. - I'm gonna die. Oh Lord. Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Sister, please, let me out of here, please. We're family, please, please stop. Today, Lord, I do not come to You for myself. Today, Lord, I come to You for my sister. Lord, please bless my sister. Let her be, I'll fuck you up. We fucked you. Jo, don't listen to her. It's not your sister talking. It's not your sister! Please, please help us. You are a person of faith. Focus on the power of God. Today, Lord, I do not come to You for myself. Today, Lord, I come to You for my sister. Oh please God, she is the most important person to me in my life. Please don't take her away from me! Please, please, Father Marco help. You can do this. You can do this. Father, please give me strength. Josephine, they're trying to distract you. Do not focus on the manifestation of evil. Josephine, Josephine, Josephine. You're stronger than you know. Focus on the power within you. I've missed you, Josephine. I've missed you, Josephine. I've missed you, Josphine. Come give your mama a hug, baby girl. Mommy, mommy, where are you? Mommy? Josephine, they're trying to distract you. Do not focus on the manifestation of evil. Father Peter told you you had epilepsy. He told you this to protect you from the truth. Every seizure you had was the work of demons trying to enter your soul. Why would Father Peter let me think I was sick my whole life? Why? He feared if he told you the truth, it would be an entry point for demons to come into your life. I accept the truth of my past, and I forgive those who hurt me. I forgive you for hurting me, Mommy. You know what to do, Josephine. Do it! Do it! Do it! Go to your sister, Josephine. We only have a short time. This isn't over. Maddie, Maddie, I know you're in there. Please, please hear me, sister, I love you. Sister please, you're the most important person in my life, please don't leave me. The time is now, Josephine. Close the door on evil. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Oh God of peace, subdue Satan beneath our feet. Oh God of peace, subdue Satan beneath our feet. I love you, sister! Sister, I love you, you're my everything! Sister, please. What happened? Is she okay? Sister? Sister? Jo. Maddie? Jo. Hi, Jo. Jo. You saved me! Where are we? Why are you wearing Father Peter's robe? Is he still here? Father Peter is always with us. He's just in another room. In my Father's house there are many rooms. If it were not so, would I not have told you that I go there to prepare a place for you. No more tears now, my little Jo. Go my faith with you. I'm always with you. I'm just in another room. What man of you, if your son asks you for a loaf of bread, would give him a stone? Or a fish and give him a serpent? If you, then, who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, so how much more so would your Father who is in heaven, know how to give good gifts to all those who ask Him? Amen. Amen!
