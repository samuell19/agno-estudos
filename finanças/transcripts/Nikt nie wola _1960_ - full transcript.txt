For peace... Peace. Right now I'm peaceful. I finished the war. But they are... I can't live at the roofs forever. NOBODY'S CALLING Lucyna! Lucy! Ala! Alice, come here! Lucyna! ...Candidates for the pedagogic course! Get off! Stay in this town, people! There's a lot of work and apartments! Stay in this town, people! Everyone's needed in here! Water! Water! Lucy, water! - It was the last bottle. - You shouldn't behave like this! - Why? - Because! Hey! Give me some water. No, water please! Thank you! Hey! Let's get in, huh? No! - Don't you register? - I'm not a repatriate. When I'll be a bigwig in here, call me! OK! - Soon I'll become a mayor! - Good luck! Hey! The naughty one! They won't find me in here. They can't find me. They can't find some Nieczuja. I'll nail a card with my name on the door. They'll nose around. I was nosing around about Kauleiter for three months, till I found out. About the aide-de-camp. What a hovel. If they come, they'll come at night. Two men. Why should I shoot at the red ones? Would they pick on me then? Naive dreams, gentlemen. We're in Zielno. Hello! Where are you going? To the countryside! To trade? No, I want to get something to eat! - Buy something for me too! - Fine! Some potatoes! Something that you buy for yourself. - Is that yours? - That? - Yes! - Yeah, it's mine. Don't you like it? - Couldn't you find something better? - No-one will show interest in it. It's peaceful. It will collapse, aren't you afraid? I'm not afraid of anything. I feel fine. - Will you clean it up? - Yes. I used to do it at home. - Can you cook? - Uh-huh. Deal. You'll get a meal. Eat it and leave something for me. - The identity card? - It burnt during the uprising. - The two witnesses? - They will be. There're lots of witnesses in this world. - What can you do? - Nothing. There's no office work. Barrel making, press maintenance, loading and unloading of the resources. So? I'm a man. Since not far ago, I guess. Go to Ms Starenska, the first floor. - Next. - Biel Stanislaw. Good morning. Good morning. Hello. Name! My name is Bohdan Nieczuja. Bogdan? Bohdan. I call everyone by their first name. It's nice to meet you. - A bachelor! - One, at least. Go load the barrels. Are you sure you are fitted to this job? To every job, madam. She's got their eyes. Why do you care what was my name. It's the past, now I'm Nieczuja, is it enough? How are you, mayor? Like a stone by the road. Water is useless. At last. - Were you waiting? - Out of habit. We used to wait with the supper for father. - Did you eat? - No. I'm starving. I prepared a big thing - borsch. It's my national dish. I want to eat! Get up, you'll get cold! Won't your sister be surprised you'll be back so late? Why don't you yell at me? - Isn't she mad at you when you're back late? - She trusts me. What will you do? Go to sleep at once? I don't know. We've no books, so we'll tell stories. - About what? - What we'd like to eat, sew, how mean men are. - What can you know about it? - Much more than you think. If you're to be bored in the dorm, stay here. We'll sleep together. - Is it a bad offer? - Yes. It isn't cosy and there are bedbugs in here. - Won't you stay? - No. - No? - Can I take these? Thank you. Get lost! Do you have a needle and a piece of thread? - I ordered but they didn't bring it. - To hell with them. Strong, isn't it? No. Try them on. Nobody ever paid for something for me. They aren't too tough. You're very extravagant with your money. I'll have more cash. Our manageress keeps an eye on me. - Take the opportunity, then. - She's quite pretty, she'll give us a lot of money. - Congratulations. - I'll try to help you and your sister! God bless you. Bozek. You know what morality is. No. - If I were you, I would be more consistent. - In what? In roguery. It requires effort, it isn't worth it. Maybe some other reasons matter? I'll tell her. Let her advise something. Is it something evil? Maybe. Why are you like that? Is it a secret? Can I kiss you? - Why did you do it? - Why did you do it?! - For fun. - That's not true, it's because I changed my hairstyle! Don't see me home, leave me alone! Take care of your manageress, she'll give you lots of money! How are things? It's still getting worse. Water is useless. Bozek! Bozek, turn off the water! Bozek, you're pale. You're pining away, boy. Nobody cares about you, nobody cooks for you or does the washing. You'd better look for a good, ordinary girl. You need some warmth. You're a great girl, Niura. Give me the comb. What an idea, to come at this time! - I have to talk to you. - Go away! - I'll turn away. - Wait outside. Girls! THE EMILIA PLATER'S TWO-YEAR PEDAGOGIC COURSE DORMITORY Bozek. - You're a fool. - Why? What do you see in Lucyna? She is relentless, steadfast, flawless and obviously - unmatched. Bozek, come here. I'm completely different. If it was for me... Why didn't you come? The pumps fell to pieces. I thought you bore me a grudge. - What? - I thought you bore me a grudge. What are you doing? I won't take anything from you. I'm not giving you anything. VETERANS' CIRCUS Listen, Lucyna. But don't interrupt me. Why wouldn't you live with me? I'll earn enough money for both of us, I'll try to get a better apartment. You'll still be able to learn, why not. - We'll take care of Alice too. - How is Ms Starenska? If you want to make it formal, certainly - let's get married. - It's very reasonable. - Do you agree? No. I'm not reasonable. - I'll be good for you. - No doubt. - I would rarely betray you. - How often? Once a month. That's bearable. How about me? Well, you'll have the right to do it too. In a modern way? A relationship of free people, without restrictions. - Will we exchange the impressions in the mornings? - So? We promised with girls that we will never get married. Just say it - you wait for someone else. There's a guy messing around in the dorm. You gave him your word and you wait, right? And if it's true? I'm sorry. No is no. I wish you luck. You've silly ideas. Actually, I wanted to kiss you. I really wanted to. I still want to. Don't be afraid, it won't happen again. I'm going. - Go on, kiss me. - No. I'm going. I'm going, damn it! What do you want from me? I don't need you at all! I'll find a hudred girls like you! I wish you luck, madam! Water is... useless. [?] You've an ear for music, Bozek. Do you know they opened a cinema? - I know. There's a Leslie Howard film. - I'm going to the last showing. I'll try to be there. Later we'll drink cognac in my place. We'll eat something. What do you like to eat? Borsch. You're funny. - Do you like chicken? - Everyone likes them. But do chicken like us? Come, Niura. Good morning. Good morning! Good morning! Good morning. CINEMA Excuse me. Well, Starenska's quite pretty. Two ice-creams. Starenska's not too bad. - You shouldn't think it over for long. - Drop it. It's not good that she saw us. You'll loose her favours. That's fine. - What? - That's fine. The things you say are pointless. You know what morality is. What are you laughing at? Bozek! You're alive! They're here. God, they're here. Zygmunt's here. Zygmunt? Who is he? - You came here... - I came here to look around and... What are your intentions? Jula is going to deliver a child again. My throat is worse. It's suspicious. What are your intentions?! Zygmunt... Zygmunt's here, Zygmunt's here... No! Why is she in this mess. I have to do something. She... She doesn't understand anything. I'll tell her everything. I have to do something. Kiss me. The railway station. The roof is the safest place. How are you, mayor? Man's happiness is what he's been through. Water is useless. Bozek. Do you have money? I'll cook a dinner for you. I'll move in to your place. We'll get married. - I mustn't marry you. - You don't like me anymore? You don't even ask what I've done. - Everything has changed. - It's not true. I thought I would get away from them. What do they want from me? - What have you done? - They told me to kill. That's what I haven't done. It was in conflict with my sense of justice. That's funny. I've got scruples. I don't regret it. I love you. You've never told me this. Really? Never. You told me that I'd be fine, that you'll earn money for both of us, that you'll change the apartment. Such things. Now you know. Now I know. - Bozek. - What? What are you thinking about? I have to go away. Will you go? No. Are you getting married, Bozek? He's crazy. What are your intentions? I'm settling down in here too. I got a job in trade. I have to start living normally. I have a sore throat. I'm going to an end. Jula's going to have a child. Do you know something? Flee. No way. - And if they come here? - We will see. What will happen to the girl? Bozek, don't get married. I don't want to end it in a stupid way. She. Why is she in this mess. She. I won't go without Lucyna. Bozek. - What are you going to do tomorrow? - I'll go to work. - And later? - I'll come home. - And later? - You'll come. - I won't come tomorrow. - So you won't come. - Why are you in a bad mood? - I'll curse. I'll curse everyone and everything. You don't love me. I know it's hard to put up with me. No. I'm fed up with this. I can't stay here any longer. I have to find another place. I've been thinking about it long ago. Apparently you are sick of me. I don't want you to live like this. - Niura wants to give up a room to me. - Niura? The store-house manageress. She's elderly. Think about it. - No, I'm not going anywhere. - Why are you angry? You'll go. It's here. Do you have bedclothes? Yes, I have. Manufactured. Drink, mum, don't think that I stint on it. - Cheers, Bozek. - To our guest. Stefek, introduce yourself. - Stefek. - Bozek. Mum, show us what you've cooked. - Hey, do you get arithmetics? - More or less. - Do you know Mickiewicz? - Roughly. Go wash your hands. Forgive us if something is wrong, we're ordinary people, not like you, from Warsaw. - Ordinary, but good people. - So cheers. Mum is right - if you want, live here. For free. But don't think that I've an eye for you. I could have had better ones than you. Krem, for example. I don't mean that I don't like you at all, but it's not that. - Do you believe? - I do, but I don't practise. - So cheers. - Cheers. Live here and that's it. - You'll send me a thank-you letter from Warsaw. - I will. - You can meet with your girlfriend, that's not my business. You can meet with your girlfriend, I'm not equal to her. She's a learned person and so on. God bless both of you. - So cheers. - Cheers. Get lost. Although I'm not a gypsy... [it's not in Polish] And I'm a charlatan girl. When mum plays the guitar, there's always something left for the night. And I'm a charlatan girl. It looks like a farewell feast. - How's Niura's place? - It's warm. Magnolias flourish in spring in here, you know? What does she look like? She's a drinker, rather unattractive. - Be reasonable. - Are you afraid? Why should I be afraid? Unless you prefer her. [she sings probably in Russian] - When Bozek comes, send him to me. - Of course. Mr Bozek, the manageress wants to see you. Sit down. Let's have some wine, Bozek. Is it true that you moved in Niura's place? Yes, it's true. But what about your girlfriend? You broke up with her. No. It's... Well, it just happened somehow. - I live at Niura's place. - 'I live'. You don't just 'live' at Niura's place. You left your girlfriend. And for whom? For whom? That's your fault. Why did you think I was a hero? - I'm a rascal like everyone else. - No. You demand too much from me. When it happened, it was all the same. I thought that I lost you, that it was over. I forgive you. You do? You really do? I forgive you everything, but it won't happen again. You see, we're not so miserable together. It would be better if I changed the job. No. I'll come back to my little house. - I want to be with you. - And what will you tell her today? That I feel bad, my heart is hurts me. I'll just go to sleep. I'll be waiting here tomorrow. If it isn't like you said, then don't come here. I'll guess it. I'll come. Come in! - Can I come in? - Yes. I have to move out. I saw her on the street. I knew it's over anyway. Everything's over. I'm sorry, Niura. One shouldn't tell such things to a woman. One should always lie. At least that's what you deserve. Don't move out, Bozek. What will people say? Stay. No-one will disturb you here. Who do you think I am, Bozek? Who do you think I am? Niura! Lucyna! Lucyna... Good morning. They are here. Scram, quickly. They've surrounded me. So little time, so little time... They're calling me. I'll talk to them. I have to finally end this. I want to be with Lucyna. And we want to live like normal people. Now you know everything. Run away. No. I can't run away. Everything will be alright. Goodbye? Goodbye. Bozek. Bozek! Why did you hurt my sister? You shouldn't behave like this! Lucyna is a nice and good person, she's... spotless! If it was for me - you would see! They've called me. I'm not afraid of them. I want them to leave me alone. I'm a good person. I've to tell this to them. I won't be nagged anymore, Lucyna too. I'll ask them, why. What do they want? How long can one live like this? Gentlemen, there's no point. What do you want? They're coming. God, they're coming. What are you doing here so early? I yearn. I yearn like a kite yearns for the rain. Damn it. - I'm here. - Yes? Only you. I want to hear it here. Here. Only you. I can't bear this anymore. Lucyna... I'll go away. You won't have to bear this anymore. Hide. Bozek, I'm scared. What do you both think?! Get out of here! I've nothing in common with this! Get out of here! I've a wife and children! I've a son! They'll kill all of us! Kill all of us! Zygmunt. Bozek, I'm scared. Don't be. Fine. Our people will win. It won't last long. It won't last long... It won't last... You know. THE END
