If he wanted to, he'd be here already. He must have forgotten that its your first wedding anniversary. No, that will never happen. No matter where in the world he is, he will be here today Do you trust him so much? Well, they are the ideal husband and wife. [VEHICLE APPROACHES] I guess he is here. Excuse me. Are you Mrs. Kapoor? Yes. Why? I'm sorry to say that your husband was murdered on a train. No! That's impossible! No! That's impossible! Please come. [SOBBING] My dear. [DRUMS PLAYING] [DRUMS PLAYING] Don't touch! The devil is back. He was in prison. What's he doing here? He must have escaped. Take it. [CHUCKLES] [THUD] Off I go. Good bye. Sit down! [GROANS] Darn you! Amar! [SWITCH CLICK] [FINGER SNAP] Come in. Boss, here is Amar. Hello, Amar. Sit down. - When were you released from prison? - He wasn't released, boss. He escaped from prison. Old habits die hard. - Have a drink? - Sure. [DRINK POURING] Do you have a job for me? I have something big for you. You may know that Mr. Kishan Kapoor was murdered. I read it in today's newspapers. But who killed him? We have nothing to do with the murder. But we are after gold worth 10 million.. ..that he has left behind. Where is the gold? It's your job to find it. What's my share in this deal? The same as before. Who are Kishan Kapoor's family members? His beautiful wife. An old nanny. And some servants. What is his widow like? An ideal Hindu wife. Oh, I see. Does she drink? Nonsense! Ideal wives like her don't drink. - They are quite pious. - Address? 52, Malabar Hill. And here's your advance. [SIREN WAILING] Police. You may leave. - Keep Ranjeet informed. - Right, sir. Move! Move, man! Move! Hello, boss. Have you struck a deal with Amar? Yes. But you have to keep an eye on them. You need to check on Amar because.. ..he is over smart. As far as Ranjeet is considered.. ..he is a bit too emotional. Got it? Okay, boss. - Saw him? - No, sir. Okay. Get in the jeep quickly. Hurry up. Let's go. [CHUCKLES] So long, inspector. Who is it? Thief! Thief! - Tall thief! - Shut up! Gangubai, don't shout. It isn't a thief. It's Amar. - Where had you been all these days? - Well.. ..I had gone to America. - Do you know America? - Yes. I do. It's near Africa. Yes, that's right. But what are you doing here alone? Who's this? This is Gangubai. She's very nice. Honestly, I don't get along with aunt. I came here and hired a maid. You're so small and you do such things. I can't help it. You go to America or Africa so often. If I depend on you, I'll be in trouble. Will you have something to eat? This is no time for breakfast. - I guess you are Mrs. Kapoor. - Yes. I am so unlucky. He helped me become an engineer. I wanted to offer my first salary to him. But he is no more. Mrs. Kapoor, I am Amar. He must have told you about me. My husband was very generous. He would help someone without taking credit. Anyway, how can I help you? Please don't embarrass me, Mrs. Kapoor. I should support you in your hour of grief. May I help you in anyway? [KNOCK ON DOOR] Are you Mrs. Kapoor? Yes. And you? I am CB Saxena. I am an inspector from Enforcement Branch. Our department has got information that.. ..your husband had smuggled gold worth 10 million. - Who are you? - I am a well-wisher of this family. - You can think I'm a family friend. - I see. Do not move until we finish our investigation. Please hand over the keys to me. - Thank you. - Welcome. Come on. Don't worry. Problems always come in dozens. I will share all your joys and sorrows. Thank you. Here are your keys. Excuse me, Inspector. You have done something wrong. He was a decent and respectable man. His wife is mourning over his death. Very bad. Mind you! Your behavior is not only illegal, but inhuman as well. You may take legal action against it. I will definitely do that. [FOOT STEPS] [SCOFFS] Thank you very much. You supported me in this. Shall I tell you something? - Tell me. - Tomorrow morning my sister-in-law.. - ..Monica is returning from London. - Oh, Monica is returning? My husband must have told you.. ..that she is not a good girl. She has all the vices caused by bad environment. My husband hated her. He would get angry reading her letters. Have you ever seen her? No. She had gone to London before I got married. Ms. Monica, wake up. We are in India. - I know we are in India. - Welcome to India, Ms. Monica. Who are you? Your sister-in-law has sent me to pick you up. So my sister-in-law thinks.. ..that I don't know the road to my house. [CHUCKLES] Go ahead. I will come on my one. Ms. Monica, don't create a scene in public. People in the city respect your brother a lot. Let's go home. Come on. - Let go of my hand. - I say come on. No. I want to change. You can do that. But don't humiliate yourself in public. - Okay. - Let me take you to the changing room. Welcome, Monica. So you are my sister-in-law? So glad to meet you. - When do you plan to send me back? - What? Yes. I won't stay here for long. Hand over my property, this house, to me. So that I can sell it and go back to London. - I don't like India at all. - Monica, my husband died a few days back. - But you talk about division. - Division? What division? This is my house. My father had willed it to me. - Shall I show you the papers? - No need. I know everything. I give you two days. Either hand over this house to me.. ..or buy it from me, Only Rs. 500,000. Otherwise I'll have to do this legally. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Don't touch it. It's for me. [TELEPHONE RINGING] - Hello. - Hi, my darling Monica. How are you? Hi, Manoj. How are you, darling? - Why didn't you come to the airport? - How could I, darling? Monica, I received your telegram quite late. - So when do we meet? - Whenever you want. - I came here on your bidding. - Wonderful. I have organized a party for you tonight. Wow! Such a great idea! Listen, will there be only drinks or drinks and dance? - Darling, dance and drinks both. - Both? Oh, boy! That's fine! Fine! You're a wonderful person. - Come soon. - I'll change and come right away. - Bye bye. - Okay. See you. I have to go to a party. You won't go to the party. What nonsense? You can't stop me. Can't go to the party? - What now, Mr. Amar? - I can handle the party. But if she goes to court for the house, you'll be in big trouble. It's okay. I will leave this house if I have to. Can't we buy out the house? But I don't have Rs 500,000. My husband had taken all the cash with him. And until I am declared his heir I can't get money from the banks. What about the gold? What gold? For which the Enforcement Branch raided the house. If there was gold here, my husband would definitely tell me. He loved me a lot. He left everything to me. So was that false information? Absolutely. Pardon me for asking this silly question.

What is it, Shinde? Let me tell you. This goon has been teasing my sister. Lie! White lie! Let it down. The lungi. - I would lose balance if I do that. - Let it down. Shut up! - Is it true, Shinde? - Hello, Shinde. Yes, sir. This man is always drunk. He looks at every woman in the wrong way. - Lodge a case against him. - Okay, sir. Let's go. Okay. Good bye. Inspector.. ..can I ever tease a girl? No. Okay. Can I look at a woman in a wrong way? - Not at all. - So tell me. Who do I look like? You look like a religious monk. - What? - Religious monk. Religious monk? Spot on! Thank you. I am leaving. Where are you going? - Home. - Constable, put him in! What? I was just brought in. You will take me out and then in again. What's going on? Shut up, will you? Take him in! - Let's go! - Wait up. Let me talk to him. Let me go. I want to talk to him. Inspector, I promise.. ..I will never tease a girl. I will consider them as mothers and sisters. - Got that? - Come on! Let go. Scoundrel! Loafer! - Who? - You. Wait up. Stop. Sister, will you be guarding outside my cell? - Shut up! - Okay, put me in there. Not there! Over here! Counselor, this is Mrs. Kapoor, my sister-in-law. Mrs. Kapoor, I have got court orders for you. You have to vacate this house immediately. You will have to hand it over to my client, Ms. Monica. Counselor, give me some time. So that I can find a place to stay. I'm not authorized to do that. My client Ms. Monica can do that. I'm sorry. I can't do anything. I want to sell this house today and go back to London. With my fiancé. - We are getting married next Wednesday. - Monica, don't be so cruel. - He was your brother after all. - Brother? Brother, my foot! A brother maintains good relationships with his sister. - He hated me a lot. - It was your fault too, Monica. I'm not here to be lectured by you. Counselor, do your work. Sir, I beg of you. You don't have to do that. I am capable enough that.. ..that I can arrange for two meals for my benefactor's widow. I don't have a palace, but I have a tenement. Come with me. Let's go. That's all? You won't take anything else? He is everything to me. I have lived under his protection. I will die worshipping him. This is an ideal Indian woman. - And you.. - Oh, shut up! - Let's go, counselor. - Monica. Hazarimal, stop this nonsense. - So what do I do? - Buyout Kishan Kapoor's house. Who is this Kishan Kapoor? The one who was murdered. His sister has come from London. She is selling the house. Got that? Listen carefully. Gold worth 10 million has been hidden in the house. That much gold? Are you crazy? If there is that much gold in the house.. ..why didn't his wife take it with her? You must know, an old husband never shares such things with a young wife. She might take the stuff and run away with her boyfriend. [SHUSHING] Tone it down. My wife is also young and the world is a bad place. Did you call me? There, she heard everything. - Yes, Topanmal is here. Get a cup of tea. - Right away. Only one? Won't you have it? We can share it. Why waste money? We live in bad times. Hazarimal, there is no time. I have Kishan Kapoor's sister in my clutches. If she finds another broker, we'll be in a loss. I can't get Rs. 500,000 today. If I borrow it from the market, people will find it fishy. - Because the world is a bad place. - How much do you have? - Rs. 400,000. - You can have my jewelery. Those must be worth Rs. 100,000. But we will gain 10 million. How do you know that? I belong to a Marwadi family. I heard everything in there. My hands are cooking, but my ears are focused on the conversation here. We live in bad times. Topanmal, don't let this house slip through our hands. No, brother. This is not your house, it's aunt's. - Say sorry. - Sorry. Now come on, aunt. My pocket money? So smart! He fooled both of us. - I don't have to fool you. You already are. - A fool? [BUS APPROACHING] You devil! - Oh, my bus. - Come on. Bus is here. Run along. He's so lovely. Yes, and your presence has made him more carefree. What's wrong? You seem sad. I feel I am a burden on you. - It's my life.. - Don't say such things. It's an honor. And you don't know.. ..that I am indebted to your husband. God has done injustice to you. - When can I get possession? - Now. Give her the money, Hazarimal. Well, now I'll be a millionaire. I get gold worth 10 million. It has it's own charm. - Gold worth 10 million? - He is thinking about the bullion market. He has bought gold worth 10 million today. - Oh. - Here you are. Here, madam. It's Rs. 500,000. I am an honest businessman. - Please count. - You don't have to do that. Thank you, Mr. Hazarimal. Ma'am, now I am Karodimal. Okay. Karodimal. Bye-bye. Let's go, counselor. - Bhai-bhai. - That's not what she said. Idiot, it's bye-bye. Ta-ta. It means, our job is done. We are leaving. It's a bad world. My job is done. I am leaving. Where are you going? What about my brokerage? - Your brokerage? - Yes. - My commission. - I got you. Listen, you can take it on the 7th of the sixth month. What a wonderful date? Okay, give me the taxi fare. Since when do brokers travel in taxis? Taxi fare? Here are 8 annas. Take bus no. 10. You'll reach Ghatkopar. We live in bad times. Don't stay out late at night. Good. The Marwadi is smart. I hope the coin is not counterfeit. I sympathize with you, Mrs. Kapoor. Inspector, I wonder what wrong had my husband done to anyone. Don't worry. Your husband's murderer will be arrested. The department's pride is also at stake here. Thank you very much, Inspector. I will always be grateful to you. I will take your leave. We'll be in London tomorrow morning, darling. And in the marriage registrar's office the day after. It's a greater thrill to be called Mrs. Manoj than Ms. Monica. And it's really thrilling to become a husband. Only I can know that. - Manoj, I love you so much. - Have another drink, darling. This is our last peg in India. We might never return. I have also sold all my property. Very good. How much did you get? - Around Rs. 300,000. - That's very nice. You have 300,00 and I have 500,000. We have a total of Rs. 800,000. Enough to last a lifetime. Right? Yes, darling. That's why I did this for you. Wonderful would be the life spent in your arms. - I was waiting for this day. - I love you. Darling, close your eyes for a few moments. - Why? - Done? I have something important to give you. Done? Open your eyes. [CHUCKLES] Drink it in one sip. Quickly. Well done. Finish it. Very good. Well done. "There is so much fun to have a friend." - "You better ask me. - Your eyes are.." - Who is there? - Wake up. Ma'am, wake up. - Who is it? - It's me. Hotel Manager Rangaswami. - Where is Manoj? - Manoj from the film 'Upkaar'? - Sorry. Your boyfriend has left. - He left? - Where? - London. He said he will go to London on tonight's plane. You will pay the bill. - Me? - Yes. Manoj can't do that. - Where is my bag? - Black one? He took it. Rangaswami, I am ruined. He stole my money. Oh, god! Such a scoundrel! Ma'am, pay the hotel bill. Excuse me. Has the flight to London left? It just took off, ma'am. [WHOOSH] - Do you want to go to London? - No. - Cheers! - Hail the Goddess. It's sad, Amar. A smart guy like you couldn't do the job in all these days. Ranjeet, I think the gold is not in Kishan Kapoor's house. Whether it is or isn't in the house, but the gold does exist. Could be. But Shobha doesn't know about it. - I have tried many ways to get it out of her. - Impossible. Shobha's husband was quite old. Kishan Kapoor loved her a lot. Shobha loved him too. It's impossible that Kishan Kapoor did not tell her about the secret. I don't believe it, Ranjeet. If it were true, Shobha wouldn't leave that bungalow and come to mine. She could have paid off Monica. She wouldn't have lived like a hapless woman. Perhaps, she has fallen in love with you. The void that her old husband's death created in her life.. ..can be filled with a young and handsome guy like you. - She's a young woman after all. - What nonsense? Shobah is a devoted wife. It's not right to think of her like that, Ranjeet. Boss.. - What news do you have? - It's not so simple, boss. Amar thinks Shobha doesn't know about the gold. - What does Ranjeet think? - He thinks the gold is in the house. They are both idiots. The gold is not in that house. But Shobha knows where it is. How can you say that? I have spent my whole life in such things, Rita. I don't want to reveal myself this early. Amar is a criminal. A criminal doesn't deceive another. But Ranjeet.. ..is neither a criminal nor decent. Such men are dangerous and idiots. You focus more on Ranjeet than Amar. - Got it. - Yes, boss. Get as close to Ranjeet as possible. If you have to pretend to be in love with him, then do it. - Okay, boss. - Good girl Did you find out anything, Inspector? I'm sorry, Ms. Monica. I inquired with Air India. Manoj didn't reach London. He got down in some other city. Besides, his London address you gave us.. ..is false. Nobody named Manoj lives there. But inspector, I would visit that house. I have met his parents. Ms. Monica, a person who can commit such a large fraud.. ..he can do anything. Fake house, fake friends.. ..and fake parents too. Anyway, you may go home now. I'll inform you as soon as we get a lead. Inspector, please do something. I am ruined. I am broke. I am doomed. I don't know what to do. I will go mad. I'll go mad. - Come on. - Hey.. - Ma'am, bill. - What? How much? Rs.19.45. Oh, very cheap. Sorry. I don't have the money. - I'll pay tomorrow. - That's okay. [CHUCKLES] If you want, I can pay your bill. Thank you. I'll repay you tomorrow. I don't want the money back. If we can see each other, I'll be okay. What do you mean? I mean, let's go out for an hour or two. They provide rooms here as well. - Oh, really? - Yes. You! - Stop! - Get lost! You come to drink in this place.. - ..and consider virtuous. - You rascal! Darn you! Stop it! Stop it, man! [SCREAMING] Police! Police! This girl is a dynamite! Let me go! Let go! - Let her go. - Tall guy, who are you? Your boss. I'll teach you a less. - Let her go. - She didn't pay the bill. - I'll pay it. She broke the furniture and bottles. This is old furniture. Don't touch her. Is she your sister? Aren't you ashamed of yourself? This place is not for good girls like you. - I don't need your favor. - Shut up! - Boss, my bill? - Take this, you idiot. No money and no girl either. Oh. Hey! How did I end up in this room? How? I brought you. - Who changed my clothes? - I did. You? Oh, no! But I didn't see anything. I looked the other way while changing your clothes. - And while putting them on? - I still looked the other way. I am a good man. You can trust me. Those clothes smelled of liquor. Why are you doing this? Because you are a good girl. And I like good girls. - You are an idiot and stupid. - Thank you, ma'am. You have a name for me. You bearded guy, you are very stubborn - Really? - Sir, your parcel. - What's in it? - Sari for you. Sari? Oh, no! I hate saris. - I hate every Indian dress. - What do you like? Do you love the betrayer who stole your money? - How do you know? - I found out. But remember, you can't leave India. You will live here like a good Indian girl. Got that? But I'm not a good girl. I have gone astray. I drink and I dance. I have many bad habits. Everything can change, but you should have the will to change. It's not about how bad you are. But about how long you choose to be bad. It's never too late. I am leaving. If you need anything, call the waiter. Okay? 'Everything can change, but you should have the will to change.' 'It's not about how bad you are.' 'But about how long you choose to be bad.' 'It's never too late.' No! I won't do breakfast until my brother comes. Dear, he will come soon. Maybe he had some work, so he stayed there. Why? He should know that I was waiting for him since night. Sorry, buddy! Sorry! That won't do. You have to have breakfast with us. Okay, sir. I agree. - Gangubai! - Yes, sir. Serve breakfast. - Breakfast? I.. - What's wrong? Sir, I can't touch anything for three days. But why? You have to be a woman to understand. I got it. - What is it? Tell me. - You won't understand. - You too have it. - No, I'm holding a fast today. Fast? What for? Every widow holds this fast for her husband's soul. It's been two months since he expired. I'm sorry for hurting your feelings. Dear, don't look at me. Dig faster. If we don't find the gold, we'll be ruined. The world is a bad place. [SPITING] How much do I dig? We have destroyed the entire house. Dear, the gold is worth 10 million. Kishan Kapoor must have hidden it somewhere. Let's dig somewhere else. We'll surely find the gold. To hell with your gold! I don't want it. Topanmal has cheated us. - Did you think of me? - Here he comes. Deal with him. You called and here I am. - Sir, it's the 7th day of the sixth month. - Okay. I have got sweets. I hope you have found the gold. Yes, wherever we dig, we get gold. - My brokerage. - Brokerage. - My commission. - Yes, you will get it. Take your share of gold and I'll give you handsome commission. - Give me the sweet box. - Here you are. Come here. Don't look at me. Send him over. [INDISTINCT] You have ruined my Rs. 500,000. Take this. - Listen to me. - It's too late for that. - You got my jewelry sold. - Listen to me. We've heard enough. - You listen to us. - Darn you! [INDISTINCT] Hold him tight. Don't hit me. - We will not spare you. - [GROANS] [GASPS] He is gone. He is gone. He is running away! Catch him! He is getting away. "Take away my heart, darling." "Take away my heart, darling." "This love is true. Take away my love." "This love is true. Take away my love." "Take my heart away, beloved." "Take my heart away, beloved." "This love is true. Take away my love." "This love is true. Take away my love." "Take my heart away, darling." "I'm not like the sky that changes color constantly." "My love is not so weak." "I have met thousands here." "None keep their word." "I'm not one of them. Trust my loyalty." "This love is true. Take away my love." "This love is true. Take away my love." "Take my heart away, darling." "Branches bow down for me." "The sun and the moon protect me." "This greenery is at your feet." "There's no magician like you." "Thinking of you makes my heart lighter." "This love is true. Take away my love." "This love is true. Take away my love." "Take my heart away, beloved." "If I am the wind, you are the garden of love." "This love is true. Take away my love." "This love is true. Take away my love." "Take my heart away, darling." "Take my heart away, beloved." "This love is true. Take away my love." "This love is true. Take away my love." "Take away my heart, darling." "Take my heart away, beloved." "This love is true. Take away my love." "This love is true. Take away my love." - Sir. - Okay. - Gangaram. - Hello, sir. Hello, Gangaram. Listen, we are letting you go. On one condition. You won't consume alcohol. You will respect every woman. Got that? I have begun to respect women the day you locked me in. I promise I won't consume alcohol. I won't misbehave with a girl. If by mistake I come face to face with a girl.. ..I will close my eyes. Very good. You can go. - Sir, may I leave? - Yes. Sure? - Sir. - What now? May I ask something? Go ahead. I have to go home. I have to shave. I don't have money. If you can give me Rs. 2, I would be grateful. For your drink? If you don't trust me, lock me again. Come on. - Wait there. I trust you. - Don't you? I give you Rs. 5 instead. But remember what you said to me. Okay? - You may go. - I know you would give me Rs. 10. I take your leave. Good bye. - Don't forget! - No. - Hello. - What? Mummy. [HUMMING] - What's wrong? - Monica. I've run out of cigarettes. Can I get them from that shop? Wait here. I'll get them. From that shop, right? Please, Monica. You don't have to take the trouble. Let me serve you some times. Okay. You may go. [SIGHS] Why have stopped the motorcycle in the middle of the road? Are you traffic inspector or police inspector? Oh, shut up! Remove you shades. I won't. Remove your shades. You bluffer! Shut up. [GROANING] So long, old boy. - Who beat him up? - I did. - Why? - He is so insolent. He asked what I am doing with such a beautiful girlfriend. I got angry and beat him. - What's this hair here? - Hair? It must be the inspector's. Listen. Another police jeep is coming this way. We should leave before things get serious. Hop on. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [HISSING] Hey ma'am. What's your name? Gangubai. And yours? I am Gangaram Sakharam Patil. - Where are you from? - Kolhapur. - Kolhapur? That's my native place too. - So what? I like guys from Kolhapur. Ma'am, you are amazing. I liked it. Let's go for a stroll. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Patil, where are you taking me? Where? On the beach. Come on. I'll buy you Bhel puri spiced with red chilly powder. - Bhel puri spiced with red chilly powder? - Like it? - Yes. - This will be fun. Come with me. What if my boss returns? To hell with your boss? Come with me. Come on. - Gangubai! - Oh, no! He is here. Who? My boss! Go hide! Where? - Not there. This way. - Where do I hide? - Let me go. - Patil, hide here. - Where? Let me hide here. - Hide there. - Not there. Hurry up. - Then where? Where do I hide? Come this way! - Let me go. What are you doing? - Sleep here. Gangu. - What are you doing? - Go to sleep. - Gangubai, wrap me with it. I will fall. - Quiet! - Be quiet! - Let me go, Gangubai. Do not speak. - Take your feet in. Come on. - Shall I cut them off? Quiet. Quiet. What's wrong, Gangubai? You look scared. No. Cheeku, you are home early? What is this mattress doing here? Gangubai, keep it in the other room. I'll do that. Let me first serve food to Cheeku. Food later. First take the bed away. So Cheeku. Is it heavy? Shall I help you, Gangubai? No. I'll manage, sir. What was I thinking? - Who was that, Gangubai? - I didn't call him. He came along. He winked at me and I wrapped him in a blanket. - But don't let such people in the house. - Okay. - Where is Shobha? - She has gone to the temple. She said she'll be late. After the prayers, she will take a bath in some religious place. It is the new moon night. A dip in the holy river is important for widows on this night. Don't pull the sari. I know you are here. Oh, Ranjeet. You made me wait quite long. Do you remember when we last met? It's been several days. But I was married then. Now I'm a widow. You were like a widow even when he was alive and so are you now. I had loved you back then and intend to do so now. It was different back then. I would live in a huge house. I could do everything under the pretext of society, club or party. But now.. ..I live in someone else's house. I am being watched all the time. Forget these things. Nobody can stop if we want to meet. No, Ranjeet. Let me go. - Shobha! - Someone might see us. Let go, Ranjeet. Please. - There is nobody here. - Let me go. Ranjeet, no. You got scared? That's why I suggest we should end it all. Get that gold out and start a new life. I am willing to marry you. But I don't have the gold. - Where is it? - I don't know, Ranjeet. I don't.. Someone is coming. I'll see you here at this hour tomorrow. - Gangubai! - Yes, sir. - Cheeku is asleep. Take him to the bed room. - Okay. And you may have your food. - Shall I go to sleep as well? - No, play tennis. Idiot! I'm sorry, Mr. Amar. I got delayed at the temple. Have this oblation. What's that mark on your neck? Neck? Must be a scratch. The path from the temple is teeming with thickets. Have it. Amar, what does your philosophy say? Does the woman know about the smuggled gold? No. Amar, you might remember.. ..that I had said that you are still inexperienced when it comes to women. - Really? - Let me repeat it today. You are too inexperienced. Anyway, forget it. It's not your cup of tea to understand a woman. Single or double? Empty to bottle. Why are you standing there? Come here. Are you angry? Is it because I didn't tell you about the gold? Ranjeet, believe me. I don't know where the gold is. So why was Mr. Kapoor killed? I ask you that. Because you got him killed.. ..thinking you will get the gold. Not me alone. The both of us. Because you were part of the plan. I never wanted him dead. My husband was never a barrier for me. He never tried to find out about my private life. But why are you talking about this? Can't we spend these few moments talking about something nice? Let's sit over there. What's wrong, Ranjeet? I don't sense any love. [GASPS] - You? - Yes, me! Now I know that even a witch can pretend to be a deity. You are so shameless! Are you as pious as Sita and Savitri? Die in hell! - Amar! - Shut up! I'll hand you over to the police for killing Mr. Kapoor. Before you do that, I'll kill you. Shobha.. Shobha.. [GASPS] - What do you say now? - No, Shobha. Shobha. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOTS] Something untoward has happened, Ranjeet. I've killed Amar. He found out the truth about me. Ranjeet, what do I now? Ranjeet, please! - You? - Yes, it is I. But you were killed. I.. Yes, I was killed! But unfortunately, I did not die. How is that possible? I had fired three bullets with my revolver. It was your revolver. - But I had loaded the bullets. - Point! Those were blanks. - Ranjeet, what is going on? - It is crystal clear. - Amar works for me. - Right. I had sent him there to find out the truth about you. - Ranjeet! - The two of us are partners in this deal. - What deal? - About the gold worth 10 million. - Tell me! Where is the gold? - I don't know. You don't know? It's the truth, Ranjeet. I know nothing. For God's sake, let me go. I swear I don't know.. Stop it, Ranjeet! Stop it, will you? - Don't hit her! - You better not interfere, Amar. This is between Shobha and me. This is between the three of us, Ranjeet. Oppression won't bring results. I think Shobha doesn't know about it. Her husband took the secret with him. Forget it. - No way! - I say let her be! Don't mess with me, Amar! I know how to deal with people like you. Rascal! Now I know that Shobha is innocent. She did everything because you threatened her. No woman is born vile. Got that? Mr. Amar, forgive me. You are a good human being. Don't say that. Mr. Amar, I am indebted to you. Do me another favor. Kill me. So that I am rid of this worthless life. I have lost respect. [CRYING] Lost respect. No matter what the world thinks of you, my opinion about you won't change. I can challenge anyone to save you. Come on, wipe your tears. Let's go. I guess you had got into a terrible fight. Wipe the blood now. Well, it was a good plan. But I'm afraid that Amar.. ..would get deceived by Shobha. Just as you were deceived. And you could do nothing about it. Amar might speak like you one day. - But boss.. - Ranjeet.. ..I understand these things much better than you. It's easy to understand the intentions of a smart woman. But.. ..a simple woman like Shobha.. ..who has a deceptive face is difficult to understand. You may leave. [CHUCKLES] It's been so many days. You never wished to meet your sister-in-law. I'll go to her to take blessings after the wedding. Great! You'll marry me! Tall guy with a beard? With a stupid guy? I took pity on you. You might commit suicide otherwise. What about the guy in London who stole your money? Don't even talk about that scoundrel. I've heard first love is difficult to forget. Very difficult, ma'am. Stop this nonsense, will you? Shall I? Let me teach you a lesson. What are you thinking about? That we are leading a worthless life. I can't meet anyone other than goons, criminals, and smugglers. We will go away from this life some day. That is a distant dream. Let us get out of here today. To a place where I can openly express my feelings. Come on, get up. Hurry up. - But where? - Let's just go. "Douse fire with fire." "Let your heart bloom." "Darling, come and hug me." "Come to me." "Douse fire with fire." "Let your heart bloom." "Darling, come and hug me." "Come to me." "Don't you know how to love beautiful girls?" "Can't you have a light talk with them?" "Take me in your arms. Caress my lips. Come on." "Douse fire with fire." "Let your heart bloom." "Darling, come and hug me." "Come to me." "It is not good to shy away." "It is not good to hurt someone." "Make me yours. Lose your heart to me." "Let two hearts meet." "Douse fire with fire." "Let your heart bloom." "Darling, come and hug me." "Come to me." "I am yours. Take my heart away." "Let your heart beat faster." "I am crazy about you. I have fallen for you, darling." "Douse fire with fire." "Let your heart bloom." "Darling, come and hug me." "Come to me." "Douse fire with fire." [HUMMING] - Tell me something. - What? Is there a motive behind your love? What? So you don't understand me yet. I love you, Ranjeet. I can cheat someone else for you. But I won't cheat you for someone else. - Can I trust you? - You better do. Else I will win your trust some day. People are watching. - Shall I add onion? - No! No! The book says.. ..put the onion in the clarified butter. To hell with the author! He doesn't know how to cook. - And you know it well. - Thank you. You should know that I am the head butler of the hotel. My ancestors were born here and died right here. And you will die at my hands. - Add onion to the clarified butter. - No, clarified butter to onion. - I say onion to the clarified butter. - Clarified butter to onion. - Onion to the clarified butter! - Clarified butter to onion! I will add onion to the clarified butter. You are out of your mind. - You are crazy! - You are! - You are crazy! - You are! I say.. - Help, brother. - Stop it, Monica. - You're at it again. - Help! She is angry! - Shall I leave? - Leave, get lost! Shall I bring hot or cold drink? Stop it, Monica. So much anger is not good for health. Stupid! Idiot! He wants to teach me to cook. That's wonderful aroma! Are you making 'halwa'? That's for later. Come with me. I want to show you something. Why not? A packet? Wonderful. Wow! - How is it? - Fantastic! Let us get married right away. Not now. I have fixed an appointment with the marriage registrar at 4 pm tomorrow. So tomorrow we will be husband and wife? Listen. It's 20 hours left for that. What do we do till then? - What? - Shall I tell you? Gangubai, give me the brush. Yes, ma'am. Here you are. Come in and give it. I can't reach it. - I feel shy. - You too are a woman. So why feel shy? - Come in. - Oh, my! What do I do? Here. Scrub my back. Scrub your back? Yes, quickly. Why are you staring? Haven't you seen some other woman like this? I have. But not so beautiful. Your body is like marble statue. Your skin is so fair. Wow, you are creating poetry. Scrub my back. Not here. The back. - Not with this. Use your hands. - My hands? XX XX XX XX Why did you stop there? Please come in. How are you? Ranjeet beat me up badly. I still have wound marks. You may see them. Ranjeet is a demon. Anyway, forget what happened. What things should I forget and remember? My life has become a burden. - Mr. Amar, is it possible? - What? Can you marry me? This is your copy. This is yours. You are now husband and wife. - Wish you a happy marriage. - Thank you, sir. - Come on, darling. - That's all. Ms. Monica. Ms. Monica! What's wrong? Your fiancé isn't here yet. - Well, I think he.. - It's okay. Come tomorrow at the same time. Okay. I know the part of my life you have seen.. ..will make you angry. But that was a compulsion. My father had no choice. He got me married to a rich, but old man. I lost my youth. I never enjoyed marriage. I sympathize with you. That is not enough, Mr. Amar. I need love. Love. Love that I have been yearning for all my life. Mr. Amar, I will give you that gold worth 10 million. The gold which neither the police could get to.. ..nor anyone else. - So it is true? - Yes. Either I or my husband knew about it. I promise you.. ..I will give you the gold on the next day of marriage. But why this condition of marriage? I will be assured. I feel a person like you won't deceive me. Okay. I am willing to marry you. - Mr. Amar. - Don't call me that. Just call me Amar. - Your Amar. - Amar. [CRYING] "Nobody is yours here." "Nobody is yours here." "O heart, beware there is darkness everywhere." "Nobody is yours here." "O heart, beware there is darkness everywhere." "In this world, every man.." "is a gold digger." "Nobody is yours here." "The palace of love crumbles.." "in a moment." "The companion I lost was never mine." "I was compelled to take to drinks." "Every man in the world.." "is a gold digger." "Nobody is yours here." "O heart, beware there is darkness everywhere." "Nobody is yours here." "Why should I trust anyone? This world is full of stonehearted people." "The world is not ours. It is a like a dagger." "I am better off intoxicated." "In this world, every man.." "is a gold digger." "Nobody is yours here." "O heart, beware there is darkness everywhere." "Nobody is yours here." "I am done with it. Why should I live in this world?" "Tears are in my fate." "Life is like a sore wound." "In this world, every man.." "is a gold digger." "Nobody is yours here." "O heart, beware there is darkness everywhere." "In this world, every man.." "is a gold digger." "Nobody is yours here." Don't touch me! - Monica, listen to me please. - I said don't touch me. How dare you ask what's wrong with me? Cheat! Liar! Betrayer! You sold your love. Go to the place where you have sold your soul. There's no place for you in my life. Monica, what nonsense is this? I have seen your true self. You don't want love, you want property and gold. Cover your soul with that gold. Cover your ears with it. - So that you won't hear people cry. - Monica! Have pity on me. Go away from here. Leave me alone. Go away, Amar. - Okay. - [CRYING] You can't escape today. Let me go! - No! - Someone will see. - Won't let you go. - Let me go. - Let me go. - No. Let go! - You can't leave. - I won't spear you! - Let me go. - I will quench my thirst. - Let me go! Someone will come. - I won't let you go. - I won't let go. - Let me go! - Get lost, Romeo! - He's a man! - He's a man! - I will teach you a lesson. Get up! Up! - Save me! Forgive me. - Darn you! [PANTING] - I will forgive you. - What's this nonsense, Gangubai? Sir, I am Gangaram. Forgive me, sir. I did this to survive. Amazing, Gangaram. You tricked me too. Cheeku, you needed a maid and I needed a job. So I became a woman. Okay? Ms. Shobha, I served you as a woman till now. Now as a man, I will still serve you. - Okay. Get back to work. - Okay. I will do that. [LAUGHS] Swami Gangaram. Who is it? Sir, he is a policeman. - Who is it? - Inspector Shinde. Mr. Shinde, hello. - Have you renounced the world? - The world can't renounce me. I renounced the world. When I chased a woman, you put me in the lock up. When I chased a crossdresser.. ..she broke my heart. This is my only hope. Give it to me. Sir, you too have a smoke. You never know, you too might have to come here. Nonsense! You fraud! He was speaking in English. Give that to me. [INDISTINCT] - Cheers. - All the best. [SIGHS] Are you sure Shobha will reveal the secret to Amar after the wedding? Yes, boss. Ranjeet, you are a fool. That woman fooled you till now. Can't she deceive Amar? Amar and I quite different, boss. He has been successful in every job he accepted. Besides, we are giving him a big share. I hope he doesn't take all the stuff for himself. And we would be left with nothing. If that happens, I won't spare you. Because I did this on your bidding. - When is the wedding? - Tonight. Will you attend? Shobha wants nobody else but a pundit at the wedding. I think that is a ploy. If it is, she won't succeed. Because our men will be surrounding the wedding dais. Okay. Good luck. [WEDDING CHANTS] I will read the mantras. You may take the wedding rounds. Stop this wedding! But why? Because it is a deal.. ..between a rogue and this woman. Mister, how are you doing? What nonsense in this, Monica? Inspector, here is your culprit. He has been deceiving the police and people. I made a mistake that despite knowing the truth.. ..about his record I didn't inform you. What record, Inspector? A hardcore criminal's record which is with the central jail. You had escaped from the jail some time back. Do you remember the jailor? Him? No. I've never been to jail. Right. Such innocent criminals never go to jail. I bet you don't know me either. You run from me all the time. Your picture is there in my police station. The police files have your name as Ranbir.. ..Dilawar Singh and sometimes Button Singh. Inspector, you are mistaken. I'm not that person. Yes, Inspector. He's not the man.. ..who had fake beard, moustache, and wig to deceive all of us. He pretended to be in love with me. He is a god from heaven. He wants to get married to that woman. - Right? - What nonsense? Amar, your game is up. You better surrender to the police. Inspector, my brother can't do this. - Let him go. - Yes, Inspector. I know him better. - He is innocent. - Stop it! Come on. Come on. Inspector, let my brother go. Inspector! Inspector, let my brother go. Cruel woman. What have you done? You couldn't see me happy. Why did you do it, Monica? Well, there is more I can do. Dear, these are the consequences of.. ..taking something that belongs to someone else. Brother! Brother! - Brother! - Cheeku, stop! Brother! Brother, don't go. Brother, don't go! - Brother, stop! - Quiet, Cheeku. - Your brother will be back. - Stop, brother. - Stop, brother. - Be quiet. Brother! Brother! - Let's go home. - Brother! [GASPS] Take her there. And here over there. Come on, quick! [SCREAMING] Let her go! [GASPS] Where are you going? Get inside! Get inside! Hit him! Take the knife away! - I have done nothing wrong. - Oh, really! You sent a good man to jail. What have you done? He cheated me. He's a fraud. - He's a fraud? - Yes. Do you know whose room this is? It's his. Look over there. Whose picture is this beside Goddess Laxmi's? It's yours. He would give you the same respect. He lived for you. He slept with you in his dreams. You call him a cheat? Ma'am, you don't know him well. - But he wanted to marry my sister-in-law. - You're right. - He was compelled to do that. - What kind of compulsion? I don't know. But I am sure.. ..he loves you a lot. Amar is not a fraud. If it is true, I will risk my life to get him released. - That's more like it. Promise? - Promise. It's your last chance. Tell me. Else, you will end up like your husband. I said I know nothing. - Nothing? - No. No. You still don't know? Why do you hit me? Who are you? Why are you after the gold? Why? [CHUCKLES] Do you want to know? Your husband and I.. ..were partners in every crime. We smuggled goods worth millions. But Kishan Kapoor got greedy on the last assignment. That night when we were bringing the gold on the boat.. ..Kishan Kapoor tried to get me killed. His goons threw me in the sea. But I survived. It means.. ..you got my husband killed. No matter who got him killed.. ..I didn't get anything. Amar and Ranjeet worked for me. Amar thought you were pious. And Ranjeet couldn't recognize you despite being your boyfriend. But I knew you were very smart the moment I saw you. But not as smart as me. I will get that gold from you today. Got that? - Tell me. - I said I know nothing about the gold. - I know nothing. - Nothing? - No. - Don't feign innocence. You know nothing? Tell me about the secret you wanted to tell Amar after the wedding. I lied to him as well. [CHUCKLES] But you won't lie to me, honey. Tell me. I ask you one more time. Where is the gold? No. Let me go. Please let me go. Before I assault you further.. - ..tell me where it is. - Come here. This is our chance. If we don't kill him, he will kill us. Because he won't need us tomorrow. Here. - What is that, Ranjeet? - Put this poison pill in his drink. Amar has been jailed. If we eliminate him. The gold will be ours. We can start a new and wonderful life. Be strong. Go on. Right. You are my friend's wife. I ask you politely. Tell me where the gold is. Remember, you won't live unless you tell me. How do I convince you? I don't know. Believe me. [CHUCKLES] Believe you. You? I can't risk believing anyone. [SCOFFS] Everyone is a cheat here. [GUNSHOT] Now you know what happens if you act smart with me. Many have died for the gold. I think I will have to kill you too. Tell me. What do you want me to do? I will tell you, but on one condition. Good. Tell me. You will take half of that gold. I am the owner of the other half because I am your partner's wife. I agree. Ranjeet, stop! Else I will shoot! [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] Get up! [GASPS] - What is it? - Snake. Now tell me. Where is the gold? - Where is the key? - I don't have it. You brought me here and you don't have the key. Shobha, don't act too smart. Else you will disappear without a trace. Got it? [GUNSHOTS] Gold? - I hope you remember your promise. - Yes, I do. We share it equally. Separate my share. - Here? - Yes. [GROANS] [CHUCKLES] Boss! Do you want to take everything? We were partners in this. You? How did you get here? You know I can easily escape from the police. Give me my share. Not just your share. - I think you should take all of it. - Thank you. Get out of my way! - Ma'am, my share? - Who are you? Your husband's manager. I followed you everywhere. Thinking if you find the gold, I would also get some. No. Not at all. Monica, don't worry about me. Catch the boss! [SCREAMING] Cheeku! Brother, help! Aunt, help! Help! Help! Aunt! Save me! Brother! Help! Help! Help! Help! Aunt! Don't worry about me. Catch him! Don't let him escape! [LAUGHING] Idiots! The gold you're fighting over.. ..is still with me. Kishan Kapoor? My dear partner, I am still alive. The one you got killed in the train.. ..was my twin brother. He had come to India from Africa that night. - Dear, you? - Dear? Cheat! Insolent! Don't even think.. ..that I will die before punishing you for your crimes. All this was my plan. I knew everything you did. I replaced real gold with cement pieces. So that you would come here searching for it. And I would shoot you all. You were my best friend. You were my wife. You were a goon who had escaped from prison. Shamsher Singh, shoot them. - No! - Get away, Monica! I hate your face. But I don't want to kill my sister. - I will die with Amar. - No, Monica. Don't give up your life. Move back! Get away, Monica. - Stop! Kill me if you have to. - Shamsher Singh, shoot. Monica and Amar have done you no harm. [GUNSHOT] - Rascal! Scoundrel! - Monica.. [GUNSHOT] Monica, forgive me. - Shobha! Shobha! - Hands up! Drop your guns, else I'll shoot him. Drop them! You deceived everyone. - Stop it! - Inspector, this is my boss. - Rascal, you? - Yes, boss. If you are smart, I am smarter. [GUNSHOT] Your game is up, Kishan Kapoor. You would better surrender to the police. And the smuggled gold as well. It made you a criminal. Your wife went astray for it. And your brother lost his life for it. Your partner was out to kill you. - And you.. - Sir, I have done my duty. A traitor is before you. The other has been apprehended by the police. Well done, Amar. Your plan has been successful to the dot. CID department is proud of you. - CID Inspector? - Ms. Monica.. ..I hope you won't consider Amar a cheat. No, sir. Never. But you always considered me a fraud. You? Cheat! Fraud! You stole my money. Sir, arrest him right now. Ms. Monica, you never recognized Mr. Manoj. He came into your life.. ..to get you on the right path. If he had not stolen the money.. ..you wouldn't be what you are today. Mr. Manoj had deposited the money at the CID office. Manoj, I am sorry. I misunderstood you. - You're really great. - Thank you. Sir, here's the second culprit. First, they were business partners. Now they will be partners in jail. Inspector, arrest this man. Hi, darling. After all, I win the game. "Take my heart away, darling." "Take my heart away, beloved." "This love is true. Take away my love." "This love is true. Take away my love."
