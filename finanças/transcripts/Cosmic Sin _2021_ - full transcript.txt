Take it off. I've always wanted to fuck in this thing. Wait. Do you listen? We're literally the only people on this fucking rock. Baby. Baby, the world is ours. "Enchant√©"? What is that, French? What the fuck? Another ship in orbit. Something is here. There's nothing there. Look. Hello? Hello? Hello? Show you more. See, babe? We're 100% absolutely alone. Stay there. Felix. Felix? Felix? Niro, you up there? Loud and clear. What? Put me through to the Alliance Command this is an emergency. This is Captain Juda Sayle of the Vander Corp mining vessel 4217. I need to report an FC incident. Repeat, I need to report an FC incident. This is Alliance Command. Did you say an FC incident? Correct. I think it's the first contact. Captain, it is crucial you answer the following was the contact positive or negative for both species? Um... our security officer uh, uh, uh, he's shot. Uh, uh, uh... Was first contact positive or negative? Positive or negative? Six years running you can't ever be on time for Thanksgiving. I can't solve everybody's goddamn problems. Why do you even bother saying you're coming home? I got another call coming through. Go for Ryle. Sir, there's been an incident on a Vander... Handle it. It's my one fuckin' night off all year. What is it? A credible FC encounter was just reported. Come again? Survivors of the encounter are en route to McMillian Airfield. What are your orders, sir? I want you to tell Commander Tieve to contact Dr Lea Goss. Do you understand me? Listen to me. Get me James Ford. - Sir? - You heard me. Get him to the base, tell no one. I'm 40 minutes out. Do it. Copy that. Thanks for meeting me. I got a job for you. Cash. Quick job. But it's on... Good evening, General. Oh, wait. You're just a civilian now, like the rest of us, ain't you? See, the boys and I prefer not to share your company. So if you could kindly take your murderous ass someplace else we'd really appreciate it. Once upon a time, you were a big bad motherfucker but now... But now? Uh, come on, fellas. Fellas, fellas. Get out, boys, while you're still alive. Mr James Ford. Ruining another Friday night for all. What? When I hear music, I dance and tonight, the universe is singing a tune that will change everything. God, you still talk so much. Oh, well, you're listening. How you doing, Dash? Oh, I'm good. Hmm. Are you still living in the shadows of your old commander? Hey, man, half the world wants to fight him the other half wants to buy him a drink so either way, I come out on top. I'll take that as a "yes". Uh, Mr Ford, General Ryle is requesting your inimitable counsel for a situation that may change the cosmos as we humble cavemen know them. No. No? Well, let nobody accuse you of being a poet. He needs you. The whole world needs you. Well... the world needs something. They made it clear that it's not me. Si vis pacem, para bellum. The last time I heard that saying you used it as an excuse to justify dropping a Q-bomb on 70 million souls. I was following orders from the Alliance. Orders you issued to yourself, hmm? But guess what Ryle told the Alliance Senate? You want peace you get ready for war. He's offered to reinstate you. Hey, we're sort of a package deal now so, here you go. Thank you. Pay my tab. Drinks are on Marcus, thank you. Have a good night. Make sure he knows we're serious. Charming. Situation status, Defcon 4. All hands to the stations... Um, uh, I mean, he shot our security officer. H-he shot... um, uh. Are you kidding me? Oh, shit. What is he doing here? Relax, you two. Play nice. Ryle simply wants you to advise. I can't give advice if I don't know the situation. Where is Ryle? Incoming, to protect us. Protect us from what? Possible first contact. It wasn't SETI, it wasn't NASA just a couple of roughnecks bumping uglies in the boonies. Is this real? I think so. It feels real. Well, I mean, this changes everything. They say that about a lot of things but I still pay my taxes and the sun still rises so let's see. Hey, you guys, uh, you seem kinda chill about this. Do you not understand the implications of this first contact? We may not be alone in the universe. Do you think aliens have music? Do you think they dance? Do you think they pay your bar tab? The Vandermeer is dropping out of quant space. Landing in Bay 3. Right now, you're on the proverbial bench. Ryle might call you up for a Hail Mary. So, you know the drill. Hurry up and wait. One thing. If I were you prepare a Q-bomb. Immediately. Go for Sergeant Locke. Give me a quant tech. Now. Hi, baby! I missed you. Did you miss me? Yeah, you did. Mwah! - Hey, wrench! - Who's a good boy? - Hold up! - Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no. Leave's been cancelled. Come on, Sarge, don't do this to me! You're in the parking lot, you're on base means you're still on duty. We got some secret squirrel shit goin' on and they need a wrench who can work the quant port. Hey. I'm callin' you wrench cos you're an engineer. Well, I have plans with friends. Your only friend is the Alliance. Well, now, you see if I actually got the leave I was promised I could, you know, have a life. I mean, what do they need a quant tech for at 1:00am anyway? How the hell do I know? It's above our pay-grade but I did see old man Ford on deck, so... What do you want me to do? You want me to tell 'em I couldn't get to you before you left? Wow. What happened to your friends? With all due respect, Sarge, fuck you. Quant port failure. Error code GR-76. Yeah, you couldn't be easy, could you, Johnny? Who the hell is Johnny? Oh, it's Johnny Q, the quant port. Yeah, I get it. How much time do you need? Uh... ten? You got five. Well, I'm gonna need ten. Fine, Ryle just sent you the authorisation codes. Alrighty. Q-bomb generation authorised. Uh, sir... what do they need a Q-bomb for? To jump-start a car. How the hell should I know? Should be on a beach drinkin' a mai tai. This is just a drill, right? More than likely. OK, she should be ready in 15 minutes. What happened to ten? Is what it is, Sarge. The Vandermeer is landing in Bay 6. Let's go. No smoking behind the wire, specialist. Yes, sir. I don't give a damn if your uncle is our boss or not. Just enjoyin' the view, sir. The hell's happenin', by the way? I couldn't tell you even if I knew. So they cancelled our leave this weekend just so we could play rent-a-cop? It's locals weekend at the titty bar, sir you could've came with. I've told you this a thousand times. Sacrifice is the currency of soldiering. Quit bein' a smart ass. Yes, sir. Just doin' the job. Fine. You know what the hell's goin' on? We're about to find out. Where are they going? Contamination protocol. Fuck that, we don't have time. I need to interview the survivors immediately. Every second that passes... Statute four, paragraph three states "Decontamination protocol must be..." Protocol? It is protocol to contact the senate at first contact. I'm guessing Ryle wants to know what we're facing before he starts to panic. And I need to determine whether first contact was a net positive or negative for either species while the events are still fresh in their minds. Let me do my job. Ryle's three minutes out. Why aren't you back at your post? What's goin' on here? Eyes open, mouth shut. Are you OK? Hey. Fuck. Hands in the air. - Hands in the air! - Don't shoot! Cease advancing or I will shoot. Fuck this. That's a fucking soldier. Back, Doc! Out! Out! Aim for the eyes! Aim for the eyes! Back, back, back! What do you think you're doing? The bitch spit acid and melted a face! What the fuck was that? Hostiles are on the base. I repeat, hostiles are on the base. Let me out! I'm so sorry. - Let me the fuck out! - I'm so sorry! Braxton, hold your position. Doc, get out of there, get out of the way! Amazing. Amazing? What, do you wanna fuck it or kill it? - Doc, move! - Do not engage! I'm makin' an executive decision. We go now! Go, go, go! Where's the arsenal? About three hangars down that way, sir. Ford, what the fuck are you doing? Don't be a hero. Move, move! Watch out for the blood! Stay away from the blood! Sir? No! It's a fucking bloodbath! Alright, that's it, I'm calling it. Oh, he's here. He's here! Lockdown in effect. - General Ryle, sir. - The fuck is happening? The aliens are camouflaged as survivors of the Vander, sir. Put the base on lockdown. - Yes, sir. - No one gets out. Where's Ford? Sir, the last time I saw him, he was headed to the arsenal. Fuck. Whoa. They're goin' after the Vander. They're tryin' to escape. You're OK. Alright, just relax. Put some pressure. I don't wanna turn into one of them. - Breathe. - No, I'm scared. - I'm so scared. - Alright, I got you. Don't be scared. Don't be scared, don't fall apart on me, OK? I need you. They don't just die. - OK. - They're inside of me. - I can feel one going... - Listen to me! Take this weapon. And you get yourself back in that fight. You hear me? - This is across the front, sir. - How many are left? Four of them, sir. - Where's Braxton? - In the shit, sir. Get east, get closer, lock it up. Move, move, move, move! The electronic pulser field. I'll do it manually. Cover my six. Fuck! The Sarge is down. I repeat, the Sarge is down. I need medevac! Come on, you gotta do something! I'm a doctor, not a god. He was right, don't let 'em out! Know how to use that thing? OK, lay down cover! Door's not closing! Silence protocol activated. They figured out how to use our weapons in seconds. I mean, it's a good thing we were there to save the day. Shut up, Dash. The good news, uh, we got our bloodwork back and there are no anomalies. The death toll is still at 53. From the top. Four hours ago, the crew of the Vander made first contact in the Heracles system. They believe we're hostile. The Alliance Senate is requesting an update. Tell 'em I'm on it. And now the politicians are stuck debating the next move? You know what to do now. No, I don't. But she may. Some years back, a First Lieutenant wrote a thesis on behavioural biology. Please. "To kill a culture is to kill the very idea of creation. It is a sin against the cosmos to wipe out a civilisation. But we often forget that liberty is not given liberty is gained. And in the event of first contact humanity must strike first to ensure the continued survival of our species." Just for the record, I was 25 when I wrote that as a thought exercise not as a blueprint for genocide. However, the facts are still true. But what if... We don't have time for what if. What happened up there between the Vander and this alien force has set this in motion. Operation Cosmic Sin is now a go. We're not gonna wait for them to bring the fight to us we're gonna take it to them. Better them than us. But we must consider that the force that was met with the crew at the Vandermeer was a... - rogue faction of their species. - OK. Like the separatists at Safdie. Alien terrorists? - Alright, enough. - A faction that... Enough, enough, enough. Enough. Do you see these stars? You're dismissed. Thank you. Not easy, is it? What's that? Giving orders is a lot harder than followin' 'em, right? If I do this, you're gonna restore my... my rank and my pension. Let me ask you a question. You really think you got what it takes to get this job done? Ask me that again. I dare you. Hold it. Stop! Communication with Ellora unavailable. Please remain calm. Medevacs requested for west gate. Medevacs requested for west gate. Take him. Fuck! You're goin' after them, aren't you... Don't even ask. Sir, I have every right to be on this mission. I was the first one to kill one of those things. I heard it was a lucky shot. All of our shots are lucky shots, sir. You have put in for leave. You're dismissed. I'm not leaving, sir, put me in the fight! You! Are dismissed, specialist. Sir, this isn't fair. Fair? You are my responsibility, mine. Don't talk to me about fair. Take him to the brig. Wait, wait. You would send them off to war but you wouldn't send your own family? Don't fuck this up. Let him go! It's somethin', huh? We didn't know whether to burn it or put it in a museum. I'm sure they said the same thing about me. Quant fuel loaded. Quant fuel loaded. Arms up. Ready now. Icarus suit ready. Icarus suit ready. OK, so the Icarus suits are rated for terra orbital and quantum warfare. Hey, who do you think I am? Ford's drinking buddy. You never heard of the Red Rider of Puja the Slayer of Eos? Hmm, must have been before my time. How did that feel? You should know. A question about the objective do we know where their homeworld is? No, we do not. Until we get those coordinates we play defense right into Ellora. An Alliance battalion force on Ellora shot down one of their ships. Yeah, we find these ships we track the radiation right back to their homeworld. We may not speak their language but math and physics are generally consistent - throughout the universe. - Right. I mean, radiation is how we map the stars in the first place. This could work. OK. We good? - Good. - Let's go. Sir. Uh, during the attack I picked up on a large amount of tachyon interference. I think it came from one of them. I-I mean, a pulse that size anyone with the right equipment could track it and... find us within six or seven hours. So... they know where we are. Q-bomb, please. I mean, sir, you have to understand this is very unstable. I mean, you knock it the wrong way and it could take out everything from here to Pluto. We'll handle it with care. This is a last resort though, right? Oh, yes. Of course. Shit. You, suit up. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, sir, respectfully... We need a tech to handle this Q-bomb. Are you up to it? Has the Alliance Senate approved any of this? The aliens are tryin' to kill us and we're stealing WMDs and you're asking if any of this is legal? Let's put it this way. Either way this works out it's gonna be on the wrong side of history. Suit up. Mankind mastered ballistics and their species mastered biology. Are you scared... or impressed? Both. I wonder if their hosts' consciousness survived any of the metamorphosis. I mean, a larva that turns into a butterfly has the same soul. Just changed. Well, my forced little retirement. Dishonourable discharge. It's given me a lot to think about. What's there to think about? I mean, you wanna catch a baseball game? Get high? I didn't think it was all bad. It wasn't. But? You wanted to be a soldier more than a husband. The older I get, the more I just... I wanna watch the stars with someone. Well, if there's still a bar standing at the end of all this I guess you could buy me a drink. You ever do a quant jump before? Uh... Not even for fun? Look, just tell me we're gonna teleport and not explode. Well, Johnny here doesn't so much teleport you as he rips a hole in space-time and then sort of kicks you through the other side. So, as long as there's no tachyon interference we should be fine. And, uh, what if there is? Oh, well, then things will get, um... interesting. Should've stayed at the bar. Well, it's just quantum displacement, it's... It's not like it's rocket science. Ready for glory or death, General? I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. Quite the cast of villains you've assembled here. Makes me wonder if... Careful before you finish that comment, Commander. Your first instinct at first contact made you call for the Blood General. What's your point? Well, many a wise soul has said "We see ourselves reflected in others." He's a warmonger, but he's our fuckin' warmonger. I'm not talking about Ford I'm talking about the enemy. You know, many years ago I was late for a flight assignment and Ford broke my nose. I was never late again. Yeah, Pavlovian. Yeah, we're gonna hit him, we're gonna hit him hard before this war ever starts. Ryle. The boy can fight. - I go down... - You won't. If I do... Like family. The old suit's a little tight. Yeah. Needs a little more paint. Kinda like me. Someone leaked word to the press about our alien friends. It's like humanity deserves to know that we're not alone in the universe. Well, the Aztecs were doing just fine until Cort√©s showed up. Well, are we the Aztecs or Cort√©s? We're about to find out. Yeah, we're not supposed to be here. Well, this isn't ideal but I think we're in the right solar system. So where's the planet? We should be seeing her any second. It's a slaughter. Plotting a course to the planet. Overriding the controls on the suits. Sir, respectfully, uh... All or nothing. AI, change course. Activating landing protocol. Oh, Jesus Christ, we made it. Oh, fuck! Holy shit. Oh, thank God. Wait, Ryle! What about Ford? And Goss! Where's Dash? Ryle offline. Oh, fuck, it wasn't supposed to go like this! Goss offline. I can't seem to lock on to their suit. They may very well be alive but highly unlikely. You still have the Q-bomb? No. Uh, where'd it go? OK, OK. Hey, let's settle you down, buddy, huh? The alien ship is two clicks north. Let's get the coordinates of their homeworld and merc some aliens. Yes, sir. Oh, shit! Shit! Take cover! Can anyone get eyes on the ship? Negative. Forget me. Leave me and bomb them! I'm not leaving you behind! Finish the mission. Order! Shit. Here. Do it! What the... Hey! Hey, identify yourself! Hey, hey, hey, hey, weapons down! - Speak up now! - What's goin' on? What the fuck is happening? The humans they hide in, they can't speak. Say something. Get that fucking gun out of my face! Like the man said! We're friendlies, yeah? Captain Nolan. Sol Cantos. Man, you look like shit. Thank you. You a medic? I mean, I usually operate on machines. So you're a wrench. Could've just said something. Hey, hey, we've got a man down! Any of you a doctor or nurse? So you think he's gonna make it or not? I mean, I need to get his armour off I can't see his wound. So, how's y'all's morning been? That a serious fucking question? Dude... just tryin' to make some conversation. Are you guys supposed to be the cavalry? Where the fuck is the Iron Army? We're sort of here on our own volition. We lost, uh, half of our squad on re-entry. We had 300-strong battalion this mornin'. Aliens came and fucked us up. We're lookin' for a down ship. Right around there. I wouldn't, the forest is full of enemy patrol. But if you have to, cut that way, go around back I'll watch the civilians, you have his back. Uh, he's losing a lot of blood. We're takin' them over to the orbital cannon just east of here. There's a med bay, we could take him get him fixed up. Hey. You even think about dyin', I'll fuckin' kill you. God knows I'm too handsome to die. Right. Keep the Q-bomb warm. I'll get the coordinates. Eyes up, stay safe, you're with me. Let's move. More like you're with me. Fight on, young man. Fight on... OK, let's get you up, yeah? Can't be too safe. She was right. Whatever powers their ships leaves a radioactive signature. How long is it gonna take? Forty seconds, easy. Oh, shit. The bastard made it. What bastard? The bastard, James Ford. The Blood General? One and the same. God, I'd love to buy that man more than a beer. I can't believe the Alliance benched him after Safdie. I mean, it was either us or them. Can you believe that they said he was too violent for war? I mean, do they not understand that it takes a monster to kill a monster? I'm not even gonna get started on how they cut our armed forces down to a third. I mean, shit. Completely took out my unit. It's unbelievable. Coordinates recovered. Coordinates recovered. Relay coordinates to Corporal Ardene. Unable to complete request. Tachyon interference. Fuck. This fuckin' piece of shit. We could head to the orbital cannon three clicks southwest. There's a comms bay, we could get some signal out. What about Ford? You really think he's alive? Concussion detected. Please seek medical attention. Concussion detected. Please seek medical attention. Unable to translate. Unable to translate. Ford. We've got the coordinates to their homeworld. Let's get to the base and find the quant port. Just keep movin'. Just keep movin'. This is Dr Y... The invaders, they have a way to transfer their... their assets. They are parasites. They use their blood to procreate. They hijack not only the host's body but their minds. They are one army. One mind. Security door malfunction. Please seek emergency shelter. Hey, here's the coordinates. There's too much tachyon interference the quant ports are useless. We would have to go into orbit to fire the Q-bomb. Fuck! How you doin', youngster? No lying down on the job, killer. How you holdin' up, soldier? Peachy. I'm fuckin' terrified. You're alright. You're gonna miss my voice. What are you doing? He was gonna die anyway. He was... He was just... Who died? Ahem. Not now. How are you still alive? Lucky. Here I was thinkin' that we were way more advanced than them. They built this 90,000 miles above our heads. That there is a stabilised quantum space gate. That's impossible. You can't make a space gate that big. They can connect any two points in the universe. They can bring their army here? Yeah. What's the status of the Q-bomb? It's stable for now. If we wanna launch the Q-bomb, we need to get into orbit. So I gotta be the one that says it? Maybe we blow us and them all to hell when their fleet arrives. I mean, well, technically, we'd all be sucked to hell in the black hole the Q-bomb creates. Being sucked off by the universe doesn't sound like the worst way to go. You think they have something more powerful than us? They don't wanna destroy us. They don't want us dead. Colonisation? That's what we would do if we had the upper hand. You know... we could just... send it to them. We can't just surrender. Nobody's surrendering. I mean, we are in the middle of an orbital cannon. Why can't we just load the Q-bomb and shoot it through the space gate? If... if I can get it back online then... then we could, maybe. But that still doesn't answer the question of how we're gonna close the space gate. Maybe we can't. If we can't, we'll be sucked into the black hole the Q-bomb creates. But we'll save everybody else. Part of the job. Quantum bridge detected. Quantum bridge stability at 87%. Hey, can I get a word, boss? Alone. Look, I've been thinkin'. Did it hurt? This is... Nah, this is crazy. We don't need this shit. Come on, you and me. What do you say? There's no hard feelings if you wanna split. Like, really? Yeah, really. Oh... fuck it. I always thought I'd die standing with a gun in my hand. Let's do it. Oh... Hey. Are these yours? Did you lose these? - Yeah. - Yeah? Mm-hm. Are you... how did you get here? Are you here by yourself? Is your mum here? Is your dad here? OK. OK, everything's gonna be OK now. Yeah, everything's gonna be OK. The good guys are here now. We're gonna be... we're gonna be OK. Oh, wow! That looks so cool. Can I borrow those? When I go into space, can I wear them? I can't? Oh, come on. Hey, shh. We're gonna be OK. Everything's gonna be OK. Yeah, I promise. Bomb detected. Please take care when activating the orbital cannon. I've fought these things. If we leave that door open, they're gonna charge in and we can make this the kill box. Good. Hard to imagine that something so small caused so much damage. What we do here is easy. The hard part is you're living with it. You got somebody waiting for you back home? Don't end up an old soldier living a life of regret. You never know when the universe is gonna take 'em away. When you find someone don't tell 'em what we do here. They'll never look at you the same way again. Orbital cannon is online. Eight giga-charge, seven minutes. Commencing long-range comms check, 3, 2, 1. This is Ryle. Can anyone hear me? Yeah, yeah, we read you. We thought you were dead. Should've known better. Is Braxton alive? Yeah, I mean, we lost, um, Marcus and Goss. If we don't hold 'em here, Earth will be next. My suit is damaged. I still have control of the aft-thrusters. I need the options. A plasma shot from the orbital cannon isn't strong enough to destroy something that size. I know. I want to get close and trigger the self-destruct. Don't tell Braxton. He already thinks I'm dead. I don't wanna hurt him more. So what do you say? Think we have a chance? This war has been playin' out in nature for 13.8 billion years. When two intelligent species collide one is always gonna dominate the other. No, I meant you and me. It could be different this time. How many Neanderthals do you know? Present company excepted? We should expect some sort of air assault. Are you sure you can handle that thing? I've handled bigger. You're an idiot. Take cover! I... like this body. It... agrees with me. Could you strike me down now that I wear her face? Scorpions... dancing in... my brain. They use us... as... vessels, parasites. No one deserves war, but what would our kind do? They only want warriors when there's war and then they call you "barbarians" when you have sacrificed to protect them. Our culture is war. Our breeding, our prayers. The Sigea are the true apex race. We have ways to make our... great legends immortal. I offer you this one chance. Embrace us or we will become you. Nope! We cannot coexist, like you and your friend the warrior and the scientist. When you told her of your experience in the field she could only see you as a monster a butcher. You will witness the erasure of your species. Hey, boss? You think instead of, uh, stopping a war we actually might have started one? Orbital cannon, 50% power. Incoming hostile fire. Hey guys, be ready, incoming artillery. Go, go, go! Long-range stability, 98%. Collision imminent. Collision imminent. No shit. Orbital cannon at 100% power. Orbital cannon 100% power. Ready for outer atmosphere asset delivery. Q-bomb loaded into missile delivery system. Please confirm launch. Q-bomb detected. Confirm launch coordinates. Error, not authorised. Initiate override. Error, not authorised. Override. This is fine. This is fine. We never wanted peace. Event horizon established. Enemy fleets will transit over momentarily. The AI won't ignite the fuel. I'm sending you the co-ordinates for my suit. What do you mean? What do you mean? What do you mean? Listen to me. I know there's enough fuel in my suit to take this thing out. I just need a kick. Hey, kid. I gotta sign out now. Don't make it harder than it has to be. No, no. There has to be another way. If there was, trust me. Alright. Hey! Standby for a mandatory address from the Alliance Senate leader. Standby for a mandatory address from the Alliance Senate leader. We are victorious. Delegates on behalf of the remaining members of the alien civilisation have today agreed to a total and unconditional surrender. This is thanks to the heroic sacrifices of Alliance soldiers who acted on prescient top-secret orders from the Alliance Senate. Ellora will rebuild and with Earth's assistance our armies will grow stronger than ever prepared to defend our liberty at home and abroad. The Alliance remains unconquered. United... I wanna watch the stars with someone. Well, if there's still a bar standing at the end of all this I guess you could buy me a drink. May our kingdom endure for a thousand years. May the god of war be on our side always and may we continue our search for peace in the cosmos.
