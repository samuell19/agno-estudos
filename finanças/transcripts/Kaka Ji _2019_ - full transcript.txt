Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay awake! Khalsa belongs to Lord. Victory belongs to Lord. Residents, the black briefs gang were.. ..spotted in the village once again. Gather whatever weapon... ...you can and come out! They shouldn't leave unharmed today. Khalsa belongs to Lord. Victory belongs to Lord. Did you find anyone there? - No. Where did they go? We searched every lane in the village. Found anyone here? - No one? They are not here. Did you find anyone? Yes? Did you find anyone? Let's go this way! Let's go! Hurry up! Get up. Why are you screaming in your bed? The black briefs.. ...gang is in our village. Don't worry. They won't be taking Anything from here. Even if they come here.. ..they'll end up giving something instead of taking something. Look at him... he is always high on that shit. Only you consider it as shit. The black briefs gang, take this witch with you. Shut up or I will strangle you! I'm the biggest monster of this village. Talk in Punjabi. I don't know English. You scared me. What are you doing here? Wait, I'll teach you a lesson. Run away! Get lost! Don't you dare come here again! Bloody idiot! He ran away! He ran away! He ran away! Look at these kids! Causing a commotion in the village. We had caught them, but the black briefs gang managed to run away. They were bound to escape. People like you can only catch them. Only a druggie will be able to capture them one day. Stop it, druggie. You don't even get out of your house. If you are so brave then why didn't you capture them yesterday? I would have... But the alcohol they serve is very bad. I couldn't move a muscle. Don't worry, one day I'll hang them upside down from a pipal tree. Yeah, I know. Why do you look so sad? Papa, mother scared him. - Why? He says he won't stay here any more. He was supposed to dress up as Hema Malini later. I know everything. You want him to be the engine of a bullet train.. ..and you all want to follow him as its carriages. It's not so, papa. What not this papa, not that papa. How many papas do you have? I will break his bones. Listen up, you should leave today itself. The kids of our village are tricksters. I am warning you, they will befool you. Then you will regret it. He wants to be Hema Malini. Get lost from here. There you go. - Here's the queen. Buy your tickets. No one should travel without a ticket. Yes? You move back a little. Yes? - Drop me at the next stop. One? - Yes. Here. Do you have a ticket? Ticket, brother? Your ticket? Hello, brother? Brother? Ticket? Where do you want to go? Take me to the city of sorrows. We are already late. Just tell me where you want to go. I'll get down at Rongta. Here. Hold it. Yes? No one should travel without a ticket. How are you, Sheelu? I have got the visa. I'm leaving in a few days. Take it. Thank you. I hope you won't forget me. Come on. You aren't something one can forget. This is what everyone says. But no one thinks about Sheelo. Pali is not one of them. I shall always remember your favor. Listen... When I come back, I'll get buy you gold earrings. We will see. You should leave now. You will have go and make preparations. Fine. - Take care. Okay? Okay. Where is Kaka? Won't he be eating? Well, he... Just because it's a day off in college.. ..it doesn't mean he spends the whole day sleeping. No, he woke up early. But I think he has gone to meet his local friends. He has a lot of friends. Serve me flatbread. He must have gone to meet some loafer. How many times I have told him, but he refuses to understand. He ignores our status and stature. Get me a coke. Coke is unhealthy. You should drink tea. It keeps you healthy. Look Kaka, we have no enmity with you. We have issues with them. You shouldn't interfere. What will you do if I do? Then it won't take us long to ruin the respect you get. Back off or you will get insulted, the great Sardar. Those who insulted me are death. I saw Sunny Deol's movie Ghatak last night. It's still fresh in my mind. I'll tear you apart. Let's then find out who tears whom apart. Hey! Sit down and enjoy some tea. I'll handle them on my own. Come here and I'll give you your cold drink. Come on, son. Come on, let's have tea. Move. Move aside. Mr. President, give me a slot. Let me sing one hymn. I am been here since a long time. Why? Are you Durga Rangeela? Don't joke, brother. No, don't. I am quite talented. You don't believe me? All the hymns you are playing.. ..were stolen from me. You can hear them. Oh my! How well have I written! Stop it, bluffer. Come back. Come back. We will give you a chance to sing. But where are your musicians? Who needs the musicians? You are strange. I can play the music from my mouth. Get lost. Don't make us thrash you. So you won't let me sing? - No. Then tell me, where are you serving dinner. Get lost, it's over there. Over there? - Yes. It's okay. Once I become a star, I'll do it for free for others.. ..and charge 500,000 from you. There. Heard that? Here. Oh my. I wonder what stamp she owns. She even got Pali a visa. She didn't help. We went to the agent together. Agents are just good for nothing. - Right. Sheelo is an embassy in herself. - Right. She gets you a PR right here in the village. Bhullar's Gurpreet? - America. Baalu's Guldeep? - Dubai. Minder's Taja? - Abroad. And yesterday, it was Pali. What else? Really? Hey, you are just wasting your time here. Then I will have to take her appointment. Sheelo... - Yes? What is it? I heard that you grant visas. How about getting my passport stamped as well? Wait, you... I'll teach you a lesson. Wait, I'll grant your visa. Wait! I'll make you board a plane. What does this idiot think of himself? We had almost got them last night. But they managed to escape. I had caught them. Uncle, I had two under my arms. I placed my knee on one's neck and twisted his arm... Then how did they manage to escape? They managed to escape because I was duped. Uncle, they add sawdust in poppy powder these days. Even thought I pay them well. Then I got stubborn. I don't know when they escaped like a bearing. But they recognized my strength. They saluted me before they left. They said this is the first time they have come across such a strong person. He is lying, uncle. This doesn't happen even in the army. I have served the army for 16 years. Enemies kills you, they don't salute you. He is talking nonsense. What do you know about the enemy? You have never faced any enemies. Let me tell you about this great Hawaldar. Hey, stop your nonsense. How many times have I told you that I am a Subedar and not a Hawaldar? That doesn't matter. Phillu is a chaukidar (watchman). Uncle, let me tell you about him. There is a war like situation at the border. Others have the cannons ready. They horses are saddled. He goes to the tent and ask for retirement. Soldiers bring home medal. And he brought him boots. You... Damn you. Hey Mr. Romeo, if you have too much heat in you.. ..do you want me to give you some herbs? It will calm you down. Why are you disgracing us? Stick to one. You are behind a new one every day. He is right. - What is right? How many times have I told you to get him married? Let's get rid of the trouble. - I don't want to get married. I am still searching for the purpose of my life. This Romeo will find his Juliet on his own. The search is still on. Mother, soak some raisins for me. And don't forget the walnuts. Yes, I will soak them, son. You keep feeding him soaked dry fruits. You never fed me any. You get rash even after consuming peanuts. How will you manage to digest raisins? He wants raisins. Kaka-ji. Hmm? What are you looking at? Your eyes. They are very beautiful. How can anyone have such beautiful eyes? Really? How can I lie, sweetheart? I feel like drowning in them and never surfacing back. Are you sure? I am sure. You tell me what do you want? Oh, your shyness. What is wrong? Why are you still not ready? I am just about to. Listen... You usually don't value our stature at all. But keep that in mind today. First of all, you won't talk to lowly people. If they interact, you move your neck, you don't reply. Sardars command a different kind of respect. Okay. Get ready quickly. Why did you marry this dangerous man, mother? Shut up. He might hear you. Go and get ready quickly. "Folk song." [Folk song] [Folk song] [Folk song] [Folk song] [Folk song] Welcome, Mr. Brar. Hello. - Hi. Hello. - Hi. Hello, sister-in-law. - Hello. Hello. - God bless you. All good? - We managed to reach somehow. I had some work last night. - Okay. Everything else is fine? - Yes, absolutely fine. Come, Mr. Brar. Come, son. Amrik! Set up a table upstairs for Mr. Brar. Let's go. - Come. This way please. Have a seat, Mr. Brar. - Okay. Come, son. You have decorated the house well. Mr. Brar was supposed to visit. I didn't want anything lacking. Let's start then. - Sure. Hello. Hello, headman. Wonderful! - Congratulations. Hello, manager. Congratulations to you too. He is our manager, and he is Mr. Brar. Hello, Mr. Brar. Hello, son. - Have a seat. Hello. How are you? Good? - Have a seat. Come on, let's begin. You have come at the right time. - Right. Let me serve you first, Mr. Brar. Tell me when. Tell me when. A little more. That's enough. That's enough. Then here you go. Give it here. Manager, let me know when. Keep pouring, it's quite cold. - Okay. There... - Enough. Let me serve you as well, son. - No, I don't drink. Strange. I never had any. - Never? Never. - Really? Then manager, you get on with it. I'll make arrangements to get him something to eat. Sure. - Okay? It's okay. Girls... Get a glass of milk for the boy. And Ladoos (sweets) too. Girls, one of you come and give them a glass of milk upstairs. [Folk song] [Folk song] "I have contacts in North America too." "Those who would dare to stand before me are few."

"My eyes are worse than missiles, I'd say." "You won't be able to bear the attack..." "My eyes are worse than missiles, I'd say." What is your name? Fine, then if you to tell me then ask for mine. My mother named me... My father calls me Kaka. You can call me Kakaji. Deepi. Deepi. "Don't call me a bachelor." "Spend some time with this bachelor." "I will clean all your utensils." "For you I will cook lentils." Hello, sister-in-law Vimla Kumari. Hi. - How are you doing, Banta? Not good, sister-in-law. What happened? Can't cook these days, sister-in-law. Don't make me hit you. He wants me to cook for him. Tell me about it. She is getting upset over nothing. Like I doused your cooking fire. That's why elders say bachelors have a tough life. They have no fire in the stove and no water in the pitcher. I hope she doesn't come after me. "Look what love did to me." "Your promises ruined me." Good morning. Scoundrel. My job's done. "From your hill I can see Heer..." How are you, brother? Filled the river of pain yet? Who is he? He? Jackson. He is doing well. He used to play single stringed instrument with my father. Oh, okay. Hmm. But he isn't singing. He is only screaming. These aren't screams. This is English melody. Right, your father taught him English melody. Listen... Listen to me. Rikat, I am in love. I am not that kind of a person. With a girl. That you are in with a new one, very week. I am telling you this time it is true love. Really? - What do I say? I always feel happy from the time I have met her. I blush when I think about getting close to her. I can even feel her fragrance in the wind. Kaka, your reel indeed got recorded. Tell me something, is she too interested.. ..or this is a one sided thing for you? She is ready to go anywhere with me. Really? - Yes. Then get her to my shop. This one involves the soul! - Okay. This one involves the soul. Hmm. Rikat? - Hmm? Can you mimic Amar Jyot? You can, right? You can. "Lick me..." "Place me on your palm and lick me, I am your salt." That would do. Hello - auntie. Damn you, not that. Who is it? Pooja. Deepi's friend. Can I talk to her, please? Okay, dear. I'll call her, stay on line. Deepi! Deepi! Don't you appreciate my talent now? Your greeting almost got us killed. But you are good. Go, kids don't listen in. - They get spoilt. Let me just hear her. Leave, son. Go. Just a little. - Go, my boy. He was to listen in. Like I would let you. Hello? - Hello. How are you? It's Kaka. Your Kakaji. Yes, tell me. Yes, what do I say? I keep chanting your name these days. Deepi... Deepi... Oh really? - Yes. Well, I don't like anything without you. But I am doing fine. Why do you lie? I know you don't. How do you know? I stay in your heart, sweetheart. Oh I see. - Yes. Now I can no longer just stay in your heart. I want to meet you. Tell me, when can I come over? I don't know where I kept it. Someone is here. Come to GNC college tomorrow. At 2:00pm. Bye. Hey. How was your examination? - Good. - That's good. Hmm. I want to say something to you. May I? Deepi... - Yes? I had a difficult time sleeping last night. I kept waiting for the sun to raise.. ..so that I could go running to college. To meet you. It was the same with me. All the words in the book changed into your name. I could only read Kakaji everywhere. Can I say something? I never thought that I would fall in love with someone. But I don't know what attracts me towards you. I didn't realize when I got attracted towards you. But it is a great feeling, isn't it? Yes, it's a great feeling. Yes. Kaka, you know you look like a character out of Shakespeare's plays. A good person, filled with love. I haven't read as many books as you have. Nor do I know Shak... Shakes... - Shakespeare. Yes, I don't know about him either. All I know is that I love you a lot, from the bottom of my heart. It's soul deep. Deepi! Let's go. Yes, I am coming. I'll get going now. That's it? You are leaving? Yes. Bye. - Hmm. Take care. Deepi, who were you sitting with? Why? Can't I sit with him? Are you crazy? The one you were sitting with, sits with a new girl in the restaurant every day. Kakaji... You were getting scared for no reason. True love indeed feels great. I swear, I cannot believe it. A person like me fell in love? I think Kakaji is possessed. This is great. I cannot think about anyone else other than Deepi. Oh, she says such sweet things. Kakaji... Yes? - What is wrong? Why are you looking up and talking to yourself? It's about love, Beera. Okay, okay, okay. Then you are inviting trouble. Your father won't let this happen. That will leave you heartbroken. You need medicine when your heart breaks. You should remember to get me jaggery sticks. You will need strong medicine. I will slap you. He ruined my mood. Get lost from here. Think over it. It's your wish. Are you leaving or should I use my shoes? I am leaving. Oh my! You have already started to make me wait, beautiful. It is not right to make your lover wait this long. These words don't suit you. Why? What happened? Why are you saying such strange things? You say strange things to strangers. You were never close. I think you misunderstood me. You thought I am one of those you go to the restaurant with. Kakaji, I am not one of those who will fall for your money. I liked you. But you have put on many masks. Thankfully, they got unmasked at the right time. I don't want to say much. Stay out of my life. - Deepi! Deepi! Deepi! Please hear me out. I agree, you are right. I don't refuse to accept that. I agree that I have never been serious with a girl. But it is not my fault. I didn't meet you sooner. If I had met you sooner, I wouldn't have looked at anyone else. I really love you a lot. I can give you the proof of my love. I don't need such kind of love. - Deepi! Deepi, listen... Very good. Kids, memorize what I taught you today. I will test you tomorrow. Okay, sir. - Very good. You can leave now. How about some tea, mother? Is it still not ready? It's ready. Here. Randhir, how about taking some money from these kids? It will get easier to run the household. Mother, they too are just like us. Then how can I take money from them? And you cannot put a price on education. The more you spread the less it is. That is fine. But son, I thought if you have a job then I could get you married. Mother, how many times have I told you not to talk about marriage? I don't want to get married. Kakaji, what are you doing here at this hour? Why, I can't come here? - Of course, you can. Have a seat. But if sir finds you here... - He won't say anything. Make me a drink. Where are you going? - I'll go and get a glass. This isn't a glass? It's mine, sir. So what if it's yours? Pour me a drink in it. You too have invited trouble, huh? It is indeed a bitter medicine. Kakaji, you ended up needing it so soon? Yes. Beera... I wanted to tell her the truth. But she didn't listen to me, that Miss. Goody-two-shoes. She didn't hear me out. I agree that we just fell in love. But I love her from my heart. I feel as if I know her since many lifetimes. I love her a lot. - Hmm. I cannot live without her. Try talking to sister-in-law again. Will she get convinced? - She will. Hmm. Then what did you tell him? - I didn't tell him anything... Deepi! I want to talk to you. She doesn't want to talk to you. Leave. Deepi... Deepi! Deepi... - Hmm? I had called you to tell the truth the last time when we met. I love you a lot. I can do anything to prove my love. If you want me to jump into the river then I will. Then do it. I don't want a proof of your love. But I will kill you if I see you with another girl. I am yours to kill or to save. Stupid, do you really love me so much? "I am linked to you." "I no longer like anyone other than you." "I am linked to you." "I no longer like anyone other than you." "From the time I have tasted the sweet nectar of your love." "I got to be with you in this lifetime..." "I am sure I must have done something good last time." "I got to be with you in this lifetime..." "I am sure I must have done something good last time." "My wishes are flourishing." "My desires are blossoming." "My wishes are flourishing." "My desires are blossoming." "My barren life is filled with excitement now." "You made me a part of your life..." "I don't know how to thank you." "You made me a part of your life..." "I don't know how to thank you." "Select beautiful colors..." "Making colorful figurines..." "Select beautiful colors..." "Making colorful figurines..." "God intertwined our fates." "I got to be with you in this lifetime..." "I am sure I must have done something good last time." "I got to be with you in this lifetime..." "I am sure I must have done something good last time." "Holding a rose in my hand..." "I come to meet you." "Holding a rose in my hand..." "I come to meet you." "I search for you in my dreams." "I did so for seventeen years." "You made me a part of your life..." "I don't know how to thank you." "I got to be with you in this lifetime..." "I am sure I must have done something good last time." "You made me a part of your life..." "I don't know how to thank you." Kakaji has a good life. Look at the way he is hugging the pillow. I am sure he must be dreaming in English. I get hit by tails even in my dreams. Kakaji? Hmm? - Sun has risen. You can tear apart the pillow tomorrow. They tore them apart. The black briefs gang thrashed four people. One of them was a watchman... He must be like him. He was whistling. They turned him black and blue. Did you hear that, Chaukidar? How many times have I told you? I am Subedar, not Chaukidar. He is causing trouble. You ill-mannered, lunatic! S for Subedar. Ch for Chaukidar. I will start cursing with C someday. I will... I will kill him. Back off. How can you just? You can say that to someone else. I am a brave Jat! Go for it, Undertaker. I would, but I don't like to talk to disgusting people. Wait, I'll teach you a lesson. Stop. - Don't worry, Chaukidar. I will understand you someday. Let go. Let me go. Let me get rid of him. This happens every day. He says such nonsensical things every day. How are you doing, teacher? What's happening in the world? Is there any news about the black briefs gang in the newspaper? Uncle, these are just rumors. Who knows whether they even exist. No, they have caused a lot of trouble in the neighboring villages. Our village has been spared so far. Then they must love our village. Let's go, uncle. - Let's go. We need to feed the cattle. - Let's go. You are looking very beautiful in this yellow dress. Oh really? - Yes. Kakaji. It's not ours. We still haven't ordered. Let it be. It is ours. They know about their regular customers. You look very cute when you are angry. Oh really? - Hmm. You too are my cutie pie. From the time you have entered my life, my life looks beautiful. Don't let these hues of love fade away, Kaka. I won't. I am too used to you. I wish to spend all my days and nights with you now. Oh really? But we won't be able to meet for the next two months. Why? I have two month's vacation. This is difficult. How will I kill time without you? It will be difficult for me as well. But we will have to be patient. No, no, no. I'll come over to meet you. At night. Oh really? Villagers stand guard at night... The black briefs gang comes there. Not even God can stop lovers. Then how will these guards stop me? Fine, Kakaji. But you should now take me to the bus stop. Why are you doing this? Stay back for some time. I will miss the last bus, please take me there. Fine, at least tell me where do you stay? Close to headman's house, the house with two upper rooms. Hmm. Where are you going, Kakaji? How about a game? Fine papa, I'll play a shot. How about behaving like Sardars sometimes? Good. You play with papa. I am leaving. I know where you are going. I didn't buy you a jeep and an Enfield to loiter with your buddies. You are Kartar Singh Brar's son. Keep that in mind. Kakaji, why don't you hang the key there? "You don't just become a crazy lover..." "You don't just become a crazy lover..." "You don't sing without asking Rikat." That's great, brother! Amazing! You will become a great artist. Your songs will play on television just like his do. You can take it in writing. My songs are already being played. I record songs for everyone in the village. Till when will you only keep recording songs? You should start penning some hymns. You are talking about hymns? All the hymns played at the Goddess's function.. ..have been stolen from your brother. Then your work is done. - What is done? There is an all night prayer session at uncle's place. They will praise me for inviting such a big artist. And you too will be able to make some money there. I'll go and wash my face, you go and get your motorcycle. You get your motorcycle. "Get your motorcycle." Danger is sitting there with a stick in his hand. He will stuff the handle in. How much crowd will be there? Crowd? The whole world will be there. Then let's go on a cycle. Cycle? - Yes. It won't be right to on foot to such a big function. Cycle? Fine, but you will ride it. - Yes, I will ride it. Let's go then. Kaka... - Yes? I just thought of one. Keep it coming, Ritak. I should? - Keep it coming. Amazing! You are incredible. Let me start singing first. You know about the village from the memorials they keep. Really? Yes. - Then hear this. "You got scared." "You saw me and went home." Amazing. "You got upset over a pinch on your stomach." "You fell for me..." "And you got a bug bite." Awesome! You'll crush the competition. What! - Right! Oh God, what have your written, Rikat! Only you can write something like that. It's not anyone else's cup of tea. Oh God, you will kill me today. Calm down, Sabar Koti. We don't want you performing here. Kaka, I just made another one. Enough, or your songs might make it rain. Let my songs come in the market. I will rule it. Go for it. Go here. Go this way. - Here? Stop, stop, stop. Stop right here. Stop. Here? They will pray all night over here? I don't see any stage. We will be traveling in a car from here? They will take you in a car? Do you think you are Durga Rangeela? You are tone-deaf. Do you even know what melody is? Why are you involving Durga Rangeela in this? What is this mess? Why are you changing your tone now? Listen to me, Rikat Singh. I am going to meet your sister-in-law. You can practice your songs over there. What is this nonsense? You brought me here in the middle of the night to meet a girl? Yes. - I'll tell your father. Tell him. - I am going. Hey Rikat, have you lost your mind? - Let it go. Listen to me. - Let it go. Rikat Singh, think over it. Do you want to go on the cycle or by carrying the cycle? I am going. Kaka! What is this, man? Beat him up! Don't spare him. Wait, you scoundrel! - No! Let me go! Ouch! - Hit him! Don't hit me. Please forgive me. How dare you come here to steal? I am Gosha, Manda's son. - Stop, stop, stop. Who is he? - Who are you? I am Gosha. Gosha, you? Why are you going around dressed up as a dacoit? I have cold, that's why I have covered my face. You bloody fool. You know we guard the village at night. Why are you out at this hour? I had gone to get a medicine for cold. There. Forget this stuff, I will give you a peg of rum. Come with me, son. Come with me, son. It's okay. I hope it doesn't hurt much. It hurts. - Come with me, son. Such mistakes happen sometimes. Come on. Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay awake! Art doesn't need any crowd. All my insect brothers, grass and hay, and little weed sisters... I thank all of you. Without wasting much of your time... Please accept my prayers at Goddess's abode. Give me a chord. Not this one, a note higher. Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay awake! Don't worry, uncle. We won't let them go unharmed today. Let's go that way. Let's go. - Let's go. Keep walking. Come this way. "Oh Goddess who rides a tiger, please come." "Please come..." "Oh Goddess with a lion, please come." "Please come..." Brother, did you see him? Over there. - This way? Go this way. Let's go, let's go. "Oh Goddess who rides a tiger, please come." "Please come..." "Oh Goddess with a lion, please come." "Your devotees have some work with you, please come." "Please come..." "Your devotees have come here, please come." "Please come..." "Oh Goddess who rides a tiger, please come." "Please come..." "Go for it!" What did I bump into? There is no one here. Oh no, the black briefs gang! I think there were three men. Not three. There were eight of them. I bumped into one of them. There. - Right. Then undertaker, you must have broken his shoulder? Shoulder? I tore it apart. His buddies had to carry him away, brother. How so? This is nonsense. A cannon ball used to shoot out of a cannon. How do you know about cannon balls? Army men didn't even let you touch a riffle. He kept cleaning utensils, this cook. What nonsense! You cannot even stand a push by me. You want to mess with me? Kakaji, didn't I tell you that they guard the village at night? You weren't able to come, were you? And he used to say that even God cannot stop lovers. It's okay. It's only a matter of a few days. Be patient. You can talk to me in my dreams in the meanwhile. I love you. Hello, Mr. Rikat. What happened? You aren't going to talk to me? Did your reel get stuck? I said, Praise the Goddess, Mr. Rikat. No praises, leave. My sugar is upset with me? Aren't we friends? - No, we aren't. What you did to me was not right. - Forget the past. Tell me, did you write a new song? Hmm? Yes, I have written many songs. I always keep them handy. Sit down. Pull that table closer. I wrote this one last night. Shoot. "You get beaten up when in love." Wonderful. "Even the best ones have to run." "Rikat will break the head of the traitor..." "Damn such a deceitful friend." Well done, Rikat. This is great song. You will cast an evil eye on it. But you are blaming me. You will see, one day even Sardool Sikandar.. ..will come to our village to take your songs. Oh really? - Yes. Rikat, did you record Sabar Koti's songs? Oh yes, take this. Brother, why do you keep listening to sad songs? How about listening to jovial songs sometimes? You can enjoy the jovial songs, buddy. You are not my brother? - Kaka, this scheme of... ...yours isn't going to work. If those village would have caught us.. ..they would have dismantled me like a music system. How could they do that? I would have torn them apart. Are you not my buddy, my brother? Let's go. - No, never. I won't! I won't! And that's final. You are making it such a big issue? My father keeps telling me not to roam around with the scum of the village. And yet I roam around with you. I consider you my brother. And you say such things? No matter what you make out of this, brother. I won't go there and that's final. I am writing it on stone. I won't go there to get beaten up. Hey! As you wish. You have broken your brother's heart. I thought I should spend some money and release your cassette. Help you get famous. But you are only good enough to record songs, son. Go, someone worthless customer must be waiting for you. Go to your shop and die. Kaka! Kaka! Kaka! Listen to me. Back off, Rikat. - You won't listen to me? No, move back. I won't. - I am sorry, brother. No. - I love you, brother. I will go with you. I will go with you. - You promise? I promise. But now after becoming a star, it is not right to travel on a cycle. Do something, man. Will a scooter do? - Will do. Let's go then. "Dance, beautiful. I will offer you sweets." Hello, elder uncle. Who are you addressing as elder uncle? I am ten years younger than your father. If you are mistaken then ask your mother about me. Whether I am your elder uncle or younger uncle. Hello, younger uncle. He is a good nephew. What happened, younger uncle darling? Nothing. They keep addressing me as elder uncle. From what angle does he look like an elder uncle to you? His beard is still black. He doesn't have a single white hair. I am still young. - Yes. Go, mind your own business. Idiots. - Uncle, you shouldn't talk to them. Look at this. I have local liquor. Let the boys have a good time at the pumping station. Let's go. - Come on, let's go. Let's go then, hurry up. Hop on. Uncle is just 45 years old. Keep it two below 45, nephew. Let's go, uncle. Look at this motorcycle move now. It flies. - Uncle is great. Uncle... - Yes? We might not say it in the village. Don't mind it but you are old enough to be an elder uncle. You are saying elder uncle again? Young uncle, I think you too should find a wife for yourself. This is what I think too, nephew. No sister-in-law in this village entertains me anymore. Pour him a drink. It will be too much. - It won't do anything. You have such a huge body. Nephew... find a solution. It is very difficult. Don't worry, we will make it easy. Just keep drinking. Elder uncle, will a paid one work? You talk about work, nephew. It will be great. I will have dozens of kids. Your younger uncle still has a lot of current in him. He has current in him. Consider it done then, younger uncle. You get her... I will handle the rest. Her anklets tinkle here and there... Younger uncle? Younger uncle darling? - Younger uncle? Tinkle here and there... Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay awake! Stay awake! What are you doing here? I am doing what I want to do. You tell me, what are you doing in my house? This isn't Deepi's house? Even Deepi is of that kind? She stays in the next house. Oh damn. Bye, I made a mistake. We share a common wall. You must have gotten mistaken. It's okay. You don't need to cross the border. Pitch your tent right here. - Please don't do this, let me go. I am not bad either. Yes? Please don't shoot me. I am not a thief. You can ask your daughter. - What should I ask her? I'll shoot you on your forehead if you talk nonsense. Why are you making such a blunder? Calm down. I think... We should talk to Deepi first. Wait here, I'll go and talk to her. Deepi? The boy outside, do you know him? Yes, mummy. Let me go. I didn't come here on purpose. Let me go. How can I just let you go? I have gotten hold of you with great difficulty. You are cheating. When we don't have anything going on between us then... We can make something happen too. Please give in, sweetheart. Hmm? Get that witch out. I'll kill them both and bury them right here. No. What will you gain by killing them? All the villagers will berate us. Why do you want to ruin your image? She did what she had to do. We need to cover this up. It will keep our honor intact. Let's get them married and get rid of this trouble. How can I agree? I don't even know who is this idiot. What will you do if she runs away with him? Hey boy, get your parents here tomorrow. Thank you, auntie. Look, there he is. Who are you? Brother... - Sit down. Brother, I am an artist. What happened, brother? Why are you are sitting on the seat and screaming? Screaming? They are coming from somewhere else. Why would I scream? You are a part of the black briefs gang, right? I swear, I am not, brother. Who says so? Here look, I am wearing red briefs. Don't worry, son. We will make you scream. No, brother. You are the one who dismantles the motor's wires? I swear I don't , brother? How can I dismantle its wires when I can barely dismantle a music system? How can I dismantle its wires? You will agree when we dismantle your engine. Hold him! Hit him! Hit him! - No! No! I will dismantle your engines that too without any tools. He is with him. Catch him! Come on, it's time you meet your brother-in-law. Get him! There, I handled them. Let's go. Get lost. Let's go. - Hop on. Are you seated? Kaka, you fight just like Sunny Deol. Well done, brother. You thrashed them well. A punch here, a punch there. Dishoom! Dishoom! I heard that the black briefs gang came to our village.. ..and dismantled a few young engines? Stop your nonsense. Black briefs gang don't hit like this. What? - I think this involves a girl. Oh, I see. He has beaten them up with a lot of love. There you are right. Subedar, I agree with you on that. He too was beaten up a number of them when he was young. Hey, you forgot about yourself? When people from the neighboring village took you with them? We got you back from there. He got me back, bloody lineman. No one can even look at my direction in this village. If you want to see what I am made up of then stand up. Fine, there I have stood up. - Stand up. Now sit down. You are an idler where as I have a million things to do. I have to go on a tour. There. Get going. I don't need your permission to leave. He says get going. Get lost. Brother, I hope you didn't face any difficulty in finding our house. No. It's no trouble when you go to meet your family. Are you doing good? Yes, I am doing good, dear. Go call Deepi. Okay, I'll get her. 'Oh my.' 'This is Diwali bumper.' 'She is even hotter than Bholi.' 'This is a good family as well.' She is very shy. I'll go call her. Girls feel shy on such occasions. What is wrong? Mummy, he is not that boy. I won't get married to him. Why? It's the same boy you meet at night. Who else could it be? No mummy, he is not that boy. Get this straight. Whoever he is, get engaged to him. Otherwise, your father will shoot both of you. Come with me. Come on. Mummy... Hmm. Perform the ritual, dear. Yes. Here you go, dear. Deepi. Here you go, dear. Give it here. Oh yes. Here. - Exchange the rings, dear. Deepi. Go on, dear. Go on, dear. Congratulations, sister. - To you too. Heartiest congratulations to you. - Congratulations to you too. Heartiest congratulations. - Congratulations. Congratulations. 'A lady coming towards my shop?' 'I am sure she wants Hindi songs.' Do you know where Kaka lives? Yes. Where are you from? - Channa. Tell me, do you know where he lives? From Channa? Sister-in-law, you? I come with Kaka in the middle of the night. But I never came to your place with him. Most welcome, sister-in-law. Move that table closer. I'll order tea for you. - Forget the tea. Take me to his house. - You are so eager! Fine, we will have tea there then. Let's go then. They have American cows there. Let's go. 'He is coming this way.' Kaka! Look over here. Sister-in-law! She is here. Rikat, what trouble have you brought along! Kaka! At least listen to me. We have nothing between us. Please be a good sister and leave. Go away. - A sister? At least talk to me. - I don't want to. Then introduce us. We both got ruined. Deepi deceived you. She got engaged to my boyfriend. Stop it, don't lie. She is not like you. Deepi will not deceive me. Will not? She already has. I saw them getting engaged. Both of them had something going on. I suggest we too should deceive them. Back off. Kaka! Why don't we deceive them? Back off! Deepi! Deepi! Deepi! Deepi! - Hey! What happened? What is wrong? Where is the fire? I want to talk to Deepi. Ask her to come out. Deepi! What do you want to talk to her about? Tell me whatever you have to say. - I will talk to you as well. Let me first talk to Deepi. Ask her to come out. Deepi! You keep taking her name like a broken record. Tell me what is wrong. You got Deepi engaged? Yes. - How does he concern you? You forced her into it. I won't let her marry anyone other than me. Who are you to stop her? She willingly did everything. - Fine then call Deepi. I will ask her whether she willingly got engaged. Deepi! - Hey! No need to shout. We too command some respect in this village. Go and call Deepi. Hmm, I'll call her. Deepi... You got engaged willingly? Yes. You heard her? Get lost now. "Lovesome youth get trapped in the web of love." "Slowly it penetrates into their bones, this love." "Then these people heartbroken get treated in bars for love." "To cheat is a must for beautiful girls." "To cheat is a must for beautiful girls." "To cheat is a must for beautiful girls." "When they leave you after becoming a part of your life..." "They break all your illusion of love." "When they leave you after becoming a part of your life..." "They break all your illusion of love." "It is quite difficult to read these two-faced girls."

"To cheat is a must for beautiful girls." "To cheat is a must for beautiful girls." "To cheat is a must for beautiful girls." Deepi cheated me. She kept talking about Shakespeare's play. Our love was just like a book to her too. Once she got bored, she kept the book aside. Rikat! After I met her, I felt not all girls are the same. But it was just a delusion, buddy. What she did to your brother was not right. She has already done it. So what do we do now? You have no shortage of girls. Tell me? Here I am begging to you to come out of it. Come back. Hop on your Enfield and go to the city. You will see girls dropping on the Enfield's seats like berries. I cannot even look at the Enfield's seat anymore. She used to sit on it. We'll get the seat changed. Come with me. - No, man. Rikat, she was a very nice girl. Very nice how? She used to sing hymn? Be a good brother now. Please don't do this. Otherwise, you will keep sitting here. - No. Stop troubling me, Rikat. - We are friends, aren't we? Be a good brother now. - No, man. Rikat. Let's go for a round. You will feel better. You are sitting here, dressed like Thakur and wasting your life. "I can drink like no one else can." Kaka... - Hmm? Why do you worry? Why? Chill, man. It is mentioned in the fate of those in love. Lovers! Hey lovers! She will definitely cheat you. Hmm. Look at Mirza. He fell in love with Heer. - Huh? He consumed poison. What did Heer lose? She married someone else. Right? Look, now Sahiba was a good man. Sassi cheated Majhnu. I mean deceived... By the way, I messed up the gender... I mean to say that love is complicated. I mean to say that... Enough. You are absolutely right, nephew. Hmm. Now listen to me. - Yes? Sisters-in-law ruined my youth. - Hmm? With their promises of helping me find a bride. Now do you know what they say to me? They call me a bachelor. It's okay. I can get married as soon as tomorrow. Hmm. - But I won't. Why? - I want to remain single. Uncle... I don't these girls to my heart. If she is gone then she is gone. It's her wish. What can we do? Can we do anything, Rikat? But uncle, my heart hurts whenever I think about her. I feel as if I cannot breathe. I don't know what to do. What can you do, nephew? You should file a complaint against her at the police station. A case of cheating. Yes. Huh? - Yes. Mindo. Who is it? It's me, druggie. Huh, where did he go? Let me go check, what if he is up to no good? Mindo, it's me druggie? She is coming. Yes, what is it? There. Now she says, what is it. You had signaled me to come over. Wait, I'll be right back. Hmm. I think she has gone to get milk. Mix alcohol with milk? It is a risky. No problem. I can take a risk in love. Oh my. Wait, you bloody scoundrel. It hurts! - I'll teach you a lesson. I signaled you? Wait, you scoundrel. Look at me. I'll break your legs. Mindo, let him go. No Mindo, let him go. Wait. Stop it. - You just don't stop. Don't do this. - Let me break his bones. He is drunk. - Here you go. Here you go. Let him go. Move aside, let me hit him. - My legs. Let him go. - He keeps troubling me. He made a mistake. - Keep him locked. Let him go. Let him go. Let him go. - You are like a sister to me. Now I am a sister to you? You better keep your husband in control. Be grateful that Jaila isn't at home or he would have torn him apart. Keep him locked. - Let's go. Come on, let's go. - Don't push me. I had told you. But you don't listen. Why have gone to her? I didn't go there to meet her. - Okay. I had gone there to talk to her husband. Right. That he should have a word with his wife. Oh I see. She keeps signaling me. Oh I see. I swear on God, I don't look at anyone else other than you. Oh I see. I would die if I do. Wait, I will kill you. You should die! You should die! - It hurts. Take them away. You know the lanes should be kept clean. I have heard of people getting thrashed by their enemy. But I heard, last night someone was attacked by women? I heard, a few bones were broken as well. Soldier, I was cheated. I was deceived. What you did was not right either, right? What? Flirting is acceptable but why did you break the discipline? Yes? Look soldier, I don't know much about discipline. But I will seek revenge for this from Jaila. Oh really? - Yes. Come, Jaila. - No, brother. Soldier, sometimes you getting a heart attack if you laugh a lot. Death sentence to lovers. It is not needed actually. Lovers die anyway. Black briefs gang steal from eight more houses. They are doing well. Rikat, I cannot enter one house. I don't know how they manage to enter so many houses. It is an art, brother. You need to take a course from outside, overseas... From Bombay, for three years. Only after that do they print about you. Otherwise, wouldn't they print about us? Did you record the songs? - Yes. On first? - Yes. Then what? How are you, buddy? Won't make fun of me today? No, brother. I kind of learnt the importance of sad songs. I guess you got hurt. Who can know about this hurt better than you? You listen to sad songs all day long for a reason. You seem to be intelligent. How did you manage to get hurt? Fine. Let's meet in the evening? Her name was Ranno. She has beautiful inside and out. Full of innocence. She used to tell me, "Randhir, you are just like nature." "There is peace and calmness in everything you do." "And this can never be forgotten." I am sure still mustn't have forgotten. Dhira, your story is just like mine. And what was your story? There was a story. She used to love me a lot. She wanted to confess her love through her delicate lips. But she couldn't. - Why? She was mute. Shut up. Stop lying. Brother, your story is very interesting. Tell me what happened. What could have happened? Her father was a Patwar (registrar). He wanted her husband to be a government employee. I did got bachelor's degree in arts, then master's degree. Then a bachelor's degree in education. But I didn't get a job. And our love was dependant on a job. While leaving she said, "Randhir, my body is leaving." "But my soul shall always remain with you." I keep talking to her soul. You tell me, how did you manage to get hurt? Well brother, I just did. It was the first time I loved a soul. The soul cheated me. Anyway, she did what her heart asked her to do. But brother, my heart is still restless. There is a question which needs to be answered. Such questions ruin your life, my friend. Seek the answer if you can. Otherwise, these questions will make your life miserable. I do want the answers, brother. There was just one way I could go meet her. I have failed every time I tried. She must have forgotten me by now. She won't meet me anymore. You should be determined. I take up responsibility to take you to her. This time you won't fail. "I am about to meet my beloved tonight..." "My heart is racing." Kaka, is it racing? Yes, man. It feels as if my heart is beating in every part of my body. Do you even have a heart? Why, do you think I don't have a heart? You never know which lover boys these days. They can even survive without oxygen. Don't make me hurt you. I am already sad and you are really enjoying this. How can I enjoy it? Kaka, tell me, when you go to meet sister-in-law tonight.. ..what will you say to her? I mean what is the first thing you will do? I don't know, man. I just want to meet her. Rikat, I fear I might have to return empty-handed. Don't worry about that. I think Dhira is a good man. And intelligent too. Intelligent men are always up to something or the other. Right. You should just be prepared. Come, my friend. Here, wear the uniform and get ready. What is this? The black briefs gang. Rikat, let's leave. - What? From where did you do this course? I told you, my friend. I didn't get a job. I had to fill my stomach somehow. Forget it, it doesn't concern you. You want your questions answered, don't you? I do, but not like this. Let's go, Rikat. As you wish, my friend. Rikat, make sure you record sad songs for him on both sides of the tape. One side won't be enough. No brother, I don't want to listen to sad songs. I want to meet Deepi. Then get ready. Hmm. - I won't wear it. Nothing will happen. - I won't. Here, hold the uniform. - No. Hold it. - Wear it quickly. You don't wear black briefs? Who has seen them? It's just a rumor. Wear it quietly. He too is a part of your team? How are you? Is everyone ready? Yes, we are. You have recruited new people? I guess government didn't give them jobs either. It's okay. I'll make them officers. They will get fixed salaries and make it to the newspaper as well. Wonderful. Jeeta, you are the first person who is going.. ..to steal in his in-law's village. Teacher, when you start stealing you don't.. ..distinguish between your village and that of your in-laws. Have fun in life. Let's go. Quietly. - Kaka, you will get us killed. I can hear them... - Be quiet. Shh. I am feeling scared. - Come on, let's go. Slowly. Where are we going to steal? - Stay close to the wall. Quietly. Shh. Come on, come on. Quietly. You do your thing while we will do ours. Meet us at 3, okay? - Okay, brother. Praise the Go... Hey poor man's Chanchal Kumar... Control your emotions. Don't get us thrashed by the villagers. You leave. Take care. - Be careful. Bye. Deepi... - Shh... Kaka, you? Where have you been? I thought we would never meet again. Kaka, I will die without you. Stop your drama. I know without whom will you die. You were just killing time with me. You are in love with someone else. Don't be mistaken that I have come here to meet you. I have come to ask you a question. It keeps troubling me. What was lacking in my love? - Kaka... Back then you used to say "Kaka, don't let the hues of love fade." And now you wish to color your palms with henna for someone else? Just tell me how does one forget? I want to forget you. Teach me how do, I cannot take it anymore. I feel like I am dying but I don't even die. Kaka, please listen to me. What do I listen to? Your bookish declaration of love? Let it be. I was going to see you again. But I couldn't help it. I love you so I couldn't stop myself. Don't worry. I will never be a part of your life again. You can get married to anyone you want to. Here's the crowbar. - Dhira, let it be. Why are holding a crowbar? Someone might wake up. Keep quiet. Wonderful. ' - Hurry up. Damn, you guys are better trained than the army. Give it here. Hurry up. Take it. - Keep it quiet. Why do you need a blanket? Hold it. Jewelry? Don't take it. - Keep quiet. He must have kept it for his daughter's wedding. Don't take it, man. - Stop troubling us. Keep quiet. A tray? You... you don't have anything you can knead dough in? You can take it from me, we have two. Rikat, you will get us killed. We have to sell it. Shut up. Here. - Hurry up. Oh no, I don't feel so good. Shut up. You are sinning. I got scared of papa that day. I was worried about you. And what about what I went through? You weren't worried about that? Kaka, I will die without you. I won't be able to live either. We will become strangers if we stay here. Our families will never let us get together. Then what do you think we should do? Take me with you, wherever you want. Let's go, let's go, let's go. That lover boy must have returned by now? He will be there in the lane before you. He is a fast runner. - Let's go. Rikat... Rikat, have you ever been in love.. ..or have you only kept yourself busy recording songs? The kind of work you are making me so.. ..I don't think you will let me record any more songs. Let's go, let's go. - Come on, let's go. Leave, leave, leave. We need to go this way, you idiot. - Shh. What are you doing with him? Kaka, he is that monkey. Okay, so this is him. I won't let you marry this man. I have never returned the goods I have stolen. She is someone I like. She will get married to me. It will always remain a dream for you. She is my love. Forget letting you marry her, I won't let your shadow fall in her. Be a good brother and resolve this back in our village. Let's get out of here. This is about love and respect, brother. We cannot resolve it with by talking. We will be resolved using muscle power. That too right away. - Come on then. Kaka... Kaka, be careful. - Let him go, man. Kaka... Let him go. - Kaka, let him go. Bring them down. I'll take you to the police station and teach you a lesson. They got caught. - Yes. Put them in the Gypsy. Well done, son. You have made your father very proud. Didn't you feel ashamed in doing such a disgusting thing? What were you lacking in the house? That you have to resort to stealing? I will decide upon your fate and not the police. Have you gone crazy, Kartar Singh? He is your son. The one who ruined my family's honor and my reputation isn't my son. Kartar Singh! - Oh no. Please don't do this, sir. It isn't Kaka's fault. He only steals hearts. He and Deepi love each other. He came with us because he wanted to meet Deepi before she got married. We are thieves, sir. Not Kaka. You talk about pride... and you steal from other people. Kartar Singh, at least hear him out. What is wrong if he fell in love? And nephew, you tell me, why didn't you inform us if this is the case? Why did you have to cause such a mess? How would I tell anyone, uncle? Papa doesn't even like me meeting my village friends. It hurts his stature if I befriend someone who doesn't match his status. So you tell me, how would he accept my love for Deepi? Uncle, the circumstances were such. Deepi got engaged all of a sudden. I didn't know what else to do. It's not too late as yet. How is it not too late? Deepi is my fiancée. I am their son-in-law. He is my father-in-law. - Hello. Shut up. He dares to call me father-in-law! Hit him hard! Headman, he isn't my son-in-law. I will not have my daughter married to a thief. Oh great, it resolves this issue. You don't want your daughter to get married to this thief. Our children like each other. Then why don't you two in-laws hug each other? What do you say, Swarn? Why, Kartar Singh? What do you think? This alliance is not possible. Their family doesn't match our status. Dear, what will do with our family if our children won't be happy? I plead, you should agree for their happiness's sake. That does it. Now come on, give each other a hug. Come here. Very good. Soldier, they have given each other a hug. Shall we compromise as well, my friend? No way. You talk nonsense. I cannot compromise with you. Soldier, I just like to have a little fun with you. You are a very generous person. Not just me, the whole world praises soldiers. You are our protectors, we all agree. Then salute me. - There. That deserves a hug, brother. Headman... So can we go ahead and proceed with our investigation? We haven't even had our morning cup of tea yet. Sure, inspector. You can proceed with your investigation. Uncuff him. Put the real thieves in the jeep. I will be back. Don't worry, sweetheart. If I see you again, I'll turn your face red with my sandals. Then I am better off in a prison, sweetheart. Kaka? - Let him go. It is not his fault. He accompanied me because he is my friend. He will be singing at my wedding. Come here. Release him as well. Start the jeep. Let's get going. Come on Kakaji, forgive your father as well. Today I have learned that real stature means. Sometimes even children teach some things to their parents. Come on, give me a hug. You too come here, dear. Go. - Come here, my dear. Congratulations to you. Congratulations to you too, sister. How do they look as a couple? Bholi... Shall we deceive them? Listen... listen to me. Come here. Why are you jumping into a well? We will get an artist for you. From overseas. From abroad. From Bombay. Really? "This Kaintha looks good around my neck.." "..and a pearl string around your neck."
