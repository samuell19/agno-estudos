(silence) - It was the seedy dark side of Hollywood. The part of Hollywood that you just go, "Why does it have to be like that?" Ya know? - Everybody that worked on this film, we all rolled the dice thinking the game was fair, but it was rigged. We gambled with our heart and our soul and our artistic ability to make a really good movie the best we could with what we had. - We were making a movie for probably around $1,000,000 of the Fantastic Four and you just, you can't do that. You just can't. But we did. - The heart of this film and the intentions behind this film from the people who made the movie, not the business interests, the people who made the movie, their intentions were pure. They wanted to make a great Fantastic Four movie. - This was gonna be a breakout movie for a lot of us. We make a film like this about a huge franchise like the Fantastic Four, then you're lookin' at an opportunity here to go, "Hey man, ya know what? "Look guys, we got a shot." - I didn't know then, ya know, all of the machinery that had been at work. And that something so absurd like that, that all this effort and time and all these, all the work that went into making that film and that it was never gonna see the light of day. Strange. Pointless. Meaningless. - I would hear, "You know, this film was never really "intended to be a film." And that infuriated me. And I said, "Oh yeah? "You watch." (slow orchestral music) - I am Joseph Culp. - My name is Carl Ciarfalio. - Hey there, my name is Jay Underwood. - I'm Kat Green. - I'm Rebecca Staab. - My name's Michael Bailey Smith. - I'm Alex Hyde-White, I played Reed Richards. - And I played Doctor Doom. - I played the Thing. - And I played Johnny Storm, the human torch. - I played Ben Grimm. - I played Elisha Masters. - And I play Susan Storm. - Hi, I'm Oley Sassone, I was the Director of the 1994 Roger Corman film, The Fantastic Four. - Hi, I'm Mark Sikes and I was the casting assistant. - My name is Glenn Garland. I was the editor. - My name is John Vulich and with Everett Burrell, I was co-owner of Optic Nerve Studios that was responsible for the makeup effects for Roger Corman's Fantastic Four. - I'm Jonathan Fernandez and I was the Vice President of marketing at Concorde New Horizons. - I'm Chris Gore and I was the onset journalist for most of the filming on the Fantastic Four. - I'm Sean Howe. I'm the author of Marvel comics, the Untold story. - I'm Lloyd Kaufman, President of Troma Entertainment. - I'm Roger Corman and I, together with Bernd Eichinger, were the Executive Producers of the original Fantastic Four. The saga of the Fantastic Four started in 1992. Bernd Eichinger, a German producer who was a friend of mine, came to me, I think in September or October, I think it was September of that year and he said he had a problem and maybe I could help him. - I think it was somewhere in the early 90's, maybe '92, I'm not sure, but Bernd Eichinger did approach me and was interested in having Troma Entertainment make the Fantastic Four on a low budget. - He had the option for the Fantastic Four. So, he asked me, "Can you and your guys "at the studio make this picture "for $1,000,000 "and start before the end of the year?" And I remember, I just remember, it was on a Friday and I said, "Let me give it to the guys at the studio. "They can work on it over the weekend. "Let's meet Monday morning "and I'll tell you if we can do it." - Troma Entertainment was well known and still is well known for making low budget movies. The Toxic Avengers, internationally famous. Class of Nuke 'Em High has had sequels and Sergeant Kabukiman, NYPD is well known. So, he thought perhaps, Troma could produce the Fantastic Four and Bernd and I had several conversations. - The guys worked on it and they said, "Yes, it's not going to be a $30,000,000 picture, but we can make it look pretty good. I said, "It doesn't make any difference. "I just have to start shooting." - I was uncomfortable. I'm buddies with Stan Lee and ya know, we have our own characters and they just didn't seem to be very much in it for us to make a crappy, low budget movie of something that was kind of a religious thing. It really wasn't terribly exciting. Been more interesting or if I could've made a shitload of money. But there was nothing there for me other than to alienate our fans and possibly alienate Stan Lee. - I knew there was a rush on the set to start the movie for reasons that were, I didn't know. I just thought, well, isn't that always the case in any Hollywood film? You gotta be done. You gotta meet your budget and your schedule. The reasons for that, of course, came out much later. - When I was first handed the script, I assumed it wasn't going to be ours. Steve Rabner, who was an in-house producer and attorney for Roger walked up to me in the hall with a smile on his face and handed me this script without saying a word. He knew I had come from a comic book background having worked in a comic book shop for years and I collected comic books. So, he knew the reaction he was going to get. And I held the script in my hand and it said the Fantastic Four and I simply thought Universal or Warner Brothers was producing and I was like, "Who's doing this?" And he said, "We are." - There was a lot of excitement at the studio about this movie. Neue Constantin was gonna be putting in like 750,000. Roger was gonna put in 750,000. So, we thought, okay that's more than normal. - We were told this was gonna play in theaters. So, that was really exciting because when I came along, Roger Corman was mainly in the direct to home video business. So, this was a film that was gonna play in movie theaters. No one, no one, no one at Roger thought that this film was not gonna be playing across the country. - It was blown away. A little concerned. Obviously, I knew the comic book and I knew Roger very well by this point. I'd been, I'd grown up on his films. (dramatic orchestral music) And, here was a huge property. Ya know, the Batman movie had come out, but we were still more or less in the throws of Captain America and The Punisher and these not very successful superhero movies of the 80's. - What the fuck do you call 125 murders in five years, huh? - Work in progress. - And here's the Fantastic Four on a Roger Corman budget. - The time, I think our expectation for Marvel characters in movies was pretty low. I think the best thing, by then, was ya know, maybe The Incredible Hulk Show. (growling) So, that was the best Marvel, ya know, character brought to real life. Ya know, so our expectations were low. The Captain America movie. I mean, this was, for Marvel movies, this was the dark times. So, the fact that they were even in costume, the fact that there was even a couple of shots of Mr. Fantastic stretching out his arm, ya know? Ya know what, I just sat there as a fan saying, "Ya know, I'll take what I can get." - One of the worst things of my childhood in teen years was Daredevil on The Incredible Hulk. And Thor, who I was a huge fan of. And then on The Incredible Hulk, they turn him into a surfer dude who is just embarrassing. It showed that they either didn't care about the comic or they didn't know about it. - So, by 1992, it looks like Marvel finally can't lose. Jim Karen is going to do the Amazing Spiderman for Carolco, that's exciting. Wesley Snipes is signed up to be the Black Panther. Wes Craven is all set to direct Doctor Strange. These are big names and these are going to become big properties. It's sure. Ya know, they can't lose, finally. - So, when I read the first, well the draft of the script that was circulated early on, that draft embodied early Fantastic Four. I thought it was wonderful. - Gave me the script and I thought the script was great. I thought the guys, ya know, Craig Nevius, the script I thought was spot on. And the first thing I did was go to the Golden Apple comic book store on Melrose Avenue and picked up the reproduction of Issue number one. So, I wanted it to be as authentic as what Jack Kirby and Stan Lee had envisioned. - The first several drafts of maybe four total, because we move fast, were the Mole Man. Well, as I recall, there was some issue over the rights to the character of the Mole Man. They may have had rights to the Fantastic Four and it was okay to use Doctor Doom. So, the jeweler changed from the Mole Man. Whenever Marvel licenses projects, unless it's an in-house Marvel Studios project, there's a certain limitation put on. You can't just take everybody, otherwise they would have had the rights to the Silver Surfer and the Black Panther and anyone else who'd ever appeared in Fantastic Four. So, when they did this, it was a very limited right and I think it's also suggestive of the fact that Marvel would have preferred the movie never be made. While Steven Spielberg was making Jurassic Park, Roger Corman was making Carnosaur. (intense music) So, Marvel couldn't have been thrilled. So I'm sure they were not going to be generous with licensing any extra characters that weren't very clearly covered in the option in the agreement with Neue Constantin. And I was relieved early to find out that it was a co-production and we knew also at the company that when it was a co-production, we knew the money would actually get spent on the movie. So, it meant this would be a slightly better film than we were used to. Still a little scary. - It was my understanding that Neue Constantin was going to put up half the money and then Roger was going to put up the other half, but Roger's half was going to be with services. Like I don't know how much he was renting his studio for. I don't know how much he was paying some of the people who were on staff. I don't know if he actually put in the budget $850 a week for an editor or if he actually paid the, put down the going rate for an editor, which was probably three or four times that. So, ya know, I'm not sure actually how much Roger ended up putting in. - The hardest thing when you're selling a Roger Corman film is to create brand awareness. What the studios can do is, they can put Tom Cruise's face on their poster, say TOM CRUISE and that's marketing campaign. We couldn't do that. We didn't have stars of that name, but when you came up with a name like the Fantastic Four and when you create a poster like we did, which was the comic book heroes, we could compete on an equal playing field with the big boys. - We've got a first draft, a deal with Neue Constantin, and the need for a mold for the Thing. - I went in and it was mostly a body look. They took a look at me and they said, "Yeah, he's the right height, "ya know, his eyes are the right color," 'cause they want the eyes to show through the mask. And I think I was one of the first ones they called or cast because they needed to make the suit. And only one 'cause that's what the budget called for, but two head pieces. One was all rubber for going through walls and doing fights and the other one was a serval motor on the inside of a skull mask. - We had to do a complete suit with an animatronic head. We were trying really as hard as possible to remain faithful, basically Jack Kirby era where we tried to copy as closely as possible that look 'cause we kinda felt that was the definitive classic period. Ya know, tried to modernize it and make it a little bit more realistic and natural and the comics, ya know, always tend to vary a little bit from panel to panel so there's some room for interpretation, but with The Thing and with Doctor Doom, Kirby was the era that we were really kinda striving for and was our major source of inspiration. - When I went to the guys that made that, I said, "Look, you gotta understand something "about The Thing. "The Thing is, he's damaged goods. "He's psychologically damaged." So, I said, "We've got to get that in his face." To the credit of the guys that made the head, which was all serval motors, they gave that rubber face expression. And they made you feel like, "Oh my God, that guy, he's pathetic." He wasn't just a mean. So, they could change the expression where he was sad and sympathetic to like clobbering time and that was brilliant. - I played a lot of bad guys, played a lot of these guys and I've even had my head crushed. Ya know, in the movie Casino. - I got your head in a fuckin' vice. Squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit. - I was fortunate enough to be cast in the role of Tony Doggs and he's the guy that gets his head stuck in a vice and Joe Pesci spits and twists. Until the eyeball pops out. - Then the Doctor Doom suit, a lot of it was just the fabric and cloth. We just had to make like the arms and legs and the helmet for him and all those were mostly done with vacu-form plastic that we would get sculptures of the armor on top of a person. Took molds off that and made some plaster positives, the plaster shapes that we took over to a vacu-form machine and made it plastic and riveted together. Because of the design of Doctor Doom, it was okay to show the rivets, so we didn't even bother to hide those. They kinda fit the style that we're seeing in the comic books. - Wearing this suit was, is still one of the great challenges of my acting career thus far. Ya know, once it was on and the mask was on and the tunic and the cape and the belt and the gun and everything was put together and there I was clanking around the Corman stages. It was, no other way to describe it, a grueling experience. (ominous music) - So, the casting director on Fantastic Four was Laura Schiff. Laura knew my background in comics, as did Steve Rabner. We released the breakdown in November, which means we went out to agents and managers to let them know, "We're makin' a movie. "Here are the characters. "This is what we need. "There's no money, big surprise." And then we received thousands of head shots. - After we had them come in, we said, "Ya know, this is a good pairing." And that's what you start to do. You start taking pictures down from people that come in with their head shots and you start laying 'em side by side. You start looking at 'em and going, "Well, that one, that one, that one." - Jay Underwood, if I'm not mistaken, read for the Fantastic Four one time. He was a producer, director read because he had very good credits at that point. - You know what a hatchet is, don't ya, Bug? - It's an axe? - And it was maybe two weeks away from the start of production with Christmas right in the middle of that. - So, I had the audition on December 14th, 1992. Within a few days, they had called and just cast me, which was cool. I didn't have to go in for callbacks. - Heya Doc. Ready to go? - And then we were, gosh, we were shooting by, I think it was December 28th, 1992. So, it was a fairly quick process. - And I think part of the terms was you gotta make it, you gotta make it quickly. And if a producer like Roger or anybody, "You're gonna make a film." You say they gotta make it quickly and the money is telling you that you've gotta make it quickly. - I really wanted the role for Victor Von Doom, aka Doctor Doom and I thought, "Well, okay." Then now I'm gonna pull out all the stops. I went in there and commanded the space. And I came out with this character that commanded space and time. And I just went as far as I could and then I felt a surge of energy. Maybe it was Colossus himself. And it surged up through my body and I thought, "I'm scared and I love it." (laughter) And scene, that's acting. - To have an acting partner in the early part of the schedule as Joseph and I, we complimented each other. - Not unlike myself, son of a well known actor and so, I think we had a certain kinship about that. - So, I think it was that, these are these two guys who came together and the Victor Reed early relationship is a result of that. - After I got the audition, I didn't know that much about Fantastic Four. So, I needed to do a little research and I went to this comic book store and looked up all the Fantastic Four. My initial reaction was just, we see pictures of Sue Storm and at the time, my hair was like shoulder-length and blonde. I was like, "(gasp) She looks like me." So, it was that immediate, "Oh, this'll be good." - No, I got this call, "Hey, we want you to ya know, audition for "this movie called the Fantastic Four. I thought, "Okay, good." I'm Ben Grimm. Well Ben Grimm's sort the Thing. I'm gonna do the whole character. And then, when I found out that they already hired the stunt guy, I'm like, "What?" I was pissed. I was really frickin' pissed. (evil laughter) - Seems loverboy's not quite himself today. Kill him. - Even though, later on, I understand the reason why. - And Michael's like 6'5". I mean, he's tall and broad. So, it's funny, if you watch the movie close enough, when Ben morphs into the Thing, instead of being Ben morphing out into the Thing, it's Ben and he kinda morphs into, then he morphs a little littler, smaller because he was just so big to begin with. So, I just think, if it would have jumped backwards and if that suit was actually built on Michael, that would have been huge. - They had me auditioning for the role of Alicia And I went in there and I'm from New York originally and that's sort of where I studied acting and so, I was more of a theater actor at the time. So, coming into a room of ya know, Hollywood models, I was very intimidated and I was shorter than them. So, I go in there and I do this scene and I remember it was a pretty emotional scene. They wanted me to go sort of over the top and be, ya know, very emotional in it. So, I did the audition and they were like, "Wow, where are you from? "You can actually act." So, I kinda think that they were seeing like a lot of models who maybe couldn't act or something and I'm like, "I'm not that good." - So, we started casting on December first, 1992 and I know this because I throw nothing away and I have the original sign-in sheet from 1992 and it says December first, 1992, Fantastic Four. Victor Von aka Doctor Doom. And it's interesting to note some of the people who auditioned for us on this little film back then. One day, we saw Mark Ruffalo, who would find fame later on in another Marvel franchise. We saw Renee O'Connor. We read Nick Cassavetes for Victor Von Doom and Titus Welliver, who is now a huge television star. We read Melora Walters. For the role of Ben Grimm, we read Patrick Warburton. - After we all got casts, the director, Oley Sassone, he wanted everybody to just get together at least for one meeting to kinda just touch base because this was quick, ya know, I mean this is a incredibly short amount of time to accomplish what you think would be huge for a sci-fi movie, a comic book movie. So, we all go to Oley's house. And his pep talk to us was, "Okay gang, here we all are, "and we realize that there was not "the money involved for this production "that normally, a movie of this kind or caliber "would need to pull off, "especially all the special effects." - Oley had some very strong ideas about how this guy, ya know, he wanted to see the tyrant. He wanted to see the king. He even told me later, he says, "You know how Mussolini, ya know, "would stand on those balconies "and he would gesture like this and "humhumhum and then cross his arms "and he just had this pomp to him?" And Oley said, "I wanna go for that, go for it." (upbeat music) - The fact that it happened so quickly from the time we were hired to the time we went into production, we didn't really think of that as a red flag or ya know, unbeknownst to us, we had to do it because they were on a deadline to get a film shot before a certain date or Constantin was gonna lose the rights to the project with Marvel. But we didn't have any clue to that. They were just saying, "We're gonna fast track this movie. "Let's get it cast, let's get it shot, let's go." - The reasons for that, of course came out much later and I think weren't known to anyone that was involved in actually making the movie. - So, there wasn't any reason for any of us to think at this point, that there was anything else going on other than, we're making this movie. Roger Corman's making this movie. There's this company, Neue Constantin, that's on board that's making this movie and the movie will get made and come out. - You know, when you're lucky enough to work as a young actor sort of learning your craft as a padowan in the world and you can become part of Concorde New Horizons stable, Roger, and then you start working like right up to Christmas and maybe you'll have a day off, but you gotta come and hurry back, you gotta figure that there's something else here as well. - So, I had no idea that this turmoil with Constantin and Corman and all that crap was going on, ya know, I mean, put me in the suit and throw me down. - I wasn't really gonna busy myself speculating about why is this film being made or why does any film get made, ya know? Certainly not for the reasons that this one, I guess, did. - And actually, prior to shooting, one of the producers and I went up to Steve Rabner and I went over to Constantin Films offices and sat in a conference room with them and for some reason, they were really curious to know how I was gonna make the movie. In hindsight, I go, "Why did they even bother?" - There was no rumors, no nothing in the wind that this movie wasn't going full steam ahead and one of my most vivid recollections is how this film was going to be different. Everyone at the company, myself included, believed this film would get a theatrical release. It was guaranteed. Now, way up at the top, maybe they weren't planning that, but all of us were. - We're going to do some business. I would hope that it would be spectacular business, but hopes have been dashed before. But I do think we had a very good chance. - I met the rest of the cast on the first day. There was no table read. There was no time for any of that. - There was no rehearsal before shooting and usually, there was really no rehearsal when we were shooting. It was primarily blocking. - Miss Storm? - Behind you. And so, whether it was the, ya know, the going invisible and it's like, "Stand there like this. "Okay, then you drop out of it "and then they shoot it." Then it's like, "Okay, come back up." I mean, it was just that basic. - And with Roger Corman, no monitor. We didn't have a monitor when we were working with Roger Corman. Roger Corman, we had an old, ARRI BL and short-end film stock. We didn't even have film stock that had the same emulsion numbers. - We were together all the time and so, even when we weren't on set, it's not like, oh everybody would split off and go do their own stuff. We hung out together and then, Joseph, being Doctor Doom, Joseph was usually never in the room with us. He was in, I guess there was like another dressing room or something like that and he was solitary and would always be studying. - I think the cast members for this film, particularly all the leads were so genuinely involved in the characters of the Fantastic Four. - Look at you. The Fantastic Four. - They came to the set so well prepared and with such enthusiasm. - Alex was always ya know, organized, in charge. I mean, he had all of the answers. - 99,000. - 792.458. - Which was so Reed Richards. I mean, he took a real leadership role and he likes that and it was really good because you would trust him, you'd let him, he was just the absolute natural leader. - And Alex had been around probably the industry, ya know, longer than anybody else kind of thing and so, he kind of just took on that leader role. - Alex's character, Reed, ya know, I had a mad crush on. So, of course, you're terribly shy with him. Anywhere you wanna go, I'm there. I mean, it's so funny, it just still gives me goosebumps. Isn't that funny? 'Cause just that feeling of, ya know, you're so normal around everyone else and then the one person that makes your heart pitter-patter, you just get, you can't talk. - The great thing about Roger, at the lumber yard in Venice, with people like Jonathan Demme, all these wonderful folks we met have come through, is that you felt that it was a right of passage to be playing a lead role and therefore, the actors who would playing those lead roles, Michael Bailey Smith, Joseph Culp, Jay Underwood, Rebecca, were good actors. Good in the sense that they had been working, they had earned this spot. You see, you can't just be a good actor and expect Roger to embrace you. You need to instill in him the confidence that you can do it under his schedule and his budget, which really means technically, you need to be good. - This is always a scientific explanation for everything. Ain't that right, Ben? - What should we do? - First thing we're gonna do is get some rest. Maybe we can think more clearly in the mornin'. - Whether those are the characters in a comic book or not, I would argue that, "Yeah, when you're good, it doesn't really matter." Because we will make that set work. - And then there's the studio, the Venice stage, as we called it. And the studio is movie history. It's fabulous. - We were in a condemned barn. The fire marshal had told us, ya know, had told Roger, you need to tear that down. It's not safe. - And it was kind of in this little industrial section, ya know, it's not driving onto, ya know, Sony Studios or Warner Brothers or ya know, you go through the big studio gates and ya know, like, "Wow, wow, wow." It's just this little warehouse in a non-descript warehouse kind of neighborhood. And you turn in and you go, "There's a studio here?" - You open a door to one of the editing bays and on the back of the door, which they normally kept closed, is a sign that says, "This building has been condemned." - So, at the beginning, you either made the choice to go, "Hey, we are gonna jump on board "and do the best we can "and have a good attitude about it," or you're going to have the attitude that I'm gonna whine and complain because ya know, "It's dirty," or "It's not big enough," or ya know, "My dressing room's ya know, too small," or "There's ants over here." - And we did have a cat named Lucy that was a, was pest control because we would have rats crawling behind all the sound blankets. There were sound blankets all over the editing room and you'd see the sound blankets sort of pushing forward as rats would go, ya know, in the sound blankets and Lucy would chase after them and then she would, ya know, she grew to love us, so she would bring us presents. - And the joke was watch your step because you've been warned. This is condemned for a reason. - And they were recycling a set from the movie called Carnosaur and a lot of this stuff was, ya know, foam. And it does look cheap. - And then, the film would be over and we would get a can of paint and maybe some dixie cups, staple them to the wall, paint them and you have a funky looking futuristic, high-tech, sci-fi laboratory that as long as you never shoot it in closeup, it looks fine. - While we were filming the movie, they started bringing reporters around the set. The one that gave us the cover and did us the greatest service was a magazine called Film Threat. - Chris Gore was on the set for the entire shoot! And at that moment, Film Threat felt like it was gonna break big. We thought Film Threat was gonna be the next big fan magazine. It was gonna be Fangoria. It was gonna be Famous Monsters of Filmland and he was terrific. He came on set and he wrote a great piece. - I believe I was the only journalist that was on set during the entire filming of the movie. I don't think anybody really knew that this movie was happening. There wasn't a lot of buzz or press about it other than maybe a line or two in the trades that it was being made. While I might have officially been on the set as a journalist, I really didn't care. I was there really as a fan. Seeing those characters for the first time is just one of those things where, I got very emotional because it just brought me back to my childhood. The more time I spent on the set, unfortunately, the realization began to sink in that this was a Roger Corman production. So, maybe it wasn't going to be quite as big budget as say, Richard Donner's Superman. While both films are similar in the sense that they used Spandex as the, to costume the superpowered characters, the craftsmanship on the Fantastic Four left something to be desired, unfortunately. - I know there are times when you see our number and it's kind of tucked below our belt, like our belt's coming up over the number, you know? And it's just not quite right or if there was a closeup, you could kinda see that they were just kinda sewn on. - And Oley's like, "But you made these." Well, what do you think? He just really, just own it. I mean, Sue went out and sewed these if you really think about it. Sue made these. I had no idea what this costume designer had as a budget for this film, but it was next to nothing. I mean, this guy had, all the clothes, they're all my clothes, everything that I wear is mine, except for the wedding dress and the Fantastic Four thing and when we had the Hazmat, the yellow things on and the space suits. - That's when they pulled out, (laughter) they pulled out some spacesuits for us to wear. And you go, "You've got to be kidding me." Oh my word. Cheeseball low budget spacesuits. That was funny, that was funny. - I did see the limousine shot as it drove away and this big bendy arm come up and do this and I went, "Oh." That's interesting. I'm not so sure about that effect. (laughter) - Stan Lee came out to the set when we were shooting this film because you have to go back and remember, they were not doing the big budgeted Marvel movies and this was, ya know, one of his babies that was being filmed. - He, at the time, seemed enthused enough about it, ya know, I don't know what was really going on in his mind. - Between takes, he come up to me and he said, he goes, "Michael, I have to tell you, "you are what I envisioned Ben Grimm to be." I'm like, "Okay, that's pretty cool." And I, at the time, didn't really know the gravity of that, what that meant, and I didn't really know Stan Lee as much as how huge of an icon he is. So that really meant a lot. - I have to say, I didn't know who he was at the time, but then after meeting him and then the other people telling me, "You met Stan Lee?" Then I realized, oh okay. He's a big deal. - I think that he was a presence on the set. Wasn't there but Stan Lee was a presence and I think every single level production kept that in mind. - And then when we did the whole San Diego Comic Con, he was already on some other project. I don't know what it was and someone asked him, "So, what do you think about the Fantastic Four?" And he says, "Well, I don't think much of it." And when we heard that, that really hurt. I mean, we're like, "Are you kidding me?" And then we felt like, "Okay, now it's us "against the world." - People don't usually remember after they get the check. It's actually better. Stan Lee, for God's sake, he'll pretend now that it, "What, no, that's never made. "Absolutely never. "I would not allow that." Oh yeah? How many times did you visit the set of our film, Stan? You have a nice time? Yeah. He brought the donuts once. Okay? - A Fantastic Four movie in the works. It is not only in the works, it's just about finished. It'll be released sometime, I think, at the end of this year. I'm not expecting too much of it. It's the last movie to be made that we, in Marvel, had no control over. Our lawyers just gave the rights to Roger Corman to do the movie. And there will be no other projects like that. Everything after that, we're doing ourselves. - The end of production happened unceremoniously. - I don't think there was ever a cast and crew screening. I don't think there was an official wrap party even, which is always not a very good sign. - We definitely were cutting as quickly as we could. This was on film, nothing was digital. We were cutting on movieola's. So, we were workin' fast. If you start cutting on the first day, usually you have your assembly done a week after principle. And then you start working with the director. - We made movies fast, which means we edited them fast and my first sign that something was up with the Fantastic Four was the time, the duration between screenings. All of a sudden, we weren't screening Fantastic Four anymore. - They just kinda let it languish in post for some reason. And we were scratching our heads going, "Wait a minute, Roger's cut a trailer. "He's showing a trailer in the movie theaters. "But why are we not finishing the movie?" - My feeling is like, if I'm going to do a movie, it becomes my baby along with the director and so, ya know, we're going to keep working on it. Ya know, however much we can until it's pried away from our hands. - My editor and I, Glenn Garland, I had been hired before the Fantastic Four was finished to go make another movie for another company in town and while I was editing that movie, after everybody left the production office, I'd take that movie off the flatbed reels and put the Fantastic Four up. So, we were actually posting and finishing the movie sort of in a clandestine sort of operation just to get the film done. - Something was starting to take shape of an unknown quantity, perhaps a secret, perhaps people not being told all the facts, some non-disclosure, hard to tell. - I remember Steve Rabner, ya know, got a bit annoyed with me because I started calling a lot and saying, "Hey, what about stills?" And, "Hey, what about, I want a mask?" And, "Hey, when are we doing Doom's Last Shot?" - Here's to the future, my friend. - Which was him falling, ya know, into the green screen below and he goes, "Well, we'll let ya know." Really, he was just putting me off. Like, "Oh, I got a crazy actor here." - The head of post production for Roger Corman at the time was sneaking stuff out to us and getting it snuck into the lab under some other film titles. - Ya know, Roger did continue to pay me my salary and not put me on one of his other movies because I believe that Oley felt that it was very important we become very close collaborators at that point and were very closely aligned on the visual effects. So, I think he felt that he needed, ya know, somebody who was going to be his right hand man through this really hard battle that we were going through. So, we started with a FX supervisor who had got in the job on the Fantastic Four originally because he claimed to have done the visual effects for Independence Day. - [Voiceover] Flame on! - I think we realized pretty early on that maybe he was one of the artists, but he was not the visual effects supervisor. I believe it seemed that he was way over his head. - I think he was a little nuts actually. He talked a big game and he had all this equipment, but he was just a strange guy. He didn't really know what the hell he was doing. He didn't have any clue. - It seemed that he was going to try to deliver stuff that he couldn't possibly deliver. He had all this pie in the sky idea of all these great visual effects and we were turning over shots to him to start doing visual effects very early on and we were waiting and waiting and waiting and then he would send us something and we'd say, "That's totally unacceptable." So, we went back and forth with visual effects for a long, long time. - And at the end of the day, he would just kinda, he would just abandon us. - We ended up going to a place called Mr. Film and this guy, he was fantastic. He worked so hard and he gave us as much as he possibly could. We would have loved to keep working on it and making them better. However, ya know, there was not, there was no money to continue. - It was all over with. There was no more money coming from Corman. It was over, it was just, ya know, and we'd just finished it. - Hang on, Victor. - Literally, I went to Mike Elliott, the producer there at the time and said, "Mike, I gotta go shoot "a scene of Doctor Doom sitting on a throne "so Mr. Film can do something in post "in the computer world and put it in the movie." - Very good. - And he said, "Well, what do you need?" I said, "I needed like two rolls of film and a camera." (laughter) So, he loaned the two rolls of film and a camera and then, later on, we were post and editing the film, he said, "Man, you know what, "we need one more scene with "the Thing out there in the world." - So, the film wrapped production at the end of January 1993 and the next I hear, Steve Rabner comes to me and says, "How would you like to be The Thing?" (ominous music) - That was you! - [Voiceover] Told him no permit. Totally gorilla, it was awesome. - Brother! - It was awesome and hot. - Yeah and we had the two girls at the outside under the building and we were looking for any place that had light. Ya know, that had any kind of light so I could expose the negative. - [Voiceover] Hollywood and Vine. - [Voiceover] Yeah brother. - [Voiceover] I remember it well. (laughter) I would hate to be in that suit. - That was you, man. Wow. - Roger Corman gorilla shooting at it's best. (dramatic music) - We were just sort of making the movie ourselves and trying to get it done through hell or high water and get it ready for our sound. We just had to live with what we had. - Pitiful. You are pitiful. - And then I did go in to do the looping because I knew, ya know, we were gonna have to record Doom's speeches and a lot of it to really create a sound and Oley was on another gig and I talked to him on the phone and he said, "Yeah, yeah, the stuff that we really need, "we're gonna get but I really like the sound "of your voice in the mask." And when I came to the looping session and I heard it, I went, "Oh no, the sound of the mask "is not good." I said, "No, no, no, we should do the whole thing." - I have hatred. Unbearable hatred for you. - I didn't have the pages for everything and they weren't, by anyone recording everything. - Look at it! See it! - Umm, I don't know. That was a call, a judgement call that I never agreed with and I do regret that the film as we do see it now, ya know, has those sound issues and it's not lost on anybody. There are times when Doom sounds perfectly lucid and then, there are these shots where it's like, ya know, you hear him like, (mumbling speech) and you can't hear what he's saying. I've always been annoyed at that and I will continue to be until we fix it. - So I went back and did like, I don't know, two days or whatever in a sound stage doing the voicing over The Thing's stuff. - It's clobber time for real. - Of course they put a little tweak on it too after but you will notice, in the film, that they forgot to put the tweak on the voice right at the end. If you watch when Reed Richards and Sue Storm get married, they come outta the church and they walk down the stairs. It's the part where Ben goes, "Hey guys," ya know, "Give em some room." - Hey, come on guys. Give 'em some room, huh? - They didn't tweak it, so it's my voice without it tweaked. So, they forgot that part for some reason. I pointed it out to Oley. He goes, "Oh, I have to go back and look at that." - The composers came in, David and Eric Wurst, those two brothers did a brilliant, brilliant job with the music for this film. - They did a fantastic job. I was like, "This movie has potential." - And they took money out of their own pocket and hired, I think it was a 40-piece orchestra and we went into the Capital Records building in the studio where Frank Sinatra recorded and did all the music for the Fantastic Four down there and I was there. I sat in the room with them while they conducted a 40-piece orchestra for the music for this little movie. And they paid for it. They didn't get that much money to do the soundtrack. I think they paid an extra six or $8,000 out of their own pocket to make this work 'cause they were so enthusiastic about the project. They liked the film and I think everybody was doing this too for another reason and another motive, which was, ya know, getting a big break on this movie that could put us, ya know, up the ladder in the business where we could start getting bigger and better movies. - Part of the myth of this film is that Oley Sassone was the illegitimate son of Vidal Sassone and that's not true, but I only found that out about a year or two ago. Oley, he was great, ya know? He was short changed. He was gypped. He's the guy, he's the guy who would have had and I don't know, I'm sure he's, I know he's done work, he made films, but, he deserved it. He deserved this film even if it were to be taken away from him. He deserved a chance to make bigger films. - I got the sense from Oley that he was doing a much bigger picture than I had even thought this was. Ya know, that he really thought this was gonna be this big blockbuster. - So, we all were looking at it as being something that could certainly help our careers. That hey, this could really be a stepping stone and Oley looked at it the same way. - I can't take it any more. Look, we've gotta get outta here, huh? - Just maybe, this film then, could actually do something for all of us even career wise. - I do distinctly remember that at that time in my career, it looked, felt, smelt, like a break. You're gonna carry action, adventure, light, comedy, sci-fi, and it's gonna get the big treatment because Marvel or Neue Constantin is partnering with Roger. They were under the gun to make it. There's more money than there's ever been for a Roger Corman movie and we were expecting that the follow through. One thing to make it in three or four weeks, it's okay, it's not a hard script. But the follow through, the editing, the CGI, the music, whatever it's going to be, I think there was an expectation that that would continue to only get better. - So, the months went by. I did some other projects and acted in various things and then, I got word that we were going to start promoting the film. They brought me a huge box of stills of Doctor Doom. It was July 1993, film was in post-production, let's say. Probably more accurately, it was in post production limbo and I get the call from the marketing people, "How would you like to introduce "the Fantastic Four, the cast, "to the LA Shrine Auditorium? "It'll be the Los Angeles Premiere. "We're gonna show the trailer. "The cast'll be there, you'll do a big appearance." - We were screening the trailer at the Shrine Auditorium or the comic book convention. The line was out the door and around the block. - I've never seen such a crowd at the Shrine Auditorium and I'm there every few months for the comic book conventions. - And here we were, we're the guys. We're the team, ya know? There's Fantastic Four and Doctor Doom. We're signing autographs and there's fans coming up. I'll never forget, never forget, I learned a lot from Alex Hyde-White 'cause he was a really good promoter and I remember the long line of people and I'm sitting next to Alex and this kid, ya know, 10-year-old kid or whatever came up and he waited in line to get there and he got on the microphone and goes, "I just wanted to ask you "what was it like playing Doctor Doom?" And I picked up my mic and I went, "Great." He went, "Thanks." And he went off and Alex goes, "Oh God, kid waited in line all that time "and that's all you gave him." And I went, "Oh God, you're right." So, he really taught me something there. It's like, "Hey, do a little spiel, "do something for him." And so now, you see that I talk, ya know, ad nauseum. - And then, Alex and Michael and even some of the other cast members now and again would do convention appearances and I was pretty sure Roger wasn't paying for these appearances. - So, a funny thing happened to me when we finished the film. I found out that I really liked this character. I liked me and of course like, ya know, I started from a place of losing a house and a divorce and all this stuff and the part rescued me. It's wonderful and I identified, ya know? And I thought, come on, let's spread this good feeling. And funnily enough and this is when I knew something was up, Roger said, "Well Alex, I can't underwrite any of it, "but I can give you about 1,000 stills." And to this day, I probably have 150 of them left. It's me and Rebecca and I look like Buster Crab in these black and whites. My gosh, we toured New York City comic book store. We went to a convention in Florida. We went to Charlotte, I can't remember. The Thing head would be, "Oh, we can pay "for the Thing to be transported." You couldn't pay for us, but the suit and the box, couple hundred bucks would go. - So, we hired a publicist and I end up paying for it. And that's what we started doing. We started going around to the conventions and the comic book stores and meeting everybody and went to children's hospitals, radio interviews, we did everything possible to promote this thing. - If I were asked how and why did you put together a sort of a grass roots publicity tour on your own dime to promote this film, my answer, first of all, would be I don't know and as Reed Richards, I'd say, "Because it seemed like a good idea "and I had to figure out how to do it." - Alex and I, he and I are the ones that did most of the stuff and really spearheaded everything and I was kind of the money guy, ya know? I was the naive guy, I guess you'd call it, which I don't regret whatsoever. I do not regret, ya know, I spent like 12 grand of my own money. I would do it again in a heartbeat if I had a shot at it. I really would. I think it's a good, just money well spent. - There's no profit in it and there shouldn't be. The profit in it is we're giving away pictures of the movie, we're promoting the film, we're sewing the seeds for a fan reaction. - And so, it was all, ya know, the juggernaut seemed to be starting. - So, when our cover story came out, we had a table at Comic Con in 1993 and we had a television set up where we had a two hour VHS loop playing the trailer. (ominous music) - It's clobberin' time. - I can still, in my head, hear the trailer in two-minute chunks playing in my brain with the music from Battle Beyond the Stars. We had the cast of the Fantastic Four there, which ended up being a mob scene and I know that we sold, that weekend, probably 2,000 copies of the Film Threat magazine cover story with the Fantastic Four and everyone at that table, ya know, the whole cast, they were so nice to everyone. In particular, Michael. He would sit and talk to every person and I remember him saying when people asked him, "So," 'cause you know how comic book fans can be sometimes, very skeptical. "Well, so is this Fantastic Four movie "gonna be good? "Is it gonna be any good?" 'Cause you remember Marvel's reputation at the time. Michael just looked him right in the eye and he would just say, "This Fantastic Four movie is gonna be great." - Are such things as dreams are made of. - I had heard about a big screening. In 1993, I didn't know much about the Mall of America, so I didn't know what it exactly meant but, a public screening of the film meant a lot. - We were going gang busters, ya know, train's moving forward. We were settin' up all this stuff for the premiere at the Mall of America. All these different radio and television local and national affiliates were all tied in. Ronald McDonald House, Children's Miracle Network, we had all this stuff, all the cast and crew. We knew the cast was gonna be there for sure. Oley was gonna be there. - Confidence was still pretty high, even though within that world were signs that this is not, whatever sense of urgency there was is over. - The film was done. So, all of us are startin' to get excited again. - We had what we thought were as good of visual effects as we could afford. We went to sound. We were getting everything ready. Roger was talking about releasing this on, I think he was talking about like 500 screens. - The cast was gonna be there live. It was just, it was kind of exciting. It was kinda like in the old days, ya know? - So, we were countin' down to the end of '93 and somebody said stop. - The film was actually going to premiere at the Mall of the America's, I think, in Minneapolis, but I don't think anything ever happened of it. I think somebody was trying to do something without paying attention to who had the copyrights. - As much as, ya know, I would wanna be Robin Hood or Jesse James, at any point in my life, this was the point. So, I went out in full knowledge that I was gonna promote myself and this character and this story. It was about, let's do the right thing as a storyteller, dare we say artist, and in order to do that, we had to construct a business scheme and arrangement and that might have scared Neue Constantin. I shouldn't think it scared Bernd Eichinger, but it might have scared somebody at Fox and the middle management and Chris Columbus was the wunderkind. Chris Columbus was a Fantastic Four fan. Fox wanted to give something nice to Chris Columbus, so all of these other pieces of information that had nothing to do with us. None of this is malicious. This is Hollywood. - I got a call from Oley saying he just got a notification to cease and desist on all promotional stuff. And I'm going, "What's going on?" - Ya know, once again, it was another blow to all of us. - I think I might have talked to Alex about it and that was it. I mean, there was nothing else we could do. It just ended. - I got this call from Oley and he said, "I hate to tell ya this but, "the film's not going forward. "It's not gonna be released." - And I go, "Ah man, is it?" He goes, "Yeah." I go, "Alright." Fuck. Alright. - And then to find out then that wait a minute, this was planned from the beginning, was the initial understanding. So in other words, this movie was never meant to come out. - We were very surprised because the thing is, they finished the movie that if contractually, all he had to do was be in production, he could have started it and then bagged it. Why spend that extra time and money and a lot of people's just sweat and blood? - Neue Constantin had this clause in their contractual agreement with Marvel and I guess with Corman as well that they had the right to seek other avenues for another production and they had been wrangling with 20th Century Fox to do that and they made their deal. So, now they're gonna exercise their right to shelve this film and go work on a big budget version. - Somebody wrote a check and it probably had Mr. Eichinger's name on it. And everybody above us was satisfied. Fox, Constantin, Marvel, Perlman, Roger, whoever was at Fox that was scared witless because some barnstormers in blue suits are out there trying to pinch his project. - I don't know. I was a bit stunned, ya know? I was a bit, this doesn't make sense. Is this sort of a lag or the idea that it would not be released in any manner, that it would be shelved, that it would never be seen is hard to imagine. - I was called into the post super's office and told that the negative was being transferred out of the lab and that Roger no longer owned the print. And so, that, that was crushing. - And then, once they took the movie away from us, then we were ya know, sort of like, the wounded and ya know, and then I said, "Wait a minute, "why, we're gonna let them take this movie "away from us and not get anything out of it? "We gotta show people that we made a movie. "That's how you get another job." You gotta show 'em. You know, look, where's your movie? Oh, you just made a movie? Where is it? Well, I don't really have a movie. Well then, you didn't really make a movie. Well, yes I did, but I don't have it. Well then you didn't make a movie. So beat it. So I said, "We gotta get that movie." So I remember Glenn Garland and I were sneakin' around in Roger's storage room in Venice looking for the can to that film. After everybody had gone, we were in there like almost like in a like, with a flashlight ya know? Like criminals, we were going in there and we were gonna risk criminal prosecution for taking that print and going over to a post house and having it telecined so we could have a decent copy of the film. But low and behold, the film was already gone. There was no prints left around. They had confiscated everything. The negative, the work prints, the answer print and we had one answer print made from the movie, just one. And we never could find it and that was that. - Then they had to construct a story about that. And the story about that became, you know this movie was never intended to be made. It was always a way to secure the rights for Marvel 'cause they were going through great trouble and Chris Columbus or somebody of immense talent needs to make this film because it's a profitable franchise and they don't want the river to be polluted. And they were all scared of it. This great myth sort of became self justified. Look, it's like a conspiracy theory. We all try to react to shock by constructing this grand plan that requires somebody to be in charge who has the talent to do that and it's the wrong place to look for that in this project. It just had it's own destiny and when it hit that fork in the road and went to the place of denial, you know it's in a vault in Kentucky. Don't you think when they finished making the new Fantastic Four's that they might dust this one off and ya know, with it being 80 years old, be like the Lone Ranger going, "You know, that was really good?" I'll be telling the same story I'm telling now. Is that by trying to help this film succeed in the conventional way, we probably quite likely sewed the seeds for it's demise in a most unconventional way. - To Bernd Eichinger's credit, he did call me and I went up to his house in Beverly Hills and sat with him, ya know, in his living room and had a cup of coffee with him and he told me exactly what happened and to his credit, he said, "Look, I'm gonna tell you "what the situation is and why this movie was pulled." And he explained to me the deal with Marvel, that it happened this way and he was sorry that, ya know, I was involved and everybody else's effort was for not. But, that was it and he told me just simply it was a contractual issue between him, or between Constantin film and Marvel and that was it. And then asked me if I wanted some more coffee. - What have you done? - I felt, I didn't know what to do. I felt like, ya know, who do you go after? How do you, ya know, I'm Sicilian, so I got that thing in me that says, "I wanna go fuck somebody up for this," ya know but, you can't do anything. Because I knew all that work, all the effort, all the sweat, all the sneakin' around doing the post, all the work that the actor's did, the special effects and that everybody's blood, sweat, tears, heart, soul effort that went into making this little movie just, they just flushed it down the toilet. It was gone. Gone, that's it, didn't happen. What you guys just did did not happen. - Why all this mystery? - I think if you're gonna pull a con, you just don't tell people it's a con until you run away with the bag of money. Oh my God, did we just get conned? That son of a bitch. - We just made this movie that we're all hoping would have gotten us a leg up in the business and they just pulled it from under us and that was that and no additional compensation, no, "Hey Jay, ya know what, "maybe we'll compensate you guys down the--" Nah man, it was like, "Sorry, it's over, goodbye." - How many movies did Roger Corman make and never release? One. - Why not release the film? It's certainly gonna make you some money. We certainly wouldn't have done the appearances and the comic book conventions and Corman would not have, ya know, printed up, ya know, all these posters and head shots and spent all that money. So, I think he probably, as a big good businessman, he said, "Fine, I'll take the money and I'll "cut my ties with this thing and let it go." And that's hard cold truth of Hollywood, I guess, ya know? - Ya know, Roger called me after the fact and said, ya know, "Oley, I wanna thank you. "I just got a check for $1,000,000 from--" And I was going, "Gee, that's great Roger." And the movie then went off the shelf. It was gone, they pulled it. And I think it was because, and that's just, it only makes sense, that he used the finished film as a little more leverage to collect a bigger paycheck other than just the production expenses that he was paid in his markup on a production expenses from Constantin. So, it was apparently, everybody did well with the movie except us. Except the ones that made the movie and the one that acted in the film and we all just get, ya know, kicked in the teeth and that was that. - At the time, ya know, one just deals with the realities. Finally, it's over. Okay and we're not gonna have the premiere and then, you know, later, the conspiracy aspect of it, the business sense aspect was rather interesting for me to try to unravel and I think it's come down that Avi Arad was the one person who knew what he was doing in this. - In October of 1993, Avi Arad has his first really big success. He sells the rights to the X-Men movie to 20th Century Fox. He's already had a working relationship with Fox because he was heavily involved with Fox Cartoon on Saturday Mornings. (intense music) And Avi Arad is really eager to make movies and really eager to make big movies and when he finds out that there's a low budget Fantastic Four movie coming along, ya know, maybe he's not that excited to see what's gonna happen with it. Maybe he would rather just call the shots on every movie that has anything to do with Marvel. When Avi heard this, he went to the telephone and ya know, the details of the conversation he had and specifically who he was even speaking to are maybe up for some debate. - I don't think Roger really knew from the beginning. I think he was duped just as much as we were, which is really sinister. But ya know, if you've got a secret that you need, it's a life and death secret or either to keep the franchise or lose the franchise, you don't tell anybody. You can't afford to do it. And that's what they did. I mean, it was lockbox, ya know? It was, this is it, we're not lettin' this secret out. If we do, we're gonna be nuked, ya know? So, I think that's ya know, the importance of them not telling anyone, including Roger, that this thing was gonna be doomed. - Avi, I think, wanted control of Marvel. In order to save it, look what's happened. I mean, you look at it that way, my gosh, what a wonderful sort of cog in the wheel. - I might be even betraying myself in our own movie for saying it but, I kinda see Avi Arad's perspective on it. They wanted to come out with this franchise, ya know, big and with a splash. In a way, maybe Marvel is not really the bad guy so much as it is Constantin Film because maybe they were secretly hoping that they didn't make the movie. Ya know, so they could get the rights back and go do it elsewhere because in the end, Marvel Productions and what they've become today made them billionaires. (intense music) - Roger, about 16 months later, he gave me a film to do. - [Voiceover] Unknown Origin. Starring Alex Hyde-White. - Yeah, they really liked what he did for them and that made it okay. - After that, Bernd Eichinger, I was up for a film to direct in Prague and my agent sent me over there and I interviewed with these guys and I think Bernd said, "Hire Oley because he's good and he's fast." And I gotta tell ya, going to Prague and making a film was one of the best experiences of my life. That was a great, great experience and the film turned out really, really well. Then when we were posting the film in Munich, I happened to walk into a restaurant with the editor and we went there to eat and Bernd Eichinger was sitting against the window having dinner by himself. And I went over to say hello to him and he goes, "Oh Oley, how's the film? "Everything good?" I said, "Yeah, it went well, man. "I wanted to thank you for ya know, "at least throwing me a bone." (laughter) And so, we sat down to have dinner and the next thing we know, Bernd Eichinger sent over a bottle of Dom Perignon. (laughter) - The irony of the Fantastic Four movie is that it has been seen by more people than probably would have ever seen it in it's initial release had it been released. This was the great irony because before long, tapes were circulating in underground comic book conventions. - I went to a convention. There's rows of people that are signing and rows of movies and stuff that are just kinda stacked up and well, I was just kinda floatin' around and I-- picked this thing up and I went ah, this is me! Wow, that's really cool and I said, "Yeah, when did you guys get this?" He said, "Oh, I think it's been floatin' around "'cause I can't get a real copy." He said, "Would you like that?" I said, "I'd love it." He goes, "10 bucks." - I was at a party and this guy comes up to me and goes, he goes, "You look so familiar to me. "I know you, I know you." Throughout the party, he was trying to figure it out and finally, he comes up to me and he goes, "You're Alisha!" And I'm like, "Yes." And I go, "How do you know? "Did you work on the movie?" He goes, "No, I saw the movie." I'm like, "Where? "I haven't even seen the movie." So, he told me that there are copies on Ebay and so, ya know, that night, I went home and I bought a copy on Ebay. - Somebody had told me that they were at a comic book convention. They bought me a copy and I was like, I was kinda thrilled that ya know, all that hard work at least was gonna get seen by somebody, by some fan was going to see it as like something special that ya know, the lost tapes. - Where copies started coming from, who knows? But in any case, they started showing up. And so, what you started to see happen was, you started to see this little surgence of fans, comic fans, that were starting to see the movie. - So I got the copy of the film and I took it to Lightning Dubs and one of those places that just ya know, does a lot of dubbing work for the TV networks and such and I said look, I just want a couple copies of this movie. And I think that's where it got leaked out. I think somebody, one of these guys that work there at night doing dubs ya know, in the middle of the night saw the Fantastic Four and went, "Holy shit. "I'm gettin' me a copy of this." So, they made, ya know, two for me and one for them. So I think those are, whoever that is, ya know, wherever he is, God bless him because they got the film out there. - I think the film was never meant to be released. I think the film was a way for the producers to extend their option on the material at a very, very low cost and I think that this was a development cost. I am a writer, I've seen scripts be written and then thrown away and this is the equivalent of that. This was just a draft of the film that was tossed away and it's written off on production cost. - The story that I heard was that Avi Arad was in Puerto Rico and he was talking to this kid who said, "Are you gonna be, "ya know, going to that Fantastic Four premiere?" And Avi said, "What Fantastic Four premiere?" - Marvel does have the movie. They own it, ya know, that it's, for all we know, I think the comment from the fella who ran Marvel or runs Marvel is that ya know, "Yeah, we burned it "or it got burned or something." But it's probably, we would imagine in some film vault somewhere. I can't imagine they, ya know, burned it. Ding dong. - My guess it it's somewhere, that they wouldn't be that cruel as to demolish a piece of celluloid regardless of what's on it. Because if you believe that they have even an ounce of film maker inside their blood, they're not gonna destroy film. Ya know 'cause that's not what we do. People don't destroy film if you're a film maker. You try to preserve film. So, my guess is that somewhere, that negative is still preserved and tucked away somewhere, I would hope. - What's the harm? There are Criterion Collections. There are reboots of old Hugh O'Brian, "Have Gun - Will Travel." There's all sorts of things out there. The niche market has been created, alright? Why wouldn't there be a warm welcome for this film and that's a very good question and I think the question itself gives you the answer. It's a yes, it'll come out. When it is viewed as a tangible asset by whoever is left over. - The perfect offering. - Somebody's gonna find this. Somebody's gonna find this project. The great untold, never seen version. The original Fantastic Four. You tellin' me that wouldn't sell a few DVD's for cryin' out loud? (intense music) The fact that it never was released, that doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. It's about giving this film it's third act and I'm sure it'll happen and I hope that when my 12-year-old grandchildren are old enough in the early 21st century that it does happen, that they'll remember, "That was your great grandfather." 'Cause it's not gonna happen now. - It'll certainly, ya know, make some money. They'll make some money. You'll make some money on it. People will buy copies of this DVD or downloads, whatever it's gonna be. Or put it on a special features with ya know, the other Fantastic Four movies. I don't know. It just seems like it needs it's due and there's people out there ready and waiting to get it. - Patience. - It's too bad that in today's world with the options of media play that it can't find a home or hasn't found a home yet. But, ya know what, it's all about this. - I've said to this day and I'll go on record as saying, if we ever can, people will see fit to release this film, I'll go back in and redo any of the Doom speeches to get it all nice and perfect but, I'm not holding my breath. - It's a shame because I think what they should do is take the film and release the film in it's original state and I would hope that because of the CGI that's out there today, take the film and everywhere there's a CGI effect in the original film, see what the film really could have been if we had a little bit more money to make the CGI equivalent to what the CGI is today. Then, release it as a double, ya know, DVD. They would make a fortune. The fact that the film never got the treatment that it should have gotten, even in post, was like another stab in the heart because you said, "Damn, we made a good looking movie." Ya know, and what do we get for it now? We've got ya know, bootleg copies, which is VHS to VHS 10 times and that's what people see. They go, "Yeah, that movie. "Well ya know, it's okay but it looks like shit." Well, no wonder it looks like shit. I know that when they did the telesinny for the trailer, in which was a negative transfer to tape and man, it looked awesome. It really looked good. - I look back and in some ways, because of it not coming out, I think it has had a bigger life than maybe if it did come out. - My kids, I have two boys, ya know, they protect their Dad as much as possible. So, they knew what happened with the Fantastic Four but even like with the new, the new bigger versions came out, they said they wouldn't go see 'em 'cause ya know, that would be like them cheatin' on their Dad. - Is it the perfect definitive? Fantastic Four movie. No but we did our damn best job that we possibly could with the resources we had to make that happen. - Nobody ever thought that it would have this kind of life but, I'm really glad that it did. It's really the audience. This film wouldn't be around if it wasn't for the comic book fan base because they're the ones that have kept it alive all this time. It wasn't really anything that we did. It's the fact that they wanted it and they kept wanting it and they seem to still want it. - In the end, ya know, this is a, I think it was a great blender on their part. I think ya know, they took 10 years or more to make another Fantastic Four movie in the meantime. None of us reaped any benefits from making this film, except my son, ya know, who I gave him the tape when he was probably about three-years-old and he started watching his old man playing Doctor Doom. And running around the house with his action figure and imitating my laugh, imitating the lines, right to a T and I suppose that gave me more joy than probably anything. I don't feel bitter about it or anything like that. Ya know, it was a job. I did, I think, I did my utmost to bring it to life. I did my part. I'm proud of it, ya know? I got to be the first Doctor Doom. Nobody's gonna take that away from me. It would just be nice to see it a little further out there so the public could have a laugh. - Ya know, I was angry the first day I heard that the thing was being pulled from Bernd Eichinger. You just, you take what you can get and we got an opportunity to make a movie about the Fantastic Four and I never lost the feeling that we had when we were hired to do the film because it was the Fantastic Four. So, I don't, no I'm not bitter about it at all, frankly, and I'm not angry about it. Ya know, yeah, you can't just go around thinking about what if's, ya know? Because that's over, ya know, you gotta let go of the past and embrace the future. That way, you can live in the present. Ya know and that's what we do. I mean, it's the movie business and life is not fair. It's like, ya know, forget about it, Jake. It's Chinatown. (slow music)
