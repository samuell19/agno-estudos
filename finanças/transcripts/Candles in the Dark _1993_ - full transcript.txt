[rock hits star] [music stops] [wind blowing] The Baltic situation took another turn for the worse last night with major unrest on the streets of Tallinn, Estonia. [over T.V.] A popular demonstration was broken up by the Russian forces. [Arkush] I agree whole-heartedly. I assure you kommissar. You cannot allow such a riot again Arkush. No matter what. This entire country sits on dynamite. Every ethnic group is watching the Baltics now. Stupid Gorbachev and his idiotic Glasnost. He's the fool that started all this and we have to crush it. [Arkush] Yes sir, but arresting their leaders at this time would be a serious mistake. [T.V. turns off] The riot was very spontaneous.

At least you should respect the curfew. I don't care about the curfew. The Pastor has decided to split up the organization to increase security. And suddenly I find myself isolated from the decision makers. -They suspect you? -I don't think so. It's just security precaution. Since you had the Pastor and Jaan arrested. -So it's your fault darling. -In other words you failed me.
