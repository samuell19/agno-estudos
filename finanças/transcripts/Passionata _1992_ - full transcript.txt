(MultiCom Jingle) ("Sonata in F, 3rd Movement" by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) (audience applauds) - [Pianist] Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you, thank you, thank you. (speaks French) I can't, I couldn't possibly. There you go, thank you, okay, just one more. Just one more. I'm glad you liked it, there you go. Thank you, thank you, this is the last one. No, I can't, thank you very much. - Your encore was beautiful. - Thank you. Would you like me sign that? - No, no, I don't think so. - Well, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to imply that, um... Well. Goodnight. - Alan? - Liana? It is you! - Yes, yes it's me! - Hi! - Hi! I heard you were in town and I had to hear you play. Oh, it was beautiful, breathtaking. - [Alan] Thank you. How are you? - Well, I'm well. Do you know it's been 10 years? - God. (chuckles) - So, are you still living in France? - I am. (Liana chuckles) Look, I've got a little time. Would you like to get a cup of coffee or a drink? - Sure! Sure. I know a place just down the street. They have great cappuccino. But if you'd rather go for a drink-- - No, coffee, coffee's fine. Well, hop in. - But it's just down the street. - This is LA, you're not supposed to walk in LA. You're supposed to drive everywhere, aren't you? - Alan. - What, you don't wanna go for a ride with me? - No, I can't get in there to go half a block. You haven't changed at all. - Actually, I have. - Really? - I'm older. - You're also married. - Yes, well actually, no. I was married. - Then what's the ring for? Oh no, I'm being nosy. - That's okay. What about you? - His name is George. (Alan speaks French) (Liana chuckles) (Liana speaks French) (Alan chuckles) - Do you remember when I beat you at juries? - No. - Oh, come on. - Nobody ever beat me. Shh, shh, shh, keep it down. How could I forget? - Okay, here's your latte, and here's your cappuccino. Can I get you anything else? - No, I'm fine. - Thank you. - Okay. - You're always so competitive. - Me? - Yes, you. - I was not half as competitive as you. And you've made it, you're a star. - No, I don't know about that. - You are. You're terrific. - How about you? - I'm fine. Maybe a little bored. I'm not a famous concert pianist. - But what do you do? - Well... - [Alan] Well, what? - I have a husband. - So? But what about your music? - I play piano at home. - But what about your music? - Don't be obnoxious. - Sorry. Did we ever like each other? - (chuckles) I don't know. You were such a monster. - Me? (laughs) - Yes, you. You were always on my case. I always had to watch out for you. - I thought you were admiring my body. - Oh, spare me. (Alan chuckles) So, that's why you kissed me. - I kissed you? - Yes. - I don't remember that. - Oh, Alan, please! - Oh, I remember. Right before graduation. - In Washington Square. - Under the bridge. - In late spring. - I caught a cold. - You did not. - I almost died. - You're a liar. - And you look great. - I do not. Thank you. - Why did you stop playing? - I play. - Not seriously, not with those nails. - Yes, I do. You know, I would have thought that maybe by now, you would have changed just a little bit. You're still, kind of... - A jerk. - Yes. No. You're commanding. It works for you on stage, you're very commanding on stage. Off stage, it gets tiring. - I know. It's a show, Liana. Underneath it all, I'm really a regular guy. - Who loves motorcycles. A Harley-Davidson, wasn't it? - You remember that? - There's still a certain charm to the image. (chuckles) It's good seeing you again, Alan. - It's good seeing you, too. I've often wondered what became of you. - Really? - Really. I'd like to see you again, before I leave. Lunch, maybe. - How about my place? - I'd like that. Well... (sighs) Am I gonna meet your husband? - Who, George? - You have more than one? We haven't even talked about him. - I know. - I'd like to meet him. - Maybe you will. - What're you doing? - This is my treat. - Okay. Can I give you a lift? - This is America, Alan, I have a car. I'll call you. (door bell rings) (knocks) (door bell rings) (sighs) (knocks) (sighs) Hi! - (chuckles) Hi. Come in! - I brought these for you and George. - Oh, they're beautiful. Thank you. George won't be here. - Oh, that's too bad, I was looking forward to meeting him. - Well, maybe next time. Well. - [Alan] Hey. (high-pitched piano notes) (Liana chuckles) - Well, let's go eat. - Wow! - I hope it will do. - Do? It's a, it's a feast! - Are you hungry? (Alan laughs) - Mm-hm! - That's a yes. It's a beautiful day, let's eat outside. (peaceful orchestral music) - Mind if I play? - I'd be honored. (Alan laughs) - Here. ("Waltz in A Flat" by Johannes Brahms) - That was nice. - I love Brahms. One of Catherine's favorites, too. - Who's Catherine? - My wife. - Oh. - She died three years ago. - I'm sorry. - (sighs) You play something. What's the matter? - I... - Liana? - I can't. - Why not? - I don't know, Alan, please. - What's wrong? (footsteps approach) - George. My husband, George. (Alan chuckles) George, this is Alan Spencer, my friend from Juilliard. - I understand you're doing quite well for yourself. George Buckman, good to meet you. - Alan Spencer. - May I talk to you a minute? In private? - Now is not the time. - Well, I think we should make it the time. With Mr. Spencer's permission. - Uh, well, I'm late as it is. I've gotta go, um... It was a wonderful lunch. And I'll see you tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Tomorrow? What are you doing tomorrow? - We're going on a picnic. - A picnic. - A picnic. - So, I'll pick you up at 11, huh? Bye. - Bye. - Nice meeting you. - Mm-hm. I don't like him. I said, I don't like him. - I heard you. Why are you here, George? - To get the rest of my stuff and to leave you the keys. - And to spy on me? - No, but I didn't expect this. - What are you concerned about, a scandal? - We're not divorced yet. They might ask me to run again. - Get your stuff and get out. - Look, can't you understand my position in this? - How dare you walk in on me. - You and your friend didn't hear me knock, because of that damn piano! - It's nice to hear it played again. - Oh sure, especially by your pal, Liberace. - Oh, stop it. My friends are my business now, and don't start with the piano. - I'm not! - You are! You hate that piano, you always have. And you hated me when I used to play. - I never stopped you from playing. - Oh, yes you did. You made it very clear. Every time I played for anyone, it led to a fight. - You only did it to hurt me! - George, that's not true. I tried to be good to you. - Well, maybe you just didn't try hard enough. - Maybe I just got tired of being window dressing to your career. - Politics demands sacrifices, you know that. - I made sacrifices, George. I gave up a lot for you. My music. Everything. (melancholic orchestral music) - I gotta go, I've got a meeting in the morning. - George, before you go. - Oh no, you keep it. - No, it was your grandmother's, it belongs in your family. - And I thought you belonged to me. For better or for worse? - George, that's not fair. Do you want the divorce or not? - Enjoy your picnic. I'm sure he will. ("Piano Sonata No. 11" by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) (jurists applaud) (restrained piano music) (motorcycle engine purrs) (peaceful orchestral music) - Where did you get that? - I bought it. They're outrageously expensive in France. I thought I'd ship it over. Get on, you're wasting time, come on! You ready? - Yeah. (upbeat pop music) (peaceful electronic music) - That rock's a little slippery. No, no! (Liana yelps) (Liana chuckles) - Don't you dare. Don't try it. (giggles) - Picnic? (upbeat pop music) (peaceful electronic music) - [Liana] Thanks. (giggles) - You hungry? - Yes. It's nice here. A Harley rider. - Huh? What? - I said, that bike was fun. - Admiring my body again, huh? - No. No. - "No." "Oh, no, no, no." Hold this. - Alan, this is wonderful. I can't believe you brought all this. - I hate to bring this up, but um... - [Liana] George? - Yeah. - We're in the middle of a divorce. - [Alan] Thought as much. - Actually, he's divorcing me. But he's acting like he wants me back, but I don't want him anymore, it's weird. I don't know. I've been smothered, Alan. My dreams were smothered. And everything that has to do with us is falling apart. I don't know, C'est la vie. (Alan speaks French) (Liana chuckles) - I'm sorry. - You don't need to be sorry for me. - Yes, I do. You deserve better. - You're a very gentle man. - What are you doing? - [Liana] It's illegal to drink in the park. - But that's champagne. - I know, but-- - It's French champagne. - Alan, shut up. We can get arrested. - Oh, right, of course. Only in America. - Hush, hush! Now, just act normal, okay? - Hello. - Hi. - Hi. - Nice day for a picnic. - Very nice. (Liana sighs) What were you so worried about? (Liana giggles) - Alan, we'd better go. I'm still... - Yeah, I know. You're not finished with the divorce. - Yeah. I don't want today to end. - Neither do I. (peaceful orchestral music) - Wow. - And viola! (Liana laughs) - This is amazing! Where did you learn to cook like this? And don't say it's because you live in France. - But, it is. - Come on, where? - Actually, my wife was a Cordon Bleu chef. - Really, a woman Cordon Bleu? - Very rare, especially for a French woman. - She must have been very special. - [Alan] She was. - [Liana] I need to ask you something else. - About Catherine? - Mm-hm. - About how she died? - Am I prying? - No, no. - Oh, I shouldn't have asked. - No, it's okay. She died... She died three years ago in a fire. A gas line ruptured. Our whole apartment building burned down. - Oh, Alan, I'm so sorry. (Alan sighs) ("Nocturne No. 1 in B-flat Minor" by Frederic Chopin) - I was out buying a paper. And I was just, down the street. (sighs) It only took me a few seconds to get back, but I was already too late. The whole building was engulfed in flames. Can you imagine what it's like to be so close and yet... I was just a few feet away. - [Liana] Oh, Alan. - I shouldn't have told you this. - I'm glad you did. - Play something for me. - I can't. - Please. Something simple. From the heart.

(knocks) (door bell rings) - [George] Liana! - Oh, no. - [George] Liana, I need to see you. (knocks) Come on, Liana, open up. - George, not now, okay? I'll call you tomorrow. - [George] No, I need to talk to you now! - Can't it wait? - [George] It's important! (knocks) Come on, Liana! - You have no choice. - (chuckles) You're right, this could go on all night. (sighs) (knocks) - Liana! (knocks) I had to see you. - Well? - They want me to run again. - Who? - The election committee. They're talking about a whole new strategy this time. Back to traditional American values. Hard work. Integrity. Family. The things that matter. - Really? Congratulations. - Yeah, it's great. This could be a new beginning. For us. - George, I don't think so. - (chuckles) Come on, it could be like old times! A winning strategy, a cause to believe in. Working together. - Sure. Traditional values, family. A supportive wife. I understand. - This is my chance, Liana. Don't let me down. - George, don't play games with me. I'm not your wife anymore. - Yeah. That's for sure. Hey, we're still friends, aren't we? Aren't you gonna let me in? - No. - (chuckles) Why not? - Because she already has company. - Well, well, if it isn't Liberace. - Leave us alone, George. - What am I interrupting? A piano lesson? (chuckles) - George, please. - You just couldn't wait, could you? Even if it ruins me. - Don't do this. - Why don't you leave? Before somebody gets hurt. - Hurt? Before someone gets hurt? Oh, I think somebody is definitely going to get hurt. Au revoir, maestro. (dark orchestral music) - What does he want? Don't look at me. - Alright, let's start at the beginning. Why did you marry the man? - Well... When I first met him, George was... I don't know. Dynamic. He seemed to have this vision. He wanted to change the world. And I wanted to be part of that. It was exciting. And then he was elected to state senate and looked like we were on our way. I guess I was seduced a little by all the energy and the excitement of politics. And so was George. But with him, it became an obsession. After a while, all he cared about was winning. Not about helping people. And then two years ago, he wasn't re-elected. Since then, he hasn't cared about anything important. It's as if he's lost his soul. - Or stolen yours. - He wasn't mean at first, just disappointed. But now he's different, he's bitter and he's blaming me for everything. I don't know whether he loves me or he hates me. It's scary. He's been such a bastard. - I've noticed. (Liana sighs) Do you want me to stay a while? - I'd like that. Alan. I... - Shh, shh. (Liana sighs) My last concert in Los Angeles is tomorrow night. Be my guest? - Oh, with pleasure. (Alan chuckles) So, when are you leaving for San Francisco? - Early the next morning. - Oh. ("Sonata in F, 3rd Movement" by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) (audience applauds) (footsteps approach) ("Nocturne No. 1 in B-flat Minor" by Frederic Chopin) (peaceful orchestral music) - Why don't we go back to my hotel? (peaceful orchestral music) - [Liana] What time is it? - Three o'clock. - Is something wrong? - I've gotta go. I've got a five o'clock flight. - [Liana] I'll ride with you to the airport. (sighs) (thunder claps) (dark electronic music) (gasps) - Whore! - Let her go! (thuds) (George groans) - Damnit! Get in the car. Drive! (car starts) - Well, you've got a hairline fracture. Nothing to worry about, it'll heal fine, but we should put a cast on it. - For how long? - Six weeks. - Oh, Alan, your tour. - Can we have a minute alone? - Of course. - Thanks. (doctor chuckles) - Ow! - Oh, I'm-- - Honey, no. - No, stop, stop, what are you gonna do? - What can I do? I'll call my agent. His life will be hell for a couple of days. He'll finally have a chance to earn his commission. - What about all your fans? - We'll reschedule. Besides, I could use a little time off. - I've made such a mess of things. - [Alan] It's not your fault. - Yes, it is, I feel awful about this. - It's not bothering me at all. Hey. Maybe we could go somewhere together. - What? - Get out of the city. If it wasn't for George, we wouldn't have this opportunity to find out more about us. - (chuckles) Wait a minute. Are you sure about this? - Trust me. (energetic piano music) - (chuckles) Not today. (upbeat rock music) - (chuckles) Alright. Oh, look! - Oh, this is beautiful. (Liana sighs) - I think we're up here. - Up there? - [Liana] Yeah. Come on, I'll race ya. - (chuckles) I don't think so. - Why not? Oh, come on. It's great. (Alan chuckles) (gasps) "Dear Liana.

(Liana chuckles) - I don't know. Sometimes I've dreamed of having my own music school. - You can still do it. - Yeah. I love children. - You really are wonderful. (waves crash) Catherine. I've lost so much, Liana. - She was beautiful. - Like our son. - You have a son? - He's six now. He's in school, I never see him. I'm gone so much. The kid's growing up without me, and I feel like I'm losing him. - Oh, that's awful. - I couldn't tell you before, I don't know why. - How did he survive the fire? - He was with me buying the paper. - What's he like? (Alan chuckles) - He's a boy, he's a handful. (melancholic string music) I'm not holding the torch for her. I know she's gone. - I did notice you took your ring off. - Yeah. Liana, this is part of who I am. Every time I see Robert, it reminds me of Catherine. Which is maybe why I don't see him that often. - You've gotta spend more time with your son, Alan. - I know. - Come on, let's go to bed. (waves crash) - Yeah, I'll be back soon, Robert (speaks French) I miss you a lot. What? (speaks French) I'm bringing you a present. (speaks French) Take care. (speaks French) - How was he? - He misses me. But he's okay. - Good. Come on. ("Piano Sonata No. 11" by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) (Alan claps) I did it. (Alan chuckles) - Okay? - Okay. Well? Aren't you coming? - Yeah. Yeah, I'll catch up. - What are you doing? - Never mind, just go ahead, I'll catch up. Shoo, go. - Shoo? (chuckles) Okay. (Alan hums melodically) (Alan whistles melodically) (melancholic orchestral music) (ominous tones) (water splashes) We need to talk. - I'm happy you're playing again. - It's like I have a part of my life back. - I knew you could do it. - Yeah. (chuckles) - You haven't lost your touch. Not in here. - I know. - But we're not really talking about what you wanna talk about, are we? - No. - No. - Catherine and Robert are part of who you are. - Yes. - The question is, am I okay with that? - Are you? - I don't know. I wonder if I'll ever measure up to your memory of Catherine. - That's what she's become, Liana, a memory. You helped me realize that. You are my here and now. - What about Robert? - He'll love you as much as I do. - Look. - It's lovely. - [Liana] I've been so happy being here with you. But does anything ever last? - I don't know. Nothing is ever perfect. It's like playing Mozart. You never get it exactly right. But if you're willing and practice, it gets better and better.

(ominous music) - George, what are you doing here? - Enough is enough. - My business is with Liana. - How did you know we were here? - You left the address on your phone pad. - You broke into my house? - It's not your house yet. - Let it go, George! - I want you back. - It's too late for that. - I want you back! - No! - It's too late! - Well, if I can't have you... Nobody will! - What are we gonna do? - Call the police? - I can't. - He's obviously crazy. - I know, but... - I think we'd better get back. (suspenseful music) Dearest Liana.
