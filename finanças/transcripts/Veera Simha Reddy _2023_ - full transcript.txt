You said something like Jai....Who’s that? Who’s that? - He is the one. I love him. It’s nice.. wow. Another thing… I decided to marry him only. Is it? Ask you parents to come and talk. Okay? Okay...I will tell mother. What is it? Isha’s father agreed to our marriage it seems. He asked my parents to come and talk. Sad she doesn’t know that I don’t have a father. Jai! Well, if there’s a question you never asked and I never answered. It’s high time I revealed that. Your dad is alive. There are wild animals in a forest. They survive by hunting. This forest has a king... who controls the wild animals and rules it. That name is lion. If it has a heart... if the lion is a human being... that’s your father. Your dad is courage personified in the house of fear. His name sends shivers down the spines of even hunting sickles. Everyone is born to live on earth. But your father is born as a lion to let the earth live... He now lives in Rayalaseema. He is the very incarnation of Lord Kadiri Narasimha who is living for the well-being of Seema region. Name is... Veerasimha Reddy. Mr.Reddy...Your heart is like Vedic Chants Both seek well-being of the world. This ritual will surely yield good results. As it is conceived with good intentions. 30 villages... 300 couple marriages. All under the aegis of the Patriarch. Looking like a festival. Greetings Yes...Khadar brother.. How are you? I am good sir. God willing -Thank you. Is everyone good? -We are good sir... Young couples, please sit down. A hand without marriage line. I shouldn't touch the holy thread... you carry on. What are you saying? As if all married people deserve to bless sir. This is the hand that performed countless marriages. If you don’t touch, then they are not holy threads. Not that, Siddhappa... Sir... Ram was God, even when Sita was away. You don’t need any qualification than a pure heart.. Please don’t say no sir. Wish you a wonderful married life. [chants] Siddhappa... Sir... I see some people have optimism about future. In others, I see hostility towards me. Hey... Hey! All those who came to tie the knot, sit there. Those who came to sever my head, stand up. Hey... The butcher who cuts the hen knows no anger I am also like that. I kill responsibly In a manner that they shudder to get reborn again. But this this not the right time or place… You’ve come for the wedding… Have food and leave. Getting scared? Are you afraid of those who come to kill you? Are you scared that I will chop your head off in front of your own recruits? Fear has no place in my biodata, you fool Not just them... Get hordes of people.. Till the last head is cut off... I won’t leave the sword... won’t change hands also I will slaughter them with a single hand... This is a place for bonding… not for heads to roll. No! To kill you itself is auspicious. Right now... here... I will show you death. Even death has to take my appointment to meet me. But if you come without appointment, then forget the occasion or location. I Will chop your head off just go.. Hey...Come on, everyone. Hey! Hey! Sir... Hey....go and tell your wife, you ….? that Veerasimha Reddy has sent home auspicious stuff for her (left me alive). Leave... I will come. He left in the morning without eating... He will return hungry. It’s head curry... I should feed his tummy full. Hey...why are you making it so chilly? Need as much, sister. Hey...Suramma...mix the bones well... It should cook well Look...he has come. Why are your clothes dirty? Wash your feet... Take this. I got the minister’s post after much hassle. You are making me sign everywhere. If something happens tomorrow then I will be in a soup. Even if you hide in a neighbourhood state, he will come and thrash you. Finger Millet ball....get it. Uncle...you also come. You have it...I have work -Okay. Chicken Head curry... I have prepared for you. Jackfruit curry... eat. Aren’t you ashamed. I have asked for his head... you are having head curry. At least let me eat food peacefully. More than enemy’s death eating food has become important for you. Started. Every time going to Pulicharla like visiting a pilgrimage. Losing in the hands of Veera Simha reddy. You are waiting for his blood stains to be on the sword since 30 years. living the life taking yellow saffron given by the enemy... it doesn’t sound like old aged women. its more like being a widow. Those bangles look odd on me... I will remove them. You wear it.. Hey...what? He made me cut my father’s head. Why will I leave his head? revenge is not just for you...even for me. Even an enemy should’nt have a wife like her. Even my opposition should go through hardships like my nephew Saireddy True sir. Where is that lady who refused to sleep with husband just because he couldn’t avenge her insults? We are witnessing it sir. My dear...I am as much eager to see him dead as you. Don’t call me as Pratap reddy if I don’t anoint his blood stain on your saree. Will you stick to your promise now at least...? I will... listen to me. Is that so. Demon’s love. Son-in-law... First watch his strengths if we gotta hit Veerasimha Reddy. His strength is the people behind him. I have a plan to hit his people. What is it...? Tell him the Big Man said it’s not possible... understood? Want to meet him… Hello Reddy sir… Yes…Mr Rajagopal …Greetings Please sit down. Are our people fine? Mr Reddy Sir… 25 years ago, you beckoned me to set up this factory to improve the conditions in Seema area. You arranged for land allotment to the factory. You gave a job to every household. You fought with the government for 4 cusecs of additional supply of water to the nearby villages and fields, which helped irrigate lands in neighbourhoods. But now…? But now…? Governments changed. Situation changed. Addabakula Peddi reddy became a minister from here. That’s it. since then situation is unlike before Reddy sir. They wanted 60% share in profits in order to maintain status quo, else they want us to sell the factory to them. They are threatening workers not to come to the factory. Even the power supply is cut. Now they want to choke off the life-blood of the canal water supply from the factory by setting up another factory. They are even getting foreign investors... for the ground-breaking ceremony of the factory, Reddy Sir. Ground-breaking ceremony? Who are coming? All political leaders from the district, Reddy Sir. I will come alone. Will it happen at least now? This time we won’t miss, uncle. We will lay foundation stone on his body. Hello, Minister is on his way... get the garlands ready. Siddhappa! Sir... Assassins from Kurnool, Silent invaders from Chittoor... Assaulters from Kadapa... and Sword-soldiers from Anantpur… will all storm you. By noon, let’s chop them all and spread their bodies as manure. Son-in-law... What the hell is this? Looks like milestone got its moustache. Stop, stop, I am telling you to stop. Look, you stop. Hey... go back... go.... Go back... come on go back... go back... he is coming. If you do good deeds, I bow to you. If you try to harm them, I won’t spare anyone.. I will dump your body parts in Tungabhadra river. Both my word and sword are sharp. He knows it well. If I start slaying, even your wives cannot identify your body parts. Let’s go...go now... Who is he to decide what to do or not here? Is the centre backing him? Or, the opposition? Sir..whoever it is, his family can alter political scenarios. They are not dependent on politicians sir. Is he that capable? Yes sir. He is a force that even the wind will not move against him. He has a crazy following in Seema area, sir. Honourable Home Minister Sir… Only you can stop him. Even though we are State Ministers, his word is law of the land. We can’t face him. I beg you. Do something sir. SP... -Sir... Arrange a meeting with Veerasimha Reddy. Okay, sir Minister is calling you for the meeting sir. He is an idiot. Why should you go, Sir? They are idiots elected by people. We should respect them. I am going....you leave. -Yes sir. What is this uncle? Why are you meeting someone you bury? What do we bury? you silly. It is not enough to carry sickles... you should have some sense in your minds too. Now that he has meddled with the government, see how Veerasimha reddy will shiver in front of the Home Minister. What is the matter SP? Is Veerasimha reddy coming or not? He has reached sir. We are in power... -Congratulations I am the home minister. Glad to meet you. Who are you to decide what is to be done here? I don’t talk about what I do.. I just implement the GO fully. G.O.? Your G.O. is government order. My G.O. is God’s order. If you come in the way of development, government won’t keep quiet. Which development? Prosperity What is development, Mr. Home Minister? Progress means development. It's not about harassing people. Paying salaries is development, not giving doles. To work is development, not to stop work. To build is development, not to demolish. Getting new industries is development, not about closing existing ones. Come to senses. Know the real meaning of development. Then why are you stopping new industries? They have come to loot... Not allowed. If I call, the entire state police will be here. They won’t come...I won’t allow. Not allowed. I will come against you By-election is expensive for people. Not allowed. What makes you so arrogant? You may be arrogant due to your position.. By birth, arrogance is in my DNA. Rayalaseema lags because of this impropriety. Hold your tongue! I don’t cut the body part that wrongs me. But if you utter wrong, I will cut your throat. Rayalaseema gave India a President. Rayalaseema sent 6 chief ministers to the erstwhile undivided Andhra Pradesh. Rayalaseema gave the man who raise his fist to fight for the self-respect of the Telugus. Rayalaseema gave a Visionary who brought world-wide attention to AP. This is Rayalaseema... “Royal” Seema. When dogs bark on the path trodden by the elephant king, look at the king. Not the dogs Veerasimha Reddy! I grew up with the salt water of this Seema This blood flows in us too. We also have the same rights and endowments here. Minister... I respected your position. I came as soon as you called... I don’t need to hear anyone else. Hey...If we wish, you can’t get out of here. Oh is it...then wish. Wish... Not every hair that sprouts on the mouth is a moustache, kid. It has a certain pedigree. Stand up only if you have the gumption. Sit down... Reddy... -Remember... Your death is in my hands. Hey...don’t challenge... I will hurl corpses. Minister... do good to the people... they will venerate you... else, they will crush you. Why are you silent when he is talking like that? When you are driving in your car, if a deer crosses you, you can honk the horn. But if it’s a lion there... better to shut down everything including the engine. It’s now the lion that came. This time, let’s hit them not with our weapons. But with the guns of our police. Sir, of late, if law & order is controlled by the politicians, politics is reined in by Law. The police will listen, if he instructs. Veerasimhareddy is going to Bengaluru to attend Shiva Reddy’s daughter’s marriage in a week. Got it SP? Just encounter him by arranging some sharp shooters, sir. Whose marriage? It’s that of Shiva Reddy’s daughter. Siddhappa...Shall we start? We can’t trust Gangi Reddy’s son. So, I stepped up the security as we are going to Bengaluru.. I am the security for myself. I am leaving Chinnamma. Okay. Why is this phone ringing now..? Hello... Hello... Veera... Veera... Veera... Meenakshi! You have to come to Turkey I am starting now. Don’t you ask why? A person who can’t answer has no right to question. I have an answer. I will wait for you. I am coming. We have to go to Turkey, Siddhappa. Meenakshi! Are you fine? I am good. How are you? Jai! My memories have lived with you for 25 years. I live here in your memory. Veera... He is the one I birthed in your remembrance... "Isn’t this what an unprecedented conjunction is!" "Isn’t this what an inexhaustible bank of memories is!" "Here are two parakeets, Serenading in the garden of smiles!" " Conversing with each other, In a song consumed with passion!" "Their hearts are one, Combined from each other!" "Isn’t this what an inexhaustible bank of memories is!" Meenakshi... didn’t you know then that you were bearing my future? Why didn’t you tell? Your decision cannot be altered. Even the one about the baby. Did he never ask where his dad is? I never made him feel the need to ask. Society will ask right? I don’t need to answer them. I carry the burdens of the village. You are carrying mine too. How can I repay your debt? I can't live with you, but I'm living for you. You're my life. Will my life be indebted to me? By the way..Why did you ask me to come urgently? Greetings... -Greetings... Please come. Before talking about alliance, You should know a truth. We are parents to my son... but not really a wedded couple. If marriage means tying the holy knot... we didn’t get married. But if marriage means walking the path and abiding by the holy vows... then we are a couple Even if there’s no stage set…for vows not uttered… we abided by them all our lives Even if separated by the seas... we were mentally united. Meenakshi! she coped with my loneliness as well as my responsibility. She raised my son to reach levels of my stature... now tell me… Do you like an alliance with us? You sound like a human embodiment of rich culture sir. What else do we want but an alliance with you? What about auspicious time? Get married right now, dear...no problem When we met we didn’t know… we were living apart At least, let the children marry at an auspicious time. Sure sir. See you. Yes Daddy. Mother, I am so happy. Come let’s go. I invested 500 crores trusting you guys. And you run away from him when he is chopping men…you shameless fellows Bloody good for nothing. Hey...business... Will call you in 10 days after killing him... Leave. 10 days... Hello... Hey, Pratap reddy...Is our work done? Did you kill Veerasima reddy...? Not yet. -10 days... In 10 days, you said you will kill and call me right... what the hell has happened now? He is going to Bengaluru to attend a wedding. I drew a sketch to kill him there. I will call you after killing him. Bullshit! What will you kill, my foot! He is right here in Istanbul. He came to my home. He sat in front of me. He crossed his legs, had coffee and had the audacity to ask my daughter in marriage for his son. Is it? I am alive today because he didn’t see me the other day. If you want to do anything and if you still believe you are manly, then show your guts here. Show it in Istanbul. What happened? He is in Turkey. He has a wife. He has a son too. He screwed up my life and is living happily there. God gives a chance to everyone to rule for a day... my turn has come. Bring your son along with you sir. Let the entire Rayalaseema reverberate in excitement with a grand wedding. No Siddhappa. our path is different, his world is different. I will only come after blessing him. Is that so. Yes. You sheared four sheep and feeding us. What is the matter? For the first time, Veerasimha reddy crossed the Seema border, away from his land and people. We won’t get such an opportunity again. Let us join hands... let’s kill him. First strike is mine. Ours too... we swore on the food. Uncle, sharpen the axes going for hunting... Why do you need an axe? Let’s just shoot him down silently with the guns... account will be settled. A murder in Seema means our dagger should be burrowed in his heart. our hands should be smeared with his blood... that is what murder means. Uncle... call Jayaram... Tell him to oversee everything from taking care of our people to finishing him off. This time... -Alright In Istanbul...is crime impossible? Every crime has a price, officer. Yes...Siddhappa. Since they can’t win against you in a face-off, they want to back-stab you. They are searching for you in Turkey after knowing you are here it seems I got bored with killing men at old places. Let them come... Let the white people see how a Telugu man kills. Jai... Heard Mall of Istanbul is very famous here. Tomorrow is engagement right... Go take the girl out for shopping. Why don’t you also join us? I have some work dear. Meenakshi...stay with them and give what they want. Okay thanks... Shall we go? Hey Siddha...Strike him on his leg. Even in an alien country, you are simmering with so much revenge means... you shouldn’t be killed normally. come...come... come... Come... Hey... Veerasimha Reddy Hey, Pratap reddy. I was searching for the place of your death. Finally, it’s here.... Come...come If anything happens to her... I have forgiven you many times till now... This time even God can’t save you. Then who will save her. Brother... Brother... I have called you brother, keeping aside, 30 years of revenge. still you want to kill my husband. No dear...this fellow. You are there to protect every girl in Seema. But you want to widow your own sister, brother? Protect your sister’s husband, brother. Jai! Sister... Who is your sister? Who is my brother? Uncle! Jai! Sit down. She is my sister. My sister called me brother. My life is insignificant compared with that salutation. This body belongs to Seema... and it should be cremated here only. You will take me there, right? Hey, Jai... take care of my sister. I slayed him dad... I crossed the seas to kill the fellow who sacrificed you at the altar of Seema... After living in dread for years... your soul can now rest in peace after Veerasimha Reddy is killed, dad I slayed that Veerasimhareddy. The Seema belongs to us. "Open your eyes once And see, big brother!" "All the folks who keep faith in you are trembling, sire!" "Is it true or what, that the peaks are razed to the ground?" "And the tears snowball into waterfalls! The heartbeat stopped." "It’s like an ascent to heaven, the life journey you undertook." "Inconsolable, the hearts that broke down, from amongst your kindred brethren." "A sensation you were on this planet!" "A movement without any impurities!" "An expedition that is deathless!" "How can we forget you for even a moment!" "Farewell to you, dear Big Brother! It’s time to bid adieu!" "The deep blue skies are awaiting your return." "We shall not see another leader this way, now or hereafter!" "Peace to All! Peace to All! Peace to All! Peace to All!" "Peace to All! Peace to All! Peace to All! Peace to All!" My father became God to this Seema land. But an enemy to his own sister. What happened? Veerasimha Reddy is not just a name… It is courage personified in Seema. Till date, no weapon that can harm was born. But a bond got created… as your aunt It's a story even your mother didn’t tell. The story begins with a mother's labour pains. Your father knew the truth when as a child he couldn’t distinguish an illicit relationship from a normal one. Because of your grandfather’s mistake, a mother delivered and died. Your dad became a brother to a sister. He made sure sister lit the funeral pyre of your dad and the village accept the relationship. He became a father to her after grandfather’s passing. Veerasimha Reddy’s heart became bigger as he aged. He became a God and a saviour of Pulicharla village. But in the nearby village, Musalimadugu, people suffered under a demon Pratap Reddy’s father Gangi Reddy, He tasted blood like a crocodile. He only knows to kill those who turn against him. Everywhere you could only find corpses in Musalimadugu village. But a young boy changed all that. -Uncle has come. That boy's maternal uncle came to Musalimadugu one day Even the temple doors are bolted to prevent God from listen to their pleas. Why should we stay here in fear. Let’s go to our village. Veerasimha Reddy is as good as God. Hey...for decades, we have been living here, we will die here only. After my death, you can take your sister to your village. Brother, what happened? I’ve lost my appetite, mom I will leave... I am leaving... Be careful, brother. Who is she? She is Veeranna’s wife… Have you fallen for her…? Bring her along with you. I am like your daughter...please leave me sir. Why talk about relations on bed? Hey...come out. Hey Pratap...what is that noise? Her husband, dad. Looks like he wants to see his wife enjoying. Drag him inside. Mom! wake up. Dad! wake up. Mom! wake up. Mom! wake up... Mom! wake up. Veerasimha Reddy! Hey, who are you? It seems that Veerasimha reddy is God. I will give him my village…ask him to accept. As per traditions, you should only start first Temple is waiting for you, sir. so what? It is God’s work...please don’t deny it sir. You are saying it is God’s work... Ask that God to come. Hey...Gangi reddy He is coming, you... scoundrel. God is here to awaken the villagers to become courageous. Lord Narasimha Swamy has come to pull your intestines out and drink your blood. I'm inviting you to come, slapping thighs. Today, if your head is not severed, I will take off my clothes and roam around the entire village of Musalimadugu. Hey... who has guts to corner me in my own den? Which God has he invited? Who is he...? It’s me.. Veerasimha Reddy! Born in Pulicharla, studied in Anantapur and ruling Kurnool. You come to my village to die? Village is neither yours or mine.. It belongs to the future. The future generations awaits your death and rang my door. I promised them to cut your head and change the fortune of the village. This is not as easy as the head of a sheep or a goat to chop It is Gangi Reddy’s head. Even the knife shudders to touch me. Hey...the knife may shudder to touch you but the entire Seema shivers if I enter. Hey... He is God, it seems... tie him down. Am I a sheep or a goat to tie down? I am a lion. Siddhappa! Hey...First kill the future generation. Throw him father Sir! Father! Hey...I give 3 options to anyone who confronts me. Either he should reform, or run away, or perish. Your father took the first option. Now only two options are left... reform yourself or leave the Seema. leave. "Royalty, thy surname! Manliness your body language!"

Get lost, old woman. She has to go to the in-laws house one day... don’t pamper her so much Grandma… She lost her mother during birth Lost her father before she realised. She shouldn’t lose any more in life. I will give her anything. either winning or my life. Get her a good husband… what else does a girl want Like that grandma...Be on that job, brother. After my father’s death, I asked at every household in the Seema. No one came forward to help us in killing Veerasimha Reddy… Will you help me? Hey...I am your mother’s brother. Isn’t your revenge mine? Hey…why doesn’t your college open There’s still time for it father... Mother is inside, right? Yes...go. Please come home to see my sister. What is there to see once it is is Veerasimha Reddy’s sister…? Oh no...Why did he come now? What will he say now. Who is he? My brother-in-law. We will take leave... -Okay. See you. About other things.. It is not about other things... We need to talk about a very important thing. See brother-in-law... Isn’t she the daughter of your dad’s illicit relationship? Just because she is your step sister, I hope you guys won’t cut corners with marriage gifts? Bhanumati is my sister… Same blood flows in us. She maybe born to another mother. That doesn't mean she isn’t mine. Don’t I know how much you love Bhanumati? Just because he said something, don’t take it seriously. Pain is felt by the one who bears it. Your smile is so mesmerising, dear. Smile. Smile... Please "Enkamma Aunty, Yellamma Aunty, Pullamma Aunty, Mallamma Aunty" "How can I hide my fatigue!" "New for him, new for me.." Looks like there is a fair near by.. let us go. "started all after three nights, the usual silly storms of temper!" Oh dear! What happened? "He loves Churidar, What with the Summer heat!" "Whereas, draped in white saree, decked in jasmine flowers.." "as soon as I stepped so, he became grumpy" "The Dude’s sentiments hurt it seems!" "The Dude’s sentiments hurt it seems!"

Hello C.I sir.. -Hello, Reddy sir.. Why these faction wars when you are around? Hey.. doing a settlement meeting? Think you became manly or what? Siddhappa! Sir! Why did I educate you? So that at least your generation will change, isn’t it? You made us study, Sir.. But how to live? There are no jobs in this Seema.. No water in the fields. That is why we went with Subba Reddy for a land settlement deal. Our mistake sir.. Please forgive us. I am providing education to this generation so that no household gets blood stains again. But they are migrating due to lack of jobs The rest who doesn’t get education are taking a wrong path I have convinced my friend in Delhi to set up a factory here. Reddy sir…you have 100 acres of land near the canal... which is the right place to set up the factory If you agree to give, then as a trade-in I will give my 200 acres to you. That is good. Bartering lands is also good business. Not as a business... Give it as an alliance I want to send my sister to your house as daughter-in-law. Sorry. Sekhar... Why suddenly giving excuses? come here Isn’t it a mistake to come in the way of Chinnamma? Those who wanted to live together.. Won’t come in the way... They accompany us. We thought about it but..It won’t happen Bhanu. What happened..? Your brother gave a word to Rambhupalreddy that you would be his daughter-in-law. What is it you want to tell me? Tell -You tell.. Why are you thinking much to tell me dear? I am in love with someone. Who is he? Hey.. Siddhappa... Sir! he is... Hey..come here Is it true what my sister said? Is it true? You get married to him. Nothing is more dear to me than you, my sister. How can I say no to your likes? I worried how and where you will all live. Now, I am happy that both of you will stay with me. Sekhar... Sir... I am entrusting my care and my life to you. take care. Sure sir. You grew up together. Now live together.. -No sir our strata are different. We should be where we belong to. True. One should live life with whoever is in the heart. Siddhappa… we are not different. You are the protector of my life. You protect me from clashes. You are the foundation of my status. I am ever indebted to you. Let me give my sister to your family. What else needed? Tomorrow is the engagement... marriage, thereafter. Hey girl... in 4 days, Vijayadasami festival... Then hunting ritual and 10 days later, marriage... don’t rush. I didn't keep my word for the first time. Excuse me. The land you asked is not for power and pelf right? It is for the welfare of Seema. I won't be a human if I take back the land meant for a good purpose. Your intent is very noble Veerasimha Reddy. This should happen. Here..take the property (land) papers My promise to the village… got broken because of my sister My word helped connect the village with. I am happy that our bonding became stronger now with this marriage. For generations, this hunting ritual reflects the Seema culture… It’s not just a game The hunting ritual is between our target and aggression. It is the ritual which unites the revenge of the hunters. There you go…sheep that sheep running around Whoever shot that sheep with gun is declared as a winner. For the last 6 years, Veerasimha Reddy wins the hunting game. Brother, Our guys are attacking Veerasimha Reddy. Hey...how long should we wait.. Will your Veerasimha Reddy come or not..? Without any competition declare that Pratapreddy has won. Declare... -Hey... Hey is that you...? Talk nicely Pratapreddy. First your head will be chopped off instead of goat, if Veerasimha reddy enters. Hey, you were living off him all these years. And now you have the audacity to marrying his sister. ask him to enter the fray and show his manliness. Lets go. Veera! I won! Grandma... -Grandma... There’s no doubt Sir. It is Pratap Reddy who behind this attack. Grandma... Let us behead him..come lets go. Siddhappa wait. Let's go to hospital first. It is not so easy to kill a sheep like you found his sister. Hey...first learn to be a man in this land. Hey, finally Veerasimha Reddy after all the search picked a sissy as his son-in-law. Can’t I hit a sheep? Can’t I hit a sheep when I could easily trap a girl How dare you say that I am not a man in front of the village people, you scoundrel. Should I prove it... Hey... Pratap Reddy Oh no! Suri... Suri... Suri... What happend Suri? Suri... Suri... Oh God! Suri... Sir! please forgive him. He is about to get married. He is just like my son. Forgive him and spare him, sir. Spare him sir. Sir.. Spare him, Spare him, Spare him. It was just an act of oversight, as they are saying, right? Knowingly or unknowingly, a person died. Your irresponsibility has cost a family dearly. You've killed my trust. Hey... From now on you will live in the village only, not with them. as good as a corpse. That corpse will turn into ashes in few moments. But this corpse will live on until it turns into ashes. Sekhar... Sekhar... Sekhar... Sekhar... Mother has come to see you. Remove your hand. Because of you... You have killed my Sekhar. You tried to stop our marriage and made him kill himself. You made him kill himself. I didn’t understand what good you meant when you assured Siddhappa. This is what you meant by good. You were faking it. Your affections for me is fake... I figured out who you are now. you are so smart Because I wasn’t born to your mother right. Veerasimha Reddy! You wanted to start a factory in the village and become good in public eye and barter me in a deal which didn’t work. You couldn’t digest my marriage with your slave’s son. You pretended to accept our love You waited for an opportunity. Now you got the opportunity and used it well. Bhanu, dear..Do you know what you are talking about? I am talking to the one who killed your son. He is not my brother and not even a human being. That day the mother of the killed person asked him to leave your son. He didn’t. At that moment, the entire village sympathised with me... except you. Veerasimha Reddy I took you as my father, not just a brother. I never saw my mother, but I saw her in you. You killed... You killed the sister in me made my see my lover die. Now I will see the death of the one who faked love. I will see your death. He is coming. It won’t be nice if you ask brother-in-law.. I will tell him...you leave now. I will tell him myself that I am pregnant. Leave... Meenakshi! I have to talk to you. Brother-in-law... I became an enemy to my sister, Meenakshi. My sister first saw me only when she opened her eyes to the world. I never wanted to see tears in her eyes but now I became a reason for it. Meenakshi... Will you cooperate with me? Just like the vacuum in my sister’s life, there should be a vacuum of happiness in my life too. Since I killed the love of her life... I don’t deserve love too I want self-punish myself and have come for your permission Even if we didn’t marry, you are my wife. You are only my wife. Will you give permission to live far apart from me because I don’t have place for love and marriage, Meenakshi? Brother-in-law... We were married at the moment I loved you. I share your grief.. I shall live apart. See you. You don’t know, dear.. but you will always be with me wherever I live. You are inside me. Your mother hid the truth from Veerasimha Reddy that she was pregnant. But your aunt... She did something that the village never expected. She married an enemy who prayed for your father’s death. I want Veerasimha Reddy to die. As long as I carry this thread around my neck, his axe won’t touch your neck. Tie the knot... You will understand. Look what she’s done! Look what she’s done! You have sacrificed love and marriage for your sister. Never imagined that she will do this. What? Have you come for the first night.. Kill him and come. I have married you not for family life... but for taking revenge. I will declare you as a man on the day you kill Veerasimha Reddy. Till then you are just a husband. Go… Kill him and come with his blood. Only then I will share the bed with you. Hey! I will go right now and kill him and prove my manliness to you. Hey..Veerasimha Reddy Come out. Kill him Sir. His head should roll in Musalimadugu. Hey! Hey you fool... You became a relation after marrying my sister. You are alive not because of your masculinity. but because of my sister’s holy thread. Go... Go and tell my sister... that I have sent turmeric and red powder. Leave. Veerasimhareddy is not an ordinary person. He gave life to the one who came for his death. He is living alone denying himself pleasure and happiness. He is like Lord Narasimha Swamy Himself wearing black clothes. Your father keeps sending your aunt, turmeric and red powder. But she keeps trying to usher in your father’s death. Everytime he killed the death sent by sister... but didn’t extinguish the love for her. So much love on her. She killed the love...She killed it. Veerasimha Reddy lived for Seema... but died for his sister. He’s gone. That Veerasimha Reddy's son has come right... do we kill him in the village? After 30 years, I am having a peaceful meal… Is it necessary now? He is a kid, uncle.. -It seems. Hey...you go and look after the factory work Uncle.. you fix an auspicious time for my big night. I took up the sword so that nobody else picks up a sword in the Seema. Not for lording over or influence. It’s my calling. A duty bequeathed to me by future generations. Leadership is my legacy. It’s not faction…but affection for Seema. Jai! I really can’t believe it I can’t believe that there are men as Godly as your dad... And amongst women, as diabolical as Bhanumati. I really can’t believe it. Sir! In the Seema, the smell of blood is in the air always. Since you are not used to this... you can’t stay here. You shouldn’t stay too. You came here to discharge your duty as a son. You fulfilled it. You can leave after the last day function. Take your mother and leave. Here are the tickets… Veerasimha Reddy is a God. Your father stood like a rock by every person in this area. He gave me confidence to set up factory here. Now that confidence is gone along with his passing. I lack the stamina to stand against Pratap Reddy. I am relinquishing the factory to them. My association with this Seema is over. Please sir... don't sign the documents I beg you sir... please don't sign. Sir, please don't sign the documents. Hey Rajgopal. Sign it.. Let’s finish this. If you sign, the name on the board may change. But not the name of the person who created history. No one can change it. That is my father. It is Veerasimha Reddy’s dream. My dad’s dream. Whoever obstructs that dream, I will cut the heads and float more bodies. Hey..You think you are a man if you bash 10 people? You don’t talk about masculinity... Even masculinity will feel ashamed. He is called a man who protects women. The one who hides behind a woman is called an eunuch. You... widower Hey.. I didn’t count the number of stabs on your father. But with you, I will count and kill.. Come on you... Come.. By default, if you are born as man.. By mistake, if you are a man... If you are born to Seema’s manhood. Let my aunt say just one word... That she doesn’t have any relationship with him. Can she say? Scoundrel! Hey... Your death is guaranteed in my hands also. Call your relatives... Gather your men. Size up your strengths. Wherever, in the 8 districts of Rayalaseema. Anytime.. Ready... Entire country will tell tales about I slay you. This is Jayasimha Reddy... S/o. Veerasimha Reddy It's a challenge! When swallows like Jay show their valour as infused by Veera Simhareddy, he is still alive... This region sees itself in you. From today, this Seema is yours, sir. God of mass has come. Even villains are not spared.. Whistle moment for fans. "What, Reddy? What, Reddy? Everywhere buzz about you!" "Slapping thighs, scaring folks, your name echoing all over!" "From where this relentless drive comes to pulverize people!" "No man tall or brawny can combat with you as equal!" "By birth, this is all in the DNA from dad’s genes" "Same to Same, it is his cutout that’s become my reference." "Your dynamism and your energy is over-powering!" "Your cadence and your swing are stirring me!" "Mass husband is here, Mass husband is here," "Getting smitten seeing the apertures in blouse!" "Mass husband is here, Mass husband is here," "Planted mouth-to-mouth kisses and brushing with moustache!" "Like a fabled, colour-winged Unicorn, You are springing forth, dear girl!" "Holding reins made of jasmine flowers, Take charge of my life, good and bad, Darling!" "Your razor-sharp looks plucked all my inhibitions Like a lion draped in silk lungi," "All my gait and demeanor right upto the last mole Are all swaying your way, thanks to you!" "Your jauntiness is as cool as Kulu Manali, Spewing out fumes of passion in broad daylight" "Until the flower petals dance in raptures, The disquiet not going away soon!" "Your fluency and stamina make my cheeks blush" "So, match the tempo on my play and make it a frenzied night!" "Mass husband is here, Mass husband is here," "Getting smitten seeing the apertures in blouse!" "Mass husband is here, Mass husband is here," "Planted mouth-to-mouth kisses and brushing with moustache!" Why drink so much if factory doesn’t happen..? There’s plenty to grab yet. Hey... Do you think I am a eunuch? Did I take shelter behind you to axe Veerasimha Reddy? You... Pratap Reddy... What...Am I hiding behind your saree? Revenge is mine. Revenge is not just yours, it's mine too. Where did you feel any revenge? I am the reason for your revenge. Do you know how? I have met Sekhar after being humiliated in front of everybody. I asked him to shake hands to kill Veerasimha Reddy. Hey...This life is for Veerasimhareddy. Whether he hits us or gives us, he is God. I killed him there, as my revenge went waste. I made the village believe that he committed suicide. I didn’t expect you will boil with revenge after his death.. but it happened. I used your love and affection for your brother to kill him.. I am not taking shelter behind your nuptial knot. In fact, I tied the knot with you to make you a watchdog in front of this house. Every step you take is because of my sketch. Veera... Jayasimha Reddy. Jayasimha Reddy. Did you deliver my brother again even before I wanted to kill him, Meenakshi..? Veerasimha Reddy is born again. He set foot on the Seema again is what the masses are saying… True... you are just like my brother. Are you doing fine, aunt..? You people are really great. You still shower love on me though I have killed your God. That… That is truly my brother’s royal blood. I mistook my brother’s love for step-brotherly love on me. I thought he killed my love. But... Instead, unbeknownst, I was living with the man who killed my love all these years. Any brother, if asked, will give away assets or stand by as a protector. My brother laid down his life for me. I never realised how much he loved me. Even when I gave him hell every second… he saw me with warmth in his dying moments. There is no one like my brother. There shouldn’t be any sister like me. Aunt! -Bhanu! Siddhappa.. Even after losing own son you trusted and lived with him. But even though born with the same blood, I took sides with the demon and killed my brother with these hands. No dear. Bhanu... No dear. No dear. You finally realised your mistake. This house is yours. Come in. Hey! Why do you call a sinner who killed God inside a temple, Meenakshi? I shouldn’t step inside. There’s no God here to forgive me. Jayasimha Reddy... For all these years I married Pratap Reddy and protected him from my brother. I stood like a barrier between his life and my brother’s axe. Now I am removing the barrier. I am going to the man who must forgive me. Bhanu! -Bhanu how come you did this dear. [chanting] Immerse it in holy rivers for her peace. This shouldn’t be immersed in river.. With my father.. My father loved her sister so dearly. He lived apart from her in life. At least, let his soul be with his after life. Hey Jayasimha Reddy.. You said I was hiding behind a woman. And she become an ash in your hands. If you are a man, come... My only guilt was that I couldn’t anoint the Seema with your father’s blood but now I will do with your blood... come. Hey.. I take an oath on my father’s tombstone while holding my aunt’s ashes. Before a drop of blood touches this land, I will chop off your head... If I don’t, then I am a son of of this Seema soil. come.. Hey! Siddhappa! I will snatch his life and immerse ashes. I will not kill you with one stab.. I will cut you to pieces.. come Take care of my sister. I am removing the barrier between his life and my brother’s axe. Is anyone else left? "Hail Balayya! Hail Balayya!" "Hail Balayya! Hail Balayya!" "Hail Balayya! Hail Balayya!" "So long as you stand by us, that’s enough sir!" "Hail Balayya! Hail Balayya!" "Hail Balayya! Hail Balayya!" "Hail Balayya! Hail Balayya!" "So long as you stand by us, that’s enough sir!" "Royalty, thy surname! Manliness your body language!" "Those who think of you, get up and pay obeisance to you!"
