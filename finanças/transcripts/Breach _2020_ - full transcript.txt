Subtitles by explosiveskull For a century, they vowed to cure the planet of the famine ravaging our world. While they made their bold promises in public, in secret, they planned their escape. And so today, after years of unrest, society has reached its breaking point as the last shuttle departs for New Earth, damning 19 billion people to extinction. We stick to the plan. Hey! Hey! Hey, watch it! Departure for New Earth to commence in T-minus three minutes. Positive. Take him in. - Have your papers ready. - Move. Move. Stowaways will be executed on sight. No unauthorized personnel allowed. - Hayley! - Noah! Noah! - Hayley! - Hey! Hey! - Noah! - Hayley! Hayley! - Noah! - Hayley! Hayley! - Come on! - Noah! No! Noah! Noah! Papers. - She's plague-free. - Get in. No! I'm not leaving without him! No! No! Hold them! Don't let them through! Stop them! Boarding is now complete. Departure for New Earth in T-minus one minute. All passengers report to Cryo immediately! How do I get off the ship? Sir, we have stowaways trying to breach the vents. Just report to Cryo. Come here. Ahh. Where's your mama? We'll find your mama, okay? Welcome. You are the last 1,000 passengers to board. The other passengers are already in Cryo. Please proceed to main hall before reporting to Cryo. I am Admiral Kiernan Adams. Welcome to my home, the U.S.S. Hercules. The Herc is the last quant-engine-enabled ship capable of making the journey to New Earth. As to the 41 other shuttles that have gone ahead to New Earth, well, I hope it's the paradise they said it would be. For the next six months, we will blaze across space and time. For most of us in Cryo, this journey will be but a dream. For our children, it will be the journey that gave them life. The worst is behind us. All hands to their stations. Hayley! - Hayley. - Noah? Ohh. - You okay? You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay. - We're fine. The baby's fine. - Yeah. - Hi. - Hey. - I thought I lost you. - Me, too. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. You gotta go. One second. - Are you okay? - I got her onboard, so where's that ship you promised me? You're lucky you're standing on this one. - Hold on. You promised me... - I expect you to fucking move. Go on. Move. You're late. Hi, sir. I'm, uh, Noah. Let me guess. You are the dead man walking that knocked up my unmarried daughter and made her drop out of West Point. No, this is not. This man helped us. He helped us get on the ship, saved my life, saved our lives. Is that right? I guess I owe you. No, sir. Glad you're safe. All right. I don't get why you don't tell him. Your dad's gonna find out eventually. I know. I can't wait for him to know you. I just want that to be in an environment where he can't open a window and... boot you into space. - You excited for the mission? - My "mission." Mm-hmm. You mean the custodial department? Yeah. Man in overalls... cleaning toilets, so much responsibility. It's gonna be fine. We're gonna get to New Earth, pop this sucker out, and then we get to be a family. You promise? I promise. Okay. Six months from now, it's you, me, and the little one on a New Earth beach. Hayley? Hayley! I love you. 50% of passengers in Cryo. All remaining crew members report immediately. Cryo inducement complete. Commencement of quantum jump in T-minus one minute. 100% of passengers in Cryo. Prepare for hyper-speed. Powering reactor. Oh, shit. Come on. Yeah, Torpedo Clay. Thought you were in fucking jail. Oh, my God. You made it, motherfucker. - You all right? - Clay Young, you beautiful soul. How long's it been? Oh! Okay, all right. Fair enough. - I probably deserve that. - All right? - Hi. - Hi. First jump? Just a little friendly advice. Would you get the fuck out of my seat? Come on. There you go. Okay. All right. Reactor at full power. Quantum jump in 10, 9... 8, 7, 6... 5, 4, 3... 2, 1. Hyper-speed commence. Fuck. Whoa. Holy shit. What happened? About 30 years. We're 30 years older? No, meatball, 30 years on Earth. It's quantum-release time dilation. So if 30 years passed on Earth... Everybody on Earth is dead. Look on the bright side, though. They're serving pancakes today. Think we'll ever return? We just left, and this motherfucker wants to go back. - Home is Earth. - Yeah? Well, we could wake the admiral, and we could see if he'll flip this bitch around. Why are we even going to New Earth? Just gonna fuck it up like we did the last one. Earth, we hardly knew you. Maybe we're going 'cause we don't wanna fucking die. Yeah, I thought that was obvious. You're right, you know. It's not like we learned anything. We're just a bunch of intergalactic monkeys setting fires across the universe. Clay telling war stories again? I love the one about the admiral demoting his ass for insubordination. Amazing. We leave 19 billion behind, but this space Nazi, he gets a seat. "Oh, I don't know, Admiral. I guess Clay just couldn't cope with leaving Earth. Drank himself stupid and jumped. Suicide." A stowaway, sir, the last one. Now... this is what happens to stowaways, fuck-ups, and anyone plotting against the admiral! - Take him away. - Fuck you! Fuck you! All right! Listen up! The Herc will hit New Earth in 182 days. Damn near all the ship, including the admiral, will be in Cryo, which means I'm your commander, your king, your God Almighty. Your fellow crew members will consist of six medics... Where are my medics? Six engineers... Where are my monkeys? Which leaves five JAG officers and myself to police your sorry asses and five janitors to question their lives' decisions. Any problems come up, you fix 'em your damn selves. Understood? Breakfast is over. Move! Motherfucker. Well... Arrival to New Earth, T-minus 171 days. Okay. What are you doing? I was just gonna ask you the same thing. The shift starts in 60. Stanley will break your legs if you're late. Hey, so if we're gonna be bunk buddies, that mean we're working the same shift? - Well, what do you think? - Hey, how 'bout... - how 'bout we start over? - Let's not. Hi. I'm Noah. Look, you want to get along, do your job, don't touch my stuff, don't talk to me, and do not snore. How will I know I'm snoring if I'm asleep? Well, you'll know it when I kick your teeth in. We got 59 minutes. Papa Clay needs his beauty sleep. Start work tomorrow. Only two bathrooms for the entire crew, so that's wonderful. Also, um... they say, 'cause of quant-speed, that time moves differently for us than it does on Earth... so... your mom... the plague probably got her... along with everyone else. I had a dream last night. Yeah, I dreamt it was a girl. What are you doing, rook? You're late. Let's go. Chop-chop. I'm going. Don't push me, rook. I'm a real nice guy. Just don't push me. All right? You know what you're doing? Bathrooms, linens, mess hall. Maybe there's hope for you yet. Not likely, but... maybe. There's your mop. Here's your bucket. Time to rock-'n'-roll, kid. Here we go. Oh, no. Three, two, one... Arrival to New Earth, T-minus 86 days. Made it to the halfway mark. We're almost home. Access denied. Access denied. What the fuck is wrong with you guys? Access denied. Only the admiral has access to the reactor! Hey, son... you snooping around the reactor room? No, sir. I don't even know where that is. If you saw anyone acting strange or... messing with things they shouldn't mess with, you'd tell me, right? Of course, sir. Lot of people are upset about us leaving Earth. They think humankind had its shot... that it's unnatural for us to be colonizing another planet. They'd rather torpedo this ship than see us start over. So like I said... you see anyone acting strange... you'd tell me, right? Yes, sir. Good. Good. - What'd Stanley want? - Nothing. If it's not coming off, you're not using the strong stuff. Like what? Did you completely dick off in training? Moxacell. You got to be careful, or that shit'll melt your face. All I'm saying is the Fermi paradox makes sense. What if... What if they're not hiding in space, huh? Could they be hiding in another time, another dimension? Well, everyone on the ship is now a lot dumber from listening to that conversation. Or could another alien civilization have been hit with an extinction-level event? I mean, we barely fucking survived the Nuclear Age. The plague, we still haven't cured... Right? Hmm... Moxacell. "Extreme cleaning power." Fuck. Oh, shit. Shit. "One drop per gallon of water." Come on. - Blue! - Huh? Hurry it up, will you? What the fuck is the rush? Oh, God. Oh, yeah. We ain't getting anything done. Anyway, I'm so fucking high, I couldn't even think about working right now. Fuck that. What's up, man? I drank something earlier. You're starting to freak me out, brother. Whoa! Seriously, you fucking with me? Whoa! What, what, what? Oh, God! Ohh! Call Chambers! What do you mean, "Call Chambers?" Call her now! What? Whoa, whoa! Just get it out! - What the fuck are you doing? - Get it out! Get what out? You're fucking freaking me out! I'm burning! Agh! Agh! It's burning! - Drink this! - It's burns! Drink this! Good. Drink it. Oh, my God. Are you all right? You okay? Say something, bro. Say something. Shady. Shady! What do you know? Heartburn. Heartburn? You fucking idiot. What... Clay, I finished the floors. Clay, can I go? Clay! Clay, you in there? What are you doing? - Uh... - You following me? - I... - Let me ask you a question. - Sit down. - What is all this? I said sit down! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! - I just finished my shift. I... - I saw Clay stealing jet fuel, and he had Moxacell. - What? Spit it out. - Clay's making a fucking bomb! Is that true, Clay? You got him? Right. Let's go. Come on! Stand up! I didn't see anything. Did you bring it? Do you want to start, or should I? You know, he knows about you. What exactly does the commander know? That you're with the rebellion. That you're trying to blow up the ship, trying to get revenge for all those people you left behind. He said all that, huh? And if anything happens to me, he's gonna go looking. You guys should move back. This could get messy. Make it easy, kid. Open your mouth. No, please. I'm not gonna say anything. Open your mouth. Please, I have a family. I have a family. What the fuck? Wait. So you're not making a bomb. You're making... Moonshine. Well, it's mostly acid cleaner. So... So you're not trying to blow up the ship? What the hell are you talking about? I saw you stealing fuel cells. Jet fuel, gives it a good kick. Torpedo Clay's special recipe. So now that we know and we know that you know, we, uh, think it's best that we keep this between us. If Commander Stanley finds out, we are all looking at a court-martial, all of us. And if I don't? Blackmailing me? Got 84 days. What do you say? All right! Let's have some fun. What do you think? - Oh, what was that? - Hear, hear. We can confiscate their booze. So they paid an ad agency to come up with the phrase "New Earth." I mean, shit, I could come up with that. New Earth. We fucked up the old, so here's a new one. My brother made it on the first ship. Who do you have waiting for you? Nobody. Just your family? I don't have a family. I thought you told us you had a family. Um, back on Earth. Just my mom, and she had to stay behind. So it's just me now. There was a girl. Ah, here we go. Alex. A real lady. Hmm. She married my brother. She married your brother? Is he still breathing? Clay's a lover, not a fighter. Ain't that right? One day, you're young, and... you got the world at your feet. And the next, you're, well... whatever the fuck we are. I'm gonna go find me some Blue. Where are those jackasses? If it's gonna fail, why go? Because I'm good at failing up. Where are you getting reassigned? - Reassigned? - You know, the new job we get when we land. Oh. Um, butcher. Just not too fucking sharp. Blucher. Blucher! Where are you? Hey, where you been hiding? Blue. You only get one chance at this. Oh, jeez. Locating New Earth assignment. Garbageman. That's more like it. - Clay. - Should have known. First jump. You don't know your assignment. Can't clean for shit. Please. I-I can explain. Good. I'm giving you 10 seconds before I call Stanley. No, look, you don't understand. Five, four, three, two, one. Okay, I wasn't picked for New Earth. I'm... I'm technically a stowaway. Do you know what they do to stowaways? Okay, I lied before, okay? I do have a family, and she's on the ship. Her name is... Hayley Adams. You idiot. You knocked up the admiral's daughter. Are you suicidal? - I didn't know who her dad was. - His face is everywhere! I'm just trying to do the right thing here, okay? Clay, report. - Please, Clay. - You know the shit you just put me in? Look, I'm just trying to do right by them. Clay, Goddamn it! Where are you? If you're gonna tell him, just... I don't know, give me a head start, at least, okay? Please? Clay? Clay. Jesus. Oh, what is this? Where's Blue? It's, um... it's Shady. What the hell did you do to him? Teek found him like this. Shady is everywhere. So where the fuck is Ensign Blucher? Blue couldn't have done this. I don't know what could have done this. Uh, decompression, maybe, but, uh, if there was a leak in the Herc, - we'd all be dead. - Ortega's also missing. No, she's not. She just went looking for Blue. Clay, we're calling up the footage now, trying to figure out what happened, but it might take a minute. We need to get all the crew in on the search. I worked with Blue for 10 years. He didn't do this. Kid, just in case I'm wrong, Blue's a big boy. Give him some room. Mmm. Attention, all crew. Engineer Blucher Macon and Senior Doctor Isabella Ortega have gone missing. Report at once to begin a sweep of the ship. Nothing. You? No. Is the feed telling us anything yet? Not yet. We're still searching. All right. Well, I found Ortega. - What'd she say? - Nothing. Blue bashed her head in. What do you think he wants with the admiral? Blue, what the fuck are you doing? We found Shady and Ortega. Come on, buddy. You want Stanley to use his cannon? Drop the cutter. Turn around! Oh, fuck. What happened to him? I'm ordering you to lay down your weapon. Put your weapon down, and surrender. It's your final warning. Lay down your fucking weapon! I don't think he's gonna listen. Goddamn it, Blue. He's gonna kill you. Shoot him! Jesus Christ, how did he do that? We need to stop the bleeding. Can't find an artery. Is he dead? Is he dead? Yeah, he's gone. So is Xu. That's not just cabin fever. He ate Xu's neck. He ate it. We need to find out what happened. What's taking so long with the feed? I'm going as fast as I can. It's one room, Teek. Why does he look like that? Something seems to be dissolving him from the inside out. We have to do an autopsy. You guys go. I need to be alone. You okay? Arriving to New Earth, T-minus 85 days. Anything? Not yet. Goddamn it. Dr. Susan Chambers, 12:30 a.m., May 4th. I am beginning the autopsy. I will start collecting samples for DNA sequencing. What happened? Stanley just locked us in. More time is needed to evaluate these results. I will begin now to make my first incision and visual assessment. Just get it out! - What the fuck are you doing? - Get it out! Get what out? There's nothing inside him. Drink that! Drink that! What do you mean, nothing? What... I know you can hear me! How long are we supposed to sit here? Hey, do you think something happened? How the fuck would I know? Chambers! Teek! Somebody! Open the goddamn door! Let's go. So you misplaced some organs? No. I was alone with Blue all night. When I cut him open, his spleen, his heart, his nervous system, his blood had basically been eaten down to nothing. Eaten? Like "eaten"? Wait. So if Blue didn't have anything inside him... Then how could he still move? It's 'cause he was being controlled from the inside. Let me show you something. The strand on the left belongs to Blue, just like yours and mine... proteins, lipids, the building blocks of all life in the universe. Strand on the right, also Blue, except it's not even carbon-based. It's not human. If I'm guessing... Blue picked up some sort of virus or a parasite. Invades the body of the host and then wears it like a cheap suit. So how did it get onboard? I had the ship do a head count after you found Ortega, just to make sure that nobody else had gone missing, and I found this. Noah's not in the system. He's using forged papers. Don't fucking move! Wait, wait, wait. I can explain... - I can explain. - Hey, hey! Oh, whoa, whoa. - What was the fucking plan? - No! I don't know! Infect the crew? Then eat our guts while you sink the ship? No! Fucking no! He's not trying to kill us. He's just a scared kid trying to survive, like the rest of us. Any more secrets? So if this asshole didn't let it in, we need to find out who did and what we're dealing with. Show them. They deserve to know. Holy shit. And look. They're not alone. So when you said parasite, you meant... Alien. And it might still be out there. If it's out there, we kill it. What is it? - I don't know. - Where did it come from? Again, I don't know. So how does a thing like that sneak onboard without us knowing? Because somebody had to bring it onboard. Do we know who did it? What are you doing? We have to wake up the admiral. - No, we don't. - Something is on this ship killing his men. This is his responsibility. Well, the paranoid bastard made sure we couldn't break into his quarters, let alone wake him from Cryo. And I don't trust the stowaway, so he goes out the air lock. Stanley, let him go! Guys. Guys! Clay, look up! Fuck you, motherfucker! Get to the arsenal. Hey, the crew are still locked in. Cabin doors opening. What's happening? Someone's letting them out. That's impossible. Only Stanley can do that, and he's dead. Not anymore. Move! Move! - Did you find Blue yet? - Run, you fucking idiots! Get inside! Lock the doors! What the fuck? - Go. - What is it? I already told you I don't know. Blue, Ortega, and Xu were all dead, so how the fuck is it still able to control them? - I didn't bring it on the ship. - Think! Try anything! - I said I don't know! - Everybody knock it off! He doesn't know anything! Look, I didn't fight my way onto the ship so I could kill anyone. I'm here so I could protect my family. We won't have long before they find us. Okay. Then what are we supposed to do? - We need to get to security. - What, and send a message? There's no signal with JAG command until we're closer to New Earth. All right, Doc, how do we kill it? I don't know. Bullets only slowed them down. Brute force didn't work. What about fire? - Might work. - Good enough for me. You remember how to use one of those things? What do you think? Where are you going? - To get Hayley! - Noah, stop! Listen. What is that? Get away from the door. Jesus Christ. They're all dead. Don't let 'em trap us below-deck. We need to get to the security bay. Light 'em up! Ahh! You fuckers! Stand back. It's not working! Keep firing! Fire alarm! Cover your eyes! Okay, it looks like they're gone. We're sitting ducks in here. We gotta move. Let's get to the security bay. - Can't see! - Neither can they, so shut the fuck up. Where are you? I'll cover. Hey, guys, can somebody tell me what the fuck is going on? Teek! I can't see him. Cover me. Wait! - Should we go after him? - No. No, they're gone. Clay? We have to get out of here. - Just wait! Clay! - Clay? If you can hear us... duck! Something's coming. - We gotta get off the ship. - Escape pods are over there. Where are we gonna go? We're nowhere near New Earth. All right, let's go to the, uh, security bay. - Okay. Okay, this way. - Come on. Let's go. Follow me. Follow me. I'm outta here. You coming, kid? Good luck. - Where's your access card? - Top right pocket. Got it. We gotta patch him up. I'm locking us in. Jesus! You been working out, Stanley? Hey, Stanley. Come on. Arrival to New Earth, T-minus 84 days. We have nowhere left to go, and we have no one to call. We need to be strategic. So tired of fucking running. We need to face these bastards head-on. We're all gonna die. Bullets won't work... fire... Can't be killed. It's death. Hey, guys... come up with a plan? I-I can't tell you how to kill it if I don't know what it is. If someone brought it, they had to have a reason. Well, we had a good run. Not bad for a bunch of drunks. So we're supposed to sit here and wait for them to tear us apart? No. We're gonna get drunk and wait for them to tear us apart. - You think this is funny? - You hear anyone laughing? We are outmatched, outgunned, and we need reinforcements. Aren't you supposed to be some sort of fucking badass? You just looking out for yourself? Yeah, so were you when you snuck on the ship. No, I'm looking out for my family. Who are you looking out for? Wait. Where does that go? The vent, where does it go? Vents go a lot of places. - Does it reach the admiral? - Oh, shit. All right, damn you. Have it your way. For the record, this is a terrible idea. But I'll give you a shot. You wake the admiral. He blows 'em all up. You get your girl. Yeah. Easy. It's gonna be tight. Just keep moving, and do exactly what I say. Aw, what are you waiting for? Up and at 'em, hero. Which way do I go? Clay, can you hear me? Please stop doing that. First turn's coming up. After that, go 200 feet. Take your next two lefts. You wanna hurry it up, son? Taking first left. - Now where? - Stop. - They're coming. - What? They're all around you. Move. Taking second left. Now what? Clay, what's happening? Hope they eat you first. I'm sorry. God, please forgive me. Don't start praying yet, Teek. Kid might be onto something. Clay. - Clay? - I'll tell you when to stop. Listen to me. Xu and Ortega, they're here. They didn't see you. Keep moving. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Almost there, kid. Keep going. I have to tell you something. I... I did it. It was me. Teek. What did you do? Tell us. I-I thought it would be quick. I-I thought it would... I thought it would kill us fast. Teek... tell me what you did. - Teek. - You're lying. - You didn't do it. - It was me! They found me. Run! Left or right? Left or right? Take a right. We're gonna die because of you. Get up! Clay, what's going on? I'll deal with you later. Think I'm lost. Where's Xu and Ortega? Which way do I go? There should be a vent to your right. What's the holdup? You again. Why would you want to hurt us? Everything's not about "us." There are 300,000 souls on this ship, good people just trying to make a fresh start on a better planet. Isn't that what you maniacs preach about? What about them? Maybe mankind had its chance. See, we can't keep destroying everything that we touch. There's a lot of us who get it. We see humanity for the parasite that it is. Shame on you. We get what we deserve. What is it? You brought it here. You don't know? Where'd it come from? Did you find it? You cook it up in a lab? Did it fall from the sky? Where is it from? The experiments. So they made it. No, we didn't make it. We brought it back. You brought it back from where? Another planet? Another universe? Maybe it was here from before the universe. And it's gonna kill us all, even you, because you told it to. No. Because it wants to. Because that's all it knows. All right, all right, I heard enough of this monster. Are you sober enough to return to active service, Captain? Just like the old days. Anything else I should know? It's getting smarter. We've already found it targeting the reactor and your bunker, sir. And where is this horde now? All right. There's no need to complicate things. Let's kill 'em all, flush 'em out the air-vac. How's that sound? Works for me, sir. Ah, look here. Wake 'em up. Strap up. Move out. We, uh, graduated from the same academy. Majored in orbital warfare. - Clay? - Once upon a time... he was a warrior. He disobeyed orders during the Eos uprising. He refused to fire on protestors during the riots. He got blue falconed back to rear detachment. Wait a second. Hey, what's the status on Cryo? Don't worry. She's fine. Who's fine? Hayley. You... you're the father. Whoa, sir. He's an idiot, but he's our idiot. We might need him. I'll deal with you later. Commander! Orbital 1701, ready to maim, murder, and kill on your command, sir. We are here to hunt. We are here to kill. We are here to survive. Lead the way, son. How much time do we have? About two seconds longer than him. Here goes nothing. Watch your six. Safeties off. My God. Captain Stanley? Is that you? Okay. Have it your way. Secondary positions! Go! Go! No, no, no! - Get inside! - I know how to kill it! Little closer. Come on. Hey, kid, you tell Hayley I think she'll be all right. W-wait! He blew himself up. That crazy motherfucker. So I guess it's over now. Hey! Where you going? - Get Hayley! - Who's gonna mop this up? You gotta be fucking kidding me. What is this thing? We have to get out of here. Come on! Let's go! Where are we going? To get Hayley and get off the ship. Go where? We're a billion miles from everywhere. What was that? Something new. Moxacell. Moxacell? I used it on Blue, and it worked. And you're just now telling us? You sure he was dead? This thing has tricked us before. I watched him melt away to nothing. Wh-where is it? That way. Clay, what about your stash? Where's the moonshine? Down in the arsenal. Access to reactor granted. Welcome, Admiral. Be advised. High counts of radiation. Do not expose skin. We tried fire. Yeah, but this, this'll melt them to jelly. Trust me. We just have to get close. Are they coming? What the fuck was that? The ship is shaking. Estimated time of arrival to New Earth has been updated to T-minus 80 days and counting. Eighty days? Does that sound right? Arrival in T-minus 79 days and counting. No, how is that possible? Updated. Seventy-eight days and counting. What's happening? They're hitting the fucking gas. Reactor power increased to 60%. Reactor power increased to 67%. They're overheating the reactor. We can't take much more of this. - How did they even get inside? - We let it. It tried for the reactor with Blue. When that failed, it went for the admiral, the only person on this ship with access to the reactor, and when we stopped it, it came for us, because it knew we would find some way to wake him up. It's been playing us all along. Get away from the door. You gonna grab one of these? Has the ship changed course? - What? - No. And there's no aliens trying to eat us? - They've left us alone? - What the fuck? So we're on a ship headed to New Earth at the speed of light with an unstable reactor - and an alien? - Yeah, we got it. So why kill 300,000 when you can kill an entire planet? You're talking about 50 million people. The last 50 million. All right. Who wants barbecue? I guess that worked. So that's it? No, this is just what it looks like when everything's been boiled in acid. All right, Doc. Wrap it up. Who in the hell are these people? It must have run out of crew. It's infecting the passengers. Hayley. Goddamn it. We need to get them away from the reactor. Come on! We're right here! - Hey! Over here! - Over here! They're not gonna stop. Burn 'em. It's working! There are too many. We won't be able to get through. Get Hayley to the escape pod. We'll cover you. Go! Hayley. Hayley. Hayley! I'll get you out. Hi. - Hey. - We made it? - You okay? - Mm-hmm. Here. - What is this for? - We have to go. - Come on. Just trust me. - What? Just trust me, all right? We have to go. Right now, we have to go. Wait. Where's Dad? We gotta go. Noah. Come on. Where is he? Look, he sacrificed himself so we could have a chance. I-I'm sorry, but we have to go. Otherwise, it'll be for nothing. Please. Wait. Watch out. What the fuck is that? We have to go! Clay, let's go! Let's get the fuck off this ship! Get to an escape pod. - What are you gonna do? - Improvise! It's behind you! That is an ugly motherfucker. Clay. Clay, we've gotta go. Clay, we have to go right fucking... Watch out. Fucking motherfucker. Get into the escape pod. Clay. Clay! Clay! Noah. Noah, we have to go. Noah, we have to go! Hey! Arrival to New Earth updated, T-minus 17 days and counting. Arrival to New Earth updated, T-minus 15 days and counting. Okay. - Get inside. Let's go. - What are you doing? I have to hit the launchpad. It's the only way to get us out of here. Be right back, okay? Come on. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Okay. How you doing, kid? Clay, you're alive? Well, I wouldn't go that far. Can you get to us? The chambers are overrun. The ship's moving too fast to stop it. It's over. Clay, there's 300,000 fucking people onboard. And you gotta save three.
