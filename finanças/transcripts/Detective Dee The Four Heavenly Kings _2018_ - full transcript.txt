This is the Dragon-Taming Mace. Forged in iron from stardust. Harder than the Golden Stone. I grant the mace to you for safekeeping. Use it to defeat evil, as is your duty. Protect our nation, keep all things in balance. If anyone, even me... Should threaten... Our nation... You are empowered... To control them with the Mace. I am honored, Your Majesty! DEE DETECTIVE: THE FOUR HEAVENLY KINGS Your Majesty... you handed the Dragon-Taming Mace to Dee. But what if he turned against us? Our nation will be helpless against him. Dee almost lost his life to the Sea Dragon. He saved me from death, rescued our ministers. He's no conspirator or betrayer. That's your justification. But aren't you thinking of using him against me? How can you think that, my consort? For your sake... I have ended dynasty long traditions. Repealed the old laws and made new ones. Now we rule together. I have done so much. How can you not trust me? Your Majesty, my Empress. Yuchi Zhenjin... I know that you and Dee are close sworn brothers. But if I ordered you to take the Mace from him... Could you do that? Your Majesty, if Dee loses the Mace... He will face the death penalty. If you follow my order... You have my solemn word... Dee and his family will suffer no punishment. In that case, Your Majesty... Nothing will stop me from serving you. Have you found the men I asked for? Your Majesty... This man is from Huan Tian, ​​the Taoist. I am only... merely a man from jianghu, Your Majesty. Huan Tian... ​​I hear tell you can summon wind and rain. My talents are modest, Your Majesty. But as you commanded... I have brought men with great skills. They are at the court's service. Show me what they can do. Spectral Blades, from the Huandao Clan. "Samantabhadra." Night Ghost, from Qianshou Clan. My Lord, please... It's a trick cup! These are indeed modest tricks of the jianghu. Your deceptions are an affront! - What is your name? - Smoke Volant, from Xianqi Clan. Your Majesty... These are mere jianghu trifles! Such charlatans...... Should not be trusted. Huan Tian... These men are all you have to show me? Your Majesty... Since this gentleman mistrusts us... I will be bold enough to wager him. If his sword can strike Your Majesty's shadow... I will submit to your punishment. How dare you? You speak of Her Majesty's shadow? Your guilt is self-evident! Not guilty! - Your Majesty... - Unsheath your blade! Immediately! Forgive me, Your Majesty. Hidden demon, show yourself! Water Moon, from Fuyin Clan. You're lucky... Your head is still on your body. Her Majesty's mercy has spared you. Show her your appreciation. The jianghu has remarkable talents. I'm happy with your service. Conceal yourselves nearby and await orders. I name you the Mystic Clan! Follow Yuchi's orders. Be ready to retrieve the Mace. Yes, Your Majesty. One moment, Your Majesty. This matter is too weighty to trust to strangers. I can retrieve the Mace alone. They are here to help you. I leave you to proceed. BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONS Master! Have you seen Master Dee? Isn't he in his room? Master, a message from the Duty Office. A strange theft from the painter Leng Yu! Master! I know, get the horses ready! He's always popping up without warning these days. You can find Dee's official residence on that map. And how to take the Mace. You people will have to handle it! What's that? Some strange design appeared on the ground, like a map. Did you see it? LENG YU'S STUDIO Lord Dee is here. - Please, my lord. - The victim is Leng Yu, a famous painter. He does old style pictures of maids... Flowers, horses, that kind of thing. Very true to life. Much praised. It went to his head. He's been working on a new picture. "Steeds Crossing the River". Someone broke in and stole it. They set fire to his other paintings. The losses are great. Even scarier... His folks have gone missing. No-one knows where they are. The thief left too many clues. - I think... - Shh... You see, I ... - Who are you people? - From the Bureau of Investigations. You are painter Leng? - Bureau of Investigations? - Don't be rash, Mr. Leng. Was it you who reported this? - See that? - What was it? Fireflies! It's not quite spring yet. How could that be? This is Dee's bedroom. The room is arranged in the Nine-Star pattern. This is where things should be hidden. He wants us to think the Mace is hidden here. We should think the opposite way to find it! How many people have seen "Steeds Crossing the River"? No-one! Are you trying to tell me something? No. You're doing it again! Why do you keep blinking at me? I have an eye problem. It's... congenital. A congenital eye problem? - I think you're afraid of something. - No, I'm not. I think this fellow staged the whole thing. Maybe trying to boost his prices. I doubt it. If that was it... Why would he need to hide his family? Right, he wouldn't need to do that. Those footprints... All of the clues are just a trap. Someone wants us to spend time here at this very moment. They are waiting for us to take the bait. Yes! But... The footprints show that the thief... came from that direction. Look! There are footprints here too. Could something be hidden there? My painting! Don't move! Stay right there. Since the painting is still here... ...we're being tricked in some way. Don't touch it! - There's poison! - What is it? Careful, everyone, there's poison. Stay still, let's seal off your acupoints. You... The dust on the desk is poisoned too! Hold your breath. On the roof! It's a dummy! Smoke Volant was spotted. If the poison doesn't kill Dee... We'll finish him off... - ... on his way back to the Bureau. - Good! Let's go! Stop! You're under my command. Who told you to poison him? You're asking for it! Han Ping. - Take off your robe. - Don't touch mine, it's poisoned. This is how we get things done! Sir... Are you trying to stop us getting paid? Ridiculous! Your blood should have flowed days ago! Attack a member of the Golden Guard... ... and you attack the Emperor himself. You dare? The thief is playing with us. Yi An, Zhou Jin... Stay right behind me. Wait for me at the western corner. - Let's bring him into the open. - Yes sir! That's the best you can do? You seem quite timorous. I think we'll see your end today. Let's go. - Who are you? - What are you doing there? Throw ropes around her! Watch her feet! - Dee! - You can't go anywhere. Watch out! - Ha ha ha... - Up there! Don't let him get away! Move away from there! - Master. - I'm alright. - How about you two? - Alright. What was all that for? It seems to me... Someone set all this up. They just wanted us out of the Bureau. But look what's happened now. They're targeting us too. Night Ghost... This is too easy. Watch out! - What the...? - The alarm! Quick! It's a trap. Let's get out now. Careful. Master Dee knew they'd come. See what instructions Master left for us. "Let them escape." That Dee Renjie... What is that man thinking? Yuchi Zhenjin... You and the Mystic Clan lost the first round... ... of your challenge to Dee. You spirited away Leng's family. What are you going to do with them? Lord Yuchi planned this strategy. That's why it failed. Maybe I suggest... that Your Majesty... makes Yuchi follow ordes! That's enough! How dare you? You were the one who didn't follow orders! And you are not ashamed to lie. Your Majesty... Shouldn't the problem be solved... By the one who started it? The Dragon-Taming Mace is vital to the nation's future. So, if I am allowed to make any advice... The Emperor should take it back from Dee. Advise? You think that would help? Back when the Tang Dynasty was being built... ...some predicted future struggles within the royal family. They tried to "advise" the Emperor. But he wouldn't listen. Two years later the struggle broke out. It was known as the "Xuanwu Gate Rebellion". You really think "advice" will help? Dee Renjie... SANZANG TEMPLE The emperor now values you highly. And is waiting for you. You should be proud of yourself. But you come to this ruined temple to see me. What worries lies deep in your heart? Give me your hand. Hell is full of sufferers. So enlightenment must wait. Well said, well said. What I wrote on your palm was spontaneous. What you said was from your innermost being. Each person has inner demons. When they loom up... They cannot be avoided. When that day comes... This token will find me. Yuan Ce... Hell is full of sufferers. So enlightenment must wait. I must enter hell to save others. Master Dee! Master Dee! Dee! Master Dee, why has this sickness returned? Something in my mind is affecting my body. The Dragon-Taming Mace brings many troubles. You always solve such problems. But maybe this time I cannot. Wait here. Yes. Lord, this is such a terrible dungeon. I've accompanied Her Majesty here many times. But I have never dared ask... Who is it that is confined here? It's the minister who predicted the Xuanwu Gate Rebellion. The man whose advice was ignored. He was locked in here... ...by the Emperor who led the Rebellion. He was stripped of his rank and family name. His body was tortured. They even disfigured his face. Now he's known as "The Faceless Lord". Old one... You've come again. Wait for me over there. I'll wait here. Yes, my Lord. All those years ago... When you first came to see me... You asked me how to become the Empress. You promised you would rehabilitate me. And my family. Now you are indeed the Empress! What is there left to trouble you? Dee Renjie now holds the Dragon-Taming Mace. You advised me to convene the Mystic Clan. But they are no match for Dee. You need to boost their standing in the court. That's how you make yourself more powerful! Take over the the Bureau of Investigations. Make Dee hand over the Mace. How can I take over the Bureau? How can I force Dee to hand over the Mace? Ha ha ha... By the Lords of heaven... I am Yuchi Zhenjin of His Majesty's Golden Guards. By command of the Empress... I am here for the training exercises. Do you take us for fools? Are you here to challenge the Bureau? Tell me, what's the point of this training? I think you shameless people... - ...are here to go after Master Dee! - That's absurd. I'm doing my duty here. I should come after you! That's fine. Next time you ask me for medical treatment, I'll have a snake poison you... And then I'll save you at the point of death! How about that? Ha ha ha... Ha ha ha... Ha! Master Dee, you really want to do that? - He's really doing it! - Take care, Master Dee! No one can do that! It's too unstable! Idiot! Your Golden Guard came up with this stunt, didn't they? No one could stand up there! Call an end to it! Master! I'm alright. The trick you taught me actually did work. If you lose balance... You can flip in mid-air... And that helps decrease the impact. Master Dee... He's trying to trap you. Don't trust him. Are you alright? He's fine. Yuchi, come with me. I have something for you. Yuchi, I know the Empress commanded you. And I know that many times... You have shown your humanity. You are a dutiful officer. Dee... I feel ashamed to face such an old friend. This is for you. This is from the time we fought the sea dragon. I made this while I was defending ShallowTower. You're giving it back? Are you making fun of me? Her Majesty favors you, but both of us are embattled. We need to keep an eye on the bigger picture. And I need your help. So I've written some lines for you... in the corner of your picture. "The Four Heavenly Kings bless our country." "Great virtue is hidden in our world." "A secretive person seeks it." "Cultivating life, holding a blade." Can't make head or tail of it, Dee! Let it sink in. This Bureau may turn to your Golden Guard... ... for help in the future. You're very smart. Instead of arousing Her Majesty's suspicions... ...why not set out to win her trust? If the Empress transferred her favor to me, then she wouldn't cause me trouble. You would! Absolutely not! I also want to live free and honest. Not caught up in intrigues. Free and honest? Look at the way you're dressed! You belong in that armor. You jest! This heavy armor bears... ...no comparison with the Dragon-Taming Mace. Neither of us have an easy path. Who can say what the future will bring? Take care of yourself, sworn brother! Yes, sworn brother! Take care! Sha Tuo... Do you realize we've been spied on. By who? Who'd dare to spy on the Bureau of Investigations? The one who tried to steal the Mace. They failed last time. But they'll be back very soon. And it will be an open attack. An open attack? Dee... When you were given the Dragon-Taming Mace... Was it good or bad luck for you? - Here comes another one. - Yes, another magician type is here. Our Empress... likes watching their tricks. Many are summoned to the palace. Learning magic tricks is popular now. Yes, everyone is following suit. No one cares about trades. Eveyone's abandoning their trades. And trying to learn magic tricks instead! You bet! Those magic tricks... ...can bring the benefits rolling in! Boss! It's that mysterious design again! Sir, the yams have arrived! I've packed them up for you. Come, come! - I'm waiting for you to pick them up. - Boss, are you from Tiele too? Tiele dialect! You haven't paid yet. Boss, it's a mistake, I didn't order them. No mistake! It's me! Dee... You're in danger! Get out of here. We're being watched... Mount up! - But you... - Listen, I'll be out of sight for a while. If you need me, see the note in the medicine box. Thank you, sir. Don't move! What kind of disguising skill is this? Damn you! Spying on me? Those jianghu magicians are useless. I thought they could be used to get the Mace. And to finish off Dee Renjie. But they're just getting in the way. Let's kill them all. Meanwhile... This power hungry demon... "EMPRESS" is controlled by our sorcerer. Let's see how she takes over the Bureau tomorrow! The Empress is here! She's outside the Bureau of Investigations gate! The Empress is here! Outside the Bureau of Investigations gate! All ranks assembled! Prepare to greet Her Majesty. Prepare to greet Her Majesty. What? Master Dee was right again! They're almost here. So flagrant! Where are you, Dee? Oh yes, the medicine chest. This is it! A report from the Imperial Court! A member of the royal family has been wounded by this Mace. Is it the authentic Dragon-Taming Mace? I command Master Dee to show the Mace in his keeping. Then we will know for sure. Your Majesty... Master Dee is in his home town on family business. As for the Dragon-Taming Mace... We actually... don't know where it's kept. Dee Renjie is absent. That's a perfect reason for the Empress... ... to take control of the Bureau. Dee Renjie! Leader of the Bureau of Investigations! You neglect your duties! It is unthinkable! The Bureau must have a leader. For public safety, I take command of the Bureau. Now I must inspect the premises. - Guide me! - Yes, Your Majesty. Please, Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Master Sha Tuo. Your Majesty... The Bureau's scale is modest, you have seen it all... Except the bathing area, the kitchen. And... the toilets. Then assist me... to inspect those places. Search diligently and report to me. Yes, Your Majesty. Sir... The toilets are nearby. So let's start there. More than a hundred latrines in each toilet! Don't think you can finish it, better shovel the shit back. BATH HOUSE - Master Sha Tuo... - Ignore me. Where? Dee! There you are. Sorcery... Dee! Dee! That formula needs improvements. They're here! Just as you said! The Empress brought in these jianghu charlatans. They're looking for the Mace. The Dragon-Taming Mace. Is it somewhere safe? It's a grave situation. So how come you're so excited? Oh, congratulations. You've encountered someone? You're right! A woman assassin! Excellent. From now on... Your mission is to watch her closely. And maybe develop your relationship. Develop our relationship? I don't think so. She looks fierce, she scares me. Never mind that. It's Bureau work. We're always dealing with dangerous types. You should be used to it. The Empress makes is making big trouble. I'm not in the mood for love. That design! I've seen it before, just outside the Bureau. Yes, I've been looking into it. It's called the "Zhanbojia". It's the symbol of a clan in India. They practice sorcerous possession. They can control minds... And manipulate actions. Their adherents found their way here long ago. They helped the late Emperor build our great dynasty. So he named them the Wind Warriors. But he came to mistrust them and locked them up. They've been invisible for years. But now this symbol is appearing in this city. I think there are renegade disciples behind it. Dangerous people with weird skills. If they turn the Empress against the Bureau... ...it will be a very serious matter. The Empress and the jianghu sorcery... There will be terrible consequences. You've been here too long, you should go back! Go on, hurry back! Miss! What the... You ugly man, stop pretending. Why did you take so long to bathe? Some problem? You were watching me! You know how long I took! If I want to watch, I watch. You like bathing, don't you? Go on! I'll watch! Understood. We should go. That does it. You have no idea... There's a lot of gossip in the Bureau of Investigations. Seeing us together, there may be rumors. Please tell Her Majesty that I'm blameless. Then she'll let me off. That's enough! I'll advise the Empress to castrate you! That will end any rumors. I've seen enough for today. I'll come back tomorrow. Rumors? Pah! When will you bathe? I'll watch you! Her Majesty favors you... We need to keep an eye on the bigger picture. I've written some lines for you... in the corner of your picture. "The Four Heavenly Kings bless our country." "Cultivating life, holding a blade." A blade? A Mace? The Dragon-Taming Mace! The lines mention the Four Heavenly Kings. "Great virtue is hidden in our world." "Great Virtue" is an archway in the city south. Very close to the Temple of Heavenly Kings! So perhaps the Dragon-Taming Mace... "Cultivating life"... That represents Heavenly King of Growth! The "blade"... The Dragon-Taming Mace! We need to keep an eye on the bigger picture... The Bureau may turn to your Golden Guard... ...for help in the future. Our help in the future? He wants me to protect the Dragon-Taming Mace! Come, come. Hand me the Dragon-Taming Mace. I will take credit for finding it. In my eyes, you're worthless. Your speak more nonsense than Huan Tian! You got here... ... just in time to die. Ha ha ha... The Dragon-Taming Mace. Forged in iron from stardust! Harder than the Golden Stone. Your Majesty, if Dee loses the Dragon-Taming Mace... He will face the death penalty. I am afraid that... If you follow my order... You have my solemn word, Dee and his family will suffer no punishment. In that case, Your Majesty... Nothng will stop me from serving you. Lord Yuchi, please wait outside. You're here! Lord Yuchi... You were indisposed today. You missed important developments. As Her Majesty's right hand man... I worry about your condition. Please take care. I heard about you at the Bureau of Investigations in quite a tight corner. You should take care too. Her Majesty is here. Yuchi Zhenjin... Today you must congratulate Huan Tian Zhenren. I have promoted him... ... to the rank of Imperial Advisor. The Emperor is also eager to see... Huan Tian Zhenren's powers. To see if he can replace Dee Renjie. Your Majesty, Imperial Advisor is a key role. Please reconsider. Yuchi... What happened to your face? A training accident. Smoke Volant... You should respect the officer! Yuchi... You did your best. Since you need time to recover... ...please rest and wait for your orders. The Imperial Advisor can deal with other matters. Yes, Your Majesty. Zhenren... I hear you are resourceful. You solve mysteries and defeat devils. Even more talented than Dee Renjie! Kindly show me your skills. What can you do? Your Majesty, it's my honor! I'll control the elements to bless this great dynasty! Long live of our Noble Empress! No! Now see my thunder beads! Those are illusions made by machinery. No more than cheap trickery. They don't amount to much. Watch carefully, there's more to see. It's raining! It tastes so sweet! It's rain from heaven, real rain from heaven! Tiger in the wind, dragon in the clouds. Nature's power will deliver good harvests. And bless the nation and its people. Well said! These are just trifles. An Imperial Advisor should be much more skilled. Now a heavenly relic, the North Sea Dragon Ball. It blesses His Majesty and the people. It offers a glimpse of heaven itself. - May it please His Majesty. - Dragon Ball? It looks very much like the luminescent pearl... ... which An Nan gave me six years ago. Really? I don't think so... Huo Geng... Bring the relic. Your Majesty. What's happening, Huan Tian? Something's going wrong. No, this is not part of the plan. Someone is interfering. Someone? Who? The dragon! It's coming to life! Where did it come from? - Explain to the Empress! - I don't know what's happening. I cannot explain it to her! Then we should get out of here! How can we leave now? Protect their Majesties! It's a good omen! The golden dragon reborn! It's a dynastic omen! Ha ha ha... Huan Tian, ​​what is it doing? An illusion, it's an illusion. Protect their Majesties! Madam... - There's danger, Your Majesty! - Go away! The Dragon Ball! Huan Tian has gone. Huo Geng! Protect their Majesties and get them away! - I'll get him back. - Yes! Your Majesty... Seal the exits! - No one may leave! - Yes, sir! Stop him! We need more men! Quick! You are all Golden Guards. Stop! Stop! Catch him! He's a murderer. Drop your weapons! It wasn't me, he's getting away! Follow him! Quick! Drop your weapons! What fools you are. You in particular. Take me then! Whose idea was it to bring in those magicians? It was Yuchi Zhenjin's suggestion. You can ask him. Where is he? Your Majesty, Yuchi is under arrest. He killed members of the Golden Guard. Now he's in the prison. What? Put the city on alert. Summon Dee Renjie for duty! Yes, Your Majesty. It's a message from the Golden Guard. The golden dragon came to life in the palace! It flew away into the sky. Two magicians died, one is missing. And Yuchi must have gone mad. He killed a few of his own men. They've locked him up. So they've finally started to take action. Who? Who do you mean? Take this bamboo token. Find Master Yuan Ce at Sanzang Temple. Sanzang Temple... When Master Sanzang was in India... He was trying to counter its malign power. Now Master Sanzang has passed on. The only way to defeat them... is with the help of his disciple Yuan Ce. Show him this symbol. And ask him to help fight their sorcery. Is all this connected with the "Zhanbojia" people? They've been planning this for many years. They used the Mystic Clan as their agents.. Just to keep watch on us. Their sorcery is very powerful. We need to find a way to distract them. Call all the Bureau's men for duty. We'll divide into three teams to lure them. Lure them? The first team... Tell Zhou Jin to lead it. They must go to Bingzhou, pretending to look for me. That will draw their attention stay away from... the Bureau of Investigations. It's them again! What are they up to? Tell them... ... to split up and leave false trail. That will shake off the Mystic Clan. Then they return here to wait for my orders. The second team... Take the fastest horses. At East Market, change clothes and horses. Then ride to Sanzang Temple to find Master Yuan Ce. Boss, give me a new horse, please. The third team... I will disguise myself as Ding Xun's guard. And I'll follow Huo gang of the Golden Guard... into the Palace to investigate there. Very modest skills... Who are you people? I'm Water Moon, from Fuyin Clan. The Empress's flunky! We thought you were real killers. Now we know we overestimated you. So now your time is up. Time is up? You're talking nonsense! You're not the Empress. You're a fake! Who are you? Speak! Your name is Water Moon? You ought to know that your name also means... ... Illusion. They'll find me here. It's too dangerous here! Still here? I said, it's no good! You're so stupid. Such an idiot. - Idiot. - Tiele dialect? You're from Tiele? They're here, don't move. Shut up. Any more? Can't find her. "WATER MOON" Report! Guards from the Bureau just left the city. Maybe going for reinforcements. Absurd! Our loyal service earned us the name Wind Warriors. We help defeat the late Emperor's enemies. This dynasty would not exist without our help. But once he was enthroned...... ... the emperor turned against us. Even tried to wipe us out! Now his descendants live in comfort. "EMPRESS" "EMPEROR" And the dynasty prospers. Our colleagues are convening in the capital. We will bring down this dynasty! The dynasty must fall! Your dagger is here. You're not badly hurt. But you've been poisoned. I've drawn the venom from your wounds. Where am I? An inn near Ranfang. Sirs, please follow me. Two guests for Tianzi rooms! How did you draw out the poison? With my mouth. I cleaned out the wounds. Don't worry. Don't move! Traces of poison are still in your body. That's why you feel weak. If the poison had reached your heart... ...you'd be goner. It affected me. That's why I'm also drinking this. I have urgent things to do, I must go. Here are five more doses, take them as you need. I told you not to move. Come on... drink this. Don't touch me! Don't move, you're still weak. Drink this. You first! It's disgusting! Save your strength! You could still die. While you still can... - Drink it! - What is it to you if I live or die? If you wanna die, just die! Yoyr stubbornness kill you! But you shouldn't die so far from home. I don't wanna bury you here. Not my problem anuway. However, we from Tiele all believe... ...that no matter how far you roam... ...in the final days of your life... ...you should always go back to your homeland. And die there. Tiele is too far away. I can't get back there. And you? Why don't you go back there? I have duties to the court. I can't just go where I want. I'm not free, like you are. I can't choose where to go. You must have been through a lot... on your travels in the jianghu. Is it really too much for you? The bitterness of this medicine? I have to go. Take care of yourself. Will you come back for me? For sure. Why do you wear that strange make-up? I don't want anyone to see me as I am. I've never touched an assassin's face before. And I've never been friendly with an officer. When I went to the capital... I felt a deep bitter pain. Probably no less bitter... ... than this medicine. So try to bear it. Maybe it's not as bitter as you think. Trust me... friend. Stand to attention! I'm Huo Geng of the Golden Guard. And he is from the Bureau of Investigations. We are here to look into the incident. Enter! This is where it happened. The golden dragon came to live... in front of the Emperor and Empress. It killed some people and then flew away. That must have been something to see. Did you witness it yourself? - Yes, I was here. - I envy you! Officer Ding, are you really on this case? Indeed. My assistant is working on it. - Did the dragon hve big eyes? - What are you asking? So the Bureau sends just one man for this tough case? It seems inadequate. If Master Dee himself can't come... at least he should send Sha Tuo. The world of jianghu is full sorcery clans. Ultimately, they're just tricks. What is it? You've found something? Nonsense! How could that be? More than a hundred people saw it. Including the Emperor and Empress. Look! That's where the dragon flew away. See the hole it left in the ceiling? That was just a trick? Hmm! You saw what your mind told you to see. Breaking the ceiling is an easy jianghu trick. Anyhow... Don't believe all you see. Anyhow... The dragon's head was sliced off with a sharp blade. I estimate about five feet long. The same as the throne. Let's take a look. There were guards everywhere. Easier to hide it here than to bring it in. - Stop! - Do you all agree? How dare you? That's the imperial throne. No one may approach it. You didn't check it. That's why you were deceived. Stop! My assistant is better at this than me. Let him get on with it if you want the truth. This is standard operating procedure in the Bureau? You bet! Look! The truth! The dragon's head! This is the dragon you all saw? The one that flew away? Fine! Now, General Huo... Can you arrange for us to meet Lord Yuchi? You want to meet Lord Yuchi? He's... He's been arrested for criminal negligence. I have no authority... to let you visit him. The one with the authority... would be Lord Dee with his Dragon-Taming Mace. That would make it possible. So please go back. Here I am. Lead us there, General. General Huo! Fool! You're all fools! Leave me be. How dare you disturb me? You bring shame on the Golden Guard. All of you! You're such a bunch of idiots! I would never trouble you, sir. I am just escorting Dee Renjie. Master Dee, this way. Dee! I thought I'd never see you again. Yuchi... I didn't expect to see you so happy. See, now I really am an honest man free of intrigues! And Huan Tian is the criminal-in-chief! Let's get on his trail. You think Huan Tian could have set up such a show? And that he killed off two of his accomplices? And why is he hiding? Why would he bring trouble on himself? What? Hiding? Huan Tian is in hiding? Huan Tian is in hiding? We've scoured the city, no one can find him. Tell me about the moment they arrested you. Master Dee... We're on alert, we can't move without permission. The previous incident in this case took place here. The key to the truth is here. Powerful sorcery was deployed. Only one clan was capable of doing it. Have you heard of the Wind Warriors? They originated in India. Master Sanzang noted them when he was in India. By his account... They had thousands of followers. And took them to the border of heaven. Transcendent experiences... But actually achieved through sorcery. Their spells can play with the mind. They can manipulate behavior. Manipulate behavior? In that case, the dragon we saw flying... Once they'd been hypnotized... Everything they saw was an illusion. Where does this lead? - To the attendants' quarters. - Come. The sorcery will lose its power. The one who faked the dragon and kill the magicians... also hid Huan Tian. And all three things had to be done... while the spell was still effective. It happened in the West Corridor, where there's a shortcut to the attendants' quarters. They manage the imperial carriages. Where are the carriages parked? "ATTENDANT QUARTER" - General Huo, what brings you here so late? We're investigating the incident. Dee... What makes you think they came this way? That's His Majesty's carriage. Don't touch it. Let's see what's inside it. Come on! Alright... - Step aside. - Sir! If the culprit wanted to escape from the palace... The South Corridor is the quickest way. My guess is... They needed you to cover their escape. So they "borrowed" your face and weapon. Impersonating you made the getaway possible. The carriage... makes a perfect hiding place. A hiding place? Theie Majesties often go outside the palace. Maybe they wanted to get something out of the palace. Her Majesty often leaves the palace. There's something in the carriage floor! See what it is! Quick. - Ding Xun... - Wait a moment. Watch for poison! - Huan Tian! - The Imperial Advisor! Advisor my foot! Soldier, think clearly! What happened to... the two magicians who died? Smoke Volant's bones were broken. And Ghost Night was burned alive. Two horrible deaths. We'll need to confirm that it was they who died. Huan Tian was dead when his body was hidden here. If they'd finished with him... why did they still need to hide him? I'm getting the impression that the culprits... ... were right in your midst. Suggesting that Huan Tian was to blame... ...was a way of misleading us. That means His Majesty... ...is still in danger! Why would they need to mislead us? Come on... The culprit was right next to the Emperor. But didn't assassinate him. So the Emperor was not the immediate target. It's too dangerous here in this palace! We must move His Majesty to safety. And the Empress? Dee, are you suggesting... ...there's a connection between her and the culprit? Are you alright? Dee, what's wrong with you? Faceless Lord! Are you there? I followed your advice. But the result was not as you said. What's your excuse for getting it all wrong? Be quiet, you ignorant shrew! The golden dragon moved. A good omen. You will eventually lead the nation. Enough of your complaints! My prediction will come true. Now it's your turn to keep a promise. Rehabilitate my name and family! Madam! Madam! Madam! Huang Shang... It's you Where is the Faceless Lord? Where are you, Faceless Lord? Madam! No one is there. You are talking to yourself. You lie! He was right in front of me. Faceless Lord! He was right here! I saw him just now! - Madam... - Faceless Lord! - The man locked in this dungeon... - The Faceless Lord! ...he died two years ago. The dungeon has been empty ever since. Faceless Lord, show yourself! Madam... Don't worry. I give you my promise. You will be protected. I will keep you safe from any danger. Why is Dee Renjie with you? You... Madam! Madam! Back to the palace, now! I suggest not, sir. The palace is not safe for you. Her Majesty's needs to be elsewhere for a time. We will prepare somewhere safer. SANZANG TEMPLE I'm Sha Tuo, from the Bureau of Investigations. I'm here to see Master Yuan Ce. It is good. But the Master is in seclusion, not receiving guests. I bring Master Sanzang's token. This area is a shrine. Utter no words beyond this point. How will I explain why I'm here? Misunderstandings will make things worse! All approaches come down to knowledge. Knowledge knows no boundary. I can tell what in your mind brings you here. Sorcerous possession has occurred in the nation. Dee Renjie sent you here. To see if I have the power to help you. Your Majesty, you handed the Dragon-Taming Mace to Dee. But what if he turned against us? Our nation will be helpness against him. Leng Yu's studio is laced with poisons. It's a trap! The Bureau must have a leader. For public safety, I take command of the Bureau. Master Sanzang used to chant that ancient Indian sutra. He was trying to counter its malign power. Now Master Sanzang has passed on. So the only way we can defeat the evil sorcery... is with the help of his disciple, Yuan Ce. Find Master Yuan Ce at Sanzang Temple. Ask him to help us. Yet again, the lust for power has malign consequences. Salvation lies in repentance. In all these conflicting feelings... ...I should not interfere. You should depart. BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONS - Master Dee, you're back. - Come over here. - Master Dee... - Master Dee... If you glimpse the Emperor, no need to greet him. Follow my orders and receive them here. - We need absolute secrecy. - Yes, sir. Your... Come this way. Dee! Was that ...? No hint that Their Majesties are here. Over here. What did Master Yuan Ce say? He's in seclusion... Won't come. But there's a letter, from a giant ape. Here it is. - What is that? - Sanskrit. This is the Daluo Longjie Sutra from India. Can this... help counter the sorcery? You were sick again? Dee, how powerful are the Wind Warriors? They fought whole armies to help found the dynasty. Our bureau can't compare with them. Without Yuan Ce's help... We may face defeat. Then we must find a way to enlist him. Hell is full of sufferers, so enlightenment must wait. Hell is full of sufferers, so enlightenment must wait. Hell is full of sufferers... So enlightenment must wait. Master Yuan Ce! Hell is full of sufferers, so enlightenment must wait. If I don't enter hell, who will? Report! The Empress has regained her sanity. Please give us your command. Our clansmen are gathering... to enact your orders! My Lord... The Emperor and Empress have left the palace. All seems normal in the palace. But the Bureau of Investigations is heavily guarded. Dee Renjie! What a buffon! It's too obvious. Well said! The riskiest place... is the safest place to hide! Dee Renjie is very devious. He seeks to protect the Emperor. So wherever Dee goes... ...we can be sure to find the Emperor. Just check that he's in the Bureau tonight. If he is, sneak inside... And kill the Emperor as soon as you find him! My Lord... Our final victory is at hand. Our thousands of disciples... ... will finally see the light! My Lord... When this weapon locks on to someone's head... ...it become immoveable. Dee, stay calm. You don't look well, you need more rest. Master Sanzang said... Hell is full of sufferers, so enlightenment must wait. That means... Fighting for justice in this demonic world... is more important than attaining enlightenment. Master Yuan Ce has great talents. But seclusion is not the way. It's been ten years. The path to Buddhahood... is actually to aid the suffering people. The Wind Warriors threaten us with disaster. Hell is at hand. This is the moment for him to intervene. I have to find him myself. You need more rest. - But who else can go? - In that case... I can recommend to you... There's one... One person. Someone who's very quick. And skilled at creating illusions. Someone who'd get the job done fast. This would be the woman assassin you've just saved? Umm. And she's going to help the Bureau? Water Moon, may I come in? No, I'm getting changed. It's an urgent matter. Let me come in. I'll keep my eyes closed. Last night something went missing from the Bureau. I assume you took it! What? You assume? Open your eyes! - You're fully dressed! - Who said I wasn't? Alright! Enter! Search the premises. Stop! What are you looking for? What went missing? You know very well. Officer Sha Tuo... Take her. I'm telling you... I've taken nothing. I realize you no longer take me as your friend. But I don't like being in debt to anyone. Next time you need me... I'll be there for you. And I'll always take you as a friend. Move! This was all my idea. No offense intended, please forgive us. Now I, Dee Renjie... On behalf of the Bureau... Officially request your assistance, Ma'am. Not my face! Not my face! Please come back to help us. This is the sutra sent by Master Yuan Ce. The Daluo Longjie Sutra. Now we will all... start to recite it. Be on guard! Prepare to fight! - Yes, sir! - Dee... You think the sutra really will help? Itt will help us to defend ourselves. To win, though, we'll need to be flexible. BUREAU OF INVESTIGATIONS I now realize... Just how powerful the Dragon-Taming Mace really is. Your nickname is "Huai Ying". May I call you Huai Ying? It's late and you need to rest. But I owe you so much. This is not appropriate, Your Majesty. Whatever it is, let's discuss it tomorrow. Forget protocol. Do you share my feelings? Impatient? Restless? I just learned... The Faceless Lord was a Wind Warrior. He gave himself up to save his people. He was detained as a hostage. But the Wind Warriors... were nonetheless slaughtered by the Emperor's army... ...without mercy. They were almost annihilated. Thirty years went by. But their hatred and resentment... ...found no end. Huai Ying... You are so intelligent. That's why I adore you. The night is long. I can't sleep. So I've come to pour out my love for you. In my opinion... Your Majesty is here for the Dragon-Taming Mace, right? And it's the real one this time! Whether it's real or fake... You can find out yourself. You won't strike me with it, will you? What's that? The anti-sorcery sutra! How dare you impersonate Her Majesty! The Iron Snow blade! I believe it was used to slice off the dragon's head. So the sound from the Mace counters the sorcery! Show me who you really are. Dee Renjie... You saw through my ruse. But I saw through your mind. You defended the Bureau. That means the Emperor is here. - Fire! - Bring water! The dynasty must fall! Get away! Ha ha ha... The dynasty must fall! The dynasty must fall! Can't see it? Where did it go? Hurry! Master... How can we fight that? This is our last stand! You think Water Moon has reached Sanzang Temple yet? SANZANG TEMPLLE Master Yuan Ce! Master Yuan Ce! Master Yuan Ce! Master Yuan Ce! Master Yuan Ce! Where are you? Damn it... The fog puts us at a disadvantage. Master Dee... I hear you've suffered a nervous affliction. Can it be cured? It comes from a demon in my mind. The first thing is to kill that demon. Is everything ready? As you commanded. What is that? Stay alert up there! Everyone on full alert! Be prepared. Be prepared. Release the net! Chant the sutra. (Daluo Longjie Sutra) I haven't chanted it yet! Who has the sutra with him? Thank you! (Daluo Longjie Sutra) The sutra is working! Who was caught up in that giant hand? Shu Huan! He's still there! Quick! Shu Huan, are you injured? Wake up! - Regroup! - Regroup! Rescue the wounded from the yard, quick! Protect the front line fighters, prepare to fight! Sir! Master, we can't hold the battlements! - Distract them! - Sir! Send the signal! You leave first! Quick! Master... Quick! Send the signal! Charge! Sorcery! Chant the sutra! Sir! Loose! The sorcery is tricking them! This is our last chance. Great! This is it... We have to take the risk. You casually hid the Mace here? Stop! Golden Guard! Stop! Stop! Everyone, stop! Those are our people! We've just beaten their sorcery! The back courtyard is ablaze! - The Emperor! - Protect him! Sir! - I'll go. - Move! Yi An! Defend Master Dee! Yes! You're trapped! The Emperor and Empress... ...were never here. Those who arrived here... ... in that imperial carriage... ... were not the imperial couple. We faked it! Ha ha ha... You tried to trick me? I have no time for tricks. Dee Renjie... The game between us... ... is over. Clan leader, the anger of hate has no end. A great man knows how to forgive. It's forgiveness that defines him as great. Why do you used your ancestors' hatred... to plunge the new world into chaos? We were victims of a power struggle. And you will be too! You're wrong. Our clash today... ...may not have the outcome you expect. Dee, you underestimate my powers. You really think your sutra... ...is stronger than my sorcery? - How is he doing that? - All his sorcery is trickery. Remember... Protect the Dragon-Taming Mace at all costs. Dee Renjie, see clearly what is happening. Don't torture yourself. Kill the unworthy Emperor! Golden Guard, be ready! Spread out! Now you're trapped! Do your worst! Dee! Master Dee! Sha Tuo! Master Dee! From the left! (Daluo Longjie Sutra) Alright? Yuchi! Take this! The Tang Dynasty must fall! Kill him! Out of my way! Come here! Looking for trouble? I'm back. You're not that badly hurt. If you'd been any later, I'd be gone! - Master Yuan Ce! - You can't stop this now. The hatred is endless. Once you release that demon... ... it is always with you. There is no escaping it. Too ridiculuous! You're trying to control my mind? This weapon was made to counter mind-control! Master! Master! It's a weapon from hell. Once it's locked in position, it can't be moved! Your soul now is trapped forever. Any last word before dying? Speak up! Ha ha ha... Life is infinitely precious. Why would we allow hatred to contaminate it? You will regret killing me. Fine words! But they won't stop you from dying! An inner demon urges killing. Expel it from our heart... ...and the weapon will fall open. An inner demon urges killing. Expel it from our heart... ...and the weapon will fall open. An inner demon urges killing. Expel it from our heart... ...and the weapon will fall open. The hatred is endless. With no space for regret. Expel the urge to kill, expel the demon. Hell is full of sufferers. So enlightenment can wait. I'm sorry I wasn't here earlier. Forgive me for being late. Please forgive me. And please receive my respect. Your Majesty, the Bureau's battle is over. Your Majesty can return to the palace. Valiant fighters, you have fought hard. Empress, we can return home. My mind was manipulated through sorcery. From now on, these sutras... ...will help to keep my mind clear. This statue of Guan Yin... resembles Your Majesty. It was crafted by a palace carpenter. The resemblance is coincidental. The Faceless Lord's ghost is still here. So the case is not yet closed. The Empress thinks she is a Bodhisattva. Her ambition to rule the nation is all too clear. From now on... The Mace, the Golden Guard, the Bureau... must all be ready. Another power struggles is coming! Twenty years later... A large statue of the goddess Guan Yin was installed in the city of Luoyang. One year after that... Empress Wu declared herself sole ruler and changed the dynastic name from "Tang" to "Zhou". Master Yuan Ce! Master Yuan Ce! Master Yuan Ce! It's the Wind Warriors. Where have you hidden Master Yuan Ce!? He isn't hidden. He told us to kneel here. So you actually are Master Yuan Ce!
