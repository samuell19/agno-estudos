Yes. I'm at the medicine shop. How much longer will you take? Okay. I've been waiting for ages! And now you're helping other people before me. Yeah... Yeah, I'll look into it. Ankita? Ankita! Ankita! Wait! Ankita! Ankita, I know why you're trying to escape. Stop! Ankita! Stop! Ankita! Stop! -Oh no! What happened? -Oh God! Is she dead? They say there are no such things as accidents. Everything is predestined. My elder sister used to say that accidents do happen... but what happens happens for the best. ROKTO ROHOSHYO It is 8:01AM and you're listening to your favourite morning show "Whatever you want!" When we were kids, we used to eagerly wait for one person's arrival. But we had to be asleep or he wouldn't come if we were awake! I'm talking about the one and only Santa Claus. What kind of goodies did he leave behind in all our stockings? Your host Swarnaja is here to talk about that and whatever you want. Whatever stories you have hidden within those stockings, share them with us! Our number is 2282 2282. Hello? Hello? Hi! I want to write a letter to God. What? How do I send a letter to God? A letter to God? How old are you? Hello? Hello? We got cut off. We'll try to reconnect. Till then, think about this, guys. How would you connect a letter to God with intimate memories of Christmas? On that note, here is an intimate song. Keep listening to 98.3 FM. Radio Mirchi listeners are always happy! In the cheeky winds You can hear the bees whispering You may hide But I know how to seek In the cheeky winds You can hear the bees whispering You may hide But I know how to seek What is it? What happened? He's become very naughty, ma'am. Running around and playing all day! He fell down again today. Ma'am, I think it's about time you registered Parag at the blood bank. He got away with minor scratches today... but if something worse happens tomorrow, it might get risky. -We won't find his blood type anywhere. -Oh no! Why don't you take his... blood sample and deposit it at the blood bank? That's better. Let's see the scratch. My hands are empty But the answer is precious My hands are empty But the answer is precious Is she too arrogant for wanting to know? Does she just want to play? Play all day? You may hide But I know how to seek Oh, the cheeky winds We take special care of our children and we make sure... Here they are! What's your name? Parag. His blood group is a bit rare. -And what's your name? -Mumu. Our favourite toys are forgotten Just to indulge the glint in her eyes Her very molecules Want to blossom into greatness You are unaware I light up the night with the fireflies Even iron can melt Due to a turbulent heart Even iron can melt Due to a turbulent heart But finding a true gem Can steal your slumber Hello? This is Mirchi Swarnaja. How can I send a letter to God? You hung up the previous day and you didn't give your contact details. Where are you calling from? Where do you stay? Home. Alright! And who else stays at your home? Mom, dad, grandpa, grandma? Have you shared your thoughts with anyone? Hey! Why are you on the phone? Huh? Come on! Now you'll be in trouble. Ma'am? Hosting a new show? My sister is an anchor at a radio station. Anchor is literally a type of grappling hook. So sad people around her get caught in that grappling hook and sis tries her best to help them. The embodiment of a welfare programme. No, nothing like that. Some kid has been calling the last few days. Something about writing a letter to God. So I asked your God to look out for him. -Here you go. -Thank you. -One plate eggs and toast. -Of course. You're talking as if that idol would have divine powers without your help! Enough of your nonsense! -Don't make light of others' beliefs. -When did I do that? But for all the welfare work she did... she didn't receive any recognition. Sometimes, people attributed it to good luck... and sometimes to God. When she first visited this shop six years ago the situation was completely different. Can I get some tea? Not available, ma'am. What? We don't have any tea. A tea stall with no tea? Why keep the stall open then? Why? Do I need to have tea just because my shop is open? Why are you talking to me like that? Actually, we don't have anything; tea, sugar, kerosene, biscuits, nothing. We don't get any customers... People urinate just beside the stall, so no one wants to come due to the stench. I wonder when God will spare us a glance. No, ma'am. No God can fix our situation. The municipality employees, sweepers and the like... They come here and pee. We don't get a single customer because of the stench. And if we don't get customers, how are we supposed to buy new stock? My sister's heart is just like instant noodles. It takes just two minutes to soften. It was the beginning of the month. The timing was perfect. Grandma was furious... and my mom was adding fuel to the fire! Typical know-it-all! Hey. These are all cream biscuits! This won't do... Oh my! Look at this! White oil! They don't even cook in white oil. She hasn't even got a job, and now she's worried about society! Bani, let it be! -They'll take whatever they need. -I'll arrange it all. Why didn't you ask me before buying all this? What do you think? Buying all this just once is enough? Will other customers donate like this every month? Hey! Give that back! Grandma's talk about donations gave Sis a brand new idea! What if God curses us? Has anything else helped your stall? Just do as I say. -Okay. -Let's see what your God can do. If He can't stop people urinating, what can He do? Ma'am, turn the idol this way. Just a bit more. A bit more. That's it! Perfect! That's perfect! I've heard of people who help the poor by... building houses, finding jobs and setting up shops for them. I've never heard of anyone making a temple for them. Only one person had to see it for Sis' plan to work. That's it! People came here to urinate and left without paying. Now they come to pray instead of urinating. How much do you have? -Ten thousand. -Adds up to 370 bucks. Really? Have you counted properly? That's 10, 370! Bless the Lord! What is he doing? I've seen him once before. He must have asked for a wish. Must have come true, so he's back. Look! He's about to make a donation! They want you to be an anchor? Yes! It's a new show. Starts next month. I'm the solo host. Hey! Will we get to hear you on the radio? At what time? Between eight and nine a.m. Oh! -Can you make me some noodles? -Sure. Not now! You have your blood donation now. Besides, we're out of noodles. Babai... why don't you get two packets of noodles from Madan's shop? Okay. I'll get it. Is she home? Yes. She's in her room. Sis, do you want a cushion to rest your arm on? No need. She's done. Okay. You can go. For Sis, donating blood had become routine. Ever since I came to this house... I remember seeing Doctor Uncle coming to take her blood every three months. Since her blood group was rare, she had to maintain her own blood bank. Doctor Uncle called it Golden Blood. But every time I saw it, I found no difference. It looked like normal blood. Like any of ours. Shonai... it's about time you started working out. Your blood pressure is quite low. I can work out here at home, Doctor Uncle. I don't need to go anywhere else. I've been hearing that for two years now. I've seen how much you work out. Huh! Doctor, tell her what to do. Don't worry about it. I'll arrange everything. Thanks! All you have to do is send her there. You arrange it first. I'll manage the rest. She thinks she can do whatever she wants! Let's go. I'll give you the address. "Whatever you want..." I've got it. What if I name my show 'Whatever you want'? How does that sound? Why that? The concept of my show is to share secrets. Say you have a secret which you haven't shared with anyone... and you suddenly want to... anonymously... Interesting! You can anonymously share it with everyone. It could be about happiness, sadness, anything! What about anger? If I'm angry about something, can I curse on air? Like calling someone son of a b***h? No! Anger... you can't really curse since it's a show... But anger... You can talk about anger. What would you talk about? Anger, happiness, sorrow... What would you share? What are you doing, Mom? I'm knitting a sweater, dear. Are you making it for me? Didn't I make one for you a few days ago? Who is it for then? My brother? How did you know that you've got a brother coming? Have a safe journey. I'll come over in the evening with Shonai. You all take care. -Stay safe. -Of course. When will you return, Mom? I'll be back soon. Till then... keep this with you. Keep it safe. I'll take it from you when I return. My sweetheart. Listen to Grandma. -Go safely. -Don't be naughty. Bye! Bye, Mom. -Something happened here! -Help her! She's still alive! (indistinct yelling) (chanting funeral hymns) Mom? You said you'd take this back. Why do people commit suicide? I don't know. When dreams are shattered... When there's nothing more to life... Maybe they get driven to it. Did your mom feel that way? Are you sure? Mom had changed after the miscarriage. No one thought she'd do something like that. Sometimes, I regret it. If I hadn't shown that sweater to Mom that day... She had knit it with great care. So many hopes... Dreams... So much faith... They seem to be more delicate than this wool. They fall apart so easily. Look at this photograph. This Doctor Uncle and me. Just after Mom passed away... I didn't speak a word all day. I just hugged this sweater tightly. Where is the sweater now? Shonai? Sis always liked to think she was very brave. She never let anyone see her sorrow. Since we heard so much about her blood being golden... we're sure she had a heart of gold too! Ever heard of someone... who sticks roses in the garbage bag first thing in the morning? And the reason behind it? To ward off the nasty smell for the sweeper! But problem is, the garbage picker might think someone is proposing to him! Don't cry, baby. Every single day, the woman sleeps through the entire ride... while Sis takes care of the baby to let the woman sleep. And it was known to everyone in her office that... no matter how overloaded the elevator was, it all came down to one person. Offload that one person, and the elevator would work smoothly. And she had accepted this fate so willingly that... she thought she was doing some great service to mankind. Very slowly, very slowly. Look in front, look in front. -Good morning, ma'am. -Good morning. -I'm Swarnaja. -Hello! Hello. Dr. Burman sent me. Oh, right! Why don't you change your clothes first? Now, let's hold this posture... and do some breathing exercises. Back straight, back straight. Okay, fine. First, breathe in. Deep breath. Now hold it. Till the count of five. One, two, three, four, five. Now, breathe out. Easy, easy there. We'll do a bit of stretching now, okay? Feet forward. Feet straight. Okay, fine. You can take my hand. Lean stretch far as you can. Close your eyes. Hands behind your back, please. Okay, that's fine. Relax. Take it slow. No rush at all. Okay, that's good. Let's change positions. Now... Look at me. That's great. This posture is the corpse pose. If you lie in this position... after an exercise session... all your muscles will feel so relaxed... that you'll think that you've stopped breathing. See how's he doing the Shavasana? Observe carefully. Doesn't it look like he's stopped breathing? Relax now. Continue. Continue in this pose. Just relax. Did you have any difficulty with Shavasana? Did you actually stop breathing? What? Why should I stop breathing? That's what it looked like. As if you stopped breathing completely. And the trainer also pointed it out to me. Oh. And were you watching... to see if I died from suffocation? -Are you okay? -Sorry. I'm fine. Sorry! I've never done yoga before this. My sole reference is the Aastha channel! Yoga is a way of life. All you need is practice. How long have you been doing it? I've been at it for about 12 years now. Twelve years? Seriously? Wow! No wonder! Want some lemonade? -Huh? -Lemonade? Calorie intake right after yoga? RIght now, our metabolism rate is as swift as a horse! In yoga, it is said that when the sun is overhead, even iron gets digested! Let's go. Did you start doing yoga to lose weight? No! It's because I have low blood pressure. Do you have any blood-related problems? You can try wearing a red gem on one hand. How did you know? I read your palm. You know palmistry? Not very well. Just the basics. My dad is a great palm reader. He learnt it in Kashi for seven years. Our family business is gemstones. I shifted to Kolkata a month ago. Magic and magicians. Two things children believe in greatly. But Sis' belief in astrology far outstrips them all! What really confused me was... how are things that aren't in our hands, written in our hands? Fate lines. Some can read them, some can't. And those who can, are able to fill people's minds with hopes. Did you know? Celestially, you're fated for a job in communication. What does 'celestially' mean? According to the cycle of fate. I think media is the right platform for you. You like doing social service too, right? And you will suffer setbacks for this. You'll also earn the love of the people. Why don't you try standing for the elections? Oh please. Let me see. Mercury's influence is strong upon you. -That mound is rising above the rest. -Which is the mound? This was enough to stir her curiosity about Astrology. As a result, it became quite annoying! What are you doing? Move your head! I can't see. Hey! Didn't Grandma say that your birth sign is Gemini? How will I know? There are automatic calculations going on here. Grandma! Grandma! What? My birth time 4:25 PM on a Monday, right? Yes. All these computer calculations... Are they accurate? Are you sure? Can't someone confirm this? Her smile told me that things were rolling in a different direction. Since then, her Astrology research shifted from her laptop to her phone inbox. And it didn't take long for her interest to shift from Astrology to the astrologer! WHAT'S YOUR SUNSIGN? AQUARIUS YOURS? My heart feels light Depression, out of sight I'm happy The sun's soft rays On my face for days and days I like it Even with feet stretched out The ground is elusive With my wings spread so wide These emotions make me want to fly away But my heart won't let me This love is calculated Where in history Has anyone won the other's heart? These calculations don't add up I'll call you a bit later. What are you doing? No more butter! -This is too much rice. -Just this much. Don't you know I'm on a diet? -What's wrong? -I don't like this. -Just give her whatever she wants. -How can I maintain my diet like this?? -Wait, I'll serve it. -Don't bother. I'll take it myself! There's no need to shout! A dearth of flowers in nature Makes the bees less hungry A shower of light A musical night The magic dissipates the darkness I'll be at peace I the light always guides you I know happy days are coming So here I am waiting I'll not leave Not until I live the best days of my life With my wings spread so wide These emotions make me want to fly away But my heart won't let me This love is calculated Where in history Has anyone won the other's heart? Dreams are the only currency With my wings spread so wide Hi! Hi. -Some coffee? -Coffe's good. Thank you. Where in history Has anyone won the other's heart? Dreams are the only currency What are you doing out in the dark here? Can I ask you a question? If it's about Astrology, I can't help you. Consult an astrologer for that. It's not about Astrology! Sit down. Say... Say two people have fallen in love... But neither can say it out loud. If the girl proposes first, won't it look very desperate? You're still stuck in your ancient Astrology world! In these modern times, no one cares who proposes first. In the Chandtala case, it was the wife who filed for divorce. And you're telling me you can't propose first? Please stop here. Thank you. -Bye. -Bye. Shammo... I think it's best if I tell you something... Tell me. I've started having feelings for you. Won't you say anything? You're really quiet. You can take your time, of course. Hello? Where are you? When are you returning? I'm on my way. Driving. Alright. Swarnaja. I feel like kicking myself for telling Sis about modern times and all. If she'd waited a bit, she'd have found out about the astrologer's wife. Anyone else would've brought the sky down on his head by now! But after a few days of silence, she gave him a piece of her mind! Don't bother me, Shammo. I know you intentionally avoided mentioning your wife. No... And that was the reason you avoided clicking photos with me. Anyway, I'll stay away from you, yoga and your stupid Astrology! But I wasn't very unhappy with the way things turned out. Honestly, what happened, happened for the best. Sis finally thought 'Enough is enough'! The baby cries while the mother sleeps. This can't go on anymore! Time is precious for all. Being good-natured isn't a sign of stupidity. First come, first serve. It's as simple as that! Get off! What are you looking at? Even the gods weren't spared. If the devotee is disgruntled, the value of devotion drops. But the biggest and most economic change that happened... was that she stopped spending on making garbage bags smell nicer. Hey! Aren't you going for yoga class? What about yoga class? You're just lying around! -No. -Why? Mom! What a rascal he is! -Who? -The garbage collector. I didn't like the look of him the past few days. Today he asked me why I didn't leave flowers out for him as usual. The nerve of him! Hello? Hello? Am I speaking to Swarnaja? Yes. Who is this? My name is Kheya. I'm Shammo's wife. I know you're a very busy person... But will it be possible to meet once? Meet me? Why? I'll tell you when we meet? Where? Will it be too much to ask you to come to my house? Sorry, but I can't. Alright, alright! Somewhere outside. Wherever you want. Who is it? Thanks. Anything else, ma'am? I'm so sorry! I've kept you waiting for so long. -Actually, my driver is... -No, it's okay. Can I have a word with you... in private? It's okay. You can speak freely in front of him. Okay. I heard what you told Shammo over the phone that day. The phone was on speaker. Sis. The washroom? Look, it's best if we clear up some things before starting. For formality's sake. No! What you said was absolutely correct! Absolutely correct! I'd have done the same! But I still think... you're making a mistake, Swarnaja. You're misunderstanding Shammo. Please don't misunderstand him. I don't think I misunderstood him. We girls tend to understand... That's what I'm saying! I'm saying that as a woman. Since that day, Shammo has refused to go to yoga class at all! When you two would chat about Astrology... late into the night... I told him to go out with you. I wanted to ease the tension. What was I to do? Thanks to me, he can't go anywhere. Just home, office and work. Every single day! Who likes that? He's my husband. I know him inside and out. Please don't misunderstand him. I've heard your show. I follow it regularly! You say whatever is on your mind, whether on the radio or over the phone. Did you recently have a leg operation? Nope. This is permanent. I'll go to heaven in this wheelchair! Why? What happened to you? I met with an accident 10 years ago... My pelvic region was shattered. Since then, I've been traveling the world in this chair. I don't want to brag, but I can cook very well! I can also do herbal facials. And I can sing quite well too. So, I know exactly how to dispel the anger of a beautiful woman. So, what'll you have? I've never seen a wheelchair-bound person so bright and happy before. I knew in my mind... that my sister's attempts to become tougher would soon soften just as quickly! The friendship with the astrologer's wife grew from coffee shop to social media. The family had something to say about that also. Now you're chatting with that guy's wife? This is too much, Shonai. Swarnaja, listen to me... Your rival can never be your friend for long. Sis didn't heed their words, of course. But through the jokes and laughter, she discovered something... There is a void in the astrologer's family. Kheya looks cheerful on the outside but there's darkness inside. What happened? Let's see. It looks fantastic! Lock the wheel. Thanks. Oh! I'm so excited! (indistinct chatter) Hi. It's very late. I'll come again. Shall I keep it here? See you. Bye! Wow. Did the girl make this at home? Grandma, 'the girl' has a name. It's Kheya. Very strong-willed, I must say. You know? This is even better than the stuff you buy from the market. Kolkata traffic is moving smoothly... except for the Park Street area, where the Christmas cheer is still on. Make sure to leave with time in hand if you take that route because if you get stuck, you'll remember my warnings! And we have our next caller! Hello? Hello? Hi! Where are you calling from? I've got a "whatever I want" type of story. Can I say it? Of course you can! But first, where you calling from? I'm calling from Uluberia. My name is Sajal Maity. Okay Sajal, tell me whatever story you want to. My friend and I were completely drunk! And I was getting calls and texts from an unknown number. So I called back and it was a girl! We both kept flirting with each other. Next day, I found out it was my girlfriend, calling from her father's phone! What then? Breakup? No, we didn't break up. But she blocked me for a month! She was in tears and threatened to commit suicide! And then? She didn't commit suicide, but she blocked me everywhere for a month! Thank you, Sajal! Thank you so much! Sajal is lucky his girlfriend got back with him even after a month. If you also have stories like this, please share them with us! You know our number. For now, here's a breakup song. Hello? What happened? Sorry to disturb you but it's an emergency. The Doctor Uncle you talked about, can I get his number? It's a bit personal. I don't know anyone here. Why? What happened? Last night, Kheya overdosed on sleeping pills... What? Kheya attempted suicide with sleeping pills last night. Can you please give me your doctor's number? I'll send it right now! I'll come over as soon as office gets over, okay? DOCTOR UNCLE Doctor Uncle, how is she? She had taken 10-12 pills last night. I've given her an injection. She's sleeping now. Does she need to be hospitalised? We have to wait for 24 hours either way. I've told him to keep an eye on her. Let's see. Won't you come inside? I haven't told you this but... After a lot of fighting and searching... I'd arranged a surrogate mother for Kheya. Maybe you don't know this... but Kheya can never give birth. Ten years ago... her uterus had to be removed due to an accident. I offered a woman money in return for this. Last evening, she called and said she was already pregnant. She's carrying her own child. Kheya became depressed upon hearing this. I should go. What's this? What's what? The red sweater. Oh! Kheya knitted it. She knitted many more. All for her child. One for each day of the week! I'm leaving. How could you take such a huge decision by yourself? I'm going to leave the house, Shonai! Your mother too did as she wished, and now she's gone and left me alone! At least you have to think about me. Swarnaja, listen... Please don't do this! Think about your future husband... the father of your child. Think about how he will feel. How can you think about bearing someone else's child? -Please listen to me! -Uff! Yes, it's a noble thought. -Thank you. -But you just joined work. It hasn't even been a year. You have to think about what you aspire to be. A surrogate mother? Or an RJ at India's number one radio station? Out of the question! How dare you? How could you even think it? Don't you know your own problems? Hey! Are you messing around with me? Doctor Uncle, won't I ever be a mother? Those with golden blood... Can they never become mothers? We'll find out when you decide to have your own child. I won't let you take this life risk for a person you barely know. I can't! This is not a salary incentive that you just hand out to anyone you like. It's a matter of the rarest blood. Do you know the meaning of surrogacy? You're renting out your womb. You'll be a mother for only 9 months. After that, they'll take the child away. And what will you have? Life risk. You might live, you might die. No way! This is the problem with you all, Doctor Uncle. You'll preach to the young, but never practice what you preach. It's always better if your neighbour is the martyr. I'm golden blooded... but I'll still be a surrogate mother. Shonai. Shonai! She started dreaming once again. What people didn't understand is that Sis wanted to do this for herself. Dreams aren't as delicate as the wool of a sweater. She wanted to prove this to herself. As her belly grew bigger, our family had to come to terms with it. But those who were unsupportive of her decision before... completely changed their tune now! Yes. The neighbourhood people are saying... that my granddaughter is made of steel! She's a responsible girl. That she is. You needlessly worry for her. Not everyone has such a big heart. Not to mention her courage. Of course! I say that all girls should learn from this. There's no need to be terrified. Terrified of society, in-laws and even your own parents! Swarnaja has taught them all a lesson! Rubbed it in all their faces! Her life... this journey she's on... would make for very interesting content. -Let's go for it. -Yes, but what about the budget? That's all well and good... but what if there's controversy? What if someone badmouths us? -Are we ready to handle that? -Surrogacy itself is interesting concept. -I understand that... -And a Mirchi RJ is going through it. A Mirchi RJ is becoming a surrogate mother! That itself is interesting content! That's why I'm saying. -And you're sure about that? -Absolutely. The Queen said, "Dear child, I have everything there. I have seven palaces... seven hundred servants... seven vaults full of jewels... seven gardens... And in one of those seven palaces, lived the king's youngest queen. My only... Hey! Are you listening? And soon, that day arrived. Everyone was at the same place... but nobody was talking. Everyone has questions in their mind. They want to ask. They even look at one another but they can't ask them. And like shy newlyweds, they lower their gaze. (indistinct chatter) (kids playing) God bless her! Congratulations, ma'am. You've given birth to a beautiful baby boy. He looks adorable in that sweater. It's as if it was made for him. What will you do from tomorrow? I'll go back to my old life. I'll join office again instead of wasting a whole month. Won't you feel sad? After two months, you must know his moods and habits by heart. Eleven months... nine months inside, two months outside. Will he never find out that you're his actual mother? What's the situation here? I'm just spending my last day with this little rascal! Let me check your blood pressure. It's time to look after yourself now. Don't get too attached to the kid. Let him get accustomed to his legal mother. Where is he? Let's see him! -Let's see! -He just woke up. Oh my! That sweater is lovely! Is it hand-knitted? Shonai... I'll see you later. Take care of yourself. Can you come over tomorrow? Tomorrow? Why? Since the little one is leaving... I thought we could have a nice parting meal together. I can't. I've got a lot of work tomorrow, so it'll be difficult. You... go ahead without me. You see me almost every day. See you. Hey, have a taste and see how it is. What is it? -Rice pudding? -Here you go. What rice is this, Auntie? Tulaipanji? Yes. But how did you know? I grew up eating this rice! Why did you make pudding? For the little one. Since he's leaving tomorrow. Tomorrow is an auspicious day. It is the Kalpataru Festival. Mom, the vegetables look done. Should I stir them up a bit? Yes. Go on, I'll be with you. -You want some more? -No, thank you. Maybe later. You could have stayed back a few more days. Shammo is under a lot of pressure during shifting. If I can't at least help out with the cooking... Did you hear, little one? Your mother loves your father more than you! I'm speaking from my heart... I'm indebted to you for what you've done for us. I can never repay this debt. Come on. It was the most humane thing to do. You are unnecessarily pessimistic about this world. To mask our sadness at the little one's departure... we ate and made merry that night. We were trying to convince each other... that they felt no sadness at this. Careful... Can I... What is it? Okay, alright. Relax. Calm down. What happened? Why is he crying? Is he hungry? No, he can't be. I just fed him a while back. -Wait. Let me. -Careful... Hey there, little one. Grandma! Grandma! Bani! -What happened? -Have they left? They didn't say anything! I don't know. I was asleep. I don't see their bags or anything! They were supposed to eat before leaving... What happened? What is it? Have they left? I can't see their bags anywhere! Call them. -Maybe there was some emergency. -Yes, hurry. Hello? Why did you leave all of a sudden? Without saying anything? Uh, yeah... You were sleeping, so I didn't want to wake you. After what happened last night, today's goodbye would have been... very painful for you. And besides, after an incident last night... Kheya is in low spirits right now. Please don't misunderstand me. I know you're feeling sad, but what was I to do? Hello? Hello? Lonely are the tunes From this monochord In the raw light of day All they are looking for In a drunken haze Is the touch of rain Those difficult calculations They were my doom What more can I ask for? Will these signs give me the proof I need? While I try to fan away The encroaching darkness? If you can Then teach me how to love Bless me with wings So that I may fly again For every cloud has a silver linings We can make delicate paper boats But we can also break hearts What more can I ask for? I don't think you'll want to wait any more (cheering) The darkness in my mind Seems to have lessened If you can Then teach me to love that In my garden A horrible tune hangs on my lips Disturbing your sleep like an alarm ring Let the soft light remain Within my breast I'll paint your playful face In water colours I'll paint your playful face In water colours I'll paint your playful face In water colours -Oh no! What happened? -Oh God! Is she dead? (indistinct yelling) Hello? This is Mirchi Swarnaja. How can I send a letter to God? You hung up the previous day, and you didn't leave us your contact details. Where are you calling from? Where do you stay? Home. Alright! And who else stays at your home? Mom, dad, grandpa, grandma? Have you shared your thoughts with anyone? Hey! Why are you on the phone? Huh? Come on! Now you'll be in trouble. Preliminary reports suggest that road visibility was low due to heavy rains. Local police officer, S. Chowdhury said that the accident happened on Wednesday night But the police got to know about it on Thursday morning. The local residents were the first responders on the scene. The plug point in my room has been dead three days now! No one bothers to fix it. Can't you see we're watching the news? And you're talking-- can't help it. I'm getting late for work. Yesterday morning, on the Eastern Bypass near Mukundapur a truck ran into and killed a pedestrian. The victim, a woman, was taken from the site to a private hospital where she was pronounced dead. Eyewitnesses say the victim was running from another woman, Seema Parwal. After questioning her, the police revealed the victim's name to be Ankita Sen. The police investigation department has disclosed that Ankita and her missing husband are known child smugglers. For the last 10 years, they have been... Isn't that Kheya? ...involved with child smuggling. Two years ago, Seema Parwal had legally agreed... to be a surrogate mother for Ankita and her husband. To combat this atrocity, the government has been urged to form a committee by several child welfare and rights groups. We'll we back after a short break. Let's ask him. Stay calm. How can I file a complaint? Not now. You'll have to wait. Let's go sit. Why? What are you doing? Listen, I work in the media... What's wrong? My child is missing. Since when? It's been five years now. What have you been doing for so long? Waiting? The child will grow up... Return to you... And it'll be all over the media? Result of a teenage pregnancy? -How dare you? You can't talk... -Buzz off. Go and wait! Kid's been missing five years, and now she comes to report it! -I'll make the entry when I have time. -Come this way. -What are you... -Hey! Stop! Hey! Wait! Stop! Hey! Go out! Sorry, Sir. I've been telling you to wait! You can't go barging in. This isn't your house. Get out of here! Let's go. Tell me... What is the problem? Do you know anything about this? Yes. I saw in the afternoon news. They're saying it's an international racket. How are you related to this? Five years ago, I became a surrogate mother to their baby. He had a sharper jawline... He had less than shoulder length hair... -Sharper nose... -His eyes were narrower... This looks more like him... The two numbers you gave me are registered under different names. Shammo and Kheya Sengupta don't exist. And Ms. Parwal... who chased Kheya before her accident, gave the police a different name. Do you have any other references with which we can track him? Yes. When I saw it on TV, I was really scared. The news mentioned a different name, but you're saying her name was Kheya? What name did they give you? The names they gave me were... Sayani Biswas and... Pradyut Biswas. From Bombay. You see, I don't like to poke my nose into the affairs of my tenants. But the pair lived quite peacefully. I need information for a case from five years ago. Of course, sir. Please ask at next counter. I need to access an old case. Shammo and Kheya Sengupta. I wasn't here then, sir. I just joined recently. Go and find me the case data files. Fast! -Sir, can you please give me a few minutes? -Immediately! We keep KYC documents. PAN card, Voter ID card and... the Adhaar card didn't exist back then. Ma'am, yours has your signature on it. Oh! This is the address of a rented house. The whole thing is a forgery. No, sir. I checked again. There's no one here by the name of Shammo Sengupta. The biggest news now is that Kolkata police is on to a child smuggling case. Wednesday evening, Ankita Sen AKA Kheya Sengupta died in a freak accident. That's when this racket was discovered. The detective department believes this is an international racket. The woman's husband, the mastermind of the racket, is currently missing. Whatever details Mrs. Parwal gave to the police about them... All these ID proofs... They're all fake. I can't even believe it! Their method is to pretend to be a couple and find a willing, surrogate mother. Then they'll use fake IDs and fake documents to obtain the child. And then sell the child to foreign companies for medical experimentation. Medical experiments as in? Like rats and guinea pigs are experimented on. In the case of expensive medicines and drugs... testing is done on human subjects. It's fine if the subject is an adult. They can give their consent... sign a bond, obviously against monetary compensation. But if the subject is a child... kidnap is the only option. If it boils down to kidnapping, then why surrogacy? If it's a kidnapping, there will be police investigation. But surrogacy means the child is their own, so no need for an investigation. I don't want to know all that! I want my child back! At any cost! I will go to the court, media houses, whatever! -I'll find him with or without your help-- -Alright, listen. Please. Do you have any photos of him? No, Shammo want to take photos. There was one image of him on Kheya's Facebook profile. Now that's been deleted. Hey, Sis... didn't we take a group photo that last day on Grandma's phone? Oh my! Please give me your phone. -My phone? Why? -I need it! In my bedroom. Please come in, sir. -Hello. -Hello. His face is away from the camera. Hello, sir? A report just came in. A child. Between four and five years old. The same blood group. The same! This means... he's still alive! Okay, sir! A person without any photographs... numerous IDs, of which all are fake. How do we trace him in a country of 1.1 billion people? If he's still in the country, that is! What about the child? Should I just forget about him like it's a bad dream? What happened? Eat up. Auntie, I can't eat so much! We're not supposed to eat like this on duty. Just eat! It's so late. Won't your wife be angry? No, she won't... since I'm not married! What? You're still unmarried? Your mother must be there? Grandma! He's a police officer. Please stop! So? Don't mothers of police officers get angry? Well, your grandma is correct. My mother is quite hot-tempered! See? Give him some water. Remember I had that stuff on my face back at the station? My mother told me to. Mother is looking to get me married. And nowadays, girls want fair husbands. Kheya used to do a lovely facial. She did a facial for me too. She gave me a face pack, which I've never used. Wait! A-C-X-A... Acxa. A Kerala-based brand. I don't know if it'll help. Still, if you can glean any clue from it... This language is as good as Hebrew to me. Give me two days. I'll try and figure this out. I'm keeping this. What do you think? Will that officer be able to help? What you are trying to chase is not going to be easily caught. What am I to do, Grandma? You haven't let me do anything I wanted to since I was little. You didn't even let me go out and play. What have you got against me trying to save an innocent life? We were all beside you in your struggle. What's the point of going back to this after five long years? Besides, this is a huge racket. They said it on the news. These are dangerous people. Your mother left me... of her own free will. Now what if something happens to you? You're only thinking about yourself. Have you thought about how I feel? Even Mom didn't think about me. She left me too. But I won't do that. I know... I know that my little one is out there. And I will find him. (indistinct chatter) Yes, I'm here. Which floor? Okay. I heard a rustling noise. At first, I thought it was probably a cat. I went towards the kitchen. when I was crossing my sister's room, I had a feeling that... that a man was standing there. I ran up behind him and grabbed him but before I could shout for help... he covered my mouth. His face was covered. He was very strong. Even with both hands, I couldn't stop him. Did you notice anything about him? He wore a chain around his neck. It was golden. And... he had a tattoo on his hand. -A tattoo? -Yes. It was... Right here... A tattoo of the sun. Hello, sir? Yes? We've caught someone! Okay. He's at the station. Please come quickly! Okay, I'll be right over. Someone matching the sketch you gave us has been caught. You'll have to come with me to identify him. Look. I don't know anything, sir! Did Shammo have any tattoos on his hand? He could've had it done later, of course. Come on. Let's have lunch. I'm not hungry. You haven't eaten since dinner last night... I told you I'm not hungry! Alright, fine. I'll leave 2 spoonfuls for you and eat the rest, okay? I don't eat so late. Thank you. Just try it! This is tulaipanji rice! From my ancestral home. You won't get this stuff here. What rice is this, Auntie? Tulaipanji? Yes. But how did you know? I grew up eating this rice! Where do you live? Raigunj. Kheya said that she grew up eating this rice. Is this rice available everywhere? It could be available in many places nowadays... but there is a sense of pride in saying she grew up eating it. Only people from Raigunj would say something like that. Sis! Sis! Please take me with you! Nothing will happen to me! Take me with you, please! Out of the question! Look at me! I'm completely fine now! Mom, tell her! Swarnaja, please take him along with you. Exactly! And if he goes with you, we'll feel at ease here. Mom, why don't you tell her? If he wasn't fine, the doctors wouldn't have discharged him. Take him with you. And besides, you'll have a police officer with you. Since everyone's insisting, take him along. There won't be any problem. (song playing) Is Rabeya Khatoon your daughter? Is this her? CHILD SMUGGLING RACKET Let's go in. How long was she married? Ten years. Eloped? Yes. Why did she return after so many years? Rabeya! What happened to Sushil's leg? Let's take him inside! Easy, take it easy! Without a doctor's help, you can't get the bullet out, Rabeya. Should I call Sunil? He'll come over immediately. We can't tell anyone, Mom! Get me some more clean, hot water. Then, three months later, they left. Did Shammo's leg heal by that time? She's talking about Sushil. No. The wound was getting worse. Why? Didn't he get it treated? No. Sushil stayed away from allopathic medicines. He used to say... that all pharma companies put dangerous chemicals in their products. He used to take some pills... Some imported medicine. That kind of worked. But it didn't fully heal. Which room? What? Which room did your son-in-law occupy? Inside. A-C-X-A... Acxa! This looks like the imported medicine. They seem to have had a lot of faith in this ayurvedic company. This means... They've been using products from this company for quite a while. We need to track this company's client list. We've picked her up. Yeah. They're putting her in the car. Yes, a policewoman's with her. I'll call before I enter Kolkata. Keep an eye on your phone. Sis! Who's firing? There! Someone's there! Do you want to eat? Yeah, eggs and toast. Here. Boiled eggs for me. Hey! You haven't even had your tea. Do you want to have something else? How much longer? Almost done. Oh. What happened? What else? Bad road conditions... Broken glass littering the place! Tell me about it! Hey! What the... Hey you! What the hell? Watch it! Do they think it's a playground? Why don't you tell them anything? This isn't a playground! ATHITHI HOTEL Where are you off to? Does she play any sports? No, I don't think so... Come on! Kick it here! Come on! Kick it here! Miss! Kick it here! Kick it! I'm so sorry, dear! I didn't realise... Where does it hurt? Show me. Alright, now stretch forward slowly. That's fine. See there? See how's he doing the Shavasana? Observe carefully. Doesn't it look like he's stopped breathing? Here. Stop here. Let me see. Hey... Hey! Hey! Get him! After him! Stop! Hey! Stop! Get him! Wait...stop. Stop, dude. Stop! Yes, where are you? The rail line? I'm right there. Saw him! Hey! Wait! Stop! Stay right there! Don't move! If I go there, there'll be trouble! You lot! Get him! Get him! Grab the rascal! Got you! There he is. Ready to leave. This is Mr. and Mrs. Choudhury. Say hello. Hello, Parag. What were you doing? Playing? Come. Come here. Do you like to play? -Huh? -Hmm. Do you play video games? Car racing? Or football? Have you played FIFA? FIFA? You'll have a team... I'll have a team... You can choose your own players... and I can choose my own players. Then I'll run past the mid-field... slip in through the right wing... dodge the other players... and then... Goal! Up! Sir! Don't hit me, Sir! -Believe me! I don't know anything! -Up! Get up! You're not listening to a word I'm saying. Get up! Straight up! Come on! Get up! Tell me! Tell me what you know! -Sir! Please! -What is it? What did you say? Up! Start talking, a**hole! Sir! Listen to me! Please! What did you say? I can't hear you! What? Talk! Talk! Let's hear it! -I'm telling you! I don't know anything! -Talk! Talk! I'll tell you, sir! I'll tell you! I'll talk! I'll talk! How did you meet Sushil? I... didn't know anyone before... Sushil, Shammo, I had no... Lies again? I'm telling you the truth, sir! I didn't know anyone! He... he... He just told me to... show him to ma'am when she came. Who gave you these instructions? Who gave you these instructions?? Dr. Burman... I used to work with Dr. Burman. It's about time you started working out. Doctor, tell her what to do. Don't worry about it. I'll arrange everything. All you have to do is send her there. Dr. Burman sent me. Oh, right! Do you have any blood-related problems? Take care of yourself now. Don't get too attached... to the kid. Sir, we found these at his place. Doctor Uncle sold my most personal emotions. Kheya's suicide attempt was staged. I went to their house... saw the hand-knitted sweater... became emotional and agreed to it. A masterful plan. They've done this sort of thing before. Why did they suddenly target Swarnaja? They needed a child. But the child had to match her blood group. But Doctor Uncle told me our blood groups don't match! That was also a lie, ma'am. Who told you to introduce Shammo to ma'am? Dr. Burman? No, sir. The doctor and I... sold Swarnaja's blood samples abroad. This was our only crime. But one day... a foreign agent who deals with this operation... saw her blood report and wanted to meet the doctor. They just told us... that a Bengali couple would come to Kolkata. And that we had to make sure ma'am meets them. The Doctor didn't agree at first. But they threatened to kill him. They said they'd expose his secret blood trading business. So he finally agreed. But he clearly stated that... he'd call it off if she was harmed. Any harm... But what happened to the child? Even I don't know that, sir. That morning Kheya and Shammo were to leave... Swarnaja's house with the child. They were to hand him over to the doctor the same day. Those were the instructions. I was supposed to go with him as well. But... Sir suddenly told me not to come. Soon after that, I found out that... he's been murdered. Is it possible that Shammo has already sold the child? That Shammo committed the murder? -No, sir. -To frame Dr. Burman? No, sir. It's not possible because... Because Shammo is still looking for the child. It was on Shammo's instructions that I went to attack ma'am... The people who run this business from abroad... are putting immense pressure on Shammo. They even shot him in the leg once. If he can't find the child, Shammo's dead. All I know is... the child is worth a lot in the international market. There are... many big companies wanting to experiment with the child. And they've already placed large bids on him. That's all I know, sir. I swear! Be careful. Bye! Best of luck, Mr. Choudhury. Parag doesn't only have golden blood... he has a golden heart too. Do take care of him. -Sure, I will. -Okay. Take care of yourself. Be a good boy. Bye! Sis! Hey, don't cry! When you get the little one, keep him with you. The child is yours alone. His blood is yours. Nothing's happened to him. You'll find him. I know it! And maybe he's... waiting for you to find him. Since your blood is the same, you must be able to feel his suffering? No one but you can ever understand him. We're taking him to the police headquarters but I don't think he knows anything more. This is an international racket. We don't know who's working undercover for them. We don't know who has the child now... if they at all have him. Too many questions. And what if they don't have him yet? What if he's still alive? How will we trace him? -With blood. -What? If we share the same blood, and if he's still alive... his name will have been registered at the blood bank. Let's go. Do you have Rh Null blood groups there? Yes! A child. Around 4 years old. Where does he live? Give me the address. An orphanage? -Sir? -Okay. Here's the address. We've found him. They want to adopt Parag... for his blood group? Strange! It was for his blood group that no one wanted to adopt him. The answer is in your own question. They wanted to adopt him because his blood group is rare. Please cooperate with us and give us the relevant details. You have no idea what a big crime is about to be committed! Show me some legal papers and I'll certainly give you the details. This adoption case has the minister's recommendation, so I'm sorry. Can you at least tell us whether the father... had a problem with his leg? Yes... He was in a wheelchair. He recently had an opeartion in his leg. If you already know him... why are you asking me for details? Yes? Sir, the bottle you gave me is from a Kerala-based ayurvedic company. It is a medication for gangrene prevention. Okay. No side-effects. And each bottle contains 60 pills. Sixty? In the last three months, they've sent eight such parcels to Bengal. Eight? Yes, sir. One in North Bengal. One in Burdhwan and six in Kolkata. I see. The six that came to Kolkata... came in two different shipments from two different phone numbers. Go on. And both shipments went to the same shop. Which shop? A small grocery shop. Quickly locate that shop. Send a force there. And you go with them! Okay! Sir, I'll meet you at the airport. Okay. Bye, Parag. So, Parag? Hmm? Hey. There's a surprise for you. What is it? We're going abroad to buy you video games. Have you ever been on a plane before? No. We're going by plane. -Where is Aparna Choudhury? -I don't know, sir. -You don't know? -No, sir. -The junior artists who to this studio... -Yes? Their props are delivered here, and I keep them. And you don't know what gets delivered to you? How am I to know? What have I been saying? No point getting angry. I really don't know! -Where is she? -I don't know! -Take him in! -Let me go! (indistinct yelling) There! There's Aparna! There she is! Out of my way! Do you see that man? He's going to take a nice photo of you, okay? Sit still for him, alright? Smile please? Look here! Let's take a nice photo of you. Can I? No? Come on! Just one photo. Don't shake your head. Hold still. Does it hurt? Tell me, can I tighten it a bit more? Is it hurting? That's enough. S**t! Hey, start packing! What happened? Aparna has been caught! The police will be here any minute! This laptop, these papers... Pack everything. And don't forget my pills. S**t! I'll get the kid! You guys go that side. Quickly! I'll go around the back. -You! Come with me! -Yes, sir. Come on! Where are you taking me? Where are you taking me? Let me go. Putt me down! Where are we going? Let go of me! Babai? Shammo! Let him go! Where are you taking him? Shammo! Let him go! Let! Him! Go! Let him go, Shammo! -Shammo! Let him go! -Let him go! Let go of me. Get him! Get him! (indistinct chatter) Jump. Go on. Jump. F**k! Catch him! Let's not talk For the sake of talking Let's not talk For the sake of talking The weight of words is far too great The weight of words is far too great The weight of words Brings tears to the eye Let's not talk For the sake of talking Let's not talk For the sake of talking It's not easy to heal the heart You might lose more than that I am full of hurt And my life is in shambles Yet there might be Something to look forward to Let's not talk about all that Let's not talk For the sake of talking There is silence after words Like glass before it hits the ground I've held back tears Just to listen to your words As I opened my mouth to speak Someone in my mind Pulled at my heart strings Listen well We are but the bearer of words Let's talk a bit less now Let's not talk For the sake of talking The weight of words is far too great The weight of words is far too great The weight of words Brings tears to the eye Let's not talk For the sake of talking Let's not talk about what didn't happen Let's talk a bit less now Sis! The child is yours alone. His blood is yours. Nothing's happened to him. You'll find him. I know it! Since your blood is the same, you must be able to feel his suffering? No one but you can ever understand him. Shonai? Have some food at least? Oh, Grandma! I want to show you something. I had kept this with me. The man who came to me with Parag was a doctor. Parag was hardly two and a half months old then. He was wearing this then. Ma'am, some doctor wants to meet you. Please keep this child. He's in grave danger! Doctor? The doctor told me to take special care of Parag. And he also said... Keep him! I'll come and get him! Tonight he's in grave danger! Keep him! Just remember one thing. He has the rarest blood group. Don't let anyone know about it. -I'll come and get him! -But doctor-- Don't worry! I'll be back! He never came back. And four years have passed since then. Why did you inform the blood bank? What happened was... Parag fell down while playing on the swings. He had scratches all over. I started worrying. What if something worse happened? That's why I couldn't keep my promise to the doctor. But I later realised something. As soon as the information reached the blood bank... the racketeers picked up on it. And soon after... they became Mr. and Mrs. Choudhury and came to adopt Parag. But there's something I don't get. Who is this doctor? And why does he want to save Parag? Dr. Burman was our family physician. Ma'am? What is it? Parag doesn't want to come down. What? Tell him that I'm calling him here. -Yes, ma'am. -Ask him to come down. Just a second... Doesn't he want to go with me? -Does he know that I've come to get him? -No, no. I think he's a little scared. I'm ready to complete responsibility for him, of course. But I also don't want to force him to come with me. Alright. Why don't you try and talk to him yourself? Parag! Parag? Parag? Wait! Someone's come to meet you. She's waiting downstairs. Let's go meet her. Parag? Look who's come. Can you recognise her? Remember she went to hospital to see you? She donated her blood to you. Remember? What are you doing here, Parag? Won't you go out and play? I can take you out to play. Do you want to come? And if you don't feel like playing, then... do what your heart desires. Whatever you want! Parag! What are you doing? He's just a kid! Are you leaving? Are you talking to me, Parag? If I go with you, can I really do whatever I want? Yes, Parag. Really. Can I write a letter to God? Can I go out and play? You won't stop me? Why should I stop you? What if I get hurt and start bleeding? I'm here for you. There are no such things as accidents. What happens happens for the best. My elder used to say that accidents do happen... but not always for the worse. What more can I ask for? The light shines bright Even in darkness Like a swarm of fireflies Flying in a blaze The eyes burned bright with the light (song playing)
