Stop. I'll stop if you just explain it to me, - because I don't... - Would you please just drop it? All right, all right, fine, fine, fine, fine. Consider it dropped. It's dropped. - It's on the ground. - Good. But, I mean, come on, everybody loves birthdays. You got decorations. You got balloons. You got parties and cake. Look, I don't need presents, I don't want decorations, and I'm-I'm not a cake guy. Seriously, though, you don't like cake? Name one food better than cake. Guinea pig. Oh, again with the guinea pig. I bet if I blindfolded you, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a skunk and a guinea pig. Wrong. Snakes have impeccable taste buds. - I can taste air. - Air? Yes. Air. Mm. Nice. I don't know. They're a little, uh... a little cute for my taste. That's what makes them so delicious. You're not just eating food. You're eating pure goodness. It's not about the pig. It's about what it symbolizes on a deeper level. So, you can... you can taste air? What else you got? - Forget about it. - W-W-Wait. Can you also hear color? - Can you see sound? - All right, all right. Okay. 'Cause we should really be capitalizing on these skills. Okay, all right, fine. Get it all out. - Get it all out now. - Okay, okay. Look at that. 4:00 p.m. Now I know the exact moment our friendship died. - Let's bounce. - Yep. Tastes like, um, you're gonna stick me with the bill.. Again. Well, it is my birthday. So now you play the birthday card? That's interesting. Can we get a check, please, when you get a chance? Hello? Checkity-check-check. You know what? We're just gonna leave the money right here, okay? You know the one good thing about this place? - What? - We never have to wait for a table. Well, isn't that every place? Hey, man. How you been? I haven't seen you in... Snake attack! Oh. Mints. Sorry, folks. I'm switching him to decaf. All right. Let's do this. Guinea pig, huh? It's the Rolls-Royce of rodents. Yeah, but it's still a rodent. You know what I mean? Don't mind us, just robbing this place. Whoo! Yeah! - Go bad... - Or go home. Hey, you. Get over here. Little bit closer. Oh, I know what it is. You're afraid because I'm the... the Big Bad Wolf. Well, I'm not surprised. I am the villain in every story. Isn't that right, Mr. Snake? Yep. Say hello to Mr. Snake. Serpentine, safe-cracking machine. Imagine Houdini but with no arms. Kind of guy who'd tell you the glass is half empty, then steal it from you. He's also my best bud. And today's his birthday! - Not relevant. - He's a sweetheart. You're a sweetheart. Well, look who's here. Took 'em long enough. Watch this. Three. Two. One. And over here is Ms. Tarantula, our in-house hacker, our pocket search engine, our traveling tech wizard. We call her Webs. Very slick, Webs. I also took over the police dispatch, blurred their satellite imaging system, grounded their chopper. And one more thing. You didn't. I got a special delivery for... Ah! Ooh! Don't eat me! Please! Don't eat me! Happy birthday, Mr. Grumpy Pants. I think I hate you. Guys, it's me. I was the construction worker. And this is Mr. Shark, master of disguise, apex predator of a thousand faces. Stealing the Mona Lisa disguised as the Mona Lisa. Dig that. Watch it, big tuna. I'm trying to work here. Keep it cool, baby. Birthdays should be chill. And rounding out the crew... Surprise! ...is Mr. Piranha. He's a loose cannon with a short fuse, willing to scrap with anyone or anything. He's brave. He's fearless. Uh, who am I kidding? He's crazy. Santo cielo, that's a lot of po-po. Uh, Piranha, did we forget something? - What? - The present. - You know. - Oh, um... Of-of course I didn't forget. You know you fart when you lie, right? What? No, I fart when I'm nervous. Yeah. Nervous about lying. I'm sorry. Piranha! Don't breathe it in. I breathed it in! Yeah, they're a bit eccentric, but when you're born us, you don't exactly win many popularity contests. - Shark! - Shark! Do I wish people didn't see us as monsters? Eight legs, eight times the cardio. Monster! - Sure, I do. - What's up, papa? But these are the cards we've been dealt, so we might as well play 'em. Jackpot! Yes!

Spit it out! Spit it out! Never! Let's see what they're saying about us today. What up? It's Tiffany Fluffit, Channel 6 Action News. The Bad Guys have struck again... Guys, guys, stop it. We're on TV. - Ooh, ooh! - ...proving once more that they are the most diabolical criminals of our time. Ooh, "diabolical." That's new. Know what it sounds like? A cologne. Diabolical. To address this heinous crime spree is the newly elected governor, Diane Foxington. - Governor? - Okay. Yeah. I hear you. I hear you. Listen, listen. We all know how dastardly the Bad Guys are. - You bet we are. - But more than anything... I feel sorry for them. What? These so-called Bad Guys are really just second-rate has-beens. Behind their amateurish antics and, frankly, unoriginal capers.. I mean, really, another bank? Is nothing but a deep well of anger... I ain't angry! You're angry! - ...denial... - Not true. ...and self-loathing. The only one I self-loathe is you. And those are holes that no amount of cash or priceless art can ever fill. What's on the Food Network? So, can we just forget about... Who-who is she to judge us? ...and focus on more positive things? And what could be more positive than the Annual Good Samaritan Awards, where tomorrow night I will present the Golden Dolphin to this year's goodest citizen? I can't believe I voted for her. You voted for her? What? She's good on climate change. Wait. What's going on? You've got that twinkle in your eye. Guys, who's up for another job? A big one. The Golden Dolphin. - Seriously? - Oh. I thought I was the crazy one. That job has broken every criminal who's tried it. The Bucharest Bandits, Lucky Jim. The Crimson Paw. Actually, the Crimson Paw was never arrested. Yeah, but he never stole anything again. Snake, what better way to wipe that smirk off the governor's fuzzy face than stealing the Golden Dolphin from right under her whiskers? This is the Holy Grail of thievery. If we pull this off, we'll cement our legacy as the greatest criminals of all time. Whoa, whoa, buddy. I thought we weren't supposed to make things personal. Besides, we've got a good thing going here. Friends, freedom, and just look at this loot. All right, you're right. Forget it. - The Dolphin job is off. - Good. I guess the pig will get his trophy after all. Yeah, I guess he would... What do you mean, "pig"? Oh, yes, did I not mention that? That's weird. I thought I mentioned that it was, uh... The Good Samaritan is... A guinea pig? What do you say, Snakey? Better than cake. Right. Okay. Fine. But he better be delicious. Are we all in this together? ♪ ♪ So here's the plan. Like every year, the ceremony will be held at the Museum of Fine Arts, where the Golden Dolphin will be positioned just beyond the backstage curtain. Sounds easy. Sounds easy, hermano, but to get there, we'll need to bypass three levels of security. So, step one: We'll need to blend in. ♪ Baby, I'm howlin' for you ♪ ♪ Da-da da-da da, da-da da-da da... ♪ Professor Marmalade, this year's recipient of the Golden Dolphin, the most annoying good creature on the planet. Professor, in the past year, you've stopped wars, fed the hungry and saved countless pandas. Some have described your goodness as second only to Mother Teresa. Oh, Tiffany, it's not a competition. And if it were, it would really be more of a tie. But we can all agree that there is a flower of goodness inside all of us, just waiting to blossom. Once inside, there are two armored doors. The first can only be opened by a special key card that is carried by our dear friend, the chief of police. The second is outfitted with a retinal scanner and guarded by an elite special ops unit trained to strike first and ask questions later. Governor Foxington is the only one who has clearance to open the second door. So, step two: She and I will need to get up close and personal. Enjoy your evening, Mr. Ambassador. Thank you, ma'am. Interesting piece. Trashy, pointless and pretentious. Hmm. They say that art reveals more about the viewer than the artist. Mister... Poodleton. Oliver Poodleton. Uh... okay. It's about time someone stood up to those diabolical Bad Guys. Though, I've got to say, no one's succeeded yet. Eh. I don't think it'll be that hard. I have a feeling it'll be harder than you think. I'd say they're one epic job away from cementing their legacy. Mr. Poodleton, you're-you're funny. I am? The only legacy they're cementing is life in prison. Did you see their last job? Ugh. Unsecured exits, crude disguises, compulsive showboating. I mean, it was a mess. All the classic signs of a crew in decline. Next, they're gonna make it personal. That's when you know they're toast. Uh, well, that's your opinion. It is, and I'm the governor. As for the sculpture, I think it's about perspective. If you look closely enough, even trash can be recycled into something beautiful. How about that? I guess some things aren't always as they appear. That reminds me. May I? I can't miss a photo op with the governor and a pile of garbage. Oh, Mr. Poodleton, you're too hard on yourself. Hey... Okay, friends. It's showtime. Once we're in, it's on to step three: We split up and we take our positions. Officers, if the Bad Guys crash this event, I am definitely going to lose my job, and I will not hesitate to take you down with me. - Now, move out. - Yes, ma'am!

No, thank you. My life is too complicated right now. Uh, uh... Boys, it's Dolphin season. Copy that. I'm on the move. Unit two, is the backstage area still secure? Unit two. All clear. This is where all the training pays off. Oh, pardon me. - Terribly sorry. - Not a problem, sir. Keep your eyes open, boys. They could be anywhere, just waiting to humiliate us. Wolf is in position. Piranha, you all penguin-suited and booted? Affirmative. I'm a clean, mean, Dolphin-stealing machine. What's going on, guys? - Here, let me help you. - Ooh. Are you okay, ma'am? Oh, my gracious, yes. I may be dizzy, but I'm alive, thanks to you. - What are you... - Oh. Mm. Thank you, dear. You're such a good boy. All good, brother? Yeah, all... a-all good. Yeah, yeah. Um...

Oops, I forgot, I'm not pregnant. ...president of the committee, Governor Diane Foxington. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Last year, we faced our biggest test when a meteorite crashed into our dear city. That meteorite didn't just make a hole in our city. It made a hole in our hearts. Aw. But even in tragedy, Professor Marmalade, he did what he does so well. He made us look at things differently. And thanks to you, Marmalade, the Love Crater Meteorite will forever serve as a symbol of how there is good even in the worst places. Whoo! Hurry up. ...and successfully reversed climate change for the well-being of all of us. This is going surprisingly smoothly. What the molt is that?

Whoa! Excuse me. Is this the ladies' room? Oh, uh, y-you need to take a right at the end of the hall, ma'am. Yes. Whoop-bam! Oh, come on! And now it is my honor to award Professor Marmalade with the Golden Dolphin! - No. - No. Yes! I mean, yes! What? Everyone, everyone, uh, please don't panic. Just stay calm. I'm-I'm sure there's an explanation for this. I repeat, uh, please do not panic. Nice work, everybody. Now, let's make like a wolf and get the pack out of here. Ah, wordplay. I don't get it. Diane, Diane, if I may... You have to understand, I didn't bring hope back to the city for an award. I did these good things because of how they made me feel. That tingly feeling I get. That shiver up my spine. The wag in my tiny tail. Because, you see, being good just feels so good. And when you're good, you're loved. Wolf? - Wolf? - What are you doing?

That, too. - Narcissism. - Yeah. Yeah. Emotional emptiness. - So we're on the same page. - Hmm. What is he doing? Sadly, we were never given a chance to be anything more than second-rate criminals. If only there was someone who could help the flower of goodness inside us blossom. Some icon of love and forgiveness, like, uh, I don't know, Mother Teresa. Best thing is to just throw us in jail for the rest of our hopeless lives. Yeah, that's the plan. Wait, wait, wait, no, no. - Get in there. - Ow! Wait. Uh, beg... beg pardon? Mr. Wolf may be a savage beast. Basically walking garbage. Sorry, I'm making a point. Do what you need to do, pal. But how can we say they're hopeless if they've never been given a chance? What if... what if we tried a little experiment, Diane? As you know, my Gala for Goodness, the "hashtag charity event of the year," is coming up. If I can prove to everyone at that gala that the Bad Guys have changed, will you set them free and give them a clean start? - What? Professor Marmalade! - Ow! No, no, no, no, no. Don't you see what he's doing? He's playing you. But it was my idea. It was his idea. But only because you made him have it. Madam Governor, you can't just let them go. Professor, I'm not about to put the safety of the city on the line for an experiment. Excuse me, Madam Governor. I seem to remember that a wise person once said, "Even trash can be recycled into something beautiful." Okay. I'm game. But only because it's you, Professor. No! We'll hold on to the Dolphin until the gala. Just to remove any unnecessary temptation. Of course. Good thinking. That's why you're governor. Now that everyone's happy... Not happy. ...I, Rupert Marmalade the Fourth, will turn the Bad Guys into... the Good Guys! I think these belong to you. Hey. Not everyone gets a second chance. Make the most of it, Mr. Poodleton.

The world loving us instead of being scared of us? You ever... you ever think about that? Loving us? Yeah, right. I don't waste time thinking about stuff that's never gonna happen. I can't wait for things to get back to normal. Yeah. Back to normal, back to normal. What up? We are just moments away from Professor Marmalade's Gala for Goodness, where the legendary Love Crater Meteorite will be on display for the first time ever. But what everyone is really buzzing about is the Bad Guys, whose heart-melting rescue video has made them an overnight viral sensation. All right, guys, this is the big one. The Golden Dolphin is inside a titanium case controlled by a randomly generated five-digit code, a code kept safe and secure inside a briefcase handcuffed to the chief of police. She's not messing around. The code is only accessible with - her authorized fingerprints. - Leave that to me. While Snake gets the code, Shark will secure the fake Dolphin. I like the sound of that. Meanwhile, the rest of us plant circuit jammers. Allowing me to hack into the power grid. At the end of the night, we toast the professor, "Blah-blah-blah, yada yada," and when I say "Marmalade," lights go out, and we'll have exactly four seconds to make our move. The old switcheroo. Chief hands Marmalade the fake Dolphin, we get our pardon, applause, applause, exit stage right, and by the time they realize what happened... So long, suckers! ...we'll be driving off into the sunset, legacy cemented. Nice. Got to hand it to you, buddy. You're a real artist. Well, Good Guys, this is it. Good luck out there. Remember, all eyes will be on you tonight, not me. Friends, meet the Good Guys! Uh, this is different. - Is this a prank? - What's that sound? Like screaming but not terrified.

Our brilliant mentor, - a paragon of enlightenment... - Do it. -Come on. ...the one and only Professor... - Wolf, do it. - ...uh, Professor... ...um... ...Professor Marmalade! Chief, may I do the honors? That's not the plan. What is happening? He's gone rogue. A deal's a deal. By the power vested in me, it is a pleasure to grant the Bad Guys a full par... - That was weird. - The meteorite is gone! Somebody stole it! Chief. - Wolf. - Come on. You can't possibly think that we did this. So long, suckers! Run! Get them! Uh... Here. Here. - What are you doing? - I'm giving it all back. Huh? Excuse me. - What happened back there? - I couldn't do it. What do you mean, you couldn't do it? - I-I-I just... I... - No! - I do not run. - Hut, hut, hut... That is not how I roll. Piranha, don't do anything crazy. Crazy is what I bring to the party, chico. Hey, you're making a mistake. We didn't do it. I know we always say that, but this time it's actually true. A-la-la-la-la. Can't hear you. - Guilty, guilty, guilty. - Talk to Marmalade. We're really good now. He'll tell you. Professor! Change is impossible. You should always judge a book by its cover, and all stereotypes have been affirmed. Stop, for goodness' sake! Let me speak to them. I'm-I'm sure there's been some misunderstanding. Ah, Professor Marmalade. You've got five minutes. No deals this time. Y-You have to help us. Tell 'em. Tell 'em we didn't do it. There, there. Of course you didn't do it. How could you? After all, you're such a good boy. You're such a good boy. That shiver up my spine. The wag in my tiny tail. Arrest them! What if we tried a little experiment, Diane? As you know, my Gala for Goodness... Where the legendary Love Crater Meteorite will be on display for the first time ever. All eyes will be on you tonight, not me. You're such a... Good boy. You. It was all you. What are you talking about, Wolf? The old lady, the Golden Dolphin, good training.. It was all to get us here, so he could steal the meteorite and let us take the fall. Whoa. Whoa, what old lady? And-and why would a guinea pig want a meteorite anyway? Uh, guys, he's creeping me out. Wait, what? What's going on? Someone turn me around. Well, well. So, you finally get it. - Wait. - What? You stole the meteorite? Oh, it's not just a meteorite. I told you guys it's a butt. It's not a butt! It's the ultimate power source. You see, when it struck, scientists found that it emitted an electromagnetic frequency unlike anything else on Earth. I'm going to harness its power to pull off the greatest heist the world has ever seen. You should've eaten him when you had the chance. - Yep. - But why us? Because you're the perfect patsies. Come on, when people look up "bad" in the dictionary, do they see a sweet, adorable guinea pig? No. They see you. And they always will. Okay, fine. But you set us up. Oh, pish-pish. Let's be honest.. Evolution set you up. But Wolfie here really clinched it. You fell for every one of my traps, starting with saving a helpless little old lady. Wolf, what's he talking about? Whoops. Did I say too much? Anyhoo, looks like, yet again, the Big Bad Wolf got outsmarted by a little piggy. You little pouchy-cheeked rat! I'll kill you! You hear me? - You're dead! You're de... - Help! Help! Help! The Big Bad Wolf is attacking me. Oh, now you are done forever, Wolf! Professor, Professor, any thoughts on how the Bad Guys managed to steal the meteorite in plain sight? Well, off the top of my head, perhaps they accessed the site previously and set up an intricate system - of tunnels and trapdoors... - Uh-huh. ...that could be remotely triggered to suck the meteorite down into a holding area, - but how should I know? - Totally. I mean, they're the deranged masterminds, not me. I'm giving it all back. ♪ ♪ I can't believe we got double-crossed by a tiny rodent.

Does that sound familiar to you, Wolf? Why-why would you think that? Oh, I don't know, maybe because you just sabotaged the biggest heist of our lives. I think you owe us an explanation, buddy. Okay. You're right. This is what happened. Back in the museum, I just tried to steal an old lady's purse. Classic snatch and grab. Tried to? Since when do you try to steal something and not just steal it? I was trying to steal the purse when the old lady fell and... I kind of helped her. What? I kind of helped her. But then you stole her purse. No, I didn't. I saved the old lady, and she hugged me, and my tail wagged, and I didn't know what it was, but it felt, uh, you know... good. Ah. But then you stole the purse. No!

At least he sees the world for what it is: A place where some people are scary and some people are scared. Oh, yeah? Well, I'm tired of being scary. I'm-I'm tired of being an outcast. Maybe I don't want to be a... What? A Bad Guy? Don't want to be a Bad Guy anymore, huh? Say it, Wolf. Yeah, I thought so. And us, your lifelong friends? We're just holding you back?
