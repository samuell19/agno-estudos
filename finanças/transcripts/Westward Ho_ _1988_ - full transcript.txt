(adventurous music) (dolphins splashing) (tense music) - [Narrator] It is 1572, and England is the most powerful nation on Earth. The good ship Queen Elizabeth is returning from the new world, laden with gold and spices. Aboard is the merchant William Salterne, and his daughter Rose. With them is young Lucy Oxenham, whom they are escorting back to England for schooling. (dolphin whistling) (dolphin splashing) - 'Tis a fine morning Captain! - Aye, Mr. Salterne. And not a sign on the accursed Spanish, either. - Surely it is not likely they'd be sailing in these waters. We're too far north! (ship creaking) (tense music) - Ship ahoy! Ship ahoy! - [Captain] What flag does it fly, sailor? - Ugh, it's the ruddy Spanish! Cap'n, Cap'n! Spanish galleon astern! - Oh, no! Oh, no! - Oh, Lord! Can we outrun 'em, Captain? - That I don't know, but by God, we'll try. - Don't be afraid, Lucy. - All hands to the mast! (exciting music) (laughs wickedly) - The filthy English. They are so brave, they run away! (both laugh wickedly) (exciting music) - It's as bad as I feared. Worse. - Worse? - Aye. It's the Spanish murderer and pirate, Don Guzman. And his ship out guns, us 10 to one. (exciting music) - English, you die. - Prepare to fire. Five, four, three, two- (cannon blasting) (laughs wickedly) - I'm afraid we must surrender, Mr. Salterne. They'll blast us out of the water, otherwise. - Fire! (cannon blasting) (mast creaking and crashing) (laughs wickedly) - Don Guzman! You may have the ship and you may murder me if you wish, but there are fair English women on board. Spare them at least. (chuckles nastily) - A beautiful se単orita. (chuckles) Bueno, bueno. Wait, Fernandes! I think I am in love. (chuckles) (ocean waves splashing) (pirates talking excitedly) - Si, se単orita, Don Guzman does not kill the English. A true Spanish gentleman does not murder his enemies when they are defenseless, heh. - No. He just lets them drown, instead. They'll never reach England in that little boat. - And not in a big boat, either. (chuckles) Fernandes? (Don Guzman chuckles wickedly) (cannons blasting) (cannonballs exploding) (laughs wickedly) (pathetic music) (birds chirping) (calm music) - [Salterne] And so you see before you living proof that is takes more than a dirty Spanish pirate to kill a good Englishman. (crowd cheering) - But the sad fact is that my daughter, Rose and Lucy Oxenham are now prisoners of that murdering blackguard, Don Guzman. - How do we know them women didn't just run off with them Spanish, eh? (snickers) Old Salterne's such a miser, he's probably more worried about his gold. - What?! How dare you defile the good name of Salterne? (Man stammers pathetically) (water splashing) (crowd laughing) - I can't believe it! Is that you, Amyas Leigh? - Aye, Mr. Salterne, it is! Arrived back this very day after voyaging round the world with Francis Drake. (crowd cheering) - Amyas, you're the very man I need. I'd be prepared to pay any cost, if you'll round up a crew of brave Englishman to sail to the Americas to rescue Rose and Lucy from the clutches of Don Guzman. - Then, sir, I am your man. Come on, men! Who will come with me? - I'll be the first, Amyas. And I've many brave friends in Plymouth who'll join us. - Proud to have you with me, Will Cary. I, too, have friends in Plymouth who sailed under Drake. Come. We leave tonight. (crowd cheering) (sinister music) - [Will] Hardly seems like old England, Amyas. - It's not. This is Hell's Corner. It's a place of murderers, thieves, and outcasts. They call themselves, "The Gubbings." They're hardly human. (crows cawing) (sinister music) (horse whinnying) (crows cawing) (tense music) (alarming music) (rocks creaking and crashing) (hatch creaking open) (horse whinnying) (both grunt) (all grunting and yelling) (dramatic music) - (stammers) K- k- kill! (Gubbings laugh) (branch snapping) (Gubbings leader thudding on ground) - (stammers in alarm) A black demon! (all yelling in terror) - Whoever you are, you're a friend of mine for life. I'm Amyas Leigh. - And whatever you are, you can fight. I'm Will Cary. - And we're bound for the Americas to rescue two English maidens. We need brave men of your kind. - (laughs loudly) As to who I am, I'm Salvation Yeo. As to what I am, I'm what they call a free man. I was aboard an English ship, the Queen Elizabeth, before she was blowed out of the water and they left me for dead. But here I am, still alive, eh? (laughs loudly) - Then you must know Mr. Salterne, the merchant. - Yes. And poor Miss Rose and Lucy. They're gone with that Spaniard. Maybe dead now. - And will you come with us? - A free man can do what he want. You can count me in. I'll do anything to help save Miss Rose and Lucy from that villain, Don Guzman. - And there'll be adventure and danger on the high sea. And Spanish gold. - Mmmm, Spanish gold, huh? I'm with you! - [Narrator] And so it was that a few weeks later, Captain Amyas Leigh and his crew set sail for the Americas via Jamaica. A voyage, which for some would mean greatness, and for others, death. (dramatic music) (ocean waves splashing) (dramatic music) (whale blasting water and crying) (tense music) (Amyas sighs) (Yeo puffing) - Doing my best, Captain Leigh, eh? (laughs) (exciting music) (seagull squawking) (sailor snoring) - Land! Land ahoy! - Antigua, at last! We'll take on fresh supplies at the mission. - Not before time. We're low on fresh water and the rations have almost gone. It's been a hard voyage, 10 good men in Davy Jones' locker. - Aye. And we might not have seen the worst of it yet, Will. (ocean waves splashing) (somber music) - It looks like someone has been here before us. (dramatic music) (sailor thuds on pier) (boots stomping on pier) (wood creaking) - There may be survivors. Best look around, Will. Salvation? (pot lid clanking) (mysterious music) (monkey screeching) - What's this, then? - I Teo, Indian warrior. (Yeo laughs) - And I Salvation Yeo, King of the World. (laughs loudly) (monkey screeching and hollering) - Okay, okay, no offense. Now exactly what are you two doing here? - Teo have no mother, no father, no tribe. English priest teach me. Now he gone. - And what happened here, boy? - Everyone gone. Buildings burn. I escape. - Who did this? Indians? - No, no, Evil One. Don Guzman. - Hmm. The captain better know about this. Don Guzman, eh? That's exactly who we've been looking for. (stately music) - [Soldier] Hey, hey, amigos! Look at this! - [Guzman] Just one little kiss, Se単orita Rosetta. And then you will fall in love with me. (Guzman smooching lips) (Rose slapping Guzman) - No! No! I'd rather kiss a snake! - Huh? A snake?! (soldiers gasping) - Se単orita, you are insulting the greatest lover Spain has ever known. Where I come from, the women fight each other for just one little kiss from the great Don Guzman. (Rose exclaims in disgust) - You pig! Murderer! (Guzman shouts in anger) (shoes clacking on floor) - [Soldier] El Capitano! Capitano, one of our patrols has sighted an English ship (spits noisily) taking on supplies down the coast. - Oh, (chuckles) well, well. (laughs wickedly) We will prepare a little surprise for them. (laughs wickedly) (both laughing wickedly) (adventurous music) (waves and dolphins splashing) (tense music) - Ship ahoy, Captain! - What are we going to do, Captain, eh? Can't run, is faster than us. - No, Salvation. We stand and fight. (cannons blasting) (exciting music) - Fire! Fire! Destroy! (cannons blasting) (cannonballs exploding) - That's it, lads! Keep it steady. Save your cannonballs. We fight for Mother England! - Kill, kill, (speaks Spanish). (cannons blasting) (quirky music) - This is kind of against the rules, Teo, but now and then, a man has to bend the rules just a little. (tense music) (cannon blasting) (ship exploding) (water rushing) (crew cheering) (ship creaking) - Uh, no! (speaking Spanish) (English crew cheering) (speaking Spanish) - Do something, (speaking Spanish)! - Oh, no! Do something, do something! (silly music) (soldier splashes in ocean) (tense music) (cannonball rolling and slamming) - You die, English! (rousing music) (cannonball clanging) (cannon exploding) (Guzman exclaiming in shock) (Guzman shouting) (Guzman splashes in ocean) (crew cheering) - All right! We've won, but we're not out of danger, yet. We've taken a lot of damage. Quick, men! To the pumps and hoist the mainsail! There's land within the hour, God willing. (Guzman sputters and spits) (ship creaking) (water dripping and splashing) - Done a lot of things in my time, but working alongside a monkey, that's something else. (monkey screeches) (water splashing) (monkey screeches) - Do that again, monkey, and I'll twist your tail off as soon as we reach land. (monkey blowing raspberry) (adventurous music) - It's land, men! Prepare to take her onto the beach. (ship splintering on rocks) (crew sliding and thudding on deck) (tense music) (monkey screeching happily) - [Will] What now, Amyas? She was all we had. - Aye. All we had. And to tell you the truth, Will, I fear we face a great deal of danger. We may be lucky to escape with our lives from this. (dramatic music) - [Guzman] I tell you two things, Fernandes. I, Don Guzman, never give up. Soon as we get back, I take another ship and this time we will get the English, this time we'll really kill them! (dramatic music) - We'll leave the men to unload the rest of the supplies and go up to the top of that ridge to scout around. (birds chirping) - [Teo] Land of monkey and Teo behind mountains. White man's house on big water. - What's he saying? House on big water? - Mmm, I'm not exactly sure. - Hey, I've got it. He's talking about the Spanish Port of Santa Marta over the mountains. Means ships will be there Maybe we could steal one, eh, Captain? - But there's hundreds of miles of jungle and mountains between here and that port. - It's our only hope of rescuing Rose and returning to England. We must try. - Don't forget. You have Teo. He will guide you. (monkey hooting) (cannons blasting) - Oh, no! Don Guzman! (stately music) - That accursed Spaniard has captured our crew! We must help them or die trying! - Captain, I'm sorry, but dying is exactly what will happen if we try to rescue them men. We've got to live to fight another day. - Salvation's right, Amyas. The only way we can help the men is to stay with our plan. - Right then, my brave lads. Westward ho, it is. (stately music) (boots crunching on sand) (Fernandes thudding and splashing) (stately music) - So, (chuckles) the brave Englishman thinks he can escape Don Guzman, eh Fernandes? (chuckles) Bring out the horses. - And, and we kill English? (spits noisily) To death! (chuckles wickedly) (stately music) (horses whinnying) (birds chirping and crying) (insects buzzing) (horse hooves stomping) (monkey hooting and screeching) - Teo, tell that monkey if he don't shut his mouth, I'll chop his tail off. - No chop, no chop! Monkey friend. Listen for trouble. Protect everyone. - Calm down, Salvation. The monkey's got better ears than we have. He's on watch for us, I'm sure. (monkey hooting and screeching) - You hear that, Amyas? - Aye, I do. Sounds familiar. Like- Oh, no! Horses! It's Don Guzman! The cunning swine! Quick! We must move from here! (horse hooves stomping) (speaking Spanish) - [Amyas] They're closing in! (tense music) (monkey screeching) (tense music) (all thudding on ground) - Look! (grand music) - Good work, Teo! I think we're saved. Quickly! (horse hooves stomping) (horses panting) - Whoa, I've got a bad feeling about this. - Don't look down, man. Hold tight. (planks creaking) (boots stomping) (stately music) (horse whinnying) (Fernandes yelling) (all shouting indistinctly) - Charge! - Oh, dear. (all shouting indistinctly) (ropes snapping) (soldiers exclaiming in fear and yelling) (bridge creaking and thudding) (all laughing) - That's the prettiest sight I ever did see. (laughs) Like monkeys on a rope. (laughs) - Cowards! Leeches! Chickens! Sewer rats! Pussycats! - Pussycats and sewer rats, eh? Least we're alive and free! (laughs loudly) (monkey screeching) (melon whistling through air) (melon splatting) (Guzman shouting) (monkey hooting) (all laughing) - [Amyas] Come. We still have a long journey ahead of us. It may not be the last we've seen of Don Guzman, either. - Huh, the fools, the fools. Do they not know they are coming to the land of the man-eating Indians? (chuckles) No one who has ever gone there has come out in one piece. (chuckles) (Fernandes chuckles) - Little pieces. - I have won. The English pigs are finito! (laughs wickedly) They are dead! - [Fernandes] Dead! (birds chirping and crying) (leaves rustling) - I'm sorry to ask, Amyas, but do you have any idea just where we're going? - The exact name of the place? No. But there have been strange stories about this land, Will. Legend has it that there's gold to be found here and- (dart whistles and thuds) And Indians! (exciting music) - All not move. Guajiro Indians. Much danger. - Where aren't any Indians? (speaking foreign language) - Don't shoot. We're English! - English? (sinister music) - [Yeo] Everyone (gong ringing) - [Yeo] Duck! (darts whistling and thudding) (Teo speaking foreign language) (speaking foreign language) - What's he saying to you? Is we going to be eaten? - Not sure. Maybe. (speaking foreign language) - Don't know about you, monkey, but I'm not sure I liked that last bit about the "eaties." (exotic music) - This must be a lost city of the Incas. - Home of sun god. (exotic music) (Guajiro singing and talking indistinctly) (exotic music) - It's the end, I'm afraid, Amyas. - Don't worry, Will. We shall boil with dignity, like true Englishmen. - Boiling with dignity? I'm going to boil with pain. (monkey screeches) (speaking foreign language) - Teo. Is he saying what I think he's saying? - No, he make choice. Who to eat first. (Guajiro muttering indistinctly) (Guajiro shouts excitedly) (speaking foreign language) - Yum, yum, you! - Don't you 'yum, yum, you' me! I'm Mister to you, Mr. Salvation. Stew? (sinister music) (rope snapping) (exotic music) (crowd chattering excitedly) (flames crackling) (pot sputtering and bubbling) (exotic music) (shouts in foreign language) - Teo? What the devil is going on here? Who is that? - The Sun Child from Land of Gods. (speaking foreign language) (Guajiro talking indistinctly) (tense music) (ropes snapping) - Next time, you boys come round to my place and I'll cook you dinner. And we'll have beans. Lima beans, not human beans. Phew! - Tell her we're English, Teo. That we're very grateful to her for saving our lives. (shushes Amyas) - Sun Child wishes to speak with us. Alone. Come. Say nothing. (tense music) (all gasping in awe) - Upon my soul! Miss Lucy! - Mr. Salvation! - Oh, child, child, you sure is a sight for tired old eyes. You've been safe all this time, cared for by them Indians. Praise be! (exotic music) (locket chain clinking) (locket tinkling musically) (monkey screeching) - Westward, ho! - [Narrator] Amyas Leigh and his friends left Inca city and struck out for the ocean, many miles away. With them, the Sun Child, or Lucy Oxenham as she was now known to her English friends. (peaceful music) (foot splashing in water) (Yeo exclaiming in pain) (fish snapping teeth) - What that? What that? (fish snapping teeth) - Fishes eat man. Piranha. - Piranha, huh? Wait'll I tell the folks back home about this! (tranquil music) (birds chirping) (bird squawking) - Look, there it is. The Spanish port of Santa Marta. - [Will] Aye, Amyas. And beyond that, the sea. - [Yeo] It looks a mighty long way to me, Captain. - No. Not far. Teo know secret path on river. But first, we make raft. Come. (ax chopping) (tree thudding) (coconut thudding) (monkey screeching) (cutlass whacking coconut) (birds chirping) (Yeo slurping) (monkey screeching) (coconuts knocking and thudding) (all laughing) (bird screeching) (tranquil music) (water trickling and splashing) (oars splashing) - And after that the Evil One, Don Guzman, sailed away and sold me to the Indians for much gold. - He sold you? Like a slave? - (laughs) Oh, no. Guzman thought he sold a slave, but the Indians treated me like a goddess. They called me, "Sun Child, Daughter of Gods." (waterfall roaring) (tense music) (monkey screeching) - Hold on, everyone! (all yelling) (raft splashing) (all bubbling and splashing) - Some shortcut, Teo! - We'll rest here until the morning. We should be in Santa Marta tomorrow. - There. You've been a brave young lady. (crocodile growling) (Lucy screaming) (crocodile's teeth snapping) - Lucy! (exciting music) (vine snapping) (crocodile and Lucy splashing) (Yeo splashing) (Yeo and crocodile splashing) (air bubbles popping) (Yeo splashing) (triumphant music) (crocodile whistling through air) (crocodile bouncing on branch) (Lucy screams) (quirky music) (monkey screeching) (monkey chomping spider) - Hey, monkey, that's disgusting!

We've found them! (ship creaking) (ocean waves splashing) (oars splashing) (soldier snoring) (ship creaking) (soldier snoring) (helmet clanging) (exciting music) (stick smacking soldier's head) (men snoring) (hatch grating on deck) - Men! It's Captain Leigh. - Captain Leigh? Mr. Cary! 'Cor, love us. It's a bleeding miracle. (ocean waves splashing) - Is Don Guzman aboard? - No, sir. He offloaded us. We were about to sail to Jamaica to be sold as galley slaves. - Men. We're going to take the ship. - You can count on us, Captain. - And Salvation? You take the men to the crew's quarters. Will and I will deal with the officers. - Teo fight, too. - No, Teo. You have something more important to do. Guard young Lucy, here, with your life. Now, men. Into the fray! (men snoring) (tense music) (door creaking) - Come on, men! Hit 'em hard! (all shouting) (swords clanging) (water splashing) (door banging) (exciting music) - Now tell me, you dirty slave trader, where is Don Guzman? - (stammering) Commander Don Guzman? To the north. In his fort at La Guaria. - And Se単orita Rose? - Ah, the English se単orita? She alive, but- - But what?! Speak up, you swine, and quickly! - (stammers) I think Don Guzman is to make the se単orita his wife. - [Amyas And Will] What?! - Quick, Will! There's not a moment to lose! (stately music) (serious music) (crowd muttering) - So, Se単orita Rose, (chuckles) is not Don Guzman a clever man? (chuckles) First, I led the stupid English to kill themselves in the jungle. (Fernandes laughs wickedly) - And then, I make a little expedition to make a little money from my Indian friends. (chuckles wickedly) - You mean you steal that girl from them at the point of a gun. You're utterly despicable! - Despicable? Oh, no, se単orita. (chuckles) Utterly, uh- Hmm. Brilliant! Hmm? (laughs wickedly) (Fernandes laughing) (horse whinnying) - Ah, se単orita, I almost forgot. I have a little surprise for you. - I want nothing from you, Don Guzman. - (chuckles) I will give you better than nothing. (chuckles) I will give you everything. I, Don Guzman, am about to become your husband. - My husband?! Oh! Never! (bright music) - You sure this is going to work, Captain Leigh? - It must work. We didn't come all this way to fail. I'm sure the Spanish will not look twice at one of their own ships flying one of their own flags. - Look! Fort of Don Guzman. - I just hope we're not too late. (military music) (somber music) (door creaking and slamming) (Rose grunting) - [Rose] Let me go, you monster! (soldiers cheering) - Will! Run up the English flag. We'll not fight under the banner of Spain. (military music) (flagpole squeaking) - Uh-oh! (hatches creaking) - Does anyone gathered here know why this man and this woman should not be joined in holy matrimony? - Yes. Me! - (simpers) Oh, I'm sorry, se単orita. You don't count. You're only the bride. (laughs) (military music) - Make sure of your aim. Steady. - And do you, Rose Salterne, promise to love and obey your husband until death do you part? - No- - Fire! (cannon blasting) (cannonball exploding) (cannon blasting) (boots clattering) (soldier whispering) (Fernandes whispering) - On with the ceremony! - For the Queen and England! (crew yelling excitedly) (exciting music) - [Guzman] Enough. On with the ceremony. (crew yelling) (helmets and pikes clattering) - I pronounce you man and- (triumphant music) - Amyas. - Yes, Miss Rose. Sent by your father to rescue you. - [Rose] Oh. I never thought I'd see- Salvation? I though you were drowned. - Salvation? Take Miss Salterne back to the ship. Will, come with me. We have unfinished business with Don Guzman. (boots clattering) - Fool! Call the guards and close the door, quick! - Si. Close the guards and guard the doors. No. (door slamming) Guards! Guards! No. Oh! (door creaking open) (fist smacking Fernandes) (exciting music) - Lock the doors, Will. (door shutting) - I'll deal with Guzman, myself. (exciting music) (swords clanging) - Perhaps you would like to surrender now, English? I have you exactly where I want you. (swords clanging) (Guzman grunting) (sword clattering) (sword whistling and twanging) (coins tinkling) - Let me die quickly, English. - No, Don Guzman. I am not a murderer, but you will answer for your crimes in an English court of law. (soldiers yelling) (soldiers banging on door) (oars splashing) (cannons blasting) - Captain. (shushes Amyas) (chest scraping) (Guzman thudding on boat) (Fernandes thudding on Guzman) (soldiers banging on door) (door splintering) (soldiers talking excitedly) (triumphant music) (crew chattering excitedly) - Well done, men. Miss Rose, Lucy? We'll have you home within the month. Set sail, lads. We're bound for England. (crew cheering) (birds squawking) - [Salterne] And so to all of you brave men, the town of Biddeford and all of England thanks you. And this very morning I have received a message from Her Majesty the Queen, announcing the knighthoods of Amyas Leigh and Will Cary. (crowd cheering) - And Salvation Yeo. (crowd cheering) - Hmm. Sir Salvation Yeo. Well, how about that? (adventurous music)
