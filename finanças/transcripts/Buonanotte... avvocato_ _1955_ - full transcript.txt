&lt;Alberto: Dearest! Good morning, lawyer! Dear lawyer Broggi, the sentence is very hard, huh? But whoever lasts it wins! Don't block me, please! I have the eleventh. Call me! &lt;Alberto! - Vittorio! - When does your wife leave? - At 12:30. - And when do we meet? - At 21:30! - Why are you running away now? - Eleventh ... I have a hearing. - What cause is it? - Won! Vittorio! Nice guy, huh? - Poor thing compared to tonight! - At 21:30! - Compared to the evening! - Do not disappoint me! - Ad maiora! (LAUGHS) - Sibenik lawyer? - Yup? - 250,000 lire. - Uhè, Bicini! The thief's father, huh? - My son is innocent. - Yes, but he has the face of a thief! They also said to me that I have that face and instead I am a gentleman. See you, Bikini! - Is this matter resolved? - You're taking it away today. All right? - Lawyer! Lawyer! - Yup? - The lawsuit begins! - I come! - Lawyer. - Yup? - I'm not telling you anything. And what do you have to say? Be quiet! I have the case in hand! Bicini, come and hear! &gt; President: You got away with it this time . But watch out next time: ... you will be indicted as a false witness! I got it? Street! &lt;The floor to the Public Prosecutor. &lt;PM: While we are convinced of the accused's full awareness ... ... having no evidence of the crime at our disposal ... ... we ask this court for absolution for lack of evidence. (BRUSIO) &lt;The defense of course has nothing to add. - Yes Yes Yes. - Lawyer, acquittal has been requested! Well... ...Mister President... ... the prosecutor asked for the acquittal of the accused and so far we are in agreement. But he asked for it due to insufficient evidence! And on this we are not and cannot agree! We reject any compromise! Or acquittal with full formula or condemnation! Either innocent or guilty! This is the point. And if, in his unjust request, the prosecution was influenced ... ... from the face of the accused ... ... I can assure you that the face of a thief does not make a thief. An individual with this face is completely unable to steal! Mister President... ... people, when they see it, immediately put their hand in their wallets! And this when he steals? (BRUSIO) To steal, my lords ... ... it takes an honest face like hers! Pardon! Like mine, like that of many others. Therefore, having regard to articles 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 ... ... and 36 of the criminal code ... ... I ask for absolution with full formula ... ... because the face does not constitute a crime! (BRUSIO) In the name of the Italian people, the Court, having regard to art. 624 of the penal code ... ... declares Federico Bicini guilty ... ... and sentenced him to one year in prison. All right? Basins: Piece of ... Antonia, please: ... before you leave, prepare dinner for the lawyer. &lt;Well. - Then he, of course, will tell you not to come these days. - But you come anyway. - At 8:00! Don't worry, I'll take care of it! - Ah! Is the bar cabinet closed? - Here's the key. - Are you staying out long? - Tonight we arrive ... ... there is the ceremony, the services tomorrow and the day after tomorrow I'm here. - He has arrived! - Is that you, honey? &gt; Yes! - And do you carry an umbrella? - Yup. &lt;Here, lady. - But no, I'll leave it at home. So much, I lose it! No, take it! Water and laughter come to the unexpected . So I'll bring it! &gt; Clara: Alberto! - Yup! I come! - Alberto, hurry up, or I 'll miss the train! - Ah, yes, go! But how can I stay a week ... ... without 'is my Capoccetta? - But I'm only gone two days! - There are too many! - But also three! - Only two! - Ah, two! Thank god! - Let's hurry up, two days pass quickly! - Thing?! I'm kidding! - And how did the case go? - Come on, you miss the train! - You lost it. - Not at all! 50,000 lire! - Only 50,000 for a criminal case? - A causetta! 5 minutes of speech ... ... 10,000 per minute! And even if the prosecution got swayed ... ... from the features of the accused, I can assure you ... ... that the face of a thief does not make a thief! - Six months! - One year. Here we go. - I want to see when you win a case! - If I didn't speak ... ... who knows where that was! - At his house! What was it? Another unemployed? What do you do? Considerations? - I?! - Yes you! - The ticket! - What's up? - The ticket! - Hurry up, it's late! - There's time! - You're not coming tomorrow, huh? - I already knew that. Here we go? - And the Pirani hasn't arrived yet? - I did not see her. - Look, all the banners on your head, huh? - All right. Thanks. - Clara! - Yup! - It's all OK. The suitcases are in this compartment. - Good. Now the other ladies arrive. Try to be friendly, you know I care. Why, haven't I been? Even when you introduced me ... Antonella? Yes, the countess Antonella Chiaramonte. But you've been a little too hard! - Sure, she's pretty! - Ah, is she pretty? I do not remember? - Ah, you don't remember, huh? - No... - Oh, Mrs. Sibenik! - Dearest! - Here too! I thought I didn't see her. - Countess ... My ... These husbands are tyrants: They would never want to let us go! Wow! That says? I'm glad Clara is distracted! Go! - Is your group complete? - Only the Chiaramonte is missing. - Ah, missing? - Yes, missing. - D'Alessandri was looking for her. - And where? - He's leading with the banners. - So, excuse me, but I have to go. - You are welcome! - A tout à l'heure! Countess ... - Always being funny, huh? - Because? - Look, wives always know everything. - But what? So, even if they aren't there, try to go straight! - And don't look like a victim! - Oh well ... - That I know you! Even the last time, when Antonia came in the morning ... ... did not find you at home. - Yes, you believe her! She hates me! Someday I'll let you find it swaddled! - Where are you going tonight? - And where? To sleep! - Good boy! - You, rather, do not be the gnoccolona! - In the carriage! - Have the heavy banner carried to the Countess! - Be calm! - Hello. And be careful where it goes! Easy, Capocce '! - Alfonso, take care! - I'll miss you. - So, are you staying home tonight? - Yes! - Good boy! Alfonso, why don't you see the lawyer? You would keep company! - No, Clara? - Of course! Is an excellent idea! Yes, you can go to the cinema or cafe to watch TV. - Great idea! - Countess, of course! Will you allow me to introduce myself? I'm the President's husband. - Šibenik lawyer. - Very pleased. - Me too...

My wife? - The woman. - Was my wife there? - No, the lady wasn't there. So, I slept here. I tried to get into the room, but I couldn't. Without my wife, I cannot enter my room.

(CRIES) ... because I slept on the sofa. - Oh, poor young man! - Eh, love, what love is! - Have you ever been in love? Love and youth ... what was was! - Are you romantic too? - Not at all! - Antonia! Say this, shut up with my wife! I don't want you to worry. I'm going out, Antonia! We usually consider women a fragile object ... ... worthy of all respect, but when this woman tries ... ... with deception and takes other people's stuff ... ... then she is a thief and as such must be harshly considered. &lt;We don't get used to looking with an eye ... - Hello. - You made me do a clown figure last night! - I have to talk to you. - What do you mean? - It's important. - Not important? - They stole 200,000 lire from me. - What am I interested in? Go to the police! A woman who slept with me last night stole them from me! - What was it like? - What do I know? You have to advise me. See you at 3pm. - I can not. - At 16:00. - All right. - Was she pretty? - Not pretty! She was a thief! She stole too. I would give her 30 years! - Ahó! My guild is innocent! Did you understand? - Yup. I always say that ... ... that, when talking to customers, 1st and 2nd class should not be specified! - Okay, it will be done. Welcome, gentlemen. - Eh ... - What can I do for you? - Get up, I do. - Are you Bianca Maria's grandfather? - Do you know my niece? Yes, he lives upstairs. I met her tonight ... ... in a somewhat unfortunate circumstance . - Something serious? - Yes, quite. You see ... ... my wife left me alone. - Poor! And she understands that when a man is alone ... ... needs comfort. - And call it comfort! Suddenly Bianca Maria arrived. Oh! My niece is always like this: As soon as such circumstances arise ... ... she is always ready. - And where is he now? I would like to thank you... ... for what he did for me because he is not at home! There is no reason why a little trouble has happened . And when a hindrance happens, he takes refuge from his mother ... ... which is my home. - Yup? And where is this refuge located? A little far, out of the way ... in a small villa in Via dei Tigli 76. Via dei Tigli ... the refuge is there. - Via dei Tigli 76. Let's go! - Look how accurate this is ... But are his wife's funeral taking place? Tiè! Let's leave! - Have you seen? Pain drives people crazy . - Sure! And what's crazier is my nephew! Has a death below ... ... and does not feel the duty to inform me! - You're right, Commander. (MUSIC) - She stopped near the phonograph! - But who? - Marilina, Bianca Maria's sister! - Ah! - Invite her! Can't you see that she is alone? I don't like dancing. (MOTHER SIGHS) Dear Mrs. Broggi, I'm sorry if I leave you alone ... ... but there is always a lot to do in these holidays! - But do you think, Donna Elvira? - And your son doesn't dance? Yes, he danced so far! He's getting some rest. What a dear boy! (Laughs) This youth would never stop! My daughter Marilina would dance all day! - Besides, I'm not letting you leave the house. - Sure! Better at home, with safe friends! - Now excuse me, I have to go. Permission. - You are welcome. - Hi Massimo. Have you heard? She is also a decent girl. Then, Bianca Maria is married and all the stuff will be hers. They even have the cemetery lighting contract ! That's 6 million a year of income! Not enough for you? I don't marry for interest and I do n't even know if I will marry in life. Ah, who is holding me back? - Madam, will you? - No thanks. I don't dance. Excuse me. - You are welcome. These too. - That's enough? - Yes thanks. - I still insist. - I told her no! - Oh, no? (MAN SIGHS) Patience! - You dance, right? - Yup. (MUSIC FROM INSIDE) Vittorio, do you understand these? With grandpa's pumps ... ... and the taps of Bianca Maria, what a villa! Look'! Which is? If this is the house of the dead, I'll shoot myself right away! Really! What is it? - Excuse me, do you have a match? - That? - A match. - No. - Well, better. So I don't smoke. This is badly resurrected! Welcome! Do they want to have a drink? Without compliments! - Dance? - No. There's someone else dancing here tonight. - I want to talk to Bianca Maria. - But that's my sister! - Oh yes? - I'll call you right away. Antonietta, take the gentlemen's coats ... ... and tell Signora Bianca Maria that friends want her. - Immediately. - With some urgency. - Meanwhile, we dance. Wallets! What do you want? - Man: Do you dance? - Yup. - Dance? - (wincing) Oh my God! No! I am waiting for Bianca Maria. Who is she? Another sister? No, a friend of hers. So, can't you dance? Child, I like you! Mambo! A little mambo! - Your name, please? - Marilina. - Oh, Marilina ... - And its? - Victor, but friends call me Baby Have you seen that how fast it is? He immediately courted Marilina. - Dance with her and you sleep! - I'm not sleeping? - What are you doing here? - How, what do I do? - Yes, what does it do? - You don't know why I came? - No, say. Not here. All right, take a seat. Well then? So what do you want? - Have I come to return the visit? - What are you doing? If my husband comes, you know him. It's terrible! Listen, baby ... ... the story of the terrible husband with me no longer attacks. - There's only one terrible here, and that's me! - For charity! - Sst! - Money out! - What money? - Night fairy, 200,000 lire ... I need it! - 200,000 ?! - But what does that mean? - What went wrong this time! You were unlucky. Grilla, look at my eye! You see it? But who did you take me for? For one who flies over? You sneak into my house ... ... mind your own business, lock yourself up, leave me fast and I have to suffer? Undergo what? - Well, who gives me this money? You or your husband? - What money? 200,000 read. So, it's blackmail. Mascalzone. And think how different it was last night. Go away! I'm not giving her anything! And who gives them to me? - Your husband? - My husband?! - It's monstrous! - And do you notice now? You could have thought about it before marrying him. If it's a joke, it's bad. Please, be good, stop. I understand that you like me as a man. Hunt the money and do what you want with me. - You leave me! And stop calling me you! - Give me the money and I'll give you her. I have only 50,000 lire. Are they enough? Deux cents! I need them all. All right, he will have the 200,000 lire. I'll get them. - Wait here? - No, over there. Joy... ... we do not make other escapes, that I kidnap all the guests there! (MUSIC) Tango! Tango! 150,000? Oh, my child, there are so many! That's equivalent to two first-class funerals . Huh? But can you know what all this money is for? Grandpa, I can't tell you, but it's very important. You have to help me! I do nothing else! Your sister and your mother have something important every day! People don't die and where do I find this money? Come on, grandpa, please! - 100,000 is enough for you? - No, no, 150! So where do I go? - Tango! - Ugh! I want to dance, don't go up the stairs! He didn't understand my style. - Oh! - Oh! Vittorio, come on. Let's go away. - Then? - Let's go out. - But how? Already goes away? - Who is this sucker? Yes, mom, the gentleman has to go away! Mah! Bianca Maria, why did you send a friend away like that? That is not a friend, he is a scoundrel. - Come on, Vittorio! - Alberto! - Here we go! But why leave so soon? It was so good! - We could have stayed! - But why? He gave me the money! - She really was a thief, huh? - Well no?! Strange, however, with this beautiful house ... Go understand! She will be a kleptomaniac. - Too bad because with Marilina ... - She's another kleptomaniac. - Come on, for your own good! Come away! - Sin! Come on, make up your mind! She was left alone again. - But it's a fixation, yours! - But you could settle down! They have a villa, shops, the lighting contract! - Franco, you were right to come! - Is Bianca Maria here? - Yup. Nice party, huh? Youth ... have fun! - Not at all ... It's up, poor thing! It hasn't even gone down. - "Poor!" - You always have the answer ready. True, mommy? - Hello Franco! Ciao. - Forward! I came to get you. - I do not come. - You'd start all over again. - Because? If you don't give me reason ... Jealousy is always for no reason. Anyway, I'm your husband and I'm ordering you to go home! And I'm not coming! I want to stay here! - To continue doing your convenience! - Can you see you're starting over? Stupid me who came to beg you! - I didn't ask you to come. - But it's the last time! - Either come away now or you'll never see me again! - I hope! - Bianca Maria! - Franco, I don't ... - "Not me" what? - That's enough! I can not stand it anymore! - Don't raise your voice! - I can not stand it anymore! - Lower the tone! - Yes, cry, cry! - What are these screams? - What yells? (CRY FROM UPPER FLOOR) Do you feel? It will be my sister with her husband who joke. And do they always joke like that? - Because? Do you think they are bickering? - No... - Touch me, if you are capable! - Would you like to see me go to jail, huh? Get out! Go away, I don't want to see you anymore! &gt; Franco: Don't make me talk! Stop that! &gt; Speak! &gt; Don't make me talk! &gt; Come on, talk! &gt; No! - Good evening, lady, and thank you for a nice evening. - Can you imagine ... (CRY FROM UPPER FLOOR) Seen? They are all gone. That neurasthenic ruined everything for me! Just tonight I could find the boyfriend! - Patience! We will have another party. - Yes, you are right! What is this screaming? What happened? Franco has arrived. - They're reconciling. - Ah! Thank god! Farewell, Bianca Maria. - What are you doing? Are you leaving? - Yes, I'm leaving. - And the lady stays here! - Calm down, Franco! I'll talk to her, I'll fix everything. Tell me one thing: So are you doing the company's interests? Should I kill people to get jobs? You don't have to kill her, but when, with God's grace, someone dies ... ... right in your palace, you might as well warn! - Who died? - The lady who lives below you. The lawyer's wife? But that's not possible! - Why, is it immortal? - And who told you? - He? That his wife died? - And who was telling me? The deceased? - He came here or to the shop. - To the shop! - And did he ask you about Bianca Maria? - Yes, and I told him he was here. They think they're being smart, huh? We will see it! - God what a day! - And what a night! - Alberto, you are too impetuous with women. - Sit down, sit down! You have to know how to wait, to play like a cat plays with a mouse. - Wait ... then at a certain point ... - Can't wait? A man is alone in the house, suddenly a fairy arrives: ... "Help! My husband is following me! Protect me!". It holds me tight. - I was immediately impressed. - Sorry, she did the shot! (laughing) 200,000 lire! - 200 ... - Not at all 200,000? You look stupid! - The swag is here, oh! Are we kidding? - After, after ... What a woman! What an adventure! - (laughing) What an adventurer! - We were like that. Vittorio, we were like that, like you and me now. She was sitting where you and I are next to her. I look into her eyes and say: "Let's take something." "No, thank you. Give me a glass of water." "No water? We need fire, something strong!" I open the bar and give her a little witch, a sherry and an anisette. Streghina, anisetta, sherry, Streghina, anisetta, sherry. Oh! After five minutes, I had her head on my shoulder. So, she, silent, devious, puts an arm around my neck ... ... it clings to me, I shut up, I pretended nothing happened ... ... I look at her and caress her velvety hand. She tells me: "Alberto ...". Ah! I release it, I take the initiative ... ... I grab it, pull it to me and ... - Good evening! &lt;I kiss her! &lt;Good evening! Good evening! Not good evening! It's the truth, Vittorio! Good evening, oh! (VITTORIO RIDE) - But what, are you back already? - Alberto was teaching me ... ... a Japanese wrestling move. - (laughing) Japanese! You know, it's big! (VOICE AND LAUGHTER) - He's a fool ... - He's the fool! (ALBERTO AND VITTORIO TOSSICCHIANO) - Hello. - Are you back yet? Well, the flood came down, a stampede ... ... the banners got wet ... - (laughing) The banners ... - But good! I see you very cheerful. I am pleased to! - The Vittorione is here! Sorry, Alberto, I should tell you something. And you allow? True, Vittorio? One minute! Come on, dear! (LAUGHS) Alberto: What is it? One minute! What's up? Heads, what is it? - What is this? - What's this? What do I know? - It's a hairpin. - And, if you know, why are you asking me? - I found it above the desk. Whose is it? - Whose is it? - It will be yours, right? - Never wear hairpins! - I don't wear them either! It's mine? It will be Antonia's. - About Antonia ?! By Antonia! When he comes tomorrow, ask him! - Do you need anything, madam? I finished it. - Nothing! - Calm down! Sorry, Antonia. Come a moment? - Is this fork yours? - It's yours, tell him! One moment, lady, let me observe. Frivolous fork ... never worn! I use these bone. Frivolous fork, perfumes, lipstick ... Go retro, Satan! I beat my chest. But why don't you send her away with all these proverbs? She will say the proverbs, but she doesn't tell lies and she is honest! In this house another would be enriched with someone like you! - What does it mean? - In this house there is money scattered everywhere! Money? What money? - For example, those who were in the card holder! - In the por ... (shouting) But why are you rummaging? Who gives you permission to search? But who searches? I was writing the memos for you, I saw them and ... - Why did you take them? - And I got them ... ... and I made them safe! Here, look! I rummage! - What a villain you are! - Fry ... She took them ... And these? Oh! Oh God! Vittorio! Vittorio! Vittorio! - Vittorio! We are ruined! - What's up? My wife had put the money in the drawer before leaving! So, wasn't the adventurer a thief? Not a thief! She gave me the money thinking I was blackmailing her! The adventurer ... It was the long-awaited adventure ... ... and I stepped on her, outraged her He loved me! Oh well, you're a blackmailer. Go to jail, article 315. - But I'll defend you, don't worry. - Yes, you defend me! Do you defend? I will bring back the money and I will be forgiven ... ... she will believe me. I will tell you: "Bianca Maria, forgive me!". - Come! Come! - But where? - But where are you going? - Let's go to Bianca Maria! - But what about your wife? - I'm going to Bianca Maria! - Who is this woman? - What woman? - Were we talking about women? - Not me. What women? - I heard Bianca Maria. - Eh, the accountant Biancamaria. - Biancamaria &amp; Company. - The company Biancamaria &amp; Co .... ... which has a lawsuit against itself. A strange cause of Alberto ... Woman! He's a man with such a belly! - Let's go to Via dei Tigli, right? - Come on, it's late! - Good night! - With that character of Biancamaria! - Good night. - Hello, Capocce '. Here we go. (DOOR CLOSES) Biancamaria ... an accountant ... &lt;Antonia: Madam, I'm done and I'm leaving. &lt;Yes. By the way, everything is fine this morning. The lawyer was alone in the house and the bed intact. - And where did he sleep? - I think on the sofa, everything was in turmoil! - I wrote down and report! - On the sofa? And why? Spouse without bride in bed does not rest. - I wrote down and report. - Thanks. You can go. - Good evening. - Good evening. (BELL) Just a moment! Just a moment! - Good evening. - Good evening. Who are you looking for? - Is there ... the lawyer? - No, the lawyer is never here. - Ah. But last night there was. - Last night, yes. - The Lady? - The lady is there. - I knew it. - Isn't she dead? - Dead ?! Here we are all alive and well, and strong, thank God! I am pleased to. Do you want to tell her that the tenant upstairs is here? - All right. - Thanks. - Please, take a seat. You are welcome. I'm going to call her. There is the gentleman on the second floor, the condominium! - Good evening. Are you looking for someone? - Good evening. - I'm the tenant upstairs. - Ah. - Pleasure. - Pleasure. - But is she okay? - Yes thanks. - I was looking for your husband. - And wished? - Information ... - On what? Maybe I can give it to you. - No, she wasn't there. - When? - Last evening. Excuse me, may I know what it is? He will tell him if he thinks it appropriate. Can you tell me where it is? - Well ... in Via dei Tigli, it seems to me. - Via dei Tigli? - Yes, from the accountant Biancamaria. - From the accountant Biancamaria ?! - He knows him? - No, but he's a client of my husband ... ... a fat gentleman with a belly. Does the accountant Biancamaria know? She is my wife! - And this time they won't escape me! - As? Wait a moment! - I'll get dressed and go with her. - Yes, but hurry up! - Very soon! Doesn't seem the case at this hour ... But how? I have to apologize, she took me for a blackmailer! - Go to court, I'll defend you! - Not at all! You stay here, rather, and watch over, in case the husband comes! Stay here! But, Alberto, if the husband comes, what should I do? - Make a signal and warn me! - But no! You get in trouble ... ... and then you involve me. I'm not! - Don't get too involved! Ma ... Alright then! (BELL) &gt; My dear lady! - Ah, no, huh? (BELL) - Mrs! - Well, what do you want? I have to speak to Bianca Maria, it's urgent. - At this time? - Yes. You need to talk to her. Don't insist: Bianca Maria can't and doesn't want to. - Because? Did he say anything to you? - No, but a mother always understands. A married daughter cannot receive strangers at this hour. Go! - Sorry! - What a hell! - Sorry, ma! - What are you doing here? - Marilina! I accompanied Alberto ... ... is talking to Bianca Maria. - Sst! Thing? - I accompanied Alberto, who is talking to Bianca Maria. - Sst! - Wait for me beyond that! - Where is it? Over there! - There? Mommy dear, but why does she persist in not understanding? But, in short, how should I tell him? Bianca Maria is married. - But I'm married too! - Huh? - Yeah. - Well, that's another thing! - Ohà! - But what makes me say? Bianca Maria loves her husband and will never cheat on him. - Okay, but I ... - What more do you want from me? What are you still looking for here? I told her not to show up again. Out! - Do you feel how he treats me? - Bianca Maria, be kinder! After all, he has the only mistake of being in love with you. - Not in love! This is not a gentleman, he is a ric ... - No! You talk like that, because you don't know, but you let me explain. - Well done! Explain! - Thanks, mommy! - We have nothing more to say to each other. - Nice! Bianca Maria ... ... do you recognize? It's hers, it belongs to her. - But what does it mean? A crab, a big crab. It was a rash gesture, but let me explain. Does that friend of yours always have something to say to Bianca Maria? - Is he in love with her? - Mystery! But I have so many things to say to her! I really wanted to see her, to see those eyes, that little nose again ... ... that mouth, that mouth ... I like it so much ... - But Victor! - No, no. Call me Baby! - Baby! What an enterprising! - C'est amoour! #Love, my dear love, we will always love each other. # # This is the beautiful song of a girl and a boy. # Clara: Alberto is here for sure, because his car is out there. You watch the exit, I'm going to close the back door. Do not move. - Do you understand, Bianca Maria? - Well, now that it's all clear ... - But, for this very reason, I'm staying! - Let's not joke! Go now ... ... my husband could come! - Well? I hide like you did last night ... ... she hunts him like I did, I stay, she gives me her room ... ... but I don't lock myself like her! I have faith ... - Be nice, go away. - No! Don't let me out! Don't you understand that I'm afraid? My wife is jealous, she chases me! - He can be out here! - Don't be a baby. Go away. (ALBERTO RIDE) It's a joke! - No, please! - Alberto! - Ahó! Who is it? Mamma Mia! - Long last! - Rogue! - Now you will not deny anymore! - Good evening, dear. - Let me explain! - One moment! You have nothing to explain. It is I who must speak and I will speak! - Permission. Ah-ha, if I speak! - Hurry up. - Do you hear it? He is in a hurry! - Hurry up! Ah! He also has the courage to raise his voice! Respect this house ... ... who saw his wife as a child, then a young girl, then a woman ... ... but always honored and respected! - And that's not all! - I'll kill him ... Silence! I'm your wife's lawyer and you have to listen to me! - Legal ?! - But there came a day, a sad day ... ... that she asked her in marriage! But he didn't offer her a happy, peaceful life, no! He offered her a life of fears, doubts, subterfuges, nocturnal escapes! - Of nocturnal escapes, huh? - Silence! You speak when questioned! But are you hindering me? Shut up, right? But she was not a husband, no! You were an inquisitor ... ... a spy, a spy, who followed her every step of the way. And instead of appearing humble, repentant or begging for forgiveness ... ... also has the arrogance to assume tones of arrogance! However, it will be included in the documents we will present in court. - Court?! - Yes why? Yes, in court! Because there he will have to explain his tyrant behavior! Ah-ha! And I want to see how he will explain it! &lt;Gentlemen, the lawyer has finished, but under the toga is the man ... ... the man who has a heart, a soul, a sensitivity ... ... the man who picked up a poor wife's cry of pain! What are you doing? Grimaces? The cry of this poor woman ... ... frightened and groaning, annihilated and distraught ... ... from the dull suspicion of her husband! Yes, the nuptial bond is sacred ... ... and indissoluble, but it must be founded on affection! True, dear? And not about slavery! &lt;Bravo, colleague! - Thanks! - Am I right? Is the concept right? - Exactly! My client, forgive me the comparison ... ... has a life similar to that of a dog, chained by the owner. ( KISSES ) Canuccio ... &lt;And it's about the life of this poor chained dog ... ... that I bend down with moved pity and make him mine ... ... and I cry. - Good boy! - Piangi, piangi... - Thank you very much! But look at it! Observe the ferocious and malicious flash of his gaze ... ... the cruel and merciless twist of his mouth! &lt;He is silent, yes ... ... but perhaps in his silence he meditates other reprisals, tortures ... ... against the poor animal that awaits mercy and mercy! - Very good! - We are from the same school, modestly! Silence or I clear out! Ahó! Shut up! Are you going to be kids? Silence! And I don't need to dwell on it ... ... to show you that all the elements are in my client's favor ... ... and that the Court cannot fail to recognize his sacred rights ... ... to a legal separation. Permission? - Bianca Maria, what's this separation story ? - Legal! - What are these speeches? - Will you, lady? You don't have to answer, I'm your lawyer. - Talk to yours, you! - Not a lawyer? I don't intend to part! And then she just has to cry, like her illustrious colleague ... ... the one with the black face and all curly. - Who? Othello, who like her was the victim of that insane jealousy! But she doesn't even have the comfort of Verdi's music! Stop, don't move! - Bianca Maria, please ... - Don't give in! &lt;Bianca Maria, you can't want such a thing. I recognize my wrongs, but I cannot part with you. - Don't give up your freedom! - Madam, you'd better give it up ... Your husband seems sincere to me. He understood that his suspicions were unfounded ... ... and my husband too, as a lawyer ... Since he's your lawyer, isn't he? - Yes. ... advises you to forgive him. True, Alberto? Yes, yes. As a lawyer, I should insist on a separation ... ... but as a man and as a husband, I must tell you: Forgive him ... Othello! Return to him! &lt;Go back to your married house! - Above us, right? - Over U.S. Here we go. And now, we can leave the classroom. Gentlemen... - Bianca Maria ... &gt; Alberto! - I'll call you, then. - When you want. - Excuse me. Sorry. Was your friend's wife having a funeral? But which funeral? But think about life! The funeral! You have been a great speaker. You managed to convince everyone ... ... certainly because the cause interested you! - You didn't know me in that respect, huh? - No... Sometimes one judges lightly, has suspicions ... - Because? Did you have any suspicions? - Sometimes... ... especially when I was leaving. I was afraid of some escapade of yours ... ... and, instead, you only thought about work. - Work work... ... for me there is nothing but work. - Yes, now when I leave ... ... I will feel calmer. - Why are you leaving? Sure! With that downpour the work of the congress was suspended ... ... and we will have to take them back. - Oh ... with this congress ... - And now you leave again? - Why are you sorry? But how, you ask me? Sorry, yes! (RELIGIOUS SONGS) .
