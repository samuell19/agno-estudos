...share of transports in gross domestic products is in the neighborhood of 3% but a good transport system is essential to support of economic growth and development, and the lack of it will surely affect the level of our... Close the windows, close the windows! - Oh, hello... - No. Ma, Ma, Ma! Ma. - What? - They are seriously fighting outside. Should we throw him on the ground? Stop this! Stop it! Who's in charge here? Stop it! Hey, quiet. Put him down. Igwe, put the fool down. Go inside. Since morning, we've been bringing passengers to this park. Please give us our money so we can leave! Or else no bus will leave this park. You children of the rich... coming back from America. Please let me ask you... is this how your conduct your business? When you come to Nigeria, you act like a Nigerian. Correct! Or else... This behavior of yours, who does it benefit? Who? Look at all the faces of everybody's life you are stopping right now. For what? What is our business? Taking people from one destination to the other. Contributing to society. So... you say you're a Nigerian? Hm? Yeah, we're Nigerian. Act like a Nigerian, and come back and we'll talk like civilized human beings. Go. We'll give you your money but please go home, and let's get on with our lives. Good speech, Ma. Did you hear her? In due time we'll see what happens. My brothers, let's go. You've not been generous to us. We'll be back. Are you no longer "The Obiagus"? Let's go,. Good morning, sir. Hello. You're welcome. I think we should start now. I know just as much as Adaeze regarding this presentation. She can join us later on. Good morning, gentlemen. Chief. You're welcome. - How are you? - Welcome. We have to start. - Alright, alright. Okay. We can start. - Okay. Right, so regarding the pr... - Sorry. - There she is. Apologies for the lateness, gentlemen. Sorry. Okay. Sorry, dad. Okay. Shall we? Lionheart's transport. Your number one transport service in Nigeria. With over 200 buses and 50,000 passengers catered to weekly, we've built a strong reputation for safety and comfort. From Enugu to any of the 36 states in Nigeria, we are more than prepared to grow with the coast city. This is where we are best suited for the proposed Bus Rabbit Transit, BRT system, being developed for Enugu State. Our fleet is extensive, and our personnel experienced. Lionheart Transport, the right way to travel. That was... really impressive. I must say, the best we have seen so far. We'll set up a meeting with the minister for the final phase. I think we have something on our hands. Chief, you must be a proud father. Of course, I'm immensely proud of my daughter. She's her father's daughter. Congratulations. The most beautiful. Alright, we'll both be going. Yeah. - I'm cool. - Hey. - Chief. - Daddy, Daddy? Daddy? Daddy, what's wrong? - Chief. - What's wrong? - Get someone. - Wait. - Daddy? - Chief, sir. - Daddy, wh... - Call his doctor. Call his... Your company, IG Motors, and Lionheart are both the front runners for the recently announced Enugu State BRT contract. Sir, but in recent light of the unfortunate incident with Mr. Obiagu, do you think this puts your company at an advantage? Oh, stop that young man. This is not the place or time. However, let me make this point. Our transport division is one of the most successful in the entire state. For your information, IG Motors has the capacity to take on new contracts or new companies as the case may be, for the benefit of the people. By companies, are you referring to Lionheart company? Young woman. This is not the time, or the place. However, my deepest condolences... Sorry, my best wishes to him... Can you imagine what this fool is saying? I've told you so many times to take it easy. He sends his condolences. Take it easy. I've begged you multiple times. He obviously paid these journalists. He wants to buy my company while I'm still alive. That'll be over my dead body. What do you mean by "Over my dead body"? Company this, company that. Let them take your company if that will keep you alive. That's enough. Ada, wait, I'm telling you, this is next level shit... Once I shoot this video, everything will change. I'll be successful, I'm telling you. Just help me out, talk to daddy. You said this, these last two videos. We gave you four million, and that went nowhere. How is this different? [in HausaAre you really saying this? Is this how you're seeing it? Don't see things this way, trust me. Just help me talk to him. [in English I'll talk to daddy, but no promises. I suggest you talk to mummy, to talk to him too. No, but you know he only listens to you. Not true, he listens to mummy too. Talk to your dad. Talk to him! Daddy, what have you done? Tell him to get some rest. Oh, daddy, you need to rest. I will not rest until I've dealt with Igwe Pascal. Then I will rest. What has he done this time? Nothing about work here. No. Mummy. Mummy, let's have a chat. Tell me, what about Igwe Pascal? He's gunning for the contract, isn't he? I thought so. Come, come, come... - No, I'm not doing anything. - Yeah, - I promise you. Daddy wh... - My friend, come. Okay, dad, bye bye. - Good morning, GM. - Good morning, madam. Thank you. - Is LH33 running now? - Since yesterday, madam. - Okay, good. - But... Enugu-Sagamu route is running low on passengers. Why? I don't know. It has been happening for some time. Okay, how about Enugu-Auchi? It's booming. - Port Harcourt? - It's okay. Alright, well, re-route some of their buses to those areas and I'll see what's going on. - Alright, madam. - Meanwhile, please, service LH45. - I don't like the way it's sounding. - That we'll do, madam. Okay. Thank you. Good morning. - Good morning, Ma'am. - Morning. - Thank you. - Yes, Ma. The conference call is in 15 minutes. The board members are already gathering in the conference room. - Okay. - Yes, madam. And your meeting with the external auditors is at one o'clock. I think you're going to be a very good MD, Ma. I mean there's no Lionheart without you. No disrespect to the Chairman. My father is still very much alive, Onyinye. But thank you. Anything else? No, no, Ma... Fifteen minutes. As you all know, right now I'm not... in the best of health to carry out my responsibilities. But Lionheart will have to soldier on, until I get back on my feet. You will need new leadership, so that Lionheart doesn't fall behind on the perfect service we provide to our customers. Chief, if I may interrupt here. I believe I speak for the rest of the members of the board when I say that we really respect your judgment. We all have contributed to the success of this company, even though some more than others. But, but you, you are right. This company needs someone with the right kind of vision and drive to take the wheel of this company. You've always been very articulate Samuel, we are all a family. And family is the ideal on which I started this company. In that spirit, I now name my replacement. Chief Godswill Obiagu, my younger brother. For those of you who don't know, Godswill is the MD of our Owerri headquarters. Effectively immediately, he will oversee the day-to-day running of the various departments, while my daughter, Adaeze, will remain as Director of Logistics and Operations. Goodbye, everyone, and good luck. Hello, everyone. Wish you the very best. You're welcome. Sorry, Chief. My name is Samuel Akah, the director of Engineering Services. Please permit me to congratulate you on your appointment. If there's anything you need, just remember me as your Man Friday, sir. I'm impressed. Yes, sir. Well, once again, welcome, sir. Uncle. Adaeze! You're looking good. - I haven't seen you for some time. - Yes. You know you could go for a beauty contest now and win. Thank you, uncle, but I have - my hands full with... the company. - Yes I can see that. - Looking good. - How's aunty and the kids? Well, they are doing great. - They're fine. - Okay. Welcome. - Yeah. - Congratulations, and... I have to go and... I have some catching up to do. No, no, no, feel free. Do whatever you want to do. I'm just going to go round the company to see things for myself. Okay. See you. I'm so sorry, Ma. I really thought your father was going to make you the next MD. So did I. So did I. Ma, should I reschedule your... meeting? - Good morning. - Good morning. Ada. You are not at work? Good morning, mummy. I'm going to work. I just need to see daddy briefly. Your daddy's resting. I know, mummy, but it's urgent. I know, I know... But if it concerns work, please speak to your uncle first. It, it's about uncle and... Wait. You knew Uncle Godswill was coming? Well, your daddy and I discussed it. I don't understand. What is he doing here? Don't slouch! Come on. Let's go talk. - I, I don't get it. - Let's go talk. Sit. Ada. Ada... Your uncle is just here to supervise. Who is he supervising, mummy? If he is doing all the supervision, then of what use am I? My daughter, a second hand always helps. Your father started this company with your uncle, you know. Yes, but I've been working side by side with daddy for over seven years. I should be acting MD. I'm sure he has his reasons, and you're just gonna have to trust him. I bet those reasons would not exist if Obiora were in my shoes. Sit up. And then shut up. Think before you speak. Think. Your father loves and appreciates you, and you know it. His reasons have nothing to do with you being a woman. Just doesn't seem fair. I work really, really hard. It's okay. It's okay. Your uncle is just here to support you. And support I shall. - Goddy. - Abigail. So you are visiting because you heard Ernest is ill? Is this how you welcome me? If you wanted to see me, you would have come to Owerri. Okay, you win. But remember you won't be so lucky next time. - Till then. - But it's good to see you. Look at you. Handsome. Ada-nna, you didn't tell me you were leaving the office. You know we both can't be out at the same time. You see? I'm leaving. Oh, now you're leaving? Is it because I reminded you? Wait. We'll leave together. Listen, there's food. Bitterleaf soup and pounded yam. I can't eat right now. Let me see Chief first then we can talk about food later. Okay. What about Obiora? Obiora sleeps in the studio. That's where he lives. It's all part of the hussle. Uncle, daddy's resting. Let me go and rest with him. But you said he was resting. Don't ever come between two brothers. Wh...? Chief, are you there? I have come! - Welcome. How is your family? - They are all fine. Good morning, daddy. - Adaeze my daughter, how are you? - I'm fine. How are you? Well, I think I am doing well by the grace of God, and the inspiration I get from my brother sitting here. It's a better day. Do you have anything to tell me? Want to tell me something? No, I just came to check up on you. That's very thoughtful of you. Thanks, honey, and God bless you. - I'll head back to the office now. - That's my daughter. Uncle, see you. Odogwu... I don't... I think something is disturbing... she's not happy. I know that she's not happy. And I can understand why. Adaeze needs to understand that life doesn't always go as planned. I brought you over so that you can be of assistance to Adaeze. To come and be of assistance to her. It's a good decision. When it comes to family, we are all on the same journey. True. Where's everybody? ♪ In the morning ♪ ♪ Early in the morning ♪ ♪ In the morning ♪ ♪ I will rise and praise the Lord ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ In the morning ♪ ♪ Early in the morning ♪ ♪ In the morning ♪ ♪ I will rise and praise the Lord ♪ ♪ In the morning ♪ ♪ Early in the morning ♪ ♪ In the morning ♪ ♪ I will rise and praise the Lord ♪ You see, I am going to change a lot of things in this establishment.

I want you to go back to your posts now as people who have received blessing. Amen! Amen. Back, back, back... Praise the lord. Ada-nna. Ada-nna. Morning. You know I wonder why and I was, I was... trying to admonish them to be doing this. It's not all about money. God is the provider of money. Do you know what I'm saying? No, I can see that. Made lots of improvement. Just to warm the place up. So, what's on your schedule, like, today? What is the order of business for today? Well, first things first, we have to get you settled in. I haven't forgot I'm supposed to have an office. You know, naturally you will be in daddy's office which is right there. Odogwu's office, don't go there. Ogodwu is the oracle of this company, I am not qualified to take his seat, no. Look, I don't need anything elaborate. This place is, this is perfect for me now. This is good, yes it is. This is good. Uncle, are you sure? Look, Ada-nna, if you want to spray insecticides on cockroaches, snakes and scorpions, you take yourself, get yourself a vantage position. Here is a vantage position, so I can have my lens all over them. Don't worry. Okay. If you insist. I insist, my dear. No problems. I'll work here. Ma? The external auditors are coming upstairs now. Right now. Okay. I will be in my office. Uncle, I have a meeting with the external auditors. I don't know if you would like to join me. - Is it necessary? Well, if it is... - Yes, so please. Please. Alright. Chameleon. Very good. Thank you for coming. So, given our current situation can you tell us how bad the numbers are? Bad. Try abysmal, madam. But I could have told you that yesterday if you hadn't cancelled our appointment scheduled at... 12:00 p.m., West African time. I apologize. I had an emergency so I had to... We all have emergencies, Miss Obiagu. For instance, I had an emergency appointment with a doctor today at... 9:00 a.m., West African time. Again, I apologize. Now if we can get back to... No, no. Wait. You said you had an emergency with the doctor. Could you tell us what the emergency was? Teeth whitening. With what paint? This thing I'm seeing, it can't be whiter. Throwing away your money. Back to the numbers. Yes. Lionheart is in severe debt. Debt? You people are owing. Nine hundred and fifteen million Naira. What? That's almost one billion! - No. - Nine hundred and fifteen million Naira. Your father took a loan from various banks last year. What was the loan for? Against our advice. Chairman took a loan to acquire... One hundred luxurious buses. For the BRT contract and now it's time to pay up. Okay. Okay. Let's not panic. So what do we do? Pay up your debt. In 30 days. Or, risk losing everything. Good day. Now, wait, auditor. Auditor. Auditor. No, wait, I have something to chip in. One billion! Why would Ernest go to borrow one billion? What for? And without telling me. In this recession. Are you sure these people are telling the truth? Well we have to find out. I... No, it's time to... Let's reach Odogwu. So, daddy, the external auditors showed up today, talking about a loan that you took last year. Nine hundred and fifty million Naira, daddy. Yes, Odogwu. I don't know how you took such an amount without telling anybody. My God. "A man's response to an urgent matter determines his character." Do you understand what I mean? We needed buses to improve our fleet. Agreed. That meant money. I had no choice but to go to the bank and collect some money. - But, daddy... - You know. I think you took a huge gamble. It's not like we've been guaranteed the BRT contract. That's another thing. You see, what's so important to me is the loan, and how the bank is going to recover... Their approach is different when recovering their loan. They will go for your blood when they come back. There should have been alternatives. I agree with what you've said. I got into this business, principally to take people to various destinations in comfort... in style. It has become a legacy with our company. If we lose that legacy, we have lost everything. Daddy, but right now it seems like we have risked everything. You've put us... We've been put in such a vulnerable position right now, daddy, and we don't have that much time on our side. Because of that, I've decided to invite your Uncle Godswill to be a part of this establishment, because I believe that two heads are better than one. Let's see what comes out of the fridge, uh? - Morning. - Good morning, Ma. Morning. Good morning, uncle. You missed the morning devotion. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I was working all night. I came up with a plan, uncle. It's something I call my three-point agenda. Okay. This is good. - Honestly, I must confess. - Yeah, thank you. And, here... take a look. I've been doing some research myself. A transport company in Kano needs a merger with another company from Southeast, and we must not miss this. I don't think a merger is what we need right now, uncle. Really? So what do we need? Trust me. This is a plan that has been tried and tested. It works. So the first thing we need to do, is get an extension on the 30-day loan. I mean, technically 29 now, and I've asked the accountant to set up meetings with all the banks that we owe. And I have one for today which is at... now, so I have to go. We have to go. No, no, uncle, it's okay, I've got this. And, besides, you said one of us needs to stay here so... It doesn't apply here. Listen. if we have to fight this war, Ada-nna, we have to fight it together, unless we want to lose. So... I'm at your service nationwide. Let's go. Okay. I'm afraid I can't give you an extension. I can assure you we have a solid chance at the deal, we just need more time. I'm just asking for you to be patient with us. We're definitely going... Keep talking. Go ahead and talk. I am so sorry. It wasn't approved. Use that against them. Okay, sir. But don't rush. Take your time. Yeah. Okay, sir. - The minute they get there. - Yeah, I think they're here already. Good. Waste their precious time. I'll handle it. - I do not want to be disturbed. - I'll take care of it, sir. So, how can I help you, Mr. and Mrs. Obiagu? No, no. He's my uncle. Yes, she's my niece. Okay, I see. Anyway, we would like to apply for a loan. We have the track record. We have collateral. But most importantly, we have an impeccable reputation. Lionheart. Impeccable reputation indeed. I'm sorry, what's that supposed to mean? Of course, everyone knows that Lionheart is presently facing bankruptcy. Plus your father, he's owing so many banks. So how come you're asking for a new loan? Well... We are not facing bankruptcy. It's just... it's just the times that we're in. It's a minor setback, we'll pull through. It's okay, I expect you to say that. Listen, as the manager, we know the process of obtaining loans. We're not kids. Just tell us what it will take for us to get this loan. Finished. Simple. Well, I really don't understand. What don't you understand, for Kingdom's sake? Look, I give you, you give me. It's give and take. Everything has a price. Even life has a price. Tell us what it will take. - Uncle, what are you doing? - I'm doing business. It's okay, sir, but I hope you are not trying to bribe me. - Oh, God. - Oh, no, no... He's not... Look, what do you mean by bribe? Tell us what you're waiting for, I will give it to you. I've told you name any price. It's okay, it's okay. Calm down. You mean? - Name anything. - My price? Yes, your price. Well... your niece here is not looking bad at all. Excuse me? I mean, she's good. My price. Uncle, you shouldn't have. Abomination. Yes. Yes. Yes. He punched you? What a savage. I see. Which police station? Hey! Excuse me. Do you know the people that you are toying with? Do you? You're finished. Uncle, please, let's not make things any worse. - They are right, we are wrong. - Says who? You can't go about bribing and punching people. Did I punch him? Was a very sluggish jab. If I had punched him, he would have been in hospital by now. He doesn't mean it. At times a jab, one good punch will make a man come back to his senses. Sarge. Ada. Relax. I know what I'm doing. Don't keep blaming me in their presence. Your father knows what I can do and that was why he brought me into this. Relax. If I blow hot, you blow cold. So, no one has come for them. Nobody. Nobody. - Okay, I'm going for a brief meeting. - Okay, sir. - I'll be back. - Yes, sir. Onyinye! Thank God you're here. I can't believe they would actually lock you up in here, like... Do you know who she be? Do you have any idea... It's, okay, Onyinye, it's fine. I'm okay. - Just pay the bail money and let's go. - We have a slight problem, Ma. There's an emergency board meeting going on right now at the office. - Why? What for? - I don't know. Approved by who? Samuel. And Igwe Pascal is in the building. Snakes! Scorpions! Hurry. Pay the money and let's get out of here. Samuel. Ada-nna, who's this Igwe Pascal, and what does he want? Uncle, I don't know, but whatever it is, I'm sure it's not good. Madam, he's not letting me pay the bail. - Why? - I don't know. What's the problem? Madam, my superior is not around. And I can't grant bail if he's not around to sign. So, if your boss suddenly dies, we will die here because he's not around. Well, that's ridiculous. We're ready to go. Madam, please be patient. He'll be back soon. Come on, release us! Are you crazy? - Release my madam, Officer. - We're ready to pay for bail. Okay, listen, this is an emergency. We need to leave this place so... Look, whatever it takes, what do you want? Just name your price, but we need to get out of here, please. Ada-nna, is that your voice? You... bribe? Uncle, this is different. Okay, talk to me. Madam, I understand. But the problem is... If my superior comes in and he doesn't see a man and a woman here, - he will dismiss me. - So your arrest is based on arithmetic. One man, one woman. Is that what you're telling me? Don't worry. A man and a woman right? He will meet a man and a woman. Just open the gate. My name is... Igwe Pascal. It is no more a secret, that I have an interest in Lionheart. Unfortunately... this company... has lost its vision and purpose. Its modus operandi is out of the '40s. Gentlemen and ladies, I am here to bring the change. Sarge. Salute! What is he doing here? And in my father's chair. Calm down, calm down. Mr. Igwe Pascal is here because I invited him to come here. And also because he... has something very important to share with the board. Shut that pipe you call mouth! These no other person that will betray the company except an albino rat like you. The board knows about the default on the loan. How could you keep this from them? How could you be so irresponsible? I... can explain. It's just a minor setback which we have under control. Unfortunately, Daniel has come to judgment in the person of Mr. Pascal Igwe. Now Mr. Pascal Igwe has drawn out a very generous proposal, to buy out Lionheart and incorporate it into IG Motors. A three billion Naira buy-out. I, for one would take this course of action very, very quickly given the limited time we have left. And, let's not forget the recent failures of the Obiagus. - I beg your pardon! - But! I cannot honestly say that I can... trust the Obiagus' ability to... provide the kind of leadership this company needs. I was calling you a scorpion, you're worse than a scorpion. You're a snake. You're a vampire. Gentlemen, there is no need for name-calling. I am a busy businessman. I haven't got time for this. The bank has given you two weeks. I give you ten days to make up your mind. Good day, gentlemen. I'll see you off as well. No, leave him. That's how traitors do. Sir, Madam. Please do not listen to this man. Look, my father built this company on the core values of courage and trust, and I implore you right now to trust me. My uncle and I have this under control. You ask us to trust you. Your family has been less than forthcoming - with the board. - Exactly. Look, finding out about a loan from an outsider is not encouraging. It's not. - We respect your father. - That's right. But... for the sake of the future of this company, We have no choice but to consider Mr. Pascal's offer. Who said you don't have a choice? We have a choice. Look... And we have just one choice, - reject his proposal. - No. - Refuse his offer. - No! Please, look, if this company falls into the hands of Igwe Pascal, I can assure you it will be a shadow of itself. Lionheart will not be the company as you know it today. Yes. So, please give us a chance to make things right, please. Please. Igwe gave you ten days, Igwe Pascal. - Take ten days. - Yes. - Ten days is okay. - That's okay. - No, Chief, even ten days will... - We'll take it. - Ten days? - I think is rather impromptu... And, sorry, but in the foreseeable future, gentlemen... So... You don't have to be moody at all. You have... You have done the best any woman, any man can do. In fact, what you need now is rest. Rest? Uncle, this is not the time to rest. - Why? - Igwe Pascal is a ruthless business man. He doesn't care about Lionheart, or its people, just its assets. If that man becomes the owner of this company, many people will lose their jobs, I can assure you. God Forbid! He cannot be. That's number one. - What would the families begin to do? - Exactly. You know you were telling me about your plans. I want to know all your plans, now. I assume that this one is plan one. Well, I was hoping that the BRT contract would go through. Actually I'm very positive it... Ada-nna, the BRT is like a a corporate job. It can't be relied on. It can go away at any time. Just like marriages of the past... where the woman is idle and eats up the wealth of the man. Unlike what is obtainable now. Anyway, you might not understand what I'm saying. No, I understand fully, uncle. That's why I work hard for my money. I'm not here to depend on any man to... Don't get angry, I didn't mean it that way. I'm not getting angry but I've dated men that... You've dated men that did what? Did anyone hurt you? Talk to me, I'm your uncle. - You have dated men that... - No, thanks, uncle. But… I think I know a man we can rely on. Are you sure? Arinze! Who is Arinze? Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry, where's Arinze? Thank you. Uncle? You know what, you can just wait here. I'll be back. - No, let me go with you. - No, it's fine. - He's alright. It will only take a minute. - Really? - Yes. - Okay. Are you sure you'll be safe? Hello, how are you? I'm alright. - Hey! - Hey. What a pleasant surprise. - Hi. - Look at you. I and my partner, we can supply you with all the vehicles you need. This is our inventory. You can go through it. All the model numbers are there. We can supply to you only if you can pay that 30% deposit. Okay. - Well, how is your dad? - Yeah... - Hope he's recovering? - Oh, he's much better. Thank you. Thank God. Okay, I won't, uh, take much of your time so you can get back to your stuff. Lionheart is in trouble. Yeah. And I need a loan. Please can you tell him to hurry up. I want to buy myself a new car. He should pay up fast. I'm not playing here. I'm a hustler. What did he say? Oh, he was saying that... you have a sense of business, he likes your personality. - Ah, thank you, sir. - That you have an eye for good business. Thank you. I appreciate it. We are in debt of 950 million. Yeah. I'm hoping to raise at least a third of it, and if I'm able to get that, then... I will give you 500. What? You heard me right. I will give you 500. You have 500 million just lying about Arinze, really? Not really, but I can always work things out. Are you serious? Of course, I'm very serious. 30% is a little over 100 million. Sounds too good to be true. I don't know. It's not like that, I'm just doing just a giveaway, because this is my first business with you. You need to be mindful of the money so we know our share. Remember Arinze has a cut. I'm aware. If I had known, I would have added more money. Because he's a nice man. That's why I'm giving it to him. That's giving a good price. You understand? Once he pays... Hey! Arinze! My God. Thank you! Thank you. I promise you I will pay back every penny. - There is this contract that we're... - Ada. Ada, be cool. Enough of all this business talk. What would you like to drink? No, I have to go back to the office, I'm on duty so... Like, seriously, you go to work like this. This is, this is a long story. Don't even ask. Now you look so tense. Arinze I'm not, I'm not tense. I'm... You are tense. I'm not tense. You're not? I don't know you, but if you like your life, you leave now. I don't... What are you talking about? These people are not what you think they are. They are swind... What do you call "shit" at your place? Kashi. These are two pieces of kashi. Very bad ones. The are swindlers. They are here to... I was here, listening to them in Igbo. You don't understand Igbo. So they are playing you in Igbo. - You know what? - Hm? I think I have something to get you more relaxed. Like, like what? Wait. I'm coming. Arinze? - Don't listen to this man. - Sorry. - You can see this man is drunk. - No, no. - Let's do... We can do this business. - No. Save your life. Save your money. Mr. Hamza. Please, just hold on. - We can do this business. - No, no. Look at what you are doing, all this stupid business. Tarnishing the image of the Igbo people. Why don't you go to the secretariat and look for a job? Change your clothes and go into farming. Agriculture is thriving right now. Go and farm. You are painting us black. Aren't you ashamed? No, no. no. Where are you going? Where are you going? Have you become a security man? You want to run away after disrupting our deal? Let me tell you... We are all Igbo people. So, Ada... Ada? You will have to pay us 30% of the money. Really? Yes. You hit him well. - Ada-nna. - Uncle, we need to go. Yeah, good idea. Remain on the ground. Stupid man. Director. Hello, sir, good afternoon. I was just coming to see you. Did you get my e-mails? - Yes, yes I did. - Okay. But unfortunately, there's little I can do right now. The EFCC is investigating us as we speak. The Perm Sec has been placed on compulsory leave, and between you and me, he's not coming back. So, as it stands now, I don't have idea of the fate of the BRT project. Oh, my God. It's only God that can save us from this mess. Thank you. Madam, I'm very sorry. My apologies to your father. This is the change we all believe in. Good morning, Ma. Hello. Onyinye? Is anything wrong? She didn't come to work? Leave me alone. I'm not hungry. My friend, I'm coming in. Mummy? Yes, dear. I heard you didn't go to work. I'm not feeling well. You're not feeling well. Onyinye called me. I'm so tired, mummy. I'm exhausted. What is really the problem? I can't get an extension on the loans. BRT contract is not forthcoming. And if this... Igwe Pascal man gets a hold of our company, everyone will lose their jobs. And they are depending on me, and I feel like I'm failing. You have not started and you feel like such a failure? Do you know what your father put into setting up this company? The challenges, the mistakes, the failures he had to face? And yet he made it. What is it they say? It's not over till it's over. Yes but, mummy, I'm running out of ideas. I don't know what to do. God never gives you a burden he has not equipped you to carry. What should I do? What can I do? You have your father's business brains. You're a businesswoman. Do away with the sentiments and the emotions. And get the job done. You have it in you. Dig deep and get it. You've always been able to do anything you put your mind to. You can do this. Thank you, mummy. You can do this, you're gonna be alright. Listen, get dressed, come to the house and let's have a nice meal. Your auntie Chioma is around and she's been asking for you. - She is? - Yeah. She came to see her husband. You know those two, they never stay away from each other for too long. Come on, get dressed. - Okay, I'll see you there. - Alright. Good evening. - Oh, Ada-nna. - Aunty. Ada... You are looking beautiful. Thank you. What? She looks tiny. Are you people feeding her? Can't you see food everywhere? You ask if she is being fed. Don't allow your father and uncle to tear you apart. Take it easy. Please don't blame anybody. She goes to the gym. Gym? Fashion. That's the trend these days. Fitness. I heard the first daughter of John Bosco is getting married next month. John Bosco looked at his son-in-law and felt he looked really skinny. He then asked him, "Can you take care of my daughter looking this way?" He replied, "My in-law, it is all in God's hands." John Bosco replied, "I have heard you." Let me tell you the truth… You don't understand what the son-in-law meant... The God he was referring to, was John Bosco. He will call him God-John Bosco if you let him. It's not a lie. That's young men of today. Saying it is in the hands of God implies it is in the hands of John Bosco. John Bosco is God. Let me tell you, that's what we suffer nowadays. When a young man wants to marry... he'll first ask around if the parents are wealthy. If both the parents are not wealthy, he disappears. He's gone. My sister, it is just tiring. It's too much. That's how a child will carry on something too heavy to handle. My dear, if such a man comes for you... run! Make sure your feet hit your ears as you run. It is not that you see a man and start running... because you might be in this sort of race and run past your future husband... then, we won't get to drink on your wedding day. How it is done is that, first, you study the man... if he is a reasonable person, you accept him. But if it's any of those men that sag their trousers to their knees... Run! Because these children feel like they are of marriageable age... "If a child tried to tie a wrapper before maturity, when the wind comes... It will blow him away along with the wrapper." Obiora, you have heard what they said. What do you want to do with your life? What sort of question is that? He asked you a question. So the music I am into isn't beneficial to my life? I'm a musician. You've always known this is what I do. Music is your choice of profession? You know you are Igbo? Essentially, every day you move around with an instrument all in the name of music? Was Osadebe not an Igbo man? Is it not his music you always play in this house? Chief, he got you there! You win. You win, before I choke. At least I have not gone to jail like Ada and Uncle Goddy. Leave me out of it. Obiora, you cannot go to jail. You look like a new baby's bath water. If you go to jail, will you come out alive? See your beard looking like that of Nebuchadnezzar. It will be the first thing they shave with a bottle. At least I look like my father with the beard. You know I support you, but I'm just telling you the truth. Are you saying I don't work hard? Please, let's eat, before I choke on pepper. Hi daddy. Ada, how are you? I'm good. How are you? Well, I am grateful to God for my life. But you see there comes a time in the life of a man when he decides to take stock. I've come to realize that most men invest all their time in matters of transient value, at the expense of what they should cherish, what they should value, like love, life, family. I waited eight years for you to be born. Those were years of trepidation. And you came and you became a source of pride and joy to me. I have watched you grow, and I'm so confident in your ability. The biggest legacy... I would leave for posterity... is you. My daughter. I'm not thinking about death, but... Marie Connely said, "In the midst of life we are in death," so occasionally when we talk about life, there's always death hovering around. You are the pendulum of my life. If you stop swinging, then I am done. I'm proud of you. You mean so much to me. Come on. Come on. Thank you, daddy. I'm proud of you, I'm proud of you. I'm proud of you. Yeah. Sit down. Please help me. Madam, if you want to go straight to Lagos, get into the bus. But if you intend on stopping in Sagamu, then go to Lionheart. This bus is going straight to Lagos. We are not stopping over at Sagamu. Why will you tell me to go to Lionheart and pay 6,000 Naira when my destination is Sagamu? Am I going to Lagos? Madam. Since you knew you were going to Sagamu, you should have come here on time. The vehicles that travel to Sagamu left the park already. If you want to go to Lagos, then get into the bus. If not, please leave. This is the Peace Express to Lagos. We don't make multiple stops. - Morning, morning. - Morning, Ma. Not now. Get the GM. I want all available drivers assembled in the meeting hall. Now. - Okay. - Morning. They're faster. We can't navigate those narrow roads. Ask the small bus drivers, they know! The small buses are always at full capacity. Our fares are too expensive. How much is it? Our big buses cannot compete. Not on speed, routes, rates... nothing! Our passengers are becoming impatient. The small bus companies are killing us right now. To reduce our rates, we should invest in small buses. Ada-nna. You look moody. Why? Let's just say... I now understand what you've been talking about all this while. Well, I'm happy you eventually realize it. The major thing is to understand at your own time. It's good. Where we going to get small buses from? We can't afford to buy any more buses at this time. Yes, we can't afford to buy it, but where... we can achieve it. You know. I talked to you once. Maikano Motors. They have been looking for a way to enter the East. Maybe if we push for the merger with them, it's solved. Maikano Motors is a very big transport company, uncle. I know. I don't know if they'll go with the idea of a merger. Why not? Listen, this is one thing that they have been looking for, for a very long time, to enter the East. Preferably with a reputable and big transport company, which we are. So... They find what they're looking for, and they have the small buses we are looking for, so... "Since the food is delicious, the soup looks good, what stops the visitor from eating?" Okay. I think it's worth a try. Good. I'll get them to set up a meeting and then we'll... No, no, no, no... - Don't be so fast, Ada. - What? [in Hausa "You need to take out the log of wood from the top before the one below." If you understand my gist. - No, no, no! - Odogwu... Nobody will take my company away from me. Nobody! No. It is a merger. Nobody's taking your company away from you. What is the difference between a merger, and what Igwe Pascal propose? Tell me. Well, Igwe Pascal wants to buy us out. And we both know that will be the end of Lionheart if he did. But with a merger with Maikano we can still, have some sort of control over our destiny. Chief, listen to what your daughter is saying. Listen to her. We have run out of options completely. They will not grant us extension on this loan. And no bankers want to give us any other loan as it stands now. So it's either Maikano, or Igwe Pascal, which we don't want. And, they are Hausa? Daddy, come on, this is business. Alright. What if Maikano does not accept our terms? You tell me. Oh, daddy, leave that to me. Leave that to us. "Throw the bone to us dogs and leave the fight to us and the spirits." We can do it. You have said it yourself. Odogwu. Yeah. ...such as for... ...we request... They have to apply... the application... Sorry to interrupt you. You remember me? The house with the pool with all the women. - House with the pool... - You saved me from being duped by those fraudsters. - How are you? - I'm very well. It's a small world. Hey, you know, I never got a chance to thank you the other day. - Yes. - I'm glad I have the opportunity - to express my gratitude now. - No, you don't need to worry yourself. Just do good to any human being you see anywhere because you never know what tomorrow will turn out to be. - You're right. Thank you very much. - It turned out well. Thank you. Sorry. Meet my niece. Adaeze. - It's a pleasure. - Pleased to meet you. So where are you both headed? We are... actually, we're going to Kano. Oh wow. I hope all is well. All is well. We want to meet... one business mogul in Kano. You know, Alhaji Maikano. Want to see if we can strike a deal with him. Have you met him before? No, no, no, no. But I intend to see him when I get to Kano. - Wow. - Yes. Well, let me introduce myself. My name is Hamza Maikano. - Hamza who? - Yes. The man over there is my father. Alhaji Danladi Maikano. Maikano of Maikano Transport? Yes. - What? - We are actually on our way to Kano. So you can come with us. I will make an introduction. - And I can help you with your bags. - Yes, yes. Wow! Not now, uncle, wait. Ada-nna. You will discuss with this man alone. I will stay on the flank. But uncle, we are meant to be in this together. I know we are in this together. But look, you are a leader. He sees a leader. Leadership is not easy. Talk with him one on one. The head of one organization versus the head of the other organization. Go, don't be scared. I am around. Okay. Don't be scared. - You're welcome. - Yeah, thank you. Do have a seat, Miss Obiagu. - Thank you, sir. - Yeah. So, how is your father? I've not met him, but he has quite a reputation. Well, he's doing very well. Thank you for asking. So what can I do for you? Well, sir, I'm aware you are trying to enter the Eastern region. Well, I'm here to let you know Lionheart Transport is willing to make your transition a smooth one. Really? Yes, we have a fleet of 200 buses and cater to over 50,000 people weekly, not to mention 30 years of experience that we have under our belt. So I think that... if there was some sort of merger between your company and ours, I think the sky will be the limit, sir. That sounds like a well-rehearsed pitch, my dear. It's not a pitch, sir. Then convince me. Why should my company match with yours? Well, sir... I grew up in a bus park. My father started taking me to work way before I could crawl. I saw people come and go, each with their own different agendas. You see, family is a core value upon which Lionheart was built. I understood this early and as I've grown older, I have realized that our growth is based on how we treat others. The same way you have, sir. Your grandfather built Maikano Motors 65 years ago. Then he passed it on to your father and now, you wear the crown. You do understand the importance of succession and longevity. You've done quite some research. Sir. Maikano motors is one of the leading transport companies. I mean with emphasis to the North. But, Lionheart Transportation is the heart and the soul of the Southeast. My belief is that... with your capital and our technical know-how, if we come together as one, we would be a force to be reckoned within the transportation business. And not to mention... most importantly, we share the same values. So, how did it go with my father? Reasonably well, I believe. Though he says he has to think on it, so, fingers crossed. He's never been one to make hasty decision. No, he said the same thing. But I really do believe that this would be a mutually beneficial deal if it does go through. I... I think so too. So thank you. I don't know if I have thanked you for everything. We wouldn't have come this far if you hadn't, you know... Stop. Stop thanking me. I know exactly what it's like to be in your shoes. Is that so? How come? You see, for starters, this isn't just a business for you. This is personal. This is your family. This is about proving your worth to anyone who matters, especially your dad. I know what it's like to be living under their shadows. They've done so much for us on a platter, and the only way... to pay them back is to show that we can actually bring something to the table. How did you think I ended up in Enugu, almost scammed in a business I hoped would solve our in-roads to the East? I wanted to impress him so bad and earn his respect. So yes, I understand. So no need to keep thanking me. I'm sure your father is proud of you. We have to be going. it's getting late and... we can't make the last flight so we have to check into a hotel. - Can you rec... - No, no, your things are in the car. I have instructed the driver to take you to our guest house. - No, please, you've done enough already. - I insist. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you so much and Alhaji and we'll be hoping to hear from you. - It's okay. - Yes. Alright, Adaeze. Did they provide transportation for us? Yes. It's taking us to their guest house. Thank you, Alhaji. Thank you. Thank you very much. Kola. Thank you. What's going on? Nothing. Honestly, your father is so stubborn. I heard you're getting better. Of course I'm getting better. Can't you see that? I'm not expected to die anytime soon. I'm getting better. The way things are turning out, I'll have to sleep over in this town. If you need a place to stay, I also have a guest house. You understand Hausa? I was born in Zaria. I studied there. We roamed the city. To be honest, I enjoyed the yoghurt... and the millet cakes. That's surprising. It was us against the world. You have to do something, because we're going to... O... kay. I promise you, they weren't doing that a minute ago. Ada-nna, why do you get yourself worked up for nothing? They are laughing. They are smiling, they are happy. I see that. No worries, let me join them. Right, I think it's about time we started this meeting. - There's no point in waiting any longer. - Yes. - Go ahead. - Three billion now is not something, you know, to pass on. Not so fast, not so fast. Get out of this seat. Come on. - Out. - Out of this seat. Please, sit. - Mr. Chairman, welcome. - Thank you very much. Chief. What a surprise, Sir. Yes, a wonderful surprise. Anybody who is on trial is offered an opportunity to defend himself before his accusers, don't you think so? Yes, Chief, but you are not under any trial here sir. No, no, no. Come on, I'm under trial. You... you accused my family of... incompetence, of ineptitude, and not satisfied with that, to make matters worse, you bring into my family this, this poor chap, this, this, this rascal. Chief Obiagu, there is no need for name-calling here. This is business. No hard feelings. No hard feelings. Pascal, you're an animal. Insult me all you want. But... it will not change what is about to happen here. My offer is up... and you have lost. If I were you, I wouldn't be too sure. You read it carefully. Sorry, what, what, what's this? It might help if you read. Contract papers. We have a new offer on the table. In the past 30 years, my family has... faced up to all sorts of challenges. We are faced with another challenge. The challenge, more trying this time, the challenge of change. This talks about expansion. You don't have the capital for that. You think so? Yes, I know so. Adaeze. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce to you the newest shareholder of Lionheart. Alhaji Danladi Maikano, and his son, Hamza. That's impossible. Really? We've struck a deal with Maikano Motors, to combine our fleet. If you look at the contracts before you, you will see that this is a mutually beneficial merger. One that allows us to explore and expand beyond the shores without having to buy small buses. But, most importantly, it allows us to retain control of Lionheart. Beautiful. Wonderful. This is... absolute rubbish. Sam. Are you still here? ...Get up! And out. - Your continued stay is an extension of your irrelevance. Could you leave, please? Beautiful baby. Beautiful baby. Please. Welcome, Maikano. Thank you, my brother. At this point, I must have to make an announcement. I want to retire from my position of MD and CEO of this company. I think I have groomed a successor, my daughter Adaeze, because I believe she has all the virtues required to run this company. In order to ensure that I am not inflicting her on you, you just must might put this to vote, if you'd like to. - Oh, yes. Yes. - But I recommend her heavily. Why not. All in support say "aye." Aye. The ayes have it. There's no "nay." Well... - My daughter. - Thank you, daddy. Ada-nna. - Thank you. - Congratulations. Yes. May I? Congratulations. Hello. Hello. Alhaji. I hope you enjoy yourself. - I intend to enjoy myself. - Beautiful. Can I get something... What is it? Okay. I'm tired. By the way, I want to change the carpet in that office. That burgundy just does my head in. - Blue... - I think you have an admirer, Ma. What? Stop staring, Onyinye. Hi, Adaeze. Hamza, hi. How are you? Very well. Are you... Are you having a good time? Oh yeah, yeah. I'm Onyinye. Leaving. Okay. I thought he's into hip-hop? Is this going to be good? You don't know your son. You'll soon see what he'll do. - My brother! - Oh, okay. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. First of all, I just want to say a big congratulations to my dad... on his retirement. And I have a special song for you... It's titled Obiagu. Wow. Open the gate. You always underrate me! Isn't it the same work we do? Yet, you ask me to open the gate. Are you talking to me in that manner? It seems something is wrong with you. Subtitle translation by
