Pharrell's song "Happy", okay, that song is played at all the kids' birthday parties, you know? - Mm-hmm. - But the truth is when the chorus comes in, it sounds like a bunch of moms on speed trying to convince themselves or something. For real. Hey, man, that song made money. I'm not saying it's not a great song, dude. I'm just saying it sounds like somebody putting a gun to your head and telling you to be happy. Yeah. - Cole! Cole! - Right here! What happened with you and Mae, huh? Cole! - Cole, do you have any comments? - Cole! Cole, do you have any comment about you and Mae? How is Lena? Who? The girl, the singer. Who? The girl who we had come in to the studio. What girl? For real? The girl, she sat next to you by the piano like an hour ago. We brought her in. Yeah, she was a good singer. What the fuck? What? Are you high? Hey, Cole. Hi, my little rose. What are you doing? I'm swimming. You want to swim? - Okay. - Okay. Rosie, you need to come back to bed. - Sorry, Cole. - What? No. It's alright. Good night, Cassidy. Why do you always call me Cole and not Daddy? Because you told me to call you Cole. Did I? Cassidy, how's the guest house? I had it cleaned before you guys came. - It's been fine. - It's fine? - Yeah. - Okay. Let me know if you need anything. Okay. Thank you. I think Cole's falling asleep. I'm not falling asleep. Come on, back to bed. Who's going to put Cole to bed? I will. I got it. Let's go, lady.

It's a rental. It's not permanent. Nothing is, right? Right. Um, you want me to take your coat? In a minute. I was just in this neighborhood. For real? When? - Few hours ago. - God damn. Okay. - Visiting who? - Some movie producer. Which one? What's the difference, right? Right. I thought Bub said you were bringing, um... Oh. Thanks. She didn't forget the box. Um, you want some? I'm good. For real? You don't want like a bump or nothing. Would it make you feel better if I did? Uh, nah, I just... I'm just trying to be a good host. I appreciate it. Is this for real? Is what for real? This picture. Uh, yeah. She's your wife? Was my wife. We got a kid together, but we're not together. Damn. She's so beautiful. Yeah. This feel good? Yeah. Didn't take long. Oh, no, that... That's not me. That's my crystal. - Sorry. - Yeah, that's pretty insulting. I'm a lot bigger than this. This is like one and a half inches. - Oh, my God. - I'm so sorry. Damn. Damn. - Uh, what is that? - It's, uh, it's my crystal. It's a quartz. You carry it around with you? For like five years, yeah. Got all my energy in it, everything I've been through. Feels like it kind of stores all of it and channels other things. Helps me manifest, you know? Can I see it? Um... yeah, you can like look at it. It's... It's, you know... but fuck that. Come on. You want me to do something or not? Okay. Hello. Hey, buddy. Sleeping in? No worries. I got Dougie here, too. What's up, broseff? Don't call me that. Big day today. Radio interview with Anne. And a meeting with our sponsor. I think it's over breakfast. Sponsor? The corporate sponsor for the tour. The guys from Glows, remember? They're dumping shit loads of money into that, so it's going to be a little bit of a dog and pony show. We heard that girl Lisa is going to be a star. - What? - Lisa? - Lena. - Lena. We should really jump on that. Do you like her? Alright, we got to jump, but we'll totally talk to her. Remember, 24/7, we got you. We'll check in after your meetings. Alright. Fuckin' douchbags. Oh, no. Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no. Fuck! Rosie? Cassidy? Nice million-dollar view. So much shit in the air. So, how's it going? I'm working on it. Yeah? Well, you got anything I can listen to? I'm working on it. Should I come down to the studio and listen to something? I'm working on it. Alright. Look, man, we're just... just trying to help. - Thanks. - Come on, Cole. We got you the nicest recording studio in Los Angeles. Frank fucking Sinatra recorded "Strangers in the Night" there, for Christ's sake. I didn't ask for it, man. I know you didn't ask for it, man. But we got it for you anyway. Alright? Yeah. Your nose is bleeding. For real? No. Fuckin' asshole. You know, the other day, I was trying to get my kid to put down his phone because it's like a fucking constant now. Then I actually offered to pay him to put it down. And as I was hearing myself say it, I thought, what a fucking asshole I've become. I mean, who am I? Right? And he says to me, "How much?" I don't know, son. Five bucks. He says, "Make it $20." Alright. You got a deal. I paid him. Just like I'm paying you. So I'll see you down at the fucking studio. You got it? You look fresh. I've been here for an hour. - I said noon. - No, you didn't. Uh, yeah, I did. When's the last time you were up before then? When's the last time you decided to stop giving me shit? - I'm not giving you shit. - Well, you are kind of. That's why I'm confused. So it makes me ask this question. Um, am I your boss? Like with your words, like, tell me. I want to know, am I your boss? - Yeah. - Yeah. So maybe you can act more like an employee and do your fucking job so I'm not late. Or else, you can go work at Burger King. Cool? Yep. Cool. Where's Rosie? She went home. Why is that? Uh, she went home because she was here for two days and they never saw you and Mae gets custody. Uh... I asked about Rose. I don't need to hear the other name. You got me? - Okay. - Okay. Because she can stay in New York for the rest of her fucking life for all I care. - Yep. - I don't care. - Yes, Cole, okay. - Cool. - I'm ready. - Okay. You ready? - Yeah. - Let's go. Let's do it. Hey, Ilana. What? I'm sorry. It's fine. I just feel bad about Rosie. I... I don't get why I act like this. Maybe you could try a little harder when she's around. Can we stop and get a new phone? Mine's gone. How? I threw it. You threw it where? If I knew where, then we wouldn't need to find a new phone, would we? Hope I'm not disturbing. - Not at all. - I'm Eve, Anne's assistant. Ilana. - Hey. - Hi. I just want to say what a huge fan I am. I've been looking forward to this interview for forever. - That's so nice. - Yeah. Thanks. So if you need anything, really, just let me know and I'll get it for you. I'll take a phone. Yeah, like, a new phone. 'Cause I... Uh, I don't... I... - I was thinking more... - Is Anne ready for us? Uh, yeah. Cool. Let's do it. - Just this way. - Come on, Cole. Just this way. Cole. - Hi, Cole. Welcome. - Hi. - Thank you for coming. - Yeah, thanks for having me. Oh, what, uh, why are the cameras there? Oh, we're doing a live stream. Web on demand. Live stream. It's going be great. - Did... oh, did... - Um, with our interview? Yeah. Did they not tell you? No. They didn't tell me. I... I tell you what. Hair and makeup will be super quick. Not a problem. I'mma just... give me one minute, please. Yeah, take your time. Take your time. No rush. - I told you. - No, you didn't tell me. I did. No, you didn't say it was on camera. You knew. I told you. I... I hate when you make excuses. - It's so fucking annoying. - I'm not making excuses. I'm just telling you. Telling me what, though? I told you. You didn't tell me shit, Ilana. Stop fucking lying! I swear to God I will fucking fire you. Stop. People are watching. I don't give a fuck if anyone's watching! Let 'em watch! You do your job so great, they should see. Fuck you, dude. You're such a fucking bitch. Call me a bitch again, and you will be fired. Bitch. You're a fuckin' bitch. What do you want me to do next for you? - Wipe your fucking ass? - Just do your fuckin' job! I am doing my fucking job! Babysitting you day and night, you fucking douchebag! God, I hate you! - You're fired! Fuck you! - Really? Really? How you gonna get home, Cole? Who's gonna drive you? - Uber! Duh! - You can't! You don't have a phone! Who's gonna get you a new phone? - My new assistant! - Good! Well, make sure you tell her where all the fucking pills are stashed so you don't freak out on her when you - can't find them. - Shut the fuck up! - Shut the fuck up! - Make sure she can fish you out - of the fucking pool... - Fuck you! When you're fucking passed out! - Fuck you! - Tell her to hold your fucking hand when you have to do fucking anything! It's like the part, I just don't want like the part in my hair. Can... He, um... he likes it a little messier in the front. Maybe if you could get some... Some product like, uh... Clay or something. The clay, like the molding wax. I like this. You should let them see your eyes. Hello! Hello, TV, I have an album coming out. I don't want to do this one. Need help? - Yeah. - Okay. I don't want to get your hair. - Ah. - Don't move. Okay. You look good. And I don't deserve you. Who inspires you? - What did you say? - Who inspires you? - Um... - Doesn't have to be music. Yeah, well, sometimes it's not music. A lot of times it is, but sometimes it might be like, you know, if I had my shoes off and I was feeling this rug, I'd be like, "Oh, man, we need merch that makes me feel the way this rug feels. Like, we need a sweater with this material on it. Maybe we should just sit down on the floor and do this. Or it's like architecture or something like that, or it's like the way the fuckin' air smells when you're driving through Joshua Tree in the desert high on mushrooms or something, and you're like, "Whoa, there needs to be a song for this." Like, music is like... It's like a bookmark. You can always turn back and remember that chapter when you hear a certain thing that triggers it. Give... give me a time and place. What's som... what's... What do you remember hearing somewhere that... Oh, like 10 years old, the first Blink 182 album when I heard "What's My Age Again?" and we were just like... Where did you hear it? Oh, we had waited in line at a store to get the CD, and we came back, and we all had to share the CD player. So each of us got, you know, to listen to the album all the way through. And the other group of kids would be playing like Halo, I think. And so we'd each get our like 45 minutes or hour, however long the album was, to just listen to it, and I remember hearing it, and like, yeah, I was like, "Oh, my God." Or like the first 50 Cent album, when 50 Cent dropped that first album, we were all on the school bus, and everyone had to have like... We... we wanted it... We all wanted to listen to it at the same time so bad we broke the headphones in half. This is back when headphones still connected. Yeah, yeah, yeah, each person got an ear. And so we each would, like, take it and put it in their ear so you could listen, and we were like, "Oh, my God, 50 Cent's so good." Do you... Do you think rock stars, rap stars in general are special people? No. I mean, there's something about it that's divine. - Mm-hmm. - Because what you say is able to reach so many and influence so many. But there's also something about it that's sacrificial. Like how when the Mayans used to choose the baby that they would, you know, kind of lulled with with acceptance and worship, but then sacrifice them, right? The same people that loved them and made them feel special were the same ones that threw them to these underwater caverns that were like... that became... - But they displayed them first. - Yeah. They held them up for everyone to see. Said, "This is our chosen one." Do you think performers, artists are always on display? Do you want to keep talking or... Do you need... Do you need to take a minute? I'm sorry. Cole! Cole! I'm against Shirley Temple shaming. Also, someone carved a dick right here. Inappropriate. Excuse me. Why two registers? Computer one sucks. This is really cool. Hello. Thought we agreed just one. Here we are. Just one. Where were you? I was getting food. You want a drink? You got a lunch meeting. Negative. What do you mean negative? I mean no. As in I won't be there. As in missing in action. As in... Cole. I'm not going to do this with you. Let's just stay. - We're not saying. - Absolutely are. - Can I get one more, please? - He's not gonna have one more. I'm not gonna sit here and drink with you and then miss your meeting because when you do miss your meeting and people are pissed, you're just going to take it out on me. So no. Finish your drink, and then we're going. Can I please have one more? Come on. No more. - I'm leaving. - You're done. I'm not leaving.

I thought you were, like, hooking up with her last week still. She was worthless. Okay. Like, I'm just... I found something today. I found something today. I went to a house last night. Oh, yeah. What house? A house where a kid killed his parents. What the fuck are you talking about? I was waiting in the car. And I looked over, and there was this caution tape around this house. Giant black palm tree over it. It was like drawing me to it. Like I needed to know something that was going on inside. So I... went inside, and I saw where they were killed. Cole, you could get into... I went into this kid's room, right? It was the most normal room, like games and... and a bed and... And there was a poster. Okay. I was on the poster. You're on a million posters. Not of kids that murder their parents. - Hey. - Hey. Nice to be back. Is it? Sure. You ever swim? Sometimes. Why? You want to? Yeah, maybe. Okay. I'll go try and find a swimsuit for you or something. Why would I need one of those? Right. You can start with your coat. Um... I have something for you. I don't know why I took it. I just needed something, I guess. Yeah. I, uh... I can feel that. You want to cut something up? Cool. You want some? Sure. You know, your crystal didn't really work. That's funny. Um, alright, well, one for me. And one for you. So, did you get any music in here? No. Really? Really. Oh. I could play some on my phone or something. Okay. What do you want to hear? One of your songs. Uh, absolutely not, but I can find something. I was expecting something a little different. What, you don't like this? ♪ And playin' ♪ It's fine.
