I'd hate to be flying in this weather. I am taking you to the airport, right? I was just joking. I'm heading home. Well, actually, I'm heading to a beach rental that's right near my home, so. Okay. Hey, honey. You're on in the car. Say hi to everyone. Hello, everybody. Hi! Tuck. Can you say hi to your dad, please? Oh, hey, dad. Your plane about to take off? No, no, I'm not gonna make it. Are you serious? Wait, you're not going to be able to make it to the beach house? Are you tied up with work? No, no, I'm coming. I'm coming to the beach house, but the flight was delayed. The weather is terrible, so I'm just going to have this driver take me to a car rental hub, and then I'm just going to drive myself down. I don't want you to drive. You said that it was pouring up there. Yeah, so I'm just going to take the Five Freeway. It'll be a straight shot down south. I'm gonna be there in about six hours, two if I start to hydroplane. Well, if you need to stop, don't forget about Coalinga. No way, no, no, no. It's been 12 long days without everybody. I miss you guys too much, even your dad. Oh, honey, one more thing. Please make sure that Mr. Hamilton fixed those leaks, because of this weather heads south, I don't want to be walking through a house full of buckets like we did last summer, okay? Yeah, on it. All right, love you. Love you too. Here it is. Yeah. Leaky pipes. My neighbors called you, right? Let's see the outside structures. Okay. So do I get a copy of this when you're done? Up to the city council. Here, sign this. Seriously? Come on. Half of this stuff is cosmetic and you know it. Since when am I not allowed to have a breaker box on the property? Not on the roof. I'm installing solar. You're stealing cable. Cable's expensive. You can't rent this property out again until you finish all the fixes. You can schedule a meeting with the city council to request some exceptions and some continuances. Here. Hamilton Beach Rentals, Henry Hamilton speaking! Henry, it's Lacey Samson. Oh, Mrs. Samson, how are you? It's hard to believe it's been a year, huh? I know, I know. I hope everything's good. Yeah, yeah, everything's fine. We're running a little bit late. Hudson and I wanted to make sure that you fixed all the leaks from last summer. Oh, yeah, yeah. I replaced those with copper pipes. My man Rowan did it. Oh, good. Great, I like Rowan. Also, I'm having a package delivered to the condo. Have you seen it? I've got a package here. Yeah, I got it. It's in my hands. Great. Just make sure you bring it in before it rains. Rain? Come on, it's not gonna rain! Really? That's not what the weather app says. Aw, nonsense. Are you kidding me? I should be charging you more for this weather. It's gonna be beautiful. You and your family are gonna have a great month here, I guarantee. Oh, that's great to hear. Thank you, Mr. Hamilton. Hey, we'll be there soon, okay? Happy travels! Oh, shit! Okay, bye. Shit! Son of a bitch. Help! Shark! Tuck, get my walker, will ya? Tucker. Pop the back, will ya? Every summer, we've come here since you were babies. I'm going to miss it. Well, college isn't year round. I'll be home in the summer. Yeah, but college and then medical school and then post-graduate school and then... Well, do you not want me to become a doctor like grandpa? I want everything for you and your brother. All right, you guys. I don't wanna make more than one trip, so let's try and get everything, okay? Mom! Yes, a new record! Tuck, either help with stuff in the back or grandpa, okay? You can't just stand there. What? Okay. I don't need any help. All right, luggage it is. Be careful. Be careful. - I got it. Hey, hey, hey, I thought that was you! You guys coming or going? Well, we're just arriving. I thought you were gonna be at your Cabo house this summer. Yeah, well, I had to stick in town for a big case. You guys staying for a whole month again? As always. Hey, where's my man, Hudson? He's driving in from San Francisco. Hey, Tad, is Becky around? You stay away from her, Tucker. I see that look in your eye. What, wait, what? What? She's my daughter. Tad, they've been friends since they were kids, ever since you got the condo next door. Yeah. Is she swimming? Yeah. I was hoping I could catch her before the Santa Anas kicked in, but I guess I'll just drive around a little bit. Listen, if you guys see her, tell her to take a ride share back to the Palisades house, all right? Not her mother's place. Oh, and honestly, you better think about going back to the city. They say the storm's gonna get pretty bad tonight. You might lose electricity, and what are you gonna do if you can't watch your precious sports? Heh, ciao! Come on, guys. Look at this, Lace. If the house looks like this... Chances are they never fixed the leak from last year. Enough. I told you this is gonna be a disaster, just like last summer. How many times did the electricity go out? Dad, just go inside. I've got to make a call, okay? Mhm. Come on. Ugh. Can I get the room upstairs this time? No way. You had it last year. It could be your graduation present to me. Really? Okay, sure, it's yours. That was easy. Hey. Hey. You know, I know I gave you a hard time about coming here, but thank you for carrying on this fine summer tradition. Your mom? Oh, she'd be proud. It's not gonna be the same once Charlotte goes off to college. It's okay. Things change. You adapt. It's not always about the place. You know, I know it would be a beast if we try, but what if we rented a boat next week, a fishing boat, just you and me, and we went out fishing just like when you were a kid? Dad no. What? It would be too hard for you. We haven't done it since- Just because I'm old doesn't mean I can't do things. All right, I'll make you a deal. Okay. If the weather clears by Tuesday, I'll go fishing with you, but I don't wanna hear any complaining, okay? Not even one. Oh, boy. You okay? Yeah. I'm hungry. Where's the sandwiches? Has anyone seen the package that was delivered for me? No, Mom. Huh. Well, if you find it, give it to me. Don't open it 'cause it's a surprise. Looks like Mom found another game for game night that no one will wanna play. You just wait and see. I think I'm gonna go swimming in a bit. It'll be my last chance before this storm comes in. With Becky? Nope. I thought you didn't like swimming. I don't like water polo. It's a big difference. Yeah, I don't know, Tuck. This weather is- It's what I've been training in for like the last five summers in a row here at this beach. With lifeguards watching. I don't see anyone out there today. I know the drills. Look, do you want me to do water polo again or not? I thought you were gonna join the chess club. Okay, 60 minutes tops. If- - Mom, I got this. I'm fine. Just leave it alone. All right. Steak or chicken for dinner? Uh, fish? That was the plan. See ya. You let the boy go swimming, but you give me a hard time about fishing. Don't twist my words. We're still gonna go next week if you're feeling up for it and weather permitting, okay? Oh. The TV went out! You know, we're here for barely two seconds. I'll check the breaker. Great. Thank you. Come on, Cubs. Come back to me, Cubs. Damn it, Hamilton! You said you fixed the leaks! Hello? Hey, Mr. Rowan, it's Lacey Samson, hi. Hey, Mrs. Samson. It must be summertime. Is there any way that you can come here? We've been trying to reach Mr. Hamilton and he's not picking up. Have you talked to him today? No. Do you know if he's still around? No, I haven't done any work for Mr. Hamilton in a while. He said you put in copper pipes. No, no. He hasn't called me and talked to me about that. I should have known, but is there any way that you could come by here? This month is really important because this is the last time our family's gonna be together before my daughter goes off to college, and I just, we wanna make it memorable, and just, everything here is messy. I don't think Mr. Hamilton would want me coming out there right now. Oh, don't worry about him. We're gonna pay you directly, okay? No, this weather's getting really bad. Look, I'm gonna pay you double. No, no, no, you don't have to do that. I just really need your help, because the pipes are leaking and the basement is flooded. I don't know what to do. All right, just for you. I will be out there. I'll make it my last stop on the way home. Hey, but you know, my wife has not stopped raving about those lemon bars you made us last year. Okay. I'll make sure you get some before you go home. No, you don't have to do that. Hey, it would be my pleasure. Okay, you've won me over. All right, girl. We'll see you later on. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Rowan. I thought you fixed the leaks. Wow, you've grown since last summer! Two inches, actually. Yeah, only two? My summer fling's all grown up. You know, it doesn't have to always be a summer fling. He's getting forward, too. Tuck's all grown up. Your dad was looking for you earlier. Yeah, I know. He's trying to get us all inside because of the storm, but I know that he's just trying to show off his daughter to his new girlfriend, so... He seemed pretty worried. Yeah, well, I'm not here to talk about my dad. We're going swimming? That was the plan, right? Well, the weather... You sound like my dad. I thought maybe we could do some other things. What, are you afraid of a little water? I'm half-fish. Come on. Hey, wait up! The pipes, huh? Don't get me started. Rowan's coming by to fix it now. Good, at least he knows what he's doing. Ugh! Tucker! Tucker! Tucker! Tucker! Tucker! Tucker! Charlotte, oh! I guess Tucker found Becky. Yeah, I guess. Can you go get them? Because the wind is picking up, and her dad is looking for her, and they just shouldn't be out there. I'll be down in a minute. I need to change. Come on! You're going too far out. Tide's too high! You play it way too safe, Tuck! I play it smart! Yeah, and where did smart ever get you? Ah! Cut it out! Tucker! Tucker, come on! Mom wants you in! Mom? There's a package with your name on it! Oh, great. Guess it did get delivered. The wind must have knocked it over. Thanks. Make sure your brother comes in. Tucker, come on! Shark. Oh my God, oh my God. Shark, shark! Tucker, shark, shark! Tucker, come on! Come in! Hi, Charlotte! Now, now! Where are you going? Come back, there's a shark! Tucker, come in! Tucker! You sister really wants you to come in. Becky, hold up. Is that a shark? What? Get to the shore! I'll distract it. Mom! Mind turning that down? Tuck, I don't see it. Swim to the shore! Becky, swim, swim! Swim, Becky, swim! Becky! Becky! Honey! Hey, it's me. Can you hear me? Hello? Honey, can you hear me? Honey, I can't hear you. It's me, I'm just, honey? Yeah, the connection here, it's terrible. I'm not gonna make it for dinner, babe. I don't know if you can hear me. What? Honey? Honey, just call me back. Hello? Hey, babe, I didn't know if you could hear me before, but the rain is killing me on travel time here, so go ahead and eat without me. I'm just gonna pick up some food in Gorman and then I'll head straight to you. I should be there a couple of hours after that, all right? I love you. Is that Hudson? Yeah. Where is he? I can't hear anything, okay? It's a bad connection. Becky! Becky, take my hand! Take my hand! I got you, I got you! I've been bit! I've been bit! You're going to be okay. You're going to be okay. Are you okay? Are you okay? - Tucker, grab that shirt. - Okay. We have to make it back to the house! Can you walk? Yeah, I think. Help me up. Can you get Mom? We don't have time! We have to clean out the wound. We have to do that before it gets infected! Mom, help! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God, Becky! There was another body out there! It was too mangled. What, are you serious? Yes, you idiot! That's why I was yelling at you! Wait, you guys, that's enough! What happened? A shark attacked her! A shark? A shark? Easy, easy. A shark? You're okay, you're gonna make it. Nice breaths, nice breaths. Oh, God, I think she's going into shock. Charlotte, go get to the kitchen, the bathroom. Get towels, rags, rubbing alcohol, medicine, anything. Bring it back here. Tucker, elevate her legs. She's going into shock. You need to keep her warm. Honey, Becky, stay with us. Stay with us, okay? It's not a good time to go to sleep. She's going into shock. Elevate her legs. Tucker, where's your phone? It's right there. All right. There you go. Charlotte? Charlotte, I need those rags! Tucker, just keep calling, okay? She's got blood loss. It has like one bar on it. I know, it doesn't matter, just keep calling. Oh, the package. I couldn't find anything else. Attagirl, that's okay! Tear the rags! Good, okay, Tucker, get that off there. All right, right here, sweetie. Look at me. Face me. What's that, Mom? It's a surprise for you, your graduation gift. It's a medical bag just like your grandpa had. Vintage, but it's not a surprise any longer. No, it's great. Thank you. Get the driftwood? Any piece of stick, a stick! You said you haven't been drinking! A little sting, a little sting, honey. Becky, what's happening? What's happening? What's happening? That's good, that's good. That means she's with us. What's going on? Adrenalin, blood loss. Well, is she gonna be okay? You're good. We'll take care of her. Tighten around the tourniquet. We have to take her to a hospital, right? Grandpa can handle it! No, grandpa is a retired pediatrician. What this girl needs is a hospital. Okay, everyone get their things. We are leaving and we're gonna take her to the hospital. Is that Dad? He's driving from San Francisco and he left like two hours ago. Okay, on the count of three, spin it. Ah, what happened? It was a shark attack! What can I help you with? It's okay. We're leaving for the hospital right now. You guys need to leave right now! They're shutting down the PCH! I can fix everything over here at the house. Mom, what about Dad? We'll try calling him from the car, okay? Good job, Dad. Let's get this tourniquet on. I don't think we're coming back. You don't need to fix the leaks if you don't want to. I'll be okay. You guys take care of your family and get out of here safe! Okay, will do. Go, take her. Keep her elevated! Keep her elevated! Keep her level! Okay. You got her? You got her? Damn! Yeah, go! What if Dad gets here and we're not here? We have to call him. He'll be fine, okay? We just gotta take care of Becky. Ah! Yeah, yeah, I got something for that ass. Ah! Is everyone okay? I'm okay! Don't, don't, don't touch the wires! They're hot! Charlotte, honey, try the door. The door won't open! Tucker, is Becky okay? She's hanging in there, grandpa! Mom, the doors won't open! Lace, give Charlotte the key! Maybe we can wedge it out! Charlotte, jump over and try and start the car! Be careful! Watch those wires! Mom, It's not starting! We need to get Becky to the hospital! I don't want her to die! She's not gonna die! Keep trying! Ease off the gas. Okay. It's not working. It's stuck. Come on, Charlotte, do something! Look, it's not stuck! The car is just damaged! We're fine! We'll find another way out! You got it? I'll be right back! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Shit. No, no, no, no, no. Damn it, there's no key! Everyone, you need to take cover! Everyone clear! Mom, what are you... Take cover! Stay away from the window! Come on! Come on! Hurry, come on. Okay. Get out of the car! Come on! Everybody out, out! Help with Becky! Come on, Tucker. Come on, Tucker! Help me, Tucker. I got you. Come on, this way. You need to help Becky now. Okay. Not today, not today. Becky, how are you doing? Hanging in there. Seems like the bleeding stopped. I know it hurts, Becky. There should be an ambulance available soon. Do you think Dad's gonna be okay? Tucker, help your grandpa on the couch now! Sit down. I got you, Dad, I got you! Here, here, here, here! Thank you, here. Dad, are you okay? Are you okay? Dad, are you okay? There you go. Okay, Tucker, I need you to get grandpa and Becky some water now, okay? Mr. Rowan, we're back! I need you to tell Mr. Rowan that we're back, okay? Becky, you're so strong. You're doing great. You okay, Dad? Mr. Rowan? Hello? Mom? Thank you, thank you, thank you. Good job, good job. I got you. Here, good job, Dad, drink this water. You're doing great. Tucker! You gotta see this, Tucker! What? Oh my God, it's flooded! Dad's gonna be pissed. You think? Man, this place is gonna sink! Mr. Rowan? Do you think he hurt himself? I don't know. Let's see. Don't get in the water! Just stay there. Grab the flashlight so we can find him. He could be hurt. You okay? It's okay, just breathe. Oh my God! Tuck, I felt something. Yeah, there's a lot of junk floating around. Wait. I found the flashlight. I got it. Ah, oh my God, look out! Jesus! Tuck, get on something, quick! Oh, it's the kids! Oh my God. Please be careful! What are we gonna do? Charlotte! Tucker, are you guys okay? Mom, it's the shark. I think it killed Mr. Rowan. Dad! Lacey, are you okay? What's going on down there? It's gonna be okay, Tucker. It's going to be okay. Charlotte, are you okay, baby? It's a shark, it's a shark. Oh. Dad, it's a shark. We're going to get you out of here, guys. Dad. Dad, I want you to go upstairs. I want you to get the fish on the kitchen counter and I want you to get your fishing rods. Okay, okay, that's good. Sorry, the road's closed until further notice. Are you serious? Lots of flooding down by the beach and on the roads. I gotta get to my family! They're in a rental down there on the beach! I doubt it. Houses on the beach, they're all evacuating. My family's down there, officer. Probably at the Red Cross Evac Center. They didn't say anything to me about evacuating when I talked to them. I don't know what to tell you. Are you sure I can't go down and make sure they're not there? You need to turn around. Nobody's getting through. Where's the Evac Center? At Clarion Elementary about four miles south. You know where that is? I'll find it. Hang in there. We're going to get you out. Okay. Dad, you okay? Coming, almost there. Dad! Charlotte, you can use that. Yes, you can do it. You can do it. Mom? What's it doing? I just want to get the hell out of here. Grandpa's coming. He's coming, okay? Okay, I've got the pole. I hope this works. What's that supposed to do? Grandpa? Okay, okay. Give me a second. Then you can make your way, okay? Just stay right there for now. It's caught! You did it! Now, now! Now, Charlotte! You have to move now! Charlotte, now! Wait for it to pass! You've got to go! Charlotte, come on! Come on. Okay, okay, you can do it! Come on, you can do it. Hurry! Hurry! Come on, give me your hand. Go! Come on, Tucker, come on. You can do this. Okay, you're set to go. - God, baby come on. - Come on, champ. - Come on. - You can do this. Fastest swimmer in the school. Remember that meet with the prep school? They won state three years in a row. Tucker, look at me. Look at me! Oh, gosh, kicked their ass by a full seven points, didn't you? Okay. That's right. Now? Go! No! All right, let go, let go. You okay? Okay, yes. Okay. You trust me? Go, now! Go, go, go! Come on! Come on, come here, Tucker, come on! Okay, dad. I thought I'd lose both of you! Thank God you're okay! Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay, Grandpa. You okay? Okay? - Okay. You okay? Let me take a look at you. You sure kept that shark busy down there. Was that Mr. Rowan? Don't think about that! You're cold. He's cold. Go get your brother a blanket, a towel, and, Charlotte, could you bring me back my oxygen? Okay. The phone connections are still busy. We need to get Becky to a hospital, and these kids out of the house before the water rises and the shark attacks again! You go. I'll stay behind. No, the tide's rising! We're not leaving you here! You can and I will! We're not leaving you, Grandpa! We're gonna figure this out, okay? That's the shark! The stairs must be flooded. Help me! Help me! Grab that, please! Bring it over here! Thank you! Thank you. Yes, yes, yes. Grab the other one, yes! Come on, Tucker! You gotta bend your knees, come on! Careful, careful. Oh! Rope, rope, we need rope! Come on, yes! Thank you. Good job, baby! Good job. Oh my God, what happened? Becky? It's gone for now, yeah, yeah. You okay? I'm better. I'm still a little bit nauseous. Okay. Stay warm, honey, stay warm. You're wet. We'll find a way to get you out of here, okay? Your family's been so nice to me. Hey, are the phones working? I should call my dad and tell him where I am. Here. They're still down. Keep trying, please? Oh, yeah, yeah. What are you doing? Are you all right? Hudson, what are you doing here? I was gonna ask you the same thing. What happened to your head? I was looking for Becky. Something flew by and hit me in the head. This wind! Well, if you're looking for Becky, and I'm looking for my family, why don't we look together, okay? I was just there. A telephone pole crushed your SUV, but I didn't see anyone. Come on. Where's your car? Up the hill, yours? I got it stuck in the mud when I went around the police barricade. Nice. Hey, do you think Becky might be with Tucker? I think so, yeah. I'm not ready for this shit, man. Me neither, man. You all right? Yeah. All right. Come on. I'm still not getting anything. You guys, where is that radio that one time we had at the beach? We brought it down there last summer. I think it's in the other room. It's in the drawer! It's in the drawer! One of the drawers, okay. On the right side, right there. Keep looking. Don't get distracted! I'm looking! Hurry! It sounds like the door is breaking! Found it! Give it to me! Come on, bring it over here! Please, please, God. Please, please. How do you get... It's not working. Mom! There's more water coming in! Here, let me see it, let me see it. If we can just get up over the hill, we will get out of the flood zone. I can go! I'll get help and come back! No, no, I'm gonna go. I will see if there's anyone next door, and then we can borrow their car. I'll go! No, no, stay here! Please take care of Grandpa and Becky! I'll be right back! All areas in the Clarion Beach basin must be evacuated due to flooding. This is a message from the California Emergency Center. All areas in the Clarion Beach basin must be evacuated due to flooding. This is a message from the- Mom? Well? Did you find anyone? No, and this storm is- Well, what about Dad? No, he's gonna have a hard time getting up here. They probably closed off this entire area. So we're just gonna sit here and die? No! Guys, I gotta talk to your mom. Listen... I'm not... I'm not running up those damn stairs to the car. You know that. What? When you get to safety, just send someone back for me. I'm not leaving you! No. You need to protect my grandkids, and the only way you're going to do that is to get out of here. Okay. Charlotte, she's going to make one hell of a doctor. Such a big heart. And Tucker, he's going to set the world on fire. Go on. Go on. Go on. Go on. Get outta here. I love you. I love you, too.

Die, die! Mom, Mom, Mom, please come up here, now! Why is there a shark in the house? Look, be careful. Oh my God. They can't be in there, can they? I don't know, come on. Let's go. Watch out. How are you doing, Beck? I'm so sorry about everything, Mrs. Samson. No, it's not your fault. You understand, right? It's okay. It won't work! Charlotte, just try again. Just try again. It worked. Hey, what about the smart watch? Did you bring it? Yeah, I totally forgot about it. - Yes! - Okay. 911, what's your emergency? Hello, can you hear me? We need help! Our house is flooded and we- Of course, ma'am. We can send someone right over. What's your name and address, please? This is Lacey Samson! I... I lost them. Try again, try again! Damn it! We were on the phone long enough! They can ping our location, right? Definitely. I don't know how that works. I mean, especially with how bad the weather is. Shoot. Mom, we have to get to the roof! If there's a rescue vehicle at this point, it's by boat or helicopter! We can wave them down! Are you nuts? We're safer in here! Guys, guys, guys. Get on the bed, now! Oh my God, I see 'em! I see 'em! Hey, hey, guys! Becky! We're going to get to you somehow. The shark! Stay on the bed! Feet up! We've gotta open that window. Push the bed to the window! Charlotte, can you do it? Quick, shut the window! Charlotte, Tucker! Look, it's Dad! Hey, honey! Lacey, Tucker, Charlotte! Dad, Dad! Is that Dad? Dad! Hey, hey! Dad! Hey! Is Becky in there? Becky, Becky is hurt! Dad, I was bit by a shark! She's here! A shark bit her! Guys, is that the shark? Hudson, shark! Hold on! What do we do? Listen to me. Strap your legs underneath the board, okay? If we wait a minute, maybe it'll pass, okay? Pass? Pass? Pass where? Go away? Where's it gonna go? Oh, shit. Dad? We drifted away from the house. We have to paddle. Don't move! I have to get to Becky! Don't move, man! Hey, look, the current is going to kill us or that shark is, and I'm not going to come this far and not get my daughter. Okay, guys! Do we have a rope in here? We need to bring Dad in, or maybe I'll tie these sheets. They can't use their arms or legs. It will draw the shark to them. Do you hear that? Look, it's a boat! It's a rescue boat! I don't think they can see us. We need to find a flashlight or something that will get their attention. You guys see what you can find. I'll work on the sheets. What about the closet? There's a ladder in there that goes up to the attic. You think there's something in there? We'll find out. Careful! What the heck are we waiting on? They're working on something to pull us in. Just hang tight. Nothing yet! Hey, I got some flashlights! Okay, bring 'em down! We need to get your Dad and Tad out of there! Come on! Okay, okay. We're gonna pull you in! Grab the sheets! Wait a minute, gold on! The shark is under you. Stay still, okay? No! Throw it out! I'm gonna pull you in! Grab on to this! Dad, come on! Dad! Grab on!, Guys, help me! Pull, now! No! - Dad! Tad! Give me your hand, man. No! Tad, Tad! Grab on to this. Please, grab it now. Pull it in! Come on, pull, pull! Dad! Close the window! Honey, Oh my God! I'm so sorry. I'm so, so, so sorry! Listen, he came to save you! - It's my fault. Just know that! - It's my fault. - It is not your fault! It is not your fault! No, it's not! Look, he came to save you, okay? And he wanted to keep you safe, and now we're gonna keep you safe, I promise you that, all right? The water's rising again! We have to get to the roof! Out the window. Where the shark is? Where the rescue boat is, so we can get their attention. We can't stay here. The water's rising. We can't use the surf boards because of the shark! We gotta go, okay? Becky, do you think you can make it? Honey, you have to try and leave. All right, come on. Here we go. Come on. Okay, okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute! Is that the attic? Yes. Okay, you take the kids up to the roof. I'm gonna take Becky to the attic! No, that's crazy! The water is rising! No, no, no, listen to me! If she bleeds in the water, it will draw the shark right to us. I gotta get her to the attic, then I'll break through to the roof. I will get through it, I promise you that, okay? I'll take her to the attic! I got it! Son, I need you on the roof. Let me take her to the attic, okay? I need you on the roof to help me break through to the other side. No, no, I don't want you going, don't. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. You sure about this? I'm sure about this, okay? I got you, all right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, come on. What are you doing? You're gonna need help bringing her up, okay? And then I'm gonna leave. Kids, use the flashlights. See if the rescue boat is still out there, okay? Come on, you're okay, you're okay. Listen to me. When your mom gets to the window, you help her up, okay? Okay. Promise? Be careful, and watch out for that fucking shark. Come on. Come on. Hold on, wait a minute, wait a minute. All right, we got her. Okay, hold on, hold on. You okay? Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay, come here, come here, get up, get up! Becky! I got you. I got you. All right, listen, she's up here now! Go on up to the roof, okay? Okay, I'm going to the roof. Hudson, the shark! Babe, I said the roof! The shark! Hudson, it's down there, the shark! Hey, help, help! Do you hear that? We need help! We need help, help! Flash the light over there! They're gone! Do you see that? I thought I heard people screaming. All the condos, they're gone! You think there's anyone- That was way too close! Do you wanna head back? No, we can go for five, and that's it! The call said they were by the beach, but there's no beach left! Let's give it the extra mile! Keep searching! If we don't find them, then we'll head back! Copy! Come on! Grab the flashlight and look out for the shark! They're still out there! But it looks like they're leaving! Hey, over here! Hey, over here! Over here, we're on the roof! We need to go back! Wait, look to starboard side! What is that? I think we found them! We have to get them! We're on the roof! We're here! They see us! They're coming, hurry! Dad, can you hear us? You need to get up here! We need to get to the roof. Okay. Over here! I don't see their light anymore! I don't see them! Captain, captain, captain! What is that? Flares are a distress signal! Why? Is that for us? I don't see their light anymore! They probably flipped. That means they just turned it off! Maybe they're dead! Or in trouble with the shark, I don't know! You don't know that! They're not coming! What? The roof is moving! No, it's banging. Mom and Dad! I have to find something else. Start stomping on it. Do you think that Tucker's going to be okay? Tucker, he's getting help. He's getting help. He's getting help. Find anything? Is that something? Here, here. Got it! Honey! Okay, perfect. Okay, here we go. Come on, you son of a bitch, come on! We need to help Mom and Dad! Keep stomping! I am. What is this roof made of? It's supposed to be this tough. It's on the beach! Everything in this stupid house falls apart, but of course the roof has to stay perfectly intact! There it is. Do you see it? I think so. Is it near the roof? Yeah, but it's just circling. Well, not for long. Mom, Dad! Did you hear that? Honey, it's Tucker! The shark is here! Keep hitting the roof! Okay, listen, listen. If I can't get this roof open, we're gonna have to swim, okay? Why? Because if we stay up here, honey, we're gonna drown. No, but the shark! We can't worry about the shark right now, okay? So, if I can't get this roof open, we're gonna have to swim for it. You got it! Mom, Dad, keep hitting! He did it! It's working, it's working! Go, Dad! Keep going! Come on, keep going! We can see you! Dad, you're almost through! Tucker, Charlotte! Dad! I can hear you, son! Okay, okay! Okay, guys, we're getting out of here. I got you. Careful, careful, careful! Help Becky! Take it easy, take it easy! Mom and Dad! Come on, Becky! Mom? Come on, honey. All right, come on, honey. All right, come on. There you go. There you go, baby, careful. Careful, careful, careful. Okay, coming up! You got it? You got it, Dad? Where's the rescue team? We don't know. They were here, and now they're not! They sent up a flare! You mean like a distress signal? Was it the shark? Charlotte, don't go over there! It might be live! Wait! Hudson, you gotta turn the power off. Hamilton showed me the breaker box last year. It's up here on the roof! Ah, it's off, the power is off! The roof is collapsing. We need to find a way off. Guys, we need to get over to the other roof! This one is going to collapse! We can try, but I don't think we can make it over there. I don't think we have a choice! This roof isn't gonna hold us any longer! We're gonna have the same problem. We need to get where the cars are. Guys, guys, the boat, the boat! I see it! Life jackets will be on there. And a radio! And flares! And something to kill that shark! We gotta get to that boat! Okay, listen! You guys stay here. I'm gonna go to the boat! What? Dad, Dad, I'm going. No, you're not. Let him go. I've swam this before. I can do it again. Let him go. Let him go. Let me go. Okay. I love you, son. You can do it. Everybody get over here! We gotta make some noise, and look out for the shark! I don't see anything! I see it! It's over there! Tucker, Tucker, the shark! Okay, move in, move in! Everybody, over here! Make some noise so we can distract that shark! - Hey! - Come on, over here!
