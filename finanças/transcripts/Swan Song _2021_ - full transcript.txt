I'm sorry to let you know that, a former client has passed away. We've lost... Rita Parker Sloan. Rita specified in her will that you were to do her hair and make-up for the funeral. Uh, first showing is day after tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. Ransom Funeral Home will require your services tomorrow night. (paper rustles) That photo is from a year ago. Perhaps you could recreate the same hairstyle? - Split ends and all? - He speaks! Oh, I'll... I'll never forget... how you used to make up Rita for her Christmas parties at the mansion. Boy oh boy, Patrick... you made Rita Parker Sloan the most glamorous woman in town. She should have updated her will. I entered her final revisions personally a week before she died. Rita left me as a client. You remember? I also remember you were close friends, - dear friends. - (sighs) (clicks tongue) I haven't pulled hair in years. Naturally, the will makes a provision for services rendered. (paper rustling) Rita wants to make things right. I'm retired. - (beeps) - (chair whirs) Let bygones be bygones, Patrick. It's not healthy to hold a grudge. You would deny a great woman her dying wish? (door opens) Show the gentleman the door. Mr. Shanrock? Bury her with bad hair.

(paper rustles) Your wife still smokes Mores? (paper rustles) (metal clanks) (lighter clicking) (exhales) She adores them. Knapp Beauty Supply, still on Tiffin Avenue? No clue, dude. Uh, there's a fabulous salon down by the waterfront, Dee Dee Dale's place. (scoffs) She's still alive? - woman: Dee Dee has everything. - Pat: Thank you, miss, but my client demands high quality beauty products. Like Vivanté. woman: (scoffs) They still make Vivanté? - (machine beeps) - 5.23. For one pack? (paper rustles) You can charge it instead? - You cash checks? - Lyle: Personal? Government. I know what you're thinking. "How could someone so flawless, possibly be on Social Security?" You took the words right out of my mouth. Two more packs of Mores for the road. - (machine beeping) - (clattering) Lyle: 21.92 is your change. And some tickets.

Is that what you do? - You are a beautician? - Yeah. I was. Yeah, yeah. I'm a hairdresser, I was very successful... - Oh! - ...when I was young in this beautiful town. I had the best clients, the richest woman. - Who was that? - And then... - What? - Who was that? Rita. And then, my assistant opened her own store right across from me. And took one of my most important clients with her. - That took some nerve. - Yeah, and then my friend died. Your friend, David? Yeah, David died. And I took a second mortgage. But, the nephew took everything. He got everything. I lost it. - What did David die of? - AIDS.

And there, was the fountain. Evie: Oh, is that what that was? My client, Rita, donated the tiles she brought back from Italy, to do her master bath. But then she changed her mind about the color. (Evie chuckles) David built it. Everything from scratch. - Sounds like quite a guy. - But he didn't have a will. Oh. His nephew inherited everything.

Pat: Mr. Shanrock. - Pat: Mr. Shanrock? - Pat? I'll do Rita. One condition. I need cash now. Oh, I'm sure, Rita would be tickled pink. But there's a protocol, Pat. I can't just make a withdrawal from First Sandusky. Oh no? Your brother owns the bank! We will be delighted to prepare a certified check for 25,000 dollars after the estate clears probate. - And how long will that take? - No more than six months. Six months? I'll be dead by then! Listen, buster. I know we've had our ups and downs. But like I told you, when your partner's next of kin retained the firm, to settle his estate, I don't make the rules. And I most certainly don't walk around town with my client's money. I have expenses. I have to purchase beauty products. Give me a loan. Some kind of advance, please. (groans) Would two tens help? The Ransoms will have Rita ready by 7:00 p.m. tonight. Please be prompt. You know Sherman doesn't like to wait. (indistinct chatter) (alarm blaring) man over PA: Please stop! Please stop!

Okay, darling? - Thank you very much. - Of course. - Have a wonderful day. - You too. - (metal clanks) - (upbeat music playing) Dee Dee: Oh my God. Pat? Is it you? No. Dee Dee: You look so... athletic. (indistinct chatter) Wow. Come on in. (sighs) Now, Tristan, check this out. This man gave me my first job in the business. And now he is, mopping your Vivanté. Well... he shouldn't have done that, but after all, you gotta catch this guy a break 'cause, he really is a legend. This is Patrick Pitsenbarger. He did all the socialites of Sandusky back in the day. That's right. Once upon a time. Well, I can dust that off for you if you want. Yeah, you know, I started off sweeping hair, and then, I worked my way all the way up to second chair. I was so proud when Dee Dee opened up her own shop. Right across the street from mine. You know, Patrick was always so particular. Pat: And Dee Dee was very nice to my clients. In fact, she took my best one with her when she quit. Well, Sandusky is... having a real comeback right now, huh? Maybe... My business is doing great. I know that. I mean, I've had to expand this place and make it a multi-service salon with all the amenities. Clients want craft, Dee Dee, not bells and whistles. No... God forbid, you ever listened to anybody about anything. (scissors snipping) You know what, they, uh... they've discontinued the Vivanté because it's... It's got too high VOCs. But you know, I mean, there's plenty of green and clean technologies you know, that came up after you lost your little shop. (scoffs) But that's okay. It's Rita's favorite. Oh. Well, maybe, you're gonna have to tell Rita that in Heaven. I mean, you don't even know this, but Rita kicked the bucket this week. My dear, I'm on the way to Ransom. No, you're not. Sherman is doing her, in house. Shanrock came personally. And he begged me. He begged me to do her hair. Really? In death, Rita remembered that she had taste. Taste or dementia? You decide. But anyway, you know, whatever you gotta do to feel good about yourself. Guess what, I'm gonna give this to you for 2.49. That's a dead stock discount. Oh, you don't have the money? Aw, I'm sorry. I can't give it to you. Because guess what, I'm still waiting for my last three paychecks. All right... silly! So it's... I'm gonna give it to you. It's just, I mean, I... I don't know how much it's gonna do you because, you know... all the bald spots. (phone ringing) (breathes heavily) Dee Dee: I didn't steal Rita from you, Mister Pat. You dropped the ball and I was there to catch it. (pants) Eunice? Eunice! (birds chirping) (dog barking) - (scrapes) - man over radio: WCPZ... (objects clatter) - Hmm. - (objects clatter) (hangers clattering) - You made me blonde. - Excuse me? I wasn't sure at first, but then I saw the rings and I knew. I came to you when I was nineteen. Remember? - Yes. - (laughs) I wouldn't think you would remember. I only came in there once. I'm sorry. Are you kidding me? You were wonderful. I had a young one at the time and I couldn't keep up with the blonde maintenance. Or the price, as I recall. You weren't cheap. - (clicks tongue) No? - (laughing) (sighs) Pat: I'm surprised you still remember me. Who could forget the "Liberace of Sandusky?" - Was I that butch? - (laughs) Can I help you find something? How about everything? (inhales) Oh! Give me one second. (footsteps receding) Ta-da! I've been saving it for the right customer. Try it on? So, how's it fitting? Pat: Not sure I can still pull it off. (inhales) Show me. (gasps) (music playing) Don't move. (music playing) The icing on the cake. You're starting to look like you again. Thank you, Sue. How did you know my name? You came for a perm and I talked you into a "Dorothy Hamill." And you told me that you dropped out of nursing school because you got pregnant. And the name of your son, is Danny. You know, sometimes, it takes a while. But it's all up there somewhere. My husband thought the "Dorothy Hamill" cut was too short, by the way. But, looking back... I never felt prettier. It's still in there. (sighs) I wish. I must tell you something.

Did you style her wedding? - All three of them. - (chuckles) (calm music playing) Grandma chose all the photos for her funeral display. (paper rustles) (sighs) She was...

(scoffs) Sounds like a nightmare. (upbeat music playing) I adored her. (Pat whistles) Nobody remembers me. I used to perform here... every Saturday night. Really? What was your drag name? Mister Pat. (scoffs) Must have been before my time. Yes. It was before you were conceived. - You see that stage? - Gabriel: Uh-huh. My lover, David, built that. He was, uh, very handy. In more ways than one. (chuckles) I sewed the curtains, and Eunice put the glitter in the paint. Every queen in town pitched in to open this dump. But maybe you're too young to know who Tim and Mike was. They opened the bar. There were so many people I remember. Miss Cheesecake, Dirty Ankle? And there was one very interesting customer. Harry. He was a truck driver and he came every Saturday to see me perform. "Mister Pat." He was very nice. Well, I heard that most of the regulars stopped coming out. But... But maybe your friends will will make it tonight, for old times' sake. (upbeat music playing) This place was family. What's happened with the crystal chandelier, that hung above the dance floor? It got old. They took it down. Pat: Huh. Another of Rita's hand-me-downs. If she would have known, what these crystals have seen. Oh! - What? Where? - Tonight's the last night. I don't understand. Harvey sold out to some young gay couple. They're turning the whole building into this straight, gastro micro brew pub. "Gastro" what? They are installing giant tanks to brew artisan craft beer. (inhales) But where will we dance? (sighs) - Here. Keep the change. - (gasps) Hey, big spender. (high-pitched ringing) (disco music playing) - (audience cheering) - Pat: I'm back.

Pat, you're still alive? - You're still sucking cock? - Christ on the cross, queen. A bitch can't even powder her nose without getting the third degree. Now, step back, lemme get a good look at you. You look fantastic. - Shit, I just saw your shoes. - (laughs) - (laughs) - Eunice: Oh baby, I missed you. I missed you too. Don't overdo it. Oh, I always do. Hmm. I heard the Fruit and Nut is closing. You going? I haven't set foot in years. Why not? Gay bars are so '90s. The Velvet Slipper's gone in Lorain and the bar in Mansfield's about to close too. - Our safe places. - Mm-hmm. I mean, who needs the Fruit and Nut when they can hold hands at Applebee's? (laughs) Besides, that place made me a goddamn drunk. Do you remember what we performed for the opening night? Oh, and thank God I talked you out of that Marlene Dietrich number. But your Shirley Bassey routine brought down the house! And you did both, the Peaches and Herb. - At the same time. - At the same time. (both laugh) Girl, you taught me everything I never wanted to know. (laughs) - (phone ringing) - (laughs) - You got a call. - Oops. - (sighs) - (phone beeps) - One of your boys? - Lemme tell ya something. The trade on here, would make your head spin. - Show me. - (phone chimes) Ah! (sighs) I do better on here, than I ever did in the bars. Yet, here you are, cruising the tearoom. (laughs) I like to cover my bases. (laughs) What on earth? What on earth are they doing? These daddies with their... - babies. - Mm-hmm. (indistinct chatter) I wouldn't even know how to be gay anymore. Tell that to your pantsuit. (laughs) - man: Great. Great job, buddy. - (sighs) (baby crying) Pat: I'm happy for them. Eunice: And jealous as hell. Pat: Those kids will remember them, long after they have gone. And who will remember us? - You left a big mark. - On who? Those gay dads should drop to their knees and kiss your rings. Which one? Especially the cubic zirconia on your left ring finger. 'Cause bitch, you know that's the only one that's real. (laughs) Pat: You evil bitch. I went to see David today. Is he still dead? My name was on the tombstone. Eunice: No shit. You paid for the damn thing. Today was the first time I saw it. Don't tell me, you are still mad at that old whore. Jesus, honey, when are you gonna move on? Why didn't you tell me about my house? I went there. There was nothing there. You don't tell someone in the goddamn nursing home their house has been demolished. It's bad etiquette. But you could have come and said, "Hi." At least you had a home. And a David. (chuckles) I had a house, and a David. And both are gone. But you are here. You're not gone. (door knocking) Eunice. (seagulls cawing) Eunice. And you old bitch, sitting next to me. (ominous music playing) (sobs) (indistinct chatter) (people laughing) Gabriel: How did it go? - I quit the bitch. - (chuckles) (exhales) Frozen fucking pizza lit the toaster oven on fire. But I extinguished the blaze, girl. - I am here, I am alive! - And did you select a song? I barely survive a DiGiorno inferno and you trifle me for song selection? (scoffs) Shame on you, Gabriel. Shame. Is Velma all right? One Coco Roco and she will be just fine. (objects clatter) (indistinct chatter) Look like you seen a ghost. Gabriel sent on me to check on you. (exhales) (sighs) I dropped this bitch on a Crockpot. It's the last night, I have no idea what I'm doing. - (objects clatter) - Take the edge off. (exhales) Gorgeous skin. (exhales) - Where are you from? - Hancock Street. - Nice. - (scoffs) You been there lately? - Been performing long? - Two years. I finally start to get good and they close the damn bar.

(exhales, sniffs) She needs your touch. (melodic music playing) Get Dee Dee back. Don't you dare. (sighs) Dee Dee would do a better job. Bullshit. I didn't know that you looked that bad. Well then fix me, goddammit. When David died, you didn't come to the funeral. And now you want me to rescue yours? Pat, for Christ's sake, I never even met David. We talked about him, every Friday at 4:00 for 33 years. You know, I don't do well at funerals. Really? I adore them. You're not making this easy, Patrick. I'm trying to make this right. I know I was your servant... but I thought I was your friend. You knew every goddamn secret I ever had. And you never listened once to mine. It was another world back then, Pat. People evolve, they let go. Maybe you should too. Have a fun funeral. I was embarrassed! Okay? About how David died. When I did let you know... how much it hurt... (sighs) ...that you weren't there. Because I needed you there at that moment. (sighs) Where were you? I left you. (sighs) And the whole town followed. (sighs) Rita: I'm sorry. (sobs) I'm sorry. (melodic music playing) I forgive you. I forgive you. You're going to be beautiful. I'll make you beautiful. Yes. (ominous music playing) (ominous music continues playing) (organ music playing) (gasps) Pat. Thank you. May I share something with you? I was 15 when Grandma Rita sat me down and asked me if there was anything I needed to tell her. We were so conservative. I was scared to death to tell her the truth. But finally... I did. "Don't worry," she said. "My best friend's gay too." We stayed up all night. She told me all about you and David. (seagulls cawing) Dustin: Even though I never really knew you... I want you to know you changed my life. (sighs) (switch thuds) (chuckles) Eunice: (laughing) Oh, baby, I missed you.
