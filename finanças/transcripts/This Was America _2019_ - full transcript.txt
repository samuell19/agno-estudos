- Under Republican leadership America is booming, America is thriving and America is winning because we are putting America first. Make America great again. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists. Two million people, criminal aliens. Predators, some people don't like it when I use that name. These are predators. You wouldn't believe how bad these people. We are getting 'em out of this country by the thousands. These aren't people, these are animals. That's called an invasion of our country. Build that wall! Monumental importance. Make America great again. You can't let these people disrupt any more than they already have which is disgraceful. Strong borders. Does that make sense? The best way to preserve the peace is to be prepared for war. Make America great again. Strong, secure border. Border. So let's put it all together, right? Thank you, everybody, thank you, we love you, thank you very much. Make America great again. - Why don't you start at the beginning? - Why should I tell you anything? - To set the record straight. I'd like to know how you got here. - Fine. But you should know this is an immigrant story, not an American one. - Stop it, stop it, stop. Hey stop, I am not, hey! I am not gonna hurt you, I am not gonna hurt you. I will let you go, I promise but I need you to make a promise to me too, okay? Listen, I'll take my hand away but no screaming, no shouting, no noise. It's important, Violet, okay? Tell me you understand, nod or something. Okay. - What the fuck! Who the hell are you? - Violet, god damn, hey, hey, stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop it, stop hitting me, stop. This is not a time to give a fuck about anything or anyone other than your mother and getting back to her, which I can do for you if you stop hitting me and start trusting me. Last chance, Violet. - Where the hell is my Mom? - I told you I don't have time to explain. - I don't even know who the fuck you are. - I'm David. - Oh, well hi there, David. Can you really get me back to my Mom? - Yes, I can. - Let's go. - I said the back door. - Yeah, sorry. It's been a long night. I'm all out of satisfying excuses. - Thought you were dead. - Not dead yet. - Who's your friend? - She doesn't know me or anything about what's going on. - Come on in, hon, you hungry? - No. Just tired of not getting any answers out of this asshole. - You sure she doesn't know you? What's your name? - Violet. - I can speak for myself. - Well then try it when somebody asks you a question... - You cut me off! - I didn't. - Well I'm Sarah and don't worry because I don't like him that much either. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Take a seat, hon, you want a drink? - Well I wouldn't say no to one. - Yeah, well you can make your own. - Right. Is he coming? - Yeah, he's on his way. - How long? - Mm, 30 minutes. - 30 minutes? Sarah, I've got a big fucking problem in case you haven't noticed the redhead thing sitting opposite you. 30 minutes is too long. - Uh-huh, still 30 minutes. - Sorry, sorry, it's just been a long night. - Yeah, I can see that. - Look, let me make you a drink. - No, I'm good. It's not really my life anymore. You'd know that if you kept in touch. - Yeah, well a lot has changed. - Yeah, a lot has. What happened to your face? - She hit me. - Oh, so apparently not that much. - That's not funny. - Move. - I'm alright, I don't need... - Yes, you do. Just shut up. - Are you just not gonna tell me what's going on then? - Sure. What do you want to know? - Are you my Dad? - No, ow! - Just hold still. - Then why did my Mom leave me with you? - Because she knows I can you back to her. - How? - You don't wanna know that. - How? - By doing something illegal! - So you are an illegal? - Violet, it's not as simple as... - I wanna go. - You can't go! - Why not? - Because I told your mother I would keep you safe and I'm not doing that if you're outside getting killed or arrested. - Well I wanna see her. - I know you do. But you can't. - Why not? - Because she's probably in jail by now. - You're a liar. - Really? And I suppose the cops that were beating down your door, they were just trick or treating? - What did she do? - What? - She's been arrested, she's been deported or something. She must've done something so what did she do? - She didn't do anything wrong... - Then why is she in jail? - Because it's all fucked up, okay? It's back to front. And when the wrong people sit in the Oval Office the right people like your mother sit in jail. - That's treason and I can get you sent to jail... - You know what, Violet, do it then because I'm kind of over all this shit! - Fine, they'll probably give me a reward for turning you in. They might even give me my Mom back. - You make that call, I promise you'll never see your mother again. - Hello, are you currently in the presence of an illegal? Do you have any information regarding the whereabouts of an illegal? We have a full... - I see you haven't lost your touch with women. - It's my first day. - As an America born citizen, I could under the 14th Amendment never lose my status as an American. But President Trump made an executive order that could make that possible with the removal of the state-issued ID bracelet. David had brought me here to take that from me and to plan an escape outside of the city. - This doesn't need to happen, David. - It does. - Do what you do. David, you owe me this. - No, but... - Do what you do for her. - Who the hell are you? Get off of me! - Okay, calm down! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - You waiting for another fucking terrorist? - You're a terrorist? - Is she serious? - David, he came at me, you need to call the police! - I'm trying to calm her down! - Hey, hey, stop, stop, okay? It's okay, Jesus. It's okay, this is Hassiem. He's the reason we're here, he's gonna help us. - It's true, Violet, he is. - So you're in need of some cash and a clean ID? - Yeah, just as soon as we get rid of the original. - You brought her here with this still on? - It's covered, relax. - That doesn't always work. - Please, wait, would you just take a look please? - Let me see your hand. - What are you gonna do? - Get that thing off you quickly. - What? The ID bracelet is what keeps US citizens safe! - She's serious? - Of course I'm serious! - Can you do it? - No! - Yes Violet, with that thing on you they'd find us in like 30 seconds. - I'll be an illegal! - Can you do it? - I can do that for you, are you sure? - No! - Yes, Violet, if you keep that thing on you never see your mother again! What do you wanna do? - You're a liar. - He's not, hon. You just don't like what he's saying. - Fine. Do it. But if I get arrested, I'm telling them you people forced me to. - I need my tools. She's difficult. - Yeah, I didn't notice. - She must be yours. - Funny, how long do you need? - There's a curfew in effect tonight. No praise for getting what they're looking for. - Okay, so we've got some extra time together. - On day one, we will begin working on an impenetrable, physical, tall, powerful beautiful southern border wall. We will use the best technology including above and below ground sensors, that's the tunnels. Remember that, above and below. - That's about as much of it cleaned as I possibly could. This was not an easy task. - Well it is appreciated. - It wasn't just phone calls, my friend. - I know, tell me, what about the clean IDs? - Well, one thing at a time. - I just don't want to walk out without anything on. That'll only create more questions, more suspicion. - It was Canada, right? - That's funny. - If you want a real laugh, let the cops scan that. - Why, who am I? - Chung Lee is a dead 84 year old man from North Dakota but the system thinks he's alive and kicking. - This is not gonna work. - Wait. - You think that's bad, Shanequa? - Shanequa? - You're a 45 year old woman from Louisiana. - David? - Is there nothing better we could've done here? - Best I could do on short notice. - We're caught. - No, we're not, this is just for appearances only. No one's actually gonna scan these. - You have no problem. You're the kind of dumb cynic who's managed to keep yourself safe. Off credit histories, off credit checks. She on the other hand, she's cursed. Any cut checks, any data processing, fingerprints, yada, yada, yada, you know the drill. Which is another reason not to go to the border patrol. Hard to hide, that red hair. - What's the limits on these? - Well Chung Lee has a limited, hard to read credit history. It's got to be low use cash. - Thanks for all the advice. - Well okay, latest intel on the Canadian border is your best way is to go through the forest region in North Dakota. - Anything closer than North Dakota? - Not anymore, your options are kind of limited. - That's a long way. Is there anything to help me? Timing, windows? - Well that's the good news. So there's an attack on the border wall in Niagara, a protest in 48 hours. So Homeland will be diverting personnel to there. There's a light watch on that state, so you can use the protest as a decoy but that means hauling ass to North Dakota. - Well, we'll just have to make it. - You gonna tell me who the girl is? - She's just a friend's kid. - Lot of trouble for a friend. - Everyone who comes in here has their reasons. - It's not like that. I told her that we'd get her safely across and she'd be reunited, what? - Ah, a female friend, now I get it. - Leave him alone. - It's something like that. - Sounds like a one way trip, man. - Yeah, I hope so. There's nothing but people like us anymore. You guys should come too. - Nah bro, I'm a patriot. Gotta fight the war from within. There's no foreign enemies, just domestic ones. - Won't see him again, so dramatic. - David. - No. - Don't be stupid. - I don't think it'll help. - I don't think it's gonna work out as well. - Yeah. - I'll be up in a minute, okay? - Thank you, again, for saving me. - Be safe, okay? - Alright. - I mean it. Don't make this the last time we see each other. - This isn't good for us, Jim. - An Amber alert. - Yes, the Amber alert. She's a US citizen being abducted by an illegal and we need to set some very firm tones here. - I've cast a net over the entire city, put the rewards out to the affiliates, my team is ready to go... - Jim, your department is to catch and deport the illegals and to retain the US citizen minors for reeducation and rehousing but this woman had a copy of the deportation order. Now this incident demonstrates a serious leak, probably from within your department. Now I don't want to have to call in IA but I will. - Sir... - This is a fuck up. It's yours, now fix it. Whatever it takes, your badge is on the line. - And she's just a child. - That should make it easy. And I want him brought in alive, we need to string him up as an example. You got it? Get out. - Can we talk to my Mom today? - No. - So when? - Not today, today we need to get a car. - Where are we going? - Canada. - Canada? What about my Mom? - Look, she's gonna be there, hopefully when we get there. - Wait no, where is she now? - Violet, hey, I don't know. Look, I'm trying to help both you and her but quite frankly I can't keep explaining things to you. - Keep explaining things? You haven't explained one thing to me since we got here. You dragged me out of the house while I was asleep on a promise and now I'm expected to shut my mouth and nod like some idiot kid? - Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what I need you to do! Violet! Hey, hey, hey. Look hey, I'm sorry, okay? I'll make this as quick and painless as possible. Just stay quiet while I do this, alright? Oh, you're not talking to me now, is that it? That's what we're gonna do, really? - See anything you fancy, sir? Good morning, young lady. - So this was the plan. We buy a car from a sleazy car dealer, drive north. Then the car dealer recognized David's status and tried to up the price of our freedom. - Now that is a interesting bracelet you got there. - Yeah, long story. - Always is, right, Mr. Chung Lee? - Yeah, so is this gonna be a problem, or? - Seeing as you need, as far as I can tell, to get this car as soon as possible I need that ID bracelet to... - I have cash, I have cash. - Oh, oh, oh, sure, okay. That's a different story. How much cash you got? - 9,000, isn't it 9,000? - 20,000. - 20,000? It says nine right there. - 15. - $12,000 if I can drive and leave right now. - I'm gonna have to check with my manager on this one. - Are you refusing American dollars? - She talks. Excuse me, young lady? - Sounds a lot like the enemies of the state living below us last year. You know the ones that refused dollars as trade and we had to report them? - Okay, okay, I think you misheard, young lady. Ain't nobody refusing anything here. This is a conversation between adults. - I don't know, she sounds like an adult to me. I think she heard you say $9,000. - I think I heard you say 12. - I think she heard you say 9,000. - I guess being a prick runs in the family. - Get in. - I thought it was strange that my mother trusted my safety to a complete stranger. And then I realized that my mother was much smarter than that. He wasn't a stranger at all. - Hey. Before you get mad at me don't you wanna hear why? Alright, you're not talking to me. No hello, I suppose a sorry isn't gonna work? How've you been? I'm good. No smile? Old habits die hard, I suppose sorry isn't gonna work this time, right? Come on, Tash. - Your hair looks stupid. - Okay, I'm sorry I'm late. - Today or 12 years ago? Is it certain? - Yes, it was more but I couldn't wait to get it. - And Violet? - CPS. Optimistically you'll get a review within three months but I don't know, I don't think it's the time for optimism. - They say, who's they? - I don't know, you know I don't know that. - What kind of a fucking degenerate decides to break families up? - It'll be okay. - Oh, it'll be okay. Good one, David. And they all live happily ever fucking after. - Calm down, Tash. - You know they have a word, it sort of became old fashioned, it's called a nationalist and I say really, we're not supposed to use that word. You know what I am? I'm a nationalist, okay? I'm a nationalist. - Thank you. - For what. - For helping me with the car dealer. - Didn't have a choice, right? - I guess not. Still pretty brave. - I can help you if I get to see my Mom soon. - That's very true. - Why the old car? - Old habit, I like these cars. - Why not get a newer one like you said? - Just habit, the cost. - I'm not a child. - Yes, you are a child. - Okay fine, I am, but that doesn't mean you have to treat me like an idiot. - It's the GPS trackers. - What about it? - All the newer model cars have their GPS trackers directly built into the engine. The government, they put into effect a citizen protection bill... - I know what a citizen protection bill is, I'm not stupid. - Okay, in this bill all the newer model cars had to have the GPS trackers directly built into the engine but the older ones just have to have them retrofit so they were easier to remove which we're gonna need to do. - Why? - Why, because it's gonna take that car dealer like 30 seconds to report us as illegals and then the CPL are gonna ID you. - Wait, me? - Yeah, you. Violet, as soon as you went off grid the CPL will file a missing children's list. You have that red hair, you'll be high priority... - I don't understand, the CPL is for protection. It finds missing children, it tracks murderers. - It depends entirely on who's using the information. - But its not in the wrong hands. - The right information in the wrong hands can be used to hunt down innocent people anytime and who decides that? - If you're so innocent then why do you care anyways? - I'm not. - Wait, is my Mom innocent? - Of course she is. - Are we innocent? - You're definitely innocent. Why are you doubting that? You must be the most innocent thing in the world. - I said I'd let you tamper with my ID bracelet, that's a federal offense. - If you hadn't done it voluntarily I would've forced you to do it. - Why didn't you? - Because I want you to make the choice, the right choice. - Breaking the law isn't a choice. - It depends on what law you're breaking, Violet. Look, you can get absolutely shit-faced in Canada as soon as you're 19 years old but in the States its 21. So if you cross the border drunk off your ass when you're 20 are you a criminal? - I don't understand. - I'm saying can you really be a criminal if they change the law tomorrow for something you did yesterday? - I guess I understand. But you having a gun doesn't help. - You might feel very differently if that's what stands between us and freedom. - Not everyone is out to get us, David, they're not all bad. - Violet, there's a price on our head, you and me. Believe me, everybody is out to get us, everybody. We're gonna need to do something about that red hair... - Touch my hair, I dare you. - My face is feeling a lot better by the way, thanks for asking. - Didn't ask. What the hell are you doing? - It was the GPS tracker. By the way, you need to keep this thing topped up. That's what this big pile of sticks is for. - I'm reading. - Throw that on there too unless its something worth reading. - And what's worth reading to you? You don't strike me as an A-plus student. - No, no, I'm not. Young foolish, I fell in love. But I do know who Walt Whitman is. And I've read George Orwell's Animal Farm and 1984 and Lord of the Flies and a ton of other things you've never heard of. You know why you never heard of 'em? 'Cause the US government airbrushed them from all the reading lists and all the libraries because they incited violence and civil unrest rather than just reflecting what was going on. Not your fault. That's why they left. First the African Americans then the Chinese then the Mexicans till it was just us left. - So you're like all illegals, hate America. - I don't hate Americans. I don't hate America either. I love this place. I left my own mother and father and country to come here. It was so exciting before you were born, it seemed like the land of opportunity and anything could happen. Like a movie, you could make your fortune. That's all so far away. President Trump signing executive orders to start deporting us. President Trump. I don't hate this place, I love this place, that's why I care. And I'll be very sad to leave it too. - You made me lose my page. - Howdy. You folks okay? - Yeah, just taking a bit of a pit stop, you know? - Bit of a detour for a pit stop this time of night, ain't it? - Yeah, well we needed a bathroom break as well, you know how it is. - Yeah, when nature calls. - Right. - Car trouble. - No, just checking the oil and the water. - You okay, honey? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, my boyfriend just broke up with me. My Dad, he's just taking me camping, he's telling me what a shithead he is even though we were together for like eight months. - Yeah, guess I'll leave you to it. Sounds like you've got your hands full, am I right? - You have no idea. - I do, I got three of my own. They sure do grow up fast these days. - Yeah, ain't that the truth, huh? - You know, we ain't all of us bad. - I know, it's just a different world, you know? - You sure you don't need any help? - No, we're good, but thank you. - No problem, God bless. - You're welcome, David. - Yeah, yeah. - Do what you do for her. - You're leaving her in harm's way if we do that. She's just a child for Christ sake. - And she needs a father! But seeing as he's not around, you'll have to do! David, you owe me this. - Fuck! Okay, alright, alright. Just her though. We're doing it together, okay? We run together, that's the only way I'm doing it. - No... - Hey, hey! Let me work. We go together. - There's no time, David. - Shit. Tash, no, listen, you're not thinking clearly. Look, I've got another idea, there's a lawyer, he's very friendly to the cause... - This is what needs to happen. - No, no. - Yes. - No, Tash. - Yes, I can stall them. You just take her to the border and I'll meet you on the other side. - The other side, Tash? This isn't 2019, you can't just jump the fence! - Think about this, the worst thing that can happen, I get deported and I get there and she'll meet me there. - Tash, that's not the worst thing that can happen. The worst thing that happens is they find her with me and then they kill me and they probably kill you. Then what happens to her? - David, do you trust me? Just say you trust me, okay? Just say it, do you trust me? Honey, hey. - Who's he? Mom, Mom, the door. - Yes, I'll get the door in a second. - Where's her bag? - There. - What's going on? Are you okay? - Yes, I'm okay, yes, yes. This man is... - We gotta go now. - Is he illegal? - Honey, this is a friend of mine and he's gonna take you with him... - Mom! - And you gotta be real good. You gotta be really quick and really, honey, you're gonna catch a train with him... - No. - Yes. - No, I'm staying with you. - No, and I'm gonna meet you tomorrow, I promise you. I promise you. That's not gonna work. - Buy us time, you need to buy us time. Get your bag, your bag. I'll get it to you. - I don't wanna go... I often thought of David as the guy that left me and my mother and although that was true he also had a life with my Mom I knew nothing about. It didn't mean I forgave him but maybe there's a few more shades of gray to their story. After all, he was still the person she called when she needed help the most. Why did you lie? - About what? - Why didn't you tell me you were my Dad? - Because I'm not. - This is my Mom's favorite spot. - Is it? I had no idea. - So we just took a random detour to make a random pit stop? - I just wanted to see the lake one more time before we left. - My Mom never said anything else about my Dad except that he was a wanker. - Well that could refer to any guy. - Any British guy. - Alright Violet, that one was probably about me. But I'm not your Dad because I was never there for you. So how could I be? - I guess. - Being a Dad, it's not about changing diapers or any of that rubbish, it's about being there, about showing up. I didn't show up for your whole life so how could I ever be your Dad? As much as I wanted to be. - She hated you. - She was right, I left you, both of you. - You're still the one she called. - That's because your mother knows I have a very hard time saying no to her, always did. - Sounds like Grandpa. - Oh God no, your grandfather, he was the most principled man I'd ever met. If he saw something wrong, he had to say it. We were once, me and your grandfather, 500, like 500 meters down the road there at a bar and we just finished a whole day of fishing and some guy in the bar was saying he caught a trout or a salmon or some type of fish that wasn't in this lake. Your grandfather knew that type of fish wasn't in this lake and he had to call the guy out from across the bar and this guy was trying to impress some lady at the bar and there was your grandfather telling this guy, "they don't do that type of fish here," you know? If he saw something wrong he just had to say it. Like why do we care about this? That was your grandfather. He did not care. Oh God, I miss him. I had no idea he died. - That's what happens when you don't keep in touch. - Yeah, I regret that. - Not keeping in touch? - No, um, the last words we said to each other were in anger. I always thought we'd have time to grab another drink, make amends or something. - What was it about? The fight, what was it about? - Oh, about me not being a good enough Dad. - Grandpa was always right, David. - Oh David we're still going with? - I won't call you Dad just 'cause I was smart enough to figure it out. - Oh, there's some of your grandfather in you, definitely, stubborn. - They're out. We're getting 'em out fast because of ICE. - It's weird to feel like a stranger in the country I was born in. More and more I'm convinced the divide was deepening. - Natasha Main, you're under arrest by order of the Department of Homeland Security for violation against immigration law. Furthermore, the court hereby places one Violet Main under protective custody until such time. Adequate foster family can take her. - I want my lawyer. - Ah, I see my reputation precedes itself. Where is she? - You don't have children, do you? Because if you did you wouldn't waste your time trying to get a parent to give up their child. - Get her out of here. - Go fuck yourself. - Lock the building down and find her, she can't be far. Get me a locator trace on her ID tag. - Just going for a cigarette. - Go. I wasn't really prisoner and I wasn't really free either. When I was younger I used to ask my Mom all the time about my Dad. Who he was, but it hurt her so I stopped. I had just about come to peace with the fact that I was never gonna know my Dad. I hadn't even seen a picture of him. So I guess when he came along I was a bit interested. I'm not really sure what I expected. He was a real twat. - Hey, you don't have a light, do you? - Yeah. - Where you headed? - North Dakota. - What's in North Dakota? What's up there, your girlfriend, wife? - No, family, I have a funeral. - Oh, sorry. - You didn't know. - Where you from? Sorry, too many questions. I'm being nosy. - It's alright. - You can have your lighter back, I should probably quit anyway. - What do you do for a job? - Hair dresser by day. - I'm guessing you're on a job opportunity. - Yeah well, girl's gotta pay the bills. - No judgments here. - I've been staying here the last couple nights alone and I guess I'm, anyway, if you can't sleep. - I wish, I'm babysitting. I've gotta be responsible. But thank you. - Best I get going then. See you. - Good luck with quitting. - Thank you. - Hey, you're a hair dresser. Do you have hair dye? Ah, she's awake. - Sadly. - And she switched beds. - I didn't like that one, it's uncomfortable. - I'll just sleep in that one then, shall I? - Where are we? - Not Canada. You switch this off. - Why? - 'Cause it doesn't do your brain any good, that's why. Now that you're awake we've got some work to do. - We do? - Come with me, need to make you a little less visible. - You are not touching my fucking hair. He told me that my safety and getting me back to my mother was all he wanted and this was the way to do it. You're getting it on my face. - Your hair is falling out. It's falling out, what do I do, what do I do? - Stop it! - How do I stop it? - Stop it. You're getting it all over my face. It's in my eyes. Stop! - You keep moving, it takes longer. - It's in my ear. It's literally in my eyes. Who cares? I saw a glimpse of it in his eyes. Sometimes missing pieces in your life turn up. - Did we say it should be blue? - That's enough. He isn't what I imagined a father would be like at all so I never called him Dad. This is so bad. He did a terrible job on my hair. It's here and here. - I'm gonna fix that, I'm gonna fix that. - No, that's terrible. - I'm gonna fix it. - No, no, you're doing it too short! Okay, okay, I think we're done, I think we're done. - I think you look great. I'm serious, there's a phrase in England saying if you're lucky enough to be born English you basically won the lottery in life. - Sounds like a pretty old saying to me. - I'm not saying it isn't. It hasn't been helping me recently. It is a phrase. - Why don't you just pretend to be mute? No, I'm serious. I can be your translator. - Oh, you're gonna speak on my behalf? - Mm-hmm, yeah. - Yeah, no thanks. - Why don't you just speak with an American accent? - I've tried a few times but I can't. - You can't? - I can't, it's hard. - No, it's not! - Yes it is, you couldn't do my accent. - I can teach you. - Alright, you can do my accent. - Mm-hmm. - We'll discuss it in the car. - Is that a yes? - It's a we'll discuss it in the car, that's what it is. - Okay. - You need to go to sleep. We're gonna be in the car very early and you can't keep eating chips before bed. - No, David, I'm not done! - You need sleep, not junk food. - Just stick with us, don't believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. The only people giving a platform to these hate groups is the media itself and the fake news. A few days ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people and they are, they are the enemy of the people. And just remember, what you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening. - Shh, shh. Hi, can I help you? - You've got 30. - Sorry? - You have 30 minutes, you better hurry up. They're coming. - Who's they? - Immigration. Good luck. - Breakfast? - They go into these nests like its a day at the office. I don't wanna do it, you don't wanna do it. You don't wanna do it, you, I think that one does wanna do it. I think he does wanna do it actually. - Sarah? What do you want? - Where is she? - Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. No? - No, not good. - Really? - Mm-mm. - I though it was pretty decent for a first attempt. - It doesn't matter if its your first attempt or your thousandth, it matters if it's good enough. - Why do you so care what people think? - I have to care. We have to care, we don't have a choice. - We always have a choice. - Depends on what the consequences are. - Aren't you a bit young to be that cynical? - Okay, let's go. - What am I gonna say, hey, would you like a glass of water? Possibly a... Hey, what? What, is that bad? Come on, it's hard. I don't think it was that bad. - You're gonna get killed if you talk like that. - Come on. We're overthinking this. I think my own accent is fine. In fact, everything sounds better in my own accent. Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. Perhaps you'd like a glass of water or a cup of tea? - You're an asshole. - That mean you're not talking to me anymore then? - It's important, David. - Alright, yes it is. Look, I'll practice, I promise, okay? - Okay. - You have my word. Trust me? - Do I have a choice? - Yes, though I'm probably in the wrong country to say that though. - How so? - Well because the illusion of choice isn't a choice... - Here we go again, the system is rigged. - It is, you know who started that? President Trump, what a cunt. - David, you can't say that. - Yes you can. - You can't say that. - Why not? - Because it's treason. - It wasn't that long ago you could say anything you wanted. - You're sounding like a terrorist. You're an illegal, not a terrorist. - I just think people should be able to say whatever they want. - David, hate speech. - It's not hate speech, it's freedom of speech, a right afforded to everybody. So why can't I say it? - 'Cause you're an illegal. - So you can say it? - I don't wanna be an illegal. - We're hoping we can cross the border to see your Mom. - That's different. - Why? - Because I have to see my Mom. - Well the system you believe in so much is gonna make you an illegal for doing just that. What a great system, huh? - I'm sure they had a reason. - You know why I'm talking to you like this? - Why? - Because I have to take you across because the government wants to keep you here in this country till you're 18 years old. Did you know that? That's why we're doing this. Your mother can't voluntarily take you across and the US won't deport one of their own citizens anymore, that's you. - They have a good reason. - Right, you let me know when in history ever it's been a good idea for governments to separate families. So now if you think of a reason you tell me. I'd be interested to know what that might be. - Looks painful. - I told you, I never saw her. - And I told you, we tracked her ID bracelet here. - Stop it! Look, she was here looking for a ride out of town. - Why here? - I don't know. - Lies. I've been doing this a while. You know what has a 100% success rate? Five. Four. Three. Two. - Stop, stop, stop, please, you monster. - Maybe now you see how serious I am. Maybe we can talk. - Hey, do you guys have a washroom? - Yeah, it's just down there to the right. - Thanks. - Is that everything? - Actually, can I get another one of those? - Yeah, for sure. - Thanks. - $21.30 please. - That should be good, here you are. - Thank you. - Keep the change. - Are you kidding me? - What? - You're gonna be sick. - No, I'm not. - You're gonna be sick. - I'm not gonna be sick. - You are. - Alright, can I say I told you so? - No, leave me alone. - How do you feel? - Hungry. - You're hungry, are you serious? - Yep. - Here. So, you wanna risk the accent or... - No, no, no, I am not dying on an empty stomach. - Dying? - What do you want? - I think I'm gonna have a burger. Can't go wrong with a burger, right? Cheeseburger. What are you doing? - Wait. - Why do I feel like this might be at my detriment? - It's for you, dummy, I solved the accent problem. - Didn't we veto the mute idea? - Did we? - Hey guys, what can I get you? Some coffee, food? Oh, okay. I need to know what you want to eat. - It's okay, I can order for him. - Thank God, okay. - Cheeseburger. - Yeah. - Fries. - Yeah. - And extra large onion rings. And he'll have, he'll have the salad, he's vegan. - Okay, is that it? - Yeah, that's all, thank you. - Thank you. It's coming right up. - You're mute, don't blow it. - When that burger comes I'm having it. - I'm not vegan. - Just 'cause I stole your french fries? - Payback. - Here we go. - Thank you. - Enjoy. - Thank you. - Hey, could you pass me the silverware. - Hey! You're mute, not deaf, asshole. - I need to make a phone call from that phone box outside. - When? - Now. Don't talk to anybody. - I know the spiel by now, David. - John, it's David. - This isn't on, David. What the hell are you thinking? Do you know the sentence for abduction? - It's not abduction! - I just couldn't believe it. Are you out of your fucking mind? - I didn't have a choice. - You didn't have a choice? - John, what do you want me to do? - I'd say turn yourself in. Abduction is a five year minimum. But now, this is abduction of a US citizen, David. That's death. You crossed the line even I can argue out of. - Well that settles it then. - I spoke with the district attorney... - John, stop, stop, stop. How's Natasha? - Look, she's in quarantine right now. If not tomorrow she'll be deported the following day. - Is she okay? - She's stressed, as you can expect, she's okay. - Will you tell her we're okay? - Where are you, David? At least let me know... - John, John, stop, stop, will you just please tell her that we're okay, me and Violet. - You know I can't. Where are you? - So we need to go. I just spoke to your Mom's lawyer. - You talked to my Mom? - No, not your Mom, a friend of your Mom's. She's okay but we do need to go. Like right now. - So, how is everything? - I knew we weren't safe until we got over the border but I still felt a little safer when he was around. Maybe he was afraid of what my mother would do to him if he let something happen to me. Maybe he was a bit of an anarchist and getting me out of the country was his way of rebelling. Or maybe I was the missing piece in his life just as he had been the missing piece in mine. - So, what do you think, time to try out the new accent? - You already know what I think. - No? - No. - How can I help you? - We need a room. - How old are you, young lady? You don't speak, at all? - Do you have a room or not? - How many you need? - Just one. - Check. I got one but its only got one bed. - That's fine. - Is it just you and your Dad? - Yeah, just me and my Dad. - You don't understand sign language? - What did you say? - ID. - Oh, yeah, yeah, of course. - It's room 115. - Thanks. - Down to the left. - Threw me off with that guy knowing sign language. - If it was sign language, was that for real? - I don't know, I don't know sign language. - I'm just worried he was testing us or something. - Yeah, I don't really like it here. You think we can move soon? - We don't have to stay long but you should probably sleep for a few hours. - What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna take a shower. - Yeah, not if I beat you to it. - As a candidate for President, I promised I would fix this crisis and I intend to keep that promise one way or the other. - Hi. - Hi. - Good evening, ma'am. - You take anything in there? - No, just black, thank you. - Hungry? - Oh no thank you, just the coffee will be fine. I'm wondering if you can help me out with something. - I can try. - I'm looking for a young girl, About 13 years old, red hair, five foot, you seen anybody like that around? - Doesn't ring a bell. - Maybe you can take a look at this. Her mother's very worried. - Yeah, she was in here, I don't know, two hours ago. - Was she alone? - Her hair's not red though, it's more like brunette. The guy, maybe early 40's, dark hair, beard. Real quiet like, you know, kind of like a special kind of way. - Which way did they go? - They went that way. - What's up this road? - Not much. Randy's farm and the Canadian border. Can I do something to help? - You've already helped more than you know, ma'am. Thank you kindly. - Don't worry. - You don't have to do this, boy. - And neither did you. Violet, Violet, grab your things. I need you to go to the car. Start the engine and turn the radio up really, really loud. Can you do that? Do you know how to start it? - Yeah. - I'll be there in a minute. Did you make a call? Did you report us? - I didn't call nobody, dumb-ass. Yeah, I'm at the Holiday Motel, I think I seen that girl you were looking for. How much is that reward? Ask what you can do for your country. - Stop. - You can tell me, I know you're just protecting your girl. You need to go somewhere. - Shut up. - British, right? - So? - Old allies, we got a special relationship. I ain't got no beef with you. I'm just doing my duty as an American. - What about your duty to another human being? - What's the difference? - Would you look at that? - Are you gonna shoot me? Look, look, I won't tell nobody. I was worried cops were gonna come around asking questions. Listen, I just wanna move on, get going, I won't tell nobody. You don't have to do this. - Is he dead? - Who? - That guy. Did you kill him? - What do you think? - I don't know. - There are sometimes good people that do bad things for very good reasons like looking out for the greater good or protecting an innocent girl. It's not so black and white, you know. - Are you a good person? - No, I'm not a good person but I really want to be one. - You'll remember the motel manager, an unarmed man and your father shot him right in the face. - I guess I never knew what he was capable of. I mean, I knew that he was an illegal to start with and I knew he carried a gun but I never knew where the edge was with him. I never wanted him to do anything illegal, anything violent, out of hand, at least not in my path. You know, I never heard a gunshot. Is that why you left Mom? - No, it's not. Do you believe in forgiveness? - Sure. What have you got if you can't forgive? - Well, I'm kind of hoping that if I could just get you back to your Mom I'll have done one decent thing by you guys. Whilst that doesn't make up for everything in the past maybe it makes a slightly better future. - Choices. - America's not all that bad. The people in it, they want to protect themselves. - Yeah, that's the individual though. When you look into it, the eyes of any one person you see goodness, you see the reason that they're fighting for the thing they're fighting for, that's just compassion, empathy and all that good stuff. But it's groups you gotta be careful of. The mob mentality, you know? That's when it gets dangerous, red team, blue team, why should I bother? Hey, my bank balance is effected. That's where stuff starts to go real wrong. - You need both sides of it though, right? - Yeah, but you can't go too far one way. You're too young to remember President Trump signing a load of executive orders. He had a racist, intolerant agenda, a loyal band of supporters, idiots, they'd have followed him to hell and back if he'd asked them. I think we did 'cause that's where we are now. - He never asked me anything. It's like he always knew what to do. And he told me what to do, what to say, what to think. It's funny, all these years I wanted a Dad and then he finally shows up and I found myself not liking the authority he thinks he has over me. He probably didn't even think about it. I wasn't thinking either. It just felt right. I knew I had to get back to my mother. He was my best shot. - They go in and they, in a relatively nice way, I want to say that, relatively nice. They get 'em out. They put 'em in the paddy wagons and they get 'em out of the country. They bring 'em back home or worse. - Oh, thank God. That limey fucking... Hi, yeah, I'm at the Holiday Motel. I think I seen that girl you're looking for. How much is that reward? - Why didn't he kill you? - I don't know. I can promise I'm gonna catch him and I'm gonna kill him. - You and me both. - I can close up now. We can go together, do it quickly. Share the reward, 50-50. - Chad Walker, age 35, suspected domestic terrorist ties, wanted. - 60-40, two heads are better than one. - The reward for bringing in murder one is triple that. - It was all a long time ago. - That gives me all the backup I need. - Jim, where are you? It's been 24 hours, call in. - How far to the motel? - Ah, no motel this evening. - Where are we staying? - I'm glad you asked. - Oh, I am not staying out here. - Well we have no choice, we're too far north. - You said we were nearly there. - Well we're 20 clicks from the border but we're past every motel. We can't actually cross till midnight. - Midnight? - At one minute past midnight you can see your Mom, give her a big hug, give her a big... - What? - It's okay. It's okay. - You're trespassing! - Yeah sorry, our car broke down so me and my daughter... - Trespassers will be shot. - No problem, we'll get out of your hair. Get in the car, go, go. No problem. - Leave the girl, David. - I can't do that. - David, leave the girl. - What are we gonna do? - It's okay, give me the bag. - Why, where are we going? - We're gonna go 20 K due north, that's right behind me. - Don't leave me, I can't go without you, I can't go without you, no, no. - Yes you can, yes you can. You're gonna see your Mom and she's gonna be so, so happy to see you. Everything's gonna be alright. There's 20 K. - Afraid it's a little late for a deal, David. - I know this so the deal wasn't for me, it's for the girl. - The state wants the girl. - 20 grand says she went missing, disappeared or whatever you want and I'll come quietly. - Can't risk you talking later. I might end up in a whole lot of trouble. - Please. - It's out of my hands the minute you murdered the motel manager. - I didn't murder anybody. - I know that, but the department doesn't. We weren't sure you even had her still with you. - Had who? I don't know who you're talking about. - You were never gonna make the border, David. - I don't know, I have one more thing to try. - Don't do it. You'll never get a shot off. David, this ends one way, not yours. Don't be a fool. - Are you a father? - Yeah, I'm a father. That's why I'm here. - Yeah, me too. - Hey honey, are you okay? - I'm fine. - Where are you going, do you want a ride? - No, I'm fine. - It's just a few miles left. It's Violet, right? - How'd you know my name? - I gave your Dad hair dye at the motel. Why don't you get in? Where are you headed? - North Dakota. - Girl's gotta pay the bills. Hey, seat belt on, gotta be safe. - I still felt a little safer when he was around. - Let's get you back to where you belong. - Maybe he was afraid of what my mother would do to him if he let something happen to me. Maybe he was a bit of an anarchist and getting me out of the country was his way of rebelling. Or maybe I was the missing piece in his life. Just as he had been the missing piece in mine. My father did save me but it never got me back to my mother. - Oh shut up, silly woman, said the reptile with a grin. You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in. Does that makes sense to anybody? - David led my officers on a high speed chase 91 miles south. 91 miles away from you because they believed you were in his car. He only stopped. He only stopped because he bled out. - So he was alone. - Do you have anything else you'd like to add? - I never even called him Dad. - Great job, Jim. Yeah, great job, 100% successful. - I don't believe so, sir. - I beg your pardon. - I executed the motel manager. He was trying to extort monies for information. Nevertheless he received no due process. - Forget about it, Jim, I'm not interested. This was a job well done so give yourself a pat on the back. - There was some collateral damage too. I myself sustained an injury here on my left shoulder. - Of course and I hope that's healing well. Look, you're a hero and I'm gonna make a recommendation for a Purple Heart for you, Jim. - I didn't take him in alive. - There was no need to, he was illegal. He had an arrest record the length of your arm for smuggling. Look, screw him. He was just in it for the money and we don't need his kind in this great country of ours. - It was for Violet. - What? - The girl, she was his daughter. So he was doing it because he was a father. - He was a coward. He was running away form the deportation protocols... - He died, sir. Sacrificed himself for what he believed in which was protecting his child. Whether you agree with it or not. He was a lot of things, he was no coward. - We're done here, case closed. - When Mexico sends its people they're not sending their best. They're not sending you, they're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists and some I assume are good people. They are all violent. We have these great communities and they were infiltrated... - The state held me and reeducated me with compliance training. - We are actually. We actually are. We are getting 'em out of this country by the thousands if you can believe it. I never saw my mother again. - We will begin moving them out, day one, as soon as I take office, day one. But we will take them to the country where they came from. - All you want is something to complain about. Well guess what, it's over. Trump is the President, he won! Trump won and America won! - Just remember I told you, it's an immigrant story, not an American one. - Domestic violence in Guatemala. - They were separated by ICE agents. The mother was put into a detention center. There was yet another reunion. They hadn't seen her father in 10 years.
