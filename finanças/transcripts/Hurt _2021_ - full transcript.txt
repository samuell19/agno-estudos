Oh, Lord, the God who avenges. Oh, God, who avenges shine forth. It's true. Rise up, oh, judge of the Earth, pay back to the proud what they deserve. God give me the strength to carry on. How long will the wicked, oh Lord, how long will the wicked be jubilant? They pour out arrogant words and the evildoers are full of boasting, They crush your people, oh Lord. They oppress your inheritance. Mom? Roxy? You guys there? Give it up! Y'all want me to kill her quick? And painless? No. No. No. No. Let me know when you're ready. You're home. I'm home. Trick or treat? You can take another one. If you dare. If you want more candy, my sister lives on the other side of the woods, but I wouldn't go there. She's a witch. - A real witch. - Bullshit. You shouldn't smoke. What's your name? Rose. Can I see underneath your mask, Rose? I think you're pretty. No, I'm not. Not anymore. How did it happen? I made my daddy mad, I always made him mad, I guess. This one time, he had a knife. He said he was sorry. He said it was just a reflex. Is he inside? He's gone. I made sure Daddy didn't have any more reflexes. Where was your mother? I don't want to talk about it. That's not a real scar. - What? - I... said your scar isn't real. Touch it. See for yourself. Go on. Aren't you cold? No. Here, take my jacket. No, it's fine, I like it cold. Okay. It's the killer's, anyway. How did it go? Scared the shit out of them. Yeah? 'Atta girl. There's a six pack right there. I know, I like sharing yours. It's nice, huh? It's quiet. Hmm-mmm. Trick or treat, motherfuckers. Trick. I got nothing. We haven't hung out like this since your wedding. Oh, we were so drunk that night, especially Mark. This house is our house. Good week? It's alright. Got to admit, though, it's more of a headache owning that fucking farm than just working on it. Yeah, I bet. You, uh, you done any hunting since you've been back? We should, uh, we should go out one time before the season ends. Sure. Stop being so fucking scary. They never make it to our house. Yeah, because you don't do anything except wear that stupid witch's hat. Can we put the place up for rent before next Halloween? You mean, to someone a little less scary? - Sure. - Don't make me use this. You did the scar bit? Yeah, you gotta commit to it. Mom would have been so proud. Yeah, Dad too. Wherever the fuck he is. So you guys going into town for Halloween? No, we don't do that anymore. We've matured. Yeah, right. Fuck you. Ow. Lily! You guys should go. You used to love that stuff. It's your tradition. Oh, god. I'm horribly disfigured. Fucking normal. Fuck. Tommy, you okay? Yeah. Um. I'll go. I will make dinner. Sounds good. Just be normal, just be fucking normal, Tommy. Fucking can't. Jesus. Tommy. You changed your shirt. I, uh, I know you miss my cooking. No one hits buttons on a microwave like my baby. God damn straight. Thought you said you quit. I know, I did, but the killer just can't beat it. Who was texting you? Um, Mark. He was just apologizing if he said anything stupid. You like having me around, right? Tommy. Of course. Don't ask me questions like that. You want to go? Where? Into town. - You sure? - Mm-Hmm. Yeah. Let's go. Let's go to town. Yeah, let's go down. - OK. - OK. Hmm. Go put your face on. Kiss me? Kiss me again. Everything OK? Right now? Yeah. Let's go to the hay ride. We don't have to go. Let's go. God, we're so old. You look like you needed that. Please! Ah! You want to go? What do you want to do then? Help! Somebody help! Help me! Somebody, please! Help me! This is new. Help me! Help! Help me! Help. I wouldn't do anything. Help me! Somebody help me! No, please!

Shut up, just shut up. Just shut up. Fuck off! Fuck, fuck, fuck. And here's the Love Shack, where all sweet lovers go or they die. You can push me all you want, but I'm not... I'm not gonna go anywhere. Ever. Tommy? Did you hear that? - Tommy. - Sh. Tommy, There's nobody here. Shut up, shut up, shut up. Look, look, look. Tommy. The fuck you following us? Tommy, there's nobody there. Look at me. Shut up. Tommy? It's just you and me, it's just you and me. Don't follow me.
