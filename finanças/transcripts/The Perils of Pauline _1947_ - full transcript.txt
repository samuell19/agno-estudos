Will Pauline escape a certain death again? Watch the next episode Friday at this cinema. Even though it happened 30 years ago, we guarantee that Pauline escaped. Week after week, our heroine played by Pearl White, faced death and thwarted the plans of the villains who always pursued her. He had to do this, or there would be no next episode. But let's start at the beginning ... Please, sir, play the music! I like a lot. METROPOLITAN &amp; CIA FEMALE CONFECÇÕES Thank you Miss. Pearl! Do you like music, huh? Why don't you work at a phonograph store? I could also move the workshop to a circus with clothes for you to do. -Who told you to listen to nonsense? -I'm going to finish, Mr. Gorch. Of course, even if you need to work all night. This goes for all of you! There is a lot of work pending. But how will they end, are they wasting time with nonsense? Someone whistles, or plays the flute, or goes to drink water ... What do you think this is? A ballroom? Let's touch the machine! Sim... What do you think this is? A ballroom? How are they going to get the job done if they waste time on nonsense? Someone whistles, or plays the flute, or goes to drink water ... Let's touch the machine! Damn! You don't think I see what you're doing, huh? For that reason alone I should dismiss all of you. And you may resign. Did you see alone? Listen, Mr. Gorch, don't take it out on the girls, it's all my fault. I'm sorry, I beg your pardon. Feels a lot? Speak like I'm a nightmare. Do you think it's funny? I just made a fool of myself, why, come on. Be a good person. Girls need work. You're not going to fire them, are you? Well... That depends. Depends on what? -That's kind to me. -I always am. -I'm called Joe. -Joe ... Take your hands off me or pull your teeth out! Very good blow, girl! Very good. Without a doubt, you know how to treat men, dear. A girl 's best friend is a good right hook. It was the strongest I've ever seen, girl. MS. Gibbs, I think I got a little dizzy. When I was young and a man attacked me, he used his left arm. Bring my dress, I'm in a hurry. MS. Gibbs, I saw her perform in "Storm Clouds", I saw it twice. In the scene where you drink the poison, you know how to die elegantly. Thank you, girl, this is very flattering. Not only do I like you, but I know the whole world of the show. I think they are the most wonderful people that can exist. Apparently, you like theater. If I like it? It is my big dream. If I had the opportunity to demonstrate ... Just thinking about it makes me sick to my stomach. Come on, girl ... Here it is. -98 dollars. -Very reasonable. My secretary will send the check. Here we only accept payment in cash. But my secret ... Call her to bring the money. Then, take the dress. Impossible, we debuted tonight. I have to take the train right now. Pearl, keep it in stock. -Oh, geez ... -Wait, let the girl go to the station with me. My secretary is there. She will give you the check, then. You have to pay in cash. You damn miser! Do you think I'm starving? I don't think anything, I just don't accept checks. Very well, I'll pay with the damn money. It is just a thick and rude man! Open the door for a lady! Wow, what a way out! Go with her! If she doesn't pay for the dress, it will come out of her own pocket. "The Farrington Company presents: Romeo and Juliet" Farrington, Farrington! We can't be too late, 5 minutes more and they will start to destroy the whole theater. Where is this actress? I don't know, but we'll open it anyway. -Open? -Let's go fast! Open ... Open with what? -Who will play Lady Capulet? -He. - Under protest! -Breathe! Farrington, are you crazy? -Go, don't disturb, please. -Farrington, this is an outrage. It's our only chance, quickly. It's too tight. I can not breath. Too tight! The mustache! -Oh, no, not my mustache. -Ah yes... No, no! Farrington, I quit. Greetings, Company colleagues. I should kick you! Can I know where I was? Next time you're late ... Shut up, you Irish clown! We have a problem. See how the audience is doing! Go change! I told you, we have a problem! Srta. White, o Sr. Farrington. -Hello. -Hello. Don't stay still. Go change! I promised a test for Miss. White. You what? She has a lot of talent, and so does my dress. Yes, it costs 98 dollars. - $ 98? -In cash. Well, if Miss. Gibbs promised him a test, this is the most appropriate time to do so. - Wow, Mr. Farrington ... - No words, none. Don't say anything, dear. Do not say anything. We will solve all problems. The Farrington Company always gives opportunities. Leave the dress with us. -And the 98 dollars? -You will take the test. Or public waiting. -They'll kill me. -Don't you want to be an actress? -But I never ... -You must face any audience. Hello guys! I'm not part of the show. I'll just do an extra number until the play starts. Out of there! One is gone! Sure! I want to see who dares! I have a good aim. C'mon C'mon! See, I just ask for a while, it 's important that I get it. I'm going to sing a very short song for you. I didn't pay to hear nonsense! Shut up! If I do well, give me a hand. If I do badly, they can break the seats and shoot me. Sure? -Hey, do you know "Rumble"? -Yes, No. 16, guys. - In what tone? -I do not know! Just don't play too loud. Hey, she's really good! Yes, ideal for opening a Shakespeare play. Enough! To your seats! Go up the curtains! Sr. Farrington? - Did I get the job? -Yea. -What about 98 dollars? -I'll discount your salary. Gosh, thanks. Very cool! I feel so happy! I would hate that it was a dream and had to wake up. Girl, never forget this moment of happiness. Not even when they break your heart and try to put the pieces together to move on. Traffic! Do not worry about me. I'll be fine. I learn according to the things that lie ahead. I do not know. She is a very strong girl, but she knows that brave hearts, sometimes they break very easily. MS. Gibbs, having her as a friend was the most wonderful thing -that happened to me. -Oh, my girl ... Congratulations, Miss. White. Mr. Farrington said he is going to work for the Company. Thank you, I got what I most wanted in life, Mr. Timmons. -That is good. -Do you think I'll do a good job? As I know how to sing, maybe that will help me a lot, don't you think? Well, not exactly, Miss. White. Not exactly. When you sing, you lose some control of your voice. Acting, the basic factor is total control of the voice. You must control it and not the other way around, Miss. You must control it completely. More questions? Yes, what do you mean by controlling it? Well, raise your voice until you get the right volume, find the proper tone and design it. Excuse me. Design it. Don't just let it out like we normally do. And how can you project your voice? With your lips? Do not. With the throat? Do not. With the lungs? Do not. With the diaphragm? Yes. The diaphragm projects the voice from here, vibrating, pushing, taking it to the lips. Round, like an orange. Always projecting to the back of the theater, and remember, round, like an orange. Not just the buds. Think of the whole orange, with the peel and everything. Never articulate it as if it were a lemon or a grape. Now, watch my lips carefully. Look at the movement I make. Did you notice the intonation? Never forget the projection. Never do "like this". Mr. Timmons was teaching how to project my voice. One day I will project Mr. Timons by the ears. Mr. Farrington, I was finished, I'm going. MS. White, I hope to make you an actress. -Oh! Mr. Farrington ... -Sit, please. An actress, even a mediocre actress , needs work. Hard work, day and night. Theater demands the best from you. I demand. You should not consider any work that big, nor any task too small. I'll do anything. Honestly, I will. That's the spirit. It will start with small repairs. This is unraveled somewhere. You'll find out. This is for tomorrow's matinee . It must be torn. See you in the morning. Cia Farrington presents: Lord Dunsmuir's Madness My Lord, or car is waiting. My Lord, your car is waiting. My Lord, your car is waiting. Mi Lor ... -My petticoats, please. -Of course, they're over there. -Are here. -Thanks. Where's my shirt? - It's not dry yet. -I'm going to make it wet. We lord ... Is my sweater ready? -I was unstitched, I already fixed it. -Thanks. We lord ... -What about my socks, Pearl? -There, extended. My Lord, your car is waiting. No, no, no. Speak correct. "My lord, the coach is waiting". My lord, your car ... My lord, My lord, now drugs! Pearl, you're already on the scene. I'm terrified. There is nothing to fear. You will be wonderful. Very smart, Mi lady. Her talent is only surpassed by her beauty. Between! My Lord, your car is waiting. -I did it right, didn't I? - It certainly did. Mr. Farrington. How did I do? You are dynamic, Miss. White. Positively explosive, his entry was like a 21-shot salute. My Lord, your car is waiting. For God's sake! Could you keep your hands still? The Farrington Company Presents "In the Hands of the Enemy" I hope that tonight I will be able to please you. It sure will, dear. But Lansforth, you cannot leave. So it just hurts me. I have to go, dear. It is an important message. Colonel, the Yankees are coming. You better go before they shoot him, those northern devils. -They are not kidding. -I'm going, Magnolia. -Mr. Farrington, was it better? -Much better. Oh! Thank you, Mr. Farrington. Can I untie my hands now? Cia. Farrington Presents "The Lost Lagoon" Listen, Miss. White, you are Miloa, a native princess, who fights against Typhoon to say he loves me, but acts as a popcorn seller. I am really sorry. Guys, silence! They're going to have a beer. I need a little quiet. We will rehearse from "You told me many times". You have often said that I am very beautiful. But your eyes cannot look into my heart. So, let your lips say what your eyes they cannot see. The kiss, now you must kiss me. Your speech, Miss. White. Can you say it, please? You know the text, don't you? Then say! I will not hire a point just for you. What animal bit her? Idiot! Can you tell me what's wrong with these women? It's spring, it doesn't affect us, but some people get more sensitive than others. Oh no! I am not interested in the emotional states of Miss. White. Should. It does a little bit of feeling. Focus on your boots and hold your imagination. MS. White, on stage! Let's be totally objective about this, Miss. White. Vai interpretar Miloa, and kiss me several times a week. And emotions have nothing to do with it. If you want to be an actress, you have to know that the man you're kissing, is nothing more than an element of the scenery, like that tree, the door or the wooden bench. Sim, Sr. Farrington. We go back to the last sentence. Let your lips say what your eyes cannot see. Now he knows more than if he had spoken with words. The next line is yours, Mr. Farington. What's up, Mike? Forgot the text? Well, we will continue the rehearsal later. -What you want? -I want to warn you that the decent people of this island, they will not tolerate your shameful behavior. Why don't you go about your business? Go around, Pearl. Can't I pretend I'm wet with less cold water? Realism, dear. Farrington is a fan of realism. I think that before the eruption I will already be burning with fever. You shameless drunk! I'm warning you, I 'm going to report it to the authorities. Go away, you old witch! Go away! Get out of here! Good luck. Haven't I told you to leave yet, you witch? Go away! Sou eu, Miloa. You? Why did you come to torture me with your charms? Why did you come here? Oh, Miloa. Well... Come on, say it! Don't spare me anything. You're not saying anything that I don't already know. Say! For the love of God, say it! -What's the matter with you? -I caught a cold. It is not because it came that things changed between us. Did you come to mock my despair? Why do not you answer? I see the answer in your eyes. Don't say a word! -Health! -Thanks. With luck, we won't be kicked out of town! Let it pass. Hey, you better cover the name on the chest. If there's a crowd waiting for us at the station, some may be able to escape unscathed. Mike, what is done is done, forget it. Forget? I can do it, but what about the city? When the name Farrington is mentioned, everyone will laugh. What is wrong with it? Everyone had a great time. Even the public. This is not a comedy company. -Health! - Shut up! What blame do I have if I catch a cold? I should have chosen a more opportune time. If I hadn't gotten wet, it wouldn't have happened. Wet or dry, she is a weak actress. Everyone notices that. You can't speak well. And when you speak, the voice comes out through your nose. - Shut up, you mediocre. -Mediocre? Yes, mediocre! If it were as good as you think, it would be on Broadway, and not from city to city, afraid of sheriffs. -Enough! -OK. Maybe she's a weak actress, but I tried, didn't I? I gave my all. And you treating me like I'm out of the gutter. And do you know why? I trusted you, I thought you were someone special. A real director, but he's just a tyrant. He is a cheap and intolerant director . -Where are you going, Pearl? -Back to the factory. As unbearable as it is, nothing compares the suffering of working with you. Weird... When Pearl said that, it seemed like she was speaking for me. I don't think I feel happier here, Mike. See, it 's a matter of loyalty. I'm too old to go back. Very well. I won't ask if you want to stay, Julia. I never ask for favors. I didn't learn to do that. You will learn, my friend. Learn to. But it will only come with time. W &amp; J.

You are the queen of adventures, the fearless fearless. -Why don't you do something? -I don't know anything about balloons. There must be a valve or something. -Maybe if I ... -Don't shake the basket. -What's the problem? -I'm not feeling good. Me either.

Thunder is the electrical discharge traveling through space. When you hear thunder, you're out of danger, don't be afraid. Continue... Keep talking, I like your voice vibrating under your shirt. It makes me feel better. Is my heart still there? Well, I thought it was in my boots. Mike, I'm not afraid anymore. That is good. I feel relaxed and sleepy. This is bad? Maybe it's the altitude. Mike, hold me tight. -Better? -Much better. This is ridiculous, if it were in a play, I would say magnificent phrases, now that I have so much to say, I can't find the words. Mike, words are not needed, even a few, they would be enough. Mike, would you say, "Pearl, I love you"? You don't know how many times I dreamed of it. Would you say, Mike? Really kidding? I love you, Pearl. - Did you just say it as a joke? -No. It's something I've been trying to say for a long time. Oh, Mike... We're definitely going up. They are human voices, we are coming down! We're coming down! Look, we're going down. We're going down. We're coming down! Isn't it wonderful, dear? Yes my dear. It is wonderful. Careful! Don't forget that you promised to marry me. -I will not forget. -Here, I'll give you a hand. Wait, there are no cameras here, I'm the one who lends a hand. Everything is fine. Dear friends, this wedding will be a great event. Remember that it will be in 2 weeks. You're all invited. The best reserved seats, courtesy of the studio. At the end of the banquet, you will hear the song "Oh, Promise Me", performed by an orchestra of 60 musicians. Quiet! And we’ll also have the honor of celebrating the the mayor's wedding. Not bad, huh? When you met your fiance, Miss. White? A long time ago, in Danbury, Connecticut. -He took $ 98 from her. -But he gave it back to me. Can we take a picture next to the flowers, please? -Where's Mike? -Mike? Farrington, Farrington. It's there. Okay, Farrington. We are waiting for you, cheer up. Stay with the flowers. No, the arm around her. Let's go. Smile a little. Show your overwhelming personality . Okay, guys. You can take the picture. Come to my office, let's plan the honeymoon. Come on, Mike. You will have plenty of time to be with him. -Where's the honeymoon? -It's not decided yet. The boys are suggesting getting married in a balloon. The same place he proposed to her. But we haven't decided yet. After all, marriage is not a show. Come on, come closer. Yea? Who? -Simonetti, from AP -Yes, it's me. Who can it be? - Come closer. -Silence, I can't hear. Okay, be quick. -Yea? Our! I'm already coming down. -What there was? The President convened a Special Session of the Congress for a declaration of war on Germany. Wait, you haven't heard the rest of the plans yet. There will be a reception ... What do you think about this? Everything happens to me! War! They could wait until after the wedding, but no. They have to make war and end everything. War, this is horrible! We have to rewrite the last 6 episodes. -Hey, where are the writers? -Mike ... It has to be something in war, battles, cannons, ships ... -Where are the boys? -I'll find them! Put them to work! Don't you know we 're at war? What's the matter, Mike? Nobody speaks here, You can't even think here. Come, ladies and gentlemen, come closer and we will think and we will speak for you all while you wait. Don't worry about deciding, we'll do everything for you. It costs nothing but your self-respect. Hey, it looks like you drank too much , Mike. Perhaps, just to maintain the illusion that I am still a man. Mike, no man has to do what he doesn't want to do. Mr. Timmons, you forgot something, you don't do what you don't want to do, but there is no place for the half man nor to the slave world. I don't understand, you love her, don't you? Sure, but it’s not enough. Things are better for you now, better than before. Will be? That's what I wonder. -So, what's the answer? - There is only one answer. Am I interrupting something? No, see you later. What's going on, Mike? Just the turn of a worm ... No, not even a worm I am, I lost my identity, I am nothing less than zero. Mike, he's still a great man to me. What's wrong with a woman helping the man she loves? Nothing, nothing at all. In this case, it's just business. I charge for each kiss, and double for overtime. Mike, you drank. Confidentially, this business would do well to anyone. -Mike, what are you talking about? -Look, I just got into this madness to help her, so I could interpret a scene with a certain dignity. But you dragged me into mediocrity. Did I drag you? Why, you unbearable snob! Did I drag you into mediocrity? I'll fix this. Mike, why are you doing this? There must be a reason. Are you trying to avoid marrying me? That's it? Answer me! That's it? I'm sorry, Pearl. You can't have stopped loving me like that, said he loved me and meant it. I know. It cannot have stopped as if pressing a button. Let's just say I'm a scam, describe me like this and let it go. Okay, Mike. If a man feels that way, it's silly for a girl to try to hold him. Maybe someday you’ll change your mind, but it may be too late. You better go, Mr. Farrington. This is not fun at all. -Pearl. -Go away!

You once said to me: "What a man takes in his hands, he cannot keep." "Only what he has in his heart can he keep." I had everything: Worldly goods and enough to keep friends and get rid of enemies. He had enough power to decide who would leave and who would remain. I took them down, one by one. Until there was no one else. I was alone. And I found that I had not knocked anyone down , only myself. No man is totally alone, unless he wants to. Wasn't it Chopin you liked so much, dear? Sit down and get comfortable for a while. For a long, long time. Farrington! Michael Farrington! Mikel Farrington e Irene Phillips in: "Kiss the Tears of My Eyes" Farrington stars in his own work. SERIES MOVIES ABOUT TO DISAPPEAR! So what if they're laughing at the shows? They'll have to buy all the tickets, won't they? -But Pearl White is finished. - Finished? Not as long as I can afford it, I will spend on advertising. The public no longer wants to see the series. They are maturing. Films must also mature. Mature? And I have not matured? I still have a boy's heart. Just like the public. You need to sell the product better. We will lose money. Excuse! Telegram for you, Mr. McGuire. I think it's important. How do you know we will lose? It only has seats and 4 walls. I was the one who had successes and everyone thinks they are geniuses! Jake! Going to Paris. Paris Casino Opening. I can still sing and dance. Thank you for everything, Pearl. Well, guys, maybe I was a little uncompromising. I know you have your problems. Who do not have? Old friends must remain together. I know what I'll do, I'll tell Pearl to take a vacation. I will cancel the series and so we can do westerns. Now you're being sensible. I take back everything I said about you. - You won't regret it, Mac. - Are you going to buy dinner? Yea? Who? Farrington? See you in a minute. Do the Westerns, but beware of the expenses. It will be a much better year, Mac. -We will make you a rich man. -And don't forget the contract. You already know me, my word is enough. Between. Hi, Mac. Now, now, the triumph of Broadway in the office of a poor devil. After so many years ... Why did you come? So that I can read your reviews? Where's Pearl? He wants to read her criticisms. I went to her hotel. She left. Where is she? -Have you not hurt her enough? -Yea. Then agree with me. Go ahead, I'm a busy man. Mac, if I don't tell you where she is, I'll have to do something that you won't like at all. -Like what? -Like a punch to your nose. Wait a minute. What is that? -Why do you want to know? -Because I love you. Well... here it is. Are you going to drop everything and run after her? I can not. Not until the end of the season. I never imagined that one day I, a film producer, would be grateful to a Broadway competitor. I hope the season lasts forever. Hit me in the nose, huh? CASINO DE PARIS PRESENTS: PEARL WHITE You haven't said anything for 30 seconds , What's going on, Julia? Just sitting here thinking about a beautiful and wonderful man. Now, Julia! I'm reading "Variety". And by chance there is an article that says: "Mike Farrington cancels a very successful season." I also happened to read this article and it doesn't interest me. Did you happen to know that a telegram arrived from his ship? Addressed to you. He says he will arrive tomorrow night. He wants to read you a little speech, that he's been rehearsing. what should I do now? Take a good tranquilizer? -MS. White, it's time. -All right. Why don't you stop playing with yourself? That's what I'm going to do. Does he think I'm a toy he can use whenever he wants? No, thank you. Never again. Do I answer that for him? In full, and don't try to omit a word. -Julia, did you send the telegram? -Not yet. Do not send. Send it like this: "I'll meet you at the station". It's a few words, I'll say more when I see it. Leave it to me. Oh, Julia. I am so happy! Your number is over, Miss. White? Can I do my scene? -The stage is yours, Mr. Timmons. -Thanks. Pearl. Queremos Pearl. Go at once! I'm going to give them a great night. I feel like I have wings. But Doctor, you took so many x-rays last night. You must know something. I need to know, now. I can take it. How serious is it? We agree that with surgery and then therapy, it is possible to walk again. It's possible? When? Injured nerves heal slowly. -When? -It can take 1 or 2 years. Still, there is no certainty. MS. White, don't be discouraged. We doctors always see the worst. We will know what to expect only after the operation. Thank you, I understand. I will make the necessary preparations for the operation. Wait a minute. I can't go now, not until the night. I have a date. MS. White, it must be done at once. Sorry, you'll have to wait. It is for a little while. I have to find someone. In that case, we will not be responsible, Miss. White. Julia, call the beauty salon, I want a hairstyle, makeup, -manicure ... -It's crazy, Pearl. Pearl, please, the doctors know what's best. Really, Timmy? I never went to college, but I bet they taught you that heart only serves to pump blood. Sure? MS. Gibbs, we ban. It will be a big risk. She has done this all her life. Nobody will be able to change it. You, being French, must understand. Please. Well, go to the hospital as soon as possible. Today, if you can. Thank you, doctor. I know what you intend to do. It is completely stupid. It won't make any difference to Mike. I don't intend to make any difference. Timmy, when it's time, can you carry me to the car? You carried me for years. It's the least I can do. Come on, Julia, start making me beautiful. I have a date with a man. -Pearl. -Hello, Mike. It's wonderful to see you again, Mike. I follow your career at "Variety". We all think you are wonderful. Pearl, a long time ago, Julia told me that one day I would learn to beg. That's why I came. Will you marry me? Back to America? Back to America? Mike, I couldn't. I belong to this place. It's my city. Whenever one of those Frenchmen yells "Bravo", I want to jump on him and kiss him. I love it! No, Mike, I couldn't go. You won't have to do that, I'll stay here. All I want is you. You know, Mike, I've been waiting for this day. The night you left me, I started to imagine things I would tell you if this moment ever came. Each day I thought new things. Some a little more violent. You don't know what it's like for a girl to be abandoned, Mike. And here we are. Nothing! I'm not angry. I don't feel anything, it just doesn't matter to me anymore. What you mean? I mean, Mike, that I don't love you anymore. But I know I owe you many things. She taught me how to be a perfectionist. Remember, Mike? Well, I'm afraid you're a complete perfectionist. Let's forget about everything now. It's in Paris. One of the most beautiful cities in the world. There is no reason why we should not spend wonderful days together. No thanks, I suddenly changed my mind. I just want to go home. Mind if I come down here? Pierre, stop when you can. No hard feelings, Mike? Of course not, you are a lovely person, although a little weird, Miss. White. Mike, quick. Between. Too bad I didn't see my performance, Timmy. This is the first time that I have performed well, and nobody around to see. I had the right shade. Pierre, stop the car. Stop here! PEARL WHITE IN: "PAULINE'S DANGERS" Timmy! Timmy, look! Gosh! Timmy, carry me! I wanna see. But Pearl, the doctors are waiting. Please, Timmy, a few minutes won't make a difference. Please. You were always a weak actress. And she remains a weak actress. His performance in the car was the worst of all. I always said: If you want to be convincing, don't move your hands so much. Oh, Mike... Just look at yourself. It hasn't improved at all. I don't think I 'll ever learn. Portuguese subtitles: Walter Santos
