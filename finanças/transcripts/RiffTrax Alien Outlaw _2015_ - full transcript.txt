Yes. In good hands I hope. So, in a week you will have fulfilled all of your prior commitments, Miss Jamison. [Bill] Prior commitments, AKA her gig shooting rats at the dump. Organizing your new show with us immediately. But I respect your obligation with other agents. And I am sure you will show the same courtesy to the Diamond Agency. [Mike] Otherwise we will turn up the typewriter sound effects even louder. In a week, we will be promoting you big. No more small town stuff. You'll have to stop giving those backwoods performances. [Kevin] The Diamond Booking Agency will not rest until all backwoods performances are wiped off the face of this earth. Understand? Yes. With the Diamond Booking Agency behind you, the scope of your little gun show, will be stretched beyond your imagination. [Bill] Like I could shoot at a watermelon? [Mike] Let's not go nuts. (horn honks) [Kevin] The Diamond booking agency. Enjoy our views of the good part of downtown. Okay Mrs. Diamond. After this week, no more backwoods performances. [Bill] Uh Jesse the thing where you leave a room, take a long walk, then continue a conversation. You're doing it again honey. Oh, Jesse. I was wondering when you were gonna come back. [Mike] Yeah you appear to be deep in contemplative thought. Two more days, Wes isn't here yet. Looks like we'll be going to Alex's place after all. [Kevin] Alex just felt a chill run down his spine. Maid came in and wanted to clean up. I told her not to bother. I needed to sleep. After, working like I did last night. [Bill] This is usually right behind Coffee is for Closers on those greatest film monologues lists. Looks like we're gonna be buying a new door Jesse. [Mike] Aw. Hate it when my back hair melds with my bed sores. Time and energy I spent last night, and that agent's secretary turns out to be a real loser. [Kevin] On an unrelated note, mind getting me some white castle to eat shirtless in bed? After you left. Said she couldn't talk her boss into booking us. Not even for one single show. God that burns me up. [Bill] Like the firey VD that's already burning my genitals. You know it's amazing how some people abuse their little bit of power. [Mike] Like how I pose as Hacksaw Jim Duggan to get free oil changes. Being abused by young girls. You know what I mean Jesse. Yes I do Frank. I know exactly what you mean. [Kevin] And I'm trying really hard not to picture it. Absolutely nothing booked after this week. And the reason for that is you have no discipline. The only time you ever manage to get anything booked at all is by pure luck. [Bill] Well don't forget his raw hear suit sensuality. Impress some gullible young girl and get her into bed with you. Well I'm tired of it. [Kevin] I feel queesier every time they say "young girl". Shocked and offended.

It's a motor ma'am. Do you know what's wrong with this? [Mike] (sniffs) Oh yeah. Your horse manure is running low. Yeah your battery will discharge unless you get another one. Do you have another one like it? [Kevin] A man, who himself, couldn't pass the touring test. Let me ask George. George! [Bill] I guess the dog's owner's perished in a firey map related car wreck.
