[music playing] [seagulls, splashing] [explosion] It's fine, Maw. Is not! There. Oh, darling, you are so beautiful. Oh, Maw. [GIGGLES] You can't believe how happy I am. MRS. APPLEWHITE: I know you are. No! You-- you can't see me yet! Sure, I can. Eyes that see into my soul. Lips that touch mine when I'm happy or sad. Hands like bridges that join us together. [KISS] [music playing] [cars] [shutter clicking] [music playing] [shutter click] [train roars] Hi. What's up? [dogs barking] VIDEOGRAPHER: Probablymore than your [inaudible].. GIRL IN VIDEO: I can't loveanybody more than my dogs. [dogs barking] [music playing] Hey. [SNORTS] I was just kidding. [splash] VIDEOGRAPHER: Come here. Come here! GIRL IN VIDEO: Turn it off! VIDEOGRAPHER: Get in my camera. I want to see you. Hey. You still watching those god damned things? GIRL IN VIDEO: My clothes, please. Don't start, OK? VIDEOGRAPHER: I'll gowherever the hell I want. Don't start! Max, do you realize how long it's been? [SIGHS] I don't know. About a year? Year and a half. Year and a half. Well, it takes time to make a case. Yes, it does. But on this particularcase, Max, it is now over. OK? He killed her. He killed her. I know it, you know it. Two months ago. Took that last night. He's out there walking around Scot free. So? So. So-- so what, we throw upour hands and just walk away? We throw up our hands and we walk away. That's right. We got a big fat file ofphotographs, that's great. But we got no big fat file of evidence. We need that. Max, we got a lot of clients here. This is not fair to them,and it's not fair to me. OK? OK. I'll think about it. OK. Can't ask for more than that. Why-- was she ever beautiful. Man. I keep thinking, like, whatif she wasn't so beautiful. What if she was like-- overweight or ugly. You're not just making a case here, my friend. You've fallen in love with her, haven't you? What are you talking about? You've fallen in love with her. What are you talking about. She's dead. She is dead. Well, what does that tell you? Doesn't strike you as a little nuts? Max? What? Look. We-- we've built this business together, and I don't want to seeit just like thrown away. I want my partner back! Want my friend back. [door closes] [music and woman laughing] I love you! [LAUGHING] Max. [music playing] DOUG: I know these mean a lot to you. I'm sure you want them back. We're sorry, Mrs. Applewhite. If I take these, it means I surrender. And I can't do that. But we can't prove anything. Your-- your daughter wasalone on that dock-- what? Because John Gilman planned it that way. We can't do anythingmore than what we've done. We've done everything. Even the insurance investigatorshave given up on this one, like a long time ago. So in less than two months,he gets two million dollars. What a wonderful reward, isn't it-- for killing my only child. Look, Mrs. Applewhite, unless Gilman comes walking in this office right now and confesses to plantingthat bomb on the yacht, this officially goes downas a propane leak that killed your daughter, Nancy. I'm sorry. [traffic] [knocking] [door opens] Hi. Hi. What's happening? Aw, nothing. I'm just watching the city. Oh. Why do we do what we do, huh? Money's good. Plus we're good at it. Come on. I'm going to buy you a drink. What do you say? Yeah. Sure. - Yeah? Yeah. [footsteps] Oh. Excuse me. Sorry. [music playing] [touch tones] [ringing] MRS. APPLEWHITE: Applewhite resistance. Hello. Hello? [click] [music playing] MAX: Hi, Doug. It's me. Look, I'm-- I'm on my way to South Africa. I know, uh-- I know. Look. When I get to Capetown, I'll fax you my number. OK? [beep] [music playing] [ringing] [beep] Yeah. Hello, Doug. Hey, Max! Wow, nice to hear your voice, buddy. Listen, I got your fax. I just have one quick question for you. Have you completely lost your mind? I'm following a lead, OK? [LAUGHING] A lead. I love this-- a lead. That's that girl in the poster, right? I think it's her! DOUG: There's five billionpeople in the world, Max, and there's no chance toyou that maybe two of them look the same? MAX: The body was never found, Doug. Never found. What body? The body blew up, Max. Right in the middle of the ocean. What body? Do you have any idea, sir,what this is costing us? Doug, if you're worried about the cost, consider this my vacation. I'm not worried about cost, Max. Jesus, Max, answer me. I know you're there. Hello! I'm going to tell yousomething right now, all right? You're not following a case. You're following an obsession. Uh-- excuse me. [girl giggles] Sorry. DOUG: Excuse what? Who are you talking to? Max? Max? MAX: I'm fine, OK? Don't worry. Don't worry. That's right. Yeah, that's the poster. Uh-huh. You didn't do it. [LAUGHS] No, no, it's fine. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks. [touch tones] Yeah, hi. I'd like to, uh, commissionsome travel posters. I'm looking for a specific photographer. Yeah! That's the one. That's the one. Where did you take this? Mama Africa. It's a local pub. Uh-huh. And, uh, do you see her there often? Well, from time to time. Yeah. I-- I would really like to use her. Did you-- did you get a release with an address, a number, something? You're kidding. You want the release. They want the money. Why don't you just tell methe number of travel posters you need? Ah, well, I'm just-- I'm just sort of interviewing right now. Listen. I've got this new [inaudible] system. Colors knock your eyes right out. Sure, but I-- really, I'm just looking. Listen, I-- I'll be in touch. Thank you for your time. You've been very helpful. [music playing] Excuse me. Do you have any, uh, [inaudible]- Sorry. Beer? The beer is fine. Fine. Thank you. BAR PATRON: Hey, everybody. Waitress? Waitress! Enjoy it. Thank you, thank you. [music, bar patrons] [music playing] [GROANS] [music playing] Mm! Nice to see you again. Hi. How you doing? Mm. All right. Enjoying yourself? Yeah, so far. So far. Everything the city has to offer. [LAUGHS] [music playing] Another beer? [music playing] [car door opens] [car door closes] [engine starts] [car door] [shutter clicking] [shutter clicking] [shutter clicking] [engine starts] [music playing] Warner? Yeah. Heh. Charlie Dawson. We spoke on the phone. How you doing? All right. Where did you say you're from again? Chicago. That's some accent you're sporting. Aw, yeah, yeah. I Get that a lot. I lived in Ireland for about 10 years. Ah. Whereabouts in the states are you from? - Montana. - Uh-huh. And how long you been here? 15 years. I was a vet up there, and, uh, lost my wife, and decided to check out some new horizons. Well, uh-- beautifulhorizons here, that's for sure. Good way of putting it. I like you already. [rhino honks] CHARLIE: Oh. Poachers shot his mother. We raise up orphans like that around here, and then we introduce them into [inaudible].. Oh. You're interested in taking a walking safari? Uh, yeah. Yeah. I think so. Well, we'll get into the laws. I've got some brochures for you. Do you lead the safaris? Once in a while. But my daughter, Nicky, handles that now, and she's damn good at it, too. You have a drink now and then?- Oh, yeah. Yes, sir. I'm liking you better by the minute. [birds chirping] [clink] To your happiness. I am happy. Yeah. Yeah, I can see that. Read up. Trips are four days, all walking. If you want to sign up, just phone. I got some bookkeeping to do, which is like putting socks on arooster, if you get my drift. [birds chirping] [dog barks] WOMAN: Pretty dog. [dog barking] Yeah, I know. [inaudible] [music playing] Bonnie, come. Hi. I'm Nicky Dawson. Uh-- Max. Max Warner. Nice to meet you, Max. [music playing] OK. Where do I sign? Well, that didn't take long. It must be those horizons. Well, as a matter of fact, Nicky's got a trio going out tomorrow morning. Trekkers are coming in this evening. I don't know. That's pretty fast, though. You know, most people take two, three weeks-- I'm ready to go now. Well, far be it for me to stand between a man and his adventure. Long as you've got a check and, uh-- Oh, I-- I just got to get backto Cape Town and get my stuff. Just fill this out, Mr. Warner. And we're mighty glad to have your company. Thanks. [footsteps] [LAUGHS] Your shirt's missing. [CLEARS THROAT] Uh, uh-- thank you. It's um, you know-- [inaudible] Yes sir. Never look him in the eye. You stare at a lion, and hethinks you're challenging him. Bad idea. Don't turn and run. You run, that lion goes, ah. Tourist. Lunch. There you are. I was wondering when you'd show. Come on, have a seat. Josephine! We need another plate in here. Guys, this is Max Warner--- Hi, Max - Your fellow trekker. - How you doing. Larry Spell. Reporter. Hiking with you. - Same here, Larry. Same here. So what do we do? If a lion charges. Well, if you can arrangeit, kiss yourself goodbye. [laughter] You see, the lion belongs there. We don't. So you just stick close to my daughter, Nicky, and she will steer you clear of trouble. You, uh, done some time inthe service there, Mr. Warner? Oh. Yeah. I got this when I was young and stupid. I did my time. Rangers. See any combat? Yeah. Yeah, Gulf War, Special Forces. So what do you do now? Sell life insurance. Oh. [COUGHING] Mr. Dawson? Have you ever been chargedby a leather throws? - Rhinoceros! - Ah. Well, now, a rhinoceros can barely see you. Got eyes like Magoo. But he can hear a berry dropfrom a tree a half mile away. So what you want to do,you want to be real quiet. Circle around downwind. You get the urge to approach? Don't. [music playing] [elephant squealing] [music playing] Hi. Hi. Hi. Nice out here, huh? Yeah. It sure is, it sure is. So you were in the Gulf War? Yeah. Did you ever kill anyone? [phone rings] God damn office! Can't leave me alone. Yeah? Uh-huh. Yeah. Don't you know? I told you [inaudible]-- I hope you didn't bring one of those things. Huh? Cell phone. Oh. No. No, I'm just here for primal adventure. People used to complain that they couldn't use their cell phones out here. So we put up a tower so they could talk anywhere on the trail. Then they complained that it ruined the view. So we had to plant trees to hide it. But they forget about theirphones after a couple of days. I didn't have time tofinish with the cheetahs. Don't you worry. I'll take care of everythingwhile you're gone. Well. [KISS] All right. OK. Let me just ask you this,does she dress the same? And that's what I don't understand. She-- she dresses like a tomboy. She's-- well, she's different. Is she a little different,or is she a lot different? No. A lot! I mean, a lot. - OK, then. It's obvious. Hm? - Aliens. - What? Oh, yes. It's aliens. Remember that movie, "Invasionof the Body Snatchers"? You got the pod people? That's her! - For chrissakes, Doug. Look. I'm telling you. I was two feet from her, you know? Anybody can put on jeans and change her hair. It's the same person. Well, you know, if it is Sandra-- just think about this for a minute. What is she doing hiding outin the middle of South Africa? I don't know! Jeez, I don't know. You don't know. Look, Max. This is not a joke. I need you here. - Look, buddy. I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm gonna fax you a picture of her. OK? You'll see it's the same person. DOUG: OK, OK, OK. I give up. All right? Look. This is what I'll do for you. I'll get somebody to check out Charles Dawson and his daughter Nicky there. When I prove to you it's not Sandra, I just want you to do one favor for me. Yeah? What's that? Come home! [SNIFFS] [beep] Yeah, yeah, yeah. [music playing] [click] [beep] [ringing] [fax beep] [music playing] [inaudible] mosthappy to be [inaudible].. [COUGHING] You OK, Larry? Hm? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm fine. Thanks. Oh, it's a beautiful day. How I'm looking forward to this. OK, listen up. Water bottles filled? Yep. It will take us about six hours to get up to Faraway Camp. So stay together, feelthe earth under your feet, and ask questions. That's what we're here for.- Right. - Great. - Let's go! - Wait, uh, wait! - Hm? One picture, please! [shutter click] Let's go. One picture's good enough.- OK. Enough for now. - One more. [shutter clicking] [elephant squeal] [music playing] [SHUTTER CLICKING, MUSIC, ANIMALS, SOFT TALKING] [music playing] [elephant squeal] Bob? Yeah? How long has she been doing this? Quite a while, actually. Her father's encouraging herto do what she loves best. You from Chicago? - Yeah. Yeah. You like the blues? Uh-- blues are sad, man. [LAUGHS] See, I have plan to go to New York. Be a singer. Aw, I've been there. Don't recommend it. Aw. [LAUGHS] Is it just Nicky andCharlie who do this trail? Well-- [roaring] [shutter click] What was that? Stay here. [gun cocking] [soft roar] [roaring] [WHISPERED] What are you doing? [roaring] Sorry. I overreacted. Army training. Didn't teach you to listen in the Army? On this trail, you listen to me! It's a beautiful country,but it can also kill you. And don't ever takeanything away from me again. Sorry. Is everything in order? Turned out to be a cheetah. They're pretty timid, actually. He's gone. Now, that's lucky. I thought I was going to have to use this! No guns on the reserve except the guides. You read the rules? You can read, can't you? Boy. You're pretty tough, huh? I suppose I am. [gun clicking] [music playing] All right! That's it, guys! Go through that gate on your right! [music playing] [non-english speech]! [non-english speech] NICKY: [non-english speech]? Ooh. Flew 15,000 miles, paid $4,000, for this? Ah. [GROANS] God, this place is hot! [insect buzzing] [splat] [males murmuring] Yeah. Been camping here a long time, huh? Yeah. Very long. Know this place like the back of my hand. [thud] Thanks. Harry, you look tired. Take the weight off your feet. Oh, well, uh-- yes. Thank you. Maybe I'd better. So what's for supper? LEONARD: Potjiekos. Ah, yeah? What's that? Afrikaner stew. Huh. Don't like Afrikaners. But I love their food. [laughter] [music playing] Takes your breath away, doesn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. For what? Blowing up at you this morning. No, I'm the one who should apologize. I treaded on your turf. Thanks for helping Larry. I worry about him. He doesn't look so well. He's dying. Lung cancer. He's got maybe a year. Cashed in his pension to do this trek. He told you this? The cancer part, I figured out. The rest, he told me on the trail. You must be a really good listener. No, he probably just needed to talk. Do you ever go back to the States? I did once. I studied Zoology at Berkeley. Took some time out, got married. Uh-huh. What happened? I discovered I prefer animals to men. [LAUGHS] [SIGHS] I didn't like the city life much, either. So I came back. This is where I belong. Yeah, I can see why. What about you? Anyone special waiting for you back home? No, no. Not anymore. I was married. After I got back from theGulf, I was kind of messed up. I think I was looking forsomething to hold onto. That's not a really good reasonto latch on to another person. I'm sorry. No. Long time ago. Time and chance. [music playing] Ever since you came here,you've been staring at me. Does it bother you? Why should it? [music playing] Enjoy the sunset. [clank] So Harry, what's the name ofthat snake we saw again today? We call it ebululu. E-bu lu lu. This stuff is great! Couldn't find better beef in Baltimore. It's not beef. No? Giraffe. Oh. I had to eat walrus once, uh, on a trip to the Canadian Arctic. In Hong Kong, snake blood. Very tasty. Snake blood? Whoa-whoa-whoa, hey, whoa! The animals you see all around you are confined to the reserves. They can wander scores of miles,but not the 100 that they need. We have to cull the herds in order to save the vegetation, andthe animals from starvation. Bon appetit, Hal. There you go. [laughter] You know, this is-- You're doing it again. What? - Staring. - Oh. Sorry. Sorry. All right. If I'm that fascinating, you can look. Nice of you. I can be nice from time to time. I knew that all along. Did you, now? Mm-hmm. What else did you know about me? Oh, you cook a mean giraffe stew. [LAUGHING] You're notvery good at this, are you? OK.But I'll bet you I can improve. Wanted to bet, you shouldhave stayed in Cape Town. No, no. It's not that kind of bet. I'm going to tell you all aboutyourself, and if I'm right, you have to spend the dayalone with me on the trail. And if you lose? Um-- the first lion that comes along, I lie down and sacrifice myself. Sounds fair. OK. I think you're allergic to chocolate. Makes you break out in hives. And you don't wear perfume up here. It attracts the bugs? And the male trekkers. But if you did, I guess you'd wear, uh-- Obsession. And gardenias are your favorite flowers. How'd I do? [music playing] It's late. Go to bed. Nicky? [music playing] How did you guys sleep? Well, thanks. [inaudible] The towel? Sorry, sorry. What? Oh! [LAUGHING] [music playing] [shutter click] This tree is a [inaudible] drought. [inaudible] [music playing] [clink] What's this? I lost our bet, didn't I? Ah-- what about the rest of the group? I mean, is this OK? I don't know. Never done anything like this before. It's all right. Harry and Robert are going totake them to their village. Of course, if you want to go with them-- Uh-- no. No. Not at all. Let me go along. Gentlemen, we're ready to go. What has he got that I don't? Abs for starters. [LAUGHS] Hey, watch it. [thud] [car doors] So tell me. What? How did you know that stuff about me? Uh-- no great mystery, really. But you spooked me. I want to know. Well, the other day, whenGeorge offered you chocolate, I noticed you passed. And uh, by accident Iwalked into your bathroom. - By accident? - Yeah. I'm sorry. Strange house, wrong turn. Ah. I, uh-- I noticed some anti-histaminesand your perfume on the counter. And I saw you planting gardenias in the lodge. Saw the way you handled them, really gently. And I thought you were a psychic. No. Just a humble insurance agent. You're not so humble. But at least you're honest. [engine cranks, roars] Uh-- you're in third. I know. [engine] [road noise] [water rushing] This is one of my favorite places. Uh-huh. It's odd. What? You choosing to be an insurance agent? Oh, well. It seemed like a good idea after the Gulf. I was wrong. How? Well, all day I listen topeople talking about deceit, death, other people's miseries. You know? I envy you. Me? Yeah. I mean, you love what you're doing. Gotta earn a living. Yeah, but nobody pays youto rescue animals, do they? No. [music playing] [water rushing] [music playing] [splashing] [LAUGHING] [music, splashing] [music playing] [laughing, splashing] Any wild animals nearby? Why? I feel kind of vulnerable. [laughs] You'd make a nice little snack! Hey, Sandra! What? Nothing. [drums and chanting] DOUG: Max, I've been calling,and I've been calling! Why don't you answer your phone, man? I've been busy. That's good. It's been very interesting here, too. I've managed to do all the work that you could have done from your comfy desk right back here in Chicago. And guess what? Nicky is not Sandra. Get it? She is Charles Dawson's daughter, and I have the birth certificate, I got the school report cards,I got vaccination stuff, I got everything, Max. Max! Yeah? Nicky was adopted. Adopted? Yeah. And here's the kicker. She had a sister. Nicky Dawson is Sandra Applewhite's identical twin sister. They were separated at birth. They were both adopted. Helen didn't even know. Max? Max? [drums and chanting] [music playing] You missed the fun. It's quiet here. I kind of like it. I'm like you. I like the night. We do that drum stuff for the trekkers. Helps them reconnect withtheir primitive male selves. [KISS] What's the matter? Nothing. I'm fine. But-- Nicky? That is your name, isn't it? Well, I used to go by Elvis. Yes. I'm Nicky. I'm glad. So glad. [music playing] [kissing] [music playing] [kissing] [music playing] Look. [EXHALES] Hm? Oh, my god. Where's your camera? On my cot. Why? I want to get a pictureof my mysterious insurance agent and the impalas. Hm. Be right back. Bye. [music playing] Hi. [splat] [non-english speech] Sort of like skinny bison. MAN AT TABLE: Yeah. They were something, huh? Mm. [music playing] [WHISPERING] I had a sister? [NORMAL VOICE] A real person, and you knew? Why didn't you just tell me that? I was waiting for the right time. Right time? It wasn't supposed to happen like this. At the waterfall, you didn't call me Nicky. You called me Sandra. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! You bastard. Why didn't you just tell me? - Nicky, please. - No. Will you just listen, please? Don't touch me. I trusted you. Nicky, please. You stay away from me. Nicky, please listen. Nicky? Nicky, please! [music playing] HARRY: Thanks for helping me. I've been getting some great shots. No, not at all. I enjoy it. I'm glad I came. You know, I've been thinking, I-- I'd like to be buried out here. Huh? Sounds good. Just, uh, wait til the trip's over, huh? [CHUCKLES] I'd like-- I'd like you to have them. What? My pictures. Oh, they're supposed to be meant for posterity, but I'm not going to have too much of that. I, uh, I don't have any family. I-- I'd like you to keep them. To remember this place. And me. I'd be honored. [music playing] Nicky? [non-english speech] Ah. [non-english speech]. [music playing] DOUG: Hey, Max. Long time, no see. You're crazy. I'm crazy? You started this. I just came here to end it. You really think you'regonna get Gilman this way, huh? Maybe. Isn't that what you always wanted? See-- nuts! That's right. You said it. You went to Helen behind my back. - Oh, did I? - Yeah. I thought we were supposed to be partners. Partners?Partners answer their phones. I phoned my partner. He doesn't turn his phone on. What am I supposed to do? I will not let you put Nicky in danger. I'm not planning on putting Nicky in danger. We have a client, you know.Helen. She's agreed. Of course, she's agreed.She wants Gilman! She wants what's right. I want what's right, but for you, buddy. For 18 months I've watched youeat your guts up about this. And for what? Now here's a chance to solve it. It's easy. [SNAPS] You know, you were born just minutes apart. Sandra was a sickly little thing. In hospital for weeks. Doctors didn't think she'd make it. They said I could only adopt you. Had no way of knowing that she did make it, and Helen adopted her, and-- and she grew up to be-- until this. A trekker from Chicago camethrough here a couple of years ago. And he had this newspaper. Pure fluke. You had this for two years,and you didn't tell me? Why? What would it prove? You had a good life here. I mean-- I saw nothing buthurt in it for you-- nothing but hurt. Why didn't you me make up my mind about this? Because I was afraid. Who knows what you're gonna find out there? You know you'll never lose me. No matter what happens, you'll always be my dad. Whatever I find, that won't change. [EXHALES] HELEN: After my husbanddied, Sandra was all I had. Perhaps I was over-protective. You must miss her very much. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Not a day passes that I don't think about her. So we're going to convinceGilman that Sandra's still alive, that she was rescued from certain death by-- who did you say? Frank Adair. Oh, yeah. A reclusive writer on some Aegean island, which you just happened tohave in your back pocket. Nuh-uh. Belongs to a client, who hada very wealthy husband, who was caught cheating, andnow she has a chance to show us her everlasting gratitude. Convenient business you guys run. Convenient. Oh, yeah. And Sandra has amnesia. She doesn't remember who she is. She's fallen in love with Adair. He was so jealous that he won't let her go. Mm-hmm. You forgot something. What's that? The pirates and the buried treasure! You expect Gilman to buy this kind of story? It doesn't matter what wetell him when he shows up. In two weeks, he's supposedto pick up $2 million, do you understand? He's going to be open to anything. And what am I supposed to do, sit and wait for him to kill me, too? You'll never be out of sight of an armed agent, I promise you that. That's reassuring. You can't make her do this. It's insane, and you know it! I really don't think that that's your decision to make, Max. Oh, really? Fine. Fine. What makes you so sure thathe's even going to show up? $2 million. And when he shows up, we're there. We're waiting. We record everything hesays, everything he does. But this is the last chance, the last shot. [music playing] Quite a collection you've got there. Yeah. What makes Sandra so fascinating? [EXHALES] I'm not sure. It's easy to get confused about people. I-- I created this image of her in my mind. Maybe I was just lookingfor something to hold on to. This plan was not my idea. You could get hurt. I'm already hurt. [EXHALES] You don't know Gilman. He's dangerous. He killed Sandra because she was worth killing. He'd do the same to you if he had to. GILMAN: This is such a miracle! I can hardly believe it! No, of course I'll go. I can't wait to see Sandra. I understand. I'll be there as soon as possible. Listen. Please tell Helen how happy I am. And thank you for calling. Goodbye. [click] [crash] My lawyers have called Gilman. He'll be there in a couple of days. This is foolish. I don't want you to go. It's something I have to do. Well, no point in arguing. I'm not going to try and tell you what to do. But you be damned careful doing it. I love you, Dad. Love you too, love you too. [music playing] [inaudible] See OK? [music playing] MALE VOICES: Run that line there. [inaudible] wrong? This is not going to work. You know, I told you already, if you can't get any kind of positional-- [technicians murmuring] HELEN: Oh, god. You are so beautiful. [GASPS] No! You can't see me yet. Sure I can. Eyes that see into my soul. Lips that touch mine when I'm happy or sad. Hands like bridges that join us together. We adopted her in Chicago, andshe grew up on our horse farm in Kentucky. It was very secluded. She was shy and gentle. Uh, buh-- but she had a lot of your spirit. You're more like her than you know. Gilman's on his way. He'll be here in a few hours. Still time to back out if you want to. [video starts back up] GILMAN: Hey, Sandra. Do you love me? SANDRA: I love you [GIGGLES]. I love you. SANDRA: But I can't loveanybody more than my dogs. Love. Love you. [plane engine] [clink] GILMAN: No, no, no. I'm not skipping town. Don't worry about it. No. It's just a littleromantic business came up. Yeah. No, no, no. You'll get your money. 40 It's is. Which boat? That thing? That boat right here. This boat-- is it going to make it? Is it going to get me there? It will make it, yes. All right. He's on his way. [boat motor] MAN ON RADIO: It's showtime. Hello, Max. [boat motor] [music playing] John Gilman? That's right. Frank Adair. Sandra. It's John. You remember me, don't you? Maybe we should go up to the house now. He's got something in mind. Mama. [music playing] Be nice. Be nice. Hello, John. Helen. Long time. - Yes, it has been. I am-- I'm glad you could come. I can hardly believe this.It's such a miracle. Oh, she's not completely well yet. We must give her time. She'll be just fine, as soon as we got her home. John. Can I have a word? MAX: She must have been,uh, in the water for hours. When I found her, she was hanging on to a piece of wreckage, andshe was delusional-- very ill. Thank you. So I brought her back here. Why didn't you take her to a hospital? The nearest hospital's 200 miles away. And I was on a 20-foot sailboat. And if I had taken her there, she would have died on the bottom of the boat. I guess that has a certain logic. Thanks. When she recovered, she, uh-- oh, she couldn't rememberanything, not even her name. I tried to find out where she came from, but every time I suggestedleaving the island, she-- well, she panicked. So she's been here with you for all this time? Yeah. Bits of her memory are coming back. She led me to Helen. Helen called you. I mean, you and Helen needto know what happened. Obviously, I wanted you to see her. But there's-- there'ssomething you should realize. What's that? I think she's changed. She's still my wife. I'm just saying that if she doesn't want to leave the island, there's nothing I'll do to make her. It's not gonna work. This is not going to work.This is not working. This is stupid. It's unbelievable. It is not going to work. You see, I should have played Frank Adair, and you should have been inhere watching on the monitor. This was your idea, man.You know? This whole Sandra pantomime was your idea. It's not working! Stop your bitching. All right? We're here. This is happening. It is too late to turn back now. So let's just get the job done. I'm transcribing. Don't bother me. - We need to up the stakes.- Couldn't hear you. We need to up the stakes. Gilman thinks he's going to lose Sandra forever. He'll make a mistake. Good. [SNAPS] I know exactly how to get him. We need to discuss the future. Oh, that's easy. I'd like to take Sandra home. Well, that's what we need to talk about. She's happy here. We want to get married. She's already married. She wants a divorce. Is that what you want? Look. I'd like to talk to Sandra alone. I don't think that's a good idea. What do you mean? I'm still her husband. Well, I think-- Frank. It's all right. I want to talk to John. Maybe we can go for a walk onthe beach after we're finished. No, darling. No. Don't do that. It's-- it's late, and it's cold. It's all right, Mama. John will take care of me. [glass clinks] [LAUGHS] Look at his face! We spent our honeymoon in Majorca. I took you out on the launch every day. At night, we drank sangria, and I danced the flamenco on the bar. [LAUGHS] I made such a fool out of myself. But it was OK, because we were together. What was it like when we were married? You know the way the aircurrents carry a balloon? That was us. We went wherever the wind took us. Were we happy? Blissfully. [LAUGHS] I adored you. Adair will makes me laugh sometimes. Did you? Do you remember your dogs? You used to laugh so muchwhen we played with your dogs. What were they? Border collies. That's right. So you do remember. Helen told me. Hm. I'm starting to remembermy childhood in Kentucky-- Helen teaching me to ride. But the rest of it's like awall I can't break through. Well, you've had a bad time. You'll remember when you're ready. I still dream about it. The boat exploding. Wake up in the middle of the night screaming. It was an accident. You're safe now. I'm here. It's time we should be getting back. Listen. It's a bit late for me togo back to the mainland. Would you mind if I spent the night here? Not at all. You can use the guest room. Thanks. Sandra? [music playing] Would you show Mr. Gilmanto the guest room please? Good night. Good night. [music playing] This is not going towork if you keep showing up every time he gets close to me. [SIGHS] I'm supposed to be your lover. He expects me to just show up. He's not going to do anythingunless he can get near me! Is this about him or us? What's that supposed supposed to mean? Are you so angry you'dput your life at risk just to get back at me? [EXHALES] That's ridiculous. Oh, ridiculous, huh? I'm just saying, be careful. You know? Don't push it. Nothing is going to happen unless I push it! OK. OK. We're tired. You know? Let's talk about this tomorrow morning. You-- you have the bed, I'll take the sofa. No. I'll sleep on the sofa. Uh-oh! I know that look. Women problems, right? Oh, god. What the hell am I going to do? She won't listen to a damn thing. Not a damn thing. Know what you're going to try? What? Groveling. Always works. Women love it. [LAUGHS] That's not funny, man. It's very funny. Not funny at all. Very funny. Gilman's not in his room. Aw. You're joking. I'll go and check it out. I'll be on four, OK? Ernest, you'd better go check the perimeter. Yes, boss. All right. [music playing] Max. Gilman's back in his room. Come on home. [music playing] He was there. He saw the blankets on the sofa. Yeah? So? So he knows we're not sleeping together. Oh. Well, I think you're overreacting again. I mean, I think-- looks like there's an extra pile of blanketsmaybe there or something. No, he's not that stupid. I don't think he's that stupid. He'll know something's going on. [SIGHS] This is bad. Yeah. This is not good. [birds chirping] [music playing] Sometimes I feel so lost. Too many shadows. Too many things that I don't remember. The only thing you have to remember is that you have a husband who loves you. [EXHALES LOUDLY] I want to take you home. But I am home. What's going on? Where have you been? We've got a problem here!- What? What the hell is she doing?Why is she leading him on? Gilman's getting very restless. He wants to leave the island,take your girlfriend with him. Max. Max! You belong with me. I love you. But I love Adair. Screw Adair. Come with me. MAX: Sandra! Come back to the house. Look. I don't know who the hell you are, or how you brainwashedher, or what your game is, but you're not getting away with this. I'm taking her with me! She's not ready to leave the island. She's ready. You aren't! Sandra. What do you want? We were married. We had a life together. You know where you belong. MAX: Sandra. Sandra. [music playing] What? If he leaves now, we've had it. This isn't over. I'll be back! With psychiatrists, police, court orders, whatever the hell it takes. I am going to get her back. DOUG: Don't let him get on that boat. Do not let him get on the boat! [boat engine] Aw. Aw, great. I was so close. He was trusting me. It would have worked if you hadn't shown up! He was playing with you. It was getting dangerous. OK? I could have gone with him. And do you know where you'd be in 48 hours? With your sister. NICKY: I'm sorry. We messed it up. At least we tried. I'm glad it's over. I lost one child, and Icouldn't bear to lose you, too. [footsteps] [zipper noises] Helen? I'm sorry. So am I. Where is Nicky? I think she wanted to be alone for a while. [music playing] [seagull screeches] Nicky? Nicky! Who are you? Who the hell are you? [music playing] Who do you want me to be, John? I don't know. But I know one thing. You're not Sandra. How do you know that? You want me to tell you. Is that it? [LAUGHS] That is it. You guys went to all this trouble just to get me to admit I killed Sandra? Jesus! Helen must be desperate. You still haven't answered me. Who are you? Some actress Helen hired to play the part? I'm Sandra. [LAUGHS] Yeah, pull the other one! Although I wish Sandra was more like you. Then maybe I wouldn't havehad the heart to kill her. [GASPS] We can't have someonerunning around impersonating Sandra, can we? [grunting] [struggling] Oh! [music playing] NICKY: [GASPS] Ugh! [splat] [music playing] Ooh. Ah! [punch sound] Max! [GRUNT] Oh! [GRUNT] Ugh! [gun click] [gunshot] No! [SOBBING] [thud] [splat] [music playing] [seagull screech] There. [SOBS] It's going to be OK. [SOBBING] No. Nothing will ever be the same again. [SOBBING] Nicky? [music playing] - [inaudible] - Sorry. - You OK? - Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, just fine. You sure? MALE VOICE: Hey, boss. Stay out of it. Whoa. Whoa. Nicky. Are you all right? Come on. [music playing] [men murmuring] - Thanks. - Hi. You just jump and swallow. No. No way. [men murmuring] Thanks a lot, lad. Right. No problem. [elephant screech] Nicky? [non-english speech] Yes-a. [elephant screech] All right. [elephant screeches loudly] OK. Water bottles filled? Yeah. Feel the earth under your feet. Ask us questions, becausethat's what we're here for. All right. OK? Let's go. All right. Nicky? Nicky. What are you doing here? You didn't answer myletters, or return my calls. I figured the only way to see you was signing up for another safari. [EXHALES] Anyway, I got time. I sold my share of the company. I had to see you and tell you how I feel. Group's already leaving. Let me tell you about yourself. If I'm right, you spend theday on the trail with me. Max, I don't want to play games. You're allergic to chocolate. Gardenias are your favorite flowers. You love this land more than life itself. You're the most special,honest woman I've ever known. There's something about you--just one day on the trail. [music playing]
