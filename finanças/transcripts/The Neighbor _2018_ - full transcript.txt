Uh... tell him I need to put those ones out back, okay? Yeah, out the back, great. That one goes upstairs. - There she is. - Hey, babe. Hey! How's it going? Yeah. - Exhausted. - Yeah? Hey... I'm gonna go say hello to the neighbor real quick. Yeah. Hey! Scott Maravich. - Mike, Mike Prentiss, hi. - Hey. - You're leasing from the Brents? - We are, yeah. I tell you, it's hard to find a decent place... for a good price around here. The pool sealed the deal. Yeah, well, with this weather lately, it's a good thing. Hey! Jenna! Come over and meet Mike, our new neighbor. - Okay. - This is exciting. Welcome. Nice car you have. Oh, sure is. You know, I can get you in one of those babies... for under $800 a month. Oh, uh... you sell them? Stop by sometime, take one for a test drive. - No pressure. - Okay. - Hi, I'm Jenna. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. - Hi, Mike. We should have you over for a barbecue on Sunday... a little meet the neighbors. - Great. - Yeah, what time? Well, I'll have to check with the missus... but early afternoon will probably work out. That sounds great, I'll bring the beer. Just call me on that number when you get a time, it's my cell. - We should finish unloading. - Yeah. These guys charge by the hour. Nice meeting you. Nice to meet you. - Bye. - Bye. - Hi. - Hello. Mm... pasta. Frozen ravioli, but the tomatoes are fresh from the garden. How was your day? Aw, kids are still in summer vacation mode. I have to repeat everything three times... and even then, half of them are somewhere else. I saw a car in the driveway next door. Did the neighbors move in? Yeah, yeah, a young couple... I invited them over... for a meet the neighbors barbecue on Sunday. I figured we'd invite the Getners, and Brian and Marla. I wished you'd asked me first. I have essays I have to look at this weekend. It's just a barbecue. I'll handle everything. I don't see why we have to be the ones. I mean, if we're gonna have a cookout... I'd rather friends come over. The Getners bore me to tears. They invite us to everything, I can't exactly... So let them host it. I'm just trying to be neighborly... I'll call them and tell them it's off. No, no, no, no, it's fine, I'm sorry. Never mind. I'll go take a shower before dinner. No mayonnaise? One test drive... All right, you're at an amusement park... and you're on that roller coaster, and just about to go... into descent, you know, and it's a jolt of speed... that adrenaline, that's a freakin' Corvette, Brian. - You say about 190 miles an hour? - Maybe. You know, where am I gonna drive a car 190 miles an hour? Anywhere you want, Brian. That... that fucking cockpit is built for like a chimpanzee... or something like that. A guy like my size, I don't fit in that fucker. You'd be surprised. Like, don't tell me you never wanted a Corvette? - Ah... - Take a test drive, then tell me. You know, Corvettes are kind of for guys with small dicks. - You know? No offense. - Oh, yeah? What did Paxton say? "If you're in a 'Vette, girls are wet." Who the fuck is Paxton? True Lies, man. Tom Arnold, Schwarz... - Hey, babe! - Yeah. Can you see if our burgers are ready? Yeah, sure. I love you. She's so sweet. I love wives. - Hi. - Hi. How's it going? Oh, good, what can I get for you? Ah, Scott likes his rare. Um, rare coming up. - This one right... right there. - Great. Thank you. How long have you been married? Oh, just four months, actually. But we were together a long time before that. Hey, I actually noticed that you're really into gardening. Yeah, it's sort of a hobby, it gets me out of the house. Right. - Do you garden? - No, no. You know, I'd like to, but I've never really been... in one place long enough to pick it up. Hey, what do you do, Mike? I'm a technical writer. Don't ask, it's as boring as it sounds. But I get to work from home and set my own hours. - Oh, that's great. - Yeah. Hey, would it be weird if I asked you to come over... and take a look at my back yard? It's a mess, and I don't know what to pull out... or what to plant, and... I'd appreciate it. - Anytime. - Yeah? That'd be great. - Hey, Jenna! - Yeah? Don't let those burgers get cold and don't forget the mustard. - Just wait a second. - Yellow. Thanks, Mike. Well, they seemed nice enough. Hopefully we didn't bore them to death. Good looking couple, too. They're just young. Probably rather be hanging out with people... their own age, you know. She seemed a little quiet, bland even. That Scott has enough personality for the two of them. Didn't you think he was a bit of a jerk? Not really, a little forward maybe... but I actually thought he was kind of funny. Just because you laugh, it doesn't make you funny. Sweetie, I have to get up at 6:00. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Oh, boy. Hey, neighbor! Hey! I don't think anyone's done anything... with that garden in, oh, ten years. It looks it, right? Oh, I don't know if I'm ready for a project this big. You'd be amazed at how quickly you can get that into shape. Want to come over here and give me some pointers? Once you pull out all the weeds and the grasses... and then you'll be able to see exactly what you have. Uh-huh. I mean like these lilacs here... they're beautiful, but it's completely overgrown. Yeah, it looks it, right? You know, you could divide them up and replant them... in different places in the yard, spread them out a little bit. But I was actually thinking about an herb garden... maybe. Sure, sure, you could mix them in with some draught-tolerant... natives, and that way you won't have to water them that much. - Really? - Yeah. Huh. Hey, well do you think maybe you could help me pick out a couple? No, I'm a busy guy, I'm sorry. Yes, of course, I can. Thank you. I appreciate it. So do you have any kids? I only ask, because I saw some photos in your house, and... Yes, I have a son, his name is Alex. - Alex. - Alex. He's probably about your age. That's beautiful, that's beautiful. That's a nice plumbago. Scott wants kids... but I, uh, I think I'd like to work a little first, you know. He says, "What's the point in having a career... "if you just have to quit to raise the children?" So... You could do both. Yeah. You could figure out something to do from home. I mean, if that's what you wanted. Yeah, I don't know. I was studying dance when I first met Scott... but you know, it's not like you can really make a career... out of that, so... Well, I can tell you from experience... that even if you think you know what you want... it's often times not what you really want. And usually, we end up settling for less. All right, now you're gonna depress me. I know, it's depressing, isn't it? - Yes, it is. - I'm sorry. I'm a realist. It's a fatal flaw, don't listen to me. I won't. I'll limit myself to keeping up that facade of blissful... contentedness, and just dole out sage gardening tips. - Does that work? - Yeah, that sounds a lot better. Okay. I should probably get back to work. - Right. - Yeah. That's the one problem with making your own hours... it's so easy to start the day... tomorrow. - Thanks for your help today. - You're welcome. - Hey, Mike! - Yeah? You are going to come to the nursery with me... when it's time to plant, right? Whenever you're ready. Alex is coming home this weekend. Here comes the laundry. - It'd be nice to have him around. - Mm. Have you spoken to him lately? A couple of weeks ago. I don't know about this new principal. She's pushing these review guidelines with no input... and there are teachers who have been there for 20 years... and they know what does and doesn't work. It's not like we have that much flexibility anyway. You know, I've seen it before, they come in... and it's all about making themselves look good. What's good for the school and the students is secondary. You teach to the test, the test scores go up, it's no mystery. Yep. You're not listening to me. Sure, I am, yeah. No, you're not. What did I just say? You mentioned, uh, the testing, and, um... Sorry, this is so boring, it's just my career. I'm sorry, you're right. My mind is not... it's not here. I'm thinking about this maintenance manual... that I have to finish by tomorrow. I'm sorry, I do care. Speaking of maintenance, you promised me... that you were going to fix the porch light a month ago. - Porch light. - Mm. I'm gonna go fix it right now. I'm going right now. - Well, just... - No, I'm gonna go get wine. I'm sorry. Are you kidding right now? What did I say, what did I do? Am I yelling right now? Am I yelling right now! You're yelling right now! This is so unnecessary. What did I say? I said one thing and you storm out. - You raised your voice. - I did not raise my voice! That's how I talk. Are you kidding me? Jenna! From the Patriots, Bill O'Brien? The... I remember, but I don't... Mike Vrabel is one of the linebacking coaches. - Want another one? - Yeah. No, no, I'll go get it. Nine minutes to go in this quarter... Second down, nine... blitz that he knows is coming. Hey, what are you doing? - You see this shit? - What? Look, she's in the garden, she's pulling weeds, dude... that's everything for you. - Jesus! - That's the real deal, my friend. Okay, I guess. C'mon, tell me you wouldn't nail that shit... if you had half a chance, I guess, gimme a fucking... If I was ten years younger... that girl wouldn't be walking straight. Assuming if you were ten years younger... that she would be interested in you. Hey, you never know who's interested until you try, right? Mikey... c'mon, you never had a piece of strange... since you've been married to Lisa? Shut up. No. No, Brian. "No, Brian"? Come on, man, only vultures mate for life. Oh, nice, I'll share that with Lisa. Look, look, if I hadn't gone out on Marla once, maybe twice. If I hadn't done that, I would have strangled her. I would have drowned myself by now. You better hit that shit quick, though, I'll tell you. Before you get old and fat like me... and chicks don't look at you anymore. She doesn't look at me now. - Not with that attitude. - What are you, like 14? I fixed the light. Thank you. Do you remember Santa Barbara? No. But I remember what we did in Santa Barbara. Get the fuck over here, I'm talking to you! Stop raising your voice to me! I am relaxed! Fucking come over and talk about this like an adult! Fucking wall! Don't walk away from me. - Hello! Oh... - Hi. - Oh, it's so good to see you! - Good to see you. - We missed you. - How you been? Give me this. How was the drive? Fine, I'm fucking starving, though. - Hey, hey, hey, hey! - What? - I made chicken tacos. - Oh yeah? Let me get you a beer? No, I'll just have one with dinner, thanks. Somebody needs a haircut. So, Andrea couldn't come down with you? - Audria. - Audria. No, no, no, I'm a... I'm a single man now. - What? - Mm-hm. I'm sorry, I thought she was sweet. You guys met her once. I know, but I liked her. Okay, well, get ready to meet someone else... because she's on to the next one. - Oh. - Yeah. Well, I hope that you're hungry. Dinner is ready in ten. Glad you could make it down. Thanks, Dad. Come on... yeah. You sure you don't want help or anything? - No. - Okay. I love you. Another one? Uh... no, I'm okay... I'm going out with Christian and Dave tonight, so... I was thinking that maybe tomorrow, the three of us... could do something together. Yeah? That'd be nice. Yeah, that sounds awesome. Let's do it. Gonna be a late night? Oh, God, no, not too late, I'm too old to stay up all night. Don't wait up for me, all right, I got my own keys still. Okay. By the way, meaning to ask... Corvette outside, whose is that? New neighbor... he sells them. Cool. All right, well, see you guys later, yeah? - Love you, Mom. - Bye, baby. Mike, my man! How's your weekend so far? Fine. Good to hear. You, uh, taking the Toyota out for a spin? Going shopping. Shopping. You know, I bet if you had one of these... you wouldn't wait for errands to get behind the wheel. Probably not. Mike, you know I wasn't kidding... when I said I can get you in one. I... I don't... Hey, if a Corvette isn't what you're looking for... I could hook you up in a sweet Camaro. Now, don't tell me you wouldn't rather be driving... that than a Toyota. I'm not really looking for a car, Scott. Well, you know who to see when you are. Catch you later. Have fun, babe. - How's it going? - Hey. Fine. That's good. I'm... Sorry, Mike, I'm gonna be late for yoga. Oh, yeah, yeah. Brian. You think it would fucking kill them... to clean the bathroom in this place? Ssh... They should put a target and like a bull's-eye... in the general vicinity of the toilet, for Christ's sake. So let me tell you what... Oh, yeah, what's going on with the neighbor? I don't think she's in a very good situation. I know, those shorts she wears are criminal. - No, Brian, I'm serious. - Me, too. I'm in the back and I hear them start to argue. And then I hear this loud smack... and then it stops. Fuck that guy, that guy's a cocksucker. You know he tried to sell me a 'Vette. What a fuckin' asshole. Yeah, well... You know, he pulled that shit around me... I'd knock his teeth out. Well, I didn't see it, I just... I heard. Yeah, I get it. You don't want to get involved. No, I didn't say that. Marla, she says the other day, "Don't be so confrontational". No, but you're right, I probably should say something. No, fuck that. It's not your problem, it's their problem. You don't have to solve their problem. Just keep an eye on her. Not that you aren't already. I'm telling you, Mikey, I think you're doing it... I think you're taking a look at that shit. So anyway, Gary comes back late, totally forgetting... that he promised his wife to give the dog it's medicine. He walks in the kitchen, opens the fridge... sees he's out of beer, looks down and there's... Princess laying there with her head in the food bowl, dead. - What? - That's awful. Right? Now look, the dog was about 150 in dog years... so it could have happened anyway, but Gary panics. I mean, how does he explain this to his wife? More importantly, how does he explain it to his... mother-in-law. who has trusted him with her precious poodle. Gary is shitting himself... so he comes up with a bright idea... tell everyone the dog ran away... but he's got to get rid of it first. So what does he do? He decides to take it down to the vet, a couple blocks away... have the dog cremated. He stuffs the dog in a suitcase... and he wheels it down to the vet's office... Mike! How's it going? Good, don't let me interrupt. Hey, hon. Yeah, I was just telling your family this funny story. Where was I? Uh... Gary shitting himself. Gary shitting himself! So, he stops at a bar for a drink... he literally stops at a bar with a dead dog in a suitcase. And while he's at the bar, okay? He goes to take a piss, comes back, out of the john... suitcase is gone! No way. Someone stole the fucking dead dog! I mean, come on, right! He just... he just wheeled a suitcase with a dead dog... out of the fucking bar. So the guy was expecting a payday... and ends up with a dead dog in a suitcase. That's karma. Karma is a bitch. So, hey, what do you say you and the fam come over for a swim... maybe grill out a little bit? Oh, thank you, Scott... but I've got a lot of work to catch up on. Maybe another time. Definitely. All right, hey, Alex? Yeah, I'm down, a hundred percent, I'll go get changed. Young lady? I'd love to, but like my husband, I have some work to do. - Thank you for the offer. - Of course, of course... Hey, you guys are always welcome at Casa Maravich... any time you like. All right, I'm gonna go get some trunks on! Have fun! Seems like Alex is more interested in hanging out... with the neighbors, than with us. I'm sure he's just happy... to spend time with people his own age. He's not a good guy. Mike, he's a good kid. No, no, no, no, Scott, Scott. I... There's just something about that guy that I... I don't think he's that good for... for her, you know. She's... she's just so young and I don't know, I don't know... I don't know. I just want Alex to be careful around him, that's all. You should let Alex enjoy himself... and make up his own mind. Trust your son, he's a pretty good judge of character. Good morning. Let me give you a hand. Could you? Thank you. Listen, I, uh, I don't mean to pry. But I heard the fight that you and Scott had the other day. Oh, um... I'm... that's embarrassing. No, no, no, no, all couples fight. He's just, uh, really stressed right now... and it was a dumb argument. Seriously, it was about nothing. You don't have to explain. You know he has to uh, watch his temper when he's been drinking. Maybe he should stop drinking. Thank you for worrying about me, though... I mean it. He's a great guy most of the time. You must think I'm pathetic. No, I don't, I don't think you're pathetic. Scott's a lucky guy. Thank you. Hey! I saw you humping that junk, I thought you could use a hand. - Alex, we got it! - Thanks! Okay, that's cool. I better get back inside... and clean up the rest of this stuff. Thank you, Mike. Hello? Yeah, we could go now. No, really, there's like a pound of this stuff... in a grocery bag on the floor, right at my feet. And the cop is shining the flashlight... all over the inside of the car. And I'm pretty sure at this point... that Brian has peed himself, maybe twice. And, I'm so stoned that I... I'm positive that I can talk us out of the situation. So, wait, did you get busted or what? I'm getting there, don't rush me on this. - So, we would have, but, so... - Okay, okay. - Brian reaches for his wallet. - Uh-huh. He's trying to get his I.D., but he's so nervous... he drops the wallet on the floor. So, he bends over to pick up the wallet, and the cop freaks out. He starts screaming, "Just get your hands on the dashboard... "right now, you idiots!" I remember the "you idiots" part. You are idiots. Which nobody could disagree with at that point. "You idiots!" And then, no, and then, right then, right? - Right. - Wham! - A drunk, driving down the road... - No! Drives right into the back of the police car. - No! - No... Drives it, then he backs up, and he takes off down the highway. So the cop is standing there and he's shocked, he's stunned. - He's looking around, he's like... - I'm shocked. I know, so are we. We just heard a loud noise... and couldn't figure out what was going on. So the cop turns, he runs... and he just runs back to his car... he hops in his car and he takes off. And the two of us are sitting there, we stop for a second... and look at each other like... "Okay, what the fuck just happened?" And then we bust out laughing. - What? That is insane! - I know! That story is insane! And that is when I figured that it was safer to grow my own. Of course, I never pictured you as some like big, pot smoker. I think we were 19 at the time. I haven't had that stuff in a really... really, really long, long time. But that's what got me into gardening. Oh, I see. Uh, well, I have some, uh, weed back at home, medical... if you want to. Yeah? You all right? Jesus, I don't remember it being that strong. I might be done gardening for the day. I don't actually smoke a lot, but I get nervous without it. - Hope I don't make you nervous. - No... nope. No, you, um, make me calm. - Calm is good, calm is good. - Mm-hm. - Thirsty? - Yeah. I have some beers in the fridge. Seriously perfect. Hey, I wanted to thank you, for all your help... in the garden. Oh, it's my pleasure. Can I talk to you... honestly? Of course, you can. Ah, you don't have to worry about it, it's not your problem. I shouldn't drag you into it. No, no, no, no, it's... Jenna, it's fine. Well, the truth is, uh, he's always had a temper. I mean, he got a little crazy at first. When he got mad, it was still scary. But it didn't happen often, and I thought that once we got married... you know, he'd be happier. I mean, he's the one that wanted to get married. He's the one that wants to have kids. How about you? Sure... I want a kid, mm-hm, a couple kids would be nice. But I'm starting to wonder if, um... now is the right time with Scott. You mean, you're wondering whether... you want to have kids with... him? Guess so. Then you probably shouldn't. I don't think it would be a wise idea to have a child... with anyone, unless you're sure. I really shouldn't be giving you advice on this. No, no, you're right. I mean... I think this whole thing... marriage, Scott... ...was a mistake. Whatever you decide. If um... if you need any help with anything... anything. That's sweet... but, uh, I'll figure something out. I don't even know if leaving is the right thing, you know. It's confusing. I understand. But if you do, I mean it. You're a good man, Mike. I should probably... I should probably go. Mike. I'm thinking of starting yoga. Hm. Jenna said she'd take me to her class. Oh, when did you talk to her? The other day. Oh. Is it odd that I would talk to the neighbors? No! No, I just didn't know you were friendly, that's all. She's pretty, isn't she? She is pretty. And young. What are we talking about? I'm just noticing. Is that what this is about? A pretty young girl moves in next door... and you think I'm... what, checking her out? She's young enough to be our daughter. - Do you have a crush on her? - Jesus, no! Go, go, do yoga with Jenna, whatever. Don't... don't make this about me. Come on, guys! Come on, now! I see Alex isn't joining us tonight. He's out with Scott and Jenna, and some others. He doesn't have a... He's young, he can enjoy himself. I'd rather he didn't do it with Scott. Yes, you've made that clear. But I care about him. I'm not the one always letting him off the hook. Don't blame me, because you're upset with Alex. I'm not blaming anyone. Jesus, how did this become about me? You're making it about you. No fucking way, that's fucking bullshit! I thought that was my client! I hate... hey, he's crazy if he thinks I'm gonna let him... screw me out of that commission, fuck him! Hey, I'll call you later, okay. Mike, what are you... what are you doing in my house? I heard something break and then I heard a scream. Yeah. She tripped over a cord and broke a lamp. Is that a crime? I just wanted to be sure that everyone was all right. You all right, babe? Jenna, are you okay? Hey! She just said she was all right. Why is this any of your fucking business? Mike... you're out of bounds, man. Mike... everything's fine. I think you should just leave. What is this? What are you... You just come over to someone's house and you just... Why... why are you here? You want... you want to... you want to fuck her, don't you? I bet you sit up in that office and jerk off... every time she walks out in a bikini, don't you, old man? You're a real asshole. I'm not the one who showed up at someone's house uninvited, Mike! What's going on? I'll tell you inside. You okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. What? I heard this fighting and something breaking... so I went next door. And? And the sliding glass doors, they were open... so... You went inside? He hits her, Lisa. You've seen this? I don't have to see it, she as much as told me that... Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to freak you out. If you knew that he was violent... why didn't you call the police? I didn't have time to call the police, because I heard... something breaking and then there was this scream. Was she hurt? No, no, I don't... I don't think so. I don't think so. She's afraid of him, Lisa. Why is she telling you this? You know what he said? He said that a lamp broke. That she tripped over a lamp and that's what broke. I don't like this. Well, I don't like this, either. I don't like you getting involved. Promise me if something like this happens again... you'll call the police. Mike! Mike! You can't fix this. I'm not trying to fix anything. I was just trying to help someone. Hi. I don't know what's going on with you... but I need some time away. Away from what? From you. Why? Whatever it is that's happening with you... it doesn't belong in this house. Lisa, I-I think that... that if we... No... it's not we, it's you. I need you to leave. I want you to go. - Hey. - Hi. - You're all right, right? - Yeah, I'm fine. Okay. I think I'm gonna leave him. Oh. Yeah, uh, I have this ex-boyfriend from college... who said that I could stay at his place in San Diego. He travels, so he's never really there. I don't really have anywhere else to go, so... I'm... I'm moving out, too. - What? - Today. It's a trial separation. Wait, it has nothing to do with what happened... No, no, no, it's... No. I'm sorry, that's... Yeah, well. - Life. - Right. Listen, this is gonna sound really crazy... I'm gonna have to find a place... more than the hotel that I'm going to... and when I do, you are more than welcome to stay. If you wanted to, it'll be a two bedroom, of course. I don't know, Mike. I just don't know if it's a good idea. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - No, it's fine. Forget it, I shouldn't... I really appreciate everything that you've done for me. Thank you, Mike. Honestly. Hey, Dad. - Alex... hey. - Hello. Hey, well, I'm sure you've talked to your mother already... but I just wanted you to hear it from me, son... that, you know, that I've moved out and that we're separated. Okay, well, I mean she said you were... she kicked you out. Yeah. Well, I guess that we needed some breathing space... to re-evaluate, you know? I don't think either one of us were... well... as happy as that... as we could be. She, uh, said you're having a midlife crisis. Is that what she said? Well, aren't you? Yeah, well, spend time with her, you know? She's gonna need it, whether she admits it or not. Okay. Good. Can't you guys get counseling... or something? This just feels really weird. Yeah, well we just, uh, have to figure some things out. It'll take a little while. Just it'll take a little while. I love you, son. I love you, too, Dad. Look, I'm just gonna assume you're gonna get the irony... in all this, because it's coming from me... but all this work and watching TV, this is unhealthy. Where's your laptop? Let's get you on some dating web sites... get you out of this shit hole. I think I can work things out with Lisa. Just give her some time to think things over. Mikey, you have a free pass. We need to use your free pass. You get back with Lisa, that's it. You're stuck forever. I don't think that's how it works. Man, you got to live a little. It's too bad you didn't close the deal... with that neighbor of yours. That was never gonna happen. Come on, you were like half the way there, right? I'm a fucking idiot. I don't know what the hell I was thinking about. Mikey, you worry too much. Come on, I was let go of a job that I had for 22 years. You see me worrying? Got to move on. Fortune favors the bold, my friend. Well, it doesn't really matter anyway. She's gone now, you know, she moved... with an old friend down in San Diego. I don't think so. Yeah, yeah, she told me. No, I just saw her at a gas station... sitting in that 'Vette and that douschebag of hers... was filling up the tank. Alex! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hey, Mike. Hi! Hey, Alex, can you help me with something? - Yeah, yeah, sure, be right over. - See you, dude. How are you? I'm good, actually. - Good. - Yeah. Good, that's great, that's great. I thought you were leaving town? Oh, yeah. I thought maybe that wasn't such a good idea. Ex-boyfriends and all. I know. So... you moving back in? No, no, I just came to get a few things. Oh. I hope Alex isn't being too much of a nuisance. No, he's great. He's really sweet, a lot like you, actually. Garden looks good. Yeah. I'm pregnant. Scott's really happy and, um... things are getting better, actually. He's... well, we're seeing a counselor. - Wow, that's... that's great. - Yeah. Everything's gonna be okay. Yeah. Hey, Dad, you need my help or not? Good to see you, Mike. What are you doing here? I'm making you dinner. I was thinking afterwards... we could talk about things. We're separated, Mike. No time for mushroom risotto? I just came to freshen up... I've got the classroom open house tonight. I could wait until you get back. We can talk about things then. I don't think so, I'm gonna be tired... from answering parent's questions for a couple of hours. It's not a good time. Why are you here? I'm gonna be late, I have to go. Hey, Mike. Hey, Jenna. That's probably not very... Jenna! I'm out here. - Jenna! - I'm right here. Then fucking get inside. Everybody in the neighborhood can hear you, okay? Who? Who, him? Big deal. What are you doing? You fucking smoking? You fucking serious? - Come on, let's get inside. - I don't want to go inside. Just go inside, Jenna, come on, don't do this! Let's go inside! Don't be... Don't do that to her. What? - Don't... - What? Are you gonna come to her rescue now? - Scott, stop. - No, no, no... Having a little conversation with your boyfriend here. Isn't that right, Mike? Hey, let's just go inside, let's go inside, come on. Shut up... shut up for a second, all right? You two running around behind my back? Huh? That's funny? Now, let's get inside, come on. Don't touch her. - Let's get the fuck inside. - No! - Come on! - Stop. Are you out of your fucking mind? Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you all right? Come on, get the fuck inside! Get inside! Ow! Mind your own fucking business. Get the fuck inside! - Jenna, what the fuck are you... - Don't touch me! Leave her alone! Are you two kidding me? Get out! What are you doing? Get out of here now! You get out! You get the fuck out of my house! Scott! Come on! Come on, Mike, get the fuck out of here, Mike! This is all your fault! See what you did? You see what you did! All right, Mike, you learned your fuck... Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! What the fuck did you do? Jenna... Get the fuck out of my house. - I... I... - Get the fuck out of my house! Go! Now! I need an ambulance, my husband is hurt... he's not moving and there is blood all over. Meadowpark Drive. Yes, please hurry, please. Baby? Scott, wake up!
