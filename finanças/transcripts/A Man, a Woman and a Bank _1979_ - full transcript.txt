- Does work, doesn't it... - You're a genius. - Conceptually, a brilliant idea. - It's technically brilliant. It works, we can get out of that bank with 10 million dollars, it works. Norman, you are a genius. Well, I'm afraid in real life, if you get and you go to jail for 15 years... Aw, come on, what are you talking about? You got nothing to risk, what... - What have you got to lose? - I've got 15 years in jail - to risk. - You got 15 years with Doris upstairs, you got 15 years of poverty, 15 years in a job that doesn't recognize that you are the best computer brain in the world? This is a fantasy, this is a toy, this is an erector set. If you saw a little toy police and the toy jail... It's 15 years in jail. We built this to prove that nothing could go wrong. All right, let's... let"s assume that we get away with it, that you get the money, what do you do with the money? - It has serial numbers. - I've explained it to ya... - It has all kinds of... - A thousand times. For seven years, I know Victor shung, right? I don't like his name, I don't like the whole notion of Victor whatever and I don't like - macao and all that stuff is... - Norman, I thought of macao, I'd get the money to him somehow, he'll figure a way for me to get it through to him... - See, it's not real... - The money goes to him. - It's not real to me. - It is absolutely real, he will pay me 80 cents on the dollar. That money will be absolutely clean, it'll be in a bank in Switzerland. - You guarantee that? - Nine months from now, you will have three million dollars. - All right, you claim... - In Switzerland, guarantee... You guarantee fit, you guarantee this? - Yes, I guarantee it absolutely. - Okay. I'm crazy, but I'll do it. It's really dangerous. Will you answer me a question? Yeah. Out of all the things you could have picked, why did you make me a ballerina? Mr. halperin! - Deal. - Deal. Our address, Christ missionary fathers. Hmm. Okay, um, why don't you come in here, and look over his shoulder at the blueprints. Don't look so worried, you're not worried. You know what you're doing, right? Okay, now you point up, try pointing up here. Um, the other hand, so I can see... yeah. Okay, now point up strong, you know, this is up in the rafters, there's a problem... You, you keep your eye on the blueprint though, okay? Come on, men of action, you can do it, come on, really pretend you've got a job here. Look at the blueprints and imagine that you've really got a job that you're gonna take care of up there, okay? Okay, now we're cooking. Okay, great, rest for a second, you're doing great. - Gino, these guys... - Oh, what's wrong? Well, where'd you get them, in a wax museum? Oh, perfect, just what I needed, could you stand right there? Denise, get me a card, oh, beautiful. - What's going on? - Denise, throw some light up into those crazy eyes of his. What? - You always have a hard hat? - Come on, lady, - I don't want my picture taken. - Gino, fucking fabulous. - Sign right here. - Oh, this is great. Standard release in case we use your face. - Use my face for what? - Just sign it, please. Wonderful, oh wonderful, thank you. This is all you have to do, go for the real thing. Well, I don't know if I'll use those shots, but... Some of these portraits over here. Would you page Norman barrie for me, please? Sure... Norman barrie, on 106, Norman barrie, 106, please. No, leave the door open. They get paranoid around here if you close the doors. These are good, these are very, very... Good, because I got my picture taken coming out of the command trailer with those plans under my arms. She just took my photograph, calm down, - will yah, that's all. - Calm down, calm down. She took your photograph, why don't we just take a full-page ad in the newspapers? Reese halperin and Norman Barry wish to announce the robbery - of a new bank. - Norman, I will get the photograph back, you can count on it. The only thing I can count on is the fact that you're gonna screw up every step of the way. Hello? Hello? Hello? Stacey, you locked the door. Will you open the goddamn door? Peter, why did you break my door? - You locked it. - I did not lock it. - Promised you'd leave it open. - I did not lock it. I hate you, it is not funny. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Will you forgive me? I brought this as a token of my appreciation. - Whatever I say is like... - Oh. - Oh, my. - What's he up to. I think he's going to jump. - A metaphor for you. - Thank you. It plugs into itself. Look at him. Oh, he's getting his... oh. - Put that away. - Not until we make love. - We are not going to make love. - Oh, yes we are. With whipped cream all over you. Peter, stop it. Stop it, I'm not kidding, it's not funny. - Peter, I'm not kidding. - Eh-eh. I don't think it's funny, stop it. I swear to god, if you do it I'll... What, what? Peter. I want you while you're sweaty and angry. Strawberry sundae with a cherry. Banana split with pineapple and fudge. - I'm nuts. - No. I am not amused... - Peter, stop it. - Do you want to put some on me? - No, because I don't want to. - Why? You're not seeing anyone, are you? What has that got to do with it? Stace, it has everything to do with it. I am not kidding, Peter. I don't want to do this, is that clear? - No, it's not. - Oh, please, listen to me, you're hurting me! I don't want to do this! Don't you understand? I don't wanna do it. - No, I don't. - Please! - Who is it? - Uh, Stacey bishop. - Who's that? - Yes? Hi, I'm sorry to bother you, - I mean, I... - Oh no, we were just... I mean, I, uh, I, uh... You don't remember me, I'm from the construction site. You took my picture, yellow hard hat. - Oh yes, yes, of course. - Who is this? From the construction shoot. Well, I was wondering about the photographs, about what you plan to do with them, you know? Oh, well, maybe nothing, I don't really know. Could be for a commercial... - I'm leaving. - Peter. I've had enough of this commercial shit. No, really, I... - Uh, I can leave. - Never mind. Now, what about the photos? Well... I'm an earthquake inspector, and um, it sounds dumb, but my mother doesn't have any idea what I do and I just thought that... I thought maybe your pictures, you know, might put her in the picture, so to speak. Uh, well, thank you. No, thank you. The negatives are at MacDonald and ewer, - an ad agency. - Oh, they're not here? No, 21 battlemount. Uh-huh. Drop by and I'll give you what I got. That'd be nice... I mean the photos. Okay, thank you very much, - 21 battlemount. - Yeah. What is the first sign of the flu? I don't feel too good, and you're not helping. There he is. - Thank you. - Mhm. Okay, let's go. All right. That's over there, right. Front stairway. There. So I didn't get it there at her house, I'll get it at her office, it's easy. You screwed up here and you screwed up in macao. I did not screw up in macao. - Did you get a contract? - I did not get a contract. Well, how do you know you can trust him? Because he's old and he is still alive, in his business that means you can trust him. Wrong. Get off my back, will you? - This is perfect. - Told yah. Alarm sensors are there, there. And up there. Good enough? Good. I'm gonna carry that money all the way down through... - How much is that gonna weigh? - A million dollars, 50 pounds. - Five million dollars... - 250 pounds. It's not easy robbing a bank. Alarm conduits, cleaver bastards, right in the elevator shaft. Right here, they come out here. There's your computer room, this one goes into the bank control computer, comes back out here, then the four of them go over there to the alarm box. Okay, if we're gonna cut off these from the vault sensors, we're gonna have to get into the elevator shaft and make our dio connection there. You can tap into the computer... In there. Pound on that, will you? That's a Wheeler lock. We can pull a line of the computer right along the toilet pipe, put your terminal right in there, you can plug it in anytime you want to. Then it's all up to the computer, boy-o. That's all up to me. Yeah, well, I mean, it's all up to you... The computer's an idiot. Computer doesn't know a goddamn thing, thinks it's working for the bank but I have the distinct feeling that your friend, Mr. Norman barrie will convince the computer to work for us. We're gonna be famous. We're gonna be very, very famous. We're robbing a bank, Norman, we're not finding a cure for cancer. - I'm aware it means nothing! - Come on, do you really think - this is the best choice? - You're goddamn right! - In a bank? - Yes, yes! - Stacey bishop? - She's in a meeting - at the moment. - Well, I'm prepared to stand behind my decision and your taste is in your mouth. - Oh, come on, Stacey! - If the guy doesn't like him, tell them they can shoot their own guy now... Ms. bishop? - Ms. bishop? - Yes? Oh, you're the one I want, but the geniuses around here don't agree with me. - They say you're too jaunty. - Too jaunty for what? I want to use your picture for the billboard above the bank. Seriously? Could've been a sweet thousands dollars for you, but they're not buying it, sorry. Well, that's too bad. - Do you have my pictures? - Oh, yeah. Oh, they're terrific. My mother's gonna love these, you don't have any more do you? Oh, you really like them, uh, I'll get you the negatives, you can blow them up yourself. Here you go. Thanks a lot, can I treat you ladies to a cup of coffee, - or something? - Coffee? Um, we're gonna be shooting down in gastown, drop around later, I'll buy you a drink. Denise! Whoops, I'm out. Okay, relax for a second. Stacey, could we wear something kinky, just this once please? - Something raunchy. - Kinky is so tired, it will be nostalgia next week. Listen, this lust and lonely I think should have more muscle in it, you know? Something more flashy. Powerful. Oh, and I don't want you to be powerful... Hey, I need a pair a heavy boots, - maybe a pair of biker boots. - You like my massages? - What do you've got on? - Push your hair back a little, sharron. That's great, bored. Reese, you're in my shot. - Do you want your clothes back? - Eventually. Where'd you learn to speak French, Paris? Fort chimo, Quebec. - Is that where you're from? - No, I was with a NORAD insulation up there. - Pilot? - Nope, radar intelligence. - Huh? - Computers. You sure seem to love what you do. Mhm. Sometimes. I don't know what I love. Dr. pepper. No, some of the stuff we shot tonight, that's for my own book, I think it's gonna be good, I love that. Right now, I'm in to rain, this section's called wet dreams. Wet dreams? - Too cute, huh? - No, it's... Oh, see you are gonna catch a cold, come on back to my place. I'll fix you some soup, who am I kidding, - I'll give you some vitamin c. - I never catch colds. Don't worry, I'll keep my hands to myself. I never catch cold. All right, a wish bone, let's do it. Please, if we don't do it now, we won't do it. No, if you do it now it'll be bad luck. So how does somebody get in touch with you? I'll call yah. Hm, I don't give out my number either. I got your number, 438-2245. Got it off your camera case, never forget a number. Wish I could say the same. - See you later. - See yah. Brought you a couple of items designed to relieve and restore. Really gotta get you out of this pigsty. Come on, roll over. Come on, here you go, won't kill you. - Oh, what is it? - Boy, you really look bad. One more. I don't think there's room for both of us in here anyway. Doris thinks that we should be separated for a while. It's not funny. She wants to find her own space, “I'd like to find my own space, Norman." She kicked you out again, did she? Oh, what the hell. Get you into a nice motel. Magic fingers in the mattress, dirty movies, - all the comforts of home. - Me? You can't move me out of here, I'll die, I'll catch pneumonia. - I can't leave here. - Let's go, Reese, come on. I'll catch pneumonia if I go out of here. I'm gonna check into a motel, if you want to stay here, you can stay here. All right? You can't smoke in the room. Do me a favor, let's just move in first before we argue. - Conduits. - Why don't you take your scarf off, and take your shoes off, and take... take your jacket off, and sit like a normal human being, you're only gonna make the cold worse. I think I'm catching your cold. - Tape, the conduits are down - I don't feel good. [ I don't feel good, I feel... I feel a little... I think I'm catching... I feel nauseous. I got a pain in the ass. I really do, I'm not kidding. I feel like... 1 don't feel... I feel very... It's probably psychosomatic on my part. I'm probably afraid of the whole thing with the bank, I just don't feel good. I think I'm getting it... Chills or something, - I got a pain. - Norman, I'm not going in there alone, you got me out of the bed, you said it had to be done tonight, now come on. I'm really sorry, if you... I... 1 just got kind of... Oh, boy. - Hang on a sec. - I think I'm running a fever. Okay. All right. - You got it? - Okay, wait a second. You got the bag? Do you have it? Take it. - Hang on a sec. - I feel like shit. All right, help me. Pull me. All right. - All right, pull. - You're coming up the wrong way - you got your head stuck. - My head is... just pull. - Pull me. - Ah, god. Ugh, Christ. Pull me, pull me for Christ's sake. Put your feet against the wall, for god's sake. Here, reach over there. Jesus Christ, you're athletic, aren't yah? Okay, let me get by you. Hold on. You don't have any valium, do you? Okay. I get vertigo in places like this. In fact, I got vertigo right now. I'm gonna die. - Careful with the screws. - Oh, shit. That's a six dollar screwdriver. - Norman. - Let's hope this works. That, right there. Okay. - Wait for the boat. - Where we going? Uh, we'll go here. Yeah, yeah. Oh. Woo! I think we should get out of here. Ah, woo! What was that? Wish I had a smoke. Both the elevators are gone. Let's get out of here, come on. Jesus Christ. Sounds like they're on the tenth floor. - What if they got guns? - We got guns. Mine doesn't work, it's a dummy. They don't know that. - What about your gun? - Well, it's my own. 357 Magnum, most powerful handgun made. Blow a man's head clean off. - What was that? - What, what? I didn't hear anything. Hey, uh... - Let's split, come on. - Yeah. Come on. I really think we should call the police. - No, no, they'll laugh at us. - Better than getting killed. - You're part time, aren't you? - So what? - Do you smell anything? - No. - You will. - Why? I just shit my pants. Yes, father, can I help you? Yes, I want to send some boxes to macao. Sure thing, uh, what do you got to send? Clothing, used clothing for our mission in macao. Macao, okay. We got a ship going out of here on Friday, straight to the philippians, Manilla, and then on to honk Kong, transship to macao, that's the one. You have something to send today? Yes, it's outside. Okay, father, that's gonna cost you $181 for the four, that's if you ship on a regular basis, but remember, you gotta get this stuff here the day before. So that's every Friday before 10, okay? I could just see Doris. She's looking at me now, I'm behind bars - and she's laughing. - The odds of us going behind bars are so slim, no chance. Yeah, the odds. Oh, boy. The things you fantasize about what's gonna happen to us about this, truly, deeply depresses me. Thought you said this was going to be a victimless crime? It is going to be a victimless crime. - No, there's gonna be a victim. - How's gonna be the victim? I'm the victim. Hey, what did you do to my clothes? Where are my clothes? - Come on, you packed my... - Oh, sorry. Through the color. I'm afraid, I don't feel... I don't know, I feel weird. I'll be very honest with you, I would like to get out of the whole thing. - I'd like to not do it. - You wanna get out of it? I really... I'm really afraid. I've lead you up a whole routine and I apologize and I'm sorry about it, I just can't do it. - I cannot do it. - It is okay, it is all right. - Well, are you angry or... - No, you're off it. It's finished, you go back and help Doris find her space. You know the magic word, don't you. W... what? Ah! Oh, oh! Oh, there's Richard and Peter and gene. Oh, big Jackie. Oh, I think I'm gonna wet my pants. - Oh, Norman, thank you. - You want both of these? I want them all. Hi, how are you, uh, we'll take four. You know, you'd make a great gameshow host, you really would, you're so cute and cuddly. Have you thought about going on TV? - Uh, you want one too? - No, thanks. I want one. - No, I don't. - You want one, just tell me. Ah, oh, I can't believe it! Is she fantastic, huh? That's where you've been the last few days. Yeah, got the grip of a grizzly that doesn't wear any underwear. - Where'd you find her? - She cleans the pool at the motel, I think she's a gameshow groupie. Says I look like Peter Marshall. - Who's Peter marshal? - Hollywood squares, you know? I'm in love. Well, should last forever, I figure. I am doing things that Doris would be embarrassed to read about, in fact, she's promised me one thing that even I, personally, am a lit... You think I'm making a fool out of myself? You having a good time? Ah, this is the best time I've had in 11 years. Well, live it up 'cause you know where you could be spending the next 11. - Hi, boys. - Hello, how are you? - Stacey"s down there. - I'll go get her. - I'm hungry. - What would you like to eat? Everything. Well, let's get out of this joint. I think we should come back to this fair every year to commemorate the wonderful experiences we had. - Oh, my darling, Clementine. - Boop-oop-a-doop. Stace, stace, hold on I want to talk to you. - Oh no. - Come on. - Who is that guy? - Stacey's ex. - Who is that guy? - He's some kind of artist. What? I want to take you home. Peter, can you see that I'm with people? - You're screwing him. - Oh, Peter. Please don't make a scene now, okay? Does he touch you like I do? Peter, I'll talk to you but not now. I've got to go. Stacey, listen to me. Stay away, fella. - I'll be seeing more of you. - I'm sure you will. Go on, go away. - No, he is not neurotic. - Okay. He is unique, I like it that he throws himself at things with abandon, even if people think he's a fool. I don't think he's a fool for throwing himself at you with abandon. Thank you. I'm sorry. I just have feelings for him. Take one. Wait a second, wait a second till I close my eyes. - Okay. - Mhm. - Okay. - Ready. - What goes up the chimney? - Smoke? I don't remember the rest of it. What comes down. “What comes down? Santa clause. May your wish and my wish never be broke. Mm, I love it. So how come you're not a sailor? I don't have a boat. That's why I got this outlandish job so I could make enough to sail again. - Ah-oh. - Rum, ey? - Mm. - No. So tell me, sail where, sail what? Talk to me, what am I doing on a boat with an earthquake, whatever the hell you are. Inspector. I got my eye on a dream boat, 40 foot, cat catch palomino. Two unstayed mass, wishbone booms. Got an after cabin. It's in New Zealand, maybe I'll be picking it up pretty soon. - You are a sailor, hm. - Hm, better watch yourself with that, it'll creep up on you. Good, then maybe I'll creep up on you. All I need in is the air I breathe, a little breakfast in bed in the morning. Oh, the rites of spring turned to nights in jail so I cross my heart and I jump my bail, woo! - I'm drunk. - On a fifth of rum. - Am I obnoxious? - No. I know I'm crazy... And wild. I know we're different, you're so good. So kind and straight and sweet. I know I'm loud, I hate it, sometimes, mostly when I am. - I like you, but Reese? - Mhm? Even if we sleep together let's still be friends, you know? Mhm. What did your father say, beware, beware of what? Take warning, rest and have a care. - Are you leaving? - Mhm. Don't leave, Reese, please. Take warning to rest, and have a care. - Missed a great double film. - Oh, yeah? Jack Nicholson, god, Robert redford. You ever notice how they kiss? Huh? Completely different. Redford turns his face to the side like this, leads with this eye, his mouth just a little open. As he comes towards you, he puts one arm around you and the other behind your head. As he pulls away, his eyes are kind of low. Oh, and then you know you've been kissed. Now, Nicholson's completely different, he's got that smile and all those teeth, and his eyes are level, and he uses his tongue more. And when you think you can't breathe anymore, he kisses you. And the two delight me together. He pulls away slower than redford. Licks his lips, like he's tasting you for a second time. And when he does that, there isn't thing on god's... Well, not really anything, I mean, I wouldn't do anything real raunchy or anything like that but... Well, you're only young once. When the body goes it's kind of sad. Oh, I love you guys. I really don't want to argue. No. How are the children? It was not my idea, Doris. Come on, let's be fair. I'd like to see the children Sunday at 10 o'clock. I'd just would like to come at ten, and spend a couple of hours and see them. All right, goodbye. You got a cookie? Thank you. I think my marriage is finished. I wouldn't know what to do with the money when we get it anyway. Did you ever get a pain in your chest? - What kind of pain? - A very sharp pain, - near the shoulder. - No. Ugh, I'm beginning to fall apart. Why is he insisting you fly back there? - I don't know, why worry? - Reese, he's not asking for this meeting to do us any favors, he probably wants to screw us. Well, if we don't like his deal, we'll do our laundry somewhere else. I wish we didn't have to do this tonight, I'm exhausted. We have to rig the lights, take care of the dimmers. - Oh boy. - Gotta handle the gate. We've got to do it tonight, because I don't wanna miss any work... they're beginning to look at me at work - in a strange way, you know. - That's like the pain - in your chest. - I know, I understand, they know nothing, but I'm beginning to feel like everything I do, they're thinking, "he's a bank robber." Come on. I guess I'm getting intellectual. I'm just associating the robbing a bank with sex. Maybe I'm robbing a bank because my sex life is no good. I've never had anything in my life happen to me like with this girl. Really. I mean, I... I... 1 don't think you could say that I was afraid of women. I wasn't afraid of Doris, not when we met. But I was... You know this is my first affair in 11 years. - Really? - Really. - The first? - First time. It'll probably drop off. There she is. The most beautiful girl in the world. - Uh-huh. - This is good. I wanna be able to see the guard station. - Okay. - And the garage entrance at the same time. And we've got a pretty good line of sight on the vault. - Ah, huh? - That's about it, that's a good spot, huh? - We should be far forward. - Just a second. Now I suddenly am nervous. Yo, look, you see the garage? - See it. - And can you see the guard? - Look it, look. - See him. I think we're being followed. Hang on. - Who is that? - I think it's that guy Stacey knows from the fair. Hold tight. Slow down, Reese, come on, easy! Ohh. You've done it. Do you get pleasure out of that? I was positive that that cop was gonna say to us, "robbing a bank, are you?" Or something like that. Eh, could have got me for reckless driving, if I hadn't said I'd slipped. Do me a favor and pay the ticket first thing in the morning. Just go right down there and pay it, so there's no problem whatsoever. You want curry? No, I'll have scotch. I can't figure out what she ever saw in him. What the hell's the difference to you what she saw in him? - What do you care? - How many cigarettes is that today? - Seventeen. - Oh boy. Turn out the light and start packing. Why? Because the freak in the car is there. Man's a nut, he's a psychopath. - How long are you staying? - How much is gonna be a week? $140. “We'll take it. 205. Here, to help with that. Okay. Okay, thank you. You'll have to tell her tonight before that weirdo - shows up again. - I"m not going to lie to her. It's not a lie, just tell her you're going to Macau - for a couple of months. - That's a lie, I'm only going for three days. That's not a lie, it's an exaggeration. Stacey? Reese? Mm, smells good. Yeah? Double. - You're looking rather spiffy. - Well, it's the least I could do - so I did it. - But seriously, folks. - Champagne. - Ahh. Oh, a celebration? Of course, I have some news for you. My peregrinations lead me to that maelstrom of inscrutable fecundity. The orient. - How long? - Two months. - When? - Tomorrow. It means we're going to be apart for a while, but... Well, it's been grand. Screw you, Reese. - Doctor hale, 1969... - What do you mean you're going to the orient? Two months. “What the hell for? I'm not permitted to tell you. - Stuff it! - Come on, Stacey, - I'm not allowed to tell you. - Bullshit, and don't use - those $20 words on me! - Come on! Have I ever been anything but straight with you? I know, well I could tell you, I'm not allowed to reveal to you - the nature of my activities. - My imagination may be a little worn, but how exactly does an earthquake inspector make a fortune in the orient? - Selling short? - Okay, I am permitted to reveal to you the fact that I am not, in fact, an earthquake inspector. - Are you married? - No, I'm not married, - what do you mean, am I married? - Well, you lied to me. Well, what, Stacey, I wouldn't lie to you, I haven't lied to you since I've known you. Stacey, I'd do anything to prove that I wouldn't lie to you. Bad mistake. Think so? Shouldn't have happened. I don't think a rape charge will stick. No, it's my fault. Aw, don't take all the blame. What'd I say? Nothing was revealed. Well, not nothing. Yeah but, where does all this lead to? Oh, why don't we start with coffee and go from there? If you're going to Macau, better put your pants on. Right, Macau. I would rather pay for you to go see a psychologist, but... - Look, it will not... - Cure sexual obsession. Come on, it's not sexual, it's got something, I don't know what it is, but it will not endanger anything, she thinks I'm in the far east. The ticket will come from the far east, she'll just see me in the far east, it'll be isolated. If you could guarantee me that I would be on a desert island with all the money, and a few months, fine, but you will not be able to do that. I guarantee you, I promise you, have I ever... Come on, I promised you that absolutely there would be no problem, okay? Really? You'll be on a desert island. - Yes, I know where I'll be. - I can't guarantee - how much money there'll be. - I'll be at devil's island, - that's where [I'll be. - Oh boy. I've sent the telex, she'll think I came from China. The plane goes in an hour. Plane goes in an hour? - She gonna meet you there? - I don't know, I hope so, - I'll find out when I get there. - Mm, good. I saw Doris's lawyer today. - She got a lawyer? - Yeah, very nice chap. $250 a day. Doris wants a divorce. Wants the children, of course. - Oh boy. - Wants to give Norman Saturdays between 9 and 11. Visitation rights. Another piece of good news, Marie, you remember the beautiful Marie? Won a prize on a game show. Trip to the Panama canal on a boat, luxury cruiser. One ticket, so Norman doesn't go, he's too busy robbing a bank anyway, so he couldn't go. And Norman's best friend, Reese, take 9 months' work, and throws it down the drain. Ah, you really think it's a smart thing? It's the smartest thing I ever did in my life. Okay. Bring me back a nice camera, some duty free cigarettes, and some booze, good luck. - See ya. - Okay.

Oh, I have a little present for you. - What? - $1,000. Hm, what do you mean? The bank now thinks you're perfect for the promotion art. Your picture's gonna be on the billboard. - You're the billboard man. - No! No, you gave me the negatives. Just the dupes, exciting, huh? Oh. Ohh. That's to bring you back. You spent the whole thousand. Well, now that I'm a big-time model. October 12th, that's... Three weeks, can you make it? I'll be here. Hey, Mr. tsang, this is my friend Stacey bishop. - Nice to meet you here. - Nice to meet you. It's a pleasure. Who's he? Part of the conspiracy? He makes blue jeans. How did you learn to speak Chinese? With difficulty. No, I was here in '65, '66. - C.ila.? - No. You were part of the c.L.A. During Vietnam. Oh, everybody was part of the c.I.A. They just didn't know it at the time. - Drugs, you smuggle drugs. - No, absolutely not. Not drugs, not c..A., not white slavery, none of those. I don't even care, you know that? Doesn't matter, I trust you. - I trust you. - Ah, not enough to tell me. I trust you, I don't know why, but I do. I know why. I'm in love with you. Is that okay? Wonderful. Just wonderful.

All my equipment. - What do you think? - Close it up. - Yeah, terrific, excellent. - It'll work. How much you have to pay for it? I traded in your car. My car wouldn't cover this. Took a second mortgage on my house. That's not who I think it is, is it? Looks good, doesn't it? Yeah, it looks like 20 years to life to me. Nobody'll ever recognize me, I guarantee it. I'll recognize you. Till my dying day, I'll recognize you. Start doing it. What's going on? He's shaving I guess. Well, what's he shaving? Okay. How was that? He didn't recognize me. We got it. - Okay. - She confessed everything. The bank computer system, which united security bank is introducing, is the most sophisticated system in banking today. Now, this computer control is activated by my fingers passing across this surface. Registering my fingerprints. My associate, Eugene haliburton, and vice president, performs the same print read-out. And only our fingerprints will activate the code board. It's foolproof, I assure you. This is gonna be a nice operation. Listen, they're opening the bank. I don't think, I think it's better we don't. Give me the glasses. - Recognize me? - No, I don't. In the entire building, is this instrument here. Now, the code board opens at 9:15 am, five days a week. Our fingerprints are delivered to a master print-out computer in New York City. Now then, this master computer is programmed, upon receiving these prints, to send information back to our controller computer, and from there, - back to this bank... - You want some punch? - No, I'd rather not. - Including deposits, - withdrawals, checking... - Mm, we'll make a withdrawal. Biggest withdrawal they've ever seen in their lives. Information concerning... I think I'll throw myself at his mercy. "Help"? Why you put "help" in there, you think there's a little person in there gonna help you? Sometimes this idiot gives information, honest to god. "Invalid entry, please try again." Sounds like Doris. Except she wouldn't say, "please try again." Reese? Bingo. Bingo! Peter, what have you done? Wake up, talk to me. How many did you take? Wake up, Peter! - Wake up! - I wanna go to sleep. You can't die, I won't allow it. Please, Peter, why have you done this to yourself? - I just wanna go away. - No, no, you are not - going far away, no. - Far away. You are staying with me, talk to me. Tell me about what you've been doing. What about your mural? That was so great for under the bridge. Talk to me. Peter, I love you. I've always loved you. I will always love you, I'll always love you. Come on. I think I'd better get under the bed sheets. No, no, no, you can't go to sleep. Peter, Peter, you can't get into bed. Peter. Peter, you have so much to live for. What? Just wake up, come on. You're just saying you love me because I took the pills. No, no, that is not true. I mean it. - I love you. - Show me. - Come on, Peter. - Will you make love to me? Oh, Peter, don't be silly. Come on, Peter, please. Peter! I didn't take any pills. I wasn't sure how you felt. I'll kill you. I'll kill you, is that your idea of a joke? You think this is funny? You are very sick. You are a very sick human being. Get out of my bed, get out of my life! If you wanna kill yourself, don't do it in my house! Now get out! Out! You're dead! You are dead! I thought you were just good friends with this girl? You're not behaving like you're good friends. You're behaving a lot more like you did when you fell for that... Oh shit! Why does it always have to happen to me? I'm never gonna look at another woman as long as I live. Don't lose your sense of humor. Hello, operator, hi, yeah. Would you just give me 242-4268. Hi, Richie, how are you sweetheart? Daddy, yeah. No, I'm in a hotel with uncle Reese. She left you alone? How do you like that? She left the kids alone. Okay, Richie, don't be afraid, honey. I'm sure mommy will come back soon. No, I can't come home now. I'm sorry, I'll call you, I'll call you in a little while to make sure you're okay. All right, bye, goodbye, sweetheart. Well, what do you say we go Rob a bank? Come on, Reese, it hurts me too, forget it. Tomorrow at this time we'll be on a plane laughing about the whole thing. Or not. All right, Reese, come ahead. Come ahead. There's a chubby weirdness doing slight movements that I don't think we really quite need at this point. Come on, you fat wart. All right, you can come. Sorry, stay where you are. Close it up. Leave me about four inches, okay? What are you doing? Norman. Norman, the door of the vault is closed. Norman. Norman? Norman? Norman, answer me, please. Norman? Norman? Norman! Sorry, old buddy, we had some visitors from another planet dressed in blue. Just pack your suitcase, and pack it tight. This is going to take a minute. Okay. Please, drive very carefully, and don't get a ticket. Excuse me. Hey. Um. This is too much. Jesus Christ. We did it. It's just too goddamn much. What the... Christ! Jesus Christ! I can't believe it. This is $4 million. What if only Doris could... If she could see. Sure you don't want me to come with you? Wait at the airport. Bye, father. Bless you, my son. Straight to the airport. What can I do for you, officer? Your right taillights out, father. Can I see your license? Sure, I'll get that fixed right away. No, take it out, please. Well, Alaska, how long have you been down here? Oh, just a couple of weeks. Listen, if you're planning on staying down here, you've gotta get a local license, you know. - Yes, sir, I know. - What have you got in the back? Clothing, used clothing, I'm a missionary. I'm on my way to the docks for the shipment of clothes for our mission in Macau. Macau, where is that? Uh, it's on the coast of China. We do very good work there. Hm, I'll be right back, father.

Father, would you take your Van, and pull it into the parking lot right there? - What's the trouble, officer? - I"m gonna have to take you in. You've got an outstanding moving violation. That's impossible, that's impossible. I mean, I paid it, I paid it myself, I paid it, I paid it two or three months ago. - I paid it. - But you've only been here - two weeks. - But no, that's this time, I mean, I come and go, I come... Officer, I've got to get those clothes to the docks by 10 o'clock, otherwise - they'll miss the ship. - Father, take the Van, pull it in there, you can lock it in a couple of minutes. - Now. - I will miss the ship, officer, if I don't... Yeah, I know, a 48-hour taxi drive. After spending my time at the bus station - doesn't change it. - Oh, I don't know yet... That's ridiculous, I can give you a check, credit card. - Cash only, father. - That"s an awful mistake, my son, I've paid this ticket. I mean, we're on a computer here, father, it doesn't make mistakes. Only god doesn't make mistakes. Well, you better pray for us all then, father. Now, I need your belt. Look, I don't have time to talk, Doris, in detail, I want you to come with me, and I want you to bring the children, do you understand? You can! Sorry, sir, he's not answering the page what? What! Shut up, god damn it! - What? I can't hear you. - I'm sorry, sir, - he's not answering the... - He is there!

I thought we were leaving today. I'm in the Tyson street police station, I need to be bailed out of jail. Reese! Well, priest. - You taking a vow of silence? - Shut up. Father, my car is this way. I'm sorry I had to impose on you, I'll make sure you get your money back. I'm going that way, thank you very much for everything. It was real. What? Reese! Is this part of this whole priest routine, or are you really? You're not really a priest? Look, let's drop it, okay, the whole thing, it was my mistake, just take care of yourself. Good luck. Hey. What is your problem? You, and I'm getting rid of it right now. What is going on? - What is happening? - Taxi!

You ass, I am supposed to go with you! You shit! "I love you, Stacey." I love you, I will never leave you, we'll go away on a 40-foot sailboat, - and never let go before. - Unbelievable, unbelievable to think that I trusted you. Trust! I have given you no reason to distrust me. Trust, I have never asked you one goddamn question about your whole costume parade. - Will you shut up. - Now you are a priest I have to bail out of jail? That's right, you go to hell! Goddamn. What about Peter? What about "I love you, please don't ever leave me, please stay here tonight." How about that? Goddamn it, drive on, will you? What about that, huh? Just go. Headquarters at united security bank, and I'm gonna switch you now to Dave bannock, who's standing by. Thank you very much, Paul. We're in the new united security bank building on tender street at the scene of what appears to be the biggest bank heist in his... At $4 million. When bank officials opened the vault this morning, the vault was clean as mother Hubbard's proverbial... Anywhere on the bank premises, and no known eye-wit... Bank, which only opened a few days ago, was reported to have installed the most advanced failsafe electronic security system in the industry. Bank officials are stressing that no customer safety deposit boxes were touched, and any money taken would have been insured. I repeat, bank officials are stressing that the bank... Son of a bitch. - Jesus. - Father. Sister. You mother. - Ah, brother. - Means to an end. You're an idiot and a fool, and you don't deserve me. Me and Peter. If you ever doubt me again, I'll turn you in to the fuzz. I'm very happy to see you. Why did you come? I was taken by a photograph of you. Oh. Oh god.
