THE MASSAGE Oh, you're home! IM such a fool! Excuse me, I have you in front of me. - Hello Girl. - Hello, DeeDee. - How did it go? - Very well, as far as possible. And how is everything here? Did you call that...? What's the name of that strange bald lawyer? -No. "Did Douglas call confirming this afternoon's appointment?" No, he hasn't called anyone. If he calls again, you can tell him to call me on the car phone; ...but not the lawyer. He represents Murphy, the artist I'm exhibiting next month. Douglas already has my number. Which maybe means he's coming, because he hasn't called me. Good yes. - So what what? You were going to tell me how everything went around here. - The gardener came. - And how is Mr. Li? He is going to prune the bush that we asked him to do. - Good. - He also put fertilizer. I have taken care of all the bills. You just have to sign the checks. I bought fresh fish at the fishmonger and made curry sauce to go with it. Just put it in the oven and follow the instructions. And now, do you want to go home now? Go away! Oh! Mr. Li said that he would not be back for three weeks. -He has to go to Taiwan, for family reasons. -Clear. He wanted to know if his niece can come the next two weeks. I hope you said yes. You are a wonderful housewife, Dee Dee. Every woman should have one. - You want? - Hello! - Yeah? - I'm Fitch. Fitch! Fitch? He has a date with me. Where is Douglas? He hasn't called you? He said that he would. He told me he was going to phone him. - To tell me what? -He couldn't come. - Douglas? -That's what he told me. So where do we settle, Nina? Hey! Hey, wait a minute! We usually do it here, but... -...where has he gone? Does he know it? - Who? - Douglas. -He couldn't come. I don't understand. My assistant had confirmed the appointment. Listen! The problem is that... ...I'm used to working with him. - "THE SUN ALWAYS SHINES" -I like it. Well, the thing is, I'm very used to working with Douglas. And I like him a lot. I really like it and... ...it takes time, at least for a woman, it takes a while... ...feeling comfortable, really comfortable with a man who... - You know... - Doug has a magical touch. He hasn't even been able to phone... Douglas! When you have a relationship with someone, a business relationship, ...you must show on your part... ...some consideration. It seemed to me that he was in trouble. He is too young. -He's not that young. -Well, maybe he's not, but... ...he is younger than he thinks. In addition, we could not call anyone to replace him. He has much talent. He has it and besides, he is very attractive. Women love it. All of his clientele is female. Or at least most. Out here he would be fine. Especially when you are intimate and you are. Douglas does it out here. But, now, it's a little cool here. Well, where do you suggest? In a quiet and dark place. I had to hurry to get here. So I just took oils and a few things. Regarding towels and sheets, ...I'll need some. Alright. I have left some things in the car. Fitch? Fitch? Fitch? Fitch? These things fascinate me. I feel real fascination for this type of objects. - It's my bedroom! - I already thought it could be. My mother had a spectacular collection of jewelry, if I remember correctly. She wanted to clean me up a bit, when I got in here. Thank you. She just wanted to clean me up a bit. THERE IS ONLY ONE TEMPLE IN THE UNIVERSE AND IT IS THE HUMAN BODY. WHEN WE PLACE OUR HAND IN IT, WE TOUCH THE SKY. Thomas Carlyle 1840 The ultimate purpose of massage is to heal. There are sages who heal without words, prayers or drugs. That's what it's all about. That is the essence. I hadn't thought much of it. - In the healing power? - In the massage, seen like this. I try not to guess too much. Life is better that way. I think I'm rather intuitive. How old are you? - Why do you ask me? - Don't know. And why not ask? If you don't ask, you never know. I'm older than you. Knowing how to use your hands gives you power; ...but in our culture, ...there are too many prejudices about diseases and their cure. We are very cowards, medically speaking. Think about this! When was the last time your doctor touched you? When did your doctor examine you... ...and he touched you. No, those two things have never happened. I don't like doctors. When you ask them, they talk to you on the phone... ...and they prescribe medicines, ...but they don't heal you personally. They let you heal over time or with chemical formulas. I don't like doctors, simply because I don't like them. - How long have you known Doug? - Not much. Long enough for you to be friends? How much time is needed for that? Let's go back to before: to antiquity! - To the massages? - To the massages! Some historians believe that they date from very old. For the Greeks, massage was a treatment. ...which aided healing. There are documents that prove that Socrates and Plato... ...who received massages every day of their lives and lived to be 104 years old. Socrates, no. But the Romans did... ...and Italians today see it that way. They were the first to come up with the idea that massage... ...was a form of prelude to sex. Courtesans became specialists in it: ...being massaged was a part of his job. You don't have to be a genius to find the connection. Massage is sexual, very sexual. It can be, but not necessarily. - Should it always be? - No. But I didn't mean some sweaty, moaning, orgasmic epiphany. Just the fact that lying naked, while someone touches you in those places, ...that surely your father would not allow you to be touched is... ...it's exciting. It's my desk. And a form of communication. I want to make sure that we both use the same language. Well, it looks like everything is ready to go. - We've already started. - What do you mean? The most important thing in a real massage happens in the head. I'm sure you were already preparing. Because? Hurry? No. It's funny, right? Do you want me to play some music? What happened to the music you were listening to before you turned it off? I'm going to put something. I would say we are ready now. Where do we start working, Nina? Any pain or discomfort? Any part of the body that needs special attention? You can start at my neck and end at my feet. My job, you know? You were going to say something like I'm very tense. Douglas always tells me: ... while he touches me: how much tension do you have, ...especially on the back and shoulders! All because of my job. I have a gallery, two actually. One here in the city outside of Melrose... ...and another in New York, Tribeca. One way or the other! Where your work is, there is your creature. You know they always say: "The responsibility falls on your shoulders." You better not talk so much. Was he talking a lot? It's your massage. You can do whatever you want. But, you should try to relax. You can't always be under pressure. Or is it something inherent to the workers? The people I work with achieve relaxation by buying it in a pharmacy. Looks like you're ready. "Angels keep their ancient places. Just turn a stone and they fly away! "It is you, with your puzzled faces, who miss out on that splendorous vision." "Angels keep their old places. "Just turn a stone and they fly! "It is you, with your strange faces "...those of you who miss that splendorous vision". How long have you been doing massages, Fitch? About 20 years with interruptions. # While he was walking through the streets of Laredo # I went to the infirmary of Saint James (Poem by Francis Thompson THE KINGDOM OF GOD) An interesting job! You probably know all kinds of people. It gives you a lot of freedom too, right? I mean, it's very bearable. You carry only one table, you travel well... For my work, I travel a lot. Too much, I'm beginning to think. It obviously depends on how much you want it. Do you like art? Sounds like you're the kind of person who likes it. And what kind of person do I look like? You already know... What are you talking about? I don't know any guy like that ...but maybe, ...you are more aware of me than myself. Well, not the type, but... ...I love art and artists. They hide behind their works. So, to understand his works, ...we need to meet the artist. So... do you enjoy art? Who do you consider to be the greatest artist of this century? What do you mean? Who are the top five? Or all four? Or all three? The truth is that I do not like classifications in art. Would you say that Picasso is the best of all? Or Chagall? I don't think he could... ... value the merits of him. Or maybe Braque or Klee? Where do you want to go, Fitch? What were you saying? You started to say something, but then you stopped. Fitch? Fitch? Fitch? What are you doing? This is not my specialty, just my opinion, but... ...many things have to do with art, contemporary art. If there were any point of reference, from the historical point of view... - Nothing is representative. - I don't agree at all. Modern art is critical. Therein lies its modernity. What are they? I don't know. I found them in the trunk of my car. - Magnets. - Magnets? Its magnetic force is 400 gauss, ideal for places with difficult access. The truth is that you should visit my gallery. Next month there will be a very interesting exhibition, worth seeing. About what? On the history of women's fashion, as a form of slavery. Come and see her! You'll love it. He has a very ironic, satirical point of view. - A point of view! - That is. Let me tell you something: There are so many things in art today that don't make sense, ...that it seems that we and our society suffer... ...of a kind of bankruptcy of the spirit. Well, I'm sure people have said something like that, whenever there has been someone to listen to them. - Yes, but this time it's true. - And before it would be too. THE HEALING PROPERTIES OF MAGNETS WERE KNOWN TO OUR ANCESTORS, BUT, DURING THE MIDDLE AGES THIS KNOWLEDGE WAS LOST. If we talk about today and how we live now, ...what defines us best is fear. - It's yours? - Yeah. The fear of change. The fear of the future. Technology changes things faster than people can perceive. It makes strangers of us all. That is the reason why people create the art that we have today. - A bad thing. - The fact that? Blaming others for existing technology, ...as if we had no responsibility for it. Very good. And you, what do you suggest? I suggest looking at ourselves; ...that, for starters. And only then I suggest looking outside. And all of us sitting like this, cross-legged like fools? It's possible. Why not? Or we can also kill all gallery owners. How about? Where do you exhibit your works? Where do I expose them? Do you have family, Fitch? Wife children? Mother father? They have been dead for a long time. I have a sister in Sydney. I try to keep in touch with my family. It's important, don't you think? My sister is in Boston. My brother is somewhere in Georgia... ...and my parents retired in Florida, but we see each other from time to time. It's important, don't you think? I believe so: the family should be united. Why did you say that? The fact that? The bankruptcy of the spirit. Are you really worried about that? Call it what you want, but the truth is, we've lost our way. As a civilization: spiritually, I mean. Wandering through life, the only thing I learned is that we don't even know what we know. I guess there is also a spiritual side to my work. Each artist is unique. Each one has his own needs. Where do I exhibit? People like me don't exhibit anywhere. I am not a fashion painter. Of course everything has its compensations. People are aware of it, when they come to me. That's usually the reason they come to me. Artists rarely refer... ...to what the gains of others are or should be. Little girl! What is this? It's a Shiatsu thumb, which I use when I'm tired. And what is the spiritual side of your work? It won't be too strong for you, will it, Nina? Why you ask? I had aspirations... ...artistic aspirations. I wanted to see myself on stage ...as an interpreter. The only problem was that she couldn't sing or dance. But I went to do a test. And I realized something: I knew how to sell. So I sold myself... ...and then the tests and trials worked out for me: ...I was accepted. - Have I seen you in a play? - No, you were lucky. And how did you get into the gallery business? As it happens to many who start a job. Falling in love with the wrong person. An artist? Artist, businessman, critic. He was an artist who dealt with artistic things. Get on your knees, head here! What happened to him? Who knows? So? I love what I do, ...how far I've come, ...and who am I? It gives me enormous satisfaction. Are you happy, Fitch? Happy? You said you travel a lot. So he was asking me, has that made you happy? Perhaps, it has made me a better person. I suppose, ...happier than most people and that's important. Being happy is more than achieving happiness. What does that mean? For most people, ...of cultures and civilizations, the idea of ​​happiness is not something trivial. It's not a good job or a new car you drive; ...is something else entirely. Something spiritual? The Hopi Indians... ...believed that the human body and the earth... ...were formed in the same way: ...around an axis. For you and for me, ...this axis... ...is our backbone. And around that axis, ...there are different energy centers. Power centers? There are different very important centers of the body: ...brain, ...throat, ...the solar plexus. But, the most important center of all is the heart. The Hopi say that if you follow a true purpose you have one heart. But, if you allow bad thoughts to enter, then, ...you have two hearts. Tibetans and Hindus believe in almost the same bodily centers. Most interesting is the fact that the Hopi shaman... ...used those same energy centers, ...to heal someone. Know? You can assess someone with just the palm of your hand... ..and you can feel the vibrations in each center. And find which is the strongest and which is the weakest. KOMBUCHA MUSHROOM RELIEVES CHRONIC DISEASES, FROM ARTERIOSCLEROSIS TO FLATULENCE. Sometimes what is wrong... ...is what we call disease. Other times it comes from abroad, ...attracted by the bad thoughts of those who have two hearts. - What is this? - Mushroom tea. It will purify you. And that way, you can see what the source of the problem is. And the Hopi say that the cause of everything is having two hearts. Don't tell me you have one of those crystals in your bag? No. So what causes my pain is having two hearts? This treatment achieves healing. Modern medicine and, if you like, any science, ...is always a belief, ...a religion like any other. Medicine works because we believe in it. - Many times it works. - And many others, no. For this reason, the shaman uses the crystal. This is the crystal of knowledge: ...the shaman's crystal. Through it he looks towards all the centers. They understand themselves ...the Hopi. I still like priests less than doctors. That's because you worship the cult of art, ...which is much closer to the cult of science, ...when you can understand it. Your God is jealous, the most jealous of them all. - The God of reason. - Are you suggesting that I should convert, ...to become a Hopi mystic? Can that be done? Become someone of another race? What we actually do, when we realize it, ...is to renounce one form of mysticism for a more socially acceptable one. I don't know about you, but I have never seen a black hole or anything similar. I don't know if it exists, nor is there a sure way to know. What I do know is that I have seen how the Hopis... ...were cured by a shaman with the contact of his hands... ...and some simple crystals. What arrogance! All I'm saying is... ...all of us have replaced having a belief system... ...for another of disbelief. And you can see that in everything we do and think. We have lost the ability to surprise ourselves. And worst of all, no one knows what's going on. Except you. The Hopis are capable of understanding themselves. I just arrived. What do you think? It doesn't matter what I think. What do you mean it doesn't matter what you think? I want to know your opinion. There is only one reason to dedicate yourself to art: ...you have to start doing it. And you have done it. - So why argue? - Let's go! I want to know what you think. Where have you gone, Fitch, on your travels? To places that sometimes I can remember. For example? Where the spirit wanted to take me: to the Far East, to Africa, ...with the aborigines of Australia. So your massages have gone from one end of the world to another. I envy you that. - Being able to travel the world? - Not having responsibilities. Responsibilities? Of course I have! - Why have you come here today? - And why not? The Far East, Africa, the aborigines... I'm not your style. Doug asked me. He told me that you were different. Oh really? I like him. He said that out of all the people, you were the one who was most... That? ...adrift. Adrift? Those were his words. - Why would you say that? - Doug has that ability. And what does he mean by drifting? With your heart, with your spirit and with your search. And how can he know that, if he's still a boy? It won't be so much, if he thinks so. Turn around! All my life has been the same. Men refuse to see me as I am, ...projecting onto me their ideas of how I should be. And, now, my same masseuse... ...he sees me as someone different from who I am. - And what would that be? -A woman obsessed with her career. And those who, sometimes, when I meet someone I risk taking them to a higher level. He had a better opinion of Douglas. I know he's your friend, but... - I expected more from him. - Was that the risk? - That? -The complexity of it. You would not risk understanding the complexity of another being. - Is complexity dangerous? - Isn't it? It's what you said. Yes it is. Meeting someone always involves risk. - In what sense? - In all. In every possible way. I'm not sure I understand you. I am constantly thinking of you. And is that bad? That's what I was going to ask you. Is everything in your life always so complicated? No, just the important stuff. THOSE WHO CAN SEE THE COLORS OF OUR AURA KNOW WHO WE ARE. Intimacy, whether emotional, intellectual or sexual, ...I think it may be something threatening. Threatening or risky? Semantics, my God! I'm trying to understand what you're saying that Doug couldn't. That's what I deal with. lie down! That's what they are for. The colors, in their silence, are capable of extracting things from you. There is a fundamental difference between men and women. Which is it? The degree of intimacy they are willing to admit. I mean any relationship, not just a romantic or sexual one. And do you believe in that? - Sometimes it happens. - Turn around, slowly! I thought you thought so too. So! Well, I'm not sure there's a big difference. At least I haven't seen it. - Are you trying to turn me on? - If it seems so, it was not my intention. There is something I would like to discuss. What drives men, after sex, ...whether by nature or haste, to run to the door, ...while the woman always stays lying on the bed? Maybe it's because of the differences when having sex with strangers. I haven't said anything about it being between strangers. No matter how excited the man is, ... he will always go to the door, after having had sex with his wife. Clearly you don't know the same man as me. Excellent! And now you see turning slowly. You better have done well. - Show me it! - Good. Come on, show me! Do you like it? How bad are you! What a man wants is an illusion of what a woman is, ...when the man and the woman are together. That idea of ​​yours is still less than an illusion. What are you talking about? To the fact that all men are equal. Am I the same as Doug and Doug the same as...? All men are the same, ...in some fundamental aspects. I know from personal experience. I had two failed marriages, ...before the age of 27. Sure there are differences, but they are not very important! Except for... I want you to pose for me. I want you to see yourself, just as I see you. Except what? Nothing. You don't need to worry about that, you know, Fitch? - Because? - For covering me with the towel. I'm afraid I don't have much modesty. The truth is that I prefer not to wear anything on me. Doug always did that to me. Doug wasn't bothered by the towel thing. Didn't it bother you about the towel? Because he is gay. - Gay? -Doug! -You knew he was gay, right? - Clear. -He told me that you knew. - Yes of course. He is usually very candid about it. Very sincere. That was how we met. He thought I was gay too. A friend, whom he massaged, also thought I was gay. - And you are? - No. But Doug thinks everyone is gay. It's part of the charm of it. I think that, in some very peculiar way, he is bisexual. However, - That? -...still... - Yes? The towel! If you ever want to try something different, ...you could try Shiatsu, ...to stimulate energy in different parts of the body. Oil is not used at all. ...but it is the skin that comes into contact with the skin. You are improving a lot. Be careful not to hurt me. And if I do? You would be the first to suffer the consequences. I will take the risk. I already tried it once. Tell me about your family, Fitch. - Of my family? - From your family, from those who died. There is not much to tell. What was your father? An executive... advertising. My father's family had money; ...my mother's too, not too much, ...but enough money to say they were in good standing. We would dress formally for dinner, ...every Saturday night. Sounds like fun. Sometimes, we had guests: ... some were from my father's agency: a client and his wife. But usually it was just our family: ...my parents, my sister and me. It's funny to talk about roles. My parents had roles that seemed like habits. You can get up now. My father was a real businessman... ...and my mother a patron of the arts; ...which ended up becoming a kind of fixation. In that way? For her it was all the same: classical music, or classical art. It didn't matter what she was or who she was: everything was worthy of admiration. That woman was only capable of admiring; ...she didn't have an ounce of critical spirit in her being. She was the kind of person that television seems made for. One night we were having one of those Saturday dinners, which an important client was going to attend. All men had to wear a black tie. About ten minutes, before the guests arrived, ...I went downstairs well dressed and ready. My father took a look at me... ...and he told me that he didn't like me. Because? For my bow tie. He told me that wearing a clip-on bowtie was absolutely humiliating. And he added that a true gentleman knows how to tie a bow tie... ...and that I looked like a musician. Oh! How old were you? 17. She was not able to make the slightest effort to understand me. Never! And what did you do? Untie my bow tie. - What do you mean? - It wasn't a clip-on bowtie. I had learned to tie my bowtie... ...and he had done it to me so well, in such a perfect way, ...that didn't seem possible. And what happened next? He told me to go away. You can go! - That was it? - That's how it is. Didn't he apologize or...? - Weren't you angry? - No. Stand aside! Nothing? It wasn't a matter of getting angry. Well, what was it? It was a problem of responsibilities and expectations. My mother and father were trapped; ...trapped by responsibilities for things they had never thought of. Trapped by their own expectations. I don't know anyone who hasn't experienced mixed feelings about their parents. They are what they are and you are what they are; ...but it's not like that. I never had hostile feelings towards my parents; What's more, I liked them. I fully accepted them as they were; ...perhaps even more than themselves. ((Francis Thompson. THE KINGDOM OF GOD)) "Angels guard the ancient places, "...turned to stone, they lift up their wing." What's that? I don't know: a poem I knew. It's funny that I remember him now. They're the same, you know, these two songs: "Streets of Laredo" and "St. James Infirmary" Oh really? The story of the songs is the same; ...they just happen in different places. You see it? I do not want to think. Let whatever happen! My family, my parents were rather... ...how would I say?...I think invisible. My father was an engineer... ...and he used to invent lots of things that never saw the light of day. Things like huge industrial machines... ...to work faster and more safely. But he never owned any of his inventions; ...the Company kept them all. Therefore, he never managed to make money from it. And since what he created was a part of other projects, ...nobody outside the company knew anything about him. But he knew how to do things. Maybe he was content to do them. Maybe he wasn't looking for any recognition. Everyone wants to be recognized. The Hopi have a word for it: "Pinu-huy." It means "I am I". Almost the same thing happened with my mother. She had the only acceptable job a woman could have at that time: ...nurse. And she was very good! But like most nurses she was completely ignored... ...and publicly run over by every doctor she worked with. It broke my heart to see two people like them like this, ...of so much talent and dedication. I swore I wouldn't go through it. I guess that was the reason I married Andy. He was an art professor at my university. For someone like me: a girl from the town and 18 years old, ...it was like a release. It took us three years to make up our minds ...but we got married. My parents were very happy. How long were you married? Good question, let's see? ...Two or three weeks. What happened? Despite being so popular in college, my husband... ...he wasn't very honest and he trafficked on the border. And, although today it is difficult to believe, ...I had no idea about it. Hey! What's up guys? Here is everything! He was 18, 19, 20 years old. She was a little girl. You longed to be served! And he was charming ...although, to be honest, not very intelligent. He went through customs too many times. I think I should thank you for not going there on our honeymoon. Yes, the truth is I paid a lot of attention to it. What I did not do with my second husband, ...because, after that, I decided to follow the advice of my parents. I married a very honest, decent and hard-working guy. It was a four year long nap. -There were his mistakes. - But, you learned from them. The truth is, no. Or maybe yes. I've decided that the only men you should seriously consider marrying... ...are those who are already married... ...and who already have experience in it. Let's take a break! SUDDENLY YOU SHINE AND SUDDENLY YOU GO OUT, FIREFLY FRIEND. Chinese Jo It is a type of Japanese acupuncture, ...which uses heat, instead of needles. I'm going to put it here... ...and there, where the nerve is tense. And about you? About me what? Are you married? No. - Never been? - Never. Have you been close to doing it? Maybe, I guess. What do you mean "close"? A serious, important relationship. - I suppose you once had one. - I'd like to believe so. Nothing to do with that old spousal instinct? An instinct? That is what it is? The desire to mate, of course. The desire to mate is not the desire to marry. No, I guess not. Since being in a firing squad is not the same as being... ...in front of him.. Of course. What is marriage anyway? Two people, ...trapped by an uncontrolled passion, ...swearing before God to remain united until the end of their lives. Oh how romantic you are! For me, the result of the experience... ...is not as interesting as the experience itself. How many people really know what passion is? Who was she? How did you meet her? I was trying to run away from myself, she was not. Some people, from the moment they are born, ...they know what their destiny is and they live with it. It's so much a part of them... ...like the color of his eyes. Is it running? She is already. Good. Do not look at me. *I went to Saint James Hospital *to see my girl there. * She was lying on a long white table *so cold, so pale and so beautiful. And then they get older ...because they begin to understand. Understand what? All. You are rich. It's not your fault, ...but that's why you're here. Because you can afford to run away from your problems. What happened to her? People end up breaking up. Not always. They are more than those who do not. When you get to that point you start to wonder what is left. Or maybe you think you've already reached that point. I realized that. At some point you realize that there will be no more surprises. Decide what you want it to do. Make up your mind and tell me! Well surprise me! Where are the variations? Don't know. I don't like surprises or variations. Variations are black leather jockstraps and nipple piercings. Don't think I don't have that. I guess I shouldn't blame people for what they think of me, ...no more than I blame myself. I see things as if it were the first time, looking at you. What things? an empty room, ...a locked door. A lot of what people do is already invented anyway; ...invent themselves... ...and make up their friends. Is that what you did: invent yourself? Didn't you do it? A poor rich boy who went to live with the Indians. Know? The most dangerous thing in the world... ...is thinking you have enough time to play it safe. So that's what it looks like to you? That is what it is. Where do you exhibit? Where do I exhibit? I think you and I are similar. - You know nothing about me! - No? Absolutely nothing. Self-indulgence does not lead to self-actualization. At least I'm not hiding behind anything. Yes you do and in the worst way possible. You hide your soul, because behind these nonsense there is nothing. Am I really an empty room? Yeah. Now too? Do you usually do this, Doug? Tell me? Maybe it's all a matter of... ...perception. The fact that? The problem is not how they see you, ...but how you think they see you. What do you mean? For example, Doug said that you seemed to be drifting; ...but never whether or not you were single, ...or anything else, apart from that initial observation. I'm not sure I understand what you're saying. You like beautiful things. Yeah. - And you have many beautiful things. - A few. But you feel like someone who has failed. Have I said this? No? Are you going to bring me your crystals and tell me that I have two hearts? No. What I believe in is not just bullshit. I know from personal experience. There are people who own many things, but are unhappy. And there are people who live like in a fridge and exchange things with each other. I buy things, I admit it, but I'm not a materialist. Of course not, ...because to me those things don't mean anything. It isn't true; are loaded with memories ...that make them meaningful. They create bonds in people. I often even get angry because of the impulse that leads me to consume. That's because you think that what you buy... ...it will make you younger, happier or sexier. I realize what you're trying to do. You try to convince me how petty I am. - And am I getting it? - No, you're just pissing me off. - Because? - Because, unlike you, ...nobody gave me anything. And I'm not just talking about money. Everything I own or have, I have earned in one way or another. So don't tell me that I'm wrong or that I'm immoral, ...just because I've achieved something in life and you haven't. What have you got? I know that you have achieved something in life; I'm just asking you what. You do not know. Enough already! Do you want to know what is the difference between you and me? Really? That you've spent so much time reflecting on your life, ...that, in the end, you have come to believe it. You are a very lonely man, Fitch. And you let them touch you. - Who? - You're waiting to be touched. I hope who touches me? That's the reason for everything, right? Doug and you. A sexual question, right? Don't know. Did he say something to you, Doug? Oh God! It's obvious, right? I know that to him that means nothing. It is very discreet. He settles for just touching me. A way to have safe sex. And I also try to be... discreet. I never talk to him about it. I just pretend it's part of the massage. And it is so. Every relationship is based on money. I have come to this sad conclusion. I use you, just like you use me. I use you, as you use me and so the thing continues. The question of money... ...is at least somewhat honest. Hi, I'm Nina! After hearing the signal, she can leave her message. Hey Nina! Are you there? It's me, Douglas. You are not going to answer? Hey! I'm sorry I didn't come, but... ...I had a problem and... Actually, I was calling to see if Fitch had come. I knew you were going to like him, because he's a very decent guy and... Don't know. Maybe he's already gone. So... I'll see you next week at the same time and in the same place. OK? Until the next time, beautiful. Bye bye. Won't you be angry? You're sad? Just relax! You are very tense. Well, I can tell you that it has been the most relaxing massage I have ever had. You can bet yes. But I haven't been completely honest. - About what? About men. About men and me. As much as I don't want to accept it, the truth is that I've been involved... ...with many of them. It was always more of the same, I'm sorry to say. In the middle of last year, ...a man suddenly entered my life. And I guess I was completely honest with myself, ... by meddling in his life. An artist. You have to understand that, in my world, a lot is done to get affection. And he was someone who did nothing for affection. He was very genuine, no excuses. He treated me very well; ...better than I treated him. In return, he only expected me to be just myself. Even now? Especially now. Somehow you're acting... ...saying you like my work, sleeping with me now... ...And everything else. You couldn't... give up. A lot of time has passed; ...a long time since my various husbands spoiled my life. It's been... too many things. You don't want to admit how much others influence you; but they do. Maybe they should; that's the key. You have to admit how deeply ingrained they are still in you. We're both the same, aren't we, Fitch? - He has lost control in the curve! - Here it is! There's a woman inside! Miss, is she alright? Miss! We are 2 miles away, on the South Highway. There is a young woman in an unconscious state. I'm going to take her to the hospital. -42. At this time, we are heading towards the Hospital. 42 -Acknowledged. In these curves it is very easy to lose control, you know? I recently went to a place ...that it was a very lonely place, ...empty and hopeless. And I think... ...that there was no escape. I could have stayed there, lost forever. But little by little I began to understand something. That I had decided to stay there and it was up to me to get out of there. I chose to hope and have faith. God should be everything to everyone. To be something less would not be to be perfect, ...but human. What we believe is not as important as believing in something. Don't wait too long to realize you don't believe in anything. How do you feel? Good. Very good. Good. "Angels keep their ancient places. Just turn a stone and they fly away! "It is you, with your puzzled faces, who miss out on that splendorous sight." Is $100 what I owe you? - Did I tell you that? - No. It's what Douglas charges me. So let's leave it at 50. - Take them! - Really! - Take them! - 75? Okay, $75, plus $25 tip. You're not going to give in, are you? - What's that? - Something we all look for. - And what is? - Information. - Over you? - About you and me. And now, ...I want you to concentrate on making sure you don't drop it. You just have to think about it. In not letting it fall. Focus with all your might! When I count to ten, she will fall from your hand... ...and you can't stop it. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... Keep it! Where did you learn that? I saw it once in a movie. I have to go. I would like you to come back next week. - I'm flattered. - I'm being serious. - The same day? - And what about Doug? - What do you want to happen? -He will think that I stole his clientele. - Douglas is young. - And? He won't have a hard time finding someone to replace me. The women like him; that's what you told me. -Well, it's not that he doesn't want to come back. - Want? Yeah. So I'll talk to him. I'll explain the situation and if it's a big problem, you two will come, ...only... not at the same time. Nice to have met you. I hope I wasn't too... - That? -...conflicting. Of course you were. Leave. - Is he running? -He's here. Well, don't look at me. *I went to Saint James Hospital *to see my girl there. * She was laying *on a long white table *so cold, so pale and so beautiful. *Let her go! Let her go! God bless you! * Wherever she goes, she * she will be able to search the whole world, * but she's never going to find anyone sweeter than me. *I went to Saint James Hospital...
