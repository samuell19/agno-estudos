I'LL GO GET HIM. Dorian: IS THIS SOME KIND OF INITIATION? THE KIDS ARE GOING TO DIG THIS. BUZZ MOVES REAL FAST, THOUGH. ALL RIGHT? I MEAN, YOU HAVE GOT TO RUN AROUND THESE KIDS, BECAUSE THE THEORY BEHIND BUZZ BURGER-MATIC IS HE'S A SUPERSONIC ROBOT THAT DELIVERS THE FOOD AT LIGHTNING SPEED. IS THAT THE THEORY, YEAH? YOU CAN'T BE SUPERSONIC, BUT YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT TO WALK AND TALK REAL FAST. OTHERWISE, THE KIDS WON'T BUY IT. DO I GET PAID EXTRA FOR THIS? NO. [MUMBLING] GOT A THEORY ABOUT THAT. WHERE DO I CHANGE, BILLY? THERE'S A FRANCHISE RULE ABOUT DISROBING IN THE REST ROOMS. SO, YOU GOT A CAR OUT HERE? NO. WELL, JUST FIND A PLACE, ALL RIGHT? I'D APPRECIATE IT.

NOW, WHEN HE'S SOBER, I'VE SEEN HIM SHOOT WASPS RIGHT OUT OF THE HOUSE, BUT WHEN HE'S DRUNK, HE GETS STUPID AND ORNERY. YOU SON OF A GUN. Woman: YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE ANY BULLETS IN THAT THING, DID YOU? Red: NO. WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM--A MANIAC? OHH... [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR RADIO] I WAS HELPING TO KICK HIS ASS, AND I BLACKED OUT. [WOMAN TALKING OVER POLICE RADIO] Dorian: WHAT? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? THERE'S A GUY WITH A SHOTGUN AND LITTLE KIDS EVERYWHERE. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO? YOU PULL SOME KARATE MOVE ON A BIG, FAT DRUNK GUY? AND YOU'RE WEARING A DAMN CLOWN SUIT? ROBOT SUIT. LIKE WE NEED THE PUBLICITY. I MEAN, WHY COULDN'T YOU JUST COWER LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE? DID YOU PRESS CHARGES? NO. GUY'S WIFE BEAT ME TO IT. GOOD. WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT TODAY? NOTHING MUCH.

YOU GET TO STAY HOME FROM SCHOOL TOMORROW. NO, NO. I'M GOING TO GO IN THERE AND CLEAR THIS WHOLE THING UP. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT, ANGUS. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT, ALL RIGHT? I'M ALREADY IN THERE AND EVERYTHING, SO I'LL JUST KEEP NOSING AROUND FOR US. MA BETTER NOT FIND OUT ABOUT THIS. Angus: MA... WE'RE HOME. YOU, UH... LOOKING FOR SOMETHING? PROPHYLACTICS. RAINBOW-COLORED ONES, AT THAT. THEY'RE NOT YOURS. NO. NO, MA'AM. NO. NO. NO, THEY BELONG TO YOUR ROTTEN STEPFATHER, NOT FOR MY BENEFIT, OBVIOUSLY. I NEVER FELT ANY RAINBOWS. OH, NOW, MOM... YOU DON'T NEED TO-- THEY HAVEN'T BEEN OPENED. WELL, I COULD ONLY ASSUME THAT WHORE OF HIS PREFERRED THINGS AU NATUREL. MOM, WAS THERE, UH, WAS THERE SOMETHING THAT WE COULD HELP YOU FIND? GET THAT DAMN DOG OUT OF HERE! GRITS! COME ON, GRITS! COME ON. YOUR STEPFATHER GAVE YOU THAT DOG, DIDN'T HE? YEAH...WHY? MOM, WAS THERE SOMETHING WE COULD HELP YOU FIND IN PARTICULAR? UH...ARTIFACTS OF YOUR STEPFATHER IN GENERAL... A WOMAN'S ADDRESS IN PARTICULAR. I WANT TO KNOW WHO THAT JEZEBEL WAS THAT HENRY WAS SEEING. JEZEBEL. THAT'S A GOOD ONE, MOM. ODDLY ENOUGH, I DREAMT ABOUT HER LAST NIGHT. I COULDN'T SEE HER FACE CLEARLY FOR, OF COURSE, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE, BUT IT WAS HER. I GATHERED THAT SHE WAS CAUCASIAN, AND THIS WAS AN INTERESTING OBSERVATION BECAUSE HER BODY WAS BLACK. SHE HAD THE BODY OF A HUGE, HAIRY, BLACK ANT, A QUEEN ANT. ABOUT AS BIG AS A BUS, I WOULD SAY. JUST A DREAM, BUT A DISTURBED ONE. WHAT DID--WHAT DID THE BIG ANT DO, MOM? DORIAN, I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU WOULD USE A KLEENEX. I RAISED YOU BETTER THAN THAT. I'M JUST SCRATCHING. DAMN IT. SHE SHAMED MY FAMILY. WELL, WE'LL-- WE'LL FIND HER, MOM. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. WHOA! WHAT ARE WE--THE MAFIA? NOT ANOTHER ONE. MOM! THIS IS A REAL BAD IDEA. I'M SERIOUS. ANGUS, I--I CAN'T STRESS THAT ENOUGH. BIG ANTS? BIG ANTS? I REALLY DON'T LIKE IT WHEN SHE TALKS LIKE THAT. IT'S DISTURBING, YOU KNOW? I MEAN, I JUST HOPE SHE DOESN'T TALK LIKE THAT AROUND HER FRIENDS BECAUSE JUNK LIKE THAT AIN'T GONNA GET HER ELECTED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE D.A.R. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? YEAH, WELL, SHE'S FINE. IT'S WEIRD. HEY, YOU REMEMBER THAT STORY ABOUT THE WOMAN THAT BASHED HER HUSBAND'S HEAD IN WITH A FROZEN LEG OF LAMB, THEN COOKED IT UP AND SERVED IT TO THE DETECTIVES? NO EVIDENCE! I MEAN, THAT'S PRETTY CREATIVE. BUT I'M THINKING THAT THE PERFECT MURDER WOULD BE SOMETHING MORE PEDESTRIAN, THOUGH, SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE LIKE A HOUSEHOLD ACCIDENT, LIKE A FAULTY GAS STOVE OR SOMETHING. YOU KNOW, WHEN WE FIND THIS WOMAN, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HER. I MEAN, I'M GUESSING SHE DOESN'T HAVE SOME KIND OF CONVENIENT HEART CONDITION LIKE OLD HENRY DID. WHAT? NO, HEY, LISTEN. NO MORE. ALL RIGHT? LEAVE ME OUT OF IT. WE CAN LET MOM CARRY OUT HER OWN VENDETTAS. Angus: SHH! [DOOR CLOSES] [SIGHS] I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE WE'RE OVERTHINKING THIS WHOLE THING. I MEAN, WHY DON'T WE JUST FIND THIS WOMAN, POP HER IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD WITH A .22, AND TAKE HER SOMEPLACE NO ONE WILL EVER FIND HER? WHAT? Billy: MAN, THIS THING GONE THROUGH THE GRILL HOOD AND THE CEMENT BEAM. Sally: GOOD MORNING! MORNING, DARLING. I HOPE THINGS ARE BETTER FOR YOU TODAY. THEY ARE. Billy: DORIAN! Dorian: YES, SIR.

Rick: NOW YOU SET IT UP IN THE FLOWBY, PUT IT ON THE SIDES, GO AROUND. NOW, I'M JUST GOING TO DO THE SIDES. SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO GO AROUND AND DO THE BACK, TOO. IT'S YOUR OWN PERSONAL PREFERENCE. THIS IS THE WAY I LIKE TO DO MINE. NOW, WHEN YOU DO THIS WITH THE FLOWBY, YOU'RE GOING TO GET SOMETHING... AHH! ANGUS, WHERE ARE THE COPS GOING TO THINK THAT ALL THE CARBON MONOXIDE CAME FROM, HUH? A FAULTY GAS STOVE, A FAULTY FURNACE. THIS KIND OF THING HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. IT'S ALL ELECTRIC! LISTEN, I GOT 2 WORDS FOR YOU: VITAS GERULAITIS. YEAH, WELL, I GOT 2 WORDS FOR YOU, TOO. Angus: NO.

Rick: AND WITH ME I HAVE VARIOUS PEOPLE HERE THAT HAVE USED THE FLOWBY FOR YEARS... ...SO WHAT DO I DO WHEN I NEED A QUICK HAIRCUT? Audience: USE THE FLOWBY! Rick: THAT'S RIGHT. THIS IS WHAT I DO WHEN I CUT MY HAIR... [SOFTLY] YOU CAN'T BE TOUCHING EVERYTHING. YOU'LL GET FINGERPRINTS ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU'RE NOT EVEN WEARING GLOVES. Rick: I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE A 2-INCH CUT, NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS. WHEN I DO THE FRONT, I LIKE TO HAVE THE FRONT A LITTLE LONGER RIGHT IN HERE, SO WHEN I'M BOUNCING THE FLOWBY UP AND DOWN, INSTEAD OF ROLLING IT OVER LIKE THIS... [ANGUS INHALES DEEPLY] ...THEN WHEN I DO THE SIDES, I'M JUST GOING TO GO ALL OVER... [ANGUS GROANS] COME ON, WAKE UP. WAKE UP. WAKE UP, DORIAN. [COUGHING] [CANISTER CLANGING AGAINST TRACKS] Beatrice: NO, NOT HER. HOW DO YOU KNOW? OH, PLEASE. DID YOU SEE HOW THICK HER ANKLES ARE? GIRL STOMPS AROUND IN A COUPLE OF CORNED-BEEF CANS. [SOFTLY] OH, GOD. NOPE. I WOULD HAVE KNOWN. I WOULD HAVE SMELLED IT ON HER. BESIDES, SHE'S A LESBIAN. SO SHE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE ONE HENRY WAS SEEING. UH-UH. NO. NEXT TIME USE YOUR HEAD BEFORE YOU TRY TO KILL SOMEONE. DORIAN, I'M GLAD YOU WERE THINKING. I SAVED HIS LIFE. YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO IF YOU'D BEEN AT THE RIGHT HOUSE.
