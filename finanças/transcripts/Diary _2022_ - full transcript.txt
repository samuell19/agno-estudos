Are we on the mountain? Long ago. It's been five minutes since we crossed Parali river. I'm still sleepy. I'm going back to sleep. Come on, you sleep all the time. At least make an effort to appreciate nature. Only you can appreciate nature during late night. You can appreciate it all you want. Hey... We're about to reach the 13th hair-pin bend. So what? You're not aware, aren't you? At the 13th hair-pin bend, a lady awaits holding her infant in her arms. She hitchhikes by stopping the vehicles that pass by. If she realizes that they won't stop for her... she'll fall in front of the vehicle along with her child. When you stop to see what happened to her... no one will be seen behind the vehicle. You could've just asked me not to sleep. Instead you scared the hell out of me. I've never brought you here during late nights. - Now watch. - I won't ride with you anymore. Get lost! Look we're approaching the 13th hair-pin bend. Oh, God, I'm not looking at anything. Spare me the horror! [News] On the way to Ooty from Mettupalayam, at the 13th hairpin-bend the number of accidents have been increased. The Ooty Police has requested the people to be cautious while taking this road. Moreover, there have been many mysterious stories surrounding these accidents. [woman] We don't go for a drive towards that 13th hair-pin bend past 10 PM. We're scared 'cause of the many haunting stories we heard. [man] Sir, this is superstition. People tend to spin stories. Don't believe in it. [man 2] When you're near that bend, you'd feel as if someone is calling out for you. If you make the mistake by stepping out of the car... there's no guarantee that you'd be alive. [man 3] Our eyes can only witness the present. The past and future will be right beside us. But it won't be visible to everyone. [reporter] Many mysterious stories that are told about the 13th hair-pin bend not sure how many more incidents may occur or would they be able to solve the mystery? This question is lingering between... the habitats of Ooty and the tourists that visit. -Officers! -[all] Yes, sir! Congratulations on becoming Sub-Inspectors of Police. My best wishes! If the people of our nation are blessed with a peaceful sleep... because we stay awake to protect them. I'm not trying to glorify. I'm saying this so that you'll know what your duty is. There are many unresolved cases that has hinder our duties. The count of unresolved cases with no evidence in Tamilnadu has no bounds. The files you see out here belong to those unresolved cases. This is your first assignment. You can choose any case you want. This assignment may prove to be a turning point in your career. "Give me 100 brave young men "I'll change the fate of our nation." Quoted, Swami Vivekanada. I'm not asking you to change the fate of our nation. A few are skeptical about our department. Change that disbelief. That's enough! You can choose your files. Move it! The have a huge load of pending cases. But asking us to resolve them under the pretense of assignment. Varadha, what case are you going to choose? I'm going to pick with my eyes closed. I'm okay with anything. Super idea. Go for it! Varadha... What's your case? A honeymoon couple was killed in a hotel at Ooty. It's been 16 years but has not been resolved. Yeah, last month... a husband was crying that his wife was murdered. I saw that on news. I believe this happens quite often in Ooty. Anyway, you got a good case. All the best, Varadha. The danger involved during the investigation of new cases is less. Whereas the cases that were sidelined without evidence... when reopened for investigation pose grave danger. You must be very careful. Today onwards you all will be given a gun for your safety. As this would be the first time you'll be carrying a gun... you should very careful in handing it. Pertaining to the case you can investigate anyone you'd like. Also you can arrest anyone if need be. But you can only do it through the police officer stationed in that jurisdiction. By evening all your details will reach the concerning police stations. The power to affect your future lies within your own hands. Wishing you all the very best, my boys! I want excellence from everybody. Just do it! [officer] Listen, bring me the file. Madam, first file a complaint. Come over here! Varadhan Annadurai, sir! I've already received a fax. Not sure what's wrong with the department officials? They trouble us by assigning unresolved cases to the rookies. I have assigned a Sub-Inspector to assist you in this case. You have to seek her permission. Don't try to be a hero. If you do then I'll send a report to end the investigation. Hey, Aasai! Yes... sir! Stop hissing like a snake. Take him to the SI. Excuse me, sir. Vehicle? I'll drive myself. Do as I say. I wonder who'll be his next victim. Are you related to the Sub-Inspector? No. - Or are you here to file a complaint? - No! Just asking to know why you are here? What's your problem? You are a driver, right? Let's go! Hello! Hello! Hello! I don't have a problem. It's a problem to the entire station. Why? Sub-Inspector is weird. Weird as in? Eventually you'll understand. That was quick. Mini-Vijayashanthi entry! ♪ If the girl gives an angry look ♪ ♪ Bullets fly without the pistol ♪ Trying to act smart with the police, is it? No, ma'am! - Who are you? - He's here to meet you, sister. I meant to say, madam. - Varadhan Annadurai? - Yes. Listen, complete the formalities and prep him for remand. - I have to take him to the court. - Okay, madam. - Please sit. - That was some heavy beatings. Thank you. I asked the training sub-inspector to sit down. I thought you asked me to sit. Please sit. Thanks. - I'm Pavithra Krishnan. - Hello. I'll be assisting you in the investigation of this case. And I believe I'll be the driver. Sorry madam, I got carried away. - These are your case files. - Thank you, madam. - You can call me, Pavithra. - Thanks, Pavithra. Damn, he's good at scoring. Is it possible to meet any of the officers who had investigated this case? Officers from this case are not stationed here anymore. But there's one constable who resides near Katteri falls. Oh, is it possible to meet him? Sure, I'll try. I noticed you while beating up that accused. You looked very scared. Madam, I think he's yet to experience the horror. If he witness it he'll be shivering his pants. Soon you'll be wearing the police uniform. Make sure you shed the fear. I'm advising you as an senior officer. That's all. Shall I try calling her Pavithra too? Pav-- Oh, no! I was about to say you might hurt him bad. Madam, beyond this we can't go by vehicle. - If we try? - We'll be dead. It's a narrow path. We have to go by foot. The main reason why no one succeeded in finding an evidence... is nothing but department's negligence. The investigated only in the Nilgiri district. What makes you say that? People from different states in India visit Ooty. So, it's evident that no one from Ooty has committed this crime. I don't understand why they were so careless about this case. Oh, God, by the time we resolve this case... I'll be dead meat. - 16 years ago... - Will it take longer? We still have more places to visit... We couldn't resolve this one case that happened 16 years ago. We tried every possible method. A criminal usually leaves a trace without his own knowledge... We all know that for a fact. Still... we couldn't find any evidence. Neither we were able to resolve the case. Before I retired I prepared all these documents. This has everything you need. Beyond this I have nothing more to offer you. - Fine, let's try elsewhere. - Hey, shut up! A sudden dip in respect! Did you send out these reports to all the police stations? Gudalur, Coonoor, Kotagiri, Mettupalayam, Coimbatore we sent out the reports to all the stations. But it was of no use. They're incapable of handling the cases under their jurisdiction. It's obvious that they won't pay heed to the other cases. I'll tell you something. Don't mind me. If you build walls on all four sides... then there's no point in finding a way out of it. It's better you pick another case. Despite there are walls built on all four sides... we should break the roof to find the criminal. That's what the Police are here for. He meant to say, if you had some brains... you could've cracked the case. - But you are my inspiration. - Why son? After retiring from the department... single-handedly I wish to swindle entire wealth and settle down in a place like this. Just like you did. His face looks like SpongeBob SquarePants. Officially let's send out this case details to all the states. Perhaps the criminal is in prison. Or might've committed a crime and roaming free. But definitely we'll find a clue. We are rookies in the department. More experienced officers have handle this case before. They would've approached it like we did too. When we read a book twice... we end up understanding things that we didn't earlier. Agreed, that we are rookies. Only rookies keep learning. A month ago... you arrested someone for killing the wife of a honeymoon couple. Do you think this case would have something to do with it? When you arrived at the station I was stomping a guy... He killed his own wife and created the drama. You look beautiful when you smile. You're good at lying. Let's go. Excuse me! I don't think you're here to resolve this case. I feel you're here to impress her. I'll start the vehicle. Hello! Hello, please hear me out. That's my spot.

It's all the same, madam. Madam, I have a small doubt. What do I do to become like you? You'd need a surgery. Madam! Madam! Madam! Since evening, my daughter has gone missing. We looked for her everywhere. Madam, we checked with all our relatives too. - No clue about her. - Please don't cry. - Tell me calmly. - Madam has an urgent thing to tend to. You can file a complaint with him. Madam, you please carry on. Madam, you carry on. I'll handle this. Over here. Please sit down. - Sir, it's a missing case. - Sir, my daughter is missing. - Come on, sit down. - Speak up! She was playing outside the house... When will it arrive mom? Wait a bit longer. They'll get it for you. Someone's stealing that uncle's car-- We have personally called 750 stations across India. No response. This case presented itself to me. I feel even the clue will find its way to me. Tell me, Akshaya. Hey, Varadha, I'm working on a murder case at Kumbakonnam police station. From the case details you sent over... this too seemed to have occurred in the same pattern. What makes you say that? This group loots only gold. Not just the murder pattern even the motive is the same. Somewhat similar to your case. Did you arrest the accused? They've added two men as prime accused. Valangaiman Jayakumar and Thirunageshwaran Anand. But we have no clue about their whereabouts. I feel that we both are looking for the same accused. I would like to meet their family members. Sure, Varadha. When are you coming? I'm leaving right away. I'll be there in the morning. Okay sure. Come. Anything urgent? A similar murder happened in Kumbakkonam too. From what my friend Akshaya mentioned... both the murders must have been committed by the same person. What if it was a different person? How can you be so assured? The first thing they teach us during training... to investigate considering the suspect as the culprit. Only then it'll give us a lead. - Good luck! - Thank you. What happened, Varadha? I parked my car right here. It's missing. Zoom in! This is the camera from the parking lot. Freeze! Sathya! He's a thieving rascal. He must've fled to Coonoor via shortcut in the car. You don't worry. I'll take care it. You take a bus to Kumbakkonam. By the time you return your car will be at the station. My gun is inside the car. Moreover, the entire analysis of this case is inside the car. Damn it! Aasai! TN 23 CP 4183 This is Varadhan Annadurai's car. Car has been jacked by Sathya. Control room, Kotagiri route and Coonoor route. Alert all the check-posts. Listen... Listen, it felt like someone came into the room. No one is going to enter a locked room. Please get back to bed. Oh, God no! What happened? It felt like someone was boarding the bus along with me. Climb up. Dear... where are you headed? I'm heading to Tirupur, old lady. Are you traveling alone? Why didn't your husband come along? My husband is no more. I have a son. He's in the 3rd grade. He means the world to me. Where do you work? I work at Tirupur clothing company. I have to make it to the 1st shift in the morning. That's why I am leaving now. They arrive on time to snag a free cup of tea. Nowadays there's no proper schedule for the buses to arrive. Have we ever questioned you about the integrity of your tea? Listen, he gives us free tea. That's why he's rambling. When will you start the bus? Old lady, had it been your private bus, we can start right away. This is a government bus. It runs on a laid back schedule. - What's with the old lady? - Ignore her. Dear, where are you? Sweetie, don't panic! I have arrived at the bus stand. Before the rooster calls out I'll be in front you. The wedding is in the morning. If you don't make it on time you'd regret! Except for me no one would dare to marry you. I'm packing weapons to handle any kind of situation. What kind of weapons, my dear? Not the kind you think it to be. This is different. Understood? Okay, dear. Please get here sooner. I'd suggest you to hug a pillow thinking it's me and sleep peacefully. And I'll present myself to you in the morning. - Okay? - Okay, dear. Cute girl. Until you get here-- Dear, what happened? Dear, please say something. What happened? Why did you scream? Dear? Hello? Dear, please say something. I'm really scared. Sweetie! A beggar literally scared the hell out of me. Oh, no! He looks like mangled Chris Gayle. ♪ - My dear warrior. All set to hunt... ♪ - Who's singing? - It's me singing. - Oh, it's you! I'm singing so that you're not scared. I'm starting to cry. Masilamani, don't fear. Get going! COIMBATORE - Where are you headed? - Three tickets to Coimbatore. - Old lady, where to? - One ticket to Coimbatore. Do you think it's a fake? I printed these counterfeit currencies. The entire Ooty market runs on my counterfeit currencies. Don't get worked up. I had a doubt 'cause it looked crisp. They make us run a trip for just 4 tickets. It's not like you're working for free. You're getting paid, right? Dad is asleep. Let's leave before he wakes up. Watch your step. Let's escape before anyone sees us. The bus is arriving. Stop the bus! - Check out. - Thank goodness we made it on time. - Once you reach hostel, call me. - Sure, dad. - Be careful. - Sure. Take care of your belongings. Eat on time. - Call me if you need anything. - Sure, dad. Please take care of her. She's traveling alone. I'll take care of her like my own daughter. Not to worry. You get home safe. Get going! Hey, boss is coming. Get up. Hey, come on everyone gather. Boss, what happened? My daughter eloped. She was in her room half an hour ago. She wouldn't have crossed our area yet. Boss, shall I inform the police? You expect me to bring shame on myself? Why the hell do I have you guys? Boss, we'll only return after we get hold of them. Go! Senthil... - Boss? - When you see them don't talk. Hack them to death. I'll handle the rest. I'll return only after killing them. - Hey, hop on everyone. - Hurry up! We should return only after capturing them. You have beautiful lips. Why should you-- - Dear! - Sweetie. - Haven't you left yet? - You better get to sleep. Look, there's a passenger. The bus has arrived. I'll arrive promptly before you wake up. - Just close my eyes? - Yeah, just the eyes. I won't let anything else to happen. Stop being skeptical. You please hang up, sweetie. Damn, his face is long like a race course. Stop staring! Look, a lion-tail monkey. Hello! Hey! Oh, God! Bloody moron! Get up and move aside. - Hey, there's so much space out there. - So? This isn't your private property. Move, damn it! Bloody moron! Are you looking for weapons? Shall I? Shall I take out my weapons? Just on my way here I dropped someone dead. I was born bearing weapons. If I use my weapons you'd stand no chance. I'll sweep you off the ground. Enough with the weapons rant. First buy a ticket. - Where are you headed? - Karamadai. Here you go! What's wrong with him? He gave me more change. It's his loss. I get it the bus does not have a TV. What about a stereo? A bus may pass by. It might play music. Listen to it. Sounds about right. I'm going to sleep. Wake me up when a bus passes by. I need to listen to music. - For his two cents he expects too much. - Hello! Coimbatore sarcasm, is it? Here you go. You may leave. Hey, I asked you to leave. Now scram! Madam, look over there. Let's check with him. Did you see Car-Sathya? I just saw him going to Kothandan's garage. How do we get there? Go left and then right then once again take a left then again a U turn from there... - Put him inside the jeep. - Then again a right... - Sir, sir, sir, sir! - That's hard to remember. - Let go of me. - Get inside the jeep. - What's your name? - Gokul. Change it to Google. Let's go, sir! Hurry up! - Don't panic. Give it to me. - Here you go. Hey, why did you panic on seeing the police vehicle? You guys look suspicious. Are you guys thieves? Why don't you say something? Mr. Bald, don't you dare close your eyes. It'll be hard to spot a difference between your face and head. That's right. Maintain that look. - Watch your step. - Brother. You may leave. I'll call you once I reach. Okay brother. Your brother just pulled over a bus and made us get on it. It wouldn't have cost him a lot to drop us at Mettupalayam. Let go. He must've been on duty. - Where are you headed? - Thudiyalur. Come aboard. Don't you ever ask me to come to Ooty again. What happened, Malik? Oh, God! Hey, give me the doll. Hey, give me back my doll. Hey! Mom, she doesn't share the doll with me. Fine, you play with this. Driver! Are you an ardent fan of Thala (Ajith Kumar)? You're driving extremely fast. Please drive slow. I'm panicking. Incorrigible people. Listen, if he drives so slow... when do I reach and when do I do my sweetie-- I meant to say, get married. Please ask him to drive faster. This is hilly region. Only if he drives slow we can reach our destination alive. If not you sweetie will be done by-- - What did you say? - Don't make me say it. Do you expect me to hear from someone else? You better say it. Hello! Hello! Fine, tell me who is, Thala? Did you just ask me, who is Thala? Don't tell anyone that you asked this question. They will kill you! - Go! - Perhaps he's a dreadful don. Don? Maybe he's a Thalapathy (Vijay) fanatic. Let's find out. How dare he asks who is Thala? It's disheartening, folks. Damn it! Sister! - Is there game on your phone? - Yes! May I play a game? He should not get caught by the monkey. If he gets caught he'll die! Awesome, sister! My father's phone has only snake game. Now you have to run again. Hey, check over there! Check on the other side. Look, there's some movement over there. Damn, he jumps like a pro. Watch your step. What happened? Hey, I can see a bus coming. Hey, listen! Please stop the bus. Sir! Sir, please sir. Uncle... Uncle. I see a couple of them running towards the bus. Sir, please stop the bus. Sir, please sir. Who are these people? Moron! Drives slowly on the road but speeds up on the bumps. Check what's happening out there? Sir, stop the bus. Sir, people are chasing to kill us. Sir, please. Let us board the bus. They're chasing us down to kill. Sir, please sir. Sir, please start the bus. What do we do now? You first start the bus. Check if you could see any vehicle coming this way. - Boss! - Did you catch them? Not sure where they went. We are looking for them. They should not get off the hill. Put our men at all the check-posts. Check every vehicles at all the entry and exit points. Don't worry they can't escape from us. I will handle them. Don't let them getaway. Hey, everyone get in. Drive to Wellington. Come on, hurry up. Hey, stop toying around. Call her father right away! Hey, what the hell are you doing? How did she get in? Kill her, damn it! Hey, where's the bag that was inside the car? I have no clue about the bag. He sold the car and took the bag with him. Where did he go? No idea madam. Parents had filed a missing person complaint in Ooty. This is the missing girl. Inform our station and handover the girl to her parents. Okay, madam. Show me your face. Sir, may I have the car key to complete the formalities. Sir, Sathya must be lurking in this area. Please follow me. Take everyone to the station. - I'll be there soon. - Okay, sir. We know each other from our school days. Since then we were good friends. After we joined college our friendship... turned into love. People always love to hear others' stories. I liked him since we were in school. But I never expressed it. But when he professed his love... I could not say no to him. Therefore, I said okay to him immediately. The moment she professed her feelings for me... I went and spoke to my father. Because my father is my best friend. He said, he's okay if I like her. He told after graduation get a nice job and then get married. I thought of doing the same. And went to my father and told him about our relationship. It doesn't feel wrong when I go every nook and corner to ask people to vote for me. But when it's the question of love... the heart doesn't agree to it. It must be a disease. An incurable disease! He did not agree to it. What else do you expect from your father? If I say something they'd call me a fool. Now focus on your studies. Once I land a job after graduation... I believed her family will accept me. So, we focused on studies. But... Hey! Hey, let go of him. That's enough. Stop beating him. Let it go. Stop, that's enough. Why are you guys pounding on him? Instead bring his father who didn't know how to raise his son. Don't cry. Stop crying and tell us what happened? Sir, my father was an innocent soul. Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! They smashed his head and killed him right in front of my eyes. When he was about to die... He was looking at me when he was about to die. When I was a child... my mother passed away. My father was everything to me. He was living only for my sake. But they killed him. After that they picked a guy from our relations... and fixed my marriage with him. The wedding is scheduled on Sunday. He lost the only relation he had. So, I decided to be his companion for life and eloped from the house. I couldn't see any other viable option. Fine, now please stop crying. You see, if you start running from your problems... the problems will continue to haunt you. But if you face them with courage... all your problems will vanish into thin air. Understood? Finally, the bus has arrived. Brother, I'm a lawyer. Don't you fret. I'll handle if you get into any problem. [speaking tribal language] Everything will be fine. [continues to speak in tribal language] You don't have to be scared of anything. They're Todas tribe people from the forest. Check if everyone is aboard. Hold on, I'm checking. - Is everyone aboard? - Get going! - Where are you headed? - Six tickets to... Where are you going to stay? How are you going to manage the expenses? That's why I took 200 sovereigns of gold from house. We will have to use this for expenses. 200 sovereigns-- Now that's a responsible girl. But my girl is hopeless. She's fit for nothing. If you don't get married... you'll definitely encounter problems. First thing in the morning get married. After that no one can harm you. Why wait till tomorrow? Let's get them married now. If two hearts come together... traditions are just an excuse. What do you say? There's a deity's temple at the next stop. - It's a powerful deity. - He's absolutely right. The board member has spoken. The chaos is about to begin. One of the most gracious deity. Get married at that temple. It's for your own good. That's right. I too feel it's the right thing to do. It's enough there are a handful of good souls are there to bless you. You don't need anything else. Everything will be good. So, what do you both have to say? Shall we get you both married? Even the grumpy has agreed to it. What do you say? - Let's do it! - Great! Hey! Hey! Hey! Conductor, is this a Govt. bus or a Govt. marriage hall? You're planning at your will. If I don't arrive by 6 AM, my sweetie will commit suicide. To fulfill their new beginning don't end mine. Once the wedding is over, you have to start the bus in 5 minutes. Okay? He's an incorrigible being. As if he's the result of years of penance. Get going! We've arrived at the temple. Everyone get off the bus. Only today I get the job satisfaction. Old lady? Old lady? She's in deep sleep. They look as if they're statues. One second. Come on. Please you too join us. What's happening? Where did everyone go? You are marrying the girl of your dreams... that means you have conquered the world. Forget about your worries. Be happy. Dear Deity, please guard this young couple. Son, hold this. You too hold it, dear. Hey, why do you still have a long face? Be happy and put the garland on her. No way, he's having second thoughts. I don't think he's going to do it. Let's go.

Gran, we just got them married. How could you forget so soon? She's has no clue about it. We are returning from a different wedding. Hey, start the vehicle. Can't you keep your mouth shut? Always ranting something or the other. Poor kids, let them be happy after the wedding. We just prayed for their well-being. But you blabbed about them to those men. Can't you keep your mouth shut? Die, damn it! Where are you headed so late in the night? I'm going somewhere. Why do you care? Tell my father that I will never return home. Listen, he didn't mean what he said. - Please come back home. - Mom, please hang up. Who is she staring at? Perhaps she's staring at the saint. - One ticket to Periyanaickenpalayam. - Give me change. Sure! Let's take them with us. They're going to stay with us. That's great, dad. Let the couple stay with us. Old lady, I've noticed you since I boarded the bus... you've been acting weird. Looks like you saw a ghost... Yes, I did see a ghost. I'm saying this with a smile on my face... please don't talk about it anymore. I'm telling the truth, damn it. There's a supernatural power inside this bus. Have you gone mad? I told you not to talk about it. Can't you keep your mouth shut? Stay silent. I'm telling the truth. - Trust me-- - Shut up old lady! - Don't talk about it. - I'm telling the truth. There's a supernatural power inside this bus. Hey, I said shut up your mouth. She looks dreadful as it is. Scaring me with ghost stories. Maybe she's telling the truth. Old lady... Are you telling the truth? Try to smell... - You want me to smell? - Do you smell something? Yes old lady. I do smell something. - What smell is that? - It's smell of screw pine. It likes the smell of it. It has possessed one of the passengers. Are your hands shivering? In fact, they're frozen! That means it's standing next to you. And it has been touching you all this while. - Touching me? - Yes. Is that a ghost? Or something else? Things that has to happen at my age didn't happen. What do I do if the ghost is touching me? Why should I live anymore? Don't turn around. It will smack you. Now what is she staring at? Why is she staring at that girl? I wonder what it is? Let me check. My dear lord, please guard me from evil. I'm really scared! Girl? Girl?! - I wonder what happened to him? - It's okay you get back to sleep. Old lady... there's something on this bus. You're right. It's there on the bus. On every last bus from every place... they travel along with us. And now it's on this bus too. - Happy married life. - Thank you, sister. It looks good. Okay, where are you headed? I'm going to Karamadai. If I don't arrive by morning, my lover will commit suicide. I'm a virgin, old lady. That's a pity. You're talking about me, right? Not you I was talking about your lover. Why do you say so? It's 'cause you'll die on this bus. Oh, no, even she looks scary. Is there no way out of this? Hey, the duty is over. If you get sloshed when do we get back home? A bison might attack us. A bison will not attack another bison, sir. Being a Govt. official has become very hard these days. I think the bison has arrived. Everyone scram! It's very cold tonight. What took them so long? There's an angel standing out there to save us. Once the bus halts let's run for our lives. - Hey, stop the bus. - Hey, what the hell are you doing? Fear made me do it. Now just get off the bus. - You didn't buy a ticket? - Are you serious? If I die then there's no use of buying a ticket. - Sir, please hear us out. - Govt. is already running on loss. - There's a supernatural power. - Don't cheat. - I'll put you behind the bars. - Trust me! This shortbread doesn't seem to understand. Sir, we're not running away. We are right here. Hey, let me talk. You don't seem to shut up. Stop blabbering! - Sir, there's a ghost inside the bus. - Yes, sir. I'm not scared of any ghost. First you both buy tickets. Let him face the ghost. Climbing a bus feels like I'm climbing a mountain. You're scared of a child's doll. Aren't you ashamed? This guy is impossible. My ill fate! It's a nice doll. Here's your doll, kid. Thank you, uncle! Dad, that uncle got scared looking at me. Who was it? How was the meeting? Sir, you forgot your bag. Nothing to worry. Get back to sleep. Bloody scared chicken. I did buy the ticket. Why is he rolling on the floor? Hey! Hey! I think the supernatural power attacked him. Not sure if the ghost is inside the bus or with me? Then go inside the bus. Don't come along! - Aren't you coming? - This is my destination. Bloody moron! I'll crack open your head. - To hell with this bus. - Hey, get going. Old lady, I think that kid is the ghost. Perhaps it's the ghost or she's possessed. If she's the ghost, how do we save the passengers? Are you serious about saving them? We can't spot the difference between the ghost and humans. There's a police station nearby. File a complaint, they'll take care of it. So, you mean to say both the humans and ghost are inside the bus? Great, it's the police. - Sir, please stop the car. - Sir, please stop! - Sir, sir, sir, sir... - Wait and watch what I'm going to do. - Sir, there's a ghost... - Bloody fool! You lovers didn't find another means to commit suicide? Sir, this is not the time for comedy. This is not Super Singer for you to sing. What happened? That's right. There's a supernatural power inside the bus. I did see it. I'm sure the ghost must be scared of you. Hey, stop kidding around. We're saying there's a ghost inside the bus. But you've been behaving like a fool. Hold on, why is he getting worked up? Sir, we saved ourselves... it's in your hands to save the people on the bus. That's all I can say. Let go of me. I'm leaving. - Gandhimathi, don't leave. - Stop sassing her, damn it. Car-Sathya might have taken a bus too. Sir, there's something inside the bus. It's better you check out the place they mentioned. Meanwhile, I'll check what's happening on the bus. - Okay. - Careful. Hey, get inside the jeep. - Why do you want me to come? - To take care of you. He's calling you to solve the case. Sir, once again on the bus... Aasai, hurry up, start the car. - Hey, don't sleep. - Damn! Hey! Uncle... Why are you taking that sister's bag? - Hey, keep the bag down. - Hey, stop the bus. - Hey, stop the bus. - Give me my bag. Give me the bag! Hey, what is happening? Hey, Jayakumar, throw that bag to me. - Here you go. Catch! - Where you leaving with the bag? Hey, stop the bus! If you don't I'll slit the kid's throat. Hey, stop the bus! Hey, everyone get back to their seats. Hey, I said everyone get back to their seats. - Hey, get off the bus. - I'm coming! Hey! I'll slash you. Give me the bag. Damn, that's a huge weapon! Let's pretend to be crazy. Auntie, gave it to me for shaving. Oh, God, that hurts! We can't go uphill, sir. Let's handover them to Mettupalayam police. Driver, start the bus. Why is he staring at the glass? Perhaps he could see the ghost like I did. It could be. - What's your name? - Jayakumar. Your name? - Sitarasu, sir. - Anand, sir. Valangaiman Jayakumar and Thirunageshwaran Anand. I feel we're looking for the same accused. Hey, where did you loot these jewels? Come on, tell me. Where did you steal from? Tell me! Hey, tell me. Come on, confess! Come on say it. - Say it! - I'll confess, sir. We stole from a hotel in Ooty. Which hotel in Ooty? I don't know the name of the hotel. It's a hotel nearby Rose Garden. Where exactly in the hotel? Tell me! We stole from a room at the hotel. What about the people inside that room? - Say it! - I'm telling! We killed them, sir. You killed them? Murdering people? How dare you murder people? How did you kill them? Show me your hand? Damn, the weapons weigh as much as I do. Conductor, why did you leave this in my hand? Sir, I better shift to the front. Ooty police station! - Sir, this is Varadhan speaking. - Tell me, sir. Sir, three men in Ooty burgled at a hotel nearby rose garden. Also, they've killed the people inside that hotel room. I have arrested the accused. Sir, you're indulging in a case that doesn't concern you. The main evidence in my case were jewels. These burglars posses those jewels. This case concerns me. Okay, sir. Tell which hotel is it? They don't know the name of the hotel. There are more than 100 hotels nearby rose garden. How do you expect me to search? Sir, you please call all the hotels and ask them to check. - You too check them out in person. - Sure, sir. Where are the accused you arrested? In an hour I'm taking the the accused to Mettupalayam station. Before I leave I'll inform the inspector. Okay! Hey, Puli Pandi, get up and wake up everyone. Hurry up. We got to leave. Control room, there has been a murder near rose garden. Come on, hurry up everyone. Driver, take us to the rose garden. Hello! Hello! Hello! How many rooms are there in this hotel? - 101 rooms. - Show us all the rooms. Is there a problem, sir? - That doesn't concern you. - Okay, sir. Go ahead. Go inside that room and check. - How many rooms in this hotel? - 110 rooms. Are all the rooms occupied? Take us over there. We need to check. Sir, it was getting drenched in rain at the bus stand. I put the dog inside the bus. Mom, why did this uncle get scared of the dog? He was not aware of it. That's why he got scared. Dad, I could hear the puppy the entire time. Sir. She's a ghost, sir. The girl next to you. Me? No need, sir. Why sir? This guy could never stop staring. Take a look at her, sir. Why is he staring? You should not open your mouth until the bus halts. Get lost. I wonder why are you pretending not to have seen the ghost? - Sir, behind me. - What is it? Behind me, sir. Listen. I'm already petrified. If you speak another word, I'll shoot you. Am I the only one who is seeing the ghost? Perhaps I'm hallucinating. This man is not letting me sleep in peace. Not sure why am I having a bad day. Everyone is out to smack me. I'm getting beaten up for speaking the truth. Hey, untie the knot. Hey, baldie shut up! Hey, untie the knot. I'm going to thrash you. Shut up. Hey, untie the knot. The hell, you don't get it, do you? What is it? Oh, no, once again I'm in trouble. If I speak the truth he'll shoot me in the throat. Nothing much, sir. I had a nightmare that my lover slit her throat. Nothing more. If hear a sound you too will die. Thank you, sir. Oh, no, instead looking for my lover... had I gone behind Gandhimathi, I would've lived. Gandhimathi, I miss you. - Hey! - Here he goes again. - Dear Lord, please save me from him! - Untie me! - Hey, untie the knot! - Hey! Aren't you a ghost? Untie yourself. My dear lord, I never harmed anyone. It's not a sin to have wished to get married. Stop staring! His ghostly face looked way better. Tell me, Pavithra. I looked everywhere. I can't find him. TN 43 N 0715 This bus departed at 12 AM from Ooty to Coimbatore. This is the last bus. I need the details of this bus. - Anything wrong? - It looks unusual. I'll head to Coonoor transport and check. You take down the details of the passengers. Okay. Please check as soon as possible. Yeah, okay. - Aasai! - Yes, madam. - Start the vehicle. - Ready, madam. - Girl? - That's it! Girl? Now he's going to scream out loud. I'm going to close my ears. Hey, girl! What happened? Why are you panicking? - What is your name? - Lizzie, sir. Maybe the ghost killed him. Oh, he's still alive. - Are you traveling alone? - My dad came to drop me. I stay at a hostel in Salem and study. It'll be dawn by the time I reach. I'll got to the school then I'll go to the hostel. This is my usual route. You look very scared. Is there a problem? Sir, I dreamt something bad is about to happen to the people in this bus. You shot someone in this bus with your gun. That's why I'm scared. If he's going to use a gun... it's no one but me. I'm dead! Me? I don't even have a gun. Hello? Hello? - What is it? - What is your name? This is not a question you ask after you wake up a person. I can't tell you my name. Get going. Here you go. - Are you coming form Ooty? - No, from Aruvankadu. My brother is a sub-inspector at Aruvankadu police station. We usually visit during the holidays. We're heading back home now. Yes uncle. Thinking of school tomorrow is quite scary. - Uncle, you're a police officer, right? - Yes. When I become a successful police officer you should salute me. Definitely, I'll salute you. - You? - I am Meenakshi. I work at Tirupur clothing company. I am coming from Ooty. I stay behind Alankar theatre. Hey! Rascal! Rascal! How dare you touch her? Get in the front. Get going! - Your name? - Ezhil, sir. Raghavi. They are lovers, sir. They have eloped. People of this bus gathered... and got them married at the deity's temple on our way here. What does your dad do for living? He's the MLA of Ooty. Ooty MLA? Damn you people I'm going to die a virgin. Dear, where have you reached? Sweetie, I'm still on the bus. You better take poison and die. I'm not going to make it. Why would you say that? - I'll die. They're going to kill me. - When? They're about to kill me soon. Oh, no, dear! Hey, how could you be so cool about taking the MLA's daughter on a bus? Sir, we didn't have another option to escape. Do you peg the MLA to be a fool to let you escape on a bus? Listen, you're off duty. What are you doing out there in cold? I'm here 'cause I couldn't bear your nagging. - Hello? - Stop torturing me. Tell me, madam. I need details on the bus number, TN-43-N-0715 0 7 1 5... It's too much for him during midnight. He's here to escape the nagging from his wife. He's searching as if a blind cat is looking for treats in the dark. 831, not this one... Madam, there's no bus under that license plate. Perhaps you gave me the wrong number. No, that's the exact number. The last bus that left from Ooty at midnight. - Midnight? - Yes. The last bus from Ooty is at 11 PM. The next bus is only at 5 AM in the morning. I think you're talking about another bus. What if the bus was delayed? Not a chance, ma'am. I already got the information that the bus has reached Coimbatore. Shit! How dare you steal a police officer's car? - How dare you? - Sir! - Bloody thief! - Sir, stop it. What did he do wrong that you're beating him up? Just 'cause you're police you can't beat him up. He's a wanted thief. There are a lot of cases filed on him. How dare he steals a police officer's car? Brother, why would you do it? Oh, no! You look exactly like my brother. I'm sure your mother didn't raise you to see as a thief. I too have a son. He's 8 years old. He aspires to become a successful collector. So, I'm slogging to provide him with the education. Your parents too must've slogged to raise you as well. Please don't repeat this mistake. Get up. Come on, get up. You shot someone in this bus with your gun. That's why I'm scared. He's definitely going to shoot me. Everyone gather around. Search each and every room. Did you check the IDs of the guests? Show me the rooms. Sir, we don't let the guests stay without verifying the IDs. - Are all the rooms occupied? - Yes, sir. Do all the CCTV cameras work in your hotel? Sir, they are working properly. I hope everything is good. And there are no issues. As of now there is no problem. If there's a problem I'll definitely inform you. Oh, shit! I'm not able to reach him over the phone. Please drive faster. - Who's staying inside this room? - Newly married couple. - Are they inside? - They're probably inside. Sir, why are you disturbing us so late at night? - Tell me, Pavithra. - Varadhan, where are you? I'm about to reach Parali river. The last bus was at 11 PM. The bus you're traveling is not on the records. Immediately, ask all the passengers to get off the bus. I'm on my way. May I have your ID card? Come on, drive faster. Keep at it. Faster! Pull over in front of the bus! Go and hack down the driver and the conductor. Go ahead. Cover all the exits. Who are these people? They're carrying weapons with them. Kill that bloody conductor. Sir, they work for my father. They're here to kill us. Please, sir save us from them. Quick, get on the bus. Brother, I spotted the girl. - Please sir. - Come on, do something. Hold on a minute. Listen, we got them married. Hereafter, you can't do anything about it. Shut up you woman! Hey, take them out! - Boss! - Tell me. The people on the bus got your daughter married to him. What did you just say? Hey, who gave them the right to do it? Don't spare anyone on that bus. Kill them all! Kill them all! Hey! Raghavi! Raghavi! Hey! Hey! Oh, no! Raghavi! Raghavi! Raghavi Hey! Look at me. Raghavi! Raghavi! Enough staring at everyone. Kill everyone on the bus! First, kill him! Hey! Dad! Pugazhendi! Pugazhendi, there are too many of them. Start the bus. Come on, start the bus. Mom, I'm scared! Dad! Dad! Hey, kid hold tight! Kid! Come on, don't be scared. Hold on tight! Dear, hold my hand. - Dad! - Dear... - Dear, hold my hand. - Dad, I'm scared. Please come to me. Hold tight... Let go! Oh, God no! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Hold my hand. Come on, hold my hand. Come on! Come on! Come on, move back. - You please climb up. - Hurry up! You go ahead. Don't die trying to save my life. - You please climb up. - Please save the kids. Please listen to me. Hey, get up and leave! Sir, I'm not coming. Get out and throw me the rope. Be careful! Hey, hold the rope. - Let go of the girl's leg. - Let go! - Give it to me. - Let go. Girl, you leave from here. Come on, leave! Sir, hold the rope. Throw that rope to the kid. Throw the rope to the kid! - Hold my hand. - Give me your hand. - Come on! - Climb up! - Keep moving. - Come on, hurry up! Dear... Everyone hold tight! Hold my hand! Hold it! Hey, baldie untie me. I said untie me. Untie me damn it! Hold the bag. I'll go and untie him. Don't do it. We'll gain one share. Sir, I don't care for my life. But please save my children lives. Give me your hand kid. No one move! Please don't move. Stay put! Please save my daughter. - Kid, climb up! - Dear, please go to him. - Go! - Hold me tight. Come on! - Give him your hand, dear. - Come on! Dear, give him your hand! - Give me your hand. - Give him your hand. - Dear, give him your hand. - Hold my hand! The bus is hanging at the edge. If we stay we'll die too. What do we do now? Give me your hand. Give me your hand, kid. Come on! Hold my hand! That's it, hold my hand. Climb up! Give me your hand. Please move back. Sweetie. Clear the crowd. I'm sorry I could not make it to stop your wedding. The bus I was on met with a dangerous accident. Dear, please come safe. I called off the wedding. [news] The police and the rescue team have been searching since last night. But there's no clue about what happened to the passengers and the bus. If the passengers are found, for their treatment... a group of doctors have camped at the site. Many people have gathered due to the incident and it has created a frenzy. Sir we looked in every direction. If there's something it should be on this side. Sir, there's nothing out here. Hey, check on the other side. Sir! There's something out here. [news] A wreckage of a bus has been found in Parali river... on which there are many human skeletons. Not sure how many years ago this bus drowned. By the looks of the skeletons found on the bus... it's looks like it belonged to the passengers on the bus. To proceed further concern officials will take over the investigation. It seems as though it belonged to the passengers of the bus. This is Anita, from BBC with cameraman, Aravind Singh. Sir, does this mean except for the boy... the other passengers on that bus were dead already? Sir, that was my mother. I have only one son. He's in 3rd grade. You go ahead. Don't die trying to save my life. When I was a child my mother left for work to Tirupur. Despite many efforts we couldn't find her. I had a doubt that she looked like my mother. I'm sure she's my mother, sir. Mom! How can I help you? I need the bus details of TN 43 N 0715 Please take a seat. The last bus from Ooty to Coimbatore that departed in February 2000. After that it went missing. Since then there has been no information about that bus. 16 years ago, the murder happened inside this room. Due to that murder our hotel's reputation took a toll. Sir, two weeks ago you too came here... for an investigation regarding the same case. What happened to the passengers on that bus? No idea how many were on board. In 2000, an inspector from Aruvankadu... helped his brother and his family board the bus. That was the last piece of information we received about that bus. You're right, sir. It's been 16 years! I dropped them to the bus in my department vehicle... and helped my brother and his family board the bus. As the bus disappeared... they disappeared too. It's been 16 years, the police department has no clue about it. Gudalur, Coonoor, Kotagiri, Mettupalayam, Coimbatore we sent out the reports to all the stations. But it was of no use. Did no one from the missing families approached you? For 7 years if we don't get information on the missing person... as per law they're declared dead. We got an information about an old bus that was recovered at the Parali river. Maybe, it is the bus that went missing. Yesterday, we recovered a bus at the Parali river. That's the bus your brother traveled in. - You mean to say, the passengers... - Oh, God no! I thought they must be happily living at some corner of the world. I thought they'd return one day. But that's not gonna happen. One second, sir. This is the couple that got murdered 16 years ago. Here are the driver and the conductor of the missing bus. Varadha, what's happening? Creation Recapture. What does it mean? In 2000 an exact incident took place. During that incident all the passengers inside the bus died. Now the same incident is being repeated again and again. Does that mean anyone who boards in the present too shall die? They can escape if they get off before the bus meets with an accident. Had you not boarded the bus, what would've happened? Everyone on that bus must've got together... and indulged in a fight with the MLA's henchmen. I'm finding it hard to believe. We won't believe... until we are directly connected in a supernatural occurrence. This is not something new. There has been similar occurrences in other parts of the world. But this is the first time in our country. Why don't search "Bus 375" on Google? Then you would understand. In 2000 February... a honeymoon couple was murdered in Wood Oak Hotel. I came to Ooty to investigate the case that was pending for 16 years. The accused in that case were, Jayakumar, Anand and Sitarasu from Kumbakkonam. All three accused died on the bus that met with an accident. - He's a good detective. - You first brush your teeth. What makes you so sure about it? You got it all from the skeletons? - Right! - That's a good one. Laugh! Okay, I'll tell you all about another true incident. In 2000, Ooty MLA Gunasekaran's daughter, Raghavi... eloped from the house with a guy named Ezhil. When they eloped they took the last bus from Ooty to Coimbatore. And the passengers on that bus got them married. During the same year, 2000... six people died run over by an unidentified vehicle. The six people belonged to Todas tribe in Ooty. Gunasekaran's men killed them 'cause they got his daughter married. Not just that. His men chased down the bus... and while trying to kill everyone on that bus the bus met with an accident killing everyone on the bus. It's hard to believe. You're narrating as if you were on that bus. I did witness it. Take a look at it. This is Gunasekaran's missing daughter, Raghavi and her lover, Ezhil. Can't believe, right? But that's the truth! Despite me telling the truth if you still don't believe me... you can go with your team and investigate, Gunasekaran. There's a reason why rookies are asked to investigate a case. Because only the young are oblivious to fear. 16 years have passed. I believed no one would dig out old graves. But this young man is here along with evidence. Sir, there's no expiry date for a crime committed. Whenever the case gets resolved you're bound to get caught. Young man, I'm a politician. I know how to get out from a sticky situation. Shall we? POLICE ATROCITIES DOWN! DOWN! [reporter] Sir, sir, sir. One minute. Sir, you've been accused of many crimes. What do you have to say about it? Sir, please answer. Sir, do you agree to all the allegations? - What do you want to know? - Sir, please tell us. This is a conspiracy by the opposition party. I will fight this through legal means... and prove myself innocent. Sir, do you think you can save your post as a Minister? Sir, please answer this question. Sir, one minute. Sir, you can't leave without giving an answer. [reporter] As the minister refused to answer any questions... we suspect that the allegations on the Minister could be true. During the gathering in the evening... [news] In 2000, former Nilgiri MLA, Gunasekaran... has been arrested for the death of passengers from the missing bus. This has led to losing his post as a minister. For resolving the case that was pending for 16 years... people have been showering appreciation on the police department. [news] As this was the 1st incident that took place at the 13th hair-pin bend... people now believe that the mystery surrounding it has been resolved. I was aware of the mysterious incidents that took place at the 13th hair-pin bend. I'm obligated to tell you about an important incident. I was heading to Coimbatore to tend to a medical emergency. On my way I found a car that met with an accident... at the 13th hair-pin bend. Father... They're dead, father. Jesus! Just when I thought, is there no one who could solve the mysterious deaths at the 13th hair-pin bend. I noticed a life start to breathe. On that day, I met you for the first time. Father, he's severely injured. We have to take him to the hospital right away. Inside the car there was a picture of your mother and father. I have kept it in this diary. Whenever you asked me about your parents... I always wanted to tell you the truth. But now is the right time. By the looks of it... everything looks abnormal, Varadha. There's a purpose why this case got assigned to you. Incidents that take place in the present... are a construct of the past. That's my opinion. A diary construes all kinds of emotions of a person. But the diary I hold answered many clueless questions. We can't stop time. But I understood that time can take us anywhere. As the years passed, I wrote more diaries. Expecting the bus to show up again... I waited for many days at the bus stand and at the 13th hair-pin bend. But the bus never showed up. I believe it served its purpose. Everything should should be fine. - When is your wedding? - 13th of the next month. I'll come home tomorrow and formally invite you. - Tomorrow? - Why do you sound shocked? Do you have any important work tomorrow? Tomorrow is my parents 20th death anniversary. - Oh! - It's okay. I'll be there. You can come home. It's not enough that we just think about our parents. It's imperative to complete all the necessary rituals... that'll bring peace to their souls. You better take your family right away to Rameshwaram temple. I'll come home another day to invite. Fine, I'll go to Rameshwaram tomorrow... I'll pray to the deities and complete the rituals. - Okay, Varadha take care. - Take care. You said your parents died in an accident on February 29th, 2000. Yes... It's the same date the bus met with an accident too. Daddy, there are a lot of colors in it. Please tell me which one to pick. Close your eyes and pick one. I'm going to pick eyes closed. That's what dad and mom picked for you. As you say, daddy. I have another theory too. The bus went missing on February 29th, 2000. And you saw the bus on February 29th, 2016. This is leap year. It comes once in 4 years. Today is February 29th, 2020. There's a chance it could arrive today. Grandpa! Grandma! - Sir, where are you headed? - Mettupalayam. You can take this bus, sir. Please come. Sir! Sir! Sir! Mom, sir! I've been waiting daily for this bus. Only today it has arrived. Please, sir let me in. Please, sir. Please, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Why are you standing?
