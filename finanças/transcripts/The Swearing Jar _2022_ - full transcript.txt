[sighing] Well, Lavinia is a character from a Shakespeare play. Perfect, it'll make us sound smart. [Simon] She had her hands hacked off and her tongue cut out. See, that right there is why I don't like Shakespeare. Yeah, you always stick to the comedies. There's fewer amputations. "How happy some o'er other some can be. Through Athens I am thought as fair as she." Um, why do you know that? I trod the boards. Yeah, a few times in high school. That is a shameless lie. It is not a lie! I never lie. Midsummer Night's Dream, tenth grade. Winter's Tale, eleventh grade. Midsummer Night's Dream, twelfth grade. Were you the donkey? I'll have you know that I won the Holy Blessed Sacrament's Dramatic Arts Award for my portrayal... of a young lover. - I... I am very proud of you. - Thank you. Why haven't you bragged about this before? Because, I... [clearing throat] ...played Helena. - Excuse me? - I played Helena! [laughing] It was an all-boys school and I was skinny. And had rosy cheeks and a demure disposition. Oh, my God, can you please do another one. Absolutely not. I will let you win the next three fights. - "And I, an old turtle." - You played a turtle? What? No. It's a metaphor. It's from The Winter's Tale. "And I, an old turtle, - will wing me..." - Turtles can't fly. I believe Mr. Shakespeare is referring to a turtle dove. Well then why doesn't he just say - turtle dove? - Oh, God. "And I, an old turtle, will wing me to some withered bough, and there, my mate... that's never to be found again, lament... till I am lost." [Carey giggling] That's enough couple time for me. I like that quote. - Will you write it down for me? - Aha! A born-again fan of the bard. Wait, wait, wait. Come on, where are you going? I need to wing me to school, where 36 minds are waiting to be shaped. - On a Saturday? - Yeah, we have band practice. Oh, I wasn't aware that band could shape minds. Huh. Wait! I wanna give you something. - No! - [Simon] Yes! - No. - Please, please, please. - No! - I'm not gonna do anything. I don't trust you, even a little bit. [Simon] I won't do anything. Come here. Here. [kiss smacks] What was that for? I just haven't kissed you in a while. You kissed me this morning. - Shh. - Ew. [laughs] Shakespeare is... Shakespeare is depressing. Don't be depressing. - =Be this guy. - [Simon] Hmm. Yeah, you know that's me, right? Yeah, look how happy you are with your big, white teeth. Ah, the better to eat you with. - Ew.

It's so nice to see you. I... I can't think of anything he'd need to tell you. Especially not now, this month. What's the news? Yeah, Simon, what's the news? You... [groaning] Um... you know, that, uh, we've decided to, uh... you know, to get some help. With, uh, the... baby making.

You will be a wonderful mother. - Oh, thank you. - [Bev] Thank goodness. Because if he's anything like his father, you'll be bringing it up alone. - Excuse me? - [Bev] What? He abandoned us. And that kind of thing can be genetic. He didn't abandon us, he died. He did that, too. [Simon] Okay, you know what, this has been great. You should really invite yourself over more often.

I mean literally hun... hundreds. - Sounds exhausting. - Uh-huh. Secrets. Secrets killed the marriage. Now, I know... that he is not a good communicator. But that just means that you have to try.

Okay. Uh, thanks. So... [Dr. Rose chuckling] [Dr. Rose] Looks like your due date is actually... - November 12th. - [chuckling] That's my mother's birthday. Yay. We'll do a quick examination and then we'll look into finding you an OBGYN. - Okay. - [Dr. Rose] All right. [bittersweet music plays] [Carey] That's mature. Why were you so rude in there? Honestly, I'd rather wait until... Are you going through something? Am I... wow. I mean, is there something on your mind? Huh, I don't know, what's on my mind, episiotomies, placenta, giant effing needles - in my spine. - Come on. Loss of bowel control, ripping of any kind. I don't even like children. - You're a teacher. - Exactly. So I know. They're manipulative and they're too stupid to even hide it. They're us, but worse. Why would I wanna go through all that...

We've been ready for two years. I know, I... I just... I don't wanna feel like I'm doing this - all by myself. - You're not. You're not, you... [groaning] You could. What? You could. You could do it by yourself. - So could I. - That's what I'm talking about. It is weird to say that to your pregnant wife. [Simon] I have never wanted anything this much in my entire life. Then why are you being weird? How? How? How? Please, tell me how I'm being weird. You're... [sighing] You're being so nice all the time, and you're not maintaining eye contact. Carey, Carey. Please.

Swear to me that everything is okay, that we're gonna be okay. - Oh, my God, okay, I swear. - Make it official. - [she laughs] - What? [Carey] Make it official.

I mean, it's... it's like this. [Carey laughing] It's not good. Can we please not think about it. - I don't wanna think about. - [Carey laughing] [both] I'm sorry. [Carey humming] [guitar strumming] What are you humming? - Hm? - What are you humming? What is that? It's stuck in my head. I, uh... I have been playing around with some lyrics and I thought that we could, uh, maybe... maybe sing it last. So, you've been playing around with lyrics to my song? Huh? Hm? - Isn't that a collaboration? - [Carey] Shh. Shh. I think, technically, that would be called... God, I love you. [Carey] Um... um... if, uh, if you wanna back out, I understand. I can accompany myself. [Owen] No, you can't. Owen, it is too soon to be telling each other that we... You introduced me to your daughter. [Carey] You showed up to my house. Don't do that. So, what... what? Is this not going anywhere, or are we just screwing? Screwing? [scoffs] What? Y... you make it sound like we're... [Owen] Having an affair? That's what it feels like. We are having an affair. Don't you understand that? I am cheating on him. He's dead, Carey. He's gone. [Carey] Don't say stuff like that. It's true, it's been three years, - and pain for you... - If you say move on, I will punch you in the crotch. I was gonna say be happy. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. But you have nothing to feel guilty about. I regret it. Okay? I regret giving you my card and I regret sleeping with you. - That's nice. Thanks. - [Carey] No, you're amazing. You... you... do things... That's not the point. I'm so... Everything was going so well. My job was fine. I'm a reasonably good mother. I don't cry every day. It took me so long to find my way, and when I'm with you I just- I feel like I'm... I'm lost. What's wrong with being lost? [Carey] As many of you know, today would've been Simon's 40th birthday. I would probably have teased him for being old. But he was also, undeniably, much too young. Um, before we finish off I would like to thank this amazing man, Owen. [audience whistling & applauding] For playing and singing so beautifully. I couldn't have done this without him. Any of it. Uh, it's been three years since Simon and I started this. I'm half proud and half horrified to say that, even after throwing this party, it still contains 2700 dollars. [audience laughing] The remainder of which will go towards a vacation for myself and my daughter, Gretchen. - [man] Aw. - Gretchen, it... How old are you? How old are you, Peanut? [audience chuckling] Close enough. Yeah. - [audience chuckling] - Um... last but not least, uh... I would like to thank Simon... for bringing joy into my life for 12 years. And the lives of everyone he met for 37 years. Happy birthday, my love. [Simon exhales sharply Hey. Hi. [Simon] When did you get home? Since when did you take afternoon naps, old timer? [Simon] Hm. I had a wicked headache. Wicked. [chuckling] Are you okay now? Yeah. Are yous okay? [Carey] Did, uh, today's headache damage the grammatical part of your brain? [Carey] Oh, yes. We's is fine. Me and Rachel. - [Simon] Gretchen. - Rachel. - [Simon] Too tired to fight. - [Carey chuckles] Score! Well, if anything ever happens to me... I'm not having this conversation. I want you to take a vow of celibacy. [laughing quietly] You are the love of my life, you asshole. That's five dollars, please. It's in the kitchen, and it's already full, so... I wouldn't want you to be alone, you know that, right? I swear I will never, ever love anyone else. [emotional instrumental] Hm...
