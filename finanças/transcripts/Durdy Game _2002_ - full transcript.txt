It's like, everything just went perfect. And I just feel like, you know, we clicked so good, you know. - But. - But I ain't, you know, I haven't been too honest with you. And I feel, you know, if we going to see each other, whatever that I need to be truthful. - Look Freshy, just don't even, you don't even have to say it. - Just hear me out. - Look, I've heard this shit so many times before. Unfortunately, I really already know what the hell you're gonna say. - But look, I wanted to still see each other ma. - Freshy, you know, I thought you were different. - Meek, just hear me out. - No. Whatever Freshy. You no different. Just like them. - Meeka. Baby what's wrong? What's bothering you? - Ma what's wrong with me? I don't understand. It's like I can't find a guy who wants to be with me and only me. I'm tired of being the other woman. I'm tired of it. Coa found a guy, why can't I? I mean, what's wrong with me? - Meeka baby don't cry. Don't cry. Listen, let mommy tell you something just about 85% of the successful men that's out here today, whether black, white or whatever race for that matter. Got kids, got a wife and another woman on the side and maybe another man, you just don't know. Meeka being married and having a family just may not be in God's will for a lot of us today. - I don't understand Ma. I thought that that's what life is supposed to be all about. You know, having kids, having a husband, having a family, you know what I mean. - No baby, life is about enjoying yourself honey. Living stress free as possible, taking one day at a time, 'cause tomorrow's not promised to us. I mean, being a man's wife or woman or whatever you wanna call it is fine. But what I had to realize is that we're all fighting for that position. And once we get it, another woman or man will come along and get that same love if not more. - I don't understand. I don't understand what you're trying to say. - Meeka baby you remember when you was a little girl and you fell out with me because your father told you that I said I didn't want him to come home with us. Remember that? - Yeah. - Yeah. Well the truth is baby, your daddy he couldn't come home with us because he had another situation before me and I was what you called the other woman. - Why ain't you ever tell me this before? - Baby you was just too young. You was just too young to understand. Now I don't want you to get it twisted. You could be married and still be miserable, but your mommy was okay. I just wanted more out of your father. I wanted more from him. Being the other woman's not the worst thing in the world. Just don't stop fighting to be his one and only. - I won't. I won't I promise. And I'm so sorry for being distant and ignorant towards you all these years. I'm sorry. I love you. - Oh yeah. That's what I'm talking about. So I believe there's two type of people in this world. People who make things happen and people who watch things happen. Baby we about to make some things happen. - Is that right? - That's right. You can believe that. - I got a question. - Talk to me, babe. - Why are you sitting so far away? - Oh, that's your question. Well, I got the answer right here. - Is that my phone? - Yeah, but you don't need the phone right now. You don't need the phone. This our time. I'm sitting so far away.
