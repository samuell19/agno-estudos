This bungalow belongs to Rajesh. He is very rich. Owner of mills and factories. He has everything one wishes for lnspite of all this he is restless. What is it that troubles him? ''The three worlds are the abode of Lord Vasudeo'' ''At the same time, all the worlds are contained within Him'' ''l salute thee, Oh! Lord Vasudeo'' Here Sir! - How are you? Fine Sir. - Good morning sir! Look at his elegant walk! This is not the progress of Vijay lndustry alone... but that of the entire nation. All developing countries require sincere and honest people. Our products get a wide market all over the world! l announce a bonus of four months salary to my staff. You will repent when they go on strike! What did you say? You should not praise them, or they get spoilt Servant class is a low class. Distance should be maintained! l'm advising you because l'm your family friend That is the reason l never say a word to you. Here comes Girdharilal! What do you want? Here are twenty thousand for the wood l sold from your forest Only twenty thousand! You are cheating You are insulting an old worker. Ask for forgiveness Forgiveness! - Yes! Alright! l'm sorry Girdharilal Collect it from the cashier - Alright. There is a request - Go ahead... lt's time to cut the forest. Why don't you come down sometime? l shall definitely come one day. Your car is ready. Your race is in the evening l know it. Thank you. Down with Raja Sahab! No one can stop me now l swear by my daughter, l will kill you one day! l am Govind. Remember me! l have bandaged your foot. Don't walk barefoot again! Thank you doctor. - Goodbye! Shekhar, take your breakfast and leave the car alone. l shall win the car race. l will beat even Rajesh! How dare you use such words? - Mother, it's just a game! One shouldn't forget one's position Your father was Raja Sahab's servant. lt is due to him that you will become a doctor. But Rajesh himself has invited me. - That is his kindness! Your duty is to see that he wins and not defeat him. Sit down Aarti! - Why are you getting upset father? Aarti and Shekhar study together. Aarti likes Shekhar! You like that beggar? Raja Sahab should be my son-in-law! l've seen him since childhood. We have good relations with his family. You shouldn't think of anyone else! Don't even think of Shekhar! Buck up Raja Sahab! Look at your Shekhar! Buck up Shekhar! - Shut up you fools! What's wrong father? Are you alright? You are foolish to support Shekhar who has been brought up by Raja Sahab How could the idiot dare to compete with Raja Sahab himself? You deserve this cup Shekhar. But l fail to understand, what made you retreat after a fine lead? Because of the favors l have done on you... l cannot repay your debts in an ordinary race Then? Being born in a poor family makes one patient and strong. l realized you were not happy with my victory You are not used to defeat. So l withdraw my car You left me far behind due to your sacrifice. To be in power and victorious is a incurable disease There is a great difference between you and me. You are happy in your defeat, whereas l'm not, even in my victory lt is your greatness that you think in this manner Being wealthy you have consideration for the poor The poor are happy because they get a sound sleep l'm being chased by loneliness in this huge house l lost my parents long ago. l have only you to call my own But l'm afraid that l might hurt your feelings due to my nature l assure you, this won't happen Listen... - Yes... Stay with me for a few days... lt might improve my condition What you need is a good wife who shall understand you better Where is she? - Have you searched for one? No, but l have a picture in mind. l want a simple girl. l'll recognize her immediately. You'll be the first one to know l promise to get her to your house as a bride. l'm very happy son, that you lost purposely He is more happy than you are. He asked me to stay with him ln his house? Yes, but l told him that l'll have to ask my mother We have so many obligations. Do anything to keep him happy l cannot do that. - Why? l feel there is something that tortures him. You have been defeated once again by your friend Why are you asking him to stay with you? l will give you company. Get rid of him! The way you got rid of Babu, your childhood friend l'm tired of these shadows. Babu will never forgive me l committed a mistake in childhood and l am suffering even now l am not worth anybody's love. l am not worth anybody's friendship l am repenting. l want peace.

Look inside the cupboard You will find an album and a doll. Get them here This doll is called Meena! - What? This is why l was shocked when you said your name was Meena This is the photo of my childhood friend Babu Where is he now?. - He is dead He tried to snatch away my doll. - What happened then? l killed him! - Just for a doll? The doll was the most precious thing in my life lt belonged to my childhood friend whose name was also Meena One day l was told that she was sick l went to see her, but she was dead. They gave me her doll to pacify me The doll became a part of my life. l used to carry her everywhere One day l was building a castle of sand for her, on the seashore Babu ran with her. l ran after him wildly l asked him to return my doll. Ultimately l caught him l started beating him mercilessly. He begged of me to leave him l chased him to a hill-top and pushed him He shrieked and died. l was taken to the court But the law could not convict a child of my age. But the devil in me still curses me. The demon is yet alive. That day when Shekhar was staring at you the devil in me wanted to kill him too. l know he is honest and faithful. You're a symbol of purity and devotion. l dislike these hands. l hate them! Please don't hurt yourself. You will overcome your grief. You are playing a dangerous game! You are cheating Rajesh. Rajesh loves you with a true heart. lt is your duty to tell him the truth. He killed his friend for a doll. When he comes to know of your affair... What is the matter Meena? - l want to tell Rajesh everything. l have already told you it won't be right. How long can l cheat him? He has told me everything. The day he comes to know, he won't be convinced of our innocence. You are the only hope in his life! Don't disappoint him. l'm totally confused. What should l do? Forget about us completely! lt is your duty to keep Rajesh happy. This is new life. Do as l say. lt's not right for you to stay here. l didn't expect this out of you! - Please don't misunderstand. Then, what is the fact? - l can't tell you that... What excuse will you give Raja Sahab? Why don't you answer? Remember that once a women does something bad it stays with her. l have heard everything. Tell me Aarti... l shall tell you... l know it all! Don't worry Aarti. We'll get you married to Shekhar. You're lying! She deserves death if she is guilty. Are the wedding invitations ready? - l'll get them by evening. Yes Sir... - Come here... Keep this in the cupboard. ls Meena ready? She is talking with her father. - Girdharilal has come? Did you go to Shekhar's room at night? - Yes... What for? - l cannot tell you that You betrayed the man who honored you! And Shekhar claims to be his friend! lf l get chance l'll kill him too! - Father... Don't ever call me Father. This is impossible. They can't betray me! You are betraying yourself!
