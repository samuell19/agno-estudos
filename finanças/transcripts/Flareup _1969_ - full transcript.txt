[STARTS MOTOR] [♪♪] There's a table. I hope Nikki doesn't make us late to rehearsals. I think you're just worried about that new guitar player. Afraid he'll get restless. Well, I'm the only girl he's dated three times in a row. I'll just have, um, iced tea right now. There's one other person coming. Mm. That's fine for me too, thanks. MAN: Nikki? Don't make such a face. I just want a chance to talk to you for a minute. We've talked a hundred times, Alan. It's over! Because a judge said so? Look, I'll admit I made mistakes, but that doesn't cancel out all the good things. In the beginning, remember? We'll go back to San Francisco. You loved it there. That's where we blew it. You dancing in that club and getting your mind poisoned by those girls. Especially that Michele. Alan, we left San Francisco because you blamed it on your bad luck. We left Reno for the same reason. Now you're blaming it on Las Vegas. Maybe it's me. You? You're the only thing I ever loved! I'm sorry, Alan. [WOMEN CHATTING] Hi.Hi. It's about time! Robaire was in a creative mood. Oh. What are you having?A salad. I'm having Eggs Benedict. Are we still going shopping? Yes, I think we still have time. Well, do you think we have time? Um-hm. Nikki. Come with me now! Excuse me. Alan, please! ALAN: Nikki! [♪♪] [WOMAN SCREAMING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [GUNSHOT] [BULLET RICOCHETS] [ALARM RINGING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Oh, my God! Get a doctor! Please, somebody, get a doctor! You see Alan... never let up on Nikki, not once, since the divorce. He was pretty rough on Iris and I too. We were her witnesses. So he blamed the two of you for the divorce? Yeah. Well, he blamed everyone but himself. I just never thought he'd go this far. She's still in surgery? Oh, I see. Thank you. The doctors won't know anything for hours yet. May we go now, lieutenant? Uh, just as soon as you've signed your statements. What've you got, Franklin? Alan Leroy Morris, D.O.B. three-24-45, Oakland, California. Most recent occupation assistant manager at the Electric Club. Did you check it out? He hasn't worked there in a week. Ah. Two falls: possession of narcotics, one dismissed, one probation to a plead of guilty. Two arrests, suspicion of assault against his wife. We never did know who he blamed that one on. If you'll please sign these. Alright, I want copies of these plastered all over Las Vegas. Every hotel, bar, the works. I'll get it to Communications right away. Oh, just a minute! If you need us, we'll be in the hospital. Wait a minute. Lloyd can't spare two girls from the show and you've got the specialty. Yeah, big deal. It's only fair to him. Okay. Well, I'll meet you over there soon as I can. Just a moment, please. I want Bryan assigned to Iris. I want her to go the hospital and stay with her at all times. I'll assign Medford to Michele. Now, wait just a second. What's all this about? Morris tried to kill all three of you. He's right, Michele. I'll see you at the hospital. That's all I need is someone following me all around. Look, I know all you're trying to do is help, but I keep thinking of Nikki. She had a restraining order, and a lot of good that did her! Are you refusing police protection? If you really want to help me just find Alan! I want Medford assigned to that club where those girls dance. Right. [SIREN WAILING AND HORN HONKING] [BRAKES SQUEAL] [♪♪] [SLOW PSYCHEDELIC MUSIC PLAYING] Honey, don't you worry. Nikki'll be alright. I feel it. Should I phone the hospital again? No! Just leave me alone. [MICHELE CRYING] I'm sorry. I phoned Iris a little while ago. She said... she'd let me know if there's any change. She'll be alright. I feel it. That screwball. To do that to Nikki. She'll be alright. Oh, Jackie, turn the record over. [KNOCKING] MAN: Michele, can I see you for a moment? Yeah. Come on in, Lloyd. Oh, damn! Are you sure you feel well enough to work? Yeah, yeah. I feel fine. Might even make me feel better to get my mind off it for a little while. I'll phone the hospital again while you're on. Yeah. Okay.

Each and every one of them is looking for a husband, so... If any of you husbands are looking-- [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] --there'll be another show right away. So drink a few rounds, folks. It will be a blast. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDS] Jackie? Jackie, are you looking for the tall, blond guy? We're going to a party. He was my date. I know. I broke the date. Listen! Just because you're my boss doesn't mean you can break dates for me. That isn't--He's bad news, Jackie. Take my word for it. [SIGHS] Razor blade time of night, huh? Yeah. I've had it! Lloyd, he bugs me. He really bugs me! You know what he did? He broke my date with Tony, that good looking blond I was taking to Billy's party! Who does he think he is, my father or something? I mean, if I can't go out with whomsoever I please, I might as well be married or something! Honestly, I'm speechless! That'll be the day. Hey, why don't you come to the party? It'd do you good.Oh, not me. Not tonight. Oh, come on. It'll be a blast! You know who's gonna be there? Matteo Albrin. Who? The actor, Matteo Albrin. You mean you never heard of him? Shall we all face the East and bow three times? Thanks a lot, Jackie, but I don't know, parties are kinds like pot. When you're up, they're fine, but when you're down, they're nothing. Besides, I was going to the hospital just now. Oh, well, if you see Nikki, be sure and give her my love. And tell her that everything's gonna be alright. Okay. You're all tensed up.Yeah. Why don't you meet me later for a drink? I could help you freak out on this whole thing. Hey, listen, you've got the wrong girl. Easy, easy. Listen, leave me alone! That makes you right and me wrong, huh? It's not a question of right or wrong. It's just a question of what appeals to me and what doesn't. [SIGHS] Okay. That's that then. [QUIETLY] Are you alright? Nikki's gone! [CRYING] She just died. They brought her down from recovery. And a little while ago she starts hemorrhaging. Shh. It's okay. Come on, let's go. The car's over there. I'll take you home. No, thanks. I've got my own car. You shouldn't be by yourself. Now, come home with me. I just want to be alone right now. [STARTS ENGINE] [TIRES SQUEAL] Oh! [IRIS SCREAMS][THUD] [SCREAMS] [TIRES SQUEAL] [PANTING] [SOBBING] No. Please, please! Miss! You've gotta wait. No! But the police are gonna want to talk to you. You are a witness, miss! [SCREAMING] Get out of my way! [♪♪] [SIREN WAILING] I heard on the radio that cop died. "That cop" was 28 years old. His second child was born last week and he was one of the best men in the department. I'm sorry. Yeah, me too. Did you find Michele? Not a trace. What the hell's she trying to do? Get herself killed? [SIGHS] I checked with the other girls like you asked me to. They couldn't come up with a thing. No boyfriend's place? No, there's no special guy. At least not like that. What about relatives? Well, the kid's a real loner. Nikki. Iris. And if he catches up with Michele... We've got the whole town covered like a blanket. Is there anything you can come up with on the guy? [SCOFFS] You've got it all. You know, I try to keep the girls straight about these foul balls. And I had that one pegged. But Nikki was married to him. That stopped me cold. I wish I'd opened my big mouth. It's not your fault. I know you take pretty good care of your girls. I didn't do such a great job this time. You didn't make this world, either. You know, it might pay off for us. You're the one person Michele might get in touch with. I hope you're right. Find that guy. [SCOFFS] [QUIETLY] Yeah. [♪♪] Operator? Uh, yes. I'd like to make a person-to-person call. Do you want me to line up a replacement for the show? At least for the weekend? I guess maybe you'd better. [PHONE RINGING] Who can you get?Hello. Well, there's always Marie Chang. Yeah, please. If you can stand the boa constrictor. Oh, thanks a lot. Lloyd. It's long distance, Los Angeles. Yeah? Who's calling? Put her on. Michele, are you alright? Lloyd. Oh, don't worry about me. I'm fine. I-I'm sorry about running out on you that way. After what happened, I had to leave. You'd better point yourself right back here. The police are looking for you. They've been breathing down my neck. Did they pick up Alan yet? No. Then I'm not coming back. They can't make me! Now you listen to me. That's all the more reason why you need police protection. That hasn't stopped Alan yet. And if you're thinking about telling someone where I am, forget it! I may not be here for long. Anyway, I thought you were my friend. Now don't blow your cool. I'm on your side. You know that. How're you fixed for money? Oh, I'm alright. At least until I, uh, get a job. I'll need a few things. Lloyd, even forgetting about Alan, I can't go back there, not now. Okay, kid, whatever you say. I'll tell you what. There's a club in L.A., The Losers. Tell Jerry Benton I sent you. "Jerry Benton." "The Losers." Okay. Thanks. Don't thank me. I'm not so sure this whole thing is the right idea. [LINE CLICKS] She gonna stay in Los Angeles? You keep your mouth shut. You understand? Who, me? Ha, ha. Yeah, sure. [♪♪] [TIRES SQUEALING] Whoa! Whoa. Great landin', lady. Listen, some guys buy a car, they think they own the whole road. You got a bad tire here, lady. You got a spare? I'll have to fix that later. Is there a, uh, a Jerry Benton here? Yeah, inside. You gonna work here? Yeah, maybe. What does a girl have to do to get a job around here? Far as I know, just dance. Hey, you alright? Yeah, I'm just a little nervous, I guess. Want a sip of my Coke? Thanks. Tell ya what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna change that tire for you. What are you, one of the good guys? Fix my tire and give me a drink. [MICHELE CHUCKLES] Wish me luck. Hey, let you smell my, uh, good luck piece. Your what?[CHUCKLES] What? What is it? Go ahead, smell it .Wait. It won't hurt ya. It's rosewood. I got it down in Mexico. Hey, don't worry about it. You're gonna make it. Down. That's good. This one a little bit more. Yes? Uh, is Jerry Benton around? I'm Jerri Benton. Oh. You're a woman! Thanks for noticing. Are you Michele? Yes. Come on in. Lloyd phoned. He told me about you. Mm. It's okay. Oh, I go back a long way with Lloyd. You know he was the greatest straight man in burlesque? Ah. Well, he said you might need a dancer. You do a specialty at his club, don't you? Uh-huh. Strobe lights. Psychedelic, the usual. I can use that. Good. Well, would you like me to audition? Lloyd says you're great. And besides, if you had two left feet, I'd hire you if he asked me to. Oh, is that the way it is with you two? Us? We're too tired for romance. [CHUCKLES] Well, uh, why don't you drop around tonight and catch the show and you can set up your routine for tomorrow night. Right. Good, thanks. Okay, Harry, let's get this one. Fred! Did you...? You uptight, Sailor? Hey, Alan. Oh, hey. Every cop in town's after you, man. Yeah, but you won't yell "cop" because that'd blow your fix from Freddy. Hey, Alan, please get the hell away from me, huh? Where's Michele?How would I know? Because you know everything that happens in this joint. Please go away. Look, I killed three people, so what's a faggot junkie? Tell me where she is! She... Oh, she's in Los Angeles.

Thirty-two years married, and she still waits up for me. That's very nice. Are you a married man? I was. [SIGHS] Two years ago this June, it should have been. It didn't work out. Well, it started off fine. [SIGHS] I made mistakes. Well, everybody makes mistakes. But we could've been happy. But you know what breaks up marriages: other people. You, uh, mean her folks? I mean everybody! Tellin' her crazy things about me and making her believe 'em. I tried to be reasonable, tried not to get bitter. Perhaps it's not too late to try again. Why don't you, uh, make an effort to appease her and, uh... try--She's dead. Just like me. They killed both of us, the bastards! They wouldn't let us live. Why are you stopping? Oh, I-I just remembered I promised to stop at my daughter's, pick up something. You can get a lift here. Good luck to ya. Mr. Willows, you're lyin' to me.

And Nikki. Michele, look it, listen to me, will you? And the, and the bell was ringing. Michele. And Alan was there. He's always there. He's always there. [WHISPERING] He's always there. After what you told me last night, I-I knew this is no time for you to be alone. You know what I want you to do? Grab your clothes. Get out of that lousy, depressing hotel room, and, uh-- [SIGHS] --come on over here. Oh, Joe, you don't understand. I gotta, I gotta solve this thing by myself. It's, it's my problem. I don't want to drag you into it. Hey, will you let me help you? I'd like to help. What are you trying to prove? You can't help. I don't know. I wish I knew the answers. Will you come over? No, I can't. [SCOFFS] Alright. I've been, uh, sittin' around here thinkin' about last night. Uh-huh. It's good, Michele, you know? Was it, Joe? [SOBBING] Morning, George.Morning. What have you got? The body was found there by the caretaker about an hour ago. Shot once in the back of the head. Any identification? Whoever shot him took it all. Figures. Except for this signet ring. Initials J.W. on it. Just one thing, lieutenant. There was a 150 left in cash. Which doesn't figure. That kills the robbery motive. Ah. What about markings on the clothing? The suit was from the local department store. I picked up this shell casing. A nine millimeter. I think shot from a P38. What about the bullet?Still in the victim. You know, I was just thinking, that man Morris, who shot his wife, he used a P38. Look, as soon as the coroner can give you that slug, have the Firearms Application check it out. And see how that shell casing compares with the one we found at the Morris shooting. Strange.What? Kill a man, but don't rob him. Ah, yeah. [STARTS ENGINE] [GEORGE STARTS ENGINE] [TIRES SQUEAL] [CHATTER AND CHEERS ON TELEVISION] [DOORBELL RINGING] Alright! So I changed my mind. Come on in. Oh. Thanks. I'll hang these up for you. Okay.

[LAUGHS] Aren't you a little big for toys? [BOTH LAUGHING] For your information, that's no toy. That thing is, uh, gonna fly. Mm-mm. In the air? Like a bird. Around in circles, that is.[CHUCKLES] It's gonna fly. Do you wanna see how it works? Yeah, I'd love to. This is, uh, the igniter. Would you hold this little nozzle for me-- --because, uh, to, just to put the gas in this one point? Right there. [GIGGLES] It works. [CHUCKLING] [ENGINE STARTS][MICHELE SCREAMS] [LAUGHING] What about your neighbors? [MOTOR SILENCES] Yeah, they get mad at me sometimes. I wonder why. [LAUGHS] Sometimes at night, you know, I get up on top of the roof. Oh, boy, I'd fly that thing around. You should hear the neighbors then. [LAUGHS] You want cream and sugar? Black's fine. Like I said, you just do whatever you want, you know? Make yourself at home. Thanks. I like your place, Joe. Thank you. [CHEERING ON TV] MICHELE: What, are you hung up on bullfights? JOE: Mm-mm. No. I used to be when I was in high school. Now, why would anyone want to be a bullfighter? Money. Yeah. I once, uh, read a quote. It said that, "Hunger wounds worse than the kill." [LAUGHS] Uh, could we just turn off the set before--? I'd like not-- I don't really want to see the kill. These are nice. You like photography, huh? Yeah. I kind of fool around with it. Hey. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] Oh, come on, now. [LAUGHS] Go-- Stop.Hey, you got a pretty face. No, please. Oh, this here, this is my old man right here. The one in the middle.This one. Yeah. And this is my uncle, my other uncle, his brothers and my grandmother, who's 96 years old, lives in Oregon and is still kicking around. And her sister. Her sister's a beauty, isn't she? Yeah-- [LAUGHS] God, they're dressed funny. Emiliano Zapata. Yeah. The revolutionist. He's a pretty strong-looking guy, isn't he? Yes, he is. Kind of reminds me of my father a little. Oh, yeah? Mm-hm. Just a bit around the eyes. Hey, you want, uh-- You want some music? Yes. Lovely. [SOFT JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] Go ahead, sit down. Okay. Whew! What about your old man? Oh, not much, really. My mother kicked him out of the house. I was only 8 years old when he left. My mother just kept chipping away at him. He never got a break. Can't blame him much. Sometimes I think maybe he's tied up with what I've been looking for. Well, we're all looking for something, aren't we? Yeah. I hope you're going to like it here. You know what you ought to do? Just-- Just take your mind off everything, if you can. I'm sorry. I guess I've been kind of a drag. Hey. Now you see? There you go again. You're not a drag. You like the beach? Yes, I do. I love it. We got fantastic beaches around here. I got a day off tomorrow. We'll go, alright? Great. Well, I've got my car. Now, that reminds me. You were gonna tell me about your car. [LAUGHS] A friend of mine, he got in a jam. That's all. [LAUGHS] No. Now, why-- You know, you talk too much. Mm! Mm! [BOTH LAUGHING] Now, this slug was taken from the Morris woman. And this one came from the Willows body. Take a look, lieutenant. Now as you can see, the general characteristics and the fine striations match up. There's no doubt that they came from the same gun. The same goes for the shell casings. The break we needed. Communications. This is Manion speaking. I want an APB. Investigation by the Clark County Sheriff's Department confirms the fact that bullets which killed Nikki Morris came from the same gun that killed victim now identified by this department as Arthur Willows. Alan Morris is now believed in possession of a 1969 black over white Plymouth sedan, Nevada license C-5-8-6-8-5. Subject is armed and extremely dangerous. Right. Oh! Come on.

[LAUGHING] I think we got something going. Yeah, something good. Oh, it's funny. I guess I never really cared about anyone up until now. With me it was always just one of those things, you know? Yeah. It kind of scares me a little. Before, I could always stay or go. It didn't matter much one way or the other. It sure matters to me what you do. Does it, Joe? Mmm. It's lonely having nobody. Could I ask you a question, Joe? Sure. If I did decide to leave... would you want to go with me? I mean, just pick up and leave everything behind. You mean just cut out? Yeah. Like, uh, right now?

And I know that nice, handsome, young pusher, Fred. Keeps you feeling no pain. I can score for myself. I talk to the right people, and in a matter of weeks you're in a place with wire screens on the windows. Is that what you want, Sailor? Alright, okay. The call was from Michele. He was waiting for me that night. He hurt me bad. He would have killed me. Lieutenant, Sailor remembered some answers. Hey, where are you going? Well, I thought I'd get some gas. We're almost out.

Look, I'll admit I'm not an asset to society, but you made me kill the only thing I ever loved, you know? So let's make a deal, you and me. I'll get rid of the three of us. You, me and your boyfriend. I sort of planned it that way anyhow, you know? Michele? [♪♪] [TIRES SCREECH] Hey! Hey, lady! [♪♪] [TIRES SCREECH][CAR HORN HONKS] [TIRES SCREECH] [WHIMPERS] [EXOTIC BIRD SQUAWKING] [CHAINS RATTLING] [LION GROWLING] [LION GROWLING CONTINUOUS] [EXOTIC BIRD SQUAWKING] [MONKEY GIBBERING] [PANTING] [GASPS] [SCREAMS] [♪♪] [GRUNTS] [PANTING] What are you doing out here?[GASPS] [GASPS] Joe. Oh... I'm right here, I'm right here. Oh, my God. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Is... Where is this? This is an emergency hospital. I'm Dr. Connors. Oh, wow. He was after me in the park. We know, Michele. You told us. I don't remember that. How did you get here? On a plane. Did you get Alan?We will. We've covered every airport, bus terminal, railroad station. There are roadblocks on all main arteries, as well as the radio and television coverage. This is Lieutenant Harrison of Los Angeles Homicide, Michele. Now, he's stationed a patrolman just outside your door for your safety. Doctor, may I have a talk with her now? Yes, but please be brief. Could I... Could I just talk with Joe a minute, please? Okay, but just for a minute. [DOOR CLOSES] The guy at the gas station told me about the phone call. And I waited and waited for you to show up at work. I thought someone pulled a rug out from under me. [SIGHS] Joe, um... remember, um... what you promised me at the beach? You mean about cutting out? Yeah. I just thought that maybe we'd go to Mexico. There are beaches there, and bullfights. Shh. No, really, I... We could go tomorrow. We could just, uh, get in the car and split just the two of us. How does that sound?Sure. Sounds great. It should be great. Joe... do you really mean it? Yeah. [DOOR OPENS] Mr. Brodnek? Tomorrow. [DOOR CLOSES] Doctor, how soon do you think I can take Michele back to Las Vegas? Possibly by this afternoon. Oh, I'm not going back to Las Vegas. I'm sorry, Michele, but it's gotta be total police custody for you until we've got Alan Morris locked up. I am not going back to Las Vegas. In that case, you'll be given police protection here until you can be extradited as a material witness. Doctor, please, tell them to get out of here. Gentlemen, please. Everything's gonna be alright. Just trust us. I want you to try and get yourself some sleep. [DOOR CLOSES] Thanks a lot. Keep the change. [SIGHS] [GASPS AND SCREAMS]Not a sound. You know, this is even better than I expected. I was waiting here for Joe. [GASPS] What do you...? What do you want with Joe? I'm gonna kill him, just like you killed Nikki. You really are sick, aren't you? They ought to lock you up someplace. Yeah, I'm touched by your concern. No! No! [WHIMPERS] Yeah, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking you'll get somebody up here. But I can kill you before they even get here, and then wait for Joe, huh? Officer... [CALCULATOR GRINDING]BARTENDER: Two seventy-five. Jerri, I'm gonna split. You going back to the hospital now, Joe? No, no, they want her to get some rest. Go home. You look beat. Jack can help me close up. Yeah, I'll see you. Five fifty-five. [SNIFFS] I could use a drink of water. Let's go to the kitchen. [GRUNTS] You were gonna stick that right in me, weren't you? [CRYING] Mind if I get my water now? [PANTING] How much longer? How much longer are you gonna keep it up? 2:15 now. As long as it takes him to get here. Why don't you just get it over with? That wouldn't be a bit of fun, now, would it? Now unless you got some more bright ideas, why don't you sit down? Relax. [SIGHS] You know, you shouldn't hate me. Because after all, I'm not responsible. I'm sick. I need help. You said so yourself. Yeah, well, I'll tell them that, Alan? I'll tell them it's not your fault. [SIGHS] That's a nice try. Stall. But you can't save Joe from me any more than I could save Nikki from you. Save Nikki from me? Alan, you killed Nikki. Get it? Yeah, I killed her. I killed her because of your lies. Your lies. And you know something? You shouldn't be telling lies, not now, not in the last few minutes of your life. [SOBBING] We're gonna wait for Joe. And I'm gonna kill Joe while you watch. And then I'm gonna kill you. Los Angeles Police Department. Los Angeles Police Department. Detective Newcomb. What'd we do wrong? I'm looking for Michele. She's in the hospital. Not anymore. She slipped out a window. Oh, no. That poor girl. NEWCOMB: We were alerted for someone getting in to the hospital, not out. You have any idea where she might be? She's at a hotel. I have her address in the office. Don't, don't. Don't bother. She checked out of there day before yesterday. What about the fellow who came to the hospital? Joe. Joe. He left here a little while ago. Have any idea where I can reach him? Well, I have his phone number in the office. I'll get it. "Fiesta Bravo." [SCOFFS] Hung up on bullfights. You gotta be some kind of a freak to like to watch an animal die. Or does it, uh... Does it make him a better lover? [LAUGHS] It didn't help you much, did it? What's that supposed to mean? You could kill a man in cold blood, but you can't even make it with your wife. That's what it means. She couldn't stand the sight of you! It's a lie, it's a lie. No. Nikki would never tell you that. Not Nikki. [GASPS][PHONE RINGS] I'll try Tora. Maybe she's heard from her. [PHONE RINGING] Hello?JERRI [OVER PHONE]: This is Jerri. Is Michele with you?Michele? She disappeared from the hospital. Oh, my God. The police checked out her hotel. She left there. TORA: Well, she moved over to Joe's. Do you know where he lives? She gave me the address. Wait just a minute. I wrote it down. What? What? It's party time. Surprise party time. DISPATCHER: Description of subject remains as before. Address of Joseph Brodnek is 320 Ardmore Street, Apartment 104. Code Three. [ENGINE STARTS] [SIREN WAILS] [TIRES SCREECH] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] You'll be right here. Just like that. [♪♪] [GRUNTS] [SCREAMING] Oh, my God, Michele. No! [SIRENS WAILING] Ten, 20, 25. A hundred and twenty-five dollars. Oh, I figured a hundred.It's my adding machine. Are you gonna fight it for 25 bucks? Not me. I hate to see you go, Michele. You've always got a job here. Well, thanks. I'll remember that. Good luck. I'll need it. Hi, honey. Listen, we gotta go downtown. We gotta get some kind of a green card. But I called them this morning and they said we don't need a passport just to get to Mexico City, but we do need some other kind of a little card. Then we have to go by and get some shots. And, uh, then... Michele. Listen, what are you doing? Suppose I said I don't want to go? Well, you can't do that. Not after all our plans and everything. We made those plans when Alan was alive. Well, what's that got to do with anything? I mean, how does that change anything? What do you mean? We stay here now. What's so important about here? What the hell is so important about going down to Mexico? Michele, you wanna know what's important? You and I, that's what's important. I've heard that one before. Look, I never stayed anyplace in my life. I never kept house. I never had a bank account. Or a husband. Or a kid. How's that grab you? Michele, we got something going now, so why do you want to run away from it? I mean, what do you got? Well, I've always got my wheels, and I can go anyplace, any time. That's how I like it. [CHUCKLES] You got your wheels. Mm, there she goes. Bombshell, see you in a year, maybe two. What the hell is that? You just gonna keep running? I don't belong to anybody. I want you to belong to somebody. Me. Come here. You sure are something, I'll tell you. Joe, why can't you understand? I don't want to be tied down. I need you. We could have a ball together in Mexico City. We could have a life right here. You just make it tough. Either we go or we don't go. I'm not going. I'm not going. Take care of yourself, huh?
