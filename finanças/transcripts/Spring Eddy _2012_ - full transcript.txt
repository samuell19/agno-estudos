Yeah. You're welcome. Heading into town. You wouldn't happen to need a- A ride? Yeah, I do. [engine rumbles] [engine stops] [footsteps] You okay? I don't mean to interrupt, but I saw your car and I thought you might have had some trouble. Oh, no, no, no, don't get down, you're doing fine. I don't know about that. We've been in the same position for half an hour. Oh, they're very, very smart. They'll see just how much they can get away with. Especially if they don't know you. Yeah. The trick is to show them who's boss. Okay? Lift her head up. Good, good, good. Now, back straight. Now, while squeezing with your legs, give her just a slight nudge. Okay, no, try again. No, squeeze! Can you give us just a moment? Okay. [whisper inaudible] [horse clopping] C'mon. [clopping] Whoa! Whoa, whoa. Very nice! [both laugh] Yeah. Thanks. Well, I guess I owed you for last night. Well then, we're even. Except for what you did to my car. Out. [laughs] She don't look like much but she'll get you from A to B. I wouldn't try C, though. [Jeannie] You did what? Shh! What was I supposed to do? The only reason I'm still alive is he thinks I have the money. So this guy followed you all the way out here? Well, technically, he followed you. So what does this mean? It means I've got to get out of here... tonight. Tonight? How are you gonna get out of here tonight? You don't even have bail set. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no! Absolutely not, no way! [clanging] Ma'am? [engine revs] [crickets and birds chirping] [splash] [crickets and birds chirping] [splash] I wouldn't get much closer to that edge. Rocks can be kind of tricky. You know, you might want to give a person a little warning before you sneak up on them like that. Yeah, well, I thought that's what I just did. What are you doing here? You followed me. Oh, I did not. It just so happens I come out here all the time. It's peaceful. I can think. Yeah, I guess it is kind of peaceful. So how's your friend doing? My friend? Yeah, back in town, at Sam's. How do you know about him? Big news, small town. Thinking of getting him out? What's that supposed to mean? Nothing, I just figured that's why you're down here. What'd you think I meant? Nothing. What'd you think I thought you meant? I have no idea what you just said. Okay, then. Right. [crickets and birds chirping] You know him? Not really. Is he going somewhere? Yeah, he's heading over to that spot. Gonna wait a while. When she doesn't show, he'll- he'll head on back. Well, I'm-a head on back, so you- just be careful out here. Wait a second. You can't do that. Do what? Uh, follow me. I- for- I didn't follow you! And then start going on about some old guy waiting in a boat for someone who never shows up and then just walk away? -Look, I- -Huh? I wasn't going on about anything. You- you're the one that asked me! It's never your fault, is it? What are you talking about, fault? I- alright, you really know how to get on people's last nerves, don't you? Are you gonna tell me? Yeah, if you can keep your trap shut for five seconds. Well, first of all, I'm only telling you what I've been told. I make no claim to its accuracy. Oh, those are the best kind. Sorry, continue. Alright. Well, at one time, most all of this country was owned by a handful of wealthy ranchers. Some cattle, mostly oil, but a lot of money either way. Well, there was this one rancher in particular that had a beautiful daughter, and he caught wind that his little girl had gone sweet on some old boy from across the river. Him? Yeah. Well, that didn't set too well with him, so he told her she wasn't to see him no more, and that didn't go so well either because they'd just sneak off and meet right down there. And that went on for some time, until one of his ranch hands spotted them and went straight back to the old man. Well, he figured, the only way to fix this situation was to take her as far away from this place as possible. So he decided to ship her off to boarding school up north. Well, one of the house cooks overhears this and tells the girl. It was at this point that they realize the only way they can be together was if they got hitched, you know. So on the evening before she was to be packed off, they'd meet up right there at that spot, cross over, and make it official before her old man even knew she was missing. Well? She never showed. What happened? Nobody knows for sure. Poppa could have gotten wind, cold feet. Nobody knows. Why would he keep doing this? I guess he just figures she'll show up one day. Maybe she will. Maybe he's just everyday crazy. It'll be getting dark soon. What do you think? About what? About him holding onto something that happened a long time ago? I'll go with crazy.
