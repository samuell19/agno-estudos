(subdued music) (moves to dramatic music) (phone ringing) - hello. - Hi, elaine, sorry to bother you. This is allison byrne from the new york dance company. - Oh hi, it's, it's nice to hear from you. - I'm checking to see if you're auditioning. We were sad to miss you last year. - Uh, yes me too. Luckily, I healed very fast so I will definitely be there. - That's great to hear. I'm phoning to let you know that you're on our radar and if things go well here, you can be expecting an offer. - Um, yes, thank you. I will be dancing my very best. - I have no doubt about that. Have a good night. - You too, bye. (tv playing softly) - [damon] ah! (elaine shrieking) - damon, I will literally kill you. - Uh, no, I would have literally killed you. - Oh my god. - You need to stop leaving your door unlocked. You're practically inviting creeps to barge in. - Creeps like you. - Creeps like me. So what is this I hear about you dancing your best? Not for another boy, I hope. - Oh, a scout called me. - No! - Yeah! (laughing) I don't know, my brain is not really functioning right now. I'm very excited. Ah, it's like everything I've ever wanted, I, I cannot believe that this is happening. - Yeah, you're gonna be absolutely amazing. They're gonna wish they hired you three years ago. - If the pressure doesn't eat me alive. - You are more than ready, lainy. - I started working on that shirt. I am now the master of scissors. - Let me see. - Okay, do still need to figure out a pair of leggings though? (gentle music) - you look so beautiful. - The children. - They're asleep. - They could wake up. (car door slamming shut) okay, you need to go. Go go go go go. - I know, I know, I know. - Take this. - See you, lainy. - Bye. - [damon] bye. - Will you take elaine home tonight? - Yeah, my pleasure. - Thank you. - Hey. - [silvia] hey. - How was dinner? - It was good, how were the girls? - Perfect as always. - Oh good, did you get lily to eat her dinner? - Yes, it wasn't a problem. - Good. All right, I'm exhausted so I'm gonna go check on the girls and adrian will take you home. Goodnight. - Night. - Goodnight. Congratulations, you've passed the test. You're officially allowed to raise children of your own now. No time like the present to fulfill destiny. - I think I'll wait a few years. (laughing) - I better get you home, come on. - Are you sure? I can just walk. - It's late, I should really take you. (ominous symphonic music) - your camera bag? You really don't go anywhere without that thing, do you? - Well, you never know when you might see something worth capturing. - I was actually thinking about hiring a photographer for the audition, but, um, you people charge an arm and a leg. - [adrian] I'd be happy to photograph you and, uh, daryl? - Damon. (elaine chuckling) - you guys still together? - Longer than you and silvia. - Touche. Did you know it's our one year coming up? - [elaine] no. - Look at these fantastic cufflinks. I'm still trying to figure out what to get her. - Beautiful. - What's damon done? - Um, you know little things to show he cares. Foot rubs, breakfast in bed. We've never really had the money for anything extravagant. - Well, why don't I do something extravagant for you. Just a little something extra to say thank you for all your hard work. - Thank you. - Of course. - Hey, miss chan, sorry I'm late again. - Oh, I know you're good for it. - Thanks. - Tell your boyfriend to close the door. He left it open all day. - Damon doesn't have the key to my apartment. - See you next month!

If you have the best patty cake, you are great. - Hey, sorry I'm late. - No worries, I'm working from home today. - And uh, what is it you psychologists work on again? - Psychiatrist, actually. I'm currently working on a study of family roles. - Oh. - Carrying on my mother's work. - Oh wow, she must be so proud. - We were never close. Ironically, she was studying the roles of children in the family. I'm studying women. Specifically, what makes a mother ideal. - Oh, silvia's almost too good be true for a study like that. - I'm sure any man would say the same for you. (elaine chuckling) - [mackenzie and lily] elaine, come play! Come play, come on, please. - Okay, all right. - You've got your work cut out for you. - So do you. (chuckling) come on, come here.

Um, all right, well, I'll see you tomorrow. - Um, I'll call you. (upbeat latin music) - I have an idea. - I'm listening. - You know that lift?

I'm not gonna let you fall. And when you got injured, it was a freak accident. You're safe. - Yeah. I guess I'm just distracted. You know, babysitting blues. - Wha, what is it, lainy? - It's stupid. Like weird stupid. - Come on, I won't think it's stupid. I pinky swear. - I don't know, I was babysitting today and we were by the pool. I was wearing the same bathing suit I always wear. And I don't know, silvia just freaked out at me. She told me not to wear my bathing suit around adrian like I'm trying to seduce him or something. - That is weird, was he in the pool with you or? - No, he was inside working. - Maybe she's just insecure. Didn't you tell me that silvia was in one toxic relationship after the next before she met adrian? Maybe she's just scared of losing him. - Maybe, I don't know. Right now it just kind of feels like I don't have a job tomorrow. - You still have your job. Silvia loves you. Okay? - Say good night to peggy. - Night peggy. Please, don't go to bed. (silvia chuckling) night momma. - Night lily-pad. - We need to talk. Why would you say that to elaine? You embarrassed us both. - [silvia] oh, I'm sorry. - I was working. How many times do I have to tell you this is my work? I study people, women especially. - You were filming her! The girls and I won't be staying here tonight. - Is that what you think? - Adrian, I love that you're so fascinated with studying women, but there is a line as to what's appropriate and you continue to cross it. (couple grunting) (dramatic music) adrian please, please just let me leave. Please just let me leave, please. - Subservience, the single most important trait of a woman. (laughing) and to think you had so much potential. You're being anxious and irrational again. It's time to take your medication. - I already took it. - Being argumentative is a masculine trait brought on by high levels of testosterone. Trust me, silvia. This is going to level you out. (silvia sobbing) (portentous music) - stop. (ominous music) - silvia? Silvia? I'm here. (girls chattering in the distance) - [mackenzie and lily] elaine! - Hello! Where's your mom? - We don't know. - She getting changed? - No, she hasn't come out all morning. - How about adrian, is he home? - Nope, he left. It's their anniversary. - Oh. - He's getting a love gift. (chuckling) (elaine laughing) - okay, all right, I'm gonna go check on your mom. She would not like this mess. - [mackenzie] she made the mess. No you... I'll be back. - She, you know she made it. She made the mess. - [mackenzie] you made it. - [lily] no you, you made it. - Silvia? Silvia? Silvia? The girls are making a mess downstairs. Um, I'll clean it. You feeling okay? Silvia? (dissonant music) - [mackenzie and lily] elaine! - D-d-d-don't come in here. - [911 operator] 911, what's your emergency? - Uh please, please send help, please. (police chattering over the radio) (somber music) - are you elaine davidson? - Yes. - I'm detective munro. Mind going over your statement with me? - Um, sure. I, I got here at 7:00 a.M, um, that's when silvia asked me to babysit. I let myself in. - Is it normal for no one to answer? - Sure, I mean I usually see her at some point, um. - So she texted you? - Yeah, uh, around midnight was when I got the message. And she asked if the kids and her could stay over at my place. - Is that normal? - No, I mean, it was kind of weird. I mean, we're co-workers. And you know then a couple minutes later she texted me again saying nevermind, the text was meant for her mom. - [detective] continue. - I went to go check on her. It was strange for the girls to be unattended. - Did anything look out of place when you walked in, or? - No, not really. - Where is she? What's going on? What's happening? - Are you adrian cartwright? - Yes. - Mind coming with me. - It's okay. Of course, yeah. - I got them. - Thank you. - Mind telling me where you were this morning? - Yeah, I was in a session with a client. I'm a psychiatrist. Today was our anniversary. - I'm sorry to hear that. Follow me. Are there security cameras in your home? - Nanny-cams. - In your bedroom? - No, that was not necessary. - Well, I'll need you to turn over anything you have from last night. Under normal circumstances, we would assume foul play. But there was absolutely no sign of struggle or forced ingestion. - Excuse me? - Were you aware that your wife was on antidepressants? - Yes, she was, she was seeing an associate of mine for treatment. - All evidence points to suicide. (adrian sobbing) I'm very sorry for your loss. - Sir, we're going to have to, uh, have you, uh, please come down to the station for questioning. Sir. Not now, take your time. (dissonant music) (menacing music) - [damon] okay, so just please just don't worry about it. I know it's all on your mind right now but you just gotta, you gotta stay focused.

Mm-mm. - Hey, adrian. - Hi, elaine, I hope I'm not interrupting anything. - No, um, how are you holding up? - Not well to be honest. Silvia's mother and I are meeting up to discuss funeral arrangements. Could you come over? - Are you sure it's a good idea for the girls to have a babysitter right now. - Well, you're a part of the family. The girls already feel abandoned by their mother. If you were to disappear too, I'm sure it would just make it much harder. Though I do understand if you feel uncomfortable. - No, no of course not. I'll, I'll be there. - [adrian] are you at home? I could come collect you. - That's okay. Damon will give me a ride. - [adrian] excellent. - Great. Bye. - Everything okay? Girls okay? - Yeah, wants me to come over. - Don't you think it's a bit weird adrian's not with the girls right now? - What do you mean? - I don't know, his wife just died. I mean, he should be with his family. - I mean, he's only their stepdad. You know I've been with them since they were babies. They need me right now. Do you mind? - It's a good thing I love you. (inauspicious music) - [elaine] I'm fine, really just stressed. - Well, I'm happy to listen. Please. - You really don't have to worry. I mean, I've had a bit of a weird day, but I know that what you're going through is a heck of a lot worse. - Honestly, if you can take my mind off silvia, even for a moment, I'd be very thankful. Please, tell me what's going on. - I don't know, I, I guess I'm pretty stressed for this audition. I, I don't really know if I'm ready to dance again. - You know it's completely natural for a woman such as yourself to feel insecure after such a traumatic injury. What you need is the proper support. Now a doctor can heal your leg, but really it's your relationship with yourself and others that will heal your mind. How long ago did your injury happen? - Um, about this time last year. I was supposed to audition for the same company and I got injured rehearsing. - [adrian] ah, so you're stuck in a loop. - Um, what do you mean? - A year ago you were injured right before your chance of success. Your fear that history will repeat itself is self-sabotage. Your subconscious basically wants you to fail. - So what do I do to get out of the loop? - Well, there are a number of things that we could do. Have you considered a change in career? - I, I don't really know if I'm ready to talk about this yet. - It's fine, I'm sorry if I crossed the line. - [elaine] no. - [adrian] I'm only here to help. - I should get back to the children. - Elaine, men and women have inherent purposes. If dance isn't fulfilling you, don't forget to think about what does. The children, for instance, never fail to make you happy. - Yeah, you're definitely right about that. - I was very close with my babysitter growing up. Don't discount the importance of your role in their lives. - Thank you. (ill-boding music) - [boy] I can play baseball? - [mother] if you want to. - Thank you, mommy, thank you. No, mommy, no! - You need to learn that nothing in life is permanent. It will help you mature. - Oh hey, uh, hey dr. Cartwright. - Not now. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just really need some closure. I just wanted to ask you about the text, uh, silvia sent me the night before she died. - Will you excuse me? - Yeah, okay. The police were asking me and I'm a little confused. - Look if you, if you want to come over another day, I'd be happy to put your mind at ease. - Yeah, okay. (dramatic instrumental music) - [mother] you want it, take it. - What are you doing? - Oh I couldn't figure out how to change the input. It was stuck on dvd all night. (chuckling) - what did you watch? - A little nostalgic to my childhood. - Mm-hmm. I should probably get you home. - Yeah. Thanks for the ride. - Of course. Elaine, I, I was wondering if you had a chance to think about our conversation we had in my office. - I did. Um, you were right. I may be physically ready to dance again, but I don't know if I'll ever be mentally ready. - If you ever want to talk more about it. - I've got damon. He's a better listener than I give him credit for. - Elaine, I'm not one to judge, but sometimes the person we lean on most is actually the person that's standing in the way of our success. Believe it or not, I've actually got a bit of experience in that area, so I'm here if you need me. - Okay, I appreciate it. - Good night. - Night. - [boy] no, mommy, no! - You need to learn that nothing in life is permanent. It will help you mature. - I said no! - You want it, take it. - Ow, my hand! - Oh my gosh, what's going on? Did he burn himself? - [boy] I want to play baseball. (mumbling) - if he wanted it so badly, he would have taken it. - The essence of femininity is trifold. To be classified as a true woman, she must be subservient, interested in children, and fearful. To be classified as a true man, he must be in possession of a true woman. (sinister symphonic music) - hey, morning. - Thanks for giving me a ride. - Of course. So what happened? - I'm not a hundred percent sure. Damon said it looked like somebody slashed his back tires last night. - [adrian] that's too bad. You're lucky I was free to give you a ride. - [elaine] yes, thank you. I would have never made the physical for my audition, if I had to take the bus. - Is that what you wear to dancing? - Yeah, damon just bought me the leggings. - Huh. - What? - Oh, well, the leggings cover your scar completely. Covering your scar is sealing your pain. - I don't really think he thought that much into it. - Well, maybe not consciously, elaine. Really it's the subconscious that drives most of our actions. - Uh, you can take a left here. I'm actually gonna be a bit early so you can just drop me off at the cafe down the street. - [adrian] need some company? - [elaine] oh, that's all right. I have to work on some paperwork for the audition. - I uh, know it's uncomfortable, elaine. But I really would like to talk more on the subject of your injury when you're ready. - When I'm ready. (menacing music) (door slamming shut) - [damon] door open again. Will this girl ever learn? I'll text her right now. (adrian and damon grunting) (car horn honking) - damon? Damon? You in here? Damon, you have got to stop leaving my door open. Ms. Chan is gonna kill me if she... Oh my god, what happened? - Some dirt-bag broke in. - What? - Luckily, we didn't leave anything of value for him to take. - And, and he attacked you? We, okay we, we need to call the police and we- - what are the police gonna do? I mean, nothing was stolen. I didn't get a good look at the guy. We don't even have a security camera. I'm just so glad that you weren't there. - God, just seeing you like this shakes me up. So what are you doing here? - Uh, I got you something. - A necklace. - You okay? Hey, I can take it back if you- - no, no, no, I really like it, and the leggings. Thank you. I just, it's kind of a lot right now, you know it's... I'll, um, I'll get you a fresh icepack. (foreboding music) (foreboding music) sushi or pizza? - Sushi. - Mmm, yes, good choice. - Thank you. Ooh, what's this? - (sighing) this better not be another ticket. - Looks more like a wedding invitation, if you ask me. Last night was the best night of my life. Love sandra. - Seriously? - Yeah, okay, I'm gonna go. - No, elaine, don't go. How many times have I told she's an ex-dance partner. I wasn't even with her last night. I was home last night fixing my tire. - You really expect me to buy that? - Ask my roommate. - Yeah, I um, I actually just really cannot deal with this right now. So I'm just gonna. - Elaine. - I'll call you. - Who writes notes? - I haven't talked to damon in a week. I mean, we were planning our whole future together. Not just our relationship but our careers too and- - wow. He's really spinning a web of lies around you. You know some men can't help but put their pleasure before monogamy. Do you fear you can't make it as a dancer without him? - No. Well, maybe. I definitely can't nail the audition without him. - Why is this audition so important to you? - Well, I'm being scouted by this company. I've got the interview with the director coming up and then the audition, then it's just been my dream to dance for this company in new york ever since I was a little girl. I mean, I remember there were times I would go see them. And it was just- - I'm sorry, can I, can I stop you there? You're leaving. - Well, not if I don't perform. I'm sorry. I know that people usually pay for therapy and here I am just venting to you and I should be working for you. - Well, maybe we can cut a deal. I can give you some more work around the house and we can schedule some more sessions together. - Yeah, no, I'm happy to do anything you need. I can pick up laundry or grocery runs or- - actually, what I had in mind has more to do with my study. Would you mind if I filmed you? I can pay you very well. - Filmed me doing what? (subdued music) - [mackenzie and lily] one, two, three on elaine! - You found me. Why do you hide up here? - It's so high. - All right, let me see. Gandhi, can anyone spell it? Where is she? - [lily] um, here! - [elaine] in here? - [elaine and lily] ah, one, two, three on mackenzie! (girls laughing) - I got you girls. - I'm out of film. - How am I doing? - Perfect. - I'm starving. - Well, it is about lunchtime. - Who wants sandwiches? - [mackenzie and lily] me! - Do you mind making them? - Not at all. (doubtful music) - [adrian] please have a seat. - You know, I'm glad we could do this. My head's been all over the place since silvia's passing. - Is that what you wanted to talk about? - Look, man, when I first heard silvia killed herself, I didn't believe it. To be honest, I told the police I thought you had something to do with it. But when I saw the look on your face when you arrived, I thought I was wrong. - Well, if you thought you were wrong, what's the issue? - It's just the text message she sent me was really weird. I get the feeling it wasn't just a coincidence. Like she was asking me for help. - That text message was meant for her mother. - Well, if it was meant for her mother, then why did she send it to me? - Well, her mother's name is hannah, and hannah and hank are right next to each other alphabetically. Can I ask you a personal question? - After I've interrogated you, please. - Has someone close to you ever died? - Uh, yeah, my mother. - What happened? - She had a heart attack when I was a young boy. I didn't know what to do, and didn't remember to call an ambulance until it was too late. - That's awful. But, uh, I understand. - What do you mean? - Well, I don't think it's a stretch to say that you may still be trying to compensate for the death of your mother. And by investigating silvia's death as suspicious, you're able to transfer your guilt onto someone else, someone like me. - Er, I'm sorry I don't think that's related. - You wouldn't have realized, it's completely normal. (phone buzzing) do you mind if I get this? - Sure, of course. - Thanks. Hello? (computer beeping) - [hank] molly. Hannah huh? - Was there anything else you wanted to talk about? - No, I'm good. - [lily] eat your meat, darlin'. - Okay, girls, now remember no socks or shoes for at least half an hour, okay? - Okay. - You okay, lil? - She's just sad because adrian took pegasus away and mommy gave her pegasus. - He did? Well, why'd he do that? - He put her in his office, 'cause I was being bad. - Well, hey, maybe I can get her back for you? Yeah? Everybody, wait here and no socks. - [lily] okay. - And hey, thanks for chatting. Though, you know I still don't know how you continue to live in a house where someone has died. How do you sleep at night? - Not well. I do you plan on moving soon. - I don't blame you. Hey, I get off work most nights at 5:00. Why don't you and the kids and molly come for dinner sometime? I'm sure you could use a good home-cooked meal. - Molly? - Uh, silvia's mother. - Yeah, that'd be nice, thanks, hank. - Yeah, um, see you. (unsettling music) (footsteps clanging) - what are you doing? - Um, lily was feeling a bit down. I, I thought her stuffy might help. - I'd actually prefer to give that back to her myself. I wouldn't want her to get resentful of me. - Um, of course. Sorry I, I hadn't even thought about that. - I finished work for the day. I should probably get you home. - Mm-hmm. Here. Thank you. - [mother] you have to jump. - [young adrian] I don't want to. - Children get scared. If you are going to be a man soon. - I don't want to be a man. - You have to be brave. - [young adrian] I don't want to. - Adrian, either jump in that pool right this moment, or I will push you in there. - I don't want to. - Adrian, take those couple of steps and just jump. Go on, just jump. - I want carla! - Carla is gone, she doesn't want to babysit for you anymore. - [young adrian] no, no, no! - Do you know why carla left? Because of this bad behavior of yours. It's your fault. So you jump in that pool and be a good boy, and swim. - [young adrian] you swim. - [mother] don't you dare talk back to me. Now jump in that pool! (dramatic music) - [elaine voiceover] dr. Pauline cartwright used her own son for childhood analysis. Cartwright theorized that maturity could be induced if children were forced to take on the roles of an adult at a young age. Dying before her studies were published, her results have been inconclusive. - Hi, lainy. - What are you doing here, damon? - [damon] great to see you too. - Seriously, what is it? - Do you still wanna audition for company? Look, I know it's rocky between us, but you cannot let that get in the way of your dream. We have a few more days to practice. Let's make the most of it as dance partners. - I don't know. - Come on, lainy, don't you want this? - I don't know if I want this, damon. I don't know if I can handle being let down again. - You won't be. I booked the performance hall. Okay, we have one day to practice on the big stage, but we'll put you light years ahead of the other dancers. Okay, lainy, you're just so talented and- - you booked the performance hall? (couple laughing) (phone ringing) hello? - Hi, elaine. Sorry to call so late. I've got a bit of a proposition for you. Do you mind if I come over? - Uh, I'm actually with damon. We're gonna rehearse. - You're dancing again? With damon? - Yeah. We're trying to work on things. He booked the performance hall for tomorrow. You there? - The nightingale performance hall? - Yeah, that's where auditions are being held this year. - Elaine, that's, that's fantastic news. What I wanted to tell you is that I'm going to be moving to new york with the girls. They need closure and they're just not gonna get it here. I'm gonna need a live-in nanny, so if you do end up moving to new york maybe we can figure something out. - Yes, yeah that would be amazing. Um I, I will definitely think about it. - Please do think about it. I'm going to need a decision soon. - Yeah! Yeah, I'll talk to you soon. - You okay? (couple laughing) (foreboding music) (hank and adrian grunting) (dramatic music) (somber music) - (chuckling) I cannot believe you booked this. This must have cost a fortune. - I pulled some strings. - It's kind of spooky in here without the audience or the dancers. - Just the nerves. You ready? - Yeah. Ready. - All right, let's get warmed up.

Okay uh, take it from again from before the lift. - What's the point? - Excuse me? - You're gonna screw this up, if you don't get it out of your head. Dancers need to trust their bodies. - You're acting like this is my fault. - It's not my fault, I'm just looking out for you. - Just like getting that letter wasn't your fault? - Seriously, what are we doing? How many times do I have to tell you I have no idea where that letter came from? I didn't see her. Call charlie, he'll vouch for me. Look. I love you and only you, okay? I know you feel it when we dance. How our bodies move, it's like we were meant to be together. - Look, I'm gonna do the audition, okay? But if this doesn't work, I just, I need to figure out a future that's stable. - Okay. - Okay? - As long as you're happy. I love you. - Um, all right, let's get out of here. I gotta get ready for this interview. - I'm just gonna go tell the manager that we're heading out. - All right, I'll get changed. I'll meet you back at my place after. Wish me luck. (upbeat music) (object clanking in the distance) (menacing music) (dramatic music) (damon and adrian grunting) (damon gasping) - what do you want? - Elaine. - [mackenzie and lily] adrian! - Go wait in the car, okay? - [lily] okay. (girls laughing) - thanks for looking after the girls today. - I would like a schedule so I could see them more often. - We're going to be moving away, so that's just not gonna be possible. - I suspected as much. - What's this? - I am filing for custody. I will see you in court. - You two get in the car. - I'm gonna go to my room. - Where's my pegasus? - She's in my office, remember? Want to go get her? - Mm-hmm. Peggy! - [adrian] what do you say? - Please and thank you with sugar on top. - Where did you learn that? - From grandma, she says I'm gonna live with her soon. (gasping) peggy! - You are never going to live with grandma, okay? - I wanna live with her. - You need to grow up, lily. You need to learn that nothing in life is permanent. It's gonna help you mature. Go to your room now! (dramatic music) elaine, I wasn't expecting you. - Hey, adrian. - Why don't you come in? Are you all right? What, what's wrong? - Well I, I just came from my interview for the dance company. Um, I don't think it went so well. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Yeah but I, I wanted to tell you that I would love to accept the position whether or not I get into the company. - That's wonderful news. Are you sure? - Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about what you said about my strengths and purpose. I've always wanted to be a dancer, but lately it just seems like everything is working against that dream. When it comes to the girls, always been easy. - Well, you'll be compensated extraordinarily well. But we're going to need to leave right after your audition. - Oh, okay. (phone buzzing) - I'm so sorry, I've got to take this. - Sure. - Hello? - [lily] elaine. - Lily? - [lily] I'm right here. - Hey, lily-pad. What are you doing in your hiding spot? - He burnt peggy. I don't wanna go away with him. - Adrian burnt peggy? - Yes, I told him I want to live with grandma. - Oh, I know. Grandma is the best, but guess what? I'm gonna be coming with you guys. Adrian and I are gonna take good care of you, and I'll buy you a new peggy. - Pinky promise. - Pinky promise. - Elaine, I love you. - Aw, lil, I love you too. - [adrian] you tell her I will see her in court. - He's coming. He's gonna get me. - Oh, you're just being silly. I promise everything's gonna be fine, okay? Okay. I'll go. (subdued music) - sorry about that. - It's okay. - So we should, we should discuss the arrangements. - I actually have to run and do a couple things. I just wanted to let you know, but I'm happy to come back tomorrow. - Sure, of course. - Okay. - Elaine, I just wanted to tell you, you don't know what this means to me. - All right, well, I will see you tomorrow. - Tomorrow. - Sure. Oh and um, lily's in her hiding place, by the way. - Thank you. - Yeah. Hey, damon, I'm back from the interview, thought you'd be here. Give me a call. I want to talk to you about new york. (foreboding music) (silvia gasping) hi, detective munro, um, I just watched a video of, of silvia's death. I, I found it in, in um, adrian's... No. Oh. No, okay, no, no, you have to come here. Please send help. I'm at the corner of 43rd and hastings. Babe, don't go. Please. (elaine gasping) lily. (elaine sobbing) (dramatic music) (record player playing music) - now then, what are you two gonna call me? - Dad. - Very good. Lily? - Daddy. - And what happened to your mother? - She's gone forever because she doesn't love us. - And who does love you? - Dad. - Daddy. - And who else? - [mackenzie and lily] elaine. - How would you feel if elaine was your new mother? Would that make you happy? - Mackenzie? Lily? - Elaine. - Hi. - Everything all right? You look scared out of your wits. - I'm fine. Damon canceled. Where are the girls? - They're just washing their hands. Do you want to come in? We're just about to have dinner. (ominous music) do you mind taking the roast out of the oven? My family. Elaine, serve the peas. You look stunning. Cheers. - I thought once the girls were finished I could take them to the park. - That won't be necessary. You'll be pleased to know I've almost completed my study. - Congratulations, adrian. - Actually, I prefer if we kept things more formal at the table. Please call me doctor. - Congratulations, doctor. - It's quite remarkable. The new England journal has expressed an interest in my study. I've proven how the roles within a family are completely inalterable. For instance, a woman must be submissive while a man must be dominant in order for a relationship to survive. - What happens if she isn't submissive? - There are ways to teach her. - What about sofia? - Excuse me? - Your mother. What happened to sofia? - She didn't choose me. And as all children do, I lashed out. Something you would never do if such an opportunity arose. You have everything, elaine; an innocence, fragility, and you're obedient. You've hardly touched your dinner. - I'm not very hungry tonight. - Eat something! I insist. (ambulance siren blaring) (damon moaning) - it's gonna be okay, you're gonna be safe. - Agh! - Now that little stunt you pulled at dinner, that's just not going to fly, okay? So your roles are going to include all motherly duties. Everything that silvia may have done is now solely in your hands. And I hate to put it to you like this, but the apartment I found was only a two bedroom, so you and I are going to have to share a room. - I am not going anywhere with you. - What do you mean? (dissonant music) - I found this next to damon's body. He's dead. You killed him. - No, no, no, no, no, I saved you. I could give you everything, do not betray me. - Adrian, I saw the tapes. I saw what you did to silvia. I saw how terribly your mother treated you, but you can get help, okay? You don't have to be like her. - I am nothing like my mother! - Adrian, get off of me. - Can we play hide and seek? - I really want to play, please? Please? - Yes. Let's play. You two, stay with elaine. - We're gonna hide in the pantry. - I want to hide in the kitchen. - Sh, sh, um. What if we hide in mommy's room? - Mommy's room. - One, two, three, four, five. - [lily] we have to be quiet. - [adrian] six. - [lily] why aren't we in momma's room? - Seven, eight, nine. - Come on, we're gonna hide in my spot, outside, okay? - What? No way. - No, too high. It's really high. - Too scary, if you jump you're dead. - [mackenzie] she's right. - [lily] and it's really brr outside. - Okay, okay, um. - [mackenzie] yeah, never. - I need you girls to go downstairs and hide in your very best hiding spots. - Yep. - And don't come out until I find you. - Okay. - 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. Ready or not, here I come. (dramatic music) found you. (ambulance siren blaring) - agh! - Take it easy kid, hang in there. - A, a, adrian. Cartwright. (damon grunting) - take it easy. - One, two, three on lily. (elaine grunting) (dramatic music) elaine. Elaine. Give me your hand. What are you doing? Elaine, elaine! This is dangerous, elaine, now come inside. Come inside. - I am not going with you. - This is childish, elaine, look at what you're doing. Submit to me or fall. It's a long way, elaine, off this ledge you could die. Forget your dance career, choose me, elaine. Choose me. We could have the perfect family. I won't hurt you again. The perfect father, the perfect mother. - You are never gonna be their father. (adrian and elaine grunting) - you're mine! (police sirens blaring) (subdued music) - [detective] you did the right thing, elaine. - It's crazy how you cannot really know somebody. Maybe I just didn't wanna see him for what he was. - We believe we'll find proof of many more murders, including that of his mother. - I know he killed silvia. I have evidence of it in my apartment. - Hey, get him in the car! - What's gonna happen to him? - If the justice system does its job, he'll go to prison for the rest of his life. - Well, thank god. - Thank you, elaine. (somber piano music) - [dancer] let's do this. - Hey, beautiful. - Hi! What's up? - What's up, dude? See out there. - Okay. - You made it! - Of course, I'm not gonna miss my girlfriend's leading debut performance. - Did you bring the girls? - Yeah, they're in their seats already. - You're the best. I love you. - I love you too. - Okay, gotta go. - I'll see you after the show, yeah? - Definitely. - Break a leg. - Damon, it's good to see you off your crutches! Does this mean you and elaine are ready to move to new york? - I'm all bagged up and ready to go. - Excellent.
