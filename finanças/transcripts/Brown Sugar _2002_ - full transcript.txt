[On tape] So, when did you fall in love with hip-hop? Kool g rap: I basically fell in love with hip-hop, you know what I'm saying, when cats first started going out to the parks, you know, with the 2 turntables, the mic. I think it was 1977. People are rocking in the parks. I can remember back in the Bronx, 1979. Set up some turntables in front of the building. And we was getting the power from the street lamps outside. Plug it up into the street pole. Mc-ing, dj-ing, b-boying, break-dancing. Break-dancing or popping, beats or rhymes, you know. I was in love with it. Probably about 12 years old, man. And I was watching wild style. It was creative, it was new, it was fresh. Breakin', rappin', battlin'. It was the whole culture, period. The bambaataa show, the afrika islam show. It was just like our way of expression. Hip-hop spoke directly to me because, you know, it was speaking from the language that the people I was dealing with was speaking, and I loved it as soon as I-- as soon as I got introduced to it. I was gonna be dealing with hip-hop whether I wanted to or not. Like a forced marriage, it was predetermined. And I heard Eric b is president, and then that kind of changed my life. I heard the message, melle Mel. There was a rapper named Eddie cheeba who was one of the pioneers. When I first heard sugarhill gang. Rapper's delight. Rapper's delight. That set it off for rap music. Funky four plus one more. Plus one more, you know what I'm saying? Furious five, freedom. Run and them and Houdini freestyling. Sucka mc's by run-dmc. Sucka mc's live. Grandmaster flash on the wheels of steel. Grandmaster caz from the cold crush brothers. Cold crush. Cold crush. Cold crush. Grandmaster flash. Treacherous three, body rock. Spoonie gee, love rap. The first time I heard rebel without a pause. Eric b and rakim. Epmd and them. I gotta say public enemy as a group... You know. Classics, bangers. I mean, to this day they're bangers. I just love what it sounded like, and I loved what he was saying. You know, the whole slick tongue thing. I felt like these dudes hit the truth. Forget everything else you heard on the radio and all that. This is it. This is what I want to do. I was in. It was freedom. Sidney, voice over: I remember the exact day I fell in love with hip-hop. It was... Bye! [Play at your own risk by planet patrol playing] Yo, look, y'all! Look what they doing over there! Come on! [Men rapping indistinctly] ¶ The mic almost dropped but I catch quick ¶ ¶ and from that point we get hectic ¶ ¶ now, I score the ladies, I score the boys ¶ ¶ I am the one and only art of noise ¶ ¶ what up, hear, hear? ¶ [beatboxing] ¶ Dana Dane ¶ girl, up here! ¶ When out of nowhere dropped this fiendish fiend ¶ ¶ I want your shoes, your jewels, man, everything ¶ ¶ now in his hands, a knife, a gun ¶ ¶ I'm thinking to myself ¶ should I fight or should I run? ¶ ¶ I see his tool, slapped him up against the dome ¶ ¶ would you believe this fool ¶ ¶ tried to rob me with a comb? ¶ ¶ yo, Rick, my, my, ¶ ¶ my mellow, my man ¶ ¶ get on the mic and rock this jam ¶ ¶ well, I was on the 41 bus ¶ ¶ reading the news ¶ ¶ here comes grandma ¶ ¶ and she steps on my shoes ¶ ¶ I smile, although I was quite disgusted ¶ ¶ I said "what's the matter, granny ¶ ¶ is your blind ass dusted?" ¶ Sidney, voice over: The day I saw slick Rick, who went by Ricky d back then, Dana Dane, and Doug e. Fresh battle in the Bronx was the day I truly met hip-hop. Little did I know a year later Ricky d would would join the get fresh crew and record the hip-hop classic the show, and of course the b-side LA di da di. Dana Dane would drop a couple years later with his classic cinderfella. But little did I know how much hip-hop would be a part of my life. [Beatboxing] Hip-hop was as young, naive, confused, sometimes innocent, and sometimes as mischievous as I was. And as I grew up... Later, dre. Later, sid. Hip-hip grew with me, and along the way it took on all my baggage... My dreams. I felt hip-hop, and hip-hop felt me. And I know everyone who loves the music feels the same way I do. You know this little party going on out here is for you. I know. I'll be out in a minute. I know you can't be working. Today's your last day. It's the book. I got to turn in the pages by the end of the week. Dre's on the line. You want me to put him through? Yeah. Put him through. Sidney, on phone: What's up, baby? Hey, what's up, girl? You knew I wasn't about to let you leave without my ink, right? I know you don't have me on speaker, do you? No, no. I mean, yeah, but it's just me. So, what's good? Apologize first. What happened? Apologize first. You know the routine. Say it. "I'm sorry for being..." Uh, I'm sorry for being a self-centered, uh, ass. Actually change that to "impatient, arrogant ass." Ok, you can't be adding extras here, sid. Tell me something. Does Simon know you wet the bed till you were 12? Ok, ok, I'm sorry for being a self-centered, arrogant-- no break-dancing. You crazy, no, no, you-- no, I ain't crossing that line. Just say it, dre. I got your review in my hands. I'll put it at the bottom of the stack. Come on. All right. No break-dancing... No break-dancing ass who's taking advantage of his friendship with the beautiful, smart, the giving hip-hop writer of the Los Angeles times. New editor of double xl. The new editor of double xl for his personal professional advancement. Are you happy now? Mm-hmm. Congratulations. I think you've got another hit on your hands. Thank you, sid. Couldn't wait one week for the review to come out, huh? So what's the deal? You gonna be home in time for Russell's party? Oh, look at you. Like you're on a first name basis with Russell Simmons. Come on now, you know how I do it. Yes, I'll be home for the def jam party. My bags are packed. Cool. Cool. No, I cannot wait to see you, big time. All right, girl. Peace. All right. Bye, dre. Sidney, voice over: For many people, hip-hop was that first friend. The first to talk to us... The first to understand. Hip-hop has always been that kind of friend to me. And like any relationship, I've watched it grow. I've watched it change. ¶ Who's the one that can't comprehend at first? ¶ ¶ well, I may sound like a cell phone... ¶ [song becomes indistinct] Hey, sid Shaw. Hey, how you doing, beanie? Been trying, um-- what's up? I'm trying--me and my man fab are trying to get at you for the longest. What's up with that cover? Fab, how you doing? I'm working on it. Yo, for real? Yeah, yeah, I got you. Thirsty? Girl, I worked a double shift at the restaurant to get this night off. I'm about to have a ball. You should, too. I'm having fun. Oh, stop! [Both giggle] See? See, this is why I don't date. Only guys I meet are in the industry, and they ain't never got their shit together. What, like him? Sidney, voice over: Ever thought you'd see the day hip-hop grew up? From red kool-aid block parties in the Bronx to champagne toasts in soho. Ooh! Ha ha ha! What're you drinking, beautiful? Uh, um... That'll be a perfect 10 for the lady, if you please. And a ketel one Martini up with a twist for the gentleman. Get up off that chair and hug me, girl. What's up, baby? I have missed you so much. I missed you, too. How you been? Kiss it. Look at you. There you are. Oh, my God. I got you, I got you. Dre, stop it! I can't believe you left me over there with that man. Don't be mad. Kiss me, kiss me. Gimme a kiss, gimme a kiss. Yes, that's what I like. Sidney here is somebody I want you to meet. Oh, my God! Sidney, Reese. It's so good to meet you. Oh, my God! I've heard so much about you. Oh, well, I hope it wasn't too bad. No, and you look great. But I can't compete with you in that dress. Oh, please, I think you are wearing that dress. And your earrings are so beautiful. [Clears throat] Do you hear something, Sidney? Yeah, sounded like a male ego. Ha ha ha ha! That's real funny. Anyway, this is cute. Y'all should take this little act on the road. We're just teasing you. Oh, there's Steve. I gotta talk to him about the arista deal. Sidney... Good to meet you. Ok. Hurry up. I love you. I love you. Not bad, not bad. Mm-hmm. Yeah, she's pretty much amazing. Amazing? Mm-hmm. That's not a word I've heard you use to describe one of your women. Oh, she ain't like any of the others. For real. What's up? I want to show you something. Is that what I think it is? Yeah. Think I'm gonna do it tonight, sid. What? Uh-huh. Are you serious? Yeah. But, dre, you've known her for like 5 minutes. I know, I know, but, um... I--I think she's the one. So I'm retiring the "slow jams deluxe get the drawers" tape. The "slow jams deluxe get the drawers" tape? Yeah. The one with Luther, sade, and the extended mix of prince's adore, so... Damn, it's like that? I'm for real. What, why are you looking at me like that? I don't know. We're-- we're grown-ups. I'm so glad you're here. Oh, I'm happy to be here. Ohh! All right, I'm about to go in. You'll be fine. You'll be fine. Trust yourself. All right. My breath tart? No, you're cool. All right. Here we go. [Muffled] Ohh! Oh, my God! Dre, oh, my God! Yes, yes, yes! ¶ Was it good enough for you? ¶ girl, I can't believe you've been here damn near a month and you still not unpacked. I've been busy. I mean, there's this little job I have at this little magazine. Besides, there's order in this chaos. I know where everything is and where everything goes. So, uh, where does this go? Ooh! It's not what you think. It's a massager from brookstone. Oh, come on, sid, like I don't know-- it's a massager! Men take too much of your time. Time I don't have. You're turning into a Terry mcmillian character. Don't say that, that's cold! I'm telling you you're in trouble. Oh, it's just I never seem to find anyone on the same page with me. What, like dre? Oh, here we go. Come on. You're gonna tell me you never thought about hooking up? Dre asked me once when I was at Columbia if we should try being more than just friends, and...I told him no. No?! What is wrong with you, girl? I mean, we've been through everything together. Exactly. So if you two hook up, you get the best of both worlds. You get the buddy and the Booty. I hear you, but relationships break up. People get angry, they never want to talk to each other again. I mean, you're divorced. Terrell was your ace, right? You still talk to him? Me and terrell talk all the time. We talk about alimony, we talk about that tramp... Exactly, exactly. And you know dre. He's never been with a woman more than a month. Yeah, well, looks like he's gonna keep this one. Guess so. Ooh, she invited me to her bridal tea shower thingy, and I don't know what to bring. You haven't changed a bit. Want me to pick something up for you? Oh, would you, would you? I got you, cuz, I got you covered. You're the best cousin in the world. So what do you want me to do with your massager? High speed, low. [Both laughing] Reese: Sidney! You made it! Hi! Hey. Oh, thank you. I wonder what this is. Woman: And we called her Reese's pieces. Second woman: Ok, let's move on to the groom. I'll ask the same questions. What is dre's middle name? Fine. Romulus. What'd you say, Sidney? You know the answer? Romulus. That's right. That's the name of this shake dancer, works club Mozambique. Ok, aunt Betty. Ok, anyway... Romulus is right. What is dre's favorite drink? Cosmo. A polar bear. Ketel one Martini up with a twist, but if he's trying to show off, macallan 25. Right again. Macallan 25. All right, then. What is dre's favorite song? The bridge is over, boogie down productions. Ok, sid can't play anymore. She knows too much. Reese: Ok, let's move on to something else. How about... This is from moi. Oh, you guys, you guys! Ooh! Ohh! Honeymoon night only. You're so incredible. I love you so much. I'm glad you like them, darling. Ok, next, let's do... Sidney's gift. Thank you. Such a sweetheart. Nice. Very nice. They're gonna be perfect with my whip. [Women laughing] Sidney: I'm gonna kill France! I was so embarrassed, dre. And hungry. I bet you were. I mean, they didn't have anything but those little cucumber sandwiches with the crust cut off. Just keep the change. Thanks for meeting me. You're my dawg. [Giggles] It's good, huh? Mmm! I love these bad boys. It's true. I can't even front. Whenever I go out with Reese, we always going to some fancy spot with white tablecloths and a lot of silverware, hosting one of Reese's clients. I haven't had one of these bad boys since we started dating. Wow. She must really be something. Mmhh. Yeah, for sure. She's brown sugar. Oh, yeah, the brown sugar. Yeah. Break it down for me. You know, we all looking for wifey material. A woman that's fine, smart, classy, but not a snob. You know, hella--hella sexy, but not a ho. That's brown sugar. That's my reesey. I mean, don't get confused by her business suit. She is a freak in the bedroom... A little bit too much information. Hey, I'm just letting you know. Then on the converse side of things, you got the girls at the video shoots with their breasts all propped up and their booties hanging out of their dresses. I like to refer to them as the cyndi lauper honeys. They just like to have fun. Don't get it twisted. I'll tap that as well. Oh, I forgot being best friends with a man means I get to find out the stupid and simple ways they look at women. Well, that's how men are, stupid and simple. See, that's the problem with y'all women. You--you're all too complicated. You keep trying to change every man into the marrying type, and you just can't do it. Well, I guess Reese did a good number on you. Ooh, touché, touché, touché. And tell me, then... Dreski, what type am I? You could probably be in a video. Do this. Dre... Do this. Dre! [Beatboxing] Dre. [Huffs] What do you think about this for the mantle? That sounds so cool. I never had a mantle before. It's cute. It's not really you, though. Now this is tight. Oh, couples love that piece because it's not too masculine, it's not too feminine. I like to call it a compromising piece. Let me guess. Newlyweds, right? No, we just... Pu-lease, we are just friends, that's it. Oh, um, I'm sorry. I just thought, um... Well, if you need any help finding friend things just ask. Mm-hmm. Why you have to say it like that? Say what? Pu-lease. Like I ain't shit. 'Cause you ain't. Oh, damn it, see. I forgot. I'm supposed to check out this mc I want to sign tonight. What jail or group home does Simon have you going to now? Oh, that's funny. It's open mic night at Webster hall. What you doing tonight? Oh, I can't, dre. Aw, come on, sid. You remember how we used to do it. Club to club, up all night, eggs and bologna in the morning. Come on. I can't hang like that. I gotta get up in the morning. All right, we'll bump the eggs and bologna. You can do it. You got it in you. What? Hear the music. Unh, unh, unh. ¶ No eggs, unh, unh, unh ¶ ¶ no bologna, unh, unh, unh ¶ ok. Just dancing.

Uh, no, not right now. Nobody caught you yet? Hey, you doing me dirt, man. What's the deal? I see you. Why don't you take this man, give me a call. You really rip it on stage. I remember you, man. You used to, um, you used to hang up posters for def jam. Yeah. Ha! That's right. You got a good memory, man. That was back in the day, that was back in the day. Yeah, yeah. Seriously, though, we're trying to do some big things with you. We're looking for artists of your caliber. What's up? Why don't you take that and then shout me out real quick. You want to sign me for pennies and sell my publishing for millions? Oh, that's funny. You got jokes. For real, though, you're looking for a deal, probably, right? Why don't you take-- can I put this anywhere? Well, all right, but listen, to be honest with you, man, I'm not sure millennium is really ready for what I'm doing. It's on a different tip, you know. I've seen some of your artists. No dis. Oh, that's cool, man. We're trying to, you know, broaden our horizons. But I know where you're at, man. I'll get at you, man. I know where millennium at. I know where the office is at. Thanks for coming, man. I'm glad you felt it, man, all right? Yo, that was all right. Ok. There's dre. Yo, that's dre. Yo, yo. Excuse me, dre. Dre, yo. Yo, dre. Dre, we're ren and ten. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What's going on? How you doing, brother? My name is ren-- no, no, we decided I'm ren. All right, whatever, man. The hip-hop dalmatians, you understand what I'm saying? Yo, you get it? White with black spots. You know what I'm saying? Like, we represent that whole unity thing. You know, like one unit. U-n-I-t. Why? Because. Right. Thank you. I like that. Now, let's go. I'm doing some talking about the schematics for the album cover, ok? What we seeing is this. I'm gonna be standing there, right, we gonna have 101 dalmatians around. All around, all around-- boom-- and I'm gonna have a white fur coat with black spots. It's gonna be chinchillin'. I'm gonna rock a black fur coat with white spots, you know what I'm saying? We flip it on. Boom. Like, the audience, they like, "what?" They don't know. They're kinda confused 'cause we do one thing, we go 160 degrees to the other side. 160 degrees? Ren, stimpy. Stimpy? Rin tin tin. Dre: Rin tin tin--rin-- what can I do for you? All right, dre... It's ren and ten. Hip-hop dalmatians. D-a-l-m-a-- well, you know, "shens", man. Ren: No, he don't know. He don't know, dun sun. Let him know. I'm gonna tell you, dun sun. We your new group, dun sun! Oh! We just signed to millennium yesterday! Right? In your area. 2002, sun. Ren and ten. Look out, world. What's that about? What's gonna happen now? We're gonna take it all over, you and me. I mean and him, too. [Simon chatting with secretary] Hey, dre. Thank you, baby. Um, did you sign a new act without consulting me? Dre, I saw 'em and I had to sign 'em. I had never seen no shit like that. A black and white rapping duo. I know they gonna hit. Come on, man. You know that's just a gimmick. I mean, these guys they have, like, no skills. They're just straight up wack. Now I saw, last night, a real mc. This cat deserves a shot. He came with the real original, real, real hip-hop. I don't give a damn. I'm trying to sell records to people who'll actually buy them. So I need a group who is gonna be able to get me that mtv rotation, baby. Now, Ben and Ken-- ren and ten. They the future, baby. Now eminem, he paved the way. They're gonna be like Paul McCartney and Stevie wonder, you know? Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson. Whoo! They can do a remake of the girl is mine. Oh, shit. Hell, yeah! See, that's why I got you here. Oh, that's gonna be tight! I'm gonna be able to call it, uh, uh, uh... That ho is mine. [Chuckling] The ho is mine. Are you serious? Barber: Yeah, that's tight. You really want me to do this? Well, if you want to work for millennium records. That's what we do here. We make hits. Now, you wanna keep it real, you go to rawkus. We keep it profitable. Now, it's too hard to do both of 'em. Now, listen, dre... Go on to your little bachelor party, marry that fine-ass woman of yours, and have a nice honeymoon. When you get back, you gonna make it happen with ren and ten. Hmm? You hear what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Smart boy. [Knocking on door] I'm coming. What you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be at your bachelor party? Yeah. You know what? I was thinking about yesterday-- when I got my hat handed to me by that mc-- and I realized that I'm the character you're writing on when you say that hip-hop has lost its way. Dre, I was talking in general terms. Sid, I could--I could feel that look of yours from 3,000 Miles away. And I was ready, too. I was ready to leave millennium. You know, give them my high-minded speech and just bounce. Then I started thinking about the money, upward mobility, the suits... And I punked out. You didn't punk out. Well, you gotta admit, I punked out a little bit. Not even a little bite-sized, "melt in your mouth, not in your hand" punk out? Ok, maybe a tiny bite-sized punk out. See? Dre, we all sell out a little in our careers. It's how you survive the business. Why did it all get so complicated? I mean, all I wanted to do was make music, and now I'm not doing that. All I'm doing now is making deals and 10% of them is shady. All right, 30%. Fine, 50%. But you see what I'm saying? Come here. Come here. You'll be all right. Just trust yourself. Do you remember when we saw get fresh and the kangol crew? How could I forget? That was a good day. I wish I could go back to that day. It's gonna be ok. Uh... You'd better-- you'd better go. You'd better go. Mm-hmm. You'd better go. Uh, wait. Dre? Wait, wait. Uh... Are you sure you want to do this tomorrow? Yeah. Yeah, um... Yeah. Yeah. I love her and, uh... You know, I want to marry, um... Reese. I want to marry Reese. I love her. Ok. Well, uh... You better get to that bachelor party. See those strippers. Right. Right. Ok. Peace. Bye-bye. [Door closes] [Organist playing] What was that about? What? What was what about? He just looked at you like you had 3 breasts. What happened? Nothing. Nothing happened. Francine: Wait a second. You boned him, didn't you? Sidney: Shh! [Whispering] No, I didn't. [Whispering] Oh, you little ho. What you gonna do? Nothing! It was just a little kiss. Tongue? A little bit. [Organist plays the wedding march] Did you feel anything? It was a mistake! Mistake my ass. She gonna marry your man. Dre is not my man, he's my friend. That's it, end of discussion. Guests: Shh! Reverend: Ladies and gentlemen, please be seated. You're just gonna let it go down like that? Do you Reese Marie whigham... Can we talk about this later? Why? You only think you're friends? That's your man up there. Francine, shut up! Say something! ...till death do you part? I do. She don't even know him. Do you, Andre romulus Ellis, take Reese Marie whigham... You're seriously gonna let her marry him? Yes! France! ...to hold in sickness and in health, for richer, for poorer, till death do you part? I do. He don't mean that. The rings. Say something. If there is anyone here who has just cause why these two should not be lawfully married, let them speak now... That's your man up there. Francine, shut up! Say something then. Shh! [Clears throat] By the power vested in me by the state of New York, I now pronounce you-- husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. I can't believe it. I present to you, Mr. and Mrs. Andre Ellis! [Organist plays the wedding march] Sidney, narrating: The union of hip-hop to the mainstream was a hard thing to imagine. Hip-hop was always this personal, regional thing that belonged to just me. Starting with fab 5 Freddie and yo! Mtv raps! Anyone with a television set and cable box could get a piece of hip-hop. I knew I was gonna have to share, and that was hard to get used to. ¶ One shot to your heart without breaking your skin ¶ ¶ no one has the power ¶ ¶ to hurt you like your kin ¶ ¶ kept it inside, didn't tell no one else ¶ ¶ didn't even wanna admit it to yourself ¶ ¶ and now it just burns and your back aches ¶ ¶ from 15 years of holding the pain ¶ ¶ and now you only have yourself to blame ¶ ¶ if you continue to live this way ¶ ¶ get it together ¶ ¶ get it together ¶ yeah, not next Wednesday, but the Wednesday after. Ok, looking forward to it. Hot 97 called again. They still want you to come in for an interview. Tell 'em I can't do it right now. I got too much on my plate. And we just got the release dates for kelby Dawson's album. It works with our next issue. Great, when can we get an interview? Tomorrow night. The nets are playing the Knicks on Wednesday, so if you're free-- mm-mmm. Get rashad to do it. Well, here's the thing. According to his agent, he specifically asked for you. [Sighs] Look, you need to catch a man, but you not dangling the right bait. I look fine. You dangle enough for the both of us. Ok, now look, I know you don't want to make that little friend of yours jealous, but you need the real thing. It's a massager from brookstone. Whatever you want to call it. Listen, you got to go inside, Katrina's gonna hook your hair up, then we gonna get you some real clothes so you look incredible for your date with kelby Dawson tonight. I'm meeting kelby on business. This isn't a date. But it's an opportunity, so you gotta dangle. I'm not gonna dangle. All right, all right. He's here. No. No, I'm not. They're dangling enough already. Bye. Sidney Shaw. How are you? Good. How you doing? Good. Kelby Dawson. I'm sorry I'm so late. I'll try not to hold it against you. And thanks for the drink. How'd you know I like perfect 10s? I've got my sources. Well, thanks for giving us this interview, especially considering you don't do much press. Were you surprised? Well, yeah. I don't know too many professional athletes that avoid the spotlight. I thought all you guys wore diamonds in each ear, minks, and did the cabbage patch in the camera after you make a free throw. The cabb-- that's funny. But you're wrong about the mink. Hi! Kelby: So, perfect 10, huh? I've never tasted one. Dre: Hey, y'all. Talk to you later. What's up? Hey, dre. How you doing? Hi. Dre: I didn't even recognize you. You look so amazing. You look nice.

Cell phone: The name cannot be recognized. Sidney Shaw. Cell phone: The name cannot be recognized. What am I doing? What am I doing? This is mess with dre day, huh? Huh? Do I know you? Oh, Jesus. Remember me, man? The world is small as hell, ain't it? Yeah, man. What happened, man? That menudo reunion deal fell through? You got jokes, don't you? What you doing driving a cab anyway? Your English is too good. Trying to stay out of trouble is what I'm doing. What's up with you? What's going with millennium? I left millennium today. What? Yeah. What, so Simon owe you some money or something? Uh, no. Nothing like that. He hang you out a window or no shit, did he? You know what, this whole taxicab confession thing, we don't really got to do. If you could just keep driving? Hey, not a problem. Pardon me. Not a problem at all. He try to steal your girl or something? No, man! I'm married. Ain't nobody giving it to my wife but me. Chris: I feel you. You want to know why I left millennium? Sure. Sure, whatever. Man... I left millennium 'cause I was tired of making bullshit and calling it hip-hop, man. I was just tired. I feel you. I couldn't take it no more. Hey, man... I had to bounce. That's tight, man. I respect that. You respect that? Yeah. [Laughing] It's like the grinch who stole hip-hop growing a heart. You got a grown-up heart now. You gonna go back to whoville and give all the hip-hop whos their publishing back? That's funny to you? I'm just playin' with you, man. Pull the cab over. What, you don't want to go to Brooklyn no more? You hurt my feelings. No, bro, I was just playing, man. Don't take it like that. Keep the change, man. Thank you, bro. Hey, listen, man, don't let that shit get you down, man. Stay black, man! [Repeating] ¶ make you feel that way ¶ ¶ make you feel that way ¶ ¶ make you feel that way ¶ ¶ make you feel that way ¶ ¶ make you feel that way ¶ ¶ up and early for the hope of a brand new day ¶ ¶ see a homie you ain't seen since back in the day ¶ ¶ fresh haircut fitted wit a fat ass fade ¶ ¶ end of work, we chilling on a Saturday ¶ ¶ how you felt when you first heard the daddy Kane ¶ ¶ rakim, krs, hey I had that tape ¶ sid? Excuse me? Man: Yeah, can I get you to sign this for me? Thank you. Thanks. What's up, baby? Can you believe this? Oh, my goodness. They're from kelby. You must give good interviews. He wants a date. Yes, he does. Now, see I would've just written you a little note that said, "will you go out with me?" With a "yes" box, "no" box, and a "maybe" box. Yeah, you've always been such a romantic. You, uh... You got a minute? Yeah. What's going on? Dre: All right, how about this one? Ok, ok, ok. ¶ Yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop ¶ ¶ and 1, 2, common says the beat's a sure shot ¶ come on, dre. It's common sense. I used to love h.E.R. You said his name. It's one of the tightest cuts of all time. ¶ I met this girl when I was 10 years old ¶ ¶ and what I loved most she has so much soul ¶ ¶ she was old school, when I was just a shorty ¶ ¶ never knew throughout my life ¶ ¶ she would be there for me ¶ yeah, man. See, that's why I write and don't rap. [Laughs] For real. That song reminded me of us. It does? Yeah, back in the day. Do you remember that feeling? Just how hip-hop used to make you feel? Especially back then. It was so real. It was like air. Do you remember how you felt the first time you heard the bridge is over? The first time? Yup. That was real. Ooh, or, um... You gots to chill. The sophomore skate party? Bonita applebum. That was a tight one. Mm-mmm. And Paul revere. Ooh, I used to loved that. See, now that beat was tight. The Beastie Boys. Yeah, man, they came with it. Mm-hmm. You know... I don't have that feeling no more. You know what I'm saying? I cannot remember the last time I had that feeling. I can't-- I can't-- you ready to talk? What's on your mind? I quit today, sid. I left millennium. I just walked away from it all today. So, whatcha gonna do now? I'm thinking... I'm thinking I could start my own label. You know? Yeah. Um, you know, make music that I want to make. Music that I think should be out there. You know what I mean? Bring on artists and treat 'em like partners. Make my money the right way. Shoot. Be one of the good guys for a change. You think I'm crazy? I think you're the bomb. For real? I think you're the bomb. For real-real? Yes. Damn. That's great, dre. I can already see us at the grammys, basking in your success. Oh, I like how that sounds. The grammys. Damn, dre, that's great. I'm scared, sid. So, how-- how are you going to-- you got the money? Uh, I mean, I got a little something-- a little something saved. I'm gonna have to hit up other sources, but... You know, I ain't gonna really stress about that. That's the last thing I need to be worrying about now. I'm gonna start out with one artist-- what you doing? You just found another source. Sid, stop playing. I ain't-- take it. No, I'm not taking that money from you. Come on. Look, you are my best friend. There's nobody that believes in you more than me. So you're taking this check, you're starting that label and it's gonna be hot. [Church bell chiming] All right, girl. [Sighs] Ow! I can't believe you sometimes. Whoo! So what you doing tonight? We gonna celebrate or what? I can't, I have-- I have a date. Oh, with kelby? Yeah. So you said yes, huh? What's this cat's number 'cause I'm gonna call him up and cancel for you 'cause you hanging with me tonight. Uh-uh. For real. I got to go. It's like that? Just put the money on the nightstand and bounce? Leave a brother hanging? Bye, dre. No kissing on the first date. Bye, dre. Sidney, narrating: Just when you think you know everything there is to know about hip-hop it finds a way to surprise you and remind you why you fell in love in the first place. Good evening, miss Shaw. Welcome to chingalle's. How'd you know my name? Please, this way. Sidney: Oh, my goodness. Thank you. Thank you, jarmelle. Perfect 10s. Thank you. Whoa, whoa, easy. [Laughs] Thank you. I'll be right back. Ok. Hey, reesey-piecey. Hi, baby. How you doing? How was your day? Interesting. Oh. I forgot. I took your phone again. Oh! Yeah, I know. I kept getting phone calls from all your ex-girlfriends. Here. Thank you, baby. Baby... Mmm? Mmm... I love you... And, uh, ahem... I quit my job today. Why? [Sighs] 'Cause, baby, I just-- I needed to. I had to. I-- [sighs] I'm gonna start my own label. I'm gonna do all the things that I've ever wanted to do. I thought you were doing all of that at millennium. No, not at millennium. I wasn't. I mean, you know how much I love music, how much I love hip-hop, how it makes me feel, dre-- and I lost that love at millennium. How could you make a change like this without consulting me? 'Cause this is something I had to do for me. Plus, I know you would've just tried to talk me out of it, and-- it's not fair for you to assume that. You don't know that. Reese, you mean to tell me, had I told you, you wouldn't have tried to talk me out of it? Yes, I would have tried to talk you out of it, but I'm supposed to do that. You get so excited, and you don't think straight, and then you do something like this. You can't make a major life decision just because you feel like it-- I don't need you to be my lawyer! Reesey, I need you to be my wife. And a husband is supposed to consult his wife when he changes the plan. And a wife supports her husband! Baby, I need your support! Ok, fine. I support you. I'll call some money people. We'll get this squared away. That's all taken care of. Uh... Sid said she'd help out with some of the investing, and-- Sidney? Sidney knew about this before me? Reesey, baby, please, you know she's my friend-- your friend. [Claps] Ok. Damn, dre. Reese. Well, I see you have it all under control. I'm really happy for you. Who, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow your roll. Reesey! Reese! No, you slow your roll. Reese! Dre? I'm fine. Sidney: You did all right. [Laughs] Kelby: Just all right. Ok. So--so, you're used to guys closing down restaurants on their busiest nights, huh? Commandeering the kitchen, serving you like a queen. You're used to all that, huh? You ballplayers. All right. I didn't think so. You think you're gonna get some Booty, don't you? Well, yeah. Yeah? [Laughs] That's the plan. One of these days. Come on, that's what this is all about. You know, the dating, the awkward walks home. That's what men and women do. You got it all figured out, don't you? I'm just tryin' to be straight up. [Sighs] You put a man and a woman together long enough, and... Something's gonna go down. Well, what makes you think you gonna be around long enough for something to go down? Well, I think I got a pretty good shot. It's not that good. Especially outside 20 feet. And you could work on that d a little, too. Oh, really? Really. Ok. Come here. How was that shot? Nothin' but net. Dre: Vichon. Chris vichon. V-I-c-h-o-n. He's a driver. No, no, it's not a complaint. He's a driver. Never mind. Thank you for your time. [Telephone rings] [Rings] Hello? Dre, whispering: Whassup? Who is this? It's dre. Dre? You do realize the hour, right? Well, why you whispering? Shh! Quiet. How was the date? Good. "Good" like, "I had a great time, but I gotta go" or "good" like, "I'm gonna stay for dessert"? Good like, I'll have dessert, a walk along the promenade, coffee, which I'm making now. [Gasps] Sidney! Is he still there? Mm-hmm. Damn! You must like him a lot. Dre, the man cooked for me. So? I cooked for you. Burnt fried bologna and eggs hardly qualifies as cooking. I'm sayin', though, did you actually see him cook for you? You actually saw me cook for you. Did you actually see him cook for you? No. Tsk... He's runnin' game on you. That nigger ain't cook for you! Dre, why would he say it if he didn't? So he could get you to make him coffee in the middle of the night so he could tap that. I'm a dude. I know these things. Well, his game worked. Ohh! Sidney! For real? Is y'all gonna do it? Bye, dre. Sidney! Bye. Sid! Sidney! Sidney! There you go. Thank you. Mmm. [Chuckles] This is good coffee. Mmm. This is really good. Yeah, I, uh-- I got it from balducci's. Mmm. It's a great aroma. Ahem. Let's have sex now. Let's. Excuse me, sir. I'm looking for a, uh, Chris vichon. He's in there. Does he-- right there. Oh, ok. Thank you. Watch it. [Chris singing] What's up, partner? What's up, man? What you doin' here? Uh... Actually, I, um... I'm, uh, ahem-- I'm startin' my own label, and, uh, somebody told me that this real nice mc works here. You--you know him? What you want, grinch? What you want me to do, some mother goose raps? "There was an old ho that lived in a shoe." No, I ain't lookin' for that no more, man. I'm lookin' for some real stuff. I don't get you, man. One day you all shiny-suited up, then the next day, you head to the garage lookin' for the raw shit. Well, what you got goin' on, man? What? You waitin' for some label to come and scoop you? You-- what's your hook? See, that's the difference between me and you, dog. I don't need no hook. My skills is my hook. You're an mc that drives a cab. A taxicab! Let me tell you something. First of all, I got a job. I didn't come to millennium askin' you for shit. Hey, man, I got a job, too, all right? But I ain't too proud to ask for help. Maybe you should be more proud. 'Cause your rep is like this. Come on, man, I know you was comin' down here to do it, man. You just signed the hip-hop cartoon puppies. You think you could rap with me? Spotted dalmatian, smothers brothers dudes. What am I supposed to trust you for? All right, man. You got me. All I know is I'm here, man, all right? All I can give you is my word. I'm tryin' to do something real. The way I see it, real mc'ing, that's the hook. That could be our hook. That's my vision. All right? No shiny suits, no bling-bling, no spotted furs. This is the real deal. On the humble? I need you, man. You want-- you wanna help me? Yeah, man. You really wanna help me do something? Yeah. All right. Hold this. Take this. Hook up my back seat. All right, I'm gonna just-- I'm gonna place it here, I'm gonna get you some coffee. How long is it gonna take you to clean the back seat? Oh, you-- you want me to clean the back seat? I mean, if it's too gully for you, it's all good. No, no, no, no! No. I mean, yo, I'm gully. Oh, yeah, you gully? Yeah! I don't want you to mess up your nails or nothin', you know what I mean? I'm gully, man. I mean, you do something for me, I do something for you, right? That's how it goes, man. Right? You good? I'm gully. All right. You find any change back there, it's mine, ok? Cool. I got you. All right, open a window so you don't breathe that stuff in. I'm gonna open up a window. Gully. I'll talk to you. Give me a call. I will. I promise. All right. See you. Man: Look at you! Good to see you. Hey, Reese. Sidney, hi! Hey, how you doing? I never see you in here. Well... I usually don't have the time, but... Ever since dre started this record label project, I've had a lot more free time. So I guess I actually have you to thank for bringing me back to class. Me? Yeah. You know? For all of your support of dre and his project. [Whistle blows] Instructor: All right, everybody, listen up. We're just about ready to go. I want you to find a partner, grab a pair of focus mitts. We're gonna do some punch combos. Alternate on my whistle. [Whistle blows] Oh, thanks. I'm already working with my man right here. Just you and me. Sidney: Whoa. Ohh! You ok, Reese? [Laughs] Oh, yeah, I'm fine. I'm just... Fine. I'm-- [Laughs] I'm just... Thankin' you. Ok, Reese. [Laughs] We're both big girls. Let's let it out. You have a problem with me and my friendship with dre? No, I don't have a problem with your friendship with dre. I have a problem... That you're in love with dre. What? It's understandable. Dre's an incredible man. Listen, me and dre have been through a lot together. So, yes, I love him as a friend, like a brother, but that's it! [Whistle blows] Friend, brother, whatever. He--he lets you in... In a way that he hasn't let me in yet. And all the secrets... I have to... Beg for... You already know! So just maybe the fact that... You're that close... Bothers me! [Whistle blows] I realize my friendship with dre may make things awkward... But I am not gonna apologize for it! I don't want you to apologize for it! That's not what I'm saying. I knew you were friends with dre when we got married, but this is not what I expected. This was not part of our plan. I never see him any-- more... Because of this... Record label thing! You just said "record label thing," like it's a hobby or a distraction. This label is more than just a thing to him! Well, you know, like I said, I guess... You know him better than I do. ¶ You take ¶ ¶ you take ¶ ¶ you take ¶ ¶ you take ¶ ¶ yeah, yeah, let's do it ¶ ¶ I know you're ready, right? ¶ ¶ then let's do it ¶ ¶ we'll do it next to it ¶ ¶ put your arms and legs next to it ¶ ¶ and rock whatever else is left to it ¶ ¶ you take ¶ ¶ you take ¶ ¶ when you invited me ¶ ¶ like this, like a mad clean ¶ ¶ like, focus, man ¶ ¶ you got to give it to me ¶ ¶ you need to give it to me ¶ ¶ you better give it to me ¶ ¶ give me some fine, fine ¶ ¶ give me brown sugar ¶ ¶ leave the ground shook up ¶ ¶ got the world sweatin' like fiends without hookup ¶ ¶ come on ¶ ¶ you take ¶ ¶ you take ¶ ¶ you take ¶ ¶ when you invited me ¶ ¶ you got to give it to me ¶ ¶ you need to give it to me ¶ ¶ you better give it to me ¶ ¶ give me some fine ¶ ¶ brown sugar ¶ ¶ leave the ground shook up ¶ ¶ observe the way, how we make it sound ¶ ¶ word up, like, you got to give it to me ¶ ¶ you need to give it to me ¶ ¶ you got to give to me ¶ ¶ give me brown sugar ¶ ¶ lick your lips to it ¶ ¶ work your hips to it ¶ ¶ steady rockin' like this to it ¶ ¶ you take ¶ ¶ damn, baby ¶ ¶ you take ¶ ¶ damn, baby ¶ ¶ you take ¶ ¶ damn, baby ¶ ¶ damn!

All: Whoo! Yeah! All right, y'all. Hold up. I got something to say. Since this is the last meal uh, of the year, I would like to propose a toast. Man: Hey. Yeah. Um, I'm a little-- little bit twisted, so--so don't hold me responsible for anything I might say. Yeah, but we won't hold you sis-sponsible. [All laugh] Dre: Anyway, this has been a hell of a year, as all of y'all know, full of ups and downs. Um... For one, I married this beautiful young woman beside me--mmm-- which is cool. But I also lost my job at millennium. No, no, bruh, the job lost you. [Laughs] That's right! Yeah, ok, I like that. I like that. But because of it, I, um--I was able to start my own label. All, clapping: All right! Whoo! That took a lot of courage. Thank you. I would like to thank all of y'all for all of y'all's support during this, uh-- this time. I would especially...[Sighs] Like to thank my best friend, who, uh, left that 75-degree weather to come back home. You are the perfect verse over a tight beat. All: Ooh! Word up! Dre: To hip-hop. And to the new year! All: Yeah! To the new year. Hippy-hip-hip! Yeah! Chris: Yeah, yeah! Ok. Let's get to the food! Yeah! Excuse me. Uh, since--uh, since we're all celebrating, I'd like to--excuse me. I'm sorry. I'd like to take this to another level. Ok, bruh, could we just stop at the food level real quick, though? Let me just do this-- do this real quick, and then-- and then we'll eat. Thank you. All right. Can I have one-- one, uh-- one second, please? Let me take this. Ok. Ahem. Man: Ohh! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my goodness. Oh, shit, we ain't never gonna eat now. I love you so much. Would you do me the honor of being my wife? I don't--I don't know what to say. Say yes. Yes. All: All right! Aah! Yeah! Yes. Sidney: So, what is the difference between rap and hip-hop? It's simple. It's like the difference between saying you love somebody and being in love with somebody. Rap is just a word. Um, what are you doin'? Gettin' more to drink. You know what I'm talkin' about. Gettin' into this whole... Marriage thing. Don't you think this is just a little too fast? You've only known the cat for a couple months. About as long as you knew Reese before you got married. That's why you doing this? This whole competition thing? What, I marry Reese and you marry sasquatch? Oh, so now I'm doing this 'cause of you? You arrogant son of a bitch! You really on your own sack right now. So I guess since I can't marry you, I'm marrying kelby. No, no, no, no! No, that's not what I meant. No. Hey--sid, that's not what I meant. Sid, don't-- sid! Sidney! You need to talk to your friend. [Laughs] What y'all goin' through? You crazy. Ahh, here we go. [High voice] Hey-- hey. Hey. What you doing? Just gettin' these champagne flutes. [Chuckles] Yeah, that's funny. You ever wonder why they call them champagne flutes? [Laughs] No, I never really thought about it. Oh, shoot! Hey, don't break the flute now. [Laughs] If you find out, get back to me and let me know. I will. Hey, that's a nice outfit. You look real-- real nice. And the food was tight, too. It was tasty and nutritious. Oh, shit. Tasty and nutritious. Oh! Hey. Hey! Hey, what's goin' on? Congratulations, man. It's a big move. Good luck to you, man. Look, I've been meaning-- I've been meaning to talk to you about my album, man. About my album, you know? Your album? Yeah. Oh... [Drunk] It's so hard to get respect as an mc when you're a ballplayer. Right, right. Rappers who play sports. Yeah. Yes. Same thing. But I was thinking, you could be my mentor. Right. You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah. Like, you could help me with my lyrics. You could work it out so my-- my--my lyrics get tight. Tight. Tight lyrics. Right. Like a-- like a rap coach. Like a-- like a rap coach! Right. Like, exactly! ¶ New year's Eve ¶ ¶ kelby d in the venue ¶ ¶ popped the ring ¶ ¶ got marriage on my menu ¶ marriage on my menu, man! That's tight. It's not just basketball with you. Yo. Yo! Dre? Dre! Yo, you got a 2-way, man? Yeah. Dre? Anybody seen dre? Kelby: Yo, you got a number? Hey, dre. Hey, you all right? Yeah. Come over here real quick. Hey, uh, what's up with, uh, Sidney's homegirl? Sidney--oh. Francine? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. She's cool. [Chuckles] You feelin' her? He was all nervous, though. It was kinda cute. [Laughs] Called my food delicious and nutritious. [Laughs] He did? We was talkin' a little bit, you know what I'm sayin'? You slick dog! You feelin' her, man! So spit at her, man! She's real cool. No, no, no, no! That's what I'm sayin', you know. I don't wanna just, you know, overwhelm her with all my game, you know? I wanna conserve my game. I don't wanna just blow it all on one shot-- you ever notice how when a guy's tryin' to mack you, his voice either go real high or real low? Mm-hmm! So, I was figurin', like, you know, you drop a bird to Sidney-- shh! Chris. It's cool. If you're scared, just tell me you scared. Just tell me. We cool! No, I'm--I'm not scared. I'm not scared. Listen, if you're scared of women-- whoa, whoa! Ooh, bro, why you talkin' all loud, man? You don't know with this party. This is how rumors get started. What's wrong with you, man? So, you gonna give him any play? I don't know. He kind of young. First of all, I ain't scared of women, but I ain't like you. Ok? I ain't the black male model. I don't be in the gym at all times. Forget it, man. Don't even say nothin', man. It's cool. I got you. I got you. Let's go. You gonna hook me up, man? Don't play me, man. Kelby: Mentor! [Laughing] Got marriage on my menu! Kelby? You know what I think? You should hire a lawyer to negotiate your contract. You serious? Yeah, I mean, why pay an agent 4% to negotiate numbers that are already set by a salary base cap? Dre, don't say anything. Quit while we still have a friendship. Hey, that's what I'm tryin' to do right now. I'm trying to save our friendship. I'm worried about you. Worried about me? Yeah! You need to stop worrying about me and worry about your own marriage. So you're-- excuse me. So you're the attorney I'm supposed to hire, right? Yeah! Very good! [Laughs] Dre: My marriage? What you mean? What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. Nothing. Sidney. What's that supposed to mean? Kelby: Maybe this is not the best place-- the best time to talk business, but I'm sure we'll have plenty of opportunity since our spouses are best friends. Best--best friends. They're so close. Yeah, well, how--how do you feel with them being so close? Well, let's just say it's very hard to get used to. Sidney, what did you mean?! Sid-- can we just drop this already? Tell-- tell me what you meant. Nothing. No! You said... Te-- nothing. Just... Tell me. All right. Nothing. It's nothing. It's just I--I've been seeing her at the gym a lot lately, and...[Sighs] A lot of guys try and run game on her, and, I don't know, she don't seem to mind. Hmm. She's a flirt. All right? She flirts-- she flirts a lot. She's always been a flirt. And she's flirted with me. I'm cool with that. She flirt. Ok. That's what I thought. You're probably right. It's when you talk like that, that's what makes me think that you're jealous. What?! Yes. Jealous! No wonder you two are married. You're both crazy! Look here, contrary to what you and your wife may think, I don't spend my nights thinkin' about you, ok?! I got a man who's fine, intelligent, successful, and gives it to me on a very, very regular basis, and the shit is the bomb! So? I don't care what-- dre, I need you to be happy for me. I need you to be there for me, just like you asked of me. So--so I can have tea and eat cucumber sandwiches with the crust cut off! [Laughing] [Laughs] [Laughs] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Ahem. You're upset. I'm sorry. I'm, uh-- for real... I'm, uh-- I'm happy for you. I'm happy for you. I'm happy for you, just like you was happy for me. All right? Cool? All right, can I get a hug? Good friends. You tore up those cookies. ¶ Oo-ooh ¶ ¶ ooh ¶ ¶ oo-ooh ¶ ¶ ooh ¶ ¶ ooh--ooh ¶ ¶ oo-ooh ¶ ¶ ooh ¶ Sidney: Nice shot. Hey, beautiful. Hey. Mmm... What you got there? I, uh... Wanted us to make the final decision on these invites. All right. Well, whatever you want is cool with me. It's all you. What's wrong? I just needed a writing break. Oh. I mean, writin' these articles here and there is one thing, but... This book is different. I really want it to be good, you know? Yeah. And, uh... I don't know if I can write at that level. Of course you can! Can I ask you something? Yeah. What did you think of the underground review I wrote on Cassius in last month's issue? That was good. That was really good. Really? Yeah. What was good about it? You know, everything. I mean, the-- yeah, the whole-- the whole thing was great. It was really good. You didn't read it, did you? What? Oh, yeah, no. Um... What about the one before that? Uh... Well, the one you wrote about me was great. [Laughs] Hey, I'm sorry. Look--look... I've been on the road. You know how it goes. Look, I promise I will read every article you've ever written in your life. Everything. Like your essays, your little love letters, everything. Ok? Every single thing. For you. [Buzzer] All right, I gotta go, Ms. Dawson. Oh! Oh, my bad. [Laughs] See you. [Music playing] So, this is where my money's going? Ha ha. That's called brain food right there. [Cell phone rings] Richard? Who's Richard? [Turns off music] Yo, Chris. What's up? You got your cab with you? Wait a minute. Dre. Dre. Sidney: Oh, no. That guy goes to our gym. Dre, think about this, ok? Let's just go. [Sighs] Dre, you don't want to do this. Dre: What's up? Surprise! Reesey, what-- huh--you-- how--are you doin'? Hey... Hey... Hey... Guys, what's up? How are you doin'? Ha ha... It's funny runnin' into you here, singing love songs to each other. Dre... Shit, that was pretty. Don't stop on my account. Oh, dre... Yeah. Me and sid, we was just in the neighborhood. We thought--you mind if we join you? No, not at all. Not at all. Richard: Have a seat, man. Right. Sit down, girl. Why you all stiff? Reesey... I see you got on my... Favorite dress with this area all, like, "hey." All out. Greased up for my man. I'm sorry. Dre Ellis. You are? Richard Lawson. [Imitating him] Richard Lawson. All right. You sound educated. Good for you, girl. I, um... You guys, um, friends of Reese's? Yeah, well, actually, the funny thing is, she's my wife. What? Richard: Oh... Look, hey, I'm sorry. I didn't-- that's cool. That's cool. How could you know? She ain't wearing the $15,000 ring that I bought her ass. I'm still paying it off, but you understand. Actually, I'm paying for it. Could you not put my business out on the street? Will you be joining us for dinner? Listen, my man-- you know what? We were just about to leave. I'm trying to order the most expensive bottle of champagne, 'cause we fixin' to celebrate. Dre. We gonna celebrate what? [Taps spoon on glass] ¶ My divorce ¶ how about that? And some pork chops. Dre, come on. 'Cause I'm kind of hungry. All right? You're making a scene. Good. I want to make a scene. You know what I'm sayin'? Bye-bye, Richard Lawson. Sidney: This is so embarrassing. I can't believe you got me to do that. Hey, stop complaining. You forget it was me who helped you let all the air out of Shawn's tires when he asked Angie to the homecoming dance instead of you. Key word: Home...Coming. High school. We're almost 30 years old, dre. [Sighs] Oh, time is a bitch. I swear, I still feel like we're just those 2 kids pop-locking at the block parties. You remember my first little beat machine? Boy, you thought you were d-nice. The tr-808. Bust this. [Clears throat] "Simplicity provides "a fine line between eloquence and plainness." That's a dope line. And I know ll didn't think he was that deep. That was my first published article. I can't wait for your book to come out. And when you left, I went out, got the L.A. times, every Wednesday, for your column. I'd go to the park and read it. I don't know, it just... Made me feel closer to you. Uh... You want anything? Coffee? Vodka? Uh, no. I wanted them pork chops. I told you we should have stayed for dinner. How can you... Joke about this? 'Cause I would be flipping out. Ha ha! Sid, I do not know. I guess I'll break down later. You know what, though? I--I-- I'm glad I know now. I guess I always knew deep down inside that we weren't meant to be together. Yeah? Mm. And when did you figure that out? The night before the wedding. Something happened between me leaving the house... And, uh... Getting to the wedding. But, you know, I shook it off, 'cause, damn, I had a beautiful woman that loved me to death. So, you know, I took all those feelings and...Locked them away, 'cause not everybody can marry their one true love. It was a pretty difficult situation. Do you, uh... You know anybody like that? No, I don't. No? But... I do know somebody that was friends with this guy a long time, and... She thought maybe it was more than just... Friends, but... Something happened to her, coincidentally, before your wedding. Oh, yeah? And...She realized it was nothing more than just friends. Nothing? Nothing. Just friends? Just friends. Sidney: I can't believe what just happened. Dre: I know. I don't know what to say. I mean, usually I'm like the energizer bunny. You know. I keep goin' and goin'-- I was talking about us... Doing it. This was bad. We made a huge mistake. Honey, I said I was sorry. I mean, next time I won't be so caught off-guard. I'll use a little ginseng. There isn't gonna be a next time. Don't you get it? This was bad. Real, real bad. It couldn't have been that bad. Dre, I'm not talking about that. I'm getting married. You're still married. And we--we just got busy. Where are my shoes? They're downstairs. Wait. Where you goin'? This is your spot. I need to get myself together. I have to meet kelby after the game. Wait. You're not gonna tell him, are you? What are you gonna tell him? Are you gonna tell him? I don't know. I--I--I-- no, I'm not. I'm not. I'm-- he doesn't know what happened and I want to keep it that way. Well, you're not gonna... Are you still gonna marry this cat after what we just had? Dre... What just happened was the most... Amazing... Most fulfilling... Most exhilarating... 5 minutes I've ever had in my life. 7. 10 minutes. 9? Ok, 8, whatever. The point is, what do we do now? We can't just go back to the way things were. Wait, wait. What are you saying? I need space. Us staying so close, spending so much time together, just confuses things for me right now. And besides, we wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for you catching Reese. Why are you talking like that? Why does it have to be all or nothing? Because we both know it's the right thing to do. [Music playing] [Overlapping conversations] [Sighs] Hey. [Overlapping conversations] I know you've done this mad times. I know you know what you're doing. But, you know, when you go in there, just, you know, be firm with them, you know what I'm sayin'? Yeah. Don't punk out like you did with Sidney. Just... You stand your ground. I never punk out with Sidney. You did. All I did was respect her wishes. Sound like some punk logic right there. How you figure? What about Francine? You were feeling her, right? Yeah. You ain't doin' nothin' about it. I'm not... The Humphrey bogart in this. I'm the Peter lorre. I'm the sidekick character. You the Humphrey bogart. You had your opening. You know what I'm saying? She wanted you to stop her from marrying the old dude, but you let it ride, you know? Same thing bogey did, man. You're the same dude. Man, don't be dissin' Humphrey bogart, man. Why not? 'Cause he's Humphrey bogart. He's the man. Yo, he was fightin' a war. That's what they did back then. You know what he needed to do back then? He needed to stop fine-ass Ingrid bergman from gettin' on the plane with the corny dude. And then, he gonna walk off in the fog with some other dude. Come on, man. With another dude, in the fog? Come on. 2 grown men walk off in a fog, you don't know where they goin'? Think about it, man. You smoke too much grass, man. I hope you don't think you walkin' off noplace with me, man. Matter of fact, let me sit over here. Don't fight it. I'm not here with him. I came by myself. I'm a solo artist. [Clears throat] I'm doin' my own thing. Security. Dj: A'ight, we got a new joint for y'all. I want you to check this out. New millennium recording artists ren and ten. Ten, rapping: ¶ hey, yo, ren ¶ ren: ¶ yo, what's up, ten? ¶ ¶ big c told me you was at the club ¶ ¶ pushin' up on one of my hos ¶ ¶ yo, yo, yo, yolanda? ¶ ¶ yeah, yolanda ¶ ¶ man, that ho is a ho ¶ ¶ you still mess with that? ¶ ¶ she may be a ho, but she's my ho, you know? ¶ [singing] ¶ the ho is mine ¶ ¶ you gotta get that bitch ¶ ¶ that ho is mine... ¶ Trish will see you now. ¶ I was first in line... ¶ wow. Wow. Ten and ren: ¶ mine ¶ wow. Trish: But not before. Come on, now. Thank you for your time, Trish. I'm from brown sugar records. As you know, I'm dre-- put it in. We'll know on the 17th. Uh-huh. Thursday. Not at 36, uh-uh. Yeah. Uh-huh. Thursday. Mm-hmm. Yeah. The 3:00 spot. [Dre's cd plays] Yeah, hold that thought. Can you leave me a couple more of those? And thanks for coming by. Go ahead. [Cd playing] Ok. Thank you for coming by. ¶ I can fix it up right quick... ¶ Trish: How many? [Laughing] ¶ Listen, y'all... ¶ I don't think so. Hey. What the hell is this? I said to give me space and then you pull this stuff? What-- what are you talkin' about? Guess what demo I heard for our unsigned underground review today. Are you serious? Dre, don't act like you didn't plan this. You know the editor does the unsigned reviews. Why would I need to plan? I could have just given it to you at any time. I was hoping it got the xxl 'cause the shit's tight, not 'cause I know you. Well, I'm not doing the review. I gave it to Gabe. Why'd you give it to Gabe? I gave you money to help start the label. Doesn't the conflict of interest seem obvious? [Groans] All right. Well, what did Gabe say? It wasn't a bad review. He dissed us. He didn't diss it. He just wasn't feelin' it. Sid, you gotta step in. You gotta do your thing. You're editor. I mean, you heard the cd. I can't do that, dre. I can't step on his review. You're the main person that's talkin' about hip-hop losin' its way, how we gotta get back to its roots. What's wrong with getting in touch with why we both fell in love with hip-hop in the first place? 'Cause it's about forward movement. Innovate and move on. One minute you talkin' about you want things to change, and the next minute you talking about you want things to stay the same. I do want things to change. I just don't like how things have changed. And--and I didn't know this is how it would turn out. And that's why we need to look back, ok? 'Cause if we look back, it will make us see things-- the mistakes we've made, things that we never knew were there before. And if we just can stop... Then maybe we can find that thing... That we both know is missing... And build on that. Are we... Are we still talking about hip-hop? That's all we've ever talked about. It's all we've ever known... From when we were 10. Sid, just do me a favor. Before you do something you might regret, just... Just listen again. Just listen again. And just follow your heart. And whatever you decide... Whatever you decide is cool. Whatever you decide is cool. Dre... Dre. I've made my decision. You ain't gonna change your mind? What about your heart, sid? Sid? Hey. Can I get you something, sir? Reese: Yes. Macallan 25, neat. Hey. Hey. You smell nice. Uh... You gonna have to treat me, 'cause I can't afford that shit no more. Here. Please. You couldn't afford it then, remember? I had to keep playing if I was gonna get your number. Damn. I lost nearly $200 that night. Yeah, yeah. Dre... [Sighs] So, what-- why'd you, uh... Why'd you call me here tonight? So we could have a drink, laugh on our good times, and, uh, act like none of this ever happened? Yes and no. I went to a divorce lawyer today. And... He asked me one simple question. Have we tried to make it work? Are you serious? Dre, let me finish. We never tried. We just assumed it was over, like we were in high school or something. But we're not. We're married. We took those vows, dre. You broke those vows. Come on. I know that you and Sidney have something very special that you share. I also know there's a reason you made me your wife. And I... And I'm hoping that whatever that reason is, it's enough to make you want to keep me as your wife. Oh, reesey. I do. I love you. But I think we both know that this can't work. I don't know if we have enough of... What it takes to... To make this last. I don't know if we ever had enough. We can't stay married. [Footsteps] Another round? Damn. Well... At least... Stay a while and have a few drinks and... Have a few laughs. I hope you realize this means that I have to take half of everything you have. Let me make it easy on you. Here's my little $58.25 now. Kelby... Sorry I'm late. I'm sorry. Well, we missed the show. I'm sorry. I just got caught in the middle of this tug-of-war between dre's label and xxl and... [Sighs] I don't know what to do. I feel so helpless. Kelby, we can see the show on Saturday. Yep. Will you wait up a second? How long are you two gonna play this game? What are you talking about? What am I talking about? You don't want to get married. I love you. But not the way you love him. I'm sorry. I don't know why your heart doesn't do what your mind tells it. You don't know. I'm sorry. ¶ Lying here ¶ ¶ how bad I feel ¶ ¶ the clock tick ¶ ¶ and I think of you... ¶ Sidney: I always thought, one day I would outgrow my relationship with hip-hop. ¶ Confusion ¶ ¶ is nothing new ¶ Sidney: I never thought it was a fad, like many. ¶ Flash back ¶ ¶ all night ¶ but I never thought it could grow and mature. ¶ Almost left behind ¶ ¶ suitcase ¶ ¶ of memories ¶ ¶ time after sometimes ¶ ¶ you picture me ¶ ¶ I'm walking ¶ ¶ too far ahead ¶ ¶ you're calling to me... ¶ Sidney: I thought it would be an adolescent memory I'd look back on, like a crush on the captain of the football team. But I realize we have more than that. Much more. We have a history... A friendship. We listen to each other. We laugh together. We finish each other's lyrics. I don't have to pretend with hip-hop, and hip-hop doesn't have to pretend with me. ¶ You will find me ¶ ¶ time after time ¶ Sidney: My feelings have never been more clear, and I know they will never go away. ¶ I'll be waiting ¶ to hip-hop. ¶ Time after time ¶ ¶ mmm mmm... ¶ wait. Didn't I already see you? Mm, yeah. So what are you doing back here? I know that y'all put a new song in rotation every week. So I figure I'm gonna show up every week till you take a serious listen to this cd. Then I'm gonna come back every week until you put this here cd into rotation. Every week. She say no. You playin'. Uh-uh. No, man. You're not playin'? I'm not playin', man. You for real? For real, man. Come here, boy! Yeah! Yeah, man. It's you, man. Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! We did it, man. You are the man! ¶ I worship at the temple of hip-hop ¶ ¶ attended service, Eric gave a sermon ¶ ¶ but the minister became intensely nervous ¶ ¶ when the killa priest went buck wild ¶ ¶ and made the reverend run ¶ ¶ I reached in... ¶ she said the Angie show, right? They still come on at the same time, right? Yes, man. Still thinking about Sidney, huh? Yeah, man. I told you you was a punk. Who you callin' punk? I know you be trippin'. Get your black ass-- now, let me tell you-- you better switch to that old crack, 'cause the new crack is killing you. Don't-- yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, what? They call me night train 'cause I'll put a nigga to sleep. Angie, on radio: We are happy to have you here, sid Shaw, editor of xxl magazine. What's been going on? Oh, it's been mad crazy, working on the magazine, and, uh... I just finished my book. Yay. Good. It's about hip-hop? It's my love letter to hip-hop. Sweet. What, uh, what's the name of it? It's called I used to love him. All right. Like the common joint? Mm-hmm. That's it. The classic common joint, which, actually, we should play right now, since we're talkin' about that. It's a perfect opportunity to do that. Let's do this. It's my joint right here, too. I love it. Um, you want to dedicate it to anybody? Yeah. Um... I would, uh, like to dedicate this song, like I dedicated my book, to hip-hop. I used to love you. I still do. And always will. You better go get her, Humphrey. Common: ¶ what I love most, she has so much soul ¶ ¶ she was old school when I was just a shorty ¶ ¶ never knew throughout my life she would be there for me ¶ it's hot 97, blazin' hip-hop and R&B. Angie mart, sid Shaw in the place, xxl. And, uh, we should get back to the phones. Ok. Ok. Let some people holler at you. Let's go to 5. Where you from? Dre: Uh, the boogie down-- South Bronx-- and I'm here to set the record straight. So, um, I got a question for--for Sidney Shaw. Ok. Uh, Sidney Shaw, when did you fall in love with hip-hop? When I heard kangol crew and get fresh crew. Well, I don't think you understood the question, so I'm gonna ask you again. Sid... When did you fall in love... With hip-hop? [Knock on glass] [Mouthing] Talk to him. Dre... I've been in love with you from the first day I saw you. [Sighs, whispers] Thank you. All right, I got a-- I got a follow-up question. Uh, why'd it take you so long to say that? 'Cause I was scared. And hardheaded. [Whispers] And stupid. [Chuckles] Real hardheaded. So, I'm listening to hot 97 'cause I hear--hey-- no. Shh! I hear that they about to play cavi's first single. So I'm like "yo." This is a big-- down here? A big day for brown sugar records. Big things is going down, sid. Just like you said it would. And I couldn't be more unhappy because for the first time since... I can remember... I didn't have you to share my life with. Sidney... I have loved you from the first time I laid eyes on you. And I love you still. You're my air. So, I don't want to be your friend no more. There we go. They need to get a room. They probably will. I found out some more stuff about those, uh, those champagne flutes. They call 'em champagne flutes because, you know, they're all long and narrow like, you know, like woodwind instruments, like, uh, you know, like a-- flute. Right. That's right-- the whole flute thing is in there, and, uh-- and the queen of France Marie antoinette-- I don't know if you know her-- but, um, you know, she didn't like the regular common glasses, so she had them make, uh, glasses that looked like her, uh--uh--eh, you know, like her upper body.
