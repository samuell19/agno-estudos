[crew laughing] WRIGHT: Sparks-- how did this glam rock anomaly become a band with a career spanning five decades?

And where does one even start with 25 studio albums and nearly 500 songs? Join us as we pull back the curtain to shine a light on the brothers Mael and crucially offer a window into the psyche of these extraordinary musicians and, through their music, paint a long overdue portrait of them as real artists.

I'm still not convinced that they're American. JOHN CONGLETON: I always sort of thought of them as like Cheap Trick in a way, like, oh, they're probably from the Midwest somewhere. RON: We're kind of the rare breed of native-born Californians. RUSSELL: I was born in Santa Monica, California. He was born in Culver City, California. Our father was an artist, a painter and was also a commercial artist for theHollywood Citizen-News. ♪ Well, I saw Uncle John... RON: Some of the images that he painted were places that we would go to quite a bit. One of them was the Santa Monica Pier. We would spend days fishing for perch. And kind of-- the pier, to me, looks like that painting, not like the real thing is. ♪ Have some fun tonight... RUSSELL: He always had these records from Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis and Little Richard.

I remember the first time I went to see Blackboard Jungle. One instance of hearing the title music changed my whole DNA. This kind of music was really overturning that staid Eisenhower-era lifestyle. This was wrong but in all the kind of right ways. KAPRANOS: If you want to understand Ron and Russell, you need to see them through one prism, and that-that prism is cinema but specifically Hollywood. RON: I remember spending a lot of time at the movies with Russell and our father. We would go see a lot of Westerns and war films. I really cherished those Saturday matinees. It was a rich experience. It was more than just a movie. It was a... a total afternoon with popcorn and cartoons and newsreels. Why don't you try a juicy, good hot dog? Our parents didn't care if a movie had started, so we would just come in the middle of the movie and try to imagine what the beginning of it was. And I think part of our, uh, jagged sense of narrative in the songs might have been, uh, initiated in some way by that. ♪ RUSSELL: Um, when our father died, uh, obviously, it was a really traumatic experience. You don't even understand, really, how that's possible or that he's not gonna ever be there again. And-and, uh, it's something that's so abstract, just the concept of death. And, uh... and it's when... when it's your father, and then especially at that age, too, that you're so young that you never got to ask the questions that you would now like to have asked to him and to have known more about him. And I think that's kind of part of the sad thing, too, is that, uh, so much you'll never find out about, uh, your own father. RON: We were both very, very young. I was... I was 11, and Russell was eight, and... kind of everything changed at that moment for us, and I think it did bring us closer together. RUSSELL: 'Cause it was all very unexpected, the three of us were then kind of forced to be stronger as a unit. Um, Ron and I would, you know, do everything that we could to help out our mom. RON: Our mother decided that I should have piano lessons. I didn't want to admit that I enjoyed taking the piano lessons because, you know, there... always a rebellious streak in me, but piano lessons were actually something I really enjoyed. And they would have talent shows at elementary school, and I would get up there in a pink sport jacket and a... a tie, and my hair really kind of greased and everything, and performing those talent shows was an addictive thing.

You would always want to go see any British band that would come to Los Angeles. The high point of our lives-- uh, we can actually say we've seen The Beatles twice because we had a cool mom. ANNOUNCER: The Beatles, on their way to the Hollywood Bowl. Some of the youngsters don't give up easily. RUSSELL: For whatever reason, she agreed to drive us to Las Vegas, where they were playing a concert. So there we were in our little Fiat Multipla that our mom had and had this sort of bad futuristic shape to it. And, uh, we're putting along the highway to Las Vegas just to see The Beatles. That's a mom. ["Happenings Ten Years Time Ago" by The Yardbirds playing] RON: While we were at UCLA, everything coalesced for us as far as soaking in all of these things from the outside. RUSSELL: We played in bands early on with ridiculous names. I don't know, we were in Moonbaker Abbey, and we were in The Urban Renewal Project. I mean, how successful could a band ever get calling themselves Urban Renewal Project? RON: The first two songs that we ever recorded were "Computer Girl" and, uh, the other one-- what was this? -What was the second one? -RUSSELL: "Windmill." I'm ashamed that I forgot that, but "W-Windmill." -So classic that he forgot it. -Yeah. RON: It's really strange to have a song in 1966 called "Computer Girl," because we didn't even really know what a computer was at that time. ♪ Computer girl ♪ My computer girl ♪ This is a recording ♪ She's got no arms ♪ She's got no legs ♪ For computers ♪ Have no limbs... -WRIGHT: Pre-Kraftwerk? -RON: Pre-Kraftwerk. Yes. RUSSELL: Yeah, we predate Kraftwerk when it comes to computer songs. RON: The first time that we really got serious about music was when we met Earle Mankey and the three of us got together and had similar musical taste. EARLE MANKEY: They seemed pretty much just like normal college students. But once we got into the recording process, they-they turned out to be different. You have three people in a room and a two-track tape recorder, and you want to emulate, let's say The Beatles. Well, uh, first, you might think you need drums. Well, we didn't have any drums. So, uh, bang on some boxes and find a table that had a nice tone, and if you needed a cymbal, that was harder. But as I recall, there was a brass lampshade that, uh, didn't really ring like a cymbal, but it would give us a nice clank. HARLEY FEINSTEIN: When I joined the band, it was called Halfnelson. I was contacted by Russell, and he explained to me, "Well, we're not just getting together "to drink beer, meet girls and play music. We're actually gonna become big." That sounds like the scene from our biopic that's, uh, upcoming soon. ♪ Whoo! ♪ Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa, fa-fa-fa... ♪ RUSSELL: I think, at the beginning, I was trying to be as much like Mick Jagger or Roger Daltrey as I could possibly be.

And I remember one time I made the comment that, "Hey, Blood Sweat & Tears, they're great, huh?" All the eyes rolled back simultaneously. It could've been worse.

["When You're a French Director" by Sparks playing] ♪ When you're a French director... ♪ RON: There was a sense at the time that if you were kind of a hip person that you would also automatically be interested in French New Wave films and Bergman. It kind of went hand in hand with liking the British bands. It was just kind of a badge of honor, liking nonmainstream things. LARRY DUPONT: When I first met Ron, we were all deeply, deeply rooted in film. As far as Russ was concerned, uh, he wanted to be a filmmaker. Early on, I was dabbling in French New Wave cinema and, uh, made a film when I was at UCLA. Um, and I don't know if it's... I-I wouldn't call it a great film, -but it wasn't... -Oh, don't be so modest. MANKEY: I starred in Russell's student film, Très Sérieux, which means, I guess, Very Serious or something like that. My name in the movie was Jean-Paul Mankey. You know, it was poking fun at, uh, French art films. That's the cool thing about them. You know, they take something that seems to be really great and arty, and then they shoot it in the pants. Other times, people think they're making fun of something when they're deadly serious. [laughing]: They're kind of inscrutable, those guys. MIKE BERNS: Well, I had a chance to meet Ron and Russell when I worked at, uh, Universal Records. They brought their demo tape in, and I was taken by the creativity, the artistry, uh, the individuality. And it was something that you just knew was something. And I lobbied my brains out to have them get signed. MANKEY: Every office we'd go into was all excited. They'd call their friends in and say, "Listen to this stuff. Isn't this weird? Isn't this great?" Uh, and then they wouldn't sign us. DUPONT: The thing that marked them was their unwillingness to give up on rejection. They just wouldn't give up. RUSSELL: There's always just been one person throughout our whole career that would kind of get what it was that we were doing at any one particular time-- and the first one was Todd Rundgren-- when everybody else at every record label rejected us. If it hadn't been for him, there wouldn't have been a Sparks now. RUNDGREN: Well, without me, there would be no Halfnelson. Sparks was something that happened a little later. ANNOUNCER: Todd Rundgren first discovered Sparks and produced their debut album. BERNS: We sent the demo album to Todd Rundgren. I had some notoriety in the business, so he took my call. My memory was that, uh, Russell's, uh, girlfriend, part-time girlfriend, girlfriend on and off, uh, was Miss Christine from the GTO's. Miss Christine was like my girlfriend for a while, and then she became Russell's girlfriend for a while. RUSSELL: We became friends with-with, uh, Miss Christine as well. And so, um, at that time, I, uh... -We did? -[laughing]: We did. We did. -[crew laughing] -[Russell clears throat] Let me... let me, uh... yeah, we were... So I became... I became friends with Miss Christine. I think Russell thought it was weird, but I didn't consider it any sort of affront, but I think I knew Miss Christine better than he did. PAMELA DES BARRES: Yeah, I'm sure Miss Christine played Todd the demo. She was... she and Todd were together quite a while, um, and she loved Sparks. MANKEY: Christine said, "Oh, Todd, "you've got to hear these guys. It's so great. You're gonna want to sign 'em." RUNDGREN: I was struck by the fact that it wasn't like anything else that I was normally getting. It is sometimes like butterfly hunting. You're looking for some species that nobody has ever discovered before. So they set up a demo as if it was like a whole venue. They had this rehearsal space out in the Valley. They called it the Doggy Factory, which implied that doggies were made there, but it was actually doggy beds. [chuckles] JAMES LOWE: Yeah, that's... it was all left-handed. It was... I mean, this band, you're gonna go see 'em at a doggy bed factory. I thought they were joking. I thought it was a club. RUNDGREN: We all sat down in some folding chairs, and they put on a whole show. MANKEY: The biggest number, uh, I guess it would have to be the song "Slowboat." There was a papier-mâché boat. Russell would sit in this boat and be towed across the floor by the roadie. RUSSELL: I got in it as if it was like a Rose Parade float, and I was waving to the audience as the captain of this slow boat. MANKEY: And about three feet later, he'd have to stop because it would be the end of the stage. LOWE: My wife thought Russ was, uh, very cute, and I kept asking her about the music, but she kept telling me how cute Russ was. Russ was really cute. [laughs] RUNDGREN: I was well proud of the effort that they put out and said, "We'll make a record." ♪ Slow boat, bring me back another day... ♪ Of course, everything that happened after that was... was evolutionary. ♪ -[song ends] -[crowd cheering] [indistinct radio chatter] MAN: Sorry, Sam, can we take that back a little ways? We'll pick it up. RUSSELL: We really were elated that now things seemed real for once. FEINSTEIN: It was really amazing. It was really surreal. It was like, "My God, this is... How did I get here? This is incredible." RUSSELL: It just, uh, seemed like we were soon gonna be at the Hollywood Bowl ourselves. FEINSTEIN: The making of the album was so much fun. It was great. Uh, we had what seemed like an unlimited amount of time in a good studio. ♪ All will join in ♪ In the big scene... ♪ RON: To Todd's credit, he really made us feel at home and more importantly made us feel at home musically because he really wanted us to keep to the essence of what the demos were. ♪ Take a tall one, take a small one... ♪ RUNDGREN: I didn't want to mess with this latent outsider genius. I'm just gonna figure out how to make it a little bit more high-fidelity, and that... [laughs] and that will be fine, I think. FEINSTEIN: This album was gonna be just phenomenal, just really good. RUSSELL: We released the Halfnelson album, and it didn't really get the commercial success that I think Todd was hoping for. KAPRANOS: With Sparks, you have this strange combination of... almost creative recklessness because they don't follow the conventional path, which is what makes them great as a fan. There's this force of creativity that goes into that experimentation, but the culture isn't there yet. And then you find yourself in the real world where you have to sell records. Well, you did it again. JACK ANTONOFF: You look at Sparks, they're-they're just blazing this trail, um, because there's just no... It-It's the ultimate experience of what you want from your artists. There's just no connection to what is actually going on in the world. FEINSTEIN: The album didn't sell very well, so the, uh, marketing geniuses at the record company said, "Well, maybe a different name and a different album cover would make the difference." And he goes, "You guys like comedy. You like the Marx Brothers. You're brothers. So the Sparks Brothers." And that met with one of those pregnant pauses from us where we both stare at-at him, uh, kind of aghast. FEINSTEIN: I think we negotiated out the word "brothers" and ended up with just Sparks.

So the thing that happened is the band went far afield. MANKEY: It's just ridiculous. We played some just terrible places where they all hated us. [laughs] DUPONT: They went to Redding, California. It's like, why the hell Redding? But Houston got off to a bad start and went downhill. FEINSTEIN: So, there we are playing for this redneck audience that had been there to come see a band called Cold Blood. Needless to say, uh, they did not like us very much. RUSSELL: I used to, as part of the stage act, have this giant wooden sledgehammer, with this, like, really heavy mallet on it. MANKEY: He'd throw the sledgehammer up in the air and catch it, but this time, he didn't catch it. Came down-- slam!-- on his head. And I won't say it knocked him out, but he was extremely bloody. RUSSELL: And I had this giant gash on my head, and I'm bleeding and blood's flowing down. But the audience seemed to think it was part of our show, like it was... you know, it was Alice Cooper with a blood capsule, but this was no blood capsule. This was my kind of brain, uh, oozing out onto the stage. We're all laughing up until we see Ron's reaction. And Ron's reaction is a combination of, "How dare you laugh?" and, "Oh, my God, Russ is gonna die." FEINSTEIN: I didn't even know he hit himself in the head until after it was over. Then we went backstage, and I saw he was bleeding, and big brother Ron, of course, was very concerned. -Was I? -WRIGHT: Yeah. -Oh, times change. -[laughter] RUSSELL: The next album that we would come up with, which was called Woofer in Tweeter's Clothing, was produced by Jim Lowe. LOWE: They were what I thought rock and roll was supposed to be. And I thought, "If this doesn't happen, what am I gonna go do next?" What would you produce after you did Sparks? MANKEY: The fact that the second album was more experimental than the first album, I think, was just a natural progression. It might have been better. It was certainly more complex, more artistic. I thought that made for a more interesting album. RON: In a way, that album is even more eccentric, I think, than... than the first album. And so, you know, it was really inspiring to us to know that they were giving us this permission to kind of commit self-destruction. [tires squealing] ♪ Whippings and apologies... LOWE: Those two records are my two favorite records that I've been involved with. And I told my wife after the Wooferalbum, I said, "If this album doesn't... "doesn't make some noise or do something, I'm gonna go into another business." It was just, "I-I don't know anything about music. If people don't like this stuff, it's crazy." And so I started, uh, directing television commercials. [laughter] RUNDGREN: It didn't create the spark that they... [laughs] that they had hoped for. RUSSELL: They said, "Well, it's not really "clicking here in the States, but the sensibility "seems to be something that we think would go over better in the UK." And all of a sudden, one day, we're on a frigging airplane to London.

FEINSTEIN: Back in the Doggy Factory, we had a picture on the wall of John's Children, and they were really cool-looking guys. When we got over there, John was our manager.

That was actually a-a real turn-on because whatever Bob didn't like, you kind of liked. Great stuff. Everybody saw us on Old Grey Whistle Test, and being on the telly was a big deal. So, when we then got the follow-up gig at the Marquee Club, the place was packed. MORLEY: Almost in that first moment, when you see something like Sparks, which is just so distinctive and sounds so distinctive, everything that you ever feel about them for the rest of time is in there. ♪ Oh, my word, she's from Germany ♪ ♪ Well, it's the same old country ♪ ♪ But the people have changed... ♪ RON: "Girl from Germany" was kind of a harbinger of things to come for us in a lyrical way, I think.

"We're gonna pull the plug, and we're gonna bring 'em back to America." DUPONT: They literally were thrown out of England. It was like one day's notice, you're on an airplane, you're out of here. "Pack your gear and get out of here." FEINSTEIN: We had built up way more momentum in London than we had in L.A., but whatever momentum we had built up in L.A. had completely died out. My memory of what the mood was like at that time was, "Well, you know, this thing may have run its course." ["Do-Re-Mi" by Sparks playing] RON: We were kind of stuck in a way, knowing that there was this promised land that was... that was there for us if we could only figure out how to get there. HEWLETT: They called and said they'd like to come over and, um, yeah, could I help? Which I could and did. I talked to David Betteridge at Island Records, and David said, "Yeah, go for it." [cheering] As soon as I saw the pictures of Ron and Russell-- this was before I'd met them-- just looking at the pictures and listening to those first two albums, straightaway, it all made sense. It seemed to me that the only way that we could get this happening is if we made it a little bit more rock and roll and get an English backing group with them. FEINSTEIN: A friend of mine said, "I saw your old band buddies. "They're having a garage sale. And they told me that they were moving to England." And I said, "What? They're moving to England? News to me." RON: A yard sale in anybody's yard in Los Angeles means bad news for somebody. It was an agonizing decision for Ron and Russ to-to, uh, cut the band loose and go to England. RON: To betray the other people was a really difficult thing, but also knowing that being a British band was a lifetime dream of ours. FEINSTEIN: They were on the horns of a dilemma. Obviously, I think they made the right decision. The rest is history. [bells chiming] RUSSELL: The bands that we had admired, these English bands that we liked so much, we always thought of them as being glamorous and-and bigger than life. So, when we put out these ads for band members, we were kind of trying to find people that would fulfill that image of ours of this England that was maybe just in our minds. WINWOOD: Straightaway, it worked. It just worked. HEWLETT: Each time you'd go to the rehearsal room, there'd be something new there. I'm like, "Shit, that's good." Um, you know, then the next rehearsal. "Wow, that song's good." WINWOOD: We found a momentum very quickly, and when we got enough tracks to make an album, then we said, "We've made an album." RUSSELL: Well, everybody at Island was really ecstatic about the album and really supportive. And-and especially in picking "This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us" to be the first song, 'cause it was... you know, it was taking a chance, it was going for something that was really extreme. TONY VISCONTI: "This Town Ain't Big Enough for the Both of Us" was the first record I heard by them on the radio. I remember I-I had a, uh... a darkroom in my home, and that came on in the dark. I nearly dropped my tongs, as they say in the photography world. VINCE CLARKE: The first thing that I ever bought was, um, "This Town Ain't Big Enough for the Both of Us."

He was taken aback a bit that I was an American, and he went and made a phone call and had taken us off the show because we hadn't gotten work permits. -So everyone at Island was just distraught.-[screaming] It allowed another band, one of the greats of all time, The Rubettes, to take our place, and so they sadly reached number one.

MORLEY: The next day, when you talk about it, the word of mouth begins in a way that is viral-- like we now have, obviously, on everything-- but back then, that was a rare thing. And you start to make things up slightly. One of my favorite anecdotes about thatTop of the Pops appearance is... is John Lennon ringing up Ringo Starr and saying... -You won't believe what's on the television. -What? -Marc Bolan is playing a song with Adolf Hitler. -Hitler? MORLEY: But that's how, unfortunately, we all thought. We all thought Adolf Hitler. SHELLEY WINTERS: Two years ago, there was somebody dressed like Hitler playing the piano on the BBC. Sparks. She's talking about Sparks. He-he was born looking like Hitler, that guy. [laughter] MORLEY: From then on, every single piece ever written about the group would just say "Adolf Hitler," which also really kind of weirdly tangled up in the myth of the group. You know, the shock to the system as a piece of choreography, let alone his appearance, was so remarkable that immediately it started to grow in your imagination.

They would have been more objectified. They're doing-- even with the visual, they're doing something interesting, but you can't quite put your finger on what it is. MYERS: I was like, "Oh, my God, this is fantastic." At once like fashion photography, and at once making fun of fashion photography. And I think that is something I love about Sparks is that they are the ones they were to mock, you know, in a weird way. TAYLOR: The art direction's just superb.

Oh, God, there I am, yeah. -[Coble laughs] -[raucous cheering] MARCUS: Obviously, Russell was beautiful, but I always loved Ron. He was different. He was a little bit more challenging.

It was kind of inspirational to us. HEWLETT: Ron and Russell always had a desire to write music in movies, and they love movies and wanted to be a part of movies. RON: In the '70s, one of our favorite filmmakers was Jacques Tati. Tati, at that time, was looking to expand his audience to younger people, and somehow he thought that maybe connecting with a band would be a way for him to broaden the appeal of his films.

If you want to just absorb it, you're going to be missing the point entirely. That's what hurt them, I think. It hurt Sparks that they came of age at a time when people could only take things at face value. One of the snottier metal/punk magazines, the review was:"Introducing Sparks, dot-dot-dot. Unfortunately, we've already met." HEWLETT: From the adulation that they had been receiving to the non-adulation around Big Beatand Introducing, it was just obvious it wasn't working.

And, of course, he did Ron. I mean, I know how much Ron and Russell are fans of The Beatles, and so I suspect they were really excited to see that. SCHWARTZMAN: That's amazing, like, that a Beatle would pretend to be all these... like, Buddy Holly and all these different people, and he's Ron Mael. RUSSELL: I started respecting Ron a lot more after Paul McCartney, uh, gave his tribute to Ron-- then I realized, "God, I'm working with somebody that Paul McCartney likes." FRED ARMISEN: How cool is that? It is the ultimate. And it's Paul McCartney. Just incredible. RON: After doingNo. 1 in Heaven and working with Giorgio Moroder, which was such an inspiring experience, it was the time for the follow-up album, but Giorgio wasn't, uh, available, so it was kind of farmed out. I think, for that reason, the album became more generic. To Giorgio's credit, he was involved with the selection, and there was the song "When I'm with You." He thought that that song was really something special. ["When I'm with You" by Sparks playing] EGAN: "When I'm with You." [imitates bass line] That bass line, that beautiful string line. It wasn't anything that we kind of planned on, but it became, uh, the biggest-selling song that we've ever done. ♪ When I'm with you ♪ I never have a problem ♪ When I'm with you... RON: Most of those sales were in France, and the song was kind of the soundtrack of the country during that whole period. "When I'm with You," the Sparks. ♪ When I'm with you...

He's playing a character, and then the... and you kind of work out what the character's biography is. Each song has such a personality to it. That middle eight is the thing that I think, for some listeners who might be investing in, like, a love song, will say, like, "Oh, hold up. Is this a joke?" It could be seen as being insincere. In reality, it's the thing that makes them more memorable. [cheering and applause] RUSSELL: The thing of doing TV shows that we did in a period of, like, "When I'm with You" in France-- and we did a lot in Germany at that time-- I think, you know, we realized that the appeal of Sparks was going to an area that wasn't where we wanted to be going. And so, um, that was why we wanted to start having a band context again. Please, uh, can you smile? Uh, cheese. Ah. [speaks French] -Merci. Thank you. -[applause] [continues in French] BOHEM: My relationship to Sparks, like most everything else, is based on coffee. I am an avid, to this day, coffee drinker. And in 1980, it was pretty rough. The one place you could go in Los Angeles was the Farmers Market. They had a Belgian waffle stand with one espresso machine. RODDY BOTTUM: People started to say, "I saw the Sparks brothers at Farmers Market." And we're like, "What?" -Small soy cappuccino, please. -And for you? Uh, what's a red-eye? So, a coffee with a shot of espresso. -Really? -Yeah, double caffeine. -Wow. I'll try that. -You want one? -Yeah. Yeah. -Small? I'll... I hope I live to tell the tale. BOHEM: I started noticing Ron and Russell at this other table. They were there almost every day that we were there, and then after a while, we-we started saying sort of a grudging hello to each other. RUSSELL: One thing led to the next, and we, uh, poached their entire band, and, uh, that was the end of Bates Motel. But it was the start of the '80s version of Sparks. BOHEM: We went to S.I.R.-- Studio Instrument Rentals-- on Santa Monica and we started rehearsing the songs for what eventually was Whomp That Sucker. KENDRICK: It was very different thanTerminal Jive. It was like, this is a new thing going on. I want to say we rehearsed for six weeks, and then we were on a plane to Munich and-and recording the album. ♪ And, boy, am I sorry... All of a sudden, we're in Musicland Studios. It's Giorgio Moroder's studio. It's in the basement of this groovy hotel. RON: Sometimes, we just kind of drift into things, but that really was a conscious decision to work with a band. KENDRICK: They were inseparable. At that time, I kind of had this thing. They were almost like a symbiotic thing. They were like one sort of complete form. You know, it's an interesting thing about how they wrote at that time that the lyrics came last. Russell would kind of do, like, nonsense verbiage just to fill in the space. It was kind of incredible. Ron would furiously finish the lyrics, literally, it seemed like, the night before. The lyrics would show up, and we'd go, "Wow, I had no idea."

RON: The radio station that really mattered was "K-Rock," KROQ, and they were playing a lot of things that just fit into our style. ["Don't Go" by Yazoo playing] I never knew Ron and Russell to ever make a calculated move to capture an audience. Sometimes they hit it because they liked something everybody else liked. KROQ played all the-the weird stuff coming from England: The Cure, Depeche Mode, Duran Duran, New Order. SHERMAN-PALLADINO: If you listened to KROQ, you generally didn't listen to other stations. Like, it was sort of like you just listened to KROQ. KNEGO: I remember just falling out of my chair, you know, hearing Sparks actually on the radio. BOHEM: You know, we're in Munich, and somebody's calling, like, "Hey they're playing 'Tips for Teens' on KROQ every 15 minutes." I'm like, "Can we hear it?" [laughs]: You know? Sparks is extraordinarily popular in Europe. You are very popular in this country, but I think it's safe to say that perhaps you-your reception over there is wilder and more, uh, outgoing than it is here. What are you doing to correct that situation? We're gonna be concentrating really heavily on the States in the next year. DICK CLARK: Would you introduce me to your associates, please? RUSSELL: On bass, Les Bohem. BOHEM: I thinkWhomp That Sucker is the Bates Motel backup band, andAngst, that is the point where we were a band. STEWART: Angst in My Pants is a record where culture and zeitgeist all come together in that record. We have Ron and Russell. Who is the older? You are. [laughter] RICHARDSON: First of all, best cover. That cover totally rules. This is how you do an album cover. DJ LANCE ROCK: I just remember looking at that, and it's like, there's this guy in a wedding dress with this, you know, weird mustache. It was just such a striking image. Even now, it is. STEWART: They themselves are heterosexual, but they had a huge gay following. Their songs questioned notions of masculinity. They did it in their music, they did it in their videos, and I think they did it on that album cover. I mean, that is in the great rock and roll tradition of: "'F' you, America." You know, it's-it's disturbing, it's unsettling. It's not right. It's not Republican. It's not apple pie. MADELINE BOCCHIARO: Some dudes wouldn't even buy the album, 'cause they didn't want to bring it to the counter, but that's their problem. RON: We think it's important to do something that is polarizing. We don't feel bad about that in-in the slightest. It kind of encourages us to... to push what we're doing even more. ["I Predict" by Sparks playing] ♪ You're gonna take a walk in the rain ♪ ♪ And you're gonna get wet ♪ I predict... It's probably one of the most macho, badass Sparks songs that's out there.

Certainly very distracting. FLEA: Yeah, it's shtick and it's showbiz, but it's also emblematic and symbolic of what their true essence of who they are is. BOTTUM: Who is the star of Sparks? Sometimes it's Ron, sometimes it's Russell. Russell is, like, a sort of traditional singer, but Ron was... yeah, really shined as just this sort of strange, odd presence. Thank you. Thank you. Tell us, though, about Sparks. I know that you're an underground band. What-what are you saying to those kids out there or to adults? What-what is Sparks saying? Sparks is a rock band with a point of view. The thing that we wish to convey is-is a sense of joy about the music that we are creating. And I think most of this sense of joy is from Russell's singing and from my lyrical approach. Sometimes it's satirical but never without some sort of witty point of view. -HOST: Sparks. -[cheering] DJ LANCE ROCK: "Cool Places" is a big hit. I think that's the first time some of my contemporaries became aware of Sparks. -Our time has come. -Okay. -And here we are. -We've arrived.

When we saw Molly Ringwald doing it, we were like, "Oh, my God, she stole our dance." ♪ I wanna go, I wanna go... How did you fall in with this company? -We met on a love boat cruise. -[laughs] No, no, seriously. How did the... Did you get a telephone call? Did you see her? What... Who made the first call? Oh, it was mutual admiration for, uh, each other's respective groups and then mutual, uh, admiration for each other's bodies. -[laughter] -Would you stop that? I knew, if I let you go long enough, I'd be in trouble. WIEDLIN: As you can imagine, I was madly in love with Russell all through my teenage-hood, and then I got to meet him, and I basically threw myself at him. Let's just put it that way. And, um... so we had sort of this brief, brief romance that, uh, didn't ever really get deep or anything, and it was fun, and I think, really, a lot of it for me was getting to fulfill a fantasy. You know, one thing led to the next, you know. You're now getting a little insight into how things happen in the music world. You think it's all just kind of-- people come out with albums and record and it's all lovey-dovey. You know, this... this is how... We thought it was limos and ludes, but it's really sex, huh? -This is how it happens, yes. -It's really sex. WIEDLIN: I was so in love with Russell 'cause he was so cute, so I chose beauty over brains, but... and I'm not saying Russell's not smart or Ron's not beautiful-- don't get me wrong-- but, like, now, like, I think of Ron, and I'm like... [swooning]: "Oh, Ron Mael." Like, I mean, he just wrote some of my favorite songs I've ever heard. ["I Wish I Looked a Little Better" by Sparks playing] KAPRANOS: There is this continual theme through Ron's lyrics in Sparks songs of somehow not being good enough. VERA HEGARTY: Sparks do that thing-- it's like, they have a really poignant theme, and they're addressing something quite serious, but it's done in a kind of a playful, slightly throwaway way.

JONES: It didn't occur to me, but being brothers, at the time, when he was the cutie-pie and all the teenagers loved him, did he get jealous that he wasn't getting any attention? I mean, that would've done me in if I was his brother. CONGLETON: He's celebrating all the things that awkward kids feel.

Ladies and gentlemen, Sparks. -[applause] -["Change" playing] WIEDLIN: They just keep doing it, and they never let anything stop them. Whether they're popular or not popular, it just doesn't seem to matter to them, and I love that about them. ROSS: They don't want to stick with just one thing. You know, and what an audience seems to want is: "This is what this band does, and this is what they'll continue doing for me." And if you change too much, I think it upsets people, but in their case, they needed to. And I kind of love them all the more for that. ♪ The rain is falling down...

Unfortunately, at that time, they had less relevance than they ever had to what was going on in the market. So we got to put the record out, but we weren't able to do much for it. KNEGO: You know, they weren't, like, 20-somethings anymore. It was a very, very hard time commercially for them, but creatively, they never stopped. They were always working on something. Is there anybody out there at all right now? DICK CLARK: Let's take a look and see what's going on out there in California. They're bringing it in in style. HAYDON: They recorded every day, sometimes seven days a week. They were in their home studio just coming up with brilliant material that wasn't being signed, and it wasn't necessarily going to culminate into an album. CLARK: 1990. Happy New Year! HAYDON: Because of the lack of a record deal and any kind of record company financial support, you know, there comes a point where the well is getting a bit dry. It seemed, like, really imperative that Russell learn how to be the engineer. CLARK: It's 1991 onNew Year's Rockin' Eve. HAYDON: Had they have been two guys that did drugs and all of that and blew their money in the past, they wouldn't have been able to pay their bills during that time. It's a testament to them in every aspect, you know, to how they had... had, um, you know, saved for that rainy day. So they were able to have, you know, almost six years of rainy days. CLARK: Now, 1992. Happy New Year. HAYDON [crying]: Like, I get emotional when I think about that time. Every day-- like I said, sometimes seven days a week... ...from morning till night, they were working so hard. And they never... they never tried to, you know, do their version of being commercial. They never tried to... to dumb it down, water it down. They stayed so true to exactly... what they've always been. CLARK: Five seconds to 1993. Happy New Year's Rockin' Eve '93. RUSSELL: The one thing that I'm proudest of with Sparks is just our determination and resilience. For instance, we devoted six years of our lives to work on a movie musical project that was called Mai, the Psychic Girl. It was based on a Japanese manga. We were really up for the challenge of that because we-we thought that this could be a way also for Sparks to channel what we were doing but in another form yet again. And Tim Burton was signed on early on to direct it. We did miss performing live during that period, but I think, in the back of our heads, we were also thinking a lot of people are gonna see this Tim Burton movie and it will obviously help the cause for Sparks. HAYDON: When we got word that Tim was bowing out of Mai, the Psychic Girl, there were tears, and... [chuckles] And I-I-I cry easily, but Ron and Russell don't, and there were tears. RON: We kind of had put all of our chips on that one thing, and-and maybe that was the wrong thing to do. RUSSELL: Somehow, you know, you muster up the enthusiasm to-to continue on. I think sometimes it's the setbacks that-that actually make you stronger. And sometimes, as a result of those things, you end up doing something even better. CLARK: Happy 1994.

Backstage at a Pet Shop Boys concert, while I was promoting their records, I approached Neil Tennant, and I said, "Why don't you guys ever acknowledge Sparks?" And he just gave me a, you know, sort of a scornful look and said, "You're very naughty," and walked away. MORRIS: It was weird coming back... GILBERT: Yeah. ...to find something you invented. [laughing]: Yeah. And you've left behind. KNEGO: We had a top ten with "When Do I Get to Sing 'My Way'" and another couple charting singles off of that album as well. So Sparks really sort of made a name for themselves in the clubs, which was really cool. RON: It became the number one airplay song in Germany.

KNEGO: They weren't trying to be something to please a record company. They were just taking all their creative juices and putting it into something that they loved. It's that ability and desire to take risks and to mess things up that makes them Sparks. RUSSELL: I think we spent over a year recordingLil' Beethoven, not even knowing for sure what the end product was going to be. And I think, when you kind of approach an album in that sort of way, we tend to spend a lot of time on it. It's you. RON: The albumLil' Beethoven, in particular, was one where the studio was essential. Just creatively, you know, we feel so energized by working in this kind of way where we don't have to feel foolish if we do something foolish. And we do quite a bit of foolish things, but you'll never hear about 'em. RUSSELL: Not being dependent on massive budgets and record companies became a really liberating thing that now we could record on our own, and then we just hand that off to a... to a label, and then, uh, take it or leave it.

You know, what would be the concept? And it was just a really sort of seemingly stupid idea-- what if you perform every album followed by the new album? RON: Sue Harris came up with the idea to do 21 of our albums-- the entire catalog-- one each night live. By our nature, we said, "Sounds great." And then we realized the enormity of the task. ♪ STEVIE NISTOR: Russell said, "We're thinking about playing every song we've ever written night after night in London. What do you think?" And I just laughed. It's just impossible. And Ron said, "We're even gonna do the B-sides for the encores." And I said, "How many songs is that?"

Well, now it's time to start rehearsing the second record. Okay, well, here's a new thing. It's starting to sound good by the end of the week.

RHODES: Let's face it, you got to be completely crazy to do 21 shows in a row with a different album every single night. It's insane, but it's fantastic. Number one! Number two. Number three. ROSS: They treated every single one of their albums with the same level of respect and the same attention to detail, regardless of how well it did commercially or critically at the time. ♪ I'm just likable night and day... ♪ HARRIS: So it went on for a month. But it was fun. It was just exhausting. I think everyone lost a stone in weight in the first week and couldn't eat. It was nerve-racking. ♪ Ah... NISTOR: It was hard. Any time I was feeling sorry for myself, I would look at Ron doing a sliding knee dive across the stage and Russell clapping his hands above his head, running like a crazy man, and I'd just think, "Yeah, I can do this." ROSS: I admire their stamina, but I admire anyone who went to see 'em 21 nights. I admire your stamina more. [laughs] ♪ Just so you like me... HARRIS: It's just the most ridiculous thing. It was preposterous, and it was extraordinary, but it was a triumph. KAPRANOS: There's often this, uh, terrible fate which awaits bands either when they keep going for too long or when they re-form. And that terrible fate is becoming a tribute to the band that you once were. DJ LANCE ROCK: They could rest on their laurels and just come out and just do some sort of, like, "Now we're gonna do a greatest hits show," but no, they're challenging themselves and their audience and they're doing, like, you know, radio opera. ♪ Bergman, Bergman ♪ Bergman, Bergman... HARRIS: Ron and Russell came up with the idea of Ingmar Bergman, the film director-- what if he had been lured to Hollywood with the promise of big budgets and big bosoms? And it was played on Swedish national radio. After that, they performed it at the L.A. Film Festival and, you know, got a really good reaction. KAPRANOS: They've always had the desire to push on and create something new, and I think that's probably what appealed to... to them about the FFS project. [Russell snickering] -For fuck's sake. -[laughter] RUSSELL: We had met the guys in Franz Ferdinand 12 or 13 years ago in Los Angeles. We had, you know, like bands tend to do, they say, "Hey, we should try to do something together sometime." ♪ I'm just a little guy from the suburbs... ♪ Ten years later, we're walking in the morning, just taking a little stroll in downtown San Francisco, and we see this guy walking by, and we go, "That looks like Alex Kapranos. Hey, it is Alex Kapranos." So we say, "Hey, Alex." He goes, "Hey, Sparks guys." He was on his way to the dentist. He had chipped one of his teeth. So we said, "Remember we were gonna do a project together?" He said, "Yeah, we got to do that." So we talked about, "Well, let's just try one song together, see what happens." KAPRANOS: In Ron's typically perverse way... [laughs] he sent over "Collaborations Don't Work." ♪ Collaborations don't work ♪ They don't work ♪ They don't work... And it was so obviously a test. It was like, "All right, you think you can collaborate, do you?" ♪ Collaborations don't work ♪ They don't work, they don't work... ♪ RON: We opened up the door for, uh, any return ammunition coming our way. ♪ I ain't no collaborator... CONGLETON: As a response to that, Alex sent kind of a country groove. So this song was literally a strange little argument that they were doing online. ♪ I ain't no collaborator... We sent it over to Ron, and then suddenly, it came back with Russell singing on top of it and these new melodies. We got this great buzz. It was like, "Oh, God, this is fantastic." Everybody was tentatively kind of going like, "You know, this sounds like it could almost be... [whispers]: like, an album, maybe." [laughs] ♪ I ain't no collaborator... AUKERMAN: One day, I pull up Pitchfork, and I read that Franz Ferdinand has made an entire record with Sparks. And it was just like, "What?" It made me say, "Yeah, Sparks is back. "Okay, yeah, let me pay attention to what they've been doing over the past ten years." RUSSELL: "Johnny Delusional" became the first single. One of my favorite lines-- it's kind of one of the saddest lines, I think, in a, uh, Sparks song is: "I'm borderline attractive from afar." And that-that line, to me, is really, uh, touching. ♪ Some might find me borderline attractive from afar... ♪ CONGLETON: "Some might find me "borderline attractive from afar, but afar is not where I can stay, and there you are." It's beautiful. I mean, that's hilarious, but it's also really beautiful. ♪ Though I want you ♪ I know I haven't a chance... ♪ There's a real melancholic vulnerability about it. CONGLETON: It's very sad, but it sounds celebratory. It's, like, this meditation on loneliness. ♪ Paging Mr. Delusional... KAPRANOS: I often feel, with Ron's lyricism, that he's metaphorically, like, slicing his chest open and kind of going like, "Here's my heart." ♪ You're wanted at the front desk ♪ "Here's my heart. Has nobody noticed?" ♪ Wouldn't it be terrible ♪ If there's no music there? HARRIS: TheFFS album, it-it introduced them to a crowd that maybe hadn't been aware of them before. We particularly noticed it in Latin America where Franz Ferdinand, uh, were very popular there. ♪ Wouldn't it be terrible if there's no music there? ♪ RUSSELL: A lot of those people, they've become Sparks fans and really kind of hard-core Sparks fans, and they had been introduced via theFFS album. ♪ Though I want you... INTERVIEWER: Been watching you play live. It seems to be more of a kind of enjoyment thing. It just seems to be fun. Oh, we're faking it. [laughter] ♪ Johnny Delusional here... Does Franz Ferdinand know how lucky they are that that happened? I hope that they were grateful and psyched. CONGLETON: That's their most exciting record they've done in quite some time, and I really think they learned a lot from working with these elder statesmans of-of pop, you know? [playing "What the Hell Is It This Time?"] Hello. ♪ Historically, historically, we make an appeal ♪ ♪ To something greater than we are ♪ ♪ When we need to heal... HARRIS: Doing the FFS project, they fell in love again with the pop song, and because of that love for the pop song, Hippopotamus was born. ♪ What the hell is it this time? ♪ WINWOOD: Listening toHippopotamus took me straightaway back toKimono My House. The energy of that album is just great. MANKEY: When I put the headphones on and listened to it for the first time, I thought, "Holy cow. This is like when we were back at Ron and Russ's mom's house, you know?" I loved that. HARRIS: The reviews were incredible. It was near four- and five-star reviews across the board. It was, um, included in the "album of the year" lists, you know, worldwide. And the fact that Sparks have had a top-ten record is because they're not trying to be what other people want them to be.

They love repetition. I mean, you can hear their love of repetition in their music. You know, they have a hook, they have a phrase that's repeated over and over and over again. And in their life, even the way their day is structured-- you know, wake up, work out, go to the studio, have your 4:00 p.m. coffee break, go back to the studio, you know, power down. SCHWARTZMAN: They are rock stars that go to breakfast at the same place and get the same thing in the morning, and then go work at... You know, they just... they figured out what works for them and how to do it. I come here religiously every morning to get a little peace and quiet, just to be by myself before we start working. And even once a week, Ron comes here. [quiet chatter] HAYDON: They just keep going up musically with what they're writing. They keep finding new ways to tell their stories. HARRIS: Ron and Russell were in Cannes and met the French film director Leos Carax. They got chatting, and they were talking to him about their screenplay calledAnnette. We got along really well, and when we came back to L.A. after Cannes, we said, "Let's send Leos this project, Annette." And then he said, uh, "God, I really like this. Let me think about it a little bit more." And he did, and he got back to us, and he said, "You know, I'd really like to direct this." We thought, "Oh, this is amazing," but then we were also thinking about our Tim Burton experience and our Jacques Tati experience and going, "Please, dear God, we don't want to have one more of those." -Did you get it? -That's a film project. HARRIS: Historically, they've, you know, nearly had films made on, you know, more than one occasion, and you feel that now is the time, and it will be amazing for them to be able to see their work on a big screen. Oh, hello. Welcome to the set. RUSSELL: After several attempts to get a movie off the ground, Annette has finally been the one film project that's sticking, and it's being shot here in swinging Brussels, Belgium. RON: To get a movie made is a miracle. We obviously feel good about the film, but we also feel good in a really personal kind of way-- this proves that we were right all along. So, uh... so there. Or voilà. SCHWARTZMAN: When you get a Sparks album, I feel like that's where they are, this is what they're into, and they're not gonna be here for long. Do you know what I mean? Like, I feel like by the time you get the album, they're already on to something else. RON: Sparks have a certain sensibility that we've had through all of our albums, whatever the shift in styles through time or different producers or different countries. It's kind of something that we really can't change. ♪ And all the holy places... RUSSELL: From the beginning of rock music when, uh,Blackboard Jungle-- for them to go and start ripping up, uh, movie theater seats-- that, to us, is like the essence and the spirit of what music can be. And I think that those sorts of things have always been maybe in the back of our minds. We don't sit down and say, "What can we do to be provocative or rebellious?" But I think, just by our nature, that's just inherent in what we do. ♪ All that we've done ♪ We've lost, we've won ♪ All that, all that and more... ♪ PALLADINO: I think their creative process has sustained their friendship and brotherliness, and I think being brothers has also sustained their creativity over the years. It's-it's unusual, but they like each other and they respect each other. [cheering] HARRIS: They are... first and foremost, they're-they're gentlemen, and they are, you know... they're polite and they're considerate, extraordinarily creative, you know, and they're funny. -Oh, did I not push the button? -Yeah. [laughs] You got to push the button. RON: We're able to work kind of without a lot of conversation. The quieter it is, the better it is, because we know we're kind of onto something and we can communicate with each other in-in kind of nonverbal ways just by having worked together for so long. DES BARRES: It's some kind of magical combination of brother blood and, I don't know, cosmic interference, but I have loved them for all these years, and I'm really proud of it. ♪ All that we've done ♪ We've lost, we've won... RUSSELL: I can't imagine having done a career as a solo artist 'cause I just think the two of us are sort of inseparable when it comes to our passion for music. I think his songs and my singing are one and the same. RON: I have that security when I'm working with Russell. If I were to work with myself, I-I feel, you know, really, really nervous. It would put me in a position where I-I just wouldn't be able to-to take... take it. EVAN WEISS: To me, they've been such an example of how to age in this business with grace and dignity and treat your band and your crew, uh, kindly. And not to reduce it to such crude terms, but they're just cool as fuck. [laughing]: Yeah. RUSSELL: Now that Ron isn't around, I can finally tell the real story. Uh, all of the songs are mine. All 840 songs written by me, sung by me, performed by me. So, uh, anyway, I just thought it should come out now. [whispers]: Just between you and me... Sparks. He's just a singer.

RON: We're deeply appreciative. We don't... we don't take any of this for granted, and, uh, we'll be back soon. [cheering] Thank you. RON: A lot of times, people are trying to find the key to Sparks somehow, and I think that really it's out in the open with what we're doing lyrically and musically. RUSSELL: Being Russell and being Ron and being Sparks, it's kind of one and the same. RON: That is what we are. There isn't some thing behind the curtain. SHERMAN-PALLADINO: The mystique and that whole thing is part of what makes them cool no matter what. They don't owe us anything. They-they give us the music. That's... We... That's all we need. BOHEM: It is symbiotic. It's like the two of them make up this whole that is Sparks. You know, those of us who've been lucky enough to come and go in that, like, it-it... it's an amazing and very cool thing to be around. ♪ STEWART: I don't feel a kind of ownership with them. I think it's really important when people come along 20 or 40 years later, you don't say, "Oh, I was there all along, and where were you?" You say, "Welcome aboard, and here's more." WRIGHT: There's something to be said for the fact that sleeper success will keep people talking about them a lot longer than artists that are a lot more popular. I think the fact that they've always kept hungry and consistently pushed the envelope is exactly why I wanted to make this film. OSWALT: Their songs are worlds that you really need to delve into, but once you delve into 'em, the rewards are incredible. JONES: I wish I had that drive or that commitment. I'm just like, "Ah, fuck it. I can't be bothered." FLEA: Some bands will give you an outfit to wear, and some bands will give you a sewing machine and some needle and some thread and let you make what you want but inspire you and give you the energy to make stuff. And that's the kind of band that Sparks is to me. BECK: There's several kind of archetypes of bands. There's the bands who are wildly popular in their day and adulation, and then there's bands that sow all these seeds and foment all these ideas that grow up in other places. And, uh, there's some corollary in nature. Like, we wouldn't survive without the bees. Sparks are part of the ecosystem of music.

Russell has been an uncredited voice actor in 27 Hollywood animated feature films. Ron briefly dated EÉdith Piaf. Russell is not singing in English on Kimono My House. Ron has worn the same white shirt, a shirt he purchased at Marks and Spencer in December 1973, for the last 46 years. Between 1989 and 1993, Russell was a NASCAR driver. Ron has written many novels under the pen name John le Carré. After realizing he was too small to compete in college football, Russell trained for nine months as a jockey. 26 days before every tour, Ron goes on the alphabet diet, eating foods in alphabetical order. Day one: avocados or asparagus. Day 26: zucchini. In 1982, we started the first ever seahorse rehabilitation ranch, Back in the Saddle. The tragic decline in the seahorse population has been a cause we've long felt strongly about. Sparks really only have two songs, a fast one and a slow one. We constantly rewrite the lyrics for these songs to give the appearance of having written nearly 300 songs. And finally, we would like to reveal that Ron is really Russell.
