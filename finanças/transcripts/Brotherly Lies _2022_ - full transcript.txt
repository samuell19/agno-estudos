(gentle music) (computer keys clicking) - [Kenny] Okay, so I just add account, right? - [Harry] Yeah, just hit the little plus sign in the upper corner there. - Now this is where I get into trouble. Configure settings? - It's not a scary thing at all, I promise. Just click on the other open tab where we found that server name, good. Now copy that. (keys clicking) - This one? - Yeah, now just paste that in the server name on the other page here. And enter your username and password. (keys clicking) Now just hit import. And, voila. - Harry, you're a lifesaver. I can never get these damn email settings. - Oh, sure you could. There's plenty of videos online that would walk you through it. - It's not the same, and by the time I would have figured it out, there'd be another software update and then I'd have to start all over again. - My dear Kenny, you should know by now that all of life's questions have been answered in YouTube videos. You do not need people like me around anymore. - YouTube would have taken me at least an hour. With you, it took minutes. I think that's incredibly valuable. - I should get going. - No, it's so early. I mean, what do you have to do at your place? - Nothing special, I guess. - Exactly, I mean, how much Farmville can you play in a day? (soft jazz music) - My brother is just... - Lex. - No. This is ridiculous. He's pretending to be Shane's friend so he could Hollywood hustle him into writing that miniseries about his stupid life. - He's not gonna be here much longer. Couple more days and he leaves. - That's what you said last week, but he's still here. Look at this. He turned the AC on even though it isn't even hot inside. No wonder I'm getting headaches. The barometric pressure in here is all over the place. - Stomping around with a negative attitude isn't gonna make the time go faster. - Whenever I ask Shane to go see a movie or go for a hike, he's busy writing a screenplay. But of course he's got plenty of time to lounge around the pool with him. - So is that when you auditioned for "Jurassic World"? - I didn't audition for "Jurassic World." I turned down the part when I asked for script rewrites. I refused to sully my brand with substandard writing. Lex, I invited Ed and Bev to come over tonight. Thought we'd have a little party. - Fine, but Shane and I won't be here. - We won't? - We're going to see the silent Warhol film retrospective downtown. - Why didn't you say something? - I did. - That's okay. Lex and I can see them another night. - Whatever. It's only playing there tonight, though. - What was I saying? - You were telling Shane how we met. - Ah, it was like an '80s sitcom. We were both reaching for the last package of gluten-free pasta at Whole Foods. - It was a hard-fought battle, but in the end, the rigatoni was mine. - Only on the condition she was to have dinner with me, even though I didn't know a thing about the Office of Foreign Missions. - What did you talk about over dinner? - Talk? By the time he was grating the Parmesan, I had my tongue in his ear. - I still see it as a sign from the universe that we stop in to visit Lex and he has a screenwriter renting the guesthouse. - Well I'm trying to write. I'm mostly flailing, though. - There is a lot of interest in my life story to be adapted into a miniseries. Could even lead to a bidding war with the studios. - Do studios still have bidding wars? - Of course they do, if the material's good, bulletproof good. - [Shane] That's very true. Lord knows you have plenty of stories. - Some of them are even true. - Okay then. Off the record. Did you really go skinny dipping with, uh, what was her name, the right-wing congresswoman, just so you could tip off the press to take photos of it? - What a memory that was. Calistoga Hot Springs, one of my favorite places on Earth. It's where Laura and I were headed when I decided to drop in on Lex. I haven't seen him since he, you know, took the pills. God, that was six, eight months ago? I had no idea what Lex would do for love, or the lack of it. I don't know. I guess if you never had something, then you experience it, and it's taken away... Is it that hard being gay these days? - Now you're gripping the cue way too tight. Try and relax it a little bit. - But now it feels like a wet noodle. - Well just try and keep a smooth motion with it then. But don't take your eye of it. - Kenny, this is good. Darren thinks he can get me an offer on the house. - Really? That's great. - It's below my asking, but after everything's paid off there should still be enough to put a down payment on a condo in LA. - Lower than asking. I mean, I could get your asking price for my place, and it's half the land you've got. - Can't afford to be picky in this market. Just happy someone's interested. - I would hate to see you just give the place away. I mean, I can lend you what you need. - No, Harry. Thank you, though. You know you've been so good to me through all this. But I have to try and get my own life. - Back to LA? What will you do there? - Well, I don't know. I maybe get back into acting, or voice-over work. Or sometimes I even think about going back to school, to be a therapist, but I don't know. - Lex, did you get a chance to read those new pages I emailed to you? - I did. They're wonderful. - Eh, I don't know. The more I think about them, the more I hate them. - You're wrong. The story's vivid. It makes me wanna read more. - I just wanna start over, again. - You can't delete everything you write. No wonder you're running outta Xanax. - It's just that I was supposed to be finished by now. Labor Day is next week. I have to be back to work the day after. (lid closing) - You need to stop letting my brother seduce you. - I don't know. His life could be a compelling miniseries for sure. - That's crap. There's nothing compelling about a superficial existence. You know, he got into the industry through our mother, who married an abusive psychopath that used to beat us up all the time. You think that's original? Was it the shooting? Trust me, that wasn't compelling. It was pathetic. It's a CSI episode at best. - Maybe it's that he came through the other side. He's a survivor. The screenplay I'm writing is about surviving. - Nice that he can get on with this life, but I got stuck with the nightmares. - Excuse me, um, David was just gonna jump in the pool, and I was wondering where I could find the towels. - Sure. Fresh out the dryer. - Thanks. David had a lot of trauma over that awful event. He doesn't show it, but anyway, thanks. - Hearing loss in his left ear from the gunshot. Noise trauma, poor guy. - The only point I was trying to make, believe me, I didn't want to upset you, is that some people are survivors, and others get crushed by life's tragedies, and this is simply one of the cruelties of living. - I get that. And in your screenplay, you develop that idea with depth and insight, which makes it moving. But the story of a 14-year-old boy who kills his stepfather is sleazy. The trial was sleazy, and the lawyers were sleazy. And my brother was totally disconnected from what I was going through. - I'm sorry. Really, I, I should... - I'm sorry. It just hit a nerve. I'll get you my notes on those pages. And they're good. I'm not gonna let you delete them. (soft jazz music) - I didn't know you were a pool player. - It's all a ruse to hustle Harry here. - Did you ever get a chance to listen to that Spotify playlist I sent you? - Yeah, yeah, I did. I loved it. I listen to it all the time. Just last night in fact. - Did I hear you say your screenplay was about survival? - Yeah, I mean it is in the metaphorical sense, I guess. But really it's about, you know, it's about everything. - [Harry] Oh, so it's Wikipedia in script form. - I'm gonna read Lex's feedback and get some work done. - Harry, you're a better man than that. - [Harry] We don't need another story about survivors. We have 40 seasons of that damn reality series. - Lex says he's talented. - Well, if he's the next William Goldman, why doesn't he have an agent? What's he doing wasting his time up here in Silicon Valley? It's because writing 10-second quips for social media sites is more within his grasp. - I don't get it. You are the sweetest man in the world, and you can't bring yourself to say one nice thing about Shane? - Oh, he's okay. I don't mean to say he's a bad guy. It's just... Just burns me that Lex gets so wooed by his mediocrity. Shane hasn't done a thing to earn Lex's adoring gaze. - Careful, you're sounding jealous. - Oh, what's the difference? Lex seems determined to move away anyhow. - I thought that might be bothering you. - I'm glad you didn't see him at the beginning of the year when he first came up. He was in such a bad way. Needed someone to take care of him. That's how I remember it anyway. - He's still fragile. - All those long afternoons together, cold evenings, hot chocolate, Netflix. I really loved watching him gain strength and begin to enjoy things more, even the little things. I remember one night we went to the movies and I dropped Lex off and went home and I was getting ready for bed, and I realized that I missed him. I mean, I couldn't wait to see him the next day and that's when I knew I never wanted him to leave here. - Oh, Harry. - I never said anything to him, I promise. I mean, he'd just been through an awful time and wasn't really over it and I didn't think it was wise to let him know that someone had become dependent on him. I didn't wa... I didn't wanna say anything that would frighten or confuse him, I mean, my God, I'm old enough to be his father. And I never saw myself as the daddy type. So I just hedged and procrastinated and obsessed over him. Trying to find the right time to tell him how I felt. And I was really getting close, when suddenly he's head over heels in love with his handsome, sensitive, younger, tenant. Who's taken up residence in Lex's heart in addition to his guesthouse. - I could see how having Shane here for the past six or seven weeks, just the two of them, even though he's in the guesthouse, how he could fall hard for him. - Never thought I could feel this way after Robert died. - [Shane] Kenny, your phone's ringing. It's your husband. (Kenny sighing) (crickets chirping) - Lex has changed towards me. He used to look up to me. Playing out scenes from famous movies, his Gloria Swanson to my William Holden. Told me I was the best big brother ever. Now he's just so, angry. What do you think? Justin Timberlake? Pierce Brosnan? - Brosnan. Keep it classy tonight. - You're the boss. - Oh. I'll be your wife, but not your boss. Or your mother. (lips smacking) - Man, am I lucky I let you have that pasta. You are the only woman I ever met that I just knew, knew I was going to marry. - What about all those models and actresses? - Nothing. Just nothing. I can prove it, because when they wanted to get married, I said no. - You are so full of shit. - I'm serious. Ask my manager. - Doesn't matter. I still feel like the lucky one. - Now who's full of shit? David Frasier is a brand that's disintegrating. The acting offers are drying up. Debts aren't getting paid. - Uh-uh, uh-uh, I told you. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. - Thank you. Maryann Williamson. - Oh, sorry. - No, come in. It's fine. - [Lex] You were looking for this jacket? - [David] Yeah. Decided on a different look, though, so I don't think I'll wear it. You put it on. That's a cool jacket. Oh, looks good on you. Where'd you get it? - You gave it to me, remember? - I did? Damn, I've got good taste. - I think David looks so handsome channeling Pierce Brosnan. - He looks great, always does. - Try and have some fun tonight. You've been living like a hermit for months. - I haven't been a hermit. I leave the house. - Oh yeah, Warhol Silent Film Festival, a thrill a minute. I just want you to think of tonight as a chance to put the past behind you. What's done is done, right? - It's easy to say. - This will be more fun than going to the movies with Shane. Is he a good screenwriter? Seriously, could he write the miniseries? - Jesus, the miniseries. - I've been offered good money for it, which indirectly means you're in for a taste too if you play along. - Here we go. Shane's trying to write a serious movie script. You shouldn't be distracting him. - I'm not. He's the one who's always asking me questions. - I don't think you should make your life story public. - Why? I'm not ashamed of my life. - It'll be done tastefully, and David's not lying about the offers. - Then he should find someone else to write it. And please, leave me and Mom out of it. - I can't leave you out of it. That's the part all the studios are going to be interested in. - Well, you're exploiting in me in an ugly situation just to keep what's left of your career going. - Jesus, you've become such a drama queen lately. You're in charge of your life, not me. Take it by the horns. Make something happen. - I'm sorry, not everyone's as energetic and enlightened as you are. - David's done a lot of work on himself. - You were such a promising kid. Bright, creative. You had my good looks. I'd kill for your height. And since being gay is a plus in Hollywood these days, you could leverage it. Gotta do something about all that. And there are still certain casting agents, you could make abandon their ethics, you know. - Even if that was meant as a compliment, I don't exactly feel ready for prime time these days. - Shane thinks you're adorable. And he's right. - No. Really? - Oh yeah, always complimenting you. - He's just being polite. - No, I've heard him over the last couple of days. Said your notes have been, incredibly helpful. Where you going? - I'm going to make sure the hors-d'oeuvres are put together. - [David] Nothing too weird, okay? - No weirder than us. (door closing) - You're really into Shane, aren't you? - I don't know. Yeah, I guess I am. - Well, just, play cool with him. Don't let your desperation show. - I don't think I have. Wait, you think I'm being desperate? - I just remember with the last boyfriend where you constantly texted him, sent him little gifts. - That's a total exaggeration. - I don't think Stephen would have ghosted you so quickly if he hadn't felt so, smothered. It was pretty obvious. - His name was Scott. You were never around, so you don't know what happened. - Don't get so defensive. Just basing it on the time I saw you two together, and I'm not saying anything different than all those high-priced psychiatrists have said. When it comes to guys, you probably self-sabotage, trip over your own feet, you know? - I probably am. - Oh man. Look at me. 40 years old, and might as well be 400 as far as the studios are concerned. When I was younger, times were good. The offers I could turn down, the phone calls I could ignore, all the agents wanting me. I couldn't tell you when the hustle started to get so, tough. When you know you still have passion and ability, and you have to work so hard to get anyone to give two shits about you. Sometimes I look at my face in the mirror and I can't help noticing that something's (sighs) missing. Then I start to really sweat thinking it's my Future. You're my younger brother and that's, that's why I bust your balls about getting your shit together while there's still time for you to make a life for yourself. (bird calling) (crickets chirping) (Kenny sighing) (storm brewing) (phone clicking) (phone pinging) - Hey ya. - Hey. - I didn't mean to interrupt. - No, it's nothing. - I guess I'm early. - Ed and Bev aren't here yet. - You look good at least. I love that shirt. - Oh, well, my husband hates it. - Well I respectfully disagree with him. - Normally, you can see a ton of stars from here. It's getting cloudy, though. I wonder if it'll rain. - That's fine by me. It might cool things off. - Let's hope. (thunder cracking) Wow, that's really thundering. - It's nothing to be scared of. - No, it's just unsettling. - Well, you look great at least, and I said that already, I'm so sorry. - It's okay. I thanked you already. (flames crackling) - You know, I... - Kenny, I... - Oh, no I'm sorry. - No, no, please go ahead. - You looked like you were gonna... - No, it's nothing. (thunder cracking) Sounds like it's getting closer. - It does. (flames crackling) - So, who's the, um, influencer? - The influencer? Wow, how'd you know that? Did we talk about that? - I remember you said it might be the title of your screenplay. - No, it's just a working title really. - Oh, I'm sorry. I thought... - No, you're right. That's the current title. The influencer was my dad. He was a mortgage broker who lost everything in the Great Recession. He had to do all kinds of things to keep us going. - Like, what? - Oh, like, he assembled products at home and he sold them through Amazon. He even played poker in Reno casinos when money got really scarce. - Sounds like an amazing guy. - Yeah. He was. - Makes sense about what you said earlier, being a survivor. - Kenny, this summer went by too fast. I mean, I know everything is fast now, but I just, I was so excited to finish this screenplay. And between you and me, I have made no progress on it. - Is this the first time you've tried to write a screenplay? - No, I've written some spec treatments for a few producers. Published a few short stories. Nothing very good, really. I'd love to be able to do it full time, but that just seems like a pipe dream. I get so distracted. Other obligations, you know. You don't wanna hear about all that. It's draining. - That's okay. Really I... You know, Lex showed me some of the short stories that you wrote and, I loved them. They were wonderful. (soft jazz music) - It's weird. I've wanted to talk to you. You know. Really talk with you. But, I think this is the first time we've been alone. - Nope. We spent that afternoon together, remember? - Oh, when I ran into you at the farmers market? Wasn't exactly private. You can't count that. - It was just you and me. We walked around a whole afternoon together. You didn't say anything. - No, didn't, did I? I was babbling about metaphor and satire, all the pretentious writer cliches, huh? I felt awkward. - Didn't, didn't show. - Huh. At least it inspired me to put together that Spotify playlist for you, so the day wasn't a total loss. - It's interesting because I used to be totally in love with this guy that just idolized '90s modern rock. It was a few years ago in Amsterdam when I was visiting for the first time. He was a DJ at this club called the Queen's Head in, uh, Zieg, Zieg Sta, Zieg, whatever. And he was, so sexy, I just had to go and talk to him. (chuckles) It was my luck, of course, he didn't speak a word of English. And so we spent the next couple of weeks trying to make each other understand how we felt. It ended up not even mattering that we only knew a few words. - Was it worth it? Even for a few weeks? (soft jazz music) - Absolutely. I'd do it again. - If you weren't married, of course. (soft jazz music) (door opening) (storm brewing) - Is that thunder I heard? - Yes, still rattles me. I don't care how harmless it is. - We need the rain. - We can have rain without thunder. - Where is everybody? - Do we count? - So, how do I look? Nobody say age-inappropriate. - You look great. - You look fine. So, what time are the guests getting here? - Any minute. Let's get the outside lights on and the pool lights. Laura, the hors-doeuvres. - Yep, coming up. Where were you two earlier? - Nothing, excuse me? - You weren't out by the pool, were you? That thunder's getting closer. - [Shane] Ooh. - Won't catch me out there tonight. (footsteps fading) (footsteps approaching) - You guys, uh, feeling adventurous? Just some low-grade MDMA. I took two. Probably the last time I can let it fly since I'm getting married. Thought I'd offer it to you guys and Harry. - Well I mean it's been a while. But what the hell? - Uh, among friends, right? - Let's party. - [Laura] We should turn on some music. - Good idea. Where? Ah, okay. Darling, would you play DJ this evening? - Oh, I don't know how these smart houses work. - If you can negotiate trade tariffs with the Federated States of Micronesia, you can figure out a Spotify playlist. (storm brewing) Have you thought about writing my miniseries? - It deserves better than me. You know, the money people would never let a fledgling screenwriter tackle it anyway. - That's a lame excuse. Come on. Be honest. You think my life is superficial. - What makes you say that? - Lex told me. Said you think it's trivial and beneath you. - I never said that. - David, it doesn't seem to be playing. - Duty calls. (cork popping) (wine pouring) - You know, we should probably keep away from this with the MDMA. - Oh, yeah, it's just for appearances really. - I, uh, I had so many things that I wanted to talk to you about. - Well, it's, you know, there's people here and there's people coming over and there's... - I don't mean to be pushy. - I know. - You know, I just wish that you'd spent the entire summer here. - Yeah, there was no way. I had obligations. - [David] What song is this? It's great. - It's "Slip Away" by Lost Fun. Okay, be honest. I mean, I made a complete fool out of myself, didn't I? - No, you didn't. - I don't know. I felt like I was just desperately trying to impress you with literary shiny objects. - Honestly, I... Honestly, I thought you were so sweet. You reminded me of Axel, the guy from Amsterdam. - Really? - Yeah. - Well that makes my night. The MDMA hasn't even kicked in yet, and that makes my night. - [David] What year was this album from? - 1994. It's just, I felt so stupid this entire time because, you know, I was very struck by you, right off. - [David] I love '90s music. Is there any Green Day or No Doubt on here? - Not on that iPad. Now I don't want you to freak out when I say this. - No. I won't. - But I just think you are incredibly attractive and wonderful. - Shane, don't. Please don't. We have to stop this. I can't. I'm feeling anxious already. (knocking on door) - [David] Ed and Bev have arrived. (soft upbeat music) (door opening) (thunder cracking) - [Laura] Well, hello, Harry. - That thunder is sounding foreboding out there. - We thought it was Ed and Bev because you knocked. - Well, formalities die hard at my age. - Can I get you a drink? - Yeah, Scotch. - [Lex] Hi, Harry, let me get your jacket. - Thank you. - Mm-hm. - Ed and Bev must be running late. I'll be right back. - Look at this. Our old Ouija board. - That's the analog version. Download the app, then you can just text any dead person you want. - Try and spend some time with Lex tonight. Flirt with him. He's got a big crush on you. - Oh, I doubt that. - Just show him some affection. He could use the ego boost. Do it as a favor to me. - It doesn't have to be a favor. I care about Lex. - Lex, Shane was just telling me how cute you look tonight. - Oh please. - Lex already knows that. (phone ringing) - It's Ed. Just a sec. Yeah. - Is he bothering you? - No, I like his energy. - I didn't know you liked '90s modern rock. - Well you like System of a Down. - Yeah, but not to dance to. - Ed and Bev aren't coming. Bev has a migraine. - Really? Maybe we can catch the Warhol film series. - We'd miss over half of it. - I wouldn't mind. - Consider ourselves lucky. Ed and Bev have become total neurotics since their Nexium group shut down. (thunder cracking) - [Laura] You didn't have to kill the power to avoid eating my hors-doeuvres. - A. (soft saxophone music) M. Y. (soft saxophone music) Amy. I don't know anyone named Amy. (soft saxophone music) Oh, shit. Wait. There was that Delta flight attended I hooked up with about five years ago. (ice jiggling) (soft saxophone music) (game piece sliding) Uno. Okay. Okay. Huh, one more try. (soft saxophone music) Ah. Mm. (soft saxophone music) (game piece sliding) M. (game piece sliding) O. (game piece sliding) M. Oh shit. Mom. Are you in this room? Is your ghost in this room? (soft saxophone music) You were so cool to us. And so caring. (soft saxophone music) You just had to go and marry that sociopath after Dad died. (soft saxophone music) (ice jiggling) (soft saxophone music) Was the money that good? (soft saxophone music) Uh, money's no good if you aren't around to enjoy it. (soft saxophone music) It was confusing. (soft saxophone music) Was dangerous. (soft saxophone music) Until it ended. (soft saxophone music) (crickets chirping) - [Harry] Looks like the thunder has moved on. - [Lex] I hope so. - Taking a psychotropic this evening was in bad taste, wasn't it? - You know I'd never judge you. But this. - Yeah (chuckles). Please don't move away from here. - I have to. (soft music) I should never do drugs at parties. It's so, disorienting. - How are you gonna drive home? - The same way I always do. Thinking about you. (soft music) - You know, all this time we've spent together, and I've never seen you high. - No. Although for a year after my husband died, I was never sober. Fortunately, at the tech company I worked for, it was hard to tell. I'm gonna miss you so much. - I'm gonna miss you too. But we'll keep in touch. Email, FaceTime. - You know what I'm saying. - Aw, Harry. - I have to. I mean, when you got that offer to sell the house, I just, I hate the idea of not spending those winter evenings together anymore. - I told you I was only here to get better. It was always temporary. Never permanent. - Yes, yes, you were always clear about that. - I'm being clear now. I need you to believe me. - Of course I believe you. The age difference. I know age isn't supposed to matter anymore, but is it awkward for you? - It's not that. (Lex sighing) I'm in love with Shane. Isn't that the most stupid thing? Especially because I don't even think I have a chance with him. I used to. And, I'm trying to keep a positive attitude that, maybe, it could still work out somehow. (soft music) Why Shane instead of you? No reason worthy of you. - How often I've wanted to touch you, be intimate with you. - Please, I can't. - Especially now that I've embarrassed us both. - Don't say that. You're a good man. You know that. - Just not, good enough. (soft music) - I'm gonna make sure you get home in one piece, okay? (footsteps fading) (balls colliding) - I don't shoot pool that well in the light, let alone in the dark. - The clouds have really cleared up. The moon is so bright. - It's bright, but not that bright. - What are you saying, Laura? - It's obvious Dr. Feelgood, aka my fiance, probably prescribed something to enhance things? - I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about. - No, of course not. Things left unsaid seems to be the theme for this gathering. - I wouldn't bet on that. - I'd be happy to lose that bet. Believe me. (soft jazz music) - So tell me. Is it true that you worked on the Iran nuclear deal under Obama? - (smirks) No. Did David tell you that? - Yeah. - Not at all. I privately briefed Secretary Kerry on a small, unrelated project around the same time. But when he describes me to people, I am the architect of the JCPA. - So what branch of the State Department are you involved with? - Good question. Depends on the day, I guess. - I hope you're kidding. - I wish I was. Democracy keeps getting heavier to carry. (soft jazz music) - I can't imagine anything worse than the collapse of democracy. (soft jazz music) Except for the A bomb. - Oh, there's worse. When the people who can actually do something to save it decide it's not worth the effort anymore, they just collect and horde their own resources and ideas in preparation for when it all collapses. Full-on John Bolton stuff. And I'm not just talking about the United States. I'm talking about the world. Key people. Capable people. They don't see government structures are useful. Imagine the Hoover Dam collapsing and I'm getting paid to put Band-Aids on it. - You sure of all that? When you look out onto that bright moon, those millions of stars, and none of it matters, and it's all just darkness? - I think it's just as beautiful as you do. And calming, and inspiring. Maybe even a symbol of some greater truth. Something bigger than all of us that'll keep us functioning as a human race. (soft music) But I can't ignore my professional perspective. And I can't just magically think it all away. My clear and logical mind sees the world leaders for who they really are. An apathetic power elite preparing to save themselves while the rest of us consume ourselves. (soft jazz music) - We shouldn't have this conversation. I have to sleep alone tonight. - Well that's why I'm with David. Even with all of his issues, I'm lucky we found each other. He's passionate, vital. And he holds me while I sleep. Keeps me from dreaming about tariffs, sanctions, dwindling resources. (Laura sighing) - Mom, I know this sounds weird coming from me since I was never one to talk about my feelings. Ever. But I, uh need some advice now. (David sighing) My brother hates me. Your son, he hates me, and I love him. He's the only family I have left, and I want him to be, happy. And he never got over the shooting. Now I'm a tough enough nut that I can file and forget. Can you make a sign if you're hearing me, Mom? I want him to forgive me, so if you could talk to him, that'd be great, yeah. You two were always so close. He loved you so much. Make a sign if you're hearing me. Any sign. - Between the music, the moonlight and the MDMA, it feels like we're in some kind of exotic place. - Yes, the MDMA is stronger than I expected. - Here. You need to be drinking water. - Thank you. (soft music) Shane, what are you doing? - I've wanted to touch your face since the first time we met. (soft music) - What do you expect from me? - Just to listen. (soft music) We're going to be going in different directions soon, and I need to tell you... - Shane. You have to know that this isn't possible. Lex is my best friend, and he's crazy about you. (soft music) I can't do this to him. (soft music) Do you know how emotionally attached he is to you? - Yeah. Of course I do. (soft music) I already feel guilty for leading him on. I, I... I didn't do anything on purpose. (soft music) I just wasn't thinking about anyone except myself. - Lex told me about all the time you spent together. All the walks and the hikes. That night at the lake under the stars. He's told me about all that. (soft music) - I was very lonely. I just wanted company after my relationship ended. (soft music) I got insecure about finishing this screenplay, and Lex, Lex just kept me from panicking. - Lex said it was the best sex he ever had. Congratulations. - I didn't realize how vulnerable he was until it was too late. I know it's all my fault. (soft music) - Would you have gotten serious about Lex if we hadn't met? (soft music) - I don't know. Maybe. (soft music) When you feel empty inside, anything is possible. (soft music) - Look, I'm married. I'm trying to adopt a kid. (soft music) I have a life. - I know, but is it the life you want? I'm serious. You've been flirting with me for weeks. - Don't. My husband is a good man. He was a little suspicious as to why I would wanna spend the summer apart from him. I don't think he bought the whole Lex needs his best friend's support excuse. He's a software engineer who thinks he can just solve every issue by writing an algorithm. (bird calling) I keep my inner source code behind a lotta firewalls because if he saw what was written what was programmed, he'd be very critical. He'd be very hurt. I've just been going through the motions of living, and I don't know when that happened. - Kenny. - I want to respond. You're saying all the right things, but I need to just, run. - No, don't run. - I have to run. It's all I can do. I knew you were into me. Of course I did. That's why I avoided being alone with you because I felt so guilty. - Let me kiss you. - I can't. We can't. Because it'll be a ticking bomb waiting to go off. There's just no way. (soft piano music) - [Shane] Well, it's time for me to pass out. I'm sorry about the Warhol films. - I'd pour you some lukewarm coffee if I thought it'd help. - It wouldn't, and I'd rather stay altered. (soft jazz music) Yeah, on second thought, I'll take that lukewarm coffee. Man, I have to work tomorrow. - You've been in a weird mood tonight. (soft jazz music) - Did you know that there's an apathetic power elite, preparing to save themselves, while we consume ourselves? (soft jazz music) - Shane. What happened to us? - What do you mean? - You know, we were getting so close. All that time we spent together. The night at the lake. Did I read too much into all that? (soft jazz music) - You might have. I just can't get involved right now. And I'm still rebounding from my last relationship. My life and my work are still a mess. And I'm hardly a catch right now. - How, how can I help? - Lex, these are my problems. I don't wanna go dragging you into them. You got it so good right now. It's time you start creating your future. - I know. I know. You're right. It's just, I've been having these dreams that when we're both in LA, that we could... We see things the same way on so many subjects. That's rare and special, and... (Lex sighing) I'm sorry. I'm exhausted. Don't even know what I'm saying anymore. - You know, the funny thing is, I'm probably gonna up end calling you at 3:00 AM from Mulholland Drive so that you can talk me down from jumping off the Hollywood sign. (lights buzzing) (David groaning) (David sighing) - [Laura] Going to be able to sleep? - Oh yeah. Been here before. - You know you can be honest with me, right? - Where did that come from? - If we're going to be married, we should be able to tell each other things. - Of course. Why would you think otherwise? - I already live with too much deception at my job. I won't have it in my marriage. - I told you all about the shooting. - Yeah? - I don't like that tone. - Everything you've told me, I could have read in the press coverage. - There was nothing more to tell. - The studio developing the miniseries seems to think otherwise. (David scoffing) - Hey, can I give you a hand with anything? - No, I'm good. So, I had a talk with Shane. And he doesn't want a relationship right now, which is totally understandable. He's got a lotta issues to work out, like most of us, I guess. But, maybe things can be different down the road, you know? I'm just happy things are out in the open now. I do feel better. We'll both be in LA. Anything could happen, right? (soft music) (phone buzzing) What the hell is that? (phone buzzing) (phone buzzing) (soft music) (phone pinging) (vehicle passing) - I just told you. The power was out, the WiFi was out, and there's no reception up here. I know. (soft jazz music) I'm not sure. I might go to LA and help Lex get organized. I can't talk about that right now. Okay, it's late and I'm tired and... (soft jazz music) I'll call you tomorrow, okay? (soft jazz music) Get some sleep. (soft jazz music) Good night. (soft jazz music) (gasps) Jesus, you scared me. - [Shane] I heard your voice. (soft jazz music) - Shane, people are still awake. - Kenny, I'm in love with you. I have been since that first day. - Shane. - We could be alone, you know. - We can't spend the night in the guesthouse. - It doesn't have to be the whole night. But we can share some of it together. (soft jazz music) - If this means anything to you, I really want to, but... (soft jazz music) (footsteps approaching) (soft jazz music) (light upbeat music) - All right, so taking a look at the roof, looks good. Should hold up for at least another 15 years. - So the roof passed? - Home inspections aren't a pass or a fail. You know, my job here is to find structural defects, identify any potential safety issues, that kinda thing. When did you get the offer on the place? - Oh, uh, I don't have an official offer yet, but I have someone interested, so I'm just trying to... - Get in front of any issues, yeah. - Right. - No, that's smart. You want the purchase to go smoothly. - Yeah, I just really need it to go through, so thank you for fitting me in on short notice. - Sure, sure, no problem. Um, taking a look at the foundation as well, and you're good on the termites, meaning you don't have any. Is David Frazier your brother? - Yes. - Yeah, he was really good in that television show. (faucet running) Okay, so I still need to check out the master bedroom and bathroom. - Oh, well, my brother's still sleeping in there. - Really? - Yeah, he can be a bit of a late sleeper, but he should be up soon. - All right, um. I could check out the guesthouse, make sure that's up to code. - Let's hope. - Yeah. - You saw it when you came in? - Yeah, yeah, I'll just make my way over there if that's all right? - Yeah, sure. I'll follow you in a minute. (light piano music) - Hey, how's the inspection going? - Good so far. No issues yet. - [Kenny] That's great. Did you get Harry's text? - No, I left my phone in my room. - He said that stand that sells those avocados you like opened up again. I told him to bring some over. - Okay. - What's wrong? You seem depressed. - Shane. I just think about him constantly. - Lex, just don't. It's not healthy for you. - Think he's gonna write that miniseries for David. - Oh God. - They're all supposed to go out for lunch again today. If he ever gets up. - He's up, shaking off last night. (light piano music) - Lex. - Yes. - I did find some issues with the guesthouse. - What kind of issues? - Well, there are clearly some code violations that would need to be disclosed, unless they were brought up to specs. - How much is that gonna cost? - Why don't you come outside with me, and I'll walk you through what needs to be done? - Okay. (faucet running) - [Shane] Good morning. - Hi. David's running a little late from last night. I'll let him know you're here. - Why are you avoiding me? - I'm not. - No? Because you're acting like the straight friend from high school who's regretting what happened the night before. - I think you need to just leave and go back to LA. - No, not before you tell me what's going on. - I'm having a really hard time. So is Lex, even though he's trying to hide it. - Don't tell me that. - He can't stop thinking about you. - And you? - Of course I think about you. - But you still avoid me. - Are you really gonna write David's miniseries? - Honestly? I'm seriously thinking about it. - Why? What happened to the screenplay about your father? - Well, I... It just isn't coming through. I've told you how exhausting it's been trying to make it happen this summer, and I d... Whatever. It's lifeless. You know, David, he tells me all these stories, and he's got actual interest from real producers. You know, it's a powerful story. The shooting alone is a movie. - But Lex doesn't want it written. - Kenny, someone is going to write it. You know that. If it's me, then I can protect him. - Shane, my God, just put yourself in Lex's place for once. Here's this 14-year-old boy desperately struggling with his sexuality, with a sociopath of a stepfather who constantly beats up his mom, who turns to beating up David and him until the fateful night that Lex shoots him. It completed wrecked his life, and you wanna put him through it all again. All the people staring and the horrible social media memes and hashtags. - You're naive if you think Lex can avoid that. - I don't... I'm sorry, I just, I'm confused, and I feel guilty and... Took Lex. (light jazz music) Shane. Please don't. (light jazz music) - Let's go to Amsterdam together. - Go to Amsterdam together? Jesus, you really are a screenwriter. This is why you're so dangerous to me. You just make my head spin. (light jazz music) Shane, I can't, I can't do this. (soft jazz music) (both breathing hard) (soft jazz music) - [Lex] And there's a circuit breaker in here. - [Kenny] Oh my God. (door sliding slowly) (soft jazz music) - [Inspector] I can check that circuit breaker later. I'm not really too worried about it. Did you say the pool is gas-powered and not connected to solar panels? Lex? - Yeah, the gas powers it. - [Inspector] That's still probably really low on the electric bill, I'd think. Uh. Hey, Lex. - Yeah, the solar panels keep the electric bills really low for a house this size. - [Inspector] Um, is it okay if we check out the master bedroom now? (Lex sighing) - Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm getting a bad headache. Can I meet you there in a minute? - [Inspector] Sure, no problem. I'll have some more questions for you, though. - Sure. Sure. (soft music) - Fuck, I can't believe that just happened. - It was my fault. - Oh my God. Lex, Lex, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - Has this been going on the whole time? - No, no. Jesus, no. - Are you in love with him? - It's not what it looks like. - What does that mean? - I don't, I don't... I don't know what I'm doing. I'm not sure. - [Lex] A lot of things are making sense now. - Lex, I swear, there's nothing to make sense of. Absolutely nothing. - [Lex] All those times I saw you and Shane checking each other out. - Don't do that. Just don't do that. - Lex, this is all my fault. Okay, don't blame Kenny. - [Kenny] Shane, leave us alone. - I just, I hate that you found out like this. - [Kenny] There's nothing to find out. You're making things worse. - Okay, well there's not nothing. There's everything that's happened. I mean, we might as well get it out in the open. Lex, I want Kenny to come with me to LA, or Amsterdam, or wherever he wants to go. - Shane, the summer is over. I'm going back to my life in Seattle. I can't play these games. Maybe 10 years ago I could, but I... I don't, I don't know who I am anymore. Clearly not the person I thought I was. - I'm thinking that wine tasting is going to be packed. - [Laura] Oh, David's wimping out on going to Rutherford's. - I'm not. I'm just saying today might not be the best day. - We can go tomorrow instead. You and Shane can work on the miniseries around here. - You know, Shane, I was thinking. We could do a whole section on Las Vegas. What happened in Vegas doesn't need to stay in Vegas. - Did you tell Lex about our plans? - Oh that's right. Lex, Laura and I decided that we're going to live here. This house is just perfect for us. - I was hooked the moment I stepped inside. Felt like home to me. - I know you're moving back to LA, but whenever you wanna use it, consider it your home too. Weekends, summertime, whenever. And don't feel modest about bringing someone with you. We're all adults. - [Laura] Are you bringing a jacket? - [David] Uh, no. - I don't understand. - I'm thinking one of my first projects will be to retile the pool. Something Greek, like at Caesar's Palace. - [Laura] I love that pool. - What are you talking about? - Uh, we're going to move back here. Laura and I discussed it, and we're moving in permanently. Laura loves Northern California, and I have always loved this house. It... - [Lex] You can't move back here. - Why not? - Because I'm going to sell this place. - You're selling it? - I told you. - Since when? - I've told you three times at least. - You have? - Don't you ever listen to me? Do you only care about what you have to say? - Whoa. Why are you getting so freak-out? - I have a house inspector here, right now. He's going over everything to make sure it can be ready to go on the market. - So? Wherever he is, find him and tell him his services aren't needed. I'll pay for him coming out here. Don't worry. - What? - You can't sell it. This is gonna be our home. - [Lex] You can't be telling me this now. - Lex, think. This is the family house. How can you sell it? Do you even know how to sell a house? Hell, do you know if you even own it? - Who do you think owns it? - I do. Well, we do, you and me. Mom bought it, and the trust transferred it to us when she died. - Which is when you gave it me. I said then I'd probably sell it and we could split the money. You said fine, you could use the cash. - I was probably high when I said that. - You said it was mine. - Yeah, to live in, not to sell. - To live in? What does that mean, like a caretaker? - (sighs) Said too much without thinking it through. Being practical has never been my strong suit. - I can't afford to move without selling this place. Being sick put me in debt. - No one is throwing you out in the street, Lex. - I'm counting on this money. I haven't worked in two years. I spent my savings. I took out loans. - Well, sometimes things change. It's as simple as that. - What? - Laura and I are getting married, and we want to get settled. Mom acted in a lot of junk movies to be able to afford this place. She'd have wanted it to stay in the family. - We should discuss this later. - You are such a fucking phony! I kept the house going since she died! - Lex. - Why didn't you just stay away? - Laura and I are getting married. We want to start a family. Who knows? Maybe we'll hate living here and in a year we'll move. - My life isn't worth all this trouble. - Everyone just stop this. David, you know how much Lex has been through. - He doesn't give a shit about what he says to me. Just blames me for everything. - You are to blame. - Everyone calm down. - I'm perfectly calm, Laura. Shit happens. Life isn't fair, and if your life didn't turn out the way you wanted, stop accusing me. - At least I didn't pull the trigger. But I sure as hell said what the lawyers told me to. Right, David? - That's, uh, t-total bullshit. - It's not bullshit. It's the truth. I saw what he did to you, what you let him do to you. - You goddam faggot. - I woulda been there for you. It was self-defense. But you had the future. You had a career. - This is totally inappropriate. - And I'm just wrecked. And you just go through the days with no guilt! - Everyone, please. - It's his excuse for wasting his life. Throwing it away to hurt my career. - That's not true. - Yes, it's hatred, pure hatred! - Maybe things coulda been different for me if I wasn't forced to go through that! - All right, if you could just show me how to get to the attic. - Get out! - Excuse me. - Get outta here! Just leave! - David, calm down. Fine, take the house. I had no idea it meant that much to you. - Okay, that's enough. - I said he could have the house, so let's get packed and get outta here. - That's enough! - Maybe there are some things I'd do differently if I had them to do over again, but I can't. (footsteps fading) (door slamming) (David sighing) Sorry for all the drama. The past is the past. No changing it. (knocking on door) - Lex? Can I have my Xanax pills back? - I don't know where they are. - They're not in my nightstand. - Who cares? - I care. You know this. Don't be stupid, who cares? Where are they? (drawers sliding and closing) - I have no reason to get up tomorrow. - Then you need to make up a reason. What about, what happened to LA, getting an agent, doing voice-over work? You're so damn angry. - If I haven't made it as an actor by now, why would I? - I don't know. You'll have to try harder, I guess. (drawers sliding and closing) - So, you and Shane are a thing now? - We just became physically attracted to each other. It happens. - But you knew how much I was into him. - I didn't instigate it, I mean, my God, we're all isolated from the world up here, weird things can happen. The truth is I did flirt with Shane. I wanted him to think I was sexy. I didn't expect it to go anywhere. I just needed to feel wanted and Shane was a challenge. Smart. Charismatic. Busy with his screenplay. Outta my league. And, slowly I realized how vulnerable and uncertain he is about so many things. I fantasized about him. I even started dreaming about him, and then it just spiraled outta control. - So, what are you gonna do, go away with him? - I can't. There's no way. I'm married and adopting a kid. - That's something I wouldn't know. - Give me those pills. Tomorrow will come, and you'll find some distractions. You'll sell this place. You'll move back to LA. Get some work. Fall in love. Maybe it'll be great, and maybe it won't. But there's so many things to keep you going. Things that at times seem petty and annoying but are crucial to keep you from focusing on... - The truth? - The truth. I don't know what the truth is, do you? - I just wanna swallow all the Xanax. - You'll need a lot more than what I brought with me, like 10 times more. - I'll still take it all. - Stop it. You're behaving like one of those characters from a Ryan Murphy show that you hate so much. If you really wanted to die, you would have done it eight months ago. - I'm so lonely (sobs). - It's okay. You know, you need to stop and give me those pills. (Lex exhaling) Look at me. I know you. You don't really wanna die, do you? - No. That's the problem. I've always wanted to live. (Lex exhaling) - Where is everybody? The going gets a little rough, and everyone vanishes into the woodwork. Lex? We're heading out. Oh, I hate these pants. Look like I should be working at a gas station. - You look fine. (David sighing) - You know, I'm really gonna miss the place. Forgot how pretty it was up here. Nice and tranquil. Been in our family for a long time. Closest thing to roots for me. - Mm-hm. - Woulda been nice. God, I sound like my grandfather or something. (Laura chuckling) Oh well. Wasn't meant to be. - Border ranch will be fine. I could live in a storage container, as long as we're together. - Careful. By marrying me, it might come to that. (both laughing) Lex, we're heading back to SoCal. If you need anything, we're staying at the Brookshires. Let's not dwell on what happened earlier. It's in the past. Life's too short to just focus on tragedies. I know we all said things we're sorry for. We're all, complicated. Otherwise we wouldn't all be so interesting. Seriously, though, I'm sorry if I hurt you, okay? I just wasn't thinking. - Like you said, it's over now. In the past. (birds singing) - Hey, uh, I called that housing inspector back, smoothed things over. Scheduled your appointment for tomorrow. - Thanks. - Kenny, this is for you. Saw you checking it out. It's yours now. I'd love you to have it. - Thank you. - Can I help with the bags? - There's Harry. Perfect timing to help with the bags and say goodbye. - [Laura] I'll unlock the car. - Uh, let them get that. So remember, we're going to be staying with the Brookshires. I'll call you when I have an official wedding date locked in, okay? It would mean everything to me for you to be there as my best man, tell me you'll do that. - You know I will. - If you need anything, just text me, okay? And tell Shane I need to rethink the miniseries. If I hear back from the studios with a fresh approach, then I'll call him. Love you, Little Brother. - I love you too. - Harry, you left two. (birds singing) - You aren't even gone yet, and I feel like I've lost something that'll never come my way again. I just keep failing at everything that's important to me. - Time will pass. You'll move on from this summer. - And you? Will you simply move on? - (sighs) Now he flies away as if nothing had happened. - I really should be going too. - House inspections. Open houses. All these little details. - Lex, I wish I could tell you not to worry. - Harry. - That I'd take care of you and that nothing would make me happier. You've become a part of my life, and a treasured part. You're the only thing that gives it meaning anymore. - Harry, don't. - I know that when you leave here, we'll never see each other again. But believe me, I really did grow to love you. Unconditionally. - Lex? I just wanted to say goodbye. I, I think it's better for everyone if I go back to LA tonight. - You haven't finished your screenplay. - It's finished. (birds chirping) You know I loved all the time we spent together. I mean, you were, you were supportive and encouraging. (birds chirping) I'm just sorry I didn't live up to it. Anyway, take care of him, Harry. (birds chirping) (light piano music) (coffee pouring) (light piano music) - Hi. - Hey. - Want some coffee? (light piano music) It's getting chilly. - Yeah, it was chilly when I got up this morning. (light piano music) - All this is coming in fast. - I know. (light piano music) There are so many things when it comes to selling a house. - It'll keep you busy. It's a good thing. (light piano music) - When do you have to go back? - I'll go back in a couple of days. We have to meet with the adoption agency. Prove to them that we're a nice, stable, homosexual couple. - That's gonna be wonderful. - Yeah. (light piano music) (Lex sighing) - Kenny. - Soon you'll be outta here and starting over in LA. There'll be a million things to keep you busy. You'll be okay. (light piano music) (jazz music)
