Inspired by elements from Mikkel Fønhus' famous novels "The Trail of the Elk" and "Skoggangsmand". Directed by Walter Fürst Cinematography by Ragnar Westfelt Production company: Fürst-Film Copyright: Swedish Cinema Theatre Company, Oslo. There lies the Ré Valley. Remote and darkly forested, it is situated deep in the naked mountains. In the winter, the snow storm blows over the wilds... A moose lived there, which people called "The Wizard Elk". It was rarely seen by human eyes. And the belief started to spread through the village that it was the ghost of a dead man who had taken the shape of an animal - a human being in animal guise. The Wizard Elk's tracks were easily recognizable: The clefts spread out more than on other elks. Many a good shot hunted the Wizard Elk without luck. The most eager of them all was Sjur Renna, a husky wood cat of a fellow, nicknamed Gaupa (The Lynx) by the villagers. Gaupa's best friend and steady companion in the woods was the shaggy elk-hound "Bjönn" (Bear) Whoever shot the Wizard Elk would win great renown. But the foresters said that chasing the animal always resulted in ill luck. So things took a bad turn for Gaupa in the end. And his bullet had hit Bjönn instead of the elk. The same day, Gaupa was found by two foresters. The Lynx cabin lay lonely as a bear's lair in the woods. Gaupa almost died from the hunt. When he eventually recovered, he had turned "queer". This bullet had been used in the war, had killed a man and had remained a treasured possession in Gaupa's family since then. Gaupa didn't trace the Wizard Elk's tracks through the woods anymore. But so did the crofter's son, the strong and hardy Hans Trefothaugen. Sometimes Hans would come to the Lynx cottage. Gaupa would then tell in his strange, confused manner about this mysterious elk in the Ré Valley. Hans would often sit up and listen to Gaupa into the early hours. There was his home, the croft Trefothaugen... When Hans returned from a hunt, one could expect fresh meat on the table. Hans' mother, the widow Turi. There was a message from Rustebakke - tomorrow you must meet for required work. Rustebakke was the biggest farm in the region. The required work at Rustebakke was pure torture for a free roaming soul like Hans. I guess you're going up to the summer pastures with the cattle, Ingrid? Maybe we'll run into each other up there. Gunnar Sløvika was a rich horse-trader, and Hallstein Rustebakke would like him for a son-in-law. Gunnar Sløvika wants to buy Brownie from us, Ingrid! Like every bull elk, the Wizard Elk sheds its antlers in winter. ... but come summer it has'em again and ya never saw such antlers! Gaupa rarly fantasized about anything but Bjönn and the Wizard Elk those days. Often he would go to the woods looking for Bjönn, unable to understand that he was dead. In the mountain, Gunnar had his horses on pasture... Have ya seen Bjönn around? Do you think the carcass of that little mutt of yours is still roaming around! Gunnar's horses weren't pasturing far away from the Rustebakken cattle. Ingrid was staying in the cottage there. The farm hand Tølleiv thought himself something of a ladies' man. He thought that his chances with Ingrid were pretty good. Tølleiv got an "edge" off his enjoyment. Maybe Wolfie is thirsty? What is it? I forgot that you are Hallstein Rustebakke's daughter! I only care about you! The next day Rustebakke was crowded. Hallstein turned 50 years. Ingrid had left the cattle in order to assist. Hans and Gaupa had also come to the farm. Ingrid had asked them to come. Freeloader. That crofter's son thinks he's going to marry your daughter! If so, he'd have to shoot the Wizard Elk first! Gunnar gets hold of the shaft and pulls out Hans' sheathed knife... A couple of spectators observed what really happened. But they were Gunnar's friends. So they kept quiet. He's killing me! That's Hans' knife! It wasn't me! Run away, Hans! Get Hans! They're saying that I drew my knife on Gunnar Sløvika! But I didn't touch my knife, mom! Go to the city! Hasn't Hans been here? He went to Rustebakke today. We'll get the stabber! Isn't Hans here? You know where he went. Tell me, Turi! I love Hans, Turi! He has left for the city. The dance girl Bellina. The manager Piper, master of the tent and of Bellina The marksman's big number consisted in putting out the flames on the manager's three-branched candlestick with his bullets. Hans Trefothaugen had been hired as marksman by the manager Piper. Ingrid had made a decision.. I really want to make a trip to the city, dad! You still thinking about that stabber? I love him, dad! If you dare say that once more, I'll chase you off the farm. You don't have to chase me, I'll leave anyway! Then you won't set foot on this farm anymore! But Ingrid's feelings were strong and true. And her mind was strong and independent.. Let's stay friends, Bellina! Remember that you belong to me! Ingrid went to see a rich relative who happened to have a bad reputation.. Might I stay here for a while? I'm searching for someone I care about. When Bellina didn't care for Piper any longer, he sought comfort in drink. In Hans' bosom was a burning desire for Ingrid, for home, for the dark, whispering forests and the cool mountains. Time passed. Ingrid started to become a real city girl. Ingrid looked for Hans in vain. But her relative was helpful. and comforted her as well as he could. Don't be such a prude! Let's go and see the Texan marksman. The same evening... The market was closed for the evening... What's on your mind all the time? Enough! There's one person too many here! Ingrid had been aimlessly wandering the streets all day... The city became insupportable for Hans. He had to return to the woods and to Ingrid Ingrid longed home. She was a farmer's daughter and belonged on the sunburned estate at the foot of the mountains. Hallstein Rustebakke's lands were splendid and wide. But lately it was just like both he and the farm was gazing, waiting for something. And one day... Some time passed.. Hallstein saw that something was gnawing at Ingrid... In the woods... Hans had returned to familiar parts. He camped out most of the time, but sometimes he would stay with Gaupa. Gaupa was becoming increasingly worse - he was often obsessed by the idea of looking for Bjönn... Ingrid was at the Rustebakke cottage again. Ingrid! He saw her again for the first time! But as a killer and an outlaw, he didn't dare appoach her before she was alone. I feel strangely changed. It's as if something cleared up in my mind. I seem to have been absent for a long time. But now I remember it all.. .. and I can sense, that Gaupa will soon be leaving for other hunting grounds. If you ever get the Wizard Elk within range, use this cartridge with this bullet inside. Because it kills where other bullets won't. ..and watch out for that Gunnar Sløvika! Gunnar's alive? Gunnar got well. The villagers don't think you stabbed him any more. One who saw how things happened came clean about it. The night passed. The morning sun shone through the smoke vent in the ceiling. Anf while the winds blew lightly around the Lynx cabin, the old elk-stalker from Ré Valley drew his last breath. Hans' first thought was to go to the cottage where Ingrid was staying - he could do so as a free man now. And he would tell her that Gaupa had died. Ingrid was left alone at the cottage. It was the tracks of the Wizard Elk himself! With Gaupa's bullet in the barrel, he started the hunt.. The Wizard Elk was "standing" for Wolfie! Hans had to get within shooting range, before the elk ran off again. Then he'd have to shoot the Wizard Elk first! Now the road wouldn't be long to the Rustebakke cottage, to Ingrid! Having someone like that looking after one's daughter isn't bad! You once promised me something - if I was man enough to kill the Wizard Elk... Well, I shot it! When Hallstein Rustebakke makes a promise, he keeps it! The End Subtitles by knappen Proofread by knutten
