I don't want anything. I just want to share a news? What's the news? Your Joy got married in Delhi. What? Bye. I am still not aware about your planning. Sorry. You have sent Charki and Fulki by train. We guys have got seat here and our son and daughter got there. You don't think that the whole family should be altogether. You have been really an old person now. Who says? I am saying. When we were a new married couple... ...remember that time. What did you say? What? You used to say lets go somewhere alone. Sit alone, have food alone. That I want to say right now also. See our son is newly married now. Won't they sit separately now? Let them enjoy. Disgusting. Hey why are you crying? Don't talk to me. You have spoiled my life. Do I have spoiled your life? Your life was gonna spoil... You know after marring you I have saved your life. Saved my foot. You have spoiled all of my plans. Plan? Yes plan. Bijoy loves Julie and I love Shaan. But I could not say my father. According to plan Bijoy was supposed to be absent during wedding. And at the last minute of wedding. Shaan would come and propose to marry me. Oh my God. What a plan you guys had. Hey after that? After that? You are the main villain. You just came to marry in nice mood. Hey listen. I will never be your wife okay? You listen, I also will not be your husband too. Since my childhood... I have given my body, mind, thinking and all of my belongings to Priyanka. As you love Shaan, I also love Priyanka. Then why didn't you tell your father about Priyanka. Just like you as you could not be able to inform your father. My knees become out of my control before my father. I also could not able to inform afraid of his heart attacks. Then why are blaming me only? Here you are also culprit. Already I am half dead in tension. Now If Priyanka comes to know about this wedding... Palkiwala's son has escaped with my sister... And they have done registry also. And you guys are like watching movies. Is that in my face? Don't make me angry. My name is Patla Poda. Bring them here wherever you get them from. But boss. News is not confirmed. I have come to know from somewhere. So that I can also shoot you here. If anything goes wrong with Julie. So I will kill you all here. Find out everywhere. Try to know where they are. Hey sir. Hey Giridhari... how are you? Fine. Sir.. sir. He has come with his wife. What do you want? What you watch? Father it's not watch... It's what do you want. Don't stitching me. Father it's not stitching... It's teach. I know I know... Don't try to teach me English. That was slipped out by mistake. Who is she? But you know her. She is Julie. I love her that's why I have married her directly. But I am not gonna accept this indirect marriage. She is a Christian girl. Her elder brother is a mafia. He is a murderer too. Mother, Julie is a nice girl. You both can adjust with each other. I have been leaked because of you. I have lost my prestige before Raghab Roy. Why? Father as I love Julie, Tina also loves Shaan. You people got it wrong. Since I planned this one. Tina also could be able to marry could marry Shaan. And I have married Julie directly. Who is Shaan? Tina has not married Shaan, she has married Joy. - Joy? - Rajballabh has saved my prestige. That's why wedding was done in between Tina and Joy. Oh my God! That means everything is messed up here. Joy has suddenly changed his mind. Anyway, Julie you take blessings from my parents. Stay away. Get in. Get out! Out.. out. The terrace of this house is also not open for you. But father how could you? Today onwards I am not gonna grant you as my son. Don't late. Just pop out. Pop out. So heard everything. You went to create an incident and made an accident. For last two hours you have been sitting here. Do you want to wait any more or want to leave? I will wait for her whole life father. Why are you calling me father again? I am your unofficial father. Since your childhood you have done everything with my daughter. And married Raghab Roy's daughter. I never wanted to do this. My Hitler father did it forcefully. No one can force a person against his will. Actually the thing is if I could share each and everything with Priyanka... ...I could have felt relaxed. You just forget Priyanka and enjoy your happy married life. Ok. What's the name of wife. I guess Tina. Father you still have not driven out this guy. Get up, get out, get out I say. - Priyanka please listen. - Shut up. What Priyanka? Priyanka please listen to me at least. What should I listen? Tomorrow is your 2nd night of marriage. And you have come to explain. Just get out. Otherwise I will call the police. Hey no, no. I can go to the senior authorities also. - Get out, get out. Get out from here. - Priya. - Piku. Piku. - Get out. It's very much painful. Jokes apart I am blind also. I think that idiot Sumanta is the only left choice. Tomorrow is Joy's 2nd night of marriage. The end will come after that. Hey you. Are you inside this room? If you are here, please come out. Hey! Why are you hiding yourself here behind the bed? Hey be careful you will be murdered if you come forward. Don't forget I am his fiancée. Hey listen. I am also someone's fiancée okay? May be you are my wife. But don't have any interest to sleep on this bed with you. You don't need to worry. Please don't get excited. Don't try to act over-smart. If you really do this, trust will I will kill you with this knife. Hey you can't kill me with this butter-knife. Take it. It's a fruit cutter knife. You can kill me easily with this one. Hey take it. Hey.. hey... Still you don't trust me? Listen we both have to check out a plan. I promise to positively give you a divorce. Yes. I am a divorce specialist. I was never defeated. So don't get pressure. - So come. Let's sleep. - No, no. You cannot sleep on this bed. Then where will I sleep? Sofa. Sleep on this sofa. Take it. - May I switch off the light? - No. Come daughter in law. Sit here. My Joy is a very good son. He will impress you very soon. Look daughter in law. I am retired chief justice Rajballabh Chowdhury. Under my rules no one could try to do anything. My only son's wedding would be done in this way. I never expected that. That's why I will arrange a big get together party. Where the prestigious personalities will come from different corners of India. I will introduce you guys with them also. You guys are an ideal couple. Hey! Am I right? Hello Tina, this is Shaan, it is Shaan. Are you drinking? I am drinking. Last night you enjoy with your honey. Then what will I do on behalf of that? That's why I am drinking. So madam. How was your night yesterday? Shaan. He has not touched me yet. Oh God! What a holy lady! - He has not touched yet. - Shut up. Trust me. This guy is genuinely good. Oh really! You have come to know to that he is good in one night. So what did he do with you that I could not? Don't make me fool. Shaan. You know the situation how was. He has married in fear of his father... ...and I was afraid of my father's heart attack. One who gets one heart attack in a week, he should pass away definitely. At least problems could be solved after his death. What rubbish you are saying Shaan? Someone is knocking. No one. See your loving genuinely good Joy has come. May be he wants to taste his honey gain. Can you please stop it? Bye for now okay? Hello.. hello. Oh God. Hanged the phone. What are you doing with Chouki here? Where is Chouki? Here it is a bed. My name is Chouki madam. Good name is Chandan. I was born under a chouki that's why my mother has given me that name Chouki. I have not heard anything madam. I am going. What's now? Your father is calling a lot of people. That I really cannot tolerate. I'm gonna have phenol now. No.. no.. no one dies out of phenol, dies but half. Acid is better than phenol. So have acid please. What? You are suggesting me to have acid? I have not said that. Please keep quite. - Hello. - Hey Bijoy speaking. No, no that's my new number. Julie's elder brother is looking for us like a crazy dog. That's why I have taken a new sim card. Hey I have come to know from my father that... ...you have married Tina directly. I never wanted to do this bro. It was done to us forcefully. To save the prestige of your napoleon father. My Hitler father just has killed me. Bijoy! Where are you? I tried your number a lot. Tina! Are you okay? What okay? Just because of your unconfident friend everything has been spoiled. What was your Shaan doing then? He is just a nothing but useless. Don't use slang against Shaan. All discredits go to this Joy. Ok listen. His father is gonna arrange a get together party. If it really happens, we will be finished permanently. Pass the phone to Joy please. Look bro. Please do something. Do whatever. Listen Julie and me are going to Bangkok to save ourselves from her elder brother. You guys also come to Bangkok giving excuses of honeymoon. Bring Priyanka also. Shaan. Shaan also. Oh yes tell her to call Shaan also. Understood? It's okay. What happened? We have to leave for Bangkok, for honeymoon. What? Oh it's not like that honeymoon. Listen. Bijoy has planned something. You just call Shaan in Kolkata as soon as possible. He will stay at one of my friend's house. We will take Shaan with us also. But before that we have to manage Priyanka also. We will bring her also. Why? Why will I go to Bangkok? I am making it clear. Don't touch me. Priya please listen to me at least. You have married this girl. Now you are calling me Priya. Priya trust me. I love you only. Shame on you. You are talking like this in front of your new wife. A lot of days you entertained me. You also told me to wait here. Then how could you marry this girl suddenly? Cheater. One minute Priyanka. You don't know me. You are taking wrong. I am not Joy Chowdhury's wife. Oh God! Wearing all the symptoms like a married woman... You are saying that you are not Joy Chowdhury's wife. Who are you? How are you related to Joy? Listen this guys is nothing but just a puppet of his father. He has already spoiled my life, now it's your turn. Priyanka give me at least five minutes. I am explaining the full story before you. - Please listen. - Please listen. Tell me what's the story is. Actually I love Shaan. But in a great danger I had to marry him. Hey Vishnupriya, I can smell you. Do you have come? Where? But you guys have slept together too. Forget about sleeping, flower has not bloomed yet. I am telling you. I love Shaan only. He is my everything. Listen Priya. My father has arranged a get together. Before that we need to leave for a honeymoon. Honeymoon? You just have said that you are not couple. Then why is this honeymoon? Oh it's not like that kind of honeymoon. Then what kind of honeymoon it is? His father is gonna arrange a get together party. If it becomes true, we won't have any other option. I have infirmed Bijoy already. He will inform Shaan. We all go together. That's my Vishnupriya. Vishnupriya has come back to me. Leave her. Hey your mother has come back. It's my Vishnupriya. Leave her. Please give me a hug. Your mom has returned. This is my Vishnupriya. She is mine.

Your dhoti is like... coming out. Let remove everything. My get together party is almost ready. Bloody guy, always afraid of me, stammers before me. Now he is going to Bangkok. Okay your party is not going anywhere. You can rearrange the party after they come from honeymoon. No never. First party then honeymoon. Hey listen. - Listen very carefully what I am saying. - Tell me. You know how you had fixed that wedding suddenly. You just have put two unknown persons into a cage. In this situation both of them will not be happy during this party. Do you think will your party will be high then. Let them go for honeymoon and come back too. Then you will see how much successful your party will be. Not a bad idea. Give me that one. First honeymoon then party. Otherwise Joy will not enjoy the party. Instead of that he will behave like Debdas. I am sitting here like Debdas. When my Paro will come to me? Shaan! Who? What are doing here? Hey Mrs. Joy Chowdhury. Look at me... look at me very carefully. Paro... I have not gone to any Chandramukhi. I am in you, was in you, will be in you. What rubbish you are talking. Shut up. I have already shut up.

For Debdas no feelings, no regret... ...no love, no emotion, no affection at all. Everything is like... Who is this woman? I am Priyanka. We are supposed to get married. That day I also supposed to get married with Tina, but failed. Look, Mr. Shaan. Please don't break down. I have not broken down at all Mr. Joy. Just have cracked a little bit. Look, I am an advocate. Divorce Specialist. You can get Tina just after my divorce with Tina, and I will marry Priyanka. What a piece you are. Oh god! Two girls together. I am asking how was your last night?

And chief justice Rajballabh's son is going to airport by taxi. I can't take it. What are you saying? It's a minor matter. Should you be angry at this good time? - Better you give them your blessings. - Yes. Hey you Idiot. Come here. It's okay. It's okay daughter. - Okay fine. - Father. Listen.

Then you will understand what could be the main trouble. Let's go to Bangkok. Give it to me. See they've come. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - How're you? - Hi. - Hello - Shaan Hi! Fine, Bijoy, this is Priyanka. - Hello. - Hi. - How was the journey? - First class. We've come here, now what are gonna do? Now tomorrow we'll go to the court to file the divorce. Hey listen, that is not here, that would be in India. Oh My God! Then what are we here for? Let's go back to India. - Listen. - One minute? You've again boozed? Actually darling, yesterday my beloved Chandramukhi... ...had given a treat to her Debdas. Idiot. Okay fine, let's go. Let's freshen up. Yeah let's go, let's go. She is not going to understand. Ok bro, fine. Oh My God! There's a group of hunks. From my country, my people. All are hunks! Mr. Sakha, two more friends of mine and their wives have turned up... ...need two more rooms. Oh! You'll get it for sure. Is it Honeymoon? Yes, Miss Sakhi! Honeymoon! Oh! Mischievous guy, It's not Sakhi, it's Sakha. Tell me, who's going to perform Honeymoon with whom? Should that be informed to you, Mr. Sakha? OMG! This is the ritual... ...the one who are married, only they are allowed to do honeymoon. Isn't it? Now tell me who has married whom? Here, Joy is directly married to Tina. - And... - Oh, Got It. Mr. Joy and Tina in one room. And he and she would be in another room. No. I will stay with Tina. Yes. And Joy will stay with me. Why aren't you saying anything? Oh! Wish to have it from both ends? This is going to be a mixture in terms of residing. See, if there's so much confusion... ...then why not two boys and two girls in two separate rooms? We'll see to it. You just give us the keys. Just a minute. - Here it is. - Thank you. - Let's go. - Let's go. Oh God! These guys are really handsome. It would have been easy for me, if they stayed in separate rooms. Shit. Priyanka is accompanying Joy in his honeymoon? Yes. That's really weird. That means two heroines and one hero? And Mom, they were hugging while travelling. Shit. It seems that Tina is nobody. His everything is Priyanka. - Confusion. - What? Take the news. How would I take it mom? You convert yourself from a lawyer to a detective. Okay. Go straight away to Bangkok, and find out what is their real intention. Really Piku, didn't expect you to be so close to me. That you would return again, even after you're married. I was heartbroken. But I knew that I would get you back. I got you back but don't know for how long. I am really terrified you know. There has to be some blunders taking place. Don't worry. Of course need to worry. The way Joy wanted to live with you; I think you guys have already been in bed. Believe me, I might be married, but we were never together. He's very gentle. What? You're gentle? Mischievous guy no. 1. You intended to have fruits from both the trees. Leave the fruits, I didn't even have the grasses. - Did you ever allow me to have grasses? - Shut up! And if you talk about Tina... ...didn't even get to hold her, forget about having. What do you mean? I mean, I'm still a virgin. I don't believe you. - Believe me Piku! - Get Off! O Piku, I swear, I'm still a virgin. Come closer to me, My honey! No. Still you're officially a husband to some other person. Hence, I'm not going to sleep with you together in one bed. Why won't you sleep with me? Joy has said that we will divorce you. And after that we are going to marry. Then what is the problem to sleep in one bed? There's a problem. As long as we're not legally divorced, I can't sleep with you in one bed. What? Then where will I sleep? Under the bed. What? Why under the bed? We're officially husband wife. Moreover, we have the license. As long as you're parents and my elder brother accept it... ...I do not accept it officially. This is not right Piku, okay not in one bed, but please give me a kiss. No never. First with the kiss and then slowly everything, isn't it? No dear. I don't want anything else, just one... I said no... no means no. Piku ummmuh! "In the circus of mind, in the bypass of life." "No is there without you, keep that in mind." "Would become brave today, would switch on the mind AC." "Hold me tight, and pull me off!"

Hello, who's this? Uncle, this is Sumanta here from Bangkok. Bangkok? There my son has gone for Honeymoon. What the hell are you doing there? I have scooped everything out. What happened? Let me hear completely, then saying. I'm not getting anything. Your son is not in his honeymoon with his wife Tina. What not in the honeymoon? Then what are they doing? I mean he's in honeymoon with a girl named Priyanka. And your daughter-in-law Tina is spending nights with a guy named Shaan. My daughter-in-law? What happened tell me? Rubbish! Let me hear it completely. I think the guy, whose marriage you've been... ...his name is Bijoy and he's with a girl named Julie. Uncle, here there's a lot of confusion in terms of residing. Confusion? What happened tell me? Won't tell you. Won't. Will feed you completely. They don't know me what I can do now. What happened tell me please? Are they alright? That is what I'm trying to survey. Yes, got the line. Pick up the phone? Good morning. I mean good morning. Are you a boy or a girl? I'm the receptionist of Bangkok's playboy resort... ...and yes there's no room empty for the next seven days. Hanging down. Don't. Don't disconnect. My son Joy is in room no 616. His mobile is switched off. Give him the line. Ok giving. Your voice sounds like a thunderstorm. Hello. Your dad is in the line. Talk to him. Yes. Julie, your dad has called. I think he has accepted you. Strange! Not telling me anything. I'm really afraid now. Hello dad? Have you accepted? What should I accept my son? Shit, this is not my dad, this is Joy's dad. Who are you speaking son? Dad, I'm your son. Joy. Hmm. Where's my daughter in law? She is standing aside. Why are you sounding like this? This is definitely not my son's voice. No. I'm your son Joy. Actually I'm directly suffering from cough and cold. Directly? This is the way Bijoy speaks. Hello. How're you dad? Now you disconnect the phone directly my son. Shit, the case is now jaundice. Now I think Sumanta was right. Would you please tell me what have you come to know? First of all, I'll speak to Charan, and then will let you know. He is very happy dumping her characterless daughter Tina over my son. What is it? That means your daughter-in-law... ...in spending her nights in Bangkok with a guy named Shaan in the same room. What? Then my Joy? What is he doing? He's doing his honeymoon with Priyanka. - What? - Leave him. He's an idiot. But the main culprit is that Charan. I'm not going to leave him. I'll thrash him to hell. Oh my God! Hey, this is your phone. Hello. What hello? Hell with your hello. You've cheated me. Whom have you forced my son to marry? What? Joy is married to Tina. Don't you remember? Shut up. Got a news from Bangkok that Tina is roaming around with a guy named Shaan. - Shaan? - What happened? How does he get there? Don't pretend. You knew everything. Tina is a characterless girl... ...and that is why Bijoy ran away on the day of marriage. And you've created a drama to get my son marry that girl? When did I do that? You only forced your son Joy to marry Tina. I couldn't get your mischief. What do you think? I don't know anything? Your son Bijoy is now in Bangkok? Bijoy in Bangkok? Can't be. Pretending as if you don't know anything. Believe me Raju, I don't know anything. You come with me to Bangkok. I'll show you the proof live. And if this comes true, I'll put you and that heart attack master in jail. I'll surely come with you to Bangkok. But before that I'll sue that Raghab Roy. Hey Charan? What's up? Are you fine? You are a bustard. Nasty. Cheat. Hey! What're you saying? Don't get excited sir, or else it'll go high. Shut up. What shut up? Your daughter is an institute? Not institute? It's prostitute. Yes. Prostitute. Charan! Hey lower your voice. For you my friendship is cut off. Your daughter Tina is roaming about in Bangkok with a guy named Shaan? This can't be. I have the proof, Shaan is the guy of your locality. He used to mingle with Tina from before. You knew everything. You've hidden everything from me; I'm not going to leave you. Come to Bangkok. I'll show you live proof. - Okay. - Yes. Go ahead. Yes. You are Priyanka's dad, Dhanakrishna Dhali? Yes. Absolutely right? And you are Joy's dad. Yes, but you have not seen me before. No. I can't see. Yes I had heard from Joy that you can't see. Then how did you recognize me? With this, nose, two-in one. I can see with this nose and even smell too. Quiet. You're trying to go high being on a low category? I do not stay low, I pour, how would I go high? Shut up. My son Joy is married. You've insisted your daughter Priyanka to go behind my son? Is this your family business? Didn't get you. Don't pretend. You know everything. Joy is in Bangkok for Honeymoon and there... ...your daughter Priyanka is roaming with him. What? Why can't you control your bull, who's running after other girls? You're bad, your daughter is bad... ...your family is bad, and the ones who are gonna come in future... ...even they are bad too. Why are they bad? Because your daughter is running behind my bull. I don't believe you. First of all I'll see it with my nose then believe it. Is it? Then come to Bangkok with this nose of yours. Surely. But before that need Vishnupriya's permission? Vishnupriya, Vishnupriya. Vishnupriya, will I go to Bangkok? She has permitted. Great. Now let's go to Bangkok. Here is this Playboy Hotel. Get down fast. Shut up. Always work without planning. Sumanta is a kid. Based on what he has said, everybody has turned up. You should have investigated. Don't need your advice. I'm not here for nothing. Everything is your guess. Don't I know my daughter? Instead of arguing outside, let's go inside to get the news. - Exactly. - Now come. Madam, please dial nine for room service. Thank you. Hello. Welcome to Playboy Resort. What the hell is this saying? Bengali I guess? People of Nicaragua doesn't speak in Bengali. When speaking in Bengali, that means we're Bengalis. Hell. Oh My God! Yes hell indeed. Did you know none of the rooms were empty here. But a few moments back four rooms have been vacated. So how many do you want? Dear, is this boy or a girl? Mischievous aunty. We need four rooms. Hell. Oh my God! Everything with tight fitting. Now, fill this form up. I have something to ask before filling the form. Has anyone named Bijoy booked a room here? Not only Bijoy, Joy Bijoy and Shaan, three handsome guys... ...have booked a room and is spending honeymoon with their wives. Shaan? When did Shaan marry? Sir... Don't get excited. Your strokes have crossed century. Shut up doctor. It's my stroke, let me handle it. Okay, has any girl named Priyanka come here? That I don't know. The thing I'm interested in, can reveal that only. Mr. Gopal. This is the first time that my nose has betrayed me. What the hell is this? Leave it. Okay, where can we get them now? I mean, can you give us their room numbers? Of course I can, but they are not in their rooms right now. They have gone for an outing in couples. Very good. When they have gone out. They are bound to come back. We'll wait here and catch them red handed. We'll be waiting for them for so long? This is going beyond the limits. Not at all. Rajballav visits till the end, whenever he takes up anything. We'll take the news and then enter the rooms. No...can't agree to you every time. You're right. Take the keys, come to the room. Let's freshen up first, and then do whatever you like. - Okay. Let's do it. - Let's go. Give the keys. Form the signature. Here it is. The keys. Okay. Let's go. Everyone is in their rooms. But where's mine? Vishnupriya. Please help me. Vishnupriya. I can smell Vishnupriya here. Vishnupriya. Vishnupriya. Hey Mr. two in one. Who's this? Oh, Mr. Raghab. Yeah, this is not your room. It's more ahead. Thank you. Since I have the two in one, I'll find it out myself. Thank you sir. See this boy. This is Sumanta. We've come here, based on his news. Hello to all of you. We take the hello, but not the news. Are you speaking the truth or lying? Oh my God ! Why should it be a lie? I've even found out something new. See there. Patla Poda. He is in search of Bijoy and Julie. So he is Patla Poda? "His day or my day"? What? I'll scoop him out. Don't go, where are you going there? He is a bad man. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey Mister? You're Patla Poda? Your sister has insisted my son to run away. I'm out of prestige because of you. Oh my God! In front of whom do you resemble yourself as Don? That means out of prestige. You are Haridas Palkiwala? No. I mean Charandas. Father of a characterless son. Mind your language. It's because of your sister that my prestige has gone down. Let me get hold of your son once... ...and then I'll show you where your prestige would be. Will scoop you out. Oh my God ! This is going beyond the limit. After all, they are legally married Mr. Patla? Hey, It's Patla...Got it? I don't go by that registry. I don't get the son, then will fire the dad out. See Mr. Patla. All of us, are in the same trouble now. Everything is confusion here. That is exactly why I have got hold of all the dads. Uncle, the news of confusion is already leaked from the reception itself. That Joy, Bijoy and Shaan are residing in their rooms, along with their wives. But all the wives have changed. They would turn up after a while. So see it for yourself. We need to plan up everything. You're right. If I am talking... Do you know why we are here? They are about to return now. Will catch them red handed. But what I think is, yeah look there. We need to focus on everything. Where will you run now? Hey, what're you doing? Leave her. Uncle, you? Yes, it's me. You've come too. What to do? Had to come to witness such a case of confusion. My son and daughter in law are here for honeymoon. What're you doing here? Getting fried? Priyanka. Who're they? Uncle, this is my would be husband. We're here for a honeymoon. What rubbish? You and Joy? Yeah... I work with Joy. He's my boss. And they're Joy's parents. Parents of Joy? Yes. But uncle, why're you here? To check that how's your son performing? Yes. No respect for elders? Why should I be interested in that? I'm here to know who's my son doing honeymoon with. Why? He's doing honeymoon with the one whom he has married. That means, Joy and Tina? Let's go. Let's go for a pre honeymoon. Bye uncle. Bye Aunty. Pre honeymoon. Would be husband. What nonsense is this? Can't get it at all. You don't need to even. Would have been better in your age. What rubbish? Nowadays everything is in due slip. It's Priyanka's phone. Hello Priyanka. Where're you? Tina and me are entering the hotel. No, no, back off. Don't enter. Why? What happened? Joy's dad. Joy's dad? Where? Inside. Inside? Inside the hotel. Oh my God ! We're finished. How did he come here? I guess Sumanta has informed. Sumanta? What happened? Joy's dad has come. How did he come here? Daddy? Who's daddy? My dad. Where? In front of me. Bye! How many marriages would you do? Idiot? Why're you roaming around with Joy's wife? Daddy, this is Shaan's wife? I mean Joy's wife. My wife is Julie. But dad, why're you here? Wait. I will tell you. Listen. Listen! - Bijoy. - Come and see him. - What would happen now? - See what they're doing! Got Palkiwala's son. Hey. - Run, run. - See the condition of your son. Where have they gone? Yes, yes, got him. Whom have you got? Bijoy Palkiwala right? I'm not the one whom you're looking for. The guy with your sister Bijoy Palkiwala is playing hide and seek there. - Is it? - Yes. Let's see. Find out lad. Bengali in Bangkok? He must be the son of Palkiwala. Fooled me. Where's he? Where's he? Where's he? Now where to find Tina and Joy? The fact is very thrilling. Yes. Here. Here is my son-in-law. - Isn't it? - Yes. But who's the girl beside him? Superb right. Caught you. Dad? You? Your Dad? My dad's dad? I mean my father-in-law. Are you fine dad? You would be responsible for my next heart attack and death. Why dad? You've married my daughter, but here with some other girl? She is not girl dad? Don't teach me who's a girl or a boy? She's Julie. Daughter-in-law of Charan Das. Then what are you doing with the daughter-in-law of Charan Das? Talking to her then will go to my wife. I mean to your daughter. Everything is smelling confusion. What's the matter? Walking around silently since then? Yes. What I can assume, it seems there's a big case going around. Need to poke my nose in this now. Where would you poke your nose in? I will go to Joy's room tomorrow morning to find who he is staying with. What's wrong with you? You are his dad right? Being a dad you would watch your son doing that? No other option left for me Priyambada. No other option left. If I don't enter, I won't get any proof and won't be able to shut the case. - What? - Yes. Will definitely enter. Where're you going? To open the door. No, no. Don't open the door. Why? It must be bed tea. Can be your dad too. You run away. For that need to open the door. Hide, hide, hide. - What're you doing here? - Yes ! I've seen, your dad is knocking the door. Now what should I do? Do one thing. Get underneath the bed, and I'm sleeping on the bed. Priyanka, you open the door. Go, go. Uncle, you? Good morning. Have come here to see whether the morning is good or bad. Coming to Bangkok and playing fool. Who's this? Would be husband. Didn't I tell you? Pre-honeymoon! Yes right. Then where's Joy and Tina? 601. 601. Come out. Thank you Shaan for saving me. What save? Run for Tina's room immediately. Why should I go to her room? Idiot, when your dad will not find you in 601... ...then there would be a very big case. Right. Don't go through the main door, or else you will be in trouble. Do one thing. The way I have entered, you go in the same way. Okay. But what'll you do? I'll stay with Priyanka. Go fast. Shaan don't pluck flowers from my garden. Go. Listen Joy. My garden is now in your safe hands. Oh my God! Be careful. Be careful. Oh God! Be careful. Dad you? Good morning dad. You in this hotel? Where's Joy? Why dad? Is anything wrong with mom? When did you arrive? I want to know where's Joy? He's sleeping right there. Who's there darling? Dad has arrived from Kolkata. Shut up. Don't lie in the morning. Why should he be here in our honeymoon? Just have a look if you don't believe? Dad? Dad you're here? Yes it's me. Where's mom? She's in this hotel itself. But why? Don't find necessary to tell you that. Will tell the right person. Where's Shaan? In my garden. Uncle, uncle, uncle, uncle. Hey dear, I was looking for you. Caught them red handed? Yes. Absolutely. Would like to give you a gift red handed. You slapped me? Don't you dare to inform wrongly in future... ...else you would severely be punished. I've seen it myself that Joy is with Tina. They are fooling you. Joy is with Priyanka. Shaan is with Tina and Bijoy is with Julie. Uncle, you didn't believe me... ...but I swear on the name of my dead father, I'll give you the right proof. When I've come here, I'll get a glimpse of my daughter. Yes. You are here? That's what my question is. What're you doing in this hotel? This is my daughter's room. Dad? You're here? Hey what're you doing with my daughter in one room? Again stroke, again stroke. This is Stroke number 102. Dad? Dad? Dad? - Dad? - Are you alright Dad? Who? Who're you? It's me Joy. Your son-in-law. But where's the other one? Who dad? Who turned me to score 102? Whom are you talking about dad? You fainted in my arms. Yes dad. So this stroke of mine was like no ball? Now should I consult for a courier service? Are these photos transposed? What're you saying sir? You're a retired chief justice. Rajballabh Chowdhury. It's not that easy to make you a fool. Aunty, I felt down from the sixth floor while clicking the photos. Got it. But what is your benefit in this? I am in loss. But only you can make my dream successful. Didn't get that. But tomorrow I'm gonna summon all three of them and close this case. Then mine would be open. - What? - Luck. I just can't believe that they can do such a stuff. That scoundrel Shaan have instigated my daughter. Don't get excited sir. But I haven't seen. But could understand through smell, that there's indeed a big confusion. I'm not going to leave that Palkiwala's lad. Six of you have fooled us around. And now have come out of your disguise. Now take a look at my decision. - Dad? - What dad? Leaving your own wife... ...you're flirting around with the daughter of that Dhanakrishna Dhali? You have ruined my prestige. Uncle? Shut up. You are just like your dad. No why should only girls be responsible? Why can't the bulls be tightly controlled? You shut up. Forcing your daughter to run behind my son, and now talking rubbish? Can't you control, the way I'm doing it. I can control. Stupid Idiot, You've created a mess out of my arranged marriage? See.. This is the way to be controlled. I'm showing it too. - Such an idiot would be my son-in-law? - It's hurting uncle. Volume decreased sir. You shut up. What did you think, should I let my daughter come to you? Before that I should have committed suicide. I can handle that but before that kindly accept me as your son in law. Shut up. Don't you dare to call me father. Hey, now you're finished, son of Palki! We're married. And your sister would become widow if anything happens to me. I'll definitely shoot you. Stop Poda. Bijoy is my only son. What is he doing? Shoot me on his behalf. No! No! In my back. Please don't shoot him. I don't want to be a widow. Bro, you shoot me, that can handle this situation . Is it a game or what? Charan is responsible for all this. If you would have told me on the day of marriage... ...that the daughter of Raghab Roy is a characterless... Mind your language Mr. Gopal. Don't talk rubbish about my daughter. And what is your son? Innocent? Saint? Correct. It's all your fault Raju. My son has fled away so what is your problem? Why did you let Joy marry Tina like this? Correctly said. Charan? I wanted to help you and you're putting me into trouble? I'll see you out. Mind your language. You mind your language. You don't know what I can do to you. I can sue you here. Even I won't spare you. I'll do the same with you. This idiot is responsible. - You called me an idiot? - Yes. So? Then you are a bull pig. Again confusion? Who's she? I'm Sumanta's Mom. I promised to get my son married to Priyanka. And you've made that easy. Sumanta! Yes, I'm here. - Do what I had said. - Yes but what Mom? Stupid, kidnap Priyanka and flee away. Please come with me. Take me along with you all. Since I can smell and find out. It's the radar. Come on let's go. Leave me rascal. Hey, where're you taking my chick away? Sir. Yes. The scene resembles that the villain is... ...bringing the heroine and coming through this way. Okay the people who would chase them would be attacked by the fighters. Okay this is the scene. - Okay Master. Let's shoot. - First class. - Ready. Standby. Position - Camera everything ready? Come on. Okay. - Yes, ready. - Roll camera? Action... Leave me. I'll show you now. Who're all these? Behind this mess is Sumanta. Dacoits brought by Sumanta. Let's run. Stop. Stop. - Sorry. Sorry. - Stupid! Who're you all? Why're you beating us? Who are they? Wait. Here it is and give it to me. What is happening here? Hey, he is Priyanka's father. Priyanka.. Priyanka.. Priyanka.. Leave her. Hey listen. Run! Wait for me. - Hey you. - Come on. Hurry up! Sorry. Why did you give me money? Am I a beggar? What are you doing? Oh, my God! Why do you hit me? Patla Poda. Cut. Cut! Cut! Cut! Who the hell yelling out cut? Who's gonna cut whom? Mister this is a shooting zone. Here there was a shoot for my film. And you guys have created a mess out of it. Who is he? - Are you Raj Chakraborty? - Yes. Hello. Hello. But what's the case? Stop it. See, the son-in-law's are not guilty. What are you saying? All the son-in-law's. Please come here. Don't mind, Mr. Rajballabh, Mr. Patla Poda, Raghab Babu. Talking to you later, Mr. Charandas. All are your faults. How could that be? Don't angry me. Patla Poda can never make mistakes. Are you getting married? No. Then let them be happy with whoever they feel like. Will you please be clear? You got your son married to someone whom he doesn't know. You are right. Patla, do you love your sister? Of course. But do you know whom sister Julie loves? Love can't be fired with a gun. You are hundred percent correct. Raghab Babu, you've pretended as a heart attack patient... ...and got your daughter Tina married to Joy. But your daughter Tina loves Shaan. And Mr. Charandas you still believes in religion at this era? If your son can marry a Christian girl... ...and live happily then what is your problem? See, Mr. Raj we realize that we've made a mistake. But what's the solution now? Let your son Joy, divorce Tina. Tina would marry Shaan then. And Joy would marry Priyanka. Then what about me? See Mr. Sumanta, love can't be achieved forcefully. - Mother! - Calm down. See Mr. Raj it was not right to get my daughter married to Joy. But from now on, let's move on with their wishes. Accept them Parvati. But her elder bro is a dacoit. I quit that from today onwards. I swear on my sister. I won't do anything wrong from now on. Don't punish my sister for my mistake. And you misunderstood me. Instead of saying Pi Pi Pi, if only you said that you love Priyanka... ...then everything would have been fine. Always giving the lecture. Stop lecturing and come to a solution. - The solution has been given by Mr. Raj. - What? Joy would divorce Tina and marry Priyanka. And Tina marry Shaan. - Hey Mr. Dhanakrishna? - Yes. You are right. Nobody can change whatever is destined. That's right. All is well that ends well. Charan, you are right. This is the first time you've said a correct English. Now what? Don't you have anything to say? Yes we have. Our father-in laws thought that their son-in-law's are fraud. Are you thinking the same? Son-in-law's can never be fraud, and ours are certainly not. "Disguised as Son-In-Law, I have come." "I have come, I have come." "I have listed the number of gifts I'll get." "I have listed, I have listed." "Disguised as Son-In-Law, I have come."
