Relax, this is just practice. Practice? We've practised hundreds of times. And you still can't beat me? You're such a show off. Madi, you have to remember,... ...you need to practice even harder, okay? You're not a street racer anymore. I've left all of that behind me. When I met you back then, I promised... ...that I wouldn't join illegal race anymore. That's my champion. Thank you, Roy. Is that him? -That's him. Why can't you go fast going downhill? I can't be fast? Hey. Are you Madi? Yes, I'm Madi. Are you looking for me? If we weren't looking, we wouldn't be asking. If you're looking for trouble, this isn't the place. Who says we're looking for trouble? Can we get a selfie? We just want a selfie. Sure. Smile! One, two..... Thank you. Thanks. -When's your next race? My next race is next week. I'm training now. If you're free, come watch. How can we not? Of course we'll come! Okay. Thank you. -See you again! They're just fans. -You have fans, I see. Not bad. What a bother. I'm tired. -What's wrong with you? If you're sleeping all day, how will your business succeed? Where's the bike you wanted me to look at? At the back. If it was here, I would've said here. You sleep at home and at the workshop. What is your life purpose? I have to take care of my kids at home. I take care of my wife, I cook,... ...I entertain the kids, the wife. Make more of them. Then I come here and I have to entertain customers and smile. It's tiring, you know? People get married, and you want that too. And then you chose to marry my ex-girlfriend. Madi! Is that yesterday's drink? It's the only one here, might as well drink it. Go buy another! You should help me fill up the fridge instead. I mean, you're going to fill up the space in this house anyway. Dream on. Roy, hurry up. The British Grand Prix is about to start. Hold on. Roy, hurry up! You don't have to shout. Your house isn't that big. To the right. You have it with you right, Macha? Then you should go get it! Why must I do it? I have to get it, I have to race, and I have to set things up? What is this? Are you blind? What's your deal? Sorry. It was just a slight bump. Was it accidental or was it on purpose? I've said sorry. What's the big deal? Nuisance. This is your fault, Macha. Because I'm on the phone with you. I'll call you back later. Do this with your arms. Legs out. So when you enter a corner, you can balance like that. Okay? Yes, like that. Practice that. Why are you late? -I went to pick up some stuff... ...for the race next week. Guys, ready? -Coach. Where are your helmets? We left them. -It's okay. Start your engines. It's raining. Madi! What do you want? I'm fixing my bike here. Why bother me? There's a race tonight. What race? -The guys have set up a game. The usual hangout spot. It's been a while since we do. You have to go out once in a while. I can't. I don't do those things anymore. Come on. I have practice tomorrow and that's more important. Tell the other guys to do the work. It's okay. I'll do it. Okay, then. You do it. Are you scared of Roy? -She'll hit me with the wrench. My wife is here. Do your work. You need to focus on the race. That's the most important thing. Practise well. Why? So you can focus to win. Okay. -I'll do my work. I can't go out at night too. -True. Love! My darling love,... ...my snoogums-boogums. It's lunch hour. I cooked something special for my beloved. Every day is a special day, as if any day is my birthday. Of course! -There's an orange. What a big orange. -Let's eat. Hold on. Madi, want to join us? It's okay. Enjoy your meal. Baby love my dear,... ...I'm washing my hands because they're dirty. Then I'll perform ablution just so we can break it. Okay. -Alright. Hurry up, babe. I'm hungry. Hi, Ika. -Hi, babe. Hi, Madi. -Can I have some fruit? You never changed, do you? I thought being old would change you. But you're still the same. What a flirt. I mean this fruit. You're lucky my baby's here. Otherwise... ...you'd be in trouble. I can't leave you both alone at all. Baby, what are you doing? Let's eat together. I broke my ablution. Oh, you. -Let's eat. Let's go. Not here though. You enjoy teasing Ika, don't you? Do what? -Did you miss... ...being cheeky with your ex-girlfriend? Why? Are you jealous? Jealous? Dream on. "Jealous? Dream on." Hi, guys. Welcome back to my channel. Right now I'm at the "mm" workshop. MM. -I mean MM Workshop. I don't know what's wrong with my motorcycle today. Sorry. So, if all of you... ...want to know what's wrong with my motorcycle,... ...just stay tuned, okay? It's heavy. So heavy. -To the left. This is really exhausting. Side stand. -Okay. As soon as you see the mechanic coming in,... ...record them straight away. Yes. -Will do. Madi! You're Madi, right? The street racing legend of old! The one that everybody talked about. Goodness! Record it. Do you think it's easy to meet Madi? Wait. It died. Oh no, why did it die? It's okay. Calm down. Come on. -Ta-da! You're loaded. -We make a lot of money. Madi. What's wrong with the bike? -Yes. Bike. I don't know. Actually, earlier this evening,... ...I tried to start it. But when I did,... ...it didn't have a bike sound, but more like... ...crickets chirping. Something like that. Are you a reporter? -No. Then what is all this? -This? We are YouTubers! YouTubers? -Yes. Vloggers. You don't know what YouTubers are? Poor you. I have many subscribers. This bike? I didn't need to buy it... ...by doing all these hard work. No need. I just used my YouTube money. Amazing right? -That's good. If you want to film me,... ...you can put the camera over there. Here? -Take it from this angle... ...so we can see the machines and the bike. What a request. Cool. That's nice. Would it be okay for us to do a bit of interview? What interview? Come on, man. If you appear in our video,... ...it will definitely get so many "li-kes" Hey. It's "Likes". Not "Li-Kes". "Likes". We will get so many likes. Come on. Okay, sure. While you do the interview,... ...I will fix your motorcycle. Thank you! Okay. Madi. Did you know? I've been keeping up with your progress. From the time you were a nobody... ...to where you are now. You couldn't even carry the motorcycle before. I've been following your journey. From the time you joined that "chooprix". That was amazing. -Hey. "Cub" Prix. Cub. Cub Prix. You're amazing. The question is, what is the definition... ...of success to you? Success has no definition. When you succeed, you will be the definition. That's so deep, guys! Awesome. -I don't regret being a fan! Ask him more questions! -I'll ask him. Hold on. The second question. This is more challenging. Could you help me take a look at these YouTubers' bike? You what? Just one more. Sure. Share your YouTube money with me... ...and we'll do another interview. What to do? -Let's interview this guy. Shuib! Rudy, can you call Madi? Does he think my uncle owns the track? Hey! What's your deal? What? Are you mad you lost the other day? Of course! If you have the guts, let's go! This is 125Z! I have no time to entertain newbies like you. No time or too scared? Aren't you a champion? Okay. Let's go. Aren't you a champion? Hurry up. It's taking too long. Acting like he's in a rush. Does he think his father has a share on this track? I went through trouble to rent it,... ...and he just takes his own sweet time. He's late too. Madi. Tell me, where were you? Did you know that I rented this track for RM6,000? That's three months' worth of your salary... And you do this? You only have 15 minutes left to use the track. I've been here since morning. Tell me now,... ...where were you? I had a race just now. You did? Where? Those Spark kids. They were harassing me. Spark kids? Did you win or lose? Madi, did you win or not? I bet he lost. Try to finish in less than a minute, okay? We've dyno-tuned the bike. Just focus on your riding technique. What did you say just now? He used to be fast in the past. But who can challenge my bike now? No one. But he's different now. Those who race in the streets are considered newbies. It's different now. You have to join the Cub Prix. Prepare my bike. Why? What are you going to do? Spark has just found his spark. How much longer must I spend in here? I want to see my old friend. Who are you looking for? -Madi. Madi! This kid is looking for you. Why? Do you want my autograph? Do you already have an answer? Still thinking about it. You're taking too long. How many girls have you slept with anyway? How would I know? You're the one sending them to me. He looks Caucasian. As far as I know, my girls are purely Malays. Muhammad. Muhammad. Madi. Can I ask you a question? -What? If Madi really is your father,... ...do you have proof? Go inside. Where should I sit? Sit on that sofa. Here. Get some sleep. Don't be such a baby. Make yourself at home on the sofa. Don't ever come to my room upstairs, dude. My teacher says not to use the word "dude". Then what should I call you? -Muhammad. Suit yourself. Go to sleep. Madi! What now? I'm hungry. There are fruits in the fridge. Take whatever you want. I can't sleep if I'm hungry. Eat the fruits, then! -I don't want it. Let's go out to eat. -Hold on. What now? I need to take a shower first. Eat first, shower later. No. I need a shower now. Where is the bathroom? Over there. What a nuisance. What do you want? You've been staring at the menu. Can you read? I'm looking for something Western. I want pasta. Goodness. You're demanding. There's no pasta here. Only fried noodles. I want to ask. How's Madi? Don't say his name. It's embarrassing. I was leading by three miles. I waited so long at the top. His face when he arrived... ...really resembled the tar road. So embarrassing. Feed me. No. Use your own hand. Is your mum well? Where is she now? You are tardy. You seem happy. Of course. I have a message for you. You have to prepare Spark's bike. I have other matters to settle. What matters? Don't ask. The important thing is, disaster is coming. Disaster? -It is coming. Muhammad? Muhammad. Are you not going to wake up? Muhammad At Age Three Hey! What are you doing? I'm not doing anything. You're not doing anything? Don't ever go in there. This is a motorcycle garage. Not a playground for kids. Whose motorcycle is that? That's not a motorcycle. -Then? That's scrap metal. Don't. Come here. Don't go in there again. Let me tell you something. I have a race tomorrow. I don't want you to come along. You can stay with Roy. But I want to come along. You never listen, do you? I don't want you to come along. Do you understand? This toy bike is no fun, right? -No. Look. Want to try real scramblers? -Yes. May I? Yes. I'll teach you. Okay? Yes. -Come on. Macha. -Madi. Where's your son? Can you stop calling him my son? But he is, right? I'm not used to it. No one came looking for the boy at all. Just take care of him for now. Someone will claim him sooner or later. Can't you do that? If none came? Then raise him yourself. He's yours, right? You made him, you take care of him. What kind of human are you? You are so confident that the kid is mine. You have the same looks. You even have the same pose. Look. Like father like son. Who is that? Hey. -Macha! Ali. It's so hot. Look at you now. Madi. Are you well? -Praise be to God. Are you well? -I'm okay. You keep appearing on television. Movies. Dramas. But not on radio yet. -That's right. Do you need your bike fixed? -No. I came with news. What news? I went to our usual spot last night. As usual. Hanging out, relaxing. But there were Spark's boys there. They were talking about Madi. Why talk about me? -Don't pretend you don't know. You lost the race, right? -Then what do they want now? Here's the thing. They'll hold an open race tonight. They want to challenge you. I would say yes if I were you. -Me too. It's Madi we're talking about. If you don't do this,... ...then I will. Think about it. What is this place? This is called a funfair. This funfair is funny. This is not a funfair for you. This is a funfair for adults... ...like Madi. Then why bring me here? Then with whom should I leave you? Roy. Muhammad, don't say Roy's name. Make sure Roy doesn't know I came here. The problem is, where is Ali? He doesn't keep his promise. This is not the guy I'm looking for. If you've lost, act like it. Relax. If you want to start a game, do it properly. You don't go challenge people on the highway. That's illegal. Scared of a little surprise? We can play legally, no problem. Let's do it tonight. See who wins or loses. The rules are simple. No wheelies. One versus one. Would that be okay? -That's alright. No problem. -Game on! It's on! Muhammad, wait here. Move! Madi! Oh no. Stop! Stop, everybody! Muhammad, hurry! What happened? Goodness! Don't tell me you brought him to a race. Madi, you promised me. You promised you wouldn't join illegal races anymore. Do you even think? What if anything happened to you? If you died, or you got arrested? Stop lecturing me. Let's treat the kid first. -Why bring him here for that? Bring him to the clinic. Are you mad? What should I tell the doctor? I fell because I got chased by the police? Excuses. Give it here. -No! I know it's hard for you to accept Muhammad. But he's already here. You need to learn to accept him. He is your responsibility. Hear me? That. Clean that wound up. I'm leaving. Good morning. Come. Let's eat. Does it still hurt? If it hurts, you just rest. Don't do any work. I don't have work. What I mean by no work is... ...don't watch the TV. Don't read the comics. Just rest until the wound healed. Okay? Feed me. Not like that. Then how? Where's the sound? Go, Muhammad! Go, Muhammad! You've trained him well! Go, Muhammad! Yes. Right. Hello? Okay, sir. Thanks. One more. -Macha. Cub Prix is creating a new category... ...for its final race. What category? The Legend Race category. My name is on it as well. Imagine, I'll be racing with all the Cub Prix legends of Malaysia. What motorcycle? -125Z. 125Z? Hey, Rudy! -Yes. Where can we get 125Z? A lot of our members use them. Parts? -Nowadays,... ...everything is PnP. PnP! What is that? -Plug and Play. Ready to race. Sorry. It's ready to race. Madi is racing. -Muhammad, I'll be racing. Are you happy? Here. Me too. Boss. Are you well? -Good. Spark. Enjoy the fresh air. It's fresher inside. It's a furnace in there. No. It's fresher out here. This is for you. RS jet rod. It's better. This will be exhilarating. Madi, can I have two ringgit? Why do you keep asking for two ringgit? It's just two ringgit. Hey. Why open that? Why is the bike looking like this? This is all history that I want to forget. Why not fix the bike? Muhammad,... ...there are things that you can't fix. Some things, you need to forget. So, why leave the bike here? You should repair it. I want to see it. It sounds awesome. Spark Racing Team. Welcome back! Exciting. -Not bad. Boss, is it exciting? Exciting. -Come sit down. Treat it like your own shop. It is your shop. Enough with the small talk. I just want to know where Ismadi is. When I heard the son-of-a-gun joins the Cub Prix... ...my pulses were all... ...boiling to burst out. Why is that? Spark, here's the thing. My boys were talking about it. They said he's training hard for the Legend Race. A legend? Does he think he is one? This is the true legend. Still fresh and piping hot. The furnace. Spark. The legend... ...of..... Boss. I was kidding. Is my bike here? Your bike? You should have asked earlier. The bike is ready. Everything is okay. Don't worry about that. What you need to know and think right now... ...is the Spark Racing Team. BGH 9234. What are you going to do with this junk? I am going to use it for the Legend Race. Seriously? That junk? Yes. Muhammad wants me to fix it. I am sure I can win the race with this bike. Madi, seriously,... ...this is like trying to restore a new bike. Our boys have a lot of two-stroke bikes. You can just borrow them. This is a lost cause. Macha. Remember, you owe me one. You left the kid that night just like that. I'm sorry. I was surprised... ...that the police came. Whenever they come, I'm gone. That's why I forgot about Muhammad. I will apologise to him. Muhammad,... ...I want to apologise to you... ...for leaving you... ...at the funfair spot last time. If that happens again in the future,... ...if you get left behind, then do this. I will teach you. Roll it and then..... Stop teaching the kid ridiculous things. This is not ridiculous. This is the time for it. When else can I do so? Is it like this? Madi, I helped bring the bike. Two ringgit, please. Why do you keep asking for two ringgit? What for? It's just two ringgit. Where did he learn that? Hey, what is your deal? Those are Spark boys' bikes. Spark? Why are you here? I am here to see an old friend. Oh, Madi. I missed you most when I was in jail. I'm sorry. I have no time to miss you. So the evidence can still be used? BGH 9234? Go away. I don't have time for you. Okay. I am not planning to fight here. I'm here to tell you some news that might excite you. I'm not interested. -You have to be interested! Greetings and peace be upon you. We are here... ...at the Terengganu Gong Badak International Circuit. A circuit of 1.35 kilometres. Eight turns and nine straight roads... ...that all racers will go through. What happened? This motorcycle is bad. There's a problem with air intake. Pump some air. -Wan, check the airflow! Come on. A road this big, and yet he still wants to hit me. What a jerk. The racers are getting ready... ...to move towards the starting square of the race. Our attention is on two racers, number 69 and 77. Izwan Ismail and Ismadi Ibrahim. For the Petronas Malaysian Cub Prix Championship 2020. We will soon witness... ...the Legend Racing 125Z. Everyone is ready now. What's interesting about this category is that... ...they are using 125Z machinery. It's a two-stroke vehicle... ...that has been used for a long time. And we've now moved to a new direction... ...which we call the Legend Race. The 4th and 9th boxes... ...are attracting our attention. Spark and Ismadi. They've begun the race. A good start for Obert and Zamri... ...heading toward the first turn to be ahead of others. Let's see the placement for numbers 69 and 77. Spark and Ismadi... ...who are at the centre of this group. As you can see, Obert is still leading the race. And Amin in second place,... ...while Zamri in third place,... ...while Spark in fifth place at the moment. Where is Ismadi? At the bottom, in eighth place. Behind Elly Jr. We can see, Ismadi was having a bit of a problem... ...but he successfully crawled his way back... ...to get back into the rhythm... ...or the racing line which he was supposed to be in. Seven more rounds before the finishing line. It is tough for Ismadi to catch up now. A rider is down. This is happening at the back. Let's draw our attention to the racers ahead... ...with Obert in the first place. Amin in second, while Spark in third. Madi is trying to catch up, to get behind Spark. But Spark is in third place now. It is between the two racers, Madi and Fazli Shah. Everything is on Fazli and Madi. Madi has raised his hand. Ismadi has won the race,... ...with Fazli Sham in second place... ...and Izwan Ismail, also known as Spark... ...in third place. What is the kid to Madi? Spark. That kid is his son. He's playing a different field, I see. Why wasn't I aware of this? Ajak? -I..... I forgot..... -Spark. Ajak, let me go before I beat your face up. Spark. It seems that Muhammad is really bonding with you. He is my son, right? So,... ...do you have any plans for Muhammad? None. I'll focus on Asia Road Race for now,... ...and then we'll see how it goes. What's clear is that Muhammad will stay with me. What if someone comes to take him? Why would they leave him if they want to take him back? I'm glad to hear that. Are you okay with Muhammad staying here? With us? I like that. I'm okay with it. It seems to me... ...that he's exactly like you. He has the racer's blood in him. Besides,... ...he looks happy here. Muhammad? Get up. So this is where he learned that from. Muhammad,... ...this is the biggest race of my life. When I ride past you, give me your loudest cheer, okay? If you win, can we go on trips? Even if I don't win, we can still do that. Madi, I'm going over there and check out those girls. Let me bring all of them. Macha, wait. I need the loo. Stomach ache. Keep an eye on Muhammad. Keep an eye on him. -Wait there. Muhammad, let's go. When is it going to start? It's taking so long. Relax. Let's wait for Roy. We will watch the racers later. I want to watch them too. Macha! Ready? Okay, one, two,..... Okay. Smile. Okay. Another one down here. Hey. Are you from Japan? The Philippines? Let's go. Where's Muhammad? Come on. What a flirt. -Muhammad? He's here. He was here. Macha, where is Muhammad? -Over there. Where did you leave him? -He's over there. Seriously, Macha. -He really is. Let's go see him. He's there. Madi. What? Is Muhammad with you? What's going on, Macha? I left him with you. He's missing. The race is about to start and you're saying he's missing? Go look for him now! -Relax, Madi. Give your phone to Madi. -What about Madi? Don't call me now. Who's that? -I don't know. Right now, your son is with me. Don't you dare do anything to him. Understand? I won't touch him, but on one condition. It's fine, Macha. -I am dead, Roy. Madi beat me up just now. Relax, Macha. Let's go find Muhammad first. We are doing that! I helped bring the bike. Two ringgit, please. Why don't you just fix the bike? You should repair it. I want to see. He's your responsibility. What if someone comes to get him? Starting well with the first turn. Fifteen turns all together for the racers... ...on the Sepang International Circuit. Our attention is on number 77. Ismadi Ibrahim. Muhammad, do you see the red motorcycle? Muhammad! Ismadi is in fifth place,... ...just behind Halim Zahid. It is as if Ismadi is hesitating. He is able to pass him... ...but it seems he doesn't want to pass Halim Zahid right now. Muhammad! Macha, come on. Macha. Muhammad! The placement hasn't changed. Ismadi is in fifth place,... ...behind Halim Zahid. Elly is in sixth place. While Obert is in seventh place. We can see the ranking now. What is going on with Ismadi Ibrahim right now? Hurry up, Macha. Roy. Macha, are you okay? -No. Roy. It's Muhammad. Muhammad! Go, Roy, Go! Ismadi is still pursuing... ...as if teasing Halim Zahid, with no plan to pass him. He remains in fifth place, with Halim turning back to see... ...where Ismadi is right now. What's this? This is my friend's son. What's up with you? -Nothing. Take that. We can see Ismadi Ibrahim... ...is still in fifth place... ...in the group in front. Elly is sixth and Obert seventh. The placement hasn't changed. Meanwhile, over here in the lead... ...is Piewat, still leading the race. Sivanesan is in second place... ...and Spark in third. "Muhammad Okay". "Muhammad Okay". That's what the board says. We don't know what that means... ...but it has given Ismadi a new motivation. A racer is way up front... ...that is Piewat, and that means Sivanesan is leading now. Spark in second place,... and Halim Zahid in third. Next to him... ...is someone who is trying to catch up. Ismadi Ibrahim is catching up to third. Successfully passing Halim Zahid. He is now in third. It seems that Sivanesan is leading... ...but it's second and third place between Spark and Ismadi. Spark is now next to Ismadi. We can see... ...it was close. We are in the final round. The last lap for all racers. Who will take second place? Sivanesan remains the first. The current placement shows an advantage for Spark... ...who is in second place. Spark and Ismadi head to head... ...but it seems that Ismadi is much faster. The podium for AP250. Asian Motorcycle Championship at the Sepang Circuit. The third place has sent a representative... ...and that is for Izwan Ismail. The second place... ...Ismadi Ibrahim, originally in fifth place... ...but successfully chased to second place. Congratulations to Ismadi. And the winner of the race... ...goes to F. Sivanesan. You're not done with Madi yet. COMING SOON
