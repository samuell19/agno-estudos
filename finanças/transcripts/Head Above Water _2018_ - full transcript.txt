- Okay, let's get into it. 131873 is my number. This is Ben Fordem on 2GB. Let's switch our focus right now to the S-Bay Surfing Championships in New South Wales. This is going to be huge. We've got two of the world's biggest surfers going head to head for the championship. Benji Halt, the Sydney boy. Crazy about surfing since the very beginning. Found by a talent scout and taken all the way to the top. - How you feeling? - Yeah, I'm feeling alright. I've been working pretty hard so... I was at it yesterday, there was a 15 foot swell and that was good because there was north-southerly coming in and I like to stand up on my board with my stance, so-- - [Reporter] You got any advice for anyone coming up the ranks in surfing? - There's no substitute for hard work, you know. You just gotta get out there in the surf, put in the hours, day in, day out, you know. I remember back when I was a little grommy and I used to skip school to surf, you know. This is my passion, I love it so much. - [Reporter] Ricky's won it the last five years, how do you feel going into this year's competition against him? - I'm gonna try my best and that's all I can do. - Voted honorary Indian of the Year in 2015, he's a multi-award winner, Benji Halt. He promises to put up a hell of a fight today. Up against him, his rival, Ricky Scrotun. Ricky's been surfing since the age of 8 and as the story goes, Ricky was so poor growing up, he surfed in his very first contest on a piece of corrugated iron. He won that day and became an instant celebrity. (girls shrieking) Ricky Scrotun, founder of the leading underwear giant, Scrotun's For Your Scrotum. - Passion. Competition. Australia. Scrotun's for Your Scrotum will make you glide faster in the water and last longer in the bedroom. I wear Scrotun's because it's good for my scrotums. Use the coupon code PEN15 and you can get them like hecks cheap and stuff Good luck next week, Halt. You're gonna need it. - [Reporter] You've been competing with Benji Halt for the last five years and beaten him, how do you feel going into a sixth year against him? - I'm feeling pretty confident, you know. Body's feeling good, legs are pretty polished. - Away from the surfing career and business empire, Ricky has recently become an ambassador to save our marine life, which protects our oceans. Two men, one prize. Who's it going to be today? Ricky, who's won 17 championships; Benji, who's claimed 11. Will it be the underdog story that Benji's hoping for or will Ricky once again slice the competition, just like his foot was sliced that day on the piece of corrugated iron? It's gonna be a big one, don't miss it. (waves crashing) - The S-bay International is the world's most renowned surfing competition. I mean, just even sitting there in the audience is just such an honour, you know. And then, as a surfer, it's like something you've never experienced. It's the ying yang. Getting into S-Bay is why a lot of people start surfing in the first place. - S-Bay 2015 was bigger and better than any year we've had. The crowds there were amped and the athletes were on top of their game. I'm a surfer just come out of six months in rehab, so the scheduling worked out well. I got my commentating job back, no complaints from my end. (crowds cheering) - Benji, Benji, how you feeling today? You feel nervous? - Yeah, look mate, I'm a little bit nervous but I've been practising hard so I'm mentally and physically ready for this, yeah. - Any special strategies for this, mate? - Benji was extremely nervous. I mean, he usually gets anxious before going into a competition but there's something about Ricky that really freaked him out. - Ricky Scrotun. Ricky fucking Scrotun. Yeah, that's your name mate. - The feet, yeah. The whole feet thing just really throws Benji off his game. - Well, this could be a scientific breakthrough for the human body. Ricky Scrotun has not been able to walk for three months, ever since he cut his feet on a piece of corrugated iron while surfing in a local swimming competition. The cuts were so severe that doctor's had no choice but to amputate Ricky's feet, leaving him stumpier than the 28 year old oak tree in my front yard. Though today, with the magic of science, he had bionic feet surgically attached, allowing him to walk again. - [Reporter] So, how does the new feet feel? - Very comfortable and great. - [Reporter] And now that you can walk again, what did you wanna do? - Well, I miss surfing and I wanna continue surfing again. - Yeah, you got this. Oh yeah, five time champion. Five time champion, mates. Who needs legs mate? Who needs 'em? Not you. Not you! - That was Billabong. They're gonna sponsor you if you win. - Oh finally, we've been chasing those guys for ages. - That'll be a nice little paycheck. - Yeah, I reckon. So, did they say what time the press junket was? I forgot to ask her. - They've moved it after the comp, I'm still waiting for Terry to give us the passes to get in. - I thought he posted them out last week? - Yeah, he was supposed to but maybe... Benji, we better get you ready quick. Come on. - [Ricky] Halt! - Don't let him get into your head. - You ready to get wet? - What? - Get wet. Out in water. In the ocean. - Uh, yeah. I'm ready to get wet with you, Ricky. - Wax up, mate. - Fuckin' weirdo. - That's fine. - We all knew Benji was inferior to Ricky but of all the places to be on edge, he had to choose S-Bay. He was doomed from the start. (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) (crowd cheering) - This live broadcast is brought you by Scrotun's For Your Scrotum. I'm Mac O'Brien and I'll be solo commentating today because my co-host hit the Jaegers far too hard and is now sleeping in. - Benji. Let's go pro. - Alright, let's do this. We getting paid for this? - No, we will be. - Good placement, mate. - I got this. - Well, the Scrotun togs Ricky was wearing were, um, very... big. - [Reporter] No, I mean, what did you think about the race? - Oh, um, Ricky was looking good. - And that goes there. Alright, beautiful. Wish me luck, mate. Thank you. (crowds cheering) - The final seconds before a competition is most vital for an athlete. It's when you got the most nerves but it's how you channel those nerves into the surf. - Benji Halt and Ricky Scrotun in their starting positions. The sun is out and the crowds are growing. Ricky there, wearing his Scrotun's For Your Scrotum, available now Australia wide. Just $19.95, when you use the coupon code P-E-N-1-5. - Hope you're ready, Halt. I'm about to fuck you. I mean, like on the waves. I'm gonna fuck you up. - I think you're under on the fucking today, brother. - Ah, you couldn't fuck me if you wanted to. - Well, I want to. - Yeah, well, don't waste your breath, bitch, 'cause you're gonna need it. - Alright. - We can see Benji and Ricky wishing each other a good luck there. - Hey Halt, do you kiss your mother with those lips? - I kiss the heaps of women I get, mate. (laughs) - No, you don't get any women, mate. - More than you, fuckhead. - No. I get heaps of women. You're looking at the five time nominee for Maximus' World's Hottest Man. Girls love me, man. - Yeah, but like, you've also got those weird, sort of cyborg feet and you've got a tiny nut sack, so like, I think that kind of makes you a bit nowhere as a bloke so you're a little bit irrelevant here. (crowds cheering) - [Mac] It's lovely to see them getting along before the big competition. - Yeah well, I fucked your mom with my cyborg dick and then I made her lick my nut sack and then, and then I said, "Yeah, I'm Ricky Scrotun" and I shoved my scrotum in her face. (crowds cheering) And then she ate my asshole and then I put my cyborg leg onto her face and I said, "Yeah, I'm the world's surfing champion." Good luck, Halt. You're gonna need it. - Here we go, the S-Bay Internationals 2015. And it's under way. Both surfers are paddling out to meet their destiny. And it's Benji in the lead, oh wait! Here he comes, Ricky! Ricky Scrotun! - Ricky's bionic feet were like flippers. They helped him paddle faster. - Was it cheating? Yeah. It was. But no one was gonna say anything. I mean, he just had his feet amputated. Cut the guy some slack. Just uh, don't cut off any more of his limbs. - Here goes Ricky, his first wave for today. There goes Ricky! Ricky Scrotun! He's killing it out there! (crowds cheering) Here comes Benji Halt. Now interesting to see how he fends today. Halt! Oh! Benji Halt, here he comes! 180! How do you like those scrotums, Ricky? How do you like that scrotum in your mouth, huh? You like that? Then, another word from our sponsor, Scrotun's for your Scrotum. (suspense-building music) Oh, oh, oh Benji, oh yes you did! (applause) Ricky with the reverse cowabunga! Benji seems to be a little preoccupied right now with Ricky dominating him on the leader board. (crowd cheers) - With the competition nearly over, Benji really needs to get some points on the scoreboard here. (crowd screams) - Everyone just froze. The officials, the crowd, the other competitors, everyone. - Is that a shark? It's a shark! (crowd screams) - It was quite a nightmare. Just seeing him helpless out there, it was, it was just out of this world. - Surfers always expect they might see a shark but never expect anything would happen. I remember thinking that could have been any of us. Yeah, it gives me chills. (jet ski engine) (helicopter blades) (dramatic music) - We are still waiting for confirmation, ladies and gentlemen, but it seems apparent that Benji has been attacked by a shark. Holding out now, the crowd is tense, there are nerves all over the grounds. Lifeguards do seem to have him, he seems okay. They're gonna be bringing him in. We'll have to wait for confirmation. - Benji, Benji, can you tell us what happened out there? - Man, I dunno. I just sort of saw this shadow behind me, I think it was a shark, I dunno, I just saw it out there, I dunno. I dunno, man, I was just... - How did you possibly survive? - I dunno, man, I just saw this shadow behind me and then I punched it, and then I just crawled on the board and I just... Fuck. - Benji, you're a hero. - Watching what happened on TV, I'd just started lunch. It was so awful. I kept pinching myself, saying, "It's only a nightmare." (dramatic music) - Okay, give me some room, give me some room. (dramatic music) (crowd cheers) - This just seems too crazy to be true. Surfer Benji Halt has been attacked by a shark while competing at the S-bay Internationals. There is horrific footage coming through to our news room. It shows that he survived the attack but he's very lucky. Witnesses say he punched the shark before being rescued by life guards. - Breaking news from the S-bay Internationals now. - Surfer Benji Halt has been attacked by a shark. (foreign language) - Benji was attacked while surfing against rival, Ricky Scrotun. (foreign language) - As horrific as this footage is, he survived the attack by punching the shark. - By punching the shark. (foreign language) (crowds cheering) - [Mac] How brave do you think he is, Josh? - [Josh] He's gotta be one of the bravest guys, I can't believe he did that. He's a man of steel. - [Ben] Harriet, you're up next. Go right ahead. - [Harriet] Ben, I just wanna say how much of a great sport that Benji is, I watched that video and I just couldn't believe it, he is so brave. What an amazing man! (upbeat electronic music) Benji is just a hero, he should be our next Australian of the Year. (girls screaming) - I just can't believe it, he's like my idol. I just can't believe it. He's so much more beautiful in real life, oh my God! - So my followers, what's up? Obviously I'm a hero now, just riding the wave to success. - Hi you all, it's Frenchie here. So I just heard about old Benji Halt punching a shark. - Just wanna give a big shout-out to my boy, Benji Halt. - Benji Halt, you are the man, son. - You're a dead set hero, mate. Love your work. (thrilling music) - Zac, have you ever seen anything like this before? - [Zac] Hi, I haven't, mate. Words can't describe the way I'm feeling at the moment. This guy's like an Australian hero to me, I mean, the danger here in being to act the way he did, I mean, I just don't know what to say. I'm speechless. - Good day guys, Benji Halt here, national hero. Self-defense is incredibly important, it's even more important out of the water, that's why it's incredibly important that you go out and purchase my Miren Defence DVD Boxset for the small price of $398. Come on, guys, Benji Halt here, now I know I've told you guys I'd only ever get a tattoo if I found something that had a lot of meaning to me so I know you guys are gonna love this one. Alright, let's go. (upbeat music) - I love him so much, words can't describe how much I love him. (Woman screaming) - Yeah, it gets a bit like that, you don't realise how good you look until you see your head on a magazine, I guess. (girls screaming) (laughs) - Oh, shut up (laughs). Whoo! Yeah! I'm Benji Halt and I'm a national hero. I never thought I'd be so rich and famous, just like that shark, I never saw it coming. But now that I am a hero, I wanna exploit you. Which is why I reckon you should buy this, Sharkade. Buy yours today and get the fuck amongst it. - Well, ladies and gents, I'm so excited to introduce the shark puncher himself, Mr. Benji Halt. (applause) Hello! - Hello. - So how are you? How you going? I must say, I'm very excited to have you on the show. I've been looking forward to this one. - Yeah, yeah, cheers. What are you called, again? - I'm Kate. - Oh yeah. (laughing) Yeah. - Been hanging out with too many ladies, have we? - Yeah, so many. - So, yes. - It starts to all really blend together, really, its ridiculous. Is that a couple out there? (cheers) - Yes, the ladies are very excited. - Yeah, no, I've hooked up with her before, yeah. - Oh, okay. (awkward laugh) So tell us, so international celebrity, shark puncher, I've had loads of questions coming in but really, what's on all of the ladies' lips is are you single? - I am. (laughing) - Really? Well, I have to say, I was out shopping the other day and I saw this cover. "Sexiest man of the year" being voted. As you can see, the ladies are really excited. So tell us about Ricky Scrotun then. So, what are your thoughts on him? - Bit of a strange question, I would have thought this would be about me but um-- - Well, we like to mix it up a bit, it can't all be about you. - Yeah, so they say. Right so, yeah, no, Ricky, he's um... Look, I've spent a lot of time with him, went up in the junior ranks with him so you know, been with him since day one. But you know, one thing that I find strange about Ricky, and I feel like I'm going crazy, I might be the only one that notices this but he's got those bionic feet, of course, and everyone knows this but he classes himself as disabled. Like he's got the disabled park on a car but he actually skied a wave last year in Maui and he's the first guy I've ever seen win a surf championship without a surfboard, and I thought was pretty strange. - So you question his integrity, really. Like his morals, fact. - No, not his morals. More the fact that he's like, half cyborg. - Okay so what can you do? I guess you've gotta outperform him. (laughs) - Yeah, well, I certainly do that in the bedroom. (laughs) - We can imagine. - Yeah, yeah. No, it's true. It's true. Anyway, that reminds me, I better get out of here. - Oh, are you off? Oh well, we still had five minutes. - Ah well (laughs) That's your loss, not mine. (laughs) - Okay, well great to see you. - Benji Halt was the hottest thing around Australia. He was a superstar. He was the shark puncher. - The international support that Benji received was amazing. I just, I can't describe it any other way. - Thank you all for coming out today to celebrate something that can only be described as an act of pure courage. This year, by no surprise to any of us, the St. Michael's Award for Bravery goes to a Mr. Benji Halt. And before I forget, don't forget to vote in your July election for your Councilwoman Andrews, yes, yes. Anyway, have a lovely day. - Yeah, no one cares, love. Thanks so much for coming out and seeing me in person. It must be overwhelming for most of you but it will subside. Now, this award means so much to me but what means most is the fact that you all got to come out and see me in the flesh. And this is something that I will probably forget but you certainly won't forget this moment. So... Yeah, catch you later. Have a good one. Thanks mate. Cheers. - Cheers. Here's to you. - Did you ever think when you first signed me as a client that I'd be receiving a bravery award? - Well, it never came up in the contract, so no, not at all. I'm still surprised you graduated high school. - I reckon it's gonna look pretty nice on my mantelpiece, next to my honorary Indian of the Year token. - Yeah, I was never sure how you won that award? - Benji, how's it going? Collin Mednes. - Oh, hi man. How are you? - Pete. - Good going. Congratulations on the award. Well deserved, mate. I'm a film producer with Global Pictures. As you know, your incredible story has reached an international audience and with your agreement, we'd like to meet up with you to develop a movie about you. - Wow. - You serious? - Yeah, they're thinking a drama-thriller, based on the struggle of making your living as a professional surfer and beating the odds of fighting off a shark. Call it Fighting For Breath, based on the true story of Benji Halt. We'll get Chris Nolan to direct it, make it all dark and gritty, like his Batman films. - Well, I love those movies. - Yeah well, maybe we should uh, we'll orgainse a meeting next week, talk through details. Benji's schedule's really hectic right now. - Yeah, most definitely. Here are my contact details, call me tomorrow and we'll organise something. - Alright. - Hey mate, before you go, who's gonna star as me in the movie? Do you know that yet or... - Well, don't tell anyone, it's still under wraps. He had to turn down Interstellar 2 for this film. Academy Award winning actor, Matthew Mcconaughey. - Oh. - He'll be in touch. - He'll be in touch. - Just seems so unlikely. - Well, I think it's gonna be pretty good. Well, I don't think it's gonna be good, I don't really think it's gonna be great, but I think getting someone like Matthew Mcconaughey to play me in a movie is gonna be alright, alright, alright. - How many of those has he had? Just, that's enough. - Benji Halt was overflowing with success. I mean, one week he's a professional surfer, the next, he's signing bloody movie deals. I mean, he was on top of the world. - I'd just like to extend my support to Benji Halt. We are rivals out on the waves but what he did, his bravery, he's earned my respect. - Are you annoyed the competition was called a tie, even though you were ahead on the scoreboard? - No. I fully endorse marine wildlife but Benji was attacked by a shark. A fucking shark. Do I need to spell it out for you? - If you want, sure. - Well, I can't actually spell. Joke's on you. (snickers) - What would you have done if you'd been attacked? - You know what, nothing's gonna attack me with these. (knock on steel) Pretty indestructible. Super dense metallic aluminium alloyed steel casing, no match for a shark. No match for a plane. No match for an atomic bomb. Yeah, they tested it. Still standing. - Hey guys, how you going? - [Children] Hi. Little bit more enthusiasm, come on! Yes, that's right. Okay, let's start things off. So, your stance needs to be a balance between your front weight and your back weight, okay. So angle your legs roughly out at 45 degrees, okay. Just yeah, stay low at 45 degrees there, yeah. - How do you punch a shark? - (laughs) Yeah, a good question, mate. You just gotta punch it with your forearm, okay, that's where the strength comes from. So let's all practise that, guys. Bang, bang, bang, bang. - Benji, - Bang. - Benji. Ah, take a break guys, Benji will be with you in one second. - Keep doing that guys, that's great, keep it up, good stuff. What's up? I just had a call from one of the S-Bay officials. - What happened? - Well, he wants us to come in and have a chat with him. - I thought they wanted to leave the competition as a tie, something about being attacked by a shark. - Yeah, I dunno what they want. - Great work, guys. Keep it up. That's really good, I love it. - For someone who'd been treated like a hero for so long, Benji had no idea what was coming. - I just remember getting off the phone with the officials, they seemed really concerned. I just wanted to get Benji and get over there to meet them as soon as possible. - Ah, Mr. Halt, Pete. How are you? - Yeah man, I think I'll be a bit better when I know what this is about. - Of course but first, as you can see, we've done a full reconstruction here. We've got rid of a wall, made room for some more desks and then we got wireless internet throughout the entire office. Wireless internet, it is the future. - So, what's this about. - Well, it's quite simple really. Basically, no more cables. Wireless internet magically going throughout the whole office, you know, no more 56k. 100, 200... Right, sorry, you're not talking about the wireless internet, you're talking about the compeition. - Yes. - Right. Of course, this way. - Is this fuckhead serious? - Hey, hey, be nice. - Well, yesterday we had the animal rights union come in to take a closer look at the attack. - Well, they better not be suing us. That punch was clearly self-defense. (laugh) - Well, you're gonna have to take that up with them. Anyway, we had a look at some of the footage that was on the camera that Benji was wearing and it looks like it wasn't a shark that attacked you. - What? - What? - It was a dolphin. Tina, would you please? Take a look for yourself. We had some marine biologists confirm the footage and they determined that there was a school of tuna fish swimming beneath you and the dolphin was chasing it. It must have bumped into you, you think it was a shark and you punched it. Right there, there it was. - But dolphins don't eat tuna, they eat mackerel. - Yeah, I haven't studied dolphins but-- - But the marine biologist has? - Yeah, yip. But I did say chasing, so they weren't actually eating. - Just fun. - Just for fun. They were just having a laugh. They just, I don't know what they do in the water but it would be pretty boring. - So is the dolphin alright? - Um... No. It's not good. - Oh sweet baby Jesus. - I don't know how to break it to you. Its not looking good. You punched it right in the face and there's more to it but I'm not gonna go into anymore details for a sensitive topic in front of Tina. - Sorry about this. Sorry about this mate, you didn't know. It's not your fault. I mean, you punched a dolphin but it's not your fault that you punched a dolphin. - In the nose. Good shot, though. - Okay, we'll manage this. This is okay. - [Official] It's fine. - This is not okay. - Well, it's not okay because, yeah, it's because the animal rights union is suing you for punching a dolphin. - Oh great. - Ah man. Are you serious now? - Yeah, I'm serious. I'm not joking about that. That is absolutely true. - That's alright, we'll manage this. It's okay. The chicks will still love you, Halt. - Well, might just move him out the way. Don't want Flandis to get hit. - You called the dolphin Flandis? - Yeah, Flandis from Sim6. Don't you think it resembles to a degree? - I really wanna punch you in the fucking head. - Try. - That's not gonna look good. Dolphins, humans. Just go easy on the punching from now on. He's not usually like this, it's just, yeah... - I'm screwed. I'm screwed. - You're not. - [Official] You guys will sort this out. - I'm screwed. I'm screwed. - [Official] You'll sort it out. Tea, anyone? - Yeah, um-- - [Official] Green? Jasmine? - Have you got any Chai? That will calm you a little bit, yeah, we'll try, yeah? - I don't wanna try. I don't wanna try. - You don't wanna try? - I don't wanna try it. - [Official] Okay, coffee then? - I don't want your shit, I don't want it. I don't want anything. - Oh, well, dinner? I dunno. - Once we were out, we were fucked. - Well, you remember the story of the shark attack from the other day? We've got an update for you right now. It turns out it wasn't a shark that Benji Halt punched, but a bottle-nosed dolphin. - And in other news today, it has been announced that at this year's popular S-bay surfing competition, Benji Halt-- - Benji Halt-- (foreign language) - Actually punched a dolphin. - Punched a dolphin. (foreign language) - [Crowd] Stop Benji Halt! Stop Benji Halt! Stop Benji Halt! Stop Benji Halt! - Harriet, take it away. - [Harriet] Ben, I just had to call in to say how disappointed I am. I just can't believe it. He should be ashamed of himself and, you know, I think he needs to come out and make a public apology, you know. I just, I can't believe it. - Well, who doesn't like dolphins, seriously? - The proposed film, Fighting For Breath, based on the true story of Benji Halt, has officially been cancelled. - I support animal welfare. It's wrong what he's doing, it's really terrible, I hate it. - [Ben] You've seen the footage, we now know it was a dolphin. - [Person On The Phone] I can't believe Benji would do this, I'm shocked. I just feel like he's tricked all of Australia. - This is an outrage, it's an injustice. We will be suing Benji Halt for what he has done, he will be going away for it. - [Reporter] Benji! Benji! - Ah, fuck off, mate. - Benji Halt, how the fuck could you punch a dolphin? They are noble fucking creatures. - Benji, just fuck off, mate. No one likes you. - Do you know how many times I've pretended to be a dolphin trainer to impress girls? Didn't work but, good on me for having a crack. - Benji is disgusting. How do you think you can punch a dolphin and get away with it? You can't. - [Person On The Phone] Good afternoon. I feel, I feel pretty devastated, mate. I've been a long-time dolphin lover, I went to Sea World when I was a kid and these are my favourite animal and to see my sporting hero turn out to punch one of them. I just, I dunno what to say. I feel like a knife through the heart, mate. - [Reporter] Benji, Benji, can you make a comment? - No, man, no, I don't wanna talk right now. - [Reporter] Anything about the accusations, Benji? - No mate, I'm just going, I'm just trying to go for a walk, mate. Just leave me alone. - Oh, hello dolphin! - (clicks) Please don't punch me like Benji did! - Oh don't worry, I won't punch you. Don't punch anyone. Especially not dolphins. (dolphin clicks) - I just wanna apologise to all my followers, I didn't realise it was a dolphin. You know, I'm sorry. - This studio cannot associate with animal cruelty. We also apologise to Matthew Macconaughey for turning down Interstellar 2 for this film. - It really blew up in Benji's face but the worst part was when Ricky found out. - You have to remember, Ricky was the founder of the marine animal rights community. He felt very strongly about animal welfare. - [Reporter] So, Ricky, you heard the news? - The news? Oh, the news about Benji Halt punching a dolphin. That news? Yes, I heard the fucking news. Look if Benji Halt wants to go around punching dolphins, that's his choice but don't expect me, a lover of all marine wildlife, to stand by and fucking let him off. Halt, you wanna punch something, mate? Punch me and see what happens. - Ricky lost it. He really lost it. Can you blame him? - I made sure Benji stayed well clear of Ricky. (crowds shouting) - So Benji's on the board, the fin's coming, the dolphin, and he's there. He must have put his back into it and this huge uppercut down. No, that feels weird. Maybe it was more like, he's in the position, lower back... - Yeah, I know things are really crazy right now but they'll settle down, I promise. - [Vince] Ready, here he comes! - Well, I've got it under control so... Don't make any decisions just now-- - [Vince] Anyway, it's coming, he's getting ready, he's seeing it. - It was Billabong. You'll be fine. - [Vince] And we return now to breaking news. You may have thought that a poor innocent dolphin being punched is bad enough, well we've just received confirmation, the dolphin is now in a coma and has washed upon shore. - Oh my God. - [Vince] Lisa has more. - Yes Vince. Well, it appears Benji Halt punches extremely hard. The bottle-nosed dolphin fell into a concussion following the punch during the very popular surfing competition yesterday and this morning, washed onto shore. Biologists from Sea World were onto the scene quickly and they took the animal back here to Quarantine Bay where, as you can see behind me, biologists and indeed the world are hoping the animal wakes from the coma sooner rather than later. This has been Lisa Thompson for Channel 6 News, back to you, Vince. - [Vince] Thank you, Lisa. And remember, tweet your condolences with the hashtag #welovedolphins - You know that saying, the shit hits the fan? Well, for Benji, the shit kept hitting the fan. First the world hated him for punching a dolphin, then they hated him even more when they found out the dolphin was in a coma. - I went down to the fruit market yesterday. They refused to serve me because I'm related to Benji. If disowning my son means that they'll serve me at the shops again, then I guess I have a lot of paperwork to fill out this afternoon. - What do I do then? I can't even take a piss without someone blowing up about it. - Just calm down, right. We've just gotta think carefully about our next move. I'll organise a driver and we'll go to my office and we'll just sort this shit out, okay? (cell phone rings) - Hello? - [Ricky] Halt. - Ricky? It's Ricky. - Hang up! - I've got this. - [Ricky] How dare you? You put that dolphin into a coma. I'm coming for you, Halt. You are dead. - He's coming for me. - Everyone was worried what Ricky might do to Benji. It was trying times. - It was all just getting too much. Benji was a ticking time bomb. I mean, I don't blame him but yeah, took everything I had to keep it together. It was difficult. - Just to Ninth Avenue thanks. - Benji Halt? Is that Benji in the back? - Yeah, it's me. Nice to know I've still got a few fans-- - Get the fuck out of the taxi, you dolphin puncher. Get out. Get out! - [Crowd] Dolphin puncher! Dolphin puncher! - Benji! - [Crowd] Dolphin puncher! Dolphin puncher! - Benji, wait! - [Crowd] Dolphin puncher! - He finally cracked. The time bomb went off. - I knew if Benji was left by himself, he might do something, you know, crazy but I had a good idea of where he was going. - Hey there. I just thought I should check up on you. I'm sorry for the punch, I didn't mean to hit you that hard, I did a bit of Tae Kwon Do in high school but I never thought you'd be on the back end of one of my left hooks, to be honest. I want you to know, I am really sorry about this, mate. I am. I just, I just can't deal with everyone hating on me at the moment, you know? It's too much. My own mother's trying to disown me. She actually emailed me a form I had to sign, can you believe it? I'll show you. If you ever wake up, I'll show you the form. I need you to pull through, little fellow. We all need you to pull through. Don't you go into the light, you've got too much to offer this world. See they're just calling you Dolphin in here. We've gotta give you a new name, that's no respect. You've got some pretty strange looking chompers there, mate. I'm gonna call you Colgate. So sorry for putting you in a coma, Colgate. (sobs) (mumbles) Such a beautiful soul. Very salty face, sorry. Shit, your face is salty. You always this salty, mate, or what? - [Ricky] Get away from the dolphin. - Ah shit. Security. - Get the fuck away from it. - Ricky, no, I'm making amends. - Get away from the dolphin! - Why don't you show some respect, mate? (yelling) - How dare you, Halt? How dare you touch one of God's most majestic creatures? - I didn't mean it, you know I didn't mean to do it. You know this. - Punch me. Punch me! Punch me. - What? - Like you punched this beautiful, innocent dolphin. Go on! - I'm not gonna punch you. - Punch me! - I'm not gonna punch you, I'm not gonna punch you. I'm not gonna punch you, I'm making amends. I'm making amends. - I will avenge you. (scream of pain) - Oh! Goddammit. - That's what you get, Halt. That's what you get. Never touch a dolphin again. - Every athlete fights their rivals from time to time, but if Ricky Scrotun was my rival, you wouldn't catch me fighting him. Have you seen the size of his feet? - Oh God, not the feet. - I'm doing it fucking today. Mammal on mammal, just how you like it. (grunting) (mumbling) - Let him go, Ricky. - Shit! Hey, don't shoot me, shoot him. - Stand up. - Oh no, not the feet. - Put your foot down. Now! Put your foot down now. - Never. - I said put your foot down now. - He deserves this. - Don't make me shoot. - Never. - Put your foot down now, Ricky. I'll shoot. Put it down now. - Shoot me. - Well, if you thought this story couldn't get any stranger, it just has. Today, Ricky Scrotun shot dead by police, whilst trying to kill rival surfer, Benji Halt. - You can say what you like about Ricky Scrotun but he was passionate about marine wildlife. Deadly passionate. No pun intended. I'm sorry, that was inappropriate. - The death of any person is a tragedy, but the death of a world class surfer, that is next level. - Ricky Scrotun is a hero. He died defending animal rights, he died supporting his beliefs, he will never be forgotten. - Not many people live life like Ricky Scrotun. On one side, he was a world class surfer. A millionaire who live the high life but there was another side to Ricky. He was the founder of the animal rights community and he fought passionately to maintain the pristine life. Unfor... Un... Excuse me? This is funeral service. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, mate, I'm gonna take him out for one last wave, alright. No, no, no, but don't let me stop you, you're doing a great job, mate. Just keep talking, do it, yeah. - Unfortunately... Unfortunately, this belief got the better of him when police shot him dead, fighting for his belief. Today, we lay Ricky to rest in the one place he truly loved. - It was all Benji's idea. I think it was his way of apologising to everyone for everything that had happened. He needed closure and to pay his respect to Ricky. - I must admit, I did find it quite touching. You know, its a lovely way for two rivals to release a build up of tension and move on. Well, not for Ricky, obviously. (slow, sad music) - We leave Ricky in the ocean. Whether it was protecting the animals or surfing, Ricky loved the ocean. (dramatic music) - I'm sorry. - Just like that, Benji Halt was taken out of this world by the same animal he thought he punched the first time around. - I mean, what can I say? - Well, I only just finished sending off the disownment forms. - Once again, truth is stranger than fiction. Today, Benji Halt was attacked and killed by a shark while he was paying respects to his rival, Ricky Scrotun. Earlier in the week, Benji punched a dolphin thinking it was a shark but this time, there is absolutely no mistake. He died instantly. - I mean, I guess you could say it was fitting how it all wraps up. Don't get me wrong, I miss Benji every day but I think it's how he would have wanted to go. In the powerful jaws of a 15 foot Great White shark. (waves crashing) - As for the dolphin, he eventually woke up from his coma and was released back into the ocean. - God has given us a miracle today. This beautiful dolphin has woken up. We're in the final stages of getting him home and we've tagged him so we can keep track of him for the next few weeks. (crowds cheering) - After about a week, the animal rights union checked up on the dolphin and had a look at the tracking data. - Turns out, three days after being released back into the wild, Colgate the dolphin was harpooned by a Japanese whaling vessel. - Unluckiest fucking dolphin on earth. - And just like that, it's over. The craziest rivalry in surfing history. - Out of respect, the surfing union erected a statue at S-Bay to commemorate the events of Ricky Scrotun, Benji Halt and bottle-nosed dolphin. - The statue was very... generous. - Benji really did respect Ricky and vice versa. They were rivals and they pushed each other to the top of national surfing. You're only as good as your own rival and I think the mutual respect was definitely there. - Yeah man, I'm feeling pretty good. I've been working real hard, obviously, and I'm hoping that at some point I can quit my day job because you know, surfing is my life, it is my passion and I've met a lot of cool dudes, there's a lot of talented guys coming through as well, like in particular, I've become quite good friends with a guy called Ricky Scrotun. He's a guy I really admire, you know, like, he's got a bit of adversity in his life, he's got these knarly bionic feet, but that doesn't stop him charging out in the waves and I've got so much respect and admiration for the dude. - Look, I'm on the up, I think, but he's the man to beat and I have a lot of respect for him and one day, I hope to be able to be as good as him. - He's been spending a lot of time with my mum, which is quite strange 'cause my mum doesn't really approve of many of my mates but, yeah, she digs Ricky. Like, it's cool. - I might have fucked his mum but look, it was out of respect. She needed something. But Benji, he's a great man and he deserves all the respect he can get. - Lot of shit went down at S-Bay 2015. There's a lot of negative memories of Benji. I just try to remember the positive things that he did with his life. And I know that if he were still with us, you know, he'd wanna keep surfing, he'd wanna keep battling it out with Ricky, he just wanted to have a good time. That's all he ever really wanted.
