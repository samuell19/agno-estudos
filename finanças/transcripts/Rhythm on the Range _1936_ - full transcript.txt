["Ooga" Horns, Police Whistle Blowing] Good afternoon, Miss Ryland. Am I late? Only slightly, Miss Ryland. Yours, Miss Ryland? Gosh, no, Ben. That's for my niece. I figured a body tinkering with matrimony... might want to look at a book of directions. ♪♪ [Organ Playing "I Love You Truly"] Let us pause to consider a moment this high occasion: two hands in solemn compact joined, two hearts pledged in sacred union. How beautiful to behold is the sight of two young people... as they stand on the threshold of holy matrimony. When a young woman takes the hand of the man of her choice, how rare is the joy, and how celestial. Need we rehearse any further, since the groom isn't here? Why, of course not. He doesn't need a rehearsal. At his last wedding, he prompted the minister. The groom oughta be here. Ah, Penny. You're right, cowgirl. You're right. The groom ought to be here. Doris, why don't you go ahead and marry the China boy? It'd teach 'em both a lesson. Who are you? Well, if you're not too literal, I'm the matron of honor. Oh, please don't mind Connie, Aunt Penny. Small talk's her specialty. I can see that. But, honey, the talk's too small for a great occasion. Miss Ryland, I quite agree with you. So do I. Come on, Doctor. Well, you win, old-timer. You've moved heaven and Wall Street against me. Forgive me, for the sake of my soul... and the good of my credit. Sure. Glad it's not too late to save your credit. You're one up, Penny. No, Charley, you're not really married. Oh, thank you very much. I sure thought I'd get a chance to meet the groom today. What's he like, honey? Oh, he's nice. Yeah, but what does he do? Well, he's on Wall Street. He's not exactly the wolf down there but a good, comfortable vice president. And he plays polo. Not championship, of course, but this year his club is using him to sub on first team. And he's, uh, he's-- Oh, well,John's just a man. - [ Penny] No foolin'. - [Doris] No foolin. That's the lucky man. John Ashville Dobie III. Third what? The third John Ashville Dobie. You mean to stand there and insinuate there were two others like this? Well, at least that. The family goes all the way back to 1550. 'Tain't far enough, if you ask me. What did you expect, Aunt Penny, a superman? Oh, no, but a young wife usually makes her husband sound like a superman. There's no use being naive about it. I'll be as happy as the next one. That's all, Elizabeth. Doris, darling, I'm off. Is there any doubt of it? [ Laughs] Well, the next time I see you, you'll be Mrs.John Ashville Dobie III. So I will. I could spoil it by dashing up to the altar and shrieking "I forbid the banns." Oh, not you. You'll have much more fun trying to pick him off afterwards. - I'm not promising I won't. - If you did promise, I wouldn't believe you. - [Connie] Well, as long as we understand each other. - I understand you perfectly. For a wedding gift, I'll give you the name of a good detective agency. What? Oh, we're shocking your aunt. Life is like that, Miss Ryland, in the social jungle. The flower girl precedes the bride, and the detective follows the groom. Good-bye. Bye. Good-bye, darling. Good-bye, sweet. ♪♪ [ Humming "The Wedding March"] Isn't she married? Not seriously. She and her husband don't get along very well. And she's got her eye on yours already. Oh, Connie's a bit of a snake, but she's all right. Doris, I-- Well, I don't know just how to say this, but-- Well-- At every wedding, there oughta be a woman. I think all the experts agree on that point, Aunt Penny. Oh, ho, I don't mean the bride. I mean an older woman. At a time like this, there oughta be someone to hand out advice-- somethin' your father can't buy for ya, even if he is one of the richest bankers in New York. That's right. What is it you advise? Well, of course, I ain't the best person in the world for this. I'm just an old weather-beaten Westerner. Not that I haven't had some experience handlin' men. In the mountains up our way, the boys make passes like any other male critter, and believe me, when a girl's fought her way through those mountain passes, she's done somethin'. Yes, Aunt Penny. Mmm, well, what I wanna say is-- Oh, doggone. It's all here in this book. Oh, thank you. Oh, you're sweet, Aunt Penny. Give me a hug. We'll say good-bye at the rodeo. Yes, we'll see you at the Garden. Honey, you said you'd be as happy as the next one. I wanted you to be a whole lot happier than that. I'd hate to come back next year and find you just another claim-jumpin' husband rustler, like that diamondback that just slithered out of here. [ Horns Honking] ♪♪ [Man] I know you can do it. All you gotta do is stand up there and try it. [Indistinct Chatter] [Man] Now go and put that half-a-dollar on your nose. Now stick out your arms. Put that water in his hands. Now stand steady, and don't move 'til I say go. One, two, three. Go. There you are. Pretty good, huh? Aw, that's a silly trick. Bet you four bits you can't do it. Bet you he can. Go on, Buck. Show him. I'll try it. All right, come on. I don't see nothin' to it. Of course there ain't nothin' to it. You can do it. Sure. There you are. Now hold up your head. Put the water in his hands. That's it. There you are. He can do it. Sure. Wait 'til I say go. One, two-- Hey, hey, hand over my funnel. You had the fun. I'll have the funnel. Howdy, Buck. Howdy, Miss Penny. Where’s Jeff? He's down at the corral. Well, come on. Let's find him. All right. [Cowboy Yelling] [Crowd Cheering] That darn fool Jeff. He knows he can't ride no steer. Let's hope the steer don't know it. [Crowd Laughing, Woman Screaming] He knows it. Jeff! Hey,Jeff! Jeff! Well, that makes it tougher. Jeff Larabee, are you trying to commit suicide? No, he just can't balance his bull budget. He's entered every contest tryin' to win enough money to buy that brute. Ain't he a beauty? He's one of the finest purebreds... that Colonel Johnson brought to this show. He's not worth breakin' your neck for. His name is Cuddles. - Boy, ain't he dignified. - I wonder how dignified he's gonna look... the first time he backs into a cactus. Well, you're his partner, ain't you? What are you doin' to help? Well, Penny, Buck's been in kind of tough in this show. We just figured out the firsts and the seconds and the other points, and near as we can tell, he's fightin' it out for last place. Well, remember, you're both still workin' for me. Yes, ma'am. You stick to your ropin' and your ridin'. I'll be out front rootin' for you. Good luck. Thanks. Come on, Buck. Get Cuddles a pail of water. "Get Cuddles a pail of water." Want some water for Cuddles. [Crowd Cheering, Whistling] Hello. Howdy. Say, there's one thing about the East. It sure is easy to get water. Well, that's true, brother, on the face of it. So long. Hello, Aunt Penny. Hello, honey. Hello. I can't stay very long. I just stopped in to say good-bye. I'm staying, though, and I'll see you to the station. That's nice. Only it ain't a station. It's a freight siding in Weehawken. And I'm traveling west in my boxcar, you know, just the way I came. [ Bellowing Sound] What have you got there? Oh, that's a little homemade slip horn I threw together. Sounds kinda sweet, don't it? Let me hear it again. [ Bellowing Sound] Well, it's a matter of opinion. All I hear is "bazooka." Bazooka? Yeah. Bazooka. Boy, I bet this slip horn is self-baptizing. What do you mean? I'm gonna call that thing a bazooka. Say, is our business bazookas or bulls? We gotta get some more dough or we're gonna lose Cuddles. [P.A. Announcer] The next event, folks, is the wild cow milkin' contest. Did you ever milk a wild cow? No. Well, you're gonna. [Spectators Laughing] Whoa, Bossy. Stop that rumba. Keep it simple. We want milk, not a milkshake. - Come on, Buck! - Huh? [Crowd Laughing] In the bottle! Give, sweetheart, give. Go on. Get goin'. Go ahead! Go on! - Yip-- - [Spectators Laughing] Two grown men chasing a scared cow. You must admit, it's rather silly. Milking a wild cow is a glittering piece of intelligence... compared to some of the humor I saw around your house. Meaning what? Bob, don't let her do it. Are you referring to Doris's marriage? Send her out West with me for awhile. Give her a chance to think it over. Really, Penelope, there's nothing for her to think over. Well, I think there is. Why in thunder is she marrying this stuffed shirt that she don't love? - You don't need his money, and she don't need him. - You manage your cows, Penelope, and we'll try to manage our destinies. Say, listen-- In the meantime, let's not be conspicuous. [Announcer] Introducin' Miss Penelope Ryland. [Applause] Stand up, Penny. ♪♪ [Fanfare] [Applause Continues] There she is, folks, Miss Penelope Ryland, owner of the famous Frying Pan Ranch from Green Pastures, Arizona. A square-shootin', forthright daughter of the West. A true pioneer woman! [Applause] I don't know what you're makin' all this fuss about. Bein' a pioneer woman was just bein' a normal woman, and I'd hate to think that normal women... was so rare here in the East... that ya have to go huntin' for 'em with searchlights... and yellin' for 'em through microphones. Those pioneer women-- women like my mother, your grandmother-- they weren't Western women. They were Eastern women! [Crowd Cheering] I'm glad to hear you applaud 'em. I applaud 'em, too, those Eastern women. They married the men they loved, and they stuck to 'em, [Applause] even when the darn galoots went trailin' out as far as the badlands in Arizona. That's all I gotta say, folks. No doubt you feel you've said plenty. Where's Doris? She'll probably be right back. [Crowd Cheering] Well, partner, if you win this event, we'll have just half the money we need. What good's half a bull? That's the stuff! Ah, stay with him! [Crowd Cheering] Look at that boy ride!

Yeah, but we're still a lot short. Doggone, boy, when you once get an idea in your head, you can't shake it out. Say, there's still that song contest. I might have a chance in that. How much does that pay? They haven't announced yet, but it oughta pay somethin'.

[Applause, Whistling] Now, ladies and gentlemen, for the next and last event on our program, the boys will demonstrate that playful little pastime... known as "wrastlin' the steer"... for a cash prize of $350. [Cheers, Whistles] Well, you win. [Crowd Shouting] Next rider's an added entry, Mr. Buck Eaton. Buck is gonna break his tie for last place... or break his neck. [Bellowing, Snorting] Hey, Buck, you ain't never wrastled a steer in your life. Well, the steer ain't never wrastled me either, so I reckon we're even. Turn him out, boys. [Applause, Cheering] Four seconds, folks! A new world's record! Ya-ha! Steer must've fainted. ♪♪ [Band] Well, we didn't make it. Sure, we did. We won enough money. We still owe a $28 hotel bill. We should've slept in the park--anything. If we hadn't pampered ourselves all week, we'd now be the proud possessors of Cuddles. You mean to tell me for that bull, I'm supposed to sleep in a pasture? Boy, I wouldn't pasteurize myself for nobody. Doggone it, boy, go ahead and buy your durned old bull. I'll pay the hotel bill. You will? Sure. Wait a minute. Where'd you get 28 bucks? Oh, I, uh-- I made some side bets with some of the boys. Why, you doggone old horned toad! You been holdin' out on me, huh? Uh-huh. Go over to the hotel and check out. I'll see you at the freight yard. So long, Santy Claus. Bye. Who? Doris? I don't know. I just got in. Wait. I'll see. If anybody had told me a month ago... that I'd be standin' out here tonight... talkin' to a bunch of people on the busy street of New York City, I'd have told 'em they was crazy. I understand that you people here in New York City... see pert near everything. And I imagine you'd be willing to pay a little somethin'... to see somethin' you never saw before. Well, tonight, you're gonna see two things you never saw in your life. First, you never saw a bazooka. And next, you never saw a man that needed $28 as bad as I need it. [ Laughing] Hey, hey, hey, where's your horse? That wasn't me that said that then, folks. That's somebody back over in here. I don't want you people to think... I'm a ventriloquist. Back in the mountains where I come from, I always wanted to better myself. I-I wanted the better things in life. I wanted to improve myself. I remember when I was 19 years old, I had a heart-to-heart talk with Papa. [Chuckling] I said, "Papa, I'm 19 years old now. "I'm gettin' to be a man, and I think it's about time... I was startin' to wear shoes." [ Laughing] [ Drunkenly] Hey, wh-where's your horse? You know, folks, when I was a little boy back home, I had to take care of a stubborn mule. And I used to get so mad at him. But one mornin' this mule was more stubborn than usual, and I just lost my temper, and I picked up an ax and knocked his brains out, and he died. Then-- You know, my old grandma always told me... that jackass would haunt me someday. [Horns Honking] Now, of course, I couldn't expect to come out here... and get $28 off of you people... without givin' you somethin' for it. Well, you're gonna get it right now. [Car Horns Honking] [Whistle Blowing, Bell Clanging] [Horn Honking] Got about six feet. Take it easy. Hold it. [Train Whistle Blowing, Bell Clanging] - That all, Jeff? - Yeah, you can take her away. Hey, Conductor! Hello there, cowboy. - Have you seen Penny Ryland or Buck? - No. - How long before you're pullin' out? - As soon as the engine hooks on. [ Lowing, Snorting] [ Bell Clanging, Coupling Crashes] [ Bucket Clanging] You can't leave 'til Penny and Buck get here. Brother, hot or cold, this train pulls out right now. Well, listen, you can't do this. They're gonna miss the train. So will you, son, if you don't climb aboard. [Train Chugging] Ah. [Whistle Blowing] Doggone, we missed it! Well, we ain't missed much. When you've seen one train, you've seen 'em all. ♪♪ [Whistling] Ouch! Hey, what are you doin' here? Oh! The train's moving. Why, yes, they do, sometimes. How did you get on? Are you the only one here? Well, I'm the only one that belongs here. How did you get on? Well, it's a long story. Somebody left the door open. The train jolted, and I must have bumped my head. And here I am. Well, you don't look like a hobo. Well, thank you. Are you? No. Then how do you happen to be bummin' a ride in this boxcar? Well, that's a rather difficult thing to explain. Take your time. Oh, I know the owner of this boxcar, very intimately. The owner of this boxcar happens to be my boss. Yes? Well, is she expecting you? Well, not exactly. You see, I-- Oh, I see. You were going to surprise her, huh? Yes, that's right. That won't do, sister. You should have said your father owned the railroad or somethin'. Well, he is a stockholder. That's quite a coincidence. Just the same, you're gettin' off at the next stop. Well, now that we've got that settled, may I have a cigarette? Yeah. Stick out your tongue. What? Stick out your tongue. Oh. Here. What's your line? Line? Yeah, what do you do? Well, if you must know, I'm a cook. [Chuckling] You don't look much like a cook. Oh, cooks are looking much better these days. You out of a job? Yes. Say, didn't I hear you ask the conductor about some people you're expecting? Oh, yeah. They'll probably catch a passenger train. Do you happen to know where our next stop is? Wherever it is, sister, you're gettin' off. - Well, you already said that. - Well, we're slowin' down now. [Train Whistle Blowing] What's the matter? You lose somethin'? No. - What was it? - Nothing. [Cuddles Bellowing] Mm-hmm. I found it. Get that pail of water. Oh, I'm sorry. [Bellowing] Quiet, Cuddles, quiet. You're all right. Now relax. Whoa, relax. Whoa, relax. [Bellowing] All right, now, quiet. Quiet! Quiet! What's the matter with you? Haven't you got any sense at all, wavin' a red flag at a bull? It's a scarf. He might've broken his leg. Well, I'm sorry. I should think you would be. Well, I said I'm sorry. [Brakes Squealing] Well, I'm sorry, too, but here's where you get off. Well, it'll be a pleasure. - Would you mind helping me down? - That will be a pleasure. [Thunderclap] Where's the station, please? About 11 miles up. Thank you. Where ya goin', sister? Kind of wet out there. Come on in, baby, where it's nice and warm. [Shrieks] Hey, a dame. Hey, toots! [Train Whistle Blowing] Hello. You remember me? Mm-hmm. You're back, huh? I always heard that Westerners were chivalrous, or was that just a rumor? Look, lady, I'm a cattleman. A cattleman takes care of cattle. I think what you're lookin' for is a ladies' man. That lets you out. [Chuckling] It sure does. Well, what'll I do now? Mmm, take off your clothes. Well, they're wet, ain't they? You've got some dry stuff in here. Yes, I have. Well, then, put 'em on.

Doggone it, I told you I don't know nothin' about this deluxe travel. Well, for a beginning, you're doin' all right. Better get on. She's movin'.

Aren't you joining me? No, I had breakfast earlier with, uh, Cuddles. Oh. Did ya sleep all right? Tossed all night. You did not. How do you know? Oh, well, I woke up once or twice myself, and I sort of looked over. Nice of you. Why, I'm like that, you know. I never could pass a stray cat without pickin' it up and totin' it back to its mama. That's terribly sweet, but I'm not a stray cat. Well, no offense. And I haven't got a mama. Oh, that's too bad. Don't worry about me. I'm getting off at the next station. Ah, okay. I don't know what kind of a town it'll be, but I wanna wish you luck. Thanks. It's good coffee. Considering that I didn't make it myself. Why don't you stay on, and then, uh, tomorrow you could make it. Why, I thought you were trying to get rid of me. Oh, I don't know. I'm gettin' kind of used to you. Uh-uh. Well, of course, I know it's none of my business, but it's kind of tough on a girl in a small town. Especially when nobody knows her. Why don't you wait 'til we get to Kansas City? Why? What's Kansas City got? Well, for one thing, it's got an aunt of mine. Maybe she could find a job for ya, or kind of take care of you 'til you got one. Show me how to do that? Oh, sure. Here. Like this, with your wrist. There ya are. This is fun. Well, we're stopping. Where are we? No place. Just a siding, I guess. Must have pulled up to let a passenger train through. I gotta go see the conductor. Say, uh, what's your name? Lois. Lois Hall. Lois. Huh. Sort of a fancy name for a cook. Well, mine's Larabee. Jeff Larabee. Probably can't boil water. Hey, mister. Come here. I wonder if you'd do something for me. Sure, lady. First telegraph station we come to, will you send this off? And keep the change. Sure. Thank you. [Train Whistle Blowing] Any luck, Shorty? No, she wouldn't fall for the hard-luck story. [ Bellowing, Snorting] [Bellowing] Jeff! Jeff! - [ Bellowing] - Hey! Wait a minute! - [ Doris Screaming] - Hey, Cuddles! Wait for me! [ Bellowing] [Screaming] Hey, put down that red scarf! Take it off! That's about the dumbest trick I've ever seen. Well, if you think I was doing tricks-- That bull tried to kill me. He isn't safe. I think he's positively insane. Don't talk about his brains. I thought any fool knew better than to wave a red rag in front of a bull. I didn't wave it; I wore it. And it isn't a rag; it came from Paris. And I don't dress to please bulls. Well, you better start or else stop travelin' with him. Cuddles didn't look you up. Look here-- Put that thing away! You're the most hoity-toity cook I've ever seen. [Train Whistle Blowing] Hey! That's perfect. That's fine. First you start a fire. Then you darn near break my bull's leg, and now you make me lose my train. I did? I oughta put you off last night. I wish you had. So do I. You're nothin' but a doggone nuisance. Thanks. Which way you going? I'm goin' that way. Then I'm going that way. Good-bye. Good-bye. Come on, fella. Now we're gettin' somewhere. [Chuckling] Ah, women always get ya in trouble. All right, jump in. Oh-ho, wait just a minute. Hey, what do you think I am? No, no! Hey! No, the bull don't ride! Look! We tow him! [ Horn Honking] Going my way, mister? Funny thing. I didn't have any intention of getting a new car this year, but then when I saw this, I just couldn't resist it. Much nicer than that old boxcar I've been running around in. Do you often go around pickin' up cars like this? Oh, that's the only way I ever get a car. On impulse. See it and take it. That's me. Don't the police ever bother you? Oh, quit arguing. Three can ride as cheaply as one. Why don't you tell me where you got this thing? Maybe I can square it. You don't know it, but doggone it, you're bein' a criminal. Oh, yes, and your bull is being an accessory. Seriously, I can't go on alone, now can I? I don't see why not. Girl like you has nothin' to worry about. If you run out of gas, you'll hold up a filling station. Well, good-bye. You already said that. Oh, poor Cuddles. He'll probably develop foot-and-mouth disease from all this walking and arguing. And how are you feeling? Aw, come on. Get in. No. Come on. Aw, get in. No! No! Well, come on. Step on it. We might cross the state line before we get arrested. Lay off of me, will ya? I told ya all she give me was five dollars. The Big Brain has got it. Gimme that five dollars. Five dollars. How'd you mugs like to cut in on $10,000? Why, this dame's old man is a millionaire. And you're talkin' about five dollars! What's five dollars? Hey, hey, Big Brain. You ain't figurin' no snatch, now are ya? Shh! What's the matter? These walls have ears. Now the way I handle it, it's strictly legal. All we gotta do is keep our eyes on the little bimbo... 'til Papa announces the reward in the papers. Then we wires him and cash in. Slick, ain't it? Oh, sure, it's slick, but it's too late. The dame is gone. She got off at the last stop. [Train Whistle Blowing] Gimme the five dollars. Wait a minute, Narrow Gage. The first time the train slows down, be ready to jump. We're gonna beat it back to that dame and easy riches. Here ya are, Shorty. Oh, it's you again. [Train Lurching] Oh-ho. I didn't think you cared. Lady, don't your face ever do nothin' but pucker? The only time it looks like a face is when I pucker. Oh, I don't know. I think you've got one of the prettiest faces I ever saw. I just keep lookin' at ya all the time. I declare, it just looks like I can't take my eyes off of you. I'd be lookin' at ya right now if I wasn't butterin' my bread. I think you got somethin' there. You know-- Boy, it looks like you got somethin'. You sure didn't pucker that time. Here, you take the slice and give me the bite. Your steak, sir. Ma'am, your Grapenuts. Kinda late to be shakin' hands. Buck Eaton's my name. What's yours? Emma Mazda. But don't mind what I say, 'cause I got one of those mushroom personalities. Oh-ho. On account of I work at Lacey's Basement Store. You live at home with your folks, do ya? Sure, cutie. But our family ain't all on the surface. We really go deep. I got a brother that came West to be a miner. 'Course, he couldn't find an opening, so he became a cowboy. I'm goin' West to visit him. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to tell ya all that. I guess the hole in the mountain just got me, kid. Yeah, it kinda looks like it got my steak too. It's about time you were bringin' that. If I hadn't nibbled this gentleman's knickknacks, I would've starved. Your check, miss. I knew you'd bring the check on time. Well, thank you. You ain't much company, but you're generous, and that's a fine thing in a man. That's what I always say. We're almost in my station. I asked you to bring my coffee early. Now I can't even wait for it to cool. It's scalding! Here ya are, lady. If you're in a hurry, take mine. It's already saucered and blowed. Oh!

What was she like? She was a fine girl. She was beautiful, but-- But what? But her father owned half the oil in Oklahoma. I got to thinkin' it over, and-- I'm in no position to marry or settle down. I got my ranch to build and pay for, and besides, I couldn't support her like she was used to. Is that so important? It was to me. I mean, a man ain't much of a man to let his father-in-law keep him. What happened to the girl? She got married. Say, what are you askin' me all these questions for? Oh, just curious. Well, how 'bout yourself? You ever been in love? No. No, that's the funny part of it. I never even thought I was.

He's too valuable to be left outdoors at night. Might catch cold. Back, back. I wonder if there's a stall for me too. Oh, I don't want anything elaborate. Just something simple. You know, you might enjoy the trailer. Now me, I was figurin' to bed down with Cuddles here. This is the place. It's bound to be in the papers tomorrow. All we gotta do is detain her until mornin'. Detain her. Oh, no, nix. Not with that. Come on now. Very quietly. I'll stay here. Wabash, you go first. I gotta think. - [Squeaking, Crunching] - What's that? Hey, what happened? That'll hold 'em 'til morning. Come on. Let's go. What's the matter? He's caught up with you. The guy you stole that car from. Oh, I didn't steal it. Let's not go into that again, but the door is locked. Why? He's gonna keep you here 'til he gets back with the sheriff. What would the sheriff want me for? I don't know. Probably for not stealing a car. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna try and get out of here. [Snapping Fingers] Say, you got that red scarf? Yes, I think so. Come on, Cuddles. [ Bellowing] Look out! Hurray! Shh! Quiet! Come on. "Doris Halloway Missing." As if we didn't know. "5,000 Reward." "Heiress to millions disappeared on weddin' night." Well, it all worked out just like I predicted. And we've got the girl. All we gotta do is cash her in for five grand. I oughta make a lot of little brains out of that big one. Now, Wabash! You get discouraged too easy. We'll catch up with 'em all right. Why? I just had to conk somebody. [Train Whistle Blows] Hey, hey! What's the idea of puttin' me off in a vacant lot? Say, are you followin' me? Yeah-- No! Where you goin', honey? I'm goin' to Fryin' Pan Ranch because my brother works there. Well, I'll take you there myself, sister. That's where I belong too. Fact, some of the boys are sure to be here to meet me. [Whinnying] "Dear Buck: Enclosed please find your horse." I guess the boys couldn't wait for me. Taxi! Taxi! Hey, the closest taxi stand is in Tucson. They can probably hear ya all right, but it'd take 'em two days to get here. Oh, why did I ever come out here? I wanna tell you, honey, this is God's country. Nothin' but sunshine. [Thunder Rumbling] Yeah, remind me to send a bucket of sunshine back to the folks. I don't think we better try to make it to the big ranch in this weather on one horse. But we can make it to my little ranch all right. Well, I never been on a horse before. Here's your suitcase. It's kinda hard to hang on and hold a suitcase. I'm awful sorry about that. You better take the other one too. It'll help you keep your balance. Gee, thanks, kid. [ Horse Whinnying] Wha-Wha-- What happened? I think we've stopped. How did we get on this cattle trail, anyhow? The highway was closed. I had to detour. [Doris] Oh, look. There's a house. Maybe we can go up there. No, I know that place. There's nobody up there. Well, come on. Dig! Hey! Hey! Ya dummy! You're backin' up! What are you yelling at me for? You're in your beloved West, aren't you? Why don't you lie down and wallow in it? Out where the gears shift a little harder, and the dust is a little thicker and the mud a whole lot deeper. Where a girl rates a little lower, and a bull rates a little higher. And the men are a whole lot-- a whole lot awfuller. That's where the West begins. Well, maybe you better go on up in the house then. [Gunshot] Jeff! Jeff! There, there, honey. There, there. Oh, go away. Come on. We'll just go up to that house and take care of you. Don't go in there. Why not? It's my house. But somebody tried to shoot me. He almost hit me. There's a murderer in there. [ Laughing] Oh, no. Take it easy, honey. You just walked into an old-fashioned Western gun trap. A gun trap? Sure. Grandpa set it for Grandma. Well, the men in your family! [ Laughing] Gee, I'm sorry about the shotgun goin' off and scarin' you and everything. Oh, that's all right. You know, that darn fool Buck must've reloaded it. He's been up here lately, all right. I can tell by the dirt around. I'm afraid Buck ain't much of a housekeeper. Aren't they cute! Oh, these? Yeah, they belonged to Grandma Jill Larabee. Gosh, she was sure set on 'em. You know she wouldn't come West without 'em? Shut up! What do ya think this is, a tourist camp? Ya oughta be in bed, the both of you. And besides, you're trespassin', and ya gotta scram. W-W-What are you doin' here? I'll show ya! Buck! Buck! - Buck! - Buck? Buck! Hey, Buck! Come up here! Oh, Emma, you're gettin' prettier ever' day. [Emma] Buck! Hey, Buck! Well? What's the matter, sugar pie? Oh, what are you doin' here? I'm waitin' for an explanation. Uh, when you've thought of it, I'd be glad to hear it. Why, hello,Jeff. Oh, you mean her. Oh, well, I can explain that. You see, I wanted to come out here on a hog train, but, uh, Emma here, uh-- Well,Jeff, I hope you don't think there's anything between, uh-- Oh,Jeff, now you know I ain't no romantic man. Eh, the menfolks in my family never was much of a hand for romance. But I had an uncle down home; he went with a girl one time... for, uh-- Oh, he went with her for, uh-- Let's see now. What did he go with her for? Travel sure broadens a person. Especially travel on a horse. Ah, a horse ain't so bad, if you meet him halfway. Halfway? Well, why wasn't the horse upholstered? I did my part. Bein' partners is a whole lot like bein' married. You worry about the most triflin' things-- You worrying about me? No offense, ma'am, but, well, uh-- You take Emma for instance. She's a steady, sensible girl. She's got a job back East and a family. You know where you stand with her, but-- But you know nothing about me. No, and as far as I can see, Jeff don't neither. No offense now. Oh, not at all. As a matter of fact, I'm glad you brought that up. You see, I'm in love with Jeff. In love with him? Yes, and I've lied to him. You have? Well, at least I haven't told him the truth. That's why I asked you to ride with me. Maybe you can tell me what to do. Hi, fellas! Yoo-hoo! Who are they? I don't know them either. Hi, kids. Hey, that's the cowboy we've been trailin'. But he switched girls on us. He has, huh? Well, maybe you think we could get five grand for this one. Did you see her? Not in Confederate money. Come on. We gotta find out what happened to the money baby. Why, I've crossed the continent with Jeff, and it wasn't easy. I've pumped up tires in a covered wagon. And I've ruined manicures cooking over campfires. And in spite of his prejudices, I'm going to be a pioneer too. When are you gonna tell him? First time I see him. I wouldn't, miss. It ain't hard to confess a thing to Jeff if you wait for the right time. Now take me, for instance. I knew he was gonna be mad because I missed that train. But you notice I didn't bust right out with an explanation the minute I seen him. That wouldn't have done no good at all. I waited for the right time. I never said a thing 'til about 4:00 this mornin'. And he was awful nice about it. Never said a word. Just kept right on snorin'. So, if I was you, miss, I'd marry him first... and then tell him, well, whenever you get around to it. Arizona, I am here! Yoo-hoo! Yippee! Welcome, stranger. Hiya, Shorty. Hello,Jeff! Well, if it ain't Mischa. Boys, this is Emma, friend of Buck's. He'll be along soon. Hi, kids. Ain't she somethin'! This is Gila, Shorty, Socks, Bickie-- Hey, what's that? Why, that's Mischa, our Russian cowboy. I used to be a Cossack. But the revolution... [Spits, Snaps Fingers] laid me off. Take care of her, will ya, boys? Come on, Shorty. Wanna look the place over? Sure, Jeff. My brother. Where's my brother? I'm lookin' for my brother! What's your brother's name, lady? Well, I ain't seen him in 20 years, but his name used to be Mazda. Wild Horse Mazda. Yoo-hoo! Let me see my great, big, sunburned brother. Can she mean Gopher Mazda? I'm afraid so. This way. Yoo-hoo! No, ma'am, we ain't heard a word from Miss Ryland since she left for New York. Well, that's strange. Is there a telephone I could use? Yes'm. Right in the ranch house. I'll show ye. Oh, thanks. Hello. Operator, get me New York, please. Butterfield-8-2598. No, ma'am. Your father no get-um telegram. He plenty worried. Follow you-- Just a little well I dug this mornin'. Plenty deep too. Gosh, Brother. Ain't it a beauty? Hey, hold on there, Emma. Don't be tempted. You know your family failin'. Seems to me you're takin' a mighty high hand with my sister. Say, what's this fella to you? Oh, boy. Oh, so you're tryin' to undermine my baby sister, huh? Now listen, Gopher. Don't go puttin' on your track shoes and jumpin' at conclusions. Why, I didn't even know Emma's name 'til the day after we started kissin'. Oh, yeah, man. Where's my irons? Hand me my shootin' irons! Where's my pick? Where's my shovel? Gopher, ya got me all wrong. I've been holdin' a protectin' arm around your sister. Dynamite! Dynamite is what I'm gonna use on you! Yippee! Gopher, stop your bellowing. You make me nervous. I can't think of no words when you keep buttin' in like that. Well? Well, what I'm tryin' to tell you, you little runt, is that I made up my mind to marry your sister. Oh, boy! Oh, yeah, man! Yoo-hoo! Yippee! Oh! [Crash] Wait. Better let her be for a few moments. At a time like this, a girl likes to be alone with her dreams. I think he's right. Hey,Jeff, how about a little celebration?
