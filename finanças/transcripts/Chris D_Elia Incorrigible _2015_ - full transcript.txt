Hey. Ok. Let me some stuff, ok? Yeah, this is a good crowd. What's up? I'm so happy I'm here in Los Angeles. I'm home and that's awesome man. I'm so happy. Thank you for coming out. It's cool man. This is so cool man. I'm happy. I never really know how to start this shit, but I... I don't know. I got... I been... Well, fuck it. It's cool... I've been this tour... I don't know. Ok here's the deal. I've been doing stand-up for a while now. Like for eight and a half years. And when I first started, nobody gave a shit. People don't care. You are like, "I want to do stand-up", people are like, "Eat dicks". Nobody gives a shit. Nobody cares about some dude who thinks he's funny. I've played the worst gigs ever. Like just straight up like, laundromats, for real. Like open mics, in laundromats, for real. Where people would be like folding laundry. And they'd would look over at you and be like, "Why does that asshole have a microphone?" And then I'd have to be like, "Hey, what's the deal with cell phones?" Or whatever. I try to make that guy forget about doing his laundry for a few seconds. You know? Just to make a joke. I played gigs man. Like I played gigs deep... I think the worst gig I ever had was deep in the valley of ​​Los Angeles. No, don't... You know... It was... It was so deep in the Valley... I feel like... You how know like the valley just keeps going. If your about to get to the edge of the Valley... People will beat you there and be like, "Hey, we gotta make more Valley, let's do this". "Hurry up." "Put up a Verizon wireless store. Just the front part." "Who cares, nobody goes in." "Put up a Lamps Plus, do it!" Fucking Lamps Plus. Know what I mean? Fuck that place, straight up. Lamps Plus what? You know? Can I get lettuce there? No! Fucking Lamps Plus what? Oh, more lamps? Fuck you, your not even trying. Your not even fucking trying. But this gig I played was like the worst... It was like the most rundown, shitty bar ever. Fuck a theater. This was a bar that was rundown, and all boarded up and shitty. The only thing this bar sold was meth. Like that's all it sold. This was before Breaking Bad. Before meth was popping. And by the way ok, there's 14 people in this bar. 14 people, alright. You know like sometimes, at least for me, it's hard to tell how many people are a group of people. Like, I could be at Dodger's Stadium and be like... "This is either 50,000 people, or 12 million people." I have no fucking idea. My point is, 14 people is very easy to tell. It's just 13 more than you. You'd be like, "One, 14. That's it, that's how many that is." And 12 of these people are at the bar. They're not even fucking facing me. There's just 12 of these people, are literally just lined up. Sitting at... They know I'm back there. There doing like a, "Fuck you sit". Like one of them was like that even. Just drinking and doing meth, or whatever. And I'm behind them trying to be like, "Hey what's the deal with cell phones?" Or whatever. Trying to do the shit I learned from the laundry mat. This one person, she's this lady that's facing me. And she's this big fat beast of a woman. Every time I say this lady is fat in my act, people I can feel are like, "Whoa don't say that." Like they're being judgmental. Fuck you, ok. What, there no are fat people? There are fat people. And lady was one of them. There's nothing wrong with that, but that's how she was. And it wasn't my fault either. I just seen this lady now for the first time ever. Like I was never, "Hey, fucking you, eat more". "Do it!" "I got your family at home, you do that shit and act like..." She took it upon herself to just, "Mah mah mah mah." And then just, "Boing boing" like that. And I fucking just met her now ok. So quiet with that fucking judgmental shit, alright? She was this, big, fat, beast... To her credit, she also looked very strong. Like a strong but fat. Like fat strong. You know what she looked like? Like a bro, do you know what I mean? You know the bro that, like wears a backwards hat in the pool or some shit? You know that dick, right? The kinda guy that is like, works out and talks about it all the time. But also doesn't do enough cardio. Like he'll still wear a tight shirt and your like, "Yo bro, your pushing that shit" Like relax. The kinda guy that will post a picture of himself working out. And post it on Instagram and then hashtag it, "Beast Mode". That fucking guy ok. Where like you would see it in your feed, and you'd be like, "Nah, not Beast Mode. Asshole". "Regular human mode. Because you work at Chase Bank. and there's no beasts that work there." So this fucking fat beast of a woman was... And by the way, she was 50 years old! She was a 50 year old lady! Her face and body were 50, and she had this crazy frizzy hair that was going everywhere. Like her hair was going every which way. And this 50 year old strong lady, but fat and this crazy frizzy hair. She wouldn't shut up. Like she was talking the whole time I was on stage. And right now your like, "Hey wait a minute! You said that there were 14 people. There were 12 people at the bar, you were 1. And she makes 14. Who was she talking to?" Nobody, she was a fucking crazy person! She was talking the whole time I was on stage. I got so fed up that in the middle of my act, I stopped, I looked at her and I said. "Hey Blanka, shut the fuck up!" You know... You remember Blanka from Street Fighter II? Alright. Now the younger people are the people who laughed at that joke. Because you remember that video game. Your like, "Ah shit, yah, I remember that". But the older people in the audience right now are like, "Yo, I don't know what the fuck your talking about." But that's why I thought this Dis was going to be the best Dis ever. Because I thought it was going to sail over her frizzy 50 year old head. Hit the 12 much younger people at the bar. They would going to hear the Dis and be like, "Street Fighter II? I remember that video game." Get curious, turn around, see the lady laugh and I was going to win the room. The only person in there who knew who Blanka was in this bar, was this lady. She got so mad, like way too mad. She got angry as fuck. It was like the moment she woke up that morning, the first thought she had was, Bing! "Nobody better call me Blanka today!" She got so mad that she actually charged me. She for real, left her conversation with nobody. And it was so rude to the people that weren't there. She got up and started charging me. In my head that's how it was, on all fours. Just like that. And I thought, maybe for a split second, I was like, "Yo, maybe this is the real life Blanka." But I didn't know what to do. Like here in the theater, I could go out the exit way. The secret back door, whatever. This was a rundown shitty bar in the Valley. There was nowhere to go. I just like, cowered in the corner. I thought she was going to get closer. Do the electricity move. To where I got too close and just... my bones are flashing. "Round two, fight!" That's Beast Mode ok. The whole reason why I'm telling you that story is, thanks for coming out. So I don't have to fucking deal with that shit anymore. Yeah so. It's cool man. You know. I get to do this shit now. I'd just like to end of my tour. I've been doing all sorts of like... I've been traveling everywhere. All over America. Like it's crazy. I ah... Your just rooting for America, that's you back there? Woo, yeah, anywhere! Wherever you are or aren't... "Anywhere in the America!" I've been traveling every...it's crazy... I just got back from South Florida. And that shit is... They party hard. They never don't party. By the way, everybody's Cuban. I don't give a shit. Even if your not Cuban, your secretly Cuban there. Even tall white blonde dudes will trick the shit out of you. You'd be like "Oh, pardon me," you'd be like: "That's okay. How's it going my friend? How are you?" "Bet you thought I was Swedish or some shit?" "No no no!" In their head, always. Cubans love being Cuban. You'll never meet... for real. You'll never meet a Cuban... And you'd be like, "Are you Cuban?" And they'll react like this, "Yes, I am Cuban." "Just kidding!" "Jokes on you!" I got lost down there in Miami. By the way, don't ever ask a Cuban for directions. Unless you want to have the best time of your life. I got lost, I was like: "Hey man, how do I get to where I was supposed to go?" He goes like this, "This is what I want you to do my friend." "Come this way. Come this way." " My friend, come this way." "I'm going to tell you which way to go," "So we have the same... I lied, come closer." "Come closer to me." "I want you close to me, come closer!" I was fucking right here. “I want you closer than that." "I want you so close, if you were any closer, you'd be me." "That's how close I want you." "Come here, this is how we're going to do this" ok. "This is how we're going to do this." " Come closer, come closer." "Here's how we're going to do." Mwah. "Got you. OK, look." "Whaaat?" "No, I'm not going to kiss you. Come this way." "This is how we're going to do this, okay? This is how we're going to do, alright?" "Ok, imagine... this is what I want you to do, okay?" "Imagine we are here. You got to imagine. Imagine..." "Imagine you are here. Imagine..." He kept saying, "Imagine we are here." Yo dude, you don't have to imagine we are here. We fucking are here. “No Bud, you got to imagine. I want you to imagine into my eye." "This is how we're going to do. Were going to start out right away." "Bang! That's how we're going to start. Bang! We're going to start this way." "Bang! And then all of a sudden we're going to go this way. Bang, that's what we're going to do ok." "Bang and then bang. That's what we're going to do." "Bang and for three blocks, bang bang bang." "And at the end of the 3rd block, we're going to go this way." "Bang, that's what we're going to do. Ok?" "Then two more blocks, bang, bang, and then all of a suddenly, bang." "That's what we're going to do." Hey, every direction was bang. I didn't know what the fuck... I was like, ok. "Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang." "Are we fucking the whole way there?" Like, I don't know. "Yes!" "You better believe we're gonna fuck the whole way there." "I'm going to fuck you the whole way there." Cubans love being Cuban. They are so fucking excited. It's hilarious. You know what the opposite of Cubans are? Russians. Straight up. They don't give a fuck. They're mad always. You will never met a happy Russian, ever. I can prove it right now. You never once in your life heard a Russian go like this: "Oh my God, no way, fucking awesome." That's why your laughing, you agree with that shit. Did you ever see a Russian outside of Disneyland? "Hurry up, is the whole crew here here?? "Let's go on rides, go, go! Come on, let's go, go, go!" No! They just stand outside of Disneyland like, "Fuck this bullshit. I hate this place." "Fuck you. Fuck this place. I hate this." Mickey and Mini Mouse, worst couple ever. I don't care." "Shittiest place on earth." "I see roller coaster go by. I follow them. Fuck ya, I don't care." "Bye, bye!" "Oh you coming back for more!?" "Asshole!" "I see you doing loops." "Asshole, dizzy bitch, fuckhead!" Russians are mad dude. Dude, they're so... They never... They just... Fuck it. I used to live in the Valley, I moved. There were so many Russians where I was like. That... it was like... Russia. Like there were... I go to this coffee shop every day. I would go to this coffee shop every day. And 12 Russians would show up on motorcycles. Every single day. At like 1PM, they would all show up and I'd wait for them. And every time they showed up, they were pissed off, always. Like so mad, for no reason. It was like they just drove everyday from their divorce attorney. Like that's how it was. "We had bad meeting. "Going to have to give wife half of my shit." "Let's go get coffee, 12 of us." Like that's how it was. "I kept..." I like that logic. "I have to..." "I have to give my wife $20,000. Let's go get coffee. 12 of us." And they'd be pissed off. They show up on the motorcycles, and they get off the motorcycles, like they hated motorcycles. They would just get off and be like: "Fuck this bullshit. I hate this." "Asshole way of transportation." "Fuck you. I don't care." "I wish I had more wheels." Fuck ya. "But my wife took the other two. I don't care" And then they walk into the coffee shop, like they hate coffee. They just walk in like: "What is this bullshit?" "What is this asshole menu?" "Where is barista? Come here, barista." "This way. Fuck you. But come here. But fuck you. But come here." "But fuck you though." "Mainly fuck you, but also come here." "In your asshole. Come here." "What is this bullshit drink? Fuck that bullshit drink." "Fuck you drink. I want one of those." "And I want to drink it but also fuck you. I don't care." They walk always... They walk around like this way. So you know they're mad. Like fucking. "Chin down." "Chin tucked in, and down." "Chin... Fuck my own chin. I don't care." "Chin tucked in and down. Chest out, chin down." "Minimal neck exposure. I don't care." "Neck is for friends and family only." "Neck is like mafia. You get in, nobody comes out." " Chest up for self-confidence, chin down for 'Fuck you!' " They're just mad. Russians are mad about like... Everything about Russians is, "fuck you". They're the only language with a backwards "R". Like how the fuck... did that even come up? "Here's what we're going to do. Come here. Gather around. Listen up." "Come here. I have letters. Boris come here. Listen." "We take 'R'. Regular standard American English 'R'." "Boris, come here. We take 'R', regular standard 'R'..." "Boris, come here. We take 'R', turn it around." "It's now backwards 'R'." "Fuck you 'R'!" "Fuck 'R'. Right in your asshole. Yes!" "Come here, there are more letters. Come here. I have ideas." "Come here. We take 'O', regular standard 'O'..." "Come here. Boris, we take 'O', put lines through it. Fuck you 'O'." "Fuck 'R' and 'O'. Right there. We don't care." "Wait, I'm not done. There are more letters. Come here." "Come here. We take 'H', turn it upside down. Fuck you 'H'." "Of course upside down 'H', technically still looks like 'H'. "They don't know, but we know." I love dumb shit. Like silly shit makes me laugh. I love it because my favorite shit like that is like... Like if you know me, you've seen me before, you know I do silly like shit. Like you'll see that bit right there. And you'd be like, "Oh ya that's kinda like his style. "Silly that's why I'm here." But my favorite... My favorite part about that is like, not everybody is here because you want to be. You know what I mean? Some of the people here, got dragged by the people that wanted to see me. That shit is hilarious. Because, here's why: Because you saw that bit and you're like, "Yo, what's this asshole talking about?" And that is the best because, I already have your money. Do you know what I mean? I'm going to buy stuff with it. I don't know. Oh, actually this is how I wanted to start the show. I fucked it up a little bit. But... I don't know. This is how I wanted to start. I wanted to start with a message, a statement kinda. Like it's not even a joke, for real. Its a... A statement and it goes like this: It's for girls, first of all. You're not going to like it. Cheer later. This is a statement. It goes like this: Hey, girls! Relax. Ya, no joke. That's it. Just because... Because you don't. Know what I mean? You don't. You don't. For instance, every second all of the days that ever happened. You don't like... You don't! Girls get stressed out for no reason, right? You run into a girl... You run into a girl and you're just: "GRRRR!" They just fucking: "GRRRR!" "Like, what wrong?" "- I'm having the most stressful day." "Like it's 7:45AM." What are you talking about? "Nothing could have happened yet." "I know, but fucking GRRRR!" "What?" "- I can't." "You can't what?" "- I can't even." "You can't you even, what?" "Why are you doing this word by word? Do the whole sentence." "Rip that band-aid off. I don't know what happened." Girls get stressed out for no reason. One time a girl told me this... She looked at me and she goes like this. This is what she said. She looked at me she goes like this: "- You wouldn't even know what happened, even if I told you" "What, are you going to say it in Arabic? I don't know what you mean." "Like, did a dragon fuck you?" "If a dragon fucked you, talk slow, 'cause I need to comprehend." "- I was at the market and a dragon fucked me." "You're right, I have no fucking idea what that means." Girls get stressed out for no reason. I invited people over to my place the other day. And two girls called me separately from outside of my house, from different cars, all stressed out. And this is what they we're stressed out about: "- Where do I park?" "What!? What do mean?" "You're on the street. You did it already, kinda." It would be like right now if I was... "Where's the microphone?" "- It's fucking right here." "Are you in the car?" "- Ya." "Okay turn it off, get out." Step one: Park, that's it. There's no other step. It's like breathing. Step one: You did it! Are you in the forest? Then I can help you. Step one: Get out of the forest. Step two: Park. That's still the main thing. "- I know but GRRRR!" Girls... I think here's what the real thing is. Girls like to get stressed out. Ok? I know that because every girl in here has said this at least three times: This week, right here. This is what girls say: You go like this: "- I've been literally been running around all day." No, you fucking haven't. Ok? First of all, you drove everywhere you went to. Alright. "- I've been literally running around..." I'd like to think about a girl all day literally just like: "- LAH LAH LAH LAH, LAHHH" That's running around all day, literally. Alright. That's actually the least stressful thing you can possibly do. You know who does that? A child does that, ok. A child can literally shit his pants and not be stressed out about that. So you're not stressed out. Girls get stressed and it's good though. Because girls care. Girls really care and that's awesome. Because guys, don't give a fuck. Girls care, and dudes are like: "Nah, it's going to be cool." Girls are like, "No, it's not." And dudes like, "Trust me, it's going to be fine." And girls like, "No no no." And you're like, "Ya ya ya, it's going to be fine." And that's it. "- No no no, but..." "- Alright, I break up with you." 'Cause girls care to a fault. You know. You really do. Alright guys, you know when you're hanging out with your friends? And there's like four of you or whatever. And then there's one girl that's hanging out with you and she's just around. And like one of you starts picking on one of your other friends. You'd be like, "Hey, dude you're a fucking loser." "Fuck you, loser." And then the other dude might join in and be like, "- Yeah, he's right. Fuck you!. "- You're a loser, Ha ha ha." "We both agree on that." And then the third dude would come in and be like, "Yo, those two dudes are fucking right, loser!" "You suck, you know."" Then then the girl would be like, "No come on, he's not a loser." The guys joking, you just made that shit real. Now I have to help him get a job. Like what the... I'm never stressed out. I just don't care. I think it's actually a problem. Like for real. I think it is a problem. I kinda feel like... Like I feel a little bit like I'm a bit of a sociopath or whatever. Ok, here's one thing like... I've watched every episodes of Dexter. I love that show. It's a good show. It's a real good show. I watched every episode but during every episode, I'd watch that and I'd be like, "Yeah, that's the right move, Dexter." I would do that exactly. Like that's... wrong you know. Whatever. But I didn't give a fuck, that's the whole point. Like I don't care. Like even when friends come up that you care about, right. They'll come up to you ask for advise about stuff. They'd be like, "Hey, you know I don't what to do." "I think maybe my girl is hanging out with another dude." "What do I do?" I'll do the face where I'm like, "Ahh nooooo!" "Ah come on man. Go get 'em!" Or whatever. But in my head, I'm for real thinking things like. "Mmmm. What about my penis?" "Poop comes out of my butthole sometimes." I don't care! I think that makes me a bad person. Like for real. I don't care. I just don't care. I got into an argument a little bit kinda recently. You ever get into an argument? And in the middle of the argument your like: "Oh ya, I don't give a fuck about this." Right? But by the way that's always where I'm always at. Like if we ever get into a conversation, and you get to the point where you go like this. "Huh? Nah uh!" I'm just going to go like this, "Yeah, your probably right," Like that's how much I give a fuck. That being said, ok. I've dated a lot of girls that love to argue. Which probably secretly means mean I like to argue. But we're not going to talk about that right now, ok. All I'm saying is that if you keep running into the same problem. You're the problem. Do you know what I mean? But cares about my my therapist? The other day this happened ok. I was walking down the street. I was wearing my favorite bright orange shirt. It's my favorite shirt. It's bright, it's orange, I wear it all the time. As I'm walking down the street I notice a girl I used to date and kinda hang out with, walking in my general direction. I immediately did what anybody in this room would have done given this circumstance. I go like this, "Oh fuck!" Because I didn't want to run into her because I remember our history. And we're definitely going to argue. So I got a plan. I'm going to cross the street. That was my whole plan ok. But then I realized, I'm wearing my favorite bright orange shirt. I'm a asshole, she's going to spot me trying to get away. And that's what's going to start the argument. She's going to be like, "Oh my God! Where are you going?" "You're such an asshole! I see you, you're trying to avoid me!" "You never change!" or whatever. And then I'm going have to fucking kill her like Dexter. "You know what, abort that plan." "I'm just going to do this kamikaze mission and see what the fuck goes down. Hope for the best." As I'm walking down the street. I noticed that the girl is walking with an older lady. And they approached me and the girl sees me and goes like this: "Hey, Chris. Oh my God!" "How are you? I haven't seen you in so long!" That's how she sounds in my head. Then she refers to the older lady and she goes like this, "This is my mom." Ok. I've never met this girl's mom before in my life. I've never seen her, I don't know her. So just like in a cute way I looked at the lady and I go like this, "Oh hey, what's up mom? How are you?" And the girl goes like this: "Woah woah woah woah. No no no no." "Not your mom, my mom." Yup, bitch no shit. Do you know what I mean? What kind of lunatic would I have to be, if all of a sudden I thought that this woman was the one I came out of? Just like, "Woah, no way! Mom?" "Get out of here!" "You know I used to hang out with this girl?" "What a coincidence." "I used to be inside both of you!" Whatever, that's what I wanted to say. But then I would of had to kill them both like Dexter, right? So I knew she was trying to push my buttons. So I just swallowed all that, whatever I going to do. Get shitty I can't believe I heard these words come out of my mouth, but I looked at the lady and go like this: "Ah, never mind, you're not her." Whatever. I kinda lost that one. You know what I mean? But also I kinda won because I said, "I planned not to argue" and I achieved that goal. No, that's not the end of this story. This girl was right there and she wanted to fucking get her argument quota. She took that shit to the next level. She picked up my shirt, she goes like this: "Oh my God! What's the deal? "You're wearing pink shirts now huh?" "You didn't used to wear pink when we used to hang out." "What changed?" Now if you remember, in the beginning of the story, the fucking shirt was orange! Ok? But it was obviously orange. Alright? It was the daytime when I ran into the girl. Nothing was blocking the shirt between her and I. And I know the shirt was orange because when I bought this shirt I pointed to it. And I say, "How much is that orange shirt?" And the lady that worked there knew exactly what fucking shirt I was talking about. Now I'm pissed off at this point now, because I know that she's trying to push my buttons. But I didn't want to get shitty, because I know that's what she wanted. So instead... I swallowed everything I wanted to say and this is what came out my mouth. I go like this: "Well ya.. you now... waaah." You know how like that what you do sometimes instead of punching somebody in the face right? Like every energy you that have that goes into knocking this mother-fucker's head off. Swallows itself into your body and transforms itself into, "ARRRRGH." So now I'm sitting there just going, "ARRRRGH." And I can't help it, "No this is orange, AHHHH". Like I'm a fucking Sesame Street character. "O for orange." "This is near, and this is far." Girl turned me into fucking Grover. But she didn't move her feet or blink her eyes and she goes like this: "No it's not, it's pink." Now I'm so mad, right. Like actually mad. Like as mad as Blanka was. Like I felt that shit you know. I actually felt so mad that I was going to shit myself. Like that's how... And I had no control. Like my asshole was just like, "Hey, open up, fuck it, we lose." "Everything out!" And my shit was like: "Yeah, it's mad awkwardly here, get out!. "Abort! We need to be near feet more!” Or whatever. And I had to like, manually close that shit. Like my legs hook me up. My ass was like, "Fuck you bum" but my legs were like, "We got this shit!" And the shit was like, "Yo, we gotta get out someway" I felt nau.. I felt like I might... And here's the thing, alright. There's two kinds of throwing up. Alright. There's the kind of throwing up where... Your like, "I don't really feel that good." I think I got a bug. I might throw up." And then you go, "Oh here it comes, blaa" And your like, "Now I feel much better." But then there's the other kind of throwing up. Where maybe you ate something, and that shit was the bomb. Like you loved it right. And your just going about your day and your like, "Yo, that chicken so good." And then you don't know you're throwing up until you already threw up. It happens all of a sudden your like, "Yeah, that's true. Beeeyonk!" "Yeah, no, hahaha, Beeeyooonk!" Like, I felt like I was going to scream vomit all over this family. But I caught that shit. My mouth hooked me up. They were in with the legs. And they fucking... I kept that shit in. And then I realized that's probably how Russians get so mad. But through all of this I was able to just eek these words out. And I looked at her and I said: "You know what, I guess I just don't know the difference between pink and orange." And I did that because I didn't want to argue. And I didn't want to make shit weird in front of our mom. I guess the point of what I'm trying to say is like... I'm not just trying to tell some stupid story about an orange shirt. I'm trying to make a larger point here. And the point is, is like ahh... If you want to argue, you kinda have to argue. You kinda gotta let that shit out. If you don't, it's bad for you. You might end up resenting the person you're talking to. Or resenting yourself. Like it's happened a few weeks ago and I still think about it. Like if I'm being honest, I thought about it everyday. It is my favorite shirt, I told you. I've worn it since then. Every time I put it on, I'm like, "Fuck that bitch, it's orange!" Like it's so... Unhealthy. And the worst part about it is, I know she hasn't thought about since the shit went down. It was just all in a days shitty work for her. Like there's no way she's in her apartment just like, "It's pink, I don't give a fuck." Like there's no way. I wanted her to know it's orange. That's all, then I feel like I'll be fine. I want to like drive by, late at night one night with the lady that sold it to me and be like... "Honk, honk. Tell her." "It's orange, biiiitch! "Go go go go go go go!" It's weird how shit like that will piss you off. But I feel only an ex can make you that mad. Only somebody you've been intimate with can push your buttons like that. Like anybody you've been in that moment with, Where you are like, with them, like naked, that's you. That's just you, with no clothes on, and your... You know what I mean? And her shit is out, you know, or in, and you fucking... And you're on top of her. That's intimate shit. And you look in... You do eye contact. You fuck with eye contact. When you're doing it... I'll be, "Look at me." Like it's so.... You'd be like.. "I could kill you, but I'm not." "I would never do... In fact, I'm going to do the opposite." This is love. Like that's a moment that you share with that person. And later if that person is like, "Ha ha. Fuck you!" You'd be like, "What about this shit?" "When I could have killed you, and I didn't even do that." Do you guys awe like this is Full House or some shit?. Only an ex can piss you off like that. Like if my buddy, that I've never been inside of. Like if my... buddy, that I've never entered or even like, that I've always been outside of... That never... If he came up to me and was like, "Hey, nice pink shirt" I'd be like, "Fuck you" and we'd go see a movie. That's how that would go. That's pure dick on dick friendship. Like that's how that goes. But girls you can get at us like that. You really can. And here's why. Because as men, all we want in life, no matter what we do in our lives, the real reason we're doing it, is to get you. That's what we want. No matter what we do, no matter what ever it is. The real reason is to get, in you. Really. That's the truth. I know, it's true. We drive nice cars. We don't care what wheel we're behind. We just want when we drive by for you to go, "Wait, wait oh ya." Then you get in the car and then we get in you. That's what we want. We get nice jobs, we work hard, we don't care where we go everyday. We just want you to be like, "Wait a minute, what do you do?" And then we get in you. That's what we want. No matter what we do as men, the real reason we're doing it, is to get into your pussy. That shit crazy, dude. It's crazy, dude. It's harsh but it's true. But here's the craziest part about that whole thing. There's nothing in there. That means that all men want in life is nothing. That makes me want to jump off a bridge. So all I'm saying is girls, help us out to make us feel less crazy as men. Just keep shit in there. You know what I mean? It could be anything. It doesn't need to be gold. A little bird, would be amazing. Imagine though, you're hooking up with a girl, "Ya come here, take these off." "What the fuck?" "A blue jay came out, I think maybe. It's maybe a blue jay." Anything. A roll of quarters would be equally impressive. To help park when you come over! It could be half for me, half for you. Imagine if that's how it was? That would be so cool if that's how it was. If that's how sex was that would be awesome. It's already the best thing ever. Because of, cumming. No, that's awesome, "Hey dude, orgasms are so dope." They're awesome because they're always awesome. They're never not. They're never not, ever. There's nothing else like that. Like, I love cheeseburgers. But sometimes I'll eat one and be like, "Fuck that cheeseburger!" You never have an orgasm and you're like. "Ah ha ha, meh." You're always like, "Yes! Dun Ta Dah!" That's, "Level up!" That's how it feels. It feels like you get to the next level, when you have an orgasm. Dude, that feels so good. That's so funny how it always feels so good. Dudes love it too. Dudes love that shit man. I know because I'm a dude. Dudes... Dudes feel so good... We feel so good when we orgasm. Every dude, for a split second, When we have an orgasm, we become Nicolas Cage. No, for real though. All dudes... "Ah ah ah ah, puh, pwah!" "Ah ah ah..." That's so... "...ah ah, puh, pwah!" That would be so cool though if that's how sex was. Like afterwards you got a little prize. Like that would be amazing. Imagine, right when you're finishing up... "Ah ah ah, ooh!" "Oh what? A ring pop? No way!" "Get out of here, that's amazing!" "Thank you! Thank you!" Anything just... "Ah ah ah, ooh!" "No, two tickets to the Coachella? Get outta here!" "That's so cool! Thank you so much!" "For real!? Ahh baby, you're the best!" "Do I have to take you or can I take whoever I want to?" "OK, I'll take you. Chill chill cha chill chill chill." There is nothing we get out of there. We give you all the shit! We give you all the shit! And then you fucking... We're like, "Here, have this." “Anything in the..., fucking have this. A fucking pony, have that." "Have this fucking pony! And a house and have all these things!" And then you're like, "I had fun for you! Fike!" Like there's nothing...! Nothing! That's crazy. Nothing comes out of it. Well no, one thing does: A baby! WTF? No worse prize ever. Straight up, for real. Worst prize ever. Worst prize ever. Some people don't think so, eat dicks. Worst, worst... I can prove it right now. If you're on the Price is Right... and the dude is like, "You win a new baby!" You'd be like, "I wanted the yacht." "That's bullshit." "The yacht doesn't shit itself." A baby, that's crazy man. Babies come out of girls, like... That's like insane. Like that's so... We don't think about that. Why don't we think about that every minute of every day? Because that's alien shit. Like that's insane, to be like a person that walks out of another person. What, dude!? "And people want me to vote!?" People are like, "Why aren't you political?" Because A: "Because babies come out of people, that's why man." People take it for granted, people don't even think about that shit. People take it for granted, somebody would be like, "Hey, we're having a baby!" And somebody else would be like, "Is it boy or a girl?" How about the fact it's a fucking human being!? A lady, a grown lady opens up her legs, and a mini version of her just repels out. Like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible. Just, "Waah." A baby just come out like, "Hey, what's up, dude?" "I'm a baby!" "It's time for me to be on this world and fuck shit up!" "Give me a social security number and it's on baby!" A baby. A real one. And you know what? Babies ain't shit man. They're not, and people are always, "Wow, they're so amazing!" No, they're not dude. No they're not. Ok? "Whoa, how could you say that?" Because you know what's amazing? Us, adults. We do shit. We all dressed ourselves. We drove here. We built this fucking theater. Babies come out, they aren't even ready dude. They're not ready! They coming out, they're just like, "Whaaaa" "Huh, what!?" "Oh you can't talk?" "Get the fuck back up in there until you learn how to speak." "Do first grade in that pussy, at least!" Babies aren't even ready man. They're wet and shit. Wipe it off. If you have a baby ok, and you put that baby down. and you walk away for long enough, that baby dies. You, the adult needs to help that baby, and give it thinks like water and sandwiches. It needs it! Stay up in there until you can make your own fucking sandwich. That's all I'm saying. That's how other animals do it. Other animals come out ready as fuck. They come out, down for whatever. They're the Tupac of babies. When a lady deer opens up her deer... A bitch deer... I don't what you call it. A ho ass deer. When a fucking lady deer opens up her legs. A little mini version of her just comes out like, "What do you want me to do? What should I do" "I'm going to go look for berries." I'm going to look for berries." It already knows where the food is! This baby can't even make a turkey sandwich. Fuck you, shitty baby! Stay up in there until you're ready. Ok? That's how it should be for us. Women should give birth to men and women. Ok? A lady should open up her legs, and a grown dude should just plop out. With like a suit on and goatee. "Hey, I'm late for work. I gotta go." "I gotta go." "By the way, pick me up at Wells Fargo. That's where I work." A baby man. Oh man. I don't have any kids for sure, you know. I don't like, but for sure. You guys say "For sure.", because people won't believe you. They'd be like, "Ya, but maybe, you do." "You don't know. It could have totally happened." "And maybe you don't even know." "Did you ever think about that dude? You could of had one." But I know for sure. Because I'm very safe. I always wear a condom. Like, I have one on right now and... No, but I... I also do this other thing to take extra precaution. This is so stupid, but I really do this. Even though I'm wearing a condom, when I'm about to have an orgasm, I'll pretend to have the orgasm, right before the real orgasm. And then I'll still pull out, but I gotta pretend like I already, had an orgasm. Right!? So I'm trying to hide it. So like, "Yeah! BRGGG" "What wrong, are you okay? "Never better, why?" "Why would you say that? BRGGG BRGGG." So I don't have any kids man. I'm happy about that, because I'm not ready. I know the whole thing is, you're never ready until you do it. Then you just figure it out. I don't know, my buddy had a kid, and I'm trying to watch him figure that shit out. And he's just always like, "No no no." That's not how you figure shit out, you know. "Fucking shit ass!" I don't know. He had a daughter. And he's just like, "What do I do?" You fucking did it! I don't know. Don t ask me, I definitely don't know? He's all stressed out about the daughter. "How do I identify? How do I connect as a man?" To me it's scarier to have a son. A boy. If I had a boy, a kid, a son, or whatever... Because then your the man and then he comes up to you and he's like, " Wha... wha..., hey, dad." "What's up? What do I do?" "Hey, dad. What's up? What do I do?" Those would be the best first words ever. "Hey, dad. What's up? I'm here now. What do I do?" "Where are you going? You have to teach me stuffs." "Dad, come back here. I want to have a hamburger." "I'm your responsibility now. You come here." I can't show a kid, to be a man. A boy, show him how to be a man? I don't do... I'm not manly at all. I don't do manly shit. Like I cried recently. You're never supposed to cry ever. As a dude, you're never supposed to cry. No matter what happens, it's supposed to bounce off your chest or wiz by you. And then, three months later, you're supposed to be like, "I don't even barely remember what the fuck went down." You're never supposed to never cry. Maybe until like one minute right before you die, You let one tear just roll down your cheek. But before it hits your chin. You just go, "Ahhh" and you eat that shit. And people who see it. They see you die. They're like, "Wow, that dude ate his last tear." "That's the man." I try not to cry, I try to like... I try not to cry, because I have that male instinct. But I always... I'm a person. I'm a fucking emotional guy. I try not to cry, it always ends up coming out because it has to. Because I try to bottle it up. And when it does, because I do that, it happens at the weirdest time. I don't even want to tell you why I cried recently. But, fuck it... I'm going to tell you because it's part of my act. You don't have to goad me on. Ok, here's why. Have you guys seen the movie Kazaam with Shaquille O'Neal? Ok, it's an emotional journey. For those who don't know the movie, Shaquille O'Neal, the basketball player. AKA the guy who doesn't act in movies ever, because he's not an actor and he's a basketball player, acts in this movie and plays a genie. It's a real a movie, I'm not making it up. Google that shit ok. So I turned on the movie. I turned on the TV, and the movie is on already. It's the beginning of the movie. And I immediately see Shaquille O'Neal dressed as a genie. I think wow, "Fuck this movie, it looks so dumb." But I thought that for an hour and a half. Which means I definitely watched the whole movie. Then at the end of the movie, there's this really cute moment, where the little kid in the movie, looks up to Kazaam - Shaquille O'neil. And this is what he says, "- I just wanted you to know that um..." "- I consider you my friend." Hey, I lost it man. I didn't even cry like how a man is supposed to cry. Like on his knees, in slow motion. Holding his dieing friend, while choppers blazed over his head. I cried, this is the noise that came out of my mouth. "Hu hu ha." That's the most bitch noise any dude ever made in history. And I made it. Tears didn't even stream down my face, they shot the fuck out. Like I was a Japanese cartoon or some shit. "Oh wa hoo hoo..." I was embarrassed and I was alone. Do you know how embarrassed you have to be, to be alone and embarrassed? I grabbed the remote control, I changed the channel for nobody. Nobody was in the room. I blindly hit the channel up button. Do you know what was on the channel above it? Kazaam in HD. I cried harder. It was colorful and more vivid. More Japanese just, "Oh oh ooh ho..." "- Hey dad, why are you crying at him?" "- Hey dad. Hey, what's up? What?" "- Why are you crying when you're watching that movie like that?" "Fucking go to bed." "- But dad, it's 3PM." Do you know how bad that would fuck up a kid's life? At school just, "- Hey, you know?" On the playground... "- Hey, you know when your dad cries and you have to go to bed?" "Hey, Tommy. Come here." "- Hey, dude, come here." "- You know when your dad is watching a movie?" "- You know when your dad is watching a movie with a basketball player?" "- And then he ends up crying and then..." "- Then you have to go to bed at 3PM? Do you know that?" "- I'll grow up to kill people." I can't have my fucking fake son seeing me do that shit. What if he wants to play sports? "- Hey dad, I want to play football." Now I gotta fucking learn how to play football. I'm not manly. I don't even like sports. I don't care... I don't care about sports. I don't care. I tried to watch... I tried to watch the sports but I don't give a... I'd watch it if it was real bears vs real dolphins. You know what I mean like... Just bears out there, just like, "Rahh rahh." "- Dolphins on the 20 yard line, Ah ah ah ah ah ah" I would... NFL would have all my money. I would have every package on Direct TV. All of it man. Bears vs lions. You wouldn't wait all year for that ferocious match up? No, fuck that. That would be way better and you know it man. Eagles flying around, shitting all over the Buccaneers. I don't know what a Buccaneer is. But I know it would be hilarious to see a Buccaneer trying from a shitting Eagle. Money, here you go NFL, here. You know a great bad team to watch would be? The Cowboys. Because they would be just regular human beings. They'd be like, "- Hey, I hopefully we got our guns loaded correctly and we got good aim, because they got real live Jaguars out there." "- Run!" Pow pow pa pow! "- Jai jai!" Pa pow pow! You know what would be even better than Cowboys? The Texans. Because they would just be people from Texas. "- Hey, how the fuck did we get here?" "- We was at the mall! Run!" "- We don't even like playing the Cowboys, because they're like us, but they have weapons!" "- Go, run!" That's on fire! The Browns would be a family out on the field just barbecuing. "- Giants!" My favorite bad team, hands down no doubt, would be the Packers. "- Let's go, come on! Go go!" "- Grab the boxes, there's Vikings out there!" "- Go go!" "- We picked the worst day to move, run!" "- I hate moving every Sunday and sometimes Monday night depending on the scheduling, go!" I hate when I do that bit when I say a team people are like, "- Whooh!" or "- Boo!" "Like yo, chill, this is a joke." You know what I mean? "- I can't help it when he says Packers. Gotta cheer dude!" "- Gotta fucking cheer if he says Packers man!" "- No matter what happens you gotta cheer if somebody says Packers." "- That's a rule in sports ok." "- You fucking hear Packers, no matter what the fuck you're doing..." "- Hey did it start up... if you fucking... when it comes to Packers... shithead." It's the fucking people, in the sport... Do you know what I hate even more than the sport? Are dudes that paint their faces the same color as the team they like. And then go to the game and root for the team. Hey, what the fuck are you doing? Guys with kids sometimes. Like, what are you doing? Let me stop the comedy show for two seconds. So when I say this, you'll know I'm serious. If you're do that, you're a fucking dork. Back to the show. Just 100 percent, do that zero times. How about that? You got grown men that wear jerseys as fans, with other grown men's names, the players, on their own back. Then they look at that dude and they're like, "- Ya, go that guy on my back!" What the fuck!? Are you a bitch? Like what? That is a fucking bitch move. Take yourself outside of society and think about what kind of a bitch move that is. Here's a new rule. If you're a grown man and you have another grown man's on your own back, that dude get's to fuck you. I don't care. I don't care. No homo, but that's what's happening. If you're walking around town with a Wayne Gretzky jersey on and Wayne Gretzky sees you. he gets to skate up... grab you, "Bow bow ba bow bow!" and then backward skate away. The only anything worse than getting fucked in the ass when you don't want to, probably. Is when... afterwards, you see the dude is backward skating away. That would be really confusing in your life. It would be like, "- Ow! Who did that shit? Wooooah!" "- It's Wayne Gretzky!" "- Ouch but cool!" "- ouch but even though cool still a little bit." "- Hey, you know when..." "- Hey, Tommy. You know when your..." "- Hey, Tommy, want to play play football?" "- You know when you see a guy wearing another person's name on their back?" "- And then that guy gets to fuck that guy?"" "- You know about that?" "- And then your dad sees what happened," and he cries and then you have to go to bed?" "- I'm going to grow up and kill people." We can't fucking have my.... I don't... Not manly. I don't know. I can't... I've been thinking about this manly shit. I think about it a lot because I talk about it a lot and uh... No matter how manly you are, no matter how not manly you are, All dudes think they're manly when it comes to one thing. And that's having sex. Like all dudes... If you have a dick, you think you know how to use it. Like, that's how it is right. Like all dudes think they fuck hard, right? All dudes are just like, "- Dude, I fuck hard". No, but for realsies, "- Like I fuck so hard." "- Hey dude, for real?" "- You don't even want to be around me when I start fucking." "- I fuck so hard!" "- I fuck hard. You know what I mean, like..." "- Brought a girl back to my place last night." "- Fucked her hard!." "Hey, how do you fuck?" "- Hard." You never ever hear a dude say, "- Fucked her medium." “- You know what I mean, gave her that medium dick." "- You know what I mean?" "- A little bit limp. You know how they like it!" "- To where you need a shoehorn to try to get it in." "- Keeps on... Trying to get it in." "- Keeps on smooshing up against your body." "- Pwaunk! Come on. Pwaunk! Pwaaaunk!" "- Come on. Pwaunk! Pwaunk!" Trying to get that ring pop. You know what I mean? All dudes think they fuck hard. Even dorks. Even like legit dorks. Like dorks that are just like... "- Uhm, excuse me..." "- Ah, excuse me, pardon me, oops, I am sorry." "- I'm so sorry, sir." Excuse me, I'm just trying to get to class." "- Ah, my calculator! You're kicking it!" "- It's a Texas Instrument! Please, somebody grab it!" Even that dude in his head is like, "- If they only knew". All dudes think they fuck hard. Except my buddy, he's the worst at having sex. I didn't fuck him. I know it sounds like that when I say it. I know he's the worst at having sex because he's been hanging out with this girl for a year. It's been a year. And he still hasn't had sex with her. A year! I know dude, he's my buddy. And I was like, "Yo dude, why have you not had sex with this girl?" And he says, "- You know what?" "- I don't even think I would, even at this moment in time," "- if I was given the opportunity." I was like, "Why not?" And this is what he said: "- Because I wouldn't want to ruin the friendship that we do have." Dude, 40 minutes later I got off the ground. I stopped laughing ok. I said: "Hey, yo." "You want to have sex with her ok." "You wanted to when you met her and you still want to now." "Why are you lying to you and me in the same sentence?" "Furthermore, why are you still hanging around this girl," "if she not giving you what you want?" That's like going to the supermarket and be like, "Hey, do you guys have contact solution?" And the store owner's like, "No, we don't carry that." and your like, "Oh ok, I'll hang just hang around here for a little bit and see what's up." Go to a different store, they might have contact solution You mark ass bitch! And let me break down some shit for you girls ok, while I'm talking about it. Here's the deal. If a guy's hanging out with you, he wants to sleep with you. That's it, period. That's what he wants. I'm sorry, but also, I'm not that sorry. That's what he wants. That's what it is. Any guy you ever hang out with, that's what he wanted. Right now there's a girl out there somewhere that saying, "- Well, yeah, but my one friend..." Aank! Him too. Him too. Him too. Right? That's what we wanted. That's what we wanted for hanging out with you. Right now, some of you girls are looking at the dudes that you came with. And your like, "- Wait a minute, really?" And some of you dudes are looking back like, "- Ha ha. No no no no no no." You're lying. You're a liar. I wish I was out there right and your looking at me, and the fucking comedian, saying what was saying right now. I'd already be looking at you like this. Because I'm not sorry. And there's no reason to apologize. That's what it is man. It's ok. And do you know what, how about this? Dudes want to sleep with all girls. All of them. All of them. That's what it is. All of them. All of them! All of them! You know what? More than all of them. I making up a girl right now in my head. She doesn't exist. "I want to fuck her!" All of them. All of them. Nine out of nine. All of them. You! You! You! Ehh. You! All of them. And do you know when I want to it? All of the time. All of the girls, all of the time. Not some of the girls, all of the time. Not all the girls, some of the time. All the girls, all the time. That is a lot of girls and times. Now, the problem is girls. They don't want to have sex with all the dudes all the time. Ahh fuck. But girls don't even want to have sex with some of the dudes all the time. Girls don't even want to have sex with some of the dudes some of the time. Girls want to have sex with like one or two dudes. Ehhh, sometimes. That's a huge problem in this world. It's half men and half women out there. The math doesn't add up. That's why there's a lot of dudes hanging around in supermarkets. "- Hope you have contact solution one day." You know. I used to get upset about it, you know, in like my "coming of age years". That girls don't want to have sex with as many dudes as dudes want to have sex with girls. But then I put it into perspective, I grew up a little bit. And now I totally feel you girls. I get it and I'm on your side and I understand. Because this is the truth. You let dudes inside of you. That's fucking insane man. Like, I would never let a dude inside of me, ever. I know dudes. They're not getting in this prize. I don't even want dudes inside my apartment, to be honest. But that's what it's like being a girl. There's always random dudes trying to break into your apartment. Only your apartment is in between your legs. No wonder why dudes think girls are crazy. No shit fellas. If I was a girl, I'd be the most crazy girl in history. For that reason alone. I would always be on guard just like, "No!" "No! No! Noooo!" "No! Back up! Back the fuck up. No!" "I see you in the bushes. Go! No! Shoo!" "Skedaddle! Get out of here! Scram!" I hear that, "Who's there?" I feel like that's why God put your vagina in this area. Because when in doubt, you could just sit on it. But dudes are still creepy, right? They'll just wait that shit out. "- She's gotta eat sometime, right?" "- Put a quesadilla down. Girls love quesadilla." "- When have you never not wanted a quesadilla?" Even if you just said... You'd just be saying, somebody's like, "- Do you want a quesadilla? " You'd be like "- Ya, I'm in, ok" All the girls, all the time. But the problem is, girls don't really want to have sex. I know when I say that, a lot of you girls are like, "Hey wait a minute buster, that's not true." "- Girls want to have sex, just as much as guys!” You think that, but that's so wrong. It's so wrong. I'm sure there's girls out there that disagree with me right now. Right? Where are you? That's a lot! That's a lot! That's a lot ok! Alright. Ok. You. I'll prove you wrong. Here's that. How about you. Right there, who yelled. Right there. Hi! All right. Whatever. You. I'll prove you wrong right now. How about this? Why don't you fuck that guy? You... Listen. You won't do it. But when I put it to him he goes like this, "- Which one?" It's ok that you don't like sex as much as us. But they like to wear it like... A lot of girls too, like you, would be very vocal about it. Like, you'd be on a date with a girl. She wants to prove she's down... She's just like, "- Oh my God, I'm not a sexual person." I really am. You'd be surprised. I love sex. "- Girls are...!" Then the dude would be like, "- Alright, well then let's do it." And then you'd be like, "Ah no, but wait!" "- We can't just do it!". "- I've been literally been running all day." "- We can't just do it!" "- I need to feel comfortable with you first!" "- We need to do a bunch of other things before we do that!" Why? What kind of sense does that make? Hey, check this out. If I want a bagel, guess what? I go get a bagel. I don't go skiing and then get a bagel. I want a bagel, fuck skiing. There's no bagels out there. But girls, that's how your minds work sometimes. "- But no, but sometimes you need to go skiing!" "- If you don't skiing every now and then," "- you'll never learn how to appreciate the bagel!" "- You can't just be eating bagels, whenever you so choose." Ya, you can! "- Stop it." "- Hey ya, stop it." "- You need to take me... Treat me like a human being!" "- Don't treat me like a piece of meat!" "- Come on, let's go do something. Come on!" "- Let's go out. Let's have fuuuun!" That's when every dude in our head were like this: "- Awe, fuck!" "- Alright, where do you want to goooo?" "- I don't know. What do you like?" "- I like fucking!" "- Stop it!" "- Take me somewhere. Let's do something." "- Let's get to know each other." "- Come on, let's go. Let's go out." "- Take me out on a date. Take me to a restaurant." We'll do it, we'll take you somewhere. That's why a lot of us are here right now. "- Take me to a restaurant." We'll do it, we'll take you to a restaurant. But we do not want to. We are pretending. And we're doing it for you! We're sitting there. "- No waaaay!" "- Num num num num num yuuum." "- Your friend said what? Get out of here!" "- Ah hahahahha!" "- Are you ready for some dick stuff?" "- No, stop it!" "- I'm not a slut." "- I don't just sleep around after the first date." "- You need to take me someplace else next time." "- Take me to the movies." "- Awe, fuck!" Now we're at the theater. "Two tickets so I can get some pussy, please." We think that that's how it works. "- Excuse me, that's not how it works." "- Alright, how many tickets do I need to buy?" "- The rest of them? Do all the tickets equal pussy?" "- No, stop it." Now we're at the theater pretending like we give a shit about what movie we're watching. We don't care. We're doing that for you too! "No waaay!" "- Look at everything that's happening for two and a half hours," "that has nothing to do with me fucking yooou!" "- Hey, how about that dick stuff?" "- No not yet." "- Come on, take me to someplace else.." "- Take me somewhere that we haven't been to yet." "- Like, take me to a museum." Am I trying to get laid or is this a scavenger hunt? What kind of crafty evil genius shit is this, if these girls have hash. Dating is some crafty, evil genius shit for a girl to be like. "- So, you'd like to gain access to this vagina, would you? "- You'd like to gain entry to this pussy. Would you not? "- Well in that case, you have to carry out three minor tasks." "- The first task being:" "- You have to take me to a restaurant that I want to go to." "- But you have to choose it!" "- The second task being:" "- You have to take me to a movie." "- But you have to guess which one I want to see!" "- It's going to be very difficult for real!" "- And the third and final task about the museum:" "- You see, I don't really like museums, I just know you don't either." And then after all that, you have sex with us. But then we don't want to, because we've been running around all day. I guess what I'm trying to say is. The moral of my set, or whatever. You know... Like, I don't know. You know like, some good comedians will have like, messages in their comedy? I don't, but... If I was going to, I guess mine would be: Be careful who you talk to online. Because people are really rude online. I'll post a video and then right away, somebody will comment under it something like: "- Fuck you, you're so ugly!" Or some shit. But I always write back because I have a lot of time. But the problem is, you never really know who your dealing with online. Like it could be anybody. They could be hiding behind their profile or computer. You get yourself into a lot of trouble that way. So be careful. Alright? This happened the other day. I posted a video. And then right away, somebody commented under my video: And they wrote, "- Hey, Chris D'Elia, you're not fucking funny at all." I was like, "Oh shit!" Alright, I got this shit. So I immediately wrote back under his comment: And I tagged him, so he got it in his notification center. And this is what I wrote... I'm not proud of it, but I definitely wrote this: I wrote: "Hey bro, I'll fuck your whole family." Whatever. I'm not sorry, he deserved it. But then right away this dude was waiting. And under my comment, he wrote another one and tagged me, so I got it. And this is what he wrote: "- Whatever Chris, 'Unfunny' D'Elia." And I was like, "Oh damn, this dude hit my 'hot button' ok". So, I took a different approach and under his last comment, I wrote another comment, tagged him so he got it. And I just shrugged it off, I wrote: "You know what? That's not even a good comeback." "Try again, you fucking 'Dick Writer' !" That's what I wrote. Then, this dude commented, under my comment. And this is what he wrote: "- I'm seven." Delete delete delete delete delete delete. I said, "Good thing I told him, 'I'd fuck his whole family' and left him out of the equation!" I had no idea this was a seven year old kid, I was dealing with, that's my whole point! Sure enough, I checked his profile. It was some seven year old kid, posting some seven year old kid videos. Just dancing around. "MMMMM". Eating cereal and shit. So under his most recent video, I commented: "Fuck you, you're so ugly." Thank you very much you guys. Thank you!
