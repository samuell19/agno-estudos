Hear the whistle? I think it's the bearings. Go ahead! - The water pump for sure. - Do you think so? It should be changed. Now where to find it? - It will not be an easy task. - We'll fix it. I know someone who can help. Guys! Do you think you're mechanics? - Why not? - If it's working it should not be changed. - I can't remain without a car. - I understand that! But I keep it. It's my idol! - If you think so... have a drink! - Let's go! It's the first occasion, how can I miss it...- Yes? When I threw it in the air along with a horse cart. I was 18 years. When it were? Very long time ago! Come on, sit down! - What's with that junk? - The water pump. - No, the bearings! - Work? - We know! Any resemblance to the reality of the film is not accidental. The action takes place in 1945, after the war, when Europe try to live again peacefully. It's here, bring the champagne quick! I'm on my way. He is Jo. An old friend. They dragged him to Mauthausen. Do you know Raymond? The technician. - Hello! - He's Manu. - Gallant. - How are you? And Lucien. We already know. You loss some weight. I wouldn't recognise you in the street I owe to my friends. We can't always choose them. You already said that. Right. If you not have anything against, Jo stays with us. It can only be good! As many wealthy people gathers, as many bastards as well! Let's go, Jo! I brought champagne. Cornelius, this is Jo. I'm going to see What about the steak. - Cheers! - No, guys! Do not say this ever! I met a judge, who told me while condemning me at 8 years of prison: This will help you, good luck! THE GANG Marinette! Marinette, it's me, Jo! Open quick! Has something happened? What did they do to you? - Dress up! - They didn't kill him, did they!? No! It was an accident. Last year I met Robert's gang. Who would have thought that this can happen? As the war ended, everyone has gone to Paris . Just like me! I found a job at the Tango bar and no matter how hard I tried not to let it to be seen I remained a little provincial. Good evening, gentlemen, do you want a table? - Yes. - Champagne! - Cognac! What's the asshole's name? Is OK? Don't do crap, Robert! Come on you ferret! I'll show you! No problem, just a small accident! Continue! Take care, you're about to get a licking! Thanks! - Are you afraid? - A little. - What's your name? - Marinette. Nothing special. Come now, I'll take you home! So it all begun . Robert wasn't the type to lose time... ...and did not give too many explanations... ...and I never needed them. We immediately went on a trip to the north. What time is it? Not too late. You know you're more beautiful without makeup? I have to do it for the clients. You know it. You're not going anymore. Where will I go? Wherever I go. Your parents are alive? Yes, in Aix En Provence. My father worked on the railways. Why? And what about now? No, he was fired. Political reasons. When someone does not have money, he should not to mix in politics. Your family how makes a living? I don't like to talk about me. I apologize for that! Take care! Pull the curtains, please! - Hello! - Hello! How's it going? - Good! Come in two days after me, at Felicia. Without makeup, Robert. Savings. Go ahead '! Come here! The safe deposit, fast! We haven't the key. Where's the key? At the accountant . And he's not here. Call him! No, leave it! Come! If you were tougher than that, he would've open it! Do not think about it! Hurry up, Jo awaits us in 5 minutes! Hands up! Nobody move! Where's the police when needed? It's reorganizing, lady. Come on, we're following you. Wrong way! I know. We're going back to the factory. Don't say any bullshit! I didn't like that bloody work. The policemen can go now at the bank. He have a small advance. Get off the overalls now. Police! Here, Inspector! The secretary fainted after they left. Police! Go inside, you can't stay here. Luckily we wasn't here. He's the accountant? - Yes! They tried to open it? I don't think it would be managed. It's so difficult to open? Yes, it's not easy at all. You need to know very well the lock. I understand. We're taking over. You come with us! If you do any move you're finished! The connection comes over 3 days. It's a beautiful sight to see so much money! What now? The police is investigating. All they can do is to applaud. Coz we'll gather more and more. Of course, it will always be the same. A 30 grand extra. If you agree, this is a gift for your child. No way! You can hire a nice nurse! All right then, thank you very much. Here, Jo. Each one with his cookies. Do you hear that? You want to see it? Of course. Let's see what you've sown. Don't worry, just be good! Come on! Forget about your uncle. You like the baby? I think he looks like you. Are you kidding? Just the next one! The little King of Pampas. Why the Pampas? I don't know if he'll be Argentine or Brazilian. Do you want to emigrate? Yes. I learn to just in case. He'll never know what I did. I left everything for Robert. The tango bar, the family, the friends and... the makeup. If he would have asked me to go after him at the end of the world I did it. Felicia's farm was not far. Feel like home! - Lady... - Call me Felicia. - Robert is here? - Yes, he's sleeping . He came home later. Do not bother him! - Are you an actress? - I was a singer once. I like you. I knew it would be like that. Robert It's not an easy one. Everything is normal and nothing is as it seems. The world is strange. It was always like that. Do you know him for a long time? When he was 13 he escaped from the penitentiary. He looked worse than a beaten dog. He was growling all the time. But when he smiled, I couldn't resist. I think you know that. Now I'm like a mother to him. But to have peace with one like him... You have to expect anything to happen. Watch him carefully! He was once called "the tough guy" or "the head". The enemies hated him, but also respected him. One night they caught him at the pool. They threw him from the third floor Look at him! Mute and paralyzed. Such people can end up just bad, unfortunately. Well? Come here! Come on, quickly! Press on the pedals! Beyond, faster! - Robert, wait for me! - Return to the left! Robert, your bike is faster than mine! Perhaps you are slower. Bring it here, come on! Come and get me! I don't know if there is greater happiness, But I earned some wonderful days with Robert. Days I only saw him. His dog, the trees, the sun and his laughter. All of these remembered me of those happy days. Take your hands off it I'll break your mouth, understand? So you'll never act like the cock! Do not touch it ever, motherfucker! Have you done? Yeah. He was rude to Janine. Calm down! This moron teased me. But you taught him a lesson! Only you didn't kill him. Go inside and shut up! Don't you think you've exaggerated? When you come to me, you must always break the glasses? Shut up! Too much love makes you crazy. Bring a bottle of white wine! And to knock at the door first, I know. Hello! Hello, Robert! - How are you? - What's this? - Nice, huh? - A jew gave it to me in '43. - And didn't he come after it? So far, not. And, besides, Don't you think it fits better here? The day they'll shoot you will be the only one you'll not steal. It will be the first occasion that we're not stealing anything. Who's there? - It's me, Janine. The white wine! Come in! - Put it here! - Did you read the papers? - It was a robbery at SOISSONS. - Who was? It says Robert's gang. If you meet them let them know that the policemen are really pissed off. Okay, go now! Please excuse me, gentlemen! I go have some fresh air. Lucien, what happens with the one that was thrown out? Would you like to finally finish? Lucien, Fuck it! We're not here cause of that guy. We got more important problems. Calm down! We came here to organize a robbery. One that will make all to lose the breath. Hello! Did I come too early? Yes. In fact, Mr. Despret used to come here for money. He's sick. I received no notification. Here's your notification! Hands up, is that clear? Back! Move! You too! Hold it like that! Here, it's ready. Thank you. What's that? Silence! Look! It can't be true! All right! Let's go gentlemen. Help! Behave, boys! If you don't want to die for the Rails. It's a robbery, help! How did it go? - Excellent. How it was planned. - Robert? - He comes after us. Attention! Each officer and policeman! Four gunmen committed a robbery. Two were dressed in policemen. Close and supervise every exit! Look, he's not afraid! He got guts! What's that? What's that? Look, mister supervisor! Attention all the officers and policemen! One bandit climbed on the roof of the station. Guard all exits! Faster! He's there, I recognize him! Quickly, it's that bandit! He's still there. Look he's descending! It's super, like an artist. Oh, how rude! Hey, how is it? OK. Where's the exit? 300 meters from here and it's open. Do you know who survived the war? Who? Rats. After '39 their number just doubled. It's the police! Please, I didn't do anything! Police, open up! Calm down, they don't want you! They're coming! Hide there! They're coming! I just can't work in peace these days... You're all fucked up! Get out, you have any documents? Yes. He don't seems to be arabic. You'll never know! The papers! He's a regular customer. After all, you started after the war to search for papers, documents, worse than the Gestapo. Have you finished? You name is Jean-Baptiste Barone. What are you doing here? I got it. You like the old chick isn't? But the rooster? Do you like it? Come on, we'll take him with us. And the papers? We need to check them. Are you in a hurry? For the troubles. I'll wait if you ask. Silence! Back to prison! A little nervous. Sir! I don't know why they brought me, I don't understand.

You, the one who talks french. What did you say? Say "yes, sir"! Yes, sir! Yes, sir. Let's go, buddy! I can't let you here with these guys. Hi, guys! Open! At the Railway offices was a robbery and the gang of Robert was blamed for it. Eyewitnesses claim that police believe that one of the bandits, Robert Plulcar, a.k.a. "Le dingue" (the Crazy) is the gang's head. The city authorities say they are ready to begin full investigations. Do you disown of Satan? Yes I do. In every situation? Anytime. In every action? Yes.

Janine, bring more champagne. It's finished I bring it now! Hurry! I never saw them like this. Look from distance. You'll not have this opportunity too often. If only would be always like now! Music! Do we play a ball? Is time for this? -Of course we have more than half of an hour left. Then, gentlemen, to the balls! Good idea! The women? They go to the kitchen. I wish this day never ends. Who would not like it? - My Little Tom Thumb! - Put him to bed a little! He was baptized and now have to rest, right? I wish a kid as well I'd bear easier the misery from the bar. If you only know what I hear there from morning to evening! Too much! Yes, it's true! Similar to what we use. You in the confessional, me at the bar. People would tell us their lives and we'd calm them down. But these wouldn't be disclosed. What? Don't take it so seriously! Today we are a bit troubled. What shit did you do? How can you start it like that? He could talk a little more civilized. You did it? How lucky. Wait a second! Can you push it? What did you say? I said now is been solved. Haven't you seen that? Come on! Big success! Go, go! Yes, he did it! What did he? Do you think that's enough? Let me show him now! Be careful! Look, look! You did it! Unbelievable, Robert! We have ten tips. We have 8, you haven't won yet. It's just a matter of time! I wanted to have children with Robert. But I didn't dare to tell him. I have to think about having a child in the future. But for Robert, there is no future. Yeh, directly in the middle. Very good! Yes, Manu, that's for you, take it! Did you hear? If only it could sing! Be careful, I know! I do not need it anymore. I left Léon alone, it's bad for him if I'm not there. - You know him. - Yes, wait! - You're leaving already? - Do you know this one? - I go with you, I had too much drink. - I go too! Give it to me! Your stupidity will betray you. Do you want to go to jail? Give it to me! If you want to know how it works, I'll show you. But I'd better give to you piano lessons. The pianists never end in the rope you fool! Go! Here, eat! It's Marcell and his friends, serve them! It isn't baptism every day! - Hello, lady! - Welcome. They're my friends. Glad to meet you, lady. I came for a lil' drink. Sit down! - How about a champagne? - Excellent! Today's an occasion. What? I had a baptism. - Five thousand. - Enough, I check your five and another five.

Three queens and two Jacks. - Goodbye! - Bye! - It was perfect. What's this? Help! Don't you go after the gun. I don't know what happened just that! Let's see! - Police! - Where? - They've surrounded us. Wait a minute! All the respect, sir! I hope your informants not fooled you. - All the gang is inside. Big deal. - All right. - Are they surrounded? - From all sides. - All right. They've acted directly. - As in '14. - All right, gentlemen. Did you see this? Don't go there, to the right! Hurry, hurry! Go in the kitchen! But who is it? This was not planned. It'll not be easy, gentlemen, they are tough guys. We'll catch them, it's just a matter of time. We could've catch them quietly. It was enough playing the guests. And he's hurt too. Ridiculous. I'm not involved I had few "black" cases. I don't want this to happen because of me. We should find a way to put you and the small one in safe. It would be a good occasion for them. You should come out too. You have nothing to do with it. I don't think they'll buy that. Robert should know too to avoid being captured. The phone is tracked for sure. Besides, I don't think that Robert is there anymore. I could say the baptism was "fixed". We'd better leave quickly. Are you kidding? The chief commissioner is speaking to you. You are surrounded. It's useless to oppose. Surrender! Come out with your hands raised, one by one. Now it's your chance to get out! Listen to the chief commissioner Now we can go, right? Stop a bit! I'm going to talk to him sir! My guests are inside including many women. A mother and her child. I'll let them out first. OK Mother with child first. Come out, one by one! Don't stop! - Come one! - We have done anything! - You'll tell us later! - Move! And now what? Really, what we'll do? So, you know Robert? Robert who? We came here to drink. We don't know anyone. Go and call the gendarmes. Say that you are the owner of the inn. And it was occupied by gangsters. Go with her Meet me at Felicia. Go! I come from Lyon. She's not bad! Hello, Miss! Can I use the phone? Sure, it's back there. How much can it be? Expensive! Down quickly! Spread out! Detective Moro! Look there! Something is moving down there. Right. Fuckers! They've called for help. Tell to the quarter that we were attacked from behind. Here is the quarter. What the hell is going on? What did you come back? To not let you alone. They're shooting like crazy. The police in the gendarmes. We'll scuttle away and meet at Felicia. And you? I'm staying. What to risk at my age? Bye, old man! Leave quickly, guys! What happened? A tragic mistake, sir! What? - The gendarmes just caught our men. Damn, I did not call the gendarmes! Who called them? A woman. Say no word to anyone. Are the papers here? They're starting to arrive! No turn them back! Send them away! What now, we'll attack? We can't attack before dawn. The chief commissioner is speaking. Pay attention to me! I'll order an attack. You still can surrender. You have no other choice. Let's avoid a massacre. For the last time, I ask you to be reasonable! Game's over. You are surrounded! Come out one by one. Hands on your head. Look how many people are here! Hello, gentlemen! I'm the owner of the inn. Come on, look everywhere. The kitchen and the basement too! Sir! You've got them? This one, yeah. And who is he? The inn owner, sir. Are you fucking with me? All night and two hundred men! To arrest the owner? You are a bunch of morons! Do you want me to believe you? Where are the others? Where are the others? To hell with you! The whole gang escaped... Not long time ago the police occupied an inn. First it was told that this was the black market headquarter of the the gang. In fact the police was looking for Robert's band. But when police entered the inn, it was already empty. The gang disappeared without a trace. And now... pop music. They didn't catch Robert, that's important he might be hurt Then it would be found. I go now. If you have news, you know where to find me. Open your eyes, there are cops everywhere. Death. Mine? Not yours, but for the reason you're here. Where are the others? They're sleeping. Where were you? I was so scared. Come! I always worried when I saw them together. Wherever they met, the old history began. Strong, frustrated men. And I? I felt that I didn't count. Take a look, damn it! I don't think we'll eat fried fish today it's not easy just seems easy. That's enough. Here, it's for you! From your wife? What's new? They released her She took the child and go to an old friend. Anything else? She says she can't bring the money now. The house is under stakeout better not go there. That is understandable. I didn't expect her to bring the money here. And what are we doing? Holding up the industrial bank. Are you kidding? How so? We just escaped from an ambush. Let's rest a bit! That's the problem What does this mean? Nobody will think that we were again involved surprise is very important. Remember the factory? It's over for me. No more . When my wife will recover the money it will be over for me. Do you mind? Of course not. On the other hand, you don't depend on me. Only by my godson. The documents you've requested, Mr. Director. The administration. What happened? Sir! Everything is here. Everything what? That. The safe. Please. Here. Surprise! Hello, Mr. Director! Come on guys! More enthusiasm! Have a nice trip! Miss, 16, please. 16? Yes, 16. But that's the police. I know, you'll tell it was a robbery. Robbery? Yes, a robbery. Wait two more minutes! I'll get something for Marinette. Give me a package before she find the serial number. Here. Look at that! The asshole wants to buy what he could easily steal. The stolen jewelries don't match. For you, Robert's another man. Hello, sir. Hello! Do you want something? A small gift. For a woman. I call my partner immediately. Hello, sir. How can I help you? I want a nice bracelet. It's a gift. All right. How expensive would it be? I want the most beautiful available. Here, a magnificent piece. It's 140.000 francs. That's even more beautiful. Indeed. 175.000. Today, such a jewel is an excellent investment. If you want something cheaper, we have some very beautiful. Under 100.000. Look! I like this very much. I have a crazy thought. I think I'll take them all. You'll take them all? Even if you don't pay them... What are you doing? What are you doing? Damn, old man! What's with you, are you crazy? He's ill. Faster! It's nothing serious, Marinette. I will survive. You know that I'm made of tough wood. Doctor, will he live? If you'll take him to hospital and he is operated on. There are hopes. No way! At least he'll die here, among friends, not under guillotine! What do you think? Why did you call me then? Let him rest! Where is Robert? Where is he? It's nothing to do now. He told me to give you this! Subtitles by: Vioamar@KG
