- I'm Monica Philips. I'm here in Richdale on Palomino Street not far from where Melissa Stark's body was found. We're here with Detective Morretti. Detective, does this appear to be a random attack? - We're questioning her family and friends and anyone she may have been contact with recently. It's too early to tell. - Some of the early reports say the body was found with letters and numbers carved into the body. - I really can't comment on the specifics of the case. - An officer I spoke with said he feels there will be more victims. - Again, no comment. - Does the department feel this is the work of a serial killer? - No comment. - Excuse me. One more question, detective, should the town of Richdale be concerned? - Hello. When? Okay, 20 minutes. - Talk to me. - I'd say the time of death was a few hours ago, maybe four. The female's cause of death is strangulation. By hand, judging from the marks on her neck. - How about the carvings? - Her assailant used a really sharp edge. Not a knife, a razor of some kind. - The same as the one used on Melissa? - I can't say for sure. Until I do a more thorough examination. From the looks of it, I would say yes. - What about the male? - Well, as you can see he was really badly beaten. But that's not the cause of death. See here? They literally beat this poor guy's brains out. From the depth and shape of the wound, I'd say they hit him with a lead pipe. Again, I can't be sure until I do a more thorough examination. - Okay, let me know as soon as possible. - Will do. - The man is Steven Jacobs. The female Danyelle Harmon. Both bodies had I.D. on them. - No prints, no witnesses, right? - Nothing. - Who discovered the bodies? - A patrol car was checking out the area ans spotted them. - Same markings as Melissa. The theory about the markings being the initials of the next victim is wrong. - Yeah. The carvings don't match with the victims. - I assumed that the victims were killed elsewhere and then dumped here. - Approximately four hours ago? Which would be around 3 AM. Patrol car spotted the bodies around 5:45 AM. They were dumped here between 3 AM and 5:45 AM. - I wanna know everything about the victims. Their families, their friends, where they were last seen. Then let's cross reference that with what we know about Melissa. See if anything matches up. - Got it. - I'll see you at the station. - Danyelle Harmon, 28 years old. Worked for City Tech. Software design company in the city. Steven Jacobs, 33 years old, worked there as well. He was her supervisor. - Okay, can I get a list of people they were close to? - Danyelle lived with her fiance. Kevin Cooper. - So she was cheating on her fiance with her boss? - Seems that way. - Where is Kevin? - Kevin is upstate on business. Has been since Friday. - Even though he has an alibi, I want him brought in for questioning as soon as possible. He's the first person involved that might have a motive. - I'll call over to the sheriff's office. Have him picked up and brought in. But that will be a few hours. - Anything on the family and friends of the victims? - I spoke to Danyelle's mother. She lives in Florida. She says her best friend is girl named Jessica Stewart. They've been friends since grammar school. - Okay, I wanna speak to Jessica first. See if she knew anything about Danyelle having an affair. If she thought that Kevin knew. You have an address on the friend? - Yeah. 125 Willowbrook Road. - Hey! The next time you go on TV and insinuate there's a fucking serial killer on the loose... - But Captain. - Was I speaking to you? - Captain, I didn't say anything about a serial killer. - You didn't have to. I saw the interview. I could tell by your responses. It's really fucking simple. Is there a serial killer on the loose? At this time we have no reason to believe there is. - But Captain, there is. - I don't give a shit. No one says serial killer until I say so, especially to the media. Now I got the press and the mayor breathing down my ass. No one speaks to the press about this case from this point forward. Understand? - I got it. - Yes, Captain. - So where are we? - The murders took place within a 24 hour period. Melissa's body was found early Sunday morning. Danyelle and Steven's early Monday. Both females were strangled and marked the same way and a note was left at both scenes. - Outside of the markings, we got nothing. No prints, no witnesses. All we got is a fiance with a possible motive. He was out of town while the murders were committed. - And these carvings? - We thought they were initials of possible victims. But they don't match up. - What about the fiance? - We're bringing him in for questioning. He should be here in a few hours. - I want to know the minute the fiance gets in here. Okay? Joey? I wanna see you in my office now. Shut the door. Sit. - Listen, Captain, I'm sorry about the reporter. - I'm over the reporter. This is about you. - What about me? - You look like shit. I need you to go home and get some sleep. - You're kidding, right? - No, I'm not kidding. - Captain, that's not possible. I have the fiance coming in and some of Danyelle's friends to question. - You've got nothing. The priority right now is the fiance who won't be here for a few hours. So you can go home and get some rest. - But there are... - Patricia will handle it. She will call you as soon as the fiance gets here. - Captain! - Goodbye, detective. - Detective. - No way. - Come on, three bodies in 24 hours? You've gotta give me something. - Thanks to your last interview, I'm not allowed to speak to the press. So if you want something, you have to speak to the captain. - Fuck. - Who's there? - Jessica? I'm Detective Morretti. It's very important I speak to you. I'm Detective Joey Morretti. I need to ask you a few questions regarding Danyelle Harmon. May I come in? - Yeah, sure. Is Danyelle okay? - Can we sit? - Yeah, sure. - I'm sorry, but Danyelle's body was found this morning. She was murdered. - What? Is this a joke? - I wish it was. I'm sorry, Jessica, but I need to ask you a few questions. Her body was found along side the body of Steven Atwater. Was Danyelle sleeping with him? I don't mean to be blunt, but I don't have much time. - Yeah she was. Danyelle loved Kevin, but she wasn't ready to marry him. - Did Kevin know? - I don't think so. Even if he did, he wouldn't do anything to hurt her. He adored her. Danyelle was my best friend, but I did not agree with the way she cheated on Kevin. - Other than Steven, was there anyone else recently? - Yeah, she mentioned some guy she met last weekend. But she didn't really say much about him. - Nothing? No description, no name? - She didn't really say anything except that he was a little older than her. - Did she mention where she met him? - Yeah. At Tambura Bar. - When did you last see Danyelle? - Last Sunday at Tambura. - Tambura? - Yeah, it's a place we go to often. - What time were you there? - We met up at 10 and we left around one, when Steven showed up. - We? - Yeah. - Who else was there? - Maria Miller. And Robin Jenkins. - I truly am sorry about your friend. If you need anything or you remember anything else, please feel free to call. I can help myself out. Thank you for your time. - Two more bodies. A serial killer. What's driving me crazy is the fact that the crime scenes were relatively clean. No prints. No DNA. Nothing. The carvings, I have no idea what the letters could possibly mean. But the numbers. Five, three, four, one, three, six. Seems very familiar. Five, three, four. One, three, six. Five, three, four. One, three, six. - Hi, this is Detective Morretti. Leave a message. - Joey, where are you? Kevin Cooper is here. He got here about 45 minutes ago. - Wait, where you going? - I'm going to take a piss, is that okay? - Yeah, just hurry up, I have to get home. - When did you talk to her? - I spoke to her Saturday morning and then again briefly that night. - Did you try to contact her at all after that? - I told her I'd be busy. I wasn't sure when I could call her again. - So your fiance, you talked to her twice on Saturday? - Yeah. I tried again Sunday afternoon, but I got her voicemail. So I left a message and I told her I'd call her back that night. - Did you? - No. I was exhausted. I went back to my hotel room and passed out. - You didn't try to call her again? - No. - Let me get this straight. You leave for business on Friday and you speak to your fiance twice, but you try to call her one other time. You talked to her twice in a three day period. - Yeah. We didn't have the type of relationship where we need to speak every day. Danyelle understood that I have a very demanding job. I understood that she had friends and a life. - Speaking of friends. Did you know Steven Jacobs? - Yeah. Steven was a close friend of Danyelle's. They went to college together. - Did you know they were having an affair? - No. I didn't. And you know what, I've been pretty fucking patient. I was dragged out of my hotel room and brought straight here. They tell me my fiance was murdered and I'm not allowed to speak to anybody but my attorney. I ain't answering another question until my lawyer gets here. - You okay? - I'm fine. Let me have a few minutes with him. - All right, but the captain wants to see you when you're done. - Hi, Kevin. I'm Detective Morretti. - I said I'm not answering any more questions until my lawyer gets here. - I understand. - Do you? Do you really? - Yes. - You dragged me in here, you tell me my fiance's been murdered and then you guys wanna question me like I killed the woman I love. Well fuck you, detective. I want my lawyer. - Listen. I know you didn't kill her. I'll be honest with you. We got nothing. I need your help. I got three bodies, a psycho on the loose. I need your help, Kevin. Help me catch this guy. Kevin. Please. - Okay. - Thank you. Did you or Danyelle know Melissa Stark? - The name doesn't sound familiar. She doesn't look familiar, but I can't say that Danyelle didn't know her for sure. - Did she mention coming into contact with any strange people or anything out of the ordinary? - Last week. She met some friends at the Tambura Bar. She said some guy was giving her the creeps. She didn't get into specifics. I didn't think much of it. Danyelle and her girlfriends are good looking women. Guys are always giving her the creeps. - So it happened regularly. And the fact that she mentioned it to you would make it more than normal, right? - Yeah, I guess. - Can you write down the names of the friends she was with that night? Thank you, Kevin. I'm sorry for your loss. - Sit. How you making out with the fiance? - Nothing solid. He told me about the bar she hung out in. It appears to be one of the last places she was before she was murdered. - Good. Send Patricia to the bar. - I have a few other people to question. A few of the friends that were with her. - Patricia will handle it. - What are you saying, Captain? - I'm taking you off the case. - What? - I am. I'm sorry, Joey. I need this guy caught. - Yeah, nobody wants to catch this guy more than me. - I know, but you look like shit. You look like you're falling apart. - I'm fine. - Joey, I'm sorry. You need a break. Patricia can handle it. - I'm just tired, I haven't slept much lately. - Yeah, I can see that. - Since the murder started, I've been having nightmares. - Nightmares? - Of the murders. - Well that's normal. This is a tough job. The things we see. The crimes are always on our minds. We go to sleep thinking about them. This is different. It's like I'm seeing them happen. It feels so real. Like I'm there. - Listen, take a few days off. Call Dr. Fitzgerald. - I don't need a doctor! I don't need a few days off! I need to catch this guy! - Joey, you're my best detective. - Another reason you can't take me off this case. Please, Captain. I need this. - Fine. Okay. But I'll be keeping an eye on you. Get your shit together and quickly. Otherwise, you're off this case. Got it? - Yes, Captain. - Good. Now get the fuck out of here! - What happened? - He was gonna take me off the case. - Take you off the case? - Yeah, but I talked him out of it. - I'll go to the bar. Why don't you stay here and try to figure out what the carvings are? - You sure? - I can handle it. I'll call you if I need you. - Sorry, we're not open yet. - That's okay. I'm not here for a drink. I'm Detective Stevens. I need to ask you a few questions. - Okay. - Are you the only bartender who works here? - No. Heather works during the week. I'm just covering for her. I only work the weekends. - Were you working this passed weekend? - Yes. What is this about? - Do you recognize this girl? - She looks familiar, but I don't know her name or anything. - How about her? - She was here last weekend. What was her name? Danyelle? - Yes. Do you remember who she was with? - She was with a few friends and then she left with a guy. I remember because they were one of the last to leave that night. - What time was that? - Sunday we close at 2 AM. - Was this the guy she left with? - Yes. - I'm gonna need the security footage from last week. - The owner keeps it locked in his office. - Is he here? He won't be back until tomorrow. His mother has been sick, so he's been spending a lot of time at her house in Wakefield. - I'll be back tomorrow. If you remember anything or if the owner comes back sooner, give me a call. - Sure. ♪ « They call me doctor ♪ « I admit I'm the cure ♪ « One dose is all you need ♪ « But you'll beg for more ♪ « I work my magic when your body's on fire ♪ « I'll break the fever ♪ « Of your burning desire ♪ « I'm gonna give it to you ♪ « I'm gonna give it to you ♪ « I'm gonna give it to you ♪ « I'm gonna give it to you ♪ « Just like a needle ♪ « I get under your skin ♪ « You start to lick your lips ♪ « And smile with a grin ♪ « The strong drug ♪ « Begins to take it's control ♪ « You'll be my slave ♪ « Because I'm stealing your soul ♪ « I'm gonna give it to you ♪ « I'm gonna give it to you ♪ « I'm gonna give it to you ♪« - What? - Jesus, Joe. - How'd it go yesterday? - I talked to two of the friends who were with Danyelle that night. They both say the same thing. They left the bar around 1 AM. Danyelle was still there. - What about the bar? - I questioned the bartender. She's not sure about Melissa, but she did say that Danyelle and Steven were at the bar. They were one of the last to leave that night. - Do you think that this bar is where our killer selects his victims? - It's the only possibility we have. I'm going back to the bar today to get the security footage. The owner was out of town yesterday. - Good. I'll take the remaining friends and you go to the bar. - Joey. I've been trying to stay out of it. But you look like hell. - Here we go. - I'm your partner. I'm concerned. - I'm fine! - I think maybe you should take some time off. - First the fucking captain and now you?! Maybe if we spent some more fucking time on catching this guy instead of worrying about me because it's my problem! I've been eating, sleeping and shitting this fucking case! So I'm sorry if I'm fucking tired! Sorry. I didn't mean to get mad at you. I'm sorry. - It's okay. But you're not the only one who wants to catch this guy. - I know. I'm sorry. Call me when you get the tapes. - Come in. Sit. - Joey's on his way to talk the last of the friends who were with Danyelle that night. I'm going back to the bar to get the security footage. - Good. Do you think these tapes will give us something? - I hope so. - What's wrong? - I'm a little worried about Joey. He's a good cop, but he seems to be having a tough time. - I'm concerned as well. We just gotta keep an eye on him. He's a good cop. One of my best. I was gonna take him off the case, but to be honest with you, I can't. Not until the killer's caught. Then I'll make him take some time off. So for the time being keep your eye on him. And call me the second you get those tapes. - Yes. - Hi, I'm Detective Joey Morretti. Are you Susan? - No, I'm Michelle, Susan's roommate. Is everything okay? - Yeah, I just need to ask her a few questions. - I haven't seen her since Sunday. - Since Sunday? - Yeah, we were at the Tambura Bar Sunday night. I stayed until about 12 AM and she was there with her boyfriend, Carl. I figured she was staying with him. - Does she stay there often? - Yeah. - Have you spoken to her? - Since Sunday? No, I tried to call the both of them yesterday but I got their voicemails. - Carl, where does he live? - 57 East Meadow. I think it's apartment 4-H. - Thank you. - Is she okay? - I'm sure she's fine. I just really need to speak to her. - Hi, this is Detective Morretti. Leave a message. - Joey, I got the tapes from the bar. There's a lot of footage. My apartment is on the way back to the station. I'm gonna stop home, change, clear my head and then go back to the station to look over the footage. I'll meet you there. Captain, I got the footage. What happened? - Patricia? Jesus. What happened? - I don't know. - Is he still in the house? - I don't know. - Stay here, okay? What the fuck happened? - I came home to take a quick bath. I heard a glass break in the kitchen. I went to see what it was. The next thing I knew, I woke up in the bed. - No, don't try to get up. This is Detective Joey Morretti. I need an ambulance at 7522 Chestnut Road. Officer needs medical assistance. You saw no one? - I told you, no. - How about when you woke up? Did you hear anyone in the apartment? - No. - He must have followed you from the bar. - The bar was empty. - If this is the place where he picks his victims, maybe he cases the place. He knew that you were a cop and he saw you come out with the tapes and then he followed you. - If that's so, why didn't he kill me? - I don't know, maybe he only kills who he selects. Where are the tapes? - On the dining room table. Where are they? - I put them right there. - Are you sure? - Yeah. It was the first thing I did. He must of taken them. - Shit. Okay, I gotta follow up on something and then I gotta go stakeout the bar. There are officers and an ambulance on the way. - I'll go with you. - No, you stay here. If I get anything I'll call you. - You feel it, don't you? - Feel what? - That you're missing something. - Yeah, but what? - You're a good cop. You'll figure it out. - But if I don't? - Then more people are going to die. - I can't let that happen. - Then you better get your head out of your ass and figure this shit out. - Hello? - Detective, we've located Carl Madison's car. It's in Willow's Point on American Cedar. - All right, I'm on my way right now. May I speak with the captain? - Hello? - Yes, Captain, I'm at Willow's Point. I think we have our suspect. I think Carl Madison is our man. - I don't wanna hear "think." - I found box cutters and rubber gloves in his car. His girlfriend's roommate hasn't seen them since they left Tambura Bar Sunday night. There's blood all over the box cutters and gloves. - Okay, I'm sending a team to collect the evidence. I need you back at the station. - This doesn't seem strange to you? I mean a killer who leaves no trace of himself at any of the crime scenes does something this sloppy? - We'll see if the blood on the blade matches any of the victims. - It will. - Maybe it won't. Because it's not him. - Who are you talking to? - Myself. - Okay. The traces on the blade match Danyelle and Steven's blood along with Melissa and another unknown female. - Could be Susan's. Let's go see the captain. - Come in. Tell me we got our guy. - The traces on the blade match the victims. - Good. Let's get this guy picked up so this nightmare can end. - I'm afraid it's not that easy, Captain. - Meaning? - It doesn't make any sense. I can't see the killer ditching his car with the evidence. - Yeah? Well he did. - This guy is too smart for that. All the victims, all the crime scenes, not one mistake. - I want all the attention put on bringing in Carl Madison. - But the girlfriend still hasn't been found. - Do you have any leads on her whereabouts? Or any other suspects? - No. - Patricia? - No. - Find Carl Madison and bring him in. End of discussion. Now go. - If the captain asks, I'm following a lead on a possible location of Carl Madison. - Why? Where you going? - To try and find Susan. Or another suspect. - But Joey! - Just please do that for me. I'll call you as soon as I can. - Detective, is it true there's a possible suspect? - I told you, I'm not allowed to comment. - Please, detective. Off the record. - Get in. We may have the identity of the killer. - May? You're not convinced? - No. The killer selects his victims at the Tambura Bar in Margetville. All the victims were there the night of the murders. Two people are missing. Susan Philips and Carl Madison were last seen Sunday night at the bar. We found Carl's van and inside was a murder weapon. - So what makes you think he's not the killer? - The killer never leaves a trace of himself behind. Now, all of a sudden, he ditches his van with the murder weapon in it? It doesn't make any sense. - Why are you telling me this? - Not sure. - Thank you, detective. - You didn't get any of this from me. - Of course. - Hello? - This is such a waste of time. - I have no other lead. - You don't think Carl's a killer and it's Friday. - And? - Well Carl is not the killer and the killer likes to choose his victims on the weekend, then we stakeout the bar. - Okay. - Good. Let's get out of here. - I can't just sit around and wait? - Fine, you wanna waste your time here, go ahead. I'm leaving. - "You can find Susan. "You can find Carl. "The location is exactly where you think it is." - Hi, this is Detective Morretti. Leave a message. - Joey, call me back right away. - What're you doing here? - I'm meeting someone. - Who? - Two weeks ago I wrote the story about Marcus Johnson. - Marcus Johnson, the business man slash drug dealer? - I got a letter from someone saying they had some information for me. - Maybe you shouldn't be here? - Why? Are you expecting the killer to show up? - I don't know. - You're still not convinced it's Carl. - No. And even if it is, we still haven't found him. - I'll be okay. Besides, this is my lucky day. Information on Marcus and the possibility of the killer showing up. - He does seem to choose pretty women. You probably would be right up his alley. - I'll take that as a compliment. I'll be okay. I appreciate the concern though. Besides, you're here. - Not for long. I have something to follow up on. - Well, be careful out there, detective. - You too. - What are we missing? There must be something. Wait a minute. Why're the carvings on victims in sets of three and the letter only has eight? - Yeah, I'm home now. He never showed up. I know. All right, baby, I'm gonna go to bed, okay? All right, bye. - Hi, this is Detective Morretti. Hi, this is Detective Morretti. - Hello? - Patricia. - Where the fuck have you been? - I've been following the lead on Carl. My phone was dead. - I think I know what the carvings are. I think they spell my name. Joey? - Are you sure about that? - I think so. - Okay, listen, I'm heading to my place right now. Meet me there. - Okay. - You can find Susan. You can find Carl. Their location is exactly where you think it is. - What? - You just have to step aside and look. - What are you talking about? - We better get home before she does. - Why? - Well, she gets there before and starts to snoop around she might figure out that you're the killer. So come on, let's go. - I'm not the killer. - Just step aside and look. - What does that mean? - It means... One your eyes. Take a good look. - See what? - Get out of the way. You'll see it. Open your eyes. - No fucking way. That's not possible. This is impossible. I'm a cop. I'm a good fucking cop! - Yeah and a good killer. Do you see it now? - I'm tired. I'm stressed. This isn't real. - It is real. - Fuck you! It's not real! - What about Monica? All this time wasted. She's definitely at your place by now. You're gonna have to kill her. - I didn't kill anyone. I'm not the killer. I just need some rest. This is real. You killed them all. I'm not the fucking killer! Yes you are! Fuck you! Fuck you! - Joey? - Hi, this is Detective Morretti. Leave a message. - Joey, I'm in your apartment. Where are you? - The carvings, I have no idea what they could possibly mean. But the numbers. Five, three, four, one, three, six. It seems very familiar. Five, three, four. One, three, six. Five, three, four. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. You startled me. - What were you doing in my bedroom? - I was looking for you. The door was open. Thought you might be in the bedroom. - You want a drink or something? - Yeah. Sounds good. How come you never told me about the letter? - What letter? - "That location is exactly where you think it is." Joe? Did you need to tell me anything? Joey? Joey, please. Talk to me. - She knows. I told you if she came she would find out. - Find out what, Joey? - Do you think I'm a good cop? - Joey, let's go down to the station and talk about this. - How do you figure what the crimes mean? - I don't know. I guess I just stepped aside and looked. - Patricia, I'm really confused. - I'll help you. Why don't we go down to the station and try to figure this out? - I'm not going anywhere! - Joey. Please. - This is getting fucking ridiculous. Just killer her! - Joey, put down the gun! - I'm not gonna kill her. You have to! Joey, put down the fucking gun. - Patricia, I'm your partner. I could never hurt you. - Then you don't need a gun. Now put it down. - Just kill the bitch already! No! I'm a cop! I'm a good cop! You fucking shot me! - Lie on your stomach. Get on the floor! - I can't believe you shot me. - I'll do it again if I have to. Now get on the fucking floor. - Okay. Okay. - Hands on your head! Hands on your head! - I told you I wasn't afraid so you fucking shot me! I told you I didn't kill anybody and you want to arrest me? Kill her! - Joey! Joey, wait! Please, let me help you! - You'll arrest me for something that I didn't do. You did do it. Shut up! Shut up! - Joey. You're my partner and I love you. Please. Don't make me kill you. - This past week has been a blur. I don't know what happened. Or who I am anymore. - You're my partner. And you're one of the best cops I know. Please, let me help you. - I'm not the same person anymore. - You are. You just need some help. - I was a good cop. - You still are. - All I ever wanted to be was to be a cop. - Joey, no! - Come in. Sit. They found Monica Philips' body in her apartment. She had been rapped and strangled to death. Joey's prints and DNA were all over the place. Did he ever make mention as to why he committed these murders? - He had no idea he did. - There's still no sign of Carl or Susan. We're assuming they were victims. But there's no idea to where their bodies may be. - He never said. - I want you to take a couple of months off. With pay. Take vacation. Take your time coming back. - Vacation? - A few months to clear your head. - With all due respect, Captain, I don't think this is something I can ever clear from my head. - Listen, I know it's a tough thing to swallow. Somebody close to you, a cop, a good cop, turns out to be a killer. - What bothers me the most... Is that he was my partner. My closest friend. And I can't stop thinking that maybe if I had paid more attention, been a better detective, maybe I would have noticed. - You can't blame yourself or feel guilty for what happened. Being a police officer isn't an easy job. But don't throw your career away. It'll pass. Sometimes people just lose it. - I got nothing left. - What will you do? - I gotta get out of here. - And go where? - I guess I'll get in my car and drive until I feel like stopping. I guess that's the way. - I'm gonna hold on to these for you. - So long, Captain. ♪ « I'm trying to think ♪ « What my life would be ♪ « If there wasn't any you ♪ « Would there be any me ♪ « I felt your hands ♪ « Your such a man ♪ « Everything's so intriguing ♪ « But with such feeling ♪ « Unfold me ♪ « Yeah, yeah ♪ « We're facing a fatality ♪ « Every time we're in love ♪ « It's easier for me to breathe ♪ « Unfold me ♪ « Yeah, yeah ♪ « I know where you came from ♪ « The life that could've been ♪ « Left so young ♪ « Because of you I've chosen ♪ « To choose a life that is more worthy ♪ « Is more worthy ♪ « Unfold me ♪ « Yeah, yeah ♪ « We're facing a fatality ♪ « Every time you're in love a lot ♪ « It's easier for me to breathe ♪ « Every time you're in love a lot ♪ « It's easier for me to breathe ♪ « Unfold me ♪ « Where ♪« Is ♪ « This ♪ « Needed ♪«
