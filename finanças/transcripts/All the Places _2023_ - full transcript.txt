He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness. - For thou art with me. - [footsteps approaching] Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me and guide me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. It's my father's funeral, come on. And I'm already late. Sir, no, I've never broken the law. For my father's soul, may God have him in His Glory, help me out. Okay, hold on a second. I know a trick, so wait and let's see if it works. [inhales deeply] [playful music] Well, look at you. Lucky man. Either it already passed, or doesn't run today. - Awesome! - Yeah. - Let's go! - Let's go. [church bell tolling] [train whistling loudly] I'm sorry, boss. The train does run today. MÓNICA ZAVALA DE ANDA JUNE 1995 Uh... Well, um... [gentle music playing] My dad used to say that, um... that funerals are very dull. And boring as hell. And I don't know why he decided I should... give a speech at his. But when... when he got obsessed with an idea, well... [chuckles] ...there was no way of getting out. And well, here I am in front of you. [voice breaking] I mean, in spite of it all, he... He was a... [suitcase wheels rolling] - Fucking asshole. - [crowd gasps] You can't even make it to your dad's funeral on time? This is Mexico! It wasn't my fault that a train passed by...

What are you doing? I'm just tightening the wiring. ALL THE PLACES Okay. Why didn't you put Dad's ashes in a small planter and next weekend we could just plant it together? Please get out. Okay. [grunts] [car door closes] [sighs softly] [gentle music playing] [car stops] [car door opens] [slams door] - Were you able to say goodbye? - [sighs] [unlocks gate] [gentle music continues] [exhales] [keys jangling] [gentle music rising] [Fernando] Gabo! This is a fucking museum! Of San Miguel's middle class, like, during the 80s, am I right? Make a business out of it. Sell tickets, dude! [gently melodic music playing] [sighs] [Fernando] Mm. [gentle music continues] [click] [exhales] [chuckles softly] [door slams shut] Gabo! [footsteps approaching] Oh, my God! Is this the same old fridge? You should've replaced it. You left the front door open. So what? [scoffs] [fridge rattling] - [Fernando grunts] - [phone chimes] [whirring] - [loud clack] - Oh, fuck! No fuckin' way! This is so cool, dude. [inhales deeply] [chuckles] - The lamps are super cool, too. - [clears throat] I'm really impressed. Do you still sell those? Are you giving me the cold shoulder? It wasn't my fault, please. The flight got delayed. Airports in Mexico are a piece of shit. In Singapore, if you don't leave on time, they shoot the pilot, huh? [sighs deeply] "No, bro, don't worry about it." "What matters is that you're here." "Can I get you a beer?" "Oh yeah, sis, that'd be nice!" - Cheers. - When are you leaving? First thing tomorrow. So cut it out. Let's make peace for one night. Tomorrow you can be angry at me again. Deal? - Come on, Gabo. - [scoffs] I hate it when you call me "Gabo." [exhales] By the way, I didn't see Beto at the funeral. He didn't go. - Mm? - But he sent flowers. What about that toaster I sent you? I never got a thank you and it was a good one. Yeah. It lasted a long time, even more than our relationship. But I couldn't depend on it. It reminded me of you whenever it failed. [Fernando] Fucking Beto. He actually cheated on you with Alicia Plancarte. Piece of shit. Sure. - And you? - What? How many women have you cheated on lately? How could I? I don't have time. I live at the office. I didn't even realize my apartment had a balcony for a whole month. - [clicks tongue] Don't be a moron. - [laughs] I really mean it! I'm snowed in at work. We have this super important client, and well... They insist that I have to go back, but... [gulps] And you? Do you still have the shop? Why ask? You already know I do. Come on, dude! Maybe you're doing something different. How should I know? [bittersweet music plays] [breathes heavily] [swallows] I bet it's been rough, hasn't it? At the end was very painful.

What? - [laughs] - It's just a symbolic act. Come on, dude! - [laughs] - I mentioned Veracruz because it's way closer, but you, man... Hey, Acapulco is nice too. Oh, just because of Luis Miguel. Well yeah, just because of Luismi's videos and because... I don't know, all the telenovelas took place there, right? [both chuckle] - [Gabo] Mm. Look at that. - [Fernando] Oh, wow... - [Gabo] Aww... - Man, when did we make this, Gabo? [dramatic music playing] It was before mom's death. Hmm. [Gabo] Mm-hmm. It looks pretty pro, right? Hmm. Of course, I made it. - Yeah, right? - [chuckles] "Rule number three." "During the adventure, participants will be obligated to take turns doing whatever the other wants." - "No exceptions." - Mm-hmm. "The first turn will correspond to the younger participant of this contract." - [whistles] - Yeah, you totally wrote that. - [chuckles] - [sucks teeth] Ooh.

No, no, dude. - This is where the adventure begins. - Oh, you don't say, bro. - Right now, you and me, Acapulco! - [laughs] - You're super drunk. - Well yeah, but my idea is so good! Uh, no! You're leaving tomorrow, Fernando. I have plans and things to do. - It's not possible. - Gabo! - We made a promise over 20 years ago. - [sighs] Exactly, brother. You disappeared 15 years ago! You can't just show up and wreak havoc, tsk-tsk. Gimme a reason. I can't remember if I turn the lights off. No. Gabo, seriously. Why do you need to stay here? - [starting engines] - Acapulco! - [laughs] - Yeah! [Fernando] Let's go! Acapulco! Whoo! [Gabo] Woo-hoo! [rock & roll music playing] [gasps] Fuck!

No, no, no. I have to watch what I eat. - What? - Oh, please... My stomach is not used to eating much. Says the guy who used to have chips and hot sauce for dinner Yeah, but I was young then. Now in Singapore, my breakfast consists of rice and fish, okay? - Oh, really? - What? Singapore ranks eighth overall of healthiest foods in the world. And what's your point? You're like me, we can eat whatever we want and we don't get fat. I need to do two hours of cardio daily. Wait, tell me how you eat so much without getting fat. I'm like a lobster. - Everything I eat goes to my fanny. - [chuckles] [chuckles] But honestly, it's a lot easier for guys. After 35, we women just get soft and flabby. - Oh, Gabo, come on. - Kids are my warning. They now call me "lady." I don't even get called "miss", even by accident. [laughs] - Can't believe it. Such a drama queen. - Mm. - [phone vibrates] - Oh, just a minute. Wait, wait, wait. Hello. Sorry I didn't call. No, please, don't be upset. Yes, yes, I know this is important but my father just died. Well, just tell him to fucking wait! Sorry. Yes. Okay, just give me some time to adjust before I travel. Hello? Hello? Well go fuck yourselves! I'm sorry. [playful music] [phone clatters] - [sighs] - Are you okay? Oh, a client's nervous and these morons can't wait for me. Mmm. Just finish your gorilla breakfast and let's go back to San Miguel. Come again? What? And the adventure? Gabriela. I... I can't go on vacation whenever the fuck I want. I'm needed. Don't forget you said we should do this. Yeah, because I was hammered and I felt nostalgic. Gabo... Gabo, I swear we'll do the trip together some other time. Okay? Sure. In 15 years? Gabriela, don't be like that. We don't have clothes. I didn't bring my vitamins, seriously... [scoffs] Okay, then I'll go alone. Yup. - Gabo... - If I don't do it now, I'll never do it. No. Come on, Gabo... Gabo. Please, wait. Don't do this. ["Moarphine" by Rafael Ángel Pérez Valcárcel playing] [blows] Gabriela! - Gabriela, wait a minute. - Ugh... - You can't go alone. - Oh, really? No! Like you said, I don't have anything to do in San Miguel. You alone on the highway is very dangerous. Oh Fer, come on! - What...? - Tsk. Tsk... I knew you would chicken out. - It was obvious. - No, wait. I knew it. Dad had the perfect phrase, "If the coffee lacks color it's clear." What's the meaning of that?

Yeah, horribly, and I have more cushioning than you. [chuckles] - I've got a rash going. - That's good! First you get a rash, then you get a blister. and finally a callus. - That sounds nice. - [car stops] So, where to next? [man] Why did you mess everything up? I told you to pee before leaving the house so we wouldn't have to stop. - I didn't have to go back then. - But you do now. - Should've gone then. Hurry. - Relax, babe. - We won't get a ribbon for being earlier. - No, that's not the point, Marisol. The problem is the lack of responsibility in those kids! Goddammit! - But they're only 11, come on. - Hey! - You take too long, we'll leave! - [Marisol] Ugh. - [Fernando] Sounds just like Dad. - [man] Is she even in the restroom? [Marisol] Just ask her for a receipt. Ready, Gabo? Where do you wanna go? I don't know. I feel like going to the Tequisquiapan Fair. Fair? Out of all the options you choose a fair? It's a cheese and wine fair. Okay, you got me at wine. That changes everything. Yeah, I've always wanted to go, but I've never planned it. How come? Mm. Dunno. I guess the lack of time. - Well let's do it. - Alright. Lemme check Waze first. What? Waze? No. Come on, that didn't exist when we were kids. And plus it's not part of the rules, you know? Listen, we'll just take a right here. Come on. - Fine. - Ready? Yep. [gentle music plays] - [Fernando sighs] - [clears throat] Wow. I can't believe how cool the fair was. Use Waze. Just in case. [sighs] [church bell tolling] [Gabo] Check this out. What is it? - I've got us everything. - [exhales] Well? - Nice cleaning kit. - Mm, very good. It's got everything. Two Tequis' sweatshirts for the cold. Ha-ha! I bought T-shirts, too. - Are we really wearing that? - Mm-hmm! They didn't have anything nicer? Well, I asked if they had the new arrivals from the fall-winter Gucci collection, but they ran out. - Mm, damn. What a scam. - And we should take care of the cash. None of these stores take debit or credit cards. - You serious? - Mm-hmm. - Hi there. - Hello. - I'd like a bottle, please. - Sure. - Thank you. How much? - $15. Fifteen... - Oh, no... - Oh, hey. Ugh, I thought I had cash. Do you take cards? No, I'm sorry, we only take cash. - Uh, hello. - Hi. - Sorry, I was sure I had some cash... - Yeah, don't worry. ...but, well... Don't worry about it. I can... get it for you. if you want to. Mm-hmm. - [chuckling] No! No, that's crazy. - [Gabo laughs] No, no, thanks, but no. - You don't need to... - Relax, these things happen, right? Mm-hmm. - Well, I'll take three, please. - Aah! - No, just kidding! Ha! - [laughs] It's just weird, I feel a little bad. I know it's weird but it's fine, it's... my brother's money. Oh! The bank of Singapore pays. - A bank? - Yeah. - Amazing when a bank pays once in a while. - Exactly, yeah. Think of it as a rebellious act of the working class. - [man] You're right! - Mm-hmm. [man] That's great. I know. Thanks, to you. Thanks. And the bank of... - Of Singapore. - Of Singapore. - Mm-hmm. - Exactly. My pleasure, sir - Mm? - The miss got it, thanks. Yes. Okay. - See you around. Thank you. - Mm-bye. [giggles] [smack lips] So, how much was it? ["Qué Bonito" by Primo Son playing] [Gabo sighs] I brought you this. What? Are they still angry? Nah. They haven't written. They must think I'm on a plane. Aren't you gonna call them? And say what? That I'm here enjoying cheese and wine with my sister? [Fernando chuckles] What are you doing? [laughter] Turn around, Fernando. - Who's that? Do you know the guy? - No! Stop staring! - You're super obvious. Just stop staring. - But why are you looking at him? Do you like him? Well he's really handsome. Please stop staring! Gosh, you're so obvious, Fernando! Who is she with? - I know about this stuff. - You're the worst, Fernando I think he likes you. Yeah, right, come on. The last one I flirted with was Beto. At Marianita Villarreal's quinceañera. [scoffs] Are you serious? Mm-hmm. You've been with other guys besides Beto, right? [sighs] I'm sorry but I'm not... I'm not answering that question. I'm worried about you! You've been divorced for two years! Three?! - Three years without... anything at all? - You know how San Miguel is, Fernando. You smile at someone and next day you're in the paper. You better not screw whoever you meet on the street. - Listen, let's talk to him. - No! What's your problem? - I'd be too obvious! No, please don't! - This is my turn. - We're gonna do whatever I say. - You can't try that on me now. The rules are clear. And we have to respect them. Or what are we? Wait, please... Ay, ay, ay... Move it! Oh... Hurry! - Hello there. - [man] Hey, hi! Sorry to interrupt but, my sister and I aren't from around here. We're looking for dinner recommendations. Oh, you are brother and sister. [both chuckling] Well, you know, my cousin was wondering. - Cousin! - Oh... [man] That's right. Yeah. Take a seat - We don't mean to bother. - Oh, no! Not at all! I mean, I can sit in this chair and you can use that one. - Really? - The person who paid for this bottle, - was you. - [chuckles] - And the bank of Singapore, right? - Yeah! - No big deal. Thank you. [chuckles] - Wow! - No big deal. - [man] Really? Well my sister would have bought another bottle but, we're watching the cash, right Gabo? - Yeah, you're right. - Gabo? - No, Gabriela. - Gabriela.

My sister is great at collecting things nobody wants. I mean, she's good at inventing cool things. As a kid she won contests! Uh-huh. You used to help me. Remember the last one? - Yeah. - Oh, no! I didn't do much. - [Gabo] You did! - I love that you get along so well Yeah. We were a dream team. As kids we were ping-pong champions. - Can you believe that? - Oh, wow! Tap dance second place, too. - [laughter] - Wha... What? [Gabo] What? - Oh, the... the... the dance? Tap? - [Fernando] Yeah! Tap dancing is surprisingly popular in San Miguel. - You're just kidding, right? - [Fernando] No, we're not! - It's the truth. - [Fernando] I swear! It's weird, isn't it? - Gabo, let's show'em! - [Gabo] No! - God! Fer, wait! - [Fernando] Comin' through. - [Gabo] I don't remember the steps. - You do! We practiced that thing every day for two fucking years. [Gabo] I don't! - Are we using this to dance? - [Fernando] Yeah! - You really tap with those? - Alright, I'll do it! If we put it in here... - Can you help me? - [Fernando] And what it does... You'll see me fly on the stage. - My God, can't wait to see that. [laughs] - Try not to faint, alright?

[Lalo moans] Hey, not to be a prude but, if we're going to do kinky things... I don't know, maybe you could tell me where... - [Lalo moans] - ...to put it? Lie down. [breathes heavily] Don't you wanna disinfect it first? - Sa! - Oh. Oh! [breathes shakily] [moans] [breathes shakily] Oh! Do you feel... all those vibrations? Oh, it's a battery powered one! Mm... [moans] Do you feel it? [breathes shakily] I don't know, maybe I'm just having a delayed reaction, but I'm gonna try and focus on it and I'll make it work. Sa! [chuckles] Fer, we're not going to do anything. But why not? [chuckles] No, I think I... should go to my room. No... No, please wait. It gets better. [tense music playing] What? Mm... [chuckles nervously] I'm sorry but I just wanted to scratch the itch of curiosity. [door opens] - [sighs] - [door closes] Contain the orgasm. [breathes shakily] [moans] - Just hold on. [moans] - Sure, sure I can. Sa! - [hisses] - I can contain it, don't worry about it. I'll keep it locked up. [Lalo moans] Ah, that's pretty. Sa! [moans] [breathes shakily] [moans] [breathes heavily] [chuckles] Did you like it? [Lalo breathes heavily] [hisses] Finished? [in Spanish] ♪ Everything's so gloomy without you ♪ ♪ The seas wash away from the beaches ♪ [turns turntable off] How'd everything go? [grunts] What a night. Is that so? Why did you... - [Fernando] Hm? - ...turn it off? I don't like José José. You were singing that. Was I? Nah. That one was Dad's favorite song. [Fernando] Really? - I don't remember. - [exhales] He played it almost every day. He sang it when he took a shower. Mm. In the end, he was a better person. I promise. The cancer made him more relaxed. At some point he even was funny. Oh, man! I remember one day with poor Aunt Enriqueta. She said, "Francisco, don't be afraid. You're going to a better place." And you know what he said? "Anywhere is better than by your side, Enriqueta." - [chuckles] - [Gabo laughs] [sighs] [gentle music playing] It's fine if you wanna be sad 'cause he passed away. Mm. Dad asked about you all the time, Fernando. - He was super proud of you. - Come on, proud? Yeah, sure. [sniffles] I know he was a difficult guy, but he loved us in his own way. He couldn't handle Mom's passing. He didn't know how to raise us, and you can't teach an old dog new tricks. That's perfectly normal, man. I... [chuckles] At first I despised his lectures but now I miss them, you know? I never understood why you didn't leave San Miguel. Because I couldn't leave him alone. No. Before Dad got sick, I mean. Exactly. [Lalo] It's recharged! Hey, are you ready? [chuckles] Already? - [Fernando] Have fun... - Mm. [chuckles] - It's gonna be incredible. - [Gabo] Oh, really? - [Lalo] Yeah, you'll see. - [Gabo] Is it my turn? [Lalo] Yeah. [door closes] - [moans] - [Gabo chuckles] Man, I loved every moment of it. - [Gabo chuckles] - That was the best night of our lives. - [chuckles] Sa! - [Gabo chuckles] [Lalo exhales] - [chuckles] - Sa! - Thanks for having us. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [hisses] - Well, see ya. - Thanks for everything. - Thank you, cuz. - Our pleasure. - We had an amazing time. - Take care, guys! - Come back soon. - Of course. Yeah. - [chuckles] - You good? - Super good. And you? - Good. - Ready? - Let's hit the road. - Let's roll. - Yeah. [engines rumbling] [uplifting music playing] [Fernando moans] Done? [Fernando, sighing] Yeah. - I'm super tired. - [chuckles] [uplifting music continues] [Fernando] Not even a message? Seriously? What if something bad happened? First they want me to come back and now they don't care about me anymore? - [exhales] - [sighs] Was last night really fun? It was an experience that... I definitely believe it's not gonna happen again. In my life. Yeah. I noticed the cuz had big hands. And a lot of energy. Stop that. I'm you brother, I don't need details. No, not at all. And how was your night, brother? - Fine. - Mm-hmm. She was into it but, well... She wasn't my type. She didn't have big... hands? - Not exactly. - [Gabo laughs heartily] [water running] [uplifting music playing] No. Hey! Let's stop there. But why? Please, do it! Fer, what's wrong? I think we should turn around and pick them up. This isn't Singapore. You can't pick up hitchhikers. It's very dangerous. Uh-huh. Do they really look like criminals to you? Gabo, they're super young trying to get a ride on the highway. What if something happens? - [boy] Here they come. - [girl] Oh. Do you think it's safe to go? - Yeah. - You sure? Easy. They look nice. Relax. [exhales] - [girl] Hello. - [boy] Thank you. Hiya. Where are you headed? Just to meet up with some friends in Tlaxcala. - Oh! We can take you both. - [Gabo] Oh! But Tlaxcala's out of the way, isn't it? - You wanted the hot springs. - You loved them? Yeah, but now it's my turn. So deal with it. [indistinct whispering] Of course we can take you. - Are you sure? - Yeah, yeah. - Of course. - [girl] Yeah? - Okay! Thanks a lot! - Thank you. I'm sorry but, could we just see your IDs? - Oh. Sure, sure. - Oh, wow. - [girl] Thanks. - Yeah. Sorry, one can never be too safe. - Totally fine. - That's good. - Yeah. - [Gabo] Good that you... We're just gonna take a picture and send it to our friends. Exactly. And a selfie, okay? - Oh, for the memories. Sure. [chuckles] - [boy] Yeah. [playful music] - [hippie] How are you? - [woman] Little brothers, how are you? - Hey, how are you guys? - Brother! - [girl 2] You made it! - These kind people gave us a ride. Hey Fer, over there. Welcome to the world of the fireflies' community. How are you? Oh, may I touch her? Hello. Welcome, sister. - Yeah. - Hi, sweetie. - [chuckles] - What's up with the goat? - It's a symbol for the community. - Oh, so you're not gonna eat it. - [girl] No, of course not. - Hi there. [mystic music playing] [Gabo] What a nice place. [Fernando] So what is all this? Well, basically, we're all here to have a collective experience. Listen, we share the same time and the same space with Mother Nature. And each other. We return to the origin. All together as a community. Mm. So this is some kind of cult. - What? - [girl] No. [boy] No. [laughs] [girl] This is a spiritual experience. We believe that all of us are linked. That our souls came to this world to find each other, to form some kind of family. - What? - Your hands. Oh. [girl] Like you guys. Something besides blood is linking you two. Exactly. Your souls have chosen this place, and this moment in time because they want to stay together. Right. That's exactly what a guy in a cult would say in this situation. - Don't listen to him. - [chuckles] [Fernando] I was just like you guys at your age, when I was dependent. But then everything starts to change when you try to make it on your own and have bills to pay. I don't wanna live just to work. I want something more. And you too want something more, otherwise you wouldn't be here traveling on your old motorcycle, dressed so weird at nearly fifty years old. - No, wait a second, I'm 40. - [chuckling] - [laughter] - Say what? Age is in the soul, man. I'm sorry. No, but wait. I'm not in this for me. - What? - I'm here for my sister. - No, it was your idea. - Hey. - You needed a life change, Gabo. - I was doing great. - Come on. You weren't doing great! - Excuse me, but, - can I ask you both a question? - Mm-hmm. Are you two alone or do you, uh, have children, family? Well, I... tried to have, uh... children... for quite a while. And after a lot of doctors and a lot of cash, they ended up telling us that we... couldn't have kids I didn't know that. It's not exactly texting material. Or a chat, you know? But it's fine. I mean, getting divorced is bad enough. Imagine with kids. It was horrible, no further ado. [chuckles dryly] [girl] See? Maybe that's why we found each other. So you could open up to one another. In this life, everything happens for a reason. - Always everything. - [Gabo] Mm-hmm. - Dessert brothers? - [both] Oh, yes! - Thanks! Wanted something sweet. - [Gabo] Looks yummy! - I'm taking two. - [man] Hey... - [Gabo] Oh! Mm! - Uh... Oh, it looks tasty. - [girl] Thanks. - Mm! - Mmm! It's tasty. - Mm! Delicious! - [Gabo] What's in this? Huh? - No idea but it's so good. Oh, my! Be careful. They have shrooms. Mm? How many did you have? Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! ["Fools" by Jim Rider playing] Woo! Ooh, ooh, ooh! [chanting] Woo, woo, woo! Whoo! [echoing] Rrraah! [blabbering] Hey, beautiful. I feel that our connection is cosmic, girl. [bleating] Yeah. [grunts] Thank you for this offering. I've never seen someone get that high. [chuckles] No. [bleating] [bleating echoing] - Hey. - Hmm? Thank you. Thank you for bringing me here and... [inhaling] ...being with me now. Although it would've been even better if you had gotten there on time and - not only wired some money like a moron. - Mm. [both laughing] - Ooh. - [sighs] - Hey... - Mm. Mm. [sniffles] Mm. I have a son. What? [gentle music playing] Oops. That slipped out. [chuckles] But what do you mean you have a... a son? I have a son. - So... so I have a nephew? - [snorts] - Oh... - [laughs] What the fuck, dude? [both laughing] - Are you serious? I really have a nephew? - Mm-hmm. - [gasps] - [snorts] I do have a nephew. That's just so incredible. [man] Lights out, my brothers! [gentle music continues] - [gasps] - What are those? Fireflies... [gasps] [Gabo sighs] [gasps] [gasps sharply] Fernando? [exhales] Fernando? [man moans] Fernando. Fernando! - Are you alright? - Wha...? What? - [Gabo] Huh? - What happened? - [exhales] - Are you alright? I think I may have kissed a goat. Did you see the fireflies or was it just me? [Fernando sighs] You told me you have a son. - [playful music] - Really? I guess those shrooms really hit me good then. Because you don't have a son, right? You would have told me if you had. But if you do have a son, it's totally fine. - Huh? - Really? I mean, it's your life, isn't it? [scoffs] Since when are you so understanding and open-minded? Since I know you don't have a son. Mm? I don't. But what if I had one? [exhales] Fuckin' Fernando! What? - Hey... - Ugh! I knew it! I freakin' knew it! No, come on! Gabo, gimme a break. Last night it wasn't that bad. I was high, dude! I'm not arguing about this while I'm starving. - What? - Let's have breakfast. - No, I'm not letting you... - Excuse me... - I wanna eat breakfast, I'm not arguing. - Hang on! - I need something in my stomach. - I'm only asking for an explanation! Come on. cheer up. Sorry, I just can't, I'm still... processing it. What do you have to process? I had a girlfriend, we had sex, we got pregnant. She wanted to keep the child and I wanted to do my master's in London. And that's all. She kept the child and I left. There! Just another old-fashioned life story, okay? So that's it? Easy. Any given Sunday? So carefree and cool? I knew you would try to pick a fight, Gabo. That's why I didn't tell you, okay? What else was I supposed to do? I was just a stupid boy. It's not like I was ready to be a father. How old is he? Fifteen. What's his name? Ricardo. That's the name his mother chose for him. I like it. And, does he know about me? His grandparents and all that? [Fernando] I don't know. I've never talked to him. His mum and I agreed that if I wasn't going to be part of his life, well... I shouldn't contact him at all. Where does he live? In Mexico City, with his mom. Perfect. What? It's on the way. - Let's go see him. - Are you crazy? He's just about the only family we have, Fernando. Besides, it's my turn. And I'm sorry, you're doing whatever I say. - No, Gabo, it's... - Whatever I say, no exceptions. Those are the rules, or what are we? ["Nubes" by Primo Son playing] Did you see that, man? Yeah... [police siren blares] [horn honking] [officer] Stop the vehicles. [Fernando] Let's hear what they want. Let me handle this, please - I beg you, dude, keep your mouth shut. - Why? You have a problem with authority, you know it. - Please, come on! - [car door closes] Just look at these two clowns. I mean it, in Singapore, all the cops are straight out of a Bruce Lee movie. - Shut it. - Man, just look at that. - [officer 1] Hello, ma'am. - How are you, officers? All good? Hello. Where are you from? From San Miguel on our way to Mexico City. You are not wearing helmets on a highway. Yeah, yeah, we know, officer, but we had an emergency. A very serious one, we had to leave right away and we didn't even get dressed, as you can see. So you can imagine we forgot our helmets. - Helmets... save lots of lives, lady. - [Gabo] I know. but we're going through a tragedy in the family, our father passed away. What happened to your dad? Cancer. Tss... Man, I hate that shit. My grandma lost that battle too. - I'm so sorry, officer. - [officer 2] Thanks, ma'am. Well, what can you do? That thing spares no one. - Nah. - But that doesn't justify this situation. I know, my apologies, it won't happen again. I swear it. I swear it, officer. Okay, that's enough. How much for you to let us go? Cut the crap, man! We all know you can get off with a bribe in this village... [grunts] Tlaxcala... is not a village. In our free and sovereign state of Tlaxcala, you can't ride without a helmet. Yes, we know. We know, officer, so tell me, sir, now that it has happened, what can we do now? STATE OF MEXICO ENDS HERE TLAXCALA STARTS HERE [car horn honking] [officer 1] Look at him. He looks like a tap dancer. - [officer 2] Yeah! - [both laughing] [officer 1] Let's see if he can dance. [horn honking] [officer 1, whistling] Hey! [horn honking] - [car horn honking] - Why don't you go fuck yourselves?! Enough! Shut up! [horn honking] - Stop it! - [laughs] See ya next time, overstuffed yuppie! Freeloader! [horn honking] [officer 2] Long live Tlaxcala, assholes! Yeah, go fuck yourselves! [electronic music playing] Wow. [Fernando exhales] - Ow... - Now this is a nice hotel. I know right? It's nice. [grunts] [grunts] My legs are bruised. Really? - [grunts] - [Fernando] Ow! My back is killing me. [knocking on door] [Fernando] Come in! Oh, nice! Should I close it or is someone else coming? [Fernando] No, nobody's coming. Just close the door, please. What's with the rush, huh? I was in the shower. [Fernando] Yeah, well I've been thinking, and I really want to talk to you. Oh, my! You have a living room and everything. - [Fernando] Yeah, don't you have one? - Of course not! That's weird. We are supposed to have similar rooms but whatever, come in. I think this is a very bad idea. I totally agree. It is totally stupid throwing the money away for a hotel room. No, not that. What? Coming to see the rugrat. [exhales] I think it's like that hippie girl said. Everything happens for a reason. [sighs] The rainstorm, the cops. I think the universe doesn't want us to see him. Ooh, don't tell me you aren't dying to meet Ricardo? [exhales] I do want to. [sighs] I just think it's too late. Why would he want to meet the asshole who left his mom? Hey, hey, hey. [chuckles] You're not that much of an asshole. - [chuckles] - If you compare me to an old ladykiller, - I'm amazing, yeah. - [laughs] [chuckles] You love it when people think you're a badass 'cause you have such a big heart. But look, here you are. You could be in Singapore, but you're here with me. No. - What? - I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to convince me to see the kid. - And sorry Gabo, I won't! - Where are you going? - Anywhere but here! - No! - Ugh! Let me go! - You're not going anywhere! He's my son! If I don't wanna see him, that's my problem! - But you do want to see him! No! - Listen! You're projecting on me! Sure, because you couldn't have kids! [grunts] [pants] I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that. [grunts] Ow! Gabo, what the fuck! I bit my lip. [grunts] You're totally right, you are an asshole. I convince myself you're not but every time, you end up disappointing me. No, I'm sorry. I can't believe you don't cry over abandoning your own son. I do cry over it. Over abandoning Ricardo. Abandoning you, abandoning my father. I know I'll never bounce back from that. [bittersweet music playing] But if this is an intervention, I need to drink some tequila. [breathing heavily] What are you doing? Ten bucks - Those freakin' rats. - Yeah. Room service? [Beethoven's "Ode To Joy" section from Symphony No. 9 in D minor plays] [laughs] Mm! Hey listen, the last bite or what are we? Do you want some? - Sure. - [laughs] [both laughing] - [sighs] - [moans] Ugh, I can't move nor breathe. [grunts] Mm. I'm gonna throw up in my bathroom. Good night. [Fernando] Ugh. Bye... Mm. Ugh. Mm. [whimpers] [bittersweet music playing] [exhales] - Hey. - Hmm? Is this jacket too much? How do I look? Let me see. You're fine. You look like an old hipster. [chuckles] You should've bought something else, not just those tennis shoes Hey, I bought the jeans too! Everything's so expensive. - Mm. - And I thought, "If I take too long, he'll get cold feet." No. [sighs] Can I ask you something? As long as it isn't a stupid question. [chuckles] Do you have any regrets? - That is a stupid question. - Come on! I confessed mine last night. It's your turn. Okay. When, uh, - I look at your life... - Mm-hmm. I feel like, maybe, I could have been just... like you. Obviously you could have been, dude. Actually, I thought you would end up working for NASA or something. [laughs] Yeah, right. But there's no point crying over spilled milk. - What the fuck is that? - [giggles] What...? Did you know my passport is still valid? I always renew it. I never use it. But I have this hope that someday I'm gonna travel. [chuckles] [gentle music playing] - You don't want it? - No. How do you know they live here? It's the same apartment she lived in with her mom. She never moved out. How do you know they didn't move? Thanks to social media, you know everything. Dude, you've been stalking them. - [woman] Who are you gonna meet? - [Ricardo] Friends from soccer, mum. - Is that him? - Yeah. - Oh, say hi for me. - Yeah, totally. Have lunch. - Before it's dinner time, okay? - Is that her? - [Fernando] Yes. - [Ricardo] Sure. Love you [Gabo] Good thing he looks like his mum. We saw him. Come on. Hey, check, please. Don't... Gabo, wait! What are you doing? Wait for me! The money is on the table, okay? Wait for me! Gabo! Gabo! Wait up! - Gabo! Come on you can't do this... - Shh! [whispering] Stop talking. Come on. - [Fernando] No. - I just want to see... - Okay... - We need t... - [Ricardo] Hi Mrs Lourdes. How are you? - [grunts] Look. It's a bird nest, right? There's a birdie! Okay, keep moving. [humorous music playing] He seems a little goofy. Ugh. Why would you say that? - [sighs] Hmm. - Give him a chance. Maybe he's like his mum. Oh Gabo, come on! Well he hasn't noticed that we're right behind him. [all] Three, two, one! Game on! - [Ricardo] Pass it! - [kid 1] I'm over here! [kid 2] Take it away! - [kid 1] It's mine! - Take it! - No! - [Ricardo] Goal! Yes! - [Ricardo] Hey! Careful, careful! - [kid 1] It's yours, man! [kid 2] Take it away from him! Wow, he's good. Hugo Sánchez on Real Madrid. That good. - Awesome. - Good! Goal! - Goal! - [Fernando] Nice! - He's better than you at his age. - [chuckles] - [Fernando] Oh wait... - [Gabo] Hey! [laughs] [Fernando] I've got it. Hey, ball! You can toss it over, sir. - [chuckles] - Pass it, pass it, pass it. Pass it. [gentle music playing] So, can we join your match? - Really? - Gabo. Wait, Gabo. - You could use some more street. - All right! Gabo! Gabo, wait! Wait a sec! There's only three of us. - He's right. Come on. That's not fair. - Oh, right. I'll play with you, guys. [Fernando] Okay. Sure. - [Ricardo] Hit it. - [Fernando] Let's go. - Good one! - [grunts] - [Gabo laughs] - What is it? Come on! [Gabo laughing] Good one! - [both] Goal! - Nice! Aah! - Whoo! - [Gabo laughs] Yes! - Yeah! [laughs] - [Gabo laughing] Yeah. - [Gabo sighs] - You're a great player! - [laughs] - Of course! She's awesome! Guys in school couldn't believe it. [mockingly, in raspy voice] "Gabo-Gabo!" Careful! [Gabo] Get it! Oh! [cheering] [gentle music continues] - [Gabo] Woah! [laughs] - [kid 1] Comin' at you! - [kid 2] Over here! - [Gabo] Hey! - [grunts] - [Gabo screams] - [grunts] - [Gabo] Aah! - Yeah. - [Gabo] Come on, do it! - [Fernando] Yeah, you got it! - [Gabo] Goal! Awesome! - [Gabo] Oh, my God! - Hey! [panting] Yes! Mm. - That was fun, right? - Mm! - You're a really good player. - [Ricardo exhales] Thank you. Aww. No way, look at that! Oh wow, guys. My gosh, how cute! [inaudible] They're famous in the park. - Really? - Yeah. They spent 50 years together Suddenly, he got Alzheimer's. She had to take care of him. But it was too much, so she put him in a home. But then she also got Alzheimer's. And they put her in the same home. And, they didn't remember each other. This is the best part. Every day, when they see each other, it's like they meet for the first time. And every day, they fall in love again. Aww. No, something tells me you're full of it. - It's true! - It's like a movie plot. But why would I lie? Are you serious? - [teens laughing] - I knew it! Come on! But that would be cool, don't you think? Well, it's time for us to leave. - Let's go. - Mm-hmm. [grunts] - Good game. - Yeah. Bye, guys! - Bye! - [Ricardo] Nice game. You too. [bittersweet music playing] We don't need a paternity test, do we? - [Gabo] He's a really nice guy. - Mm-hmm. And he really looks like you, Fer. Well he's better looking. And also nicer. And a bit taller. Okay, you talked to him. I hope you're happy now. Mm. Now the hard part of telling him you're his father. I mean, you can do the classic: [mimics Darth Vader's breathing] [in hoarse voice] "Ricardo... I am your father." [breathing heavily] I'm not doing that. What? We've met the boy! He's fine, he's a nice guy. I'll let him go on with his life and I'll go on with mine. So we did all this for nothing? He's better without me. Fer. You were beaming. I've rarely seen you so happy in my life. You can't say you won't do anything. [Gabo sighs] [takes breath] Although, well... Are we surprised? No, we're not surprised. Stop that. Fernando! Whenever you see responsibility, you freaking run off. You're a piece of work, bro. It's good to regret some things, but you have to clean up your shit. Don't be a coward. No, wait a minute! The only coward here is you! [gasps] I mean, you say I left you. Okay, fine. That may be true. But I'm not the only reason you haven't left San Miguel! And neither is Papá! Hey, don't try to flip the conversation around. No, I'm not flipping anything! But you always used us as an excuse. You're afraid of getting out and messing up! I've got news for you. When this fuckin' trip we're making is over, Trust me, you're just gonna go back to your same boring little life! Mm-hmm. Yeah. Sure, fine. Good to know. Yeah, I'm the one making up excuses. Mm-hmm. Cool. - And you? - What? What are you doing? You pretend to be so cool. "Yeah, I don't care about anyone." When your life is a pile of shit. You have a job where no one cares about you and a balcony you don't even use. - At least it's my balcony. - [sighs] I always thought you and Dad were similar. But you really are a fucking son of a bitch, Fer. - Ugh, come on! - Really? If that's your blessing, go fuck yourself. - I'm leaving. - Yeah, fuck you. [Gabo] You're not worth it. Honey. The keys. [keys clatter] See you later, sweetie. Thank you! [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Hello? [Fernando] Hi, Daniela. [Daniela] Who is this? Fer. Fernando Medina. Oh. [sighs] How you've been? Listen, I don't mean be rude, but um, I'm out with some friends. I'll call you later. Yeah. Sure. I'm sorry. [sighs] [exhales deeply] [phone vibrates] [phone vibrates] [phone vibrates] [bittersweet music playing] Hello? I lied. I'm not with anyone. I just didn't wanna talk to you. Right. Yeah, I figured that out. Are you in Singapore? Uh... Yeah. Yeah, that's right. - What time is it there? - Uh... Oh, um, like, uh... [sighs] No. I'm sorry. Sorry... I don't wanna lie. I'm actually in Mexico City. Yeah, I know. I'm looking at you. Why are you on my street? My dad passed away. I'm very sorry. I wanted to see how you are. You look good. And you look... kind of messed up. [both chuckle] You're right. Did you finish your doctorate? Ages ago. Mm-hmm. How's Ricardo? What do you want to know? Does he need anything? How's he doing in school? - Did he get his vaccines? - [Daniela chuckles] [chuckles softly] It's just that I'm worried about it. You know how these new vaccines are high-tech and he may have some... What do you want, Fernando? [exhales] I don't know. Since my dad passed away... I can't stop thinking about Ricardo. It seems to me that you have a lot of regret that you're holding. You want to talk to him so it feels like you did your part. Then go back to Singapore and forget about him again. If you wanna see him, it has to be serious. Do you think you can do that? [sighs] I... Goodbye, Fernando.

[chuckles] - I love you! - Pfft! - [laughs] - [honking horn] [Gabo sighs] Let's see... Ugh, the clutch is loose. - Exactly. That's for sure the problem. - Let's see. Do you need some help, dear brother? No. [cumbia music playing] [man] Wait, wait! [Gabo] You were right. Yeah, I know. About what? I am a coward. No, Gabo. I'm an idiot. Mm, no, I mean it. I stayed in San Miguel 'cause I'm comfortable being there. Mm-hmm. Gabo, you're braver than I am. We're only here because of you. - I wanted to go back right away. - Look. In our week together, we traveled, gotten in fights, the police, I have a nephew! There was even tantric sex. What? I did things I never thought I'd do. I mean it. Okay. Sure. Please elaborate on the tantric sex. You inspire me to do things I'd never do. Okay. Maybe we should rewind to the tantric sex now, please? I'm trying to tell you something beautiful. And I'm listening to you. Without you, I'm just an asshole. Yeah, actually that is true. [Fernando] Maybe that hippie girl was right. Our souls are united and, they look for each other when in need. Ooh, I can picture you joining the cult, huh? - Ooh. - [chuckles] [both chuckle] - Are you in? - Mm-mm, I'll pass. You're not passing. Come on! - No, come on. Put your spoon down. - Thank you, sir. - Is it cool if we play with you guys? - No. Too bad. Sit down, Fer. - Hurry. - No, please, man. Let's bet to make it interesting. - Twenty-five. - Do you find that's interesting? [Fernando] I know! My watch. Come on. It's a knockoff. [scoffs] It's not a knockoff! - It's a limited edition... - [Gabo laughs] I know. The bikes. - You beat us, they're yours. - [Gabo] No! Stop it! No, Fernando! Are you crazy? - Those bikes? - Yeah. - They look like crap! - How dare you say they look like crap? Those are Carabelas from the 80s. They're classics. The parts are original and the brakes are brand new. I've installed them myself - Mm! - Well, there! They are worth it. You have nothing to lose. - No? - No. - Should we? - Yeah. - Let's do it. Come on. - Yeah. Game on. Let's do it! - Did you see that? - How stupid are you? We started this playing ping-pong. We should finish it that way too. Oh, beautiful, how symbolic, but no. Not the bikes, Fernando. Oh please, don't worry about it. I would never put them at risk. Look, that guy, is obvious he's hobbling. And the kid... well. - They can't beat us. - What if they do? No. I was watching them and they're no good. Come on. They don't stand a chance. Let's go. Okay. - Okay. - Ready? - First to 11, wins. - Alright! - Yeah? - Yeah! [playful music] - Good job! - That was a great move! - One-zero! - You're up. - No! Ugh! - Yeah! - Stay out of my fuckin' way! - [man] Two-zero! That's it! [inaudible] They didn't stand a chance? - Well, you're letting them win. - I just ate, okay? Then burp, that's it! - Let's play. - [clears throat] Hey, son. - [laughs] - [mocking laughter] - [man] Come on, ladies. Are you playing? - Yeah. - Just waiting for you, sir. - Go! [funky music playing] - [cheering] - That's what I'm talkin' about! Yee-haw! Let's switch sides. - [man] Keep pushing. You know how. - Ready? [funky music continues] - [screams] - All right! [Fernando] Yeah! - Oh! - Ha! - Beautiful! - [Fernando] They're one point away now! Yeah! - [screams] 10-10. - Yeah! - Next point wins. - Focus! I told you! - Come on. - Hey, Dad. Dad, let me serve. Alright - But don't screw it up! - I won't, sir. [man] Do it now! [funky music playing] - Amazing! - [both] We won! Yeah! Just like his old man! - Bring it! - [chuckles] What is it? Why are you smiling? [playful music] Oh. Nothing. - Come on. - What? Gimme the keys. No. Come on. no. Can we renegotiate? - Renegotiate what, fucker? The keys! - [Gabo] Hey. I'm sorry. There's no need for all this. - Right? - [man] Stay out of this! - Nobody's talkin' to you, crazy lady. - [gasps] Ooh. [tense music builds] - What's your problem? - Gabo, you alright? - [groans] No. - [man] She's gonna pay. [tense music builds] [grunts] - [Gabo] Did you rinse it? - Gabo. Put some soap on it. - More soap. - There? [Gabo] Do you think it's broken? Ouch. I don't know. See? You're not an asshole. - [grunts] - You let them win. So did you. [scoffs] [grunts] [grunts] You're right. [exhales] My father gave us those bikes because... [grunts] - [sighs] - ...he knew we'd need them some day. [blows] What are we gonna do? [in singsong] Extra set of keys. [giggles] Let's move. Hurry, hurry. - Go, go, go. - Did you see that shot? - [boy] That was so awesome! - [man 2] Really tight - Do you want some? - When I saw him... - They play good, but... - [boy] You have a great backhand. [breathing heavily] - [man 2] You know tourists. - He thought I was gonna hit her. No. You aren't... - [engine dies] - Oh, it won't start. - What? It won't start? - It won't start! - Try mine. - Ugh! Goddammit! [engine rumbling] - [man] The bikes! The bikes! - [boy] No fuckin' way! They're coming! Let's go! [Gabo screams] - Come on! - Wait for me! - Hurry! - Wait for me! [screams] Hurry up! [man] Get them now! - [boy] The bikes! - [Gabo screams] Go, go, go! - [screams] - [man] Hey! - Yee-haw! - [whistling] - Whoo-whoo-whoo! - We made it! [Gabo laughs] [gentle music playing] [both cheering] - [Fernando] Acapulco! - [Gabo] Yay! - It's never too late! Never! - [Fernando sighs] Welcome, sis. [giggling] - We did it! - We did it! [both cheering] It's amazing! - Hey, picture, picture, picture. - Wait for me. Ready? [uplifting music playing] Whoo! Hey! [both] Whoo! [phone chimes and vibrates] [gentle music continues] [laughs] [both laughing] [Fernando] We did it! - Whoo! - [chuckles] [both sigh] Ooh! This is nice. You like it that much? Uh-huh. It's a little warm, no? - You didn't! - [chuckles] Rules are rules. They have to be respected. Okay! - [moans loudly] - No! - No! No, that's gross! No! - [chuckles] - The current's going this way! - [both laughing] - [Fernando] Or what are we? - [laughs] [uplifting music soaring] - [horn honks loudly] - Woah! - What's up? - [chuckles] We're home. - We're home? - Yeah. - Oh, my... - Hmm. [grunts] [exhales] - Mission accomplished! [laughs] - We did it. [chuckles] - Ow... - Very good. Are you okay? - You sprained my finger... - Aww. - [Gabo gasps] - What? I'm an idiot! I did leave the lights on! So? Who cares, man? - Thank you. - Absolutely, bro. [sighs] Look. So you don't forget our adventure. [poignant music playing] I'm keeping the T-shirt because I don't wanna forget. Oh... I love you, Fer. I love you. I'm gonna miss you. And I'll miss you too. I love you, brother. - Take care, please. - Mm-hmm. [kisses] [sniffles] [car engine starts] [poignant music continues] [gentle music playing] Thanks. Hello, good morning! Where are you flying today? Everywhere, please. - Wow! [chuckles] - [chuckles] [doorbell rings] [doorbell rings] [Ricardo] Coming! Fer? [gentle music continues] Hi, Ricardo.
