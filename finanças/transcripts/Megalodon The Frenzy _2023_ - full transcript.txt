In an extraordinary and unprecedented incident, a colossal Megalodon shark was engaged in a dramatic battle with a naval ship earlier today. The naval crew was caught off guard, but they immediately went into action. They swiftly deployed their defense systems and activated their antishark measures. The ship's cannons roared to life as they unleashed their firepower against the colossal creature. The Megalodon was a force to be reckoned with. It demonstrated its immense power by seeming impervious to the ship's artillery, launching fierce attacks on the vessel, causing considerable damage to its hull. The naval crew had undergone extensive training and managed to minimize casualties. Despite the immense danger, their swift action and quick thinking helped them navigate through this life-or-death situation. However, the King's crew sustained multiple injuries and even fatalities during the intense battle, including Captain Lynch and Commander Moore, who sadly died when the shark attacked his submarine. Tolbert, do we have eyes on Commander Moore's sub? It's been taken apart, sir. That Meg tore it to shreds just after Commander Moore hit it with a coup de grace. And Captain Lynch? We got visual confirmation from the gunners, sir. Commander Moore and Captain Lynch are dead. You're the commanding officer now, sir. Okay, don't take anything for granted, Tolbert. Keep your head on a swivel. The ship's in bad shape. But the Megalodon is on its last legs. It appears to be continually bleeding, and its movements have slowed considerably. You and the other Marines make good and sure that shark is dead. We've got to get her back to shore. Aye, sir. I'll bring her in. Copy, sir. Crew of the USS King... this is Lieutenant Commander Keith Sharp speaking. The Megalodon is dead, but it comes at great cost. Captain Lynch and Commander Moore have lost their lives defending this crew. I am your new commanding officer, and I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure we all get back to shore safely. All able-bodied crew, please tend to the damage on this ship right away. I'm sending out a distress beacon, and I'm setting up a course for the mainland. Semper fi! - Oo-rah! - Oo-rah! Are you all right? Who cares? Jones, Tilkian, Roberts, Captain Lynch... they're all dead. But so is that Meg. That's something, right? Hard to starboard! All hands, battle stations! Attention, crew. Will all engineers please report to level B1? Wow. Welcome aboard the CRATUS, Ms. London. Oh, um, Dr. Clark. You picked an exciting first day. Oh, it's an honor to meet you. I'm just--I'm such a fan of your work. I've read all of your research. Oh, thank you, but I put my lab coat on one arm at a time just like everyone else. And you can call me Riley. Thank you, Doctor-- Ah! Riley. Don't forget, thousands of students in science and engineering from around the world wanted this gig, and your geothermal engineering research came out on top. That means so much. Thank you. I'm just--I'm so grateful for this opportunity. You know, you've been a huge inspiration for me my whole career, with your developing exploratory missions and heading this entire project. And when you started tapping into geothermal energy to fuel this entire planet. Well, right now, we're at the beginning of the beta testing, but as soon as we launch, we're gonna be fully staffed. When CRATUS II first went live two years ago, I knew I had to be a part of this project. It's incredible that you're not only studying deep-sea life and biomes, but also tapping into a potentially limitless source of natural energy. You want to take a look? Yeah. Is that Volcano 6 right beneath us? Yes, it is. It's been single-handedly supplying geothermal energy to CRATUS II via a mail-well pipe, believe it or not. Phases One through Three involved getting the station operational from her original function as an oil rig. Now we've gone fully beyond proof of concept, and we're moving on to Phase Four. Is that part of Phase Four? Mm-hmm. That phase is CRATUS II. It's a fully operational energy harvester and power plant. It's continually providing renewable and clean energy from Volcano 6. Our goal is to have CRATUS II be fully operational and independent. You know, beyond the usual maintenance. And is it gonna be online today? Yes, it is. That's why we brought you on board. We're gonna have you managing the thermodynamic levels at the flip of a switch. Congratulations. Thanks so much. This way. Hey, Kurt. How's it going? Afternoon, Dr. Clark. Just putting the finishing touches on this long-range remote that should work underwater as you requested. Great. Now, what about those floodgates? Well, that's up next. I need a lot of juice to get those things back up and running, so I'll be tackling that once CRATUS II is online. Now, we can't operate without those. Oh, I know. You must be Dr. London. It's just Ms. London, um, or Kristy. I'm not a doctor until at least a year from now. Kurt Holt is the most indispensable member of our team. You are. You take care of the station, you take care of us, and he has saved us about a thousand times. She's being far too generous. She asks me to fix something, I fix it. That's it. Well, it's great to meet you. Likewise. We ready to launch? Mmm, fully functional. Great. I am going to hand Kristy over to you. I'm gonna go finish up on some preparations. I will see you guys in the sub. Copy that. Okay. All right. Yeah, Brunson has the helm for the moment. Bring me up to speed on the damage assessment. Flyover detected no further threats in the water, so they signaled we're clear to continue to our next rendezvous. Should be able to get there in two hours. Okay, we can make do on our own from now on. Sir, we're down to a skeleton crew at best. The hull has suffered some damage, but luckily, we're taking no water at the moment. Copy that, Tolbert. Damn it. Anything else? Sir, engines took some serious hits. We're currently operating at about 70% power. Sonar and radar are kaput. Our large guns and torpedoes are toast. The long-range radio is acting haywire, too, but we're trying to get it back online. What about fuel? We're at 50%, all within acceptable parameters for our destination. Yeah, that should be enough to get us back to the mainland. We gotta get that engine fixed, guys, okay? At least near enough where we can get ship-to-shore assistance. You know what I'm saying? Tolbert, you give that engine a good once-over. You with me? Of course, sir. I'll do what I can with the tools and supplies we have available. Anything we can do to get that engine moving even a little faster is gonna help, you know what I'm saying? Any breaches in the hull, use a patch kit, seal it off, secure it. We've gotta get this ship to shore. You with me? Copy that, sir. Okay. Hoskins, what about our munitions? Used up a whole lot of ammo shooting at that damn Meg before it was finally chopped up by the rotors. Short- and long-range rounds are both depleted. Some of our depth charges are completely unusable. We lost fully half our total ammo. So we're at 50% there, too. The Ki is entirely at half strength. That's about the size of it, sir. Thank you for your work, soldier. Are we all stowed for the moment? - Yes, sir. - Okay, Son, I want you to take the first watch. You spot anything moving in that water, you alert me as fast as you can. Clear? - Crystal clear, sir. - Get going. Hoskins... grab your rifle. We're not taking any chances. Dr. Clark, we have confirmed that laser fusion will connect Volcano 6 to the CRATUS II station. Yeah. Uh, the submersible is outfitted with a laser fusion cannon. This is gonna be a very simple operation. I'm gonna be in constant contact with you and Kurt. Welcome to your first mission. Thank you so much. All of this, and you can pilot a submersible? You're amazing. Not so amazing. I was brought up on the water. My father was an admiral. I just graduated from a Sunfish to a submersible. I wanted to take the laser out, but she won the arm-wrestling contest, so she gets to go take it out time. You can drive the submersible another time. So you say. Okay, I think I'm off. All right. Hey. We have live feed in your cockpit, so anything you need, just ask. I know. Power on. Power at 100%. Oxygen on. Oxygen 100%. Lights on. Controls operational. Laser fusion drill at full power. Prepare to dive on my mark. Copy that. Standing by. 3, 2, 1... mark. Sub is away. We'll be at our location soon. Copy that. Everything's showing A-okay on our end as well. Step one complete. Continuing descent. Passing the reef now. Thermal vents are coming into view now. Just about there. Sub is in position. Preparing laser fusion drill to provide link between Volcano 6 and CRATUS II. CRATUS II is in standby mode. Ready to receive direct energy. Drill is at full power. Initiating drilling sequence. This is just incredible. I was just sitting in Advanced Geothermal Systems class last week, and now I get to see it all in action. Well, wait 'til they see this. All right, Doc... slow and steady. I know, I know. I want to get this right. I don't want to have to go back to square one. Fusion drill's powered on. Initiating dig. And we are at 1/2 kilometer. We are at 2 kilometers. 2 1/2 kilometers. Kurt, what's going on? Uh, I-I can't get it to link. Running diagnostics now. 3 1/2 kilometers. Kurt. We're approaching a depth of 4 kilometers. CRATUS II is still offline. We should have already diverted to geothermal direct energy by now. Find anything you can about syncing to the energy source. Got it. Our scans are showing abundant reserves of energy between one and three kilometers Nothing unusual on our end. Over. Keep looking. Um... try running a scan .5 kilometers out. There must be something we're missing. We're at 4 1/2 kilometers. We're at 5 kilometers. Contact! There it is. But we may have opened a sizable fissure in the ocean floor, about 250, 300 meters in length. There's no volcanic or geothermal activity down there, but let's keep an eye on it, okay? Copy that. Running assessments on the underlying superstructure and the possible range of volcanoes. Um... Dr. Clark? We've lost visual. Come in. Kurt? Hey, Kurt. Kristy? Is everything okay? It should be. Might have just lost juice due to the extra drilling. I'll get her back. Kurt, Kristy, can you hear me? What's that? Sonar is showing a huge blip, but there shouldn't be anything down there of that size. Dr. Clark, if you can hear me, there's something there, something big. Could just be interference, but whatever it is, it's headed your direction. Over. Kurt, Kristy, can you hear me? Do you hear me? Oh! I think comms are back! - Dr. Clark? - Kurt! Did you see that? Dr. Clark, did you see something down there? Based on its movements and its speed, I-I would think it was a shark. It's agitated. The drill must have disturbed its habitat? Oh. But you did an environmental impact study weeks ago. There should be no large animals of that size down there. Riley, get back to CRATUS now. Kurt, what is this thing?! Kristy, what do you see? We see it on the scanner, and it's still right behind you! You have to try and lose it! This thing is huge! Much more than a hundred feet! Get back to CRATUS A.S.A.P. I can't shake it. All right, give me a second to think! Whatever it is, do it fast! Um, try using your drill's laser. Maybe you can at least disorient it and get a chance to get away. Worth a shot. Here goes nothing! Dr. Clark? Can you read me? Dr. Clark? I'm here. I-- I think I hit it with the laser, but I can't be sure. I think it's still out there. You should be able to see it on the sonar. Let's see. Um... our scanners say that it's disappeared, but just try to get up here, and w-we'll hopefully be able to recover CRATUS II. Checking CRATUS II status. CRATUS II is offline. We're confirming that on our end as well. I'm so sorry. I'm resurfacing. We'll have to figure out how to get that station back online, but keep your eye on that radar. That thing is still out there. I never want to see it again. Over 100 feet. That's a blue whale. They're saying it's far too aggressive. All right, well, let's head toward the island. Roger. Looks totally clear. You? Nothing on the sonar. Copy. Let's head up the coast. Last sighting was just near San Diego. Dr. Clark, are you okay? We can get you a medic or anything. Oh! Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine. Good call on that laser drill. - Kurt. - Yeah? Can we get Dr. Hilton up here, like, now? You got it. I'm glad you're okay. Thanks. So what did the instruments say? Well, according to the sonar, the object was approximately 187 feet in length, and it was fast. It never slowed or stopped. Whatever it was, it was relentless. Just as you made contact with the CRATUS II, a blip showed up on the screen. Huge. Just out of nowhere on top of you. We confirmed with sonar. According to Kurt, it's never been wrong before. 200 feet? What kind of shark is 200 feet long? Dr. Clark... Kurt just told me you saw a shark. Yeah. - At depth? - Yeah. Well, I guess that's not entirely uncommon to be seen in these waters, so... Look, I know it sounds strange, but I've never seen anything this-- It was enormous. We did an environmental impact study, okay? It did not show a single animal in this zone of that size or any of the zones that surround it. How big did you say the shark was? It was approximately 187 feet. The blip was huge. We both saw it. Wait. Earlier this morning, there was a daily briefing from the Coast Guard saying that there was a huge shark attack at sea. No, they called it abnormally large. But if that first one's already dead, then... Look, the largest great white ever recorded is just over 20 feet long. Now, I think what you probably saw is a blue whale, and at that depth, it would make much more sense for it to be a filter feeder. And even so, a blue whale is half the size of the reading you're claiming to have seen on sonar. I know what I saw. It was in my face. Okay? It came right at me. This was not a blue whale. I didn't see baleen. I saw thousands of razor-sharp teeth. It was a shark. The only shark that's the same size as a blue whale is the Otodus Megalodon, and all of our research suggests that that was extinct 3 1/2 million years ago. This thing came right at me and tried to take a bite out of the sub. I nearly crashed the craft trying to evade it. What about the CRATUS II? Well, we're recharging the drill as we speak. It's gonna take a few hours, but once it's back up and running, we'll take another stab at CRATUS II. If there is a Megalodon under that fissure, it's gonna cause major implications to bio, both micro and macro. There could be an entire ecosystem down there, and we just unleashed it. Anything of that size presents an immediate threat to this station, CRATUS II, the well pipe that serves Volcano 6. Look, we gotta figure out a way to track that thing, make sure it doesn't come back. We gotta plug that hole up from wherever it came from, 'cause if there's more of them-- But the only equipment we have is the laser drill. It's still charging up. It's not gonna serve our purposes. The only thing that we have in front of us is to close those floodgates. We've got to protect this team. All right. I'm on it. Follow me. Captain! I see a large object heading on a westerly course, heading directly towards us. Fin in the water! You seein' what we're seeing from the bow, Captain? That shark was dead. I got a visual on another Megalodon fin! Get ready, Marines. Big guns are down, so it's on us. Improvise, adapt, and overcome. Hold a steady course, Brunson. I don't want to have reason to panic unless we need one. Aye, sir. Loud and clear. Crew! Do not fire 'til I give the order. - I don't want us wasting ammo. Copy that. - Oo-rah! - Oo-rah! Eyes up, Marines! All hands! All right, diverting energy now. I'll let you know when there's enough energy to flood them. We've got sonar here, too, but we've also got Rig Perimeter Tracking Software. If there's anything in the water of that size in the area, this will find it. If this thing is really... 200 feet long... it'll show up here. Just let me dial it in around the CRATUS station. So what do we do if we detect it? Well, we get it away from our equipment. We can't afford any setbacks. How? I may be a marine biologist, but I don't exactly have any equipment to secure a 200-foot Megalodon. Then we'll figure something out. We're not gonna let it destroy our research or hurt somebody. Can you widen the range? Sure. No problem. Three-mile radius. Still nothing. Well, maybe it swam away. But where could it have gone? We just saw it. All right, if this is a Megalodon, they can swim up to five meters a second, and at that massive size, they can cover a lot of ground very quickly. It's vital to the survival of our local ecosystems that we find this thing as soon as possible. And, uh-- Hey, if this is real, I guess I'd like to see it for myself. You know... morbid curiosity. Trust me. You don't. Hoskins! You have eyes on it? It's back below, sir! Depth charges port side! Now! Aye, sir. Hurt it with both charges! - Hurt it bad! - But it sure isn't dead. We nearly emptied our entire arsenal on the last one. Stay ready. Captain, we need backup in a bad way. Ammo is low, getting lower by the second. Coast Guard and Navy everywhere near us are getting distress calls from civilians. They need assistance and evac. They will aid us when they can, but unarmed civilians take priority, Marines. - You got me? - Copy that. Okay, give me sit-rep. Are we whole? Negative. It's got a few of us. Richardson, Smith, and Jacobs by my count. Dented up the port side pretty bad, too. Can't repair that until we find shore. Sir, that was the last one of our depth charges. But it looked like it did the trick, at least for now, sir. Well, hopefully it'll be enough to-- that they'll think twice about coming back for us. That sucker was even bigger than the last one. It was like, what, 200 feet? Ship is 600 feet. Damn thing was easily a third of the size. Well, the smaller one killed most of us. I'm gonna try to send out another S.O.S. I need the two of you to keep your eyes glued to that damn water! You so much as glimpse that damn thing, - you let everybody know. Clear? - Yes, sir! 'Cause if it decides to come back and we're not ready, we are all dead, pal. Go! Officer on deck! Come on, man. You know that's not me anymore. Whatever you say, sir. You know, they have me captaining the USS Liberty now. No, I'm just here for the day. Glad to have you back, Captain. It's good to be back. This is Lieutenant Commander Keith Sharp of the USS King on a heading for Jalisco. We've been damaged by a pair of attacks and are in desperate need of assistance. Huge shark in the water. It's already attacked us. Repeat, in need of reinforcements. If anyone in the area hears me, respond. Over. I repeat... this is the USS King... with an S.O.S. going out to all available bands. If anyone reads me, please respond. Over. This is Captain Kasey Keele, uh, captain of the USS Fragasso. We read you. We're about 100 miles out, and we'll go ahead and reroute to intercept you. Over. Thank you, Fragasso. You don't know how grateful we are. Over. Just hang tight. Keep your heading. We'll go ahead and reroute to intercept you. Over. Copy that, Fragasso. We'll see you shortly. Over. Oh, God, shark! No, no! Is there anything on sonar yet? Still nothing. Oh, my gosh. You have to look at this. What is it, Kristy? Oh my God, that's Puerto Vallarta. That's 3,000 miles from here. That's enormous. But that's not the 200 feet that Dr. Clark confirmed on sonar. There's more of them. There must be. Even though Megalodons are fast, there's no way that one could have traveled that distance in that time. We have to warn them. Look! This one's not 200 feet or 95. It's--It's in the middle. There's more than two. I'll go below deck, shut the floodgates. Maybe we can block 'em out. We need to get eyes on it. Let's do it. It was south-southwest. Eyes up, people. On alert. Fin in the water! Oh, my. It's remarkable. The only way to stop this is to observe it. We need to know what we're dealing with. Everyone be on alert and away from the water. Kurt, it's Riley. Come in. How are we coming on those floodgates? Over. Just give me two more minutes, Doctor. As soon as you can, we need them. 60 seconds at most. Over. Copy that. I think it's trying to assess whether the station is a threat or not. What an intelligent creature. Basically, there's a direct line of seismic disturbance from the CRATUS to the ocean floor. And these volcanoes, we've got to hope that those volcanoes are not in the way of this Megalodon. Watch out! Kurt, come in! Are you okay? Did we take a hit? Is there damage? Everybody to the upper decks! Get up safely! Now! Down on the lower decks now. Activated floodgates. Again. Kurt, it's coming back! It's gonna hit the station again! Gates are going down soon. That should protect us against another hit. Wait! Wait! Stop the gate! Doctor, what? Just for a second. No. That's what's protecting us. Hilton, the floodgates go clear down to the drill site, correct? Yes, correct. It's a precaution in case there's an energy bleed or any contamination. If it gets trapped in the floodgate containment area, we could buy a little time to learn how to deal with these Megalodons. No, no. That will put us in extreme danger. That thing could tear down this entire station and us with it. We need to observe it. But having that thing trapped with us is terrifying. You all saw what that Megalodon did in Puerto Vallarta. If it's allowed to swim free, kill, destroy... Yes, we're scared now, but how are we gonna feel if it destroys more human life? We don't want to have to live with that. As much as I hate the idea of trapping it in with us, you're right. And I'd be remiss to say that it'd be my life's greatest work to study a real Megalodon up close. We can figure out how to stop it. Fine. Let's trap it, then. But how are we gonna hold it long enough to make sure it doesn't escape? We only have one shot at this. No... but the sharks are drawn to electromagnetic energy. It's how they stalk their prey. If we could electrify something below the surface with enough magnetism, we could draw it in. Basalt. It's a molten rock. that's magnetic. And considering there is a volcano literally directly beneath us, I would bet that the ocean floor is covered with it, and it's conductive. We can use that to make the Megalodon think there's food down there. Kurt, come in. I need for you to electrify the ocean floor around us. We're drawing the Megalodon in. If I disconnect the mini-sub, drop the power cord to the ocean floor, that should give us a small magnetic pulse. And I mean small. That's ingenious. Anything will do. And it has to happen now, Kurt, now. Copy that. Look at that incredible size. Kurt, now! All right. Megalodon is captured. He isn't happy about it, though. Okay, I think this Megalodon's about 120 feet long. We can assume it's strong, obviously, but is it strong enough to dislodge the CRATUS II entirely? I don't think so. We've got a deep and extremely heavy subsurface anchor. It's got a seismic four rating. These hits to the floodgates shouldn't cause any significant damage. Okay, well, we have it locked in here, but how do we get out? It's not like we can take the mini-sub. The well pipe. I can't believe I haven't considered this. I don't think the Megalodon could critically damage it. It goes several kilometers deep. Yes. However, the energy is flowing through the well pipe unregulated now due to the drill today. And it's building up seismic pressure. If that pressure gets built up enough, it could feed back in both directions, to the CRATUS and to the bottom of the well pipe. That could be devastating. That pressure builds the well to critical mass, it could unleash a seismic blast right along the fault line. What happens if the well pipe unleashes a seismic blast? Well, the worst... the very worst, is that it could create a tsunami. We're gonna have to call for help. Right. We've been out here for a while. Still nothing. Hold. Hold. I have a visual, 10 o'clock. It's big, huge! Those are blues. See the spouts? I'm telling you, it was probably these whales. Eyes up, Brunson. Can't risk another blindsided attack. This is an S.O.S. Does anyone copy? Again. This is an S.O.S. A coast station will answer. They have priority, and we don't have the ability to handle a distress call. This is the CRATUS station. We're a high-security drilling platform. We've just captured a Megalodon shark. We need assistance. This is the USS King. Copy your distress call, CRATUS. Did you say you trapped a Megalodon? Look, I know it sounds insane, but we--we've-- Not at all, CRATUS. We've been dealing with that same enemy for a while now. Okay, give us your coordinates. I've just enabled a beacon with our location. We've been attacked and damaged by a nearly 100-foot Megalodon, and we previously spotted another 200-foot one in the area. The 100-footer is contained, but there is a possibility that it could cause damage to our equipment, which could result in disaster for the Hawaiian island. Are you sure? Yes. We need military assistance as soon as possible. We cannot eliminate the threat of these Megalodons on our own. We have a well pipe in a volcano. If it's dismantled, it could trigger a tsunami that could hit the main island of Hawaii. Okay, we're receiving your signal, CRATUS. We're the only ship remotely close to your coordinates at this time, so we're gonna head straight for you. Help is on the way. Ooh, look at you. Oh, no, baby. You're a big boy. Who's a big monster. Come on, big monster. Run. Run. There. Yeah. Oh, my goodness. Come here. Come on, Shaggy. Over here! Over here! Come on. Hey! Come to Mama! Big monster. Oh, my goodness. You're a big monster. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Come to Mommy. USS Fragasso, come in. This is USS King. Over. This is the USS Fragasso. We read you. We are still en route for rescue. Over. Change of plans, Fragasso. Are you able to route to the CRATUS drilling site A.S.A.P.? They've been attacked by and have trapped a Megalodon at the location. The CRATUS is midway between you and us. We'd be happy to meet you in the middle. Over. Much obliged, Fragasso. I'll put you through to them. You're likely to beat us there, so they can update you on the latest, okay? Over and out. There's been another attack in Oceanside, California. That's 1,500 miles from Puerto Vallarta. How many Megalodons are out there? CRATUS, this is the USS Fragasso. We've been informed of your distress beacon. Over. Uh, this is Dr. Riley Clark with the CRATUS. Who am I speaking with? This is Captain Kasey Keele. The King has updated us on your situation. Can you tell us what's going on? Uh, the Navy fought one of these Megalodons this morning. W-We're seeing a few. There are several reports of attacks on the west coast of California and Mexico. There was just another one in Oceanside. We're aware, and, uh, we've just been informed by the Mexican and U.S. government that there's been a shelter in place for their entire west coast. Hawaii, Alaska, Canada. We also wanted to inform you that both of us are en route to you, but we make it to you first, since the King was pretty severely damaged in their Megalodon attacks. Over. Captain, if that's the case, I think the King may be in more dire straits than us for the moment. Don't worry, Dr. Clark. Civilians always take precedence in these situations. We're about to reroute at the King's request. We'll go ahead and rendezvous at your location. Dr. Clark, the, uh, Coast Guard is getting people out of the water as we speak. Is your location secure? All are currently safe, Fragasso. Currently. But we've got a Megalodon trapped directly beneath our station, inside our flood walls. We're dealing with some prototype technology used to harvest the geothermal energy of volcanoes. What are you doing? That's confidential information. It's the military. They need to know the full severity of the situation. Dr. Clark, you still there? Fragasso, this is Dr. Hilton. There could be a tsunami threat heading for Hawaii. The Megalodon near CRATUS is contained, but we have a well pipe to the volcano that, if dismantled, could trigger a tsunami if the shark hits it. Over. Thank you for giving us a heads-up on what we could be going through. We'll go ahead and alert the Hawaiian Coast Guard. We're about 15 minutes out. Alert us if your situation deteriorates. And I shouldn't have to tell you this, but keep your people out of the water. Over. We will. Thank you, Captain Keele. Thank you so much. Over and out. - That attack in Oceanside? - Yeah? A shark just showed up out of nowhere and killed a dozen people and then went back into the deep sea, didn't stay in the shallows. I wonder why it didn't stick around. Oh. Wait a minute. Hello? Hello? Yes! Helmut, no, we're okay. We--Okay. Okay. We understand. Got it. That was the CEO of Quasar Fusion. The company that funded the rest of your research. You've done your homework. Yes, I have. Well, Quasar said they're working with local authorities and the Coast Guard to keep the area clear, like the Fragasso said. But the Fragasso and the King are the only rescue ships out in the area that can reach us, and they said we might need to get that well pipe offline as soon as we can. And I agree. That tsunami cannot happen. Well, the only way for that to happen is if a massive force were to just run into the well pipe. But we've stress tested it against anything that we can come across. But we've never come across a Megalodon. Even so, a Megalodon weighs 30 to 65 metric tons. We can handle that. We just have to hope that no more show up. Right. We should disconnect the well pipe just to be safe. But without CRATUS II being currently operational, we, uh... we would have to take it offline manually. I hate to say that, but it seems like quite the oversight. Yeah. Well, when this was constructed, we didn't compensate for prehistoric sharks roaming the area. So how do we do that? Just take the pipe offline? Well, there is a shut-off line, but it's underwater. You'd have to get in the water with those Megalodons? Someone would have to, yes. Well, let me lift the floodgates, release the Meg. So we're gonna release it out there so it can do more damage? That's the reason we trapped it in the first place. We know the Megalodon has done damage to at least one military vessel. The sheer size of the King or the Fragasso would send the Megalodon racing towards it like a homing missile. So that's our choice. We keep it in here with us when we have to take the well pump offline, or release it into the open water, where it's guaranteed to create more carnage and death. Great choice. We're still en route to the CRATUS. Are you sure you're still up to assist? Over. Captain Keele, we're still en route, and it's still our duty to protect those who need us. Shouldn't be too long now. Over. Captain, we have a sighting off the starboard bow. We may have our eyes on something. I'll catch you up after we assess. Over and out. Over and out. We spotted it. Changed directions to come for us Been stalking us for the last minute or so. What's the call, Captain? We're not going to wait for that damn shark to make the first move. Helmsman! I want you to take us right at that thing, full speed. The instant we're in range, I want you to light that sucker up. Prepare torpedoes! Prepare torpedoes! Prepare a second torpedo barrage! Damn it. It's taken the torpedoes offline. Where did it go? It's directly under us. Eyes all around! The engines are offline. Captain! Captain! This is the USS Fragasso. Come in, Captain Sharp. Come in! Over! Captain Keele, what are you-- Ran into the Megalodon shark! It's destroying us. I'm coming to you. Stand your ground! Keep fighting! Negative! You've got to get to those civilians! We'll hold out as long as we can. Give them help, Sharp! Work with those scientists on the CRATUS. Find a way to take them out. This is Captain Keele... over and out. The Fragasso gone, sir? Yeah, get us to that station, Brunson, any way you can. We're the only ones who can save that rig right now. Aye, sir. So I did a little digging, and it turns out that, according to the Navy and Coast Guard, these aren't the first encounters with Megalodons in recent times. There have been at least two others on record. The first instance was actually close to Hawaii. The USS Shaw discovered a Russian submarine crew that was trying to break into the underwater cable system, and, in doing so, they released the first Megalodon. Captain Streeper and Commander Lynch, along with Admiral King, managed to subdue the Russians and kill the Megalodon, but not before the Admiral and many of their crew gave their lives. The second incident involved the USS King. I wonder if it's the same ship that's headed here. According to reports, Commander Moore and a Captain Lynch managed to take another one out that had appeared after they intercepted some Chinese Navy ships. I suppose it's a good sign that they can help with our shark problem. But... before they get here, though, I think we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here. The opportunity to examine a real live Megalodon up close. It's a terrifying dream come true. Well, our Megalodon is trapped in here with us, and she's pretty pissed off. If that rage continues to build up, she could take a run at the well pipe, creating a tsunami, which is the very last thing we could possibly need. We don't know how far away the Fragasso is. We're gonna have to come up with a backup plan. Well, what kind of plan? Well, we know there have been at least three to four Megalodon sightings within the vicinity of our dig. Multiple Megalodons, all different sizes, causing incredible damage over a massive area. It could be hunting. This station, it's been open for two years, and this crater was excavated more than five years ago, so why now? What are the two things that every predator, especially oceanic predator, is particularly interested in protecting more than anything? Their hunting grounds... and... And what? Their breeding grounds. The blood spotting in the water, I thought at first that it was just some stray gore from a kill or--or an injury, but... it's in keeping with Selachimorpha labor. This Megalodon... is pregnant. It's spawning? Well, no wonder they're so aggressive. They see everything as a threat to their offspring. We're positioned directly over an underground volcano system. It's some of the warmest waters in all of the Pacific Ocean. We have an abundance of sea life, rich in flora and fauna, and it's all being cultivated by the CRATUS and... the area surrounding it. It's within reason that we may have been creating the perfect spawning ground. And the Megalodons have come here to give birth. Well, we're closed in with one, and she's pissed. These Megalodon sightings, they-- they may have been a combination of females coming to breed and males protecting their young. So the males are protecting the perimeter, looking for predators. To a Megalodon, a Navy ship definitely looks like a predator. Dr. Hilton, how confident are you that this is actually happening? Well, um, judging by the Megalodons' increasingly aggressive behavior, I can say... without reasonable doubt, that, uh... that is a pregnant Megalodon. Well, how many pups can a Megalodon have in its gestation period? Sharks can spawn up to two if they don't eat each other in the womb. And some species can have as many as 100. But we--we don't know that much about... Megalodon reproduction. The only fossils we have on record are those of their teeth. So what you're saying is we could be closed in here with three of these things and the possibility of dozens of pups? And if they become hungry or agitated... they're coming after the CRATUS. The well pipe, as well. Then we have to go down and shut down that valve. And we've got to get rid of as many of them as we possibly can for our safety and everyone else's. What would happen if the females were perceived as being under threat by the males? Well, the males, they would become very territorial a-and try to protect them. What if we were able to draw away the male Megalodons, somehow bring them under the CRATUS, set off a controlled explosion, taking them out, the station... And all of us as well. Yeah, we-- we can't just go off killing this species. They--They were previously thought to be extinct. We need to study them. They're not your friends, okay? We've got to find a way to protect our crew, protect our team. That is job one. Are we clear? Yes, crystal... Dr. Clark. The USS King should lure the males into this region in protective mode, okay? We can use the ship and the sub to try to move them out of range of the explosion. No--What about the well? We cannot set off any explosions until this well is turned off. Unless we want to create a tsunami in the middle of all this chaos. One of us will have to take the mini-sub down to the well, decouple the well pipe from the rest of the equipment. But we need to get to work unless the Marines are on their way. Apparently there are now sightings as far down as Puerto Vallarta. And not blue whales, but 200-foot prehistoric sharks. Unbelievable. Wait, 11 o'clock! Do you see it?! My God, that has to be it. Dopping for a better look. All right, men. Let's keep the ship steady. I'm gonna take one last sweep before we arrive, all right? Aye, sir. How are we feeling, Marines? Hanging in there, Cap. We're still leaking oil pretty steady out the back, and we're down to our last clips of ammo. But we're staying frosty, sir. Staying frosty. That's what I like to hear. Go on, man. Show him. I've been working on something. Show me. During my stint in the Gulf, I picked up a few tricks. IEDs, like frag bombs. Something like that. A bit more powerful than your average IED. The lightweight materials give you the ability to give them some distance. You wouldn't want to get caught in this thing's blast radius. You would not. The best I could do under the circumstance. Don't be modest, man. These bad boys are beautiful. Loaded with spare screws, ball bearings, nuts, washers, and some other pointy bits I found in the toolbox. I figured we don't need the stuff to fix the ship with - at this point. - You figured right. I noticed our bullets didn't do a whole lot of damage. but maybe if we could punch some messier holes in it... You did a damn fine job, Tolbert. We're gonna use those. But be smart. Pick your spots. - Will do, Captain. - All right, now listen up. We get to the station, we gotta move fast. If we don't move fast-- Ho! They're back! Stations! Tolbert, stand by with those frags. Don't toss one 'til you're sure you can hit it. Yes, sir. Okay, aim. Steady. Steady. Fire! Tolbert, stay ready to toss that other one. You see that thing?! Negative! Nothing to port! Now, Tolbert! Eyes? Negative! Anyone have eyes on it? Negative! Fore and aft! See if you can spot it! Everyone okay?! We're fine. We're taking on water, Brunson. Engine's offline, Cap! Can we fix it? I'll get on it now, but it will take some time. We still got a few miles to go before CRATUS. Brunson, check the engine! Tolbert, Hoskins, keep all eyes available on the water. If this thing turns back for us, we're in trouble. Yeah. CRATUS, this is the USS King. Our engine's been hit. We're dead in the water. But we're working to get it up and running now. Last we saw, it was heading right for you, so be on the lookout for a 200-foot Megalodon. We're going to be to you as soon as we can. Over. Stand by, Captain. We've got plan B. Over. I'm all ears. We're gonna take our well pipe offline. Then we're gonna blow these things to hell. Good deal. Okay, everyone, we've got a plan. We're gonna do it like this. Everyone else has been evacuated via helicopter, so it's up to us to finish this. One, I'm gonna be taking the well pipe offline, okay? Two, we're gonna get some remote explosives. We're gonna line the bottom of CRATUS II. Three, we raise the floodgates to lure the Megalodons in. Four, we get out of the range in the sub. Five, we use the remote detonator to explode CRATUS II and hopefully take the Megs with it. Everybody know what to do? All right, you're going to need to get your belongings together. We're gonna meet down at the sub. We've got three minutes. Who did you say was gonna turn the well pipe offline? I will take the mini-sub, and I will turn the well pipe offline. - No. - You can't do that. I'll do it. You're way too important to this operation, Kurt. - We can't do it without you. - I'm too important? Dr. Clark, this is your project. They're gonna need you to make the next one. You need this fixed, yeah? Let me fix it for you. Okay. Well, how close are we to figuring out how to lure the Megalodons here? By changing the frequency of our radio signal to 100 gigahertz, we will cause a massive vibration caused by electromagnetic energy. It'll be sent underwater. It's the same way that we drew in the last Megalodon, only this way uses radio frequency, so it'll travel further. Once we do that, all the Megalodons in the area will be drawn to its source, especially if they think the pregnant Megalodon is in any sort of danger. This should also keep our pregnant Megalodon in the area for us. Well, downside is, they're gonna be more aggressive than normal. Be prepared for that. What if the station loses power? How do you keep that vibration consistent? Well, the station would only lose power if the volcano goes dormant or if the station itself explodes, so I think we'll be fine. What did you say the range was? If my calculations are correct, it should be a couple miles, enough to lure any Megalodons in there, would give us trouble at sea. How soon will it be ready? It's rigged up. I had to make a few adjustments, but we're good to go. Engaging signal. Is it working? - Okay, turn that thing off. - Yeah. We want to give Kurt as much protection as he can possibly have when he goes down there. Kristy, you're gonna go with me. You've got the CRATUS blueprints. It will show us where to plant those explosives for maximum efficiency. Uh, Hilton, get your hard drives, rest of your data. We've got to head down to the sub. Okay, let's go. Kurt. I want you on that headset with me the whole time. Okay. - Okay, come on. - Okay. There. Headed towards the valve. What's the status on the explosives? All good, thanks to the details in Kristy's binder. Oh, I'm sure you could have figured it out, but just wanted to make sure you have all the information you needed. You just pay attention to what you have to do. You know what's out there. Copy that. Headed to lower depths now. - Okay. - We still need a few more, just to be safe. The blueprints are very clear. We don't have anything left. We--Our materials are shot. We gotta sync everything to my watch. Okay. How you doing down there, Kurt? Located the valve. Now I just need to deactivate it, and I'll be back on my way to CRATUS. Come on. Come on. Do we have any more? We're almost there. We need to get to that sub. It's the last one. We're out of materials. Just plant 'em. I'll sync 'em. Okay. You got it. Kurt, are you there? Got it. Valve is deactivated. I repeat, valve is deactivated. You got it. You got it. You guys okay up there? I'm on my way back now. We're okay. Okay. I'm coming in, and I'm coming in hot. Make sure the access bay is open for me. We only got one shot at this. I know. Come on, baby. Come on, baby. It's open, Kurt! It's open! We have to go. We have to go. Ah, come on. Come on, baby. Come on, baby! Come on. Come on! Kurt, are you there?! Kurt?! Kurt, please answer. Kurt, please answer. Kurt, come in. Kurt, come in. Dr. Clark, I'm so sorry, but we have to get out of here. You're right. We gotta get on that sub. We're running out of time. I'm at the sub. Where are you? Everybody okay? All in one piece? Okay, we're all here. We're okay. Ah, good. Okay. A-Are you sure you don't need any more help with-- Oh, God. You've already done so much more than was needed. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't even be here. Thank you. Of course. Now, Dr. Hilton, this is the plan I have in mind. We're gonna raise those floodgates, we're gonna release that radio signal, and we're gonna get the hell out of here. Good. Looking forward to having all this behind us. Yeah. Yeah. Let's get this done. Everyone secure? As secure as we're gonna be. Here we go. I'm gonna set it off the second we get a visual. We don't know if they'll be close enough. They move fast. They're gonna keep following our radio signal. We've gotta be able to act before they even notice us, so you've gotta keep your eyes open. - Ohh! - They're here. Hit that detonator. What happened? It's not linking. Kristy. I-I didn't link it. Uh... What? Kristy, I told you. I'm sorry. We were-- We were locked down, and it was an emergency, and-- Anyone have eyes on the Megalodon? There's nothing on this side. Kristy, is there any way to get that detonator working? Kurt gave you the binder on it. We have got to sink the CRATUS. Dr. Clark, I left the binder on the CRATUS. I'm so sorry. No, no, no, no! We have to get out of here. Hold on. Evasive maneuvers, now! Hold on! Uh, still nothing, Dr. Clark. Okay, give me a minute. Let me think. Maybe if we-- if we circle around and sneak through a gap in the CRATUS structure, they'll get stuck while they're pursuing us. Or--Or at least buy us some time. I can't think of anything better. We're gonna have to do it. Let's do it. There. That's the only gap we can squeeze through. Looks awfully tight. Just trust me. I drew up the blueprints for this sub. We can fit. All right. All right. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Wait. Wait. What's that? Please tell me those are great whites, right? No. Those are its pups. The Megalodon gave birth. This is the crew of the CRATUS. Please answer if you can. Over. This is the King. Over. Captain Sharp, we've got the crew of the CRATUS on the sub. We have five adult Megalodons all over us. One of them gave birth. We're covered in dozens of pups. We're trying to shake them now. One of them gave birth. And these things may be babies, but they're 20 feet long, and they're hungry. Well, why are they following you and not the signal? I'm not sure. They're trying to feed. We're the only thing moving around down here. Okay, what about the detonation? Remote detonation didn't work. We need these things off of us as soon as we can. We've got to bring this lab down. And we can't just trap them inside? Not without getting back inside the CRATUS, and it's not an option. Oh, man. What kind of distraction do you need? These Megalodons, they seem to be attacking the biggest thing in the area. If you could get your ship close to us... they may just peel off. We've got to get them to follow that radio signal, draw them in. Sync it up with the CRATUS, with the blast from the sub, sync the explosion, and then get the hell out of here and take 'em down in the process. We'll make it happen. Just hold tight. Please hurry. Brunson, how we looking?! I think we're ready, sir. Okay, Marines, we need to move this wreck toward the CRATUS now. The scientists need some breathing room to rig the station to blow, and we have to get those Megs off them to buy them a few minutes, okay? We know what that means, Captain, and we're ready. I need to know that you can handle this. We're going into something we've never seen before. Semper fi, Cap. We gotta try to let those civilians get to safety. And if that means we gotta be the bait... then we gotta be the bait. Hoo-rah, sir! Oo-rah! Oo-rah! It's been an honor, men. Tolbert, get whatever you can together, and rig this whole sip to blow. Just in case. Time's a-wastin'. Let's go to work! Cap, heads up! Okay, Dr. Clark. There's your window. There's nothing on the sonar. Are we clear? I think they're gone. I think the distraction worked. Let's find a way to bring this station down. Hold! Hold! Fire at will! Stand your ground, Marines! Make 'em work for it! No looking back now, Marines. If they're still fighting, so are we! Come on! You got that radio signal ready? We're gonna try this again. Okay. Let me just try resetting the signal. - Hurry. - Come on. Come on. Ah, come on. Okay, here goes. Is there anything else we can do? Wh-What about the laser drill? Drill's only at 50% power. But we've gotta take the shot. Kristy, you know those blueprints. What's the focal point I need? There. There, the intersection of those two support beams. If we can punch a hole through that, it should bring the whole thing down. No, with us directly underneath it, There's no time. I'm starting with the laser. You rewire that detonator now. - Okay. - And keep trying the remote frequency until we get a signal to connect. On it. What if the laser doesn't work? Then I'm gonna have to drive this damn sub right through the station. I'm out! I'm out, too! Hang on, Tolbert! Okay, you sons of bitches! Come and get me! Aiming at the weak point now. How are we looking, Dr. Clark? Not good. With the laser at half-strength, it's gonna take a few minutes. Sonar's picking up shapes coming right at us. We haven't turned off the radio signal. We must be the only threat left. Oh, come on. Just another minute. They're coming in fast! How do we get out of here before getting eaten or caught in that explosion? There's no way. I don't know. We have to blow it up now. Wait. Wait. Going full throttle, combined with the explosion, will throw us out of here. Worth a shot. Everyone, hang on. Okay. Uplink! The signal is good! Hit it, Kristy! Ohh! Ohh! Dr. Hilton, damage report. We're breached on several sides. Our oxygen supply is depleting, and our... our laser's broken beyond repair. Engines? No, the engines are fine. Nothing to report right now. Anybody see any signs? Any signs of them? I'm not seeing a thing on this sonar. How 'bout you? No, not over here, either. We actually managed to pull it off. We may have. We just may have. But the sub can only go so far. We gotta find some land. We gotta find some land and wait it out until somebody comes for us. I know a place. You know, we're never gonna know their names. Except Captain Sharp. Lot of good people died trying to save us. And Kurt. Without them, we never would have made it. But we did make it. We did make it. We made it. Hey, I think I see a ship. Hey! Over here! Over here! What? What--We're here. Oh! Oh, God, thank you! Thank you! We're safe! Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you. Over here! Hey! Over here! - We're safe! - We made it! We're safe!
