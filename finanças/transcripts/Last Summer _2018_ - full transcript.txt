Said I'd mow the lawn. Da! I'm sorry. You're not leaving. Don't love you anymore. - It's close. - It's by our house. Come on. Dad, no! Probably Dai shooting rabbits. Can't see it, mun. Let's go, I'm thirsty. Boys, who wants a drink? - Bloody hell, mun! - Water fight! Get him! - Get him! - Get off! Christ. Calm down! - I'm going in for a Penguin. - Get away! No, no!

That's it. You're a good boy, Rex. There's a good boy. Good boy. No, Rex. Robbie... Boys! Get away, boys! Get out of there! Where is he?! I'll get my Da... Come on. Run! Run! Boys! Stop! What's happened? Boys! Dinner's ready! Come on! - Da! - Now! Go and wash your hands! Come on, boys! Move! - Da! - What?! 6, 5, 4, 5. Yes? Alright. Don't stare. Go around the back, see what you can find. On you go. Kev. Alright? It's alright, sit. Sit down. Boys... I'm so sorry. You okay for a minute? I'll just go tell them you're here. Safe, like. Go home, for now. Can't have you hanging around here. - Yeah. - Go on. Off you go. Yeah, OK. - S'ut mae, Doctor. - Hello, Sergeant. Wedi mynd. Both of 'em. He's inside, brains all over the wall. Found the boys. They're in a bit of a state. Waiting by there. Come and have a look at this then. Sorry, I can't give you an accurate time of death, Morgan. I haven't got the right thermometer. I can't see it matters much. Well, here we are. You don't see that very often. Do you want to be sick? No, sir... I know them... The son. Go with him, then. So sorry, boys. So who likes fish and chips? Hmm? Robbie? You wanna... Let's get you away from here, is it. Come on. There's an ambulance! Does that mean she's going to be alright? No, Robbie lad. I'm sorry, bach. Right, come on. Let's go across the fields. Gan bwyll, now, Davy. Do you want some more? It's got a nasty taste. It's alright. Do you want to tell me what you saw? Nothing. We just went in for a Penguin. They can stay with us in our room. On the camp beds. There we are then. We'll get some plates. Hello. Angela. Social Services. Yes. Yes, of course. Um... Which ones are yours then? These two here. Maybe you can take them next door so I can have a chat with the boys? OK. In your room now. Come on. Hey, boys. I'm Angela. I'm here to look after you. Kev, is it? You alright to have a chat? Yeah? Are you working, love? Doing the milk for Dai Hopkins, and some other bits. Regular? Casual. - How old are you now? - Nineteen. We've got two very vulnerable little boys in that room and I think we both want the best for them, yeah? - Where you living now? - At home. It's alright, love. We can't have you going back there. And the boys need proper minding, isn't it? And that's what we're here for. Sorry, Davy. Come on. Off we go. Mum said they can stay with us. Oh, did she? Well, we'll have to see. - But they can, can't they? - Come on, off you go now. - Sandra? - I can't find the spare sheets. We've only got blankets and they're full of moth. - What are you doing, love? - Oh, god. It's too hot for blankets anyway. - Sandra... Sandra, just stop. - Where else are they going to stay? Look, they're sorting that out now. We can't have them here, love. So what are we supposed to do? Nothing. It's down to social services. - Why? - Ugh. Davie, Go on. Go and find your brother. Off! We'll just be a minute. Boy has a hell of a temper on him. Can't say more than that. But the son, he's not a bad kid. He's just a bit of a fighter. Like his father. Has he got a record? - Yeah, only for the fighting. - Right. They've got nowhere to stay tonight. Not proper. They can come with me to the halfway house. Just temporary. Then we'll have to see where we are in a couple of days... It's Davy, is it? Must have been a terrible shock for you. Ah, Doctor... Yes. We were just talking about the boys. Course. Bloody worshiped him, I did. Follow him anywhere but, like, he got so... It's alright, mun. Let it out. Do you want me to say something to them? What do you mean? They're all in there making plans. You should be part of it. There's nothing you could have done. - I ran... - Kev. It's OK... Kev. No, Kev! Sorry. Sorry. Not that, mun. How can you be thinking of that? - I don't know. - For god's sake, Kev. Ugh. Just fuck off, Yvonne. - I can't. - Yes, you can. I know what you're thinking. Just like his dad. A monster that kills his own wife. - Kev... - No. - They were nearly at it. - No. They used to. Used to park down the lane. Car all steamed up. I saw it with Rhys. Shh. Christ, dog! Shut up! Alright! In! Where you taking him? - No need to worry about that now. - Sarge! We need to get the boys settled now, so they come with me to the halfway house, alright? Where are you gonna be staying tonight, love? They're staying with me. Kev, that's not going to be possible right now... I'm their brother. Look, like I said, I need your help here. The boys can't go back to the house and you're hardly in a fit state yourself, are you? Right. Come on, Kev. - No! - Let's go and have a little chat outside, alright? - Doctor. - -Come on, love. Hush, Rex! Davy, get back inside. Now. Go on. Kevin, what do you think's going through those boys heads right now? They need special care. Very special care. And you know what? You've got to help us. You got to step back. Would she want you behaving like this now? Your mother, God bless her. Don't you dare! Take it easy, mun! - Kev! - Come on! What? Just for now, is it? Come on. Hi, boys. You ready to go? You go with Charlie there now, OK? You come with me. Good boy. Well done, Robbie. Good boy. Davy, leave them... - No! - Davy. Where are we going? You and Rhys are coming with me and Charlie, love. We've got a special house for little boys and girls whose mummies and daddies can't look after them anymore. Alright? Just for a couple of days. Are you coming? Can't, mun. I'm not going. Not without Kev. Oh, Robbie, bach You have to go, OK? I'm not! I'm staying with you. Robbie, mun. You can't. I can't look after you. Not proper. Come on now, Robbie bach, time to go, OK? Robbie, Robbie. I'll be round! I will! I'll be round! Tomorrow! And we'll go down the woods, is it? You shouldn't be so selfish. - What you doing? - Going to see. There's been three police cars past already. Ugh. Don't be a twat, Davy. Davy. You gonna tell them? They're arguing again. Wait! - I'm coming, too. - -What do you think is going on in their heads? I don't know. Davy's acting like it never happened and Iwan's like a bloody stone. And it happened right in front of them. What possessed him? - He's evil minded. - Don't, Sandra. - Well, what other reason is there? - God knows, love. - Come, come here. - No, Glyn. Nothing is ever going to be the same again, not for them and not for us. I don't want this dog, vicious bastard like him. Look, we can't keep him cooped up at the station. Kev, if you don't take him, they'll have to put him down. - I want to see the boys. - Well, there's things we got to go through first. - Things I'd rather you heard from us. - -What things? Come on, Kev. Come and have a walk with us. - What? - Look, we need to talk - about your mother. - Where you going? - You knew she was leaving him? - -What do you mean? - To get Rex. - Davy. I'm sorry, Kev. I know this is hard, but she was going to Dai's. You know, to be with him. - Stop now! - -Get off, you fucker! Alright now, that's enough. We've got a duty to keep you safe. Kev, stop! For god's sake! What's the use? - I'm going to fucking kill him! - Kev, leave him be. Go on, get after him. I'll get round to Dai's and head him off. - Get yourself home, boy! - I want to keep Rex. - Out of here! - But we look after him! Now! - No! Rex! - Oh, Christ! You idiot! - Come on, mun! - I'm not. Twat. - Kev. Kev! - What? Listen. Stop. What's the point? - What are you doing here, boy? - It's Rex... He's run off. Well, you better find him then. Kev's coming after you. He's down by the fields now. - Dai. - -Kev, wait! I need you in the house. Now. - Let him come! - Kevin! - Come here! - Oi! Do you know what you've done? I'm going to fucking kill him! You try that again and I'll whack you one! - Dai, bugger off! - Christ, sir! He's upset! - Come here! - Sarge! Get over there! Sarge, please. Open the bloody door! I'll have you! Right. Rex! I thought I told you to go home! Why won't you let me look after him? - 'Cause he's a menace. - Please! Argh. Alright. Get in there! In! How's it look? Bad. Do you want me to get my dad? Na, boy. Thanks for looking out for me there. It was the dog really. Running off. What'll they do to him? Well it's a farm dog. It won't take to being a pet. - So... - Let's not think about it, eh? Gotta go. Gotta ask my dad about the dog. For the boys, like. Hey. Where did they take them then? Social Services, by town. Tell them I'm sorry? When you see them. Made their mam a promise, I did, that they could come and... come here. But they had a home. Yeah, well, you just tell them. What did you do? Just sit... Her and me. That's all. Sit and just look for a bit. And we got used to the idea. She thought she'd come, and the boys. And live here with me. It's nothing if you can share it. You will come and tell me, eh? How they're doing? If you want. Alright, off you go. Go on. Urgh, where you been? There was a fight. They took Kev off. We got to get home and ask Dad about Rex. What you got? - Owl pellet. - You never! - It was outside the window. - I'm going to look. Come on then. Found it just here. Got one. - He's back! - We got to tell the boys. Wow. Wonder what they're doing? We should go see them. They won't let you keep Rex. - Why not? - 'Cause he's a nutter. Boys! What you think you're doing? You cannot go wandering off like that. Not now. Mum, we got to look after Rex. God. No, Davy. God. Don't frighten me like that. You have got to stay close now. It's not safe anymore. - Come on. - We got to. You have got to stay at home from now on. Understand? The woods are out of bounds. You shouldn't be hanging round here anyway. It's dangerous. You're not listening to me, we got to look after their dog! Davy! Things are different now. Alright? What are you thinking about the dog for? Don't you understand what's happened? Nobody cares about the bloody dog! We're going home. Now! No! Davy. Davy, stop! - Get off! - You have got to start talking to me, proper. No, I don't! I don't want to! Look, I'm sorry, right. I'm sorry We can't have the dog. I'm sure we can find someone else who can look after him. I want to see Robbie and Rhys. Oh, come on, now. I'll go on my own then. Davy, stop! Fine! Fine. Alright, cariad. We'll go. They're just watching a bit of telly before tea. Come in. Right, telly off. Uh, I was watching that! Turn it back on! - Turn it back on! - It was so close to the end. Next door, please. Our guests need to spend some time with the doctor and his family. - Stupid! - Shona, Tania, Mimi, off you go now. - Oh, this is ridiculous! - It's tea anyway. For God's sake! Urgh. Probably revolting! Hello, boys. How you faring then? We've been doing fine, haven't we? Please take a seat, Doctor. And Mrs. Davies? Come on in. Davy, you can sit over there on the floor. Hello, Rhys. Hello, Robbie. Have you got everything you need, boys? We can get you something. Anything, really. We can go by the house. Has Kev been over? No? Do you want to play out? Davy. Not now. Why not? Do you want to? Well, it's tea now. But I was wondering if the boys would like to stay? It would be nice for them to have a bit of company. No need. Really. I would. Okay. Good. - Nice. - Have it. But it's chips. Want to go out after? Not allowed. The barn-owl's back. I saw him. And there's loads of pellets. God's honor! Look! Oh, disgusting! Come on, let's go upstairs! Come on, mun. I'll show you. Go fishing if you like, too. And then we'll come back with the bikes. They won't let us. Listen. Can we have Rex? - What? - Just to look after. If you say yes, they'll have to let us. No. He's ours. You got to, mun. They're going to put him down. Put that away! Rhys, cariad, why don't you get down? Come on. So stupid. - Davy. - Rhys. - Davy! - Rhys. - Not allowed up here. Weirdo. - Rhys, mun. Come on, Davy! Time to go. - But we haven't said goodbye yet. - Next time. - What about now? - Davy, we've got to go. But I've got to ask about Rex! - Hey! - Uh, you're not allowed! - Stop it! - Move! - Stop it! - What are you doing? That's quite enough, young man. - You're not allowed up here. - Davy, please. You're upsetting the boys. Please. Come on. I've got him. Right. Girls that's enough. - It's OK. It's OK. - Davy. It's all over, OK? So, what did she say? Not many choices, see. They're talking about a home. Swansea. And what does Kev think about that? They're not telling him. Be easier if he doesn't know. Not before they go anyway. Maybe it's for the best. They never seem to come out of those places well, you know? Lot of rumors. Nasty stuff. Nasty. What do you mean? Sorry, Doctor. Bit of bother with Kev. He's been scrapping with Dai. We need you to check him over before we release him. No, no, we'll see him now. Take him round the surgery entrance. Christ, Glyn. He's not a criminal. How you doing, Kev? Bearing up? Just been to see the boys... You stay in your room now until they're gone, alright? Come on. I'm gonna tell them. - What you talking about? - About them sending the Morris boys away. Don't be daft, mun. Davy! Just make sure... Nearly done, OK? Can we give you a lift somewhere, Kev? - Got a choice, have I? - -Course you have. They pay you extra on a Sunday? That's not fair. - Come on. Let us drop you. - Still following me around, are you? - I'm just doing my job. - Glad to see the back of us, you were. - Come on. - Must have been a bugger landing back here. Think you can sort us all out, is it? Make us all behave? You must leave Dai alone. They're not going to let you near the boys until you do. Yeah. Well, the only reason he's not dead in a ditch already is because of them. - Eh, come on. - Kev. They're sending them off, the boys. - What? - Kev, I didn't know. - Up Swansea. - Kev, stop! Stop causing trouble. You have no idea! Why won't you do something? It's not for us to get involved. - Why not? - Right, go to your room. I said, why not. Sandra, deal with him! - What you doing? - I thought we'd go away for a few days. Stay with Granny. Go to the seaside. - Wouldn't that be nice? - No! Davy, we'll go swimming every day. Get out of this heat. Wouldn't that be nice? - No, it won't. - Davy, you're going! - Don't you dare! - Fuck's sake... Iwan! Davy, you have got to stop being like this. You're upsetting everyone. I'm not going! I'm staying for the boys. Davy. They don't want to see you. - Liar! - They don't want to see you. Not again. Because it reminds them! It reminds them of what happened. Can't you see? They have lost their mother and their father. Don't you understand what that means? Now look, Davy. You have got to grow up now, alright? - See things as they are. - Get off me! We'll go away for a few days! Well, then you'll stay in your room! Davy! Davy, I'm sorry, alright? Just open the door. Davy? Davy. Come on, love. Alright, I'll leave you be. For God's sake, call the bloody vet, will you? Good boy, Rex. Settle. Rex, sh! That's it. Settle. Keep your distance if I was you. He's alright, you know? Just needs a walk. Are you taking him somewhere? Does your mother know you're down here? Yeah. She doesn't mind. Thinks I should get out a bit more after what's happened. Sarge? County, taking an interest. Alright. Hello again, Davy. I know what you're going to do with him. I'm sorry, love. He's not bad, you know? Doesn't like being tied up, see. Can I give him for a walk? Davy, it's not that simple. Give him something nice to remember. Davy. You'll get me in trouble, you will. The boys should see him before he goes. I wouldn't tell them, like. And they wouldn't know once they've gone to Swansea. Go on, Davy. Off you go. Go on. I'm going to get water, OK? Good boy. Stay here, good boy. Won't be long now. Good boy. Good boy. Iwan, love. Go and see if Davy's alright, will you? Could play a game or something. Davy? What's he doing? Nothing. Just doesn't want to come out, that's all. We're just going to play some Monopoly now. Good idea. - You can't come in here. - Why not? 'Cause we'll put a spell on you. We're witches, see. Come on. I need a mirror. Robbie. Is Rhys coming? Upstairs. Go get him, mun. No. I got Rex. Nicked him. He's at the Barn-owl house. Secret, like. Do you want to go see? With Rhys? Can't. Why not? Just can't. I've run away. They're taking us off to Swansea... to live. Don't go, mun. It's not good there. See you later. I heard my Dad talking. Don't go. And What are you doing here, young man? Just wanted to see if Robbie and Rhys wanted to play out. Right. Well, you better get off home now, OK? Better get off home now. Lost something? Where's my bike? Bye. Go on. Bye, go home. What are you still doing here? What a wimp. Give him his bike back. Why do you think we've got it? Because you have. You're nothing special, you know? Just 'cause you're in the papers. - Yeah, I seen it. - Don't you dare! What? Going to go all psycho again like your Dad? Shona, he's not worth it. It's a crappy little bike anyway. Thanks.

It's all smashed to bits. - Well, that's your look out. - You can't leave us! Don't be daft, Robbie. Mum said... Well, come on then! OK, come on. It's dark. I've got a torch. - Is that you? - Huh?

We could just keep going now. Run away. They'll be worried sick, your mum and dad. Come on, Davy. We should go home. No! You're giving up, I can tell. Come on. Enough now. - We got to put it behind us. - No! You mustn't forget 'cause then the bad stuff will just win. It'll be like the good bits were never there at all. - Stop, Davy! - No! You got to, so you can remember it right. Nobody cares about the stupid dog but he was there... barking at your dad, and jumping up and acting all stupid. And your dad came back. Buried his face in his fur... and then he saw me... and he smiled... - like he was sorry. - Shut up, Davy. No. Let him. He wasn't a monster, your dad. He wasn't. He was nice too. And your mum. When my mum and dad were arguing, I used to think I'd rather be in your family. Something just went wrong in his head, like. And if they take you away you got to remember that. Stupid bloody dog.

Mum was leaving to be with him and she didn't want to tell you, 'cause she thought you were gonna blab to Dad. And Kev's going to give him what he deserves, aren't you? - That's enough, Rhys. - No, it's not. You got to. Shut up, mun. Enough now. Enough. I'll come back for you, both of you. Promise. And then we'll disappear. We'll just disappear somewhere. I talked to Dai. He told me to tell you he was sorry. It's none of your business, Davy. They all get away with it, don't they? All of them. And no one cares. I'm not going to let him. Not this time. Davy! Davy! Davy, stop! Where are you going? You tell Kev that he's got to look after you. Cause I'm going to fix it. How? Davy! I'm going up Dai's, alright? We've got to wait for Kev. No. No, we don't. You can't come, Robbie. You'll spoil it. I got to do it on my own. It's the police! Wait for me! Rhys! Davy! Robbie! Boys! Iwan! Davy! Rex! Come on. Get after that dog, get after him. - Spread out now. - Davy! Boys! Rhys! Come on! Jump! Boys! Are you down there? Boys, over here! It's Rex! Rhys! Robbie! Hold on to this for a second. Don't! I'll run! Where are they, Davy? You tell me right now. You've got to find Kev. - Kevin can look after himself. - No, he can't. You've got to find him 'cause he's going after Dai and he's going to kill him. Tell me where they are. You've all just given up on him, you know? - Davy. - You got to help him. He's down by where you used to go. When you was together. The hut by the railway. He likes you, mind. Proper. Loves you. Yeah, we saw it in the hut. Forever, it said. - Come with me now. - No, I got to go. I told you where he is. - Davy! - No, let go! Jesus. Davy! - What happened? - I done it. So you could get away. That's them. They'll have us now. Come on, mun. We need to keep on moving. Robbie. It's got a right old kick. Didn't think it would work after getting in the river. Did though. Work underwater, Kev says. - Never. - Yeah! Good boy. You can keep him if you like. Look after him for us. Come on, mun. We need to get to Dai's before Kev does. You go. I'm puffed, see. It was good. Stay down here forever, I would have. - Robbie, mun. - I'll be alright. Kev will come back for you. He will. See you, yeah? Yeah. See you. Boys, quick. Come on. Come on! Alright. Don't run now, Robbie. Don't run. Rhys! Boys! For Christ's sake, boys! Kept him then? He took that sheep. Killed it. Boys say you got to shoot him. That's the law, isn't it? Never been right, that dog. Always chasing around where he shouldn't. Put the gun down, Davy. It's my fault. I was looking after him and he got away. So now we've got to shoot him. I mean it. Alright, boy. Go on, you'll kill him in the cow shed. Aright, give me the gun. Thought you could let him off 'cause he didn't mean it, like. That's enough, Davy. Give me the gun. I need it. Kev was going to come. - That's between him and me. - No, it's not! Because he'll get in trouble if he hurts you. And it's all 'cause of you in the first place. So I've got to do it. Listen, listen, listen to me now. They'll send you away. - And that's it forever. - No, they won't. 'Cause I don't know what I'm doing, do I? 'Cause I'm just a kid. And with you gone the boys will be alright 'cause Kev will stop. And then everything will go back to how it was. You shouldn't have done it. When she arrived, I thought... this is it. A chance, isn't it? Davy, I loved her, mun. Well, you shouldn't have. He's going to need someone to look after him, he is. Let me go, Davy. She's up there looking for you. Why are they making such a din? They need milking. Davy. You should have stayed with them, Kev. You got to show them. All of them. That you can do it. You're filthy, mun. Come on, mun. Come on! Come here! Bloody cows! Boys! Boys! I knew you'd come back for us. Are you coming home, love? I just want to look. For a bit. ♪ ♪
