Wanhua, my nephew, by the time you get this letter your uncle may have breathed his last. Starting with your grandpa, the Mei family has sung opera, serving the palace and the people, careful never to incur catastrophe. Who dares to not wear red for the Empress Dowager's birthday? You have some nerve. My aunt just passed away. I'm still in mourning. Ouch! Sir, beat me. I deserve it. Because of this, they put a paper yoke on me. Sir, please don't make me wear this. - Just beat me and be done with it. - Move. - What's happening to me? - Rip the yoke and you die. Even stars of the opera are being looked down upon. I don't want you to be beaten, and then have to say, "well done", or to wear such a yoke of shame. Wanhua, open up. Master Shisan is here to see you. What did your uncle's letter say? Quit the opera, leave this "garden". Take your final bow. Turn your back on the stage forever. We want Mei Lanfang, or our money back. - Money back! - Money back! TEN YEARS LATER, THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA Look at this, what can we do? - Hurry. - What a mess. - Hurry, go. - Yes, yes, yes. Hearing my love passed the exam And was Number One in the Court I prayed for him at the temple and went To Hongdong as another man's concubine Mr. Song. - What is it? - You must hurry. The audience at Virtue Hall is about to riot. - You want to go now? - Yes. - Mr. Wang will kill you. - Oh, no. No way. She gave me a bowl of soup And I passed it on to him Oblivious to pending disaster He drank it and made a sound Then collapsed to the floor He bled and bled until he died Is Mei Lanfang coming or not? Give us our money back! Give our money back! Bravo. What's this, blood? Wanhua. MEI LANFANG HAS ARRIVED Wanhua, you're a star. Soldier on. - How's your foot? - It's okay. Huifang. What is it? I've been waiting for you. Come with me. The opera's only half-way through. Didn't you have to rush somewhere afterwards? I'm going to a lecture. I'm afraid not. I've promised Master Lu. Come on. Go on. Wanhua. Sir, I finally got him for you. Wanhua, come and sit. Or... sit here. I said sit here. Understand? Master Shisan is here. - Bless you, Master Shisan! - Fortune and good health to you! Too kind. Thank you. Master Shisan, this way please. You're late, Master Shisan. - Chairman Feng. - Yes... - You invited me here tonight. - Yes... - You've honored me. - Yes... I mean, the honor is ours. So I thought a wash and a shave would be in order. But guess what? When the hot towel covered my face, I fell asleep. Come, let me introduce you. MASTER He can be quite eccentric. He's very important. What's his background? He's a magistrate. Educated overseas. Is there a lawsuit involved, then? Please welcome our speaker, Magistrate Qiu Rubai. OPERA GUILD Tonight is just a casual chat. As it's just a chat, if I say something wrong, please stand up and refute me. Similarly, if I think what you say is baseless, I'll argue back. This gentleman... has come for the lecture. So why so tardy? If your audience arrived late, could the opera begin? You're right. I am very sorry. Who does he think he is? I loved going to the Peking Opera in my youth. But there was something I could never understand. Why does the makeup in Peking Opera make facial expressions so rigid? I worked it out later. It is to suppress the expression of emotion. Female characters paste locks of hair over their cheeks. Why? It's to stop them from laughing heartily. A discreet smile is fine. The official characters all hold their belts. That shows you how to posture. Opera is tied up in rules. In a word, hidebound. - What're you saying? This is... - The truth. Mr. Qiu, you invited us to refute you. I'd rather pay you a compliment. You truly understand opera. Even a rank outsider knows that the makeup conveys dignity and seriousness. And that's why actors have no freedom in Peking Opera. They let themselves be caged. But what about their emotions and sensuality? Their happiness, anger, grief and joy? It's all hidden away. I must compliment you again. Such a magisterial interrogation of the opera shows its crimes are truly great. The Chinese should give up opera. Why go? But you can't keep them away. The theaters are packed to the rafters. You can't chase them away. Are there people who don't go? Sure. Those who don't get it. - Young Fei. - Yes? - That was rude. - Sorry. In Peking Opera, the characters should be flesh and blood. Actors mustn't stick to the old ways on stage or in life. Unlike the heroine Su San, they shouldn't have to suffer, allowed only to petition, but not to rebel. With obedient heroines like Su San, Chinese women were taught to follow the rules. Whereas great theatre shows... how to break the rules. Mr. Qiu! Mr. Qiu, your lecture was so interesting. The points you made were so profound. Profound? Why do they seem so obvious to me? Here are two tickets to an opera. I'd be honored if you'd come. - Chairman Feng. - Yes? - You know what? - What? That friend of yours, he's a... How should I put it? - A good-for-nothing. - A good-for-nothing? His words may be unpolished but his logic is sound. - It's time opera reforms itself. - Really? What's Wanhua up to? Teaching the magistrate how to speak Chinese. - Oh? - What? - See you later. - Hey! Tell Wanhua not to hang around that Qiu fellow. Featherbrain. You ought to see Mei Lanfang perform. He's on soon. Pity tickets are so hard to come by. I have two right here. Announcing Cai Yuanpei. Hey. Liberals like Cai Yuanpei and Hu Shi are here? Announcing Imperial Scholar Zhang Jizhi. The new and the old are all here. All here to see Mei Lanfang. Chairman Feng. - Announcing President Yuan Shikai. - Master Shisan. A Sudden Stirring Desires Impossible Mr. Qiu, what you think? To deny Isn't he... More like a woman... than the real thing? With no true love yet found My youth... Mr. Qiu... It did fly No one Knows the passions Of my sleep I must act proper and shy. Dear Mr. Mei Lanfang, it was my first time seeing you. I'm spellbound. Like everyone else, I'm not sure if I think of you as a man or as a woman. It seemed the act of applauding revealed some secret in my heart. Only one whose mind is clean and pure could express passion in such an exquisite manner. I've made a study of the theatre overseas. If there's anything I can help you with, just say the word and I'll be there. Ma, please try some of this. Master. A Mei Lanfang is at the gate. He's asking for you. Mei Lanfang? - I see. - The opera singer? Mei Lanfang? The Mr. Mei of our acquaintance is no singer. Of course not. - Tell him I can't see him. - What? That's simple enough. Really. He left without saying where. It's hard to say when he'll return. Wanhua, try again another day. I want him to be my mentor. Since he's not home, please tell him I received his letter... and thank him. - See you. - See you. First you don't even like opera. Now you're writing fan mail. Fine. You court him. He comes. Then you avoid him. I have no idea what's going on in your mind. Do you think I'm like that Master Lu? I'm a decent person. My motivation is pure. Master, this takes me back ten years. Seeing the robe the Empress Dowager gave you - still forces me to my knees. - Enough ass-kissing. - What's up? - It's like this. Master Chen is not well enough to sing. Perhaps Wanhua could take his place. - Wanhua, looking for someone? - Master. My life has been so lonely and hard I Was orphaned MASTER SHISAN, MEI LANFANG FEN RIVER BAY When just a boy. Mr. Mei Lanfang, Liu Yingchun waited 18 years for her man's return. Now that he's at the door, how come she's more like a corpse, sitting there perfectly still? - Wanhua. - Yes? What's so urgent that Mr. Qiu writes as soon as the opera's over? Master... I want to discuss something with you. - Young Fei. - Yes? Where's the little gift I prepared for Wanhua? Now I'm relaxed, we can talk. - Master, I've been thinking... - Hold on. You want to make some changes, right? To give your character more movement, right? - Tell me. - You're right. Wanhua, the focus should be on me. Okay? Master, about the opera, I could visit you tomorrow at noon to talk it through. I need to nap at noon to sing at night. What about in the afternoon? I do my mental preparation then. Master would like you to have this. Enjoy it. Master, so tomorrow I'll do as I wish on stage. You'd dare? I married a girl See that? Nothing's changed. From the Liu Family Village But her parents Thought me too poor They chased us Out from the family home Husband and wife Condemned to roam Until we found a broken-down shack It was tough With just clothes on our back I'd no choice but to bid my wife farewell And turn to the soldiering life Friends well met And rebellions quelled They shouldn't be applauding yet. With the king to the capital I did go And asked for leave three days ago To return for my Liu Yingchun My wife, it seems You can't believe your ears Come, let's count It's been Eighteen years Bravo. - Master. - Are you happy now? Master, you were wonderful. We're truly of one mind. Am I an old conservative? Absolutely not. I don't care about traditions. I care about the lack of respect in which we are held. If you change things on a whim, they'll say we're capricious, unreliable. But reform isn't mere capriciousness. They despise us. Right? That's irrelevant. - The opera is all that's real. - Forget it. - Can't be done. - But you saw how great the results were. No one can stop greatness from shining through. - No one's stopping anyone from shining. - Master. I fear you two will soon come to blows. Then we'd really become a joke. How's this for a solution? You each perform three shows for the people of Peking. You do it the new way. Master sticks to the old. I'm not an old conservative. True. I mean each does it his own way. And it'll be clear... who, uh, who gets... the better box-office. - I can't challenge the Master. - Isn't that what you just did? - Young Fei. - Yes. I consent. It's up to Wanhua now. Wanhua, you don't have to do this. You can just buckle down and continue as before. Master is happy to lead you down your path to glory. Thank you for your support. Wanhua, is that a yes or a no? Wouldn't it be a challenge? Didn't I just thank Master for his support? He agreed. I didn't think he would agree. What? You think I'd challenge a kid? - Not unless you were afraid of him. - Well? Master Mei. Those changes were brilliant. Listen up! There's no need to talk behind my back. I'm not afraid. I'm telling you all straight up. From now on, I'm devoting myself to Mei Lanfang's career. I'm with the opera now. I'm done with all this! - Uncle. - Sir, what is it? Wanhua, I'll see you later. Hey. - What's wrong? - Uncle, my dear uncle. Did you really throw away your career? - Sir, this is a matter for grown-ups. - So, this is what grown-ups do? Grandma is so angry she's fallen ill. Five generations of court officials, and now we produce a loser. Wanhua, I need to go and see my mother. I heard everything. It's true. I did quit. Now I'm free. These are sworn brothers from ancient times. Because their country had fallen, they refused to eat food grown on enemy soil, and starved together up on the mountain. You and I are like those brothers. As your sworn brother, my first hope is to see you defeat Master Shisan. The victor won't be you, but this new era. Your time has come. The papers say Mei Lanfang has accepted the challenge. So, they told the press before they told me. Right. This Mei Lanfang thinks he's really something. Barely out of diapers and already challenging you. Victory will be as easy as crushing a bedbug. Ma San. Get to the point. It's like this. I've put together a bet. Gambling on us, are you? What's this? Put your imprint here. If you win, we'll cut you in at forty percent. Ma San. If you want to bet on rooster or cricket fights, fine. If your cricket wins, it doesn't demand a cut. If it loses you don't pay compensation either. Nicer than betting on a living person. Fifty-fifty, then. You could lose if it's not a martial role. But you'll need to do acrobatics. You haven't performed any of that for a while. Oh? Where's that little gift for Ma San? - You're too kind. - Where'd it go? It was just... - Isn't it over here? - Please forget what I said. Please forget it. I haven't agreed, you know. You really think I'd do this for money? I want to show opera fans what I'm made of. I, Master Shisan. No one is your equal. Enough, enough. The Empress Dowager had reason to bestow those gifts. Young Fei. Bring me my ink and seal. Master Shisan, opera king Come see him fight and sing - Well? - Not there. He's already made up. Where could he have gone? The curtain goes up in ten minutes. Master, master, master. Congratulations. The theatre is jam-packed. Wanhua's is only two-thirds full. - Two-thirds? - Two-thirds. Couldn't be. Wanhua, what are you doing here? I can't remember a single line. The princess has stolen a pass for me Happiness wells up in my heart At the palace gate I call on the guard Prepare my steed I'll ride Beyond the wall I think the problem lies with the program. You know what I really want to perform? A Strand of Mourning. But that's not only a new opera, it's a tragedy. People spend money on tickets. They want a laugh and to be entertained. Right? No one has dared to perform it for fear of poor box office returns. I lost today's round. I'll take my chances. It's too risky. Success comes from risk taking. What if it flops? This is a serious contest. Didn't Brother Qiu say my time has come? - Young Li. - Yes? Raise that lintel. - Two inches. - Okay. - Hanju. - Yes? Plaster these posters up everywhere. Don't stop till the sun comes up. Spread the word at the universities. Mei Lanfang is to debut a modern tragedy. Once they see it, they'll know that Mei is with them in spirit, and that they should stand by him. You're lecturing. We just want them to come. That's easy enough. Master Mei, can we really sell out tonight? What story does the opera tell? It's a new one. Come see Mei Lanfang debut a modern tragedy. Couple in arranged marriage die for love. MEI STYLE - NEW MODERN OPERA A STRAND OF MOURNING MEI LANFANG - JIXIANG THEATRE - Master Shisan, opera king... - Get lost... I've been so sick, what's this strand of mourning in my hair? Miss, are you feeling better? I am back in the world. But your husband, he has passed away. My husband has passed away? While looking after you, he grew ill and died. While looking after me, he grew ill and died? Yes. No. Heaven help me. I scorned him as stupid, yet he was the noblest of men. How can I ever repay him? Ma San. Look. Only sixty percent full. Great. I just lost two courtyard houses. And I thought him invincible. The old bastard. My prince In the netherworld Wait for me I'll follow you there Joining you in death - Master Mei! Master Mei! - Thank you... Everyone look over here. - Huifang. - Wanhua, you were fabulous. But I didn't put a foot wrong. If that's so, why'd you lose? Ma San. The stage deserves respect. I won't tolerate its desecration. Bah! Ma San. In any case, there'll be no show tomorrow. Sing again and I'm out another few thousand. Don't think to stop me. You lost. What's the point? Losing makes me even more determined. Then you'll have to compensate me. - Ma San. - Fine. Master, he's talking a lot of money. We should think it over. Coincidentally, I need it tomorrow morning. - Ma San, you... - It couldn't be worth more than me. - See this? - Yeah. The Empress Dowager gave me this jade ornament. Oh. - It's yours. - Okay. I have another gift from her at home. You've seen the robe in the glass case. You can have that too. Is that enough? Without your jade and the imperial robe, you won't be yourself, surely. You're on good terms with Mei's family. I never told you, but I went to their house. His grandmother was beside herself. She won't let him sing tomorrow. - So, you went to see his family. - Yes. There's no need to go crawling to Mei Lanfang. Just show me some respect and we'll let bygones be bygones. What do you say? Ma San, I've given you face. Bow to me again and we'll call it quits. Master, one has to bow sometimes, especially when living in a house with low ceilings. I choose when to bow. Ma San, come back. Take that chair with you. You dirtied it by sitting on it. Fine. You're tough. Why else would they say you're invincible? Don't forget, I want my money first thing tomorrow. - Ma San. - I'll see myself out. - Get out! - You'll see. Master. - Young Fei. - Yes, sir. You really went to Mei's house? - Master, let's not sing tonight. - That's up to you. It's your decision, it's nothing to do with me. Master, please allow me to offer a word of advice. We're among friends. Let's lay it on the table. You have no choice. Face or survival? You can choose only one. If you really don't care about survival, sing tonight. Are you trying to frighten Wanhua? Has he ever lacked courage? Don't stop him. It's a waste of time. No one's talking me out of performing tonight. - You're back. - Yes. Have a seat. It seems that Master Shisan's whole life... has been in preparation for tonight. Wanhua, there's no shame in losing, only in being afraid. Brother, should I sing? I don't know. Master, you can polish it. Petals fall Petals fly Petals fill the sky The General is a tiger among men, but sadly, he's growing old. Pure of essence, pure they stay, into dirt they must not fall. Spring goes, loveliness fades, people and flowers are lost to all. I must take the town within ten days Hold the seal of the general in my hand If in ten days I can't conquer this land My head from the gate should sway Come, bring my horse, and we'll go I will Conquer Dingjun Mountain Wanhua. - Master. - Sit. Thanks. What's up? You came without changing first? Wearing your costume into the real world can sully the character you play on stage. Don't do it again. Okay? Oh. Are they still waiting for you to take your bow? Yes. Our performance of Fen River Bay was so good. I know. We did it brilliantly. Your performance was absolute perfection. Absolute perfection? If Fei hadn't read Mr. Qiu's letter to you, I wouldn't have known what you were going to do. Wanhua, you're going to be very successful, world-famous. Do your best to raise our status in people's eyes. I fought for that my whole life... and failed. I heard you're getting married. I have a gift for you. It's in the other room, in the box. Go get it. Master Shisan? Master Shisan! OPERA KING SPLENDID FAMILY Zhifang, I didn't know that you'd come. There's soup for you. Drink it all up. Don't slurp so loudly. I watched you taking your bow. Bowing is enough, there's no need to wave at them. I only signed a memorandum with the American promoters, but it's still legally valid. That's why it's scary. He can't change his mind now. It's all up to Wanhua, and he still hasn't agreed. But it was his idea to tour. Why wouldn't he agree to go? It's Mei Lanfang's tour. You're not him. I'm his sworn brother. I've already convinced the bank's board into lending him $100,000 for expenses. But we'll have to mortgage his house. The paperwork is a mere formality. I still need Wanhua's approval before signing. But what if the tour's a flop? Be positive. That way you won't fail. That's how you triumphed over Master Shisan. Didn't we agree not to bring that up again? It's hard to forget. The day the Master died, Mr. Fei had gone to fetch a doctor and let him wait. Later, Mr. Fei told me Master was hanging on for me, not the doctor. He sat there... and then he was gone. Mr. Feng. - Brother. - Yes? Will that happen to me too? - Mrs. Song. - Yes? - There's talk of mortgaging this house. - Oh? Why are there so many westerners in the audience? They must be American guests of Brother Qiu. Did he consult with you first? Does it matter? An audience is an audience. But did he consult you? Zhifang. Never mind. You get ready. - Zhifang, you're here. - Mr. Feng. - Brother Qiu. - Yes? Your plan to stake this house on the American tour... I've read it. Let me value what we have first. If the final sum can cover your $100,000 loan then no problem, we'll sign. - And if it doesn't? - Then I am sorry, leave our house alone. I wouldn't want Wanhua to have to sleep on the street. Actually, it's just a formality. Just a formality? Then why don't you mortgage your house? If I could, I'd have done so already. You're different. You gave up everything for him. Wanhua can never repay you for that. That's why you dared organize this behind his back. Here. As his wife you should keep the big picture in mind. True. That's why our home is one continuous feast, at which all walks of life, stars, has-beens, the poor, the rich, friends and strangers, just sit down and eat at will. Every special occasion, we give stage veterans' fruit and mooncakes, and lucky money at New Year. I haven't missed one. All because I don't keep the big picture in mind. - Zhifang, you've got a sharp tongue. - Mr. Feng, I also need to borrow some money. Don't you keep all our money too? What are you implying? I have Wanhua deposit his money in our bank so that he can earn the most interest. He can deposit or withdraw it at any time. He's free to do whatever he likes. Since the day I married him, I've never known him free to do anything. I'm off. The westerners who came today told me that news of your American tour has already made headlines in New York. Mr. Feng, Brother, don't force me. Wanhua? Where's Wanhua? - The orchestra's been playing for ages. - I thought he was with you. He's gone? We'll excuse ourselves... Good for nothing. Mr. Feng's having a party tomorrow. Are you coming? I don't need to follow you everywhere. Oops, I forgot the towel for our feet. - Venerable Master Mei, I'll see you in. - Please, there's no need. What did you just call me? Aren't you Venerable Master Mei Lanfang? Master Mei will do. Master Mei. Thank you. Were you waiting for someone else? My uncle. I'll go get him in a moment. - Are you in the opera as well? - Sort of. I'm just a handmaiden to the painted faces. I'll introduce you to some people. Brother Feng, this is Miss Meng. Wanhua, are you kidding? Miss Meng? Try Emperor Dong, the opera's top male impersonator. - Meng Xiaodong? - Yes. Mr. Feng, I'm not that well known. Master Mei wouldn't have heard of me. You're really very famous. It's only that we've never met. Actually, I once had a photo taken with you. That counts, doesn't it? Of course. I'd just finished opera school. Our entire class posed for a photo with you. Miss Meng has an excellent memory. - Brother. - Yes. - You're Mr. Qiu? - Qiu Rubai. They say you're Master Mei's mentor. I wouldn't presume. Friends, brothers... We are missing a player for the bearded role. Luckily Xiaodong is here. Won't let her go. Come, Xiaodong. What about an excerpt from Lost Battle? - I'd rather sing Plum Dragon Town. - Oh? - But I need a Phoenix Li. - Pick someone then. Master Mei. What is Plum Dragon Town, but Frolicking Dragon Teases the Phoenix. Crescent moon o'er the land does shine Where's your home, o soldier of mine Miss, don't ask from whence we roam Wherever he lays his head Is a soldier's home When you're not made up, you look like a man to me. When you are not made up, you look just like a woman. What nonsense. Anyway, one of you is a man and the other a woman. It depends on whether you're on stage or off. Miss, don't ask from whence we roam Wherever he lays his head Is a soldier's home Brother, you asked for Lost Battle. But she insists on Frolicking Dragon. Don't tease nice girls like me Nice girl, bad girl, I wouldn't dare But for the blossom you have in your hair It's in at such a jaunty angle Suggestively it there does dangle Of my crab-apple flower a joke you make. This flower I will throw away And never wear another from this day Phoenix Li, don't be like that A flower shouldn't lay On the floor like a mat Pick up the flower for this soldier man Come... I'll dress your hair as best I can Wear Wear this Crab-apple blossom I came specially to hear you sing. I never imagined I'd be singing with you, or sheltering you with my umbrella. But to be honest, you didn't sing as well as I expected. I couldn't concentrate. I'm not worth your attention, is that it? That's not what I meant. - Then what did you mean? - You two will perform together, it's settled? If that's what you wish. Good. If Master Mei isn't willing, then forget it. I am willing. He's got no sense of humor. - It's time we were off. - Okay. Mr. Qiu, perhaps you could be my mentor too. You're good. Miss Meng! - Mr. Feng. Jasmine tea? - Lovely. Careful, it's hot. Madam, the Master borrowed someone's umbrella. It's been here for days. I'm afraid it'll get taken. - Put it over there. - Yes. Mr. Feng, you're here. I'm here for my lesson. Zhifang, it's the last show tonight. I should get there early. This entire month of rehearsals and shows, there wasn't a day you didn't go in early. The box office has been great. Can it possibly flop? A show that features the best in opera? I should check it out myself. I've been too busy up till now. Go on then, return that umbrella to its owner. Master Mei, you're early. You're not too late yourself. Why don't you go in? I'm waiting for the key. Oh, it's open. - Then I'll see you on stage. - See you on stage. I've brought you a flower. I'm really quite hopeless. It's men who give women flowers, never the other way round. But the one you have is getting worn. You've already thrown it at me nine times. And at others before me too. For tonight's last show, wear a new one. Just don't thank me. Or I'll take it back. Thank you. You're welcome. A woman's nails are long, but these can't reach you. I have to tell them, it gets better every night. Touch the rough hands. I wouldn't know. It's my first time. I order you. - You want me to touch your hand? - Yes. In that case, I won't. Why not? Stretch your hands out flat. Fine, flatter still. I'll touch, touch, touch... You're so right. There's real emotion there. Didn't I say that? It's in at such a jaunty angle Suggestively it there does dangle Of my crab-apple flower A joke you make This flower I will throw away And never wear another from this day Phoenix Li, don't be like that Zhifang, you're angry with me? You shouldn't make fun of him. You make it hard for them both. Of course they act with real feeling. Would you want them to fake it? Come, come, come I'll dress your hair as best I can Wear Wear this crab-apple blossom Bravo! I've come to return your umbrella. When you stood in the corridor, I saw you had my umbrella with you. I thought you wanted to keep it. If I had returned it then, I'd have no excuse to come again. Come in. - Mr. Qiu. - Yes? Is there something urgent? Should I go in and announce your presence? What's the rush? Here's a paper swallow. It can fly very high. That's not so high. But I made it from a program. There are two names on it. - Whose names? - Mei Lanfang and Meng Xiaodong. Whose? - Another acid-tongue. - Is your wife like that too then? She's a good person. She had me under control. - Is that possible? - Not really. Do you know what I prayed for? Can you guess... - my wish? - Don't tell. My worst fear is that it's not what I'd hoped for. If I could sing with Mei Lanfang forever, that would be wonderful. Are you waiting for me? You forgot about the celebration banquet. Everyone's waiting for you. I'm not going. More people speaking words of flattery. I told Mr. Feng I wasn't going. Also, that ceremony next week for the plaque, please decline for me. See? It's tough being as close to him as I am. A hundred businesses honoring him with a gold plaque, and he decides not to go, just like that. - There are four characters on the plaque. - Brother. Which four characters? He won't let me say. You'll disappoint them if you don't go. You should go to the banquet tonight, too. The show can't begin without its star. Xiaodong is very understanding. You have to receive that plaque, too. See you, Xiaodong. See you. Zhifang, did you see a note in the pocket of my white suit? See it? I tore it up. It had an important address on it. Seven Beitangzi Hutong. Seven Beitangzi Hutong, right. - It's Meng Xiaodong's address. - You don't have to tell me. Zhifang. You want to tell her that you're not going, right? With the gift of this plaque, you honor me greatly. But it strikes me that the "King" title makes things hard for me. If I sing well, I'm the King. If I don't, am I still the King? I'm only an opera singer. All I want is to sing... for the rest of my life. Thank you all very much. Hey. OPERA KING SEVEN BEITANGZI HUTONG Mr. Qiu? What are you doing here? Xiaodong, I urgently need your help. - What's up? - Wanhua must go to America. He has to. He won't just be the star of the Far East, but possibly the biggest star in the world. Right? Please help. He listens to you. Brother. Wanhua? You're here, too. Brother, how do you know where I live? A friend, a reporter, told me that Mei Lanfang often visits Xiaodong's place. It'll be the talk of the town by tomorrow. Brother. Just like you, this is the first time Wanhua's been here. Xiaodong, please do me that favor. - I'll be off now. - Brother, I'll go with you. Be my guest for lunch tomorrow at Yanchun House. Su san left Hongdong County - Waiter, alcohol please. - Okay. Unspeakable misery deep down Would passers-by listen to my heart Hey, singer. Thank you, sir, thank you. Was that Huifang? I didn't recognize him. He used to be such a prima donna. I know you're doing this for Brother Qiu. You think I should go to America, too. - But I'm terrified that I may fail. - There's a lot to be afraid of. A theatre that's half empty, no applause on your entrance. Giving your all on the night, only to be panned by the critics. Our livelihood depends on the whims of others. So true. Do you know what I prayed for that day? Just to be able to see a movie with you one day. We could go today. - The three "cops". - Mr. Feng, Brother. Mr. Mei, at last. You've got to save me. Save my show. The audience is already in. Please don't let me down. I've an important engagement. I can't make it. More important than saving a show? Master Zhu is ill. I know you're from different troupes. But they're demanding you or their money back. - Ask someone else to do it. - We need a star. You're the biggest star there is. Please. And if I offend you by refusing? - Don't. You're not that sort of person. - What sort am I, then? Can't I even go to watch a film with Xiaodong? Is it that hard? Miss Meng, please help persuade him. It's too late. Wanhua. Remember the paper yoke your uncle had to wear? Do you know what the worst thing about it was? The thinness of the paper. The tiniest force could've torn it. But if they could have ripped it off, your uncle and grandpa would have done so already. They couldn't. Now it's on you. Wanhua, Brother Qiu is saying, that so long as it's on you, you mustn't let it be torn. Not even for one day? No? - Stop. - Stop the car. Xiaodong? I need to talk to you. You want me to stay away from him, right? Well, I won't. I'll be there for him every day. Every afternoon, hour, and second. It doesn't matter. Xiaodong, do you understand his loneliness? It's inside him. Wanhua has been with us all these years. And yet in his heart he was always alone. Until he met you. But everything that he has, comes from that loneliness. If you destroy that loneliness, you destroy Mei Lanfang. I understand. But I can't leave him. Don't be too hard on Wanhua. It's only Meng Xiaodong. If he didn't have a secret admirer, I'd be the first to worry. Don't fret. See you later. See you. Coming. The door's open. Gave you a fright, did I? You did. Please, come in. Otherwise people might think I was refusing you entry. As if you'd dare. Should I call you Elder Sister? Call me Zhifang. It's more intimate. Lovely little courtyard. I'll get you some tea. I only drink boiled water. It's cleaner. Then I'll get you some. - Don't trouble yourself. - Not at all. I won't drink it anyway. - Tell me what you came to say. - All right, I will. I'm not your equal. I was a singer once too. But when I married him, I gave up my stage career. I'm not your match, the best actress in the land, with a great future. You didn't come - to sing my praises. - True. I came to plead with you. Please leave Mei Lanfang alone to sing opera. Don't distract him. Can you do that? On my way here, I told myself not to quarrel with you. But see how useless I am. I've come to tell you that you don't own him and neither do I. He belongs to his fans. - Xiaodong. - You startled me. So, you're going away? I'm asking you. Are you going away? You never mince words, do you? It's not that I'm going away. It's that I'm leaving you. Forever. You not only like to kid around but you hold a grudge too. I'm not kidding. It's for real. Of course you're kidding. How could you not be? It's for real. - It's not for real. - It is. - It's not. - It is. Meng Xiaodong will never see Mei Lanfang again. Get changed. We're going to the movies. I'm not going. Mr. Feng is giving a party. - Will they both be there? - Oh yes. I'll trade these for an invitation. Look, here, have them. - They're a beautiful couple. - Aren't they? But sometimes I just have to interfere. Meng Xiaodong. Please. Mr. Chen, welcome. Zhifang agreed to mortgage the house. Wanhua, you can't afford to fail in America. There's no shame in losing, only in being afraid. But they wired to say not to come because of the Depression. How do we respond? Mei Lanfang is scared to tour America. How many words is that? Seven. And in "Mei Lanfang will go to tour America"? Seven, too. Help boost my courage. I'll leave Peking tomorrow. - Oh, Xiaodong... - Brother, this is a letter for Wanhua. Promise you'll give it to him to read on his opening night in America. I promise. He hasn't come? - He's not on my list. - About that matter... - Something up? - No. Brother, let me introduce you to Mr. Tanaka Ryuichi of the Japanese consulate. - Pleased to meet you. - The pleasure's mine. Mr. Mei, a photo please. Together. Xiaodong. I'll see you out. Hey! Stop there, Meng Xiaodong! Don't move! What're you doing? Put that gun down. - Put it down. - Don't move! Put that gun down. I'm Mei Lanfang. Everyone knows that. Don't move! Don't anyone try to leave! That thing's not loaded. Right? Says who? Just do what you have to do. All our friends are here, and they can bear witness. If it's in my power, I'll give you what you want. I want Meng Xiaodong to leave Mei Lanfang. Now! Let go! All right. You can shoot me now. Meng Xiaodong, I hate you. If not for today, Mei Lanfang would never have even set eyes on me, or heard me say a single word. How could I ever get close to him like you do? Since falling for him and the roles that he plays I have forgotten if I'm male or female. Do you know what that's like? Do you? I do. I only ever wanted my acting to bring happiness to people. I didn't hurt your feelings on purpose. Hearing you speak, I want to apologize. Go. Live your life well. That's him! What time is your train tomorrow? Early. Wanhua, don't be afraid. Okay. Don't cry. - Boss Wang. - Yes? I won't sing Plum Dragon Village. But that's what the audience wants. I won't do it. I'll sing anything but that! Never that one again. Never ever. Understood? 1930, NEW YORK How can the New York Times critic write this? He hasn't even seen it and he's already negative. Add to that the Great Depression. Of course, there's no point in regrets. Why are you looking at me like that? I hope you'll succeed. It's not about me. It's about Mei Lanfang. It's about us all. Why concede defeat even before the first show? Why defeat ourselves? I'm telling you, he must succeed. Accountant Zheng, what can I do for you? It's like this. Madam said not to hide financial matters from you. We paid compensation to the assassin Liu Xichang. It was quite a large sum and was paid some time ago. Here's Mr. Qiu's authorization. Wanhua, who brought you the papers? - Brother, you paid Liu Xichang? - What? Wanhua. This Liu Xichang, he was a fan, poor thing. I thought to give his family some money. You're lying. He's dead. He came back to life to sign a receipt? Or did you hire him beforehand? Tell me! You're right. I hired him. To stop Xiaodong, to force her to leave you. Wanhua, you're approaching perfection. I can't let anyone stand in your way. Even if in this case I did the wrong thing. But you'll never be able to bring him back to hear your apologies. I don't regret it. Get out. Liu Xichang wasn't supposed to kill anyone. I didn't know his gun was loaded. What you did was despicable. Criticize me all you like, but tonight, we must stand together. Wanhua, my nephew, by the time you get this letter, your uncle may have breathed his last. What did your uncle's letter say? Wanhua. Open the door, Wanhua. I want to dissuade you from singing. But luckily you have no fear. So, sing and sing well. And do your very best, to endure the paper yoke. Don't look back. Give it your all until the end. How come they're not applauding? Mistress, kill him, please be quick. Kill him? Stop causing trouble. Get lost. Your time has come. MEI LANFANG - CHINA'S GREATEST ACTOR - Where'd you go? - What's this? What happened? - You need to ask? See for yourself. - What's going on, it's... - Crazy! They're going crazy! - Crazy, brother! Crazy! It's total madness! Wanhua, nine curtain calls are enough. Never indulge your audience. If you're too sincere, they'll think less of you. Act aloof and they'll fall at your feet. That's true. Please move out of my way. Wanhua, get in. I need a walk. Wanhua, I don't know when you'll read this. If it's after the show, then I congratulate you on your success. If it's before, I just want to say again, Wanhua, don't be afraid. 1937, THE JAPANESE OCCUPATION OF PEKING I've come today... to bid my farewell. My worst fear has always been... that I can no longer perform on stage. That day... has come, finally. I wish you all peace and safety. Wherever I go, you'll be in my thoughts. I thank you all. Major Tanaka, why are you so late? I went into town to see Mei Lanfang's performance. So, you were late on account of work. I also happen to like Mei Lanfang very much. All previous foreign occupiers of China consolidated their rule by assimilating Chinese culture. The ethnic minority rulers of the Qing Dynasty identified with China through their love of Peking Opera. Mei Lanfang is China's greatest actor. The hundred or so characters he has portrayed symbolize the passions of the Chinese. He represents the feelings of his people, and the Chinese call this their conscience. If we can tame Mei Lanfang, we can conquer China. And Japan will succeed where others have failed. Brother! Are you packed? I've been thinking. I'm not going. You won't be singing. What use will I be? We've already got the tickets. You decided to quit, just like that. Three generations' blood, sweat and tears, thrown away? You might be able to let it go, but I can't. If the Japanese don't leave, does Peking Opera have to die? If Germany occupied England, would the English have to give up Shakespeare? If Peking Opera survives, the country will live on. Really, it's best if you come. I won't go to the station. Take this... as my farewell. Don't let the opera die! You startled me. Don't just sit there. Help tidy up and we'll be off to the station. Brother Qiu was here for ages. Waiting for you. When you didn't come, he left. Madam, I need to ask you something. The master's phonograph records aren't going with us, are they? I packed them into that case. They're staying. Yes. What are you doing? Madam, Master, this way! That way. The train to Shanghai is about to leave. Leave for Shanghai. Give it to me. It's mine. - Stop fighting. - He's eating my toffee apples. The kids have been saying that once the Peking sweets are gone, that's it. Give Daddy a taste. - Uncle Feng! - This is wonderful. Uncle Feng! Shanghai has no fried dough, but it does have sweet cakes. Thank you, Uncle Feng. Not so fast, you'll trip. Watch the steps. Zhifang, you've lost weight. I feel so much better now that I've seen you. Go on, practice the piano. Master Mei, please perform at my theatre. If you won't give me face, there's nothing I can do. But this is the French Concession. - There are no Japanese here yet. - All right... All right. See you later. - See you later. - Wanhua, you don't want to sing? I do. Who's there? Coming... There's a Japanese here. Please accept Mr. Sun's invitation to sing. I just turned it down. I meant it. I thought I was doing a good deed. Whatever happens to China, Mei Lanfang must live on. Would anyone want to see a tarnished Mei Lanfang? He turned it down. I'm sorry. Yes. I know. My commanding officer wants to see you. When can you come? You mustn't go. It's unavoidable. I might as well get it over with. You have to tell me. Where are you taking him? Mr. Mei will be received with courtesy. Take him away. - Major Tanaka. - Where're you taking him? - Calm down. Listen... - Out of my way. Major Tanaka! Major Tanaka. Let him wait inside. Mr. Mei, have you thought it over? I've already told Mr. Tanaka the answer to your question. What did he say? He said he already gave Major Tanaka his answer. Tell him to answer me. Mr. Mei... I won't perform. - What did he say? - He won't perform. Why not? Do you know how many times I've seen you perform? What? Speak Japanese! When you first came to Japan, I was only 15. He said when you first performed in Japan, his uncle took him to see you. He was 15. His father had died in battle. Tell him, he just prances around the stage playing stupid women. Our chief says you just prance around the stage playing stupid women. Tell him, off stage, I'm a man. He says, off stage he's a man. This blade has cut off the heads of many enemies. Why wouldn't it cut your head off too? Japanese soldiers mustn't treat Mr. Mei like this. What? Say that again. I beg you. Do you remember me from Mr. Feng's place? I recognized you when you came to my house. You were our guest that time. You left your cigarette case behind. My father left this to me. Thank you. Will they come back? JAPANESE MILITARY BASE, OUTSKIRTS OF PEKING This is Mr. Qiu Rubai. Tanaka Ryuichi. We've met. What do you want? Tell me. Mr. Tanaka wants you to ask Mr. Mei to give two shows in Shanghai at the end of the year. He gives you his word the shows are strictly commercial and not for any other purpose. Mr. Tanaka hopes Mei Lanfang can sing forever. What makes you think... I could talk him out of retirement? Because you're like his other half. No matter who wins this war, Mei Lanfang must live on. Your accomplishments will be immortal. Go too, give our Shanghai address - to Qiu Rubai. - Yes. Sorry... Stop... What the hell are you doing? Who is he? You know you're plagiarizing Mei Lanfang? - I know. - You know! So, you've stolen his moves. But why not do them properly? Do you know what this scene depicts? - Why don't you enlighten me? - It's not a bawdy play. Not a bawdy play. Precious Concubine Gets Drunk is about a jilted concubine who, though cast out and heartbroken, remains dignified and noble. You're one to talk about dignity. I'll show you some acting! You want a fight? Hello? Master Mei. SHANGHAI SOUTHERN TELEPHONE BUREAU Master Mei, it's been puzzling me. You've always been so good to your audience. You've always cared about them. How could you not perform? I'll stage the show and it'll be a sell-out! Good, all right, see you soon. Steamed bun! Steamed bun! The Red Cross confirms that on December 13, 1937 Japanese troops occupied Nanjing. And just now... You tricked me. Lied to me. You said they wouldn't be used for propaganda. You planned it as a victory celebration all along. You're so despicable. But didn't you call the radio station? I was confused. I'm a bastard. Just leave Mei Lanfang alone! Last night Mei Lanfang called in to say he'd return to the stage, just as the Japanese occupy Nanjing. Of course... We don't even need to ask. - It could only be Qiu... - Mr. Feng! Don't even mention that name. Ever since Wanhua met him, it's like he's been kidnapped. Wanhua, what did you do to make him want to hurt you like this? Madam, some awful person threw this rock over the wall. It broke a window. I thought you'd want to know. - Mrs. Song. - Yes? - Throw it away. - Yes. No amount of explanation can clear the air on this. The Japanese have entered the Concessions. Deliver the press conference invitation to Mei Lanfang yourself. Yes, sir. Get out. - Out! - Madam, please. Get out. Leave or I'll summon the police. Madam, please, don't... - Zhifang. - Don't call me Zhifang. - Wife of my Brother. - You're not one of us. Can't I just give Wanhua a script? - Get out. - Sir. What's wrong? Master Qiu, Mr. Qiu, can't you just let him be? Can't you leave him alone? - I beg you, I beg you. - Madam... Madam, you'll injure yourself. Sir, you won't like me saying so, but if I were you, I wouldn't have come. - I'd be too ashamed. - I beg you. - I beg you. - Zhifang. Madam, please calm down. Please calm down. Brother, I'm not here to apologize. As a Japanese man once said to me, "No matter who wins this war, Mei Lanfang must live on." You're quite a boot licker. So that's your rationale for trapping the man you've always supported? The noble Qiu family produced a traitor. Move. I'm not speaking to you. Brother... I... I never... I'd never set him up! You normally win, but not this time. Wanhua, there's a war every other year. You are sacrificing your art. Everything will be reconciled, dissolving into thin air. That's how the ordinary world works. But you... You are not meant for an ordinary world. You should know what's right. Even if people misunderstand you. But you once told me, "it's not good enough to live, but one must live for the good. Live well, live right, live without fear." Those were your words. Have you forgotten? I won't see anyone for a few days. Bring me Dr. Wu's number. The morning of the press conference, he'll give me a typhoid shot. I heard that it makes you sick, gives you a high fever. Your lips crack. That's how I'll appear at the press conference. Also, we should pay off our debt to Mr. Feng. You're preparing your last will? Wanhua, let's not do this. Is there more soup? Yes. Zhifang. I'm sorry for what happened before. Mr. Mei, let me go over this again. You'll have a strong reaction for a few days. You'll run a fever and might fall unconscious. I know. Wanhua All glory turns in the end to dust. By the time I understood this, it was too late. Uncle wants you to be a mere mortal, who lives a quiet and peaceful life. MEI LANFANG PRESS CONFERENCE Mr. Mei, this way please. It's been a long time. Hello, everyone. Although this is a press conference, I've already said everything I want to say. Why grow a beard? Why play this joke on yourself? It's not a joke on anyone. It's for real. There was an old singer, whom I called Master. Just before he died, he said to me, "Wanhua, please do something for me." I asked what. He said, "raise our status in the eyes of the world. Let us be seen as worthy of respect." I agreed. But I'm really at a loss as how to make good that promise. I think... this is the best I can do. Wanhua! Wanhua! His supporters are called the Mei Clique. He's affectionately called Darling Mei by many. His style of singing is called Plum. And in China, the plum blooms in winter. This is Yoshida. The plan for Mei Lanfang will proceed as planned. If I can do anything to stop this from happening, I... will. THE CASE OF MEI LANFANG MEI HUA STUDY - Brother. - Yes? Okay. These are your letters to Wanhua. Take them. If you do, his debt to you will be cleared. This letter, it isn't mine. It's from Wanhua's uncle. I don't know how many times he'd read it. It always put him in a trance. I still don't know what it says. "I hope you'll leave the world of opera. I don't know if you'll listen to me. You lost your parents when you were young. You often shout for me. But I seldom respond as I don't want you to feel even lonelier when I've departed from this world." What a life we've led. When we were young, I never let you wear anything fashionable, not even fancy leg wraps. You need to live a true life in order to play well on stage. You've always listened to me. Because of me, you gave up your one true love. If there's a next life, I won't stand in your way again. I'd do as you wish. I see now that... you wanted an ordinary life. Maybe, you've always been just an ordinary person. Uncle! Uncle! Yes. 1945, JAPANESE SURRENDER Thank you. Please stay where you are. I need to get made up.
