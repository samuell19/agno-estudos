Whoo-hoo! "'Something's wrong in this house', the mouse said. 'I can hear it. There's no noises at all. There's no Christmas spirit. There's nobody laughing, there's nobody singing. No carolers caroling, no jingle bells ringing. The family inside are all quiet and strange.' The mouse wondered what could've caused such a change. 'I know what to do! I'll bring them together! I'll make up a plan. I'll be very clever. I'll think really hard tonight outside while it's snowing. I'll get them all going without even knowing. They'll make cookies and cards and raise a big tree. Wrap presents and candy canes tall as your knee. And then as they sit before their Christmas dinner, each person among them will think they are the winner.'" And that is how the mouse started his adventure last year. - [cheering] - Yes! Sara Edwin! All right! Now, if you enjoyed last year's book The Mouse Who Missed His Christmas List, you're gonna enjoy Sara's new holiday book even more. Yay! It's called A Mouse in the House for Christmas. And you can get it starting tomorrow at this bookstore. Don't forget! Sara's new book! Every child will want one! Don't you think you're overselling it just a little bit? Nonsense. Kids today have the attention span of a housefly. If you say so. I do. You know, you really have your finger on the pulse of Christmas. Do you write from experience? If you like the books, Ed, don't ask. Oh, thank you. - Hello. - Hi, honey. Hey, Dad, what's up? Sara, it's your grandmother. She was leaving her condo, walking down the stairs with some friends when she became lightheaded. She fell and sprained her ankle pretty good. They're taking her to the hospital right now, and, well, I figured maybe... you could break away, come home a few days early. Dad, my new book is coming out. I have appearances to make. The EMTs think there might be some kind of heart condition. As it is, your grandmother can't go back to the condo, so she'll be staying with us... at the house. Dad, you know Mom and I are just gonna argue and ruin things for everybody. Please, just do this for me and your grandmother. She really needs you. Whoo! ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Hittin' the road ♪ ♪ Hittin' the road again ♪ ♪ This Christmastime ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Hittin' the road ♪ ♪ Hittin' the road again ♪ ♪ This Christmastime ♪ ♪ This Christmastime ♪ ♪ I'm hittin' the road ♪ Take your time. Be careful, everybody. All right, lift up and swing you around. There you go. Watch Mother's head, Tim! Oh, just leave him alone, Michelle. He's fine. - Comfortable? - Thank you. Yeah. All right. - Mr. and Mrs. Edwin? - Yeah. Here's the deal. Evelyn will need to stay on bed rest for several days at least. She can use her walker to go back and forth to the bathroom, but that's gonna be about it. It's very possible she could be suffering from orthostatic hypotension. That causes a dangerous drop in the blood pressure when someone rises too quickly. The blood flow gets restricted to the brain, so... let's play this safe. Okay. Thank you. Hey, kiddo. Hey, Dad. Thanks for coming. Of course. Sara. Better late than never, I guess. You're welcome. Oh, Sara, you made it! Morning, Gran. How you feeling? Better, now that you're here. Oh, well, that's good. Hey, you about ready to roll? I've been ready. Let's git. Sara, when you're finished, we need to get Mother home. She must be very tired by now. I'm done, Mom. Thanks. [kiss] I'm sorry. Nothing changes. I'll see you at home. Tim! [sighs] I'm coming. Are you all right, Mother? I'm fine. Let's hit the gas. I can't tell you what it means to have you here for Christmas. It means a lot to me too, Gran. And thank you for the lovely books. Ah, it was nothing. Besides, I thought there might a few you didn't have. I had so many plans for the holidays, and now they're all ruined. Gran, I'm sorry. Were they big plans? Well, not so big, but... I did put 'em all down on a list. Wow. Look how organized you are. "A Perfect Christmas List," huh? I probably wasn't gonna do all of 'em, but I did wanna make my special Christmas cookies. Maybe you and your mom can bake them. No, I don't think so, Gran. Oh, why not? Aw, come on. Why don't you make an old lady happy? I may not be around here forever, you know. Shh! Gran, I don't wanna hear you talk like that. Besides, I just rub Mom the wrong way. She's so perfect, and I'm so not. And she must remind me of that every five minutes. Sara, your mother is not perfect. She's just pretending. That's her way. I know, Gran, I get it. But trying to get the two of us together to do something is like pouring gasoline on a fire. No, you keep it, dear. Maybe you'll change your mind. Don't get your hopes up. What a terrible thing to have happen right at the holidays. Well, maybe it will convince Evie to sell that condo, move into someplace a little more suited for her. - She might have to. - She shouldn't be left alone. Remember that kitchen fire she started at Halloween? She can't even remember to turn the stovetop off. Yeah, well, she's forgetful, but independent. Very independent. Controlling, dear. She's controlling. [doorbell rings] Don't worry, guys, I got it. Hello. Uh, hello. Can I help you? Yes, sorry. I'm Dr. Read. I'm here to see Evelyn. Come on in. Thank you. Over here. Mom, we have a visitor. Sara, who is it? Gran's doctor. Seriously? A doctor making house calls? There's still a few of us left. Dr. Read. Tim. Nice to meet you. Well, her room is right this way. Great. Thank you. Mom, you have a visitor. It's your doctor. Hello, Evie. Well, I'll leave you two. Okay. Thank you. So I heard you took quite a spill. - What happened? - I don't even know. One minute I'm up, and the next, I'm down. Oh, man. You gotta be careful. Well, the hospital sent your chart over to me, and it looks like there might be something going on with your blood pressure, so you're gonna have to take it easy till we figure out what's going on. Do you mind if we check it now? Can I stop you? Not a chance. - You're such a bully. - Yeah. Just because I care. How's the ankle? Does it hurt? No, it doesn't. And I don't have orthostatic hypotension. We hope. [pumps air] [air releases] So do we think maybe that big move is in order? Yes. I've been thinking about it now for a while. This settles it. I gotta get out of that condo. No more stairs for me. That's what I've been trying to tell you. I know, but I just needed a reason. DR. READ: Well, it looks like you finally got one. So have you told your family yet? EVIE: No, not yet. I've been putting that off. I understand, but you're gonna have to tell them sooner or later. You're gonna want them close by when it's time to go. Do you want me to talk to them? Oh, no. No, no, no. I'll tell them. I mean, they're gonna all have to work very closely together to clean out my condo when this time comes. Well, it won't be for at least a week or so. We know that much for sure. Tim! Tim! What is it, Michelle? Mom is dying. What? Mom is dying! Says who? Her doctor. I heard them talking about her illness. It's fatal! Honey... they usually can treat these kind of things. All she needs is some rest and maybe no sudden movements. She'll be fine. I heard what I heard when I heard it. Well, her doctor did make a house call. Why would he do that? - You don't think... - Yes! Oh, no. All right. Well, I have to run some errands. Your blood pressure is in normal range, which is very good news. You just have to make sure you keep resting and keep that foot up. You just like bossing people around, don't you? Doctor's orders. Bye, Evie. You guys all right? Yeah, yeah, we're fine. Allergies, that's all. Ah-choo! Allergies? Right. Well, I've gotta run. It was nice meeting you folks. Doctor! Isn't there anything you want to tell us? Um, nothing you don't already know. I'm just glad that she's surrounded by her family during this difficult time. Isn't there anything we can do? Just try to keep her spirits up... and make sure that the next week's a happy one. I will. I will. I promise. That's good. Bye. Poor mother. She is so brave. Keeping that secret inside and everything. We must respect her wishes. Of course. She can't know that we know. I won't let on. And don't tell Sara. Sara? Are you sure? Of course I'm sure, Tim. I'm the daughter. It's only right that I know. She's the granddaughter. Just trust me. Mom, are you awake? Y-Yes, dear, yes. We were wondering if there's anything we can do for you. You know, anything at all. No, I'm... I'm fine. Why? We just want you to be comfortable. Is the bed soft enough, hard enough? Thank you, Tim. Thank you. Are you sure we can't get you something to eat or drink? Some iced tea? Really, please, anything we can do for you. Anything at all. Anything? Well, I was just thinking about... the great Christmases we had in Vermont when you were young. Yes, I remember. Snow a foot deep. Perfect for sledding. Perfect. Oh, I would give anything if you and Sara could experience a perfect Christmas like that. You know, truth be told, we may not all be together again like this next year. Mom, don't say that. Well, you never know what's around the corner, Michelle, so I've put together a wish list of Christmas activities for you and Sara to do together. A wish list. Wouldn't that be fun? Th-That does sound like fun. Okay, if that would make you happy. Oh, so happy, so happy, dear. Sara has the list. Okay. Doesn't that sound great, Tim? That's nice. What's the first activity? Baking the perfect Christmas cookies. Baking? Baking. Knock, knock. Who's there? Do you have a minute? Do you have a minute who? Ha ha. Very funny. Are you drawing something for one of your little book things? Yes, Mom, one of my little book things. Is there something I can do for you? Yes, yes, there is. I was just chatting with Mom, and she had this great idea. And she told you about the perfect Christmas list. She did. You can't be serious. I am. She's very ill, you know. This could be our last Christmas together. It really could. So do you wanna do the list with me? Are you asking me? Yes, I'm asking. Please. Oh, okay, yeah, sure. Good. So, the first challenge on Grandma's list is to make Christmas cookies. But don't worry. I've got us covered. This oughta do the trick. What is that? It's a cookie gun. You just shoot the dough out of that nozzle-doodle thing. It makes perfect cookies every time. Mom, that is horrible. Why? Do you have any idea how many preservatives are in this stuff? If you shot it into Gran, she'd last another 80 years. Sara, don't be silly. It's Christmas. Cookie guns are flying off the shelves. Well, these cookies have to be homemade, so I'm going to the store and getting the proper ingredients. All right, all right! I was only trying to make things easy for you. Mom, if we're going to do Gran's perfect Christmas list, we might as well do it right. Michelle, why do you have to argue with her? I thought you were gonna behave yourself while she was here. I was. I was going to. But she arrived a few days early. I wasn't ready. ♪ Oh, the countdown's on ♪ ♪ Just a few more days till Christmas comes ♪ ♪ Gotta decorate Got shopping left to do ♪ ♪ Yeah, the countdown's on So move along ♪ ♪ Gotta get things right for Christmas morn ♪ ♪ Here he comes ♪ ♪ Here comes Santa Claus ♪ Salted? I don't think so. Soy butter? Hmm, tempting. But not today. Bacon butter? Ugh! Do you mind? I actually could use that. Oh, hey, it's you. Hey, it's you. You actually want that? Um, yes, it works in one of my recipes. Do you know how much sugar is in that lemonade? Probably too much. I mean, there's like no juice at all. I hear you, but it goes a long way. I'm sorry. I should just mind my own business. I mean, you are a doctor, right? Yes, I am. But you're right about the lemonade. So you're after some butter? Yes. We're baking cookies from scratch. Okay, well, then I think you'll probably want something special like this. It's from a local farm. All natural ingredients. I do a little work for them sometimes. I thought you only treated people. Uh, I do. But I am also... a handyman. "Brandon." Hmm. "Odd jobs done evenly." You weren't kidding. I've always wanted to just fit in wherever I could, so I look in on the elderly, lower income families, pretty much anyone who needs a little extra help. They pay me what they can, when they can, if they can. That's very generous of you. It's nothing. A lot of people helped me out when I needed it, so I'm just trying to pay it back a little. Fair enough. Of course. Well, thank you for the tip on the butter. Organic. I guess you do know the good stuff when you see it. I like to think so. So you are Evie's granddaughter, the writer. That's right. We all feel pretty bad she's stuck in bed, hence the homemade cookies. Mmm. That should do it. Never known cookies to fail. All right. Cane sugar. Baking flour. Raisins. Okay, what am I missing? Oh, beats me. When it comes to baking, I'm a total shortcut kinda guy, Ooh! But I can always use some of these. So what's up with all the hot dogs? I'm cooking for a lot of people. I can see that. But hot dogs? I mean, there's nothing... Okay, you could at least spring for the all-natural, all-beef kind. You are right. It will kill my budget, but will put these back just for you. Don't be feeding those hot dogs to my grandma now. In your grandmother's situation, I'd say any meal that suits her is just fine by her doctor. But these doggies are not for my patients. Oh! I think I get it. You're also some kind of Little League coach, right? Yeah, sort of. Mm-hmm. Well, I should get going. Can't keep the chef is waiting. Your boyfriend's a chef? No, no, no. It's, uh... It's my mother. Well, Merry Christmas and, um... good luck with your cookies. Merry Christmas to you, too, and your kids. Looking good. Of course. The calculator never lies. I didn't realize how essential algebra was to oatmeal cookies. Imagine what you could've baked if you'd gone to Harvard. I can't find the measuring spoons. - What do you need? - Half a teaspoon of salt. Oh! No problem. My grandmother never used measuring spoons. She would just pour stuff into the small of her hand and it came out perfect every time. Mom, that's ridiculous. Found them. Ah ah ah! Told you. I don't believe it. All finished? Oh, yes. Dinner was perfect. I'm glad you liked it. I brought you a treat. Michelle, the smell of freshly baked cookies filled the house all afternoon. - Oh, I'm sorry. - No, don't be. I thought I died and went to heaven. Mom, please don't say things like that. It was just what the doctor ordered. - Did you have any fun? - Sure I did. It reminded me of some things I'd forgotten, so yeah, it was great. And now we have something tasty to remember the day. Hey, Pops. You wanna try one? Hey. Thank you. Mm! Well? Very good! Glad you like 'em. Well, I learned a few things today. Yeah, me too. Thanks for coming home. I didn't want to. You begged me, remember? Well, you're a big girl now, Sara. Well... You'll have a lot of important decisions to make in your life, but I think you made the right one this time. I did it for you and Gran. But sometimes I wonder. About what? I was in the market earlier today, and I saw Gran's doctor. Oh? He seemed so sharp at first, but his entire cart was full of junk food. I mean, fake lemonade, fruit punch, more packs of cheap hot dogs than I could count and a giant block of bacon-flavored butter. What do you do with that? That's what I thought. There was nothing with any nutritional value whatsoever in his entire cart. And did you feel compelled to tell him all about that? Well, of course. Do you do that a lot when you go to the market? Sometimes. Mm-hmm. "Mm-hmm." Okay, what's that supposed to mean? Ah. Don't judge a man until you've walked a mile in his bacon-flavored shoes? I'm just putting it out there. Ohh... I need a drink. ♪ Oh, we wish you a Merry Christmas ♪ Ever since I came home, my mom's been acting weird. Not exactly nice or anything, just weird. And you think she's up to something? I don't know. As rude as she is, she's actually been on her best behavior. Maybe she finally realized she's wrong. Please! You don't walk away from a literary scholarship at Harvard to write and draw children's books. I might as well have just stabbed her right in the eye. Why does she care, as long as you're happy? Happy and successful? Why, indeed. I don't know. I guess it's just 'cause it wasn't her plan. It's not what she had planned for me. Some parents want you to be everything that they never were. And you're an only child, aren't you? That's right. Her one shot at glory, and I let her down. Not this kid. I lived up to all my parents' expectations. Oh, Ashley, do you want me to buy you a drink? Kinda, yeah. Oh, but I think what sets her off the most is the fact, as soon as I left home, she lost all control of me. She just can't stand it. Well, take this week to get to know your grandma. You'll be a better person for it. And if not that, you can work on your next book. The Mouse That Bombed Its Mom. Oh, Jeez! Okay, girl, you better watch out. 'cause I'm gonna steal that from you. Take it. It's my Christmas gift to you. Would you like a cinnamon roll? I thought I smelled something. I only heated them up. I'll take two. Don't get spoiled. Too late. - There you go. - I know. Dad, are you gonna eat both of those? Yes, I am. Would you like a cinnamon roll, Sara? "Enriched flour, niacin..." - Sara. - Hmm? Did you sleep well? I did. I'm going to bring a cinnamon roll to Gran with her coffee. Excellent idea. Here. Mmm! Morning, Sara! Morning, Gran. How you feeling? All glued to this bed. Life's tough at the bottom. Mom made hot cinnamon rolls. Your mother? I never known her to make breakfast. Eat it and weep. Well, looks okay to me. Dad's had two already, and he's still kicking. It's a Christmas miracle. Yeah. I think it's straight already, Mom. How many times do you have to do that? It only looks straight to someone like you. It's not perfectly straight. And it never will be. That's your problem, Sara. You never see what's wrong with the world. And you can never see what's right with it. Well, you are going to love the next activity on Gran's perfect Christmas list. What is it? Number 2. Gran thinks it's high time we had a real Christmas tree. The perfect Christmas tree. A real tree? But you and your father put up the artificial tree every Christmas Eve. Mom, if we don't have a real tree, it's gonna kill her. No, no, no, we'll get it! We'll get a real tree! We will get a real tree and a Dustbuster, but we will get a tree! Okay, Mom, easy. Oh, and we also have to cut it down ourselves. Cut it down ourselves? Cut it down? Are you sure? Let's ask. Mom? Mom. Mom? Mom! We'll get the tree. We'll get the tree! I'll never forgive myself! [screaming] Michelle! What are you doing? - You're not dead. - Not yet! I'm sorry. Have you lost your mind? I'm so sorry. Go back to sleep. Go back to sleep. Sorry. Go back to sleep, Mom. Go back to sleep. It's all okay. Well, that was exciting. We're gonna get right on that tree thing now. I'm sorry. There just aren't any live Christmas tree farms within 150 miles of here. Guess there's just no market for it anymore. Just have to tell her it can't be done. No! I mean I don't want to disappoint my mother. This list business means so much to her. We're just gonna have to think outside the box. Where there's a way, there's a will. Or something like that. Mom, it's not the end of the world. Mom? There. Really? You're not suggesting that we... I am. Honey, that tree's 20-feet tall. We only need eight feet of it. That's crazy. My mother wants a cut tree, and that is what she is going to get. Come visit me in prison. Hi. Dr. Read? Brandon. This is Sara, Evelyn's granddaughter. Yeah, that's me. That one. Um, I have a question. You wouldn't happen to have a small chainsaw that a girl would be able to borrow for the evening, would you? You do? Great! Oh, no, nothing special. Just a little sawing is all. Sure, around 5:00? You know where I live. Okay. Hi. I brought you a present. - Come in. - Thank you. So, uh, do you know how to use one of these? I mean, it's not a toy. I used cut my own firewood, I'll have you know. I'm a regular lumberjack. I should've known. I guess just give me a call when you're done with it. You got it, Doc. Thank you, by the way. So how's your grandmother doing? Oh. She's sleeping. That's perfect. That's what I hear. Okay, well... good night. Good night. Well, he's seemed like a very nice young man. And a doctor too. He seemed too good to be true. Mom, please. What? I'm allowed to have an opinion. Really? I hadn't noticed. Stop, you two! Please. Okay. I'm sorry. Don't we have some cutting to do? Right! Wow. That's a big tree. It's a perfect tree. Okay. Strike one. All right, one more, one more. Not bad. [groaning] - Oh! - Uh-oh! [screaming] It's all yours now. Stand back. [motor revs] Can't believe the things you two have been up to these past few days. I can't believe it either. Something's gotten into Mom. She's changed some. Yeah, she has. Dad, is something wrong? No, no. I think she just wants to make Christmas the best she can for everyone, for her mother's sake. Why? She's never cared before. You might ask yourself the same question. Me? Please. Dad, Mom and I are nothing alike. Are you so sure? Yes, I am. Then where have you been the past few Christmases? Dad, you know why I don't come around. And what about your grandmother? Why can't you come around her place? Oh! That is some kind of tree. Sure is. Just a little off the top, huh? Come on, you two. Breakfast is on. Dad, I'm sorry. I don't know what to say. You know I love you. I'm gonna go check on Gran. Gran? Gran? Don't get excited. I'm coming, I'm coming. Gran, you're supposed to call for someone if you need help. Exactly, but I didn't need any help, so I didn't call for any. Fair enough. How's the ankle, Gran? Oh, it's fine, darling, thank you. Oh, Tim tells me that you got the tree. Yes, and it's a beauty. Can't wait for you to see it. But before that, we have... "Make the perfect Christmas cards." Do you want to go on, dear? You really don't have to. So far, so fun. Besides, this doesn't look too difficult. But you have to use an old photograph from a past Christmas on each card. Gran, do you remember the name of the Christmas book I wrote last year? No, I don't. I forgot. But I loved it. Uh-huh. It was called The Mouse Who Missed His Christmas List. Oh, that's right, yeah. It's about this mouse who moves into a house where everyone is divided. But he brings the family together again by convincing them to perform a special list of holiday activities. Oh, that is such a lovely story. You'll find all the old photographs out in a box in the garage. I really don't like sacrificing my old photographs to make Christmas cards. Mom, what's the problem? Well, you have to cut them up. It's gonna destroy them. Mom, they were just rotting away in a box in a garage. Sara, they weren't rotting away. They were being preserved. All right. We won't cut them. We'll just tape them lightly to the outside of the card. Okay. Hey, look who it is. Hey, Gran! Mom, are you sure you're well enough to be doing this? I'm just gonna sit here and watch. What good is a perfect Christmas if you can't even experience a little bit of it firsthand. Mom... All right. We're happy that you're here. Oh, look at the tree! So beautiful. I'm glad you like it. I'm sorry that I tried to suffocate you yesterday. That's okay. You just scared me a little bit there. Hey, take a look at that. I wanted that bike so badly I think I took it to bed one or two times. [chuckles] Oh! Look at that hair. I look like a squirrel. [squeaking] I never approved of that bike. I thought it was far too dangerous for such a young girl. But your father had to prevail. Don't let her fool you. She allowed me to prevail. Well, it was a pretty bike. Well, someone is getting this on their card. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [laughs] That's a picture of your mother in high school. They used to call her "Shell." She was so serious. Even then she wore collars that were so stiff and sharp it would cut her neck like a razor. - I still have the scars. - Oh, stop it, you two. Give me that. Give me that right now! Oh! Look at this. Oh, my! Look at this handsome fella. What is that? One of those hippies or a gypsy or something? Excuse me. What's the matter with her? The man in the snapshot is your mother's father. Your grandfather. Wait. What? So the portrait in the living room, the soldier in the uniform? It's the same man, Sara, all cleaned up. That was after he was drafted into the army. But here is the real man that I married. Oh, he was so sweet. He just didn't know how to keep his head down when all those bullets flying around. You remind your mother of him, more than you'll ever know. How? I mean, how? He loved to draw and make up silly stories, just like you do. Really? He never took anything very seriously. Some people think that's what got him killed. Oh. That's your Christmas ring. Yes. It's time to put it on. It's really pretty. The last thing my father gave me. I remember how excited I was when I opened it on Christmas morning. It looks new. Yes, well, I only put it on once a year. Dad always said it would bring the wearer much happiness. Hmm. Did it? No. But it's very pretty, isn't it? It really is. Sara... the man in that snapshot, that was your grandfather. That was the man my mom married. I should never have put him in a box. No, I shouldn't. Going skating? What? You look like you're getting ready to hit the rink. Oh, no. I don't skate. So says the girl holding a pair of skates. Oh, no, these old things, no, they're useless. Useless? May I? If you want. I don't think they'll fit you. Well, you should try it sometime. I could teach you. You don't say. I got your message. Did everything work all right with the cutting of your own firewood and such? It did. Thank you. Not a problem. Are you doing anything tonight? Because I would love to show you around the ice, if I even were to promise that you wouldn't fall and break anything. Well, if I did, you'd be right there to patch me back up. Right. So what do you say? - Definitely. - Great. Maybe. Then it's a date. Mm-hmm. Mom, I brought you some tea. - [laughter] - Here you go. Oh, thank you, dear. Ah, the home-baked cookies. Oh, I'm gonna get fat if you keep this up. Oh, it's the holidays. You're not supposed to think about things like that. Well, I guess you're right. But I am the one that forced you to bake them in the first place. But what do I care? Nobody forced anybody to do anything. And I'd do it again in a heartbeat. You would? Absolutely. Why? What do you mean, why? Why are you acting so different all of a sudden? Sara! No, Gran, I have to ask. Well, I guess I just realized how suddenly things can change. I think we should make the most of the time we have together while we have it, okay? Sara, your mother's working so hard to make this a perfect Christmas. Aren't you having a good time? Well, of course. That's what worries me. Oh, Sara. All right, Mother, what's next on your list? This should be interesting. Next up we have... drumroll... Ice skating. Ice skating? Ice skating. - Ohh! - Ooh! Nothing says California Christmas like the inside of an ice rink. Must be 36 degrees in here. 32. She knows I can't skate... I don't know what she expects me to do. What are you afraid of? You're a fast learner. Easy for you to say. You can skate. That was a long time ago, remember? I put that all behind me. You didn't have to. You had talent. You could've been great. Yeah, and I could've also baked cookies at Harvard if only they had a cooking class. You know, sometimes I think you gave up on these things just because I wanted them for you. Really? You just thought about that right now? Right now? Come on, let's go put our skates on. ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells Colder in a wishing well ♪ ♪ Wishing that this holiday would make your way ♪ ♪ To celebrate Christmas here with me ♪ ♪ Whoo-hoo ♪ Look at those kids go. They make it look so easy. Like they don't have a care in the world. Like nothing else matters. It's just you, the cold... ice. Did you say something? Huh? No. - Oh, look. - There they are. Good evening, Mrs. Edwin. Right on time. I try to be. Oh, I get it. This whole thing was set up in advance. Well, a refresher course wouldn't hurt. Shall we? Oh, no, no, no. You two go ahead. I'll wait right here. Are you sure? Yes, I'm fine right here. Besides, I'd like to see Sara skate again. Mom... Have you been holding out on me? Well, a girl has to have some secrets. Well, we'll be back. Let's see what you got. [laughing] ♪ Can you feel the love that's in the air ♪ ♪ Mistletoe and holly everywhere ♪ Well, thank you for meeting me out on the ice. Thank you for saving me. [laughing] Push and glide. - Push and glide. - You got it. [laughing] - You're so fast. - It's cool. ♪ Catching a snowflake on our tongue ♪ ♪ And it lets me know that you're the one ♪ ♪ As we fa la la la so much better ♪ ♪ When we're making merry together ♪ ♪ Let's go out and deck the halls tonight ♪ ♪ I hear the sleigh bells ring ♪ ♪ And all the joy they bring in it ♪ ♪ Oh, it makes me want to say ♪ ♪ That I fa la la la so much better ♪ ♪ When we're making merry together ♪ ♪ Let's go out and deck the halls tonight ♪ [screams] I'll be right back. You all right, buddy? - Your knee hurt? - Yeah. Okay, here, let's get you up. - Is that your dad over there? - Yeah. Okay, why don't you take a rest for a little bit. Brandon! Oh! [groaning] Oh, man. Okay. Does anything hurt besides your pride? Everything, including my pride. Are you ready to get out of here? - Yes. I've had enough fun. - All right. Let's get you up. I gotcha. Let's go check on my mom. - Doing all right? - Yeah. I wonder where your mom is. Oh... look. Look at her go. I am speechless. She's pretty brave out there. Be right back. Can I get a photo op, Miss Edwin? Oh, what are you doing? Hard evidence. Well, at least I tried. Mom, that was amazing. - Nothing to it. - Right. Ohh! It is not that funny. - Yes, it is. - Oh, stop! Nah, you did great. Wow. Would you look at that. Oh, wow. Wow. I'm impressed. I've laced up once or twice. I'm just a bit rusty, that's all. Not too much. So do you have any big plans for Christmas Eve? Uh... I'm kinda booked up. Ah. Christmas Day? Most of it. There's just a lot going on, you know? Well, sure. Me too. I-I was... I was just wondering. But if anything changes, maybe I can give you a call. Yeah. If you want. I mean, you have my number. Okay, great. This was fun. Yeah. Thank you, by the way, for... Oh, no problem. I'll... I'll see you. Yeah. Thank you. Well, are you ready? What's wrong, Sara? Nothing. I just... I just thought he really liked me. Well, he seemed very interested. I know. I... I wanted to invite him over for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, but he said he was too busy. Maybe he's involved with someone else. That's what I was thinking, but he's not acting that way. Men are hard to figure out sometimes. I'm sorry, honey. Are you really sorry, or are you just saying that? I'm really sorry. Ah. Well, thanks. I guess it would've been tough to get past the fake lemonade and hot dogs anyway. There are worse things in life than fake lemonade and hot dogs. Come on. Let's go home. [laughter] EVIE: Look at her! Oh, my God! SARA: I will give her an A for effort though. When her father died, she felt that she had to grow up overnight. No more fun and games. She just became so serious so fast. But at least she still remembers how to have fun. I thought she had forgotten. - What are you two looking at? - Nothing. Mom, how was breakfast? Ah! I swear, Michelle, since I've come here, I'm convinced that you're trying to kill me. Mom! Don't say that. - I have never eaten so much. - Oh! Okay, well, that wasn't funny. Well, it was very nice, dear. I ate every bit. Good. Okay. Uh, Gran, Gran, what is this about? Sara, I always regretted your crazy childhood fear of Santa Claus. It's always made Christmas such an interesting time. The screaming and the crying. And the fainting and the shaking. That was a long time ago. And the hair-pulling and the biting. And the accidents. Enough already, okay? So I think that after all these years, I'm entitled to a nice glossy photograph of the two of you sitting on Santa's lap. Mom, no! You remember what happened last time? No! I can totally do this. I am an adult, you know. Besides, I've got much better control over those things now. Well, I hope so. Oh, good. Then it's all settled. Don't you think people will find it strange that two grown women want to have their picture taken on Santa's lap? I mean, it's a little outside their normal business. Sara, having your picture taken on Santa's lap is their normal business. Besides, it's the day before Christmas. I'm sure they'll be fine with it as long as the check clears. Oh, Michelle! Just the person I wanted to see. I know, Fran. I've been out of touch lately with the holidays and all. I'm sorry. Sara Edwin! My kids love your books. Why didn't you tell anybody she was coming home? Well, I... Would you mind signing this to my boy Tommy? - Of course not. Tommy? - Yeah. All right. "Tommy, may there always be a mouse in your house." There you go. Thank you! Well, gotta run. And shame on you, Michelle Anne Edwin, keeping your big-shot daughter all to yourself. Does that happen often? I don't know. Come on. Let's find Santa and get this over with. - Oh, God. - We have to do this. You can do this. You girls jiggy for a photo with Big Red? Did you say jiggy? Rad, right? Ugh. You read my mind. You got style, babe. Thank you. Next! Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! Come on, young lady! Take a seat on Santa's lap! Come on, it's okay! Come on. Come on over. Take a seat on Santa's lap. Come on. You might regret this. And what would you like for Christmas, young lady? [whispering] Say cheese! Okay, it's done. - Merry Christmas, Santa. - Merry Christmas to you. Next! Okay, come on! Come on, lady! Come on. - Take a load off. - What? Get up there, Mom. If I can do it, you can do it. Come on! You're holding up the whole line! Come on! There we go. There we go. Sit right here. Say cheese! Cheese! Okay, well, thank you. Wait, wait. Now, I did something for you. Perhaps you could do a little something for ol' Santa Claus. What? For the past five Christmases, your husband has asked only one thing of you, and that is a subscription to Popular Fly Fishing and Outdoor Sportsmagazine. Couldn't you get it for him.? - It's only 20 bucks. - How did you know about that? I'm Santa Claus. Okay, I will. I will. I will. Next! You both, um, look petrified. - It was a breeze. - It was... fun. Good. Thank you. Ahh! Mom, are you all right? Well, I'm kinda tired. Maybe I should just go lie down for a while. Well, here, here, let me help you. I'm so proud of both of you. It's been a perfect Christmas so far. Gran, save your breath. Need to get you to bed. I'm coming, I'm going. I'm coming and going. There you go. All set? All set. I guess we've finally come to the end of your Christmas list. - Not quite. - Really? Number 9: Give unto others. This is the day before Christmas, and we must do something charitable for the children's shelter. They could really use it. That's a snap. I'll write a check. A check? Mom, there's nothing proactive about that. It's always worked before. Not today. We are going to earn it. ♪ ♪ Okay. I'm gonna set up over here. You can set up over there by the door. That way we can catch people coming and going. All right, but I feel ridiculous. I'm too old to be running around in a skimpy outfit. Mom, you have to have a way to get people's attention. You've gotta tell 'em to sell 'em. Excuse me. Would you mind moving down about ten feet? I need this space to put my bucket down. You sure ten feet will be enough? This is for a very worthy cause. Like I'm not a very worthy cause? Oh, for goodness sake. Here. Now please move down about 10 feet. Thank you. ♪ ♪ Merry Christmas. Help the children! Merry Christmas. I don't get it. What's she got that I don't got? A shorter skirt. - [cloth tearing] - [wolf whistle] Help the children? Help the children, sir? Ah, come on. Give it all. Bless your heart. Help the children? Hey, bub, could you jazz it up a little bit? It's Christmastime. Christmastime! ♪ ♪ What's going on here? Raising money for the children's shelter. Dollar for the bucket? Great show. Merry Christmas! Well, if it isn't the Dancing Edwin Sisters. What are you doing here? Um, it's a grocery store. I shop here sometimes. So I thought you were supposed to be super busy today. I am. I just forgot a few things. Okay. Well, don't let me stop you. Okay. I'll, uh, see ya. Brandon. Yeah. Dollar for the bucket? Sure. Good work, Mom. Delivering all these gifts is gonna make us feel so good on the inside. I hope so because every inch of my outside is killing me. [laughs] - Ohh! - Whew! Oh, there you are. Hello! - Ho ho ho! - Let me give you a hand. Oh, that'd be great. Where do you want these, here? Right there, please. I couldn't believe it when you guys called out of the blue. It's just a miracle. The children haven't had much to look forward to this year. I just wish there was more we could've done. Well, believe me, it's more than most people. It's hard to imagine there are so many children with nowhere to go at Christmas. It's because these are the older kids. Most people are only interested in the babies. Can we hand these out now? We've got a five-pound roast in the oven at home, and I'm afraid it'll burn. Oh, how nice! - Mom! - Well, I didn't mean... I just meant that it is Christmas Eve. Of course. What's that smell? Uh-oh. Oh, that's the children's dinner. Hot dogs for Christmas Eve dinner? Things have been a little more difficult this year than I care to admit. Ho ho ho. All right, the cookies are done. Hot pan coming through. Oh, hey, look who it is. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot! Hello. Hey. See? I told you I had plans for Christmas. You did. I just didn't realize. Brandon donates so much of his time around here, fixing things up and helping us out, he barely has a life of his own. I don't know what we'd do without him. It's nothing, really. I couldn't have done it without this though. [clears throat] Okay, what do you say we get all these cookies and presents out to the kids before they start a riot? Dessert before dinner? Oh, come on. If your Christmas Eve dinner was hot dogs and some lemonade, wouldn't you want a cookie first? I would. [yelling] All right, who's first? Me! Me! All right. Make sure you guys get your presents. All right. - There you go! - Thank you! Here you go. One more. Ready? Catch. Thank you. And for you. Okay. - Okay. - Thank you. Oh! What? What is it, dear? Oh, excuse me. Who's next? - What? - I'm sorry, Mrs. Edwin. Katie can't speak or hear. Oh. It's okay. She was born this way. That's why her parents didn't keep her. Oh, dear God. It's all right. She's loved here. What's she saying? She wants to know if there's anything in the bag for her. Oh, you didn't get a present? No. Oh. Yes! Yes, there is! You know what? It was so small that it got lost in the bottom of the bag. Here it is. A Christmas ring just for you. Give me your hand. A little piece of yarn and it'll be perfect. Are you sure, Mrs. Edwin? Yes. Katie wants to know, is it hers to keep? Yes, dear. Forever and ever. Tell her. Tell her that this ring will always bring the wearer much happiness. Who would like to hear Miss Sara's story? Me! Could you be convinced? I could, but I think my mom would do a much better job than me. What, me? Oh, no! Vote's already in. Oh, all right. All right. A Mouse in the House for Christmas by Sara Edwin. [cheering] Okay, all right. "This story begins with a squeak." Mom, you have to hit the word "squeak" harder. Huh? The squeak! "This story begins with a squeak!" [laughter] "And is not to be told by the meek." Ahem. "And is not to be told by the meek." [laughter] "It was the cat's meow... that alerted the cow... and frightened the fish in the creek!" Who wrote this? She's pretty good. Honeys, I'm home! Just put them on the table. We'll eat in a minute. I still don't know why I'm bringing these burgers and fries home. I thought Sara was gonna make a roast. Change of plans, Dad! And I burned the roast. Oh... We'll make it up to you. I promise. I promise. All right. Suddenly I can't wait to see what's gonna happen tomorrow. Okay, here we go. Yay! Now, kids, there's no need for all this excessive cheering. Or maybe there is. What the heck? Yay! [cheering] All right, kids, let's settle down I think it's time for us to eat. This has been a really exciting time for them. I really didn't know what today was gonna be like, but I didn't think it was gonna turn out to be like this. I know I said yesterday that we wished we could've done more, but I guess all we had to do was dig a little deeper. I'm so glad we did. What you guys have done has been absolutely amazing. I would have to agree. Is my mom signing? Yeah, she is. She's not half bad either. Mom, I didn't know you could sign. Old Mrs. Higgins at the bridge club was deaf, so I had to learn sign language or I was gonna lose a partner. Comes in handy sometimes, if you know what I mean. [laughter] I'll bet your mother's just full of surprises. Oh, she certainly is. What's she saying? Well, she asked Katie if she could tell her a secret, and Katie says sure. So what's the secret? I can't tell you that. It's a secret. She's my mother. Well, all right. I guess it's not anything that you don't already know. Your mother told Katie that she's gonna be leaving soon. She told her? Poor thing. It's just breaks my heart. Well, it doesn't sound so bad to me. She said she's gonna be selling her condo, and moving into a large two-bedroom poolside suite at the country club. Country club? Poolside? Sounds pretty awesome. Awesome. [thud] Tim! [yelps] I got him the subscription! I got him the subscription! Easy, Mrs. Edwin. It's Brandon, Dr. Read. [gasps] Of course it is. What happened? You fainted, Mom. Dad and Brandon had to bring you in here. Are you okay? Yes. Yes, I'm fine. Where's your father? He's helping Miss Carrier wrangle the kids. I'll go get him. Here. Do you wanna try and sit up? Yes. Thank you. My mom's not dying. I agree. She's has a few health concerns, but all her tests were negative. I'd say she's got a few miles left on her. You sure you're okay? Yes, yes, yes, I'm fine. Okay. Well, I've got a few goodies to go pass out. You really are a remarkable young man, Brandon. All that you do for that shelter. It's really nothing. I grew up there. Honey, are you all right? Mom's not dying. What? She's not dying. She's moving into a poolside suite at the country club. Are... Are you positive? I'm positive. [laughs] Oh! All of this... Oh, I could just kill her! Well, you know, she didn't actually say she was dying. - That was our mistake. - That's true. But you know, if you really stop to think about it... It was the best Christmas of my entire life. Ho ho ho ho ho! Let's see what Santa has for you. Oh, here's one for you. Who wants the next one? Oh, let's go with you. Thank you! You're welcome. Ho ho ho ho! Miss Katie. Where did you get all these books? I had 'em stashed in the trunk of my car. That was very smart of you. Honey, do you have a pen? Oh, kids don't care about that. It's not for the kids. Here's Santa's little helper. Who wants another Mouse in the House for Christmas? Did everyone get one? One for you. - Thank you! - You're welcome. Gracias. Now, what do we say to good old Santa Claus? Thank you! But you're not Santa! What? Okay, you guys got me. But I'll have you know that I am a duly authorized agent of the big man in the North Pole himself. No, you're not! Yes, I am! And I can prove it. Prove it! Oh, bossy! Okay. Let's see. Wha... What's that, Santa? You want them to go outside right now? You want them to go out front right now? Go! Go, go, go! Come on! [kids yelling] Very nice. [yelling] ♪ It's the time of the year ♪ ♪ When the church bells ring ♪ ♪ Magic snow in the air ♪ ♪ And the children sing ♪ ♪ While Santa's filling his shiny red sleigh ♪ ♪ We're hanging mistletoe ♪ Oh, man. You've been very, very busy. Well, it's just one day a year. So how did you know that a white Christmas was the last thing on Gran's perfect Christmas list? A little mouse told me. Uh-huh. That was some list. Did it do the trick? It did. You are something else. I was gonna say the same thing about you. Oh! [yelling] So have you ever thought about moving back here? No. But I could. I guess a book could write itself from anywhere, right? You'd think so. The Mouse Who Set Up House. That's clever. I like it. Plus it's not a bad place to raise a family, I guess. Family? Don't you think we're moving a little fast? That's not what I... Did you just say "we"? Yes, I did. Okay. But no more hot dogs. Okay. No more hot dogs. Except at Christmas. For old times' sake. For old times' sake.
