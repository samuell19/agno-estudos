I just jumped into the ocean. I met a friend here and we just went crazy and we both just jumped into the ocean and there were fish and there was and, I mean something broke for me. I know, I know, oh, why do you always do that? I just want to tell you, I'm happy, I just want to tell you like, something, you're not here so I can't call you every single day because these calls cost money and I just want to tell you that I had a really big breakthrough moment.

I asked you to come and you said you couldn't come, you didn't want to come. No, no, don't give, see you do this all the time, everything everything, you gotta draw all the fucking attention to you, okay. This is my time, this is my time, I'm gonna do something special, I'm going to breakthrough. Hello. ♪ I said oh Chavo I don't believe you ♪ He said think what you like ♪ Take Pablo's son too ♪ Well that concluded my favorite night ♪ 'Cause a story like this isn't easy to find ♪ Let's have a toast to the ghost El Ganzo ♪ Let's have a toast to the ghost El Ganzo ♪ Oh let's have a toast to the ghost of El Ganzo [audience applause] - Thank you, thank you very much. - I think I might call it a night. - [Man] This next song, this is the first song that I wrote when I got here to Cobo and when I first got here I didn't have anything to write about at all, it's impossible to write a song because usually when you're writing songs, you're writing about like uh, some sort of tragedy or turmoil in your life, heartbreak or, something like that, it's really hard to write a happy song. Just finished a book, sort of, write this song about following, well the book is about following the journey of life so, this song is sort of also, just about following life's journey, it's called Loving the Journey [guitar music] - Hello. - Hmmmm, where is the other guy? - Who? - The guy, the manager? - Oh Billy, okay, just a second. - Hi. - Hello Miss Elisson. - Hi. - What can I do for you? - Look I know that you can't find my bag. - Again I apologize. - No it's fine, but while you were looking for it you didn't happen to come across a bear did you? - I'm sorry bear, like a real bear? - No, no just like a child's bear. - Like a stuffed animal. - Yeah. - I don't believe so but I can certainly check the lost and found for you. - Oh that would be great, thank you. - Excuse me. - Yeah. - We had a penguin, a sea turtle and a dolphin but no bear. - No bear. - No, I'm so sorry again. - It's fine. - Is everything okay? - Oh sure, thank you. - Okay. - Oh. - What's this I hear about a bear? - Oh, did you just hear that? - Yeah. - Okay, sometimes, when I'm all alone and I can't sleep at night, I sleep with my bear. - That's so cute. Sometimes when I can't sleep I end up drinking. - I like Tequila. - Would you drink some Tequila with me tonight? - Yeah. - [Guy] So you're married? - No. - Divorced? - Hmmm hm. What about you? - Well no, not married. - You're with someone? - Yes, and I have a partner. - How is that? - Some couples they look at each other, they just, all they do is they just look toward each other, I don't know it's kind of, I don't know vein or small minded. I like to think of it like, like when you have a partner you're sort of, you're looking out together, the both of you, you're doing this with the person that you love. Yeah you're sort of on this journey, this experience, this challenge together. And there's nothing more beautiful than that. - Tell you something kind of embarrassing. - Please. - When I went to go look for my bear tonight, I think I, unconsciously I was really hoping I'd run into you. - You want another drink? Okay. I can't satisfy him, he's always completely dissatisfied with everything that I do. I can't do anything right. If I'm a success, then I'm showing off or I'm, I don't know, if nothing is going on then it's like, why aren't you out there, why aren't you pushing yourself, where are you? When are you coming home? Or if I'm home it's like, when are you going, why are you here? And, I don't know, it's just confusing. I don't know if I'm coming or if I'm going, it's frustrating, it's like how many times do you have to fight with somebody. - Well sometimes, arguing, banter, it's a form of intimacy. - It's not like I'm just trying to have a fight, it's just that, that's just how it is, we're just two different people. - People get stuck, they get scared. - And then life happens ya know. - Being alone can. - [Guy] What was that? - You know either way you, I'm glad I ran into you. - A toast to sleeping with our bears. - To everything in the world. - Come here. - Woah. - Give me your mouth. - Are you going? - Yeah. Are you take this? - Oh sure, why don't I walk you to your room? - Okay. - This it? - No. - Is this it? Goodnight. [door knocks] Hello, who is it? - [Billy] Billy from the front desk. - Oh, hi Billy. - Good morning, do I have a surprise for you. I found your bag. - My bag. Yeah. Oh, hey. - You look different. Do you wanna come with me? - Yeah. Let me get my things. I've gone from thinking this is woman and man to man and himself and now it's, farther back again it becomes man and woman. This one's the same, it just gets up longer. [soft music] - A friend of mine told me about this place. He said just, you can find a little bit of peace, maybe to clear my head a little bit. I don't know about you but I feel like there's something here. Like a spirit or, something with people that we're here. - I like the birds. Close your eyes you can hear it. - [Guy] What do you hear? - So many different sounds of birds. - This is the kind of place that you can get lost in. Fine line between the past and the present here and you're sort of in the middle of two worlds, ya know. That's where I wanna be. [bright music] - How often do you and your boyfriend sleep together? - That's none of your business. - Why? - Because it's private. - I'm curious. - I know you're curious. - Why'd you paint your fingernails black? - You heard of Afro punk. - No. - Well I've been Afro punk before Afro punk was Afro punk. - Hmmmm. - We can get yours done. - Shit, I lost my ring. I remember laying it when we were laying down, I remember, it was kind of heavy. - In the grass, by the sculptures? - Yeah. - So maybe it's there. - What is happening to me? [speaks foreign language] I have a memory of that. This man, he makes these rings and he tells stories about them. He said that that was to kind of bring clarity to remind you to keep your bullshit aside. [slow music] - [Woman] Hello, welcome, can I help. [speaks foreign language] - I'm fine, and how are you too? - This is a beautiful store. - Thank you, welcome to my place. I have many new things, maybe we can find something you really like it. Are you looking for something specific? - I'm not really sure. - Open your eyes, open your soul and maybe something can talk to you. Things like this have owners and they're looking for a specific person. Enjoy my place, if you need my help just let me know. - Okay, thank you. - [Woman] You're welcome. - Me y'amas is Lizzy. - Lizzy, [mumbles], welcome to my place. - [Lizzy] It's a pleasure to meet you. - [Woman] I'm here okay. [soft music] - Let me tell you something about the Tequilas, did you know the difference between the white and the golden color? - Hmmm hm. - The white, this is strong shot and you have to drink with piece of lemon and salt. And the golden color, the time have more years inside the bottles and this is [mumbles] and good. Have soul. - [Lizzy] Salt? - Soul. - Soul. - Exactly. - [Lizzy] Soul exactly. - [Woman] Do you want to taste a little bit? - Okay. - Maybe you want to try on a different dress perfect for this weather and you can walking around more comfortably on the street, do you like the idea? - That would be great, thank you, yeah. - I didn't answer you before but, no, we haven't done anything in a long time. Probably like three or four months. Without someone holding you or touching you or, being with you. So I didn't mean to snap at you the way that I did. It's very lonely. Being with someone whose idea of affection is just to buy you a present and it's like I'm that little boy whose father goes away and all you want him to do is to toss a football with you and then he comes home with a toy car. All I want to do is just to be with someone, to share my life with someone and so I make these trips all over the world, searching for something that I can't find at home. By the way you look very nice. - I think I'm lonely too. - Hey, Miss Elisson, Miss Elisson, the bags I delivered actually belong to somebody else and I need to get them to them as soon as possible so if I can go to your room and get them that would be fantastic. - Really. - It's true, again I apologize but they are looking for them and it's really important that I get em to them as soon as possible. - That was not my bag? - No it wasn't your bag, I would be happy to. - Let's go. - Yes accompany, thank you.

How is your breakfast? - Sublime. - I'm so happy great, is there anything that I can get for you or do for you today? - No thank you. - [speaks foreign language] have a good day. - Billy. - Yes. - How did a gringo like you get a job working here? - Actually like you I came here on vacation and liked it so much I stayed. - Is that true? - Well kind off, I actually came here for a girl, I started out in the kitchen, she doesn't work here anymore. - How much time do I have left? - Hmmm, how much more time do you have? - When am I checking out? - Sunday, so you have three days left here at El Ganzo and we'll be so sad to see you go. Well enjoy the rest of your stay and have a great day. - Adios. - [Billy] Adios. - [Lizzy Voiceover] Adios amigo. - See you can't say that over the phone I want you to be here when you say something like that to me. No there's no reason for you to be jealous, no, no nobody's gonna touch me except for you. No, it's just gonna be a few more days and, oh my god, you're going back to her, she's nothing. Okay, she's just a person you meet in a hotel and you hangout, you have a few words and then that's it, you don't see them again. Yes, I'm all yours. I don't know she's fun but she's a little weird and she's not you. No I'll never replace you, you know that. I told you I'm sorry. I love you too baby. Okay. Okay I'll see you, I'll see you in a few days. You skyping or what? [soft music] - This you? - Does it look like me? - Hugo Thompson, yeah. - I was gonna lie. - I knew it. - It is a lie, you meet somebody that you don't know and you don't know, you're only gonna see them for a few minutes, an hour, so why put up the energy to give your full name so, I said Guy. - I'm not weird. - Who says you're weird? - You. - I never said you're weird, where'd you hear that? - I have some weird girl wandering around the hotel, yeah she's pretty weird. - You listening to me? - I found out I only had three days left here and I came to try to invite you to go somewhere with me. You've been such a kind person and I cannot tell you how much I appreciate your kindness. Your world has been a strange experience. - Well I thought I was pretty nice. - Good. - That stuff I said on the phone I was just, I was just talking, I mean you get in conversation with people and they want to know all your business and that's why I just said yeah you know, it's just some crazy lady, I didn't mean that, that's not what I meant. - Kinda crossed my mind that you had referred to me as wonderful, not weird. - Okay. - I mean that's just what I'm saying. - He doesn't know you though, he doesn't know you so I mean I can't say like, oh this is a wonderful person but then he's gonna be like, what are you doing with this person? - He's gonna get jealous of the girl. - Exactly, exactly and I'm with him, you know what I mean. - Freak at the hotel. - You're not a freak. You're not a freak, don't say that. - Oh. - Okay I was stupid, I said something stupid, I didn't mean that, okay. You're very special. I've been here for a couple of weeks now and I've had like block and I can't figure out anything that I'm doing and you're the first person that I've spoken to and that just kind of opened my mind to other things to just open my mind to the possibilities. I mean I'm not there yet but it's there, so don't say that. - You're the only person I know here you know that, it doesn't mean a whole lot, but it's important to me. Just know that you're here, okay. - It's okay, it's okay. Listen to me, don't go, don't go, listen to me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Thank you. - I'm very sorry. Thank you. [soft music in foreign language] [Hugo laughs] [Hugo whistles] Now you should soften up baby. Very nice, very nice. - That was rough, that was dastardly. - What is that? Dastardly, what is that? - It's not a real word. - Ow. - Oh. - Do you know how hard I had to look for these? - Yes I can't believe. Did you have it the whole day? - Yeah. [speaks foreign language] - Where are you going? - Walking, walking again. - Lizzy. - We'll walk to the ocean, then we can swim. - [Hugo] You're not making any sense. - Just walk with me, stay with me please. The last time she walked, we hit a deer on the side of the road. She jumped out of the truck, she walked for days, days and days, she went all the way. Tell her she finally asked for help, they checked her into a facility of some sort, concerned for her condition they said, both physical and mental. We came to pick her up, she slipped out the back door, never saw home again. She went far away, got a new home, got a new job, worked two years straight and then she got fired. I couldn't take it, I had to get away. [soft music] [bright music] Hello. - Hey, hey. - [Lizzy] Hi. - I figured it out, figured it out, come on, come on, come on. - Great, good. - What's the last thing that you remember before El Ganzo. - This room, big, empty. - What is your name? - [Lizzy] Lizzy. - Lizzy? - Elisson. - Does that not ring a bell? - What are you doing? - Last night when I came home, I turned on the TV and there was a movie on and it was you. - I think that was a long time ago. - [Hugo] When? Your story, that's what you could remember. I know who you are. Come baby just let me help you, okay, I'm here with you. Now what else do you remember, you did that movie and. [Lizzy crying] Oh oh oh, okay, alright, what's the matter, baby somebody hurt you. - I just don't remember, I don't remember anything anymore. - [Hugo] You do remember, you do remember. - I can't, I don't know what happened to me, I don't know what happened to me. I don't know what happened to me. - Sweetheart, you don't have to do this alone, okay, I'm here with you, I'm here with you okay. It's okay. You don't have to cry. - Where'd you come from? Where did you come from? - I'm right here. [door knocks] That's for you baby it's not for me. - Miss Elisson. Hello, how are you? I have the most wonderful surprise for you, I found your bag and this time it's really yours. Your taxi driver dropped it off, he said you left it with the taxi when you walked away, after the accident. - Where is he? - Antonio, the driver? - Yes. - He left, he had to go to work but he said he was so sorry that he didn't get you the bag sooner but he's vehicle was being fixed. - Can you find him for me Billy? - Off course, I'll look into it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you. - [Billy] Have a good day. - Can you come here? Okay. I left that movie with a guy I met, he was a poor person, my furniture picker. I went away with him, the guy who hit the deer. For two years, must have been a long time, I just didn't want to be with him anymore, I didn't want to be that person anymore. I told you about the walking and there was the hospital but it wasn't a long time, it was just a short time in a hospital. - You're doing okay. - Do you know how crazy this was. I read about this hotel in a magazine and look it's my bathing suit, well I wanted to come to this hotel and have a vacation I tell you, I didn't care if it was the last day of the rest of my life, if that's all I ever did again I just wanted to come here and I don't really know why I wanted to swim in the ocean and I, I don't wanna go back here. I never wanna go back here ever again. - I just wanna have a witness to my life, you know. - I do. [soft music] [bright music] Hello. Antonio right. [speaks foreign language] - Hugo, Lizzy. - Lizzy, you remember my name. [speaks foreign language] - Cheese. [Antonio laughs] Family own all this? - Yeah.
