This movie was produced to strengthen the faith... ... in anticipation of damnable heresies. Assalamu'alaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh! Wa'alaikumsalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh. Ladies and gentlemen, and all youngsters! We see this as a fact. The Lord Almighty has sent an apostle... ... during every period for all His people! Agreed? Agreed! I have received a revelation from the Lord... ... to free his people from their sins... ... by trusting my apostleship as the bearer of the word of truth. Who will satisfy all of your understanding. I am the Prophet who was promised... ... before the apocalypse comes to burn the Earth. Above the ground which used to be fertile... ... and slowly became barren. The Earth has grown hotter. The wrath of the Creator... ... because we have forgotten Him! I am the bearer of warnings. And I will change it into the bearer of good news! I am the apostle who will blow rains... ... destroy the walls of pain... ... and lay waste to sufferings. And purify all of you... ... with miracles which will satisfy your understandings. That new apostle... ... will burn all sins! I am the promised Prophet... ... before the apocalypse comes to burn the Earth! Rianti! Rianti! Mengaku Rasul, Sesat How is it, Doctor? Rianti's condition is stable. If God is willing, Rianti will recover. I hope the both of you keep praying. Okay? - Thank you, Doctor. - Thank you. Thank you, Doctor. The anarchy performed by the people of Cimaru Village... ... who have burned a home which they regarded as a home... ... for the practice of heresy... ... which is led by a man who claims to be a new apostle... ... who has received a revelation to free the sins of the people. Until this moment, there is still chaos in this area. The police has identified 34 bodies found among the rubbles... ... including many others who suffered serious injuries. Until now, the authorities are still trying to identify... ... the bodies which have yet to be found. My name is Rianti. Three days ago, I should've died. Come on, Ji. Accompany me for a while. Please. Sorry, I can't. Can't you see what I'm doing? You can do that later. Come on, Ji, please. Come on! Please! What's wrong with you? Don't be like this! No! I won't let go until you promise to take me! Are you insane? Don't be like this! - No! - Let go! Are you insane? Rianti, listen to me. Don't be like this. Listen? To what? You think I'm stupid? What you saw back there isn't what you think. She's just so flirty. Yeah, she is. Because of you. Rianti! Rianti, don't be like this. Disgusting! Cimaru Village You're just impatient. We don't know that Rianti will end up with Ajie. That's the point. From now, we have to prevent Rianti... ... from ending up with that good-for-nothing. We can't just leave that up to fate, right? What will become of our child... ... if she keeps hanging around with that pathetic guy? Tattoos. Earring studs. You're just judging him by the cover. There's no guarantee that your suspicions are justified. I really don't understand. Why did this misfortune happen to our family? Now Rianti is a follower of Teacher Samir's teachings. Only a Satan will claim himself as an apostle. Teacher Samir... ... is only a heathen who wants to pull out the roots of Muslim faith. Especially the younger generation who are still unstable. The burning of the alleged practice of heresy... ... also caused reactions from various religious leaders. Please stay tuned. Nobody has the right to claim as an apostle. This has been stressed in Quran Al Karim verse. In Al Ahzab, verse 40. Also in Prophet Muhammad's Sulullah Alaihi Wasallam hadith... ... "La Nabiya Badi." There is no more apostle after me. We also know... ... that the angel Gabriel did not give revelations... ... except to prophets and apostles... ... which has been completed by Muhammad Sulullah Alaihi Wasallam. Teacher Samir is amazing. Even an official kisses his hand. Whoever can kiss the hand of Teacher Samir... ... that's like kissing Hajar Aswad. Yeah. That means we don't have to do our hajj pilgrimage. Right? What kind of official is he? You don't know? He's the future governor. He's asking Teacher Samir to work with him. Be his... What's the name? Deputy governor. Did he use to be a celebrity? This hermitage... ... was built for people looking for guidance... ... and answers from the Lord. They who believe in the coming of the Savior... ... who will take them to heaven. No matter... ... from what tribe. Even from any religion. This hermitage... ... helps all people! As many and as wide as we can. And don't you worry. Because a teacher who is in the truth... ... is ready to be a leader. Even take the fall to save his people. So... ... no one can prevent another from being my follower! What if the one preventing is somebody whom we love? Like our parents? The one who tries to prevent... ... is an enemy of God. People like that... ... must be considered an enemy. Must be fought. Jihad! Pick up the cane. Assalamu'alaikum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh. Wa'alaikumsalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh. You shouldn't have talked like that... ...in front of the congregation. So, I'm wrong again? I'm never right in your eyes. I just don't understand. You sound like you're inciting. Make sure you don't create the wrong result. Don't lecture me. I know what I'm doing. Behave yourself. Remember. You have promised. You can't control me forever. Come on. Our time is limited. What took you so long, Teacher? There was a problem with Ki Baihaqi. Assalamu'alaikum, Ki. Wa'alaikumsalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh. Saijah? What brings you here so late? I'm looking for Samir. He didn't come to your house? Have you checked with Rembah or Yayu? Or Sundari? I've already asked them, Ki. He's not at their house. Where could he be? I actually don't want to bother you. Because I know Samir has a short temper. But this time I have no choice, Ki. Sarah is sick at home. She has a fever. - And I... - Enough. I understand. You can go home for now. I'll try to find Samir. Once I find him, I'll send him to you. - Yes. Thank you, Ki. - Yes. I'll go home now. Assalamu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumsalam Warahmatullahi. How's your sister. Still restless? She woke for a bit. She was looking for you and Dad. After that, she fell asleep again. Well? You found Dad? No. He left. But I don't know where. Dad is always like that. He's never here when he's needed. Don't complain. He'll eventually come. Assalamu'alaikum. There he is. Wa'alaikumsalam. She's sick? Do you miss me? I'm sorry. I'm too busy at the hermitage. I promise I won't neglect my children. Every time I see you during sermon... ... I lose my concentration. But how long will we keep this up, Teacher? What do you mean? I want to make our relationship official. I want to be like your other wives. Later. There will be a time for that. Please be patient. Whatever happens, I won't leave you. You should be happy. You were chosen. A relationship filled with love is lawful in the eyes of God. Where were you? You surprised me. Where were you? Must I tell you of all my doings? Sarah is sick, but you... It's taken care of, right? Nothing to worry about. God Almighty. Assalamu'alaikum Warahmatullah. Assalamu'alaikum Warahmatullah. There are so many in the Quran. Many verse which states... ... that Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam, Muhammad bin Abdullah... ... Alihalaihi Washolat Wasallam is the last prophet. Just as the Lord Almighty explained in the Quran... ... in Al Ahzab, verse 40. Bismillahirrahmanirrahim Honey... ... we can't keep letting Rianti live at that hermitage. We have tried to persuade her. But she's so stubborn. What else can we do? But once school starts, she'll come back for sure. Yes, but I feel that place is not good for Rianti. That Muhammad is not a father of a child among you. But he is an apostle, a messenger. And the Apostle is a closure for the Prophet. I have one more question, Mr Ustad. All this time, we know that heresy is followed by many people. From those with minimum education, even those with a high education. What phenomenon is actually happening, Mr Ustad? What is causing the decrease of our people's faith? Where are you going, Sir? I want to study religion. To sign up, you can go that way, Sir. Assalamu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumsalam. Yes, I'll be resting for two weeks. Once I'm refreshed, I'll work again. This is not working, this is prostituting. It's the same thing. No, it's different. So we're paying zakat from our robbery income? Zakat is not important. What's important is cleansing of sins. So, if I kill, the zakat is bigger? Well, yeah. - Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. Please sit. No need. Which study package would you like to pick? - Package? - Yes. We have levels of study here. If you want to take the regular one, this is the price. If you choose the exclusive package, this is the price. My God, look at the difference. Are you insane? Of course. In the regular package, you're just studying religion. You'll just get the knowledge. But if you pick the exclusive package, you will get the facilities. Teacher Samir will pray for you. If you die, your sins will be forgiven and you'll go to heaven for sure. Go to heaven? Yes. You'll get a certificate. We guarantee you'll go to heaven. Are you guys all crazy? Assalamu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumsalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh. Who are you? Teacher, this is a student. He'd like to sign up at our hermitage. What's his name? Ajie. Not bad. You need to listen to your parents. Our happiness... ... is our parents' creed. You don't like that I'm here? I feel at peace here. I want to study religion. You can study religion anywhere. Doesn't have to be here, right? What's the problem if I study religion here? Is it wrong? No. Doesn't matter. Of course you have to pay to study religion here, Ajie. A hermitage this big needs funding. Yeah, but... Why must you provide certificates? Why make a religion into a law object? If you have studied here,... ... you will understand the nature of that certificate. If you want... ... you can stay here and study religion. For free. Ajie? I know, you're still mad at me, right? Mother told you to come here? Yes. How come you don't mind being ordered by them? They're worried about you. And... ... me too. I'm also worried about you. How can I not be? You disappear suddenly without any word. Then your mom called and told me you're here. Of course I'm curious. I'm fine here. You don't have to worry and you don't have to live here. You might as well go home. With you, right? Don't get your hopes up. If I wanted to go home, I could've done so myself. What's wrong with you? Your dad always opposed our relationship. But it never affected you. You were just fine. But why now? I just realized. This place has poisoned your mind, right? - You... - Right? This place is insane, especially... You're not making any sense. Just go home. You are no use here. Yes, I'm no use here. But you're also no use here. What is he doing there? Teacher Samir must want to meditate. People say he often does it. Meditate? Asking for guidance from God. So all His people are safe. Why not at the mosque? Don't act like a know-it-all. You are glorified, woman. You carry the child of a new apostle. The end of the apocalypse. If God is willing, Teacher. I will do it, as His servant. Your sincerity... ... will result... ... in heaven. Insane! What? Just see for yourself. What is wrong with you? There's nothing inside. I already told you. Teacher Samir comes here to meditate. Didn't you see it? What are you two doing here? - I'm sorry, Teacher. - Do you know... ... nobody is allowed to come here without my permission. I apologize. You're unbelievable. Your actions could get us kicked out of here. That's a good thing, right? That means we can go home. This is weird, you know? I am so sure I saw a young woman in there. Why is he meditating? Why not just pray? Don't act like you know everything. - Teacher Samir knows what he's doing. - Yeah, but it's still weird. If he's weird, no one will want to be his follower. You just have a wild imagination. Okay, maybe his religion knowledge exceeds mine. But I'm sure he was going to do something perverted. Just stop talking. Your visit can make a lot of people here angry, you know? So what if they get angry? Rianti. You can't just trust everything they tell you. And you should... Stand up! He... What is he doing here? What's wrong with that? Someone as holy as him can be at two places at once. No, I don't believe that. No one can be at two places at the same time. It's impossible. Many people were given special gifts by God. Anything can happen if God is willing. Rianti. You should go home. You're just wasting time here. That child is truly impudent. I'll kick him out tomorrow. Don't be too rash. That child is still new here and he doesn't know anything. Besides, I have warned you. Don't go there too often. That will only peak someone's curiosity. Don't dictate me. But what you are doing there... ... might be dangerous for this hermitage. Sooner or later... ... someone will question everything you do there. - Before it's too late... - When will you stop babbling? You always act smarter than me. Well? Have you persuaded her? Yes. But she still doesn't want to go home. But you'll look after her? You'll stay there, right? Yes, as you wish. Thank you, Jie. I know I can count on you. Please look after Rianti. Yes. - Who is that? - Ajie. Ajie. Listen to me carefully. Because Rianti's mom has put her trust in you... ... I will also do the same. Okay, Sir. Don't ever misuse our trust. If you do that,... ... I will find you and beat the hell out of you. Crazy future in-laws. Assalammu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumsalam. I'm Reihan. Ajie. I know. Rianti often talks about you to me. Well, she never tells me anything about you. You don't have to be suspicious. She often accompanies my mom. I understand your purpose. But you must think this through before acting. Make sure... ... that your will to marry her... ... does not become a catastrophe. And can destroy all of our goals. Rianti is not a fool like your wives. Watch your mouth. What about your wife? Is she smart? Well-educated? She's the same, right? Your wife is also a stupid village girl. She was seduced by your promise about a guarantee in heaven. You want to marry her... ... to improve your image. Because of your obsession in the election. Or is it because your lust is becoming more uncontrolled? What's wrong with lust? I know what I must do. And don't ever try to prevent me to marry her. I am a future governor. I need a proper spouse. Teacher Samir has four wives? Yes. The other three wives... ... live in the village next to ours. Mom is the wife who lives here. This hermitage was once a pesantren. My dad managed it. But after he died,... ... Teacher Samir changed everything and married Mom. Until now, I still don't know the cause of my dad's death. How did he die? Back then, I was still 13. On that tree... ... my dad died from hanging. But I didn't believe that my dad committed suicide. When my dad managed this pesantren,... ... everything was right. Unlike now. You should persuade Rianti to go home. Why? This place... This hermitage... ... and Teacher Samir... ... is not what she imagined. If Rianti knows the truth,... ... she'll definitely be disappointed. - Rianti. - No! I don't believe you. You think I'll go home based on your lies? Why would I lie to you? Teacher Samir has four wives. So what? Everybody knows. The important thing is he can love and be fair with all of them. You condone polygamy? That's Teacher Samir with Mrs Sundari. One of his wives. They look happy. Then what about Reihan's mom? I'm sick of talking to you. - Rianti! - What is this? Don't fight. It's not good. All matters can be solved properly. Your chest may feel burning. But you must think with a cool head. Come, Honey. Come on. Teacher. Rianti. No, Teacher. I'm Laila. - Sir? - Yes. - This is Ki Baihaqi's cane, right? - Yes. Why is it here? Where is he? Maybe in his room. You can go check. - Assalammu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. Who are you looking for? I apologize, Teacher. I'm looking for Ki Baihaqi. I found his cane. That old man, he's gone senile. He even abandons his cane. Where is Ki Baihaqi, Teacher? I don't know. Maybe he's walking around the hermitage. But his cane is here. How can he walk around? There are two canes. You may go. Assalammu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumsalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh. Such a small matter. Don't make it into a big thing. A small matter can be a big thing. I already told you. I can handle everything. You're making light of all problems. If I'm not here... Ouch! - What are you doing, Jie? - Ouch. Sorry, I was just passing by. Sorry. I'm suspicious of Ajie. You fought again with Ajie? I got mad. He's getting even more annoying. He always persuades me to come home every day. Ajie does that because he loves you. But I don't. I don't have any more feelings towards him. Why did you come here? You come looking for trouble? To spy on us? I don't want anything. I just want to bring Rianti home. - Assalammu'alaikum, Ki. - Wa'alaikumsalam Warahmatullah. Well? Your divorce is finalized? Don't talk about that. What are you, a tabloid reporter? You're the same here. Rather than worrying about me, why don't you just help them. Right? Take this. Just go work with them. What happened to your face, Jie? Ask him! What is it, Jie? Don't pretend. What do you mean? Teacher Samir, right? The one who did this? Until my face is black and blue like this. Right? I didn't do that, Jie. I was at my wife's house last night. Sundari. If you don't believe me, just ask. Come. Come, Jie. Come, let's see a doctor. Hey, are you still sane? If you want to seem crazy, don't do it here. Yes! Are you out of your mind? Teacher Samir never committed a crime. Maybe Ajie was beaten by Satan! Listen up, you all! I'm not insane! This man has done something to me! He came to me in my dream. He beat me until I'm black and blue! Rianti, we have to leave. This place is weird! You've crossed a line. Just go! Forget it. Come on. Just rest here. I better go home to Jakarta. Not yet. Just lay down here first. I bet you don't believe me. About what? About Teacher Samir. Your stepfather. He came into my dream. He did this to me until my face is wounded. All this time... ... there are many weird stories about Dad's powers. But I also don't know how much is true. But one thing for sure... ... he's weird. Sometimes he's nice. But sometimes he's not. Mom often says... ... it's all because he needs to think of a lot of people. Marni. What's wrong with you? I see you throwing up every day. You're like a pregnant woman, Marni. Are you... Oh my God. Mom! Oh my God. What is this? What is it? Honey. - Marni... - What's wrong with Marni? Marni's pregnant. Who is it? Who did you do this with? - Who? - Calm down, Honey. - With who? - Honey! Teacher Samir, Dad. - That bastard ustad! - Honey. - Ustad Samir is a bastard! - Dad, calm down. Teacher Samir is a holy man, Dad. He's not a bastard. He promised to marry me. My sincerity regarding this pregnancy will grant me a place in heaven. Like Siti Maryam who protected the Prophet Isa Alayhi As-Salaam. - Honey! - You tramp! Control yourself, Honey! Don't deny it. I know you did it. I just want to give a lesson to that arrogant young man. You can't do that. What is this? Samir! You impregnated my daughter. You must take responsibility! Yes! You all believe this man's word? Yes! We believe him! It is impossible that I'd impregnate a man's daughter. I have four wives. If I need to, I only have to come to one of them. I don't need another woman. Teacher! Why would you say that? - You promised to marry me. - Marry you? I have enough wives. There are four! Listen, all! Do you believe them? Or me? Don't believe him! He impregnated my daughter! Don't believe him! Don't believe him! There is no way I will do an immoral thing. I am a holy man. The Lord Almighty has cleansed me of my sins. - Liar! - Marni! - Liar! - Marni! - Marni! - He impregnated me! He impregnated me! - He... - Do you all believe me or her? He impregnated my daughter! He impregnated my daughter! Get rid of him! I will prove my apostleship. Please repent. What's happening? Teacher is going to prove that he is a holy man. All prophets and apostles... ... are given the power of miracle by the Lord Almighty. The Prophet Ibrahim. His body wasn't harmed when burned by fire. The Prophet Yunus. He didn't die when a fish swallowed him. All of them can perform miracles. Like Musa who divided the sea. That is because they are holy. Because they are chosen. And now I will prove that I am innocent. Cut off my hand. If my hand does not heal,... ... then I am guilty. Come! Who dares cut off my hand! I do! - Mr Rafi! - I do! Honey! Dad! Take him inside. Dad. Dad. Where is Ajie? At home. He says he's going home tomorrow. You should be going with him. I'll stay here. There is no way Teacher Samir committed adultery. You have really been taken in by my dad's charm. Haven't you? I've often been disappointed by him. Now you all have to believe. The Lord Almighty... ... have protected me as His apostle. There is no torture for me... ... whether it be on Earth or in the afterworld. In each of Dad's sermon... ... I mean Teacher Samir,... ... he always states that he is an apostle. Even recently... ... both Teacher Samir and Ki Baihaqi... ... are seldom seen at the mosque to lead the congregaton prayers. Maybe Teacher Samir and Ki Baihaqi are followers of a heresy. They're just hiding behind Islam for their own personal goals. We have to investigate who they really are. Subahanallah walhamdulillah. Walaillahaillalahuwallohuakbar. Subahanallah walhamdulillah. Walaillahaillalahuwallahuakbar. Subahanallah walhamdulillah. Walaillahaillalahuwallahuakbar. Subahanallah walhamdulillah. Walaillahaillalahuwallahuakbar. We'll wait until it's really empty. Does your mom also attend tirakat? No, she's at home. Sarah's fever is back. That's good. - Why? - Nothing. Just in case I burn down that tirakat place. What about Rianti? Okay, come on. For those who believe... ... you are now my followers. The Lord Almighty has promised... ... to grant heaven upon you all. Just like the followers... ... prophets and apostles before me who were always wronged. I am the apostle who will guide you all... ... to the kingdom in heaven. Just like Isa who was born as a savior for mankind. I've always wanted to prevent him. Samir has lost all feelings. I gave him time to repent. But Samir brought his followers to the tirakat house. Hijrath for the perfection of faith, as he says. My God. Gather the people. I have been given a message to perfect your services. Don't be afraid. All noble actions will always be opposed. Just like previous apostles and prophets... ... who were always accused of blasphemy... ... and who were persecuted. Strengthen your hearts. Stand firm in your faith... ... to stay on the straight path. This is the house of God... ... which will protect you all who are faithful to Him. There are two kinds of lives. When we meet our death,... ... there is an immortal life. Burn it! This is the true nature of hijrath. Welcome us in your heaven, Lord. Allahu Akbar. Rianti. Rianti! Rianti! Poor Teacher Samir. Why? He died terribly. He was a good man. He often gives us fertilizers. Yeah. It's useful for us. Not to mention, the government doesn't care about farmers anymore. Fertilizers are even rarer. And their prices are unbelievable. This is a creed. Our belief. Teacher Samir's kindness to us was only a mask. So we believe that he is an apostle. But by the way, where is Ki Baihaqi? Ever since that incident, he rarely shows up. Maybe he feels ashamed because of that crazy Teacher Samir. Assalamu'alaikum. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank God, the harvest is successful. Come. We'll pray together in the hermitage. We'll give thanks to the Lord. Is it that easy to believe that someone is an apostle? Let's go back to the Quran. Think again. Is it true Samir can perform a miracle by returning from the dead? Or is it merely a magic trick, or even deception? My God. There is nothing in this world... ... that can be compared to Rasulullah Solaluhualaihiwasallam. Ustad Samir who claims himself as an apostle... ... who was sent by the Creator and received a revelation... ... to bring all the people to heaven... ... has appeared again in front of a local community... ... who claimed to have burned Ustad Samir until he died. Ustad Samir teachings are considered a heresy. He claims this incident is only a temporary hijrath... ... so the people who burned themselves will be free of the fires of hell. The truth is the Lord Almighty... Breaking News, Teacher Samir Rises Again ... has sent someone to shed light among His people. I have died... ... and was resurrected again with the highest level. So whoever... ... doesn't admit my apostleship... ... a heathen! Decapitate them! Rianti. We were given minds to think. Given eyes to see. - Correct? - Correct. So now you cannot question my apostleship. The Lord Almighty... ... has shown His power... ... by raising me from the dead. In the name of the Lord. Assalamu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumsalam warohmatullohi wabarokatuh. Thank God you came back, Rianti. If God is willing... ... you can also feel the perfection of the hijrath nature. Your mandate... ... regarding the burning which was done by the villagers... ... has been delivered. It's safe. They were wrong. If God is willing, they will see the light. Let's hope they will realize the truth. Come. One more thing, Teacher. We now receive a lot of support from the community. - Thank God. - If God is willing,... ... we will win the election. Amen. I saw Teacher Samir's resurrection on TV yesterday. Then I was picked up. My instinct guided me back here. For what? To study religion. Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. - Wa'alaikumsalam. Rianti. You're back. Yes. Reihan. I need to speak to Rianti. Just the two of us. Okay. - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. God is everywhere. We can pray anywhere. Even give ourselves to Him. That is why, tomorrow... ... our mosque which is old, narrow and stuffy... ... we will tear it down. This stupidity... ... has been going on for centuries. The Lord Almighty is in every direction. Why must we pray facing the Qibla? The point is a religion which leads to heaven... ... doesn't complicate its followers... ... but gives convenience to them. Do you want... ... to take a raft to heaven? Insane! Insane! I don't understand what goes on in Rianti's mind. She abandoned me to marry that perverted Ustad. I might as well kill him. We have to take Rianti away from here. If she has decided to marry Teacher Samir,... ... that means there is no hope for me. Why should I take her away from here... ... if one day she'll just come back here? Calm down, Jie. No matter what... ... I will never let that marriage happen. Because Mom will be more hurt. I will never be hurt. If that is God's will,... ... I will accept it. Your dad just divorced Sundari. God's will? This is not God's will. This is Satan's will. Teacher Samir is just toying with religion... ... with his satanic knowledge. He's willing to marry any woman. Who knows who else he will marry after Rianti? It's possible he might even marry his own daughter. Sarah! Sarah? Sarah is not Teacher Samir's daughter. Teacher Samir married me... ... when I was one month pregnant. After Reihan's dad and Sarah,... ... the heir of this pesantren... ... died. The guardian of a bride in a marriage... ... is only for the wedding of normal folk like you all. But not for an apostle like me. I am permitted to conduct a marriage ceremony... ... for myself. I am also waiting for a message... ... so one day, you all can conduct a wedding like me. Teacher Samir... ... continued his obsession for wealth and power... ... until this place changed... ... far from the truth. Teacher Samir married me... ... so he can easily rule over this place. So he can easily destroy the harmony and creed of Islam. There are two personalities when Teacher Samir is with me. Sometimes he treats me so gently. But sometimes he treats me like an animal. For Teacher Samir... ... women are only a satisfaction for lust. Even girls who are not mature yet also become his victims. By hiding behind religion,... ... Teacher Samir and Ki Baihaqi... ... achieve anything they want. Teacher Samir and Ki Baihaqi are Teacher Samir. They are two different people, even though they are the same. Ki Baihaqi is Teacher Samir's twin. Always sacrificing for Teacher Samir. By using many reasons... ... which only God knows. Samir is barbaric. He even sacrificed his own twin. Samir! Rianti may be only one of many Muslim women... ... who is sensitive. In silence, her heart is struggling. Rianti. Allohumasolialamuhammad. Forgive me. I should have stopped him a long time ago. My name is Rianti. Three days ago, I should've died. Thank God... ... I'm still given the gift of life. To stop the damages... ... caused by a Satan in a human form... ... who claims himself as an apostle. Samir and Baihaqi were proven to be fake apostles... ... who preached heresy. God has repeatedly warned us in His Quran. During the end of times... ... many more people will claim themselves as apostles. To manage this phenomenon, do not resort to anarchy. But strengthen your faith and the creed of Islam. Mengaku Rasul, 15 Seconds Promo, Version 1, StarVision, 24 May 2008 Samir, you impregnated my daughter. You must take responsibility! I have four wives. If I need to... ... I only have to come to one of them.
