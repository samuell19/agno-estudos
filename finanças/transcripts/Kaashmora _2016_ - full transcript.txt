~By Zeus~ The dove is dead. The scriptures regarding Nava Kaaliga Pournami is missing. A pure flame can never be easily put off by evil wind! The omens are not in our favour highness! The third full moon day is the Nava Kaaliga Pournami. It's been 700 years. The place of Vikranthaka.. kingdom still remains a graveyard! The blood shed many years ago... ... Is still afresh after seven generations. Seven centuries... 8400 full moon nights... Immeasurable cravings to break free... All of it was for the Nava Kaaliga Pournami! Kaashmora will deliver me from my curse! If only that soul is delivered from the curse... It is scary to even think of it! The destiny of seven rebirths... ... And penance... ... Will transform into the arrow that destroys the evil. Every bow needs the right arrow. Kaashmora Where are you Kaashmora! Fetch the plantain leaf Swami... Dad Dad... Dad... Daddy !!! Get away fast! Run now! What happened? Please check what happened! Some relative from your mother's family had done voodoo magic on you. All this is because of the unsatisfied spirit The voodoo idol has been burnt I have identified about it and have destroyed it. It needs to be dissolved in the sea. But it still has life. I will take care of it. Swami I hope there will not be any more troubles. No evil force will come near this house, even if you want it! Ok. Let's go. Bro I am following my fiance without her knowledge. So please do not disturb me. Bye! Why are these people coming out like this? Oh my god! The bride is roaming in the graveyard! They said that she was working in a bank. Some guy who has got a loan must have died! Perfect Hi sir! You asked for half brandy. I've got it as two quarters. What is this! She is supplying drinks and side dish to the graveyard scavenger! Water? I've got a whole bottle for you. What did I ask for? I asked for Water sachet! If I spray the water packet in the drink, it will just bubble up... Only then the mixing will be proper. You spoiled everything! Get the cash from her and get the water sachet. I do not have change... Tell me. As I had informed you... I want to see ghosts. Have you seen ghosts before? Not at all! - I went to Kilpauk graveyard... - Oh yeah! Mani... I went to the Besant Nagar graveyard as well .. Oh yeah... Shankar... They talked a lot No one showed me any ghost. So you've been roaming around graveyards in search of ghosts. What is the difference between a spirit and a ghost? A ghost is a ghost and a spirit is a spirit. If it is a natural death, then it is a spirit If it is an unnatural death, then it is a ghost. It's just like a half boiled egg and an omelet. It's in the making! Hope you wont be scared looking at a ghost. Hope you will not become epileptic! Look to your left... left... Look to you left... not right... Tell me properly .. where is it? You want a water sachet again! You bloody fraud! I will make a police complaint... What sort of a daughter do you have! She is roaming around in graveyards. How will a girl go to a graveyard? Is she working in a bank or is she an undertaker? Please hear me out first. Please. Are you happy now? The entire grooms family is furious and have called off the wedding! Did not I inform you that I'll not marry until I complete my thesis? What can I do if you fix someone for me? I will first see the ghost and then see my groom! I will only have to die and show up as a ghost! It is not very easy to become a ghost. It should be an unnatural death. Must get hit by a trailer ... The body must get entangled on the bumper... ... And should travel with the trailer for a while and then die. It's better to die like this than to search a groom for you! Thanks dad. It's not that dear... Get married fast... You and your husband can then work on finding ghosts together... Or else both of you can make a wild brat as a kid! Your thesis will end with that! I will give you six months time. Finish off with all these things. Or else... I will kill you! You will then become a ghost! At this rate you will neither complete your thesis nor will you get married. Listen to me. There is a person named Kaashmora. Famous exorcist and ghost specialist. He is busy with exorcism and other ghost related works. Every night at 11 there is a show about him on TV. Oh yes! With that bubbly lady... That's the 10pm show... about marriage and sex life. What I am talking about is 'Meet the spirit' show. Recently one of his programs has got the highest hits in YouTube. Greetings sir! What is Kaashmora? It is a very peculiar name. It means the art of dealing with ghosts. Only those who know this art can control any ghost. My father knew that I was gifted with this art when I was born... ... And named me as Kaashmora. This side of the arena is filled with people who believe in ghosts and spirits. People who do not believe in it and think this as fraud is on this side. Let's start with these people. If any of you have had any direct interactions with spirits please do tell us about it. Over the last few days in our terrace... at 7.30am on every saturday... ... A crow would come and keep crying. I did not bother about it initially... It was only I later I realised that it was the place where my grandpa used to read newspaper! I would never miss any saturday after that. I will keep a newspaper and a glass of water at 7.30 The crow would drink the water and leave. Only then did we realise... Our grandpa never left us... His spirit is still in touch with us. Stop crying! Saturday at 7.30? Does a crow know any time? What is your name brother? Sekar The crow does not know any time... His grandpa knows! Spiritual people like you always choose saffron or black attire... Only the cops come in a uniform, these frauds can come in any attire. These are not spiritual people. They are cheaters. Please relax. Science has gone beyond our imagination. Are you fooling us with ghosts and spirits and exorcism? This is sheerly because of illiteracy. Just because you do not know, it does not mean that it does not exist. We have learnt that there are nine planets. Now they say that there is another tenth one. Can you confirm that there is no eleventh one? If only those that can be proved is science, can you show me the equator and the poverty line? You... Answer me! There is no point in blaming our people. Having seen only fake people around... They will have their own doubts in trusting a genuine guy. Hello .. Do you know what it means to be genuine? Two volunteers from those who do not believe in ghosts please come on to the stage. Let's see what he does. Can I have two tables please? Aged people and children who are watching this program... ... Please switch off the TV and sleep. You will get an oscar! Do you have any heart problems? I do not have a heart. Is that fine? Good! Please lie down boldly. You can just ask us to lie down. What do you mean by 'boldly'? Trying to play a mind game is it? Lie down .. Let's see what happens. People who trust... Four volunteers from the side of people who trust in spirits. Can you just sit down? Can not I do at least this for my grandpa? Do not you think something is wrong when he not choosing equal people from both sides? Two of you hold their hands and two hold their legs. Are you going to massage? Why are you covering us with a bed sheet? - For your good. - What do you mean? This looks like cheating. Please take it off! Take it off! Take it! Why did you fall off? We are one. He trusted and so I trusted. - We are close friends. - Hey friend. Lie down! All cameras point to the center point of the body. Point it here. Get... Set... Pull... What did you do to me? Why did you tear him apart! Please! Sorry! It was a mistake. Please join me! Relax. I can not join you if you keep talking. Two volunteers from those who do not trust in ghost... We can join him. Please. Somebody help. People who trust... Please call the spirit and join me! At least cameraman ?? Please sir .. There is no one here sir... Sir .. I am not married yet! Please sir! If I can tear you apart, will not I know to join you? Here a jumpscare! There a jumpscare! Mischievous guy he is! Here a jumpscare! There a jumpscare! Mischievous guy he is! Ka Ka Ki Ki Koo Koo Koo This is our Hitchcock! His fame grows everyday with Twitter trending hashtags! Are you good? Are you bad? He will not ask for anything But he will take everything! Is this the true face or is there a mask? It does not even matter! Every human has two faces! Even after a thousand teachings There exist a million fools To fear is to be stupid But fear confuses the wise! Are you good? Or are you bad? He will not ask for anything But he will take everything! A wise man with a knife Killed the animals for food. If one kills righteousness, justice and truth He is a wise criminal. Those who are caught are a few! Those who are not caught are powerful. He can auction the clothes of Eve! He has even got the contact number of Silk Smitha's spirit! Run! Run! Run! Keep running! Are you good? Or are you bad? Are you good? Or are you bad? Shall I wake him up? He is sleeping not knowing that you are here. He sleeps like a child. There is no higher sin than waking someone from their sleep. Chief! I would've come and met you if you had sent for me. Swami! We have arrived at the time that you had informed. But he was in deep sleep. That's why it got delayed a bit. Where are you now? In his bedroom. It is good for us if the bedroom is on the south side. Is there a bedroom on the south side? We have now got him to the south side. Rajesh's star is Moolam. Kedhu is in the third place. Our's is Rahu. We are at the sixth place. Hence please do not use any weapons made of metals. Non metallic.... I am sorry! Please spare me chief! No one does anything without their own knowledge! Am I doing this now without my own knowledge? To break trust is the worst sin! But there is no punishment for it in any country. Do you know why? Because people who cheat us need to be punished by ourselves. That euphoria is different! Why do you have a 'Beware of ghosts' board just like 'Beware of dogs'? The boards are placed according to what they have in their houses. - Why are you cooking stories - This is no story! It is history All evil things would ward off if my husband just glanced at them. Once they got him possessed with two evil spirits. He got to whack them immediately! From then on they've been guarding the house loyally! Go on. Please make sure you do not disturb them. Disturb who? They will not do anything. Just be bold. Granny! Be bold and go ahead dear. I am here. Daphie! Sit down! I said sit down Daphie! Daphie darling! Relax! Rs.5000 to speak to spirits For other language services, its Rs.10000 No no! I am from the bank. Need to discuss with Mr. Kaashmora. Oh is it! Daphie! Give a shake hand. Come on! Come on! She is scared is it! Why do you take so long to feed blood to them? They are very hungry! It's a little late as I was doing some rituals. Can not they bear for a while? You all have spoilt them! Mom will take care of them. You please come. They became excited as it is fresh blood. What is special about this place? Egg and milk is the specialty here. Please do not mob near the hundi. Please be careful. With more milk, you will get more prosperity and the blessings of the spirits. As you break open the eggs, your worries will fade and prosperity will blossom. I have no religion. I am omnipotent and omnipresent. People who have paid advance for the divine prophecy please stay calm. Once I get the consent from the spirits I will call you all. It is not just enough to pray at the hundi. Please be careful. To your eyes it is just a hundi. To me it is the mouth of the downtrodden! Please take a look dear! Every penny that you drop transforms as the food that feeds the downtrodden. Please satisfy the hunger of at least two children. I should've said ten children. God bless you! Next! Excuse me please! Please do not make haste. Follow the queue. Are not the foreigners waiting? I am from the bank... Bank? You come first. You please go. Have you brought money? No sir! Kaashmora has opened an account. Is not there cash in the account? No sir! I've brought the passbook, ATM card, Cheque book. You can give money based on the cheque book is not it? No sir! All these needs to be handed over to Kaashmora. You do not seem to budge at all! Trusting you I sent the foreigner away. - Where is she ?? - Sir - Its regarding my thesis... - Jesus ?? Are you a christian? You will have the blessings of Mother Mary always! It's not Jesus. It's thesis. Thesis means research I am researching on spirits and ghosts. Whoever I meet regarding this are fraudsters. They are cheaters who make a business in the name of god and spirits. They should be slippered... Sorry sir! You please do not mistake. Whoever I've seen are like that. When I decided to stop my thesis... ... I happened to see Kaashmora's show. I then decided that I should work with him. Did not you keep food for the crows today? I forgot. You see .. Grandpa is angry Go and get the food ready for the crows. You were saying something. I will not disturb you all in any ways. You will never feel that am here. I will sit in a corner and shoot all the proceedings in my camera. You will shoot in a camera? And then? Will you sell them off to TV channels? Ever since the cameras and electric drums found a place inside the temple... ... All the gods have left the temple since then! Such things can not happen in our temple. You may leave. I will not use my camera then. If you help me with my thesis I will donate 2 lakhs for the orphans. What is this? You have melted my heart in the name of orphans. Will you give an advance? No sir. All after joining Kaashmora sir only. Dad. Who is it? Please come. What do you want? You opened an account in the bank. I thought of handing you the kit pack my self. You may leave. - She wants to join as an assistant to you. - Yes sir. Please sir. Is this an institute? Out. You come tomorrow. No need to come even day after. Please leave. What he says is final. Please leave. Come day after tomorrow. It is 2 lakhs! The most sensational murder case of Realtor Rajesh and his family is being transferred to the CBI. Rajesh case is transferred the CBI. So what? As long as I am here, you will not have any troubles. All this FBI and CBI are... ... Small hindrances in your political career. As the Rahu looks at the moon from the third place... ... Its like an eclipse .. There will be small hindrances. You are like the phoenix that comes out of the ash. Take care and do not worry. I shall leave now swami. Based on the intellect of Sigmund Freud and other such personalities my brother Kaashmora has found a new... I tried talking to Kaashmora and he does not budge. If you can give me the account number I will deposit the cash. You always have the blessings of the downtrodden. Come by 4 tomorrow. I will discuss with him about your thesis. - Dear Amala - Dad. If you tell her the account number she will deposit it seems. Help her out. 50100005965721, IFSC: 0024 What are you doing? Your father told me to come at 4. I did not ask if it was in A.M or P.M. That's why I came at 4 in the morning. Are you an idiot? Is this a bank? To employ you and pay you? I do not need any pay sir. You will never feel my presence. Just like the spirits. You will never find me. Who told you that the spirits are not visible to my eyes? Super sir! This is why I wanted to join you. Only you can help me out in completing the thesis. Please sir. title of your thesis What is the? Spirits and its allied services. Fine. Come tomorrow and we'll see. What is this? Spirits... ... And the fraudulence and business allied to it. How is it? The entire family is apt for this title. Just because a few are frauds in this, you have the perception that everyone is a fraud. That is wrong. If people are following him then there is something about his power. All that is mass hypnotism. Mental conditioning. Its a few months of training. Do you remember that David Copperfield made the Statue of Liberty to vanish? Do you think it is true? So spirits and ghosts are false? Is it a big fat lie? I am not debating if it is a lie or fact. But my thesis is to prove that people who claim to be exorcists and communicators with spirits are fake. I am going to prove that this is a big business idea. So will you find out if Kaashmora is fraud or not? What is the necessity to find out? He is definitely a fraud. I am going to prove it with evidence. That is all. Bhai... We were doing exorcism here. Now it is like this. Why are you staring? Is not it true? This place was once filled with swarms of people. Now it looks like a funeral. From where did that Kaashmora spring up? He used to have biriyani from us for every Ramzan and Bakrid. He is now chasing us away from business. You need to do something about this bhai. At this rate we will have to just go around the shops with the benzoin resin smoke! How do we go to Kaashmora swami's house? Oh my god! There is so much of works underground is it! Wait and watch what I do to you! Bhai - Are you fine? - Call your son Who? Kaashmora? He must be meditating now. Dad. Switch on the motor. There is no water in the toilet. Is this how you meditate? It's not in the place. The heart needs to be clean. Stop fooling around with me. I know where the milk and the eggs are going. The egg goes to the Lord of snakes Nagaraja. Milk goes to Yogaraja. Yeah right! Why are your pictures on the tea and food stalls outside? People have kept it out of love and for good signs. With the face of a fraudster, you think you are a laughing buddha! Why are you so hot in the morning? Are you sick? I am fine. I am healthy enough to trash ten people at a time. Sorry bhai! That was not intentional. It's my fate that my business is not doing well. Bhai... Just put a nail on that tree and we will do some special rituals for you. You sloppy business will then stand tall and erect! You are always known for this! Fine. Am asking you. What is the matter? This is a town where every man lives in harmony without any religious issues. Will not you tell the matter without bashing around? Where are you taking me? Let me tell you the issue Hindus will come to you... Muslims will come to me... - Christians will go to .. What is that guy's name? - Micheal Christians will go to Micheal for exorcism. Now everyone seem to be coming only to you. Even though we are fraudsters... Bhai... Fraudsters as in? Are you a fraudster bhai? Am I a fraudster? Did you all throw away your conscience? Look there. You all are washing the snake pit! Why do keep looking around and question like kids? Its getting late for my TV show. This is what I am saying. You act too well on TV. - I am not able to act. - Leave it bhai. You made use of this opportunity and employed a few people. You seem to split bodies and walk in the air... How does this come under exorcism? This is magic. People who do not know this... ... Just shower all their money on you. Everyone needs to do business here. Stop your TV stunts right now .. or else... What if I do not? I am an old man. Spare me. - Why do not you tell him - He is an old man. This area inspector Khan Sahib is my brother in law. If I lodge a complaint with him, the entire family will be behind bars. You first get out. Send your brother in law as well. I will bless him. You guys have sent me on to the streets. So you all dare me is it? I will put an end to your gimmicks. The cops will be around your house tomorrow. I will not spare a single one of you. Only then you will know who I am. The devotees have already arrived. If I start the collection now, only then by evening I will have a lump sum amount. Hey Kaashmora! Looks like bhai has informed the cops. Hide everything. Especially the snake pit. Kaashmora? Sir! I do not have any relation with this house. I came to sell sarees. This is Samudrika silk. The one that Trisha used. Dad where are you going? She is a playful child and calls everyone daddy! You please go in. AC asked you to come to the station. Ill finish you off and no one will ever know about it. Spare him sir. He might die! Are you lying to a cop! - Thrash him! - I'll take care sir Please spare him sir. If you commit mistakes, they will thrash. Please go in. Whatever I heard is true is it? What did you hear sir? You seem to be doing some TV program? A big hit it seems. They also said that the TRP ratings were rocketing. That's their program. What's in our hands sir? Please sit down. You show some gimmicks it seems. Be careful. Someone has said wrongly about me. It's not gimmicks. There are few techniques to reach the waves, frequencies and vibrations of spirits. We communicate with the spirits with these techniques. There is nothing that the mind can not fathom if we concentrate hard on it. No ordinary man will understand this. People like you will understand. This was not taught even in the famous Nalanda university. That's why to make this as part of the curriculum... ..the entire family is working towards it. I am satisfied. Nothing much The car parked outside the station is missing. Can you please find it out for me? Please! Is it your vehicle? Departments vehicle. Its a shame if people know about it. I've checked on the local thieves. But it is of no use. Please help What is this sir? You have latest technology with GPS and all .. You are saying that you are not able to find your own vehicle. I still can not believe! Come on! They were searching the Malaysian flight for months! This is just a car. There is a CM meeting in two days. It is an embarrassment if people get to know this. Please check and tell me. We can not check it here. Ask what you want and it will be arranged here. What am I going to ask? I need to meditate to Prathyangara Devi and connect with the spirits. We can not be doing it in any place. You know what kind of a place a police station is. - The spirits will never come here. - Then? Please come home. We'll check for it today and sort it out by morning. Please bring 2 litres of milk and 6 eggs when you come. - I take leave - Brother. Are the eggs enough or do you need any onions, chillies etc? Are we going to booze? - How can you ask all this to swami? - Sorry! I'll be communicating with the spirits. The milk and eggs are to be offered at the snake pit. Then... Please ensure that the matter is between us. The secret in me is like the milk poured in the pit. It will never go out. Sir You need not break the egg. You can drop it as it is. The snake will eat when it is hungry. Fine Drop it sir. Do you understand? The border where two languages unite Oh my! Is it Pakistan border? The vehicle has reached the hands of the terrorists? It starts with Ta and ends with Da Is it Thailand? There are no places that starts and ends with those letters. Is it... Kaki Nada? Ka Da? Tada Wow! A long tar road like a long black python! And your vehicle stands like saffron! An NTR statue stands beside it. Hey - Go and check about it. - Fine sir. Everything is ready Go on! Good morning sir! I am... Inspector Rajalingam from Chennai. If the vehicle crosses the border... ... Is not it an issue? Borders apply only to you Not for these spirits which are free to roam! Sir! - The vehicle is there it seems - What are you saying! How does he know ?? No mortal soul can touch it! It seems they can not touch the vehicle. Whoever it is ask them to stay away from the vehicle. Move away! Move away! The vehicle has started it seems. The vehicle is moving it seems. - The vehicle is moving. - Of course it is moving! - The vehicle has reached the station it seems - What !! My lord! I never trusted when you told about spirits. With the help of spirits, the vehicle from there... ... To the place where it was lost... I am mesmerized !! Please do not get over ecstatic... If you can stand on the north side... North side... Where ever you stand is north, my lord! Bless us my lord! You too please stand. No sir! A dutiful officer like you must not prostrate at the feet of spiritual people like us. A temple needs to be worshipped. Spiritual people like you should be worshipped at your feet! Wait. What is this! You were saying wrong things about them! Here the AC is prostrating at this feet! My lord! Can you also tell us who stole the vehicle? The spirits will take care of them. You must never worry about that. It would not be good if I do not prostrate when he does. Madam .. The cars are ready. We can send one to the police station and the other to Tada. Our Innova is at our station. In the murder case of Realtor Rajesh and his family... ... The accused minister Dhanakodi, maintains silence to the questions of the press - If we need to talk about this... - Did you check the papers today? You said you would handle even the FBI You asked me to be silent with the press. He has written things according to his fancies. All the calculations were right. But I do not know why these things are happening. Oh my! The rope used to hang Rajesh... Is not it yellow? You seem to ask if it is yellow or green now? Mind your tongue with the guru It's ok dear. There is a way out of this. Everything will be under our control once we finish the rituals. Can anything be done to you? Even if you are on fire... It's better I burn into ashes. Shall I call the other priest? Who? The one whom I had informed you about... The one who showed some gimmicks on TV. I am not able to trust anyone. Go now! Who is it? - The man named Kaashmora who appears on TV... - Our Kaashmora swami... I know Kaashmora very well. He will rock! We can trust him. Once you see him... You will never let go off him. I have seen you! I have worshipped! Enough! I feel as though I have been blessed by all the nine planets! Swami! Can I take a selfie with you? I want to tweet it. Please go ahead. I do not understand anything. Swami, please put your hands around me. Please smile swami! Go now. Swami, just a moment. I had informed high things about you. You seem to be tweeting! Please meet the minister. Please forgive me! I forgot everything when I saw Swami! Please tell me. Nothing much. Off late, there is some disturbance both in the house and out as well. There is some or the other problem with everything! I can not believe. No evil force can near the place where Swami is. Please forgive me. It is not respectful if I do something in the presence of Swami. I am just the priest He is the shrine You must first worship him and then me. Fine. I'll see you. I take leave, Swami! It exists A problem exists here Today is Pooradam When is Uthradam? On Wednesday Shall I inform them? Do it efficiently for us. Just two more days. We can take it out. If he is planning to take it out in two days... ..it means he is going to plant something in two days. No one must sleep henceforth Let's see how is planting something against us. Will he take it out? He can take it only if he planted, is not it? Where is he running to? Is he not having enough signal? Is the spirit sending him signals? Sulaiman Seth How are you? What's up? Who is it? Where? Trident? What trident? What is he doing? He is talking to some hindi speaking spirit. Trident. The trident. The trident is trapped inside a circle? That is wrong! Wrong? Vehicle Vehicle He is talking about the Benz That vehicle! Vehicle !!! Let him describe any car! But... How is it without our knowledge? Have placed it. White Mercedes... ..with the registration number as 555 Oh my! All the Benz cars here are white !! All the cars have the same registration number! I informed you guys to trap the Swami. But you all have trapped me! Seth! What is this? I can not hear you properly! TN 20 is Tiruvallur... Might not be this. TN 11 is Tambaram... Not this one too. It must be this one. Idiots! Can I find it out with Inky Pinky Ponky !! Spare me for a while to think. Is he hiding or has he ran away? Kaashmora... You have to save yourself! Seth! No problem You think and tell me properly. Our names should not be at stake. Are you confident? Who are you to dictate to me? You want to tell me? Go ahead. Tell me. Am listening. Tell me fast. Do you know of his powers? I am confident on you. Please check Swami's car. Go ahead. Seth! You too go and check. If anything goes wrong... If it does... Oh that car is it! Missed by a whisker, Kashmora! If it does... If it does... Is it done? Is it done? Yes sir. It is here. The voodoo idol needs to be burnt. Dissolve the ash in the sea. Go .. Go .. Why was it in Swami's car? Can the tree exist if the main root is destroyed? Swami is like the main root of this house. That's why they have placed it in his vehicle. How did they do it without Swami's knowledge? We never notice our shadow in the noon sun! It is great for Swami to be walking around at this age of rest. Beyond that.... Swami... He did not plant things after coming here. He planted and then he came here! Hello The judgment has come. You are acquitted from the Rajesh murder case. Gimmicks are his forte Oratory is another! He attracts the crowd massively! His meaningless talking has a million ears to listen! He makes you follow him You follow him without a reason! We can take a picture with Kaashmora swami when he is making the guinness record. Before the thousand spirits are awakened let's leave that place. Let's not leave immediately. Once he sends away the spirits we will leave. Fine. Only then we will get some good coverage. The news should be such that we are the reason for Kaashmora's growth. Sure it will! In the Guinness record of Kaashmora, my picture must be there. It sure will. Forget the ancestors teachings Follow them like sheeps! The knowings are little The understandings are even little Greeds and Wants leads to destruction! Crowds throng to pray Fools bribe and pray It is no shop to get what you want! Egambaram. A thousand spirits are going to be here at a time. Greetings! Greetings! - I am Guntur Chalapathi Rao - Good I have a big house near Tada. Oh you have is it! It's filled with 'Deiyam' Deiyam means? Ghosts. Deiyam means Ghost in Telugu. We have the telugu rights as well. Kaashmora swami... If you can come there once... I do not have time. I am sending a 1000 spirits to their world for Guinness record. A thousand spirits? There are 110 telugu spirits as well. So I am very busy. It's difficult for me to come. I'll send my sister. She will take care of it. Please do not say that. I've meet every possible person to solve this. All of them are frauds. - Why? - There has been no effect in their work. If you can grace us with your presence... I can pay you how much ever you want. You will insist even if we neglect. He would probably get the house registered in his name! Please give the address. I will come. We can do it efficiently. Please take me also to that house. Impossible. Tell me chief! You are giving me a lot of headaches. I got you out of Rajesh's murder case few days back. Now this one again? What is the nexus between you and opposition leader Suresh? Nothing chief! - Then why are they raiding both your houses? - Raid? Do not have anything in your house. You would have hidden something untraceable, is not it? Move them out first. Are you safe with the agreement documents between the coalition parties? Yes chief. As usual, in Swami's place, is not it? Henceforth Kaashmora is the Swami! Keep it with him. Swami! The minister has sent his men. - Is it? - Yes Ask them to come. Please come. What is the matter? The minister is going for an important land finalization. Is it agricultural land? There are some special rituals that need to be done for this. He has sent the real estate documents. Please have them here for a day and do some rituals. The minister will get it from you tomorrow. Please come to the other side with the documents bag. I will come there. Please come. - Keep it here. - Place it there. After the rituals, I will keep all of it in the locker. Would you like to have a duplicate key? No thanks. Chief just asked to give it here. Good. I take leave. Sir! Kaashmora is fraudster. Please do not trust him anymore. Chalapathi Rao said it is big house... but this appears to be a palace! Got this footage during my investigation of a theft case. On 20th the voodoo idol in this house has been removed. But on 17th these people had planted it there. His conversations with the spirits are all fake. Just now I had given him my everything. Diamonds, gold, money along with the agreement with the coalition parties. It is all worth 500 crores! Oh my! To him! You were all praises for him till yesterday and now you call him a fraudster. What will I do? Do not hand over those bags. Please bring it back. We have already handed over. What happened chief? Say something and get it back immediately. - All of it? - Yes. Chief the house is locked. - You all handed it just now, is not it? - Yes chief. Is there an issue? Please fill the tank. God bless you. Please give me your phone. - Swami I have low balance. - Its ok. Please fill the tank. - Kaashmora. It's dad here. - Tell me. Minister Dhanakodi does not seem to be a good guy. Why? For the land rituals he handed over a few bags at our temple. One of the bag was fancy and hence I opened it after he left. What do you think would've been there inside? Its all gold, money and diamonds all worth almost 300-400 crores. What are you saying? Along with these there are some useless documents as well. So the 400 crores is in our house? How will it be in our house? I've looted all of it and left the place. Oh my dad! We are on the highway We will have ambur biriyani on our way to your uncle's ashram in Bangalore. You come directly. We will get passports from there and go to some foreign country. People of this place seem to trust anything and everything. It is very boring. Let's do our works in a foreign country. It is only now that I am proud of you! Be careful. Take care of the money. The bag should be in the house. We will break open. That's of no use. The bag is en-route to bangalore. - En-route to Bangalore? - Yes All the bags are fixed with GPS tracking unit. It shows that it is en-route to bangalore. Looks like the entire family is fleeing to bangalore with the bag. Chief None of them in the family should be alive. Fine. Kaashmora Please wait. Your work is not done yet. Why do you leave so fast? Who are you? They said no one was here. Who said? I am here. I am urgently going abroad with my family. Leave my hand. Come. Leave my hand. Hey! Open the door. Looks like the oldie is unable to do it himself. Someone help him please. Hello Uncle, if you do not open the door, I will send the spirits on to you. Hey idiot! You have locked such big door from the outside. You fool! Oh my! That's my technique Door Magnet! We have been doing this for ages! Find some new techniques! There is someone at the main board. He is useless. I will not even keep him for a day! The person on the main board should be super fast! Only then you can distract. He is damn slow! How will one be scared at this? In our work, timing and detailing is very important. That was late. The passing was late. Do you all know how to do the passing? When I turn to my left during the power cut, on my right... Did you just go so fast? Your work is excellent. He will outgrow his boss. Just watch out. Bro! Do come and meet me later. Why are you all showing this to me? You must be showing it to your customers. I am also in the same business. Will I be scared? You guys do not know about this Samrat of spirits. You all have taken a big risk. I'll show who I am. Do you all know the Assistant Commissioner and Minister? I'll call them and put it on the loudspeaker. Just listen. You all have a signal jammer is it? Hmmm. Impressive. It is too late! You all should've dropped the chandelier the moment I entered. Only then the sound will scare. When you drop it it should come near me in a jiffy. Only then will it be a jump scare. You seem to be interested. But you lack experience. Do you know how this is? It does not look like the chandelier is coming down. It looks like I came very smoothly to the chandelier. Why did you all lift me up? I am scared of heights. I can not find any rope! Listen I am stranded without any support. This is very dangerous. Please drop me as smoothly as you all lifted me. Just do not drop me. Be careful. I've been telling you all to take it easy! We should be scaring the shit out. We should not be scaring the life out! My dad is a heart patient. I can also get it, is not it? Please sir. Super An artist must appreciate another artist. That is the rule of theatrics. Everything was wonderful. Bye If you can open the door, I will just flee. Is that a dog! Did you all vaccinate it properly? The dog looks like a ghost! Do not you understand what I am talking? Do you speak hindi? I know Hindi. This dog !! The dog! Might just take bunch my flesh! Are you blessing us after looting the 500 crores? So you found out. I'll whack you! Get up! Whatever it is, we will go out and discuss. Let's go It's painful. Take your hands off. My hands are not under my control. I'll spare the bag. My hands are not in my control. I am not holding you. I've been possessed. Please come fast and save us. I did not do anything. Nothing is in my control. You should not hit swami! Stop it! Stop it! My hands are not in my control. Listen to what I am saying! Please control it. Did not I tell you. I told you my hands are not in my control. Please bring me down. The bag is more important. Bring him down. If you try a little more we can go faster. Get me down and we will all get away from this place. What are you all looking at? Come let's leave. Hold him firmly. I'll whack him. He has gone up again! Why have you gone up? I do not know! Come here. Am coming! Kaashmora Swami! Please save us lord! I messed with you without knowing that you are a ghost! Please save us. Oh ghostly lord! Oh lord! Oh lord! I came in without knowing that it is a ghost. Save us ghostly lord! Pity these guys who are being whacked! Please forgive us lord! Wait! I will do something. Do not forsake us oh lord! Save us! Save us! You all are lucky! Look what I have got. Hold it! Hold it! All of you hold it together strongly. Inform the minister that I saved you all. Please save us lord! Please do not stop lord! Start the vehicle. Kaashu.... - Kaashu.... - Daddy Dad! - Where are you? - Am in the car. Where is the car? It's atop the tree! Oh my! You came up so many times and you did not notice us? How did you arrive here? Is the bag safe? The lives of the entire family is hanging here and you are concerned about the bag. - Please save us first. - Am coming. Dad. Why do not you drop the bag first? I can not trust you. First get us down. Then we'll see. Bro! Save us! Do something! Oh my god! Kaashu... I think the minister is doing all this with his Swami. No dad. It's not them. As Jalapathy Rao said, there is something in here. What are you saying? The fact that am caught here is fine. How did you all get caught here? Why are you just blabbering something? Is running away from such things new to our family? Come. Let's run away! Take it fast. Dad. Come fast. Mom come faster. Come! Faster! Faster! Dad come fast! This side! This side! Let's get inside. I am scared. Do not go inside. It's dangerous inside. Listen to me. Do not go inside !!! It's just a vessel. Oh yes ji! That's a ghost. I am not a ghost ji! Why do you say that like a ghost? What? Are you checking if I have my feet? Yes. That logic does not exist anymore! Now-a-days ghosts have every part of their body intact! Oh is it? That's fine. What place is this? What's happening here? It seems its a 700-800 year old palace. It was built for some princess named Rathnamahadevi. There was a sudden fire and half the palace was burnt it seems. Why do you follow me so close? Are you scared? Slightly. Tell me further. With no one to own, it landed in the hands of the British. They maintained this as a library for their officers. Then, suddenly one day .. An officer was reading a book. The dog on the book came alive and... Munched on his throat and the eyes of the officer popped out and died a gory death! There have been continuous deaths. Hence it has been locked for years. Ever since, this was branded as the haunted palace! Why did you all leave me alone? Follow me closely. Please come ji! After many years... Guntur Jalapathi Rao bought this palace for a low cost with the help of politicians. He got a few priests to do rituals inside the palace. The priest was... Why do you pause? Complete it. The head of the priest was turned back... And shouted 'Get Out'... Not just that... His wife was caught by the plait and then swiveled... ... And thrown out. He ran once and for all from here. He decided to sell it for any price that was quoted. He met me for that. Being a real estate agent, I immediately agreed! Do not leave so much gap. Please come closer. Did Jalapathi Rao come and meet you? Yes! Looks like he is always on the rounds. Then... He asked me to stay here for a night and then sell it. He gave five lakes as advance. I also gave the same reaction and now am trapped here. When I came in three doors were open. I came in easily. When I thought of going out... All the doors are closed! What is there in telling you... It's been one and half days since I've peed! Why? It's fully locked! It's completely jammed! I am relieved you've come... You are exorcists, is not it? Why are you all confused? Get rid of these ghosts fast. I have to meet my wives. But one thing... We need to be very careful. These ghosts are 700-800 years old. Careful !!! You talk about multiple ghosts... How many ghosts are in here ?? There are 13 ghosts. What are you all bluffing? People said he was godly. The Asst. Commissioner said he was a fraud. Now you all call him a ghost! It's 500 crores. How are we going to get it back from the ghost? What happened? Please leave this matter to me. These people have been horrified at something. The party documents are in there. In two days, it has to... Do not be tensed. I know the Atharvana Veda by heart. I will take care .. I will see you next with the money only. Hard earned money will never go waste. Then the whole of it is gone! Please come in line ji. There is nothing. There is nothing it seems. Do not shout! Listen to me do not shout! Mom and Dad... All of you stay away from me... All the ghosts are on me now.... Those are not ghosts my dear... It's just us... We got on top of you in fear! Get off me you scumbags! How much can a person carry! Do not be scared. If we are scared we will be scared or vice versa. Why are you blabbering something? - It is now that I feel scared! - Just shut up. Let me put on the light. Make it fast! Get the lights on. Switch it off! Lights off! We do not need any lights. Let's stay in the dark. That's the safest. Oh my God! My bag! My money! Who is this? The chief. The head. There is no head and you say he is the head? Why did you bring us here? Due to some reasons we are unable to leave this earth and go to our world. You need to solve the hindrances for us. Do you understand what he is saying? The ghosts that wander on earth with unfulfilled desires... ... You deliver them to the other world with some rituals, is not it... They want you to send them as well it seems. Who informed you that we would help in sending you tot he other world? You only informed! The secret of our success is... Not just one... All the five family members were born with Rohini star (sun sign) If you see before this .. gladiator... sorry... Alexander's family was the same... Even before that Elangovadigal's brother's family was like this. I am being modest in saying that we are the only family like that after them. Even now... We are going to bring a thousand spirits at one place .. ... Make them peaceful and send them to the other world. This will be guinness record. You must have seen the advertisements in papers and also the posters. There is a lot of it on the mount road. I just came inside. They all were looking at this paper for long. They then looked at me. Immediately all the doors were closed. Send them to the other world soon. Let's go home! He has got the family trapped with a quarter page ad. The ads have reached the ghosts! Sir... Sir... We do not have any powers like you think. We are just ordinary people. Even my mother here... Is very scared of spirits. It is to meet our ends... We are just doing some gimmicks in the name of exorcism. Please spare us. So you make business out of innocent people who want to get in touch with their dead loved ones. Oh my God! Looks like we might land in trouble if we tell him the truth. Talk to him just like how we talk to our customers. So he now wants to go to the other world. We need to solve it .. That is all. We can solve it. It's just a five minutes work. We can solve it in a jiffy. I will solve it for you. - Dad - Yes. Do you want to solve it or should I do it? It's just a petty work. You do it. I'll solve it. I will solve it for you. Bro... A very good idea .. I will immediately go home... ..take bath in cold thulasi water and with the wet cloth around me... ... On an empty stomach... ... At a specific time, I will pray to goddess Prathyangara... If I recite the 1008 spells a 1008 times... You can go from this world to any other world. Hope nobody wants rebirth here. If you can open the doors fast, I will make it fast. Mom and Dad! They are going to open the doors, please make it fast. Do not forget the bag. How do I trust if you would do whatever you said? My mom fed me with honesty along with milk. Trust me! I do not have any faith in trust! Whatever is destined to happen should happen within the four walls in three days, on Navakaaliga Pournami. We will ensure that you do not have any hindrances in carrying out your work for us. When the doors of heaven are opened for us... The doors of this palace will open for you. I told you the reason of bringing you here. Do not create any reason for me to kill you. When I meet you again, I will see you with the money only. No point in trusting you. Nothing happens without a reason here, Kaashmora! Go and seek for it. How did you get here? How do you know this place? It is not important on how I reached here. You will be shocked to know how you reached here. Remember Jalapathi Rao who came to meet you? Do you know who he is? Greetings. I am Guntur Jalapathi Rao I know. You were the one who sought help from Kaashmora .. Me? If I had known Kaashmora, why would I come and meet you? I took a video of his meeting with you. Only you are present in that video. The position where he was, there was something supernatural. He was a ghost. A real ghost had come in search of you. If a ghost can come and seek help from you... You are finished! What a man! The doors are locked. How did you get in? It was open. The doors are open? Come let's go. Mom, come fast. Look at her! Dozing away. - Get up! Come on. - Come on. Quick. Careful. Watch out. What happened? Why are all of you leaving? You just left the door open. What if the ghosts fear us and run away? That's why. Show us the door. Anyway you are closing the door. Please send me out and close the door. Make it soon brother. The ghosts might escape. Quick. Run! Run! What's in the bag? Equipments? Yes. Equipments. Go now. What are the equipments you have? Why do not you just ask all this on the way? Careful! They said that the doors were open. Went to close it so that the mosquitoes do not enter! By then, your men... Kaashmora... I need you. That is why the lord of death was fooled when he reached you! I was born on the battlefield, raised with sword fights, bathed in blood and grew up among corpses. One more run... You will run for your life! Fantastic! Hey idiot! Why do you scream like the ghosts? Greetings! I am Jalapathi Rao! Jalapathy Rao Look below the portrait. Its written in telugu about his birth and death date. You only said... ... That it was a ghost. He can be a ghost only if he is dead. It's been 75 years since he is dead. Ghosts can come to your place... That is fine... Why should it come to my house? Why would one go to one's house to search for someone and who would about know that? What is it? Look at that It's been 75 years since Jalapathy Rao died. If the script looks like scrambled eggs... ..does it mean that it is Jalapathy Rao? Do you know how he looks? He is fat, dark and fresh! Nothing happens here without a reason Kaashmora! Go and seek for it. Did you finish drinking? Did you finish drinking? What ji? You all are talking! Did you drink it completely? Yes! I am done! Why? Did you also want it? It is the remains of what our King had many centuries ago. We did not know what to do with it. You have been having it all these centuries! You should've disposed it if it was not needed! If we drink water that is uncovered for three days... ..it would upset our stomach. This was had by the king !!! I do not know what is going to happen! My eyes are rolling over! Is that all !!! The Kingdom of Vikranthaka This kingdom was ruled by Vijayanarayana Maruthapathi There were 13 generals in the army of the kingdom. There was one who was equal to the combined force of all the generals. The one who knew all warfare tactics and the one who can destroy all tactics... The bravest general!

Why does a flower need a sword? Strength and weakness are a trait of man. Women are a weakness of Rajanayak! Contrarily, it is an untold secret that... The weakness of women is Rajanayak! At a time when Rajnayak captured a northern kingdom Why did it take so long? This king has a total of 27 wives. He has another 30 girlfriends I will call them one after the other. You fool! It is quite a sight to see all of the stars in the sky! Call all of them! Stop Yes, my lord. Did you include them as well? They are the maids here my lord. What is the difference in women even if they are maids? Count them in as well. My lord! That is a statue! Statue! Let it be! It's the statue of a woman! The king knew about Rajanayak... The reason for his silence is Rajanayak's tactics in warfare. O King! The princess has been kidnapped. Rajanayak is also not in town. There is a possibility that it is Rajanayak who kidnapped her. The one who brings back Rathnamahadevi will be gifted with half the kingdom... ... And Rathnamahadevi will be married to that person. Make this announcement. Arjuna! Rajanayak. Rajanayak! Good that you know me! It is said that Rajanayak would single handedly win over a 1000 soldiers. People of our kingdom talk highly about your tactics in warfare. It is only today that I have seen it. Stop your flattery! Having known all this how dare you do such an act to my King's daughter? Arjuuuu. Rajanayak.... You are going to say that you were not kidnapped. Is not it? If you were kidnapped... You would've been in the front and he would've been holding you. It can easily be made out from the fact that you are seated behind with your hands on him that.... ... You were not kidnapped... but lured! We learnt sword fight from the same teacher... You fell in love instead of learning your tricks with the sword. He is a Prince of our rival kingdom... Hence you had an argument with your father and this kidnap episode was planned. Rajanayak... She can not live without me... I can not live without her either. Please let us go. If I had come only for the King's daughter, I would've spared you. But I came for... ..my bride .. Only for Rathu! Rajanayak! This is not the time for intimacy! Rajanayak! Are you a man? Rajanayak! No, is it? Kill me first... Then take her with you. Come. No Arjuna! You are praising me indirectly by stopping him my dear! Fine... I will be a little considerate for you. I do not need the sword. I do not need the shield either. Come .. Kill me first and take Rathna along with you. Come You might just lose out this opportunity! I can offer this only for a while. Come. O King! I can see the sorrow of me becoming your son in law, than the happiness of your daughter's return! Words and Swords should be used wisely in the presence of Rajanayak. As informed... Half the kingdom for saving your daughter... and the remaining half as the wedding gift shall be given. - My lord! - What? The Prince is the rightful heir to the throne. The Prince 'was' the heir apparent. Does any of you here want to be a thing of the past? Who's there? Clear the place and prepare for the coronation and wedding. Let the groom rest for a while. The blazing fire of desire The desire to touch the untouched beauty O King! Take a look at the moon. Stunned will you be on seeing my other side. Look for the angles that you've not seen. She is filled with an unquenchable thirst. The blazing fire of desire The desire to touch the untouched beauty As the clothes reveal my form My shadow desires for your touch. My hair is adorned by no flower Your breath shall adorn them As I earn for your touch everywhere There is a blazing fire of desire in me. As our hands clutch and our bodies unite Let this desire be forever As I blush and shrug May you feel me high! Let our desires be satisfied The blazing fire of desire The desire to touch the untouched beauty May your teeth hone my sculpted cheek. My bosoms are for you to rest peacefully. As I beg for the dawn to not break. Wait for the dawn to know me! As our visions pierce each other No one knows who wins! Your lust caresses me My desire overpowers you Let's see who wins over! Are your steps faltering, Rajanayak? You taught me this trick. The thought of marriage happening amidst the deaths of many... The doubt that if the leopard is crouching to pounce The alertness on how I might attack you... With the lady who is beauty personified next to you ... The lustful desire in you to have her at any cost... Amidst all these worries, my hair that has been virgin to artificial scents... ... Had been perfumed with the dreaded poison. You missed to take note of that! Rajanayak Not only in this birth... In every other births, I will be deciding your end. Without being able to go to the upper world or the lower world... May your soul wander without peace! I curse you in the name of our goddess Mahadevi! Having been cruel as a demon during his life... Due to the curse of Rathnamahadevi He has now transformed into the most dreaded demon! The kingdom shattered In the palace of Rathnamahadevi Rajanayak ... And his subordinates who were burnt alive... ... Conducted meetings at midnight People living around the palace ..started fleeing in groups from the kingdom. Loyalists of the kingdom who tried to get back the palace .. ... Brought a lot of astrologers and conducted many rituals. The curse of Rajanayak is much more worse than Brahmahatya dosham (murder of a brahmin) Unless he is delivered from the curse, the supernatural activities can never be stopped. And that is not easy. On the day of Navakaliga Pournami, that comes once in thousand years... ..by doing the rituals by the fire created in a pit at the center of a Chakra. People of the same family having the same Rohini star... ..shall be sacrificed in the ritual. Only then the soul of Rajanayak will be delivered from the curse. All the five members of our family were born on Rohini (tamil sun sign) The ritual has to be conducted by a virgin first girl child of the entire generation! Ghosts can come to your house. That's fine. Why should it come to my house? Even after all this the ritual is completed... There is a strange problem. The soul of Rajanayak will be delivered from the curse due to these rituals... It is uncertain about the demonic nature of his soul. No one can judge it but his soul. Is there a way out? Shift the capital of the kingdom and continue with the rule. Rajanayak and his subordinates who were burnt alive... ... Started waiting for Navakaaliga Pournami. Whatever is destined to happen should happen within the four walls in three days, on Navakaaliga Pournami. Why do you film all this? Fine You... ..have an elder sister, is not it? Elder sister? No! Elder sister means not your own .. Cousins or anyone... You have, is not it? No! I am the only girl child in the entire family. Why? Why means? I am the only girl child in all our generation. What can I do about it? Who asked you to be born without a sister? You have come to just take my life out! Will they sacrifice the entire family? Why is he so paranoid? Has he forgotten all his spells? What are you saying? He is the greatest villain of all times! He did not bring us to send him to the other world. He has brought us to be sent to the other world! If he has to be delivered off his curse... He has to sacrifice five members of the family born on Rohini star (sun sign) Yamini did not come here due to her interest. He has brought her here. She is the one who will execute us. What are you saying? Did the spirit lie to us then? What will you do if he had told the truth? I would have died of a heart attack. That's why he did not tell you! If we have been protected by him so far It means, he needs all five of us Chief It is not an ordinary ghost that is inside. The head goes one side. The body goes the other side. It just thrashes anyone who goes inside. But .. If it has kept Kaashmora inside... Something else is happening there. Navakaaliga Pournami Rathnamahadevi On the day of Navakaaliga pournami when our curse will be delivered... ... When five mortals of Rohini star are sacrificed... This Rajanayak will resurrect once again! Where are you going? The haunted palace is being bombed to demolish. The whole town is heading there to watch it. What you see in the backdrop is an ancient palace. It is famously known as the Mettukulam haunted palace. This haunted palace is being demolished by bombing today. Please think hard once again. Why do not you try something with exorcists? I have done everything! I have approached everyone from Chottanikkara temple to Sholinganallur Dargah! There is no use. Blast it and finish it once and for all. Are you guys kidding? 500 crores! Important documents of the party. He has got everything and is inside with this family. What if he dies in there? There is a lot of public The entire media is here as well. Please do not create any troubles. The one inside is equal to a thousand bombs! I have seen him. Trust me! All these bombings will do nothing to him. It should explode in the early morning. Increase the dynamite in the support channels. People on the right channel, come on line. Rajanayak !! Just as I cursed you before... ... In all your births... Your end is always with me. You? It's me! Just because he loved me... ... I had to witness the end of Arjunan! The reason for the death of my father who trusted you. The one who turned lifeless at the death of my innocent brother. The one who killed you for these and became the omnipresent! You can never stop me from conducting this ritual! No matter whatever form you take! Let's see. - What is happening here? - Go away! Until my task is completed... ... This body is mine! Rathna even snaps only with her left hand! You are playing with the sword in your right hand! What ??? Rathnamahadevi is left handed ??? With all that performance, you fumbled with the wrong hand! For a while you made me a fool with your theatrics my dear Kaashoo! Kaashmora... Kaashmora... What happened? Rathnamahadevi! Kaashmora... Go and seek... Come grandma... Welcome Rathna! Let there be more meaning to my years of waiting! Come Come let's leave faster! This way! Come. Let's take the other way. You all please wait here. Same place... Same full moon night... Same curse... Same hatred... The same you and the same me! Come Rajanayak! Before the full moon night ends... Let my sword finish you off! The mortals remains of Rajnayak is present somewhere. Finding it might help in solving this issue. Please stop! The ghosts have been destroyed! Dad What happened? Rathnamahadevi saved all of us. What? We saved Rathnamahadevi! That's better! Yamini... Yamini... Get up! Get up. Take a look at the mightiness of the lord! What happened? Just like the name Kaashmora signifies... ... He has sent all the ghosts to the underworld. He sent them all? Oh my! I missed it! Can we do a replay for that? He has incarnated! Praise him! Hail Kaashmora! Incarnation? Yes dear! He awakened his highest possible power ... And transformed into a ball of light... ... And became the higher one! Take a look at the mightiness! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Stop it! I have placed a camera here and it must have recorded everything! We can find it out now. Look its kaṣmora sāmī! It's a good crowd Must make this chance to be public.. What the hell,did you mean a demon to that? He's like Tendulkar , raises his hand after hitting a centuary.. I told you, sir, he's not a normal preson.. He's very popular in the village now.. Now if they even built a temple, it's nothing to be surprised of.. Whether these inhuman things are... Are true or not? facilitating this debate.. Over hundred years There was in the mind fear of the people .. Everyone must accept that Kāṣmōrā family put it to an end.. Sāmī! We fought with them,but only this bag was saved.. what? -Haven't you heard the saying "Money is the devil".. But they chased us like hell .. Took the money and flew away .. Are all the documents here? Only documents are there.. Sāmī! Be careful .. Do not crash .. Be careful .. Hey! Sāmī! Hey sāmī!
