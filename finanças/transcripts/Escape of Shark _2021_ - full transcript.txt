Wang Lei, do you take Feng Luan to be your wife Through the difficult and the easy, through the rich and the poor, through the illness and the disaster. Come what may, will you always be there for Feng Luan and protect her? I do. Nice. Now you can put the ring on your bride's finger. Escape of Shark Good morning, everyone. Welcome to today's morning news. Let's come to the main part of today's programe. The low pressure cyclone formed by this year's typhoon is much weaker than that of the last year. Thus there is more sunlight. Such an abnormal climate will make a huge number of migrant birds head north earlier. Recently, two more killer whales stranded on the beach. This has been the fourth case of the whale stranding in the May of this year. Some experts pointed out that this is related with the change in magnetic fields caused by the slight oceanic slab squeeze. But those movements won't exert any influence on the land. Some Japanese geologists claimed that this series of abnormal phenomena in the last month are a precursor to a major earthquake. However, Thai tourism officials are against this view. They mentioned it as a regular change rendered by seasonal tides. The two parties even had an argument about it online. Next, let's see more details. So many birds. Wang Lei! Stop there! Finally I got you today! Wang Lei! Wang Lei! I saw you! Get out of there! Wang Lei! I'll catch you! Wang Lei! Stop there, Wang Lei! You didn't pay me back and now you're even stealing my ship! How dare you? Come back! This will be your first time to experience the joy of diving in the sea. Unlike in the pool before, you'll feel the charm of the sea. Remember what I taught you, the ear pressure balance and neutral buoyancy. Are you okay, honey? I'm fine. Damn you! Is it fun? Didn't you hear me laughing just now? Since it wasn't fun, why would I laugh? Apologize! Apologize? It's impossible for me to apologize. You can never feel the joy of the rich throughout your life. What are you looking at? Cheer up! Nice to meet you. Please go rest in the lobby first. Thank you. You are so sexy. Welcome! Thank you. Welcome. We've prepared drinks for you. Welcome. Later we'll help you check in. Welcome. Come on, take a picture of me. Why do you always ask to take photos? I'm fed up with that. Cheese. Be happier! Okay, here you are. Welcome! Welcome! Wait for me! Thank you. This way please. Boss Su! Don't call me that. I'm not boss. You are! No? Boss Su, I'm so sorry. I know I'm late. Boss Su! Stop that? Don't stutter. You reek of alcohol so early in the morning. Wang Lei, do you still want your salary of this month? Boss Su! Let me explain, please! A glass of champagne, thank you. Come on! Hey, beauty, enjoy yourself! Hello! You are beautiful! You are good! You have a good time. OK. Keep a close eye on everything. If anything happens at the welcome party tonight, you'll be sacked. Understand? Please rest assured, Boss Su. I swear on my life that nothing will happen at the party tonight. Boss Su, please don't deduct my salary of this month. The creditor even went to the place I live in. I nearly failed to make my way here. See that man over there? Listen, he's the little master of the Saint Laurent Hotel Chain, who came here specially for investigation and acquisition. Behave yourself these days, and serve this little master well. If you screw the acquisition up, you can never afford to pay me back. Got it? Don't worry, Boss Su. I promise nothing will happen. Wang Lei, drink less alcohol, and you can get everything. Were it not for my late niece, I? Alright? Mind you, no more drinking my wine again! Mr. Sang Ni! Have you had enough fun today? Come on! Wipe your drool. Lisa? You look different today. You, too. No money for rent? And no money for alcohol? Otherwise you won't dress so decently. Mind your words! Do your work, and don't try to drink wine stealthily. If spotted by Boss Su, your remuneration will be deducted again. I? Alright, work! How do you feel today, Mr. Sang Ni? Mr. Sang Ni, the environment here is really nice. Look! Look over there! Mr. Sang Ni? Piss off. Hey, beauty. What's wrong again? Sorry for what I did earlier. I scared you, so I'm here specially to apologize. What? It's too late to apologize. Why didn't you do it earlier? I'm apologizing to the beauty. And what's it got to do with you? She's my wife! Of course it has something to do with me! The glass is yours just because you hold it? Now it's fallen on the ground. Is it still yours? Could you keep it in your hand all the time? You? Honey! Honey! Are you alright, honey? What happened? I have no idea! It's strange. Scared me. Hey! Everyone! It's okay. Listen, there are frequent earthquakes in this sea. It's far away from us. Don't worry and chill out! Let's continue to have fun! DJ, drop the beat! Go on! Keep playing! Go over there if you wanna jump into the sea. Don't block my view here. I knew you're here slacking off. Your words are so harsh! Why is there no signal on my phone again? The signal tower on the island always malfunctions. It's normal. You! No wonder you can't find a boyfriend. You? What man dares to marry you? I, Lisa Chen, is not an easy woman. Besides, Being alone means freedom. Quite good. I almost believed what you said. Then who do you want to please by dressing in such fancy clothes? What? Can't that one be you? Stop. I dare not to be that one. I'm weak, and I'd like to live a little longer. What are you talking about? Enough talk about me. So what about you? Nothing interesting. Keep drinking like this? Now because of that issue, the former free diving champion won't even jump into the water again. So what? Now I work from sunup until sundown. Isn't this what life is all about? I knew you still couldn't get over her. Otherwise, a proud guy like you won't settle for staying on this island. Fine. I'll stop it. Let's just drink. What are you doing? Haven't I told you to deliver the seafood to the back door? Why are you here? Go away! The car couldn't go through. All the things of the pool party last night have blocked the way. The mess hasn't been cleaned yet? Wang Lei! That bastard! Aright, alright. Move them to the back! To the back! Be careful. Just do your work! Look forward to see you again. The car I hailed will be here soon. Where's that tough guy who courted me? Honey, it's because you dress so provocatively. It's because I'm charismatic. Of course. Your beauty and charm are enough to make the moon hide and flowers feel shy. What? I might have left my phone in the room. Then go back to get it. I'll be right back. How could I marry a loser like you... Honey. Lisa. Lisa! Run! Run! Now! Thank you. It's okay. Dad, come on! Coach! Thank God, you're alive. Is there anyone else? My dad and I. There! Two people are there! Me! I'm here! Only you guys? What happened? It's an earthquake. The earthquake caused a tsunami. Why haven't we received any warning? The earthquake made the signal tower collapse. We have no signals on this island now. So will someone come to save us? If they come to our rescue, it will be tomorrow. Besides, we have no idea how much damage the tsunami caused to the land. Aftershock! Watch out! How are you holding up? I'm fine. Honey. I need you to get out of here and climb onto the cabinet on three. One, two, three! Hello? Help! Is anyone here? Help! Hello? Help! Anybody here? The water level's getting higher. If this keeps going up, I'm afraid the whole canteen will be underwater. I don't want to die here. Xiao Pang, think of something! The whole hotel is flooded. Where else can we go? We are trapped here. What should we do now? Will there be people coming to our rescue? Dad. I'm so scared. I'm here. Let's go to the lobby. It's higher there. We may have a chance to be rescued. Why can't we just swim out of here? Right. Good idea! Go! Now! Let's go. Help me. Come out, guys! It's safe on the island. Just swim over and we'll be saved. Alright. Run! Hurry! Come on. Hold on. Think of something! Or we'll all be eaten by the shark. Hold on, guys! Hold on! Let me help. It's done. The door opened! Sweetie. Don't waste your time here. Leave now! No, I won't! I can't leave you here! Hurry! No! Go now! No! Go! Leave! Hurry! Dad! Come with us! Dad! Go! Dad! Dad! Daddy! Dad! Dad! Dad! Get out of here! Dad! Dad! Go away! Dad! Dad! Wang Lei! Wang Lei, wake up! Wang Lei! Wang Lei! Wake up, Wang Lei! Wake up! Are you all right? I'm fine. Where are the others? Where's Song Wenwen's father? It was the shark... Crying won't help! What matters now is that we are still alive. We have to get out of here now! Can you just stop talking? Don't act like a hero in front of me. Who do you think you are? What's that glare? I'm not to blame that your father got eaten by a shark. They ran away first. Don't blame it on me! Enough! If I hadn't held the fire door to keep the shark outside, all of you would've been dead now! Fine. We'll split here. Don't follow me! This way. The shark! It's a toy. How dare you scare me! How dare you scare me! Hurry! Send somebody to save us. Hello? How dare you scare me. How dare you scare me. I'll kill you. How dare you scare me. Is anybody out there? How dare you scare me. Anybody there? Anybody? Who's there? Is it Sang Ni? It's Su Pan. I'm trapped in the storage room. Help me get out. Hang in there for a moment. I can't open the door. I'll get someone to save you. No! Sang Ni, you can't leave me here. Sang Ni! You bastard! You leave me dying. Anybody there? Help! Anybody there? Stop shouting, dear. Don't waste your energy. People would have come if there's any. Let's give a try again. On the count of three. One. Two. Three. Come on! Thank god! You're still alive. What about the others? What's the noise? Xiao Pang. Xiao Pang is dead. Don't move. What happened? I don't know. He was walking in front and then fell down in the water. Is this place haunted? He got an electric shock. We'd end up like him if there's electricity here. Don't worry. Water is conductive but also resistive. You'll be fine if you keep a safe distance. The distance between here and the switchroom should be safe. But that front area... We might not be able to pass. We need to turn off the main switch. Are we able to get across? Yeah. Unless you can fly. Fly? Slow down. Electric shock. I say, since we have nowhere to go, let's just stay here and wait for rescue. Good idea. Let's wait here. I can't go anywhere. What are you looking at? The body is floating away. There is water. He was floating in it. What's the big fuss about? Since the fire door is closed, the water shouldn't be flowing. The water level is rising. According to the water flow, it seems that the water's leaking from the fire door. That's impossible. I closed the door. I shut it tight. It's the shark. It shouldn't be possible. That's a fire door. It depends on the size of the shark. What do we do now? We can't stay here and die. Didn't you just say we wait for rescue? You change your mind now? If you could shut your mouth and use your brain, we wouldn't even die here. You... Wang Lei, how could you talk to Sang Ni like this. Brother Sang Ni, don't get angry. Don't get angry. Get lost. Don't panic! Come on. Wang Lei, walk quietly. Be careful! Wang Lei! Wang Lei! Wang Lei! Say something! Wang Lei! Wang Lei! You brat! Can't you kick me lightly? Why didn't you say anything? I thought you were dead. Can you be sensible? If I died and said something to you, do you dare to answer? Stop joking. What are you looking at? Give me the axe. Let's go. Go! Honey! How is it? I can't, my dear. Are we trapped in here? Let's wait and pray that the rescue team will save us soon. Honey. I'm scared. Don't be scared. I'll drag them to somewhere you can't see. What's happening? Why is the door blocked? Get out of the way! What's wrong? I'm fine. I just feel a bit nauseous. Wang Lei, Wenwen is hurt. Take it. She may have a fever. It's suppurating. She's wounded by a rusty metal. Tetanus. We have to clean the wound and bandage it. Can you make it through? Up there! Can you crawl through there? The hole is too small to crawl through. Wang Lei, come up with something. There's no tool. None of us can get through. Now the only path is blocked. Who can tell me what we should do? I really want to blow up this damn hotel! We must look for rescue immediately and send her to the hospital. If her rescue is delayed, her life may be at risk. And you still care for her. If our rescue is delayed, we would all die here. Su Pan. Isn't there a phone in the room? How about this. You go back to the room and call for help. Hurry. Hurry. No, I'm not going. The shark is over there. Cut the crap and go. Brother Sang Ni, the water is rising so high. The shark probably has already crashed the fire door open. Don't talk nonsense. The fire door is hard enough. Wang Lei, the water is rising again. I can't treat Wenwen's wound. Don't let her wound get wet. No wonder you want to sell the hotel to me. It's so cheaply built. Enough. You got energy. Come and smash the wall. Smash the wall. If I remember correctly, the hotel lobby is behind this wall. Since there isn't any path, we should make our own path. Now I hope your hotel is really cheaply built. Will it work? Honey. Dear. The bodies are gone. Honey. What if there's only the two of us in the hotel? The rescue team won't find us. We'll be stuck in here from the tsunami until we starve to death. No, we won't. It's impossible. Stop thinking about it. I'm here for you. Don't worry. Honey. I know you're very brave. It's my fault. You are by my side. I'm not scared. My dear. Your words suddenly make me blushed. Who? Didn't you say it was cheaply built? When can you tell the truth? Mr. Sang Ni, I don't know anything about buildings. I just know how much was spent. You... You can't smash the wall with brute strength. It'll still be like this even after you smash for three more hours. Stop talking. Listen to me. You first mark a spot on the wall. Mark one here. And one here. This is Hooke Law. Do what I say. Mr. Sang Ni. What are we doing here? No wonder the water is rising so fast. The shark crashed the fire door open. What should we do now? That guy's right. We'd better head back quickly to the lobby. The fire door can't keep long. Let's go. Okay. Someone is coming to save us. We're here! Here. Where are you? We're here. Over here. Here! How are you doing? Is everything alright? We're alright. Are you here to save us? Is there only the two of you? Two. How about you? We've got five. Wait for us to come over. We didn't expect there were people alive. Well, how did you know this magical formula? My dad taught me. He's an architect. Sang Ni. Where are those two? The shark! Sang Ni! Wang Lei! The water is rising again. That's not good. The shark broke through the fire door. Hurry! Lisa! Take her there. Find a place above water to hide. Be careful! Don't worry. Help! Where's Su Pan? He's been eaten by the shark. Don't mind him. Save me first! Come on! Hurry up! Grab my hand! How are you feeling, Wenwen? Are you okay? Go. Wang Lei. Wang Lei! Wang Lei! Are you all right, Wang Lei? Wang Lei! Rise with the lark and go to bed with the lamb every day. Life. Isn't that what life is all about? Wang Lei! Answer me, Wang Lei! Wake up! Wang Lei. Wang Lei. Get up! For better or for worse, will you stand up for her and protect her? Danger! Wang Lei. I do. Are you okay, Wang Lei? Wang Lei. I'm okay! Where did the shark come from? Where else could it come from? The sea. I urge you to leave it alone. Two people already died of its attack. Soaring legend Wang, what do we do now? We have to get out. No way. The gates are blocked by the truck. I tried a lot of ways but I failed. Rubbish. Otherwise you two would be long gone, instead of waiting here for us. Even if he moves the truck, the shark will still come after us. Don't move! Don't move! What's happening? With so many people out there, why is it after me? Who's this? The guy at the lobby desk. They were drowned. I'm the one who moved their bodies there. No wonder this beast is swimming around me. It was you! Nonsense! Are you looking for trouble? Who's looking for trouble? What's wrong with you? Why did you move the bodies? You want to feed the shark? You're the one with problems. Given this situation, why are you talking nonsense? What nonsense! You think I don't know? You're a fake rich kid! Say that again. I have an idea. You pretended to be rich. You think you're rich? What are you talking about?! About you! Are you picking a fight? I found a way to get out of here. No. I disagree. It's too dangerous. She's right. Is there any other way? It's the best way. The shark's attracted by the blood in the seafood truck. It can smell it but can't eat it. So it'll maybe crash the plank under our feet to feed on us as feast. I agree. We can't just sit there and wait. Enough of your sarcasm. It's Wang Lei who will risk his life. Not you. Come on! He wanted me to be the bait. Why don't we switch our roles? If I can get through, I'll shove you down there as bait. Who are you talking to bastard? I'm talking to you! All right, cut it out. Save your breath and think. If I fail later, who's next? Who? It's our only chance to escape from the shark. Do as I say. Okay. Hang in there. Coach. I think I saw it. Wang Lei the shark is behind you. Sang Ni paddle the water. Quick! Come here brute. Coach. Lisa! Coach, get back here! Lisa, come back! Lisa! Coach! Lisa! Come on! Lisa! Come back! Come here! Lisa! Eat me! Come back! Lisa! Lisa, get out of the water! Lisa! What are you doing? Get out of the water! Lisa! Come back! I'm here! Lisa! Come and eat me! Come on, Lisa. Lisa, get up here! Coach, come back! Lisa, get up there! Come on! Quick! Swim back! Lisa, give me your hand. Come on! Honey. Xiao Lin. Give me your hand. Don't panic. Don't panic! Swim this way, now! Honey, quick! Don't panic! Honey! Honey, pull me up! Help me! Sang Ni. Get the body over here. Hurry up, Sang Ni! Honey! What should I do? You have to do something to save him! Save my husband. Honey! What should I do? Do something! Wang Lei, light the fire! Honey! Don't go, honey! Honey! Honey! Are you okay, honey? Honey, wake up. Honey, don't go. Don't leave me alone. Honey! Honey, wake up. Wang Lei! Wang Lei! Wang Lei! Wake up! Wang Lei! Wang Lei! Wake up! Wang Lei! How dare you want to eat me? Eat me?! Eat me?! Wang Lei! Wang Lei! Wake up! If you don't wake up... If you don't wake up, I'll beat you to death. You're such a... You're gonna kill me if I don't get blown up. I'll go check on the others. Honey! He still has heartbeat. He's alive. Get help now! Honey! Hang in there, honey. We'll get help. Can you hold on? Yes. Honey! Wang Lei, do you take Feng Luan to be your wife Through the difficult and the easy, through the rich and the poor, through the illness and the disaster. Come what may, will you always be there for Feng Luan and protect her? I do. Nice. Now you can put the ring on your bride's finger. Escape of Shark Good morning, everyone.

I closed the door. I shut it tight. It's the shark. It shouldn't be possible. That's a fire door. It depends on the size of the shark. What do we do now? We can't stay here and die. Didn't you just say we wait for rescue? You change your mind now? If you could shut your mouth and use your brain, we wouldn't even die here. You... Wang Lei, how could you talk to Sang Ni like this. Brother Sang Ni, don't get angry. Don't get angry. Get lost. Don't panic! Come on. Wang Lei, walk quietly. Be careful! Wang Lei! Wang Lei! Wang Lei! Say something! Wang Lei! Wang Lei! You brat! Can't you kick me lightly? Why didn't you say anything? I thought you were dead. Can you be sensible? If I died and said something to you, do you dare to answer? Stop joking. What are you looking at? Give me the axe. Let's go. Go! Honey! How is it? I can't, my dear. Are we trapped in here? Let's wait and pray that the rescue team will save us soon. Honey. I'm scared. Don't be scared. I'll drag them to somewhere you can't see. What's happening? Why is the door blocked? Get out of the way! What's wrong? I'm fine. I just feel a bit nauseous. Wang Lei, Wenwen is hurt. Take it. She may have a fever. It's suppurating. She's wounded by a rusty metal. Tetanus. We have to clean the wound and bandage it. Can you make it through? Up there! Can you crawl through there? The hole is too small to crawl through. Wang Lei, come up with something. There's no tool. None of us can get through. Now the only path is blocked. Who can tell me what we should do? I really want to blow up this damn hotel! We must look for rescue immediately and send her to the hospital. If her rescue is delayed, her life may be at risk. And you still care for her. If our rescue is delayed, we would all die here. Su Pan. Isn't there a phone in the room? How about this. You go back to the room and call for help. Hurry. Hurry. No, I'm not going. The shark is over there. Cut the crap and go. Brother Sang Ni, the water is rising so high. The shark probably has already crashed the fire door open. Don't talk nonsense. The fire door is hard enough. Wang Lei, the water is rising again. I can't treat Wenwen's wound. Don't let her wound get wet. No wonder you want to sell the hotel to me. It's so cheaply built. Enough. You got energy. Come and smash the wall. Smash the wall. If I remember correctly, the hotel lobby is behind this wall. Since there isn't any path, we should make our own path. Now I hope your hotel is really cheaply built. Will it work? Honey. Dear. The bodies are gone. Honey. What if there's only the two of us in the hotel? The rescue team won't find us. We'll be stuck in here from the tsunami until we starve to death. No, we won't. It's impossible. Stop thinking about it. I'm here for you. Don't worry. Honey. I know you're very brave. It's my fault. You are by my side. I'm not scared. My dear. Your words suddenly make me blushed. Who? Didn't you say it was cheaply built? When can you tell the truth? Mr. Sang Ni, I don't know anything about buildings. I just know how much was spent. You... You can't smash the wall with brute strength. It'll still be like this even after you smash for three more hours. Stop talking. Listen to me. You first mark a spot on the wall. Mark one here. And one here. This is Hooke Law. Do what I say. Mr. Sang Ni. What are we doing here? No wonder the water is rising so fast. The shark crashed the fire door open. What should we do now? That guy's right. We'd better head back quickly to the lobby. The fire door can't keep long. Let's go. Okay. Someone is coming to save us. We're here! Here. Where are you? We're here. Over here. Here! How are you doing? Is everything alright? We're alright. Are you here to save us? Is there only the two of you? Two. How about you? We've got five. Wait for us to come over. We didn't expect there were people alive. Well, how did you know this magical formula? My dad taught me. He's an architect. Sang Ni. Where are those two? The shark! Sang Ni! Wang Lei! The water is rising again. That's not good. The shark broke through the fire door. Hurry! Lisa! Take her there. Find a place above water to hide. Be careful! Don't worry. Help! Where's Su Pan? He's been eaten by the shark. Don't mind him. Save me first! Come on! Hurry up! Grab my hand! How are you feeling, Wenwen? Are you okay? Go. Wang Lei. Wang Lei! Wang Lei! Are you all right, Wang Lei? Wang Lei! Rise with the lark and go to bed with the lamb every day. Life. Isn't that what life is all about? Wang Lei! Answer me, Wang Lei! Wake up! Wang Lei. Wang Lei. Get up! For better or for worse, will you stand up for her and protect her? Danger! Wang Lei. I do. Are you okay, Wang Lei? Wang Lei. I'm okay! Where did the shark come from? Where else could it come from? The sea. I urge you to leave it alone. Two people already died of its attack. Soaring legend Wang, what do we do now? We have to get out. No way. The gates are blocked by the truck. I tried a lot of ways but I failed. Rubbish. Otherwise you two would be long gone, instead of waiting here for us. Even if he moves the truck, the shark will still come after us. Don't move! Don't move! What's happening? With so many people out there, why is it after me? Who's this? The guy at the lobby desk. They were drowned. I'm the one who moved their bodies there. No wonder this beast is swimming around me. It was you! Nonsense! Are you looking for trouble? Who's looking for trouble? What's wrong with you? Why did you move the bodies? You want to feed the shark? You're the one with problems. Given this situation, why are you talking nonsense? What nonsense! You think I don't know? You're a fake rich kid! Say that again. I have an idea. You pretended to be rich. You think you're rich? What are you talking about?! About you! Are you picking a fight? I found a way to get out of here. No. I disagree. It's too dangerous. She's right. Is there any other way? It's the best way. The shark's attracted by the blood in the seafood truck. It can smell it but can't eat it. So it'll maybe crash the plank under our feet to feed on us as feast. I agree. We can't just sit there and wait. Enough of your sarcasm. It's Wang Lei who will risk his life. Not you. Come on! He wanted me to be the bait. Why don't we switch our roles? If I can get through, I'll shove you down there as bait. Who are you talking to bastard? I'm talking to you! All right, cut it out. Save your breath and think. If I fail later, who's next? Who? It's our only chance to escape from the shark. Do as I say. Okay. Hang in there. Coach. I think I saw it. Wang Lei the shark is behind you. Sang Ni paddle the water. Quick! Come here brute. Coach. Lisa! Coach, get back here! Lisa, come back! Lisa! Coach! Lisa! Come on! Lisa! Come back! Come here! Lisa! Eat me! Come back! Lisa! Lisa, get out of the water! Lisa! What are you doing? Get out of the water! Lisa! Come back! I'm here! Lisa! Come and eat me! Come on, Lisa. Lisa, get up here! Coach, come back! Lisa, get up there! Come on! Quick! Swim back! Lisa, give me your hand. Come on! Honey. Xiao Lin. Give me your hand. Don't panic. Don't panic! Swim this way, now! Honey, quick! Don't panic! Honey! Honey, pull me up! Help me! Sang Ni. Get the body over here. Hurry up, Sang Ni! Honey! What should I do? You have to do something to save him! Save my husband. Honey! What should I do? Do something! Wang Lei, light the fire! Honey! Don't go, honey! Honey! Honey! Are you okay, honey? Honey, wake up. Honey, don't go. Don't leave me alone. Honey! Honey, wake up. Wang Lei! Wang Lei! Wang Lei! Wake up! Wang Lei! Wang Lei! Wake up! Wang Lei! How dare you want to eat me? Eat me?! Eat me?! Wang Lei! Wang Lei! Wake up! If you don't wake up... If you don't wake up, I'll beat you to death. You're such a... You're gonna kill me if I don't get blown up. I'll go check on the others. Honey! He still has heartbeat. He's alive. Get help now! Honey! Hang in there, honey. We'll get help. Can you hold on? Yes. Honey!
