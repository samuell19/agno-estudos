Get down! Get back! Get back! It's not working! Medic! Medic! What's your name? Gunfire everywhere! Incoming! What do you want? Hey, Butchie. You got an extra pair of them socks? These dogs is itching me like crazy. Should've packed two pair. I did. Put holes in the first pair after three days. Damn it. I wish I was born flat foot. My cousin's kid brother got flat feet, he found out he couldn't get into the army. He hung himself in my uncle's barn. You're so full of shit, Kirk. Your cousin's kid brother's still your cousin, ain't he? Why would you call him anything else? No kidding, he's my cousin. Who would lie about that? Do you even know why you lie? Who you crackin' wise at? The outpost is 30 miles over those hills. Let's move out. Feel a jeep comin'. How many M7s we got? Maybe we should've spared that jeep. Still have a long way to walk. Yeah, 'cause it worked out so well for them. Nazis ain't so tough now, are ya? You ain't gonna be needing this. Nope. Hey, Butchie, keep your eyes out for any maps, coded messages, anything we can use against these guys. What do you think I'm doing? Hey, Butchie, we got a live one. You want I should reel him in? Or throw him back? He's a major. That'll do. Let's go, Jerry, put up your dukes. ♪ When you're smilin' ♪ Oh, when you're smilin' ♪ The whole world smiles... ♪ ...with you... ♪ Huh? Huh? Shut up, Eugene. Scruff fuck knows exactly what I'm saying. Huh? Huh? All right. - Huh? All right. - Yeah. Hey, look at Rocky Graziano. Mother Mary, this guy is good. Nearest crossing now is two miles over that hill. Go get him, Butchie. Yep. Come on, you're swinging like a ding-a-ling. Sorry, guys, we're way behind. Think I made a wrong turn. Pack up. I won't hurt you. It's okay. Take it. Feels like my feet are gonna fall off. Once we get there, it'll be cake. You guys can sleep for days. Who we babysitting this time? Not a "who." A mansion or a castle. It's supposed to be a big deal when the 82nd Airborne came through and pushed out the Nazi High Command. We're to hold it till our relief comes. - How long is that? - As long as it takes. Yowza, yowza, yowza. Clean sheets and toilet paper. No wonder the Nazis commandeered it. Yeah. What's not to love? Maybe he's just sleeping. Yeah, not enough rooms. Easy, little, your relief is here. You fall asleep star gazing or something? Get your gear. Our relief is here. I think I died and gone to heaven, boys. Man, you kidding me? Look at this. This place is as big as Roseland. It's bigger than my whole neighborhood in Queens. Okay, gear up and fall in. We're out in two minutes. - Wow. - What's the hurry? There's no hurry. Why aren't you all sleeping in the beds? It don't have bedbugs or something? Yeah, bedbugs. We put most of the mattresses in the basement. What's the story, morning glory? Any news on that thing? No. Uh, it doesn't pick up much out here. Must be broken. Broken, huh? Maybe you should leave it with us. Eugene there is a regular Marconian with a screwdriver. Yeah. Yeah. - Can I go now? - Not yet. Where's the grub? This place was a crowd base for operations, they stacked the pantry full of sausage, cheeses, wine and all the brandy that you can drink. Supply truck comes through to re-up in a week. They'll have fresh bread and K-rations. So what's wrong with the joint? I mean, if this place is like Coney Island, what's the rush? You're a day late. We're behind schedule. And some of us would like to make furlough, okay, asshole? Let's go. One of them left their rucksack behind. What do you mean you never had fondue? Were you raised in a brothel? Give him pots and pans and his Little Lord Fauntleroy. Hey, how far's the nearest cat house anyway? Heard the French girls are cut sideways. It's the Jap girls that are cut sideways, ya ding-a-ling. I don't see why we should be on lockdown. We could be here all week. I'm gonna take a look around the house. How about a fondue? Eugene! The cheese! Boo. This is the life, boys. What? Is that any good? Oh, yeah, it's about a machine that's supposed to be a mental portal between dimensions, but it turns out, it's also a portal between times. You could've just said no. Break's over. What the hell is that? Geez, what the fuck? Three, two, one. What the hell was that? You saw it, too? Not sure what I saw. Earl Grey? It's true. My cousin's letter says, "They're treating SPOW as well. "The food ain't so bad. "And we get to play baseball all day. "I love you. "And I can't wait to see you after the war." And then at the bottom in the letter, he writes, "P.S., save this stamp for Uncle Harold." Except there is no Uncle Harold in the family. So we analyzed steams off the stamp. All curious, you know. And underneath, written in small letters, five words... "They've cut out my tongue." God. What's that? Ah, I found it in the basement. Belonged to one of the Nazis who took over the house. Dieter Werner. 18 years old. Nazi shithead. You guys remember Louis from Bravo Company, the ginger from the pig farm? How that old whore stole his money roll, locked herself in the bathroom? What about her? He hears glass breaking, she starts screaming bloody murder, so he starts pounding on the door, trying to break in, but the door's solid. And for a couple of minutes, he gets through. Sees a broken window, the woman's ear in the sink, and written in the vanity in lipstick, "Welcome to the wonderful world of the clap." You're so full of shit, Butchie. Do you hear that? I hope it doesn't do that all night. I might have to sleep outside. You should if you're gonna read crap. Well... I could see why they left it behind. It says what happened to the family who lived here. And what he did to them. Guys, I think I'm going cuckoo. Is that Morse Code? I... H... A... V... E... N... O... Bullshit. L... E... G... S. "I have no legs"? Jesus. Oh. Get rid of that. It's covered in disease. Tsk. Who you supposed to be, my momma? Stop. That was bullshit, right? Tappert, take the attic tonight. Best vantage point if there's any conflict. We can all sleep in a bed tonight. And stay within shouting distance. Until we know what the fuck's happening. Come on. Open up. Shit. So, anyone wanna talk about last night? These boys seem like they wanted out in a hurry. Ever find out whose rucksack that was? Tappert's going through it. Think he'll find any gold teeth? He gives me the shivers. - I mean, after Paris... - Drop it, you two. You didn't find them sitting in a pool of blood. Six or seven 15-year-olds all... carved up. Hitler Youth. Guts all on the floor. And he's sitting there, you know, with that look he gets. That weird smile... And telling me they were smuggling diamonds. He showed you any diamonds? What do you think? Have I ever told you guys this part? He holds up his hands. He's got string around his fingers. You know, a cat's cradle? And he just goes... "Your move." All dreamily. Okay. That's a little laggy. One last thing to pull your coat to. It wasn't the first move. You know, like, a cat's cradle, the first 10 moves are easy and then it gets hard. So... who helped him get to move five in a room full of dead kids? Glad he's on our side. I think I figured out what put the bee in the bonnets of the last squad that was here. Radio said there's a German line coming through from Nuremberg to some kind of camp, in... in Strasbourg. There's some trucks. Maybe a couple dozen Jerries on foot. Shit. Look, I say we gear up, head into those woods and wait for 'em to pass. We stay here, we're fish in a barrel. We can't leave. Five guys against 50. - It's plain suicide. - We're staying. Great. Okay. Well, then I guess I'll just go up to the attic and try to spot 'em then. Either of you wanna maybe come help? Eugene? Come on. We can play cat's cradle. Not talking about people not in the room. What? What the hell is that? Black magic. Sacrificial altars. They say Hitler is a big believer in the occult. They say, huh? The Nazis must've committed ritualistic killings on the Helwigs. Sick pervs. Hey. Give me a hand, will you? You wanna take it over there? Yeah, okay. Got it. I got it. - Ready? - Mm-hm. One... Oh, fuck! You motherfucker! Hey, that wasn't me. Get away from me! God. You hear that? ...burning for eternity. They're coming for you. We steal joy... What is that? ...falls apart and reap your memories. I don't believe in witches, but if an old hag flies around on a broom stick... Please tell me we're having this conversation right now. - I thought I was going batshit. - Yeah, me, too. Now I know why the last bunch was so desperate to amscray. I mean, this place is... Haunted. Unless someone's got a better word for it. Look, before the Nazis come, we should, like, 23 skidoo. What is that? I... F... Y... O... U... "If you..." L... E... God! A-V... "If you leave..." Eugene, what the... What the fuck is happening? I'm not writing! I'm not writing! Ah! Fuck! If you leave, you'll die! What? It'd be nice if someone left something in these we can actually use. I'm gonna go padlock the front door and make them think that we abandoned the place. If they come in looking for food... not our first rodeo. Thanks. Okay, they're moving on. They're moving on. Fuck. - Damn it! - That son of a bitch. Grenade! Butchie, no! Eugene! - Chris! - Come on! Where are you? Chris, we need to cover! We need to cover from the back! He's not here! We're coming to get you. Where are you? Chris, where are you? Come fast! Out here! Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Shit! Fuck! No! This isn't real. This isn't real. Always gotta be the hero. How much morphine we have left? Enough to do the job... if we have to. Take this trash out with the rest of 'em. What the hell did you do? You wouldn't understand it. Strip him down and put him with the rest. What the hell does haunted even mean? Does that mean specific people have ghosts that are somehow anchored to the places they died? Or is it the places where evil's occurred that makes the portal to demonic forces? Or was evil simply a manmade concept in the first place? Will you give it a rest already? Look, evil is just... Well, it's what makes the violence so much fun. Everything we experienced, it's what what the Nazis did to the family that lived here. The Helwigs, despite their French royal lineage, were hiding Jews. So, the house fell into Nazi hands. And when the Nazis finally came, they smashed the doors down and the children ran and hid. But Mr. Helwig was found right here in the library. So, the Nazis tied him to a chair. Mrs. Helwig was hiding in the kitchen pantry. So they dragged her upstairs where they found her son hiding in the armoire in the attic. They drowned her boy in the upstairs bathtub and forced her to watch at gunpoint. They found the daughter hiding in the servants' quarters. Cristina. So they dragged her upstairs to the attic and hanged her from the rafters. They carried the screaming mom down to the library where they had soaked her husband in kerosene, laughing as they set him on fire. They tossed their bodies in a heap. No funerals, no headstones. Is that why they're, you know, still here? No Christian burial, that sort of thing? Wandering the Earth with unfinished business? I'm gonna go check on Butchie. It's all right, bro. Put it away. My father was a milkman. My mother was my dead mother now a memory. I always had a thing for scary movies. You know? Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy. I Was a Teenage Werewolf. Kids stuff. The scarier, the better. After Normandy, I've seen and... Done things. Did I ever tell you how I didn't sleep for five days when I marched through Stuttgart? Five days. They say it's not possible without losing your mind. I couldn't tell if I was dreaming or awake after three. And in my more lucid moments, I wondered if I was ever gonna get back to normal again. What I did to those Hitler Youth kids was a fucking nightmare. And I admit it, I got the control. I wanted to kill the eggs before they hatched. It was like floating above my body, looking down on myself when I cut that little blond boy's head off. It was like I wasn't doing it at all. I mean, I remember just... watching myself sitting there when that... that body just got up off the ground. Total insanity. Fever dream. And then he pulled a piece of string out of his pocket, that... body without a head, and... and he held his hands out and he made a cat's cradle, and... and what am I gonna do? I just cut... his fucking head off, Am I gonna be rude? So I played with him for a while. And then he just laid back down. I'm pretty sure it was... it was a dream. I was just... I was just too scared to move. So I sat there holding that cat's cradle for hours until you came and you found me with the bodies. I completely forgot that that ever happened. - Yesterday I reminded you. - Yeah. Kirk, you forgot to drain the tub. I'm here to help you. Let go! Hey. It's another dream, man. How much longer can you go without food? So what're we gonna do, Chris? No one wants to stay here another night. We'll be court-martialed for deserting our posts. Hey, Tap. Do you think you could find that Nazi truck again if you had to? I mean, it wouldn't matter. I slashed the tires. Maybe our relief will come soon. All right, Butch. The next bit is about quantum entanglement. Dullsville. "And then the Martian visitor explained that the deeds from one life "are carried with you into the next. "So reincarnation from Martians..." What are we looking for, anyway? I don't know. Memoirs, dairies, anything that really belonged to the Helwigs. Oh, fuck a duck. You got your Zippo? Yeah, upstairs. Studying German? You sure there isn't anything you wanna tell me? Is anyone down there? What's up? Get your asses up here now! This isn't real! This isn't real! This isn't real! This isn't real! This isn't real! This isn't real! This isn't real! This isn't real! - Where's the damn morphine? - This isn't real! - Eugene, morphine! - This isn't real! It's in the medical kit. This isn't real! It was us! It was us! It was us! It was us! It was us! - What was us? What was us? - It was us! It was us! Remember. Come downstairs. We need to talk. We're not staying another night. I'm not saying we abandon post, but maybe take a new position in the woods or something. Just frankly, my dear, fuck the court-martial. This place is bad juju. I think we should give him a proper burial. - Oh. - Send him off to heaven. Or the other place. Does the journal say where the bodies are dumped? Let me see the journal. I don't understand. No kidding. It's in German. You could barely order champagne in Paris. Does Dieter say where they put the bodies? I'll check, okay? But right now, let's get out of this house. And you're all willing to die in a military prison? Yes. I want everyone geared up and ready to clear out. Double time. All right. We better get our stories straight before we get to base camp. Like, "the German soldiers burned the castle down." That story ain't gonna seem so straight when they find the place in one piece. Maybe we should've torched it. Maybe it wouldn't let us. Do we keep going? We could, uh, flip a coin, I guess. You guys ever read An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge? The entire story takes place in the mind of the guy hanging from a noose? We're dead. Heaven fucking sucks. Unless it's the other place. Well, that's what they say, right? Hell is repetition? You know, most cultures have a version of hell where the dead relive their sins over and over for eternity. Just trapped in a loop. This ain't right, man. Let's just turn around. I just realized... I haven't taken a shit since I can remember. That's a classic pick-up line. Neither have I. For, like, weeks. That's not possible, right? No, it's not. Situation normal, all fucked up. Snafu, all right. Okay, I'm just gonna say what we're all thinking. If we march tomorrow and return... One day at a time. Like the drunk said. This ain't right, man. Let's just turn around. Maybe the compass is broken. Yeah, map, too. It won't let us leave. What if... What if we gave him a proper burial and all, like you said? Did the journal 20 the body dump? The last page was missing. We need to communicate with the spirits. Find out where the remains are. Are you baking them a cake? Footsteps. I want to see where they go. Vetrulek. Where'd you hear that word? Hmm? Vetrulek? It's just something that's been... ...floating around my head. Triple word score on that one. No, Dieter mentions that word. It's an old Muslim belief. Uh, "If you let evil happen, it could come back to haunt you tenfold." Like all that's required for evil to triumph is a good man do nothing. Yeah, but more like a curse. Why would Tappert know that word? What do you want? Guys, help! Guys, help! Shoot her! Fucking shoot her! Help! Help! - Shoot her! - Shoot what? Shoot her! Fucking shoot her! No! Flank left! Chris, we're coming in! One, two, three! They're here. What is it? It's the last page of the journal. Done. We should pray or something. This makes no sense. What? The Helwigs weren't French, they were Afghans. Yeah, this family, they hid dozens of Jews in the walls here, and spent a fortune providing them safe passage to America. They risked their lives collaborating against the Nazis for as long as they could. Since when do you know Arabic? What else does it say? Uh, just before she died, Mrs. Helwig performed the vetrul curse against the men who just stood by and watched. Just haunting them to the grave. Can we just focus on one fucking thing for two seconds? Let's finish it. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil... Court-martial my ass for all I care, as long as it's not here. Amen to that. Hey, give me a hand with this. Whoa! Slowly. Could be booby-trapped. Cigars? Locked in a trunk? Gotta be worth something. Whatever. Let's clear out in five. Hold on a second. Dieter mentions something about a trunk in his last entry, and once the Nazis opened it, his entries stopped. - What now? - It's, like, some of the words are different. Like, it... It says something new. What? That interring them only gave them power. Power for what? Power to bring them back from the dead. Break's over. This isn't real! This isn't real! Get off of me. Remember! Remember! This isn't real! This isn't real! This isn't real! This isn't real! This isn't real! Easy, son. Take it easy. It's all right. Relax. Two... Hold him down. Easy. Get away! Back off! Back off! - Get a grip. You stand down! - Get away! Stand down, son! Son, before you hurt someone, give me that. Ann, you pull him out. I don't want him going under like that again. Don't worry if you can't remember anything. That'll pass shortly. Where am I? You were flown to a special off-book facility. You remember your last day in Afghanistan, Lieutenant? Give it a sec. It'll come to you. Let's move! What's the situation? The asset's the blue-chip doctor for Islamic state's top brass. - Co-operating? - Yeah. Fed us sight intel on the last four high-value kills. Put his entire family at risk to help us, but he's been blown. Go for sent comm. So it's an extraction? The plan is to get his family to a safe house in Kabul, but there goes our information pipeline. Copy that. All the injuries to your squad were extreme. You were far too critical for the Kandahar trauma center. The mind is a very powerful healing tool, but when pressed by the awareness of paralysis and amputation, it can simply shut down and die. Our computer simulation is designed to help soldiers recover from their post-traumatic stress as they heal from their injuries. Where's Butchie? Why can't I remember? I'm sorry. It's not supposed to happen like this. Like what? Okay. Playing cat's cradle, huh? You see this? I was going to give this to my boy. You want it? Your hands are tied. You want that? There. Hey, Paul. - As-Salaam-Alaikum. - Wa-Salaam-Alaikum, Paul. Please join us. Doctor. Is this everyone? Yellow-six, stand by with the van. What's wrong? That day we hoped would never come? Your name keeps coming up on the cyber chatter. What? What happened? You promised to protect us! I know, and I'm sorry, but look, you don't even have time to pack. Just get your children, get your passports and meet us outside in two minutes. - Let's move. - Echo 11, abort mission. - What? - Got three incoming land bogeys cutting off all major arteries. You got about 30 seconds to find cover. Command jacked into NATO satellite, ISIS forces are coming in from all sides. Three vehicles. Put us in the wall. What? ISIS is coming, and they're blocking our escape. Put us in the wall. - Hide. - Come, please. It is this way. Here, here, here. Cristina! Inside! Keep dreaming, man. Extraction is now impossible. We wait for the hajis and let the drones track 'em back to the big brass. CDE can put eyes, we're ahead in five. - Move! - Fuck that, I'm not going in there. You don't have a goddamn opinion until I give you one! What about protecting the family? Get in the fucking wall! Now! Fuck. Come on. Come on. You have to hide. Come on. Get in! Go! Shh. You're done. Drones are locked. Nobody move. See you at my court-martial. We were never here. With all respect, fuck you, sir. You got eyes on 'em? Do not lose them. Bomb! Oh, God. Oh, God. We should have helped them. We could have saved them before it was too late. And what about this guys, they're still in France? Why did you guys put us in a fucking war at all? World War II scenario has been the most effective for linking like-minded soldiers with purpose, with brotherhood. something the sim just can't create by itself. For six weeks, you all were thriving. Making miraculous recoveries, despite your conditions, especially in the mind. A few days ago, Butchie Martinsen woke from an induced coma for reasons we don't understand. And when he saw his body, he just simply shut his eyes and he died. Which he tried to tell us. This isn't real. - Phantom itch. - You have an itch? No, in the sim. Kirk was always scratching his feet. And the Morse Code we heard, was a message from... us. "I have no legs." That was our subconscious mind telling us what we couldn't see for ourselves. And, "you leave, you die." Not a threat but a warning about the sim. You sent subliminal messages to yourself, that's... - That's incredible. - Yeah, and dangerous. There's gotta be a way to shut that down. More CTZ to the frontal lobe. Your sim is haunted, you know. There's a ghost in the machine. Or a computer virus, or a programmer with a fuck ton of issues, unless it's supposed to feel like you're in a horror movie. - How so? - That's not part of the program? Sticking in avatars of previously engaged combatants? - Reliving old missions? - God, no. The simulation is meant to be benign. World War II was chosen because it would trigger fewer real-world memories. What about the word "vetrulek"? What? You all whispered that word at one time or another. The Internet says it's a Muslim curse. What the hell is that? We brought the Helwigs into the sim with us. We brought them to life, gave them power. But the program... None of it's real. It's real when you're fucking in it! The prayers, everything. Get an evac team down here immediately. - You gotta put me back in there. - No, I'm gonna sedate them. - 20mls Propofol. - Put me back in, I can save them. We were blind to what we did to them. They tried to show us but we couldn't see. Just look for yourself. Were my memories in Afghanistan supposed to be there? Okay, I'll put you back. - But what will you do? - We need to face what we did. Atone for our sins before it's too late. Do it. Okay. Initiating promotion sequence. Simulator engaged. Memory suppression complete. - Wait, Chris! - In 10... - Your memory will be wiped. - Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five... Four... Three... Two... One. What do you want?
