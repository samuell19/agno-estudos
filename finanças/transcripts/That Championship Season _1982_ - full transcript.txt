Hello, testing. Bob, can you hear me? Could the Scranton High School band please report to the bandstand? How much time till we start? Should be two minutes. The senior citizens have the first 20 rows. Okay, guys, you've got to move back. Ladies and gentlemen introducing the Scranton Technical High School cheerleaders. M-A-Y-O-R! Mayor Sitkowski! He's our man! S-I-T-K-0... W-S-K-I! Thank you. We're all fighting back, aren't we? I love this city. You know why I love this city? Why? Because I love the people of this city. I was born here. Right over there in West Scranton, that's where! Enough promises, enough Sitkowski. Vote for Norman Sharmen. Remember, the future is now. I don't know how many of you remember, but 22 years ago today a man stood right here in this park... ...and he asked you for three things. He asked you for your hand... ...he asked you for your help, and he asked you for your vote. And that man was John Fitzgerald Kennedy. I'm not here today to ask you for any of those things. No, sir. Even though the election's just a month away, no politics today. And that's a promise! Because today... I got a little surprise for you. Is it a check, George? I come with a gift. How about a job? A gift to everybody in this city. A gift to all the kids in this city from 8 to 80. A gift from me. A gift from my council. A gift for you. So, without anymore ado... ...with a lot of humility... ...and with a great deal of love... ...we give you... Tilly. Great idea. Tilly! Isn't she a beautiful elephant? Yes, she's got a beard. What about the right eye? Does the right eye look even? Yeah! I don't know, James. You really think the right eye looks even? It's even, George, believe me! The ears are even. The ears are perfect! It's all perfect. I love it. It works. You know, I'll tell you something. It's got style. It really does. Better than you-know-who's. Absolutely. I mean, it's impressive. It dominates the whole street! What time is Tom getting in? 3:00 bus. Phil's picking him up. God, I can't wait to see your brother. I love him. What a wonderful surprise for the Coach. It's great. It's gonna knock him on his ass. You are a maniac! Take a look. Smart. Nice. We got a problem. What's that mean? It means the elephant died this morning. Tilly? Yeah, they just called. Lived one week, George. Died from what? Combination of peanuts and senility. Who knows? How did I know it was sick? I'm the Mayor, not a veterinarian. All right, City Hall. Boys. Tony. Gentlemen. Welcome, Sabu, to our camp. You dog. You voted for the elephant. We all thought we were getting a live elephant. There's an attempt at humor. That was funny. The media will think it's hysterical. So will Sharmen. What are you worried about? I've got the newspapers covered. And Sharmen. Yeah? Why didn't you buy a parrot? You could bury it in a shoebox. Did I tell you? I told you. We're getting our money back. How? I'm having an autopsy performed. On an elephant? You're a nutcase. I don't care if they got to climb up its ass with a searchlight. These people are going to prove to us, once and for all, that it was defective before we ever bought it. I told you. What is this, "I told you," Marelli? Are you a parrot? Forget it. We got to get rid of it. Burn it. It's against the health laws. Right, let's eat it. Funny. No, we'll have an elephant roast for the senior citizens. This is the sixth emergency meeting we've called this month because of your shenanigans. Have the solution. Yes? I think we're gonna have to stuff it and put it in the museum. Don't start that, please. What's up, fellas? Bury it! Give the elephant the biggest funeral this city's ever had. He's got it. That's the best thing you've said since you've been on the city council. We give him a High Mass, the Bishop's blessing, and a 21-gun salute! This is ridiculous. I have the solution. We take it to my strip mine and drop it down an abandoned mine shaft. Nobody knows. That's it. Brilliant. Did I tell you? I told you. Romano always comes up with the answers. Now you've got it. Pretty goddamn smart for an Italian. Envy is a mortal sin, Macken. The man employs 200 people. Yeah, I know. But you, George, I'm telling you, you're in trouble. And it's the last time you make us look like the village idiots. Number 12 on your scorecard, but number one in your heart... Tom Daley! How are you, Phil? We missed you. Missed you, too. But you made it back for the 24th. God, you look wonderful. Come on, give me that. Can you handle that? I don't know. So, what's been happening? We keep pushing the rock up the hill. And it keeps rolling back down. Now you've got it. When did they close this place? Three years ago. Your brother will be so thrilled to see you. I'm looking forward to seeing him. George wants to turn this into a museum. Why not? George is a dreamer. So good to see you. It's good to see you, Phil. This your car? Yeah, suits me, doesn't it? Still Cadillac, Phil? Two points. Where're we going? A funeral. A what? You won't believe it. Madge, get me Ed McCain at the Herald. I told you I wanted your class preparation sheets on my desk... at the end of the day, every day. It's not a union requirement. To hell with the union. It's my requirement. Let's take it up with the union then. Let's take it up with me. Mr. Nelson, you're a teacher... ...and you're a coach. There's no place in our profession for mediocrity. Mediocrity meaning low excellence. Are you saying that I'm mediocre? I'm saying that you're a lazy, uninspiring lout. I want those class preparation sheets on my desk this afternoon. Got it? Hi, Ed. Listen, can you get over to the mayor's office around 4:00? You're gonna hear from my union. Take a hike. No, not you, Ed. It's not too important, but I think it's something worth your while. By the way... ...how's your cousin Pauly doing? Yeah? Where is he? Better keep an eye on him. The mayor will see you over there at 4:00. Bye-bye. Reggie. Every time the man throws a high inside fastball he's doing them nothing but a favor. Called it again, George. You can do us a favor. Especially me, Eddie. Squash the elephant pictures, don't run them in the paper. I don't think I can, George. It's election time. It's news. What, you don't think arson's news? How many times do I have to remind you about your cousin Pauly, the arsonist? Come on, you don't have to bring that up. Why not? You're hitting me with elephant pictures. The man torched his building, Eddie, and was caught. But I squashed it, didn't I? Got him out of town. Saved your sister a lot of grief. This is a little blackmail, George. No. Not blackmail. Welcome to the arena of politics. Hello, I'm Norman Sharmen, and I'd like to speak to you. I'm really uncomfortable with this man in my office. I promise to turn this magnificent, but empty building into the most beautiful mall in Pennsylvania. Remember... You mean to tell me the people of this city want that turd for their mayor? The preceding was a paid political... To tell you the truth, I really don't know, George. Here. Now you're talking. God, what a wonderful idea it was. Good. Bring it a little bit more to your right. No, your other right. Angelo, listen to me. That's right. Good. Now move it forward, so you can center it. Bring it up. No! What are you... No! Here's a little piece of advice. Don't ever hire your relatives. Angelo, right. Now bring it forward. Okay, now bring it out further. Come on, pay attention, Angelo. Further. We're not going to swing it all day. We're going to drop it, Angelo. I want you to move it to the right, and I want you to center it. That's better. Phil, we've got company. You are on my property! This is city property. Leased it, moron! You and the Polack are done. Buried. Sharmen's going to whip your ass! Come on, we'll shoot it anyway. This is Tom Harrison with News Scene. Welcome to another fiasco... Angelo, center it! Now drop it! Tilly was approximately 83 years old. He missed. Okay, here's your key. George is going to pick you up at 7:00. Thanks a lot, Phil. The 24th. I'll see you at the Coach's. Have a nice time. Hi. Hi. Could you do me a favor? Sure, gladly. Could you put this in my room, please? Room 310. Did you look at this? Sharmen's all over town. Why don't we call him by his right name? Sharmowitz. The only thing a Jew changes more often than his politics is his name. Mr. Sharmowitz just might make it a close race. You bet he might. Did you talk to Marion? Yeah. She came up last week to talk to me about a campaign contribution. And? We ought to run her. She's very smart. Marion's my conscience, and my severest critic. She also understands the political scene a hell of a lot better than I do. So, you're in for a rough campaign this time? Boy, you know it. And we're broke, out of money. Is that true? Yeah. You still writing? Why do you ask? Well, you're looking at a man who desperately needs a speechwriter. Let me think about it. Bye-bye, Jumbo. It figures. South Scranton. Here's the real story: James and I worked it out so Phil gets to keep the strip mines that he's leased from the city. Put that on the TV. Should I plug it in? Yeah. Sharmen wants to break the lease. Mr. Sharmen, it seems, is some kind of ecology nut. If he gets elected you're not going to be able to piss in your own toilet. How's the Coach? Terrific. Operation was a complete success. Ulcerated stomach, and that was it. Where is the Coach, George? He said he'd meet us here about 8:00. You know, Phil's holding back. I sent Marion up last week about some more money... because we're broke... and he stalled it, if you can believe that. The Coach and I... ...we got a little info that's gonna knock Phil right on his ass. Want a drink? Later. It's only 5:00. 5:00? It's almost 8:00. 1 drink on Pacific Coast time. So I'm three hours behind everybody else. You little bastard. Still a very quick little guy. How's James? He's terrific. My right arm. After I'm reelected... I'm going to have him appointed Superintendent of Schools. He's a valuable man, your brother. That's patronage, George. Hey, is there any other way? Phil hasn't changed. Gave me a big hug and kiss at the station. Italians are like that, can't keep their hands off you. What's air pollution? What? Five hundred Italian paratroopers. What has an 1Q of 100, George? Poland. Remember? I'm Polish. I love Polish jokes. You know how a Polack ties his shoe, don't you? Come on in the kitchen, help me with the chicken. It's amazing. Nothing's really changed here. Absolutely nothing. You know what would make tonight really memorable? Yeah. If Martin were to come walking through that door. Magic, wasn't he? Unbelievable. Who knows, maybe next year for the 25th. Maybe. You bastards. What? Remember when you put wintergreen in my jock strap? I swear, I had nothing to do with that. It was you and him. What, are you kidding? My balls were on fire for a week! Those were the days, my friend We thought they'd never end Here they come. I can't wait till I see the look on your brother's face. Well, my oldest boy Mike is going to be over 6 " 3". I wanted to send him to USF, but the program was cancelled. Did you go to Moosic to get the beer? Is Tommy here? He's in the kitchen. Where's the Coach? He'll be here about 8:00. I think he's got something up his sleeve. What? His arm. Number 12 on your scorecard. But number one in your heart. Hey, Tommy. How are you, brother? Fantastic. It's good to see you. Why didn't you call? You could've stayed at the house. No, Phil set me up at the German Hotel. It's okay. You look great. You, too. Doesn't he look fantastic? Yes. Best playmaker in the state. Phil, did you bring your dirty movies? The man has pornographic movies. Tommy and I love him, but I should arrest him. Arrest me. I rent them from your brother-in-law, the Chief of Police. Yes, the Police Department is a library for stag films. It's free enterprise. A man can sell what he confiscates. How do you think I raised money for the little league fund? I rented the VFW, charged $5 a head. Showed Olga's Massage Parlor, and selected shorts. Give me a minute, boys, I'll be right down. Here he is. You stay there. We want to surprise him. Why don't you put a ribbon around me? All right, shape it up! Fall in. Twenty laps around the court! Too much fat around the ass. Twenty laps. I want my boys lean and mean. Romano, you hit those boards hard. And you, Sitkowski, get the lead out and move. And you, James Daley, defense! Defense! The old gunner can still bray with the best of them, can't he? Hey, Coach, take a look. That's a grand gift, boys. What a wonderful thought. Toshiba. No shit. Those Japs can really do it, huh? I'm ready, Coach. Put me in. Now, that's the grandest gift of all. Where the hell have you been? That's a fine gift. Come on, let's take a walk. You look great, Coach. I feel good. He wants you to put him in. That's because he can't get in on his own. Wait, I'll get the camera. I just can't find the words to say it. My boys standing around me again. You haven't changed in 20 years. I won't change in 20 more. I can still run you to the ground... after having my belly cut open. Twenty stitches. Belly looks like a baseball. Let's have a look. Come on. Stay in shape. You boys are in your 40s now. That's the heart attack season. Lean and mean. Hold it right there, gents. Hold it right there. Great. Got it. I got me one of those exercise bikes. Keeps my stomach flat. Yeah, but your ass is still around your knees! How do you feel, James? I feel great, Coach. Except my teeth. Having some trouble. Teeth? Yeah, I got a partial plate the other day. You never did have enough vitamin C in your diet. Try feeding five kids. You didn't feed them your teeth, did you? You know, they recently proved that nerves can severely damage your teeth. Maybe you should've gotten your nerves out. That's good. I used to tell people that you were like a fine watch. My very fine, expensive watch that kept perfect time. Seventy-seven, seventy-six. I'm proud of you. Climbing to the top of your professions. Business, politics, education... ...travel. Well, sir, there's only one man I know who's responsible for it. Oh, no, not me. You did it all yourselves. Best advice I ever gave you: "Get yourselves a name.”" Remember? "Run to win." Hi, Coach. How you feeling? Hello, Frank. Good. How you doing, Frank? That's right, "Run to win." St. Paul said that. A saint. "Run always to win." "Healthy minds and healthy bodies." The Greeks said that, boys. They started it all. Great athletes, the Greeks. Magnificent. The Greeks were pederasts. What? Come on. He means the Greeks were homosexuals. The Greeks? Homos? Romans maybe. Not the Greeks. No, that's liberal bullshit. I don't believe it. I won't listen to it. Lost again. He's still gonna win 20 this year. It looks like the Celtics are gonna win it, all right. But they lost Archibald. Right, and The Bird is the best player in the league. He just had a bad series. Choked up? Absolutely. You fox. You're taking us to the old school. She's 80 years old, boys. Jesus. What a relic. Okay! You cheated. Nine seconds. Not bad at all. I'm not in as good shape as I used to be. Pretty damn good. Come on. Here she is, boys. When did they close it down? Right after the railroad station. I'm gonna open her up again. You've got enough keys. That's a little joke from your brother. Looks smaller. That's because you got bigger. I speak for democracy. Seven seconds to go. Down by one point. Unbelievable. I passed the ball and bounced to Tom. I brought it across. Passed it to me in the corner. Six seconds. I hit James, coming across. saw Martin. Hitting the foul line! Martin caught the ball in midair, and he went straight up. Up. One second. You were a legend in your time, boys. A legend. Never forget that. Coach this is just great. Really special. The jerseys are for your grandchildren. What a beautiful thought. Look at that. They belong to you, boys. Coach, I can't fit into this anymore. I want you to have them. Thanks a lot, Coach. Here, let's get a picture. You were a thing of rare beauty. Life is a game... ...and I'm glad to say... ...that I've played it with the best. Gentlemen... ...a toast... ...to the 1957 Pennsylvania High School basketball champions. Hear, hear. You were one flesh 24 years ago. Don't you forget that as long as you live. You know, I'm prouder of that... ...than I am of being Mayor of this city. Fast. You were a flash of legs. Gone like lightning. You remember that 8-foot nigger who jumped like a kangaroo? Sure. They said we couldn't do it. We beat a school five times our size, and we beat them in Philadelphia. Did the impossible, boys. Don't you ever forget that. Martin. Jesus, what a great eye. Priceless. The man was the perfect ball player. He made it all go. Magnificent talent. Not a word in 24 years. Boys, let's say a little prayer for Martin. Wherever he is, let's pray that he's safe and happy... ...and still a champion. Amen. Never had a losing season. Not many can say that. Sharmen won't be able to say that, will he, Coach? He'll see politics played like he's never seen it before. We'll run him right off the court. Right, squeeze the Sharmen. You know, he attacked me. I'm not prejudiced, but the Jew attacked me in print. Well, he is running against you, George. How about such a thing as respect for the office? You know what he said in the paper? He said that Phil and I were corrupt. Can you believe that? Why, you little bastard. You were a great forward. And I'm a great Mayor. I have given this town four very memorable years. And you'll give them four more. "Never settle for less than success." Teddy said that, boys. They carved that man's face into a mountain. They don't make Teddys anymore. A man among men. A giant. Just walked in and took Panama away from the Spics. I'll drink to that. Doesn't he look wonderful? You can't keep the old gunner down. We ought to put him to work. That's it. You got it. Boys, say hello to my next speechwriter. Now, come on, George. I told you I'd think about it. We need something. A miracle or something. What does that mean, Phil? It means we've got problems. Who? You. Us. What's he talking about? Coach, tell the man how popular I am. Let's hear Phil. Don't overestimate your strengths, George. Wait a minute, boys. I'm putting this town back on its feet. Four percent increase in property tax, you're lucky you weren't hung. When we took over, this city was broke. Well, the city is still broke. ( N axes raised every year. ) Are you trying to tell me that the working man's not behind me? I'm only reciting history. We had a garbage strike for five weeks. The city smelled like a whorehouse. We're in a depression, not a recession. That's a fact. How about last week in the park? There were people there. How many? At least 1,000. Cheering me. Now that's popularity. I'm extremely popular, Phil. Georgie, they were waiting to see the new elephant. I bought the goddamn thing. And it died, George. Died? Christ. When? Today. We buried it in Phil's mineshaft. It hurt your image. People are calling you Sabu. I have a fantastic image in this town. I'm the one that inherited the 22 percent unemployment. Let's not forget that. This is the unemployment capital of the world. I need a little time. Go ahead, thrash it out, boys. Have another drink, George. This city's safe, I'll tell you that. There're no niggers mugging in my city streets. The last nigger here was Joe Louis. And he was passing through. James, one rape in four years? A couple of murders. How about that? We're not even certain she was raped. Who? You remember the girl... You remember that girl with the guy with the glass eye... Mike Kaminski. She claimed he assaulted her, and forced perverted acts, that he performed cunnilingus on her. What? Cunnilingus. Oral sex. The male performing an oral act on a woman. Jeez, that's a fancy name for it. If that's a perversion, I should be in a cage. Let's not get away from the subject. I'm talking about dissension. I sense some dissension here. This country's hurting, Phil. We've got to pull together. Teamwork. There're dangerous times all over. Thousands of towns like ours. We fire the furnace, keep it all going. But no dissension. We stick together. Get me a drink, will you? Yeah. Come on, where's that camera? I'd like to get a picture around the trophy. Coach? What the hell's the matter? You all right? Let's go home. How long since the operation? Month. It was about five weeks ago. He's like a boy. He overdid it. Yeah, he overdid it. He's sick. That man is the best. He just popped a couple of stitches, that's all. What about his doctor? He doesn't need a doctor, he just needs another one of these. Just popped a couple of stitches. He's fine. He'll be all right, Tom. He overdid it. Twenty-fourth. How's Claire, Phil? She's great. She just took up tennis. She's going to be young forever. How about the kids? Fabulous. What, is Amanda about 12 now? Yeah, she's 12. She just had her confirmation. You should have seen her in the white dress. I cried. You cry about everything. You sure do. Tommy? Thanks. What a night. Philly, what are we gonna do about Sharmen? The better question might be, what are we gonna do about George? What are you talking about? Why are you so down on George? Four years ago, he beat that old alcoholic we had by 32 votes. The Coach won it for him, remember? Yeah, I'm aware of that, Phil. Sharmen has IBM ready to come in here tomorrow morning. And the railroad station into a mall is a classy idea. I know, but George can attract industry. He is busy trying to save a bunch of useless buildings. The future's here. Now. George can win. I know he can. People want change. Sharmen is young. George is like Bugs Bunny on television. "This is the mayor. What's up, folks?" I love the guy, but we've got Looney Tunes for a Mayor. Is that the only reason you're against him? Isn't that enough? I thought it might be because you're having an affair with his wife. Oh, Christ. Who told you? Nobody. But it could easily become common knowledge. That's a rumor. Come on, Phil, don't deny it. She never got over me since high school. Good old Marion. I hope she's improved with age. That's not funny. I know all about Marion. Not what she'd want with me. Just listen to me for a second. You keep this thing going with Marion, and we are all in big trouble. She's not very stable, you know. She was a great girl. That may be. Listen, if Sharmen wins this election, you lose your lease with the city. You know what that spells? Complete business disaster. Don't you think I know that? You need George as much as he needs you. Sharmen speaks English. He can be talked to. Joey, come on in, it's 9:00. Jesus, you'd do that to us, Phil? You would actually jump to Sharmen? Politics is another way of making money. Sharmen's like any other politician. Hey, listen, Philly. I don't care about your personal life unless it endangers the entire... You are in this for what you can get. A piece of the action. Don't shit me. George is all we've got right now. And he may not be enough. But not tonight. It's a party. The 24th. Look at that broccoli. My old man would have loved that. Tommy! Ball! The Coach is fine. He'll be right down. Sorry. Hard to get the rhythm without Martin. Just need a little practice. Here you go. James, tell them my new campaign slogan. Not now, George. Come on. "The Romance Continues." Original, George. Never hurt Rocky. I admit it's expensive. Saturate all the local stations, billboards. Let's not talk about it tonight. Let's talk about it later. Come on, it's a whole new image for me. Are you kidding? A grassroots guy, no egghead. Dynamic shots. Thank you. And I'm dynamite on television. Let's talk about it tomorrow. What's the matter with you? What about him? He's got some serious doubts about us. Doesn't think we can beat Sharmen. Is that true? I've got doubts. That's just because you don't know the hot piece of news we got last week. What are you talking about? Ace in the hole. You know, Coach and I did a little research, found out... Norman Sharmen had an uncle who was a Communist. It was in the New York Times. June 5, 1951, Hollywood. A blacklisted writer. Old news, he's probably dead. He is. That can't hurt Sharmen. Really? With a résumé like that in this town, he's a dead man. What about that chicken? It's not in the oven yet. Why didn't you tell me about this? I was gonna tell you. Why didn't you? Phil, seriously, how do you feel about this Commie in Sharmen's family? Times have changed. Nobody cares about Communists. That makes it a new ball game. Come on. What are you talking about? Let's face it, the man's uncle did a year in jail. Listen, guys, it's not 1950. McCarthy's dead. George, would you mind putting the chicken in the oven? What do you want it set at? Medium-high. Remember one thing, Philly. George has taken very good care of you. I paid for it. My money got him elected last time. There's more to it than that. You know it. Is there? Yeah, there is. You know, Philly, you got it made. You drive a classy car every year, and you wear beautiful $800 suits. My suit cost me $100. I've been driving the same car for the last 10 years. I don't mind. I've got five kids. One of them is a genius, maybe. But I don't want to be swallowed up in anonymity. I want to do something important in my life, because I feel I'm a talented man. I'm working hard for this guy because number one: I believe in him, and number two: I want what's coming to me. I want my share. You two guys fucked up. Share that. Come on, Phil, how can you say that? What's the next step, Philly? Lunch with Sharmen? You son of a bitch. Just a few drinks, a couple of deals. You're really good at that, making arrangements... Come on, Jim. That's not nice. Really? What is nice about betrayal, I ask you? Because that's what we're talking about, George. Nothing less. Right, Phil? Go away, James. Don't you understand? No, don't talk to me. Just take a walk. Wait a second. We're friends, aren't we? You think he's your friend? I do. Then you are really stupid. Almost as stupid as this dumb wop. Can I help it if you belong on welfare? You are a thick, ignorant wop. And you are a shanty Irish asshole! Christ's sake! What are you guys doing? He's fucking your wife. That's why he won't support you. That's not why I won't support... What did he say? You're doing what with my wife? We had a thing. It just happened. With Marion? Come on, George. But my wife is... Oh, my God. God almighty. You stupid dago bastard. You prey on people, Phil. You hurt people. You ought to be wiped away like a dirty stain. Turn around. You don't move anywhere. How does that feel, Phil? George, put the gun down. Scary, isn't it? Come on. Put the gun down, George. What's going on here? What's happened? George, don't lose your poise, boy. Just give me the gun. Be a man, and give me the gun. It's all right. Okay? Easy, boy. Get some Scotch, James. Easy. I couldn't even shoot you. You've got a load of tension in you, boy. Take some deep breaths. I'm all right. Come on, breathe deeply. Maybe he should do some pushups, Coach, or run in place. Tom, why don't you pick up the jerseys and take them in the trophy room? Sit down, James. Phil, you sit down, too. Tommy, come on back in here, will you? All right, let's get to the bottom of this. What happened between you and Phil? It's a private thing. There's been nothing private between the people in here for 25 years. Now, what's the problem? Phil is... -...or apparently, has had... -Wait. Coach, I had this thing... Wait a minute, I'll tell it. It is my wife, if you don't mind. That makes it my story, right? Old friend, great guy. You prick! I'm all right. I'm calm. Phil's having an affair with my Marion. Your Marion? James just announced it to the whole room. James, why didn't you tell me about this? I just found out tonight. I saved this man's business, trusted him, my friend. You dago... Easy! Get some air, George. Someday, Phil. Take him out on the porch, James. Is this true, Phil? Why didn't you tell me? Everybody knew it. I didn't know. You did, too, know! You're a liar! It's over. We had a thing. It just happened. I don't know about those things. I never laid my friend's wife! You're just an old whore, that's what you are! A diseased old whore! Enough! You're pussy-whipped, boy. Get some discipline. You think with your cock, and it'll ruin you quicker than Sharmen. Goddamn it! People are being hurt. Did she tell you that you were the best? Tell your old buddies. You sex maniac! Get him in here. Was my wife a good lay? What's wrong with you? It's none of your business. Just sit down and relax. Come on in, James. Phil, come here and sit down. Here, you got a drink? Thank you. Thanks. Gentlemen, to 1957. I'd like to say something. I'm sorry things happened the way they did, but I thought the truth would bring us all together. That's fine, James. Now, Phil, let's hear it from the beginning to the end. She was there one day in my office. When? A couple of weeks ago. She came to see me about a campaign contribution. She went to see all the businessmen in this community. I wonder how much she raised. Come on now, Tommy, I'm warning you. We talked, we had a few drinks. It just happened, Coach. Right there in the office? It's a private office, George. On the floor? I have a couch in there. And? I asked her if she wanted to... Fuck. The word is "fuck." Come on, get on with the story. Then she said, "Yeah." Christ, Marion never struck me as a whore. Come on, Coach! Give me a break! I'm just trying to establish who made the first advance. We talked, we had a few drinks. It just happened. I see. You doubled her drinks... got her hot on booze and memories, and humped her on the floor. The couch! Goddamn it! If you turn on each other, you don't stand a chance. The woman is not a whore. Nobody said she was! You need each other, boys. Need. I don't need him. If there's one thing I cannot stand, it's ignorance. It disgusts me. He took advantage of my wife! She hasn't been the same since the baby. Booze and women. I've tried to protect you from it. I got you the Jesuits, got scholarships for you... got the Jesuits to teach you boys. I graduated from the Jesuits in three years. They all wanted me to become a Jesuit. My father used to say, "The Jesuits are the scholars of the church." Teaching the game was not just a profession with me. It was a vocation, like a priest. I devoted my life to excellence... to superiority. So don't come apart before my very eyes. Not in front of me, because you boys are my real trophies. Never forget that. Never. I think every man in this room realizes that, Coach. Never take less than success. Now that's a philosophy of life, boys. Not a slogan, a philosophy. We have an election coming up. We're going to win it by the rules. Pride, loyalty, teamwork. No other way. None. Beat that Jew! Beat that Jew! Go Gentiles! You're ridiculous. You know that? I'm absurd, are you kidding? Why don't you take a walk? I did. Three years ago. I know, but you came back. George, do you want to win this campaign? I don't need him. I didn't ask you that. Asked you if you wanted to win. Yes, sir. Then you have to pay the price. What price? Pain. The price is pain. This pain in my stomach has been there all my life. You endure pain to win. It's a law of life. There's no other way. It's good to hurt. The mind overcomes pain. All right, Phil, we're all waiting for your answer. I'm telling you, public opinion wants George back in the insurance business. No, public opinion is changed every day. I expect nothing will be settled without consulting me. The New York Times said that Sharmen's uncle took the Fifth Amendment 11 times. That makes Sharmen very vulnerable. Things have changed today. Nothing changes but the dates. Exploiting a man's weakness is the name of the game. If he can't move to the left, left him to death. If he can't stop a hook, hook away at him. Find his weak spot and go after him. Punish him with it. I've drilled that into you a thousand times. Why smear him with this Communist thing? You think that kike wouldn't use Marion against us? Wave her at us like a dirty flag? Maybe he wouldn't. He took the Fifth Amendment 11 times. Will you please get in here? For Christ's sake! I've lived my whole life on the Fifth Amendment, and so have you. It's bullshit! He's loaded. Bullshit! He's loaded. Everybody along the line has used the Fifth Amendment sometime. I know, but there was a Communist... You know, the Jesuits would be pissed at you. I expect nothing will be settled without consulting me. It breaks my heart to see him fall apart like that. Can't you people understand that if I lose that business, I'm nothing? It's too late. There's no way left to start over. In case you're interested, I am, Sharmen's spot is coming on any second. Good evening, I'm Debbie Dunleavy. And I'm Tom Powell. New fighting has broken out in the Mideast. More developments to report on the economic front. From the state capital comes word of new money for regional highway construction. And the local political scene is heating up. Hello, I'm Norman Sharmen. Mayor Sitkowski has given you this: The 12th playground in the last two years. That's very good. That's very impressive. But Mayor Sitkowski has also given you this. The Romano Strippings. How the hell did he get up there? Harrison. That's his stuff. That's 22's stuff. And yes, the unpleasant speculation of corruption. I promise you, the taxpayers of this city to expose the true relationship between the mayor of this city, and a man who is committing, to my mind, a criminal act. He brought advertising people in from New York. And I promise you I know. ...that when I'm elected Mayor... I will not look the other way while a greedy businessman devastates the natural beauty of our land. Remember, the future is now. How much do you guys need for a television spot like that? $25,000. Why don't you offer Sharmen the $25,000? Take a hike, James. That's a good idea. Why don't you call him up? Come on. Call him, right here in front of all of us. Okay, good. 935-8220. How come you know his number? I know everything, Philly. Norman, this is the number-one threat to the environment. Right, Phil Romano. Listen, I'm gonna come right out and say it. I like your style. It's all politics, right? I'd like to talk to you about your campaign. Everybody needs contributions, right? I've been known to make a few. Money's tight. No. You scratch my back, I scratch yours. It's that simple. Yeah, but... Is that so? Really? Let me ask you this, Norman. How's your uncle, the Communist? You won't be laughing so hard when you read about it in the newspapers. Okay, you listen to me, you kike bastard, because... It's his cousin, not his uncle. It's all right. It's still in the family. We can still use it. He laughed at me. You made me blow it, James. I made you blow it? Listen, if I wasn't your friend... My money made my friends. Don't shit me. No goddamn monkey is gonna blow us off our own court. Politics is not basketball. We can't sit around here fingering the past. Listen, I think we ought to go easy on Sharmen being Jewish. It could be labeled anti-Semitism. Nobody's anti-anything. There's good and bad in every race, James. Some of the greatest athletes in the world were Jews. Sid Luckman, magnificent. Nobody could punch pound-for-pound like Barney Ross. Jesse Owens, alone he beat the goddamn Germans. Splendid nigger. Fast as the wind. But as a rule, you gotta watch them. Can't trust them. Jews, the same. Coach, I'd like to talk to you alone. My friends, "In the kingdom of the blind..." Tommy! Oh, God! Jesus! Tommy, you all right? Tommy, can you hear me? "...the one-eyed man is king." He's all right. Put him over here on the couch. I'm okay. Right here. There you go. None of you can hold your liquor. You drink like women. You'll be squatting to piss next. Come on, Phil, let's go in the office. I don't trust Phil. Something's happening. Something's going on. Let the Coach handle it. Why not? He's handled everything else. What's happened to him? I don't know. Happened to me? "Fuck you and the horse you rode in on," as our old grandmother used to say. I love you, George. How's the little woman? Hey, that is not nice. He's a mess. Why don't we stone her? Jesus. No, James, that's an old Jewish custom. What are you doing? Don't do that, James. Give me that goddamn... Hey, listen to me! I don't want you to drink any more tonight. Do you understand me? Yes, you're right, James. Drinking in moderation is murder. Please, Tommy. The Coach is trying to convince Phil to back us. That's all. The question is, will you accept the money? Would you accept it if it were Helen? Come on, George. What do you mean, "Come on, George"? I asked you a question. Would you accept it? Yeah, but I'm not in any such situation. You've got an imagination, don't you? Can't you use your imagination? Pretend? Pretend you're me. Pretend that... ...your best friend... ...a boy you grew up with a boy you were champions together with was... ...is... ...with your wife. Would you accept the money then? No. Wait a minute. I might accept part of it. Part of it? No, I would accept all of it. I'd accept all the money. You would? Yeah. The Jesuits would be pissed at both you guys. You are nothing but cheap cynicism and booze. Let's not do my biography tonight, James. I saved your life, and I'm trying to save what's left of mine. So will you please just stay out of it? I can't. You won't let me. Oh, God. I carried him all my life. I carried everybody. I'm exhausted. I'm only 43. But you never did anything... ...out of love, James. You're just obedient. You're an obedient man. No one's listening. No one ever does. I lose myself behind all the... handshakes, and the speeches... and the smiles. I don't think that I'm the man... ...that I wanted to be. I know one thing. I love Scranton. You know, George... I've been thinking. Marion may have done this whole thing for you... ...for the money. For the money. Why? To support you, to help you. She's always been devoted to your career. It's entirely possible. It's been done before. She's never been the same since... In the hospital... ...it looked like something that floats. It was freakish. It was a boy. He had blue eyes. We never even named it. We just... ...put it away. What else could you do? She was heartbroken. A child like that makes a bad reflection. A mongoloid. It wasn't real good for the old image. You lose the mongoloid vote, hands down. Shut up. Seriously. Marion may have used Phil for you. I want you to think about it, really. You may be right. I think she helped him out of plain old lust, George. You see what he does to me? Me, his brother. Me, who went to one city after another to find him. How many cities? How many times? He'd call. I'd have to go and pick him up. Last time he was in a gutter. Nothing but filth and rags. I had to carry him screaming into the hospital. Nobody put a gun to your head, James. had no choice. Press a button, and you shoulder a responsibility, James. But you can't sleep nights, and your teeth are falling out. Nobody's listening. You know, Tommy... ...when the old man died... ...you know what he left me? $6,000 in medical bills. The funeral cost $1,200. I had to borrow the money from Phil. And me, old faithful... I ended up 10 years behind everybody else. For what? He was a drunk. He was a drunk. You never even went to his funeral. I had to wipe the man's ass, just like a baby. I remember, I used to rub him down with oil. I used to wash him. And I had to feed him. I fed him just before he died. And in all those years... I never felt any love from him. He would just get drunk... ...and he'd abuse me. What did you want? I wanted... What? I wanted him to respect me. I just wanted him to respect me, that's all. Jesus, James. There you go. Walking away. You've walked away from everyone who ever needed you. Don't start on me, James. You have never committed yourself to anybody or anything in your entire life. I went by the old man's store today. I had to put it up for sale. That's okay. "Do not go gentle... "...into that good night" "Rage..." "...rage..." "...against the dying of the light" Coach wants to see you, George. What did the Coach have to say? He talked about his grandfather. George is with him now. Listen, Philly, I'm sorry about tonight. Let me tell you something. He didn't look good to me. He's recuperating. No, he looks yellow or something. The operation was only five weeks ago. He looks very tired. What the hell is burning in here? Jesus, the chicken! I'll bring it to the dining room. Tommy, get in here and have some chicken. Come on. I liked my booze, my women. And after a while, I had my mother. I was all she had. "Someday," I said... "...someday I'll marry." But time does strange things. "It's high tide before you know it," as my father said. High tide. You remember Miss Mars? Sure. She was the music teacher. We knew each other for years, biblically. I used to visit her on Saturday afternoons. She'd make me honey biscuits. A very cultured woman. Protestant. Wouldn't think of becoming a Catholic. My mother was alive then. I couldn't bring her here. She'd read poetry in French. Wore silk stockings, smoked cigarettes. Elegant. And she could hump like a $100 whore. And she loved me on those Saturday afternoons. Fell dead in the street four years ago. You hang on to your marriage, George. Hold on to Marion. I'm trying. Last Friday night I drove to Binghamton. 100 miles, by myself. What's left? Hit a few bars, drink. Play old basketball games over in my head. Pick up some strange pussy now and then. Mostly now. Actually, just sit and replay the old games in my head. Can you believe that? The chicken's burnt. You know why I like married women? Why? They don't yell, tell, swell, and they're grateful as hell. Please. James is offended. No, I'm not. You better watch your Helen. Helen? No. Helen is the champion of chastity. Sex is children. She's only happy when she's pregnant. It clears up her skin. It's like old times, sitting here, talking. God, we were good. Called each other's moves every time. We were good. Sometimes I think that's the only thing I can still feel. I still feel it in my gut. I still feel that championship season. Feel the crowds. That's my best memory to date. Nothing matches that. Nothing. "Number 3..." "...at center, Martin Rhodes." I think about him all the time. He was the perfect ballplayer. Unbelievable. I've had it. This chicken sucks the big red one. You guys want any beer? Not me. Thanks, Phil. Dull night. Maybe I should go up and fall down the steps again. You want a drink, bro? No, thanks, Tommy. Christ, I have to piss. Phil is bringing these media people in from Philadelphia. They'll design a whole new campaign for you. New strategy. What do you think? I'm going for a walk, bro. Okay. You're under arrest! You scared the shit out of me. What are you doing? What does it look like? Close the door, will you? You never used to use that. You never used to drink. That shit's worse than this shit. It's fashionable. Instant youth. What else do you do for kicks? A lot of things. I got a Porsche now. James Dean, right? Upped it to 120 coming back from Binghamton. Smashed. Everything a blur. I can't see the road, but I'm laughing my ass off. Laughing so hard, I have to wipe my eyes. Now I'm hitting 135, and have only one hand on the wheel radio blaring, and this is crazy... ...but all of a sudden I think I'm just speed... ...and I know nothing can touch me. Nothing alive can touch me. And now I'm hitting 140... ...shit scared. And I'm laughing because I know that nothing on earth can catch me. Some Friday night they're gonna be putting pieces of me in a rubber bag. In here. 140 miles an hour Like a bug hitting a windshield. Listen, don't say a word about this to James or anybody, okay? Don't worry about it. Seen Phil? I've got the solution. To what? Run me. I can carry this town. You're not serious. Yes, I am serious. Run me. I can carry this town. Someone's got to challenge Sharmen's charisma. What about Uncle George? George loves this city. He'll do whatever's best. He can be convinced. Phil, I can be mayor of this town. My reputation is spotless. I am a respected public official. Remember Billy Carter, brother. Very funny. Half the time, it was your advice that turned George into the village idiot. You told him to buy the elephant. I have been keeping his head above water. He said, "Stuff the elephant and put it in a museum." Take a look at yourself. Take an honest look. Sharmen attracts people. He's young, new. He's poised. You're a junior high school principal, and you also work for the Mayor. Exactly, and I've had it with "Mr. Daley eats it..." And scrubbing "Mr. Daley's a shithead" off of every wall in the building. Philly, I have got to get out of the education business. Listen, I've found my talent late in life. I understand that. But I'm going to make my stand in the political arena. Hi, George. He wants to see you, James. Think about it. Is there any other way? My father ran the only bank in town. Elegant man. Bach was played at our house. He quoted Shakespeare: "Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of York." All gone now. Gone. Vanished. We have a city of bars, parking lots, empty mines. The coal went, and the unions killed us. But we can bring it back, Coach. Urban renewal, preserve the environment. Gone. The bank went under in '29. The Depression killed him. James, you took good care of your father. You know the courage of sacrifice. I'm going to ask you to do something for all of us. Yes? You're an alcoholic. Whatever gave you that idea? Jesus Christ. What happened? Do you need any money? I'm glad you're back. I got somebody to talk to. Is this what you want? Look, Phil has contacted these people in Philadelphia. How could you go along with this? And you. How could you go along with this? And you. You'll still be involved in the campaign, James. Sure, after the election, I'm still supporting you. After the election's gonna be too late. I'll be ruined. I told you. He'll calm down. So, you wanna dump me as George's campaign manager? I can't put $25,000 into the hands of an amateur. You'll need $25,000 for a divorce lawyer when Claire finds out about Marion. You're a shabby man. You're degenerate! Jesus, Phil! James. Get your ass in the kitchen. I said, get in the goddamn kitchen. Go on. Bastard! That's it! Come on! That's it! Take your brother upstairs and clean him up. Goddamn it. I'm not gonna take this lying down. You people do this to me, and I'm gonna tell about the kickbacks, the cops the money, everything! You're shabby! will not be abused like this! No, but you're gonna ruin us! What did you just do to me? A little while ago, he suggested I back him for Mayor. He did? Yeah, ask him. What? Go on, ask him! You want to be mayor, right? I proposed an alternative! You proposed yourself, you asshole! You're a twisted man! Get cleaned up. What are you gonna do about him? I'll take care of him. Go call your wife. And while you're at it, call Claire, you son of a bitch! Hey, James, you're a lackey! A nothing! A zero! How about the 17-year-old in Taylor? Go make your peace with Phil. How much money do you owe me? Don't you think Claire would love to know about that, buddy? And stay off the booze. James? What? Open the door. No. I want to talk to you. I don't want to listen. No more money from the dumb wop, James. Do you mind? Marion was my first girl. I thought maybe we could go back to something. But I'm only my money. Nothing else. Marion brought up the campaign money. About the third time I laid her, she brought it up, very casually. And then she talked about it for three hours. She brought up professional help. She laid it in. Well, she worked for it. I made her earn it. Cut the bullshit. She worked for it. I took her up to The Holiday one afternoon. I fucked her on the bed... floor, chair, table, tub, toilet, everywhere but the ice machine. You know the only woman I ever loved? My mother. Fuck the psychiatrists. Nobody is going to abuse me... ...or use me ever again. Nobody. I'm a new man. And I'm riding high. My youth was given over to my responsibilities... ...and now I'm going to demand my right to success. Don't worry, Philly. I'll pay you back every cent I owe you. James, you're just like my old man: desperate. He built a business 24 hours a day. Two words he knew: "Money" and "work." No, three: "the business.” Two words he knew: "Money" and "work." No, three: "the business.” The business killed him at forty-fucking-three, and we buried a man nobody ever knew. I worked for my old man, slept, ate, and I have no memory of who he was... what he was. The business is mine now. And I'm gonna keep it. I like being rich. I need money. I want two of everything: cars, boats, women, etc. Around expensive things I get a hard-on. I'm bewildered. I am totally goddamn bewildered. Never did I think I would live to see the day... ...when you people would savagely turn on each other. You're not the same people who played for me. Myths. What? Myths! What in the hell are you talking about? You call this trophy a myth? The name's there in silver. It'll last forever. That's a myth? Past tense. Bitch and whine. Blame your lives on everybody else. Did I whine when they pensioned me in my prime? A pension is a ticket to death. A goddamn passport. A boy made an obscene gesture to my face, and I hit him. Yeah, you hit him. You broke his jaw. You gotta make them respect you. Next thing I know... I'm out in the street at 8:00 in the morning with no place to go. I've watched more television than any man alive. I just talked to Marion on the phone. What did she say? She said she did it for me, for the money. You heard that, Phil. She did it for George. Next time the ice machine, right, Phil? You were right. She did it for the money. Fine, we'll leave her out of the campaign. Lock her up in the kitchen. Just a goddamn minute. I've got a little pride left, you know. Pride? You've got no pride. None. You've got a face for everybody. All slick smiles. You lost something, boy. And you, a 43-year-old whine, lost something. You, playing the lout. Screwing and ruining your life away. You lost something. And you. Stumbling and reeling through the streets, like some broken thing. To hear people laugh at you breaks my heart. You were a gifted boy. All right now, listen up. You hear me. Monday morning, we go after Sharmowitz. We go in the arena, and we draw blood. Not me. Not James. Not until my participation is settled. It's been settled, James. Not to my satisfaction. Phil, you contact those people in Philadelphia as soon as you can. You guys aren't gonna change your minds? The door's open, James. You want me to leave? The door is open, James. Either you're with us, or you're against us. All right, I'll go. Come on, James. Let's go. Come on! Low excellence. No bench. No depth. We're playing with too many injuries. You've been laughing in our faces all night. Don't start on me, Coach. You're useless. What? Useless. Stop telling us how good we were. We never had a losing season. Martin didn't say that. Who? Martin. You know why he never came back. Do I? He told us 24 years ago. Did he? You told him... ...to go out in the fourth quarter and "get that nigger center." The black kangaroo. The nigger was playing him off the court. Martin went out and broke the guy's ribs. I told him to be mean, punish some people. I didn't tell him to break anybody's ribs. He came to see you about a week after the game. He begged you... He fucking begged you... ...to publicly refuse the trophy, didn't he? He was wrong. Was he? "Never accept less than success." Right, Phil? "The price you pay is pain!" Right, George? "Get yourself a name, Tommy." I did, Coach. I fell on my ass in 10 cities. That's a record, isn't it, brother? Here's my trophy, Coach. I told him to put some fear in that guy. "Hook him. Hook him to death!" Look out, brother. They're out to get you. Win! The only sin is losing. Tommy. "Bless me, Father, for I have sinned." Tommy, come on. No. See? Read the names there in silver. Deny that. Empty. Get out! And don't come back. You know... ...I got a ticket here... ...somewhere. Don't quit on yourselves, boys. Never. You won't lose, because I won't let you lose. Seven seconds left. It's unbelievable. An unbelievable sight. It's bedlam here in Philadelphia. There are seven seconds left. Filmore High School has fought their way back from a near disastrous first half. Down by 21 points, they have unbelievably come back with Sitkowski, Romano, Rhodes, Tom and James Daley playing absolutely superb basketball. In a bruising, physical battle, they are now behind by one point 76 to 75, but they have the ball with seven seconds left on the clock. Time in. Philadelphia can't take the ball. Filmore puts the huddle around Coach Delaney. I hope you can hear me! It's crazy. Seven seconds. Coach Delaney's great basketball sermons come down to one shot, one play. Here we go! Sitkowski in to Daley. Daley, with about five seconds, gets it to Warner. Back to James Daley. Two seconds. James Daley to the foul line. One second. Yes! Unbelievable! Filmore has sweeped it. The Filmore team is lifting their coach on their shoulders. It's an unbelievable sight here in Philadelphia! Don't punish yourselves, boys. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. I'll do anything you want. You're George's campaign manager. Really? Period. We don't need Philadelphia. Right. Hell, no, we beat them in Philadelphia. I just came back for my jersey. You said we can have them, remember? You'll have to get yourself together, Tommy. I will. Feeling better? We need a speech for the VFW by Thursday. You're my speechwriter. Come on. I can't remember the alphabet. You start Monday. You put the wintergreen in George's jockstrap. That's not true. Don't deny it. I told you! Okay, boys, album time. Get the camera, James. Coach, why don't you come over to my house tomorrow? Got tapes of the 76ers and the Lakers. No, the game's changed. The good little man is extinct. They shoot down at the basket now. It's no longer my game. No longer the white man's game. Move a little closer together, all right? We'll just hide in each other's pockets. How much time we got? Smile, Coach. Get these off. Smile, Coach. Come on, smile. Say "cunnilingus."
