Who's a good boy? Good boy. - How's his agoraphobia? - It's still pretty bad. Most people would have a dog like that put down, you know? Yeah, I reckon. Alright boy. OK, come! Go on, that a boy.

Have you read this? Brilliant article on "Why men have to be unfaithful?" Rob and I are getting married. Oh my god! That's fantastic! Aren't these cute? Are you guys planning a family? No, I just like them. Aren't they just a have. These are gorgeus! We're fine together, thank you. You know... I don't wanna ruin anything. We've got each other to... ...keep warm. What? You know if... ...If the spark in your relationship, starts to, you know, go out. I guess you can tel, huh? Oh yeah. The signs are unmistakable. What's in that suitcase? Nothing. Delicious! More? There! I'm a little full, actually. - You OK? - Yea. Why? Well, I was thinking of... asking you out. Go home! Go home! Good boy! - I wish I could sing. - I wish you could play the guitar. Yeah... Airplane? Turbulence! Plane crash! - Sweetie? - Yeah? I love you. Hey. Stop stealing the quilt. I wasn't. Well somebody was. Maybe it was the Jacksons. Who? When I was a kid, if something strange happenned in the middle of the night, Mom would say: It must have been the Jacksons. The Jacksons? Who are the Jacksons? What do they look like? They're small, I think. What's so funny? You're funny. But don't you think this is weird? I don't know. But you're not even upset! It was our quilt! Well, it's not the end of the world, is it? He wasn't even really upset about our qult disappear. - Your quilt? - Yeah. - Stolen. - You think so? Yeah, there's been quite a lot of quilt theft lately. Really? So I hope you don't want a new one, because we're completely out. And of blankets. - What am I gonna do? - Sleeping bags? No, about Rob. I'm serious. The signs are unmistakable. I always take that corner too fast. Is that a car coming? - Hi, Bernie. - Good day. Tricky corner that one. Gets me all the time. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Don't I get a kiss? - I don't know. Thanks. - So, have you fixed the date yet? - 26th. Well I was thinking of roasting a whole pig. Oh very nice! And some potatoes of course. Can't blame me for the potatoes. Yeah... I just gonna get my tractor. Do you and Rob fight? No. Why? Well it could be the problem. Sometimes, you know, a bit of tension or a fight, helps to bring new life into a relationship. Baby! What did you do that for? - It was an accident. - No it wasn't. - Well, maybe I meant to. - Yeah, I think you did. Are you angry? No. - Lucinda? - What? What are you doing? I can't sell this milk, it's ruined. it needs to be sterile. Care to join me? It's 1500$ worth of milk. We can't afford to just throw money away! It doesn't grow on trees! What the hell were you thinking? Jesus bloody christ! - Oh my god. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Drosophila, it's for you! Hello. Hi. - Really? - Yeah! So you were right. Yeah, he just got all romantic, and we just... - Where are we going? - For a drive. Lucinda? Yeah? Shouting at you yesterday... It was good. - Was it? - Yea, because... It made me realise how much I love you. Well... Isn't it?.. Damn! Damn, it sounds like 78. She's got a really sore foot. Hey you girl. Hey, you'll be alright girl. I'll get you on some antibiotics. Hello! Goodness me! Aren't you cold? No. That qult, it looks a lot like one that I've lost. No it's not. In fact, it is mine. I'm sure. Where did you get it? Got it at the church fair. It's nice, isn't it? - There's lot of work been put into this. - Well it's my quilt. - No it's not. - I want it back. - Don't think so. - Yes, I think so! Give it to me! Look what you've done you stupid girl! Just go away! - What are you doing here? - What do you want? - She's got my qult! - Don't warry about it. You'll only get things worse. Just get out of here! Wait! I'm stuck! What's going on? Come on! Get going! Hurry! Why does she need all those qults? She's cold! Why do you think? What's going on here, boys? We caught her, auntie. She was spying on you. What should we do with her, auntie? Take her away and set fire to her pyjamas! But make it look like an accident. I wanna... I wanna buy my quilt back. How much will it cost? How much have you got? - Not much. - That's no good. Well there must be something... What's the most valuable thing you own? I might swap it for that. It's silly. You're silly. Why didn't you wake me? I thought you needed sleeping. The cows are gone. They've just disappeared. Well, it's not the end of the world, Is it? What have you done with them? I sold them. Oh, well, I swapped them actually... ...for the... for the quilt. See it's back. Have you gone completely insane? Where are they? Whes my... You allright, mate? I wan ma ca... What's he talking about? He want's his cows back! I wish I could help you, but you know, those cows are worth more of 400,000$. Be reasonable. He's looking a bit off colour, auntie. Would you like a cup of tea? - Play golf, mate? - No! Don't forget your quilt. Don't you want your quilt? Well, anyhow, I'll fix it in case you need it. Hi, Drosophila. What are you doing? Nothing much. Hey. How is it going with Rob? Yeah... Good. Great! I might have pushed it a bit too far. He's really upset. He's just letting off steam. Don't warry about it. Anyway, he'll be extraloving tonight. Maybe we should postpone the wedding? No, no, don't be silly. Everything's fine. - Yeah? - Yeah. Just don't think I can face the preparations. Don't warry. I'll get the Bhanas onto it, they're great with parties. Do you want a ride? I'll see you then. It's a lovely color, isn't it? - Is she nervous? - Yeah, I think so. I am... I just... just thought it'd be better if we got the Bhanas to do everything. So it's going to be an Indian wedding. Is that OK? Where is he? - Maybe he ran out of petrol. - Two days ago? How could he do this to me? I'm not that bad, am I? Damn him. - You deserve better. - Yeah. Look, I... I hate to say this, but I never really liked him. What? Yeah. He isn't right for you. Yes he is. He's so right for me. I love him. You're overreacting. Oh my God! What have I done? What have I done? Do you like it? The sari? Your sari? Yeah I am, I am! Stop! Wait, come back! Nigel. Where's Rob? Find Rob! Go! Nigel! Look, Nigel. You still in there? You can't just live in the dark, mate. It's not good for you. Wanna come back and have some dinner? You've got to eat. Look, Lucinda's worried about you mate. You got to go home. I never wanna see her again! You got to forgive her mate. - Forgive Her? - Yea. Sorry. How's your throat? Thanks. - Cooked yourself up a feed. Good on you! - I thought you cooked it... Oh, no thanks mate. I just had breakfast. Coming! Sorry? Have I heard of the Jacksons? Yeah! Everybody's heard of the jacksons. They're big! You thought they were small? They used to be big, but now they're small. Why do you wanna know? Where am I? At home, sweetie. Did you have a nightmare? Yeah... I had this dream, that you sold all my cows. Go back to sleep. It was my great-grandmother's. It has sentimental value. But that's no use to me. Rob's not very well. He needs his cows. I could see he was a bit upset the other day. I'll tell you what... I'll give up my cows, if you will give up... - What? Anything. - ...The thing you love the most. What? No. - Hmm, this is pretty too. - You can't! No! What's wrong? Do you like it? It's a nice hat. - It's nice and warm. - Is that why you're doing this? Because I ran you over? No, no, no, no. I get run over all the time. Hey! We all have to make sacrifices! Hello. Hello! Hello! Hello! Hi! Thank you! Thank you! Luce? Lucinda! Lucinda? Hey come on, Lucinda! You're a good girl aren't you?

And how did you pay for them? - I'm sick of your lies. - Well, who got them back then? The Jacksons. Who are they? What do they look like? Well, you know, they're... Oh just forget it, OK? Wait! He fainted. I think it was my driving. Oh hey! Are you leaving? No. These are my little shoes. You must have quite a collection. Yeah. Oh Lucinda. I wouldn't go down there, if I were you. He's in a really bad mood. Dr. Drakovich? Feeling better? If I knew what would make her happy, I'd do it! I'd do anything! But she can't even be honest with me! What does she want?

We built auntie a great big heater. - She doesn't need so many quilts now. - Look. What happened? What did Rob say? Drosophila? Oh that's my new 303. Isn't it she a beauty? Lovely action. It's Bernie! Oh my god Bernie, I'm so sorry! Oh it's nothing, it's just a bullet. It's just where I shot Mr. Bhana. - There's someone else. - Who? What did Rob say about the suitcase? Look, I didn't want to tell you... He got really angry and he called you a lying bitch. Lucinda. Lucinda. Who broke their promise? It was me. I did. Cheer up. - It's your wedding day. - He's marrying someone else. So? Do you love him or not? Do you love him or not? I do. Yeah I do. I do! I do! - Do you, Drosophila, take Rob... - I do! I do!

I just want things back the way they were. - It's your favorite. - I'm not hungry. Couldn't you make an effort just this once? Just shoot me if you want. Isn't this romantic? - Hey.

I don't... I don't know who you are anymore. - Oh, sweetie... - Are you OK? Yeah, I was warried about you. Is everything alright? Yah, yeah. She finally came to her senses. Oh Drosophila, you're so... ...different. I can't believe Mr. Bhana offered to look after the cows. I know. Isn't he the greatest? They're in good hands too. Cows are sacred in Indian culture. It's nice here. - No hey. Let's go eh? - No come on! Come on! The water's yucky! I'm sorry. Nigel, need your box, mate. Come on. Come on, Nigel. Ni... Nigel! Nigel! Come on, Nigel. Hey, it's not that bad. Look! Come on. Take a look around mate. It's not that bad. Boy! Hello! Good boy! Hey Nige. See? It was all in your mind. Good Boy! What the hell are you doing? I just could've hit you. Never mind about that. Look... - The nights are getting colder. - Thanks. You tell Lucinda she can keep it for as long as she wants. It doesn't matter. But maybe later on, I might want it back. OK? OK. Hey, I don't think we've ever met. I'm Rob. Mrs. Jackson. Drosophila! Hi! Sorry about that. I wasn't really concentrating. Oh, it's OK. She needed a wee bit of panel painting anyway. Didn't you have a?... Oh, yeah... - Do you want a cup of tea? - Yea. - Where's Rob? - I don't know. - Done a really nice job in here. - Thanks. Lucinda! Don't shoot! I've got our quilt. Get away from here. I was wrong. I should have believed you. It was Drosophila. She lied to me. I just... just found these today. Do you forgive me? It's too late. Can't be too late. It can never be too late. Luce? Lucinda? No. No! What are you gonna do with all those shoes? - There's quite a few of them. - Yeah. Well then... We better get started then. Nigel!
