She looks very tired. Go ahead. Let them in. Ready to make another video to send to your husband? - I think it's time... - No, no, no, no! ...to cut off one of your pretty little fingers. No. No! Hey! Come on, Sasha. Come on. Come on. Please. Be careful with that one. It's worth more than the GDP of most countries. What is this? It's a proprietary satellite designed to track some... Expensive government stuff. What? We have to stay focused. We're already behind schedule. Copy that. Morning, Sasha. Hi, guys. How are you feeling? I don't know. The past few days have been such a blur, I'm just trying to get used to freedom again. I can't even imagine. From what I heard happened here last month, I... I think you probably can. How are your accommodations? I know it's not fancy, but... It's great. I'm very comfortable. Good. Let me know if you need anything. Obviously, we're short on supplies 'cause we've been decommissioned, but we have to get essentials. Where is your dad? Still in the infirmary, but the doctors expect him to make a full recovery. It must be hard for her. She finally gets her freedom only to find out her husband is dead. It was Balzary's fault she was being held prisoner. Which only complicates it further, it doesn't help anything. Not to mention the fact that the man who saved her is also the man who killed her husband. If that's not complicated, I don't know what is. It's crazy how life changes so fast. A month ago, I had never met you. Now I can't imagine my life without you. We're supposed to be focused. No distractions. We've earned a little distraction. Don't you think? I guess so. Whoa. Check this out. Jesus, do you think these things still work? Holy shit. Let's not find out. Those stay here. I already have enough going on. I don't need an exploding truck. Hi. Hi. How is Robert doing? He's, uh, he's stabilizing. And his latest EKG is normal. Oh. That's... that's a relief. Yeah. We were worried, given how deep the bullet penetrated. It looked awful. But he's proving to be very tough, as usual. Yeah. I know a little bit about what happened in Russia. How? Our doctors, they get field reports, and we need them for any possible surgery that this facility needs to perform. I see. Okay. You know, it's in Robert's nature, and like him to confront danger almost instinctively. He saved my life. Yeah. He protects the innocent, always. I just can't help but think, what if I... No, Sasha. None of what happened was your fault. Look, you can go in and see him now. He's been asking about you. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Good to see you. How are you? I'll be fine. I heard the bullet ripped through your shoulder. Doesn't sound fine. It'll heal. I might die of boredom. Oh. They don't give you a TV or something? They packed it up. I wanted to thank you. If it wasn't for you, I would still be in Russia. They would have killed me eventually. Don't mention it. You didn't have to do it, and I'll never forget that. I gave Frederic my word. I'm sorry. For what? Killing my husband in self-defense? Ah. Ulysses, tell me you still have Paul. Ulysses? Ulysses! Shit. Ah! Ah. Ah. They say life... could be understood backwards. But it must be lived forward. That's right. Do me a favor. Try and save my wife. She's suffered enough for my sins. Please, Robert. Done. You had no choice, right? I had no choice. Well, Frederic was a complicated man. That's an understatement. You still having nightmares? Those aren't going away anytime soon, I guess. Just take one day at a time. Give yourself a chance to heal. Time heals all. Yeah. Sounds like a man speaking from experience. I can tell you and your son have done some healing together. Too many mistakes in the past. But I always did it for good. Time heals all. I guess it's good advice for both of us. Mmm, feel better. - Bye, dear. - Bye. So, there's something I haven't told you. Oh, my god. You're pregnant. What is it? My mom's coming to visit. Really? She freaked out when she heard about what happened last month and wanted me to come home, and when I told her I wasn't, she insisted on coming here. - I can't wait to meet her. - You won't have to wait long. Ken is headed to the airport right now to pick her up. She's coming today? She's gonna love Ken. It's all part of my plan. - Your plan? - Mm. I figure Ken will soften her up a little before she gets here. Ah, very smart. A little manipulative, but smart. - Hey. - Hi, I'm Carole. Oh! Wait a second, hold on a sec. I thought I was supposed to be picking up Kate's mother, but no, wait, you must be her sister. Ah, no, I am her mother. Um, but what the hell, I'll take the compliment. Ah, smart lady. This is Kate's little sister, Zoe. She's come along for the ride. You're kidding. Does Kate know she's here? No, it's a surprise. Well, that's great! Oh, my goodness. How about that? Carole, Zoe, I'm Ken. - I'm a really good friend of Kate's. - Hi, Ken. She couldn't be bothered to pick us up herself? Honestly, I couldn't wait to meet you guys' mom, so I sort of volunteered. But getting to meet her little sister, now, that's a glorified bonus. - Please, allow me to help you with your... - Oh, thank you. All right. Hold on a s... So... could you just hang on to that for me one second? - This should be fine. Well, you know. - Got it. Well. - Wow. - Had a good flight? Um, it was... it was a little bumpy. - Bumpy? Wow. - Yeah. A little. It's hot out. You're in for some good weather now. This is us here. So how did you end up working with Kate? Well, let's see. When I finally finished my deployment and came home, let's just say things got a bit rocky. Hmm. Ended up struggling back to having any sort of normal life, right? You see, I had two bad knees and a shoulder full of shrapnel. That was some real serious pain. The VA's solution was a little physical therapy and a whole lot of pain meds. Yeah, well, no, my days got pretty dark, and those antidepressants only made things a hell of a lot worse. That sucks. Oh, it did suck, Zoe. But thankfully, just as I was hitting rock bottom that's when I got a call from my old friend Robert that changed my life, thank God. Yeah, it was an offer to come work at a retreat on a beautiful island. While I was there he introduced me to Kate, and she welcomed me with open arms. That's quite a story. I know. I'm sorry. Once I get going, I can be a bit of an open book. Then you won't mind telling me what happened here last month. Yeah, well... It's certainly a very direct question, Carole. Yeah, she does that. Charms you just to set you up for the kill. The press doesn't seem to have any answers. An alarming number of people were killed here and my daughter could've been one of them. I'd like to know why. Honestly... Greed. Greed? Look, it's kind of a long story, but I guess the short version is that a very bad man tried to use our facility's resources to get his hands on a whole lot of seized government money. Did he succeed? No. And your daughter is a very big part of the reason why not. Kate is a fighter. She always has been. Oh, I know. Here you go, sir. As requested. Thank you. Just want you to know, sir, it's been an honor for all of us to help you recuperate. Thank you. Six-two-nine-nine-two. Ashcroft. Neptune. One moment please. Robert, my friend. To what do I owe the pleasure? Just missed the sound of your voice. Huh, I find that hard to believe. An unexpected call on an encrypted line? I hear you got a little banged up in Russia. Hm, well, no big deal. I'll be fine. How's our business transaction? Concluded? Yes, it has. Good. Everything okay, Robert? I think so. What is it? One of your famous hunches? Maybe. Was there anything I should know? No, Robert. We have no new security flags anywhere on the island. Thanks. Hmm. Ah, there's Dave. Here we are. Ah, one second. - Hey, Marcia! - Hey. - You're leaving us today? - I am. Ken, this is my niece, Janice. - How are you? - Good. How are you? Well, sad to see your aunt leavin' us for good. She is too. We all are. But after what happened... with all the years we came to visit, I've never heard of anything like what occured here last month. An armed assault? And any information has been virtually non-existent. Even the local police have said nothing. It just seems like there should have been a more thorough investigation. Look, I respect the concern for your aunt, but rest assured it was dealt with thoroughly, even if not reported that way, but I am sorry. Seriously. I'll miss you. You as well. Safe travel. It's kind of a shame you have to see it this way. It used to be something special, a really impressive place. Hello, hello. - There she is. Kate! Oh, baby. - Mom. It's so good to see you. - You look beautiful. - Thank you for coming. What? Surprise. How are you even more gorgeous? There is Wi-Fi here, right? Ah, not exactly, Zoe. I guess I should have given you the heads-up about that. Hey, everybody. Mom, this is the man I told you about. - Paul. - So nice to meet you, Carole. I... I heard you saved my daughter's life. I... I think I have to give you a hug. Well, to be fair, um, she saved mine first. Paul, this is my sister, Zoe. Hi, Zoe. I've heard a lot about you. - Like what? - Like that you're, uh, one tough cookie. "One tough cookie"? Isn't she adorable? Okay, stop. Not a kid, thank you. Should I take their luggage to one of the cabins? Yes, that would be great. Thank you. And do you guys wanna go straight to your room - or do you wanna look around first? - Thanks, Blain. I'd love to see the rest of the property. Assuming it's safe to do that? It's safe. Ken was nice enough to tell us a little bit about what happened here last month. It's over now. Well, I still have a lot of questions. Can they wait 'til later? I suppose so. Hey, how are you feeling? Like some asshole shot me in the shoulder. Excuse me. I think if somebody shot me in the shoulder, I'd say something much worse than that. I'm Kate's mom, Carole. Nice to meet you. You, too. - No, no, please, please. Don't get up. - She's right. Take it easy. Thank you. You've raised a very special young lady. Thank you. You, um, you wanna leave us alone for a bit and we'll get acquainted? Go see what sort of trouble Zoe's gotten herself into. Okay. Paul is a lucky man. Our children seem to be quite fond of one another. I'm sure you're worried about Kate, especially after what happened. Help! Oh, for fuck's sake, get up. - Help me! - I said get up. Yeah. I am. But meeting all of you wonderful people is beginning to put my mind at ease. Don't tell Kate I said that. So, how did you guys meet? - Well... - It's kind of a... It's very cozy. Hey, did you manage to get a signal? No, I just have some movies downloaded. Don't worry. I won't tell. You know, Blain, you, ah, you really outdid yourself with the, ah, with the spaghetti. - You're being serious. - Oh, absolutely. - Paul. - Only the third time this week. Thank you for including me, guys. Um, I had a fun night. Thank you. Of course. You're not gonna stay for dessert? Um, I'm a little tired. Well, goodnight. - Good night. - Good night, Sasha. - Have a good sleep. - Thank you. You, too. So, what's for dessert? More pasta? So, what's Sasha's connection to this place? I guess you could say she's a friend of my dad's. Is she okay? I-I don't mean to be rude, she's... She just seems almost haunted. I mean, to put it simply, she's had some very significant struggles the last couple of years, and... She's kind of just trying to rebuild her life. I guess all of us have to do that at some point. I suppose. Very true. Very true. Now I see where Kate gets her wisdom from. Oh, he's good. But seriously, it is. It is true. You know, a month ago, all I ever thought about was my company. But now... my priorities have certainly changed. Oh, pl... You know what? You guys need to get your own table with a couple of place cards. This is... So cute. Zoe helping to clear the dishes. Well, wonders never cease. I told you this place was magic. I can see why you like it. It must be a little different when people are shooting at you though. There is that. But all in all, yeah, it's a good spot. I have to admit, I have kind of been holding out. Hope you might think about coming back to Michigan for a little while. I miss you guys. I really do. You really like him. I know we just met, but... it's like nothing I've ever experienced before. How long can he stay here? Doesn't he have to get back to his company? Well, technically, we don't even know we'll have a company when the dust settles, so... And he can, technically, work from anywhere, so we figured we'll stay here for a little bit. She really misses you, Kate. She's really struggled over the last couple of years. I'm really worried about her. Why? Did something happen? Ah, you know what? This has been so nice. Let's... let's not talk about this. - Mom. - Let's make time to talk tomorrow. - Okay. - I'm tired. Maybe... maybe Ken can take us back to the cabin. Hello. Hey. I thought you were sleeping. Nah, I... couldn't. Couldn't sleep. Really? Me neither. What-What are you reading? Um... A book. - Yeah. - Yeah. It's not important. Um... Thanks for dinner. - Oh. - I really enjoyed your pasta. I mean, it wasn't, like, an Italian pasta, of course, but uh... You know, since I was really hungry, I ate it all. I'm kidding. - It was good. - I appreciate your honesty though. Any time. - What's up? - Look, uh, I was just doing some thinking. - And, um... - Yeah? Yeah, I mean... This has been home for as far back as I can remember. And I'm just... scared of, you know... what happens now with us. Where do we go? I know that f-feeling very well. My dad and I, we traveled the world together. Never actually had a home because of his work, so... - I know. - Moving on is something I'm very familiar with. Well, that was sort of the other thing I wanted to ask you. - All right. - Um, yeah. Um... Yeah, I was doing some thinking, and... wondering if you were... considering moving on again, and if you were... would you consider moving on with me? Are you serious? - Oh, yeah, I'm serious as a heart attack. - I'm just kidding. Oh, oh. - You do this... And I can't tell if you... - I'd... I'd love to. I'd love to. Yeah. - Really? - Yeah. Of course. Wow, that... that was easy. - Yeah. - Okay. You know, of all the places in the world, I don't know where to go. The world is big, I'm sure we'll find a place. How about... mmm... Paris, France? I-I would say yes. I've never been to Paris, but... - absolutely. Uh... Why? Why Paris though? - Yeah? Out of everywhere in the world, just what about Paris? Well, when... When I was 9 years old, my dad took me to Paris. Um... We were gonna go see my aunt, she was a ballerina at the Opéra de Paris. And, um, I remember passing by this amazing market, and I got this ice cream. Oh, my God, the best ice cream in the world. And, um, we never made it. Turns out my aunt was very sick, that's why we were there, and... she passed away, so... I never got to see Swan Lake - I'm sorry. - or the Opéra de Paris. And... yeah. And because I wanted to be a ballerina, by the way. - I didn't know that. - I know. I'm actually really flexible, look. Whee! Yeah, so... You're full of surprises. Well, w... would you, uh... feel good about going to Paris with me? - We would go. - You're gonna take me to Paris? Yes. - It's not a proposal, I'm just kidding. - No. - Could be though, you never kn... I... - Uh... - I... I would... - I'd love to go to Paris with you. - really... I... - Promise? Y-You have to promise. - Pinky. - Cross my heart... - Pinky swear. - ...and hope to die. But it's a guarantee. - I like that. - Yeah? - We're going to Paris? - We're going to Paris. We're going to Paris! Hey, Dad. They serve better food in Russian prisons. I wouldn't know. How you feeling today? A little better now, thank you. How's Kate's mom? Ah, seems to be growing on her. We're all going for a hike up to the waterfall. I'm sorry. I wish I could join you. It's okay. I know that look. Well, the work crews are almost done packing things up. They should be done by next week. What's on your mind? Kate and I were talking last night. Now she's thinking she wants to go back to Michigan for a while and spend some time with her family. I was thinking I'd like to go with her. You should. Really? A woman like Kate... doesn't come along often. I just don't like the idea of leaving you here all alone. I won't be alone. Ken Blain is always around. No, he's not. You and Kate are good together. Don't be a fool, son. See where it goes. Thanks, Dad. I see the look in your eyes. Reminds me of your mother and me. Don't let her go, Paul. Keep her close. I will. Hey, Ricky. Ricky? Ricky, where you at? Don't tell me you slept through a graveyard shift again. Oh, shit! How's he feeling? Bored and complaining about the food. Getting back to his old self, I see. Exactly. I told him I was thinking of coming to Michigan with you. What'd he say? He thought it was great. I like it. - Get a room. - Oh! Hoo! Oh, it's such a beautiful morning. - I am so excited to see the waterfall. - Morning. Oh, Carole. You're gonna absolutely love it. Everybody ready? Let's do this. Hot diggity dog! Yee-haw! All right, baby. You guys, you'll get used to it, don't worry. Um, I need to go to the bathroom. Oh, uh, it's through those doors, down the hall on the left. Thanks. She's cute. A little mean, but cute. Hey, Sasha. You coming on the hike with us? Guess not. I think I have enough for everyone. What's wrong? Ah, I thought I heard something. Do you hear that? Yeah, I do, actually. Kate, what's going on? - We're unarmed. - Hands in the fucking air! - We're unarmed! - Now, motherfuckers! They're up! Why don't you show me your hands, huh? - Hey! - Hey, easy! Hands off! Don't turn this into a tragedy. We've already disposed of what was left of your security team. Put it down. Sandra! Sandra, no! No! Sandra! Sandra! On your feet! Déjà vu, Robert? Here we are, together again, old friend. Reunited at the Fortress. It's a little depressing to see this place like this, though. No government security personnel. It already seems like a dying husk of its former self. I think the same about you. Are you surprised to see me? Kevlar. - Mm-mm. - You never can be too careful. - Speaking of... - Mm-hm. - Feeling good? - Mm-hm. - Yeah. You look good. - Mm-hm. You look good. You never can be too careful. I suggest you should get one of these. Where's Paul? Do not worry about him. It is time to get you out of bed. Rise and shine, Robert. Madris, would you please give our friend here a hand. All clear, boss! Sad. It's not possible. Why? Because your father shot me, left me to die like a dog? Now, you must be Ms. Taylor. Yes, I can see the resemblance. You know, there is so very much you don't know about Robert Michaels and Paul, your daughter's new squeeze. Who knows, maybe I'll be doing you a favor by nipping this relationship in the bud. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. We are together now. I'm sorry. No. No, no. Do not pity them, Sasha. It may have been Robert who freed you from that prison, but it was also he who put you in there - in the first place. - Bullshit. You said you wouldn't hurt anyone. Yes, it is unfortunate. However, she really shouldn't have run. Isn't that right, Master Sergeant Blain? What do you want, Balzary? What do I want? That's a good question, Paul. Have you heard the saying, "A man's greatest weakness is tied to his strongest want"? Alas, I have no doubt that my greatest weakness is revenge. But fortunately for me, revenge and riches are bundled together now. Ah. Ulysses, care to join us? - Didn't any of you assholes die? - It's good to see you again. I should have hit you harder. - Time to go, Kate. - Get your fucking hands off her! Enough! Ms. Taylor, everything will be fine as long as Paul and his old man cooperate. This isn't what we talked about. Nobody gets hurt. That's what you said. Shh. You're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right, you're right. Okay, the girl should not have been killed and I am sorry about that, truly. But the rest, the rest is... this is all an act. It's all part of the act. I need you to trust me on that, okay? And then you and I will get the 'happily ever after' we deserve. Take him out to pasture. But do it away from here. I don't want the wife to know. Yes, sir. Okay, here's your 15 minutes of fame. Do you believe in karma, Paul? Where did you take Kate? You see, when you end up in the same place that you started, it's time to take a hard look in the mirror and ask yourself, what is it that I'm doing? Why does the same thing keep happening to me? Where'd you take her, you son of a bitch? Where? Watch it, pretty boy. Perhaps because it's exactly what you deserve. All right, boss. We're in. Hoo-hoo-hoo! God bless technology. Now, I'm gonna simplify things this time. You see, I pride myself on learning from my mistakes. What the fuck are you talking about? I'm talking about using this system to buy shiny silver bars that just happen to be on sale. Go for it. Do your worst. Today's game is 1.1 billion in silver, for a familiar sum of 600 million in cold, hard cash. This again? Look, you know I don't have access to that money now. It's gone. I told you he would say that. Investbia is about to be dissolved by federal prosecutors and FinCEN. Your transaction violated about 15 federal laws. Everything has been seized. That money is gone. You see, we had a bet as to whether you could access the money or not. Denton here thinks... he agrees with you. I, however, do not. My account is still intact, just sitting there in an encrypted evidence file at the U.S. Treasury, awaiting international litigation. Like I said, gone. No, Paul! Not gone! Just locked. And last week, when the encryption was updated for security protocol... my hackers found it, there at the back door. Then have them get it for you. They tried. They failed. Some died. Maybe you can. How? Oh, Jesus, no. No, please. Don't do this. Please don't do this. Don't do this, please! Let's see what's possible now, Paul. Fuck this shit. So, you guys serve? Marines. That's good. See any action? Two tours in Afghanistan. How 'bout you, my friend? My friends don't point guns at me. But yeah, 15 years on the other side of the fence. Oh, you were Delta? Yep, and Green Beret after that. Impressive. Hope you don't take offense. Look, uh, at least do it up there, okay? Just let me enjoy the view one last time. Move. Keep walking. Who are these people? It's a long story. They're just after money. Kate will be okay. Hey, you. Untie her hands. She's not goin' anywhere. Oh, I bet your mother's proud of you. Shut your mouth, or I'm gonna shut it for you. Oh, he talks. I'm impressed. It appears to be the original access mark to your account, but all local credentials have been wiped, I guess, for evidentiary purposes. The only chance is to go through FinCEN administrative SSL portal. And it looks like all the administrator privileges are... still operational, for some reason. There. You're back in. What is this? It's your account. There's only 300 million there. Where's the rest of it? I guess whoever has access to it must have figured out how to somehow... - What are you up to? - I'm not up to anything. You asked me to get you into the account. You're in. Where's the rest of my money? How the fuck should I know? Like last time, you said you can't trust the government. I mean, there's maybe what, 30 Treasury employees that have access to the account, maybe someone got greedy. God. If you're lying, when I leave this island, I'm taking Kate's pretty little head with me. I'm not lying. You can walk away right now with 300 million dollars. That's a whole hell of a lot of money. Enter the authorization code before any more of my money disappears. - The code! - Okay, okay. All right. There. Now, can I please use the bathroom before I piss my pants? Madris, go with him. Thank you. You mind? What, do you wanna hold it? What the fuck is this? You never seen a zipline before? I have. You should take a ride. You run a quarter mile. I'll just wait here. No need to worry about me. On your knees. I didn't spend half my life fighting for this country to die on my knees. Kill him. All right. Fine. You win. Shit. This is for Sandra. Nice try. You son of a bitch. - Oh, Zoe! Zoe! - What happened? They took Kate to some... some cabin. Graffiti on the walls. Paul, what are you talking about? You got... you gotta tell someone. Tell who, Paul? Just go... go... go tell someone. Paul! Okay. Okay. What are you doing here? Easy, chief. Boss needs to see you down at the Fortress. What? Why? I don't ask questions. I just follow orders. Just like you taught me. You really are a disgusting piece of fucking shit, aren't you? We never should've hired you. Go ahead. Call the boss. Check it out. Call Balzary. Sleep tight, big boy. No needle. It shoots the drug so fast it breaks the skin. It's an amazing little toy. Now... I think it's time that you and I get to know each other. Oh, it's time to buy a whole lot of silver bullion. Not as much as I had hoped, but no one would call me a greedy man now, would they, Denton? Not even close. Why is Kate's video feed off? Check in with Ulysses. Ulysses. Why the hell is Balzary so mad at you all? Ulysses? What did you do? Is it drugs? Or money? Murder? You might like it rough, but I don't think you're the violent type. Okay, it's done. Transaction has been processed. A third party will hold the funds until the bullion is authenticated and certified. This all will be tracked back to this facility, correct? Should put Robert in a tight spot with the feds. Are you saying I'm driven by revenge? Not at all. Oh. Well, I am. Where are they? I'm trying to figure out. Go see what's going on. All right. And you come to Papa. Madris? Madris? Hey. What happened? Fucking clocked me with the fucking fire extinguisher. - Jesus. - He got away. You're the one who's telling the boss. Fuck you. Paul is gone. What? There is a secret passageway in the bathroom. Of course there is. Why wouldn't there be? Find him. Or I kill you. Go check on Ulysses. Oh. And where the hell is my wife? No! No! I think it's time to cut off one of your pretty little fingers. No! Stop! No! Stop! No! Now look, I promise you you're not gonna get hurt unless you put up a fight. I have no intention of hurting you. God, you got great legs. How about a dance? I ain't asking. All right, let's do this the hard way, huh? Zoe. Zoe! You okay? Yeah, but somebody shot Paul with a dart gun, and he said that they took Kate somewhere. - Where? - I don't know. Something about a cabin with graffiti. - Port Arthur, near Cascade Falls. - So, you know where it is? Yeah. It's gonna take us a while, though. We need a vehicle of some kind. Uh... Wait, what about those? What? Yeah. Yeah, that'll work. All right, I like the way you think. Stay close. Easy. Easy. In 3 seconds. Zoe, down! Shit! Time to go, come on! Fuck! - I have an idea. - What is it? - There's a rope on here. - Yeah, so what? Stop. Drop it! Going to shoot me with my own gun, malishka? Don't come any closer. Or what? Hey. Hey, hey, hey, you're okay. You had no choice. You just saved both of our lives, Zoe. Do you understand me? You're a hero. All right? Listen, I need you to keep it together, please. All right? We gotta go. All right, you're okay. Come on. I'm sorry. This is all my fault. Frederic said he just wanted to get his money. He promised me no one would get hurt. I never should have believed him. It's okay. I understand. If you can't trust your own husband, who can you trust? When I saw the video of you tied up like that, it was exactly what they did to me in Russia. No one deserves to be treated like that. Let's get out of here before he wakes up. What are you doing? Looking for keys. Keep smirking. Gonna get yourself killed. Have you seen Sasha? No, sir. She decided to stay away from you. - I'm sorry. Were you saying something about my wife? - Stop. Stop it! Why? Why, Robert? Why should I? She doesn't have anything to do with this. You really haven't figured this out yet, have you, Robert? I really just wanna make you suffer. Then point the gun at me. Too easy. Hm-hmm. Where's Paul? Oh, he slipped away like the little sewer rat he is. Hm. Good. Oh, I'll find him. Oh, I will. I got my money. Maybe not all of it, hm, but enough. I could leave right now and live a very comfortable life. But you know, I'm not ready to do that. Not 'til I kill Paul and Kate. No! Shh! But you, Robert. Oh, Robert. No, no, no, no. I won't kill you. I used to want nothing more than to take your life. But I've realized the best way to hurt you is to destroy every little thing you love. Keep an eye on them. Zoe! Zoe! Denton. I'm going to go bid our friend adieu. When I'm gone, would you please take care of that loose end for me? Good man. Hm. Farewell, Robert. I wanted you to know... I truly enjoyed the time we spent together years ago as colleagues. You, my mentor, meant the world to me. I considered you a true friend. And this is why your betrayal hurt so much. And why I must make you... suffer. Get up! Don't get too comfortable. What the fuck? What, are you gonna cut me now? - That's entirely up to you. - Ha. Where are the keys? Ah, come closer and I'll tell you. - Here's how this works. Are you watching? - Yeah. Always keep the blade at a 45-degree angle, one quick motion from the neck to the belt. But not today. Ah. You are a crazy fucking bitch. Where are the keys? You're not gonna kill me. Oh, here. Under the fucking floorboard. Don't move. Freeze! Get out of the car. What the hell are you doing here, Sasha? Come on, get these bitches! Now, tell me, what the fuck is going on here? Ulysses, come in. Ulysses, do you fucking copy? Go for Ulysses. There you are. I was beginning to worry about you. Tell me you still have Kate. I've got Kate right here in front of me. What's your ETA to extraction? - About ten minutes. - Good. Swing by the Fortress and pick me up on your way. Copy. But there's something else. Sasha's here. Why? I... I don't know, boss. Bristow got here before me, and he drugged me. Fuck! Bring her and Kate, and we'll go to the extraction point. Roger that. Hurry. You're driving. Mother and daughter... back together again. Time to head to your rendezvous point. You know Balzary. He doesn't like... Kate! Finally! - Where have you been? - Let them go. You know I can't do that. Then I have nothing to say to you. Are you okay? Have you seen Zoe? What about Paul? There. Kate's inside. You need to wait here. Stay alert. Don't move. Come on. - Place is empty. - What are those? Useful toys for later. Let's get back. All right, we're all going to the extraction point, one big happy family. - Frederic. - The matter's not up for discussion. Drop it, hero. Drop it. Now walk. Easy. Walk. Look what I got. Well, well. Good to see you. We were just about to leave. You can join us. Balzary. Check his quarters. Well, Robert. Why am I not surprised to hear your voice? Let everyone go. We can work something out. We tried that. The first time, you stole 600 million dollars from me. The second time, you shot me and left me for dead. I'm beginning to think I can't trust you, Robert. It's empty. And Denton's out cold. Where are you, Robert? You won, Balzary. Nothing is worth what you're doing. It's over. Well, maybe I will. But first your son dies. No, please, no! No, please! Please, no! Paul's blood is on your hands, Robert. Just stop this! Let them go! - What is wrong with you? - What's wrong with you? You lied to me. You said no one would get hurt. You said you'd get your money back and we would leave. These people betrayed us. These people took me in. Gave me a place to stay. Because Robert felt guilty. He's the one responsible for everything - that happened to you in Russia. - Really? Don't you get that? Robert is the one who got me out of there! And we both know the only reason I was there is because you couldn't pay your debts. - Because of Robert! - Listen to yourself, Frederic! You stole their money in the first place! He was just doing his job! Everything I've done was for us. Bullshit. This has all been about you. None of this is about us. The helicopter will be here any moment. Just the two of us, we'll get out of here. No, it won't. I called it off. You what? That's right. After I saw what you were doing, I called it off. I think it's time to stop running, Frederic. It's time to take responsibility. So now you betray me. Just like everybody else. I should have seen that coming. Betrayal. Go ahead. You've already destroyed me. Finish the job. - Hey! - Duck! Zoe, go hide with your mom. You know where. Kate... I'm going back in. I gotta finish this. Paul! Go! Drop it, big boy. Nice and slow. Oh, never disappoint. Where's my money, Robert? Where's my money, Robert? Where's my money? I made a deal with Tomlinson. The government accepted my down payment on the Fortress property. It belongs to a new private cyber-security firm. Run by yours truly. I'm gonna fucking kill you, Robert. I'm gonna fucking kill... I'm sorry. Robert, I didn't mean... I didn't mean that, Robert? I just wanna talk. I just wanna talk. Show your face so I can fucking shoot it! Fuck! I just wanna talk. Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you, Robert? Come on. Show your face. Where the fuck are you, Robert? Hey. Kevlar. Shit! Fuck! Nope. Babe. You're gonna be all right. Thank you, sweetie. I need this. You doing okay, Zo? Yeah. So glad I came. Scooch over. Look at what you went through today. That was pretty extraordinary, what you did. Thanks, Mom. Okay, no, but for real... you were amazing. And I'm really proud of you. And... Paul and I are excited about coming home for a little bit. I think the change of scenery will be good. And I think, you know, you can put him to work in the backyard or something. He doesn't really strike me as a mowing-the-lawn kind of guy. Is he a shrub-trimming kind of guy? 'Cause I... I really need one of those. I'm thinking... I'm thinking... That's so cute!
