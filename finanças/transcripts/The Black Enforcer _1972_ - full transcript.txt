SHAW BROTHER PRESENT THE BLACK ENFORCER Move, quickly, get up, move. - Go. - Go. I don't think we can reach Yuanzhou today. My home is just up the road. Why not spend the night there, and continue our journey tomorrow? We must keep a close eye on these two serious offenders. One little mistake, and we'll be doomed. It's good enough if we stay extra vigilant. Sure, we have to inconvenience you then. Fine. Why not follow the main road? It's getting dark. We won't make it to Yuanzhou. We'll be spending the night at my house. Just as well, I should pay Aunt Gong a visit. I won't see her again. Mum. Mum. Tianlong, you should have told me you were comming. - Sorry. Come. - Yes, come,come inside. - Sure. - Let's go in. We're escorting two serious offenders to Yuanzhou. We were passing by and wanted to stay the night here. We'll be leaving again early tomorrow morning. You're off again tomorrow? Look at you, you're so busy. You're hardly ever home. Now you're leaving almost the minute you arrive Big Bro, you're not allowed to go tomorrow. You must stay here for a few days at least. I can't. When I've taken the criminals to Yuanzhou, I'll come home for a longer stay. This is my younger sister. Say hello. - Hello everyone. - Hello. Xiaoqing. It's freezing cold. Prepare some wine and food for us. We rather fancy a tipple. Come, let's go inside. Xiaoqing, kill two chickens. - I'll fetch the wine. - Sure. - Aunt Gong. - Yunfei, it's you! What happened? Where should I begin? I don't know. First Senior Bro, sorry you have to spend the night here. I'll bring you some food later. Tianlong, Yunfei, what's up? He looted the Wang Mansion... and killed Councillor Wang and his whole family, 13 lives in all. I'm a law enforcer. I'm just doing my duty. I have to put brotherly feelings behind me... and bring him to court. Is it a light offence? No, he'll get life imprisonment if not the guillotine. It's cold, eat some rice. Thank you, Aunt Gong. Yunfei, why did you do such a stupid thing? It was my own fault. I hooked up with the wrong people. It's too late to feel sorry now. Big Bro asked me to bring you this food. Guan, we've come to rescue you. Bro Guan, run. - Go. - Okay. Guan Yunfei, catch this. First Senior Bro, fleeing isn't the solution. If you come with me to Yuanzhou and plead guilty, you may get a reduced sentence. Junior Bro, we had the same Kung-fu master. Let me go. I'll reward you for it one day. So what do I tell my yamen? In the end, justice finds us all. You can't escape. Come near me and I'll kill her. What are you doing? Yunfei, Yunfei, I beg of you. - Don't ruin her. - Shut up. - Burn the place down. - Yes. Dad, are you all right? Second Son, well done. Thanks a lot. Here are some silver ingots. Take them. - Thank you. - Let's go. You rooted them out. How neat. Dad, I have to go. I have to be at the yamen tomorrow morning. You and Uncle Chou should hide in the mountains for a while. - Sure, we will. Off you go. - See you. Guan Yunfei. You are great. Now, let's hurry back to Lianzhou... and divide the money we stole, then go our separate ways. Sure. Done. Guan Yunfei, this portion is yours. We say goodbye here. Take it. What is it? Don't hurry away. I'll come to see you off anyway. - Who's that? - Dad, it's Second Son. Chou Han has fallen off the cliff and died. Why are you here? I couldn't find you in the hills, and I knew you would be here. I've gone blind. I've gone blind. - Dad, let's have you treated first. - Okay... It's you, Lingzi. Don't worry. They thought you died in the fire. They won't know you are here. Relax, get well first. Here's a reward for you Master Guan, you're my boss. I can't take it. - It's yours, take it. - Thanks, Master Guan. After we have captured them, I'll make you Squad Leader. Master Guan, we must act fast. He'll probably go when he gets better. Where are you going? First to the Yamen to turn myself in. Why? They did this to you. You didn't do anything wrong. I should be punished for dereliction of duty. I will never forget what he did to my family, but I mustn't mix business with personal matters. Lingzi, thanks for saving my life. I owe you a debt of gratitude. Wait. Long, my mother died after giving birth to me. She left me these four bells. I called myself Lingzi or Bells to remember her. I have always had them on me. I'm giving you two bells now. Lingzi. Lingzi. I feel very sorry... especially... What are you doing? Get out. Don't touch her. So what if I touch her? Gong Tianlong, you resist arrest, and you attack law enforcers. Catch him. Long, Long. Let me go. Long. Go. Long. - Her too for hiding a criminal. - Yes. - Go. - No, let her go. This has nothing to do with her. She doesn't know anything. I'll come with you to the Yamen to sort things out. Gong Tianlong, you too work for the Yamen. You let wild bandits run away and you attack law enforcers. For sure, you'll go to jail if you don't lose your life first. Gong Tianlong, be good. Spend your next 15 years here. Guan, you're so cold-blooded, rubbing salt into my wound. I will remember this. Dad, you're so good at it. Yan'er, let's do it again. That's awesome. It's nothing. Many people can do it. Dad, but you can't see. My ears are my eyes. I can see. Dad, It's getting late. It's time to go home for dinner. Let's go. Yan'er, it's still early. Let's practise a bit more. Throw the dart. Wow, the skills you've mastred Who would dare to start any trouble with you? Nonsense, we must never look down on our enemies. Dad,have you got enemies? Who doesn't in this world? Gong Tianlong, your 15-year sentenced is up. Now, I'm setting you free. Ensure you stay out of trouble. Don't make any more mistakes. Mistakes? What did I do wrong? I had the wrong friends. I want revenge now. My family's dead. What do I do? Right, I'll go find Lingzi... Lingzi. Excuse me, where has Lingzi moved to? Excuse me... Lingzi. Black Enforcer, you're White Enforcer now. Others may not recognise you, but I can still tell it's you, even if you are a heap of ashes. But I don't know you. You haven't looked at me carefully enough. Not only did I cause you to spend 15 years in dark cell. I also made the girl you loved marry someone else. - Marry? - And it's into our family. So what have you left for me? A life which will be short. Yes, it is all I have now, my life. Even that you can't keep. Little Brother, do you know if the Guans live on this mountain? They do, I'm actually a Guan. Who are you looking for? I'm looking for someone called Guan Yunfei. Guan Yunfei is my father. That's wonderful, and you are... I'm his third son, Guan Hai. What do you want my dad for? I owe Guan Yunfei an immense debt of gratitude. I want to repay him today, though it's hard to repay in full. I want to kill your whole family. Who is it? Hai, what's wrong? Hai. A big bloke... What about him? He said he wanted to find Dad to seek revenge... and kill our whole family. What did he look like? He was very tall and dark, very, very dark, like the bottom of a pan. It's the Black Enforcer. Last month, Second Bro said that Gong Tianlong had left jail... an would... would be coming here to seek his revenge. It could be him. Very likely. Dad said Gong Tianlong had a dark complexion. That's why he was know as the black enforcer. He's here to seek revenge. Hai, Hai, Yan'er, Dazi. Where are you? What a day! It's all the little ones. I want to make Dad wine food. Cousin Yan'er, stop pouting. I'll go to the river and catch you two big fish. You'll freeze to death in this weather. Me? No way. Get out of the water. You'll catch cold. Yan'er, come quickly, Hai has been wounded. Come and help him. Coming. Cousin Dazi, let's go. Oh no, the wounds are bad. Big Bro, what should we do? Go and tell Dad that Third Bro saw Gong Tianlong in the hills. Gong Tianlong. Who is that? Don't ask. Go, quickly. Yan'er, where is Lingzi? Sis-in-law has gone herb-picking up the hill for Dad. Herb-picking? Why isn't she home yet? Yan'er, dress you third brother's wound. I'll go and look for your sis-in-law. Dazi, Dazi. Come, help me look for your sis-in-law. - Don't forget to tell Dad that. - No, I won't. Yan'er, here, tackle this. Terrific, your weight-free skills are getting better and better. Dad, the Black Enforcer has come to this place. Gong Tianlong? So he is here. Take a look around to see if anyone is here. No, I didn't see anybody. Dad, who is Gong Tianlong? 15 years ago, he was a most vicious house burglar. I was a law enforcer in Yuanzhou and I captured him, and I brought him to the yamen for justice. Ever since then, hatred has bred. Now Gong Tianlong is freed. He's here to seek revenge. Gong Tianlong is very smart. He actually found his way here. I heard he's a great martial artist, difficult to tackle. What should we do now? You cannot see. Don't say that. I'm not blind. I must make out I'm not blind. Do you understand? Dad, if Gong Tianlong comes to our house, don't fight him. Talk nicely and negotiate peace with him. - Peace won't come. - Why not? He thinks we Guans owe him a lot of things. He wants our lives, and also a woman. A woman? Who? Your sis-in-law, Lingzi. Who are you? So you don't even recognise me. I'm Gong Tianlong. You are Long? Long. You're the Guan family's daughter-in-law now. Sis-in-law, Lingzi, Lingzi, Sis-in-law. Lingzi. Come with me. Let me explain. - I beg of you. - Sis-in-law. - Sis-in-law. - Lingzi. Cousin Tao, stop looking. She's not a little kid. She'll find her way home. You don't understand. Lingzi, Lingzi. Cousin Tao, what is it? Gong Tianlong is here on the mountain. That's good. I want to challenge him. It was he who injured Third Bro. That's why I want to find Lingzi quickly. Didn't you say that Sis-in-law... Stop talking nonsense. Lingzi. Dazi, did you hear that? It sounds like the little bells Sis-in-law wears on her neck. - It's over there. - No, it's here. Come with me to the other side. Let's search separately... - and meet back here. - Okay. Dazi, stay vigilant. If you run into Gong Tianlong... Relax. If I see him, I'll make sure he leaves lying flat on his back. I may be the Guan family's daughter-in-law now, but I'm not one of them. My heart is still with you. Then why did you marry him? It was because I heard you had died in jail. I was going to follow you. I jumped into the river, but... But what? Fate played a cruel joke on me. Guan Tao saved my life. I... I was forced to marry him to repay this debt of gratitude. I was forced into it. All right, stop crying. I can forgive you, but I cannot forgive the Guans. Grass takes root in the ground: Like wise, rancour in the heart. The killing of my mum, the rape of my sis, the taking of my love, and the ruination of my life. He who does not seek revenge is not a man. Long, you mustn't go. - If you wan't, I'll come with you. - Come with me? To the ends of the world to make up for what you've lost. The rancour I feel in my heart, can you make up for that too? Okay. Do something for me. I'll do anything for you. Stay here for the night. Sis-in-law, Sis-in-law. Sis-in-law. These bells are Gong Tianlong's. What? Gong Tianlong also had a chain of bells. - Dazi, let's go and look again. - Stop looking. This is a trap Gong Tianlong has lain down. If you go outside, you'll be gone forever. But Dad, Lingzi is in his hands. I'm worried he may... Kill her? No, you shouldn't worry about that. Dad, how do you know Gong won't do her any harm? Big bro, do you know why? Why don't you tell me? Okay, I'll tell you. 15 years ago, Gong Tianlong and your sis-in-law were a pair. Later, he went to jail and I married your sis-in-law. Gong Tianlong came here to look for Lingzi. It's highly likely they have left together. First Son, forget it. Good men always find a wife. I'll find a new wife for you. - No - What? You're disobeying me? Dad, I will do anything you say but not this. She's my wife and she's carrying my child. You're hopeless. You were the one who sowed the seed for this hatred. 15 years ago, I asked you not to confront him, but you... What impudence! You're blaming your own father. He's running a high fever. Big Bro, what should we do? - Has he had the medicine? - He has. It should have cured his fever. Very likely, Gong Tianlong had poison on his fingers. He can be that malicious. I just won't believe that the Black Enforcer is so formidable. If he comes, I shall tackle him. If we count the days, your second bro should be here soon. With him here and our force, we should be able to overpower the Black Enforcer. I think he is here already. Why doesn't he come to find us? Why must he dodge here and there outside? He's timid. He knows my kung-fu is great. He doesn't dare take the risk of coming here. - Dazi, get my sword for me. - Sure. Let's go to the parlour to arrange matters. Maybe we can do this. If Gong Tialong comes, we let him in. First Son, you stand guard at that door, go. Dazi, you watch this door. Second Son looks after this one. Third Son and I will be in the middle. Yan'er, pretend you're Gong and enter through the door. Come. One, two, three, four, five, six. You've stopped, leaning to the right. Okay, come. Come and grabe me. Dazi, make way for him. Let him through. Your dad's eyes are not bad, eh? Show yourself if you've got guts. Why hide here and there? Don't panic. Remove his brain. Bury him. - Who is it? - Xu Muzhi, to see the owner. - What do you want? - I lost my way on the mountain. I wonder if you can put me up for the night. Will you? You lost your way? We can show you the way down. It's getting dark and I have far to go. Show some consideration. Our house is small. There's no room for a guest. I won't stay for nothing. Here's some silver for you. You've got it wrong. Someone's ill at home. Your stay will inconvenience us. I'm just the person you want. I'm a herbal healer. I can be of service to you. Please wait a moment. Big Bro, Dad. - Someone's outside... - It's okay. I heard it. First Son, see what he's like. He's quite tall and gentlemanly. He doesn't look wicked. Yan'er, go and invite him in. First Son, I'll be hiding inside. If anything goes wrong, break a bowl and I'll ome out. Okay. My cousin, my eldest brother. My name is Yan'er. My name is Xu Muzhi. How do you do? Mr Xu, sit down. Why are you here at this hour? I heard there's an epidemic up at Wang Village, and a great many people died. I'm a herbal healer. I want to go and offer them free medicine. You are their saviour. But these mountain paths are so secluded. You may be robbed. I was robbed this afternoon. What did the robbed look like? He had a dark complexion. He looked like a prison inmate. That must be Gong Tianlong. Lucky someone from the yamen came and saved me. Someone from the yamen? Could it be Second Bro? He had very nice hair. Sure, it was him. That person had beautiful hair. That's odd. He saw Second Bro, why isn't Second Bro home yet? I think he'll be here before dawn. I hope Second Bro is all right. Where is your patient? I'll go and take a look at him. - Please come round to the back. - Okay. Keep quiet. If that person asks about Dad, just tell him Dad is dead, okay? Dad is alive and well. Why must I say he is dead? Stupid, we mustn't tell him the truth. His condition is quite bad. How did he get these wounds? To tell you the truth, it was the robber's fingers. Fingers can do so much harm? Retribution will come. He who harms will be harmed. Hang in there, little brother. You must be tired. Eat some rice porridge and rest. Sure. Thank you. This place is so quiet. Big Bro and the others go herb-picking every day. There's just me and Dad left in the house. Dad? - Dad... - What is it? - He... he's away. - What a pity. - Pity? - I've heard so much about him. I have always wanted to pay him a visit. Well, this is fate. Sleep early. Thank you, thanks. There's blood on your cape. I'll clean it for you. Thank you. Sis-in-law, Sis-in-law. Lingzi. Sis-in-law. Cousin Tao, don't panic. Nothing will happen to her. Let's go home now and search again tomorrow. All right. - Cousin Yan'er, what is it? - Look, what's that? ( See you at moonrise. Long ) Gong Tianlong is still alive. So that bloke we killed wasn't Gong Tianlong. The person who's staying with us is probably him. Can't be. Gong Tianlong has a dark complexion. Mr Xu's face is so fair. We mustn't let our guard down. Where is he? Tell me. In the firewood shed. Cousin Dazi, don't kill him. He's a good person. Who cares? I'll kill him first. Mr Xu, Mr Xu, are you okay? - I was poisoned. - How? I wounded my hand coming up the moutain. When I checked your Third Bro, I accidentally touched his blood, and it flowed inside my body. So what shall we do now? What do we do? Look at you, panicking like that. When Cousin Hai was injured, you didn't panic like this. He was poisoned saving Bro. - Have you got any sense? - No matter what, he must die. Mr Xu, Mr Xu. Mr Xu, Mr Xu. Quick, slash open my wound, and press out the poison fluid. I... I'm scared. I'll die if you don't do it now. I'm too weak to do it myself. Save me... quickly... save me. Quickly... save me... quickly. Make it a bit deeper. I didn't expect you to recover so quickly. It's because of your good medical skills. It's getting late. I'll see you home. It's okay. Cousin Dazy wants to make trouble with you. Well then, I can talk to him. Let's go. It's getting late. I want to spend the night here. Do you mind? - No, you should go. - Cousin Yan'er. Dazi, don't. - Xu, I want to kill you. - Dazi, how can you treat... our honoured guest like that? - Dad. - I'm Guan Yunfei. Old Mr Guan, I'm Xu Muzhi. Mr Xu, did you see a man on your way here? One with a dark complexion and roughly my build? I think so. Then there's no mistake, Mr Xu. You cured my son. I must thank you for that. Don't mention it. It's my duty. - Mr Xu, please. - After you. Yan'er, prepare some food and wine for us. We must do our guest honour. - Please don't fuss over me. - Sit down. Mr Guan, have you lived here for long? For quite some years. There's just your family up here. Of course, it's nice and quiet, but it must be inconvenient for your friends. Poor people don't have friends. It's either friends or foes among us humans. If your friends don't come, your foes will. I heard Mr Xu was going to Wang Village. Yes. It's still quite a distance away past the mountain. You may need some money for your journey. Take this as a gift from me. Now that you have money, you can go on your way. No rush, there's still something I want to do. I'll go when I've done that. Dad, Lingzi is home. Lingzi, where were you? We were so worried. Sis-in-law, Tao and I looked all over. Where were you? I went herb-picking for dad, and I lost my way in the woods. - Why didn't you... - Enough. She's home, so there's no need for any more questions. Sis-in-law, Sis-in-law, we are so relieved that you are home. Yan'er, your sis-in-law must be hungry. Make her some food. Okay, I'll dig up some turnips. Lingzi, we have have a guest. Here, let me introduce you. This is Mr Xu. This is my wife. First Son, remember the words written in blood on the skylight. I know. I'll take extra care. Uncle, do you think Gong will come here tonight? Gong Tianlong is a smart fellow. He knows I'm good at kung fu. He will back off because of that. I think it's better to be careful. The saying goes, he who comes will come with ill intentions. I feel tired from the chat. I'm going. Dazi, go down the hill with me. I want to check why your cousin isn't home yet. Uncle, you stay here. I'll go. Were you with Gong Tianlong last night? No. Lingzi, please don't leave me. I won't. I'm carrying your child. Even when the baby is born, you mustn't go. I'm yours. Where can I go? Lingzi, ensure I don't see what may be there twixt you and him. I'm very worried I may lose you. I can't lose you. - Who is it? - Uncle, it's me. - So, any news? - None. I'll go myself to the first village to ask, and also to find out about your second brother. Why isn't old Guan home yet? He said he'd be out until dark. It's dark now. Maybe he's trying to avoid Gong. What a joke! Dad is fearless. He has no fear of Gong. Dad, you're home. The food is cold. I'll heat it up for you. No need. I've eaten outside. Sure enough, Mr Guan is home. I told you so, he'd be back. Any news about Second Bro? Cousin Dazi, did you see Second Bro? Dazi, what time is it? The moon will soon be right above our heads. How come I don't sense anything happening? If Second Bro were here, we would have nothing to fear. We're waiting for Master Guan. By the look of it, Master Guan can really fight. Everyone knows how good his knife skills are. If he aims at your nose, it won't be your ear. I think Gong is a chicken. He fled hearing that my cousin would be home soon. Dear Brothers, Gong Tianlong won't flee. - He will come, for sure. - How do you know? See if the moon is right above us now. First Senior Bro, this place is so hard to find. A-Ling, who is that? Is that Gong Tianlong? She's your daughter-in-law now. She has long forgotten Gong Tianlong. Dad, is that Gong Tianlong? You dad may be blind, but his mind is still very clear. I may use another name but he is not deceived. Your face is supposed to be very dark. How come it's so fair? I spent 15 years groping about in dark cell, without seeing any daylight. How can I not be fair? And you sound different too. For 15 years, I talked to n one. Of course my voice changed too. You... you've come for Lingzi? Yes, I've come for Lingzi, and also, your dad. Since he has given me so much, I must give him back a little, to square things off. 15 years ago, Gong was a law enforcer at the Xingzhou yamen. He arrested two wild bandits, Chou Han and Guan Yunfei, but your second brother came and helped them escape. He killed my mother and my young sister. My younger sister was about your age at that time. - This old beast actually... - Stop. My children are here. You dare to slander me. Dad, is he telling the truth? I may be blind but I'm not senile. You will die before my eyes. Time for kung-fu. Uncle, listen, Is that my cousin? Master Guan? He's gone forever. I saw him on my way here. What did you do to him? Master Guan had excellent knife skills. Look at this beautiful hair. Don't cry. We Guans don't cry. We're indomitable. We may bleed but we don't cry. Dazi, quickly take revenge for your cousin. Wait. Debts have their own debtors. I want Guan Yunfei's life, not yours. You were not in this. Gong Tianlong, come now. I cannot see. The darkness makes it fair. Excellent, I waited until now to make a move. I did that for fairness' sake. We will die without regrets. Dazi. First Son. Fear not, attack him. When did you learn to fight in the dark? How come the darkness doesn't affect you at all? You forgot I was locked away in a dark cell for 15 years. I may have had eyes but I didn't see any light. It was as if I was blind. I am used to groping about in the dark. The house is too small for us to fight. Let's go outside. Don't, I beg of you. Leave me alone. I know you are a real man. It's not worth risking your life for Dad. I beg of you, don't go. Dad, stand back, I'll take care of him. Guan Yunfei, I bear no grudge against your son. If you use secret darts again, I'll kill him. Dad, Dad. - Uncle, I'll go and rescue Tao. - No, you won't be able to. - Dad, what should we do? - I'll think of something. Dazi, make an overnight journey to the yamen and ask them... to send law enforcers here to catch him. Sure. Let's go inside. Gong Tianlong, come out. Gong Tianlong, once I'm free, I'll fight you. Come out. That's wishful thinking, you fool. You're no match for me. I'm waiting for your dad. Once your dad is here, I will let you go. Dad... Dad... Dad, Big Bro is calling you. It's very cold in here. Yan'er, light a fire. Dad, why don't you go and talk to him? Thrash it out, the two of you. You're afraid to see him? Could he have been telling the truth last night? Dad, you're really afraid of him? But you know, Big Bro... is suffering because of you. Big Bro is suffering right now in the snow. Why does he... Shut up. Yan'er... - Yan'er. - So you are a sugar-coated... bogus beast. Yan'er, you're wrong. I was wrong. I misjudged you. I thought you were good. I treated you so well, and you do this to my family. You have no idea what your dad did to me back then. Your dad caused all this. It was he who pushed me to this. It's better to end, rather than encourage enmity. You've killed my brother. Isn't that enough already? Must you let this rancour go on? Please forgive my dad. He made a mistake, it caused you immense suffering. But he didn't have it easy either. He's all grey now and he's blind. How many more years does he still have left to live? Yes, my dad killed your mother and raped your sister, but it's been so many years now. We should put it behind us. I can't forgive him for my mum's death. Today, it's him or me. My dad wronged you but I saved your life. Remember? Let him go. Yan'er, I... If you let him go, I'll be good to you for the rest of my life. Dad, go, quickly. It's either you or me today. Right, today, it's either you who will live or me. Dad don't. Dad... Dad...
