If I didn't love you, you wouldn't have the helmet. Now do it again. You want to be a winner or do you want to be a loser, Rich? Huh? Winner or loser? Rich is gonna be a winner. Now let's go. Royals down by one. Seven seconds left. This is where legends are made and dreams are crushed. The fans couldn't have asked for a more exciting start to the WBL Finals. Rich Johnson, he promised to bring a championship to Sacramento after a 40-year drought and a win here would put them one step closer! Stivers is wide open! God, Jerry, what a hog! He is not gonna pass the ball. Rich is going one on one. Strictly isoball and throwing up trash in here for the win. Wow! Unbelievable. If you don't like that, you don't like Royals basketball.

Do you think she's single? Yeah I think she's single because all of her options are either dead or can't get it up anymore. What the hell is wrong with you? Hey, people have done a lot worse things to become famous, alright? Hey baby, if you were on Tinder I'd slide right... into your panties. Nice. Diapers? She's out of your league Q-tip. You lost. Um, what if we tried that from a different angle? We did. I don't know what to tell you Mr. Johnson. How about the bottom line? Ok well, the bottom line is, I'm the fifth doctor you've seen and we all share the same diagnosis. Your days of playing on that knee are coming to an end.

Wuuuh, wuhhhh, winning! Winning! That is the single most important thing that we're going to do when we go out there is win! Win! It's all about winning. Ok? Everything. The most important thing in the world. Not friends, not family, not the environment, not this plastic problem that we're having. It has nothing to do with that. It is about winning.

Any asshole could yell at a little girl, but it takes a funny one to say that kind of stuff. I know it's you, Earl. You can't see shit. Why don't you bend over and call the game with your good eye! That's his butt hole That's it, get out of here! You want a piece of me? Get out of here, Earl! Out? It's about time. You know what, here! Hey, look at me! I'm playing soccer. Stupid ass sport!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh my God, I hope that's ketchup. Mommy! It's "Weinergate" folks. Rich Johnson decimates a little girl with one monster rejection. What a bloody wanker, Rich Johnson put that banger in a sticky wicket! We have to talk about this weinergate situation. Rich Johnson just tore up that poor weiner! Rich, you just took it way too far, man. Rich Johnson from Basketball is involved in weinergate! What is wrong with him! Hurting a little girl is offensive and wrong! And the biggest surprise in all of this? Johnson was actually for the first time ever, playing some defense. What is going on with Basketball!? He must go... The World Basketball League's Vice President Bill Smegman has declared a meeting to determine his fate, and it doesn't look good. Yeah, yeah. You wanna go, huh? Shouldn't you be handing out some flyers? Well, I would but I'm incapacitated right now. Yeah, no thanks to you, you dick head! Beat it, weenie breath. You're weenie breath. Nice, nice. Really nice. Get him, boys! Oh, ok, great. Ok, come on. Ooh, yeah. Oh, come on. Guys, really. What are you guys gonna do? You gonna cheer me to death? Hey, easy. Just chill out, ok guys? Just chill. Take a chill pill. Stop, chicken! Oh, you're late. What a surprise. Yeah, uh sorry about that, Shmegs. I was outside signing autographs but it's good to see you, Shmegs. No, it's Smegman, Bill Smegman, ok? I know, Mr. Smegman. I'm sorry. I was just joking. You're joking? Yeah well I'm not. You know, you're really lucky we kept you out of jail for a felony. Do you have any idea what they do to rich basketball players in jail? Well, I'm sure it gives a whole new meaning to the term "taking it to the hole". Ah, yeah. But not so good for somebody who plays defense as poorly as you do, pretty boy. Ouch. Yeah, but you know what? Look, I got a plan for you. I don't think you understand but your grief to dollar ratio is higher than it's ever been in your entire career. Well that's good, right? I mean, you're still making money. What do you care? What are you, an idiot? I don't think you understand the grief to dollar ratio concept. Huh? You don't get it, do you? You know what? Let's roll the tape! Oh, come on! Get up you commie or I'm gonna make you red, white, black and blue. Come on! What is this bullshit? Get up. Come on. This is god damned ridiculous! You know, after all these years, you're costing us more money than you're making for us. Yeah, but you need me. I'm Rich Johnson, super star basketball player. You're Rich Johnson, super star ball buster! You my young friend are a PR nightmare. It's a full time job managing your bullshit. All this crap has gone viral. Now we're forced to fix it. You know, someone once said, "a man is only as faithful as his options." Was that Abe Lincoln? No, it was Chris Rock. And if you want to be faithful to this team, you have one option if you want to stay in the league. Look at this asshole! This is all your fault. Schmuck. It's official, starting tomorrow, not only is Rich Johnson suspended for the next 5 games of the championship series, but also during the suspension he will have to lead a charity basketball team, named the Sacramento Stars, to raise money for various organizations. We are told if he screws up, he will be out of the league for good... But if he completes his service, he will be eligible to play in Game 7, if the series even goes that far. I've got you, kid. Daddy, I wish you didn't have to go. Yeah, you me and the rest of the world. Sweetie, can we have a minute, your dad and me? Hey, practice that three! You're going to be able to keep your promise, right? CostumeCon? She has a tiny heart and she can't afford to be broken by her hero. You. Of course. Yeah, ok, I said I would be there. Hey, let me see that 3, come on. Hey son, why don't you take your WBL MVP trophy and show these clowns what a real professional basketball player looks like? It was a piece of shit anyway. You're not using your ass enough, Luther. Come on, Mikey! Use it! Alright, sweetie. I love you. Talk soon. I love you. I love you too. You got this. Dad. Yeah. Looks like it's gonna be a lot of fun, son. Don't share any glasses or needles with these guys. More like a carnival really. Hey, dude. I left my luggage out there, but be careful, I've got a laptop. There ain't no bellhop here and no man either. I'm so sorry, ma'am. Yeah, it's the haircut. It fools a lot of people. Uh, yeah. It could be the hair. It could also be the bass drum that seems to lodged in your throat. Are you saying I have a man's voice? Um, you know what I probably just need to clean my ears. What up Hollywood superstar in the house! How the hell did you end up with these freaks? Man, it's a crazy story. I think about 10 years ago... Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Well I guess that answers that. Ok. Let me get off you, here. Excuse me. Hey, bad idea. That's Mobile's seat. Yeah, well now it's my seat now. For a few seconds. Hint, they don't call him Mobile because he's from Mobile Alabama... even though he is from there. You're in my seat, Dick. Oh. Um, I don't see your name anywhere. Thought you'd say that. Now you see how he got his name. He moves people, literally. Tell him, Mathews. Literally! You better ask somebody. Well, thanks Mobile. I wanted to use the restroom anyway. That's for saying I sound like a man. He look like Avatar's shit. Oh, Luther, John Luther. Yeah, I'm surprised you remember. Oh, come on man. What happened to you? We were supposed to be in the pros together. Oh wow. Excuse me, man. Not all of us got drafted Mr. 1st rounder. I went to Europe. That's the only That's the only ticket I got so I took it. I made a nice life for myself over there. Not, I mean, like your life, but I was able to take care of my family. Alright well, at least you have some pro experience, not like the rest of these losers. What are you doing here? To keep living the dream, man. The dream? This is more like a nightmare. Wow. Nightmare, nightmare. You know what? You might surprise yourself by doing something you actually like for someone else other than yourself. Ok. Alright. Thanks, Tony Robbins. Yo! Superstar needs a nickname. With a name like Johnson, who needs one? Oh, ok. I get it. Johnson. Good one, Mobile. Oh, this is gonna suck. Another day, another dump. I hope this place has indoor plumbing. Yo, Mike. You'll get some serious double mattress action up in this piece. Don't tell nobody that shit! What the hell does that mean? Better pray you never find out. Well let's just hope that this place has a spa. No, but we gave you the luxury suite with a Jacuzzi. They gave it to us for free because tomorrow they're demolishing the hotel to build up some condos. A day too late. You know Rich, feel free to trash the hotel room. You know, get out all of your frustrations before the first game, alright? I mean just tear shit up, alright? Yeah, just go crazy. You want rock star? I'll show you rock star. I'm Rich Johnson. I'm Rich Johnson, ten time WBL all star, all time WBL leading scorer. Huh, Smegman! You hear that, Smegman? Do you hear that? Oh, you don't hear me? You wanna feel me, huh? I'm a rock star. You feel that, Smegman? All time leading scorer. WBL! What in the hell do you think you're doing? What's the problem? I thought this place was being raised. You're building condos, right? Looks like you're building a bloody nest. Hey, he fell for the old demolition gag! This week is gonna be the best week we've ever had within a week. Hey, this ain't the WBL superstar! Welcome to the stars, baby. Juvenile. Just juvenile. Hey, it's me. How's the knee? Good. Considering now I look like Papa Smurf. I got thrown in the air like a rag doll and don't let me forget the 10,000 dollars in damages I've got to pay for this hotel room. Well look at the bright side. At least your dad's not on the tour with you and you've got CostumeCon coming up with you daughter. And at least we get to play some basketball tomorrow, finally. Who are you playing? Some team called the ABS. They're supposedly the greatest athletes in the world but they're like a bunch of crybabies. Mmm. Sounds fun. Well, I love you. Alright. You too. Alright, Rich. Let's keep in mind that this is for charity, man. Alright so we've got to let them score some points and we've got to let them win. We can't them walking around here crying. That's the weirdest pep talk I've ever heard. Are you kidding me? Gentlemen, you are the best of the best of the best. Are you kidding me? This is- This is insane. I thought we were playing a real basketball game. I thought we were playing the ABS. You know, athletes with six packs. This looks like a friggin' playground. Uh, no. We are playing against the ABS, but it's the Adult Baby Society. Don't you watch Jerry Springer, man? Oh! Sorry, sorry babies. My bad. I think you might want to use this. Yo, who's your daddy?

Does he have it? Oh my God. Seriously? Is he sleeping? Oh Canada has lost the game and Nick has lost his career. and the worst part is... Ok. Alright well, sweet dreams little buddy. What is this? I thought it'd be a good idea to loosen up with a little yoga before today's game. Welcome gentlemen and Namaste. Nah, I'm a leaving. Yoga's for bitches, dude. It's a common misconception. Yoga is for males as well. It comes from a place of strength. It actually helped me get through my recent divorce. Now I want you to all say it with me and totally buy in. Namaste. Namaste. Beautiful. Beautiful. Bring it back to center. There we go and we're gonna reach our arms out for our first stretch. A modified warrior. Really stretch out. Yeah, feel it in your delts.

Breathe in, breathe out. Time for the Fatalis pose. Reach those arms out this time with your palms facing up. And we're going to ever so gently bend those biceps, bringing your palms up to your face like you're wondering, How did I ever get to this moment? How did I end up here" Oh, he is fucked up. Where'd you find this guy? Downtown at the fitness center. He works at the downtown fitness center? No, no, no, no. He lives behind the fitness center in the alley. And we're back to center. We're back to center, beautiful. Now we're going to end this session as I've ended every night since my wife left, by leaning forward. Just slightly leaning forward. We're going to grab onto those glutes for support. Loosen up our neck. That will be very important and just bring your head all the way down and try and suck your own dick.

Jerry O'Connell, show the face. I want to tell you that your professionalism just got in the way of what could've been a great moment. When I flashed my natural born, black breasts in your face, you didn't even break character or the reaction that I was banking on that I would get today and I'm not sure I want to work with you anymore. Do you know how many motherfuckers want me to shake my natural born, titties in they goddamn face? You need to slide into my DM's and see who the fuck I am. But that's ok. It's called acting. You could've act surprised. Cut, fuck. I'm tired of talking. Wow, that's real shit right there.
