Please leave him to rest now While I'm away I trust you with my wife and daughter and everything I own I don't know how to thank you for donating your blood to dad I did what anyone would do -Behave yourself Nagla Why?! Did I do something wrong? Ramzi is still a stranger No, his blood runs in my father's veins now! That makes him a relative right or wrong? Right! He doesn't look like a waiter, he is from a good family right? Whatever his family he is just a waiter When I first saw him I was so happy, you know why? No I don't! He looks like our biology teacher He always give me good grades and the girls are jealous! They gossip about us, do you know what they say? What? They say he is in love with me. I'm happy for you! He is so cute, except just one thing What?! -He is so shy When I look at him he lowers his eyes, can you imagine that! I will tell you a funny story that happened Tell me later let's go to sleep Everyday I will eat my three meals at your restaurant, good night Good night Miss. Nagla Good night Won't you let me tell you the story of my shy biology teacher? Once on a sea cruise the girls kept rocking the boat, can you imagine? And the boat lost balance, we kept crying and screaming The principal told the teacher to save her first, You know what he did? No darling I don't He ignored her, and pulled me out the water first, do you see? Actually it wasn't deep but I pretended to be scared I held him tight as he carried me Do you like this? Isn't it a nice story? Good night Good night My dad made this swing for me, although he never buys anything for himself For 100 years he wore the same suit, but he'd buy me anything I asked. Your father is a good man with a kind heart Is your dad still alive? Yes but for me he doesn't exist How come? My father is a good man, like yours he gave me all I wished for But one day and for the first time he forbade me from something I loved And from that day on we don't see each other Was your father wrong? No, he was right, he wanted to keep me away from bad company But I liked my friends so much I left home because of them But you won't leave us, dad loves you a lot And we all love you too, do you see? What's wrong? Something in my eye Open your eye, more, more... You have beautiful eyes... Your eyes are more beautiful You didn't answer me, you won't leave us right? Yes or no? Spit it out! Nagla! Nagla! Ramzi promised he will stay with us Get changed so we can visit your father at the hospital Ramzi will take us right? You will go alone, we have a lot of work here, I need him here to help Its my fault, the brakes were faulty and I didn't fix them. There's no chance someone tried to kill you? No way, all those around me I love and they love me And the new guy who works for you? Ramzi is my best friend and I trust him completely He also donated his own blood to save Dad's life Do you see? I was right about him Sorry if I bothered you. Get well Thank you and goodbye -Bye Tell me my kitten, what's going on at home? Everything is like clockwork Ramzi's taking care of everything? He does everything right, we are so lucky to have him He is serious, hard working and honest You you can see the honesty in his eyes And you are paying attention to his eyes too? Yes, because I got something out of his eye As long as Salma is happy with his work. She is so hard on him, tell her to be nice, Dad For my sake, OK? -Sure baby Just to make you happy, my kitten How sweet. You want me to take care of Ramzi? Do you want me to hold him? Not that much Should I also rub his back? -Don't exaggerate! Just go easy on him He has been good to us. I just want him to know his limits Your daughter is too friendly with him I don't want people to talk Don't say this, Nagla is just a kid Not any more. If you'd seen how she's acted since she's arrived you'd do something. Ramzi, I want to tell you a secret -Tell me Last night I dreamed of you Sounds like a nightmare. -It was a sweet dream I'm embarrassed to tell you Why? Tell me everything I dreamt we were married and sleeping together on a beautiful bed You know why? -Why? It was our wedding night Oh God, that's nice. And what we were doing? Wonderful things, we were between heaven and earth The bed flew like the magic carpet while we are holding hands That's all?! No, there's more You read me poetry and I sang your poems We stayed like this till dawn It was a beautiful night You are wonderful! -Really, why? Because you see nothing in life but the bright side It was a beautiful but it can't come true until I graduate in two years. Dad is back! Dad is back! Dad , I missed you so much! Its not the same without you! Thanks darling -So much I want to tell you! Welcome back, are you feeling well? -I'm fine thanks, son I missed you, my children On the 7th day when you were away, we woke up 6.30 in the morning Ramzi choppied wood and I was getting vegetables, At 7 o'clock, Ramzi prepared the tables and made tea At 7.20 Salam went to the bathroom, 8.30 Salma got out of the bathroom At that time Ramzi was serving 21 customers. The total income came to 137 Lira.... That's enough Nagla, your father is tired, go to sleep Good night Good night, my child I missed you so much, my lovely -No, the doctor said no! What do he know? Give me a kiss Leave me alone! You've not recovered yet! There will be time for this later now go to sleep But I want you now Ramzi, it's Nagla These are my favorite poems Sweet dreams Ramzi! Open Ramzi, It's me Salma Good morning, Uncle Saleem I'm going to the post office Do you want to send a love letter to your sweet heart? I will send it for you. You don't hear me but you understand everything, you fox! Good morning madam So, you closed the door on me Did you forget that your husband is back and we can't be like before? No, we have to find a way, I can't go on like that I'm in love with one man and married to another And what can you do? He is your husband Now you say he is my husband?! Why didn't you remind me before? Since the accident I've changed I regret being unfaithful to the man who treated me like a son You are becoming soft, did the doctor transfer Mazhar's blood to you instead?! I must confess everything to him to clear my conscience He won't believe you! He would throw you out like a dog! Then it's over for me here, I will leave on my own You can't take a step away from here without me! Did you forget that the police are still looking for the thief, my darling? You are under my thumb I can make or break you, depending on my mood. Enough, this servant can't take no more! The servant is leaving! What a creep! What's up? I heard yelling Ask the madam, if she wants to tell you .. Salma, why did you hurt his feelings? Forgive me son, don't leave! Salma likes you a lot believe me, she has a temper but... She actually likes people Are you heading to Istanbul? -Yes get in Ramzi, where are you going? I'm leaving, Nagla You lied to me Didn't you promise never to leave? Was I a fool to believe you? I thought you were honest I told myself I'd finally found the Knight of my dreams Are you coming or not? You thought you'd scare me? I knew you'd come back So, what brought you back? Fear or love? Believe me it was not fear Then it's love Ramzi, I'm so happy, darling We will always be together Waiter! A bottle of wine here, please OK Bottle of wine coming up. Fine A fine bottle of red wine After the accident you should pay more attention to your health Work less and drink less I intend to retire, the youth should take over now What do you think, my son? Why not get another bottle to celebrate? Another bottle for the doctor Should we build another floor upstairs? Why waste the money? The house is too big for us I want the kids at home in their own apartment Is Nagla getting married? I want to see her children And who she will marry? -Ramzi of course Of course you've noticed I want to retire, you will be my only job, Darling Are you crazy? How can you marry off your daughter to your servant? Don't say that, Ramzi is like a son to me Did he asked you to marry her? -He don't have to ask I have eyes! When he left she just fluttered her eyelashes and he ran back home You are so stupid, Mazhar! You give your daughter to some vagrant who you know nothing about! Ramzi is a good and honest man This will never be! If you don't care for your daughter's future I'm like her mother and I will not let this happen Can't you see what you're doing? Don't fall for him, you are so naive and innocent See what you did to me? My heart is beating fast Calm down darling, Nagla is still too young, when she is old enough we will see And after you jumped to the water and the thieves got you, what did you do? We crashed into a police check point and I ran away Great, and then? The police chased us, I took the case and came here So, where are the jewels, I want to see them. I lost them they took it from me Great! This is a nice story I'm telling you the truth! -And I don't believe you I think you made this up to stop me loving you But you don't know how to lie, you're an honest man Nagla, why you don't want to believe me? I'm a thief and a conman And James Bond too, but I still like you. Good night thief! I came to tell you a riddle I once knew a handsome guy His fortune was under his feet but he looked up in the sky He fell and broke his neck. Do you know who I mean? What do you mean? -I discovered your latest con You want to marry Nagla to inherit everything and kick me out! Nagla is so far away from my thoughts. Stop playing games! Want me to tell Mazhar you're a conman? Shut up! Don't even think about it! Nagla?! What do you see in her? Is she better than me Ramzi? Tell me? Why don't you say it? Cover up and get out!! You will never get Nagla as long as I live You will come back to me on your hands and knees You were born a hustler and that's what you will always be! We're from the same breed We are made for one another You love nothing but yourself and money! You don't know what I do for your love If you are afraid to get rid of Mazhar I will do it alone, if that's what it takes. Get dressed! Get out and don't come back! When I have the money you will follow me like a dog Salma! Salma! Rub my back darling Salma, I can't see I can't see Can you take me to the police? -OK get in Wake up It's still too early I will go down and no one will rub your back! OK, I'm up already, good morning my darling Fill the tub, I will make tea and come back Why are you going to the police? I want to report a crime And who is the criminal? -I am Wow What else do you want? We want you, you think you can fool us? When they opened the case in London it was empty You can't screw us! Salma Here I am darling Your soft fingers make me young again my darling Anything you want Salma, what are you doing, stop fooling around Salma! Saleem, Saleem, Saleem! The jeweler was smart He knew the gang was following him . He carried an empty case on the boat And he sent the jeweleries with his secretary by plane. I'm very happy it ended this way I had hard times and bad luck all of my life You're still young You can start again Start again? By the time I'm out I'll have lost the most important thing in my life A great love that purified my heart and awoke up my consciousness True love will live forever How long it will be for me? Under these circumstances maybe 2 years or less OK, I'm on my way, no one touches anything Come with me I wish it was me, I'm old and had enough of this life But she was so young And beautiful , She had a pure heart Until the last minute of her life she was comforting me. My condolences Be brave Ramzi, see what happened? She is gone, forgive her if she was tough on you But she had a pure heart and she liked you a lot, believe me Ramzi May God forgive her Why son? We love you and need you with us now Dad wanted to build an apartment upstairs for the two of us, see? I want to stay but I have a contract for two years and I have to fulfill it And then you will come back, right? If you still want me then I would have paid my dues And you will be out of school Did you discover anything officer? What can he discover, it's god's well It's just fate. Yes, it's fate.
