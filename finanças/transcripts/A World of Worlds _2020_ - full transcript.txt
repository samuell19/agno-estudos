- So what you're telling me Syfal, is that you haven't seen or heard anything out of the ordinary lately? - (heavy breathing) Cayla please, I'm telling you the truth. I have not seen anything. - And you are certain you haven't seen anybody who may of looked odd uh? - No, no I haven't seen anything out of the ordinary. Cayla please! I don't want to die! - Sil has seen this man in his visions, so I know he's somewhere near. And you were given a simple task of keeping your eye open and nose to the ground. - I'm telling you the truth. (footsteps crunching) I haven't heard anything. - And I understand information can be elusive at times, I get that. But what I don't get is why you would do business with the resistance, those underground shits who think that they can overthrow Sil, your new Lord! - Wait Cayla, please! (heavy breathing) (Cayla laughs) - You think we wouldn't find out? - (groaning) Please! Cayla please, I was trying to get information for you. - Shut up you lying shit! (Syfal screams) - I never liked you Syfal. I would of slit your throat a long time ago but Sil found your influence useful. All you were to do was to keep an eye on things and report back and in return your family stays safe. But what do you do? Go and mingle with a bunch of has been soldiers who think that they can overthrow a God! Are you mad? (thudding) - Commander, he claims to have seen two people running from the forest. - So child, tell me what you saw. - I was chasing down a weasel for food when I saw two people run from the forest. - Did they run past you? - No, I was about 100 feet behind a tree when I noticed them. - You said they ran out of a forest, which forest? - The Forest of SiKoran. (heavy drum beat) - Are you sure it was SiKoran? - Yes - What did they look like? - They were too far for me to see, but one had on a black jacket with a hood and he was pulling someone else behind him. - Pulling? - Yes! They were running pretty fast. - Why were they being chased? - I don't know, I didn't see anyone behind them. (forboding music) - You shit! All this time you knew! (sword whooshing) - No, no. (splattering) (footsteps crunching) - (sighs) Get up! (sword scraping) Is that all you saw? - Yes Ms. Korvesian. - If you're lying to me about any of this boy, I'll gut you and feed you to my dogs. Do you understand? - Ye, Yes Ms. Korvesian. - Good, what's your name? - Orin. - Orin, you will take over Syfal's role. Find information on any nearby resistance groups and what roles Syfal played in them. You have two weeks to report back to me. Is that clear? - Yes, yes thank you Ms. Kovesian. I won't let you down. - Of course, your life depends on it. Go, begin! (footsteps crunching) - LyGon-Ril-Cylus-CorRegin! (clashing) (electric zapping) (grunting) - Ah. Hmm. (dramatic chord) (blade whooshing) (squelching) - Ah! (thuds) - All of you, listen up! I am Cayla Korvesian, commander of Sil's army. And you are now under the rule of the new republic, Sil's republic! Your days of freedom are over! We decide what you can and cannot have! We decide what you can and cannot do! Your fate lies with us! Do you understand? - [All] Yes. - I can see in your eyes you want me dead. Well I want you dead too but my king has plans. If any of you decide to run off, I will personally hunt you down and hang your body parts from the trees. Do you understand? - [All] Yes. We own you! (footsteps) (upbeat music) (door clicking) - What? Monica, damn, can somebody have a moment of peace? - What are you doing in a bar this early in the morning during working hours? - For your information, the owner let me in here and technically it's not open. Anyways, how the hell did you find me? - That's what I do! Anyway, where is your little friend Eric? - I don't know, you're his boss shouldn't you know? and all I got was his corny little voicemails. - Well there you go, maybe he got lucky and overslept. He did catch a nice one last night. - Pff! - What, you jealous? - Ah no, it's just disgusting how you guys see us as catches. - Yes we see them as catches. I didn't say anything about you. - Oh shut up! If you hear from him, tell him to see me pronto, if he doesn't want to get written up. Oh and also, Mills has some more reports he needs him to do. - More work? He's already swamped with the work you gave him yesterday. - Yeah well not much I can do. Mills is trying to save his ass by getting these reports ready for his presentation next month. - At Eric's expense? Unbelievable! - Like I said, not much I can do. - Whatever, if you're done, can I get back to work please? You're killing my vibe girl. - Vibe? You're not even suppose to be listening to music on the job anyway, let alone in a bar during working hours. - Shoo, go so I can get my work done. - Shoo? You don't shoo me. You think you can just wave your hand and I'll go running away 'cause you wanna listen to music and act like you're doing work? In a bar? (laughs) Who do you think you are? Prince? - Monica, you know I still have that photo of you back in your experimental college days. - Oh, don't you dare Jimmy, you better give me that photo. - Then you let me get back to work and you leave Eric alone. - Fine, whatever! But I'm still watching you. - Ew! - F-U Jimmy! - Ooh, whoever she is Eric, I hope she's worth it. (upbeat music) (footsteps tapping) (door clicking) (electric zapping) - Must you keep throwing me around? - What is, what is this, what is this? - Good, the king's coming through. (footsteps tapping) - What were those things that attacked me in the forest, huh? Sofia, is that even your real name? What is going on? (footsteps tapping) - Things that attacked you in the forest are called The Children, mastered by an evil sorceress named Sidra. Eric, I'll explain more later. I just need you to be quiet and be still. (bottle clinking) Here, have a drink! (footsteps tapping) - Sofia I... Oh, I'm sorry I didn't realize you were changing. - Eric please, haven't seen a woman before? - Well yeah of course, I didn't want you to think-- - Alright, alright, stay where you are if it makes you feel better. (fabric crinkling) (zipper zips) (footsteps tapping) - Wow, um. - Let me properly introduce myself. My name is Sofia Hayden, army commander of The City of Merc, your city Sire, and my duty is to help you get your memory back. - My memory back, my memory is just fine. I clearly remember you slapping me on stage. - That I did, but I'm here to help you remember your true self. - What? - Please, sit down. Let me explain. - Uh, uh, oh on the floor? - Yes Eric, on the floor. - How do you feel? - Well, I mean, I mean, how, how am I supposed to feel? Okay, I am trapped in a theater with you and all I want to do is go home. - Do you feel any comfort at all? - No! - Are you feeling stronger? - No Sofia I don't! - Okay, let me explain. You are on a planet named Ressear, our Mother and you are not really Eric Wilson. You are the reincarnation of a King named Zhayian Crehin. Lord of Merc, master of the Nebtonian art form. You ruled over the Eastern sector 2000 years ago. - Wait, wait, hold on. So your saying that this is not Earth but a planet called Rosser. - It's pronounced Ressear. - Okay, alright, yes, so if that's true, how did I get here? Do you own a spaceship or something? - No, I bridged you over. - Bridged me over, you mean like beam me up Scotty? - Something like that, just more organic. - Okay, yeah. - Don't mock me Eric, this is not a joke! A great soldier and good friend gave his life creating this bridge to find you! - I'm sorry, I am sorry. - His name was Akinnis, remember that! He was the only one that believed in prophecy. He believed in you. - Alright alright. - We have a new threat. (fire flickering) A gifted warlock named Yahzeel who's taking over most of Ressear. (screeching) Combine forces and take over both Ressear and your planet, Earth. - Why does he need Yahzeel? - Because he can't do it himself. (whooshing) Only Yahzeel (background screeching) has the power and intellect to do so. - And so you think that I can help with this? - Of course, you're Lord Crehin. But you can't do it yourself. You need to find the other three and assemble the Royal Four. - The Royal Four? - Yes, that is how the citizens began to call you after you defeated Yahzeel. - Look Sofia, look, lo, I am no hero king, okay, and this world that you live in doesn't even sound like a place that I wanna be a part of, okay? I am just Eric Wilson an analyst, alright? And thanks to you, I-- - Okay. I'll take you back, but let me do this one first, okay? - This is the Stone of Essence. After you guys defeated Yahzeel, you had the four of you insert a part of your essence into this stone. - Why? - To help find you in your new bodies, in case a great evil threatens our Mother again. And only someone strong and pure of heart would be able to command it. - So I'm guessing you're the strong and pure of heart. - So far. - To be sure that you're Lord Crehin, I need to see if your blood flows with our Mothers energy. - Wha, wait, hold on, so you plan on cutting me open or something? - No, I just need you to stay seated and if this doesn't work, I promise, I will take you back myself, okay? (clicks tongue) (sighs) - Alright, fine, let's get this over with. - Keep your palms closed. (Sofia softly chants) (ominous music) (loud whooshing) (grinding) Ooh! (groaning) stop please, please stop, stop! (heavy breathing) (gentle music) - No, no. But the stone glowed. Maybe I was in the right area but I had the wrong guy. So why? (heavy breathing) All I have to do is take him back (digital zapping) and look for a more robust man. Yeah. (electric zapping) - Gom BY Ronen Boa! (loud bang) (heavy thud) - Ah! (heavy breathing) - Go Ron Bi Corr Vel Oa! (loud bang) Where's my wife? Where is my son? Speak maggot! - I brought you back Speak! - Our Mother is in great danger. We need you to help assemble the Royal Four! - What do you know of us? - I know you are heroes. You saved our Mother from Yahzeel and you created the Stone of Essence to find you. - Only the strong and pure of heart can find the Stone of Essence and wheel its power. Is this you? - Yes sire. - Then show me my stone. - Here is the Stone of Essence. (dramatic music) - (exhales sharply) It's been a long time my friend. I can still feel us all in here. Let's find our comrades. - Sire? - Who are you and what is your title? - I'm Sofia Hayden, army commander of your kingdom Merc. - Army commander? - Yes sire. - What day and age is this? - 21st century sire. - Interesting. If you are who you say you are, show me your soldiers mark. - Army commander, good to meet you. Now who's this creature that threatens our Mother? - His name is Sil. He's taken over many lands and plans on finding and resurrect Yahzeel. - (loud crunching) Yahzeel! What does he know about Yahzeel? - I believe he wants to use him to take over-- - Yahzeel cannot be used. He cannot be reasoned with. That's why we buried his corpse so far down. There nobody-- (loud bang) (voices whispering) Ooh! Who are these people in my head? (loud whooshing) Get out of my head! (screaming) (whooshing) (loud banging) Ah! By Loe Bor, Ah! (loud whooshing) - Sofia! (groaning) What are you doing? (loud bang) - Gah! (loud whooshing) - Sire, sire, sire? Sire, sire. Hm. Welcome home sire. (birds tweeting) (footsteps crunching) (heavy breathing) (foreboding music) - They're close. (low growling) (tense music) (growling) (suspenseful music) (creature growling) (dramatic music) - You were one of us? Oh my god. What has Sil done to you? To us? If I had known brother... Rest, and may Mother find you a peaceful vessel. (dramatic music) (hisses) (dramatic music) (growling) (bones cracking) - [Soldier] Lord, are you alright? (dramatic music) - Commander, it's Lord Sil. - Yes, my love. - Where are you? - I just leaving Syfal. - Good. Meet me at the northern end of SiKoran by the bridge. - SiKoran, why in-- - Cayla, just be there! - What is it? - He wants us to meet him in SiKoran. - SiKoran, why? - I don't know, but if he insists, it must be important. (phone ringing) - Ahh, Vowlan, I haven't heard from you in quite some time. You better have good news for me. - [Vowlan] Yes, my lord, we have got Yahzeel. - Are you sure it's Yahzeel? - [Vowlan] It is him. - Are you positive? - [Vowlan] Yes, I am very positive. - Good work Vowlan, very good. Make sure to secure the area. - [Vowlan] But there was a problem. SiKoran has woken. - What? - [Vowlan] He's killing everyone. - I'll take care of it. You just make sure nothing comes near that site. You understand! - [Vowlan] Yes, I do. (dramatic music) - Where did you learn to fight like that, boy? - Fight like what? I was just trying to defend myself. - Don't lie to me. Where did you learn to fight like that? Who trained you? What is your species? - I, I'm just a villager, I swear. That goon was trying to kill me, okay. I just did what came natural. - Exactly! Common villagers don't fight like that, unless they're some type of spy. Are you this, a spy, villager? Are you some sort of resistance groupie hoping to bring back the good old days? (laughs) Maybe I should open you up and spill your hope all over the ground. - Please, Miss, I'm not a spy for the-- - It's Lieutenant Kryst to you, boy. - I'm sorry Lieutenant. But I'm not a spy for the resistance. I'm a spy for the New Republic. - Really? How so? - Commander Korvesian tasked with a mission. I'm supposed to locate any nearby resistance groups and report back to her. - Commander Cayla Korvesian task you with a mission? - Yes. I'm supposed to infiltrate their ranks and find out what my town leader knew and report back to her. - What sector are you from? - The western sector. - That's Syfal's area. How you plan to do this without him knowing? - He's dead. Cayla killed him. - That would make it easier. Does the Commander know about your fighting skill? - No, I don't have one. Look, I've seen your soldiers fight before. I just tried a few moves and got lucky. - Moves like that are not built with luck. You'll come with us and I'll find out who you really are. - Please, Lieutenant, please I have to complete this mission, otherwise my village is gonna be slaughtered. - That is not my concern. Guard. (dramatic music) (phone keys beeping) - [Quilinresh] This is Supreme World Alliance. - Hello Quilinresh, I'm needing to schedule an emergency meeting with the committee tonight. - [Quilinresh] Ooh, it's kind of last minute. I don't know if I can-- - I'm sure you can gather them. - [Quilinresh] Well, you know tomorrow is the event-- - Yes, yes, I know Kyten is- - Good, so they don't really want any disturbance during this time. - Cut me off again, Quilinresh, and I will send Cayla to visit your family tonight instead. - [Quilinresh] What about 9:00 p.m.? - Yes, 9:00 p.m. will be perfect. - [Quilinresh] Good. - We'll be dining in the Red Chamber. - [Quilinresh] Then I'll go and contact them. - Good, see you there. - Lieutenant, please listen to me. If I was to come with you, and Commander Korvesian finds out that you interfered with a mission directly instructed by her, how is that gonna look on you? You really want to take that chance? She's known as The Daughter of Demons. Do you really wanna gamble with her? - Guard, call headquarters. Confirm the story. - Lieutenant, they do not know anything about this. - Of course they wouldn't. I just came from her an hour ago. - Call the Commander! - Directly? We're normally not allowed to-- - Shut up and just do it! (phone ringing) - No one's answering. - It's your call, Lieutenant. - I know it's my call! Just shut up and let me think! Fuck! Okay, spy! Go ahead and complete your task. But if I find out you're lying to me... - Thank you, Lieutenant. - Don't thank me. You just better be right for your sake. Keep a tag on him. As soon as he reaches the resistance, send me his coordinates. It's time for things to change around here. (dramatic music) - [Guard] Lord Sil. [Both] My love. - My beautiful demons, tell me, what have you learned? - Not much, out of this forest by someone in a black cloak. - Who saw him? - A young boy from Syfal's village named Orin. - Was Syfal aware of this? - [Cayla] He was, but he lied about it. - [Sil] Where is he now? - Still in the barn with a severed head. - Good. Anything on the Resistance? - No, but I gave that young Orin a task to find out what he can and report back to me in two weeks. - [Sil] Are you so sure you can trust this kid? - If he wants a family to come back to. Besides, no one knows Syfal's dead beyond that barn. The Resistance will just look at him as some loner. - And from what we gathered, the king's protector may have taken him to the northern sector of the city. - Well, you may not need to concern yourself with his location any longer. I've just had a very clear vision of him running down a road alone. - Can you see which road he's on? - No, which is why I brought you here. As you know, we stand in the mighty Forest of SiKoran grown from the ashes of the legendary monk Reynu SiKoran himself, thousand of years ago. His roots run deep within Mother, linking us all in millions of ways. I can use his essence to find their exact location. - My love, entering into an immortal's essence pool is suicide. It's too dangerous. It's pull is too strong. It could drain you till you're dead. - Il-Roserious is right. You very powerful my love, but SiKoran is one of the Five Immortal Wonders of Ressear. No one has ever survived after tampering with their essence pool. - None of them were me. It is time for SiKoran and all life on Ressear to know that I am a God! (creature growling) Stay down you wicked creature! I am your Lord now! (creature growling) (speaking in foreign language) You listen to me now Reynu! (creature screeching) (growling) Down creature! - My Lord you... What you did was... The power running through your body would have killed the strongest of art forms. How do you feel? - I feel marvelous! SiKorn's essence is everything I imagined. And now he belongs to me. He's under my control. - Do you need anything? - Yes. I need for you to bring me the king's head in a bag and place it on my table. I wanna be able to look him in the eyes While I enjoy my meal. - Did you happen to see where he is? (dramatic music) - The king is headed for the Ti Forest on the west end. He'll be there within the hour. - You should join us my love. It will be fun. - You go enjoy yourselves. I have much to do. But hurry, we're having company tonight. A new era has begun. (tense music) (dramatic music) You thought you can hide Yahzeel from me, didn't you SiKoran? Do you need help, miss? You answer to me now. (growling) Once I revive Yahzeel and learn the art forms of the Royal 4, I will be a god among gods. (dramatic music) Ressear, (Fire swoosh) Earth, and all living things will bow before me. (dramatic music) - Hello? Are you okay? My name, my name is Eric. Do you need help, Ms. Um... - Well, hello. (dramatic music) (Eric grunting) - Who are you people? Are you with Sophia? - Sophia? I don't know any Sophia, but I know you. My Lord says you are one of the legendary Royal 4. - Look, I don't know what you're talking about, okay? I am no king. - How did you know we were talking about kings? - Does it matter? Okay? I am not part of no Royal 4. - Yes you are, yes you are. Sil says you are the reincarnation, one of the kings. So which one are you? - (grunts) Look, this is just a big misunderstanding, okay? I was held-- (shushing) (Cayla sniffs) - You do smell different. - (grunts) Ah, bitch. - No, my name is Cayla. (ominous music) You are special. I've never tasted blood from an ancient before. You could say you're my first. (metal scraping) (Eric grunting) You haven't realized yet, but before you do, Sil wants your head back in a bag. Of course, I'd prefer to keep you as my pet, but such is life. (whizzing) (dramatic music) - Sire, stay behind me. - Did you just hit me with a rock? That wasn't very nice. So what do we call you? - My name is Sofia Hayden, army commander of Merc. - The City of Merc? I thought we buried all you cockroaches. - [Sofia] As long as I still breath, Merc lives, Cayla Korvesian. - Oh, so you know me? - Of course, a sadistic bitch with daddy issues. - Well, I killed daddy, so he's not an issue anymore. Look, let's get this over with, shall we? Hand over your king and I'll let you live. - So let's get it over with. Talingol byne kon-yet. (fire roaring) (whooshing) So what they say is true about the Korvesians. Your bloodline is resistant to chants. - Well, this isn't fair. You know quite a bit about me, but I've never heard of you, Sofia Hayden. - Commander Hayden to you! (pistol firing) (metal clanging) - Girl, if you wanna piece of me, you're gonna have to do it the old fashion way. - Then, so be it. (suspenseful music) (swords clanging) (tense music) (thuds) (Cayla grunts) (swords clanging) (thuds) (Sofia grunts) (inhales sharply) (swords faintly clanging) - The king is over there. I'm gonna go get the king, you help Cayla. (tense music) (thuds) (Sofia sighs) - Come on soldier, you're not gonna let a little tap on the jaw stop all this fun. (swords clanging) (suspenseful music) - Come on, girl. Don't let a little push on the jaw stop all this fun. (swords clanging) (thuds) (Sophia grunting) - Sofia, watch out! - By day or by night, I raise my sword to the light, I raise my sword to fight. To protect the kingdom of Merc, as mother as my might. (Tenan yells) (thuds) (whooshing) (scraping) (thuds) (gurgling) (whooshing) - Commander, you're all clear! Kick her ass! You alright? - Yeah, yeah. - Behind you, behind you! (tense music) - Ah, the famous Tenan Fy. (Tenan grunts) (thuds) (tense music) - I see you're still on the wrong side of things-- - Don't! She's dead. I'm now IL-Roserious, Quinsentian leader, better known as the Painted Guard. And I am gonna make certain that you fall! - How did it come to this? - My eyes are open, Tenan. Wake up! The Nebtonian life is over! This world belongs to Sil now. Accept it or die, Tenan. - Okay, fine. You choose to die by the hand of an old friend, then come on! (dramatic music) (blades whooshing) (swords clanging) (blades whooshing) (thuds) (grunts) (thuds) - Your skin can't hold up against my blades forever, Tenan! (grunts) (blades whooshing) (thuds) (suspenseful music) (thuds) (whooshing) (blades whooshing) (Painted Guard yelling) - Fuck! (Painted Guard grunts) (Tenan grunts) (thuds) (Tenan yells) (blades whooshing) (thuds) (blades whooshing) (thuds) - Tam-ki-yian! (whooshing) (booming explosion) (ominous music) (Painted Guard yells) (grunting) (panting) (grunting) (whooshing) (thuds) (metallic rattling) - Look, I don't know how you are, but you seem to be the reason for all this. Stay down and don't move. - [Eric] Okay, okay. - And if I catch you trying to leave, I'll kill you. - [Eric] Understood. - Okay? - Yeah. (tense music) (thuds) - Threesome, huh? Okay. (Cayla yells) (Tenan grunts) You're a Croarthian! No matter, I'll find your weak spot and I'll gut you all over this forest! (low zapping) - Great shot, Chip! - Hey, guys! There's a guy, he's hurt. So, you're alright? - Yeah, yeah I think so. - What's your name? - Eric, Eric. - So your gonna thank me, Eric? - Yeah, yeah, thank you for picking me up. - No, for saving your life. - Saving my life? - Yeah, she was waking up. She was gonna kill ya. - Yeah, yeah, thanks. - You're welcome. - We must kill her. She's too dangerous to survive. - I know. Now go help your king. I'll be there in a minute. - [Tenan Voiceover] King? What king is she talking about? - When I kill you, I want you to know it's me. Until then, Cayla. - [Tenan] Sophia! (tense music) (footsteps quickly rustling) (rustling) (inhales sharply) - Get off me! Take two of your men and head that way. There are four of them. Bring me back the odd one. - Yes, Commander. You and you, come with me. - Commander, Lord Sil requests you come home immediately. He's scheduled a meeting with the committee. - Fine. Bring me my car. (ominous music) (whooshing) (birds calling) (heavy footsteps) (chants words) (mysterious booming) - Come on, come on! (chants words) - [Man] Akinnis! Akinnis! - [Goon] Are you trying to build a bridge to Earth? That's a myth, soldier! Those rebels filled your head with talk of a sister planet. Akinnis, do what's right, and vow your allegiance to Sil. - I am getting really tired of seeing your ugly face, Goon! (battle music) (roaring) (chants words) - [Goon] Akinnis, you really think this will stop you? (whooshing) (battle music) Argh! - Fucking Goon. (grunting) - [Goon] Akinnis! Give up already! Your band of rebels are all but dead! Your race is dead. Sil is the true law of this planet! Can't you see that? - Sil's days are numbered, the royal four will return to put him down. - [Goon] You were once a revered soldier of Merc, a legend of your race, but look at you now. Running around, looking for ghosts with a band of misfits. What would your dead family think? (laughs) - Shut up and just die! (action music) (snapping) (whooshing) - [Creature] Shit, the children. - Go ahead, kill me! The kings will be found! And Sil will be done. (action music) (funky music) - Eric. Eric. Eric! - Yeah, I noticed that. Hey, you wanna hit that new bar around the corner after work? - Naw, I may just stay home tonight and meditate. - Meditate? Look, Raquel's a bitch bro, she played all of us. - Yeah maybe. - Yeah, you need to let her go. You need to meet me down to the bar so we can find another Raquel. - Huh, what? - Yeah, I'm just saying. Damn! he is going to need a report on each of these by the 16th. - The 16th, that only leaves me 5 days, Monica, I don't know if-- - Well you need to. If you have a problem with it take it up with Mills. And you know what, that means you will be fired. So pick your poison. - Yeah, yeah, I'll get on it, it's fine. - Jimmy, would you mind? - You know Monika, your horns are showing. - Eff you Jimmy! - That's one crazy bitch. Hey, five thirty, me, you, women, new bar? - Man, you heard that demon. I gotta get this done by next week and I need all the time that I can get. - Look, you need to relax and get laid before you explode. I'm gonna help you this weekend and get this project done, okay? - Come on Jimmy, seriously. Hey let me ask you something. Have you ever felt you were meant for something larger in life, you know, like something better than where we are now? - What, Eric what are you talking about? - You know, like you were meant for something more meaningful that can change the world? - Eric are you smoking your socks? - I'm serious Jimmy, I feel like something big is coming my way real soon. - I hope so, boobs, in your face. - I'm serious bro, I don't know what it is, but something is coming. - All I know is, you need to get laid. You need to meet me tonight, at the bar, with the bitches. [Mysterious Voices] Help us, hurry. Help us, hurry. - Jimmy, stop screwing around. - [Mysterious Voices] Come back, help us. - Jimmy, you know what, if you're out there. - [Mysterious Voices] Remember. - Jimmy? Anybody? I think I'll have those drinks now. - Let's do a toast, hey, my man Eric! - [Crowd] Eric! (cheering) - Hey Jimmy, hey everyone, thank you, thank you. - Glad to see you're gonna live a little bit, huh? - Yeah yeah, I just needed to take a break, that's all. - Look, Mills and watchdog, don't worry about them, man, we'll get you a job somewhere else. - Yeah, true, I just don't want to start over somewhere else with some new assholes and new ass rules. - There's gonna be assholes you're gonna deal with in life, all the time, E. Your job is not let them get you in your heart. - Yeah, thanks Jimmy, you made sense for once. - Oh, you're trying to be Mr Funny Man now, huh? - Hey Jim, buy me a drink Jimmy. - What's in it for me? - Think of something. - Slick, let me get another two. (footsteps) - Ahem. - Oh hi. - I'm Sofia. - Sofia, er, hi, I'm Eric, Eric Wilson. - Go Eric! - Oh, I'm sorry, were you sitting here? - I just saw you with your friend. He look like he'd rather buy drinks than hang with hims friend. - Well you have to get to know Jimmy to understand that he's a good guy. Oh, I'm sorry, would you like to sit down? - [Sofia] Thank you. - Is everything all right, did I spill something on my face, or did I spill something on myself? - No, no you look good. - Oh. - You just look familiar, that's all. - So, erm, do you come here often? Oh no no no, that was so bad, I'm sorry, just, I'm. - Relax. (laughs) - And that's why got punished for two weeks. - So I guess you played it safe and became an analyst. - Yeah, I guess you could say that. It pays the bills, but um, can I ask you something? No no, nevermind, forget it. - Too late, what is it? - Well, sometimes I feel that I'm destined for bigger things, like something important is going to happen and I can be free of this everyday hum drum. I don't know, it' just crazy talk, but. - Not at all, I believe that everyone was someone else at one time or another in another life, if you believe in that sort of things. - Actually, I do, I feel like I'm built in a different day and age, you know like at a different time, and I have the ability to make a positive impact in people's lives. - Well, let's talk about going somewhere different. - Sure, yeah, where would you like to go? - I know this great lounge across town that makes great wings. - Wings and a lounge, sign me up. - I'll get the cab. - And I'll be back. You got this Eric, you got this. Can't screw this up, all right. You're a man, you're a man. We can do this. - I got it, crazy! - [Eric] So what's this place called again? - [Sofia] I forget, but I already told the driver where to go. (groaning) (birds calling) - Where am I? Where is everybody? Jimmy? Sofia? (screeching) What is that? (yelling) (leaves rustling) (sinister music) (screeching) Get away from me! Get off me! - [Figure] Come on, get up, they'll be back soon, move! (action music) - Is it one of therm? - Yes. - Is it a king, or the queen? - King, perhaps. - Can you tell if he has realized yet? - I don't believe he has realized who he is, yet. This cloak over his location I haven't felt before. - Sire, who is this king you are concerned with? - Cayla, do you remember when your father had you put away? For you own good, he said. Said your ways were, how did he put it, unconventional. - [Cayla] Yes. - But you didn't believe that. Slaughtering your entire family was mighty cold. Overkill, perhaps. But you were simply nourishing your true nature. The real Cayla was born that night. - Yes, a glorious evening it was. - This king wants to destroy everything we've built and stand in the way of our progress. - Yes, sire, but, haven't we killed all of the opposing kings? - Not this one. This is one returned. One of those who imprisoned Yahzeel two thousand years ago. I just can't be sure which one it is. - The legend? Of the queen and three kings. I thought that was a myth. - This is no myth, he is one of them. And you need to make him go away. Go and make him a myth for me, and bring me back his head. - It would be a pleasure, sire, I can't wait to taste the blood of an ancient. How would I identify him? - He will stand out. He'll be the one they all protect. Go, be quick, he'll be a bigger problem if he realizes. - Sil, the children, I feel they're in some sort of pain. That's impossible. with ancient magic, well the ancient magic can affect them. So either his protector is well- versed, or the ancient essence running through his veins is enough to protect him. - Maybe not, maybe it was the level of intensity and energy that we unleashed in our last takeover. It could have made a rip between worlds. - No, I would have felt it. I didn't feel it open this time. We gotta field this king. This is not good. - Sil, our time is here and now. We need to find and resurrect Yahzeel immediately, and end this fear of kings and queens. You are the only king. You are the only real king Ressear needs. Everything is yours. One Cayla Find and kills that creature, he will be a myth once more. Let's continue with the plan and become the god you are meant to be. - You are something, aren't you? Prepare the plane for home, we have much to do. (snarls) - [Figure] Come, on come on, move. (panting) Come on, come on. - Wait, wait, wait. (grunts) (chants words) (groaning) (chants words) Look, look, look, I have money int he bank, I can give you it, I promise, if you let me go I won't say anything to anyone, I don't even know-- - [Figure] Be quiet! Does anything look familiar to you? - No, no, it doesn't. - Hello, Eric. - Sofia? Whoa re you? Why, why are you dressed liked that? What the fuck is going on? - You are the beginning piece of saving our planet. - Saving our planet? Look, I don't know what kind of drugs you're on, but I know a facility that can help you with that-- - Shut up, and listen to me! You need to remember who you really are. Remember when you told me about a feeling you had of being part of something larger? Something important, something worth fighting for? Well that day is today. Welcome back, sire. - Sire? What?
