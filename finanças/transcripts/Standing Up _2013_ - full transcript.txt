I read about this monkey that the Russian government sent to outer space. They figured out that after a few weeks, he would die because the heat from the sun would become unbearable. They said his journey would prove to be invaluable to the advancement of the space program. I wondered how they chose that monkey... Nice! That specific one. And why, if he was so special, would they put him in a situation where he could die. If that monkey knew what they were choosing him for, would he have behaved differently? Did he cry when he realized what they had done to him? Ready? Lift. Quiet. Move. Sometimes popular kids can be really cruel. They can bully you into thinking that there is nothing special about you. They tried to do that to me at Camp Tall Pine. I thank God for sending me someone who changed my life. Guys, come on! Come on! Go grab some firewood. We need you to keep the fire going. All right. I'll go find some wood. Good. It's time now. Wait! Wait! Come on, get off! Bryce, get off! Guys! Guys, come on! Help! Bryce, get off! Come on! I don't know about this, Bryce. Hey! Do I have to do everything by myself? Come on! Get off of me! Get off me! No! Stop! Get off me! No! Get off of me! Guys! Please stop! Bryce, no! No! Stop! Please! Come on! No! Stop! Please! No! Look, he is cold. Come on, man. Don't you get it? That was awesome. I don't think he gets it. Let's go. Have fun! You think he is okay? Who cares? Go away! Hey! Hey! They left me... I said go away. I can't! They left me out here with nothing. Please let me in. The mosquitoes are killing me and I'm freezing. They ditched you too? Did they ditch you too? Yes. Did they leave anything? Nothing but a backpack with some junk in it. No blankets or clothes? I'm freezing. There is only one blanket. I have it. So I guess we are this year's joke. They'll be back in the morning to laugh at us, I'm sure. I hate them. I really hate them. There is a candle and some matches. I'm gonna light it. Don't look at me. I mean it! I thought this was supposed to be a cookout. I'm so stupid. How'd they get you? They told me we were going to desert Julia Christiansen. We were all supposed to go skinny dipping, and we were going to ditch her. Ditch Julia Christiansen? Isn't she kind of popular? I thought they liked me. What if we weren't here when they came back for us? What if we swam to shore? We could sneak back into camp and get some clothes, and then just show up for breakfast tomorrow and act like nothing ever happened. I don't ever want to see them again. I don't want to talk about this anymore. Just kind of shut up, okay? I'm gonna get some wood to build a fire. We need to stay warm. They're coming back. What? They're coming back! No! Oh, no, why? They're probably gonna take our picture and make us eat sand and stuff. You sure? We can go down to the water, and when they come sneaking up, we'll grab their canoes. Are you gonna come with me? I don't know. I'm going. Wait! I'll go. Should we put out the candle? No. If they see the light, they'll think that we're in here. There is still some kids down there. What do we do now? Sara? We swim. Come on. But I can't swim. You tell me this now? All you have to do is hang on. Can you do that? Yes. I can do that. All right. Stay low. This will hold us. Come on out. I told you, I can't swim. You won't have to. I'll push you on this. Come on! Come on! It's too cold. I'm gonna fall. No, you're not. Just hang on! They're not here. They wouldn't try to swim for it, would they? She can't swim. She is scared of the water. What about him? He can swim, but that's about a mile. I don't understand how anyone could think this would be remotely funny. That poor girl told me she wanted to go home, and I convinced her to stay, that she'd make friends eventually. She'll recover. That's just what kids do. It's a tradition. Well, tradition sucks. I feel sick. There is a cottage up the hill. Can you walk? I think so. Come on. Where are we? In the cabin. We broke in. How far away from camp? I'm not sure. The current took us a bit off course. You put the blanket over me? On the beach, the blanket. If you ever tell anyone about this, I'll kill you! I found us something new to wear. Here. Here. Eat these. Might make you feel better. The sink doesn't work. I've gotta get some water out of the lake. I think we should move somewhere else. Move where? I don't know. Somewhere. Somewhere? I want to find a phone. I need to call my mom. Okay, we'll find a phone. You should really call your parents. They're somewhere in Greece right now. What are they doing in Greece? They're archaeologists. They're working there. They didn't take you with them? No. They wanted me to make friends my own age this summer. Yeah. My mom said the same thing. Maybe if I make my mom come get me, she can take you and drop you off at a relative's house or something. Your mom wouldn't mind? She gives rides home to my friends all the time after school. I have lots of friends. We should really pay for all this stuff. I mean, the shirt, pants, all this food, and the camera? I'll keep a list, and we can come back later and explain why we took it. I need to find a phone. I think we should hitch a ride and find a town. No. No, I'm not supposed to hitchhike. It's dangerous. Yeah, well, you didn't want to swim either. Yeah, and look where that got me. What are you doing? Stand right there. Our first house.

A countersuit that exposes Erbach's vulnerability to carry out his responsibility to shareholders. I'm sorry. I should just take that. Do you mind holding one moment? Marcie? Sorry. No interruptions. I thought we... Your daughter is on the line. She says it's an emergency. What kind of emergency? She didn't say. I have your mother for you. Yeah. Just a minute, hon. Mom? Hello, honey. Is everything all right? Mom, I really need to come home. Okay, would you please just tell me what's going on, honey? Are you having trouble with the other kids? They're hypocrites. I don't think that's a real reason to come home, do you? I've got to come home now, Mom. Isn't there somebody you can talk to? What about the camp counselor? You said she was nice. She is okay. All right. Three weeks. You just have to stick in there for three weeks, and then we're gonna go on a little road trip. We had a deal, right? Right? I've got to come home now, Mom. Please? Honey. Honey, stop crying. You're not a baby anymore. Let's let the girls work this out. I'm out. I don't know, Mom. I'm in a real tough situation. There is a... There is a parents' weekend coming up, isn't there, with fireworks? Saturday. But you said you weren't coming. Well, I'm gonna come now. All right, two days. I just need you to show me that you can handle this, honey. Tough times never last, tough people do. Remember? I know. Tough. Tough. Saturday. I'm gonna see you on Saturday. I love you, honey. Bye. Hello? I have Mr. Russell on the line. Mr. Russell? Who is that? The director of Camp Tall Pine. Camp Tall Pine. Okay, could you put him through? And can you send Mr. Peck back in, please? Yes, ma'am. Hello? She can't come. Not until Saturday. Saturday? I have to go back to camp. Did you tell her what they did to you? My mom and I don't communicate very well. Wants me to be tough. I try. I really try. How much money do we have left? I made a collect call, so I got the quarter back. You want to get a hot dog? You want to split a hot dog and a cola? I want some potato chips. Fricking hippie kids. Yeah, what? Here you go. Excuse me? Excuse me? Yeah? A hot dog and some pota-- potato chips, please. Yeah. Dave! Want to get some new clothes? How? There is only that one rude guy at the snack bar over there. Where is your mom and dad? Do you have money? He has to sell food and take people's clothes by himself. If you can keep him busy, I can sneak back there and get a couple of baskets. What if he catches us? If we can't run faster than him, then we deserve to get caught. How much money do we have left? 16 cents. 16 cents? That's it? I thought we had enough to buy something else. Get lost! Go away! Don't come back without money! Come on! Wait a second. There. There what? You distract Oscar Mayer Wiener over there. Tell him you found a rock in your hot dog. But it's just a... There you go. Excuse me... Sir? I was eating this hot dog when I took a bite and found this rock inside. Sure you did. Get lost, kid. I was thinking perhaps... You want your money back? No, not really. I... I want another hot dog. You want me to give you another hot dog. Yeah, I want another hot dog. Yeah, well, you're not getting one! I want another hot dog. Why is it the bug is always in the last bite? It was not a bug. It was a rock. You give me another hot dog, or I'll... Can I get a hot dog? I'll call the cops. You're gonna call the cops? I want a hot dog. Buddy, just give the kid another hot dog! Listen, pal, if you knew the grief that these kids give me... We are hungry, all right? So let's pick up the pace. Pick up the pace? That was close. Not that close. Here is your stuff. Smells kind of good. Probably want to check with the counselors first. Well, okay. I think I see... So, do I look like one of them? Unfortunately, you do. Come on. I'll be right back, Mom. All right, honey. Did you put on the underwear? Didn't you? I picked them up and they were warm. I just couldn't do it. Well, hers were clean and everything. You said they smelled good, remember? What are you smiling about? You dope! Pull your pants up. Hey! Come on! What if we glued their shoes to the floor? I've had my shoelaces tied and glued to the floor once. That's good too. Or we could take their underwear and tie it to the flagpole. Why do boys like underwear and poop jokes? Because they're funny. So not funny. Come on! Come on! Let's get going. Hey! You! Cut that out! But it just stole my quarter. I'll give you another. Just don't hit the machine! I really, really need to go, like, really bad. Hi. What you got, Margo? Thanks for meeting me. We need to hand out these fliers. What do we do? I don't want to go back yet. All right. We have to get out of here. Come on. Hurry up. Come on. Come on, kids. Come on, kids, get on the bus. Quit horsing around. Come on. Come on! Come on. Everybody, come on. Let's go! Hurry up. Here we go. Let's just go. I'm gonna start right here. Maybe you could take these down the other end. We're looking for these kids. Have you seen them? What are you doing in our seats? Yeah. Get out our seats. Get up. Come on, get up. Come on. Any day now. No, no. Hold up. Sit down. These are our seats. Mind your business. Just let them be, okay? I'll handle this, ladies. Why you sweating them? Gonna have to kick somebody else out, 'cause they ain't moving. Grab a seat so we can get going. Come on, get up. Come on. Thank you, thank you. Hey. 41, 42. 42? Let's go, Chuck. Hang on. I've got two too many. Are any of you supposed to be on the other bus? This is not a tough question. Anybody? On the other bus, bus two? Hey, dude, you want to get out? That's us, man. We're supposed to be on the other bus. Well, let's go, okay? Quit horsing around! You guys are holding us up. I don't understand what's going on. It's been hours since I spoke to her. Where could she be? Well, I think we have to consider the possibility that she is on the run. On the run? Mr. Russell, she is 12 years old. She was your responsibility. You understand that, don't you? No one is more aware of that than I am, all right? I am just as concerned about your daughter's well-being as you are. Did she tell you that she was coming directly back to camp? No, not in as many words. I... I told her that I would meet her here on Saturday for parents'... weekend. I see. Are you suggesting that she won't be back until Saturday? That this is somehow my fault? No. Believe me, this is not the time for blame or panic. I'm panicked. I sent her here so she could have fun and make friends. We provide functions and socialization skills, but the foundation for a strong young woman must be built in the home. It doesn't happen at camp in six weeks. Okay. Can you just tell me what happened? Some children don't take to camp right away, so the campers decided, mistakenly, that they could improve your daughter... by putting her in a situation where she might realize that we are all just people. Improve my daughter? What the hell are you talking about? They marooned her on the little island about a mile off the campsite. Marooned her? They marooned her? I know what that sounds like, but I don't think any harm was meant. I mean, we are... We're used to the carrot-top jokes, but this... This is criminal. Mrs. Golden, when I became director three years ago, I put a stop to this business, but traditions die hard. I mean, some of these campers are third generation, if you believe it. I was a goat. What? When I was a camper... They call the island Goat Island, and I was marooned and... and... I was a goat. I was scared at first, but it all worked out. See? We have to find her. You understand? Absolutely. We have to find her right now. The sheriff's office, the local police, and the county juvenile division are all engaged in a coordinated effort to secure your daughter's safety. I understand how you must be feeling. No. You don't. I wanted to go Space Camp. Why didn't you? Mom didn't want me going to Houston by myself. She said it was too far and she'd take me to NASA later. You want to be an astronaut? Think so. I want to be so high that I can put my thumb up and blot out the Earth. Sounds stupid, right? No. Not stupid at all. Boys, go right, follow Vince, okay? Girls? Go to my left and follow Miss Higgins. We can't split up! I'll slip away from the crowd. Here you go. I got some more right here. No matter what you do, always look like you know what you're doing. Be sure to bring all your personal belongings. Over here! Hey, man, what you doing? Let go of me! Think you can just walk? Let go of me! Where you going to? Into the wild woods? Okay, man, be cool! Get off! I think we need to tell Mr. Carlson. Please don't do that. You got somewhere to go? We're going back to our camp. Your camp? Where is that? It's near here. It's gonna get dark and scary out there real soon. There is wolves and bears out there. We can't just let you go. She is scared. We are not afraid. Look, why don't we just keep them for the night? Nobody knows them, not even Carlson. Even got the camp shirt now. You stay tonight. Susie Burns is in my cabin. She gonna make some noise about this. We have to stay together. You can't stay together tonight. This is a separated camp. Boys with the boys and girls with girls. We should head back up. Come on. Who are they? You don't know them? Never seen them before. They're always hanging with us. This is Bonnie and her brother Clyde. You must have seen them. Come on, let's go. Tiwanda, what's up with your new friend? She is staying with us tonight. There is not enough beds. She is my guest! This is Susie Burns. There is nine of us and only eight beds. Where is she gonna sleep? She gonna sleep with me. She is gonna get us in trouble. She ain't gonna get you in trouble, Susie, 'cause you don't know nothing about her being here, do you? It's cool, Susie. It's just for tonight. And you can have first dibs on what bed you want. Okay. 1, 2, 3, 4, I declare a thumb war. Your hair is messy. Want to borrow my comb? Thanks. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Are you okay? I'm okay. I think we have to spend the night here and then leave in the morning. It's getting dark, and we don't know where we are. Come morning, we are so out of here. Okay, okay, settle down, people! Come on, get a seat! We have a few things to go over, and then you can start having fun. No, no, no. I did not pawn her off so that I could work. Excuse me? Excuse me? We agreed that this would be good for her. Yes. Yes, it is a big case. So what? And that... That is why I am taking her on a trip to Houston after this so that she can go and see NASA. Okay, David. David, you're her father. You don't even know that she likes rockets and outer space. Yeah, well, she likes other planets more than she likes this one, David. And you know what? I'm starting to understand why. No, I have no idea why she wouldn't want to call you and your new wife in Hawaii. I've gotta go, okay? I'll call you when I find her, okay? Bye. Come on, Clyde, let's you and me dance. I don't dance very well. Oh, come on, Clyde. No! No! Get your butt on the dance floor with me. Hey, Bonnie, you and me, what do you say? Let me be your everything. Let's dance. I don't know. I... Oh, come on.

No. There is only one real man here, and I can't see him, because I don't have a mirror. Look, Bonnie, blow this jerk off here. He ain't taking care of you. Shut up! Look, Clyde. You keep flapping your mouth, and I will make sure it shuts permanently. And I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to the lady here. You're a punk, Clyde. Punk ass. No! Punk! Okay, break it up! What's going on here? Butch fell, sir. Don't give me that. What happened, Butch? I... I fell down. I have a bad knee. We were just horsing around. Party is over. What? Everybody back to the cabins. You okay? Can you get up? That Clyde is super bad. See those eyes? Bedroom eyes. He is like that... Richard Gere out of that Officer movie, sweeping his woman off her feet. I'm not his woman. Oh, come on. We're just friends, really. Well, if you're just friends, send him in my direction. Bed check, ladies! Lights out! What happened to your arm? My dad used to drink a lot. When I'd make too much noise or make a mistake, he'd burn me. With what? His cigarette. I just don't get why people do it. Do what? Hurt people. I mean, you actually end up feeling worse when you hurt someone. That's the problem. What do you mean? Some people like it. They have this weird power trip thing. Like your dad? Yeah, I guess so. Do you wish that you didn't have a dad? Sometimes I do. Sometimes I wish I had a big brother to help me out when I need it. The Protector. Yeah, a brother would be cool. I want you to promise me that as soon as you get to town tomorrow, you call your mom. You call her and tell her that she has to come get you right away. I don't care what you say. Just make her come, okay? You can't keep hiding like this. Okay. Tiwanda? Can I ask you a question? Sure. Why are you being so nice to me? Why wouldn't I? I don't know. Just because. We got all this paint, all those different colors, and we'll hang it up in the Rec Hall. Thanks for last night. We've gotta get out of here. I promised Tiwanda I would call my mother when we get into town, so she can come get me. Are you gonna call her? Maybe she'll let you come too. I don't think your mom would want me coming with you. She'll let you come. I know she will. Just ask your parents. I guess I could. We could go to the movies and stuff. The Museum of Science and Industry is just a couple miles away from my house. They have lots of cool exhibits and things. They have this big heart that you can walk into. And they have all these little people sliced up in thin little slices. They're stuck in these glass doors, and when you turn the doors, you can see everything, all their insides. Are they real people? Like, really real? Yeah. There is a man and a lady all sliced up. But where'd they get the bodies? I mean, who'd want to be cut up and displayed like that? I don't know. Never really thought about it before. I bet they didn't have families. Maybe they were war prisoners. Maybe. That's disgusting? Hey, what about a picture? All right, hold still. Hold on a second. This won't work. We're not sleeping in the woods tonight unless we have to. Wait. You see that? He didn't stop at the office. It's one of those places where you pay when you check in. You leave the key in the room when you leave. But they always close the door when they leave. Yeah? Well, we'll wait until the next one. I'll give it a try. Wait. I should do it. I look more innocent. Can we please get going? We've got to get moving. Let's get a soda. Four bags and a Teddy bear. Can you please get the rest of the stuff in the trunk and everything? I got it, I got it. Mr. Jones? It's Hendricks. Sorry, wrong party. Are you leaving? I hope you had a pleasant stay with us. Yeah. Well, it was great. Thank you very much. Make sure you have the stroller, please. I've got it. Can you get it in the back of the car? Make sure that it's not gonna bounce around back there. I got it. It's back there. Thank you, thank you. We are gonna be late. Relax. I'll be right back. Come on! I've got to check something. I was just making sure we didn't forget something. Sure. Have a nice day. You too. What now? Yes? I'm sorry, Mr. Hendricks, but did you forget to leave your key? Clifford. Sorry about that. Thank you, Mr. Hendricks. Have a nice day. Okay. Thanks. Hurry! The cleaning lady may come. Put something on the door. I need to think about this a minute. Don't look at me. Go stand someplace else. Front desk. Hello. This is Mrs. Hendricks in Room 108. How can I help you? We would like to stay another night. Is that possible? Yes. What's the problem? Yes, we... Our car broke down, and we need to leave it at the garage overnight. I'm sorry. Yes. Great. Same credit card? Yes, that would be fine. Good-bye. Thank you very much. Bye now. Bye. Yes! Yes! Oh, my gosh, I did it! I did it! What are you doing? Beating you up! Cut it out! Cut it out! What did they say? "No problem, Mrs. Hendricks. Just stop by before you leave tomorrow." Really? Is that what they said? Yes. I'm brilliant, don't you think? I guess. Stop it! Say it! Okay, okay! Say it! Okay. I'm brilliant. So you are funny? Cut it out! Say it! Okay, you are brilliant. Message One. Mom? Grace. I'm okay. I didn't tell you before, but I'm not at camp anymore. I'm sorry. I'm with this boy. His dad is an archaeologist and stuff. We can't go back to camp anymore, Mom. They did something really cruel to us. Did you tell her? What? Did you tell her about the island? Mom, they took all of our clothes, even our underwear. They left us on an island, then they tried to spy on us. We hate them. I mean that. Tomorrow when you come, we will meet you in the front of the main entrance next to the covered bridge. He has to come home with us, okay? He thinks his parents are in Greece. Please make it okay, Mom. Please make it okay. And I am being tough, Mom. I am, I swear. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Mom? Do you ever wonder why they picked you? Picked me? Yeah. Bryce and the others. I'm an easy target. I was just a reject. So you came to the island to ditch Julia Christiansen? I'm socially retarded for my age. I don't really have a lot of friends back home. I lied. That's okay. Would you have helped Julia if they chose her? I'm not sure. Did you know that Bryce classifies all girls? You know, super fine foxes, foxes, middle-of-the-roads, dogs, and real dogs? What was I? He said that you were a dog. But he didn't even really look at you though. He couldn't have. He wouldn't have said that if he really looked at you. I feel gross. I'm gonna go take a shower. You were right. This is way better than sleeping in the woods. Yeah, it is. Where is your brother? He is out tonight with friends. Can I get you something to drink? No, no, that's okay. I like your glasses. I hate them. I remember when I first got them. I could read all the street signs. I rode home on the bus and read them aloud. The kids thought I was crazy. I did the same thing. Everything was just so clear. Do you know something? What? I should have asked you before, but I didn't. What? I don't know your name. I'm so sorry. It's okay. It's kind of a stupid name. Howie. I'm Grace. My birth certificate says Shadow Golden.

No, thanks. Now, I know I don't look proper. Probably don't smell proper, but got nothing to be afraid of, see? Look. Deputy sheriff. So you got nothing to worry about. Come on. You can use my help...clearly. Get in. Come on. There you go. There you go. There you go. Smoke? My name is Hofstadder. Perry Hofstadder. And you two are going to Ahlburg? Yes. What's your name? Howie. Howie? Well, I am sorry about the smell, Howie. Goats. I had a goat in the back seat yesterday, and it still stinks. There is nothing that stinks more than a dirty goat. Am I right? Isn't Ahlburg that way? Yeah. Yeah, it's that way. But I'm going to... stop at my house and pick up a few things. You're not in any rush, are you, Howie? You two are the ones that jumped camp the other day, aren't you? What are you doing out here? How the hell did you get to Barnesville? We got a ride, and we're going back now. They know we're coming back, 'cause we called them. They're waiting for us. Sure, they are. What have you two been up to? Been out here getting frisky? Swapping spit? It's none of your business. What did you say? We want to get out! It's very much my business. It is very much my business. Stop the car here! Cool it, hot shot! Let us out! You might say you two are under a bit of arrest. You're the two that broke into the Starlight Motel. That is a serious offense. And you two are gonna need all the help you can get, you and the jailbait here. I'm gonna go make a phone call. Stay put. What's gonna happen to us? Are they gonna put us in juvenile jail? No. I don't even think this guy is a... Shut up! He is weird. Should we try to run? He's got a gun. I don't even think this guy is a real sheriff. What do you think? You think we can make it? Can you drive? Yeah, it's Perry. You're not gonna believe it. Let me talk to the boss. Yeah, there are some others that make... Okay, hang on. Wait. All right! No! No! Go! Go! He is coming! I can't reach the pedal. Drive! Wrong way! Here he comes. Hit the gas! What did we hit? I think I ran over his foot. Good! Stop! Wrong way! Wait! Stop! What did he say? I think he said something about wrong way. Wrong way? Stop! Stop! No gas! Hit the brakes! Stop! Stop! Stop! Hit the brakes! I'm trying! I'm trying to. We gotta get out of this car. Go! Wait! Stop! Come on! Wait! Stop! You're going the wrong way. Stop! Stop! Please! We have to jump. What? He's got us trapped! He'll shoot us. No, he won't. We ran over his foot. Wait! What do we do? We have to jump. But I told you, I can't swim. If we live, I'll teach you. I can't! Wait! Don't jump! Oh, God! Don't! Ha! Sucker! I know! I love your hair! Mrs. Golden? I'm Sara Gallagher, county juvenile officer. Hi. This is Margo Cutter, Grace's counselor. So where is she? I'm afraid we have a problem. What's wrong? Your daughter and the boy were picked up this morning near Barnesville by one of Sheriff Prosser's deputies. Well then, where are they? Well, we don't exactly know. They stole his truck. What? What? Then they ran over his foot, then they crashed the car near the edge of a cliff. Were they hurt? No, ma'am. Well, then, what happened to her? Where did she go? When the deputy made his way down to the cliff, the kids got nervous, jumped into the water, they swam to shore... Oh, no. Grace can't swim. Howie and Grace did this? Yeah. The sheriff feels his deputy acted inappropriately and will not press charges against the kids. The deputy wasn't in uniform, and perhaps his personality wasn't conducive to the situation at hand. What did he do to them? They wanted to meet me. They're supposed to be here right now. Mrs. Golden, you should go back to your hotel and wait for Grace to call you again. If she comes here, I will call you right away. Listen, everything is gonna be okay. Now, I need to go talk to Mr. Russell, but I'll be back. I'm so sorry about what happened to Grace. She is a really good kid, not like some of the brats we have here. Thank you. Was your mom there? No. My mom is at a hotel in Ahlburg. It was just her secretary. A motel? Here? She's been there since the day before yesterday. Mr. Russell called her when we didn't make it back to camp. She drove straight here. My mom's secretary said that she is really worried about me, and the police are looking for us. My mom is going to be so mad at me. I never thought that Mr. Russell would call her. What was I thinking? Poor Mom. What am I going to tell her? She is going to kill me. I'm not gonna let her do that. I'm gonna call my mom. Her secretary gave me her number. We should probably borrow some money from that honey guy. Think he'll mind? No. We can give him an I.O.U. I'll tell her we have to stay together. If she can't take us both, then... we can run away again if we have to. Maybe. Okay. Hello? Mom? Grace! There was this man. He said he was a deputy. He didn't hurt you, did he, baby? No. He acted real strange. 'Cause you can tell me, Grace. You can tell me anything. We hit him with the truck, but it was an accident. It was really an accident, Mom. It's okay, darling, it's okay. He is all right. He won't bother you anymore, so don't be afraid. I'm not afraid anymore. I'm tough now, like you said. I'm really tough now. Grace, it's not about that. I just...I need to know that you're all right. I'm fine. Honey, where are you? Mom, we have to stay together. Can we take Howie home with us? I'll... I'll do whatever I can. I'll steal him if I have to. Just... Just tell me where you are. His parents said that he could come home with us. Grace, Howie... Howie's parents are not around. I know. They are in Greece. No, no, sweetie. He is part of a program that lets kids come to summer camp. What do you mean? Grace, he lives in a foster home. I'm not sure that he has parents. How do you know that? Because the people who are trying to find you told me. Sweetie, where are you? I don't know. It's pretty here. There are trees and there is a river, phone booth too. There is a man who sells honey. Okay. We have to take Howie home with us. If 5 cents is not deposited within 20 seconds, your call will be automatically terminated. Mom? It's okay, honey. I understand. Grace, is there a number on the pay phone? If 5 cents is not deposited, your call will be automatically terminated. I can't see it. It's all scratched out. Grace, listen to me. If we get disconnected, I want you to dial 9-1-1. Mom? If 5 cents is not deposited, Mom! Mom! your call will automatically terminated. Stay right where you are. I'm gonna find... Mom! Grace? Thanks for coming so fast. Lockwood's Honey Stand is out near the county bridge. They are not far. Okay, let's go. Where are we going? Mom said to wait where we were near the honey stand. She promised me that you could come home with us. No, she didn't mean it. What do you mean? Yes, she did. She couldn't. It's against the law! What is? Us. That's crazy. Did they say anything about my parents coming? No, she didn't. We should probably head back down now. I mean, there is no place else to go. I'm not going back there. I can't. You go! I never said you had to come with me in the first place. I thought we were supposed to stay together. Well, we aren't! What do you mean? I don't need you. I don't want you anymore. I never really needed you, so just go. Go! You take that back. You take it back! I take it back. I take it back! Okay. I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. You know I didn't mean it. I know. You shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry I broke your glasses. It's okay. Can you see all right? No, not really. Everything is a little fuzzy. It's okay. I've got spare ones back at the camp. You know... there is something I've been wanting to tell you. What? I had this idea that... you and me could live in the woods together, sort of like Indians. We could get stuff that we needed from... I don't know, fields and cottages. And no one would ever bother us again. I thought about that a lot these past few days. I just wanted to tell you. Thought you might think I was just crazy. Yeah, it's crazy. It's nice to think about though. You'd have to build a raft and head downriver... unless you could teach me how to swim. You could teach me, right? I think so. What if one of us got sick or something? I don't know. I never really thought about that. You would think of something. You always do. Your mom is gonna be worried when you are not down there. She'll get over it. Thank you. Thank you so much. Good afternoon. Excuse me, Mr. Lockwood. Have you seen a young girl and boy here about a half an hour ago? They might have used your pay phone? I've seen them. Are they okay? Yes. They're both fine. Okay. Are you here to pay me? What do you mean, pay you? No, I can pay you. I'm her mother. Shadow's mother. Well, you don't have to pay me, Ms. Golden. Then you'd want the I.O.U. and... I'd rather have this little I.O.U. They headed up that dirt road. There is my mom. Grace! Grace! Honey! Grace! Honey! Grace! Mom! Mom! Grace! Mom! It's okay. It's all right. It's okay. I'm right here. It's okay. Are you all right? The boys tried to make us feel small. In a weird way, it did just the opposite. I wasn't afraid anymore, and Howie wasn't alone. God has a way of giving you what you need when times get tough. In the fall, Howie found a family that adopted him in Connecticut. We stayed in touch, and the next summer, Mom took us to the museum to see the cut-up people. And then to NASA to see the rockets. ♪ Did you see ♪ Me standing there in the corner? ♪ ♪ I was alone ♪ I always am at these big parties ♪ ♪ Watching you ♪ Watching everybody ♪ Wishing I was more outgoing ♪ Wishing I was dressed up pretty ♪ ♪ Wallflower ♪ I'm not here ♪ No one sees me ♪ Wallflower ♪ I'm by myself ♪ Please excuse me ♪ But there you were ♪ Standing in your own corner ♪ ♪ Your eyes were wide ♪ Tired, fading just like mine ♪ ♪ We could be ♪ The best of friends, I'm sure of it ♪ ♪ But I'm too shy ♪ To cross this crowded room besides ♪ ♪ Wallflower ♪ I'm not here ♪ No one sees me ♪ Wallflower ♪ I'm by myself ♪ Please excuse me ♪ Help me leave this corner of the room ♪ ♪ I'm reaching out to you ♪ 'Cause I've got things I could talk to you about ♪ ♪ And we could be ♪ Wallflower friends ♪ Till the end ♪ Wallflower friends ♪ Till the end ♪ I'm sure of it ♪ Wallflowers ♪ We're not here ♪ No one sees us ♪ Wallflowers ♪ We're together ♪ Please excuse us
