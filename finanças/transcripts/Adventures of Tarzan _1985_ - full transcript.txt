[BIRDS CHIRPING] Darling, we are wandering in this jungle since eight months! We are not wandering, darling. We are searching the traces of tribes and civilizations... ...of Shakabhumi that are lost in the shadow of time. We are here right now. And Shakabhumi must be somewhere nearby. [BIRDS CHIRPING] You go to bed. I'll go in search of Shakabhumi for a while. And don't worry, darling. It's just a matter of another 10-12 days. We can go home after that. Okay? I promise. [FOOT STEPS APPROACHING] Raina... Raina, get up. Get up, Raina. Get up... You can't leave me alone! Get up, Raina! Get up! Get up, Raina! Get up! No! [CRYING] [SCREAM] Hey! What's that? I think, he's Tarzan. NEWS: According to the PTI correspondent... ...that legend of ape-man alias Tarzan is not a fictional tale... ...but it's a true story. Mr. Shetty, who along with his team has been searching... ...the traces of 4000 year old town Shakabhumi... ...in the jungles of Chamunda. One of his teammate Kumar has seen that beast... ...or human being from a distance of two kilometers. That species was fighting with an animal. But according to Mr. Shetty when Kumar... ...saw this creature he was in a drunken state. But Mr. Shetty also said that in spite of his alcohol-addiction... ...Kumar has always been giving reliable news. It seems that, once again, Tarzan's story is about to be... ...in news for some time. [BIRDS CHIRPING] - Scotch, please. - D.K. hello! Hello! My name is, Krishnakant Verma. - So you want to go for a hunt? - No. Then? - I am the owner of Apollo circus. - Congrats! You are going on hunting the day after tomorrow, aren't you? I too have some work, at the place where you will be going. I will pay for all the expenses of the trip. And if you get my job done, I will pay you... ...another one lakh. What's your work? The way you catch tigers, lions... ...and elephants you have to catch that ape-man... ...that is Tarzan for my circus. Tarzan? What will you do with him? Actually all the shows of my circus have become stale. The animals are old and fusty. Tarzan, will be the new animal of my circus. He will show new tricks. There will be some exclusive shows. And there will be a new excitement among people. He will be a new prey for me. Interesting. - One lakh? - Yes. And all the expenses paid in any currency that you want. Very interesting. Tarzan. [SLURRING] Stop the cart. - Hey, listen! - Who is it? I need to go to Shakabhumi. Will you take me there? No. I have money, a lot of money. Let's go. [LAUGHING] - Today the luck is on our side. - We got the girl and the money. [LAUGHING] Who will come to her rescue? [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] Let's go. Do, what we say. What do you mean? Do not worry. We will come one at a time. And I will kill you one at a time. [GROANING] [SEAGULL YELLING] Hey... [WHIRRING] [HORN BLARE] She's here. Silver queen is here. She is here. [BIRDS CHIRPING] - You? - I am Ruby. I know who you are. But why did you come here? I had to come here to tell you, that I hate you. You traveled 15,000 km to tell me that you hate me? [CRICKETS CHIRPING] One entire lifetime is not even sufficient for love. Did you get me? - D.K. come. - Hi, Mr. Shetty. Come. - Meet my daughter, Ruby. - Hello! D.K.! - Hello. - How do you do? When her mother and I got separated... - ...she was just one year old. - That's a lie. You abandoned my mother. Excuse me, Mr. Shetty! Come. You don't know, how many hardships your wife... ...my mother had to face to bring me up. Look, dear, when a marriage breaks... ...it is not a single person's fault. Both the husband and wife are equally to be blamed. Now when you will know me better, you will know that... ...neither I was completely wrong, nor was your mother... ...completely right. But... How did she let you come to me? Because... She is dead. And before dying she told me to meet my dad... ...and to tell him to forgive her, if she had done anything wrong. [CRYING] I am sorry, dear. I am sorry. [BIRDS CHIRPING] - Good morning. - Good morning. - Tea for you. I prepared it. - Thank you. - Where is everyone going? - Upwards. Towards Janguta jungle. Your father in search of Sakabhumi... ...and I in search of Tarzan. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [HOWLING] Listen! This is the last cliff of this region. Climb one by one. Be careful. [GASPS] [HOWLING] [SCREAM] Lord! Rest his soul in peace. [RIVER GURGLING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] It seems that we've reached our destination. Come... - D.K., let us camp here. - Yes, sir.

[SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] - Dad, who's that? - Tarzan. Tarzan's a strange guy. There are a number of legends about him. Dear, his voice echoes in all the corners of this jungle. Many years ago, I heard about him. One of Dr. Watt's guide, saw a boy of 7-8 years... ...climbing a hill at a breakneck speed. From then onwards his name resonates in these jungles. Some tribes are scared of him, some worship him. Some think, Tarzan is a wandering spirit. Some think that their ancestors spirit... ...come in the form of Tarzan to protect them... ...and disappears after protecting them. Some say, he's 100 ft tall. Some say, he's 200 ft tall. Mr. Shetty, these are all stories. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] Tarzan is the child of a human being... ...who might have lost him when Tarzan was a kid. I am about to catch Tarzan and take him to the circus... - ...like an animal. - But, listen... - They are refusing to go forward. - Why? - All of them are scared. - Scared of animals? Yes. They are scared of animals and animals are... ...scared of fire. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Let's enjoy. - Yes. "Everyone hit the dance floor." "Sing and dance and have fun." "Everyone hit the dance floor." "Sing and dance and have fun." "Oh my beloved one." "I am indulging in a new madness." "Add a new dimension to your life." "Let's dance and have fun."

He's a human being. Look, Ruby. From today onwards you will do... ...what I will ask you to do, right? Number 1: From today onwards you will never... ...step out alone. Number 2: You will keep this pistol with you all the times. Take it. And if you ever come across Tarzan again... - ...you will shoot him at sight. - But, daddy, how can I... That's my order, okay? [BIRDS CHIRPING] Come. Come. [SCREAM] What happened? Mr. Shetty, Tarzan kidnapped a girl from our group. Help! Leave me... It doesn't matter if he's an animal or a human being. Now I won't leave Tarzan alive anymore. - Mr. Shetty, the locals we hired want to go back. - What! Yes. Mr. Shetty, double the money you offered them. Okay. [GUNSHOTS] Mr. Shetty... Mr. Shetty, we didn't get the girl. But... See this. It belongs to the Shakabhumi tribe. [TRIBAL TRADITIONAL DRUMS PLAYING] Get ready to move forward.

It's already too late in the day. How will I go back now? I don't even know the paths of the jungle. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Mr. Shetty, you go that way and I will go this way. We will fire after every five minutes. If Ruby is alive she will know that we are near her... ...and she will try to run in our direction. I don't think that beast will leave her alive. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Who else do you have? Your mother. Your father. Your brothers and sisters. You don't have anyone? Not even a friend? Oh! How shall I make you understand it? Wow! He is your friend? Friend. He is called a friend. Do you have a lot of friends? Where are all of them? "Will you come to me?" "Will you dance with me?" "Will you swing with me?"
