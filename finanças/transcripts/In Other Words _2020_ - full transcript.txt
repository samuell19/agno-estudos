Jack? Patty? This is you. Yes, this is you. Yeah! Hey, you look just like your picture. - Wow! - Oh my God! Jack, I love the Titanic. - That's my favorite movie. - Oh my God! - Yeah. Yeah, I know. Mine too. - Yeah? I love when Jack drowns. Oh. - Yes, it's a really... - That's a little morbid. It's an emotional moment in the movie. I like sixty-five... Oh, you're smart. True? Veronica? - Hey. Oh... - Oh... I'm a hugger. Oh, um, well, please sit. I got you a chai latte. Your profile said you like them so... That's so thoughtful. - Yeah. - sorry. Do you have a cold? Uh no, no. I just, um, sometimes I get nervous. Don't be nervous. I don't bite. Hey... you know, enough about me. Um, what about you? You're a, uh, veterinarian dentist? Wh... what's that like? Much like humans. I brush their teeth, do cleanings; things like that. Don't you ever get bitten? Occasionally... But I started to bite back. Ugh! Oh! Oh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! That's so terrible! It's okay. - True, it... it happens. - Oh, you know what? Actually, I just... I got a text message from a client. I completely spaced that I have to meet with her... him... her... Herman. Um... You're great. Buh-bye. That's all yours, if you want green tea. It's peach flavored... Um... True? It doesn't work. - The app's not ready yet. - What? Who... where's Benny? 3:30, you know him. Like clockwork, nature calls. Jesus, Benny, you could set a clock to your bowel movements. I take dumps. I don't have bowel movements. We can't go up there. The app isn't working. What are you talking about? The beta tests are going incredible. The algorithm still needs some tweaking. It's not matching me with the right girls. This is no time to be second-guessing our... Wait. It happened again? How the hell are you still awkward around chicks, bro? Someday, you gotta come out from behind the screen and learn how to talk to women. Shut up, Kiki! I can talk to women. Your names, please? I'm... This is True Andrews... I'm Benjamin Vaswani. And this is our lawyer, Kiki. Ahem. I mean, Enrique. Calderon. Yes, here you are. Mr. Woods is on the sixth floor. Thank you, sweetheart. Remember what we practiced. You see a pretty girl in there, you imagine that girl's head on a turkey, your grandma... twerking, but you do not lose your cool in this meeting! You hear me? I'll see you guys up there. Whoa! Whoa! Hey, hey! That's six flights up, dude. Fear of women, fear of enclosed spaces. You have a fear of success too? This is all in your head. You know this. I don't have achievemephobia. But Claustrophobia and Venustraphobia are real conditions. Ask my doctor. Your pediatrician doesn't count! I'd like to thank you all for linking your social media profiles in advance. "Compatible" now has enough information to find each of you a match. So, all I have to do is press this little heart? Yes, Mr. Woods. Call me Maximillion. Yes, Mr. Maximillion. Please touch the hearts and watch "Compatible" find your match. We've taken your profile information and caused it to create over 25 points of compatibility including daily routines, food preferences, likes and shares, to match you with someone who likes the same things. Well, I doubt it could find a match for me 'cause I'm a man of EXTRAORDINARY taste and bizarre pleasures. Oh, wow! Aaahh! "Compatible"... can find someone for everyone. Wait, who the heck is... Betty? Extraordinary! I don't have any matches. You won't always find a partner within close proximity... But you can adjust this by changing your environment. Take the dog for a walk, for example. Or go get a cup of coffee. My partner, True Andrews, will now talk a little more about the future of "Compatible"; the art of letting love find you. The soft launch of "Compatible" was successful with 100,000 downloads in just a few hours. We're now in Mexico, Canada, and soon to be launching in Japan and Europe. How do you propose to sustain market penetration and market share when your competitors have deep pockets and are years ahead? Well, the unique features that combine proximity with routine make potential love matches that other apps don't. Well, it figured I'm a germaphobe and it matched me with the cleaning lady. I mean, that is pretty neat. It really is. That's like up there on the list of neat. Julie, uh, be sure to get her phone number because I want to test this theory tonight. Hmm? Sorry I'm late. Her head on a turkey. Hi, True. Um... ahem. Um... the um... the algorithm of "Compatible" takes the... the guesswork out of... of going out. No more striking out because now you only approach people that actually want to talk to you. Yeah. Ooohh oh. Twerking, man. Ahem. Mm. Oh. Um-um, no more lonely nights swiping left and... and right and hoping, because with "Compatible", it can even help even the most awkward person find love with just a simple touch of the boobs... I was... I was going to say... I... Hmm... I am so sorry. Don't! Just don't! We just lost millions of dollars because you're mentally 12 years old. I'll fix it. I'll call... No! You will not make this worse! I'm not gonna make this worse! Sometimes I wonder why I ever partnered with you. You do this every time! Hey! Come on. I don't do this every time. Remember in college when I fell in the pool and I... and I was floundering around like some helpless animal and... and you still got laid? Hey! Hey! Hey! Shut up! They're calling. It's them! Enrique Calderon. Yes. Uh-huh. Of course. I'll tell them. Thank you. KIKI? Don't make me climb back there and beat it out of you. Spit it out! Well, looks like you've done it again. After all those hours of hard work, they want to invest in the app! Oooh-oh. To the two luckiest bastards I know. You know what? You know what? This milestone requires a much bigger celebration. What'd you have in mind? A-a-a full-on gods of Hollywood weekend, bitches! Yeah! I have a client who has a fat pad on the Sunset Strip. Says I can use it whenever I want. Let's go. - Yeah! - I mean, I... I'd love to, guys. but the app's still not a hundred percent. Um, you know, you two go. I'm just gonna stay and work on the app. What? Are you joking? Hell yes, I'm joking! We're going to LA. Angelica? Uh-uh, I'm True. I can't believe we're a match. Are you there with them? They're with you? No hablo inglès. You don't speak English? Oh, my gosh! I'm so stupid. Of course! I... I forgot to add a language quotient to the match variable. That's... that's probably a good thing because I'm usually really bad with girls. I mean, I... I... I talk too much. When I get nervous, I say the wrong thing. But not right now, probably because I'm a little bit hammered. I mean, I'm not wasted. I mean, I'm not like I'm an alcoholic or anything. You wanna... you like dance? Dance? Si. Cool. Oh! An- hel- ica. An- hel- ica. True. True. True. T-r-r-r-oo. Your mouth is so cute when you try and say my name, An-HHHHHelica. Te ves tan raro diciendo mi nombre. ¿Angelica, dónde está la biblioteca? No sé. Eres gracioso. Dos tacos por favor. ¿No mas dos? Uno, dos. Ah. Will you take a selfie with me? Angelica... ya llego el coche. Lo siento. Me tengo que ir. Me diverti mucho. Ooohh la la. Way to go, True! My brother! What happened? She gave me her address. - Yeah! - Noooo! High-five! This looks amazing. What's up, player? Huh? Huh? Did you text her back yet? No, I didn't text her back. Last night was a fluke. Were we even at the same club last night? Yeah. I had an 80 percent match, but she doesn't speak English. How does that work? The less she can understand you, the better. And how long does that last? What happens when she learns English or I learn Spanish? Then I make a fool out of myself in two languages? - No thanks. - True? Please tell me you're kidding! You know what I blame? Yeah. We know! - The algorithm! - The algorithm! I told you. It's not ready. I should've figured this out sooner. Oh, my gosh! What if Maximillion's team finds out? Then... then we could lose the whole deal. Whoa! Stop right there. Don't ever let those words come out of your mouth again. Dude, "Compatible" matched you at 80 percent. You owe it to yourself to at least believe it! But it's ignoring the national distinctions in our launch region. So what? Was she hot? Yes. Then "Compatible" is fine just the way it is. Now, get in the car! We're still celebrating. Back seat! Did he just call back seat? Yep. Tonight, we ride! - You're a unique one, Kiki. This place is massive! It has at least ten bedrooms. I bet you we could fit like a hundred people in there. We can have a party... - What the hell, man! - True! You guys are right. If the algorithm is fine the way it is, then I'm the one that's wrong. Maybe language isn't a barrier for love. I need to see Angelica. We're going to Mexico. - You sure? - Yes! Let's go. Now. Take this exit. That's my boy. That's what I like to hear. Hell, yeah! Let's go to Mexico, bros! - Whoooo! - Whoooo! Yes! Yes! - Whoa... - Whoa, whoa... - Oh, sorry. - Chips all over me. What the hell, Kiki? There's no spare! I knew I shouldn't have gotten a car from your shady uncle. Should've asked for the spare tire option. Spare tire's not an option! Man, this is what I get for trying to be impulsive. ¿Todo bien? I got this. Tenemos un flat tire. You guys gonna be okay? Oh, we don't have a spare. Do you know where we can get one? There's one place here in Valle. Your best bet is Juan. Flat tire in the middle of a vineyard? Looks like you boys are in a grape jam. No worries, boys. We'll give you a lift. But first, we have to drop off this load up at Encuentro Regina. That's exactly the place we're looking for. I'm True Andrews. True. Uh, this is Benny. This is Kiki. My name's Karina Salas, and this is Sabi Segovia. We're pretty full with groceries, but, um, one of you's gonna have to ride on each other's lap. How is this winning? Just don't get too happy. So, what brings you boys to Encuentro Regina? I'm here to see a girl who lives here. Really? Only Regina, the owner, and myself live there full time. What's this girl's name? Angelica. Whoa! What's that look? Nothing. Um, it's just Angelica is the niece of the owner. Uh, Regina's the only woman in the valley to own and run her own winery, and she's very protective of her family. And Sabi is very protective of Dona Regina. He's also the head vintner, and has won the house many medals for his lovely wines. Haven't you, Sabi? And Karina is an amazing chef. Wait, so how did you meet Angelica? I met her last night in San Diego. And you came to see her today? Este buey esta enamorado! Loco for sure, right? You must've really hit it off for her to invite you today. Mm, she didn't exactly invite us. This is a surprise visit? You are one brave boy. When True gets something in his mind, it's impossible to talk him out of it. It's his gift. And his curse. Well, good for you, mijo, 'cause love makes pendejos of us all. Oh, I'm sure she's gonna be really happy to see you, and you can sample our restaurant and enjoy Sabi's wines. Here we are. Ah! This is beautiful. What! There's a band here, man. This is like Shangri-La. This is amazing. Wow. - Oh my God. - Holy crap. Are you guys hungry? Oh. Yeah, we're hungry, thirsty, and culinarily curious. Come on over. So, you're a chef, huh? Oh no, no. I'm just a line cook, but I'm studying at the Culinary Institute in Ensenada so hopefully one day I'll have my own kitchen. Oh, wow! What... what do you recommend? How about I send out some appetizers? Great! Well, just bring a variety and whatever bottle of wine you recommend. Oh, and could you let Angelica know that True is here to see her. Wait, not right now. I mean, if she's busy... it's not... I mean... I... if I'm not... it... it doesn't... you... Surprise. Just let her know, please. Okay. I'll see if I can find her. Can't wait to taste what you've got... like food. Dude, what if she's weirded out? I mean, wouldn't you be freaked out if some guy you met the night before showed up at your place of work? I would. I did not think this through. Just calm down, man. You're too wound up. You've no idea what you're doing, do you? Nope, not one bit. I saw this in that movie Sideways. Ugh, anyway, it's alcohol, bro. It's all good. Cheers guys, to success in our endeavors. - Eyes. - Eyes, eyes. - Eyes. - Eyes. Ah, wow! That is good. Damn good. This was a great idea to come out here, True. I mean, now that we have our deal, we've gotta start getting used to this lifestyle. Don't jinx it, bro. It ain't done 'til the ink is dry. Guys, let's focus on the task at hand. Okay. I see it like this. A. She will see you and like what most women do, make a run for it. Thanks. Or B. She'll be flattered when Karina tells her that someone drove for two hours, dealt with a flat tire to come find her. But they came from San Diego and got a flat tire. I can't ask them to leave. Tell them that I got sick, and I'm not here. Why did you give him your information If you didn't want to see him? I was drunk! And I wanted to have fun for one night. Besides, he was nice... and I never thought he would come. You suck. They seem nice. The chubby one is a bit fresh, but... They seemed alright. Mm. Okay. Ok. Go find out what they do for a living. I don't want another bum in my life. My parents would kill me. Yes? Please? I owe you one. One thousand. Did you find her? Oh, Angelica is actually taking care of some important business, but she wanted me to bring some of her favorite appetizers. She's here? Great. What's this dish? Chimichurri octopus. Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Karina, would you like to sit down? Um, okay. Um, but just for a moment. This is amazing! How! It's actually one of my favorites. So, what's your story? Oh, he's a computer geek, he's a business stiff, and my name is Enrique Calderón, Attorney at Law. Pleased to meet you. True and I have been business partners for years and we developed a dating app. That's cool. I can't bring myself to get on those sites. I feel like a bunch of creeps get on them. - I'm on there. - Exactly. We just landed a big investor. That's why we're here, to celebrate. That's part of the reason why we're here. Right. Angelica. Last night, the app matched them and he's here to see if the connection is a fluke or not. Because if it was a fluke, that means your app doesn't work. See? Karina gets it. Yes, exactly! She's a genius. You're a genius. So, uh, what's her story? I thought you would know everything about her based on your app. You can never know everything. I mean, tell me something I wouldn't know about her. She's a good person. Okay, um, she's here from Mexico City for a short while to learn the wine business. Aunt Regina's husband passed away and they never had any kids. So I think she's being prepared to inherit the business. Ooohh, an heiress. Not too shabby, True. Looks like this match turned out better than we thought, huh? Listen, guys, I gotta get back to the kitchen, but I'm gonna send more appetizers your way. Thank you. Wow! To life. They are the owners of Compatible. They are the owners of the app? Yes. They created it. So they're not bums, They have jobs and money. ¡Hola! ¡Hola! Fancy seeing you here. Uh-um, sorry for dropping in on you like this. We were gonna go to Los Angeles, but then we decided to come here. I was like, "Hey, let's go see Angelica." And then... so we got a car, then we got a flat, and I rode on Kiki's lap, which he oddly liked. But then now you're here and uh, I'm here and we're... wow! You're... you... you look good. Dude, she only speaks Spanish. Thank God. - Come with me. - Yeah. Yeah. It's sweet. I just had to come see you. Gracias. Thanks. - Cheers. - Salud. Oh, you're looking me in the eye. You must know about the seven years of bad sex in Mexico too, huh? ¿Sexo? No. No, no, no. No sexo. I mean... I... I mean eyes like, um... Calm down, True. Mm... I have an idea. Mhmm. Oh whoa! No sexo. Do you have your cell? Oh. Um... - Mhmm. - Okay. I... I was... I... I thought you were just being skanky. I would... shame... I wouldn't have actually minded, but I um... Um... oh! Translator app. Great idea. Skanky. No, no, oh. Oh, ooh. Hmm. Cochina. Sucia. That is not the first thing I wanted you to understand. Un poco. A little. I love that you have a sense of humor. Love? Uh no, no. I'm... not like-like, love, like um... I mean, not... I mean, not right now. I mean, maybe someday. Wow! Oh, mm, uh sex, uh skanky, love. I'm really hitting it out of the park, aren't I? - Oh man. - Ehm... Tengo que regresar a trabajar. I have to get back to work. Maybe I could... I could see you after work? Te puedo ver despues del trabajo? No puedo. I can't. Yeah. Tal vez Mañana. Me puedes acompañar si queires. Maybe tomorrow. I'm going to check out the competition. You can join me if you'd like. Really? Yes! I'd... I'd... I'd love to. Yeah. ¿Nos vemos a las diez? - Uh... ten? - Mhmm. Yes, I'll... I'll meet you here. Or there or... Anywhere really that you are at. I'll be there. - Okay. - Okay. - See you then. - Bye. Ten, bye. Who's that? A friend. A friend? With those hungry eyes? Oh, Auntie. Look, your parents sent you here to focus on business. Not to keep losing your head over another boy. But Auntie, this time It's different. He's not a poor boy like Daniel. It's not important what he has or what Daniel doesn't have. What's important is what you have when there isn't a Daniel or a... - What's his name? - True. Wow! Sabi's got some moves. There you guys are. Speaking of moves, how'd it go? Seeing her tomorrow at ten. - Nice! - No, you're not. We're leaving tonight. We... Sorry, boys. They didn't have the right size, but Juan's going into town to buy the right tire tomorrow. There you go. We can't leave anyway. We don't have a place to stay. You say it like it's my fault. It IS your fault. If we weren't out here chasing some tail... Done! They had one room left and I just booked it. So you guys shut up and let's drink the night away. Yeah! And if you dummies will excuse me, I have a señorita who's giving me the eye, huh? Whooo! Mm, Kiki? - Ugh! Ugh, mm. Ugh... - ooh, oh. My head is pounding. We must've been up until four in the morning. We went to bed by 11:30. What! No way. Yep. We shut the place down. We're party animals. Can you believe this place? Okay True, it's do or die time. You close on this girl today and we go home. Understand? We don't have time for this Lost in Translation crap. We can always come back, right? Uh-mm. You think Karina'll give me her number? Sure. Let's focus on this car thing and get some breakfast, huh? Good morning, boys. Hey, Sabi. What are you doin'? Um, makin' a wound to see if it bleeds. If it releases this water-like substance called xylem fluid, it's not ready. So, you wound the grape to see if it's ready? Yeah. Well, a mature grape can handle the scar. What's your plan with Angelica? Um, I'm goin' on a date with her in a bit. After he's done, we leave. Love can't be nurtured with one date. Love? Who said anything about love? Until you experience the kind of love that punches you in the gut and leaves you breathless with a simple thought of her, not only have you not lived a true life, you haven't become a true man. Ah. Ah. Look at these vines. The mother vine is a hundred years old. Came from Italy. A cutting takes three years to make good grapes. You can't rush it, son. You can't rush love. Well, maybe you can give True a few tips, 'cause he doesn't have a hundred years. Well, there's no more important business than love. But you have to be patient. You have to nurture it, savor every moment and you have to figure out what she really wants. You know what they say about wine and women? The cheap ones gives you headaches. Right? When love is ready, you will know. What's 'Listo para familia', mea? Oh, um, that means she wants a guy who's ready to have a family. Yep, we should go right now. Wait a minute. I mean, I haven't thought about it before. It hasn't been a viable option for anyone, but yeah, sure, I-I think I'd like to have a family someday. You want a Mexican family? Woah, woah, woah, why do you say it like that? A Mexican family? I didn't mean it like that, but do you want to get mixed up in all these immigration issues? I mean, things are only gonna get harder for these people. What do mean by 'these people'? I am these people. Last I checked, these people are your lawyer. I didn't it mean like... All right, all right, guys, we're getting ahead of ourselves. No one's marrying anyone. So, get to it then. Kiki and I will go pick up the car and meet you back here afterwards, yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, hey, Karina! Hey, good morning, guys. - Morning. - Hi, good morning. Where you off to, looking all cute with your backpack? I'm going to study. I have to prepare for the culinary competition - in two days. - Oh. So your homework is to make delicious food? - Yup. - How would you like this dog to eat your homework? So, we're actually leaving today, and I was wondering... maybe you can give me your phone number, - grab a drink... - Mommy! Hi my love! Say hi to these boys. Hi. Hi. Karina, how do I say, 'You're the most interesting woman I've ever met' in Spanish? Tú eres la mujer más interesante que he conocido. What about um, what about 'your eyes are beautiful'? Tell them, baby. Tus ojos son muy bonitos. Who do you want to say that to? He has a date with Angelica later. And he doesn't speak Spanish? Any other tips I should know? How about learning some Spanish? Nice. Well, if you're here just for fun, she's gonna smell that a mile away and crush your balls. Crush balls. Got it. Glad I could help. Is your car ready? Yes. Thank you so much for everything. My pleasure. It was very nice meeting you guys. Will we be seeing you here again soon? Me? Oh, ah, it ah, um, yeah, I-I guess so. Yeah. Yeah, probably, yeah. Yeah. Okay then. See you then. Nice to meet you. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Oh, well, too bad. I'm just not ready to be a father yet. Welcome to Filippi Winery. Follow me please. Ready? Estos tanques son hechos de secuoya roja. These tanks are made out of 2,000-year-old redwood. Ah, the temperature in the... in these tanks is controlled, but when the wine is ready... Me encata el olor de los barriles. (I love the smell of wine barrels.) These barrels that you see here are special. And the owner only lets important people to carve into the wood. If you look at the barrel over here, you can see some signatures. That's because the owner of the winery lets special people carve their initials... We are special people. Won't we get in trouble? This is incredible. Que atrevido. (You're so daring!) You're so beautiful. And I'm so near you. I almost can't believe it. I think I'm over my phobia. Where'd everyone go? Ah, where's True? I'm going to wring his neck. Wait, maybe he's closing the deal. You really don't know True, do you? Still no reception. El siguente grupo debe llegar en cualquier momento. (Don't worry. The next group will be here at any moment.) I hate enclosed spaces. Estas bien? (Are you ok?) We have to get out of the cellar. Oh, yeah. I don't know what you're saying, but calm down they're coming. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Whoo! Hey, I don't know what you're thinking, But I'm not that kind of woman! What's wrong with you? What are you doing? Pull your pants up! I'm suffocating down here! I-I can't breathe! Ah-ha-ha! I am sorry. Disculpame. Disculpame. Disculpame, disculpame, disculpame, disculpame. Here. Thanks for not arresting him. He's a little sick in the head. Thank you miss. Tell your boyfriend that we have great psychologists in Tijuana. Of course I will. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. Are you alright? I'm loco. That's what I told the security guard Me diverti mucho. I enjoyed myself. Really? Shall we go to Encuentro? You're loco for kissing me after that. Yeah, she paid the guard with a bottle of wine and batting her eyelashes; otherwise, I'd be in a Mexican jail right now. That girl thought you were perving out and it all ended with a kiss? Oh. Your algorithm was right all along. And now that you got it out of your system, we could go. I still think "Compatible" shouldn't be matching people who don't speak the same language. I mean, how cool would it be if we stayed a few more days, huh? Not cool at all. Maximillion's people sent some logistics to go over before they draw up the contract. Hey, Karina! Hey. Hey, True. So, how'd it go? Great. I mean, horrible, but great. Listen, I'm gonna ask you a strange question. I'm listening. Can you teach me Spanish? What did I tell you? That I should learn Spanish. A-and I'm willing to pay. I-I'm a good student. I'm a line cook. I'm a student and I'm a mother. I'm not a Spanish teacher. Please. I know you can do it. I'm sorry, I can't help you. Karina, please? I-I'm a quick learner. I can, I'll-I'll come during the day. I'll just observe and learn. Aren't you leaving tonight? Um, no. I want to stay a few more days. You can't learn Spanish in a few days. I can learn a few key phrases. Just enough to... look, please? Please? Tell him $300 dollars a day. Good idea! A high price so he says no. Don't... please don't say no. I-I heard you say no. See, I'm already learning Spanish from you. My manager says $300 a day. Done! Yes, deal. Wait, what? No! I'm sorry. A deal's a deal. We already fived on it. - When do we start? - God, okay, fine. Meet me inside in ten minutes. Awesome. I'll be the best student you ever had. Don't worry, it's easy. I've been speaking two languages my whole life. Why the hell are you so happy? Okay, don't be mad, but I'm going to stay a few more days. What? Why? I hired a tutor. I'm going to learn Spanish. - Wow. - True, we came. We saw. You didn't conquer. We're gone. I can do this, Benny. Then I'll be a hundred percent certain I feel comfortable not telling Maximillion - about the glitch. - There is no glitch. If you tell him that, you will sabotage this deal. You know what? Fine, stay. You do this every time. Do what? You leave me to take it to the finish line. What are you talking about? If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have an app. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have a $10 million deal. I'm getting real tired of picking up your slack. What's that supposed to mean? - Huh? - Guys, guys, guys, stop. Stop. Benny, I will stay here with him, okay? We'll work from here. Whatever. You're going to do what you want anyway. That went well. Hmm. Come on. If she doesn't say yes, the lesson's pointless. Sent. You think she'll say yes? I'm five years old. I have no idea. True, come antes de que empezemos. Are you talking to me? Your lesson started. Comer means eat. Have something before we start. She said no. - You're kidding. - Yes, I am. She said to meet her here at eight o'clock. Ah-ha! You have a mean streak but it doesn't matter because I have a date tonight. - Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! - If you have a date tonight, we better start the lesson. Oh, okay. A-E-I-O-U. Let's begin with the vowels. A. No. Don't open your mouth so wide. Smaller, like you're saying... Aw! Oh-o-oh! There's that mean streak again. Oh, that deserves a tickle. Tickle. Get out of here, you. Ah-ah-ah-ah! Ah-ah! Oh man, she's too cute. Did you really strip down to your chonies at the winery? You heard about that too? The whole town heard about it. I'm really claustrophobic. I-I don't know, I just-sometime... ah. Tacos is not a first-date food for you, is it? You're a mess. Look, um, you're on the right track. If a man traveled across the border and paid way too much to learn Spanish... I'd hit that. You're one classy dame. How do you say dog in Spanish? Perro. Kiki is a hair. Oh boy, we have some work to do. Okay. Let's start with some phrases. - Hola. - Hola. - Me llamo... - Me llamo... - True. - True. - Bien. - Bien. - Good job. - Good job. Oh-ah... "Muy bien" means good job. Hmm, okay. Okay. The chocolate? - No. It's high five. - Oh. Oh. Angelica, you're beautiful. Oh, hey, good evening, Regina. - Oh, good evening. - Hmm. - Have you got a minute? - Oh, yeah. - Sit down, please. - Sure. Enrique is not your average lawyer, is he? That's the understatement of the year. No, ma'am. And um, I hear you really like Valle despite the near-death experience you had at the winery? You heard about that too? Well, everyone did. Well, I-I-I promise not to take my clothes off for the rest of the trip. Oh, that's good. - Oh. - You know, when I was 25 years old, my parents wanted me to marry someone they had chosen. He came from money, education, but I didn't love him. They tried to force a connection that simply wasn't there. You don't think Angelica and I have a connection? No, um... I think my niece is not an experiment to test out the validity of your app. No, I agree. Hmm-mm. Hmm. I-I-I'm not a bad guy. I know you're not, True. But time is something that young people take for granted. And I need her to focus on bigger matters. Do you understand? And... I'm sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Karina... Hey, True. I can't do it. Do what? I'm supposed to meet with Angelica in just a few minutes and-and it's happening again. Like I-I'm supposed to meet with her but like... there is like Regina and then like I-I don't , and I-I can't even speak English. How am I supposed to speak Spanish? So what? She knows that already. No. It's-it's way worse! Like when I... when I get nervous, I completely lose it. You have to help me. How? You have to listen in and tell me what to say. No, I'm working. How did you communicate with her before? Over a translation app. Great. Use that. No, it's... it's too awkward. I need to make a good impression. Please? Please, please, please, please... Okay. Okay, okay, okay, - I'll help you. - Ah, thank you. But I won't translate anything kinky, okay? - Keep it clean. - Got it. Nothing kinky, clean. Just clean. Okay. Ah, ah, can I see your phone please? Please, please, thank you. Okay. We're connected. Testes, testes, ah, uno, dos, um... can you give me one test to go, please? What are you, like 12? Perfect. Got it. Thank you. Hola. Say "Te ves muy hermosa". Angelica, you're beautiful. Thank you. And you look very handsome. She just said you look handsome. Great. I mean, gracias. Um, hmm? Hmm? Thank you. What a gentleman. Oye, que bien estas hablando el Español. She just said you're speaking Spanish well. Say práctique. I practiced. Ah, everything okay? Yeah, everything's ok. An ex-boyfriend? Nice. Hmm, sí. Su nombre es Daniel. Daniel, that's his name. Why you and him no more? Um, okay. Es immaduro y cuando le da selos, se porta como un bobo. When he gets jealous, he acts like an idiot. - Me manda texts hablandome... - He sends her a nice text. - ...bonito, pero no cambia. - And then he doesn't change. Sounds like I got like a shot. Sure does. Shall we take a selfie, True? Oh, y-yeah. Yeah. What a beautiful photo. It's-it's a good-looking couple. Ah, yeah. It's good. Tu si les cairías muy bien a mis papás. She said her parents would really like you. Yeah. Ah-ah... Hey! Ah, oh, ah, please, oh, yeah, yeah. Hmm. A toast. To old loves and new friends. Gracias. A toast. To son loves and egg friends. Oh, ah, ah,? No. Daniel? - Yes. He got upset over the selfie of us that I sent him. - Hmm. Oh no, she just sent Daniel the selfie. Do you have the pig feet? You have pig feet. Give me the tongue. Give me the tongue. Gross. Oh, no! You just asked her to give you her tongue. Hey, what's that? What's in your ear? Who are you talking to? She's onto us. She wants to know what's in your ear. What do we do? I-I... What's wrong with you, True? Ah, Um... hmm-mm. Eh-huh, hey. Hmm? Hmm-mm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm-mm. Hmm... Is this yours? Ah, oh no. Ah, it's not mine. I, ah, but I'll take it to lost and found for you. No problem. Karina? The number you dialed is no longer in service. A Daniel le encanta los juegos. Daniel liked games. Ya basta con niños que les gusta perder mi tiempo. Necesito un hombre verdad. Enough with children with their games. I need a real man. Hey, Benny. Hey, Max has some pretty exciting news. I'm going to patch him right through. - Wait, no I don't... - Konichiwa, boys, I'm in Toko with my business partner. And guess what? He loves, absolutely loves the app. So, he adores Dalmatians. And what happened is that it matched him with a very attractive firefighter. I'd say three months, we want to release "Compatible" throughout Asia. Maximillion, that's fantastic. Right, it is. But for me, what's really fantastic is my dream came true. Betty Boop bought me this kimono. I didn't even... even ask for it. Somehow, she knew I love kimonos. I haven't worn a kimono in like 15 years. So look at you boys, I mean, you're cyber Cupids. I mean, that is so neat. Betty and... ah, Betty. Don't... - Mr. Woods, um... okay. Yeah. - Betty, not now. - I'm... - Go ahead. Take all the time you need. I'm talking to my future partners, Betty. It's um... um... It's, ah, Mr. Woods, as I was saying, um, there are a lot of different languages in Asia and based on my recent experience, I think it's important that there be a language quotient - on the next variable. - Oh no, I... bad action. What the hell, True? I didn't prove the app works, Benny. I only proved it doesn't work. Just get your ass back here and let's finish this deal. One more day? Where's Kiki? I'll make him bring you back. I need one more day. Dammit, True. You know what? Fine. The biggest moment of your life, and you're going to leave me alone. You're being dramatic. You want dramatic? How's this? Ah-ah. Sí, ¿quien es? True. I need your help, please. At nine at night? I know, but I keep playing tonight over in my head. All right, come in. But you have to be quiet because Amalia and my mom are asleep. Got it. Looks like someone's hungry. Oh, I'm working on some appetizers for the scholarship cook-off. You know what? You'll be my sous chef while you sulk. Don't ask. It's my mother's weight loss plan. Don't I look hot? In fact... Oh, that's a lovely question. If I win the Miss Valle de Guadalupe pageant, I'll find homes for all the street dogs. I'll erect street signs so no one gets lost. And I'll solve world hunger with Karina's amazing cooking. - Shh. - Oh, oops. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Knock it off. - Sorry. And start beating those eggs. Okay. Bad eggs. Bad eggs. Bad eggs. Bad eggs. - True! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh um, if you go a little faster like this, it'll make them a little fluffier. Got it. Ah, wait, why did you come here? I screwed up. She's impetuous like that. She likes daring type of guys. Daring? She wants to see the world. Bungee jump off bridges, that kind of crap. Around here? That's how she met you. Regina had no idea that she was gone partying in San Diego. Could you rinse these? - Hey, True? - Yeah? Of all the apps you could have created... ...why a dating app? Well, after my father left my mother, she always said there was the perfect match for her out there somewhere. Just never seemed to find it. Your poor mom. I figured I-I wouldn't leave it to chance, so I decided I'd create the perfect mathematical formula for love. You think math can help you find love? Of course. I mean, if you weigh in value, mutual likes and dislikes, add proximity detectors and process it all using the latest targeted advertising algorithms, you get "Compatible". Boop. How unromantic. Boop. What are you doing? I'm creating your profile. Humor me. Karina? - Salas. - Salas. That's... that's right. Now a quote. "The flavor of life is made with love, sweat and tears." Ah, so silly. I'm an aspiring chef. My friends would say I'm loving, patient, funny. I'm a great Spanish tutor... and I love my family. Looking for someone ready to adore me. - Oh! - I'm an idiot. - Shoot. - Ah. Ah. Ah. I-I shouldn't be doing this. I'm-I'm sorry. I-I... Look, True, I um, I'm married. What? He's not here. He left to the States to help us out financially. It was supposed to be a year. It's been three. - Ah! - You should go. - Ah! - You have to go. You should... Yeah. Yeah. Ah! Thanks for meeting me and not ignoring my text. Um... Like this? Where's the library? I understand everything you say. - ¿Que es? - What is this? It's called a pilot. Kiki got it from this girl named Aureli. Look, um, I'm sorry I pretended like I knew Spanish and for taking my clothes off, and for pretty much everything. This is me. I-I like plain beef tacos and-and gluten free beer. I'm not an adventurous guy, and-and I'm not really a wine guy either. I'm pretty simple, but I do know I like you, and it... the app matched us for a reason. And-and if you just have some tacos with me and-and a beer, ah, I think you'll find that I'm a pretty cool guy. You know what? Daniel always does what Daniel wants. And here you are doing this for me. It's like my mom says... ...one nail removes another. Yeah. I have no idea what that means. That's what I love about you. You make me laugh. This can't be. Ah. Ah. Angelica, who's he? - Daniel. - Daniel. Daniel? Dos meses sin ver tus lindos ojos... Two months without your beautiful eyes. ...y mi alma revive con una sola mirada. And my soul revives with just one glance. Ah, hmm-mm. Daniel,. Daniel, what are you doing here? I couldn't stand a second more. I traveled three days. I had to see you. Ah, hola. So I'm, so I'm so sorry... so I'm... s... Soy True. I'm True so... Daniel. Daniel, remember the friend I told you about, True? Hey. - No. Daniel. - No. Daniel. Don't hit him. I'm not going to hit you. I'm not going to hit him. I'm changing my way. Hmm-mm. All of a sudden. Nice to meet you, True. Any friend of Angelica is a friend of mine. It's a pleasure to meet you too. It's a pretty kick-ass bike you got there. Thanks, I restored it myself. - It's awesome. - You know how to ride? Huh? Sure, yeah. Totally. - All right. - You never forget. You're so annoying. Hey. Is it... is it... is it on? Is it... You got to pump it? You got to turn on the key first. Oh. Ah, got it. Cool. I knew that, by the way. I knew that... I knew you... where that was... ready? - Here I go. - Rev it up. I don't know, man. All right, here we go. One, two, three. Woah, woah, woah, woah, wah! Oh my... True! True! - True! - I'm so sorry. Are you ok? Calm down, Daniel! No, no, I'll fix everything. Tranquilo. My love look, I want to punch him in the face, but nothing! I will fix everything. I am so sorry. - No, no, no. - I know you restored it... but I will... I will-you-the... this is... Don't worry about it. I'll take care of... Kiki, we're leaving back to San Diego. We're heading back in 15 minutes. Why are you leaving? Hey. Staying was a mistake. I just can't stop thinking about the way she looked at him. I can't get it out of my mind. At who? Daniel. He's here? He rode in on his motorcycle, looking all Sons of Anarchy with his muscles and his hair and she just completely melted. Man, I just... I don't know what it is, but that guy has such a hold on her. I made a fool of myself. I just... I fell apart. Apparently, I get flustered in front of beautiful men too. Don't worry about him. Daniel es un bruto; you're funny. You listen to women, and you're willing to take a chance on love. Benny was right. I came, I saw, I didn't conquer. It's time to go home. No, you can't leave now. You owe it to yourself to fight. How was it going before Daniel showed up? She wanted to give me a chance, but I blew it when I crashed his motorcycle. You crashed his motorcycle? Yeah. That's awesome. That is not awesome! He was so mad. True, listen. About last night... I just... Oh, so hot in Valle! Aurelie is so gorgeous. All she wants is the Kiki. We're heading back to San Diego. If you can be ready in an hour, I'm telling Sabi to take us to the border. What? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, Aurelie invited us to a party tonight. Bro, I've been here for you for the last three days. The least you could do is be here for me. Kiki, it's time... No, no! Tonight we dance and you... get a babysitter. You're coming with us. Oh, I should probably rest for the cook off... No, pshhh. No, more Mr. Nice Kiki. Only Mr. Dancing Kiki. - Ugh. - Wow. Are you feeling better? Angelica who? You know any of these people? Many of them. It's a small community. Everyone knows everyone. They all know about you. What? What do they know? They have bets going on whether Angelica's going to fall for you or not. No, they do not. Yeah. They don't know about Daniel. I could make a lot of money with that useful info. Hey, I'm hurting here. Stop. So I um, have news... Carlos was deported. My husband. What? No way. Yeah, he's being held at the border, and we're not sure when he'll be released. Wow. He started a new family. What? He has a little boy named Carlitos. Son of a useless mother. You are scary when you speak Spanish. You know what? Forget Angelica, forget Carlos. No more talking. Tonight, we dance. Okay. Hey True, Karina! Hey, Kiki! Hey! You made it! Hey! Cheers, man. - Oh my gosh. - Hey, look who's here. My friend was a . Yes. - Oh no. - I know. Ah. Oh. Isn't this beautiful? It's so peaceful out here. My app is stupid. No, it's not. But don't you think, in the end, it's people's true nature what really makes the relationship either stick or not? I hope not, because my true nature is to be a huge dork. You know what pisses me off? What? It's been over for about a year. I haven't been in love with Carlos, but I hung in there because we made vows. Right. And because we have Amalia. Right. I mean, you're not the only one that's been waiting for him. - So is she. - Exactly. He doesn't think that I've had feelings for others? Exactly. I have needs too. - Of course, you do. - I'm such a fool. Here I am being faithful... Idiot. I mean him, not you. ...fighting my feelings for you. Exactly... wait, what? What? What? I'm such a bad friend... But I can't help what I'm feeling. Karina... Welcome to our annual culinary cook-off contest. Encuentro Regina Scholarship was started five years ago. Our goal is to develop the talents of our local aspiring chefs and send them to study with the masters of the world. Judges, please take your seats at the table. Ladies and gentlemen, our chefs: Karina, Carmela, and Ricardo. Karina! Our chefs have prepared a three-course meal for our judges, and they will now present the appetizers. And now, it's time for the main course. - Oh, excuse me. - Watch it, man. Excuse me. S-sorry. Bueno. We will give the judges 30 minutes to make their selection. In the meantime, continue to enjoy our wine and delicacies of our region. There you are. Did you get this text from Benny? Yeah, that's why I've been trying to get a hold of you. - What's going on? - I-I don't know. Benny's gone off the rails. True. - Oh, ah... I need a second. - What? - Can you give me one second? - No, no, no. I just... just one second, please? Thank you. Ah, whatever. I'm going to call him. Thanks. Um... - Hola. - Hola. Um... Hmm-mm. I have something to tell you. I also have something to tell you. I understand how you feel for Daniel. Daniel wants me to go back with him - to Mexico City. - I get it. I-I get it. No. No, I don't want to. Ah... ah, Karina, it's-it's not what you think. Karina, Ah! Ah. Karina, please. Carlos please, I can't do this. Karina, I'm talking to you! You know what? Your app doesn't work. My friends created my profile. You and I have nothing in common, you idiot. Karina, please. No, Carlos. You're shameless. How dare you show up here? - Is everything okay? - Let go of me, Carlos! - Who's this idiot? - A friend. This is my husband. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention... Please. Everyone... Oh! Oh! Ow. ...the judges have made their decision. And it is unanimous. - Jesus, True. - Whoa... - You okay? - Uh-uh. Hey, get up. Ah. Hey, we got to get back to San Diego now. I just got a PDF from Benny's lawyer. You're Benny's lawyer. Not anymore. He screwed us, man. He screwed us hard. Okay? Now, he's going forward with "Compatible" without you. Come on, we got to go. The winner of this year's culinary cook-off contest scholarship is Karina Salas. Karina! Benny, how could you do this? We've been best friends since the seventh grade. Don't talk to my partner. Your partner? Benny's my partner. He was your partner. I spent my whole career making snap judgements on people's characters. And 99.999% of the time, I'm right. The first time I met you, I didn't like you. You had some good ideas, but you're not a winner. You're like a whiny little wiener. It's not true. You don't even know what the truth is. You spend your whole time chasing dreams instead of grabbing onto reality. For once in your life, do the right thing! Here is an offer from Mr. Vaswani and Mr. Woods. I think you'll find it quite fair. We're going to proceed with the three F's. Fun, fast, and fair for all. I got another F-word for you, buddy. I trusted you. "Compatible" was my idea, Benny. True, you can trust me, but I can't trust you. What? I would never do something like this to you. Oh, but you did. This last week, you abandoned our company for a chick? But it's not just about this last week, man. From the beginning, you've been insecure, unable to pull the trigger on anything, and yes, it was your idea, but without me, "Compatible" would simply be that... an idea. I've made this into a reality. What we are offering is more than fair, True. Don't say my name. T-t-t-r-r-r-oo-oo-oo. Don't say my name. - True. - No. - Ta-rue. - Don't... - True! - Don't say my name! Ta-ha-hoa-ruea. - Don't! - A-True! - Don't! - True! Bless you! Don't! Don't! Choo, choo, choo, choo, True! A choo-choo train? Don't! True. - Shut up! - True! Okay, gentlemen, let's just settle down, huh? Ah, Mr. Andrews and I will look over your offer and get back to you with our decision. I know my decision. No! My answer is 'No' now. It's 'No' tomorrow. It'll be 'No' forever! That's okay. Thank you very much. Let's go, True. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. - No! - Thank you. - No! - Let's go. Come on, just watch your step. Let's go. Come on. You can suck my app! Can you believe that guy? I actually can't. Oh, oh, okay. This is extreme. I'm not signing those papers, Kiki. Son of... he pulled a Zuckerberg on us. But-but-but Benny did give you two options. A, they could buy you out, or B, you could be a silent partner with no voting rights. I don't care if they offer me three times that amount. I'm not selling or giving up what's mine. How can he do this to me? Hey, hey, hey. You don't have to accept his terms. All right? Ah, you definitely won't get the deal from Maximillion, but we can find another investor. Without me, "Compatible" will die. Hello? Hola, Sabi. Oh, no. Thank you for letting me know. Adios. Everything okay? No. Regina died. It was a beautiful funeral. I bet the whole town was here. I should've told her that I loved her. She knew. I mean, we all did. What am I going to do without her? She was my best friend. First Benny, now Regina. Benny died? Oh, no, no. I-I... he-he screwed me. He doesn't want to be my business partner. I spent so many years talking about business with Regina, I was never able to tell her what I felt. Don't make the same mistake I did. You want me to tell Benny I love him? The more I teach you, the dumber I get. So, what happens with Encuentro Regina now? We're about to find out. Kiki, what are you doing? Thank you all for coming. My name is Enrique Calderon, and for those of you who don't know me, I'm an attorney. Two weeks ago, Regina asked me to make some changes to her last will and testament. Now these documents are drafted in English and I've asked Sabi to translate to Spanish for those of us who are in need of it. I, Regina Aragon, being of sound mind and body, leave the following as my final will and testament. Encuentro Regina has been more than a business. It was created out of love. We shared this love with visitors from all around the world. I tried to prepare somebody to take over when I would no longer be here, but found not one person qualified to run the business. Qué! I am not leaving Encuentro to any one of you. Wow. I am leaving it to ALL of you to own, manage, and grow together. The vineyard, hotel, restaurant, and all properties and assets will be owned in common by all employees. Wow. To my niece, Angelica Beltran, I leave 20% of the business as long as she stays to work and manage it for a period of not less than five years. To Sabio Segovia, I leave 10% of the business in honor of his years of loyal and dedicated service. The remainder of the business is to be shared equally among all salaried employees, currently under staff, with Encuentro Regina. With all of my love and gratitude, Regina Aragon. Hey. That was a surprise! Yeah. Um, sorry I couldn't tell you sooner. Ah, Regina wanted to keep it a secret until after she passed. You mean, she knew she was dying? Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah. Pobrecita. She didn't know if it was three days or three months, but she knew it was terminal. So, you two never...? Ah, no. Hell no. I let your twisted little brain jump to its own conclusion. You're a sly dog, Kiki. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm glad things all worked out in the end. Well, I hope so. I mean, they have their work cut out for them. What do you mean? The winery is heavily in debt. Regina had a major US-based distributor pull out after the political situation changed. I mean, it's not going to be easy for them to keep this place, you know? I'm sure they'll pull it off. Excuse me, buddy. I got to talk to someone. Yeah, absolutely. Go ahead. Sabi, can I have a moment? Sí. Um, do you know where Karina went? She left in a hurry. I messed up. As long as there is breath left in you... and breath in her, there's still a chance. Why don't you stay, fix things with her? A wise man once told me... when love is ready, I'd know. Can I talk to her for a moment? Yeah, sure. Hmm. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Ah! You didn't waste my time. I just wanted a beautiful and smart girl to love. That would love me back. True... True, you do have a beautiful woman who loves you. Go to her. I have to do something first. Hmm. I'd know that cheap watch anywhere. 3:30 on the dot. It's been said before that you can set a clock by your bowel movement. It's over, True. Just sign the papers and let me take my dump in peace. This isn't the time or place for this. Oh, I think this is the perfect place for a piece of crap like you. So it's like that now? See, I just had a little chat with Betty. The cleaning lady? And I just slipped her a hundred dollars to take every bit of paper out of this bathroom. Good luck wiping with the air blower. That's not funny, True. True? True! Come back here. Spare a square! I'm cutting you off financially. I don't care, Mom. I... oh, I'll call you back. Hi, hi, hi... Hi Betty. Hi, Maxi. - Hmm. - Hmm. Hmm. You're so hot. Oh. Yeah. - Oh. Ah. - Ah-ah. Sometimes you do things that seem wrong... ...because it's the right thing to do. Betty, don't leave this here. You know I'm a germaphobe. What the hell are you doing here? Hey, hey, don't... don't be mad at Betty, okay? Don't be mad at... and hey, I got... I got hand sanitizer, all right? No big deal. Look, I'm here for a second chance. I've been in Valle de Guadalupe with a truly incredible woman and I blew it. Shocker! That's your plea for a second chance? "Compatible" matched me with her. But a machine isn't enough. Love doesn't work that way. But if it wasn't for "Compatible", I never would have went down to Mexico. I never would have made a fool of myself and I never would have met the most incredible, hardworking woman in the world. Are you here to brag, son? No. "Compatible" said your favorite's Tempranillo. And that's a copy of all the emails Benny sent backstabbing me. If he can turn on someone he's known since the seventh grade, what's he going to do with someone he just met? What is this? I signed. I'm taking your deal. Ah! I guess you're... not the wiener I thought you were. Good luck. Last year, we had a heat wave that dried the grapes, but this year, it's been plentiful. It's the most beautiful place in Valle de Guadalupe. - True, how are you? - Good. Mr. Mendez, this is True Andrews, he's a friend of the family. True, this is Mr. Marco Mendez. He's um... he's buying Encuentro Regina. We'll simply call it Encuentro, of course. We're not changing the name. True, what are you talking about? Mr. Mendez is buying the vineyard. He can call it what he wants. Sorry. Can I have a moment? Excuse us. What is this? You said you needed an investor. True, I can't accept this. You worked so hard on your app. I'll create a new app, or I won't. Besides, it's done. Ah. Ah, I get it. You don't want to be my partner either. I may be old, but I'm not a pendejo. I'm sorry, Mr. Mendez, but the vineyard is already sold. I'll explain it over a bottle of wine. Ah, Sabi, I need to talk to Karina. Ah, mijo, she won the contest. She's leaving for Spain today. She's catching a bus to the airport from Ensenada. Sorry, big guy. Um, do you prefer red or white? ¿Todo bien? Tengo un flat tiro. Don't ever tell anyone I was your Spanish tutor. I see you've been working out. Hmm. I figured if I wore this, you couldn't stay mad at me. You're right. But I haven't been mad at you. I just, I-I was at first, but I talked to Angelica. We're good. Okay, great. And ah, what about Carlos? He's out of the picture. We're no longer married. So fast? Have you heard of a Mexican divorce? You guys have drive-thru weddings, we have drive-thru divorces. I can't say I'm sorry to hear that. What does True want? He wants me to forgive him and be his girlfriend. Should I? No. Come on. Are you serious? You have to be kidding. Yes, I am. I am kidding. I have to go. I'll wait for you. Check the app.
