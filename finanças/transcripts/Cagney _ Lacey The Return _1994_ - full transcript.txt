(Multicom Jingle) (soft dramatic music) (whistling) (engine idling) (whistling) (dramatic music) (whistling) - Keep whistling. Don't fight, and you won't get hurt. We want your boat. - Why would anybody wanna hijack a tugboat? - Carmen. Carmen? Oh. - Good evening. - Hello. Carmen? Oh, Carmen, will you put these on for me? - Of course, Mrs. Burton. - And would you check the ice? I don't think we're gonna have enough. Everything else looks lovely, Carmen. The flowers are beautiful, thank you. Well, Carmen. Jimmy, come on, stop it, you're making me crazy. - That's the idea. - You've gotta get dressed. - Not if we hop a plane to Bora Bora. I could make you crazy on the beach. - I'd love to, but not tonight. - Tropical breezes, moonlight. You show me your sarong, I'll show you mine. - Jimmy, would you come on and get dressed? They're gonna be here soon. - Okay. - [Christine] Don't be nervous. - Well how'd you like to face a party full of my old friends stone-cold sober? - I did, your Harvard reunion. - That's different. - Why, because my friends are blue collar? My father was right, see, you scratch a liberal, underneath is a monarchist. - They're all cops, Christine. The only cops I knew before ran me in for a DUI. - Would you relax? I'll make them check their nightsticks at the door. Now would you get dressed? (grunting) - Mary Beth, the babysitter's here. - I'm surprised she bothered inviting us. - What are you talking about? It's Lieutenant Samuels' retirement. Of course Chris would invite us. - Since the wedding, you know how many times I've seen her? - I don't know, what, a half a dozen? - Four times, exactly. And only when she wanted something from me. - Come on, Mary Beth, it's only natural you two wouldn't get together so much anymore. I mean, you're not on the force, and she's married to this rich guy. Come on, let's go, hon, we're gonna miss the hors doeuvres. (guests chattering) - They finally put a woman in charge of the squad at the one-four, congratulations. - Thank you, but what about Cagney? Executive officer of the district attorney's police squad, honey, in line for a captaincy. - And always so dignified. - Always. (laughing) - It's a glorified desk job but it gives me more time with my first husband. Excuse me. Hi, Corassa. See, this isn't so terrible. - Well, in the bad old days with a couple of scotches under my belt, I'd be having a hell of a time. - I hear you. - How are you doing? - I'm okay, I'm just worried about Mary Beth. - Well they're probably having trouble finding parking. - No, she's never late. (traffic passing) - Now, honey? - A few minutes more. - We're late already, Mary Beth. - Well it's better than looking too anxious. Do I have too much lipstick? (traffic passing) - Better. Let's go? - Yeah. (traffic passing) - [Man] Taxi, taxi. (passersby chattering) - Honey, quit pulling on your collar. - It's strangling me. - Yeah. This whole neighborhood makes you feel like your clothes don't fit right. (doorbell ringing) - Excuse me. (soft music) Hi, Mary Beth. - Christine, I hope we're not late. - Mrs. Burton, may I speak to you for a moment please? - Um, yeah, just a minute. - This is private stock. Oh, Harvey's spaghetti sauce. Everybody's here, come on in. - She remembers. (guests chattering) - Hi. - Hey. - So tell me what it's like, retirement. - Great, I get to see my little girl grow up. - Are you still living in the house in Queens? - No, you know, it's only the three of us now. With the boys gone, we really didn't need all that room. Where's Marcus? - He'll be here soon, he's in charge of loading weapons on some barge for disposal. - They're all junk, it's a publicity scam. - No, there's a lotta confiscated guns, too, from robberies and stuff. The thing is they're gonna tow them out in the ocean, they're gonna dump them all tomorrow. - I thought they melted them down, some place in Jersey, I thought. - No, the transportation strike, I heard they had to get approval of the EPA, the whole schmear. - Marcus said they're doing some big publicity thing tomorrow, television, newspapers, the whole works. - They're probably looking to make a big splash. - Victor. - Come on. - What I say? (laughing) (soft dramatic music) - Okay, Sergeant, there you are. 4,200 weapons. They're all yours till six AM tomorrow. - Yes, sir, Lieutenant. - Press'll probably be here at the crack of dawn, so try to keep everybody awake. - No worries, sir, they're good men. - Okay, I'll probably check in with you later tonight. - Don't you worry, sir, and give my regards to Bert Samuels. I remember him from, oh, 15, 16 years ago when he was still a sergeant in the 79th. - All right, I'll tell him. Goodnight, Sergeant Nelson. (soft dramatic music) - I heard he was friends with the president, then he turned down the ambassadorship to Ireland. - He went to law school with him, Cagney said, and it was Iceland, not Ireland. - Iceland? - Yeah. - The ambassador to Iceland? I guess he isn't such a good friend. - Excuse me please. Sorry, pardon me. - Chris. - Harvey, one second, I have to get something. Be right back. - Hi, thanks for the sauce, that's all we get. - Mary Beth, she's hosting a party. She's spreading herself around, give her a break. - What's the matter? - I don't know, I pulled something this morning. - Want me to rub that for you later? (chuckling) - All right, everybody! Can I have everyone's attention please? May I have your-- (doorbell ringing) Jim, get that, will you? Can I have your attention please? Everybody over to the staircase. And, Lieutenant, would you join me please? - James Burton. - Marcus Petrie. - We got a telegram this morning, from his retirement villa in Calabria. No looking. Forgive my accent. (speaking foreign language) Which means welcome to paradise. (laughing) Peasants. (laughing) All the best, Paolo Laguardia! (cheering) (applauding) ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ Which nobody can deny ♪ ♪ Which nobody can deny ♪ - Would you excuse me while I get some water? - Nice party. - Good, yeah, I think so. - How you doing? - Good, thanks. You look great. - You look better. - Oh. - Married life must agree with you. - Yeah, it's nice. (wheezing) - Mary Beth. (soft dramatic music) - Oh God, Harvey. (soft dramatic music) - Harvey. - Harvey. - Harvey, are you all right? - Oh my God. - Jim, call 911. Harvey? (wheezing) Harvey? - Harv? (crowd murmuring) - [Christine] He's not breathing. - Harvey? (soft dramatic music) (blowing) Oh my God. - [Christine] Come on, Harvey. - Oh my God. - [Christine] I'll breathe for you. - Oh my God. (soft dramatic music) Harv. Harvey, oh my God. Oh my God. (sobbing) (soft dramatic music) (siren blaring) - Excuse me, I need to get in there, okay. If I'm gonna help you, okay, just. (siren blaring) (dramatic music) (engine idling) (dramatic music) - Hey, Sarge? - Give me the loud hammer. (dramatic music) Ahoy there, this is a restricted area. You have to turn back. - [Korbutt] We have an emergency here. - I said turn back. - [Korbutt] I've got a snapped steering cable. We don't have complete control here. - Radio for the Coast Guard, Sarge? - No, we better play it safe. Ring Hackett at the gate, get everybody else over on this side of the barge. - Guys. (dramatic music) - Reverse your engines, Captain. I can't let you come any closer. Something wrong with your ears, I said turn back. - We're doing the best we can, but we need help. (struggling) - [Matt] Reverse your engines, Captain. I can't let you come any closer. - [Korbutt] Before you decide that, I might suggest you look behind you. (guns cocking) (dramatic music) - He's real strong, Mary Beth, he's gonna be okay. - Dr. Binks, Dr. Jerry Binks, to the MRI Suite Five, Southeast. - How is he? - Well he's stabilized. I think he's gonna be all right. - Oh God. Oh thank you, God. Oh thank you, Doctor. God bless you, Doctor. - It was a close call, but it's a good thing that somebody knew CPR. (crying) - I'll go tell the guys. - Yeah. (staff murmuring) (sobbing) (staff murmuring) (soft dramatic music) (feet stepping) (soft dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Hurry it up, we got five minutes. (dramatic music) Which one of you is in charge here? - I, I, I. - I said which one? (muffled speaking) (dramatic music) (groaning) You? - You're crazy, you won't get away with this. - You are coming with me. (dramatic music) - It's gonna be okay. They'll take the guns, then they'll go and it'll be okay. (soft dramatic music) (gun firing) Oh my God. Oh my God, I'm sorry if I haven't been good. - God, I was scared. He didn't look like he was gonna come back. And all I could think about was Mary Beth if I let him die. Would she be pissed. - You know, you were really pretty impressive tonight? - Yeah? - Yeah. - I mean, I never saw anybody do that before. - Mm. Last time I did CPR was on my dad. Only I couldn't save him. It's okay, it was a long time ago. You smell good. - Hmm, actually, I think it's the lobster ravioli. You ready for some solid food? - Uh-huh. We have tons of this stuff left over. Nobody had a chance to eat anything. Maybe I should have the gang over again. You'd love that, wouldn't you? - I could live with it. - It was great seeing everybody. Those were really good times for me, Jimmy. (drink pouring) - And now you have a desk job and me. Does that make you unhappy? - No, I'm happy. - Your nose is getting longer. - I am, I've never been happier. - Good. - [PA] Dr. Ellen James, Dr. Ellen James, please report-- - You sure look a lot better than the last time I saw you. - Thanks for coming, Chris. No thanks, and what you did for me? - Hey, Mary Beth never told me what a great kisser you are. - You want your bed up a little bit, Harvey? - No, honey, leave it, it's okay. - So how are you feeling? - Grateful, that's what we're both feeling. - Yeah, I bet you I haven't even thought how grateful we should be that the construction business is so lousy. I'm probably not missing anything laying here flat on my back. - Harvey, you don't need to go stressing yourself about work right now. - Did you call the lawyer? - Oh leave it go for now, Harv. - I'm being sued, Chris. - For what? - My blood and a pound of flesh. - You're getting upset, sweetheart. - This rich ad guy and his spoiled wife who have got nothing more important in their life to worry about are suing because I can't take out a supporting beam in their coop. They don't believe their ceiling's gonna fall in on them. - No jury's gonna award them damages for something like that. - That is exactly what the lawyer said, not to worry about it. (man moaning) - That's probably what Ethel and Julius Rosenberg's lawyers told them too. - That's correct, there's a basic increase of 12% in felony filings in the district attorney's office, and then that's broken down by specific crimes. I'll have my secretary send you the information. - Thanks, Lieutenant, I really appreciate the briefing. - Sure, you're welcome, John. Anytime I can be of help. Bye. (people chattering) - Oh, Lieutenant Cagney Hyphen Burton, another late lunch with the media? - Can it, Feldberg. Public relations is part of my job here. And could you quit it with the Cagney Hyphen Burton routine? It gets old. The gun heist? Why is the DA's office investigating it already? - Because it's possible this was an inside job. And the press will scream coverup if the NYPD investigates itself. - [Christine] Why is it an inside job? - Well the thieves knew everything about the operation. They knew the time, the date, the pier, the personnel. - Anybody coulda known that, it was all over the news. - Oh, and one more thing, and this is definitely not for public consumption, there was an electrified fence and apparently the juice had been turned off. From the inside. - Oh. - A quick thumbnail. One dead sergeant, leaving behind a widow and three kids. 1,500 stolen weapons. They left the junk, they took only the good stuff, mostly automatics, loaded it onto a stolen tug, then onto a truck 10 blocks away, and then that's it, we lose the trail from there. - Any suspects? - As far as we can tell, there was only one person who knew all the particulars of the operation, the commanding officer, someone you know. - Marcus Petrie? No way. Hell, he was at a party at my house last night. - Convenient alibi. - It wasn't Petrie. - Well, one way or the other, the DA and the commissioner wants you to find out fast. Now listen, the press is gonna be crawling all over you, so your only comment is no comment, you got it? Oh, and Cagney, I just want you to know, I told my boss you used to be a hotshot. (door closing) (exhaling) - Celia Sanchez, Action News, aren't you assigned to the DA's office? - Excuse me, please. (reporters shouting) - Does you presence here mean that the DA's office is investigating the weapons hesit? - Look, you're gonna have to talk to Assistant District Attorney Todd Feldberg for any official comments, I'm sorry. - Can't you just give me one comment, just one? - All right, back behind the line here, folks. - Petrie? - Chris. - [Christine] Thanks for meeting me here. - Did I have a choice? Look, Chris, this was my command, my responsibility, and I wanted to keep the case. But that's okay, I understand. Just nail them and I don't care who gets the glory. - You know those guns are probably on their way to Ireland by now? - Or Peru. I've seen forensics. One 32-caliber slug in Nelson's brain, nothing usable in the way of prints. - There's one interesting item, that sample of hair. - I saw. Unprocessed, undyed short blond hair from the barge captain's hat. - Did you notice how much of it there was? Looks like some guy's had a haircut or something. - Except for the follicles, which means it fell out of his scalp. - Look, Petrie, I need you to check-- - My men, I already did, no match. All right, you wanna talk about the elephant in the living room now? I'm under suspicion, aren't I? - I'm not gonna lie to you. There's reason to believe that it's an inside job. - Chris, I've got 20 years on the force. No matter what they might think of me downtown, they can't believe I'm stupid. - Nobody said that. - What else, Lieutenant? I was the one who had all the information. This happened on my watch. How obvious can it get? - I know you didn't do it. But somebody did, and I need your help. - Yeah. - Now have any of your men been flashing around any extra cash lately? (tires squealing) - Nice car. - Thanks. - Must have set you back a bundle, huh? - Who are you? - Lieutenant Cagney-Burton. I wanna ask you a few questions about last night. (horns honking) - Thought they were gonna kill us all. I was, he was a great guy, Sergeant Nelson. And I wanna help out in any way I can to find the bastards who did it. - Okay. The man on the tug, the one who spoke, is there anything you remember, anything distinctive? - I told Lieutenant Petrie, it was dark, he had his face covered, but I thought I heard the trace of an accent. My guess, Eastern European. - Officer, what time is it? - It's a quarter to five, ma'am. - Whoo, oh, that's a beauty, Rolex. Solid gold, huh? 15, 20 thou? That'll go beautifully with your $40,000 car. At this time, Officer Santorini, I think you should be advised of your rights. - My rights? - Complicity in the theft of the guns. - What? What are you, crazy? - You're wearing six months' salary. You're driving another full year's. Hey, call me a worrier, but it does tend to make a person wonder. You have the right to remain silent. - I won the money in Atlantic City. - Lucky guy. - Yeah, I got hot at the craps table, 12 straight passes in a row, $50,000. - Which the casinos make you declare to the IRS, so you don't mind me checking that, do you, to find if that's really where the money came from? - Okay, I didn't win the money in Atlantic City. - No kidding. If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will be held against you. - I know my rights, and I don't want a lawyer. I just don't wanna embarrass her or get her in any trouble. - Her who? - A friend, she's married. - Does your married friend have a name? - Do I have to? - Only if you want to stay out of jail and hang on to your career. - Laurie Bainbridge, remember? They had that $20 million art collection, someone broke in and stole a couple of Picassos, right? Well that's how she met her hot young cop. He's the one who answered the call. - And her husband? - Worth about 500 mill, give or take. - Whoa. - Anyway, I interviewed her about her affair with Santorini. It's true. It's true, she gave him the car. She gave him the watch. They both insist that this is not a fling. They, quote, care very deeply for each other, end quote. Mary Beth, I'm so depressed. - Jeopardizing a marriage like that, you mean? - That Santorini's older woman is seven years younger than I am. And she's so hard up she's gotta pay for it? - Mm. - The way I calculate it, it's about $5,000 a pop. - [Doctor] Oh, Mrs. Lacey? - [Mary Beth] How is he? Tell me the truth. - He's doing just fine. But we're gonna keep him here for a week or so, just to be safe. - Doctor, could you do anything about maybe getting him a quieter room? Do you have any private rooms? - I believe all our doubles are filled, but I could look into the availability of a private room. - No, that's okay, thank you, Doctor. - If you have any questions, you call me. I'll look at him later tonight. - I wish you hadn't done that. - Mary Beth, look, how is Harvey supposed to recuperate when he's in there with some moron who keeps yelling his head off? I mean, if it were my husband-- - Well it's not your husband. - Mary Beth, wait a minute. Wait. Look, if it's the money, I can loan it to you. - Oh I bet you could. - Why are you so pissed at me? - Christine. - It's not charity. - I mean, you can pay me back when you get some money. - And when will that be? - When Harvey goes back to work. Or don't pay it, I don't care. - I appreciate your generosity, Christine, but there is no problem here. Retirement's not what it's cracked up to be. I'm going back to work. - You didn't tell me. Where? - I have a lot of interesting possibilities. I'm weighing offers now. But thanks anyhow. (upbeat music) - [Iris] So, basically, your only job experience is as a police officer? - Detective. - Whatever. Truthfully, Mrs. Lacey, it would make my job a lot easier if you had some sort of sales experience or secretarial skills. - Oh, geez, I musta typed 30,000 police reports over the years. - Touch typing on a computer? - Hunt and peck on a manual. Typewriter. Listen, I really need a job, Miss Lewiston, so, is it Miss or Mrs? Well, whatever. I'll do what's necessary, and I'll work like a dog. - Come on, Feldberg, I'm not even supposed to be doing this job. I gotta get some help here. There's 3,500 gun dealers in this city, and all you can spare are three men? Give me a-- Yeah. Yeah, I'm interviewing the heavyweights, but I gotta have someone help me with the scut work. Well thank you for your support, you're a real sport. - Yes, we hire a lotta ex-cops. I'll have to put you on the list. It's eight bucks an hour in the beginning. After your six months, I give you a bump. - What about medical? - No benefit. We start the midnight-to-eight shift. After you're here a while, I guarantee two or three nights a week. That's the best I can do. (upbeat music) - Pardon me. (upbeat music) - May I help you? - I am here for the receptionist job. - We're all here for the receptionist job. (upbeat music) (soft dramatic music) (men chattering) (machine humming) - Excuse me, I'm looking for an Alexander Nemaroff. I was told-- Mansfield. - What a pleasant surprise. My, my, all grown up. (laughing) But please call me Nemaroff, Alexander Nemaroff. Would you excuse us for a moment, please? - You're Nemaroff? - In the witness protection program, they told me I could have any name I wanted. And then vetoed Cary Grant. So I chose Alexander Nemaroff. Has a poetic quality, don't you think? Besides, it's very helpful in helping me to exploit the new capitalist frontiers of Eastern Europe. - I can't believe you had the Jones to come back to New York. - Oh, Raphael Lopez is dead. Nobody in the organization cares that I helped convict him. Fear, it seems, like fame, is fleeting. So, I decided to come home and remake my fortune. (crowbar rattling) Listen to me, you degenerates. If one jar is broken in that crate, I'll see you all deported back to whatever godforsaken hellhole you came here from. - [Christine] You're importing guns from Russia? - Absolutely not. - Says here that you're a weapons importer. License issued to Alexander Nemaroff. - The importation of certain foreign automatic weapons is now prohibited by our government. You should know that Sergeant Cagney. And it only hastens the decision I'd come to anyway. The unrestricted ownership of guns is tearing apart the fabric of our society. - Lieutenant, you hypocrite. - Oh congratulations. Now I know there's nothing I can say that will ever convince you, Lieutenant, that I am not the same man that I once was. - I don't wanna hear this crap. You did it, didn't you? You stole those guns. - I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. - The guns from the barge. You did it, didn't you? - That sounds uncomfortably like libel. I wouldn't be throwing around those accusations if I were you. - I'm just quaking in my shoes, Mansfield. - Nemaroff, Alexander Nemaroff. New man, new name. I still have some contacts from my old days. I'll ask around. If you'll leave me your card, perhaps I'll hear something that might be of help to you. - Rot in hell, Mansfield. Rot in hell. (men chattering) - Arms. Ready! Aim, fire! (guns firing) Ready! Aim, fire! (guns firing) Ready! Aim, fire! (guns firing) Ready! Aim, fire! (guns firing) Ready! Aim, fire! (guns firing) Order, arms! (bagpipes music playing) - It was Mansfield, that son of a bitch. I know he stole those guns. - This is a funeral, Christine. Sergeant Matthew Nelson of the NYPD has passed away in the line of duty, and we are here to pay our respects. - He says he's no longer in the weapons business. I know he is connected to this, I know he is. - What you know is you want him connected to it. Wasn't Marcus' eulogy touching? - Yeah, it was great. If you will remember, Mansfield tried to kill me, for God sake. He is a murder and a drug dealer, and he didn't even get his hand slapped. No, he gets this cushy little witness relocation. - Enough, Christine. You have to stop with this craziness. - There was a cop connection, Mary Beth. That slime ball turned a good cop dirty. A good cop who was working the gun detail. - What are you implying? Marcus? - He knew all the details of the operation. He had access to that electrified fence, and last week, he put an offer on a new coop. - I didn't know that. - Mm-hmm. - I'm sure there's an explanation. - I hope so. - You never liked Marcus. - For God sake, this is not about like or dislike. And I'm sick of defending myself. - I'm gonna go and pay my respects. Are you coming? - No, you go ahead, I barely knew him. - All right, give me a minute. - Have you ordered Petrie to come in yet? - This is a funeral, Feldberg. I'm gonna do it afterwards. - Well he's the only cop who knew the whole operation. (soft chattering) - No he wasn't. (traffic passing) - Alice, drink your milk. - Jennifer's mom lets her have diet soda. She says it has less calories. - Jennifer's mom also wears Spandex. (door buzzing) Milk please. - Good morning. - What are you doing here? - How's Harvey feeling? - He's doing okay, thank God. - Good. - Why are you here? - I need your help on a case. I know, you're not a cop anymore, the only time I ever come over is when I need your help, and you're probably still worried about Harvey. Did I miss anything? - Alice, do you remember your Aunt Christine? - I'm the one that sends the birthday cards. A dollar a year. - Hello, Aunt Christine. - Hi. - You ready to go? Get your lunch. Yeah, you missed that I'm about to walk Alice to school. - You do this every day? - The only mother who does. - Oh. Well, then, Alice, how would you like to ride in a district attorney's car? - Yeah. - Yeah! - Yeah. (children chattering) (brakes squealing) - Be a good girl, now, you hear me? Have a good time, give me a kiss. What do you say? - Bye, Aunt Christine, thanks for the ride. - You're very welcome, Alice. - Mom says you live in a fancy schmancy townhouse. Can I come over and see it sometime? - Absolutely, any time you want. Thank you. - Lunch. Now hurry up now. (school bell ringing) (door closing) Let me watch her go in. - She's all right. So grown up. - Yeah, it goes fast. Could we turn the air conditioner off? - Aren't you hot? I'm hot. - I'm freezing. What are you, sick? - No, I'm fine. This is great, huh? This is just great, feels great. - What does? - This. You know, riding around in the car and talking things out. (laughing) Like the old days when we were young and ambitious. - You were ambitious. All I wanted to do was make my 20 years and adios. - Yeah. God, remember when I thought I was gonna be the first female police commissioner someday? - And now? - Well. - What happened? - They say I have a bad attitude, can you imagine? A bad attitude. The truth? I think it's the glass ceiling. - [Mary Beth] So push through it. Glass breaks. - Yeah, well, it's my choice too. I'm gonna wanna spend more time in my personal life. - So that's okay, if it's your choice. - Some of it. I don't know. It's just the whole thing. I guess I let system beat me down. What? What are you looking at me with that evil eye for? - Because I hate to hear you talk like that, Christine. You are the best, most talented cop that I ever worked with. New York City should be so lucky as to have you for a commissioner. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I still can't get anything on Mansfield. - Christine, it is possible that he didn't do it. - If he is a legitimate importer, then I am Dr. Quinn. (laughing) I got the DA and the press crawling all over me. - What do they expect, miracles like always? You'll do it, you know you will. You always did. - This is just great. I really appreciate you coming with me, Mary Beth. Deborah Nelson's gonna feel a lot more comfortable talking to me with you there. Can we turn on the air, just for a bit? (air conditioner blowing) (switch clicking) - Would you run that Deborah Nelson thing by me one more time? - I hope we're not coming at a bad time. - No, no, as a matter of fact, it's a good time. I made the kids go back to school today, and I didn't know what to do with myself. - Listen, I could go to the store with you later if you need to go. - Oh, no no no, I have a whole refrigerator full of food left over from the wake. Do you want something? Can I make you a sandwich or something? - Oh no thank you. - No thanks, Deborah. - Actually, Mrs. Nelson, I'm wondering if you wouldn't mind if I asked you a few questions. - It's okay, Deb. Matthew would want you to help find his killer. And, she only wants to know if he ever talked to you about any of his men. - What do you mean? - It's possible that one of them was involved. And anything that Matt might have said could be useful. Like if he ever talked about something not being on the up and up with somebody. - Oh, he never talked to me about work. - [Christine] Never? - No. Matt knew that I hated that he was a cop. When we first got married, he was just doing it to get through law school. But then he never finished and time went by and oh God. Oh God, I wish I had some of that time. Oh God. It's not supposed to just go by like that. Is it, Mary Beth? - No, no, it shouldn't. Deb, let me get you some coffee. - That's a good idea. I'd like some myself, why don't I get some for everybody? - You know, last night I was having the most, most beautiful dream. It was about Matt and me, it was our last vacation. We were lying on the beach. It was warm, and the waves were lapping at our feet. When I woke up, the pain started again. - [Mary Beth] Deborah, listen to me. There's this thing they have, it's called grief counseling. And a neighbor of mine went when she lost her sister. She says it saved her life. - [Deborah] No, I'm gonna be okay. I will be okay, I have to take care of the kids. (soft dramatic music) (Mary Beth and Deb chattering) - I want you to call her later, soon as she stops crying, and ask her a few more questions. - About what? - I just found a full pound of Beluga caviar in the refrigerator. - What were you doing snooping in her icebox? - I wasn't snooping. I was looking for milk for the coffee. Anyway, I happened to find almost $1,000 worth of fish eggs. - Wait a minute. You told me that Matt Nelson was not under suspicion here. - Well he wasn't, really, until I found the caviar. Now I'm having a hard time figuring out how he can afford Beluga caviar on a cop's salary. - She said people brought food for the wake. - Well, sure, I always bring $1,000 worth of gourmet food to wakes, don't you? Anyway, I want you to ask her if he was throwing around money before his death, and find out where they went on that vacation she was talking about. - No, I'm not gonna sandbag a friend. - We are investigating a potentially crooked cop. - I'm not investigating anybody, Lieutenant. (horn honking) (passersby chattering) (train passing) - So tell me, how's the job search going, Mary Beth? - What? Fine, fine, I have some very nice prospects. - So, I suppose you wouldn't consider being a cop again. - Chris, I been off the force three years. They can't take me back, you know that. - You can be a DA's investigator. We've got civilians, just like we've got uniforms, and you'd be doing exactly the same thing that a police detective does, only you do it as a civilian. - I'm retired. Nah, naw, it's been too long. - I just saw you, you're great. You still can play those people like violins. - I was not. I'm not gonna play Deborah Nelson for you. - God, I miss this, Mary Beth, come on. Driving around together, you know, throwing out ideas, talking things over. - Bickering. - Whatever, it works. I was getting nowhere on this case. And now, look, things are slowly starting to open. Come on, say yes. Come on. Come work with me. - With you? - Yeah. - You mean for you, don't you, you'd be my boss? - I was your sergeant. It's just a title, it doesn't mean anything. Come on, Mary Beth, the money's great. And the medical plan is excellent. With Harvey being sick, I think that would count for a lot. - No, I got out. I made my 20, I was lucky. I only got shot at eight or nine times. I only got hit once. I swore I'd never pick up a gun again. Poor Harvey was always worried when I was on the street. God. I can't get over Harvey, laying there on your floor. - Mm. - You got an opening? - We've got an opening. - Well how do you know they'll take me? - I can swing this, Mary Beth. You tell me you want the job, you're in. - And I'm forever in your debt. - Would you cut the crap, Mary Beth? Harvey's sick, you need a job, this is a great job. And I could use some help. So say yes, okay? (horn honking) You'd hardly be in my debt at all. (laughing) (phone ringing) - Why the hell not? - She retired to take care of her kids, as I remember. You know what this is? This is a scam to get around the regulations prohibiting her from rejoining the police force, right? - You have other ex-cops who work as investigators. - You know, I also remember what it was like when there were two of you ganging up on me. It was the cuckoo clock syndrome. One steps back, the other gets right in my face. Then back again, no thanks. - She was a great detective. - Yeah, emphasis on was. - Are you saying she's too old? Because if you are, Mr. Feldberg, you just bought yourself an age discrimination lawsuit. - Now wait a second, Cagney. I never said that she was too old. - My bet is, if her first name were Manny instead of Mary-- - Will you hold on a second here? - We wouldn't be having this discussion. - God, you're a pain in the ass, Cagney Hyphen Burton. - Thank you. Is that a yes? - Lieutenant Cagney, is it true that the investigation is focusing on a member of the police department as a possible co-conspirator in the theft from the barge? - I'm sorry, I have no comment at this time. - You just missed yourself on TV. You were even more articulate than usual tonight. - Cute. Okay, uh, um. All right, which one? - They're both beautiful, we're late. - Yeah. - I thought that this job with the DA was supposed to be nine to five. - Well, actually, it's just this one case, and I'm finally getting some help. I always look dumpy in this one, don't I? - You look fine. - I'll wear the other. You do know this case is a total boondoggle? - [Christine] No, actually, I do not. - It's obvious, they've set you up to be the scapegoat. Those guns are long gone, you're never gonna find them. But at least the mayor and the DA'll have someone else to blame. - Sounds pretty paranoid to me. - It's not paranoid, realistic. - Purse, shoes, gun. - What's the gun for? - Mansfield tried to kill me once. I'm not taking any chances. - God, I hate your job. - Why don't we just agree to disagree? Okay? Oh God, this is even worse. - Why would somebody wanna work who doesn't have to? - You just feel that way because you're bored with your job. - Honey, come on, you look fine. - Fine? - Gorgeous. - Hey, troops. - [Michael] Hi, Ma. (dramatic music on TV) - What are you watching? - Basic Instinct. - I don't want you watching that. I don't want her watching that. - We're right in the middle, Ma. - Do you have any brains, Michael? Your sister is eight years old. - The movie's cool. Did you see it, Mom? When they're questioning Sharon Stone at the police station? - Hey, hey, your daddy says hi, give you a kiss, tell you it's bedtime, go brush your teeth. The doctor says he's doing good. He's doing fine. He should be home, couple, three days. - That's good. So anyway, I guess if I'm done with my babysitting duties, I'm gonna go, okay. - Now I need you again tomorrow night. And you cannot let her watch violent, oversexy movies, Michael. - Look, Mom, I'm sorry I screwed up. But you know, maybe just once you could thank me for what I did right, like becoming a monk so I could babysit for you, instead of bitching at me for what I did wrong, huh? - You're right. I thank you, Michael, for helping out. - I love you, Mom. I know you're going through a lot. Oh, Mom, I got a problem. Forget it, never mind, you got a-- - No, Michael, don't do this to me, tell me. - It's just, my rent's due and some bills. - How much? - $500. - $500? Michael, your father's in the hospital. - Alice says that you're going back to work, so. - Yeah, I got a job. And so could you. - I mean, come on, it's not like I'm not trying. It's a hard economy out there. Look, I shouldn't have mentioned it. - What are you gonna do about your rent? - It's not your problem, I shouldn't have laid it on you. - I can't cover the whole thing, Michael. I'll give you $200, that's it. (phone ringing) - Want me to get it? - Yeah. Deborah? What? No, just, hang on, hang on for a few minutes. I'll be right over. Yeah. Michael, I need you for a little while. - Ma, I can't. - Honey, an hour. - I can't, Ma, honestly, I can't. All right, thanks for the money. (door closing) - Alice? - Honey, I need you to read your book in here, okay? And we're gonna be talking in the next room, okay? - Okay. - I probably overreacted, I should have waited till morning. - No no, I said call me, I meant it. - It's not like I'm suicidal or anything like that. It's nothing like that, it's just that I-- - Slow down, okay. Tell me, okay. - Okay. I got around to the mail today. Got myself together and decided to pay some bills. And I came across this charge on the bank statement, something I didn't understand. It's for a, um, a second safe deposit box. We already have a safe deposit box. It has the insurance stuff and the wills. - Did you find a key for this other box? - No. But I don't know why Matthew would get a second safe deposit box without telling me. - There's a lot of possibilities, Deb, but before you say anything more, I have to tell you something. I'm working for the DA's office now. - So, what does that mean? - That means that I have to report this conversation, and it means that they are trying to figure out about the stolen guns. - You think Matt was stealing guns? - It's possible. - I don't know. I don't know what to do. Why don't you just tell me what to do, Mary Beth? - As a DA investigator, I tell you you should come with me tomorrow to the bank, and we'll see what's in the box. As a friend, I don't know, probably the same thing. It'd be an awful big secret to live with. (soft dramatic music) (pumping) (soft dramatic music) - Thank you. (soft dramatic music) - Would you open it? I'm afraid. Please. - Sure. (soft dramatic music) (gasping) - Oh God. I did this. I did this to him. - No, Deborah. - I nagged him all the time. What we had was never enough. It's my fault he did it, my fault! I killed him, I killed him, I killed him. (soft dramatic music) - Okay, come on. Let me get your coat. You know, Harvey, if you're feeling too tired, you could go right in and take a nap. - For Pete sakes, Mary Beth, you asked me three times already, I'm okay. Hey, wait a minute, what is this? Hey, this is okay. - Surprise! - Pumpkin, come here. Oh, sweetheart. - Come on, just be careful. - I missed you. This is great, this is just terrific. - How you feeling, Harv? - Hey. - Oh great, the doctors say great. You know, he's out two days sooner than usual for what he had. - Thanks, Chris. - Hi. - [Harvey] Thanks again for coming. - [Christine] My pleasure. - Hey. Good to see you. Your mom says you been a big help these days. Thank you, Michael. - That's okay. - Hey, you just missed Harv Junior, he called from Quantico. - Oh, what a shame. - We'll try him again in a couple of minutes. Hey, this is okay. Wow, this is great. Hey, maybe I should have a heart attack more often, huh? (laughing) - Hey, Chris, how you doing? - Hey, Harvey, can I get you something? - No thanks, I'm on a real strict diet. All I can eat is rabbit food and some bread baked outta wood chips or something. - This is good, Harvey, listen, you take off a couple of pounds, you'll lower your cholesterol, you'll be good as new. So how you feeling really? - Well I hope the doctors know what they're doing letting me out this early. - Harv, Harvey? You're not supposed to be running around. If you want something, let me know. - I'm supposed to walk, I'm just walking around my own home. - Actually, Harvey, this is a conspiracy. Mary Beth and I asked them to let you out early because we need you for day care (laughs). - Day care? Somebody wanna tell me what's going on around here? - [Mary Beth] That damn Christine never could keep her mouth shut. - Not Christine's fault, Mary Beth. She had every reason to figure you woulda told me something as big as taking a job. - [Mary Beth] I knew you wouldn't like it. I didn't want you to get upset. - Mary Beth, would you come outta there so we could talk please? - [Mary Beth] I'll be out in 28 minutes. - What the heck are you doing in there? - Okay, don't get upset. I'm coloring my hair. - Oh, Mary Beth. - Harvey, if you don't want me to go back with Christine and I have to take some entry-level job at some hamburger store, then I have to be 14. - What are you talking about? You are not gonna do this again, Mary Beth. - Honey, it's not like before. It's a desk job almost. Regular hours, no situations. We need money, so I took a job, it's no big deal. - Yeah? Then why didn't you tell me if it's no big deal? - Honey, it's temporary, I promise. Just till you get back on your feet. That's all. Don't be mad at me, Harvey. I missed you. Lonely in this bed without you. After I rinse this off, you wanna fool around. - Geez, Mary Beth, in case you forgot, I just had a heart attack. - You could just lay there, I'll do all the work. - Oh, Mary Beth, what's going on? - Honey, I talked to the doctor. He said that sex is really very good for the heart. - Maybe later, huh? I'm just beat. Feels so good to be in my own bed, I just wanna sleep. (soft piano music) (knocking on door) - Chris, I am so sorry to be late. The traffic on the expressway is even worse than it used to be, I'll start earlier tomorrow. - That's okay, how's Harvey doing? - You know, it's hard. Getting used to the idea, I mean I was the one that was sick, Harvey was always healthy as a horse. I guess I never thought that anything could ever happen to him. - Doctor said he was gonna be fine. - And he will be. So, Lieutenant, what's my first assignment? You want me to start with Sergeant Nelson's telephone log? - No, you gotta go to personnel first. They're gonna give you a desk and some supplies, and then, you've just a couple of little tests you gotta take. - Tests? - Mm, you know, little medical exam and then qualify with a weapon and then there's some physical fitness deal they do. - The gun? I haven't fired a gun in three years. - So you practice. - What kinda little physical fitness deal? - You scale a 50-foot wall, run a four-minute mile, and then you swim the English Channel. Ha ha. No, it's some rinky dink little test, you know, that they make you do just so they can be assured that you're not gonna have this massive heart attack the first time you walk from your car to the doughnut stand. Oh, I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking, sorry. - Sensitivity never was your strong point, Christine. - Well thank you so much. You know, I have missed having my character defects pointed out to me the first thing every morning. Anyway, I'm scheduled to interview Nelson's ex-partner, his poker buddies and some kid he went to grade school with, so why don't you get yourself together, and then I'll see you tomorrow, okay? - Okay. (passersby chattering) Going to personnel, right? - Right. - [Mary Beth] Chris, is that this floor? - Down the hall and to the right, first door on your left. - Uh-huh. - Yes, sir, I'll be at the firing range at two o'clock, if that's the way you want it, but I'm telling you, I really think I could do better if I had a chance to practice first. Fine, that is the way you want it. But I'm telling you, I haven't picked up a weapon in three and a half years. Yes, sir. The guy's a little bit of a horse's neck, huh? (light music) (guns firing) (light music) (guns firing) (machine whirring) (light music) - I told you I was outta practice. - All right, come back next week. But remember, you only have one more chance to qualify. - Yes, sir. (upbeat music) - Jimmy, what are you doing here? - Well, since you never come home anymore. - Is it nine o'clock already? - Mm-hmm. - Aw, Jim, I'm so sorry. It's just this stuff is so damn frustrating. I have got personnel files, I've got bank records, I've got telephone logs, I have interviews with every single person who ever knew Matthew Nelson, and I cannot find any connection to Mansfield, much less anybody else. If I just could figure out where the $50,000 came from, then I would know who has the guns and this isn't grabbing you at all, is it? Yeah, you wanna go to dinner? I haven't had one thing with any vitamins in it all day. - Bill called me. - Bill who? (chuckling) - Bill? - He's offered me assistant secretary of the treasury. - Oh, honey, I'm sorry. - No, no no, this isn't like that last thing. This is something I want. - Oh, you, you wanna move to Washington and everything? - Well, I told him we'd need a day or two to talk it over. What about it? You like control, power. There's no place in the world that has more of it. New York is a village compared to Washington. What do you say? (soft music) - I've been waiting for you, let's go. - It's 8:02. - There was a gang shooting last night in the South Bronx. The gun recovered off the body of the victim was one of the weapons stolen from the barge. - I thought you said they were shipping those outta the country. - So I was wrong. - Oh, great. - No, this is good for our side. As long as the guns are in the country, the easier it is to follow the trail. - Well I'm sorry to disagree with you, Lieutenant, but this is not good for our side. Any time that 1,500 more guns are on the streets of New York City. - [Christine] Always the last word, huh? - [Mary Beth] So? Stop it. (shutter clicking) (officers chattering) - Victor, what are you doing here? - Gangs, gangs, I do this for a living. What are you doing here? - Working as a DA investigator now. - Oh, that's terrific. Is that why you dyed your hair? Hey, I hear that Harvey's on the mend. - Could you guys have this little reunion some other time? Isbecki, we need to know the ID of the victim. - I'm working on it. From the look of his clothes, he was in the local Nueves gang. - What we really need to know is where'd they get the gun. - We saw you on TV, Cagney. You think this was one of the stolen guns from the barge? - Where did he get his gun, Isbecki? - Ginger said you looked great. - Victor? - All right. You'll wanna talk to the armor of the local Nueves. Each gang buys from one particular dealer. Until two months ago, Jamie Ortiz was the supplier for the local Nueves. Unfortunately, he is now at Riker's. - I don't care what happened two months ago. Who has the action now? - I don't know, I'm trying to find out. - When? - When I find out, okay, Cagney? - Sooner rather than later, okay, Isbecki? - Thank you, Victor. You behaved beautifully. - This is stupid, we should have eaten in the car and saved some time. - No, we're gonna sit down for a full 20 minutes and eat like actual human beings and get your blood sugar evened out. Maybe you'll start acting a little bit more civilized. Oh, Chris, I'm sorry. I know you hate personal criticism. - I do not. It's not that. It's just, I didn't get very much sleep last night. Jim and I have some decisions to make. - Oh Lord, Christine, you're not talking divorce? - No, no, not like that at all. It's good, really, they're high-class problems. It's just that they're complicated. - You wanna talk to me about it? - Is it hot in here? I think they have the heat up to 100 degrees. - I'm not hot, but you're sweaty, Christine. - I'm not sweaty. (crying) My mother said that horses sweat. And men perspire and women glow. - Aw, I bet you're having a little hot flash. - Hot flash, what are you talking about? - You know what I'm talking about. Change of life. - Change? Menopause? Are you nuts? I'm too young for that. - Not really, Christine. The average age is about 50. - I am not 50. My mother went through it at 64, my aunt at 60, and you can set your watch by my periods. - A couple years before your mensies stop, you start getting symptoms. I'll bet that's why you been so emotional lately. - Would you stop? It is not menopause, it's hot in here! Waitress! Yes, you, it's like a frigging sauna in here. Could you turn down the damn heat? Please. - Hey, Cagney, where's Lacey? - What do I look like, her secretary? She's taking her physical. Hey, did you find the name of that gun supplier for me yet? - His name is Lewis Rashad. The funny thing is he's a licensed gun dealer. Has a pawn shop on 113th Street. - But he sells illegal guns on the side? - Snitch who gave me his name said so. But then again, he may need 50 bucks to stuff up his nose. - No problem, he sounds like a perfectly good confidential reliable informant to me. That should qualify for a search warrant. We don't have a problem with that, do we, Victor? Perfect. - [Christine] You have quite a collection here. - Lady, why are you rousting me? I'm a registered dealer! - Well if you have nothing to hide, Mr. Rashad, then the less interference you give us the sooner we're gonna be out of your hair. I want the numbers checked on those. - Now you tell me who says I'm selling illegal guns, because he's lying. - Thank you for sharing that. I want the numbers on those, too. - Why you keep harassing us working men? You know it's government interference with the African American man that keeps this neighborhood in permanent poverty. You hear what I'm saying? Every weapon you find in this place is bought and paid for and legal as an ice cream cone. - What a terrifying thought. - Lady, I don't keep guns in no refrigerator. - Mr. Rashad, why don't you go get your paperwork so we can check it against the weapons we've found? (officers chattering) (soft dramatic music) - So, honey, I'll pick you up at eight. Listen, don't wear that perfume, though, because I think I'm allergic. I got a rash. - I got it, I got our guy! - Honey, let me call you back. What, who, Rashad? - He's the middle guy. The big man is Bruce Mansfield, aka Alexander Nemaroff. Gangster, murderer, arms and drugs dealer. Here's his rap sheet. - Oh, great, what do we got here? - I found an empty can of caviar in Rashad's trash. - Yeah, so? - What's a guy named Rashad doing with caviar? - Oh this is gonna go over great in court. On the witness stand, our sharp-eyed Lieutenant Cagney-Burton relates how she could understand finding a watermelon on the premises of the black man, no problem, but caviar? Well, what more did she need? Book him for possession of fish eggs. Oh, and while you're at it, hang him because we suspect him of selling illegal guns. - Feldberg, I did my homework. Bruce Mansfield is currently the exclusive importer of Empress Catherine Caviar, the same stuff that both Nelson and Rashad had at their places. - Oh, well, now I'm impressed. - Don't you see? It is not a coincidence. - And so what, so he passes out caviar as a business perk? - Maybe, I don't know, but it's him. I'm sure of it. - You know, according to this file you've had some pretty heavy dealings with this guy before. Are you sure you're not letting your emotions interfere with your investigation? - Look, I know it looks a little thin, but that is the connection, I know that it is, and I know that he did it. - Yeah, well, even if you're right, we're gonna need a hell of a lot more for a conviction. - Right. So, I need you to authorize a gun buy and find a judge who's liberal about phone taps. (light music) - Other than walking my little girl to and from school, I haven't been getting much exercise. - Don't be intimidated, Mrs. Lacey. We recognize new DA investigators do mostly mental gymnastics, not a lotta run and gun. (laughing) All we require are 15 pushups, 25 situps and a 12-minute mile. - Hmm. - [Trainer] Why don't we get situps out of the way? - Oh, yes. (upbeat music) You understand that I am on a case here? I really don't have a lot of time. - That's two, only 23 more. (groaning) (light music) (groaning) - See how nice it is when you come home at night? - Yes, Mr. Burton. - Let's talk about how you wanna set up housekeeping in Washington. - Housekeeping? Jimmy, these jobs have been known to be kind of temporary, you know, I mean, Clinton being reelected isn't exactly a slam dunk. - Honey, he's gonna be in office at least a couple of more years, and I can't exactly commute. (sighing) You did put the confirmation hearings in your calendar? - Of course I put them in. But I don't know-- - No buts. There's some Republicans on the committee. Having a cop in the family couldn't hurt. (soft music) - Jimmy? Honey, remember I told you about that case I'm working on, the Mansfield one? And I'm gonna try and not have it conflict but, if it does, I may not be able to go to the confirmation hearing. - You say may not be able to go there like you might not be able to pick up the dry cleaning. - That's not fair. - Fair? We're talking about a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. - God I hate this. I just hate that it's the '90s and we're still fighting the same stupid fight. (phone ringing) Mary Beth? Oh I'm sorry. Oh, of course, yes, sir. Yes, he's right here. Yes, I'll get him for you. - Yes, Mr. President. No, of course it's not too late to call. (upbeat music) - Honey, I'm taking off. - Hey, what about breakfast, babe? - No, I don't wanna be late again. - Mary Beth, you gotta have something. That's what you kept telling me, just a bagel and some juice. Listen, don't let Alice forget her lunch. - [Harvey] Don't worry, I won't. - I'm gonna be late again. The alarm went off, I swear, I couldn't even move. - Well it's hard, baby, you've become a lady of leisure. - No, honey, it's not that. It's that physical test yesterday. My belly still aches from the situps, and my arms hurt so much I could hardly pick up my toothbrush. I just, I didn't even pass, Harv. I couldn't run that mile to save my life. (upbeat music) - Sorry to put you through all this stuff, Mary Beth. - Honey, that's not what I mean. - I just feel like crap, I mean, putting all this pressure on you. - No, it's okay, Harvey. Don't listen to me complain, doesn't mean anything. - I'm gonna start looking for a job. I'm gonna make some phone calls this morning. - Harvey, that is crazy. You've only been out of the hospital less than a week. You have to give yourself some time to recover, please. - Okay. Won't be long I'll be back on my feet. You won't have to work. - Don't worry about anything, sweetheart. All I want is enough recovery so that you can become my own personal sex slave again. - Hey, your daughter's gonna be out here any minute, and I gotta get your bagel before it burns. (upbeat music) - I don't want it, honey. (knocking on door) - Chris? (light music) Chris? Christine? (crying) (light music) Is that you? - Don't I get any damn privacy anywhere? (crying) - Are you okay? - I am fine. - Well you don't look fine? You look like you been crying? (sniffling) - Don't you miss the old can at the 14th? That was a really good place to cry your eyes out. This place is so damn clean. It just isn't very satisfying. - Menopausal mood swings-- - It is not menopausal mood swings. It's Jim. (crying) Bill called last night. - Bill? - As in Hillary and Bill? - [Mary Beth] Bill the president? - Yeah. He's appointing Jimmy assistant secretary to the treasury. - Treasury? Oh, Christine, that's wonderful. (sobbing) It's not wonderful? - I just n-- I just never thought I was ever gonna get married, Mary Beth. - Because you hadn't met the right guy. The assistant secretary of the treasury. - It's funny, you know, Jimmy and I never had very much in common. Except that we were both in AA, and and I guess that we weren't very good at relationships, but we were looking at it and we were gonna work on that. (sniffling) - You're not happy with James? - It's not his job to make me happy. Anyway, I never said I was unhappy. - Well what then? (sniffling) - It's more like, beige. - Beige? - My life is, beige. - President of the United States Clinton calls you up at home and your life is beige? - For God sake, I'm not even a Democrat. - Oh my God, Christine, you're moving to Washington? - I am not moving to Washington. Jim's moving to Washington. - Oh my God, Christine, I'm so sorry. - Would you stop it, Mary Beth? I'm not getting divorced. It's only a plane ride away, one hour, and I can see him on the weekends. - Uh-huh. - It's called a commuter marriage, Mary Beth. Millions of couples do it. - Uh-huh. - Anyway, I'm fine, really. (crying) - Uh-huh. So why are you crying? - I don't know, you tell me. God, please tell me that it's hot in here. (knocking on door) What? - [Todd] Your secretary told me you'd been in there an hour. - Yes. - Female problems? - Chris. - I'm so sorry. - For the record, that wasn't harassment. That was an expression of concern. I just wanted you to know I got you the phone taps and the money for the gun buy. - Thank you. - Gun buy, what gun buy? - I would do it myself, but Rashad's already seen me. - It's okay, Christine, gee, it's not the first time I ever went undercover. - What you gotta keep in mind is that Lewis Rashad is a very street smart and dangerous guy. - I think we oughta put a wire on her. - No, no wire. This very street smart dangerous guy finds a wire on me. - Okay, okay, you're right, I don't care about a wire. Anyway, the purpose of this exercise is not to catch Rashad. - It's to catch Mansfield. - No. It's to find out who Rashad calls whenever he wants an illegal weapon. Whoever that is. If it happened to be Mansfield, then that would be fine. - Gee, fine, okay, I get it. So what's my cover? - A Queens housewife. - There's a stretch. And what logical reason does this Queens housewife have for going all the way to the South Bronx for a gun? - This is pretty brilliant, all right. You're a Queens housewife who's looking for an illegal and obviously unregistered assault weapon. - To bring to PTA meetings? - No, to blow away your scumbag husband and make it look like it happened in a gang-related burglary. - That's not bad. I could wear sunglasses, you know, sorta Married to the Mob. Only except we paint a shiner underneath that I accidentally let Rashad see. The implication of course being that I wanna blow him away because he's been slugging me around. - Oh, and also he's leaving you for another woman. - I don't think so, Christine. - [Christine] Well it's logical. I mean, he beats you and he's cheating on you. - No, he's not cheating on me. - This is ridiculous, it's the oldest reason in the world. - No, Christine. - Mary Beth, give me one earthly reason why not. - Because he isn't, no husband of mine is gonna cheat on me. - Mary Beth. - End of discussion, Christine, there is no girlfriend. - Mary Beth, there is no husband. The whole thing is made up. All right, there's no girlfriend. Moving on, the reason you're not buying it in your own neighborhood is because you're afraid of being recognized. And, um, you got Rashad's name from who? - Chewy Gatto. One of my snitches. - Okay, you wanna practice? - Yeah. - All right, you come in the store, I'll be Rashad. - Okay, um. Knock, knock, knock, I'm here. - [Christine] Yeah, can I help you? - Um, are you Mr. Rashad? - Who's asking? - Well I got your name from a friend of a friend. A Chewy Gatto. He said that maybe you could help me on a special order. (sobbing) (laughing) Is that too much? - No. - You want me to do it again? - No. (soft dramatic music) (horn honking) (traffic passing) - She's been in there too long, I'm going in. - Just give her a few more minutes. - She's one week back on the job. Already I've got her putting her life in danger. - Look, she knows what she's doing, don't blow it for her. (chattering) Cagney. (soft dramatic music) (laughing) See, she did it. - Why hasn't he called? - Well he's not gonna call from his own phone, especially not after your raid. Just be patient. - Patient, hey look, Isbecki. - I'm sorry, I forgot. - What's that supposed to mean? - Let's just say you're the same Christine Cagney that I always knew and adored. - Lieutenant, he's leaving the shop. (soft dramatic music) - How many phones do we have on the street? - Just one in this direction. - One? - The phone by the alley. If he calls for the weapons from there, we've got him. - Oh come on, stop. - [Techi] He's passing it. - Dammit! Why wouldn't they let us tap any more phones? - [Victor] Oh come on. Come on. He's coming back. - That's it, come on, pick up the phone. - Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. - Punch in that number, you bastard. (soft dramatic music) - We got it. It's somewhere out on Staten Island. - Yeah! (dramatic music) - Where are you going? - I'm going with you. - You don't even have a gun yet, wait in the car. (dramatic music) - Cops. - Damn. (dramatic music) - Sweet Jesus. - There's somebody back there. (soft dramatic music) - [Officer] Freeze hold it right there! (dramatic music) - I've got one back here, hold it! (gun firing) Dammit, I'm not gonna warn you again. (dramatic music) - Hey, there's one up here! (dramatic music) - Stay here. (dramatic music) (grunting) - Gee, it's lucky they won't give me a gun yet. Who knows where I mighta shot him? (soft dramatic music) - Let me share with you my sincere belief that despite all the media hoopla, what you ladies actually have with respect to my client is a case of very small potatoes at best. - We found 1,500 stolen guns in a warehouse rented in Mr. Korbutt's name. - Small potatoes, like I said, receiving stolen property. - Not to mention a mountain of other illegal weapons. - So you wanna do the taxpayers a favor? We'll plead right now, probation and a $1,000 fine. What do you say? - Excuse me, I'm sorry, Mr. Korbutt, I didn't mean to stare, that's very rude of me. I wondered, would you mind removing your cap? (siren in distance) I just love that color. I really should take you with me to my hairdresser. - Pardon me, Lieutenant, would you? - Excuse me just one moment. (whispering) Well what do you know? I don't need to take you with me at all, look. I already have a swatch. - What is this? - It's a hair sample. That I'd be willing to bet matches whatever hair is left on your client's head. - You know, with his condition, he's lucky he has hair left at all. - That's true, I've read about this, it's called alopecia. Isn't it, Korbutt? Usually all falls out until you look like a billiard ball. - On second thoughts, Lieutenant, maybe he's not so lucky because that was found at the crime scene. Next to Sergeant Nelson's dead body. And this other hair was taken from the tug captain's hat, so that's a damn shame. Because if he had lost it all, at least he wouldn't be leaving evidence laying around. - Let me see those. - Why did you kill Nelson? Just trying to tie up all the loose ends? Or were you trying to save a buck by not paying him the rest of his bribe? - Don't say a word. Are you charging him with murder? - This isn't small potatoes, Mr. Fradin. - No. Big potatoes. - Very big potatoes. Unless of course you'd like to cooperate with us. - Tell me what you've got in mind. - He was working with someone. We know who it is, but we need confirmation. And we need his testimony to convict him. - I need some time to discuss this with my client, if you don't mind. - 24 hours. Then we file for Murder One. - That was good, Christine. And it means you can be in Washington tomorrow for the hearings. Washington. - It's too late. - No, get your stuff, get a cab. You could catch the last shuttle. - What about the-- - Go. I'll take care of it. Tell him good luck from me, huh? - [Christine] Right. (upbeat music) - Taxi, taxi! - Hey, we're broken for lunch. Why don't you stay for lunch? - I wouldn't be going back it it weren't so important. - Did you hate everything about the hearings? - I loved your joke. - Were you embarrassed by my beeper going off? - I just hope that you're not gonna wanna play cops and robbers for the rest of your life. (horn honking) - Just a minute. - All right, you go. Do what you have to do, and I'll see you this weekend. - Okay. Think how turned on we'll be by then. It'll be like a honeymoon every weekend. - Yeah. - National Airport please. (light music) (chattering) - Geez, Chris, I didn't mean for you to jump up in the middle of a United States Senate hearing. - We're not taking Lainie Granier here. They were lobbying creampuffs. Confirmation's in the bag. - Listen, Chris, it's not my business, but don't you think you should be there for your husband? - You're right, Mary Beth, it's none of your business. Sorry, but this is what I'm good at, you know, catching the bad guys. And Jimmy understands, he wanted me to come here. He practically pushed me on the plane. Okay? What is this crap about the DA not cutting a deal with Korbutt? - Lieutenant Cagney, more than anything in life, I hate to apologize, but when I'm wrong, I'm wrong. You see, I thought you'd become a nine-to-fiver, and Lacey, I guess I underestimated you as well. The two of you have done one hell of a job on this gun thing, really. - Thank you, sir. - No no no, no, don't thank me, I thank you. I thank both of you. You made me look good. You made us all look good. The DA told me to tell you he wants you both at the press conference. - What about Mansfield? - Read it and weep. (soft dramatic music) - There's nothing they could do, Chris. He fled the country. - I can't believe they didn't pick Mansfield up at the airport. Belarus, who in the hell goes to Belarus? Everybody there wants to come here. - We wouldn't have got a conviction. On the testimony of a co-conspirator, never woulda happened. - Don't try to cheer me up, I wanted Mansfield. I really did. - We got 1,500 automatic weapons off the street. More, if you count that junk in the warehouse. And we got the guy that pulled the trigger. We did good. Isn't that what we used to tell ourselves? Well we did. We did real good. - Then why don't I feel any better? - Chris, there's something I gotta tell you. I don't think I can do this job. - Oh no you don't, don't you give me that crap, Mary Beth. I saw you, you were grinning from ear to ear when you came out of Rashad's pawn shop, and you loved it when you nailed that what's his face with the hair. And to top it off, I need you, so don't you talk to me about quitting because I won't allow it. - I'm not quitting. God knows I could use the paycheck and the medical, but. It's that damn mile run, Christine. I finally qualify with the pistol, I did the rotten situps and the pushups, but I had enough trouble running the mile when I was in shape. I can't do it now, that's all there is to it. - That's it? - Yeah. - No problem. (upbeat music) - [Christine] You gotta pick up the pace. - My shins are killing me. - You can do it. - No, Chris, it's the, it's the rocking chair for me. I just need a little crocheting. - Come on, Mary Beth, do it for me. - Oh. - All right, do it for Harvey. Well then, dammit, do it for yourself. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Okay, we got it going. Okay, go! Go, go, oh, yahoo! Yes, 11 minutes and 53 seconds! Yahoo, all right! - Yes. - No. - Yes. - No. - You. For you, Chris. - What? - You were right the first time. - About what? - I'm doing it for you. (soft music) I owe you, Cagney. You saved Harvey's life. (soft music) I am forever in your debt. (hard breathing) And, you'll just have to learn to live with it. (soft music) Oh my Lord. Oh my Lord, Chris, I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to do the whole thing all over again when they're clocking me. Oh, Chris, Christine. (laughing) Isn't there some kind of an affidavit or something? Something that you could sign that they'd have to believe you? - I will pull you the whole way if I have to. - Yeah, you will, won't you? - Yes. Damn straight. Come on, let's go. Let's go home. - Oh, don't lean on me, Christine. - Sorry. (hard breathing) (light music) - Does that fan help you with the hot flashes? - It's not a hot flash, I'm sweaty from running. - [Mary Beth] I got the name of a good doctor, Christine. She'll give you this Chinese tea that'll even you right out. - [Christine] I don't need any Chinese tea, and I don't need evening right out. - [Mary Beth] Well I'm not convinced that hormones are that good for you, Chris. - [Christine] I don't need hormones. I'm fine. - [Mary Beth] Fine, whatever you say. It's right next door to this great Chinese health food store. They got a tofu mushu. - [Christine] I hate tofu. - [Mary Beth] You can hardly tell the difference. - [Christine] Stop it. (upbeat theme music) (MultiCom Jingle)
