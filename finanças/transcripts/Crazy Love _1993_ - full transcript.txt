Why don't you come to my home for a drink? I am expert in making cock-tail. What's a sunny day, it's wise to watch tapes in my study room. You'd have suggested it earlier. She is hooked! Are you ready? Is the door locked? May I go now? Have you fastened the seat belt? Ok! Hi. Drink something first. Thank you, what's it? I don't know, I just mix some drinks together. Hope it won't be aphrodisiac. No. Are you a model in France? What made you think so? Only model is having such pretty figure. I am sorry. Are you interested in taking films? I know many people in the movie industry. I may introduce them to you. That's great. In fact, I am a doctor. - Really? - Let's go for a screen test! Great! Can you hear my heart beating very fast? Heart beat? I can't hear that! Try to feel it with your hand! My hand? Shit, I forgot my hand is sick. My hand is having no feeling. Only my face and my feet can feel. So, how should I touch it? Use the face. Face? Are you married? Yes, but my wife doesn't understand me. Does she monitor you? My friends call me lady killer. So what do you think? So, you can do anything you want? My wife won't complaint about me. I can do whatever I want. Any more questions? If no, I will user my face to touch your breast softly. Do you know your wife hasn't left? Which wife? Your wife. How do you know she is my wife? The one in yellow dress? Tailing our car. Yellow dress? Tailing our car? You said you are the lady killer. The lady killer has regretted. You said your wife would let you do whatever you want. It's her to do whatever she wants, not me. You'd better leave now! She would cook us and eat us. Hubby! Who is the girl who went into your car? A blind girl. She mistake my car is a taxi. I pitied her, so I gave her a ride. Bye bye, madam. Blind? Do you want me to kill you? Forgive me. I'll beat you to death! Taxi! Oh my car! How can I drive this to earn a living? Bitch, what are you doing with your breast? Why don't you take off your trousers too? John! Didn't you go to uk? Nothing special? Ok, I am leaving now. I decided to go to lantau peak, to stay alone one night. Am I silly to do so? In fact, I just want to face real life. It's not necessary to go to uk. I gave my ticket to Amy's boyfriend. I love Hong Kong. Now, I love loneliness. In fact, I am very happy today. Because I have fooled a wolf. John should be blamed. He's got another girlfriend, and he still wants to cheat me. I hate being cheated. It's not necessary, after tonight. A new day is coming. Hi... What a beautiful girl! Where are you going? She is a Japanese. Come in! Come in! What a pity that we don't know Japanese. That's right. Otherwise, she will be ours. Move now. The skin of the Japanese is so smooth. That tits are not small! Does she know mandarin? Can you speak english? She doesn't know english either. Really? Do you want to try? I am strong. Strong? She said I am strong too. Why don't you do with her? What do you think? He asked me to make love with you. Make love with you? She said she would make love with us. Well, we just wait for her to make love with us. So, what are you waiting for? You said you would make love with me. Want to go? Do you want to go? Great! I surrender. What do you want? You are not Japanese? You acted well. Great! Oh! My dicky! Damn you, won't let me see you again! Hubby, what a lovely scenery! What are you doing? Nothing, nothing... You're lying! Are you sick? Hubby, don't look at it for you are having heart disease. Damn you bitch, you are so cheap! Don't you feel shameful? How can you get changed in the street? You can do it too. But you are afraid you'd scare the passengers to death, right? To face a jinx, that's why you have heart attack. But why don't you show others something nice? Isn't pretty? Once more. Don't look at it. You bitch, you'd better leave now. Otherwise, I would ask for police. You bitch hubby... You had better look at me at home! Am I worse than her? You'd be shit if this is found in front of the police station. The kick was really something! I feel painful from my bladder to kidneys. I heard my sperms shouting her help! There is a car coming. Stop... They don't give a handsome guy a ride. That's right! Higher... That's our car! Yes, yes... Go and take a look. Hey, sir... The car is mine, please don't tow it away. Please don't tow our car, we have suffered a lot. Yes, we suffered a lot. I know it. Pay these tickets. Damn it! Bitch! The 2nd day of this trip has passed without surprise. But until now, not a happy thing has happened. I was almost raped by 2 perverted men. But luckily, they were taught a lesson. There was a bitch. Her husband was so poor to be fooled by me. The bitch scolded me terribly! What a world it is! She wanted to mess up the world! Why can't they live peacefully and happily together? I hope to meet something happy. Hey, it seems to be happened now. Hi. Look. I am hungry, would you treat me chocolate? Alright. Why are you here? I am living next door. But why are you here? Do you know flying? I come from Mars! Mars? Is the girl from Mars love watching others making love? I don't mean it. But you are too concentrated in making love, the noise attracted me. You should be concentrated in making love. Sure... Isn't it exciting to peer others making love? I guessed it was, but in fact, it isn't. It's quite funny, but... I think, making love is more funny. Do you want to do it now? If so, I will teach you some stances. But we don't know each other, it's hard to concentrate. Be frank, don't do it if you don't fall into it. You're right. We fall for each other. I feel you are happy. Have you know each other for a long time? We have known for 3 days. Do you treat all the beauties you know in this way? I love each one whole-heartedly. I enjoy the pleasure which love gives me. I can't stand the love without feeling. So, when I find that the relationship is lacking of feeling, I will look for another affair. When will you stop searching? I don't know, maybe, I can't find any in my life. Are you awake? Do you mind if we do it again? No, I don't mind, go ahead. Woo, let's do it now. Are you leaving? Yes, we want to play over there. Do you come with us? No, I want to take a walk. We are leaving. - Bye bye. - Bye bye. Bye bye. How bad you are to beat me! Don't go! Stop! Miss, this is my stuff. This hat is funny, so I just want to wear it for a while. Are you that mean? Do you come for a vacation? I think so, how about you? I come to write a script. A script? A script for movie? You said you come for a script. But I think you are drawing rather than writing. Does a script writer not being allowed to draw pictures? I am writing a script about woman. But I haven't any idea that, so I draw to kill time. It's nice. Do you know how to sketch? Yes. Do you know how to sketch me? You? I know how to draw a beauty only. Ok, I will draw one picture for you. Look. Can you send it to me? Ok, do you love it? I do. Are you leaving? Yes, I am leaving. - Bye bye. - Bye bye. Why do you follow me? I am following you to your home. What for? You said you are writing a script. So I just want to help. You want to write a script about woman. So I would like to teach you. Go now, I won't rape you. Come in. This is the room in which I write my articles. It is like a warfield. You are man! Why are you that sissy to watch such kind of magazine? So I don't understand the woman's thought. Well, do you know what I am thinking. You are thinking what I am thinking. I am thinking what are we going to eat tonight. I will treat you something great. Come on, help yourself. I am going for a bath. Kidding! You mean hot pot in such hot weather? It seems to be taking sauna bath. But it is easy for me! How about mushroom? Are there any chili sauce? You may get it in the kitchen. Do you love eating chilly? I am in crazy love of it. Chilly is a must in cooking hot-pot, right? - Of course. - I am going to chop some for you. Want some? Enough? Save it for yourself. Great! It's not hot enough. Add some chilly oil. Do you want it? No, I don't want it. Why don't you eat? I am eating. Isn't it not hot enough. Yes... It's not hot enough. Then, the whole pot will be hot. You love hot dish, don't you? Yes, have some. Eat more. Thank you. It's not really hot. What are you laughing? I am all wet, I want to take a bath. Your underwear is cute. Don't touch it. It's clean. Do you have some clean clothes for me? Wait a minute. Here is the clothe. What are you laughing? What are you doing? Why don't you watch the TV but staring at me? Let us play a game. What? Say..."telling the truth" or "taking the risk"? How? Tell the truth, you'd answer anything I am going to ask. If you don't tell the truth, you'd have swollen tongue. If we play the game "taking the risk", you'd do anything I ask you. But I won't ask you to do some abnormal things. - Let me ask you first. - Ok. "Telling the truth" or "taking the risk"? "Telling the truth" how old were you to do that for the first time? What? I mean... Sixteen. Your turn. "Telling the truth" or "taking the risk"? "Telling the truth". Do you love your mate using mouth? I love it. It's your turn. Ok. "Telling the truth" or "taking the risk"? "Taking the risk"? Use the bottle to demonstrate. Satisfied? It's my turn, what do you want? I want "telling the truth". When we met at the first time, did you dream of making love with me? You should tell me the truth. Yes. So what you waiting for? Finished. It's not bad. Can you make it? Ok I won't show you let me look at it, let's see it's ugly or not. - Come on. - It's like you. You mean it's me? Secret attack? You are in deep shit now. Do you still want to escape? Don't go! What is it? Don't come over. Don't come over. - Go to hell. - Don't go! I can't stand it, it's really great. How is it going? Tired! Can't you make it? It's a long way. A car! Let me show you something. It doesn't work. You are not attractive enough. A car is coming, it's my turn. Give me face. - Stop! - Stop! Please give us a ride. Handsome guy, do you want me to take you a ride? Go, otherwise my ass would suffer! Isn't it good? It's nice. I want to buy a pair of sun glasses. Choose some fruits. I will come to you later. Take a look. Miss, your eyes are so beautiful! Such a pair of big glasses doesn't fit you. Really? Why not try this one? How is it? It matches your skin and face, look. How much money? Since you love it, just take it as present. How can it be? It's a fatal acquaintance. Try this, this dress is nice. Take it too. No, it will make your shop close down! You are my friend when you stepped into my shop. Just take it as my regards. Come on, try it. It's pretty. Look, it matches your glasses, it fits your figure. Have you bought the fruit? Such nonsense guy! He sent me sun-glasses and a dress, free of charge. Miss I will wait for you in the karaoke tonight. Ok, it depends. You should come, I am longing to sing a song for you. Bye-bye. I am thirsty! Do you want to go to karaoke? May be. Do you want to go? It depends on my mood. Will you... on the first day you know a boy... And make... What? You know what I mean! If I like him, and if he makes me happy. I think I will do it. Just do as you wish. And do it with all my best. What are you recording? It's just like writing diary. Isn't about me? Your part hasn't been recorded. Who is that guy? You don't know him. You record the man who made love with you. Are you afraid that you couldn't remember all of them? What are you talking about? What do you want? I am not going to talk to you. Are you going to karaoke with this dress? It's nice looking, what's wrong with it? Are you going tonight? I didn't want to go in fact. You drink all the wine. It's boring of not drinking nay wine. Come on, you are the loser, you first. Say, four fours. I can tell you are lying. Ok, I say, 6 fours. I won't believe it. I have one only, unless you have 5 fours. You are not lucky enough, I have 5 fours. Come on, drink it. Jane, it's boring, why don't we leave now? No, I think it's really exciting. Let's go, please! You are always the loser! It's not funny at all. Why don't we go dancing? David, let's go! Come on. That is the bitch who pretended to be a Japanese. Ok, I will teach her a good lesson. Hold it, it's a public place. Our Dickies suffered for a week from her powerful kick! Hey, cause we wanted to rape her. I think it's reasonable for her to kick us. Come on, let's take a seat and watch. Damn! I am thirsty, I want to fetch something to drink first. Ok, come back as soon as possible. Why not leave now? Go home. Please don't! Let's go, the people are weird looking! Why don't you dance with me? I want to dance. Beauty, come on, it's very exciting! Come on. Are you dancing or not? No, why don't we going home? Why do you insist to go home? You'd better go home yourself. Are you bored? How is it? Are you fooled by her too? What are you talking about? See the bitch? She taught us a lesson before. Yes, she charges $3000 once, it's quite expensive. But she is really attractive. It's worth! Boss, but she costs $3000 each. She knows every kinds of skill. She can give you excellent fun! That's right, she won't be tired even you do three times with her. It's really worth! What are you talking about? You idiot! Go pissing! Pissing. Let's go together. Can you find your girlfriend? Why don't you drink with me? I can easily get drunk. So don't drink it, auntie. Damn it. You are bad. I am not. I just want to take you to watch laser disc. How is it? I don't love it. Why not? It's funny. My hi-fi is excellent. Are you coming? Come on. Please don't! Let's go to my place. No, I want to go home, bye-bye. Didn't you go with that guy? Listen to me, ok? $3000 is too much for me. I can't afford it! What do you mean? Are you still pretending to be decent? It's nonsense to tell the truth. So, are you asking me to leave now? Damn it, it's shit. I am dirtied. Wait for me, I will soon be alright. I am going to be alright. Don't go, I am going to be alright. It's better now. I miss you all night. Just come in. Have you drunk a lot. Don't you missing me? I am not that kind of person which you have in mind. Did you sleep with that guy last night? Yes. Did you... Yes. If you don't want to know it, don't ask. Do you want me to tell lies? I think I could find someone to substitute you. But now, I know that, I am really fond of you. If you do, then we can live happily together. But I don't even know who you are. I don't know you very well too. I only know that, I do love you. I told you the truth. I feel happy to stay with you. Why do you like me? I like to see you act like a kid when you are in bad temper. Touch yourself in the way I touched you. Did I touch you in this way? Did your clients ask you to do so? What client? The client who pays you for sex. I thought I have found one whom I am fond of, but I can't tell it'll be over that soon. I feel happy with David. He is like a kid. But he becomes a man in bed. I think I am really fond of him. Should I go back for David? But, he insulted me. Ok, so what? There is need, so there is hooker. One calls for hooker, and despises the hooker. Damn you bastard! Go, there is no room rented in hour basis. Go! Give me the most expensive room, please! Do you understand what is most expensive? I do, I do. Please go to the room 228. I will come to register for you. Let me take the luggage for you. It's quite old and broken, I'd better take it myself. Sir, is this seat empty? No, please take a seat. Snowball, please. Ok, miss. Are you alone? I am called lonely. What a funny name. May I buy you a drink? I have made the order. You can just pay it. Yeah... Are you a woman? Where do you come from? Somewhere. Then, where is it? It doesn't matter to know where. Just as you like. So care free! Are you coming alone? Yes, I come for a vacation alone. Miss, your snowball. Thank you. Are you feeling hot? I feel hot too. Is my dress pretty? It's pretty. Are you thinking that it would be more beautiful if I am nude, right? Do you want to take a look? Here? If they don't mind, I don't mind too. I do. Why not go to the room? How much do you charge? If you do that well... I won't charge. Big deal! Shit, it's very cheap. You are easily to be courted. Sir, help me please, he wants to rape me. I am only sixteen. Pal, don't listen to her bull shit. She asked me to do with her. You wolf, I want to teach you a lesson. Miss, don't panic, I will protect you. Damn you, do you want to go to hell? The man are rude! Do you wanna go? I am a hero against hooker! Do you want to fool me? Lie down, do you want to go? Never! Undress now! Do you want to make a call? Stop dreaming! Unless you treat me comfortably. Then I will give you 200 extra. Let's listen a song first. Other than money, atmosphere is important too. Why not dance together? Ok. Stop dancing, or I can't make it anymore. Come on, let's go to bed. Someone is coming. Miss, what is the matter? Wait. Honey, we have used up the condoms. I want to buy some from the store. Bye bye. Send three bottles of champagne to us please. Damn it! It's full of blood. Hi, miss beauty. The fatty said I didn't suit him. He told me to ask you to go up. This is the key of his room. Plus one thousand dollars. He said, he would give you one thousand more after that. Really? What an advantage! I didn't order the champagne. The girl ordered it. So, you should charge the girl. Take it away. You are naughty! You ordered the champagne in advance! Just put it here. Get out please. In fact, I like you. Out of my expectation. I have extra money. You are not bad. Come on, don't waste any time. I am so long for you I haven't been satisfied for a long time. Abalone from deep sea! Hey, Mr. kwan where is Susan? Who is Susan? The one who stayed with you in the beach. She was courted by an ugly man with a beautiful yacht. I am sorry, please don't be upset. Why should 1? At least we were happy. There are so many girls left, why should I be upset? Have you found your ideal boyfriend? We have broken up. Why? Why you have separate? He is an idiot! Do you love that idiot? I do, but... So, that's it! But... But what? Most important of all, you are in love with him. You are big enough, go to him if you like him. Don't let him wait for you and you shouldn't wait for him. It's a waste of time, right? So just stay together happily! That's right! Ok, bye-bye. Bye-bye. Hey. If one day you remember me again, come to visit me. I am waiting for this chance. Ok? Let's see. - Bye bye. - Bye miss, it's bored to walk alone. May I accompany you? Alright. You're tired, let's find some place to take a rest? - Who are you looking for? - Hi. I am Jane, where is David? David? Miss, who are you? I am Jane. Where is David? You said you know David, but does David know you? Who are you? I am his fiancée. I think he may know me. Fiancee? Where is his room? It's over there. But he is busy now. Really? Let me go and take a look. Miss, he is busy now. I am doing the massage for her only. Just go on. Who is she? Would you wait for me outside? Take your time, I will wait for you. Who is she? Tell me. Brother fatty, are you the cook tonight? Yes, I have told you he is busy! What is it, curry chicken? Don't add so many onion. I dislike it! Do you know how to chop it? Let me teach you. Who is that girl? Betty! Have they know each other for a long time? Well, just a few days what's wrong with you? You are so careless. Don't be angry with David, he is always like this! What's up? What's wrong with you? It's normal reaction of a youth. You always think of her, you don't love me at all. I am not a substitute. Are you still waiting for me? What? You fixed it quickly! I won't, you know it. Sorry for bothering you. I have been waiting for you for ages. I think you are not coming. Betty is accompanying you, you won't be bored. I am not serious to her. But I am serious to you. Isn't one enough? It depends on, if it's good, one is enough. Just eat in your room. I want to eat alone. Where did you court her? I want to try my luck. Finally, I know what is the real love of the 90's. Mr. kwan is right. Just two of you are in love. You should stay happily together. Most important of all... You know the other half is really in love with you. So you don't have to be mean. May be you don't agree with me. But, I still want to say. Mr. kwan is right, do as you like.
