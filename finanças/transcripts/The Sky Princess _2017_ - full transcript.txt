[elder Mosi] Have you ever wondered why the sun and the moon never shine in the sky together? Long ago, they were husband and wife. Their love lit up the sky like never before. But, But the moon became jealous of the attention the sun gave to the universe. She was so heartbroken that she wanted nothing to do with him. Kisiwa Island was split into the Sun Village and the Moon Kingdom. Plants could not grow without the sun. To stop the hunger, the moon sent animals. But the people were still depressed without the sun. So she lavished them with diamonds, rubies and lots of gold! Everybody lived by the monarchy's number one rule: par-tay! Meanwhile, on the other side of the island... The land was fertile. But without the moon, people worked non-stop. A council of wise elders lead the village. Both sides of the island were like different planets until one girl changed the sky as we know it... [mama] I gotta take Grandma to the doctor, help Aunt Imani plan her baby shower, and stop by the market... You mind watching Kojo and Ayo? -[Kojo] Gimme! -[Ayo] Gimme! [Dafina] Do I have a choice? Dafina, when I was your age, I had to look after seven younger brothers. I know, Mama. But... why do girls always have to baby-sit? That's the way it was for me, your grandmother, your great-grand-- -[Ayo farts] -[Kojo cries] [laughs] Come here, Little Miss Stinky. It's okay. I'll change her. Thanks, sweetheart. [slurps] [Kojo] Yummy! Yummy! [Ayo] Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! [Kojo and Aya laugh] [sighs] [baba] Good morning, my children! [Omari] What's up! Hey, Baba. Hey, Omari. Mama made grits. Mmmm! No time for breakfast today. Aww! We're starting a very important project. Oh! The princess stool? Wow! Remember, who it's for is never as important as what it's for. [Kojo and Ayo laughs] [babytalk] Will I be surprised with a princess stool for my birthday tomorrow?

What do you want, Mosi? Happy birthday, Dafina! Go 'head, it's your birthday. Go 'head, it's your birthday. [laughs] Thanks for remembering. What kind of guy forgets his future wife's birthday? Let's not get carried away. -[Kojo] Gimme, gimme. -[Ayo] Gimme, gimme. The nerve of you to eat my birthday gift! No, I... ouch! [kids laugh] I thought it might be romantic to peel you some fruit, who knew love could be so painful. [kids laugh harder] Friends have no business being romantic. We could be much more than friends. You never know when to quit. [chewing loudly] But I know what women want. Oh really? A guy who makes them laugh till their stomach hurts. Or maybe that's gas? [laughs] Know the one about the cheetah and the giraffe? [laughs] [Dafina] You've told that joke twenty-eight times, -but who's counting-- -It was a very, very hot day. And the cheetah went under the biggest tree for some shade. Along comes the giraffe who says, "Hey, you took my spots." [crickets chirp] Get it? They both have... [children giggle] [chuckles] Maybe that joke is for a younger crowd. Don't worry, I'll get you more fruit tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that, till we're so old that our teeth fall out and we can't eat fruit anymore. [Mosi pretends to be toothless] Ugh! That's gross, but kinda sweet too. [kissing sound] [Kojo and Ayo] Oooh. Thank you so much for cooking my favorite. I had to make veggie stew for my birthday girl. You didn't forget? Girl, I was in labor with you for twenty-two hours! Um! I remember every second of it. When the midwife put you in my arms and you smiled at me, I thought you were the most precious thing under the sun. [baba] Happy birthday, Dafina! Your father and I wanted to give you something as special and unique as you are. Wow! It's really pretty! These eighteen beads represent each year of your life. Let everything you've learned be a foundation for wisdom. Thank you so much, Mama and Baba. [Nubia] Hey girl, what'd you get for your birthday? My father made this for me. [Sizani] I guess that's cute, if you like that sort of thing, but girl, look what my daddy bought me for my birthday! [laughs proudly] Quit showing off, Sizani. You know her family can't afford gold. Um. Oh, my bad. Besides, the only gift that counts is the one from your boyfriend, right? Check this out. See what my man got me for my birthday! 'Ey, we saw Mosi walking around with a lil' fruit basket yesterday. Is that all he gave you? [cheetah laughs] Mosi is not my man. [giggles smugly] Don't be ashamed, Dafina. Some girls get diamonds, [clears throat] And some girls get corny guys with corny jokes. Nubia, I told you, he's not my ma-- [Nubia] Hm. [Sizani] Bye Dafina! Come on, girl, let's go to the market. I need new sandals in the worst way. Ouch! [monkey laughs] Girl, what's the matter? That's exactly what Mosi gave you. [laughs wickedly] He even kinda looks like Mosi. [cheetah mouth farts] [Sizani] Aw, look at him! Mosi! [Dafina cries] What's wrong, sweetheart? Other girls go shopping and all I do is baby-sit. And I know Baba says it's wrong to want gold and diamonds, but why? If you're not satisfied with who you are, a shiny rock won't change anything. I'm worried about Dafina. [chuckles] You always worry about the children. Usually all four of them, at the same time. This is different. Dafina is changing. I know she's not our little girl anymore, but why are you worried? She's curious about gold and diamonds. Plant a seed and you can eat the crop. Plant a diamond and nothing grows. Yeah, but... maybe if we bought something small for Dafina ...like a pair gold earrings, then she could see that it's not a big deal. Here in the Sun Village... our soil, our plants, our whole way of life is worth more than all of the diamonds in the Moon Kingdom. One minute, Baba. Take your time, son. You're not going anywhere today. Huh? You will stay home and help your mother... Dafina, you will come with me. This place is so beautiful, Baba. The real beauty is how everything here has a purpose. Trees make the air we breathe. Without them, there is no life. And this one is eight-hundred years old. Wow! [magical transformation] Actually, I'm eight-hundred and sixteen, but I think I look pretty good for my age. Huh? Whoa! Uh! [falls] Ebony, this is my daughter, Dafina. [magical transformation] [tree whistles] Mm. Mmm. Mmmm! My, my, my! [kisses] Watch yourself or you might end up being firewood. My bad, but your daughter is fine. [magical transformation] Baobob is such a flirt. He acts like that with all the trees. [magical transformation] Man please, you know you ain't got no game. Do all of you...talk? We're always talking, but most folks don't care to listen, except for your father, he's a good man. Good man, my twig! He chops us up into pieces for a living. But he always talks to us first and he only takes what he needs. Other folks cut us down without a thought or a care. If some fool lays one finger on my bark, I've got something for 'em! Back up off me! I said back up off me! [karate sounds] I meant to do that. (hurt) Oh! [laughs] This is all I need today. 'Ey man, that's gonna cost you ten cowry shells. Will that be credit or debit? Aw, shut your trunk, Baobab. I promise to put this to good use. Take care, everybody. You do the same. See ya later! Don't leave a brotha hangin'. I was hoping we could grab dinner sometime. You like mud pot pies? I always stress that everything has a purpose. As you make the journey into womanhood, your mother and I feel it's important for you to embrace that sense of purpose. Yeah! I guess I am a woman now that I'm eighteen. Whoa-oh! Not so fast, young lady. Look around you, everything here has a purpose. Dancers wear this mask to honor the ancestors. Midwives wash newborn babies in this bowl. And this will make a staff for the lead council elder. Baba, is that the princess stool? Can I sit in it? Please... Like I told you, everything has a purpose. That was not made for you. This was. [leaves falling] [wood carving] Ouch! When I first learned, this happened to me a lot. But accidents and mistakes are the key to getting better. Someday, these will be the hands of a great carver. [upbeat music] [babytalk] I had so much fun today! Not as much fun as we did! (laughs) [babies laugh] So much for traditions, 'ey? [laughs] Elder Femi will appreciate your hard work. Baba! Why do we make all this nice stuff for other people but we never get to keep anything for ourselves? -You know that everything... -Has a purpose... I'll get our lunch on the way back. [instrumental music] [instrument] I am Princess Dafina. Ruler of a mighty nation! (laughs) Princess Dafina... [Tamu] It's my honor to serve you, Princess Dafina. [screams] Who said that? What have you done!? I am so sorry, I just... You disappoint me, Dafina. [babytalk] Ready to boogie across the river? Um, I'll have to pass. Come on, girl! Mosi, I'm grounded. And even if I wasn't, Baba would never let me go to a Moon Kingdom party. But I'm sure you'll have fun. Fun without you is like the sky without the sun. [snoring] [Tamu] Dafina. Dafina. Mosi, um... tell me about the party later. DAFINA! What? [gasps] It's my honor to serve you, Princess Dafina. Who-- what are you? I am Tamu, your loyal subject. Huh? When you sat on the royal stool, you became a princess. It was you.. you spoke to me in the forest... And now, I'll take you to your palace. [giggles] What? [yawns] What are you doing? Ah...um...ah...bird watching. Mama, do you think I could be a princess? You will be a queen in your own right when you learn to appreciate what you have. Um? [snaps green peas] But every girl dreams of being a princess. I was always content just being me. It figures you would say that, Mama! [record stopping] Until you learn your lesson, you'll stay grounded. Oooh! Oooh! Hey girl! Why was your man at the party without you? Um Mosi is not my man. She probably didn't have anything else to wear. Is that the only dress you got? [cheetah laughing] Listen, what I've got is none of your business! Whatever. Oh girl, let's go. I'm running late for my hair appointment. [monkey laughs] [Tamu kicks the banana] Huh? [laughs] Thanks. My pleasure, your highness. Are you real or am I going crazy? You are real! Are you ready to go to your palace, Princess Dafina? Sure. [giggles] But what about my family? Unfortunately, you'll have to leave them behind. But just say the word, and I'll bring you home. You can be princess for a day, a week, a month, a year... Are you some kind of genie? A genie can only grant you three wishes. I can grant ya thousands. Wait a minute... What's the catch? Well... What is it? You can only be a princess in the Moon Kingdom. What's wrong with that? It's quite different from the Sun Village. I've been waiting my whole life for different. Let's go! Hold on tight! Whoa! Wow! Whoa! Look out! [giggles] Whoa. This is amazing. The amazing part is yet to come, your highness. [magical transformation] Wow! Right this way, Princess Dafina. I see you're not the only one. Does that make me any less special? You're more than special, you made me a princess. Tamu. Don't they know I'm not a real princess? Nonsense!

[giggles] Oh dear, That's just one of your many birthday presents. We'll be celebrating all month. Perhaps we can convince your father to buy the diamond statue you so deserve. [door opens] Do you know who made this? Who knows and who cares? Let's eat! Thanks. Excuse me, but um.. are there any vegetables? [laughs] Now that's a good one, a kid asking for vegetables... A proper princess never plays with her food. [chews] Not bad. This would be nice with some veggie stew. You know we only serve meat in this palace. Have you been sneaking over to the Sun Village? Me, oh, me, no! But a friend of a friend said veggie stew is pretty tasty. Oh dear, I hope you're not consorting with those Sun kids. Give her a break, we'll have to make peace with the sunny side of the island some day. Guess what? I wanna throw a party for my little princess. Oh, really? But why? Because it's your birthday month. You can pick out everything, even the menu. I want okra, and yams, and rice, oh and uh, could you throw in some collard greens too? Mmm! Mmm! Go to the Sun Village and get all the ingredients for a vegetarian feast! Feast! Feast! [hums] Dafina! How did you like being princess for a day? It's amazing... but I kinda miss my real family, especially Mama's cooking. Are you ready to go home? It would be kinda rude to leave now, The king is throwing me a party. I've never been to a... Par-tay! Par-tay! Par-tay! Whoa! [laughs] You remind me of someone. Is he handsome like me? I guess he's handsome in his own way. Aaahhh... I see. No, it's not like that. Mosi is just a friend... I wonder if he would even recognize me. I know Nubia and Sizani would be so jealous. If seeing others jealous makes you happy, I can grant that wish too. Nah Being a princess is more than enough. [footsteps] There is no sign of Dafina. I asked everyone in the village. Nobody knows where she is. I pray nothing bad has happened to her. [African music] Flawless diamonds for a flawless princess. Thank you, Moon Queen. To this entire kingdom, I am royalty, but my most important title will always be mother. Thank you...ah...Mama. You're so welcome, sweetie. [kisses] [background chatter] I can't thank you enough, Moon King. I mean, thanks Baba. Only the best for my sweet princess. Well, this really turned out to be a top-notch affair. And I can't get enough of these collard greens with hot sauce. Mm, mmm, mmmm! [giggles] [applause] My magic is compliments of Prince Ekene. What should I do? What should I say? How's my hair? Oh, you are perfectly lovely, dear. Just be yourself. Sweetheart, don't fall for that ole' sky magic. Men do that all the time when they want to...[hiccups] Good evening, Moonking, Moonqueen, and Princess Dafina. Can I please have this dance? [zap] Stop right there, pretty boy. Darling, isn't this supposed to be Dafina's night? [sighs] Alright. But just one dance. [kisses] [trumpets playing] I was afraid to even talk to you. Why? Because of the Moon King? Because of your beauty. Your eyes shine like a million stars, your lips are as soft as... [faints] I've never been much of a dancer. Hey, you still owe me a dance. -But I... -If everything works out, we'll have our whole lives to dance together. Whoa! Our whole lives! You mean... I doubt your father approves of me, the poorest prince in the Moon Kingdom. My palace has only fifteen bedrooms. But I could build an addition... My parents taught me that the size of a hut... I mean a palace, doesn't matter as much as the love inside. Then maybe I can convince the king that I'm worthy of your hand. I realize we just met, but what I feel goes deeper than love at first sight. Princess Dafina, I want to marry you. [dreams] Princess Dafina, I want to marry you. Psst. Princess Dafina! [yawns] Hey, Tamu. Did you shake a tail feather? Um. Um. Um! [giggles] No. But tonight was perfect. The perfect food, the perfect music, the perfect prince. Does that mean you don't want to go home? Life here is amazing, but I can't stay. I'm gonna tell Prince Ekene the truth, then he can meet my real family, and we can all move into his palace. He's got fifteen bedrooms, you know. Impressive. None of this would've happened without you. You're like family! Tamu, I want you to live with us. It would be my honor, Princess Dafina. [instrument] Ouch! I am so sorry, your highness. You're fired, you incompetent peasant Sun girl! Moon Queen, I mean Mama, she made an honest mistake. [door opens] I said, be gone! [flames] [seamstress cries] You didn't have to do that. She gave me no choice. You just can't reason with those people. But what do you mean when you say "those people." The Sun Village is full of hopeless souls who spend their miserable little lives wanting what we have. Not all of them... In time, you'll see the truth for yourself. [ocean waves] [fireworks] Wow. All of this for me? I wanna give you much more. [kiss] Are you always this romantic? I'm just getting warmed up. So tell me, Prince Ekene... Yes, Princess Dafina? What's your favorite joke? I really don't have one. Ever hear the one about the cheetah and the giraffe? It was a hot day and the cheetah went under the tree, or was it the bush? No, the cheetah went under the tree... -and-- -Wait, is that a Sun Village joke? You got something against Sun people? What if I told you that I was really a wood carver's daughter... from the Sun Village? [laughs] [flames crackle] -I really don't care what side of the island you're from. -You don't? You're so sweet and beautiful. I couldn't imagine life without you. So... you would still marry me, even if I was a Sun girl? Me? Marry a Sun girl? [laughs] No. But you'd make a great concubine. What!? [trumpet blues] [band music] [coughing] That's one angry Sun woman. [band music continues] [bass music] We're looking for our daughter. [chime] Hmm, you mean that -good-for-nothing seamstress that I fired? -What? There is no Sun girl here. Now get off this property at once! [flames crackle] [footsteps] [music beat increases] [gasps] Let go of me! Let go of me! [punch] [stars] Oh! Mommy! [heavy breathing] What? No! Leave them alone! [heavy breathing] Mama! Baba! I missed you so much. Can you please help us find our daughter? Mama, Baba... It's me! She's not here. I think we should go. [cries] Wait! Mama...Baba... Please! Has anyone seen our daughter? [crying] How could Mama and Baba not know me? Tamu! Tamu! I hope you can hear me. [flute] [bracelet clinks] I'm ready to go home! I feel like I've lost everything that matters. You've still got me. Thank God. Let's get out of here. Absolutely, your highness. Uh-uh. I'm done being a princess. My own parents didn't know me! That's because you called the moon queen and the moon king "Mama" and "Baba." I know. I never should've done that. Look, Tamu... I just want to go home to my real family. Are you sure? [chimes] [xylophone crescendo] [magical sounds] If you don't mind, I really need to check in with the "Mrs." Oh, okay. I never knew you were married. Ife means everything to me. She really makes my home a nest. [chuckles] I'd love to meet her. [magical sounds] Oh! We're a long way up. [sniffs] Mmm, smells like fried crickets. [gags] Yuck! Hey honey, I hope you cooked enough for one more. No! Oh, it's okay. I'm not hungry. [chuckles] [grasshoppers hop] Dafina, meet my wife, Ife. Yo Ife, say "what's up" to my new wifey, Dafina. Say what? No! Ugh! Aw! [crashes] It was rude to leave in the middle of dinner like that. You can't do this to me! And why are you talking like that? I guess you can say this is the real me. Take me back home like you promised! You are home. Come on, ma, admit it, you wanna be my wifey. [Tamu mocking Dafina] "Tamu, you made all my dreams come true. Tamu, you're like family.

I'm in the mood for some mealworm cheesecake. Don't worry, love, I'll be back before you can say larvae. [kisses] [chime] [Dafina sighs] [Dafina sobbing] -Huh? -It's... chicken soup. Thank you. [slurps] Don't tell me... he promised to make you a princess with his magic and his fake British accent. I never should've left home. I made that same mistake... five years ago. [chime] No. Uh-uh. Definitely not! I asked for an exact replica of the princess dress! That's impossible. The royal family uses a special fabric that nobody can buy. Mother, you disappoint me. I'm sure the queen never disappoints her daughter. If your father was still alive, he would-- This isn't about him. It's about you not giving me what I want! Ife... I can't make you a princess. [mocking mother] "Ife, I can't make you a princess." Well, why not? A face this beautiful... belongs in a palace. -[Tamu] I agree, Princess Ife. -[Ife screams] [Ife] I thought I was hearing voices until the night he appeared. -[Paparazzi 1] Princess Ife! -[Paparazzi 2] Over here! Psst! [Ife] I also realized that I had been a spoiled you-know-what, that I had been living the life of a princess all along, -except for the Paparazzi. -Huh? [Paparazzi laughing] [Ife] I begged Tamu to bring me home. [descending xylophone scale] [magical music] But he brought me here, to Daybreak Mountain. His first wife, Zalika, told me the truth about him. People like Tamu, they give away their humanity for riches or magic powers. He used a spell to make me believe I was a princess, but I had been captive on this mountain the whole time. He did the same thing to you. That does not make sense. I was at the Moon Palace, I was there! No... Tamu brought you here... a year ago. You never stepped foot in the Moon Palace. You never met the Moon Queen or the Moon King. -You ne-- -No! I begged Tamu to let you go, but... Uh-uh! I gotta get out of here! Please, stop! I don't want you to end up like Zalika. What happened to her? One day, she tried to escape and she fell. There's no way to make it off this mountain alive. Ew! Here, you try it! -[grasshopper hops] -Ugh! Oh, that's nothing compared to the stink beetle stew. Uughh! I'd do anything to get back home. I miss my family so much. I miss my boyfriend too... [chuckles] even his corny jokes. Sounds like a lot of people love you. I really miss my mother. I may never see her again, but if I make it to heaven-- Uh-uh. Don't give up on getting out of here. Dafina, trust me, we're stuck here. Hmm, not if we spice these up with a little poison. Tamu bought everything in this kitchen. So what's the plan? Honey, when you go to the market, pick up some ginger, some cinnamon... oh, and some poison too. Oh trust me... there's another way. -[grasshopper] Oh no! -[Ife] Is that poisonous? Uh-uh. How about that one? I guess not. [suspenseful music] [Dafina breathing heavily] [suspenseful music crescendo] [Dafina gasps] [breathing heavily] It's so beautiful. Are you sure it's this one? Oh yeah. Pretty things can do the most damage. And that's exactly what Tamu is gonna find out tonight. [dramatic music] [slurps] [exhales and clears throat] That's it... A wife should always respond to her husband's needs. By the way, how you two getting along? Oh, great! [giggles] Wonderful! [giggles] Has Dafina been helping around the kitchen? Ife is teaching me everything you like. Two beautiful wives cooking my favorite meals. I'm one lucky man. Huh, I mean... [swallows] bird. I mean... [chuckles] you know. [Dafina and Ife laugh awkwardly] [Tamu crunching] Hm, the recipe's a little off. [magical music] [band music] [Tamu chewing] Mm. Mmm. Mmmm! [crash] [coughs] I'm in so much pain. [coughing] My whole body hurts... from my feathers... to my... [coughs] Ah, maybe you'll feel better in the morning. It's too late for me. [coughing] Is he? [gasps] We did it! [laughs] You got what you deserve... -you triflin' ol-- -[Tamu coughing] -[screams] -[coughing and laughing] No! Ugh! [Tamu laughing] [Tamu sighs] It's gonna take more than berry poison to get rid of yours truly! By the way, how was my acting? [funny noises] [Ife] Dafina, no! I can't stay here! But it's too dangerous to-- [Tamu] Play time is over, girls! [Dafina] Ugh! [cries] No! [sighs] I'm okay! [suspenseful music] [feathers ruffle] -[Dafina] No! Ugh! -[Tamu grunts] [both grunt in struggle] [Dafina] No! [sobbing] [crash] [magical music] We've been waiting for you, girl. I'm Marula, and this is my twin brother, Adisa. So, what's up? Ah! Wait... is this heaven? Naw, but we can take ya higher, Sista Dafina. You know me? Mm-hm, you're Ebony's home girl. I owe my life to both of you. Thanks so much for saving me. We're happy to help. Listen, I... I um... Out with it. The squeaky wheel gets oil. A watched pot never boils. A half loaf is better than no bread, and I said-- In other words, speak your mind, girl. Ah, I really need one more big favor. Whatever it is, we got you. Ife... jump! [Ife breathing heavily] I can't! Ife, trust yourself! [sighs] Thank you! -Oh! -[clangs] [dramatic music] No, I got this. [both grunt in struggle] [Tamu cries] [xylophone descending scale] [wind whirling] Thanks so much! [Ife] If I said thank you a million times, that would never be enough. [chime] Tell Ebony we say "hi." And tell Baobob I said "what's up?" [joyful music] Promise this is not goodbye. I'll see you again, Ife, trust me. [happy music] It's been two years since we've seen Dafina. I think about her every day. Yeah, I really miss her too. I just wish we could see her one more time. Dafina! Dafina! -Hey! -[footsteps] [happy music] [kisses] I'm so sorry for what I did. I never should've left. I worried about you all the time. We were afraid that you were gone forever. Oh! I was afraid too. [piano music] I had everything I could ever want, except the most important thing. I found out... that nothing can replace the people you love. But when I wanted to come home, I walked right into a nightmare. Thinking of all of you kept me strong. And my friend, Ife, she kept me sane. I knew I'd be back where I belong one day. I'm real sorry that you had to go through all of that. I wish I could've been there to protect you. Oh, Baba... you taught me that everything has a purpose. And what happened... Well, that only made me more grateful to finally be home. We love you so much, Dafina! And I love all of you! [laughs] Hey... you two are getting heavy. [kids laughing] [Dafina humming] Hey, Dafina! [light drumming music] It's real good to have you home. Oh, Mosi! I missed you so much! Seeing your face again... makes me feel-- -What? -Aren't you gonna tell me... "Let's not get carried away." You'll never hear me say that again. After everything I've been through, I know what really matters. Mosi, I... I love-- Hey! How are you, young man. Oh, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm good, I'm good, sir. [giggles] I'll go get us some water so... you guys can talk. [whispers] I think Mosi wants to ask you something... [footsteps] Now I understand why you're so nervous. Mosi, have you come to ask for my daughter's hand in marriage? [bong] [water gently rushing] Oh! I want gold lipstick and weave all the way down to my... -[giggles] -Hey girl! Are you gonna congratulate Nubia on getting engaged to Mosi? Girl, did you see that ring? [chuckles] Mosi would never marry you. And didn't you call him corny? Yeah, I only said that around you. I had my eye on Mosi all along. When you left, it was easy to make him mine. Mm-hm. Bam! Boom! Bling! [chime] [suspenseful music] Where is Mosi? [wood carving] Mosi just left. He told me that he's engaged, but... Dafina, please wait! Oh! Dafina. How could you marry Nubia? I always wanted to be with you. But after you left... I thought I'd never see you again. I'm so sorry. DAFINA: Do you love her? I made a promise to her. You can't go through with this. My father says that a real man never goes back on his word. But Mosi, if you don't love her, it makes no sense to marry her. [kisses] [somber music] Maybe it will one day. Sorry... but I gotta go, Dafina. ♪ Girl, if you're feeling blue ♪ ♪ I will make you feel like new ♪ Uh-uh. ♪ Yeah ♪ [muffled] Back up off me! Back up off me! Mama, listen, I love Mosi. And I know he loves me. I know it! I just don't understand why-- As much as it hurts, you have to make peace with it. You don't want to be in love with another woman's husband. Oh! Somebody's outside to see you. Is it Mosi? I think she's a Moon girl. Oh, and she's fine too. -[Dafina giggles] Hey, girl! -[Ife] Hey! All my life, I was told to never come here. But this is such a beautiful place. There are trees everywhere and I [laughs] I can't get over how good the sun feels on my skin. And the best thing about the Sun Village... is our food! You have to stay for dinner. I don't want to impose. [chuckes] Girl, please. [laughs] Alright, I'll stay. But on one condition... Please come to my house for dinner. [Dafina] Sure! [happy music] [chews] Mmm! Mmm! [car breaks screeching] [Ife] Oh! I am so glad you're here. [Dafina] Me too, girl. All I can say is "wow!" [Ife] Mama! This is Dafina! I can not thank you enough for helping my daughter. We helped each other. I never would've survived without Ife. [chews] Mmm! [chuckles] [uplifting music] Please sit down, Mama. I got it. Your father would be so proud of you. Is that the real Moon palace? I used to dream about going there. Now... [chuckles] being home feels like a dream come true. [laughs] Mm-hm. I heard that! [Dafina sobs] [sad music] Oh, Dafina. Oh look at you. I'm not going. You should be there for him. [upbeat drumming] I just can't. Those stupid drums are giving me a headache. Stupid wedding. Stupid... Ouch! [drums continue] [sighs] -Ow! -[Monkey laughs] [Baobab tree] My bad [laughs] but that was kinda funny. [Baobab muffled] Back up off me! Back up off me! Aw, shut your trunk, Baobob. Is something wrong? Naw, except the guy I love... is about to marry the girl I hate. [Ebony] Reminds me of my first love. We had a misunderstanding and... he proposed to another tree. What did you do? Nothing. He married her and went on to have a dozen saplings. [bong] [chime] Your story made me feel a million times better. Girl, quit moping and go get your man!

I love everything about you, even your cheetah and giraffe joke, especially that. I just... I hope it's not too late for us to be together. Dafina, that's all I needed to hear. I'm so sorry... but... I can't marry you. Now, where were we? [kiss] Skert! I don't think so. I'll see your sorry behind in court. Oops! Yeah! [people chatting] It's not fair! Do you know how much my parents spent on food and flowers? Not to mention my hair? [horse neighs] I promise to pay them back. Just keep your promise to me. We can still get married! Alright, alright, we've heard enough. Are we ready to make a decision? [elder man snores] I say that Mosi should marry Nubia. If Mosi doesn't want to marry her, why force him? They'll be miserable together. [elder man yawns] I think that... Mookie should get married... [kisses] [record stopping screech] But I'm in love with someone else. And by the way, my name is Mosi. Let's see how good you are with names after your 99th birthday. The point is that it's time to take your wife. [elder man snores] That's two-to-one! The elder council has spoken. [harp music] [elder man] Ow! [elder woman laughs] [elder woman shreaks] No! Marry the girl who made this for me. -Ugh! -Hey girl, forget about Mosi. I'm single! [harp music] If you want... we can do the ceremony right now. I pronounce you... husband and wife. I'm sure you know what to do next. [applause] [kids] Ooohh! [happy music] [harp music] [chimes] [kiss] [narrator] Well, after the sun and moon made up they decided to share both sides of Kisiwa Island. And that was the beginning of day and night as we know it. Oh, because you kissed Grandma! It was a kiss to remember. -Ah! -Actually, Ife and I helped the Sun Village and the Moon Kingdom reach a peace treaty. What's a pee treaty? Oh! [laughs] A peace treaty is an understanding between people. Oh, it took many years... But things got better between Sun folks and Moon folks. And when our son married Ife's daughter, all of you were like the honey on the yams. Grandma, did you ever want to be a rich princess again? You know, like you used to be? This land, this life... and you grandchildren... Why you're my greatest riches. If you have love, [laughs] you have everything. Grandma, please tell us another story. Oh now, it's getting kinda late, sweetheart. Aw... But, I think we have time for a joke. [children laugh] -Now, Mosi... -[child yawns] Grandpa, it's almost bedtime! Um, let's see... if I can remember how it goes. [children] Oh! Don't tell me... is this the one about the cheetah and the giraffe? [everyone laughing] [chimes] [happy music] [chimes]
