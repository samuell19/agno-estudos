Smith yes sir i never saw a rookie take to navy routine like Smith just like an old he's going for gunners mate sir i hope you make it Smith thank you sir i'm going to try that's the spirit most of you will be assigned to duty on minesweepers you will find the work difficult dying and at times dangerous the continual sweeping of the channels may appear dull and monotonous at times you may wish that you were serving at sea in a more colorful and active branch of the navy but remember this the lives of the ships and the men who go out through these harbors to battle our enemies depend on you you are the men who keep them sailing good luck good work probably more where that came from mr well undoubtedly we'll get them you know for rookie you're a little short of terrific that coming from you is a real compliment it took me a year to get where you got in a month you're referring to the navy or uh oh i'm not taking a backseat for anybody no i'm sort of a handy lad myself sure it's guys like you that make it tough for guys like me another inch around that which you have to throw that bell away i guess you're right between mom's cooking in that navy chow they're about to play ned with my streamlined fingers yeah they sure are uh mom's having corned beef and cabbage tonight as you can drop around yeah I don't think so i uh by the way mary was asking about you she was tell mama I'll be on deck then that's what i thought oh you guys wouldn't know a good joke when you heard one no mr corn but we're learning learning very fast speaking of corn that reminds me tennessee mom's having her favorite dish tonight corned beef and cabbage did she raise it with a knife and a fork oh i'm sharp as a marble had an announcement or an invitation an invitation how about it I don't know fix it i uh uh mary is asking about you oh she was sure when you tell mom I'll be on deck tonight then i figured that i already told her hey we want to snag them on come on this mowing line is falled in our cutter headwind sir engine stop swinging right and drifting back low more sweep line toward the mine i had one third come left to your course my answer looking back on our course toward that middle number would make a great show with it a one-way ticket to davy jones here notify the other ship to stand by and maintain strain on the cable we'll lower boats and cut loose to mine send out a detail and post to one file of gear yes floor of the sir send out a detail to one file appear like yourself corny I don't worry about me they're doing all right those horns look different than the others i'm gonna take one back to skipper what do you call this one i want to get one of those what are those fellows doing which is if Smith's removing a harm all right taking the rest away not this thing don't go off and scared of right away okay easy boy this thing is sorry about those two men wells welch and ryan two good boys we're going to miss them well at least we have something to work on to prevent any larger tragedies as a result of these new mines what led you to believe this was a new design nash the Smither recognized it sir is that so smooth yes more hunch than anything definite the shape of the horn looks strong enough for safe handling aboard ship i figured it would detonate more easily than the others on contact you seem to have quite a knowledge of mine i've been making a study of them sir i'm turning you over to lieutenant gilpin you will both be transferred at once to his mind disposal unit the recommendation that you'll be sent to mind school for further instruction thank you sir thank you all right i fix it boy what a run of luck never happened to me before oh Jim Smith don't even move that money did he yeah i tried to get him to quit but he's an awful separate crap shooter hey fix it give me one of those i'm starved no a freshman hey i thought you was coming up the house to see mom oh i got tired of downtown extend my apologies i knew you'd make it good there you boys married that's another thing Jim if you don't watch that engine he's going to beat your time not without a struggle see you later come here oh eddie you like dancing naturally not man a sails out here but just dying to death if you but he can't get up he's not dead you can't get up to a little bit oh he's kind of bad trying to tell me that he's right out there the sun with a girl nevermantic i hope he can get a bug i'm getting a higher rating mary i know it eliot i think it's swell well what I was about to say was that i don't see any reason to celebrate just for getting another stripe i thought maybe you and i could figure out some really big reason for celebrating like yes miss max i didn't know you were that bashful i'd love to dance excuse us please you know the moral of the armed forces yes who Jim did you have anything to do with that what angie angie i never heard of it i had to see it mary they explained about not coming up in the house we probably had something more important isn't harbor beautiful so quiet and peaceful full of deceit to see yeah like a lot of things that seem all right on the surface yeah guess i'm all mixed up thank you very much until i popped out of nowhere you were all set to marry elliot I don't know june what are you trying to say i know what i'd like to say do you suppose a person could change that is it if they were different what i mean why didn't you tell me you'd want to dance with me i could excuse us sure now this illustrates with one variant of the nazi's much voted secret weapon which was supposed to bring england to her knees but it didn't work because through the extraordinary heroism of lieutenant commander uber of his majesty ship vernon the secret mechanism of this mine was discovered the english channel was opened again and england was able to receive her necessary war supplies the blockade was broken any questions have the jabs laid any new type mines off our coast most of them are the ordinary contact type as far as we know they nothing speaking oh yes sir i see yes there are then the men at once nash Smith here's a real opportunity to get some practical diving experience attenders

thank you sir uh reported senate well then why i sir i just thought you'd like to know about Smith looks like wayne's going to have no mind business today well many plants reported a sub in these

the roses are filled sort of an apology for not showing up last night hej uh where's mary you shouldn't have come here oh moms you're not gonna be sorry because i'm the day late are you you know that old adage better late than never oh hi mary now before you say anything you listen to me i've been rehearsing this thing for the last hour and if you interrupt me I'll have to blow the whole thing and you sit right down there have you been to the base well I'll get there all right look i've been wanting to say this to you for a long time I was afraid you might turn me down but look mary you're the only girl i ever really cared for and well holy mackerel what i'm trying to say is this is a fear with you anyway oh Jim then you don't know about fix it how you were aol we didn't know what happened we thought you might be sick he was worried and reported for duty in your place took your watch on the minesweeper he's a jab might fix it i had the nerve to come here and ask you to marry me it should have been me not him it could have happened to anybody no not anybody i killed him just as if i had laid that mine out there myself Jim I don't blame you i'm not gonna let this come between us i know because you're clean fine and honest everything i'm not everything i ever touched i spoiled i tell you it was an accident accident he knew where I was he knew I wasn't sick you know I was gambling do you get the dough to buy that ring so i'd make an impression on you i'm not what you think i am mary everything about me is a lie Jim don't talk like this even my name's a lie my name isn't Jim Smith it's richard houston i graduated from a nap i got a commission but that wasn't good enough no i had to be a big shot and i had to have money so i gambled and i lost and i borrowed money from my fellow officers to pay back what i had lost when i couldn't pay my debts i did the lowest thing a navy officer could do i deserve it i wandered around for a while trying to forget that i couldn't maybe it was in my blood and when the war broke i met fix it thought i could pay my debt by joining up i met you and i thought i could make a new life for myself now the same thing happened i lost my friend's life god forget about me mary dick houston walked out years ago Jim Smith never existed there isn't a place for either one of them in a decent society or in the navy that'll be 27.60 attention attention all leave and shore liberty cancel for men attached to the san pedro section return to the base at once emergency huh attention attention all leave ensure liberty cancel for men attached to the san pedro section hey look at this stuff or don't you we can't wait much longer we've got to get the transport out in time to meet our convoy but the channel has undoubtedly been mined my men are needed for a vital action in the south pacific if we don't get out today the convoy will have to proceed without us so why can't we sweep the channel again i doubt if it would do any good what's your suggestion we swept the channel and found no minds that one of our ships was blown up evidently the japs have developed some new device where does that leave us we take the transport out you probably be blown to kingdom come we don't we don't know yet hold the man in readiness reporting for duty sir a little late aren't you i know i should have been here yesterday but yeah I was a little under the weather i see the minute i heard the alert over the radio i reported immediately you've been speaking there must be mines on the floor of the channel and of the unmoored type we've got to locate one so we can find out what makes them tick on the floor of the channel sir it's like looking for a needle in a haystack well then we've got to find that needle how many divers have you got three divers sir oh yes sir we have four attached but one of them is a prisoner at large have them search the floor of the channel starting a thousand feet beyond the harbor gate there's a transport here that's got to be out in less than three hours understood sir I'll put the data to work at once yes sir ready both diving launches and prepare all men for diving i answer we're going to comb the floor of the channel and see if we can locate one of those mines what about Smith he's not available i I report to the chief master at arms you're a prisoner at large you only knew the circumstances sir i I wasn't exactly overly that was only one of the things I was referring to houston don't you think i'd be a lot more used to the navy if i were out there with a man and step in the break oh all right houston get to your diving launch but report back to me as soon as the job's finished ready greg the launchers are ready sir all right any word yet not yet sir but if they're out there they'll find them yes listening we bought one sir good what's it look like nash it's circular with a flat bottom something like an inverted flower phase plane overhead gives me an idea i think i've got the answer a way to explode them all better come up now there's a gadget of some sort fastened to the side by taking a part down here we should have the whole story sir it might be dangerous maybe a booby trap send Smith up first that's a Smith yeah for bringing you up go ahead nash grab each caught me consecutively so i can get the whole picture and take it easy those japs are tricky I'll be careful sir all what's the matter nash answer me he doesn't answer Smith gotta set him up right away I'll continue with him right go ahead break leave Smith down there and bring mash up something's happened to him we've lost contact i ice ready Smith give it to me carefully and watch yourself first is the steel ring about eight inches diameter steel ring inches in diameter six bolts rubber gasket under rain that's enough Smith the booby trap could be right behind the diaphragm don't touch it Smith pull up the line sir pull them up put the base in the radio at once mine located sir good work gilpin all right you knew the danger sir that's why send me up Jim Smith was davey through and through he certainly was my foreign
