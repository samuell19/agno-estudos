(soft, sensual music) - Anna, honey. I'm sorry. (Anna weeping) (climactic music) - What the fuck was that? Pathetic. Really, very disappointing. What do you think, Testamento? - You are right. Very disappointing. Didn't even get me hard. - Did you hear that? We're all not on the right track by any means and this was not our agreement. - I know how to get hard. (Sara whimpering) No! Get off her. - Calm the fuck down. It would appear to me you're in no position to be playing the hero right now. - Please. Leave us alone. Please. - Stop filming. Now, let's start again, shall we? Don't worry, the first time is almost never the right one. But we don't have all night. So let's start again, but put some effort in this time. I wanna see some commitment. Show me that you're a strong couple. Close. Connected. Loving. I want to see some love. I wanna see that you're a stallion. Show me you can still make your wife cum. Make her cum here. Here in the middle. - (whimpers) We will do whatever you want, but please let our daughter leave the room. Don't make her watch. - What? Are you still tryin' to order us around?! We make the rules 'round here, you mouthy little bitch. We make the rules! (fist thudding) Testamento, kill her! (woman whimpering and thudding) (woman gasping) - Look at her. She look like a chicken without her head. (squawks) A chicken without a head. (men laughing) No! (gun blasting) (Woman gasping) - Did you get it? - No, I didn't. - What do you mean you didn't fucking get it, you idiot? Can't believe you're my fucking brother! You film a shit fuck and miss an amazing death! You better fucking get this one. Open your mouth, open your mouth! This'll be the best thing you've ever sucked! (gun blasting) (neck cracking) (ominous music) (clothes shuffling) Don't worry, little brother. You alright? - Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. - No need to apologize. One day you'll get used to it. One day you'll understand. It's not enough. Not even here, nothin' at all? - Should we go now? - Yeah. Come on. Let's go. (urine trickling) Hey mind your spaghetti, let's go. (zipper zipping) - Okay, I'll come in a second. (crickets chirping) (van engine roaring) (ominous music) (woman gaping) (woman screaming) (zombie growling) (flesh squishing) (zombies growling) (Mikey gasping) (door creaking) (Mikey breathing heavily) (suspenseful music) - Hey, gotcha. - Daddy. - Why you always hiding up here, huh? Come on you little monster, let's go and find your mom. - We're here live at the scene where a violent extortion took place last night. Family members' of entrepreneur Luca Hicks had been found dead inside their house this morning at dawn. On their bodies, signs of violence and torture. The investigators are worried this is just the same criminal gang who've already made similar crimes in this area. - John! - Okay, April! - Daddy, what are you doing? - We're doing grownup things. Hi, gorgeous. - I didn't hear you come in. - [Mikey] Dad, why don't we play my room? - Well I was actually hoping that your mother and I would go to our room to play. - John, please. - What, are you worried about him playing upstairs on his own? - On his own? No, he's with Paul. - I didn't see him. - (sighs) Still possibly can't look after his own brother for 10 minutes. - No no no, don't worry I'll deal with it. You carry on cookin'. I'm starving. (muffled TV crosstalk) (light rock music) (muffled lyrics) Come on, let's go and find that rascally little brother of yours. You know, I think mommy's a little bit upset with him. You know what mommy's like when she gets angry. (knocks) Paul? Paul! (energetic rock music) Paul? Paul! - Hi, dad. - So, this is how you look after your brother, is it? - We're at home, what could ever happen? - [John] He's still young, we have to look after him. - Oh for God's sake, you sound like mom. - Bad day? - As usual. - Paul, why do you always act like this? - I lost my iPhone. - Paul, it was brand new. - It wasn't my fault! - You need to look after your things. Money doesn't grow on trees. - Well fortunately my dad is a scientist. - Well unfortunately, things might change. They won't always stay this way. - So make sure things don't change. Keep on pleasing your Yankee friends. - I've told you they're not my friends. I've never met them in person. - If you ask me, as long as they keep throwing money at you they're more than friends. - Sometimes I think I haven't taught you anything. - I'm a disappointment, I know. - That's not what I said. - I'll never be like you. - I wouldn't want you to be. - Sorry to interrupt your man talk, but dinner's ready. Come on. - Come on. (soft, soothing music) (phone clicking) - Would you fuckin' stop it? - Sorry? - You can light up the whole fucking town with that thing. You wanna get a scene? Will you put it away? So? - It seems okay. An isolated house. No excessive security measures. They have an alarm, but it's not switched on. - It must be our lucky day, eh? It's gonna be a walk in the park. - Come on, we're gonna have a real good time tonight. There's also a kid this time. - A kid? - Son. We will all have to grow up sometime. - (sighs) Why don't we find another house? - What the fuck? I can't believe we were spawned from the same fuckin' mother! Will you shut the fuck up? What do you think, Testamento? I want them! - We will have them, my friend. We will. (foreboding music) (game blasting) - Sweet dreams, my little monkey. Muah. (soft, somber music) - You are so beautiful. - Oh, honey. - I know it's been a lot of years, but I still can't get enough of you. - You know, you really shouldn't be so hard on Paul. He is your son. - He needs to learn... - Just keep the volume down. Mikey's trying to sleep. - All I'm saying is he needs to learn a little respect. Respect for me, respect for what I do for this family. - Paul isn't entirely to blame. You could try spending more time with him, with all of us. - I know, you are right. - Look honey, I know how important your job is to you. Really, I do. But it isn't everything. (ominous thudding) You know... What was that noise? - It was probably just Paul downstairs. - No, it sounded like it was oomin' from the lab. - I'll go and check. - John? Have I got anything to worry about? - No, no everything's gonna be okay. (game blasting) - I'll come with you. - No. - I heard a noise, let me come with you. - You can't, trust me. - You feel ashamed, don't you? _ It's just my job. I'm not a monster, Paul. - All these years, you've never allowed us to see-- mom and I. - It's just not possible. - Alright, top secret. Then you'd have to kill us, I suppose. - Paul. - I'm joking. Dad. - Mhmm? - Sorry for before, I went too far. . Okay- - You're a good dad. - I know. (foreboding music) (computer beeping) - Hey, fucking take it. (gun cocking) (door booming) (muffled video game crosstalk) - Everything okay? - Everything is fine. So seeing as dinner was a complete disaster, how 'bout a family Friday? - Film? - Popcorn? - Film and popcorn. - Sorted then. - (sighs) How long's he gonna be? It's been fuckin' ages. - Here we go. Get ready. - Okay guys, popcorn's ready. - Great, so Paul, you choose the film. I'll get the projector. - I have to finish this mission first. - How can you play these cruel games? - Well, let's have a look. - They're not just cruel, they're brilliant. - So violent, like we don't have enough in the real world. - You know mom, I think it's for that reason people make this kind of game. So we can better understand the world in which we are living. - Seems like we have a philosopher in our midst. (doorbell ringing) You expecting anyone? - No. No no, stay there. I'll come back. (foreboding music) - Hi Elena, the gate was open, so that's... - Hi GG, but we didn't order. (gun blasting) - Nobody fuckin' move! (Elena gasping and whimpering) - What do you want? -Everything. (intense dark music) (Elena whimpering) - Mommy, daddy! - No, Mikey! (gun smacking) - Have you moved the van? - Yes, I did. (John groaning) - Mikey. - Shhh. It took him ages to get to sleep and now you wanna wake him up? I wouldn't advise it, my friend. If that little shit starts screamin' again, I'll put a fuckin' bullet in his head. - Please don't. (Elena whimpering) Elena! No, get off her! - What about (speaks foreign language)? - Get off her! (grunts) - Calm down. Testamento knows how to deal with a pussy I assure you. You won't be able to tell if she's screaming with pain or screaming with pleasure. - You can bet on it. She's so wet. What the fuck? (chuckles) It seems more blood than anything else. - (laughs) I fuckin' love you, man. You're one sick puppy. (John grunting) Where the fuck do you think you're going? (feet smacking) (John groaning) Don't you fucking move. You film everything? - Yeah. - Good boy. You'll make a great director one day. Gus Van Sant would deep throat your cock. Just you wait and see. That's another thing I don't understand about you rich. The more money you have, the more you seem to wanna stay warm. What the fuck is that all about? It's already fuckin' boilin' hot out there. It's like Hell in here. I tell you what, when you get to the fiery gates, you'll be right at home. - But we're not that rich. - Oh no. (chuckles) What, you mean there are richer people than you are then? You think perhaps maybe we should go and see them? It's not your lucky day, is it? And here we are in your beautiful home with your beautiful family. Fuckin' hot. (Elena whimpering) What's the matter with you? Why didn't you look at me? Is it because I'm ugly? Does my face offend you? - It's not that. - Oh, I see. Are you scared? Does my unmasked face frighten you? - I don't want to look at you. I just want you to leave my family alone. - What about you, son? Aren't you afraid of lookin' at my unmasked face? Are you the real man of the house? You strike me as the sort of boy who watches lots of movies. Tell me, what does it mean when a criminal unmasks his face in front of his hostages? Tell me, what does it mean? - You kill us. - Haven't you finished with her yet, Testamento? Why don't you bring her over here and we'll play happy families. (Testamento laughing) (Elena whimpering) All this fuss. It's just a flesh wound. She's not exactly dying, is she? (chuckles) Well, not yet anyway. - She cannot complain at all about my special treatment. Don't you see? She already feels better. - Tell me, mummy, (Elena gasping) has anyone given you such an invigoratin' lickin' in all your life? Come on, you can tell us. We're old friends here. (Weeps) Leave. Just leave, please go. Tell me, did you ever lick your wife? Do you ever go down on her, do ya? Stick your tongue inside her? Feel her juices runnin' into your mouth? Do you ever lick her clit 'til she screams for you to stop? I don't believe it. You're one of those blokes who doesn't really appreciate what a woman has to offer. Do ya? What is it? You don't know where to put your tongue or something? Oh, I know what it is. You prefer a little bit of cock, don't ya? Do ya? Do you like a bit of cock, do ya? I bet you like a blowjob, don't ya? She good, is she? Tell me, (John groaning) is your wife good at sucking cock? Eh? You care to suck your cock, do ya? I bet you push her head down, do ya? Just a little bit too hard. Just so the tip of your cock goes down the tip of her throat, making her gag a little, yeah? Oh yeah. So tell me, she good at sucking cock, is she? So, should we try a field test, shall we? (John and Elena whimpering) - [John] She's good. - Good at what? - (sobs) She's good at blowjobs. - What's wrong with you? Do you feel ashamed or something? I wanna hear you say it. In fact, I'll tell you what. You look at your boy over there and you tell him your mother's a filthy whore who loves sucking cock. - Paul. No more. (sobs) I can't, please just stop. - Oh, come on. No way, daddy. No fucking way. This should be a more problem-free environment with the family. You should be able to express things freely and honestly. You're an intelligent man. I see you read a lot of books. I've read a lot of books too, you know. In fact, I'm quite a cultured man, believe it or not. Well, I spent a lot of time in prison. Where else would you find the time to read a lot of fuckin' books? Don't worry about it anyway. Let's talk about why we're really here, eh? - What? - Money of course. Whatever precious things you have in your beautiful home. I'm sure you've got a safe in here, haven't ya? - Yes, upstairs. - Okay, after you. - So you're gonna kill us? - Not just yet. We got the whole night to kill first. - But why are you doing this? I mean if it's just about the money, take the money. But why are you doing all this? - It's not just about the money. I told you I studied a lot when I was in prison. I may not have a fancy degree, doctor, but I understood. I have many questions and I found answers to them all. - What are you talking about? - (chuckles) That you and people like you deserve it. - Nobody, nobody. Nobody deserves this. - I beg to differ. - We are good people. - Sure you are, but we're all just a plague eatin' away at this planet. You know what, mother nature created people like Testamento and I to restore a little balance. You know, the same thing's gonna happen to me one day. Unlike you, you spineless, self-absorbed little cunt, I'll have understood why. (soft ominous music) - Can I ask you something? - Fire away. - Please kill my children. The youngest one first and then Paul please. Don't hurt them, just kill them. - And then? - And then kill my wife. If you're not going to. You haven't finished with her yet. - No I can't deny it, my friend. It's gonna be a very very long night for her. Her last and most certainly her longest. - (weeps) Just kill me. I don't care, just do whatever you want. Just kill me. I don't want to see. (gun bashing) (John grunting) - Do you think me so merciful? Do I look like someone I can bargain with? You don't understand a fucking thing! - Done? - Done. This really is a magnificent house. Some really lovely things here. - They didn't deserve it for sure. Lucky for them we arrived. - Oh the ways of the Lord. The little one's waking up. - I gagged him so he won't scream. - Good, that noise is very annoying to me. If he starts screamin' again, I'll have to burst his little head open. (Mikey whimpering) Not with a gun. No, you can't waste bullets on such things. I know, I'll step on it. That beautiful little head. I want to feel it cracking and breaking under my foot. (man vomiting) - Stop it, please! - Oh come on, I'm only joking. We're not complete monsters, you know. We're playing a nice game. - Yes a nice game. - Now, let's take it in turns to free up a little secret. A tiny little bubble of truth you've kept locked up inside. Everyone has a secret, a nasty little shadow lurking in the darkest corners of their soul. I don't wanna hear about you knockin' one out in the bathroom. That's no secret. Don't you tell me you wanna suck my cock 'cause it's obvious that you do. Somethin' a bit wild and wacky. Just let it go. You got cocksucker written all over your forehead. No, it doesn't come off. (laughs) (Testamento laughing) However we understand each other. If you tell me a shitty secret, Testamento will smash the fucking kid's head in. (foreboding music) Let's start with You. (Mikey whimpering) - Mikey's not your son. - [Nibbio] Ooh, interesting. - It happened. I love another man. We've been in love for years. I didn't plan it. It just happened. I don't wanna take this secret with me to the grave. (Nibbio laughing) - Do you hear that? We are both sons of a bitch. - Bravo. Pure poetry. What a beautiful, beautiful secret. You know, someone said... Who was it now? No, it doesn't matter. You know, someone said that when love is kindled from within a secret, it ceases to be when it's no longer a secret. Tell me mommy, is that true? See, you thought she was yours, but she was slowly slipping away. Because of your selfishness and blindness, you didn't see it. In the end, it's always selfishness. We love others to please ourselves and we think that those who love us belong to us. It's just bullshit. Have you ever thought about this? When you fuck a woman, does that mean you possess her? Does that mean you own her? (chuckles) The fuck it does. Doesn't mean anything. Nobody belongs to anyone ever. And now, let's hear from you. What's your secret? Tell me. Do you have anything? Tantalizing isn't it? - I don't have any secrets. - Do you really wanna see your son's brains pour from Testamento's hands? - I have no secrets. (ominous banging) (Elena gasping) - The fuck was that? - It came from over there. - What's in there? - Nothing. - Oh come on. Do you really expect me to believe that? Don't mug me off. I can make your last hours very, very uncomfortable. - It's my private lab. I do experiments on animals. - Animals, cool. I like animals. - They're sedated in their cells. It must be the effects of the sedatives wearing off. - Wow, we have a doctor in our midst. Well doctor, how 'bout taking my friend Testamento down to see your little animals? Would you mind? - I'd prefer not to. - Well you haven't really got a fuckin' choice, have you? Now, you go downstairs with him and while you're down there I'm gonna get my little brother to fuck your beautiful wife in the ass. Now, you told me you didn't want to see. So fuck off downstairs before you really upset me! - Nibbio, I don't know. Why don't we just go? - Shut up! Shut the fuck up! Just shut up! For once in your miserable fucking life, will you do as I tell you and get it fucking right?! Fucking move. What're you waitin' for'? What are you waitin' for?! C'mere, you fuckin' whore! Fucking get on with it! Do it now! (foreboding music) - Whoa dude, it seems like we already went up those sci-fi video games! Whoa. - We finally have the results of the new human test subjects. They all died a non-violent natural death. Unexpected results for this stage of the advanced project. However after various failed attempts, we are beginning to see progress. Thanks to the unprecedented combination of combining human DNA cells, dead cells, and exogenous DNA. (computer beeping) (Elena weeping) - [Nibbio] What the fuck is wrong with you? Come on little brother, show me you're a man. Come on, fuck this whore, now! What's wrong with you, can't you fucking get it up? You're pathetic! Totally and utterly fucking pathetic! - Whether they (mumbles) research centers have failed, we are beginning to be successful... (glass tapping) (creature gurgling) - Whoa! What the fuck is this? (zombie shrieking) What the fuck was that? - However, for those involved in the project the Beautiful People... - Open the door (mumbles). (zombie growling) (Testamento muffled screaming) - What? What the fuck was that? Testamento! (suspenseful music) - Nobody move! (hand banging) - Mikey, the attic where you always go to play. You must hide upstairs like you always used to, okay? And don't move for any reason. Hey! - No! Don't do it please. You're not like them. (gun clicking) Please. (ominous music) (door creaking and banging) (lights fizzing) - Testamento? (zombie growling) Testamento. (zombie growling) What the fuck are you doing? (gun blasting) - Let's go. - Oh Testamento, my old friend. (gun blasting) (John wincing) (zombie growling) No! (John grunting) (zombie snarling) (John breathing heavily) (John wincing) - Fuck! Brett, (mumbles)! Where are you? You fucking prick! You fucking prick! - We'll have to get as far away from here as possible or my brother will kill us all. Do you understand? Come on. Come on, come on! (ominous music) (John grunting) (zombies growling) (John screaming) (flesh tearing) (foot thudding) (zombies growling) (gun blasting) - What were you doing downstairs, you fuck? (zombies growling) (car engine wincing and roaring) - Mikey, I can't leave Mikey! - Mikey's hidden, he's safe. No! - Fuck no, fuck! (tires screeching) (zombies growling) (intense dark music) (Elena gasping) (engine revving) - You big cunt! My own fuckin' brother! (car squealing and thudding) (zombies growling) (Elena panicking) (gun cocking) (zombie growling) (fist smacking) (zombie growling) - Oh my God, what is that? - Come on, let's go! (zombies growling) - The project, the project has been compromised. I repeat, the project is compromised. Send a (mumbles) immediately. We need to contain. (zombies shrieking) (gun blasting) (zombies growling) (zombies growling) (John grunting) (zombies snarling) (ominous music) (flesh squishing) (zombies growling) (zombie growling) (foreboding music) - I don't know where we are. I'm lost. - Follow me. I know where we can go. - Run, little brother. (zombies growling) (bird cawing) - Here we are, the Scares' house. We can get help. - Is it him? Felipe Soares? Did you cheat on dad with him? - Just move! (foreboding music) (birds chirping) (knocking on door ) Felipe! Rosa! It's me, Elena, please help! Please help! - Wait here. - Felipe! - I'm gonna see if there's a car. - Please. We need help! Rosa! Felipe, it's me Elena. Please help! Please help. Rosa! Help! Please, we need help. (zombie snarling) (Brett screaming) Please help us! (zombie snarling) Paul! (zombie growling) (Brett shouting) (ax thudding) (Elena screaming) (zombie gurgling) - There's more at the back. Let's go back to the wood. Come on, let's go. (zombie growling) (foreboding music) Hurry up! Whoa! - Hello, little brother. Come on then, let's see what you're made of. (Brett grunting) (knife thudding) (Elena panicking) I tried to educate you, but you're nothing but a failure. (Brett grunting) (knife slashing) (Brett wincing) We may have the same mother, but You definitely came out of her asshole. (climactic music) (gun blasting) (laughs) Your mother must be so proud. You really are a fucking idiot. (creature growling) (Elena shrieking) (Nibbio gurgling) - John, no. (creature growling) Take me, take me! (climatic music) (creature snarling) (Elena breathing heavily) (creature snarling) (birds chirping) (stones shuffling) (Elena gasping) - There you are! There you are. We need to go right now. - Paul, Mikey... I have to go back for Mikey. - Paul is fine. I saw him escape before they came, the monsters. - You saw him? He's okay? - Yes, come on let's go. Come on! (foreboding music) (zombie growling) (flesh tearing) (river trickling) (Brett wincing) - We need to find help. I need to find Paul. I want to go back for Mikey. Shh! (muffled) Help! Help! Come on, come on. (muffled) Help! Help! (muffled) Help! Help! (muffled) Help! (river trickling) (intense music) (Brett grunting repeatedly) (skull crunching repeatedly) (Brett grunts with effort) (skull crunches) (intense music) (water trickling) (bird morning calls) - I have a feeling the situation got outta hand. - You can say that again. - They're everywhere. Some of them already reached the town. We won't be able to stop the news from spreading. - We won't be able to stop the virus from spreadin' neither. - We found a survivor. He was hiding in the attic. He's upset, but he's fine. - Was he bitten? - No, he has no wounds or bites. They didn't touch him. - We don't need him. You know what to do. (gun shot) (ominous music) (birds twittering) (intense dark music) (muffled shouting) - The American government denies any connection to the virus that's spreading around the world. (zombie growling) (muffled shouting) (zombies snarling) (muffled radio crosstalk) (zombie shrieking) Do not leave your house for any reason. But wait for the intervention of the military forces. (zombies snarling) (flesh tearing) (muffled crosstalk) (muffled shouting) (creature growling) (muffled radio crosstalk) (ambulance beeping) The situation at the moment is out of control. The panic has sprawled through (mumbles).
