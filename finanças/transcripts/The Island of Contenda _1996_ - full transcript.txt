CONTENDA ISLAND CABO VERDE - ILHA DE FOGO 30TH APRIL 1963 Poor thing! Well, mother... Are you feeling better? I'm all right. If I asked for you it's just because I'm worried about the preparations for the feast day. I told Caela not to worry. I'll deal with everything. Everything is all right. Don't worry. It's not all right. These celebrations must show everyone who the Medina da Veiga's are. - Who doesn't know that, Caela? Let's get down to brass tacks. Under St. Philips' banner we are organizing the celebrations. And that is something. - I know. It's not the first time. - And it won't be the last. Eusébio... Go and have a little rest... mother... How many animals did you have killed? Oh mother. I told you time and again... Seven pigs, three goats and a calf. - That's nothing. - But, mother... we haven't... Kill four more pigs and three goats. - We can't mother, we can't... - I've given you an order. I want everything ready before the celebrations begin. Yes, mother. Your father was a good-looking man. Eusébio. They say I look like him. Chiquinho, have you done everything I asked? Yes, but Felisberto said he'd only get the animals later. - He's got an errand for Anacleto. - What! That Felisberto! Have you ever seen anything like it? He grovels to Anacleto. Times have changed. Chiquinho, go and tell Felisberto to deal with those animals right away. - I'm going. - Wait. Tell him my mother sent you. Listen, Franck. I'm here thinking one day I'll carry the banner of our St. Philip. You're joking. You, Anacleto, son of Domingona, carrying the banner of St. Philip! What's so strange about that? Do you think I can't afford to give a party for the followers of St. Philip? - I don't doubt that. But... - But what, Franck? Before I went to America. St. Philip's was a feast day for high society. And by the looks of it. It still is. Up to now! Up to now... What a fright you gave me! What's the matter? - What's the matter? - I fell down. That's what the matter! I'm exhausted. You and Anacleto will be the death of me! Still serving two masters. I am so thirsty. Chiquinho, go and fetch your father. Sir, if you please. Into your hands Oh Lord we deliver the soul of your servant Caela who has departed this world. Forgive her trespasses, that she may gain everlasting life. Through Jesus Christ. Our Lord. Amen. So my dear Noca, that just leaves Eusébio... Everything around him is destroyed. What can he do alone? For Heavens' Sake, Noca, he's just come into a considerable fortune. Everything the Medina da Veiga's have built up will have to be divided. The days of the aristocracy are gone for ever, Felisberto. You've said it. Caela was the last of our line. - Mr. Carneiro, - Chiquinho. Is your father in? Yes, just a moment. Eusébio... Chiquinho, did you go by the Estate to deal with the taxes? Yes, everything is in order. You can go. Mr. Carneiro is here to speak to you. Oh no! What a nuisance. Send him in. - Good morning, Sir. - Good morning, Mr. Carneiro. I'm afraid I'm here on the matter of a debt. As you know it's now over 200.000... 230.000 escudos. Mr. Carneiro, I never forget my debts! - But with the death of my mother... - My deepest sympathy. I've been going over the inheritance and I can't settle that debt right away. I'm not doubting you. You've always been reliable, but that debt is over a year old. - I know, I know. - You understand... Listen, don't worry. I'll settle the whole amount within 6 months. Six months! You know the factory in Guimaraes is being renovated, there are the bills to be paid, the new machinery. I know, I know. So, in fact, the board of directors needs to raise money urgently and we think the best thing is to transfer the debt to the Bank. Transfer it. I don't understand. How? With bills of exchange. Bills? I don't know what to say. I hadn't thought of that. Chiquinho! Coffee for Mr. Carneiro. Count on me, Anacleto. I'll bring everything from the customs tomorrow. Good. Oh Felisberto, I need you to take me to Contenda Island tomorrow. I'll take you, Eusébio, don't worry. I've just got to do a job for Anacleto. You're always running after that Anacleto. Anacleto is a good man, and besides he pays on the dot. Money, money, that's all people think about. I heard about Carneiro. What a nuisance. Where am I going to get the money? Maybe the first instalment with a bit in reserve and the annual coffee sales... What about the third, fourth, fifth instalment? I'll have a big sale at the shop and get rid of all that rubbish. You ought to modernise the shop. Attract new customers, new business, Build your own business. I'm not interested in business. That's for the Anacletos of this world. If you really want to know, I'm fed up with the shop. Oh mummy! What a lovely evening. And a "Morna"! It's so long since I heard one. Look, it's Dr. Vicente. - Isn't he handsome? - Ondina! What are you thinking of? Look at this! Where would you see a doctor singing along with these people? - Oh daddy! What's wrong with that? - I don't want you joining in. But the music is so nice. Come in and shut the window. At once. - Felisberto, don't be so hard on her. - That's all I need. Fuzzy aired golliwogs in my home. Not for my daughter! Come in at once! If that black door comes round after my daughter I'll give him what for. Dr. Vicente is a good man. A damned half-caste. That's what he is. He's a fine doctor. He can go to Hell. Damn it. Damn! I almost burned myself. You see, you are getting all heated up. And you wouldn't get heated up if you fell into a volcano. My dear cousin. Things are not the same. Our families used to give the orders around here and half-castes wouldn't dare to climb our steps. Well. Look at you. If it wasn't for Anacleto how would you provide for your wife and child? This radiator needs replacing. I'm getting a new one. Is that you, Eusébio? I didn't expect you so early. Eusébio... Soila... Get dressed. - That's no way to receive guests. - It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter for you, but it's not right for Soila. Hurry up, Soila and you come in, son. Join us for lunch, won't you? - It's real whalebone. - Made by José Claudio himself. Captain José Claudio, whale hunter... One among many who left here for good, wasn't he? Some left for good, some came back. José Claudio. When he arrived in my village in Chile. I was 14. I married him and embarked with him. 14 years old and never known another man! - Eusébio! We lived in the States and then passed the Azores. Always on the same ship? My ship of fate. It brought me to Cape Verde. I was 18. He disappeared and left me a childless widow. But Soila is like a daughter to you. It's the same ship. Both widows, both childless, the same fate. Waste land... ...a circle of fire. Ah Manuel, I didn't hear you arrive. Is everything alright? Yes, it's all prepared because of the rains. Here is a list of supplies. You know Manuel. I may be selling my share of crops. - The price is so very low, Eusébio, you should only sell after the rains, after October. I know, I know, but I can't wait. I need the money now. Nobody does that on Contenda Island, but you know best. - How's the cattle? - Poor. We'll look into that tomorrow, the stores, the cattle, Everything is in order, as usual. You may go. I want to have a serious talk with you. That piece of land... That piece of land will only be mine when Mariquinha dies, which I hope won't be for a long time. - I know, I know. That piece of land which will be yours was sold by my great grandfather to José Claudio. All this around was Contenda Island. And so? Se we can come to an understanding. You sell me your bit and everything will be as it was. Sell you my bit! And where do I go? You don't go anywhere. I buy the property off you but you keep the house. Do you want to buy me too? I'm not joking, Soila. - I'm making you a serious proposition. - Why do you want more land? You're not married. You've got no children. Sentimental reasons. My parents always liked it. It's all here. Yes, sir, good crops this year. Good land. It would be if only it would rain. If it rained and if we had a manager like Manuel. Manuel was my mother's right hand man and he still is. What about the inheritance? Is the land shared out? My sisters are agreed. Now, all we need is Alberto's answer. If all goes well, Contenda Island will go back to what it was. Here's Felisberto. Eusébio, you must come at once. Something dreadful has happened. Something dreadful. What is it? - It's Ondina. She got appendicitis. - Appendicitis? Acute! Acute appendicitis. She needs an emergency operation. Calm down man. It's a simple operation, nothing serious. Not serious! It's my daughter. How do you know if it is serious? Anyway, have you thought who's going to operate? Well Alice? She's in the hands of God. In the hands of that quack. I'd say. My God! He's looking at her private parts! Keep calm. Felisberto. Don't lose your dignity. You must remain calm. If you knew what I felt like doing. The operation was a success. Ondina is out of danger. Thank God for that! Thanks to Our Lady. ...and don't forget Augusto, that was the first major operation performed on the island. The first operation? The first? Really? The first operation. Listen to him. Felisberto does exaggerate. - When Dr. Raphael was in practice... - What! When Dr. Raphael was in practice he performed 4 or 5 much more difficult operations. Times were different then. Anyway Dr. Raphael was a respected man, not like this "fuzzy-wuzzy". - Well, God knows how he did it. - Don't say that Felisberto. Dr. Vicente may be in the flower of youth but he is very promising and competent. - Competent! For minor ailments. - He operated on Ondina beautifully. Taking out an appendix isn't anything special. In the States they do it by correspondence. By correspondence? Look everyone. Two telegrams today. Important visitors are arriving on the next ship. Important visitors? Alberto, Eusébio's brother and his Excellency the Governor. I'll have a glass of punch. Long live His Excellency, the governor. Long live Cape Verde. Long live Portugal. I would like to stress that among Cape Verde idiosyncrasies the heroic island of Fogo has special place in the many tasks I have to carry out. I expect a great deal from you. We cannot stand idly by because there is nothing worse than scepticism to erode the spirit. All together we shall stand. Long live Portugal. Anacleto owns a mansion! Yes, Anacleto, City Hall worker and hosting the Governor. And this is not all. The health delegate is a mulatto with Kinky hair. Can you imagine this, Onofre? Anacleto owning a mansion and throwing parties for the Governor. It looks like the Fogo families have been cursed. They say he even throws cakes to the street like the old days. He's has never seen money! Cakes thrown to the street? It's tradition. Tradition? His tradition was going after the cakes. Tradition... now they copy us. Apes is what they all are. Formerly, the apes lived in trees. Blacks on the ground, mulattoes in the lodge and whites in the house. Now I don't know anymore. I feel like walking. Chiquinho, do you want to show me around? - I'd never seen sand this dark. - It's sand from the volcano. - And you? - What about me? Are you also make of volcano? You know, here we all are a bit. Idiosyncrasies! Idiosyncrasies! This one is a great Governor, The most intelligent that has ever set foot on the archipelago. But what does that mean? Idio... Will you excuse me? Idiosyncrasies... Your problem is you don't read, you don't study José Maria Relvas' Grammar. You don't know the masters of the Portuguese language. Who's that man? Augusto. A lighthouse-keeper for St. Philippe's inspector. - Lighthouse-keeper? - Yes. He talks a blue streak. He takes his time memorizing books and then comes here parroting. He's not one of the most dangerous. A dictator! Did you hear when the Governor spoke of the soul's erosion? It seems that the Governor's words were listened to attentively. Well, not by everyone I'm afraid. Yes, I noticed the health delegate didn't show much enthusiasm but I'm told he's a competent doctor. Dr. Vicente? He's not bad. But... he's got his own ideas. Unfortunately duty calls. Thank you for your company and your valuable information and if we don't meet again, and in case you need it I'll leave you my address. Keep in touch. Anything out of the ordinary... you know. Ah, inspector, thank you, of course. I'll do all I can. Count on me. Don't worry about expenses. There's always money for these things. I've been thinking and I've decided to sell the business. If you agree with my plan about the sharing out. Right. Let's deal with this inheritance you're so worried about. Good morning. Good morning. Very good, very good 26 beds is all we have, your Excellency. - Is that enough? - For a population of 24.000! Well, as far as I know, the island of Fogo has a mild climate, good water. People live and die all over the world. The doctor is to be congratulated. The hospital is small but functional, clean and this garden is lovely. Oh Chiquinho, come on. I can't do everything alone. - So...? - All right, I'm coming. It seems to be very well shared out. I tried... as you can imagine... As you know, all I want is Contenda Island. Let's get down to it. I also have my preferences. As the eldest son. I'd like to keep this estate with house and respective contents. As for me... It's a sentimental matter. Sentimental! Who's interested in the Governor? Be careful, Vicente, walls have ears. Whatever I have to say. I say it doctor. The sheets have holes, there are no medicines, no surgical equipment. The authorities couldn't give a damn for the health of the population, the conditions of the Hospital, etc. All they care about are appearances. You're going to have a lot to learn. I can't stand it, this sham, this lack of concern. The best thing I ever did was to retire. I didn't really retire. I went into exile. Sometimes I'm afraid of losing you. Don't be silly. You fool... This caju sweet... Eusébio... for some time I've felt that my skin is dry, dead, here, and here... - Let me see. - I'm shy. - Why? Does it hurt? No, it doesn't hurt, but it looks horrible. So, show it to doctor Vincent. Showing it to doctor Vincent... No way. I'll never do it. This cough. Soila, it hurts my chest. I'm worse. A nice plate of chicken soup and some cough mixture and you'll soon be better. One day chicken soup won't be enough. In Chile, near my village, there are some big trees. I believe they went straight to Heaven and one day I'd climb up... - Your country must be lovely. You know... I was only 14 when I married and embarked on José Claudio's ship. I know, Mariquinha, I know. You couldn't treat me better if you were my own daughter. I'm more than your daughter. You shared my fate. Both widows... Childless... I don't know what's in a worse state, the road or the truck. This is nothing, Alberto. The procession is still in the churchyard. Are you sure there's no other form of transport? Not a hope, and further on, only on horseback. Good God! Wasn't it you who wanted to see over the properties with your own eyes? I always thought things had improved. It'll go. I'll make sure of that. The Blue Star is a great truck. Two or three wires and it'll be as good as new. Well, I'll go and visit Mariquinha and Soila. Manuel. Hello, Alberto. What a difference. I left here 40 years ago, Manuel. I was already a man. We all age. 40 years is a long time. Only God doesn't age. We're not boys any longer. Chasing butterflies. But the face, the hair... The eyes, Alberto. The eyes are not the same. Years of hard work in Angola. Manuel. Hard work, Something that nobody here knows what that means. No? Have you forgotten suffering? Only we know what that means. Eusébio, what about the sharing out? Better than I thought. My brother only wants the money. He went over the accounts, measured the land, checked the crops, poked his nose into everything. In the end all he wanted was the property in town. He's probably thinking of coming back. I couldn't care less. All I care about is Contenda Island and that's finally mine. So, let's celebrate. But for the island to be what it was... ...it just needs a little... That "little" isn't for sale. Are you staying for lunch? Look up there. There's a fortune up there. See that hole? When it rains the water pours through. I've got a plan. Fill that hole with water. Don't touch it and in the dry season sell it for so much a tin. You gain a lot of money. Not a bad idea but to be economically viable you need a plan, drawn up by an engineer. Economically viable! What rubbish. If you draw up a plan you'll ruin everything. No, a good builder can do it in a tick. Is the land yours or not? No, but it is as if it were. It belongs to my cousin Noca. Well, I've spoken to her but you could put in a word. Forgive me but I don't want to get involved. Damn this thing! I can't fix it. I'll have to go back to St. Phillip to get a spare part. - What?! - It won't go up the hill. But what about us? Me and Eusébio? No problem. You spend the night here and tomorrow morning early I'll be back, O.K.? Why is the shop empty? Anacleto is having a sale. Your father isn't much of a business man, is he? Eusébio? You know... Eusébio? Is he your father? Yes... but here... - Come on, you're a man now. - I am? Put me down. Let me go. Can't you do better than that? Put on my sandal. Come on. Put it on. Give me your foot. - Esmeralda? - Yes? Come on, say it. Do you want me to take you to the beach? Ask me in creole. Do you want me to take you to the beach? The one with black sand? They're all like that. What a fright you gave me. Felisberto. Ah that's me. I can't resist a pretty girl. - Do you want to come out with me? - You're very cheeky. Don't you want to come for a ride? I'm in no hurry. I'm going to buy some pills for Noca. What! Is cousin Noca ill? She's in bed with a cold. I'm the one who's going to buy the pills. I'll take them round. - If you insist. - Of course I insist. Go on home and tell her I won't be a minute. Come here. Guidinha, have you got the money? Good Heavens. Cousin Noca you're ill and you don't send for me? It's only a cold, Felisberto. I only need a cup of tea and a pill. I went to get them myself. Here they are. You must wrap up warm. You're running a temperature. You shouldn't be here alone. You've got things to do. Guida will look after me. She's not much good but she takes care of me. Guida, if you had to depend on Guida, but you don't. You've got a family who cares for you. - Here's your tea. - Thank you. Take your pills. Give them here. I'm going home but I'll come back later and stay with you. That's very kind of you, but don't bother. I'll call you if I need you. No way. No way. I insist. These things are always worse at night. It's all arranged. Tonight I'll stay here. All night! Just because of a cold? You don't seem to understand. At her age she must be careful. Well if you think so, perhaps I ought to go too. Don't be silly. You can't leave Ondina alone. - Daddy. - What Daddy! What rubbish! I went to see the hole at Ribeira Filipe today with cousin Alberto. He thinks my plan is a great idea. If you... Let's talk about this another time. I need to think about it and today I'm really tired. I didn't mean to bother you... ...but its my dream. - Does Noca need anything? - No, she's all right. Get going. Don't worry. I'm here if anything is needed. You're an angel, Felisberto. Get some rest. Go to sleep. Don't you want to say hello to Dr. Rafael? Me? I'm off to the bean fields. I'm not interested in the old man. I need rest. I'm very grateful and I'm sure... Look who's coming. Another one I brought into the world. Dr. Rafael. Dr. Vicente. How are you? Sit down, have a liqueur. I've been with Alberto to the bean fields and decided to say hello. What about Alberto? Won't he come in? No, he wanted to go straight to the property. It's time to take the world's pulse. You and your B.B.C.! Damn it. This is awesome. I had forgotten... Good, let's go. Come on. Wait at the door. I'll be ready In just a minute. No, don't close the door. I can't see. Are you going to undress with the door open? Turn round. See if anyone's coming. Chiquinho! - Don't leave your post. - No one's coming. - Call that guy. - Guy no. My name is Manozinho. Whose coffee is this? It isn’t shelled or packed. It's no one's. It's just beans that have fallen for the kids to pick up. It's a tradition, the beans that fall are theirs. - What tradition! It's stealing. - I never stole anything. This land isn't yours, nor is this coffee. You don't know me. I'm poor but I'm honest. Is that what you call honest? Thieves and robbers, all of you. - No one calls me a thief. - Calm down, Manozinho. - How can I, if he's insulting me. - Keep calm. - Let's go before I hit this guy. - You'd better not try. Calm down, Alberto, let's go and meet Eusébio. Jesus, Mary and Joseph. As soon as I start work on that hole in Ribeira Filipe, if you... Look, Felisberto. I don't understand anything... You don't have to... You don't have to, as long as you let me work on your land which one day, in the future... Look here, you don't know. I've got family in Guiné. An ungrateful lot. - They never cared about me. - Never... and so cousin... I've decided to leave everything to the church. Ribeira Filipe too? Yes. Good morning. It's all arranged with Alberto. All we need is sign the deeds. Franck, who would believe it? That one day you'd move into the house of the great Medina da Veiga family. Oh yes... And if I wanted... I could move in today with all my family. - Eusébio. Does he agree to the sale? - Well, he has to. The house belongs to Alberto. I mean, did. Now, it's mine. And the shop? Eusébio can keep the shop if he likes, and pay rent, of course. You're trying to catch me out but I know the game. How's your hospital going? Same as ever, bursting at the seams. It was the same in my day, never enough beds, and what about in time of famines? I've got an idea. Let's get the people together and raise money. Not that I believe in charity, but perhaps if people realize the state we're in... You've got guts, but aren't you carrying this too far? Do you think I'm wrong, Dr. Rafael? No, on the contrary. I think it's a good idea and what's more you can count on me at the meeting. Franck and I, as you know, have reached an agreement about the sale of the estate. Yes, it's all arranged. We're agreed. Franck wanted to see the house. Upstairs. Especially the bedrooms, if Eusébio doesn't mind. I'll pay. - Don't worry. - It doesn't matter. Let's get down to brass tacks. If everyone helps the hospital will be a fit place. I've already told Dr. Vicente. I'll give the material for sheets. I'll help all I can. Anacleto, I'm glad I met you. I've just been to the Mosteiros and I'd like to talk to you. In the shop. I haven't got time now. I'm at a meeting of the commission. - There are matters I must deal with. - Commission! What commission? The hospital commission. Elected unanimously. Later. I'll fill you in on the decisions. Let's get back to what matters. We have set up a commission to gather donations. Bur first, we have to set up statutes to regulate the commission. - But is that really necessary? - Of course, absolutely. Thank goodness you're here. Dr. Vicente. Dear friends... You know there are important questions, like statutes which this commission is not competent to discuss. My friends, if I'm calling a meeting at the hospital it's not because I think charity solves everything. The problem is, that health is net a right for the people of this country. We have to ask their support because the government has driven the Hospital into such dire straits. There are no sheets, no shirts, no kitchen utensils and we have had to write to America and Dakar for help to buy an X-ray machine... - As for the damned statutes... I'm glad I met you, I'd like a chat. You could have saved me! Why? The man has money. He paid, he bought a house. He had the right to view it. But you said you wanted to keep the house for sentimental reasons. The country is backward. You can't get ahead. I'm investing this money in Lisbon: or do you think I'm going to spend the rest of my life ow-towing to petty officials? - You don't understand. These pieces of land belonged to our parents, our grandparents and go back in our family for generations. They all lived the way they wanted. Now it's our turn. Our turn to tear it down? To turn our back on our own country just for money? You still haven't understood. Times have changed. Get it over with then... ...and take our modern times with you. Now you're leaving, my life will be sadder. Everything has changed in just a few days. Is Lisbon very big? Too big sometimes. But do you miss it? It's my country. There are lots of things here there aren't there. Such as? Black sand. You reported Dr. Vicente to the secret Police! It was my patriotic duty. You're a grass. This has never happened in our family. I won't permit any son of a bitch, and a black one at that to ruin this country. You have no country, Felisberto. Do you know what he said at that Hospital meeting? He wasn't saying anything. It's all inventions. He was speaking against the Empire. What Empire! An Empire that allowed the hospital to fall into that state. He wanted to ask for money from America and Dakar. From the emigrants. He wanted to sell this country to foreigners. He wanted to ask for immigrants who were driven out by hunger and poverty from your wonderful country. And isn't that a disgrace? A disgrace! You're the one who should be ashamed. He's an ungrateful creature. Selling out his country. Where's the letter? I've already delivered it. You're mad! You informed on a good man. Dr. Vicente saved your daughter's life. Get out! But, Eusébio, you don't understand... Get out! I just need a mirror to comb my hair. Go and get me the photo of José Claudio's whaler. I want it here. The ship of my fate which is coming to the end of its journey. Good heavens, don't say that. I should be back again. Eusébio, Eusébio. What is it? What's happening? Soila wants Eusébio to go over. Mariquinha is very bad. - Mariquinha? - She's dying. I'll have to go to Contenda right away. - Shall I call Felisberto? - No, don't. Get me a horse. Quickly. Eusébio. How is she? Dr. Vicente was here preparing me for the worst. I don't know if she'll last the night. Sit down and rest. It comes to us all. - Have you eaten? - No, but don't worry about me. I'll get you some soup. The ship... ...my ship of fate. Leave me alone with her. What a night, Manuel! Wind from the East, Eusébio. Do you think Doctor is going to be long? - Yes. - How long? Just a minute. He'll see you now. Thank you, doctor. Come in. Sit down. I'm afraid I'm here on unpleasant business. In this profession we are prepared for everything. Well, yes, but this is not a matter of health. No? Well, you should look after your health. You seem to me to be breathing badly. In fact I have been feeling ill lately. It's my chest. Your chest, eh? I see. How's your blood pressure? Rather high. - Please undress. - What! Take your clothes off so as I can examine you. Everything. What about my trousers? Everything except your underpants. - Name? - Abilio Silva. - Age? - 45. - Married? - Yes, I have 3 children. - Profession? - Civil servant. Civil... servant... good. Sit down. Now breathe in... again. Let's check those reflexes. Move over. Let's have a look at your blood pressure. Give your arm... 15.8. Not very good for a man of your age. - Can I get dressed? - Yes. I can't find anything serious. You're probably overtired, not enough sleep, stress. That's natural, Dr. Vicente. I've just had a lot of work because of you. Because of me! Don't tell me. - That meeting at the hospital... - What! The meeting! We have more important things to think of, Inspector. It's not a laughing matter. It's very serious. I've received a complaint, you understand, that you are involved in subversive activities. Ah, not that I remember... Don't worry. Luckily it's not that serious. But take advice, you're young, you have your future before you... Don't get involved in politics. If that's all you've got to say... And what about my blood pressure? Herbal tea... and nothing on your conscience. That's the best remedy. ...made him undress! And not because he’s a police inspector. Completely naked! In his birthday suit. I heard he let him keep his underpants on. That Dr. Vicente is some man! It needs guts. You Eusébio. I didn't expect you so early. You look dreadful. I came to see how you are. Do you want something to eat? How's your leg? Has the bruise gone? It's not better. It's not worse. Just the same. - It doesn't matter? - Who says it doesn't matter? I went to Jambacoso. He said it was nothing to worry about. That quack isn't much good. Belinha, I've told you before. Go to Dr. Vicente. - If you insist. - I do insist. All right. I'll pass by the hospital and see the doctor. Don't you want anything? No, I'm not hungry. Belinha has leprosy. Leprosy, Dr. Vicente? - Are you sure? - I'm afraid so. Leprosy! It's only a benign form. Are you all right? Something is worrying me. Once I put my lips... ...to that mark, the mark she has. You needn't worry, Eusébio. - What she has isn't contagious. - No? However get yourself looked at. You can examine me now. She spent the day like this. Eusébio. Go. Well, Belinha, why are you so upset? Don't cry. It's not serious. I spoke to Dr. Vicente and he said it's a simple blood disorder. You'll be fine. It's the end Eusébio... ...the end. What end. I've told you... it's nothing serious. A horrible illness. I'm going to lose you... I'm going to lose you for ever. You're talking rubbish. I'm here. You've got to have treatment and... you can lead a normal life. So come to bed. Make love to me. Make love to me if it's so normal. I can't. You see. I'm repulsive. I'm sorry, Belinha. I'll help you. I'm tired. Go to the hospital. I'll come by tomorrow. You mean to say this half-baked Gestapo is at last spreading its poison on the Island? Half-baked is what you say... You know I've received a summons. As if I'd go... You should have seen their faces. They are contemptible. Anyway the case is over and it could have been worse. Yes, but because of suspicions you are in disgrace. - That doesn't matter, Dr. - What about your work? There will be someone to take my place. As for me... there's so much to be done on these islands... this colony. Don't say colony. Say overseas province. - This is part of Portugal. - You don't really believe that? Whether it's a colony or a province, the truth is it is being exploited. The normal process of capitalism. Please don't come here with your ideas. It's not capitalism. It's general looting. What is going to happen to this country? Tell me that. Look at the Veiga children. Money in their hands and off they go to Lisbon. - Except Eusébio. - Yes, but that's different. Let's see if he can take it. And as for you, my dear colleague, be careful. Wherever you go, you are a marked man. They'll never leave you in peace. They take the doctor and leave the ailment. What ailment, Dr? Disease, accusation, suspicion, fear. Fear, Dr. Vicente. - Chiquinho, you're early. - I do as I like. Chiquinho, wait! I must talk to you. I've decided to leave. There's nothing to keep us here. Tomorrow we go to Contenda Island. We do? Yes. Get your things together. We leave tomorrow morning. - I'm not going. - What? I've told you. I'm not going with you. What a crazy idea. We have everything we need there. It's too small, life is boring. What do you know about that? Nothing. I don't want to be a farmer. But we have nothing left. We've sold everything. The island is our last resort. That's up to you. It's not my life. Your...? Your life? I want to find myself. See new horizons. And find my place there. Chiquinho! Time to say good-bye, my friends. I don't know what's worse, losing the doctor, a friend or a singer. It's my loss. I leave you part of my heart. Come on, my friends. I'm going to say goodbye to the town. How are you? I'm fine, but I've got problems. Go and rest, tell me later if I can help... Just as it was in my mother's day! These celebrations must show everyone who we are, the Medina da Veiga. Eusébio, my son, we will carry the banner of St. Phillip this year which is no mean thing. I haven't felt so peaceful for a long time. Here everything falls into place here. I was going to tell you tonight the dinner is here. I guessed right. - Chiquinho has left. - What did you expect? I don't know. I just know everything fell to pieces... Nothing stands. Even Chiquinho has gone. He's gone way. You've come back. There are different times, Eusébio. Different times... What do you know about such things? It's like after the storm. Nothing stands... but the world doesn't stop going round. It has to fulfil its destiny for those who love it, understand it. It's a great responsibility you're laying on my shoulders. I came back because I had to. I don't know if I'm capable of more. But I don't know whether I'm able to save the island. You can, yes you knew you can and I'm here. I've always been here.
