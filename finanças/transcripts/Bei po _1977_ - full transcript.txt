(dramatic music) (waves roar) (Wei-lung gags) (Shao-san sighs) (Shao-san coughs) - Wei-lung where are we? - At sea. (Chai-yun groans) (somber music) - Wei-lung, we've been here for days. I just can't stand it. Help me. Push me in. - Shao-san, no matter what, at least we're free now, and the wind, we can't be far from land. We won't give up so easy. We've had our one big chance, so let's use it. - We're right out to sea. We've no chance. We've little food. There's no water. We'll die, die here. - Shao-san! (dramatic music) (Chai-yun gags) Drink it slowly then. - Look! ("Going the Distance") (Wei-lung grunts) (men grunt) (Chai-yun shrieks) Well, we've been here for a year now. Tried many jobs, but we're still low paid workers. - What do you want? We're real lucky. We're still here. - Luck, luck, you see that big ship? It belongs to my boss, Mr. Pow. He's Chinese, and he owns a lot of ships like that. He's pretty rich. He's rolling in money, and we're both so goddam poor. This isn't paradise. - Patience. We're still young yet. Maybe our chance will come soon. Mr. Pow, he's successful now. But still, when he was younger, who knows what problems he had then. - Wei-lung, I guess you're right, but still, I wish the future would hurry up. (both laugh) Hey, got some things to do. See you later. - Okay. (upbeat music) (Shao-san whistles) (Shao-san hums) - Wei-lung, get up, or you'll be late, hurry! (head thuds) (Wei-lung grunts) Hurry, did you hear me? (quirky music) - Huh? Shao-san, Shao-san! (Chai-yun shrieks) Shao-san, where have my clothes gone? (Shao-san laughs) - Your clothes? I don't know, sorry (laughs). - Goodness sakes, hurry up. It's getting late now. Come on, let's go. - Yeah. - Hey! (Shao-san whistles) Shao-san, you must know where my clothes are! - Hey, sorry, but it's my turn to take her out. They're there. - Hey. (door thuds) - Real absent-minded. (Shao-san laughs) - Shao-san, wait for me! - Goodbye. - Hey! (quirky music) (torch crackles) (machine rattles) Shao-san, Shao-san, listen, something wrong with my engine. - I'm busy now. - Hey, help me out. Come on, come on. - All right. - Here. - We'd make money out of this deal with Chin, but delivery, we've got just two days. (Peter grunts) Black bastard! Grab him! (men grunt) (fist thuds) (men grunt) (fists thud) (fist thuds) (foot thuds) (fist thuds) (fist thuds) (Wei-lung grunts) - Why do you bully him? (Peter grunts) - Who is this man? - What's with you? - When grown men beat up a young kid, I can't stand it. - That right? (Peter grunts) (fist thuds) (men grunt) (fist thuds) (men grunt) (foot thuds) (man in tie groans) (foot thuds) (Wei-lung yells) (foot smacks) (men grunt) (foot thuds) (fist thuds) (foot thuds) (fist thuds) (foot smacks) (men grunt) (foot thuds) (fist thuds) (man in tie groans) (foot thuds) (Wei-lung grunts) (foot thuds) (Wei-lung grunts) (fist thuds) (dramatic music) (Peter groans) (phone rings) - Yeah. - [Man] Boss, Petey was beaten up, and he's in the hospital. - Huh? Who did it? - [Man] We don't know. We're checking on it. - All right, I'll go see him. - You can fight pretty good. You live in Hong Kong? - Well, my old lady's working in the consulate, and I learned some karate. You be my teacher, huh, teach me a bit of kung fu? - All right. - Good (laughs). (men laugh) Hey, like this one, huh. When you did this, huh, I dig it. - Hey! - Hey! - [Wei-lung] You okay? Be careful, you'll hurt yourself. - You lost your job to fighting. How you gonna live? Got any ideas? (Tom groans) - As long as I can work, I'll survive. - What's more, Saturday, I'm going racing, may win a fortune. (Chai-yun sighs) - Right, change clothes. - Huh? - Let's go practice. - Yeah? Okay. - Come on (laughs). (hand smacks) (fist thuds) Again. (men grunt) (leg smacks) (Tom grunts) (Tom gags) You learn defense before you attack, hmm? - Yeah, got it, right on. - Right. Hi-yah, hi-yah! (Wei-lung grunts) Ha! (hands smack) (stick whips) Now what you gonna do? (Tom grunts) (Wei-lung grunts) Use your bare hands against a weapon, and you'll get hurt. (hand smacks) (Tom grunts) - Ooh, so what do I do now, brother, huh? - Here. (stick clatters) (stick thuds) (Tom grunts) Right. (stick clatters) (Tom groans) You can use anything at all as a weapon, you see, I mean, like this rock. (Tom grunts) (foot smacks) (Tom groans) (stick clatters) Tom, Tom, you okay? Hey, hey. (fist thuds) (both grunt) - Hey, man, are you okay? - Never get scared or you'll lose. (head thuds) (Tom groans) All right, want to rest? - You're the greatest. (Wei-lung laughs) (chain rattles) These fighting stick things, these look real cool, man. Show me how to use 'em. (chain rattles) (Wei-lung grunts) (sticks whip) (Wei-lung grunts) (jug clatters) (stick thuds) Hey! (Chai-yun shrieks) - Hmm, the bar just called you. You got the job. To celebrate, I brought watermelons. Now, look. - It's all right. I got a job. When I'm paid, I'll buy 10. - Man, those sticks are really something else. - Now, look, don't get in trouble with your kung fu. (exciting music) (men laugh) - Hey, you! Hey, nigger, boy. Hey, kid. - [Tom] What do you want? - The last time that Chinese guy helped you out. Well, now, you black bastard, we'll see. - [Man With Mustache] Yeah, that's right! - I warn you. - Yeah, warn us (laughs)! - So you want to fight us? (fist thuds) - Yeah! - I'll fight you! - Oh, fight us? (men laugh) - [Both] Come on! - [Man With Mustache] Come on, kid, come and get it. (fist thuds) (men grunt) (foot thuds) (fist thuds) (foot thuds) (fist thuds) (foot thuds) (man grunts) (foot thuds) (fist thuds) (man gags) (fist thuds) (Tom chuckles) (upbeat club music) - Have a seat here. Now what'll you drink? - Oh, you know, anything. - Right, (speaks in foreign language), please, ah, and two nice girls, huh. - No problem. (Shi Po laughs) - Peter, you really suffered in that beating at your job, and I feel bad about that. So tonight, you're gonna enjoy yourself. - No, no, no, no, no. (Shi Po laughs) Very nice of you. (girls giggle) - Hi! Hello there, hi. - Oh, hello, Mr. Chin. - Peter, this is Amy, and this is Dora. - Hello. - Seems your car business is doing quite well. The thing to do is bring in a lot of old engines and paint them up. There's a pile of money in that. (Shi Po laughs) You'll make a good profit, all right (laughs). - That's him! This is the punk that beat me up! - Well, want some more? - Ah, you! - Peter, you don't want to start a fight in public. Come on, relax. - [Dora] We'll be all right. - Relax. - Hai Sheng, that young guy, you sort him out. - [Hai Sheng] Right. - Come on, relax. You're with Mr. Chin now. He can handle any problem at all. - Relax. - Everything will be all right. - Come on, let's have a drink, shall we? Come on. - Enjoy yourself, come on. (Wei-lung grunts) - Hey, man, you finished? - Yeah. - I've been waiting for hours. - [Wei-lung] What for, huh? You got a problem? - [Tom] You're right. I got some bad news today. - [Wei-lung] What was that? - [Tom] I got canned. - [Wei-lung] Huh, why? - [Tom] Oh, 'cause of that fight on the wharf. - Tom, I'm sorry. That was my fault. - Huh? Now, look, up 'til now, I've been fired five times and not for anything I've done. It's the world. It's unfair, always will be, but that's how it is, man, huh? (Wei-lung laughs) - Well, now, hungry? - Right on. (sinister music) - What do you want? - I want your leg. (Wei-lung chuckles) - And who do you work for? - Mr. Chin. You annoyed him. He didn't like that. - I annoyed him? He annoyed me. (Wei-lung grunts) Huh? Let go. - I told you. I want your leg. (Wei-lung yells) (fist thuds) (man gags) (foot thuds) (fist thuds) (foot thuds) (henchman grunts) (foot smacks) (men grunt) (foot smacks) (fist thuds) (knife clatters) (foot thuds) (fist thuds) - [Tom] Man, you're great. (club thuds) (foot smacks) (club clatters) (foot thuds) (henchman groans) - You all right? - Sure. - Come on. - Even if you're good, you've two fists. How many can you fight? In Hong Kong, there's far too much violence and not much justice. - I (grunts). - Hmm, when you fight, I get worried. - Not my fault. I don't start the fight. Even if I hide, they'll still find me. - Be more patient. Keep your temper. - No, 'cause that just makes 'em worse. We just got to fight back. (machine hums) (Shao-san whistles) - Hi, Shao-san, how's the horses? - Lousy, just dropped a bundle. - That's too bad. - Dammit. - Hey, there's no point in bawlin'. That's how it goes. I got a good tip. You want it? - Again? I can't. - Hey, I'll tell ya. This is a hot one. Number six, race two, it'll walk it. You put your shirt on it, all right. You buyin'? - That's 450. - [Man With Paper] Okay, thanks, man. Thanks, hey, what do you want? - 500 bucks, number six, race two. - Right. Listen, the guy over there, he's betting 500. He never bet so big. (bald man gasps) - Too late, delay it off. Tell him no. - Fine. - Goddammit. - Sorry, sir, book's closed. - Hey, what do you mean? There's five minutes to go. I had to sneak away from the job to put this bet on. - I said we're closed. I'm sorry about that. - You can't refuse it. Now, come on. - [Bookie] Look, the bookings closed and that's that. It's too bad. - Hey, he said no. Take it somewhere else. - Who are you then? Get lost. Are you taking it? - Boss said no. - Call your boss. - Look here, the boss said no. - Hey, hey. - Hey, I'm warning you. (men grunt) - Hello. Hey, boss, there's a stranger in here who's giving us some trouble. - [Shi Po] Okay, now pass the word around to all the other places. - Okay, I will. (fist thuds) (men grunt) (fist thuds) (Shao-san yells) (henchman groans) (fist thuds) (henchman screams) (men grunt) (foot thuds) (fist thuds) (henchman grunts) (elbow thuds) (fist thuds) (henchman yells) (fist thuds) (fist thuds) - Hey, what do you want? This is the ladies here. (fist thuds) (henchman groans) - Wei-lung, go to bed. You have to work early. - I've been reading this book. It set me thinking. - Bruce Lee? (Wei-lung grunts) (Chai-yun scoffs) - He went too far too quickly. That's why he died so early in life. - But he still made his mark, though. Chinese kung fu was made famous by him. I only wish I could be as successful as him. - I don't. - Why not? - Nothing, I'm just scared if you were, you'd forget me. They all say in Hong Kong, men change a lot. - People always change. They have to. It's part of life. But still, the friendship we have, I'm sure that won't change. - [Boss] Hi, Wei-lung. - Hi, boss. Hi there. - No need to change clothes. Those fellows you quarreled with, they've been to see the boss. And the boss told me that guys like you are bad for business. Sorry, better find another job. (Wei-lung scoffs) Please. (Wei-lung scoffs) (dramatic music) - You busted up my main place, and I had to close my other places for the whole night. We lost 200 grand. - So what? They asked for it. Shouldn't have turned me down. But to the point, what do you want? (Shi Po chuckles) - You're still young. You see things simply in black and white, but still, there is a problem, which we must solve. - It's done, that's that. It can't be changed. - Yes, yes, yes, but still the fact does remain because of you, money was lost. Therefore, the question of damages remains to be settled, hmm? Mr. Wong, what do you say? - $33, 333, to be paid right away. - You're crazy! - Hau Long, that's too much. You'll have to be more reasonable. Come down a bit. - Well, all right. I'll accept 3,333, the minimum. - Look, I'm broke. You'll have to sue me. I'll fight it out. - Ah, all right, then, that's what you want? Get him! - Right! (Shao-shan grunts) - Hey! Nothing can be settled like this. Let's just leave it. In time, we'll work it out. (Shao-shan chuckles) (henchman grunts) Hau Long. - Yeah. - That guy needs a lesson. See that he gets it. - Right. - Go on. (dramatic music) - Hey. - Hmm? - Shao-san, it's time to leave. - I want to finish this first. You go on, huh. - All right, good show, see you. (footsteps clatter) (intense music) (Shao-san gasps) - Heh, you cocky, little bastard, it's about time you learn some manners. Right, get him! (men grunts) (sticks clack) (men grunt) (sticks clack) (foot thuds) (boxes clatter) (fist thuds) (fist thuds) (Shao-san grunts) (metal clangs) (Shao-san grunts) (Wei-lung and Tom laugh) (men grunt) (fist thuds) (Wei-lung screams) (Wei-lung grunts) (Tom grunts) (fist thuds) (men grunt) (fist thuds) (foot thuds) (fist thuds) (men grunt) - Come on, let's go. (henchmen groan) - Come on, come on, come on. Get him! Go on, get on with it! (fast dramatic music) Get him! (foot smacks) (Wei-lung grunts) (fist thuds) (foot smacks) (Shao-san grunts) (foot thuds) (Shao-san grunts) (Tom grunts) (head thuds) (metal clatters) (Shao-san screams) - Hi-Yah! (Shao-san grunts) (henchman yells) (fist thuds) (hand thuds) (Wei-lung screams) (Shao-san screams) (stick clangs) (henchman groans) (Wei-lung screams) (foot thuds) (men grunt) - [Tom] Hey, you! (men grunt) (fist thuds) - Go on, fight him! Go on! - Huh? (stick whips) (fist thuds) (stick clatters) (Wei-lung screams) (dramatic music) (Hao Long moans) (Shao-san screams) (Hao Long whimpers) (breath hisses) (Hao Long sighs) - The fact that you got beat doesn't matter. But we'll lose face if the word gets around. (Hao Long chuckles weakly) I accept those kids are tough. But I still want to know why I keep you on! What's the use? - Sorry, we ain't got no rooms. You try somewhere else. (Chai-yun groans) - It's your fighting that's done this. You've no home now. Still want to fight? - I shall fight, just as long as I've got my fists. Hmm, hmm. (dramatic music) (arms smack) (foot smacks) (fighter groans) - One, two, three, four, five. (whistle shrills) (fist thuds) (fighters grunt) (fist thuds) (knee thuds) (whistle shrills) (upbeat music) - Those contests are dangerous. They scare me. - Come on, it's less dangerous than floating at sea like we did once. We weren't scared then, although we had no control. In a contest, one does have control. So then, it's just a matter of determination and the application of courage and skill. Chai-yun, you give me confidence. (upbeat music) Listen, we'll get married if I win the contest. All right? Tomorrow's your birthday. We'll get engaged then. (men grunt) (arms smack) (Gu Chang groans) - The worst thing is to defend and not attack. - Hi-yah! (arms smack) (Gu Chang groans) (Shi Po grunts) (fist thuds) One can accept an aggressive defense but to attack is always best. (Gu Chang grunts) (arms smack) (Shi Po yells) (Gu Chang pants) (Gu Chang grunts) (Shi Po grunts) (fist thuds) (fist thuds) - Teacher, you-- - Up! You can still fight back. So get up! (Gu Chang yells) (legs smack) Gu Chang, don't you know no such thing as a friendly fight. Only fools think that way. So hate your opponent every time. All of them will do their best to beat you. They'll do anything, use any trick. If you fight like that, hmm, they'll be carrying you out! You won't last one round. Now don't you ever forget. These contests are dangerous. Remember, always protect your weak points. That's where your opponent will be aiming. And that's where you have to aim at, right. I'll show you. (Gu Chang growls) (Gu Chang yells) (foot thuds) (Gu Chang groans) I exposed myself but simply to trick you. My counter was deliberately off the mark, or else you'd be dead by now. Try again. (Gu Chang grunts) (Shi Po grunts) (Shi Po yells) Your kick has no power, and worse, it's not vicious. You've got to get to the groin. Remember, anyone you fight is your deadly enemy. Anything goes. (Gu Chang grunts) (somber music) - Look at that beautiful ring. Chai-yun would love it. - See the price? 5,000 bucks. - If I had it, I reckon I'd go and get it for her. - You got 300 bucks, what can you get with that? So let's go to the races. If you are lucky, you could buy Chai-yun that ring. - But still, what if I should lose, though? - You can't go in there with just 300 bucks. You just can't. - And why can't I? - Well, you can go, by yourself. - Can I help you, sir? - You got any rings for less than 300. - Yeah. Here, here's one. - Hmm. - It isn't too bad, and it's cheap. - I'll take it. Put it in a nice box, though, will you? - Aye. ("Happy Birthday") (all laugh) - It's for you. (Chai-yun giggles) (Chai-yun gasps) - So pretty and expensive. - Wei-lung, put it on her. - Right, go on. She's waiting. (slow dance music) Hey, right on, let's dance, sweets, come on. - Sao-San, what is all this? - Hai, she loves you. She deserves it. I had some luck. Won a small lottery, and I bought the ring. It's got your name on it. - You better go alone now. Listen, you mustn't fail. You've got to win. - Sure. (Shi Po grunts) - The Thai boys and the Japs and Koreans should pose no problem. But there is one, and that is Wong Wei-lung. You really must watch him. He's very tough. He has no particular technique, but he fights rather like Bruce Lee. He's the biggest danger that you'll face. But you have got to beat him. Don't let me down. - Right. ("Going the Distance") - Wei-lung, the name of Chinese kung fu rests with you. (engine roars) ("Going the Distance") (crowd cheers) (whistle shrills) (fighters grunt) (arms smack) (fist thuds) (arms smack) (fist thuds) (fist thuds) (crowd cheers) (Wei-lung grunts) (foot thuds) - [Referee] One, two, three, four. (whistle shrills) (fist thuds) (foot smacks) One, two, three, four. Okay, come on. (whistle shrills) (fist thuds) (fist thuds) (foot thuds) One, two, three, four, five. (crowd cheers) - Well, good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome here. This is ABC bringing you live coverage of this tremendous international karate championship here tonight. We have here Wong Wei-lung and, of course, Gu Chang. (fighters grunt) (arms smack) (Gu Chang yells) (arms smack) (foot thuds) (fist thuds) (foot thuds) (Wei-lung yells) (crowd cheers) (triumphant music) - Wei-lung, it looks like you're going to win a lot of money at kung fu. How do you feel? - Ah, I'm just lucky. - People say you're a second Bruce Lee. How do you like that? - Bruce Lee created a new technique, and he's the Chinese that I most admire. His death was a great loss, great pity. But I know this. That is, Chinese kung fu can still develop. And I shall do all I can to try and achieve this. - To what school of gung fu do you think you belong? (Wei-lung snickers) - Well, it's a bit difficult to say. One thing I can say and that is development can only come, like Bruce Lee said, through a scientifically applied approach to kung fu. (television clicks) (ominous music) (men grunt) (sticks clack) (foot thuds) (fighters grunt) (fist thuds) (black belt fighter grunts) - Get the jugs. - [Student] Right. (students grunts) (black belt fighter grunts) (jug clatters) (black belt fighter grunts) (jug clatters) (black belt fighter screams) (jug clatters) (ominous music) (men grunt) (Western fighter grunts) (fist thuds) (water splashes) (fist thuds) (water splashes) (Lee grunts) (branch pops) (Shi Po chuckles) - Teacher Lee, I'll practice now. (stick whips) (men grunt) (stick clacks) (hands smack) (stick crackles) (dramatic music) (stick clatters) (Shi Po chuckles) Well, you three fight well, I must admit. I would like to ask you to help me out with a small problem. And if you'd like to, then come with me. I may have further work for you in the future, and money will be no problem at all. (Shi Po chuckles) (dramatic music) (Tom grunts) (Shao-san chuckles) (arms smack) (Shao-san gasps) (arms smack) - Easy, easy. - You're learning fast. (Shao-san sights) I'll tell Wei. He'll like that. - Huh, really? (engine roars) ("Going the Distance") (engine revs) - [Chai-yun] You're just too famous now. I mean, soon as you get back, there's men waiting to challenge you. (Chai-yun sighs) How can you live like that? - I'll accept any challenge. I won't be beaten. - If you weren't champion, we could have a nice, quiet life. - Now look, in an average man's life, how many chances can he expect? And this is my chance. I must take it. (gentle music) (Wei-lung chuckles) (Chai-yun and Wei-lung laugh) (brakes squeal) - Hey! (Chai-yun screams) No, let me go! What do you want? No (grunts)! (Wei-lung grunts) (arms smack) (men grunt) (arms smack) (men grunt) (arms smack) (fist thuds) (men grunt) (Wei-lung yells) (Wei-lung grunts) (arms smack) Oh no! (hand smacks) (foot thuds) (men grunt) (arms smack) (feet thud) (Wei-lung gasps) (Wei-lung grunts) (fist thuds) (foot thuds) (men grunt) (foot smacks) (Lee grunts) (hand smack) (foot thuds) (Wei-lung grunts) (hands smack) (Wei-lung groans) (stick crackles) (Chai-yun grunts) No! (hand thuds) (Wei-lung groans) (Chai-yun screams) No, no! (men grunt) - Here I come. (Chai-yun screams) (Wei-lung screams) (Western fighter grunts) (Chai-yun grunts) (Western fighter screams) (dramatic music) (speaks in foreign language) (engine revs) (Chai-yun grunts) (Chai-yun screams) (dramatic music) - Wei-lung, Chai-yun has died. (Wei-lung gasps) And you're hurt bad. They say you may never fight again. - Now, Wei-lung, you're a young man. Your life's still in front of you. You must be strong. Now I have a villa in the country. You can live there when you leave here. You'll have to take it easy for a long time here. (somber music) (horn bellows) (Wei-lung sighs) - Mr. Wong, I assure you I know how you feel, but you must trust the police. For 10 years, we've all been doing our best to pin something on to Chin Shi Po, but there's nothing we can do because of lack of evidence. We'll investigate this all we can. We may get somewhere, but still, that all takes time. - I can't wait! Chin Shi Po's a killer. Chai-yun's murdered. (knocking at door) Isn't that evidence enough? - Come in. It's not as simple as you make it sound. She was killed by a car. If it was Chin's car, how'd you prove it? And also, how'd you prove he was driving? Your injuries, can you prove that it was him or his men? Before we move, we must have some proof. Now we will do everything we can, that I assure you. But you got to have patience. It takes time. - Time, time! You wait too long, and there's gonna be another Chai-yun murdered! (somber music) (Wei-lung groans) - [Shao-san] Hey! - Leave me! I'll be all right. - Doctor said you shouldn't move. - No, I can move and get strong. Practice my kung fu. My hands, they're all right. The damn swine. She was just a young girl. How could they do it? She may be dead, but they're gonna pay! (weights clatter) - Wei-lung, what's the point of all this? Chin has lots of men, and he's rich. What can you do by yourself? - If a man wants, there's nothing that he can't do. I'll tell you this. To get revenge, if it takes all my life. I've one technique. It can beat him, Iron Finger. (dramatic music) (Wei-lung grunts) (spring rattles) (Wei-lung grunts) (Wei-lung grunts) (dummy beeps) (upbeat music) - [Bartender] Drink this here. - Hey, buy me a drink? Hey. - [Singer] I know what I'm talking about. I lost one of those, 'cause I didn't see it. ♪ Hey, there's always another girl ♪ - Well, are you alone? Feeling lonely? ♪ There's always another girl ♪ ♪ To change your lucky world again ♪ ♪ Only if you allow the night to go further ♪ (Shao-san grunts) (Dora giggles) Now just relax and enjoy yourself. And don't look so sad. Come on, let's dance, huh? - Can't dance. - Come on, just hold me. Come on, huh? ♪ There is always another girl ♪ ♪ To change your lucky world again ♪ ♪ Only if you allow the night to go further ♪ ♪ You will see another lover ♪ - Those guys want me. - They're Chin's men. Come with me. - Right. (people scream) - [Dora] Come on, quick. (Shao-san pants) (men grunt) (Dora screams) (arms smack) (stick thuds) (fist thuds) (Dora screams) (fist thuds) (fist thuds) (henchman groans) (fist thuds) (men grunt) (fist thuds) (henchman screams) (fist thuds) (foot thuds) (fists thud) (foot thuds) (henchman groans) (fist thuds) (Shao-san screams) (henchman groans) (fist thuds) (henchmen groan) - [Dora] Hurry, quick! (footsteps clatter) (romantic music) - What's your name? - Dora. - Why help me? - I wanted to. (Shao-san chuckles) - Tell me, you're not scared of those guys? - Hmm, nothing scares me. Why should they, huh? - This your place? - You like it, huh? - What's your job? - Bar girl. Hey, what are you waiting for, huh? Hurry up and have a bath. You're covered in sweat now. Oh God, go on! (Dora giggles) (Dora laughs) (Shao-san whistles) And what? You think I've never seen one? - You, what do you want? - Why can't I come in? It's my place. (Shao-san gasps) (lips smack) (Shao-san pants) (Dora moans) (lips smack) (Dora gasps) (weights clatter) (Wei-lung sighs) (machine hums) (Wei-lung grunts) (machine buzzes) (Wei-lung grunts) (machine buzzes) (Wei-lung grunts) (machine buzzes) (dramatic music) - Wei-lung! (bottle clinks) (Wei-lung grunts) (bottle clinks) Huh? Hey, man, you hurt? - It's nothing. It'll pass. (Wei-lung chuckles) Hey, it's been days since I saw Shao-san. - Oh, he's busy. They tell me he's got himself a new chick. - Let's get some wine. (upbeat club music) - Hey. - Yes, sir. - Take 'em a bottle of wine. - [Waiter] Right. - I do like you. (Dora giggles) You are nice. - Hey, Miss, Mr. Chin's compliments. (Dora grunts) - You sent that drink, what for? (Shao-san grunts) (arms smack) - You really are fast. I think your fists could earn you quite a lot of money. Tsk, tsk, but still, don't use them here. We've had our misunderstandings. Now then let's forget them. You know, I respect you. Anything I can do, you just let me know, hmm? Check. Oh, right, if you like that girl, take her out of the bar, hmm. - So how come you know that guy? - He's often been to see me. - You seem to like him. - He's a rich man. I have to smile at him. I've got to make a living. - Dora, you stop this work. Let's get married. - Married? - Yeah. - Hey, got a house? Got a car? Any bank accounts? - No. - Hmm. Hey, Shao-san, I do want to marry, but we need money. I want to have a nice wedding. I have to go. Think about it, huh? (engine revs) (dramatic music) (bottle clinks) (Wei-lung yells) (glass clatters) (Wei-lung yells) (glass clatters) - Great stuff, man. (glass clatters) - Again! (glass clatters) (Wei-lung yells) (glass clatters) - Teacher. - Hey, Shao-san. - Hi there. - Where have you been all this while? It's been ages. - Sorry about that. I'll introduce you. This is my girlfriend, Dora. (Wei-lung grunts) - Hi. Remember me, hmm? - Hong Kong's a small place. How are you? How's things going? - You know each other? - We worked in the same place. - Shao-san, let's have a practice. - No, not now. Something I must discuss. Hey, let's go in. (Dora spits) - Well, all right, what is it? Let's hear it. - I need some money. - Is it your gambling? In debt? - No, something else. - [Wei-lung] 10 grand? - Twice that. - Well, that's a lot. What for? - To get married. - Married to who? - Dora. - Do you know what she is? - I know. She's a bar girl. - Well, how can you marry a bar girl? - I love her! - Now look, how can you love a girl like that? - Enough! Is it yes or no? - Listen, we're alone, no family, and we've been just like brothers. In this case, I've a right to speak out. - No use talking. You won't help me. Mean bastard! (fist thuds) - You! (Shao-san grunts) (dramatic music) Shao-san, Shao-san! Shao-san! (dramatic music) - Had a fight? Hey, well, tell me. About money? (Shao-san sighs) (Dora grunts) When you want money, you find out who your friends are. And there aren't too many. So he won't help you. You got great friends, I must say. And he won a lot through his fighting, didn't he? (Dora grunts) (engine revs) (dominoes clack) - [Man] I'm in, I'm in! - Goddammit, I can't win. - Hey, I'm cleaned out. - [Dealer] You can have 2,000 bucks credit. - Thanks. - Hey, I'll take the same. - Who are you? - Never mind. You've given him. - Who guarantees you? - Well, I do. - Well, I'm sorry friend. - I do. - Oh, Mr. Chin's player. Give him the money. Let him have it. - [Short Dealer] Sure, there you are. Okay, bets! Come on. (dominoes clack) (Shao-san gasps) (Hai Sheng grunts) (dominoes clack) - [Short Dealer] Hey, listen, don't go yet. Check your tiles. - Nothing! - Hey, listen, give it a rest. Your luck's out. It's no use. Come on, let's go and have a drink, huh? - Well, what's your opinion about his kung fu skills? - I think your three best men together couldn't beat him, not a chance. - Oh? And me, then? Do you think he could beat me? - Well, your bedroom kung fu is better than his. But still, in fighting, that I wouldn't know. - Oh? (Shi Po laughs) You're a real bitch. (Dora giggles) Now practice your technique. Let's see how good you are, hmm. - I'll surprise you. (lips smack) (Dora grunts) (Shi Po laughs) (somber music) - Chai-yun, I promise, I'm going to avenge you. (men grunt) (man yells) (intense music) (men grunt) Get out! It's him I want. Out!

He killed Lin and three of his men. Boss, what'll we do? - Hey, what's wrong? - Boss, boss? - So that bastard's come back.

We all change in this damn place. - After all, it's a hard world. You ought to know that. - How much did they pay you? - Does it matter? It was enough. I promise you. Now I don't particularly want to do this. But if I don't do it, someone will. - Shao-san, you-- - Wong Wei-lung, we were friends but no longer. (Wei-lung gasps) (Shao-san grunts) - Hold it! I won't fight you! (Shao-san yells) (arms smack) (hand thuds) (fist thuds) Enough. - I told you. I'll fight you!
