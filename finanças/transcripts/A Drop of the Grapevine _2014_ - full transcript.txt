A Drop of the Grapevine. Yo Oizumi. Yuko Ando. Shota Someya Music by: Yaskawa Nooro Directed by: Yukiko Mishima Brother. Brother, how are the grapes today? The fruits are growing beautifully. It's still early. Babette, we'll wait a little longer before having our meal. The roasting is done. You're welcome. Why don't you have some wine too? I don't drink. Why? I've told you many times, I dislike grape wine. You little brat. By the way, I also dislike drunkards. What's that? Probably a traveler. Looks like they're heading this way. Hmm. Hello? Hello? Hello? Stop? Hmm. It's a woman. Yes. What is she doing there? What is that person doing? What are you doing? I'm asking you. Stop digging. This field is for growing wine grapes. Grapes are very fragile. Don't dig randomly. I'm working hard to make wine here. Can you hear me? This isn't your land, right? What did you say? I must be here. I won't bother you. You'll get dirt all over you. You, wait and see! They say you're causing trouble. We have a strange woman next to us, digging holes randomly. Definitely suspicious. Please come over quickly. Scrambled eggs or omelette? Mr. Asahi. Mr. Asahi. Hey, Roku. Understood. Should we dig together with her? cheers. Cheers? Did you hear them say cheers? Or was it just my imagination? Maybe it's Mr. Asahi's strategy. cheers. Sorry for keeping you waiting. To... Report to Teacher Ao. Miss Erika, no problems at all. Erika? is her name. It's nice to have dreams. She saved money and traveled around, all the way here. Let her do what she wants to do. What? I had a few too many drinks and feel a bit drunk. After a hard day's work, it's always good to have a drink. Then I'll stop here for today. Mr. Asahi, you've had too much to drink. What dreams, exactly? Stop joking around. What dreams are you talking about? You think you're a real police officer? cheers… Mr. Asahi, let's go inside. Babbette, hurry and call. What's going on? Aren't you the watchdog? Do your duty properly. Babbette, Babbette! Babette! Babette, you're calling Babbette, huh? So adorable! You're amazing! Want to come to my house? Come in quickly. Babette. Did you find something while digging? Great, keep going. You're such a good girl. Are you helping me dig? Babette. What's wrong? Babbette isn't in the kennel. My brother said he might be here. Oh, so that annoying guy is your brother. You have a big age difference. We're one generation apart. It hurts. It's okay, it's okay. This is for you. Thank you. By the way, can you do me a favor? It's delicious! Really? Smells great. Smells great! Mail has arrived. - How's it going? - Not bad. Hey, I'm back. Hello, everyone. I smell pancakes being cooked. This person is a peculiar mailman. I'm Sukiori. Mr. Sukiori, join in and help. Sure. Pass this over. I brought red wine today, but I can't guarantee the taste. Is that so? Here are your glasses. In the end, Roku's wheat is the best. My family has been growing wheat since my father's generation. Hmm? What about over there? That's Ao's. He suddenly said he wanted to make wine. He did it all by himself? About five years ago. Suddenly. With that expression. Yes, that expression. But my father also grew a grapevine. Really? Yeah, on that one. That's a grapevine? But I still prefer wheat. I really love the sight of my father standing in the wheat field. That's true. Wheat fields in summer are incredibly beautiful, swaying in the breeze, golden and radiant. Just seeing that scene makes me tear up with gratitude. That's exactly it. But well, people can't survive on bread alone, right? Exactly, let's have a drink. Sure. okay Here you go. Roku, I poured one for you too. I won't drink. I'll have this. milk? Really? Drinking milk? It's okay. Okay then. Cheers. Cheers. No peeking! Oh my. Don't casually drink someone else's wine. Are you angry? I only borrowed a little. Alright, there's plenty here. There's so much. Why is that person looking so unhappy? Exactly. But stealing is not a good thing to do. That's true. You Liqing, 29 years old, appointed as permanent conductor You've changed, though. Where have I changed? Your face. Faces don't change. They do change. Before, you were truly a tough guy. Let's not talk about my father. Like Charles Bronson. Why didn't you come back? I wish I could show him this face at Lao Jie's funeral. What are you doing? Why do you keep displaying my father's photo? And my grandfather's too. Perhaps during my grandfather's time, there were many active coal mines. Nowadays, hardly anyone lives here, right? Everything changes. Coal is like black diamonds. Shiny black, reflecting light. That's Pinot Noir. When Pinot Noir reflects sunlight, it looks like a black diamond. Black diamonds are coal. Black diamonds are coal. Some things don't change. We can't stay unchanged. Dad, I want to leave home and study music seriously. Look up, the sky is vast. You can study music anywhere. Dad, do you know where my awards are? I can't find them anywhere. Those things are useless. Did you throw them away? Isn't that going too far? It's too much. You're the one who taught me music. I just taught you harmonica, that's all. Harmonica is legitimate music too. You're still too naive. Without surviving, everything is just talk. I don't want to live like you, covered in dirt. I'd rather not live like that. Brother, Brother. Brother, Dad, stop him. elder brother Brother, listen to me, Xiaolu. Brother, Brother... Brother, Brother... Sorry for bothering you. It's okay, go ahead. Dad really liked the harmonica. He didn't like alcohol, probably never tasted wine. When you were born, he touched your little brother several times said with a smile, 'The champion of the land is born.' The way you stood in the wheat field was exactly like Dad. Hey. Hey. My Pinot Noir! It's you, huh? Hahaha isn't that great? What? It's delicious, your Pinot Noir grapes. Because animals don't lie. Do you know how much effort each grape costs me? It's fine, just a little bit. Give it a little. Give it a little? I don't want it. Hahaha I'll give you a bit. This is the wine I made. Can I have some? Sure. It still has that earthy taste. Yeah, no matter what, it still has that earthy taste. Or you can say it's a rustic flavor. Is it not good this way? Completely lacking in refinement. It will become even tastier after it sits for a while. Roku, is your name "青" (green) in "青天" (blue sky)? Yes. It's my younger brother's name. Written as "绿" (green) but pronounced "roku." Who named him? My dad did. Ao and Roku, huh? Your dad must have loved this place a lot. He passed away eight years ago. Compared to the ever-changing sky, I prefer the land. Millions of years ago, sea creatures lived here. The land is teeming with life, going through cycles of life and death. Isn't that the way of things? Yes, it is. But I still wonder why we can't obtain the things we desire the most. Is what you want buried in the ground? Ammonites? I'm collecting them. Nice. Next time, show me other ammonites, okay? Sure. Can I come in? Yes. It's quite dark. During fermentation, it must be kept in the dark. My mom said even in the warehouse, it should have a little light coming in. I want to see the wine in the light, it's just right. Transparency, color, that's how you can tell. How is your name, Erika, written? In katakana. Who named you? My mom did. She grew up in England. Not many people in Japan probably know the name Erika. It also means "wilderness" in French. Quite audacious, huh? Your mom is also an eccentric person. Don't compare me to her; I've even forgotten what she looks like. As long as she's alive, that's enough As long as she's alive, perhaps things can still change. That's what it means to be alive. Yeah. I like them the most. As grapes, they have to die once before being reborn as wine. Changing form, getting a new life. The grapes for wine grow better in wastelands. Cheers to the harvest. Cheers to the harvest. This is Lili. Cheers. I'll start eating. Go ahead. Thank you. It's delicious, really delicious. So tender. I'm so full. You're really good at cooking. Thank you. As a token of gratitude, I'm giving you this. Oh, fantastic. It's woven from white birch bark. Lili is talented in everything. Asahi, I won't be giving birth, you know. Hahaha I'll do my best. I'm already 50 years old. Alright, alright. There will be opportunities. I haven't even found a wife yet. Alright, alright. You might find it difficult in this lifetime. I've always had unrequited love. Uh, is it me? Is it me? I like manly men. Yes. Hahaha. Everything is here. There's blue sky, green trees, and the land. Also, good men. Erika, I brought the furnace. Erika. I'm opening the door. Roku. I've heard that playing music for grapevines is beneficial, it will surely enhance the flavor. Stop for a moment. This is a complete disaster. The melody is completely out of tune. Ao, maybe you haven't noticed, but since you returned here, you haven't smiled once. Do you really think we're that inadequate in your eyes? I am happy, really. I'm so annoyed. Leave me alone. When I had a high fever, Asahi brought me lots of ice cubes, Lily taught me how to play the xylophone, and Tsukino helped me chop firewood. Did you know about these? so what? Just take it back. What defines good wine? It's subjective for each person, I suppose As long as there are many wines for us to choose from, it's good enough. Oh, by the way, let's go meet the manly man. Sure. Go straight along this path. Okay. welcome. Hello. How about giving her a haircut? Me? Please come this way. Cut it here? here? A little longer. here? A little longer. Miura, take off your socks. Huh? Look, there's a big hole in your socks. This is… It's a great photo, isn't it? Everyone is excited and proud of him. Me too. But he suddenly suffered from sudden deafness. And then, after coming back, he suddenly said he wants to make grape wine. What's wrong with him? We don't really understand. We all thought Roku would help him. But that kid always remains silent. Although it's tough for those who leave home to make a living, It's even harder for those who stay behind. Erika, be a good kid, okay? Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Dad. When will Mom come back? To twenty-year-old Erika, The sky in London today is filled with gray clouds and thick fog. A fine drizzle is still falling. I recently learned that your father passed away four years ago, And you suffered a lot because of that person. Now I have the ability to live with you. Perhaps it's just wishful thinking on my part, But I want to be the strength you can rely on. After I return to Japan, let's live together. I will prepare your room. Even if it's just once, I want to see you, Rieko Kishida. This won't do. Why just sit here doing nothing? What am I doing, really? I don't even know if I can find it. I don't dislike the rain. But I hate when it suddenly rains on a beautiful day. I was just thinking how beautiful the sky is today, But then, raindrops as big as beans started falling, pattering on my face. There's absolutely no worse time than this. I'm all covered in mud. Alright. You can come to my place and take a shower. I'll go boil some water first. Hey. Thanks. Sure, feel free to use the bathroom. May catch a cold. That was a refreshing shower. Do you always have wine on your mind? In winter, grapevines sleep silently under the snow. But when spring comes, They absorb the melting snowwater, And a drop of water drips from the tiny vine branches. People call that drop of water the grape's tear. When I see it, I can't help but marvel, "The grapevine is finally awake." You can use my bathroom anytime from now on. Thank you. Erika. My brother said he wants to open a barrel of newly made wine. Brother, please stop. Brother, that's enough. Brother, please stop. what do you want? What do you really want? tell me. what do you want? what do you want? tell me? what do you want? At least have something to eat. Just do better next year. It's worse than before. Is the soil here not suitable for it? That's not possible. How would you know? What do you understand? I threw it away I threw them into the Ashinabechi River. Dad silently jumped into the river, And I picked them up one by one, wiping them clean. Too quiet. That room, Although it used to house four people, Mom passed away, Brother left home, Dad also left. Do you understand? Too quiet to bear. That's why I started playing the xylophone. Brother, why didn't you come back? when Dad left Why didn't you come back? Answer me, please. Please cut it here. Cut it here, sharply and cleanly. Brother. Erika's car is gone; i brought her here. Sorry for bothering you. I'm not here to see you today. I want you to lend me money, or it's still a work in progress. But I want to finish making this wine no matter what. Where was it brewed? Sorachi? Sorachi? Many ammonite fossils are sleeping there. When I was searching for them, met a fool. Can I taste it? It has a strong earthy flavor; that's its charm. I remember When I said I wanted to name you Erika that person strongly objected. Because the name's meaning is "wasteland." no, it means a flower blooming in the wasteland. Like the beautiful Andromeda that can bloom pink flowers even in minus 20 degrees, it feels like a dream. You still love soil, don't you? You haven't changed. Even a wine with an earthy smell will turn into a fine wine with time. Mom, Mom! Mom, Mom! Erika here's something nice for you. Long, long ago, there lived an ammonite in a certain place. Ammonite, it's so beautiful. This is a gift from Miss Erika for you. She asked me to use the locally grown oak tree for this. And this, the grapevine has even grown here. You really fought hard, struggling to find nourishment in the soil. Will Miss Erika not come back? I've decided. I've made my decision. It's been such a long time; I'm really sorry. I got a letter. Thank you for taking care of Ao. I'm sorry, I have a request. Give... Thanks. The last barrel. The final one. Come, the last one. Everyone has worked hard. I feel that this year the grape's color has become very soft and beautiful. To Ao. Please go and see in the pit I dug, Then you will know how hard the grape tree fights to survive. I think that soil represents the accumulation of life, The grape tree strives to take root in the soil and draw everything towards the sky. Please believe in the power of the soil and the plants that live in it, Guard them, even for billions of years, Then they will surely bear the best fruit they can. I feel that wine has carried many tears since a long, long time ago, Your tears of joy, tears of pain, Those tears will turn into the taste of fine wine, The tears that you have turned into wine with your own hands, Will surely be experienced by someone a hundred years later. Go and make the unique wine of Sorachi Erika. It's the tears of the grape, ah, It has the taste of this land. Mascagni: Rustic Chivalry It's still early, it's still early. I'm becoming more and more like my father. Rustic Chivalry. I have listened to your performance once and shed tears, I admire you from the bottom of my heart. But for me, the wheat fields are more important than music. The soft light falls from the clouds, and the gentle breeze caresses the face, All the anxiety in my heart dissipates. Give me a drink. Brother, winemaking is not suitable for you. Hmm, not suitable? What do you know? I won't give up. The ammonite spent billions of years underground, now it's back in the daylight. Billions of years? Can you wait? Yes, I can wait for billions of years. It tastes really bad. You don't know how to drink wine. It's very self-centered and stubborn. But this wine also has the passion of a fool and the taste of a clear sky. I like the taste of this wine. It's still early. I didn't expect it would be so easy to find you with this. cheers. cheers. Wait a moment. It has a strong earthy smell. Don't finish it all. This is a Pinot Noir, you know. Give it back to me. ＜Sorachi Winery＞ < Tears of the Grape > Cheers to everything here. Cheers.
