Ye ye ni ni ni! Mister S Mister S Mister S Mister S You always find us, Mister S I don't know how you do it I'm sorry, but once again You won't get us You run so many experiments in your lab What did you put in that slime? I don't know, but it's hard like this You keep coming after us Ooh oh oh It's a mystery How you never leave a trace Ooh oh oh, ooh oh oh We're ready for This match will be challenging Run as fast as you can And we will prevail This match isn't over We are the ones who never give up, never Mister S Mister S Mister S Mister S To… Sofì. -Pongo, where are we at? -Everything's ready, sir. Let the end of Me contro Te commence! Hi, everyone, and welcome to the most anticipated event of the year, the Like Award, which I'll have the honor to present. Children of the world, I'll be awarding your favorite character on this stage tomorrow! The candidates are the ones you voted for, and we summoned them here with the famous yellow invitation. Those who've received the invitation dream of winning the Like Award! But only one will win. Who will it be? We'll find out tomorrow! Together! Luì, come here. Luì? Luì? Where has he gone? Luì, what are you doing? What is that? I'm trying out the idea for today's video. Take these. How to make a spy disguise. What have spies got to do with it now? I enrolled in an online school. Everyone dreams of being a spy. Not me. Idea rejected. You can't decide everything! Luì, is this the right time to argue? -No. -There you go. Let's do as I say. Idea rejected. No spies. We have more important things to think of. What are you doing now? I am a Mexican shrub, yeah! Luì, don't you get it? I'm not in the mood for laughing. You're nervous about the Like Award, right? Correct. There's only one day left, and we haven't received the yellow invitation yet. It's fine. The postal service might be late. What if it wasn't for that? Maybe we didn't get the invitation because no one voted for us. Maybe we'll never get it. Nah, that's impossible. I don't know, Luì. All I know is if we don't win, we'll let Team Trouts down. Don't worry. Do like I do. Don't think about it, and it will be todo bien! Luì, you're impossible! Every time we have a problem, you just think of having fun. It's a relaxation technique. The only valid technique is to face the problem strategically and rationally. Meaning what? Meaning that we'll list everything we can do to get our prize. No. No lists. Yes, a list. First of all, we'll have to create a killer video. Then we'll have to take pictures, write posts, give interviews… No. I'm stressed out just thinking about it. Let me have a glass of water. What are you doing? Plants drink through the roots, right? Listen to me. Forget about your lists, relax, and you'll see that when you least expect it, the invitation will come. It's you, Mrs. Marisa. Hello, guys. May I come in? -Of course-- -Not! We're recording today's video. Team Trouts expects it every day. -You know? -I know it well. I never miss them. I'm your number one fan! And your next-door neighbor. Ye ye ye ni ni ni ni! Wow! We thought we only had fans… How can I put it… a little younger. And why is that? Well, in our videos, we talk to an audience that is clearly… That is clearly me! -Yes. -Isn't it? Yes. Well, guys, unfortunately, I have to go now. I'm going to my club to meet my retired friends. Do you know what we'll do? What? A Slim Challenger, blindfolded. Do you mean you do a Slime Challenge? Obviously. Am I or am I not your number one fan? You're so nice. Thank you! Ye ye ni ni ni ni ni! -You're beautiful. I love you. Bye. -Thank you so much. -Ni ni ni ni ni! -Bye, Little Trout. Ni ni ni ni ni! I haven't forgotten, you know. Now it's time to make our list! But first, go and get changed. I feel like I'm talking to a hedge. Thank you. A spy hedge! Ta-da! The list! That's not a list. That's madness! Yes, indeed there are many things to do. But first, today's video! How to create a dress that changes according to the situation you're in, thanks to a remote control that I bought online. Was that remote control flat, silver, and rectangular? -That's right. Did you see it? -No. Luì? Did you destroy it? Not exactly. I incorporated it into the best spy disguise ever realized! Which will make me invisible. I can still see you! Are you trying to fight? Yes, because you never take anything seriously. And you take everything too seriously. Are we fighting? We have different views. We are too different. You're not thinking about splitting up? I had to come in because I heard what sounded like a fight. But you weren't fighting, right? -Hello? Postal service. -Yes! -Come in. -Yes, it's for us. You must be new. I've never seen you around. Yes. It's my first day. What a strange guy. Just like this purple envelope which says, "Leek Avard." -Wasn't it meant to be yellow? -Yes. Anyway, it's for us. I'll open it. -No. -I'll open it. No. I'll open it. Let's see what it says… "The award…" "The kids…" It's almost time. I have to go. The thing! Have we been nominated for the award? They only invited you! How is this possible? "The children want you to stay apart for a while." They want to separate us? It's 2:00 p.m.! This is why Mrs. Marisa left in a rush. It's time for our video. But we don't have a video to upload. It never happened before. Luì… What if Team Trouts is right? Maybe it really is time to take a break from each other. I'd have never thought this could happen to us. And yet, it's happening. I have to accept it. Maybe there are positive sides to being on your own. No more fights. Everything becomes easier and quicker. Leave. It's great to be on your own after all. It really might be time to break up for a while. Also, if this wasn't the case, someone would stop me. Proceed. Help! I have the house all to myself, and I'm free to do what I want. No one tells me what to do or how to do it. No one tells me anything. Because I've got no one to talk to. She didn't even give me the time to apologize. I should have stopped her. She couldn't have gone far. Sofì! Oh boy. Where am I? But that is… Slime. And who are you? I am the formidable Professor Cattivius. Oh dear. I'm so scared. Yes, exactly. You're right. I am scary. Because I am-- Our assistant. Not very clever, but extremely ambitious. Nice to meet you. I'm Perfidia. Why am I here? What do you want from me? Turn it on. Hey! Spectrum. The only slime that can make you happy when you touch it. Created by my super powerful and super smart boss. It makes you happy? How is it possible? Secret recipe by Mister-- Shut up! You little snot. My name is Professor Cattivius. "My name is Professor Cattivius." What did I say? The Spectrum will make all the children in the world happy. And this is why my boss deserves the Like Award more than you or anyone else. Don't you think? Well, if this is really what this Spectrum does, then it truly sounds like a brilliant invention. But I am not sure about your boss at all. He uses criminal methods. What's happening now? Mister S? Exactly, my dear. Since when do you care about children? I don't care at all. I for one hate children, but I love the popularity they'll give me, and most of all, everything that will follow. What will follow? Oh, you'll find out when it's too late. You will never win the Like Award. I will stop you. And how, if you will stay here forever? Actually, I didn't think about that. Help! Can you hear me? Of course! Luì will be looking for me. Yes. Any minute now, he will get here with all of his spy gear, and he'll rescue me. Yes, I can imagine him crashing in here, and… And nothing. We'll both be prisoners. It could have been worse. We're tied in a cage in Mister S's lab, while he steals our award, deceives the whole Trouts Team, and threatens that something worse will follow… How could it be worse? Well, you could have been alone. I wish I was. "I'm Perfidia, and everyone's jealous of me." I am the number one assistant of Mister S. I, the meanest. I, the formidable Professor Cattivius. Pongo! Humble servant, little simpleton, ready to be quiet! Welcome, Luì. You're in time for the award ceremony. My award ceremony. It will never happen. No children will vote for you! Yes, they will. The children of the world, of all five continents. And you know why? -Pongo! -Yes. Right away. Hello, everyone. He is Luì. And she is Sofì. And together we are Me contro Te. What kind of joke is that? How is it possible that we are there if we're here? I mean, we're here but also there. Gosh, I don't know where I am anymore. What are they? Two clones. Obedient to Mister S and skillfully designed by me, the genius. My masterpiece. What's happening? It looks like they're having some programming issues. He looks nothing like me. He can't do anything right, that Pongo! We want to give you the slime that will let you have a super fun time. Here it is. Mister S's Spectrum. The only slime that will have you laugh your heads off. You are happy, right? Then vote for Mister S to be the Like Award winner. You can't do this! You're using our faces to persuade them to vote for you. And steal your prize. Exactly. And not only that. You'll also help me with what will follow. What will follow? Why are you talking in riddles? What is your real plan? Goodbye. Luì, we have to get out of here. I have an idea. We'll go on the count of three. -No! -One, two, three! I told you it wasn't a good idea. At least the head is out. Hello, Professor Cattivius. Has anyone ever told you that you have nice… shoes? You little fools. You're not going anywhere. Come on. Let's rehearse our lines for the video. Remember those lines you learned to convince the children? -We are Me contro Te. -We want to give you the slime. Yes, those ones! You'll learn them in each language of the five continents, and we'll record a video for each continent. Understood? No. Stay right here, and stop with that-- Piles of circuit created in the image and likeness of that simpleton. Sir, we're almost ready to record the videos. I knew you wouldn't disappoint me, Perfidia. Oh. Sir, may I remind you that I designed the clones. Shut up, you little simpleton! But sir, you should be praising m… You're lucky enough to be here! What do I always tell you? "It's better to have a master than to be alone." Well done. And now, shut up. Let me enjoy the show. Come on, Sofì. Quick! Could you be quiet? Do you have another one in your pocket? I am a girl with manicured nails, not a ninja. Okay, no problem. I've got an idea. That's terrifying. No, that's telekinesis. Look at me opening the door. -Open up. -Luì, it'll never work. Let me concentrate. -Open up. -I can't believe it. Yes! -Open up. Come on, door. Open up. -I can't believe it. -I beg you. Open up. -Yes. Come on. I know you want to open up. We're nearly there. Open up. Come on. I beg you, please. Gently. Open up. Come on. Sweet little door, coochie coo. Come on, open up. Open up. Yes! Did you see? I've opened it using telekinesis. What are you doing there? It's a long story. Come on. There's no time to waste. -Let's get out of here. -That way. No. That way. That hatch door leads outside. And how do you know that? Am I or am I not a spy? Let's go that way. See, it's always your way! Of course! You think you opened the door with your mind. It's called telekinesis! Yes, "It's called telekinesis." Let's go that way. No, I want to go that way. Luì, why did you come here? Why? Don't thank me if I worry about you. Nobody asked you to. You know what? Goodbye! Bye! I'm sure without you, it'll be easier to get out of this nightmare! Wow! Oops. We're even. We must get out of here. We need an idea. Think. The stick. Of course! I'll give it a try. I'm an old wise man. Who are you? The Old Wise Man. The OId Wise Man? Wow. I can't believe it! What an honor. Thank you for showing up. This time, we're really doomed. Can you tell us which hatch door will lead us out alive? Obviously not. What? Can you tell us what Mister S's real plan is? What does he mean when he says, "What will follow"? Obviously not. But why? I'll tell you something more important. You travel faster alone but further together. Forget it. This guy is crazy. No, Luì. He's not crazy. He said something important. Wow! He said that only by joining forces we'll be able to escape. So, let's make a deal. We'll help each other get out here, and then we'll split up forever, okay? Deal. Truce? No. It's just a temporary truce. Ye ye ni ni ni ni! Ready to record the video in Eskimo. Three, two, one. Action! Stop! Come back here! Come immediately-- No, I beg you. I swear I'll strangle that idiot who designed you! Who are you strangling? Strangling? No, I said "stroking." I want to stroke these guys because they're so special. But, I'm sorry, who are you? Marisa, the neighbor. As well as the number one fan! Ye ye ye ni ni ni ni ni! -But who are you? -Me? Well, you see, I'm actually here to… to help the guys… To help them make peace? -Exactly. To help them make peace. -Well done. How are you, guys? Are you okay? Yes, they're perfectly fine. But you see, ma'am, they need to record a video now. They're very busy. They look weird. Are you sure they are okay? They're just fine. They're great. Goodbye, ma'am. Bye. Action! Bravo, Perfidia! No one can barge in on my genius plan. We want to give you the slime that will make you laugh your head off. Are you happy? Then vote for Mister S to be the only winner of the Like Award. And now… What did she say? "Let's dance together." It's Eskimo. I'm learning it at spy school. Anyway, I don't understand how they can believe that's me. Don't you see? What do you mean? She can't dance. She's gawky. Sofì, you're not exactly a ballerina. I'm sorry. Are you trying to say that I can't dance? Not at all, if compared to a herd of buffalo. Crippled ones. Is that right? Look what I can do! What's happening? Mister S has started conquering the world with his Spectrum! The children from the North Pole voted for him. Luì, we must get out of here. Let's go that way! Rock, paper, scissors! Let's go that way. How heavy is this hatch door? Wow! What is this place? A letter? "If you want to conquer freedom, you need to earn it." "Dance. Mwahahaha." Signed, "Mister S." And now it's your turn. No. I am not dancing. -But didn't you read the letter? -I know what I'm doing. I'm not dancing. -Sofì. -I'm not in the mood. The walls are moving! -You have to dance! -But I can't dance! Just dance! What are you doing? You're so uncoordinated! Luì, it's too fast! I can't keep up! Have fun, or it won't work! -This is so stressful! Luì, you dance. -Why? Because you know how to relax and have fun no matter what! Dance, please! -I know you can do it better than me! -Okay. Yes. Well done, Luì. Okay. It's working! Keep going. Yes. Okay. This one here. Bravo! Wow! It worked! Say it. Thank you. And then? Without you, I couldn't have made it. And so… I'm sorry. Okay. We can go. Oh no. He fooled us! We're trapped like rats. No! The Spectrum has conquered Asia too. They voted for that cheater! Behold the results of your video in Asia. Stop watching these Me contro Te. Did you do your homework? The great evil plan is in your hands. Do you think it's all about the award? No! There's so much more! What are you doing? Did you fall asleep? Reactivate immediately! No, not like this. Stupid fools! We still have to shoot the video for Africa! We also have that brat there… You, little brat, play with the slime. And you can rehearse your lines. I can't stand happy kids. Hey, dude. Smile less. Yes. That's good. Hey, no! What are you doing? How many times do I have to tell you not to eat this? You have to memorize what's written on it! No, wait here. Where are you going? Stop! I'll tear you to pieces! Good evening. I'll tear you to pieces with kisses. The door was open and I-- Yes. It's all good, dear. But you see, they have to shoot another video with this very sweet little boy. What a scoop! What will it be about? Well, you'll find out soon, together with all the other… Tunas. -Did you mean Trouts? -Yes, Trouts, right. Ni ni ni ni ni ni! I am curious. You're too curious, ma'am! And you should stop it! Please. Ready to shoot, worthless pile of scrap? No, don't cry yet! No, come on. Hold it in. Smile, come on. Come on. Let's hurry up! Three, two, one… Action! Hello, everyone. -He's Luì. -And she's Sofì. Together we are -Me contro Te. -Me contro Te. We want to give you the slime that will make you laugh your head off. Are you happy? Then vote for Mister S to be the only winner of the Like Award. And now… What did she say? I can't decipher this language. "Let's dance together." How do you know? I studied Swahili at elementary school. Really? No, Luì! They're dancing. I guess they'll have to say it in all the languages of the world. Poor kid, he looks so sad. Of course he is. Perfidia is a harpy. Don't you find it strange how he went from being happy to being so sad? Think about it. Professor Cattivius! Let's go back to the cage! Let's go! Run! Professor Cattivius Without Perfidia around It'd be much better Mister S Africa voted for Mister S too. It's late at night and everything is good. And you, you shouldn't have gone looking for her. Right now, you'd be home, in bed, happy. I'm happier here. "I'm happier here." Sure. It's never worth sacrificing yourself for your friends. She is my girlfriend. Even if we are taking a break. You see? Not the slightest appreciation. She'll leave you all alone. "It's better to have a master than to be alone." He didn't notice anything. Wait a minute… This lab is falling apart. Let me see. Well, it's so narrow that no one could fit through it. That's right. Absolutely no one. But I'll fix it anyway. -He left. Shall we follow him? -You go. "You travel further together." You're right. Let's follow him together. Where has he gone? I can't see him anymore. -He must have climbed up that way. -Are you sure? It's so dark. Relax. They trained me to do as bats do. What do you mean? Even though they can't see, bats can sense obstacles by reflected sound waves. Ouch! If I talk and walk, the sound precedes me, hits the obstacle, and comes back to warn-- Ouch! Everything's under control. We're almost there. Oh no! Where did we end up? Another letter! "Don't fret, or you'll burn. "Use your head. Mwahahaha." Signed, "Mister S." "Use your head…" Does it mean we should walk upside-down? I don't think that's what he meant. What's happening now? I don't know, but I can see the exit over there. We have to go over the wires, and we'll be out. Luì, wait. Don't you think the floor is getting hotter? You're not wrong at all! "Don't fret or you'll burn…" Of course! It's like a lava floor. Every time we touch a wire, the floor gets hotter. We must run! Let's get out of here! -Run! -No! Stop, Luì! Calm down. Strategy and rationality. You have to think about each movement, make a mental list. A mental list? Do I look like a mental list person? Sofì, I need you. You're the queen of lists! I have to go right, then left… I go straight for three wires… And then again to the left. I go through. Down. And then right again. I work out the angle, base times height… Again, to the right… And then I go down. And yes, I should be able to make it. I'll try. Be careful. Don't touch the wires! Watch that wire! You're doing great! Okay. Come on. You're almost there. The floor is getting hotter! Come on, Sofì. Hurry up! And… Ta-da! Yes! The floor's cooled down. The hatch door's open. We've officially passed the test. Let's go. Yes, but first, I'll show you a bit of my strategy and rationality, with a pinch of gracefulness. All I have to do is go up here-- No! Let's walk under. Let's take a bow-- Nope. Let's go under. Ouch. And let's do a little skip of strategy and a pirouette. And let's moonwalk. And let's go under… Sofì. I lost sight of my strategy. Would you give me a hand? -Let's go. -Okay. Slowly. Yes. Yes. Here we are. I'm sure this hatch door will lead us out. Oh no! Look who's trying to flee on the day of the Like Award? I'm starting to think that Mister S will get the award. The children of half of the world already voted for him. This slime is amazing! I can't stop laughing! -As usual, we're in trouble and you laugh. -It's not my fault. -I can't focus! -Well, you should focus. We still haven't found out what Mister S means with "What will follow." What's his real plan? We'll never make it. Hey. What's got into you? I have the right to lose heart too, right? No. That's not you. And only a minute ago you were laughing. There's something weird about this slime. Could it have something to do with Mister S's real plan? I can't stand happy kids. The carousel! They're at the fair! Where the award ceremony will soon take place. So, ready to shoot the video for America? No! You ride it the other way around! You have to turn around! Go back to your position immediately! Come on. Let's shoot. Action. -We want to give you the slime-- -Stop! You say your lines from the beginning! Is that clear? From the beginning! I'm sorry, ma'am, what shall I do? I'm bored. First of all, go back to your position right now. Secondly, you have to stop eating this junk food! And thirdly, keep pretending you're American! Useless puppet! And now, let's dance together. No! Get off me. Keep your hands off of me! No child in the world will ever laugh again. America's gone too. Four continents out of five voted for him. I'm feeling anxious. We must hurry! Look! That kid is sad too. He's holding the Spectrum, so he should be happy. It's not a coincidence. I told you. There's something weird about this slime. I think Mister S is hiding a more evil plan than simply stealing our prize. I mean, your prize. Don't you think? Yes. Mister S said the same thing. Wow! You would be an amazing spy! -Are you sure you're not interested? -Very sure. It's the right way! How do you know? -At my spy school-- -Okay, I don't want to know. All clear! Look! We're below the fair! Mister S is clever. He built his lab exactly below the place of the Like Award ceremony. Well, it's a pity someone will soon ruin his plan. The tunnel divides here. Let's go… that way! -First, we need to stop Perfidia! -No. First, we have to stop the clones. Do you really want to fight now? Luì, I don't want to fight. But maybe we don't understand each other anymore. Actually, at this point, we don't need to be together anymore. We always have different ideas. We fight about everything… And even Team Trouts want to see us apart. Remember? So we should go separate ways… Good luck. Obviously, I don't agree with this decision. Hello, everyone. He is Luì. And she is Luì. And she is Sofì. Are you ready for the destruction? I mean, for the ceremony. It's only a few hours away. Sir, everything is ready. You're the most voted nominee. The prize is officially yours. We're only waiting for your arrival at the fair. Great! But as you know, what interests me the most is what will follow. So it's essential that all the brats on earth get the Spectrum. I think Europe's missing. Maybe Perfidia's failing. I think all newsstands and toy shops have sold out. Bravo! So, this leaves only the children at the fair. Is that correct? They'll get it from those idiots shortly. I meant the clones. When the last children of the world get the Spectrum, my vengeance will be complete. Useless pile of scraps. You're here too. Oh yes… No point pretending I can be without my beloved guys. I love them. They're so cute, my babies. So beautiful! I have to go now. I'm playing. I'm playing as a DJ. Finally! That's amazing! Go, ma'am. Go. I'm free! Luì! Help! Sofì? Luì, help me! Come save me! Luì, help me! Luì! Luì, help me! Where are you? I'm here! Is this the time to take a slime bath? What slime bath! I went through a hatch door, and I ended up here! Now I don't know how to get out. Luì, you have to help me! But how? What do I do? I don't know! Do something! Hurry up, Luì! The slime is rising! Try to pull that lever! Pull it! This one! Okay, calm down, Luì. Think. What would Sofì do? She'd use her head. Strategy and rationality. She'd work out the impact area, the glass thickness, the slime density, the pressure on the hatch door… and… Sofì! Sofì! -She'll drown! -That's even better! And when I have separated them forever, it will be easier to carry out my vendetta against the children of the world! Sofì, I don't know what to do! I'm not like you. I'm clumsy! Sofì! Wake up! I need you. I won't moan about your lists. I'll do what you want. But please, don't leave me. Luì! You saved me! You came back for me! I'd do it a thousand times again. I'm so sorry for all the bad things we said to each other, and for thinking that we could break up. Actually… there is no me without you. Because we are one. We are Me contro Te. Cry, you little simpleton. Because it's your fault. It's always your fault! I cry because I wish I had friends like them. Friends… Being on your own without useless baggage, that is the secret of a successful life! And no one would want a friend like you anyway. You're a disappointment! And now… let's put an end to Me contro Te! Nothing! This one is closed as well! We're stuck in here. Mister S will win! Look. The world's almost totally dark. And most importantly, it's sad. Just how I like it. That's what will follow! -Mister S? -Mister S? All the children in the world will be sad forever! I knew you plotted something more evil than stealing the Like Award! The award is just an excuse! What I really want is to steal children's happiness. The Spectrum is an invention to steal happiness, isn't it? That's right. In the beginning, it makes you laugh. Then it transfers the happiness of whoever touches it here. That's crazy! Shortly, it will be completely dark. When the last children get the Spectrum, then my plan will be complete. And it will be irreversible! The children at the fair! Exactly! And then, no child will laugh ever again. Sad, isn't it? Shame you won't be able to tell this to anyone. Goodbye, Me contro Te. It's better to have good friends than a powerful master. You are our friend? Can I? Of course! Thank you! Sorry. I'm too excited. Is he… dead? No. No worries. He's just fainted. This is our chance to find out who Mister S is! Who's going to lift the cloak? You're the best person for the job. You aren't scared, are you? Are you or are you not a spy? Okay. How is it possible? He's disappeared! He ran away! Do you really think you could defeat me? Nothing can hinder the success of my evil plan! What's happening? Everything's falling! It's the lab's self-destruct system! Let's run. This way! Which way shall we go? Keep going straight, guys. I know a shortcut! It's so windy in here. Hello, everyone! And welcome! Hello, everyone, and welcome to the most anticipated event of the year, the Like Award! -Yes, we're out! -Wait. Where's the professor? -I'm stuck. Help! -Give me your hand! Okay. Come on. Let's go! Let's go! Hey, wait for me! Oh my! That's Mister S's headquarters, designed to detach from the rest of the lab and lift off when needed. Don't worry, sir. No one can stop what will follow. Neither can you, my dear TV host. Help! -So, was it easy to find the exit? -It's easy now because we're friends. -Right? -Sure, Professor Cattivius! No! My name is… Pongo. Will you mock me for this too as the kids did at school? Mock you? Why? The name suits you. It's a beautiful name! If I had another dog, I'd call him Pongo. Luì… I mean that I really like it. Welcome to the Like Award! Perfidia! She's presenting the show. It's the last thing she'll do, at least for today. Pongo's word! Let's go and stop her, the clones, and the sadness in the world. Wait for me! Unfortunately, the winner of our prize, our beloved Mister S, has had a setback and won't be with us, but he sends you a surprise… Me contro Te! Yes! Me contro Te! Hello, everyone. He is Luì. And she is Sofì. Together we are… Me contro Te. We have a gift for you. The Spectrum. You are the only children in the world who do not yet have the slime that will make you happy. -We have to stop them. -But how? With the remote. That's what turns the clones on and off. Exactly. The remote! We need to get it. So, as you would say, strategy and rationality. We climb up there, cut the rope which holds the projector, and let it fall… Luì, no need to climb. We're just a few steps from Perfidia. -We only need to approach her gently. -Clever! Do as I do. Follow me. Well? Aren't you coming? No need to crawl like worms either. We only need to tiptoe there. Let's go! It's a little amateurish, but it'll do. It's so cute. Wait for me! Do you want it? Yes! Please. Take Mister S's slime! It will let you have a super fun time! Me! Me! Take it! There's plenty! Me! Take it and pass it around to your friends. Go ahead and play! Do you feel the effect? Yes, come on! There's plenty! Mister S' slime. The Spectrum. Please, you can all have one. The slime that will let you have a super fun-- Hello, Mrs. or Miss Perfidia. Well, I mean, I would need… this! Give it! Give-- Leave it! I said leave it! I said leave it! I'll take care of this! Sofì, good girl, bring it to me now. Sofi! Bring it to me I said! Let's catch her! Excuse me. Not like that. You make me fall! Help! I have to go that way… I'm sorry. Excuse me. We can take pictures later. -Pictures later. -Give me that remote now! No! Luì! You take care of it! I'll take care of it! Yes, Luì! Where are you? I'm the winner! Yes! Bravo! -No! -I can't believe it… No! You're just two losers. Finally, Mister S's evil plan is about to play out! Come on. Give me that remote! No, Luì! Luì, honey, love. What are you doing? Now, take that remote off your mouth and give it to me. Did you understand what I said? Yes? There. Good boy. Now, give me that remote. I said give me that remote. No! Stupid pile of junk! You destroyed Mister S's plan! You idiots. The children are now feeling happy again because of you! You voided the power of the Spectrum by eating that remote! Perfidia! Get ready for teleportation. I want to vanish before I hear again that disgusting happy-kid laughter! Thank you, sir. Me contro Te, this time you won. But I'll be back, more evil than before! What's happening? Yes! Look at her, look. All tied up and gagged up. You girls always want to play. Come and see how good I am as a DJ! -Come! -I'm coming. Yes, but free me first! We did it. Together, we saved the world. I almost got the remote. I was this close. And here they are, the real Me contro Te! -Hi everyone. He is Luì. -And she is Sofì. And together we are Me contro Te. Remember the Spectrum, that slime they said will give you happiness? It was a lie. You can't find happiness in objects but in being together! Everyone knows that you travel faster alone… but further together. And we will go much further! Because on our side, we have you, Team Trouts! Me contro Te! -Ye ye ni ni ni! -Ye ye ni ni ni! And now, finally, we can give the Like Award to Me contro Te… Luì and Sofì! You don't need a fast car To overcome your problems Sometimes all you need Is having real friends by your side Sometimes it's tough I know But I know together we can make it Because if you like I can share with you all I have left And if you ever need me You know that I'll be with you In a heartbeat And I could walk all over the world After all, we don't need words And so take my hand Lock everything up and let's go Everywhere is home if you are with me For better or for worse We'll be in good company And so take my hand Because you travel faster alone But further together Eh-oh! Eh-oh! But further together, eh-oh! Eh-oh! You know you don't need a shuttle If you want to find your space Embrace that journey And listen to The Old Wise Man's advice We're different, I know But together we're like a show You know I'll be there no matter what And I won't ever say no to you And if you ever need me You know that I'll be with you In a heartbeat And I could walk all around the world After all, we don't need words And so, take my hand Lock everything up and let's go Everywhere is home if you are with me For better or for worse We'll be in good company And so, take my hand Because you travel faster alone But further together, eh-oh! Eh-oh! But further together, eh-oh! Eh-oh! And you know, whenever I am with you I can fly even if I'm not on a jet And I want to look at the sky I'm tired of looking at a cell -Hello? -And just like magic, here we are I wasn't expecting it Because you travel faster alone But further together Eh-oh! Eh-oh! But further together Eh-oh! Eh-oh! But further together Eh-oh! Eh-oh! But further together Eh-oh! Eh-oh!
