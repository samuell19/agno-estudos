Hiromi-ya Dobe Sansai ... Kadokura Heima Yokoyama ... Hamakawa By a vicious plot by Dobe and others, Yukinojo's parents were tormented to death. Before his death, his father asked Nakamura Kikunojo, an actor, to take care of his small son, Yukitaro. The father asked for vengeance on Dobe and his men also. Kikunojo promised and gave Yukitaro a new name Yukinojo and made him an actor. Kikunojo 14 years have passed. Yukitaro, now called Yukinojo, became a popular actor in Osaka. Yukinojo Dobe Sansai achieved political power in Edo by giving his daughter Namiji to the Shogun for his mistress. Namiji The conspirators, Hiromiya and Nagasakiya also became rich under Dobe, through their criminal acts. Yukinojo was invited by the Nakamura Theatre and came to Edo from Osaka. Now, the time has come. The 14 years endurance will be rewarded. The enemy is Dobe, but Yukinojo must be patient. Using Namiji's love for him, he can successfully enter Dobe's residence. Yukinojo was planning to make Dobe suffer by using Dobe's daughter Namiji, but an unexpected hindrance appeared, a female thief Ohatsu. Ohatsu Yamitaro At the same time, another strange man appeared, called Yamitaro. He sympathizes with Yukinojo and determines to help him. The story starts with Yukinojo coming backstage where many fans are waiting for him. Look! There he is! - How popular he is! - That is Yukinojo. The say the oyama, Yukinojo, wasn't born in Osaka. No, it is said he was born in Kyushu. So the master Kikunojo has known Yukinojo since childhood. They were living closely together. It is said the master taught him not only acting but other skills too. I heard he was taught swordplay also. It is said he was taught by Wakita Ichishosai, our sword master. I can't believe it. It's true. When Ichishosai sensei stayed in Osaka he gave Yukinojo training. Did our master teach him in Osaka? The acting master said, Yukinojo is as good as Kadojura or better. That's strange. He is just an actor. How could it be possible? Seats for Dobe Sansai-sama Who is she? That's the Lady Namiji-sama. Isn't she the mistress of Shogun-sama? Yes, as long as Lady Namiji-sama has Shogun-sama's favour no daimyo, hatamoro or important merchant can challenge Dobe Sansai-sama. I see. He's done well. It is said, when Sansai-sama was in the office of the Nagasaki magistrate... Look, the samurai on the right, is Hamakawa-sama. The next is Yokoyama-sama. The two officers conspired with the regular merchant... Look, the senior gentleman is Hiromiya-san, the other is Nagasakiya-san. It is said that Dobe-sama used these people and easily obtained a huge fortune by dubious means in Nagasaki, Kyushu. I see. Otherwise Hiromiya-san and Nagasakiya-san could never have got such a great fortune in so short a time. Hey, Muku, is that Nagasakiya sitting behind the lady? Yes. The next one is Hiromiya. He seems to have it. Have what? Some of this. Karuwaza, Ohatsu and Mukuinu. Father... Yukitaro, never forget those wicked men who took everything from your father by a vicious trap. Take revenge on them. Yukitaro. Father. Yukitaro, you must gain revenge for your father. Mother, its you. Yukitaro. When you were a small child your father always said that when you grow up you must succeed in this Matsuuraya shop and establish its reputation throughout the world. It was his wish. Nevertheless, the wicked Nagasakiya, our trusted employee... Yukitaro... you must gain revenge for your father. I will. All the enemies are in their seats now. Dobe, Hamakawa, Yokoyama and Hiromiya and Nagasakiya. Yukitaro. Mother, I know. I have lost my house, my father and my mother. Now I am to be an actor. Wait, my enemies. Master, do you feel ill? No. The onnagata. Yukinojo? I feel I have seen him somewhere. Yes, a long time ago. He looks like someone. I see, master. It was last night... Yamitaro? Yes, sir. Somehow similar. No. A long time ago. I feel it was a woman. I can't remember where I met her. Namiji-sama is smart, but she is a girl after all. She is fascinated by the Osaka actor. So quickly. So... Sir, the master is waiting. Leave us alone. Do you need me, sir? Tonight, Nagasakiya and Hiromiya invite you to Nagasakiya's villa in Negishi. This must be through the guidance of your late father. I don't think this is yet the time to be rash. You can go, but do not act in haste. Try to inquire and get behind the scenes. I give you a cup of sake. I was told that you are good at swordplay. No, sir. No, no, don't hide it. You are a fellow disciple of Kadokura Heigo here. Mine is just a copycat for my stage action. You speak well. Pass this cup to your senior disciple. - I decline, sir. - Why? I have to tolerate him in sword training but, he is just a low actor, how could I accept? Inflexible man. Excuse me, sir. My daughter gives too much favour to Yukinojo. I hope it is not getting serious, meanwhile, she needs some recreation. You are right, sir. I believe she is not stupid enough as to forget her name and standing. She is my important daughter. Her recreation must be done moderately. That is your responsibility. Certainly, sir. Well now... Every room is still lit up. Who is it? Who is it? Who's there? Me. Who? Enough. Me. I was fooled by the gentle voice. It's a man! You don't look like a member of this household. I am a thief. Be quiet. Someone may come. What are you going to do? I have nothing to do with this house, I'll set you free. go. If you have nothing to do with this house, why do you prevent me? You are Yuki from Nakamura Theatre. Don't bother about it. Go. You are Yukinojo of Nakamura Theatre. He's an actor. To be continued. See you tomorrow night. Police Hanamura I can't bear it anymore. I have to do it now, the five enemies, I... Don't you understand the master's advice to wait? If you kill Nagasakiya or Hiromiya with a single cut, it would be a mercy for them. Consider your father's long term suffering. You must give those five men the same suffering. But, master... Please try to guess my agony, having to talk with enemy Sansai's daughter and flattering her. I know. But the lady Namiji-sama is the most important lead to access your enemies, so you must bear it. If you rush and fail, what will you do? They are powerful men in the world. How could you get all of their heads? Wow, kill those powerful men? Who is it? It must be a thief. It doesn't matter. Go to sleep. You must appear on stage tomorrow. I want to see the top Hanamura star (tayu). A letter from someone, it's no regular fan. Walls have ears. Walls have ears. This must be discussed secretly. I need to talk to you tonight From a woman you know. You heard some nonsense. With that, you want to threaten me... You can't cheat me. I know who your enemies are. My mouth can destroy your plan, as well as your life. But I don't want to do that, as I have fallen in love with you unto death. Tayu, you must understand me. I understand. The play will be finished soon. After that we will meet again... What? I can't wait so long. You very well know in what world I live. I can't wait ten or twenty days. It's unreasonable. Is falling in love unreasonable? Tayu, I can't stop anymore. You can't stop? Oh, are you going to kill me? Don't. I was flirting with you like in a play, but don't get carried away. If a woman like me could be easily killed by a failure like you, I couldn't survive in my dark business. I said I'd help you because I fell in love, but you wasted my favour. Damn you! Failure. Do as you like. If you don't accept me I have something else to do. I'll go to shaven headed Sansai and tell him that the monster Yukinojo from Kamigata is... I am not a woman who begs god or a snake for help. Namiji-san ran away from home. Namiji-san ran away from home. The lady left a note and left. I told you, you idiot. Never show your faces again. I am ruined. Call Heima. We are so sorry, sir. Carrier, why should we take such a lonely path for visiting the villa of Nagasakiya-sama in Negishi? We are taking a short-cut. A short-cut? Down. A guest has arrived, what shall we do, sir? Well done. A seat is prepared there. Men, prepare. Yukinojo, come out. Yukinojo. What a careful reception! I have never got my footwear by myself. Carrier, give me my footwear. What? Take care for your head! I am scared of my head being cut off. But without footwear... Shut up! If you don't listen to me, I won't either. This sword is not just a threat. Of course not, you are a samurai. But you are afraid and that is why you prepared on such a large scale to receive a humble actor through a false letter. What? This is a very deliberate entertainment. Shut up! Just a sword-wielding entertainer? Don't forget who you are! For your honour tonight, we'll teach you a tough lesson so you'll not appear in Edo again. Did I disgrace you, sirs? And if so, how? You deceived the lady of a distinguished family and coaxed her out. The lady of a distinguished family? I won't mention the lady's name, but you must know. No, sir. I don't know at all. You don't know? How dare you. Why do you try to harm a helpless woman? That is nothing short of disgraceful. If you don't like it, please do to this Yukinojo whatever you like, sir. My business starts early in the morning, so I have not much time to waste tonight. Receive this. You call yourself a sword wielding samurai, but just watch from the sidelines. What is this child's sword play? You invited me, thank you. Yukinojo wants to see your way with the sword. You unsheathed your sword. So this is no game but for real? I mean it. Do it, there. Kadokura-sama... You won't come? You must come. Kadokura-san. Don't do it. There is no need for you to be killed. Don't come out. Danger. No, I don't care. How are you, onnagata? You are so frightened. Is this secret more important than your life? I've never told anyone yet. If you like, I can tell Kadokura-san here. You just stand there. Say something. Yukinojo-san. To tell you the truth, I wanted to see my loved one, you, covered in blood. So I asked this sensei to collect those men, however, they are all weak, I'm quite disappointed. I can do it. Don't do it, sensei. You will be down again. But I can't let him go. I don't say to let him go. Yukinojo-san... Don't you want to move? Shall I shoot? Look at the honeycomb on the pine tree. I never miss a target because I was trained at acrobat house. See? Not bad, is it? This gun... Can shoot five successive bullets. Yuki-san. Say something. You can't? Even Yuki-san can do nothing against this. It's dawn already. [A theatre in Edo period opened early morning. They needed the natural light.] Should we open anyway? No, the people want to see tayu, we can't. Why do you make me talk alone? This Ohatsu-san is short tempered. If I am upset, I'll set a fire and burn the old temple. I can do it. Yuki. Say something. Why on earth? Why can't I give up such a failure of a man? Do as you like? I'll shoot you. Hey, stop. You were afraid. I won't give you a merciful instant death. Yuki-san, you can see rats and weasels there. They can... suck your blood, you can show the ghosts your dance and play and die in madness. By now, the Nakamura Theatre stage, which concerns you, is open. I'll go see what it's like. That's it. Well, sirs, Nakamura Yukinojo is... Yukinojo is... for a moment...accidentally, What will it be? They'll cancel today's performance. No kidding! Why don't they start? They say the Hanamura tayu was kidnapped. Oh? The beautiful tayu was kidnapped? What a pity. What happened? It's strange. We came here to see the beautiful Yukinojo. That's too bad. You waited. Sit down! Thanks to my parents, I can see my loved one. If I knew he was coming, I would have prepared my hair this morning. You! See sis, the tayu of Hanamuraya is as sexy and beautiful as always. Even Kappa-no-Ohatsu can't understand what it means. Hanamuraya! Yukinojo's trapped Hiromiya. He put an idea into Hiromiya's head, to outfox his accomplice, Nagasakiya. During the inflation of rice prices in Edo, Hiromi-ya sold his rice below cost price to successfully ruin Nagasaki-ya who plotted the evil devices together with Hiromiya. Hiromiya artfully achieving his reputation in Edo, visited Yukinojo. He boasted to Yukinojo he was now the leading wholesale merchant in Edo. Did you forget already? Hey, all of you, sorry, leave us alone. Days ago, I heard that important government officers talked about me. About the matter of rice? Yes, that's it. I sold and sold. You don't know where you can find a chance in business. I bet on the chance. I moved my rice stock from Osaka to Edo and sold out immediately. Then the skyrocketing price of rice dropped sharply. Through that my reputation grew enormously in Edo. Like you. What a bold move. However, Edo people are happy with that, but you must face a big loss. No. I bought the rice at the cheapest price from farmers in the west, even if I sell cheaply in Edo, I still make some profit. Since Lady Namiji-san disappeared, Dobe-sama has lost his political power. I couldn't depend on him anymore, so challenged myself. These days Hiromiya enjoys a huge success. Meanwhile, Nagasakiya-sama was buying up rice to corner the market. He must face a huge loss. Nagasakiya? Nagasakiya was bankrupted. What? Such a big store bankrupted? If I'd known, I wouldn't have told you about it. But if you hadn't given me the advice my house and all the property would have been destroyed like Nakagakiya's. Don't worry, tayu, I'll always be with you. Make yourself at ease. Now, all your theatre members, let's go to Yoshiwara and have some fun! Hiromiya-san, Nagasakiya-san is looking for you, sir. Nagasakiya? Tell him, I'm not here. I'm not here, alright? Don't hide. Hiromiya! Oh, Nagasakiya-sama. Hiromiya... You betrayed me. No, I didn't betray you. This often happens in the way of the merchant. What did you say? Give me your fortune. What for? Because I am ruined on account of you. I helped you when you had big trouble in Nagasaki. Did you? How dare you! You licked the bones of the master of Matsuuraya and sucked his blood. You destroyed the family. Who did that? Someone reared by the Matsuuraya but who forgot the master's favour and betrayed him. Who was that? But there were other people involved. I won't mention them, for your sake. Dobe? Yokoyama? Hamakawa? Hiromiya? I have nothing to be scared of anymore. Stupid. Who would believe what you say? Why are you angry with me, a merchant should challenge in his way of business. What? His way of business? How could I do that now? The last challenge was rice. You destroyed my rice business too. Still you tell me to challenge in the way of business. If you've become a beggar, that's none of my business. Wait, Hiromiya. I'll teach you a bitter lesson. What will he do? See Yukinojo? Their fighting is a guidance from your father. Now, quick. Tomekichi, give me my kimono. He's changed. Fire! Stop the fire! I can't find my boy! My boy, my only son! Nagasaki-ya lit the fire. It is the death date of my mother. You, again! Kadokura-san. You. Yukinojo is... What? Yuki? Yuki-sama. Yuki-san, the lady and all the samurai are here. Do I make your secret open and clear? Or...? Kill! Heima kidnapped Namiji, Dobe's daughter. Heima loved her secretly. On the way, Yukinojo and Ohatsu became involved, as well as Yamitaro. Heima escaped from them and took Namiji in order to satisfy his own desire. Namiji, who loved Yukinojo, avoided Heima's violence using a knife and preserved her pure love for Yukinojo. Yamitaro tried to save Yukinojo and Namiji, but when he rushed to Namiji, she was already in a critical condition due to Heima. This knife was stuck into Mr. Kadokura's side. This seems to be my daughter's. This is hers. Recently many strange things have happened. Excuse me, sir. What? A man called Yami wants to see you, sir. Yami? He said he met you once and he has brought you something. Did he say Yami? Sir. - You can't handle the matter. - What? The master said you could meet. Go to the garden. The garden? Does he want to cut off my head? Leave it and go home. - But, you alone... - No problem. If he takes the contents he will be willing to entertain me. Hey, men, treat the box properly. Maybe you'll have to cut your belly. Yes. I thought it was you. You have something for me? Such a big parcel. Yes, sir. Rather bulky. Sir. Please leave us alone. You and I alone? It looks like something very confidential. You have many treasures in the world, but this is priceless. Does this need such a careful explanation? Where did you get this treasure? What is this, Yami? This is the corpse of a woman. Sir, please see whose body this is. This is... Namiji! Yami! Tell me! Where did you get this? Depending on your answer, you must pay for it. What? Sir... this is between you and me, isn't it? Leave. Now, Yamitaro, tell me the details. Sir, now I believe the fate of a meeting. The lady and I were complete strangers. I encountered the lady just before she died. I found she was your kin, so I treated her with respect by giving the last water to her lips from this my own hand. Tell me more details. Her last moments were peaceful. She looked like she was willing to die. I believe she went to heaven. She told me that she was stalked by Kadokura Heima, for whom you built a sword school. She was attacked by him. Then she stabbed him in order to protect her chastity. So, it was true, my daughter stabbed Heima. He hurt the lady badly. What a pity. This is because, sir, you didn't care for your daughter's feelings, but sought your own success alone. So my daughter was kept by Yukinojo. No, that's totally wrong. Yukinojo never accepted lady Namiji. Are you saying my daughter died without seeing Yukinojo whom she loved to death? There was the mercy of god and Buddha. With her last breath she had a dream that Yukinojo took her hand. A dream. She mumbled that she would be with him in the future. What was her message to me? What did she say? Her message to you? It wasn't easy for me to hear that. She tried to say something accusing you. But she was modest. No word to you, sir. Without saying a word, my daughter dead. Sir, please hold a funeral and pray for her soul. I take my leave now. Yamitaro, wait! Hey! Yokoyama, Hamakawa. If you fail, it will pile shame on top of shame. Understood, sir. I see this is the plan of your people. I know you will go to hell sooner or later. I can do it now. But taking your life is not my job. Someone needs your shabby head. Until then make sure you don't lose it. Such a sight for a samurai! Hold on. A more terrible one is waiting for you. There's no need to run. I know you. You are a samurai of Dobe-sama. Hamakawa-sama. Yokoyama-sama. Who are you? Nakamura Yukinojo. What? Yukinojo? That Yukinojo is trying to avenge you since the time of Nagasaki. Yukinojo? Ruined Nagasakiya, who had gone mad, and Hiromiya, crazy through the loss of his child, were trapped by Yukinojo again. They were led to a hellhole (trap cellar), where the two insane half-dead men will end their lives without the help of anyone else. Meanwhile, in a corner of the theatre, broken hearted Ohatsu became upset and tried to destroy Yukinojo's stage by gathering a gang. What had Yamitaro done to counter her plot? For Yukinojo, Yamitaro was his sole help. Where is my baby boy? The boy is in Children's Limbo, already. You, Saburobei, forgot Matsuuraya's long favour, betrayed him and ruined the family, in conspiracy with magistrate Dobe, Yokoyama, Hamakawa and Hiromiya here. It is the voice of the master. Forgive me, please! How can I forgive? My dear wife was sent to Dobe's residence by you where she was tormented to death by biting off her tongue. Can you imagine how terrible to bite off one's tongue? Can you, Saburobei? Compared to her pain, your current suffering is nothing. That was not done by me alone, sir. That Hiromiya did it... That bastard did it. What are you saying, Nagasakiya? I'm scared. Hiromiya-dono, are you afraid of me? By your sweet talk I was involved in illegal trade before I noticed. Then our property was confiscated and I died in madness. And now are you afraid of me? Forgive me, sir. Matsuuraya-dono, Sei'emon-dono, I was wrong. But it wasn't only me. This Saburobei set the plot. What? Me? Now you know. Hiromiya, Nagasakiya. The concentration of soul will do. The soul of Matsuuraya Seimon stays in his son Yukitaro and here watches your end by doing nothing. You don't know this face? The face of Yukinojo. Father... please watch. The place is different, but in the same hellhole, the trap cellar of the theatre, those two are falling into a burning hell. Muku... Muku, now! Sorry, sir. Stop. Sorry, sir. Stop. Sorry, sir. Give me your face. Why has nothing happened? Blood! Female thief Ohatsu, you are arrested. Tayu... Oyakata. You are free after this performance, aren't you? Today is Namaji-san's funeral. Can you go? Yes. I was planning to do so. If you miss this chance you won't find another. Yes. I will do so. Tayu. Yokoyama and Hamakawa. I have killed them both. Then, I will wait. The carriage is at the back entrance. [Dobe Sansai lost his office. He was ordered to a leisurely post.] Reporting, sir. What? Hamakawa-san and Yokoyama-san were killed by someone in the Nakamura theatre. Hamakawa and Yokoyama killed? In the Nakamura theatre? Damn, Yukinojo! A person called Yukinojo of Nakamura Theatre is visiting for Namiji-sama's funeral, sir. What? Yukinojo? What shall we do, sir? I'll meet him. Show him to my room. But he says he wants to burn incense for the dead. Do as I say. Wait. You see? Certainly, sir. Suspended ceiling! Yukinojo, Show your face. No need of an innocent look. Yes, you resemble. Very much so. Resemble whom? Your deceased mother. An exact copy. Until now I was unable to remember. Are you saying I am an exact copy of my tormented mother who killed herself by biting off her tongue? Don't say that. I didn't torment your mother to death. I was fond of your mother. I wanted her to be mine. You knew my mother was wife to my father. Yes. Don't say a thing. Maybe, through your curse, the members of the Nagasaki age were ended, but... I will not lose. You cannot defeat me. No sir, indeed. You are Dobe senior, who drove my mother and father to die in madness, licked the bones, and sucked the blood of Matsuuraya. How could you be defeated by Yukinojo, the child of Matsuuraya? I am your enemy. I, Dobe Sansai, since Suragano-kami had everything in the world without fear or worry, that is who I am. Look! Your body will be crushed to pieces. No! Yukinojo here, wants to thank you. My first performance in Edo has ended to your satisfaction. Thanks to you I have fulfilled my long term wish. I cannot staunch my tears of gratitude. When I perform in Edo again I will humbly ask to receive your favour once more. END Subtitles: Maya Grohn corvusalbus edit
