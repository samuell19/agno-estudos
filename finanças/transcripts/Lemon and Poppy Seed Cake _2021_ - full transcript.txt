Marina, pregnant woman at term. She was found half death on the street. Haemorrhage due to placental abruption. - How many blood bags do we have? - Only two. She is type O-positive. - Anybody with this blood type? - No, and no relatives showed up. - More blood. - We don't have any. No relatives. Colloids. Come on. Come on. Doctor. Marina. Marina. Marina. Time of death. 1:38 pm. - Nobody is going to take care of her? - I don't think so. The police said her mum was a prostitute and lived on the street. I'm going to call the orphanage. Marina, come over. Just talked to Mathias. He sends you his love. He can't wait to see you. - Hello, Ana. - How are you? Good. So busy. I have two amazing pieces of news. First, Armando found a buyer who's willing to pay 1,2 million euro. - What do you think? - What about the second? Guess whose name is registered as co-owner for 20%? - Our grandma Nerea. - Our grandma? Yes, I've gone through all her docs again and there's nothing that relates her to us. - This is so weird. - Yes, it is weird. Your room is ready. I told you I'd rather stay in a hotel. Marina, it's been 14 years since we last saw each other. Ana, I need to go. Ok, but I'll pick you up at the airport. As you wish. - I can't wait to see you. - I need to go. Send my love to your daughter. Bye. - Good morning. - Hi. Look who I found. Good morning. How are you? - Good morning. - Hello. - Hello, doctor. - Hello, sisters. She's the new blessing. Nobody has claimed her. Her mum was at death's door. We did a C-section, but she didn't make it. Well, let's see if we can get an authorisation as soon as possible for an adoptive family. You park the car further every day. If you don't want to pick me up, get me a motorbike and leave it. Don't start again, darling. Moron. Bitch. - Is there something wrong? - Nothing. - I just want to leave this fucking rock. - Anita, language, please. When I turn 18, I"m leaving this shitty island for good. Really? Where will you go? You don't have money nor a career. You're very demanding, but what about your marks at school? C in Religion, Spanish and Literature. B in English. D in Maths, Physics and Chemistry. My Goodness. Your father is going to be thrilled. - I don't care. - Anita, show a bit of respect. What are you going to do with your life? You're not a little girl anymore. Nothing. I'll do nothing. I wasn't born to study. That's all. Oh, that is so silly. I did it. You can also did it. In your case, grandma was donating money to the school. - Who said that? - Nobody. I just made it up. - Who said that? - Dad. To clown around with his mates. I'll learn how to live without money. I don't want to end up like you. All the luxury... And now what? Do you want me to sell your Louis Vuitton bags to pay for my school? From the Principal. - I told you not to open the letters. - The bank rejected the payment. - Hello, doctor. - Hello, sister. So nice to see you around here. How can I help? Just wanted to bring a few things to the baby and check how she was doing. She's fine. I was just about to feed her. Come along. Come on. That cot over there. She's the one crying. Is that how you named her? - Yes. Adina. - What does that mean? It means she has been saved. Do you want to feed her? Sit down. Sorry, I'll be assisting the visitors. Here are the rooms for the new born. As you can see, we bath them... - How was it? - Bad. If 1 visit Switzerland that often, Customs will be suspicious. Next time, you go. The bank is already aware. - Me, alone? - Yes, you, alone. It's not that difficult. Anyways, that was the last one. The piggy bank is empty. Bernat, I just landed. Do you have the documents ready? No, let's not talk over the phone. I"m on my way. I'll let you know the details. Drop me at Bernat's house. This is for home expenses and the school. Put the rest in the safe. - Don't touch it. Is that clear? - All clear. I overheard you told Bernat we'll keep a 7% commission for the sale of the bakery. I think that's too much. I don't care what you think. Ana, we're broke. If I don't solve the situation, we're both going to jail. Never. Bring me three eggs, toasts and very strong coffee. You. Will you marry me? And...? Then, what? What will you do? What you just did. Smiling and... I don't care. - Are you leaving already? - My flight leaves in a couple of hours. She is so cute in these clothes. Anything you need, call my colleagues or Mathias. I will. No worries at all. Do you think she'll still be here when 'm back? I'm sure she will. Before putting her for adoption, we wait if any relatives claim her. - Can I have a picture with her? - Sure thing. Here. - Get it. - Can I have another one? I love you. I love you too. Marina. Marina. Welcome. You haven't changed at all. Well, you look prettier. Finally we meet each other. - She's got granny Nerea's eyes. - Yes, and that's it. It's a pity she is not like her. Are you tired? Do you want to go to the hotel? No, I'd rather go straight to the bakery. - Have you found out anything else? - No, nothing. I'd like to see the documents and the contract of sale. Everything is fine. Armando and his lawyer reviewed it. But, if you ask... I have a copy in the boot. Good morning, Catalina. She is my sister Marina. Nice to meet you. Likewise. Isn't it charming? Even though she was an old woman, the house looks okay. The kitchen is simple but convenient. I'm not much of a decorator. There's nothing to see here. Will check over there. Why did you empty the house without telling me? Armando said it would be easier to sell. - You didn't find anything to...? - Nothing. - Nothing? - Nothing, Marina. Trust me, please. This room was already empty. Just like this. I looks like it was never furnished. I"ve missed you a lot. - Let's continue. - Yes, of course. Let's continue. I love how bakeries smell. Making bread with granny was lots of fun. Do you remember? I bet she would have been happy just being a confectioner or a chef. Or a baker. That's the curse of women who never were who they really wanted to be. Mum, you said it was granny Nerea who invented the lemon cake recipe, right? - Yes. - Well, here you have it. That's grandma's handwriting. That's her recipe book. It looks like the examples were also written by her. Lola Vargas, August 6th 1971. And that's December. Same year. Look. Catalina, you know we want to sell. We should agree on an amount for you to leave. I already told your husband I want my salary for the current month. - You're entitled to a compensation. - I know what I am entitled to. - What day do I need to leave? - I don't know. - We sign the contract in 2 days. - I need a week to tell everybody in town. - We're okay with that. - All good, then. I'm leaving. Catalina, do you know why our grandma had a 20% share of the bakery? There was an accident with the oven. The bakery burned down. Tomeu died in the fire. Lola's husband. She lost everything. Your grandma lend her money so she could reopen the bakery. Lola gave share to her in return. How was the relationship between Lola and our grandma? - She was a maid at your house. - Our house? - We never heard about her. - She wasn't there for long. - These are our grandma's recipes. - She taught her how to read and write. She was really fond of her, then. They were. Both of them. Now I need to go. Lock with your keys. - Should we go? Want to see anything else? - No, let's go. I'll lock, then. How are you? Did you have a nice sleep? This is a beautiful day for a hike. We miss you loads. We love you. Me too. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Did you sleep okay? - Yes, very. Thanks. I'm Ursula. I run the hotel. - Nice to meet you, ma'am. - You're only staying for a week? I hope so. - Are you going to buy Lola's bakery? - No, I inherited it. Are you related to Lola? I"m sorry. She was a great woman. I didn't know her at all. Did you know her, ma'am? This is a really small town. Don't call me "ma'am". I"m not that old. The moment I met Lola I knew we'd get on really well. Then, my husband died. And we were both widows and foreigners. - How was she? - She was nice with everybody. She was so funny when the Andalusian temper came out. There was something. She was gloomier every day. When I asked, she smiled back. She smiled and changed the subject. Have you talked to Catalina? They were dear friends. They worked together all day. Yes, we did. It looks like questions annoy her. Talk to Joana. She is related to her husband. And talk to Vicenç as well. The local news room. My mum told me Lola was really pretty. Tomeu, my mum's cousin, fell in love the moment he saw her. At my house, it was all tattle. They said she was sleeping around, she was a gold digger. - Well, that was life back then. - Gossip. She came to my shop every Saturday to get flowers to decorate her bakery. In winter, she'd come to get poppy seeds for her lemon cake. Do you remember when...? In spring, she'd get her basket and pick poppies outside the town. Lola loved that. - Did she had any relatives in the island? - Not that I know of. Her mum and her aunt came when she and Tomeu got married. That's what my mum told me. As far as I know, nobody else came to visit her. That's final. 30 years taking photos at weddings, christenings and communions give you some knowledge about your fellow neighbours. - Did you know her well? - Yes, sure. From the day she arrived in town to work at some pharmacists' house. She was 17 years old. She was so beautiful. An Andalusian beauty. I asked her hundreds of times to photograph her. But she always refused. She would say that whoever portrays you, could steal your heart. - Does the pharmacist live in town? - Yes. But he's lying in the cemetery. With his wife. There you go. Lola and Catalina seven years ago. The only time she let me photograph her. The pharmacist wife never wanted her around. She only agreed cause an old friend asked them a favour. One day she confessed to my mum she didn't trust her. Lola was very discreet. She was always working. She made the best bread in Mallorca. I"m not exaggerating. The tastiest lemon cake I've ever tried. She would give a piece to all her usual customers. - You can keep it. - Thank you. - She has a gloomy look. - Yes, I told you. Any questions? Let's start, then. We'll sign the deeds in 2 days at the notary's office. Mr Helmut agrees to only formalize a million legally. From the rest, we'd deduct expenses and Armando's commission. And what's left would be split in cash. Marina, do you agree? Sorry, 'm not sure about this. What? - Ana, I don't want to sell. - I beg your pardon? Marina, you said you agreed. This man came all the way from Germany to sign the contract. - I need more info before I fully commit. - Bitch. - You want to fuck me over. - Armando... - Don't touch me or you'll regret it. - Go away. Leave my house now. I said go. Fuck! I'll leave, but you're not kicking me out. Don't forget 50% of this house is mine. 'M sorry. 'm sorry. I'll think about it and et you know soon. - You, resentful bitch. - Armando, please. You've fucked people over all your life. Let me go. For fuck's sake! Your mum couldn't stand you. Go and fix this. Marina. Marina, please. - Why the rush? - That was what we agreed on. First, we sign the contract and then we investigate who she was. First selling and then asking. - Sorry, Ana, but I'm not selling yet. - Why? - To harm Armando? - I couldn't care less about him. My life is full of question marks and I don't want another one. - What are you talking about? - Your dear husband just reminded me. Why did our parents send me to study abroad when I was 14? - Why didn't they want me back? - Of course they did. I asked them. I begged them to be back. Dad would always convince me to keep studying abroad. - Apparently, one size didn't fit all. - You were a smart student, I wasn't. You studied in the best universities. Where's the issue? - I never asked for it. - Marina... We're broke. I had to let the gardener go. And Carmen. They didn't take this house away because it belongs to both of us. We need the money. You've lived in this house for 15 years. Never asked for anything. It'll be just a few days. I'm not asking much. The German wants to raise to 1,4 million. We split it and I pay for expenses and commission. - I'd like to talk to my sister alone. - I don't think so. Whatever you need to say, you say it in front of me. Otherwise, Ana doesn't have anything else to say. You can have the house. I'll have the bakery. But... This house is worth way more. I know. The bakery is enough for me. Now it's yours. And that... turns you on. Mathias... - Hurry up. We're going to be late. - Coming. I promise. - Is the Wi-Fi working better? - Yes, it is better. Thanks. Argentinian pie. My specialty. Try this eco wine. Thank you very much. - Will you have the set menu? - Yes, menu is fine. What a lovely picture. Who is that baby? An African girl. I assisted her birth. Her mum was really sick and died in the operating room. So, now she's in an orphanage waiting to be adopted. I'll get a copy ready for both of you. Ana. Thanks, Jaume. - 'M sorry about yesterday. At was my fault. I was doubtful. If you sell the house, you and your daughter will have nothing. This is just a bad streak. It'll be fine in a few months. What are you going to do? When are you leaving? 'M staying a few more days. See what I can find out. I'll stay in the flat at the bakery. But... it's empty. You don't even have a bed. I know. Do you want to help me out? You can still run the bakery, if you want. - For how long? - I don't know for sure. Well... I'm not a toy. Now 'm selling, now I'm not. I"m sorry, but I'll wait. I need to find an assistant. I can't do it on my own. - Sure. You choose. - Okay. I'll find somebody. I'm moving in here. The house is fine. It only needs a bit of paint. Nice. - Catalina, was Lola sleeping around? - Who said that? - Somebody said... - That's a lie. That's a total lie. - How do you know? - Because I know. Damn it! Whoever said that I hope their teeth fall out. - Come on, Catalina. Hurry. - Yes. Could I have half a dozen biscuits? - Good morning, Catalina. - Morning. - Good morning, Catalina. - Morning - Good morning, Joana. - Good morning. Marina, which one do you prefer? I don't know, Ana. Okay, this one. Ana. We're getting there. Come on. Here. Come. Lay down. - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. 'M fine. This sofa would look amazing in your living room. - How long have you been bleeding? - Only the last few months. Does it hurt during intercourse? I don't know. It's been a while since our last intercourse. Well... 'm seeing a gynaecologist on Monday from the National Health Service. - What happened to your gynaecologist? - I can't afford her anymore. If you decide to rent the house, that's the best option. Sofa bed. So convenient. How come didn't you tell me? I could have checked you up. It's a minor thing. I already have had many medical tests. And I hope that's it. I'm done with people checking down there. Do you want me to come with you? Well, yes. I could do with a second opinion. Did you enjoy the meal, girls? Very, Ursula. The sea bass was delicious. - I know, right? - Very good. - Would you like a digestive? - No, thanks. I'm trying to convince your sister not to sell the house. - It will double its value in 2 years. - I told her the same. You could also sell eco products at the shop. - That's so cool. - I told Lola. 'M a gynaecologist. Not a confectioner or a shopkeeper. And I was a Literature teacher, and now I run a hotel. Life is full of surprises. At the back, please. There. It doesn't work. If you want Wi-Fi in all the house, you need a booster. Sometimes, she's smarter than all of us. - Choose one of them. - None. Let's open that one. That wine is so refined. Just like you are. Okay, then. Now that you buried the hatchet, are you going to tell me what happened? You didn't speak to each other for 14 years. Darling, let's talk about it later at home. I'd rather talk about it now since you're both here. Marina, you're my only aunt. I have a right to know the truth. Okay... When you were born, your dad spent a lot of time in Panama, dealing with our businesses there. I asked Marina to come so I wasn't alone during my last month of pregnancy. - She quit her job in... where was it? - In Darfur, Sudan. - Cruel war, right? - Whatever. I'll check it online. - So? - So she came to Mallorca. She took care of me during that month. She dealt with me, a new mum. She was the only one there when you were born. Dad was in Panama, running his fucking businesses. - Anita. - Okay. - You dad arrived three days later. - Five days. Five days later. Your aunt had to go, but I asked her to stay one more week. I shouldn't have asked her. You were crying all the time. We'd take turns to sleep. We were exhausted. Your dad was very busy with the estate agency. We took your cot to your aunt's room, so he could sleep. The three of us slept there for the entire month. It was a beautiful month, despite barely sleeping 3 hours. One night, you wouldn't stop crying. Your dad woke up and came to the room shouting and asking us to shut you up. Your aunt already had a couple of fights with him and she exploded. She told him he was selfish and sexist. He got angry and told her he was done and she wasn't welcome anymore. So he kicked her out. And I allowed it. I remained in silence and let you father kick her out. I have asked you to forgive me before. And I'm asking again now. 14 years is too long. I shouldn't have let so much time pass. I think Lola deserves a toast. To Lola. Whoever you are, thank you for taking my little sister back. - Do you want to toast with us? - Can I? You can. Today is a very special day. I can't believe it. Dad's boat. Armando wants to sell it, but I opposed. It belongs to both of us and you don't want to sell it. Come here. Sit down. Come closer. You were crying for it. Since I arrived. My daughter doesn't let me anymore. She never liked me brushing her hair. Good morning, Catalina. It's too early to be awake. I couldn't sleep. I spread the word in town to find an assistant for the bakery. I can help you out in the meantime. - Have you ever made bread? - Our grandma showed us. And what I don't know, I can learn it from you. Can I use it? If you don't want to, I can leave. You can do whatever you want. The bakery is yours. People in town have told me Lola made a delicious lemon cake. And she gave a free piece to her customers. - Why don't you do it? - That was Lola, not me. Well, if she liked that. 'M not doing it. And if you don't agree, don't expect me come tomorrow. I won't force you to do it. Grandma Nerea's kitchen always smelled like that. Freshly baked bread. Did my grandma visit the bakery? - Not that I know of. - Why? She was a co-owner. You should've asked that to your grandmother. Lola signed the will 17 years ago. She didn't get in touch with us to let us know. How come? I don't know. That was Lola's business. Our grandma never mentioned the bakery. You know why? I don't know that either. What about us? What do we have to do with all of this? Your grandmother helped Lola, and she added you to the will in return. - That's all you need to know. - Why did nobody tell us about her? Again. I cannot answer these questions. Who do I need to ask then? - Who? For Christ's sake! - Nobody. Damn it! Maybe you don't need to ask anybody. Lola gave you the bakery because she wanted to. Show some respect to the last will of the deceased. Don't force it with Catalina. Move on. Maybe next time you're back, she's willing to open up to you. I don't think the inheritance is the only thing you're worried about. I can't stop thinking about Adina. I visited her at the hospital to check on her. She wouldn't stop crying. I hold her and then she fell asleep. When they took her away I felt I was abandoning her. Don't put the blame on yourself. She's a baby. 'M sure she will he adopted soon. Aren't you happy? Not at all. - Why? - I don't want anybody to adopt her. When I was holding her, I felt something really special. I was at peace. I think about her as if I had given birth to her. - I don't want anybody to take her away. - What are doing here, then? Go there. Take her away. Steal her away. Abduct her. I don't know. Didn't you think about adopting her? Every single day since they took her to the orphanage. - Why don't you do it? - I don't know. I don't know. My sister. I forgot we were meeting for dinner. Go with her. We resume our chat later. Hi, Anna. I"m at your doorstep. Sorry. I forgot we had a date. I'm with Ursula. Okay. Let's reschedule for tomorrow. No, why don't you come over for dinner with Ursula and me? I need to decide on something. I'd love to share it with you. Thanks you. - I still don't know what to do. - Well, I think you do. What's going on? I"m thinking about adopting an African girl. - A black little girl? - Anna, please. Sorry. What do you think? What are your thoughts? I thinks it's wonderful, but you never wanted to be a mother. Until now. We have the right to change our mind. I'd need to quit my job to be able to take care of her. I don't think Mathias is willing to adopt. He wanted to be a father. I was the one who said no. - Have you talked to him? - No. Then, do it. Call him. It's a very delicate subject to talk over the phone. Marina, I know why you are scared to become a mother. You need to put this behind you. If you really love that girl, adopt her. Don't lose that experience. I'm sure you'll be a wonderful mother. And I'll be here for you. Whatever you need. - Good morning, Catalina. - You overslept. I had too much wine and I'm not used to it. What should I do? Set the oven. We'll start with the baguettes. Catalina, I'm leaving in 2 days. I"m going back to Africa. - Are you going to close the bakery? - No. I'll live here in Valldemossa. I"m going to adopt a girl. - Things have changed quite a lot, then. - You can say that again. - Have you ever worked at a bakery? - Never. Lola reopened the bakery, and since Tomeu died in the fire, she needed someone to help her. I showed up and told her I wanted to work. She didn't ask me if I knew how to do it. She looked at me in the eye and said: Come early in the morning. At 5 am. And here we are today. She's the best person I've ever met. - She was never mentioned... - Again? How many times are you going to ask me? The times I needed, Catalina. - I need to know. - You know what you needed to know. Three months ago I lost my best friend. The only friend I've ever had. Leave her alone. And leave me alone. For Christ's sake! 'M sorry. You have your reasons. I don't want to force it. When you're ready, you tell me what you need to tell me. 'M SO sorry. He sent me these yesterday. When there's an emergency, he is the one setting up the camp. He has beautiful eyes. And a transparent gaze. He's a toy boy. Anna Ferragut Rosell. - Good morning. - Good morning. Take a seat. - She's my sister. Can she stay? - Sure, not a problem. - She's also a gynaecologist. - Very good. All the results are in, apart from the biopsy, which will come in an hour. A biopsy? I forgot to tell you. We've scheduled a CT scan and an MRI for today. - We need to be sure. - About what? Is there something wrong? I want to give you an accurate diagnosis and rule out any further complications. Take them to Radiology. They are expecting her. Call Dr Fernandez. She's Head of the Gynaecological Oncology unit. Let's go. Tumour mass invading the right parametrium and extending to the right pelvic floor. - It affects the lymph node. - Rectum and bladder? They don't seem to be affected. We'd need to do a rectoscopy and a cystoscopy to be sure. I'm surprised she hasn't had a massive haemorrhage. We need to operate on it as soon as possible. Then, we'll know the extent of it and what organs are compromised. Why do I have this? According to the results of the biopsy, it was caused by a HPV infection, type 18. That is a sexually transmitted virus. And you just have it suddenly? These tumours take years to develop. When did you have your last check-up? I don't remember exactly. Maybe 5 or 6 years ago. You might have contracted the virus before. Unluckily, in your case, the tumour developed without any symptoms or signs of its speed. - When can we operate on her? - As soon as possible. I'd hospitalize her today. She could have an haemorrhage. We do a lymphogram to determine lymph node affection and we schedule surgery right away. - I need time. - Anna, we don't have time. I need it. I need to sort out my life before I go on surgery. - How long? - A week. - Anna, that's too much... - Three days. Plesae. I'm not going to die before that. I was happy this morning. I wanted to go shopping for baby clothes so you could take them with you. Finally, mademoiselle is here. I've been calling you for an hour. I ran out of battery. Don't fucking get in my face, Anna. We're supposed to meet at 5. We have a deal with an English couple. You need to sign the contract. I'm not signing anything. - I beg your pardon? - You heard me. Damn it! I'm leaving. Let's talk tomorrow. Stay, so you can hear what I have to say and I can spare a visit. - I want to file for divorce. - What? I should have made that decision time ago. Bitch. You're all the same. Are you also referring to the ones you spent our money on? 'M referring to all of them. Starting with you. Good hotels, fine clothes and cards make you a great husband. Now we're broke, you cut me loose. I won't add anything to that. Bernat is here. What I have to say is too embarrassing. I don't care what you have to say. File for divorce. Forget it. - You can't refuse. - Let's go, Bernat. - Before I do something I'll regret. - Armando. Armando, look at me. I have cancer. I'll have surgery in 3 days. I want to file for divorce whether you agree or not. Bernat, I need to sell this house, though. But on my terms. Can you help me out? If that's an issue, I'll get another lawyer. No, you can count on me. - I also want to make a will. - Aren't you rushing? Maybe. But I want to rest assure the only properties I have left are for my daughter only. My sister will be the administrator until she's 18. I'll write it down and we go the notary's office. - I'm so sorry, Anna. - Thanks, Bernat. I need your help more than ever to secure the future of my daughter. That's why I'm here. I'm her father. You have never taken care of your daughter. So, let's leave it. Sorry for keeping you waiting and all the drama. I'm going to my room. - I don't feel very well. - Anna. We don't need to divorce. I'm your husband. We'll go through this together. I got my condition it from you. I don't want Anita to find out. I don't want her to be embarrassed of her father. If you cause me more trouble, the entire island will find out who the real Armando Rius is. Warn the next one you're sleeping with. Yeah. - What's the matter, mum? - Can we talk? Now? I'm studying. Can't you wait? No, darling, today I can't wait. What are you studying? Maths. - I hated Maths. - You hated studying. Yes, that's right. And I hope... Mum, please. Don't be a pain in the ass. Anita, I went to the doctor with your aunt Marina. They told me... I have a tumour. And I need to have surgery as soon as possible. That's serious, right? We won't know until they operate on it. Fuck. When they operate on it, we'll know the extent. And I'll be able to tell you how long I'll stay here. I can't leave her alone, Paula. Thank you. Yes, please. Tell him to call me as soon as possible. Don't worry. I'll call right away so they can send a replacement. Thanks, Paula. Send my love to all. There's no way to reach him out where he is right now. Come here. Sit down. I don't want to put more on your plate, but years have given me as many lessons as wrinkles on my face. You need to think what to do if Mathias doesn't want to adopt the baby. If I could talk to him, I'd convince him. 'M sure he'd understand. That doesn't answer my question. It's a life-time decision. Mathias needs to be convinced, but you need to be even more. - And I am. - Then, I'll ask you again. If Mathias says no, will you do it by yourself? Yes. I'll pour myself a glass. Do you want one? No, thanks. I need to have a clear mind. I think more clearly with a glass. Hello, Marina. Hi. How's everything? Very good. A lot of work, as usual. - And the baby? - Our little Adina is perfect. She's getting bigger every day. Sister, I was calling you to... I want to adopt Adina. I feel she's my own child. I'll do everything to give her a beautiful home so she can be a happy girl and a wonderful woman. Has she been assigned to a family? - Have any relatives claimed her? - Not at all. We can't assign her to a foreign family. I'm just... I"m just thrilled. The moment I saw you with her, I knew she already had a mother. - You only had to realise. - What do you need to do? What do I need to do? We still need to wait for the adoption authorisation, but you can start filing for adoption. From here, of course. - You can't do it from Spain. - Why? The Spanish law doesn't allow direct adoption. You can't choose the baby you want to adopt. Come as soon as possible. We"ll find a way here. I'd get the first flight, if it was for me. My sister has just been diagnosed with cancer. Oh, Jesus. Marina, 'm so sorry. So... Stay there with your sister. I'll do whatever I can from here. I'll send you an e-mail with the steps you need to follow. It is very important your residence permit is up to date so they can accept the adoption as a local adoption. - And your marriage certificate. - "m not married." - Aren't you married to Mathias? - No. - But you can marry him. - He doesn't know I want to adopt her. Here, law forbids single-parent adoptions in case the parent is homosexual. - What a load of bollocks! - Exactly. - Sorry, sister. Sorry. - No worries. Marina, you've been living in Africa for a long time. Life collapses and is rebuild every day. You need to be strong. We'll find a way. Thank you. Thank you very much. How are you feeling? Good. I'm in the clouds. Hello, my love. How are you? Shit! You need to go back. Convince him and bring the baby as soon as possible. I'll go there once we know how you're doing. The baby will be well taken care of. I sent money and a friend will visit her. And I'm not going to force Mathias. Yeah. There's a buyer for the house. You need to help me to find an apartment. - For what? - What do you think? I'll live with my daughter once I'm out of here. Alone? Out of the question. - Why not? - Because I say so. Okay. Okay. - Don't get mad. - "m not mad." Yes you are. Well, I am mad. Very mad. But not with you. Well, well. Somebody wants to change my decoration. Only the good stuff. So you feel like home. - What about my reading chair? - You mean the nap chair. My nap chair, yes. Anita, what a change. From a 600-square-meter house to a 100. I don't care, my Lady. Here... you have your garments and shoes. Only the ones that fitted it. There, your creams and potions for your wrinkles. - Well, I don't have wrinkles, do 1? - And... Your sleeping cap. - I don't use a sleeping cap. - Now you do. To keep your head warm. Good morning, Catalina. Why are you up, ma'am? I needed to keep myself busy. And you need help. And don't call me "ma'am", Catalina. Don't you worry. 'm not going to ask you again. Good morning. Can I help? - Good morning. - Shouldn't you be at school? It's Saturday. The week goes by so quickly. Come here. Pay attention. Same spot. Always. Girls, coffee and pies. Cata. You have a little helper. She's really smart, unlike others. Now you have an assistant, people keep asking me if you'll make the lemon cake. No. I said it enough. Well, put a sign on the entrance saying I can't be arsed to make the lemon cake. You're very funny today. It's a flaw I have since I was born. No worries. I'll do it myself. Did Lola ever tell you why she stopped working at their parent's house? - This again. - Did she have any problems? Their mother didn't like Lola. - Why? - I don't know. She came to town for work and stayed. Don't ask me again. Damn it! You're impossible, Cata. And you're an annoying old bat. God! That's awful. Might be the yeast. We need to try another one. Or might be the oven. I don't know how this works. - Don't look at me. - Okay, but don't refuse to help. - Good morning, Catalina. - Good morning. Give her a hand. What are you doing? A little bird told me you're in trouble. Where's the recipe? Here. Six. I'm going to crack them and whisk them. Delicious. Like our grandma's. Yes, indeed. But if 'm being honest, Lola's tasted different. Same recipe. Cata, why don't you try it and give us your thoughts? No, thanks. I don't feel like it. She's one hell of a woman. What do you want to do later? I don't know. What do you suggest, doctor? What's that? Weed. - Weed? - It'll ease the chemo's side effects. A treat from Ursula. - Are you sure? - Completely sure. These ones are already rolled. You'll need to roll the next ones. A good doctor needs to try the medicine before their patients. Let's start with a small dose. Here. Don't inhale too much. Give it a couple of puffs and wait 10 min. - I don't feel anything. - Just wait. You can't delay it anymore. - What? - Just go and bring my niece. Let's wait a couple of days. Next sessions are tougher. I have my daughter. She's a child. Well, Ursula offered her help. You're so stubborn. Go and get her. I'm not dying before I meet her. Don't joke about that, Anna. You won't die. You hear me? Never. I'm not going to die ever. We'll be eternal. Marina. - I love you so much, little sister. - Me too. What did you say? Me too. It doesn't go like that. It starts with an I. I love you. I love you. Say it like you mean it. It needs to come from your heart. If I die, you'll regret it forever. - Don't say that again, Anna. - Just say it. - I love you. - You're so cheesy. - Oh, come on! - Say it again. Say it again. - I love you. - Louder. - I love you! - Louder. I'm really scared. I"m so happy you are here. These are the keys of the house we rented for you. Some public workers will go and check you live there. The house is expensive, but ticks all the boxes. We go the consulate to ask for a certificate that confirms you've been living here for more than 2 years. Does that sound good? Yes. Now let's tackle the issue. I saw the public officer that needs to guarantee your adoption request. I insisted you're not a lesbian. He claims that if you're not married, the adoption won't be granted. A son of a friend would be willing to marry you. He's 27 and asks for 8,000 euros. I know him. He's a good boy. He needs the money to finish his studies in Spain. - How much time can this take? - Between 8 months to a year. Resolving your case before that would cost more. - How much more? - 10,000 euros. Shortcuts are always more expensive. I have enough for your fees and extra expenses. I'll give you the rest in a few days. It looks like I"m buying her, instead of adopting her. The moment I arrived in Africa, I learnt not to follow the law but to follow my heart. - Good morning. - Good morning. What will happen to the furniture? Your dad will keep some and we'll sell the rest. I love it. New life, new furniture. - Good morning, Anna. How are you? - Fine. We've made an inventory of everything. Is there anything else? Yes. Come with me, please. That mirror and that desk will go to the storage. - Mum, throw this dolls away. - And for the rest... Check if there's something you can sell. If not, just throw it away. Anita, check this out. All this was yours as a baby. Wow, I love this trunk. - Was it grandpa's? - Yes. Let's take it with us. Marina will love it. - Julio. - Yeah. Put that trunk over there with the stuff to Valldemossa. - You're a bit warm, mum. - I'll talk to your father and we leave. Hi. Hi. Go and pick your stuff. Go. - How is the chemo going? - Bad. It is what it is. Is there anything else we can do? Another treatment? Whatever the cost is. Money doesn't solve everything. A couple of years ago, we had too much. You were fine. And look at us now. - We're so unlucky. - Bad luck has nothing to do. But you'll be fine. You always keep your head above water. 'M sorry. Forgive me for everything. I'll ask you to agree on one thing. If something happens to me, I want Anita to stay with my sister. I can't accept that. - I'm her father. - When your paternity fever is over, what then? You'll see her as a burden. She won't be happy. And if you insist on keeping her close, she'll only hate you. Just listen what I say. I know both of you very well. If that's what she wants, she can stay with your sister. I"m done. I have everything I need. - Is that it? - I don't need anything else. I"m leaving. We've addressed the main things, you can decide the rest. If there's anything you need, call me, please. 'M meeting my husband to he. Three of this. That's what made grandma's cake special. Done. Well done, darling. - Your aunt is in Africa? - She'll arrive soon. - Send her my love. - Alright. - Bye, Catalina. - Bye. That's final. It's really tasty, but Lola's tasted different. Vicenç, we'll get there next time. Of course. - Bye. - Bye, Vicenç. What are you doing? Anna? The posh girls in my class won't know what's hit them. We hospitalise the ones that show cuts a week earlier. At least. We need to put them on a drip. Otherwise, labour will be hell. - It's my sister. - Get it, Marina. I'll check it out with them. Anna? Anita? - Surprise. - Surprise. Spring chemo cut. Isn't that cool? - What have you done? - A change of look. You're crazy. Both of you. Mum is crazier than me. She's stoned all day. The chemo sucks, but this... This is amazing. Long live weed. She's getting more stoned every day. How is the situation with my niece? Fine. All coming out. Little by little, but steady. - Do you know anything about Mathias? - I haven't seen him yet. Is he still in a spiritual retreat? No, he's setting up a camp for refugees on the border. That is a forgivable excuse. She just told me she wants to be an aid worker like you. I think that's great. There's always need for help. - Show me where you work. - You mean, the hospital? Yes. Next time you go, I'll join you. Is that okay? - If you get all B's, I'll let you. - Deal. Well. This is the gynaecologist consulting room. Or whatever is needed. We're doctors, nurses or psychologists. We need to be ready for anything. What's up, Marina? It's Mathias. Mathias. Your Mathias? Yes. Mathias. Mathias. - Anna, I need to go. - Yes, of course. - Call us later, okay? - Okay. Because you're not. Come on. What happened? I don't know. Mathias asked me to call you. Hello, Anna. No, please, no. No, please, no. Don't do this to me. Come on, ask him. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you too. Bravo! What are you doing? I can't stand staring at this closed trunk. - It looks like grandpa liked photography. - Yes. Photography and sailing were his two passions. Bring this here. Let's see that together. He kept saying if he had to be born again he'd be an adventurer. He'd shot documentaries around the world. Look. This is us with grandma Nerea. She was teaching us how to make bread. This is New Year's Eve. We made the bread for dinner. It turned out delicious. Look. This is us when we were almost your age. Wow, you're sisters, but you are so different. That's what everybody kept saying. This is dad. In his boat. 'M surprised we still have these pics. When he died, my mum threw all the pics away. Why? Because she felt like it. She wasn't much of a talker. What's wrong? Mum, check this photo out. I don't know. Have a better look at it. Thank you very much for everything. You don't need to thank me. My reward is that every child leaves in the arms of the best parents. This little girl is lucky you are her mother. Thank you. Bye. This sounds wonderful. Anna, I'm afraid I have bad news. Unluckily, the tumour didn't respond to the chemo as we expected. It's affecting a ureter. And there's also liver metastasis. That explains the yellowness of your skin. LI recommend you stay at the hospital SO we can give you palliative care to ease the pain and stop all the symptoms that might show. Would that do anything? Would it cure me? No. I don't think we can cure you. We're not telling anybody. As you wish. We're home with the little princess. - Can I give you a hand? - No, thank you. That was a rhetorical question, darling. Am I beautiful? I think you're beautiful, as always. Goddam stairs. Come here, my gorgeous. Hello. Welcome to your home, gorgeous. This delicious pie is a treat by our beloved bakery boss. You might as well have made Lola's lemon cake instead. Don't tease me, you Argentinian. What a surprise. Am I allowed, doctor? You can do as you please. And you too. Let's give a toast to the newest member of our tribe. To you, Adina. You're here to lighten the house up. Look. She ate and fell asleep. - She's a really good girl. - Anita. Tell me. I think it's time. Now? We're not going to wait anymore. She's going to be lovely in this. - She's gorgeous. - Marina. - Does this photo ring a bell? - Yes. Haven't see it for a while. This is you. And this must be... Lola? Catalina, this is Lola, right? When she was working at our house. Yes, she is. And that's also her, right? Yes, you can tell it's the same person. And who does she look like? You need to tell the truth to a dying woman. Lola made me swear I'd never tell anybody. I"m a woman of my word. Look at these photos. Marina and I were the same age as Lola in that picture. Don't betray your friend, but don't lie to us. Look her in the eye and tell her she doesn't look like Lola at all. Like two drops of water taken from the same well. Anita, get Adina, please. Come. Take a seat, Catalina. Lola might have been 14 when she started working at your parent's house. Your grandmother became very fond of her and treated her like a daughter. She taught her how to cook, read and write. When you were born, she took care of you. You were very dear to her. I don't know how it happened. Lola never said a word. And I never asked. Lola was very beautiful. Your dad loved taking pictures of her. "He portrays me like I'm a movie star", she would say. She got obsessed with him. A handsome elegant man. She fell in love with him. He fell in love with her. Go on, please. When she got pregnant, she was 17. Your grandmother put her in a nun centre with other pregnant young women. She didn't want to be apart from you. Your grandmother convinced her, it was a father's responsibility to raise a daughter. Your mother was left with no choice but to accept. Your parents move to Madrid for a while. They put the word out they were expecting another child. Nobody doubted that the Ferraguts were an honourable couple. To keep Lola away from Palma, your father found her a job at a dear friend's house. Jaume, Valldemossa's pharmacist. And you know the rest. Did she ever see me again? Yes. Every August, 18th, on your birthday, she'd make lemon cake with poppy seeds. She'd put the candles on. And would blow them out by herself. She'd give a piece to her neighbours. In the morning, she'd dress up. She would put mascara on. She'd go down to Sóller's harbour. That's where your dad took you sailing on your birthday. She... She'd sit at the bus stop, on the road into town, so she could see you going past with your father. And so she could see her daughter a year older. She would stay there all afternoon. And she waited until you came back, to see you for 5 more minutes. Then, she would go back to Valldemossa with a broken heart. Lola suffered all her life for you. But thought they'd give you everything she'd have never given you. Everything, except from what's most important. - Love. - She thought she was doing the right thing. That you would be happy. Every child's happiness is having a mother who loves you and protects you. And my mother, the woman I thought was my mother, was very cruel to me. - Marina... - She made everybody think I was the reason for all the issues between her and my father. When I was sent to study abroad, I thought it was my fault. I was expelled from my family. Can you imagine what this is like for a 14-year-old child? Lola thought you were happy. - That's what we all pretended. - Marina. - Lies and pretending. - Marina, please. How was she supposed to love me when she had to raise her husband's illegitimate daughter? - Nobody was happy. Who can be happy? - Marina. Catalina is not your mother. She is not Lola. Lola suffered a lot and cried a lot thinking about you. And about your father. She was always in love of him. And never ever, not a single day, stopped thinking about you. I spend all my childhood begging for love and my teenage years thinking dad didn't love me so he sent me away to study. He was trying to stop your relationship with mum collapsing. He sacrificed me. I wasn't the one to blame. You have so many reasons to be hurt. But now you have a daughter. And you need to be her mother. She will need you to be strong and have a clear mind. It's up to you to decide what to do with this piece of news. - I just gave you the older sister lecture. - Totally. Come closer. And you need to be strong, because I'll need your help. Good morning, Catalina. Good morning. You shouldn't have come down. It's fine. Anita will keep an eye on her. Brown bread? Yes. We need extra bread. It's a bank holiday, visitors will come into town. Where did Lola stand? Here. The owner cuts and weighs the dough. - Do you want to do it? - No. 'M the owner, but not a confectioner. I don't know what I am or who I am. Vicenç gave them to me for you. The day you went to see him, he knew who you were. Other people realised that too. I told them not to say a word. Did they ever see each other again? You father came to tell her you were leaving the island. They continued seeing each other. Were they lovers? I don't know. Your dad would come every Thursday and they'd spent all afternoon at Lola's. She hoped you'd all live together. That you'd know the truth. When you father drowned, she felt she had lost you again. But she was stubborn. She never lost her hope. She finally succeeded. You're at hers now. - How did Lola die? - Heart attack. She had heart issues for a long time. Where is she buried? My mother. Your mother never wanted to be buried. She wanted to be cremated and her ashes spread in the campsite. There's a field outside town where poppies bloom in May. She went there to pick up her seeds. - Were you making lemon cake? - I was going to do it for you. But I couldn't finish it. It's delicious. That's the authentic lemon cake. - Just like Lola's. - Really? It's really good. Right? Now we're talking, Catalina. I think time has come. I'm going to miss you so much. Two daughters and a bakery. You won't have time for that. 'M sorry. I shouldn't have been so stubborn. Forget about it. We said we'd fight and we wouldn't surrender. We're not surrendering, darling. I've decided to go on this journey. Marina, we need to do something. There's nothing we can do, sweetie. She'll suffer more every day. You mum wants to leave like this. Beautiful and looking into our eyes. We need to respect her wishes and let her go. Everything is ready. Okay, darling. Go and get changed. Thank you for everything. To both of you. Thank you for letting us be by your side. It has been wonderful to meet you. Have a good journey. Bye, my little African princess. I hope you have a beautiful life. I'm only going to ask you one thing. I want you to promise you'll do it. Of course, mum. Whatever you say. Don't make the same mistakes I made. Don't depend on anybody. We only have one life. Don't waste it. Do you promise? I promise. Do you want some morphine? No, not yet. I want to be lucid a bit longer. I know. DEDICATED TO THE WOMEN FROM MY TRIBE You're going to sea. LEMON CAKE WITH POPPY SEEDS To another place. A handful of seeds. Another year waiting for the boat. To capture your gaze. And another year. Who will you love? Disappear in my embrace I fly over a poppy field, my tears melt from me, I feel it when you cry. I love you and I don't have you. I love you, I come and go. I love you and I carry you inside me. There it lies, in this, your sea. Life lies within your gaze. Memories wither and, in this space of temporary absence, I don't cry for you and I love you.
