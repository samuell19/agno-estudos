When the door closes upon you, I shall doubt that all this really happened. You're here beside me. If I bend my head I can feel your cheek against my lips. I can hear your voice saying incredible things. Will it always be like this? Shall we never lose the wonder of it? For me it will never change. I have a stubborn streak in me. I may pray to forget, but it will never be granted me. How grave you are. Have you ever thought that people to whom miracles happen must be dazed? The blind man to whom his sight was suddenly given... ...must be startled by the strange new world. So it is with me. I came here hoping to catch a glimpse of you at court. You might have flung me a word, gracious and indifferent, as you passed. Instead... Listen. The village is waking. I must let you go. Goodbye. Good night... ...or if you wish, good morning. I shall never say goodbye. Antoinette. - Antoinette, where have you been? - Th?rese. The most wonderful thing has happened. Come with me and I'll tell you... - Haven't you heard? - Heard what? The king. He's dying. - Dying? - Yes. Smallpox. He's lost consciousness. See? Think what it means. You'll be queen. The queen of France. Queen of France. They say he's dying. That candle. When it's put out I shall be king of France. All these papers... So much to think of even before he's dead. I suppose I shouldn't have spoken to him as I did. He must have been ill then. Do you suppose what I said made him worse? But of course not. Oh, I forgot... ...I haven't told you. Would you like to hear what I said? Not now, do you mind? Very well. I told him I'd be king someday. Now it's going to happen. I don't want to be king. People expect so much of a king. Nothing comes easily to me. At least they can't send you back to Austria. I'm sorry, Louis. I'm afraid I wasn't listening. I say, they can't send you back to Austria. Well, it's kind of you to think of that. It can hardly matter to you, can it? I suppose you've always thought of me as a... Well, a symbol, the dauphine of France, never as a person, a woman. I didn't think of you at all, at first. I didn't like the marriage... ...but I grew to like you. To like me, yes. There's something I should tell you. I couldn't speak until I was sure. We can be one, indeed, now. Not only as king and queen, but as husband and wife. That's what I was trying to tell the king. I'm not much good at talking, but I care very much. I really don't know how I should get on without you. Louis... ...something has happened. I must tell you. The drums have stopped. You are king of France. Sire, may I be the first to say it. The king is dead, long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Long live the king. Your Majesty. How solemn you are. Do I shock you? I should be awed or sad, I know, but I'm not. I'm happy. Happy. You see, I've thought it all out very carefully. If I must be queen, I shall be able to do anything I want. I shall never let you go. Never. - But, my dear... - Do you know little Trianon? It's a quite small little palace, very secluded and very beautiful. It's to be my very own. And every day I shall come there and wait for you. But you must promise never to let anything keep you from me. Never to be late. Because every single moment will be precious... ...and there will be so few even as it is. Dearest, oh, you are grave. Oh, I love you so. But you are queen of France. - What could I possible bring you but...? - Happiness. Even a queen wants that, more than anything in the world. Oh, my dear, my dear, because of you I am strong... ...and certain and radiant. And beautiful. So beautiful it shames praise. Then you can never leave me, of course. With you, I'll be everything I meant to be. Serious and helpful, and a good queen. Oh, my darling. My mad, reckless, adored little darling. You know I'd give my life to serve you. But you must live openly, without fear, without reproach, in sight of all. I once thought if I were queen I'd be so happy. To be applauded and adored and obeyed. I don't want it now. I just want to be free to be with you... ...to love you. I cannot wear my crown upon my heart. Oh, my dear. You'll find your happiness in the love of your people. And nothing, nothing must stand between you and their love. Neither your heart, nor mine. And if I stayed... Oh, Marie. Marie, I couldn't share your destiny except to your own hurt. And that, I cannot do. My darling... ...what are you trying to say? Where would you go? To America. When? Tonight. No, no. Not tonight. Not tonight. But... ...I hardly know you. You see, I thought I would discover you day by day. Your childhood, your youth, all the little things... ...that would be so important to me. - I couldn't live. - Oh, my love, my darling. It can't end like this. Surely I might see you sometimes, not often. - I'd ask so little, so very little. - Marie, Marie. When I'm gone you'll be glad... ...that I didn't stand in the path of your destiny... ...making you less than you were meant to be. And that other kingdom, the love and the youth and the happiness... ...we might have had, what of that? We shall dream of it more tenderly because we didn't destroy it. Shall I never see you again? If you need me, I shall come to you. I shall always need you. And if I should ask you, "Was it well done?" You'll tell me, "It was well done." Take me in your arms again. Let me have that memory. When I lose heart to go on... ...I shall close my eyes... ...feel your arms about me. I shall know that I'm in your thoughts, that you're loving me. Always. Always, my dear. Giving me strength to live. Goodbye, my love. One hundred and one guns will announce the birth of a son and heir... ...21 guns, the birth of a daughter. Why, this is barbarous. Must the queen's child be born in public? Dr. Franklin, a French monarch belongs to the public. He must be born, he must live, and he must die in public. I was right here, in this very chair... ...when her first child, the little Princess Th?rese, was born. - Let's hope this one will be a boy. - Oh, yes. We present to you Louis Charles, dauphin of France and of Bourbon... ...duke of Normandy... ...most Christian prince of Navarre, count of Burgundy... ...lord of the Dauphin?, of Montmorency... And to what is your child heir? To oppression and slavery. He will toil as you have toiled, in famine and fear. He will plow the field in the sweat of his brow... ... and bring its food to those who neither toil nor reap. You furrow the soil in the heat of the day but it isn't yours. It's never been yours. Why, you work like rats in the bowels of the earth. For whom? A king, this one a drone. And a queen, oh, a dazzling queen who came from afar... ... hating the people of France. Throwing its gold away, the minted drops of your blood. Will you not listen? Will you not rise? Will you not demand the abolition of the aristocracy and its privileges? Is there no fire in your hearts? No fight in your fists? Liberty. Equality. Fraternity. People of France, demand it. The foreigner! The foreigner! They're throwing stones. Why are they angry with you? They're unhappy, dear. But it's not your fault. Perhaps not, darling. But there are things they don't understand... ...and things they don't forget. - My dear, did you have a nice ride? - Louis. I've been looking through some old papers. Louis, people threw stones at the carriage. - They threw stones? - Yes. And shouted insults. I'm trembling still. Those pale faces, full of hatred... ...shouting what's being shouted all over France. "Foreigner, Austrian, leech." Words put into their mouths by our noble cousin, Orl?ans. That scamp, he wants to be king. Everything serves him. The deficit, the hard winter, the failure of the crops. Why are things so difficult for us? I'm afraid we're just little people, Louis. Little people with a terribly big task. What an excellent smith you would have made. Think of it, with a cottage in the country and a little garden. And far happier. But you're clever. Thank you. Three o'clock, I must get down to the council. Here are your glasses. Now, where's that speech you wrote for me? Here it is. Now, you'll speak firmly, won't you? - Emphatically. - Yes, my dear, of course. Louis... There now, off you go. Oh, I meant to give you this. I very nearly forgot. It's an account of the Battle of Yorktown. It seems that Rochembeau's aide-de-camp, Count Fersen... ...you remember, acted as interpreter at the surrender of Cornwallis. This document is in his handwriting. I thought perhaps you might like to have it. Thank you. Louis. Yes, my dear? Have you...? Have you always known? Ah, Boehmer. But, Your Majesty... If Her Majesty would condescend... It's that wonderful necklace, Your Majesty. Oh, please, not now. How lovely. A masterpiece, Your Majesty. Yet I'm asking Your Majesty only what it cost me. One million, six hundred thousand francs. My dear Monsieur Boehmer. With people starving? You waste your time, monsieur, and mine. I don't understand. The Duke of Orl?ans led me to believe that she was interested. Oh, but such a price, and in times like these. Speak to her again. - We'll raise your commission. - No, it's hopeless. She wouldn't dare. The purchase might be made secretly... ...in the name of a friend. - My husband? - No, no, no. Pardon me. A responsible person. A person of wealth and standing. Suggest it. I repeat, Your Highness... ...Her Majesty will be responsible for the payments. But have you a document authorizing me to make the purchase in her name? Naturally. Here is Her Majesty's signature. Yes. Yes, I see. - Have you the necklace? - What? Oh, yes, yes. - You must be prudent. - Yes, yes. - Careful. The queen. - Where? - Your Majesty. - Rise, monsieur. The commission with which you honored me, madame. I thank you, monsieur. Your Majesty, dare I hope the past will be forgiven? - You may hope. - Your Majesty. Someone is coming. Good heavens. Go quickly, monsieur. This way. Did you get it? Here. Go easy, you. No need to break my wrist. Close your fool mouth. - Do you want to bring the guard on us? - Shut up, both of you. Shut up. Take your filthy hand off me, you swine. You couldn't have got it without me. You'll get your share. A million and a half francs in flawless stones. Go on. Start moving. Both of you. But I have creditors, obligations. If I don't get the money, it means ruin. The first payment was due June the 2nd. It's now August the 15th. First payment on what? On the necklace, sire. The diamond necklace. The diamond necklace? I have the contract, Your Majesty, signed by you. If you have any document... ...in which I agreed to buy your necklace, it is a forgery. But the necklace... - I handed over the necklace. - To whom? To whom, Boehmer? To the Prince de Rohan, Your Majesty. But this is insane, incredible. You say you received instructions? Written instructions from Your Majesty. - As I believed. - Have you the necklace? I was under the impression... ...that I placed it in Her Majesty's hands. Monsieur, for eight years I have not addressed a word to you. How could you believe I'd employ you as a go-between to buy a necklace... ...behind my husband's back? Your presumption is criminal. Will Your Majesty command this man to await your pleasure? It's all very confusing. Louis, I don't think you realize how serious this is. The necklace has fallen into the hands of thieves and forgers. The jewelers believe it was delivered to me. De Rohan says he put it into my hands. The whole wretched mystery must be dragged into the light. De La Motte and her accomplices arrested, de Rohan sent to the Bastille. A trial? If you should lose it... If the court should believe this amazing story... It could destroy me. It could destroy the monarchy, madame. You sent for me? You have great influence, cousin. You're using it against me in the trial of the prince de Rohan. You're using your money to bribe the judges. We appeal to you to support the throne. I find that very satisfying, madame. And the inducement? The king is without a minister of state. Oh, really? I'm afraid the bribe is not high enough. - Not high enough? - No. Louis, will you allow me to propose my solution for the troubles of the state? I should be grateful. Abdicate. - Abdicate? - Abdicate. No one can be a monarch who wears his crown without pride... ...without pleasure and without dignity. Oh, the country would accept the Dauphin with enthusiasm... ...under a regency. Under the regency of the duke de Orl?ans, I suppose? Why not, madame? I am a power in Paris. I have the confidence, yes, even the disgusting affection, of the mob. Monsieur, this is treason. Madame, it is the truth. Louis, will you permit me to request the duke de Orl?ans to withdraw? Then our truce fails? Very well, madame. You will lose your case. The high court of parliament will brand the queen of France... ...a loose and extravagant woman who stoops to midnight rendezvous... Get out! Get out or I'll knock you down. Get out. Au revoir, Louis. Take care that famous necklace doesn't twist around your fat neck... ...and jerk you from the throne. Madame, au revoir. When a throne falls... ...princes are apt to tumble with it, cousin. Goodbye. I have just come from Paris, Your Majesty. There are vast crowds around the courthouse. Intense excitement. The trial of the prince de Rohan may close at any moment... ...and the verdict give rise to public demonstrations. The lieutenant of police advises... ...against Your Majesty's appearance at the opera tonight. But the performance is for charity, under my patronage. - But, Your Majesty, there... - Monsieur de Cosse. I have given my word to attend, and I must do so. I wonder she dare show her face. Justice! Justice is done! The verdict! The verdict! The prince de Rohan is honorably acquitted! Justice! De Rohan acquitted! Justice! De Rohan acquitted! One million, two hundred thousand francs cost the necklace. She plunders us. She robs. She hangs our money around her neck. She should have a millstone around her neck. - And then into the water with her. - Yes! The queen hates the people. Foreign soldiers are at Versailles. Austrian soldiers to shoot us down. Before that happens we'll tear the Bastille down. Have you proof? If not, keep silent. Hear the spy. "Proof." He who asks for proof is a spy. Friends, keep cool. The law has prevailed today. But this is only the beginning. I am pleading your cause in the assembly. France will be freed. "By order of the king. We, Louis, by the grace of God, King of France... ...hereby decree as follows: The assembly is to close its session at once... ...and is adjourned indefinitely." - No. - No! Monsieur President! Monsieur President! Monsieur Mirabeau. We are here by the will of the people... ...and we shall stay here until bayonets will drive us away! - No, I tell you, no. - But these are the dregs of Paris, sire. The scum of the gutters, 10,000 strong. Beasts that have tasted blood, sire. I am not going to run. What do you say, brother? - Run and you'll lose your crown. - Stay and you'll lose your head. - You're on the wing. - Your trunks are packed. Liar. I don't turn tail before swine. Be quiet. Be quiet, both of you. It was a grave mistake to dissolve the assembly. It was not your wish, Louis. Your ministers advised you to do so. They thought it was for the best. My dear, what should we do? Haven't we troops to protect us? No, no. No bloodshed. I won't have any bloodshed. I can't answer for my men. Their sympathies are with the mob. If the king would review the troops, say a few words. They're children, easily swayed. - It's worth trying. - You want me to talk? Just a few simple words. Say that you trust your children to them. That if there must be fighting you'll be amongst them. Won't you try? It's so important. If we save today, we may save everything. - Will they listen? - To you, yes. You're their king. The love and loyalty of centuries can't be dead in them. Try for our son's sake. I'll try. Present arms! Men of the French army... ...we are told that... We are told that they are coming. I mean, naturally, the people. My cause is that of us all... ...that of all good citizens. We should make a good fight. Don't you think? Well, I thought... That is, the queen thought... ...that I should speak a few words. So I've spoken few words. Back to your sty, pig! Fight your own battles, fatty! - Men... - Your Majesty, I beg of you. Sire. Go on back to the queen where you belong! They're fleeing! They're fleeing! Here we are! Ah, brother, traveling? If they should be killed, I should be king. If you should be killed, I should be king. In these days, who knows? Adieu, brother. What, not gone yet? Gone? I shan't be much help to you, I know, but... You have my permission to leave. Your Majesty was good enough to trust me... ...with the care of these children. My place is here. Th?rese, I want you to go. I command you. Please don't ask me to go. I can't. Oh, I know I'm helpless and stupid... ...but I can't go. I'm sorry I'm such a coward. Yes. It's a pity you're such a coward. Antoinette... Attention! Affix bayonets! Sire. Save yourself, sire. The children. Well, what's the matter with you? There they are. The fat pig himself. And the foreigner. Are you afraid of them? - No! - Well then, come on. What are we waiting for? Remember what Marat said. They're starving us. And hiring foreign troops to shoot us down. Come on! Quiet, please, I'm going to talk! I'm going to talk! Is it sane for us to sit here... ...while the king and his family are torn to pieces by maniacs? Now. Traitor! What are they paying you? Sit down! Sit down! We don't want to hear you! Well, you shall hear me! Do you think that I, Danton, am pleading for the life of this clod... ...who has sat blind and deaf to the agony of his people? - Let him die! - For shame! When the time comes... ...l'll fling his head to you with these hands. Austria is arming, and France is not ready. The king and queen are invaluable hostages. And I say... ...we should send the National Guard to protect them until such time. The cap of liberty, Louis. Put it on! - Put it on! - Louis. Or I'll stick you like I would any other pig. You brutes. You cowards! Is this your liberty? You'll be punished for this, I promise you. You'll be whipped like the beasts that you are! - Shut up! - You mustn't do that. It's not right. You mustn't strike a woman. It's cowardly. Oh, you mustn't do that. It isn't right. People declare the Tuileries Palace a prison. The king and queen are held here. Nobody gets out, nobody gets in. No questions asked. Shoot to kill. Yes? Would you follow me, madame? A few steps only. Someone is waiting. Someone is waiting? I was to give you this. Is it...? Is it he? I'll come. Down there, madame. I must get back to my post. Thank you. I can... I can hardly believe it. It's been such a long time. Such a long time. But you haven't forgotten us? No, madame. But you're risking your life. We're prisoners here. We're not permitted friends. You have friends who would be glad to risk their lives, madame. Why did you come? To beg you to lay a plan of escape before the king. Escape? Is that possible? There are risks, of course. But you're in certain danger if you remain. The king must leave Paris. He must escape to the border. He'll be met with the support of loyal troops. - But how can this be done? - I haven't time to explain now. I've written complete details of all the plans. When you've mastered them, burn the paper. Here are passports made for Madame de Korff... A Russian... . her children, and servants. But every exit of the palace is guarded. How are we to leave? For that we must depend upon a friend outside. He's stationed at one of the few exits that has only a single guard. That leads to the square, where I shall be waiting with a coach. And all this is planned for when? For the night of June 20th. - June the 20th. - Time is vital, though. A troop of hussars will wait outside Varennes... ...to escort you safely to the border. But the delay, even of an hour, might dislocate the entire plan. If we failed, if we were taken... We must not fail. Must you go? I must leave before the guard is changed at midnight or I'll endanger our friend. - You can trust this man? - Yes, madame. He is loyal? Loyal and brave. Loyal and brave. A man of the people. But one who would be proud... ...to carry out a boast that many make but few have the chance to fulfill. - And that? - To die gladly for the woman... For the queen he worships. Thank you. I've changed, haven't I? One must suffer to be so beautiful. You're very kind. May I have the ring? You gave it to me, you know. You've been so much in my thoughts these last weeks. I think I've known you would come. - You promised to, you know. - lf you needed me, I said. Yes. You said that. And I said I would ask you: "Was it well done?" It was well done. My husband has needed me. I am thankful not to have failed him. I understand. I even love him. But the love I have for him takes nothing from my friend. Of all there was between us the night you went away... ...nothing has changed. For me nothing has changed, or ever will. Forgive me for telling you this without asking you... ...if you have the right to hear it. I have the right. We knew each other only for a few hours... ...and have been parted for long years. But the memory of you has always... ...will always, stand in the path of any living woman. Good night, madame. - I want my sword. - Hush, darling. Later. But Mama said I could have my sword. Hurry, sire, hurry. The gate to the alley. - That is all, Louise. - Good night, madame. The drums again. Something must have happened. Will you go, please. I'm so sorry, madame. Madame seems nervous tonight. Madame, hurry, something has happened. - In a moment it may be too late. - Have my children gone? Yes, and the king. Please, hurry, madame. I won't be a moment. What is it? What has happened? I don't know, but there may be rumors. The guard is doubled, we can't take chances. Help me, please. My clothes, in that wardrobe. - Which wardrobe? - Over in the corner of the room. A grey wool dress and cloak, and a small hat. - I don't see them. - Oh, but do look. Hurry. A plain gray dress and a cloak and hat to match. - It must be there. - There's nothing like it. - A wrap with fur. - I must look myself. I'm sure I put them there. Oh, where's my head? I changed the place. That woman, she was suspicious. She's been watching me all day. There they are. Hat, there's the cloak. Toulan, help me please. I shall never be able to get into this by myself. I'm afraid it does up at the back. Do you think you could fasten it for me? Oh, dear, oh, dear. - I shall never be ready. - With your permission, madame. Just a hook here and there will do. - Just stand still, madame. - I'm sorry, Toulan. I shall never forget your loyalty and your kindness. - Someday perhaps I shall be able... - Your cloak, madame. They're doubling the guard, madame. In a moment I shall have a companion. - Do hurry, madame. - I'm coming, Toulan. Wait, madame. Guard halt. Private Dupres. Forward march. - Evening, comrade. - Evening. What's in the air, doubling the guard? I don't know, unless... Don't move. Don't speak. Madame. All right, madame. Thank you, Toulan. The Austrian. You know that I shall have to talk. You will have no chance to talk till the guard is changed. - And that'll give them six hours' start. - You know what this will mean for you? I know, I know. But it was worth it. Your passports. Party of five, bound for Montmedy. Madame, her two children and servants. Passports. "Madame de Korff, a Russian subject of... For the border." - Madame de Korff? - I am Madame de Korff. And these are your children? Yes, monsieur. Sophie Rochet? Governess to my children. Dupont. Pass on. I rely on you. Yes, monsieur. - We're at the crossroads, sire. - Already? I was to leave you here. But I beg you to exercise the greatest caution. We shall drive with all speed. Thank you, Count Fersen. We shall not forget. Sire. Goodbye, my friend. We shall meet again. God be with Your Majesties. Louis, be careful, don't show yourself. - Oh, look, a smithy. - Hush, dear. Madame may like to have some refreshment? - I have a roast on the spit. - Thank you, no. - We should be on our way. - Your horses are ready. It will be 20 francs. Twenty francs for the horses. Oh, yes, I have to pay, don't I? I'd like to be a smith. Would you, young gentleman? My father's a locksmith. Hush, dear, hush. Will you have them hurry, please? Look alive there. What's that? What does it mean? It means, "To live in freedom or to die." You're on your way, citizens. That man. There was something sinister about him. Tell them to make speed. I shan't rest until we reach the escort. Ten o'clock and no sign of them. A louis d'or. One doesn't come by a gold piece every day. From the folks in the big carriage? The boy said his father was a locksmith. A locksmith, that's a good one. That little aristocrat. A locksmith... Guillaume, may I be hanged for a fool. I let him get away. The king, it was the king. - I knew his face. - King? He was here, in the big carriage. By heaven, the queen too, and the children. Are you mad? Those hussars who rode through here at dusk. - I said they meant no good. - An escort. He is flying to the border to come back with foreign troops. And I let him go. - We must follow him. - But he has an hour's start. - And which road has he taken? - To Varennes. The escort took the road to Varennes. A postillion told me. What could have delayed them? Look. No, right over here to the right. Through the woods there. A message, perhaps. - We must be ready. - Right. - To horse. - To horse! Look, the escort. Now I know it was the tyrant. - What shall we do? - Follow me, I'll show you. - Colonel, the king. - Your message, quick. He is detained at Sainte-Menehould. Three leagues back. - Who are you? - Drouet, postmaster. Late of the king's dragoons. Guillaume, my friend, I vouch for him. The great coach stopped to change horses. - The king was seen. - Go on, man. Someone started to cry, "It's the king!" - The coach was surrounded... - Attention! Force, right! Go through the woods, you cut three miles. - Guillaume will lead you. Guillaume. - Forward! Forward! We're nearly there. Are you sure? Let me see. Here are the hills we've just left and there are the woods... ...where they wait to take us through Varennes. Once we reach them, we're free. Free. How about a little kiss, young man. Steady, I said a little one. Darling. We must be there. It's very still. I see no escort. What could have happened? They have gone back through the woods. Their tracks are plain. We can't go through the town without them. At this hour of the night, it will be safe enough. Drive on. Please clear the way, we're in a hurry. Yes, we know you are. I'm Sauce, mayor of the town. Let me see their passports. Your passports? Passports, Dupont. I hope we shall not be delayed, monsieur. If the passports are in order, you can proceed immediately. - They say it's the king. - It is the king. - There's someone who'd know. - Here? Our priest was in the Versailles chapel. Fetch him, bring him here. Hurry, my friend, you can save France. Your name, monsieur? His name is Dupont, my steward. He's got a tongue of his own, hasn't he? Dupont. And you, madame? Sophie Rochet, governess to madame's children. I see no reason to detain these people. Their papers are in order. Papers can be forged. - He's right. - How are we to know? I tell you, this is the king. If you let him escape to a foreign country... ...you'll be guilty of treason, and you'll die for it. Citizens, listen to me. I've good reason to believe the king is in this coach... ...bound for the border and over the border, and why? To join our enemies. To lead foreign troops against France. To take from us by force the liberty we've fought for. I say he shall not pass. - But this man Dupont... - Let the people see this man Dupont. Let them see him. If he's not the king, why should he be afraid to show his face? Ask him to get out of the coach. He can't object to that. Please step down a moment. I regret, madame. It will quiet the people. Make way. Back up, back up. That fellow's the king? He's crazy. Let me get a look at him. Where's the man who said he was king? That sweating pig is the king? Then I'm Cleopatra. Way, please, way. Drouet has asked to see the father. This way, Father, this way. The priest will know. Ask him to step down again, your Dupont. Monsieur, I regret. Sire. Over there. Wait a minute. Why are we here? This is a prison. Take off your hat. Louis Capet, wife and two children. - Who is this woman? - The so-called princess de Lamballe. You will conduct her to the prison of La Force. No. Th?rese! My children. Go to your mother. Th?rese! Monsieur, it's not safe. Won't you protect her? Take them away. Goodbye, Antoinette. Th?rese! Follow me. All right, go on, go on. Are we gonna stay here? Just for a little while, darling. - What is it? - Don't go, I'll look. What is it, Louis? - It's only the palace guards, don't look. - Th?rese! Th?rese! What are they doing to you, Th?rese? My dear, I beg you not to look. Let me go! Mama. If the tree of liberty must be watered by blood... ...then I say blood must flow generously. You tell me that enemies of liberty perish in scores upon the scaffold. But the symbol of monarchy remains alive. The symbol of restoration. Citizens, in the name of the republic... ...I demand the life of that symbol, Louis Capet. Citizen Marat. Your vote. Death. Citizen LaRue. Eternal justice forbids us to condemn Louis Capet to death. I vote for imprisonment. No! Citizen Robespierre. Death. Citizen Orl?ans. Citizen president... ...fellow citizens, I... I can but ask myself why, of all men in this convention... ...it must be I who am placed in this agonizing situation. If I cast my vote for the supreme penalty, why... ...I shall be responsible for the death of my kinsman. But if I vote for imprisonment... ...I shall be unfaithful and shall betray the cause... ...to which I am prepared to sacrifice my own life... ...as readily as the lives of others. Citizen president... ...fellow citizens... ...I have searched my soul and my conscience... ...and it is with anguish in my heart that I must vote... ...death. You're laying for four. I was told to set a place for your husband. Will he have supper with us? My dear. Oh, it's so good to be together again. Oh, the children will be so happy. Why did they let you come? Are you going to stay with us? Louis. Louis. My dear, I thought they'd told you. Come, we don't want any fuss, do we? The children. When? Tomorrow, early. My dear, you mustn't. I'm not afraid, you know. This is the hardest part. Oh, no, no, no. I can't believe it. No. We've been together quite a few years, haven't we? You've been very good to me. It's easy to be good to those we love. I think you have loved me a little. There's more than one way of love. I have loved you, truly, deeply. Believe me, dear. Thank you. I've been brought very low. But I've had the love of the finest woman in the world. And tomorrow, I shan't be humbled. - Papa. Sister, sister, Papa is here. - Papa. My son. And my little mouse. What, crying? That's a nice way to greet your father. She's a silly, isn't she? You're gonna stay with us, aren't you, Father? The whole evening. - And play with us after supper? - Yes, my son. - That'll be fun. - Darlings, come and sit down. Supper is being served. And I'm hungry. I'm so glad you're going to stay with us, Papa. Look, my father has come to have supper with us. A chair for my father. That's all right, son. Onion soup. Oh, I like that. Did you hurt your little self? There. There. Oh, Papa, wait till I show you. Look, the general's lost his arm. Poor old General Pulverschmecken. What? What did you call him? General Pulverschmecken. Pulverschmecken? Mama, did you hear that? This is General Pulverschmecken. Sister, that's General Pulverschmecken. - Can you mend him? - Yes, I think so, son. I shall need a bit of wire. Let me take the old general away with me... ...and I'll send him back to you in the morning. Can't you bring him back yourself? Maybe, son. Who knows? Now, I'll put the old general in my pocket. There, you see? He's as snug as you please. Come along, we're letting the soup get cold. Oh, Lord, our heavenly father, we thank thee for the blessings... ...that thou, in thy infinite goodness and mercy... ...have seen fit to bestow upon us, thy humble servants. We ask thee to guard and keep us steadfast... ...in the ways of righteousness until the end of our days... ...and then to receive us into the eternal glory of thy grace. Amen. - Mama. - Mama. - Mama. - What is it? Children... These things belonged to your husband. He asked me to bring them to you. Not that it's any of my business. General Pulverschmecken. Papa mended him. Look, sister, Papa mended him. Old General Pulverschmecken. Yes. Old General Pulverschmecken. I have here an order of the house... ...authorizing me to remove the late Capet's son... ...from the custody of his mother. What did you say? The convention's voted to take your son away from you. We've come to fetch him. You mean you're going to take my little boy away from me? No. You can't mean that. Not today, when you've taken his father. You have children yourselves. Perhaps you have hearts, you're not merciless. Mama, don't let them take me, I don't wanna go. No, darling, no. You shan't go. They shan't take you. - Mama, please. - Charles, don't be frightened. It's all right, mother won't let you go. Sorry, but the assembly gave us orders. - . We must carry them out. - Let them go! - Let go! - Mama! Mama, mama! Mama... Don't think I'd let you have my son! Go back to the fiends that sent you. Tell them I won't give up my child! Never, never, never while I have breath in my body! Come, madame, all this is useless. We won't harm the child. Why won't you be sensible and let him go quietly, since he must go? But not today. Surely you won't take him today. Have pity, there's no one else to help. Plead for me. Surely you can make them understand. Madame. Just not today. Give me a little time, I'll be braver then. Just a little time, but not today, not now. Madame, we have our orders. The child will be well enough. Let him go, or the guards will take him. Don't let me go... Let him go, madame. You're distressing him uselessly. Calm yourself for his sake. Don't cry, darling. Don't cry. There's... There's nothing to be afraid of. Mother's a great crybaby, isn't she? But you are a man. You have to be very brave. Sister will get your coat and hat. And these gentlemen will be very kind to you, I'm sure. Won't you? And soon we'll all... Soon we'll be together again. Stand up, dear. Okay, darling. Say goodbye to your sister. May God take care of you, my baby. Yes, yes. We're ready, aren't we, dear? Goodbye, Mama. Mama, mama! Mama! You are Jean Laporte, journalist from Marseille? Passport in order. Pass on. And these, Your Excellency? Stay where you are. There's someone on the terrace. Fersen, in heaven's name. Why did you come? It's death. There's a warrant out for your arrest. Were you seen? Watch the door. If you were found, you'd be torn to pieces. Here, in this room, I told her how as a boy I'd dreamed... Why are you here? There's no hope abroad, no help from Austria, none from Europe. But here. Here there must be a way, with money, with audacity. Audacity? Man, people are crazed with fear. - The scum. - No one is safe. Your enemy drops a slip of paper into a box tonight... ...and tomorrow you're on your way to the guillotine. The leaders are at each other's throats. Yesterday, the citizen Orl?ans was arrested. Adored Philippe ?galit?. He'll go to the scaffold. That is good to hear. Tomorrow, Danton will follow him. It's chaos. All that is good, I tell you. In a mad world, one can do a mad act and win with it. But you must help me. You, her friend, her countryman. We must act, rally our friends, bribe. I have money. Devise a plan. Fersen, the woman in the Conciergerie is not the woman you remember. I've loved her since she was a child. But if it were in my power to save her life, I wouldn't lift my hand. Nothing has been spared her, nothing. - Her own son... - The child? They brought him into court today. She seemed to live again at the sight of him. Into court? They put into his mouth the foulest charge... ...a child could bring against his mother. I saw her heart break. You saw her? Where? She was brought to trial three days ago, convicted less than an hour since. She'll be executed in the morning. I am Count Fersen, who planned the escape of the royal family. I came to Paris with a plan to rescue the queen. I was too late. I am here to surrender. Why? Why do you tell me this? Isn't there blood enough shed, that I should want yours? I'm asking a kindness of you... ...for which I'll exchange everything I posses. My life. - Let me speak to the queen. - Are you insane? For months she has waited in darkness and silence... ...without a sign that any friend remembered. And now she is alone, waiting to die, without a friendly hand, a word of pity. You have my sympathy, monsieur. I have forgotten your name. Give me 10 minutes to tell her she's not forgotten. - Impossible. - Ten minutes, five, a moment. Is there no mercy for the dying? A word, a look, in exchange for my life. Is it time? I hardly knew you. My eyes, you know. It's been so dark here. It isn't that I've forgotten, you know. I just feel so little now. So little. He looked so small in that big chair... ...whispering the lies they'd told him. When he's older... ...do you think he'll know I understood? If he remembers, he will know. You mustn't feel badly, I... I don't think I'll be afraid. It's quick, they say. Don't be sad. Don't be sad, my darling. We... We will never say goodbye. - Oh, Marie. - We... We just have to leave each other for a little while, that's all. - Austrian! - Shut up! Oh, Mama, think of it. I shall be queen. I shall be queen of France.
