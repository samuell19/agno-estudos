The American public annually spends more than four billion dollars in the nation's great department stores. Some pay cash for their merchandise. Others use the installment plan, and a few try shoplifting, a criminal practice annually amounting to 100 million dollars. Shoplifters come from all walks of life. Temptation and opportunity lie for them wherever merchandise is displayed. Of every 10 shoplifters apprehended by the law, nine are women, only 10% are professionals, but this 10% account for more than 80% of the losses. Among the professionals, those who attempt to eke out a living by the practice, are many drug addicts, and among the amateurs, are some who are mentally ill and unable to control their impulses to steal. Described sometimes as kleptomaniacs, they often are tempted by the mere glitter of things, often by the touch and feel of things, and sometimes by a button, a spool of thread, or a mere bag or tote, which to them may mean more than all the riches they might possess. This is the story of one such person. - Yes? - Send an operator to the glove department immediately. - Okay. - Armstrong. - Shoplifting suspect. Check the glove department, main floor. - Okay. - The girl in the Polo coat. - Be careful. Oh, pardon me. I wasn't kidding back there. You're being watched. - I beg your pardon. - I'll diagram it for you. You're stealing things, and people are watching you. May I help you? - Oh, no thanks. We're helping ourselves. - Will you please step back into the store? - Why, what do you want with me? - You've forgotten to pay for something. Now, lady, let's don't have a scene. - For your own sake please come quietly. - You better come along too, buddy. - Wait a minute I'm not with her. - You are now. - Now don't tell me it's your first time. You start with Shoelaces and handkerchiefs. Not by taking $22 ceramics and $15 fountain pens. And why can't you boyfriend steal his own pipes? - He's not my boyfriend. - Who is he? - I don't know. - She doesn't need a boyfriend. She has a bank book, a big, fat one. - Faye Burton, age 22. First offense. Faye Burton? Yes, I've heard of you. You're Judge Burton's daughter. - Please, can't I just pay for everything? I don't know Why I did it. - Don't ask me. You've got plenty of money in the bank. You're well-dressed. That's supposed to make you a kleptomaniac. The ones in old clothes are just common thieves, but you, you're a kleptomaniac. Anyway, sign this confession. - No, please believe me. I promise I'll never take anything again. I know I deserve it, but please don't arrest me. - How can I get in touch with your father? - He's in Europe. - This will be a nice homecoming present for him. - Good morning, Mr. Dunson. - Good morning. It's excellent that you told me over the phone there were two of them. - He's in the other room. Bring the man in. - Did you search him? - Yes, sir, nothing on him, but he was carrying this booster box. - You're tampering with the mail, sonny. That box is sealed for shipment to my mother. - Wait a minute. I thought he looked familiar. You just sent this out to me yesterday. - Yes, we got it from our San Francisco office. A nice record. - Enough to keep him out of circulation for a few years. - Get everyone out on the floor. He's probably moved in with a gang that's been carting off half our store while we amuse ourselves with kleptos. I want you to sign this confession, and then get out of here. Don't let us catch you again. - You mean you're not going to arrest me? - Miss Burton, I'm head of the store's protective association. What you've done is misdemeanor. Good for a nice turn in the county jail, but this signed confession could be used to put you into Hachepi, on a felony charge. - If we get you again. - It's a good idea to be a little frightened right now. You can go now. - Your bank book. - I'm gonna take him along with me, Klaxon. I wanna see if I can break him down, or maybe you'd rather have the boys at central do it? Come on. Well, how'd it go? - Nothing to it. - Yes? - Send Palm in. This is Lieutenant Palm. - How are you, Lieutenant? - He'll work as our outside man on this. I've just taken him off another case to help you out. - Lieutenant, there's a gang of shoplifters operating up and down the West Coast. They cost the stores I represent over five million bucks last year. - How do you know it's one gang? - By the way they work. We've picked up a few of them. They've all been trained the same way. - Trained, huh? - We figure they got a regular school where they give the background. We know the headquarters is somewhere around here. - How do they get rid of the stuff? - That's a good question. - They've got a fence somewhere that we don't know anything about. They dump their stuff fast, and we haven't been able to get a trace. - How about the ones you've picked up? - They're all amateurs, no records. They don't know anymore about the set up than we do. - Soon as they get picked up, the gang dumps them. - How does the gang know they've been picked up? - That's another good question. - How does he fit in? - I brought Jeff over from our training school. He's a teacher there in criminal psychology. We phonied up a record for him. He's been hanging around the stores looking for a chance, and today he got it. They picked up a klepto, and Jeff got himself arrested along with her. - What do you intend doing? - Well, it's just a long shot, Lieutenant. We know this gang gets ahold of these amateurs someway. - After they've been picked up? - We've run across about five cases of it already. - We pick up a klepto. Then we let him go with a warning, and a few weeks later, we pick him up again. Only by this time, they're all trained in booster suits and heisting boxes. - Well, got to start somewhere. - What are we after? - The fence mostly. We break that up they won't be able to operate. - If they know where to contact these amateurs, you must have a leak in one of your stores. - Yeah, it looks like it. But, they're all my men. I supply the detectives for all our stores. I checked them and I cross checked them. I can't find anything wrong. - Well, anything else? - It's his show. I hope you know what you're doing. - Me too. Look, I want this girl that was picked up with me today followed, so when they try to contact her, I'll have a lead which way to move. - And if they don't? - We try again with somebody else. - Will we let the girl in on this? - Nobody's in on this. Dunson hasn't even told his own men. - Anything else, Lieutenant? - No, but don't get me wrong. I'm not old fashioned enough to laugh at criminal psychology. But, I think, this is going to take more practical work than theory. - You have the time, Lieutenant? - Yeah, it's... - They teach a few practical things at the training school too, Lieutenant. There you are, Jimmy. I think you'll like this. Thank you, Miss Burton. Tell me, is this interesting? - I'm sorry that's a reference book. It can't be taken out. Oh, I imagine it can if you know the right people. You must've taken it home a few nights yourself. - I don't understand. - I think you do, Faye. - Who sent you here? - Nobody. I just wanted to meet you. We have a lot in common. - Are you from the police? - Now do I look like a policeman? - But the store, Mr. Klaxon, he let me go. - After you signed the confession. Bad things to be leaving around, confessions. - But he promised. - Anybody can make a promise just like I'm gonna make you one now. How would you like to get your confession out of Klaxon's files? - How? - What do you care how? You'd like to get it back, wouldn't you? - I'd pay almost anything. - You probably will. I wanna talk to you away from this tomb. - I'm through here at 6:00. - You come and see me. - But I don't even know who you are. - I'm a girl who knows a lot of things about you, things I don't think you'd like anybody else to know about. But, I... I really don't think that-- You'll be there tonight. - Where? - The address is on the cover. Eight o'clock's a good hour, and anytime after that I may be on the phone calling some newspaper friends of mine. - I'll be there. - Just ask for Ina Perdue. I'll read up on your case a little. - Pardon me, Miss. -Hmm? - Is there a smoking room around? - Oh, no, sir, you'll have to go outside. - Say, could I borrow those matches? I'm fresh out. - Why certainly. - You're not going out tonight, Faye. Did you understand me? You're not going out tonight. The girls are coming in to play Canasta. - Please, Aunt Clara, let's not have another scene. - Library business at night. How can you expect me to believe that? - Then why do you force me to lie just to get away alone one night? - You're using too much lipstick. Take some off. - Look I'm nervous enough. I'm responsible for you while your father's away. - I think, I'm old enough to be my own responsibility. - Certainly don't act like it sometimes. Taking that silly job instead of going abroad with your father. - The job at the library might be silly to you, but it's the only thing I've ever gotten completely on my own. - After all your father and I have tried to do for you. - But I don't want things done for me. Can't you understand that? - All right, you step out of this house tonight, and I'll see that you leave that silly job. - Then we will have it out, Aunt Clara. Nobody's taking the library away from me. At least, not without a real fight. - How can you do this? Deliberately stand against me! - Can't I have something that you don't give me? At least, one thing of my own! - Now, now, clear, you're all upset. We'll have a nice quiet evening together, and then I'll send the girls home early. - If you do, you'll be all alone. - There's a man behind this, isn't there? - I wish it were that! - Faye. Faye? Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to frighten you. - Didn't they send you to jail? - I'm out on bail. - Well, how did you know where I lived? - I heard in Klaxon's office. - Did you send that woman to see me today? - Nope. Let's get in the car. - Well, all right I'll drop you off. I've got to meet someone. Are you really a professional shoplifter? - That's what it says on my record. - Then why did you wanna see me? - Well, maybe I like your looks? Maybe I'm just a moonstruck kid. Maybe I thought we could have a beer and compare methods of operation. - I have no method. This is something that I can't explain. - Okay, well, don't try it again until you've practiced up a bit. Say, how about this woman who came to see you today? - I don't know who she is. She said her name was Ina Perdue. She told me she could get my confession out of the files. - A nice girl to know. How much does she want? - I don't know. I'm going to see her now. You seem to know about these things. What will she want? - Plenty, if she can do it. - But I've got to get it back. - That's just what she figures. How would you like some company? Maybe she could do something for me. - But I don't know anything about you. - Well, sure you do. You heard my references when Dunson pulled that file on me. Of course, I could tell you more, how I fell into evil companions when I was eight, had my own gang of blackmailers when I was 10. From then on it was just a lot of hard work. - Oh, don't be funny. She may not like it if I bring someone else along. - Well, I'll just skulk around in the background. Besides, sometimes it's handy to have a friend along. - What's your name? - Danny the Dip, but you can call me Jeff. - I'm looking for Miss Perdue. - Welcome, senorita. Your first drink will be free. Compliments of Pepe. - Where can I find Ina Perdue? - Ina? So you're a friend of Ina's, huh? Well, we're gonna get along just fine. My name is Pepe. You heard of me. - I'm to see her on business. - Okay, okay. Well, what's the name, baby? - Faye Burton. - Miss Faye Burton. Well, all right then. Upstairs. And, uh, Pepe will see you later, huh? - Your intentions are showing, pal. - Come on in. - Can't we talk downstairs near the music? - No. Barkie, you entertain the young lady. I've got to go downstairs. - Sure! - But I don't have very much time. - Just stay right here like I tell you. You might show her some pictures to pass the time. - Sure! So you're the librarian, huh? Rich girl librarian and part-time shoplifter. That's a nice parlay. - Won't you please tell me what this is all about? - We arranged for a photostat of your confession just to show we weren't kidding. - Well, where's the original? - Right where we can get it for you in case you decide to be a good girl. But these are good enough to send to your father or the newspapers. - But what do you want? - Just sit down and relax like Ina said! You know, your old man sent me up for two years once. - I don't know anything about my father's business. - Funny how things work out. Yeah, pal, I used to drink champagne like I drink beer now. Then my steel companies went broke. My wife went south with all my war bonds, and my horse ran last in the derby. - Yeah, women, horses, and steel companies ain't to be trusted. - Uh-uh. - I put all my spare cash in charity work. - Oh, yeah? Like buying a beer for a starving drunk? - Are you broke, Mister? - No, I'm just conservative. You see, I pitch pennies instead of tossing for them, but I might loosen up with enough to buy you a beer though. I wouldn't want to upset your budget. Anyway, we always buy a couple of rounds for a new customer. - Well, thanks. You work here? - I'm afraid I own the place. - Well, shake hands with a man who's never been prejudiced about beautiful women having money. - I'm Ina Perdue. - Oh, and I bet Mr. Perdue isn't kicking about then? - Not often. - Jeff Andrews. - Where you from, Jeff? - Oh, I just came back from Russia where I've been trying to negotiate a loan for Uncle Sam. - How did you do? - Uh-uh, I think their boats only run one way. - What'd you do before that? - Look let's not talk about me. Tell me, what do you do for amusement while Mr. Perdue is busy counting his blessings? - Oh, I sit around and read a few good books, and I try to entertain the customers. - Oh, all of them? - The ones who interest me. You gonna be around? - Will you be coming back? - Well, I have a few things to attend to first. Will you wait? - Honey, I'll homestead this stool. - Hey, Bill. Match? - Yeah. Hey, you picked my pocket! Seven bucks isn't much, but it's enough! Come on, give me back my dough! - Take it easy, stupid. - Give me my dough! - Get off me. - We'll take him upstairs. - Stay down. - Jeff? - All right, who is he? - I don't know he just drove me out here. - With you at the wheel? I thought I told you to come alone. - Being with me is practically the same thing. - Well, you didn't leave us for long. How do you fit in with this, junior? - Oh... Just perfect. Too perfect to be framed by that phony pickpocket routine, see. When I wire a touch, nobody gets wise. - Hold it, Pepe! - Yes, careless. Go back down to your rumba. - I'll see you later, guy. I mean it. - Make it soon, buster. I'm out on bail. - Well, my associates probably got you wrong. You sound as if you know what the score is. - Being one of the better counters in the country and having a record to prove it, I keep the score. - What's your connection with the librarian? You carry her books home? - Who's the big wheel around here? I only talk to him. - Then you're out of luck. Nobody talks to him except through us. - Barkie, we'll check the boss about this lovely man. - Right, if he's a professional, he's got a record. - Then what would you be doing with her? Admiring her taking ways? - Now listen, beautiful. There's no connection between us. We're just passing acquaintances, and I fumble the passes. - Champ, lock these two in the showroom. - What's she doing? Making that nickel to telephone your boss? - Hey, you want I should be your friend? Teach me a few touches about pickpocketing, huh? - Well, before you can be a wire, you have to have steady hands. - Hey. - Nervous, huh? Go get yourself a box of matches. - What the kind of steer is that. I wanna learn how to steal money not matches. - No, we have to limber up your fingers by practicing tying knots inside of a matchbox. - Oh, that's the way you start, huh? - That's the way you start. If you get stuck, I'll help you out. Well, we're locked in. Well, at least we haven't got the Champ's hot breath on our necks. - What are you doing in this thing? - Looking after you when I'm not getting lumps on my head. - But there's more to it than that. - Don't try to figure the criminal mind, Faye. - But, are you in it with them? - Oh, sure, that's why they beat me half to death. - They've got photostats of my confession. - They work smooth. - But they still haven't told me what they want. - They will. Judging from the looks of things, you're going to have to do a little shoplifting. - Oh, but I couldn't do that! Whatever you might think of me I'm not really a thief. - So you're not, and I am. You can still play along with them until you get back that confession. - But how do I know she'll keep her word? - You don't, but you haven't any choice, Faye, believe me. - Oh, I knew I shouldn't have come here. It was dishonest to even want my confession back her way! - Take it easy. Take it easy. Come here. Put your arms around me. Come here. Now look the room is wired, and they're listening, so just do what they tell you. - Well, talk the Champ into leaving, so you could steal a few kisses. How sweet. - It passes the time. - You always make time? -I try. What are you doing later? - Why don't you ask me later? - Oh, am I going to be around to ask? - The head man hasn't quite made up his mind about you. But you, you're lucky. The boss says give you another chance. You want to work with us? - When will I get the confession back? - That's in the head man's department. He's the store contact and final word. I'm just here to teach you how to shoplift. - We'll you'll get a liberal education anyway. Say, do you mind if I watch the training session? Nope, help yourself. - You can't be serious about all this. - You'd better be. So pay attention. You'll have homework too, and I ask questions later. - Say, how did you get into this racket? - Started out as an juvenile delinquent and worked my way up. Just lucky, I guess. Now watch. These are booster bloomers. Good for plenty, and a 15-year one-way stretch if you get caught wearing them in a store. This is your booster box for furs. Watch. If you practice enough, you can steal the shirts off their backs. - Yeah, when you get that good, I wear a 16 collar and a 36 sleeve. - I'll let her practice all night, since you get such a bang out to of it. How's you head? - Is that the way you entertain your customers? - Well, now, Jeff, you can't blame us too much. I asked you some straight questions, and I get nothing but double talk. - What do you think I do? Walk into a bar and start yelling about my record. - You didn't just walk in. You came with a girl. - So, does that rate a skull fracture? - That all depends. - I was picked up with her this morning. - I already know that. - Listen, I've been hanging around stores for weeks trying to get a lead to you. - Why? - I heard through the grapevine that you had a talent scout operating, so I just followed pigeons in the department stores until one led me to you. - And what else have you hear? - Enough to make me pack a gun to play safe. - What's your next move? - I'd like to get full-time employment in your organization. - We take our time about making up our minds. - Mmm, I haven't got much time. Either I jump in now, or go back to playing footsie with the judge. - You've got a couple of days. - So? - So, just relax. Enjoy the scenery. - Do I get my gun back? - No. - Why? - Later, maybe. This is my downtown address. Give me a call tomorrow. - Mmm, that takes care of tomorrow. What about the rest of tonight? - You better sleep off that bump on your head. - No dances, no champaign or anything to celebrate our being friends again? - Curb your boyish enthusiasm. We've got plenty of time to be friendly. - Round one goes to the lady's corner. - I'm not particularly interested in winning from you, Jeff. Goodnight. - Now listen. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - All right, lay off! - All right, now get this. Go back and tell your boss to quit sending a boy to do a man's job. If she wants to know where I'm staying, I'm at the Sunset Hotel downtown. And listen hard, stupid! If you ever pull a knife on me again, I'll whittle your ears off. Now go on, beat it! - Hop in, buddy. - You going as far as Laguna? - No, but I'll take you part way. - No, thanks, pal, I'll wait for the next one. - What do you want? Door-to-door delivery? - You going as far as Laguna? - Further to Oceanside. - Swell, that's just where I'm going. - Anything to report? - Yeah, I have a date to call the boss's wife, but instead of phoning I wanna surprise her in person. - I heard you were a fast worker, but after driving up and down this highway all night, I was beginning to think you had lost your sex appeal or something. Where is your date? - Well, he's their phone number and address. This outfit believes in match cover advertising. Another way to get in more pockets. - Okay, he's here. - Let's go, boys, open the bug. - Takes a couple of seconds to warm up, Lieutenant. - Which mic do you want first, Lieutenant? - The back of the store, her office. - But can't we get into trouble, Palm? We're out of county territory here. - What are you worried about? Bascom got clearance from the L. A. Police Department. - And this is isn't wire tapping. We squared it with the building superintendent, and planted our mics at 6:00 this morning. Here it comes. I told you to call me not to come here. Do you always just barge in on people? Well, I believe in the direct approach. Hmm, it's effective, but the results aren't always what you expect. I haven't had any complaints so far. - That's a matter of opinion. Was that nice of you to rough up poor Pepe last night? You've given him an inferiority complex. I see he delivered my message. - You must know how to handle yourself. Pepe's no amateur with a knife. Would you like to feel my muscles? - Later. Does that make you feel better? - Oh, yes, I was a little worried, you see, because a bunch of us were getting up a game of a Cowboys and Indians tonight. You must've checked up on me some more. - Maybe. - Well, do I get a job? - We don't use professionals as boosters. - Oh, I was aiming higher than that. I was thinking of something more in the, you know, the executive line. - Take your time. - Well, do I get to see the set up? - Some of it. Come on, kids, I'm in a hurry. - We got something real sharp for you today. Electric razor. - Where'd you pick her up? - She's okay. Ask Pepe, honest. - Well, I have something for you too. We're going partners. - Where you from, kid? - Beverly Hills. - But she got out of juvenile hall for finding a pocketbook. - Where'd you find these? In an oyster bed? - Oh, they're my aunt's. I live with her. She thinks she lost them. - Well, take this junk back. She paid too much for them in the five and ten. - Gee, I thought with this razor and jewelry, you'd sure give us some real credit. - Hey, Pepe. How much you figure this junk is worth, huh? - Depends on where he got the razor. Does it have a year's guarantee? - Hey, wait a minute. Shorty Kaiser got five bucks for a two-headed razor. This thing's got three heads. Closer shave. - Well, kid, five bucks for the razor. Snatch more razors and a good ring, and we'll see what we can do, huh? - Okay, you can get the ring? - Sure. See you tomorrow, if we can make it. - Keep your mouth shut, and you'll make it. - How you like? - Oh, too bit stuff. Kids, electric razors. - You think so. - What if any of these kids get caught, they'll yap like frightened puppies. - Oh, no, every once in a while, we accuse one of ratting. Rough them up good and the word gets around. Routine, you know. None of them talk. - Oh, I get it. Get enough of these kids working in 10 or 12 cities, and it adds up to quite a bit of spending money. But where does the loan company come in? - It's legitimate, and it's also a nice way of paying off our shoplifters. They come in supposedly for a loan, and we give them their percentage of the take. It's a nice, safe payoff. - And they never see the fence? - Never. - Well, how do you dump the stuff? - That's the beautiful part of the set up, and that's the part you don't see yet. - You don't trust me. - Or anybody else. - Well, uh, maybe I like being the exception. - I can like you without trusting you. Aren't you curious about what happened to your librarian? - Uh-uh, not since I met you. - She's good. We're gonna put her right out on a job. - Swell, if she makes good, maybe she can lend me five bucks. - Hmm, now, Jeff, I'd be hurt if you took money from another woman. - Well, you wouldn't be more hurt if you woke up one morning and found me starved to death? - Come over to the place tonight. We'll see if we can't find something for you to do. - Oh, well, find something all right. Incidentally, where's this husband of yours? - Right up here. I invent him every once in a while to keep away people I don't like. - Well, now, hearing that's like putting on a pair of rose colored glasses. - Well, keep them off until tonight. - Am I dismissed now? - That's right. Come in. Well, Pepe. How are things on the seamy side of life? - What are you doing here? - Well, I just thought you and I might go out and have a malted milk together. - Smart, aren't you? I'll never turn my back on you again. - Don't. - Listen, don't hang around him too much, will you? Some of it might rub off. Bye. What's he doing here? What do you care? I just don't like it that's all. I 'll worry myself sick about that. Well, I don't think it's smart to have him here. That's not for you to decide, Pepe, and after this just stay in your own department. - Shut it off. - Where are those... - Let's get ahold of Jeff and see what's next. - You better be careful, Lieutenant. - Now you're sure you'll have Faye watched all the time? - As close as we can. - We let the girl go sometime this morning, Jeff. She went home. - Everything's going fine. You're making progress. - Yeah, I don't want this girl exposed any longer than I have to. We better not meet again until we're ready to make an arrest. - Watch yourself. We're dealing with a very clever gang. If they get wind of anything, you're in trouble. - Will I really get the confession back after I do this? - I've told you that's not in my department. Anyway you're luckier than most of our beginners. You get a big job right away. - Why do I have to go to San Diego? - Use your head. You want to start working this town where you just got picked up? Nobody knows you down there. - For heaven's sakes, what can I tell my aunt? - It's Labor Day weekend. You're taking a vacation. When you get down there, check in someplace, and call the number I gave you and tell them where you are. They'll send you a list of stuff we want you to get. - Well, can't you give me the list now? - No, Barkie has to case the stores down there first. And quit asking so many questions. And get along because I'm expecting someone. - If I only knew for sure that I'd get the confession back. - Well, you don't. Here. Your nerves are on edge. Take one of these and you'll relax. Go ahead. - Ever think of turning on the ignition? How's school? - Jeff, I've got to talk to you. Well, I sort of have a date. - Please, Jeff, just a few minutes. I'll bring you right back. - Okay, but let's get out of here before she spots me. Move over. You see, kid, that's their angle. Barkie goes ahead and scouts the out-of-town stores. Then they bring the Los Angeles bunch down to work them. Then they probably have a San Diego bunch that comes up and works the Los Angeles stores. - Jeff, I can't go through with it. I'm frightened! - That's just stagefright on your first job. - I don't care what it is I can't do it. I've made up my mind I'm going to the police. - Faye, supposing I were to promise you that if you did this job, it'll be the last one you'd ever have to do? - How can you promise that? - Look, you go down to San Diego and I'll get your stuff for you. Then all you got to do is deliver it to them. You make the grade, I'll see that you get your confession back. - You're sure this is right, Jeff? - Trust me it is, and believe me, Faye, if you went to the police now, it would be extremely dangerous for you. - Oh, what difference does it make anyway, Jeff? I'm hopeless, I know that. - You're wrong. Now look, you go in and pack a bag. I'll drive you down. We'll stop someplace on the way and make a phone call so you can contact them tonight. - What about your date with Ina? I'll call her and break it. - I am at the Casa de Manana in La Jolla, cabana five. - All right, kid, you stay there. I'm sending someone out with your list and the rest of the instructions. Everything is to be picked up and delivered by one o'clock tomorrow afternoon, you got it? - All right. He's sending someone out with the list and some instructions. - Good. Now look, don't worry. I'll be right in the next cabin. - Jeff, couldn't you stay here for a while? I'm scared. - No, that wouldn't be smart. Besides, there's nothing to be afraid of. I'm taking care of everything from here on in. Now let me know as soon as he goes. - Who is it? - It's me, Pepe. Hiya, kid. Well, you're in the big league now. How does it feel? - Have you got a list for me? - Uh-huh. We gave you lot of easy stuff. Now don't get careless. Maybe we'll have a little celebration tonight. - I'm awfully tired tonight, Pepe. - Sure, sure. Good luck. - Jeff? - Faye. Faye. Faye. - It's hot. - Where did you get these? - Ina. - How many have you taken? - I don't remember. - You okay? You better get those wet clothes off and try to get some sleep. - Where are you going, Jeff? - Just to dry off. I'll be within calling distance. - Jeff. - Well, how you feeling? - Better. - Good. - I don't remember too much of what happened. - Well now, I'm not surprised. Do you feel well enough to listen to something? - Yes. - Well, I'm gonna try to make something right that was one of the most wrong things I've ever done. - What, Jeff? - You've been going around for the last few days taking a lot of chances. - Well, I had to. - You wouldn't if you had a choice. - But I didn't have a choice. - I could've stopped the whole thing, Faye. You see, I'm with the sheriff's office. - You? The sheriff's office? But, I don't understand. - We've been watching you ever since this thing started. But why me? - Someone had to lead us to them. We had to start somewhere. - Why didn't you arrest them then? - We haven't got all we want yet. We still have to find out where they get rid of the stuff they steal. - But you haven't finished yet. Why tell me now? - Well, there're a lot of reasons. First, I think you have the right to makeup your own mind whether or not you want to take anymore chances. - Well, I don't see that it makes any difference. - It makes all the difference in the world to me, Faye. - Oh, Jeff, nothings matters anymore. When they arrest them, everything's going to come out about me anyway. - Nothing is gonna come out about you. - If I do what? - That's just what I'm telling you. You don't have to do anything else. You're in the clear. I'll tear up your confession personally. - You know, you were awfully convincing as a pickpocket. - Yeah, I may have to go back to that yet if I don't pull this off. - And that's how you knew all those things about me. - Mm-hmm, see I've studied some criminal psychology. - Do you think that maybe I could-- - That you could be cured in nothing flat. - Oh, Jeff, I'll try to go through with the rest of it. - Uh-uh, not if it's going to affect you the way it has. - Well, it's sort of different now. What do you want me to do? - Just deliver to them the stuff that I get for you. Where? - It's in your instructions. A warehouse. - Where will you be? - Close enough if anything happens. - Jeff, you said there were a lot of reasons why you wanted me to know. So far you've only told me one. - Well, the others are far more important. - Sure, Bascom, all the cooperation you want. Just a minute I'll let you talk to him. - Hello, Sheriff Bascom, you better get down here. Can you make it before one o'clock? - Do you have everything set up? - Hold it a second. Will your boys be able to fill that list all right? - Yeah, they're making arrangements with the department store now. Let's be sure and get these items back, or it'll come out of my salary. - Everything's been taken care of by the San Diego sheriff office. Right. - Mmm, San Diego. Right now. - I'd better go with you. - No, you stay here. I'll keep in touch with you. - Klaxon, I'll go over those circulars with you later. - Operator, I wanna place a long distance call to San Diego. Main 4-3-2-3-8. That's right. - Park it here, baby. - Pepe, am I gonna see you tonight? - Not tonight and maybe no more. Come back in 10 minutes for the car, huh? Get lost now. - Check with Lieutenant Palm. Yes, sir. Lieutenant Palm, report to mobile unit X. - Receiving. Situation same. Signal Bascom. Faye's car is entering the parking lot. - Faye's car entering parking lot. - Faye's car entering parking lot. - Well, baby, where have you been? Ina's sore. - I was delayed. Why? - You'll find out. Pull into the warehouse. - You, get in the office upstairs there. Ina wants to talk to you. - So you decide to get here. - Ina, I did what you told me. Everything's in the back of my car. - Do you have Jeff in there too? - What would I be doing with Jeff? You know your habits better than I do, so he decided to let you take it all alone. - I don't know what you mean? - Don't give me that. We know who he is and who he's working for. It's a little late I'll admit, but that's not gonna do you any good. Champ. - Yeah? - Come here. - Okay. Yeah? - Put this doll in the back end of the refrigerator truck. Leave me alone. - On the truck? - Stop it! - Yes, if it doesn't take too long to penetrate that skull of yours. And get everybody moving. We're pulling out. Help him, Pepe. - Are we taking her with us? - Just for the ride not for you. Help! Help! - A five ton refrigerator truck. California commercial license number T-9-2-3-1.

If she's not in there, we've been tricked. - You're to follow operations as planned, Jeff. - Sorry, I can't sweat it out here. - I'd better stick with him, sir. We'll make contact later. - Um, contact San Diego Municipal Airport. Get the sheriff's observation plane in the air. - Yes, sir. - Lieutenant, we've been outsmarted. There's only one place she can be, in that truck. Hey! Help! Help! - We've got to contact Bascom. - What if we stop and inform the San Diego sheriff's office? - Well, we can't, Faye's in that truck. We've got to stop them before they get to the border. - What about the plan, Jeff? - I've got one of my own. - Observation plane to ground station.

Go ahead, Lieutenant. - Sheriff Bascom, we've just... - Sheriff Bascom, were you able to locate that truck yet? - Yes, they're at the port of entry now. - Well, the girl's inside that truck. You've got to get her out of there. - Sorry, Jeff, we can't let personal feelings into this. We must follow through as planned. - Well, can't you have the custom's officers make some kind of an inspection, so you can get her out of there? - If we stop them now and find the girl, our case ends right here. Don't worry, Jeff, I've got an observation plane on it. It won't let go. - Look give us an escort to the border, will you? And keep it wide open. - Pretty neat. I guess, they must inspect them once in a while, but on holidays and weekends they just wave them through. - It was close call, but we made it. - Maybe. - What makes you so sure they're here, Ina? - Let's just say it's a woman's intuition. - Then why did we run? - Because I didn't want to leave all the stuff there. - Boss's orders? - Yeah, and I want all this dumped before they get jurisdiction over us. Pepe, take her down to the basement and tie her up, and get back here to help the boys. - Work, work, work that's all you know. - Right this way, ladies and gentlemen.

It is somewhere on this side of the border, but it is now all right for you to join your party. Our officer will escort you. - Well, what happened? - You know, Jeff, on side of the border suspects are out of the US. jurisdiction.

I hope there ain't any hard feelings. - Hold it, Pepe. - The raid signal. I'll get the girl. - Wait a minute. - What about him? We'd better ditch him, no? - Why don't you two get smart? Don't you know they wouldn't have busted in until they'd surrounded the place? - But what are we gonna do? Stay here and get caught likes rats in a mousetrap? - We'd better get rid of him, huh? - And get picked up for murder instead of just shoplifting? But, they know too much. - Everybody knows everything already. - Ina, please ain't we even gonna try to get out of here? - And get shot down? No. We're gonna stay right here and get picked up nice and quiet like. - All right, now you all know about international law. If you don't wave extradition, you may be stuck down here for over a year or two. - As far as we're concerned, you can all rot down here. You're no danger to us anymore. - But remember this. If any of you wanna kick through with some information, we'll get you back and try to get you off life. - We know there's one more guy. We know he's one of the detectives at the Marsten Department store. He had to be to have access to Miss Burton's confession. - All right, suckers, we'll get him anyway. - We might as well go. - It's really a shame, Jeff. You would've made such a lovely crook. - Why don't you play it smart, Ina? - That's what I'm doing. You won't get the boy you're after. When he hears we've been picked up, he'll skip. - And what good is that gonna do you? - He's got plenty of money to play around with to get us out of here. - Don't depend on it. - I won't. But it's a good long shot. - So long, Ina. How's Faye? - Fine, she'll be ready to go back with us. - Can't we wind this up tonight, sir? - Yeah, we'll take a plane back, and pick up this guy before he finds out we got the others. Round up all the store detectives. We'll meet them in Klaxon's office in two hours. - Okay. - Yeah, I want this thing finished up in time for my honeymoon tomorrow. - So we know for sure that it has to be one of you. I know it sounds incredible. You've all been investigated so many times. - At least 50. - I know, and I'm sorry. And that's why I thought if any of you had noticed anything? Anything out of line. - If we had, we would've reported it, Mr. Dunson. - Well, it's somebody here, and everybody's a suspect until we find out who. - I'll take it. Yes? All right, bring her up. - There's a girl coming up who can positively identify the voice of one of you as being the voice she heard at the Casa Del Mar the other night. - Please, I'd like some water. - Get her some water, Gomez. Someone's slipping out the door. You people stay here. Close that door, Gomez. - Are you okay? - Sure, it's just my arm. - Now you stay here and don't budge. - Jeff! - I don't get it, Klaxon, you of all people after all these years. - Yes, I know. - And you're the head of this whole gang? - No, Ina wanted everybody to think I was, but I was just a stooge like the rest. - How did you ever get mixed up with her? - I picked her up boosting about three years ago. I fell for her. I've never been able to break away. - All right, take him out. Check that woman upstairs who fainted. - How's Lieutenant Palm? - He'll be all right. They're taking care of him. - Isn't it funny, Sheriff? How I can be right in the middle of something very important, and still be thinking about something else at the same time? Look what I picked up during that chase upstairs. - Don't take your last two days too seriously. - Just put this on the account that I'm opening here tomorrow.
