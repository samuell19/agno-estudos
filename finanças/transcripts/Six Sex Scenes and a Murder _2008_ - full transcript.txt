Who wanted Nick Hamilton dead? Like I said before, detective, I met Dean and Todd for a night cap. They left, and I went to bed. Dean Freedman and Todd Martin. I need shana Peterson and Kelly riggs. Well, my sister and I went out around... I need grace sharr. I'll help you in any way that I can, But last night I went home. Don't you want to know who killed your brother? You're not very good at your job, detective, Or maybe you don't care. I think you don't care. What I do want to know is which one of you did it. Was it you? Was it castillo? Safety is a funny thing.

Um, yeah, can I have agent Harry reece, please? Extension 116. No, I'm sorry. There's no one by that name here. Thank you. Uncle Harry, hi. What do you need, my dear? I need your help. I need to know how to handle a situation. I need to meet with you, okay? Okay. Love you. Bye. You are my problem. What is this? I bought you something. You bought me something?

I want you to hold on to that for me. Okay. You bought me a house? What's in the box? Charlie gave it to me. He said if I'm ever in trouble, that's my way out. Open it. I can't. I don't have the key. What's in the box? I'm serious. What's in the box? Mr. diamond's office, may I help you? Can you hold, Mr. Hamilton? Mr. diamond, you have a call on line two from Mr. Hamilton. Put it through please.

What's the matter with you? I do everything for you. Nick, how do you get into all this crap, really? What about marriage? What about kids? You know I only have to do this one last time, And then I'm out, really. It's all about timing. We can't move. Why do you rub it in my face? Just listen to me right now. You take so much for granted, And sometimes in life you don't get a second chance, So you come across all these roads, and, you know, If the road isn't right for you right now, You think it's gonna be there for you later, So you sit there thinking that everything's gonna work out, And sometimes they don't. Doors close, Nick. I'm pregnant. Oh... And I got that job in New York, And I think we should leave here. I mean, we could. We really could. We can't have a baby, regan. Not now. I mean, we can't bring a baby into this. You know, you have your whole life ahead of you. You need to get away from me. I don't want to hurt you. I know. I'm going to have an abortion on Thursday, And then I'm leaving. I'm moving to New York. I can't do this anymore. I'm done. You're reckless, and I can't do this. I can't keep waiting for you. I want you to have this. I do. I'm sorry. Todd's old man made him a partner at the firm. He's actually running that place now. Congratulations, that's great. Oh, my God! Oh, come, and just like that.

Just, just return it with the money. I want you around, huh? I got a lot of plans for you. I'm calling my own shots now.

I'm not in charge of this one, pretty lady. Well, get control. Been waiting to get my hands on this for years. Perfect. Everybody down! Don't do anything stupid! Everybody on your feet! Get up! Well done. You pulled it off. You know, you're making a lot of enemies in this town, Nick. Do you have any idea how big this hit is? I'm not trying to make any friends here. If everybody keeps their mouths shut, We won't have any enemies. And you... Thank you, Gracie. Don't thank me, just pay me. Oh! I can not wait to not work in this shithole anymore. Thanks a lot, Gracie. No offense, Tony. Hey, good job. Did we get it all? Money's all there. Where's the box? All right, guys. Trust me, this shit gets out, we are all going down. Damn. They must have had other business going on. Nick, we're gonna have to move quick on this. Count that later. We got to get you out of here. Get a car. Do the trade tonight. Thank you, Tony. You're a good man. Take care of mom and Jess. Yeah, I will. Well, it's been a pleasure doing business with you, Gentlemen, but I'm in need of some sleep. Hey. Leave the red dress. Take care, guys. Thanks, Nick. Put that away, Robert, and get out of here, And I got one last thing I got to take care of, And I don't have much time, so... All right. It's your night. Until next time. All right. Nicholas, Where you going in such a hurry? You play the game, and you play by their rules, Or they'll kill you. Now, look, I know I owe you, son. You got me out of jail when I needed you, And you were stuck here because of it. You lost her because of this. They're not fooling around. They know you have it, and they're going to kill you. Just return it with the money. They may be able to help you. Just get it back to them. You know, you got a lot of soul, son. Don't let them take it. You know, you mean a lot to me. I want you around. I got a lot of plans for you. Then tell them to kill me. I don't give a fuck anymore. I never asked you for anything, Charlie. I call my own shots now. I'm done. You ain't gonna be playing the game anymore. Hey, sweetheart, how you doing? Great, Nick. It's been a long night. How about you? You look beat. Who's that guy you were sitting with? Yeah, okay. All right. Never mind your pretty little head with all that. Let's go outside. Kiss me. We're being watched. Hey, don't touch it. Just kiss me. What's going on? Ah! Someone's been shot! No one's talking. Nick Hamilton is a closed file. That's the breaks. The feds are still wanting to make a deal though. No questions asked. Tell them all they can go. Regan, I need you to sign some papers, And take his belongings if you want them. Yeah, I'd like that. Thank you. Here, I'll call you guys later. Thank you for doing this, Uncle Harry. I don't know what I would've done without you. Sure was good seeing you. I don't get out enough anymore. You've really done good for yourself. Your dad would be proud of you. I love you, Uncle Harry. I love you too. You know I'd do anything for you. Thanks, Nick. Al, it's me, Harry. I got everything on tape. I never thought Nick Hamilton would have the balls To wear a wire, but he was a natural. It cost him his life, But he gave us castillo gift-wrapped. Now go ahead and arrest castillo. They got him cold. What's in the bag? Tell the feds I've got the box. They'll understand. Yeah, I'll be in later. Probably much later. Hey, mister, want to play cards? Bella, let the man sleep. Sure, I'd love to play cards. What is your name? Bella. Bella? That is a beautiful name. Who goes first? You. Somebody is a shark here.
