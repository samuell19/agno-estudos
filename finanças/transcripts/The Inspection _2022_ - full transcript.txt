- So annoying. - That's what I'm talking about. Oh, my gosh. We missed you so much. Love you all. Are you in trouble? All these came for you, and one of 'em has a notice to appear. So, what's that all about? I don't know. Smells good in there. Why are you here? Ma, I need my birth certificate. Why? I wanna be a Marine. If you hear me, gimme an amen. Amen! Hallelujah! Glory to God! Hmm, no. Wait, hold on. Really, Ma? Sit your ass down, right here. Marines. Sure. Okay. Hmm. No, no, no. You have no idea how hard these past five years have been. Ma. You always said I would hit a wall. Hey. Something has to change. What about your lifestyle? I need you to help me. Please. I made peace with losing you. Never mind. This little... piece of paper. It's all I have left of... the dream I held for you. If you don't come back the son I gave birth to, consider this certificate void. ...two years since President Bush declared victory in the war in Iraq, the Al-Qaeda insurgency rages on. At least 30 people have died following an insurgent suicide bomb attack at a restaurant in Baghdad. US military leaders struggle to maintain control -and are requesting... -Hmm. I wanted to give you this. It still works. You see this shit? And more than 15 men wounded or injured in this attack, including several American servicemen who were on patrol there. Ellis. From one old queen to a young one. You don't have to do this. What am I supposed to do? You're... young. And beautiful. You're so, so smart. You could be anything you wanna be. Now, you and I both know that's not true. I hope to never see you in here again, kid. And you better not keep in touch. What made you sign up for the war, then? They went and told a nigger if I signed up they'd give a motherfucker 30 racks. They gave you a signing bonus? Ain't gettin' rich cuttin' a nigger around my way, but they will killing a couple niggers for old Uncle Sam. Hey, say, man. You gonna eat that? Oh, yeah. Oh, man, what'd you get? It's almost like they know a nigger. Got my oatmeal cream puff, boy. You hungry? You're not? Let's move! Come on! What are you looking at? - Get off the bus! - Move! If your shirt's untucked, you will tuck it in. - Say, "Aye, sir!" - Move! Let's go! Sir, yes, sir. Let's go! These are my boys. Drill Admiral Rosales and Brooks. Now... Look down at your feet on my footprints. This is called the position of attention. Heels stuck together at a 45 degree angle, knees slightly bent. My purpose over the next three months is to see that the strongest of you move forward to join the fight. Aye, sir! I will break you. I promise. I'll be the nightmare that keeps you from closing your eyes at night. You will think to yourself, "God, does this motherfucker hate me?" Yes! I hate recruits. But I love Marines. Aye, sir. - Recruit Ismail. - Here, sir! Recruit Franklin. Have you ever been convicted of a felony? Yes, sir! Have you been convicted of a felony? Are you a communist? Are you a homosexual? Have you recently smoked mari... Do not look at me, recruit! Have you ever been in a terrorist cell? -No, sir! -Well, what about 9/11? Nobody, and I mean nobody, asked you. On your fucking face, recruit! Castro! - Castro! - Here, sir! Ever been convicted of a felony? Are you a communist? Sixteen, fifteen, fourteen, thirteen, ho... I know you, don't I, boy? Yes, sir! You served with this recruit's father in Desert Storm. Do you have a problem with me, Label? I don't have a problem, sir. This recruit is very chillaxed, sir. I don't give a fuck who your father is, recruit. -You understand me? -Yes, sir! -Aye, aye, sir! -Aye, aye, sir! Ever been convicted of a felony? Are you a communist? Have you recently smoked marijuana, or ingested other narcotics? Are you in a terrorist cell? Are you now, or have you ever been a homosexual? No, sir! Say, "I love you, goodbye." Hang up the phone. You! I'm talking to you! - Hang up the phone. - You're next! Hang up the phone. Give me the phone. Gimme the... Gimme the phone! Gimme the phone! It's bullshit they make us guys choose between our girlfriends and our moms, right? Who you calling? My girl. Castro. Ellis French. Next. Turn around and go, get out of here! How was your boyfriend? Move! Move! You've reached Inez French. I'm not available to take your call right now. But if you leave me a message... You're done! Hey, baby. I made it to bootcamp... safe. I can't really talk right now, so... I'll write you soon. Next! Hang up the phone. Next! I'm... I'm just gonna try one more time. She probably stepped away... You only get one. - Come on. Move out! Move your ass! Come on, asshole! Make your call! Get your ass up here. Next! When you are finished, put your belongings in the little brown bag. Write your last form with black marker and line up! - Aye, sir! - Louder! Aye, sir! Don't you forget that last necklace. I want that chain! That's my chain! Don't forget about it, boy! This ain't your uncle's barber shop. This is recruit cuts. You will stand at attention. That means feet at a 45. Feet at a 45. And your face, and eyes straight front. Couple of best fucking friends. A regular Zack Morris and A.C. Slater. Is that what we fucking got here? Is my name fucking Principal Belding? Is that my fucking name? -No, sir! -What's so funny, recruit? You think I'm funny? Is this a fucking clown show to you? Push ups. Say "Aye, sir!" - Yes, sir! - Go, go, go, go! On your fucking face! Let's go! Ten! One, two, three! One... All the way up! One, two, three! ♪ Mama, why can't you see? ♪ Mama, why can't you see? ♪ What this Corps Has done for me? ♪ What this Corps Has done for me? ♪ Count off! -One! -Two! - Three! - Four. - Five! - Six! - Seven! - Eight! - Nine! - Ten! -Eleven. -Twelve! -Thirteen! -Fourteen! -Fifteen! -Sixteen! -Seventeen! -Eighteen! Nineteen! Lights out! Take interval, to the left! Even numbers to the right! Move! French, you're not gonna fuck up my goddamn formation. Third squad, hold steady. You're the base of this movement. Third squad, hold tight. That means you, goddamn it! Aye, sir! Are you looking to disappoint my Senior Drill Instructor? On your face, recruit! Everyone! Now! Caterpillar. Move, move! Push up! I can't hear you, you little slithering snakes that sound like sissies. Come on, French. Push up! - You have scoliosis? - No, sir. What's wrong with your back? Nothing, sir! Push up! Battalion PFT is in 15 minutes. Here you go. Thanks. Hey. We got this. Oh, I put in everything I got. It's driving me crazy, man. Come on, you got it. 92, 93, 94, 95. Let's go, Harvey. Ninety-nine, hundred! Almost there, recruit! Almost there! Yes, yes. No worries, man. I got you on those pull-up bars. Ready, recruit? On up, French. Come on, man. All right. Go. Go! All right. Harvey trying to make his grandpappy proud. Harvey, you gonna let French steal squad leader from you? No, sir! - Get up there. - 16,17... eighteen, nineteen, twenty! You're done, recruit. Perfect score. Unless French here decides he wants to try to tie your ass. Come on, dawg. Oh! To be a good Marine, means to know thyself and seek self-improvement. French. You pushed yourself past your limits today. Feel proud, recruit. Harvey. You're our squad leader. Good riddance. Wash your right arm right now. Aye, sir! Wash your left arm right now! Aye, sir! You eyeballing me, French? Wash your right butt cheek. And your left butt cheek. Slower. Here. Let me. You fucking kidding me, French? This nigga got a hard on. Shit. Get out of here, French. French? You're gonna be the last one to leave the head. And that's a direct order. Senior Drill Instructor, I respectfully request a moment. We can't just leave him here. Request denied. Carry on, gentlemen. Hold him. Ahh! Fuck! Look, French. We just don't feel comfortable with you around us anymore. French, just move already. Uh, it'd just be... It'd be easier for everyone, all right? Go ahead, nigga. Figure it out, French. The longer you take, the less time we have to eat. AT&T! Reach out and touch someone! Recruits, reel it up! Back the fuck up, before I back you up, boy. French, stand still. Go on, get the fuck off, I say. Did anyone tell you to get out of line, recruit? And did anyone tell you to talk, recruit? Jesus Christ! You must wanna get smoked. Let's go, green, let's go! Chow's over. Nobody eats! Everybody file out! We're going to the pit. Let's go! Move! Move! - Say, "Aye, sir!" - Aye, sir! Move! Move! This generation... You can't stand still to save your life, can you? He asked you a question, recruit! Sir! This recruit can't stand still when his fellow recruits are pushing him around, sir. Halt. Squat. -Squat! Say, "Aye, sir!" -Aye, sir! Squat there and feed the sand fleas. Forward march. Platoon, halt. Feel it, French. Feel it, feel it. Don't you shake. Did I tell you to shake? Eat it, French. What, sir? Did you just ask him a question? - Back in formation, French. - Aye, sir! This ain't a lounge show! Move, French, go! Faster! Faster! Forward march! Left, right, left. Double time march! Faster! Aye, sir! I notice you don't have much to say. You can talk, can't you? Sir, this recruit hates public speaking, sir. Hand me your weapon, recruit. Aye, sir. All clear, sir. I don't like your voice. Aye, sir! Received, sir! Lights! Lights! Lights! Aye, sir! Push! Keep those weapons two inches above the deck. Two inches! Aye, sir! Two inches above the deck. Aye, sir! Pain is not an excuse for lack of discipline. In war, there is no time to be hurting. - Aye, sir! - Pain... Is weakness leaving the body. Like that. Inspection, arms. Three... Four... Then push up. Five... ...six, seven. -Well done. -Aye, sir. - Go from the top. - Thank you, sir. One, tick-tick two, tick-tick three, tick-tick four, tick-tick five, tick-tick six... Wipe that smile off your face. Warrior face. If you're lucky enough to see combat, why is this weapon your best friend, recruit? Because it's the thing that protects the marine to my left and to my right, sir. Inspection, arms. One, tick-tick two, tick-tick three, tick-tick four, tick-tick five, tick-tick six, tick-tick seven. Thank you, sir. Zip it, French. Light! Lights! Lights! Aye, sir! This is the final stage of swim qualification. You are to save a drowning man. A drowning man is the most dangerous. He will fight you, even as you try to save his life. French. You better open your fucking eyes, or I'm gonna smoke your ass. Okay. Back up, back up. Come on. What did you think was going to happen? Stop whispering, French! Speak like you got a goddamn dick. Who do I report this to? Sir? Just who the fuck you think you're talking to, recruit? Look. You can go and report everyone for... what you think happened here today. But the only person you're gonna hurt... is yourself. Gimme your keys. Come on. Come on. We're leaving. Why the fuck aren't you doing your pushups? You don't have to say anything. You wanna report it, I got your back. You've worked so hard. You've come this close. Next few weeks are gonna breeze on by. I promise. Few weeks? In the next few... In a few weeks, I'll probably be dead. Boot camp is supposed to break you down. I'm here to build you up. It's the question... every Marine asks themselves. "Am I good enough to be here?" I think you've proven that you are. The real question is... why do you wanna be here? I wanna be a Marine. That's not good enough, French. Why did you work this hard if you're just going to quit? I've been raising myself since I was 16. Twenty-five now. My mom... she won't even talk to me. Most of my friends are dead, or in jail. The streets was gonna kill me no matter what, so... if I die in this uniform... I'm a hero. Somebody. Not just another... homeless faggot. What would you guys eat right now, if you could have anything to eat? Shit, come on, nigga. All of it. Aw, man, I'd probably get me one of them, uh... One of the Big Mac heart attacks from McD's. Okay. A bag of them fries from Wendy's. The little cherry slushies from, uh... 7-Eleven. - 7-Eleven. 7-Eleven. 7-Eleven, fuck, yeah. That's trash. Yo, why would you leave McDonald's for fries? That is true. McDonald's does have the best fries. Nah, Burger King has the best fries. Boy, you gonna crack us all. This nigga says Burger King. Yo, I don't... I don't understand. Are we... Are we gonna pretend like Laws isn't a fucking psycho? I don't understand how we can let him get away with this. I don't know how you guys don't see that. - I don't get it. - Look. Unless you have somewhere better to be, just shut the fuck up. I got a kid on the way. So the sooner we wrap this shit up, the sooner I can take care of my people. - Shit. - I'm with Boles. Wendy's fries are better than McDonald's. - I knew I liked that nigga. - Yeah. That's what I'm talkin' about, boy. Black power! Yeah? Shut your cockhole screws, you mothers of American tit-suckers! Mail call! In line! Now! Hey, birth defect Kyle. Eat that shit, Kyle. - Hey, birth defect Rocky. - Oh, shit. Oh, I love my brother. - Yo, what'd you get? - Got some titties. Oh, shit, I want the one with the ass. Hold on, nigga, I heard "titties". Here you go. This is you. I need me one of them Asian ones with the little tight pussies. There's no ass? You didn't get any ass? There you go. There she is. Aw, they got the bitches suckin' on each other's titties and shit. These are wild. Anything for me? One something for you. One something special. Let me see. Oh. That's right. You got duty, French. Get your cover, and report. Aye, sir. Ahh! The fuck! Fuck. ♪ Where I come from ♪ It's cornbread and chicken ♪ Where I come from A lot of front porch sittin' ♪ Where I come from Tryna make a livin' ♪ And workin' hard to get to Heaven ♪ Where I come from ♪ -Hey. All right. -Hey. I did not know you work out, boy. Yee-haw. Man. For a second, I thought French actually grew a pair, and was gonna turn you in. Yo... what did you say to him? Because I'm with Brooks. I half expected to be spending the night in the brig. You're not upset, are you? You and French are just bosom buddies now, huh? I took an oath to make the weak strong. So did you. Make them strong? My job is to make them invincible. Indestructible. There was no war on terror when we were coming up. We went over to Desert Storm. Thought we were hot shit. Winning the war in, what? Two weeks? Oorah! Ten years later, here we are. Nothing to show for it. Except 3,000 dead Americans, and the largest breach in national security in the history of the United States. Our job is not to make Marines. It's to make monsters. You really think we can turn that faggot into a monster? You know, when I first got this assignment, I looked up to you. You'd seen more combat than anyone I knew. I thought you were a real hero. Now I know you're just a bully. I fucking hate bullies. You watch your fucking mouth, Rosales. I have picked up my buddy's guts on foreign soil so that no one else has to. I got my four confirmed kills. If French earns the right to be a Marine on my watch, he's gonna be one bad motherfucker. Just like me. ♪ A left, right, left ♪ A left, right, left ♪ A left, right, left ♪ A left, right, left Tell your fellow recruits the fundamentals of a good shot. Aye, sir. All right, recruits. What we want to do, is get ourselves down into a good and comfortable prone firing position. In the crevice of your shoulder, eye down the sight. It's all about breathing. My grandfather told me that we got to name our rifle after our first loves. Mine's named Mary Agnes. But just because you give your weapon a name, doesn't mean that you'll pull the trigger when the enemy's downrange. Get your ass up. Get your ass up and put the gun down. Get up! Set up as target. Your enemy is going to look a lot like this. Take it in. And do not let this uniform fool you. This recruit refuses to train, sir. Excuse you? -This recruit refuses to train, sir. -Excuse you? - This recruit refuses to train, sir. Excuse you? This recruit refuses to train, sir. - Insubordination will not be tolerated. Aye, sir. You join the Mothers of America, Label? Is that it? A Marine is built to obey commands. Recruit Ismail is part of our platoon, sir. You taught us to never aim our weapons at something we do not intend to shoot. I will not pretend to shoot him. All right. This recruit... Get your ass up, and get back over here. Now! Faster! - Say, "Aye, sir!" - Aye, sir! Get your foot up. Get back in fucking position, Label. Yes, sir. Fire! Now, open your Bibles to Hebrews, Chapter 13. The Kingdom of God, is just like your life here. There is a chain of command, just like here. There is a code of justice... of his creation. We must be thankful for those that help us avoid moral incapacity. In the same way that we are thankful to our drill instructors, who teach us how to live in honor, courage, and commitment. Let us pray. Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Ismail? Leave me alone, French. -Ismail... -Leave me alone, French! Oh, no, no, no. Come on, come on. No, no, no, no, no, no. Come on. Right here, right here. Breathe, breathe... Come on. What's wrong? It's just... I was just thinking... No matter what I do, it doesn't even make a difference. Whenever Laws looks at me, he just sees another one of the guys who tortured his friends. I just want it to stop. Okay. Come here. It's all right. Does this make me gay? If you have to ask... I just want to go home. If we leave, they win. Question. This recruit requests knowledge. -This recruit requests knowledge. -Sir. This recruit requests knowledge, sir. What? What happens if you're not Christian? Like, do I even have to be here? Because these recruits are not Christian. Sir. The order states that troops are either involved in spiritual betterment, or troop readiness. So, does that mean these recruits can leave? You're either worshipping, or you go back to the squad bay. I thought you were sick of moving. There... There is no one else! I... I love you. I know. That's... that's a lie. I'll come see you after every single training cycle. Stop yelling. Why does everything have to be about fucking sex with you? Fine. You know what? Come here. Come here, and be fucking miserable. I don't give a shit! Just stop being such a fucking bitch! Hello? Hello? Sir? You okay, sir? It's okay. It's gonna be okay. All right, you shitbirds, don't say I never did anything for you. Most movies made about Marines are just bullshit. Aye, sir! Jarheads... this is what it was like for your senior drill instructor during Desert Storm. So... Sit back and enjoy your milk and motherfucking cookies. Thank you, sir. Yeah! You know what? Boy don't got no kind of stroke in this movie, man. I'll tell you, as soon as I get home, I'ma tear that thing up, man. Recruit Boles, if you don't stop acting a fool and pay attention, this movie could save your life. -Aye, sir. -Besides, anybody who talks about pussy half as much as you, probably a virgin anyhow. This is weapons qualification day. Half of you will shoot on the fire range, the other half will pull targets in the pit. If you do not pass, you will be processed out. -Yes, sir. -Move! You're my guy, eh, Charlie? Yes, sir. Make ready! Aye, sir! -Tuck your feet in. -Aye, sir. Butt of the rifle against your shoulder. Sight in. Breathe real easy. Nice and slow. -Remember, smooth is fast. -Aye, sir. You may fire when your targets appear. Target! - Cease fire! Cease fire! - Abort! Show clear. He hit, Harvey. I can see the mark. That's funny. I didn't see, or hear anything. How about you, Castro? Did you see, or hear anything? If he hits the target, he gets the point. Why the fuck do you care so much, Ismail? French... French, you're shooting target seven, right? Look, I was pulling eight all morning, and you've been shooting mostly in black, okay? Harvey's fucking you on purpose. Too bad, French. Maybe you should try the Navy instead. The Marines are the men's department of the Navy. Castro, mind your business. Aye, squad leader. That's bullshit, Harvey. I saw you cheating with my own eyes. -And you can shut the fuck up, too, Saddam. -Fuck you! Oh, Daddy and Grandpappy teach you how to shoot targets, too? -You're a fucking joke, Harvey. -You... Hey! Hey! Hey! -You back it up. Back it up! -Aargh! Come on, come on. There's no way I shot 300 rounds and only got 70 points. No way. That's right. He's been in the black all practice week. That's a serious charge, French. Harvey. Did you do it? -Is Osama bin... -Ismail. My name's Ismail. Is he lying? Castro saw, too. Sir, this recruit thinks that maybe he was tired. Maybe it wasn't on purpose, sir. They should kick your ass out for cheating. -And your faggot ass shouldn't even fucking be here. -Enough! Senior drill instructor Laws, this is your platoon, but you are on my firing range. According to the order, if there's tampering, he rates another opportunity. French, stay here and shoot again. Get in my lane, French. - Come on, man. -Move. -Let's go, French. Count off! - One. - Two. - Three. - Four. - Five. - Six. - Seven. - Eight. - Nine. - Ten. - Eleven. - Twelve. Lights! Lights, lights, lights! Good evening, gentlemen. Hey! What is it, French? Sir, this recruit needs some help. Get in here. Sir, this recruit has written home for the past few weeks now, and my mother hasn't responded. I'm worried something may have happened to her, sir. I'm begging you. May I please... please try her at work, sir? I can get smoked for this. You've reached East Jersey State Prison. This is Officer French. Ma. Ellis. They kicked you out, didn't they? No. I'm good. I'm doing real good. You get my letters? Boy, you know not to call me at my job with this damn nonsense. Ma, you coming to my graduation? What? I don't... I don't... I don't know. Please... come to my graduation. -I... I gotta go, okay? -Wait. I love you, Ma. Somehow, you have made it to the final test. Aye, sir! The Crucible is a time-honored tradition that thousands of Marines before you have gone through. And it is my last opportunity to rid my corps of your sad and mediocre generation. Aye, sir! Succeed, and you are assured to be a Marine! Fail, and you will be processed. What in the entire fuck, French! How did you manage to fag up something as simple as war paint? Sir! This recruit does not know how not to piss you off. Sir. Ready... step! Step together! Ready... face! Face together! - Let's pray. - Aye, sir. Lord... gives us life, so that we can kill the enemy. And God loves Marines, because Marines keep us free. Dear Father, who art in heaven, please give us clear vision, and a clean line of sight, that we might smite multiple tangos. We understand, for every life we take, a life is spared somewhere in the world. Heavenly Father, please keep our weapons clean, and our chambers free from debris of any kind, that we might better protect the Marine to our left and our right. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen. Amen! -On your feet! -Aye, sir. Carry on. Should've just stayed the fuck down, French! Go! Go! I'm right here, bitch. Fuck him up, French! Whoo. Read 'em and weep, boys. 3521 Motor T. That's funny, I was fixing up cars with Jiffy Lube before I signed up, and I'm gonna be, uh, fixing them up in my cammies. There it is. What you got, French? What MOS? Um, 4671, combat camera. What's that? Making movies and taking pictures for the Marine Corps. -Hollywood! -Oh, shit! -That's cool, man. -Maybe I wanna be an actor now. What about you, Boles? Uh... Infantry. Probably gonna have me killing a couple of your cousins. Killing is my specialty, so... I got combat correspondent. So I'ma be a journalist. I might need a photographer, French. - Okay. - Come on. Carson Daley looking motherfucker. Nothing. Yeah. All right. What about you, Ismail? I'm going to be a language interpreter. Language interpreter? What are you doing up? Get dressed and wait for me outside. Go! You really know how to fuck everything up, don't you? You're not the first of your kind here. And you won't be the last. If we got rid of every gay person in the military, there would be no military. You have to be willing to sacrifice anything to protect the man to your left, and to your right. I helped you, because it's my job to make Marines. Gay, straight, black, white, it don't matter to me. Disappear, French. Attention on deck! Good morning, sir. Platoon 2014 is ready for inspection. Congratulations, Gunny. Your recruits have passed inspection. Attention on deck! Parade... rest! Platoon... halt! Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. - Welcome to 2nd Battalion graduation day. You should be very proud... but I must warn you... that couch potato, baby fat, and bad attitude's gone. What stands in front of you today are modeled from... a perfect exhibition... ...of the United States Marines. Today isn't just about them. It's about you, too. The challenges that face them are the greatest this force has ever seen. Our enemies are tireless in their pursuit to destroy freedom. And so, must our corps be tireless in fighting for it. These young men and women will need your letters of support. They'll need a sympathetic ear. The American people are divided, and your unconditional love will be the fuel that will drive our Marines to defend each and every American citizen. Congratulations, 2nd Battalion, and welcome to the first day of the rest of your life. Oorah! Oorah! Oorah! Ooh Lord, he did it! You better go ahead, boy. Oh! Look at you. How do you feel? I'm hungry. I need a little nap. Are you hungry? My treat. Okay. - Oh, you... You look damn good, baby. -Thanks, Ma. I'll meet you... I'll meet you over there. -Okay. I don't know why I pay for stuff that I could... make better at home. Does this lobster look right to you? I think it's fake. This is imitation. Ma, there's no such thing as imitation lobster. Boy, if there's imitation crab, there can be imitation lobster. And this is it. Just enjoy it. It's on me. Come on. Should have got the salad. So... Where you off to next? Um... I got about a month until I have to report. So... I'm just gonna get a room somewhere. Maybe get something close to you... so I could see you. I got a lot of stories to tell you. Hmm. Yeah... You should just come on home. Not gonna charge half as much as a hotel. You know you could use some good home cooking. What do you say? I don't want to put you out. It's all good. Baby... it's no bother. Yeah... I better get you home. Ooh, all them young, pretty little things. All them girls. They're going to be lined up around the block trying to get a look at my Marine son. You're gonna have the pick of the litter. Ma... Boot camp didn't make me straight. You got a lot of shit to say. If I were to repeat what you just said, they'd beat the uniform off of you. Keep playing with me. You make me lose my damn appetite. You can't smoke in here. Ma. -You can't smoke in here. -Boy! You are out of your rabid ass mind! You can't hide in plain sight. I don't know why you even try. Is... everything okay, Private French? Gunnery Sergeant, please ignore her. This boy is gayer than two left shoes, and everybody can see it. Y'all had no business letting him in here. Ma'am, that's not for me to ask, or for him to say. And here, all he is to us is our Marine. Marines! Oorah! Oorah, baby. Oorah! -Oorah. -Oorah. -Oorah. -Oorah. Oorah! Oorah! Oorah! Oorah. Oorah. Oorah. Oorah. Oorah. Oorah. Oorah. Oorah. Oorah. Oorah. Oorah. Oorah. Oorah. Oorah. Oorah. Oorah. Oorah. Whoo. Oorah. Oorah. Oorah. Ma, stop! Really, Ma? I was 16. A 16-year-old girl with nobody. I could have left you at any doorstep. I was like, "No." "I'm gonna raise my child." What about me? Hmm? What about what I want? I am never... giving up on us. You belong to me, as much as I belong to you. Write me a letter. Whenever you're ready. Or don't. It's up to you. I will love you to the day that I die. But I can't love what you are. Hey, Devil Dog. Thank you for your service.
