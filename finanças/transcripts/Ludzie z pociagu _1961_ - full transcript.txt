PEOPLE FROM THE TRAIN screenplay music camera director So you don't like it here at this station? You call this is a station? Forest wherever you look, express trains don't stop here, two stopping trains per day, one can get crazy. Crazy... If you spend 30 years here you will get used to it. My dear... 30 years in such a dump. My dear... What is it? Białystok Fabryczny? PC-5604 departed at 7.58 A.M. Train dispatcher Kaliński, over. Mr. Kaliński, they threw flowers from the train! Look, how beautiful they are. And so fresh. Someone must have dropped them. - No one dropped them by accident. - How can you be so sure? - I know. - You do? Please, tell me. I won't tell anyone. It's not the first time. Apparently, Koriany is not such a God-forsaken place for all as it is for you. But who threw the flowers away? I wish I knew... What is it? Once you know, once you don't. - One might go mad. - Why they do it, I do know. It is connected with an event during the war. But who does it, I cannot tell exactly. - What event was it? - Oh, just a story... You weren't even born yet. Mr. Kaliński, do tell me everything or I will go mad. Just don't go mad. It happened in 1943, September or October... That day as usual I expected a stopping train... - Hello! - Hello! - We have a gift for you. - What is it? We'll have to leave the two last carriages, an axle broke in the penultimate one. And what about the passengers? Can you squeeze them in somehow? That's your problem. Call the controllers. What is going on? Why did the train stop? Wheel, the two last carriages must stay here, passengers out. Bloody hell! It looks like sabotage to me! No, no, it's not sabotage. Old carriage, kaputt. - Tell him... - Shut up. You will write a detailed report of the accident and the matter will be thoroughly checked, understood? And now get to work. People must be moved to other carriages. Get going! Get off! Everyone get off! What is it?! What is it?! Let me go! Why are you pushing? Piotr! Piotr! - What are you doing here? - Lift me up! Lift me up! Come on! Who did let you follow me and spy on me? You're behaving like a lout! Well, you can go wherever you please. It's your right! But I am not here on a picnic, do you understand? As of now we don't know each other! Idiot! They almost broke my legs, my dear, what happened there... - Józek, take the suitcase, let's go! - Attention, attention, there... Kaliński, get rid of these people. They can't stay here for the night! Mr. Bahnschutz... Next... train... tomorrow... morning. I don't give a damn! It's your business to get rid of them and do it quickly. We must stop... freight train... here... passengers away! Impossible! It would be against the regulations. Freight trains are for goods, not for people. Not necessarily. Freight train is out of the question, do you understand? Apart from that you can do whatever you want. Koriany, Kaliński. Carriage control post. DG-90050 left two passenger carriages, accident, axle broken. Send an auditor. Look for the fourth one... - So who do we look for? - I wish I knew... Here, here! Let's go. It's not easy to clean it up... - Hey, sir! - But why? - Get lost, right now! - ...I was the first here! I was here earlier! - Get lost, right now... - Heniek, come here! - Get lost! Heniek, shuffle. - Twenty each. Let's go, let's start with twenty each... Welcome, Mr. Kaliński. You ended up here as well... Just our luck. It will be somewhat more joyful at least. - Good afternoon. - What is it? What happened? What is it? Could you... Could you call... Call my mother at her office? What a moment you've chosen! I have more important matters to attend to. Dear sir, she has weak heart, she'll be worried sick. I beg of you. You should have stayed at home instead of travelling! There are no private calls from a company phone, is it clear? Good afternoon! So? Station Master, allegedly there is a freight train coming without a German crew. - Could we take it? - Allegedly... I'm just thinking about it. Station Master, we with my brother-in-law absolutely must get on the train. With some goods. I'd like to let all get on it but the Bahnschutz grumbles. He is freaking obstinate and messes with everything. Station Master, and if we can find him some employment? - I don't understand. - We have some moonshine... Who knows, if we could keep him busy for an hour, it would be enough. - Try, gentlemen. - Well, Station Master. It is somehow inappropriate for us. If the Station Master would be so kind as to lead him to us! I don't like such affairs! Well, I will try to lead him to you. Come on, let's go! No, it's impossible here! Go, go! I'll come to the waiting room. Well, we can take no for an answer. He's looking for something... He's looking for something. - What is it? - Water. For... my child. Ah, water... - He's gone. - Finally. - The fat one looks like... - Here, here! Can't you see it's crowded here? - This place is taken! - Get lost now... Move aside, can't you see he has suitcases! He is seated like some lord! We did a little business, you see, at least we tried but it didn't work out. - What is the number of that office? - Sir, - but how much is it going to cost? - Calls from company phone are free. What number? 31-28. Thank you. A man caught cold... Don't you know when we can go on? What does the station master say? There should be a freight train in an hour But we don't know if it's going to stop, a stopping train will be here tomorrow at noon only. Well, at least it's not in a week. My God, how this nation suffers. Well, I did sell and sold it well. - Well? - Yes, I sold it for a good price. I went there, bought some bacon, you know. Marylka! I bought it for less. The best is to pay in kind... I bought some honey and some milk. Well, honey, well, same price everywhere, just like butter. Some are expensive, some are cheap... But sometimes you can strike a good deal... One moment it is twenty, another it's forty. Do you expect him to drink from such a glass? Is he some count or what? - Give it to me... - And there is poultry! What is it?!? What did your granny teach you? For twenty. - I pass. - Just look at it. Twenty and forty. And you're not afraid any more that I had the... OK, so I'm not giving that forty. - Fight between yourselves. - Did you give that forty or not? Look, the sixth of January. If you allow me, my name is Kwaśniewski. Leave some mark... And the eggs? You know, recently there are no eggs on the market. They killed the hens and there are no eggs. Pestilence in the village. Eggs are expensive now. Very, very expensive Józek... Józek, when you dispatch the freight train... tell them to stop at my station. I have some people to pick up from the stopping train. No... nothing... it's just a bad day today. See you then. Has the postman come already? - I don't know. - Will he come today? Hamburg was bombed again the day before yesterday. Who knows what happened to my family... Kaliński... what would say to some vodka? Yes... it is good for my hand. It always hurts in such weather. Yes, vodka is good... ... get some some... My cousins came... here... drink a lot. Yes? And where are they? - Here you are, Mr. Bahnschutz. - Cousins? Mr. Station Master, what about that freight train? Oh, the station master. - Mr. Station Master! - When shall we go? - When does the train arrive? - When it comes, it comes! No panic, I said. When it comes, it comes. There are my cousins. I thought you meant girls. Where is mustard? Mustard! - Get lost! - Get lost, right now. Get lost, haven't I said it?! Get lost, right now! Two hundred for me then. - Two aces will be enough? - Not really. Your final hour has come. Aren't you at all happy that we are together? - Stop fooling around. - You're fooling around. The police pays no attention to lovers and drunks. I am anyway, so what? - Ania. - I take the challenge. Why did you come with me? Why do you mess with things that are none of your business? - How did you know about my trip? - What do you care? I have my contacts. Kmicic. Look at me with your blue left eye, come on. - Come on, sing! - For how much? Mr. Bahnschutz, please, have some. - I'm good. - Two for me. So what do you think of the sausage, Mr. Bahnschutz, good, isn't it? You see. What will you say? What have you got? - Heavenly wedding, kings and queens. - Lunatic! You have nothing but a three! Come to me, you'll like it here. Just a moment... Twenty. Anka, don't get on my nerves. Lives of several people depend on this trip. And that is why you can't talk to me? You'll see that these jokes will end up badly. I can smell something evil in the air. I can't smell anything. - Anka! Anka! - Anka! Anka! Enough of this moaning. You're behaving like an old woman. Mr. Station Master! Mr. Station Master! Excuse me. Don't you happen to know how things are for us? What things? People gossip that some freight train is to come but nobody knows if it is going to stop here. Are you in a hurry? Yes, very much so. We will do all we can to stop it. And how long will it take? We shall see soon. Józek... what about the freight train? Passengers are getting nervous. You're finishing unloading... OK... When you dispatch it, let me know. - You see, we're doing all we can. - Full house! - I pass! - Wacuś, what is it? Sit down! Who doesn't play, doesn't win. Young gentleman, will you join us for a while? We have lots of time. - Why do you think you're so important? - Are you really so important?! Maybe you will play, young master? So what will it be? Leave him, Gienek. Young master prefers more private games. - So what will it be? Will you play or not? - No, I will not. Why does your voice tremble so much, master? I'll hit you in the head, you'll get over it in a second! Leave the boy alone. Right now! Now, you see... That's how it is, they have a fight... The guy in a beret is a wiseguy... - Thank you. - Give the cards. We have an easy prey, gentlemen. Play carefully or we'll frighten him away. Twenty each. I'm in. He will destroy us, turn us all into beggars. - What did he say? - Nothing. What do you mean "nothing"? You want to get me drunk, don't you? I know you, brothers. Kaliński, you have very fine cousins. No, no, they are OK. - He's going to sleep soon. - May he go to hell. Kaliński, come here. Body search. What have you got here? Ah, tobacco. OK. Have some more. Good vodka. Try the cucumbers. - Anything he says is a blast. - You took it to a wrong place. No one was saved, not a single person. It turned out that there were mines under the tracks. My God, one cannot know anything in this life. Not far from here, near Leśna, they blew up the tracks. I haven't got a clue how we're going to get to that train. - I just wish it would stop here. - You're a widow as I can see. So young and a widow. Your husband...? He was killed during the defence of Warsaw. It happens so in life. Listen, girl, I need a piece of string. Can you find some - and I will show you something, OK? - What? Don't talk so much, just give something to eat. Let him drink! Just be quiet because he doesn't have a ticket. Look for some, tell them you need it for skipping rope. Gentlemen, gentlemen, please, be quiet. - Forty zloty. - Forty and eighty. - Eighty... - Just a moment! Don't hurry so much. Go away! Go away! - Leave us, kid, - Right now! You must not touch this. Gentlemen, colleagues, one more drink. One more glass each. Come here. Mr. Musician, come here. We can't expect anything good. Play. "Die Wacht am Rhein". What is he playing? What melody is this? I don't understand. But I do understand: you're a partisan! Me? What are you talking about, Mr. Bahnschutz! Just see him! He drank our vodka and he's misbehaving! Friendship! Friendship? I will show you what friendship is! - Let's go, Mr. Bahnschutz! - Just a moment. First I want to know what melody it was. - I don't know. - Ah, is it so? And you don't know either? It means you're a partisan. You're all partisans! All! Bloody bunch! - What have you in there? - No bacon! No sausage! Let's go now! Come on! You're also a partisan! Partisans! Bloody bunch! You there! You're also a partisan! - Let's go! - Partisan! Hands up! Don't touch me! Hands off! Just you wait! Bandit! Just you wait! - Are you mad! - I will teach him! - Gentlemen, the money! - You fool! Leave, bloody fool! Is it yours or what?! Don't touch it?! It's OK, it's OK. Calm down, my baby. Maybe you want to go for a walk? This boy will go with you, OK? Sit down, sit down, sit down. The war goes on, Hitler watches over everything. Here you are. - He's a bandit! - No, Mr. Bahnschutz. He's a fool. - Look after this basket. - OK. How much do I owe you for the phone call? - Leave me alone! - No, I don't want to have any debts. I have already told you! Come here! So your boyfriend left you alone. You can' talk? I won't allow any such thing! Come here! I don't want it this way, here is 5 zloty! Stick it somewhere, you brat! What is your name? - Marylka. - Marylka? You're too dark to be a Marylka, you know? Maybe you're... Salcia? - What happened? - Nothing. You can't play hide and seek here. I do it in earnest, not for fun. Can you see me? No. And if they come from this direction? And now? You know, this lady is not really my aunt. And this mongrel is not really my dog. Why are you laughing? I took it from the village, they wanted to drown it. - Why are laughing? - Funny word, mongrel. How could you behave like this! I really don't know what to say! It's all because of you! Your presence sets me off. I was very quiet and now I tremble with fear. I fear for you, I don't want to put you at risk. And for this purpose you behave like a lunatic?! I couldn't let him pull my arm. I couldn't let him pull my arm. - You should get your nerves checked. - I don't know, maybe. Ever since I saw you I've had a bad premonition. Something is certain to happen. Nothing is going to happen. A freight train will arrive in half an hour, we'll get on. Together, obviously. You probably think I'm drunk... That you're stronger because I have a sick arm, don't you? You're very much mistaken. I will shoot you all. What do you need the phone for? You want to call partisans to help you. Just you wait. It's no time for calls, we're drinking now. Do you know how it happened? An incendiary bomb! When I was on a leave... Here is my child, my wife. Traitor... Hands up! I know what you're up to. You want to kill me! You've got it wrong. Stop! Don't move! I have here bandits, partisans! I need help... right now! Why don't you answer? Which post? What number? I am calling all stations! Alarm! Pass on the information immediately! Hello! Hello! Józek! Józek, is it you? Where is the freight train? Yes, I know, I could not take the call. It's coming! Thank God, maybe we can make it still. Oh, nothing. I will tell you later, bye. Mr. Kaliński! Mr. Kaliński! Mr. Kaliński, what happened? - Any problems? - It's worse, the Bahnschutz got drunk. He made a phone call. I just don't know what to do. Oh shit! We must warn the people, they should hide in the forest. Are you mad? The worst that can happen to them here is confiscation of bacon, but if they get caught in the forest... No panic. Anyway, the freight train should be here in fifteen minutes The German did not say where he was calling from, they will have to check it. - It will take a while. - Ah, he didn't say. So we're OK. Put somebody who speaks German on the phone. When they call, he can explain everything. - It'll be better this way. - You're right. Ah, take a closer look at the two guys with a double bass. - It doesn't look like a double bass to me. - Yes, sir! I'm coming! I'm coming! Mr. Station Master... I declare a state of emergency! Calling railway station No. 22, Koriany! Yes... everything... Hello! State of emergency! Calling railway station No. 22, Koriany! Why aren't you answering? Ladies and gentlemen, attention! Which of you speaks German well? - Who speaks German? - Who speaks German? Sir, when can we leave? Who can speak German well? - No one speaks German. - Who speaks German well? - Isn't there anyone from Poznań? - What happened to that train? - Mr. Station Master! - What happened, Mr. Station Master? Boys, wait, I'll go and see what it is. Stop screaming. All together but not this way, in order. Mr. Station Master, you can tell your compatriots the truth. We're like in a cage here, come on, tell us what is going on. - Are you building the train or what? - Mr. Station Master, maybe you have some problems with the Bahnschutz? I need to call an office. - Ah, so... - What office? - Where is the train? - I speak German. - Unfortunately, it has to be a man. - A man? - Has anything happened? - Nothing important. - Bloody hell, do tell us what happened? - Nothing happened. - Shut up, you idiot! - Can you take your in-law aside he's drunk and keeps getting in the way. How long can we wait here? Let's all get together, - and we can do something about it. - Shut up, you're drunk. But I'm asking you very kindly... Mr. Station Master, what is going on?! Tell us, what happened? When can we go on, sir? Where is the young man who had a fight with the Bahnschutz? I saw him when he went to the platform with that girl. Holy cow, what happened?! Mummy's boy! You haven't seen it when he fought the Bahnschutz? I haven't. Marylka! Marylka! Marylka! Marylka! Come out of there! Marylka! You're a terrible coward. I'm not a coward. I am afraid. You have no reason to fear when I am with you. You aren't older. - Who do you want to be when you grow up? - A doctor. - Will you give injections? - My mother has a weak heart, I must cure her. I will be a dancer. Look, I can dance. One, two, three, four... One, two, three, four... It's not a dance. It's just gymnastics. You need more space to dance. Leave this corner. No. My first aunt said that I mustn't leave, and that it was a dance. There was very little room there. A wardrobe here and a wardrobe there. Isn't it nice? One, two, three, four... I heard that you were going... So I followed you to the station. Oh, if I could get you there. That's exactly what I was afraid of. I was hiding from you, but I saw you all the time. Tell me what is it all about? Do I really need to explain? I just felt like taking a little trip on the train. Do you think I could have just stayed at home?! Piotr! I know everything. You can't... go on after that action. They should find you some other duty. Piotr! I'm dying with anxiety! So you came all this way to make a scene here! - Yes. I did! - You're complete lunatic. If they arrest me today, they will arrest you as well. God knows what for! Out of sheer foolishness! - Yes! Out of sheer foolishness! - Stop it! Piotr, let's talk like adults. It can't go on like this. Piotr... Do you love me? - I think I do. - I don't want to hear any "I think". Say: I love you the most of all. Why do you all want us to repeat such things over and over again? Because we know it's all a lie. I beg only one thing of you, and you refuse me this one thing. You're behaving as if you were 10 years old. Please... Give me a cigarette. You haven't got a clue how funny you look. You think it's funny. And I took up smoking because of you. When you leave, when you're not at home, I just don't know what to do. I smoke at night as well. You'll see, when the war is over, I'll be good for nothing. You see? This is what happened to me. It's not going to change. Piotr! - Do you speak German? - Not too well! But you spoke to that German. When you're fooling around, you're so wise. - And when you're really needed... - What is really needed? Franek, listen, man. It's important, lower the barrier. Germans are coming. What? They're already there? Józek, where is the freight train? The freight train! You were looking for someone who speaks German, didn't you? - I was out, what is it? - You came right on time. Yes. No... - Don't do it. - You, get lost! - One. - Two. - Three. - Shall I hit you? Watch out, loser! I give three. Waiting. - Waiting. - Twenty. - Twenty and forty for me. - I pass. - Forty and two hundred. - I won't give this much. Two hundred... wait, wait... what may he have... He took three cards... - So what do you say? - I'll wait. - So you give. - Are you waiting? Everybody is, the pool is blocked. - So give. - Penalty twenty zloty each. - Here is twenty. - And mine. I have to leave for a moment, look after Marylka. I don't have any. I don't have an opening bid. Have you? - Have you got an opening? - What? - Have you got an opening bid? - And what is an opening bid? - A pair of kings or a pair of aces. - Ah, I have some pairs. If you have a pair, show it and open... So I open for fifty. Fifty what? Thousand or groszy? It didn't go too well this time, you'll make up for it next time. - It's sheer luck. - Come on, let's start! Move aside, now. Get lost! - Sir, when can we go? - Just a moment. - Mr. Ignasiak. - Watch out. - Have you checked the double bass? - They won't even let me touch it, they are some weirdoes. Dear sir, Dear sir. So when is the train coming? We gave the vodka, didn't we? Come, tell us what is going on. Hold it. - You don't want to tell a Pole? - You talk too much. Stop stirring up trouble. It's all down to sheer luck. - There are those who help luck. - And there are natural born losers. Let go. - You're not playing! - How do you know? Maybe a natural born loser feels like playing? He may feel like it but he has no money. - You play only for the money? - No, I can even play for - a body but not yours. - Will you play for these? - What is it? Have you murdered someone? - Do you play or not? Last souvenirs of my late parents go to your bloody bank. - Three hundred. - Three... and five more. Waiting. How much? We shall see if these souvenirs can bring you luck. Who else should be warned? - I can't see anyone. - They passed through Drwalki. The freight train should be here first. - Mr. Station Master, when does our train arrive? - Just look around. - Your parents are praying for their son in heaven. - So now you play for wedding rings? - As you can see. Family jewellery, is it forbidden? It's not, not at all. - Do you love me a little? - Just a little. Piotr, do what I ask of you. - We were not supposed to talk about it. - But I can't stop thinking about it. So think but don't talk. What is it? Nothing, nothing. Piotr, have you got it on you? I'm not answering stupid questions. - Give it to me, please. - I'm not going to respond. I know, you don't have to say anything. Everybody rise! Hands up! - Hands up! - Yes, sir! Officer! Bahnschutz drunk too much... and called. But there are no partisans here. Two carriages are down... These are just passengers. The Bahnschutz drinks too much... - Where is he? - Here. Well? Where is he? I want to see the Bahnschutz, understood? Maybe it's better not to look for him? I beg of you, give it to me. Herr Sturmbannführer, we have found this. Who does this toy belong to? Gentlemen, too much dust, I pass. - I noticed here one Jewish girl. - Family souvenirs... Take them all out. Leave everything! Mr. Bahnschutz! Inspection! What are you talking about? What inspection? Germans have come! Move on because when they find... Leave me alone. I would like to get to know the owner of this gun. Herr Sturmbannführer would like to know the owner of the gun. I give you five minutes. Herr Sturmbannführer gives you five minutes. The owner should step forward. The owner should step forward! I give you five minutes. Herr Sturmbannführer gives you five minutes. After five minutes every fifth person will be shot. After five minutes every fifth person will be shot! - Boys, it's over. - Try, natural born loser. Herr Sturmbannführer, five minutes. One, two, three, four, five! I am a trader, not a partisan. Please, please! Not a bandit! Trader! - This child is with me. - Let's move on! Piotr. This is my gun, I brought it. What does the boy want? It's mine, I brought it. It's impossible. Herr Sturmbannführer, with them everything is possible. Where did you get it? Respond. Talk right now! It's my gun. Herr officer! It's him, the Bahnschutz! It's his gun! - My gun. - Is it true? Yes, Herr Sturmbannführer. So you say it's yours. And you lost it, did you? - Take him! - Yes, Herr Sturmbannführer! And everything is clear. Let's go! Or the train will depart! To the train! To the train! To the train! Why did you do it, boy? What came over you? I could do it. I'm not a member of any organisation. If they tortured me I wouldn't betray anyone. Please, don't call my mom! They have already killed two of my brothers, I had to swear, I will do nothing risky. It was probably his mother that threw the flowers today. Maybe... Maybe that woman... or one of the young ones. Or the girl. Or somebody else entirely. Who can know. Koriany railway station, station master Kaliński. PC-1103 left at 9:40. Over. - Koriany! Get off! - Koriany! Get off! Ready! Thank you, Mr. Kaliński! Depart! THE END
