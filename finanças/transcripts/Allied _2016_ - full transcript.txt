Not Bad. You were not so bad yourself Max Vatan. Marianne Beausejour. Heard a lot bout you around the circuit. I have heard a lot about you Keep going straight. I'll tell when to turn. You in Dieppe for a while? A husband would offer his wife a cigarette before lighting his own. Turn right here. Thank You. What went wrong in Paris? Your entire circuit was taken out. I never discuss non-relevant operational information with anyone. I'll try to stay relevant then. That would be appreciated. Do they trust you? Two months ago, I got promoted to the embassy liaison department. I deal with the German legation everyday. But do they trust you? How did it look? They seem to like you. And I like them. I keep the emotions real. That's why it works. Don't slow down. This is how you drive in Casablanca. We won't be in the apartment much. I have to go out there and sell you. We'll have to be careful. I've told everyone my husband is from Paris. And? And... your french is good... but your Parisian accent is terrible Oh.. So then you are in trouble. That was pure Quebec. with French Moroccans you might be okay, but.. You have to be careful in front of real Parisians until the party. Party's in 10 days. Is my invitation gonna be a problem? Now that you're here I am going to set up a meeting with Herr Hobar. And then its up to you. Can you stand 10 days in this tiny little place... Le Quebeqois? Its not so bad. Water is hot, sometimes. I'll take the couch. Actually you'll sleep on the roof. It's cooler... And in Casablanca,the roof is where the husbands go... after they've made love to their wives. The neighbours will find it curious if I don't come to visit you on your first night. I told madame Torgenot, and madame Petit all about you. They'll be very excited. They'll guess that the sex is already over. And it was great by the way. Then... You went to the roof. I missed you... ...because I've been sleeping alone for so many months. So I came up to tell you I love you. You're very thorough. That's why I am still alive. Now we should talk. And laugh. We're married. Why would we laugh? Kiss me. Now Talk. Tell me.. ...what you'll do after the war. I don't know what I'll do after the war Look! The lovely madam Petit in apartment 7. She's married to a German tank captain. And she's watching us. So we should talk... And laugh. Okay. After the war, I'm buying a ranch. With horses. A ranch? You mean like in the movies? Cowboys? Bang bang!? Yeah. Are you just saying this to say something or is it real? Umm its real. Its a... ...ranch on a prairie. outside a place called Medicine Hat. Now I know you're joking. You think you'll ever get there? Well.. I guess that's not the point of Medicine Hat, huh? No. Ok. That wasn't so hard was it? Now this is the part where I tell you I Love You... ...and leave you to count the stars. Or whatever it is men do on their rooftops. Je t´aime. Je t´aime aussi. Now kiss me again. Bon nuit. You can come in now. You are somewhat formal and reserved. But you like expensive clothes. And yours shoes are always polished. We told everyone you're quite a serious Catholic. At least you can smell like a Parisian! I'll leave you to choose. Before I left London, Guy Sangster asked me to say thank you. We flew Lizzies together. Remember Guy? You got him out of Dieppe in '41. Ok: what did he say about me? He said you were beautiful. And good. Being good at this kind of work is not very beautiful. You look okay. Let's go. What went wrong in Paris? V-Section left us hanging out to dry. How did you get away? I ran. And ran. Kept on running. Madame Petit. Lurking in the window. This Herr Hobar we're meeting tomorrow: What can you tell me about him? He is the ambassador's liaison. A high ranking party member from Cologne. He likes golf and gambling. He is our final hurdle. You have 2 seconds. Go. The guns will be taped under the champagne table. The ambassador arrives at precisely 8.30 If he's late? He's German. He'll be on time. How come you don't know 'Stens? I do know 'Stens. I didn't see you set the travel safety. You'll be okay to use a 'Sten on the night though? I would be okay if I had to use cutlery! Diversion attack will happen 5 minutes later, at 8.35 Then everything will be in God's hands Good. Hopefully he'll know how to work the safety. Its hot. What are you doin? Testing you... ...The way you tested me. I know youre armed with an weapon Mr. Vatan.. I'm just checking your safety catch is engaged. There! We had our first fight. Now we're okay again, yes? Marianne... We both know people who fucked each other. Then they fucked up & now they're fucking dead. Wow. That's a lot of fucks. Ask your goddamn partners. Actually Max... ...the mistakes people make in these situations isn't fucking. It's feeling. Oh, my husband's trying to cut down.. ..he says the war makes everyone smoke too much. I've only heard good things about him round town. Good things. Sit down please. Your husband doesn't speak English? Err, only a Little. He doesn't seem to want to come. There's a stupid Poker game in the Rue Valence Ya I see. (laughs) So your husband plays Poker? Oh: he's obsessed. As am I... As am I. And now we cut. High card wins. Wins what? If his card is higher than mine, he can go to his poker game. If its lower, he must come to the party. This is too absurd! Mining? Yes He works with Phosphate, right? That's right. One more thing. Boring. Procedure. For new names on the list... See you both Tomorrow. So it's in the cards. We get our chance to make history. Couldn't sleep. I won't let you down, Quebequois. I know. Let's get outta here. Let's go watch the sunrise. What are our odds? Surviving? 60/40... ...against. Both of us, I don't know. So tell me about Medicine Hat. Pretty green. Rolling hills. Clean water. Just a place I go when things get dark. You? You have a place? When the war is over... ..it won't matter where I am. We should be going. If we're dead tomorrow... ...no one would know. The guns? Gone. Merci, Le Quebequois. I'm from Ontario. Move! No one's following us. We are alive, Max! We are both alive. Come with me to London. Come with me to London & be my wife. George? Salute me, Frenchman! - Go to hell! - This is hell: it's an office. I heard an unspeakable rumor about you being in love. Oh! Gotta go, George. Buy me a drink later. Max! You appear to be walking on air! ..It's revolting! - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. - You said Frank wanted to see me? - Yes, straight away. Max please remember you are in the land of YES SIR, NO SIR - Don't throw anything or hit anyone. - Got it. He's ready to see you. Frank. They said you had news? Yes yes I have news, Wing Commander. Regarding Marianne Beausejour. It's been three fucking weeks. "SIR." "It's been three fucking weeks SIR". It's been three fucking weeks SIR. after the thorough vetting procedure carried out by... ...V-Section in Gibraltar Marianne Beausejour... has been approved for passage to England. That'll be all, Wing Commander. Max? You're a bloody fool. Yes Sir. Thank you Sir. Marriages made in the field never work. You're absolutely right, Sir. You're invited to the wedding by the way. - That's it. Careful, Mac! - Hold on. Here we go. Come on. That's it. Come on in Darlings. Don't ask me why that's true. What the hell have we here? You know. Here's a fun fact: Only thing in London not rationed... ...Champagne! Champagne and Sex. My God, Max. Your sister is obsessed. Yes, Isn't it wonderful? To my formerly perma-frosted Brother... Thawed at last! By love. That's rather poetic. Oh, for Goodness sake! Honestly: I'll miss the Blitz. I will. No one cares, who does what to whom. So we should be drinking the war! And freedom. - To war! - To freedom! Marianne, I would offer you my congratulations... But I've known Max a long time. I'll just wish you good luck. No no no! Now my brother's just an ordinary man. Flying a desk... ...in some boring office. A talented boy like Max won't be behind a desk with Frank for long. Our Spooky friends from V-section? They will come calling... Just when you least expect it. You entirely okay, Madam Vatan? Entirely. Breathe! Breathe! Breathe! Get up! Get Outside! (screams) Quickly! Quickly! I'll need that trolly. Help me. Get this up, now. Get her on it - away from the wall. Come on! Help me someone. That's it! Get me some light over here now! Very close. Good girl. Good girl. Pant for me. Girl? C´est moi! This is really me! As I am before God. It's a Girl. There! A celebration! - For What? - Your 1st weekend off in 57 days. I counted. - Are the eggs from the hens? - From our hens. Ah! So they were a good investment, hmm? Weren't they? Max... ...let's go to the heath and pick mushrooms? Tomorrow I want to serve Stroganoff at a party. What Party? Now darling, I've got lots of new friends who are dying to meet you. You'll like them. They're refugees. Intellectuals. Bohemians. Hampsted is full of interesting people. Poor Max. In Casablanca we pretended you hated parties et Voila! It's True. - What's the new nanny's name again? - Miss Sinclair. Sinclair. Hello, Miss. Sinclair. Max has 3 days off. Isn't that great? She just woke up. We won't be long. Just gonna pick some mushrooms. Oh.. take your time. It's always my Pleasure. I have to go and get Anna. Just once! You can ignore it. Just once. Hampstead 235. Sure. 15:00. I'll be there. When will you be back? You know I don't know. What the hell is it that's so important? Liberating your country. Then you must go. Morning, Margaret. - Good afternoon, sir. - Afternoon. George is in your office. But you said to meet you in the mess? Oh.. I lied. It isn't me you here to see. - Oh: do you?... - No. No. V-section want to speak to you. Why didn't they call me? V-Section don't ever say what they mean and they never mean what they say... ...and they never say anything on the phone. Look, I told you they'd come for you eventually didn't I, Max? Such a clever boy. Well, I suppose, I ought to congratulate you on your promotion. Since you seem to know so much, what is the position? Oh gosh. Way way above my security level, old man. I'm just the messenger-boy. - Wing commander. - Frank. Have a seat. We haven't been introduced. OK: Frank whatever the job is, I dont want it. I'm perfectly happy to stay with you. Max... I'm afraid this really isn't what you think it is. And... Well... There's no easy way to say what we're about to say. We believe your wife is a German spy. OK, wait. Wait. Seriously, Frank. Who is this? I'm a Rat-catcher. I also out rank you So you can call me "SIR". You have to listen to him MAX. He outranks both of us. Now over the past 7 days, V-section has intercepted coded messages... ..being sent from London to Berlin on the WT transceiver. We haven't traced the signal to an address yet. But it's coming... ..from the Highgate region of North London, and the Information... ..concerns the activity of SOE Circuits in France. In one transcript, the agent refers to his sourc as... .."Fraulein". So It's a woman. Ok, ok. Frank? Can we speak alone for a Moment? Wing Commander Vatan? Do you ever speak to your wife about your work? Okay. Uh.. Sir, before this thing gets out of hand... ...May I speak? Hmm? May I speak? - Yes. - Yes? My wife is Marianne Beausejour. Marianne Beausejour ran the most effective resistance circuit in Paris.. Until V-Section fucked it up for her in '41. We met in Casablanca. Where together we assassinated the German ambassador. She's the mother of my child. She gave birth to my child for Christ sake. This is a translated transcript of an interrogation of a German... ..Abhewr officer captured in Tobruk. Amongst many other things, he claims Marianne Beausejour... was arrested and executed in May 1941... when rest of her circuit was captured in Paris. Marianne Beausejour's identity... was then given to a German agent of similar build and colouring, she was flown to Casablanca,where no one knew the real Marianne. And it was subsequently discovered that the German ambassador... who you assassinated in Casablanca, was a dissident. Hitler wanted him killed. This is insane. All the information in the intercepted communications... had crossed your desk. Yes, everything crosses my fucking desk. Max, this is now an operational mission. If Marianne is indeed a German spy... - My wife is not a spy! - If she is... we need to keep her in place for 72 hours... so that we can identify her handler and clean out the rest of her circuit. No. Now we have got that out of the way, perhaps we could discuss... the operational details of the next 72 hours? So this is gonna be a standard Blue Dye procedure, Blue dye eing... I know what blue dye is. Tonight... You will receive a telephone call at exactly 23.07. Repeat the time Wing Commander. 23:07, Sir. You will take the call and you will write down a message somewhere your wife can read it. It will be false information, only you will have it. But it will appear to be of a high grade. So she will have to pass it on quickly. By midday on Monday... our agents will have decoded enemy traffic from the weekend. So if the false information... is among the batches sent from London, we shall know for sure. If you are right Max, the information won't appear on the transcripts and... all this will be forgotten. But if it is proven that your wife is a spy... Routine procedures in cases of intimate betrayal... will apply. You will execute her with your own hands... and if we discover that you are an accomplice in any way... You will be hanged for high treason Wing Commander Vatan. Do you understand? He needs to confirm that he understands... Routine procedures- He understand the procedure, damn it. Good. Max it is vital you do nothing differently. You are not to investigate. Or take matters into your own hands, do you understand? Sir, I uh... I apologize for... behaving unprofessionally just then. But I know, for a fact, you'll be proven wrong. Now Wing Commander, you will go home and carry on as if nothing's happened. You are dismissed. You were ages. You know how it is. Once you get in, you can't get out. Young pilot needed a pep-talk. And I got dragged into a briefing. Hey! What happened to my kiss? How's the Princess? Sleeping. Well the big news is I definitely have the weekend off. Until the Phone rings. Nope. Definitely free the whole weekend. So... The party is on? Yeah, the party's on. I'll need to get some drinks for tomorrow night. Mm-hmm. I'll pick some up in the morning. It's like they're watching us. Honey give me my arm. Hampstead 235. Wing Commander Vatan. - Honey Do you have a pen? - No. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I got it. I'll dispatch in the morning. Don't think I'm going to let you sleep, Mr. Vatan. I keep the emotions real. That's why it works. Come back to bed. It'll be okay. It'll be okay coz its not true. Honey? You're in uniform. Yeah I'm gonna pop by the base and pick up some whiskey. There's 50 cases of the good stuff stashed in diplomatic hanger. They won't miss a few. Why not just go to the shop? Nothing but the best for your intellectuals. I'll meet you at the pub, after & we'll pick up the beer. Of course. - Hi. - Max! What the hell brings you here? I just dropped by to invite you both to a party tonight. Why didn't you just phone? Max, you look like you did... the day that you burned the barn down. Marianne's cooking. Why don't you come by? Oh actually, Max? Tonight might not be possible. Max, Max I heard that you were in V-Section. If they're offering you some kind of suicide mission, you can say no to them. You know that. You hardly have anything on. What's happened Max? They are running a Blue dye on Marianne. Oh my GOD. But it isn't true. And I will prove it. I'd like you there tonight. Excuse me. Where can I find Group captain Guy Sangster? He's in the chapel, sir. Hello, Guy. Wing Commander Vatan. What do you want from me, Max? I'm finished. You people just threw me away. I need your help. - I have a question. - Yeah? Tough. I'm trusting you to tell no one about- Fuck You! I've been left here to fucking rot, Max! You told me you were smuggled out of France by Marianne Beausejour. Dieppe. 1941. Is this her? Why are you asking me about your wife? Guy, please, is this her? Ah, they didn't tell you. Max. My right eye has been shot out... and my left retina is detached. All I can see is... A white... shape.. Fuck. Well you know Max If you had not sent me into a... strip. Covered in fucking German Triple-A! My own son screamed when he saw me. I'm sorry Guy. Max? Delamare. Delamare is still operational in Dieppe. Hampstead 235. Hi honey. I'm at the strip. They're asking people to give blood after the raid, so I'm gonna be another hour. So, meet you at the pub after? Yes, I'll ask Mrs. Sinclair to look after Anna. - Ok, I love you. I'll see you there. - Love you. Squad. Attention. Put two cases of scotch from the officers crate in my car. Keep a bottle for yourself. - Whose flying Dieppe tonight? - Hunter, Sir. - Where can I find Him? - Try the shithouse, sir. At ease. Sorry, sir. Something I've eaten. These will settle your stomach. I'm going to save the amphetamines until takeoff. Then the Barbituates when I get back. If I get back. There's an operative in Dieppe. His name is Paul Delamare. Do you know him? No. This is my first time. First time to Dieppe? First time behind enemy lines ever, Sir. Paul Delamare runs the landing sites You can't miss him. He only has one arm. He usally have a few, but he's ok. I want you to give him this. Give it only to him. Only to the man with one arm. Tell him you need an answer. A simple oui or no. Yes Sir. Wait for my call in the telegraph office. I'll call you at midnight. This is classified. - No one must know, you understand? - Yes, Sir. It's very important. You can count on me, Sir. The fields in Dieppe are lined by Poplar trees. They are invisible if there's no moon, so... - climb quickly. - I know. I've been Briefed. Good. Who are you thinking bout? My mother. Don't... Think about your Father. He's proud of you. Yes, Sir. - I'm Sorry. Go ahead. - Thank You. Hey Billy. Two Brandies. Sorry. I've ordered three crates of bitter. Hazel? Filty pipe smoke. Thank You. Did you get the whiskey? I did. Churchill's own. A husband would offer his wife a cigarette before lighting his own. You did give blood! Good. I though perhaps you were with your mistress. It would explain why you were different with me last night. Different? In bed. It felt different. Good. 'Scuse me? Me and my mates would really like to see you two ladies kiss each other! Max! This.. splendid. Marianne! Wonderful party. Brilliant! Getting enough to drink? Very funny old man. Hey! Excuse me? We have a garden for that Take it outside. Please. Okay. You two. Outside, Outside. My people are behaving so badly. I thought they would eat something, Not just drink and have sex. Half of them I don't even know. I think word's spread on Homestead. C'est londres. C'est la guerre. Would you go check no one is actually fucking in Anna's room? Sure. Max! Max, Max! Sorry. Listen. I have been briefed that you're operational but... I haven't been told why you're operational. Now I thought as a friend I would just... give you a word of warning. If the job V-Section are offering you is the one everyone's talking about... Max: if they want you to run the resistance in France on D-day... You should know they wouldn't just call you in for a job interview, they will test you somehow. Test? How? Way way above my security clearance, Old Man. But just.. If I were you? Tell em to stick their Job. Careful, Margaret. Max. I was able to make it after all. Frank! I didn't expect you. Please, introduce a little sobriety to the affair. I wasn't planning on doing anything of the sort. Large Whiskey and soda, if you please. Would you get it honey? Frank has his work face on. You keep chickens don't you? Frank, you know too much. Show me your chickens, Max. You willfully and blatantly disobeyed orders. First you visit Guy Sangster, and burst half his bloody stitches- Frank, if it was your wife, would you trust V-Section? Adam Hunter's Lysander was shot to pieces three hours ago. on the ground.with him in it! He's dead! Because he stayed to long waiting for an answer to an question from a drunk! Frank, tell me... - Is this a game? - A game? Game. A test. I was just saying to Max: He's taken to office life like a... duck to water. I wouldn't know. I hardly see him. Come on, Honey. Let's dance. Frank brought you bad news? Another boy dead. Something more than that, I think. I asked Bridget there was something wrong with you. She said you were fine. But she's not trained to lie like you and me. We've had a setback. I can't talk about it. I think something's burning in the oven. It could be the Stroganoff. Stand down, Flight Lieutenant. - Margaret? - Sir. - Is the Dieppe job still on tomorrow? - Believe it is, Sir. - Forecast? - Clear skies sir. Hey. The man with the pipe. Who is he? Oh his name is Lombard. He has a jewelery shop on the high street. He was trying to sell me a diamond brooch. But I told him we're broke. Hey! Where are you going? - Max! - Marianne... - I really need to speak to you. - Geoffrey, you're too drunk. hey. Ah! The wife changed her mind. You mean about the earnings? No no no! I was trying to sell her a Brooch. I do have some beautiful earrings. I can offer you a very good price. Max. Its okay Mr. Lombard. We really are broke. Good night. Good night. I have to get Anna. I didn't hear a siren. Where were the sirens? Now they sound. They're like bloody ARP: always 2 steps behind. (Anxious crowd) They're targeting the East End again. We should be alright here. Max, no more. Please? By Monday morning, well... we'll know for sure. Try and get some rest. Frank? It's not a game. Even if it is... V-Section wouldn't tell you. Would they? They wouldn't tell you Frank. Look! We got one! Yes!... He's coming right towards us! Everyone take cover! I'll take her! Max! - Will you get rid of everyone? - Yeah. Max? Tomorrow we'll have a whole day with Anna. Let's forget the war. Let's make the best day ever. Yeah. I'd like that. Who'll Jump First? I've lit a fire. Come sit with us. This one? Flight Lieutenant! I have good news. You have the night off. Yes sir. Look. Look closely. Is the women in this photograph Marianne Beausejour? Who? Marianne Beausejour!

Wonderful watercolors That's right. Give me the bottle. And she plays the piano like a goddess. Piano? I remember Marianne. I remember when I met her. It was in a cafe, in Dordogne. The place was full of German soldiers. There was a piano. She went to it... and played "La Marseillaise"... in front of all those Germans! Oye, Pierre! Lucky Strike? Marianne... I need you to come with me Drop off Anna and come with me now, please What the hell are you doing? Marianne... I want you to play the piano for me. You want what? Why on earth would you want me to play the piano? I want you to play the piano because I love you. What are you talking about? You haven't slept. Let's go home. I want you to play "La Marseillaise". Now you've asked me some strange things. Play. Marianne Beausejour... played "La Marseillaise. In a cafe full of Germans in '41. I want you to play it for me. I know the story.

I am sorry. I need to know... Is this real? Do you love me? I love you. I love you. I've loved you since Casablanca. OK, listen to me. This is how it'll be. There is a Medicine Hat in... Switzerland or Peru or wherever the hell. We won't make it. If we stay one more hour, V-Section's gonna order me to kill you. And when I refuse, they're gonna shoot us both. You understand? We go now. We have to get Anna. Where is Marianne? You use my child as collateral? You've done far worse, Wing commander Vatan. Who else is watching us? Icn bin einen agent des Reiches. I would only give you my na- (baby cries) Come here sweetheart. Very good, Sir. You are free to pass. Wait here. It's over, Max! The Blue Dye came back positive..

Wing commander Vatan executed... the enemy agent with his own hand. That is how you'll report it. That is an order. My dearest, darling Anna. I'm writing this on a Sunday night in London. If you're reading this... then you barely knew me. And may have no memory of who I am. I am your Mother. You were born in an Air raid in the middle of a war To two people who loved each other. Our year together in the house in Hampsted has been the... happiest time of my life. Today you took your first steps. I am so grateful that I saw you walk for the 1st time with your father by my side. Max, My love... you are my world. I hope you will be able to forgive me. I hope you make it to Medicine Hat. I have a picture of it in my mind... and I pray Anna's eyes will see it. My beautiful daughter... I love you with all my heart. I hope you will live your life in peace. I rest - knowing your father will take good care of you. And I remain Your Loving Mother, Marianne Vatan.
