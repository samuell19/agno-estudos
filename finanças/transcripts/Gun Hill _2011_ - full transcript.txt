>> I swore to myself I'd never step foot back in the Bronx. But after 12 years of being locked down, I had to come back. * >> Another ginger ale. >> Why don't you go all the way with it? Order yourself a glass of milk. >> We both done. >> A little bit. >> When did you get out? >> A week ago. Thanks for meeting me. You're a hard cat to track down, you know what I mean? >> I'm busy. Started a new job. >> Still 5-0? >> Can't really talk about it. >> (scoffs) Some CIA-type stuff? >> Can't really talk about it. >> How Ma and Duke's doing, man? >> I see her every Friday. Bring her roses. Half the time, she doesn't even know who the hell I am. >> Tulips. >> What? >> Tulips are her favorite. >> Honestly, Bird, it wouldn't make a damn difference if I brought her a bunch of sticks and weeds. She just-- She just lost it, man, when you got locked up. >> She started losing it when Pops died. >> She lost you when Daddy died. The way you were out there, man, literally drove her crazy. You put her in a nut house! >> At least she still has a golden child. >> I don't need this, man. >> Hold up, man. Hold up. I, uh... I need some help. >> What? >> Brother needs some cash. Made a whole bunch of promises inside I can't keep. >> Hell no. I can't help you. >> Can't help me? What's this? >> It ain't much, but I send 600 bucks every month. Mom used to do it. But I took over six or seven years ago. >> Yeah. Got a big ol' head just like you. Can't believe you got a kid. >> No, Bird. You got a kid. >> What are you talking about? >> Dante Michael Evans, 11 years old, fifth grade. He's your boy. Yours and Janelle's. >> She said she was getting an abortion. >> Well, he looks a lot more like you than I do. >> How come nobody told me this? >> Janelle didn't want you to know. Mom wanted to have a grandson in our life, so we were just following the script. >> You want a drink? >> No, I'm good. >> I got somewhere to be. Where you staying? >> 32nd Street, east side. >> The shelter? >> You got any better ideas? >> I'll drop you off. >> * You say we're identical * But we couldn't be * Farther apart * One gets to shine * While the other * Gets left behind * If man did judge me * Only God knows * Take my chances * Out here tonight * Let destiny control * The floor... >> What's he like? >> Haven't forged a relationship. He gets a check every month. I get a picture every year. >> Move, go, go! (tires screeching) (gunshots) >> Damn, damn, boy! What the hell are you into? >> Nothing! >> Then who the hell are they? >> I don't know. >> Glove compartment. Safety off. All you have to do is pull-- >> I know! (gunshots) (tires screeching) (gunshots) >> Praise the Lord! (engine revving) (tires screeching) >> Trane, you all right? Trane, you all right? (tires screeching) (gunshots) >> (grunting) >> * Hold on * It's gonna be all right (tires screeching) * The grass is greener * On the other side (gunshots) * The mist of adversity * Can find paradise * It won't be long * If you be strong * And hold on * I wish I could fly today * To a place in the sky * Where the truth can't hide * Wish I could cry away * All the pain and the fears * And the guilt inside * Pray for a better way * I hope to God he'll open * Our beautiful eyes * Hold on * It's gonna be all right * The grass is greener * On the other side * It won't be long * If you be strong * And hold on (splash) >> Your face-- it's all wrong. >> What? >> Goatee. >> Trying out a new look. >> Oh. Keep trying, Mr. Stevens. >> When I walked through those gates, they told me I was free. That's a hard concept to swallow. (elevator whirring) I've been so used to people telling me when to eat, what to eat. (microwave beeps) Sometimes be wondering what you were doing, how you were living. (line ringing) >> Hello? >> Hi. It's Trane. >> Trane? >> Yeah. Think we can talk? I'm out front. I changed a lot in the last 12 years. Hopefully enough to make her think I'm you. >> Hey. >> Hey. >> How are things? >> They changed my hours at the hospital. Instead of being on five days a week, they got me doing three double shifts. >> You did it, though. >> What? >> When we were kids, I remember-- I remember my brother saying that you wanted to be a doctor. >> Please. Being an RN is a long way from being a doctor. Besides, Bird used to laugh at me. >> It's never too late, you know. You still have that dream. >> My dream is to make sure my boy doesn't end up a statistic. >> How is he? >> Trying to mess up in school right now. But I straightened his ass out, believe me. So what's up? >> I'm leaving New York tonight. Might not be coming back. >> Job stuff? >> Yeah. Got something for you. >> What's this? >> It's 10 "G"s. >> Where did you get this? >> My savings. >> I don't know any cops get paid like this. >> I'm in a special division that pays good. Besides, no one has to know. >> I'm the only one who has to know? >> That's right. >> Well, I have to know. Look, I don't need any trouble. >> I may not be doing right by the IRS, but I'm not out there robbing banks, okay? It's not like that. >> Then hold onto it. Look, six years from now, Dante will be going to Harvard or Yale or something. It'll come in handy. All right? >> Six years from now. >> Yeah. Or you might want to take that and fix up your ride. >> Yeah. Somebody tried to steal it. People ain't got a conscience, you know? Can I see your boy? >> He's sleeping. >> I won't wake him. I promise. * >> It's too bad you're leaving town. Right about now, he could use a role model in his life. A male one. >> I figured you wanted me to keep my distance. >> I never said nothing like that to you, Trane, and you know it. You may look like your brother, but you are completely different. I've always known that. (tires screeching) * (cell phone ringing) (cell phone continues ringing) >> Yeah. >> You set for tonight? >> What? >> You all set? >> Yeah. >> Don't be late. (pounding on door) (pounding on door continues) >> Who is it? >> Me, Trane. How long you gonna keep me out here? >> It's open. >> I've been calling. >> I got busy. >> Oh, you got busy. For two weeks? >> You know how it is. >> No, I don't know how it is. Why don't you tell me? >> Maybe we should, um, do this some other time. >> Trane, we've both been upfront with each other. Our careers come first. It's what we both wanted. And if things get too serious, our relationship is too serious. Those were your exact words. (cell phone ringing) >> Can't believe you still using that same line. Ever since we were kids, you've been telling chicks you didn't want to get serious. >> Just have him leave it with the doorman. Yeah, okay, thanks. (sighs) This new unit you're working is controversial, and I laid my ass on the line for CCF. The last thing I need is for people to think I'm motivated by personal reasons. >> I understand. >> Now you're patronizing me. Why do you look like that? >> I... grew a goatee. >> Yeah, I hate the goatee. That's not what I mean. You look different. Your eyes look different. >> Maybe you never really looked before. >> Maybe. Well, if we're gonna walk away, we should at least say good-bye. Agreed? * >> (heavy breathing) >> Martin, what the hell is your problem? * (distant sirens wailing) >> (moaning) >> I didn't know we were in such a hurry, baby. >> Sorry about that. >> (chuckles) Don't be. We friends? >> Hell yeah. Damn. Maybe me and you ain't so different after all. Maybe if I got the "A"s and "B"s, I would be you, you would be me. >> Right on time, Giant. Ready to do business? >> Yeah. I guess so. >> (chuckles) You guess so? Where's my money? >> Where's my stuff? >> Four pounds of ice. It's all there. Remember, Giant, if we get word of you selling outside of the hood, you are a dead man. Now, the 50 "G"s? >> You know, all this nickel-and-diming is for boys. Why don't we act like grown men up in here? 100,000 for eight pounds. >> What the hell you think you're doing? >> Renegotiating. >> I think I'll keep the deal in place. The money? Now! >> It's in my truck. >> Well, go get it. (snickers) If the money ain't there, handle it. >> You look nervous. >> Point the gun at yourself, I'll look more calm. >> I can give you boys the time of your life. >> Get the hell outta here. >> You don't know what you're missing. >> Let's keep it that way. >> I can't break cover. Get outta here. >> Throw me the keys. Throw me the keys! Let's go. >> Get outta here. (tires screeching) >> Move! (tires screeching) >> What the hell happened back there? >> I don't know. >> What do you mean, you don't know? Why did you deviate? >> Just didn't feel right. >> Didn't feel right? You could've gotten yourself killed. You could've gotten Danny killed. And why your windows are blown out? >> Kids tried to steal it. Chased them off. All I could think was, who the hell is she? Where the hell are we? And who the hell is my brother? >> Stevens. In my office. >> All this nickel-and-diming with your boys. Why do we act like grown men up in here? 100,000 for eight pounds. >> This ain't no one-man show. You want to be Kobe Bryant, join the Lakers. >> The only reason I-- >> Shut up. We had Raden inside for five months. Built a relationship with the number-one guy. And on the day we could have blown this investigation wide open, you go in there and screw everything up. Give me one good reason why I don't put charges on your ass? >> Instinct. >> Instinct. >> I told them I would spend twice as much money for twice as much product. The only reason he didn't bite, 'cause he ain't the shot-caller. >> Intel says he is. >> Brother, I know what I'm talking about. >> It's "sir." Or "Captain." >> Sir... or Captain... I know what I'm talking about. >> Danny Raden put in a good word for you. Said you had DEA training together. And it says right here you made 38 successful undercover arrests with them. In fact, it says one of your strengths is teamwork. Now, either they were lying about you in this report or you're not the guy they say you were. So which is it, Agent Stevens? >> I messed up. My bad. >> My bad? "My bad" doesn't cut it in here. "My bad" gets someone killed! Empty your desk. >> What are you doing here? Danny, you can't take this kind of risk. >> I was careful. No one saw me. Come on. (fighting sounds) >> (grunting) >> Excuse me. Thank you. >> Hey, what floor you hopping off? >> Five, please. >> No problem. We got you covered. >> Hey, hey, it's all there. >> Yeah. If it's all the same to you, we're gonna count it anyway. >> You two realize it's quite disrespectful to lay on another man's bed. >> It is soft, though. Satine? Right, Satine, isn't it? >> It was a Mets game. There was this assemblyman from Long Island. And they went to play the National Anthem. And I watched him. He was mouthing some of the words. This is an elected official who's faking the Anthem. That's when it started for me. >> I don't get these phony-ass politicians. They aren't about the people. They're about themselves. >> That's right. That's why there's a Founding Patriots. Let's honor our comrade. >> Ay, yo! >> What's up? >> Y'all take credit cards? >> (children playing) >> Whoo! >> You and Pops went on a fishing trip one Sunday. I couldn't go 'cause I got into a fight at school. Deep down, think you were happy when it was just you and him-- father and son. >> * Like Stevie, girl * You are a wonder * I wonder what spell * Am I under... >> I thought we were smoking weed. >> Trust me. This is like smoking 20 buds. >> That ain't crack, is it? >> You think I'd let you smoke crack? I'd kill you first. Here, here you go. >> Like this? >> Yeah. >> What are you doing? >> Your high's gonna last till tomorrow. You're gonna want to remember this. >> * They make it sound better * They want some reverb * Make it sound * A little better, like >> * Da da da da da-da >> * Hmm >> * Da da da da-da >> * She's my melody... >> Nice, huh? >> (chuckles) >> Founding Patriots pay $500 to anyone who can post a black kid smoking meth. >> What are you saying? They want to use the Internet to market drugs to black kids? >> I'm saying it's already happening. >> Which way is the IP address to a 16-year-old boy in Jamaica, Queens? >> Let's get this 16-year-old picked up. >> Done. >> Who's Web have dealing in Queens? >> I couldn't tell you. But there is another thing you should know. Last night, after they burned Andrew's body, some guy showed up, somebody important. >> How important? >> More important than Web. >> What if... what if we bring Web in? Show him everything we have on him? Can we turn him? >> He's too committed. >> To what? A war against black people? >> Flooding more drugs into the hood is not their end game. It's a military tactic. >> What's their end game? >> Eliminate anyone who does not share their beliefs. (cell phone vibrating) >> Oh, damn. Yes? Hello, Miss Logan. I appreciate the concern from the D.A.'s office. But we're doing everything we can to conduct a thorough investigation. One of our agents is very active on the case. >> You only have one agent working this? >> Just one from the inside. We had another agent undercover. Unfortunately, I had to dismiss him. >> If you don't mind me asking, who is this agent you dismissed? >> Trane Stevens. He's a loose cannon. >> I see. If you only want one active agent on this case, that's your call. But let me be frank. >> You always are. >> Yeah. The promise of this agency was to investigate, infiltrate, and impede criminal activity. Now, if I can't show results and soon, it'll be shut down and written off as a waste of money this city does not have. And for whatever it's worth, we all had high hopes for Agent Stevens. Have a good day, Captain. >> You do the same, Miss Logan. >> When we were teenagers, you got permission to call her Marva. Even though I was getting in trouble for staying out all night, I only wanted to call her Ma. Hey, Ma. It's me, Trane. Your son. I saw your grandson the other day. He's pretty amazing. And Janelle is doing a really good job taking care of him. Here, wait, let me do that for you, Ma. Remember you used to do this for us as kids? We'd go down to the botanical gardens, chase bubbles all day. You remember that? Care more about the bubbles than the flowers. Anyway, I... brought you something. Tulips. I just wanted to come by and... say hi. I'll see you later, okay? >> (whispers) You my baby, Bird. >> No, Mom. I'm Trane. >> You my baby, Bird. (computer beeps) (pounding on door) >> Who is it? >> Who the hell do you think it is? >> Ebony and Ivory. What the hell y'all want? >> We just happen to be in this crappy-ass neighborhood. >> (snorts and laughs) >> Your friend Kendra was rushed today to the emergency room. Look at her! They found her unconscious choking on her own saliva. By the time she was in the ambulance, she showed signs of heart attack. She probably had no idea she could O.D. on meth. They tried to save her, but they couldn't. She's dead. You made it happen. And you're gonna get jail for it. That's a promise. >> Wait. You're saying no jail time? >> You don't get to act like what you did never happened. But if you'll cooperate... >> Sit down. >> ...I'll push the D.A. for a lighter sentence. >> What do you want to know? >> That you're not dealing, so how did you end up with the drugs? >> Cousin gave some to me. She told me to pop as many cherries as I could. She said, after they did it once, they'd be hooked. >> And your cousin's name? >> If she finds out... >> I'm good at keeping secrets. >> Arlene. Arlene Carson. >> Thanks for the show, but what this got to do with me? >> You may be right. There's a good chance Web is not the shot-caller. >> Apology accepted. If you'll excuse me, I'm busy. >> You play this right, the Founding Patriots will come to you. You got your job back. I'm putting you on 60 days probation. >> I didn't ask for my job back. >> What's the matter, Trane? Did you get your feelings hurt? You made a dumb-ass move. And you should be happy as hell you getting a chance to redeem yourself. >> I don't need to redeem myself. (door slams) >> That him? >> Yeah, that's Freddy. He works for my cousin. >> Look, stay here. Keep your head down. >> I learned to go to war long before I got locked up. When you get asked somebody, you back it up at all costs. >> You all right? >> Let's go hurt somebody. >> (chatter) >> Slide up outta here. Freddy's busy right now. >> Yo, who the hell is you, man? >> We're Coke. And you're the no-name, cheap-ass cola. Do you know what that means? >> Yeah, it means you're dead men. (grunts) >> It means... you destroyed. Yeah. Competition. >> Know what I want you to do? I want you to tell all your customers you can no longer provide services for them over here. >> You fools even know who you messin' with? (gagging and wheezing) >> Shh. Man up, soldier. You good? Okay. I don't want you working around here no more, all right? I come around here, I don't want to see Freddy working. It's my block. Anybody asks you, I'm Giant. Cheap-ass, no-name brand cola? >> What's wrong with that? >> When you want to get someone's attention, you get loud. Founding Patriots got their product in the hood. Their connect was a sister named Arlene. She had Queens on lock. Captain said we needed the Patriots to come to us. So I got loud. Real loud. >> * But ignorance is bliss * Because their fists * Turn into a bullet * If their index finger * Pull it * Cameras coming * For the footage * Channel 9, Channel 11... * Another baby * For the reverend... * Taking action * In a matter of a second * Nothing matters when * You repping for your turf * Hold it down, have heart * It's the moral of the story * When you worry * Then you wicked * And you mental, never get it * It's a sickness * When you kill your own kind >> You all right? >> Yeah, yeah. >> The trial's coming up. I'll handle everything. You don't worry about a thing. >> Thanks. >> You just have to let me know what you told them. >> I told them nothing. >> Where did you tell them the stuff came from? >> I said I didn't know. >> And they believed you? >> I'm in here, ain't I? >> They tell you that girl died? >> Yeah. >> You was hitting that? >> No, we was just friends. >> Chick couldn't pace herself, I guess. >> Kendra. >> What? >> Her name was Kendra. >> The most important thing for us to focus on right now is making sure you get back home, all right, cuz? >> There she is. >> What did he say? >> Said he didn't talk. >> You believe him? >> I don't know. >> Agent Timms, how would you say Stevens did in the field yesterday? >> Let's just say I'm glad Stevens is on our side, Captain. >> He shot a man. Maimed another. Would you say that was necessary? >> "Necessary" isn't the first word that comes to mind. >> What word would you use? >> "Convincing." >> Captain, I have Agent Raden on the line. >> Danny, talk to me. What's up? >> We put a hit on Lee. There's not much time. Get him in solitary. (soft music plays) >> Your Uncle Trane was a starting running back at Evander High School. >> For real? >> Mm-hmm. >> Twenty-one, right? >> Twelve. >> Twelve, that's right. You know, I think your brother was jealous. Every cheerleader in school wanted to get with you. (chuckles) >> Well, I want to play tackle, but my mom said I can only play flag. >> Flag ain't a bad way to get started. That's how I got going. >> My father ever play football? >> He wasn't into sports like that. >> What was he into? >> Comic books. Music. He loved music when he was your age. >> What? >> I was just thinking how at one point he wanted to be a jockey. He wanted to ride horses. >> (giggles) Right. I never heard that one. >> For real. One summer we went to one of those carnivals across county. Had to be about 11 or 12. There was this smelly horse in a corral. My father bought him a ticket. And he jumped in that saddle. That horse started going crazy as hell. Just so happened to have anybody riding him. At least a week or two after that, all he could talk about was riding horses and becoming a jockey. >> So what happened? >> Guess he realized how crazy it sounded. >> You mean he quit. Right? >> Maybe. At some point in his life, he did quit. I really don't know. >> My mom told me not to end up like him 'cause he was a quitter. That's why that bastard got himself locked up. >> Watch your mouth, Dante. >> Edgar? >> Agent Faraj, one day we should meet under happier circumstances. >> One day. This is Agent Trane Stevens. >> Trane as in John Coltrane? >> My father was a fan. >> My wife got pregnant four different times when we rode between the sheets to "A Love Supreme." >> Thanks for sharing that. >> Though I'm partial to Charlie "Bird" Parker, the most innovative saxophone player of all time... >> Look, Edgar, we need to see the body. >> Yeah. Right this way. Stabbed 24 times. Very little subtlety in that. >> So you okay? >> I'm fine. >> Part of the job I hate. >> Look on the bright side. >> Bright side? >> Listen, they killed him because we got them scared. Scared cats make mistakes. >> What the hell is your deal, man? >> My deal? >> This kid is lying dead because of us. >> The kid is dead because he didn't watch his back. >> You expect me to believe you don't have a tinge of remorse about how we used him? >> Remorse is a waste of time. >> You throw up because something you ate? >> The smell. >> Don't believe you. >> You know what, I don't give a damn what you believe. Are you over here shedding tears for this kid? His cousin is out there making moves. >> (chatter and laughter) >> Y'all at my table. >> * Yeah, uhh... * You * You rock me every time... >> Get a bottle of your finest champagne. >> * Special way you grind... >> What I'm talking about, yeah. >> * Ooh, go, girl * I'll put you up * Against that wall * You got me * Standing at attention * If only... * Can't stop * What's going down tonight... >> The infamous Giant. >> Arlene. Sip some. >> You got a lot of balls coming up in here. >> Wanted to make it easy for you. Heard you was looking for me, so... Besides, I got a business proposal for you. >> Let's go talk. >> * Gotta give you * An applause... >> You've been particularly bothersome, my brother. >> Had to get your attention. >> Spotlight's all yours. Where you from? >> DC. >> They do drugs in DC, don't they? Why you coming to my neck of the woods? >> You know how the song goes. "If I can make it here..." >> That's a big "if." >> (exhales) >> Let me hear your proposal. >> You and me become partners. >> Partners. >> That's right. >> And how do you see this partnership working? >> I control all the meth in your neighborhood. >> Oh, is that all? >> I also get the nightclub. >> And out of curiosity, what do I get? >> You? You get the hell out of my way. >> Oh, well, now I'm really curious. What if I don't like your proposal? >> Sure you don't want to check with the white boys who employ you? >> You have to take it there. >> Be easy. I ain't the one to judge. But let's be real. We've always played a role in our own demise. >> One man's demise is another man's come-up. Besides, they give me product on the cheap. >> Long as you keep it in the hood, right? >> And that makes them my partners. Not my bosses. >> That makes them our partners. >> (snickers, then laughs) Somebody should've told you about me. >> They did. >> You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna sit at my desk, light a cigar, and watch them clean your brains off my wall. >> Might want to find out why the music stopped. >> Get up. >> Let me take that off your hands... partner. >> You wanted to see me, sir? >> Giant somehow muscled his way back into our lives. >> I don't understand. >> He's now controlling all of Queens. >> Damn. So what do we do? >> For the moment, we do business with him. >> This is the guy who killed Andrews. >> Unfortunately, Andrews was a casualty. >> A casualty? Sir, you were the one who taught me how to stand up and fight for our beliefs. >> We all have to answer to someone. >> Who are you answering to? >> It's classified. >> The camera is in this snap right here on the pocket. No audio, just picture. And of course, I will make it wireless. >> How many minutes can you record? >> Twenty. When you want to start recording, you push in this knob right here. When you want to stop, you open the pocket. >> That work for you, Stevens? >> This jacket has an old-school Members Only vibe to it. I guess I'm a little bit more... >> Stevens, put on the damn jacket. Word on the street was I took over Arlene's operation. I even ran her out of her own nightclub. Founding Patriots had no other choice but to come to me. >> Let's do some business. >> Business? (chuckles) The man in charge only talks to the man in charge. >> You're looking at him. >> Don't waste my time, playboy. Wait here. (gunfire) >> Web. >> Hello, General. This who I think it is? >> It is. Giant, meet the General. >> Looks like you're preparing for a war. >> We're in a war. >> Yeah, against who? >> Federal government. >> Wow. All because we have a black president. >> No. This is much bigger than the president. But he certainly hasn't hurt our recruitment. You try that target. Wow. At least we know you're not a cop. Stand down. >> Stand down! >> Stand down! >> What about you? White supremist? Terrorist? >> I'm a real American. >> What about the kids in the hood you trying to get the drugs to? They ain't real Americans? >> Drugs have always found their way into the ghetto. If not by us, it'll be somebody else. >> And that helps you sleep at night. >> Because of black violence, our gun rights are infringed. And we're forced to pay higher taxes so illegals can get free healthcare. Yeah, I sleep just fine. You think I have that wrong? >> Right or wrong, ain't a concept I subscribe to. >> So I guess that helps you sleep at night. >> Gonna make you an offer. I'll give you 200,000 ever month. In return, every month, you give me 16 pounds of meth, pure and uncut. I get to sell it wherever I want, to whoever I want, black, white, polka dot. >> I'm not in this to become a kingpin. What you see here, this is a movement. >> Movements have price tags. Wars ain't cheap, baby. >> Tomorrow night. Web will set up the meeting. >> Cool. owned flooring and towel business. Went bankrupt four years ago. Hasn't had a job since. >> Criminal record? >> Tax evasion. Three months in jail. >> It doesn't make sense. A guy this committed compromising for money? >> Everybody has a price tag, hillbilly. >> Oh, is that right? >> Damn right. >> I had 30 million laid out in front of me in a knockoff, and I didn't take a cent. So why don't you enlighten us? In that situation, what do you do? >> In that situation... I'd do the same as you. >> Now that we're a happy family again, let's talk about tonight. I want the team to meet up with Raden and see what he knows. And let's all be on the same page. >> Real politicians to talk tough and walk soft. However, we all must be committed to making this city a safer place for everyone. The decreased budget is no excuse. I was raised to do more with less, and that's what we intend to do at the D.A.'s office. Thank you. >> Hey. >> Hey. >> I just saw you on TV. >> How'd I sound? >> Like a sister you don't want to mess with. >> Captain tells me tomorrow's the big day. Be careful, okay? >> Ay, uh, why don't you come on by later on and practice being friends again? >> Good night, Agent Stevens. (cell phone ringing) >> Change your mind, didn't you? Hey. Yeah. Give me 20 minutes. >> I was a rookie. Never even questioned a witness before. She says to me, "Well, I'm too upset to tell you what I saw. Maybe if you come with me back to my place tonight, maybe I'll open up." >> So did you go? >> Hell yeah, I went. Hell yeah. And after about two hours of consoling her, I found out she never saw anything at all. But I did do about three or four more follow-ups just to be sure. Hey. >> What'd I miss? >> The usual. Mason's indiscretions. >> Danny boy. You want another one? >> Yeah, why not? >> All right. >> Something wrong? >> Trane I used to know only threw back Coke and ginger ale. >> Figure just this once wouldn't kill me, right? >> So what do you know about the meeting? >> They want to do it at the warehouse. I still have my wires in place. Let's keep it plain and simple. We show up with the drugs, you show up with the money. They put a hit out on a kid, and we didn't stop it. Let's get this one right. >> Once the transaction's made, Trane gives us a pass code. >> Yeah, so what's it gonna be? >> Pass code? Haven't thought about one. >> Well, how about something like "nice doing business with you"? >> Nice doing business with you? >> Yeah. >> You couldn't sound more like a cop if you tried. >> Let's go with "it's all good." >> It's all good. >> Works for me. >> Me, too. >> Yeah. >> I'm out. >> Hey, Sammy, want to do some role-playing tonight? You be the cop, I'll be the witness. >> You're a pig, Mason. >> (growls) >> Good night, guys. >> Let's roll, Mase. Let's roll. >> Hang on a second, man. About that fight we had... >> Water under the bridge. >> I wasn't apologizing. I was just wondering where you learned how to scrap like that. Not exactly what they taught us at the academy. >> Maybe hard for you to believe, but I had a whole 'nother life before you hit the scene. >> Right. High school football star. The kind of running back that relied on speed, not brawl. Am I right? Cats like you aren't usually the first ones to clear a bench when a brawl breaks out. Your brother teach you to fight like that? >> Yeah. >> He got out, right? You seen him? >> Said he was heading down south. >> Hmm. Let me ask you something. When we were DEA, remember when we did our entries? I always wanted to be first, and you had to be last 'cause you wanted to watch everyone's back. >> What about it? >> When the meet goes down, make sure that's the Trane that shows up. >> It's getting late. >> Yeah. (car starts) (computer beeps) (computer beeps) (computer chimes) >> All right, listen up. The team is arriving. >> Everybody get what they want this time. We all go home happy. You know what I mean? >> It's fine. >> Well, things seem to be in order. >> Same here. It's all good. >> All teams, move in. >> (chuckles) I like that. It's all good. (guns click) >> What the hell are you doing, man? >> This was never supposed to be a long-term relationship. This is about our freedom. >> You have no idea what it means to lose your freedom. >> Well, since you've never been free, you have no idea what it means to lose yours either. Do it. (metal clanging) (distant gunfire) >> Move, move! Move it! >> Timms, look out! >> Your choice. (police chatter on radio) >> Thanks for covering my ass. >> It's what we're trained for, even if you don't remember it right. >> What are you talking about? >> On our entries, I was never the last one in. I always led the team. What's the matter? Getting senile on me? >> Maybe I am. Hey, explain something to me. You used to swear up and down that you were too disciplined to drink alcohol. Then all out of the blue, you're kicking back beers. >> I was 15 or 16, my brother started drinking. Come in, stumble around after hanging out with his boys. I swore to my mother and I swore to him I'd be different. Maybe it seemed like it came out of the blue, but I just felt it was time for me to take off that cape. >> Guys, heads up. >> How is he? >> I'm sorry. He didn't make it. >> Thanks. >> I heard an undercover was shot. >> Timms. >> Is he okay? >> He's dead. >> Oh, damn it. You holding up? >> Yeah. >> Look, if you need anything, just call. >> When I was a kid, I thought about fishing. Instead, I spent all of my money on video games. You know, I missed out on good things like this. >> Uncle Trane? >> Yeah? >> How long does it take before we actually catch a fish? >> Well, that's the thing. You know, we, uh, we wait and we see. You never know, you know? You bored. >> Yeah. You? >> Yep. Whoo-hoo-hoo! Look at that, look at that, boy. This is what I do. >> What's that, what's that? >> This is what I do! Whoo! >> Air time. >> Watch that air time. Ah! >> Let's go, let's go. Ay, ay! >> Damn, bro. This is some life you have. After they killed you, man, I grabbed that bag of money, jumped on a highway, and I was gone. Know why I came back? Because of my boy. 'Cause of Janelle. More than anything... I just wanted to know what it felt like to be the good one. How's it going? >> All right. Looks like you had a long night. >> One too many beers. Guy from the fifth floor, right? >> Huh? >> Fifth floor. >> Oh, yeah. >> Guess I'm not the only one who's been drinking tonight. >> Think the Mets got a chance this year? >> More of a Yanks fan. (elevator whirring) >> (both grunting) (gunshot) >> Why'd y'all kill my brother? >> We didn't care about your brother. We were coming after you. >> What? Which brother do you think I am? Which brother do you think I am?! *
