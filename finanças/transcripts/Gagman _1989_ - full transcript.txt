Never cared for summer myself We'd only have spring, fall, and winter if it were up to me Say, mister Are you fond of dog meat? It's the only thing that keeps my energy up in summer It's not fattening, so you can eat as much as you want But I can't eat the stuff they serve at restaurants these days They get all these poodles and spitzes, any kind, really and just feed them water so the meat's all tough and there's nothing to eat on them When it comes to dog meat nothing beats a good old Korean mutt I was looking through the weeklies and I saw that Lee Ju-il paid over a hundred million won in taxes I guess they make big bucks in the entertainment business He wasn't born into money either I guess some people are just touched by a lucky star You must have always had something special, too, mister Making your way in show business and all Mind you, I've been going to the movies since I was in the womb They say my mother loved them So maybe that's why I've always wanted to be an actor I used to watch movies all the time You remember Kirk Douglas in 'The Vikings'? That was a great movie Remember when the Vikings come back and have a feast That scene where Kirk Douglas is eating a roasted chicken Mmm, mmm. He really goes for that chicken Poor guy Give him a rose and he would boil it and eat it like dog meat Poor guy That guy at the back, third from the right, with the glasses Could be a bank teller How he can afford to drink here? Somebody greased his palm for a loan, probably Poor guy Spends his days counting money and trying to get girls in bed Poor guy Number 17 over there, she's laughing on the outside But on the inside, all she cares about is her tips I see that lady came again tonight With a younger guy this time Poor woman Play her Beethoven and she would dance the jitterbug When did dreams give way to bread When did cash take the place of romance When did this world turn into a desert where not a single blade of grass would grow? What should Lee Jong-sae, genius of this age do in such a world? This has been your twittering skylark, your lovable buffoon The always humble and always available Jong-sae Comedian Lee Jong-sae I look forward to seeing you at the Mammoth again very soon Good night to you all Hello Yeah, it's me What's up?

Just a sec Michelle, Michelle? Michelle! Sorry, sorry How's my husband?

I see you've forgotten my name It's easy to remember if you think of skylarks My name is Jong-sae, Lee Jong-sae I sent you a script at your office some time ago I wrote that script - Oh, I see. - You have a break in filming tomorrow, yes? I need my sleep in the morning so what do you say about meeting at three o'clock in the afternoon? We could meet then to discuss the filming schedule Sir, your TV interview is ready to go OK Modern women are going through a crisis, in my opinion This film takes a serious look at the sex life of modern couples as sex becomes commodified in modern society Miss You You're known for being good at love scenes - Does that come from experience? - Well, I...

Your profession, sir The always humble and always available Comedian... Moon Do-suk at your service, sir You must make a mint, working in show business You know it's all over the news that there have been a lot of armed robberies lately - Banks have been robbed in full daylight - My goodness Corner shops, clothing boutiques, these guys stop at nothing They even threatened kids for money, you know - They've been at it every day - They wouldn't really threaten kids, would they? So there's a special directive in effect now for officers to make rounds visiting homes to check everything is fine I see Is this the bedroom? That's a painting Are you alright? I'm fine You should never leave cash or valuables in prominent places Oh, I wouldn't leave anything there - What about here? - Take a look? - Is it here? - Still cold Where is it? I don't remember It's here, isn't it? Where did you put it? Don't worry It's somewhere very safe Where is it! Where's the stuff? Where's the rest? The rest? Take them off Maybe I should get married take up flower arranging, cook dinner wash my husband's feet for him when he gets back early make tea for him I think I'll have just two kids One can be a movie star, the other a singer Know any eligible bachelors around here, mister? I'm not very demanding I just need someone with two cars and a house with a pool You know the first scene of our movie where the main character is attempting suicide with gas but the chair falls over and they fail? That's life Life always throws disappointment at you at the crucial moment I think that scene will really crack the audience up They'll be rolling in the aisles I bet a million more people come to see it because of that scene Sun-young do you know what my nickname was as a boy? It was Genius, Boy Genius I could read comic books when I was two years old When the neighborhood kids were playing milk caps or tag I was drawing comics My uncle said that when I grew up I should paint billboards for movie theaters I guess billboard painters made a lot of money in those days When I was in the 9th grade, we had a really cold winter That winter I had a lot of very serious thoughts on my mind What is the meaning of life? How are we supposed to live life, doing what? That was when I decided I would be a film director I thought that it was such a glamourous job From reading Lim Chang's 'Ttaengi and the Film Director' Sun-young The day has come The day the dark, interminable winter gives way to spring and countless people come to watch the film we made We'll celebrate our wedding inside the theater Sun-young, I love you Sir, you have to try some of these sticky rice cakes Real estate boom Housing prices soar Comedian Lee Jong-sae revealed to be leader of armed robbery trio Comedian Lee Jong-sae revealed to be leader of armed robbery trio I knew I shouldn't have sold the barber shop Police agencies on nationwide cooperative investigation alert I knew I shouldn't have sold the barber shop At this point we pretend we've been in a car accident Do-suk, you put some ketchup on to look like blood and lie in front of the car Sun-young, you shout "Help" three times in a very urgent voice Everybody got that? We get up at 8 tomorrow - Yes, sir - Hey, fatty lay off the breakfast in the morning We don't want you running to the bathroom again - Fine - Let's have a toast To one billion won Comedian Lee Jong-sae has been revealed to be the leader of a trio that has committed a string of armed robberies this past month Police have arrested a habitual police impersonator who stole cash and cameras from Lee Jong-sae's apartment The goods have been confirmed a match to those stolen in the robberies giving the police a fresh lead in the investigation Now, in a special segment we will hear from those who knew the criminal Lee Jong-sae personally Him? Let's see... what can I say about him... He had such a funny face You get a lot of onlookers when you're making a movie I thought he was one of them, so I let him off easy but then he appeared again a few days later with this big guitar case and he kept tapping it, like this If I had only known there was a gun in that case I would have socked him then and there I really don't know He was always such a polite man So pleasant and well-mannered You would never think he would do something like that He used to come here almost every day but I never saw him do anything wrong except for sneaking a read now and then without paying All of these answers leave us demanding who is Lee Jong-sae, leader of the trio of desperate robbers? Is he a megalomaniac suffering from a Cinderella complex increasingly common in young people these days? Or is he a friendly neighbor, the polite man next door? Let us now hear from Lee Jong-sae in his own words Your twittering skylark, your beloved buffoon, the always humble And always available Jong-sae, comedian Lee Jong-sae at your service, sir Soon the film will be ready for all 40 million of Korea's people to see I advise you to ask all the questions you want now as it will be very hard to interview me once the movie is out Interview my ass, what a nutjob How could someone who looks like that do all that stuff? Now for the weather forecast The heat continues with highs of 30 degrees Celsius nationwide and a discomfort index of 80 Be quiet If you open your mouth, we'll shoot Smile Smile naturally Sun-young Is my face really that funny? I never missed a single reserves training session in my life I even have a plaque from the district office saying "Best Barber" I haven't done anything wrong Is it a crime to want to become an actor?
