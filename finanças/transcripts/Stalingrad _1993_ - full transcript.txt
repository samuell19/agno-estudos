Hearts are trump. Yes, sir, Lieutenant. Onward and upward. This stuff's lukewarm. Tastes like piss. - You're gonna broil in the sun. - Butter for the fish... - That's enough, Lupo. - Have a seat. Excuse me, Lieutenant. No, you need spades, not hearts. Play a spade. Onward and upward, Rollo. Can I dry you off? - And this is mine. - No, no, no. - Why not? - Who won the trick? - I did. Fritz, when are you going to throw that camel piss away? It's a going-away present. For ten marks... I could get you a bottle. For ten marks I'd buy a palm tree... and plant it on your head. Whatever, you always get the best cards... and I'm horny as hell. I told you to leave him at the hospital, but no... Oh, God, sometimes I think... the Tommies smashed your head instead of his. It's his last day. Let him play. His wife's sure in for a surprise. Lupo! The doctor said he shouldn't drink anything. He's gonna have a headache anyway. Good Italian wine. - What time is it? - A little after 1:00. We can still find a whore. No, Lieutenant? Just look at all the women here. What about your wife's birthday present? That won't take long. Battle formation. Hey, comrades, help me with the Lieutenant. Another formation. This is getting old. That's my bottle. Look out! Be careful. Good Italian wine... I can't see. What kind of shit watch did you buy? Waterproof to 30 meters. You still gotta wind it, stupid. We'll take him like this. You get the chair. We'll take him like this. Who's got my jacket? Just like moving men... - My jacket. - Where's Rollo's jacket? Be careful! Men. The F?hrer commends you... for your fighting in the African Campaign. You played a large part in driving the English... back to the Nile. Crucial to the campaign were the storm troopers. You were chosen because you're the best. Never forget that. New missions await you. But before you will form the core of a new elite company... I am awarding you with a medal from the F?hrer... for your important role... in the heavy and glorious combat at El Alamein. Men, this is the new leader... for the first platoon, second company. Lieutenant von Witzland, step forward. Those to be decorated... step forward! Battalion, attention! Right! Lieutenant von Witzland, decorate your men! Why were you late, Corporal? Hospital visit to your predecessor, sir. Heroes aren't late, Corporal. Remember that. Sergeant... do you intend to accept the F?hrer's award... with your collar open? Yes, sir, Lieutenant. The award is revoked. Battalion, at ease! Dismissed! Storm troopers, be ready to move out in a half hour. Battalion dismissed! Don't leave me, men, don't leave me! Take me with you. Let's go. Move along. Viola! Good-bye, my love. What's up, Fritz? You in love? When's the wedding? Dearest Clara... Russia. Two thousand kilometers separate us. The distance is frightening. I won't hear from you again for quite a while. You should still write... but it will take your letters a long time to arrive. Will it be hard for you? I know if you had your choice, I'd be sitting... on a leather chair in your father's office... instead of on a bunk in a freight car. Please forgive me and try to understand my happiness. The uncertainty of the last few months has vanished. All of a sudden, my life has meaning, a goal. Before, everything seemed unimportant... but as I get closer to the front, my melancholy lifts. All the feelings I felt unworthy of... especially my feelings for you, burn bright again. You should see me... sitting surrounded by these stalwart men of ours. My men. I love them, because I know that only through hard work... will I earn their respect. But if you saw them, their smell might make you faint. Can't you count? You gave him the ten. Lupo was delirious, and he played better than you. Everybody screws up at first. Don't worry. He can't handle my strategy, can you, Rollo? Hey, those are mine! Not anymore they're not. Where's this crate headed, anyway? How about Stalingrad, gentlemen? Time to teach lvan a lesson. We'll take that city in three days. Cheers! Do you always look that stupid? If I didn't know better... I'd swear we passed this same spot ten hours ago. Russia's big, all right. After the war, everybody will get what he wants. I've already ordered 200 acres and 10 women. Here? Not if you paid me. Then stay in your lousy little town. Look! They're already working for us. Dig, men! Faster! - How do you say "faster"? - "Davai." "Davai" and "Ruki vyerkh" is all you gotta know. Adolf's gonna build me a freeway. All the way to Kirkov, or whatever you call it. This big country's just aching for a fleet of trucks. That's enough, Reiser. I find it touching that our Lieutenant... is keeping us company. Permission to ask a question, sir? Go ahead. This your first time to the front? Everybody starts somewhere, right? Should be fun. Make a bet with you, sir. I survive and you don't. For what stakes? From you, two cases of water. All right. And how's he supposed to pay if he's dead? This is pretty. And we're not even in Stalingrad yet. You want me to carry you, Russian pig? Move it! Get up, you Russian asshole. Go, go, go! What are you waiting for? Stop it! Leave him alone. Give him a chance to get up. Captain... I must protest about the behavior of your men. You want to protest? Tell the F?hrer. Lieutenant, over here! Lieutenant von Witzland. Storm Troopers Battalion 336, 2nd Company, 1st Platoon. Welcome to Stalingrad. All the specialists are finally here. Let me introduce Sergeant Pfl?ger, Battalion 179. He just returned from Voronezh. I'm glad you made it, Lieutenant. Now let's teach lvan how to swim in the Volga. - Cigarette? - No, thanks. Captain... I'd like to report an incident on the loading platform. I've already heard. It seems you like the Russians. Forget it. See that ammunition and hand grenades are issued. Then officers' briefing. Dismissed. Your uncle, Colonel von Witzland, is a good friend. He asked me to look out for you. "God is with us." These words are on every German's belt buckle. No shit. I never noticed. There is no holier work... than defending Western Christian values... against Eastern Bolshevism. And that's what sets you apart from the Bolsheviks... who have no time for God. You are never alone. Even when deep in enemy territory. M?ller, go! Yes, sir. This is crazy. They're shooting their own men. Damn artillery. Get down! He's not all there. Quiet, boys. Follow my lead. Men, our objective is that factory... at any cost. We'll start with that machine gun nest on the right. Whenever the artillery hits, the Russians hide. See anything, sir? It's suspicious. Here, Captain. We're at Frieda 20. Cease fire. I repeat, cease fire. Where are the five assault guns? We see nothing, as usual. As ordered, Major. All clear to target two, Captain. Fire only on my command and maintain silence. Understood? Let's go, men. Follow me! Shit. You klutz, Feldmann. It's not my fault, Emigholz. Now lvan knows where we are. I'm sorry. Oh, shit! Erwin! It's no use, boys. He's gone. Take cover! He said they're better than ours. They never jam. Chin up. Kill yourself some Russians with it. Smoke 'em out. Take cover! Hit the foxholes! Watch the gas tanks! Keep moving, men. We're getting closer. Go, guys! Forward! What's wrong? You stuck? Move! That way! Move it! I can't! I can't go! Get out of the hole. Pull yourself together, stupid! Let him go! Get his dog tags and go! If you don't come, I'm leaving. I can't help you anymore. Go ahead and die, then. It's your fault. Keep moving. Come on! I told you so, idiot. Follow me! We can't make it, Captain. It's impossible. Nothing's impossible, Lieutenant. Find a smoke grenade. Smoke grenade! We got to take out that gun. Fritz, smoke grenade! He's right, sir. We can't make it. Now you can make up for your mistake. You want your wife to be proud when you return, don't you? - Let me go, Captain. - No, I'll go. I won't let you down, sir. I know, Lieutenant. We'll cover you. Go! Or else we'd never make it. Feldmann owed us. Come on, men! Let's show them! Pfl?ger, go left. Witzland, go right. We must take this factory. Forward, men! Follow me! Cover us. Shoot anything that moves. Let's go, Fritz. Dieter. I shot him. Shoot already! Shoot me! - Hands up! Faster! Davai! - Ruki vyerkh! Now! I shot my friend! I did that! I shot him! - I don't deserve to live! - So what! Now just shut up! Don't worry. I did the same once. It's normal in close combat. If he'd been a Russian, you'd be dead. Mom, I'm sorry to leave you. Mom, stay here. What should I do... so we can stay together? Mother... wait... Pfl?ger, return! Take cover! Get a gas barrel! Next goal, the control room. 6:00 p.m. German time. I need two volunteers. - We'll go, sir. - Good. Come on, push! One, two... go! We'll get the Iron Cross for this. It'll look great on our coffin, Rollo. Take cover! Shit. Mother'll die if I get hurt. Finally, my Iron Cross. What're you waiting for? You want to lose another 300 men? Fight! Forward! Cover the exits! Stand still! Don't move! Ruki vyerkh! I shit my pants. I shit in my pants. You're not the only one. We have to keep an eye on lvan. "Small combat patrols." What'd you say? Only 62 of us left. For your collection. We started with 400 men. Tell everyone. Boost morale. At least we got lvan's stove. Damn stuttering. After every attack. Better to stutter... than to die. Right. Congratulations, kid. You're still alive. Have a smoke. - I don't drink my courage. - Asshole. What are you thinking? I'm not. If you start to think, you go crazy. So I don't. Have a swig of this. You've got a switch in your ear. Turn it... and you stop thinking. I'm sorry. Be glad you can still cry. Go on, have a good cry. Oils the system. What's your name? M?ller. We've got too many of those. At least 'til the next attack. You're a little go-getter, M?ller. GGM You okay, GG? What is it? The Russians tried to get a couple of their wounded, sir. So I shot. - They'd do the same. - Quiet! Anyone speak Russian? Me, sir. Ask if they'd agree to a short truce... to get the wounded. But that's forbidden, sir. The Captain would never allow it. Shut up, M?ller... you stupid ass, you idiot! I was only telling you standard procedure. Nobody cares about procedure in this city. Go ahead, W?lk. That's an order. Our Lieutenant asks... we want to get the wounded. We have to go first. I'm not going out there. Me neither. - Emigholz. - Here, sir. Pass it on: short cease-fire. We'll need medics. Bee one to beehive. Cease fire. We need medics. I'll go with you, sir. You'd better stay. You'll be okay. You look like my son. - How old is your son? - Three. Let me go. It's me. Kolya. I'll help you. Don't die. You bastards! Cover them! Hit the windows! Damn it! Hand grenade! - Shoot, W?lk! - Move clear! Don't shoot! Hold your fire! You'll get an Iron Cross for that, sir. Who opened fire? Who opened fire? Quiet, boy. The Russians started to attack. I saw it... and I shot. - You're full of shit! - He's right, Lieutenant. I should court-martial you. Go ahead! I'll tell about illegal contact with the enemy! We don't need a court, sir. Just give him to the Russians. You'll get in the newspaper. The obituary column. Asshole. Emigholz, you asshole! Always sleeping. My shaving kit. Who's got my shaving kit? You're still the prettiest. You should model for the cover of Today's Army. Grub's here! False alarm. They were shooting at the grub. The mail! Give it here. What'd the hashers make today? Horseshit again. They must be nuts. They should eat this crap themselves. Quit complaining, Rollo. Yes, I know. We're the beasts who invaded Russia. Rollo, I got something for you. No mail? She wrote me again that she's had a boy. That was in her last letter. But not a word about the cow that's supposed to calve. Oh, well, she's not the brightest. She wasn't good in school either. But the smallest. He married a dwarf. So? At least she's sweet. If I only knew that my cow was okay. Listen to this. Someone's been stealing our eggs. They should hang the bastard. You should talk. You loot every Russian corpse. That's different. They're not at war back home. Here's a letter for you. Asshole. From your wife? She's at home guarding our furniture. Schalke beat Hannover 3 to 1. Alemania lost again. That's in your letter? After the war, I'm gonna play for Bremen. I've already tried out. Soccer's bullshit. I have a rowboat. A two-seater. My old lady rows while I relax. By evening, she's tired and quiet. I have one too. Hares or rabbits? Big. Your boots... nails bad. Much cold... Russian winter. I can fix them. Me cobbler. Father cobbler. Grandfather cobbler. Quiet! What's "quiet" in Russian? What for? Let them sing. Poppy bread. Hey, Rollo. Granddad sent me beeswax. Cure for rheumatism. That's good. Something happen at home? Bomber attack? You could say that. While I'm risking my ass... my wife shacks up with a Frenchman. A POW. That's illegal. You sure? It's probably just a rumor. She wrote me herself. Wanted to tell me personally. We beat the French in six weeks. Of course, she's scared. I'll make the Russians pay for this. But he's French. I don't give a damn. What's wrong? Nothing. Drop it! His wife left him. It's better nobody knows. Kiss my ass! You all hate me! Especially you, Lieutenant! You think I'm a country fool! Leave me alone! You're my best man. Without you, we'd all be dead. And you'd have won your bet. Lieutenant, follow us! W?lk, Pfl?ger, cover the doors. Damn it, Pfl?ger, cover the doors. Ivan's everywhere. We've got to go down there, or they'll cut us off. Reiser! Here, sir. No contact, sir! Get your flamethrowers! Go! Just us? Emigholz and I will follow. W?lk! Yes, sir. Stay here. If we're not back in two hours, break through. Time check. 7:00 a.m. German time. Why me? I'm a radioman. Sir, let me come too. What the hell for? Let him come, sir. He might bring us luck. All right. Emigholz. The flamethrowers! Get up! Come on, get up! We're everywhere, and if I scream... You're dead. You too. At least say it properly. Is he dead? You're experts at killing. Quiet, or I'll shoot you. Shoot me and you'll die. You'd never get out of here. Come. - That's the wrong way. - Don't try to... How about a truce? I help you find your people, and you let me go. Why should I trust you? I could have killed you. With this? Yes, with this. Wait! What's in your other boot? My spoon. You want that too, Lieutenant? How do you know German? Okay. I give you my word as an officer. If you get me out, I'll let you go. You go first. Of course. Go slow. Are you okay? Shit, Reiser. We've got to keep moving. Thanks, Reiser. I won't forget this. Where's Emigholz? Help me! There he is. My leg! Quiet! If he doesn't shut up, I'll kill him myself. Your leg's fine. That's good, M?ller. Keep moving! We've got to get out of here. Move, men! Keep going! - Were Germans here? - They went that way. Be careful, girl. Thanks, Uncle. Medic! What's going on? Who's helping the wounded? Who knows? The Russians broke through somewhere. The Romanians, I think. - Get me out of here! - Lie down. - Hold still. I'll get a doctor. - Where are my boots? - We need a doctor. - I don't know... I need a doctor! Doctor! - I'm not a doctor. - Over here! Move! Get to work! Damn it, Reiser! Put the gun down. And let him die? Let them all die? - Get to work. - I'm not a doctor. Not another word! From anyone! Work! Edgar, the doctor's here. Help me. Drop your weapon. Captain, sir. Let me explain. - What's to explain? - We just came from the front. - We risked our lives... - Shut up. for our comrade. Where are you, Schroeder? Where's my bag? I expect a report about this unheard-of incident. Right away, sir. He's dead. This can't be. All for nothing. You're under arrest. Drop your weapons. What happens now? I didn't want this. Captain... I request to speak with the General. You think you're special? But it is your right. Damned Russian sympathizer. Take them away. To sum up the situation, gentlemen... we're in deep shit. Day before yesterday, the Russians... broke through the north, near Kletskaya. And now, they've broken through in the south too. They will try to close the circle around Kalach... sometime today. If they succeed, we'll be trapped. Keep smoking, Kr?ger. Captain. You must help me. Some of my men were arrested at the hospital. One of the men was wounded. Reiser lost control and threatened a doctor. Is this a proper report? Captain, we were trapped. The entire 6th Army is trapped! Pull yourself together. We're deciding the fate of an army... and you're crying about a couple of men. You can't do this, sir. The men believed in you, fought for you. Are we just a flag on your damned map? - Excuse me, General. - What's going on? It's about the incident at the hospital. I'll have the Lieutenant escorted out. Some of my people used force to get preferential treatment. Isn't that the young Witzland? Nasty business you're mixed up in. Will we be court-martialed, sir? This will not go unpunished. You'll learn. What's the problem here? Why isn't the road open? Look at all his medals. You like that, Rollo? Ask him if you can touch one. Asshole. It's your fault we're here. Break it up. Save your strength for the front. That's where you're needed. Everyone in the truck. - Move it. - You too. - But I'm... - That's an order! Since it's Christmas, I'm going... to give every man some bread. But you have to say pretty please. Say please, former Lieutenant! Please. Merry Christmas. Out of the truck! Get out! This is insane. They'll never make it to the front. Get out or I'll shoot! Shoot me! I don't care! - Leave him alone. - Go to hell. Ivan will finish the job. - What's that? - Hermann... - What the hell are you doing? - This man was shirking his duty. Out of my sight! Lieutenant, this is suicide. I refuse. Then go home. Rollo, I've had it! No more! Quiet, men! We've had it. No more! Shoot us all! I don't care anymore. Quiet! Listen up. The Russians tried to drive us out of Marinovka yesterday. Knight's Cross. Despite heavy losses, we held our position. I'm sure the Russians will try it again. But without your help, the line won't hold. Why is this position important? Marinovka is our best chance to break through... to General Hoth's tank division... which is only kilometers away. You all know... we must break out to survive. I ask you: Do you want to starve without fighting... to be responsible for the deaths of 300,000 comrades? Think it over, men. Is it worth fighting for? Some choice. We're going to make it. As long as the Captain leads, we'll fight. But if you fall, all bets are off. Agreed. Comrades, we're going to give these prisoners... a chance to redeem themselves. You'll be honorably reinstated after this battle. On my word. Witzland, give me your word as a German officer that you agree. Yes, sir. Good. Get ammunition... and form two squads. W?lk, lead the first squad. M?ller, the second. Dismissed. Wait. We don't have a chance. Why not surrender? You know what would happen if we did. Do we deserve better? I'm not a Nazi, Otto. No... you're worse, you lousy officers. You went along... even though you knew who was in charge. I told you what would happen. If I survive... I'm gonna forgive the old lady. I had them tell my wife I was dead. It's for the best. Believe me. But we'll make it home... someday. So what? Let me tell you a Christmas story. Exactly a year ago was the last time I was home. Christmas leave... because I destroyed three tanks. My wife and kids... met me at the station. They were stranger to me than any of you. She tried to understand. The kinder she was... the more I hated her. Finally I ran off and got drunk. There was nothing else to do. When I left the next day, my wife wasn't sorry. Just the children. I got back just in time for the new Russian offensive. And I was home again. The action's in here. Don't bother the officers. We grunts gotta stick together. - I finished high school. - You'd never know. Tanks! - Who's got the grenades? - Rollo. I look like my grandma. - Rollo, grenades! - Have fun. Fire! Get your ass down! Fire! Where's our artillery? You're the artillery. Get out! Go! Move! - I want out! Let me go! - Pull yourself together! Get down! Rohleder, get back! Come on! Shoot the big guy! They fit. Damn it. I just got used to this arm. You okay, Captain? The Russians can only hit my right side. I was lucky. It's my last... but we'll share it, Lieutenant. Thank you, Captain. Back to camp, men. Now we wait for Hoth's army. We'll take the cannon with us. Where are the horses? We're the horses. Everybody out! Now! Shut the door. It's cold. Get out. Leave's been cancelled. We're staying here. You're crazy! Everybody out! How often did the Russians make you shit in your pants? All right! I'm a coward! I'm scared! This whole thing makes me sick! Where's my pay anyway? I get 36 Marks a month, and if I don't get it right now... then I'm going home. - On foot. - Calm down, Fritz. The Russian army must be held. The fun's not over yet. Move it! Faster! Get moving! Quit loafing! Get moving! Everybody out! Now! You lazy bums! In the name of the F?hrer. Carry out the order as given. - Understand? - Yes, sir. We're not finished, Lieutenant. Follow me with your men. Gentlemen. Keep moving! Over there! Can they do this? It's to remind us which side we're on. Listen up! These civilians... are guilty of sabotage. They are to be executed. Positions! They started the killing yesterday. There's no sabotage. They're just out of food. I can't do this. If you don't, GG, you'll be up there next. Nothing we can do. At least their suffering's over. I can't. That boy there. He worked for us. And for lvan too. Shut up. What the hell's going on here? We must hurry. Others are waiting. Captain, you can't do this. I can vouch for that boy. You again. Does the boy appeal to you? Remind you of someone back home? Child murderer. Shut up, asshole. Shut up! You want to be busted again? Return to your post. You're an officer. Do something! - I'll handle this. - Quiet! Step forward, Corporal. I'll kill that bastard. Let him go! Let me take his place, sir. Come to attention when I address you! Are you refusing to obey a direct order? Let the boy go, sir. That's enough! This is not open for discussion. If you miss... you'll be up there next. Back in line... Corporal. Do you want to take command? And you're from an officer's family. Take aim! Why doesn't he do something, Fritz? We didn't kill the boy... so you could let us die out here, Lieutenant. If you were too afraid to give the right order... then at least give it now. Let's get out of here. We'll go to the airport. Somehow I'll get on a plane, even if I have to wound myself. Calm down, Fritz. I'm leaving. I mean it. Know what you're saying? Desertion! Talk to him, Lieutenant. I no longer feel bound by my oath. After all that's happened... I think you have the right to leave. I'm not going to let you get us in trouble again. That's enough! Understand? You're not being reasonable. You're just scared, Rollo. Kill me. You're a sergeant. It's your duty. Fritz... stay here! I pity you, Rohleder. You fight to the end. You're already dead. Who's coming with me? Say hello to your son for me when you get home. What about you? I know it's crazy, but I can't. I just can't. A year ago, I would have been first... but now... I'll keep him company. Good luck. I think you'll lose your bet with the Lieutenant, Rollo. Shit. Where the hell are we? No idea. I'll ask for directions. Where is Pitomnik? Bread! Bread. Head west... large ravine... 5 verst to the airport. Thank you. Come on. He has a wounded tag. You can still read the signature. Doctor Heider. This is our pass. We'll get home with this signature. Everybody look for one of these. And put on bandages. We're wounded. For you, Hans. Quiet, man. You're not the only one in pain. Ah, powder burns. Obviously a self-inflicted wound. Close combat. In the trenches. - Take this traitor away. - No, Doctor, no! I can't do this. They'll catch us. I'm going back. It's too late for that now. Just don't screw up. You either. At least I'm not the only storm trooper here. They should take more of us out. We're needed elsewhere. I have witnesses, Doctor! What's wrong, son? Fever? I can't read the signature. Who's your doctor? Can't you speak? Doctor Heider. Excuse him, Doctor. He's in shock. Tank battle. His best friend was blown apart. Here, son. For the fever. You'll be home soon. Keep an eye on him. Yes, sir, Doctor. Move! Where's the Lieutenant? Hans, we're over here! - Be reasonable. - The plane has to unload. Over here! You pig! Let me through! Filthy pig. Here come our heroes. Assholes. Hans, where are you? GG, hold on to me. You bastard. You dirty bastard. You could have made it. Comrade... Shoot me. Welcome to our grave. Careful. Not so hard. Are you hurt? You know how fragile he is. It's only rash. He's covered with boils. The Captain, he got the worst. No planes for you? No. You old muskrat. Guess who saved you? That'll piss him off. Leave the Captain alone. My foot. This damn pain. I wouldn't do that. I told you not to do that. Great. Now puke on him too. Give me a butt. Give me a damn butt! I have no luck with my right side. It's nice to spend some time dying together. Play something. Stupid damn medals. Stand up! Stand up, men! And come to attention. I want a report! Where's your unit? We're not in the middle of nowhere. We shoot looters in the German Army. Or have you forgotten? Stay where you are! Stop! GG, GG... GG, he can't do this. You... you can't do this! Don't die, GG. We'll make it home, GG. We'll make it home. Lieutenant... arrest that man! And get me out of here. You want a report? The Russian boy was named Kolya. And his name was M?ller... like a lot of others. You can still make up for this! You must be very hungry. I have supplies. The white house. By the theater. We'll drive there. Germans don't shoot Germans. I'm an officer. You can't just leave me here! I can't believe it. Bastards. Stop it. You'll get cramps. By rank. We'll go by rank. You're first, Lieutenant. So, GG. Some for you. Dead Rollo... cheers. Dead Otto... dead Fritz... to our grand offensive. Three's the trick. Hearts are trump. Hey, Fritz, hearts are trump! There's a spot of blood on the 10 of spades. Just so you know. Damn... right side. Three play cards... while the other's getting laid. I'm not pretty enough for you? I want a woman once more before I die. You're all that's left. You could do me one favor. - Shoot me! But you're afraid! - Stop it! You've probably got an innocent girl at home. Do you love her? Yes? Oh, yes! A German soldier's love... increases with every step between him and his woman. But you'll never see her again. Poor fool! You probably never even slept with her. Maybe you should have some Slavic meat after all. There! As soft and white as your virgin's! Fuck me and shoot me! There! Shoot yourself. I'm tired of killing. - Get out! - No! You bastard! You dirty bastard! I couldn't do it either. I'm the Germans' whore. A collaborator. Nonsense. They forced you. I should have killed myself. I thought that too. Quit slowing down the game. Spades are trumps. There's some blood on the 10 of spades. You know us very well. I know you through and through. My mother was German. I once loved your language. I'll never forgive myself. I had the strangest dream. I had to piss, but I couldn't because I was sleeping. Damn dream. Better than pissing, right, Lieutenant? Have some real food. Then try again. I'll teach her to be nice to you. Don't touch her. I mean it. Nobody touch her! Everybody up! Rohleder, come here. Yes, Captain. - Don't do it, Rollo. - If he doesn't, I'll shoot you. Stay there. You wouldn't hurt your Captain, would you? Come here. Yes, sir. I won't court-martial you. You were good soldiers... until you chose to survive at any cost. Shut up. Don't move, Reiser. Do you think you can live with yourselves as deserters? Shut your damn mouth! Don't kid yourselves. You should know you'll always be soldiers. War is your home. You're already dead! For two years, I've prayed to be killed. The flesh melts from my bones... and seeps through the rocks. But you know what? I piece myself together again... every night. And none of you can kill me. None. You used to be an officer! Quit laughing! Where's the front? I demand a report! That's an order. Heil Hitler! Let's get out! Wait, Captain. I'll help. Fresh air! You're all crazy. A short rest, Captain. Then we'll go. Don't fall asleep. We'll go soon. Where's the front? What's going on? General... Sergeant Rohleder, Iron Cross. Give me your weapon. Come on, give it to me. I'm a deserter. Don't talk nonsense. Stand up. - Where's the front? - Come with me. Gentlemen. The front. Where's the front? We'll go soon. Don't fall asleep. I'm not going to die. You know, Hans, at home... when you die as a soldier... at least they're proud. That's something, isn't it? Siberia? Not me. I'm cold enough. I'll get you out. I'm going with her. We won't even get a hundred meters. But what's the difference? That way. Let's go. It's dark enough. We made it. The best thing about the cold is... you feel nothing. Everything freezes. It's too cold to cry. Get out of here, Fritz. I mean it. Go! The best thing about the cold is... You don't have to worry about sunburn. Ever been to the desert? You'd hate it. It's so hot... you're always... sweating. You think you're melting, like butter. The desert is shit. Except for the stars. They're so close... You know?
