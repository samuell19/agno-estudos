Hey, it's John. Leave a message. Or don't hey, it's me. Um, I'm right outside. Uh, will you pick up the god damned phone please? John, I can see your truck, okay, so what, are you hiding in there? I need, I just... I need my stuff. John, I can't believe you did this. I really, I really hate you. Alright. My head is exploding and I'm coming in. You've got my cameras, so I need them. Happy birthday! Are you there? I'll come by around six and I'll bring some champagne. I can let myself in if you're not back. John? John? John? John, it's Adele. Where are you? John, I really need my cameras. My show is hung and I want to photograph it today. John, it's Lee. Call me. It's Adele. If you don't show up today, I'm going to have to let you go. Hey, it's me. Um, i'm right outside, uh, will you pick up the god damned phone please? John, I can see your truck, okay, so what, are you hiding in there? I need, I just... I need my stuff. John? I can't believe you did this. I really... I really hate you. Alright. My head is exploding and I'm coming in. You've got my cameras, so I need them. People go missing all the time. They all just want to start over. I don't think he's like that. You want to describe him for me. Of course. He's um, 5'10", uh, he has light brown hair, uh, green eyes. Uh, he has a tattoo of a bluebird on his right arm. Good, that's going to help. So, um, you went back to his house to take some more pictures. No, I left my cameras there. You left your cameras? Something else you want to tell me? Um, we went out for a few months. Um, we broke up a couple weeks ago. I haven't seen him since. Maybe he just doesn't want to see you. Something's wrong. Hi, great work. Oh, thank you. Jesse! I'm so glad you're here. I've missed you so much. Dad made me come. You look great. No I don't. I'm so glad you're here. You just said that. Jesse I hate that I hurt you. I never meant it. It doesn't matter what you meant. It's just what you do: You hurt people. Jesse, hey. Hi. Sorry I'm late honey. I know. Congratulations. Oh, thank you. It's beautiful. Well, here we are. One big happy family. Lee. David. Really beautiful work. I'll be reviewing it next week. Thank you David. Um, do you know my husb-my ex-husband Malik jamil? Mr. Jamil, David Ramirez. I'm a great fan of your work. Thank you. Of course. This is our daughter, Jesse. She's a very very good photographer. Perhaps you could do a studio visit with her. What kind of work do you do Jesse? Um, self portraits. She does these grids of self-portraits. They're amazing. David's an art critic. I know, I know. Can we go now? Why don't we look at the show first, okay? Okay. It was nice meeting you. You too. Excuse me, David. Of course. Oh.. Do we know each other? No, I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else. Sorry. There you are. Hey. You look beautiful. You're just saying that because you want to have sex again. No, it's true. You are beautiful, and I want to have sex again. Mom! It's okay, it's okay. What medications are you taking? She's taking anti-anxiety medications and sleeping pills. And she has been sleeping most of the time, and she hasn't spoken since Saturday. She hasn't spoken at all? Not that I know of. I have been taking care of her since the incident. Lee, you'll meet your therapist tomorrow. Would you like to get some rest now? Lee? I'm Dr. Bloom. Very nice to meet you. Come in. I looked at your book. You must have seen a lot of suffering. Your ex-husband told me that you were injured in Somalia. Perhaps it's hard to revisit the photos after what happened. I hear you've been having some difficulties with your daughter. Are you upset with your daughter? Somebody else? What is it, Lee? I think I killed someone. Hello? Somebody? H-Hello? Hey. Hey. I need some morphine. I'll get the nurse. Ahh. She says she needs some more morphine. I love you mommy. Nice dreams? Out of water. You're still here. Well, I went to physical therapy, but otherwise I've been watching out for you. Do we know each other? You just looked like you needed help. Thank you. Oh hey, you're awake. Uh, barely. I brought you this. I know it looks really aggressive, but deep down it's really sweet. You're still here? You know what, uh, I'll see you later. Bye. Who is that guy? I really don't know. They said I was injured in a suicide bombing in Somalia. I don't remember much. Geez, that's terrible. Yeah, how about you? How'd you end up here? I drove off Mulholland drive. I was swerving to avoid a coyote. Oh, that's pretty terrible too. No, that's not the same. Why? We both almost died. Yeah, but you almost died for something. I almost died for a lot of reasons but they're not all admirable. Are you okay? Mm. I noticed Malik jamil visiting you earlier. That's pretty cool. He's a great journalist. Yeah, he's a great husband too. You're married to him? Not anymore. How about you, you got anyone? No. I kind of like being alone. You don't want to have kids, get married? Well, I used to want that. But... I don't want it anymore. That would be a great cover. You're right. You have such a good eye. Who is this girl? Hawa. She was my translator in Mogadishu. We were buddies. Jesse, um, I was thinking, i'm going to make some big changes in my life. What do you mean? Um, I don't want to go away anymore. Well, what are you going to do? Oh, I talked to the times about shooting some portraits. Of like terrorists and murderers? Yeah, if the past is any indication, then probably. The main thing is I want to be close to you. That's a really cool bracelet. It's cool. That's from Mogadishu. No, you should keep it. Here, no, no, no. I want you to have it. Well, I don't think he would just disappear. Well, how could you know that? You knew him what, three months? I'm still a little bit confused. You broke up with John, but you're in love with him. It wasn't right for me. He had been through too much stuff. He had never been married. So you left him because you felt he couldn't commit to you? Yeah, I guess. Aren't we supposed to talk about my parents or something? We can talk about your parents. Well, um, my dad was basically an asshole. How as he an asshole? He worked for the FBI. He was a mean guy. He certainly was not nice to my mother. Luckily, he wasn't around a lot, so... John was nothing like my father. Hey. Um, I'm Peter. May I join you? I have the appointment with Dr. Bloom right before you. It's a birthmark. It's like a rorschach test. A lot of people think it looks like a barking dog. I think it looks a little more like Michigan, but... So, may I join you? Yes. They stock these just for me. I read three different studies that said sardines are really good for depression. They also help with anxiety and ocd and add. You look a little s-a-d. I am sad. Well maybe you could get outside, go for a little walk. Hmm, about ten months? Ten months? Mhmm. Do you ever want to leave? Well I had to take a five-year lease out on room 11e. I tried to go back to work after about four months, but I kept having panic attacks. That's why you're here? Panic attacks? No, I uh, I had a client. He was up for murder. I managed to get him off. And after a few weeks, he showed up at my office. He had become fixated on my assistant. And he followed her into the bathroom and blew her head off. And you feel responsible? Well, I know it's not my fault, but my unconscious begs to differ. I met your patient, Peter stone. He seems normal, except for the sardines. He's been here ten months. He must be about to leave, right? I can't discuss my other patients. Are you concerned that he may be leaving soon? I wasn't thinking that. He seems nice. He looks exactly like John. Do you think that's maybe why you responded to him? Because he reminds you of John? No, he's nothing like John. He just looks like him. Perhaps you want to see him as John. And how is he different, John? He, every way. Peter is friendly, he's warm. John was, uh, more complicated. Got it about eight years ago in an optimistic moment. Because blue birds are lucky? Oh yeah, just not for me. You're so pessimistic. If you knew anything about me, you wouldn't say that. Sorry. I didn't mean to be presumptuous. Look, I didn't mean to be so sharp. I've just had some bad luck. Religious differences have precipitated countless wars. Now, how can we explain all this killing in the name of god? I used to teach history at a private school. This student, Emma, she was my best student. One day she gave me a lift. My car was in the shop and she insisted on taking me home. Why are we stopping? Can we talk? Well, why don't you come in after class tomorrow? I have to talk to someone now. Carl broke up with me today. I'm sorry, I... I know how painful that can be. But you've got to take me home. I just need to talk to someone. I'm in really bad shape, okay? Please. Will you just hold me? I can't do that. Okay. Okay. Emma, you really, you gotta go home now. Will you fuck me? Come on. She never made it home. Her body was found the next morning. Strangled. They also found my phone, and then later they found my hair on her clothes. I spent the next five years in prison fighting to reopen the case, and then one day this woman walks into the da's office and turns in Emma's ex-boyfriend. That's a horrible story. Um, I was just thinking, I was wondering, um, maybe I could call you when I get out. I mean, I'm not asking you out. It's not that, um Your story, just kind of blew me away, and I was thinking I maybe could photograph you and try to communicate what you've been through. I've had my photo taken a lot. I just thought I could do something different. I'll think about it. Little more. You're doing great. Could you step to your, to your left a little bit? Little more? Good. Thank you. Yeah. Big place. You have a lot of stuff to protect. How long have you worked here? Uh, about a year and a half. It's a good job. For me, anyway. It's quiet. I don't have to listen to anyone's bullshit. You're reading St. augustine? I am. So that's what you do in your off time? You read? Mhmm. Yeah, and I write a little bit. You write? Mhmm. Can I read something? No. Maybe someday? I don't know, maybe, yeah. Hey John, hey man. Who's that? That is Thomas. He's an old high school friend of mine. He's staying in one of the rooms. He lost his job and he can't pay his rent, so, hm. Thomas? Hey. This is Lee. Lee, Thomas. Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. So you're the photographer? Yes. I pictured you younger. Thomas... Well what did you, what did you tell him about me? Nothing. Just that you were very persistent. Yes I am. May I take a picture of the two of you together? Yeah. Sure. Maybe sit down? On the bed? Yeah, that'd be great. Nice. Oh, that's not loaded. I just use it to scare people off. May I? Sure. Did you carry a gun when you were covering wars? No, never. I had a Turkish boyfriend who taught me how to shoot. I killed him. Look, Lee. Sometimes people believe they've committed a crime, and then find out that it didn't actually happen. It happened. Where's the body? I don't remember. Yeah, I read that one of your photos helped close an infamous afghani prison. Oh, so you've been reading about me. Well, I'm a defense layer. It's my job to get the dirt on people. Okay, and I'm a little nosy. I had a guy at my office do a search on you. Well, at least you're honest. Do you ever find missing people? You know someone who's missing? My ex-boyfriend. I think he may have been murdered. I'm sorry, that's horrible. Yeah, it is. Why don't you let me look into it for you. Thank you. That would be... That would be great. Hope you've got room for a giant camel. Hey. Hey, Jesse. I didn't know you were coming. Yeah, mom said I could store some stuff in here, so... I sent this to Jesse from Egypt for her birthday. Yeah, it's exactly what a four year old wants. You were seven. I'm gonna go get another key. Hey, I brought US all sandwiches. I thought maybe we could have lunch together. That's great, I'm starving. Oh, I'm good, thanks. John? What? Okay, sure, yeah. Coming through, oh, oh, easy with that. You got it? Yeah. Hey, there's a lot more in the u-haul. Back it up, back it up. I was like stuck with my friend, and I had to like, get on the balance machine and like, figure out how to gain my balance, because I was about to be a brontosaurus. Are you gonna finish the rest of your sandwich? No no, you have it. Mom! What? I'm eating. Anyway, so on the back of my neck, there was a tattoo that said "brontosaurus" so that meant that's what I was going to be. Which was cool, but I woke up like, right before I was about to transform, so, I never really got to see what it would be like to be a dinosaur, which is... Jesse, that's not cool. What? The joint. It's not like we're going to get caught, right? Well, that's not a chance I want to take, so. Jesse, maybe just wait 'til later. Okay. So John, how do you like posing for my mom? Jesse, I think you're embarrassing John. No I'm not. Am I embarrassing you, John? Maybe a little. See, I told you. Stop picking on me. I'm not. Yes you are. Okay, I'm going outside. Honey... I'm sorry. I'm sorry she put you on the spot like that. I think sometimes she wants me all to herself. She's a little old for that, don't you think? I like that. Yeah. That's nice, I like that. Mm. I like these. She's talented. Yeah. Since she's been at art school, her work has really matured. You should see the grid portraits in person. They're amazing. I'd love to see them sometime. Well I suppose we should try to get some sleep. Oh. I'm so tired. Yeah, me too. Thanks. Yeah, goodnight and good morning. Good morning. Right. You looked so young. Innocent. Hm. I was a different person then. You stand up. Just put it in front of your chest, maybe? Maybe better to sit down. Maybe you'd be more comfortable. Yeah, I think so Hold on one second. Now let's just hold it over the lower half of your face. Like that? Yeah. What's that sound? That's peacocks. My landlord raises peacocks. Doesn't that drive you nuts? Oh yeah. Thanks John. Thanks for all your time. I think we've got some really good photographs. I'll send you some prints when I'm done. So does that mean we're not going to see each other anymore? Hey. Tell me what you want. Let's not talk. Let's not talk. I said it was good sex. That's talking about it. Was it different than sex you'd had before? I've had a lot of different kinds of sex with a lot of different kinds of guys. Look, Lee, I'm not trying to pry. You came in here convinced that you killed this man. I'm just trying to find out where the fantasy came from. You don't know that it's a fantasy. Why don't you tell me a little bit more about your relationship with John. I thought maybe I should have another shower. No, it's great. Beautiful. So moving. Oh, sorry. Hi honey. Where are you? At a friend's. I have the flu. Will you come take care of me? Yeah. Thanks mom. I'll come now. Okay. I love you. Jesse's sick. I've gotta go. Oh no, what's wrong with her? I don't know, the flu? And you haven't told her about US yet, huh? No she had critique at school that didn't go well. So when are you going to tell her? Soon. I have to go. I'm taking this. Okay. Tell me more about you and Jesse. Um, I had her when I was really young. I had just started seeing Malik and I got pregnant. I stayed home for the first 8 months, but then I got a chance to cover Afghanistan. I couldn't, I couldn't say no. That must've been a very difficult decision for you. That's the problem. It wasn't. It wasn't a difficult decision. I missed Jesse like crazy, but I kept going away. I don't think she'll ever forgive me for not being around. I don't blame her. Why should she? But you're trying to make it up to her. Isn't that what you've been telling me? Yes. But I keep fucking it up, just like all my relationships. I like you. A lot. I shouldn't have said that. I knew this was just casual. It's not casual to me. Then why are you acting all weird all of the sudden? Sorry I can't always follow your protocol. Look, um, I don't think we should keep seeing each other. What? Lee, I'm not a good guy. Are you seeing someone else? No, I'm not seeing somebody else. Then why aren't you a good guy? I'm just not, okay. You just have to take my word for it. Okay, I'm going to go. John, you spent five years in prison for a crime you didn't commit. Maybe you should give yourself a break. So Adele made you work an extra hour? I just didn't think that was very fair on my birthday. It's not. You're still taking morphine? Every once in a while. You're in that much pain? Sometimes. Why are you so concerned? I love my fish. Good. Mm, wait wait wait, don't put them down yet. Okay. I love my fish, I love my fish. Okay, turn around. Smile for me. Smile. Oh, you want to do the miserable one first? What the fuck? Jesse and I, we, um, we went out for a month. After the, after that day you put your stuff in storage I stopped seeing her. You went out with Jesse. No, Lee. Oh, fuck. Lee, when I... Look, I wanted to tell both of you, okay, but I couldn't. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Lee... Lee! Jesse, wait! Please, I didn't know. Jesse, please. How could you do this to me? I never would have, I didn't know! You didn't want to know. It was so obvious that I liked him. I mean, why do you think I visited you in the hospital every day for hours? Why? C-Could you please, could you just leave me alone from now on, please? Because you've never been a real mom to me. Ever. You've never been there! You just pretend like you give a shit, but you don't! All you do is care about yourself. Just stop, okay? I wish that that fucking bomb had killed you. Lee. Hey, hey, look, it's okay, it's okay. Hey, hey, hey, okay. Okay. Lee. I have some information on John for you. Oh. What's wrong? Nothing. Well, I'll give it to you later. Right. Lee? What do you remember about what happened between you and John. I told you. We fought, we broke up. What else do you remember? He was having an... He had an affair with Jesse. Did he know she was your daughter? And you found out that night? Yes. Well, there's a lot to explore here. I think you want to kill John. He betrayed you, he hurt Jesse, he ruined your relationship with her. You know, this is just a lot of fucking bullshit. There is not a lot to explore here. Hey. I don't blame you anymore. You didn't know. And I know it was his fault, and... I just want to forget him, you know? We should just both forget him. I love you. I love you so much. Me too. I drove your car up, in case you want to escape every now and then. As long as that's allowed. It's allowed. Dad's gonna pick me up later. Who is it? I'll get it. Oh, hello you're Jesse, right? Yes. I guess she's been talking about me. Well, only in a good way. She adores you. I'm Peter. Hi. Hi. You know, if you actually ate food that tasted good, you might feel better. You want to try? Mm. I feel better already. Well good. If you started eating food like this, you'll be out of here in no time. Actually, um, my shrink and I were talking about terminating. You're leaving? Not yet, but... I could always have a relapse. Well I think you seem okay. Okay. She seems to care a lot about you. In spite of everything. What do you mean? I just haven't really been there for her. You said you had some information on John? Yeah, I... I had a private investigator do some digging around. Apparently the situation with John and his student wasn't so clear cut. What? Well, John testifies that he never had sex with the girl. He, he told me that she came on to him and he resisted. That's not what the girl's ex-boyfriend said. In his confession, he claims that he watched John and the girl have sex, and that's why he got so enraged. Apparently, John never really got over his guilt for the girl. It seems he tried to kill himself a few months ago. He ran his car off the road. No. He told me that was an accident? Well that's not what the evidence suggests. If you knew anything about me you wouldn't say that. I drove off Mulholland drive. I was swerving to avoid a coyote. Her body was found the next morning, strangled. They also found my phone and then later they found my hair on her clothes. Hey! Hey, look, hey, hey, okay, okay. I can't believe you did this. I had just gotten out of the hospital and she called. I was lonely. You should've told me. I wanted to. I tried to. Why didn't you? John? John? John? He killed himself. He was gone when I woke up. The morphine was gone. This may be another fact, you see. He was suicidal. He'd tried before. Alright. Let's say he did commit suicide. How would that make you feel? How do you think it would make me feel? Horrible. Guilty. What would you feel guilty about? Everything. I initiated the relationship. I asked to photograph him. I kissed him. I made everything happen, and I never saw that Jesse liked him. I should've seen it. She's trying to forgive me. She was here yesterday. Does she know that John's missing? No. I haven't told her. It might be helpful to bring her to a session. She would never come. You could ask her. No. No fucking way. No. I think it might be good for our relationship. I don't have a problem with our relationship. Do you have a problem with our relationship? No, no. Then we have nothing left to discuss. There is one thing that I was going to tell you. I knew that you liked John. What do you mean? At the beginning, at the rehab place. I could tell that you liked him. But then, I just thought, maybe he liked me. I mean, we had the same sense of humor, we even had the same initials. We used to call each other jj. I never thought that you would ever see him again. I mean, except maybe as my mother. And he was too young for you. Okay, I see. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm a horrible person. No, Jesse, no you're not. You're not. Really? It's just a horrible situation. You can't ever tell anyone, okay? Not Peter, not anybody. Okay, I won't, I won't. I promise. If you do, I'll never speak to you again. I won't. I won't. Do I look dead? You do. I thought that was what you were going for. That is good. Hey. Hi. Happy birthday. Yes, happy birthday. Thank you, thanks. So, are you ready to hike? Yes. Let's go. Um, I'm not going to go. You guys go. What? Are you serious? Come on, Lee. It's beautiful up there. It's not that strenuous. It'll be exhilarating. Yeah, I don't think i'm quite up for exhilarating. But you both go on. I'll see you tonight and we'll celebrate. We'll have cake with sardines. Uh huh. Are you sure you're okay? Yes! Okay. Alright. Okay, so... Fine. I'd like to do one shot of the woman. No, no. It is too dangerous. Could you just ask her, please? Wait. Jesse? Hey, where are you two? It's after 8:30. Hope you're on your way. I think something's happened to her. Maybe she's upset with you. No, Malik, it's not that. We've been getting along fine. Look, are you sure you're not just... I'm not imagining it! Our daughter is missing! Hi, um, it's Lee Johnson for Dr. bloom. Could you just have her call me as soon as possible? Jesse? Are you alright? We got lost. It was so scary. Our phones wouldn't work, and we finally found the trail, but I'm really tired, so I'll just call you in the morning. I'm just glad you're okay. Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine. Okay, goodnight mom. Good night. Where's Peter? He missed his session. Peter wouldn't miss his session. Why do you think you were so frightened last night? Hasn't Jesse come home late before? I thought something bad had happened to her. We were supposed to have dinner together. You said she was hiking and then she got lost? She was with Peter. So she wasn't hiking. She was hiking. I see. What do you mean "I see?" Do you think there's something going on? I didn't say that. Do you think there's something going on? No. No, Peter's not her type. He's way too conservative. Something's wrong. What do you think's wrong? I don't know, but Peter wouldn't miss his session. Do you always anticipate the worst? What? Well, you were worried about Jesse last night. Now you're concerned about Peter. Well, I guess maybe I expect bad things to happen. And they do. All the time. Look, I know you've seen a lot of terrible things in your job, but you're not in a warzone now. I'll try to remember that. Peter? Ms. Johnson? You looking for somebody? This is a nice place. Why are you here? Well, things have gotten a little more complicated. I spoke to your attorney. Nice guy. Did you find anything? Well, we finally got a hold of Jackson's landlord. He said the last time that he saw Jackson was the same night you last saw him? Said he was with some woman out on the road, out in front of the house? The woman hit him, and then shoved him to the ground. And then when they were gone, he walked over and he found, um, he found this laying on the ground. Have you ever seen this before? No. Okay, he said it was dark and he couldn't recognize it, but she looked young. You look young for your age. If it was dark, how did she know it was John? Recognized his truck. Oh, I'm sorry. I have to go. I have a doctor's appointment. I'll keep you informed, okay? Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye. Hi. Who's that guy you were talking to. It's a cop. He was looking for John. Did they find him? No. Jesse? Did you see John again that night after you left? Yeah. I was really fucked up, so I couldn't really drive that well, so I pulled over on the side of the road and he just pulled up next to me. Did anything happen? Did you hit him, or... No. He grabbed my arm and, and I was trying to get away from him, but... Why are you so obsessed with him? Why can't you just think about me once in a while? Okay, I'm going to go. Peter? You've never been a real mom to me. It was so obvious that I liked him. I wish that that fucking bomb had killed you. Hey, hey, look, okay, okay, it's okay. So John, how do you like posing for my mom? I can't believe you did this. I was just out of the hospital. She called, I was lonely. You should've fucking told me. I wanted to, I tried to. Then why the fuck didn't you? I'm going to find Jesse. Stop fucking calling me! Jesse, are you okay? It's none of your fucking business. This is Jesse, leave a message. Jesse, hey it's me. Listen, um, um, I, I need to talk to you in person, so i'm going to come to your studio. I should be there in about an hour. Okay? Call me when you get this. Thanks. Jesse? Malik, it's Lee. Have you seen Jesse? Call me. Hi, it's Peter. Please leave a message after the beep. Peter, it's Lee. Where are you? I'm going to John's. I'm hoping it'll help me remember what really happened that night. John? Peter? Lee. Where are you? I'm at my apartment. Look, I need to talk to you. Some thing, or things, made you drive from Briggs, to your daughter's, then back to Mr. Jackson's? You had me followed from Briggs? No. We followed you from your daughter's how'd you know I was going there? We didn't. We weren't looking for you. We were looking for her. But when you showed up, we thought you might lead US to Jesse. But you lead US back to Mr. Jacksons. I was just looking for anything that would tell me where he was. Then why did you go to your daughter's first? Because I wanted to see her. You think she might know where he was? No, I just wanted to see her. Where'd you find this? I found it under Mr. Jackson's bed. Looked like he was trying to hide it. That's the same piece of jewelry that I showed you before. That's my bracelet, I... I just loaned it to her that- then why'd you tell me you didn't recognize it? I thought it would look bad. I shouldn't have. You're right. You shouldn't have. You know, John and I walked down that road all the time. It probably just fell off. Sergeant Goodman? I'm Peter stone. My client isn't well, and i'm taking her back to the hospital. If you tell me what happened, you're going to feel a lot better. You know, I need to get back to the hospital. We found that under Mr. Jackson's bed. Peter... I think John may be alive. What? I had the guy in my office do a search on John's credit card. The card was used to purchase breakfast three days in a row at the same diner in San Diego. Why didn't you tell Goodman? We don't know anything for sure, yet. I think we should just go down there, and find out if anyone's actually seen John. Um, let me just reach Jesse. She's asleep. She's at my apartment. Is that why you left Briggs so suddenly? Because of you and Jesse? No, I left Briggs because I found out Goodman had evidence against you and I didn't feel like defending another murderer. That's not how you feel. Come on, you're here. Things are okay between US. No, things are not okay. You and Jesse were both fucking John. You don't think I needed to know that? I couldn't tell you. I can't believe I didn't have a fucking clue. I promised Jesse. Well she should've told me. She told me everything else about her life. She's probably afraid you'd run off. Yeah, I should run off. Come on. This is it. I don't recognize him. Well maybe he, you know, cut his beard or trimmed his hair? Nope. Sorry. Thank you. Well, now what? Let's just wait around for a bit maybe, maybe he'll show up. I'm gonna grab a seat. Mm. Thomas? Where's John? I, I don't know. What'd you do to him? I didn't do anything to him. You're using his card. I... Look, Adele kicked me out of the storage unit. I went to John's house. I stayed there a couple of days. I didn't, I didn't know if he was coming back. Like he, he left his wallet. He used to let me borrow his credit cards sometimes. I was going to pay him back. If he ever came back. So you haven't seen him at all? No. Not since he was last at work. Yes, sergeant Goodman please. It's Peter stone. He lived here for a couple months. There are more empty units upstairs. Jesus. Oh, god. Oh, oh. He left you a note. It said that he was sorry. It's my fault. No, it's not your fault. The guy tried to kill himself before you even knew him. The guy was damaged. You didn't know him. Hi. Hey. Sorry I'm late. Not that bad, right? Hey, how are you? Hi mommy. Hi, how are you? I'm doing pretty good. Yeah? You look good. Well, well I guess we'd better get going. Yeah alright, let me take your picture. Okay. Stoic. Okay, we got the stoic. Okay, that's enough I think. Bye sweetie. We'll see you soon. Yes. See you on the outside, huh. Yes. Bye. Thank you. Are you alright with that? Yeah, I got it. They don't look anything alike. I, I can't trust what I'm seeing. I thought I was getting better. You are getting better. You no longer have to see Peter as John. That's great progress. For a while, I even thought that Jesse killed John. I mean, how could I have thought that about her. Lee, you weren't well. You thought you'd killed him. That's different. She couldn't have done it. I could have. It's okay. She didn't want to go, but I insisted. Her name was hawa. It means lucky. Hello? Jesse? Hey mom. Peter, hey! I am starving. Can we eat? I set the table on the roof. Ah, how nice. Why don't you go on up and I'll organize the food. Yeah, I set the table upstairs, okay, cool. I got offered a couple of assignments in the middle east. Oh. I... I thought you wanted to work here. It doesn't feel right anymore, after everything that happened. So you're just going to go back to war? Would you be okay with that? I mean, I don't want you to go. But I know you need to. I'm a war photographer. That's what I do. Look, I wanted to tell both of you, okay, but I couldn't. Trade you her... I can trust what I'm seeing. I thought I was getting better. Lee, I'm not a good guy. It is too dangerous. This might be another fight, you see? I couldn't say no.
