Ciao, Natasha. -Ciao. VLADO: Have a good weekend. Where is it, here? No. Hey, Iook, it's here. Hey, VIado. SIavko. SLAVKO: You make me Iate, huh? BarceIona. Now the weekend begins. Yeah, we're gonna have a great time. You shouId have got that watermeIon, huh? I toId you. I think that's my cue to caII it a day. Just can't seem to keep my hands stiII. I hope your patients don't hear you say that. Okay, back another 25 metres. -Are you kidding? SLAVKO: Yeah, come on. -Miso! MISO: No. So have some bread. What's happening up there? They're shooting oIives. Back here. Twenty-two, -You need some beer. -Twenty-three, 24, 25. No, AmeIa, come on. You got it. -Nadja! -AmeIa! -Maida! -AmeIa! Come. That's too much for you. Come, sit. Eat, eat. What do you think of her? She's coming to BarceIona with me. That's now six you've got coming. Is it six? Mama, do I have to eat the potatoes? Yes. Hey, SIavko. If you're Iooking for someone to take to the OIympics... . VIado, that's not nice. Why don't you ask Natasha if she wants to go? You know, the girI from the traveI agency. -Natasha! -Natasha! Come on, I'm not Iooking for a wife. She's a nice girI. That's what I mean. LEJLA: Natasha! MAIDA: What's going on here? VLADO: I don't know. MAIDA: What are they doing? VLADO: What's going on? You must show me your papers. I don't have to show you anything. SOLDIER: You are now in the Serbian RepubIic of Bosnia. Your papers. Since when? It was decIared by Radovan Karadzic this morning. Don't be ridicuIous. Karadzic has nothing to do with us. Drive on. I must see your ID. Your nationaIity? VLADO: YugosIavian. Good night. Idiot. MAIDA: I can't beIieve these soIdiers. What do they think they are doing? SOLDIER: Get out of the car. SLAVKO: It's okay, I'II deaI with it. Give me the thousand. -You're not giving him money. -Just Iet him deaI with it. SIavko Stanic, Serbian from Banja Luka... ...now Iiving in Sarajevo. These are friends of mine, they're taking me home. I see. I was going to buy some of NapoIeon's best cognac tonight... ...to ceIebrate the news. Why don't you ceIebrate with me? I think I wiII. -Okay, take care, bye. -You too. SLAVKO: Okay, Iet's go. VIado... ...what if Maida and AmeIa had been traveIIing back on their own? I mean, with me, okay, I have my Serbian ID. But two MusIim women on their own with the kids? That's worrying. They'II be gone in the morning. The U.N. can't aIIow that to go on. Huh? MISO: I hope you're right. -Good night, sweetheart. LEJLA: Good night. Are you sure you've got everything... -...for schooI tomorrow? -Yes, Mom. AII right, don't stay up aII night. -I won't. MISO: Night. Be a good girI, LejIa. AMELA: Thank you for the weekend. It's a pIeasure, ciao. I have to put it first in this hand, okay? SLAVKO: Look, it's gone. Wait a minute, where is it? Oh, it's here. No, it's too fast. Come on, music off, Iights out. -Bye. Good night. -Sweet dreams. And no taIking Iate, okay? I'm going to bed. -See you Iater. MAIDA: Night, SIavko. SLAVKO: Night, Maida. Oh, for me? Wow. I had them aII stuffed in a drawer, so I thought... . Where shaII I hang it? VLADO: So young... . VLADO: That was Budapest, right? SLAVKO: Yeah. Six hundred metres, good shooting. I knew you'd have to incIude that one. So why now? Just wanted you to have it. -Let's drink. -Yeah. MAN (ON TV) : When Bosnia 's parliament voted... ...for independence from Yugoslavia... ...Bosnian/Serb leader Radovan Karadzic... ... warned of violent consequences. MAN: Now Bosnia is independent... ...and there's growing concern that violence... ...even open war, could erupt. Fuelled by old ethnic hatreds that are again emerging... ...as Yugoslavia disintegrates. MAN: In Sarajevo, many believed peace would prevail. Muslims, Croats and Serbs have lived comfortably together... ...in the Bosnian capital for decades, forging friendships and intermarrying. But the mountains that ring Sarajevo... ... where the Winter Olympics were held just eight years ago... ...are now controlled by Bosnian/Serb militias with heavy weapons. One kilometre, a kilometre and a half from Sarajevo. But we don 't shoot, we try just to keep peace... ...and not to control the surrounding of Sarajevo. MAN: You could take Sarajevo tomorrow, couldn 't you? Anytime. We could take it anytime. NADJA: AmeIa, what are you doing in there? WOMAN (ON TV) : Bosnian/Serb politicians still talk of peace... ...and they're denying reports that Muslims and Croats... ...are now being forced at gunpoint to leave their villages. No, Mama, I'm trying to find my book. We can 't achieve anything by war. We don 't want to take the other villages... ...or the other towns, or to impose any solution. We just want to be free, to be as independent as the others. WOMAN: But more and more Sarajevans don 't believe... ...Karadzic wants peace. Fearing the worst, they're abandoning their city. Found my book, Dad. Found my book. VLADO: Good. NADJA: You had it. Ready? Bye, Mama. LEJLA: Thank you for having me. MAIDA: Bye-bye. Bye-bye, LejIa, stay whenever you want. NADJA: Bye! MAIDA: Bye! Come on. That'II be 70 deutsche marks. -Think we shouId be Ieaving? -I don't know. I mean, I can't Ieave the hospitaI... ...but maybe I shouId be getting AmeIa and LejIa away. See you Iater. I'm sure that a Iot of what is happening... ...is because peopIe are getting on the bandwagon... ...and creating chaos just to make an easy buck. And it's our fear that they're Iiving off. I think it's important to Iet them know... ...that we wiII not be frightened out of our homes. Yes, I know. But it's not that, Mr. SeIimovic. My boyfriend's Serbian and he's been caIIed up into the army. That's why we want to Ieave. I see. He doesn't want to fight. No, I can understand that. -I'II keep the job for you. -Thank you. Of course. VLADO: My car. Hey! MAN (ON TV) : --abandon your homes or be murdered. VLADO: What can I do? Who can I report it to? Nobody's interested. MAN: In Zvornik, people are fleeing with only the clothes they are wearing. There are reports of young men being murdered or taken hostage. Panic is gripping Sarajevo. VLADO: Look, it's Zijah. Do you know how much he's charging... ...for one can of petroI? Two hundred deutsche marks. MAN: Only way to get petrol is to buy it from the gangs that are running... ... the black market that suddenly developed. -Hey, that's our car! -It can't be. -It is, Iook, seIIing our car on TV! -Come in. Hi. VLADO: WouId you beIieve it? For keeping your husband up Iate Iast night. That is outrageous. That is outrageous, I shouId have taped it. What's happened? Zijah, he stoIe my car this morning. And he's just been seIIing it on TV, just now. MAIDA: Waving your hands and taIking in a high voice isn't gonna bring it back. No point in having a car now anyway. They're not Ietting anyone through the roadbIocks. We got through Iast time, didn't we? It's different now. Have you been caIIed up? Yeah. So, what are you gonna do about it? I go tomorrow. Why? He's been caIIed up. You don't have to join Karadzic's army. There are pIenty of Serbs who are draught dodging. -Miso isn't going. -Miso's a doctor... ...and I wouIdn't want Miso in my army. -What wiII you be doing? -Cadet training. And if they start firing those guns on the hiIIsides... ...where are you gonna be then? Wherever they're not pointing at me. Firing them? He said he's cadet training. I have nothing to do with the artiIIery. Perhaps you shouId have. Then you can teII your commanding officer... ...to take his tanks off our hiIIsides. I don't Iike guns pointing at me! Some idiot might set one off! You can't get sucked into aII this, SIavko. Those guys caIIing themseIves generaIs are madmen. They caII me MusIim, they caII you Serb. We're YugosIav. You have to get out. What they got you doing, huh? Training kids to shoot on us? I can get you three pIane tickets out of the city. You're famiIy to us. You beIong to Sarajevo... ...not those idiots up in the hiIIs Iiving out their stupid history books. How much? What? For the tickets, I can hear. Ten thousand deutsche marks. Ten thousand deutsche marks? Where to, New ZeaIand? Vienna. Ten thousand deutsche marks for Vienna. That's cheap, peopIe are paying twice that price. How much are you getting out of it? -Hey. -Maida, I don't get anything. I just want you to get out of the city. And what the heII wouId we do in Vienna? -Be refugees? -No, no, no. We are not going to be refugees. That is Third WorId stuff. This is Sarajevo, not SomaIia. We're Europeans, for God's sake. You can go on to StockhoIm and stay with Anders and his wife. We can't arrive on Anders' doorstep and say: ''Hi, we're refugees now. We'd Iike to move into your house for the next 20 years. '' MAIDA: VIado has spent 1 5 years buiIding up his business. And I have worked overtime every week of those 1 5 years to Iive the Iife we do. So nobody is going to take it away from us now. The moment we waIk away, we Iose everything. This is our home. I think you shouId Ieave. I'm just trying to warn you, Maida. Listen to me. We don't get our wage untiI-- UnIess we start fighting. A Iot of angry soIdiers, VIado. That's why you shouId take those tickets. You may have everything to Iose, we have nothing to Iose. You know the most important thing in the worId to me... ...is that you, Maida and Nadja are safe. Yeah. I'II see you around. Hey. MAN (ON TV) : Sarajevo is now cut off from the rest of the world. Encircled by Bosnian/Serb machine guns.... If they fire just one of those guns up on the hiIIside... ...they wiII have destroyed themseIves. Just Iike what happened in the GuIf. The Americans wiII come, straight at them. MAN: --but the only response from the Bosnian/Serb leadership today... ... was silence. VLADO: Nadja! You okay? Come on! Get her things. Okay. MAIDA: Shh! Shh! Okay. Come on, Nadja, hop on Daddy's back. Maida! MAIDA: They're stuck in the eIevator! Maida, there's nothing we can do. Come on! VLADO: We shouId make a run for Miso's. No, I don't want to go anywhere. -We can't stay here. -Come on, Iet's go. Stay cIose. Go on. Nadja! Nadja! VLADO: Leave it! Come inside. VLADO: Go on. Listen. They want to frighten us out of our homes, don't they? That's what they're doing. Who are you caIIing? SIavko. I want to find out about those tickets. I think I shouId do that. AMELA: LejIa, never ever go out on your own again. Make sure either me or your dad are with you. -Do you hear? -That goes for you, Nadja. AMELA: Not untiI those tanks are gone. And don't ever use the eIevator. Here, try this on. The Iines are down. WOMAN (ON TV) : From their dominant positions on the hills... ...rising above Sarajevo... ...Bosnian/Serb gunners can precisely target... ...most of the streets and buildings in the city. Snipers are now operating from positions along the frontlines... ...shooting anyone in their sights. And for the people of Sarajevo, there is no escape from a city... ... that's become a shooting gallery. The roads out are closed... ...and the airport is held by Bosnian/Serb forces. They overran it yesterday, using tanks to crush any opposition. Now Sarajevans must either surrender their city... ...or try to defend it. Okay. What's he doing now? VLADO: He wants to controI the bIack market. Start an army. That's what he's doing. Zijah's miIitia. Opportunistic mother... . This is the magazine. This is how you Ioad it. Then you get ready to shoot. Put the safety, aIways be carefuI. NADJA: Dear LejIa... ...my best friend ever in the whoIe worId. This is my first report due from the frontIine. The eIectricity and water are stiII off... ...but Dad's found some useIess pIastic stuff... ...to put across the windows. OId teddy has a cut on his nose... ...but otherwise the SeIimovic famiIy is just fine. Where are you sIeeping? I'm not aIIowed in my bed anymore. And Dad said we're not going down to the basement... ...because things wiII be safer where we are. Great, I hope he's right or we're dead. MALIK: I'm sorry. Where are you going? Young MaIik's out there with a rifIe. He doesn't have a chance. Nadja, come away. VLADO: MaIik, no time for mistakes. Like that. You're going to be on the frontIine in Dobrinja. Chechniks shooting at you. That shouId do it. I'II be aII right, darIing, I wiII. I'II be back, okay? Come here. MAN: Hey, hey. Over here. First house. NEBOJSA: VIado. -Nebojsa! Good Iuck. Thanks. Everyone's in. ZIJAH: Okay. The Serbs are way back... . Back here. No probIem. So Avram, Samir, MaIik and Dusdo, Nevinova street. VLADO: MaIik. ZIJAH: MaIik! Come on, forward for God's sake! MaIik, get forward, you idiot! You have to get forward into the house. MaIik! ZIJAH: VIado, get back into the house! MAN (ON TV) : Sarajevo 's suburbs have become battlegrounds. Civilians are being caught in the crossfire. Here in Dobrinja, the fighting is particularly vicious. It's a predominantly Muslim district next to the Serb-controlled airport. Its streets are now a killing zone. Nine of the 25 men in just one unit defending Dobrinja... ...have died in the last few days. One of the many tragedies of this conflict: -It's turned neighbour against neighbour. -Home Ieave. People who were once friends are killing each other. And the international community appears powerless. -Nadja. -Thank you. -HeIIo. -VIado, how are you? SIavko. I tried caIIing you. How are Maida and Nadja? Yeah, they're here, they're fine. Good, I'm reaIIy gIad to hear that. -Where are you? -WeII out of it. Where? I toId you to take those tickets. Yeah, yeah, you were right. I can stiII get you out. May be your last chance, Vlado. You've got to take it this time. -Go on. -Go and see Natasha. You know Natasha from the traveI agency. Yeah, of course I know her. I've given her detaiIs of a route you can take. And a speciaI pass to get you through the checkpoint. It's totaIIy safe, but you have to go today. Vasa SIava street, C bIock, 340. You got that, 340. Vasa SIava street. Lieutenant Stanic, sir. SLAVKO: God's sake, VIado, you go this time! Okay, okay, I'II come. Promise me now. You get the heII out of there. You shouId take Nadja and go. MAIDA: On our own? I can't Ieave now, I'm needed here. Cross the mountains on our own? -What if it's a trap? -He wouIdn't do that to us. He wants you to be safe. I'm not going anywhere without you. No, and I'm not going to go anywhere without LejIa. We stay together, VIado. OFFICER: Okay, Iet's see what we have. SLAVKO: Good shooting. Good. What are you trying to do, shoot his thing off? Come here, I'II show you. OFFICER: Okay, you're now trained snipers. Tomorrow, you'II be going to the frontIine in Sarajevo. SLAVKO: One. Two. And out. Men, women, chiIdren. If you keep a IittIe breath inside you to keep you stiII... ...then you wiII become one with your target. OFFICER: You see a target, you fire. The job is to terrorize, okay? -Is that cIear? ALL: Yes, sir. I'd rather my team didn't shoot in AIipasino PoIje. Why, you have friends there? We aII have friends there. But we are Serbs. We are fighting for our famiIies. We are shooting for everything and everyone we have Iost. For aII our suffering. Meet SIavko Stanic, the best shooter in YugosIavia. Tomorrow his boys wiII show us what they can do in Sarajevo. NADJA: Hi. AMELA: Happy birthday. -Happy birthday. -ChocoIate. MAIDA: Hi. MISO: HeIIo. MAIDA: Good to see you. So how does it feeI to be a teenager? MAIDA: She hates being caIIed that. VLADO: Come on in. AMELA: Look, this is great. You guys want beer? Oh, fantastic. -You guys want beer? -Sure. Nadja, can you put this on the piano, pIease? Thank you. Where did you get aII this stuff? -Don't ask. -How much did it cost... ...that's the question. VLADO: You have to ceIebrate a birthday. MAIDA: And now, our pi?ce de r?sistance. Pizza! Oh, thank you, Mama. One with tuna and one pepperoni speciaI. AMELA: Look at that, LejIa. Maida, you want a beer? Eat, everybody. Yeah, come on, go for it. So have you heard from SIavko? Yeah, he caIIed. In fact, he offered us an escape route. Escape route? What sort of escape route? Yeah, a route out of the city. Said he had some friends on a checkpoint. -Nadja. -Thank you, Dad. MISO: So when are you going? -Pizza, pizza for you. No, no, we didn't take it. It was just for that day. Are you crazy? Why the heII not? We have dying peopIe dumped in the corridors... ...of the hospitaI every day and we can't treat them. This is onIy the beginning. VIado did teII us we shouId Ieave. It was me who said no, I wanted us to stay together. MISO: Of course you did. But VIado shouId have said, ''Thank you, but go. '' For God's sake, VIado, we're taIking about survivaI here. If anything happens to any of us-- -You know what I'm taIking about. -Miso-- MISO: Nothing matters more than survivaI. You want to survive, you have to fight for it. That's why I have to stay. Sure, but Nadja doesn't, Maida doesn't. What reason on earth couId there be for keeping them here? You couId have taken my car. You couId have taken AmeIa and LejIa with you. I wouId give anything to get them out! Anything! I'm sorry. Let's cheer the birthday girI. Thank you. ALL: Cheers. ZIJAH: Hey! How much does it cost an hour for a woman? My friend's getting desperate over here. MAN: For MusIims, 1 00 deutsche marks! ZIJAH: Then teII your sister I owe her 50! You maniac, what are you trying to do, kiII me? HeIIo, best friend ever.

AMELA: Wait for me, LejIa. -Come on. Can we stop at Nadja's on the way? No, I want to come back and do the Iaundry. LEJLA: But I want to give her the tape. Oh, the battery's not run out on that thing yet? -Where are the wheeIs? -Oh, I forgot. WouId you go back...? It doesn't matter, I'II get them. -Wait here. -Yes. AMELA: Oh, come on, where is it? LejIa, have you seen the cart? LEJLA: No, Mom! -You had it Iast. HeIIo, best friend ever. As I was saying... ...I spend haIf my Iife waiting for my mother... ...and here I am waiting for her again.

No, I don't want him to know. WOMAN: He'II have to know, AmeIa. There's a sniper in the empty buiIding at the far end. That's what's happened. They must have taken the buiIding. She'II be aII right. She's going to be aII right. VIado. Get that, get that! Maida just caIIed me. WiII you pIease get out of here? Yeah. Oh, Miso, I'm so sorry. Just get out of here. I don't ever wanna see you again. They can't bury her at the cemetery. Why not? It's fuII. And no one wiII go to Bara because of the snipers. I'm not staying here to see my daughter murdered. Where are you going? MAIDA: Across the city. An apartment in Kosovo. It beIongs to a coupIe who have Ieft... ...so we can use it untiI the end of the war. LEJLA (ON TAPE) : Hello, best friend ever. Me again. Miso got it for AmeIa and LejIa... ...but now AmeIa wants to be near the grave. He found it for them the morning she was shot. Now, why do you have to teII me that? I'm just teIIing you that he's managed-- No you're not! WiII you stop pIaying that freaking tape?! MAIDA: She can pIay it if she wants to! You're onIy teIIing me that because that's what I shouId have done. No, I'm not. He heard about it-- And he is onIy doing this now to show me up. Do you think showing you up... ...is on his mind the day he's buried his daughter? -Every time you get it wrong! -Oh, what do I get wrong? Miso understood the situation aII aIong... ...right from the beginning, and you never did! You were bIind! And who toId you to take that route out when SIavko phoned? It was too Iate by then. -Oh, Miso didn't think so. -How couId I Ieave you... ...when you are on the frontIine? WeII, you're Ieaving me now! If you can't see why I'm going now... . No, I do. Go, go, do it. Sod off. Yes, I wiII. What a good man he is, huh? What humiIity on the day he's burying his own daughter... ...to think of you and Nadja! -Yes, he is a good man. -I mean it! How the heII can he stiII be a good man? NADJA: Go away. VLADO: Nadja. -Go away, Ieave me aIone! How are your boys doing in Sarajevo? They're okay. You've got to keep on eye on them. SLAVKO: Don't worry, I'II keep them sharp. OFFICER: This is easy. We can bomb every MusIim's house in Bosnia... ...but there'II be no Serbia... ...unIess we take Sarajevo. So which house you want? Pick any house. We'II save one for you. Hey, hey. Stop, stop, back, back up. OFFICER: Say goodbye. What happened to my famiIy was 1 0 times worse than this. OFFICER: Get them out of here. To aII our famiIies. -I'II take this house. -Of course. OFFICER: Okay, we Ieave this house! Let's go! We have more snipers. They are targeting the apartment-- What are you teIIing me for? -To do something about it. -Why? Are your saIes going down? Everybody in the estate has to use the streets... ...sometime during the week. And aII the victims are peopIe going to the water truck. Is this it? Okay. What eIse do you need? VLADO: There's no one shooting at us from inside the estate. They've got to be in those buiIdings over there. You're Iooking for anything. Any change in Iight, a shadow... ...cigarette smoke, anything. MAN: Okay. They've got to be there somewhere. Nothing. OT) Get forward! Stop! Stay here. She's moving. Dino, bring that car over here! You have to be seeing at Ieast one of them. We're not seeing anything. ZIJAH: Get them into the car. You find these murderers, VIado. Do you know where Dr. Kovacevic is? I reaIIy don't know, sir. VLADO: Miso. I need your heIp. The bodies of two women shot in the head... ...in AIipasino PoIje were brought in this afternoon. Can you give me an autopsy? Give you an autopsy? Who do you think you are? I need to find out from where they were shot. MISO: Do you think we have time for autopsies? Miso, pIease. Any information, anything. Look, I'm doing what I can. You have to wait in reception Iike everyone eIse. MaIik! How are you? MALIK: VIado, hi. I am okay. Thanks. MAN: GirI, 1 3. Mr. SeIimovic? Mr. SeIimovic? -Mr. SeIimovic? -Yeah. PIease foIIow me. MISO: Okay, the buIIet entered the front of the cranium here. There is a cIean hoIe in the outer Iayer... ...and there is shattering on the inner Iayer... ...but it got no further than the brain. The diameter of the wound-- WouIdn't the buIIet normaIIy pass through the head? Don't you know that? You're the one who does the shooting. Aside from which part of the body you are hitting... ...I wouId have thought it depends on the distance the buIIet traveIs. The buIIet passed through LejIa's head. If that information is of any use to you. Therefore, I wouId surmise... ...that this buIIet was at the end of its trajectory. Therefore shot from a Iong distance. You've had your two minutes. -The buIIet. -What? That kiIIed her. That's five, 600 metres away. Shooting through buiIdings. Everyone kiIIed has been shot in the head. It's not possibIe. I couIdn't do it, but it's possibIe. Can't you get at him from here? I onIy get one chance. If I miss, he'II move. That's another 1 5 days Iooking for him. You see that bus on the Serb's side? Now, if I get positioned behind that... ...I can reach him going into the buiIding at the back. The onIy way to get behind that bus is crossing the road. We go under the road. I was wrong. I couIdn't get an angIe on him. -Is Natasha here? -No. -Where is she? -She doesn't Iive here. I know she Iives here. I don't know who you mean. -Where is she? -PIease, I don't know. Freaking Iiar. Freaking Iiar, where is she? PIease, I don't know. TeII me one more time that you don't know her... ...and I wiII take you to Zijah and I wiII teII him you're an informer. PIease, no. Now, you teII me the truth, and you'II be okay. So is she your girIfriend? She's my sister. Go on, take it. Do you know SIavko Stanic? Did SIavko invite Natasha to go with him to BarceIona? To the OIympics? He did, didn't he? I hoped he wouId. We were aII going together. My wife, my daughter... ...SIavko, your sister. Is she with him now? SIavko is as a brother to me. He means as much to me as Natasha does to you. What do you want me to do? I have to go and see them. It's impossibIe. You just teII me where they're Iiving. They're up in the hiIIs, across IIidza. It's impossibIe to go there now. Draw me a map. WeII, how about that? Come on in! Oh, I was hoping you'd make it. Come in, come in. How did you know I was coming? Natasha's brother caIIed on the CB. If you had caIIed me yourseIf... ...I wouId have toId those boys on the hiII... ...to hoId firing untiI you were over. Come in. Natasha. Get some water and a toweI for our guest. Give me that. Come in. Here she is. Isn't she beautifuI? -Hi. -Hi. Thanks. Why have you come here? To drink, to taIk. Hm? -Is that true? -Yeah. SLAVKO: Of course it's true. We've never been apart for so Iong. So, what are you having to drink? Cognac, whisky, beer, gin? What do you want? Anything you want. -Nothing for me. SLAVKO: Of course you're drinking. Not tonight. You're my guest now, and tonight we're drinking. Natasha, whisky and ice for my very best friend. And the oIives. Why didn't you shoot me up on the hiII? -Why didn't you shoot me? -When? Just now. Isn't that why you're here? To kiII me? That's your job, isn't it? Since your factory cIosed, your new job? Come on, we shouId be ceIebrating. Game of chess. Sweetheart, Iet's have the chessboard. Whose turn to start? Okay, you're white. I'm going to bed. If you're staying, I'II see you in the morning. Yeah, good night. Good night, sweetheart. See you Iater. I've never met a girI Iike her before. Someone who dreams the same as me. I don't have to expIain things to her, the way I feeI, the way I think. She Ioves me. And I teII you, VIado, I'm crazy about her. This is not me pIaying games here. The first time I've ever feIt right with the worId. So we finaIIy made it to the OIympics. You're kiIIing women and chiIdren on your own streets. This is war. You know, you were up on that hiII Iike a IittIe rabbit. A sitting target. I couId have had you just Iike that. But you know I'd never kiII you. Do you remember that night in Odessa... ...after we won the pairs? Yeah, down on the beach. It was a bottIe of this. I want you to Ieave with Natasha tonight. We never did find out who took our cIothes. -You're not Iistening to me. -I heard you. SIavko, you've got to stop. Fifty years ago my famiIy was taken from their home... ...a house Iike this, by Croats and MusIim fascists. Yeah, I know what happened. We aII know what happened. But didn't we Iearn anything together? We were friends. How can you find happiness... ...when you're shooting on your own peopIe? I've got my happiness now. LejIa is dead. You know that? Yeah, she was shot in the head by a sniper. That wasn't me. Whoever he was, he was trained by you. SLAVKO: Natasha? Natasha? Pack everything we can get in the jeep. -We're Ieaving tonight. -Why? SLAVKO: Don't ask. NATASHA: Where are we going? SLAVKO: Just do it, we're going away. I've been wondering how you've been doing... -...these Iast weeks. -Worried? Huh? Of course. You've spent a Iifetime worrying about me. Where wiII you go? You can stop worrying from now on. We're finished, VIado. No, I want you to caII me and you Iet me know where you are. -You do that, pIease. -You said it yourseIf, it's too Iate. I hate anything to end. I know you do. I've had a Iot of tired days because of that... ...over the years. It's been worth it, though. -You go inside, yeah? -Okay. NATASHA: SIavko! No! No! Fatigues, fIak jacket, buIIet-proof vest. It's aII IsraeIi. We get what we can find. Brandy, two bottIes, French. So you got him. WeII done. Yes, sir? Can we heIp you? What's going on? We've decided to come to work. There hasn't been any post for two months. What are you taIking about? This is our job. If we want to come to work, then we wiII come to work. And no one's gonna stop us. How did you get here? -WaIked. VLADO: From Kosovo? Yes. So, what time do you finish? Three o'cIock. Are you trying to chat me up? I'II come outside. -Are you aII right? -Yeah. I saw AmeIa Iast night. They're gonna give LejIa a proper buriaI... ...when they get the chance. She said Miso wants you to be there. HeIIo, best friend ever. I went in the morning to get water. There was shooting by the water truck... ...but no one was hurt. ZeIjko was crying when I toId him about you. So you see, he didn't hate you. That's aII I can think of today. I'II be better tomorrow.
