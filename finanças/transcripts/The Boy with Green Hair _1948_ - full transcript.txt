. . # There was a boy # A very strange enchanted boy # They say he wandered very far # Very far # Over land and sea # A little shy # And sad of eye # But very wise # Was he # Very, very, very wise # And then one day # A magic day # He passed my way # And while we spoke # Of many things, fools and kings # This he said to me # The greatest thing # You'll ever learn # Is just to love # And be loved in return # The greatest thing # You'll ever learn # Is just to love # And be loved # In return. # All we want to know is your name. Just your name. I tell people my name a hundred times a day. There's nothing to it. Look. Go ahead, ask me my name. What's your name? George Busby. See? That's all there is to it. Now... ...what's your name? If you'll just tell us what town you're from. If you'll just tell us what school you go to. Are you hungry, son? Maybe he wants a lawyer before he'll talk. Or even eat. You're just in time. Picked him up a couple of hours ago. He must be from a neighbouring town because we made a local check. He's not from here. This is all the identification he carried. Evening, doc. This id Doctor Evans. This is mister nobody who lives no place, doesn't go to school, has no mother and father, nobody at all. Thanks, boys. You're welcome. Would you mind sitting here? I'd like to get the bench clear. I hope you'll excuse me but I didn't have time for supper and I'm starved. Chocolate malted milk. I'm sure I asked for strawberry. Oh, well. With or without? With or without what? Onions. With, please. What happened to your hair? I'm not a policeman, I'm a doctor. What kind of a doctor? A regular doctor. As a matter of fact, kind of an expert on boys. What happened to your hair? I cut it off. How? Barber. Why? It's a long story. I like long stories. You wouldn't believe it. I like long stories that are hard to believe. I used to have regular hair. They didn't have to stay there. They could have come back. Then there wouldn't have been any letter and... Ah, ah. What letter? There was this letter. Every time I went to live at a new place I had to take it along to show it to people. Like the time I went to live with Gramp. He put it in a book and I tore it. Just a minute. If you're going to tell me this you'll have to tell it so I can understand it. Begin at the beginning. The very beginning? Why not? OK, then. I was born. Do we have to go back that far? It started then. OK. It's hard to remember. But I remember... ..I remember a big five-layer chocolate cake with white frosting and mummy said, 'Blow.' And I blew. Then I cried 'cause all the candles went out. Halloween was scary but it sure was fun. Thanksgiving I sat on some big books so I could reach the table. Father carved the turkey but mother always said he didn't do it very well. Even when I woke up so early Christmas morning that it was still last night mother and father would open the doors and there would be our Christmas tree. That Christmas I got a flexible flyer and a dog. But then I remember it got to be summer and they'd been gone a long, long time. And then the telegram came. Of course, I know now the telegram was about my mother and father. They were war casualties. I couldn't stay long with aunt Lilian. She said she just wasn't equipped for children. Then I went to stay with cousin Clark and cousin Isabel. But they travelled all the time. Aunt Mary was nice. Aunt Mary would have kept me only uncle Jim got out of work. Aunt Phoebe and aunt Gertrude... Gee, I bet I have more aunts and uncles than anybody in the whole world. They said the city was no place for a child. Then my other uncle had me. Aunt Ellen got very sick. They had to sell her house and go away. What's the matter? Nothing. I was just thinking. I sure lived in a lot of places. Then I went to live with Gramp. Gramp? Your grandfather? No. He's not even my real grandfather. But he likes me to call him Gramp. He's a very famous man. He used to be in show business. Show business, eh? An actor? Yeah. What kind of an actor, a serious actor or a funny actor? A very famous actor. I remember he told me about a time in Europe when he met a king. A real king? Yes, sir. He was in his dressing room and the king came right in. Oh, Gramps, the night was simply wonderful. You gave a swell show. I'm glad you liked it, king. I'm glad you liked it. I wonder if you'd drop over to my palace next Saturday night and do a few numbers for me. I'm having some kings and queens over and a couple of princes, too. I'm sorry, king, I'm all booked up for Saturday. Oh, my. I'll tell you what I'll do, I've been rehearsing a new number and I'll come over two weeks from Saturday. Splendid. Mm? Two weeks? Oh, Gramps, just between you and me, if it isn't asking too much, I wonder if you could do the number for me right now. Mm? Well, I don't usually... Oh, now, now, now. For you, king, I'll do it. Thank you. That's swell of you. Right. # I learned my reading and writing # Ballyraggan Where I went to school # T'was there that I first learned me fighting # From the schoolmaster Mickey O'Toole # He and I had many a scrimmage # And devil a lesson I wrote # If you're in for a wee bit Of action # Just tread on the tail Of my coat # Tread on the tail of my coat # Tread on the tail of my coat # If you're in for a wee bit Of action # Just tread on the tail of my coat # A bogtrotter Mickey Mulvaney # I knew him. # Tried to steal my best girl away # He had money and I hadn't any # Poor lad. # So a challenge I set him Next day # Good. # We fought on the plains Of Kilohaili # And the Shannon I crossed in a boat # Brave lad. # I lathered him with my shillelagh # 'Cause he trod on the tail Of my coat # Tread on the tail of my coat # BOTH: Ha-ha. # Tread on the tail of my coat # If you're in for a row Or a ruction # Just tread on the tail Of my coat. # Anyway, that's what Gramp told me. Gramps sounds OK. Mm. Anyway, I went to live with Gramp. I gave him the letter, the one I was telling you about. I can carry it. Lights. I think you better tell me what rooms I'm not to go in and what I'm not to touch. This is your home, laddie. There's not a room in the house you're not to go in to. In the whole house? What there is of it. As for touching things, there's not a single object in the whole house not made especially for handling. Now, then... How long will I stay? As long as you like, lad. As long as you like. If you just forget your bag for a minute. Just for a minute. I'll conduct you on a grand tour of the house. First, the kitchen. Ah, I've been meaning to get that vase out of people's way. I did it on purpose. I know what you mean, laddie. Gramp. Aye, lad? I think I'll stay. That's fine. That's fine. That's until my mother and father get back. Will you write to cousin Mary and tell her to tell my mother and father where I am. They still think I'm with her. Will you? I mean, send a letter. I will, laddie. Come on now, Peter, I'll show you your room. Did she die? She died. Gee. I didn't think they ever fell. They fall. Then what did you do? Then I came to America. All alone? All alone. (Fighter plane roars by) It's just the evening mail plane. Must be carrying a heavy load of mail tonight. He's going to be alright. (Hums softly) You're not afraid of being alone, are you? Me? No. I'm not afraid of being alone. I was alone for three days once, in a cave, with a tiger. You don't say. What happened? This tiger got loose from a circus and I was in the cave and it was a black tiger. I could hardly get out. I was there. I had a terrible time getting out of that cave. That's what can happen when you get mixed up with a tiger. That's what can happen when you get mixed up with a tiger. Sure can. I'm glad to know about that, Peter. 'Cause anyone mixed up with a tiger wouldn't be afraid to stay home alone. Of course, if you've got any... I'm not afraid of being alone. Of course, if you've got any... I'm not afraid of being alone. That's fine, laddie, 'cause I'm a singing waiter. What's a singing waiter? Well, I'll tell you, an ordinary waiter brings you your food but a singing waiter gives you a bit of song with your meal like - but a singing waiter gives you a bit of song with your meal like - # Oh, Genevieve Sweet Genevieve # Oh, Genevieve Sweet Genevieve # The days may come And the days may go. # See? Gee. It's a grand profession. Of course it requires working evenings so I'll be out. You mean, I'll be left alone? Just me in this whole dark house? Don't be saying dark like it was something bad. I remember the time back home in Ireland when we voted to abolish the dark entirely. You know what happened? What? It was abolished. It was terrible. There we were not knowing night from day, up from down. There we were not knowing night from day, up from down. We didn't know when to sleep, when to get up, when to work or when to play. We were falling on our feet. What did you do? We signed a petition. We brought the dark back to its rightful place. So don't be saying anything against the dark. So don't be saying anything against the dark. It's a grand thing. Especially at night. I don't mind it. Except when I'm alone. Ah, so that's it, is it? Ah, so that's it, is it? I'll tell you a secret. There's nothing in the dark that wasn't there when the light was on. Nothing at all. OK, Gramp. I'm not afraid. Good night, Peter. Good night, Gramp. There's nothing in the dark that wasn't there when the light was on. There's nothing in the dark that wasn't there when the light was on. Morning, Mr Davis. Morning, Mr Fry. My grandson, starting school this morning. Fine looking boy. Let me give you some good advice, young man. Study hard. Wish I'd studied hard. Yes, sir. You can be anything you want to be if you study hard. You can be anything you want to be if you study hard. What do you want to be when you grow up? A milkman. My grandson's starting school this morning. Nice looking boy. Morning. Morning. My grandson, starting school this morning. My grandson, starting school this morning. Fine looking boy. Nice head of hair. We'll be in one of these days when he gets a haircut. Any time, Mr Fry. Any time. Good morning, Mr Fry. Morning. My grandson, starting school this morning. Hello. If you ask me I'd much sooner go fishing on a day like this. Hello again. Fine looking boy. Throw that away now, Peter. That's a grand looking school. Gramp, I didn't tell you about it, but the last school I went to the teacher hit me with a stick. but the last school I went to the teacher hit me with a stick. I big fat stick. A big fat stick, you say? Yeah, with nails in it. Not very big nails, sort of medium sized nails. There's nothing like that in this school, lad. I sure was scared that day. Course, Gramp was right. Miss Brand, our teacher, never hit anybody in her life. She's pretty. About the prettiest lady I ever saw. Jack. OK, you. Come on. Hey, you want to play? Me? I don't care. OK, I take you. And after that, boy, I was really living. Gramp, bought me a bicycle. It was a very famous bicycle. Gramp told me he bought it from a famous Belgian who was a six-day bicycle rider. With it I got a job delivering groceries and earned my own money. # ...going round # The shamrock is... # (Mumbles) Cead mile failte, lad. What's that mean? In Irish that's a hundred thousand welcomes. Let's open it and see how much I got. I wouldn't do that, lad. Money has a way of disappearing. I'll show you. Watch. Keep your eye on it. Are you watching? Can you make more come back than you started with? I don't know. I haven't tried. Staying all by myself didn't bother me any more. I wasn't even afraid of the dark. I didn't even have to take the baseball bat to bed with me when I was by myself. Course, I kept it alongside the bed. Yep, I was just beginning to think Gramp and me would work out OK. At school we were having a war orphan drive. Gramp borrowed a car at the place where I worked to help us collect clothes to send to the war orphans. He took me and some other kids around the neighbourhood to gather more clothes. # Chip, chip, my little horse # Chip, chip again, sir # How many miles to Dublin town? # 4 score and 10, sir # Chip, chip, my little horse # Chip, chip again, sir # Can I get there by candlelight? # You can and back again, sir # Chip, chip, my little horse ALL: # Chip, chip again, sir # How many miles to Dublin town? # 4 score and 10, sir # Chip, chip, my little horse # Chip, chip again, sir # Can I get there by candlelight? # You can and back again, sir # Chip, chip, my little horse # Chip, chip again, sir # How many miles to Dublin town? # 4 score and 10, sir # Chip, chip, my little horse # Chip, chip again, sir # Can I get there by candlelight? # You can and back again, sir. # Peter, you been sitting on my coat. My rabbit is destroyed. Peter, you been sitting on my coat. My rabbit is destroyed. Alright, take care of him for me. He looks like you. He looks like you. He doesn't look like me. Yes, he does. He's a war orphan. You're a war orphan, too. I am not. Yes, you are. We asked miss Brand where your mother and father was. She told us they were killed in the war. That's a lie. You are, too, a war orphan. You're a liar. Your mother and father were killed in the war, that makes you a war orphan. You're a liar. There, now. What is this? Did you? Did I what, Peter? Did you say my mother and father were killed in the war? Did you? You'll feel better if you wash your face before you go back in the classroom. Let's go in to the office. I want to know now. No, lad. It's no fault of miss Brand's at all. No, lad. It's no fault of miss Brand's at all. You should have been told a long time ago. You should have been told a long time ago. It's myself should have told you the first day you came. It's myself should have told you the first day you came. But I just wanted to wait until we got a little better acquainted. Your mother and father are dead. They were killed in London. You should be proud, lad. Proud. They could have got out. They stayed behind. They stayed behind and died. Trying to save other little boys and girls. Trying to save other little boys and girls. Like yourself, and like them. I should have told you sooner. I should have. I should have told you sooner. I should have. I knew all along my mother and father were dead. I knew all along my mother and father were dead. I was just pretending they were away on a trip. But I knew. Sure you did. Of course, lad. You knew all the time. And that letter you been carrying around with you, And that letter you been carrying around with you, written by your own dear father before he died. You'll be reading it one of these days. Well, I best return the automobile or Gallagher will have my head. Would you like to come with me? I got to stay in school. Oh. Oh. I guess you're right. I guess you're right. Well... ..I must be off. I'll see you later, at home. Miss Brand, miss Brand, are they real children or are they made up? They're real. Will the children in the posters will get the clothes we send? They or other children just like them. Do you think they'll like the clothes? They need the clothes. They'll like them. If they could speak to you, they would tell you how much these clothes mean to them. They'd say, 'Thank you for remembering us.' Just look at these headlines. War, war, war. Peter, you're just in time to help me with Mrs Hammond's order. Yes, sir. My boy's still stationed over there. One can of pork and beans. Did you see what Robert Wilson said in his column today? He says unless we're prepared there's no way of avoiding it. One can of pork and beans, Peter. Scientists say we'll be blown to bits in the next one. I don't know what the world's coming to. Seems like it's human nature to want to kill. If it's human nature to kill, all the more reason to be ready in case the other fella starts something. Sophie, if that's human nature we better change it. or there won't be anything human left to change. Nobody wants war. Whatever it is we have to face we'd better be ready. We better be ready in our thinking too, Mary. Not just with our bombs. I say we ought to stop thinking about fighting each other I say we ought to stop thinking about fighting each other and think about understanding each other. That means all of us. When everybody all over the world talks about nothing but war what do you think we'll get? War. Right now we better talk about being prepared so we'll have time to talk about peace and understanding. People say another war means the end of the world. War will come, want it or not. The only question is when. Just in time to get more youngsters like Peter. Gramp, the world isn't going to be blown up and everybody killed. Is it, Gramp? Many's the time I thought it might, lad. Especially on a night like this. When everything is thin and looking sorry and grey like, When everything is thin and looking sorry and grey like, that's why I keep a bit of green about always. that's why I keep a bit of green about always. It was Eileen's teaching, it was. She couldn't stand being without a plant or a bit of evergreen about. It kept her mindful, she'd say, on a lonely night that spring would come. I can remember how'd she'd turn to me, looking all mystical and sweet, and she'd say, 'The wind don't know what I know. 'Stamping about like an mad old bull scaring people to an early grave. 'The wind don't know that spring will come again. 'But I know. 'I know.' Yes, the bit of green helped her, it did. Yes, the bit of green helped her, it did. It's the colour of spring. It's the colour of spring. It meant hope and a promise of new life. (Wind howls) Oh, hush up, wind. Hush up. You don't fool me, either. Hush up. You don't fool me, either. Believe me, laddie, no matter what people say at the time the world will keep on going for a long, long while. the world will keep on going for a long, long while. And do you know what, me bucko? I forgot with all my blathering to tell you the most special and best thing of all. There'll be a grand surprise for you in the morning. It's the way Gramp was. Trying so hard to take your mind off things with surprises. But I just had a feeling something terrible was going to happen. And it did, alright. The very next morning. I was taking a bath and that's when it happened. Oh, well. What's the use? You wouldn't believe it anyway. Oh, well. What's the use? You wouldn't believe it anyway. Well, what was it that happened? It's no use. You won't believe me. I said I would. Sure you did. Grown-ups say a lot of things. Sure you did. Grown-ups say a lot of things. Now, look, you've eaten my hamburger and drunk my milkshake. If you think you're not going to tell me what happened you're crazy. You supposed to be an expert on boys? You're right. Alright. Don't tell me a thing. I'm not even slightly interested. In fact, I probably wouldn't listen. OK. Where was I? You were taking your bath. Oh, yeah. I was taking my bath and doing a good job, too. I didn't want Gramp to come in and say, 'Don't be sparing the soap, lad. 'The shortage is over. 'Under the chin, man, under the chin. 'The ears, man, and behind the ears.' I wasn't expecting anything. Hey, Gramp. Aye, lad? I've got green hair. You've what, lad? Green hair. That's nice. Hurry up and get dressed now, lad. Boy, some surprise. Gramp, how many other people in the world have green hair? Not another single one. Alright, breakfast, lad, breakfast. Come on. We've been in an uncommon amount of dallying. It's not every day your hair turns green. No, it's not at that, lad. (Bottles clink) That'll be the milkman. I'll get it. Morning. Morning, Peter. Let's see. This is Thursday. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. One quart of milk and one pint of cream. Hi, Peter. Hi. What happened to your hair? No cream today. It turned green during the night. Just one quart of milk, then, huh? That's right. Just one. Pretty good, huh? Oh, yes. I think it's super. (Loud crashing and breaking glass) What was that? I think the milkman just fell down the stairs. What have you done to your hair, lad? It turned green. All by itself? All by itself. You've gone and died it. U-uh. How you feeling, lad? Fine. No other symptoms? Pains in your stomach, burning sensations, fever or anything? I feel fine. Maybe you better change it back, Gramp. Change it back? To the way it was. This is the surprise you promised me, isn't it? No, lad. No. This is the surprise I planned for you. Gee, thanks, Gramp. It's just what I always wanted. Gramp, please make it go away. Maybe it'll go away itself. I don't want green hair. I want my own colour back. Now, now. Let's not be too hasty, lad. It's a grand colour. Why are you always ready to think the worst? Maybe it's something good. Something good? Well, like a mark or something. A medal, maybe. What would I get a medal for? I haven't done anything. That's perfectly true. You haven't done anything, anything at all. But you're still young. You're still young, and maybe this medal is for something you're going to do. But what is it I'm going to do? That remains to be seen. But it'll be very interesting to find out. And mark my words it will be something grand. Do you really think so, Gramp? I do, lad. I do indeed. Come on, now. Eat your breakfast. Fall to, lad. Peter, I was thinking, maybe we ought to pay a visit to Dr Knudson this morning. What for? Well, just to make sure it's a grand thing to have green hair and we'd have nothing to worry about. # Oh, the people came from here There # To see the boy with The bright green hair. # Hey, Peter. Look at Peter. Show them your hair, Peter. What do they want to see my hair for? They just want to. Please. (All gasp) Golly. See what I told you? Isn't it super? Super. Come on. We're going to be late for school. Bye, Peter. See you later. # Chip, chip, my little horse Chip, chip again, sir... # And what about the lad? He has green hair. There's nothing wrong with him? Nothing that I can find. I've given him every test I can think of. Is there any medicine, something that will make my hair come back the way it was? Nothing that I know of. Doctor, have you ever had a case like this before? No, and I don't know of anyone else who has, either. He's making medical history. Peter, you are making medical history. Yes, sir. But I'd rather have my hair back the way it was. It isn't everyone who has the chance to make medical history. It'll do no injury? I don't think so. But I don't know. I want my hair back the way it was. Maybe we can dye it back? You mean paint it? Like ladies do? No one's going to paint my hair. I want it the way it was. You can always cut it off. All of it? Mm-mm. No one's going to cut my hair off. I want it the way it was. I want to be like everybody else. Well, I'm sorry. I won't go to school with green hair. But, laddie... Dr Knudson, maybe if he stayed home for a while. Maybe the green hair will go away? Perhaps. Alright. That's what we'll do, then. Who knows? By the morning you might have your own colour back. I'm not going to cut it off and I'm not going to paint it. I want it the way it was. Alright. Let's go home. See what'll happen by tomorrow morning. Don't you worry about this, Peter. There's nothing the matter with you. No, sir. Nothing. Except I've got green hair. (Kids play outside) Peter, lad. Watch closely now. Watch closely. You can't stay couped up here forever, lad. I know. It'll be nothing at all. I'll walk with you to school myself. After the first few minutes they won't pay the least bit of attention to you. You know what it's like? It's like once I had a patch in the seat of my trousers. I was afraid to walk down the street. You know what the truth was? People hardly noticed it at all. OK, Gramp. (Dog barks) We were just talking about the new tax bill. Were you now, indeed? Well, in reference to the new tax bill the lad did not dye his hair green. There's nothing he ate or drank or caught. If you have any questions ask. He didn't dye it? That's what I said. You've heard of people's hair turning green overnight? The lad's turned green. Not contagious? You think it's the milk? The milk. People have been drinking our milk for years. More likely the water. The water. I have been in charge of the water supply... It's not the water. It's not the milk, either. The lad's in fine health. It's not contagious. Well, well, well. Well, well, well what? Well, nothing, I guess. Nothing, he says. Sure. You been thinking it's a strange that happened. You're not sure you're going to like it. Perhaps something ought to be done. It is a little peculiar. Very strange. Strange, indeed. Let me tell you this, my grandson's hair turned green just as natural as the sun comes up in the morning. If it goes it'll go the same way. Right, laddie? I guess so. You bet. Alright. Come on, Peter. Pardon me. It's enough to make one's blood boil. Don't like it indeed. The doctor said it will make medical history. Peter, now I'm sure there's a grand reason for your green hair. I'm sure it's a reason that'll make us all proud. Right? Sure. But, Gramp... Aye, laddie? If it wants to go away all by itself, we won't try and stop it, will we? Well... Hi, Peter. Peter Fry's got green hair. ALL CHANT: Peter Fry's got green hair. Peter Fry's got green hair. Peter Fry's got green hair. Peter Fry's got green hair. Peter Fry's got green hair. Hi, Peggy. Mother's awfully worried. Mother said it might be catching and I shouldn't get too close. Tell your mother she doesn't have to worry. He can't go to school anyway. Why can't I? 'Cause you can't. Oh, yeah? Yeah. They won't let you in school with green hair. You'll have to cut it off. I won't. (School bell rings) Can't tell. Green hair might be catching. Maybe it'll rub off on you. What's wrong with green hair? How'd you like to have your sister marry somebody with green hair? Morning, miss Brand. Morning, Danny. Morning, miss Brand. Morning. Morning, miss Brand. Morning. How many children have black hair? How many children have brown hair? Blonde? Green hair? And red hair? 4 children have black hair. 11 have brown hair. 9 have blonde hair. 1 has green hair and 1 has red hair. Are there any questions? No questions. We'll go on with our history lesson. I knew miss Brand was trying to help me but she couldn't. The whole thing started when they went away. And that letter they left. 'To my son, Peter. 'To be read on his 16th birthday.' They didn't care about me. They just cared about saving other children. They didn't care what happened to me. It was just no use. Now I knew I couldn't stay in Northmount, either. It seemed as though there wasn't any place where a war orphan could settle down. GIRL: Peter. Peter. Look, it is the boy with the green hair. We were waiting for you. You mean, I was supposed to come? We were hoping you would. What for? Your green hair is very beautiful. Beautiful. Yes. Green is the colour of spring. It means hope. A promise of new life to come. About your hair, do people take notice of you? About your hair, do people take notice of you? Do people take notice of me? We thought they would. But why were you crying? Because... Why? Just because. Wouldn't you cry if you woke up one morning and for no reason at all you had green hair? No. I would not cry. You wouldn't? No. Because there is a reason for your green hair. A reason? Yes. A real reason? He did not know. Can you tell me? It is a mark of something good. Like a medal. A medal? There is no one else in all the world with green hair. I know. I'm making medical history. It is hard to have green hair. I don't want to be different, I want to be like everybody else. If it is too hard to have green hair you don't have to. But then of course, nobody will notice you. Nobody will ask why you have green hair. Nobody will ask why you have green hair. Everywhere you go, people will say, they will say, 'There is the boy with the green hair.' And then people will ask, 'Why does he have green hair?' So you will tell them, 'Because I am a war orphan 'Because I am a war orphan 'and my green hair is to remind you that war is very bad for children.' You must tell all the people - the Russians, Americans, Chinese, British, French, all the people all over the world - that there must not be another war. Gee. If enough people believe you there never will be another war and there never will be any more war orphans. But they don't know that. They think everybody has to get killed. The world doesn't have to be blown up. I got to hurry. I'll tell them. I'll tell everybody. It's no fault of the lad's. Certainly none of his doings. I'm not saying it is, Mr Fry, but the fact remains that I've been losing... # Chip, chip... # That'll be himself. Not a word. # ..4 score and 10, sir # Chip, chip, my little horse # Chip, chip again, sir # Can I get there by candlelight? # Chip, chip, my little horse. # Hell, Mr Davis. Dr Knudson. Hi, Gramp. Hello, Peter. Hello, Peter. Well, I guess I'll be going. Just a minute. Are you sick, Gramp? Sick? Oh, no, lad. I never felt better in all my born days. I suppose you've come to talk about what I'm telling everybody. In a manner of speaking. Anything wrong? Er, it seems to be the colour of your hair that's wrong. People have been saying it's the milk. I've been losing customers right and left. I've been losing customers right and left. Of course it's not the milk but that doesn't matter. What's important is that Mr Davis has been losing trade. They want me to cut my hair off. Do you, Gramp? Not if you don't want to, Peter. But the doctor here said if you did cut off your hair it'll come back to its original colour. I said it might, I didn't say it would. I'm not going to cut my hair off. I want it the way it is. It's important. It has a meaning. Alright, Peter. Well, that's the way it's going to be. I had to get away and think. I went back to the glade. I thought maybe the children from the posters could help me. Who's got the scissors? I have. Come on. Let's get him. Help. Help. I lost my glasses. I can't see without my glasses. Help me. Who's there? Don't leave me alone. Where are you? I'm here. Peter. I lost my glasses. I've got them. Give them to me. Please, give them to me, Petie. I won't hurt you. I won't do nothing. Honest. I've got him. I've got him. Hold him. You promised. You thought just because I wear glasses I was a sissy. You thought I'd let you go. Get your bikes. Gramp? Gramp? What is it, Peter? What's the matter? I ran away. They tried to cut my hair off. But I wouldn't let them. Who was it? Timmy and Joey. They came after me with scissors but I ran away. Alright. Sit down. Try and catch your breath. I guess Dr Knudson was right. He was saying before in that strange way he has of speaking, he was saying, Peter, learn it's a dangerous thing for a man to have green hair. Can't be done. Do you want me to cut my hair off? Oh, no, laddie. I don't know what's right. People have been saying all manner of things like it's the water, the milk. Parents have been complaining to the school board. Peter...Peter, you know, it's the last thing in the world I want to do to hurt you. But people have been talking. The doctor did say if you cut your hair it might come back in its original colour. You didn't believe me, either. No, laddie, it's not that. But such strange fancies have been cluttering up your heart lately. I want you to be happy and carefree like other boys your age. The barber promised to keep his shop open. We'll get it done. Make the world of difference. You'll feel like a new man. Peter, lad, I can remember when I was a boy, in the summertime I used to have my head shaved and it shined just like ivory and cool, too. Nobody believed me. Nobody listened. Don't take it like that, lad. It's only... Alright. I'll go. It'll be nothing. It'll be for the best. Alright. I'll go. It's nothing at all. Peter, I...I... Anybody want a souvenir? Don't you want it for a keepsake, Mr Fry? Wasn't my idea. Here. Everybody makes fun of me 'cause I wear thick glasses. Well, laddie, it's done. Everything will be fine now. We'll do all manner of great things together. Peter, I want you to drink this warm milk and get some sleep. I'm not going to work tonight. I'm staying home. Peter, you've got to talk to me. Peter, it isn't that you're not eating or not talking to me, it's just knowing that... Maybe it's too late. It's that...I'm sorry. I'm sorry I had anything to do with cutting off your hair. I feel ashamed. I want you to know that. You can drink the warm milk or not, just as you please. That was last night. It sure seems like longer ago. Well, do you believe it? No. That's what I thought. Why should I believe it? You don't believe it yourself. Of course I believe it. Happened to me. If somebody really believes something they don't get discouraged and run away just because they haven't convinced everybody the first try. Thanks for your story, anyway. Where are you going? Away. Away? It's dark and cold out there. You going let me? No. Dr Knudson drove us down. Nice of him, wasn't it? Peter, lad... ..the letter from your father. He wanted you to have it on your 16th birthday. I think you're old enough for it now. Would you like to hear it? 'My dear, Peter, 'your mother isn't here and I will not be for long. 'She had many things to say to you. 'I will try to say them for both of us. 'We left you, Peter, because we had to. 'We had a job to do. 'Try and understand it was because of our great love for you 'and all the world's children. 'You are old enough now to know that death is a sad thing 'because it takes away the great gift of life 'but it need not be sad 'if the gift has been well used. 'Don't be sad for us, Peter. 'Remember us as having died with millions of other people 'for something fine and worthwhile. 'It will have been fine, it will have been worthwhile 'if those who did not die will not forget. 'If they forget, remind them. 'Remind them, Peter.' The letter stops there. Do you believe what the letter said, Gramp? Oh, I do, lad. I do. I'll save it, Gramp. I'll put it together and save it. Goodbye, Peter. It's nice to have known you. When my hair grows back, it's going to grow back green. Bright boy, isn't he? Very. An interesting case. Very. Any questions? No. Doctor, I'm not really concerned with whether the boy's hair was green or not, I believe in what he was trying to say. I guess I do, too. That's all that matters then, isn't it? Good night. Good night, doctor. Night, sir. Night and thanks. # Chip, chip, my little horse # Chip, chip again, sir # How many miles to Dublin town? # 4 score and 10, sir BOTH: # Chip, chip, my little horse # Chip, chip again, sir # Can I get there by candlelight? # You can and back again, sir # Chip, chip, my little horse # Chip, chip again, sir # How many miles to Dublin town? # 4 score and 10, sir # Chip, chip, my little horse Chip, chip again, sir # Will I be there by candlelight?
