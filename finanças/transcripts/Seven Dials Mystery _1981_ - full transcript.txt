[upbeat music] [clock ticking] [wind howling] [footsteps pattering] [clock ticking] [murmurs] [keys clanking] [bell rings] [soft music] [water splashing] [birds chirping] [bell rings] [clock ticking] [footsteps pattering] Sorry, I say Tredwell, am I the last down? No sir, Mr. Wade, has not come down yet, sir. Lazy blitter Fresh coffee, sir. Well done, Tredwell. I'm afraid I'm a bit late, Lady Coote, what? Sir Oswald says, "There's nothing for a young man "getting on in the world, but punctual habits." Well, he should know, shouldn't he? I mean, still king of Europe. Knighted to the New Year's honours List. He must have been very punctual in his habits. Oh, he still is, but for all that we haven't got a home of our own just rented accommodation. Oh, the home of the Marquis of Caterhan is hardly rented accommodation, Lady Coote. Chimneys is one of the most beautiful houses in Sussex, simply oozing with history. Oh it has so much about the history, but there's a lot of damp about. Oh, I know. I'm a very lucky woman. It's nice to have somewhere to invite people to. My goddaughter and her friends. -[sighs] -Gets lonely being a lady. My husband and I never had any children of our own you see. Well, if you can manage without me, I'll just go and pick some roses for his desk. It's the only thing the gardener here will let me do. [cutlery clanking] I'm glad you are here, Mr... Thesiger. Must make a nice change from the Foreign Office. Oh, actually I'm not at the Foreign Office. The others are. Gerry, Ronny and Bill but not me. Oh, What do you do then? Nothing actually. [chuckles] I'm a sort of man about turn, I suppose. [chuckles] Oh, that'd be why you don't have to get up in the morning. [laughs] [murmuring] One can follows another to ring the bell. One... Oh, good morning, Pongo old-chap turn that incredible mind of yours to 10 across. Do as you use that ridiculous name down here. I'm not a guest. I'm Mr. Oswald's private secretary and in that capacity My name is Rupert Bateman. Sorry. The fact that we had the misfortune to be at school together is not one that should subject me to ridicule. Apologies old-chap. If you could persuade your friend Mr. Wade to appear for breakfast before noon, it would considerably enhance the domestic harmony of the household. And another thing, could you kindly leave Sir Oswald's copy of the times alone. I think I'll got make myself agreeable to those bastered girls. Do you know where they are? Judging from the noise coming from the lake, I would say they were attempting, without much success to punt. -[Man] Jimmy! -Jimmy [Man] Where's Gerry? You don't mean to say he's not up yet? [Oars clanking] If he's not careful, he'll miss breakfast all together one day or his lunch, or tea, and his rose down. It's very, very moody of him. why, he's got to be okay We'll get him out of bed for you. We'll pull him out. Come on Jimmy. Here's some champagne. Come on Gerry, champagne. [laughing] Beat you there. No, I got a much better idea. [bottles clinking] [champagne popping] [cheering] We'll do something tomorrow morning you know? Get him at 7:00 crack of dawn. Oh, that's when dawn cracks, I've often wondered. [all laughing] So how do you suggest we achieve this miracle? Oh, cold water judiciously applied. Oh, you don't know Gerry, if Niagara Falls would land flat on his face he'd only he turn over and go back to sleep. [all laughing] Oh, you must think of something subtler than cold water. Who's got any brains? [birds chirping] Ah. Oh Lord. [laughs] Pongo, Pongo! Pongo was always the one for brains. Been his misfortune from his youth. Look at him, just like the white rabbit. He hasn't got any whiskers. I say Pongo, old-chap. -[All] Pongo! -Pongo. -Pongo. -[All] Pongo. I really... I really am in the greatest possible hurry. I have to take some papers up to town for Sir Oswald [Gerry] It is Saturday. [chuckles] We can't all work at the Foreign Office. We'll only keep you a moment. Now you have brains. [water splashes] [laughs] We need them. What exactly is the problem? My friend, Gerry Wade. [bells ringing] [cutlery clanking] Any sign of him yet? No, my lady. It's very late. Yes, my lady. I suppose he will come down sometime, Tredwell. Oh, undoubtedly, my lady. It was 11:30 yesterday morning when Mr. Wade came down. Now it's quarter to twelve. Yes, my lady. That is a very odd look on you, Tredwell. [cutlery clinking] I am accustomed to the ways of young gentlemen, my lady. But it is not right, Tredwell. Having to clear away and then get lunch on the table by 1:00. I don't know how they do it these young people. Hardly give themselves time to work up an appetite. I don't know what the answer is, I'm sure. An alarm clock. [birds chirping] Now, if you'd excuse me. One alarm clock. It would take about a dozen to disturb Gerry Wade, Oh, why not? We'll all go into market base and then buy one alarm clock each. [all laughing] Who said we hadn't got any rent? [glasses clinking] -[car honking] -[engine revving] Come on. Come on. [engine revving drowns out the speaker] [engine revving] Come on. [bell tolling] Morning, Mrs... Lady Coote. -Where are the others? -Punting. -Mmh? -On the lake, I believe. It's rather early in the morning for punting, isn't it? Not so very early in the morning. I'm afraid I was a bit late in coming down. It is extraordinary that wherever I happen to be standing, I'm always the last one down. Very extraordinary. I don't know why it is. I can't think I'm sure. Why didn't you just get up? [car engine revving] [tyres screeching] [birds chirping] [door opening] Vera, you hide these in your room. I got next an extra one for Lady Coote. She suffered- Looks like Pongo's brilliant idea. [Vera] How many is that altogether? -Eight? -[alarm clock ringing] [All] Shh. [birds chirping] [footsteps] Well that ought to wake him. Come on. Tintinnabulation. 10 across. One camp follows another to ring the bell. Not now Jimmy there's a good chap. [soft music] Four tricks and a rubber. I think I was very lucky to get four tricks there. Well played, Parker, jolly well-played. Oh, no really it's just that I'm lucky at the game. You'd have to be lucky playing the way you do. [Gerry laughing] Got no card sense at all. I know dear you're always telling me and you owe me, Mr. Wade, eight pounds and ten shillings Do I? 1700 that's 18 pounds, that's correct, isn't it Mr Wade? Perfectly correct, Lady Coote Well, I don't know about you lot But after that, I need a drink. Thesiger? Oh, whiskey and splash, thirsty work, dancing sir. -Wade? -That goes for me. I have you ever played Solo Whist Mr. Wade? Now that's a real game And god mama is compromise ruthless when she plays it you Mr. Wade. She once won Ms Air with three aces in her hand. Very subtle. Don't be cheeky Vera. Good news from Swansea, sir. The tests are conclusive, it works. I always thought it would. Bennett will bring the formula back to you personally on Monday. Say he goes to bed about 12, how long do you think were to give him, about an hour? No, no, no, no Single sentences one, glorious whatnot to govern intervals? Oh, five minute intervals, starting at half past six. I suppose this is a good idea. Mustn't weaken. Come on, let's not look suspicious. Cheers. -Cheers -Cheers. [Woman] Cheers. [soft music] I thought he'd never out his light out, but I put my head on the door and he's sound off, how about it? -Where's Bill? -Getting the girls. -Clocks? -[clock ticking] Here, master. They're all set? All those little knobs it took me hours. Well done. Whose going to do the deed? Pongo, of course, walks like a cat, would you notice, ready to bill. Bill. Pongo, is best because if Gerry should happen to wake up Pongo will think of some rotten silly thing to relay his suspicions. Something subtle? Exactly. Guys, I have to be up at 5:30. [All] Shhh! Sorrows won't believes for two hours work daily before breakfast including Sundays is worth 2% on the annual turnover What a depressing thought. Now then, the soon as he gets it over with the sooner you get back to bed. Ronny, open the door. Wait, one, two, Buckle my shoe. [All laughing] In you go. [clocks ticking] Three, four. Knock at the door. [all laughing] Shhh. [clock ticking] [coughing] [clock ticking] Five, six, Pick up sticks. I'd say all those clock's ticking away make a definite row, hope he doesn't wake up. Even old Gerry as he is coming failed to miss it surely, I have sometimes thought that even Gerry can be quite the ass he makes himself out to be. Oh don't they be all subtle. Seven, eight. Eight [clock ticking] Can I go back to get back to bed? I think we all better get back to bed. And remember to be up early everyone, you don't want to miss the fun. Hello, sorry. [bells tolling] I'd say this is beyond anything, I don't understand it, the first one woke me. What a jokes this has gone too far. [speaking over each other] It's not like old Gerry, is it? Excuse me sir. [Bill] What's up, Treadwell? Mr. Wade not having come down, sir. I took the liberty of sending John, up to his room. -[Bill laughing] -Yes. I'm afraid sir, the poor young gentlemen must have died in his sleep. No that is impossible. That fool John has made a mistake. He's asleep, that's all, just asleep. No, sir john made no mistake. Dr. Cartwright is here. He would like to see you in the drawing room if you'd be so good sir. Gerry. Go, we'll look after the the girls. I understand that you were a great friend of Mr. Wade. His greatest friend. Do you know if he's in the habit of drinking stuff to make him sleep. No, he always slept like a top. You never heard him complain of sleeplessness? Never. There will have to be an inquest, I'm afraid. Well, how did he die? I should say an overdose of chloral. Stuff is by the bed. And the bottle, and the glass. Any question of foul play? Any cause to suspect it? None whatsoever. And suicide? Certainly not. No troubles that you know of, money troubles, a woman. Now about relations. Well he only has a sister. A half sister, rather, she lives at Dean Manor about 25 miles from here. [car approaching] Supposed you're about the best pal I have right now. But something I want to tell you something I think you should know. How, about Gerry? Yes, the thing is, I don't know whether I ought to. Well, perhaps you're better not. Well, I'm bound by a kind of promise, you see. Why don't you just get it off your chest. It's no good Jimmy, I can't. Just as you'd like. [car engine revving] What is she like? This girl, Gerry's sister. [dog barking] Mr. Thesiger what a lovely surprise. You mustn't mind Lady, she's just had some puppies and she's very suspicious. This is Ronny Devereux, Miss Wade. You're Ronny, Gerry talks about you a lot. You're all over at Chimneys, aren't you. Why hasn't he come with you? I'm afraid we have some bad news for you. Gerry? He's dead. How? When? Last night. It seems he uh... It must have been an accident. He seems to have taken an overdose of chloral A sleeping drug, Gerry? I can't believe it either. Look here, would you like to come with us now? If you'd rather not-- Of course I must come. Only I need to be alone, a little first. I have my own car I'll follow in half an hour. It was very kind of you to come. Can't have been easy. I've been in to see him. Are you going in? Oh, I don't think so. I think all his friends should. Why? It's a sign of respect. Very well. [door opening] [clocks ticking] [melancholic music] Did you notice the clocks? Yes I did. Who do you think arrange them like that? All in a row. One of the servants tidying up I suppose. The funny thing here is that there are seven of them not eight. One of them is missing. Inconsiderate that's what I call it distinctly inconsiderate. People have to die somewhere But they don't need to die in my house. Lots of people have. Masses of stuffy old great grandfathers and grandmothers. That's quite different. Of course I expect family to die here. But I do object to strangers. You know, I appreciate getting back to Tredwell more than I can say that man studies my comfort in the most marvellous manner. I met Gerry Wade once. He was a friend of Bills. You'd have liked him father. No, I shouldn't. I Don't like anyone who dies in my house on purpose to annoy me. [scofs] What happened to the inquest, you know? Death by misadventure. Oh they had to show some consideration for the sisters feelings, I suppose. Was there a sister? Yeah, half sister I believe. She was much younger. Old way ran away with their mother. He was always doing that sort of thing. No woman ever appealed to him unless she belonged to some other man. Well I'm glad that's one bad habit you haven't got. By the way not nervous, are you? A fella died in your bed you know. My bed? Yours. Why did have to die in my bed? Because what I said. Damned inconsiderate. Everyone damned inconsiderate nowadays. Well not that I mind. Why should I? I should mind very much. I should dream of things you know? Yeah, spackle hands and clinking chains. Well Great Aunt Louisa died in your bed and when you don't see her spook hovering over you. I do sometimes, especially after lobster Well thank heavens I'm not superstitious. [door squeaking] [clock winding] [door opening and closing] [eerie music] September the 21st. Oh surely that was... Dear Lorraine, I will be down on Wednesday. [Gerry] I'm feeling awful fit, and rather pleased with myself all round. Be heavenly to see you. Look here, do forget what I said about the Seven Dials I thought it was going to be more or less of a joke but it isn't anything bad. I'm sorry I ever said anything about it. It's not the kind of business kids like you ought to be mixed up in. Something else I also meant to tell you but I'm so sleepy, I can't seem to keep my eyes open. [eerie music] All I'm saying is please be careful Me, why? Look there was something worrying Gerry, not the kind of thing that would make him want to... It was to do with the department, so I can't really-- Talk about it, no, I understand. Sometimes Gerry would come back here from the Foreign Office, quiet, tired. Not at all the kind of person he went around pretending to be. He couldn't talk either. He'd walk the dogs. In the evening, we'd read, play music. He'd go back to London feeling better. You were very close weren't you? We'd both of us had rotten childhoods, it brought us together I suppose. Lorraine, I know this is not the time not after what you've been through in the past few days. But I'm not going to rest until I find the devils that killed Gerry. Killed him? And when I've done that, may I come back? Yes, of course. Good night Ronny. Father, I'm going up town I the Delage. Can't stand the monotony down here any longer. We only came home yesterday. Well yeah, seems more like 100 years. I'd forgotten how dull the country could be. I don't agree with you. It's peaceful that's what it is. Peaceful and extremely comfortable. I don't want comfort, I want excitement. In my experience people who go around looking for trouble usually find it. [car wheels crunching] [car engine revving] [whistling] [birds chirping] [tyres screeching] Seven Dials. Tell-- Who, tell who? Tell, Jimmy Thesiger. Shot? Shot. How could he have been? I don't know how he could have been but he was. We really shouldn't go about shooting people you know. They don't like it. I dare say some of them richly deserve it. But it only leads to trouble in the end. Father you haven't been listening to a word I said, I did not shoot him. Well, if you didn't, who did? Nobody knows. But that's nonsense. A man can't be run over and shot without anyone doing it. He wasn't running over. I thought you said he was? I said I thought I had. Well, who was he this man? Anyone we know? Police found papers in his wallet, his name was Ronny Devereux, he worked in the Foreign Office. Oh, well, that explains it. What was it you said he said just before you died? Seven Dials, tell Jimmy Thesiger. Very few last words. Your grandfather said pass the mustard and off we went just like that. You don't know Jimmy Thesiger do you? Thesiger, Thesiger? One of the Yorkshire Thesiger? That's what I'm asking you. Do pay attention father this is very important. Ahh, Your great aunt Selina married a Thesiger. What do you says that to me? It wasn't much used to her if I remember rightly. You are impossible I should have to ask Bill. He knows everybody. Wish I could remember exactly what Gerry Wade said in that letter. Something about a joke. A seven dhows business wasn't a joke? Oh God, I heard someone mentioned Seven Dials recently. Me Father 30 seconds ago. Oh, I knew I'd heard it before. I sent a letter on to her. It was it puzzling sort of letter. Not the kind of brother usually writes to a sister. What sister, half sister. No blood relation at all. Very pretty girl so they tell me. That would explain it. That's Funny. In The Times? Hhhmmm. There's no mention of Ronny Devereux. It's not a word about a shooting or an accident or anything you think that'd be something? [clock bells ringing] Got it. Got what? Seven Dials. Knew it sounded familiar. George Lomax. George Lomax? Called in here yesterday when you were out running that chap over. Seemed very worried. Seems he does some sort of political shindig in his place next week. And he got a warning letter, What sort of warning letter. Oh, beware,trouble ahead that sort of nonsense. Written from Seven Dials. Said he was off to London to consult Scotland Yard about it. You would. You're not off again? Things to do father, things to do. Father, what did you say the name of that team policeman friend of yours was? Battle. Why? [Bundle murmurs] [car engine revving] A young lady sir has called to see you. Don't be a fool Stevens its the middle of the night. No sir, it is 11:30 o'clock in the morning and a young lady has called to see you. Do you know why Stevens? I couldn't say sir. I suppose you couldn't. I don't think I want to get up and see this lady. Yes, I suppose I better. She, she didn't give her name? No sir. What is she like Stevens? The young lady is most undoctordy. strictly calm, ill, furl if I may use the expression. You may use it Stevens. Your friends pronunciation if I may say so, is extremely good. Much better than mine. And gratified to hear sir. I have lately been taking a correspondence course in French. Have you really Stevens. You're a remarkable chap. Oh run my bath would you, and see the young lady has a pot of tea and the morning paper. If you will a wait in here miss. [Jimmy] Another one? She declines to give her name sir, but says her business is important. This is odd Stevens. I mean two girls turning up, damned odd. What was I up to last night? I mean, what time did I come home? Just upon five o'clock sir nothing more. Well, I suppose I better go and face the pheromones. If I might suggest, sir, Not in our stocking feet. How rarely Stevens. I really just thought, are you by any chance Lorraine Wade? How clever of you to know. I really just realised you're in mourning, I'm terribly sorry, I'm Bundle Brent. You sent me Gerry's letter. That's what I've come to see Jimmy about. I tried to get hold of Ronny Devereux, he was Gerry's best friend you know, but they say he isn't there. He's dead. I'm terribly sorry. [Jimmy] Dead? He was shot, I'm afraid, yesterday. That's why I've come to see you. Old Ronny. Shot! Just before he died he tried to say something. It was a message to you. He said, "Seven Dials. "Tell Jimmy Thesiger." Seven Dials? It was in that letter. Bundle found it in her desk. She kindly sent it on to me. Bundle. Lady Eileen Brent, Jimmy Thesiger. That's what my friends call me, sorry. Bill Eversleigh, they gave me your address. Oh yes, of course. It's that bit there. "Do forget what I said about the Seven Dials business." What was it he wanted you to forget? I had opened a letter of his by mistake. It had some address at the Seven Dials at the head of it. I realised it wasn't for me. So I put it back in the envelope without reading it. Gerry didn't seem to mind much he laughed. He asked me if I'd ever heard of the Mafia. And then said, "Wouldn't it be queer "if a society like that started here in England?" I'm beginning to see. The Seven Dials must be the headquarters of some sort of secret society. Gerry knew that if that society suspected you had any knowledge of its activity, you'd be in danger. That's why he was so anxious, you should forget what he told you. And he was quite right. Now look here, you've done your bit. You've delivered Ronny's message. It's different for me I was Ronny's pal, but for God sake, you keep out of it, you and Bundle. Do you think for one minute I'd keep out of it? Someone killed my brother. Killed, you think it was murder? Ronny did, he was sure of it. When did he tell you this? [Lorraine] The night before last, he took me out to dinner. And yesterday somebody shot him. Now will you please understand. Why should anyone want to kill Gerry Wade? Well, I could make a shrewd guess. Gerry spoke excellent German, didn't he? Perfect. I think in reality Gerry was pretty high up in the Secret Service. After all, he was at the Foreign Office. And I remember saying at Chimneys he couldn't be quite the ass he made himself out to be. He wasn't. And if you're right? Then the thing's bigger than we thought. This Seven Dials business isn't barely criminal, it's international. -Cootes. -What? I knew there was something I'd forgotten, Cootes. George Lomax. His Majesty's UnderSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs. -Ronny's boss. -And Bill Eversleigh's. Well Cootes, is having some sort of political shindig next week and he's had a warning letter from Seven Dials too, now what do you think that points to? Something's going to happen there? Well, that's what I think so. -Someone's got to go. -Agreed. Do you think I could work it through Bill? He's bound to be there has he's Cootes right hand man. Rich young man interested in politics anxious to save a parliament you mean, that sort of thing might work. Hmmn, too bad you can't do be there. Don't be too sure. What about me? Oh, you're not in on this act. I'm just to go and wait. I knew you would understand. Three of us forcing our way in might look rather suspicious. You do see that, don't you? I suppose so. Then it's settled, you do nothing. [Bundle] Superintendent Battle. Hmn? [Bundle] Could you give me a list of secret societies that had the headquarters in Seven Dials? Strictly speaking lady, I hear there's no such place as Seven Dials nowadays. Most of it was pulled down or rebuilt. Lets say, I should pretty much like to know what put that neighbourhood into your head? A man was shot yesterday. I thought I'd run over him, Sir Ronny Devereux. [Bundle] Oh you know about it. Why was there nothing about it in the papers? It will be in the papers tomorrow. Playing for time are you? It will be in the papers tomorrow. When he was dying, he mentioned the Seven Dials. Thank you, I'll make a note of that. Leave it all to you. We are the professionals. And I'm only an amateur. Well, I may not have your professional skill and knowledge, but I have one advantage over you. I can work in the dark. Of course, if you won't give me a list of your secret societies. Oh, calm down lady, I, I never said that. You should have a list of a whole lot. The Brothers of St. Sebastian, The Wolfhounds, The Comrades of Peace, The Friends of Oppression, Children of Moscow, The Herrings, Comrades of The Foreign, half a dozen more. You're giving me this because you know it's not of the slightest use to me. You want me to leave the whole thing alone? I should prefer it. [phone ringing] I said just now that an amateur could do things a professional couldn't. You didn't contradict me. That's because you're an honest man Superintendent Battle. You knew I was right. Please, if it's a chance for an amateur, let me have it. What you propose is dangerous. And when I say dangerous I mean dangerous. I grasp that I'm not a fool. No. I'll give you one little clue. I think Mr. Bill Eversleigh will be able to tell you all you want to know about Seven Dials. Bill. I'll tell you Bundle nobody goes there anymore. It was boring really. And my God, you can't get tired of fried fish. Fried fish? What are you talking about? Seven Dial's Club of course. What are you talking about? Club? It used to be semi sort of District. It's all cleaned up now but Seven Dials Club keeps the old atmosphere, fried fish and chips. General squad, overly handy to get that after a show. Good, we are going there tonight. [car engine revving] What I want to know is why you're so unwilling. Unwilling? Painfully so, what's the guilty secret? There's no guilty secret. It's just it's such an awfully mixed bunch. Artists, you know, all sorts of odd women. I tell you Bundle it's played out. Odd women? [upbeat music and crowd chatting] Nobody comes here now. Is that it? Told you So. [crowd chattering indistinctively] See what I mean? We could had a good chips, I'd much rather go up to the Ritz, come on. I'd much rather go upstairs. You said there was a backrow room. It might be raided. Father will bail me out. Bundle. [crowd chatting indistinctively] Ah, good evening. It's Alfred, isn't it? Used to be a foot man at Chimneys? Yes ma'am. Well how are you Alfred? Nice and thank you your ladyship. [Bundle] When did you leave, Alfred? About a month ago, my lady. Chance for bettering myself, seemed fit enough for me to take it. Quite right Alfred, quite right. Bundle, come on. Thank you. [crowd chattering] I hope you're not going to regret this Bundle. I told you, you wouldn't like it. It's not quite what I expected that's all. Has Jimmy Thesiger been in touch with you? About going down to Wyvern Abbey next weekend? -He has. -[champangne pop] Long rigmarole he wants me to stuff Cootes with about wanting to see the political light, or some such rubbish. [Bundle chuckles] Have you got him an invitation? I told Cootes, he was richer than Rothschild. And if there's one thing Cootes is dedicated to it's party funds. This meeting a Cootes place, anything special? Usual sort of mark. People who have to be impressed that sort of thing. The Air Minister and the Secretary, O'Rourke, Sir Oswald and Lady Coote, and the mysterious Countess. Young, beautiful and Hungarian. What is old Cootes up to we, all ask ourselves, Nothing very interesting if he's running through to form. [both chuckle] Now I'm going to thank you for an interesting evening and throw you out. Wait, it isn't late? I know but I've got a long day ahead of me tomorrow. What are you going to do? That depends, but I can tell you this Bill. I'm not going to let the grass grow under my feet. Never does. Some of those clocks have always given me the shivers. I dream of them sometimes. Silly, isn't it? Seven clocks unreal. Not seven clocks, Seven Dials. Don't you see there's a pattern to it. I think your friend Ronny was on to it. He was trying to tell you. "Seven Dials. "Tell Jimmy Thesiger." Bundle, are you sure that's all he said? Quite sure. Death concentrates the mind most wonderfully. It's the inquest tomorrow, I'm a witness. Well may I come with you? Last respects and all that. I'll be glad of the company. Gerry Wade, Ronny. Makes you wonder who's going to be next? I suppose you know what you're doing here is dead against the law. We've only been raided twice, my lady-- I'm not talking about gambling, there's more than that. Probably a great deal more than you know. I'm going to ask you a discrete question Alfred, and I should like the truth please. How much were you paid for leaving Chimneys? It was like this, my lady. The Russian gentleman, Mr. Mosgorovsky who owns this club would come down at Chimneys on one of our open days and it seems he liked the way I showed people around the house. He offered me 100 pounds to leave that instant moment and come here and look after this club, and three times the wages I earned as a footman, my lady. Well I do see how it was difficult to refuse. But did he say who was to take your place at Chimneys? Mr. Mosgorovsky knew of a young chap when in good service and ready to come in minutes so I mentioned his name, to Mr. Treadwell and everything was settled pleasantly. You don't want to be sent to penal servitude, do you Alfred? Oh no my lady you don't mean it. I want to help you Alfred. And if things go wrong, well, I'll -put in a good word for you. -Anything I can do my lady -I should be only too pleased. -Right. I mean, I would anyway. I want to go over this place from top to bottom. [eerie music] What's through there? What's in here? That's used as a getaway, your ladyhip. There's a room through there with a door on the same stairs that comes out on next street. So where the Gentry goes when there's a raid. Don't the police know about it? It's a kind door, you see my lady. Just looks like a cupboard that's all. -Take me in there. -I can't. Mr. Mosgorovsky... Mr. Mosgorovsky he has the key. There are other keys Alfred. Shouldn't have to tell a footman that. [eerie music] That's the escape room my lady. It's locked. There's only one key unlocks that door, truly. Highly ingenius that is. Looks all right when it's open shelves, ledgers in there. Nobody would ever suspect, but you touch a right spot and the old thing swings open. sound proofed? I wouldn't know my lady. You won't find no dirt. Not to speak of. Mr. Mosgorovsky, he ordered the place to be swept out this morning and I did it while he waited. This morning? That means it's going to be used tonight. Alfred, you've got to find me a place in here to hide. That's impossible my lady. Look, you'll get me into trouble and I lose my job. You lose your job anyway if you go to prison. But my lady there ain't no place to hide. -What's in there? -It's not a place. Stuff we don't use. Look, you can save yourself. There's no place in there as a cat could hide. Alfred, get a large tray and carry all this lot downstairs. Quickly, there's no time to lose whether you But my lady you can't it's getting late, the cooks will be here any minute. Then don't waste time talking. You need a large tray and a brazen bit. And two dry martinis. What for? Me. [soft piano music playing] Shouldn't you be doing your homework? A chap can only concentrate for so long. Besides I bet Bundles burning up politics enough for two. Confusion to our enemies It's a bit of a tight fit. Alfred, shut the door, let me see what I can see. I suppose that will have to do. Now you take that and give me that. Now shut the door. But my lady, they'll find you if they open the door. They won't open the door because you're going to lock in and take away the key. And if by chance Mr. Mosgorovsky should ask for the key? Tell him it's lost. But my lady, you'll be taken bad you'll faint. I never faint. Now lock me in. [eerie music] I've had much difficulty in getting away tonight. I'm not like Number Four here my own master. One o'clock being a great success. I congratulate you on taking the risk. Unless one takes risks. Where is the mysterious Number Seven then? Aren't we gooing to meet him tonight either? I'm beginning to believe there's no such person. I should not advice you to think that my friend. I agree Number One, where is our president? He who called us into being, why do we never see him? Number Seven has his own ways of working. So you always say. And I will say more. I pity the man or woman who comes up against him. Now shall we get down with our business? The Seven Dials. First, to our absent comrade Number Two, I wish he could have been with us tonight. There is danger. Grave danger. Number Three, you have the plans of Wyvern Abbey? Here Sir. And the list of guests? Just an ATP. Mr. Terence O'Rourke, Sir Oswald and Lady Coote, Mr. Bateman, Countess Radzsky, Mr. Eversleigh, Mr. James Thesiger. Who is Mr James Thesiger? The usual complete young ass. I see, I suppose there is no doubt whatsoever of the value of Eberhard invention. None whatever. Commercially it should be worth millions. And internationally, well, one knows only too well the greed of nations, veritable gold mine. Well worth a few lives. You have all seen the plans. We've all agreed to the original scheme. Good. By the way, I hear something about a letter of Gerald Wade's that has been found. A letter that mentions this organisation. Who found it? Lord Caterham's daughter, Lady Eileen Brent. Bauer, I should be known to that. It was very careless of him. Who was the letter written to? His sister, I believe. Unfortunate, but cannot be helped now. There's just one last thing to be said. A message from Number Seven. "My friend and he may be our last chance. "If we do not achieve our object there, "the opportunity may not repeat itself." So comrades, I must ask you to pledge yourselves, your skills and if necessary, your lives to that which Number Seven has asked of us. Too poor Alfred nearly I'll figure out. Cramp was the worst time. Bundle this just isn't the sort of business for a girl to get mixed up in. But look what I found out. Yeah and it wouldn't have done you much good, would it? If they find you out. The absent Number Two is obviously Bauer. Our footman. You're probably be unfrocked or unclocked or whatever it is you call it, for not spotting that letter. Very careless of him. I shouldn't be at all surprised if he wasn't the one that murdered poor old Gerry Wade. I wonder if they'll ever find out. The German inventors name was, Eberhart? Eberhard, yes, why? No it's just coming back to me. Eberhard had a patent process as applied to steel. Some of the toughens of wire so much there becomes a strong as a steel bar. His idea was that the weight of an aeroplane would be so enormously reduced, that the cost of flying would be revolutionised. [Bundle whistling] He offered his invention to the German government but they didn't believe it would work so they turned him down. So now he's offering it to our government. They are taking Sir Oswald Coote expert opinion on it. That's what this meeting is all about. Nothing to do with politics at all. That's just a cover. They're going to discuss Eberhard plans or process or -whatever it is-- -Formula, I think formula -is a good word myself. -And Eberhard formula will be at Wyvern Abbey and The Seven Dials are out to steal it. The Russians said it will be worth millions. I suppose it would be. Well worth a few lives. That's what the other man said. And you say they knew about my being there? Yes. The American said not to worry. You were only the usual kind of ass. Uh, I'm glad you tell me that. Gives me what you might call a personal interest in the case. [car engine revving] [piano music playing] [gentle knock on the door] I say Stevens wants to go out and buy a new pistol? Pistol sir? What kind of pistol would you be requiring sir? The kind where you put your finger on the trigger and it goes bang and goes on going bang until you take it off? An automatic Sir? If you say so Stevens, an automatic. Oh, and I would like it to be a blue nosed one. In American fiction, the hero always takes his blue nosed automatic from his hip pocket. If you say so sir. [car engine roaring] [George] My dear Eileen, I can't tell you how pleased I am to welcome into Wyvern Abbey. I was both surprised and delighted when you're aunt tell me about your interest in politics. Well, I wanted to come very much. Do you know Thesiger? Quite a young fella But a remarkable grasp for foreign policy. I knew, Mr Thesiger. -Good afternoon. -Mr Secretary, the Air Minister, just turned into the driveway. Do excuse me for one moment, won't you. Bill, Bill! Look here, you mustn't be angry, but I've just told Bill about how little stunt. Bill? Well, Bill was one of the lads, you know, Gerry was a pal of his and he was Ronny. Well I knew that. Oh but you think it's a pity? Sorry. It's not that, it's that... He's all right, but Bill is a born blunderer. Not mentally very agile. But you forget one thing, Bill has got a very hefty fist which might come in handy. -[chuckles] -Oh well, perhaps you're right. How did he take it? Oh He clutched his head a lot. I mean, the facts took some driving home, but by repeating the thing in words of one syllable I eventually got through. And now he's with us to the death, as you might say. Lady Eileen, I may I present, the Air Minister, Sir Stanley Digby. Sir Stanley, Lady Eileen Brent. Delighted to meet you Lady Eileen. How do you do. That is Mr. Terence O'Rourke, Sir Stanley's personal assistant. How do you do, Mr. O'Rourke. And Mr. James Thesiger. How do you do. [bells ringing] Superintendent Battle. That's right Lady Eileen. What are you doing here? Keep an eye on things. That warning letter you know, fairly put the wind at Mr. Lomax. Nothing would do for him that I should come down myself. Don't you think you might be-- You think I might be recognised? Well, I did think so, yes. Put them on there guard, ei, well lady Eileen, why not? Why not? We don't want any unpleasantness, do we? Don't want to be too clever. Just show any light finger gentry that might be about the place we'll just show them somebody on the spot so to speak. It's great mistake to be too clever. The great thing is not to have any unpleasantness this weekend. [Indistinctive group chatting] Hallo Bundle, I've seen you before but haven't kept my nose to the grindstone the whole blessed afternoon. Cares of state heavy tonight? Oh, you don't know what you all fellows like it's a good natured little chap, but Cootes this is absolutely impossible. Drive drive drive from morning to night. Everything you do is wrong and everything you haven't done you ought to have done. Quite like a quotation from the prayer book. Nobody knows what I have to put up with. Oh entertaining the countess eh? Oh poor bill that must have been a sad stream to a misogynist like yourself. What's this, what's this. After tea contess asked Bill to show her around the interesting old place. Ah yes, the contess, where is she? By any judgement of a woman just waiting for the very last moment before she makes her entrance. I thought the Irishmen were supposed to be better judges of horses. It depends which you studied Lady Eileen. Where exactly is she anyway? Hungarian youth party, a widow and very, very rich. I suppose why Cootes is cultivating [speaking foreign language] Countess. Countess. I think you'll be interested I've found a map of the Abbey, in the 14th century. How very clever of you Mr. Bateman. Countess. Monsiour Lomax, I have fallen in love with your beautiful house. [speaking a foreign language.] Madam. [speaking a foreign language] How do you do. See what I mean? In my country, my party had money with no organisation. That is why I have come to your country to study the way in which things are done. Well, my husband says nothing can be done without regular hours. He declares you would never have gotten anywhere without them. Doesn't so Mr. Bateman. Yeah now, if you ladies will be kind enough to excuse us, we have something important to discuss in my study. O'Rourke, I shall need you. Bateman! On the left. Bundle I've got to talk to you. I just can't believe what Jimmy just told me. You and that Seven Dial was better. I knew you're the most fightful sport but wierdly, I think that's-- Eversleigh. I'll tell you later. Mr. Oswald. I think if you would be kind enough to take the chair. Sorry sir. [murmuring] Sir. Here we are gentlemen, that's what it's all about. The Eberhard formula. -It works. -It most definitely works. That piece of paper is worth a fortune to somebody. [erie music] So who has the formula now? O'Rourke for safekeeping. He and the minister taking a backup to London in the morning. Ahh, then one things quite clear, any funny business is going to be will be tonight. We've got to be on the alert. We'll divide the night into two watches. Right you are, who will take first duty? Shall we spin for it? -That's well? -All right, it here goes. Head you first, I second, tails vice versa. -Tails. -Oh damn! You get in first watch and probably all the fun that's going. Oh you never know criminals are very uncertain. Where are their rooms, do we know. West Wing, almost self contained. Right What time should I wake you? 3:30, that's about fair i think. What about me? Nothing doing, you go to bed and sleep. Thank you very much. Goodnight. Goodnight bundle. Thought we might have trouble with her. You know how keen she is to be in everything. I thought she took it wonderfully. Yeah, so did I, it stuggered me. [eerie music] Don't forget, 3:30. If you still alive that is. I may have been ass but I'm not nearly as much of an ass as I look. I thought you said about Gerry Wade, do you remember? That very night. Oh shut up you fool. You haven't got any tact. Of course I've got tact. I'm a budding diplomat, all diplomats have tact. You must be still up at the larvae stage. Look here, you will be all right, you know. It's all very Well ragging, When I think of poor old Gerry and then poor old Ronny, I can see I shall have to show you Leopold. A real genuine blue nosed automatic. No is it really? Yes, Steven, my man got him for me. You just press the button and Leopold does the rest. Oh do be careful, and don't... Don't go shooting it off at, the wrong person. I'll deep be walking asleep or anything. That would be most unfortunate. [eerie music] Ha! [car starting and engine revving] [clock bells ringing] [window squeaking] Eileen, can I give you a hand? Superintendent Battle, What are you doing here? I could ask you the same thing. Well I asked you first. Just seeing that nobody's about, who shouldn't be. like you for instance, Lady Eileen. Well, you're not going to send me back are you? Mmm-hhh. I'm rather sick about that because I wanted to go out to the West Wing. Perhaps you're not the only one who would be wanting to do that. Now if you'll excuse me, Lady Eileen, I think it's about time you are getting back to bed. Same way? Same way. [car engine revving] [eerie music] [clock chiming] [clock ticking] [dramatic music] Jimmy. Jimmy. [church bell ringing] [dramatic music] [Bells chiming] [dramatic music] Bill. Bill. [screaming] Bill! [screams] Bill where are you? Quick, quick, they are killing each other. Oh do be quick! [gun shot] [gunshot] [dramatic music] Jimmy. Jimmy. He's dead. [screaming] What on earth! I was fast asleep that row woke me up. -[bang] -Good God! Excuse me sir I better see to what's happening. -Bill, where have you been? -[bang] [screaming] I'm not sure but I think I'm frightened. -Bill. -Sir. See what's happening. The damn thing is locked. Could somebody kindly tell me What's going on? Its after two in the morning. Quiet down Lady Coote. Lady Coote we'll soon have the situation under control. Let us in, do you hear? Bill, bang on the door. It's all right, he's been shot in the right arm, but it isn't a loss of blood that knocked him out, he must have cracked his head against the floor as he fell. [Lomax] Who is in there, open this door at once. I suppose we should have to. Okay open the door. Superintendent, -what's going on? -Oh Jimmy! -What is all this? -Good God, oh Jimmy. Oh poor, poor boy. Lady, do you think you could help me down? Battle, what has happened? -Did you get him? -Who? The man who climbed on the IV. I was standing by the door there, grabbed him and we had a set two. Probably some nasty murderous cat burglar. Oh, I'm afraid we made rather a mess of things. Where is Leopold, the pride of the blue nosed automatics? Now this? Oh, that's him. How many shots have been fired? One shot. I'm disappointed Leopold. I couldn't press the button properly, otherwise it would gone on-- Who shot first? Well, I did, I'm afraid. You see, he twisted himself out of my grasp but was heading for the window. So I closed my finger down on Leopold and let him have it. That's when he turned and fired at me. After that, I suppose I must have taken the cut My God Lomax, you don't think they've got away with it? I'm afraid they have sir. When the disturbances began down here I ran straight to O'Rourke's room. -It was locked. -Yours wasn't sir, there's a communicating door. He's heavily drugged and the formula is gone. Battle I left all the arrangements to you. If those papers fall into the wrong hands In pointing fact, sir, they fell straight into this young lady's hands if you'd excuse me. Sir Stanley, I think you will find everything you want there. My dear young lady, we are infinitely obliged to you. Yes, indeed, I'm afraid I don't know who you are. Oh, this is Miss Wade, Mr. Lomax, Gerald Wades sister. Superintendent, wouldn't it be wise to send for a doctor? That's very thoughtful of you Pongo. Mr. O'Rourke is unconscious. Phone for Dr. Hansen. Bill let's go see if we can do anything for him until the doctor gets here. Perhaps I could do something. That's a very motherly woman, very motherly woman. I wonder-- Don't stop there Superintendent. I wondering, where Sir Oswald Coote might be. Picking up rubbish from the log. Now what's been happening? [Battle] Attempted robbery, sir. You mean the formula's safe? Mmm-hhh. Well, then this must have been thrown down by one of the thieves as he took to his heels. I've handled it very carefully. Thought you might want to examine it to fingerprint. You think of everything, sure. What I can't understand is why nobody pursued this thief. It wasn't until we heard Mr. Thesiger's story that we knew there was anyone to pursue. He must have left for it as soon as he fired the short. Then why wasn't a search organised? My men were told to hold anyone attempting to leave the grounds. And yet they haven't done so. And yet they haven't done so. Are you telling me all that you know Superintendent? All that I know, Mr. Oswald, what I think is another matter. And what do you think Superintendent? For one thing sir, I think there's far too much IV about this place. Excuse me surely got a bit in your coat here. Far too much IV, it complicates things. Excuse me, Superintendent. Oh, there you are, Sir Oswald. Lady Coote just discovered that you're missing she's terribly upset. She thinks you've been murdered by the thieves. My wife is an incredibly stupid woman. That's extremely competent young man. What's his name, Bateman? Rupert Bateman, commonly known as Pongo. I was at school with him. Bold left arm, deadly seriousness, no sense of humour. That's a pity, gentleman who have no sense of humour get to taking themselves too seriously, and that leads to mischief. Superintendent Battle. Yes Eileen. Don't you think very odd that Sir Oswald was wondering about in the middle of the night in the garden, without explaining himself. Sir Oswald is a great man a great man always knows better than to explain unless an explanation is demanded. But, what I should like to know is just how Miss Wade happened to arrive on the scene so pat. Very convinient. Hhhmm she ought to be ashamed of herself hoodwinking us all as she did. Why should I be kept out of it? I never meant to be. And when when you rang up and said there might be danger I was more determined than ever. So I just came over here to see what was going on. And I was looking around me when plop, something suddenly fell right at my feet. A packet, Miss Wade I think was deliberately thrown down to you, or so I believe. -To me? -Well to the person the thief thought you were. This is getting very involved. Superintendent. One moment please lady Eileen. When you came into the room did you turn the light on sir? -Yes. -Superintendent. If you please lady Eileen. Was anyone in the room? No one at all. Well, there is now. I say. I have water. One moment Lady Eileen, let me handle this. What on earth happened? Obviously, is what I'm trying to find out. Is it the Countess? It's all right, it's really all right. Don't try to talk it's bad for you just just just lie still. Don't say anything till you feel quite all right again. Just just just lie still and close your eyes you'll feel quite alright again in a minute. Hasn't brandy that's not anything Bundle, some brandy will be a good idea? You are crazy Bill leave her alone she'll be all right. I'm here. Take your time. Don't say anything, till you're quite all right again. It is coming back to me. Yes, it is coming back. Have some water. A little brandy perhaps. Tell me please, what has happened? Hoping you might be able to tell us. I. I could not sleep. So I think to myself, perhaps I come downstairs to find a magazine. The house is very still. I come down the stairs quietly. And I come in here. Having, of course, switched on the light? No, no no, no, I did not switch on the light. I had you see, my little electric torch with me. Suddenly I hear something, footstep. So I switch out my torch and I hide behind the screen. Then the door opens. The light is switched on. And the man, the burglar. He is in the room with me. -I say-- -I nearly died of fright, I try not to breathe. The man stands for a moment listening. Then crosses the room to the window. Then I hear him come back again. And he switches out the light and locks the door. Oh dear, I think I'm locked in the room with a monster! Then again, I hear him go to the window. And I think I hope perhaps he's gone out that way. [speaking in a foreign language] It all begins. -What does? -Oh never I shall never forget it. It was horrible. Two men trying to murder each other. Furniture crashing falling about the room. It was horrible. The criminal, he had an evil voice. The other one was cultured English a gentleman I think. He was sweating a lot. Clearly a gentleman. And then a flash and the shot and the bullet must have hit the bookcase beside me. I suppose I must have fainted. You poor dear, how rotten for you. Silly idiot. I'm so glad I've got a cultured English voice. Your arm., it is all tied up. Was it you then? Hhhmm, oh but I can assure you I would never have dreamed of using the language I did. I've had any suspicion there was a lady present. It wasn't a bullet countess, it was a shell of a cartridge. But we should find a bullet somewhere tomorrow. It is absurd, I know but I still feel extremely faint. Let me help you to your room. Bundle will come with you. Thank you very much Lady Eileen. so that I should prefer to be alone. I'm really quite all right. Perhaps you would be so kind as to help me up the stairs. Sure you don't want any help? I'm sure Mr. Eversleigh will be able to give me whatever help I may require. Oh! [dramatic music] Oh, countess, are you all right? I'm looking after her. Dr. Hudson says nothing seriously wrong with O'Rourke, Superintendent. says he'll see you now. Come on, hold my hand nurse. Witness a strong man's agony, you know the stunt. Lady Eileen, whatever's the matter? You look as if you've seen a ghost. Not a ghost Superintendent, a mole. A what? A mole. A mole isn't much to go upon Lady Eileen. And two women might easily have an identical mole. And the Countess is very well known around country. Then this isn't the real countess. Look at tonight, look at the way we found her. I didn't believe she fainted at all. I tell you, superintendent, it's the same woman that I saw at the meeting of The Seven Dials Club. Well, all right she was wearing a wig then or she's wearing one now. It's the same woman I'm sure of it. Lady Eileen, I know to trust you. The countesses conduct is suspiciously suspicious, I know that as well as you too but we've got to make sure. And if you were sure? You've heard the expression respect to catch a macro. Meaning? Don't bother about what I mean Lady Eileen, but remember this, I know all about the Countess. And I want her left alone. I want the man at the top. [bell ringing.] [car engine revving] [eerie music] Here we have the two bullets, the larger, fired from Mr. Thesiger's Colt Automatic embedded itself in the sofa here. Now this little fella fired from the Mauser 7.65 after passing through Mr. Thesiger's arm. grazed the door there and I found it embedded in the trunk of a cider tree. Now, as for the pistol itself-- Any fingerprint? The man who handled it wore gloves, sir. -[Oswald] Pity. -A man who knew his business would wear gloves sir. Am I right in thinking Mr. Oswald that you found this pistol just about 10 yards from the top of the steps leading up to the terrace. Almost exactly, I'd say. It would have been wiser, sir, if you'd left it exactly where it was. I'm sorry. What is your theory of the pistol being there? I presumed it had been dropped by the thief as he ran. Not dropped Sir Oswald. There's only one set of footprints crossing the lawn there, your own. But can you be sure that Battle? Quite sure sir, this pistol was thrown with some force made a dent in the ground. Everything points to this pistol having been thrown from the terrace. Does it really matters, superintendent? We like to get things right you know. I wonder if one of you gender would be so kind as to take this pistol and throw it. Sir Oswald? That's very kind. Would you care to come out here sir? Now if you would be good enough sir to throw the gun as far as you can out onto the lawn there. Thank you Sir Oswald. What's he up to now I wonder? I must say it was a stroke of luck You're being there at the right moment. Right moment? [Thesiger] To find the gun, and in the dark too. I stumbled on it. I didn't sleep very well last night-- That's it just the same sort of mark. Although By the way, you threw it a good 10 yards further. But then you're a very powerfully built man, aren't you, Sir Oswald? I remember I had insomnia one's terrible experience. I don't suffer from insomnia. As a rule, I'm an excellent sleeper. Just last night, I felt unusually restless. I thought the night air might do me good. Well indeed it all seems clear enough to me Battle, the man fires a shot, disabling Mr. Thesiger, flings away the weapon then runs along the terrace and down the gravel path. Where he ought to have been caught by my men. Your men, if I may say so Battle, seem to have been singularly remiss. If they failed to seem Miss Wade coming in. They could miss seeing her coming in. They could just easily miss the thief going out. You can't have it both ways Battle. I mean, either he ran across the lawn, which you say he didn't or he went down the path. Damage all done where else could he have gone? Up the IV again sir. Oh nonsense, if man was trying to escape he wouldn't bolt back into the house. Safest place for him sir. I say what's this? Exhibit Z, the last of our little lot. It is or rather it once was a glove. Where did you find that? In the great, nearly burned but not quite. Looks as if it had been chewed by a dog. [phone ringing] I wonder if, would you be so kind as to. Telephone call for you Superintendent. Will you attach any importance to this discovery superintendent? You never know Sir Oswald, what's going to be important and what isn't. Well, if you'd excuse me gentlemen. Well, even if you're right about the Countess, Bundle, she couldn't have nearly stolen the formula all by herself. She was behind the screen all the time. She said she was behind the screen all the time. It was the man who claimed on the IV -and took a shot at me. -Number Seven! All right, who is Number Seven? I thought of coming to see you you know. After all, we had a lot in common. You'd lost Gerry, who was my friend, and Ronny, was getting rather fond of you, you know. I thought perhaps together we might have found some reason why. What happened happened? Exactly. What do you think happened to them Bill? I discovered something. Connected with the Foreign Office? More complicated than that. But surely if they had they would have shared it with you. They trusted you. Ronny got nearest to it. If only he hadn't. Someone really evil behind this Lorraine. I know it. But you don't know who. Pity my man Stevens isn't Number Seven, he's got the brain for it. Don't be silly Jimmy. Sorry, to tell you the truth, there's only one person I'm sure it isn't Cootes. Eileen! Oh, now look what you've done. I've had a few words with Lady Coote. What with my wound my charming conversation, I have made a complete conquest there. What are you up to? Eileen! What do we know about Number Seven? He's determined, he's used to being obeyed, he has some sort of position which places him above suspicion, and he's ruthless. There's only one person that matches that description. Sir Oswald. I'm gonna find out more about him. My dear Eileen and you don't have to leave as well. Well, I seemed to be the centre of some very curious goings on lately. My father's very worried about me. I think I better go and hold his hand. This little hand will indeed be comforting. Oh, my dear Eileen, in these days of changed and unsettled conditions when family life is at a premium when the old standards are falling. It becomes our class to set an example by showing that dignity, modesty and filial respect do still mean something. Now I will confess my child, my dear dear, child. Now have in the past been somewhat disappointed by your liberty. I now perceive the honest beauty of your mind the butterfly emerging from the chrysalis it would be a great delight to me if I may to help form that budding mind. I have a very interesting new work on political economy. I look it out now and you can take it back to Chimneys with you. Excuse me. When you've finished it, we can discuss it together. Look here, what the hell was Cootes holding your hand for? It wasn't my hand, it was my budding mind. Don't be an ass Bundle. We are going to discuss political economy together. [laughing] You're sure that's all? That's very definitely all. Lady Coote. You know that was an awfully jolly Bree can we had with your Chimneys. Well, it would have been awfully jolly if it hadn't been poor old Gerry, kicking the bucket like that. Jolly nice girls. I find girls very perplexing nowadays. We're not at all romantic you know. Why, I embroided handkerchiefs for Sir Oswald with my own hair when we were engaged. Did you? How marvellous. But I suppose girls don't have long enough hair to do that nowadays. Excuse me. Sir Oswald has sent me to tell you Lady Coote that there's been a change of plan. Mr Lomax has very kindly offered to let us stay on at the Abbey until the palace is ready. He's going to his club. Thank you, Mr. Bateman. It'd be nice to settle in for a few weeks atleast. And the Abbey is a topping place. Don't you think so Pongo? Topping. Abbeys, palaces. Sometimes I wonder when it's all going to end. You should have seen this last we had in Yorkshire Mr.Thesiger. Mr. Oswald was playing Mr. Coot. Such a nice lag all, and a pretty little drawing room with an England oak. but now nothing will suit him but the very best. He's got on and he's got on till he can't stop getting on. He is one of the richest men in England now but does that satisfy him, no. Still he wants more. He wants to be, well, I don't know what he wants to be. I can tell you, it frightens me a little sometimes. Well, now we better make the most of it. I thought you were getting on rather well with that god daughter of mine. Vera? Oh, she's a panic. Are you doing anything this weekend? Nothing I can't cancel. Oh, well then I'll invite her down. And you can come too. A skeleton key sir? All I want to know Stevens, is where one buys them. I regret to say say sir, but for once your inquiry is beyond my cognizance, Very good Stevens. One might venture or comments sir? Venture away. When I came into your service sir, it was as a gentleman's gentleman not as a gentleman burglars gentlemen. There has been no confusion of intent has there sir? None at all. Dammit Stevens if I were a gentlemen burglar I wouldn't be asking you where I might buy a skeleton key would I? I'd have one. I take your point, sir. There is a gentleman of my fraternity who dropped into the mulberry bush of an evening. Yes. In a household of Lord Mount Vernon sir. Answers occasionally near to the Appalachian Southport Pete. He might be able to help. I would be most grateful Stevens if on my behalf you would approach Southport Pete as a matter of some urgency. Very good sir. I need it this weekend. [car engine revving] [eerie music playing] [cheering] Well played Parker. Oh, I'm so sorry, it's the most confounded news since I have to do everything with my left hand. Every child should be taught to ambidextrous. Like seals you mean? I think that's amphibious. Ambidextrous means using either hand equally well. It came up in the times last week as a matter of fact, eight across, double dealing. That was a clue, rather clever I thought. Are you god Pa? Am I what? What Jimmy said, double dealing? Ambidextrous. [Vera] That's it. Certainly I can write with either hand. [Vera] But not with both at once. Would hardly be practical. Yeah, I suppose that'd be a bit too subtle. You'll never make a good player Maria. I know dear you always say so, and that's another pound you owe Mr. Thesiger. I Check those figures we need for Monday sir. I'm afraid you're right. It's an error at the pre assessment stage. Which means we'll have to go through the whole damn report. Where is it? Well, papers in the study sir. In that case, I'd better say good night. This could take till well after midnight. That's all right dear, the young ones will keep me company. Oswald? Thank you sir. Now, what about a lovely game of German wits. Good night all. Good night sir. Mr Thesiger, Would you kindly close the doors? very draughty these old hardboards. My pleasure Lady Coote. [dramatic music] Damn. [dramatic music] My goodness Pongo, you did give me a start, slinking about like that in the dark. Heard a noise, thought burglars have got in. Came down to see. You think of everything Pongo, even a lethal weapon. It is as well to be armed. You never know who you're gonna meet. Well I'm glad you didn't shoot. I'm rather tired of being shot at. I might easily have done so. What did you come down for? I was hungry, I rather fancied a dry biscuit. There are some biscuits on tin by your bed. oh no that's where this staff work has gone wrong old boy, you see there this, a tin with biscuits for starving visitors on it but when the starving visitor opened it, nothing inside, So I just toddled down here to find something and now I think I'll just toddle back to bed. Good night, Pongo. Damn! [dramatic music] I've been thinking. Extraordinary thing about this biscuits. Do you mind if I just... Help yourself, old boy Very remise, good night. [eerie music] So, nothing? Nothing at all. Apart from the most frightful attack of indigestion brought on by too many biscuits. I must say you do seem to have been awfully clever where Pongo was concerned. There's only one word for him. Last week's crossword 10 letters meaning everywhere at once. Ubiquitous. But we are nowhere near Number Seven are we? Not yet, no. Mr. Eversleighs here My lady. -Well-- -Hope you don't mind I had to clear Coote's letters from the Abbey. -I thought I should look in -You couldn't have chosen a better moment, were having a council of war. War? Yes Jimmy spent a thoroughly unprofitable weekend with the Cootes. Mr Oswald is Number Seven? There's not a shred of proof of it. You think he is? Have you got a better suggestion? -Ooh I Know, -Know what? Something I meant to ask you, I nearly forgot. Do you remember that glove the superintendent Battle found the half burnt one? Glove? It had been thrown on the fire. Do you remember he asked you to try it on your hand? What was left of it why? AnD Sir George and Sir Oswald were there two, weren't they? -Yes. -He could have asked either of them to try it on. -Yes ofcourse. -But he didn't and chose you. don't you see what that means? Your right hand was in a sling. Quite true, it was rather odd, now I come to think of it, it being a left handed glove. I mean Battle never said anything. He didn't want to draw attention to it but don't you see what it means? The man who shot it you held the pistol in his left hand. And so Oswald is ambidextrous. We were talking about it last night while playing Bridge. Now all you understand that the Oswald is Number Seven. Oh, but why stage all that comment at the Abbey when he had the formula before then at his own works? Simple, suspicion had to be diverted from him and placed it in another Coote. And he's very good at diverting suspicion. He doesn't have to bother. He walked him through that window, two o'clock in the morning, wearing his dinner jacket, saying he'd been for a walk. What's more, Battle believed him. I wonder. Don't despair my dear child. took me years to perfect me game. I did try this. Yes, yes I know you did my dear. It was a very laudable effort. Mind you, I've always thought if God made Women to play golf. He'd have made them differently. Croquet, Now that's a woman's game, but it criticised a young woman playing croquet that beguiling tilt to the head that graceful curve of the spine, ruin the game when those short skirts came into fashion. what one misses is the provocative into the ankle. [Tredwell clear throws] Mr Lomax is here my Lord. Well tell him I'm not. I'm afraid he saw your lordship practising as he came up the drive. Oh really Tredwell Well, where did you put him? In the drawing room, my Lord. My dear fellow, my dear ,dear fellow. I am delighted to see you, absolutely delighted. I won't beat about the bush. I wanted to see you're particularly, very particularly. About about Eileen. Eileen? Yeah, Eileen. I think if I may say so Caterham, you hardly appreciate the fact that she is no longer a child. Oh, you mean Bundle. Yes. She is a woman and what's more a very charming and talented one. I dare say but she's very restless, you know. Never content to be in the same place for two minutes together. You mean she's not contented to stagnate. She interests herself in the questions of the day and brings her fresh and lively young intellect to bear upon. Now, perhaps my decade from you begin to get some inkling of my purpose in visiting you this morning. But, dear fellow, you can't want to marry Bundle, oh I really shouldn't do that If I were you. Just go home and think about it. There's a good fella can't 20 that sort of thing. Always a pity to go out, proposing and making a fool of yourself. Dare say I mean your advice kindly Caterham but I must confess you do, put it's somewhat strangely, however, I have decided to put my fourtune to the tests have I owe permission to speak to Eileene? It's nothing to do with me my dear chap. Eileen manages her own affairs. If you were to come to me tomorrow and tell me she was getting mad at a chauffeur. I shouldn't make the least objection. Where should I find her? Well, I don't really know, she might be anywhere. As I told you, she's never in the same place for two minutes together. No repos, no repos at all. Not much good for a politician's wife, you know. A politician ought to know where his wife is beside him wearing the right hat, smiling, leading the applause, not tearing around the country in motorcars knocking people down and shooting them might lose you an awful lot of votes. I beg you my dear fellow enjoy your parliamentary career to reconsider. I never reconsider. Eileen's brain and accute political sense cannot help but further my career to our mutual advantage. Well, who knows with her at my side I might even get to Downing Street. Mr. Lomax would like a word with you in the house My Lady. Thanks Tredwell. [laughing] Mr Eversleigh my Lord. Oh Bill my dear chap, looking for poor old George Lomax, I suppose. But if you want to really do a good turn, just pop into the dining room and tell him the cabinet's called an immediate meeting. It's really not fair to let the poor chap makes it an ass himself. I have not come Cootes, its Bundle I want to see. Well you can't see her either, not just now, anyway. George is in there with her. Splattering horribly at this very moment. What he's saying? Oh some damn nonsense I suppose. Never speak too much, that's my motto. Just grab the girl's hand let events take their course. [bill laughs] What course? Shh, he's proposing. Proposing, proposing what? Marriage to Bundle, can't think why. It seems to me that he's reached his second childhood. Second time run too, can't explain it any other way. Proposing to Bundle the dirty swine, at his age? He says he's in the prime of life. But he's decrypted, he's senile. Well, he's just five years younger than I am. [car revving] Hello Bill. I say what's the matter? You don't look your usual bright little self. I'm worried. I was worried anyway, but something turned up for give me a jolt. There's anything very extraordinary happened William? Something damned odd. I can't make head or tail of it. Seven Dial's business? The Seven Dial's business I am... I got a letter this morning. What sort of a letter? A letter from Ronny Devereux executives, it seems he left instructions if... If he was to die suddenly, a certain sealed envelope was to be sent to me exactly a fortnight after his death. And they've sent it to you? Yes. And you've opened it? Yes. [Jimmy chuckles] Well what did it say? Oh come on old chap, pull yourself together it seems to have knocked the wind out of you whatever it is. Uh, have a drink. It's what's in the letter. Simply can't believe it, that's all. [Jimmy laughs] Nonsense. You must get into the habit of believing six impossible things before breakfast. Like the White Queen and Alice, I do it regularly. Wait a minute. [Steven singing in foreign language] I say Stevens. Yes Sir? Pop out and get me some cigarettes, would you? 100 sir? Thank you Stevens. I've sent Stevens out so we can talk undisturbed. Now then Bill, let's hear all about it. It's incredible. Oh, thank goodness I've caught you. Look, I haven't got time to explain everything but bill is just run to see me with the most amazing story you've ever heard. [Bundle] Bill? Yes, now listen, this is what you'll have to do. Come up to town at once, go straight to the Seven Dials Club and get rid of that footman fella. Alfred, you leave that to me, Then watch out for me and Bill. Don't show yourself at the windows, but as soon as we drive up let us in at once. Wish I knew what it was all about? I'll explain when we meet. And I'll tell you this much. We're going to get ready to hell of a surprise for Number Seven. Alfred I've come to warn you, the police are looking for you. There's a warrant out for Mr. Mosgorovsky, and the best thing you can do is clear out as quick as you can. Here's ten pounds to help you get away. I should say you about exactly three minutes. Oh my lady. [car engine revving] However do I thank you my lady? One good turn deserves another. Well I would have arranged that All right. Was it necessary to be well quite so drastic? Safer. I don't know what Jimmy and Bill are up to and we don't want Alfred coming back in the middle of it and wrecking everything. Oh they've wasted no time, they are here! I'll open the door for them. Stop there a moment Bill. Blow the horn if you think anyone's watching the place. There you are you two. Now then, where's the key of the room you got into last time? I think its through here. This looks like the one. All right. There's no time to lose. It's through here. [dramatic music] This is the getaway door. So, this must be the cupboard you hid in Bundle. [Bundle] That's the one. We shall have to shift all this stuff. Run down and get Bill wiggling around. There's no need for him to keep watching any longer. What are you going to do? Wait till Bill comes you shall hear the whole story. This is his staff work, a jolly creditable bit of work it is too. I say, it must have been a bit of a squeeze in here wasn't it? Certainly wasn't an experience I get to repeat. Bundle, it Bill, its Bill! -What about Bill? -Ms Lorraine, what happened? He's in the car still but he doesn't move or speak. I think he's dead. In Gods name! [upbeat music] I don't understand it. But he's not dead. Look here we've got to get him inside. Goodness, no policeman comes along. He was alright when I left him. I suppose we should have realised we couldn't turn up on their doorstep, without something happening. Look, I'm going to go Doctor. You stay here and look after him. Don't be scared, either of you. But I better leave you, Leopold. Just in case. I'll be back as soon as I possibly can. I wish I could do something, this is awful. I wonder why Jimmy left us the revolver, they can't really be danger. If they go get Bill. I know but we're in the house. Nobody can get in without our hearing them. I wish I knew what to do. Hot Coffee, you give them that sometimes. I got some smelling salts in my bag and some brandy. I must have left in the room upstairs. You stay here I'll get it. Try patting his face, gently. [dramatic music] Darling Bundle. She's dead, I know she's dead. Oh my darling Bundle, I do love you so. Bundle, Oh my darling one. Oh my own dearest, sweetest little Bundle. What shall I do, Oh God what shall I do, I've killed her, I've killed her. No, you haven't you silly idiot. Bundle, you're alive. Of course I'm alive. For how long have you been? I mean, when did you come to? About five minutes ago. Why didn't you open your eyes or say something? I didn't want to, I was enjoying myself. Enjoying yourself. Listening to all those nice things you were saying. You'll never say them so nicely again, you'll be to beastly self conscious. You really didn't mind? You know, I do love you so. I have done for ages, I never dare tell you so. You silly jugghead, just lie. I thought you'd only laugh at me. Bundle, seriously, could you ever? Could you ever bring yourself to? Could I ever bring myself to what? Change your mind and marry me instead of that fatuos ass Cootes. You think I'd marry a fool like that. You mean, you haven't? You don't? I haven't and I don't. Then please marry me my own darling Bundle. I know I'm awfully thick headed but I do love you so. Oh Bill! [both exclaim] Do lets be sensible I got a rocking head and I've been nearly squeezed to death by you. I want to get the hang of things now. Where are we and what's happened? We are locked in the upper room at the Seven Dials and you are not going to believe what's happened. If you do believe it, you're certainly not going to like it. Why, what has happened? I better just tell you. [soft music] I have sent Stevens out so we can talk undisturbed. Now then Bill, let's hear all about it. It's incredible. Well then it should be true. In this letter, Ronny said that he was almost certain that he discovered the identity of the person who had been selling this country's secrets to the highest bidder. He said that if anything happened to him and his lawyers forwarded the letter to me, I would know for sure that his suspicions were correct his death would prove it. When we all went down the Chimneys that weekend, Gerry Wade told Ronny that he was almost sure he knew it was but he, he didn't name the person. And Gerry was murdered. Ronny was sure he'd been murdered, by a member of the house party. That's why he fixed up that trick with the seven clocks on the mantelpiece. He got us all in there one by one, and Ronny was murdered. Ronny also said that he was on the point of confiding in you, but something held him back. In the letter, he names the person he suspected. I see about Jeff. That's why, I've come to you. I want you to tell me it isn't true. I've said Bill, you must learn to believe six impossible things before breakfast. Like, why Ronny's last words were, "Seven Dials. "Tell Jimmy Thesiger." Exactly like that. Getting sleepy? It Won't be long before you're all together again. Ronny, and Gerry. And good old Bill. You should be dead, why aren't you dead? I only look an ass. I pulled the drink away while he was out of the room. He's out there now doing what? Planning what? He thinks you're dead, and I'm nearly died. He won't stop there. He'll get what he wants. Not if I can help it darling. [eerie music] [Lorraine] Are you sure it's all right? Oh yes, I hit her pretty hard. -Are they-- -well on the way. But holding Bill upstairs has done my wounded arm, not good at all. He's such a dead weight, as you might say. Come on help me. What are you going to do? -Open the cupboard door -why? 10 down, seven letters, walled-in for good, answer? I don't know. Immured, hold him steady. It was, clever of you to cock on. I knew you'd left the gun in case I needed it. And when you slammed the front door I knew you had left the house. How? Don't I always know when you're near. There. That should make a charming surprise for The Seven Dials. Pity, I liked bundle. Oh I liked her too until she started snooping. Too much initiative. Not good for a girl. [Lorraine] I liked Bill too. More than me? No one more than you, ever. Well now all we have to do, is watch this house and wait. I don't care how long it takes. But someday the Seven Dials will meet again. And I shall find out at last the real identity of Number Seven. I should hate to keep you waiting, Mr. Thesiger. [eerie music] One move, any of you, this is trained on your precious Number Seven. And I will use it. Oh he will use it but not until his curiosity has been satisfied. If you have been waiting for me, Mr. Thesiger, I for my part have been waiting for you. A man who kills as likely and ruthlessly as you do. And for what reason? Profit? Isn't that your motive too? But your kind of profit Mr. Thesiger, [Jimmy laughs] Oh, you don't think I did it just for money, do you? Although I must admit it made life a lot more pleasant. No. [soft music] I did it, for pleasure. Something to make the blood tingle. Everyone thinking what a jolly, nice, young man. What an ass. What I really enjoyed, what I loved, was manipulating everybody. Making events fall into patterns, my patterns and always getting my own way. [laughing] And now, I'm going to get my own way, once again. I'm going to rip that mask off your face Number Seven, and then I'm going to you can kill you. You can't kill us all. Only you, the rest of them can wait. Come here Number Seven. Come here! Who are you? Who do you work for? What do you want? That's something you will never know. [upbeat music] I always said you were a fool. But not as you hoped and drugged fool, you really should have thought of something a little different this time. But it took a long time for you to work it out, didn't it? [laughs] Oh and you, never even began to suspects did you? No. All right. So they've got me, but one thing still gives me enormous pleasure. The Seven Dials have got you too. Take him away. What are you going to do to him? An eye for an eye. [eerie music] Lady Eileen Brent, you've been summoned to emergency meeting of The Seven Dials, approach the table. I should do as they say if I were you. Lady Eileen, you have been present and asked at the secret councils of this society. It is therefore necessary that you identify yourself with our aims and ambitions. The place two o'clock you may notice is vacant. It is that place that is offered you now. I'd rather die. I think you should not answer precipitately. You do not know as yet what you're refusing. I can make a pretty good guess I doubt it. You'll have to get rid of one or two preconceived ideas of yours, I'm afraid, about this Society for instance. You're just as evil as James Thesiger. You merely have different methods of achieving the same goal. No Lady Eileen, you're wrong. I shall now introduce you to a very creditable band of amateurs who have done work, that nobody else could have done. They've been willing to face real danger. Danger, the very worst kind. And they've done it for one reason, an honest wish to serve their country. First of all, there is Mr. Mosgorovsky who as you know runs this club. He is the most valuable antibody service agent in England. Number Five is Count Andras of the Hungarian embassy and a dear friend of the late Gerald Wade. Four, Mr. Howard Phelps, an American journalist whose nose for scenting news is remarkable. Number three I think, you already know. You! Number two, can only show an empty place. It is the place belonging to Mr. Ronny Devereux. A very gallant young man, who died for his country. Number one. Well, number one, was Mr. Gerald Wade who made the same sacrifice. His place has been taken by a lady who has proved her fitness to have it. I don't think lady Eileen recognises me. Bundle, may I introduce Miss Barbara Simpmore. Ronny's cousin, and one of our most talented young actresses. I was right about that mole. I should have to remember that next time. You can change your skin your voice your hair, but a mole never. It's no good, I'm completely bewildered. I suppose they all know who you are? No, Mr. Mosgorovsky is my left hand, he's known all along. The others have taken their orders from him. [soft music] Do I want to know who you are? Hope you do, lady Eileen. Superintendent Battle! [chattering indistinctively] It was Gerry Wade who first suggested to me the idea of a band of amateurs. Remember what you said yourself, lady Eileen. "People who could go, where the professionals couldn't." I warned him it would be dangerous, but he didn't care nor did any of his friends. And that's how it began. But the fact that the Seven Dials finally caught up with a one man they wanted most in the world is entirely due to the courage of Mr. Eversleigh. He went to see Mr. Thesiger this afternoon knowing full well that he might never return from that interview alive. What made you suspect him? Little things as far as the built up gradually. He's angling for an invitation at the Abbey started it. It was actually the Lorraine, that maybe certain I was that I was on the right track. But when I went to talk to her she, she listened so carefully to what I had to say but never, never actually said anything herself. And that made me think of Gerry and Ronny. They had confided in her too. Then when I saw the three of you that day Chimneys, I saw Jimmy wandering around with his arm in his sling, I started just voted that left handed glove. Suppose he'd been the person wearing it all along. But it all started with Ronny Devereux last words. Seven Dials, Tell-- Who, tell who? Tell Jimmy Thesiger. Naturally you took that to mean that Mr. Devereaux was trying to send word to Mr Thesiger. That the Seven Dials had killed him. But of course, I knew that couldn't be so. No, its the Seven Dials that Mr. Devereaux wanted told, and what he wanted them told was something about Mr. Thesiger. That Jimmy Thesiger killed Gerry wade. He slipped the poison into a whiskey and soda, which Mr. Wade had downstairs before retiring to bed. Cheers. Cheers. [Battle] That's why he was already feeling sleepy when he wrote that letter. Later when everyone was asleep and the alarm clocks were in position, same Thesiger pressed the unconscious Gerry Wade's fingers round a glass, and an empty choral bottle, and left them by his bed. The result. Death by misadventure. [Battle] Then Ronny Devereaux made the fatal mistake. He confided in the one person who had already given Gerry Wade away. Lorraine, devoted body and soul to James Thesiger, she was prepared to sacrifice her half brother. And later, Ronny Devereux. So, when are going to arrest Sir Oswald? Sir Oswald? Well Jimmy Thesiger couldn't have tried to steal the formula. Number Seven didn't try to steal the formula. That leaves only one person who could have tried to steal the formula. I knew it was him when he came in from the garden that night. Who? Sir Oswald of course. [Battle] No, Lady Eileen it wasn't Sir Oswald. Who was it then? Tell me what you saw, what you heard. Well, I went to look for Jimmy, when I saw the door knob turn, [dramatic music] So, I ran to Bill, and then the fire broke out. [Battle] Bill Eversleigh. Miss Moore and I decided to keep watching between us. She was stationed in the drawing room and like Bundle I heard the fighting came running. Miss Simpmore. I was hiding behind the screen when James Thesiger came in. I thought he'd gone when the fight started, I was in the garden under some trees. When Miss Wade ran straight into my arms. We heard the fight, we heard two shots. We all had that. Because that's what we were meant to hear. I didn't understand You will. Miss Simpmore, how many people were fighting? Two. -How do know that? -Well, I heard them. Did you see them? -No. -No. Now listen and I'll tell you how in the end I reconstructed the whole story. To begin with Miss Wade and Mr. Thesiger were in this together. Have a rendezvous for the precise time, 2 AM. So let's go back 10 minutes before that. Miss Wade arrives in her car, parks in the lane and makes her way across the garden towards the West Wing. [soft music] She was seen by one of my men, but he had orders not to stop anyone coming in, only going out. And so Miss Wade makes her way towards the house. Now we come, to Mr. Thesiger. After the lights were turned out Miss Simpmore said that when James Thesiger went over to the window, he was so still, she thought he must have left the room Suppose then that Mr.Thesiger, had gone outside. [dramatic music] Where next? Up the IV, into Mr. O'Rourke's room. O'Rourke, heaviley drugged before he went to bed. Miss Wade near the house Lady Eileen in the West Wing, and me, in the garden. [bell ringing] Mr. Thesiger, has the formula. He throws it down to a Miss Wade. She picks it up and starts running back to her car. While upstairs, Lady Eileen sees the door handle turn. Mr. Thesiger is turn it, trying to find the easy way out. But the key is under O'Rourke pillow. [dramatic music] James Thesiger comes back down the IV. Lady Eileen is desperate to find Bill Eversleigh, Miss Wade is running away from the house. But who does she meet? Me. At that moment the game changes it is no longer attack but defence. Miss Wade tells her story, she's very clever. Her stories perfectly true, perfectly sensible, and it gives Mr Thesiger time to get back into the house. [soft music] Where he proceeds to fight himself, You see he has to establish an enemy. His own Automtic, bought the day before, is fired at an imaginary assailant. The Countess knows to what effect, you all heard it? Then Thesiger plays his masterstroke. With this gloved left hand he takes the Mauser and shoots himself in the right arm I heard the shots, Miss Wade heard them, we ran to the house. James Thesiger now only has a few seconds. He frames the pistol from the terrace, Tears off the glove with his teeth, and throws it in the fire. When we arrived he was lying on the floor, in a faint. So that's how he did it. And I thought it was poor lid Sir Oswald. I never really suspected him. But I must say I did have my suspicions about that young chap his secretary, particularly when I heard he was left handed too. That gun had to be thrown left handed to land where it did. Not as silly ass like old Pongo, not a solemn card like him. Oh, Pongo, as you call him is a very efficient young man and one that could put anything through the mind to it. In fact, I think we should bear him in mind in case there's ever another vacancy. Unless of of course, there is one now. Count me in. I'm ready for anything I say, should you be drinking? Let I'll let him die after what happened to your head? Very good for the head champagne Perhaps you should put slowly all over myself. You shouldn't go around letting people hit you over the head you know Bundle you really shouldn't it's very bad for the brain. [Bundle] It was Bill who hit her the second time And why did you hit her? Usually all you have to do is to speak to her. She's perfectly amenable Yes, why did you hit me? There was no time to explain I couldn't of run the risk of your not being able to keep quiet it might have been the end of both of us. It hasn't made you change your mind has it? [soft music] Sir, I know this gonna come a bit of a shock, and I'm simply rotten golfer, but may I marry your daughter. My child I welcome you with open arms. Anything to keep her out of the clutches of that damn fool George Lomax. [all laugh] This calls for a toast. What's your name again? Bill Sir You're not the one she ran over. Father. Bundle, Bill to your future. [soft music] Sir, there's only one thing, something it's always puzzled me. Why she called Bundle? You will find out my dear boy, you will find out. [soft bright music]
