FROM THE 81st FLOOR HERE UP TO 120, IT'S EXCLUSIVELY RESIDENTIAL. THE APARTMENT I WANT TO SHOW YOU IS 8145. SAY, BILL, TUNE IN THE MAIN UTILITY ROOM. O.K. SOMETHING'S SCREWED UP. THE SENSOR DIDN'T TRIP THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ALARM. WHY SHOULD IT? YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF... THERE'S NO FIRE. WELL, THE SENSOR INDICATES THERE IS. PLUS WES JUST CALLED. THEY'RE HAVING WIRING PROBLEMS. YOU BETTER STAY WITH IT. I WANT YOU UP THERE WITH ME. WE CAN DO GOOD THINGS TOGETHER. WHAT'S THE MATTER? HELLO? DAVE'S LEAVING. THEY'VE OFFERED ME MANAGING EDITOR. OH, THAT'S NICE. I MEAN... WELL, I GUESS WE GOT OURSELVES A SITUATION. IT SEEMS. SEE, DOUG, I WANT THE KIND OF LIFE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, A PLACE WHERE OUR KIDS CAN RUN AROUND, GROW AND BE FREE. BUT? I WANT THIS JOB. I'VE WANTED IT FOR FIVE YEARS. I'VE WORKED FOR IT FOR FIVE YEARS. NOW SUDDENLY IT'S THERE. YOU SEE, I HAVE IDEAS, DOUG. I CAN DO SOMETHING WITH IT, SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE BEFORE. I GUESS I WANT BOTH, AND I CAN'T HAVE BOTH. CAN I? I DON'T KNOW. YEAH. WHERE? I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. LET'S HOLD THIS OFF TILL TONIGHT, HMM? WHAT HAPPENED? WE KICKED ON THE AUXILIARY, AND THIS SHORTED OUT. POWER OFF? YEAH. WHAT ABOUT THAT? IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONDUIT. GIVE ME A PAIR OF DIKES. I KNOW. I KNOW. CALLAHAN CALLED ME. NOW, JUST HOW BAD IS IT? DEPENDS ON HOW GOOD YOUR IMAGINATION IS. JESUS CHRIST! THE SPECS CALLED FOR CONDUIT SAFETY COVERING. HOW MANY FUSE TERMINALS DID YOU CHECK? HOW MANY DO I HAVE TO? YEAH. MR. BIGELOW'S HERE, SIR. O.K. SEND HIM IN. NOW, DOUG, ONE PIECE OF SCORCHED WIRE FROM A BURNED-OUT CIRCUIT BREAKER IS HARDLY CONCLUSIVE. MAYBE NOT, BUT AFTER THAT, I'M WORRIED WHAT OTHER SHOCKS WE'RE IN FOR. WILL... DOUG, J.D... WAIT TILL YOU SEE THIS. WHAT HAPPENED, SOMEBODY HANG THE WALLPAPER UPSIDE DOWN? WE HAVE AN EQUIPMENT PROBLEM. NO PROBLEM IN THE TOWER, IS THERE? COULD BE. COME ON. YOU'RE JUST GUESSING. ALL RIGHT, I AM, BUT I WANT TO TALK TO YOUR SON-IN-LAW. O.K. GET ME ROGER SIMMONS. YES, SIR. WE'LL CHECK THIS THING OUT, MR. DUNCAN. WE'RE ALL GOING TO CHECK IT OUT. I'M MISSING SOMETHING. WE DAMN NEAR HAD A FIRE. YEAH. A FIRE. IN THIS BUILDING? COME ON. WE HAVEN'T EVEN FINISHED INSTALLING THE SAFETY EQUIPMENT. THE PARTY SHOULD'VE BEEN PUT OFF. HOLD IT, WILL. EVERYBODY'S OVERREACTING. YES? MR. SIMMONS IS OUT, SIR. OUT WHERE? THEY DON'T KNOW, BUT I LEFT WORD FOR HIM TO CALL. O.K. WE'LL TALK TO ROGER TOMORROW, AND THEN WE'LL DECIDE WHAT TO DO. THAT'S O.K., ISN'T IT? NO. IT WON'T WAIT. TRY ZONE ONE AGAIN. DAMN IT, HARRY, THIS IS TOP PRIORITY. WE'VE GOT TO GET THESE ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS BACK UP. OUR WHOLE SECURITY PROGRAM'S LOUSED UP WITHOUT THEM. DON'T GO AWAY. DOUG! WELL, WHAT A SURPRISE! WHERE'S THAT ELECTRICAL GENIUS OF YOURS? I'VE CALLED HIS OFFICE, THE CLUB, THE MARINA, EVERYWHERE... NO LUCK. WHAT'S HE DONE? COME ON. I'LL GET YOU A DRINK. HE MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING, 'CAUSE MY FATHER CALLED. I HAVEN'T HEARD HIM THAT UPSET IN YEARS. YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE HE IS? WELL, MY HUSBAND'S TERRITORY RANGES RATHER WIDELY. IT'S ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO THAT OF THE TIMBER WOLF... ANYWHERE WITHIN A 50-MILE RADIUS. BUT IF YOU WANT TO WAIT, HE'LL SHOW UP. HE HAS TO. HIS CLOTHES ARE HERE. CAN I GET YOU A DRINK? NO, THANKS. I GUESS YOU DON'T PLAN TO TELL ME WHAT ROGER'S DONE. HI, DOUG. HONEY. HELLO. WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING THESE DAYS? NOTHING RIGHT NOW. WELL, WELCOME BACK FROM THE WILDERNESS. TO WHAT DO WE OWE THE PLEASURE? CALLAHAN WAS TESTING A BACKUP GENERATOR. THERE WAS A POWER SURGE AND A SYSTEMS FAILURE. HOW CAN THAT BE? IT CAN'T BE, THEORETICALLY. UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN SCREWING AROUND WITH THE ELECTRICAL SPECIFICATIONS. THAT'S BEING RATHER BLUNT, ISN'T IT? YOU BETCHA. YOU'LL UNDERSTAND MY BEING EQUALLY BLUNT. WHAT THE HELL BUSINESS IS IT OF YOURS? I'M WONDERING WHAT KIND OF KICKBACKS WERE INVOLVED. I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE CRAP FROM YOU. WE HAD AN ELECTRICAL FLARE-UP IN THE MAIN UTILITY ROOM. IT SEEMS THAT WIRING WASN'T WHAT I ASKED FOR. EVERY PIECE OF WIRE IN THAT BUILDING IS STRICTLY UP TO CODE. CODE'S NOT ENOUGH FOR THAT BUILDING. I ASKED FOR INSTALLATIONS THAT WERE WAY ABOVE STANDARD. YOU LIVE IN A DREAM WORLD. I DEAL IN REALITIES. I WANT YOUR WIRING DIAGRAMS AND COPIES OF YOUR WORK ORDERS. THAT WOULD TAKE WEEKS, AND SOMEONE WITH MORE CLOUT THAN YOU TO MAKE ME DO IT. IN MY OFFICE. TOMORROW, 9:00. THEY SAY HE USED TO WRESTLE GRIZZLY BEARS IN MONTANA. OF COURSE HE WAS YOUNGER THEN, PROBABLY IN BETTER CONDITION. YOU MUST HAVE ENJOYED ALL THIS IMMENSELY. NO, I DIDN'T. ACTUALLY, I'M DEPRESSED FOR BOTH OF US. WHAT DID YOU EXPECT ME TO DO, PUNCH HIM IN THE NOSE? ROGER, IF YOU'VE DONE ANYTHING TO DAD'S BUILDING, GOD HELP YOU. I DON'T NEED GOD'S HELP, OR YOUR OLD MAN'S. NOT ANYMORE. SO DON'T EXPECT ME TO SHAKE EVERY TIME DADDY BARKS, EVEN IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO. ALL I WANT IS THE MAN I THOUGHT I MARRIED. BUT I GUESS WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF REASONS TO STAY MARRIED, AREN'T WE? IT'S GETTING LATE. WE MUSTN'T MISS THE PARTY. STAND BACK, PLEASE! GIVE ME A WIDE CAMERA ANGLE. STAND BACK, PLEASE. EVERYBODY, BACK OF THE ROPES. HI. 7:30 SHARP. I HOPE YOU LIKE YOUR MEN PROMPT. AT MY AGE? I ONLY CARE THAT THEY SHOW UP. OH, NONSENSE. YOU BE A GOOD GIRL, ELKE. I LEFT YOU SOME MILK IN THE KITCHEN. DID YOU FIND SIMMONS? YEAH, I FOUND HIM. DID HE OR DIDN'T HE CHANGE YOUR SPECS? HE DIDN'T ADMIT IT, BUT I BET HE DID. PAYOFFS AND KICKBACKS, THAT'S THE ONLY WAY HE COULD HAVE SWUNG IT. WELL... HERE YOU ARE. YOUR ORIGINAL SPECS. ZONE ONE ONLY, BUT WE GOT TO START SOMEWHERE. THE SON OF A BITCH GAVE US AN IMPOSSIBLE JOB. SUSAN. HELLO, DAN. GOOD SHOW. HOW ARE YOU, DEAR? JIM, CONGRATULATIONS.

WE BETTER GET DOWN TO 81 AND CHECK THE RELAY SYSTEM. THEY TURNED ON EVERYTHING IN THE WHOLE BUILDING. THERE'S SOMETHING ON 81.

DUNC, IF THAT FIRE WAS CAUSED BY FLUKY WIRING, WE COULD GET FIRES BREAKING OUT EVERYWHERE! DOUG, I THINK YOU'RE OVERREACTING. NOW, I FEEL SORRY FOR WILL GIDDINGS, BUT HE'LL BE TAKEN CARE OF. I'M NOT GOING TO CONCERN MYSELF WITH A FIRE ON 81. IT CAN'T POSSIBLY AFFECT US UP HERE, NOT IN THIS BUILDING. HAVE SOMEONE CALL ME WHEN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVES. MEANWHILE, GET INTO YOUR DINNER JACKET AND COME JOIN THE PARTY. COME ON! WHAT BUILDING'S ON THE CORNER OF MONTGOMERY AND... OH, JESUS. THE GLASS TOWER. WHAT? THE GLASS TOWER! I SURE HOPE THAT FIRE'S ON THE FIRST FLOOR. DID YOU EVER FIGHT ONE IN A HIGH RISE? YEAH. IS IT AS ROUGH AS I HEAR? IT'S LIKE BEING INSIDE A CHIMNEY. PEOPLE! HELL, THEY GOT HERE BEFORE WE DID.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I'M SORRY. YOU'LL HAVE TO MOVE BACK INTO THE PROMENADE ROOM. WE'LL BE TAKING YOU DOWN BY THE SCENIC ELEVATOR. THESE EXPRESS ELEVATORS CAN BE ACTIVATED BY FIRE.

I'M SORRY. PATTY! THERE'S STILL A CHANCE WE CAN GET OUT. ROGER, DIDN'T YOU HEAR WHAT MY FATHER SAID? WE CAN'T GET OUT THAT WAY. ARE YOU COMING OR NOT? NO. IF YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR PERMISSION TO SAVE YOUR OWN LIFE, GO AHEAD. I'M GETTING OUT. ROGER, YOU... AAH! COME ON! COME ON! LET'S GO. YOU GUYS, HOSE THE CEILING. YOU TWO, IN THERE! I GUESS YOU THOUGHT I STOOD YOU UP. IT CROSSED MY MIND. YOU SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT? MM-HMM. DOUG, THOSE HELICOPTERS... THEY'LL GET US OUT, WON'T THEY? SURE, THEY WILL, IF THERE'S NOT TOO MUCH WIND. SOME PARTY. DOUG... HMM. ♪ TA-DUM ♪♪ CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE? NO? DAMN! THE CHOPPERS ARE HERE, BUT THOSE HIGH WINDS MAKE LANDING TOO RISKY. GET SOME MEN ON THE PEERLESS BUILDING. GET A BREECHES BUOY TO THE PROMENADE ROOM. WE CAN'T SHOOT A LINE THAT DISTANCE. SHOOT IT FROM A CHOPPER. I'LL GET ON IT. DON? CHIEF, THE CEILING FELL ON HIM. HE WAS COVERED WITH HOT STUFF. PRETTY RIDICULOUS SPECTACLE, RIGHT? THERE'S NO WAY DOWN. THANK GOD YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. ROGER, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? I KNOW WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. GET QUIETLY DRUNK. IF YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS, I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FEELING. YOU DON'T KNOW THE MEANING OF THE WORD. RESPONSIBLE? FEELING! YOU KNOW ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY. IT'S A FAMILY TRAIT. DUNCANS ARE BIG ON RESPONSIBILITY, AT LEAST ON THE SURFACE. THAT'S NOT FAIR! I DON'T THINK IT'S WRONG TO FEEL A SENSE OF DUTY. SOMETIMES, WHEN YOU TURN THE EXACT SAME PHRASE, LIFT AN EYEBROW THE SAME WAY, I SEE AND I HEAR YOUR FATHER. THE TWO OF YOU... ONE! A GREAT BIG TREE, WITH A BABY TREE IN ITS SHADE. ROGER, I CAME OVER HERE TO YOU BECAUSE I... I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED ME. RIGHT NOW... WHAT I NEED MOST... IS THIS. I... I PROMISED MYSELF IF I EVER SAW YOU AGAIN, I'D MAKE A FULL CONFESSION. NO. BUT THANK YOU. BUT YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ME. BUT I DO. YOU'RE PENNILESS, YOU HAVE NO VILLA IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE, NO ANTIQUES COMING, NO PAINTINGS. BUT, HARLEE, I DON'T CARE. I'M A CHEAP TINHORN. A TWO-BIT CON MAN. NOT CHEAP. MAYBE UNSUCCESSFUL. BUT DON'T YOU SEE? YOUR HEART ISN'T IN IT. HOW CAN YOU CHEAT PEOPLE IF YOU DON'T ENJOY CHEATING? I BROUGHT YOU UP HERE TONIGHT TO SELL YOU 1,000 SHARES IN GREATER ANAHEIM POWER & LIGHT. IS IT A GOOD INVESTMENT? THERE IS NO GREATER ANAHEIM POWER & LIGHT. ONLY THE CERTIFICATE I HAD PRINTED. I THINK YOU'D HAVE ADMIRED THE ARTWORK. BEAUTIFUL ENGRAVING. I'D LIKE TO SEE IT. IT'S IN MY JACKET. I TOOK THE JACKET OFF. IT WAS NEEDED ELSEWHERE. YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN? I CAN'T EVEN DELIVER A PHONY STOCK CERTIFICATE. DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID? EVERY WORD. WELL, THEN TELL ME YOU'RE SHOCKED... OR AT LEAST DISAPPOINTED. I'M NOT. YOU MUST BE! HARLEE, I'M NOT. O.K. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. GIVE ME A FEW MINUTES WITH DOUG, DEAR. SURE. WILL GIDDINGS IS DEAD. HE DIED 20 MINUTES AGO. OH, BOY. OH, I WONDER HOW MANY MORE WILL BE DEAD BY TOMORROW. I THOUGHT WE WERE BUILDING SOMETHING WHERE PEOPLE COULD WORK, LIVE, AND BE SAFE! IF YOU HAD TO CUT COSTS, WHY DIDN'T YOU CUT FLOORS INSTEAD OF CORNERS? NOW, LISTEN... ANY DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE FOR THE USE OF ALTERNATE MATERIALS WERE MADE BECAUSE I, AS A BUILDER, HAVE A RIGHT TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS IF I REMAIN WITHIN THE BUILDING CODE, AND GODDAMN IT, I DID! THE BUILDING CODE. JESUS. THE BUILDING CODE, COME ON. THAT'S A STANDARD COP-OUT WHEN YOU'RE IN TROUBLE. I CRAWLED AROUND UP THERE. DUCT HOLES WEREN'T FIRE STOPPED! CORRIDORS WITHOUT FIRE DOORS, THE SPRINKLERS WON'T WORK. AND AN ELECTRICAL SYSTEM THAT'S GOOD FOR WHAT? I MEAN, IT'S GOOD FOR STARTING FIRES. WHERE WAS I WHEN THIS WAS GOING ON? I'M JUST AS GUILTY AS YOU AND YOUR GODDAMN SON-IN-LAW. WHAT DO THEY CALL IT WHEN YOU KILL PEOPLE? COME ON, MOVE IT! O.K., WHO IS IT? IT'S CHIEF O'HALLORHAN. WHAT HAPPENED? PART OF THE CENTRAL CORE BLEW. WE GOT IN THE FIFTH ALARM. THE HELICOPTERS. IT'S TOO WINDY TO LAND. THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO SET THE BREECHES BUOY UP ON THE PEERLESS BUILDING. WHAT CAN WE DO? MOVE ALL YOUR COMBUSTIBLE MATERIAL AWAY FROM THE WINDOWS. O.K. GOTCHA. NOBODY'S ON THOSE DRAPES. RIGHT. LET'S GET ON IT. GIVE ME A HAND. DID YOU REACH HER? THE PHONES ARE ALL OUT. JUST A LITTLE WHILE LONGER, AND WE'LL ALL BE HOME TOGETHER. IF ONLY I COULD'VE TALKED TO HER, LET HER KNOW WE'VE BEEN THINKING OF HER. TOLD HER HOW... HOW PRECIOUS SHE IS TO US. SHE'S STILL SUCH A CHILD. SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE I KEEP THE KEY TO THE SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX. HOW WILL SHE BE ABLE TO GET INTO IT? I MEAN, UH... IF SHE SHOULD HAVE TO. THE THINGS YOU THINK OF. YOU WANT TO HELP ME? HERE HE IS. CHIEF, WIND VELOCITY'S DOWN A LITTLE. WE'RE GOING TO TRY FOR A LANDING. BILL, GET ROBERTS. YEAH. GET 10 PEOPLE ON THE ROOF. HAVE THE REST STAND BY FOR AIRLIFTING.

WE'LL SEND THE KIDS FIRST, AND THEN THE WOMEN. NUMBER THESE UP TO 100 OR SO. HIGH-RISE ROULETTE. HIGH-RISE ROULETTE. THAT'S RIGHT. DOUG, THERE MAY NOT BE TIME TO TELL YOU... THERE WILL BE. I'LL GO TELL EVERYBODY. PASS THOSE OUT WHEN YOU'RE READY. IT'S GOING TO BE WINDY, ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT CHOPPER LANDS. EVERYBODY STAY IN ONE GROUP. STAY BACK! STAY BACK! LOOK OUT! PAULA! PAULA! DAVID!

WE'LL TRY SHOOTING A LINE FROM A CHOPPER. O.K. HEY, YOU GUYS GOT A PAIR OF CLIPPERS? UH, YEAH. SURE. WHAT FOR? I WANT TO TRY SOMETHING. STEP WAY BACK. THEY'RE GOING TO KNOCK OUT THE WINDOWS. STEP BACK. OH... COULD I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE? WE'VE ACTIVATED A GRAVITY BRAKE ON THAT OUTSIDE ELEVATOR. THERE'S NO POWER TO RETURN IT, BUT WE CAN GET 12 PEOPLE DOWN TO THE STREET. WHICH 12? THE SAME GROUP FROM THE ROOF, AND TWO ADDITIONS... THE WOMAN WHO SAVED THE CHILDREN'S LIVES AND A FIREMAN. I WANT A TRAINED MAN IN THERE. ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE OUT. MARGE. HERE, TAKE THIS. YOU CAN GET OUT OF HERE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M SORRY. I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE. SO YOU CAN STOP WORRYING? WHAT ABOUT ME WORRYING? IT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN HELP ME. HELP ME. IF YOU ASK ME TO GO TO THE NORTH POLE, OR EVEN THE CLIFFS OF MENDOCINO, I'D GO. WHAT IF I ASK YOU TOMORROW? PLEASE. MA'AM, I'LL TAKE HER. COME ON, PHILLIP. ALL RIGHT. I'LL NEVER LET YOU GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT ME AGAIN. I DON'T WANT TO, EVER AGAIN. I'LL MEET YOU IN THE LOBBY. I'LL BE WAITING. WE'RE STILL A LADY SHORT. YOU'VE GOT TO GO. I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU. I'LL MAKE IT. I PROMISE. HAVE I EVER BROKEN A PROMISE TO YOU? GOOD LUCK, HONEY. PLEASE. ALL SET, EVERYONE? ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. HEY, OUT OF SIGHT. YEAH, IT'S COMING. ALL RIGHT. LET'S UNTIE THIS!

WATCH YOUR HEADS! TAKE IT BACK AND SECURE IT! O.K. ALL RIGHT. LET IT GO. LET IT GO. GO ON! TAKE IT OUT! O.K. TAKE UP ON IT. HOW ABOUT THE MAIN LINE... SECURED? GOOD! AAH! CHIEF! EXPLOSION ABOVE 110. BLEW THE SCENIC ELEVATOR RIGHT OFF ITS TRACK. IT'S HANGING BY A CABLE. HOW MANY PEOPLE IN IT? LOADED. I'D SAY ABOUT 12. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? FLAKER. FLAKER! SIR. CAN YOU GET ME A CHOPPER WITH A WINCH AND SOME CABLE? HAVE THEM PICK ME UP ATOP THE PEERLESS BUILDING. WE'LL TRY AND GET A HITCH ON THAT ELEVATOR, DROP IT DOWN TO THE DECK BY CHOPPER. MOMMY, MOMMY! I WON'T CRY IF YOU WON'T CRY. O.K.! O.K. LET HER GO! LOOK OUT BELOW! ALL RIGHT. LET'S PULL IT IN HERE! PULL IT IN! LET'S HAUL THAT CHAIR IN! COME ON. HAUL IT! THAT'S IT! ALL RIGHT. KEEP HER GOING!

THEN YOU'RE GOING TO PICK UP THE SCENIC ELEVATOR AND VERY GENTLY SET IT DOWN ON THE STREET. CAN YOU HANDLE THE WEIGHT? I THINK WE CAN. WE'LL FIND OUT QUICK. O.K. HOOK IT. O.K. TAKE IT AWAY. HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE? BOB, I WISH I KNEW. GODDAMN IT, JIM, YOU BUILT THE PLACE. I JUST DON'T THINK THAT ALL OF US ARE GOING TO MAKE IT. WELL, I GUESS I'M NEXT. I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'LL LET ME STAY. COME ON. I'LL SEE YOU SOON. I LOVE YOU. LET IT GO! WILL THIS HOLD IT? IT HAD BETTER. WE'LL HAVE TO CUT THE ELEVATOR CABLE. WHAT'S YOUR NUMBER? 68. 47. AAH! AAH! AAH. AAH! AAH! THAT WAS CLOSE. HERE. MRS. RAMSAY. YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT. OH, PLEASE. PLEASE, TELL MY HUSBAND I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. TELL HIM I'M ALL RIGHT. I'LL BE SEEING HIM AT HOME LATER. I WILL. I PROMISE. LET'S GO. OH, THERE SHE IS! SHE'S ALL RIGHT. SHE'S FINE. WATCH THE LADDER. HEY, MIKE! THE DEPUTY WANTS TO SEE YOU. WE'VE BEEN CHECKING THE SITUATION UP IN THE PROMENADE ROOM. WE FIGURE THEY HAVE 17, MAYBE 18 MINUTES LEFT. IT'LL TAKE MORE THAN THREE HOURS TO GET THEM DOWN BY BREECHES BUOY. THEY'LL DIE IF SOMETHING'S NOT DONE. WE MIGHT HAVE THE ANSWER. MR. JOHNSON'S A STRUCTURAL ENGINEER. TELL THE CHIEF YOUR CALCULATIONS. THE STRUCTURAL STRENGTH OF THE PROMENADE'S RISERS, I BELIEVE, COULD DEFINITELY WITHSTAND THE EXPLOSION. WHAT EXPLOSION? CHIEF, WE'VE GOT THE COPTER READY ON THE PLAZA. WE'LL HANDLE THAT. DO YOUR JOB. YES, SIR. WHAT EXPLOSION? WE CAN BLOW THE TANKS TWO FLOORS ABOVE THE PROMENADE ROOM. THEY HOLD MORE THAN ENOUGH WATER TO DROWN THE FIRE. YOU'RE CRAZY. IT'S THE ONLY WAY. HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'LL WORK? YOU COULD KILL EVERYBODY THERE. I DON'T THINK SO. YOU DON'T THINK? WHEN YOU TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE STRESS AND LOAD FACTORS... WAIT A MINUTE. HOLD IT. MIKE, WE'VE ALREADY MADE THE DECISION. SOMEONE HAS GOT TO GO UP THERE, RIG THE CHARGES, AND BLOW THEM. ONLY YOU AND CONNORS ARE QUALIFIED TO DO THAT. CONNORS IS ON HIS WAY TO THE BURN CENTER. LOOK, UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE CAN'T ORDER YOU TO GO UP THERE. I'M JUST LAYING IT OUT FOR YOU. BUT YOU... YOU SEE HOW IT IS, DON'T YOU? HOW DO I GET BACK DOWN? OH, SHIT. THE WOMEN ARE GONE. WE ARE GOING NEXT. YOU'VE ALL GOT NUMBERS, AND YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR TURN. AND IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION...

THEY WANT TO BLOW THOSE WATER TANKS TWO FLOORS ABOVE YOU. IT MIGHT KILL THE FIRE. HOW WILL THEY GET THE EXPLOSIVES UP HERE? THEY'LL FIND SOME DUMB SON OF A BITCH TO BRING IT UP. HANG ON. I'LL TELL THEM. THEY WANT TO TRY TO PUT OUT THE FIRE BY BLOWING UP THE WATER TANKS ABOVE US. IT'LL MEAN A LOT OF WATER AND STEEL. IF THEY DON'T TRY, WE'LL BURN. THE FIRE'S OUT OF CONTROL. THEY FIGURE WE GOT 15 MINUTES. SOME OF US MIGHT SURVIVE. WE GOT NO OPTIONS. COME ON. LET'S GO. GET THAT LINE! GET OFF! SNEAKY BASTARDS. DROP THIS LINE! LET GO OF ME. OH! IT WON'T HOLD EVERYBODY! GET OFF! GET OFF! GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE. NO! NO! GET OFF! AAAH! AAAH! CHIEF! YEAH. WE JUST LOST THE BREECHES BUOY. THERE WAS PANIC UP HERE. IT'S UNDER CONTROL NOW. I'M GOING TO TRY SETTING DOWN ON THE ROOF. I'LL NEED YOU UP THERE. I KNOW WHERE TO PLACE THE CHARGES, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW. I KNOW HOW. O.K. SEE YOU UP THERE. ALL RIGHT! YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TIE YOURSELVES DOWN. ROPES, TABLECLOTHS, BELTS, ANYTHING AVAILABLE. FOR GOD'S SAKE, CARLOS, DON'T TIE YOURSELF UP TO A LOT OF GLASS. THAT'S THE '29. TRY IT. IT'S O.K. DOUG, I... I NEVER THOUGHT A THING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN. SURE. HEY! HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU THINK WE GOT? 10 MINUTES. MAYBE LESS. WE'LL HAVE TO BLOW THE FLOORS AS WELL AS THE TANKS. ALL RIGHT. THIS IS YOUR DETONATOR. YOU'RE RUNNING INSTANTANEOUS, I'M RUNNING DELAYED. HERE YOU GO. THIS IS YOUR EXPLOSIVE. THIS IS THE TIMER. AFTER YOU THROW THE WIRE, WE'LL PLUG IT INTO THE TIMER, SET IT, THEN IT BLOWS. YOU SET YOUR EXPLOSIVE... LIKE THIS. TAKE YOUR DETONATOR... PULL THE PLUG... TOSS IT. GOT IT? I GOT IT. GOOD LUCK. SEE YOU LATER. O.K. THANKS. HERE YOU GO. HOW MUCH YOU GOING TO SET IT FOR? 5? I THINK WE CAN MAKE THAT. THAT'S IT. TIE YOURSELF DOWN, GODDAMN IT! YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT THROUGH THERE. HOW MUCH TIME? 3 1/2. AIR. HERE. I'M BURNING UP! LET'S GO! FIREMAN. AAH! BOB! BOB! OH, GOD! AH. OHH. A-A-AAH. EXCUSE ME. SHE WAS IN THE ELEVATOR WITH YOU, THE FINE-LOOKING LADY... MRS. MUELLER. HAVE YOU SEEN HER? I'M SORRY. SHE'S DEAD. LISE. LISE! LISE! CLAIBORNE. WHAT? I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO SEE HIM. YOU KNOW THERE'S NOTHING THAT ANY OF US CAN DO TO BRING BACK THE DEAD. ALL I CAN DO NOW IS PRAY TO GOD THAT HE CAN STOP THIS FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN. I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE THEY JUST OUGHT TO LEAVE IT THE WAY IT IS, A KIND OF SHRINE TO ALL THE BULLSHIT IN THE WORLD. YOU KNOW, WE WERE LUCKY TONIGHT. THE BODY COUNT'S LESS THAN 200. ONE OF THESE DAYS THEY'RE GOING TO KILL 10,000 IN ONE OF THESE FIRETRAPS, AND I'LL KEEP EATING SMOKE AND BRINGING OUT BODIES UNTIL SOMEBODY ASKS US... HOW TO BUILD THEM. O.K. I'M ASKING. YOU KNOW WHERE TO REACH ME. SO LONG, ARCHITECT. CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX HOME ENTERTAINMENT CAPTIONING PERFORMED BY THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING INSTITUTE, INC.
