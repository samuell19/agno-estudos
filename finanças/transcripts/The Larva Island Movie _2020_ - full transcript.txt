May I take your order, ma'am? What would you recommend that I'd really like? This. And this one, right here. And a salad, I think. Of course. Hello. Welcome. Have you a reservation, sir? Um, Gra... Grace, under... Right on time. He's not here yet? I have a reservation under Grace. Um. Really nice to meet you. And it's nice to meet you. Declared missing from a shipwrecked ocean liner, only to return alive after five-and-a-half years on a desert island. Ever since I first read your story, I've been dying to turn it into a book. Thanks for being here. You're way more handsome in real life than in your pictures. You haven't had lunch yet, right? Um, not yet. That's good. I ordered ahead for us. Thank you. Let's just cover the basics while we're waiting for our lunch to come. Is it all right if I record? Yeah, it's okay. Right. How have you been since your return? Busy, I guess. Adjusting to city life again has been a little rough. Has it, now? Are there strange habits that you can't break from your life in the wild, like capturing and eating pets, or running around town with only a spear and a loincloth? No. Not like that at all. It's just it hasn't been easy being around this many people. Yes, of course. Well, I really appreciate you doing this interview. I had heard you were turning down everybody that asked for one. Well, I've been rather torn about that. I've been worried that no one would believe what I've been through, not all of it. But there are some remarkable little creatures that the world should hear about. "Remarkable creatures"? But weren't you stranded on the island all alone? I was alone, and yet I wasn't. I discovered some special friends. What kind of special friends? Sounds pretty mysterious. After the ship went down... I floated in a ducky tube until I spotted an island. A desert island so small, it took five steps to walk from one end of it to the other. And after six long months alone on the island, something happened. Dude, it's rescue time! So hungry. Ha-ha! Wow, is that fish? Ew! Woo-hoo! Ooh! Stop right there! No! Stop! No, no, no! Stop! The bugs couldn't be real, though. Pretty hard to believe. I get that. Truth is, I didn't believe it at first, either. Being stranded on an island with weird little bugs like them. Could you describe again how the bugs looked? Plus, did you name them? Names? Yes, of course. The red one who's always ticked off is Red. And the stretched-out long one's name is Yellow. - Yellow. - And together, I called them... - I called them Larva. - Larva. Yes! There were two bugs, and he called them... Hang on there. There weren't just two. There was a third. A third bug? Yeah. A primitive one living in the jungle. Like a cave bug or bug Tarzan. Ooh! Wow! Ooh! A-ha! Ooh! Whoo-hoo! A-ha! After that, they were always together. - They were always... - Red had the biggest crush on her. Turns out bugs are just like little slimy people. Um... I see that you don't believe me either. Hey, I really don't not believe you. Unexplainable stuff happens all the time in this world. Just the fact that you were stranded and came back is an incredible story. Yeah, well, guess that's true. Um, then it was you and these three bugs stuck on the island together the whole time? Well, no. It wasn't just me and the bugs. Ooh! I miss you, Clara. Woo! -Woo-hoo! -Hee-hee! Clara. Clara! Clara? Clara? Clara? Clara? You are not Clara! "Clara"? Clara? Clara! Yes. Clara, now flip. Good. Good, girl. Now, dance. That's right. All right. Come on, Clara. Clara? Clara? Clara? Clara. Clara. That's good, Clara. Come, Clara! Right. That's it. Clara! Clara! Clara! Clara! Clara! Let go of that flipper! Clara, where are you going? Clara. Clara! This is completely your fault! You're humming? Clara! Stop it, you stinking bugs! Clara. Clara! Clara! Are you serious? A singing seal? Yes. Whenever I heard Clara's song, I felt happy and warm. This is some tale. Bugs that act like little people and a singing seal? What comes next? Does an alien visit the island in a UFO? Speaking of... What? There was one there. An actual alien. Choice. All right! A little one. Maybe I could just... Are you kidding? Ooh! Scary. Ooh! I was a massive band geek. Wha... What are you, now? Ha! Scary. Hey, are you a... Crabsformer? Come here. It's done! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah! Rescue, rescue, rescue. That's hot! Hot, hot, hot! Hot! My boat! We didn't hit it off at first. But I guess I owe him, because he helped me build the boat that got me home. Yeah. The Crabsformer. Your lunch is served. Mangia! This is... It's crab. I didn't think... Don't you want some? Why not? It's really yummy. I'm crazy for crab. Great! I'm very happy to hear that. Hey, wait! What kinds of things did you eat on the island to survive? It was hard. I was hungry all the time. Let me tell you something about fish. They don't care if you caught them fair and square! Right. And here's your coffee. Thanks for that. Although, Larva helped expand my dinner menu. What's that smell? The savory aroma of seaweed enfolded my entire body. It was like waltzing with the waves. And that ribbon of sweetness on top, is making all my senses do somersaults in sheer delight! My! That's great! Whoo! It's... It's the island on a plate! We're about to eat our entire island! Yes! So refreshed! Wow! I am one with this fish. Yes! Smack me with your life force! But there's deeper flavor. True treasure! Felt only in a humpback whale's bellybutton. Yes! The fabled rainbow clam! The entire island plate. Dare I say, the entire earth is in my mouth, massaging my taste buds! Porridge? For real? Ooh, what's this? This tastes familiar already. This yearning... I can't stop. This... ...tastes just like my mom's porridge. It's all right, my dear boy. Mom! Mom, can I please have one more bowl? Is that your... What, the bug's throw-up? Sounds gross, but it was so good. Mister, your story's the funniest thing ever! Tell us some more! Wendy. You know you're not supposed to bother the customers. Sorry, I apologize. My daughter is very curious. No, I'm fine with her hearing. You? All right, yeah! She's very welcome. Yay! Okay, but be quiet. Right, I'll be quiet, Dad. Well, shall we get back to it? Can you tell us about Larva in greater detail? Well... One minute, they're at each other's throats, then, turn around, and they're risking their lives for each other. Fishy, you're mine! How long has it been since I've had fish? Whoa! Ooh, no! I've had enough of you brats! Go away! Take that! You guys ruin everything! What is this? What the... Get off my sacred food! You beauty! You're gonna taste amazing! Now, make a little fire. Yes! Burn, baby! Burn! Burn! Yes! No! So close! And yet so far! But hey! What's this? Lucky me! Here we go! Here we go! Lovely aroma. What? Why you... Go away! Stop it, all right? I mean it! Just let me grill my yummy fishy. That's how you want it? Hot! Now, it's your turn! Burn! All right, fish, where were we? Seriously? Dinner is finally served. Why are you doing this? Why? Why? Well, we'll see who wins. Only one match left. Stubborn little booger. All right. Draw. Ooh, look! What's that? That's so disgusting! Where's my match? Please don't let it go out! Curse that farting bug! Come on! Hold on, flame, here I come! Gas boom! It worked! It's burning! I win! I win! Beautiful fire! Happy fish party! No. Come back! Come back! The life of a pollack fish. After the narrow escape, the pollack's relief is short-lived for there are countless dangers that lurk in the ocean. However, in the fierce struggle for survival with its natural enemies, the pollack has become stronger and smarter. Our pollack turns out to be a female. With spawning season upon her, many males begin their overtures. The flashy movements of one male are eye-catching. The female pollack is interested. So begins their pollack romance. First comes love. And then, of course, comes... a hundred thousand to a million little fishy miracles. And when the time comes, they will leave their parents' embrace to start a new journey in the vast world. Like their parents, they must survive many hardships and seek out a partner, so that they may fill the world with little miracles of their very own. The life of a pollack fish. Fin. The end. - Wow! Awesome! - For real? Those bugs are like a phoenix or something. Yes, they are. Those little boogers could survive any danger ever! Chuck. Lots of people seem interested in this story of yours. It's the first time that's happened. Mister! Please! Please keep telling us your story! This is the best story I've heard in my 84 years on Earth. So true! I'm dying to try some of that tasty bug cuisine. Your lunch is on me, if you agree to tell us some more. Chuck? Chuck! Are you all right with them hearing the rest of the interview? You bet. I'm really touched you all wanna hear what I went through. Yay! Um... Great! Good! If I'm honest here, this is hard to swallow. It sounds like a fantasy movie. And you haven't heard the half of it. I haven't even gotten to the crazy stuff. Why is it so cloudy today? Who cares? I've still got the best boat. And today, wait for it! We add the umbrella sail! Wha... Why is this... Did I ever tell you until college, I was on the soccer team! Ha! Rotten bugs! Ha, breeze feels nice. No!! It's all because of you, bugs! It's all because of you, bugs! This ends right now, you hear? No, you don't! You're done living up to your name. My head. What happened again? Right, lightning. Those annoying bugs. Little monsters. I can't wait to turn them into puddles of goo on the beach. What the... Who's that? This is not happening! This can't be! A bug! A bug is me! What have you done to me, you horrible nightmare? Food! Finally! So big! Stay back! Nice chicken. You now? Come on! Sorry, I pushed you so darn hard. Please don't hurt me! Ooh! Somebody help! I'm trapped in a madhouse! Yum! I'm a gross and revolting ugly bug. Chicken tried to eat me whole. That even worse... I just thought of them as dumb little awful bugs. What? Sounds like... My! I'm here! Please help! What the... Bug, right. Just like the last storm. Really? All right! Look. Yum, yum, yum! You know you want it! No, not yet! All right! Here it comes! Not now! Let go of me! Please! That boat was my ticket back home! Of course, it was only a dream. Is that a ship? Yo, over here! There's someone here! Why, you little rotten bugs! Think that's funny, do you? I'm sorry for acting so mean. That hurts! Why, you rotten little bugs! After that stuff, I was able to understand them better. It was a force of habit. -I'm sorry! -All right. There, there. So you're telling us you shared a bond with your bug buddies? Yeah. But not just my bug buddies. With Clara, Booby, Crabsformer. Mudskippers as well. We were trying to survive together, after all. I'm sorry, little fly! The thunder's so loud! Wendy, it's all right. Daddy's here, darling. Is it gonna storm? Looks like we're in for some temperamental weather. Weather. The weather on the island was absolutely cuckoo. Either burning hot or freezing cold. Freak tornadoes would rip up out of nowhere. Why have icebergs completely surrounded the island? Save me! I'm not gonna be an icicle. We have to burn everything we can. No! The fire's going out! There's nothing else to burn. What do we do? Lighter. My lighter! There you are. Ha-ha! We're saved, Clara! We're saved! We thawed up! Yahoo! What is that stink? Hungry. You little devils! What the... Wha... A fish? Ooh! I love you! What's happening? Cla... Clara? Clara, why are you flying? What the... Typhoon! Save me, please! Cave door's blocked! Ooh! Quick! Quick! Come on! Please. Ooh! My butt! The rock is coming loose. Can't keep holding on! You guys... Has it passed? I guess it hasn't passed! Clara! No! Awesome. A whale? Watch out! Is that the... eye of the storm? Are you kidding? The storm's eye is an actual eye? Well, let's give it a poke. This is pretty messed up right here. We've got to put that big eye out! Come on, you guys! Ready? Fly! Storms have real eyes? It's just so... freaky. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it myself. But I promise it's true. -But that's bizarre. -True that. Awesome sauce! Any of them wear glasses, you think? Darnedest thing I ever heard. Um, so, then, tell us how you got off the island. Yeah! -Yeah. -Tell us how you escaped! Yes, do that! Did a boat come along? Did you swim across the ocean? Get home. That's what I was thinking the whole time I was there. But I failed to escape so many times. I don't even know how many rafts I made. But, one day... ...something happened that meant we had to leave the island. This is so nice. What the... A volcano? Everyone, get on the raft! We need to leave now. Everybody here? What about the others? What are they doing? You know, until 11th grade... ...I was on the baseball team! We've got to escape. No! How can we ever get across that? Lava everywhere! Right. Come on. It's live or die time. I... I can do this. Hyah! Ooh! Until the 12th grade... ...I was on the... ...the Pole Dancing team! Whoo! It's over now. I guess this is how I'm going to die. You guys take care. Enjoy my last performance. I'm gonna die for acting nice. I'm such a dumb, dumb, stupid... What's that? Co... coconut?! Thank you, friends! All right! Hot! Made it! Ooh! This is the end of it all. To ending this after all the suffering. I thought if I just got off the island, then I'd be fine. God, are you gonna end me this way? Rain! Thank you! Are you kidding? Whoa! Come on, paddle! Thank you, dear friends. Everyone, just hang on! We'll be all right! Save me! We're safe! Look! What the... It stings! Where did all the flying fish come from? Thank you for this meal! So good! Come on! It's party time! That was good. You know, thank goodness you guys are here. Owie! Could it be? Could it really be real? Am I back? I'm really back! Then I said farewell to everyone and I was alone. But still, you at least were able to return home safely. Yeah. But I lost the family I found there. I wonder if they're all all right. Mister, don't worry at all. I'm sure your little bug friends are safe and happy somewhere. Just like you are. They've gotta be. You said yourself they never die. - They're strong. - We're right, you know. Yes, you are. They're remarkably strong. And they keep on smiling, no matter what. Yay, bugs! Go on. Please tell us other adventures you had with Larva. Ooh! Larva! Larva! Larva! Best story ever! Yeah, all right. I'll tell you about the time me and Larva went shark fishing. Yay! We got stuck right in a big humpback whale's blowhole. The smell. It cleared up. It's been great. Come back anytime. - Thank you! - Bye, silly man. - Bye, Wendy! - Silly. Well, that was certainly something else. I guess it was. I don't remember having a nicer talk. Thanks very much for talking to me today. Sure, not a problem. I thank you. I realized today it's not as important everyone believe me as I thought it was. As long as I still remember my friends, I'll remember it's all true. Whether people believe it all really happened, well, that's up to them. I finally truly feel like I've completely left the island behind. Well, we're happy to have you back, Chuck. Thanks very much, Grace. I won't forget your help. Ever. To be honest, when I first heard his story, I thought he was a big, lying liar pants. Even now, I'm still not sure I believe all of it. But I've written this book with the earnest hope that everyone will hear of his amazing experiences, and the special friends he made on the island. And I hope people enjoy my writing too. Could it all be hooey in bunk? Everyone who heard Chuck's brave, intense story, myself included... ...felt almost transported to the island themselves. It was clearly real to Chuck. And frankly... ...that's good enough for this writer. I hope it's real to all who read this book as well. Clara. No, no. I just left. Yes. Hang on. Yeah! I'm still here. Sure. I'll be right there. I love you too. Subtitle translation by Uei-sung Kim
