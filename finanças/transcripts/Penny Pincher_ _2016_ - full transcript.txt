What did you expect me to say? That her dad's the world's biggest tight-wad? The stingiest, miserliest guy I ever met? No, sorry, I chose to give her a positive image for her to build on. Every night, she wanted to hear about your orphanage in Mexico. Her eyes lit up when I told her about you. Have you got kids? They're not mine. Calm down! Mr. Gautier's calling his wife! She's not my wife! - Can't they be quiet? - This way. In you go. The quiet spot in the house. I'm here. Why'd she come to find me now? I always told her you'd disappeared in the Amazon. Without trace. Great idea, the Amazon. Why change it? I cracked. I sensed she really needed her father. I told her you'd been found and come home. She landed a vacation job 20 minutes from you. Geriatrics in a hospital. Helping people. Like her dad. Too good to miss. No, it wasn't too good to miss. Carole, you have to take her back. - That's complicated. - Why complicated?

What for? I know. She's engaged and wants a dowry. A dowry? They're history. What, then? Maybe to get to know you better. You're very naive for a banker. Here. Jot down her phone number. What for? If I don't call every 48 hours, she's kidnapped me. The police can track down her number, even overseas. - Are you sure? - Jot it down! Excessive, isn't it? So she pops out of nowhere with no ulterior motive? She wants my money. As I understand it, right now, she's giving you money. It's a trick. To get more out of me. Hey! The old folks killed me. What are we doing tonight? Will you play violin? Just for me? Not tonight, I'm going out. Where? - To a restaurant. - Who with? Someone. The cellist? Come on, I saw you both at the concert. I think she likes you. Not at bit. She does. What are you wearing? I'm fine the way I am. Makeover time. I'm just fine. Please, makeover! Please! It'll be fun. No, you were right. Go as you are. What did I tell you? - Do you like champagne? - Yes. I have a little foible. When I go out to dinner, it's champagne or nothing. Champagne, then. I like it too. So that's lucky. Home from home. A taste of Brittany! The full works, egg sunny side up, and for dessert... Kouign Amman! Shoot, you're on a diet. No, actually, I have food allergies. Basically, wheat, corn, gluten, pasta, cheese, eggs, rice and every kind of flour. I get gastric holes and then... No, I'm not into flour either. It's no problem. You can make crepes without flour? I'm so embarrassed. I should have told you. It looks really very good. On the way here, I saw a seafood restaurant. Seafood? You're sure it was open? Looks good. Very. Evening, ma'am, sir... An aperitif to begin, perhaps? No, it's too much with the champagne. Sir prefers a particular champagne? If not, I recommend the excellent Cuvée Spéciale from Bollinger, right here. You've got it! That's a rare find. Valérie, you have to taste this. Excellent. Cider. A glass for the lady. Nothing for me. A jug of water. Parched. Excellent. A jug of water. You've chosen your appetizers? Not at all. I could eat everything! I love crab! Velvet crab, clams, oysters... Gilardeau, my favourites! Watch out, it's not the season until the month ends in... - That's true. - Absolutely. - In that case... - No. You're quite right. Abalone! I love it! Another rare find. Excellent choice. Served on a bed of truffles. The surf-turf combination is astonishing. If I may, I recommend the speciality of the house, flambéed blue lobster. Divine! If it's divine... I'll take it. And for sir? I'm not very hungry. You've got whelks? Yes, sir. A plate of whelks. That could be too much, a whole plate. Can I order per whelk? No, sir. How strange. Main course, sir? Nothing. No, I... Sorry, I... I'll nibble some bread. With the whelks' mayonnaise. Excellent. Excuse me. Thank you, ma'am. A bit odd, isn't he? You're right, let's go. We just ordered. And I'm pretty hungry now. Short fuse you've got there. It's divine but... I'm full. Pity. No worries. Finish it at home. You've never seen a doggy bag? The English always do it. The dessert menu for madam? No, thank you. I'm full. And sir? Also full? The check? - Yeah. - Excellent. I wanted to ask you something. I do a lot of work with a non-profit that helps research into orphan diseases... We regularly organize events, galas or concerts... Are you listening? - You're listening? - Yes. - No. - I am. What did I say? That I wasn't listening. Your check, sir. The jug of water is on the house. Will you stop smirking like that? Madam can tell you, I have a very short fuse. A short fuse? Isn't short too much for you? Wouldn't want to waste that fuse. You're nuts! Shut the fuck up, you ravenous bitch! You'd eat everything? So eat! - Are you okay? - Not great. - I'm really hot. - You're sweating. I'll go freshen up in the bathroom. Ladies and gentlemen, we are so sorry. A flaw in our fire system. We've no idea how it happened. Truly, we apologize. I hope you'll come back soon. Sorry. What matters is no one was hurt. Very true. Better take a taxi. Walking will dry us off. There's one! That was fun. You're going home? It's only 9:30. Already? Hop in. - I'm going the other way. - You don't know where I live. I live the other way from everywhere. Get in, you'll catch cold. Goodnight! I choked. I knew it'd be a disaster. I can't... Calm down. Can't do what? Anything! I screwed up, as usual, even though I really like her. That's okay. Invite her out again. She's allergic to anything cheap. Pasta, rice, crepes! It's hopeless, honestly. I feel terrible. I'll stop by to see you. Actually, I'm eating with my family. Him again? I'll catch up, I only had bread to eat. Let's meet tomorrow at the bank. I promise I won't stay late. That's what you said last time and you stayed-- That's a no. Goodnight, Mr. Gautier. The banker who can't say no! GAUTIER BASTARD Sir! You here? We don't have a lesson. I came to pay for them. About time too! My parents gave me this, too. - What is it? - To say sorry for paying late. Thank them. After 30 years away from Brittany, at last I'm going home. HAPPY RETIREMENT! While I potter, I'll think of you, picturing you here, getting your eardrums destroyed by the arpeggios of our darling students. Hold off, dammit! Hello. I'm starving too. Hide me. Thank you so much. And now, everybody, tuck in! Thanks, François. Don't mention it. François didn't chip in. He ducked out! As usual. How long do we go back? I don't know, 10 years? You even skimp on that. 20 years. Not enough, obviously, for a gift. It's plenty. I just wanted to give you something more personal. For me? Who else is retiring today? I'm deeply touched. Sorry about... No problem. You're crazy! You remembered he's my favourite violinist? 20 years we go back. And you wrote an inscription. Really? "To Mr. Gautier, with thanks "for your patience with Gaëtan. "Gwenaëlle and Loïc at the creperie." Do I keep it? Or give it back? Okay, tuck in, everybody! Check it out! I bought a tablecloth. Like it? I took down your post-its but didn't throw them away. Better, right? Look... He won't be so bored now. Listen... You need to go back to your mom's. How come? You're not happy I'm here? You didn't forget, at least? Forget what? The residents' meeting. To ensure the pleasure of your presence, we're holding it here. That's too bad, I have a date. Shoot! Come on. Hold on. No, not the light, we can see just fine. Switch it off! Switch it off! - Miss. - Evening. So, on today's agenda... The upgrade of the sewage system, redevelopment of the cul-de-sac and above all garbage collection point with improved accessibility, in order to avoid residents making a trip there and back that is long and annoying from their house to the street corner. This expenditure, remember, has been blocked for 5 years by the refusal to pay... of Mr. Gautier, who is in attendance and our host tonight. Good! Before we proceed to vote, a word on the accounts. All residents are up to date with payments except... Mr. Gautier, whose arrears amount to 3,143 Euros in respect of the aforementioned garbage collection point. Let me see if I find my chequebook. Of course. Look hard, Mr. Gautier. We have plenty of time. We're not going anywhere. Yes, Mr. Gautier? I need to declare bankruptcy! Can't be easy for you. What? Having a father like him. How come? - He is so... - So... - What? - Stingy. A tight-wad. My father? A tight-wad? I give them a check and cancel it after I file a complaint for kidnapping. Yeah, that sounds good. But it won't fly. Won't fly? Suggest something. You're the banker! Sure, why? Why? You must have a way to stash my money. He's the most generous person I know. Told you, she's not his daughter. He is my father! Have you seen his lifestyle? Why d'you think he lives in deprivation? Penny pinching? Sure. That's so unfair! Honestly, that makes me want to smash things up. - Calm down, miss. - Calm down? Just think, you're talking about garbage, when because of you people will die in Mexico. Who'll die in Mexico? His orphans. His orphans of what? Look, Mr. Gautier, I know this is not what you want to hear, but sometimes in life, there is no other solution than to... pay. Blockhead! How could we guess if you don't say? Unbelievable! Why not tell us? Modesty is fine for a while, Mr. Gautier, but when you constantly go without to save every Euro for the benefit of orphans in Mexico, you should be proud! It's quite a shock, even so. To think we, your neighbours, had no idea. Why didn't you ever mention it? It didn't occur to me. Thank you. Bravo, Mr. Gautier! With regard to your arrears, as we said, take your time. You'll pay whenever you can. - We're not monsters. - Thank you. You're not mad at me? You never publicize it, but they said horrible things. It just came out. Yeah, well, never mind. You should've seen them listening wide-eyed... Like I was 7 again, recounting your adventures at school. I was so proud! Good clothes and gifts at Christmas. For him, it was the best day of his life. And he is my daddy! Can I stay a bit longer? Please. Okay. Cool. I'll put this away. They're all offering to help. The old guy, who's at least 100, wants to lend you his car to go to work. And the lady at no.8 has started knitting gloves and socks for your Mexicans. Woollen ones. I said, with the weather, wool gloves in Mexico, maybe not. Just think, you have opened their eyes on global poverty. You're amazing! I'd better go. You took notes? Unplug the extension cords before bed. Check-- No appliances are on standby. Don't worry, I won't forget. I have my list and... all your post-its. - That's me. - See you tomorrow. Are you okay? Walter has appendicitis. He can't conduct. Really? It's my big chance. I'll never get another. - I'm so nervous. - Don't worry, you'll be fine. It was my dream as a kid to be a conductor. It's a full house. This will be wonderful. We start in five minutes. I totally forgot, be careful when you flush... When you flush, I said! When you flush! I was saying... Be very careful when you flush. When I'm flush? Auguste, stop playing with the lights. Who's that? You're not alone? No, the neighbour's here with his kids. The neighbour? What for? Don't worry, it's under control. What's under control? Dad! There's no hot water left! What do you mean? Already? What did he say? Neighbour, your water tank's tiny. And it's pitch dark. Not a single lamp works. Why's he in my house? - Some kind of issue. - What kind of issue? Repossession and revolver loans or something. But I found envelopes with cash inside. Not my envelopes! It'll cover dinner tonight, but you need to shop tomorrow. Your credit has expired. Laura! What on earth are you doing? Everybody's looking for you, to begin. - I can't, father. - What? Cancel! What the hell! I have to get home right now. After you reimburse total ticket sales. Thank you. The Four Seasons in under 12 minutes. You just ruined my career. I'll never get another chance. - I hate you. - Jean-Pierre... It was him! Such daring! Such rhythm! So modern! It was fabulous. You'll go far, sir. We have witnessed the birth of a great conductor. You're all invited to dinner at the presbytery to celebrate! No dinner, I have to get home. François, it's on the house. My daughter has a problem, home alone. She left a light on? Stop, it's not funny. He's totally frantic. Please, can someone give me a lift? Yes, I can. Do you mind accelerating? I don't like going too fast. I'm in a hurry. What the hell is going on? Just after you left, repo men arrived and took everything, couch, TV! Cut off water, electricity. So what are they doing here? My saviour! You nailed revolving loans. I knew you'd help. The guy at the garbage shed told me your whole story. When the repo men came, I told the kids, Have no fear! Neighbour will save us! I invited them in, like you'd have done. Without you, we were homeless. Like your Mexicans! Luckily, tu casa es mi casa! Right, neighbour? Hey, kids, sing your song for Mr. Gautier. The song! Mr. Gautier! Mr. Gautier! He came to save us one day Mr. Gautier! He's like Santa Claus on his sleigh! Evening. Valérie. Laura, my daughter. - Where's this cable go? - The cable? It was tricky, but I hooked up to your panel. That's a huge help. The kids can't sleep without lights on. I even lit up the decorations. Check it out! Okay, kids, the song again. Neighbour? - Call Social Services! - It's okay, François. Calm down. - Everything's fine. - What's going on? You had a kind of anxiety attack. You slept 14 hours. I did? Do you feel better? I'm fine. Yes, I remember. The neighbour and his kids. A nightmare! It's over now. They're fine. Thanks to you. Your daughter's right, you invest too much emotionally. Right, my daughter. Where is she? She had to go to work. She asked me if I could stay seeing as I came home with you. I was here anyway, so I said sure. What's all that? Supplies. For your Mexicans. From all the neighbours. I know everything. Your daughter told me all about Mexico, the orphans. Yeah, that. Why didn't you say? - I don't like talking about it. - It's silly. All the gossip behind your back. I told the whole orchestra about your Mexicans. Even Julie, the double bass. I put her straight. Your struggle! Depriving yourself to save those children. The bitch wouldn't believe me. Makes me sick! I gave her both barrels. It's just jealousy! Uptight bitch needs to get laid. It's obvious. Dammit, she should get her double bass and jam it... Sorry. Now I'm getting too emotional. I have a favour to ask. The non-profit I told you about. Orphan diseases. Like your Mexicans. Well, the gala's this weekend and... I'm giving a concert and I thought, why not play a duet, just the two of us? Obviously, the two of us, if it's a duet. All expenses paid, all inclusive, as they say. Beautiful rooms and a spa even. Your daughter can come. I'm not... I'm not saying we could... She told me she'd never heard you play. She'll be so impressed. Easy on the accelerator pedal. You'll see... That's what I call a car! Nice of him to lend it out. It's nice of him to lend it out. By the way, you know they're still collecting for your Mexicans? It's great. Thanks to you, they've changed. - Changed? - They're learning to give. The good thing about giving is you receive in return. I'm right, like I was about Valérie. What about Valérie? You like her, don't you? Yes, I like her a lot, but it's complicated. Sure, it's complicated. I see you with her. You're uptight, distant... With everyone, in fact. You need to open up to people. I don't know how. So learn. It's too late. Too late doesn't exist. I'm so glad you made it. I'll show you to your rooms. It's so beautiful. Dinner's at 8, with the concert afterwards. You look great in the tux. It's borrowed. It's just great. - Valérie won't resist. - Stop that. Can't hear a thing. Speak up! Evening. Thanks for coming tonight. As you know, the Pasteur Hospital plans to open a centre, and that's why they need our help. I mean, your money, mostly. And to encourage you to give, I'm relying on one man's powers of persuasion. He's an extraordinary and admirable man. He's here tonight. François Gautier. Before I ask him to speak, I'd like to invite tonight's guest of honour up here... Mr. Chabal. Clap! Good evening. Firstly, I'd like to thank so many of you for showing your support tonight. I know that you will be very, very generous. I'm sorry. You weren't expecting that. I need you and your commitment to shake them up. Knowing you, if I'd asked you, you'd have said no. Of course. What will I tell them? The truth. Tell them who you really are. That's right! When I was in Mexico, in that little village in... in Mexico, and all those little orphans from Mexico were running around me, shouting El gringo, I looked at the horizon and suddenly I was reminded of the first words of the poem by Fernando Garcia... I can't do it. I'm sorry, I can't do it. Who am I to lecture you in morality, to tell you to hand over money you might want to keep? You're expecting me to tell you all that I've done for others, when in fact tonight, I want to talk to you about another man. The guy who wants to give when he cannot. I say this because he's here tonight. No, don't bother looking at your neighbour. Because that guy... is me. He's you. He's all of us. I also want to tell him... I want us all to tell him, to tell this guy, Don't be scared. You can do it. You can change. You can give. So, I'd like to make a personal donation for this hospital and those sick children. I'd like to give the first check. A check for 30 Euros. 50. More. 60? 1,000! 1,500! 3,000! 3,000! 3,000! 3,000! There! Come on! 3,000 Euros! Your turn now. You can't give less. Let's see your chequebooks. Come on! You're feeling okay? You ran away before I could congratulate you. The emotion... I'm a bit icky but it's okay. Your speech was awesome. I'll go get my violin to prepare for the concert. I think he really can change. Who can? The guy in your speech. I need to hurry. François, I wanted to say... I've never met a man like you before. I'm not the man you imagine. I know. You're better. She has qualities I never suspected. For the first time in my life, I think it could maybe work out. - What? - I'm happy for you. Thank you. No problem. All this is thanks to you. You're right, in fact. Too late doesn't exist. What did I tell you? A missile! I took the liberty of fixing your gate. You don't mind? No, not at all. Could you go up on the roof? Slates need changing and I get dizzy. No, just kidding. Of course. Thanks for your... It's a rocket. - Admit it. - Yeah. A real rocket. Here. I don't use it anymore. Great. I'll let you finish up. - Yes, I'll finish up. - Alright. - Have a good day. - You too. Thanks, bye. I'm late for the hospital. You're working today? Yes. I have rent to pay. MUM How's it going? You're so right. He's a real tight-wad. Sure I'm right. He gives nothing. You have to steal it!!! Steal it!!! The bitches! What's up? I tried calling, but you didn't answer. Sorry, I rushed out and forgot my phone. I understand your disappointment. I told you, he'll never change his ways. I'll get a coffee. Hello. A coffee, please. - Laura Delmaire, please. - Just a second. One second! So? - Back from India? - I can explain. Don't bother, I get it. "He gives nothing, steal!" Go ahead. Try stealing. Don't make me laugh. It's pathetic, trying to get revenge like this. I never wanted a kid. At the time, if you'd asked, I'd have said, abort! Rather than father a thief! Come here. There's your thief. Look! Look! A whole year with one kidney! Now that one's failing. She has to come here 3 times a week. What she needs now is a transplant. She has a very rare blood group. Different from mine. We can't find a donor. Why didn't you tell me? "Hello, François, it's me. Could you give..." You'd have hung up before I got the question out. There's no guarantee you'd be compatible. So you had to put on this big act? It was my idea. So you'd grow attached to her before we asked. Who the hell do you two think I am? What you are, François! I'm so pleased. I spoke with the Foundation. You got us over double our target. A problem? What's wrong? Surprise! Here. A cake. The kids made it. My wife came home. She missed the kids, she said. Women, they're not like us. I wanted to thank you for the banker contact. He got me a loan to cover my revolving loans. So we got our furniture back. Neighbour, I sense this is a bad time. Here. There you go. Give Laura our love. Goodbye, Mr. Gautier. We made zero mistakes. FANKS MISSER GOTIER I'd like... I want us to make peace. Make peace? Can you imagine how it felt when mum said who you really were? When she said that the father I'd pictured as a kid didn't exist. And, in fact, the opposite was true. Let's make peace, if you want. But I'm afraid it's not enough. I don't know why I'm like this. Ever since I was little... I never could fight it. I'm well aware it cuts me off from other people. So I'm alone. And... I'll be more and more alone. But now, you are my daughter. And I'm happy being your father. My father died a long time ago in Mexico. Go now, please. Sorry I didn't mean... Where's your father? Gone. Didn't he tell you? He took the tests 2 days ago. It's all good for the transplant. Dad! Bravo for Mexico. Thanks. I was right to tell them. - Bravo for the orphans. - Yes, I know. You deserve the compliments. It's all thanks to you. Seriously. You're so generous! I have to say something extremely important. I don't know how or if it's the right time. Me too! Just a moment. You bitch... Take your big fat double bass... - She's not staying. - She has plans, I think. All the children were there. Now they could buy good food, good clothes and have gifts at Christmas. Is sorpresa a surprise? Yes! El gringo Gautier! El gringo Gautier! He came to save us one day He's like Santa Claus on his sleigh Goodbyios! We have to dash. The chicken guy is taking us to Guanblabla. From there his brother-in law will drop us at Pata Negra. I'll play violin to pay for the ride and everything. - And then? - We'll see. Many gracias for the... Let's rollios! Magnificent! When I tell Valérie.. Why not call her? Call France right now? With the time difference, she's asleep. It's 8 at night there. Sure, but Valérie's no night owl. Of course. Maybe they didn't understand my Spanish. Looks that way. We're gonna die of thirst. Devoured by a bear. There aren't many bears in Mexico. More than there are cars on this road. Look, what's that? A bear? Don't even look at it. Don't look. I'm not riding in that. I refuse to ride in that! I'm not getting in! I'll pay you to get in! Come on! Subtitles: Simon John Subtitling: HIVENTY
