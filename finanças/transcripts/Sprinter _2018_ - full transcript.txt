You seem to have come out of nowhere. Last year this time you weren't even on the track and field radar. And now you're being hailed as Jamaica's next big sprinting sensation. Isn't that a lot of pressure for a youngster like you? Track and field in Jamaica is very competitive so, it's just what you do with the pressure, my coach said to me, "You have to turn pressure into propulsion." Like rocket propulsion? Rocket propulsion, I like that. And what fuels the Rasta Rocket? My mother and my brother. - Your brother? - Yeah. The legendary Germaine Sharp, who sat in that very chair 10 years ago? Yes. Wow! Well, let's just hope the Rasta Rocket stays in orbit for a little longer. A family legacy to restart and for his mother's love. Quite a race for the Rasta Rocket.

It's now down to the girls' Class Two 100 meters. This is Heat Two. And now a message from the most honorable Prime Minister of Jamaica. Ladies and gentlemen, competitors. Welcome to the boys and girls championships. No pass, no ID, no entry. Rasta Rocket, wha' gwaan? You all right? All right, Class One boys, four-by-one relay team. Hendricks, Williams. - Sharp. Why the hell you dressed like that? - Long story, coach. - Where's your track suit? If you're not dressed and ready to race in 15 minutes, go home. Let's turn our attention to the boys' 200 meter, Heat Three on the cards. Which will showcase the favorite Akeem Sharp of St. Lazarus High coming into the event with the fastest time. He goes into his marks as the rest of the field we have to look our for J-C's Palmer and K-C's Robert. Athletes on their marks. In the set position, and the gun sets them off. The start of the boys' Class One 200 meter Heat Three. Parker coming around the bend from Jamaica College on two. He's on the outside- Hey! Akeem! When did this happen? Sharp? And don't tell me it's today. Last night. Damn waste. Akeem? Akeem. All right, I'm here son, I'm here. I'm always here. I'm always here. It's all right, it's all right. You awake? Your mother just called again. I don't know what to say to her. All right. Dad. Eh? Sorry. Me sorry too. About everything. - What about Germaine? - What about him? We can't just make him stay in jail. Akeem, I'm not sure what else I can do. - Bail him. - With what? Me have money. In there so. Where you get this money from, Akeem? It no matter, just get him out- - It does matter! It's Germaine money. Germaine is my son, and I love him as much as you do. But I don't know where this money come from and I don't want no part of it. Coach say anything about me? Yeah, nothing nice though. You forgive me? Not really. So why you come here? You don't have no friend. Me look like me need a friend? Please. What you need? I made the Youth Games team, and we gonna need the best team we can get. I don't have no reason to go to L-A no more. So you did just run for your mother? What happened to yourself? Look at my foot. What me can do with that? You're not the first athlete to get injured, Akeem. You might, however, be the first one to break a high school record and then just give up. Why you pressure me? Track's hard, you know? I did have my reasons to do it, and I don't have them no more. I miss my parents too, but I'm not running for them. I'm running for myself, to realize my own potential. That's the best me can do for them anyways. You have a mother, a father, and guess what? The two of them just want you to be happy, that's it. So figure out what that is and do it well. It just better be running! How are you? You all right? I just want shake off this vibe. Akeem, careful with the foot. Come. Akeem, Akeem, careful with the foot! - Blessings, blessings. - Greetings King. Blessings, blessings, welcome. Sorry about last time. We live and we learn. Blessings. And thanks for dad. No need for that. Blessings princess. I can give you something for that. He that dwelleth in the secret place of The Most High, shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of my Lord, he's my refuge And my fortress, My God, in Him will I trust. Surely He shall deliver thee From the snare of the fowler, And from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with His feathers And under His wings, will we trust. His truth shall be thy shield and buckler. Thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night, Nor for the arrow that flieth by day, Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness, Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. You all right, man? Let's go home. Did the police pressure you? Of course them pressure me but I never tell them nothing. I know you didn't. How you know? Them wouldn't give me bail if you did.

If you don't make it flow you'll just crash and burn, you understand? All right, take the 200 for instance, it's a tactical race break it down section by section. So the first part of the race, like first 40, first 50, you have to be explosive. Drive from the blocks, push out, and use all the power you have. See the next 50, you have to work hard enough but you have to make it efficient. So you can't swing off the corner, into the straight. Third 50 now, it's all about getting your posture right, and being upright. Swing the arms and just make it flow. Coming to the last 50 now is most important because most people feel like they want to go faster but you can't. It's all about maintaining. Lift your legs. Akeem move, move, move. That's how the race is won. I'm go do some exercise right now so, we'll talk, all right?
