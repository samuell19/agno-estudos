From the moment people are born, it's all been decided… whether you get to look down on others or have to look up to others. There are only those two kinds of people. Hey! Can't you talk? RYO SUZAKI 3RD YEAR STUDENT, SENOMON TECH HIGH Remember what I said? We will destroy you if you don't join us. KOHEI AMAGAI 3RD YEAR STUDENT, SENOMON TECH HIGH AMAHISA SABO (SABOTEN) 3RD YEAR STUDENT, SENOMON TECH HIGH Let's bounce. REIJI HIMURO 3RD YEAR STUDENT, KAMASAKA HIGH KAZUSHI IWATSUGU (GANDHI) 3RD YEAR STUDENT, KAMASAKA HIGH Give it to them! SHOJI SAMEOKA 3RD YEAR STUDENT, EBARA HIGH JIN KAZAMI (FUJIN) 3RD YEAR STUDENT, EBARA HIGH MASATO UENARI (RAIJIN) 3RD YEAR STUDENT, EBARA HIGH FUJIO HANAOKA 3RD YEAR STUDENT, OYA HIGH SUZURAN BOYS HIGH SCHOOL SUZURAN Excuse me! Is Rao around? Who the hell are you? I'm Fujio Hanaoka, a senior at Oya High. Oya High? Do you have any idea where you are? I do! This is Suzuran, right? He's mine. -Is that the best you can do, Binzo? -Let me handle him! He's mine! Bastard! Who the hell are you? Want to fight, Binzo? Who the hell are you? Nice. I like it! Suzuran is the best! You're pretty freaking good, dude. You're pretty badass yourself. Looks like fun! Hey! Let me join in. Stay out of this, Magoroku! Hey! That's enough, Binzo. Back off. Move. I'm Mashii, a senior here. You're from Oya High, right? Oya High? They are the guys who rumbled with the Housen baldies. Right. You came all the way here, so what the hell do you want? He came to meet Rao. Our Rao is so popular, everybody's waiting in line just to shake his hand. You can't just cut in line like this. You need to take a number and wait your turn. What? Take a number… -Where can I get one? -Hey! Not bad… but I think Doroki is better. You're good. That was your number. Fujio Hanaoka, I've got my eye on you. Glad to know. I got my number, huh? Suzuran is hilarious. SUZURAN Hey, jerk! What the heck are you looking at? Rao? What are you mumbling? You're not from around here, are you? Where are you from? Kansuke! Yes? Get lost! HOUSEN What the hell is your problem? Do you think you can toy with Housen, the Killer Corps? What makes you think you can just show up here? Speak up! Hey, it's been a while. I was just passing by, so I thought I'd drop in. I think it's okay. It's not like he's a stranger. YUKEN ODAJIMA 3RD YEAR STUDENT, HOUSEN ACADEMY Right? Hey, who the heck is that? MONJI TOKUYAMA (MONJI) 2ND YEAR STUDENT, HOUSEN ACADEMY Remember when I told you we rumbled with Oya High from SWORD when you were in the hospital after your bike accident? He's Fujio Hanaoka from that Oya High. -Excuse me! -What? By the way, before Fujio came here, he went to Suzuran to challenge them. No way! Holy crap! Are you for real? You're so nuts, it's incredible! No, I'm not that great. -That wasn't a compliment. -Don't tell me you went to see Rao. Right, I did. Then this guy Mashii told me to take a number and get in line if I wanted to meet Rao. That sounds like Mercy. -Hey, Sabakan! -Yes, sir! Fill this moron in! Roger! Hey! SUZURAN Suzuran has no leader. They are divided into several factions. There are not even ten members in the smallest faction, the Rao Faction. The Rao Faction is that small? They don't want any flunkies. I see. JUST SIX MEMBERS!? First, there's Kamui Ito, a sophomore who specializes in spy work. His trademark is his mask. KAMUI ITO 2ND YEAR STUDENT, SUZURAN HIGH Kansuke Seta is one of the best sophomore brawlers. KANSUKE SETA 2ND YEAR STUDENT, SUZURAN HIGH Both are on my kill list. Then there's the senior, Magoroku Yamaguchi. He always chews gum and used to be a lone wolf. After fighting Rao, he was named "Rao's Toughest Bodyguard." He gave me a hell of a kick. And the guy who let Fujio leave unharmed is the senior, Takehiko Mashii. His nickname is "Mercy." He's always calm and collected. He is Rao Faction's steadfast second in command. He's number two? He didn't get there because he's a good fighter. Suzuran is a school for morons, so he doesn't belong, but he's got a head on his shoulders. Another senior is Kozo Miyauchi. He's the toughest guy in Suzuran. No matter how much of a beating he takes, he gets back up like a zombie. That's why he is called "Binzo." Right! I fought him! I hit him hard a ton of times, but he just laughed it off. When it comes to the best fighters, that guy is only second to Rao. -Right, Shidaken? -What? The hell he is! Can't believe he would ever follow anyone. You have a guy like him too, right? -We do? -Lastly… MARIO MISAKI There are many legends about the most powerful man of Suzuran. Mario Misaki, aka Rao. "Mario"? Rao's name is Mario? Fujio! I'm telling you for your own good. Don't fight Rao. What? We are nothing in comparison to that guy. He's even a better fighter and a better man than Sachio, who absolutely hates to lose. Seriously? That makes me want to meet him even more… Say, where is Satchi anyway? Sachio is… Well… Something came up and he went abroad. What? He went abroad? His mom is really sick-- Sabakan! You don't need to give him all the details! I'm sorry! I see. Damn it! What the hell was with that damn Oya High dude! Hey. Why did you let him go? This makes Suzuran look weak. Shut up! Let me ask you this then. Any of you lame nerds have the balls to enter Oya High or even Housen alone? He's the only guy to try since Sachio Ueda from Housen did. He deserves respect for it. He came to see Rao, so he's our guest! We will handle this. -Are you for real? -Kamui! Yes, sir! Say something, man! Fujio Hanaoka of Oya High… Keep an eye on him. Roger. One more thing. Watch the other factions too. We can't let our guard down here at Suzuran! Seriously? You went to Housen and Suzuran alone? When will you learn? Didn't I tell you never to go to Suzuran? But to see Rao-- And don't ever try to see Rao! Listen! There are many terrifying legends about the monster Rao of Suzuran! Monster? So, what are the legends about this Rao dude? Hey! It's time for Jamuo's lecture on hooligan history! SHOHEI NAKAOKA 1ST YEAR STUDENT, OYA HIGH DAI NAKAGOSHI 2ND YEAR STUDENT, OYA HIGH It's lecture time! TSUJI 3RD YEAR STUDENT, OYA HIGH SHIBAMAN 3RD YEAR STUDENT, OYA HIGH Let's hear it! Okay! Listen up! Legend number one: The Kurosaki High punch fest! Legend number two: The highway closure incident! Legend number three. This is the big one! The destruction of Pub Ruby. When Rao was a freshman, he was at Pub Ruby on the outskirts of Toaru City. He got stinking drunk and told a guy, "Hey, drink!" "What?" "Are you refusing my offer?" Slam! He got into a huge fight with a guy at the bar! The bartender tried to stop it and other customers got involved! It was a huge brawl! Lots of people were hurt and the guy at the bar was half dead! And Pub Ruby… never opened its doors again. Liar! No freshman can get into a bar! At any rate, there are tons of legends about Rao! There are heaps of them. Wait! Then you make a legend too, Fujio! -Don't you dare! -Quit saying that! When you tell us to stop, it has the opposite effect. This is pointless! Tsukasa! Where's Tsukasa? What? He's not here yet? TSUKASA TAKAJO 3RD YEAR STUDENT, OYA HIGH Damn, I'm exhausted. Shit. I am so freaking late. What? Hey. YOSUKE TODOROKI 3RD YEAR STUDENT, OYA HIGH Nice work this morning. Since Murayama dropped out, all the schools in SWORD are vying for control. Knocking us out is the fastest way. What's wrong? I saw some dudes from Senomon over there. Senomon? Even from there, huh? We'll be in trouble if we don't stay alert. Hey. Where are you going? This is a hell of a group we've got here. Himuro and Gandhi, leaders of the massive Kamasaka High. Unbelievable. I never thought I'd work with you guys. From Ebara High, it's Kazami and Uenari, aka Fujin and Raijin. -As well as Sameoka. -Hey! Nobody lays a hand on Yosuke Todoroki. That dude is ours. I got it. We are working with both Kama High and Ebara High. Total control of SWORD is in our grasp. -Let's get this brawl started. -Right. We've got our troops and weapons ready. Weapons? That's so typical of Kama High. -Who asked you? Jerk! -Screw you! -Bring it on! -Enough! Get us more. -You don't trust we can do it, huh? -What's the use in trusting you guys? Power must be so complete that everyone is brought to their knees before you. You can't give anyone the slightest chance. All you give them… is fear. Just shut up and stick with me. I'll show you what it's like at the top. TO FUJIO Fujio! What's up? Sachio told me to give you this letter. What? A letter in this day and age? He's a stickler for this kind of thing. "Dear Fujio Hanaoka, I'm sure you've heard, but when you're reading this," I won't be in Toaru City. It's a family issue. I may not be back for a long time. The longer I'm gone, the more worried I am. It's times like this that quarrels usually happen. Fujio, if anything happens with Housen, I want you to help them. Naturally, we will help you if you also need it. Let's get together when I return. And please, don't go after Rao. "Don't even try." "Sachio Ueda." You'll never get rich with your head in the clouds. You know, Jamuo… Yes? Since I was born a man, "I've got to be the greatest," is what I've always thought. But that may not be what a truly strong man is. That guy never changes his mind. So you want to have him fight Fujio? Right… but I want to know about Rao first. That's so like you. Also, I was pretty surprised… that this guy is your pal. Hey. How's it going? Do you understand? -Well, I guess it makes sense. -Can you help us out? Wait. Hold on a sec. Can you clear something up? How did you become pals? I never told you? We're fishing pals. What? It's true. I never expected you guys to have fishing in common. Well, it was pure coincidence. We ran into each other at tackle shops and the river, so then we just hung out. He doesn't talk and I don't talk. We just sit in silence and fish. It's just… you know, relaxing. Unbelievable. Look. Seriously? Whether you believe it or not is your choice. -Seriously? -Seriously. No way. How long are you going to look? Give it back! Here. That's the place. If you want to know about Rao, the best person to see is Takehiko Mashii, aka Mercy. -Do you want me to get him? -No. Let me do this. It's good manners. Yes? Who are you? I'm Takajo of Oya High. Oya High? I want to know about Rao. Don't be ridiculous. Buzz off. I'm a close friend of Fujio Hanaoka who went to your school the other day. Wait there a sec. I don't have to tell you a thing about Rao. You're snooping around yourself. Your people are nosing around SWORD. You know it, right? You're good. Why do you want to know? There are many legends about the monster Rao, but most legends are exaggerations. Isn't that right? Is he someone my friend should fight with? Is he a man worthy of it? That's what I want to know. Hey, that shit is bad for you. SENOMON TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL Okay. But I'm broke right now. Okay. Hey, don't be like that, Mom! Okay. I know. I'll come to see you on my next break. Thanks. AKABOSHI STEEL WORKS Appreciate it, Motoaki. Thanks for driving us here. No problem. I come to Toaru City sometimes for deliveries. Thanks, Motoaki. Drop by the school and see us again. Sure thing! Later! Hey! Shut it slowly! -This way. -It's those guys! Mom. I'll call you back. Bye. KIKUYA KIMONO SHOP Not again, Mom! AMAHISA SABO Saboten? KASUMI HOUSE Look. That's Rao of Suzuran, the guy you've been wanting to meet. Really? Isn't this an orphanage? That's right. This is where Rao lives. Mario Misaki, aka Rao. With his umbilical cord still attached, he was wrapped in a flimsy towel, placed in a shopping bag, and was left at the doorstep of this orphanage. When he was little, he cried a lot and didn't talk much. One day, there was a fight at the orphanage. I said cut it out! Mario broke it up. He discovered in that fight that he was very strong. That's when his real fight started. Everything he has done has been to protect his little brothers and sisters. Their big, strong brother, Mario, is always there to help them, so they started calling him Rao. Then what about the legend about Pub Ruby? There was a boy two years younger than him. His father used to beat him. -So he was brought here. -Let me go! His father found out he was here and tried to drag him out. Let me go! The staff was able to stop him. Mom… But who would know when his abusive dad might come back? To make sure he never beat the boy again, Rao went out looking for him and found out he was at Pub Ruby. Don't you ever come back! That's the truth behind that legend. Understand? Scumbag! I'm sorry. I didn't know anything about the real truth. Hey! Fujio! Rao! What? Aren't you… I'm Fujio Hanaoka of Oya High. Be my friend. What? You're awesome. You're totally awesome! Now I know what the Housen guys meant. Please! Be my friend! But you're-- Okay? -Okay? -What's with you? Hey, shut up already! You shut up! -Hey! Shidaken! -Hey. Sorry for calling out of the blue. What do you want? Now, just chill. Let's just go inside. Okay? This way. Make way, you. Move it. We want to crush those big-shot assholes at Oya High who have been bossing everybody around. Housen and Oya fought, but things haven't been settled yet, right? So… you'll give me this money if Housen joins up with you? Good deal, right? Fine. What? What did you say? You became friends with Rao? -You liar! There's no way! -I'm serious! I did! Yes, it's the truth. Seriously? That Rao dude is that horrible monster! No, he's not! That guy is a real man. He's a total defender of justice! -Right! -And this stuff tastes awesome! -Motoaki, give me seconds! -Sure thing! -Give me seconds too! -Eat up! Here's a clean plate. -Can you afford to treat us? -No problem. There's this guy Zen at my workplace. A friend of his ordered too much. A ton of it was delivered and he asked if anyone wanted it, so I thought of you morons here. -Thanks, man! -This stuff is great, Motoaki! My pleasure! Look at you guys, chowing down on yakisoba. Do you want some too? I saw some Kama High dudes from the bus this morning. Kama High? What are they doing here? Isn't Kama High on the other side of Tendo Mountain? -Motoaki, I think I'll have some. -Okay! -Me too. -Okay. Have a seat. -Aren't you going to eat, Tsukasa? -No. You eat some too. Let me cook instead. It's okay. I've got a weak stomach. What? Well… It's way past the expiration date. Are you nuts or something? -This shit is rotten, you jerk! -You just said it was really good! Senomon and Kama High, huh? So, the leader of this alliance is… You? I'm Amagai of Senomon Tech. Let me know if it's not enough. Name your price. You guys, don't try to push Housen around. Saboten. You sure have sunk low since the last time we met. Don't ever show your face around me again. Right. Maybe I should give you a warning. You'll be sorry if you mess with Oya High. Later. Damn it! Are you sure you want to just let him leave? Unless he's silenced, he could leak this. Clean this up yourself! Come on! -Where's my car? -It's waiting. Something has been bothering me. You controlled Nami High, so why did you come to Senomon? And you even work for the spoiled son of the Amagai Group president. -You could-- -It's none of your business. Keep your nose out of it. Has my son been useful? Kohei, congratulations on transferring to Senomon Tech High School. You're making fun of me? It's my third transfer this year. I was able to get my son transferred to your new school this time. -Long time no see. -Right. That's Suzaki from Nami High! He's wearing our uniform! Hey. We will take control of this school. SENOMON TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL From now on, Amagai runs the show here. Understand? I'm Amagai. From now on, you guys are my tools. Thanks to you, Kohei, my son is very happy. My whole family thanks you for it. Sometimes, like old times-- Mr. Suzaki. We humans are destined to live in a hierarchical world. Either at the top or bottom. I'm a man who's at the top. Yes, sir. What are your plans for tomorrow? Oya territory. Odajima, your phone is ringing. Don't talk to me now! I'm sorry! Shit. Damn it, that jerk Odajima isn't answering. Hey. Hey, man. I told you never to show your face again. Why don't you tell me what you mean by that? What? You're good. No wonder you're expected to lead Housen next. You're strong. Thank you. Shidaken called. Ouch! So, Kama High and Senomon have been snooping around Oya High? Right. I can't help thinking that this doesn't bode well. Well, whoever tries something, I'll welcome them with this. Fujio! I'm serious about this. The way Oya High is now, they will do whatever you say. That means we could lose depending on what you do. Not everything can be solved with fists. Don't forget that Oya High isn't just you. -Get him! -Hold him! -Don't give up! -Get going, Sabakan! Hey! You punks! You guys… Listen up, Shidaken called me yesterday, but he doesn't answer now when I call. Does anyone know anything? Who was the last person who saw Shidaken yesterday? That's probably me. Did he say anything? No, he didn't. What the hell is this? Hey! What's with this bullshit traffic jam? Was there an accident or what? Holy shit! Run for your lives! Run! Nice! I like it! It never felt so good to stroll through Oya territory before! We're coming for you, Todoroki! It's Oya High hunting time. I'll stick with Suzaki. Saboten. You work with Kama High and Ebara High. Crush every last one of them! Roger. Okay! Let's kick some ass! They're coming! -I'm sorry. -You better be! -Man… -What's taking so long? That yakisoba has messed with my stomach. You too, Kiyoshi? Is it true… that chicks don't like mohawks? How should I know? This mohawk is why chicks don't dig me, right? -Who cares? My stomach hurts! -Why does it hurt? -Doesn't yours hurt? -No. How… Hey! Are you okay, man? Well, if it isn't Yasukiyo. Gandhi! It's time to hunt Oya High scum! Hey. Isn't that Fujin? Good morning, everybody! Take a swim! Time for you scum to take the plunge! Senomon! -Are you okay? -Stop them! Wait, Nakaoka! Don't chase them! Shit. We should have been a little more careful. And it looks like it isn't just Senomon Tech. Jamuo. Yes? Fujio and I will handle this. Look for your chance to escape. But-- The way things look, they've got the whole town covered. They've got a huge gang here. Here we go! Tsuji and Shibaman. Found you! It's just the two bodyguards. Hey, bodyguards! Where is your damn leader, Todoroki? How should I know? We're not always with him. Then we will kill you instead. Get them. Listen. Figure out what's up and regroup our forces. Got it! It's Nakagoshi and Nakaoka of the Chuchu Faction. Shut the hell up, Saboten! How dare you Senomon losers pull this crap on Oya High! This won't turn out well for you! I've always hated your guts. Nakagoshi! Are you okay? Fujio Hanaoka! Looks like I won first prize. Are you sure it's a win? That's for me to decide. That hurts! I hate assholes who bring weapons to a fight. Winning is what counts. That's all. Suzaki of Nami High? Pull yourself together! Let's go! What are you doing, Kiyoshi? If we all get our asses kicked, who will get revenge? Don't be stupid! You have friends besides me at Oya High! Just open up! -Bring them with you! -Open up! There they are! -Go, you guys! -Kiyoshi! Just go! Go! Yasushi! It's all in your hands now! Kiyoshi! Get them! Hey, man. Looks like you lost. Damn you! It's not over yet. Stop wasting time on this chump. Sorry, but we couldn't finish off the Chuchu Faction. Gandhi couldn't either. What? Don't give me that crap. What about Fujio Hanaoka? I don't know. -Bring him. -Yes, sir. We will use him as bait to lure out those morons. Then we won't have to look for them. OYA HIGH SCHOOL Fujio! You made it out okay? Thanks to Motoaki, I got away. Where's Tsukasa? Damn it! It wasn't just Senomon. Kama High and Ebara High worked with them. Alone, they were no big deal. But there were heaps of them. And the others? Nakagoshi sacrificed himself for me. The same goes for Kiyoshi. Also… I can't get hold of Tsuji or Shiba. And Doroki? What about Todoroki? Hey! Haven't you found Todoroki yet? No. We have looked everywhere but can't find him. Hurry up and find him, damn it! Yes, sir! Hey! You're looking for me? Fujio, what should we do? Maybe I wasn't meant to be… the leader of Oya High. What? What are you talking about? If it had been Satchi… or Tsukasa… this wouldn't have happened. Don't forget that Oya High isn't just you. They've got the whole town covered. Figure out what's up and regroup our forces. You're the leader of Oya High! I'm sorry. Give me some time by myself. Hey. Hey, you had some good friends. But that stuff is all nonsense. You grow weak when you've got something to protect. You don't need friends to be strong. What's so funny? If you were captured, I bet nobody would come to rescue you. We will finish off Oya High tomorrow. Hey Suzaki, does he have some kind of dirt on you? He must. Otherwise, why would you work for him? Seriously? So you've known him since you were kids? Suzaki's dad had a company, but it went bankrupt. My dad's company bought it, so now he's our chauffeur. He depends on us for money. So that guy's been my tool since way back. Your tool, huh? There are some Kiri High guys outside. Saboten. -Summon the tools. -Right. Got it. Thanks. Keep the change. Do your job. Am I a tool? I thought we could be friends. Everyone who works for me basically wants money. Even you. -I-- -I can't trust a friend! All I need are tools. We could lose depending on what you do. Not everything can be solved with fists. Hey. Let's drop out of this. This three-school alliance is total crap. It's too late for that now! You two just want to fight Todoroki, right? Todoroki isn't what he used to be. He's Todoroki of Oya High now. I see. So that's what it is. This sure is a roundabout way to get to me. -I see you're ready to fight. -However… If I win this fight, you drop out of that alliance. -I don't know… -Okay! -It's a deal. -Hey, Sameoka! It's a good deal. I'll be the judge. Okay. It's a deal. Okay. By the way, was it you guys who beat up Tsuji and Shibaman? You're dead. Getting hospitalized from a fight? Talk about being immature! I'm sorry. The kid in the ICU is still in a coma. He doesn't have an ID either, so there's nothing we can do. Hey! You lie back down! Sorry, but that guy in a coma might be a friend of mine. Where are you going? I'll go after them alone. Wait a little longer! Forget that! I can't stand just sitting here anymore! Fujio! Fujio, where did you go? Sorry, guys. Doroki. Was it those alliance jerks? Ebara High dropped out. They won't fight us again. Next time, come to me directly. You know… you have changed. Right. You may be right. Now… I've got friends to protect. Seriously. My leaders had a huge influence on me. Hello? Who's this? Hey! Kiyoshi! Did the doctor check you out? Okay. What? Shidaken of Housen? Yasushi, give me the phone. Todoroki here. What's with Shidaken? Okay. Where? It's Tsukasa. Tsukasa! Are you all right? That's a good question. I don't think he is. Why you… It's all over for the former top dogs, Oya High. Screw you. Tomorrow, bring all your people who ran away today. We will be waiting. I will! You can count on it. Are we going then? Yes. All right! Let's kick their asses! -All right! -All right! Even with Ebara High out, nothing's really changed. We are all that's left of our forces. It would be stupid to attack them head-on. Right now… the best thing to do is figure out how to rescue Tsukasa. Hey! Sounds like your friends will come and save you tomorrow. Nice. That is if they can even get this far. How can we know? What? How can we know unless we try? I doubt Tsukasa even wants us to come save him. Hey! They won't come to save me. -What? -What? They will come to kill you. We are simple people at Oya High. No matter the situation, we fight because it's all we can do now. Just the will to fight won't cut it this time. You need to use your head! Todoroki. It will be easier with Ebara High out. That's all we needed. Thank you. What is this all about? Does this mean you don't need me anymore? Of course not. It means that for a friend, I'm willing to swallow my pride. Please. Will you help us? We became friends through fighting. You guys here are not our only comrades! Did you… Since they have built an alliance… then we will show them what a real alliance is. OYA HIGH SCHOOL Hey, Jinjin. Don't call me that. Don't get the wrong idea. They beat up our Shidaken too. Besides… Well, how do I put this? If Sachio was here, I'm sure he would do the same thing. How is Shidaken? He came out of the coma this morning, but he's in really bad shape. What happened? Your face is in pretty bad shape too. It's nothing! Your friend has been captured, right? -Make way! -Yes, sir! Let's do this! -Yes! -Yes! -It's party time! -Yes! What? Ebara High is not coming? That doesn't matter. All that's left are their dregs. Hey! They're here. -Let's go! -Yes! Let's do this! SWORD's going to be ours! Bring it on! Why the hell is Housen here? Those fricking baldies. Fujio. Give the signal. Let's go, you assholes! Crush them! Yasushi! Let's do this! Welcome, everybody. Your friend is in the gym. Get to the gym if you can! Let's go! Fujio! There are too many here. Take another route! -Let's go! -Roger! They're here! Out of the way! Yes! Go for it! It's the Housen locomotive! Hey. Bring your troops and come to Senomon. If you don't want your other arm busted, then do your job! Go! Get out there, damn it! -How much longer will you run, Gandhi? -Shut up, moron! Who are you calling a moron? -What? Hey! -Hey! Shit! -Shit! What's going on? -This is screwed up! Pull! Hey! You guys! Find another way in! Are you okay? Watch out! You better watch your head. Looks like they led us into a trap. They totally duped us! There's no end to them! Greetings! The Housen Killer Corps is here. What took so long? Don't be like that. There's plenty more work to be done. Let's go! Don't mess with Oya High! Kill them! Let's go! Fujio! Leave this to us! I'm here for revenge! Those dudes… We have arrived. We're almost there, Tsukasa! Wait! Hey! Odajima! Saboten. That must be Amagai of Senomon. Suzuran! What is Suzuran doing here? Rao… Hey, Suzuran! This is none of your business! Yes, it is. Fujio is my friend. Understand? So the Rao Faction of Suzuran is in this fight too. Seriously? You must be morons! What can just six people do? You know what? Just me alone would be enough! Kill them all now. Let's get this rumble rolling! What are you looking at? Ko! Hey Suzaki! Beat the crap out of everyone who gets inside. Hey. Do your job. Hey. Leave this to us. You attack the castle. Fujio! Get in there! -Let's go! -Let's go! Tsukasa! First, rescue Tsukasa. Right! You're the one who beat Tsukasa, right? Right. Odajima! I got this. Go! What a bunch of losers. Both you and Oya High can go to hell. Are you okay? Man, I think all my bones are broken. I'll take care of him. Your fight is with me. So… You're the one who beat Shidaken, right? I forgot. Todoroki… Take care of the rest. Shit, here we go. -Looks like we got them all here. -Right. Hey, did you even fight? You better believe it! I hadn't punched someone in a long time. Do it. Seriously. I just got back home. No way! What are you doing here? Has it already started inside? Yes! Get him! SACHIO UEDA 3RD YEAR STUDENT, HOUSEN ACADEMY Who are these guys? The enemy's reinforcements. I see. I've got dibs… on kicking your ass. Hey! Looks like you're getting your asses kicked. You're a disgrace to Toaru City. What is Suzuran doing here? Is that the best the four emperors of Housen can do? Binzo! Chew on this and take a break. What the hell are you doing here? Did you really think you could beat me? Let go of me! Hurts, doesn't it? Fooled you! You're under arrest. Be more careful who you fight. I'll make sure you get the bed next to Shidaken. Apologize while you're there. Hey! Suzaki! What's taking you so long? Finish him off! Just two of them left, huh? What? Don't be stupid! I've still got lots of troops! We have finished up. I think we went a bit overboard. They all ran off. That's awesome. Suzuran are not the only ones! Housen is here too! Damn, that fight ate up a lot of calories. This kind of thing is fun once in a while, right? Hey. You're in a fight, man. Why the hell isn't he answering? Hey! Don't be so lame! You guys have lost! Hey, you guys! Go and get them! I paid you, so do your job! Do your job, damn it! Hey! It's not over yet. Suzaki… All right. Then I'll end it. This Senomon dude is pretty good. We've got tons like him at our school. Seriously… In their condition, how can they keep that up? Man… why is Suzaki fighting for that jerk? To Suzaki… he's more than that. Hey Ryo! Ko! What's with the bat? Those guys who bullied you, I beat the crap out of them. You did? He won… He won! I won! You saw it! I won! You saw that, right? Why did you do it? Do I need a reason? We're friends, after all. I won! The hell you did! Hey… The next one decides it. I won't lose. I'll get strong. I'll get strong and protect you, Ko! Cool! We will both become the greatest! Yes! Let's take in the view from the top! The greatest… will be Senomon! I'm sorry. I won't let you be the greatest. I lost? I lost? No, that can't be. Fujio! Why did you do that? What's your problem? You know you shouldn't use… that kind of thing! We're going to take in that view… that belongs to us. I've always stuck with you because I believed we would, but you don't remember, do you? I'm sorry… I couldn't succeed. Oya High… truly is tough. From now on… we will be tools of Oya High. What are you talking about? You lost once. That's all. We fought to see who's the greatest, but who cares who's on top and who isn't? You've got friends around you who will fight for you. Isn't that enough? Looking down from the sky, you can see we are all down here together. Hey… Let's start over again. Will you be my friend? Ko… That's so stupid. We lost this time, but I swear we will destroy you. Ryo and I, together. Damn it, don't cry. I'm sorry. Jinkawa! Okay! I'm beat. You… You're a tough one. Let's do this again. Okay! Nice work! -We are leaving! -Yes, sir! You had me worried, Fujio! Damn it. We can't even see the sky. You and I… Let's start over again. Do you know what Rao said? That was the first time anyone ever asked him to be friends. He doesn't look like it, but that made him happy. Tell your boss I said thanks. Will do. Fujio. Sachio? What? Sachio! Hey! It's Sachio! The second I get back, I'm already busy. Hey! Satchi! Hey. You're kidding. What is Suzuran doing here? You told me not to, but I just had to meet Rao. And now we're friends! It's been a while, Sachio. Rao! Let's fight sometime soon. Me too. I want another chance. Yes! All three of us can fight! It won't cause trouble for anyone. Sachio! Welcome home. All right, let's all go back. This isn't expired either, is it? I've already eaten it. You know, you haven't changed a bit. -Is it expired? -No! It's just fine! What did you just say? Meiwa Girls High School invited us to a singles mixer! Nakaoka and I were invited but there are four more spots! Yes! Let's decide this way! There are four aces in this deck of cards. Whoever finds an ace gets to go to the mixer! Look! Go get it! Go! There it is! Go! We are stupid morons who are savage and crude. We are good-for-nothings covered in bandages. Some people probably mock us. Some people probably even flip the bird and spit on us. Even so, I don't care. We just want to be who we are. We will never be untrue to ourselves and we will live life the way we want to. What about you? Hey! He says he wants to fight you again. Our Fujio is very popular, so you need to take a number. That's your number. Subtitle translation by: Brian Athey
