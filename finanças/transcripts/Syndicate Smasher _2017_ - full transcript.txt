(dramatic music) (dramatic music) (upbeat music) - Foxtrot Six, come in. Foxtrot Six, do you read me? - [Dasha] I read you loud and clear. - What's your 20? - I'm four klicks northeast of the drop off point. (upbeat music) - Got you right in my sights, Foxtrot Six. I'm 40 meters at your five o'clock. - I don't see any convoy. Where the hell is it? - These are the coordinates we were given. - Well it's not here, we got bad intel. - I was told directly by the boss man himself. - Wait a minute, I see something. (sinister music) At my three o'clock, 200 meters. - There you are, fucker. I just made visual confirmation. You're right on top of the target. - I see him. I'll take him. - Wait for backup. They don't show, we abort the mission. I'm not dying over 100 grand. (suspenseful music) - Sorry, I gotta pay off my Ferrari. - Hey wait! (rifle booming) - Sniper! (speaking in foreign language) - You crazy-- (rifle booming) (rifle booming) (soldier grunting) (assault rifle booming) (rifle booming) (soldier grunting) (rifle booming) (soldier grunting) (pistol booming) (rifle booming) (soldier grunting) (pistol booming) (assault rifle booming) (pistol booming) (assault rifle booming) (pistol booming) (pistol booming) (speaking in foreign language) - What now? - [Soldier] Freeze, hands up! Hands behind your head! - [Soldier] Drop it, don't be a hotshot. (speaking in foreign language) - [Soldier] Don't move! Don't fucking move! - Hold your fire. Who the fuck are you? Who hired you, huh? - Your mother. (fist thumping) (grunting) - My mother, huh? Take these motherfuckers. (speaking in foreign language) - [Soldier] Get your ass up, move it! (suspenseful music) - This is it, lovebirds. Last stop. Don't fuck up in your next lifetime. Send them to their maker. (rifle bolts clicking) (dramatic music) (machine gun bolt clicking) (machine gun booming) (guns booming) (bullets thudding) (machine gun booming) (guns booming) - Take cover, take cover! (bullets whining and thudding) (fists thumping) (bullets thudding) (machine gun booming) - Move, move! (rocket exploding) - [Soldier] Bazooka! (machine gun booming) (guns booming) (assault rifle booming) (machine gun booming) (rifle booming) (assault rifle booming) (guns booming) (guns booming) (guns booming) (speaking in foreign language) - [Soldier] Keep firing, keep firing! (guns booming) (guns booming) (guns booming) (speaking drowned out by gunfire) (guns booming) (guns booming) (explosion booming) - [Soldier] Move, move, move! (rocket hissing) (guns booming) (bullets thudding) (guns booming) (guns booming) (flamethrower hissing) (men screaming) (guns booming) (explosions booming) (dramatic music) (pistol hammer clicking) (pistol booming) (upbeat music) (car engine rumbling) - Come get your bread. No thanks, no gratitude? - 'Til next time. - Thank you, Mother. - I know the one. - Yeah, we had a great time. - She always talks too much. - (laughing) That's not nice! - I know, but it's true. - And then I came here 'cause I wanted to see you. - I love seeing you. I love the time we have together. - Me too, so stop watching the television. I think I can distract you. - And I like those lips. - Well then give 'em to me. (sinister music) - Business in our own backyard? I don't know, Jack. And I don't hit civilians, you know that. - [Theresa] Hey Jack. - Hey Theresa. - I'll see you next Thursday. - Okay, Babe, I look forward to it. - Okay, Baby. - This man is no civilian, not by your definition. - What's the other job? - Same people. They just want us to make an exchange. They pay us half after the first job, half after the second. - Does Dasha trust these people? - We know they have money. - How much? - 300,000. - 300K? For one man? He must be very important. How many people is gonna take to do this job? - He's an easy mark. Man lives by himself, he has no protection. - Wife, children? - He'll be all alone. - Hmm. Have you talked to Dasha and Dara about it? - Not yet. - You need to do that. - I'll make the call. (uneasy music) I checked it out already. The house isn't under his name, it's under the city's. It's confiscated property, probably seized by the police. - Hmm. Where's his real residence? - He hasn't been living in his own residence for four months. - Means they're hiding him out. They know there's a contract out on him. - What do you think, too risky? - No, we're gonna do it. Is that him? - Yeah, that's him, let's go. - No, no, let him get inside. I want it to be quiet. (car alarm beeping) (dramatic music) - Let's rock and roll, guys. - Okay. What do you think? Yeah, I'll be there! I'll, alright! (silenced pistol booming faintly) (pistol booming) (silenced pistol booming faintly) (pistol booming) (silenced pistol booming faintly) (pistol booming) (guns booming) (silenced pistol booming faintly) (pistol booming) (bullets thumping) Come get me mother fuckers! (silenced pistols booming faintly) (pistol booming) (silenced pistol booming faintly) - Let's roll. (uneasy music) - Mr. Dippolito, do you have any comment on the verdict? - Today's a great day. Justice has finally been served. - Mr. Dippolito, can you please-- - You can address me. My client would like me to be his spokesperson for the time being. - Is it true that the judge declared a mistrial in the case? - Yes, it's true. My client has been cleared of all charges, just like we knew he would be. - Because of the death of the prime witness against him? - We are truly saddened of the death of Mr. Manzella. He was a dear friend of my client. But his testimony would be totally irrelevant in this case. - Leo Manzella was murdered, was he not? - That investigation is still pending and has absolutely nothing to do with this case whatsoever. - But your client benefited from his death, did he not? - We have no further comments at this time. My client would like to go back to his quiet life. We ask that the press and media please respect his right for privacy. (hands clapping) - That was a great performance back there, Rusty. I am impressed. We know you're the one that had him clipped. - [Attorney] Excuse me, this is harassment. Please leave now! - How did you know? I mean, I didn't even know where he was. Who told you? Who do you know on the inside? - [Attorney] That's it, I'm going straight to your superiors. We're filing a harassment suit against you. - Don't worry, Rusty. I'll nail you next time. - Have a nice day, Detective. (sinister music) - Detective Driscoll, how did you find out-- - Get out of my face! Bitch. - Did you get that? (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - That was Detective Carol Driscoll, who led the investigation into the murder case against alleged rackets boss Russell "Rusty" Dippolito, who has been released after a mistrial. - Rita, was it because of the death of Leo Manzella? - Yes, as you know, Leo Manzella, whose testimony was crucial in the conviction of Dippolito, was murdered while-- - Russell Dipplolito. - He was under the protection of local law enforcement. Why wasn't he-- - This is not good. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - Now what the hell is the holdup? - They're stealing from us. They don't wanna pay the full amount. - No problem, guys. My boss will have the rest of the money after you do this other job on our behalf. - Listen, the deal was half now and half after the second job. Tell your boss we're not people that you want to stiff, I can guarantee you that. Now, where's the 150 grand you owe us? - When Mr. Kryukov gives orders, he doesn't ask twice. - [Milan] Well neither do I. - Take the money. We'll give you the rest after the job. All you have to do is make an exchange for us. - What kind of exchange is this anyway? Why can't your people do it? - Easy job. We give you package, you give package to the people. They will give you money, and you bring money back to us. Easy. - What's in the package? I'm gonna ask you once more, what's in the package? Smack, coke? That's what I thought. We make the exchange and the risk falls on us. - We'll give you the details later. Expect a call tonight. Have a good one. (speaking in foreign language) - Hey, Khrushchev. Don't let your mouth overload your ass. Your pathetic threats mean nothing to us. - I don't know about this. I don't wanna get caught up in some dope deal. It's too risky. - That's why they sent us out. In case there's a bust, they walk away clean while we go to prison. - Kryukov's people are not gonna pay us. You know they're gonna smoke us after we do this for them. - I say we take what we have and we move on. - These maggots have no idea who they've crossed. - Look, I know what you're thinking, alright. We go head to head with these people, we're looking for some big problems. Maybe we cut our losses. - No, nobody steals from us, nobody. I don't care who they are, one way or another we're gonna get the money that they owe us. Are we agreed? - Agreed. - Yeah. - I have a bad feeling about this. (sinister music) (dramatic music) - So what's the word? - They're flyin' in next week. - Shit! What the fuck do they want? That's all I need is for them to be breathing down my back. - They wanna sit down. Manzella was one of Broncato's people in St. Louis. After what happened, happened, Broncato went runnin' to Chicago. - Broncato is a chicken shit! Goes running to Scozzari like some little sissy instead of settling things like a man. - We're supposed to get permission from Chicago before we clip anyone from another family. - Permission? Manzella was a rat! Besides, this is my own backyard. Who the fuck do they think they are coming over here and telling us what to do? You don't see me going to Chicago and telling Scozzari how to run his business. - Well listen, all the Midwest families, Chicago, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Detroit, Kansas City, Broncato from St. Louis, they're all gonna be here. Look Boss, we gotta problem we gotta solve. Let's solve it before it's a problem that's gonna bite us in the ass. - No, absolutely not. I'm not going to the DA or Judge Patterson about this. Wiretaps are out of the question. - Chief, this is the only chance we have. Look, I don't know about you, but I know he had Manzella whacked, and Paulie Amandre, and Tommy Shartino. Every potential witness we had against him! These guys were under our protection. Our protection. In undisclosed locations. How did they Dippolito find him? - Enough of this shit, Carol. - You know what I think? I think there are leaks right here in the department. Someone or, I don't know, some people here are on the take. - It's over. Leave the man be. He's a harmless old has been, he's gonna croak in a few years. We've got bigger fish to fry. - Oh, that is bullshit! He's smarter than you and he's certainly smarter than me. How do you think he's run things for so long? - I'm not wasting any more of the department's resources investigating some penny ante operator. - Penny ante? Nothing legal or illegal goes on in this city without this guy pulling the strings, and you know it. - Dippolito's attorney just contacted me. - Oh shit. - This is the third harassment complaint they filed against not only you, but the whole department. - Are you gonna let this weasel intimidate you? - I'm getting shit from upstairs over this. I mean it, move on! - He's clever. Boy, is he clever. But he slips, he always slips. And I am gonna catch him when he does. (upbeat music) - Where's Kryukov? - Relax, he sent me to broker the deal. - Dippolito said we're supposed to meet with Kryukov's people. - We represent Kryukov. - Bullshit. We talk to Kryukov directly or no deal. - Oh cut the crap. You wanna make the deal or not? I got the goods right here. But you gotta show me the money. - I call Russell Dippolito first to find out what the hell is going on here! - Then do it! (speaking in foreign language) - Yes. - Hey, Dippolito, what's going on here? Huh? Okay, okay? (speaking in foreign language) Hey, not yet. My man's going to test the merchandise. - Be my guest. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - Now that's what I'm talkin' about. (rifle booming) (glass shattering) (pistol booming) (pistol booming) (wheezing) - Hey, what took you so long? - Hey Billy. - What? - Guess what I just did? I just got off the phone with the DA's office about possible approval for a wiretap on Dippolito. - You're going over Darcy's head? - [Carol] Mmhmm. - I think that's a bad idea. You know he's gonna find out about this. - Yeah, I know. whatever. Anyhow, the judge hasn't approved yet. So I'm just hoping that Johnson at the DA's office gets back to me first before he goes to Darcy, or they're gonna be using me as target practice. - [James] Driscoll. - Yeah, hey! How ya doin'? What's up? - I have a case I was wishin' you'd help me with. - What is it? - I have three dead Japanese nationals. They were murdered at the Overland Hotel in Downtown. - Murdered? So, what are you tellin' me for? You know I can't help you. Take those ballet slippers and go pirouette down to homicide. - Well, I would except I just got off the phone with the Bureau and it seems that these three Japanese nationals have extensive criminal records and they're also highly connected in the drug trafficking in their home country of Japan. - You know nothing goes on down here without Dippolito taking part in the action. Might strengthen your case for a wiretap if we can tie it to him. (uneasy music) - Ain't none of us going back home now. I hope it was worth it. - Jack, it'll be okay. We have 2.5 million in cash and another 12 kilos of pure China white smack. Now on the street, that's another 2.5 million. We're gonna make it okay. - Yeah, but that's only if we live long enough to enjoy the fruits of our labor. - We gotta leave town as soon as possible. - Okay, well what about the smack? We can't just dump it on eBay. - I have a contact we can talk to. - This is big, let's do it right away. We gotta move that stuff fast. You know Dippolito's gangsters are looking for us everywhere. - Yeah, but he's not gonna find us. - That's right, we gotta stick together. (jet engines whining) (dramatic music) - Hello. - Well hello yourself. - We've been expecting you guys. Come on, follow me. Come on, this way. - Pick up the tickets, drop 'em off at the club. I'll be here all day. Yeah, I gotta go. Bye. - [Rebecca] Hi. - Hey Baby. Dasha, Baby, Sweetheart, how are ya? You look good. I knew you couldn't stay away from me. - In your dreams! - In my dreams? What about the night in Kabul? - We want to talk business. - Okay, everybody have a seat. I'm Andy. - Can I get you guys something to drink before we get started? - No thank you, dear. Andy, no disrespect to you, but we're really pressed for time and I'd appreciate it if we could really get a move on quick as possible. - Okay, whaddya got for me? - You know what this is? Pure H. - Whaddya out of your fucking mind? What are you bringin' this shit into my club for? What's wrong with you? What are these guys, cops? You guys are cops? You know, by law, if I ask you for badges you gotta tell me you're cops. - They're not cops. They're not cops, you idiot. We want to make an exchange. - This is like fucking entrapment here. - Andy, Andy! Look at me, do I look like a freaking cop to you? I'm not a cop, I just wanna move this deal as soon as possible. It'll make you rich. - Andy, can I speak with you privately, please? Excuse us. - You're out of your fucking mind bringing this shit in my club. Excuse me. What? - I think we should hear what they have to say. - What you are you fucking taking crazy pills, too? What's wrong with you? You want that shit in our fucking club? - Look, no! I'm not crazy about this either, but this is the exact kinda deal we're been looking for. Just think about it. - [Andy] You're nuts. You know all the bullshit that's gonna come down with this? - [Rebecca] Look, tell 'em 30%. - I can't believe you brought this shit in my club. I really can't. Hypothetically, if I was interested in this briefcase, what would be my cut? (dramatic music) - Vladimir, we've got a problem here, and this your responsibility. - I know, you're right. We're here to set things right. - You came to me, you wanted in on the action. So I introduced you to my friends. This is how you repay me? You make me look like a jackass? - These were not my people. - Jesus Christ, this is good stuff. - Why did you use outsiders? (speaking in foreign language) Do we have a trust issue here? - No, no, no. - Well, these clowns, they killed three of Mr. Nagai's men. How are we gonna compensate him for that? (speaking in foreign language) (shouting) - Just money. This is the same amount that they stole from Mr. Nagai. We do what we have to do to keep our business together. - And the merchandise? - They stole it from me, so I'm in charge of that. (speaking in foreign language) - Hey, you got Dippolito, the Russians, and the Yakuza all workin' together. - You got the judge to sign off on this, right? - Um, no, not exactly, why? - What do you mean, not exactly? - You know, come on he was taking too long. - Ah shit! You were supposed to wait for Judge Patterson to sign off on the wiretaps. They're gonna have my badge, Driscoll. If Darcy finds out I wired this place, we're both up the creek. - Don't worry, okay? You're in the clear. Trust me, officially you were never here. I don't see you anywhere. Your name's never gonna come up. And if anybody asks any questions, I am fully responsible and acted alone. (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - This is bullshit. The guys that were killed were men of importance back home. We can't trust you anymore. - What else can I do to solve the problem? - We all know how this has to be handled. - You know what you gotta do. If you want our business to continue, Vladimir, you take care of those pieces of shit. - You're crazy! Is this worth it? Why put your job on the line for this guy? - Because Russell Dippolito had Detective Ronald Trumonti whacked, that's why. - Oh yeah, I heard about that. It was about nine years ago? - 10 and a half. - [Billy] Before I transferred here? - Yep. - It was a hung jury on that case, if I remember. - Ronnie wasn't just my partner, he was my life, he was my everything. He loved my father very much, he spent all his time with him when he could. They both loved opera. My dad got sick, had a cardiac arrest, Ronnie was right there at the hospital. (mumbling) You see this locket that I wear? These are Ronnie's ashes. I never take it off. - Jesus. I'm sorry. - Did you know that the jury was bought in that case? Dippolito walked away scot-free. Just waltzed away. That's why one way or another I am going to nail that son of a bitch. (solemn music) - (speaking in foreign language), welcome. I'd like to thank everybody for comin'. Now some of you know each other and some of yous don't. So I'm gonna introduce everybody. This is Julie Matranga from Cleveland. Nick Adrizzone from Kansas City. - Gentlemen. - My friend from Detroit, Jack Abate. Carl Disimone from Milwaukee. And from St. Louis, Ralph Broncato. I think everybody's familiar with Russell Dippolito and Frank Giordano from the L.A. Family. Now we all know why we're here. So does anybody wanna open up the meeting? Anyone? - Leo Manzella, he was with me. You hit one of my guys without permission. That's like a slap in the face. - Fuck Manzella. Your boy was gonna rat on me. I got a right to protect myself. And what the fuck was he doing out here anyway? - The point is, none of our people are supposed to be clipped without all of us agreeing. - Ah, don't give me that shit, Julie. You wanna talk about the rules, let's talk. - Broncato had his people out here running around in my backyard without my permission. Just like all the rest of you. - Rusty, this was the arrangement we had with Fuenzi. - Fuenzi's gone. I'm the boss now. And I'm gonna start doing things by the book out here. All of you guys, you got people runnin' around out here doing things behind my back, like I'm half a fag. If my guys came to St. Louis or to Chicago they'd be clipped so fast that they wouldn't know what hit 'em. - Hey Rusty, you're outta line talkin' like that. Show some appreciation here. You know, the only reason your in office is because we put you there, capisce? - You voted for me because you thought I was gonna be in your pocket. Well, you were wrong. - Listen, you're under us. Everything from Pennsylvania to the West Coast belongs to Chicago. You're out here working for us, understood? - That's what I wanna talk to you about. I'm the boss now. Things are gonna change around here. I don't want Chicago representing us no more. - What are you talkin' about here, Rusty? - My boys, we can stand on our own two feet. I want a seat on the commission. - Rusty, come on! That'll never happen. Never in a million years. - I say we take a vote on it next time around. (speaking in foreign language) - Vote? What vote? There ain't gonna be no vote. You wanna piss on us? You wanna start a war with all of us? - I got Rick Obono in Pittsburgh, I got the Tampa Family, and all five families in New York. They're all behind me on this. You make a move against me, you move against them. - You say you got the whole East Coast, but where are they? They haven't even sent an emissary. - Hey Rusty, don't do this thing. It's not gonna be good for nobody. It's not gonna be good for you, and it's not gonna be good for us. Now we ain't like our goombas out in New York that leave their dead on the street. We make 'em disappear. Remember what happened to Hoffa in Detroit? - I'm just sayin' what's gonna happen eventually. But for now, I don't want any of you comin' out here unless I say so. - (speaking in foreign language) That's a crock of shit. If I catch any of your boys on the street, I'm shippin' 'em back to you in caskets. - Hey Rusty, one more thing. (speaking in foreign language) Pay attention. Watch your back. (speaking in foreign language) This stupid, fucking (speaking in foreign language). Who the hell's he think he is? - What is it? - We got someone here that might be able to help us. - Hello, Mr. D. I got some information that I think you might wanna know. - We trust this guy? - No. But right now he's the only connection we have. - If we can't trust him why are we here? - Let's just see what happens. (speaking in foreign language) - Okay. (pistol chamber clicking) (engine revving) (tires squealing) (pistols booming) (machine gun booming) (pistol booming) (man grunting) - [Dasha] One of Kryukov's men. (speaking in foreign language) - Move away. (pistol booming) Let's go. (pistol booming) (mobile phone buzzing) - Hello. - This must be Rusty. - Who's this? How'd you get this number? - [Milan] I can find any number, anything, anytime. Don't bother calling your corrupt cops down at the precinct. They won't be able to trace this number. - Who the fuck is this? - I'm the one you ordered a hit on. Yeah, that's right, I'm still walkin'. Those Russian clowns you sent couldn't even tie their own shoelaces. They're all dead. And you didn't have the guts to come yourself or send your own people. You're goin' down, Rusty. - Listen you stupid son of a bitch, do you know who I am? If you did, you wouldn't be making this phone call right now. You should have left town a long time ago. - I know who you are. You're nobody. A self-made man who admires his maker. And news flash, I'm not going anywhere. But I will meet you soon. You're not gonna know where, you're not gonna know when, you're not gonna know how. You're a dead man. (pounding on door) - Hold on. It's open, come in. Oh hi, James. - Hi. - Hi, how are you doin'? - You know, you really should get to know Davis down there in the Bureau. - Yeah? I give up, who is it? - That is Jack Samson. He is a former Marine, Recon outfit. Has a minor criminal record. - Minor? So why were the feds tailin' him then? - Well the feds weren't tailin' him. That picture was taken of those two coming out of The Odessa Lounge. Now, we both know that The Odessa Lounge is the unofficial headquarters of Vladimir-- - Kryukov's... - Outfit. - Shit. - The FBI still has an investigation pending on Mr. Kryukov. - You're not gonna believe this. I recorded a meeting. No, listen to me, listen to me. I recorded a meeting he had with Dippolito. They talked about whacking some outsiders for the killing of the three Japanese victims in the Overland Hotel. - Look. - This is him! - I didn't hear that, okay, okay? - So, uh, who's the Playmate? - Our damsel is Dasha Federovich. She's a Russian immigrant. The FBI did some digging on her. She's been in the country three years. Oh, you're gonna love this. - I better. - She was a female member of the Russian Special Forces. - Female Russian Forces? Oh Jesus Christ, I love that! A couple of cowboys! Oh shit, if they go after Dippolito, anyone connected to him, this town is gonna be one big shooting gallery. - Nuh-uh-uh-uh-uh! - [Carol] What? - And, uh, you never got any of this information from me, right? I was not here. - No, of course not. No, no, never. I never saw you, you were never here. Hey, James, thank you. - I need you to leave town now. - What about you? - I never ran from a fight before and I'm not gonna do it now. - Dippolito and the Russians are not gonna go down easy either. - All hell's gonna be breaking loose. - You don't think we're gonna leave all the fun to you, do you? - Something's comin' down, it's gonna be hot. - Okay. - Don't know exactly when, but you guys gotta be ready. - Okay, don't worry about it Boss. I'll handle it. I'll gather the troops, get 'em ready for war. (dramatic music) (silenced pistol booming faintly) (silenced pistol booming faintly) (man grunting) (silenced pistol booming faintly) (silenced pistol booming faintly) (silenced pistol booming faintly) (pistol booming) (silenced pistol booming faintly) (shotgun booming) (silenced pistol booming faintly) (silenced pistol booming faintly) (knocking on door) - (speaking in foreign language) gentlemen. Welcome, please come in. Please, right this way. - [Tadao] So that's all you've got? - Well all three of them work for an individual named Milan. Ex-Green Beret, first served in Vietnam, then he fell off the map for about 15 years. Now the rumor is that he was recruited by the CIA Covert Ops. - Where can we find this guy? - Everything is in that envelope. (speaking in foreign language) - [Sammy] I'll make some calls. (speaking in foreign language) - Let me stop you right there. (speaking in foreign language), but Dom, we gotta get this prick out. I got business in California, especially Southern California. - What are you talkin' about? You talkin' about a hit on another boss? You know what the ramifications are? - Fuck the ramifications. - Whoa, Ralphy, where do you get balls big enough talkin' like that? Look, your people were in his territory, you were askin' for it. My people aren't goin' to war over business that don't concern them. (speaking in foreign language) - Listen, Dom, you got interests in California. It's your people he's pushin' out. Now what has L.A. got right now? 20, 30 people tops? Right? I say we move on them. Push these old dagos out. - Dominic, everybody, we're businessmen here. As businessmen we have a right to a certain amount of privacy. But the minute a shot's fired, and it doesn't matter who fires it, the public, the press, the cops, they'll be on us like flies on shit. Like flies on shit. - And if we move in on Dippolito we're breaking protocol. Our own people find out we're breaking the rules then they'll turn against us. - Ralph, I know how you feel about the hit on Manzella. - Thank you. - But Nick's right, we gotta handle this thing right. This thing here's a very delicate matter. Dippolito ain't shit, but he's got all the New York people behind him. So we gotta be very careful not to step on the wrong toes here. We ain't afraid of the Five Families, but a war would be very bad for business. So we don't bother them, they don't bother us. - [Ralph] Okay, well, what are we gonna do about this bastard? - Just leave it to me. I'll figure this thing out. - [Ralph] Alright. - This is a picture of him. - How much? (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - Money's not the problem, just don't fail and you'll get paid. - When do you need it done? - As soon as possible. - You're partners with Russell Dippolito, aren't you? (speaking in foreign language) Why don't you go to him? You don't want him to know, right? (sinister music) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - Look, you don't have to lie to me. - I'm not lying to you. I've never lied to you. Please understand this is for your protection, not mine. It's dangerous for you. More danger than you even know. - Yeah, but I know your way of life and it doesn't scare me. I'm a big girl. (sinister music) - But you gotta trust me on this, you can't spend time with me now. We gotta get a time out. (engine rumbling) We always have to have it. - Let's go. (machine gun chattering) (tires squealing) (pistol booming) - Theresa, Theresa! I'll get 'em. (sirens wailing faintly) - Chief, can I show you something? - Yeah. - Okay, thank you. Now Dippolito was in a meeting with this guy, Vladimir Kryukov. Vladimir Kryukov, looks like a freaking eye chart, doesn't it? Good thing these guys don't have middle names. Anyway, the feds have their own investigations going on, and this morning, the polizei, the Republic of Georgia during the Soviet Era. And he has multiple indictments for murder and extortion back in Moscow. This guy here, Boris Bodrov, his right hand. Now the feds believe, don't quote me, but the feds believe that they're part of an offshoot of a Russian crime group based in Moscow. - Very impressive. - [Carol] Thank you. - You've done a lot of homework. - [Carol] Yes I did, thank you. - Where'd you get all the pictures? - Well, you know, I did some surveillance on Dippolito's club. - Off the books, I'm assuming. - Of course. Look it, this here, Kazuo Nagai. I got intel from the feds on him too. Now remember those three corpses we found in the Overland Hotel? - No. - You remember. Well, it turns out that every one of them had a record with the Osaka Metropolitan Police in Japan. They're all members of a criminal group called (speaking in foreign language). Nagai, guess what? Number three in the organization. - What are these guys all meeting about? - Was something about patching up a business deal because of some guy named Milan who whacked those guys in the hotel. - So, you were listening in? - Well, yeah, they were talking about merchandise. Obviously this was some dope deal gone real bad. - Wiretaps. - Don't you see what's going on here? Dippolito's forging an alliance with the Japanese and Eastern European mobs. The DA's gonna go ape shit over this. - The DA? - Yep. We gotta let Johnson know as soon as possible so he can open up another investigation into Dippolito's activities. - Yeah. I already talked to Johnson. - Yeah? - You know, you never got that wiretap approval from the judge. So here you are, wiretapping Dippolito's club? - What? - The wiretap approval you were trying to get that you never told me about. The judge never signed the order, hotshot. - Are you kidding me? - I asked you to lay off and move on. Now you've got yourself up the creek. I've gotta suspend you indefinitely. - Oh Chief, come on, this is bullshit. I know I broke your protocol and I'm sorry, but look we finally nailed that douchebag Dippolito! - Your badge and your gun, Driscoll. - I don't believe this. I don't believe this. That's my dart gun. (solemn music) - Why the hell did you go to Kwong? He's the last person you wanna get involved, here. Now he's opened a whole new can of worms. - We need to get those guys that killed our men. Russians can't deliver. And we're not waiting around. - Kwong's men missed Milan. They shot his girlfriend. - We are not leaving here until we get those fuckers. If you can't take care of it, we'll find someone else. - Listen Junior, this is my town. No one makes any moves without my okay. - Oscar Kwong seems to be doing things without your permission. - That fucking prick needs to go. It's only a matter of time before he crosses our path again. - No. A war is too costly. You talk to Kwong's and Kryukov's people. We're gonna have a sit down before things get outta hand. (uneasy music) - We're unarmed. We're stepping out. We're unarmed. This is no trick. Look, I just wanna talk. - You've got a lot of nerve comin' here alone. - I want to make an offer. - You don't think you're walkin' out of here alive, do you? - Look the woman's death had nothing to do with me. Those Japanese you killed, they work for someone called Nagai, and were friends with Mr. Dippolito. They were responsible. - And your people work for Dippolito. - No, not my people. I was against Kryukov's deals with the Italians from the beginning. - Who were the triggermen that came after my lady and me? Japanese? - No, Chinese. - Chinese? - Yes, Chinese. They worked for someone named Kwong, Oscar Kwong. I can deliver you him. - Sure you can. - If Dippolito is after you, no matter where you're going, as long as he's alive you're not safe. Let's go to my car, I have something to show you. - Yeah right. - You can see I am unarmed. You can kill me anytime. I don't have any weapon on me. Let's go. - Dara, watch him. If he makes a move, shoot him. - Be cool man. - You and I should work together. We have a common interest. I'll let you keep the drugs you stole from Kryukov and the money you stole from Japanese. - [Milan] You're gonna let me keep it? - [Boris] Let me show you something. (speaking in foreign language) - The fuck is this? - Give me your gun. - What? - I said give me your gun. - Give it to him, Jack, I got him covered. (pistol booming) - Tomorrow night Dippolito's holding a meeting with Oscar Kwong and his men. The Japanese will be there too. Also, men loyal to Kryukov. Everybody in one place. - Let me get this straight, you're gonna double cross them and you want us to do your dirty work. - And you take over everybody's operations in the city. - Yeah. - How convenient. - Why not? - Gimme one good reason why I shouldn't put a bullet in your eye. - Because without my eye, you'll never see the man who killed your woman. (uneasy music) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) - Welcome back. - Listen, whaddya have for me? You know what I'm talkin' about. - Well I have Barrettas, Glocks, Smith and Wessons. - I'd like to see that Barretta. - [Kenny] Barretta 97 Select-Fire 9mm. - Beauty. I'll take that one. - Oh, this is a MAC-11 9mm with a suppressor. Very high cyclic rate. - Let me see the Vector. - Oh, great weapon. Vector .45 Select-Fire, lot of knocking down power. - Now, whaddya have in the backroom? - That's reserved for my select clients and I think it's a little bit out of your price range. - Really? I think this will take care of it. - I think so, follow me. - Kenny, the one I want most of all is the big boy. - I like it. - You think you can handle that? - What are you, a comedian? (uneasy music) - When are you gonna get this Driscoll bitch off of my case? What the fuck do I pay you for? - Don't worry about it, Rusty, it's already taken care of. You guys are making a lot of noise around here. - And this Milan character? He's starting to be a thorn in my side too. I want you to put him outta commission. - Put him out of commission? (laughing) You stupid son of a bitch. You killed his girl. These special forces guys stick together. Do you know what his crew is capable of? - That had nothing to do with me. That was Oscar Kwong's people. We'll take care of him. - Kwong? Oh not another war, not in this town you don't. You're gonna put us all over the front pages. - Relax Chief. We're gonna have a sit down with Kwong and the Russians. - What about Milan? - We'll take care of him in our own way. Meanwhile I want you to provide security for my people at this sit down. Just in case Kwong decides to get cute. Now go on, take a hike. Nothing worse than a dirty cop. - Um, whaddya think this is, a fucking charity? - Pay the prick. - See ya. (upbeat music) - Shit. Darcy, you asshole. - Dippolito's coming with the bulk of his men. - Hey, what about the Chinese? - They will be here too. They don't trust each other. Nagai's men will be here as well. Just have your people ready. - What about Kryukov's loyalists? - Don't worry, I'll take care of them. - You better. (expectant music) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) - Finally crawled out of your shithole to pay me respects, Oscar? - Fuck you! - Do it to yourself. Raise your own little bastards, goddamn (speaking in foreign language). (silent machine gun chattering) - Nuh-uh, nuh-uh. That isn't a Q-tip, but it will clean out your ears. - [Darcy] What the? - I knew we had dirty dicks in the department. - [Russell] Where's Kryukov? - He couldn't make it today. He said to start without him. - Are you kidding me? He doesn't come to one of my meetings? What's going on here, Boris? (machine gun chattering) - [Darcy] Driscoll, you bitch, you have no idea what you're getting involved with. - Oh, I think I do, because you're gonna be Dippolito's baby momma in the slammer. - [Darcy] That's not gonna happen. - Oh, I think that Judge Patterson and District Attorney Johnson would disagree. - You moron, who do you think leaked Manzella's, Lamandri's, and ever other potential witness' whereabouts to Dippolito? - What are you talking about? - I'm not going to jail. Neither is Dippolito. Everybody who's anybody in this town is on his payroll. - [Carol] Mother fucker. - He didn't mean any disrespect. He is really ill. I'm here to represent him. - Your Jap friends still owe me money. - Alright, alright, we'll get around to that. But first thing we gotta talk about this guy Milan. He's been trying to find ways to get all-- (speaking in foreign language) (speaking in foreign language) (shouting in foreign language) Mr. Nagai! Mr. Nagai! Please, please, calm down. - We don't take orders from you, old man. - Everybody calm down. Now look, we have a common enemy here. Milan and his crew, they know that you accepted the contract that killed his girlfriend. (pistol booming) (silenced pistol booming faintly) (dramatic music) (shouting in foreign language) (shouting in foreign language) (machine gun chattering) (machine gun chattering) (man grunting) (machine guns chattering) (pistol booming) (machine gun chattering) (machine gun bolt clicking) (rifle booming) (man grunting) (machine gun chattering) (machine gun chattering) (machine gun clicking) (machine gun chattering) (thumping and grunting) (thumping and grunting) (machine gun chattering) (machine gun chattering) (thumping and grunting) (fist thumping) (bone cracking) (machine guns chattering) (pistol booming) (machine gun chattering) (machine guns chattering) (pistol booming) (machine guns chattering) (machine pistol chattering) (machine guns chattering) (machine guns chattering) (pistol booming) (machine guns chattering) (machine guns chattering) (silenced pistols booming faintly) (pistol booming) (machine guns booming) (machine guns booming) (machine guns booming) - Go eat some dog you fuck! (pistol booming) (machine gun booming) (pistol booming) (dart thudding) - [Carol] An eye for an eye. We got him, Baby. We got him. (machine guns chattering) (dramatic music) (pistol booming) (pistol booming) - Vengeance is ours, Theresa. (silenced pistol booming faintly) (guns firing) (machine gun chattering) - Fuck. (chuckling) (pistol booming) (machine guns chattering) (tires squealing) (machine guns chattering) (grunting) (pistol booming) (pistols booming) (gatling gun chattering) (machine gun booming) (screaming) (gatling gun chattering) (machine gun chattering) (gatling gun chattering) (machine guns chattering) - Milan, what can I say? I owe you one. Thanks. Because of that, I'm gonna give you a seven... No, I think I'm gonna give you a five minute head start before I shoot you in the back. Hey, tick tock tick tock. Come on, you guys are wasting your time. Get outta here! Go on, get outta here before I change my mind. Don't ever come back. (dramatic music) - Help me up, let's get outta here.
