? [wheel clanging] Aisle four. Well, hello there. What do you say? Hello. [register beeping] I got one. We don't need a cart, honey. I want one. We're only gonna get a couple things. Now Benny's gonna want to push too. OK, Benny, you push your brother. Ready, bud? Alright. Ready to go? Ah! [brakes squeal, thud] Davey! Davey! Oh, my God, Davey! [sobbing] Benny. What, are you stalking me? Oh, please. Standing outside my class for hours could be considered stalking. OK. Calm down. My class just let out too. You comin'? Ah. I don't think so. I have stuff to do. What could you possibly have to do that's more important that mudball? Mudball with the future scientists of America? Just about anything. Come on, we really need you. You're the only thing close to resembling an athlete on our team. I am an athlete. But I'm not on your team. Officially. Subs are allowed. No. Come on, look at me! Pwwwease? Big strong man, pwwwease? I don't have any sweats. Perfect! Thank you! You can wear John's; he left them in my dorm. Alright, let me text my mom. ? Hike! You are amazing. Literally, every time you're here we win a game. You have to join the team... Ooooh... You shut up. -Hey. What's up? -Hello. You kicked our asses. Nah, it's a team effort. Bullshit. You're the only one who knows what he's doing out here. I'm Christopher. Benny. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. You're a tough guy to bring down. I played in high school. Oh, I see. Yeah, I mean, the Engineering School here is not known for its scholar athletes. They call themselves the Killer Rabbits - that ought to tell you something. But it's fun. Well, we don't have an excuse. My team's just terrible. So, I've gotta take off now. I don't live on campus, gotta get home for dinner. OK, cool. Are you here on campus? Uh, yeah. Gallucci Hall? Cool, cool. Christopher. Yes. Can I get your number? Benny, is that you? Yes. I'm covered in mud. Don't track that in here. I know, Ma. I think I met someone today. What do you mean? A guy. Really? Yeah, really. I think. So...tell me. I don't want to say too much right now, Ma. Come on, you started it. -Ugh... -Who is it? I don't know yet. I met him at mudball. He was on the other team. We kicked their asses. So, you talked to him? I did. And...? I don't want to say too much right now. OK... -Cute? -Ugh. Oooh, Benny's got a boyfriend! Exactly what I didn't want to happen. No, Becca, he's not my boyfriend. So who is he? Do I know him? -How would you know him? -I know people. Oh, gosh. -Ma? - Yeah? Yeah, he's cute. [phone buzzes] I have a little sister - Becca. Freshman in high school. And my Mom and Dad. Cool. You close? Yeah, we get along. Um... My Dad's very cool, very mellow. My Mom is a bit of a hoverer. I told her about you... About me? What did you say? I told her that we met and that you seemed cool. What did she say about it? Nothing. I told her she couldn't say anything. Why not? I don't even know what to say about it. I mean, there's nothing to say about it yet, is there? What is your Mom like? She runs a yoga studio in Jacksonville. Yeah, so she's totally chill and in touch with herself. Which is cool. But she's also alone. She and my dad divorced when I was six when we were living here and then she and I moved down to Florida and she hasn't been with someone past two dates since. Do you do yoga? I can, but I don't. Uh, it's hard to breathe and relax when it's your mom telling you what to do. You know, sometimes I wish I lived on campus. I love my family and all, but there's not much freedom or space of my own, you know? There's not much space in my dorm either. My roommate... never leaves. So what's your major, exactly? Biomedical engineering. I eventually want to be a doctor. Design tissue. Wow. You? I'm in Arts and Sciences. My classmates seem to go by the rule that the less you know, the more you talk. And I like to talk, as you can tell. I like to talk to smart people. Like you, Dr. Benny. Well, thank you. I'd invite you up, but my roommate will be there. That's OK. I gotta go home. Study. I like you, Christopher. I like you too. I want to see you again. I want to see you again. Duh. Wow. Yeah. I've gotta wait here for a second. -Why? -Um... -Oh! -Hey, hey, hey, hey! -Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry! -No, it's OK. Trust me. Call me, Dr. Benny. I will. Those are pretty ones, Ma. I think so too. You want to come with me today? No, I think I'll stay. Bueno. Thank you, Becca. Uh huh. So Benny tells me he wants to go to a party on campus tomorrow. He wants to stay over. Good for him. Sounds like fun. He says he's staying over at Julie's. Well, that's fine, no? I mean, she's his friend. It's not like he's gonna get her pregnant. -David. -What? I think he might be lying to us. No. Really? Don't be like that. Baby, look, he technically shouldn't even be living with us and we certainly shouldn't be knowing what he's doing outside of the house. Think about it. Imagine if your mom knew what went on when you were in college. I just don't know if I want him staying over with this new boy. Why? What's wrong with this kid? I don't know. We haven't met him yet. I'm sure he's a good guy. Benny's a smart kid. You can't put his pinga on lockdown. -That's no fun. -Not funny. Let him go, 'cause he's gonna go anyway. And you'd let Becca do the same thing? Oh, hell no! She's not going on any sleepovers until after she's married. [chuckling] That's not fair. Fine, I'm kidding... Kind of. When did he get old enough to do things he's not old enough to do? [club music playing] Gentlemen! My lady! -Woo! -Yeah! Thank you! To friends, to us, to a great night! To the boogie! Yeah! ? - I'm so tired. -Oh, come on. These are for you. I'm staying the night at John's place and you two are spending the night at my place because my roommate's out tonight. -Really? -Of course! Happy honeymoon, honey. -You are the best! -Oh, my God! -Total perfection tonight -It kind of was. It still is. I love you, Benny. I love you too, Julie. Thank you. OK, John. Say goodnight to the boys. It's time to go night-night. -Nighty-night, guys. -Goodnight, John. See ya! I would love to. Oh, God. Do I even need to tell you which side is Julie's? God love her. Love her. I'm starting to like you more and more. ? Wait, wait. Let me help you. [giggling] ? I have to say, I imagined this happening, but not on flowery sheets. Morning. Good morning. What time is it? 10:20. I wish we could stay here all day. Be great. But, dude, your breath stinks. Are you ticklish? No. Stop! Stop! -Take it back? -I take it back. Your breath doesn't stink! -Take it back. -I take it back. How did everything go? It was fun. Yeah? The club was good? Yeah, it was great. It was really packed. And, um, what's his name, Christopher... Was he there? Yes. Yeah, he was there. Is this going to get serious? -Ma. -Just a question, Benny. I don't know... Maybe. ? [crowd noises] ? Ma, Dad, this is Christopher. -Hi. -Nice to meet you both. Nice to meet you, Christopher. It's nice to finally meet you, the day you're taking our son away from us. -Ma! -No. Just kidding, It's so nice of you to invite Benny down to Florida for spring break. Yeah, of course. I'd rather he stay in a nice home instead of one of those big party hotels. I'm no partier, guys. And my Mom will be there. Great. Wish I could come too. Maybe next time, Ma. Maybe next time. So, you know where you're going? Yeah. We've got it all mapped out. Christopher knows where we're going camping on the way. It's all good, Ma. OK. I worry, you know that. It's my job. I'll text you updates. -Not while you're driving. -Of course not. Benny, come with me for a minute? We'll be right back. -Ah, Dad. -Be smart. Come here. Come on, before she starts asking where we are. Oh, that's such a cute picture of Benny. Oh, actually that's not Benny. That's his older brother. His brother? Benny had an older brother. My first son, Davey. Oh, I had no idea. He never said. Davey was killed when he was eight. I'm so sorry. It's OK, it happened a long time ago. Alright, well spring break's not gonna wait for us. Really? You sure you want to go with this guy? -You don't even know him. -Lenora! No offense, Christopher, you seem like a really nice guy. But Benny is my Bennycito. My baby. Benny: Stop. You sure you boys don't want to stay here. It'd be fun. I'll cook all your meals. OK. You guys should get on the road. See you, Dad. Christopher... Great to meet you. You guys be safe. -Bye, guys. -Bye. And just like that... That woman was insane. She wasn't so bad. She was! Sorry it got so weird in there. See why am I'm so excited to be getting away? You good? Yeah... Yeah, I'm good. -Spring Break! -Woo hoo! Woo hoo! So you've never left Ohio? Never. How is that possible? You never went on vacation? I mean, we'd go camping here, boating here. I know, I know, lame. But the one time I was actually supposed to go to Washington DC on a school trip? Yeah, I ended up getting mono and had to stay home. Mono? Really? Who were you kissing? I wish. Nah, a couple guys on the football team got it from sharing water bottles. Likely story. I mean, I can sit here and make up a hot locker room story if you want, but really, it was the damn water bottles. Well, in honor of the maiden voyage of Dr. Benny... A video! No, I hate being recorded. Stop! But you're so cute. No. Not when I'm driving! OK, my turn. Say hello! Oh, my God. What is that? We're gonna do a lot of eating. We're gonna go to the beach for the first time. -First time for me. -First time for everything. Bbbrrrbb. Make a funny face. [crickets chirping, train whistle in distance] I love to travel. My Mom and I moved around for two years after we left Ohio. We lived in Georgia for a bit, in North Carolina. I've been to Texas. Arizona. After I finish college I just want to take off for a while and see the world. -Wouldn't that be amazing? -Yeah. You should come. We travel well together, I think. Yeah? Yeah, for a day so far. No, I wish. I have school for the next how-ever-many years. Ah, right. Dr. Benny. Yep, yep. Dr. Benny. Can I ask you something? Uh... Why didn't you ever tell me about your brother? I don't know. I didn't really think about it, I guess. Do you miss him? I don't really think about it. What was he like? What? What? What are you doing? Let's go in. The sign says no swimming after dark. It doesn't say no skinny-dipping. Come on. You call that skinny-dipping? THIS is skinny-dipping! Woo!!! [laughing] It's cold! I got it. Holy shit! A whole box? How much sex are you planning on having with me? My Dad gave it to me. -Your Dad? -Shut up. He must be expecting you to get a lot of action, huh? Mr. Cruz... If you don't stop you're not gonna get any for the whole trip. Ah. That's what I thought. Hey, Mom. Um... I just wanted to let you know that we're almost there and we'll be there in the afternoon. So I'll see you soon. Uh, listen, there's something I want to talk to you about... I'll talk to you when I see you - alone... Um... Sorry to be weird. I'll ll see you soon. OK, bye. ? Christopher! Oh! We thought you forgot about us; the house was all dark. Forget about you? How could I forget about you? I've been waiting for weeks. Benny... -Welcome! -Thanks, ma'am. Carol, please. You're grilling? Yes. Catfish. Look at this. Fruit. Green Salad. The works, for your grand return. You never grill. When did that happen? Well, I had to learn how to feed myself now, didn't I, after you left? Truth be told, this is Christopher's grill. -He was top chef around here. -Mom, you have to watch it. Oh! No worries, I can salvage it. See, it's perfect. Just don't look at it. Go on. Have a seat. Table's been set. That was very good, Carol. Thanks. Wasn't bad, was it? It was good. I guess you can teach an old dog new tricks. Hey, are you calling your mother a bitch? I stopped calling you a bitch when I left the house. Thank you. I think. I was never a bitch to you, was I? No, Mom. I think I was a pretty damn good mother. You were a good Mom. Are. [chuckles] And I always knew how to embarrass you, didn't I? OK, I'll stop. But word to the wise, Benny, he does turn a cute shade of red when he gets a little pissed off. I can't blush, I'm Mexican. I'm going to take this stuff up. This woman is dying to interview you. Be sweet. And mind your own business. God, I love that boy. Do you love that boy? Uh, he's great. Yes. He is great. And I am really pleased he's got a good friend in you and he brought you down. -I hope you feel at home here. -Oh, I do. Be it ever so humble... Akron, Ohio, huh? I'm sure Chris told you he was born there. Yeah? And I was born and raised there as well. Good people... Polite. I can tell you're a good guy, Benny. Not that there aren't good people down here in Florida. Just fewer. But the weather? Worth every rude asshole. Pardon my French. In Spanish it's pendejo. Pendejo? -Nice ring to it. -Yep. Come on, Benny, let's go see the room. No, no, no. You're cutting off my interview too soon! Go. Thank you very much for dinner, Carol. You think I'm gonna to let you two boys hog this whole tub on a beautiful night like tonight? Mom, please. Oh, come on, I need it for my old, aching bones. Benny and I are fine in here without you. Ooh. Is it hotter in here than usual? -It's OK, Christopher. -Really. Thank you, Benny. A gentleman. Making the move down here was the best decision I ever made, I'll tell you what. Couldn't drag me back to those winters in Ohio. So, Benny, let's really get acquainted. Tell me something about yourself that no one else knows. -You don't have to. - No, no, no. I will... If I can think of something. OK. Can it be silly? Silly is far better than tragic, my dear. OK... Well, back when I was in high school I had a crush on one of my football teammates. I mean, this was after I was already out as gay in school. It was hard to have a secret crush when you weren't out of the closet yet, but it was even harder when you were out because everyone was watching and waiting to see who Benny would be going after. And you know guys, I mean, most of them thought I was into them when I totally wasn't. I did, of course, develop a crush on this one guy. His name was Ron. Right tackle. Kind of dim, but sweet and cute. I had to act like I didn't even notice him and I would stay away from him but only because I would get nervous around him. So on Valentine's Day when everyone was handing out cards, I actually cut a card out of construction paper and slid it into the hall locker. It said, "I have a crush on you." I didn't sign it, of course. And, uh, it was the only card he got. He made a point to show it around the entire school... and speculate on which girl had given it to him. Ah, he was beaming for the rest of the day, which made me happy too, that I could even make him feel like that. Even a little bit. I never told anyone that before. That's not silly at all - it's sweet. You've got yourself a romantic, Christopher. Oh, you're insane. You never told your mother that story? You should tell that to her, she would love to know that about you. Benny and his mom are very close. Yeah. I'm lucky, my parents are great. What do they do? Uh, my Dad's a lawyer and my Mom's a stay-at-home with me and my sister. Yeah, the Cruz family is a perfect little Midwestern family, I guess. Mom. Cruz? Your last name is Cruz? Yeah. Mom, go. Is your mother Lenora Cruz? -Yeah. -Mom! Go inside! That was weird. She can be a little crazy sometimes. How did she know my Mom's name? I probably told her. I'm sure I did. You're smoking? Christopher, dear, I'm sorry, but I have to talk. -Mom-- -I have to talk to Benny. Can't you just leave us alone. Benny, I was in that parking lot that day - with your brother. -What-- -Benny, we can get out now. Christopher, I have to say this. Benny... We were shopping, Christopher was there with me, and I was driving... I was pulling out of the parking lot, as usual, and he just... I didn't even see him. Your brother... He was so small. I swear. He was... I didn't see him. It was an accident. I hope you know that. A horrible accident. It was the most terrible day of my life. You have to know that. I know it was an accident, Mrs. Gaines. You poor kid. I can't believe you're sitting right here in front of me. I think I'm gonna go in now. [door opening] Benny... I'm sorry. It's OK. No. No, it's not. I just... What the fuck? I just need a minute. I feel like I can't breathe. What can I do? Nothing, really. Just let me sit here. Just, just give me a minute. Why don't you just hop in the shower? I'm sorry. You shower first. I'll be fine. OK. [moaning] [phone dinging] -Just a second. -No, no, no, no... Hold up, it's Benny. It's Benny. Hey. Hey, Ma. Hi, sweety. Are you busy? No, no, no, not at all. You sound like you're working out or something. No, no, no. Well, yeah, I mean, I'm just in from a walk. How are you, sweety? How's Florida? It's great. Yeah? Good. I just wanted to call and let you know that... everything is going really, really well. You good? Yeah, I'm good. OK. Well, keep having fun. Thanks for calling, baby. Thanks, Ma. I love you. I love you too. The shower's free. Great. Thanks. I'm sorry for all of this. You're sorry? Are you kidding me? I'm sorry. I've just never heard another side to the story. And I think I just called and interrupted my parents having sex. Oh, shit. So talk to me. Please. Do you remember that day? Not really. I was, like, six. I remember Davey being there and being on the ground. And I remember my mother's screams. Mostly I remember what happened afterwards. The funeral. My father telling me what had happened... and telling me to be a good boy. And I remember my mother... my mother not treating me the same as she had before. For a while. And my Mom. It's crazy. [sighs] I just want to have a good spring break. Yes. We will. I'm gonna go shower. [sobbing] ? Feet together. Hands at your sides. Palms facing forward... And breathe. Right hand over your head, extend. Nice simple stretch. Open your chests. Open your hearts. And breathe. Good. I think you can extend a little more right here, Benny. I think I want to go home. That's where we're going. No... I mean Akron. We just got here. I mean, I hate that I want to, but I feel really uncomfortable. I don't know what to do. I can't stay. If we leave now my mom's gonna feel terrible. I know, but... I mean, I feel terrible. This was supposed to be awesome, you know... us down here. We'll leave this afternoon. Thanks. So, like I said, uh, Benny's got a lot of exams coming up and he's starting to get kinda stressed out about them. So, I think it's best we get him back. I understand. Thank you so much, though, Mrs. Welling. Carol. My pleasure. I hope you'll come down again soon. You're welcome here any time. Thanks. Bye. So I'm just gonna go and talk to her real quick. Yeah, sure. Uh, you know we're not leaving because of any exams. We're leaving because of you. What are you saying? You had to go and tell him, didn't you? Christopher. I told you over and over again to stop talking. -Sweetheart-- -And you wouldn't stop blabbing. I had to tell him. Why? You don't even know him! Who said you got to decide that? You just have to ruin everything. All the time! We were going to have a great Spring Break and, like, be a couple and all that other stuff, and you just had to go, like, ruin it. Just like you ruined it up with Dad. -The past just doesn't go away. -Aaahhh. You were going to have to deal with it sooner or later. I know that, Mom. But who said you got to decide that? I was happy. I was really happy. You wouldn't let me be happy. ? This sucks. I guess I'll go now. Benny-- Let me ask you a question. You knew, didn't you? You knew about Davey, and you brought me down there anyway. I didn't know until... the day we left. And then it was too late. You knew that your mother killed my brother and you let me walk into that house like nothing was the matter. I just wanted to have a good spring break, I guess. Why would you do that to me? I didn't know what to do. I'm sorry. I think I want to take a break from you. I don't want to hang out with you right now. Oh, Benny... No. Yes. I'm so sorry. Who leaves Spring Break early? Julie, don't. -Tell me. What happened? -Nothing. You're not with Christopher now? Did he do something? No, he's fine. It just doesn't look like we're a good match, so why bother. I think you guys are really great together. And I think you really like him. We're actually very different. And? Can we not talk about it, please? -What happened? -Julie, come on. OK, sorry. I can't be worried about you? Just worry in silence, please. I wanted to be around you so you could cheer me up. Oh, OK. Was the weather, like, terrible or something? I don't want to talk about it. Well, I know if I was ever at the beach for spring break, I'd never want to leave. -Wow! -Becca! Whatever. [knock on door] Benny, can I come in? Sure, Ma. What's up? We have to talk about this. Whatever it is that's eating at you. I hate to see you this way. What happened in Florida? Ma, nothing happened in Florida. You can't keep walking around carrying this inside. -It just didn't work out. - How? I have to study. No, Benny. You're gonna take a minute and you're gonna tell me. When you left you were so happy. What happened with Christopher? What did he do? He didn't do anything. Ma, it, it just wasn't working. Ma, trust me, you don't want to know. I do... You can tell me. Did he hurt you? Ma, no. Then what is it? Mama... Oh, baby... It's not Christopher. It's his mother. His mother's name... is Carol Welling. But before, when she was married... it was Carol Gaines... when she lived here. Ma... I didn't want to tell you, Ma. [breathing heavily] I can't... No, no, Ma. Mom, they moved to Jacksonville after... So you left? I had to. I, um, I think you've made the right decision. [breathing heavily] Babe, what is it? Lenora, ?que pasa? What's going on, babe? Benny... -Is he OK? -Benny told me... Christopher... Christopher... is Christopher Gaines. Christopher Gaines. Carol Gaines' son. How is that possible? Is that why he...? Now every time, I see Christopher, I'll... I can't. He stopped seeing him, right? Benny broke up with him? Is that wrong? No, no. Of course not. Well? Hey! Good morning. Hey. Oh, hi. Julie said you were in class until 4. Just like her. I was giving you this. I miss you, Benny. Christopher, why didn't you tell me? Why did you let me go to Florida? -I didn't know what to do. -You should have told me. You should have thought about how I would feel. I know. I thought everything was going to be OK. I thought if I told you you would leave me. -I didn't want to lose you. -You lost me anyway. Yes, I lost you anyway. I'm sorry. I miss us. I miss us too. I hate this. Is Benny here yet? He's coming. I'm sure he'll be here. Oh, there he is. Oh, God. Why did he bring him? I don't know, baby. But we're here for Becca, OK? We'll talk to him afterwards. Aunt Abby! Aunt Martha! Come in here. We'll be in in a minute, dear. No! Come in here now! Yes, dear, what is it? Where's Elaine? I thought you promised me you wouldn't let anybody in here while I was gone! Oh, well... Jonathan just walked in-- I don't mean Jonathan. Dr. Einstein was with him, but-- I don't mean Einstein either. Who is that in the window seat? Oh. We told you -- Mr. Hoskins. It is not Mr. Hoskins. Oh, well. Who can that be? So you're telling me you've never seen him before? I most certainly am. Well, this is a fine how do you do! It's getting so anybody thinks they can just walk into this house. [crowd cheering, applauding] Hey, Ma, Dad. Hello. Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Cruz. It's nice to see you both again. You as well. Becca was really, uh, really, great. She was, wasn't she? Oh, my God, she was hilarious. Don't you think, Ma? I'm very proud of her. Here's our little star now! Come here. You were terrific! I'm so proud of you! Thank you. I'm so glad you came. Oh, of course! You were awesome. And you too. Oh, yeah. It was my pleasure. I think you're definitely gonna be a star. Thank you. We're gonna meet you in the car. OK, babe? OK. We'll talk at home. Hey, Dad. Hey, kiddo, you got a minute? Yeah. Tonight didn't go well. I thought Becca was awesome. Take a seat. You really upset your mom and me tonight. I'm sorry you both feel that way. Maybe you should cool things with Christopher for a while. Why? Because we don't think he's the best match for you. You don't choose who you fall in love with, Dad. Yeah, actually, you do. That's what adults do. You don't just get to choose with your heart, you choose with your mind. And you don't just choose for yourself, you choose for those who love you. This is stupid. This is stupid. I have tried breaking up with him. I've stayed away from him and I have felt more and more miserable. Ben, I know it hurts. -It'll pass. -No, it won't! Benny, we love you. So much. We only want what's best for you. And we would hope that you want what's best for us. Look, you've had your fun with him. You, you know you love your mother. How do you know you love this Christopher? I know, Dad. I know. Benny. Why can't I get what I want? Why can't you be happy for me? Haven't I done everything right all of these years? When have I ever fucked up? -Benny, watch your mouth. -Or what? Or you'll see. Yes, Dad... We will see. Ben! [door closes] [knock on door] [knock on door] -Hey. -Hey. What's up? Can I stay here? Yeah, of course. You remember Tucker. Hey, Tucker. Probably won't even notice we're here. So what's up? What else? My parents. They don't want me to see you. Aahh... They don't want me to live my own life. [phone dings] You should probably answer that. Hmm. I don't feel like it. I'll make them worry a little bit. Let's make some room for you. Cool. It's mainly these... Damn. What? Some of us actually study in college. You ass! [giggling] Where's Benny? He didn't come home last night. I know that. Where is he? I don't know, Mija. Why don't you call him and ask him yourself? Damn. What do you want me to say? Nothing, I guess. [phone dings] Hey, Becca. What's up? Becca, everything's OK. I just can't be home right now. Becca, it's OK. Don't cry. This will all be over soon. I'll be home very soon, sis, I promise. But I have to go now. Everything will be OK. But promise me you won't cry anymore. OK? OK, cool. Bye, Becca. I love you too, sis. Benny... Benny... You know you can stay here as long as you want. You know that, right? But you can't keep avoiding your family. You have to make things right with them. -Are you kicking me out? -Of course not. Good. Because my Mom will never accept this. You don't know that. Oh, but I do. Your mom will never accept it as long as you keep avoiding her. -You have to talk to her. -Drop it. -Please, just talk to her. -I told you to drop it! You know, you want me to leave? Fine, I'll leave! I don't want to talk to my mother, and I don't want to talk to you anymore either! I just want everyone to leave me alone! [door slams] ? ? Hello. -I thought I heard somebody. -Hi. You come to raid the fridge? I was hungry. It's good to see you. Go ahead, make your sandwich. So, um, one final down... Calculus. I did really well, I think. Good. I'm glad. Yeah. I knew everything on it. I studied well, I guess. Yeah. You always have. You know, you know where I'm staying. With Christopher. Benny... He had nothing to do with it, Ma. I don't know what you want me to do. I honestly don't know what you want me to tell you. We've never talked about it before... Me and you. He's a cool guy. He doesn't remember it. I don't really remember it. Why does it matter? It happened a long time ago, Ma. A long time ago? It's still happening! It's still happening right now! It's just about to happen! That day is today. I don't know how more clearly I can say that to you. It's all been one long, awful day. I don't want you to feel like that. I don't want you to be sad. Christopher was there that day. I can see him, I can see you. And I can see Davey. It's too much, Benny. He's here in my life now. I'm here now! I can't make you understand. Well, I guess neither one of us is ever gonna understand each other. Benny! Benny! Stop! Benny! Benny, stop! Take your sandwich. I don't want anything from you! Benny. Sorry. You really freaked me out. Are you OK? Yeah. Look who's here. Hi, Benny. I know you didn't expect to see me. But Christopher's been telling me what's been happening - you staying here and all. I want to try to make things right. I told her not to come. I couldn't not come. And then you disappeared last night? She wants to meet your mother. Oh, God... I think it's important that we talk. You can't just fix everything all the time. You're not some, like, spiritual guru. I have to see her. I don't really think she'd want to talk to you. We can handle this. I told you not to come. You guys deserve a chance. And I feel responsible. It's not fair to the two of you. Benny, I'd like two things from you. I'd like the address of your house... and I'd like the address of your... your brother's resting place. ? [sobbing] Hello. Hello. Lenora... Pardon me for coming here, but I had to. What-- I thought about it and thought about it and I... I had to come. You have no right-- Please. Just give me a moment. I visited the grave before I came here. I saw the vase of flowers. I need you to know how sorry I've been... So incredibly sorry. There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about that day. And the only way I've been able to get by all this time is to remember. To tell myself it was an accident - a tragic accident. Then I met Benny, your son, and he's wonderful. And I don't know why, but he and my son are friends and I can see they really share something special. Have you seen it? Forgive me. Please forgive me. Benny is special. And Christopher seems like a very nice young man. But you need to go. I will, If you want me to. But I just wanted you to know how truly sorry I've been. And now you've have done that. Yes. Thank you, Lenora. I didn't come all the way up here for me. And it wasn't for you. It was for our boys. Hey, baby, who was that? Christopher's mother. What did she want? She came to ask for my forgiveness. Really? Are you OK? I'm fine. What did you say to her? I don't know... I asked her to leave. She's lucky I stood there and listened to her talk. Baby, do you remember what you said to me when we first lost Davey? Do you remember? I didn't think I could take it anymore. The sadness, distance from you. Missing Davey. I wanted to leave, and you said, "Try harder." You knew I was stronger than I thought I was. Baby, I need you to try harder. I don't want to. You have to. I am there for you. You have to. Benny loves Christopher. Even if it's just for now... we have to deal with now. I know it sounds crazy, but... I don't even see our little boy in there anymore. He's not. He's grown up, babe. If I lose Benny... it's like I'm losing Davey all over again. That's just the way I feel. I need you to try harder. [phone dings] Hello, Ma. Hi, Benny. What's up? Benny, come home. I don't think so, Ma. We want you to come home. We miss you. It's not family without you. I don't know. We'd like you to bring Christopher for dinner. Uh, hold on. She wants you to come over for dinner. Tell her yeah. OK. Great... Great. That makes me really happy. So, can you make it home by seven? OK. Good... See you at seven then. Benny, I love you. OK. That's good. Well, dinner at seven, I guess. -Hi, guys. -Hey, Ma. Hey, guys. Thanks for coming. Of course. I hope you guys brought your college appetites, because we have a big meal for you. Oh, yeah. There's lots of food here. Thank you, Mrs. Cruz. You are welcome, Christopher. Have a seat. You can sit here, Christopher. -Next to you, Becca? -Maybe. Mmmm... Thank you, Becca, I'd love to sit next to you. ? Alright, come on. Let's get to dinner. I'm hungry. ? ?
