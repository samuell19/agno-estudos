Subtitles by explosiveskull Ladies and gentleman, please welcome... So I walk into the Capitol Theatre, and I start hearing about all the history in this place, and you know that history is in the walls, so it's in the plaster. It is one of those rock clubs that becomes one of the members of the band, if you will. It becomes a part of the ether. I love knowing the history of a place and walking out onstage and saying, okay, all you spirits that have been in this room, be here. ♪ I hitched a ride with a vending machine repairman ♪ ♪ He said he'd been down this road more than twice ♪ ♪ He was high on intellectualism ♪ ♪ I've never been there but the brochure looks nice ♪ ♪ Jump in, let's go ♪ ♪ Lay back, enjoy the show ♪ ♪ Everybody gets high, everybody gets low ♪ ♪ These are the days when anything goes ♪ ♪ Everyday is a winding road ♪ ♪ I get a little bit closer ♪ ♪ Everyday is a faded sign ♪ ♪ I get a little bit closer to feeling fine ♪ I see you! ♪ He's got a daughter he calls Easter ♪ ♪ She was born on a Tuesday night ♪ ♪ I'm just wondering why I feel so all alone ♪ ♪ Why I'm a stranger in my own life ♪ ♪ Jump in, let's go ♪ ♪ Lay back, enjoy the show ♪ ♪ Everybody gets high, everybody gets low ♪ ♪ These are the days when anything goes ♪ ♪ Everyday is a winding road ♪ ♪ I get a little bit closer ♪ ♪ Everyday is a faded sign, eh ♪ ♪ I get a little bit closer ♪ ♪ Everyday is a winding road ♪ ♪ I get a little bit closer ♪ ♪ Everyday is a faded sign ♪ ♪ I get a little bit closer to feeling fine ♪ One, two, three! ♪ I've been living in a sea of anarchy ♪ ♪ I've been living on coffee and nicotine ♪ ♪ I've been wondering if all the things I've seen ♪ ♪ Were ever real, were ever really happening ♪ ♪ Were ever really happening ♪ ♪ Everyday is a winding road ♪ ♪ I get a little bit closer ♪ ♪ Everyday is a faded sign, yeah ♪ ♪ I get a little bit closer ♪ ♪ Everyday is a winding road ♪ ♪ I get a little bit closer ♪ ♪ Everyday is a faded sign ♪ ♪ I get a little bit closer, feeling fine ♪ ♪ Everyday is a winding road ♪ ♪ Everyday is a winding road ♪ ♪ To feeling fine ♪ ♪ Everyday is a winding road ♪ ♪ Everyday is a winding road ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, oh, I'm feeling right ♪ ♪ I'm feeling right, I'm feeling right ♪ How do you feel tonight, everybody?

As a kid, I figured that everybody's parents were playing music and coming home with their friends and playing albums on the Magnavox and dancing and jamming along. I don't think I ever thought of me in this tiny town going all over the world and being like a famous rock 'n' roll star. I went to college, I got my degree in classical piano, and I got my teaching degree. I taught school for a couple years, and then I started doing some recording session work, recording my own songs, and then I was off and going. One, two, three, four!

I can't believe I've been touring now for 20, uh, hm... 20-something years, and I've never played this room. It's amazing. We feel very honored to be on this stage where Jerry Garcia and Eric Clapton and Bob Dylan, and just the hallways and the dressing rooms are full of pictures of people who have graced this stage, so we're just gonna try to absorb some of their juju that they left behind, maybe let a little of it just rub off on us and hopefully bring you guys some joy and some love tonight. This is a new song that's really just about owning who you are and being proud of that. And, man, that's something we gotta really embrace these days, so this is called Be Myself.

I did not actually pick up a guitar until after my first record was made. I think I was about 29. Moved out to LA, I took my demos to every studio in town. I overheard some people talking about the Michael Jackson audition, to be a backup singer, and I found out where the audition was and I went and said, "Hi Michael, my name is Sheryl Crow. "I just moved here from St. Louis. "I was a schoolteacher and I would "love to go on the road with you. "I'm a singer." And I wound up getting it. I wound up singing on the Michael Jackson tour. But, really, I didn't think of myself as like stand out in front and play the guitar and really rock the band until after that tour. And then I realized I'm into this. I wanna pursue fronting my own band. If you go all the way back to, well, the first song that we played, Everyday Is a Winding Road, that was sort of from the standpoint of somebody who was younger looking behind, but this song is from somebody a little more seasoned. And it's the road ahead that I'm looking at. This is called Long Way Back Home. ♪ I got an up-close glimpse of the outside world ♪ ♪ It's an awful big place, well, that's for damn sure ♪ ♪ I've seen more of this life than most have seen ♪ ♪ And it's taken a mighty big toll on me ♪ ♪ It sure feels good to be free ♪ ♪ Some days I feel all right ♪ ♪ Some days I can't wait until it's night ♪ ♪ Sometimes you gotta face the light ♪ ♪ Get back in the ring, put on your gloves and fight ♪ ♪ I think it's gonna take some time ♪ ♪ To find a way to ease my mind ♪ ♪ I'm gonna take the long way back home ♪ ♪ I'm gonna take the long way back home ♪ ♪ Back home ♪ ♪ Did you ever see a man have a heart attack ♪ ♪ It'll open your eyes and stop you in your tracks ♪ ♪ Well, I threw away my last cigarette ♪ ♪ I'll get it right this time, I'll clean up my act ♪ ♪ Well, that's a hard cold fact ♪ ♪ Some days I feel all right ♪ ♪ Some days I can't wait until it's night ♪ ♪ Sometimes you gotta face the light ♪ ♪ Get back in the ring, put on your gloves and fight ♪ ♪ I think it's gonna take some time ♪ ♪ To find a way to ease my mind ♪ ♪ I'm gonna take the long way back home ♪ ♪ I'm gonna take the long way back home ♪ ♪ Oh, back home ♪ ♪ So many things I ain't done yet ♪ ♪ So many things I've done that I forget ♪ ♪ I just need a place to rest my head ♪ ♪ Some days I feel all right ♪ ♪ Some days I can't wait until it's night ♪ ♪ Sometimes you gotta face the light ♪ ♪ Get back in the ring, put on your gloves and fight ♪ ♪ I think it's gonna take some time ♪ ♪ To find a way to ease my mind ♪ ♪ I'm gonna take the long way back home, oh ♪ ♪ Some days I feel all right ♪ ♪ Some days I can't wait until it's night ♪ ♪ Sometimes you gotta face the light ♪ ♪ Get back in the ring, put on your gloves and fight ♪ ♪ I think it's gonna take some time ♪ ♪ To find a way to ease my mind ♪ ♪ I'm gonna take the long way back home ♪ ♪ I'm gonna take the long way back home ♪ ♪ I'm gonna take the long way back home ♪ ♪ I'm gonna take the long way back home ♪ ♪ Oh, back home ♪ I signed with A&M Records, and we made a record that was very, it was very slick. I mean, it sounded a lot like maybe a Sting record, fantastic musicianship. When I handed it in, I just was like this isn't what I wanna do. I wanna rock. Luckily, A&M heard me and they said, "Look, we'll give you another shot." I kicked around for a while. I wound up with a group of friends who were recording out at Bill Luttrell Studio. I went out to a jam session and that was really what kicked the whole vibe off, and that is how I wound up making the Tuesday Night Music Club record. 'Cause it didn't sound like anything else that was on the radio, and I just didn't think that it would do anything. ♪ She was born in November 1963 ♪ ♪ The day Aldous Huxley died ♪ ♪ And her mama believed every man should be free ♪ ♪ But her mama got high, high, high ♪ ♪ And her daddy marched on Birmingham ♪ ♪ Singing mighty protest songs ♪ ♪ And he pictured all the places he knew that she belonged ♪ ♪ He failed and taught her young ♪ ♪ The only thing she'd need to know ♪ ♪ To carry on ♪ ♪ He taught her how to run, baby ♪ ♪ Run, baby, run, baby, run, baby, run ♪ ♪ Run, baby, run, baby ♪ ♪ Run, baby, run, baby, run ♪ ♪ Past the arms of the familiar ♪ ♪ And their old, familiar ways ♪ ♪ To the comfort of the strangers ♪ ♪ Slipping out before they say so long ♪ ♪ Baby loves to run, ooh ♪ ♪ She counts out all her money ♪ ♪ In the taxi on the way to meet her plane ♪ ♪ She stares hopeful out the window ♪ ♪ At the workers fighting through the pouring rain ♪ ♪ And she's searching through the stations ♪ ♪ For an unfamiliar song ♪ ♪ And she pictures all the places ♪ ♪ She knows she still belongs ♪ ♪ She smiles her secret smile ♪ ♪ But sure she knows exactly how to carry on ♪ ♪ Ooh, run, baby, run, baby ♪ ♪ Run, baby, run, baby, run ♪ ♪ Oh, run, baby, run, baby ♪ ♪ Run, baby, run, baby, run ♪ ♪ Past the arms of the familiar ♪ ♪ And their old, familiar ways ♪ ♪ To the comfort of the strangers ♪ ♪ Slipping out before they say so long ♪ ♪ Ooh, baby loves to run ♪ ♪ And she's searching through the stations ♪ ♪ For an unfamiliar song ♪ ♪ She pictures all the places she knows she still belongs ♪ ♪ She smiles her secret smile that shows ♪ ♪ She knows exactly how ♪ ♪ To carry on, oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Run, baby, run, baby, run, baby, run, baby, run ♪ ♪ Run, baby, run, baby ♪ ♪ Run, baby, run, baby, run ♪ ♪ Oh, run, run, run ♪ ♪ Oh, run, baby, run, baby ♪ ♪ Run, baby, run, baby, run ♪ ♪ Oh, past the arms of the familiar ♪ ♪ And their old, familiar ways ♪ ♪ To the comfort of the strangers ♪ ♪ Slipping out before they say so long ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ Ooh, baby, sure enough loves to run ♪ ♪ Ooh, yeah ♪ ♪ Baby sure enough loves to run ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ An oldie but oldie. ♪ Took your car, I drove to Texas ♪ ♪ Sorry, honey, I suspected we were through ♪ ♪ I can't cry anymore ♪ ♪ Since I left, I've been feelin' better ♪ ♪ That's what you get when you stay together too long ♪ ♪ I can't cry anymore ♪ ♪ Wouldn't it be good if we could hop a flight to anywhere ♪ ♪ So long to this life ♪ ♪ So much for pretending ♪ ♪ Bad luck's never ending ♪ ♪ And now I know that money comes in ♪ ♪ But the fact is there's not enough to pay my taxes ♪ ♪ And I, I can't cry anymore ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ I got a brother, he's got real problems ♪ ♪ Heroin, there's just no stopping him tonight ♪ ♪ And I won't cry anymore ♪ ♪ Wouldn't it be good if we could hop a flight to anywhere ♪ ♪ So long to this life ♪ ♪ So much for pretending ♪ ♪ Bad luck's never ending ♪ ♪ It's never real, yeah ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Could be worse, I could've missed my calling ♪ ♪ Sometimes it hurts but when you read the writing ♪ ♪ On the wall, you won't cry anymore ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, wouldn't it be good if we could ♪ ♪ Hop a flight to anywhere, so long to this life ♪ ♪ So much for pretending ♪ ♪ Bad luck's never ending ♪ ♪ To the time I miss being here ♪ ♪ With my head in my hands ♪ ♪ Is it a good time to come and meet her ♪ ♪ Well ♪ ♪ Well ♪ ♪ Well ♪ ♪ Well ♪ ♪ Well ♪ ♪ Well ♪ ♪ Well ♪ ♪ Well ♪ ♪ Y'all make me want, well ♪ ♪ I can't cry anymore ♪ ♪ Can't cry no more ♪ ♪ I can't cry no more ♪ ♪ And you ain't gonna see me mope around my house ♪ ♪ No, no, no, no, no, no ♪ Audley Freed.

David Bowie, I knew. With David, I didn't know that he was sick, just like everyone else, and that was a real, that was a real blow but also a lesson in grace, you know? He had so much grace about the way he conducted his personal life. With Prince, no one saw that coming. Having seen him from days when I was on the Jackson tour doing club dates and having played with him, having gone to Paisley Park and recorded with him, it just really hurt. But the Tom thing... That was really close to home. He was, for me, somebody I kind of wanted to emulate. I loved the span of his career. I loved his integrity. I loved that he was still doing it, and that what he was doing was Tom Petty music. He was doing rock 'n' roll, and he wasn't changing every two records, and I just, I really admired him. All right, so I don't know about you guys, but I'm really pfft sick of how gnarly and ugly and just everybody being so ugly to each other since Trump's been elected.

We made a record last year that came out in I think maybe, oh, hell, I don't know. Maybe April or something, I don't know. It came out in one of the months of the year. And a lot of it was written sort of during last year's political campaign and, gosh darn, I just saw America just becoming a country I didn't recognize. I just had so many questions, and especially raising two small boys and thinking about the future and what it's gonna look like. A lot of it, I just barfed out onto the record. It talks about hacking in Russia, and it was sort of a song that was like what would be my worst nightmare, and then it happened. So, we're gonna play it for you. ♪ Leonard put on his sunglasses and he dialed the telephone ♪ ♪ He left a message with his loved ones ♪ ♪ Don't wait up, I won't be home ♪ ♪ And he scribbled on some hotel stationery ♪ ♪ Now you see me, now you don't ♪ ♪ Put the money in a briefcase, and he gave it to the man ♪ ♪ Who took it to the Cayman Islands ♪ ♪ And he buried it in the sand ♪ ♪ So when the hackers hacked the system ♪ ♪ He'll be on the beach with a Mai Tai in his hand ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Oh, but that's all right ♪ ♪ Yeah, that's okay ♪ ♪ When it gets too tight, gonna slip away ♪ ♪ You've got the money, you've got the fame ♪ ♪ When you see me comin', you'll know my name ♪ ♪ Hide in the shadows 'til your dying day ♪ ♪ Revelation's a heartbeat away ♪ ♪ Well, the devil's in the details ♪ ♪ As the details start to leak ♪ ♪ Is it was as was predicted, you can feel it on the street ♪ ♪ There ain't no silver in the bank vaults ♪ ♪ There's just paper where the money used to be ♪ ♪ Even God ain't gonna fix this ♪ ♪ We got here all on your own ♪ ♪ You bet the President is sweating ♪ ♪ While Russia's blowing up the phone ♪ ♪ Deny, deny everything but still ♪ ♪ Let's give that rabid dog a bone, right ♪ ♪ Oh, but thats all right ♪ ♪ Yeah, that's okay ♪ ♪ When it gets too tight, gonna slip away ♪ ♪ Yeah, you've got the money ♪ ♪ You've got the fame ♪ ♪ When you see me comin', you'll know my name ♪ ♪ Hide in the shadows until your dying day ♪ ♪ Revelation's a heartbeat away, yeah ♪ ♪ Heartbeat away, heartbeat away ♪ ♪ Heartbeat away ♪ ♪ Heartbeat away, heartbeat away ♪ ♪ Revelation's a heartbeat away ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Well, it's gonna be a new day ♪ ♪ Said the man with the red face ♪ ♪ With his finger on a button as he hums Amazing Grace ♪ ♪ And he ponders the eternal on his private jet ♪ ♪ As he heads off into space, yeah ♪ ♪ Uh, you've got the money ♪ ♪ You've got the fame ♪ ♪ When you see me comin', you'll know my name, yeah ♪ ♪ Hide in the shadows until your dying day ♪ ♪ Revelation's a heartbeat away, yeah ♪ ♪ You've got the money, you've got the fame ♪ ♪ When you see me comin', you'll know my name ♪ ♪ Hide in the shadows 'til your dying day ♪ ♪ Revelation's a heartbeat away ♪ ♪ Heartbeat away, heartbeat away ♪ ♪ Heartbeat away ♪ ♪ Heartbeat away, heartbeat away ♪ ♪ Revelation's a heartbeat away ♪ ♪ Heartbeat away ♪ Thank you! I really just wanted to go into the studio and feel like my second record and my third record, where it was just like close the door, stir up the stew, see what you can make, and to have that feeling and that energetic excitement about making music. It's the result of my real concern about who we are with all these gadgets, these avenues to disconnect ourselves that are in the name of connecting ourselves. And yet it's just a really uptempo, fun album. It's very inspired. It's inspired by everything that was going on during that time and leading up to that time. Hey, I've got an idea. Let's all, tomorrow, throw our cellphones away. Could you do it? Yeah! I think our humanity just depends on it. And this is what I suggest. When you throw your cellphone away, you go rollerskating. ♪ I like the sunshine ♪ ♪ Bouncing off your mirror shades ♪ ♪ Well, I love that you love loving me ♪ ♪ Can't you see I need a little more of your embrace ♪ ♪ But you start to panic, you can't stand still ♪ ♪ Getting a message, talk about a buzzkill ♪ ♪ I, I, I, I want some attention ♪ ♪ I want to put you center stage ♪ ♪ I, I, I don't want competition ♪ ♪ So put your phone away, let's rollerskate ♪ ♪ Got your picture ♪ ♪ Swimming 'round inside my head ♪ ♪ While all the kids flicking pics ♪ ♪ So they can click on what they missed ♪ ♪ I kinda like real life instead ♪ ♪ Juiced up a little of that human touch ♪ ♪ Old school contact, would it be asking too much ♪ ♪ I, I, I, I want some attention ♪ ♪ I want to put you center stage ♪ ♪ I, I, I don't want competition ♪ ♪ I want a little face to face ♪ ♪ I, I, I, I ain't in no hurry ♪ ♪ But, baby, I don't like to wait ♪ ♪ I, I, I don't want competition ♪ ♪ So put your phone away, let's rollerskate ♪ ♪ Ah, roller-skaters ♪ ♪ Come on, let's go ♪ ♪ I, I, I, I want some attention ♪ ♪ I want to put you center stage ♪ ♪ I, I, I don't want competition ♪ ♪ I want a little face to face ♪ ♪ I, I, I, I ain't in no hurry ♪ ♪ But, baby, I don't like to wait ♪ ♪ I, I, I, I want to be your distraction ♪ ♪ So put your phone away, let's rollerskate ♪ Thank you, that's Josh Grange on pedal steel, everybody.

We love you! We love the Capitol Theatre! Thank you, guys, God bless you. Be good to each other. It was crazy, we'd played all over the New York area and had not played the Capitol Theatre, and so you walk the halls in there and you know that Dylan was there rehearsing and you know that The Grateful Dead did many shows there. And you know there must have been alcohol and pot and chicks and cool guys with their shirts open, and there must have been all kinds of things going on. I feel like, as an artist, you don't have the luxury of closing off and not experiencing all that. You cheat yourself. This was a really amazing place to not only play but to film and to capture your music with this legacy going on in the ether. Thank you so much! You guys have been so great, and we've just had so much fun. I feel like an extremely blessed woman just to be able to still be playing music and to still have a career and also to be up here with such amazing musicians and such great incredible people. So, for me, every night is just, you know, it's a blessing, so we're glad you're here.
