law and order broke down. Organized crime rose in its place- not that it wasn't there before. But after that, it became open season, everyone looking for a fistful of Euros, myself included. When one mob family has a problem with another, they call me. For the right price, I solve it. I'm a fixer. That's what I do. But that's not the only reason I'm here. Hey, man. It's been a while, Demyan. What's up, brother? - Liev, good to see you. I'm fine. - Vlad is waiting for you upstairs. - Hello? - Yes, Nicholi. Yes. We're ready on our end. Everything is in place and ready for the shipment. Perfect. We'll be ready to deliver it within the next 43 hours. What can I say, Vlad? It's been a pleasure. I'll call you after it's arrived. Welcome back, my friend. It's good to be back, Vlad. You were away too goddamn long, you know that? I had to drink alone. I am sure this was no problem for you. - Eh? - Let's drink together. - Come on. Thank you, Nadia. So, tell me about Grozny. This deal, it went well. Because they're looking after our interest. I figured as much, but I meant tell me about the city. I have heard they almost rebuilt it now brick for brick. It's still Grozny. Remember Sergei? He shot that bitch just for scuffing his boot. He was a crazy bastard. So many of our brothers died in Chechnya. To Sergei. To Sergei. You know, someone should go back there and knock it down again for old times' sake. Vlad, the war is long over, hmm? Not in here it isn't. Not for me. - Vlad? - I'm busy. It's Mikhail Suverov. Mikhail, good to hear from you. We drew lines in the sand, you and I. You've wiped them clean. What are you talking about? You're doing business with Nicholi Dvorak without my green light. Bullshit. Who the hell told you this? Someone who knew. Look, I don't know who this man is, but whoever it is, he's lying to you. He's trying to turn us against each other. The problem I have with that is that his is not the only mouth I've heard this from. You know how it goes- you hear things so many times, there's maybe probably some truth to it. It's not what you think. Nicholi, he came to us. Of course he did, my friend. You're trying to take my business from beneath me. You're undercutting me by five points. You killed three years of peace between us for a handful of silver, Vlad. And I have just killed you. No, wait-- Vlad? Demyan? Talk to me. We are pinned down. He's got a gunman with .50 cal across the street, shooting through a window. When you find him, you murder the son of a bitch. Across the street. Go, go. Ah! - Come on! - Ah! - Come on! - No, no! Shit. Is he done? Get rid of that. What are you waiting for? Get rid of it. And make sure he disappears. We don't want any combat. Hey, you, stop! I said stop! Turn the fuck around. I said turn around! There are those who say it's a blessing to know who you are, what you've been destined to do in life. But to me it's more like a curse. How did I end up here? A series of random events, fate. It's hard to tell anymore. But here I am. The money's good, but you still pay a price. Isaiah 43:13-- "Forget the former things; do not dwell in the past." If there's one thing in life I know that's true, it's that the past is the devil. You can't run from it. It's always behind you. - Hey. - Ciao. - Good morning. - Good morning, Janice. Yes, it arrives tomorrow. Me as well, my friend. I'll call you with an update as soon as I know more. Speak then. Bobby. - How'd it go? - Good. He's chomping at the bit to get the cargo. - Hmm. Has it left Damascus yet? - No. It only left Astrakhan an hour ago. It should be there about three and a half hours. And the turnaround? It should hit Colombia by late tomorrow evening. Say two hours for offload, reload, refuel, and then another 23 hours back again. We should be good to go by the end of the week. Is good. Go and get the car. Da? I am calling to negotiate terms. Who the fuck is this? Mikhail, my father always told me, never ask a question you already know the answer. You waste my fucking time. You thought I was dead, didn't you? Demyan. Look, Mikhail, I hold the reins now. And fortunately for both you and I, we are at the reset point. So I figure it's best we negotiate terms swiftly while there's still blood in the water. Da. I'm listening. You crawl into Vlad's grave and bury yourself alive, or I will find you and I'll kill you and I'll bury you myself. Those are my terms. What now? We hit them harder than they hit us. I am going to unleash hell. Go. We need to think this through. We need to be smart. I'm going to destroy him. Yeah, but we go to war with Demyan and we can't go through Leo. His cleaner screwing up and not eliminating Demyan as well as Vlad is the reason we have the problem in the first place. But he's the only independent in town. So what do you suggest? Did you ever hear of the Wolf? He's a fairy tale. Tsk-tsk-tsk. The stories I hear, they're no fairy tale. Ari Perovsky has his number. Shut it. - What? - Is this the man they call the Wolf? I prefer Aleksey, but yes, they're one and the same. Can you be in Prague by tomorrow? That's a bit short notice there, mate. We'll double your rate. Okay, text me an address. And until then, fuck off. Sorry about that. Now about that money you be owin' Slim Jimmy... So, they sent a dog to collect their scraps. Actually they sent a wolf. Go! Can you pay? Ahhh! - Will you pay? - Yes! Ahh! - When? - Ah! Stop, God damn it! It's in the other room. Ah! Okay, okay! It's in the vault behind the bar! Ah-hh! One for the client... and the rest for me. Good dog. I've been watching her for a long time now. We're like two trains on the same track headed for a collision course. I've been reluctant to deal with it. But sooner or later, if I don't, it will deal with me. The time is near. Is that you, Leo? Usual place, tomorrow, half past 3:00. Hey, listen, it's my-- Excuse me. Well, hello, Ray. One unaccounted for. Yeah, so I was told. Hey, man, Mikhail is the one who asked to make a show of it. If you didn't agree to the terms, you shouldn't have accepted the job, Ray. Fair enough. He shouldn't have pulled a woman in front of him. She was a whore. We work on results, Ray, not excuses. You know that. I will finish with Demyan. I can promise you that. You're a day late and a dollar short for that, my friend. They've already hired in another shooter for the job. So where does that leave me? I strongly doubt that Mr. Mikhail Suverov will be requiring my services anytime soon due to this little fiasco. They're angry, Ray. And who can blame them? There's a million like Suverov, just like him. Why do you think I rang? Another gig in my own back yard doesn't exactly sit well with me, Leo. Besides, this looks like we're biting the hand that feeds us. Not if the hand isn't feeding you anymore, it isn't. Demyan wants to retaliate. And he's willing to pay a lot more than the Suverovs. And hitting both brothers, well... he'll pay extra for that. Hey, Ray? We started a war here. Wars are good for business.

I prefer it, in fact. Appleton Estate, 30-year-old rum from Jamaica, sir. I think it would be perfect in here, sir. I'm digging the sales pitch there, boyo. I'll give it a go. So, my friend, how do we begin? Introductions would be nice. Mikhail Suverov. Bobby Suverov. Aleksey. As for my unfortunate moniker, I'd rather you not use it. It's so goddamn cliché. Yeah, whatever. Aleksey, tell me, what do you know about the current state of play here in the Golden City? Same old, same old, I'd assume. Two parties of different opinions gnawing at each other's throats over trivialities. - I like the way you think. - I don't... think, that is. I simply do. What exactly is it that you do? I play chess with the old Boromets in the park every Tuesday, Thursday afternoon. I restore cars from the '70s, pinball machines from the '90s, and if you pay me enough, I'll probably kill anything that breathes. Probably? As in no innocent party, mate. Kids are off the table regardless, but I have no problem with women. Although I only shoot them. Using your hands or a blade on a lady just comes across as rather weak and rather tacky, you know? That's fair enough. So what is it that you want me to do? Wreak havoc. This is Demyan lvanov, his underboss Grigori Rikoniev, and his number two. And Nicholi Dvorak, local Czech scum. Nicholi is the one that started this, so he's up first. Hello, Nicholi. Who are you? A trained monkey. But well enough paid to do the little touch. What are you doing, Ray? Seriously, it's time to go. I haven't finished my drink. Just finish the one you've got and pay. Ha. Bring me another drink now. Sorry, we're closed. You've had enough. Go. Oh, yeah, bitch? Then I'm taking this with me. - You're not taking anything- - Get your fucking- - Ah! - Let go of him. Okay, okay, I'll go. It's okay. Let go, please. It's okay. Um... - Everything okay, Janice? - Yeah, it's fine. It's okay. - I'm sorry about that. - No, no, no, no. No use crying over spilt milk. Huh. You're American. Yeah. - Give me a sec, okay? - No, that's okay. No, I'll take care of this. It'll just be a second. Club soda and salt, works every time. First they killed Vlad, and then Demyan becomes boss. But is he happy about his accidental promotion? No. The bastard appreciates nothing. Hey, they served together in Chechnya. Vlad took a bullet for Demyan. - They were brothers in blood. - So what? Does that make me less of a man because I didn't kill bitches with them in Grozny? I mean, what about me? First I'm the underboss's underboss, and then the boss dies and what does that make me? I'm still a fucking underboss. Life is shit. You always see the glass half empty when you drink, Grigori. Oh, by the way, my glass is empty, Liev. Tell me, if I always get to refill your fucking drinks, then what does that make me? An underboss. Two at table two, one at table three, four at table six, three at table eight. Two clips, 17 rounds apiece, makes 34. 10 men, three rounds apiece, four slated to miss. Oi! Which one of you poor fools is Grigori? Who the fuck are you? So the left's only three in the clip, and the right... one in the chamber. It was a thing of beauty, no? You know that shit that killed Elvis, right? This shit here definitely would. Well, if it killed Elvis, it could kill me and maybe I don't want to do it. Baby, relax. It's just an expression. Come on. Well, it doesn't sound good. You should think of a different expression. Just fucking do it. Shut up. I told you, right? Baby? What really did kill Elvis? That? Pills, something. I don't know. Fuck. - You. - Out. You-- you worked for us. Not anymore. Look, whatever it is they're paying you, Mikhail will double it. Okay? He'll triple it. No, wait. I mean... I'm his only brother. He should have had another. It's Bobby! It's Bobby! - What do you mean? What do you mean? - There's someone out there! He's got a gun! No! Yeah? What the fuck is going on, Andrei? What's happened to my goddamn update? Yeah, Leo-- Leo's man took care of Bobby last night. And Mikhail? From what I understand, he walked in only seconds after the job was done. Hmm. This is fucking beautiful. Yeah, I hear it's really fucked Mikhail up. Of course it did. This was his brother. He's been looking out for this kid his whole life. Maybe this time he should try looking out a little harder. I, uh... I got bits of bad news. What exactly is bad news, Andrei? They hit Nicholi Dvorak. What? The police found him floating in the pool, 9mm to the head. It's not the end of the world. We'll find somebody else to do the business with. Andrei, is this it? This is the bad news? Nicholi isn't the only one who got hit. What are you talking about? Who else? Somebody hit the booking house. Killed everybody- killed all the boys. Grigori? Grigori, Liev-- everybody there dead. What about my money? I'm not sure. What the fuck do you mean you're not sure?! L-- I just got bits and pieces. The cops were crawling out of the place. - I couldn't stay for long, but-- - But nothing! - Find my goddamn money, Andrei! - Yes, boss. I understand, yes. Just give me some time to make some calls. Give me 20 minutes and I'll call you right back. You've only got 10. - Hey- - Hey- There you are. You left your jacket. Oh, right. How'd you find me? Oh. I found this in your pocket. Address. Nice. It's clean, by the way. Oh. How much do I owe you? No, no, no. I did it myself. It's good. Lucky for me, the right address was in the envelope, because it didn't have your name. - I'm Ray. - Oh. - Just Ray? - Ray Carver. I'm Janice. Look, I'm sorry for just stopping by. I just wanted to say thank you. You know, you took off so fast, I-- No, I'm glad you did. I-- I guess I owe you one. Oh, yeah? Okay. Well, in that case, um... Mmm. Fair enough. Well, hopefully I'll-- I'll talk to you soon. Hopefully. Bye. Shit. Did you lock yourself out? Nope, I'm good. See ya. Okay. So... am I still on the payroll? Hmm. What would you have me do? If it were my way, I would have you raze this city to the ground and salt every inch of it. But I made a promise to my brother to be smart, to think things through. Come with me. Mikhail. Leo. Hey, Aleksey. I heard you were in town. He's very expensive, but he's worth it. You two have met? Let's just say that we both run in similar circles. Why am I here, Mikhail? Your boy, whoever he is, he didn't finish the job with Demyan, but he sure hit a home run when he killed my brother. Now exactly which boy are we talking about? Bobby's girl saw the black bastard. Come on, Leo, be honest. How many monkeys are there in this city? Playing both sides is a very dangerous game, my friend. I want to know his name and I want to know where he sleeps. Come on, Mikhail, you're taking a piss. What sort of handler would I be if I kept tossing out the names of my assets, eh? You disrespect me. You are lucky to be alive! You accepted the contract for my brother. That makes you directly involved in his death. You should be counting your fucking blessings that I am asking you. My black bastard isn't mine anymore. Not since he cost me my livelihood with you. Come on, Mikhail! You're my best client. Do I look that stupid? If you're lying to me, I'll cut your fucking head off. I don't doubt you, Mikhail. I've known you for a long time. You tell me everything you know about this boy. I will tell you one thing- if you go looking for him, he'll find you first. I promise you. That's not him. This is longer than 10 minutes. I'm sorry. I had to reach out to a friend of mine at the department. It wasn't easy. And? The cops took the money. They have it in evidence downtown. I did find out, though, that there was a survivor at the betting room, one of the bookies. He saw the whole thing. According to him, this huge guy came right to the front door, called out Grigori, whipped out two 9mms and started blazing. One guy? This is bullshit, Andrei. What the bookie said he looked like is even crazier. What do you mean? Seven-foot tall, wearing a tacky Hawaiian shirt with a white fedora. He said he looked like a Frank Sinatra on steroids. The Wolf. What? Mikhail- he hired an out-of-towner. He hired the Wolf. But the Wolf is just a bullshit ghost story. No. No, he's as real as it gets. He must have been the same one who took out Vlad as well. What are we going to do? What the fuck do you think we're going to do? We're going to go Wolf hunting. Everyone bleeds, Andrei. Put the word out-- I will pay top dollar to find this guy, okay? - Okay, I understand. - Good. Meet me tomorrow at the betting room at 5:00. Don't be late, and fuckin' bring me something. - Something good. - Okay. Leo, this is my third message. What the hell is going on? How'd they know I was going to be there? Call me back! Wow. Not bad. Can I get you a drink? No, I'm good. Thanks. Look, it's just your accent, you being from the States and all... Mmm. I guess you remind me of home. Mmm, ah. You miss it? Yeah. But I had to leave. Why? Too many bad memories. And now sometimes I think I'm just in this city to hide, you know? Too scared to go back. Right. Scared of what? My dad was murdered. The guy that did it-- they never found him. He had this mask on. I saw him, though. I saw the whole thing. I was just a little girl, but, hmm, I'll never forget. I'm sorry. I mean, that's tough. I don't know why I'm telling you this. I'm sorry. I have to get this. Leg? I'm sorry, mate, but I did you wrong. What's up? Things are going to get pretty tough for us, Ray. What are you telling me, Leo? I'm gonna get out of Dodge. You gotta get out too. Get outta Prague. Mikhail clamped the vise. And I gave you up-- your name, where you're gonna be, where you live. All of it. I'm sorry, mate. If I didn't, I was history. Sorry. Hey. This belonged to my dad. He took it everywhere. Why is it here? Tell me! There's pictures of me in here. This is my life. What-- why? Did you have something to do with his death? Huh? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me! Yes. Why? Because it was what I was hired to do. And now you're here to kill me? No. I'm trying to protect you. Am I supposed to believe that, really? Catch you at a bad time? I threw you out the window. I bounce real good. And the grenades? I thought it was a nice touch. Just who the hell do you think you are? The bad guy. That's funny. I thought I was. We just got back from the black guy's place. Is it over? Is he dead? No, I don't think so. What happened? The place was a mess. But no bodies. We thought this might be interesting to you. The same girl-- she's in every picture. And Aleksey? I called him. He told me to tell you goodbye. Shit. Guess what? Thrill me. We got an anonymous tip about Mikhail's new man. You're right- it is the Wolf. He's staying at some high-end hotel downtown. We end this. We end this now. Hi, this is Janice. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks. Hey, Janice, it's me again. Can you please call me back? It's just I, uh... Just call me back. - You ready? - Shit.

Lovely girl, Ray. Hey, you should have told me about her before. We are actually getting rat-assed together. Can you get out? No, no, no, no can do. She's a bit tied up at the moment, taking someone's order. The place is absolutely jumping, Ray. I'm on my way. Hey, we'll tie one off before we get out of this dump for good, shall we? Right. Did I overdo it? Depends on whether or not he shows. He'll show, trust me. You won't be disappointed. You've never looked better, Leo. It's the one-armed push-ups, Ray. Where is she?

Let's go. I wish I had something to give you. Maybe you still can. Thank you, Ray. Jeremiah 3:20-- "The summer has passed, the harvest has ended, and we are not saved."

Why didn't I kill you? Nobody paid me to kill you. But the next logical question is... what the fuck are you doing in my house? I never really enjoyed being manipulated by those underworld assholes, so then I thought to myself- "Aleksey, there are a lot of assholes out there with lots of money. Instead of earning it from them... why don't we just take it from them?" Why not? Maybe I'll give you a call sometime. That, my friend, you may.
