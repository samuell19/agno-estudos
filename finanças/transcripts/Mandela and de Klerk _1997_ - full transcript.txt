Even parents. Even princes. >> You had to do chores? >> Of course. When I was a little boy-- just about your age-- my mother sent me to the home of my uncle, who was the king. My father had just died, and his brother the king followed the custom of our people and took me in. Once, in the house of the king, I had to go through rigorous training to one day become an adviser to my uncle, and later to my cousin, who would one day himself become king. >> You must've felt like the luckiest boy in the whole wide world. >> Yes. Going to school, being taught the ways of the court, yes. But my other duty was a big job for a little person. I had to iron the pants of my uncle for each state visit and ceremonial occasion. Those pants had to be perfectly ironed and pressed each time. If they were not, I had to go over and over and over them until they were right. >> But you were the prince. Couldn't you get the servant to do that for you? >> No. Because ironing my uncle's pants was my duty, and I stuck to it. That is what one does when one is given a responsibility and a trust. Ironing those pants taught me to be patient. And it taught me to focus myself on a single task. So, what do you think about that? >> Well... I think I understand. >> Good. Dear minister coetsee, there can be no doubt in your mind that the situation in our country has become untenable. ( People shouting ) Strikes, agitation in the streets, and armed resistance have not abated despite your best efforts. The black people of our country are harboring a great grievance. As an executive member of the a.N.C., and as a patriot who loves his country, I implore the government to sit down with members of our movement and face-to-face discuss ways in which we can bring an end to the terrible torment and suffering in South Africa. >> Just give this back to coetsee. So, tell me--do you think mandela grows desperate? >> I think mandela... Grows, Mr. President. >> Hmm! And I say mandela grows old. He senses god beckoning. He's running out of time, and that suits US very well indeed. >> Mr. Mandela. It's a pleasure. Johann kykendal, aide to the president. Step inside. >> The point is, Mr. Kykendal, the time has come for negotiations. What is it that is stopping your government from sitting down and talking to US? >> But surely, Mr. Mandela, that is what we are doing, isn't it? >> You are a civil servant, Mr. Kykendal, no more. And I am not authorized to negotiate for the a.N.C. Your government must go to Lusaka, or they will have to invite Lusaka here. >> P.w. Botha going to Lusaka? Speaking to tambo? ( Laughs ) That's impossible... And you know it. >> I do not think you appreciate the dynamics of this meeting, Mr. Kykendal. I am an executive member of the a.N.C., and you are a conduit. It is not your place to tell me what is possible or not possible. >> Mr. Mandela, i-- >> you... Will understand clearly three things and communicate them to your masters. >> I don't think you appreciate where i'm-- >> one-- I am not the head of the a.N.C., nor am I, in the current instance, its emissary. I do what I do knowing full well the risks I run of being repudiated. Two--we can only continue this dialogue if your government demonstrates its willingness to take a few risks of its own. The road to peace is precipitous, and if we are to travel it together, we must all share the risks involved. Three--i believe that this is your government's last chance for a peaceful settlement before...the armed struggle reaches a point of no return. Ignore it, and I believe our country will be laid waste in a war of attrition from which no Victor will emerge. >> Mr. Mandela, I can assure you that-- >> tell them. >> Madiba. >> Madiba. >> Comrades, I wanted you to know that my isolation has afforded me a certain clarity. >> I'm glad that you derived some benefit from it, because we haven't. >> Certain developments have taken place that I must report to you. >> From your isolation cell? >> I wasn't always isolated. >> I knew it. >> Who did you see? Botha? >> Coetsee. >> Coetsee. >> And a number of others. >> You have not informed tambo and the central committee? >> You've gone too far, Nelson. These meetings of yours with this government have compromised the a.N.C. >> It was an opportunity, and I grasped it. >> Yes, but whose opportunity-- yours or the regime's? Nelson, do you know what they could do with this? Every meeting you've held, every contact could be turned to their own benefit. >> Imagine the headlines-- "mandela in talks with government." It would be a propaganda coup, and at the very most, it would split US down the middle. >> I am not a child, Andrew. These thoughts have obviously occurred to me. >> Ah, madiba, you're treading on dangerous ground here. >> Since when has the a.N.C. Flinched from danger? I speak with the regime to enhance the aims of our organization. >> Yeah, but in secret-- that's the problem, madiba. >> Shh, shh. ( Prisoners chanting, whistle blowing ) >> I risk my reputation on my strong belief that the regime speaks from a position of weakness. We have got them on the ropes. Now, do we fight for another decade? Do we spill the blood of thousands more of our children to achieve what can easily be accomplished across a table? I'll be letting tambo know what I have done, and I will seek his endorsement. But until then, I want you to know that I intend to continue on this path.

Who drove the Cubans back in Angola? My army did. Who fought the communists in Mozambique? I did. And what recognition does the west give me? They nag, they whinge, they send me diplomatic communiques. "Negotiate," they say. And who must I negotiate with? A bunch of blacks running amok in the townships? A bunch of terrorists sitting in jail where they belong? Look at this. France, Germany, Japan-- they're all against me. I'm telling you, gentlemen-- if it wasn't for Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, South Africa would have no friends in the world at all. >> Mr. President, if it is a bold stroke the world wants, then you may be holding the solution to your problems in your hands. >> It is my intention to release Nelson Mandela from prison...If he will promise unconditionally to reject violence as a political instrument. ( Reporters clamoring ) It is therefore not the South African government which stands in the way of mandela's release. It is Mr. Mandela himself. >> Mr. Mandela, we are offering to set you free. You can go home and be with your family. >> UN-ban the a.N.C. Begin direct negotiations with our leader Oliver tambo immediately. >> Renounce the violence and you can go home. That is what we can offer you. >> Your president must see our point of view. >> He doesn't have to do anything. He is the president, and you have got his final offer. >> In that case, advise president botha that he will have my answer soon. >> De klerk: You see what he's doing? Mandela is making US wait. By the way, thank you for keeping me informed. >> He'll agree to terms, I think. He's a logical man. >> Look what he's done-- he's stolen the spotlight from the government. It's pointing directly at him now, and the whole world is waiting for his answer. That's not bad for a prisoner who's been cut off from the world for 22 years.

A boy was killed in the house. 14 years old, they say. >> Winnie-- was she there? >> We don't know. >> I think you should arrange for her to come see me, discuss the matter. Winnie... Were you there? >> No. I was not. I told you. >> Did you know what these young men of yours were doing to the boy? >> They are not my young men. They are my bodyguards. >> Did you know what they were doing to-- >> no. I do not want to discuss this! It has nothing to do with me. I gave that boy refuge in my house, that is all. Please, let's just leave it. >> I insist that you face it. >> I knew nothing. Why are you cross-examining me like this? I am innocent. I did not lay a hand on that boy. >> I believe you, winnie. >> I trust people too much. That has always been my problem. >> No. Your problem is that you trust the wrong people. You have to ask yourself-- what did you do to let this evil into your house? This can be a political embarrassment, winnie. But first and foremost, it is a tragedy. A young boy was murdered. >> I know nothing about it. >> Winnie, listen. I have started a process the end of which cannot be predicted. I cannot say what tactics the regime will employ against me. I have to be constantly vigilant. This business about the boy, this tragedy, tugs at my mind, drags me away from where my mind should be. Do you understand? Do you? >> I am not like you, Nelson-- all analysis and discipline and will. I smash into things. I yell, I scream, I cry. I make mistakes. Stompie was a mistake. >> That is not good enough, winnie. This was not merely a mistake. A boy died in your house. >> I know. >> These bodyguards of yours-- what do they call themselves-- the mandela football club? Get rid of them. >> Yes, of course. Yes. >> Try not to make any more mistakes. Our enemies seize on them and turn them against US. >> Please, let's not fight over it. I just have these few moments with you. Let's not spend them fighting. Please. >> Newscaster: In what could be the country's biggest ever legal strike, the union has called on 200,000 men... >> Second newscaster: 36 black railwaymen came out of the South African state railway's company, dismissed as 16,000 of their colleagues who refused to return to work after six weeks of their national strike. >> Third newscaster: Other major unions are talking of strike in support if history repeats itself. >> All: A.N.C.! A.N.C.! A.N.C.! >> Everybody here? >> Yes. ( Indistinct chatter ) >> Mr. President, I'm speaking to you not only as chairman of the party and a member of the cabinet, but as a friend and as an admirer. We have all learned a great deal from you, sir. You are a strong, proud warrior, a defender of the traditions that have made our nation great, and-- >> yes, yes, yes. Sit, gentlemen. That's all very fine, but you know and I know that you did not come all the way out here at 8:30 in the morning to flatter me. If you have something to say, then say it. >> Sir...you've had two strokes within the past year. You've resigned your chairmanship of the national party, where Mr. De klerk has replaced you. >> Not my choice. But go on. >> With respect, sir, we think you should consider playing a more--how shall I put it? >> You want me to resign? >> ( Sighs ) We think you should appoint an acting president, take a rest for a while. >> If you want me to resign, then say so. >> Well, at least until after the elections, sir, by which time you-- >> enough! So...This is how you all feel, is it? Answer me. Who agrees with him? So... Well, let me tell you what I think of you. You are cowards. >> This isn't an argument, Mr. President. We are here to tell you that it's time to stand down. >> No! You stand down! And you! You! I should fire all of you. I have the right. I'm still president, you hypocrites. >> Mr. President, the country needs new leadership. The failure of the mandela talks, the failure to resolve the violence in the townships-- >> all I need is time! >> And now there's evidence of scandal and corruption. Mr. President... There is an election coming up. You asked me to be frank. Well, then, sir... You have become a liability to our party. >> You go too far. >> Will you resign? >> Yes! Yes! I will resign. And tonight, I will go on television and announce to the world what a pack of liars and traitors you all are. I'm finished with with the lot of you. Liars, all of you! Liars! >> Congratulations, Mr. President. >> Good work. >> Thank you. >> Hear, hear, Mr. President. >> Well done, sir. >> Good evening. >> Good evening, Mr. President. May I introduce Mr. Nelson Mandela? >> Mr. Mandela. Good to meet you. >> ( Speaks afrikaans ) >> I'd heard that you spoke fluent afrikaans, Mr. Mandela. >> I haven't had much practice for a while. >> Please. Thank you, minister coetsee. I've read some of your writings-- a speech from the '50s, your statement prior to your imprisonment in 1964. Please. You are a most eloquent and passionate man, Mr. Mandela. >> Thank you. Let US hope that our discourse is marked more by eloquence than passion. >> Please, sit down. You understand-- I make no promises. >> As long as our conversations take US forward. >> Well, then, a good sign of progress would be an end to the armed struggle on your side, a commitment to peace. >> For now, my willingness to talk is precisely the commitment to peace you seek. >> Let me put it this way-- I want your guarantee-- >> excuse me, Mr. President. I can offer you no guarantee of any kind. I'd have to speak with my colleagues first. >> Well, how can that work? Most of your people are officially banned and living in exile. >> Of course. But if that is an inconvenience, you can always UN-ban the a.N.C. And let our leaders come home so they can give you their assurances in person. >> That's impossible. At this time. >> At this time. >> I'm a realist, Mr. Mandela. Once my government commits itself to negotiations, both you and I know what the outcome must be. >> Free and Democratic elections for all the people. >> Mm-hmm. I am under no delusions. But I will not countenance power-grabbing. Power-sharing, yes. But not the blind abandonment of all power. >> Majority rule is not power-grabbing. >> No whites would be comfortable in a country dominated by blacks. >> For more than 300 years, you have been dominated by blacks. You've simply never acknowledged the fact. >> We must have some say in the future. >> If you are talking about anything less than one person, one vote, it is a non-negotiable item. >> The rest of Africa is full of the relics of democracies that gave one man one vote... Once. Mr. Mandela... Everything is negotiable. >> I'm sorry, sir. But what you are proposing is nothing less than a transparent attempt to maintain white control. >> You're being unduly cynical, Mr. Mandela. >> That is a matter of opinion, Mr. President. >> Well...we will have to change it, then. You and I are both going to have to be willing to make some compromises. If we want to set ground rules, we need to begin negotiations. >> Mr. President, I don't mean to flatter you when I say that I sense an integrity here that has not distinguished many of your predecessors. So, yes... I agree. >> Good. Then let's begin. I've crossed the point of no return, kobie. I've embarked on my own perestroika. >> Yeah. The trick now is not to suffer the same fate as gorbachev. >> Do you know that mandela was once a boxer? >> Yeah. >> He'll know that you've got to roll with the punches. He'll expect me to give ground, but he can't expect me to commit suicide. I will not go down in history as the man who destroyed his own people. >> So, marike, you and Frederik used to all the pomp and ceremony here? >> There's not as much of that around as with Mr. Botha. But it's been quite a year, thank you very much. >> I'm very proud of you, Frederik. >> Thank you, thank you. >> And when I think how I used to nag you. >> Don't stop nagging me now. I've come to rely on it. ( Laughter ) >> What about all the unrest, Frederik, hmm? Are you going to maintain-- >> all part of the job. It's going to be all right. >> The people expect so much of him. You're only one man, Frederik. >> Do you remember what the reverend bingle said at my inauguration? "He who stands in the council chamber of god should be strong in his willingness to pursue the right course and push forward new reforms." >> It was quite a sermon. >> Yes, but from the pulpit, the world is a simple place. Frederik, you can't change the world overnight. I don't care what anyone says. >> It seems to me that there is a just road to be taken. I don't know, some people will hate me for what I'm going to do, but I have to move forward, and I have to believe that my vision of the future isn't simply an accident. ( Overlapping chatter ) >> Yes, yes. Listen to me. Listen! Listen! The time has come for our nation to take a new course, to bridge the gap between political fantasy and practical reality. As a result, today and henceforth, the policy of social engineering known as apartheid will cease to exist. ( Overlapping chatter ) All political prisoners will have their cases reviewed, and the minister of justice will determine which prisoners will be freed. ( Singing ) ( Cheering ) >> Madiba. ( Speaking native language ) ( Both laughing ) >> Madiba. >> Gabi. >> ( Speaking native language ) ( Laughter ) >> Good, good, good, good. >> Madiba. >> Raymond. >> See you. >> Nervous? >> It's been such a long time, Nelson. Freedom--i always knew it would come, but... >> I'll be joining you soon. >> Until then? >> Agitate. Old lion. Agitate. >> ( Sighs ) ( Engine starts ) >> ( Man speaking afrikaans ) ( People chanting ) >> De klerk: Marike, I need you to understand what i'm trying to do. >> South Africa was given to US by god, Frederik. It's our homeland. And what you are doing frightens me. >> It is frightening, I know that. Don't you think I feel that as well? I have to push forward. If we don't share this country, we afrikaaners will lose it. >> It's not the sharing that frightens me. It's the anger of terre'blanche and his people. You've read the reports. This could lead to civil war, Frederik--white against white, brother against brother. >> There is only one possible country for both the blacks and the whites of South Africa, and that is the future. The future is where we live from now on, and we have to accustom ourselves to that thought, or prepare ourselves for a war without an end. >> We've fought before. We fought the English. >> And we lost. We have to learn from our history. The past no longer works, the present isn't any better. Have faith in me, marike. I am trying to save our country. I won't give our fathers' legacies away. Marike. >> Reporter: Mr. President, there are suggestions, sir, that elements of the intelligence community and the army are directly involved in fomenting violence among the blacks. >> That is a vicious rumor without any basis in reality. ( Reporters shouting at once ) I'll tell you unequivocally there are no secret government agencies connected in any way with any of these incidents. You have my word on that. ( Men shouting in native language ) >> Mandela: How do you expect me to take these talks seriously when people in your government have armed the inkatha freedom party in kwazulu-natal? >> That is absolute nonsense. To what purpose? >> To neutralize the a.N.C.-- what else? By intimidation and assassination, your people have given inkatha carte blanche to create havoc. >> Chief buthelezi has the overwhelming support of the majority of people in his province. He doesn't need me to whip up support for him. >> Then how do they have so many guns? >> How does the a.N.C.? >> Certainly not supplied by your government. >> Damn you, Mr. Mandela. You give a person so little room to maneuver. >> I have had very little room to maneuver myself for two decades. One learns to adapt. >> Those are hardly the words one expects from a retired revolutionary. >> Mr. President, if you expect me to go out to pasture upon my release-- whenever that is-- you are greatly mistaken. If I find conditions are the same as they were the day I was arrested, I will go back to doing precisely those things for which I was imprisoned. >> Now, that helps no one. >> Then UN-ban the a.N.C. And all other political parties on your banning list. Release the political prisoners and allow the exiles to return. >> Mr. Mandela, I will take everything that you have said under advisement. >> I know. No promises. >> De klerk: I have ordered that the prohibition of the African national congress, the pan-African congress, the South African communist party and 33 other organizations, be lifted with immediate effect. ( Overlapping chatter ) As to the position of Nelson Mandela, I will make an announcement within the next few days concerning the date of his release. ( Overlapping chatter ) It is very important to me that discussions with the a.N.C. Begin at once. Our troubles have caused US enough pain and suffering. The time for negotiation has arrived. ( Overlapping shouts ) I can't very well carry on important negotiations like these with an inmate, can I? >> Release me? But-- I mean, when? >> Tomorrow. >> Mr. President, tomorrow is much too soon. Please, delay my release. >> I beg your pardon? >> I don't want to appear ungrateful, Mr. President, but I must insist that you delay any plans for my release. >> You're joking, of course. >> I need seven days so my family can prepare for my release. There will be chaos out there if I simply walk out. >> Damn it, man, I'm freeing you! >> I've waited 27 years. Certainly I can wait seven more days. >> A government plane will take you back to Johannesburg, where you'll be officially released. Please sit down, Mr. Mandela. >> Mr. President... I will walk out of the gates of Victor verster prison in seven days. And on that date, I will personally thank all those who have looked after me. And I will greet the people of Cape Town. >> Look here, Mr. Mandela. We have already set your itinerary-- >> Mr. President... Cape Town has been my home for nearly 30 years. There are people in Cape Town I must-- >> but we have a schedule. >> Yes, Johannesburg. Well, I will make my own way back there when I choose, not when the government wants me to. Once I am free, I will look after myself. >> Mr. Mandela, we can't change plans now. I've already told the press. >> How dare you speak to the press without consulting me? >> I'm the president, not you! >> I will be released when I say so... And not a day sooner! >> Uh, Mr. President? Maybe we... >> All right, then. I will agree to Victor verster if you will agree to release tomorrow. >> I can accept that. >> Mr. Mandela, must you fight me on every issue? >> Must you, Mr. President? >> Hurry up, everybody. We are running late. >> Okay, the press will be waiting at the gate for you. Sabc-TV has asked that you leave the car 100 feet from the gate and walk through the gate. >> Is that what they call a photo opportunity? >> You are learning fast. >> ( Sighs ) I've known no other great men in my life, Mr. Mandela, but... You know what I want to say. >> Thank you for your many kindnesses through the years. I know we will meet again. ♪♪ >> Newscaster: We can see the caravan almost approaching the gates now. Yes. Yes, the crowd is beginning to push forward. They've waited many hours for this moment, and the world has waited many years. Nelson Mandela will walk through these gates of Victor verster prison to freedom. >> My god, so many people. >> They love you, Nelson. >> I never realized. ( Cheering ) >> Newscaster: He's walking towards the car--the car that will probably take him to Cape Town. Mr. Mandela, leaving-- finally leaving the Victor verster prison-- his home for the last 40 months. >> Second newscaster: And in Cape Town, huge crowds-- waiting in the exhausting summer sun all day for Mr. Mandela's first words to the world at a rally-- were growing restless. >> All: A.N.C.! A.N.C.! A.N.C.! ( Chanting continues ) >> "I will not give our fathers' legacies away." Oh, Frederik...Where are the crowds for you now-- the man who opened up this brave new era, the man who freed mandela? >> A remarkable scene today at jan smuts international airport as Oliver tambo, head of the formerly outlawed African national congress, returned to South Africa after nearly 30 years in exile. Among those gathered to meet him were close colleagues Nelson Mandela, Walter sisulu, Joe slovo of the South African communist party, and Chris hani. Speculation is that talks will now move swiftly head on a negotiated settlement between the government and the leaders of black political organizations. But, for most of the people around the world, two men will hold center stage-- president f.W. De klerk and Nelson Mandela. >> Good beginning. >> But only a beginning. ( Reporters shouting at once ) >> More than 500 blacks have died so far, and more blood was shed this morning in a township near Johannesburg. The violence started after a rally addressed by the inkatha leader, chief buthelezi. >> Second newscaster: The casualty rate is climbing faster than ever. 100 killed today, over 500 in the past ten days. ( Shouting ) >> Mandela: Lies. Lies. We would not kill our own people. >> There were no whites present. It was blacks killing blacks. The evidence is clear. >> No, not clear. Obscured. >> The investigation clearly shows that the a.N.C. Was behind it. >> You sent the fox to investigate the chickens. >> For god's sake, Mr. Mandela, what would we possibly gain from massacring innocent people? >> You have much to gain. The more fear you sow amongst the people, the more votes you might gain in the elections. >> The election? We don't even have a date for any election. >> Elections are coming, Mr. President, as we both know. And either you, or members of your security establishment, are manipulating events. >> Manipulating events? Why? >> To affect the outcome of those elections. >> This is complete nonsense, Mr. Mandela. >> All right. Appoint an independent commission to investigate the massacre at boipatong. I will abide by their findings. >> And if I don't? >> You will leave US no choice but to resume the armed struggle. ( People shouting ) >> Madiba! Untie our hands! >> Listen to me! Listen! >> We have guns, too! Our enemies need to know that! ( Cheering ) >> Wait a minute. Now, the a.N.C.-- ( crowd shouting ) Wait a minute! The a.N.C.--We have-- ( crowd chanting ) Wait a minute. Hold it. We must-- ( chanting continues ) >>Listen to me! Listen to me! Yes, we are angry, and we are full of rage. And we have every right to be! ( Cheering ) But if I am to pick up my gun and pull the trigger, I want to be damn sure I'm aiming at the right target! ( All shouting ) >> Kobie. >> Hmm? Ah. As you requested, Mr. President--the results of the independent British investigation. >> And? >> It confirmed the a.N.C.'S allegations, sir. The police apparently escorted the attackers into the township and then back out again. >> The police? I--i can't believe that the police would-- >> the reports are consistent. There were 39 people shot, hacked, and stabbed to death-- among them a nine-month-old baby, a four-year old girl, and 24 women, one of whom was pregnant. Of the survivors, nobody would talk to the police. They are convinced that the authorities were involved. >> So, the a.N.C. Is not to blame. Mandela was right. We are responsible. I'm going to the township. >> The township? >> I want them to know that I care. >> That's not a good idea. >> There's too much at stake-- the talks, my presidency. >> Sir-- >> I am the president of South Africa. I have to be there. ( People shouting ) >> It's no use, Mr. President. We have to get out. >> Driver. >> I've been a member of the South African police force for ten years. For five years, I've attached to a secret organization inside the police force-- the c-10 unit. We were a hit squad. Our job was to spy on civilian enemies of the state and to commit assassinations when ordered. We delivered money, arms, to buthelezi's inkatha freedom party, for them to use against the a.N.C. We were told that our orders were cleared by top government people. >> I tell you, I knew nothing. >> Don't tell me that. No leader of a nation can claim that sort of ignorance. >> My political career is staked entire on our success, Mr. Mandela. Why would I allow something like this to proceed if i-- >> you chose to see what you wanted to-- >> who are you to accuse me? I have been honest with you-- >> you turned away from that which you did not want-- >> I've staked my career on the success of these negotiations. Now you tell me-- >> and when it was convenient, simply forgot everything in between. That is true, isn't it? >> Think what you will, Mr. Mandela. But I am still the president of South Africa, and I am the one who will determine both of our futures. >> You will determine nothing, Mr. President. Any leader who chooses to remain blind when vision is what our nation needs is a lost man. A lost man can never lead anywhere. >> So what happens now? >> In a few days, there will be the usual exchanges of communique and notes between between our intermediaries. De klerk and I will engage in long-distance name-calling in the press, and after that, god only knows. In the meantime, perhaps you and I can find some time for ourselves at last. What is it, winnie? >> These came today. They are charging me with kidnapping and assault of stompie seipei. >> Mandela: Walter, you know what this case is about. It is an election ploy. By prosecuting her, they hope to do damage to me. Why do you think the government waited so long before they brought her to court? >> It's a pity she's given them so many opportunities. >> Walter, we are all friends, but there is a line. >> Even within the a.N.C., there are those people-- >> you image I care what people think? She is my wife and the mother of my daughters. She has supported me faithfully for 30 years. I will not abandon her now. >> Madiba, you are the father of the nation, a symbol to the entire world. Our country's in turmoil, and the success of our negotiations hangs by a thread. >> I will be faithful to her. >> Madiba, I hadn't meant to raise this, but there's a letter. Winnie wrote it. >> A letter? From winnie? >> In her own handwriting. The press, I'm afraid, have copies. I've persuaded them not to print it before the trial is over. More than that I could not do. >> In finding Mrs. Mandela guilty of kidnapping and assaulting 14-year-old stompie seipei, the judge stressed that no connection has been established between the accused and the death of the young boy. Stompie was allegedly killed by members of a football team sponsored by Mrs. Mandela, some of whom also acted as her bodyguards. The police still have not been able to establish a motive for the murder of the young activist. Suzanne baez, sabc-TV news, Johannesburg. >> They think they have beaten me. I will take their verdict to the appellate division. I have been here before. >> Winnie, you are facing six years in prison. >> Who are they to judge me? >> I held on so tightly to the belief in your innocence. >> And you can continue. Stompie made his choice. I could not have saved him. No one could. >> I didn't even consider the alternatives. >> Stompie was a traitor. No one could have saved him, Nelson. No one could. We were at war. >> With children? >> So, I am to be sacrificed? Madiba... I love you. How could you-- >> oh...don't say those words to me, winnie, not now. Don't use that word to describe what our relationship has been since I was released from prison. This is the early edition of tomorrow's newspaper. Did you think I didn't know? That I couldn't guess? Was he just one more lapse of judgment, or were there others? >> So... Will you leave... Or shall I? >> This is your home. I will leave. We will make a simple announcement. We will salvage what dignity we can. >> Why must you do this? >> Because every cell in my body tells me not to. >> ( Grunts ) ( Gunshots ) ( Grunting ) >> Aaaaah! >> The violence happened on a day of mourning for the assassinated black leader Chris hani. Demonstrators converged on one of soweto's main police stations. The police opened fire on the crowd. Three people died instantly. >> Is that the peace? How should we convince people that-- ( people chanting ) >> I'm aware that there is little trust between US, Mr. Mandela. You must know that the country is in danger of blowing up in both our faces. >> What do you want from me? >> Hani's assassination has brought US to the bring of a race war. I can't stop it. The people--the blacks-- they won't listen to US. I'm asking you to use all your skills. Say something. Talk to your people-- our people. Calm the situation. You're a leader. You have a responsibility to-- >> how dare you say that to me? You, who coddled inkatha. You, who ignored the corruption and venality in your security forces, and pleaded ignorance at the complicity of the police force in all of the political murders throughout our country. And now, when your credibility has been destroyed, you come to me. >> Think of me what you will, Mr. Mandela, but I love this country as deeply as you do. This is my home, too. The elections are not far away. I'm asking you to help me preserve what we have built until then. >> Mandela: Tonight, I am reaching out to each and every South African-- black and white--from the very depths of my heart. A white man--full of prejudice and hate-- came to our country and and committed a deed so foul that our whole nation totters on the brink of disaster. But a white woman-- an afrikaaner woman-- memorized the license plate on his car and risked her life by calling the police and pointing out the killer. This is a watershed moment for all of US. We must, I believe, use our pain, our grief and our outrage, to move forward to what is the only lasting solution for our country-- a democratically elected government, representing all the people of our country. In that--not more killing-- lies the future of our nation. And that is the legacy our fallen son leaves US. We dare not stain it. ( Singing ) South Africa has opened a new chapter in its history.
