Boss will be going to the party. I won't. Come, Chander, you, too, should accompany us. - Come down, Lata. I'm getting late. - No, I will accompany you. - Children don't attend parties. - Then why is mother going with you? I am not going. Come on, come down. No, father. I will accompany you. You're such a nice girl. I, too, get you whatever you ask for. Didn't I get you a toy cat which made sounds when pressed? What would you like to have today? Tell me! All right. Give me this watch. - All right. - Why're you insisting? Come down. Don't say anything now. Here, take it. Come on, Chander. Let's play. It's such a nice watch. No, go with your mother. Come here. Come on, come here What say? If you're seen around, I will beat you. Come on. Get lost. Let's go. Mother, get me a watch. Just a while ago, Lata's father gave her such a nice watch. Where would I get you one? Mother, if you don't get me one, who else will? I want a watch! - What's this? - It's wheat. What's it used for? Do you think I'm a child? You sell wheat flour. - What becomes of the wheat flour? - You bake bread and we eat it. You're right. If we don't eat bread, we can't survive. But one can survive without a watch. - Mother, why do people wear a watch? - Not everybody... Only the fortunate ones can own a gold watch. Your father, too, had a gold watch. Give me that one. - That one... - What happened to it? That watch got crushed in the form of wheat-flour... and consumed by us in the form of a bread. You used to say he'd surely return one day. Son, let me tell you truthfully today. Your father was taken away by God. God left you behind with me as a reminder of your father. And I wonder why God has left me behind. I think about it for hours. But I can't understand anything. Son... Ladies and gentlemen... I feel so sad to inform you that... our dear Deputy has been transferred to Bombay. To tell you the truth... there hasn't been a better supporter of us poor people. We sincerely pray that wherever he lives, he should be happy. I am so thankful for the love of all you people. I am truly saddened to be distanced from you. Who knows, I might get an opportunity to serve you all once again. I once again thank all of you. - Where is Lata? - I don't know. Just check. She must be playing there with Chander. Go and fetch her quickly. It's time for the train. All right. - We're leaving for Bombay. - Why? Father says we've been transferred to Bombay. - When will you return, Lata? - Mother says we won't come back. - Then when will we meet? - When you come there. - With whom will I come? - With your father. I told mother yesterday to write a letter to father... and get me a watch like Lata has. But she said that he can't get one. Neither can he come. - Where is he? - In God's home. - God doesn't let my father come. - If you like my watch, take it. - What will you do, then? - My father will get me another. Here, take it. Whenever I feel like playing with you, I'll play with your watch. Wait, Lata. Let me also give you something. Dear, the train is ready. Everybody is getting angry. Come on. - Wait, I'm coming. - We'll all leave you.. You'll be left alone. Here I go. Wait, I'm coming. Lata! Lata! The toy has broken, my child. It's broken Your life is full of sorrows The toy has broken Everything is in god's hands We are mere puppets All of us are like toys, good and bad Go ahead. Buy the toys They are better than people Buy an idol of god, buy a map of India This is from Japan This is Lallu, this is Gyan This is Kallu, this is Pran Why are you crying Chandrabhan? Don't cry, my child! You are a son of the motherland Buy a bow and arrow Buy some cigarettes and 'paan' My toys cost only two annas. Go ahead kids. Buy them There are paper-made toys, too, which don't break easily The toy has broken, my child. It's broken Your life is full of sorrows The toy has broken Everything is in god's hands We are mere puppets - Where were you, son? - Lata has left. I'm asking you where you were. I was sitting and staring at the places... where I used to play with Lata. - Why are you wasting time? - Why did Lata go away, mother? How can big and small be together? Lata isn't big. She's my own age. She's as old as you. But she was born into an affluent family. And she'll be married to a wealthy man. - Mother, won't I ever see her again? - Why not? You surely can. But to meet Lata, you'll have to study... - and do some very good work. - I'll study hard, mother. I'll do everything so I can see Lata again. May God make it happen. Come, eat food now. Renu, such an enchanting name! She writes equally well. But how did you know about Chander and Lata's childhood events? I'll have to ask you that when I visit you in Bombay. In Bombay I'll have to search for you and someone else, too. Search for whom, you might ask? Lata, I would answer. And who's Lata? There was a girl. Why are the memories of the past coming back to me? Sorrowful tales... and sad melodies Why are they playing? Why are they haunting me? My smiling face.. Hides many tears Why are the memories of the past coming back to me? I wonder why I can't forget... the people of my past I can't stop the melancholy churning within I'm like a fire.. Whose flame is dying out Why are the memories of the past coming back to me? I tried a lot, but Chander couldn't study very much. Now he's become fond of making sitars. I wanted him to be educated and become an inspector. You, too, used to be known as the constable. You too were so fond of playing sitar. Remember, you used to say that a skill is far better than a job. May God bring him success in this field. And may your name become glorious. Eat your meal, dear. What are you thinking? - Nothing. - You're surely thinking something. Mother, shall I go to Bombay? Bombay? What made you think of going to Bombay? Come on, eat your meal now. Who will give you food there? - I am not a child, mother. - Of course not. Open your mouth. Open. You can't even eat food yourself. And you want to go to Bombay. Here... Here, take more. - Yes? - Is it ready? - But I don't make knives. - I mean, is my sitar ready or...? - There's still more to do. - You've been saying that for six months. - You seem to be an idiot. - What did you say? What's six months? It might take fifteen years to do it properly. Return it to me untuned. It might not get tuned even in this lifetime. That too is possible. There's your sitar. You may take it away. How wonderful! This is how business should be. It takes fifteen years to tune a sitar... or maybe you just haven't learned how to tune a sitar? Prakash! When did you come from Bombay? I wrote dozens of letters. But you didn't reply to any. I've only come to meet your mother. Why are you getting angry? I couldn't find time to reply. I can see that. You didn't even make one sitar in six months! You really are wasting your time. Times are such that artists don't have any future. This desolate Jehanabad has no admirers. I've written a thousand times to come to Bombay... invest as much money as you like, and open a shop. I've no objections. But you're one of those who prefers to lead the same life. A lot of your life has already been spent. Some of it remains. That too will pass away. You're prepared to die here. But not to go to Bombay. It's possible that we poor people might not like... the affluent atmosphere of your Bombay city. You aren't too educated. You developed a liking for sitar. In this too, you can't even tune a sitar even after six months? I'll have you make a decision before I leave. Either here or there. It's better if you shift your attention that way. My decision is dependent on my mother's decision. Really? So be it, then. Greetings, mother. Bless you, dear. When did you come, Prakash? I've just arrived. I haven't seen you for a long time. - So I came over to meet you. - Bless you. May you make more progress in life. You should also pray that... I don't have to see you in such a condition again. There are mostly poor people living in this world. If not here, your eyes might have to see such sights elsewhere. Why do you ask for prayers... which God never paid heed to after creating this world? I can't bear to see you in this condition. Instead of explaining to me... Do you hear, Chander? I've been hearing this forever. But the world is so cruel. It doesn't allow any opportunity to understand. I don't want to hear such timid statements. I can't bear to see your mother's condition. A mother who never let her miseries be known to you... a mother who spent her whole life at the grinding the stone... and you never allowed these weak and pure hands to rest. Look at her blisters once. Consider her old age... and look at your youth once. If you stomp on the ground, water can come out of it. But you're hell bent on making her die of thirst. Mother, stop this noise. I can't bear to hear it. Please stop it. The world will go on like this. Nobody can stop it. One cannot stop the world. But I will make you stop this. You'll have to accompany me to Bombay. Please don't refuse. Or I will be disheartened. Please give your assent. Since you're asking me so lovingly, how can I refuse you? May God keep you happy always. The decision has been made. Forgive me if I said anything harsh to you. Not at all. You were showering flowers. I feel as if I am collecting all the happiness from Jehanabad. One just needs two things in life. One, a friend. And two, a wife. - Have you found one? - It's been ages. I was only waiting for you to make the choice. A hundred rupees? It's very expensive. For you, it's very inexpensive. For this price, I should get married instead. That's a good idea. Go ahead. But don't forget me. If a child is born, take home a free sitar. Excuse me. - Is my sitar ready? - Yes, of course. Have you played and checked it? I suppose it's proper. Why don't you play it and check for yourself? All right. Why'd you snatch away the sitar? If you're fond of playing the sitar, then learn how to play it. It doesn't seem to be in tune. How would you know if it's in tune? You don't even know how to play it. I think your teacher is very ignorant. Absolutely ignorant. I'll fire him today. You may teach me. I'm a Rajput. That's surprising. You're more fond of a sitar than a sword? Yes, it's a matter of time. Then take advantage of time, and take the job. - What do you say? - Why waste my time and yours? - Take away the sitar. - All right. - How much do I owe? - 16 rupees and 10 annas. Here's the sitar. Take your change, 3 rupees and 6 annas. - You may keep it. - What for? - As baksheesh. - I won't take any baksheesh. Here's your money. You won't take it? Then I'll throw it away. How can you reject money which has already come in? You shouldn't interfere in everything. Give it to me. I'll return it to her myself. Here it is! - Why did you come here? - To survey the shop. Who are you to survey the shop? Not now. But we'll see what happens in future. - He's not fit to run a shop. - Really? - Shall I take possession? - Get lost, will you? - How's work going? - The shop is doing very well. That's nice. So you've grown fond of it? - I've grown fond since childhood. - I meant the shop. - But who've you grown fond of? - I don't know myself. How wonderful! Everything about you is puzzling. - The entire world is puzzling. - I don't understand. - How am I to blame? - I am to blame. I came just to ask you how the shop is doing. How you are feeling? And whether you're happy or not? As far as the shop is concerned, it's doing very well. As for my happiness, I'm not destined for it. If it's possible for me to make your happiness possible... let me know. I'll try to do something about it. Money can't remedy every problem. If not money, can my hands and legs be of any service to you? - No, that's not possible. - Then God save you. I'm leaving. Two or three races must have already been run. Go and emerge victorious. You work all day and read all night. How can you remain healthy like this? Will you get up or shall I throw the book? Here... - How could you do this, mother? - I've been asking you to eat food. But you're not listening! Mother, you're utterly ruthless. You're right, son. Every mother is ruthless. You became upset, mother? Anyway, pardon me, mother. You're such a fool! - What are you doing? Give it to me. - Take it. - I'll beat you. - I, too, have hands. I'll complain to father. Shall I call out for him? Go ahead! - Father! - Father! - Come here, Munnu. - Here I come. 'Renu' You've written a wonderful book, Ms. Renudevi. It's really wonderful! Do you have a copy of 'Tute Hue Taar'? You're very fortunate. 10,000 copies were printed. I have just one copy left. All copies sold out fast. - All of them have been sold? - Can they remain unsold? - She's an amazing writer. - How nice! - That's why I came rushing. - It's quite natural. - Here's the money. - Thank you. - Give me a copy of 'Tute Hue Taar'. - All the copies have been sold. You might return in a couple of months after it's reprinted. 'Renu's second offering, in fond memory of Jehanabad.' My greetings to the writer of 'Toote Hue Taar'. Bless you. You've written so well! The heart begins to beat faster. One becomes so breathless... and it works like lightning for the broken hearts. I hope you are well. When did you suffer a heartbreak? One of these days. You had better watch out. A heartbreak is very painful. - Even smiles turn into tears. - Really? You speak like an experienced person. Have you suffered a heartbreak? Not something ordinary, but a very acute heartbreak. That's why your songs have so much pain. Here, take 5 rupees. Donate it to some poor person, lest you suffer some misfortune. Yes, father? - Greetings, Uncle. - Bless you. I read your book. It's very well written. - Thanks. - Uncle, you are merely praising. - You should give her something. - Yes, that's why I've come. You like watches very much, don't you? Remember, you received a watch from me during your childhood... which you lost somewhere. Now I've brought a very good watch for you. Take good care of it. - Here... - Thank you. - I hope your mother is well. - Yes. Come to me, my beloved I am incomplete without you Come and make my life complete My tears dry up before falling My desires remain unfulfilled Come and make my life complete I know the consequences of falling in love I hope you'll come back someday Come and make my life complete You are the only one I loved I've waited for you all these years My life is incomplete without you I am forced to say today that Chander is ruining the shop. Really? How did you come to know? I saw it myself. I swear, just a few days ago... a girl gave three rupees 10 annas as baksheesh. Chander was about to throw the money away. I stopped him. So we're losing money, and our Prakash is being fooled. Then what? Chander is filling his own pockets. You should visit the shop sometimes and keep me informed. It would be better if you give me the shop... and send Chander away. All right. I'll get you the shop. Rather, I would say that Chander is handling the shop very well. You may send me away to Jehanabad. Hey! What are you saying? You're changing your statements? Just turn around and see for yourself. I'll be right back. - You must have believed him. - Whether I believe him or not... but to which account should I write the 1,000 rupees? - To the shop's account. - I haven't been able to... - understand the shop account. - Why do you need to understand? Why not? How can one leave the shop in an outsider's charge? Is Chander an outsider? I've know him since childhood. - He's my best friend. - Friends can ruin others. Chander is among those friends who will ruin himself... rather than see me be ruined. You need not interfere in matters between me and Chander. You cannot order me. I am your mother. Then should I leave home and go away? Did I say that? Here's the 1,000 rupees. Come on. Come home. Now that I'm coming home, what are you staring at? Come on. - Do you intend to die or what? - I haven't reached that stage yet. So you spend Sundays chasing cars? Not at all. I thought it was someone I knew. Who's this person who's known to you? - There's a gentleman. - Is it a gentleman or a lady? You suspect unnecessarily. Anyway, don't tell me if you don't want. - What book are you reading? - It's titled 'Toote Hue Taar'. After a very long time... my heart beat faster today again. Just like it used to beat during my childhood. He's likely to be the same person. Otherwise I wouldn't have gazed towards someone so anxiously. Call out to me I'm waiting for you My heart is full of hope I'm waiting for you Come to me. The night is passing Come, it's a beautiful moonlit night Even the stars in the sky... are about to retire Where are you, my love? I'm waiting for you Call out to me My life seems so dreary Oh, why? The stars are witness... to my restlessness I yearn for you Where are you? The sky looms above me like a monster as I wait for you He says I don't know how to play the sitar. He must be right. I might not know how. But he doesn't even understand that melody and rhythm... are related to the heart. If the rhythms of love are formed in the strings of the heart... I would know how to play a sitar automatically. Wake up, dear. It's eight o'clock. What should I do about it? The master is waiting for you to teach you dancing. Tell him my limbs are sore. No dancing today. Your hands and feet hurt because you learn for one day... and stay absent for six days. Who asked you to learn dancing? Once the master was appointed, you lost interest. Come on, get up now. Aha! 'Aawaz' (Voice). If it features Renu's poems, it has a voice. Otherwise it is voiceless. There is Renu's poem. The annual subscription has been worth it. She writes so well. My eyes are sleepless, the stars shine and blink - The sitar has broken again. - Yes, it has. It's suffering from being handled by unskilled hands. I, too, feel pity for this injured sitar. It is voiceless. It cannot even make any pleas. There are just the ears which can hear its silent pleas. Undoubtedly. Sometimes even I am shocked during my dreams. It's possible it might be the impact of its pleas. It's possible. By the way, what brings you here today? I've already told you. The sitar has broken again. Leave it behind. I'll fix it. - When should I return? - In a week. One week? Seven days! That's too long. How will I spend the days? I mean, without the sitar. - It's my hobby, after all. - I'm helpless. It'll take that much time. In that case, lend me another sitar during the period. I'll amuse myself with it. I don't want yet another sitar to be murdered. You are very ruthless. Anyway, I'll return tomorrow. In fact, I'll come and inquire every day. - I'll take it when it's mended. - Why trouble your feet? Not the feet. I have a motor car. You'll be wasting your time. The sitar can't be repaired so quickly. What else do I have to do? Very well then. As you please. - Goodbye then. - Goodbye. What luck! I couldn't solve my own puzzle. And this lady has come with yet another puzzle. My eyes are sleepless, the stars shine and blink Why not write to Renu? If I could meet her, perhaps I would get to know of Lata through her. But where will I get Renu's address? Why not write to this editor? That's it! Ms. Renudevi... I've been an editor for ten years. But before now, I have never received so many letters. This Renu is just a beginner, and so many letters? Here, get these delivered to Ms. Renu's home. I see everything swaying today. I feel as if everything is swaying and singing. I wonder if I'm singing alone, or the world is singing with me. You appear very happy today. Have you seen some saffron fields or what? There are no saffron fields here. Here, only mustard can blossom. You don't need mustard. You are so youthful. And to add to it, there's the sweet syrup of love. I have... lost my heart to someone. I'm in love I expressed my feelings... through my eyes He looked at me with love I blushed My stole slipped off I felt coy My heart I lost... when I met his gaze The love in my heart... fills my entire being My youthful beauty... has an admirer My life has found new meaning I'm in love I have... lost my heart to someone. I'm in love You're reading the letters from your admirers? Give me this letter. Let me read it. Wow! He writes, The most beautiful Renudevi, my greetings to you. Ever since the day I read your poetry... believe me, I have gone mad. I read your books throughout the day... and sleep at night with your books on my heart. May you live and die with the books on your heart. Listen to what this gentleman writes. But he appears to be a serious person. My dreams are visible in your poems. My suppressed cries and stifled sighs appear together at places. I feel as if someone is talking to me. How well written! He appears to be a lovesick person. Finally he writes... Madam, do reply to my letter. I just want to talk to you for a while. - Do call him, Lata. - What nonsense! - We'll get a bad name. - What's bad about it? It'll be interesting. - What if he yearns for us? - He'll get a resounding slap. I'm not ready for this. You stay seated in the car. I'll pose as Renu and meet him. - But where will we meet him? - There are several places. Give me some paper. I'll write the letter. Lata's memento... Perhaps I might find the missing link of our lost world. You'll surely find it. What missing link? You've come at the right time. - May God give you my own life too. - Why's that? Because I have to go on some urgent business. Please look after the shop for a while. I'm sorry, but I'm not free. I'm asking you this decently, because I consider you to be a decent person. I'm not a decent person. All right? Let me tell you, you'll be losing money. - How's that? - The same girl... is going to come to the shop today... who gave that three rupees and ten annas baksheesh. - Really? - Yes. She's arrived. Collect sixteen rupees eight annas and give her the sitar. I'll be back. Is my sitar ready? Yes, of course. - Who are you? - I'm a man. Where's that person who's always here? He has moved ahead. You are very impolite. I'll collect the sitar from him. You don't want the sitar? You want that person? Yes. - I know everything. - What do you know? - Nothing. - Get me my sitar. Here it is. This? What's this? This is a musical instrument meant to be played by ghosts. Here's 17 rupees. My sitar is over there. I'll go get it. - What's your name? - Mohan. You can eat opium for the balance. What a donkey! Excuse me. Are you Renu? Don't be scared. I am Chander. You have called me. Please see who this person is. Just see what he wants. - What's the matter? Who are you? - Excuse me. I am mistaken. What nonsense! Get lost! Let's go. - It appears to be this person. - How would you know? We'll know soon. What's your name? What's your name? - Did you write the letter? - No. If you give me the address, I'll write from home. Get away from here. Let's go home. You'll earn us a bad name. - Get lost. - How can a thirsty man go away... after reaching the banks of the rivers Ganges and Jamuna? Scoundrel! - Why is this person here? - Who? - I'll tell you later. - Where are you going? - I'll be back. - I won't let you go. No, no, let go. Here, the sitar has broken once again. - You've come here too? - What else could I do? I didn't find you there. There was a strange person at the shop. What if somebody sees us here? I'll say I had gone to your shop for the sitar. And when I learned you came here for sightseeing... - I came here. - Please go away from here. Why are you looking around with such a frightened look? So, you're waiting for someone. I know now! I'm the same person. - Who are you? - The same person... - for whom you're waiting. - I'm not waiting for anybody. I come here for a stroll sometimes. Then let's stroll together today. Just see how enchanting the weather is. - Who was he? - You'll know in a few days. Did you bring me with you for this? I won't come with you ever again. Don't get upset. How could I know he'd be here? But he's a strange man. He gets angry at the drop of a hat. He must be pretending to be angry just to impress you. So be it. But he didn't even speak to me properly today. That's because you're always chasing him around. Disappear for a week. He'll search all over for you. But with which heart? Nowadays, when in love... one should use the brain as well as the heart. Look at this. He forgot his watch. I got a memento to amuse myself with. Something lost shouldn't be considered a memento. Return his watch. It's possible it's someone else's memento. Come on. Let's go now. My childhood sweetheart, don't forget me The world will mock me I won't be able to bear separation I won't be able to express my sorrow The world is so cruel Where do I go? I live in the hope of meeting you The world will mock me I spend the night counting stars I wish you were by my side You are so far away... I'm so restless This world has no idea how I pine Come, before the world scorns me No one can understand My loved ones seem so distant My heart weeps. It calls out to you It calls out to you Listen to my plea The world will mock me My childhood sweetheart, don't forget me The world will mock at me Ramu, oh Ramu... - get me some drinking water. - I'll get it. - Has Chander returned? - No. - What's the time? - It's 11 o'clock. 11 o'clock? Chander hasn't returned yet. Where has he gone? Where does he go away? I'll ask him today. Take this. I won't drink. He must be coming any time now. Go and warm his food. He must be feeling scared alone. I've even told him to get married. For how long can I live, looking forward to it? Chander, dear, where were you? You know I've had a fever since morning. I've been waiting for you. Didn't I tell you to return early today? But you never listen. Greetings. It's you, Prakash? Bless you. I'm don't understand everything very well these days. You're suffering from a high fever! Yes, the worst fever is my old age. Come inside, lest you catch cold. I was waiting for Chander. He hasn't yet returned from the shop. He must have got some urgent work. The first responsibility of a son is to serve his mother. There can be nothing more important. - I will surely question him today. - No, no, dear. Please don't. You take rest. Look after her. I'll go and fetch the doctor. Where were you, Chander? I had some business. - Where? - I had some work. Don't I have the right to ask you what was so important? You surely have the right. After all, you opened the shop for me. Tell me, your servant is at your service. Stop your nonsense. I'm not referring to the shop. Then what else? Don't try to hide from me. I can't handle the shop. Arrange something else. Chander, come to your senses. I'm asking you because of your mother's ailment. Don't misunderstand me. Why do you relate everything to mother? Speak frankly. You say one thing, while meaning another. - You're telling me this? - Yes. Today, a poor man raised his hand on the wealthy. No, a friend has slapped another friend. Go and see for yourself your mother's condition. She has a very high fever. I'll go and fetch the doctor right away. My heart rejoices My life is blissful With a smile on my face... with a blush on my cheeks... my heart sings As I miss him... my heart rejoices My life is blissful My feelings are beyond my control My life has found new meaning Love is in the air My life is blissful My heart rejoices I can't reduce the price below 400 rupees. 400 rupees is too much. As you please. - What's your opinion? - Buy it. For a hobby, even 10,000 rupees is a low price. I've only quoted 400 rupees. - What's happened to him? - Perhaps bitten by some scorpion. - Must be crazy. - And made us crazy, too. Let's go home. - What are you looking for, son? - Nothing. I've lost something. - I've lost something, mother. - What's the matter, dear? I've noticed for many days, now, you seem to be so lost. Tell me what the matter is. Nothing, mother. What should I tell you? I've lost something. You won't tell your mother? Tell me. Mother, I've lost something. What should I tell you? Oh God, I cannot ask You to reduce my love for him. But give me strength so I can ask after his well being. You were so worried over this ordinary watch? It's no ordinary watch. This watch is more precious to me than my own life. In that case, your life is in my fingers. How will that help? You are very merciful. How did you find this watch? You were so afraid you dropped it in the park. I happened to see it. You've been very obliging today. Mere words won't do. Get me some baksheesh. Remember, I gave you baksheesh that day? You are very mischievous. What's your name? - Basanti. And what's yours? - Chandra. Every place brightens up with its light. But I remained in the dark till today. Yes, of course. Someone who is always surrounded by spring... how would that person have the time... to glance at Chandra's (moon) spotted face? I'll always look at it. I mean, at the moon. This watch seems to have some deep mystery. - Very deep. - Deeper than the ocean? Yes, much deeper. In that case, I wouldn't be able to reach to its depths. I wouldn't even advise you that. It's very dangerous to try to reach to the depths of the ocean. Very well. I won't try to reach to those depths. But I do have the right to sit on the seashore and count its waves. All right. Goodbye, then. Goodbye. You keep on counting the waves of the ocean... and I, with the help of this watch... will keep on counting the beats of life. Why would you write now, Chandra? Your Lata will herself write to you. - I have much to say to you. - About what? His name is Chandra. And he truly appears to be crazy about someone. Crazy people are indeed very clever. And those crazy about love can make the whole world go crazy. You're right, Lata. He was becoming mad over losing the watch. If he hadn't got the watch, I wonder what would've become of him? You can see for yourself. I'm a poetess. I know other people's pain and sufferings very well. I can guess the whereabouts of the heartbeats... by checking the pulse of love. Gosh, the pulse is so fast. Are you coming straight from there? If you had been feeling as I do... perhaps you wouldn't have laughed like that. I've been playing with fire for years. You've just begun. You'll forget after a few days. It seems like I've been lost in his love. One gains only after losing. I can't give an answer to this today. I've got something else today. I swear, I've got something. What have you got, Lata? - A lost heart. - From where? - From you. - From me? That's the title of my song. What's wrong with you? Nothing. That day you seemed to see everything swaying. Today, I'm feeling as if everything is swaying. My lost love I've found. The world seems so beautiful There's joy all around To be happy always, everyone should be in love Don't think what the word might say My lost love I've found. The world seems so beautiful There's joy all around I still remember everything All the moments spent together My lost love I've found. The world seems so beautiful There's joy all around The eyes speak the language of love The world remains oblivious My lost love I've found. The world seems so beautiful There's joy all around You bring back childhood memories You give me a reason to live My lost love I've found. The world seems so beautiful There's joy all around With this letter, you'll learn the whereabouts of your Lata. I'll be going to Mr. Radhababu's home today at 4 o'clock. You get there between 8 and 9 o'clock. - All right. - And listen... - What will you wear? - I'll wear a suit. The suit again? You'd better wear a sherwani coat. You see, mother, don't ask me to wear a sherwani coat. I appear a bit fat in a sherwani coat. What if the matter...? You'll be attending a joyous occasion. Don't wear a suit. It's very difficult to wear a sherwani coat. Is it easy to bring home a girl after marriage? Mother, if you ask me to wear a sherwani coat, I'll leave home. And if you insist on wearing a suit, then I'll leave home. Hold on, mother. I will wear a sherwani coat. But you'd better make sure you finalize the alliance. Finalize the alliance! A black sherwani, a churidar-pyjama, where are you heading to? A black sherwani, a churidar-pyjama, where are you heading to? - Both of us look very deadly today. - Yes, we do. I've arrived at the right time. Otherwise, you'd have been disappeared. You have to accompany me today. Come on. - Where? - There's a feast for you today. - A feast? Where? - At my future wife's place. Congratulations. I would have surely accompanied you. But I've just learned of someone's whereabouts after several years. - About whom? - My future wife, perhaps. That's not fair. You have to accompany me today. You're not so selfish, Prakash. Selfish? I have made just one request in this lifetime. But at what time, dear? Please consider the circumstances. At such a time, even if God calls me... I'll have to ask for some time from Him too. All right. As you wish. But who's your future wife? Not now. I don't want to bring a bad name to anybody. Then let's use the car. I feel like taking a walk right now. Why are you being so difficult? Let me take you in the car. You want to know where she lives, don't you? Carry on. Emerge victorious. You, too, enjoy yourself. What's the program after the meals, Basanti? How would I know, Uncle? I hear you're responsible for all the arrangements for the day. Are you going to perform your dance after the meals? There's no fixed program. But I can't refuse you. I'll do as you wish. - Bless you. - Bless you. My feet hurt because of dancing for you... - yet you came here? - I'm feeling uneasy. Why are you feeling uneasy? I feel like reciting a couplet. You may call me whatever you like... but I won't let you recite a couplet right now. Tell me something, dear. Who's this poet gentleman wearing a tight pyjama and a sherwani coat? - How would I know? - Yes, of course. How would you know? Is that why you felt shy and left? His features are a bit rough, but he's a nice person. Have you asked if he's a poet or not? Nonsensical talk isn't always befitting. Yes, aunty? They liked your dance so much, they want to see it again. No, aunty. My legs are sore. Anyway, don't dance. But why don't you come along? Why don't you come too, Lata? Let her be. You know, don't you, that she's feeling shy? Come on. I knew earlier that she... I said I wouldn't let her indulge in poetry today. - You still didn't listen. - You have returned again? I was into such beautiful poetry. I had begun such a beautiful poem. I wonder what I was about to say. At this late hour? Aren't you afraid to be in this deserted place? I wasn't alone. My Chandra (moon), too, was with me. Where's Chandra (moon)? Let me see, too. Look over there! It hid behind dark clouds upon seeing you. I couldn't hold myself back. Otherwise Chandra wouldn't have had to hide. Come with me. I want to speak with you. You're never going to spare me. You've become a real pain in the neck. You're right. Wait awhile. Let me bid goodbye to Chandra. Go ahead. Goodbye, Chandra. This menace is taking me away. You may greet Chandra daily. But this menace will never return again. Why are you talking like a mad person? I have been driven mad. - Who made you mad? - You did. - I did? - Did I cause you any harm... that I've had to undergo such a punishment? What are you saying? I don't understand. Are you still trying to hide? You caused me a heartache. You crushed my desires. And I couldn't even know. You knew that I love Chandra. You even knew that he loves only you. But you never told me. Is this what the world means by 'friendship'? Can you still claim to be my friend? It was already too late when I learned. I couldn't tell you. I couldn't find the right words. You had proceeded very far. You only wanted to test your love. To test him and see if he proved himself in love or not. You never considered how your deadly experiment would affect me! I, who begins to laugh heartily, even at a mere smile from you... and who begins to shed tears upon seeing your sullen face. For you love is like the first drop of rainfall. But for me, love is suffocating oneself to death. My dreams are shattered The one I considered my own... turned out to be a stranger It's not the fault of others My loved ones have betrayed me Oh, what it has come to be My dreams are shattered Stop weeping, oh my heart Don't be disappointed This was destined Crying won't help This had to happen My dreams are shattered The dreams I had... have to be forgotten They'll never come true My dreams are shattered The one I love... doesn't love me My dreams are shattered Have you had tea? We asked for water but it hasn't arrived. I wonder how long it takes for tea.. Mohan! Where are you, Mohan? There's neither water nor tea. What should I do? I am alone. I just got the sweet drinks made. - Chander didn't come? - No, he didn't. Why would he? After all, he's the head of the house. Do you believe he's the servant of this house? - Then what? - Shut up, will you? Why should I shut up? I've been here for twenty years. I asked Mr. Prakash to invest some money and help me start a hotel... start a grocery shop, or even a haircutting saloon. - But nothing for me. - Get out of here. - I'm going. - Why're you scolding him? He's right. He's a lot better than Chander. He might be, in your opinion. But, in my opinion Chander is much superior to me. - What does Chander have? - He might not have anything. But he doesn't approach anybody asking for alms. Only after pleading with him a thousand times did he come here. I see that Chander has gained a higher status than myself. He's dependent on us. How can he compare himself with us? You and Chander have your respective places. It doesn't mean you can insult my friend. What a friend he is! Once you have money, there are plenty to plunder it. And when you don't have money, there are no thieves. Mother, you can't call my friend a thief in my presence. I won't stay in this home any longer. Gosh! What have I said? Are you in your senses, Prakash? At whom are you yelling? At your mother? Aren't you ashamed? You shouldn't interfere in everything. This is a matter between mother and me. Your insult is my insult. I won't tolerate it. My dear, you will have to bear it. If you're out to serve the poor, you should be prepared to face insults. Anyway, calm yourself now. There are guests sitting outside. Aha! Your future wife will be coming today. Come on, smile. Or shall I slap you? Shall I? Go ahead. I'm sorry. I was a bit delayed. Would you like to smoke? How about you? - They've arrived. - Excuse me. - Greetings. - Greetings. Please come. Please come. Don't feel shy. He's my best friend, Mr. Chander. And she is... I've already told you about her. Please come. Mother, mother, let's leave for Jehanabad quickly. Hurry up, mother. I don't want to live here. Tell me what the matter is. I'll go mad, mother. I'll go mad. I told Prakash earlier... the affluent atmosphere of the city wouldn't suit me. I can't tell you why I'm going back, mother. - Hurry up, hurry up! - Come to your senses, Chander. Otherwise your madness will destroy you. You'll have to tell me today. Your mother is bound to ask you today. Your lifetime of silence will show its true colors. You can't remain silent any longer. Otherwise I won't go, and neither will you. If you want to go, you'll have to kill me first. - Mother! - My dear son... Your blood is asking you. Tell me. Son, son... Look, the blisters on my hand are asking you. Tell me, tell me. Son, a mother's affection is asking you. Tell me, tell me, my son. Tell me... Mother, I've loved Lata since childhood. I know it quite well. I met her again after ages. She still loves me as deeply. But today my eyes saw something. My ears have heard something, mother. Her marriage has been arranged to Prakash. What do you want now? I want everything. Everything is possible. But I don't want anything. Nothing is possible. Not only I, but even you are under obligation to Prakash. A poor mother's self-respecting son wants to repay the obligations... in the form of sacrificing his love. Bless you, my son. I expected this of you. I told you during your childhood... that Lata was the daughter of a rich father... and would be be married to some affluent man. Mother, let's go to Jehanabad quickly. It's better that a poor man be settled far... from the afflent as soon as possible. Let's go, mother. Come on. What are you thinking, Lata? Love is a storm. A storm cares for nothing. A storm is bounded by neither time nor place. A storm equally affects... the poor people's huts, and the rich people's mansions. Have courage. Take your step forward. Love is calling out to you. Chander's diminishing life is calling out to you. Where are you going? You shouldn't be going. You're ruining this family. You are murdering the hopes of your mother and father. You are bringing a bad name to your family. This home's destruction is asking you to turn back. Respect is begging you to return. Mother's love is calling out to you to turn back. God, what did you get by breaking my heart? My desires are unfulfilled I thought I'd get the love of my life I'd spend my life with him I didn't know you'd separate us... and leave my dreams shattered My desires are unfulfilled God, why did you do this? God is not the only one at fault It's the world, too The aggrieved ones... never find peace I'd rather die than live this life I've lost the one I love My desires are unfulfilled God, why did you do this? I didn't know... our love would meet a horrible death I had no idea... love would ruin me some day I never expected, oh Boatswain... that You would sink my boat of love My desires are unfulfilled God, why did you do this? God, what did you get by breaking my heart? Why did you shatter my dreams? Doctor, doctor. Doctor, doctor. - What's the matter, Chander? - My mother is dying, doctor. For god's sake, save her! Hurry up, Doctor. Why are you staring at my face? Come quickly. Where are you? Where are you, my son? Where have you gone, leaving me all alone? This empty home is killing me. Why doesn't someone come to me? Who is coming? Who is this coming? Why doesn't the approaching person say anything? You? It's you, my husband? You have come? You heard my calls? You have come to take me? I am unable to get up. Lift me. Lift me and take me away. Lift me and take me away. Take me away. Mother, I've brought the doctor. You will recover soon. Mother? Mother! Mother! You, too, left me after getting fed up with me, mother? I was living depending on you. I remember, I often used to go away, leaving you alone. But today, you left me and went away, mother! I have no one to turn to Everything has been taken away from me My heart is broken and my hopes are shattered I'm all alone in the world My life is full of sorrow and darkness I have no one to turn to Will my sorrows never end? People say after every night comes the dawn But I have no one to turn to God, you've taken everything away The world has harassed me You tell me if this is justice I have no one to turn to Tell me who to turn to Everything has been taken away from me Congratulations on the marriage! You haven't got ready yet? Today is the marriage day, son. - I remember it very well. - I'm telling you the truth, son. I sent Mohan to Jehanabad. But Chander can't be found. After all you said that day... no self-respecting man can come to this home. Don't talk like that on this joyous day. The world will get a chance to laugh at us. A human being gets to face the consequences... of all good and evil deeds in the same lifetime. Both, hell and heaven, are right here. You hurt Chander, and God has hurt you on this joyous occasion. Don't talk like this. This is the only joyous occasion. You can eliminate every misery in life with money. Just think, mother. What must those poor people be going through... who have no happiness... who can't buy happiness with money... those who are alive only on the strength of our kind words? I was mistaken, son. If Chander comes, I'll ask him to pardon me. After somebody's death... you're now feeling you were mistaken? Chander will never come in this home ever again. - He is dead for this home. - What will happen now, son? The only atonement for this will be... to take an oath in the name of God and pledge... not to marry until my friend returns. I will definitely not marry. Prakash, I have come! Why are you angry at your mother? It's your marriage day today. Congratulations, Prakash. Congratulations, Prakash. You've come, Basanti? It's nice that you've come. Now your heart must have become clear. Why don't you answer me? Hey! Why are you roaming around all alone? I was right here. Gosh! I forgot to give the gift. Gift? To me? I always have good wishes for you, Prakash. So say that you want to present a gift to my wife. Come on. Congratulations, Lata. Only one thing used to listen to the heartbeats. I'll give that thing to you. I hope you will accept it. I'm making a request of you today. I'm giving you half my miseries. I hope you, too, will accept.
