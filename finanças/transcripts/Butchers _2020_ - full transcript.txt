She was a strict mama. But she was fair. You know, whenever we was in trouble as boys, she would always... Well, that's interestin'. I'm sure it's nothing. Steven? I think someone's out here. What? Someone's out here! I can't hear you. Behind you! Oh my God. Steven! Get up! Get up! Well, well, well. Looks like Christmas came early this year, hmm? I know what you're thinkin'. You're thinkin' I heard about this sort of thing happenin', but I didn't think it would happen to little old me. Well, it has. But you're gonna be famous. You're gonna be on one of those missing persons posters. When they send it out, I'm puttin' it in my window. Not of your boyfriend, 'cause he dead. But you, I'm keepin' you alive. I got plans for you. And thusly, you and I should get intimately acquainted. Don't you think, hmm? Excuse my hands, I know they're cold, hmm? You know what I'm lookin' for, huh? Found it. I'm impressed. Most girls, they try scream, panic. Not you. Celeste. Huh, what a beautiful name. What a great picture. I'm Owen. You already met my brother Oswald. Quiet. A quiet celestial being, hmm? I like that. It's good. It's real good. 'Cause around here... Silence is golden. But I really mean that. You keep that tongue inside your head. You use it, you lose it. You know what you should be doin'. Go on! I hate to leave you hangin' here, but I got work to do. You want to lay down? So tell us what it's like to be 25? Why? So you can look back at this when you're 50. Like she's gonna care. Of course, she's gonna care. 25 years from now everyone's gonna be filming everything they do, okay? Trust me. Why? Are they gonna be as bored as you? Fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck. Jesus! What is it? It's the fuckin' rad... Get that thing out of my face. Fuck. What's going on? It's the radiator, I think. Alright, just what we fuckin' need. I'm gonna walk. Pretty sure there's a gas station up the road a few miles. Do you wanna walk with me? Do you need me to walk with you? Whoa, where you goin'? There's a gas station up that way. If they can't fix the car, at least, they'll have a phone. Okay, what's goin' on? What happened last night? Mm, it's not just last night. He's been lying about where he's been the past few weeks. Some other chick? Uh, I don't know. All I know is I bring it up, he shuts me down. I just wanna go home. Alright, then, I'll... I'll go with him, make sure he gets done quick. Okay. Taylor, where you goin'? To help Mike. Don't go worrying about me. And let go off of the fucking camera. ♪ It's alright, don't you worry ♪ ♪ It's alright, don't you cry ♪ ♪ It's alright, don't you worry ♪ ♪ Because mama's still alive ♪ Hey. What are you doing? Comin' with you. Why? 'Cause I want to. It's just me. I told Chris to hang back with Jenna. I told her there'd be no time wasted. Hey, we got shit tickets if we need 'em. What? Shit tickets. It's better than using leaves. How far out do you think we are? From home? Yeah. About 100 miles. How long to walk that? 3 miles an hour. About 33 hours. It's like a day and a half? Without sleep, yeah. No wonder I never go anywhere. Yeah, well, we should have stayed home last night. You really didn't have a good time? For a guy who likes to videotape people at every moment, you're not very observant. Oh, you can stay here. But what if something happens to you? Nothing's gonna happen to me. But what if it does? Then you'll be wiping your ass with leaves. Mike, your eyeballs are burning holes into my pockets. You sure Jenna's not coming. She doesn't wanna talk to you. She knows you're lying to her. She said that? Mmhmm. What do you think? What I think is that your relationship's over. Has been for a while. So how far away is this gas station? I don't know, another half hour or so. Good. And pull out this time, last time you didn't. What the fuck was that? What was what? I don't know. Didn't you hear that? Wait, you think they're coming? Shit. I told you they're not coming. Neither are we, apparently. Let's just get to someone who has a phone and who can fix my car. Good times. It's weird. I tripped over a wire and I found blood on a tree. So? It was a handprint. A hunter could have gone hunting, killed a deer, got some blood on his hands, and just wiped it on the tree. It's not hunting season. Aren't you worried that he's gonna find out? If I were you, I'd be more worried about Jenna finding out. Yeah, but I'm not the one who's supposed to be her best friend. I'm not her best friend. Come on, Taylor, you're the only girl she brought with her on her 25th birthday trip. Well, she's not my best friend. Yeah, obviously not. I wouldn't worry about it. She finds out, she'll just blame me and stay with you. Yeah, right. Yeah, right. That's what girls do. Did you find it? Yeah. And? I'll give it to you. It's fuckin' weird, but whatever. You know, if it makes you feel any better. I didn't have a really good time last night either. I'm just saying it wasn't all like woo-hoo for everyone there except for you. That doesn't help, Chris. Well, what happened? Maybe I can help. Life. Life happened. This place? Yeah. Looks ancient So what? Let's go. Hello? I'm sure they're just in the back. Hello? Hello? Hello? Mornin'. Morning. Can I help you with somethin'? Yeah, car broke down about 45 minutes back that way. Out of gas? No, the radiator's busted. Ouch! Ooh! Where you headed? Back to Spencerville. You live there? Yep. Together? No, no. We're just friends. Yeah, we're not together. We just fuck. Taylor. Well, let's get you folks back on the road then. So you can fix it? Hell, no. But you still... you don't even know what's wrong with it. I don't need to. I ain't got no replacement radiators here anyhow. Best thing you folks can do is call a tow truck. Get your asses back to the car, you can get towed to Spencerville, and get it fixed there you know, when you're home, safe and sound. Um, uh, okay, yeah, that was plan B so... Well, boy, it's plan A now. You know the number? Off my heart. Willard, got a car, needs to tow. Uh, 2½ miles south of here. Kid says they need to go Spencerville. Mmhmm. What kinda car is it? '81 Monte Carlo. It's a Chev, radiator shot. Uh-huh. Hmm. Says he can be there in a half hour. Great, we'll start back right now. I mean friends are there already, so... Your friends? Uh, yeah. We got two friends back at the car. Oh. He says there's two more of them back at the car. Mmhmm, I know. Well, look, um, why don't you pick them up here? No sense them walking all that way if you're gonna drive past anyhow. Right, right. Alright. Half hour. It's Willard you said? Willard, that's right. Great. What is that? Did he just take our picture? Yeah. Where's your camera? That was fuckin' weird. Did you get it? Where the fuck is this tow truck? Just relax. No, the guy's a fuckin' ass... Hey, keep your voice down. He even talks weird. I'm out. What are you doing? Just pick me up on the way. Pick you up on the way. Fuck you, pick you up on the way. Dammit! Come on. Oh God. Oh, maybe we're gonna be here all day s... Hey, uh, you alright back there? No! You, goddamn bitch, you mother preacher cuss. Come on! Come on, baby. Yeah. What is that? Hobby of mine. Antique. Fuckin' if I get the... Son of a bitch! You okay? Yeah. One goddamn level won't budge. Why don't you let me give it a go? Be my guest. Watch your finger. Yeah, it's on there pretty tight. Why the fuck would did he do that? I'm leaving. Wait. Maybe it's just some weird dude taking photos of shit. Sure, way off the main road, it's miles and miles from anywhere. What is it? It's us. Stay close to me with that thing. Let's get to this fucking gas station. Mike? Hello? Anyone? Help you? Holy shit, you scared the fuck out of me. Oh, well, I'm sorry. Where's my friend? Oh, um, bathroom. I called for him, he didn't answer. Oh, it's... it's in the back, kinda hard to hear. You can go on in if you want. That's alright. I'll wait for him outside. Suit yourself. Where's this bathroom? Mike, come on! Darlin', you wanna talk to him, you go back there. I'm tryin' to concentrate now. It's delicate. Mike! Taylor. Taylor, Taylor! Taylor. Taylor, don't worry. Taylor, come on. Stop! Hey, stop! Stop. Good boy. That is one fine-lookin' piece of meat you got yourself there. You really fuckin' her? Yeah? So you are together. Yeah? You're together. Oh. Now, you just... now, you got me all confused Michael, because if that fine-lookin' piece of meat is with you, then who on earth is this other equally-fine lookin' piece of meat I found in your wallet? Hmm? Mmhmm? I mean they... they similar, but they ain't the same. Huh? Did you just lie to me? Yeah, you did. You been a bad boy, Michael? Yeah, yep. Yep, you have. You've been sticking your nasty little pecker in everythin' you can, haven't you? It's alright. It's alright. We all bad around here. Oh, oh, oh. We're gonna have some fun today. What is it? It's another one. What's wrong? Bitch. That guy took the picture. Just like he took ours. Whatever's goin' on here, it's fucked, and we gotta go right now! But why are they doing this? What? Cheating on us? Yeah. I just... I just don't get it. Okay. First boyfriend, three awesome years together, best friends. He fucked around on me. I wanted to know why just like you do now. You wanna know what he told me? You wanna know why he did it? Because he did. Because it happens. Because people are shitty and that's what people do. And that's the only truth you'll ever get. But I just don't... What the fuck! Run! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, you gotta help me. There's a crazy guy out there. - There's a... - Hold on, alright. - There's... - Well... well, hold on. - There's... - Hold... what happened? - There's a man, he's got my friend. - Calm down. We gotta call the police right now. Alright, alright, I got a phone in the... In the house. Go on, get in. Go on. Alright, we're safe. Alright, it don't look that much, but there's a phone inside. Go on in. Oh, go ahead. I don't think it's working. You're gonna wanna be careful with that. It's an antique. Never ceases to amaze me how desperation makes people so blind. What do you want? What do I want? I wanna lay down some ground rules. Yeah? 1, you speak out of turn to me and I'll blow that pretty jaw off. 2, you do anythin' other than exactly what I tell you to do, I'm gonna shoot off one of your extremities. Maybe a hand at first, I don't know. Do it again, a foot. Do it more than four times, I will blow off that pretty head of yours. Understood? Why are you doing this? Oh, you... You don't... didn't get it? That's speakin' out of turn. You're speakin' out of turn. Understood? Come on, why don't you come help me with somethin'? Go on, you can make yourself useful. Come on. Come on. No. No. No, I don't know. No, go on. Well, go on. She ain't dead or nothin', get her out! Come on. Don't be such a fuckin' sissy. Come on. Let's go! Well, let's not try to kill her in the process, shall we? What are you doin'? Pick her up! Come on. I said, "Pick her up." Pick her up, throw her over your shoulder, and let's walk her inside! No, fuck you! Do not... No. Take that tone with me, you fuckin' cunt! You remember the rules? "You remember the rules?" I said! You pick her up! Pick her up! Pick her up. Go on. You can go ahead and put her over there. That'll do, darlin', for now. "To be... ...or not to be." "That is the question. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune." "Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposin' end them, to die, to sleep, no more." "And by a sleep to say we end the hea... heartache, and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to? 'Tis a con... con... Consummation! "Consummation." "Devoutly to be wish'd to die, to sleep. To sleep, perchance to dream." "Ay, there's the rub, for in that sleep of death, what dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this..." "Mortal coil." Yes, finally, ladies, ladies, ladies, welcome back to the land of the livin'. Oh, well, I thought you was never gonna wake up. Now, that you have, I can see you're both looking good enough to eat. Metaphorically speaking, of course. We don't actually eat people around here, that'll be a little too cliché. Our Ox, however, he developed a taste for that warm, soft human flesh. No accountin' for his tastes. Mine, um, I'm more of a steak man I guess. Like a thick juicy k... Hold on, y'all ain't no vegetarians, are you? Good, 'cause I fuckin' hate those people. I'm sorry, baby. I know those things might be a little uncomfortable, but believe me when I say they are for your own good. You don't understand they're worse things than me here. My brother hears one word out of your mouth, he will cut your fuckin' tongue out. See, he crazy, you know? In the head. Now, who we got here. Let's do these introductions. You must be Taylor, is that correct? Which makes you Jenna. Happy belated, by the way. In case, you all didn't know, I'm Owen. I thought it might be prudent to kick off these proceedings with a little demonstration. Oswald! Honey, he don't like it when people stare. Now, manners are so very, very important, ladies. That's why my brother here is gonna show you fine young pieces of meat exactly what will befall you if you do not do what you're told. Oswald, go ahead. Shut up! Well, ladies, I say that's pretty clear, hmm? No confusion, no ambiguity, wouldn't you say so? We should take your stunned silence as compliance. Hmm? Hey, take him outside. Cut him up while he's still fresh. Go on. It's feedin' time. Goddammit. Hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, listen. Hey, hey, you gonna behave if I take this out? Oh, alright. You're alright. Listen, no need to feel ashamed, lots of people do that. It'll be alright, it'll be alright. What the fuck is going on? Where's Mike? Now. I know, I know, this might feel a little better though, hmm? Do you feel a little refreshed? Well, in answer to your question, Michael will be here shortly. Of course, he may not be in one piece when he gets here, but he will be here nonetheless. Which reminds me, and I don't mean to be the bringer of bad tidings, but this one... She been carryin' on with your old man behind your back. Oh, you already know. Well, ain't that somethin', huh? You know, I read this thing somewhere once. It said the people in this country think that cheatin' on 'em is just about the worst thing you can do to 'em. The second worst is to kill 'em. You find that messed up? I'ma see Michael real soon. You want me to say somethin' to him? You love him? You miss him? Or you hate him? You can tell me. You know, I don't really go in for all that drama, I'm gonna let you two work it all out, get your affairs in order. Taylor. Taylor. What? 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. Get up, get up, get up. Where's the car? What? We called for a tow truck. Oh. Um, this way. This way. ♪ When I die bury me ♪ ♪ Hang my balls on a cherry tree ♪ ♪ When they ripe, take a bite ♪ ♪ Don't blame me, if they don't taste right ♪ Hey, Michael. You awake? Psst. Oh what? Think you're the first pretty boy to play dead to avoid the prod? Yeah, you ain't. And it ain't gonna be the last. Why are you doing this? Why am I doing this? Is that what you said? Why does everybody ask that same fuckin' predictable question? 'Cause it needs doin'. Now, I'd like to take a trip as soon as I can have you giving me any trouble, though. I'd like to put you out again I'm afraid. I know, I know. Oh, I know, I know, but like I said... It needs doin'. Now, I'm in a good mood, okay? So I'm gonna give you a choice. How do you want it? You want Jenna or you want Taylor? What? Michael, that's the real question, yeah. Which girl's Michael gonna choose? Jenna? She's nice, she's feisty. I like that. Taylor. Which one? Which one, which one? Which one? Yeah, you know what? I wanna be surprised. Don't tell me, don't tell me. Oh, there he is. Hey! Hey! Hey. Hey! Thank God, you're still here. Of course, I'm here. You called, didn't you? Yeah, but we need to leave this place right now. Mmhmm, well, that is the plan, but like what the hell happened to you? Some of these guys out there and they... They killed our friend. What? Who? That guy Owen. Owen Watson? And had some crazy, this fucking psycho, he, um... Oswald. I know Owen. Don't know no Oswald. Oh, we have to get out of here! Can we go like right now? Please. Yeah, alright. Get in the car. We can't ride with you? Nobody rides in my baby but me. Now, just get in the car. - Fuck. - Come on, Jen. So um, you know about me and Mike? That's the last fucking thing I wanna talk about right now. I know, I... I just wanted to say that... Don't. I wanted to say thank you for getting us out of there. Yeah, sure. What the fuck? Why did we stop? Get out, girls. I'm gonna give you five seconds to get out of the car or I just shoot you through the window. 5, 4... What do we do? 3, 2... Good girls. Couple of good girls. Now, despite what you might be thinkin', I'm not the bad guy. I'm Willard. What's your name? Taylor. Taylor. I like that name. You? Her name is Jenna. Jenna. Jenna and Taylor. Oh, it's like uh, porno names, huh? Alright. Now that that's over with, start walkin'. You gonna make me count to five again. Now, if you wanted to die, sugar, you'd just stayed in the car. Just do what you're told, that's all you gotta do, just do what you're told! Let me go to her, let me go to her. This is what happens when you don't do what you're told. I'm sorry. No! Where is Oxford? In his den. Shit load of good he does you there. Not allowed to let him out. You ever heard the expression "waste not, want not"? No. Well, basically, what it means is when you lock into pussy that good, you don't go slicing it up. That's a fuckin' waste. You best not talk to me like that, Willard. You don't call the shots around here. When Owen's not around, I do call the shots around here. Open the door. Out. Introduce yourself. You best fix that goddamn door. No. You do what the fuck I tell you to do, boy. Don't call me "boy". Sometimes, I think it'd be best to just blow your goddamn fool crazy head off. Make things a lot easier for the rest of us. Owen would kill you. Yeah. Okay, you just go on thinkin' that. Boy. Don't call me "boy". Oh. Oh my God. I can get us out of here. How long have you been in this place? What's wrong? What? Oh no. You're alive. That's what matters. I'm gonna get you out of here. I'm gonna get your baby out of here. Here, alright, come here. Here. Stop. Willard. One of these days, Owen, that little brother of yours is gonna fuck things up in ways that we can't fix. Alright, what happened? You had two girls up at the barn, right? Yeah. But now, you only got one. They turned the tables on Oswald and they were all but gone. I locked into 'em at the car and brought 'em back, but then he's gotta go and slice one of them up. Alright, hold your horses. Now, what the fuck's goin' on with that? Hold your horses, Willard! This has never happened when your mother was here, do you understand? I mean for the love of Christ, you rein him in! You know, you are here by the grace of one person and one person only, that sure is telling God. Willard! Willard! Oswald! Oswald! Oh, you. Oswald! Oswald! What in the fuck is goin' on? I just passed Uncle Willard on the road. He tells me this whole place has gone to hell! Oh, you can't talk to me? Oswald, hey, what the fuck is goin' on? Oswald! What? Goddammit! What the fuck is this shit? I knew it! You can't do nothin' right. You can't do... you're so stupid, Oswald! Shut up! No, you shut up. Don't talk to me like that!
