Monday on Ask Dr. Susan my guest will be Dr. John Richards, criminologist and author of the book Disappeared. Dr. Richards has defined the psychological profile of women most likely to disappear, women who are at a crossroads in their lives, alone, vulnerable, who find themselves in unfamiliar situations such as business trips, vacation cruises. Dr. Richards and I will be discussing ways that you can recognize if you are at risk and the steps that you can take to protect yourselves. So please join us. I'm Dr. Susan Chancellor. Have a very safe and great weekend. - All right, you're out. Nice work, doc. - Well, thank you, thank you, thank you, Eric, and a masterful job of mixing the callers as always. - Thank you. - Have you got big plans for the weekend? - Could be. How about you? Any social situations requiring any extra vigilance? (laughs) - Sunday afternoon I have cocktails with my father and my stepmother. - Ouch. - Yeah. It's a minefield. (ominous music) - [Charles] Two weeks through the Panama Canal, first class, any time you want to travel, all on me, darling. - Oh, you're so sweet, Daddy. - Anything for my girls. - Thank you. Are you going too, Susan? - No, I'm not real big on shuffleboard. - [Charles] The offer's still open. - I know, Dad, but-- - Ah, ah, ah, ah! Call me Charles. Your stepmother doesn't like people knowing I have daughters your age. - Excuse me. - Thank you. Oh, Susan, this is gonna be perfect. God, do you think that the men on cruises are better than the men in New York? - They're probably all from New York. - Well, at least it'll help me to get over Jack. I'll have one of those, please. How long do you think it's gonna take? Come on, doc, I'm dying of a broken heart, here. - Conflict of interest, Dee. I'm your sister. - Oh, and sisters don't merit the occasional shoulder to cry on? Look, Susan, I'm sorry that Jack left you for me. I just should have know that he would do the same to me one day. - Well, at least we're luckier than Mom. Jack didn't take 20 years to show his total lack of taste. - Have you girls met the guest of honor yet? - The guest of honor, Binky, or the next family that you would like us to marry into? - Mm. That is Aidan Masters. - [Dee] As in the Masters Museum of Art? - Not to mention the Masters Performing Arts Center and the Masters Charitable Foundation. Very rich, very single. - And very cute. - Mm-hm. - Go on, Dee, give it your best shot. - [Dee] Oh, I will. - The gazebo is through those doors. Oh, excuse me. - Would you settle for champagne? (laughs) - Anything would do right now. Thank you. - Aidan Masters. I'm a friend of Binky's. - Yeah, I know. She told me. - Oh, you see, the pitfalls of inheriting millions of dollars. I'm telling you, people gossip about you, they besiege you for grants and donations. It's enough to drive a man crazy. - Be careful. You're talking to a shrink. - Yes, I know. Binky told me. You're Ask Dr. Susan, aren't you? - Mm-hm. - Do you know, I've listened to your show, and I think you counsel with a great deal of compassion. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Another party like this one, and I'm the one that's gonna need counseling. Except I'm too cheap to hire a therapist. - Maybe my foundation could front you a loan. - Mm. - So what field of psychology is your specialty? - Clinical. - Clinical. - Mm-hm. - I don't know, that conjures up all sorts of images of someone with gray hair and spectacles. Definitely not a beautiful woman like yourself. - Well, most of my Sundays are spent in very bulky sweaters and jeans if that is a more comfortable picture. - I happen to think you're perfect the way you are. - Aidan, there you are. - Ah. I'm sorry, but your sister has agreed to show me around. - Oh, go, go ahead, go. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah, it's a pleasure. (sighs) Enjoy the tour. - Hey, the Giants game is on. So it looks like we're football widows for the rest of the evening. What? It's a good thing. It reminds me of our college days, remember? Those quiet October Sundays, girls' night in. - Right. And after our second bottle of wine, you'd start doing your psychic reading thing to see if we'd pass or fail the semester, remember? - [Pamela] Ah! - And you were always right. How did you do that? - What can I say? I have a gift. - Do you still? - No. Oh God. No, not since I missed what the future held with Mr. Wrong. - Why is it you and I were always the last ones to figure out where our lives were going? - I don't know. So. How are things going with Jason? (sighs) I see. - Can you believe it? It's almost two years ago this month since I took that cruise. You know, to think things over while we were separated? - Oh yeah. Wow. It's already been two years. Hm. So do you have any regrets? You know, I always secretly kind of hoped that, I don't know, while you were on that cruise you'd just ditch Jason and find someone else. - I almost did, you know. - Yeah, right. Are you serious? Oh my God, are you serious? I cannot believe that you did not tell me this! - Sorry. - I'm sorry? Who is this guy? Are you serious? - [Carolyn] He even gave me a ring. - Oh my God! "You belong to me." Are you sure this isn't from Jason? - No. - It kind of has that, you know, warm possessive psychotic feel that he's so good at. - No, this guy was, he was warm, he was kind, he was considerate. I always wonder what happened to him. - I got a great idea. Come on, sit here. Let's test out my psychic abilities. - No. - Yes! Come on! - Really? - Yes! Come on, come on. (suspenseful music) - What happened, what did you see? - It was horrible. I don't know, I saw, I saw a woman who looked like she was dying or something. Carolyn, this is not good. You have to get rid of this ring. I'm not kidding. You have to get rid of it. - He could be a child molester, the way he's looking at those kids. - Hilda, leave him alone, he's a drunk. - Will he leave those kids alone? Have you checked his I.D.? Have you run him through the computer? - Hilda-- - Well, have you, officer? - [Hubbard] Morning, Tom. I was just telling Hilda here-- - Will you tell him to do his job, Shea? That hump is trouble, I can tell. - Why don't you see if the guy's got identification and call it in, huh? - All right. - You've gotta stay on your guys, Shea. They're getting complacent. - Not much worry of that with you around, Hilda. Excuse me, I gotta rattle somebody else. Hey, you. You owe me lunch! (laughs) - Anytime. How you doing, Tom? - Ah, you know. Overworked. I don't have a cocky assistant D.A. backing me up anymore. So what brings you back to my precinct? - Oh, my new office. I just moved in. - Oh, well, then you don't have any more excuses for not looking me up, huh? Station house is around the corner. - Yeah, I remember. - Uh, Shea. - Yeah? - He's got some outstanding warrants. - What did I tell ya? - Uh, excuse me, huh? Hey, don't forget that lunch, huh? - Oh! (sighs) Oh! - Power's off, Dr. Chancellor. - It was off all day yesterday, Ernie. I can't have my clients climbing all those stairs. - Yeah, well, I told you you didn't have to move in during the reno. All my other tenants were willing to wait. - I'm just the one that believed you when you said you'd have it done by now. - Hey, listen, I brought you in another tape today, huh? What do you want to listen to today? Annie Get Your Gun or Cats? - Ernie, you've gotta be the only maintenance guy in New York who's into show tunes. - Yeah, I know what you mean. Me and the guy from the Village People, right? Y-M-C-A! - I spend hours in her bedroom. I've kept it intact, like a museum. Sometimes I imagine Victoria's there and we're having tea and swapping gossip. Do you know, I sleep with the phone on my pillow every night just in case she calls. But I still, I wake up every morning with the same empty feeling, not knowing what happened, whether she's dead, whether she's alive. - I feel I'm failing you. Or I've become a surrogate. - A surrogate? - Instead of having tea with Victoria, you come and you spend an hour with me. - Are you suggesting that I find another therapist? - No, I am suggesting that we try something different. I'm interviewing an author today. He has a great deal of insight into why women disappear and how those left behind can cope. - No, no, I won't let you discuss Victoria. My daughter doesn't deserve to be turned into a media spectacle. - No. Lois, you know I wouldn't do that. But you deserve some peace. You need closure. Look, my program is heard in 10 states. Someone who knew Victoria on that ship may be listening and call in. And if you're there, then you can verify if they really knew Victoria. - I have to meet my lawyer, Mr. Blake, this afternoon. - I'm sure that he would agree to meet you at the radio station. - Oh. You have thought of everything, haven't you? - It's my job. ♪ Ah - [John] Many people look at their lives one day and just decide to do a U-turn on the way home. They simply start a new existence somewhere else. - Why? - It's usually attributed to problems with money or matters of the heart. - How do you know that it is not foul play? - That's hard to determine, especially if no body is found. Hundreds of women disappear each year, not leaving a trace of their whereabouts. - And families grasping for hope. - It's a constant agony, not knowing the true fate of your loved ones. - Mrs. Clausen, what are we doing here? - Dr. Chancellor's talking about Victoria's disappearance. She thinks it may help. - Shouldn't we have discussed this? I'm in charge of administering Victoria's affairs. - You're also in charge of investigating her disappearance. I would have assumed that you would like to explore every avenue. - You're right, I'm sorry. It's been a hectic day. I do need your signature on the Guatemalan project, the orphanage. - It can wait. - Before we go to our calls, I'd like to talk about a case that is not mentioned in your book. Victoria Clausen. Miss Clausen was a financial advisor and a socialite, and she disappeared off the cruise ship Abriela during a stopover in Hong Kong three years ago. If you were starting an investigation, what would you do? - Well, I'd check the passenger list for someone she'd been friends with, particularly a man traveling alone. - A shipboard romance that she tried to keep secret? - Yes. I can't speak for her emotional state at the time, but many women take cruises to find companionship or recover from a broken relationship. It's not uncommon for an unscrupulous man to prey on those vulnerabilities. Ply her with gifts, offer comfort and understanding that further breaks down her defenses, and then-- - [Susan] And then? - A shy or lonely woman is particularly vulnerable when she's out of her family environment, away from the security of her job and family. - Well, let's go to our callers. Louise. Hi, Louise. - [Louise] Hi, Dr. Susan. Can you ask Dr. Richards about his own wife? She vanished, and she's not in his book. - My book deals with cases of foul play. My wife, my wife drowned. Her passing does not relate to what we are discussing today. - Thank you, Louise. Our next caller is Karen. - Yes, Dr. Susan? Hi. I'm calling because I was just listening to your program, and it's funny, because I took a Mediterranean cruise on the Abriela two years ago. I was separated from my husband at the time, and I was feeling kind of miserable, actually. Anyway, I met this very charming, very attentive man, who suggested that I go ashore with him to visit the Casbah. - [Susan] The Casbah, the famous marketplace in Algiers? - [Carolyn] That's right. - Rosemary. - What? - Come here. - Did you do what he suggested? - [Carolyn] I was going to. - That sounds like Mr. Wells' wife. - [Carolyn] At other ports we explored the sights together, but we always returned to the ship separately. - Separately? - I know it sounds a little secretive, but he insisted he just didn't want to expose me to any shipboard gossip. - How thoughtful. So what happened next? - My husband called. He convinced me that he deserved another chance. By that time the gentleman had gone ashore. I never saw him again. He never came back on board. I found out he'd only buy his passage as far as Algiers. - He never told you that he was leaving the ship in Algiers? - No. You know, I didn't think very much of it, I just... But when I tried to contact him at the address he'd given me, it didn't exist. So now I'm listening to your program, and-- - Karen, is there anything more that you could tell me about this man? - He gave me a turquoise ring. He had it inscribed. It says "you belong to me." - [Susan] Do you still have the ring? - [Carolyn] I have it with me right now. And I do have a picture of him. It's one of those cruise ship photos they take. - [Lois] "You belong to me." - Karen, this could be very important. Do you think that you could bring me the ring and the photo to my office? - No, I'm sorry, I really can't get involved. If my husband ever knew about this, he would kill me. - Mm, you're not kidding. - Karen, I promise, I will protect your privacy. My assistant will give you my address, and could you come by at three? - I'll try. - [Susan] Thank you. - Mrs. Clausen, I don't think you should stay for any more of this. I'm sure it's very stressful, and the board is meeting this afternoon-- - Well, you can tell the board that they will have to wait. You and I have another appointment. - Another appointment? - Dr. Chancellor's office. If that woman has a ring like this, we are going to be there. - Very well. But it's very important that I get your signature on these papers. - Not now, Douglas. - Victoria said the orphanage was very important to her. - You never met my daughter. - I mean, that is what you told me. - I never said any such thing. - [Barbara] Mr. Wells, I moved your four o'clock to three, and your dry cleaning is in the front hall. - Thank you. - And I just heard Carolyn on a call-in radio show. - Carolyn? Really? What did she call about? - Something about a cruise she took? - Lois, I know-- - Dr. Chancellor. I really wish that you would have discussed your intention to revive Victoria's disappearance with me. - Douglas, be quiet. Susan, I think you were right. I think Victoria met a man on that ship. - Mrs. Clausen, please. I personally oversaw the investigation, and there was no evidence to suggest-- - Douglas! Will you stop? Now, this ring was returned with Victoria's belongings from the cruise. It is exactly like the one Karen described. Do you think it could be from the same man? - Perhaps. - I need to meet this woman. - I promised that I would protect her identity. - Mrs. Clausen, your doctor's right. The board is meeting soon, and I have to be there. And you should be there too. - Fine. You suit yourself, and I will catch a cab. Now, I'll wait in your inner office. She doesn't need to see me. But I will be there. - All right. - Dr. Chancellor, if Victoria Clausen was murdered, the killer may have been listening. You could be putting Karen or Miss Clausen at great risk, not to mention yourself. - Karen's photograph could be crucial to solving Victoria's disappearance. - I doubt she will even show up. She sounded very unsure of herself. You could be giving Miss Clausen false hope, and that's just not ethical. - Taxi! If Karen has what I think she has, I'll give you a call, Dr. Richards. It might just actually give you a chance to find a woman who's disappeared. (car engine running) - [Tom] Damn burgers are incinerated. - Just the way you like 'em. - Why did we come here, anyway? - Old habits, I guess. We always used to come here after you testified in one of my cases, and you always brought here to tell me how I could do my job better. - I couldn't teach you anything. I just liked having coffee with you. You were a great prosecutor, Susan. I'll never understand why you gave it up to be a shrink. - Preventative medicine, Tom. Yeah, it's an antidote to crime. Makes your job lighter. - Are you clockin' your lunch, or you just can't stand my company anymore? - I gotta get back to the office by three, but I wanted to talk to you about Victoria Clausen. - Now I'm really gonna get indigestion. - You were in charge of the case, Tom. Anything being done on it? - Unsolved murders are always open. - Hmm. I'd like to see the file. - Bad enough you're tryin' to poison me, and now you want me to get fired? - Victoria Clausen's mother is my client. She's been agonizing over what happened to her daughter for years. - I don't need a psychological profile to know that woman was murdered. - And I'd like to see two passenger lists, one from the Abriela, Victoria's cruise, and one from a Mediterranean cruise a couple of years ago. - That shouldn't be too difficult. - And the file? - I'll think about it, all right? You want to grab a coffee later? - Sure. If you bring me the file. And Tom? I could always stand your company. (suspenseful music) (screams) - Jason, you scared the living daylights out of me! Don't do that! What are you doing home, anyway? - Thought I'd drop by. Glad to see me? - [Carolyn] Of course I am. You just scared me, that's all. - You know, Barbara said that you were on some talk show this morning. She said you mentioned something about your mysterious cruise. - Jason, enough with the suspicions. - Carolyn, you had a lover, didn't you? - No. And I'm not having this conversation. - Oh, but it's all right to tell the whole world! Are you still seeing him? - Jason, I am warning you. I can't go through this again. I can't cope with your-- - Then answer me! - There is no one! There was no one. I'm with you. Why can't you get that through your head? (suspenseful music) (sniffles) (car engine revving) (Carolyn screams) - Oh! (ambulance siren blipping) - [Hubbard] Okay, all right. Yeah, so you were saying that was basically the case? Thanks very much. I'll call you if I need you. - They're all blind. She was pushed. - What have we got, Hilda? Another psychotic derelict? - Don't get smart. This district is going to hell! A man in a raincoat pushed her. - Everyone here says it was an accident. - Well, it wasn't. He stole an envelope from her too. - Thanks. You've been a great help. - Oh, don't blow me off, flatfoot. I saw his face. You take my statement, or I'll go to Detective Shea. - He's off duty. I got people with places to go. Now, I'll take your statement, but you'll have to wait your turn. - Hey! That woman was pushed. I know she was. Nobody is gonna tell Hilda Dobson that it was an accident because it wasn't. - She's not gonna show, is she? Keep this in case she contacts you. The chemo's not working. It would have been a great relief to know what happened to Victoria, but... There's something else. My lawyer, Douglas Blake, I always felt somehow his investigation was lacking. - Lois, the police didn't have any luck either. - I made him director of the family trust. He seems to be doing a good job, but sometimes I'm not so sure. (ominous music) (dramatic music) (metal crashing) - Hey, Abdul! Why don't you come spruce my place up too? Oh, no, no, no, not another junkie shoplifter. Well, Brabo the elephant god will protect us. At least, that's what you promised me when you carved it. - [Doctor] Mr. Wells? - How is she? - [Doctor] Your wife has suffered a severe concussion. The brain swelling is down, but it's too early to tell. - Can I go and see her? - You can see her once she's been stabilized. In the ER, she kept calling out Win. Is that someone she knows? - How the hell should I know? I don't know! - Mr. Wells, you won't be much good to your wife in this state. Now try and relax. You will see her shortly. - [Susan] Frankly, I'm surprised you called. - [Aidan] Why's that? - [Susan] I thought Dee would have gotten her claws into you by now. - [Aidan] Her claws? (Aidan laughs) I'm sensing a case of sibling rivalry, Dr. Susan. - Mm, just a little. - Little bit? Well, you know, I don't think you have to worry, because I get the feeling that Dee attracts attention by playing the martyr. - Oh my, that is very astute. - [Aidan] Yeah, well. - She can't help it, you know. Wealth and status are just things that Dee finds irresistible in a man. - Men like me? And Jack? - Jack. Jack and I were close. And then along comes Dee. Darling of the fashion world. There were men waiting in line to marry her. But oh, no, she had to have Jack. Jack eventually left her. And Dee is still getting over it. So am I, because he didn't leave her for me. - Well, I think you have a very healthy outlook on relationships. - Yeah, well, I spend so many hours with other broken hearts it's really hard to know what's worse, lost love or loneliness. - So you studied law. What made you become a psychologist? - Oh, I prosecuted a woman once who killed her husband in a jealous rage. And then I realized that had she gotten treatment earlier, all of the anger that destroyed both of their lives, it could have been prevented. - Yes, grief can turn into anger. - Oh yeah, it can. Okay, that's enough about me already. - No, not nearly enough about you. - That woman was pushed. I know she was. Nobody can tell Hilda Dobson that it was an accident when it wasn't. Oh, that meathead Patrolman Hubbard treated me like a child, officer. Did you see him blow me off? He treated me like a child. Eight a.m.? You bet I'll be there. Tell Shea to get ready for an earful. Ooh, I'll bring some sticky buns. I'm Hilda Dobson, and I know exactly what I saw. - Assistant recreational director, S.S. Abriela? (doorbell buzzing) - Who is it? - [Man] Mrs. Dobson? Detective Anders. Sorry to disturb you so late, ma'am. - Is this about the accident? - [Man] Yeah, well, we may have a suspect. I'd like to show you some mugshots? - I thought Hubbard didn't have anything. - [Man] Ma'am, I can't hear you very well. Can I come up? It'll only take a minute. - Well, okay. Well, watch the stairs. There's a bulb out. (suspenseful music) (knocking on door) - [Man] Miss Dobson? It's Detective Anders. - You. (police radio chattering) - You called for me? - Hilda Dobson could be a pain in the ass, but she didn't deserve this. She left me a message last night about the Carolyn Wells accident. - [Hubbard] Meaning? - Meaning? A woman who says she saw Mrs. Wells being pushed in front of that van is dead now. - Every other eyewitness said the woman fell. Just 'cause Hilda said-- - I want a, I want 'em all questioned again. And I want a report on everything Hilda said on my desk forthwith. - [Susan] Dee, hi! What are you doing here? - I have an audition down the street, and I wanted to see if you wanted to grab some lunch after your show. - Oh, honey, I can't. I'm so busy. - All right. Maybe I'll call Aidan Masters. You wouldn't mind, would you? - Why would I mind? - I don't know. He was asking a lot of questions about you on Sunday, and I thought maybe you might be interested in him yourself. - Oh, you did, did you? - Well, he's a catch. He's rich, handsome. Look, Suze, I'm just trying to be careful, okay? I don't want what happened with Jack to happen again. - Come here, honey. - And I really like this guy, Susan. Not just because he's charming and he's rich and-- - Stop. Can I break the rules here and give you some professional advice? (laughs) - I don't know, is it gonna cost me? - You are very vulnerable right now. You need to take time for yourself. You need to be alone. Getting involved with another man right now-- - Yeah, I know, I know, okay, but he's different. So you wouldn't mind, would you? - No, no, I wouldn't mind. - You're the best. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Good luck. - [Dee] Thank you, goodbye. - Hi. Jason. How's she doing? - [Jason] Still in a coma. - Hi, darling, it's Pam. Listen, um, I'm planning a little recovery party, and I've ordered the champagne and the caviar-- - Pamela. She can't hear you. - Well, I heard that they can. And I'm trying to give her a little something to look forward to. Maybe you should try that. (cries) - It's all my fault. We had an argument. If only she hadn't run out and away from me. - You need to put better lights in that hall. You can't see a damn thing. - Renovating. - When are they gonna finish? - Last month. Thank you. - [Tom] Passenger list tell you anything? - No matching names. If Karen got her ring from the same man as Victoria, he's using an alias. - That would make sense. - Could you do a check on someone for me? A lawyer, a Douglas Blake. - A lawyer. Huh, my pleasure. Do you think he's got something to do with this? - He's the director of Lais Clausen's family trust, he supervised the private investigation for her. - Right, I met him. He struck me that he was just going through the motions to keep the old lady happy. - Tom. Karen said she had a photo that the cruise people took. So that means that the ship takes photos of the passengers, right? - Yeah, right, it's a big moneymaker. - Do you think they keep the old negatives? - Mm, you're good. Real good. Anything else in there you need? 'Cause I gotta get that file and me back to the precinct. People keep dying in this city all the time. - [Susan] Another murder? - Architect's wife named Carolyn Wells got pushed in front of a van yesterday. - Ouch. - No, she's hangin' in, but the lady who saw the pusher turned up dead this morning. Yeah, Ruggerio. Listen, how'd you like to get something on a lawyer? Yeah, I thought so. (opera music) - [Douglas] Shouldn't you go back to the hospital? - No. I'm not gonna let this damn cancer beat me. But thank you for your concern. - Not at all. Can we talk about the orphanage in Guatemala? - [Lois] What about it? - Well, I realized that you are right, that we never really talked about it. But for the sake of those kids and your daughter's memory, can we close the funding? - What's the hurry? - The rainy season's coming, and if they don't start now, I'll fly down myself and authorize construction. - Huh. You'd do that. Why? - I got the impression it is what you and Victoria wanted. - Where's the paperwork? (sniffs) I will read this over, and I will call you when I've made my decision. - Mrs. Clausen, it's very important that we-- - When I have made my decision, Douglas. That will be all. - Jimmy, it's Douglas Blake. I know, I know, I know I'm late, but things are finally coming together. Yeah, I know I told you that a week ago, but these things take time. I'm gonna come through for you. I've never let you down before. Jimmy, listen. I swear this is gonna work out. It's all gonna be over by the end of the month. That's right. By the end of October. - Mr. Wells, can you account for your whereabouts on Monday afternoon between two and three? - I was walking back to work. - From your apartment? Had you seen your wife? - Briefly. - What transpired between you? - Nothing much. - Nothing much? My officer at the hospital overheard you say you had an argument? - It was just a difference of opinion. - A difference of opinion. Yeah, that's the phrase you used two years ago when Carolyn filed a domestic abuse complaint against you, huh? Do you often threaten your wife with bodily harm, Mr. Wells? - She dropped that complaint. - You mean she didn't use it in court. - Look. I get jealous. I have a temper. But I-- - What were you wearing on Monday? - What? - What were you wearing on Monday? - I don't know. A suit, a coat. - What kind of coat? - I don't remember. - Do you know a woman named Hilda Dobson? - No. - She was found murdered this morning. After insisting that someone had pushed your wife in front of that van. Now, you know, Hilda was the kind of woman that would never open her door to a stranger. But she might open it to, say, the victim's husband. - Are you accusing... Am I under arrest, detective? - Not yet. But I'd keep myself available. You're free to go. - When my wife wakes up, she's gonna tell you I had nothing to do with this. - Good. I look forward to that. - Once again, Karen, if you are listening, please know that you can still reach me anytime. Now let's go to our next caller, Tiffany. - Oh wow, I got through! Hi, Dr. Susan, I am a big, big fan. - Thank you. - Now, I just wanted to say to Karen she was lucky. That guy who gave her that ring was a real cheapskate. - Why do you say that? - Well, 'cause last year Matt, my ex-boyfriend, he gave me a turquoise ring with "you belong to me" inside the band. It only cost 10 bucks. - Really? - Yeah, we bought it in one of those cheap souvenir shops down in the Village. No wonder Karen's guy gave her a phony address. He was probably some loser from Queens like Matt. - Tiffany? Do you think that you could bring me that ring? - Sure. Oh, and can I give Matt a message? Loser! (Tiffany laughs) - Well, I guess I don't need to give Tiffany any advice about moving on from an unrewarding relationship. I'm Dr. Susan. We'll be right back after these messages. - Very funny. Very, very funny. Okay. Susan. I know you're in a rush today, but I need you to sign those letters to all the tapes we're mailing out. - Jason Wells? Why is that name familiar? - I did tell you that we are drawing classy listeners. All right, here it is, check this out. "Carolyn Wells, wife of prominent architect Jason Wells, "was struck--" - "Was struck by a van on the corner of..." That's a block from my office. - Okay, and we have less than 20 seconds. Can you please sign those? - Yeah. "Struck by...2:45." (ominous music) (bell jangling) - Don't tell me. Another ring, yes? It so happens I made two more. (phone ringing) - Wells and Associates. - [Susan] Dr. Susan Chancellor for Mr. Wells, please. - I'm sorry, he's on another call. Can I take a message? - Uh, yeah, could you tell him that I have the tape that he ordered from my radio show? - Dr. Susan, I am a huge fan of yours. I listen to your show every day. - Could you just get him? - I'm the one that told Mr. Wells that Carolyn called in about the cruise. - It was Mrs. Wells? - She used a different name, but have you heard what happened? - Yeah. How's she doing? - [Barbara] Still in a coma. Listen, I don't know how long Mr. Wells is gonna be on this other call. I'm sure you can imagine it's been a bit of a crazy day. - Yeah, just have him call me, okay? Shea. Stay where you are, order a pizza. Tom! Tom, Carolyn Wells was the woman who called my show. The one on the cruise. - I know. - You know? - You're not the only one playing detective around here. We searched her apartment this afternoon, found your address on a scratch pad next to the phone. Have some before it gets cold. You still like anchovies? - You know I hate anchovies. So I was right. She was bringing me the ring and the picture. - Uh-huh. I got something else too. Two women who disappeared on the Abriela, one in Egypt, the other Algiers. - Not during the same cruise that Carolyn took. - No. One on the last October cruise of the same year, and one in October of last year. Now, both women only booked their cruises as far as the ports where they went missing, so the police never connected them to the ship. - Tom, Victoria's cruise was in October. - I know. This is way too much to be a coincidence, and I don't have to tell you what month it is. - October. - Right. (ominous music) - Hello? Anybody there? (keys jangling) "Thanks for a lovely evening." (gasps) - Nice, huh? Some guy slipped me 10 bucks to sneak 'em into your office. Hey, what a day we have today, huh? 42nd Street. - Ernie, when are we gonna have electricity that I can depend on? - Today. Tomorrow the latest. - What about the alarm system that was supposed to be in last week? - It's a little bit more complicated than I thought. - Yeah, well, figure it out, because I can't even hire a receptionist until that's done, and quite frankly I'm sick and tired of feeling uncomfortable in my own office. - All right, all right. Look, I'll get on it right away. I'm sorry. (door closing) - Ernie! I love 42nd Street. - [Ernie] Ha ha! - It just has to be the same ring that Carolyn Wells was bringing me. Have you got anything new on her accident? - Hubbard. - I talked to everybody again. Two of the witnesses now recall the man Hilda claimed pushed Mrs. Wells, but they can't describe him, and they didn't see him push anyone. - But all three said that she was carrying a manila envelope. Which is missing. - What about the cruise photographs? Any luck? - Oh yeah, they'll be here in a couple of days. And since you're a big-time radio personality, I said you'd pay. - You're all heart. - Thanks for noticing. - You know, if she was pushed, it just has to be someone that knew her, that recognized her voice. - Susan, just remember something. This isn't the grand jury office. - What is that supposed to mean? - If the man who pushed Carolyn Wells killed Hilda, then he's gonna go after anybody who starts snoopin' around. - Well, maybe that's why I am gonna let you do the snooping. - Promise? All right, I just wouldn't want to see you getting into any trouble, all right? Okay, let's start with Jason Wells. Now, he's got a domestic assault charge against him and an affidavit filed by Carolyn indicating violent and possessive nature. Oh, and he was seeing a shrink about it. - Really? Who? - Your pal, John Richards. - [Dee] I'm not keeping you from giving away any more millions, am I? - No, not at all. I do appreciate you putting up with the boredom that surrounds it, though. - I hope you don't think I'm too pushy for inviting myself. - No. In fact, I feel like I still owe you a favor. - Well, perhaps I can collect this evening. I'm in the market for a new condo on the East Side. Perhaps you have some ideas. - Whereabouts on the East Side? - Uh, somewhere between Park and Fifth, the upper 70s. - My neighborhood. - Really? (laughing) - I think I know a real estate broker who could help you. - Thank you, Aidan. You're so kind. - Is there anything else you need? - Well, since you know the neighborhood, maybe you wouldn't mind coming to see a few places with me. I would love your advice. - Sure, why not? Finding the right place takes a great deal of attention. - Right. Cheers. - Cheers. - Okay, let's go over what we've got. Victoria Clausen disappears in Hong Kong three years ago this month. - And a ring inscribed "You belong to me" turns up in her belongings. - A ring her mother swears she never owned before she went on vacation. - Yeah, absolutely, that's right. - And a year later Carolyn Wells gets the same ring, we think, while on the same ship, and probably from the same guy. - And during the Abriela's next cruise, a woman disappears in Algiers where Carolyn was supposed to secretly go ashore and meet her unknown admirer. - And a year later another woman disappears while on the same ship in Egypt on a shore excursion to the pyramids. - The pyramids? - Mm-hm. - You didn't tell me that. - It's in the report. Anyway, it probably doesn't make much difference. If she was leaving the ship there, she could have met up with this guy anywhere. - No! No, Tom. "See the pyramids along the Nile." - What? - It's the song, don't you see? It's the song You Belong to Me. Okay, the first verse. "See the sunset on a tropical isle." Victoria. The second verse. "See the marketplace in old Algiers." - Victim number two. And number three at the pyramids. - And the final verse is, um, "jungle wet with rain." Ugh, that could just be a hundred places. (phone ringing) - Shea. Yeah. Uh, yeah, I have Dr. John Richards. Why, what have you got? Mm-hm. All right, thanks a lot, appreciate it. - What did he say? - Well, Dr. Richards has had a very active passport. Probably traveling around a lot, researching his book. Including some cruise departures. - Oh. - I'm gonna call him in. - No! Don't do that. This guy wrote a book on women who disappeared, and he is a psychiatrist. He's just gonna be way ahead of you on the questioning. - Yeah, but we still gotta-- - Please, Tom. Let me talk to him, okay? Look, he's already asked me out to dinner. I can keep it really casual. He won't suspect anything. - I thought I was supposed to do the snooping. - Please. (sighs) - Susan, if it is him and he suspects that you know-- - I know. Believe me, I know. - Now, you see, that's much better. It's much better low. Thanks, guys. (phone ringing) This is Aidan. - Hi. - Susan, what a nice way to start the day. - I just wanted to thank you for the flowers. They're lovely. - Please, don't mention it. I'm sorry I missed you the other night. - Aidan, I don't know what your game is. I know that you have expressed an interest in Dee, and I am not interested in-- - Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Now, first of all, Dee was the one who called me and invited herself to the banquet. And second of all, we're not involved with one another. - No? - No. You know, honestly, she sounded quite needy. Lonely might be a more appropriate word. - Yeah, well, she's had a very tough time. Jack was the first relationship where she didn't do the leaving. - Susan, I am not Jack. And I'm not the kind of man to take advantage of Dee or to play games with you. Now, I would really love it if you could accompany me tomorrow night. - I, it's... All right. - Good. Pick you up at eight. - Bye. (sighs) (knocking on door) - Susan, I'm so sorry I'm late. - [Susan] That's all right. - Yesterday was one of my bad days. - [Susan] Oh. - Sometimes the chemo slows me down just a little. - Yeah. Sit down. Don't you think, Lois, we should reschedule your appointments for your home? - Nonsense. Watching the chauffeur trying to beat rush hour traffic tells me I can beat cancer. Who's the admirer? - Oh, it's a man called Aidan Masters. - The Masters Foundation? - Yeah. Do you know him? - Well, we are in the same business. You have excellent taste. - You know, this place looks more like a police precinct than a hospital ward. - I'm keeping a 'round-the-clock guard on your wife. - This is ridiculous. Okay, if you people are so sure that she was pushed, then why the hell aren't you out there trying to find the madman that did it? - We are. We're also making sure she's safe in case he tries again. - Oh my God! Oh baby, she's coming out of it. Oh baby. (mumbles) - Win. Win. - Who's Win? - I wish I knew. I wish I knew. - Okay, well, let's go to our next caller, who is Tiffany. Tiffany, hi. - Dr. Susan. Oh, I'm so glad I got you. - [Susan] I thought you said that you were going to bring me that ring. - I just can't. I mean, you know, in case Matt and I get back together. - You told me that Matt was a-- - A loser. Yeah, he is. But he's cute too. - Can you recall where you found the ring? It is very important. - Like I said, it was one of those dumpy Village shops. There was a fabric store across the street with some kind of elephant dude in the front window. - Elephant? - Yeah, I remember everything from that day. It was our first date. Matt and I were browsing, and I saw this classy-looking guy buying them. The owner said he bought a lot of them for all of his lady friends. - [Susan] Tiffany, do you think that you could recognize that man if you saw him again? - [Tiffany] Are you kidding? I'm a waitress. I never forget a face. My boss says he's never seen anything like it. It's part of what makes us the best Italian restaurant in Yonkers. (suspenseful music) - The cops get to you yet? They think that I pushed Carolyn in front of that van. It's unbelievable. - It's always about you, isn't it? You need attention, you're insecure. Even now, even now you're more worried about yourself than her. - She keeps calling for someone named Win. Do you know anything about that? - I think I might have an idea. Mr. Wells, I'm Dr. Susan Chancellor. Your wife, she called me just before the accident. - What can we do for you? - I'd like to see anything that she kept from her cruise. I'm looking for something about a man that she might have met aboard ship. - I think I can help you with that. She showed it to me on Sunday night. - I see you two have a lot of secrets. - Thanks. Did she have a ring like this one? - Oh my God! Yeah, I did a psychic reading on it. I know you probably think that's insane. - No. No, I absolutely believe in the kind of gift that you're talking about. - What did you see? - I mean, I couldn't really see it. I saw a woman's face. She was wrapped in plastic, and she was suffocating. - Could you see what the woman looked like? - No, the bag was all foggy, and she was gasping for air. - Okay. "See the marketplace in old Algiers." And then she's written a note. "Meet Owen, 1 p.m." - She's been trying to say Owen. The man from the cruise. (ominous music) (doorknob rattling) - Gimme the police. - I'm scoring zero. - Me too. Oh, here it is. Here it is. Henry Owen Young. So there was an Owen on the Abriela. With Carolyn but not Victoria. - He probably wouldn't travel under the same name, but he'll have two passports with the same face. I'll call the FBI, have 'em run a check. - So then all we have to do is match Henry Owen Young's passport photograph with the one from the cruise ship? - Even with the photos, we can't prove this guy killed anyone. - What about Tiffany? I mean, she said she could identify him. That would tie him to the rings. - All right, where does she work? - I don't know, she never said. She called it the best Italian place in Yonkers. - [Tom] That could be one of a hundred places.

I hope you don't think I was prying. - Not at all. You had an interesting career path too. When were you a cruise director? - It's how I financed my education. - Oh. Do you ever go back? I mean, to the ship as a passenger. - A couple of times. I still have a number of friends on the boat. - What exactly does a cruise director do? - Coordinate activities, make sure everybody was having a good time. - Keep the lonely hearts entertained? - It was good training. And like me, your own practice is helping people, lonely or otherwise, cope. - Were you successful in helping Jason Wells cope with his problems? - You know I can't discuss my patients. But yes, I think I was. - Do you think he had anything to do with what happened to his wife? - No. You? Good. Then we don't have to waste any more of our evening talking shop. When I started my practice, I didn't have much compassion for my patients. They were just problems to solve. - What changed? - My whole life. Alicia, my wife, called from an office party, said she would be home in an hour. I never saw her again. The first months were maddening, not knowing what happened, had she been killed, kidnapped? Had she run off with another man? - I thought you said she drowned. - The police found her car at the bottom of a lake near our home, and probably she'd missed the turn in the dark.

Goodnight, John. - Goodnight, Susan. (car engine running) (train rattling) (ominous music) (car door closing) - Oh my God, I was just, like, talking about you. No, no, no! (body thudding) (energetic music) (gun firing) (tires squealing) - It's obvious. Victoria, Carolyn, Hilda, Tiffany. It's gotta be the same guy. - We're putting a team together now. - Cream. What about the FBI check on Henry Owen Young? - No American passport issued in that name. If he's one of ours, he's traveling on a phony. - Sugar. That means he could come from anywhere. Everything depends on us finding a copy of Carolyn's cruise photograph. - And fast, too. Unless we get somewhere soon, some woman on an October cruise may be in big trouble. - Yuck. Tom, there could be a hundred cruises setting sail this time of year. - Well, we still have Jason Wells. - Ugh. - I mean motive, jealousy, abuse record. The guy fit the profile. - No! This is not the profile of a hot-headed husband. - Babe, we don't even have a profile. We have a series of murders that we're stretching to connect. - I know, we know, there is a connection. - Except the picture's not getting any clearer. Look, I got a souvenir storekeeper turned up dead in the Village last night. You want to try to connect him to this as well? - [Susan] A souvenir store in the Village? - Susan. Susan, it's across. - Can I help you? - Yeah, I'm here about the murder across the street. - Look, I already told the detectives everything I know. - Maybe you can take us through it again. (sighs) - Well, I should have checked when I saw his closed sign. He was a decent man. He deserved something better. - When's the last time you saw him? - When he put his sign out, I guess. - Did Abdul ever sell any rings like this one? - Yeah, sure. He was nuts for turquoise. - Did you ever see any of his customers? - Hey, hang out, all right, wait a minute, wait a minute. Yeah, yeah. There was a guy in the shop just before, yeah. But I didn't get a good look at him. - If we show you a photograph, do you think you could recognize him? - [Shopkeeper] Maybe. - What a great view! I love it! - You can see my townhouse from here. You probably already knew that, didn't you? - Ah, don't flatter yourself. (laughing) I think I'm gonna make an offer. I'm gonna tell 'em that I want to move in as soon as I get back from Panama. Have you ever been on a cruise? - No, I get seasick. - Aidan, thank you very much for all your help. - Dee. I know you're feeling lonely right now. - Care to show me the best lunch place in the neighborhood? - What are friends for? Come on. (door opening) - Douglas. - Are you sure you're up to talking? - Well, you said it was important. - Construction's ready to start in Guatemala. It's a state-of-the-art clinic for 400 kids. And the best part is. - Oh. It's as if Victoria's spirit's touching the lives of children. - This is why I wanted you to sign the papers. - I hope I haven't delayed too long. - Not at all. I'm flying to Guatemala in the morning. - Thank you, Douglas. You have made me very, very happy. - It was my pleasure. - Mr. Blake. Susan Chancellor. - Of course, how are you? - I'm fine, I was just going to speak with Lois. How is she doing? - If you have any new information on Victoria, I'd appreciate you running it past me first. - I think I'm quite capable of determining her emotional state. - Yeah, well, go easy on her today. She had a chemo treatment this morning. - Thank you for your advice. - [Lois] It's the new orphanage in Victoria's name. - It's beautiful. Lois, could Victoria have arranged to meet someone on that cruise? - What do you mean? - Maybe she would never have gotten involved with a stranger, but she could have agreed to meet someone that she already knew. - Victoria knew hundreds of people. - She wasn't seeing anyone special before the trip? - No, not that I knew of. - She never met a man by the name of Jason Wells, did she? He's an architect. - I know who he is. He designed the orphanage. - [Susan] Oh, it is a stunning work of art. - [Aidan] It's a lot like you. - You-- - Yeah. No arguments. The fact that I gave the artist the grant in the first place proves I have exceptional taste. (laughing) More champagne? - Yeah, I'd love some. - Ah. - What are these? - Those are the foundation's current projects. Actually, I'm going to Mexico in the next couple of days to open that hospital. - Is that a common design? - Absolutely not. Every single one of the foundation's projects are completely unique. - Would you excuse me, please, a minute? - [Aidan] Is there a problem? - No, I just, no. (cell phone beeping) Detective Shea, it's very important. - [Tom] Don't you ever take a break? - Do you remember I asked you to check out Douglas Blake? - Yeah. Ruggerio turned up a few things. Nothing too sinister. I mean, the guy's got a bit of a gambling problem. - What? - Yeah, he was into the Atlantic City boys for a lot of money four years ago but, I don't know, maybe that's why his law firm transferred him to Hong Kong. - Hong Kong? He was in Hong Kong? - Yeah, that's how we got the Victoria Clausen investigation. His firm worked for the mother, and he was right there. - Don't you find that suspicious? - Maybe. But his debts were paid, and if he still has a problem, it seems to be under control. - What if he paid off his debts with money that he embezzled from Lois Clausen? - Come again? - He told her he built an orphanage in Guatemala that I just found out doesn't exist. - All right, I'll send a car to pick him up. Call me later. (gasps) (ominous music) (phone ringing) (gasps) - Hello? (man breathing heavily) Is somebody there? Who is thi-- (dial tone buzzing) Lois. Lois, where is Douglas Blake? - Guatemala. He left early this morning. - Oh. Which is why the police couldn't find him last night. - Police? What's going on? (sighs) - Lois, the orphanage. It's a fake. The building belongs to the Masters Foundation. The police, they called Guatemala City this morning, and no one in their social services has ever heard of Douglas. Lois, I am so sorry. - Did Douglas have something to do with Victoria's disappearance? - He owed a great deal of money. Victoria could have been his ticket out. - He seemed so caring, so concerned. - Just the kind of man Victoria might have trusted. (alarm beeping) - Okay, doc, the security system works like a charm. - Thanks, Ernie. - Hey, listen, I saw your poster up here. You know, the Duprees version is the best. I mean, Dean Martin and Patti Page were good, but the Duprees version-- - Yeah, whatever you say. - Listen, I didn't know any of these other singers, though. - They're not singers, they're... It's related to verses. - What about this "jungle wet with rain"? - I don't know yet. - Well, you know, if that's what you're lookin' for, this'll get you there. My wife and I went there last fall, rained every day. I mean, you want wet jungle, that's where to find it. I'll see you later, doc. - [Susan] October's their rainy season. (phone beeping) - [Dee] Hi, this is Dee. Don't hold your breath waiting for me to call back. - Oh, Dee. Oh! (ominous music) - I've been worried about you. You haven't returned my calls. - I've been busy. - Have I alienated you in some way, Susan? - I told you, I've been busy. - How's the Clausen case going? - Is that the real reason that you're here? Tom! Dr. John Richards. John, this is Detective Tom Shea, NYPD. John was just leaving. Weren't you, John? - Nice to meet you, John. Nice coat. - Thanks. - What's up with him? - Oh, he just caught me off guard, that's all. - After you called about your breather last night, I ordered a complete check on everybody. Him too. Are you being careful like I asked you to? - Tom, listen. Dee is leaving Kennedy this morning to catch a cruise ship, and I can't get her on the phone. Do you know anyone that could? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll call the Port Authority police. She'll be fine, all right? What's important is these photos. Carolyn's photo will be here soon enough. I'd love to stay and help, but we got an APB out on your lawyer. He never went through customs. (jet engine roaring) - [Police Officer] Excuse me, miss? I've got a message for you here. Ah, yeah, there it is. Here you go. - Thank you. - [Police Officer] No problem. (sighs) (phone ringing) - Dr. Chancellor. - [Man] Just remember, darling, you belong to me. (lights slamming off) (gasps) (eerie music) (security system beeping) - [Aidan] Going someplace? - [Susan] Ah! (plastic rustling) (Aidan grunts) (phone ringing) - Had to keep poking your nose in, didn't you? Just couldn't leave well enough alone. - Aidan, Aidan, why are you doing this? - In psychiatric terms, I'm confronting my issues. Do you know what it's like to grow up in a family where money matters more than love? Huh? You meet someone who swears her love for you. Sweet little thing named Patty Owen. You Belong to Me becomes your song. She gives you a ring with the words carved right in there. She used to hum the song when we made love. Then you go on a cruise. We made love every night. And then you know what? She ditches you. She takes your money and she throws you away. - [Susan] No one threw you away. - Ah! I'm not falling for that trap anymore. And you know what? I met so many women just like her. They all pretend to be so lonely and so needy and so desperate for love. Victoria, Carolyn, Dee. Even you. But you fooled me, didn't you? Huh? - [Susan] Aidan, Aidan-- - [Aidan] I'm not gonna let you do what she did to me. - No, no, Aidan. Killing me is not gonna make things any better. - Shut up! (cries) Shut up. I've had enough of your psychobabble, Dr. Susan. You know what? This is my therapy. And it works just fine. All of this'll be over in about 10 minutes. And I'll tell you something. You didn't have to die, Susan. But you were getting too close. It'll all be over in 10 minutes. (pants) (throbbing music) - Guess where we found him? Catching a bus to Atlantic City. - You guys are all the same, huh? You never quit while you're ahead. (phone ringing) (grunts) (pants) (grunts) (glass shattering) (Susan grunts) - Hi. - I told you I'd be here. - [Dee] I haven't told a soul. - Good girl. - Although you did have me worried. (phone beeping) (busy signal beeping) - Hey doc, I heard you... God! Doc! Doc, doc. Doc, are you all right? Doc? (gasps) Are you all right? Hey, hey! - Tom, it's not him. It's not him. Masters. It's Aidan Masters. He's after Dee. - Are you okay? - Go, please, just go. Please. - I'll call an ambulance. Help her out. Help her out! - Susan! My God. It's over. Hey. (cries) - Okay, so who's Owen Black? - Somebody who's not gonna be hounded for grants and donations. - No chance of that where you're going. (police shouting) Get him outta here. - [Police Officer] Come on, let's go. Come on, move! ("You Belong to Me") - Baby. - It's okay. - It doesn't seem right, you in the hospital and me visiting. - They just wanted to make sure I was all right, that's all. Believe me, as soon as Dee's here with my clothes, I'm outta here. - Susan, it would take me a lifetime to thank you. And I don't have much of one left. But you've made the time that I do have much easier. - I wish I could have done more, Lois. - Knowing what happened to Victoria was hard. But not knowing was much harder. - Sorry I'm late. God, try getting in here after visiting hours. Luckily I had a doctor with me. - I'm glad you are feeling better. - Well, I'll get out of here and let you get changed. Thank you again. Would you mind helping me to the elevator? - Of course. See you. - [Dee] Bye. - Well, I better get going too. I've got a very long report to write. It was nice working with you again, Susan. - You too, Tom. And believe me, I am not gonna be a stranger. Tom? - Oh yeah, sorry. See ya. - Dr. Richards seems like a nice man. Do you think he can help me get over Jack? - Professionally or personally? - Professionally. Look, Suze, I want to thank you for saving me from Aidan. And I know that it's time I stopped using money to measure my happiness. Now, I can't say that I can change, but I will try. And the way he looked at you, I wouldn't stand a chance anyway. - Really? - Really. And I saw the way that you look at him too. I made that mistake once, Suze. I'm not gonna make it again. (Ernie clears throat) Come in, we're decent. - Doc, look at you. You look great! Don't tell me they're letting you out of here already. - Thanks to you, Ernie, it looks that way. - Oh. Hey listen, you're not planning on going back to the office, like, right away? - Ernie. - It's nothin', I'm sure we're not talkin' more than a couple of weeks. A week. Listen, doc, there are a lot of wires, and the instructions came in Korean, and-- - Ernie. - I'm on it, I'm on it. - Ernie! - Doc! ♪ When the dream appears ♪ You belong to me (energetic music)
