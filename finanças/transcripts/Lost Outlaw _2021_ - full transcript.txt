About what to do with the gold. You mean take it? Nah, nah, we're just gonna borrow it. Okay. Let's tell the others first. Quinn! Hold up! What is it? I don't see a posse around. Let me see how much we got. If you must. Not bad, but I wish it'd been more. I'll be takin' my cut right about now. You in a hurry? What are you worried about? You'll wait till we get to a safe spot. Look, Jack, I got plans with my cut. And Quinn? I don't think I'll be ridin' with you anymore. You got a better offer, Alfonso? Well, maybe Al doesn't trust us anymore. I told you not to call me that anymore, Jack. Now hand over my share. You want it, Al? You're gonna have to take it from my cold, dead hands. Come on! This is gettin' outta hand. You're not worth the bullet, Jack. Now, does anybody else wanna get their share now? Good. Let's keep movin'. Are you gonna keep puttin' up with Alfonso like this? My dear younger brother Red, don't worry about him. He won't be around much longer. You're probably right. Lucas! You comin'? Yeah. Be along in a minute. It's a good thing you backed down, Alfonso. What were you thinkin'? Shut up. Hold up, Quinn. I don't think I can put up with this guy much longer. I don't think we'll have to worry about Alfonso anymore. Well, you better hope not. All right, well, let's go find a place to bed down. What's the deal with Alfonso? I don't know what his problem is. Well, you brought him in. You better straighten him out or I will. Well, we need him right now. We're shorthanded. I mean, that's why we brought him and Lucas in. I'll have a talk with him. Well, you do that. He just better not cross me again. I said I'll talk to him. Yeah, Red, yeah. Talk is cheap, isn't it? What's goin' on? I don't know what's goin' on, but I don't like it. You mean with the brothers? Yeah. I don't trust 'em. Do you think they would cut us out? Now you're gettin' it. Come on. Let's get some rest. Wake up. Wake up! He went and did it. What are you talkin' about, Jack? Alfonso. He's gone. So's the money. What? You sure he ain't just walkin' about? Look, he's gone and so is the money. It just makes sense that he took it, huh? I can't believe he would do that. And leave the bag? Well, let's quit talkin' about it and go find that thief and get our money back. I still can't believe he'd do that to us. Well, you better believe it. I told you he'd be nothin' but trouble. Well, let's get movin'. No time to waste. Look. There's the guys. Yeah! Let's get us a drink first. Bartend? I'd love to have a beer. Make that two beers. You fellas know I can't serve you. Why not? You boys never have any money. Oh, well... Show me some money, I'll give you your beers. Fine. We'll be back with lots of money. And real soon. Yeah. Yeah we'll get our beers somewheres else. - Hmm! - Go ahead. Ennis? There is nowhere else. This hand is unbelievable. Hey there, fellers! What do you guys want? A beer. We ain't buyin' you any beer. Well, when you hear what we have to tell ya, you're gonna wanna buy us lots of beers. What could you possibly have to tell us that would be of any interest to us? There's gold down at the Chinese camp. That's right. We saw 'em find several nuggets. And we wanted to share our find with you guys. You best not be makin' this up just to get a free beer. No, no, no, no, no! Really! We didn't wanna leave our partners out. Maybe we should check this out for ourselves. Yeah, I had a lousy hand anyway. Yeah, I was gonna fold. I'm with ya. Oh! Eureka! Hey, fellas. You need anything else? Uh, well... No, no, we're fine. Um, thank you, really. All right, and you let me know if you do, hon. Finally. The gold! I don't know if I'll ever find a man as tough as me, Sarah. Well, maybe you need to soften up a little. Nah. That's when they take advantage. You'll find him someday, Sadie. What? Like Mom did? Just to have Dad split? She hasn't been the same since. He had his problems, but not all men are like that. How do you know? There's no decent men around here. I read the Bible. There are godly men who love their women. Yeah, I know you read the Bible a lot. Well, good luck finding a godly man around here. We'd better get home, get these supplies back. Mom's gonna be worried. Well, hello, Sadie, Sarah. Hi! How's things? Hey, Ennis. What's all the hurry about? Have you seen Sal? No, we haven't. Why? Uh, well, he got ahead of me and I'm tryin' to catch up to him. What are you two up to? Oh, a little of this, a little of that. You know, I got big things to do. Well, gotta go. Bye! That boy sure is touched in the head. Maybe so. Or he's coverin' up somethin'. Sure acted strange. Yeah. Stranger than a possum in heat. Okay, Sadie. You sure have a way of puttin' things. Alfonso! Alfonso! Well, I think we've looked for him long enough on foot. Agreed. We can find the scum tomorrow. Can we go into town already and have some fun? Well, we could all use a break. I'm just not sure we should all show up at town together. We are wanted brothers, remember? Well, why don't we send Lucas into town. See if they have a bank. Check it out. That's a good idea. They won't be lookin' for one stranger. You okay with that, Lucas? Yeah, sure. I guess. Just what do you want me to do? We need to score some money, Lucas, either from a bank or a saloon. Check and see if they have a sheriff. You know? That sorta thing? Well, why don't you stop at the saloon and see if they got any pretty girls in there? Will do my best, Red. All right, well, let's get back to camp, and you can go to town from there. Yes sir. I won't let you down. You best not, Lucas. Hey there! How's it goin'? Any luck? No, no. Not really. Oh yeah? That's not what we heard! Times are hard! What you want? Everything! We want everything! We got nothing! Trust me! No, no, no, no! Don't hurt him! - Give us the gold. - Leave him alone! Gladly. Just give us the nuggets you found. Nuggets? Don't have any! Please! Don't hurt him! I'm afraid your friend may die if you don't tell us the truth. - Now! - Please! Don't tell. I'm not afraid to die. No! It not worth it! Here! Take them! Why, thank you. I knew it! Let's kill 'em! Now, now, let's not be so hasty. Is that all of it? Just give it to him! I swear. We not do well. Looks like you're doing very well to me. Thanks. Let him go. It's your lucky day, Chinaman. Now go on, get, before ya die!

Well, as the new owner of Lilly's Tavern, I feel I need to say a couple things. I just love the new name you picked. It does have a nice ring to it, Ellie. Doesn't it, Farb? Why, it surely does, Clementine. All right, all right, all right. That's all fine and dandy. Now listen. We need more business. I need you all to try harder to get more customers. Well, we are doin' our best, Miss Lilly. Yeah. And I appreciate that, but girls, really, we could be a bit more friendlier with the men once they get in here and start drinkin'. Yeah, that way I could do some more pourin'. You got it. And I guess I could do a little less slappin'. Great idea. So we all agree then? - Yeah. - Friendlier, more pourin', and less slappin'. Great! Let's get to work. All right. Howdy. Is this here a ghost town? Seems like it sometimes. Where is everyone? Well, this time of day they're either workin' the mines or the ranches. What can I get you, stranger? Whiskey. So. You here on business? Just passing through. Actually, I am looking for someone. Really? Friend or foe? Friend. He's about 5'10", 180 pounds, brown hair. Usually clean-shaven. Either a Mexican or Italian look to him. We get a lotta folks through here that could look like that. Some Mexican, but mostly Chinese. Okay. Well, I guess I'm just gonna have to keep on lookin'. - Thanks. - Aw, don't mention it. Another shot? - Sure. - Oh, good choice, cowboy. One more. Stay right where you is, mister. Marshal Daniels. It's been a while. Yes it has, Tate. Too long, I suppose. 'Cause years ago, I don't think you woulda let me sneak up on you like this. True, but then again, maybe I knew you were there all along. So what you doin' out here? Are you huntin' or are you bounty huntin'? Bounty. Three brothers. Bad brothers. The Red Jack Gang. Oh my. Well, you sure got your hands full with those boys. I'm well aware of that. What brings you out this way? I was on the trail of a horse thief named Blackwell. But maybe I could be of some service to you. I'll keep that in mind. I'm gonna visit some of the mining camps and ask around before I head into town. You gonna be there? Yes sir, the plan is to be in Angel's Camp by nightfall and buy you the first round. Thanks, but I don't drink. Well, maybe a sarsaparilla if they have that. Sure thing. Sarsaparilla it is. You be safe out here, old friend. Will do. You too. Glad you girls are back. Was startin' to worry. Oh, Mama, we can take care of ourselves. Oh, did you get the spices I asked for? Sure thing. Got 'em all. Good, good, good, because I've invited someone to join us for dinner. You have? Hmm. I wonder who that could be. I think it's Mr. Tucker. She's got her eyes on him. Ha ha, very funny. Mr. Tucker happens to be a gentleman and a dear friend. We know, Mama. We just like to tease you about him. It is kinda fun. Glad he'll be joining us. I do like to hear his stories of when he was a lawman. Well, he is retired now, so don't bug him about it too much. Oh, we won't. For sure. Cute. Listen, put the horses away and come in and help me get dinner ready. Anything for you, Mom. I really hope Lucas finds somethin' good to loot. I hate bein' broke! Yeah, me too, Red. Yeah, well, if you hadn't brought that no-good Alfonso into the gang, we wouldn't be in this fix now, would we? Don't blame me! He ain't never done nothin' like this before. Well, let's not go around blamin' each other, okay? It was Alfonso that did this to us. When we find him we'll get to the bottom of it. Yeah, if we find him. He's probably long gone by now. You know, you shoulda let me go into town with Lucas. I don't think I can trust him anymore either. You know we can't go into town together. We're too recognizable. I mean, there's probably a posse out for us already. I just wish there was some way of knowin'. Aw, you can bet that either the Pinkertons, marshals, or bounty hunters are gonna be on our tail soon enough with all the robbin' and killin' we been doin'. Well, we need money, and we need money soon. Bartender? Who's that man that just left? Well, I never seen him before, but he was in here askin' if I had seen his friend. Who's that? I don't know that either, mister. Hmm. Hey, Daniels. Barkeep? Lemme have a beer. Certainly, Marshal. For you, sir? - I'll have- - My friend here will have himself a sarsaparilla, if you please. That'll be just fine. Well. Any luck? Did you find any clues on your outlaws? No, not really. I ran into some miners down by a camp about five miles outta town, but they hadn't seen any strangers. Yeah, those Chinese don't say much at all. Only a few of 'em can even speak English. Chinese? These men were not Chinese. They were white men. And they were very standoffish. That mining creek about five miles out of town? Yes, that's right. Well, that's odd, because that's been a Chinese mine in the area for a long time now. They lease that land over there. Well, that does sound odd. Could it be a different creek in another area? Possibly. I'll check back by that way later. Maybe tomorrow. Hey, I'm still here. I'm still willin' to help. I appreciate that. Marshal Daniels! It is good to see you. Good to see you too, Tucker. Who's your friend? Oh, this here is Mr. Tate. He's a bounty hunter. - Nice to meet you, Mr. Tate. - Hello. Are you on the tail of anybody I might know? Not sure. You know of the Red Jack Gang? Wanted in three states. No, no, I can't say I do. They do sound nefarious though. That they are. Well, good luck to ya. Hope you find 'em soon. Well, Sheriff, how are you enjoying retirement? Very well. Thank you for asking. Huntin' and fishin. Although tonight I'm havin' dinner with three women. Well! Now that sounds invitin'. And fine women they are, too. Aw, their old-time friends. Single mom and her two daughters. I'm sure you will eat well. Always do when I'm at Kate's house. Well, I hope to run into you fellas soon. It's good to see you, Marshal. Always good to see you, my friend. Yup. Nice to meet you, Mr. Tate. Yeah, likewise. Hold it! Oh, it's you. You shouldn't sneak up on us like that. Yeah, you're liable to get your head shot off! Sorry. Wasn't trying to wake you. Not much goin' on in town. Pretty quiet, really. Hey, where's Jack? I don't know. He was here when we bedded down. Go see if his horse is there. I don't see it. I bet you he's in town right now! He's been itchin' for a woman and a drink. Yeah, but with what money? This ain't good. Let's head out and look. Maybe we can catch him before he does somethin' stupid. Jim, would you like to lead us in grace? I certainly would. Should we hold hands? Oh, Father, we are grateful for this well-cooked food. Please bless it as we enjoy good conversation. Amen. Amen. Well, that was short and sweet. Well, we don't want the food to get cold, do we? No sir, not on account of me bein' so hungry and all. Miss Kate, you are by far the best cook in the West. Well, thank you, kind sir. It does make me glad to see you so happy. Yeah, especially since you don't have a wife to cook for you anymore. Sadie, do you even think before you speak? I didn't mean any harm. No, no, no, it's all right. Really. Maggie's been gone for a couple years now. Can't say I'm used to it, but... Well, thank you for opening your home and for your friendship to me. It has helped immensely. It's our pleasure. Sadie, please try to be more sensitive. Yes ma'am. You know we're here for you, Jim. I'm sure you must miss her terribly, as well as being a lawman. Well, I'm content being retired, and it really helps knowing she's in a better place. Did they ever catch the bank robbers? Not that I know of. So sad she was in the bank at that time. Oh my gosh, girls! Please! Let Jim enjoy his dinner. Would you like some more bread? Um, sure. I can see you're lookin' for trouble, mister. No trouble from me, miss. I'm just lookin' for a little fun. Mmm. Now, why don't you fetch me another drink and we'll see just how much fun we can have. Alrighty, darlin'. That no-good cad. I can't believe this. I think maybe you and I should go inside and have a little talk with him. Lucas? Now you stay out here and keep watch, in case things get ugly. Yes sir. I got your back. All right. Thank you. Mmm. I can't tell you how good it feels to have a smooth drink and a warm woman by my side. It's been way too long. Well, darlin', you treat me right, I'll treat you right. Oh, not just yet, honey. Well, well, well, boys. Glad you could make it. Now we can have some real fun. What in the blazes are you doin' here? Just trying to have some fun, brother. With whose money? Is there a problem? Nah, just a little family matter. Miss? You're gonna have to leave. He's not causin' any trouble over here. Besides, he promised me some money for a good time. Another time, miss. Fine! Where'd you get the money, Jack? I don't have any money, little brother. Now leave me alone. What do we have here? Where'd you get this? What did you do with Alfonso? Hey, settle down. We don't want any trouble here. That's all right. We were just leavin'. Let's go. Come on! You been drinkin'! And you didn't tell us that you were comin' to town. I needed this, Quinn, and I knew you wouldn't approve. You must've lied to us about Alfonso. Did you kill him? No! I swear I didn't. I just ran him off that night. He was gonna take all the money. And I couldn't let him do that. Well, you shoulda told us you had the money. I know. I'm sorry, I just... Listen, I don't know who I can trust anymore. Besides, I only took a little. You only care about yourself! You upset, Redmond? I told you, don't call me that. The good thing is we still have some money left. I can make it up to you. How? When I was in the bar I heard these miners talkin' about some gold that was found nearby. Then there's the saloon girl, and she tells me where it's at. So I figure if we take it from the Chinese, we can be rich. How do we know you ain't makin' this up just to save your skin? I'm not makin' it up, Red. Well, we are family, you know? For now we're just gonna have to believe him. Let's get him back to camp and we'll straighten it out in the morning. Come on. Get up! Well, well, well. What do we have here? Looks like some white miners where there should be some Chinese miners workin'. It seems they took advantage before we got the chance. Well, we'll see about that. But we have to be smart about it. Come on! Hyah! Come on. Gentlemen! It's your lucky day. We're here to help you with your gold panning. We don't need any help. We sure don't! Who do you think you are, anyway? Well, I think we're the Red Jack Gang. Now, isn't that right, brother? Yes, brother, you are correct. Well, I think it's best that you lay down your tools and your guns while we talk. Why should we do what you say? Because we're your new bosses and we aim to run this camp. And we don't take kindly to gangs that mistreat the Chinese. Now, we came across this spot fair and square. Jack! Stop it! You gonna just shoot these unarmed men? Well, the thought had crossed my mind. Why? Because that is murder in cold blood. These men could be of use to us. All right, fine. Now, you two. You have a choice. You wanna run? Or you wanna stay and work for us? Who, us? Yeah, of course we wanna stay and work! Yeah! We didn't like those guys in the first place! When do we start? Now. Get back to work. These fools seem like idiots. Could be an advantage for us. Well, that's strange. Sarah! Sadie! - Yeah, Ma? - Did you hear gunshots? No. I didn't hear anything. Maybe it was hunters. Well, I just heard a lot of gunshots and they didn't all sound like rifles. Well, not everybody hits their mark the first time like I do. That's true. Good thing you're modest about it too. Hey, can we go inside now? Fine, go ahead. It just makes me wonder. Well, hello there, gentlemen. Here are your iced teas. Why, thank you, Miss Annie. Appreciate that. - How are you? - Great. How are you? Very well, thank you. What about yourself? I am just fine. Thank you for asking. So what will it be, boys? I believe I'll have some of your delicious pot roast again. Sounds good. Well, that's a wonderful choice, but I am gonna go with the venison. All right. Comin' right up. - Thank you, Annie. - Thank you, ma'am. So what's your plan to catch this gang? Well, I am pretty sure that they came this direction, and I would assume that they must be holed up somewhere nearby, needin' supplies and all. Do you know what they all look like? No sir. Only two of the brothers, but I would expect there would be more men with 'em. So I it'd be a good idea if we take notice of any strangers in camp. I think it's unlikely they would come into town themselves for supplies. Maybe I could be of some help you, Marshal. The sheriff's gone. He had to take care of that prisoner transfer. Well, sure thing, but only if you feel up to it. Oh, I feel up to it just fine. I may be retired, but I'm not completely out to pasture. To old times. To old times, my friend. Hey, Sal? What do you think of our new bosses? I think they are ruthless killers. I wouldn't go tellin' them that! I wouldn't do a thing like that! You think we should run for help? No, no! We gotta make 'em think we're okay with this. Frankly, I don't know how much longer they'll keep us around. You don't think they would... You know, kill us, do you? Maybe. But not if we can make ourselves more valuable to 'em. I got this gold tooth! Shh! Ennis! If I were you I'd keep that one to yourself. When the time's right, we will have our chance to escape. Okay. Okay. Good talk, Sal! Good talk. Mama, Sarah! Could you get out here, please? What do you want, mister? How can we help you, sir? Let me introduce myself. My name's Tate. I'm not hear to alarm anyone, just letting you know that I'm looking for a gang of outlaws. Well there aren't any here, sir. Nope. Keep movin' on, then. Sadie! I'm sorry, Mr. Tate. We are Christian women, but my daughters seem to have forgot their manners. It's quite understandable. A stranger riding up can be unnerving. Just want to know if you've seen any strangers. Just you. Three brothers and possibly two more robbed a train earlier, and I am to bring them in dead or alive. I haven't seen any. Sarah? Not recently. Sadie? Don't recall, actually. All right, then. Thank you for your time. Please be careful. Alert the local law if you see anyone suspicious. We will do, Mr. Tate. Thank you. Have a good day, ladies. Well, I suggest we heed the man's warning. Come inside, girls. Got anything to eat around here? Sal, Ennis! Get over here! Uh, oh, oh, yes, sir? You two got anything to eat? Well, not much, I'm afraid. No, not much. We haven't been to the supply store in a while. Lucas. Why don't you take Ennis here with you into town and get some fresh supplies. Go ahead and take Alfonso's horse. - He can ride that one. - All right. You can ride him, right? - Yep. - All right. Listen, we only got a little money left. Spend it wisely, okay? Get goin'. All right, Ennis. Let's go. Uh, well... Sure. Sal, get back to work. - Stay put. - Yes sir. Well, our money ain't gonna last very long, Quinn. We gotta find some gold real soon. Or a stagecoach nearby. Well, we might have to, thanks to you. Let's just keep it together for now, huh? So, you know what they're gonna need? Yeah. Mostly chew. Jerky. Maybe some corn and bread. Don't know if we have enough for whiskey. You a big drinker? No, but Jack is. I guess it's just as well if we don't get him any. You don't like him much. I don't think I can trust him now. Still wonder what happened to Alfonso. Who's that? Don't worry yourself about that. Let's ride. Ah! Oh! Oh my goodness! Oh, no! No, no, no! Oh my! Oh! Oh my, oh my! No, no, no! Oh! Oh my goodness! My, my... Oh, you can't, no- - Hey! - No! What's the matter with you? Too much killing! Too much! - Too much death! - What's goin' on? Too much killing! Too, too- - I don't know. Maybe he got bit by a rattlesnake or somethin'. Over there! Get outta the way. Get outta the way! There's a dead body over there! - Hey, calm down now. Stop it. - Too much! Too much! It's Alfonso! What? Who coulda done this? Well, don't look at me. I had nothin' to do with it. I didn't need to see this! It's just awful! So what are we gonna do now? Well, we're gonna have to bury him. We can't afford to have the law find him. Red, check his pockets for money. He ain't got nothin'. I bet somebody killed him and robbed him and took our money. Maybe. We don't know for sure. Yet. What are you lookin' at? Get him outta there. So what brings you here to these parts? Oh, um, just seeking new adventures and possible jobs with my friends. Oh, yeah? What kind of work you do? You know, a little of this and that. Mostly sodbustin' and cattle rustlin'. Does it pay much? No, not really. I would like to see how good that gold mining is. That's where the real money's at. Yeah. Gold is the best. That is, if you can find it. Yes. My partners are determined to do just that. Seems like that's all they talk about. Never having enough money. Will do anything for it. Even robbin' and killing. Are you up for that? I'm not gonna lie, I done some bad things to get it. Even killed a couple men that got in the way of it. But I'm sick of it. Well, maybe you need a change. Somethin' better. Yeah. Maybe. Wonder what that's about? I don't know. Let's go see. Whoa. Whoa, whoa. That's far enough there, fellas. Hey, Dame Sadie, it's just me. Ennis? Why, I hardly recognized you. Why you ridin' up on me like that? We heard gunshots. I was just practicin'. And who might you be? Howdy there, ma'am. Ma'am? Do I look a ma'am to you? Uh, no, I just- - He a friend of yours, Ennis? Uh, yeah. Uh, he's new in these parts. Well, that's true. I've not seen you around here. Yeah. This is Lucas. Lucas, huh? And what's your story? Me and Lucas here's gonna go into town for supplies. Supplies? For what? You workin' again, Ennis? Yeah. Yeah, sort of. I thought I'd try my luck at, uh, mining. Pretty good shootin'. For a girl, that is. What do you mean, for a girl? I hope you know I'm the best shot around these parts. Maybe even the whole territory. Well, you are standing pretty close to the target there. Let me show you. Whoo-hoo-hoo-whee! That's some shootin'! Not bad for a little ol' girl, now is it? No. Not bad at all. Well, it was fun and all, but we gotta get back to work now. Yeah, we gotta hurry up and get them supplies like we were told to. Y'all always do what you're told to? Yes ma'am. Always. And what about you? It depends. Good day, ma'am. Depends? Depends on what? The one who's telling. Howdy, Miss Sarah! Howdy, Ennis. Refills, gentlemen? - Yes, please. - Yes, please. Thank you. Ma'am, this is probably the best coffee I have had in a long time. Well, thank you kindly, Mr. Daniels. Oh, yes, Miss Kate makes the best coffee in the West. - Thank you, Jim. - Mm-hmm. I'm just pondering here, but you have you noticed any strangers in the area lately? No. No, I have not. Actually, I did recently hear a lotta gunshots coming from down by the river. The girls thought it was just hunters, but I can't imagine what they were shooting down there. Unless it was fish. I never tried fishing like that, but I guess you don't know about some of those drunk miners. Well, has anybody rode down there to check it out? No, I haven't been down there in a long time. No, you know, it's really just the Chinese miners, and they don't bother anyone. Nah, it's probably nothin' to worry about. Miss Kate, your girls are comin' home. Marshal, you and I had better leave. We've taken up enough of Miss Kate's hospitality. Well, thank you, ma'am, for the visit and for that fine cup of coffee. You're very welcome. Come back soon. Hey, next time maybe for supper. Oh! That would be wonderful. She's also the best cook in the West. Oh, thank you, Jim. - Bye now. - Bye-bye. - Hey, girls. - Hi, Mama. - Thank you, Sadie. - Thank you. Hey, Mama? Who was that man with Mr. Tucker? Said his name's Daniels. He's an old friend of Jim's. What did they want? Oh, they just came by for a visit. Oh, they did ask me if I'd seen any new strangers roundabout. Strangers? Yeah, why? Have you seen any? Well, sort of. There was somebody with Ennis. They came up on me while I was target shooting. Well, what did he look like? I don't know, he was tall. Muscular. Kinda handsome, right, Sarah? I don't know, maybe. Somewhat. Well, what were they up to? Said they were going to town for supplies. Ennis, with a stranger, going for supplies? Yep. They were told to. By who? I'm not sure. Ennis was acting a little nervous. Ennis doesn't go anywhere without Sal. This is strange. Did they say anything else? Well, Ennis said he was trying his luck at mining gold. Course, he acted like he wasn't supposed to tell me that. You didn't tell me any of that. Well, I didn't think much of it. They were more interested in my shooting anyway. I am a good shot, you know. Yes, we know. Still... This is getting more strange by the minute. I wish you coulda said this to Tucker and Daniels when they were here. They'll be back, won't they? Are you really worried, Mom? Well, yeah, they'll be back, and I am a little concerned about Ennis with this strange man. Did you happen to hear what his name is? Uh, Lucas. Yeah, he said his name was Lucas. You want me to ride down there tomorrow, Ma, and check things out? No, no, not alone, anyway. You know what? Let's wait till the sheriff gets back to town. I think that's best. Good idea, Mom. Better to be safe than risk our own necks. Yeah. I guess. What is it? Yep, Sarah and Sadie sure are purty, ain't they? You could say that. Isn't that what I just did? Aren't you listenin' to me? Yeah, pretty. They're pretty. Let's get back to the task at hand and get the things we came here for. Okay, okay. You don't have to get sore at me. I'm just talkin' like I always talk. Sal says I talk too much. Sometimes I need to get to my point and I just don't. I know what he means. I just try to get somewheres. I just don't get noplace. Stop your worrying and talking and let's get the supplies that we came here for and get back. Okay. Hey, Red! Come here a minute. Yeah? Now, we gotta bury this body. Now take him over there where we put the others. And take a shovel, bury him deep. Wait a minute. Why don't we just let Lucas and that other guy do it? I hate workin' on an empty stomach! I know you hate... Look, I'm having enough trouble with your brother Jack, all right? I don't need it from you too. All right, I'll do it. Good. Sal! Get over here! And grab that shovel too. Jack should be doin' this. This just ain't right! Here you go, boss. One shovel. That's ain't my job. That's your job. Help me with the body. Okay. Well, can I say a few words over him after we're done? - No! - No? You know what? I don't care. Do whatever you want, all right? Just help me grab him. Okay, boss! Quit callin' me boss! You got everything? Yup. Then let's get goin'. Don't want nobody mad at us. ♪ Lost outlaw, lost outlaw ♪ ♪ Is my destiny to live and die alone ♪ ♪ Lost outlaw, lost outlaw ♪ ♪ I take what I'm not given ♪ ♪ For it's all I've ever known ♪ This creek's a bust. There ain't no gold here! He's right. This is gettin' old and I'm not used to this kinda work. I understand your frustration, Jack. You know, but you're the one that led us here. Yeah, well, it was based on a hunch from what I was told. We need a train or a bank or somethin'. You know, Sal doesn't need to know our business, all right? Somethin's gonna turn up. Just be patient. 'Bout time you two got back. Yeah, what too you so long? I'm starvin'! Well, I got just about everything you wanted. Me too! Hey, fellas! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Didn't mean to sneak up on y'all. Just wondering how the pannin' was goin'. Hiya, Sadie! Nice to see ya! Yeah, we're good. Thanks. Sal? What are you doin' down here? Say, Lucas? Who are your friends? You know this woman? Well, yeah. I mean, sort of. We met at the trail. Miss. This here is Pete and Sam and Henry. Nice to meet y'all. Say, Ennis? Where are the Chinese? Where's Soo-Li? Chinese? Uh, Sen-Lu, Sen-Li? Uh... I don't know. What he means is they had to leave and we're not really sure when they're comin' back. Oh, no. Really? What happened? Um, it was a family emergency. They asked us to keep an eye over things and these fine gentlemen here, they came to, uh, volunteered to help us out and we exchange it for food. Is that right? Why, ma'am, yes it is. We were lookin' for a homestead and we just happened upon these fine fellows here. Ennis? Is that what happened? Why, yes, Sadie. Uh... No foolin'! Sadie? It's startin' to get late. Mom and I are beginnin' to worry. Everything's fine here. I was just leavin' anyway. Thought you might try comin' out here on your own. Should get goin'. Looks like Sal and Ennis got it under control. We'll see ya later, guys. Ladies, please, allow me to escort you. Oh, you don't have to bother, really. It'll be my pleasure. All right, then. Thank you. You know, that Sadie, she's a pretty filly, but... She acted like she owned the place. - She does! - Ennis! Well, her mother, Kate, and sister too. Why are you telling 'em that? Hush! Well, they would've found out anyway! Oh! Well, thank you, Ennis. That's some very valuable information there. What are you gonna do? You're not gonna hurt her, are you? Not if we don't have to. You think Lucas is gonna make it back to camp tonight? Would you? You're right, I wouldn't either. Now, Ennis, you are gonna tell us where the women live. Aren't you, Ennis? It sure smells good in here. Good. I hope you're hungry. Oh, yes. Good morning. Hope you slept okay. Why, yes, I did. Thanks. Anything's better than that cold, hard ground. I really appreciate you letting me stay the night. It's our pleasure. Now please have a seat. Sadie! It's time for breakfast. Wow, this looks so good. Have not had a home-cooked meal in forever. Well, you should have one more often. I'm starvin'. Let's eat! Hold on, Sadie. You know we need to say grace first. I don't. Well, I do. Let's hold hands. Lord, for this meal we are about to partake in we are truly grateful. Please protect our home, our family, and our new friend Lucas. - Amen. - Amen. Let's eat. So, Lucas, what are your plans for today? Oh, not too much. I should head back down the camp here soon with my friends. Oh, really? So soon? Hey, if he's gotta go, he's gotta go. Well, I was kinda hopin' he could go to church with us this morning. What for? - Sadie. - Sorry. Church? I, uh, never really thought much about going. It's really fun. We sing and read the Bible, and being today's the first Sunday of the month we have a potluck afterward. It's pretty special for our small community, the picnic, and some people bring guitars and fiddles. Hey, if he doesn't wanna go, don't bug him about it. She's not buggin' me, Sadie. Actually, it would be a nice change from those smelly old men down at the river. Great, then. It's settled. I'm gonna finish getting ready. Oh, great. You've made her so happy. Stop. Actually, Lucas, you know what? I'm sure my ex-husband has some clothes in the closet that would probably fit you. They might be a little big, but they'd work for church. If it's not too much trouble. It's no trouble at all. Now go ahead, eat your fill. ♪ Shall we gather at the river ♪ ♪ Where bright angel feet have trod ♪ ♪ With its crystal stream forever ♪ ♪ Flowing by the throne of God ♪ ♪ Yes, we'll gather at the river ♪ ♪ The beautiful, the beautiful river ♪ ♪ Gather with the saints at the river ♪ ♪ That flows by the throne of God ♪ Pastor. Well, thank you for that beautiful song. I'm sure the Lord will be pleased with that. If you have your Bibles, you'll wanna turn in 'em with me to the book of Job. One time a gypsy was reading the Bible and he came to the book of Job, he thought it said job and he put it down. Humor, folks. But I'm sure most of you are familiar with the story of Job, a man that was very prosperous, feared God, very successful, but he lost it all. He lost his farm and livelihood. A hurricane came in and destroyed the house, killed his 10 children all at one time. He had seven boys and three daughters. He got deathly sick. Had boils all over his body, extremely painful, and if that wasn't enough, his wife came up to him, said, "Curse God," and died and left him. He lost everything. And in the middle of all that, speaking of God, Job said, "Yea, though He slay me, yet will I trust Him." Amen. Yes. And God restored everything back to Job. Everything, double. Doubled everything. And I know we all go through hard times. There's no one exempt. Everyone has difficulties in life. I doubt any of us had the pain and the grief that Job experienced, but we've all had tough times. There might be someone here this morning who's in the middle of a storm right now. You know, God can come through. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. - Amen. - He loves you. He has a plan for your life. He wants to restore your life and make somethin' out of it. You just have to trust Him. Where is your faith right now? Where is your faith today? Can you trust God? He's waiting. He's waiting for you with open arms. Would you come to Him? Let's pray. Well, howdy, ma'am. Hello. How can I help you? We're just here for a little social visit, miss. Yeah, well, now's not a really good time. I'm cleanin'. Oh, well, we don't wanna cause any trouble. We're actually here to speak with your mother. Is she home? No, she's not here right now. She's at church. I'll let her know you came by. Now, you wouldn't mind if we just came inside and waited for her, would ya? I mean, if you don't mind. We could really go for a freshly brewed cup of coffee. Well... I guess you could come in for a little while. Mm-hmm. I want to welcome you to our church picnic this afternoon. I'm so glad you could make it. You know, God gave us a beautiful day today and now we get to enjoy some good fellowship and food. Shall we pray? Hats, gentlemen. Father God, we thank you for this day, for family and friends. We thank you for our health. And Lord, we just pray you bless the fellowship and bless the food today. In your glorious name we pray, amen. Enjoy, folks. You enjoying your food, Lucas? Why, yes. It is quite good. Good, I'm glad. So tell me, what'd you think of the sermon? The sermon? It was a little short, but effective. Oh, yes. Pastor doesn't like to give a long sermon when he knows there's food waiting. Howdy, ma'am. Howdy. Ma'am. Wonder if you'd mind to introduce us to your compadre. Of course. This here is Lucas. Hello, sirs. Howdy. I'm Marshal Daniels. This here is Mr. Tate. You from around here, Lucas? Mr. Tate here is checkin' out all the new faces in town. Why is that? Well, if you must know, I'm on the manhunt for some lowlife thieves and killers. Oh, my. Surely you don't think Lucas here has anything to do with that? Well, we're just checkin' out the new folks in town to see if they may, ah, notice any unscrupulous characters around. Well, no. No, I haven't. I've been traveling about, looking for work. Mostly alone, really. Why so serious? Come on, we're supposed to be having fun today. Oh, we are, Mom, really. These gentlemen here just had a few questions for our new friend Lucas. What kinda questions? Well, we're just checkin' the new faces in town because of the, uh, the gang of brothers that may be nearby. Ah, of course. Oh, nonsense. This is not the time nor the place for that. I'll tell you what, why don't you guys come out to my house a little later and we'll all get acquainted? Yes, gentlemen. Why don't we head over to Miss Kate's house and relax? What do you think, Tate? Yeah. Sure. Be along in a while. You two comin' along as well? We'll be along presently. Okay, Lucas? Sure. See you soon. I wonder what they wanted from you. Don't know. Probably just being cautious of strangers. I'm curious, though, why didn't you tell them about the guys you've been working with? I didn't think it was the right time. And they did catch me off guard a little bit. Those men are harmless for the most part. For the most part? Tell me, are you harmless for the most part? Of course. I mean... I have done some things in the past that I'm not proud of. But I would never hurt you. Or your family. Well, that's good to know. I sure hope not. I tell you the truth, Sarah. That pastor made me think about my life today. What about your life? That's just it. I don't have much of one. That Job guy had everything and lost it all and still had faith in God. Sounds like you're ready for a change. I think so. I am tired of the way things are. And the men that I run with. Well, let me tell you, God has never let me down, and he'll be there for you as well. I like to believe that. Maybe I can learn from you. Absolutely. I'd love to help you. God is love, and that's the first thing you need to understand. Hey, let's get going and we'll talk more on the way. Okay. Sounds good. - Thank you, Sarah. - Mm-hmm. I can't believe I'm stuck here babysittin' you two while my brothers are out in town where all the women are at! Don't let us keep you here, Red. Go join 'em if you want. Yeah, we're fine! What possible trouble can we get into? Nah, nah, I better stay put. Quinn wanted me to keep an eye on things, so that's what I better do. All right, suit yourself. Doesn't really make any difference to us. ♪♪ We'll be comin' around the mountain ♪ ♪ We'll be comin' around the mountain ♪ ♪ We'll be comin' around the mountain when she comes ♪ ♪ She'll be comin' around the mountain ♪ ♪ She'll be comin' around the mountain ♪ ♪ We'll be comin' ♪ Ennis!

You're welcome. Why don't you go ahead and have a seat, Jim, - and I'll put some coffee on. - All right. - Mama! - Sadie! Everybody relax. No one'll get hurt. Have a seat. Sir. What did you do to her? Nothing, ma'am, I assure you. At least let me take the scarf out of her mouth. Uh-uh-uh! I'll do that. What do you men want here? Hush up. We'll get to that. Are you okay, Sadie? What happened? Yeah, Mom, I'm fine. Except for these two bullies came in uninvited, marched their way inside the house, wanted to talk to you, and then they tied me up when they heard you comin'. That's not entirely true, ma'am. We asked if we could come in and wait for you. She let us in willingly. And that is true. She was just fine until we tried to tie her up and then she hits me in the stomach. And I'm still feelin' that. You're quite the little rascal, aren't ya? Yeah, you bet I am. And I'll do more if you touch me again. All right, all right. Let's just take it easy, okay? We don't wanna cause any trouble. We just felt like we had to control the situation, and we're new in the area, okay? And we didn't know how you would handle it. What are you men doin' here? What do you want? I told you to be quiet. Now, now, brother, that's no way to talk to our new neighbors. Sir, we been down at the creek helpin' the Chinese pan for gold. Mom, I was down there. There's no Chinese down there, including Soo-Li. Sal and Ennis said they had to leave because of an emergency. And now I have my doubts about that. You went down there alone? Well, yeah. Sarah came down lookin' for me. I was gonna tell ya. She did go down to the river. But why would your friends lie to you? Well, maybe they were forced to. Ma'am, we came here with a proposition for you, okay? Now, you own the land down by the creek, correct? Why, yeah. Why? Well, we weren't sure before, but now that we know for sure, we'd like to purchase it from you. You came in here forcibly with guns drawn to make a purchase? Shut up! It doesn't matter, Jim. The land is not for sale. Oh, that is disappointing, ma'am. Ma'am? - Do you have any playing cards? - Why? Yeah, well, I thought before we left we'd play a little friendly game of poker. Go ahead, Mom. Anything to get them to leave. What you up to, brother? Oh, don't worry. You'll see. Here. All right, thank you very kindly. Have a seat, ma'am. We're playing for the highest card. Winner gets the deed to the property. You must be joking. I'm not going along with that. Hey, it's a 50/50 chance. Aces are high. If you like, I'll give you a different card off the top of the deck, if you don't trust me. Don't do it, Mom. I'm not. We'll just see what happens. Oh! A deuce, what a shame. Well, I'll tell you what. I'll give you another chance, okay? I'm not touching it. Here you go. Oh! A ten! Not too bad. But I'm feelin' lucky today, Jack. Let's take a look at my card. Oh, ace of spades! I win. This whole thing is a farce! Oh! Now stay down! No! Leave him alone! Just takin' a little nap. Course, his jaw's gonna be killin' him when he wakes up. It was a fair card game. Leave her alone. It's okay, Sadie. Now, that wasn't very hospitable of you, ma'am. Why don't I just hold this for you while you go get the deed? Why, thank you kindly, ma'am. Now, if you'll just sign it over to me, we'll be on our way. What name do I put on it? Just sign your name that you turn it over to me and I'll sign it as the new owner. Thank you. What's wrong? I'm sad. Why? 'Cause I told them men that Kate's family owned this land and where the women lived. Yeah, I know. But frankly, I was surprised you did it. I couldn't help it! It just come out! I wouldn't want anything to happen to 'em! Well, let's go warn 'em, then. Aren't we supposed to stay here? Who's gonna stop us, Ennis? I don't know. No one! Now come on, let's get goin' so we can catch up to Red and hopefully do somethin' to save the ladies! I'm so glad you came today. Me as well. Not what I'm used to. How do you like our little town and countryside? Very nice. Beats living on the trail. You think you'll keep working with the miners? Not sure. Don't know, but I need a change. Maybe you can find something to do around here. Possibly. What would I do? Anything you want. You seem like a smart man. Thanks. Well, I am good with horses. Whoa. And guns. Well, maybe the blacksmith needs help shoeing horses. Maybe. Sounds like you want me to stick around. Well, to be honest, I've never met anyone like you before, so yes, yes I would. Ma'am? Are you sure you don't have a little whiskey in this place? I would not keep a drop of the devil's poison anywhere near myself nor my family. Brother, you're gonna have plenty of time to drink whiskey later. Why don't you two vermin get outta here? We will. Just as soon as you promise not to go to the law. Right. So what's it gonna be? Fine. We won't go. Mama! Don't give up so easily. I won't agree. Honey, there's nothing we can do. Please don't give these men any reason to hurt you. Well, those are wise words comin' from a wise mom. Okay, Mama. I'll do it for you. But not for them. What about you? Fine. I'm gonna take your word for it for now. You expecting company, ma'am? Why, yes, I am. Well, you coulda told me. Well, you didn't ask. Two riders approachin'. One looks like Tate. I say we shoot 'em. No! Don't hurt 'em! Shh! Quiet! Look! You all wanna live? You keep it down, you understand me? Now, you're gonna have to come out here with me and pretend like we're friends, all right? And Jack? If that is Tate out there, he hasn't seen me yet. If things go wrong, you know what to do. Understood, brother. Let's go. Hello, gentlemen. Hello! I'm sorry that we're late. It's okay. Change of plans, actually. I had a friend stop by. Oh, really? Who's your friend? This is, uh... Pete, sir. I'm an old friend of hers. Oh, hello. Well, is it all right if we come on in? No! No. I'm sorry. Now's just really not a good time. We've got some stuff going on, so maybe we could get together tomorrow instead. Is everything all right, ma'am? Yes, yes! Everything's fine. Actually we were just going over some business arrangements. - Right, Kate? - Yes. Yes, we were. Are. We are. Yeah, she's finally ready to sell that land down by the creek. Oh, really? Well, seems that would be worth quite a lot. Uh, you would think so, but you know, the gold's pretty much gone down there now and I just don't wanna have to mess with it anymore, so- - Well, she's getting a really good deal. Shall we get back inside and finalize things, Kate? Yes, yes, sure. Okay, gentlemen, I guess we'll see you again real soon? All right, then. We'll see you soon. Ma'am. Pete. Till we meet again. What'd you make of that? Strange. I thought she was nervous. Yeah, so did I. Let's ride out a ways out of sight, swing around and come back. Agreed. Jim was supposed to be here too. Well, we don't know who all's in there. But Miss Kate could be in some trouble. Well, that was real good, Kate. Did what I had to, nothing more. Now go sit down. These two were pussycats, fortunately for them. Well, we'll go ahead and leave after we know that the law is gone. What are we gonna do with them? Eh, nothin' for the moment. They've seen what we look like. They're just not gonna forget us or what we've done. Well, we gotta keep our options open. I mean, we can sell the land, and if we have to, we'll take care of them later. But I do think we're gonna have to take one of 'em with us to keep them honest. Kate. Do you know somewhere we can hide out? I know a place. The Lord knows the way. Watch our back. You got it, Quinn. Hey! There's Quinn and Jack! - And they have Kate! - Shh! Looks like they're headed towards town. Well, what do you think they want with her? I don't know, but we should follow and see what's goin' on. She might need our help. Could we borrow some horses? - No. - My feet are killin' me. Nah, nah, nah, nah. We gotta move quick! It's not time for horses. Oh, yeah! Right! You're pretty smart, Sal. Sometimes I wish I wasn't. Life would be easier. Hey, I take life easy! Yeah, this is true. Come on, we gotta go. Anybody home? Help! We need help in here! Help us! Come in here! - We're in here! - Help! Come in here, we're helpless! Untie us! Oh-ho my! What do we have here? Untie me right now! Come on, relax. One at a time! What's your name, honey? My name's Sadie, it's not honey! Oh, yeah. You came down to the camp. - Yeah. - Well, the call me Red. What's goin' on here? Your brothers took my mama and they tied us up. Well, they must've had a good reason. No, no good reason at all! Now untie us! I'm not sure that's such a good idea. What's your side of the story? She's tellin' the truth. Your brothers forced her mama to sign over her deed to the river land. The river where we were minin'? Yeah, that's the one. They're crooks, and now they're kidnappers too. Those are some mighty big accusations, little lady. And the fact that you're both still alive means things can't be as bad as you tell it. Well, they are. And if you don't help us you're as guilty as they are! They can't just run around tyin' up innocent people! Why, sir, you don't seem to know us at all. That's just how we do it. You're part of the gang the law's after! Pray tell, who may that be? You'll find out soon enough. Yeah, the marshal and the bounty hunter are gonna arrest you all, and then you're gonna hang. That's no way to talk to a guest, honey. Hey! Stop that, leave her alone! You in the house! The is the United States Marshal! Come out with your hands up! I told you they were comin' for ya. Shut up. We know you're in there! Leave that family alone and come out peacefully! You men better move on! If not, these two are gonna get hurt! There's only one man! He calls himself Red! Shut up! Come on, honey, you're comin' with me. Now, don't fight it. Come on! Let's go. I know you're out here! I got the girl! Don't shoot! Don't you move one inch! Hold on, filly! - Let me go! - Don't! I want him to feel my pain. Sadie, Sadie, it's okay. We've got him now. That's right, miss. Hello, Red. Long time. Not long enough. Tate, Daniels, it is good to see you men. Things were gettin' uncomfortable in there. Yes sir. We figured there was somethin' not right so we decided to play a little possum. We rode out, swung around and come back. And we're glad you did. They took my mom. We gotta help her. Do you know where they would go? Well, I overheard them sayin' they'd wanna take her someplace we wouldn't expect. Not the mining camp. No, I do not think so. Wait a minute. The last thing Kate said was, "The Lord knows the way." "The Lord knows the way." The church! There's nobody there now. I think it's a good possibility that's where she'd take 'em. All right, you, let's go. Good day, gentlemen. Sadie? What's going on? Sarah, I'm so glad you weren't here. It was awful. Why? What happened? This man's brothers, they held us hostage. They took the deed to Mom's creek and they kidnapped her. Oh my goodness. That is horrible! Was anyone hurt? No, no. We're all okay. Worried about Kate, though. And he's one of them. Is that so? Well, I have been working with them. But I am not a part of this. Absolutely not. Lucas was with me at church, remember? Oh, you're just sweet on him. How do you know you can trust him? I just can, Sadie. I can't explain it right now, but we've been talking and he wants a real change in his life. Even so, ma'am, you're gonna come with me. I wanna take you to the jail for some questioning. Tate? Tucker? I will meet you both at the church after I get through with these two. Do not attempt to move in without me. All right, but he's still my bounty. Yes sir. No! Please don't! Lucas is different, honest. It's okay, Sarah. I'll be fine. I can understand their concern. Everything's gonna be okay. You'll see. Really, Sarah. Everything is gonna be just fine. But you gals better stay here. I guess so. I'll go get my gun. Traitor. Wait till my brothers hear about this. I think you should be worrying about your future right now, Red. Shut up, both of you. Let's go. Here you go. I assume you still know how to use one. Well, it's been a while, but I bet I remember. Thanks. Lord, forgive these men and show them your way to live a better life. Why did you bring us here? So you could pray? Excuse me, ma'am, but I don't need your prayers, thanks. I brought you here because the church is empty this afternoon and this evening after today's activities. Oh, I see. Very good, Kate. You're a smart woman. Unless she brought us here as a trap. What's the plan now, Quinn? Well, it's up to Kate how this plays out. How's that? Well, I mean, we find that we're not really cut out for mining or settling in one place. Now, and I'm not ready for hard labor, either. Yeah, I know that. So I'm thinkin' first thing in the morning we go to the land office and the bank and you tell 'em that you gave us the deed but you changed your mind and you wanna buy it back from us. No! I don't have the money, even if I wanted to. Besides, you took the deed unfairly. He won it fair and square. Well, it doesn't really matter now, does it, Kate? I mean, all we want is our money, and then we'll be out of your lives for good. You expect me to stay here with you all night while my daughters are home alone? What if they come looking for me? Well, they best not. Especially if they know what we can do to them. What if I cry for help? Help! Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey! Now, we have not been violent so far, but if you don't care about yourself, you should care about your daughters. Anybody notice? I don't know. I don't hear anything. Keep listening. As I told you, Marshal, I am no longer associated with the brothers. And you're willing to testify against them? Yes, I am. You traitor! Wait till my brothers find out about this! Would you hush up? Now, listen. I need to get over to that church. You need to get in this cell. With him? You heard what he said. He wants me dead. Let me come with you. No, that is not the way this plays out. I could be of help. I know how these men think. I imagine you do. All right. But you'll go without your guns. I understand. But I still wanna help. You're gonna die, Lucas! Would you hush up? Now, when I bring your brothers in you can complain to them all you want! In the meantime I suggest you hush. Did you hear that? Sounds like horses. Oh, please, Lord, let it be Tate and Daniels. Shut up, woman. You better check it out. I got it, brother. Quinn! Get out here, help me! Put the gun down and we stop shooting! You're not takin' me alive. Hold it or the woman gets it in the head. You're not gonna do that. Now you let her go, now! Well, we got a problem then. You're the one with the problem! You are surrounded! Give it up! Lucas, do somethin'! Sorry, Marshal, but we gotta go. No! I thought you were different! Sorry to disappoint you, ma'am. Come on, brothers! It looks like the shootin's over with, Sal. Yeah, I think you're right, Ennis. Looks like we missed the good stuff. Well, if we'd gotten the horses- - Well, I know, I know. There just weren't time. Ennis? Ennis? What? You can take the mask off now, you know. Maybe we should leave 'em on for a little while. There's maybe still some outlaws around. Nah, nah, there's nobody here. Well, looks like our work here is done. I'm sure Kate's just fine, buddy. You think we should go look? Nah, nah. We'd probably just be in the way. You know, you're probably right, Sal. You're so smart! Sometimes it's a burden. Guess I'm just stuck with it, though. You're such a good friend, Sal. You too, Ennis. You know, friendship's the best. Yeah, if you can find it! So what do we do next? Well, I was thinkin' maybe we could see about lookin' to round up some... The gold! I am so happy you're all here today. Jim, would you please lead us in prayer? Certainly. Dear Jesus, thank you for another day of life. Thank you for food and company and for freedom from evil. Yes. And changed life. Amen. Amen. Come on, dig in, everyone. I'm starvin'. I want to thank you, Jim, Lucas, and of course Sadie, for saving Mom yesterday. Everyone was so courageous. Thank God He heard our prayers. And we heard the church bell. That was perfect. How did you think of that? Well, I wanted to help and I don't like guns, so... Well, it was perfect timing. And a smart thing to do. Thank you, but I must say you did have us worried when you took Daniels' gun. Yeah, I was shocked. Why did you do that? Well, I had to make the brothers think that I was on their side. Well, that worked out well. Sure did. I actually had you in my sights for a moment. I didn't know that you were there. But I don't think that you would've shot me. Haven't I grown on you yet? Well, kinda. As long as you're good to my sister. But I would've shot you if it meant to save Mama. But you did save me, and I will never tell you not to target practice again. You are still the best shot. Tucker? Do you think that the men will recover and serve time or be hanged? Well, Quinn wasn't badly injured. Jack was, but the doc seems to think he'll recover well enough to serve jail time or be hanged. That's up to the judge. But Tate, he wants his reward money either way. Well, I must say, I'm glad no one had to die. Especially you, Lucas. I'm glad you weren't badly hurt. And it's never to late for someone to change for the best. Isn't that right? Amen to that. Hey, Mama? You think the Chinese will want to come back to the mining camp? I hope so. We need to get word to their family that it's safe to return. Yeah. I just want things back to normal. There's been a lot of craziness goin' on around here lately. Sarah? Can we step outside for a minute? Certainly. Mom, will you excuse us? Yes. Ooh! Stop. So what's on my hero's mind? I just gotta tell you that yesterday, when I saw you ringing that bell, I knew that I was doing the right thing by turning on the brothers. You mean you almost didn't? Well, I didn't know exactly what I was gonna do, until I saw your mother in trouble. I felt like, for the first time in my life, God was on my side. Well, you said everything was gonna be okay, and it was. I'm so glad you did the right thing. Well, I'm gonna keep doin' the right thing. With God's help and yours. So does that mean you're gonna stick around? Yes, of course. I think that I'm falling for you, Sarah. Oh, I'm certainly falling for you too, Lucas. Whoo-whoo! - My sister. - Who else?
