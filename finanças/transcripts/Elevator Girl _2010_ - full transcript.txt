I'M, UH, JONATHAN MACINTYRE. HI, JONATHAN. I'M LIBERTY TAYLOR. MOST PEOPLE JUST CALL ME LIBERTY, OR LIBBY, I MEAN. [laughing] SORRY. LIBERTY? THAT'S A, UH, UNIQUE NAME. YEAH. MY MOM THOUGHT IT WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, A GOOD WAY TO REMIND ME THROUGHOUT MY LIFE THAT I COULD BE AND DO WHATEVER I WANT, ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE, YOU KNOW, THAT KIND OF THING. WELL, THAT'S A GOOD MESSAGE FROM A MOM. YEAH, I THINK SO. I MEAN, YOU'D MAKE A-A GREAT DEFENSE ATTORNEY. YOUR NAME ALONE WOULD INSPIRE A LOT OF HOPE IN YOUR CLIENTS. OH, IS THAT WHAT YOU DO? UH, YEAH, ATTORNEY, YES, BUT, UH, DEFENSE, NO. OH. I MAINLY DO CORPORATE LAW-- MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS. BASICALLY, IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO BUY SOMETHING OR SELL SOMETHING OR MERGE A COMPANY, I'M THE GUY WHO MAKES SURE THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING BY THE BOOKS. OH. OH, THAT-- THAT, UH... THAT SOUNDS REALLY INTERESTING. DOES IT? [laughing] YES. YOU DON'T REALLY THINK SO. IT'S OKAY. I'M SORRY. I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE. NO, NO, DON'T APOLOGIZE. IT'S FINE. IT'S, UM... IT'S REFRESHING ACTUALLY. I'M, UH-- I'M USED TO PEOPLE TELLING ME WHAT I WANT TO HEAR, OR WHAT THEY THINK I WANT TO HEAR, ANYWAY. YOUR HONESTY IS A NICE CHANGE OF PACE. WELL, OKAY, IN THAT CASE, THEN, UH... YOUR JOB PRETTY MUCH SOUNDS LIKE A CURE FOR INSOMNIA. both: [laughing] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HOPE YOU'LL BE PATIENT JUST A LITTLE BIT LONGER. WE ARE SO SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE. OUR VALETS ARE HAPPY TO CARRY LUGGAGE IF ANYONE WOULD CARE TO TAKE THE STAIRS UP TO YOUR ROOMS. FRANK? SO DID YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE A LAWYER? NO, ACTUALLY. UM, GROWING UP, I WANTED TO BE A RACE-CAR DRIVER. [chuckles] BUT, OF COURSE, THAT WASN'T A VERY PRACTICAL GOAL FOR THE MAN OF THE HOUSE, SO I-I RECONSIDERED. OH, YOU'RE MARRIED? ME? NO. OH, NO. NO, WHEN I SAID MAN OF THE HOUSE, I MEANT WHEN I WAS A KID, UM... OH, RIGHT. MY FATHER PASSED AWAY WHEN I WAS YOUNG, AND MY MOTHER RAISED ME BY HERSELF, SO... OH, I'M SORRY. WOW, THAT IS-- THAT'S A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR A LITTLE KID. I, UH... SCHOOL WAS ALWAYS REALLY EASY FOR ME, AND WHEN I REALIZED NOT ONLY COULD I GET THE JOBS AND SCHOLARSHIPS I WANTED, BUT THAT I HAD TO, YOU KNOW, TO HELP OUT MY MOTHER... AND I'M SORRY. I... [laughs] I NEVER TALK ABOUT MYSELF LIKE THIS. I'M RAMBLING. NO. NO, YOU'RE SHARING ABOUT YOUR LIFE, AND IT'S INTERESTING. SO, UH, WHAT ABOUT YOU? I WAS RAISED BY A SINGLE MOM TOO. UM, MY PARENTS SPLIT UP WHEN I WAS LITTLE. I WASN'T THAT INTO SCHOOL, THOUGH, NOT LIKE YOU. I WAS MORE INTO THE EXTRACURRICULARS. OH, SUCH AS? WELL, I, UM... I TOOK ALL KINDS OF DANCE. I DID A SEMESTER OF ULTIMATE FRISBEE. I HAD A FAILED ATTEMPT ON THE SOCCER TEAM, AND I FINALLY REALIZED I REALLY WASN'T THAT ATHLETIC, SO I MOVED ON TO MUSIC, WHERE I PLAYED THE FLUTE, I PLAYED THE SAX. I TOOK ALL KINDS OF ART CLASSES. WOW. YOU MUST BE REALLY CREATIVE. I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, I LIKE TO THINK SO, YEAH. BUT I'M SURE YOU ARE, TOO. I MEAN, YOUR JOB JUST TAKES A DIFFERENT KIND OF CREATIVITY. [laughs] I'M SURE THERE'S AN ARTIST IN THERE SOMEWHERE JUST DYING TO COME OUT. - WELL... - WHAT? OKAY, I-- IT MIGHT BE THE, UH, FRUSTRATED RACE-CAR DRIVER IN ME, BUT... OH, COME ON. SPILL. I KINDA LIKE TO, UH-- I LIKE TO PAINT MODEL CARS. - [laughs] - YEAH. YEAH, IT'S KIND OF STUPID. I KNOW. NO. NO, IT'S NOT STUPID. I MEAN, ART'S IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER, RIGHT? YEAH. RIGHT. I LIKE THAT. YEAH. WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHAT'S YOUR-- YOUR NEXT CREATIVE OUTLET? WELL, HONESTLY, I'M EIGHT CREDITS AWAY FROM FINISHING CULINARY SCHOOL, AND IF I WOULD JUST GO AND FINISH-- I DON'T KNOW, I FEEL LIKE I NEVER HAVE TIME. WELL, IT'S GREAT, THOUGH. I CAN'T COOK A THING. WHEN I'M WORKING, I EAT OUT, AND WHEN I'M HOME, I MICROWAVE ALL MY FOOD, SO... OH, THAT'S TERRIBLE. COOKING IS FUN. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, I CAN MESS UP TOAST. [sighs] SHOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH LONGER, RIGHT? I MEAN-- OH, YOUR-- YOUR TIE IS A MESS. - OH, SORRY. - OH, SORRY. DO YOU WANT ME TO FIX IT? YES. YEAH. THANK YOU. THERE. YOU'RE PERFECT. WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I'D SAY PERFECT. I MEAN, I STILL CAN'T COOK, RIGHT? RIGHT. YOU KNOW, OF COURSE, IF I'M GONNA LEARN HOW TO COOK, I... I MEAN, I PROBABLY NEED SOMEONE TO TEACH ME. DO YOU KNOW ANYONE THAT COULD DO THAT OR... HMM... MAYBE. - YEAH? I'LL HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT. [loud thud] - OH! [elevator running] - UM... - I'M SORRY. OH, I'M SORRY. WOW. SO THIS WAS, UH... THIS WAS FUN, ACTUALLY, BEING TRAPPED IN AN ELEVATOR WITH YOU. YEAH, IT WAS. WE SHOULD DO IT AGAIN ONE TIME. I MEAN, WITHOUT THE ELEVATOR, OF COURSE. RIGHT, OF COURSE. MAYBE A COOKING LESSON. YEAH, A COOKING LESSON, THAT WOULD BE NICE. ALL RIGHT, WELL, UM, I'LL SEE YOU AROUND. OKAY. BYE. JONATHAN. - ALAN. - YOU MADE IT. - HOW ARE YOU? - LET'S GET YOU A DRINK. YEAH. EVERYTHING GOING OKAY? - YEAH, FINE. THANK YOU. - GOOD. WE ARE HERE TONIGHT TO TALK ABOUT A YOUNG MAN WHO I AM VERY EXCITED ABOUT AND FEEL JUST PRIVILEGED TO HAVE, UH, IN THE FOUR WALLS OF OUR ORGANIZATION. THIS YOUNG MAN HAS MADE HIS ASCENT IN THIS FIRM SEEM PRACTICALLY EFFORTLESS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TONIGHT, WHEN HE WAS HARSHLY OVERRULED BY A POWERLESS ELEVATOR AS HE WAS TRYING TO COME UP TO THE DINNER. [laughter] SO I WELCOME HIM AS A NEW PARTNER. I THANK ALL OF YOU FOR COMING TONIGHT. I HOPE YOU WILL ENJOY YOURSELVES. AND WITHOUT ME STANDING HERE AND PUMPING YOUR HEAD ANY BIGGER THAN IT ALREADY IS, SO THAT YOU'LL ASK FOR MORE MONEY, I GIVE YOU, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, JONATHAN MACINTYRE.

I'D LIKE TO THANK THE FOUNDING PARTNERS FOR WELCOMING ME AS AN EQUAL TO THE FIRM THAT THEY HELPED BUILD FROM THE GROUND UP. UH, NOW, ALL YOUR NAMES ARE AT THE TOP OF THE LETTERHEAD. I KNOW THAT. I WON'T FORGET THAT ANYTIME SOON. UM, BUT I WILL NOW, AS A PARTNER, CONTINUE TO REPRESENT SHUSTER, BARRON & CLYDE, THE INDIVIDUALS AND THE FIRM, TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITIES. ALAN, RICHARD, GRACE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS AMAZING OPPORTUNITY, THIS WONDERFUL DINNER. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE AND SHARING THIS WITH ME. IT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

I BET YOU WERE AT THE TOP OF YOUR CLASS, RIGHT? RAKING IN THE SCHOLARSHIPS, LAW REVIEW. I KNEW IT. AND NOW THAT WE'VE BOTH ACHIEVED SO MUCH, IT'S LIKE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GO OUT AND GET THE REST OF IT-- YOU KNOW, MARRIAGE, KIDS, DOG RUNNING AROUND THE BACKYARD, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHO HAS THE TIME FOR IT. OH. WELL, I CERTAINLY DON'T. I MEAN, THE ONLY WOMAN I TALK TO ON A DAILY BASIS IS MY SECRETARY, AND SHE'S OLD ENOUGH TO BE MY MOM. WELL, I'M, UH, PROBABLY A TRAITOR TO MY GENDER, BUT I NEVER REALLY BELIEVED IN ALL THE FAIRY-TALE ROMANCE STUFF THEY FED US AS KIDS. IT'S FUNNY. I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THAT THE OTHER DAY. YEAH, RIGHT? I MEAN, WE BOTH WORKED HARD TO GET INTO THE RIGHT SCHOOLS, TO GET THE RIGHT DEGREE, THE RIGHT JOB, YOU KNOW, THE RIGHT HOUSE AND CARS AND ALL THAT. I THINK A RELATIONSHIP SHOULD BE APPROACHED THE SAME WAY. YOU MEET THE RIGHT PERSON, AND YOU WORK AT IT. YEAH. A RELATIONSHIP IS A PARTNERSHIP AS WELL. AND, REALLY, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU MET SOMEONE AND FELT SOME IMMEDIATE LIGHTNING-BOLT CONNECTION? SO... WHAT'S UP? - I MET A GUY. - WHAT? WE GOT STUCK IN THE ELEVATOR ON THE WAY TO THE CATERING EVENT. THE POWER WENT OUT. - OKAY. TELL, TELL! THAT'S THE THING. I DON'T KNOW. HE WAS SO, LIKE, SWEET AND CHARMING IN THE ELEVATOR, AND THEN HE JUST TOTALLY IGNORED ME AT THE DINNER. HE WAS REALLY RUDE. OKAY, WAIT, WAIT. SO HE WAS AT THE DINNER WHERE YOU WERE SERVING? YEAH. HE WAS THE GUEST OF HONOR. HE JUST MADE PARTNER AT HIS LAW FIRM. LIBBY, THAT'S IT. HE'S GOT A SNOOTY JOB. THEY DON'T TALK TO "THE HELP," YOU KNOW? AT LEAST NOT IN FRONT OF THEIR SNOOTY FRIENDS. I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, YES, HE WAS DEFINITELY A BUTTONED-UP KIND OF GUY, BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT HIM. HE WAS SWEET. I DON'T KNOW, LIB. IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT YOU WERE PUT ON THAT ELEVATOR, AND IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT IT GOT STUCK. THERE IS A REASON. AND WHAT REASON IS THAT? I DON'T KNOW. [laughing] WELL, THAT'S SO HELPFUL. THANK YOU. OKAY, ALL RIGHT, UM, MAYBE YOU WERE PUT ON THAT ELEVATOR WITH THAT GUY THAT NIGHT TO LEARN A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF. OR MAYBE THE LESSON WASN'T YOURS TO LEARN. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHO KNOWS? MAYBE GRUMPY MCGRUMPERTON WENT HOME THAT NIGHT AND LEARNED A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT HIS RUDE BEHAVIOR FROM YOUR SHINING EXAMPLE. [car horns honking] HOW WAS YOUR DATE? CYNTHIA-- SHE'S NICE. I LIKE HER. UM, SHE'S ATTRACTIVE, AND YOU WERE RIGHT. WE HAD A LOT IN COMMON. OKAY, SO YOU WEREN'T BLOWN AWAY. ALL RIGHT, BUT TAKE HER OUT ON A SECOND DATE, LIKE A REAL DATE. YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO DINNER, TAKE HER TO THE MOVIES. IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S ANYONE ELSE YOU'RE INTERESTED IN. IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE YOU'RE INTERESTED IN? DUDE, DO NOT HOLD OUT ON ME. I MIGHT HAVE MET SOMEONE AT THE PARTNERSHIP DINNER. HER NAME'S LIBBY. THERE WERE NO SINGLE CHICKS AT YOUR PARTNERSHIP DINNER. NO, ACTUALLY, WE, UH... WE GOT STUCK IN THE ELEVATOR TOGETHER ON THE WAY UP. SO DID YOU ASK HER OUT? UH, NO, NOT EXACTLY. UM, SHE'S A CULINARY STUDENT, SO... I DON'T KNOW, I MIGHT HAVE ASKED FOR A COOKING LESSON. SMOOTH. NICE. BUT WHEN WE GOT OFF, IT TURNS OUT SHE WAS A...A WAITRESS FOR THE DINNER. JONATHAN, BUDDY... COME ON. FORGET ABOUT ELEVATOR GIRL, OKAY? BECAUSE YOU JUST BECAME PARTNER AT ONE OF THE LARGEST LAW FIRMS ON THE WEST COAST. YOU'RE NOT DATING A WAITRESS. YOUR BOSSES ARE YOUR PEERS NOW, MAN. I MEAN, YOU GOT TO BE SOCIALIZING WITH THEM, AND WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF GIRL ON YOUR ARM, YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO? - HMM? YOU SHOULD HOST YOUR OWN DINNER PARTY. I MEAN, YOU'RE ONE OF THEM NOW, MAN. HUH? YEAH, I GUESS. ROSIE! JONATHAN'S GONNA HOST A LITTLE, UH, DINNER THING AT HIS PLACE. OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU SHOULD INVITE CYNTHIA, MAKE IT A SECOND DATE. I'LL BRING KATHERINE. - YEAH. OKAY, BUDDY. GOOD IDEA. ALL RIGHT, WELL, I WILL LEAVE YOU TO IT. THANK YOU. I ASSUME YOU'LL NEED A CATERER. YES. JONATHAN, I COULDN'T HELP BUT OVERHEAR. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO ASK THIS CYNTHIA WOMAN? I MEAN, SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU HIT IT OFF WITH SOMEONE ELSE. I MEAN, I SHOULD SEE CYNTHIA AGAIN. YOU KNOW, AND BESIDES, THE OTHER WOMAN... I, UH... I SCREWED THAT UP. YOU KNOW, I WAS JUST-- I WAS SO SURPRISED THAT SHE WAS ACTUALLY WORKING AT THE DINNER. YOU KNOW, I... I JUST FELT WEIRD TALKING TO HER. I WAS KIND OF RUDE.

ROSEMARY, I HAVE A LOT OF GOOD THINGS IN MY LIFE, OKAY? YOU INCLUDED. BUT EVERYTHING GOOD IN YOUR LIFE, YOU'VE HAD TO WORK FOR. IT'D BE NICE IF SOMEBODY WAS JUST THERE FOR YOU, BESIDES ME, OF COURSE. I WOULD LIKE THAT. BUT I LIKE TO WORK. I ALWAYS HAVE. SOMETIMES I JUST THINK THAT'S WHAT MY LIFE IS ABOUT. JONATHAN, I KNOW IT FEELS THAT WAY NOW, BUT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS IN LIFE BESIDES WORK. [Libby laughs] WOW, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL. WELL, WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT WE GOT PLANNED. THANK YOU. - ENJOY. APPRECIATE IT. YOU READY? - YES. - OKAY. MMM! THIS FOOD IS DELICIOUS. MM. WELL, I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE IT. SO HAVE YOU ALWAYS LIVED HERE? UH, NO. I GREW UP ON THE EAST COAST, ACTUALLY. I STUDIED LAW, WENT TO A VERY PREPPY SCHOOL THERE. - REALLY? - YEAH. MY MOM THOUGHT IT'D BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME. UM, OF COURSE, SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO WEAR THE BLAZER AND TIE TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY, BUT, YOU KNOW, SHE WAS RIGHT. IN THE END, IT SERVED ME WELL. WHAT ABOUT YOU? DID YOU-- DID YOU GROW UP HERE OR GO TO COLLEGE HERE? NO, DIDN'T DO THE COLLEGE THING. I KIND OF TOOK MORE OF THE LIFE-EXPERIENCE ROUTE. I TRAVELED A LOT. I WENT TO EUROPE. I TOOK A SCULPTING CLASS IN ITALY. I WORKED AT A PIZZERIA THERE, AND I LEARNED HOW TO TOSS THE DOUGH. [laughs] YEAH. UM, I WORKED AT A FARM IN THE SOUTH OF FRANCE AND LEARNED HOW TO MAKE GOAT CHEESE. GOAT CHEESE. I LOVE GOAT CHEESE. YEAH. ME TOO. I SKETCHED THE ROOFTOPS IN SANTORINI. I LIVED ON THE BEACH IN AUSTRALIA, WAITED TABLES THERE AT THE BEACH AND LEARNED HOW TO SURF. THEN I KIND OF FINISHED IT ALL UP WITH AN ACTUAL VACATION IN HAWAII. AND THEN I CAME HOME. THAT'S AMAZING. WOW. WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER A WORLD TOUR LIKE THAT? I WENT TO MASSAGE SCHOOL. THAT MAKES SENSE-- CHEESE, SURFING, PAINTING, MASSAGE SCHOOL. UM, AND NOW YOU'RE BACK TO FINISH CULINARY SCHOOL. - YES. - OKAY. YES, AND, HOPEFULLY, I WILL GRADUATE AND GET A JOB, I MEAN, IF I CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY PUT IN THIS SAUCE, UM, I'M PRETTY SURE IT'LL ALL BE WORTH IT. WELL, TO NEW ADVENTURES, THEN. CHEERS. SO, UH, YOU KNOW, BEING A RACE-CAR DRIVER WASN'T LOOKED ON BY MY MOTHER AS BEING VERY PRACTICAL. SHE WANTED ME TO BE A DOCTOR OR A LAWYER. I CHOSE THE LATTER, AND, YOU KNOW, FORTUNATELY, I, UH... I PASSED THE BAR BEFORE SHE DIED. I'M SURE SHE WAS VERY PROUD. SO WHAT ABOUT YOU? WELL, WE MOVED AROUND A LOT WHEN I WAS A KID, SO THAT MEANT A NEW SCHOOL EVERY YEAR OR TWO. I BECAME VERY GOOD AT MAKING FRIENDS. I MEAN, I COULD TALK TO ANYBODY. [laughs] WELL, YEAH, THAT'S OBVIOUS. YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT IT. ARE YOU SAYING I'M TALKING YOUR EAR OFF? NO, NO. NO, I'M JUST SAYING, UM... [laughs] I'M SORRY. YOU KNOW, AS A LAWYER, I'M USED TO LISTENING, AND, UH... YOU MAKE THIS EASY. I'M VERY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT. SO WITH ALL THE MOVING AROUND AND STARTING OVER, YOU'RE PROBABLY PRETTY CLOSE WITH YOUR PARENTS, HUH? WITH MY MOM, YEAH. YEAH. MY DAD SPLIT WHEN I WAS THREE. HE TRAVELED A TON. HE WAS A TRUCKER. HE WORKED ON AN OIL RIG OFF THE GULF OF MEXICO. HE LED HIKING EXPEDITIONS IN ALASKA AND THE GRAND CANYON. WOW. I MEAN, THAT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD, THOUGH. YOU KNOW, NOT HAVING HIM AROUND. NO. NO. I MEAN, HE ALWAYS WROTE ME POSTCARDS FROM HIS TRAVELS. HE WAS AN ADVENTURER. HE'S ONE OF MY BIG INSPIRATIONS. - REALLY? - YEAH. WELL, I HOPE THE RESTAURANT WASN'T TOO STUFFY FOR YOU. OH, NO, IT WAS PERFECT. I LOVED IT. WELL, GOOD. UM... SO DOES THAT MEAN YOU'D CONSIDER GOING OUT WITH ME AGAIN? IT DEFINITELY MEANS THAT. DEFINITELY. I LIKE THAT. OKAY. WELL, HOW ABOUT THIS?

LIB, THE ROOMS AT THAT PLACE ARE OVER $500 A NIGHT. WHAT WOULD THAT MEAL HAVE COST? I KNOW, BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT, TESSA. HE TOOK ME THERE 'CAUSE HE THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE IT, AND I LOVED IT. OKAY, IT'S JUST THAT USUALLY YOU HATE THOSE KINDS OF PLACES. YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING THAT YOU PAY MORE FOR THE AMBIANCE THAN YOU DO FOR THE FOOD. WELL, THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS. OH, I HAD THE BEST TIME. OKAY. - OKAY? OKAY. LOOK, I KNOW THIS ISN'T NORMALLY THE KIND OF GUY THAT I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN, BUT, OH, THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT HIM. I REALLY WISH YOU COULD JUST BE HAPPY FOR ME. IAMHAPPY FOR YOU. REALLY? I WILL BE. THANKS. NOW FIX YOUR SHEET. WE NEED TO GET THE DETAILS FOR THE BELL OFFER DONE BY NO LATER THAN TOMORROW, AND I'M SLAMMED. CAN YOU FINISH IT? YEAH, YEAH, SURE.

YOU ARE LIBBY TAYLOR, HUH? YES. VERY NICE TO MEET YOU. NICE TO MEET YOU AS WELL. OH, YOU JUST MISSED JONATHAN. HE JUST RAN OUT. OH, NO, ACTUALLY, I WAS COUNTING ON THAT. I DIDN'T WANT TO FREAK HIM OUT BY SHOWING UP AT HIS OFFICE, YOU KNOW, AFTER OUR FIRST DATE, BUT I DID WANT TO TELL YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING ME MY FIRST CATERING GIG, AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REALIZED IT, BUT IT ALSO GAVE ME A SECOND CHANCE WITH JONATHAN. REALLY? SO, UM, I BROUGHT YOU LUNCH. OH, MY GOODNESS. YOU HAVE TO BE THE SWEETEST PERSON ON THE EARTH. OH, IT'S NOTHING. OH, WOW, OKAY. I HAVEN'T RIDDEN A BIKE SINCE JUNIOR HIGH. YOU ARE KIDDING ME. THAT'S TERRIBLE. IT'S SO FUN. YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.
