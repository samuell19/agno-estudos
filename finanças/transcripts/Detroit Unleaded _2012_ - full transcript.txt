Are you gonna come back? -Are you gonna tell Mike? 'Cause if you tell one person, it changes everything. -Okay, well, what about your friends? -I'll take care of my friends. Just don't say anything about me to Mike. -Can I come see you at the store? -No. Do not do that. Fadi only needs one more dot before he puts this whole thing together and finds out that you're my boyfriend. -So...that's what we're doing? -What, you think I'm coming back here as your gas-station whore? -No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Okay. -Okay.

They're your customers. You don't care what they think about you? -No. They stay on their side. I stay on mine. They give me money. I give them lollipops. They're happy for five minutes, they come back, and they buy more. You think he's never seen a girl behind the cage before? -Nice. I thought all you do is work. [Speaks arabic] He calls himself. -* the one who looks over -that's not... -* a timid and shy smile * if only I could... -Where's these lollipops?

I mean, don't you want to be with me? -What do you think I'm doing here? I am here. I am with you. -But you don't want to kiss me. You're the dream crusher, you know? [ Sighs ] [ Chuckles ] Can you blame me? -No. -[ Chuckles ] Just one kiss? -No. There's your bed. You want my red ones? -I'll take your red ones. -I'm the one with everything to lose. Don't you see that? If I get caught, my parents will lock me up, and then I'll never get out of this place. -Where are you going? -What, you think I'm gonna run fadi's empire forever? I got plans, bro. -What plans? Like what? -I'm not gonna tell you. You'll get jealous and put a curse on me. -No. Um...i was thinking, "wow, this girl's really pretty, and I want to kiss her." So...are you gonna kiss me? -[Speaking arabic] Don't you ever give up? -No. -Well, I don't do that. -That's 'cause you're an updo girl. -No, not because I'm an updo girl. -Give me your phone. -For what? -So I can call fadi and ask him permission to take you out in this special updo. -You're gonna call my brother? -I'm gonna call your brother. -I'd like to see you turn a phone on first before you make a phone call. -Here. Call him. -But you know he's gonna want to come with US, though. And then you'll be dating fadi, too. I just like it here with you. -What's here? You know, I told Mike you were no updo girl. -You told Mike? -Um... [ Sirens wail in distance ] -Sami, you told Mike? -Well, he's not gonna tell anybody. He's ... he's my cousin. Look, he's not ... come on. Wait. Wait. -You told Mike. -Yes, he's my cousin. -It doesn't matter. You told someone, and we had a deal. It's over. And I'm never coming back here again.

What are you gonna do? -Maybe I'll buy a gas station. -[ Chuckles ] -You hate it here, don't you? I would, too, if I were in your shoes. Your father always had these ambitions to franchise, open up a bunch of stations on the east side. He was getting there, too. I know your cousin Mike want the same thing.

I mean, where else would I wear this to? -What do you want from me? -I want to be anonymous. I want to walk into a gas station and not have 20 guys call my brother. -Then why do you want me to call him? -It would just be so much easier. Then I wouldn't have to sneak around. -What about your big secret plans? Aren't you leaving? -You believed me? -Of course I believed you. -Say, "wallah, you believed me." -Wallah, I believed you. You do want to marry me. -What? -You want to marry me. I mean, come on. It's obvious. I think it'd be perfect if you kissed me right now in that dress. -Through the glass? -No, not through the glass.
