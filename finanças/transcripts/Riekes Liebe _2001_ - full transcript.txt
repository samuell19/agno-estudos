Dad, please tell me, is it a date or not? Please, dad. Tell me. Dad! My God, don't make yourself a fool, Friederike. Don't make me a fool? Yes, you make yourself a fool. As always. Stop it, dad. It's no use. You're driving me crazy, girl. It's all fixed, don't worry. I'm not worried. Let me do it. Well, that was obvious, they're done. The main thing is, we'll get to the top at all. Rieke. Everything okay? Darling, remember the car keys, okay? Don't forget them again. Oh my God, I hope the kids are sleeping soundly. Theo and Luise, be nice, okay? Don't look far again, okay? Okay. Promise. Honey, do you remember the money for the babysitter? The 18-year-old pig Kaila is not a liar. Oh my God, honey, how cute! Rieke? Yay! Get away! Get away! Help! Get away! That's not funny, is it? It is. Get away! Whoa! Help! While all other animals are in panic mode, the lioness seals the fate of the postman. Think about it, JÃ¼rgen. This advertising deal will easily bring you a quarter of a million a year. Then you'll be in debt. Now wait for the master's degree. My children are in top shape. They've hardly ever been like this. Don't look at me like that. I'm not looking. We'll start the harvest next Saturday. We've been working on it for years. I know that. I mean, Nils has such a talent, such a spirit. I'll make you a world-class runner. I'll think of something for Friederike. After all, I'm her godfather. We wouldn't have thought of it if we'd heard you talk like that, honey. But very pretty. Very pretty, the campaign. A quarter of a million. Yes, then you'll be in debt for a few more years. Spare the specialist salesmen. I'd have to wear the jogging shoes. Nice. Tell me, why are you so sure that my wife won't make it? Why? Did I say something? Now the star coach has a feeling. Okay, stop. That was just an offer from me. Pretty lucrative. Rieke! We're leaving soon. Tell Nils. Half an hour, okay? She looks like her mother was cut out of her face. That was in 1988. Four months before her death. Regina. Yes, that was a long time ago. And you'd like to really screw it up, hm? I mean, I would, I would relatively. You know that. Training, training, training. And at night you watch a little bit of TV for relaxation. Oh, I think I would come up with other things. I'm sorry. I don't think that's bad. You know, I've been running here since I was five. Good is of course a hard life. Always on the go, life out of the suitcase. In a hotel the whole diet is a mess. But I think you always have to sacrifice something. Sacrifice? It's not possible without sacrifice. You know, as an ice skater we can't do anything else because we're obsessed, somehow. Rababarababa. Rababa. Yes, obsessed. We can't think of anything else. We're obsessed. Man, Nils, where have you been all this time? Good that you're coming. You can free me from your brother. Why? What's he doing? I've got nothing. He's totally obsessed. That was obvious. I just explained to him what professional means. Are you drunk? Then I didn't really get it. Oh, oh, no, no, no. No. You see, he's totally obsessed. He's drunk and not obsessed. He just can't stand it. Then he's always so weird. Come on, let's dance. I think your brother can't right now. He's totally crazy. He has to come now. We have to dance. Maybe you'd rather dance a round with your honey horses. What were their names again? Werner and Bianca? Theo and Luise. Oops. I shouldn't have talked about it. Unfortunately, you can't. They're already sleeping. Hopefully. What are your friends saying about you being so obsessed? What? Oh, them? What friends? They can still come. We are the champions! But we had that. The Bund... The Trade Union of North German Merchants is called... A little tip, start with H. Show us the monster tip. Friederike. You can't concentrate, you're talking all the time. What? I didn't even think about it. Our little ice cream. Yes, it's good. Quiet! But I can already tell who's provoking who. Not him, red cap. Every time. We're home. The ice cream is running. Two minus. Two minus? With the swab back? That's a flat five. But Nils, it could be that you have no idea about women. Or it could be that you're disabled. Buried or shaved. Doesn't matter, but not the expensive ones. And now the photo is leaking out, you shooter. No. So with this phone number, there's nothing to say. When I was your age, I got three numbers from women per night. Yes, as a medium. That was before the accident. But if you're so sure, call her. Why call? Oh, you don't understand, boy. Women test men, women give their numbers and test. What do they test? If you've got guts, if you're a bottle or if you're brave. If you let the three days wait, you're screwed. That's not my philosophy, Uwe. You have to take it step by step. With style. You know what I think? You didn't get a phone number. You would have liked to, but you don't. Yes. Not bad. One minus, I'd say. One minus? One plus! Plus is not possible. Hey, look! No! It's about the time for the open training. But five days before the German championship, there has to be a schedule. Mr. Wiemeyer? You're not being paid for making calls. I know, sorry. But try to get into the other ranks. They say that Frederique gets her arrogant tits in a row, is absent because of some tournament, and doesn't talk to anyone, because she thinks she's better. You're just jealous, you don't have to take it so seriously. I take it seriously. Can't you try to take a small step to the other ranks? There are so many nice people in your class. Andi, for example, or Sonja. Just dare, they don't bite. I have to go now, unfortunately. I still have to go to the training. Frederique! You isolate yourself with your way, and in the end you end up alone. They don't understand anything at all. What did she say to you? Doesn't matter now. He's frozen. Just believe it. Nonsense. He was never frozen. Happy New Year. Come on, you lazy toad. Always easy, Rike. That's what happens when you get drunk. I wasn't drunk. Of course you were. Otherwise you wouldn't have been so weird. You know exactly what I mean. It was pretty embarrassing how you acted. It wasn't. I was just talking. That's all. You didn't crash into her, did you? Nils! Stop! He's frozen. You have no idea. I am the ghost of the Waldsee! I smell human flesh! Hey. You're dreaming all the time. You're standing right next to her. What are you imagining? Yes, all the time. What's wrong with dad today? Dad fell in love. What was that, Mara? He didn't say anything. It was Bernhard and Bianca. No, Theo and Luise. I was confused. Do you have a problem? No. I didn't fall in love. You're so childish for your age. You're in love. Look at me. What? Come on. If you're not in love, you can look at me. It's none of your business, you hear? Well, I just mean it. Because the number is too big for you. I'll just keep it that way. But at some point it's enough. And then I'm gone. Are you still there? I was lucky. You can play alone. Oh, now daddy is angry. But mum was right. It's all too individual, too much to fight. You have to be more self-confident. I've told you a hundred times. Tension... In the middle of the body during the lift. I know. We have to pay more attention to that next time, okay? No. Rieke, not we. Not we, you. It's about your mistake, the doctor can't do anything about it. Dad, let's try it out tomorrow at the training on site. If we talk about it now... It's just about a few technical details anyway. Rieke, you don't hear it, it's not about technique. It's about your overall expression. Shall we see how something like that works with Lydia Pascal? No, we don't want to. Sorry, but I still have homework to do. Look at this. Can't we just do it tomorrow? That's what I mean. This is Pep, this is Esprit, this is sexy, this is international, this is the opposite of you. Nils, are you already sleeping? Nils? Nils? Hello. I have to think about you all the time. You've somehow totally messed me up, because... I thought you were really cute the other day. I think I'm a little crazy about you. Is it bad? No. No, it's cheesy. Shit. Hi, doll. Guess who's here. Surprise. You know, I have to go to Munich the next few days anyway, and... No. I wanted to ask, because you said we both... So, if you have time, a little meeting, at a cafe or at the cinema. Ludia? Vegetable? Nonsense. Something's not right today. You're totally unconcentrated. Federica? Why? It's Friday as always. No, it's not as always. You pushed me off the plane. Rieke, do you need a special invitation? I have the feeling you're really looking for a lot today. How would it be if you would sleep at night? Let's not talk big, let's just do it normally. Nils? Let's look at it first, otherwise it won't make any sense. So, you didn't get the pressure point again, because the blind... That doesn't help to look at the mistakes. Let's just try it normally. Nils, come on, please! If you're going to be like this, we don't need to go to the championship. The judges will laugh at us. But I did it exactly as you explained it to me. Unfortunately you didn't. Otherwise it would have looked better. There, look here. Then you have to explain it to me better. It's obvious that we're going to Garmisch in three days. Rieke, listen to me when I'm talking to you. I've been working my ass off for years and you're playing the little diva. Do you think it's okay? No. What have you achieved so far? If it matters. It's not that much, Rieke. Dad. Rieke. Hello, listen to me. Who's fooling around? Are you serious? Dad, stop it, please. Get out of here, I'm staying with your sister. No, but that's totally unfair. Oh, do you want to play the hero again? No, but you can't do that. We're still a family after all. Well, if that's the case... then do it. I think you have to tighten the screw here. Something is wobbling. Yes, I'll do that later. I don't know what's going on today. Yes, Rieke. You know that. You're under pressure. And that's always been a problem for you. You have to get through it, no one else can help you. Yes, I know. But do you know what Nils said today? Rieke, it doesn't help that you keep pushing Nils. It's your own fear. He has to look us in the eye. No one can help you. Not me and... Nils almost can't. If I overdo it, you have to tell me. Then we have to draw the consequences. What consequences? I don't want to play the bad guy. Then we combine Nils with another runner. And with whom? Only with Lydia. She's looking for a new partner. Because Hagen injured his knee. There is a concrete offer on the table and it's really about a lot of money. I think it's a comedy, Rieke. It's not a comedy. Be quiet. Isn't that funny? It's because you don't have a sense for it. No sense for what? For romance. If you know what it is. No. Explain. Well, if two people flirt, for example. Attention, expert. First you look deep into each other's eyes. Then you pretend to find the other person terribly boring. And then you kiss. Hurry up, please. I'm not stupid, but I'd invite her to dinner, and fill her up with red wine so she can't drive. That's important. And then to the pleasure. And always ready to take out the gum. It wasn't so important before, but the women of today... Can you shut up for five minutes? My God, you're so confused. It'll never work. Excuse me. Do you take out the gum? Wine gum? Okay. No, eh, condoms. Condoms. The condom isn't for me, but the young man back there doesn't dare to ask. So... Don't listen to him. He's mentally retarded. What am I? Ah! Help! Ah! My ear! Well, chilling again? Pretty shitty when you're sitting here all alone, huh? What are you doing this afternoon? Why? Well, I'm going to the cafe to play some football. I can't. I have training. Well, you can't always train. No, you can't. And after that? I've already made an appointment with someone. And... when else? No, I don't think so, to be honest. What can I say, Rieke? Good, nice, very gentle. So, it's possible. And don't give up now. Nils? You're slurping. And Nils, look at her now! Do you have to go again? Yes, Uwe had a problem with his e-roller. Probably the batteries are all dead again. And when will you come back? Why? It can't take that long. Hey. Nils? You smell good. I have to go. He's standing outside and can't leave. Have fun. Have fun? It's work, not fun. You know what I hate about small towns? That people stare at you like in a zoo. It's because of your advertising. I don't understand you when you talk so quietly. It's because of your advertising that's hanging around here. I think it's pretty good. Uh-huh. It must be a terrible feeling when you're hanging around like this in the city. You get used to it. I'm sorry, I have to go. Really? Can you still drive? Why not? I'm just going to Munich, it's a nice place. Yeah, probably. Tell me, what do you think of my offer? Well, it's interesting. I just have to be with my family. You know, my sister. Do you want to have a drink with me? Do you want to have a drink with me? Hey, I'll invite you, no problem. == You're going to go to bed, aren't you? == I am. I'm exhausted. == You have to go to bed, though. == I really have to go back today. Tell me, what are you planning to do? == Are you drunk again? == Just a little bit. I think that's pretty unprofessional, right before the championship. But I'm not interested. I wanted to tell you something. Something important. What kind of secret negotiations are you having? Are you going crazy? You're having secret negotiations behind my back. I know exactly what's going on. Dad told me everything. These Lydia's are looking for new runners and... You're being hysterical. This Hergen has injured himself and you're supposed to replace him. You're a traitor. That's not what it's about. Don't you get it? You're sniffing my private life. It's two days before the German Championships. You're negotiating with this pussy, you stupid ass. I don't care when I'll meet her. You don't give a shit. You don't stand a chance with her. She's just wiggling around and you think she wants something from you. Shut up. You don't stand a chance with her. Because you're such a little pimple. I'm still going to feel really bad for her. Can you give me the butter, please? Please, please, please, the butter. Please, please, please, the butter. Tell me, is there something eaten out of you? Me? This woman, your teacher, oh God, what's her name? Mrs. Neumann. Oh, red cap. What? That's her nickname. Yeah, whatever, she wants me to come to my parents' tonight. But I don't like that at all. We'll see each other later. Don't be too late, this is a final rule, just as a reminder. Did you hear that, little boy? Rieke! Are you crazy? Did you hurt yourself? He's crazy, he just let me go! I didn't do anything. She's just limping, as always. It hurts. Now you two, pull yourselves together! It's not going to be like the horse anyway. We can stay at home. Stop talking nonsense! You stay in your circle and Rieke, tighten your hips! Is it really that bad? I don't know if you really appreciate your daughter. I see that she's suffering. And that's partly because she barely has time to think about anything else than running on ice. But now you're getting mixed up in the questions of the relationship. No, I mean, it's impossible to separate. I'm just starting to understand. What? With the red cap, the hair, nothing! Nothing! Mr. Wehmeyer, you're overreaching your daughter. You're isolating her. I mean, it's certainly not easy for you as an only child father. Now, listen to me, Mrs. Lahn. Have you ever heard of goals? Of visions? That there's something in life that's more important than anything else? That's high-performance sports. It can be heaven or hell. It's victory or defeat. And in any case, it's better than being poisoned all day and hanging out in front of some video games. And as long as you haven't understood that, please spare me your pedagogical nonsense. I'm sorry about earlier. But you know, maybe it's better if we don't run together any longer. The championship is still on and then game over. You used to pee in my bathtub. Can you pee somewhere else? Not that long ago. Take care. I'd put on something. It's very cold, you know. You're quite a bright boy, you know. Has anyone ever told you how silly it looks with your mini-tits? Is someone getting threatened? Leave it. Are you afraid? Oh my God, the little baby is really afraid. You don't need to be afraid. No. Come on, little baby. Little baby. Little baby. Little baby. Oh, yes, kiss me. Shut the door. Kiss me. Not so gently. Don't be afraid. You're kissing like a pig. You're crazy. But Rico has to eat something too. Otherwise you'll collapse us tomorrow. Come on, one for daddy. What's up with her today? Is she having a bad day or what? Who should know? I have a pair like that, Friederike and Nils Wehmeyer. You have the big chance. Basically, the first place is clear. You can take the lead. In this new situation, is the pressure a little different? Has the pressure changed? The pressure is always there. But the preliminary race went optimally. We systematically prepared for tomorrow. Oh, I've sorted out the thing with the ice rink. Just send Nils over, we'll check him out. I can go for a walk with Lydia. Peter, I still don't feel like talking to you about it. Well, but Werner Wehmeyer can be home soon. My God, are you sensitive today? Of course I'm sensitive when you're hanging on to me like a man. Could it be that you're running away from something? Yes, from you. Peter, I have two children. You can't just tear them apart like that. It has to do with family. Yes, yes, family. Back then you didn't even know how to wrap your own children. But you... No, but I'm not talking nonsense. Look, if someone raised his children professionally, then you. There was no aura. You learn to jump by falling. You said you were tough and consistent. That's what sports require. Yes, but I don't expect anything else from you. If Lydia does it tomorrow, with Nils, I'll be the first to congratulate you. But if not, then you'll have to make a decision. A professional decision. Tough and consistent. Please turn off the TV and go to bed. That's no use. Liga, it's half past two. Please go to bed. You like to eat, don't you? Finally you're here! How do you look? Now tell me! Get lost! You want to fumble again? Leave me alone! Stop it! Who started it? I'm sorry. We won't make it. Don't cry, Rick. I'm here. Everything's as usual. It's not as usual. It's all over. Good night. Good night. Now it's all about here and now. You have the audience on your side. I noticed that when I walked in. They're behind you. Did you catch a cold? Not so dramatic. That's because you're half-naked. Forget it. It's no use saying anything. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Full speed ahead. Look at me, Rieke. So, let's go. Come on. It's not decided yet. It's just a test. Think about how it went. You can do it. You will make it. And always think about the rubbers. Hey! Are you crazy? You could have... I have time today, by the way. Because you said you could have coffee or something. Psst! We don't want to disturb you. We just want to listen. Keep going. Well? Did Friederike get mad at you? Aww, did she say something funny to you? Come on, you have to say something! No. No, no. She just asked if I wanted to go to the cafÃ© with her. You disappoint us too much. I told her to piss off. Pooping is correct. But not with frigidairike. I'm not going to drink coffee with a fart. It's too tight anyway. Moschitechnically. Except for the virgin. That's just smell. Not nice frigidairike. Leave me alone, you proll. What? What was that? Prolete. Oliver, stop it! Oliver, stop it! I wanted to do it again. I was just finishing. Tell me, are you completely crazy now? I'm talking to you. Someone has to tell you what to do, so that this doesn't happen again. I mean... I've held you back once, sorry. I understand. You know we both understand each other. I'll show you. You won't learn anything, you little brat. Now, piss off. You can't let them provoke you, they're idiots. Yeah, yeah, I know. Thanks. It was nice of them. These are excellent fitness values. Here, touch times, jump heights. You're a real masterpiece. Well, I think Mr. Tropsch is out. We can start training tomorrow. Yeah, I don't want to waste any time. We'll take care of your apartment. Don't worry about that. And I'll have a contract signed. Nils. It's about gold at the wedding. We're putting our hopes in you. You'll get to know each other a bit, I'd say. Have fun. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm just thinking. We're offering you heaven on earth and you're thinking. Crazy. It's because of your sister, isn't it? Nonsense. But you can think about it. You know what? You just have to decide. Maybe it's nicer to hang out in front of the window at home, to stuff chips into yourself and to dream about a big wide world. No evaluation, that's possible. But if that's the case, you better go home right away. I'm taking a break. I'll pack the whole year's worth of stuff, and the overtime, and then... I'll go to the south, where it's warmer. What do you think? Maybe we could do a diving course together? You used to be very keen on diving in coral. You're acting as if it was all decided. It's not, is it? God, we can't do this. You're a big girl, Linda. Now everything is going to be completely different. We have to think about what you're going to do with the school holidays. When do you have Easter holidays, Rieke? Hello? Theo, is that you? Not Theo. Louise. That's Theo. They just wanted to say good night. How are you? I mean, what did you do today? Hello, Rieke. Are you still there? Yes, yes. We have a mega-act here. Carlo is a great coach, but he's talking so much. Nils? Are you coming back? Yes? I have to finish. I have to go to training. I'll call you back. Okay? Please don't tell Donga. I don't know. Maybe it's better if we don't see each other again. I'll call you back, okay? Bye. Bye, Rika. Sorry, I'll be ready in a minute. I'm excited, man. Susu. Now come in. You're still going to get the dead man out. And I thought the world would end. Because I'll never find someone like Fabian again. Until a friend told me, that true love is usually the first love for no man in the world. You'll fall in love again and then... then you'll have forgotten him. You'll even be happy that you're rid of him. Don't you think so? I don't know. Well, I don't think so. How long were you together with your boyfriend? Quite a long time. I'm surprised. Do you have a husband now? A boyfriend, to be precise. We're not married. What's your boyfriend's name? Your ex-boyfriend. It's not that important. Tell me, maybe I know him. No, he's not really my boyfriend. It's getting complicated. What's wrong with you? You can tell me everything. I'll tell Glenn. Promise? It's because of my brother. What are you doing tonight? Are you celebrating? Well... If you can't stop thinking about it. Maybe you can just come to my place and we'll celebrate together. I mean, I'd be happy. Well, I have to go now. That's my address. Look, a rubber barrel. It should have been here sooner. And there are no wax sticks on the carpet. There are a few technical problems, but we'll get them. By the way, Santa Claus is here. Ta-da! I brought you something. Hello, Rieke! Presents! Don't you want to see? It wasn't easy to get. Now wait a minute! Where are you going? I have a date. You? With whom? It's none of your business. Aha. But we wanted to celebrate together tonight. Nils, think of the goose. Otherwise it will be spoiled. Can you celebrate with dad? Who thinks about the birds in the oven now? Man, Frederike! That's a surprise. Come in. I didn't expect this at all. Give it to me. But it's great! Give me your jacket. I got a visit. But it doesn't matter, we'll celebrate together. Sigi? This is my friend Sigi. He's studying sociology. He's doing his doctorate. Hi, I'm Frederike. From my class. Ah, yes. Nice. You're lucky, dinner's just been served. Tell me, do you want to stay here all night? Don't be so nice, I'll give you some more. I don't want to. Stop it! We've got all night for that, you little rascal. Do you like Hawaii toast? Hawaii what? The contract is at 6,000. You just have to sign it. Strange that it's all supposed to be over now. I'll have to see if I can do it without getting into a fight. It doesn't look like it. I just don't think it's a good idea to just let Christmas go. Let it go. Christmas is still a family holiday. I think it's best for all of us if Rieke can finally find some friends. On your table, for every glass I drank, for the plate you put next to yours, it would be more natural not to say good night. Good night, friends. It's time. Tell me, Rieke, you have exactly the same glasses as I do. Oh, right. Can I have another one? A cigarette. Oh, that's nice. Where is the bathroom? What? Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, it's yours. Thank you, otherwise I always feel so old. So you go to the hallway and take the second door on the right. I didn't come all the way from Frankfurt to spend the whole evening in the kindergarten. Stop it with your idiotry. Can't you have a little understanding? What do you mean, how should I have understanding? Have some understanding for me. Should I have sent you away again? Yes, of course. Then we'll see each other once in the holy time and then... And then something like this. What can I do with this? I'll go and get my brother. Then you should fuck him. You're kidding me. I'm sorry. Frederike! We'll see each other in a new year. Your hat! She forgot her hat. What are you talking about? What I have to say, takes a cigarette and a last glass standing. No, it's really expensive. I mean, the city is terribly loud and big and the people are pretty cheeky. Since Bavaria. Great. No. But that's okay. When are you leaving again? What? When are you going to Germany? New year. I got the stuff here in the mail. Dad took care of everything. Luise. So you won't forget me. Well, then I have two rooms now. That's pretty good, too. And we can visit each other from time to time. Maybe. In the Easter holidays, maybe. Sure. We'll get you an apartment. Then you'll come visit me. And then we'll make the city unsafe. It'll be funny. Not because of Enrique. Just because it's so beautiful right now. It's over. See? Come on. Ah! Let me down! Woohoo! Yeah! Woohoo! Hey, this is so crazy here! The nature here, this is a real honor! Dick, I have a totally crazy idea! I'm staying here! Oh, come on, stop it, you idiot! It's crazy, but I don't feel like Munich at all! Munich is crap, what am I supposed to do there? It's good, Nils, stop it! That's what I mean! We can start over again! Next season is Olympia, it would be... It's over, Nils! Who says so? Dad says everything is decided, so everything is decided! Dad! I'm 19, I can do whatever I want! I won't let dad tell me anything! Besides, I haven't signed the contract yet! What? The contract! I haven't signed the contract yet! Or you don't feel like it anymore? It's no fun, Nils! It's no fun? We'll tell dad! We just have to find the right moment! So, who is it? We need alcohol. Absolutely alcohol. What's dad drinking? Something high in proportion. What's he drinking? Apple cider vinegar. It's written on the front. Apple cider vinegar. That's very, very good. What's up with the bride? I think Lydia has a sharp tooth. She's not as great as she looks. I mean, character-wise. Right. You didn't get a high score on her. Neither Nils' room is over there. Federica will get that, too. I thought you didn't want to celebrate. We have a visitor. Who are they? They're still the same. Culture Girls, I'm from Berlin. Culture Girls. Nice, very beautiful. You have to talk to him right now. If we wait any longer, it won't be worth it. He's going completely crazy. That's a nice one. Dad, this might be an unfavorable moment, but I have to talk to you. Nils won't go to Munich. Well, not to Munich today. He drank way too much. You know what, Rieke? Hey, Rieke, I'm so looking forward to the new year. I think a lot will change here. I've never experienced that before. But your brother is so sweet. Totally cute. Lydia Pascal falls in love with her partner. If the press finds out, there will be a huge commotion. Well, but you don't have to apologize for love. It's possible. But Nils won't come with you. He'll stay here. But he didn't say anything to Sonja. Then that's enough. I think you'll like it better. I don't think so. You can ask him. I don't need to. He already signed the next contract. Oh, crap. I'm really sorry. It wasn't fair. But I thought he told you already. Don't look at me like that. I'm not the bad one here. Stop this shit! You think you can fool everyone, but you're wrong! I only told you that I fell in love with your brother, okay? Is that forbidden? Oh, yeah, because of whom? In love, you stupid slut! What do you know about love? More than you think! At least more than you! Why are you destroying everything? What's wrong, Casanova? I just don't think it's okay that you're just sneaking in without telling me beforehand. You ran away from Munich without telling me. And that's not okay. Oh, that was just because... Yeah. I know why. I think you have to talk to your little sister. She's totally going crazy. What did she do? She said you wanted to stay here. Talk to her. Are you okay? She's totally crazy, really. What's up? Nothing. Just say it. You don't want to stay here, do you? I do. Didn't I tell you? Yes, yes. You did. I have no idea why she's showing up here. It was not planned at all. Do you like her? You like her. Watch out for tomorrow's breakfast, I'm telling you. And dad too. He's totally crazy lately. Promised? Hello? Promised? Promised! Promised! Stop it! No. They're all still awake. Yeah. Drive! Shit! Go back in! Go back in! Go to dad! Give me the bag! Give me the damn bag! Go away! Go away! Please! Please! Leave me alone! You should finally leave me alone! Get lost! Nils, what have I done to you? I'll hurry. And don't run away again, okay? Yes! Yes! Out of the feathers! The sun is shining. It's already half past three. It's real imperial weather. Let's go. We'll have a real breakfast first.
