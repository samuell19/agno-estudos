- Hotel Atlantic? Give me the hall porter. Listen there, there's a gentleman waiting for me in the hall. An odd-looking gentleman called Sunshine. Yes, sir, hold on, please. Hello. You! Telephone. Number two. - Oh, there you are, now, Sunshine, call up some of the morning papers. Tell them there's a story. At the Lennartz Shipyard, between 11:00 and 11:05 tonight. Lennartz Shipyard, yes. It's a story with a kick in it, you might get hurt. Don't go to sleep while you are doing it. Keep my name out of it, and uh... - May I be in on this? - On what? - Whatever it is at the Lennartz Shipyard. - Lennartz Shipyard? - Hello! Are you not there? All right, good night. - I'm afraid you are making a mistake. - Oh, I see. Excuse me. - As a matter of fact, I did have an appointment at 11:00. In a more convenient place than a shipyard. Fortunately I was putting it off. My luck is marvelous. Would you like to dance? - No, thank you. As a matter of fact, I have an appointment at 11:00 too. - Do you know who that is? That's Ellissen, the famous airman. He's just flown back from Australia in record time. - Excuse me, Mathias, I must talk to you a moment. - Claire, not in the middle of a hand. - Oh-- - Sorry. - Conrad-- - Darling, I can't stop. I'm losing. Two, no trumps. - Pass. - That did it. - All right. My car, please. - Boy? Car for Miss Lennartz. - Now look here, boys, have I ever let you down? No. Hey, we're from the press. What's going on here? - Nothing ever goes on while I'm about. Oh. - There, what did I tell you? Mm hmm. F-P one. - Hello. What's going on here? - I don't know. The fire brigade turns up-- - Oh look! There's a light on up there. - Oh, there you are. They have surrounded the crooks. They're fighting like madmen. You have a very nice camera there, what about a picture? Come on, hurry up. And now you call the police, good night. - Property of B. Droste, Lieutenant Commander. Telephone, 4432. - Hello? Yes, Commander Droste speaking. What, Lennartz Shipyard? Stolen, tonight? No one knew my drawings were there. Certainly, I'll come along at once. Lennartz Shipyard. - Commander Droste, what exactly was in the file? - I think that's a matter for the police alone. - You need have no scruples, commander. This is Mr. Mathias Lennartz and his brother, Mr. Konrad Lennartz. - The files contained the drawings of a project on which I've been working for years, called the FP1. It seems that no one here had time to look at them. - Who is this Commander Droste? A lieutenant commander, really. - Just what is this FP1? - I hardly think the lady would be interested. - In fact you'd rather I wasn't here. - Sir, she's our sister. It's as much her business as ours. - I'm sorry, I merely thought it would be very entertaining. After all, it's a purely technical matter. - Commander Droste is perfectly right. If it is a purely technical matter, I shall probably be bored to tears. Good night. There she is now. What's going on? - Anything yet? - Do they know who the thief is? - The thief? No. No! No, they haven't the slightest idea. - The FP-- - Good evening, Major Ellisen. Hello. - I'm sorry to disturb your supper, but it appears you're a thief. This evening you broke in to the Lennartz Yard. - The Lennartz Yard again. I knew you had an interest in that old shipyard. - Yes, you're quite right. As a matter of fact, I own exactly 33 and third percent of it. You see, I'm Claire Lennartz. Oh. Now you have disturbed my supper. - It may disturb you further to know that at this moment the police are making inquiries. - Oh, I see, you came here to warn me, thank you. - Oh, no, I didn't. I came for the designs of the FP1. - And if you don't get them? I suppose you are going to call the police and get me arrested. - I don't care what happens to you. I want those plans to be found. - Really? Is that all you want? Then we both want the same thing. Well, before you call the police, would you be good enough to get on to that shipyard of yours? - Hello. - If your brothers are in the filing office, it would be a good idea if they went up just one flight of stairs to the floor above. - Into my office? Really, I've got to? For some unexplained reason we've got to go into my office. - Good lord. - What's all this about? - Just a minute. Your brothers are now only halfway upstairs. They won't have any difficulty about getting in. - Already open. - No! - Hello. Is that Miss Lennartz? - They're in the office now. - Well it would be a very good idea if they would pay attention to the blotter which is bang in front of them. You're to pay attention to the blotter, which is bang of front of you. Those are my drawings! The FP!! - Thank you, gentlemen. - Now for some good hot coffee. I've earned it, haven't I? - Well, you've called out the fire brigade, broken into our offices, disturbed the whole town in the middle of the night. Yes, I think you've earned it, all right. However, if you're not too interested in your coffee, why did you-- - Why did I steal the drawings that I didn't steal at all, yes. - Yes. - Of course, it must seem rather odd to you. You see, Droste and I have known each other for years. Everything that men could go through between heaven and earth, we went through together. And after the war, Droste lost himself in his drawings. But I climbed into my airplane and fluttered around the globe a few times. And every time I'd come home, there sits Droste, getting more and more hopeless, waiting for someone to build his FP1. But your captains of industry won't even look at his drawings. They don't seem to know progress means. Suddenly I had a tremendous idea. I'll fetch the file with FP1 on it from the furthest corner of the filing office, and just by carrying it up one flight of stairs, prove to the captains of industry that there is something new in the world. - Well, you certainly chose a very a roundabout way of getting there. - Hmm. What else can you do nowadays? - I think it was marvelous of you to do it. Well, Droste would do the same for me. - You know, I feel a little ashamed of myself. - Why? Because you thought I was a gang of crooks, huh? - Mm hmm. - That's my fate. Always misunderstood. Are you gonna help us with the construction? - No, I'll let Droste do all that. But when the FP1 is ready, I'm going to the first to land on it. If they ask me nicely. - Yes, but what are you going to do now? - I'm starting on a big expedition tomorrow. Canada, Finland, Alaska. Perhaps stopping in at the North Pole. - Oh, I see. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Evening. - Evening. - Should we go outside? - Mm hmm. - I want to talk to you. I wish you'd been at the meeting, what a tremendous battle. They could all prove on paper that the FP1 couldn't be built. If I'd been a man I might have believed them. What about fellow Droste? He's as stubborn as an old professor, and as shy as a schoolboy. Well, what did you want to say just now? It's about this dropping in at the North Pole. Why don't you give up this eternal wandering around? Why should I? - A man can't always live in a hotel. You ought to have a home and a background. Don't you realize there are other things in the world besides breaking records and hunting elephants and flying across oceans. - Other things? - Mm. - Why, isn't that enough? - Well just now you're a popular hero. But that sort of thing doesn't last. This rushing 'round the globe doesn't get you anywhere. You oughta settle down. - Not at all. This life suits me beautifully. I can't settle down. - Is there nothing you mind leaving? - Eh? Yes. There is something here. Why, Elephant! Ellissen! - We ought never to have a waited. I hate being late for a conference. - We ought to have Ellisen here. I mean, after all, if it wasn't for him, there wouldn't be any FP1 to confer about. - I wouldn't say that. - Hello, hello! - Hello. - Hello, Droste. - How do you do? Are you ready, Major Ellisen? - No, I'm not coming. I'm not the sort of man for conferences. - What did I tell you? - What? Now look here, I'm sorry if I... - Anyway you'll be there, Miss Lennartz. - I'm afraid I wouldn't be very interested. You see it's a purely technical matter. - Oh, come along, Ellisen, I want you to be there. - I'm very sorry, there's another reason. I am booked up for this evening. We're waiting, Droste. - Bye. - Goodbye. - So long, Ellissen. - Goodbye. - Why don't you go with them? - Because I have a supper engagement. - What, here? - Yes, here. - Couldn't you put it off? - No I can't put it off, it's with you. Is it marvelous? Is it an amazing thing? The meteor works. There's a new model 7,000 TK at my disposal for a non-stop flight of the world. - It'll make a marvelous picture. - Sunshine, you old devil. There's some new for you! Non-stop, right 'round the world! Nobody's done that yet. Get hold of the bill. Pack the trunk! I am setting out at once. - Hello. Hold the line a minute. The lady. - What lady? - 10 o'clock sharp. - Hello. - Claire. Claire, do you know what's happened? - No, what? - I am going to be the first to fly non-stop 'round the world. Yes. Look at that. - Yes, but I thought you wanted to-- - To drop in on the North Pole? Oh, well I will cancel that. I have got something more important to do. Just a minute, hello, porter. - Hello. - Telephone to the flying ground. Let them tune up my machine. I'm starting in half an hour, no, no, no no. Just send a telegram. The Meteor Works, you know the address. Accept offer, arriving immediately. And send the bill, come on, hurry up, hurry up there. Claire, I'm awfully sorry. There was something I was going to tell you. But never mind, I will be back soon. I don't know exactly when, just a few days. How are you going to get home? Oh. That's all right, I've got my car outside. I only came because I thought... Well, it doesn't matter. Don't bother. - Claire, when, well, goodbye. Claire, goodbye. - Ellissen always talks like that. He'll be back in three days. And then he stops away three years. - What I shall say to Captain Droste is this: This FP1 ain't natural, that's what I shall say. And for why? Because if it had been natural to have an island in that particular spot, there'd've been one there already, and there wouldn't be a need for a second one. - Then what would you tell him? - You tell him about my tooth. I ain't superstitious, but you mark my words. Every time this tooth is bad, something awful... Now I remember the last time. What about a little work up there? Come on, get going! - Yes, and tell that fellow if he turns up again, I'll break his neck. You understand that? - What's the matter? - That man has been hanging around the place, trying to take photographs. They're just showing him the way out. - There, I'll fix ya if I catch you here again. how a man like that got in here. - You don't have anything to be proud of. I've been chucked out by better men than you. - We've gotta double the watch, Lubin. I don't like the look of things. - Double the watchmen? Just because of a miserable little photographer? Now what harm can he do? - Oh, it's not only because of that. What do you make of that? - That's from the front bows. - Exactly. Cut clean away! I found it in 412, between the double flooring. Now that can't all be bad workmanship, you know, it's impossible. Someone's playing around with those before they arrive. Have you told the police? - No, I haven't, and I'm not going to. We'd better settle this ourselves. It took years to gain the public confidence in the FP1. We can't afford to risk losing it like that. All right, Lubin, put on another shift. From now on, we work day and night. Right. - Hello. - Hello. - I'm awfully glad you came. Things are going extremely well and, and-- - And you're an extremely poor liar. Things aren't going well. - But, they are, really they are. - Oh, Droste. Can't you tell me? What is going on here? - Some important drawings were stolen here. Two days later they turned up again. Two days'd be plenty of time to copy them. These are the plans of the sprinkler system, for putting out fire. - Mm hmm. You see, there are spies in industry as well as war. - But no one else can build the FP1. - No, but they can destroy it. From the first day, something's been working against me, something I can't lay my hands on. What it is I don't know. Vested interests, international concerns, perhaps some great trust or combine. Something impersonal, without a soul. You see, progress sacrifices the old order of things. That's why progress always has its enemies. - Our confidential man has carried out his orders. But his work's been intercepted and the results you require have not been achieved. - Inform our confidential man that no further measures are to be undertaken for the present. - These people can't be caught. And if you did catch anyone, it would be some fool of a workman who wants to earn a little extra money, and who knows nothing at all about the whole business. But I'll beat them, all right. We'll build the FP1 in spite of all of them. In two years, you'll have forgotten all about this. And the FP1'll be stationed in mid-Atlantic with airplanes coming to it from all over the world. You know who'd be the first to land on it? - No, who? - Ellissen. - Ellis-- - Of course, Ellisen. Oh, he'll turn up again, all right. He's been missing before. And always when people least expect him, he returns to civilization. - Well I hope you're right. Oh, I wish I could do something to help you. - You have helped, a great deal. In fact, you've helped more than anybody. - How? - By be believing in my ideas from the very start. And if you go on believing, we can't fail. - Of course I will. - Lennartz Yard, calling Captain Droste. - He's not here, send 'round for him. Calling Captain Droste. Calling Captain Droste. Calling Captain Droste, Calling Captain Droste. Lennartz Yard, calling Captain Droste. - Amber, which one? - In there, sir. Droste speaking. - Lennartz Yard here. - Good morning, gentlemen. - It's good evening where we are, Droste. - Yes, of course. Well everything's in perfect order. You can send your airliners whenever you like. We're absolutely ready for them. - Hello. How are you? - Hello. Hold on a second. I'm awfully glad you're there too. - Are things really all right? - Yes, really. Promise me nothing's happened. Oh dear, I've been so worried about you. - Have you really, Claire? - Mm. - Then perhaps I can tell you something I, well I've wanted to tell you, only, well it's easier now that I'm miles away from you. Listen Claire, we only have a half minute more. I... you... Well I'd better tell you when I see you. - Oh, no no, no tell me now. We'll be cut off in a minute. - Well, Claire, I wanna tell you that-- Hello? - Hello? Oh. Oh. - Ellissen! Ellissen! Man, where have you been all this time, how are... - Good evening, Major Ellissen. Where on earth have you turned up from? Well, I suppose you know we've built the FP1 and it's already in position. - Yes, I've heard all about it. - We've just been speaking to Droste. - I wanted to be here before but, but I really couldn't manage it. - Anyway, I'm glad you're here now. - Well where have you been all this time? Come along and tell us about it. Yes. Please. - Give me your hat. - Thanks. Sit down, won't you? Cigarette? - Oh yes, where have I been all the time. Well, it's a long story. A non-stop flight, as you know, that stopped. And then, what happened then? Oh, yes, my friend the governor of Manila wanted me to go cruising with him. And then we made a trip to the South Seas and from there we went on to um, to um, let me see. Where was it? Oh never mind, I'll tell you some other time. - Well, why don't you have dinner with us? We can talk about things then. - Yes, yes do. - That's a good idea. - And now if you'll excuse me, Ellissen, I've got a good deal to do. - Of course. - Conrad, you've got to see the press association. - Oh, yes. Right you are, see you later. - You're quite right. I was making it all up. You told me my luck wouldn't last forever. After I crashed in Alaska, I didn't say where I was. I didn't like to. You see, I've never failed before. I had no plane. I had no money. I didn't want to come home a failure. I tried one thing after another, but nothing succeeded. Once your luck's out, it stays out. I've had plenty of time to think of what you told me. You remember, Claire? Now I understand. I'm giving up this wandering around. I'm going to work. I'm going to settle down, I'm going to do everything you think I should. - Don't you think we'd better go now? Mathias will be waiting. - Claire. I'm going to do everything I should have done two years ago. I've learned my lesson. I'm never going to fly again. Are you glad, Claire? Don't say it's too late. And it's going all right. But you must stick by me. I must have someone, you understand. - You've been away a long time. - Don't answer now. I wouldn't expect you to decide your whole life at a moment's notice. But if you decide, you can find me in St. Pauli's Hotel. - Weather report from St. George, sir. Just come in. - Mm, looks rather bad for us, doesn't it? We ought to take on more water ballast. - Oh, it's not necessary. - What are we drawing now? - 120 feet. - If we're going to have a storm, we should take every precaution. - Yes, Lubin's right, we ought to be deep in the water. Take in another 50,000 tons. They're letting water into the float. - That means they want to lie deeper. And that means we're going to have a storm. - There you are, I told ya. She knows. - It's been tampered with. Someone's been taking an impression of that lock. - Aw, surely not. There's no one here who'd want to. - Oh isn't there? For two years they've left us alone. Now it begins again. - After all, out here... Suppose they smuggled one of their men on board. - Send the article's command room. I'll go over that list and account for everybody. - Right. - Flashlight. Hey! What are you doing down there? - I've just found something, food, water, and signal lights hidden away here. - I see. All ready for somebody to get away. Are these boats always guarded? - Yes, sir. I wonder if he could-- And it's about time, too. Yes, I've been watchin' ya. Always nosing around here. Look out, the Captain! - What's the matter? - Here. Who is this man? - They caught him rooting around in the engine room. - Haven't I seen you before? - Probably. I wasn't always a cleaner of door handles. Formerly I was a private photographer to Major Ellissen. The well-known aviator. - Yes. - Besides, Lubin and I are old friends. - What? - Oh, yes. You once kicked me out of the Lennartz Yard. I can't say that I like working with him very much. But I had to be on the spot to take the first photograph. - Oh, I see. You're the one that's been amusing himself with flashlights. - Yep. - From now on, confine your attention to door handles. - If I kick you out of the FP1, you won't come back again so easily. You ever heard of sharks? - Mr. Droste, the wireless operator has been taken ill. What? - Typical signs of poisoning. He must have swallowed something with scopolamine in it. - Mac. Mac. What have you been eating? What have you been eating? - In the canteen. Coffee. - Well, do the best you can, Doctor. We'd better keep it quiet. I'll be in the wireless room if you want me for anything. Right. Lubin, what are you doing here? - I've just taken over until the other operator arrives. - Never mind, never mind. - It's a bit warm in here. Funny business, isn't it? I was with the poor fellow in the canteen, only an hour ago. - Yes, the doctor didn't understand it at all. I wonder what's behind all this. Wasn't the transmitter working just now? - No, everything was quiet. - Well I heard something. I'm gonna send for a fresh crew. - If the call's late, we shall miss the first act of the opera. - Good. - What do you mean good? - Well, you never know your luck. - Hello. Am I late again? - Oh, no. Oh. - Oh. We've still got 20 minutes to spare. The shot-way won't be free till half past nine. - I tell you it's someone who's being paid to work against us. Some fool who thinks he can sink the FP1. - He can hardly sink it just by copying a key. - Not even the key to the? All he'd have to do is open the flood valves, fix the diesel so we couldn't close them again, and there's nothing to prevent the FP1 from filling. - Sinking, like a tin man with a hole in it. Droste, nonsense. You're trying to pull my leg. He can't be that much of a fool. He'd have to sink with it. - Not if he had a motorboat all prepared with food and drink and signal lights so that he could get away to sea and find a ship. Where's he going to find a ship? The Atlantic's a big place, Droste. - Well I'm not taking any chances. I'm going to close the flood valves at once. Who is this meant... - Keep quite still or I'll shoot. - Oh. So that's what you're gonna do, is it? - Come on, Droste. Give it up, there's nothing you can do. In 36 hours there won't be anything here but water, just as it was before Captain Droste had his great inspiration. - I see. That's why the wireless operator was off duty tonight. So that the message that was meant for you shouldn't get into anyone else's hands. So simple. By the way, Lubin, how much are they paying you? - More than I'd earn on your FP1 in 100 years. Come on, Droste, put up your hands! And stand up. Stand! - Hello, hello, Lennartz Shipyard calling. Hello, hello! - Droste! - Hello, Droste. - Droste! Droste! Don't you understand, it's Droste! No, it's. - Droste! - Darling. - Droste. Droste. Droste. - The FP1 doesn't answer. We'll send out an SOS. There must be a ship somewhere about. - You know we can't do that. - But why not? We've had all this out before. It would spoil everything if the public were alarmed just before the opening. - We must do something. If we can't send out an SOS, then we must send out a plane. Oh we must! - We can't! - We can, and I'm going with him. - Claire, you're making too much of this. There'll be some perfectly simple explanation if you'll only wait till morning. No one's going to fly halfway across the Atlantic at five minutes' notice. - In any case, you couldn't get a pilot at this time of night. - Oh yes I could. There's one I could get. - Yes? - There's a lady to see you. - Claire. I began to think you weren't coming and then... But you have come, Claire. - I want you to do something for me. - I'll do anything for you, you know that. Anything between heaven and earth. - I want you to take me to the FP1. I've got a plane ready. - Claire, why are you worrying about the FP1 now? - They're in great danger, Droste and everyone. - Is that why you came to me? - I've no one else to help me. - If I do fly, that means you're giving me my chance again? - Yes. - Look. - That's the FP1! Remember, I told you I'd be the first to land on it! If they asked me nicely. What's happened to everyone down there? - Aren't you going to land? - Of course. Are you all right? - Yes, I'm, I'm all right. - Fine. Hello! Let's go up. , huh? Gas. Uh huh. That's where it came from, sprinkler plan. - Droste! - Droste. Come on, tell us, what's the matter? Hmm? What's happened? Not so bad, no. It's not so bad. Water. I'll get water. Oh, my dear. My very dear, dear. Oh my dear. - Uh huh. Sunshine! What are you doing here? Hmm, that better? - Yes, thanks. - What's that? water running in the floats. - What for? - Just ballast. It's been running ever since last night. - We must stop it. Where's the control room? - 323. - Come on. - I believe it's here. - Well pull the door. It's closed. - Still coming in. There's no power. The flood valves can't be closed. - Our confidential man has completed his work. No messages have been sent out from the FP1 for the last 12 hours. - We may therefore rest assured that the FP1 is now a matter of past history. And our confidential man? - Was informed that the steamer Marshall Tennyson would pick him up. And the steamer Marshall Tennyson? - Was of course never sent out. - The flood valves have been open for nearly 23 hours. We've taken in 156,000 tons of water. - That means we can keep afloat for between 16 and 17 hours. Where's Ellissen? - I don't know, I think he's by the plane. - And what about the crew? - Another couple of hours, and we shall all have been done in. Aint that right? - The whole gunwale has been shot to pieces. - There isn't a drop of oil on board! - Quiet. You don't need to drown. Have you forgotten that Droste has supplied you with motorboats? The motorboats! No one is going to leave the FP1. The first man to make a move will be shot. - Let me pass. Put those guns away. - I'm in command here. - You were in command. But I didn't fly here to amuse myself. I flew here because I was told that human lives were in danger. And I'm going to see that those lives are saved! get in the boats! - Wait! Do you think I'll give up the FP1 like that? Never. There's nothing to be alarmed about. We can float until tomorrow morning. I'll send out the planes, they can pick up a ship. The propellors are smashed! The motorboats! - Well, aren't you going? I'm afraid I won't be able to escort you this time. - Ellissen! Why did you send those men away? Don't you realize there's nothing we now? - Certainly. And I'm very glad. In 12 hours we will have finished with everything. You and me and, we three. You who helped to start the FP1 will come to an end with it. I rather like that idea. If I have lived my life, just as soon die with it. - What's the matter with you, Ellissen? - Claire knows what's the matter with me. I will leave her to explain it. Call me when we start to sink. I don't want to miss the end of Droste's FP1. - We must try and fix up one machine with what parts we can find. Let's get to work, I want to leave at sunrise. - All right, ready? - Yeah, yeah. Right, up! Up! Up! It's your move, go on. - Check. What's the matter? Are you worrying about your precious life? Things are getting a bit warm, aren't they? - Yes, they are. - What are you doing? Get out! Get out! Leave me alone. - You oughta be thankful you don't have to go up in this plane. - No one'll go up in that. It's only a few spare parts tied together with string. Do you know the only way to get that to go up? Blow it up with gunpowder. - There are only 15 and a half gallons of petrol in Major Ellissen's plane. - 15 and a half gallons? Well I can get a fair distance on that. - Then put it in this one. - What a good story. Whilst the FP1 is sinking, Major Ellissen, the once-famous airman, allows his friend Droste, with a broken shoulder, to attempt the flight. It'll make a marvelous picture. - He won't start in that machine! No one could! No one with any sense would attempt it! - You know more about airplanes than all the rest of them put together. Why don't you help Droste? - I'm sick of Droste and you and everyone. I'd have done anything for Droste, but he was to clever for me. He's been playing his own game. And for that, everything that meant anything in my life has gone. He's just been fooling me. They have all been fooling me. - That isn't true. When I came to you the other night and asked you to save the FP1, I almost told you the truth. - What is the truth? - That I love Droste. I'd make any conditions you like. You can let Droste attempt this flight, even though you know he hasn't got a chance, or... Oh well, we're entirely in your hands. It seems you are in command, after all. I'm going, Claire. I've come to say goodbye. - Oh, please. Please don't go just yet. I want to talk to you first. - And why now? We can talk about it when I get back. Oh I can't let you fly, I can't. - Listen, Claire, listen. I've got to go, don't you understand? I've got to find a ship with enough oil to start the diesels and close the flood valves. It's our only chance. - Yes, but, please, please don't go just yet. I must talk to you now. - You really imagine you can make that thing fly? Look at the fuselage! It's not properly braced. The controls are all flabby. You'd better put this in a museum. That's a funny-looking key. There's no pressure. * Da da da dee Just give the prop a twist. Contact! There you are, I told you it was no good. Not one kick in her. - Oh, don't be unhappy about it, Claire. It really doesn't matter. I'll be back in a few hours and... Bye. - Let her roll! Airplane on the port quarter! - You must tell, ready for the diesels. What sort of a boat is this anyway? And where are you going? - We're bound for Chile, to hunt condors. - What? My dear good fellow, you won't find condors in Chile. You must go up to Peru. But even there, you won't find them alone. Without me. And I'll go with you. I have plenty of time now. I'll show you the way. If you ask me nicely.
