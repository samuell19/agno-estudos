Present with support from in association with. IN PRAISE OF NOTHING a whistleblowing documentary parody not exactly in prose wherein Nothing tries to defend its cause. [One day, Nothing runs away from home, tired of being misunderstood.] [It crosses 8 mountains and 8 seasâ€¦ ...[and arrives in our lost valley.] Finally- our first date. Not sure if I came early or late. I've got so much to tell you but I'm still wondering how. I don't wanna suck up to you nor make you bow. There has never been a less exciting time to be behind a camera, on that I agree, so let's set up this game a little bit differently. We will skip talking heads and expert analysis, special effects and cultural paralysis. No classic twists, no money shots, no side characters, no subplots. No saving the world, no noble pretentions, just portraits of you and me in everyday situations. And a few lines of comments to frame the debate, just to make sure that you will bite the bait. [Nothing slides down a blank page and descends among us.] But who am I to say "I" or "we"? Am I really Nothing or just my ego's mercenary? They say I can only be hinted at and never shown unlike any other thing currently unknown. But I am actually there in every shot. If you bother to find me. If you don't, imagine that what you see is what I see. Or just enjoy the scenery and let your mind roam freely. And don't worry - I certainly won't take it personally. [Nothing adjusts its belt.] I know I shouldn't start my sentences with "I" and they warned me not to ask too much "why" but I think it's nice to be an "I" who asks "why" so I will try. I came from God knows where but I too now want everything quickly. Can't believe I'm losing my patience after being used to eternity. Seems like I've caught a typical local malady - some strange sense of entitlement has gotten hold of me. I suddenly feel I deserve more than I deserved previously and I get bothered so easily, even my brand new self-image is ashamed of me. I don't flinch at global misery but I get disturbed significantly by a stray bee that invades my privacy. By a fat person that dares to walk in front of me. By unsupervised children playing loudly. By dishes that don't wash themselves instantly. By a telephone that rings persistently. By the size of my best friend's salary. By the slightest awareness of my own hypocrisy... I don't know how to deal with this, I hope that it's just temporary. I almost wish that someone had warned me, but I guess that would have spoiled the wisdom of discovery. [Nothing admits its knowledge of our world used to be exactly opposite to ours.] All I knew about love was from letters that were never sent. All I knew about faith was from scavenging leftovers of dissent. All I knew about you was from things that you didn't do. The words you never said. The books you never read. The ideas you never picked up. The possibilities you never knew. Now I see I have a lot to catch up. Don't you? [We don't - and Nothing starts to feel rather unwelcome.] I feel stalked. I feel like a Stalker. I wanted to help, but you are boycotting my offer. Confusion, depression, emptiness, delusion, obsession, loneliness... You are wrong to accuse me for every line in your psychiatric history. Sorry, there's no shortcut out of purgatory. No V.I.P., no duty-free, no return policy, no money-back guarantee - Just a few lucky stars and your own personal gravity. Cruising altitude is a mirage, the battle rages on, whatever the paysage. So don't blame me when things get hard, all I am doing is letting you play in my backyard. [Nothing is starting to get judgmental.] I understand that it is hard to live either with or without opinions, alone among billions, on a tiny star surrounded by trillions. All your hopes of persisting and transcending end up in anti-climactic forgetting. All your efforts to leave a mark become at best someone else's spark. Realizing how small and insignificant you are cannot be compensated by the size of your car, a big tab at the bar, a sexy avatar, a smashed guitar or one last cigar. All I know is that you are afraid, that your parking is paid, that you want to get laid, and that beyond this your brain is marmalade. [The truth is that Nothing is just as confused as we are, but it eventually succeeds at grasping human nature.] Live a balanced depression. Consume your fate. Do what you're told to like. Don't be late. Blend your virtues and sins. Insure your rise and fall. Hang on to your future and broadcast it all. [Yet Nothing remains sympathetic to our weaknesses, and even adopts a few on its own.] I like sweating. I like doubting. I like cabaret. I like tabouleh. I like worn out shoes. I like prison blues. I like rakija more than wine. I like beauty. Not necessarily great beauty, medium is fine. And I have only one thing to say to History: The question is not how can there be poetry after Holocausts, but how can there be Holocausts after poetry?! [Inspired, Nothing tries to adapt, but things don't go so smoothly.] I slid into a lake which was perfectly quiet, but they kicked me out because all the lakes are now private. I forged a bicycle path across a new scenery but I crashed miserably when I tried to do it hands free. I decided to travel light but I ran out of clean underwear the very first night. I endured pain in front of my buddies but the girl went for the one with more monies. I reminded friends of things that were free but they turned each of them into a profitable industry. I wanted to help people anonymously but the cops shot at me. I tried to do everything and then something and then anything but it's hard to succeed when you are Nothing. [Yet Nothing feels too proud to go on welfare.] I think I am the ideal candidate for this job because... I feel like a contemporary of all the great minds in history and a resident of the most photogenic places on earth. I think good and evil can't exist without each other, and change, even small change is what keeps our minds and economies squirt. I have no future, no past, no friends and no money but I'm paying for your virtues and your attempts to be funny. I am great at managing time and I can always jump in when someone forgets their line. Team work is my specialty - the greater the challenge, the more you can count on me. I'm willing to relocate much more than you can anticipate and I will outdate even your youngest candidate. I'm persistent, resistant, always available, malleable, reliable, never failable - I even know how the world will end and... everything else that you couldn't have planned. [No replies.] I stole a tomato from a field in Italy and it still tasted like shit. In prison I tamed an ant but nobody could see it. I meditated for 62 years but not a tourist would tip. I tried not to care about the competition but ends-of-months made me flip. I shared all my possessions until the white men said stop. I empathized with nature but birds and bugs ate my crop. I lived up to what I believed in until I broke bad. I spent all my life doing good then I became mad. [For reasons not apprehendable to Man, Nothing keeps talking in rhyme, all the time.] Not to be or to be? Why bother in all this banality? "If" is a space. "Why" is time. When you are happy or dead neither is worth a dime. If pictures create memories, what does a surplus of pictures create? The future of shopping will not be to buy but to eliminate. When your wife and kids want something more than a full stomach take away something they already have then give it back. The most elegant gesture of the human body is the act of refraining from action. The most elegant gesture of the human mind is avoiding distraction. What do you mean - I shouldn't talk, shouldn't formalize? Shouldn't suggest answers, shouldn't verbalize? Too easy. Insist on any armimal or tree and get philosophy? Make any shot too lengthy and get poetry?! Fit your screenplay on a napkin and claim humility?! Film simple people uncritically and redeem modernity?? Fuck that, baby. We're beyond that. Maybe. OK, I agree. Maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm just a sarcastic old fuck and life is as sweet as you would like it to be. [Soon after, of course, Nothing falls in love.] Throw me a glove, cry me a dove, earthly love is impossible love. Particles and anti-particles keep cancelling each other. Why would then men & women bother? Can't live with each other, can't do without, cool off or burn out. Your children will sell you for a faster telephone. Your parents, for the right to be alone. Your partner, for a new hormone. You like strawberry, she likes quantumberry. She wants to marry, you want Tom & Jerry. Faithful or not, always an idiot. The casting rarely matches the plot. [Nothing's promiscuity draws international attention. Americans spend a fortune trying to buy Nothing:] "Listen," we know you're right but we can't let you win. Come work for us and become the ultimate sin. Our policy is simple: Decide & conquer. We don't even hide it, we are raw power. Your job will be to generate fear so that demand always beats supply at the end of the year. In the meantime, we'll bullet-proof the boutique, assimilate all critique, spread freedom with our armed forces, trade entertainment for natural resources and blackmail the world with paper value "until the last patch of our lies becomes true." To this I replied with the following defence: Thank you, dear friends, you are my favorite clients. But in your Disneyland of the free, allow me to disagree - You are too fat to fit my glass menagerie. What you are imposing on your subjects is a wrong therapy - charging them for the placebo that is. - Money. OK, the pills and thrills and frills but life shouldn't be printed on fake dollar bills. People would love to try your dream but only at their own steam. Work to live, not live to work. Press pause, smell the cork. There's nothing scary on a blank wall nor in living life without a lucrative goal. And talking about fear - you're the ones who should play the main role. At the rate at which you suck everything in, you are this planet's black hole. [Asians try to clone Nothing:] "Listen," you're one of us and you've always been. We were the first to treat you as our next of kin. Numbers always work out to our advantage, nevermind our limited sleeping mileage. We make up one half of the planet, just wait 'til we all discover the internet. We have 99 ideograms for Nothing and 69 holograms for vagina, even the Emperor's new clothes are now made in China. Let us mass-produce you with our 12D printers, with special pricing for early-bird hipsters. Too late now to erase the ego - "now it must be pleased or face vertigo." To this I replied with the following defence: Thank you numerous friends, I owe you my licence. I understand my position is central to your being but you know that on an absolute level I neither oppose nor support anything. I appreciate the elegance of your calligraphy, the spirituality of your tea ceremony, the negative space in your painting, your meditations on the verge of fainting, your practical tips about breathing, your casual flirting with non-being... But with all due respect to your might, just because you can do everything doesn't mean that you are right. What you need, I think, is to practice Kama Sutra in a version that's a bit more platonic. Unite with the cosmos in any single pixel but sustain your lust against every daily tickle. Learn to let go off your omnipotence. Take seriously your vow of balance. And if other powers want to make you sway, don't worry. Bruce Lee is alive and he's on his way. [Arabs try to re-tame Nothing:] "Listen," you know that we are right, no need to wait for the thousand and first night. We invented coffee, clean shave and algebra and even what would later become your camera. We also saved the classical knowledge of Antiquity and gave prominent importance to the notion of virginity. We've been both cursed and blessed by nature, this always results in an unpredictable mixture. There's no money now that we cannot spend. Our goal is to create life out of sand. Welcome to our big traditional family. "You'll be treated as our newest common luxury." To this I replied with the following defence: Thank you honorable friends, I admire your persistence. Conjure me from a lamp, anytime you need my stamp. History has not treated you gently but you are also stretching time vigorously. You gained my sympathy by surviving in harsh conditions but kinda disappointed me with your current positions. I don't think you should impose your point of view, neither upon the desert nor upon the likes of you. Feel free to advertise your alchemy but don't take anyone else's for blasphemy. People won't accept fasting unless you call it detox - promises of heaven are already clogging up their mailbox. I wish you happy existential battles in your sand and gold castles. For anything else, God have mercy, but the final bill is on me. [Europeans are still discussing what to do with Nothing:] "Listen," let's first agree that we need to set up a special committee. Such a critical development deserves outmost consideration - it requires the consent of our entire dysfunctional confederation. We must establish a proper explanatory framework for this question, otherwise our policy will remain just a vain suggestion. Our goal is that everyone feels they have gained something "but that we, of course, remain on top of everything." To this I replied with the following defence: Thank you old friends, cheers to your eloquence. You speak most fluently but your verbal masturbation fails me. Dozens of alleged winners and no proclaimed losers, seems like you're jumping into very tight trousers. I didn't really get your proposal but I see your frustrations. Futility should be the subject of your next strikes and demonstrations. Condemned to be free but fearing the freedom of others. Imitating obnoxiously your enemies and mothers... Your noble arrogance doesn't do it for me - only tourists can be fooled by your complex of superiority. Each nation can be proud of fragments of its history but none of its entirety. And even fewer should claim any monopoly on morality. Your reluctance to assimilate me is in fact a key syndrome of your drudgery. Adopt me or become your own failed colony. [The rest of world believes Nothing can help them:] "Listen," we have nothing to offer you, we just do what we are told to. Paper-wall democracy and profits for the few - they convince you grindingly that it's good for you. Sometimes, if we are particularly good, they clean our files and gentrify our mood. They insist we're not screwed when they hybridize our food and dismiss our proud beliefs as a mere historical interlude. Deep inside we know we're nat so autistic but our reply to this is either agnostic or fatalistic. We feel that we know you and that we can trust you - "please advise us, what should we do?" To this I replied with the following stance: Well, global friends, it is time to make amends. Never mind the size of your shoes - if you want to win, you must not lose. If you don't sacrifice yourself no one will, kicking history between the legs requires no special skill. We're all intelligent in different ways, there are infinite possibilities to get out of this maze. Defend your territory, both mental and physical, all it takes is a few authentic, non-CIA heroes to set the example. If that's not exactly you, here's what else you could do: Don't give them what they want to hear - just ignore them when they come near. Don't even bother to challenge their prejudice, even acknowledging it would make you their accomplice. Over time they will choose weaker nuts to crack - resist radically and never turn back. [A Russian poet then came to the edge of the world and spat at Nothing.] That was actually... nice! Thanks twice. Now I see the power of your brand and that it is actually possible to make a stand. Skip auditions - dodge tuitions - discard permissions - shortcut ignitions - ignore definitions - praise intuitions - invoke contradictions - embrace oppositions - and do keep your receipts - One day I will really wash all this scum off the streets. From now on, every thought must be tight. It will be 20 tautologies and 30 euphemisms every night. Myth-busting for the shy & quiet - an instant new post-ideological diet. A smart cold digital heart. Empathy - only a la carte. You're talking to me? [Once again, Nothing's noble threats get very little attention.] Is it me you're talking to?! Time is shrinking, the angels are drinking, the Gods stopped playing punishment & crime. Tom Waits is retiring, deadlines are expiring, for no one the bells chime. No matter how you feel touche, all I say will one day be cliche. No matter how sleazy, we will always look up to the bourgeoisie. And the wind of the north, freezes my snort. And the wind from the south, blows sand in my mouth. And the wind from the west, failed the drug test. And the wind from the east, I caught but I missed. [Desperate, Nothing starts a blog on tactical pauses during sexual intercourse.] These were actually just notes from my diary but someone took them very explicitly. Curved geometry remains a mystery unless you study the matter a bit more deeply. The intensity of the celebration is directly proportional to the period of abstinence and stimulation. The pauses between the notes is what earned me the most votes. Your preferences they are like mine, I heard it through the grapevine. Me. You. Library. Now? Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! [But all it took for Nothing's popularity to explode was one explicit selfie.] [Success, though, comes at a price.] Being famous and bitter is worse than becoming revolutionary litter. I got trapped in my own curse - I kept bullshitting, but it filled my purse. Vomiting my rhymes as the agents advised - Enough now? We got prized. Starring in docu-soaps about fallen prophets, baptizing galaxies, comets and rockets, Giving silent motivational speeches, bleaching sand on polluted beaches. Claiming copyright on creativity in general, on zero and infinity and all things ephemeral. Getting filthy rich on apparitions of Nothing - coining notoriously: "Why something" instead of... "anything?" [Despising itself more and more, Nothing tries at least to be useful.] Ha! Indulgence is very cheap these days but I have always preferred my own ways: Recycling the energy of fallen enthusiasts - Licking the wounds of broken iconoclasts - Granting sinners essential silence - Fine-tuning your work-and-family balance - Extending, then shortening waiting times - Teaching people tricks for queuing in lines - Making them lose what they would later find - helping them see before they go blind - Discouraging kids from surplus toys - Abolishing logos and violent joys - Insuring talents against jury decisions - Macheting the jungle to clear space for their visions - Turning philosophical when people ask for direction - Crisis-managing death to near-perfaction. Pointing inside your playboy gaze - Enamoring you, without the self-praise - Making you check twice before you click SEND - Stopping movies 10 minutes before they end - Mixing up price tags of riches and. [Too late. The industry has got Nothing by the balls.] "Mr. Nothing! Mr. Nothing!" "Can you describe a perfectly empty room?" "Is old too old?" "Do you have a personal opinion on top of the corporate one?" "You claim you came into being like everyone else -" by love or misunderstanding. "What did you mean by 'love'?" "You refuse to answer where you are coming from and whether you exist at all. Can we call you an 'ontological nationalist'?" "What do you think of the phrase: 'We will sleep together one day, but not tonight?'" "We're making a festival of silence - will you come?" "Could you confirm that there's Nothing after death?" "Is cheap humor the biggest threat to humanity?" "Do you have a tattoo?" [At the height of its popularity, Nothing decides to step down.] Ho, ho, ho! So, so, so! It's hunting season on the albatross - Time for me to toss my cross. A big day today, mathematics are finally swinging my way. I have proven to myself that my opposite is possible and that the two are actually compatible. Everything and Nothing converge in a vanishing point which is itself another starting point. How's that for a borderline checkpoint?! Philosophers, priests, scientists, astronauts, I challenge you to a duel down in the footnotes. You "saved" the world so mary times it has grown immune, restoring it right is costing me a fortune. If this will make your lives more bearable, I can officially proclaim that quality, passion, curiosity, consciousness, and chocolate crises are NOT sustainable, I will also stop subsidizing forgetting, lying, crying, betting, petting, fleeing, and any other 'necessary being'. I further renounce on the idea of my own contingency and on the contingency of reality itself. If you don't know what that means, lucky you, you're one happy little self. [Nothing gives a farewell speech.] Thank you for your hospitality, ladies and gentlemen, I have to go now, though I have no other plan. I have learned so much from you over this weekend that I couldn't have hoped for more. Please excuse me now, I have other worlds to explore. More than anything, I will miss my first piss and our last kiss. That's it now. Nothing phone home. I'm leaving you as I came, without a big splash, taking with me a single thing - unstained - and that is... and that is... my moustache. [But Nothing finds no home to go back to, so it pretends to have a few more things to say.] Did I just dream that I am you or did you imagine that you are me? Was this my or your biography? I wish I could forget again what you know and re-learn what you don't but the fog of experience has blurred that battlefront. A perfect man is inefficient - A faulty Nothing is insufficient. I see now that I don't fit neither here nor there, nor for that matter - anywhere. A baroque minimalist - a cynical optimist - a gentle sadist - an approximate perfectionist - Pick any contradiction from the list... If I have tried to run away from myself, I have failed. If I came to pose on your cross, I never got nailed. But I have no regrets whatsoever and no further plan for I have been both Nothing and for a while, a Man. I tried manhood, now you try nothingness. Embrace it daily like a trendy new fitness. [The takeaway, if any.] Actually, there's no real conclusion to what I had to say. It's more about what went through your mind along the way. I give you back now the mystery of life. I'll be fine with the angel's share and my next wife. And falling asleep in cinemas, on books and under trees, hypnotizing traffic cops into waiving your fees. Helping bicycle passengers keep that smile on their face; Making kids accelerate the last few steps to your embrace. Adding echoes and reverbs to your inner gospel choirs, Feeling nostalgic of Buenos Aires even in Buenos Aires. And provoking life in detail and in full; Hiding in your pocket, like s Swiss-army tool. Discarding warnings that principles are irresponsible; Speaking in verse just to prove that it's possible. Indulging in art without trying to be smart. Rhyming, for example, "fart" and "fresh start". Understanding, finally, my epitaph and legacy: STAND ON THE SHOULDERS OF NOTHING AND EVERYTHING THAT COULD BE I'm not sure if there's a Japanese word for this. There probably must be.
