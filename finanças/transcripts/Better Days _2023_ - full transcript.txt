No, we need to start earlier. It was his birthday, so I let him sleep in. Maybe I should explain the whole angel thing, because I hated costumes. The only reason I wore it that morning was-- was for him. You see, we-- we, uh, we met at a Halloween party in Toronto when I was 22. Uh, I had a friend who invited me to this party and she had a double costume. So I went as an angel and there I was hiding in the corner. I hate parties. It was a very noisy party. And, uh, this giant pink bunny came over, actually hopped over. It was love at first sight. Me and my bunny together forever. Happy birthday. You get cake for breakfast. I'm also wearing the angel costume if you want a little action with a celestial being. I've always been the Beats Me School of Religion. What happens when we die? Beats me, I guess find out when it happens. But he seems so alone in there. Just suit and shoes. What if he needed to bribe someone to get in? Sorry, honey. Show time. Thank you. Thank you so much for coming. The funeral was lovely. A perfect tribute to how much his life really mattered. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! If all you can do is go on about, "Oh, my God. It's been ages. Amy, Tom. Oh, how are you? I'm going on a trip. Really? How fabulous. Love your hair. Love your hair." Shut the fuck up! My husband is dead. Get the fuck outta here. I didn't say that. I only thought it. There you are, Kate. Everyone's wondering where you went. Hmm. Oh, yeah. I hate funeral receptions too. And you don't even drink. Might wanna start. It is damn hard, huh? Well, at least he went in his sleep. You don't wanna know how my cat Pickle suffered. You know, between you and me, I could use a day like today. I mean, everyone's saying Jenna was the kindest, most unselfish woman I ever met. And you know the worst thing about sleeping with a married man? Everyone gets to come to these things with someone, but I'm always by myself. I'm-- funerals, weddings, dinner parties. Like goddamn Noah's Ark out there. Maybe you'll find out for yourself. Oh, at least you'll have me to keep your company. Yeah. You got-- I'm gonna be checking up on you all the time. Hmm? I thought it was really nice. Yeah. Yeah. I know today was hard, but there'll be better days ahead, huh? We'll help you with anything. Packing his clothes. Those Halloween costumes, sis. Every year you'd be like... "We are the grownups Eric!" I guess you'll be selling the house, huh? Uh, well, I love this house. Why would she move? Well, she doesn't need all this space now. - This is our home. - Yeah. You're gonna take care of the yard, Leah? This is insane. Just because dad isn't here doesn't mean everything has to change. Mom you'll be much happier in a condo, okay? -there's no snow to shovel-- -Oh, my God. Don't tell her what to do. Like, she's staying right here. What you talking about? You're gonna-- you're gonna-- No, no, no, no, no, no. Come on, guys. Come on. It's been a long day. I'm fine. I'm fine. Okay? Go on. Go home. -Are you sure? -Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Okay. Will you call if you need anything? -Yeah. -Yeah? -Yeah. Yeah. -Alright. -Okay. -We'll see you really soon. -Yeah. Love you. -Love you. Love you too. You'll be alright. Mm. Oh. Oh... Please stop leaving messages. Uh, Kate? Uh, I-- I did leave messages, yeah. A-- about 20 of them. We were wondering-- I mean, I know it's a really hard time for you, but we thought you were going to come back two weeks ago and then last week and... it's-- it's Monday again. So we were thinking we might have to hire another lecturer for your classes. I-- I mean, on a more permanent basis. Is that what you want us to do? Sure. Oh, uh, well, it's your choice. Okay. Well, bye I guess. And-- and you take care. The one good thing about death... is life insurance. It's-- it's hard not to think, woohoo. What a-- what a load of cash. I mean, it was the biggest lump sum I'd ever had. And thanks to mortgage insurance, the house was entirely paid for. I didn't know it was enough for me to last forever. But... maybe. Depending on when you die. So possibly forever. 'Cause you can die at any point, right? Hello? Eric? If you speak, it would officially be a miracle. And I know there aren't a lot of those, but I could really-- I could really use a miracle. I miss you, honey. Hello? How about you, God? Can you hear me? I didn't think so. Hello, stranger. I thought I locked the door. I called and called and you didn't call back so I just told myself, "Why don't you just pop by?" I mean, I thought we'd be hanging out all the time now you're on your lone some, right? Things are same old same old with Ralph so I got plenty of time. Oh, what you got there? Something yummy? It's a lot of booze for someone who doesn't drink. You having a party I didn't get invited to? Uh, no. Actually there's a vodka shortage, you know, potato blight, famine. -Really? -Yeah. The Irish are really worried. Oh, bet you're still finding it hard without Eric, hey? I want you to know that we all miss him as much as you do. You-- you miss my husband as much as I do? Yeah. What a stupid thing to say. I miss him every second and I wanna die. And at the same time I think, oh God, I'm gonna die. We're all gonna die. You are gonna die! We're all gonna die. But we just pretend, oh no, everything's just fine, don't we? Don't we? Because, I mean, if there was a beast, a giant beast, right? From another planet that was coming down here to kill us all, we'd be running around screaming, or fucking, or... killing our enemies, right? But because it's going to be a car accident, or cancer or COVID, we just pretend everything is just fine! You are gonna die! You're gonna die. Yeah. It's-- it's nice for you to come, Jenna, but I'm, uh, kinda busy right now. Well, surely the cure for grief is not small talk. -You are? -Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, I guess I'll just s-- see myself out. So how you doing, mom? I'm fine. Would anyone like more wine? Uh, yeah, please. Thank you. And another cup of tea for you, Kate? No, no. I have enough tea. Thank you. Thank you. Chandni cooked dinner and, uh, she made extra - for you to take home. - To save you cooking. You didn't have to do that. I-- I'm sorry that we couldn't get together sooner. It's been, what? Weeks. - Work. - Exactly. Oh, speaking of work. How's it feel to be back teaching? It's-- it's not too much for you? No, no, no, no. It's not too much. That's great. That's really great. It's good to keep busy. It keeps your mind off things. "Things." How's Jenna? You two must be hanging out a lot more now. I know she can be a little... -Woo! But she's fun. -She is. Yeah, we saw each other the other day. I'm so glad. Well, Mom, I just wanna say, you know, I-- I know you still got your career and all for a while, but because you and Dad were so close, we just-- we're still worried. Because you know how with some couples when one of them... then the other one also sort of-- When my boss's wife died, he started drinking... a lot. -Oh... -Mm-hmm. But we're so glad that you're keeping it together. Being strong. - Dad would be really proud. - Mm-hmm. Would he? If I had died, would I have wanted him to get over me? Lickety-split. Who wants to be forgettable? And what-- what is the appropriate amount of grief? Is it like a multi-variable equation? Number of years together? Degree of happiness, shock? I'll admit I was not at my best. I just needed some time to adjust. A few weeks. Months. You know having this break has been really great. I-I don't miss teaching at all. I mean, when was the last time in my life when I could do whatever I wanted, right? Like drink vodka in the middle of the afternoon. You want some? Hey? Uh, no, no. Don't you go. I can get this. Here we go. Ooh! Hey. Uh, no problem. They're heavy. Thank you. Just put 'em-- Yeah. Thank you. Uh, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. Opposable thumbs. What would we do without them? And you, uh, would rule the world, Miss Ellicott. -Me? -Yeah. Well, I mean, without opposable thumbs humans would've never conquered the other species. No guns for a start. So I guess bears would be in charge. Right. I bet the planet would be a much better place. Can't get much worse. Bye. Bye. Um, I'll bring you some honey next time. -Did I-- did I order honey? -'Cause of the... Oh. He was so sweet. Acted like I was a real bear. Did you miss me? Hey, did you miss me? Hey, you missed me. I know you did. I know you did. I know you did. Ah, hmm. Hmm. Isn't that what we all want? Is to love someone so much that we'd go mad without them? Talk to me, please! Talk to me! Okay. Maybe I needed some new friends. Real friends. As in not imaginary. You can see why Miss Ellicott is my favorite customer. I love these. I can't believe you have them. Yeah, we just saved our favorite costumes over the years. Thank you for letting us try them on. My pleasure. Okay, so we all believe in dogs and roosters, but who believes in angels? -I do. -I don't know. And if there are angels, are they here around us? We just don't see them? People who are dead but lingering. That's ghosts. I don't believe in ghosts. You don't? Definitely not. But the angels maybe. So we become angels when we die, but we're not here on earth. We're up in heaven hanging out with our dead friends and families. Bouncing up and down in the clouds. - Sounds nice. - Yeah. Do we still have food in heaven? -I don't know. -Nobody knows. Nobody. Geez. I wouldn't want to give up tacos. Human beings can't know what happens after we die. Because if it's nice, then whenever we have a bad day, we'd just kill ourselves to get up there sooner. But there's always a better day ahead. You just gotta wait for it. Your age. But what happens when all you have ahead of you is getting useless and then your brain shrivels up and you have to wear diapers and then you have to be tied to a chair so you don't run away from that horrible nursing home they put you into. Maybe years before you actually get to die. Okay. So what happens to your loved ones while they're waiting for you? Maybe they met somebody nice. Forgot about you, and then you show up and they go, "Get lost. I'm dating Elizabeth Taylor." And then you have to spend eternity all alone. Eternity. Who's Elizabeth Taylor? Shit! -Hide me, hide me. -Oh, I can do it. Oh. No, no. It's okay. It's not gonna work. It's okay. Hey. Wow. What a lovely surprise, Jenna. Well, I just thought it'd come by and say hi. I have, uh, guests right now, as you can see. Uh... I-- I-- I know eating alone sometimes it doesn't seem worth the trouble so I brought you a casserole. Oh wow. Thank you. Yeah, I would, uh, I would invite you, -but-- -Yeah, no, it's okay. Sure. I-- I-- I understand. Okay. Just keep in touch. Okay? -Really. -Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. A casserole? I can't believe people are bringing you free food. -That is awesome. -Yeah. Aww. And it smells good. I shall heat it up. Oh, yes! They were sweet. And to them I wasn't the "Widow." -Ta-da! -Wow. So cool. You are so cool, man. I love it. Looks good on you. What is this? Uh, I think it's a chipmunk or skunk. I don't-- yeah. Should have worn that to prom. -Oh, there's a bridal gown. -Oh, no, no, no. That's not a co-- costume. Well, maybe it is. This is your actual wedding gown? Yeah. Yeah. We didn't wanna ask, but where is your husband? Oh, he left me. Well, he did. You're so lucky he left his costumes behind. Yeah. I don't think he needed them where he was going. Where was that? -Spain. -Oh. Don't worry you'll get over him. Men come, they go. But we survive. -Up top. -All right. You can know you're pathetic but still not wanna have people feel sorry for you. Mom? Use your key. What are you doing? Just give me a second. Oh! Night night. -There you are. -Hey. -Jenna called me. -Oh. Yeah. Mom, who are these kids you let in? And they're wearing those wacky costumes of dads? I thought you threw those out ages ago. Oh no. Not, not yet. No. Okay. Well, mom, you can't just let strangers into the house. People often target women your age. All right? Widows. They take advantage. -They were just-- -Woah. -Have-- have you been drinking? -You never drink. You have always said you don't like feeling all woozy. I don't get it. You were just doing so well. -She was doing so well. -Yeah. Well, I guess we haven't visited in quite a while. -Well, I'm swamped at work. -I-- Oh, you're swamped. Like, give me a fucking break. No, it was just a little sip to help me sleep. It hit me hard 'cause I'm not a drinker and they were just little children. Little children. -What do we do here? -I don't know. -Pretty small. -Maybe you should take her to your place for the night. Well, I've got people coming for dinner, so I can't. Take her to yours. I got a date. My apartment's so small. You gotta-- There's no way you have a date. Why does that matter? What she-- Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? I won't see them again, the little children. I promise. Cross my heart Something at least that-- Yeah, I mean, I guess it's true. She's not a drinker. So one glass of wine would really hit her. Yeah. Yeah. You got it. Yeah, for sure. It's amazing. I mean, it was Jenna who called, so. Oh, Jenna talking about, you know, drink or-- Just some little kids having fun with the costumes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. -Okay. So we're okay? -Yeah. It's a bit funny. But do you, uh, might wanna just take it easy with the alcohol, Mom. Keep it to one glass of wine. Um, if she's all right, I really gotta get going here. Yeah. Honestly, me too. Chandni is pissed about always doing the cooking, so. But you're really okay? I'm fine. I'm fine. You know, you're not too lonely? I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Just remember, you know, don't see those kids again. Oh, pfft. You got it. You bet. My mom would never wear something like this in public. Mine too. I mean, she's been dead for ages, but still. My mom has so many rules. I'm sick of everyone telling me what to do. Yes. I'll clean my room tomorrow. Right? I'll take out the garbage later. I know I haven't returned your damn casserole dish. You'll never get into a good school with those grates. You wanna be a delivery boy for the rest of your life? File those tax returns on time. Don't drop out of another school. No one will hire you with a tattoo on your face. I will decide who you can be friends with and what you can drink. You're gonna regret this when you're older. You're gonna regret everything anyway. You're gonna regret not loving people enough and not hugging them all night long and not telling them how wonderful they were every minute of every day. And then... I should just hold onto them tight and have a whole bunch more sex. Lots and lots and lots of sex. Because once it's gone, you miss it. So when you can, you should just fuck and fuck and fuck and fuck! I mean, it's true. It's just-- it's-- it's true. And it's all regret, right? That's life. Regret. And there's nothing you can do about it. Uh... I-- I gotta go. Bye. Okay. Uh, see you soon? Uh, I got-- I have some things I need to do so you guys just hang out without me for a while, okay? Don't you need your costumes back? You can keep 'em. Enjoy. Oh. You'll not believe the day I'm having. Well, that nightie's a bit Handmaid's Tale, don't you think? I'm sorry, it was one of those costumes. Do you sleep in it? Anyway, I have news. Marigold died. -Your goldfish? -No, Ralph's wife. Maggie told me. Do you know Maggie? No, you know Maggie. She knows. Alma knows. Marigold's sister. -They think it was a stroke. -Oh. What do I do? About what? Do I call? Sorry, you're going to bed. I-- I could use a drink. Okay. I mean, he told me never to call, but that was because Marigold might be there, which obviously. You were getting me a drink. What do I say when I call him? What do I-- do I say sorry? It doesn't seem right. Why hasn't he called? It happened this morning. Her face just fell flat in her ex. I have cookies. Cookies... Wow. Oh, they look wonderful. -He should call me, right? -Shit! I forgot to have a last meal. What do you think is the hardest thing to give up? Chocolate. Are we talking about dieting? Look at you. Well, Marigold compared to her. I'm one of those sister super models with the bony bits and the cheekbones and the singer boyfriends. Oh, God, the woman's dead. I shouldn't criticize. Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. Chocolate's fine. I-- I just really prefer alcohol. Do you have any? Oh, of course I have alcohol. Oh, right! You got that stash because of the potato famine. I can still move. What are we looking for? A glass. What? I can't hear you. What? I have this whooshing sound in my ear. It's like a No, actually it's slower. It's like A glass. You're getting me a glass. Yes. Ah. Here they are. Wow. Hello glasses. Yeah, I could text him, but texting someone to say, "Hey, I hear your wife is dead." I mean, that just doesn't seem right. Is it getting dark in here? Oh, I feel so sleepy. Oh. Oh. I better, uh, lie down. Oh, I know it's late, but just please don't let me drink alone. It always makes me feel like a bad girl -and not in a good way. -I will join you. A drink, it might help things along. Okay. Oh, my arm... feels kind of heavy in a pleasant way. Oh. Oh, okay. Looks like you've already had a few drinks. No. No. Well, maybe it depends on the timeframe. Why don't we just take this to the couch? Checking all the funeral homes. Do you think I'll be invited to the funeral? I should be. That way I get to meet his kids. I mean, you know, gradually. Like, "This is an employee I invited to your mom's funeral." But then, "This is a friend that brings casseroles because I'm a widower." And then, "This is your new mom." I'm gonna be rich. I-- this is the first time, I swear, -I've never thought about it. -Mm-hmm. But-- rich. Me. I mean, I suppose I should quit, right? I mean, the new Mrs. Ralph can't be office manager of one of his dental clinics. I mean, I should probably stay at home. Oh, what a home! I mean, I've never been inside, but I've driven past quite a few times. I'm gonna live in a house with pillars. You know, maybe we should move, right? I mean, there'll be lots of memories there. I'm gonna check the real estate listings. Maybe there's something with a pool. It's the best thing that's ever happened to me. Oh, I shouldn't say that out loud. Don't judge me. Ooh, you really have been drinking. You know what? I'm gonna catch up with you. If ever there's a night to get shit faced, oh, this is it. Do you believe in the resurrection of the body? You think Marigold's coming back from the dead? No. I mean, when the dead rise up. You have gotta stop watching those zombie movies. I mean, judgment day. Better not be a judgment day. I mean, adultery is a sin, right? Or did that replacement Pope change that? He's so sweet. Well, God forgives us. Yeah? Does he? Like for everything? I once gave Ralph a blowjob in his car next to the baseball field where his kid was playing Little League. Oh. It's gonna take a lot of alcohol to catch up to where you are. Oh. Oh. Oh, I think I'm gonna leave. I think I'm gonna leave. Oh, where are you going? I thought he was gonna... meet me halfway. Take my hand. And we walk towards the bright light together. Uh... looks like I'm on-- I'm on my own. Oh, I think I am going to... What? ...this. Take it easy, Kate. Don't expect too much of yourself. We're so lucky that I was there to save her life. It's such a shame that she broke her nose when she fell. I got blood on my angel costume. We're gonna have to have a talk about that, Kate. But for now, let's just get you settled at home. Okay? Your good friend here's gonna help take care of you. Yeah, I'll do anything to take care of her. Hey, you see, Kate? When you start your gratitude journal, you be sure you put friendship at the top. Right next to vodka. Did you say right next to God? Sure. Yeah. Why don't you go and get changed? And I'm gonna go over a few things here with Jenna. -Okay. -Not that you don't have agency over your own life. You do. I'm just gonna go have a look around the environment. There's food in the fridge, dishes are done. Looks like she's been taking care of herself. Well, she did say it was an accident. Oh, you know, even if it wasn't, I'm sure it was just one bad night. We can all have blues. Do you have her pills? -Yup. -Okay. Make sure she gets one in the morning and one at night. They help smooth things out a little bit. You know, take out the highs and lows. -They do? -Mm-hmm. Okay. Best thing is that for the next three, four days she gets rest. You keep her away from anything that might increase stress. -Okay. -Okay. You give me a call if our girl needs anything. Will do. Bye. You are still here. We don't have much time. I beg to differ. -Put this on. -What? We have to hurry. I have to change too. I-- We'll stop by my place on the way. On the way where? Marigold's funeral. Or the reception. It's probably too late for the funeral, dammit! Oh, you look pale. No, I cannot go to a funeral. What? Wh--why? The last funeral I went to was my husband's. Oh, no, that's all the more reason for you to go. I man, it's just-- it's like riding a bike. You gotta climb back on your horse. -No, no, no. -Come on. He died months ago. You can't never go to another funeral. Oh, I need you. Please. Oh, Jenna. Jenna. Jenna. Hi. Are you, Cam? It's so nice to finally meet you. I'm Jenna. I work in one of your dad's dental clinics. I brought donuts. With sprinkles. Yummy. How do I look? I-- I think you look the way you're trying to look. Good. I hope he's not too surprised to see me. What? You were invited here, weren't you? No. But I have every right to be here. -I'm his girlfriend. -God! No! We have to go. -What? Why? -Let's go. Why? Okay. Right in here. Okay. Oh, I'll just wait out here let you two have your alone time. What are you doing here? I hadn't heard from you, so I was worried. My children are here. They're gonna have to meet me at some point. Was that Cam at the door? He's so much taller than I expected. My in-laws are here. What? Y-y-you don't have to introduce me as your girlfriend. I just thought you might want me. I-- I think this might be a mistake, Jenna. If you were secretly sleeping with someone else, wouldn't you wanna be at your husband's funeral to be there in your time of need? -I'll take her home. -No, no, no, no, no, no. People will see you. Well, uh, why can't we just say that-- I don't know. That, you know, she's one of your employees who wanted to offer condolences. Look what she's wearing. You told me you like this dress. There's not enough alcohol in the world to get me through this. Do you have alcohol? I sure could use a drink. You're acting like you're ashamed of me. Uh, not to get overly involved here, but I think you two could use some assistance. I think what Jenna wants you to know, Ralph, is that she's been a little concerned about you and wanted to give you her condolences and donuts. And-- and I think what Ralph is trying to express, Jenna, -is that-- -I really don't think that I need advice from somebody that looks like they just got in a bar fight. Oh, no. No, I'm not-- not a bar fight kinda gal. No, no, no, no. I just tried to kill myself. A new rule in life, fall backwards. I saved her life. And now you're acting like I'm not good enough to meet your kids? You look like a whore. Oh! Oh, my God. This-- this-- this is God punishing me. I highly doubt that God has anything to do with what's happening here today or anywhere. Meaning, if there is an interventionist God, then he has one pretty cruel, wacky sense of humor. This is-- this-- this is God. This is God punishing me for cheating on the most wo-- wonderful mother and wife. I'm the one that should have died, not my poor Marigold. Every night that she would sleep alone while I was out sneaking around with-- I gave you six years. Six years. What did I get in return? Oh, really? Let's start with that-- that-- that bracelet, the necklace. Marigold was lonely once a week. I had to spend every goddamn Christmas by myself. Every New Year's Eve. I don't know how many countless nights you didn't even call. You knew I was married. You knew I had kids. You said you loved me. You asked me to wait until you were free. Now you're free and you're calling me a whore? You know, there were times when you'd make me feel like one. Like when you would show up at work, at work, and bring me into the supply closet because you wanted to have your dick sucked. And everybody knew what was happening. Those was dentists with their goddamn drilling jokes. Oh, please, you wanted it just as much as I did. Because I thought you loved me. Because I thought that you were gonna marry me. It's not like you're good in bed. Hey, hey, hey. We don't wanna say anything we're gonna regret later. It might be too late to raise that point. I put my dick in your mouth so I wouldn't have to listen to your nonstop yammering. You're not fit to step a foot in my wife's home, you bitch. Um, I think-- I think we'll just-- No, no, no, you're gonna stay right here until the coast is clear. Hey, you still work for me, right? You know how hard it would be for you to get another job at your age? Stay right here. Yeah, uh, sorry, this toilet isn't working. You're gonna have to try one of the other ones. And I'm just going to put a note on the door so no one knows to go in here. I think I have to pee. Maybe I just feel like it because I'm sitting here. You go ahead. Kids are in bed. No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You need to go home. No, the mental health woman said to make sure that you are okay. I'm okay. How do I know that you're not gonna kill yourself? I won't. I give you my word. I wanna be alone. I don't wanna be alone. But don't talk to me. I can't believe we both lost the men we love. What can I say? Good morning. What do I have to live for now? Well... Nope. I got nothing. Can I-- can I keep some of those no highs, no lows pills? Sure. You can have 'em all. Thank you. I already took a few. Kinda suspected that. You really think I'll be okay without Ralph? Of course you'll be okay without Ralph. You're gonna be-- you're gonna be fine without your husband. You will. Oh. Your nose. What happened? You seemed so upset the other night. We started to worry. So we came by yesterday to make sure you were okay. The neighbor said you went to the hospital. We should've never left you alone. Aw. Oh, I want a hug too. Oh, if it weren't for me, she'd be dead. Is that true? Well, yeah. I-- I guess it is. Yeah. It's the first life I ever saved. No, there was that kangaroo. Long story. So when I was 15, I had this part-time job at a zoo. I did see that suicide was not a solution. If Jenna hadn't shown up, my kids would've been at my funeral saying-- actually saying really nice things about me instead of-- Have you lost your ever loving mind? No. She has-- she has lost her mind. It was an accident. I took an extra pill or two to help me sleep. Why should we believe you? Yeah, Jenna told us everything. You-- you-- you quit your job. It was a leave of absence. Oh. And you're still hanging out with those weird kids? Like, who knows what's gonna happen next? Nobody. So Jason and I have decided-- Wait, wait. We haven't decided, decided. Jason, I live with Chandni, you are on your own. So it make sense-- Doesn't mean I don't have a life. I mean-- We need to do something. So Jason will be moving in with you. Just-- just until you're back to being your old self. Because this, it's not like you. They seemed so sure of who the real Kate was. Was that because of my age? Is there-- is there a point when it's assumed we will no longer change? Is that it? What? Oh my God. Spending weeks on end with a babysitter was a bit of an adjustment. What the-- Why would you do that? Why would you do that? Oh, hey, I, uh, I put some laundry in the laundry room. When's dinner? I'm starving. Uh... I'll just put the laundry in and get dinner going. That's great. Thanks. Come on. Come on. You guys are nuts, man. I can't believe you got grounded. That's the worst. And he expects me to do the laundry and make the meals. Wanna smoke some weed? That cheers me up. Sure. All right. Got a light? -Ooh, I do. -Mm-hmm. Hey, lady, it's legal. This is Canada. I think maybe it's because we're not supposed to smoke indoors. Right. Let's go. Every day is the same. I agree with that 100%. I get up at 11, play video games, have breakfast. My mom yells at me when she gets home. I eat dinner, hang out with you guys. Next day, same thing all over again. I love it. Maybe I should play video games. Oh, yeah. When I was with my girlfriend, some days were different. Mm, a girlfriend? She broke his heart. Sorry. I am not romantic at all. I don't think I'll ever be in love with anyone. Mm, easier said than done, my little one. Ugh. You-- you love someone and then you have children, and then you buy a house so the children have rooms. And then you get a job you hate just to pay for the children and the house. And then you spend your life meeting the demands of the capitalist overlords. I say fuck romance. And fuck the neoliberal machine. Who streets? Our streets! Who streets? Our streets! Who streets? Our streets! Who streets? Our streets! Who streets? Our streets! Who streets? Our streets! And when you love someone, you have to be who they want you to be. Or they leave you like Dylan's girlfriend and your husband. It's-- Yeah. Now you're-- you're on your own. Not Mrs. Whatever. You must feel different. Yeah. It's-- Well, what if your husband gets sick of Spain? What if he walks in the door tomorrow? You think you'd still love him? Yeah. Yeah. But-- but do you think that he would love the person you are now or not? Hard to say. I don't wanna have to be a certain way to hold on to love. How many people in the world do you think don't have someone to love them? - Probably the majority. - That's like... ...billions of people. Yeah, that's true. And-- and when you think you have it, you might lose it any moment. Pfff! Gone. Yeah. You've said it, sister. But if nobody ever loves us reliably-- Reliably. I mean... There has to be something we can do, right? Something more than shoplifting or smoking dope that makes us feel... Mm. Okay. Okay. Sometimes I go running in the woods and I scream. And? -No, that's it. -Oh. Like I go into the woods... ...and I scream as loud as I can. I like that. Okay. Yeah. I've got one. When I was a little kid, I used to just dance anywhere. -Hmm. -Twirl around. When I got old, I stopped. Sometimes I miss it. Hmm. Well, I used to shit on the sidewalk. Think we'll go with Nisha's idea. Oh, my God. Thank God you're alive. I totally forgot I tried to kill myself just a few weeks earlier. But then again I had smoked quite a bit of weed. We almost called the police. What's so funny about that? I don't know. I'm gonna crash. You're just gonna go out for hours and then go to bed? Uh, yeah. Well, excuse me, you haven't even done the laundry yet, so. Okay. You should be doing your own goddamn laundry, Jason. I'm just making a point here about general failure to function. Mom, I don't even know what to say to you. Do you have anything you wanna say to us? Uh, don't worry, I didn't get knocked up. She's flying. She's high as hell, look at her. This plan didn't work. What now? Chandni had one idea, but it's a long shot. Okay, come on. -Finally. -Hey, I got her here. -That's what she's wearing? -She didn't wanna come. Uh, she. Hello? I'm here. Okay, for the record, I think this is a crappy idea. Well, we had to do something because she got married so young and she's never been alone before. - What? - It hasn't even been a year. -Why does she-- -Three words. Joyce Carol Oates. Okay, Mom, I'm gonna see you at home. Leah's gonna drive you back. Okay? -You're leaving? -Are you kidding me? I'm thrilled to have the night off. Good luck. Good luck? Why did he just say good luck? Well, uh, Chandni and I actually, we have a little surprise for you, Mom. I don't like surprises. Everyone likes surprises. No, I don't like surprises. Nobody likes surprises. What-- Okay, why did-- why did Jason leave? -Is this an intervention? -No. Is this an intervention? Because I'm 100% compos mentis. - No, no, no that's not-- - Kate. Kate. Remember I-- I-- I think I must have mentioned the owner of the bookstore I work at, Henry. Henry, this is Leah's mother, Kate. How could you? Chandni said he's really nice and his wife died last year. So you two have something in common. What? Dead spouses? -Look we just-- -Whoopee, whoopee. You married Dad when you were 22. You've always had a man around to keep you company -and change light bulbs. -Well, a-- a man. A man. A man. A specific man. Your father. And I'm capable of changing a fucking light bulb. Mom, you do not use the F word. Well, yeah? Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Okay. Well, he is in there so what do you want me to do? Send him home? He's not-- I don't want-- I don't want your help. I told you to ask her first. You know, I thought this would be our best shot. Let's just eat. Get this over with. Uh, Kate's been going through a bit of a difficult time. -I broke my nose. -Oh. Took an overdose. When I passed out, I landed face first. But she's doing so much better. She's really turned a corner. We can't lie to him. He's my boss. Chandni says you teach English literature at the university. I stopped going. I believe they replaced me. Any hobbies? I hang out with some kids at a restaurant near my house. We like to dress up in Halloween costumes. I collect stamps. I have never taken an overdose, fallen over and broken my nose yet. But who knows what tomorrow may bring. Was... meant as a joke to break the ice. Guess I failed. But no, that was-- that was so cute. Who knows what tomorrow will... I cannot imagine how difficult it must be to lose one's life partner. If I ever lost Chandni-- Some days that wouldn't seem as bad. I mean, I miss Dad so much, but... for my mom and for you and-- and your late wife. -Her name was? -Alice. Right. Alice. But life is for the living, is it not? And at some point we must turn to others who are alive and so we can have the things that we miss. Right? Like companionship. Leah, just give it up. This is a train wreck. Do you wanna have sex? I beg your pardon? I'm sorry. Are you hard of hearing? Do you want to have sex? Sure. Uh... No, no, no. Not here, at my-- my place. Right now? People keep telling me to live in the present, so. Thank you so much for dinner. Okay. I mainly did it to shock my daughter. But I did miss being touched. I can hang your coat. Thanks. Nice place. Oh, it's comfy. Not much of a decorator. You have just the two kids, uh, Leah and, uh, your son? Yes. -I just have the one. -I don't care. Okay. I had a shower this morning. So did I. I don't shower every day now. Me neither. Do you want me to shave my legs? I-- I'm not shaving anything else. I didn't shave mine. Do you mind using the guest room? I-- it might be a bit messy because my son's been staying there. No problem. You want a drink first? Don't need it. If you want one. No, no. I-- I stopped. It was, you know, causing a bit too much... Yeah, I know that phase. The room's upstairs. Lead the way. Any-- any second thoughts? B-- Because I-- I really didn't mean to-- I always have second thoughts. I try not to let them stop me. Maybe a kiss first? Oh, I, uh... I hadn't thought about that. I was focusing on-- Might be nice. Uh... Okay. Uh, I suppose I should get going. Do you mind if I get a glass of water first? Oh, there's-- there's tea if you'd like. No. Water's fine. I'll-- I'll get it. My first was a neighbor. She bombarded me with casseroles. Eventually wore me down. The next was a-- a supplier. I was drunk, very drunk. We ended up in a hotel room. You are the third. I wanted it to be horrible. I really wanted it to be horrible. I know. And then? Sex is sex. Tell me about him. Oh, yeah. He was, uh, yeah, a character. Loved, loved, loved, loved, loved, loved Halloween. He kept all his costumes. Kept the ones he got for me too, even though I hated them. Sometimes I'd come home and he'd be sitting watching TV in a bunny costume just-- just-- just for fun. He had lots of opinions. He was always telling the kids what to do, even though they never listened to him. Uh, he never got mad even when they do the exact opposite. He was always late. Always, always late. I mean, you know, he could get quite annoying. We didn't have the perfect marriage. Don't you hate those people who do? Oh, yeah. Yeah. "Never had a single fight since first time we met." God, they're not human. But whatever... ...whatever happened, I never doubted that I loved him and that-- that he loved me. And now I don't-- I don't-- I don't know how-- how to live-- live without him. Oh, I just-- Why don't you tell me about Alice? Oh. She was a keeper. Tiny thing with an enormous temper. I was a little afraid of her, to be honest. Yeah. She loved music. She loved going to concerts, especially pop stars, you know. She went to a Miley Cyrus concert once, came back saying she was the oldest person there by decades. But she didn't care. She loved it. I listen to Bach, so. She sounds like a wonderful person. She was. Still up, Mom? It's late. Um, I-- I guess I'll go to bed. Okay. Night, sweetheart. Yeah. Good night. Oh, You might wanna change your sheets. What the fuck! Come on! Shit! That was fun, seeing his reaction. But I-- I-- I had to put a stop to their meddling. So I asked to speak to both my children the next day to tell them to stay out of my personal life. -But-- -We're so excited about Henry! He told Chandni how much he likes you. I know it's super-fast, but-- -Yeah. Indeed. -Jason was so funny. He-- he was like, "They did it in my bed." It's true. And on the first date. Well, she propositioned him. Yeah. I couldn't help but think is this some creepy guy taking advantage of a lonely widow? They just clicked. I mean, it happens, right? Her and Dad always said they just clicked at that costume party they met at. Anyway, I-- I know that we don't know for sure how things will turn out yet, but I think you were right. Why wait? You know, especially at your age. Mom... who was that crazy lady with the vodka and costumes and those strange kids? 'Cause I still don't really know who they were. And the whole overdose. That was like terrifying. But now you know someone who-- Henry. And he's like, so suitable in your life, Mom. I feel like... we're getting you back, you know? 'Cause we lost Dad and we can't lose you too. She was so happy, so relieved. But all's well that ends well. Can I just have another hug? We're really sorry if it seemed like we were telling you what to do. Might've gone too far there. Jason is gonna go back to his place and, um, we'll give you two kids some privacy. But if there's any, um, dips or dives, Mom, just call us. You know, we know we weren't supportive enough, but... this time, we'll rush over right away no matter what we're doing because all we want is for you to be happy again. Like you were with Dad. And we're sure, sure that-- that, um, that Dad would be happy too, because he would just want the same thing that we want. And that's for you to be yourself again. Oh. Okay, kiddo. When was I happiest in my life? Did I know it at the time? I don't care if it's goddamn Halloween. I look like an idiot in this thing. Eric, this is so stupid! They all laugh at us! I am not going to put it on! One of these days I'm gonna throw out these goddamn costumes. If I didn't know what the best times were when they were happening, how could I be so sure now? For you. -Oh. -Mm-hmm. Maybe... this was happiness too or something that could lead to happiness. So I went back to teaching, Henry and I kept seeing each other. And after a suitable length of time... It is time for you to leave for the church. Wow. My goodness. You look so gorgeous. Thank you. Oh, I can't believe you're getting married before me. Yeah. Can you believe it? I almost invited Ralph as my plus one. -Jen, oh, really? -We've been talking. I mean, he shows up at work so I see him. And he apologized for that night. I mean, Cam's left home and he's all alone in that huge house. He has a house. He has money. He treated you very badly. Look at you in your cute little veil. Oh, nobody wants to be alone. Is that so bad? We can't waste our lives waiting for happiness to show up. Mom, we're gonna be late. Let's go. Woo! This is so exciting! Okay. This is so cool. Never thought we'd be walking you down the aisle on your wedding day. Okay. It's showtime. You ready? No. No. I can't do this. Mom, no, no. It's okay. It's-- everyone gets nervous on their wedding day, right? Even when I married Chandni, remember, I-I was like, -"What am I doing?" -I-- Is this about dad? Because he wouldn't want you to be alone. Do you see your father here? Who knows what he'd want? It's what I want. Henry loves you. Henry doesn't know me. He's afraid of being alone. And so am I. I-- I know the truth is not what children wanna hear from their mother. I was happy with your father, yes. I was happy. I was reasonable. I was well-behaved. I didn't upset anyone. I didn't need to. I had the life I wanted. And I-- I tried. I tried, I tried very hard to get back to that but... maybe I let in too much madness. I kinda love the madness, you know. I love howling and screaming, dancing like a fool. I look in the mirror and I thought, who is that person? Who's she gonna be? I don't know. I don't know. I need to take chances and figure out who I wanna be. Whatever it is. Wherever it takes me. Oh, sweethearts. I know. I know. Losing your dad was hard for you. And I love you so very much. But you have your lives. I need to have mine. Okay. No, no. That is not the meaning of life. The meaning of life is-- is-- -Hey! -Hello, friend. I like the other bride costume more. -Oh yeah? -No, this is nice. Elegant. Love the little veil. Oh, yeah. Oh, those costumes you let us keep, we still put them on sometimes. Though I, uh, I-- I ripped the dog's ass. Oh, yeah. Hey, we should get that fixed. -Oh, yeah. -No, don't worry. How are you? I'm okay. How are you guys? Oh, I got a job. A real one. I designed posters and stuff. Well, not posters yet, flyers, but, uh, I have plans. And I get to work at home, my own hours. -Sounds great. -Mm-hmm. And I'm gonna stay with my sister in Toronto. -Oh! -Look for something there. School or a job, I don't know. Yeah, it'll be exciting. It'll be exciting. -Maybe start a revolution. -Okay. Sounds good. And I got a promotion, so no deliveries anymore. Woohoo! Woo! That's great. I'm so happy for you all. Really, that's great. Actually, uh, I should get going. My shift starts soon. Yeah. I got a deadline on a bowling alley flyer. I should go too. My mom's renting out my room, so I gotta put all my stuff in boxes. Hey, go on. It's fine. Go on. Get outta here. It's fine. It's good. You got stuff to do. Hey, um, thanks for dropping by, checking up on us. -Yeah. Yeah. -No problem. -See ya. -Okay. Maybe not, I might never come back here. Oh. Uh, how about something to remember us by? No, wait. Ooh. Okay. See ya. Bye, guys. Do you wanna have sex? Oh. Hmm. Who streets? Our streets! Angel. Hello? Is anyone there? Kate?
