Sometimes when the soul is too broken or confused, it becomes a target of the fundamental darkness, the innate devil force of the universe. The soul is given a diluted power and identity until the advent of its downfall. This downfall is brought by Taven, the warden of this dark world. There is no right or wrong in the eyes of Taven, only consequences. This is the battle of the evil versus the darkness. Holly, Holly? Come here baby. Come here. Come here, come here. Yeah. We found him again. So he finally arrived? Yes. It took a lot of work, but sources have confirmed. He's active in our area. What can I do? You are the chosen one. I am? Yes. Are you sure they made the right decision? Never doubt the decision of the COJ. I know you're ready. Don't worry. We'll be staying close by. Here, I now bestow you the symbol of honor. You're now officially Taven. So, you are the chosen one. Yes. Do you know what you're up against? Please, guide me. The fundamental darkness is what you're fighting against. What does that mean? Call upon the ultimate evil to counter it. The ultimate evil? Me. It is what's called turn poison into medicine. What's left in you? Only Taven. Why wouldn't you stop this evil cycle? Everything needs a balance. Without the evil, what's the good? It's an easy excuse for avoiding challenging yourself. No, it's not an excuse, when you can realize how much power you have. No, it's not your power. It's an illusion, lent to you. Really? Try this, then. Let me show you the essence of Taven. You stopped fighting. Why? To protect someone, and passion. I will keep coming back. Rose, are you okay? Something is not right. I feel a much more powerful force than the source has indicated. I'm worried about Romona. A more powerful force? How is that possible? There is something foreign in him. A borrowed energy to boost himself. A borrowed energy. You can borrow and transfer factions into actual energy in the form of force. Chloe? Hey, Ian. Just come back from work? I thought you were practicing with your friend? I was about to leave. So how was teaching? It was fine, just a couple of new students. Hey, you're drinking my juice again. Here, have some juice, and get some rest. Yeah, I should. What? Why? That guy is poor. We're going to die anyway. Let's get out of here and get some drinks. Okay. Hey. Why wasting efforts protecting those? Speak! They're like my family. They accept me for who I am. But they may not even appreciate you. It's okay. I don't mind. Follow me, and I'll spare you. No. You are the devil. What do you expect from me then? If I put up a good fight, spare my friends. It won't be easy. It's not time yet. Are you quitting? Any more? Hate me or fear me, you'll feel better. Something different about the way you played tonight. So when will you agree to record an album together? I don't know. It feels like you're under surveillance when you're playing for a recording machine. Knowing you all these years, this is the weirdest thing about you. Do you have anything that I can wipe this? Dammit, where's my... What about this? Who are you? I just wanted to observe you before I speak to you. Hi, my name is Rose. I'm Ian. Ian, what I'm about to tell you might sound a little crazy, but it's definitely the truth. Wait a minute. Okay. You're the chosen one, Ian. Am I on TV? I'm on TV, right? Am I? No, you're not. You have been chosen as the new Taven to counter the manifestation of the fundamental darkness. I'm sorry. Rose, right? I don't know what you're talking about. I understand your response, but this is dead serious. I want you to help us fight against Viro. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I think you're talking to the wrong guy. All right, I'm a musician, okay? You will be, if you allow me to bestow to you the essence of Taven. No thanks. If you'll excuse me, I have to go now, okay? Best luck to you, Rose. You will be tested, Ian. Are you Ian? I need to talk to you. You try to disrespect me? Please, just let me go. Wait, wait. Let's talk, all right? What do you wanna talk about? I think you guys are looking for the wrong person. I'm not into mob or anything like that. Because of you, our friend is dead. And there's payback time. What? No, please. I didn't cause anyone's death. You got the wrong guy. Oh, I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Oh, Ian. can fly. Hey, what are you doing here? Do you wanna, wanna join me? Actually, will you allow me to walk you home? What do you want from me? I didn't do anything. Who killed their buddies? What? Oh no. He's gonna come after me next. Who you talking about? Please, let me go. He's gonna come for me. Who is he? I don't know, a freak. He appears and disappears out of nowhere. I want you to go after someone. What, kill him? And if you don't complete this, I'm gonna come after you. Can you describe the look of this person you are trying to run away from? I don't know. Long hair, no eyebrows. Heavy eyeliner. Slim, but fast and powerful. Who are you? Private detective. I've been searching for this man for years. Good luck with that. He is like a ghost. Well, you're probably right. What the hell are you talking about? According to my study, he's no human. Some sort of mythological entity. What? You better pray for your sins. Wait? What do you mean? Where you going, man? Come on, help me out. I can't guarantee, but you need to seek asylum from a member of the COJ. COJ? The Coalition of Justice. They're the ones that fight against this guy. What? How am I supposed to find them? That, I don't know. Good luck, buddy. What, wait, can I come with you? Sorry, man, I work alone. Oh, come on, man. Don't leave me out here like this? Have I made myself clear? Yes, yes, yes. Just calm down, okay? Shit! What you think you're doing? Fuck you, you freak. What did you do to my friends? They deserve what they got. I'm gonna kill you. Come on, come on. Foolish human. Shut up. Time to die. Wait, wait. Please don't kill me. Just give me one more chance. Drink up. It'll help you calm down. I suppose you encountered something unusual. What's going on? Who are these people that are telling me strange things, and attacking me? You are the chosen one. What? Why are you saying the same thing as that woman? You have been chosen to be the Taven, the one who will counter the fundamental darkness. The fundamental darkness, the negative force that lies deep within our lives. It has existed since the beginning of the Saha world. Viro is the manifestation of this negative force, so that it can cause the conspicuous corrosion of society. Everyone can realize or be connected to this fundamental darkness in the way that you have. Most people battle it internally, through their consciousness. You're chosen because there is a deep karma in you. A poison you must cultivate in order to turn into medicine. And Taven is the expedient means by which you can accomplish this. The poison inside of me? Battling against Viro is ultimately battling against your own weakness, your own self-doubt. You have to win over your own fear before you can win over your enemy. Why are you so familiar with this? I was once a Taven. So, that mysterious woman, she's a Taven, too? No, she's a messenger. In the network of the Coalition of Justice, or COJ. We have messengers who are candidates to be Taven, when the time is right for them. But I was never a messenger. This is a part I can't explain. I have a feeling there is something unprecedented here. What should I do? Accept Rosie in. She needs your help. I think you are the keeper sent to help them overcome this crisis. I've been waiting for a successor. This is now yours. How do you manage to wait for me here every day to walk me home? I have my way. I can travel really fast. That sounds so weird. Sometimes you really sound like a freak, you know? Really? Yeah. Also it's funny how sometimes I feel like you're just standing next to me. You're funny. I'm joking. The truth is I care. I just wanna be able to see you every day. What? What do you have over there? You've been carrying it all night. This thing? This is actually for you. I wanted to return you a new one. May I? Thank you. I like you. Come on, run me home. Chloe! Are you okay? Is everything okay? You leave her alone. It's not up to you to decide. She's innocent. Don't do this to her. Wait a minute. Am I missing something? Let's end this now. Fight me. Wait, wait! No. No, just go. Come on, come to me. Hi! Hi. What secret do you have for me? Oh, yes, I have a big secret for you. Are you excited? I guess so. Do you want to know the secret of becoming powerful? Yes, very much. Good, but it's not fair if only I am telling a secret. Do you want me to tell you a secret, too? Actually, no. I just want you to promise me something. I feel so lonely. Will you be my friend forever? Yes. I will be your friend forever. Yay! Okay, come closer to me. I want to feel you. Taven calling out! Fuck, this is stupid. Oh! What are you doing? Well, you know, trying to give you some signals. I know. It was fun watching you for a while. Very funny. So, why do you want to see me? I wanna help you. I wanna understand more about Viro, Taven, and... Her name is Romona. She was the Taven one year ago, who fought against Viro. What happened to her? She gave herself too deep into the real power of the original Taven. And now it is holding her soul, as hostage. You mean Taven did this to her? Yes. Original Taven is not a saint. It is a vehicle, turning poison into medicine. Thus, it is still venomous itself. So this is what I'm in for, to help awaken another Taven? The thing is, I only know that you will have the ability to communicate with the original Taven. But I don't know how to instruct you to do that. I suppose I'll find out. Please, Ian. I'm counting on you to save her. Where can I find her? She's in a deeper sleep. I kept her in a compartment at this location where all destructions can be avoided. I can't really get near by her anymore because of the dark force that has been building up around her by the original Taven. Only a soul that carried the same energy force as Taven can approach her now, and the possessor of that soul is you. Hey, buddy. Yeah, let's do it. Let's record something nice. And we'll talk about it when you come over. Okay, see you. You've gone weak. Aren't you tired of being in this evil cycle? Why not quit? It will never end, as long as civilization is here. I am the shadow of your existence. Why are you here, really? You. I want you to be the catalyst to draw them all to the final fight. Are you declaring war this time? Yes. I'm gonna kill both of them, and seal the deal with the COJ. You will be cursed for eternity, by both the COJ and your own creator. It doesn't matter anymore. I'm already cursed for something forbidden. Why don't you just surrender to your doom? You're forgetting about a character in us humans, dignity. I suppose. What do I know about dignity? I'm just your darkest fear. My return gift for you. Too bad. I won't get to see the end of your story. Goodbye, Wing. Rose, in time we shall meet again under the world of tranquility, Alice. Where are you, Alice? Long time no see. Alice, what happened to you? I'm fine. In fact, I feel great. Come back, Alice! Don't fall for this! Stop this evil cycle! What are you talking about? I'm not involved in some sort of evil cycle. Yes, you are. You're derailed. Step out from this illusion. It's not too late! It's not an illusion, Rose. This is real power, power so real that you can't even imagine. What power? This power. Alice. Why don't you join me? Come on, we can create our own empire. No. Then this is where we will part. If you choose to walk away, you will be my enemy. So be it. Isn't life full of unexpectations? Watch me reap my triumph. She's turning into Davada. Shut up. You don't know anything. Help me understand! Please. Give me a chance to earn your trust. I wanna help you. Let me join this fight. Are you sure you're ready for this? I have been, for years. Even at the risk of your life? - Yes. Ceremony Vanity. That is where and when everything will be decided. I will be there. Be careful. Something will try to stop you. Too hard. So swollen. Why can't life be more peaceful? Why do you say that? Why do people judge each other so badly before understanding first? I don't know. Perhaps due to instincts. Or maybe bad memories. I don't think he understands you the way I do. You mean Ian? He's never like that to anyone. He seems to hate you so much. I'm sorry. It's all because of me. No. It's not your fault. I hope you accept me one day. I'll need to talk to him. I don't want you two to be like this. Stay still. I'm going to try to make you feel better. Close your eyes. Oh, my God! Come here. Who are you, really? What do you mean? I knew from the beginning that you are not who you say you are. Who do you think I am then? A ghost, I don't know. You're too precise. There's no complexity in you. Chloe? Yeah? I have something to give to you. Oh. Where did you get this? It's a special thing. Only made from your hometown. When it glows even brighter, it means I'm thinking about you a lot. And when it happens, would you hold it and think about me, too? I will feel it. You are playing with fire. And you can't control it anymore. You cannot confuse me. Taven will defeat you. Never! It is a futile cycle. Ceremony Vanity. Are you ready, Taven? Yes. The battleground is over there. Be careful. Detective Leone. You must get going now. Why? No time to explain. Do as I say. Call me when you leave. Stay here, you're safe. I'll be right back. Okay? Hello? Hey, so I'm outside. What's all the commotion? Hello? Hello? Holly! Rose, that son of a bitch killed my friend! I told her to stay home, Rose. How could I? I thought it would be safe for her. Stay strong. It is the way he is trying to defeat you. You must keep going. I'll see you in a minute. Stay alert. The ceremony has begun. Who are you? I'm Leone, and I'll be hosting the show on behalf of Rose tonight. It's Rose. She tricked me. What's the matter, Davada? Feeling stupid? You'll pay for this, you stupid human. What now, Alice? Why don't you come out and surrender? Alice? Alice? Alice? Alice? Shit. Now you know who you're up against. What? Are you scared? I won't kill you now. I like to keep some of my adversaries around. You are crazy! Maybe, but I love the feeling. Sorry, Rose. I hope I bought you enough time. Finally, you're here. Stay strong, Taven. Dammit, Taven. Why don't you just die? I can't, not before I defeat you. Let me go. I found a way to stay in the Saha world. I don't wanna leave again. No, you must pay retribution for your negative causes first. Remember the essence of Taven? Here it is again. I hate the essence of Taven. What's going on? Chloe, Chloe, can you hear me? Hear me please, Chloe. Will you hear me? I need you. I need you, Chloe. Get up, Taven! Fight me. I feel weak, so weak. Have I fallen? Have I failed true faith? I'm trying so hard, but maybe I'm just not strong enough. Wake up, Ian. It's not over. What's this? Stop this now! Don't kill anymore. Pay for your sin, Viro. Rest assure, I'm not Viro anymore. Before I'm forever condemned I just wanna say that I was once alive in this world, living with someone that I loved very much. My name was Tiga. And Luna was the love of my life. I once existed in this world of Saha. We laughed, and we lived our lives to the fullest. And all I wanted to do was to keep her close to me, to protect her from harm. And to offer everything I had to make her happy. But she became ill, and died, of a mysterious cause. And I was devastated. I asked myself why, why should a good person like her deserve such tragedy? It's not fair. I lost hope, and I began to hate this world. I had gone mad and murdered the doctor who tried to cure her, and I carved his heart out. But I wasn't happier. A dead heart could not bring back the love of my life. At that moment it approached, the fundamental darkness. I sold my soul to it, and vowed to bring calamities to wherever it designated me to, with the ultimate evil. But she came back as Chloe to find me. Trying to awaken me, to nirvana and love. I will follow her trail, and find her. And I'll ask for her forgiveness. Thank you, Taven. That was the last I've learned about what happened from Rose. A broken soul got a second chance to pursue his love. It was one of the strangest cases I've encountered. And the mystery continues to affect me, as if it hasn't ended yet.
