You're sure they're coming? - Yes, I'm sure of it. Imagine, 4 kilos of heroine. That's a month's junk for all London. The Queen ought to decorate you, Myrna, for the service you rendered us. When they find out I betrayed them the Queen may have to decorate my grave. Good luck, Myrna. It look certain, governor. Myrna is coming. Do it just as he tells you. I'll be asleep. I thought we were supposed to be unarmed. Go ahead. Get on with it. What's all that about? Our junk is top grade. £100,000 Don't move. If you do, I'll shoot. So that's your game, is it? Good job. The boss heard every word! Inside of 24 hours you will be dead! - Hurry up, Jim. You've still a chance. Hello, this is Edgar Wallace speaking! Would you please get me Scotland Yard? And hurry! Give me Inspector Craig. - Craig speaking. This is Myrna. Myrna Fergusson. I'm terribly afraid, Inspector. Where are you? - Near the harbour, at the Hotel Portland. I've locked myself in, because I... I was followed here. I'll be there in 10 minutes. - Inspector, he's already here! Well, some gentlemen... It's beastly not to finish something you begin. It's my profession ahead of yours. You don't know me. You never saw me! ls that clear? How nasty. Will you step aside, please. Let's hop it before the police arrive. - Hey, not before we've settled accounts. Stand back! We're in for trouble. You never saw a thing. You won't get another penny from her. - We mustn't touch a thing... till the police come. You better go back to what you were doing! That goes for you, too! A scoop like this is sensational. It'll make all the morning papers. I'd slip you something for letting me in. - Be quick about it then. Go to your rooms and cover up. Or the police will think this is a brothel. That's enough. I got to call the police. We can't afford any scandal. How many have died? - Just one. Dreadful shooting, I'd say. - You're calm about this. How about a girl's profession? - Later, love. She came in late, Inspector, and asked me to ring Scotland Yard. Then I heard gun shots, ran up and found her lying in all that blood. The police are already here. So long, love. Let's keep in touch. You owe me. - I'll give you my card. I'll phone you. That's impossible. - She was dead. You're positive? But everybody saw her. You ask any of the guests. Nobody saw the murderer. You saw him? Well, then... Let's question those guests of yours. London. Ever since I was a child I dreamt about London. Australia has always been my home, and I adore it, but London is special. It's the hub of the world. Here I am. - Well, I'm envious. Everything's new to you. You're lucky. - You are wealthy and you travel the world. I have no more to discover. Life's dull. - You might try working. Me work? Only if I ran out of money would I do that. But it's not likely. However, if you'd like to help me, two can spend it better than one. Sorry. My schedule is already full. Will Miss Danny Ferguson please come to the information counter? You see, I'm being paged already. I hope we meet again soon. Will Miss Danny Fergusson please come to the information counter. Lufthansa announces the arrival of flight 73 from Berlin. I'm Miss Fergusson. - I'm to drive you to the Palace hotel. The results from the laboratory show that Miss Fergusson has blood type 0, rhesus positive. If the transfusion were not given within five or six minutes, a haemorrhage would have surely caused her death. Theoretically she could still be alive? - Yes, but it's only theoretically. I spend an entire evening preparing a beautiful statement for the press... to find you refuse it's release. The people have a right to be informed. The largest shipment of heroine I've ever encountered and no explanation... I have every good reason, Sir John, for insisting on keeping our methods. We stopped three deliveries of heroine. They now believe their competitors... did the stealing, otherwise they'd form a common front against the police. Our tactic is to divide and conquer. - I'm opposed to your methods. Now, in my day we confronted them fair, square and looked them right in the eye... and then... strike! - We've netted quite a haul. It's a pity the public can't be informed of oursuccesses on their behalf. 4 kilos of uncut heroine. Can you inspect the seal? I should like to incinerate it while you're present. What is it, Sir? - It's a monstrous waste! £100,000 turned into ashes. My dear Inspector, why not call the reporters... and release the story? They could write a glowing account, perhaps with a picture of me beneath it... Of us all, I mean. You'll pardon me, Sir John. But inspite of the impressive figure... you cut we have to think of our security. Your photographic print is liable... to do the Yard more harm than good. What sort of harm? What's he talking about? Your first visit in London? If there is anything we can do... to help make your visit a pleasant one, our entire staff is at your service. Did my sister leave a message here? - Anything for Miss Fergusson? Only a telephone request from your sister, that you'll be met at the airport. You didn't say you'd be here. Would you be so good as to send 50 red roses up to Miss Fergusson? I'm the owner of this hotel. It's kind of you to welcome me in person, Mr Stout. Perhaps you have news of my sister then. After all I was expecting Myrna... to be at the airport. And there was no message when I arrived at the hotel. Was she a dancer with the Royal Ballet? - Yes, you have news of her then? Correct, the name Ferguson is a rather common here. But when I saw a Ferguson had checked in I wondered if there was some connection. Mr Stout, is something wrong? I don't quite know how to tell you. I happened to read it in the morning's paper. Sometime last evening in a small hotel near the docks a Myrna Ferguson was shot. Her body had disappeared when the police arrived at the scene of the crime. "Member of the Royal Opera Ballet murdered." I'm sorry. I had hope that... I'm terribly sorry. I assure you, you have my deepest sympathy. If I were you, I'd go straight to Scotland Yard. Scotland Yard is the watchdog of the entire nation. Ever alert while the country is asleep, I mean so that she can't sleep soundly. But if Scotland Yard should be caught napping once, no Englishman would sleep soundly for a hundred years. But if they'd had our modern methods of criminal investigation... Rubbish! If I'd been there, I would have caught him! You would have caught whom? That is a pity. - A pity. Indeed, Inspector Craig. It's a perfect example of what happens to the morals of our country... when Scotland Yard is caught napping. I could have told those dunderheads... one or two things they overlooked, namely: Jack the Ripper was left-handed. You didn't know that, did you? Or that Jack the Ripper had a profound knowledge of the medical profession when all of the Royal family in those days were imbeciles. Medically speaking, that is. But I'll never rest until I know... who Jack the Ripper really was. And once I found out, I shall restore the honour of Scotland Yard. Sir John, a photographer to see you. - So soon? Did you bring... My image symbolises Scotland Yard. So therefore one is obliged... to take the trouble to be presentable. Rather splendid, if I say so myself. Send him in then. Well, young man, we're terribly busy here. My left side is what one usually takes. Not too intellectual, it gives a false impression. This is David Armstrong. He is not here to photograph you. He took the photograph of Myrna Ferguson's corpse. - Place him under arrest. He has been concealing material evidence. - Why that? I bring you the photos. A bit late. The corpse has disappeared. - The photos are all I've got. I take them. And you keep out of trouble. - I didn't come to Scotland Yard... for nothing. - You suggest I give you compensation? Please send a cheque, will you? - You insolent pack, get out of here! How can you stand a windbag like him? Hey, bird. Are you part of this outfit? How about a drink at the "Dryman Anchor"? Now, wait. Assuming no one was killed, as you seem to think, then surely there's no murderer. - There you go, being psychological again. It's a serious fault of your's. I don't know what you would do without me. Who's this girl, this ambulant corpse? The name rings a bell. What for? She's the one involved in... you know? Sir John, Miss Fergusson's been waiting all morning to see you. That walking corpse of yours. Tell her to amble in. From the start I knew there was something wrong. Miss Ferguson, I believe? This is Sir John, head of Scotland Yard. I'm Inspector Craig. Lovely. It's amazing. Your photographs don't do you justice. Is your name really Ferguson? Myrna Fergusson was my sister. This morning I arrived here from Sydney. Myrna was to meet me at the airport. At the hotel I heard why she didn't come. My dear child, we'll do all we can. I'm personally working on the case. Perhaps... I should let Inspector Craig explain though. He's been on it from the beginning. Take the young lady to your office. It happens to distract me when someone's straight on top of my desk. I hope you don't make it too long. I have a date with her at the pub. I have more important things in mind just now. How about you coming for a drink with me? - You forgot the date with Miss Ferguson. It's a threesome then. Could be fun. - Not when you don't like beer. It doesn't explain the crime. Why was my sister murdered? Why was she in that horrid hotel? - She lived there. But I thought she had an apartment in Regent Street. That's the address of a forwarding service. Her papers gave her address as the hotel, Hotel Portland, where she was murdered. - You didn't find anything? Only her purse and her jacket? Did you come to London for the purpose of seeing Myrna? She worked here for the last years. A few weeks ago she asked me to come. She said she'd saved enough for a vacation and sent me a round-trip ticket. I see. What will you do now? I won't leave till I find out what happened. I can't go home... untill I discover why she was killed. That could entail some risk. What do you mean? I have reason to believe that your sister was involved in smuggling heroine. What would you say to a drink? - Get out of my way. We could have a drink in my studio. I took photos of your sister. I saw those photos. - I got some you haven't seen, that no one has seen. You want me to show them to you? Why didn't you tell Scotland Yard about the photos? There was plenty to the papers. Look closely at this shot. Now in detail. That was just before the door was closed. Her arms dangling off the edge of the bed. An earring is lying there. And one shoe has fallen to the floor. Look at that. The door had been closed for a few seconds. Then I persuaded Benson to let me go in alone for a few more shots. Look, what happened in the meantime. Her arm is now on top of the bed. The earring is in her hand. And she has both shoes on. But who could have moved her? - While the door was closed... she had got up to put her shoe on. And then, when I opened the door she tried to take the same position. Do you realise what that means? Your sister was still alive. We must show the photos to the Inspector. - You can have them. For £100. I don't have £100 - The "Evening Herald" would pay this. But we must do all we can to help her! She may need medical care. If you ask me, it's all put on with blank bullets and fake blood. Your sister is probably as alive as I am. - I'll raise the £100 somehow. It has to be within five hours though. The Herald will press at midnight. I wouldn't mind that drink now. Five hours is quite a long time. A lot could happen. Yes, but I won't find £100 that easily. I'll return by midnight. I hope the best, as they say. It looks so bare. A diamond is worth me. Little Pinky looks so bare! See here, that's enough. Do you realise I've lost £100,000 over night? It's a tidy sum. Poor old stag. I have to go begging. Danny Fergusson here. I must speak to Inspector Craig! It's very urgent. I'm sorry. He can't be reached just now. I could take a message though. Tell him Myrna may still be alive. I have the photos which show... that she actually moved herself. - You've obtained the photos? Yes, from the photographer, Mr Armstrong. - Where are you? In my room at the Palace hotel. - Please wait in your room. I try to call back Inspector Craig. - You mustn't waste any time. If Myrna's alive she must be helped. I think I'll go quite mad. Mr Stout. Myrna Fergusson's alive. Jim. The boss wants to speak to you. What can I do for you? - You were on an assignment last night. I would like to know how everything turned out. I only heard your talk in the cemetary. Myrna pointed the gun at you. I knocked it out of her hand... - That simply won't wash. What do you mean by that? - Myrna Fergusson's alive. And You know it. But I told you, just... - I'll give you one hour to think. Then you might think clearer. Put him into the freezer... for an hour to refresh his memory. - But, governor, an hour? Well, shall we go on? - Can't we take a break? Absolutely not, Benson. Freddy? - I told you I didn't see the killer. No, that's not true, Benson. Stop playing the fool. You began by telling us that nobody passed your desk. Then you said a stranger had, but you've never seen him before. Simpson, why don't we release him? Tomorrow morning we'll tell the press he told us who the killer was. Would you tell me how long you think you'd live? If I tell, what then? - We'll see to it that you're protected. In a matter of hours we'll have the murderer, and you'll be free. I'll do it then. That man. Served time for three drug convictions, currently working for a meat packing firm. Donovan, the murderer of Myrna Fergusson. - Miss Danny Fergusson just told me... she's convinced her sister's alive. - Simpson, interrogate Donovan's employer. If they're here then I'll see them. - They're on their way already. Sergeant Simpson from Scotland Yard. - What can I do for you? We're looking for Jim Donovan. The name is not at all familiar. Have we got a Jim Donovan working here? Scotland Yard wants to know. Yes, Sir. - You want him sent in? Tell Donovan to come here. What do you think Donovan has done? - Could be murder. Murder. The boy here had got himself involved in a lot of nonsense, but murder? Of course, I make practice of hiring ex-prisoners to help them get on their feet. Sometimes they go back to petty crime, only... we had no murders so far. What is it, Sir? Do you know a Myrna Fergusson? - No, I don't. Last night she was shot to death. - I take that you suspect me. I worked the night shift. - Let's see if he did. Did Jim Donovan recently work at night? - Yes, the whole week. There must be some sort of mistake. - I'm hardly the judge of that. I have orders to take Donovan with us for questioning. Alright, Jim. Go with the gentlemen. I shall get you the best of legal advice. Convey my best wishes to Sir John. Tell him he owes me a game of golf. Jim Donovan will need a good lawyer. What happened? - I never thought you'd have a man... in your room at this time of night. - I must have fallen asleep. Otherwise I would have noticed if someone had come in. It seems that we both had a siesta. What about those photos? They've disappeared. Not a surprise. What sort of photos where they? - They were pictures of Myrna. Armstrong took them of her after she died. He took another set of her... shortly after the door had been closed by the clerk. Go on. - Those photographs show... that Myrna had changed the position in the meantime, that she got up. Look, Danny... How many people know about these photos? Outside of you no one but Armstrong. - Surely he wouldn't tell Scotland Yard. Nobody stands to make a killing from the newspapers. From now on I don't want you to ring me from the hotel. I have good reason to be suspicious. - ls anyone there? Pardon me. I shouldn't have thought you had a man in your room this time of night. Mr Farnborough is a man who is so wealthy... he doesn't know how to spend his fortune. - My offer is still open. Whenever you're ready to live it up I'll increase my bank account. Quite an offer! I see. But what exactly are you doing here? For questions of an official nature I generally refer to my solicitor. He's competent in defending my interests. If the question was informal although, I have come to inquire whether Danny received the roses that I sent. Inspector Craig meant no offence. He's just been pegged down. I'm sorry to hear it. I wish you a speedy recovery, Sir. When you made quite sure your roses are there, perhaps you can leave us alone. I trust we'll see each other soon, Danny. Some character. Now we'd better pay a visit to David Armstrong. Watch out. You do better with your arms over your head, my dear. Tell me what you think. A handsome pair of trousers. - She could do without. Wait. She's done much better. That's outrageous! Actually, it's not an awfully good likeness. How dare he! Give me the negatives. Someone saw to it. They were burned. - I could kill that Armstrong. You're not the only one. Armstrong's dead. The evidence was burned. Fortunate... A charming holiday companion. Sir John, how is it that you knew about the negatives? Where there's a positive there's surely a negative. As a youngster... I used to have an interest in photography with better results than that, however. Listen to me, Craig. I want you to stop these horrible murders. Aren't you aware of the fact that Armstrong was murdered? Yes, as well as the motive. - Indeed? Tell us. What was it? The killer had to get rid of him. Armstrong had proved that Myrna's alive. That's why the negatives were burned. - I've known that for ages. That's one of Myrna's friends, Maggie. They went to the ballet school together. And there's Mr Stout, the hotel manager. Thus, you should never ring me from there. If you didn't make yourself look so foolish, I could pity you. Playboy, that's what you should have been. You aren't good for business. As you see, Myrna Fergusson's alive. - Only one could account for it. Jim Donovan, and he's dead. - But who would have killed him? Now, we thought that was your doing, Baxter. Are you mad? Jim Donovan was my only real lead, the only person... who knows if Myrna is dead or alive. That's rather disturbing. I dare say, I don't feel very secure. First our shipment was stolen, and then there was Myrna's defection. Someone killed Jim Donovan. - You and your women are the cause of it. Why do you sleep with every ballerina? - There's no other way... of striking up an acquaintance with them. The perfect blind for smuggling heroine. Baxter, it was an idea of yours. - You know... how much I spend on Maggie McConnor? - Myrna didn't love me on account... of my blue eyes, it was my bank account. - You didn't suffer that much. As to the expense: What do you suppose your tarts will cost in the end? I guess 20 years at least. And now I'm getting out! Nobody knows I'm involved. I've been more discreet than you two. And you're in a mess, and you're welcome to it without me Now, I warn you. If my name is implicated in it, you two are in trouble. My gorillas will take care of you. What do we do? Myrna will certainly try to make contact with Danny. You having her watched? I've got her under close surveillance. Why are you here? Excuse me. I'm Danny Fergusson. Myrna, my sister, was in your ballet class. You are Madame Turina? - The name Myrna Fergusson is not... to be mentioned in this class anymore. - Why? What has she done? Myrna has nearly ruined our reputation. She was dismissed over six weeks ago. Could I speak to her friend Maggie McConnor, please? You were a good friend of Myrna's. - That's correct. I was. Please excuse the intrusion. - Once more from the beginning! Come to the "Cathay" in one hour. I'm sorry it I was rude. But in the position that I'm in... I can't afford to have anyone know that I've seen you. If I knew what my sister had done, why everyone is so... unsympathetic? That was so thoughtless. I'm certain the entire troup were shocked of the news. Six months ago the ballet was touring in the orient. When we returned home... the police found heroine in our costumes. We were all arrested. It would have been a terrible scandal, except... Myrna had the courage in the end to admit she'd smuggled it. What happened since we don't know. She was released though. Rumours have it her boyfriend bought her freedom. He's a French antique dealer called Wyman. It's a small world, isn't it? I didn't know you knew each other. London is the hub of the world. You're always bumping into people. - An accident of fate? I wouldn't have barged in on you. - When on earth did you meet her? She belongs to the Royal Ballet. - She can't be at the side of you. No. It's a pity. The more I do to interest her, the more she hates me. It's one of those accidents of fate. Money can't open every door. She finally told me that. And you, will you teach me anything, Danny? I have more important things to think of. - To learn what's happened to Myrna. And you can count on my help. What business is this? - We'll see to it later. I answer anything you ask me after you have spoken with Wyman. I'm Danny Fergusson. Surely the name... Myrna Fergusson is significant. - Should it be significant? You were very close friends. Could you tell me where to find her? Please calm yourself. - I'm quite calm, thank you. I'd rather would pursue this subject in private. Come this way. The stairs on your left. The Fergusson girl. Danny Fergusson is here. Yes, of course, I'm serious. Yesterday I learned your sister is dead. - Will you stop pretending please? You've only to tell me where to find her. - If I knew where she might be found, I'd find her. I'm most anxious to speak with her. After all, in certain circles of London's society there's panic. That's all I've got to say to you. What is it? - Your dealer is on his way. He'd like me to put the Madonna in the safe in the meanwhile. Too late, Miss Fergusson. Won't you sit down? Myrna always had high hopes for a career in ballet. But when her dreams of fame and fortune were never realised, she turned to smuggling the drugs, starting with heroine. That had it's price. As she soon learned. Her smuggling career was short-lived as well. Because she was arrested in her very first attempt. I spayed a fortune to obtain her release. Poor investment. I don't get her back. What is it? - Inspector Craig wishes to see you. Send him in. I suggest in view of this situation we do well to keep our heads. Danny! What brings you here? - Mr Wyman was a friend of Myrna's. That's why I came. - The same reason I came. You posted a large bail to obtain Myrna's release when she was arrested. What was behind all that magnificence? - Love. Only love, Inspector. That sounds noble. By the way, there's a Chinese vase you put on display which interested me. An object d'art which ought to interest Danny. Late 17th century. A splendid piece. Pity, the heroine is gone. - You wish to enquire... about it's whereabouts? We confiscated the most recent shipment. - Congratulations. But why tell me about it? I only buy vases, not drugs. You must have known that Myrna discovered the secret of your vases. Get a doctor. An organisation of heroine smugglers including Antoine Wyman were using your sister as a go-between. - Doctor Ellis convinced her to assist us. But you used Myrna, too. And when she was in mortal danger, you wouldn't help her. She saved herself. She avenged herself on the crooks who had exploited her. It was her way to fight drug addiction. - Try to understand our way of thinking. Through Myrna's help we could have cut off London's illegal drug supply... and enabled her to start a new life, too. She was to leave the country and begin a new career under a new name. She was counting on your help as well. - Something must have gone wrong. She must have lost confidence in you. She would have called for your help. We're doing all we possibly can to save her. The odds were up against her. The men who are dealing drugs had millions invested. They stand to make a fortune. They won't stop at murder to get it. And that is precicely why you must leave London, and tomorrow morning. That gang is watching your movements in the hope that you will lead them... straight to Myrna. - Will you leave tomorrow morning? You've been acting the tourist today. The Tower of London, Buckingham Palace, the Changing of the Guard, Old Carnaby St. May I have my bill. I'll be checking out. - Your stay was paid in advance. You'll find the door open, Mr Stout arrived ahead of you. Who was that? - One of the dancers of the Royal Ballet. A very intimate friend of Mr Stout. - Let's not be catty. Damn it all! We are in up to our necks. Was that idiot planning to kidnap her? I have no idea what Wyman planned. He was dead when I got there. The police would come out of the woodwork. - One after another, they're going to pick us off. We're like sitting ducks. A mess it is. But we have no alternative. The only way to get to Myrna is through her sister. And we have her cornered. - Have we now? If you only knew what a day I've had! Mme Turina had me aching from head to toe. Save the details. I have a visitor. - Are you with pigs all day long? If you'd like to get your paws on this blue ribbon meat, you're out of luck. Lover wants his Maggie to be a prima-ballerina, remember? When am I getting a solo billing, dear? - When elephants fly. Go on, Dumbo. Get out. Lover, you won't be too long, will you? You don't have to drink so much. While you are playing Casanova, Scotland Yard is probably having... a new cell made up for you. - For us, Baxter. Both of us. Inspector Craig. Maggie McConnor from the ballet is here with Mr Stout. Well, it's no business of mine. - You should find out what she's up to. Why shouldn't a gentleman enjoy the company of a beautiful woman? You know why. - It doesn't concern me. Sorry. I wouldn't loose sleep over it. I think I'll better get to the Palace. My God, he told me not to use the telephone here. Now, that bloody fool. We'll have all Scotland Yard on our backs. I won't be called bloody fool. - Just go, pour yourself a grape. I'll be curious to find out how you manage to get rid of Scotland Yard. I'll be curious to find out which of us gets the next bullet in the brain. I want the deep freeze unit sent to the Palace hotel. Be quick about it. Yes, Danny. What's the matter? - Come, get me out of here! My phone is out of order, my door locked! - Just a minute. I'm coming. Not a peep out of you. - Don't be worried about them. They'll never know you're in my room. Would you mind explaining me... - Sir! You're forgetting... that this is a first class hotel. You're appearance is inappropriate. Keep your opinions to yourself. Did Miss Fergusson leave the hotel? Then put me through to Scotland Yard. - Scotland Yard is here. Where is Miss Danny Fergusson? - She went to her room an hour ago. I can't seem to find her anywhere. She knocked on the wall for help, and when I arrived she disappeared. - Please tell Mr Stout I wish to see him. He's in his penthouse. I'll tell him. You're very wise to cooperate with us. Having a pleasant evening? Take her to the slaughterhouse. I best go on ahead. What do you think you'll find here? At the service entrance? Actually it's a long story. That's a bit rude. The story wasn't anywhere or near finished. Scotland Yard. I wish to report a murder. - I'll ring Inspector Craig if you want. Mr Stout, the manager of the Palace hotel, has just been murdered. Perhaps you could send someone here to look into it. I don't think I'd do that if I were you. If Mr Stout catches you... playing around with his fancy equipment, he's going to blow his top. His top has been blown. I hope you saw to it when his will was drawn that you are properly taken care of. - It can't be. Is this your idea of a joke? - It's not a joke. He's dead. Wasn't he here a minute ago? Well, when did he leave? No more than ten minutes ago, with a friend of his. Do you know who killed him, yet? - Who is this friend? William Baxter, the meat importer. Slip into something comfortable like a little black dress. There was no reason for you to do that! What have I done? - You butcher, you killed Stout! Stout is... I'm mad. When did it happen? Your sister will pay for what she's done. - Where have you taken Myrna? First Donovan, then Wyman and Stout. But I won't be the next on her list, not on your life! I'll make Myrna Fergusson come to me. When she finds out what you're going to do she'll appear. Put her in the deep freeze. - But she'll be dead within an hour. A lot can happen in sixty minutes. Get moving. No doubt about it. The evidence shows that you killed Stout. But, Sir John. It has been established by ballistics... that Stout's murderer was firing from a distance of a hundred feet away. If we trusted the experts we'd never solved anything. They can have their laboratories. For me statistics are rubbish. Farnborough, in my day they would have hanged you. Milton S. Farnborough came into the world on April 12th, 1928 in Zanzibar. He's the eldest son of Winston, Earl of Farnborough. And we haven't the slightest proof of his guilt. On your way. I am to extend the good wishes of William Baxter. Bill Baxter, my partner at the golf club? If you could find the time, a chat with him might be just the thing. Baxter, Beastly on the greens. It's quite a radio you've got there! - I think I'd lose my mind... without music to listen to. - When music is the heart's delight... evil is banished and trouble takes flight. You've taken leave of your senses,Craig! Bill Baxter's above suspicion. Good night, Miss Atkins. I hope you have a pleasant evening. I'll bet a ten to one that Danny is being held a prisoner at Baxter's place. You know I'd never bet with you! You Scots are notorious welshers. I didn't realise how serious you were. My dear Bill. I'd rather thought you'd be surprised. It was awfully good of you to send a message by a Mr Farnborough. He called at the Yard today to convey your best wishes. Farnborough? I'm sorry, John. I don't know any Farnborough. Won't you have a seat? - I should have known. His la-di-da was only a bluff. Even the Inspector was taken by his fraud. He said you were mixed up with these mysterious murders, Bill. You've got to be joking. This is too much! Some mad man murders my friend Stout... and Wyman and you come along with this idiotic accusation... that you heard from... I don't know who he is! Who does Craig think he is involving my name in... We aren't taking this personally, my boy, are we? It's not worth it. I'll put Inspector Craig back on the beat. I doubt if you'd enjoy yourself... butchering humans while killing is your stock-in-trade. I must say one thing in Craig's defence, if he were working for you... he'd never leave those lights burning at midnight. Shame on you. Turn the lights out! Help me someone! Let me out of here! Are you alright? Aren't you stepping out of line? I expressly forbade you... coming here interfering. Bill Baxter gave me his word... that he didn't murder Mr Stout. My subordinates exercise no restraint... in doing their duty. - He ordered to lock me in the freezer. Craig, arrest him. Or would you prefer... to have me try my hand at carving a pig? I think someone else took the honours. - It's a shame. You would have killed him in cold blood. - I'm taking you home. If you'd like to borrow a knife? - Craig, this is no time for leftie. I admit it's a rather tempting thought, given the price of meat. I'd like a nice, stiff Scotch and about 24 hours sleep. I wouldn't mind a Turkish bath for once. - I'm warm enough. The frogman have recovered a woman's body from the Thames. It appears to be the corpse of Myrna Fergusson at a dock No 37, Tell them to wait there. Is it wise... - It was her sister. The face is disfigured badly. I think it was struck by a propeller. Her shoes are from Murdock, Sydney. Could she be identified by anything else? Any marks or scars perhaps? Yes, from an appendix operation. Will you send the body to Dr. Ellis' laboratory as soon as possible? Ask him to report to me when the autopsy is finished. See to it that Miss Fergusson gets back to the Palace hotel. I'll join you there when I have the results. According to Dr Ellis' observations we're certain it was your sister's body. The blood type corresponds, the appendix soar, the approximate time... and cause of death: They all confirm that Myrna was killed in the Hotel Portland by Jim Donovan. I'll never understand it. It's been no more than a day or two... and these horrible things happened, these killings. Not only Myrna's dead, but Wyman, Baxter, Stout... the photographer. Even Donovan was killed. But why was Myrna killed? Don't worry, we'll soon know. And I'll never understand why Myrna was involved in drugs. Here, this will do you good. - They could have blackmailed her. That would explain the smuggling. - Yes, it would, indeed. And when she turned against them she was murdered. A little whiskey will do you good, too, Milton. I think we're entitled of some explanation. What is your real interest in this curious affair? I had a sister as well, also a member of the Royal Ballet, like Myrna involved in the drug traffic. They both were unwilling pawns of the organisation. My sister is dead, too. I've been trying to track down... the leaders of the drug ring on my own. But it's no good. I'm no match for them. There is always someone quicker than I am. Now, Inspector Craig, I am afraid it's your problem. Good luck to you. Perhaps you're quicker than I. - I'll try my best to be. Danny, my offer is still open to you. But I have a feeling that today... we're meeting for the last time. Please, Danny. Be on tomorrow's flight to Sydney. Will I see you again? - You bet you will. By the way, the new hall steward is Sergeant Simpson. He will be looking after you. I'll be in Stouts apartment. - Right, shall I say. This is Myrna. Myrna? - Come to Piccadilly Circus... in half an hour, without the police. Mr Simpson, do you suppose you could order me a nice cup of tea? I just can't seem to raise the desk clerk. - I'd be delighted to. Please lock the door. Hello, room service. Send a pot of tea up to Miss Fergusson's room. That's one tape I haven't had. Sorry to bother you. I must see Dr Ellis right away. - Dr Ellis isn't in now. You're surely wondering why I'm here. I meant to surprise Scotland Yard. Dr Ellis and I are planning on marrying. - Oh, I think you'll make a lovely couple. I'll wait for him then. - Could I take a message for him? No, I'll wait. That's rather splendid. Interesting piece that. - Would you excuse me a moment? Hello, Craig. What a surprise to see you here at this hour. I've something to show you, Doctor. What is this? You know that very well. One of the seals we use to label contraband drugs. Where did you get it? - That is a rather complicated story. I'll be glad to explain it tomorrow at the Yard. That's all. Why does that chime sound so familiar? This is Myrna. I must see you. Come to Piccadilly Circus in half an hour, without the police. An excellent job of solving. - That mistake of yours clinched it. It wasn't my mistake. Myrna never should have used the phone in this room. She had to be destroyed. And so are you, Craig. But an Inspector from Scotland Yard should die more easily knowing the facts. If you mean your little caper, Ellis, I don't need to be told. Myrna Fergusson was caught smuggling heroine. She agreed to work with us, but all along she was working for you. And once you replaced it with sugar, you sealed and burned it... in the presence of Sir John. You would have earned quite a tidy sum. An ingenious plan, isn't it? - And the body in the Thames? Myrna had a brilliant scheme. Donovan killed someone to take her place. They went through that farce in the hotel. And then I killed him. The girl who's body you found was a Soho prostitute. I'll make you a proposition, Ellis. Why not give yourself up to Scotland Yard and stop this senseless bloodshed? I would hate to see Susan die, too. Ellis, you're not to point that thing, for heaven's sake! It could go off! I doubt it. When Dr. Ellis' back was turned, Simpson emptied the gun. The game is over, Ellis. Go ahead, fire away. Let me show you something. I'm glad Simpson removed the bullets. - Craig, you've got a bloody nerve. Whatever that powdered sugar means, Susan has to come with me to the Yard. Myrna Fergusson's just been shot to death. Yes, Sir John. I'll change. - Come as you are, my dear. And now, in the name of Scotland Yard, I pronounce you partners in crime. These men of science know it all. They could do with less brains... and more common sense. Now, well. Good job, I caught him. I don't know what I can say, Danny. I realise you've had a rather harrowing experience, but I just hope there'll be another time. If you do come again I'll... If ever I should come back the first thing you'll take me to... are the tourist attractions like Madame Tussaud's wax museum... where we'll see Ellis along with Jack the Ripper. Funny you should mention the name of Jack the Ripper. Miss Fergusson, Bon voyage. Come again soon to swinging London. My most recent efforts show it's a fact that Jack the Ripper once lived in Sydney, Australia. And, young man, I'm dispatching you to dig to the bottom of it. Find out where he went, go to the same hotels, his favourite bars. Yes, but what's the point? Jack the Ripper died over a hundred years ago. Fiddlesticks! It's more interesting, you idiot. Your flight's called. Let's go. By courtesy of Jack the Ripper. - That's the spirit, young lady! Have a lovely time. Don't forget to write! And he calls himself a detective.
