[ Squeaking ] [ Bell Jingles ] [ Meowing ] [ Squeaking ] [ Squeaking ] [ Man ] Walter, did you run the projections on that fifth substrate? - Yeah, I ran 'em. - Hey, Spunk. I'll feed ya. I know you're hungry. You know you're not allowed up here. [ Meowing ] [ Meowing ] - This looks different. - It's not. It's got a darker hue than the last batch. No, it's the same. Professor, it's-- It's just a subjective observation. I mean, it's darker in color. I just checked it. It's fine. Walter, where's the report? I don't see the data. They're right here. [ Squeaking ] [ Bell Jingling ] [ Squeaking ] Walter, this is illegible. All right. I'm sorry. Listen, I'll, um-- I'll type 'em up after I'm done with my injections. Okay? Thank you. Professor? Hmm? Don't you need the diluted substrate numbers... that were included in the second phase results? Of course. It's not a problem. I'll add it myself. I'm not sure why I did this last series then. [ Professor ] It's fine. Did you check the traps? Yeah. Tell me you found some, Walter. I'm sorry, all right? It was an accident. Accidentally releasing animals slated for incineration? For the 18th time, it was an accident. The crates fell over. The rats got away. We're gonna find them. All right. I'll bring you your numbers. Professor? - It looks different. - It's the same! Hold still. There's no way! There's no way you bit through that glove! All right. You wanna play hardball? I got you. Right there. [ Squeaking ] [ Bell Jingling ] [ Bell Jingling ] [ Jingling Continues ] - [ Hissing ] - [ Cat Yowling ] [ People Hooting, Hollering ] [ Woman ] Finals are over. That's why we're gonna drag Walter's sorry ass out there to party with us. - What do we need Walter for, anyway? - Don't be a dick, Burke. 'Cause Alicia needs him. I don't need him. Yeah, "need" is way too strong. More like she wants to spend some quality carnal time with him. [ Laughing ] Oh, you're just jealous. Yeah, likely. If it wasn't so unlikely. Alicia, you are tired. - Who's got Mr. Tequila? - Alicia, man. She's Bogartin' the thing. You can't have any till we're there. I don't wanna be squished around a tree with you losers. Oh, warm backwash piss. Well, I'm proud of you. No. I'm gonna smack you, man! Yeah! Spank me, baby. Give me that. Uh... Frank, you're lost. - I'm not lost. - Yeah, man. The V.A.'s to the south. I'm not lost. Hey, Frank, crack that window. Get some air to your brain. I'm just checkin' out the cool sticks, man. Right. Turn around up there. Get back on the 5. Here. You want some? [ Woman ] Yeah, I guess I'm not getting any younger, and I'm in bulk erase after cramming for finals for five days. - Here's to no more finals. - Yeah! - [ Whooping ] - [ Alicia ] Yee-ha! - [ Whooping Continues ] - [ Burke ] All right! All right! [ Squeaking ] Professor, I was gonna bolt the doors. Are you gonna go out the side? Uh, yes. Thank you, Douglas. How long you gonna be, gentleman? I was thinkin' of runnin' a broom through here. Let me know, 'cause I like to run a broom through here at least once every few months. We don't make your life easy, do we, Douglas? Whiskey and a soft bosom make my life easier. Okay. Ain't got the bosom, but I got the whiskey. Ain't that right, Ethyl? It's Friday night. Time for a little party. What's that you say, baby? The drinks are on you? Well, thank you very much, darlin'. Ahhh! [ Squeaking ] You little bastards. You think you can outsmart me? We'll see who has the last laugh when I fry your hairy little asses. [ Squeaking ] Oh, yeah? Make my day. [ Keys Jingling ] [ Squeaking ] [ Rats Squeaking ] [ Cages Rattling ] [ Squeaking, Rattling Continue ] [ Groaning, Laughing ] You're mine. You're all mine. You're toast! Fried rat surprise! Fried rat-- [ Jingling ] Spunk. [ Loud Squeaking ] Professor. Professor Irwin! What is it? What do you make of this? - You injected them? - Yeah, yeah, but only Brenda with the last batch. They're reacting to the injections. [ Loud Squeaking ] [ Keys Jingling ] [ Loud Squeaking ] [ Jingling ] Aaah! [ Whimpering ] [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] [ Squeaking Subsides ] [ Walter ] God, that was so weird. You ever see anything like that before? No. Doctor, was that the normal enzyme concentration? Yes. I combined it myself. Twenty-five, fifty, twenty-five. Combined to form Rejenacyn 6. It was the same. I'm going to my office. Let me know if there's any more strange behavior when you get those results. Okay. Do you know where you're goin', Frank? That way. [ Frank ] No way. [ Scoffs ] No, man, she's right. It is right up here. I think they're lost. Yeah. So, I was thinkin'. You know, I, uh, I like you, Alicia. [ Scoffs ] Forget about it, Gary. What? There's no beginning, there's no middle, and there's no end. Come on. I just thought that-- You know, I-- I'm just not into you. Okay? So stop trying so hard. I'm not trying anything. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Fine. Cool. [ Sighs ] Walter. Did you double-check your figures? Yeah. It-- It's right. One-oh-five. The weight? Yeah, it's-- It's 105 for Brenda. Right. That's a one K increase since yesterday. That right? Of course. It's exponential growth. At this rate, in a few hours, she'll be 300 pounds. I find it hard to believe. Edema? It could be swelling, but, uh, you know, her other markups are totally normal. This massive weight gain is very striking, very unusual. Yeah, I'd say so. I mean, we didn't see anything like this in the Rejenacyn 5. The auditory enzymes were the same. - Everything was the same. - Well-- But what I don't understand, Professor, is how would the ear canal chemistry... affect this growth? They're similar to pituitary hormones. Let's monitor them four times a day for a while. I'm going home. [ Sighs ] Have you seen Spunk? No, but she's probably upstairs or something. [ Sighs ] Spunk? Spunk! [ Chattering ] All right, you guys. It's my turn now. Who's got the jug? Oops. [ Laughing ] You guys are assholes. Not to worry, honey. Where is Walter, anyway? He's this way. I'll follow you anywhere, babe. Must have got turned around. He's this way. She's fried. Yeah, I don't know how, but Professor Irwin lost his funding, and they ended up out here. Was he doing cancer research? Yeah. It's pretty amazing stuff. They had this king killer enzyme that attacks the tumor cells, but it's pretty toxic, if you know what I mean. Yeah. Yeah, how exciting. You wouldn't be talking like that if you had a tumor. He already does. Between his shoulders. [ Laughing ] Yeah. [ Laughing ] [ Burke ] This place is pretty creepy, you guys. Uh-uh. I think it's kind of sexy. [ Gary ] Sexy, huh? How 'bout we play a little haunted lab strip poker? You girls would love that, huh? You never change. [ Squeaking ] Spunk? Spunk? [ Squeaking ] [ Squeaking ] [ Squeaking ] [ Squeaking ] - [ Gasps ] - [ Beeping ] [ Groans ] [ Loud Squeaking ] [ Alicia ] You're so weird! [ Chattering, Laughing ] Walter! Shut up! [ Shrieks ] Shh! It's your mother! Come out, Walter. Give me some of that. Hey! You guys can't have this anymore. [ Laughing ] Aaah! Stay over there. Stay over there. Walt! Shh! Hey, Walt. Shh! Stay back! Stay back! Stay back! Walter! [ Falsetto ] Walter! Walt! Walt-- Walter! [ Laughing ] [ Irwin ] Walter! [ Squeaking ] Walter! [ Loud Squeaking ] [ Beeping ] [ Screaming ] [ Screaming Continues ] [ Screaming ] Help! Help! [ Screaming ] [ Jet Engine Roaring ] [ Laughing, Chattering ] Walter! - [ Alicia ] Hey. - What are you doing? I thought I'd come by and relieve you. No, no, no. Now is really not a good time. I haven't heard from you all week. I'm sorry. I've been really busy with the professor. We've been doing some serious testing. It's looking good. I can just hang out. I can be quiet. All right. Just for a second. I can be quiet. I don't know about these guys. Hey! [ Laughing ] - Where are your lab rats, man? - Shh! Please. Finals are over. It's party time! No, no, no. No. I'm still working. Come on. Let us in. Party? Come on, Walter. You're boring us. I appreciate this, you guys, I really do, but-- Lighten up, dude. Come on, man. Take a load off. I wanna see the lab. No, no. The professor's mad enough at me as it is. He loves me. I got an A in his biology class. - When was that? - Two years ago, when he was teaching. You did? Yeah, of course. Yeah, we all know how she really got the A. Forget that! [ Laughing ] [ Walter ] No! No, guys! No! [ Laughing ] Please. Stop. Stop! Walter, take a chill pill. We're here to save you from yourself. [ Chattering ] Are you mad at me? Alicia, you know I'm on the professor's shit list as it is. It's all right. We'll just be here for a few minutes. Then we'll bail. No, I can't have this right now. Baby, it's a party night. Tell me you're not happy to be here with me. It isn't like that. Hey, hey. It's you or me, man. If you lose her, she's all mine. Gary. Cut it out. What? Walter, come on. All right, listen. Give me one minute. I gotta wrap everything up. Cool. I'll stay here and make sure every-- Hey! All right. [ Chuckles ] Hey! Hey, you guys, cool it! - Anytime. - [ Scoffs ] She is trash, man. [ Frank ] You're talking about my girlfriend, man. [ Burke ] Get out of my face. Back off. Burke, don't be such an asshole. [ Burke ] Whatever. All right. Chelsea bailed on you because you cheated on her, remember? Exactly. I didn't cheat on her. I'm sorry. You were completely innocent, in bed with another chick, naked. Well-- All right. So, we move on. All right? Whatever. [ No Audible Dialogue ] Just promise me you won't touch anything, okay? Okay. Yeah, cool, man. Yeah, this is cool. I don't understand why you guys aren't on the campus. 'Cause we're not. We're here. Ooh. Testy. Professor Irwin lost his funding mandate. Why? What? No reason? It just happened, Walt? How do people lose most things? He screwed up. He didn't screw up, okay? He has this revolutionary new technique, and the university didn't think it was too P.C. [ Frank ] What do you mean, not P.C.? Like Dr. Frankenstein stuff? Does that make you Ygor? [ Gary Laughs ] [ Gary ] "Nice hump." "What hump?" [ Walter ] Guys, will you keep it down until I can lock this up? So do all the rats die? [ Walter ] Well, you know. That is so cruel. [ Walter ] That's the price you pay for lifesaving scientific research. Um-- [ Chuckles ] What happened to the end cage? What do you mean? It's all bent back. What cage? What the-- What the hell is this? - [ Chelsea ] Wild, huh? - Did you-- Did you-- Did you do this? What? I didn't do that. I just saw it like that. We gotta close the doors. Brenda got out. Brenda got out. A rat did that? [ Burke ] No way. No rat I've ever seen. Hey, Walter, is this some kind of joke or something? I think he's serious, Frank. Holy shit. Look at that cage, guys. I'm outta here. This is nuts. She's not here. She's not here. We'll search for her. We'll find her. You don't understand. I've already lost a crate of these in the basement. There's rats in the basement? Oh, God. Yes. I can't lose Brenda. If I lose Brenda, that's it. Okay. We'll find her. It's okay. We'll search for her. All right, everybody. If you find her, don't touch her. Because she's aggressive. I'll go make sure the professor's gone. If he's not, I'll get rid of him. Just stay cool. Okay. It's gonna be all right, honey. Just keep everybody low-key. All right. All right. This is nuts. This is nuts. Professor. I don't know about you guys, but rats wig me out. - Don't be such a pussy, Gary. - Guys. Oh, it's just-- It's stereotypical jock crap, you know. Well, that's what he is. Yeah. That's right. Hey, I'm not just... a jock, guys. [ Frank ] Oh. Yeah, sometimes things are the way they appear to be. - You're just jealous, Frank. - You're the dog, man. Guys... mellow. Professor? Professor? Professor. Anything? Hey, we're so glad you came back. Shut up, Gary. Hey, you guys, can we get out of here, or what? No, I have to find Brenda. You're on your own. I'm not stickin' around for this. Hey, I'll find that stupid rat. Yeah, we'll all help find her, won't we, everyone? Yeah. Sure. Hey, that sounds like a party to me, guys. A little fiesta. - Is the professor here? - Uh, no. I think he left. Did you guys see his Explorer when you came in? No, I didn't see any cars in the parking lot. All right. He said he was leaving, so I'm sure he's gone. All right. Well, where do we start? Okay. All right. Um-- We've already looked down here. So let's, uh-- Somebody can check upstairs, and we can check on this level. Chelsea and I will-- W-We'll look up-- We'll look upstairs. Upstairs. I'll just stick around here and wait till she shows up for dinner. That's fearsome, Gary. [ Scoffs ] I appreciate this, guys. I do. Yeah. So what are you doing? What? I'm looking for her. Any rat that size that breaks out, I'm not looking for it. Right. Yeah. Okay. Great. Know what I mean? I'll call you if she comes up, you know. I'll give you a phone call. Turn your cell phone on, all right? Here, ratty, ratty, ratty! Funny. What if we can't find this rat? I don't know. Let's look around and do our best. I doubt if it's easy to find a rat, know what I mean? It's just-- It's just right there. There? Yeah, it's right there. Eeee! [ Screams ] Whoa. Come on. That's not funny. I'm sorry. - [ Creature Growling ] - [ Glass Breaking ] [ Growling ] I think I saw it out here. Get out. No, I'm serious. [ Laughs, Shrieks ] Well, I guess there is a big rat. You.

They started going crazy and attacking each other when the alarm went off. I think I understand. The-- The selectrate that we used? It had a hypersensitive ear enzyme, and that could cause aggressive behavior. Wait. Did the alarm go off in the rest of the building? Because if the alarm went off in the rest of the building-- It could have been. Yeah, it could be! This could be our chance to get out of here while they're dazed. Can you make the alarm go off again? No, I don't think so. I think they're all dead. Maybe. [ Grunts ] What are you doing? Now if I just had a power source.
