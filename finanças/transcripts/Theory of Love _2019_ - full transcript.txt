He told me to come up with a film plot already Third, any idea? No idea. What about a road movie? I want to do that That's a great idea We can tell a coming-of-age story I have a plot on my mind Four strangers meet on the train on the way to the beach. They become friends when they reach the destination. That’s right. Or we can add something more. First, they are friends, But in the end when they arrive at the destination, they become a couple. Nonsense. They should stay friends What? Can I add something? I propose we go during the rainy season I have this concept: friends, train and rain. How’s my idea? I think it’s great. I like it. We can use it as the title. Let’s go to the beach this Saturday to find ideas and look at locations Fine. Don’t you bail on us, Khai Have I ever? You’ve bailed all the time to chase after girls Our trip gets canceled because of you every time Stop. I used to be that guy. But I’m the new Khai, trust me. Let us make a promise Raise your glasses. I’m making a vow. Listen to me carefully. I, Khunphol, vow to thee, my gangstas, that we’re going to the beach this Saturday No flaking out. Cheers! Shall we go for drinks tonight? I can't. I need to tend the coffee shop Come on. Fine, we three can go. I can’t either. I told you I have this Sounds Unit party to celebrate the recording of the theme song. You didn’t tell me. I did Didn’t I? Sorry, I forgot. Hello, I’m on my way. See you. I have to go now. They’re calling. Third, don’t wait up. You eat alone tonight. See you I’m coming with you. See you guys We should disperse It won’t be fun with just the two of us Two, we can go out and eat together. Cheers! Why aren’t you clinking glasses? I’m waiting for Ching Ching. Why isn’t she here yet? I heard that she may be busy She may not be coming anymore Shit, why didn’t you tell me? So we can drink now? So I can go home. Hold on, we are celebrating our work. Where are you going? Khai, I organized this party just to hang out with her. If she’s not here, what’s the point? Let’s go home Hi, guys. Sorry, I’m late. I tried to finish work early to come here because I heard you’re coming, P’Khai She’s coming on to you hard. It’ll be a long night for you. Third, what’s up with you? You seem stressed. Nothing. It’s Khai. He seems close to Ching Ching lately. So, you are worried. Mmm. It may sound stupid, but I have a gut feeling. There’s something about her Actually, I’ve heard a few things about her. She’s quite something. In what way? Seduction. No one escapes her. Actually, I don't wanna say this because I don't want to upset you. And here you are, being paranoid. That’s why I brought you here. What do you mean? Third, Two. What are you two doing here? We're having a party upstairs. Come and join us Khai is also here. Come on. We’ll join you in a sec See you soon. You brought me to the place where Khai’s party is held? Yes, I did. If you’re upset, you go up and check on him now No. You said no, but you’re quick to stand up. I’m getting beers. You can order the staff, you know I’ve ordered only two. The guy bought you more. Hello, you’re not a regular here. I come here often. Really? Who do you come with? Friends. I guess that means you’re single May I drink with you then? I’m sorry. I’m taken. I came with my friends to wait for my boyfriend And he’s here now. Excuse me. What the hell is wrong with you, Third? Go ahead! Punch me! Punch me hard! I don’t want to love you anymore. It hurts!
