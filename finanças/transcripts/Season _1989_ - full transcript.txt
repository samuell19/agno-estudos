prime amazon My name is Jeevan. It is only after two years that I can.. ..see mist on the road like this. It is only after two years I have the permission to see the road.. ..lights burning like this. Thinking that the grief that I feel is not little. But now feeling sorrow means... What happened? - Like that... How many years is it? - Two. - That is too less. After that for eight to nine months, when I come back.. ..I feel like seeing the familiar people when we come back home. That doesn't mean that I'm inside this permanently. Before this I have remained inside only once. That time it was 7 years imprisonment. In the name of good conduct after 5 years I could go back. You have put on weight. - It is due to outside food, sir. Here after I'll become slim. Hi! What man? So you came. When did you come? It is few days since I came. I was in corridor. It is only two to three days since I got cell. Where? - G wing. - Good. Come. You have learnt our language. It is now 8 months. How to survive without learning a language? How could you know that I was here? Here in manufacturing. I know. So have to come to see me only? How? Did they catch you or you got caught? Not caught. Got myself caught. How? - It was simple. A sub inspector who had thrashed me in the past, I whipped him. He lost two of his teeth. Physical assault inflicting serious injuries. Section 332. It was smooth. I came on your saying. - I know. Then you arrange for cash. - If I do that? I can take you out as I promised. Are you sure? - Yes. I'm sure. It is my word. I'll save you. I'll. But you have to arrange the cash within 5 months. Before Octobar. Fabien. Fabien Remenez. It is 8 months back that I saw Fabien. On the next day of his changing cell and coming. That day my sentence was about to end. It is going to be 5 years. Actually my punishment was for 7 years. The accusation on me was murder. Not one but three murders. But there was no proof for all the three of them. On of it had circumstantial evidence. So I didn't get gallows or life imprisonment. Section 304. 7 years. As I was a good boy I got the concession.. ..of good conduct. Two years concession. Like that there was an order to release me after 5 years. Otherwise also one month before leaving the jail is full of comfort. It is literally like left free. There is a peculiar independence at that time. Everyone is nice. When independence was in a hands distance, I felt a lot of peace. Now are you going to return to your old business or... I have not decided anything, sir. In 5 years everything would have changed, isn't it? Now compatriots may not see me as before. Nothing like that. They all know that you are not a culprit. Only on going and seeing I'll know. If it doesn't work out, I'll have to shift to somewhere else. You need not shift place. There is still ten to twelve days left. On thinking you'll find some other alternative. I don't know. Is it that Englishman? - Yes, sir. - Is he violent? - Yes, sir. Fearing no one is ready to go close. Bring him under control without standing and seeing. Tie him up. Take him to a single cell. Take him to the hospital. It is life sentence. He came only yesterday. It is the agitation of that. Whoever it may be, he is sure to create some commotion, sir. To think those 14 years has to be spent inside this. What mischief did the Englishman do? It is drugs. - On seeing I felt. The stuff of the value of 3 crores is there in his hand. In Kochi when we caught him near Bogati... - God! He had all kinds of bad elements. On catching it was fake passport. Cheating. All the cases in that section. Let him remain inside for 14 years. What are you doing this? After consuming all kinds of nonsense if you work like this, there will be stones in the rice. Don't say that I didn't tell you. What is it? - To include non-Hindus in cooking is very bad. When was he set free? - Yesterday, that is the trouble. What is the trouble in that? Why to just tie him up for 5 days? Why can't they tie him up for some days? Should it be made as 5 weeks? Why not make it as 5 months? Will there be any problem? Why this calculation of months? Why not make it for one year? Even after that 13 years remain. Guruvayoor Appa! Save me from these devils as early as possible. What about the matter of Thirumeni? If not devil, is it god? Is it same as this? - Then what? This is also theft and that is also theft. How will it be right if you say like that? Why won't it be right? Is smuggling of drugs same as smuggling of god's statue? Are you trying to say that both are the same? Is drugs and god the same? Lord Krishna! When in the custody of a thief both are the same. Isn't it? - I feel what you said is right. Hello! What is he saying? Nothing. Shall I tell him? Hearing that he'll develop enmity for me. No need for your translation. What is he? - Thirumeni. He steals gods. - What? Deities, idols of temples. - Oh... I know. - Great man. Great man. - Tell unwanted things to the foreigners. After that the people here will suffer doe livelihood. Man! Where are you going? - Only two more days,. - Lucky. Why do you feel sad that I'm going? Because you are my only friend here. I'm sad. I want to go out. I want to flee. Attend to that. Take me with you. I mean... you know my problem. - Yes. I understand. Fabien, I can save you. I'll save you. I have been here for the last 5 years. I know every nook and corner of this place. And I'm in their good books. - Yah! I know. If you give me money, I'll help you to go out. Can you really? Yah! I can. Okay, I'll give you money. - Sure? Sure? How much? One lakh rupees. Two. - No. Three. - Go up. Four. Five lakhs. Agreed. I'll take you out for 5 lakhs. When? - No this time. I have no time to plan this time. I'll go and come back. But will you? Yah! I'll. I'll come back and save you. 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18. Cut it. Cut it with full strength. What are you staring at? By evening you'll get Rs 1.20. Excuse me! Is their wage for a day Rs 1.20? It is nothing like that. - What do you mean? It can be anything above Rs 1? - How much? 1.20, 1.30. All those who work in kitchen will get 1.30. Like that there will be upto Rs 2. Those who work in the manufacturing department will get Rs 2. What happened? - Nothing. I just slipped. He is hurt on his hand. - I was working there. Slipped. Fell here. This fell on top of me. I'm alright. You can't say that you are alright. Come. You have to be given medical aid. Good morning, sir. You are okay now? - Okay. Perfectly okay. Man, I wanted to ask you something. That day I saw something coming and hitting at my pickaxe. I saw it. I heard it. "Kining". It was you, isn't it? You only threw it. Yah! You don't want me to go like that? Isn't it? The reason being you want the cash. Right? That's right. What you did that day was foolish. If you had been caught, you would never be allowed outside. You'll be permanently inside. If that happens, our mission will never take place. Yes...yes. I like you. I like you more. Because you are frank. See you.

Good shot! Come on... come on. Play man. This side. This side. This side. This side. This side. This side. Be there man. One more fellow come, we'll go. I have got no time to come for you only. Sit down. Come. That day we told you about sir's matter. About a VCR. The thing is there. - Is it Hitachi? - Yes. Does it have papers? - I has got. Don't we need to know when we are paying so much money? Is National there? - Sister, there is National, Sony. Sanio is there. Nikitasha is there. Hitachi is there. Toshiba is there. All are there. The ones with paper and the ones without the papers. Now we have met the party directly... Leave the place. There is no party or agent here. This is not a place where you can bargain like this. There is always someone watching. Standing here if you shout whether Hitachi is there or.. .. Nikitasha is there, rest will have problem. Go... go. Not that. What is he saying? Did you actually come to buy the product? - Yes. Which one? - National. We don't want paper. - No need. But the rate from what we fixed... There itself I told you not to come here and bargain. He doesn't like that. - You pay them. Is it okay? Our commission is Rs 500. That was told, isn't it? - Yes, it was told. We'll give. Pithu! That Englishman has come to sell a lens of Nikon. Give Rs 1500. Ensure that one more time. With them you bring him also to the house. If he acts obstinate saying Rs 1500 is not enough? Throw him in that sea. Hello! Kanthi, you come with Pithu. A peculiar place, God! I have only heard about it. We'll sit near the sea. - Come. Come. Sit. You come. 1500. Okay? Kanthi! - Oh... Best set. It is the latest. On saying they must understand, isn't it? Shall I pack it? There is 18,000. - If there is any fault? You can bring it here. There won't be any problem. It is your word. Porinju, take this. - No need. I'll carry. No need. He'll keep it in the vehicle. This is something that I can carry. What about us? - I'll give. - Saying like that- - Enough... enough. Keep all this outside. - You come out. What is this? - He thinks that he can dupe us. If I say I'll give, won't I give? Are we going to run away? We didn't say like that. We felt that you lacked faith in giving that product in our hand. Come. What man? - I... - Why are you here? I came to see. I came to see you. - Go... go. Go. What? - These fellows asked me for commission. I won't pay commission. It is straight between you and me. Go... go. - Straight to you. No commission. - Go man. Go man. Move him away from here. - Go... go. Those were the days when they had started coming here. That was a grand arrival. That time Kovalam had not become Kovalam. It was in the process. It was- What about that Australian woman? The thing that she did. In the eye hospital if doctor Abraham.. ..Thomas had not been there, I would have lost both these eyes that day. One Abraham Thomas doctor. - Aiyoo! Abraham Thomas... You tell this. Where did you meet? There. On the backside of the light house's downside hill. There was high tide. The girl was going crazy. But she was an English woman. That is because she is of Australian breed. But crazy. What do you mean by crazy? Only on a slippery rock she'll perform. Waves must keep lashing. Waves must keep lashing. Brother... - Initially I tried to stop her. She was not ready to listen. Then I don't know when I remember inhaling something that she had brought. Then I also felt like entering the waves. Then what? Till dawn we were having fun in the waves itself. - Naughty! Everything was very nice. After sunrise when I woke up.. ..and saw she was not there. To see whether she was there I had no eye sight. I'm leaving my bike here. I'll be back after a couple of weeks. Okay? - Okay. Have a nice time. Who knows to which country she belongs and to which category she belongs? She made me in this condition. Hello! Nice girl, sir. Kerala girls, sir. 12, 13, sweet 17. Nice girls. You man I thought. You have got huts? - Yes. You have got? What is that? We don't mean room. Cottage like. Yes, cottage. Cottage. Huts. ITDC, KTDC. Hut, sea side. Everything ready. Cheap. We want cheap room. Not much money. No rupee. If you don't have money, why the hell did you come here? See, you want only cheap cottage, isn't it? - Yah! Only cottage. No room. Rs 25 per day. Ra 25 is too much. I'll pay Rs 20. Okay, Rs 20. But Rs 20 is for the room only. No bathroom. No bathroom? - No attached. You come and see. Okay, let us go and see. - Come. Once you go out till you arrive, the ones here feel tensed. What for? - Due to this powder business. If police catches you won't see outside world. During the other business there was peace of mind. You are talking as if you don't know anything. On selling one packet of ganja, what will I get? Hiding from police if I sell, I'll get one or two rupees. In this brown sugar business I'm able to make Rs 500 to Rs 1000 at one go. You can keep saying. - There is no grass business in Kovalam anymore. Everyone has changed to powder. Oh God! - These children will take my beating. Sister pricked me with pencil. I didn't do anything. It is he who broke the glass. I'll teach you a lesson. - Aiyoo! - Don't whip him. Be quiet. Come here. - Aiyoo! - Don't hit her. Leave her. You don't give a single minutes peace of mind. Rascal! Why are you beating the children? Once your father died, you have started. I'll hit you. - You should get two of these girls married. If you also start like this? Mother is saying like this due to fear. Other than this why don't you do some other business? If I don't do this business today, you'll have to go for.. ..prostitution in Kovalam. I can't bear to see that. Here a man like me can get only this job. Or else I'll have to walk around saying nice girls. Kerala girls. Shall I tell you a secret? Shall I tell? Come here. - Hey! God! What is this? If any Englishman sees this, he'll photograph this. You won't even know. You continue. Uncle! I was told that you enquired about me. Who told you? - Somebody told me. No. - No? - No. - In that case you enquire. If you don't give any good job, I'll have a tough time. Even if I didn't enquire I was planning to meet you tomorrow, Kanthi. Tomorrow will you go to Varkalari. - For what? I'll give you address. There is one Sadananthan boss there in Latha Nivas. Hid son-in-law has brought one video camera. Pay money and get that. - Shall I go early morning? - Okay. Take our vehicle. Take 1149. - No need. I won't get inside that Muchu Annan's vehicle. In that case you take the key of the car from Muchu Annan. Okay? - Thank you. Before keeping the product in the.. .. vehicle, you take the commission. How much I should take? - Take Rs 1000. At night will you be there? - Yes. I'll come and take the address. - Okay. Whose address? - In Latha Nivas Sadananthan boss. Do you know what the prize money is? Mr. Kanthi will return back to Kovalam at 11 AM. With an amount of Rs 1000. - What for you are going? I won't tell that. That is trade secret. - Secret! As if no one here knows anything. As he is the party it won't be brown sugar or ganja. He doesn't do that kind of business. His business is foreign currency and foreign goods. Do you know how much he has earned? Three of his tourist taxis are plying in Kovalam. On the other side of the church a hotel is being built. Is it for him? Is it so? Somebody told. Why is he accumulating money like this? He doesn't have wife or children. His story is a peculiar story. He was in the first batch of those who came to Kovalam. They say that he came in 70's to 75's, during the hippies time. He came empty handed. - From where? They say that from Thangacherry. Some say or Fort Kochi. I heard some people say as Kannur. On asking he'll say all these places name. Kanthi, are you both here? I was searching for you. I'm leaving? - What? Are you leaving? - I have work. In that case you go. When men are talking serious.. ..business what is the job of women? What is that important business? Didn't you find any other time to intrude? Brother, don't get angry. This is a matter by which a family will get rescued. Tell me. - Will you get angry? - No, you tell me. In that powder you give me also one packet. I'll give the money day after tomorrow. Have you also started? This is a serious matter. You have got wife and children. I know everything. I have to survive. All white skinned people are asking for powder. Give me one cover and see. It is for livelihood. Do the business of this carefully. It is not like the other thing. You know, isn't it? - I know. Don't keep crying. Hey! Come and hold him. If you don't want, you need not drink. You lie there and cry. What are you doing this? From morning you are sitting with some coffee powder.. ..turmeric powder and chilli powder. What kind of disease is this? - That of hunger. You won't understand anything, donkey. It is when lakhs get piled up that your eye balls will pop out. Powder... powder... Go away. I'm not interested. Powder... - No, please. Powder... powder... - Have you got powder? - Yah! Powder. Heroine, brown sugar. See this. What is the price? - Rs 250. - No. Rs 80. Sir, I have two children. - We have got only Rs 80. No please. Please. - We have got only Rs 100. - Okay, give. Thank you. That was good music. - Will you dance? - No way. Do you want anything else? - Give me one more egg. Give back the money. - What money? Give back our rupee. Rs 100. You gave money and I gave you powder. What powder? - Original powder. This is Kovalam. No tricks here. No money. Go. Go... Go. Excuse me! You just wait. I'll come. Okay? - Okay. Give back the money. What is the matter? What is the matter? This guy is a fraud. He sole us chalk powder. What have you done this? Early morning what nonsense is this? Yesterday I gave them a cover. After consuming that they are trying to show their act on me today. You leave him. - You get lost. You have no business. I have some business. It is my restaurant. You leave him first. - Leave me. Leave him. Give back my Rs 100. Get that bastard. Catch him. Catch him. Within 24 hours you'll have to leave this place or you'll be killed. Uncle, why are you giving him time? Kill him now itself. I'll give you 24 hours time. Okay? This is Kovalam. No tricks here. Go. Go away. Go... - They should be killed and thrown away in sea. Foreigner is trying to act smart. Run away. - Go... I got in just now. It'll be leaving soon. Get down. - Are you acting smart? - Where are you leaving? You came to enjoy, isn't it? Next season you come with a good boy. This is Kovalam. Don't try any tricks. Go away. Your bones we break away. Ooh... Come out, dirty fellow! - Come on. If you want to fight, we'll fight. If you promise to live decently.. ..I'll get you a hut in my expense. Are you coming? He'll beat you also. - I said just for the fun of it. You fool! - Go away. Go. - Ohho... Nasty creatures! - Go away. - Get down and come. You chase, I'll smash you. Come... Come... come... Ohho... There are some regulations here. If that is not followed here, there will be problem. You beggar's son! Are you asking accounts from me? I didn't wander around the sea side like you. When I was young I went inside sea and earned daily Rs 40 to Rs 50. That times Rs 50 is equal to how much now? If you know calculation, you tell. What is this? At mid night you, father and son get drunk like this and create commotion. You won't flourish. - No need. Don't say unnecessary thing. See here. Is there any smell? You are a good boy, isn't it? I'll slap you. There is no smell because you didn't drink. If not drunk, you would have consumed drugs in powder form. Else you would have taken it in pill form. Standing without any guilty feeling are you trying to scold me for drinking toddy? I'll kill you. - Why to blame him alone? What else can you do other than to sell Ganja, powder.. .. and whatever you get and wander around? You'll talk all the languages on the earth and do all the dirty things. Like that Wilson or like Gobi. Other than some 5 or 6 of.. ..them all the others here are gone including you. Say like that. It is only you who gave birth, isn't it? Then you only tell him. - If I didn't do any work, in the.. .. last season how did I earn Rs 10,000? Where is that now? - With that money only we repaired the tiles of this house. Don't you remember? - Money will come and go. This same Rs 10,000 can be Rs one lakh in this season. By selling powder he is going to make one lakh profit. Go man. If there is luck and the season is good we might get money.. ..to not only repair the tiles of this house but to decorate this house with gold. Do you know that? Rajendran, who was a drug addict, what is his condition today? How did Kasim become a contractor? You neither have to become a big man like that nor earn money like that. Very good. Very good. "It turned out to be a good thing." By selling powder he is going to become a millionaire. The commission to show is different and the commission.. ..if business is done is different. I told you that I'll give. Why are you going on nagging? After going there if you talk this and that and the business.. .. doesn't take place, you can come back. Without eye sight if I get trapped there, I'll have trouble. That is why I said that the commission for that is different. If you repeat this, I'll kick you. Okay, come. - Come this way. - Let him go inside that. Tell your servant to wash your linen. Not me. Who the hell are you? What do you think you are? Not your servant. Slave. You are slave. My slave. Go and call your big mother as slave. What do you want? - Powder... powder. Yes. - You got powder? - Yah! What powder? - Brown sugar. Original stuff. Rs 250 for original cover. One gram. Good stuff. This fellow agent? Hey! Agent? - Yah! Send him. Ask this guy to go. Fearing that he'll have to give something to others. Go. Send him away. Keep this. - What is it? Commission for showing. My dog will take your Rs 10. If the business takes place, I'll take the commission of that and then only go. Brother, we'll give. You go. Go. - Give this. For the timebeing you take this. Let us talk to him. First let the deal take place. Actually this- - After the deal gets fixed and you try to.. ..sideline me, I'll get you all caught by the police. This business. I commission. No. You police. Big. Custody. Get lost, idiot. - He didn't say anything. He didn't say anything. Can you supply in bulk? Bulk. - Yes. - I say in bulk. How much. He is saying that this meager amount is not enough for him. How much we'll give, I should say? Say that we'll give as much as he wants. If I say like that... - You tell him. How much? - Any much. In bulk. - In kilos. - Yah! You mean in kilos? - Yah! - Price of one kilo. Roughly 1.5 lakhs, Indian rupee. 5 kilos. 7.5 lakhs. Can you supply in kilos? What is he saying? What is he saying? He says that he'll give 1.5 lakhs for a kilo. Say that we'll supply. - From where? You tell. We'll make a try. We give you in kilos. - How much? How many kilos can you supply? How much kilos you want? Get out, both you guys. Get out from this place now. Business in bulk- - Come to that beach. 5 o'clock, evening. We talk. Okay? - Okay. And don't bring the other guy. Specs one. Will that foreigner have money? He is sure to have. Or else will he say like that? If he is making a fool of us? After saying that you come to beach at 5 o'clock. Come to some other place in the morning. Saying like that he can make us wander. Will he do like that? - It is their matter. We can't say anything. After saying 7 lakhs for 5 kilos if he tells us to bring.. ..5 kilos, from where will we get it? That is right. Let us see how it proceeds. Hi! So how many kilos do you want? Are you ready with the stuff? - Yah! I need upto 5 kilos. Any supply? - We give one kilo. Agreed. If it is one kilo, it won't be 1.5 lakhs. I'll give you one lakh rupees plus Rs 25000. No. You said that for one kilo you'll pay 1.50 lakhs. No bargain. I'll give you one lakh rupees plus Rs 25000. This business is- - You supply in bulk. I'll give you more rupees. The risk is the same. You carry both. Same for one kilo and 100 kilos. What is he saying? - Now he is saying that if it is one kilo.. ..he won't pay 1.50 lakhs. He'll pay only 1.25 lakhs. If we supply more, he'll pay more money. Reason. - Whether it is one kilo or 100 kilos if caught, the risk is going to be the same. So he is saying that he'll pay more only if we give more stuff. What he is saying is right. Let it be 1.25 lakhs. Ask him whether he has got the money. Okay. When you want stuff? - In one week. 7 days. We go after one week. - Alright. We give you powder in one week. But have you got cash? - Yah! Tell that we want to see. - We want to see. What? - Your cash. Because we take money on loan. Interest. Heavy interest. So... God! It is dollar. This comes to ten to fifteen lakhs in Indian rupee. He is a shark. - Yes. Hey Merlin! Come, let's go. Okay, guys. You have got 7 days. We'll get your stuffing in one week's time. If it works out, this will be lottery. Don't keep saying if it works out, we have to make it work. For a chance like this only we keep waiting for a season. That is right. Get stuff from somewhere. Do the business by selling the stuff and get money. He has got money. - If we can arrange for the money, we.. ..can go to Goa, Bangalore or Kannur and get the stuff. We can catch hold of some parties. Here the matter is how to arrange for money. We'll get money from some one in this shore. This is a condition like that. God has brought him to us. Best chance. - It is a chance. If it works out, I'll get both my sisters married off. You wait and see. He has got money. We saw that. Have you thought well about this matter? First thing when you have business with these high level parties... If you give us the capital amount, we both will finalize this deal. Then the condition will change. - If you complete this deal? With that money we'll try to start a decent business. Leaving this we'll shift there. - Will you shift? What is the doubt in that? To change business how much money you'll need? I need an amount to buy a vehicle. I'll earn a living by driving that. What about you, Porinju? - I have got two sisters. If you say, we'll get the Englishman here. No need. At this time we need not see each other. I'll give you money. How much you'll need? If we could do a business of 3 to 3 kilos... 3 kilos? - As he said it is anyway risky. If we also show courage... He said that if it is 3 kilos, he'll give 1.50 lakhs per kilo. Before coming here we met him one more time. If you say 3 kilos, it will be 4.50 lakhs. 4 lakhs. - Yes. How much money you want me to give you? - 1 lakhs. In a weeks time this 1 you can take back as 1 When will you be leaving? - In the night train. Are you also going? - Yes. You come and take the money in the evening. I'll tell Pithu. If you need to go to Goa and nothing else works out, there.. ..is one Joettan from Kannur. An old man. He is also in this line only. Shall we tell your name? You can tell. Once he has come here and stayed. Okay. If everything goes off fine, next week at this time Kanthi would have bought a car. Most probably when I register the car, I would register you also and take ownership. Aiya! - It is true. Only if you register the car you can register the girl. If not? - Then you won't get. If you continue with this.. ..business, which girl will come to live with you? With this you eave this line. I'll end this. "Go and come... go and come... Go and come." "Go and come... goand come..."

Does anyone know about your arrival with this stuff? Nobody knows. We didn't even go home. Only after finishing this deal we both will be returning home with money. After that only we'll celebrate in Kovalam. Now only uncle knows about our arrival. From where did you get this? - Don't ask. Even after going to Kambath when we didn't get the stuff.. ..we thought we won't get. Finally we went to Goa. It is from there that we got. Uncle, the Joettan about whom you told is dead. When? - One week before we went. Is it? - Yes, we went and enquired about him. Did you meet that Englishman? No. We first came here. We'll go and tell. You must exchange the stuff carefully. Nobody should know. - Okay. As far as possible don't fix the place where he tells. It should be in the place where you tell. - That is fine. - Then you leave. Good. Six bags like this? - Yah! 3 kilos. All bags same stuff? - Same. For 3 kilos I'll pay you 4.5 lakhs. Okay? - Okay. So... when will you give it? He is asking when we'll handover the stuff. No need to give it here. - No. Tell a time after sunset. - At 9 o'clock? That time only there won't be any crowd. Which place? Below light house. Somewhere behind the rock. Is it fine? We meet 9 o'clock at night. - Okay. There is light house near rocks. You know the other beach? Yah! I know the place. Come with cash. - Yah! I'll come. We sit like this with a cigarette. - Both you? - Yes. - Okay... okay. He is not to be seen. - He'll come. Oye! Wait. Where are you going? I came to sell this. - No sell at night. Go... go. I want to sell this. I want money. Rupee. Take this and give me rupee. No need. You go and come in the morning. No business at night. - But I want cash. This is a real nuisance. You leave the place. Here. It is equal to 5 lakhs Indian rupee. - I know. Bring your master. I won't go. I'm telling you to go. Go. You touch me? - No, I... - Did you touch my body? No, only hand. - Are you trying to rape me? - No. See you. - See you. Okay. Give back the money. Don't move. Give money. Or I'll shoot. Run... Arrange all that quickly. Thanks. Give that money. - It is with me. I won't give. - Give it to me. I'll keep it. - It is safe. Let me keep it. - No. I'll keep it. The key is here with us. We'll take it with us. You are not coming. You are staying here. Give the key. Fabien. - We part here. You bitch! Give the key. Have you seen before? - I think I have seen. If yes, you say as yes. - Yes. Three to four days back I.. ..saw an foreigner going this way with lengthy hair and beard. Have you seen him before? - Yes, I have seen him once.. ..before when he came here with a camera arguing. You wait here. You go to your house. You can return to this place after I tell you. Did you lose anything? - No. Don't tell about this to anyone. Go. Is it Kanthi? - Yes. I went in search of you to the shop. I didn't find you there. So I came this way searching for you. What happened? - Lost. Everything is lost. Porinju is also gone. He was a betrayer. Then? - He shot Porinju and threw him in air. You come. Where is he? Where is he? Who? - Fab. I don't know. Where is he? - I don't know. It is she who has entered that house. On inflicting pain she'll tell. Only if real pain is inflicted she'll tell. She knows everything. You handle her in a real manner, Uncle. In that time I'll search for him. We shouldn't waste any more time. Isn't it Thiruvananthapuram route? If it is a bike, he is sure to go only that way. From the stand you take one of our vehicles. Tell me. Was it not you who broke inside here? If you don't tell the truth, your flesh will burn under this. Was it not you who stole from here? Are you not a Malayali? What is your name? Annie. - The real name. - Merlin. Where is your house? - In Mumbai. Papa is from Kochi. Mother of a Maharashtrian. I'm from Mumbai. Where are the things that you stole? - He took it. Did he take them away? Don't you know where he went? - No. Come on. - No. Even if you burn me, I can't say that. Because I don't know. Upon god. I don't know. There is no use of searching him in airport or railway station. He'll keep going in his bike. He is a moving devil. The possibility of his going is where? Don't you know? He can go anywhere. He may go to Kolkota, Port Blair.. ..Pakistan border, Karachi, Nepal, Goa. He may go to any place. Thank you. When that was in your hand, it was irritating. Especially... It is how long since this bike came? - I don't know. It is how long since the gate has been closed? It has been quite some time. Porinju has not returned till now, brother. Where has he gone? - If you ask me, how do I know? You know. Only you are not telling me. - Shuck! Now it is 9 days. At home no one is having any comfort. It is mother who told me to come here and enquire. If you come and ask here, I have not sent him anywhere. You are not telling me. You know where he is. What is the matter, Salomi? Where is your brother? From last few days he is not to be seen. - I don't know. Get up! That boy's sister has come to the shop enquiring about him. She doesn't know about her brother's death. It is a family living in his support. The one who went is also not to be seen. I was about to ask you? Did you friend who went, come back? No. - He shouldn't have gone. I feel afraid thinking about him. Why? - It would be good if they don't meet. If they meet... He is a killer. He doesn't have any hesitation about killing. Till he returns you won't go out of this room. If he doesn't return? - You'll also be not seen in this room. Did you hear? - What? - Porinju's body has appeared on the sea side. Nobody is ready to go close. Everyone is waiting for the arrival of the police. If police asks, what should I tell? Is it enough if I say that I don't know anything? You don't know anything, isn't it? - God promise! I don't know anything. Then you say that. - Okay. He was the only earning member. All of them took him away and killed him. My son! My kid! My Porinju! I don't know whether it is right or not. I heard a news. Next to Attin in a level crossing your car is lying. Kanthi's body is there inside the car. Somebody has stabbed him. You move away from here. In the first round action police.. ..won't pay heed about who and what. Why should we move away? - Not that... No need for that. Where are the others? - They left. - If you want, you also leave. Shall I close down the place? - What for? If you are scared, you leave. - I won't go like that. You! I told you. He'll kill. I know. Go away. Go away somewhere. I'm unable to strangle you. That is why I'm saying. Go away somewhere. - Where to go? - Anywhere. We are all going to get arrested now. I won't hand over you. One day I brought you here. But if I get arrested, I'll tell everything. I'm not locking the door. Is what I heard true? - I also heard like that. You heard. Don't you know anything? What do you mean by asking like that? - You know everything. You are standing as if you know nothing. Go away from here. - I know. Without your knowledge.. ..my Kanthan's dead body won't come inside your car. You know. - Actually he- - You won't tell the truth. There is nothing called truth in your life. Money is enough for you. For making money you got my Kanthan in trouble. Come here. Come this side. - Leave me. - Come. Put the shutter and move away from here. They are coming in search. - Me? - Yes. There is a full gang. It is better that you leave the place. Close the shop and go in hiding. Hey! Hey! Hey! Sit down, you rascal! Come on. You scoundrel! Who do you think you are? Do you think you can do anything? What is this? What is the police doing this? He is the man who runs that restaurant. Come on. It is that girl's death which put me inside this for 5 years. They didn't have any proof to connect the other two murders with me. Not only me. But they couldn't connect anyone with that. On telling about Fabien Remenez I felt that policemen found it as a joke. They could take it like that only. Reason being Fabien was not a prey that they could bite. After 5 years when Fabien again came in front of me, I.. ..knew even if I had pointed out to the police that this.. ..is Fabien, there won't have been any use. Reason being I had no proof against him. Not even one. Inside the jail Fabien was safe like a king. Inside that I couldn't have done anything to him. I didn't have the patience to wait for 14 years for him to come out. That is how it became my necessity to bring him out. In the eight months that I was outside I had planned everything. Date, person, time and everything. You promised me that you'll inform me the date today. My cash is ready. You wanted me to arrange the money before October. I have arranged. - When? - Any time. It is ready there. On coming out is there arrangement for that to be delivered? Yes. Then you wait for one more week. You arrange it on October 2nd. - October 2nd Here on that day there will be festival. Gandhi Jayanthi. Gandhi Jayanthi? - Yes. The end of that investigation must be able to change the heart of the man. Self realization. Change of heart. We have got the luck of following the principles of Mahatmaji. What is soul and what is God? What is it that we call as salvation? God is inside us. Inside all of us god is there. Or else god is taking form inside us is the truth. We must realize that. How should we realize that? First we must try for self realization. Saying this I end my speech here. Jai Hind! Next item is prize distribution. For that I invite the honorable jail IG. Next item is prize distribution. It is the jail IG who is going to distribute prizes today. Those who will be getting prize.. ..should reach the left side of the stage immediately. There is no time. Those who are eligible for prize should.. ..reach the left side of the stage. After taking prize they should go to the right side of the stage. Honorable IG has to take part in another function after this. So those who will be getting prize should reach the left side of the stage immediately Ravi Kumar. The next item is finishing speech. Tomorrow morning when I come you tell the information. You go without getting angry. I'm not getting angry. Whatever I had to say has been told by Swamiji. With this I want to end my speech. To express our gratitude to that Mahatma for getting.. ..independence for our country. We take this opportunity.. ..and celebrate the day in this manner. We should never forget that great man. If you drink arrack, it should remain in stomach. Instead of stomach will it remain in respiratory pipe? The axel of the vehicle got broken. You might have to push it. Didn't you bring anyone from your house? Move the vehicle. Don't get angry. First let me see whether it is starting or not. This vehicle has some problems. Pithu, here after I'll drive. For the dealings here after we two are enough. If there is a third person, the one who comes with the cash might have doubt. You are right. Absolutely right. He is expecting only two of us. Stop the vehicle. I'll reach before sunset or else by night. Ask Indra to wait in the sea shore. How much ever I might get delayed, tell her that she.. .. should go only after meeting me. I have told. - Even if she makes haste to go, don't allow. I have to settle a debt with her. Hey! Are you becoming emotional? Will you get bus from here? - I'll go. - Come on. We'll meet. Where is the cash? Get me the money. It is ready. I want to make a call. Once I phone he'll bring cash. Stop the van in a telephone booth. Okay. Yes, hotel. We'll come. Golden Valley. Yes. Come, cash is ready. Afim. Laurence. Okay. Okay. Let me count and see. Count it. I appreciate you in a manner. You are faithful. The money that you stole from my house you gave back to me. That too with reasonable interest. Thank you. What do you mean? - I'll tell. In the year 1982 in the Hawah beach there was a tea shop. Jeevan's sea resort. You don't remember, isn't it? If I tell the name Merlin Simon, you might remember. You made that girl break open my house and stole 3 lakhs. Like killing a mosquito that day you killed two youngsters.. ..there and went away. Do you remember that? By rescuing you I took this money for the family of.. ..Kanthi and Porinju, where there is no earning member today. I don't want this. It is you that I want. In the name of the girl who consumed poison due to you my life got destroyed. Do you think I'll bring a bag like this to carry money for you? I brought it for this. I don't need to do this. But I want this van. But now that I know your dirty tricks.. .. I'll always be restless when I remain in the resort. I'm sorry for you, Jeevan. Stop the van. Stop it! Get out. Out. Till I compelled Indira and handed over that money I didn't have any peace. It is a big thing that she took it. Now the marriage of Salomi and Mebel will take place. Indira is also sure to find someone. Again I'm going to lose the street lights. This time I don't know it'll be for how many years. But this time I have a comfort. There is no circumstantial evidence against me. All that which is there are evidences. Evidences in my body and shirt. Compared to the other one there is lot of pleasure in this. All go back. Where is the other guy? The Englishman who escaped with you. He is there.
