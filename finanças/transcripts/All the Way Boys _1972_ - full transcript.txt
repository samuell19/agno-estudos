You know, you're right. You really look like a usher. He's Plata. He's Salud. LET'S GO TO THIS, BOYS! Hey, Mr. Agent. We found this 200 km from here. Take care of that, okay? Thanks. Uncle Salud! Clarita. How are you things with you? - And where are your sisters? - In school. They'll be back soon. - How's it going here? - As usual, everything is fine. Clarita ... The medicine. One more attack? - So, father ...? - It's the usual story, isn't it? Listen, Nasen. If you weren't so liar, you would admit that you expected the plane could get here. You hired us to do a work and we do our part. So, stop it and do your part. - What did he say? - That you owe us 250 each. Pay there, dad. Come on! - Yes! Pay us! - You too, now? There is no more respect. I think it doesn't cost nothing to write a check. - Do you accept a check? Yes? - It's ok. No! I want cash! And if you don't pay me ... Ingrid! Maria! Did you miss me? - And thou? Is it also one of your daughters? - Lolita? - 250 for each one. - It's good to have coverage ... It's good to have coverage! Here. - See you later. - Bye. Wait! - Hello, Plata. - Hello. May I help you? May I help you? Yes, of course you can. - Hello, Plata. - Hello. Hey, is Salud here? I've seen that it is ... No cheating. What are you going to do with it? With him...? Nothing. Angry. Not bad. Not bad. - Big move. - How about a little game? - And why not? - I play too. - But didn't your head hurt? - No. I never felt better. He's a buck. 100 per game? - Putt. - 100 per shot. Get away. No... Have you heard of Nasen's latest? - What? - Checks were not covered. - And how did you lift it? - I lent it to him. The bastard! Can I? And what interests you? You still have your money. But it is worse to receive it. He wants us to do it a favor. Look at this... Listen, he's going through for difficulties. You already got it. You gave me the headache. "Sure! We crashed the plane and we get the insurance money. " "Clean and safe work." I explained it to you. He's really close. If the damage is not enough and if the insurer catch us, we end up behind the grids. We still end up in the morgue. - It's ok. I do it myself. - You can be sure of it. And then? I was just going to come by. - Destiny Pay off? The crew? - It's us. - Do you have any objections? - It's fine by me. - Put me on the list. - It's already in it. - Who gave you this flight plan? - The guy who called last night. - Who? - I did it. I thought, "What if Salud changes his mind? ideas? "Didn't you say you were coming? No ... I mean, yes. That is for me to decide. Do me a favor and cross it out his name. - Give me a pen. - I do not have any. - I have one. - He didn't ask you! Nasen gave you money enough for the return? - Hey, I'm talking to you. - What? - The money for the return. - We called when we got there. - Do you know where we're going to fall? - South of Saldarem. It's a little off the beaten track, but close enough to the city. We got there in half an hour. Turn on the radio and give this location as a reference point. It will give a better impression if think that we fell here. Have you ever imagined if we fell right there? I am? From here Delta Bravo Foxtrot Tango calling the base Marantao. - Did it seem dramatic? - Yes Yes. - Delta B. Foxtrot Tango to call. - From here Marantao. I hear you. From here 619 Delta B. Foxtrot Tango flying from Manzapa to Saldarem. Our route is 3-3-0. The system hydraulic is pouring. Do you hear? We flew with difficulty. Reception is poor. Our Estimated location is ... - What do I tell you? - The truth. We're really going to fall. From here 619 Delta B. Foxtrot Tango flying from Manzapaaaaaa ... ... to pay off. To pay off. Our route is ... 3 ... 3 ... 3 ... 3 ... 0! My God! They are over the jungle. - Try to know their position. - You have to give me your position. Estimated position:latitude 5 25? south, longitude 61 8? west. They are more than 300 km from here. Can you hear me? I know, Einstein. Now take us away hence! We're losing altitude! - Hurry up with that. - Why? Because we are losing altitude. I know. That's what I've been telling them. I am? I am? Nasen ... "Clean and safe work." It's a flying trap! My goodness! Oh, my rich God! - Are you afraid? - No! Salud ... Salud ... Salud? Hey, Salud. Salud! Were you afraid? And you already were. Now it's your turn. Excuse. - What is the problem? - It's just glass. - It looks real. - It looks real, but it isn't. It's hard to say on the street ... Hey, tell your friend to have watch out for piranhas. - Salud ... - What's it? Be careful of piranhas. You must be the 2 pilots that fell in the forest a month ago. How do you know? News travels fast in the jungle. And I read that in a newspaper in the village. - They were reported missing. - How many mines are there around here? - Too many. - How far is the village? It will take two days on foot. - Which way? - Over there. There is no road, but you can't be wrong. - It's malaria, isn't it? - No. They fought last night. They drink and get drunk. And drunk fight. And someone always dies. - Because! - Alcohol is a problem here. It kills more people than malaria. What is the problem? - You don't drink, do you? - No. I suffer from malaria. But I am not worried. Worse already passed. I will survive. I also want to survive. No offense. - A jukebox here in the jungle? - Yes, Mr. Ears treats us well. - We even have comic books. - Ears? - Who is Mr. Ears? - Eats. Look for what you will find. Find and sell. And Mr. Ears will buy cheap. - Are you a miner too? - Yes. You say the miners compete with each other, but not with Mr. Ears? Yes. It's like the dog and the cat. - But the stones are small. - What kind of stones are they? Usually emeralds. But is difficult to find a valuable one. What counts here is the amount not quality. - And Mr. Ears is the only buyer? - Exactly. I mean you were here 14 years old and you never found anything? Oh yeah. I found many. A deposit of precious stones. You can dethrone King Midas. A talking dog. Hello, dog. - That's weird... - What? He usually doesn't like of city people. We already missed this smell for more than two months. - He's a nice dog. Does he hunt? - Oh yeah. Emeralds. - Do you plan to stay here? - Yes, during the weekend. Look who's here. Are you hungry, Lindberg? - There are always dishes for me to sell! - Thanks. These are the two airmen who thought the jungle was a clue? - Yes, the Lindberg brothers ... - It was a big fall. How will managed to get out of there? That was not difficult. The cockroaches pass anywhere. - Do you think he makes fun of us? - No... Come on, Lindberg. See how easy it is? You bullshit ... That was not pretty. - He did stay. - Take care of him, okay? - Who? I? - Yes. You just finished eating. Come on! - You must be kidding... - Come on ... You can't just kill people because you don't know how to walk. - You should thank us. - Yes, it is already a principle. Come on, smart guy! What are you waiting for? This cuts really well. - Whatever you do, don't count on me. - Come on, you toscaria. Are you ready? Hey, if I admit that you have why do you leave me alone? What am I right in? In all. In all? No no no no... Not bad for a Lindberg, is it? Cut this ... I bet yours friend is good at playing darts. Your... Well, apparently not. You don't want to play with them. They are bad. - Who is that? - They're in luck, it's Augusto. He takes you to the city. He always returns without a load. Hurry up, Plata. We're shaken. Did we stop? Do not. You are in your right. Hey, I'll show you a trick. Here. Now go! It is. Come on ... Are you ready? Now you attack, I give you one kick in the belly, another in the mouth ... And you lose a tooth ... Now, attack. Go on. A kick in the belly a kick in the mouth ... Now see that tooth there. If it's shaking, pluck it. Now there it is! Not bad, is it? It always works. - Hey, Plata! - Just a minute. - Come here. - No. - Listen, come here. - Plata! Just a minute. - Do you work for that guy too? - It's better than working against it. All who supply the miners work for Mr. Ears. Working on your own does not it's very healthy around here. Ears doesn't like competition. Going for a drink? I don't know why this Ears is bothering you. Some say that Mr. Ears is a great supplier. He has many planes, but you need pilots. If you want I can talk to you. Mr. Ears will pay you well. What they say? - It's ok. - We are not interested. Hey, listen ... 50% in society ... It means that we both decide. - Are you interested? - Who, me? Do not. Well, if you change your mind ... What interests us right now it's a phone. I am? The senor of the call long distance, where is it? Senor ... Come here. For you, senor. I am? Clarita, how are you? Well. We're fine. How are you and Uncle Salud? Everything is fine. It's Clarita. - Give the phone to your father. - Were you worried about us? - What? Who is taking care of you? - What is she saying? - Aunt Alice is there. Great. - Hey, what's up? Shut up! I can not hear! Yes, Salud is here. Little Ingrid wants to talk to you. He died? Are you stuck again? And with our money ... When will you be back, Uncle Salud? When...? Coming soon. Very soon. We're screwed. There must be way to make money around here. - With a shovel and pickaxe - I had an idea. - Shall we fly to Mr. Ears? - Best. We fly on our own. Yes. On a broom! I think there is no other equal model. It is a rarity. My grandfather came in it from North America. Your grandfather? - Where is it? - Over there. Right. It is not in the best condition, but you can see it if you want. You can pay me in installments if they can make it fly. - Without checking in? - Why? Do you have anything to give? I'm sorry to have asked. What do you think? What do I think? It will never fly. Never! Great. Done deal. Is there anything else missing? 2 pistons, the crankshaft, 40 m of canvas and 6 vertical beams. - Other than that, it's perfect. - Shut up and help me here. Hey, when are we going to eat? - When? - Eating is a luxury. Goodbye, handy! I will be back soon! Platform ... Is ready? Yes, let's try it out. You can. And then? - You bastard. What is it now? - Listen, Salud. And if we try ... You think you're stubborn, but you are not more stubborn than me. - Do you need help? - Is silent. - Do you want me to give you a hand? - No! This is a personal matter. No! Stop or I ... Plata! To! - Plata! - Go up to the tail. Fast! Hurry up! - You never learn. - We're still without him. Was it a personal matter? Its stubborn. I'm still winning. Come on, get on board. Do you see what I am? I see a bucket full of beer, Ramon! Hey, Ramon. What are you doing? No, no! Hey, Ramon. Wait by me. Wait! I want to... I want a beer. The bar has already closed. Open it again. Sorry turtle, you were late. They swallowed the bottles and everything. A conspiracy, that's what it is! - How much do you want for that? - Whereby? - Foam and ice. - How much does the foam cost? - On the house. - It's on the house. Are you leaving yet? Yes, but starting tomorrow there will be daily deliveries. - You mean I can place an order? - Only for the day after tomorrow. - And why the day after tomorrow? - Because tomorrow we are already booked. You can't do that to me. Look ... Whoever arrives first is served. It's fair. It's a conspiracy! Ok. Think of something you want. Just one and we'll try to bring it. - Only one thing is not easy. - It's not easy to land here. Now you spoke well! Just one thing? Ice cold! Years ago than not as one. Bring me two liters? Ice cream? Yes. If you bring me two liters of ice cream ... I'll give you this. - You can count on him. - Vanilla and chocolate, okay? It's ok... Vanilla and chocolate. - I warn you, if this is a joke ... - You're the one who's playful. - Do you have cigarettes? - Everything was sold. This is free. At least until the day after tomorrow. Put that thing away, okay? It makes me nervous. Do you have a fire? - Do you want even or odd? - For what? One of us has to stay. Otherwise, it won't take off. In addition, less weight, more merchandise. We take turns. One day I stay and in the other you. What do you choose? - What you lose remains? - Yes. I choose a pair. - Odd. - Two. It's pair. - Did not tell. - Why? I was not prepared. - Now, are you ready? - I am. Pair! - Three. It's odd. - You must be cheating. Cool dude. Say odd or even and I'm here to starve to death. See, if I were a jaguar you had no chance. You have to be careful in the realm of animals. You have nothing more to do night except to scare people? I saw that two arrived and one left. I thought you needed help. - Why? Did I scare you? - Do you call this help? You better get a scare than being eaten by a jaguar. It is not prudent to stay sitting there in the dark. Come on. I won't let you die on an empty stomach. Let's go. My hut is close by. You hadn't told me that yours was the cabin close by? I thought of making a detour to show you something. - What? - Do you see that mountain? - Which one? - The tallest. The middle one? Yes ... Doesn't it seem to talk to you? Do not. Halfway up the mountain, where the forest begins, there are 3 crosses. - And then? - I put them there. I thought you wanted share the view with me. I already have a madman watching my head! This is too much for me! Do you understand me? Yes. Furthermore still I haven't eaten all day. And instead of feeding me show me a mountain! I thought Plata I was crazy, but you ... - It's good. - Is good? I'm glad. Hey, look over there! Oh, it's Agnes. Poor thing, it doesn't bad for a fly, right, Agnes? - He's just suffering from the heat. - Suffering from the heat? Yes, but she's already gone. Get some air. Ready. It's done. Here. Smells good, doesn't it? It smells really good. Aren't you going to eat? - Before I have to take care of Arthur. - Arthur? From the dog. I had forgotten about him because of you. Will you forgive me Arthur? I'm sorry I made you wait, but we have a guest tonight. It's from the city. Here you are, Arthur. Don't do that. Your education? - To your health. - Good luck, good luck. I only drink it for medicinal reasons. Sure. Listen, old man, sorry for being angry with you before. When I'm hungry, I don't know why, but I'm in a bad mood. Leave it there. We are all a little strange here. You know ... There were three types that they dug up there. - Up there where? - There on the mountain. Ah, up there ... They were great friends. For years they shared everything. Even your women. Ah, even them! Yes, and one day we heard shooting coming up there. We ran to see what passed. And they were all dead. - All? - Yes. The others said "must have there was an argument between them. " Why did they kill each other? "We are going to bury them," I said. "Let us stay here for vultures, "they said. What a beautiful ritual. So... I decided to go it alone ... They just decided to dig the graves those poor bastards ... When they found out what it was about ... Oh God! You?ve never seen anything like it! It was not the normal stones that find. No! It was a deposit. A deposit. A big deposit. Immense! Huge! An entire mountain full of giant emeralds. Big as your fist. This was just the appetizer. Now comes the main course. No, no. Wait. Let me talk. Now you want to talk, but were you dumb before? But I thought you already knew. No. I just know that for weeks no one comes from Fossa Grande. They did contact with everyone ... Practice lower prices and sell on credit. Tell Margarita that if dinner again steak with banana, I choke it. No, today we switch. We have banana with steak. And come pick him up while he's hot or take nothing. Lucr?cia Borgia ... - Do you know who Lucr?cia Borgia was? - No. - Do you teach kids bad words? - Ol?. - Do you want more water? - No thank you. I feel good. - Come here, beautiful. - Just a moment. 19, ... 20, ... 21, ... 22, ... - The double is 48. 49, ... 50, ... - What are you doing? Doing our accounting. If we receive 20% of what we owe we flew out of this hole in a private jet. - Mademoiselle ... - Then, 21, ... 23, ... - S?, se?or. - I want the custom, ma cherie. One two three four... What are you murmuring? - The plane has already been paid. - That's not the problem. - And you got some change, didn't you? - I hope so. - Do we have any debts? - We needed nothing more. - So what's going on? - I can't tell. Shut up! Thank you darling. You are more beautiful than usual tonight. - Where do you think you are? - One of these days I'm getting married. You think you are in the middle of the jungle, isn't it? - Yes. - You're wrong. - Aren't we in a mud hole? - I'll show you where we are. - Mama Margarita ... - Yes? Can I have the honor? Behave yourself well, Plata. I have an army to feed. - Hey, that's worth 100 bucks. - It is true. Do you know where you are? Where? - Miguel! Miguel! - What is up? Do I need a pilot? - There are, but they don't fly at night. - Wake up one of them. I have a boy who is very hurt. Fast! We have to take him to the city. - Don't you see you're dying? - We didn't expect this, but we'll do our best. - In the air, ask for an ambulance. - It can not be. The airport is closed. - He's losing blood. - There's nothing to do. - It will stay on your conscience. - It's illegal and impossible. Don't you understand? If the boy is not already operated on, he dies before morning. Do you know if you could helped you, sir. Stay calm, boy. Everything will solve. Wait, beautiful. Do not. It's your turn to go tomorrow the Great Trench. Do you remember? Even or odd? - Currency in the air. Heads or tails? - Face. Am sorry. Crown came out. But you can do one thing. For once you can be the one do the math. Here's the bank. And may God help you if you lose it. Fast! Fast! Get him on board, quick. - Sir, I just wanted to thank ... - Yes Yes Yes... - Are you ready, boy? - Yes sir. I'll just drink a drip and we pull out. Sorry, but that boss of yours you don't know what you were talking about. We are not afraid to fly at night. We just know that it is impossible. I don't understand, sir. It's different with me. I don't even remember the last time I got drunk. I still do not understand. When I'm drunk, even very drunk, it is difficult to explain, but I become immortal. I call Italduma. Italduma, can you hear me? Pay off here. Who is the idiot who wants to take flight? Me. And I already took off. And if not be careful with the language, I'll take it off when I get there. - This is unlikely. - What? Rip out your tongue? No, get here. Maybe you want to know the weather report. Disturbances in the Cordillera Central. Zero visibility. Which means that we will never find. And even if you get here. Visibility is zero. I repeat, zero. And if by any chance you can land, you'll have a pair of handcuffs ? your waiting! And I will report you ... For flight code violation civil and insult to an officer. Angry. Now shut up and put some music on. - Music? - Do you have a preference? What song are you talking about? Whatever you want. Since not have to hear you. I don't think you realized that talk to the base commander! And you didn't understand that I am immortal. What are you? Forgets. Flame but it's a ambulance. I have a wounded on board. I hang up. - Are you really going to report him, sir? - Is silent. Zero visibility? It seems by day. These time bulletins ... Anyway, we won't have any problems if we don't lose sight of that road. - I don't hear anything, sir. - Me neither. So shut up. - Shut up! Are you ready, Santos? - Whenever you want, sir. - There they are! - Shoot 1, Santos. - Look that! There is a party in the city. - Fire, Santos. Hey, it's the airstrip! Yes. It's the airport. We?re here, muchacho. We are immortal! Immortals! - Have you ever been to Rio? - I even thought it was Ireland. - No, no, it was in Salvador. - Salvador is a beautiful city. - It's already gone. - Why didn't you go back there? I thought of going back there, but something has always stuck me here. - Such as? - I do not know. I do not remember. You wouldn't like to come back to Salvador? Dance a little? - I? To dance? - Wait... I don't like dancing. But I like walking on the beach ... But go back there for a walk? No way. Why? What's wrong with that? Before young people were on the beach and nobody bothered us. But never by car ... You point the car at the sea. Turn on the radio ... And you stay with the ocean Ahead and paradise behind. This one is new... By the sea with a car. Look who's here ... The smart kid in person! I see you changed weapons. Are you hunting for quails? Yes. Those who get fat and stupid with a cunning fly. - So you don't go to the dentist. - Go! Hands up! - Are you nervous? - Don't try that again. - Do you want another beer? - Oh yeah. Can be. Tell him to shut up! Easy, Arthur. We're just talking. I don't think he likes you very much. I told you to shut him up! Why don't you tell him that? - It's ok. I will tell you. - No! Augusto. Hello, Salud. How's the boy doing? - Get away. What are you doing here? - I came to check the plane. We were actually told to we leave the area for a few days. What about Plata? Did he leave too? - No. He's kind of crazy. - Yes. I already know that. To be continued. Last night he didn't even appeared at Mama Margarita. Must have slept in the old man's hut. I think so. Listen, I better get going. Take it easy! What's the hurry? - Who is that? - That's Mr. Ears. - Mr. Ears? - Yes... Come personally to collect the stones, once a month. From the miners. - What's in your ear? Are you deaf? - Like a door. - And who's the other guy? - Your personal pilot. - I've never seen him before. - Good. Once, I saw him crush a coconut in hand, just for fun. Like this. Like a banana. He never thinks of me ... - Maybe they sent him away. - No. He remembers and disappears. And he still takes the money, you know? And still take the money! You can take the money with him to the grave! But I can at least know where are we going? I have to go back... Just a minute. You said what was it with just one hand? See? It's nothing Special. We just got our hands dirty. It's the last time. Listen to what I tell you. Now it will be my way. - That damn idiot will see. - You have sense, but Plata ... - He's crazy. - Can you tell me where we're going? - Don't you know? - No. I'm going to buy some things in the city and then you take me right away. - Where? - For Fossa Grande, where would it be? - No, no ... I can't. - Angry! I knew I could count on you! - You're better, aren't you ...? - Little noise, old man. - Is anyone home? - Yes. Come in stupid. You are the stupid one. - Hello. - Hello. - Did you come by parachute? - Yes. And I fell into the only puddle there is. - Was it Augusto who brought you? - Yes. - Did you manage to steal everything? - Yes. Even the debt notes. What about the plane? - You shouldn't have done that. - Yes, but they did. - But you shouldn't have done it! - But they did. - Do you want to eat something? - With this face in front of me I feel sick. Bring him something to eat. - I did some shopping. - Oh yes? What did you bring me? Beautiful. - What else do you want? - Guess what. Check. Open the. I've done. It is empty. Mr. Ears ... Mr. Ears! He can only read his lips. - What are you doing here? - They're here ... they're here ... - Here what? - Here we. He said us! One more move and shoot. I thought that gun was discharged. Don't you know how to be silent? And it is as discharged as yours. Be careful, idiot. They're both loaded. You got us. And if we put are you in their place? You left the door open. - Did you close the back door? - Not a fly can get in. The weapons are already. There is no reason to keep this key here. Do not wait... Don't you happen to have a coin? They know that when everyone talks, you speak loudly and you get confused. Come on, come on. Hurry up. Is this the volume knob? Catch. Okay, here we go! Chi?a. Take this! Take this. Harder! - Get down, Salud. - Harder, boys. Force. Do you want a piece? Come on, guys! Let's do this! How beautiful. Want to give it to me to me? No? It is a pity. Good! Good! - Get me out of here. - Do you want to leave? You already left. Oh my! "Once, I saw him crush a coconut in your hand, like this. " "Like a banana." A banana. "With one hand, Salud. So. Like a banana. " Hey, what's up? Hi! Ready? Oh, fire, guys! - Plata. - Yes? - There are still guys out there. - Let them in. The key is out there. - They want to come in, don't they? - No, no! In there. You too. Check it out! Look! Is everything okay, Plata? Yes, there they go! Watch the beam! - Hey, Salud, are you okay? - Yes Yes. I'm glad the house it wasn't made of bricks! - Did they get the message? - Does that make any difference? They're a cool group, aren't they? Look ... They never thought to have so much water. Is to give them a bowl and they draw lots of water. Anyway, they have a good canoe and food, they lack nothing. And the fast ones waiting them below. - Quick? - Yes, the fast ones. - I saw a canoe down the river. - Did you see it? - They're not going to stop here, are they? - Yes, we are not miners. And if we don't take advantage this opportunity... Regarding the jet Mr. Ears' private business. You know. Because, since he preferred go by boat this time. Certainly ... that Salvador is very beautiful at this time of year. - We are going to Salvador. - Who said anything about Salvador? If you insist ... Of course we are going to Salvador. Salvador is awesome this time of year. I will prepare something for you to eat. They must be tired and hungry. Do you know something? I have a sister married in Salvador. They are not rich, but they have many children. The husband is a postman. They have a beautiful house and many rooms. The problem is that they both work. And they don't have who leave the children. If he likes animals, too you must like children, right? There, when a a kid jumps out of the drawer. - Hey, what's up? - You mean ... they take me with you? Sure. We are flying empty. There is a lot of space. But what about the dog? No problem. If he starts biting we bought a muzzle. Great. So you're coming with us. Was it a good idea to bring him? - You dreamed of this your whole life. - Dreaming is one thing ... You say that now. He's so crazy that everyone in town will like him. Can you imagine it in a big city? He'll be fine. And besides, it wasn't your idea say we were going to Salvador? And whose idea was it to do does he love your sister's children? - You don't even have a sister. - How do you know I don't have one? - Do you? - No. But I could have. Who knows what he expects meet. Go and talk to him. - And tell you what? - Anything. Keep him company. Are you crying? I am? Yes, I think I am. It is for being happy. I was wondering how things have changed over the years. And me in the middle of the jungle, away from it all. I was afraid of people. But not anymore. It will be cool ... Wonderful, you know? Wonderful. Wake up, old man. We are already on land. Platform ... What's it? Hey, he doesn't ... Yes ... The madman took flight. Is not fair. Poor madman. - It wasn't that crazy. - We know that. What we didn't know is that he he even found the mine. Look ... - It's beautiful, isn't it? - Yes but... The dog was not there very well. - Hey, isn't that the stone? - Yes. Take it easy. Sure. Apparently yours concession seems in order. But ministries approve documents very easily, isn't it? And leave all the work to we. We have to check, see and recheck. Before I give you permission, we have to analyze the situation in depth and check everything. It is seen that they are not from here. Of course, they don't know me. I take work very seriously! And apparently we have here a contradiction of stamps. This must be resolved immediately. I am a practical man and I speak clearly and openly. It's not like this? My proposal not only it is reasonable, as honest. It's not like this? Isn't that so, gentlemen? You agree to give it half of the concession as a proposal? What a stupid question! I mean ... 50% is more than enough for us. But sharing with someone like him ... In addition, the old man I wouldn't want that. - Nobody's gonna take anything from me, not me! - Bravo, you're on the right path. About what? About getting out of here. The sooner the better. You are kidding, you can only be kidding! We just have to get to the plane, and make them chase us for a while. - Good. And give up everything? - I did not say that. - Listen ... - No! Hear me, genius! Not a cannon is going to me get out of here! Do you understand? - Yes or no? - Yes. For once we have the law on our side with the documents in our hands. - That's right, they are no longer in our hands. - But of course they will return them. Sure... - A lawyer, if necessary ... - We hired a lawyer. 100 lawyers! Lawyers? I already found out a way to get out of here. I don't know if you noticed ... Just a minute... I also have an idea. - You? - Yes, me. Which is? It is! You don't leave here. That is my idea. - What are you ...? - Are you coming or not? - Get back inside! - I'll wait for you on the plane. Come back here, you son of a ... That bullshit ... I'll kill him! Hey, sorry. Excuse me. I did not see him. It will be fine. Don't go. I'll be right back. Don't close the cell. - He's in the car. - Let's go. I'll kill him! I swear I'll kill you! I'll break it in pieces. Rebellion, violence, flight. They're screwed. It is already more than enough, Your Excellency. Now for sure we are not going having trouble reaching an agreement. - Can I see those documents? - Certainly. - It's in the store. Surround him. - Let's go. - We have to catch him alive! - Good. A drink, your honor? Here it is. And a drink for me. - Well, a toast to our agreement. - Do you mind if I join? Great. Very well. Not bad. Yes. This document ends to all of our problems. Yes. I was thinking of the same thing. There are right moments to sleep, don't you think? - Oh no! - Oh yeah! My God, make me don't see him again. We were rich. A full tank ... We just needed a lawyer and he declared war on South America. It's the best. They give me 50 years if they catch me. Oh, are you? Finally they decided to send reinforcements! You bastard! You want to play, don't you? Then take it there! Platform ... Plata ... Plata! Plata! It was not intended! Plata! Platform ... You got scared, did you? You know, last night I didn't have time to tell you what I thought of your idea. - And then? - Then... So I said to myself, "Maybe he doesn't like me." "Maybe he is insulted?" You, insult me? No... Since you want to talk about it. We are not going to rush things. Yes. You are right, you know? Because there are certain matters that ... they can't be rushed. This was good. Very well. Hey, you better not go back chasing them? - For what? - To arrest them. - You can walk. - Don't you think they run? First of all, let's put some judgment in your head! Hey, Plata, do you think can we come back here one day? I have doubts, after all the trouble you've caused. - I? - Who else? Anyway no one You can take that concession from us. That's true. In other words, we are rich, but don't we have a cent? Yes. Like the old man.
