Mount up. Mount up. On 28th July 1879. C. Troop under command of Captain Cole. Was attacked by an Apache war party numbering approximately 70 braves. The enemy was driven off with heavy casualties. C. Troop also suffered over 50 percent casualties including Captain Cole. Of the survivors, two were wounded. Private Pendleton, who had a minor flesh wound to the left arm. And Lieutenant Cameron, severely wounded in the body. The only non-commissioned officer left alive was Sergeant Vinson. Who took command. After burying Captain Cole and the other dead. We proceeded westward at Sergeant Vinson's orders. To the best of my knowledge we were at that time .. In the south-western portion of the territory of New Mexico. Approximately one hundred miles from Fort Crain. Collins, I been thinking. Pretty stupid all this. Yeah? Well, you figure it. First we push west. The Apaches nail us. Then we head east. And they pick us off again. We're digging a groove in this desert six feet deep. He ain't marched us north or south yet. If we make it to Crain I'm dumping this monkey-suit, and I ain't just talking. Sure you are. A man don't mind so much getting it if it's for something worthwhile. Do you think meeting a wagon train to escort it to California is worthwhile? Not in my book. Think how big it must be. Needing an escort of three hundred men. I don't care if it stretches all the way back to St George. The wagon train. Who wants to die for a bunch of dirt farmers? Anyway, we ain't hit Crain yet. By the way things are going, maybe none of us ever will. We'll be lucky if we can find the main column. You know, Schwabacker. That was a big mess of Apaches we met with yesterday. So? - I've been thinking. Wouldn't it be a fine hoop-de-do if we was the main column? Well. I'll just be wetting my whistle if you don't mind, Lieutenant. I shouldn't have done that now. I should have more respect for government property. When a thing is useless .. You pin a medal on it and toot a horn and bury it in a deep hole. Of course, you have to have proper orders. Yes. Orders. The date. The regimental seal. Signed by 3 colonels, 2 generals and maybe the pope. Isn't that right, sir? You can't even spit without that. You can't even retreat when the whole platoon is being killed like mayflies. Not without orders. Captain Coombes. Captain Coombes. Captain Coombes, is it? There's no use calling him. He's resigned his commission, kind of. Kind of sudden like. - Captain Coombes. Yes, sir. On the double, sir. I'll try to dig him up for you. Of course, I may need a shovel. Sergeant. How about a ten-minute rest? - No. But there are wounded men. You mean you? Alright then, sentry. I know in your opinion this is only a scratch. We've been going for two solid hours. How much longer? We can't stop here. There's no cover. Although maybe you could hide behind us. Do you .. Do you think they're still following us? - I don't think. I am a sergeant. I do that I am taught like a trained dog. That is not funny, Sergeant. With the Lieutenant in his condition you are responsible for us. Then get back where you belong and quit whining. A few minutes rest. Is that too much to ask? Look. Do you want these stripes? You can have them. They weigh a ton. Apaches are all around here. I can smell them. They'll come when they're ready. When we least expect it. If we don't find that column soon. It will be at the waterhole, won't it? Travis and Pawnee have been out 6 hours. Maybe they never made the waterhole. Maybe when they got there, all they found was trouble. You shouldn't have sent out such a green man. I didn't hear you volunteer. - Why should I? I was wounded. The bullet only grazed you, Pendleton. It didn't even hurt your feelings. Maybe I should have gone ahead myself. Maybe they found more than a drink at that waterhole. How many you make it, Mr Travis? Too many. I don't mind admitting I'm getting awfully thirsty. Look at that one drink. He must have kidneys the size of big boulders. Man won't last long without water. Do not mention it. Sorry. I guess you're pretty thirsty too. - You mention again. Count Apaches. Notice all young. No squaw. No children. See sentry. This is war party. I don't see many rifles. Only five or six. You will learn. What's in man's heart, is more dangerous than what's in his hand. Come. We tell others, today we die in this canyon. Vinson. I thought I told you take care of him, McGurney. How do you like that? I did everything but hold his precious hand. Could I have the tobacco? As a keepsake, mind you. A terrible shock, I tell you. Him going in a jiffy like that. And without even asking permission from Washington. That will be enough of that. I need a 6-foot hole dug. Any volunteers? Don't look at me, Sergeant. I am too overcome with grief. I certainly can't do it. Alright. I'll be the dope. Have the tobacco. Collins. Three feet will be plenty. He was only half a man. Sergeant, look. Travis and Pawnee. About time. Apaches at the waterhole. More than fifty of them. They didn't have many rifles it that helps any. We only counted .. The Lieutenant? - Collins is burying him. Any sign of the column? No. No tracks. No nothing. Well. What do we do now, Sergeant? I don't know. If only the Lieutenant hadn't died. How do you like that, lads? The sergeant is lost without his lieutenant. We can't bypass that canyon. And if we could make it to the fort without water the horses can't. We can't just stay here. That's right. So there's nothing else to do but hit 'em. Hit 'em, is it? Are you mad, man? They outnumber us four to one. It must be the heat. Over fifty Apaches, he said. And you want us to take that waterhole? Bad. Very bad. You haven't said anything. - Maybe I haven't anything to say. No opinion? Not even here. Look, Vinson. Why don't we wait until we find the main column? Then we can attack in force. They only have a few guns and we all know that waterhole. If we deploy high on the cliffs we'll catch them in a pocket. That is suicide. He's crazy. Let's take a vote on it. - That's a democratic suggestion. And of the yays and the nays you can count one loud and enthusiastic 'nay'. Collins, that is deep enough. Put him in and cover him up. Let's move. You mean without reading the good book? If he needs our help to make it upstairs he's in worse shape than he looks. Myself, I'm one to always think well of a man but .. A fearful thought just crossed my mind. And I know just what it is. What's all this? - Never you mind. But if it's true, heaven help us all. There is much talk of heaven. A very fine place. But who asked us to go there? Get along with you. You low heathen. Mount up. Mount up. Alright. This is where we leave the horses. It's only a few miles to the canyon and it's vital they don't hear us coming. You mean that had to walk, stay here with the horses. See that they get water. - Water? What water? Are you crazy? What water are you referring to, Sergeant? What are you going to do? Tap a rock with your wand like Moses? Each man has water. Leave your canteens here. Yeah? And us? What are we supposed to do? Drink all you want at the waterhole. After we take it. If we take it. What happens if we don't take it? If we don't, we won't be thirsty. Alright. Now get this. Nobody fires a shot or makes a sound .. Until each man is in position with every exit to the canyon is covered. I'll make my way to the east end. When I get there I'll start shooting. You can think of all that nice water. I'm thinking of it now. And who well it would mix with whisky. You won't change your mind, Vinson? I'm sure the Lieutenant .. - The Lieutenant's dead. Move out. You are not a nervous man, Mr Travis. You no shoot me in battle. I'll do my best but what's all that? Indians believe it is wrong to kill. Paint face. Fool god. Pawnee. Just like I've always said. You're nothing but a low savage heel. Maybe. Explain to me. You, Christian. You carry gun. Get over behind that rock. That's their lookout up on that rock ahead. He's still a hundred miles away. - That's close enough for me. If we ever make it to Fort Crain, I'm dumping this monkey-suit for good. Sure you are. I want a man posted here. Pass the word back. Schwabacker. You stay with me. Collins. You and the others take cover over there. Travis. You and Pendleton stay here. Don't talk, and for the love of Mike don't smoke. Those savages have got noses as long as your arm. Look how many there are. - Never mind them. Can you handle your rifle with that bad arm? Yeah. I think so. Alright. Get going. And stay out of sight. That was close, man. Be more careful. Do you think I did it on purpose? - Alright. Don't get in an uproar. Come along, heathen. Let you and me try to find a rock that don't look like a tombstone. This is where you get off the train, Schwabacker. Thanks. It's almost wide open between here and the east end so cover me. Don't worry. They won't see you. You can hide behind your medals. He must think he's made of glass. - He's a fool. He's worse than a fool. He is a madman. That gets in my way. Travis. He's going to strike. - No. Don't move. You can't shoot. I've got to. Who fired that shot? He's gone and killed all of us. Who fired that first shot? - How do I know? Look at them come. The closer they come, the harder it is to miss. Keep shooting. They're coming up. They'll be paying us a call next. I tell you one thing. If I could remember a prayer I'd say it. No fear, my friend. I have already included you in mine. I think we got them. - Not yet. Keep shooting. They're on that ridge above us. Better pull back. Keep your position. - But they'll have us cold. Keep shooting. I told Vinson this would happen. I told him. He knows what he's doing. Hey. Hoo. I didn't know water could taste so good. I should write home about it but nobody in my clan would believe me. 'Water rots your insides', my pop used to say. 'It was the death of your uncle Tim'. What do they call it? Cirrhosis. Cirrhosis of the liver it causes. You alright, lad? Sure. A little green around the gills. I wouldn't be surprised. It did shake you, huh? Well, it's no disgrace after combat. What about during combat? I came within a hair of running. So that's it. I had to fight my legs more than the Indians. Well, never mind. We were all in the same fix. All except our .. Our ranking member. The Sergeant only knows how to attack. Him not man. Him animal. Four to one against us. We should have waited for the main column. Alright. Maybe I shouldn't say anything after what I did. Forget it. You couldn't help it. I'm a coward when it comes to snakes. - There are no such things as cowards. There is. There's only degrees of fright. Getting back to the Sergeant. I wonder if it is treason to .. To hate a butcher? Where is he anyhow? - Counting the dead. For a report. Maybe he'll get lucky and find some he can kill all over again. Travis. I'll be back in a minute. Right. You want me? I found a dead snake up on that ridge. I don't think you killed him. Did Pendleton? I don't know. Maybe it committed suicide. It's a mistake, you know. Not speaking up. In combat, one man breaking can mean lights out for everyone. Yes. What's that supposed to mean? Look, I'm a new man. As green as they come. I don't know brass buttons from hot rocks. Put me to work and order me around. But don't ask me questions like that. You never stick your neck out, do you Travis? I'm just something that comes with a horse. You've got brains. You could get somewhere. I like it where I am. Don't you ever have an opinion? Sure. I hate earthquakes. Pendleton was a good man when he came to this platoon but now he's had it. Was that all? He's dangerous. You can see by what happened today. Sixty percent casualties when it should have been a walkover. And you blame him? I made the only decision possible. What else could I do? Don't ask me. You must have been listening to McGurney. He thinks I enjoy all this. Do you? Not that it's any of my business. But why did you kill that last Apache? He was ready to surrender. You said it yourself, Travis. You don't know brass buttons from hot rocks. Those Apaches hate us, you understand? They hate us so much they've quit being human. Hate can do that. It swells up inside you until it pushes out every other feeling. Pain. Love. Even fear. When a man gets like that and is bursting with it .. The only way for that hate to come out is through a neat, round, bullet hole. That's all. You and the rest can take turns watching from that ridge up there. That's a mighty fine tune. Almost Irish. Lively, if you know what I mean. I don't feel very lively surrounded by all this cold meat. The dead don't bother me, lad. In fact, being among them and out of doors like this .. Reminds me of a wee sin I committed once. In a park outside Dublin. That night I learned that it is the living you've got to fear. A constable interrupted us in what you might call .. An awkward moment. I wonder what happened to the main column. Quiet, Pawnee. It's enough you're a low savage. Must you be a killjoy as well? They'll pass through here according to Vinson. Sooner or later we'll find out what happened to them. Today we killed 53 men. One whole war party. Maybe column not so lucky. Sergeant. McGurney, Pawnee. It came from the west end. It sounded like voices. Probably an echo of our own. Or likely coyotes. They can smell death for 40 miles. Hold it a minute. It may be the column, We won't take any chances. McGurney, go down. See that everyone takes cover. Men on foot. No horses. You're sure? How do you know? I can tell. I was borne of mother who was borne of desert. We got an uninvited guest. Come with me and look sharp. Just give me my rifle, Schwabacker, and go with the others. No. I might as well stay here. It's as good a place as any. Do you know what comes out of a green tree? Gooey sap. - That's me alright. Want to know something else? Do me a favor. Put a lid on that hole. When you get back to the fort. Don't you dump that monkey-suit. You wear it well. Hello. Hello! I got to stop. I can't help it. You go on ahead. Come on, Moss. I know this place. Sit up. We're almost there, I tell you. Just a few hundred yards more. - I can't make it. Alright. That's far enough. Hold it. Don't get trigger happy. We ain't moving. We are 2nd Platoon, B. Company. Is that you, Tucker? - Yeah. Give me a hand, McGurney. Moss is about dead. It's alright. It's the column. You mean, what's left of it. Alright. Get him on his feet. Go on. They came up at us from all sides. They cut us up like 5-cent's worth of liver. I've never seen anything like it. - You fellows were lucky making it here. I was with the colonel and even he was sweating. He must have sent out ten dispatches for help. He said he'd make it to this waterhole and try to hold out for reinforcements. Did any dispatch riders get through? Who knows? I was up on that little rise. Let me tell you I almost got seen. C. Company? Wiped them out down to the very last man. Riley, Wentworth. When the colonel got his, that was about it as far as I was concerned. There wasn't hardly nobody left. - What did you do, run? That's a stinking dirty word. We withdrew. - No without orders. Who said we had no orders? We had orders. From who? - From me. The ranking private. With everybody dead I ordered myself and Moss to beat it. Proper it is too, Sergeant. Congratulations on your first command, lad. You reached your objective without casualties. More than can be said for certain other parties. Slow down. We can do without that. We're in a tough enough spot. You're right. We must hold this place until help comes. The question is, can we? Even if dispatch got through. It takes troops five days to reach here. Long time. We got all the water we need. Some provisions and ammunition We can build a fort out of boulders. A good idea. - What you say, Vinson? No. You mean it's not possible? - I mean we're not staying. If it slipped your memory, our orders were to meet some wagons at Fort Crain. Nothing's changed to my knowledge. - Eleven of us? You must be out of your mind, Vinson. Those orders were meant for 300 men. Maybe no dispatch riders got through. That leaves us sitting here with every Apache in the world looking for us. No. We'll move at night and throw them by taking the long way south. If we don't pamper ourselves we'll be at the fort the day after tomorrow. South, is it? South of here is plain murder. You know it. What's the matter, Vinson? Haven't you spilled enough blood? I didn't hear that. - I'll repeat it for you. The area to the south has been closed to troops for more than a year. Why do you keep looking for trouble? - Are you all through? I'm not. You are a sick man, Vinson. And we all know why. Just because the Indians murdered your wife, you're not getting us all killed. We leave in ten minutes. It seems Tucker didn't come empty-handed. Like a belt? - No thanks. I hope what Pendleton said doesn't worry you. A lot of things worry me but not words. It's true, you know. I mean about my wife. What he and the rest probably don't know is there were also two kids. They were ambushed on the way to meet me. It will be five years in June. I'm sorry. I don't think they do know. She was quite a person. Not much on looks maybe, but .. Just about the gentlest human being I ever met. Could you believe it? She couldn't even swat a fly. She used to catch them in her hand and put them outside. Funny, her being married to somebody like me. Why not? I've swatted a few flies in my time. Anyway. I loved her. And I still do. Her name was Janet. The kids' names were .. Carol and John. Sometimes it's not good to remember. Let's get onto something else. Alright. Let's talk about you. You are a quite a mystery. Who, me? Nothing seems to really get to you. It's my nature. I guess I'm blank. Like those three little monkeys. You know: see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing. There is a typical Travis answer. You have told me exactly zero. What is there to tell? I'm thirty years old and a recruit. Before that I was twenty-nine years old and a common tramp. Before that? I was a baby. You trying to be funny? - No. I mean it. You see, I never could really make up my mind about anything. When I was a kid my folks asked me what I wanted to be. A doctor or a lawyer? I thought about it. But I just couldn't decide. So I put it off until college. Even then I could not make up my mind. So I graduated Cum Laude. Speaking fluent Greek. I hated leaving school. It seemed to demand some sort of a move on my part. What was it going to be? A doctor or a lawyer or .. Maybe open a bad restaurant. So I took to the road. To be alone and figure it out. I am still on the road. That in brief is the story of my life. Not quite. If you joined up, that must have required some kind of a decision. Yes. It did. Something was eating away at me. I wasn't a doctor or a lawyer. Maybe I wasn't even a man. I think I will find out. Here. More men find themselves in the wilderness than lose themselves in it. But in your case I don't see there is much hope. It doesn't take guts to go and shoot any Apaches who are trying to kill you. That's just protecting your own skin. Real guts involves the very thing you're afraid of. Decisions. Like my wife's. Your wife's? I told you the Apaches murdered her and the kids. That's not exactly true. She shot the children herself rather than have them taken alive. I can't match guts like that. Can you? Charlie. [ Indian language ] Two pelts. For knife. Two. Charlie. - Coming. Anything the matter, Adele? You got eyes. What are they doing here? I don't know. Maybe they're lost. Point them in the right direction. Get 'em moving. I'll handle his nibs. They got no right to be here but they keep coming. Every time they protect us I get my wagon burned. Who's that up ahead? Just a trader. You run into them once in a while. Way out here? They can't do much of a business. They don't have to. On every swap they make ten thousand percent. See it? A wagon. We must be near Crain. Can't see it. Too dizzy. Perk up. It's got eleven girls in it. One for each of us. You must be dizzier than me. We don't want no trouble here. Please go before it starts. [ Indian language ] Hello Charlie. How's business? So it's you. Excuse me if I don't jump for joy. Last time we met they burned me out. That's what you get for selling them matches. Dismount. Water your horses. Pitch your shelter over there. This is a closed area, Sergeant. You shouldn't be here. How is Adele? Charlie is married to the only Apache-speaking white woman in the area. Now just a minute. - Did I say something wrong? Don't think that Charlie and Adele are Indian-lovers. They're just business people. Dealing in flower, sugar, rifles and dead soldiers. Look, Sergeant. I know you don't like us. Look at it from our standpoint. If I had my way your standpoint would be up against the wall. It's a big country. Look, why not be a good fellow and camp someplace else? Who's the Pawnee? A customer. He'll be leaving in a minute. Name is Moving Cloud. Son of a chief. For my money there are all sons of chiefs. Where you going? I might have known it would be you. Does he understand English? - A little. Let him get on his pony and go. There's a mess of Apaches in this area. Over a thousand. If you start something you won't have a prayer. Tell him we stay until dark. Then push on to Fort Crain. He keeps us company until we get there. - What you talking about? You can't do that. He's done nothing. - That's just the way I want to keep it. Maybe if he's with us we won't have to crawl over more of his relatives. Tell him. Now tell him to put that knife down. You're making it rough. - Tell him. Better tell him again. Alright. Now, if you behave nothing will happen to you. This buck is our prisoner until we hit Fort Crain. Take charge of him. Come. Stay put. He's badly hurt. He's dead. You and your Sergeant started this. He was .. Only a red heathen but .. God alone knows, I loved that man. If no-one objects I'll be going to dig his grave. He brought us here where he knew there were Apaches. Why? Could it be .. And I'm asking you plain. Could it be he was prepared to sacrifice himself and the rest of us .. For a chance of more killing? Cut it out, McGurney. Yeah, cut it out. This outfit is beginning to scare me. You know what happened. His idea was to take a hostage so we'd get through to Crain without a fight. I wish I could believe it. The truth is he needled that buck by putting him in the custody of a Pawnee. He hasn't been the same since the word came about his wife. He lost control of the wagon. We ride it with him all the way to the bottom of the hill. Am I right or am I wrong? Don't ask me. I'm lost without my tea leaves. Moving Cloud really moves. I never got within a mile of him. Don't let it spoil your day. It does. It spoils yours too. Now we got to make a run for it before he gets back with his whole tribe. Where's the Pawnee? He is .. Here's another souvenir for you, Sergeant. This is a nice place Vinson has taken us to. Is this what he calls, running for it? We could be half way to Crain by now if we'd stuck to the trail. Five hours and where are we? I'm beginning to think McGurney's right. If he is. If you are right .. It's going to be real nice. We could have saved ourselves that long walk. By staying with the colonel. Schwabacker. - Yeah? Schwabacker. - Right here. What happens to a man when he dies? How do I know? They die. That's all. You mean it just goes blank? - Quit talking and save your strength. No. I got to know. - Why? Nothing like that will happen to you. You're too mean. You know what I think? I think it's like big rooms. You just keep walking from one room to the other. And you are all alone. All alone. Do you have to keep yapping about kicking off? If you lived for a hundred years. A thousand years. The walls keep tumbling down. You're good company alright. When we get to Crain the first thing I'm going to do is lose you. Just run. That's all. Empty rooms. Sergeant. How is he? He's still alive but it's no thanks to you. There's an abandoned cliff dwelling ahead. The well is dry and the walls are falling in. But we can get him in for a rest. You mean to stop? - Just for an hour. That's crazy. I'm against it. We'll never reach the fort at this rate. We'd never get there at that rate either. Alright. We'll build our own fort. Fort Massacre. He's coming around now. - Get him on his horse. And this time tie him. He's had an hour's rest. He'll be full of vinegar. Sergeant. You wearing the stripes so we are going to do like you say. But I give you fair warning this watchamacallit had better be abandoned. How long has that been there? Hundreds of years I guess. Probably nobody there but no use taking any chances. Dismount. Deploy. Vinson. Down. I'll get him for this. I swear I'll get him for it. What do you know? A menagerie. The question is, who does it belong to? Another question might be, which of these critters stinks the worst? Happy days. Happy days, is it? Where did a beggar like you learn English? Fort Crain bridge settlement. You got any whiskey? I'll give you whiskey, you old devil. With the flat of my hand. What's she got there? - A dog. And a darling beast it is. How old? It is not yet a dinner. You remain where you are. You understand? Why not? You got guns. Stay here and keep your eye on them. It's something I didn't expect. They're just settlement Piutes. No harm in them. Do as I say. Look, Sergeant. It must belong to those Piutes. Piutes? What Piutes? There's a couple camped here. Anything above? Not a thing. Tucker, you come with me. We'll hide the horses. You know, this is real luck. Looks like we got a little fresh milk. I knew I was saving this bottle for something swell. You mean, you touch that filthy animal? He's crawling with lice. Who ain't? Come on. Come on. Let's help bring Collins in. McGurney. Well. I must have dozed off. It's kind-of an eerie place. A lot of empty rooms and a well full of dust. What's this? Something that blew in for Halloween? This is just an old Piute with a terrible thirst. I seem to recall the Sergeant telling you to stay inside. My granddaughter. She is beautiful. And of good age. Did you notice? - That I have, you old rascal. If you scraped a bit of dirt off her she'd be a little princess. She will dance for whoever brings us a tin of horse salve. Any particular brand? Our donkey. Has sores on his back. Alright. I'll see what I can did up. But only if you get back inside. Put it right there. Clean the wound. But he's lost a lot of blood. It will be longer than an hour before he can travel again. It means we have to leave him here. - You'd like that, wouldn't you. No I wouldn't. Collins is a good man. It's good you got that arm in a sling. - That's enough of that. Collins is part of the platoon. As long as I'm in command no-one runs out on him. We'll stay here until tomorrow. He may be a little better by then. A little better or a little worse. That's what you really mean. It could go either way. We know tonight. - Why wait? If we ask him nice, maybe he'll kick off now. You talk too much. Get some water heated. You're the nurse. As for the rest of you, I want sentries and I want them awake. I'll take the first tour. - No. You turn in. I'm saving you for tonight. You two, get outside and keep your heads on swivels. Anybody want a shot? That sour milk? No. This is good fresh goat milk. Believe it or not it has quite a kick. Yeah? Let's see. It has a kick alright. You must have milked that donkey. I knew a gal once who was a health fiend. Drank nothing but goat's milk. And boy did she stink. What I wouldn't give for a good sleep. I brought the salve. Fine. Fine. Is that your granddaughter? Pretty, eh? And baptized. Want to see her papers? - No. I'll take your word for it. She's fine. Same as man, she can ride horse. Sing hymn. She drink whiskey. - She sounds like some girl. Wait. When she's through eating she will dance as we agreed. It will keep. Two tins. I only said she would dance. Grandpa, when you take your first bath. Don't skip your mind. You after me? - You've been out cold for ten hours. What? I took your shift. I couldn't sleep anyhow. But you'd better get ready now. You'll be needed in a few minutes at 4 o'clock. Sorry. You should have called me out. - Forget it. The wind has gone down. We should have a pretty nice day. How is Collins? - He's still with us. Just. I've been chewing away at it most of the night. It's wrong and sentimental. Bad arithmetic. Nine of us to only one of him. We'll wait until sunrise and then back in the saddle he goes. If he dies, he dies. Is it rough going from here? No. There's an old wagon trail. I figure about half a day to the fort. I'll sure be glad to see it. I've wondered if it even exists. It exists. My troubles won't be over when we get there. What do you mean? There will be charges filed. Maybe even a court martial. I told you I couldn't sleep. You know why? Too much noise. All these watches in my pocket ticking away. But you can't be blamed. - No? Who ordered the attack at the waterhole? Who refused to wait for reinforcements? Who put a Pawnee scout in charge of a hostile Apache? You think it looks good? - You did what seemed best. I don't know. Did I? I think so. At least I tried. I didn't want command. When it was wished on me .. I thought decisions through, stuck to the book, and kept myself out of it. You know what McGurney thinks, and the others. Forget it. They don't figure the orders came from a US army sergeant. They figure the orders came from a man whose wife was raped and murdered. You're just griping. Don't take them seriously, Vinson. When they get back to the fort it will all be forgotten in ten minutes. You think so? - I'm certain of it. As far as I am concerned .. I'm proud to be with you. Thanks for saying that. I need it. I need it bad. You may have made some mistakes. Honest mistakes that anyone could make. Like that business with the Pawnee. I put Pawnee in charge of that prisoner because he knew every Apache trick. That was no mistake. - Alright. If you're still mourning that unarmed buck I shot at the waterhole .. That was no mistake either. I tell you they're not to be trusted or shown any mercy. They're insane with hate. Bursting with it. Look. - Look nothing. You've gotta feed them bullets or .. End up one of these. You're all tied up in knots. Why not try to get some sleep? I'm sorry, Travis. And about those watches. Yeah? Any one of them could have been your own. You almost won yourself a trip to the happy hunting grounds. What are you doing up here sneaking around in the dark? My grandfather. Wants some whiskey. Who doesn't? He said soldiers always have some. But they don't always have girls to pass the time. Go back and tell him that mostly they don't have either. Who let you out of the cave? The Sergeant. So we can put some salve on the donkey. Why aren't you doing it? There is no whiskey. You're wasting your time. I have a lot of time. I am only seventeen. Where are you people headed? You mean, you don't know where you're going? Do you? Of course. It must frighten you. What do you mean? To know where you are going is to know where you will end. Look. It's too early in the morning. Piutes say that all journeys are without reason. You move from the place where you were born. To where you will die. Don't you agree? Let's forget the whole thing. You go and grease your donkey. He isn't mine. So, he belongs to your grandfather. Only in a way. Only in a ..? What do you mean by that? Here, he belongs to my grandfather. At Fort Crain, there would be some questions. So there is a reason for your journey. But let's not get into that again. Go and grease your donkey. Come on. You must get your strength up for this nice ride. I pulled every stinking detail on this stinking outfit but this is the limit. When we get to Crain I dump this monkey-suit for good. You said that your last two enlistments. - Yeah. But this time I mean it. Soldier. Soldier. What is it? What's all the excitement? Grandpa claims a party of horsemen is heading here. You can't prove it by me. I can't hear anything. Can you? My grandfather's ears are very sharp. If he says twenty or thirty horsemen will be here in an hour. They will come. I bet you one drink of whiskey. Maybe it's troopers from Crain. - From the closed area? We're overdue. Maybe a patrol looking for us. They'd never expect to find us here. It must be an Apache scouting party. One thing for sure. We can't stay here. What we waiting for, Vinson? - In an hour it will be daylight. There's no wind now so we'd leave nice fresh tracks. Let's get going. They'd catch up with us in no time. Have us cold right out in the open. You got us into this, Vinson. So you get us out. Easy, Pendleton. Let the man think. - 'Let him think', is it? That's all he's been doing. Vinson, I tell you one thing. If you get us in another scrap you'd keep out of the sights of my rifle. Listen. They can't know we're here. There is nothing. Not a mark to show we came in. So we'll play it looking down their throats. When they get here, all they'll find is those Piutes. Begging your pardon, Sergeant. What would you have us do? Disappear in a column of fours? I want everything out of sight. Men and equipment. 'Men and equipment' he says. Did you hear that, lads? Where do you think you're going? The wind. It has stopped. It is cool and the donkey wants to work. I can hardly hold him. Goodbye. Nobody's going anywhere. Get back inside. We are ready now. Many details. No fighting. Something wrong? - He says for us to stay. We can't let them go. They'll run to the Apaches and tell them we're hiding here. I don't think they will. After all, we've been good to them. You heard me. Get moving. If they find us here with you they will kill us. This trouble. Did we make it? We shoot no guns. Blow no bugles. My granddaughter, she is baptized. She has her papers. Why must we die? An Indian knows when an Indian is hated. The Sergeant's hate is for all to see. The only good Indian is a dead Indian. Baptized or not. That's what he thinks. Help us. He makes the decisions. There is nothing I can do. Welcome. [ Indian language ] What happened? They have taken my granddaughter. I don't like this. - If they harm her .. I will pull these stones down. Don't you do it. Yes. You will kill me. But they will kill you. Every one of you. Put that stone back. Enjoy your grave, soldier. Fort Crain. Did you steal these at the fort? They were here. Where did they go? - No! Don't. We have not seen them. All those things I stole at the fort. Please. Where did they go? Where did they go? Tell me quick. I would not deceive you. Maybe you tell truth. Are you crazy? Put those rocks back. They've killed my granddaughter. Do something. Cowards. - Put them back. Give me that rifle. They have murdered my granddaughter. Get back in there. Are you out of your mind? Are you wounded? Travis, are you hit bad? Well, I've still got my watch. He was a good animal. Sores on his back. I almost had them cured. - Never mind that. You know that way to Fort Crain. Take an Apache horse and ride there. Tell them we were cornered and attacked. We've got dead and wounded. Yes. And you killed them. They were going to go. My granddaughter told me. Why did you shoot? Are you going? You saw him do it. You saw him kill all these men. Well, Travis? Make up your mind. How do I know it's true? I wasn't even here. Just those three little monkeys. Alright. Get moving. I will go, but I will tell the truth. I am over eighty. But I am at least a man. And I will tell the truth. You heard the sergeant. Get going, grandpa. You killed him. Yes. For an Indian? - No. For a lot of Indians. For a lot of soldiers. That is the way he died. Sergeant Vinson was as fine a man as I ever knew. He fought to control the hate which had festered and grown within him. As hard as he could. But it finally overcame him. And it resulted in the near annihilation of C. Troop. That is the end of this action report. I realize now that is the only way. It could have ended. ..r-s..
