Now, Gwen, everything's fine. I'm just trying to keep it together. I. I know. I know. I should take the time to appreciate it all. I will. Someday. I'm getting another call. You ever feel like the day hasn't even begun yet and you're already late for everything? I know. Yeah. Bye bye. No. Piero Paliestra. Columbiano. Gracia. How do you feel? Refrigerator. Oh, no. Tango tiempo. What? Oh, I'm sorry. Annabelle. What? Come on. I'm coming. Move it or lose it. Put the pedals in the metal. Okay, let's go. Last call. All right. What are the refills to my label maker? Have you gone through those already? I paid $19.95 for those refills at a discount. Yeah, the dollar store, too. You've got to cut back on your labeling. I know, I know. All right, all right. They're on the top of the refrigerator. I'll help you get them. Just wait. I need to finish getting dressed. Hey, Amabelle, it's time to change the cat litter. It's Ben's turn. It's not my turn. I changed it last month. Do you want the refills? Then you're gonna change that litter until the cat dies. That's not fair. He's only two. Do you want the refills? Mom, do you want the refills? All right, where's my mask? Andrew's house. Hi, it's Bill. Is your mother there? Yes, and this is Annabelle, just in case you were wondering. Annabelle, I'm calling from a cellular phone. Congratulations. At? It'd be cheaper if you had friends and family, but then again, we're not friends or family. Who is it? It's Dorkhead. Annabelle, does the concept of matching mean anything to you? Mom, this white here matches with this right here. I'm matching. Hello? Phil, hi. How's the city? Famous. No more labeling. Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh huh. Uh uh. Uh. Uh huh. Great. Uh huh. Ben, why are you changing the cat litter again? Annabelle made me. It's delusional. Don't talk with your mouth full. Can I have some milk, please? Get your brother some milk, helpless. Bill, when do you get back? Yes, I contacted the vendors and they're expecting the solid red tops and the matching red bottoms tomorrow. So you better get here by tonight. Remember, tomorrow we've got that Ir's guy coming. Okay, good. We'll see you tonight. We all miss you, too. Bye. I thought you said no more smoking in the house. I'm trying to quit. Okay? Bill's in New York till tonight. He has a surprise for us. Can't wait. When are you gonna give Bill a break? When he stops acting like everything I say or do is totally stupid. Bill doesn't do that. Wanna bet? How come he has to call me Fender Bender all the time. Look, what really counts is that he likes you and I like him. You have to. You work with him. He's really been there for me, for us. It's your life. Mess it up any way you want. Then Annabelle and Jackie get swim practice after school so Clark's mother will pick you up. You're driving past a bus stop. Are we ever gonna have a normal morning? Maybe when dad moves back. They've been divorced for two years, you nerd. Aren't you ever gonna get it through your thick skull that he's not coming back? So I guess compassion and sensitivity aren't part of the vocabulary list yet. Nope. Too many syllables. Hey, pal. Now remember, you and Clark will wait until after swim practice, and then Zeno, I'll pick you guys up at the bus stop, okay? You told me a gajillion times, okay? Muah. You killed my lunch. It's not safe for you to be running around with this kind of cash. But that's my lunch money. Yo, Carrie, check it out, man. Got a brand new rap. When my kitty cat ran, I was all sat inside. The feeling is that I have, I can no longer have. You can't rap about a cat. Nobody raps about a cat, man. That's so weird. Yeah, I can. It's gonna be a hit. Village kids, Carrie speaking. How can I help you? Great. I need an item number, color. Inside. Oh, Herbie, be careful up there. Bill's stuck in the city till tonight. He's waiting on the rest of our order from the Orient. It's stuck in customs, so we're on our own today. There's no cappuccino on this morning. Sutnick called. He said if you want to make the payroll this week, and you do, because I need my check. He needs accounts payable for the last six months. He needs it like yesterday. Miguel said they couldn't find any cotton threads, so they went ahead and used polyester. On what? On everything. You're telling me the entire run of bike shorts was sewn with polyester thread? Don't shoot me. I'm only the messenger. And Joe, of course, left last night without shipping one order. Oh, wow. Where is he? He's sick. Again? Mm hmm. This is the third time this week. But tomorrow's Friday, and you're gonna fire him, right? Sure. Good. I'll fire. Well, if I can get him to show up, I'll fire him. He'll be in tomorrow. It's payday. The records. The records. I can do this. I can't do this. Herbie, Carrie, help. Shelley's appendix burst. You have to pick a replacement for the swim competition tomorrow. What? I'm 13 years old. You expect me to pick? You're the captain of the team, aren't you? You're the coach. What are we supposed to do? The swim meet is tomorrow. It's the semifinals. She's the best diver we've got. We have to beat Penn Foster with. The proper positive attitude. We will once you decide which alternate deserves to be brought up to the first team. I could make the call, but wouldn't we rather seize this opportunity? Your personal growth? No. Good luck with this, Andrews. I have faith you'll do the team proud. Obviously, you're gonna tell Tizer to bring up Elena. Yeah. Jackie's like nowhere. Her hair's waist stringing. She dresses like a four year old. She's an embarrassment. There's no choice here. None. Have you seen Jackie's high dives lately? Now's the perfect time to tell her you're picking Elena. Do it now and get it over. Good luck. Hey, Annabelle. Thanks for the history notes. See you tomorrow. Rachel and good are saying that you put Elena on the team. And I heard she already has a uniform. That's not true. Total rumor and speculation. I haven't made up my mind yet. Annabelle's got a boyfriend and his name is Lou. Shut up, Ben. Every time I look at him, it makes me puke. Shut up, Ben. But you would rather pick Elena. Jackie, listen, if you think that you're not completely ready, then I totally understand. No, I don't need more time. I know I can do it. I've been practicing really hard for this. You just don't have the guts to pick me. What's a talisman? It's a charm, stupid. Actually, a talisman's an object that's supposed to carry certain powers. I got it from a small guy in a weird little shop in a garment district. He says it came from Turkey. He thinks. How do you spell talisman, Ann? I got the matching one for Annabelle. Gee, thanks, Annabelle. They're wonderful. Don't eat off of other people's plates, Annabelle. Well, he's done, isn't he? Where's mine? Sorry. Fender bender. They only come in pairs. Fine. They're supposed to have something to do with thoughts or their powers or something. Does that mean that if I wish a certain person who shall remain nameless to go away, you will. Annabelle Joy. He says our thoughts are the most powerful things we have. So be careful what you think. I guess Ben doesn't have to worry because he never thinks. Hey, what do you mean? Duh. Annabelle, thank you. I love it. Yeah, thanks. Look, you asked my advice and I gave it. I just think you're mad because I'm not giving you the answer you want to hear. I could lose my friends. I could lose the meat. Funny. I wouldn't worry a lot about it. What's this I hear about you and Luke? Nothing. We're just friends. Or is that a crime now, too? I don't trust him. You don't know him. Exactly. That's my point. And besides, you're too young to start getting involved with boys. I'm too young to get involved with boys. I'm too young to have my own phone. I'm too young to take the bus. You're not too young to take the bus. I just don't like you taking the bus. According to you, I'm too young to live. Sweetheart, what I wouldn't give to be too young. You don't understand anything. I understand that if I don't get these sketches done, I could lose the biggest potential customer village kids ever had. I hate my life. You don't know what it's like. You just don't get it. Yeah? Well, sometime you ought to try mine. Why can't you pick him up? All I'm asking you to do is walk over to the primary school, get your brother, and bring him to the swim meet. I'll get there as soon as I possibly can. Why don't you write yourself a note so you don't forget? And what happens when he goes into his weirdo raft routine and totally distracts me? Throw him some raw meat. Horrible, terrible things are gonna happen today. Cause it's Friday the 13th. No, they're not. Everybody knows that Friday the 13th is good luck, stupid. Who says everybody knows? I don't think so. You know the talisman that bill gave you? Maybe you should wear that today, honey. You know, it might bring you good luck for the swim meet. Come here, Zach. Leave the cat alone. This label could save his life. Hey, builder, we're late. You ready? I know. I'm almost ready. So, had breakfast without Al Spitz this morning? Oh, that's right. Did you get the order? Not quite, but it looks promising. I don't know what we're gonna do if we don't have a strong quarter. We're gonna go out of business. Think positive. Just sell Debbie today. Everything will be fine. Yeah. Yeah, mister. Everything's gonna be okay. Do you have any cash? No. Use your credit card. Don't worry. You're definitely, absolutely charmed by you. By your beauty, your wit, your charisma. Els wanted to stop this craziness and move in together. Gee, I don't know. I had this image once. It was. It was you, Bill. And you were on your knees and you had a bottle of champagne. And I think it was a ring. Yes, it was. It was a ring and a nice little love it box. How about dinner instead? Annabelle, nap. I'm leaving. Did you wash your baking cubes? Don't forget to take a jacket. And turn that music off. Do you know that today is Friday the 13th? Why did you schedule my meeting for Friday the 13th? Oh, tell me you're superstitious now. Well, aren't you? You're the one that got us these talismans. Annabelle, come on. Get going. Clarkell's already here. It'd be nice to be growing up and order people around all day. Sure. It'd be nice to have someone who makes sure my life runs on schedule. Mom doesn't know what a piece of cake her life is. Annabelle doesn't know how easy she's got it. Forget it. I'm not wearing these. This? It'd be nice to have her life. Honey, I'm feeling a little claustrophobic. Could you move over? Who you calling, honey? Where's mom? Mom? If I'm her, then she must be me. Hey, watch it. Here are my sunglasses. $0.75. What happened to her? Alanna? Hey, Annabelle. Isn't it sad that Elena thinks Michael r likes her just because he told Ashley he loves Chloe and only wants to have Elena over to get some advice? Maybe you should tell Elena. He doesn't really like her. He just wants to be friends. I know. He's not interested in. They should get to know. It will be. Pinch me. Ow. This must be a dream. It can't be happening. It's really happening. I don't know how it's happening, but it is happening. Annabelle's body. How can I be in Annabelle's body? I don't get it. I just don't get it. What is this place, a zoo? Where are all the teachers? I feel like I'm walking through mud. These shoes must weigh 75 pounds apiece. What do they think they're doing? Stop that. Goodbye, Andrew. This is crazy. Why am I not me? I think like me, but I sound like mom and I look like mom. Ugh, this hairspray feels terrible. Did I do something to upset you? Yeah. Door kid like be born. Do you ever stop to think that maybe not everything's about you? Okay, point. Well, take him. Listen, Herbie's gonna take you later to pick up your car so you can drive. Drive? I can't drive. What are you talking about? Uh, my. My license expired. I can't drive until I renew it. Okay, fine. And Herbie can drop you off at the restaurant. What do you mean drop off? Where are you gonna be? With Zutnik, remember? Our accountant. And you've got to get ready for that meeting with Frida Debney. Frida who? Frieda who? That's funny, Ellen Frieda Debney, head buyer for all 4420 kc department stores. The woman holds the future of our company in the palm of her hands. Hello? That big important meeting that mom was talking about is today. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. I can't go to that lunch. Look, I gotta tell you something. Now, you may not believe it cause I don't believe it, but you gotta listen. Darling, calm down. What, you nuts? It was for good luck. How do you get out of this car? Don't touch me. I was reaching for the handle. What is the matter with you? Everything. Look, I know you're nervous. Take a deep breath, calm down. Everything's gonna be fine. Just be yourself. Fat chance. Don't forget your portfolio and tell her of you to pick up these boxes. Hey, Annabelle, how you doing? Don't you want to trade? Trade what? Clothes. Why on earth would I want to trade clothes with you? Annabelle, we do it every day. Yellow is not my color. Heather, can you give me a ride after school today? I'm gonna have to ask my mom because, you know, we're gonna go pick up my brother, and they're both. What's his problem? See you in class, Annabelle. Hey, Annabelle, don't forget it's six period, Cobb's hill. Who are you? Luke. Luke. Luke Mathis. When did you get so cute? Give me a break. Todos. Todos to man. Sus asiento, orita. Everyone take your seats, por favor. Please. Dinky. Dinky Shapiro. Oh, my God. Oh, I didn't know you were a teacher. Here to spend 2025 years. No one's called me Dinky since the fifth grade, Annabelle. How'd you know my maiden name? Just a lucky guess, I guess. Listen, Dinky. Oh, Dinky, I need your help. You don't understand this twilight zone kind of. Ugh. Pay attention, everybody. We're having a pop oral quiz. To your seat. Rachel just wants Elena on the team to make herself look better. And it's so unfair how she goes around trashing Jackie. Rachel just uses people. Tell me, girls, why is Rachel so popular? Stop chewing her the truth. Because if you're not nice to her, she'll destroy you. Now, class, the first question is, how do you introduce yourself to someone you've just met for the first time? Animal, get your head down. Hola. Me amo Annabel Andrews. Mucho gusto. Coneselle que elegante pareses conosas un lugar bueno para comer, Annabelle. Village kids. Carrie. Can I help you? Hey. Hey, Yellen. Yeah, Miguel said they got the fabric for the warm ups. It's all screwed up. You need to go make a decision. I'll tell mom. Why? Why? What's your mom have to do with the warm up suits? Uh, Miguel's here. You can talk to him right now. Why don't you talk to him? I don't speak Spanish. Man, I am funking Spanish. What are you talking about? See, something happened. I turned into my mother. Well, I'm. I'm me, but I'm in my mother's body, so I guess she's her and mine. You get her? Yeah. So can you help me? With what? Buenos dias. Buenos dias. Mucho gusto. Thank you. Fridos, manana. Siesta. See? See? No. Kiriskia. Gargote. Primero. Mira la senor. No. Mira. No. See? Como esta? Muy ving. Gracias. Mira, la esposa. No, Gabriel. See? Taquitos and guacamole. Gracias. Adios. Hi, Carrie. Look, this is a bit of an emergency. I need to speak to Annabelle. I mean, my mother, right now. Is she there? Not at the moment, honey, has she. Been in at all today? Just for a minute. It's been one crisis here after another crisis. What kind of crisis? First there was something with the buttons, then there's a problem with the fabric. I don't know how these people do business. She can't handle all that. Look, Carrie, I'm gonna tell you something, and you have to believe me. Don't ask me any questions because I won't be able to answer them. Go ahead. Wendy, I need to talk to you. Annabelle, you're gonna have to catch me later because I gotta get off and grab these lines. Okay, well, just tell Ellen that to hang in there and I know what's going on and I'll get back to her as soon as I can. I don't mean to please put you on the spot or anything, Annabelle, but I at least think I deserve a straight answer. Are you picking me or Laina? I'm gonna do what should have been done right from the start. You're it. I'm choosing you. Really? Honestly. You've worked hard for it, Jackie. You deserve it. Oh, Annabelle, thank you. But aren't you worried about what Rachel's gonna say? Listen, I have dealt with people more formidable than Rachel French practically every day of my life. Just go out there and worry about doing your best. Thank you, Annabelle. You're really great. I will let you down. I know. Dear Annabelle, science is this way. We're dissecting frogs today, remember? Oh, that's inhumane. Not least of all disgusting. Didn't the board of education vote against that? Next up is the esophagus, located here. It is part of the alimentary canal that begins at the inferior end of the laryngo pharynx and passes between the trachea. I am the frog, the trachea and the vertebral column until it penetrates the diaphragm. Do you want to take out the esophagus or should I? Wait, let's consider this a minute. Why should anybody have to do it? Is there a problem, Miss Andrews? Actually, yes. The more I think about it, the more I realize that this is an incredibly antiquated and sadistic, not to mention sickening ritual that doesn't really teach anything that couldn't be learned by plastic models and charts. Right on. The only reason it goes on year after year is because everybody thinks it's revolting. But they figure if they have to suffer through it, the next generation should, too. This is not revolting. It's education. No one ever said education was pretty education. Excuse me, but isn't the frog an endangered species? Hold on a minute there, young lady. Who do you think you are? I am the woman who stood on the steps of the student union at Penn State in 1969 and marched for equality for our sisters. We fought for the era. We demanded world peace. We insisted that all people have equal rights under the constitution of the United States of America. Detention. No, I can't possibly fit detention in today. Well, maybe you should have thought about that before you disrupted your entire class. Would you like a martini with it? Oh, that would be wonderful. Thank you. Dry, two olives I've noticed that some of your team's uniforms and equipment need updating. Well, of course they do. And just as soon as the good little man with lots of money shows up, we'll get him. Now, the child. Principal handel, please don't treat me like I am one. Oh, excuse me. Let me put it another way. Where are the funds? Now, about this detention of yours. What I want to see you do. Let's negotiate. Let's what? Negotiate what? I'd like to propose. Oh, don't you think that you're going to weasel out of your detention? Miss andrews, I've been doing this for too long and I've seen too many kids smarter than you. Yes, but none with my experience. Now let's say that my company designs the uniforms. Your company? My mother's company. Uh huh. We'll give them to you at a cost. And we can throw a bingo night or something to raise the necessary funds. What do you think? I think you've got 2 hours detention for that little prank of yours, Miss Andrew. 1 hour for the cigarette and two more hours for the little stump that you just pulled bribing the principal. You are dismissed. Well, I'm sorry to hear that, principal handle. I thought the children would be very happy with new uniforms. Out. Oh, mom. I want it my own heart. Carrie, there's something really freaky happening here. Who you're seeing isn't me. See, who you're seeing is my mom. Only it's just me kinda in my mom's skin. Sweetie, it's Friday the 13th. Everybody's gonna jump out of their skin once in a while. It'll pass. Joe's here. He wants his paycheck. Yeah. No. Yeah. You have to fire him today. Now. I'll fire him tomorrow. Tomorrow's Saturday, sweetie. He's costing us money. You have to fire him now. I'm sending him in. I'm turning off that music. I don't know how you can think with it on. What's up? Hi Joe. I. You want some chocolate? Yeah, thanks. So, Joe, what exactly is it that you do here? I drive, I pick up, I deliver, I box, I deal with the customers, I do everything. Somebody sure met at you. Hey, if you're talking about me not. Coming in all week, I got a good excuse. My relatives come in from Philly. They expect a big show. You know, my wife, she gets the flu. My mother comes in from New York. To see the relatives. And then my mother goes to the hospital with pneumonia. So suddenly I'm left with little Sophia. And I'm supposed to be the nurse. I only got two hands. You know what I'm saying? I'm really sorry, Joe. It sounds terrible. But I got good news for you. You're fired so you can spend more time with your family. I gotta get out of here. Oh, could I trouble you for a cigarette? No problem. Great. Do you have a light? Thanks. Don't you girls think you're a little young to be smoking? I'm trying to quit. Annabelle, what are you doing? Are you crazy or something? Stop it. Give that back. You hate cigarettes. I do. I I do. I do. Honey. I'm not honey. What do I look like I come from a bee? I'm Annabelle. Why do you call people honey? It's so stupid. Else. What's the matter? What's wrong? I've been trying to tell you what's wrong. I'm trapped in this body that isn't mine. You look great to me, but if you don't like your body, maybe want to try cutting down that sugar? I think it's giving you mood swings. Pattern makers here. Good. She needs to see the mannequin drink. Good. I knew that. I'm turning off that music. I don't know how you can think with it on. Els, what are you doing? Designing a new line for twins. Siamese twins. Is this one of the sketches you made for Frida Debney? Ells, I don't know what she's on, but whatever it is, I want some. Ellen, whatever happened to your irrational fear of hypes? No problem. Whoa. Cool job, boss. Thanks. Carmen just called. She said she cannot finish the summer samples because she never got the labels. We're supposed to be showing them to her in an hour. The label maker called and said he won't release anything because he never got a check from us. Ellen, what was the last thing I said to you before we left last night? Can I have a hand? I put a check on your desk and I told you to have Herbie deliver it first thing this morning so he could take the labels to Bernice himself. You could have called him. And what were you planning to show Frida Debney? Well, can't you just let her see some of the junk we have around here? Ellen, this is Winter merchandise. Would it do any good to show a buyer samples of things that she's never gonna buy? No. What is wrong with you? Why do you keep yelling at me? Well, pull yourself together. We have a meeting in an hour and you're a mess. Comb your hair fix yourself up. Do what you always do. I don't understand what's gotten into you today. Well, you're not the only one. Believe me. I woke up and I was me. And now I'm not. What happened? I did have some highlights put in my hair the other day. Maybe something in the chemicals? Nah, that's impossible. The necklace. The talisman. Annabelle and I each got one from Bill. Could the talisman have something to do with it? Increases the power of your thoughts? Oh, my God. You got a hall pass, Miss Andrews? Your flies open, mister sweet. Out. Excuse me. And where are we going? Well, miss. Miss Delia. What do you got amnesia? Well, you see, I left my bag in Miss Barab's class, so could I go get it now? Just be back before class starts. Okay? Okay. I think it's Sanskrit. Maybe it's Turkish. Well, it is oriental. You know what? It could be? It could be ancient Chinese. Maybe it's japanese. Or maybe it's asian. What's that? Oh, it's an old dialect. It's a cross between indian and asian. It's. I'm not sure. Maybe it's Tibetan. Isn't there a book that can help me decipher this? I'm afraid that our library does not have a Sanskrit English dictionary. We pretty much stop at Webster here. Maybe you should just go straight to the source. Great. Where's that? The Himalayas. If you need help, there is a woman that can help you. Her name is Leanne Futterman, and ancient languages are her passion. What country is she in? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You go to the restaurant to meet Rita. Herb, you'll take me to pick up the samples without the label. I'll meet you at the restaurant as soon as I can. What do I do until you get there? Just be the woman you were yesterday. Plastic. How do they feel? Fine. I'm gonna wear them out of here. Oh, man, I gotta be across town in, like, 15 minutes. I'll just put your shoes in a bag for you, man. Cool. How long have you been rolling? Since I was five. Well, listen, throw in one of those helmets, and, um, I need elbow pads and knee pads. Knee pads? Oh, mom's not gonna like it if her knees get all scraped up. Aw, don't scam me, man. You got the RKZ 60s already. You better throw in a pair of those. Uh, size eight and a half. Uh, no, five and a half narrow for you. Yeah, no, um, for my kid's sister. Oh, she'll love them. I just bought a pair of those myself, they fly. Anything else? Well, I guess I need something to carry all this in, right? Absolutely. Whoa. Okay, body, believe me, we can do this. What if I thought up skirts? They're useless. How are you supposed to move? Oh, I see. All right, I got it. But they're still stupid. I love your dirty fingernails. And I love the way you always smell of her maldives. I love your dry, brittle hair. I love your chubby. Annabelle. I'm looking for Miss Spiderman. She's not here, Dinky. You always did go for a younger man. You don't belong in here, young lady. Out. Come with me, Annabelle. Andrews, what's wrong with you? Get out here, Andrews. Um, well, I'm extremely tired and I thought that perhaps I could sit this one out if that's okay. Let's go, Andrews. Hey, y'all ready. Annabelle? Okay, let's go. Hands up. Hands up. Defense. Defense. Traveling. Where are you going? You're basking that way. Give me the ball. Okay, let's go. Bring it in, bring it in. Hand. Jump. Hand up. Pass, Pat. Shoot. Annabelle. Pass. Passenger double dribble. Andrews, give me the ball. Why? Andrews, don't you give me attitude. Okay, inbound. Hey, hey, hey. Andrews, what are you doing now? What is it? Give me the ball. No, I finally got the ball. Why should I give it to you? Technical. Don't get so angry. It's just a game, you know. Shoot, shoot, shoot. Get out. More. Grab it. Okay, everybody down for it. Hustle. Hustle back. I don't have all day happen up. Andrews? Yes, this is the restaurant. How did you get this number? Have misses Andrews and Mister Davidson arrived? No, Miss Devon. Well, have they called? Did they send a messenger? Have they faxed? Not that I know of, Miss Debney. I hope they have a good excuse. Lose the music. This is definitely chinese. Boy, my eyes are not what they used to be. I've been meaning to get glasses, but I. You gotta clear something up for me. Okay? I've been having a really bad day and I was just in the library and I swear that I saw someone that looked exactly like me. Right, right. So she's your twin, right? You guys are twin? No, because twins share an egg and we each have our own egg. Now, I think what this means. I'm not sure what this means. I think it means that you guys are twins. Okay, you win. Now this is the symbol for. Well, let's take a look at what's going on down here because I definitely recognize this. Great. But I can. I can't actually make sense of it. What about those little characters down there? Hmm? Hmm. What? Something. Something. Permanent. Permanent. Uh, may I help you, ma'am? Yeah, um, where's Frida? Miss Debney? She's over there, but I have to check your skates. Trick em. For what? You have to take your skates off. No way. I just got em. I can't believe I made it. Who are you? Annabelle Andrews. I'm supposed to be meeting an Ellen Andrews. I mean Ellen. Thanks. Thanks. Misses Ellen Andrews? That's me. That's right. I'm sorry I'm late. Fine. The meter's running. Let's just get going. Now. What about door kids? Well, you are the designer and co owner of village kids, are you not? Uh uh. Kinda. Well, let's see some samples. Oh, see, there's this whole screw up with the samples. So dork Bill had to go get the samples, but he's. He's probably gonna be here any minute. Well, let's see some sketches, the renderings, your portfolio. I'm gonna be back in 2 seconds. Promise. Thanks guys. Yeah, yeah. 2 seconds. Two secs. I don't understand what could have happened to her. How did you enjoy the resort? Stop changing the subject, okay? I'm out of time. Why don't you just show me samples? Well. Please don't. I know. Look, Frida, Ellen can answer all your questions. I'm just the boring numbers guy. Ellen's a creative genius, as I've heard you are. Well, actually, I'm a little of both. Really? I suppose we could take a few minutes to talk about me. You know, when I got started in this business, I was wet behind the ears. I was a green kid. Sorry, Bill. It's not about you. It's just that, you know, I wouldn't wait for my own mother this long. And after years of analysis, I almost like her. Yo, Frida, check it out, man. I got everything. I'm really sorry it took so long, but I found the sketches. It's terrific. Could you please let go of my arm? Sorry, I didn't want you going any place. Would you care for anything to drink? Oh, yeah, yeah. Um, can we have a root beer float? What am I asking you for? I'd like a root beer float. A root beer float? Yeah. Double scoops of ice cream, burger with the works. French fries. Oh, and some of those french fried onion rings. Yeah, we gotta have those for her. Hey, I'm paying. Can I please go to the bathroom? Sure. She's where? With Frida Debney at the restaurant. Hi, Stan. Horner Ir's. I'm here to see Bill Davidson. I gotta run. The guy from the IR's is here. Don't worry about anything. Your mom's gonna be fine. Shoot me. Don't you love these onion rings? She must be hungry. Ellen, Miss Debney's been waiting patiently, impatiently, for you to explain your vision of this unique and matched line of children's clothing. Cool. Misses Andrews, as charming as this has been, I really. I do have to get back to my office. Well, wait. She worked. I worked really hard on these. Can't you just stay and take a look at them? Can I speak to you a moment? Sure. Alone. Excuse us, Frida. Oh, can't I eat first? You need to have some of my french fries. Well, don't put too much ketchup on them, though. Could you take those skates off? They're not skates. They're rollerblades. What has gotten into you? Get a hold of yourself. Leather sale. We could lose everything. You could lose a house. Ben won't get his braces. Annabelle won't go to summer camp. What? Show her the sketches, sell her the line. Get the order. Oh, put a little pressure on me, why don't you? I have to go meet that ir's guy. I'll see you later. Take a chill pill. So I guess you want me to show you our stuff, huh? Whatever gave you that idea? Did anybody ride a bike today? A bike? Ride a bike? No. Did anybody ride a bike today? Did anybody ride a bike today? I missed the bus. Why? Oh, great. Can I borrow it? Sure. Come on. I'll show you how to unlock it. Go this way. Just make sure you're back by 6th period for Cobb's Hill. Cobb's Hill? Isn't that where teenagers go and make out, do other things? Yeah. So please don't tell me it's already come to this. That's pretty funny, Annabelle. You sound just like my mother. Tell me, Luke, have we ever. Ben took Cobb's Hill? No. So why start now? This is my bike. The combination? 721.7. And don't forget to lock it. Thanks, Luke. Wait. Don't you want the helmet? No, thanks. I'm already having a bad day. The last thing I need is helmet hair. I'm not gonna lie to a nice lady like you. I can't answer all your questions because I don't know all the answers. But I'll tell you what I do know. Kids really like this stuff. It's comfortable. It feels good. It looks good. You know, there's a secret that most parents don't know. I'm gonna tell you. One of the reasons it's catching on is because, Miss Debney, do you have kids? I don't really understand children. Okay, so you probably don't know this. Girls are always trading clothes with each other constantly, like at school and junk. So free. And Debbie's tips always suck. You want to know why they always suck? Because of you. Because you don't know how to do your work. You are the reason. Everybody knows that Rita Debney's the worst. I mean, that kid. Yeah, maybe she'd give us a nickel. More combo wear or trade or trade back. And no matter what, it always looks great. My friends love it, and it's price fair, too, so the parents like it too. Look, all my talking in the world isn't gonna prove it to you. Like, if you saw the kids in their clothes, would you do that for me? Would you come to school with me for an hour to see the clothes on the kids? You're not kidding. Oh, please. Pretty please. Today? In a few hours, for an hour. Well, I have to admit, your youthful enthusiasm is, you know, rather appealing. I'll let you know when. I'll either be there or I won't. You make me feel so young. You make me feel like spring has sprung. And every time I see your grin, I'm such a happy individual. The moment that you speak, I want to go play hide and seek. I wanna go and bounce the moon just like a toy balloon. You and I are just like a couple of tights running a pride. It's great having legs with only twelve years old. So forget me nuts. These always smell this good. You make me feel they're a song. Oh, Master Lee, your peking duck is the best in town. It's the only one in town who. Wouldn'T happen to have any of your wabu beef and cherry plum sauce ready yet, would you? I miss lunch. Joe, throw a few of those duck. Feet in the fry of your peaches. Time. Joe. Hey, Annabelle. Joe, what are you doing here? Your mother fired me this morning. I came in here for lunch, arrested. His history. Fascinating. Simply fascinating. Where did you say you got this? My boyfriend brought it from New York. So young to have a boyfriend. Where in New York? He bought it off a man in the garment district. Ah, must have been sun li. He has a little shop of 28th and 7th. Great. So you can help me. No. No? What do you mean, no? You said you could read Chinese. No, he does. Heehoo. Hee ho hee ho. Who he? Heeho li. My grandfather. Oh, forget it. He's sleeping. So wake him up. Oh, no. You can never wake up. Hee holy. He can only wake up naturally. He's awake now. Grandfather, tell us what this means. Mind is everything. If you cling to thought with Will, it assumes outward form. Outward form? Yeah. When you employ your will, you control your own destiny. Is that it? Sunset. Most auspicious time for movement in firmament. Or change will be permanent. Sunset. What time is it? What are you doing here, misses Andrews? Don't ask. Have you seen Annabelle? No. She should be here. I don't know where she is. Listen, Jackie, I'm sorry to take you out of class, but it's really important. I've been doing a lot of thinking and, well, I don't care what Rachel and Brin say. I say you're the one that should be in the meet today. That's what Annabelle said, too. She did? When? First thing this morning. I should have figured she'd do that. I didn't know you knew how to rollerblade. Misses a. Yeah, well, Jackie, you have to do me this huge favor. I want you and the other guys to wear these warm ups today and sell your sweats. I got this big deal lady coming today and it's totally crucial for her to see us in our outfits. Okay? Only one problem. Misses a. Didn't you hear? Right now, Annabelle and I are the team. What? Rachel, Elena and Bryn quit? Yeah, all because of me. Nice, huh? So you probably better keep your clothes because right now all you can do is stand up in front of the whole school and forfeit. For the third time. Annabelle, no, I have not seen your mother, nor do I believe a word you're saying. Bill, it's fact. I don't exactly know how, and I don't know why I'm telling you this, but I'm Ellen, trapped in Annabelle's body. Yeah, and I am Superman trapped in Clark Kent's body. Will you look at him? What does he think he's doing? Hey, what are you doing, huh? Don't you need to search warrant for this? No, sir, I don't. Well, could you tell me what you're looking for? Maybe I can help you find it. That won't be necessary. I found everything I need and your files are in surprisingly good order. Makes my life easier. I'm just gonna take what I need out of the office. I'll have it back to you in a couple of days. Take what you need. You can't do that. These are my files. Sorry, sir, we're the IR's. Wait a second. You have a supervisor? I would like the name of your supervisor. I'm gonna tell him what you're up to. Sure, sir, go ahead. What's his name? Bill Clinton. Bill. A wise guy. A total wise guy. Are you even listening to me? Of course I am. What is this? Some kind of club initiation? A little drama department exercise? Get a gullible assault to buy into your fairy tale? Annabelle, you are a very cute kid. You have a wonderful, vivid imagination. But I don't have time for this. I gotta. I. Arrest me. And trying to figure out whether of all the inventory we declared in our quarterly tax returns, I got your mother acting a little insane, and now this? Could you please stop patronizing me? All I know is this whole thing started because of your ridiculous talismans. Yeah, my talismans caused you and your mother to switch bodies? Yes. And if I don't figure out some stupid riddle before sundown, I'm in danger of being stuck like this forever. All right, that's it. I cannot play anymore, Annabelle. I am a grown up and I have way too much to do. I'm thrilled you came down here to torment me. But now I want you to get back on your little bicycle and pedal your tush back to school. She was absolutely right. Who? Just because you think you're talking to a child, you automatically assume that everything I say or do couldn't possibly have any real meaning for you. Well, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, Mister Bill Davidson. This could be problems for us, Buster. Big problems. I happen to think that children are the most precious resource we have. And unless we listen to them and nurture them and take every available opportunity to help them boost their self esteem, then this world doesn't stand a chance. And I could never, ever be involved with anyone who doesn't thoroughly, passionately agree. There she is. I hope you know coach Tizer's blaming you completely for our team falling apart. She says she'd give you one simple job and you blew it. Wait a minute. Let me try to understand this. You act like a spoiled, self centered little brat, pull all kinds of outrageous power trips, quit the team, and I end up getting the blame for it. Hardly seems fair, does it? It's unbelievable. Well, you know, there's a simple way to fix everything. What? Give Elena the spot. Even though we both know that Jackie deserves it more. Catch on quick, Andrews? Forget it, you little social terrorist. I've made my decision. Jackie's on the team. And I'm absolutely not gonna be intimidated by a manipulative, malicious little twelve year old. If you'll excuse me now, I have to get ready for a swim meet. Did she just, like, totally blow us off here? Completely. You're gonna tell me it was normal for you to rollerblade into the restaurant? Well, how else was I gonna get there? You ate off of Frida Debbie's plate. You licked your fingers in front of her. Well, I couldn't help her. I was starving to death. Geez, why are you making such a big deal about everything? Oh, I don't know. Maybe it was because Frida Debney had the potential to be a $2 million. Account and she said, still does. Wanna know why? Cause of me? Cause of something I totally came up with myself. Oh, really? Well, maybe you don't even need me around here anymore. Duh. What do you think I've been saying from the start? Look, I don't mean to be mean, but you are a total nag. You criticize people to death, you don't listen. You're clueless when it comes to dealing with kids. How can you possibly know what they wanna wear? You're right. I'm a jerk. I'm a total idiot. Yeah, and you need work on your jump shot, too. I'm a big weight around the neck of the creative genius. So I'll tell you something. You run the business, you balance the books, deal with the bank, secure all the credit, take all the credit, run the whole show. I'm out of here. What are you looking at. Boys, huh? He probably expects me to come chasing after him to get all, like, sad and beg him to come back. Why should I? I can't think of one good reason why mom wouldn't be better off without it. You got it. That was free. Yeah, she said she has a detailed list of questions that she wants to ask Bill before she decides whether or not she wants to come to the meet or not. Okay, that's a good one. Hi, this is Bill Davidson. I'm not home right now. Please leave a message at the beep. He's not home. Now what do I do? Find him tomorrow morning, right? I'll be there. Whoa, look who's coming. Hey. Hey. Take a look. Good comes hot stuff. Hey, baby. What are you calling baby? I'm almost 13. Old enough for me. Hey, you want to go out tonight? No way. You are fat. You smell, you got hair up your nose. What do you mean she's looking for Bill? Well, he and your mother got into a huge fight. He went ballistic and he quit. He quit? Are you sure? Honey, believe me, he won't be coming back. I'm toasting MC's like a bagel and cream cheese. Will you not rap about a bagel? Elves. Oh, man. I've been looking all over for you. Frida really needs to talk to you. Okay. Now you gotta get her to show up at the meet. I'll arrange it with the team. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Els, listen, there's something I wanna say. Actually need to say is more along the lines of. I know. I know we had that big fight, but some of the stuff that I said wasn't right. Not everything, but some things. Hey, don't back up. From what you said, a lot of stuff you said was right. It was? Yeah. Listen, Annabelle was here earlier. Annabelle was here? What'd she say? A lot of stuff I really didn't pay much attention to. And that's the point. We have to make some decisions, Elle. Some changes. Part of the reason I'm not involved with your kids is I don't know where I stand. I hold back because, well, if it doesn't work out with you and me, I don't want them to feel rejected. I know they went through it with their dad. I don't want to put them through that again. I always figured you didn't like us much. Us? Them. Them much. Anyway. Sweetheart, what I'm trying to say is. Will you marry me? No, Ann. Oh, are you kidding me? When did it get this serious? I'm not ready for this, Ellen. Don't you love me? Love you? I'm still trying to decide if I like you. Right now. I can't stand you. Hello? Hello, is anybody there? If you are, please pick up. It's me. Please pick up. Annabelle. Phil, you're there. Is Annabelle. I mean, Elmer, with you, too? Yeah. You want to talk to her? Everything all right? Sure. Kids, let me get her for you. Ellen, Annabelle is on the phone. I don't care. I never want to talk to her. The poor people trying to reach you all day. I cannot believe that you didn't tell me about you and Bill. I will never, ever, ever forgive you. Honey, don't you think that's a little harsh? No way. I don't care. Why, Annabelle, we'll discuss this later. Don't you think there's some other things that we need to talk about? No, we will not. And we won't discuss anything. You never talk to me. Why should I talk to you, Annabelle? I don't care if we ever talk again. Annabelle. I'm sorry, kiddo. She's upset. Between you and me and the phone line, I think I'm the one she's mad at. Did something happen between the two of you? Yeah. Apparently, I made a grave mistake of proposing. You did? Yeah. Oh, my God. What did she say? She turned me down so fast, my head's still spinning. Well, of course she did, Bilzers. She almost took my eye out with a talisman she threw at me. Wait a minute. You just call me Bilzer? The way she. That's exactly. Exactly what I've been trying to tell you all day. She turned you down because she's not me. She's Annabelle. Yes. Uh, Ellen, uh, Annabelle, can I talk to you? Let me ask you a question. What is that one little niggling thing that really bothers you about me? Everything okay? That's not gonna work. Ah. What's my middle name? Like you don't know. What was the name of my little dog that died while I was away at school? Oh, your dog died. So it's your fault. It's always my fault. You did give us the talismans. Look, right now that's not important. What we have to do is get you and your mom and the talismans all at the same place at the same time. Why? Because your mother said so. And it has to happen before sundown. Otherwise, this whole thing is permanent. So come on, let's move fast here. I wish it was daylight savings time. Go. Ben. Hi, misses Tar. Hi. Where are you? Still here. Guess my dumb sister forgot all about me. Hmm. Want me to give you a ride home? No one's there. My mom's working, and my sister's at a swim meet. Why don't you wait here in case she shows up? I'll go call your mom. Okay. Hey, park face, lose your diaper. Wait for your mommy. Better be going. Not so fast. What's around your neck? Hey, Rach. Hey, Miss Andrews. Do you know where Annabelle is? I don't know, and I don't care. Rach, can I talk to you like a grown up? How else would you talk to me? Miss Andrews, listen, I want to tell you something I sort of figured out for myself today. No matter how great or cool you think you are, sometimes it's not about you or your problems, you know, not really. I mean, it's kind of always about teamwork. What does this have to do with me? I know Jackie isn't your best friend or anything, but so what? She worked like a maniac to make us all look better and she's on the team. Just cause you don't like her? Too bad. You have to learn how to get along with people. I get along fine, thanks. I'm very popular. Yeah? Why? Because people really like you or because they're afraid of you? It's just like when I get a little bugged with my. My brother Ben. Uh, here, take those. Pass them out. Wear them. That'll be great. Hey, give me that. Hey, come on, start. Be careful. Here you go, Ben. What's going on, guys? Nothing, really. We were just, um, you know, helping him. Yeah. Hey, I can't see. Ben, get the front tire off the bike. Huh? Flip the clip on the front tire. Oh, yeah. Great. We'll take it to the police station, book it as evidence. Evidence? Now what should I do? It? You figure it out. Just throw it in the drag. Oh, yeah. Mom, you were so cold. You weren't bad yourself, champ. So what are you gonna do to Annabelle for forgetting to pick me up? Oh, it's just as much my fault as it is hers. Yeah, but you didn't forgive me. Cause you hate me. I don't hate you. You bug me sometimes, that's all I know. You don't hate me. I mean, Annabelle, your sister doesn't hate you. She screams at me. She tells me to get lost. She calls me names. They always have to make a deal with her and they always lose. That's because you're not as smart as your sister. Not yet, anyway. My grades are better. Well, yeah, because you study all the time. You never have any fun. I have fun. She's not the kind of fun Annabelle has. I mean, I like cleaning my room. I like things neat. I mean, she wants me to be just like her. And I'm not. I'm just what I am. I can't help it. I mean, I don't care if she's not like me. I love her anyway. You do? Yeah. What'd you think? I think you're a much cooler kid than I ever gave you credit for. 15 years I've been coaching this team. 15 town Em Andrews. This will be the first time I've ever had to forfeit. I must tell you, Andrews, I'm monumentally disappointed. Did it ever occur to you that maybe this is just as much your fault? Isn't it also your job to teach? How much pressure and responsibility can we ask these kids to take on? Well, ug, if we're gonna forfeit, let's do it. But do not, under any circumstances, think that you can blame me for this. We're not gonna force it, Rach. Come up with a really great compromise. We're gonna alternate the alternates. Jackie today and Elena next week. Why not? Elena today, Jackie today. How come? Hey, we're a team, aren't we? What are those? Oh, this is stuff your mom dropped off for us to work for the meet. My mom? She's here? She was, but she left. She had to pick up your brother. Come on, Andrews. Now that we're gonna compete, let's go walk the board. Remember, you're our number one star. You're up first. Counting on you, Andrews. All this shady Grove is counting on you. Ben. Hey, Ben. Oh, baby. Oh, it's so good to see you. Why are you here all by yourself? Where's your sister, huh? What? Mom brought me. Where is she? She wanted to go get some, but she's coming right back. Come on, let's go. Wait. Where are we going? I'm supposed to wait for mom. Oh, honey, you don't always have to listen to what your mother has to say. Come on, let's go. Are you sure you know how to do this? My dad's a mechanic. He could hot wire anything. Yes. You guys better hurry. Principal handle's gonna be out any minute. You can't drive. Yes, I can. Get in. Annabelle, you can't do this. I mean, you're gonna get us in trouble. I just can't reach the pedals. Get up there. Come on. Hurry. Call me irresponsible call me unreliable growing. Benny's up on the gas. Undependable too. What are you doing? Slow down. Well, I'm not too clever I just adore you call me unpredictable tell me I'm impractical rainbows I'm inclined to pursue to call me irresponsibility yes, I am unreliable but it's undeniably true that I am irresponsibly mad for you go on and call me unpredictable tell me that I'm impractical rainbows I'm inclined to pursue go ahead. Call me irresponsible I admit I am unreliable is undeniably true hey, I found a talisman. That I'm here is where's everybody going? Where's Ellen? Or is she gonna arrive on a jet ski? Well, hopefully, she's gonna astral project herself here. But you know what makes this line so special, Frida? Is that Ellen's really just a kid at heart. Annabelle. Father? Annabelle. Mom. What'd you do with my hair. I brushed it. You have the necklace. Yeah. Here. Okay. We have to move fast. It's almost sundown. I know. What do we do? Well, honey, we have to synchronize our thoughts. You know, think the same thought at the same time. I guess. Like we did this morning. Okay. Okay. Okay. Should we try it? Yeah. What do we think about angels? Let's go. We have 45 seconds before we forfeit. My mom. You can't dive. You can't even swim. I have to, honey, I have to do it for you. Hey. Hi. Wow. You made it. Hi. Terrific. Does anybody want any chocolate? Elle's. She doesn't like that name. Yes. Not. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Bucks county dive team finals between Shady Grove and Penfield junior High. It's a glorious spring day here in Shortbridge, New Jersey, and Shady Grove is eager to be back and diving at home. Surf. Hey, Frida, here it is. Village kids. Worth waiting for, huh? Well, it's a bit disturbing, but in a weird way, it works. Dive into our new line. Stripes and plaids. Ain't it divine? That's pretty good. We should use that. Diving first for Shady Grove is Annabelle Andrews. Ellen, look there. She's afraid of heights. Annabelle Andrews is Shady Grove's highest rated diver, holding the league's record for most points in a season. Today she will be attempting a front one and a half from 5 meters. Helen. You don't have to do this. Now, they are bleach resistant and pre shrunk, right? You have to stop them, Ellen. Ho ho ho ho. What are you doing? Annabelle, you turn the batter. Go right back up there. Come in for you, Andrews. Get up there. Get it now. Do it for me. For me, for her. Do it for all of us. Do it for Shady Grove. There you go. Way to go, Andrews. Way to go. Yes, Ellen, come to win. I can't. I can't. I can't do this. Think positive. The power of your thought. The power of your will. I can control my own destiny. Oh, mom, I think I can. Maybe I can. I probably can. It's all in our thoughts. You can do it, mom. You can do it. You can do it. You can do it. I can do it. I can do it. I can do it. It's a perfect ten for Annabelle Andrews. Much to my surprise, I'm in. I won a full range of sizes for my 420 cases. Department stores in the US. I'll deal with international later. I've never done business with anybody like you before. You have a refreshing style. Don't ever lose it. Excuse me. Coming through. You did so well, Andrews. You've got detention for the rest of the week instead of the next three years of your life. You know, I. I've been thinking about what you said about. About the uniforms. It's not a bad idea. Have your mother give. Hey, Annabelle. I know you put yourself in the line for me, and I just want you to know I really appreciate it. You deserve it. Yeah, but you know what I mean. Thank you. Next up for shady. Hello, Jack Luck. Sweetie. Ellen. Oh, honey, I've never really liked that. Is it really you? Thank God. Thank you all for coming. And we'll see you next month at the state championships. Drive safely. And don't forget to buckle up. I want a warm up suit. Yo. Annabelle was crazy hype. Hey, guys. Hey, Bob. Oh, Luke. Thanks. Thank you so much for your help. Yeah. Good night. Good night. So, is everybody themselves again? Seems that way. And this means we get to get paid then? This week? Looks like it. Cool. Don't forget our raise, boss. Raise? I talk to Annabelle. Oh, hey. Goodbye. Good luck, Ellen. Excuse me. I really don't appreciate you telling Annabelle my personal business. Oh, I'm sorry, Dinky. You're right. It's Dana and misses Barab to your daughter. Dinky, why don't you take Ben to the car and I'll meet you there? All right. Hey, great diving. Oh, great. And get this. Devney went for the whole line. You saved village kids. You did the impossible. Forget it. But just don't forget my summer camp, okay? And you could bring home some of that, too. Chocolate you have stashed in the office. So you found that, huh? Think your mom's a hypocrite? Nah, I think my mom doesn't have it as easy as I thought. Let's go home. You know, Bill, he's not. He's not perfect, but he's a good guy. Whatever you want to do, mom. I'm with you. Listen, I may have been a little hard on you about Luke. He's a good kid. How do you know? Well, he helped me out a couple of times. I think he really likes you. Listen, mom, I never really understood how hard it is for you. How much you have to do and worry about. And I never appreciated how much pressure you guys have on you all the time. I guess it's hard at any age, huh? You're a little piece of heaven, do you know that? Hey, mom, how often do you think Friday the 13th comes around, anyway? Every hundred years, if I'm lucky. You make me feel so young. You make me feel like spring has.
