HAN Dong-su, who was murdered outside Kukje Night Club? Yes, he's my friend. Then, did you order PARK Eun-gi and SONG Gi-ho to kill HAN Dong-su? I gave the order. FRIEND: THE GREAT LEGACY Too bad the treasure hunt got cancelled. See? I went last night and saw the teachers hide 'em. Imbecile! What the? Know him? He just moved here from Seoul. WOO Yong-baek! You live here? Sounds like they're fighting. Hey, you. Wanna come over? - I won this game! - No way! - No school trip? - It rained. Really? Mom's playing a game. I'll order you food soon.

Shit! Eat up, fool! Can't ya eat meat with a friend you met after 10 years? Unbelievable. I had no clue you'd end up being a monk. Shit! But I knew long ago you'd end up like this. What, fool? A gangster, fool! You sucked like shit in school! Can you even read? I can, fool! Yeah, right! The hell did you shave your head for, fool! Who cares? Worry about yourself, pal! You shit! You became a monk to do this with female visitors. Right? It's time you got punished from Buddha. Fine. Give it to me! Shit! You phony monk bastard! I'll kill ya! Shithead! You bastard! Buddha have mercy. A friend? Never heard the name. 2010, SEOUL PRISON When you're set to leave, folks come to win your favor. Do I know you? You don't remember? I used to listen to music over at your house and stuff. I'm YEON Hae-ji. A Rainbow Band member. I was close with Jin-sook. Right! Hae-ji! I remember. But what brings you here? I got a favor to ask you. What? Back in high school, I got pregnant. Then, our family moved to Ulsan. I had a son. The fool always gets into fights. He fought with your Busan boys. He's in here now. His friends say your boys can hurt him in there. He's my only kid. I can't sleep worrying. I'm sorry to come to you like this. Can you stop 'em from harming him? What's his name? CHOI Sung-hoon. Boss! He's a tough kid. Last year, he clashed with our boys over taking Yangsan Temple. He hacked our boys with a sickle. Our boys became cripples, sir. Got his family here? Just a couple young fools tagging along. An order came from the outside to kill him, sir. That's him, sir. Hey, kid! Come here! What is it? Are you Sung-hoon? Who's asking? Bow! You fool! He's Big Boss LEE Joon-suk! Really? I heard about you. Had a run-in with our boys on the outside? Yeah... So what? Young fool talking with no manners. Don't fight in here. Even when I get out, got that? Yes, sir. You, too? If they don't touch me first, I won't. It's okay. Smoke. How old are ya? Twenty-seven, sir. Did you attack knowing our boys got the temple? Yes, sir. Fool's got balls. You know me, sir? I'm an old friend of your mom's. I see. How long you in for? One year. I'll be out in June. Call me when you're out. Let's grab some food with your mom. Yes, sir. He pushed! What? You shithead! You son of bitch! CHOI Sung-hoon! Think you're strong? Hide your claws. Ain't good to show 'em first. Look at the time! If it's past midnight, it's the 28th! After 17 years inside, let him out now! Number 1733! Discharged! $7,442 left in provisional holdings... Check if it's right. Can you put this in... for these people here? Put it in yourself later. Sign here, please. DISCHARGE CONFIRMED LEE JOON-SUK His release is today, too. Let him out. Great to meet you, sir! I'm KO Jo-tae, sir! Welcome back, boss! The fool... He didn't come? Sir VP is getting ready to welcome you in Busan, sir. He's the VP? Hey! Yes, sir! Get in. There's an accident up ahead. - Exit off the ramp. - Yes, sir. We can use the Internet on phones these days, sir. Who's he? Never seen him. Don't know. Big Boss scouted him from the inside. Snow Ice! It's marvelous! Snow Ice is cool! It's really good for men. Please, sir. Why you! It's best to avoid an attack, sir! Welcome back, sir! Welcome back, sir. The VP is looking good. No, sir. No, fool. You look good. Sir Chairman is quite ill and will meet you next month. Let's go in, sir. It's an unlisted phone. They won't know who the user is. Feel free to use it, sir. Why is this soju so weak? There's no Jinro soju? But this doesn't give you hangovers, sir. Soju should make your head pound the next day. Anyway... Why'd you stop visiting me? I'm sorry, sir. I got really busy, and couldn't go. What's the family business these days? This and that, sir. Call that an answer, fool! Sir. Rest a few days. How about a trip abroad? Bastard... Got big, huh? Catch me now, darling! Joon-suk? Who do you think is faster? What? Top swimmer, CHO Oh-ryun or a turtle in a swimming race? Don't know. What's your name again? It's KO Jo-tae, sir! Great name. How old? Thirty-three, sir! But... What are you doing? Pardon? Why follow me and not go home, fool? To get you anything you might need, sir. Really? See Eun-gi's boys tailing me? Go cut up the damn annoying tails. Bastards. Yes, sir! Fool! Come back! I was kidding. I knew you were, sir! Fool. You look soft, but got guts. Thank you, sir! Goodnight, sir! When will he get the picture? Heard how he talks to me? Boss Joon-suk made many mistakes, sir. He's testing my patience. Goodnight, sir! Joon-suk! Sorry to make you come. Don't be. We open at night anyway. This is nothing compared to how you looked after my son. Call me anytime you need a driver. I called and double checked. REHABILITATION CENTER But who's SONG Ki-ho? We stood trial together. What? Want me to butcher someone again? How long have you been here? Just go, sir. I gave up long ago. I didn't come to ask you for a job. But... I'll ask one thing. Why'd you do it? I'm not sure either. Fine. Take good care of yourself. Guess he gave you some money? When I came out after 10 years... he just gave me dope. That's why I ended up like this. Eun-gi... I complained to the bastard just once! Know what he did to me? Hello? Where are you? Sir Chairman. Now... I can't cherish memories for much longer. You take 'em all. You wasted your youth away because of me. No, sir. I followed you on my own, sir. Two weeks before you got out... Eun-gi came to me. Said I should officially retire... and move to Jeju Island for fresh air. So? Did you say you'll go? No. I said the air is fresh here. That bastard! Gangsters don't retire. There's nothing else to do. Right? Stay outside. Eun-gi keeps quiet and is smart. And he gets things done right. So I trusted him. After a year, some boys started coming... saying who got killed and disappeared. I later realized... my close boys like you vanished off in order. Son of a bitch! He cut off my arms and legs while I was hospitalized. What? Sir VP sent me, boss. It's a ticket for Thailand. You can leave anytime within the month. Let's go. Take it. It has about 2 million. Should I spend this? Or use it to band up? These days... I keep thinking of... Big Boss, your father. I wonder why... 1963, BUSAN Thinking compensation from Japan will jump start the economy... some cunning Korean Japanese... will take over every little thing to make cash. So, the fishermen... are illegally selling off goods to Fukuoka gangs? Right! Things worth $1 at most here... could be worth 20 times that in Japan. Sang-gon? What do you think? When the state is in chaos like now... we should show 'em that Busan fists are alive and well. No way. They must pay major bribes to smuggle things out. Think army jerks will stand losing their cash-cow? Stay out of it, fool! Sometimes Yakuza and soldiers come by to eat there and stuff. Fool! Know who he is? Busan's top fist, Mr. LEE Chul-ju? Then, who are you? Shoeblack, KIM Hyung-du, sir. It's more fish than last week! Is this it? Half of it is deposit money! The union is watching us! We can't do this for petty cash! Look! Look! Look! The union promised! They'll overlook things till today. So, go on home. Hurry up and leave! What? Bastards! Damn shitheads! Pulling out knives? If you're Yakuzas, you should work with the big boys! Who's your boss? Bring him out! Kill 'em! Hyung-du! Are you okay? Hyung-du! Merinol Hospital Damn bastards! Why use Sashimi knives in a men's fight! We're not fish! Damn cowards! No! They did illegal things first. So they won't be able to squeal! Sir! Look outside! Search every corner! Hyung-du! Get up! Sang-gon, you stay behind and stall for us! Run up! Hide here at least half a day! Even if I get caught, you stay put! LEE Chul-ju's not here. Who tipped him off? Freeze! Damn slimy gangster! Let's go! 2010, SEOUL PRISON Did you read my letters? 2010, SEOUL PRISON Nope. I just ripped 'em all up. As I said before, I didn't call the cops. They came on their own. But you prayed for me to get punished! Do you even think you're getting punished? No way, man! So, you'll go out and be a gangster again? So what if I'm a gangster! You phony monk! Yeah? 2001 ULSAN What's this? Cost me $450! That's it? Got it from working as a waiter. My girlfriend's birthday is soon. So we can go party. What's with your face? It's nothing. Fought with some Busan boys. Busan boys? Got in a brawl with them at dawn. Where? Found 'em. The three by the door. Go keep the car running. Hey! You can't go alone. What if they report you? They know your face. Sis! I told you! Sung-hoon and Yong-baek are the top fists around here. Really? I saw your pics before. Let's be friends. Let's hang out often. Shit! Right on! Right on! Where to? Let's hit Busan! Let's roll! That bastard! Wanna go see a ship? What ship? Take me there. It's close. What about Yong-baek? That's an American ship. It goes around the world. Why? Wanna go somewhere else? I hate living with my stepfather. I wanna run far away. Where's that fool! Police? Come quick! It's urgent! Sung-hoon! Sung-hoon! Where are you! Sung-hoon! Damn bastards! Sung-hoon! What were you doing? Shit! I should've gone with him. If someone found him and called for help... Shit! I didn't look at him! You dirty whore! Living with all those men, wanna fuck every man you see? I'll sell you off to a whore house! Come here! Get up! You bitch! You whore! Fine! Sell me off! You psycho bitch! Dang, I'm starving. Stupid shitty thing! Two bowls of noodles! Yes, boss! Have a good trip? Two noodles! Enjoy your meal. Couples fight and stuff, fool! Then, they get close. You'll see. I'll fix your mama's trampy ways. For good! Sung-hoon! Son of a bitch! Why'd you marry her! You shitty asshole! Mom's not your sandbag! You bastard! 2010 ULSAN Wearing a wig like that, who'd recognize you? Had it rough, huh? PRINCESS SINGING BAR I returned the carts. There's no record of it. Go to Room 10, sir! I missed you so much, sir! I really missed you, sir! I couldn't even go when you came out. I counted down the days, sir! Boss... Who's he, sir? Glad to meet you! I'm KO Jo-tae, sir! Honestly? I don't know what's what now. Maybe I shouldn't act like the owner after 17 years away. My head's all messed up. But you're the real owner, sir! You didn't rot in jail for 17 years just for you! And your father is our gang's founder! Of course you should be the next in charge! I'm not KIM Jong-il. Boss... I lived like a dog all this time. Sir, if you don't plan to... I'll do it alone. I'll kill Eun-gi. You shitheads! Think I haven't got cash to pay! Know how close I am to Boss Joon-suk? I thought if I followed Big Boss, I'd be in the Busan Family. Why do you wanna be one of us? Busan Gang rules in Korea! But it's dang hard. He doesn't know anything and complains. Never pays me, but says to get dope. Is he a fake LEE Joon-suk? Sung-hoon gets out on the 10th? Yeah. Can we start up a hostess bar in your name or Sung-hoon's? A hostess bar? I'll fund it. Sung-hoon! You poor thing! Try this! Back off! Sorry you took all the blame. Forget it, man. What's that? Know Joon-suk? Your friends said you'd like this. The hell? You two dating? He's out! He flipped over it! He asked if you and me are getting married. Don't know. Probably sensed something. Welcome! Welcome! Your mama got loaded! Laughing so much! Aren't ya drinking? If you force it in and make a hole... what will it look like? What? Stiff! What? A stiff little hole! It's me. Joon-suk is living with a girl who runs a bar in Ulsan. Ulsan? Who's the girl? Someone from way back. But sir... She's got a helluva kid. He clashed with us a year ago over a temple in Yangsan. The Ulsan kids, right? I remember. Right, sir. I heard our boys tried to do him in on the inside. But Joon-suk stopped it. Really? Is he in Chittagong's gang? No, sir. He's no gangster, sir. Got just a little dike. And, sir... Is Joon-suk on dope? Did you spill? Yes, sir. I said you tell me to buy dope without paying me. I was damn mad, sir. No, I acted like it, sir. Good work. Here's 20 grand. You use half of it. Use the rest to buy the boys beer and dope as needed. Round up the boys. Ask if you need more. Thank you, sir! What if... they suspect you using money like crazy? I'll say Dad died and I sold off everything. Did he really die? He's almost about to. He's practically gone on Al-Qaeda disease, sir. What? The sickness that kills your brain, sir. Let's do this. Say your father is very ill and you got his property rights. Great thinking, sir! Sorry to ask you to come all the way to Ulsan. Don't be. Meeting in Busan is out for us, too. Got to try some whale meat. I expect this situation. But if anyone dies, our hands are tied. Of course. I know. How about a drink? No need. I got early morning meetings. Stay here. No use having a cop and a gangster being seen together. What? Finish it up. I'm full, sir. I ate till late. Know why gangsters always ask each other if they ate? Why, sir? Cuz most of 'em struggle and have it hard. Sometimes they can't eat. That sucks, doesn't it? Why? Don't care to live like that? You only live once. A man should live it up. Then, wanna take over Busan with me? Yes, sir. I'm not kidding. I'm not either. 18,000 won in all. So, how many boys you got? Don't worry about 'em, sir. I know strong guys in 3 different cities. Then, let's all get together sometime and eat. Just give 'em cash, sir. No need to eat and drink. Just pay 'em and they'll work. Thank you, sir. You mean just pay 'em and not try to be a family? Well, they gotta get paid to wanna be a family. Thank you, sir. By the way... when we join forces and take over Busan... who'll take charge? We'll see. If you got more boys following you, you'll be. If there are more following me, I'll be. Gotta have a gang to be a leader. Then, it comes down to money again. One more thing... What? Can I call you Big Boss? Sure. Yes. Why become blood brothers? Pardon? Why do boys band as one like brothers? Well, cuz they do jobs together... And? They grow up together... Cuz they starved together. Been on the run together. Almost died together! Sobbed aloud together! That's how you become a family. Not by just paying 'em. Sir! 1963, BUSAN SECURITY COMMAND I'm sorry. It's my fault. We sold everything to get you out. We lost everything. The others? We all got scattered apart. Some of 'em got caught and dragged away. Who's behind this? Call your Yakuza informant. It's Murakami Ken. He's the head of Hiroyoshi Yakuzas. He paid 20 grand to have you arrested. FUKUOKA, JAPAN Don't pull anything in Japan. Even other Yakuzas won't touch that damn bastard. If we came into the tiger's den, we should see his face. Find him! There's no other way out! If we don't kill him, we'll get killed! We only have one chance. Sir? Are you okay, sir? Boss! Boss! Are you okay! Boss! I heard Korean President PARK went to the U.S. and said... Korea will send soldiers to Vietnam for financial support. start going around Korea. Now, big money will How about doing business with us? Sounds good. for petty cash. But we won't be your henchmen in charge of Busan. I, LEE Chul-ju, will be Japanese or American goods... nothing can come in without going through Busan! 1964, BUSAN CHA Sang-gon! 1964, BUSAN MYUNG Tae-sup! GONG Chi-sung! Busan is now one big family. If we work separately, we'll just end up fighting. Then, we'll just make petty cash. But if we band together, we could work millions! Wait and see. From now on... American and Japanese goods... will come flooding in through Busan. 1964, MISS BUSAN PAGEANT Slot machines. 1964, MISS BUSAN PAGEANT TVs, fridges, stereos, watches, diamonds, gold... For every one legal import, 10 will be smuggled! The world is changing fast. We gotta adjust... and change along with it! Cops, judges, soldiers, customs, newspapers... grease 'em all up good with money. The era of ruling with fists is over. Now, money is power. I forgot to give it to you last time. It's your father's. You take it. When you followed me off that day... know what your father said? 'At my old age, know what I live for?' What, sir? Being sick. I've been on the inside for a while, too. Prison is not a place to be. Can't you settle things a different way? When I had a hard time over my friend... you told me something that my dad used to say. 'If you don't do it now, the result is obvious.' 'You'll get done in later.' I guess making regrettable choices in life... that's a gangster. Jjanggu is Eun-gi's right hand. He disappears for days high on drugs. Yu-sik has the most boys. But they aren't tight, so he's the weakest to fight. Damn it! Chew likes gambling and has no sense of loyalty. Just futz with 'em for now. Remember... no one dies. To Big Boss! Cheers! Cheers! Thank you, sir! Make yourselves comfortable. Get lost, you son of a bitch! But I'm a paying costumer! Get out! I came to give you business. I'm not selling to you! Never changed! What? Bastard! Is that you? Sung-hoon? Long time no see! Haven't seen you in years! Good to see ya! All grown up and helping your mama's business, huh? Come with me. Let's talk inside. You still have my last name? CHOI? - Unbelievable. - He's not your son! When I was in grade 4, Mom first got married. I thought having a dad like other kids would be great. But he always fought with Mom and hit her. Took all Mom's money from the bar and gambled. Such a complete bastard. That guy back then? And all the others after him. So ever since I was young... I hated all men. Stepfathers, teachers, costumers.... Shit! I wanted to grow up fast. That's all I'd think. Then, one day... Mommy... got drunk and cried. She said she made a mistake and had me. And her life got fucked. Don't remember your real dad at all? Only his funeral. I was too young to remember much. Said he got beaten to death. A born mistake is bound to make mistakes. You just got out. Why'd you drink so much! Sorry, boss. No need to apologize to me. Go on in. Goodnight, sir. Boss? What? Thank you, sir. Sure. Watch your hangover. Not that, sir. What? Inside the pen. It was the first time... a grown man... ever took my side. Thank you, sir. Why no batting cages in this part of town? Son of a bitch! What, bastard? What? You called me, fool. Hey, boys. Drag the kid out. Bastards! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! You asshole! Son of a bitch! Being in there suits ya! Son of a bitch! You'll pay for this, bastards! Remember? You did this to my head. Fool! Go to hell, shithead! Light him. Burn him for 10 sec. Barbecue party! What? Something wrong? Sung-hoon... You wanted him under you? That's why you made me this bar? Men like us crave to be in charge in our own ways. Politicians, businessmen... athletes... and gangsters. We're all the same. Especially... guys like Sung-hoon and me with boiling blood. What do you mean? Sung-hoon hates losing, too. He had to protect himself since he was young. He grew up knowing if you're weak, you're beat. No use trying to stop him now. He'll reach his potential under me. I'll make sure of that. But what if he dies? If he does... what will you do? Give me 10 receipts. Mom says she'd rather make offerings than pay taxes. What? Buddha hates this kind of money? I'll take it. We can use this money. But since we're a small temple, I'll ask about the receipts. Whatever you say, monk. Why are you doing this? Do what? Don't you hate me? No, fool. Just think you're pathetic. Kiss up to your boss... and pray hard for Yong-baek's soul. Back then... I went to his cremation. A worker there said it'll take over 2 hours. He told us to go eat and come back later. That was it. Someone dying... Just say it, fool. Yong-baek died cuz of me. No. It's not because of anyone else. It's just retribution for a former life. So? Saying that to make me feel better? No, I'm saying live right. What? I'll keep praying so that you'll sin less and be good. Cut the crap, you asshole. Just put up lanterns with the money. You phony monk! You stupid fool. Call that a tattoo? I know, sir. My tattoo's kinda weak. But... I got charisma, sir. Right. Think what you want. Going home already, sir? I'm taking a dump. Sir! Go to Starbucks. It's really clean there, sir! All that instant food! WOO Jang-chun would be horrified. Who's WOO Jang-chun? Don't know? The seedless watermelon? Why no seeds? I don't believe this. You heard of WOO Jang-chun, right? Boss Jang-chun? If I see his face, maybe it'll ring a bell. You bird brain! During Japanese rule, Dr. WOO Jang-chun... made seedless watermelon and... What was that? Jo-tae's undergoing brain surgery. And Jumbo will end up a cripple for life. It's me. Why are you doing this, sir? Thought you could use a vacation abroad. Looks like you misunderstood, sir. Don't you know I hate going on planes? I thought you wanted to get rid of me. I'll go to where you are, sir. Ever been to the big seawall? No, but I'll find it. I'll be there at noon fishing with just my driver. Let's work out the details, sir. Fine.Let's talk in person. It's inevitable. What was that? What, sir? Why throw coins out? When I see roadkills, I throw 'em coins. So if they're still alive, they can call 911. Ever hit one while driving? I don't think so. Why, sir? It's best to run 'em down good. Otherwise, you were killed. CHOI Sung-hoon? What? I heard your real last name is HAN. Catch anything? Have a seat, sir. Forget it. I'll just stand. After Dong-su hit on Boss Hyung-du... he sat at a place like this. He suddenly asked me who'd win a swimming race. CHO Oh-ryun or a turtle... After he died... I thought long and hard about what he meant. So? Did you find out? Not sure if it's right... But maybe he was talking about having to fight between friends. He probably meant, it's all useless. Something like that? I guess. Could be. I'll just take Haeundae with my boys. How about having the rest of Busan like before, sir? I smell a rat. No matter what... Eun-gi's up to something. On Sunday... arm up all our boys. Yes, sir. You go take a piss. Yes, sir! I was so shocked. You're mom brought this little kid... to Boss Dong-su and cried. I thought it was his nephew. I had no idea! You stood trial together? Right. Since Boss Joon-suk fessed up to everything... I got out real soon. Back then, I just did as I was told. The fact is... Joon-suk is the one who planted me under your dad. After that happened... it was really hard on me. Being close and spending every day with Boss Dong-su... I saw his humane sides. I came to really like him. He was a hard, tough man, but very open. I don't really have any memories of him. Just tell me your message to Boss Joon-suk. To be honest... I never saw Joon-suk do anyone in himself. He never gets blood on his hands. He always got the little boys to do the job. That's why you wanted to see me? Know who got the order to kill your dad? Wanna talk to him? I was just 19. What would I know? I was so stupid and regret it like hell. What is taking charge... that friends must order to kill each other? Yeah? Oh, no. What do we do, sir? What? The Chairman passed away. No matter what happens... you stay back and quiet. What? Gather up the boys. Scatter out and stay low. Make the money last. Don't call each other. Get rid of this shit! KIM HYUNG-DU Everyone pull out, now. Let's go! Everything's set? Don't worry, sir. Good. Hurry! Get lost! Shit! The hell? Where are you? Outside, sir. It's all done. Come in and greet the others. Why? Wants me to greet 'em. Bow to 'em. Hello? There's something I have to get off my chest. You're a gangster, too. Must've used tools before. When you do someone in... you give a few blows and make 'em cripples. People don't cut up people that brutally. Look! Get those bastards! He didn't resist much. So, I was going to stop. But Eun-gi, that bastard... I keep having nightmares. I can't take it anymore. That day... I went over quite late. I heard you and Dong-su fighting over Jin-sook. That night... Dong-su held me. Instead of Jin-sook... me... It's Capt. KIM, sir. Yes? no one will die? Didn't you promise me Bring me all the bastards who killed at the hospital. I have no choice. Now, it's war between you and me. In a hospital at 2 AM today... a top Busan gangster head has been murdered. The suspects lured police away and went inside the hospital. Police suspect it occurred over a power war between gangs. YTN news, KIM In-chul. It's okay. We need to talk. You stay far back. A while ago... you met Eun-gi in private? Yes. Why didn't you tell me? It wasn't anything important. Just rambled on some shit. Cops can't cover for you on this one. You said it's best to run 'em down good. I'll deal with the cops. Till I call you back... stay quiet for 2 or 3 years. When you arrive and call me... I'll send you the money you need. Go on. You dropped the cigarette and gave the sign... to do my dad in? Where to, sir? Anywhere... No one calls me over. Got any close friends? My best friend died a while back. Why? Because... I made a mistake. Joon-suk! Joon-suk! They're calling us. It's time to go.
