news oh yeah the traffic is terrible of all the holidays labor day is the worst please have you found out anything about elizabeth oh yeah she's missing well that's brilliant i'm the one who told you that oh no no not exactly mr corbin you told me she was gone well there are a lot of people who are gone they get up they go they're gone my own wife is gone what that's right if you lived in one of the garden spots of the east where the air was good where everywhere you look was a picture postcard where would your wife go on labor day weekend to brooklyn the visit of the sister inspector since you seem to know where your wife is could we stay on the subject of mine for a couple of minutes like i said she's missing i checked all the hotels the motels morgues jails city hospitals within a radius of 250 miles no elizabeth corbin no one even fitting her description definitely missing i was hoping you'd bring me something more than that i did a sandwich when my wife is at home i don't need regular i think it'd be the same over here oh really not very hungry good because i only bought you one sandwich hey there must be something more you can do i'll bet it's in there i'll bet inspector oh now this is what i call a kitchen oh my wife would fell if she saw this kids cause she'd clean it up a little bit i said there must be something more you can do for instance oh you're the policeman not me now that we've straightened that out where's the mustang nothing has been straightened out inspector three days ago my wife left this house she hasn't been seen or heard from since i've only been married two weeks this was supposed to be our honeymoon i'm sure you're considered something of a joke around these parts and i'm being a very bad sport but it just so happens i love my wife very much and i'm worried sick about her so suppose you cut out all this the schtick i believe you call it and start giving me some help mr corbin according to your own report your wife left after the two of you had an argument she left of her own free will which she has every right to do she is now staying away which again she has every right to do therefore the police are under no obligation whatsoever to get involved in your domestic problems except as a matter of courtesy now where's the mustard in the refrigerator thank you for your information i've alerted every troop in these to watch for a car the yellow starfish gt with michigan plates suspect i've got a photograph of her in the bedroom any way we can circulate it yeah she robs a bank we can put it in all the post offices oh come on will you mr corbin i've seen it happen a thousand times a person is missing everybody gets hysterical the last minute the missing person walks in cool calm and collected here you'll eat something you feel better i guess i am hungry what do you got there oh it's boiled ham on white with mayonnaise and lettuce you'll love it what's that that's pastrami but you wouldn't like that i like italian food that's just right come on we'll leave it on the terrace tyler y'all better mr corbin not really you will you were a horrific spot you got here it is isn't it it's a wedding present the whole house no just a loan of it for my company i work for unified motors on the assembly line right matter of fact i'm vice president in charge of production and design for the starfish division oh that explains a lot of things what why you drive a starfish that lousy cars you know i own one once was a real limit inspector you find my wife i'll make sure you get a new one what about your wife's family she doesn't have any both her parents were killed in an air crash two years ago she has no brothers no sisters inspector i'll tell you the truth i'm scared to death it's not like elizabeth what'd you find tomorrow elizabeth has a rather dangerous hobby inspector she drives racing cars matter of fact that's how we met starfish built a couple of test models last year and she tried out for the team she uh she didn't get the job but she did get the boss on the one condition that she stopped risking her neck so she agreed and i thought that was the end of it and then and then suddenly last wednesday she announced she was going into the six-hour watkins glen next year anyhow one thing led to another and the next thing i knew she she left the house i heard her start the car and i heard her drive off i haven't seen her since you always leave your keys in the car no no she she has a set of her own yeah when she when she didn't show up the next morning i thought maybe she'd had an accident 90 miles an hour is a normal cruising speed but that's when i called you and you you said there was nothing reported my next thought was that maybe she'd been kidnapped but there's been no calls no notes i don't know what else it could be inspector i i don't know how else to explain it i don't either yeah i'll make sure the state troopers keep a sharp lookout i think it would be wise to alert the city cops in manhattan too why there oh the stores mr club in the stores missing wives head for department stores like pigeons the capistrano swallows whatever hey maybe you ought to put a notice in the paper that you won't be responsible for our debts no no inspector i don't think that'll be necessary elizabeth's pretty rich girl is that right how rich oh 10 12 million dollars now there's rich mr corbin suppose something would have happened to hey god forbid who would get all that money well i don't know we never discussed that uh i would i guess you guess inspector if you read executive magazine you know my present salary at um is 450 000 a year plus stock options plus bonuses plus expense account last year that came to just a little under 1 million bucks i don't think anybody could accuse me of marrying elizabeth for her money the fire in lone pine last night claimed the lives of donna pilfery iii and her 86 year old grandfather edmund it's believed that the elder peal tree dozed off with a cigarette will mean good evening my son oh god you guys scared the hell out of me i'm sorry but you really uh scared the hell out of me yes i suppose i must

right calling me that mr corbin can i talk to you in the library for a minute please please all right mr corbin what's going on here i already told you inspector that that woman is pretending to be my wife i know what you told me but it doesn't make much sense does it your wife goes hey when she comes back she's not your wife anymore what does it mean i don't know a motive mr corbin there has to be a motive even a country cop knows that well maybe what we need here inspector is a city cop meaning what like no offense is back there but living in a small town like this maybe you just don't come into contact with what tell me mr corbin what is so terrific about this case it would take dick tracy to figure it out and where do i sound like i come from sleepy hollow 28 years i worked for the city of new york eight years pounding a beat six years on a patrol car 14 years in homicide i took my wife and my pension and i came up here because it was some place the only thing a policeman could die from was boredom and so far mr corbin your little problem has done very little to relieve the monotony i'm i'm sorry i'm sorry inspector i guess i am pretty upset sorry too i'm a cop shouldn't lose my temper should listen to all sides all right you say this woman is the phony okay if that's true what's the reason what's a motor i don't know this afternoon you told me your wife was rich is it possible she's after her money what do you mean by that well i'm just asking because if she is wow she has picked a pretty good way of going after it which is what suppose a new elizabeth appeared on the scene and she could convince everyone that she is the real one are you forgetting one thing inspector she'd never be able to convince me you're forgetting one thing mr corbin she might not have to what do you mean well if you're right then i were you and watch what i ate my god what can i do try to think think of someone else who saw your wife up here two others three others their safety and numbers although i don't know their mother must be some when you first came up here ah no no it was late at night the next morning when you went out no we didn't go out why not you're on a honeymoon oh that's right that's right did anybody drop by a delivery man no i don't think a mailman no the box is down the road elizabeth hello oh did you want something well is it mrs carbonine uh mrs score i'm mr corbin oh well how do you do i'm rebecca foster vice chairperson of the ladies village preservation society the lsvp foster come on in please oh well inspector levine what brings you here is

the house something is wrong isn't it no no mrs foster did you get a good look at mrs corbin i mean are you positive you would know her if you saw her again now inspector my joints may be stiffening a bit but there's nothing wrong with my eyesight of course i know her why we talked for almost an hour she seemed very interested in our work but she couldn't find her checkbook and she promised me that if i'd come back later she'd make us a very generous contribution mrs foster i am delighted you did come back you have no idea how delighted i am and after you've seen my wife i can personally promise you a very large donation well now that's very generous of you mr corbin thank you very much where is your wife uh i don't know you don't suppose you skipped out do you sorry it takes so long you moved everything around while i was gone sugar bowl in the refrigerator elizabeth darling uh look who's here oh mrs foster you did come back i'm so glad would you like a cup of coffee well yes thank you miss coleman i think i would i'll get another cup thank you excuse me you mean you do know her of course i do ginger wife isn't she my wife has red hair no i would have remembered that what's the matter have i said something wrong thank you for your help mrs foster i'll see you to your car well thank you very much inspector good night good night good night mrs foster is there any more coffee mrs corbin i'm afraid i'm nodding off sure father in the kitchen thank you things aren't going very well for you are they darling what are you up to you wouldn't want me to spoil the surprise would you inspector don't do that i have to talk to you why don't you quit while you're behind every time i give you a chance it gets even worse do you want to hear the latest disaster what now this car this starfish the one your wife drove back in it has the same license numbers the ones she drove away in now look your wife seems like a very attractive reasonable intelligent woman why don't you go inside and try to patch things up you don't believe a single word i've been saying mr corbin you don't need a policeman what you need is maybe a marriage counselor maybe even all right go ahead say it a doctor all right inspector i'll make an agreement with you you go in there right now and you and terry mr corbin check her out ask her questions make her give you names dates places and after that if you're still satisfied that's elizabeth corbin i'll go and have my head examined how do we have a deal i would have my head examined but you let me do the talking that tongue of your starts wagging i'm gonna let my friend sydney make sandwiches out of it mrs corbin poor man's exhausted can i ask you a couple of questions please certainly inspector but let's talk in the library that way father keller can get some sleep this is corbin earlier today dear uh mr corbin told me all about the argument you two had on thursday night it's wednesday wednesday wednesday night you're right you're right would you mind telling me your version my inspector there isn't really very much to tell danny issued one of those ultimatums that men are so fond of and i replied by telling him that gloria steinem had freed the slaves and from then on it just went from bad to worse and i guess we were both pretty unreasonable and it ended when i left if i'd known the effect it was gonna have on danny i never would have you took the car yeah you knew he always left the keys in it huh well i have my own set do you have any identification mrs cortman sure here thank you it's quite a collection you ever have cash is your driver's license elizabeth douglas yes my maiden name must wear corrective lenses wear your glasses mrs clubman you're on contact lenses i'm very nearsighted inspector you're not asking

inspector like you don't have to take my word for it call him on the phone if you don't believe me if he exists at all oh he exists all right he's a psychiatrist in gross point he's quite a well-known one and he says you've been a patient of this for almost five years he's crazy isn't that funny that's what he says about you inspector i'm not but i will be if this this keeps up oh mr corbin as a policeman i should say you're a crazy person and the case is closed but as a native of new york i'm an expert on craziness and i have the craziest feeling you're not as crazy as you sound go go on please well when things don't fit together i get this tickling in the brain and right now my brain is tickling to beat the band do you want to hear what i think might be happening now i said mike because it's just a tickle now go on i'm listening okay now get ready for a few what-ifs all right what what if what if what if number one what if someone else knew about your wife's situation 12 million dollars and no family a couple of someone else's and they had a plan worked out to take her place without anybody knowing about it maybe even going to europe so no one would ever find out now we come to what if number two see if you agree with this what if you come along unexpectedly and you marry her before they get a chance to make their move you're a big complication to them successful wealthy in your own right beyond suspicion as we say in the business not even a chance of them cutting you in so what is the only way they can salvage their operation get rid of me exactly exactly but how not by murder not unless they have to i mean too many things could go wrong especially with two people disappearing so now we come to what if number three what if they could drive you crazy or get enough people to believe you're crazy they put you away anyway then with you in the laughing academy they can go on with their plan as though you never existed that's it well what do you think i i think you're a genius that makes two of us but we need a documents something from the city of detroit or the state of michigan about your wife uh photographs fingerprints something like that and our friends were very smart on that score too every office in the country is shut tighter than the drum because of the labor day weekend i'm afraid we're completely stymied until tuesday tuesday yeah what am i supposed to do in the meantime help me i'll try but you gotta help too well tell me anything stop running around yelling at everybody play along with them conserve your energy and keep looking for what for the floor on their plan mr corbin there is no such thing as the perfect crime except in the movies every crime like every gem has a floor i know that because my father used to be a jeweler and what we have to do is search for the floor on their plan and then we've got them but you got to hold on to your nerves because they're going to make it very rough on you now the first thing you have to do well have you two discovered whose key does what and to who absolutely your key fits his car and his key fits your car and they both lived happily ever after mrs corbin i was just telling your husband you ought to get a full night's sleep otherwise he's liable to see more dead bodies disappear do uh you have a guest room or some other place where he won't be disturbed sure the room next two hours is there a connecting door no why well with you in the next room it would be very easy for amanda walking asleep mr corbin why don't you go up try to relax everything's gonna be just fine huh yes sir all right good night danny pleasant dreams why are you saying inspector you think danny's crazy please go listen that's what doctors say all i know is i don't think you should stay here tonight he's really very upset in my opinion he could explode get really violent surely you're exaggerating you didn't see him before i had to humor him i had to tell him i was on his side i even made up a [ __ ] and bull story to calm him down inspector i really appreciate your concern but i can't leave danny tonight i can't leave him any night if i hadn't done it before none of this would be happening okay you want to use one of these not really no there's nothing to it that's why they're so dangerous you just aim and pull the trigger i don't want it please take it it'll make me feel better about leaving here alone tonight and maybe tomorrow we'll get a doctor to take a look at him okay good night good night inspector thanks for everything really gotta get out no bang bang

the fancy summer resorts in america a psychopath has to come to this one and then my friend is gone inspector i swear to you be quiet what you've got to swear to i don't want to hear this time all i wonder some answers and for a change they better be the right one mrs corbin what was sydney doing here danny ordered some lunch my wife ordered the lunch before she disappeared her face come on mrs coleman well i heard voices in the kitchen and when i went in cindy saw me and he said uh hello mrs corbin it's absurd cindy was getting more and more confused because he knew me from the other day and uh danny was getting more and more upset and no but that's not true i'm not gonna tell you again mrs corbin when did you dye your hair and why this morning early i thought it would help calm danny down inspector all he said since i came back was that his real wife had red hair and that's true i mean i did have red hair when danny and i first met anyway i thought it would help him if he could just see me the way i used to be you know the way he wanted me to be i understand i came in here i sat down with father kelleher the next thing we knew sydney was calling for help from the kitchen danny was there screaming hysterically and threatening sydney with a die specter i am not going to stay here and listen to any more of these lies i am not you want to go downtown i can arrange it and a straight jacket i tried to use the gun that you gave me i know don't tell me i loaded it with blank so nobody would get hurt at the first sound of a shot my man was supposed to run in here like a rabbit yeah that was a mistake that was the worst mistake i ever made in my life it was god's will inspector we've all made our share of mistakes i should have realized how sick this poor man was i should have insisted he be given proper medical attention yesterday before it was too late all right now you've listened to them were you listening to me now i'm listening to you look at the results inspector sydney knew she wasn't my real wife that's why they killed him don't you see they had to before he could talk to you because you would have believed him you would have believed your friend that's right i would have believed suddenly she stabbed him i took the knife away from her that's why i was holding her when you came in i mean why would i kill my only witness my one remaining hope who knows what is a crazy person i'm not crazy they murdered my only witness what do i have to do before you believe me bring sydney back can you do that mr corbin get your jacket i'm taking you and i should have taken you in yesterday hello yeah i don't believe it did he say anything i figured i'll be right over it's unbelievable what is it the best news you'll ever hear sydney's not dead he's not no the ambulance boys they found a heartbeat nothing fancy but enough to keep him going until they get him into surgery he said he wanted to know who was minding the store i don't have the time to take you in right now suddenly comes first time hey no dean you can't i'll be back as soon as i can don't leave me like this god knows what they'll do lavine come back let me know i'm a dead man uh what is it about men when they're completely helpless they're like little boys oh danny you're acting like you're afraid of me i mean what's there to be afraid of look at me how can you possibly hope to get elizabeth's money there are lawyers executors ah yes little men who worship written instructions and they'll get their instructions from a very exclusive bank in london where an account was opened some months ago in your wife's name i myself personally flew over and deposited ten thousand pounds along with some not bad looking signatures you know the terrific thing about banks as long as you give them the money they'll let you be anybody that you say you are see danny i think we've got it covered except for one thing huh sydney's still alive and he'll tell what really happened hmm just might do that mighty then again he might not what do you mean well you know how accommodating hospitals can be especially to a solicitous priest priest you mean your friend buzzy forget it's too late you'd never get by levine where is he anyway keller keller gone some time ago before levine before how danny you really got to do something about that extension almost anybody could be listening in yes no i'm sorry inspector living left here a few minutes ago uh can i give him a message in case he calls here first yes i see oh yes i'll tell him bye it was the hospital sydney talked to me told the whole story you're finished poor sydney i'm afraid he's dead again it's time for good didn't take long dude well i didn't see any point in hanging around i only had the one patient to visit anyone see it a few people i suppose buzzy i'm sure i told you well what do you expect i'm not invisible you know so they saw a priest at a hospital so what calm down buzzy i'm getting good and sick you're giving the orders around here now where is it written that you're the haunt show huh [ __ ] you want to be the honcho you're the honcho now why don't you just calm down get yourself a drink excuse me can't wait to get out of these clothes don't worry everything goes according to plan levine turns up here carts our friend and they're off to the booby hatch and by tonight you'll be defrocked oh buzzy we're getting so close to that money i can smell the serial numbers shame on you danny whatever happened to the honor system you know something he's getting to be one big pain in the neck let's kill him right now and get it over with that's not the plan and you know it is look the plan isn't chiseled in marvel it can be changed i'm changing it no no i'm giving the orders now you agreed levine is going to be here any minute and she's right i mean you can't if you kill me now they'll know you did it nonsense you're about to have a heart attack that's all just like your friend sydney what's that i'm an awful in reasonable doses it's given to heart patients in more exotic amounts it causes as they say in the trade severe vascular collapse in layman's terms mr corbin your dick is gonna blow out on the inside of your skin here we are i'm not a real clergyman as you might have suspected but if there's any comfort in it i'd be glad to say a few words for god's sakes just get it over with oh yes quite right right armor left mr corbin any preferences i think the side of the neck might be best oh there are only blanks in that gun you know there no now levine reloaded it before he left with real bullets fuzzy he's lying i was here the whole time they're still blanks now they're not so i'm warning you stay away get him buzzy stay away you shot him that's the way it goes hancho you knew they weren't blanks that's right but you told him thanks danny you saved me the trouble of having to split the money oh my god he's dead each picture thank god you got here all right coleman let's have it he's going to the library i want a statement come on you two mrs call me let's go holy call the wagon and stay with the body until the wagon gets you yes sir come on inspector it was self-defense they were they were trying to kill me and sydney was he trying to kill you too looked like he was going to make it and 10 minutes later when they came to take him to surgery he was dead just like that it was hard just to that that that was keller you see he left here before you did gave sydney an injection of some drug keller killed sidney yes inspector father kelleher was here with me the entire time they killed sydney and he tried to kill me with the same nail look at his pockets if you don't believe me oh mr corbin mr corbin what am i gonna do with you it's all too wild it's too fanciful it's too impossible every shred of evidence points to you every shred and what do you want me to do you want me to arrest her yeah inspector what is it he's dead who's that the priest yes fully we know no sir he wasn't he started talking all of a sudden but i got it all down the best i could what'd he say he said that he and this woman were involved in a plot to steal the real mrs corbin's money that he killed sydney and that they intended to kill mr corbin too then he died did you hear that did you hear that that's a deathbed statement to a police officer my god it's over it's finally over we've got her i've won what are you waiting for arrester what did you do so much for deathbed statements get his notebook we'll burn them when we get a chance what is it mr corbin where you come from all cops are honest i used to be honest 28 years on the force what have i got to show for it huh a pension that's worth less and less every day 9 000 bucks in a bank a dilapidated bungalow in one of the richest communities in america is that what you give your wife after nearly 30 years of getting shot at you knew all along not all along i knew something was fishy yesterday i found out father keller wasn't a priest here or anyplace else and that he and your new wifey had planned this for a long time long before you came along all those what-ifs last night they were true of course and when i threatened to tell a couple of other people about it they very generously cut me in not much million dollars in cash see i'm not a greedy man but now that buzzy's dead maybe our cut gets bigger huh probably even know where my wife is your wife she right here oh she's dead it must be you must be that's why that's why none of you is afraid she'd suddenly show up here has to be dead why's your whole plan it fall apart too bad you can't prove that mr corbin i don't need any proof that's where you're wrong you're a dead duck without proof no clues no witnesses you don't even know if there's a body let alone where it is no give it up mr corbin say goodbye to the nice people you got in the way that's all it wasn't your fault you just got in the way let's go it's inspector wait please i you want the money right you want elizabeth's money it doesn't mean anything to me anyway i'll i'll help you get it your chances will be a lot better with me helping you what do you got in mind just a minute wait a minute everybody's trying to change the plan and there's nothing wrong with it the way it was there's nothing wrong with a little i'll give you just 10 seconds to unlock these cuffs 10 seconds one false move i'll blow a hole right in your stomach you just stay put all right now i'll shoot anybody trying to follow me oh boy all right all right there's another door come on bert levine listen the looney got away in a speedboat yeah put on the points will you i don't want them to get out of the county (Dramatic Music) i'm sorry elizabeth once wasn't enough i i'm gonna have to do it all over again i kept counting on someone finding you by now but it's just as well they didn't see laureen's gun it's already killed two people so my accusations hold a lot more water it looks like it kills you too don't you see don't worry darling this time you want your thing forgive me elizabeth i won't bother you ever again oh you can't be alive you're dead i i kill you thanks mr corbin that's all we had to know oh let me go she's after me she's a lion he's dead dead is the day you killed him no i saw her move it wasn't her it wasn't her no that's not elizabeth you arranged the whole thing that's right mr corbin why did you do it didn't need our money i i did i i made some investment south american coffee futures it was supposed to rain all summer in brazil but it did it didn't rain it lost everything i had over 2 million elizabeth was my only hope she wouldn't give him the money huh she said she'd have no respect for him said i lose respect for myself said i'd even find a way to thank her something found a way all right i i kept kept waiting for someone to find her but normal i found three days ago looked like an accident too except for a couple of things why blood for instance what about it well she bled all over herself but not in the car meaning what meaning that either she was a very neat bleeder or maybe she was through bleeding before she was put in the cup maybe because of a single maybe you cooked up this whole thing oh no no no no i never go to this much trouble without at least two babies or was the other one contact lenses her driver's license said she had to wear them but she wasn't they were in her bag now why would a near-sighted person drive on a winding mountain road at night without a contact with us i never could tell even up close we still couldn't build a case against you we needed more we needed you to go back on your own all those people who were killed nobody else was killed mr corbin only a wife as you can see there's sydney minding the store who are all those others? fake elizabeth father keller that policeman you shot a few friends mr corbin just a few friends (Dramatic Music)
