With the support of Cinema Fund Alexander RODNIANSKY Sergei MELKUMOV present by Andrei ZVYAGINTSEV ELENA Get up. - Good morning. - Morning. If they don't look after themselves, they'll pile on weight and have lots of other illnesses to deal with. That's why you must take a good hard look at your lifestyle. Adjust your tastes. The easy way to eat healthily is to eat salads! Bon app?tit. The porridge is perfect. What have you got planned today? I've got to go and pick up my pension, then I'm going to see Sergei. He should be coming here. He needs the money, not you. It's not about the money. That's exactly what it's about. Why are you always traipsing over there? He should drag himself over here. He's a big boy. Just drop it. I don't tell you how to treat your daughter. It's dropped. - I hope you're not staying over. - No. Good morning. Hello. - Goodbye. - Thank you. Goodbye. Good afternoon! Today we've got a fine selection of glossy magazines for the lovely ladies, crosswords, adult magazines and today's papers. Just stop me as I come by. 1,425 roubles. Nadya! Come and take care of this. - Hello. - Hello. What is that shit? Let's go and have a beer. Is it your round? No. Is someone gonna get that? Sasha! Are you deaf? Alright already! Oh, Sasha. - Hi. - Hi. Where are you going? Put these in the kitchen. - Hi, Ma. Come on in. - Hey. You need a trim! Right. Here's the money. Thanks. Here he comes, here he comes! Oh, look who's here! Tanya, I brought some money. Thank you, Elena Anatolievna. Give it here. I can't see through you, woman. - Tanya, put the kettle on. - Yes. - Where are you off to? - Vitya needs his CDs. Your Vitya isn't going anywhere. - I'll just be a sec. - I know you mean by "a sec". He needs these CDs now. You two are going to wind up in prison or the army. I can't just sit here like an idiot. Then don't act like one. - Don't you care about your future? - OK, back off! I won't back off! Take out the rubbish. Whatever! - Whatever? - Nothing. - What did I say? - Nothing. Go and have a cup of tea with your grandmother. How am I supposed to talk to him? - I'm at my wits' end. - I'll talk to him. Coming, Dad. Can't get past this stupid level! Just a sec. Let me. - Dad! - Wait. Watch and learn. I'll be right back. Tanya, we're coming. Sergei. I'm talking to my son. Hold on. Go and talk with your mother. I said hold on. Ma, have you two discussed Sasha? No, but I will. What are you dragging it out for? We have to know if we're getting the money or not. You know how he feels about that sort of thing. He knows Sasha. They're even friends, sort of. We're family after all. He's a friend to everyone, but friends with no one. - He's just a tightass. - Come on, Sergei, stop it. If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't have what we do. And what is that, exactly? We can't let Sasha be drafted. We've got to know now if he's going to university or straight to Ossetia. Right, Tanya? More tea, Elena? Sasha, what time's football? Nine. We're quite worried. We need to make a deal with the right people at school and university. The 20th is the deadline. I'll talk to him, I promise. If you're watching this and you want to meet up and to talk, too, I'd be glad to, because I want you to know that I'm here. It looked like he didn't even try. It's pretty strange. It's not the first time. He seems disappointed, too. He chose to run like that! Then again, 9.8 sec... It is good, but it should have gone differently. I'm looking for my two brothers. My mother left my father in 1960, and I didn't know I had a dad until he wrote to me when I was 13. He said he had another family and that I had two brothers. I still haven't been able to find them. If they know I exist, they should get in touch. Finding them is my life's work. It's a typical Soviet strategy: pile on the pressure, hoping that he'll... Maybe he'll get there by the end of the season. He's already performing differently, but it's not showing in his results yet. Good morning. I read your note. Of course, I understand that Sasha... ...won't get in anywhere with his grades, will he? I'm afraid not. Why doesn't he serve in the army, then? It's the best school there is. Vladimir, you know what it's like in the army. Why am I supposed to support your son's family? Why should I be burdened with paying for someone's, effectively a stranger's, education? I live with you, not your relatives. You know how I feel about this. And your Sergei still hasn't returned the money he borrowed from me three years ago. I know. But you know about Sergei's current situation. I know your Sergei, and his "situation" is clear to me. Very clear. His whole life is one big "situation". It has been ever since he was born. I refuse to indulge him any more. Let this be a lesson to him. You don't force lessons like that on your daughter. And I'm sure you never have. Elena, we're talking about your son. It's like you're not listening. He needs to get his ass off the couch and find a job. Feed his family. If we were talking about the boy's health, God forbid, the money would be on the table tomorrow. But we are talking about his health. If you had a grandson, would you let him serve in the army? Sasha just needs help. Give him a chance. Leave my daughter out of this! Why did you bring her up? It's not my fault if she's the way she is. I did everything in my power. But she turned out like her mother. Only interested in enjoying herself. A goddamn hedonist. I don't know what that word means. You'd say "selfish". Vladimir, will you help Sasha? I don't know. I need to think about it. I hope you aren't taking money out on your credit card for them. I can account for every rouble. No, there's no need for that. I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry. I'm getting carried away. OK. When do they need the money? No later than the 20th. I'll give you my answer in a week. Make me another coffee, please. What have you got planned for today? House cleaning. I'm going to the gym. I know. Come on, you. Let's go, come on. Elena! Bring me my things. Coming. Good afternoon. Enjoy Fitness, Irina speaking. - Enjoy your workout. - Thank you. - Good afternoon. - Hello. Your towel. Anton! Put them down there. This is for you, this is for me. Here. - Thank you. - Thank you. Bye. Yes, speaking. Hello. Remember? This is how we met. Of course. What year was that? It'll be ten years in December. I would give everything... ...to wake up back then, ten years ago. And not here and now. That being said, appendicitis is still better than a heart attack. That was hardly appendicitis. More like peritonitis. You're a born nurse. Of course it was better! If only because you were looking after me. Although the girls here aren't bad. Keep it up and I'll cut off your oxygen! That'll teach you. You'd do it, too. - Did you talk to the doctor? - Not yet. All he does is try to reassure me by telling me they won't keep me in much longer. So it's not that bad. Or it could be the other way around. Elena, please call Katya. Yes, of course. Hello, Katya. This is Elena. Yes, hello. I'm sorry to say I have some bad news. Your dad's in hospital. He's had a heart attack. He wants to see you. You will come, won't you? I can't today. Tomorrow. Well, alright. I'd like to meet with you first to talk. Is that really necessary? Yes, I think it is. Fine. Where? Wherever's best for you. Hello, Elena Anatolievna. Hello, Katya. Do you want anything? I'll do without. What I wanted to say is this. Your dad had a heart attack... - I got that part. - He's very weak. - He's conscious, though? - Yes, thank God. He's probably groped his way through all the nurses already. Katya! Yes, Elena Anatolievna? I want to ask you to go easy on him. Right now, he needs rest. He needs your love. Show him that you love him. You see each other so rarely, which I don't understand at all. - But that's your business. - Indeed it is. Katya, you never call him. You should. Maybe this attack... It's the prodigal daughter's fault? In part, I'm sure that's true. Listen, Elena Anatolievna. You're playing the worried wife. You do it very well. Congratulations! So that's that. Have you finished? I love Vladimir. Till death do you part. I don't doubt it. Like a true nurse, you're trying to cure me. But I don't need your treatment. I am what I am. Tell me, are you not at all sorry for your father? I understand that that's... ...a rhetorical question, but I'll answer anyway. I don't give a flying fuck. Dear God! What room is he in? Maybe it's not such a good idea for you to see him today. Another time. When he's better... Then why did you call me yesterday rather than waiting until he's better? Your father asked me to. What room is Dad in? Hello. Could you tell me... Please cover your head in the house of the Lord. I wanted to ask which saint I should light a candle to. For someone who is deceased or ill? - My husband's in hospital. - A prayer for his health, then. Write his name on a slip of paper. The priest will pray for his health during the service. Place a candle in front of Saint Nicholas and the Mother of God. And while you're lighting it, ask the Lord for health and assistance. Could you tell me where those icons are? Straight ahead, to the right of the altar. Thank you. I barely see you, Katya. That's because the sun's in your eyes. I didn't mean it in that sense. There is no such thing as sense. Looking at you, sometimes I think that might even be true. It's a good thing you barely see me, then. I was never your reason for living. And thank God, you might say. You're wrong about that. Money, Dad, has always been your only reason for living. What are you doing? Making an inventory of my life? Money's important to you, too. Not that important. Maybe that's because you've never earned any yourself. Maybe that's because you spoilt me, gave me everything on a plate. That sounds like a complaint. You know I adore you. Keep it coming, please. I don't know why I do this. You don't know what you're paying for? No, what you make me pay for. You're priceless. You've always loved those word games. Games help children come to terms with the cruel laws of reality. Children? Nope. No. I'm not pregnant, if that's what you're asking. Too bad. It'd sort you out. I'm sorted. Alcohol and drugs at weekends only. It's all clean living now. I'm still getting sex and food under control. But I'm working on it, trust me. You're not smoking in here, right? - Why not? - It's a hospital, Katya. So what? You paid for a big suite. You can do whatever you like. Are you serious? Fine, I'll go and smoke where I'm allowed to. Hold on... What now? Where did you get this...? Where do you think? Genes, Dad, heritage. I'm a rotten seed. We're all bad seeds. Subhuman. Go and have some babies. Maybe they'll turn out different. Different from everyone else? There's no such thing as different. And I don't feel like experimenting with that kind of thing. It's painful, expensive. And pointless. With you, everything is pointless. You're making dumb excuses to avoid your responsibility. Dad, what's irresponsible is producing offspring you know will be sick and doomed, since the parents are sick and doomed themselves. And doing it only because everyone is doing it, because there's some "higher meaning" to it all, which is not ours to comprehend, since we're merely the ones who have to carry out this higher purpose. Shit must be tasty. Millions of flies can't be wrong. And the world will end soon, in case you haven't heard. You know, it's strange. But listening to you, I feel a lot better. See, that's exactly why you breed: to suck the life out of your children. Then you ask, "Where does all this come from?" You're such a twit sometimes! Thanks. I love you very much. Can we do without that? Come on! What one wouldn't do for money. See? Now, at last you're starting to see the point. Just don't lose sight of it yourself. What a pest! A pest? I thought it was a heart attack. Come, let me kiss you. Are you making a phone call? Are you phoning Mum? Go on, give her a ring. Come on. Let's go and see what's going on in the kitchen. Have a look outside. See if there are any sparrows about. It needs to boil some more. Where are those sparrows? Bless you. Above all, follow the medication schedule closely. Next, diet is critical. And take it easy. Don't do anything stressful. Nothing. I would recommend hiring a qualified caretaker. I worked in a hospital looking after patients for years. - Perfect. - See you around, doctor. You, too. Take care of yourself. All the best. Goodbye. I think we're seeing our refs... I'm not talking about today's refs. But all this talk about mistakes by referees, it's making them hedge their bets. If we filed away the tapes of this show and watched them in five years' time, the country would be shocked at the way it's all repeating itself. You'll pay for what you have done. You won't get away with it, either. But I wish you, our audience, all the best. Goodbye. Elena. I have something... ...I need to tell you. Your pills. Basically,... ...I've decided to write a will. I'm sorry, but this makes me really uncomfortable. Elena, this is important. I need to be straight with you. I think it's the right thing to do. Everyone's wondering what'll happen after I'm gone. No, it's not like that. All the same, we need to talk about it. Fair enough. Besides you and my daughter, I don't have anyone else in this world. After I die, my daughter will inherit almost everything. And you, as my spouse, will receive a life annuity. Monthly payments. I'm confident they will be more than enough. That's it, really. I've been building up to this for so long and I fired it out in ten seconds. Is there something... you want to say? Yes. There is. It's not about what you were saying, but it seems like the right time. What is it? - The other thing. - What thing? The thing with Sasha. I think that his father, your son, should be taking care of his own son. Vladimir... What were they thinking when they had him? It was an accident. Both times? Don't make me laugh. It's no laughing matter. It just happened, like it does to everybody. First one kid by accident, then another. And now I'm supposed to feed them? It's not the money that bothers me. Of course not. You give it all to your inconsiderate daughter. Here we go again! First of all, not all of it. And second of all, you don't know her. She's actually quite sensible. Inconsiderate and off the rails. I don't want to hear it. And apparently infertile, too. Nonsense. She's just different. She's not like you and me. Of course she's nothing like my son and his children! You said it. Dear God! What gives you the right? What? What right do you have to think you're special? Why? Just because you have more money? More things? All that can change. What can change, exactly? The last shall be first. Ah, I've heard that one before. Biblical fairy tales for the poor and the foolish. Equality and fraternity are only to be found in your kingdom of heaven, Elena. Well, you probably have a lot to do. Yes, quite a lot. Do you want anything? I only want to know that you understood me. I did. Elena, let's deal with this like adults. We are adults. We'll get through it. And I'm glad you understand. Can you please bring me a pen and paper? The lawyer is coming tomorrow, and I want to sketch out a draft of the will. Sergei, hi. Fine, thanks. Better, but still weak. Listen... I talked to him about Sasha. We'll have to deal with this ourselves. Yes, that's it. He says it's your job as a father to deal with the problem. Stop it. Stop, would you? I'm upset myself. But I think there's some truth in what he says. We'll figure it out ourselves. We'll think of something. I'll call later, OK? Shit. The tightass! Tanya! Where's my beer? Did you get the baby's formula? There was a damn bottle in here. Did you finish your homework? Yeah. Did you do your homework? Yes, I already did it! What a mess in here. It's all coming out wrong. I can't concentrate. Medicine first. Elena! I've had enough. Thanks. Do you want to take a nap? Think I will. I can't believe it. No one told you to abstain? It's strictly prohibited after a heart attack. I'm telling you, I didn't even know that he had it. Like little kids, I swear. Dumb teenagers have more sense. You could be a bit more tactful. How much more tactful? Dear relatives, friends and colleagues of the deceased, it is time to say farewell. Final farewells. Sausage No. 4 is the best, though it's too salty for me. I think the one closest to milk sausage is No. 4. My vote goes to No. 4. It's got a distinct sausage taste, unlike No. 3. we all have our own methods. The colour and taste of No. 3... I vote for No. 3. Please. Our jurors here are regular shoppers. They can only vote for one sausage. All of the labels have been covered up. I voted for No. 6. It was pretty edible. You can't taste the rusk, and there's no starch. It's an OK sausage. This one's too moist, too watery. Cook it a little more... It's a sign that it wasn't made right. A sausage just shouldn't be like that. The contest will continue in the laboratory, where the winner will be chosen. I liked No. 6. I can't figure out what No. 1 is made from. I'd never buy a sausage that looked like that. No. 5 is a waste of money. Don't spend your hard-earned money on something like that. It tastes like plastic! Thank you. I'll be right down. Hello. Well... Vladimir Ivanovitch knew that his death was approaching. I know how he wished to dispose of his property. I visited him at the hospital, at his request, and we discussed it. Unfortunately, we failed to document his wishes in writing as required by law. I am therefore forced to acknowledge the following. He did not leave a will, so the principle of legal succession comes into force. First of all, I would like to advise you that he left no debts. Otherwise, you would be liable to any creditors for his debts. Further, it is my duty to inform you that, under the law, should one spouse die, the surviving spouse is entitled to a portion of the property acquired during the marriage. That is, to their share of the common property. The spouse also inherits the portion of the property acquired during the marriage, on an equal basis with the other heirs. This portion is included in the inheritance along with the personal property of the deceased. However in this case, during the time that you were married, which was just over two years, no common property was acquired. Therefore, there can be no talk of a spousal share here. You will inherit a portion of the property of the deceased on an equal basis with Katya. Since, to the best of my knowledge, there are no other heirs besides the two of you, the entire estate will be equally divided between you. If anything is unclear, I can explain further. My father kept a sizeable amount of cash in his safe at home. What happens to that? I already checked. There's nothing. - Yeah, right! - Believe me, Katya. - Of course. Anything else? - We've only started. I've described the overall situation. Let's look at the details. If you like, we can take a break. No need, let's push on. - Right, Elena Anatolievna? - Yes, let's carry on. OK. Let's get started. So, how so we carve up Dad's pad? According to the law. Look! That's that. Mum... We should drink to this! I agree. - Have we got anything? - Of course we do. Well, come on then! Don't cry. Mum will be right back. You know what? Let's drink to Vladimir. He did at least one decent thing in his life. Let's drink to Sasha. Sasha! - What? - Don't you "what" me. Get in here. College boy. Sit down. Here. You're definitely going to college now. What the hell? What? I've got it under control. The kid's 17 already. What, is this real? Never seen so much, eh? Put it down. Damn! Alright! - To a new life. - Mum... We have a surprise for you! We're pregnant again! Are you serious? - Really? - Bless you. Goodness, that's wonderful! If it's a boy, I'll call him Vladimir. - Oh, please. - Why not? Well, I hope it's a girl. Yeah, a girl would be better! Here, eat. - Go easy! - Don't rain on my parade, woman! Game over. It's probably just the circuit breaker. Mum, you're going to break my arm. - Give him to me. - I'll go and have a look. Easy, little one, easy... Looks like the whole building's out. The whole world! Those assholes. - Hey, Alexei. - Hey. - What's up with it? - Fuck knows. The whole block's been cut off. I guess... They'll turn it back on. Assholes. They cut it off and we have to pay. Forget it, Sergei. Hi! Hey, you lot. - Where are you off to? - For a walk. Be home by 11. Tanya, have we got any candles? Why would we have candles? Vitya? Lesha? You there? Hey, guys. - What took you so long? - My grandma's on my case. Thought you'd chickened out. We almost went without you. - You should have, then. Shut it. - Chill out. Here, drink up. Hey, leave some for us. Are they there? - Yeah. - Let's go, then. Alright. Yuri, fucking hurry up! Slow down, fucker! Watch out! Kill him! Do him in! Die, fucker! Dima, let's go! How are you? - Mum! - Quiet. What do we need this crap for? If we put a wall in here, Sasha could have his own room. We haven't decided anything with Katya. We'll work something out. - I doubt it. - We will, I'm telling you. Ma, have we got any beer? Look in the fridge. I'm worried and I'm waiting for his decision. I think it doesn't matter whose prize you are. He's got qualities I like. He leads an interesting life, he's got kind eyes... Choose Katya or Dasha, there's no difference, whichever one takes your fancy. You will be a trophy! That was so cool. You were better than all of them. Don't listen to anyone. - Is he asleep? - Yes. Elena Anatolievna, this is amazing! Tea, anyone? Let me help you. Tanya, bring me some nuts. I feel like I'm 90 years old, and I want to grumble because you're all younger than me, except Leonid. I think that you're empty-headed bimbos. Keep it in perspective or you'll be sitting here until you're old enough to draw your pension. She wants a lot, but when it comes to giving... She doesn't know what she's going to give yet. Zhenya, what did you think of Lena? I don't know what to tell you. Basically, there's nothing I can say.
