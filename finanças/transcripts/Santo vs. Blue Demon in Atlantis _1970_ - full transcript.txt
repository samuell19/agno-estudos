Humanity's failing is that fatal instinct that leads man to be man's killer, that germ esconced in his soul called "Violence". The law of might is the atavistic cry that has lead mankind across the millennia towards slaughter and destruction in an orgy of crazed power. Attila, Genghis Khan, Hannibal and many more. And so, the story repeats itself for centuries and every time with greater cruelty. Desolation! Tragedy! Famine! Pestilence! Death! Allies of war, lethal instruments in the hands of beings drunk on power and domination. And so, on par with discoveries that exalt Man's nobility, new forms of destruction are perfected, to the point where from primitive lances and hand to hand combat, there are now monstrous scientific applications of annihilation. And the question remains, anguished like a presentiment of the apocalypse: "If with weapons not as powerful as we have today so much destruction was wrought what would happen of war surged once more?" Man is destroyed by knowledge. He has conquered the moon but has been unable to avoid the brutal and definitive threat of atomic war. With bombs capable of wiping an entire continent off the map, with guided projectiles that surge from the earth itself and from the aquatic depths and furthermore, attacks from outer space, using artificial sattelites and space travel for perverse ends. This, then, is the story of a criminal mind eager for dominance, Hugo Ulvrich, a man who has found the secret to subjugate the world or to blow it into a million pieces and eradicate all vestiges of humanity. Ready for takeoff. Begin launch countdown. Ten, nine, eight... Seven, six, five... four, three, two... one, zero! An unidentified object cross the space... Attention, emergency, emergency. Send aircraft to intercept the unidentified flying object at coordinates 479, repeat, 479. Caterpillar One to base, we're at coordinates 479. repeat, we're at coordinates 479, we lost the trail of the UFO. Breaking news: A rocket was launched today from an unidentified location. The United States, Russia and other world powers deny having made a launch in the last 72 hours. So who could have accomplished this feat? Base 8, Base 8, sensors indicate the objective on the path of descent. Attention all bases: prepare for landing on the moon. Attention Supreme Base, attention Supreme Base. Phase 3 complete, sensors indicate detonators and bombs in key areas. Remote control equipment ready, instruments ready, proceed with trial explosion. SANTO, THE MAN IN THE SILVER MASK VS BLUE DEMON IN ATLANTIS You, the representatives of the world's most powerful nations Have come to this secret meeting to try to avoid what could be the beginning of the third world war and with it the end of humanity. First, the launch of a rocket into outer space, then the detonation of a hydrogen bomb that destroyed an island in the Pacific ocean have created panic worlwide. All of you have declared under solemn oath that your countries were not responsible, therefore the Global Security Agency has taken charge of the matter. The eminent scientist Professor Gerard has come to the conclusion that the rocket was launched from a base to the south of the US and that the bomb came from outer space, launched from the moon. This leads us to suppose that we face a grave danger that could destroy us. We shall proceed with a global investigation at once. Aphrodite, initiate operation Ultimatum. International frequency, international frequency, attention. Interference in the normal channel, identify yourself. To all the nations of the world, this is Achilles. The explosion of the bomb in the Pacific ocean was a display of my power and a warning. If you do not follow my instructions I will destroy the planet. Within 10 days, all the nations of the globe will submit their governments and military forces to my command so that that a new era will begin, an era of a superior race with leaders who are mentally and physically perfect at whose command I, Achilles, will stand. This is the german nuclear physicist Hugo Ulvrich in 1940. He was 75 then. Change. He was one of the inventors of the V2 rocket that nearly destroyed London. In 1945 he was captured by the Russians to whom he gave information to regarding hydrogen and atomic bombs. Years later he fled to another country where his wife Renata awaited him. Ulvrich now would be nearly 100 years old and his wife 90 if the both still lived. And that's the question. Regardless, 6 months ago Ulvrich and his wife were spotted in Rio de Janeiro. How can you be sure it was the Ulvrichs? From the fingerprints that the Brazilian Ministry sent us. The astounding rejuvenation of that man is due perhaps to the fact that Hugo Ulvrich has learned to regenerate human cells. Hitler created the myth of the master race and Ulvrich was convinced that this was the Hellenic race. The ultimatum was given by Achilles, the most famous hero from Greek mythology. We can be sure Achilles and Hugo Ulvrich are one and the same. Do we have proof? Yes, we know where the ultimatum came from. That's incredible! To a nuclear physicist of Hugo Ulvrich's genius, everything is possible. In this report are the names of all the contacts in Mexico that will help you with whatever you need. What is my mission? Locate Achilles before the ultimatum is carried out: 10 days. - That's impossible! - No. We're counting on Professor Gerard. The professor has perfected a device that can intercept missles before they reach our atmosphere. To achieve this, he must be within the detonation zone. The team has already been moved to America and is under the supervision of the only agent that knows the identity of Professor Gerard. - Who is it? - X-21. - Anything else? - No, good luck. Thanks. Come in Professor Gerard. Did you hear my conversation with Pierre Duval? Yes, who is he? He's one of my most trusted men in the organization. Even so, its important that you maintain your identity a secret even from Duval. X-21 shall be the only one who knows who you are. X-21? Yes. He has already recieved instructions to help you in Hugo Ulvrich's fortress and to destroy it before he annihilates us all. Here are your instructions, memorize them and then destroy them. Any questions? No sir. You must leave immediately, an airplane has been made available for you, and during your voyage our radar apparatus' will keep a close watch on you. The Global Security Agency has initiated an attack to destroy me. I know Professor Gerard is in Mexico, he is the only one that could foil my plot. We must find out who he is and eliminate him. In a few days I will be the absolute sovereign of this planet populated by inferior beings. Soon my men will place Gaia devices around the world which will create electric force fields which I will operate by remote control. You, to destroy Gerard, must capture the agents of Global Security in this zone. Go and complete my orders! Respectable audience, finally our match is about to begin! The legendary Man in the Silver Mask, Santo against his equally famous challenger, Blue Demon! A match, best 2 out of 3 falls, without a time limit! Now you have the chance to become champion! Don't worry, I'll tear him to pieces. Water, give me some water. Stop. X-21? I'm Duval, from Global Security. What's happened to him? - He's been drugged. Who gave him this? - We did. I'll take the contents for analysis. Don't let these men leave. - I'll call an ambulance. - Yes sir. If this is what I suspect, we shouldn't leave Demon's side. What's important now is dealing with this case. It's urgent we contact Professor Gerard. Wait, where are you taking him? Hey, wait wait, where are you going? Why are you taking my car? - What's going on? - We're being followed. We can't lose that masked man. Proceed with your report. Blue Demon was captured. And the Man in the Silver Mask? What's happened to him? He pursued Blue Demon's captors. If hasn't been elimated by now he's probably found an important clue about Achilles' fortress. Listen well Duval, you must find Santo quickly. It's a life or death matter, I repeat, a life or death matter, over and out. Why so surprised? Am I so unattractive? Who are you and what are you doing here? Don't you think the question is a bit disingenious? How did you get into my apartment? Very easily. I slipped the porter a bill. Nothing can stop a woman when she's interested in a man. What's your game? It's simple: to be with you. I was right when I said Ulvrich had spies in Global Security. You're mistaken, I was just trying to protect you. She's an enemy agent, she was trying to get you to tell her who and where the Professor is so she could inform Ulvrich. Hold it! My orders are to capture you alive, but if you don't listen I'll have to kill you. Take me to Gerard. X-21 calling X-22, emergency call. X-22 here. Tomorrow we'll establish contact Point Code 3, it's urgent. Over. Guided by the immortal spirits of Zeus, Apollo, Hercules and Jupiter we will revive the splendor of the golden age of mankind to save it from the inferior beings that populate the world. Together, you and I my love, will be the creators of a new race to govern the world that I as sovereign will guide in the centuries to come. My deeds will be immortal, as is my secret to eternal youth. Achilles, Demon is in our control and waits in the Nuclear Room. You're a dangerous madman Ulvrich. Many such as you have caused grievous injuries to humanity under the pretext of trying to better it. You're here because you're an agent of Global Security. If the nations don't listen to me, I will create an atomic cataclysm. This underground fortress will keep us safe from the radiation. Juno! Observe. Observe well the ones chosen to live in my world, which shall be perfect! Men and women physically gifted. Intelligence and strength united to create a race of superior beings. Enough Juno. Don't you think its marvellous? Now look, every one of these lighted areas represent a zone where a hydrogen bomb will explode. The rest will be taken care of by radiation spread by ocean water. It will be a chain reaction. I'll show you what will happen. I will send my thoughts to you. The rivers will overflow. The earth will shake and the panic will be global. Are you convinced now of my power? Take him. We must capture the Man in the Silver Mask. I will bend him to my will. Remember that he is the only one that knows the identity of Professor Gerard. Make him talk, then kill him. What happened here? The elevator broke down, you have to take the stairs. Hold it Santo, don't resist! You'll have to come with us. Go up quick and let the elevator go! What's happening? Hold it! But, explain yourself, what are you looking for, what do you want? Explain yourself! X-21 to base, priority call. But, listen to me! Open secret channel. What are you looking for? X-21, secret channel open, proceed with your report. There are traitors in our organization, Blue Demon was kidnapped and I fear for his life. X-21, did you contact Professor Gerard? Yes, but I have doubts as to his identity. Give me more information. The professor had an emergency and managed to save himself with the temporary use of an artificial heart. Check to see if he has the scar of the operation. Positive confirmation on Professor Gerard's identity. X-21, let us speak to Professor Gerard. According to my latest figures I can say that Achilles' fortress is on the Pacific coast, that is all. Very well. X-21, it's your duty to find the exact location. Agent X-25 has been dispatched to Mexico to collaborate with you. She can be identified via the other half of the coin you bear. Over and out. I hope you'll excuse my rudeness, but I had to make sure. I understand. Our enemy is astute and he has unlimited resources. Now more than ever I must protect you from Hugo Ulvrich. I know you are a great athlete. You will face Theseus in a match to the death. Theseus, demonstrate your superiorty. You have demonstrated strength and valor, Demon. If I give you the honor of inviting you to my cause, will you swear loyalty? No! Take him to the Hypnosis Room. One last time: Will you become my ally? No! Listen Demon: You will forget who you are. You wil obey me. You will obey Achilles. You will only remember you are the mortal enemy of the Man in the Silver Mask. Blue Demon here, I managed to escape. I have information on Ulvrich. I'll wait for you on kilometer 35 of the international highway. No one must know, I'm being hunted. I managed to escape from Ulvrich and I know where to find him. I'll take you with me. Go, I'll follow you. Wait, they know your car, let's go in this one. Where are we going? Don't ask questions, trust me. Where is Professor Gerard? Gerard? What for? I know he's an agent of Global Security. Stop the car. I told you to stop! What's happened to you Demon? I am at Achilles' service, and prepared to die in his cause. Men like you and I were born to command and be obeyed. We'll enjoy wealth and power. Join us! Damned traitor! Look, we're being shot at! Who are you? - Pleased to meet you X-25 - Let's go, they might have reinforcements. Come in. We can be safe here until morning. Get comfortable while I make a drink. Let's see if there's some music. X-21 calling X-22, X-21 calling X-22. X-22 here. I've made contact with X-25. Instructions? X-25 will take you to Achilles' fortress. Report at once, over. Enjoying yourself? - Of course. It was a miracle you showed up on time. How did you find me? One of the subjects I passed with honors at the Global Security academy was locating contacts. Congratulations. To the pleasure of meeting you. To meeting each other. I'd heard so much about you I was eager to meet you. You know, its exhausting, our work. Never a moment of rest, of liberty, of love. Santo, I was thinking, if something were to happen to you... there'd be no way to find Gerard, then- Achilles would be free to do as he wants. It'd be convenient if you told me how to find him. Your mission is dangerous, and if something were to happen Achilles would achieve his goals. It'd also be good if I knew the professors identity. I'll tell you when the time is right. We have to go, it's dawn and the helicopter must be waiting for us. Global Security has captured several of Ulvrich's agents. From them we've learned the near exact location of Achilles' fortress. We know it is reached by an underwater cave, but we don't know the exact location. Santo, we're being attacked! It's Achilles' men! Shoot him, take the opportunity to kill him now! I can't. We were friends. Someones shooting us from the ground. Let's get away before they shoot us down. Hurry to the coast. We're over Achilles' zone according to Global Security. Descend. I'll look for a way to infiltrate Achilles' fortress while you pick up Professor Gerard. But how? I don't know him. This will identify you and you'll be able to find him. Return quickly with the professor. Very well. And remember that know one is to know who he is. - Take care of yourself Santo. - Good luck. I thought I had intelligent enemies. Did you think you would enter this fortress so easily? How stupid! No one, understand, no one reaches me without my authorization. Sir, Circe has just arrived. Let her in, let her in! My adorable Circe. Your orders were completed Achilles. I know, I know. You've done a magnificent job. Gerard won't be an obstacle to you, he's been located. Stupendous. You'll be well rewarded Circe. What do you say now Santo? I wouldn't be surprised now if the chief of Global Security is one of your thugs. No, no he isn't, but soon he'll be in my power and you will help me do that. You'll never achieve such a thing. I'm sure of it. Take him. You still have time to accept my proposition. You will be mighty if you ally with me. No. Today you will bring me Gerard, understand? No one and nothing will be able to stop you. You will do everything I order you to. Santo, were you successful? The device to intercept and destroy the bomb is ready. Did you discover the fortress? We can leave immediately. No Santo, don't do it! Listen Santo! Have you gone mad?!? He was an agent of Achilles' that tried to replace me. Hurry professor! We have little time! Achilles will make his bombs detonate worldwide! We can't do anything, he's destroyed it all! We can destroy the fortress if you help me. Here it is, the most terrible explosive known to man, but it must be placed in the fortress. Good, let's go now. It won't be so easy Santo. Professor, Achilles would be pleased to meet you. Demon, you know what to do, I'll take care of Gerard. What are you waiting for? If you don't eliminate Santo, I will! Hold it Demon, I don't want to kill you. Drop the weapon. Who is she? Juno, it was thanks to her I wasn't hypnotized and managed to escape. And how did you accomplish that? I reduced the electronic discharge without anyone noticing and when they left him alone I facilitated his escape. So Demon's one of them? No, Demon is acting on Achilles' behalf due to being hypnotized. Professor, can you snap him out of it? I'll try. Blue Demon's mind is strong, and will be able to readjust itself. Make him sit. In an hour the time frame I gave the nations of the world will be over. The bombs are ready to launch. Is there news on Circe and Blue Demon? None, but be assured they'll be back soon. Come with me. Follow me. What margin of time do you have before it goes off? No more than 10 minutes. Wait here. X-25, identify yourself! Sir, sir! An unidentified helicopter is flying in circles above us. Investigate, and if it doesn't identify itself, destroy it. What are you doing here, you know it's forbidden! Achilles was asking about you, where have you been? Answer! Something's happening! Everyone get ready! Lets hurry and get out of here before the bomb goes off! There's no way out of here, and the bomb will go off soon. Demon and I will distract them, you escape. Absolutely not. Do what I tell you Professor. You would certainly die. Exactly Professor Gerard, there is no escape for any of you. Capture them. Escape, I'll go help Santo. Hold it! Hurry! Launch the missiles immediately! There's no time left, it's us or them! What happened Achilles? I'll destroy half the world, they'll be sorry they didn't follow my orders! Careful! Are you alright? Yes, hurry and stop the launch! Escape, don't waste time... No, I can't follow you. Why did you help me? In the many years I have been following Ulvrich I have enjoyed eternal youth. At first, I saw him as the benefactor of humanity. Too late I realized the evil of his plans.. That's why I helped you eliminate Achilles and save the world from its destruction. Let's go Santo! This place will explode at any moment!
