Give up if you want to live! Impertinent wretch! I won! No one here can beat me now. I won! Open up! Open the gate! He's back! Kojiro! All that fuss, didn't you know I was back? Yes, I knew. Why didn't you welcome me?! Grinning! Am I? I'm sorry. You maimed Bunnoshin! He started it. He's my cousin! A good chance to test myself. The best swordsman, said he would cut me down to size. I thought I was lucky. Upstart! Think a nobody like you can succeed?! Kojiro doesn't think me his master! Father, you are too lenient! I told him that you grew up like brothers, so... But I'm the master! Like brothers, but he was a foundling! A bad example to others. Please tell him again! "Tone, Hyosuke's sister, is my only friend. "But she is engaged to Tomo loose.” Tell your brother I will be waiting at the Suwa pine! Why? You and he...? Nothing! Tell him that! Why are you here? Tell Hyosuke! Trying to save him? Or to lecture me? I didn't challenge him because he holds me in contempt! I can't stand his arrogance. I want to see how much a son of a good family can do. No! Please run anyway with me! Don't let me go! You look down on me too? Trying to save your brother? I made up my mind and came. I can't go home. I won't be a party to your whims! It isn't a whim. I'm on your side. That's what I hate! I don't want pity! I will find out for myself why I was born! You're too good to be buried here. I know that very well. What? Noble family, blue blood... I would leave so small a place. Renounce your family? You will leave your father, brother and Toma, your fiancee? We grew up like brother and sister. It's different now! You will come? Don't let me go! Open the gate! MY horse! Find them before it gets dark! Tone was seduced by Kojiro. She isn't a bad girl. I won't say anything. But... I regret it. He was my best friend. Toma! You join the search too! He took your fiancee! Hyosuke, give up the search. The village will laugh at us. You will let him take your future bride? My duty to my lord comes before personal matter. You won't fight him? I have my own ideas. I won't ask you then! It's a disgrace to my family. I will kill him! Clothes make the man? Yes. No one will treat you lightly now. Think so? I hadn't given it much thought. Nothing matters when you are famous. You will be judged now by how you look. Tone, don't leave me. No... You are my life. Please become famous. I know. Enemies surround me, but if I have you, I promise to become famous! I will start by challenging the Yamazaki School. Please win! I will! CHUJO STYLE YAMAZAKI FENCING SCHOOL Kojiro... You have so much confidence in your sword? I do not know. That is why I would like you to test me! I see. Lord Echigo is here from Kanazawa. Show him your conceited sword style. Kojiro, ready? Wait. We use short wooden swords. Not the long one. Shouldn't we use the one that will win? No! You trained at this school. A short one is the rule. No... I have my own style. Please test me with the style I challenge you. Defying our rules? The insolence! Wait! No. I will kill him to protect our Chujo style! Our Instructor will fight! No! Stop him! Perfect guard, but if I win, my life will change. That's all! It's ignoble, Shogen! Kojiro. Do you think you won? Yes! My sword caught his right arm! Be still! - You can see the wound! He could not have grasped his short sword then. Do you say I lost? Martial arts mean more. Thinking you won will cause you to suffer all your life. I do not understand. Please explain. Think you can live by your sword alone? I do not know. That is why I ask you. Find that out for yourself. Never mention this style as yours again. Is Kojiro here? He left. Turned away? He fought our Instructor. What? Who is it? A thief? I'm crestfallen to be called that. You've been stealing around here? You're the only one who's seen me. What now? What are you doing? Digging up something. There's a reward for catching me. A merit for you. Petty thief. No! Petty thief? How dare you shame me? Even thieves know shame? Wait! Toma! Stop! Why did you stop me? You came after me? I won't run! Fool! I knew and took Tone from you! I'm prepared to fight. Get off and fight! Kojiro! We studied at the same fencing school. Why didn't you tell me before our engagement? Drop such talk! Let's fight it out! It's sad you will be my first real adversary. Kojiro... Can you really make Tone happy? You promise? What? I meant to kill you to get Tone back. But not now? You think you will lose? No! Then why?! I'm sorry for her. My winning won't make her happy. Does she mean more than your life to you? Enough! Very well, you can have her. Leave here at once. Hyosuke is coming. Escape for Tone's sake. He's a fine man, but so are you. You're still here? My hobby is eavesdropping. A bad one. Kojiro, listen... Stay away, cockroach! I like that... Call me Kagemaru or Umazo. It's really Shimabei. I hate thieves! Don't follow me! What is it? Our Instructor committed suicide! Has anyone trained before with a girl? Am I in the way? No... I don't think it would be so pleasant. Trouble, I think, but be calm! It's Kojiro! Hold it! Men from the Yamazaki fencing school? I won fairly. There should be no grudge! We will avenge our Instructor's death! Fight! Lord Echigo's orders? We came of our own! Fight! Tone, stay away. My first real match. Watch me! Cowards! Men of fine families?! Kojiro! Tone! Tone! Kojiro! Hyosuke! Forgive me! Tone, please be safe. I promise to become famous. It is Iris first Trip. Not only that, everything will be new to him from now on. It makes him uneasy but also fills him with expectations. MARUME ICHIDEN RYU SCHOOL Do you have a recommendation? Recommendation? A recommendation is needed for matches here. What's this? - Traveling expenses. One cannot get along on ability alone. KYOTO The Yoshioka school he had counted on had folded up. You came to challenge the Yoshioka school? We're disappointed too. What happened? It seems there was a match with a certain Miyamoto Musashi. He beat both Instructor Yoshioka and his son. The end of a fine school. A pity. Too late. Too bad for you too. Would have paid us some money. Break your dreams? No, they have increased. New hope too. I would like to meet, Musashi. Musashi becomes Kojiro's new adversary. OSAKA SASAKI KOJIRO NO. 1 FENCING SCHOOL Food, woman? The nerve of you! Haven't paid your room and board and acting big! I know. I will pay some day. I'm tired of hearing those words! I'm too old to wait 10 or 20 years! Get out! I won't charge you until now! Get out! No. 1, my eye! Not one pupil, not even a cat came to train! When I become great, you'd become a beautiful legend. Don't regret it. Fool! I can't wait that long! Get out! Even a farmer's son of Owari built this castle. No. 1 school? Can't even cook rice with it! No good at all! Excuse me. Where is this man now? I wonder. Where'd he go? A fine place whoever owns it. I'll own one like this one day. Intruder! Don't move or you die! - Kojiro, wait. What? Who are you? Was it at Fukui that we met? I'm Shimabei. I didn't expect to see you here. Trying to escape? We can't seem to hit it off, since that day. Not with a thief. I'm different from an ordinary thief. I just want to watch the fuss. I return it then. How about it? I'm different? A bad hobby. What now? Turn me in? I will let you off. Hurry. Thanks. I never forget a debt. Found him! - Catch him! Then you say you are not that thief's accomplice? How many times must I say it? I got back what he stole! Without thanking me, you call me a thief! Excuse me if you are not his accomplice. Who cut the cord of the box? I cut it when I struck the thief! See what was inside? I didn't touch it! Sure? Save your breath! He picked them up! Shichidayu, were they all there? Nothing was stolen. Then let me go. You let the thief escape? Am I right? You thought it enough to recover what he stole? Why did you let him go? A man you know? Still suspicious? You said you slept out in the open. How about staying at my residence? I, Sorori, would like to thank you. Sorori? Lord Toyotomi's favorite, Sorori Bannai? Shichidayu, feed him. Make yourself at home here. If he saw the secret signatures, we must kill him. He must die anyway. But he defeated the Yamazaki Fencing school. Kill him while asleep? Not here. Check on him while he is off guard. Kill him inside Osaka castle? Even if we fail, he cannot get out. You finally found me? I heard Kojiro put up a sign. Where is he? He is not here. Not here? I last saw him at Mt. Ichijozan... Kojiro deserted you, didn't he? No, you are wrong. He did not. Then why? I gave you up to him! He's made you unhappy! I deserved it. But I am not unhappy. I am sorry about what I did to you, but I will follow him all my life. Fine. I will help you. I resent that. Hyosuke! I found her before you did. This is our place. So get out! You may think it's manly to help them. But a coward! You can't fight for your fiancee! I don't even want to talk to you! Get out! I will find and kill Kojiro! I will wipe out our disgrace! Kojiro is taken to Osaka castle as Sorori's attendant, a rare thing. Toyotomi Hideyori had been ill. Today all loyal Toyotomi men have come to rejoice over his recovery. In appreciation for their visit they are treated to Okuni's dance. What is it? Okuni is wonderful. Like a perfect sword. The sword again? I will show you the castle. Come. Osaka castle is huge, isn't it? Lord Hideyori's father's dream castle. The tower tiles are gold. Look at the magnificent Nishinomaru. Kojiro? Toma! How did you...? I'm with Chamberlain Shuri. Why did you abandon Tone?! I didn't! She is in Osaka. Where? Where? Where you had your school. She is there? So is her brother. Is Hyosuke alive? He says he will kill you. See her when he is away. He won't be back until 6. Later then... I'm Sorori's attendant! I see. Isn't it a lovely garden? I have seen enough. Can I leave at once? No, you can't. My master said to show you around. Kojiro, take a look. A very high stone wall. It's impregnable. Shichidayu, did you carry it out? Yes, without a slip. Even if we fail, he cannot get out of the castle. Tell me! What are you up to? Tell me! Shout and guards will arrest you! I've done nothing! If I say you checked the castle, it's a crime. I'm Sorori's attendant! Nonsense! He doesn't know you! Neither do I! You trapped me?! You can't escape! Your life ends here! What was that? What is it?! A madman! Arrest him! After him! An intruder! Find him? Over there! Hurry... You must not tarry in leaving. Please grant a samurai's most important wish and take me with you! No. Please! To see my loved one! Loved one? She means more to me than my own life! I can hardly refuse if it's for love. The 21 Okuni troupe members are leaving. Pass! You will offend others. Hurry. I hope your love bears fruit. Thank you! Please remember me. I am Sasaki Kojiro of Echizen! Farewell! I will steal your dance later. Steal my dance? A samurai is here with a girl? Yes, but he is not back. The girl is alone? Yes, but...! Tone! Tone! Yo Why are ygil he re?! Where is she? - What?! Why you...! - Tune! Where is she?! Tone! Tone, I will never let you go again! No! My brother will be back soon! Please escape! What? I came to save you! No...! You will be killed! Tone, trust my sword. I do... So do not fight my brother but become a famous swordsman. I can't leave you, fool! Only you believe in a nobody like me! I won't let you go. You said so too! He came? Kojiro, look at me! You made me like this! Catch him! Kojiro! I'm taking this man! Go! Damn...! MINAMIYA SAKAI HARBOR Like a dream. Why did you bring me here? It's safest here. Minamiya Jubei is a famous merchant in Sakai. He is rich, powerful and one of the Big 18. Why bring me? I never forget a debt. A thief's favor. - Now, don't say that. I've grown to like you very much. Stay here a while. I will find out about Tone. Please. Here, I'm known as Superintendent Yokata Shimabei. Understood? Please. Feel easier now? All cluttered up, but please feel at home. I have heard rumors of your famous name. Rumors? You defeated the Yamazaki Fencing school. Rumors reach Sakai harbor first. That song? An Okinawan song. Okinawan? Islands to the south, like a string of corals. She is a Princess from there. Princess? You two may become good companions. Pleased to meet you. Hard work, isn't it? Nachimaru the pirate buying weapons is nothing new in Sakai. I can't clamp down on business. But Nachimaru's gathering and hiding samurai. Then he's plotting something? Very well... I will keep an eye on him. You check thoroughly too. Islands to the south like a string of corals, like a dream. Come with me? Yes, to southern islands. It would make Tone sad? I've stirred memories? Perhaps fate will never unite us. But you love her? I don't know. Do I love Tone... or my sword? You cannot love two things equally. Hey! Very cozy! Pretty girl. Come with us. Just pour for us. Back off! You...! A strange skill. It's not. What? Protection. Protection? Yes. To keep men away. What is it? Tired? It's painful. That again? You earned my brother's hate because of me. You are too kind. I betrayed you. Even if we married, I couldn't make you happy. Think me your brother. If you were, it would not be so painful. He's a spy. When they die, they disfigure their faces so no one can identify them. No lives of their own. How terrible! Poor men. We need a pass here, so Hyosuke can't come. I will ask the Magistrate for a house. Sorori's back in Sakai? Suspicious? Yes, he sold his home in Osaka. Who bought it? The money? It's all suspicious. Before he returned, he sent 200 pieces of silver... to repair roads and bridges, he said. He donated to temples and shrines too. Old age may have made him do good deeds. I hope so. Not involved with Nachimaru? Why are you so restless? I've been here a month. Frankly, this place bores a swordsman. Jubei is trying to make you feel bored. I won't be young twice! I can't stand being bored! I would like to use all my powers against something! You have courage. Yes. I left home to test my powers! This city bottles up my courage! Why not use your skill? My skill? Your protection. To keep men away. Not against you. Do you know why? I know you will not do anything. If I am safe, I need not protect myself. You are very docile. My strategy worked. You took your hand away. That was strategy? Please, explain that. What you lack is reading people's minds. I hate things like that! Are you angry? Not you, but... Cut a person in two? Not a woman. Why? Because they are weak? Worthless? Stop goading me! You are fun. You are pure docile, a sheer joy to talk to you. Have it your way! Teasing again? The way I was teased. See here, your pass! Have you one? All right! Pass! Very strict, lately, aren't you? I hear you are gathering weapons and men, Nachimaru. Are you joking? I'm an honest seaman. Don't call me a pirate. Since you say it, you must be right. Does my returning to Sakai worry you so much? Officials always hope no trouble will happen. Hearing that makes me want to do something that you won't like. But I have no energy left now. I've grown very old. Kojiro! I have finally found you! I will kill you today! Get ready! Let me see Tone! Where is she? Toma took her and left! What? - She won't return! A lie! He gave her up for me! Toma fooled you! Fool! You don't know people! No! Toma is not like that! Enough! Wait! What's the matter, Kojiro? Praying? A devil's last moments? Hold it! This is a Spanish gun. Put away your spear or I will shoot! You are lucky, Kojiro! We will fight again, later! Did you think I would lose? I wouldn't! But I can't kill him! He's Tone's brother! Don't fight him if you are becoming Japan's foremost swordsman. Shimabei. How is it here? Did you find Tone? What? No, it's... Did you find her or not? I did find her but... Where is she? Forget about her, Kojiro. Women's minds change like autumn weather. What happened? Don't make me talk. She's with a man? It's Toma, isn't it? I don't know if it's Toma or not... If they are coming or may be here. I think you should go on alone instead of with a woman like her. Never mind... Forget it. As you say, I will go my way alone. How about a drink? Ican't. I will go look again. No, don't go! SEWING DONE I'm full, so I will go out. No time to rest? It's work. Even married, it would be like this. I couldn't make you happy. What is your work? I can't tell you. MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE Toma! Can you look me in the face? Where is Tone? Do you know him? No, a madman. Arrest him! Hyosuke, forgive me. I want to make Tone happy. You seem lonely. You do too. Take me to your land. Will you really go? Will you take me? Shimazu's going to attack your land. I will help you. No, I will work for you! You have Tone. She betrayed me! Me now? - No! Your mind sways like the rushes. If you were really concerned about us, I would take you. But in your case, it is not so. When you are lonely, you lose sight of yourself, making random remarks. Pure in mind and docile. I like you. But I hate you when you are selfish! I can break your chest with my hand! You know that. Teasing again? I do not wish to go. Then it's Kojiro. But I must go home. The ship is ready. We should leave before Shimazu's attack or it may be difficult to sail. Will you return and fight or remain as an ordinary person? It saddens me to be a Princess. It is sad. Princess... I am willing to stake my fortune to protect Okinawa. Jubei... Your name? Sasaki Kojiro. I thought so. Who are you? Horiuchi Mondo. Never heard of you. Nachimaru then. The pirate? Come with me. Have you made up your mind? You tried to kill me. Why? I want people with courage. Poison may be useful sometimes. What do you want? I want you to work for Toyotomi. Treason? No, something more interesting than that. I will give you 100 vassals. Use them any way you want to. I suppose you have ambitions to make a name for yourself. As the first step, it's suitable work. Sounds interesting. Will you do it? You can't refuse! Not for Toyotomi. It doesn't concern me! Silence, you fool! The reason doesn't matter. It's a dream that will change the whole aspect of Sakai. Don't tell me you are not interested. Be as violent as you like. Kill all you want. Then disappear at sea like the winds with Nachimaru. It's work that only you and Nachimaru can do. Trying to involve me in it? What if I refuse? Then you will die! I guess so. I don't expect to go out alive, but I'm just a pawn! I refuse! I want freedom! If you try to kill me, I will pierce you! Then Sorori's dream will fade! That's more fun for me! Nachimaru, put away your sword. Jinbei, return Kojiro's sword. A pity, since you have courage. But if it can't be done, that's that. Kojiro... Will you promise me you will forget all about our conversation? Will you swear you won't ruin my dream? I'm penniless. You can't do business. Change it for money. I like you. I won't cause you trouble. I see... I'm sorry. But I may not let you go. Do as you like. I have no home to go to. Your words make me happy. You may love someone... but forget her now. A fleeting love, won't it do? Fleeting love? Kojiro! Shimabei! SEN NO RIKYU 21ST MEMORIAL DAY I will go my way. What are you to me? Nothing. So don't meddle in my affairs. What's that? When I'm trying to tell you where Tone is! Stop it. You said to forget her. Well, yes. But I was mistaken. Stop it! It's not important now. Is it? Go inside! A rebellion has taken place! During the festival? A good time. That's Toma! He did it. You knew about it? Sorori's dream before he dies. Sorori? That isn't good. What? Jubei's in danger if it's true! The Princess too! Nami? Don't move! Nachimaru! Yes, I am! I will use this memorial service to show you a pirate style tea ceremony! Hurry! To Nansoji Temple! Hurry! It's Nansoji! Stop it! - Let me go! Don't get involved! Let's go! I must save Jubei and Nami! Thank you. Don't die. Farewell. Farewell. Hurry to Nansoji! Sasaki Kojiro of Echizen will take over here! Hurry to Nansoji! Jubei! Jubei! Jubei! Leave it to me and escape! Nachimaru. I knew it would come to this! Sosori's made you die with him? Kojiro... Don't die vainly like me. Hold on! If you are a samurai, cut off my head! I won't live in disgrace! Very well! Die like a man! Should we wait for Kojiro? OMORO MARU Nami! Jubei! Take me along! To the southern islands! Don't lose hope, Kojiro. Become Japan's best swordsman. It's my dream. If you think so much of me, leave me alone. Don't follow me! You are no friend, Sasaki Kojiro. Let's flip on it. Inside we part, outside, I follow. Kojiro's gone. still following him? Forgive me, but I... Lucky fellow, Kojiro. Where is he? That man? Yes, I'm sure he is. It must have been fate to have met here. Will you join us? Thank you, but... I feel you will fall into evil ways if we part. It is the road I have chosen! Let me alone! You have been through many hardships since? I have seen life's worst. Your love? It faded with everything else. I'm indebted to you but I may be killed any day. Too risky. If we let him go, he will become more desperate. Bring him back. I have no use for you now. You do. Have you forgotten? Forgotten what? You said you would be back to steal our star's dance. I heard you say it! You have no need to steal the dance now? Have you lost the will to do it? Don't argue! I may kill women and children now! You are weak. Your name? I am Man. With a grudge against the world, I almost became an outlaw. I might have used my sword for evil. But not now. I have new hope since joining you people. Your face us brighter now. Isn't that so, Man? I thought I had forgotten about quiet things. A good thing to remember. I do not know swords. But harmony between intensity and serenity makes out minds grow. It is the same with the arts. Man! Concentrate! Are you afraid of me? No. Man! Don't run away from me! I've almost found peace of mind... but if you distrust me... I will travel again. Where to? Far away. No, please do not go alone. Will you come with me? But... Why not? Because of Tone? No... Man... Do you dislike me? No. I love you from the bottom of my heart. But... But what? The star dancer... Man... Do you belong to the star dancer or to yourself? I do not know. Kojiro... Please do not let yourself like me. I have no heart to call my own. You cannot have her. Why not? It is not a passing fancy! If you agree... You do not think it's love? An unhappy love, so I forbade it. I cannot make her happy?! You said you would steal my dance, but was it only Man you wanted? She is my understudy, my dear daughter. No! It's only your excuse! If you love her, you wouldn't bind her! You don't love her, you love your art! Sacrificing her to keep your art alive! Kojiro... What grudge do you bear me to make me suffer so? I forbid it! She will not be happy! Ma'a mt! Man, you are not...? I am going! Please forgive me! Wait, Kojiro! Here again? A ninja may appear anywhere. You may want to be alone but I'm going too. Trouble if I don't go. Ran away with a girl? Escape! I have horses ready! I'm good at stealing! Hurry! Man, don't be afraid! Trust me! Let's go! Found them! Don't let them get away! Hurry! Don't die! We're searching for Sasaki Kojiro too. We don't know where he went since that night. It's too bad. We heard he did outstanding work. I had hoped to recommend him to Lord Hosokawa, my master. I caught you. Man, let go and you will die. I would die with you. Man, are you happy? Yes. I would like to live in these mountains forever. That's for old people. Man, let's go to Edo. Somehow, I feel there's great hope there. No, I would rather live here by ourselves like this. Not happy if I become the number one swordsman? There's happiness in the mountains. Become like that tree, unmoved by rain or storm. Not again? I've decided to live in the mountains. Is he afraid and ran away? No, he is a famous swordsman. It's past the hour. See a samurai dressed for traveling? A fight? Don't go! Pardon. Will you lend me your axe to chop off a branch? Please allow me. I will do it for you. Splendid. A fight? Good luck. Thanks. Don't go! Treat him, he may live! Stop the blood flow! Your name? I'm Sasaki Kojiro. Miyamoto Musashi. I thought so. We will probably fight one day. Please forget! Just beyond this pass. Will he consent? Of course. It's an honor to be the Fencing Instructor of Lord Hosokawa's clan. That's it! Now, I can win! Poor swallow! I will call it the Swallow style. It's unlucky to kill swallows! For our love too! What is it? You will go away! Not alone! Come with me. There are things to do. Man! Do you want to bury me from the world?! Even so, there is happiness! I want that kind of happiness... ours alone! So come with me. No, you have already left me! Nonsense! I won't let you go! Man! Wait! Where are you going? Let me go! Man! Man! Watch out! Man! Man! Why did you die? Man! Man! KOKURA CASTLE, BUZEN That's different. I don't know why he refused, but I will lose face if he doesn't agree. Yes, you are quite right. To become the Fencing Instructor of the mighty Hosokawa clan... I thought he would jump at the offer. He has matured since I last saw him. My lord is not great enough? No, not that. A year ago, he might have said a thing like that... but not now. Why then? I have greater hopes. I may fail, but I wish to become the best swordsman in Japan! Then accept the offer. The Chamberlain's buying the rumors about me, not my ability. Rumors and reputation aren't the real me. Don't be so modest. I'm not. I may even be better than my own reputation. Without confidence he couldn't have said it. I see. He's different from ordinary samurai. He's arrogant, but it pleases me. Nagaoka Sado. The Musashi you recommended said the same thing? Yes, my lord. Sado, where is Musashi? "A fencing match. "Time: On the 13th. 8 am. "Place: Funajima Island. "Contestants: Sasaki Kojiro vs Miyamoto Musashi.” Sir! Excuse me. The reward for the winner? I'm not sure. Our Fencing Instructor, rumors say. Instructor? Our lord's gift. A crimson coat of arms. And this is a Hosokawa heirloom. Use it on the day of the match. Thank you. But I will use this since I am used to it. Yes, but it's an important match. I think a famous sword is best. I don't want to rely on a sword. This has always been with me. I will use it. I would like to take a trip until the match. All right. A fine day. Taking trips suits us both. It's a good plan to travel until the match. But why not ride on your horse? You ride. I will walk. I see. Training your legs till then? Act's unconcerned but he is fighting Musashi in his mind. I know it. He's become a fine man. Become even finer. It's my dream. Shimabeli, you said to leave it to you. There's no road? Be calm. I am. I have strayed from the right path many times. All right. I will flip my hat again. Outside, advance, inside, turn back. What are you doing? Toma! Wait! No! I will tell Tone. She has waited so long. She will be glad. Stop making up stories! Wretch! I misjudged you! You said you would give up Tone to me! You are filthy! I'm Thomas, a friar now. I was a wretch. I said so, but I didn't want to give her up. I said I'd have you meet, but hoped you wouldn't. The merciless work of a spy made me a dual personality. But I have protected Tone until today. I suffered and confessed to God. My suffering is gone. I am not a samurai but a farmer now. If I offended you, do as you like with me. Toma! Tome is waiting for you. Go and see her. I made you suffer, Tone. I walked many roads. But I have finally found a way to live. I heard about you. I wanted to fly to your side. But I can't leave this place now. I am sorry for the sick and the children. I know. I'm happy we met before the match. I hope it will be a fine match. Yes, I'm sure it will go down in history. Please become more famous. That is my dream. You said that at the Fukui inn too? I am filled with hope. I know that. I will come for you afterward! I won't fail this time! Can I come in? Please. Some tea? Three days more. I feel like a contestant myself. Splendid. It seems alive. Just a hobby. No, better than professional work. I cannot outdo my sword, no matter how good it is. Shimabei? Hyosuke! Remember me? A former foundling but famous now. The more you succeed, the more I hate you. I have stalked you to wipe out our disgrace. I will kill you tonight! Wait! Wait! There is something very important! Musashi's match? I will break it up! I have lived only to kill you! My only hope is to take your head! Musashi won't get you! Wait, Hyosuke! Ours is an official match! You will be laughed at if you break it up! If you have a samurai's mercy, let me fight Musashi. If you don't mind being laughed at, we will have it out now. How about it? Kojiro, you have learned some sense. I will wait until 6 PM on the day of the match. At Tokiwa bridge. All right! Be sure to win, Kojiro! He's coming! Please let me see him! I will pray for you. Tone said so too. Toma, I want you to watch the match today. Come to Funajima island with me? I'm not a samurai any more. That's why. A great occasion for me. Watch in Tone's place. FUNAJIMA ISLAND Where's Musashi? Sado. What? It's time for the match. I know it! Hurry! Find Musashi! Very pretty. What are they called? Beach wheels. Very many here. They only bloom here? The place of the match. Isn't Musashi here yet?! Two hours late. The game has been settled. Naizen! It's late. Musashi lost. Leaving?! It depends on Kojiro. Thank you today. Kojiro, we are the Inspectors. As you know, Musashi is not here. Will you leave? You have the right to. How about it? Even if you leave, you have won, of course. Think and decide. Think well. I will wait for Musashi. A splendid decision! But... Musashi will come without fail! Why don't you leave? You've no confidence in me? Yes, but you have won already. What? Waiting so long means you have confidence. You have won! Only ability wins! I won't be laughed at! Kojiro, you...! I told Tone it would be a fine match. She wanted it that way too. So I will wait for Musashi. Musashi is coming! He's coming! Kojiro was a fine man.
