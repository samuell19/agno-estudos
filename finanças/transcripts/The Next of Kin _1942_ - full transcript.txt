- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes What has happened? The Germans have begun to use our harbor as a base for submarines. - Since when? - Last week. The people are furious, but they can do nothing. - How many troops have they here? - Only a few. - A battalion? - Perhaps a battalion... Well, we shall know in a minute if he's got anything. And if he has... - Captain Mercier. - Show him in. Will you come this way, please? Come in, Captain Mercier. How do you do? - How do you do? - Well. - Any luck? - I think I have the information you required. Here is my full report on the German coastal defenses in northern and western France. - Splendid. - Won't you sit down. Anything special? The Germans have begun to use Norville as a base de sous-marins. Submarine base? Norville. Where are we... Oh, here, Norville. - But that's only a village. - But it has a good harbor. This is the one. - Norville. - How strong are the defenses there? There is only one battalion of troops in the town and a few naval technicians. I see. And the coast? It is very thinly held for 50 miles on either side of the town. There are no tanks, no heavy guns. In fact there is no substantial body of troops within 80 miles. No troops within 80 miles? Lord, for an important base it's very lightly held. Yes, but probably with the hope that it won't attract our attention. Well, thank you very much, Capt. Mercier. We're extremely grateful. At your service. - Good bye, sir. - We'll keep in touch. That settles it. Norville! If we can put pegs on that German base there, that ought to make those shipping figures take a turn for the better. - How many men shall we need? - A brigade group should be enough. Right, I'll put that up to the Chiefs of Staff at once. If they agree, we can get the men off at night and land them at dawn... ...on these beaches and somewhere here. Then they could make their way around, knock off the Boche battalion... ...and hold the place while the sappers blow up the stores, oil dumps, lock gates, everything else there. The whole show should take... how long, 12 hours? Good, that means we get them off again that night. The 95th Brigade is standing by, they're fully trained. We can send them up to the new training area at Watercombe... ...and put them through their final rehearsal. There shouldn't be any difficulty in getting them down to the Channel. Then we can stuff them into a convoy going to the Near-East. And when the time comes they can break away with a destroyer escort. But if the Boche got on to this, it will be good bye to the brigade. What we need is a full-time security officer on this job to ensure secrecy. Richards would be the man for it. I'll see if they'll let us have him. Hello? Richards, we want you to cover the 95th Brigade for security. - What are you going to do with them, sir? - We're sending them up to Watercombe... ...to do special training to go out on a special job. - Watercombe? That's near Westport, isn't it? - Hmm. - Who's the Brigadier? Blunt, a grand fellow. Brigade Headquarters at Newby. I'd better go and contact him right away. I suppose you can't give me any sort of idea what kind of a job it is I'm going to do. - We're planning a raid. - And we don't want it to be a suicide squad. Can you tell me where Brigade Headquarters are? Yes, sir. Up the hill, first to the right, follow the road around. Ah, here's the Brigadier's car, sir, you might as well follow him. Nice friendly people, tell you anything you want to know. Always will, sir. Yes, I'm afraid we shall have a few headaches on this job before we're through. I always thought if I wanted a nice cushy job I'd come to England as a German spy. - Do you know who I am? - No, sir. Well, then oughtn't you to ask for my pass? - I thought you was with the Brigadier, sir. - Well, I'm not. I might be an enemy agent for all you know. - May I come in, my name is Richards. - All right. - You're the security man, aren't you? - Yes, that's right. - We were expecting you, my name's Harcource. - How do you do? This is Johnston, our Intelligence officer. - How do you do? - How do you do? You'd better see the Brigadier right away, he'll be free in a minute. Good. By the way, I just ticked off that sentry of yours just now. He never asked me for my pass. He doesn't know me from Adam. I hope you don't mind. Oh, not at all, he ought to have known better. I'll talk to his CO. - 10th Chilton, isn't he? - Yes, Cooper's his CO. Just take this stuff back to the CO, Cummings. Tell him I'll come around in the morning and discuss it with him. - Right, sir. - All right, gentlemen. Oh, um... not that one. Just listen to this. Oh, this is Richards, sir, the Security man. How do you do, Richards, I'm glad to see you. As a matter of fact this is something in your line. "Dear sir, I understand that you're moving from Newby to Watercombe. May I point out that we have a branch near there at Westport, as well as at Newby. We shall be pleased to carry out any orders you may be good enough..." and so on. A wine merchant. Now how the devil did he find out? The men know nothing of it, I'm certain of that, sir. What do you think, Richards? I wonder, sir, if it was mentioned in the mess. You mean the mess corporal might have heard. Anyway, just check up on it. There must be a leaking somewhere. Good, come along, Richards. By the way, you might tell the battalions they're getting seven days' leave. Tell them to work out their own spreadover. - Does that mean, sir... - It means just seven days' leave. I'm afraid you're going to find me an awful ruddy nuisance. Seven days' leave. Perhaps that means we're going overseas at last. As you see, our security certainly needs tightening up. Of course we're going to Watercombe as you probably know. But we want the men to think they're going out East. The leave was a blind. We're even going to issue them tropical equipment. - Sit down. - Thank you, sir. Now, is there anything else we can do? Well, sir, the important thing is security in the initial stages. Once the enemy gets to know there's something on, it's fairly easy for them to find out what it is. You're right. I'll talk to the officers and then COs before the leave starts. And I suggest, sir, that you begin censorship right away. Post and telegraph. The men oughtn't to be allowed to use letterboxes or post offices. We can put that into operation today. You know, I'm looking forward to this show, Richards. It's come just in time to prevent any chances of the brigade getting stale. You'd better start in right away and let me know where you think we're weakest. - Blimey! - Too skinny for me. Go on, there's no pleasing some people. What do you think, Johnny? Hm? Come along, kid, come and drown your sorrows. - Come on, Johnny. - No, not him. He's dreaming of my darling Lorelei. - Good evening, Billy. - Good evening, sir. Come in, darling. Who is it? Oh, hello, Tommy darling, come on in, have a drink. - Hello, Ma. - Good evening. Well, I wanted to come around and see you before the end of the show. Before all the others come barging in. - Possibly my last chance. - Your last? Oh, damn, that's the end of the whisky. Ma, be a love and run through the back way to the Bull and get me a refill. All right, dear. Oh, here, let me pay for it. What do you mean last chance? I've got another week here yet. Well, I know you have, but I haven't. Oh, don't tell me that awful old War Office is moving you. I'm afraid so. Oh, but darling, but why do they have to pick on you? Why, it's not only me, it's the whole brigade. Oh, hell! Guy, you had a lovely time in there, I say! He loved every minute of it, I could see his face. Hello, Ma! How's Your Ladyship? Oh, giving the drinks to that little twirp, as usual. Just because his father's got 25,000 a year... - Hey, miss, I'm in a hurry. - I'm serving, can't you see? - I do get sick of my job sometimes. - I wouldn't mind it. Too skinny. Don't worry about him, Ma, he's a bit browned off. - So would you ruddy would be. - What's the matter with him? - No leave, going back to the depot. - Why? - His legs. - What's the matter with his legs? Well, you see, Ma, the brigade's going overseas. At least it looks like it. We've all been given leave. And the Army's not so bloody generous as to give the old brigade leave... ...if he ain't going to do something bloody horrible to them after this. He's got bad knees so he don't go overseas and he don't get no leave. Oh, rough luck! Oh, come on, I can't wait here all night! You know, it's going to be terrible not seeing you again. They're not sending you anywhere dangerous, are they? - I don't know, darling, I have no idea. - You're not going overseas right away? As a matter of fact, no. Now look here, for God's sake don't tell anyone, but I rather believe we're going to do some sort of special training first. Well, where will you be then? Well, that I'm afraid I can't tell you because it's hush-hush. Oh, what a shame. You see, I'm doing a show at the end of next week. Doing that solo in Variety. I might have got a date near where you're going to be. Do you mean you really would? Look, you don't have to tell me any of your precious military secrets... ...because I'm a German spy. But there are my provincial dates. If you're going to be near any one of those, maybe... - I say! - Ah, ah, careful! Oh, don't be an ass, darling. Look, you couldn't make Westport a week or two earlier, could you? Westport? I might. I'll try and fix it with my manager. Well, that's fine, because if you could be at Westport... ...when the brigade's training at Watercombe, what could be better? Here you are, dear. Such a job to get it, too. Just in time. Well, we must drink to our last meeting, mustn't we? - Oh, that's all right, Ma, you can keep that. Oh, thank you, sir. You'd better get changed, you're on in a few minutes. All right, Ma! - Well, here's to au revoir. - Cheers. - Come on, come on, come on. - Now then, darling, I should go. Okay. Well, with any luck I'll see you at... Ma's a German spy too, you know. - Good night. - Good night. Well? Did he tell you anything? - They're moving. - I know that. - They're going overseas. - I know that too. Seems I've been wasting my time. The men don't know when they're going, only the officers know that. Funny, he didn't mention it. Oh, yes he did. Come on. Oh, I'm sick and tired of the whole lousy racket. - Do your own dirty work for a change! - Listen here... - You bitch! - All right. This is where we part. And I hope you can get your coke ration from somehere else. I'll give it up, it's only a habit anyway. Oh, no, me girl, that kind of habit you can't give up. I've tried, and I know. Tata, pleasant dreams and a couple of aspirins. Wait a minute. They're not going overseas yet. They're going to Watercombe for special training. - Are you sure of that? - Yes. I told him I'll try to make Westport a couple of weeks earlier... ...so as I could go over and see him. - Some hopes he's got. - I don't know so much. - Your call, Miss Clare. - Coming! Have I got everything? Wherever you may be, in pubs or buses, or in the car when somone gives you a lift, or even chatting with friends and relatives, take it for granted... that everyone you meet may deliberately or unconsciously... ...give you away to the other side. Now, you all know what a traitor is. A traitor is a man who deliberately gives away his side to the enemy. Put a patriot can easily do as much harm as a traitor. He can do it by letting slip some unimportant tupenny ha'penny detail... ...that may have no value in itself whatever. But that detail may be the one clue... ...that gives a meaning to several others details equally small. Together those details may make sense. They may reveal to the enemy that some big move is on. So think twice before talking about military affairs. When in doubt, say nothing, even if saying nothing makes you look a fool. Every time you positively check yourself, you're helping to win the war. That's what I want to ram home to every man jack of you. Bear it in mind all the time you're on leave, and after. Drum it into your men. Tell them anything they say may get back to Germany. I don't say it always will... but it may. Gentlemen, we have your reports from the Auslands Bureau on its work Brazil. A similar report from Mexico, and another from Afghanistan. All this is good, gentlemen, as far as it goes. But what I want is new facts. No matter how small. From small facts there often spring big ideas. Come. Yes, Horn? Excellency, I've just received a radio report from England that the 95th Brigade... ...is proceeding to a new training area at Watercombe before going overseas. Watercombe, where is that? Ah, near Westport. That is where the big convoys start from. Very interesting. - What do we know about the 95th Brigade? - It is a normal brigade, Excellency. Commander: Brigadier Blunt, an efficient soldier with a distinguished record... ...against us in the last war. And new personnel has been posted to the brigade. Ah, and now Watercombe. You see, gentlemen, a new fact. Well done, Horn. It may mean nothing. On the other hand... Who have we working for us at Watercombe? No one, Excellency. Our men are all engaged in watching convoys at Westport. But our woman agent reports she is following up the information. We cannot rely on that. Someone must be sent immediately. Send two men. We must have details of equipment as well as of the type of training. There are some good men working on the refresher course this moment. - This is number 23, Herr Oberleutnant. - Number 23, you know England well? I was in business in the north of England for ten years until shortly before the war. Good. So you have the complete English outfit. Here are your papers. You'll be landed by rubber boat from one of our u-boats... ...at some port of the English coast. You will then find your way to Mr. Barratt, our agent, a bookseller in Westport. He will give you further instructions. Meanwhile, study those and await your sailing orders. That's all. This is number 16, Her Oberleutnant. Number 16, you will travel to England by air and land by parachute after dark. I understand you know England well? - I was a clerk at oil contractor's. - Here are your papers. - Good bye, Jim, take care of yourself. - Okay, Ethel, I will. And try and get another leave soon, Jim. Seven days goes awful quick. Don't you worry, I'll be back before you know where you are. But when? How do I know? I'm not a blinking general yet, you know. Good bye, honey. Now take care of yourself, I'll be back soon. This is the worst of the ruddy army. You never know what they're going to do with you next. You can't even tell your missus where you're going overseas. You're telling us all now, aren't you, chum? You never know who may be listening. What are you butting in for, I wasn't talking to you. Knock it, Jimmy, you'd better go and sleep this lot off. Thank you, pal. Is he one of your lot? Yes, but he doesn't know what some of us know. I've got a pal who's mess corporal at the gate headquarters. He says we may not go overseas at all. Not yet anyhow. We're going to move up to Watercombe, more special training. That's funny, we're going to Watercombe too. - What are you in? - Troop ships. You know, same as they used in the Lofoten raids. - Were you on that? - What, now he's talking? Now he's talk... If you had been on that ship, you'd been met by the whole German Army. Here, here, pull yourself together, Jimmy. Pull yourself together. Talk about broadcasting. Ought to be on the wireless some of them. - That's right. What's yours? - Oh, don't mind if I do. - Brano? - Hm-hmm. Two Brano, please. - Are you on leave, old chap? - That's right. - What unit? - 10th Chilton. - Oh, I know, the 95th, aren't they? - That's right. - What company, old man? - Headquarters. - Been with them long? - Since November 1939. That's funny. I've been with the headquarters company in 10th Chilton's over six months... Never seen him before. - Who was the CO? - You're ruddy suspicious, ain't you? - Go on, who is he? - A chap called Cooper. Well, that's right enough. Ah, you was out in France with him. - When he won the MC. - That's right. Only it wasn't an MC, it was a DSO, wasn't it? What's the matter, old chap? You absent without leave? Of course not, he's just ruddy nosy, that's all. Oh, so would you be. If you'd had seven days debriefing for getting the right man right, Lord knows what would happen to me if I got the wrong man wrong. Well, so long, chaps. DSO... That bloke was never in my company. Excuse me, sir, could I have a word with you? - What do you want? - There's a chap in the buffet bar... ...says he's in the 10th Chilton's. And he ain't. - How do you know? - Cause I'm in the 10th Chilton's, sir. - Do you know everybody in the battalion? - No, sir. But he says he's in the headquarters company... ...and that's my company, I've never seen him before. - Well, who do you think he is? - Well, I don't know, sir. But he might be a German spy. A German... a German spy? How do you imagine he got here? Well, I couldn't say, sir. But the papers say there's been some parachutes come down. - All right, fetch him in. - Very good, sir. What are you going to do about it? The fellow's probably tight. I must do something. And if these fellows make a report, we must follow it up. Otherwise they won't report anything. You don't really think he is a parachutist, do you? I should think it's extremely unlikely, but we can easily find out. If you're on the level, you've got nothing to worry about. - Here he is, sir. - All right, come in. Go on, get in! Let me see your Pay Book. Sir. - What is your regiment? - 10th battalion, Chilton, sir. - Where are you stationed? - Newby. - And before that? - Tidworth, sir. No, sir, we was in Norwich till March. He doesn't know what he's talking about, sir. Well, we'll soon see about that. Close the door. - Take off your blouse. - Who me, sir? - Yes, you. - Very well, sir. - There you are, sir. - Now your shirt. My shirt, sir? Yes, your shirt. And don't try to be funny. Now your vest. Take off your vest! Look, sir! Parachute harness marks. He must have landed within the last 24 hours. I'll be damned! Well, that's a good piece of work, er... what's your name? - Durnford, sir. - It's a good piece of work, Durnford. Now, will you collect an escort and we'll hand this man over... ...to the first military headquarters we come to. Very good, sir. Escort! More ruddy fatigues. Serves me right for poking me blinking nose in. Excuse me, sir. Could you tell me if I'm on the right road for Westport? Sure, you turn left here. Are you going my way, would you care for a lift? That's very kind of you, I thought of catching the bus at the crossroads. You should have checked up on me before telling me the way like that. For all you know I might be a German spy or something. - Good morning, sir. - I want to see the proprietor. I have a book here which I'm anxious to sell. Just a moment, please. There is a gentleman outside, Mr. Barratt. He wants you to buy this book. Hm, yes, very interesting. Ask him to wait a moment, will you? - Mr. Barratt will not be long. - Thank you. Yes, a most interesting book, sir. I think I've got a client who might like to buy it. Will you come inside? - By the way, I don't know your name. - Davis. My papers are all in order. I understood I should get all further instructions from you. Yes, that's right. Sit down, will you? - Sit down. - Thank you. - Cigarette? - Thank you. You're lucky. - No, thanks, no. - Oh, go on. Thank you. - That girl of yours, she isn't English? - No, she's a Dutch refugee. You know, Westport has always known me as an anti-nazi. So has she for that matter. A very useful cover. If she should get to know anything, her parents are in Rotterdam. The Gestapo can always take them under its protection. Now to business. You'll go to Watercombe, a little place down the coast here. You'll stay at the Whitehart Hotel. I've booked a room there for you. - In the name of Davis? - Yes. The 95th Brigade is expected in Watercombe in about three days' time. You will be comfortably settled in before they arrive. If I want anything urgently, what shall I do? You ring this number: Westport 77250. Ask for Ned, that'll be me. Talk about family affairs. What identity papers have you brought with you? I've got them here. Ration book, identity card, driving license, passport. God, our people are thorough. Every detail just as I sent it over. You should be all right with those. The safest alibi we could find for you. Can you tell me a little more about Mr. Davis? - He's dead. - Oh. This is the parish magazine of St. Barnabus Rockly Park, Cardiff. "Among those whose death must be presumed through enemy action is Mr. Arthur Davis" Mr. Davis was 46... ...and was for many years one of the managers in Linet and Linet Metal Tube Workers. - "He was unmarried." - I see. You're not a very distinguished citizen. You can embroider your past as much as you like. I recommend you to say as little as possible. You automatically attract sympathy through having been bombed out. You've had a narrow shave. Pardon me, have you a copy of Mein Kampf? John! How wonderful! I thought you did go back, did you miss your train? Couldn't have known it was coming, it didn't wait. What will you do now? Get the next one on the three-day CB, I expect. I say, oughtn't you to, um... She's reading Gone with the Wind. A chapter at a time. And I shall have to be gone with the wind too if I don't want to miss the next one. - Write to me before you sail. - Of course. And send me your address as soon as you get there. I promised you all that last night. Besides, you know, you people here aren't exactly outside the war zone. - I will write, you know I will. - You'd better. - Are you taking that book, madam? - Oh, what ever came over me? I don't want it at all. Anything wrong, Miss Leemans? A customer seemed to think our books were free. Some fetch quite high prices, don't they, Mr. Davis? - Good day to you, sir. - Good day. - Good bye, Beppie. - Good bye. So the army of occupation has arrived, Mrs. Taylor. Good for business, eh? Good day. Not much use with supplies cut down as they are. Still we're luckier than some places. This is the first lot of soldiers we've had. I suppose you're having some of the officers billeted here? No, they're all going into camp. Excuse me, madam. - Gosh, what a bit of luck! - I'd still rather Margate. What's the matter, Johnny, does she live here? Westport. ten miles away. Might as well be a thousand, you'll never be allowed to see her. Boys, we are now passing the oldest public house in Great Britain. Why? - Hello, what are you doing here? - Just watching the troops. - Don't you know this is a prohibited area? - Is it? I'm so sorry. It doesn't say so. Still, I quite understand. I beg your pardon - A hun, isn't it? - Reconnaissance. Possibly. Well, they've chased them away, anyhow. That's odd. I gather a Jerry hasn't been in this part of the world for months. If they have any reason to suppose... - Still, I hope I'm wrong. - I hope you are, sir. - How do you spell Jenkins, Johnny? - You ought to know that by now. Thanks for nothing. Well, it's going to be nice seeing how you're doing it... ...when you got to post your love letters in an army post box. Hasn't a man got no private life these days? You don't look well this morning. Would you prefer to go home? - I'm all right, it is nothing. - Is it your parents? I've tried and tried to get a word from them... Miss Leemans... I'm so sorry, I'm afraid I opened this by mistake. - From the boyfriend? - Yes. He wants me to go and spend the Sunday with him. - Oh, so he hasn't gone abroad after all. - No. Well, it's well timed, you needed something to cheer you up, didn't you? Number 23 reports that the troops exercising at Watercombe... ...have rope-soled shoes, grappling irons, ladders, pulleys and other tackle. Sounds like a cliff landing. There is no evidence of their having any new methods... ...of exploding land mines. Well, why the devil should they? If they were planning a surprise raid, they would hardly wish... ...to begin it by exploding mines. This is good, as far as it goes. But we must have more detail. Number 16 has not yet reported to our chief agent at Westport or anywhere else. - I'm afraid he may have been caught. - Then our agent at Westport... ...must make other arrangements. Very good, Excellency. We might also use the report of that woman at Watercombe. Certainly. There are signs that the enemy is becoming interested in Watercombe. That reconnaissance plane, for instance. I'm quite certain they didn't come over by accident. The Boches got information about this place and we've got to stop them getting any more. And you've got to help me stop it. Remember the enemy has highly trained agents. They may be in any walk of life. Grocers, pubkeepers, barbers, politicians. People whom the enemy's bribed or blackmailed Even people who admire nazism so much... ...that they're ready to betray their own country for it. Watch out for these people all the time. Do you mean you want us to report everyone... ...who asks us questions about what we're doing? I do. I know we have professional security services functioning in this country, field security, police an so on. And I think they're efficient. But they can do little without your help. You are the people who can stop the enemy getting that vital information that he wants. You are the real security men. Anything new? Yes, sir, there are one or two things. An officer's lost a map. Yes. And there are three cases of flashing lights. - There always are, better investigate them. - Yes, sir. Oh, and three soldiers came in. They said that, um... last night a man at the Whitehart asked some questions... - ...about the embarkation exercises. - Good for them. What was his name? - Calls himself Davis, sir. - Davis... Oh, yes, the police sergeant mentioned him. Well, I don't suppose there's anything wrong with the man, but there's no harm in checking up on him. I think I'll do it right away. A Mr. Davis? Yes, we have. A very nice gentleman. - He's been bombed out. - Has he been here very long? Oh, about a week I should think. Why, is anything wrong? No. I wonder if you'd mind pointing him out to me? Oh, very well. He's in the coffee room, I think, having tea. I wonder... I wonder if you can manage without him seeing me. Oh... very well. Come up this way. - There he is. - Thanks. - Good God! - That's not Mr. Davis. No, I know. Thank you very much. What, tin hat and gas mask and things? Oh, they've lain on a whole heap of new gadgets. Excuse me, can I speak to you for a moment? - Yes, sir. - I shan't keep him a second. - What's that girl doing here? - Why, she's perfectly all right, sir. - Yes, but what's she doing here? - She's playing at Westport. Is she staying in the hotel. No, she just happened to come over for the afternoon. - Very odd. - Yes, sir. Well, as a matter of fact she may... Well, I rather believe I did just mention Watercombe, sir. ...when we were at Newby, but she's perfectly all right, sir. - Is she staying here for dinner with you? - Yes, does that upset you? I'm delighted. - Nothing serious, I hope, Tommy? - Oh, no, nothing important. Well, as I was saying... Hello? Is that Westport 7713? I want to speak to Chief Inspector Jolly, please. - Who is that? - Police. - What do you want? - Are you Miss Clare's dresser? - Yes, I am, who are you? - Inspector Jolly, Special Branch, Westport. A lot of luggage for a stripteaser, hasn't she? - What's in that one? - Wardrobe and props. Oh, let me. Open that one. Nothing here, sir. I want to hang these up anyway. What about this one? Oh, I don't know, I haven't got the key to that, she keeps it. Give me the keys. What's in these? Oh, I don't know. Never seen them in me life before. I don't know everything she travels about with her. Well! The filthy little cow! Fancy using my bounty to cover up her blasted business! - Very pretty. - No, thanks. - Go on. - Oh, thanks. - You must have had a narrow escape. - I did indeed. I'm just getting over it. Well, you'll find it nice and quiet here. What made you think of Watercombe? Oh, I don't know. I used to come up here for my holidays as a boy, you know. - You lived in Newport long? - Not Newport, Cardiff. - Oh, I see. - You're wanted on the phone, sir. Thank you. Excuse me, please. Hello, Richards here. Yes, Jolly. You have? Good. You found what? My God. Yes, I know where she is, all right. You leave that to me. Yes. Yes, all right. Straight away, straight away. It took a hell of a lot of fixing... ...and they've given me the most awful place in the program. Shoved me right after the interval with everybody in the bar. Still, Tommy, it's worthwhile being together again. Hm, look who's back. Your little friend seems very busy, doesn't he? What is he, a military policeman or something? I think he thinks he is. And to top it all he's given me blue lights for my finale. They won't see a single thing out front. Excuse me, Miss, with Mrs. Taylor's compliments, ...will you please spare a moment with her in the office? - Well, what the hell? - Perhaps I'd better come too. Ne Tommy, dear, you stay there. Order me another drink. Keep it cool till I come back. Same again, please. - Two? - Yes. What the hell are you getting at? Well, I can dine with an officer if I like, can't I? You don't keep him locked up, do you? I have not been trying to give information. What do I care what the soldiers are doing? Three shillings, please. Westport 77250? Is that you, Ned? I got your letter about Aunt Mary. So sorry she's not well. I'd like to come and see her. Well, Cummings... You haven't got anything against her, have you, sir? I'm afraid you won't see her again. She's an enemy agent, all right. - What will they do to her, sir? - Try her in a court of law and hang her. Yes, and they sent a blimey squad car for her. Out from Westport. Took her straight to the clink. - That was quick work all right. - You bet. Fancy her being a German spy! Blimey, you wouldn't think a girl like that could hide anything. - Good evening, Sergeant. - What is it? It's Mr. Davis, sir. He's gone. - Gone? Where? When? - Tonight. A short while ago. He's gone to Harrogate. The arrest seemed to offset him. His nerves not being too good. - I see. - Only I thought I'd just let you know, sir. - Thanks. - Is there anything I can do, sir? - No, I don't think so, thanks. - Good night, sir. Good night. And who may Mr. Davis be? A rather suspicious character staying at the Whitehart, sir. Oh, not another one. These people seem to concentrate around you. You're a sort of fly paper for spies. As a matter of fact we've nothing against this man really, but I'm glad he's gone. I think the training area is fairly clear for the time being, sir. It was difficult enough as it was. Why you should send that girl to Watercombe when I'm there... I didn't send her, she doesn't work in this area. Well she was there today, and she's been arrested. So they know for certain now that we're working on 95th Brigade. They were already getting suspicious. Their security man sounded me this afternoon. - So that's it. Afraid of your own skin. - Don't be a fool. My value there is gone once they suspect me, you know that. In Watercombe, yes. If it happens, you can be more useful elsewhere. We've lost number 16. You will replace him. - What was he working on? - Ordnance depot. - Name, please. - Davis. This is a hard job, I don't know if it's quite what you were expecting. I'm down on my luck. Take this to the employment exchange. They'll give you a pass to get you into the depot. Report tomorrow morning at eight. Next, please. - New, ain't you, mate? - Yes. Big place, isn't it? Yea, I reckon they got enough explosives here to supply the whole ruddy army. - Any accidents? - Not yet. But they will have sooner or later with all these ruddy women about. There you are, what did I tell you? I wouldn't if I were you, mate. She won't thank you. What a burk. - Can I lend you a hand? - I can manage, thanks. I'm perfectly competent to do this job myself. Bad luck just when you were starting out. Damn careless these men about here. They sprinkle nails around like bird seed. That'll be all right. I shall never catch up with the others now. And I'll get hell from the sergeant. - What do you do around here? - I'm a hod carrier. - Hod what? - I'm a hod... - I'm helping to build a shelter. - Oh. Right... can you get the spare? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Have you always been a... I mean, you don't talk a bit like a... whatever it is you are. I suppose I don't. I had a little business of my own. It was bombed. - I... I lost all my savings in it. - Oh! What a shame. - Thanks. - That's all right. - Have one? - Oh, thanks very much. Oh, is that all right here? Oh, yes, the explosive shed's right down there. - Thank you. - Thanks. I say, why don't you come to our dance tonight? I didn't know there was one. Yes, it's in the gymnasium, the ATS weekly dance. - This'll get you in. I'll look out for you. - Thank you. - Good evening. - Good evening, hello. Going to the dance. - Hey, not that way. - Oh, thanks. I'm jolly glad you were able to come. Bit of a squash, isn't it? But the band is marvelous. Do you know Sergeant Ramsbottom? I've forgotten what your name is. Davis. Come on, let's go and have something, shall we? - What will you have? - No, these are on me. I'm the hostess here. - Beer then, please. - The same here. Two beers and a shandy, please. You know, I'm simply whacked. We drove all the way there and back with only half an hour's break. - Where did you go? - Just outside West... - Now, now, no giving away secrets. - I'm not doing anything of the kind. Oh, there's Sergeant Hayhearst. She left her flapjack in our mess. Um, we'll have the next one, shall we? Hot in here. - Hm, cigarette? - Thanks. - What's your job? - I'm working for the builders. - Oh, lucky man. - Why? Well, you keep regular hours, don't you? I do 12-hour shifts and even then I'm lucky if I get off. - It must be very busy here. - Busy? Do you realize that we have to maintain 150.000 vehicles... ...in this place and they all think their requirements are urgent? To give you an example. We've got two divisions going overseas next week. On top of that I get a request for a whole lot of special equipment... ...from the 95th Brigade. Immediate, that is. Now, I ask you, what could be more immediate than sending two divisions overseas? Oh no. I tell you, I shall end this war in a padded cell. Oh, match? I've got a date for this one. So long. Well? Two divisions are going overseas next week. The 95th Brigade is getting special equipment, explosives, etc., - ...sent with immediate priority. - Immediate? The two divisions tally with what I already know. There's a convoy leaving Westport towards the end of next week for the Near East. But... the 95th Brigade? - Where are they going? - I don't know. You'd better go back to Watercombe and find out! I can't do that. I made an excuse for leaving If I went back I'd be under suspicion at once. You'll have to send someone else. I have no one I can spare. It would be madness for me to go back either to Watercombe or to the ordnance depot. Very well. There'll be other work for you to do. You report here daily by phone and until I can give you instructions. Good day, Mr. Davis. Good day, Miss Leemans. Miss Leemans? Sit down, will you? I have some rather disquieting news for you. Your parents are in danger in Rotterdam. They are suspected of sabotage. How do you know that? Oh, I have ways of finding out these things. You mustn't fret. I think I've found a way to help them. - I will do anything! - I know that. You're going to see your young man in Watercombe on Sunday. Yes. Oh, please do not tell anyone. He sent that letter uncensored. I'm not supposed to know where he is. - I understand that. - But what has this to do with my parents? Miss Leemans, you can be very useful to me. Yes, Mr. Barratt? I want you to find out where his brigade is going. And when. - Why do you want to know that? - For a report I'm preparing. A report? I don't understand. A report for Berlin. My mother was a German, Miss Leemans. I am a German. I do my duty as a good German must. The 95th Brigade is going on a certain exercise. - You will find out for me what it is. - I would not dream of doing such a thing. I am a refugee here, I've had great kindness from the English. I couldn't... Miss Leemans, are the English... is your young man even, of more importance to you than the health of your family in Rotterdam? - Mr. Barratt... - Do I need to speak more plainly? You will get this information for me on Sunday... ...or your family will be taken into protective custody. The order has already been issued. It can be canceled if you provide this information. Nothing else can save them from... Nothing else, remember. Answer the shop, will you? Good morning, you were getting a book for me, Commander Bowen. Oh, yes, sir, I have it ready. That is right, I think. - Oh, yes, it is right. - Good morning. This information... Could anything happen to the brigade because of it? Happen? No, of course not. I told you, it's for a report. A matter of routine - Gosh, it's good to see you. - John, you're looking fine. - You're not looking too well. - After all the trouble I have taken. Anything wrong? Let's get out of here. Up on the cliffs out of the way. May I not see where you are living? Good Lord, no, there would be a hell of a row if you were found here. That's why I said to stop outside the village. - Why? - Red tape. Do you mean because I am an alien? You needn't look so guilty. No, it's because no one's supposed to know we're here. - Is it so very secret then? - You'd be surprised. Gosh, this is good. Oh, it has been so wonderful today. So far from the war. - Now we have to go back to it. - We needn't pack up yet. I have to catch the bus, it's the last today. Oh, gosh, I forgot. We'll just make it. John, may I come again next Sunday? - I shall be gone by then. - Gone? Where? Those three ships in the river are ready to take us right away into the blue. - Tomorrow? - Well, I don't know exactly when. John, do you know what it is you are going to do? I'm just an ordinary soldier. I don't believe even the officers don't know until they get the mosaics. - Mosaics? - Yes, but don't let's waste precious time. Whatever happens you needn't worry, darling. We're a pick brigade, we know our stuff. - You ready? - We cannot say good bye at the bus. - Say good bye to me now. - Darling. - Better take cover, miss. - All right, I will. Hm, you just got back in time, didn't you, Miss Leemans? I hope you had a pleasant day. You know Mr. Davis, don't you? You can speak quite freely in front of him. - Good evening. - Good evening. I trust you got the information I wanted, Miss Leemans? No, I did not. The others don't know where they are going. Well then, does he know when they're going or where from? Straight from their camp. - On board of ships out on the bay. - I see. You're quite certain he doesn't know their destination? Quite sure. Not even the officers will till they get their... Their what? - Mosaics, I think the word is. - Mosai... Aerial photographs. Thank you, Miss Leemans. You'd better get home now before the raid becomes any worse. My parents... They'll be perfectly safe... for the time being. Your case. You can let yourself out, can't you, Miss Leemans? - Well? - Aerial photographs. They're so damned hard to get. From them we can find the brigade's objective. We must get at least a portion of those mosaics. Either identify it ourselves or send it to Berlin. We've got a man leaving in 24-hour's time with some other information. Take this dental plate to London at once. Ask for an appointment with Dr. Walter. That's his address. This dental plate will introduce you. - I hope I get back in time. - Get back as soon as you can. If the shop isn't open, let yourself in with this. The night train for London leaves at 9:30. You've got plenty of time to catch it. Good luck. You told me that information was a routine matter. - How did you get in here? - Never mind that. - The brigade is in danger. You lied to me. - Not at all. - Then why have you sent that man to London? - Oh, he was going anyway. He was not. I heard all you said. That information is important. The brigade is in danger. John... And you told me nothing could happen. Well, naturally, I could hardly expect you to get that information if I told... I'll have to wait... Nothing incriminating was left there, you're sure of that? Positive, I'm giving you all the papers, and here's the transmitter. The police will assume that the girl murdered Barrat and then committed suicide. Now, about those mosaics. It won't be easy. If we steal a copy, it will be discovered and the operation will probably be canceled A copy must be borrowed, photographed and then returned. - You realize how urgent it is? - Perfectly. Fortunately the English are usually very careless about such things. Well, if you will look in about 5 o'clock this afternoon, I'll do my best to have your plate ready for you. I'm very grateful. Good morning, Doctor. Good morning. - Is Mr. Vernon here yet? - He's waiting, Doctor. Ask him to come in, will you? Good morning, Doctor. - Oh, good morning, Mr. Vernon. How have you been after the extraction? No pain, I hope? - No, none at all. - Good. Well, let's have a look at things. Now, I've got an urgent job for you. We want a copy of a mosaic that's being sent to Watercombe to the 95th Brigade. - Gosh, that's a tough one. - Yes, I know. They'll be preparing it now at the interpretation unit. Now, I suggest... Hello, Interpretation Unit. Yes? Air Ministro? Which ondes? For Watercombe? But I've already told the Air Ministry they'll be ready today by 1 o'clock. - They'll be flown straight up. - And the Air Ministry copy? Wing Commander Kenton will fetch it himself. I don't know why there's any need for you to check up everything twice. Yes, 1 o'clock. Caf? Regon. - Get me a dry sherry. - Yes, sir. Whisky and soda, please. - Am I late? - No, darling, you're bang on time. - Have a drink? - No, thanks, but I'm starving. Let's go straight in. I mustn't leave my secret documents lying about. Are they really secret? Not really, but I like to think they are. - This way, please, sir. - Is this all right, darling? - Lovely. Grand! Table, please, waiter. I'm sorry, sir, we have no table for a few minutes. Reserve this one for me when it's disengaged, will you, I'll be back in ten minutes. I'm sorry, we're all out of stock of those. I'm afraid these are all we've got left, sir. Hm... yes, I'll take that one, thanks. Thank you. Good day, sir, thank you. - Oh, you're mad. - Why not? - Okay? - Yes, sir. Good. - Anyone call me? - Yes, several people. Oh, hell! That's not my briefcase. - You must have taken someone else's. - Blast! - What's that? - Oh, I'm so sorry. - Where have you been? - Now let me see... I had lunch at the Caf? Regon. I had it when I was there. Get me the Caf? Regon. You can get Court-Martialed for that sort of thing, you know.. - Now, don't frighten me. - Was there anything important in it? Nothing, only a certain mosaic the combined ops people wanted to show to the cabinet. They're probably out of date anyhow. Is that the Caf? Regon? Give me the hall porter. This is Wing Commander Kenton... Oh, you have, splendid. Well, hang on to it, will you? I'll go around and fetch it and bring the other one back. What a bit of luck. Some fellow took mine by mistake. - He's just brought it back. - No Court-Martial after all. No, no harm done. - Mr. Davis. - Good afternoon, Mr. Davis. - I've got your plate ready for you. - Spendid. Quick work. - Can you identify the place? - Unfortunately no. I suggest you take one section only, the rest I'll burn. Barratt told me nothing about his courier. How do I find him? I've been in touch with Barratt's number 2. Palmer's the name. I found his address amongst Barratt's papers. He'll be sending off a courier tonight from Westport. I'll warn him you're coming. Now, which is the most suitable section? - You say you know this place? - I was born there, sir. You will have no difficulty landing your men on the beaches. The harbor itself is more complicated. Then you'd better go in with the main party. - Very well, sir. - You'll be able to help them. And will you explain the general layout of the harbor to the CRE here? You can, uh... You can let the men know they're sailing tomorrow night. - Yes, sir. - For Arabia. You're on parade? With your cap on? You know, it's so hot out East the hens lay hard-boiled eggs? - How do you know? - Because I've been out East. - Oh, Anything happened to you out there? - Yeah, I nearly went West. Pity you didn't. What are you going to do with that, Johnny, put it in a bottle and chuck it overboard? - Maybe. - Blimey! What is it? Some people are never satisfied. Here's a couple done themselves in in the middle of an air raid. They can't do that, it ain't fair. "At the height of a recent raid on Westport, George Barratt, a local bookseller, and his assistant Beppie Leemans, a Dutch refugee... ...ended their lives in what appears to be a suicide pact. In a gas-filled room at the back of the shop... ...the police found the bodies of Barratt and his assistant. Both had been dead for some hours." - Yes? - Does Mr. Palmer live here? That's me. You'd better come inside. I've come from Dr. Walter. Ah, something for the courier? You're just in time. I had a job to keep him. - This is very urgent. - Don't worry, it'll get there. - Good night. - Good night. - Shan't keep you a minute now. - I'm hoping you won't. I should be away from the docks before they start setting the town on fire. - Go easy with those cigarettes. - Oh, to hell! Fix it so it doesn't crackle. And I'll tell you one thing. I'm not the one to be taking any more tricks to this country. Not for all the danger money in the Bank of England. We pay you well enough, don't we? It's little enough I get for the double danger I go through. There you are. - Not bad. - ARP lectures have their uses. More than the British realize. Better go. - What's the matter with your arm, chum? - Oh, incendiary the night before last. - Souvenir of Westport, eh? - That's right. Take care of it. You better get a move on. Oh, the Holy Mother herself will be needing a tin hat on a night like this. - Good night now. - Good night. Well, Richards, that's about the end of your part of the job. If the Boche hears we're coming, I don't think it will be your fault. - And thanks for all you've done. - Best of luck, sir. Hello? Hello, Mr. Palmer? I've seen the three girls off to school. They look nice in their new summer kit, eh? Good bye. The 95th Brigade sailed from Watercombe this evening, equipped for the tropics. Looks as though we've been wasting our time, Horn. The brigade is evidently joining the convoy going East. We shall know as soon as the mosaic arrives. Where is this mosaic? It is due to reach Spain tomorrow morning. From there it will come in a diplomatic bag. If it catches the morning plane, we should have it in the afternoon. Tell them to hold the plane for it. Until we have that mosaic... ...we have no evidence that the brigade is coming any nearer to us than North Africa. - This is urgent. - I know. - Can I try one of these. - Bitte sch?n. Ah. It looks as if we shall certainly be able to land you at dawn tomorrow. Well, gentlemen, the Brigadier has decided that zero hour tomorrow... will be at 05:45 hours. - Is that before or after dawn? - Just before dawn. Hello, chaps. Are you all buttoned up for dawn tomorrow? Yes, sir! - Have you warned your men for op inspection? - No, but I'll see about it, sir. Right. Come on now, jump to it! Jump to it! Blimey, he is chucking his weight about. Three stripes for chasing a German spy. Norville. Well, gentlemen, just a final recapitulation... ...to make sure there can be no misunderstanding concerning the call signs. The right battalion will land on Beach A and we'll use the call Verney. The left battalion will land on Beach B, and we'll use the call Carlos. The center battalion will enter the harbor followed by the sappers... ...and they will both use the call Martin. Brigade headquarters will use the call Drake. Now don't forget. The sappers have got a big job on the lock gates. They'll need all the time I've given them. Well, it's getting on towards time we dropped anchor. We shall be in position X in 30 minutes. - No chance of any slip-up, is there? - I hope not, sir. All the battalion commanders are quite happy, the air corporation is laid on. We've just had confirmation that the bombers will cross the coastline... ...just as the first landing is made. So they should be able to take care of any possible interference around here. Fine. If everything goes according to plan, the first flight of Verney should be at Beach A in 3 minutes. Sie sind hier. The first flight of Verney must be going up these cliffs now. And the first flight of Carlos should just about be approaching Beach B. Quiet clippers! Don't look up! Okay, Sergeant. I'll go around the flank there, you follow up. Okay. The second flight of Verney has just embarked, sir. Right, let them go. - Message from Verney, sir. - All right, thanks. Verney says landing successful, heavy opposition being encountered. Why, what's happened, sir? There'd be no heavy opposition there unless the Boche knew something. - But that's impossible, sir. - Nothing's impossible. Wonder what's happening to Carlos. About time we had something from him. Battalion headquarters should be ashore by now. Try and get in touch with them. I'll see you all up there. Come around here. - Are they all out? - They're all here, sir. - I'm going to have a look. - One minute, sir. V-company have called you, sir. They're practically finished. That sounds bad. You'd better tell brigade. Come on, Donald. Hello Drake, hello Drake. This is Carlos calling. Carlos calling. I have a message for you. Hello Carlos, hello Carlos, Drake calling. Message from Carlos, sir "Enemy in force, first flight wiped out." Bill, tell them to put plan Edward into force immediately, there's no time to waste. We land brigade headquarters on Beach A at once. Send a message to aircraft to attack town objectives without delay. Get ready to land Martin on both sides of the harbor at once. The sooner we get on the job, the better. A message from aircraft, sir. "Successfully completed job", that's the bombing of the aerodrome, sir... "but report enemy land reinforcements in strength approaching from East." I said nothing was impossible, didn't I? It's quite obvious now the Boche knows enough about this show. Are those our fellows? - Yes, I think so, sir. - Quick work. Good. All right, that's their position. What the hell's happened to Carlos? - Bill. - Yes. - What about Carlos? - I don't know. I keep trying to get them. Runner, go and tell signals to try and get Carlos again. Yes, sir. Please try to get Carlos again, sir. Hello Carlos, hello Carlos. Drake calling. Drake calling. Hello Carlos. Drake calling, Drake calling. Report situation. Drake to Carlos, over. Are you receiving me? - Tell them there's no reply. - Very good, sir. - No reply from Carlos, sir. - Well, tell them to keep trying. Very good, sir. - What's that over there? - Dive bombers.. Pretty near too. Must be Verney. Well if it is, they're getting a hell of a packet. Those aren't dive bombers. No, they're heavies, heading for our ships too by the look of it. - Did you hear that? - Guns, wasn't it, sir? Yes, I'm afraid it was. Damn it, that was close. - Getting a bit warm. - Looks as if they're getting the range Two messages, sir. The object of the raid has been achieved. Lock gates, oil storage tanks, harbor equipment were destroyed. One enemy submarine was put out of action. Although losses both in men and craft were very heavy. The enemy had been warned. He had been waiting for us. And although our troops fought throughout with great skill and gallantry, they were not able to affect the surprise that had been hoped for. They paid the price of bad security. The next of kin of casualties had been informed. Nasty casualty list today. Yes, a bit of a blow. Wonder where it was. Papers don't give away much, do they? Well, as a matter of fact, I think I can enlighten you on that point. This is only the beginning of things, I'm afraid. - Quite in confidence, of course. - Oh, yes, yes, of course, naturally. I have a friend who's director of a big munitions factory and... - He asked me not to mention it, naturally. - Got a light? Oh, thank you, sir. Well, to cut a long story short, this fellow has a brother who knows somebody in the War Office... and I think you can take it as a pretty authentic kind of a British source... ...but apparently there's a big stunt coming off about the middle of next month. - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
