Give me the child. Through dangers untold and hardships unnumbered... ...I have fought my way here to the castle beyond the Goblin City... ...to take back the child that you have stolen. For my will is as strong as yours... ...and my kingdom is as great. For my will is as strong as yours, my kingdom as great. Damn. Oh, I can never remember that line. "You have no power over me." Oh, Merlin. Oh, no, Merlin. I don't believe it. It's 7:00! Come on. Come on! Oh, it's not fair! Oh, really. - I'm sorry. - Well, don't stand there in the rain. - Come on. - All right. Come on, Merlin. - Come on. - Not the dog. - But it's pouring. - Go on, into the garage. Oh. Go on, Merlin. Go into the garage. Go. Sarah, you're an hour late. I said I'm sorry! Please let me finish. - Your father and I go out very rarely. - You go out every single weekend. I ask you to babysit only if it won't interfere with your plans. Well, how do you know? You don't know what my plans are. I assume you'd tell me if you had a date. I'd like it if you had a date. - You should have dates at your age. - Ah, Sarah, you're home. - We were worried about you. - I can't do anything right, can I? She treats me like a wicked stepmother in a fairy story no matter what I say. I'll talk to her. Through dangers untold... ...and hardships unnumbered... ...I have fought my way here to the castle... ...beyond the Goblin City... ...to take back the child... ...that you have stolen. - Sarah, can I talk to you? - There's nothing to talk about! You better hurry. You're gonna be late. Listen, we fed Toby and put him to bed. We do have to leave now, but we'll be back around midnight. You really wanted to talk to me, didn't you? Practically broke down the door. Lancelot! Someone has been in my room again. I hate that. I hate it! I hate you. I hate you! Someone save me, someone take me away from this awful place! What do you want? You want a story, huh? Okay. Once upon a time, there was a beautiful, young girl... ...whose stepmother always made her stay home with the baby. And the baby was a spoiled child and he wanted everything for himself... And the baby was a spoiled child and he wanted everything for himself... ...and the young girl was practically a slave. But what no one knew... ...was that the king of the goblins had fallen in love with the girl... ...and he had given her certain powers. So one night... ...when the baby had been particularly cruel to her... ...she called on the goblins for help. Listen. "Say your right words," the goblins said. "And we'll take the baby to the Goblin City... ...and you will be free." Ah! But the girl knew that the king of the goblins... ...would keep the baby in his castle forever and ever and ever... ...and turn it into a goblin. And so the girl suffered in silence... ...until one night, when she was tired from a day of housework... ...and she was hurt by the harsh words of her stepmother... ...and she could no longer stand it... Oh, all right, all right. Knock it off. Come on. Stop it! Stop it! I'll say the words. No, I mustn't. I mustn't say. I wish... I wish... - She's going to say it. - Say what? - Shut up. - Sorry. You shut up. Listen. She's going to say the words. I can bear it no longer! Goblin King, Goblin King, wherever you may be... ...take this child of mine far away from me! Oh... That's not it. Where'd she learn that rubbish? It doesn't even start with "I wish." Oh, Toby, stop it! Oh, I wish I did know what to say to make the goblins take you away. "I wish the goblins would come and take you away right now." That's not hard, is it? Huh? I wish... I wish... - Did she say it? - Shut up! I wish the goblins would come and take you away. Right now. Toby? Toby, are you all right? Why aren't you crying? You're him, aren't you? You're the Goblin King. I want my brother back, please, if it's all the same. What's said is said. But I didn't mean it. - Oh, you didn't? - Please. Where is he? You know very well where he is. Please bring him back. Please. Sarah... ...go back to your room... ...play with your toys and your costumes. Forget about the baby. I can't. I've brought you a gift. - What is it? - It's a crystal. Nothing more. But if you turn it this way... ...look into it... ...it'll show you your dreams. But this is not a gift for an ordinary girl... ...who takes care of a screaming baby. Do you want it? Then forget the baby. I can't. It isn't that I don't appreciate what you're trying to do for me... ...but I want my brother back. - He must be so scared. - Sarah. Don't defy me. You're no match for me, Sarah. But I have to have my brother back. He's there, in my castle. Do you still want to look for him? Is that the castle beyond the Goblin City? Turn back, Sarah. Turn back before it's too late. I can't. Don't you understand that I can't? What a pity. It doesn't look that far. It's further than you think. Time is short. You have 13 hours in which to solve the labyrinth... ...before your baby brother... ...becomes one of us... ...forever. Such a pity. The labyrinth. It doesn't look that hard. Well, come on, feet. Excuse me? Oh, uh, excuse me! Oh, it's you. Excuse me, but I have to get through this labyrinth. Can you help me? Hm. Oh, how sweet. Fifty-seven! Heh, heh. - How could you? - Yeah. Poor thing. You monster. Ow! - Uh? - It bit me! Ha, ha, ha! What did you expect fairies to do? I thought they did nice things, like granting wishes. Shows what you know, don't it? - Fifty-eight. Blah. - You're horrible. Huh? No, I ain't. I'm Hoggle. Who are you? - Sarah. - That's what I thought. Heh, heh. Fifty-nine. Do you know where the door to the labyrinth is? - Maybe. - Well, where is it? Oh, you little... Sixty! Ooh-ha! - I said, where is it? - Where is what? - The door. - What door? - It's hopeless asking you anything. - Not if you ask the right questions. How do I get into the labyrinth? Ah! Now, that's more like it. You gets in there. You, uh, really going in there, are you? Yes. I'm afraid I have to. Cozy, isn't it? Now, would you go left or right? - They both look the same. - Well, you're not gonna get very far. - Which way would you go? - Me? I wouldn't go either way. If that's all the help you're gonna be, you can just leave. You know your problem? You take too many things for granted. Take this labyrinth. Even if you get to the center, you'll never get out again. - That's your opinion. - Well, it's a lot better than yours. Thanks for nothing, Hogwart. Oh, it's Hoggle! And don't say I didn't warn you. Oh... Who's she? What do they mean, "labyrinth"? There aren't turns or corners or anything. This just goes on and on. Maybe it doesn't. Maybe I'm just taking it for granted that it does. Oh! Oh. 'Allo. Did you say "hello"? No, I said, "'Allo," but that's close enough. - You're a worm, aren't you? - Yeah, that's right. You don't by any chance know the way through this labyrinth, do you? Who, me? No, I'm just a worm. Oh. Come inside, meet the missus. No, thank you, but I have to solve this labyrinth. But there aren't any turns or any openings or anything. It just goes on and on. Well, you ain't looking right. It's full of openings, it's just you ain't seeing them. - Well, where are they? - There's one just across there. It's right in front of you. No, there isn't. Come inside and have a nice cup of tea. - But there isn't an opening. - Ha, ha, of course there is. You try walking through it. You'll see what I mean. - What? - Go on. Go on, then. That's just wall. There's no way through. Things are not always what they seem in this place. So you can't take anything for granted. Hey! - Hey. Hang on. - Thank you. - That was incredibly helpful. - But don't go that way. - What was that? - I said, don't go that way. Never go that way. Oh. Thanks. Cor! If she had kept on going down that way... ...she'd have gone straight to that castle. Toby. I'm coming, Toby. Give me back this! Go on, get off me. Stay out of the way. What are you talking about? Walk, walk, walk. What's the matter? - You remind me of the babe. - What babe? - The babe with the power. - What power? - The power of voodoo. - Who do? - You do. - Do what? Remind me of the babe. Quiet! A goblin babe. Well? Hey, what goes on? Is a-writing on the fragging walk-walk! Your mother is a fragging aardvark! In nine hours and 23 minutes... ...you'll be mine. - You got it? - I got it. Good. Shh. Oh, no. Someone has been changing my marks. What a horrible place this is. It's not fair! That's right. It's not fair. But that's only half of it. This was a dead end a minute ago. No, that's the dead end behind you. It keeps changing. What am I supposed to do? Well, the only way out of here is to try one of these doors. One of them leads to the castle at the center of the labyrinth. And the other one leads to... - Ba-ba-ba-bum. - Certain death. Ooh. Which one is which? - We can't tell you. - Why not? - Um... - I, uh... - We don't know. - But they do. Oh. Then I'll ask them. No, you can't ask us. You can only ask one of us. It's in the rules. And I should warn you... ...that one of us always tells the truth, and one of us always lies. That's a rule too. He always lies. - I do not. I tell the truth. - Oh, what a lie. He's the liar. All right. Answer yes or no. Would he tell me that this door leads to the castle? Uh... - What do you think? - I don't know. Yes. Then the other door leads to the castle... ...and this door leads to certain death. Ooh. How do you know? He could be telling the truth. But then you wouldn't be. So if you told me that he said yes, I know the answer is no. - But I could be telling the truth. - But then he would be lying. So if you told me that he said yes, I know the answer would still be no. Wait a minute. Is that right? I don't know. I've never understood it. No, it's right. I've figured it out. I could never do it before. I think I'm getting smarter. This is a piece of cake. Help! Stop it! Help! What do you mean, "help"? We are helping. We're helping hands. You're hurting. Would you like us to let go? No! Well then, come on, which way? Which way? Up or down? - Oh. - Come on, come on. We haven't got all day. Well, it's a big decision for her. Which way do you want to go? Hm? Yes, which way? Well, since I'm pointed that way, I guess I'll go down. She chose down. She chose down? - Was that wrong? - Too late now. Ha, ha, ha! She's in the oubliette. Shut up! She should not have gotten as far as the oubliette. - She should have given up by now. - She'll never give up. Won't she? The dwarf's about to lead her back to the beginning. She'll soon give up when she realizes she has to start all over again. Ha, ha! Well, laugh. Who's there? Me. - Oh, it's you. - Yes, well... I knew you were gonna get into trouble as soon as I met you. So I've come to give you a hand. Heh, heh. Oh, you're looking around now, aren't you? I suppose you noticed there ain't no doors. Only the hole. This is an oubliette. The labyrinth's full of them. - Really? How do you know that? - Oh, don't sound so smart. You don't even know what an oubliette is. Do you? Yes, it's a place you put people to forget about them. Now, what you've gotta do is get out of here. And it so happens that I know a shortcut... ...out of the whole labyrinth from here. No, I'm not giving up now. I've come too far. - No, I'm doing okay. - Of course you are. But it gets a lot worse from here on in. Why are you so concerned about me? Well, I am, that's all. Nice, young girl. Terrible, black oubliette. You like jewelry, don't you? Why? If you help me solve the labyrinth, I'll give you this. - You like it, don't you? - Uh... - So-so. - Oh. Okay. Tell you what. You give me the bracelet and I'll show you the way out of the labyrinth. - You were gonna do that anyway. - Yes, well... ...that's what would make it a particularly nice gesture on your part. No. I'll tell you what. If you won't take me to the center, take me as far as you can... - ...and then I'll do it on my own. - What is that anyway? Plastic. Ooh. I don't promise nothing, but... I'll take you as far as I can. Then you're on your own, right? - Right. - Right. Ooh. Plastic! Here we go. Damn. Broom closet. Well, can't be right all the time. This is it. Come on, then. Ooh. - This way. - Don't go on. Go back while you still can. This is not the way. Take heed and go no further. Beware. Beware. Soon it will be too late. Ah! Don't pay any attention to them. They're just false alarms. You get a lot of them in the labyrinth. Especially when you're on the right track. - Oh, no, you're not. - Oh, shut up. - Sorry. Just doing my job. - You don't have to do it to us. - Beware, for... - Just forget it. Please, I haven't said it for such a long time. Oh, all right, but don't expect a big reaction. No, no, no, of course not. For the path you will take will lead to certain destruction. - Thank you very much. - Uh-oh. Oh, no. Ah. What have we here? - Nothing. - Nothing? Nothing? Nothing? Nothing, tra-la-la? Your Majesty, what a nice surprise. - Hello, Hedgewart. - Hogwart. Hoggle! Hoggle, can it be that you're helping this girl? Helping? In what sense? In the sense that you're leading her towards the castle. No, no, I was taking her back to the beginning, Your Majesty. What? I told her I was gonna help her solve the labyrinth... ...a little trickery on my part, but actually... What is that plastic thing round your wrist? Oh... Oh, this? Oh, my goodness, where did this come from? - Higgle... - Hoggle. Yes. If I thought for one second that you were betraying me... ...I'd be forced to suspend you headfirst in the Bog of Eternal Stench. No, Your Majesty! Not the Eternal Stench! Oh, yes, Hoggle! And you, Sarah. How are you enjoying my labyrinth? It's a piece of cake. Oh... Really? Then how about upping the stakes. Hm? That's not fair! You say that so often. I wonder what your basis for comparison is. So the labyrinth's a piece of cake, is it? Well, let's see how you deal with this little slice. No, no, the cleaners! - What? - Run! You okay? Come on! Faster! - Hoggle! - Oh, no! The cleaners! The Bog of Stench! You sure got his attention. Ah, this is what we need. A ladder. Follow me. How can I trust you when I know you were taking me back to the beginning? I wasn't. I told him I was taking you back to the beginning to throw him off the scent. Hoggle, how can I believe anything you say? Well, let me put it this way. What choice have you got? You're right. You see, you've gotta understand my position. I'm a coward, and Jareth scares me. - What kind of position is that? - No position. That's my point. And you wouldn't be so brave if you'd ever smelled... ...the Bog of Eternal Stench. It's... It's... Is that all it does, is smell? Oh, believe me, that's enough. But the worst thing is, if you so much... ...as put a foot in the Bog of Stench... ...you'll smell bad for the rest of your life. It'll never wash off. Ah. Here we are, then. You're on your own from now on. - What? - That's it. I quit. Wait a minute. Hoggle. I said I didn't promise nothing. I said I'd take you as far as I could go. You little cheat. You nasty, little cheat. Now, don't try to embarrass me. I've got no pride. Oh, yeah? But them's my jewels! You give them back! Give them back. Give those back. - Ah-ah! - Give those back to me! Now, there's the castle. Which way should we try? Them's my rightful property. It's not fair! No, it isn't. But that's the way it is. Hm? Ooh. Excuse me, please, but can you help me? Oh! A young girl! Woo, woo, woo. And who is this? - My friend. - Well, yes. And what can I do for you? Please, can you tell...? That is... I have to get to the castle at the center of the labyrinth. Do you know the way? Ah. Ah. Well, yes, now. You want to get to the castle. How's that for brainpower, huh? Be quiet! Ah, nuts. So, young woman... ...the way forward is sometimes the way back. Ay, will you listen to this crap? - Will you please be quiet! - Sorry. All right. - Okay? - Okay! - All right. - All right! - What? - Sorry. Finished? Yes. Quite often, young lady... ...it seems like we're not getting anywhere, when in fact... - We are. - We are. I'm certainly not getting anywhere at the moment. Ha! Join the club. I think that's your lot. Please leave a contribution in the little box. Don't you dare! Them's mine. Well, I guess I can spare this. Gracias, senorita. You didn't have to give him that. He didn't tell you nothing. Well, then, there go a couple of suckers. It's so stimulating being your hat. Why did you say that... ...about my being your friend? Because you are. You're not be much of a friend, but you're the only friend I've got in this place. Do you hear something? - No, it's all right. - Friend. I like that. I ain't never been no one's friend before. - Goodbye! - Wait a minute. - Keep the stuff. - Are you my friend or not? No, I'm not. Hoggle ain't no one's friend. He looks after himself, like everyone. Hoggle is Hoggle's friend. Hoggle, you coward! Well, I'm not afraid. Things aren't always what they seem in this place. Try on this for size, you big yeti! We've got you now, fuzz ball! All together, now. If only I had something to throw. Sock it to him! Sock it to him! What happened? Who turned out the light? I can't see! - Why'd you bite me? - Who bite who? Who bite me? Who bite me? - I can't see! - What is going on? Retreat! Who bit me? My aching sushi! Now, stop that. Is that any way to treat someone who's trying to help you? Don't you want me to help you down? Ludo down. Ludo? Is that your name? Ludo. You seem like such a nice beast. Well, I certainly hope you are what you seem to be. Just hang on. I'll get you down. Just a second. Oh, I'm sorry! Ludo, are you hurt? Ludo? Friend? That's right, Ludo. I'm Sarah. Sarah. Here, let me help you. Are you okay? Sarah. Sarah friend. Now, wait, heh. Just a second. - I want to ask you something, Ludo. - Hm? What? I have to get to the castle at the center of the labyrinth. Do you know the way? Uh, um... Uh... - No. - You don't know either, huh? I wonder if anyone knows how to get through this labyrinth. Get through the labyrinth. Get through the labyrinth. One thing for sure. She'll never get through the labyrinth. Hey. Where did they come from? What do you think, Ludo? Which shall we choose out of these two ugly characters? It's very rude to stare! I'm sorry. I was just wondering which door to choose. - What? - It's no good asking him. - He's as deaf as a post. - Don't talk with your mouth full. - I'm not talking with my mouth full! - Wait a second. - I can't understand you. - What were you saying? Ah. - It is so good to get that thing out. - What were you saying? I said, it's no good talking to him. He's deaf as a post. Mumble, mumble. You're a wonderful conversational companion. You can talk! All you do is moan! No good. Can't hear you. Oh. - Where do these doors lead? - What? Search me. We're just the knockers. Oh. - How do I get through? - Huh? Knock, and the door will open. Oh. - Ludo. - Huh? I don't want that thing back in my mouth. - Come on. I want to knock. - Uh-uh. Doesn't want his ring back in his mouth, eh? Can't say I blame him. - Sorry. - That's all right. I'm used to it. Come on, Ludo. You're welcome. He's a lively little chap. I think I'll call him Jareth. He's got my eyes. Ludo scared. Oh. Give me your hand. Come on. Imagine a big thing like you being scared. Yeah. See, Ludo? There's nothing to be afraid of. Ludo. Ludo. Ludo? Ludo, where are you? Ludo. Bah! Hoggle, help! - I'm coming, Sarah. - Well, if it isn't you. And, uh, where are you going? Uh, uh... Well, the little lady gave me the slip... ...but I just hears her now. So I was about to lead her back to the beginning... ...like you told me. - I see. - Ludo! For one moment I thought you were running to help her. But no, not after my warnings. - That would be stupid. - Oh, you bet it would! Me help her after your warnings? - Oh, dear. Poor Hoghead. - Hoggle. I've just noticed your lovely jewels are missing. Oh, yes, so they are. My lovely jewels. Let me think. I better find them, but first I'm off to take the little lady... ...back to the beginning of the labyrinth just like we planned. Wait. I've got a much better plan, Hoggle. Give her this. What is it? It's a present. It ain't gonna hurt the little lady, is it? Oh, now, why the concern? - Uh... I won't do nothing to harm her. - Come, come, come, Hogbrain. I'm surprised at you, losing your head over a girl. I ain't lost my head. You don't think a young girl could ever like... ...a repulsive little scab like you, do you? - She said we was... - What? Bosom companions? Friends? - Don't matter. - You'll give her that, Hoggle... ...or I'll tip you straight into the Bog of Eternal Stench... ...before you can blink. Yes. Right. And, Hoggle... ...if she ever kisses you, I'll turn you into a prince. You...? You will? Prince of the Land of Stench. Ludo? Ludo? What's going on? - What do you want? - What, us? We just have to have a good time. That's right! Yeah, woo! Like the man said, don't lose your head. Hey, I'm a wild child. Whoo! Walk tall. Yeah. Roll them. Snake eyes! Hey, lady! Fore! Bad luck. Think small. Bang heads! Hey, listen up. Shake your pretty little head. Tap your pretty little feet. Come on! Come on! Hey, hey! Her head don't come off. Of course it doesn't! - She's right. It's stuck on. - Hey, lady. Where you going with a head like that? Hey, man, I know what we can do. Take off her head! Yeah, let's take her apart. Hey, lady, that's his head. - That's my head! - That's a friend of mine. What are you doing? Hey! Whoa! Hey, lady! It's against the rules to throw other people's heads. You're only allowed to throw your own head. Yeah, that's right. Where's the referee? Now we got to take your head off. - Somebody stop her. - Come back, little lady. Play the game. Yeah, we're going to throw your head. You can't quit. The game's not over. - Hey, lady! - Leave me alone! We get a free throw. Hey, lady, you want to take your head off, don't you? Sure she does. - Hoggle. - Grab it! Don't you want to look like us? Leave me alone. It won't hurt! Get a saw! If you play, we'll take off your arms! - Take off your ear. - You don't need two ears. - Game's almost over. - Down's up. - Shoo! Go away. - Hoggle, you've come to help me. Don't kiss me! Don't kiss me! No, no, no! Hoggle, hold on. Oh, my God. Ugh. What is it? The Bog of Eternal Stench! I've never smelled anything like it. It's like... It doesn't matter what it's like. It's a Bog of Eternal Stench. Help! Hold on. What did you have to go and do a thing like that for? - Do what? - Bleh! - You mean rescue you? - What? No. You kissed me. Oh, my gosh. Don't pretend to be so hard. I know you came back to help me, and I know that you're my friend. Did not. Am not. I just come to get me property back. Oh, and, uh... Give you, give you... Give me what? Ludo! Smell! Where's Hoggle? Get off of me! Oh, here. Hoggle. Oh, no, it's okay. This is Ludo. He's a friend too. A what? Smell! You're right. Oh, my God. There's a bridge. Come on. Watch it. You step in this stuff and you'll stink forever. Stop! - Stop, I say. - Please, we have to get across. Without my permission, no one may cross. Please, I only have a little time left! We've gotta get out of this stench. Smell bad. - Stench? Of what speaketh thou? - This smell. - I smell nothing. - Oh, you're joking. But I live by my sense of smell. The air is sweet and fragrant... ...and none may pass without my permission! Smell bad. Oh, get out of my way! I warn thee, I'm sworn to do my duty! - Come on. Let us get across. - Hold! Listen, I don't want to have to hurt you. Hoggle, what are you doing? Let go of my staff, sir! Ow! All right, then. I can conquer this mountain. Ow! Thou must do better than that. Give up? Huh? Woo! Woo, woo, woo! - Enough! - Huh? Before this day, never have I met my match in battle. Yet this noble knight has fought me to a standstill. - Are you all right, Ludo? - Smell! Sir Ludo, if that's thy name, now I, Sir Didymus, yield to thee. Come, let us be brothers henceforth... ...and fight for the right as one! - Thank you very much. - Ludo get brother. Steady. - Well met, Sir Ludo. - Good. Come on. Wait a minute! You forget my sacred vow, my lady. - I cannot let you pass. - But you just said Ludo is your brother. I have taken an oath, and I must defend it to the death. - The smell! - Okay. Let's handle this thing logically. What exactly have you sworn? I have sworn with my lifeblood no one shall pass this way... ...without my permission. Well, may we have your permission? Well, I, uh... - Yes? - Thank you, noble sir. My lady. - Uh-oh. - Have no fear, sweet lady. This bridge has lasted for a thousand years. No! - It seemed solid enough. - Hoggle! Fear not, fair maiden. I will save thee. Somehow. Sir Ludo, canst thou sit by and howl when yon maiden needs our help? - That's incredible, Ludo. - My brother! Canst thou summon up the very rocks? Sure. Rocks friends. Hoggle. - Here. - Thanks, Hoggle. Be careful, Ludo. Sir Ludo, wait for me. Ambrosius. It's all right, Ambrosius. You can come out now. Come on. Thattaboy. My loyal steed. Steady. Forward. Steady, steady, boy. Come on, Ambrosius. Just close your eyes and go. Let's get out of here. Excuse us. Thank you. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Oh, please, I can't give it to her. Well, come on, then. We'll reach the castle well before day. Look, Sarah, is this what you're trying to find? So much trouble over such a little thing, but not for long. She'll soon forget all about you, my fine fellow. Just as soon as Hoggle gives her my present... ...then she'll forget everything. Is that my stomach or yours, Ambrosius? Hungry. Yeah. Well, we can't stop now. Maybe we can find some berries or something. Sarah. Yeah? Here. Hoggle. Oh, thank you! You're a lifesaver. This tastes strange. - Hoggle, what have you done? - Oh, damn you, Jareth. And damn me too. Everything's dancing. Yea, verily. Whoa, Ambrosius, whoa! The castle doth lie yonder, my lady. My lady? My lady? My lady? Oh. She'll never forgive me. What have I done? I've lost my only friend. That's what I've done. What was I doing? Ew. Ugh. Ow. Get off my back! Why don't you look where you're going... ...young woman, hm? - I was looking. - Huh? Huh? And where were you going, hm? I don't remember. You can't look where you're going if you don't know where you're going. I was searching for something. Well, look here. Ooh. Lancelot? Thank you. That's what you were looking for. Wasn't it, my dear? Yes. I forgot. Now, why don't you... ...come in here... ...and see if there's anything else... ...you'd like. Hm? It was just a dream. I dreamed it all, Lancelot. But it was so real. Let's go see if Daddy's back, okay? Better to stay in here, dear. Yes. There's nothing you want out there. No! Oh, no. Ooh, what have we got here? Lancelot. Oh, your little bunny rabbit. You like your little bunny rabbit. Don't you? Yes, yes, yes. There you go. Ooh, and there's Betsy Boo. You remember Betsy Boo, don't you? Yes, yes, yes. Now, then, what else have we got? What's this? Ooh, let's have a look. It's a pencil box. Got lots of pencils in it too. Here's your panda slippers. You know how much you like your panda slippers. You never wanted them thrown away. There they are. That's right. That's right. Okay. Now, then, what else? Oh, it's little Horsy. You love little Horsy, don't you, dear? And look at this! You got a printing game, you have. Oh, here's a treasure. You'll want that. Won't you, my dear? Yes, go on. Put it on. Make yourself up. And here's dear old Flopsy. You'll want her, right? There you go. Oh, yes. Ah. Oh, yes. Charlie Bear. Right. There's Charlie Bear for you. There was something I was looking for. Don't talk nonsense. It's all here. Everything in the world you've ever cared about is all right here. Look, there's your little toy candy shop. "Through dangers untold... ...and hardships unnumbered... ...I fought my way here to the castle... ...beyond the Goblin City... ...to take back the child that you have stolen." Huh? Huh? What's the matter, my dear? Don't you like your toys? It's all junk. Well, what about this? This is not junk, eh? Yes, it is! I have to save Toby! My lady! - Sarah. Sarah. - Are you all right? - My lady. - Sarah. Fair maiden. Thank goodness thou art safe at last. - Where are we? - Sarah back. My lady, look, we're almost there. Those are the gates to the Goblin City. Ludo, Sir Didymus. Let's go quickly. We don't have much time. - Yeah. - Right, Ambrosius. Forward. No, no! Open up. Open the door. Shh. Sir Didymus, we must go quietly. Open up. Open up right now! Sir Didymus, you'll wake the guard. Quiet. Well, let them all wake up! - Shh. - I shall fight you all to the death! Please, Sir Didymus, for my sake, hush. But of course. For thee, anything. - But I'm not a coward? - No. - And my sense of smell is keen? - Oh, yes. Then I shall fight anyone anywhere, any place, anytime! Yes, yes, we know, we know! Now, hush. Quietly. Ambrosius, be quiet, now. I don't see why we have to be so quiet. It's only a Goblin City. I smell trouble. Come on, Ludo. Oh, no. What is that? Who goes? Who goes? Who goes? Watch out! Ambrosius! Ambrosius, will you come here. Ambrosius, come here right now! Will you please come. Oh, but you're embarrassing me. Careful, Ludo. - Hoggle! - Huh? Look out! Get out of there. What are you doing? Bombs away! That wasn't very nice. My turn now. How do you drive this thing? Drop the ax! I'm trying. Come here at once. Where's reverse? Get out of there, Hoggle! Abandon ship. Hoggle! Hoggle, are you all right? I'm not asking to be forgiven. I ain't ashamed of nothing I did. Jareth made me give you that peach. I don't care what you think of me. I told you I was a coward. And I ain't interested in being friends. I forgive you, Hoggle. You...? You do? And I commend you. Rarely have I seen such courage. You are a valiant man, Sir Hoggle. I am? Hoggle and Ludo friends. We are? Here are your things, Hoggle. Thanks for your help. Well, what are we waiting for? Let's get the rat who calls himself Jareth. Right. Come on. Ambrosius, it's safe now. Nothing to be afraid of. Your Highness! Your Highness. Your Highness, the girl... - What? - The girl who ate the peach... - ...and forgot everything... - What of her? She's here with the monster, Sir Didymus and the dwarf who worked for you. - What? - They got through the gates... ...and they're on their way to the castle! Stop her! Call out the guards. Take the baby and hide it. - Guards! - She must be stopped. Do something! Come on, move. Move! - I think we're gonna make it. - Oh, piece of cake. Company, halt. Lances ready! Cannon, fire! Ambrosius, turn around. Ambrosius, turn about. - Quick, this way. - All right. Charge! No, not that way! You're going the wrong way! The battle's behind us! Ambrosius, can we please talk about this? Sit! Be careful. Okay. Through here. Ambrosius, stand still. Okay, come on, guys. Ambrosius, if you don't turn around this second... ...I will never feed you again. That's better. Don't worry, Ambrosius. I think we've got them surrounded. Didymus! Where's Didymus? Fire! I hit something, yes? No? We've got to find Didymus. Down this way. Charge! Tallyho! Ah! Ambrosius, you coward. Ambrosius! Quick, in here. How's Ludo gonna get in? You in there, you're surrounded! Surrounded? Get out! Ludo, call the rocks! Huh? - Take that! - Hungry? Ludo! Ambrosius, unlock this door. So had enough, have you? All right, then, throw down your weapons, and I'll see that you're well treated. Hi-yah! Ludo! Next time, surrender. Good grief! Steady, men. Steady, men. Hold your ground. Okay, I take it back. Run for your lives! I've had enough! I'm going to bed. Get out of my house! Whoa, Nellie! Duck! Missed! Okay, come on. Fire! Hey, I just fired you. Ouch, ouch, ouch. This way. Now we have you! And now you don't. Hey, no problem. - Sir Didymus! - Coming! Hi-ho, Silver! - Whoa, boy. Whoa, fella. - This way. Steady, boy. Ah, yes. Up you go. Up, up. Come on. Good boy. Come on. No. Good boy. Come on. - That's the only way he could've gone. - Well then, come on. No, no. I have to face him alone. - But why? - Yes. Because that's the way it's done. Well, if that is the way it is done... ...then that is the way you must do it. But should you need us... Yes, should you need us... I'll call. Thank you, all of you. Toby! Toby! Toby. Toby. Give me the child. Sarah, beware. I have been generous up until now, and I can be cruel. Generous? - What have you done that's generous? - Everything! Everything that you wanted, I have done. You asked that the child be taken. I took him. You cowered before me. I was frightening. I have reordered time... ...I have turned the world upside down... ...and I have done it all for you. I am exhausted from living up to your expectations of me. Isn't that generous? Through dangers untold and hardships unnumbered... ...I have fought my way here to the castle beyond the Goblin City. For my will is as strong as yours... - ...and my... - Stop. Wait. Look, Sarah. Look what I'm offering you. Your dreams. And my kingdom as great. I ask for so little. Just let me rule you... ...and you can have everything that you want. Kingdom as great. Damn. I can never remember that line. Just fear me, love me, do as I say... ...and I will be your slave. My kingdom as great. My kingdom as great. You have no power over me. You have no power over me. Toby. Toby! Toby. Toby. Here you are. I'd like Lancelot to belong to you now. We're home. Sarah, are you home? Yeah. Yes, I'm home. Goodbye, Sarah. And remember, fair maiden... ...should you need us... Yes, should you need us... ...for any reason at all... I need you, Hoggle. You do? I don't know why, but... ...every now and again in my life... ...for no reason at all, I need you. - All of you. - Uh... You do? Well, why didn't you say so? - Ludo! - Sarah. Ambrosius, good boy, good boy. I say, does anyone here want to play a game of Scrabble? - You remind me of the babe. - What babe? - The babe with the power. - What power? - The power of voodoo. - Who do? - You do. - Do what? Remind me of the babe.
