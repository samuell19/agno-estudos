Really he said. Such laws do exist. You can find the section 49-P on Google with a mobile phone. But no one knows the existence of Section 49-P.

The hearing was brought forward .. - Do not just standing alone! - Go an eye! - I'll check. Because of you, more than 2000 people .. sopand every area asked to vote again. They did not ask to vote for 're' Your Honor. They actually still have not voted yet. He does not understand our language. Elections were unconstitutional shall be considered invalid. Elections must be held! Re-election is not a joke. It involves a lot of work. Do you know how expenses will be issued? To catch a thief who stole 1,000 rupees .. ..pihak police will spend 10,000 rupees. If you only think to save 9,000 rupees .. sopand will continue to be a lifelong thief, Your Honor. This is not the time to think spending. But the time to save the people. What do you think the Election Commission? When he said his vote was made illegally .. ..we gave him the right to vote again. But many people came forward and claimed that their votes were stolen. We can not just let him alone be able to vote .. ..and deny the rights of others. Nearly two thousand people in each area who filed the case. There are some areas that wins the majority of votes between 800-1500. This is an opportunity to change it. Not only that, Yang Arif. Votes made illegally have also been included in the vote count. How do you separate them? Or even to reduce it? In the Tamil Nadu elections in 2016 .. ..just made 2,60,000 votes to .. ..membezakan winners and losers. But this time the person who filed the case over 3,45,000.

Hey, show him the tomatoes! Sir, this is the tomato. Mindless! I want to tell you an interesting story about the crime that these tomatoes? In seven countries across the world .. ..sos made of tomato us .. ..dinikmati with full of fun. Tomato growing on our land, have tremendous demand worldwide. But there is one big mystery. People who grow tomatoes, always just die here. You know why? The amount of tomatoes that are grown here .. ..suku of the total left to rot .. ..and will be discarded in the trash. Suppose they both have 55kg of tomatoes per person. Although there is high demand, ..I will only buy tomatoes with one of them. I will not buy tomatoes from another man .. ..walau else I need it. The life expectancy of tomatoes it? Only two days. I do not know who will be damaged tomato ago, both the seller will always feel afraid. Now, prices are based on prices offered by manufacturers sauce. He would buy tomatoes worth 40 rupees only 6 rupees. It was he bought with a salesperson alone. Tomatoes are available on another vendor .. ..akan damaged and will eventually be thrown in the trash. Foreign families in other countries in the world enjoy a meal with tomato sauce .. ..manakala our farm families here .. ..bunuh themselves and die. So, next time if we want to throw a tomato .. ..we think farmers who grow these plants. Why is this? Why silent all the time? If you messing with me, go ahead. - Sir, I have questions. - Ask. During the elections, sometimes we voted for an excitement only. There are times when we will be able to vote for a fee. But why would you want to bother just because of one vote? You already know that section 49-P that exists. You topple the government. You resign. Why do all this? I want to tell the real reason? Come on! Come on! My hometown is Rameswaram. Try living among poverty in the land and sea forces as well. ..keluarga we were among the hundreds of fishing families. There is no guarantee to return alive after going fishing. Families of those who died at sea will be abandoned. Hunger affects all families. Then, there is an election. We do not believe all the candidates. Without a vote, they go to sea. My uncle went with them. Elections took place when they were at sea. The politician who has been in power for 5 years. But, the people? They only powerful one day. Realizing their mistake go into the sea at that time .. ..they tried to return. And at that moment .. ..tentera neighbors and fishermen who shot my father was innocent. In that attack, my father .. Together with my father .. 13 people .. ..terkorban. Those who survived the attack, trying to bring the wounded to the beach .. ..but my father who was shot to say .. .. "Do not take me back to the land" "Preparing for the funeral will cost 2000 rupees" "My kids can eat for 2 years with my money .." "Jadi.." "Bring my body .." "And throw it in the ocean," he cried. When he breathed his last breath .. ..they measles body. To the ocean. Always heard, the measles remains in the sea .. But this time my father was thrown. And the person who wins the elections did not do anything! Fishermen's associations to fund learning my mother. My mother studied and became a school teacher. And he forced us to learn! I learned of a crazy kid. More intensely than ever. I attended every interview is coming! No matter the city and country where I was, I always go back. For elections. Some people asked me was not it? Have you eaten rice and salt? You know! I'm fishing! Salt is in the air that I breathe. Sorry. In this meeting .. None of you are not from Chennai ... How many of you have come from outside? Raise your hand. How many people who want to return home? Why do not you go home? They all came here to escape from hunger there! You of Rameswaram. I'm from Pudhukottai. I really wanted to go back. But people come here because of the hydrocarbons. How can I go back? I'm from Tirunelveli. Problems usurer! I'm from Chengalpet. Problems wages! I am from Thanjavur! Methane problem.

One day, they have to answer all of these! What do you say? Could you please repeat? One day, they have to answer all of these! When you ask them questions? Without asking, how are you going to answer? Write every problem they call on paper. I would ask that question! The Chief Minister Masilamani! I would ask those who have the power .. ..bila they will solve this problem, right now. From here keep to it. Lord, Lord! We can not go there now, sir. Mr. Masilamani were at the party. Not saved if only go there now. If I decided to ask, then I would do it immediately! Then, we will follow you. We will participate once. We all will follow once! We all will follow once!

He came riding a motorcycle. I'm a top man! Coming soon strike back! Fikrilah twice before attacking! Get out! Let it get some air! One shot will make you apart from me! Do it! Do not you dare turn merenungku and strength! When someone opposes, it's just a sign of progress! I lealki top. I'll turn on the axis! Planting a tree would cause rain, they say! Fraud is this? Is Ocean lined with trees? Rain did not go down there! When I told them my word stupid. Why not print money 5,000 or 10,000 or 20,000? You do not know whether it is productivity? Is this not the party leader and pioneer in productivity? What is this? I want to join a political party? Or did you come to know you're gonna want to go back there? I have not come for that reason. I came to ask questions. You dare me up on the stage .. ..and asked me the question huh? Can you see how many are there? If I say a word .. There was no need to say anything. If I give the signal .. ..di here, they will pull your limbs one by one! This is a major issue 32 of 32 regions. People in poor condition and difficult. If you made the announcement at the microphone and promised .. ..yang you'll finish after the elections. I will withdraw from the contest. Easy. If you're scared, admitted alone and get out of here. Rather than write a letter mcam school boy. I read tamil. Luckily I learned. What is it all about? What we back up every time elections for 30 years .. wrote damning piece of paper in half this? If we make this right, no more poverty! If there is no poverty, people will receive money for mengundikah? They have to steal for food! They must suffer stomach .. ..and their ears will hear a famine. Then, by 5000 that we give .. ..they will come like a dog for our vote. How are you going to understand all this? Take it! Not. You've misunderstood. They can withstand hunger and poverty only temporarily. In addition, if you touch their dignity .. You remember? "Jallikattu" (Events tame cattle) Sister .. In Tamil Nadu there are only two major political parties .. One of them is me. And another, who was on a microphone that. Now he's come together in such a united party and my party. Now I have full majority! So, if people want to vote in anger once .. ..they will give 100 votes to soap symbol .. ..or 200 lots for brush symbol. That is all! If the majority is more than ever before, so it can be resolved quickly! You're crazy! With the money I get from all this, I have to buy them! 234 ahli MLA .. ..and 36 ministers! The source of their income .. ..dari paper in your hand. What you can accomplish .. ..With against me only in one area alone? My party will rule shortly .. ..and the only dissenter. Is not it somewhat unique? Now I get it. I get it that you are not the political machinery .. ..but just a small wheel at the enterprise.

What mistake did they do? From where they can be nerve to kill people like that? They do not consider us human! But only the votes they have paid for! The money that we receive and that we make the vote .. .. I made them so arrogant! In a country of this size, only 45% - 50% of the vote. 10% is paid voters! 5% is illegal vote! 5% is to exchange gifts! Only 20% of 100%, which determine who will govern. Is this democracy?

Without the support of the party you are running as independents .. ..and win as a team. Who among you are chosen as chief minister? 210 ahli MLA .. 210 symbols. It's a surprise. Who is the Chief Minister? That's the next question. Once again, 209 people need at a glance. The most qualified will be selected. I say 209 because .. ..I will not be a part of it. The mind does not want any opposition is a threat to democracy. I'll be on the other side. Opposition! As anyone who asks! This decision was made after thinking about it. It is final. Among you there are former employees of the District, Mr. Sarkunam, IAS. I nominate him as Chief Minister. We only have 14 days. It all became a reality because of young children. If you go to another country .. ..and asked who are willing to shed blood and soul of the community .. They will appoint someone to live 30 or 40 years ago. But, if we ask the same questions today in Tamil Nadu .. The answer is, "Young people who shed their blood in this year" Those who gave their lives last month. Although it is an agonizing .. ..I feel very proud.
