[MUSIC PLAYS "WHEN JOHNNY COMES MARCHING HOME AGAIN"] ALL: [SINGING] When Johnny comes marching home again, hooray! Hooray! We'll give him a hearty welcome then, hooray! Hooray! The men will cheer, the boys will shout, the ladies, they will all turn out, and we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home. When Johnny comes marching home again, hooray! Hooray! We'll give him a hearty welcome then, hooray! Hooray! The men will cheer, the boys will shout, the ladies, they will all turn out, and we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home. The old church bell will peel with joy, hooray! Hooray! We'll welcome home our darling boy, hooray! Hooray! The village lads and lassies say with roses they will strew the way, and we'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home. [laughter and clapping] It's you Westerners that's gonna decide this election. Take my advice, stick to Brian and free silver. Look at that bucktooth grin. Teddy Roosevelt ain't smiling at you, he's laughing at you. Teddy Roosevelt, the eastern millionaire. Out to rule the country. That's why he played cowboy. That's way he played soldier. Now he's playing politician. Wait a minute. We served under Colonel Roosevelt, and we know him. And he's the greatest man alive today. What's he done to prove it? Rounded up a bunch of hoodlums, the Rough Riders? And then followed them up San Juan Hill. Now don't worry, Roy. We got plenty of fighting to do in Arizona and we get paid for it. Come on, soldier. Come on. SOLDIER:[SHOUTING] Let me at him! Let me at him! Let me at him! [train bell clangs] SOLDIER: [SHOUTING] Let me at him! Let me at him! MAN: We can't go back! SOLDIER:[SHOUTING] Let me at him! [train whistles] [horse hooves] Howdy, soldier! I'm Jim Horn. Glad to know you, Jim. My name's Rogers. Where do I deliver this? I'll take it in. Thanks, neighbor. What kind of a skipper you got? How's he stand with the boys? Well, if he's got a soft spot, we ain't found it yet. You'll get a square deal and that's all. Fair enough. Fair enough. Colonel Roosevelt speaks very well of you. The border patrol needs good men, but let me warn you. This is not the army, and you're not under the eyes of an officer all the time. Therefore, you will be held responsible for your own discipline while on duty. You'll be inducted into the service in the regular way. That's all. Three Bar Ranch was raided last night, sir. Two men from the line camp killed. My partner's taking charge of the bodies. This is the only evidence we've found. We've picked up a trail of about 100 steers and a number of horses and followed them to the Mexican border. Looks like Arizona Jack's work all right. Get my horse. Now that sounds mighty interesting. Who is this Arizona Jack? Bandit leader with more brains than most. Nose that does it like a coyote. He finds his loot on our side and he shot her across the line. We know the breed. Down in Cuba but we call them the Buscadaros. And when we ran him down, we usually found out they'd been paying off to the local law man. Guess again, soldier. That Mexican head man down at Suarez is straight as a die. All the gold mines in his state couldn't buy Don Enriquez. And all of Arizona Jack's bandits couldn't buffalo him, neither. That guy must be all right, huh? Coburn, you take charge. I'm going over across the border and have a talk with Don Enriquez. This Arizona Jack has got to be stopped before he loots the entire border. [SPANISH ACCENT] Senior Harrison, it is impossible to run down a man that nobody knows. A man nobody can even describe. We have done our best, but-- Then we'll join forces. I'll bring my patrol over, and between us, we'll check every hole in your district until we smoke him out. Si, but the Captain forgets the little technicalities of the border. In the present state of international tension, I doubt if we can get permission for you to enter Mexico with an armed force. Permission or no, an imaginary line isn't going to stop the border patrol. But senior, if you cross that line without the proper authority, it will be the grand excuse all the fire brands in your land and my land have been waiting for. This murderer, even if he is the worst outlaw on the border, it is not worth going to war over him. All right. Then I'll get the authority from my own government. And when I do, I'm coming down here whether you like it or not. Good day, sir. [telegraph clicking] Post this where the men can see it when they come off duty. Yes, sir. Hello, Joe. Howdy. Any sign of Arizona Jack? No, sir. It looks like he's still on the other side of the border. Well, if he shows up, I want you immediately. Where are you planning on spending your night's leave? We generally do our relaxing at the Pilani Cantina. Well, while you're there, keep your eye open for an American girl. About 20, well-dressed. She's supposed to be headed for the border. We have routine orders to detain and hold her. That's all. About 20, you say? Yeah. That'll be a pleasure. Yes, siree! Hi ho, Dinah! There ain't no long distance animal like a good mule! That mule must be half jackrabbit. The next time I want anything in a hurry from El Paso, I'll let you know, Rusty. All right, Roy. Cool them off and feed them the best you have, Juan. What'll you have, gents? Take him in the back room. Three Border Patrolmen just came in. What're you going to do, Moray? Nothing, kid. Tell your fortune, boys? Sure! Tell us about the future. We know all about the past. Heh heh. [shuffles cards] [shuffles cards] What'd you do that for? Looked like a cold deck to me, Tommy. Hello, sis. How's about a little drink? Well that burned my buttons. Just as I was getting ready for a shindig too. Leave it to Roy. We'll fix it up for you. Would you like to dance? Sure, I would. Meet my friend here. Go ahead. I'll sing you a song. Aren't you going to get down while we change horses? No, I don't so. How far we from the border? Not very far now. You better have your papers ready. You mean I have to have a passport to get across? You sure do, ma'am. Especially in these times. They're pretty particular. Well, I'm too tired to go on, anyway. Can I put up there for the night? Yes, ma'am. That's what it's there for. Thank you. ROGERS: [SINGING] Through the rhythm of the pouring rain, it's been a dream come true when the sun shines through and I'm riding across the plane. From the mountains of Mexico echoes a sweet refrain, to the rhythm away we go over the Texas plain. Riding down the trail while I listen to the coyotes wail, it's a thrill to be where a man is free and he's riding down the trail. [YODELING] [YODELING] [clapping] Young American girl, about 20. To be detained and held. You detain her and I'll hold her. If she's the right one. [SPANISH ACCENT] Will the senorita have dinner? Yes, and a room. And tomorrow, I will need a horse and a guide. And will you please get this on the stagecoach before it leaves? It's very important. Si. You wait here, I come soon, eh? I'll check up on her. Ramone, What was the young lady asking you? She wanted a horse and a guide for the border. Pardon, I must get this on a stagecoach. I'll take it. Good evening, miss. The hotel keeper tells me you'd like to hire a guide. Why, yes. Where do you want to go to? Across the border. You see, there's some sort of a silly rule about a passport, and I, I lost mine. You understand? What would you do if you run into a Border Patrolman? Oh I'd find some way to handle him. You see, they're only interested in smugglers and people of that sort. Not somebody like me. But they are. In fact, they have orders to detain you. How do you know? Why, you're not a-- Yes. I'll have to ask you to come along to headquarters. You're name, please, miss? Give me that letter. I'm sorry, miss. [coachman yells to horses] [horse hooves] Well, if I have to go with you, let's get it over with. I'm sorry, miss. What, again? You're the sorriest thing I've seen since I left Denver. We have no means of transportation. We'll have to wait until the stage comes in from Mexico. It should be at the border now. [telephone rings] [SPANISH ACCENT] Hello? Rogers? I get him. They want you on the telephone. Patrolman Rogers reporting, sir. Sorry to spoil your leave, Rogers, but you men have got to go back on duty immediately. You'll take charge of the stage from Mexico when it arrives at the cantina and convoy it to the railroad. There's $60,000 in gold aboard. Yes, sir. And by the way, we've picked up that girl you wanted. We'll put her on the stagecoach and drop her off at headquarters when we go back. All right. Those Patrolmen are going to be on the stage when it pulls out. We'd better take care of them here. I've got a way. How's about a dance? Come on, let's-- Hey, stop it! I don't want no fight in my cantina! Fight? Heh. Well, there ain't no fight in them coppers. They're nothing but a bunch of tax collectors, anyhow. [woman screams] [woman screams] [shouting] [shouting] Please, I want to go with you. All right. What's going on in there? It's a fight. Hurry up and chain that team, men. Giddy-up! Giddy-up! G Giddy-up! Look out, Roy! [gunshot] [woman screams] The stage has already left. We've got to run it down. [telephone rings] Patrol headquarters. A fight? Who started it? [SPANISH ACCENT] Uh. Rogers. Start the fight over a girl. Hold that stage. Don't let it go until I get there. [SPANISH ACCENT] It's too late! The stage already vamos! Stay here and take care of him. I've got to get after that stage. Take over 'til I get back. [coachman urging horse on] [gunshots] [gunshots] [horses running] [gunshots] [gunshots] [gunshot] Get that express box. [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] They followed him to the border, sir. But your orders were not to cross into Mexican territory. Very good. I'm glad I've some men that can obey orders. But Captain Harris, Roy wasn't to blame. He was on duty. Do you realize the results of that fight? No. Two civilians dead. A patrolmen seriously wounded. A robbery. An escaped prisoner. And Arizona Jack out of our reach across the border. Hm. From the railroad hospital: Patrolman Thomas Warden died on the operating table. You boys weren't entirely responsible. There were extenuating circumstances. And in view of your good records, I'm not going to suspend you from duty. We're not asking for any favors. Then you are suspended under charges. I'll let you know when to report for the hearing. That's all. [badges clink on desk] I knew something like this was gonna happen. But I don't know why you have to make it worse. Would you rather have your badge or a chance to go after the men who murdered Tommy? Oh, I get it. You forced the old man's hand. And made him suspend us. Now they can go after those fake Mexicans across the border. And they won't fool us this time. Yeah, they'll be looking for Americans in Mexican outfits. Right. [inaudible] just phoned. He says every effort is being made to recover our shipment. He feels sure his men will catch Arizona Jack this time. Oh, he couldn't catch flies. Here he comes. Who? Hello, Lenny. Here's your split for last night's job. Why bring it to me here? Cause that ain't all I got. That's why. There was a girl, too. A girl? She had a letter in her purse from you. Her name is Dorothy Blair. She's your boss's daughter, ain't she? Yes. How much do you think she's worth? In cash. You can't do that. Why not? You don't know Blair. If he comes down here and finds his daughter missing, he'll tear the border apart. Now leave it to me and we'll get more money out of the old boy then you expect. But how am I going to turn loose of her without tipping off that you and I are together in this gold robbery racket? You could leave a good horse conveniently around so she could escape. She'd get lost in the desert. Not if you told somebody to give her directions on how to reach the mine. I guess you're right. The old lady that's riding herd on her could do that. Now get out of here before you're seen. What took so long? [horse hooves leaving] Something unexpected happened last night. Dorothy Blair was on that stage. What is she doing down here? How should I know? She's always quarreling with her father and threatening to run away. You got to know her pretty well while you were visiting there, didn't you? -Well, yes. That's likely the reason she's here, to tell me her troubles and get sympathy. You've been writing to her. Of course not. We're on their trail, all right. Let's ride to the top and see what's ahead. Whoa, Dinah. There's no telling what's only the other side of that ridge. That ghost town would make a good hideout, Roy. It might be worth looking into. Look. Drat that Dinah. If there's anybody down there, they might have seen me. Well that's a chance we've got to take. [many voices] Hey, Mosby! A [inaudible] with a riding mule was scouting us from the top of the ridge. Oh yeah? Let's take a look around. It sure looks deserted. Don't let it fool you. You've got to be careful. Stick 'em up! -So, you didn't get enough, huh? -Hold it. Up with 'em! All right, boys, take them in the back room and lock them up until our boss gets here. All right. Come on, you. Get on. Get! Guess that will hold 'em, boys. I bet it will. DOROTHY : Who's there? Who's there, answer me. Looks like this scrape she's in ain't taught her no manners yet. She's still giving orders. What do you know about me? Plenty. We're the Border Patrolmen. Well, why didn't you say so? Get me out of here. Listen lady. Chances are that none of us will get out of here alive. Who are you and what're you doing down here, anyway? Very clever, aren't you? Trying to scare me into telling you so you can wire my father and have him come down here and take me home. The trouble with you is you've been reading the wrong kind of novels. And this happens to be a true story. Them two Patrolmen that were in the cantina last night came sneaking around while you were away. You still got 'em? Yeah, Shoved them in the back room and locked them up. Well get rid of them. But we've got to get rid of the girl first. [guitar music] Mr. Patrolmen? Please, do you really think we're in danger? Well, this Arizona Jack is no gentlemen. I know of three men he knocked off yesterday. Well, then maybe I better tell you. Are you listening? We're listening. Then stop that strumming. Oh no. I wouldn't think of letting you tell your whole life story without music. Oh, all right. I suppose you think I'm a silly little girl running around trying to cause a lot of trouble. But I'm not. I have business down here. You see, I was coming down to marry Mr. Lanning, the manager of the Amco Gold Mine. Well, why didn't you keep going? Because I didn't have a passport. That was the reason I was writing to Mr. Lanning. By the way, what did you do with my letter? Forgot it. Oh, if you'd only had sent it, why, Mr. Lanning would know something had happened to me, and by this time have all his men after us. Riding days are happy days on the rolling plains. Swaying in the saddle all day long. In my heart I find the song here on the range with you. Clouds of gray, they fade away, and it never rains. The sun is always shining from above. And I find the life I love here on the range with you. The yellow moon that rolls along up yonder will always keep shining bright to light our trails wherever we may wander over the rolling plains at night. Riding down the Western trails under skies of blue, swaying in the saddle all day long, life will always be a song here on the range with you. It has nothing to do with music, of course, but I just saw your bandits riding away. I wonder what that means. Meaning no good, I'll bet. [SPANISH ACCENT] Come quickly. I'll let you get away while they are gone. All three of us? Oh no, not the men. I should be killed for that. But I can't go away and leave them here. Quit arguing. You would waste time. Go ahead! If you consider yourself a waste of time, all right. Put this on. Go on. Go on. Which way to the Amco Mine? That way. Gracias, senior! Gracias! What do you make of that? There's only one answer. You mean Arizona Jack's got religion? What are you doing here? Well, you didn't think I'd leave you here to be killed, did you? Well they'll see your horse and we'll all be killed. No, they won't. I left him back in the aroya. Nobody saw me. Now you're wasting time. Come on. -All right. You go back to your horse and keep going. We'll catch up with you later. You find our horses and bring them here. I'll get some guns. [gun clatters to the floor] [gunshot] [SHOUTING] Hey! Tie it off. Well, what are you waiting for? Get after them! Well, I see you got away. Sure. We lost them fellers an hour ago. Come on, let's get a drink. Hey, you ain't gonna drink this, are you? No, but the horses would like to have a little. Well, it can't be much further to the mine now, so if you don't mind, I'll go on alone. Oh, but we do mind. Why do we? Because we're still responsible for her. [ANNOYED] Oh! Just how well you know this man, Lanning? Well you don't think I'd come down here all the way to marry a stranger, do you? You're about the only girl in the whole world who would do a thing like that. Well, all right. George Lanning is American, white, and over 21, and a very successful engineer. Now do you approve? How successful? Well, Dad says he runs our mine efficiently and Dad doesn't like him. You still haven't told me what kind of a man he is. Well, I would say he's the most wonderful man in the world. Well, I hope so. What is this? A meeting of the Border Guardians? What's the idea, knocking Lanning? You ain't got a Chinaman's chance, Roy. She's as good as hitched to him right now. Would you like to make a little bet on that? Who's wasting time now? Come on. But Mr. Blair, it isn't my fault your daughter ran away. It is your fault! You made love to her when you were with us in Denver. And you've probably been writing to her ever since. But I-- I-- I-- Oh, don't bother to lie about her. I don't care if you did or you didn't. I want my daughter. Where is she? I told you, I don't know. Well then, find her! Why don't you do something? [horse hooves] [horse hooves] Oh, I forgot. You're mad at me for running away, aren't you? I certainly am. But I guess you wouldn't have done it if I hadn't have made you so doggone mad. But I'm still going to marry George. Well, if you think that much of him, go ahead. I don't care what you do. What I want to know is what happened? Who are these, uh-- Oh, it's all very simple. I was captured by bandits and these Border Patrolmen rescued me. Roy, Rusty, meet my father, Mr. Blair, and Mr. Lanning. Glad to know you, Mr. Blair. But we didn't rescue your daughter. No. She rescued us. Oh, that's very likely. But it doesn't sound so simple to me. Say, what about a drink while we talked it over? Yeah-- I'm sorry, sir, but we're still on duty. Oh, Roy! Then come back later? Thank you. We will. And I just remembered something important that I have to attend to at the office. I'll be right back. What do you mean, "We're on duty?" We're still responsible for that girl. You couldn't stop them wedding bells from ringing now if you could cut the rope. What happened? Now, don't worry. I've got the old boy eating out of my hand. What about the girl? Well, she's had a rough time of it, but neither one of them blame me. You know what I mean. What about her and you? She doesn't mean a thing to me. We want to see Mr. Lanning. His office is right in there. Well, gentlemen. Is there any practical way in which I can express my appreciation for what you've done for Ms. Blair? There certainly is, Mr. Lanning. Of course, we know where Arizona Jack's hideout is, but if we're going to catch him, we've got to have more men. Oh yes, that's true. It's, uh, too late today, but I'll have all the men you need in the morning. Are you sure you have everything figured out? Just about. Everything. Except why Arizona Jack paid off that old squaw to help that girl get away. Say do you suppose he could have been playing up [GASPS] somebody? All right, Mr. Lanning, we'll be back in the morning. Oh, Harry, saddle my horse and bring him around front. I got you, Roy. I got you. Got what? Why you kicked me in there. I sure let the cat out of the bag to Lanning, didn't I? Whatever got into you, poppin' off like that? I thought you were wise. I know that I shouldn't have them wisdom teeth pulled out. Well, that's all right, Rusty. You're usually way ahead of me. Thanks, Roy. Thanks. [horse hooves] Working out like you said, Roy. He's heading for Soledad, all right. I want to speak to you alone. Get out. Now what do you want? How would you like to have half to gold you kicked back to Lanning? Go on. I'm through with him. Why? He thinks he's going to marry Mr. Blair's daughter. But I'm not going to let him. When I get through talking, he'll be through with women for years. Suppose Lanning did marry into the Blair family. Looks like he'd be more valuable than ever, if you didn't talk. Where's Moray? Hello, Lenny. What's on your mind? All right, boys. Bring it in. Now look, Moray. Those Patrolmen saw you letting Ms. Blair escape and paying off the old lady for helping him. Yeah? Now one of them is smart enough to figure out that you wouldn't do that unless you were doing it for somebody who was interested in her. And that'd be you. That's right. They suspect us of being partners. Of course, he hasn't got a very strong case, but if he ever lays it before Blair and he starts investigating, I'm through. Who figured this out? Oh, the young one. The old one couldn't figure the time of day. Well, you're well fixed, anyway. How much gold do you got hidden in the mine? Oh, about $100,000 worth. $100,00 is a nice cut. You don't think very fast, Lenny. [gunshot] All right, come on. You asked for it. All right, saddle up. We're riding. And get the wagon ready. We're going to have company, and we're not coming back. All right, get moving! Roy, what do we do? Ride back to headquarters and get the Rough Riders. Bring them to the mine. I'll figure out some way to stall for time until you get there. How about Harrison? Oh, don't tell him. Hi ho, Dinah! Hey, you [inaudible]. Hello, Rusty. Roy's got a scrap all set for you down at the Amco mine! Yeah, but we can't go down there. Harrison's orders are not to cross the border. Aw, forget Harrison! Roy says its boots and saddles for all you Rough Riders. Come on! Get going. Come on. Rusty Coburn's taking all the Rough Riders over the border to the Amco Mine. RUSTY: Hi ho, Dinah! Saddle up. I've got to go down and straighten this thing out. Come along. Saddle up. I just came from the camp where they had us locked up. Arizona Jack and the whole outfit are on their way here to loot this place. Where's Mr. Lanning? If you can find anything that will shoot, grab it. Whoa. Now take a half a dozen men and get the gold. Rose will show you where it is. All right. The rest of you come with me. We can't hold out here! There's too many of them. All right, bring it in. Find that girl. [gunshots] [gunshots] [gunshots] All right, take cover. My patrol has crossed your border without authority. [SPANISH ACCENT] Why, senior? Rogers sent word that Arizona Jack is attacking the mine at Amco. Rogers? Yes, one of my Patrolman. Suspended from duty under charges. Apparently, he followed Jack down here. Now, I assure you. I didn't authorize those men to cross the border. In fact, it was against my orders. How many men? 11. Are they all good fighting men, senior? Yes, but-- One momentito. First, let us have a drink. [gunshots] We'll never get them this way. You come with me. Now the rest of you stay here and cover him. There's only three shells left. If they rush us, we're done for. [gunshots] I'm going to blow up the entrance and seal us in until help get's here. Isn't that pretty dangerous? It's our only chance. You and Dorothy get back as far you can. Follow the track until I overtake you. [gunshots] [gunshots] [gunshots] [gunshots] [explosion] [rocks falling] RUSTY: Hi ho, Dina! Looks like you're in this roundup too, sister. You'd better get down. [SPANISH ACCENT] Senior Harrison, you understand I am not too appear in this matter. And what will your report say? Without going into official details, it will say that the prisoners were caught red-handed with a stolen bullion from the Amco Mine. And where were they caught? It won't say. Well, as long as they were caught and Senior Blair has his gold, it doesn't matter. Yes, and I got something back far more valuable to me than the gold. Are you still worrying about Lanning? You win, Roy. Rogers? Coburn? The way things have turned out, the alcalde and myself are more than willing to overlook your recent, uh-- Irregularities. Yeah. That's all. Well, old boy, we'll see you again soon. Thank you, sir. [WHEN JOHNNY COMES MARCHING HOME PLAYS]
