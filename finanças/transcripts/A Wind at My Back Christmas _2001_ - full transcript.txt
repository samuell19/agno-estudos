(delightful music) (car horn blowing) - [Toppy] All right, Violet, one more time. - And then spoke the Lord to me, the angel of the Lord and thy did come down to Mary. - Mary, where's Mary? - I can read Mary. - Jim, are you listening? - Hmm, what? Oh, ah, yes of course. - It looks like Mary had to go home for dinner. So, let's call it a day. We have to work very hard in the next few weeks. But on Christmas Eve when we perform, the whole town will be proud. Now go on home, everyone. Jim, about the script. Some of the lines are a bit difficult for the children. - With a little more practice they'll be fine. - What I mean is, it needs to be rewritten. - Really? Which line? - All of it. - But it sounded fine to me. - Dialogue is supposed to sound like normal speech. - I am a science teacher, Toppy, not a writer. - I know, but will you try? - Fine. (sighs) - This is going to be dreadful. - Just like everything else in my life. - What are you talking about, your life is fine. - It's not. - What's the problem? - Boys. - At your age that's the only problem there is. Is it someone at school? - No! They're idiots. They think I'm nice enough to be friends with, but that's all. (sighs) - By the way, how are your studies going? - Fine. I got two more courses this morning. - Oh. - I only wish they weren't by correspondence. - [Toppy] You actually want to go to class with those young people? - Not young people, students. Reading the same books, thinking about important ideas, being able to talk with your professors, hear them lecture. Sometimes I'm so jealous of Hub, it's almost sinful. (laughs) It's hard on the family, but Max is being so helpful. - Speaking of Max, is he terribly busy these days? - Pretty busy, why? - It's the Christmas pageant. Jim Flett wrote the script, and believe me, he is not a dramatist. - Max isn't either. Not anymore. - But he was so good at it. You don't lose that kind of talent. - He's lost interest. At least that's what he says. (playful music) - Thank you, good night. - Oh, Max! - Good evening, Toppy. - You look like you've had a very tiring day. - Toppy, lately every day is tiring. - Well, I have just the thing to pick up your spirits, and just in time for the holidays. How would you like to write the script for our Christmas pageant? - I thought Jim Flett was doing that. - Well, I mean, rewrite his script. - Toppy, I don't have time! - Oh, but Max, it would be so much better. - Toppy, I'm the town mayor, I'm a teacher, I'm the principal, not to mention all the extra work at home with Honey's courses. I don't have any extra time for even the tiniest little thing. And rewriting a script, Toppy, is not a little tiny thing! (delightful music) (sighs) - Since when did you decide to become a cop? - When I started reading stories about the Mounties as a kid. Why doesn't anybody believe me? - Maybe 'cause you change your mind every other week. - If I was Hub, you'd all be writing letters to the head of the RCMP telling 'em I'd be the best Mountie in Canada. - That's because you can trust Hub. - You can trust me. - Not if you're a cop. Cops have to do dirty things like make people rat on their friends. - Not people, criminals. And just because your father was in jail. - So I don't like cops, sue me! - You know, I don't even know why I told you this. - I gotta go to rehearsal. I don't know why you told me either. (light music) - Max, the RCMP is recruiting, you get to go to Regina. - You don't need another excuse to avoid more school work, Fat. - It isn't! - Mommy, Zach won't sit still. - You wanted to be a chess master, then a garage mechanic, then a pilot. - This isn't like the other things. I wanted to be a Mountie for a really long time, I just- - Do you have any idea what the minimum requirements are? How old you have to be? What kind of education you need? - I'll find out! Because it's what I really wanna do. I'm going to apply. - No you're not! You're gonna concentrate on school for a change. You show me some half decent marks and next year when you're old enough, we'll see how you feel about the RCMP then. - But Max! - Mail's here! You got a letter from Hub and a card from Aunt Grace. And your school work. - That's fast. I just finished the last courses two weeks ago. Let's see what we've got. - [Grace Voiceover] What a macabre journey this has turned out to be. I keep asking myself why I came. Even if it was my husband's last wish for me to collect his remains, it feels like a lifetime ago that Van went off to fight the fascists in Spain and even longer since I married him. Mother's holding up well in spite of the chaos around us. It's as though the darkness of war has settled over Europe. Even though there is no war yet, the effects of it are everywhere. Tomorrow, we leave for Madrid. We're told that the fighting continues, even though Franco has won. But we've come this far, I cannot turn back. I will honor my husband despite my misgivings about him. We have to change our return passage. We expect to be in New Bedford by December 10th or 11th. We miss you all. Love to everyone. - Is that from Grace? - Oh, Maisey, I didn't know you were coming home for lunch. - Did they find his body yet? - They haven't even gotten to Spain, so they won't be home until mid-December. - Oh. That means you have to stay and look after me for even longer. - I know, you're too old to need a babysitter. - That's okay, Toppy. Did I get a letter from Hub? - Not today. (light music) - [Hub Voiceover] Dear Maisey, I'm sorry it's been so long since I've written. I've been studying hard and I made it through midterms without too much trouble. My friends here are aces. Father Fitzroy continues to be an inspiration to me, both as a spiritual and an academic advisor. University is a privilege, Maisey. I hope you have a similar opportunity, but not with the church necessarily. There's such interesting people here and I've been able to make fast friendships. - You are so sneaky, Hubert. - You have to be with those campus cops. - If they were clever, they'd follow behind us and tear down every sign we put up. - Yeah, but they're not clever. So what next? We can't put anymore posters outside today. - I thought you didn't care about getting caught. - Oh, I don't, I mean they're not real police. They could always give your name to the chairman of the music department and he could-- - Professor Coburn is my friend. He was against the Nazis since 1925 when Hitler published "Mein Kampf." - You're amazing, you know so much about everything. - I don't. (laughs) - You do, you know all about what's going on in Europe. - Because I'm from Vienna. - And you know about our immigration policies. - Because I'm an immigrant. - You help organize so many demonstrations that you never even go to. - Because I'm a music student. We work much harder than everyone else. - And you have answers for everything. - I think I know where to put the rest of the posters. - In here, they have strict rules against it. - That's why everyone will notice. Hurry up before someone sees. (elegant music) - Fifteen people for mass. What's the world coming to? - Well, everyone's tired from midterms. - It's no excuse. You turned up, didn't you? - I might not have if I wasn't in charge of the altar boys. - Don't pat yourself on the back yet, Hubert. And buttering me up won't make you a good priest. You won't be any kind of priest if you fail chemistry. - I don't see the relevance of chemistry to the spiritual life. - It's a lesson in obedience, which brings me to a related matter. Why are you consorting with all those anti-fascist ruffians on campus? - Oh, they're not ruffians, they're decent people who love charity and peace. - That's not what I heard. Everyone said you made quite a speech yesterday. - Word travels fast. - Watch out, Hubert. You could become a campus celebrity. Anyway, why make such a big deal over Hitler? - Well, he's already invaded Austria, he's moving into Czechoslovakia. This egomaniac plans to take over all of Europe. - He's a ridiculous buffoon who'll destroy himself long before anyone gets a chance to stop him. (graceful music) (applauds) - Professor Coburn, I didn't realize. Oh, it was terrible, the intonation was very poor. - You're too severe with yourself, Anna. Accept my praise. Listen carefully, I have to leave Toronto for a while. - Why? How long? - I don't know. - Where will you be? - It's better if you don't know that. If you need help, call this number. But only use it if you have to. Contacting them could be dangerous. - Why do you have to go? - My colleagues think we've been infiltrated. - Infiltrated, who would wanna infiltrate us? All we've done is organize a few little demonstrations. - I was just about to tell the professor that he's wrong. - Who do you think it is? - Mr. Bailey, you shouldn't creep up on people. - Oh, sir, I didn't mean to creep up on anyone. I was just-- - Ms. Schiller's right. Most reports of infiltrators are false rumors designed to create paranoia. I shouldn't have taken it seriously. I'm sure your recital will be excellent, Miss Schiller. I'll see you when I return. Good day. - What's wrong? Do you think there's an infiltrator? - No, I'm thinking about my recital. I have another piece to learn and it's a Bach courante and very difficult. - I'll keep you company for moral support. - Ah, Hubert. - I promise, I won't distract you. It's just I study better when you're around... When you're playing I mean. - You know, I think I play better when you're around too. (ardent music) (sighs) Sometimes I hate Bach. - As much as I hate chemistry? (laughs) - What shall we do? - Something wild. - Like? - Let's go have a beer. (laughs) - Let' find a dark, smoky jazz club and dance all night. - Only Toronto has one of those. - Excuse me. Are you Miss Anna Schiller? - Yes. - Inspector Wells, RCMP. Can I see your passport please? - Of course. - All right. Ludwig Schiller, that's your father. I'm sorry, am I saying that right? - Sir, isn't nine o'clock a little late to be checking people's papers? - What's your name, son? - Hubert Bailey. - Hubert Bailey. Could you give us a telephone number or an address for your father in Vienna? Could you write that down there please? Is something wrong? - No, it's just they told me they were moving and I don't know the new address. - Oh, I see. Do you know a Professor Walter Coburn? - Yes. - Did you have any contact with him before you came to Canada? - Only through my application to study here. - Have you seen him lately? - Not for a week or so. - Do you have any idea at all where he is? - Why, has he disappeared? - Miss Schiller? - I don't know. - Oh. Well, we'll be in touch then. Thank you. - What was that all about? Are you all right? - I'm fine. - You're upset. - No, I'm just tired. I practiced for five hours today. Come, let's have a beer. - Tell me why he scared you so much. - You look so serious, you scare me. We need to have some fun. Come, smile for me, Hubert. (celestial music) - Bless me, father, for I have sinned. It has been two weeks since my last confession. - Let's hear the list. - There's a girl, father. - I see. And have you acted on your feelings? - No. Sort of. But not physically. - If you've acted on them metaphysically, son, then this isn't a simple case of lust and we're in deeper waters than I thought. Are you in love? - I don't know, father. - You can love God and love a girl at the same time, Hubert. You just can't be a priest while you're doing it. Do you still want to be a priest? - Yes. What should I do, father? - Search your heart. And keep your hands to yourself. Say three Hail Marys, two Our Fathers. Say your rosary and pray for strength. You're going to need it. (troubled music) - [Hub] What did he want? - Hubert, please, I have to hurry! - Wait, not until you tell me what's going on. - I can't, it's too dangerous! - What kind of trouble are you in? - Professor Coburn, he's hiding from the authorities. No one knows where he is. - So, What does that have to do with you? - There's nothing you can do. There's nothing anyone can do. - Wait, how do you know that until you tell me? - Go home, see your family. Forget about me! - Tell me the truth, I'm begging you, please! I can help you. - My father's name is not Ludwig Schiller. It's Abraham. - [Toppy] Honey, has he said he'd rewrite the script yet? - No, and I don't understand. It's something he's always loved doing. I thought I'd won him over completely. - Can you try again? - I could, but I hate pressuring him when he's so busy. - But I am getting desperate. - I'm sorry, Toppy, I think you're gonna have to go on the assumption that Max won't do it. Don't forget, Hub's train comes in at 4:25. (laughs) See you tomorrow! - Yeah. (humming) - Where is that file? (gentle music) - [Violet] Dad, can you help me rehearse my lines for the Christmas pageant? - Okay. Okay, Vi, you play the angel, and Zach, you play the shepherd boy, okay? And I'll do everybody else. Okay Vi, you start. - And then spoke the Lord to me, the angel of the Lord, and I did tell the coming of a child. - But this cannot be. My beloved, my wife Mary is a virgin. There can be no child with us, with us. - [Violet] The child will be a child of the Lord. - Oh, we are blessed by the Lord. We are with child, this is terrible, Violet. No wonder you can't learn these lines. Jim, what are you doing? Okay, Violet, try it like this. I am an angel of the Lord and he told me to bring Mary news of the child. - I am the angel of the Lord and he-- - And he told me to bring-- - And he told me to bring Mary news of the child. - Yeah. - That's a lot easier. - It's good. - You're so good at this. - You've been talking to Toppy haven't you? - Come on, Max, they really need your help. - I have enough on my plate as it is, Honey. - But you love it, you're a natural. I haven't seen you have this much fun in months. (playful music) - How many of you have memorized your lines? That is not acceptable. I want you to spend all weekend learning this script. - But you said the words were too hard. - I don't care how bad it is. You're gonna get it down pat by Monday! - They might have more success if they worked on a revised version. - Oh! - Now you guys only have 10 days to memorize this, but I'm sure you'll manage. - Honey said you were too busy! - Honey's too smart for her own good. - You've been working on this without telling her? - Well, I didn't think I'd complete it on time, I didn't wanna get anybody's hopes up. (squeals) There you go. - What do you think? - Very nice. What's the occasion? - Hub's coming home. So I have to look my absolute best at the train station. - Maisey. - Think I should wear makeup? He's never seen me in makeup so. - Maisey. (gentle music) - What, he's not a priest yet! Is that from Grace? Is it bad news? - They're back in England, but Mother Bailey's got pneumonia, so they couldn't leave when they were supposed to. - Well, they're gonna be home for Christmas, aren't they? - Of course they are, we can't have Christmas without Mother Bailey and Grace. - Okay. (lighthearted music) (women squealing) - [Hub] Hey! - You look thin, you're not eating! - I eat plenty, Mom. - Don't listen to her, you look very handsome! - Hi, Aunt Toppy. Maisey? You look nice. It's so good to see everyone. It's so good to be home. - Welcome to the wandering scholar. - My little brother. And my other little brother. How you doin', Fat? - Not bad I guess. - Let's get you home and get some dinner into you. - Mom, mom, this is my friend, Anna Schiller. She's from Vienna. She doesn't have any family here, so I invited her to spend Christmas with us. - Are you sure you don't mind letting me stay here? - Of course not, we have lots of room and there's only a couple of us here, not 'til Grace and Mother Bailey come home. And then, well. - You are very kind. - Nonsense, any friend of Hub's. - Just so you know, I get up very early. So, you might wanna stay in the room on the third floor. - It's freezing up there. We wouldn't want our guest to get frostbite, would we? No, Anna will stay in Hub and Fat's old room. - Thank you so much. Would you mind if I rested? It's been a busy day. - I'll show you the way. - Oh, no, that's all right. Just tell me which one and I can find it. - Upstairs. Third door on the left. - Thank you. - Do you think she's, you know. - I'm not sure. Schiller could be a Jewish name or German. Hub says she's from Austria. - I mean do you think she's his girlfriend? - How can she be? Hub's gonna be a priest. Unless he's changed his mind. (soft music) - Well, I think he feels sorry for her. That's why he brought her here. - [Hub] I forgot how much I missed your cooking, Mom. - Why didn't you let us know that you were bringing home a friend? - I decided at the last minute. She looked so sad this morning. - [Honey] Do you and Anna have classes together? - No, she's part of the music department. They say she's gonna be a famous cellist one day. - Then how did you meet her? - The anti-fascist group. - So, she's not one of the Austrians that welcomed Hitler with open arms? - [Hub] No. - How did you find time for politics in your busy schedule? - [Fat] Not to mention girlfriends. - Fat. - I didn't know they let priests have girlfriends now. - Well, I'm not a priest and she's not my girlfriend, Fat. - She's very pretty. Why don't they let priests have girlfriends? - It's a little complicated, Vi. - Did you meet her at a demonstration? - No, she helps organize them. We hand out flyers and put up posters. - I know you didn't really spend all your time studying. - Actually, Fat, this is just as important. - It's not your job to save the world, Hub. - Mom, if you can bury your head in the sand and hope Hitler will go away, that's fine. I can't. (burdened music) Excuse me. - Is Anna really just a friend? - Yes. - Because if you've chosen to abandon your calling-- - Oh, mom, please! - Are you gonna let the first girl who comes along change everything you've hoped and planned for? - If I choose to become a priest, it's gonna be because I've searched my soul. - Guess you're not perfect anymore. - Never was, Fat. You made that up to make yourself feel better about what a screw up you are, remember? What's biting you anyway? - You better watch it. You cross me and you're gonna have to answer to the RCMP. - What? - I'm gonna be a Mountie. - You know, Fat, just so you know, all that stuff about the noble Mounties is a fairy tale. They're underhanded and arbitrary, just like all cops. - What do you know about it? - More than you think. - How, you broke the law lately? - That's right, Fat, it's me, Hub, the criminal. (soft music) - [Max] Where are you going at this hour? - Morning mass. - So, you haven't abandoned the church. - Is that what my mother said? - You be patient with your mother, Hub. She wants you to be a priest. And if you want it, I'm all for it. I gotta tell you, Hub, I couldn't do it, and most men can't. - Max, why does everyone think Anna's my girlfriend? - Because you seem to care about her. - I care about a lot of people. - All I'm saying, Hub, Hub, if it's more than that. - Why does it have to matter so much? - Women or the church? - I don't even know, both. - University, you're growin' up, Hub. You still ask the tough questions. - I gotta go, I don't wanna be late for mass. - Okay. - You think she'll want eggs? - Who cares? She can eat what we're eating. - You never eat anything for breakfast. I don't know how you get through the day. - That's what my mother always says. Everyone is up so early. - I work. - On Sunday? - Maisey does the early shift at the phone company. And what have you got planned for today, Anna? - Well, I have to practice my cello and then Hubert told me he'd show me around New Bedford. - Ah! - He's gonna be really busy with his family, you know. - How would you like to play in our Christmas pageant? Maisey's playin' the piano, but she could use some help. - I don't need any help. - Maisey! - I don't think that would be a very good idea. - Well, you've played at Christmas concerts haven't you? - Yes but-- - Well, then I won't take no for an answer. - You'll have to fit in with the piano. - I'm sure Anna can manage. Aren't you late for work? (pleasant music) - [Hub] Can't a guy get any service around here? - We're closed, it's Sunday, come back tomorrow. - [Hub] No good, I need my car fixed now! - Hub! (laughs) - It looks to me like you are working Sunday. I think you had it better when you were working in the mine. - Hey, look at you, a university student. Thanks for droppin' by, Hub. - Thanks, Bill. Thing is I need a really big favor. - Name it. - I was hoping I could use some of the equipment in the garage to make a Christmas present. - Oh, it's for the new girlfriend I heard about? - How did you hear about that? - Ah, just around. - Yeah, well you can tell that big mouth brother of mine that she's not my girlfriend and this present is for my mother. - Sorry, Hub, I didn't mean to offend. - It's alright. - I won't mention it again. Come on, some of this machinery's kinda tricky. - And I met Maisey just over there. Fat was chasing me one day and I crashed right into her. - Were you hurt? - Just my pride. And Max and Mom got married right up on that gazebo. (indistinct) - And this is where we go to get away from the crowds. - Oh, it must be very romantic with the moon and stars. (Hub chuckles) (gentle music) - Nothing about this place seems very romantic to me right now. - It's a warm cozy home, I see why you miss it. - Well, it's not the apartment I miss, it's the people. At least I used to. - Used to? - Yeah, we had an argument last night. A pretty bad one. - About what? - It was silly. Here, there's something else I wanna show you. These were my favorites. They're about children who find these magic carpets and ride them into strange new worlds. Here, for you. - I can't take them. - You can read them while you're here. - Oh, I wish I could show you our attic in Vienna and all the books that belonged to my great grandfather. Such beautiful pictures. - Well, one day I'll go to Vienna and you can show me everything. (regretful music) - I can't. The Nazis took our house, and the treasures, the photographs, memories. They're all gone. - I'm sorry, Anna, I didn't realize. - My brother and I went back once to look in the garbage to see if we could find anything. The Nazis took everything, even my cello. The one I play now is from Professor Coburn. - He helped you get into Canada, didn't he? - I didn't want to leave. My father, he said it was a terrible risk. I told him, "No, don't make me go." But they wanted me to be safe. - You are safe here. - [Violet] Hub, are you home? We're back! - Anna, I didn't realize... - I'm just loaning her some books. - I have to go. I promised Toppy I'd play at the Christmas pageant rehearsal. It was nice to see you, Mrs. Sutton. - I'll see you out. - I'm the angel of the Lord and he told me to bring Mary news of a child. - But I am the blessed Virgin, I cannot have a child. - Zach, it's your line. - Who are you talking to? - [Max] Mary. - Mary. - It's great, Zach. This time just a little louder. - Who are you talking to, sweet Mary? (applauds) - [Toppy] Let's take a break. There's hot chocolate and muffins. Be back in fifteen, everyone. - [Zach] Yeah! - Not you, Maisey. This is your chance to practice with Anna. - I'm going for a drink of water. - If Maisey wants to play on her own... - Are you all right? - Oh. Yes, it's just this time of year, I miss my family. - I know what that's like. My daughter, Doris, we're out of touch. I miss her all the time. But it's worst at Christmas. And that's why you need to play. It'll cheer you up. Do you know "Angels We Have Heard On High?" - [Maisey] That's the English version. - Anna, why don't you begin and then Maisey can come in after the first line? - Um no, I think that the piano should start. And I can come in on the glorias? ("Angels We Have Heard On High") (applauds) - Great. - Maisey, you play so well. And without lessons, it's incredible. - In fact, if the play's a bomb, music like that'll save us. - Shall we try the others? - Yeah. - Oh, Jim. - Max. - I've been meaning to ask you something. I'll hop right to it. Would you be willing to take the position of principal for a semester? - In your place? - Yes. - Why? - It's me, I need a break! - Oh, well, of course. - But can we keep it between ourselves for now? - Sure, but the school board's gonna have to know. - We'll make an announcement after the holidays. - After the holidays. - Oh, Jim, about the Christmas pageant. - Yeah, I know, you've taken over. I just can't believe how much people hated that script. - They didn't hate it. - Oh, yes, they did. But I'll just be glad that Toppy won't be harassing me anymore. (playful music) (Toppy laughing) (girls humming) - Are you sure you don't wanna play some more? I could go on all night! - It's wonderful to make music with friends, yes? - It's better than anything. - You don't wanna tire yourselves out before the pageant. - Mrs. Bailey, you are standing on a letter. - Oh, that's strange, there's no mail on Sundays. It's a telegram. - What is it? (tender music) - It's from Grace. - Mother's recovery longer than expected, stop. Departure in January, stop. Miss everyone terribly, stop. Merry Christmas. (sighs) - Thanks, but I won't be needing your assistance. A small town like this, the less the locals know the better. - Excuse me, are you with the RCMP? - Yes, I am. - Are you here for me? - Why would you think that? - Well, I sent my application a few weeks ago. I thought they'd write before they send someone to do the interview, but if you're ready, I'm ready. - Ah, you applied to join the RCMP? - I did. - Well, unfortunately, son, I'm here on official business, not intake. - Oh. Well, maybe when you've done your business, if you had any time, even fifteen minutes, anything you could do to help me. - I'll tell you what, see what I can do. - You're doing a great job for a beginner. - Thanks, I just hope I can get it done in time for Christmas. - Well, you know, it's lookin' good so far. - Thanks. - So, life in the big city's pretty exciting I bet. - Actually, I spend most of my time in church or studying. - Come on, no all-night beer bashes? When your dad was your age, he used to carry on! - I heard those stories. (troubled music) - What, what is it? - It's nothing. - I wonder what that Mountie's doin' in town? - I gotta go, Bill, I'll see you. Hurry, he could be here any minute. - Maybe we should call for help. Professor Coburn said- - No, there's no time. Anyway, I've got a plan. - Hey, Anna, you feel like playing something before reher... What's going on? - They were all out of white, so I got brown. And don't get mad, but I ran into a Mountie downstairs and I asked him to give me a few tips. - Finishing high school is the only tip that matters. - Hub didn't do so well in high school either. - Why do you always compare yourself to your brother? - Because everyone expects me to be like him, but I'm not. (knocking on door) - Oh, good afternoon, ma'am. Is this the Bailey residence? - How did you find where I live? Mom, this is the Mountie I was telling you about. - Come in. - Thank you. Inspector Wells, RCMP. - You want to speak with my son, Henry? - No, that's not the reason I'm here, Mrs. Bailey. - Mrs. Sutton. I used to be a Bailey. - Oh. - Who exactly are you looking for? - Hubert Bailey. Does he live here? - There's no sign of any Mounties. - All right, we're almost there, but the last part is the hardest. You two stay here until I give the signal, all right? - Okay. - You cold? You're shaking, you know. - This is what it was like in Vienna. Always hiding, always running, everyone in danger. My brother, my parents. Now you and Hubert. - Hey, this is New Bedford, there aren't any Nazis here. - All right, let's go. - Come on. - Technically Anna Schiller is a fugitive ma'am, wanted by the RCMP. - That's not possible! - I have a deportation order with her name on it. - Deportation? But why? - She falsified her papers, deceived immigration officials with the help of an immigrant smuggling ring. - But what did she lie about? - She's Jewish, ma'am. She's a refugee without proper papers. - Why does that matter? - Our current laws don't allow Jews to immigrate to Canada. Is she in this house? - She's staying here, but Hub came over a while ago and they all went out, Hub, Anna and Maisey. - Where did they go? - He didn't say. Hub's showing her New Bedford. - If he's knowingly harboring an illegal person, he could be in as much trouble as she is. - Are you gonna arrest my brother? - That depends on how much cooperation I get from the rest of you. - I'd like a one-way ticket for the next train to Toronto please. (train whistling off) On that one that's coming right now. Thank you. - Thank you. Well, looks like somebody warned her and she took off again. - Are you suggesting that Hub-- - He couldn't possibly know. He would never break the law. - I am just looking at the evidence, ma'am. She's packed her things and gone. Either she skipped town or someone is helping her hide. - I think I know where Hub hid her. - Inspector, why have you come all the way to New Bedford? - I told you. - I'm sorry, but you're treating her like a criminal! She's a lovely young woman! - Who got into Canada with the help of powerful people, part of an international underground organization that is determined to undermine the laws of this country, ma'am. - There's no one like that in New Bedford, I can assure you, Inspector. - There's a secret place we used to go to when we were kids. They could be there. - How long will it take us to get there? - About a half hour, it's in the bush. - All right. Ladies. - Why didn't you stop him? - How? Tell him to cover for his brother right in front of the inspector? (soft music) - [Max] Come on, you guys. (laughing) - Oh, it's just you. - That's a nice hello. - I was hoping you were Hub or Fat. - Watch your hands, you guys. Why? You look upset, what happened? What? - You didn't find them? - No sign of anybody out there. - Find whom? - Max, it's complicated. This is Inspector-- - Wells, RCMP, Toronto Detachment. We've met. - You have, how? - Mr. Bailey, perhaps we should speak downstairs. - Can I come with you? - Are you looking for Anna Schiller? 'Cause I can tell you exactly where she is. - Anna? - Go on. - She took the noon train to Toronto. Here's her ticket stub. She should be arriving at Union Station in a couple of hours. - Are you aware that this girl is a fugitive? - No, I had no idea. - Then why did she leave? - She didn't like it here. The locals weren't very friendly. I put her on the train myself. - Hmm. Well I'll inform the Toronto Detachment and they'll meet her at her train. - You're not leaving tonight, not before we get a chance to talk? - Well, you know, there is a storm brewing in the south and I'd rather not drive through it if I don't have to. I'll leave tomorrow. Perhaps by then some new information might come to light. (veiled music) - Hub knew they wanted to deport her and you helped him hide her somewhere in New Bedford. - No, she went back to Toronto. - You're lying, I can see it all over your face! - I am not. - Maisey, you shouldn't have sent her to Toronto. They'll pick her up the minute that she gets off the train. There are lots of places in town to hide her until that Mountie gives up and goes home. - You're trying to smoke me out. - I am. But not to turn her in, I wanna help. Where is she? - I told you. Toronto. (sighs) - You realize you've broken the law. You could go to jail! - The Mountie just said that to scare you. - Well, it worked! - I don't care if they punish me for trying to help her. They've taken everything away from her family, their home, their work. They put them in a ghetto where their father can't even get medication when he's ill. And they're the lucky ones 'cause they're not in the camps. - I'm sorry for what's happening to them. But I don't see why you should risk so much. - And I can't explain it to you, I'm sorry. - Hub? - Where did he go? - I don't know. - Where are you going? - Out. - No you don't. - Be back in time for dinner. Why are you supporting Hub? - And why aren't you? Hub hasn't changed. He's the same kind-hearted, principled boy you raised. - He's infatuated with her! - So what if it is an infatuation? What if it's love? - All the more reason to send her away. - Tell me you don't mean that. - Hey. - [Anna] Why were you running? - [Hub] My brother was chasing me. Don't worry though, I lost him. - But Wells is not upstairs. - Which is exactly why he won't look here. And Fat's definitely not smart enough to figure it out. - Hub and Fat. You have funny names here. - Yeah, well, they're nicknames from when we were kids. Fat's real name is Henry. - Can I call you Hub instead of Hubert? - Oh, I don't know. I kinda like the way you call me, (imitates Anna's accent) Hubert. - Hub, that means the center of everything, right? - Yeah, like the hub of a wheel. - That's right for you. You make yourself the center. - I don't mean to. - Oh, not like people who grab you and force you. There's something in you that's so good, so true. Makes everyone turn to you. - I would've said the same thing about you. Anna, I-- - Psst. Some scones from Toppy. And guess what, she's on our side. Don't worry, I didn't say anything. But when she started talking about how stupid she thought that Mountie was, I figured it'd be okay to let her make you some food. Her scones are the best. This is great, you made this into a living room. It feels like home. - Maisey? - You're right down here close to the boiler. You're not gonna need a lot of blank, you can even play your cello if you wanted to. - Maisey! You're talking too loud. - Sorry. - It's probably alright, but why risk it, right? - You're right. - You don't have to whisper, just don't shout. - I wasn't shouting. I mean, I wasn't shouting. - Thank you for the food, Maisey. It was very kind of you. - Ah, it's nothing. I gotta go to rehearsal, so see you guys later. - Go after her, Hub, make her feel better. - Why, Maisey won't rat on us. - I know that. But didn't you see how hurt she was? She's in love with you. - Maisey? No, we've known each other since we were kids. Maisey doesn't think about me that way. - You don't think about her that way so you don't see it. Now hurry, catch her! - Maisey, wait. (gentle music) - I have to go to rehearsal, Hub. - I just wanted to tell you how proud I am of you. - Of me? - Yeah, for what you're doing for Anna. - She doesn't deserve all this grief. - You're a good friend. - Yeah, well, thanks, I guess. - [Hub] Wait. - I have to go. - Well, that went well, don't you think? - Mhm. - [Toppy] I'm so glad that Max stepped in. - Well, I'm gonna go to bed. - What's wrong, Maisey? You haven't said a word all evening. - Nothing's wrong. There, that's two words. - If you're worried that I'm gonna gonna give Anna away-- - Don't talk to me about her. - You're not making any sense. You just risked jail to save her and now you're angry at her. - Well, he's in love with her. I saw them. They were kissing. - Oh, dear. - He's never gonna look at me like that. - Maisey, I know you can't imagine this right now, but some day you're gonna meet another boy and he's gonna fall so far in love with you, that you won't even remember what you felt for Hub Bailey. (Maisey cries) - Morning, Henry. - Morning, Inspector. - You wanted some advice about the RCMP did you? - I do. - Well, tell me first, why do you wanna be a Mountie? - Do something good for my country. - Now, that's good. But you know, it's not easy. They won't take you unless you're single and can't get married for seven years. And even then they have to approve your bride before you marry her. (laughs) It's almost like being a priest, really. - My brother's gonna be a priest. - Oh, yes, I know. Now, as far as the job is concerned, well the best piece of advice I could give you, trust your instincts. You got a feelin' somethin's wrong, chances are, you're right. - That's why you stayed in town, isn't it? Your instinct told you Anna's still here. - They didn't find her at Union Station. Of course, could've gotten off that train anywhere between here and Toronto. You think your brother's lyin'? - I don't know. - Aw, come on now, most brothers know each other better than that, don't they? (laughs) - I really don't know if he's lying. (afflicted music) - If you think you can string me along to protect your brother. - I'm not, I tried to follow him last night but I lost him. - Just like you took me on that wild goose chase yesterday. - No. I really thought Hub would be there. If Anna's in town, I don't know where she is. - Look, this is not one of your little family dramas, kid. This goes all the way to Ottawa, you understand that? - Inspector Wells, you have a telegram. - All right now, is this a tip or did one of our men see Coburn with his own eyes? No, don't move in on him yet. I want that town crawlin' with cops by the time I get there. You got five hours. And don't lose him this time. All right. - Where are you off to? - School. - No holidays for the principal? - Not this week. Too much paper work. Hub, you be careful, you watch yourself. Wells hasn't left yet. I saw him in the lobby a half an hour ago. - Thanks, Max, but I got nothin' to hide. - I gotta go. - You missed breakfast. - Yeah, I needed the sleep. All those nights staying up cramming. - Hub, when I see you losing touch with yourself-- - I'm not. - Hear me out. You're young, so you don't know how easy it is for a stranger to come into your life and put you off course. - Mom, don't you see that I'm doing everything you taught me? I'm standing up for the weak. I'm protecting the innocent. (soft music) - You've hidden her, haven't you? - No, she left yesterday, like I said. - You're lying. - Look, please don't tell Wells. - Look at yourself. You can't tell me she hasn't change you! (daunting music) - Where's Hub and Maisey? - Your brother just went out. - I know, but he came back in with Maisey. Are they on the fire escape? - I told you he went out. He's not here. - Aren't you hungry? - Not so much. - You don't need to be scared, really. - Maisey, you don't know what she's been through. - Yes, I do. I read the newspapers, I know what goes on in Germany. Do you think your family will get out? - Maisey. - We tried. (light music) But they could only help one of us. My parents said it had to be me. I felt so guilty leaving them. - You shouldn't. - Yes, I should. - Don't say that. None of this is your fault. - I should because even if I could go back to be with them, I don't want to go back to the ghetto and the Nazis. I don't want to go back. (soft music) - Maisey! - It's your brother! - Oh, my God! I killed him. - Hi. - What happened to all your paper work? - I came home to apologize. I feel like I've been really hard on you. - Hub as much as told me he's hidden Anna somewhere in town. - I thought so. - I'm afraid for him, Max. - Honey, he's not gonna go to jail for this. - I'm afraid he's going to lose his faith. What if he's so taken with her, he can't even see it? - You think she has the power of a seductress? - I don't know. - Honey, why is it so important to you that Hub become a priest? You were as surprised as I was when he announced it. - I know. Because he was so young. But then I thought, after everything I've been through, finally the angels are smiling on my family again. - You want Hub to live his life so you can get your foot in heaven's door? - You weren't brought up Catholic, Max. You don't understand. - [Anna] Don't' move so quickly. (grunts) - [Anna] Put your head between your knees. Like that. Better? - [Fat] Mhmm. - He needs something sweet. - Scones? - Jam, Hub, give him a few spoonfuls. - No, I don't like jam. - Everybody likes jam, Fat. - Wait! Before he comes to, do you think we should tie him up? - Hey, what do you mean? - He's gonna turn you in, aren't you, Fat? - He thinks he's doing the right thing. - Wait, hold on! Ahh! I'm not turning anyone in because Wells is gone. - Why should we believe you? You're working for him. - Why do you always assume the worst of me? - I saw the look he gave you when he said he was staying. (sighs) - I don't even know why I tried to do this. Ahh! - You know, Fat, you should become a cop. You're dirty enough for the job. (laughs) - Stop it, he's been hurt. - No. - He might have a concussion. If you hurt your brother to protect me, then it's like the Nazis have reached across the ocean and poisoned your family too. Just let him turn me in. - No! - Why doesn't anybody listen to me? I heard Wells on the phone. Something about finding a guy named Coburn. He checked out of the hotel and left. - So, this isn't a trick? - Can't be, he has no way of knowing about Professor Coburn. - Finally, somebody hears me. I guess I'm not surprised it isn't my brother. (laden music) - Of course you had to come back here. We'll find some way to help you. - But everyone in town must know. - Nonsense, Wells is gone and nobody needs to know what he was doing here. - What if he comes back? - Well, He might not come back if he finds Coburn. - That's right. He said he was really here because he was after Coburn, not you. - Do you think I'm really safe? - Yes. - Yes! - Here. You all right, hold on to me. She needs to rest. I don't think she slept at all last night. - Well, I think we could all use a rest. But maybe something stronger first. Sherry anyone? (tender music) ("Tidings of Comfort and Joy") - [Violet] Trimming the tree is my favorite part of Christmas. - Fat, you wanna help me get this tree up? - I would, but you don't believe anything I say. - I was just asking you a question, Fat. - Now you're saying I'm not a man of my word. - Oh, good, now you're imagining things. - So, I'm dumb, untrustworthy and I'm crazy. - You can't fight on Christmas Eve! - They're not fighting. They're just being brothers. - Say you're sorry, both of you. - Go fly a kite. - Don't talk to Violet that way. - Maisey, Violet says there are some decorations we couldn't find. - No that was before we-- - Come, Zach, Violet, Maisey, upstairs. - Right, I'll help you. - You wanna know what bothers me? Why would you tell us that Wells had gone when you were still following me? - 'Cause Wells said if we cooperated with you, you wouldn't go to jail. That's why. - You weren't just trying to make points with him? - I don't know, partly. You're my brother and I hate your guts sometimes, but I'd never turn you in. (simple music) - Look, I'm sorry I got so angry. I should've trusted you. You really like all this cop stuff eh? Following people around, getting the bad guy? - I'm not so sure if I like Wells. But for the first time, something really clicked. - I know that feeling. - I don't wanna compete with you anymore, Hub. - I don't wanna compete with you either, Fat. - Truce? - Let's get this tree up. - Yeah. - All finished decorating? - Almost. - The house looks beautiful. You've done a wonderful job. - Thanks. We better get going. Everyone's already on the way to the pageant. - I know. I thought we could talk. Hub, I'm sorry. I think it's hard for me letting you grow up. I still wanna protect you. - You can't. - I know that. But when I met Anna, I heard how involved you were with all this political work, all I could think of was I'm gonna lose you. And I was afraid. I never wanted to hurt you or Anna. - I never wanted to hurt you either, mom. - I know. Are you very much in love with her? (sobs) - And then you say? - The boy son Jesus is born. - It's the son of God is born, now try it again. - Right, son God is born. - Okay, and then you say? - Right, all the world rejoice. - No, that's Bobby's line, okay? Okay, you guys ready? Oh, yeah, I gotta go, baby. - Are you nervous? - I didn't think I was gonna be, but I am. - It's exciting isn't it? - [Max] Yes, it is. - Face it, Max, you're a born writer. - No, I'm a teacher. - Well, you can be both, you know. - I'm too busy to write plays. - You weren't too busy to write this one. - Maybe when Honey gets her degree and the kids are grown, but right now there aren't enough hours in a day. Curtain! (audience applauds) (pleasant music) - I'm the angel of the Lord, come on a wonderful mission. But, first, I have to find Mary and Joseph. I asked for them in the bazaar and no one knows how to find them. Can you help me? I'm looking for Shepherd Joseph. - What would a rich person like you want with a lowly shepherd? - I'm not rich, I'm an angel. ♪ Gloria ♪ ♪ In excelsis deo ♪ ♪ Gloria ♪ ♪ In excelsis deo ♪ (audience applauds) (bell tolling) - [Violet] Wake up, wake up, (indistinct) Christmas! - The presents are here, wake up! - Wake up! - Wow, Zach, look at all these presents! - [Zach] Look at all the presents! - [Violet] Wow! - [Fat] This one's for you. - Who's this one from? Violet. What is it? (Violet giggles) Oh, it's a-- - Pencil box. I was gonna give you mine, but I thought I'd make you one instead so you could remember me every time you write something. - Thank you, Violet, it's the best pencil box I've ever received. - Look what I got. - Yeah. - There, Fat, this one's for you. - Binoculars? - So you can be a better spy. (laughing) - He's gonna be a Mountie, not a spy. - Thanks, Hub. - They're real binoculars? - Yeah. This one's for you, Violet. - Oh, it's so pretty! Put it in my hair right now. - It's really nice, Fat. - Who's this one for? - I don't know, it doesn't have a name. - That's not for anyone here, it's for later. - Merry Christmas, Mrs. Sutton. - You look well-rested, which is strange since we hardly had any sleep. - I was energized by the play. - You're gonna need a nice long nap this morning or you're not gonna make it through the day. - On the contrary, Mrs. Sutton, I'm going to dance through Christmas with my beautiful wife. (indistinct) (both laughing) - Enough pies to feed an army. - [Toppy] That's okay, it's the one time you can go overboard. - I knew it was Hub. - She knows you better than I do. - Well, I ought to. Known him since I was 10. I bet he's brought us presents, right? - Maisey? - Oh, it's okay. I did. (Hub and Toppy laugh) - I found it at the pawn shop. It's not scratched at all. I don't know if you can play it in your residence. - A guy down the hall has a Victrola. Whenever I listen to it, I'll think of you. Here, for you. - Saint Christopher? - Patron saint of travelers. Because you're gonna have great adventures in your life and you're gonna visit many wonderful places and see many exciting things. You've got such a big heart, Maisey, you always jump in with both feet, you don't hold anything back. I hope that we're gonna be friends for a long, long time. - Thank you. Oh, go ahead, Anna, you're next. See if he can make you cry too. - It's a little rough but... (gentle music) - It's a hanukkiah! You made this for me? It's beautiful. Thank you. For you. - Poetry? - I marked one for you. - "To see a world in a grain of sand, heaven in a wildflower, hold infinity in the palm of your hand, and eternity in an hour." How did you know I love Blake? - It wasn't difficult to guess. - Violet, Zach, we're leaving in five minutes. - We can't go yet. - Why not? - You haven't opened my present. - I nearly forgot. (both laugh) Where is it? - Where's mine? - You first. - Come on. - Hmm. (laughs) A ticket to Toronto for January with an open return? - I arranged it with the university. You're gonna take real classes in Toronto next semester. Jim's agreed to be acting principal so I can look after things here. - How did you know this was what I wanted? You are the most wonderful man, the best husband in the whole world. Oh, what did I do to deserve you? - You were you. The best wife, the best friend a man could ever have. - I better get your present. - [Max] Oh, Honey. - So you can finish "The Miner's Son." - How do you know about my play? - I found it. I want you to write, Max. It gives you so much joy. So, I called the university too and told them I'd stop taking courses for this semester to give you time to work on your play. - Come here. Thank you, Honey. - [Violet] Look at all the presents! Let's go see! - I won't let you drop your B.A. - I'm not, I'm just postponing it until you finish your play. - How about a compromise? You stay, take one course, I let Jim stand as principal, and I'll have time to write. - You promise you'll work on your play no matter how busy you get at school? - I promise. - Okay, it's a deal. (laughs) (bells ringing) - [Toppy] Dinner is ready. - Hurray, I want dark meat! - Wait. I've got an announcement to make. I spent a lot of time this holiday thinking about what I wanna do with my life. I've made some decisions. Mom, I'm sorry, I know that you think this is because of Anna, and maybe it was at first, but it definitely isn't anymore. I wanna have an effect on the world. I thought I could do that being a priest, but now I know that I can do that other ways. - Here, here. Whatever you do, Hub, you're cut out for great things. - Now can we eat? - Yes, now we can eat. - Wait, hold on, I have an announcement too. I know you all think I haven't been serious about being a Mountie because lately I have been changing my mind a lot. But last week I had a taste of what it was like to be in the RCMP, and I'm really sure that's what I wanna do, after I finish high school. So, I'm gonna get the best marks I can and next year I'm gonna join the force, if they'll have me. - That sounds like a very well-thought-out plan, Fat. - All right, can we eat now? (Max laughs) - No, we can't. Anna, you promised. - But everyone's hungry. - You said it would take less than a minute. (speaking in foreign language) - Happy Hanukkah. - [Everyone] Happy Hanukkah. (graceful music) - You wish you were with them, don't you? - We always sang at Hanukkah. My father has the most beautiful voice. He was going to be the cantor at the synagogue. - That's like the choir? - The leader of the choir. - It must be so difficult not knowing how your family is. - Yes. - Anna, if I were your parents, I'd have done just what they did. You try to keep your children safe. That's more important than anything. - Are you sad that Hubert's not going to become a priest? - I was. But now he's grown up and found his true self. So I'm happy. - Whatever he does, he'll be a good man. I think because you are a good mother. - He's my first son and I'll always love him no matter what. - He knows it, Mrs. Sutton. He loves you too. - Why don't you come downstairs? I think Hub is missing you. - Fat, wait. - Look, you don't have to say anything. I already know how you feel. - No, you don't. - With Hub, you say he's destined for great things. But with me-- - I didn't say anything because you took me by surprise. - Look, I already decided I'm not gonna compete with Hub anymore. I don't care if you don't think I'm as good as him. - Stop making assumptions, sit down and let me speak. What I wanted to say was I'm sorry I dismissed you the way I did when you announced you wanted to be a Mountie. But you've grown up and I'm proud of you, Henry. I'm very proud. - You mean that? - Yes. - I talked with your mother. - Wells is back, we gotta go. Here, hurry! You really should call now. - Professor Coburn told me it was dangerous. - He also told you to use it if you need help. If Wells is back this soon he's not gonna give up. You need to call. - Hello, may I have Russell 3940 please? Hello, my name is Anna Schiller. You know the way without a map? - It's only one road to (indistinct). It's pretty hard to get lost. Anna, what if I come with you? - You can't, not for me. - If they can take you across the border into the U.S., they can take me too. Unless you don't want me. - Of course I want you. As much as I want anything. How far is it? - We have to drive all night. This must be the place. - How long 'til they get here? - Well, they said to be here at five and it's 4:45, so... - You're very prompt. - Professor Coburn, I thought the Mounties caught you! - So did they, but they were wrong. Anna, I have some wonderful news. Your family is out of Austria and they're in Holland now. - They're all right? They're well, they're not hurt? - Well, we don't know what's going to happen next but this is the first step. Mr. Bailey, I wanna thank you for all the help you've given Anna. Now we must hurry, the boat is this way. - No, wait, we have a request. - I wanna go with Anna. - No, no, no, no. That's out of the question. - Please! - Anna, we're going to change your identity. You can't tell anyone, not even Mr. Bailey, where you are or what your name is. If you even write to him, you risk exposing the whole organization. - There's no other way? - No. Now please, we have to cross into the United States before daybreak. (aching music) - I love you. I will always love you. - Well, this isn't goodbye, not forever. - We don't know that. - I'm gonna find you. I'm gonna come get you and bring you back. - But if you can't... - Don't ever give up on me. - You're like a star, Hubert, shining in the sky for me, my light in the darkness. - I love you. ♪ Silent night ♪ ♪ Holy night ♪ ♪ All is calm ♪ ♪ All is bright ♪ ♪ Round yon Virgin, mother and child ♪ (delightful music) (bird tweeting) (regal music)
