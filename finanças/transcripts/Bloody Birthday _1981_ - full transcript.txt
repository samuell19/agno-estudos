- How's she doing? - Fine, but we have two more in labor. You sure can forget about watching that eclipse. We'd better get on in. Mrs. Brody, I thought I told you to wait till next week. Tell it to the baby. - How's Mrs. Seton? - A few minutes. First time I've ever had the ladies gang up on me. I've waited some time. - Shallow breaths now. - Push! It's a boy, Mrs. Taylor. Oh, he's beautiful. Open, Mrs. Brody. Bear down! Push. It's a girl, Mrs. Brody. It doesn't even have a name yet! It's a boy, Mrs. Seton. Do you want to play ambulance? What's that? Well this is the ambulance, and when you want it to stop, you say, "red light". Red light! I don't remember an ambulance stopping for a red light. - What if somebody sees us out here? - Nobody will see us here. Well, they might, cos we're right out here in the open. If you're that worried about somebody seeing us... Come on. On! Willard, if that's you, I'm gonna kick your ass! ♪ Woman ♪ soft and gentle as a breeze... ♪ Hi. - What are you doing? - I was feeding the dog. Well, then, why didn't you come through the door like a normal person? I... I got locked out. Alright, birdman, get to bed. You're lucky mom and dad aren't home. Does anybody know why it's important to cooperate with the police? Curtis? The job of the police is to protect people and help them if they're in trouble. You're late, Joyce. The police need everyone's cooperation. If you want the credit for civics for helping out here, you're going to have to be on time. That's right. Kiss-ass. Does anybody know what the word "murder" means? Debbie? It's when someone kills someone, like on TV. No, honey, not like on TV. TV is just pretend. What does he think we are, a bunch of babies? Has anyone lost or found a skipping rope with a handle like this? I'm sure some of you have heard that Annie Smith and Duke Benson have been murdered. Were any of you in the cemetery last night? If you remember seeing anything unusual, you can tell miss Davis or come and tell me. That bell does not mean that you are dismissed. It is only a signal for me to dismiss you. Thank you, sheriff Brody. Thank you, miss Davis. - Bye, dad. - Bye, honey. When you are all sitting quiet and straight at your desks, I will let go. You're not sitting straight enough. Alright. Now, I don't want to see any of you running out of here like a bunch of hooligans. Dis-missed! - Where were you last night? - Feeding the dog. - Are you lying to me? - No. - Are you sure? - Yes, positive. If mom and dad call, don't tell them about Duke and Annie. Why not? Because I don't want dad worrying. It's bad for his heart. Miss Davis, can the class be excused from homework next Monday? - No, dear. - But it's our birthday. Everyone's gonna be at the party. Homework is more important than a party. And just because you all have the same birthday doesn't mean that you're special. Ok, have a nice day, miss Davis. Thank you, dear.

It's really creepy about Duke and Annie, no? - Yeah, it's really weird. - Horrible. Creepy. And Willard and I go to the graveyard all the time, you know? Why? Well, not to get buried, that's for sure. - Have you done his horoscope yet? - Yep. Well? Well, Willard should be flipped out over a hot little Scorpio like you. Oh, great! Hey, have you got any calls from Paul lately? No, he's busy with exams. Oh, are you sure that's all he's busy with? - Paul and I trust each other. - Yeah. Well, he wouldn't be too happy if he knew you're spending all that time working on a paper with Mr. Harding now. Beverly, Mr. Harding is married. Yeah, but he sure is cute. Lest he ever got the hots for you! Honestly, Beverly, you got a mind like an x-rated soap opera. Yeah, but you think he's cute, though, don't you? Come on, you do. I know you do. - Hi, daddy. - Hi. Hi, Joyce. - Beverly, where are you going? - To get some candles for the birthday cake, and then Willard and I are gonna go to the drive-in. - No, you're not. - Why? Don't ask why. Just be home before dark. One murder in twenty years, and he thinks he's Kojak! - Hi, honey. - Hi You know, the money we spend on security is no good if you keep the front door open. There's a psycho out there running around loose. I'm sorry. It's just been run, run, run, getting ready for this birthday party. - Yeah. - Everybody in town is coming. Daddy, daddy, come here. I want to show you something. What is it, angel? Hmm? What's wrong? Where did you get this? Debbie? What's wrong, Debbie? Hey, what happened? Mom, daddy fell! Mom, daddy fell! Steve, get out of the way! J-Jim? J-Jim? On! Sheriff Brody was a dedicated, honest, hardworking man. And now let me remind you of the words of our lord Jesus. "Let not your heart be troubled, "for in my father's house are many mansions. "I go now to prepare a place for you, in the house of the lord. "Where I go, you cannot follow, "but ye that believeth in me shall have eternal life" let us pray. Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Forgive us our trespasses, as those who trespass against us. And deliver us from evil, for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen. One, two, three, four, five, six... Come on. I got a real good place to hide. Don't copy our hiding place, or I'll shoot you. Uh, don't worry. It's only a phony. - Come on, let's get in. - No way, man, that's dangerous. Oh, I knew you were a chicken. We're not gonna shut both doors. Chicken, chicken! Chicken, chicken. You'd better get in the tub, or you're gonna be the first one caught. Curtis, please let me out! Curtis! This isn't funny! I'm not gonna play no more, Curtis. You let me out! Did you know the United States has a horoscope, just like people? Every twenty years, there's a conjunction of planets that's really bad, and every president that's been elected during that conjunction has died in office. I would definitely include that in your article. It's strange. It makes you wonder if our lives are planned out even before we're born. That's an interesting idea. Um... what do you say, we'll get a coke and talk about it some more? I'd really like to, but my little brother is home alone and I have to check in on him. How did you do that? I reconnected these and hooked this panel into the circuit. You little son of a gun. Where did you learn to do that? Let me out! Curtis! You let me out! Oh, man! Curtis! Joyce! Curtis! - How are you feeling, daddy? - Oh, I'm getting along ok. - You got everything under control? - Sure. Joyce, can you put Timmy on the line? Um, no, he's outside playing right now. Giving you any trouble? No more than usual. Help! Please, somebody help! Anybody! Help! Please! Can somebody help me? Dad and I are going to go on a wilderness trail. Do it, daddy, it'd be good for you. Are you sure you can manage by yourself for that long? Just relax! That's what you're on vacation for. Timmy! Timmy! Where have you been? In the junkyard. Curtis locked me in a refrigerator. Timmy, it's getting to the point when you don't even know when you're lying. I'm not lying! How did you scratch your hand? I told you, I was in the refrigerator. Sure, just like when you were feeding the dog. Come on, let's get it cleaned up before it gets infected. What were you really doing Sunday night? Alright, I was over at Debbie's house. - At night? - Yeah, but she wasn't home. Then why'd you go over there? Timmy, I know you're lying, so just tell me the truth. Ok. See, Debbie's got this little peephole in her closet. Well... so she charges 25 cents to watch Beverly... You know... Undress. You little peeping Tom! I didn't see anything, I promise. Debbie wasn't even home. You won't tell mom and dad, will you? No, don't worry. I don't want you playing with Curtis anymore. And I don't want you to go into the junkyard, ok? - Ok. - Promise? Yeah. Ok. "You're not quiet enough, children, you're not quiet enough. "That bell does only signal me to dismiss you. "It doesn't mean you're dismissed!" We'll sure make her quiet enough. Curtis, you should not sneak up on people. I wasn't sneaking, miss Davis. If you bring that replica to school one more time, I'm going to take it away from you, and you're not going to get it back. Alright, miss Davis. I'll put it away. Why don't you make yourself useful? Uh, get me some brushes. Uh! Hi, Timmy! Chicken, chicken, chicken pot! Chicken! Stop it, you two. Stop it! You leave him alone! Curtis, are you alright? Help me! Help me! Help me! You're sure you're ok? Are you sure? - Yeah, I'll be ok. - You... ok. - Thanks. - Ok. Can't even keep a promise for one day. Hi, Timmy. What are you doing? - Nothing. - Come on up here. No, I can't. I gotta get home. My sister will kill me if I'm late. You won't be late. It's only three o'clock. Ok. You still gonna have your birthday party tomorrow? Yep. - Have you ever played doctor? - No. Me neither, but I know how to play ambulance. - What's that? - A game. I'd rather play baseball. Phone's ringing. Do you want me to climb down and get it? No, it's probably just my dumb sister. She lives on the phone. Hey, whose book's that? Mine. - What's it about? - It's a secret book. - Like a diary? - Yeah. Well, goodbye. Bye. Timmy! Timmy! Timmy! What's going on here? Somebody tried to run me down in that car. Ok, let's... let's go down and take a look. There's nobody in here now. There was someone in there, and he's got a blanket over his head. A blanket? A blanket? - Yeah, he was trying to kill me. - Duncan! Wait, wait. Duncan - Goddammit, Duncan, where are you? - I'm here. Over. Ok. We've a call from Deirdre Wilson, across from the graveyard. - Thinks she saw a psycho lurking. - I got it, Dave. A call from cookie Lamar. A psycho was watching her, whilst she was taking a shower. A call from Brett. We have a suspect. A call from your wife. We have a suspect. A call from the mayor. We have a [expletive deleted] suspect. Meadowvale Police believe that the tragic death today of Meadowvale Elementary School teacher miss Violet Davis may be linked to the bizarre graveyard killings of two local teenagers earlier this week. - Police are working on the theory that... - Listen, Timmy, from now on I'm gonna take you to and from school, and I don't want you going anywhere by yourself. Timmy, in the house! I told you to get in here ten minutes ago. "Deceptiveness and deviousness are totally foreign to your nature. "You indulge in rash behavior, and you worry a lot." Now, who does that sound like? - Dad? - Right. "You're extremely concerned about your attractiveness, "totally confident, and enormously seductive." - You, right? - Wrong. - Beverly! - Yeah! You know, it's surprising how much you can miss someone when all they ever did was bitch at you, you know? Stop you from doing things. Jesus, it's hard to believe. A tough guy like your father. Killed via skateboard. Yeah. Little angel face was really careless. Here? - What if your mom comes home? - I don't care. I just want to forget. This is Debbie's chart. It's really weird. Because there was an eclipse the day she was born, both the sun and the moon were blocking Saturn, so there should be something missing from her personality. - Why? - Because Saturn controls your emotions and the way that you treat people. I think somebody's out there. Nobody's out there. It's ok. - Go look. Ok? - Alright. It's ok. What was that? There is somebody out there! No! No! I can't believe you read this stuff. Well, it's all true. Hey, Beverly... Beverly! Um... Do you know your little sister Debbie has been charging the little boys 25 cents to watch you undress? What? A peephole. Oh, no! I don't believe it! Joyce knows, and she's not going to keep quiet. - So what? - They might believe her. Not if they think she's crazy. - What are you gonna do? - You'll see. - Got it? - Yeah. Here you go. Curtis. Steven. Debbie? Now make a wish. Three really special children, aren't they, Madge? I would just like to say to you all how much I appreciate you coming here today to wish the children a happy birthday. Uh... There is... One person who is not here today. He would very much like to have been here today with us all. - It's ok, Madge, it's ok. Come on, everybody, let's have some cake, ok? It sure is wonderful to see everybody enjoying themselves, in spite of what's been going on. It is a relief to get out. You know, I've been afraid to leave the house lately. Are you any closer to catching this maniac? Well, we've got a few clues, but we ain't been able to focus on nothing specific. I'm scared to go out at night. Do you want to get another cake? These guys are eating like pigs. Curtis! You're making a mess. I'm gonna need another cake. Will you get me one? What's the matter with you? Look at that cake. What have you got behind your back? - What did you do? - Nothing. Oh, no! Don't eat that cake. Curtis poisoned the icing, don't eat that cake! Don't eat the cake! Curtis poisoned the... don't eat it! Curtis poisoned the icing. Don't eat the cake! - Curtis, he poisoned the... - I wasn't doing nothing. The poison was just sitting on the counter. I was putting it away. You were not, you little liar! Watch what you're saying. He never told a lie in his life. Hold on, Joyce. Exactly what did you see? I went into the kitchen, and he was putting icing on the cake. And he had a decorator in one hand and a bottle of poison in the other hand. You're crazy. Let me have some of that icing. - What are you doing? - Eating the frosting. The icing! You tricked me, didn't you? Didn't you? I eave him alone. You made me think that you put poison in that icing on purpose, didn't you? And you locked Timmy in the refrigerator on purpose, didn't you? Leave him alone! Come, get out of here. She's been upset ever since she found miss Davis. Curtis doesn't even seem to know the things he's doing are wrong. - It's like he has no feelings. - That's Curtis for sure. Maybe that's what's missing. His conscience. You stay here. Did you open up the door? What? Did you open up the patio door? No. Hey. - Paul! - Hey. What are you doing here? What do you mean, what am I doing here? - Aren't you glad to see me? - Yeah, I'm really glad to see you. Hey. Hey, what about your finals? I decided to take off. I missed you. I missed you, too. Timmy. Well, dad told you to watch out for me, right? - Right. - He told me to watch out for you, too. Well, why don't you watch out for me from inside your room with the door shut, ok? Hey. Are you sure you're going to be ok? Yeah. Just think of it this way... next year, we'll both be in college, and we won't have to worry about it. I'm not going to college. What do you mean? I've been doing some thinking. What I really want to do is be a reporter, not take a bunch of stupid classes. Look, I understand all that. You have plenty of time for that after college. With everything that's happened, it's really made me think. And from now on, I'm gonna do what I wanna do, not plan to do what I wanna do. Ok? Ok. Mmh. Debbie, did you take my nail Polish again? Debbie? You brat! That's my private property! Clippings of murders? What are you, some kind of little ghoul? I'm showing this to mom. Mom! Mom, look at this. It's not mine. Curtis left it here. I don't want Curtis coming here ever again. And I want you playing with him ever again! I'm sorry, mommy. Take this and burn it. Give me that, angel face. Hello? Come on over right away, and bring Steven. What are you doing in there, you little creep? - Why didn't you wait for us? - She asked for it. Beverly! Would you get the phone, please? It's just the wrong number, mom. Beverly's gone. Oh, ok. Thanks. Debbie? Debbie? Debbie, what are you doing? I spilt some nail Polish, mommy. Honey, you know you shouldn't play with Beverly's things. I'm sorry, mommy. Ok, but clean it up. I will hey. I'm sorry I got so mad at you earlier. Ok. "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. - "He leadeth me beside the still water." - Bev! "He restoreth my soul.” I never told you... I never told you how much we wanted you. I love you! "I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. "Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. "Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies." Ok. I'll be home in a couple of days, honey, alright? - Ok. - Ok. Thank you. Want me to fix up the sprinkler for you? No, I'll do it. Are you alright? Yeah. Hard to believe that, er... Beverly's not gonna come walking by. She'd like to be dead. You shouldn't think about things like that. Look, erm... why don't you go get the pruning shears, and we'll get this lawn cleaned up before mom and dad get home, ok? Alright. Come on, Maggie! Ready, I'm it. One, two, three, four, five... - It's jammed. Yeah, I bet Curtis gizmoed it. You don't even know what "gizmo" means. Ten. Tag! You're it. I beat you! My dad put in special glass! Get him! Don't! You'll hurt him! Let him go! - Hey! What are you guys doing? - He was throwing rocks at us! - You were choking him, weren't you? - No, we were just playing. You stay right here, and I'm gonna have the sheriff come over and talk to you. Go ahead and call the sheriff. After what you did at the birthday party, he'll think you're crazy. Let go of me! My grandfather will have you arrested for assaulting a minor! Hi. - My mom's back home. - Oh, great. She'll have to go see a shrink tonight. Can you and Timmy come over and babysit? Sure, what time do you want me to come over? - Seven o'clock. - Ok. It's bulletproof glass, you idiot. Joyce! Joyce! Stop! Timmy! Down here. Down here! We have to unlock the security system and get out of here. I'm gonna do it. The trunk, Timmy! Down! Timmy! Timmy, get away! Ok, let him in! Let's get sheriff Brody's gun. It's a replica. Should've learned to count to six, genius! Ok, hold him. Timmy, go to the Wilsons' house and call the police. Let me out! Yeah, I'll let you out when the cops get here. Mommy, mommy, Curtis and Steven did some terrible things, and Joyce is going to blame me, too. - Oh, sweetie, calm down. Now exactly what happened? Well, erm... Beth? Beth? Now, come over here. Now, what's your name? Beth Simpson. Alright. And remember, no talking to strangers. I won't, mommy. From now on, I'm gonna be your good little girl. Ok.
