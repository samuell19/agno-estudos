Cigarette smoking is injurious to health. It causes cancer. Cigarette smoking is injurious to health. Smoking causes cancer. Hi! - Hi! I am Deep. - Hello. I think I've seen you somewhere before. - Really? Yes. - Where? In my heartbeat. Can we dance? Sure. Can we spend some time together? Why not? - Really? Yes. - There will be just you, me.. ..and a bed. What? How dare you? My foot! Idiot! Excuse me. I didn't mean that. The word 'bed' just slipped out of my mouth.. ..and I messed up. Huh! Those are the words from your heart that.. ..slipped out of your tongue. - Keep quiet. Get me a beer please. Look at Arya. Sorry, I don't dance. Excuse me please. Hi! Okay. Cheers! - Cheers! Arya, every girl wants to dance with you. Let's go and dance with them. I just met a girl from St. Mary's. I have fallen for her. Let's go please. - Wait. Ask him to dance. - Why should I? Hey, dad has called up. - Shh! Yes, Dad. What? We've to go to Kolkata tomorrow morning? Why suddenly? No, I can't go all of a sudden like this. Dad, please. Dad, please try to understand. Listen to me... What happened? I have to go to Kolkata with dad tomorrow morning. Go then. You should go. - Yes, you should. You two also come along with me. No. - No. I, alone, will get bored over there. Please come with me. Why don't you understand? You two are my best friends. Only if he says yes. Okay. Hey, are you guys hungry? Should we stop for a round of tea and Samosa? - Not interested. Kolkata means traffic and crowd. Does this even mean anything? Kolkata's Durga Puja is absolute positive case for you. - Superb! Why did we come to Kolkata all of a sudden, Dad? Just wait and watch. You kind of forced me to come here. What is the case? Surprise. First you decide what you guys want to do. You can't waste time like this. Who will go to meet the sponsorers. Do I have to go? Did you inform the decorator to increase the height of the Pandal? No, none of you did that. Why do I... hey! Isn't that Banku? What's wrong with Banku? Borda (eldest brother)! Grandma! Boro Boudi! (eldest sister-in-law) Grandma! - Slow down. Why are you running? You will fall down. Forget running, I almost flew down here. What's the matter, Banku? Grandma, Mita's husband.. ..has come to their Kolkata house along with his son. I met the nephew of Nimai. He told me. What happened, Mom? Why are you crying? Why should we be bothered about strangers? What's the reason for your excitement? Get back to work. None of you should try to contact them. They don't have any existence in this house. This is the first house which I and your mom had built together. This house belongs to you. I know, all this might seem a bit strange to you. You have never come to Kolkata before. Let's go inside. Come along, you two. Hey, Piu, come out once. Where will you find her, Aunt? - What? - She isn't at home. The Durga Puja festival has started so she is.. ..out of the house most of the time. She is super busy these days. She is involved in the play, song and dance.. ..organised by the Durga Puja committee. She can be found on the Puja ground during any time of the day. No obstacle can deter me. No power of this world.. ..can separate me from you. I loved you the very moment I saw you for the first time. I won't be able to love anyone else in this lifetime. No one. Please send her to me once she comes back home. I need her help regarding something. Wonderful! Amazing! All your dialogues seem to come out straight from your heart. Isn't the script quite modern? Tell me. An all-girl historical play. All of you, do you nest. Let's rock Durgapur! What do you think? Very good. Malavika, why do you forget your lines everyday at the same point? I have to have an one on one session with you. Hey! Hey, sleepyheads! My friends form Mumbai, wake up! Wake up quickly. Hey, wake up, will you? Please, Dad. I am tired. Wake up now. Life is a magic. How will you see the magic if you keep your eyes closed? Hey, wake up! What's the matter? - Get ready quickly. Let's celebrate. Today is 'Tritiya' (third day of waxing moon). Your first night in Kolkata! Let's party, guys! - Oh, yes! Party! Get in the groove, bro! Bachelors party, right? - Yes. So? I mean, we three are definite bachelors. You are a kind of Bachelor too. What I am trying to say is.. ..don't you have any friends or girlfriends... What will you do with my girlfriends? - Oh... What were you saying? I mean, you girlfriends might have... Daughters. Is that you are trying to say? Yes... - You brat, I need to teach you a lesson. One tight slap is what you need. Go and get ready fast. - Okay. Get going. Listen, don't be a lech all the time. Look at you! Why are you still on bed? Arya! Arya, wake up, son. Wake up. Wake up, will you? 'Today I'll tell you everything, Arya.' 'Or else it'll be late.' Come along. - Were you looking for me for this? Come inside. Whom do you want to call. - Wait a while. This is the number. Please connect the call for me. Whose number is this? It's my grandson's number. I want to talk to him. Connect me to him, please. Your grandson? You mean aunt Mitali's... - Yes. But they live in Mumbai, don't they? Yes, they do. But right now they are in Kolkata. Grandma, it's ringing. Nimai, can you take the call. - Sure, sir. Hello. Yes, he is here. Hold on. Hello. Who is this? Biswadeep? Yes, mother-in-law. It's me. You remember my voice even after so many years. I want to talk to my grandson. Where is my Nanu darling? Hold on a moment please. Speak. Hello. My dear, won't to come to meet? She is your Grandmother. Speak to her. Hi Granny. How are you? I am good, dear. Come to me, won't you? I have so many stories to tell you about your mom. I never got the chance to tell you anything. Won't you fulfill my wish? Hello! Hello! My dear... Hello. Let me see. - Uh... He isn't talking. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me? Your grandma is requesting you to come here. Here in Durgapur. Hello. Give me the phone. Hello. Biswadeep, am I not going to meet my grandson before I die? Arya will go to Durgapur, Mother-in-law. I would have sent him even if you wouldn't have called. He will go. Impossible! Durgapur? There is no way that I can go to Durgapur now. I am already so bored over here. Dad, please don't do this. Is this why you lied to me and brought me here? You have to go to them. That's the reason behind our Kolkata trip. I would have sent you to Durgapur even if your grandma wouldn't have called. They are you kins. They are very close to you. For the last 20 years I couldn't say you something. I had thought that I will tell you once you grow up.. ..so that you can understand everything. Your mom's family didn't accept my marriage with your mom. Back then I used to do a job with a salary of 2,200 rupees a month. No one would want to have such a poor husband for their daughter. Since the day of the wedding, your eldest uncle(maternal).. ..disowned Mita. Why did you have to call them up? Did they ever care to check on us? Why did you call them? Mitali is my daughter. She is your only sister. Don't you have any feeling for her? I haven't seen... how big Mita's son has become. They haven't seen Arya before, have they? No. I wanted to take Arya to them but his uncle had prohibited me. So why are you asking me to go now? I have a fear, Arya. Who will look after you after my passing? There is no one else whom we can call our own. Please go. Go and visit your mom's family. They might not like me.. ..but you will be welcomed with open hearts. You are forgetting one thing, Mom. Biswadeep didn't even inform us about Mita's demise. How could you even think... My grandson will definitely come here. My grandson will come here tomorrow itself. If you get a chance to talk to your uncle then tell him.. ..that I has sent a message to them about your mom's demise. Those days there was no mobile phone. I had requested so many people. I had asked one person to deliver the message. But he had delivered the message much later. I was taking care of you all by myself. Taking care of you was more crucial than sending message to people. I had no one by my side then. I was so perplexed. I just held your tiny fingers and sat quietly being numb. Hey, Ryan. - Yes? Make me one more drink please. - Okay, Uncle. So ultimately what is being decided? Are we going to Durgapur's Markoni tomorrow? - Yes, my son. Weren't you saying that there is no thrill over here? Go and have an adventure at Arya's maternal uncle's place. You will find your mom, once you go there. We were not even supposed to come to Kolkata. So? - But we will be spending the Durga Puja festival at Durgapur. Why? Why? Why? You will understand tomorrow morning, once we reach there. "I became familiar with the roads.. ..as soon as I embarked on the highway." "The shops and markets are running beside us.. ..but we are not moving." "Let three plus three make six or nine.. ..today, in this wrong route." "The small town is left with us.. ..and we will see that through a long shot." "The thought and worries are on a holiday now." "We don't need any routine now." "Our desires are all of five star quality now." "We have reached the festival of light." "My heart is eager to move ahead." "This is the time for fun, frolic and psychedelic adventures." "The four wheels of the car are running on full speed.." ..and we are almost flying endlessly." "My heart, standing at the verge of desires.. ..wants to embark on a journey of love." "My heart decks up itself and looks for.. ..own self in the mirror of one's songs." "My heart, standing at the verge of desires.. ..wants to embark on a journey of love." "Let it tiptoe or run if it feels like.. ..being playful." "The wind is blowing in a random manner.. ..the heart also wants to take off and fly." "Let it tiptoe or run if it feels like.. ..being playful." "The wind is blowing in a random manner.. ..the heart also wants to take off and fly." "The thought and worries are on a holiday now." "We don't need any routine now." "Our desires are all of five star quality now." "We have reached the festival of light." "My heart is eager to move ahead." "This is the time for fun, frolic.. ..and psychedelic adventures." "The four wheels of the car are running on full speed.. ..and we are almost flying endlessly." Piu! You go ahead. I will come and join you. Here you are! All decked up and looking pretty. Do you remember about the rehearsal that is scheduled this morning? Are you planning to ruin the play? I am going to the rehearsal right away. Please don't be tensed. There is so much going inside my head. How can I not be tensed? Will you be happy if our play gets spoilt? Come to the rehearsal right away. I am going ahead. Okay? Hey, listen. How am I looking? Very pretty! But you should keep an eye on your husband. Why? I saw uncle Swapan sharing light moments with Jhumpa. I see! That's why he took so much time in the morning to dress up. He was so eager to come to the Puja ground as soon as possible. Now I will teach him a lesson. You are absolutely right, Piu. Did you see that? Go to the rehearsal. I will join you in a while. I have to end this today. I will lock him inside the bathroom through out the night. Were you flirting with her? You old haggard! Don't you feel ashamed? 'You will find your mom, once you go there.' Shampa! Sister-in-law! Come out and see, who has come! Who is Arya among you... I am Arya. I am your youngest maternal uncle. She is your eldest aunt. And she is your youngest aunt. Sister-in-law, just look at him. Doesn't he look like Mita? You resemble Mitali so much! Let it be. God bless you, my dear. You don't need to do that. Bring them inside. Mother-in-law is waiting for you since long. She is so restless. Come inside, all of you. Mom! Come and see, who has come to meet you. - Come inside. Why are you guys standing outside? Come inside, please. Come inside, my brothers. This is your room. Nice. Very nice. My brother! He lives in Mumbai. His Hindi needs serious treatment. - Please leave me, bro. Hey, have you seen Shahrukh Khan's bungalow? And Sunny Leonne? I have heard that she jogs on Juhu beach. - Never. Are Mallika's those ones fake? Which ones? I have already told my friends.. ..that my cousin is coming from Mumbai. They will become so jealous to see you all. Wow! What a nice Tattoo! Uff! And you have three earrings too! Lovely! Even your shirt is also so nice. You all should come.. ..to the Puja venue wearing this kind of clothes. Okay. - You guys have bath and get ready. I'll be back in sometime. After that we will have lunch together and then.. ..go to the Puja Pandal together. Okay, bro? Bye. Okay? - Bye. - Okay. He is a strange character! Who is he? - Arya, is that your cousin? 'My brother!' I had packed the right thing at the right moment. Excuse me. - What? - Why don't you all have bath one after another? I have kept everything inside the bathroom. - Okay. Okay. - Okay? - Yes. "When you pinched me..." God, you are great! Wherever I go, God sends a voluptuous lady in front of me. This is Arya's maternal uncle's place. If you get caught, your reputation will be at stake. Maternal uncle's places are fun. You don't get beaten up over there. - Where are you going? To the Puja Pandal. I'll give you one tight slap. Why are you running so much? I will go for the Olympic! Hey, Piu! Where were you all this while? I have kept Payesh(sweet dish) for you. Won't you eat? That's why I came here running. I am very hungry. Let me go and wash my hands first. Oh my! What nonsense! Couldn't she knock? How stupid of me! It's me who hasn't locked the door. Piu! Hey, Piu! Why are you going? Won't you eat the Payesh? Is that guy... There is so much food on the table. Aunt, how will we eat so much? Oh, Arya! We can definitely finish the food if we all try together. Isn't that Aloo-posto (Bengali delicacy)? He is right. Do you want me to believe that three of you.. ..can't finish this food? - A little more please. Besides, there is no one to feed you with so much care in Mumbai. You will definitely finish all the food. Hey! Why are you standing here? Come inside. Look at her. She wasn't coming inside since Arya and his friends are having lunch. Silly girl! Hey, Piu, what the matter with you? Your aunt had asked you to eat Payesh and you said that you'll eat.. ..after you wash your hands. Where did you disappear after that? Arya, she is Piu. Crazy Piu! She is your youngest aunt's niece. They live close by. And he is Arya. He is my sister's son. Hi! What happened? - I think the food is too hot for him. Have you eaten a chilli? - Give him some sugar or water. Slow down or else you will choke yourself. Drink some water. This is my cousin, Arya. He lives in Mumbai. This is his friend, Deep. Have you seen his Tattoo? Why don't you show them, Deep? And he is Ryan. Priyanka Chopra come to his terrace everyday to have juice. And Shahrukh Khan? - He is your cousin! Shahrukh cycles everyday behind his apartment. Why don't you tell them. - Yes. He is right. - Didn't I tell you? Katrina Kaif resides in the apartment beside his. - What? Once Deep had seen Katrina wearing just a towel.. ..and had fainted. Isn't it, Deep? - Uff! - Yes. He will surely faint now. Your brother is my brother. Let's take him to Mumbai. At the rate he is cooking up stories.. ..the film magazines will appoint him immediately. Hey, Bunty! - Yes? - Listen. What is it? Excuse me for a minute, bro. Arya, I will be back in a while. - Okay. My binocular lady! - Don't do this, Deep. - Wait and watch. Don't do this, Deep. Sorry! Hi! - Oh my! Who are you? Are you new in this neighbourhood? New. Young. Let the fire blaze! Fire can burn your hands. - Let them burn. Let them turn to ashes. What's your name, my lady? Her name is Jharna. Oh God! Who is he? He must be your uncle. I think he wants to say something to you. He is my husband. Bubla. Where is your water bottle? You haven't had water since long. - Water? Where were you all this while? You are perspiring. Am I? Hey, am I perspiring? - No. Rather I am perspiring. - Let's go, Jharna. I have told you so many times not to talk to strangers. Come along. Bye. - Okay. I will see you during the Puja. - Sure. What is your name? - Deep. I have come down from Mumbai. Hey, was he completely naked? Wasn't he even wearing a towel? - Stop it. I didn't know that there was someone inside the bathroom. That guy hadn't close the door. That's his maternal uncle's place. His name is Arya. Hey, you must be remembering the incident every.. ..time you are meeting the guy, isn't it? - Uff! You're feeling shy since you haven't.. ..seen any such thing earlier. - Yes. You must be quite habituated to see such scenes. - Keep quiet. There comes your brother. Why is he coming this way? Just look how he is coming towards us like a bull. Bro, come with me. You've got something important to do. Where do you want me to go? I have some personal problem. I can't solve it without your help. Today I need to see to the end of it. Come along. - Where do we have to go? Come along, will you? I need your help. I need your help desperately. - Arya.. I'm not getting into this. We'll be in trouble. I see! Do you think he'll be in trouble if he goes with me? How could you say that? - My brother.. ..my reading never goes wrong. We'll be in trouble if we go with him. Look, are you planning to get us into any trouble? Do you think you'll get into trouble if you go with me? Hey, let's go. Arya, where has your brother brought us to? Hey, do you have any plan of a robbery? She will be here any moment now. - Who will come? What are we doing here? There they come. Did you bring us here to show them? This is what we want. Don't say 'we'. This is what only you want. - Quiet! Bro, look at the girl in the middle. What are you doing? - Come with me once, bro. - Why? Please come. - What are you up to? - Please come with me. I need your help. - What are you up to? Didn't I tell you that Arya's cousin... Hi. This is my cousin, Arya. He lives in Mumbai. Now you can speak in English as much as you want. Hey, Bunty, what are you doing? I tell her 'I love you' everyday. He replies me in English every time. I don't understand anything. My English is weak since I was a child, you know? Now you say what you have to say. He is my cousin. He lives in Lokhandwala. Bro, why don't you tell her in English? - Keep quiet! None of you can understand what the other person has to say. And you want to have an affair with her? Don't try to reach out to the Moon. Hi. I'm Deep... from Mumbai. Many people must have told you that you've got beautiful eyes. But has anyone told you before that your eyes can.. ..become the 'best eyes' in Miss world competition? But I can't understand anything. You don't need to understand anything. Let's go home. You are so smitten by love, aren't you? Let me show you. Why did she blow a whistle? Who are these guys? Bro, who are these guys? Who is the culprit? - It's him. Your brother... - I will beat you up all today. Hey, wait. What you mean by 'all'? This is Bunty's personal problem. So beat him up. Arya! - Yes? - Let's go from here. Bye. - Greetings. Greetings. Bye. - Let's go, bro. Hey, where are you going? - Don't leave me alone, bro. How dare you tease my girlfriend? Are they beating him up? Hey, wait. Let's go from here. They are beating him up. There is no point lending a helping hand now. We'll also get beaten up. Let's go. - What are you saying? He is my cousin. How dare you come to our locality and tease our girls? Hey! Hey, Santosh! Bachchu! Guys from a different locality has entered our locality. Come along. Guys from a different locality are beating us up! They are the guys from a different locality. Did you say that we are guys from a different locality? Run! He is a very handsome guy. He looks like a film star. He seems a bit childish. Apparently he is very shy, quite, reserve and introvert. But he has a child within him. He was behaving like a kid when he had eaten the chilli. So you should bring up the kid. Weren't you saying that the air and the sky.. ..of this place seem a bit different to you? You were also saying that the festival.. ..this time seems a bit different to you. I think, during this festive season you'll surely fall in love. Keep quiet. Don't talk nonsense. Hi! Can you help me? Is my uncle's house this way? No, it's that way. Oh, I see. Thanks. Why don't you come with me and show me the way? Come along. Why is that guy? - It's him. Oh my! Really? Thank you so much. Apply the medicine now. It's bleeding profusely. MY poor child! Hurry up. Dress his wound. What is the necessity? You don't have to think about that. Let us handle this. Apply the medicine properly. Sorry. - Don't be afraid. It will be fine. Where is Bunty? Can't he stay with his brother? There he is! You, idiot! Don't you feel ashamed? Wait, I'll teach you a lesson. Let your dad come back home. I will ask him to smear chilli paste in your eyes. Let me see. Oh my God! - It's alright. Thank you. Grandma, you all can go now. I am alright. Thank you. I am fine. - Don't remove the cotton. Come, dear. Come along with me. You have gone too far. I'll teach you a lesson. - I'm done. Thanks. I'll teach you a lesson. Grandma always talks to me like that. But whatever you guys have done is just mind blowing. That why it is said.. ..that many brothers means more power. Hey, what do we do with him now? - What do you mean? Let beat the hell out of him. I haven't done anything. - Hey, quiet! Why did you take us with you? - Because of you... Stop hitting me. Look, bro, how your friends are hitting me. Why shouldn't we hit you? - Wait. Don't hit him. Let him go. Today, when you had ran away leaving me behind, I was very annoyed with you. If you were in my situation today, I would never have fled away. Do you know that? - You are a crazy guy. Do you know that? This is not the way to love someone. When a girl and a guy like each other, something happens within. A sense of emotion arises. And then being tall or short.. ..or being poor or rich or English medium.. ..or Bengali medium doesn't matter at all. Look at me. I've never felt any such emotion towards.. ..any girl so far, so I never had an affair. And I have no issues about it. Just forget it, bro. I will experience it when I'll fall in love. "Oh my heart, like a letter without an address.." ..be quiet and listen to me." "I want to whisper something into your ears." "I forget my daily chores.. ..when I hear of him." "Oh my heart, like a bee.. ..why have you forgotten your hearth and home?" "I want him so much that I miss him every moment." "I go closer to him in signs and symbols." "If my heart wants to lose itself then let it be." "If my heart wants to lose itself then let it be." "My heart is helpless today." "My heart is helpless today." "If my heart wants to lose itself then let it be." "If my heart wants to lose itself then let it be." "My heart is helpless today." "The misty air whispers.. ..who is going to bring the sweet Autumn?" "The misty air whispers.. ..who is going to bring.. ..the sweet Autumn?" "The ocean of my dreams helped me understand the depth." "My heart is restless so are my eyes to.. ..have a glimpse of him through the window." "My friends gossip that I am smitten by him." "I have opened my heart with the magical hope of leading him in.. ..as if a firefly in a distance wants to say something." "If my heart wants to lose itself then let it be." "If my heart wants to lose itself then let it be." "My heart is helpless today." My life is meaningless without you, Prithviraj. If I have to live this life without you.. ..then I would rather prefer death. I will give up my life. What happened, Piu? Why did you stop saying your dialogues? You were doing so well. I have immense hope on you about making the play a success. Hey, Malavika, come here. someone is singing." "He is familiar to me, yet, in an unfamiliar language.. ..someone is singing." Hey! Hey! Why don't you ask Tanuka to go from here? I think he will stay on the terrace for quite some time now. Ha she also fallen for you? Keep quiet. Look here. Here Prithviraj has become too emotional. Wait. Let me ask Tanuka to go from here. Sanyukta is about to give up her life. Don't you understand that? - I'm afraid, Tanuka.. ..you might also have to give up your life at this age because of love. What do you mean? Uncle Swapan had gone for a facial in this festive season. What? You didn't even realise that he is glowing. Whom is he trying to impress? Do you think it's for Jhumpa? Is Swapan having an affair with Jhumpa? God knows. How will I understand? He is your husband. You will understand better. But this is quite obvious.. ..that both of them seem to be smitten by love. I won't spare them. I will see to the end of it. Today's rehearsal is over. Aren't we going to rehearse any more today? - No. We won't rehearse any more today. Go and talk to him. - Go. You guys should go now. Let us know about all that you two will say to each other. Let's go. - Yes. Shall I spread the clothes for drying? No. Thanks. You have to squeeze out the water from the clothes properly. I can do it. It's quite obvious that you don't have the habit of drying clothes. I will make a habit of it. My aunts had offered to wash my clothes.. ..but I insisted on doing it myself. Anyway, when is the show of your play? It's two days after the Puja. Are you the female lead? - Yes. I am playing Sanyukta. Good. All the best. You just leave them. I will spread out the rest of the clothes. I already told you that I can do it. You were so reluctant to go to Durgapur. Now you seem to have forgotten your dad. I am sure you are enjoying a lot. Good. You have no idea how we are being treated over here. We are being forcefully fed day and night. So many different kinds of traditional sweets are being made. Didn't I tell you that maternal uncle's place will be fun? So, did you get to meet any girl... - Dad, please! The only obstacle is eldest uncle. He appears to be so grumpy. What do you mean? - I mean, he isn't talking to me properly. He seems angry all the time. Do you remember Manoj Khambe, my maths teacher? Uncle is somewhat like him. Actually he is annoyed with me. And you are my son. But everything will be alright. Listen, take care of yourself. And call me up at times. - Sure. Bye. The time is approaching. I have to tell Arya that my days are numbered. But how do I tell him? It will be too difficult to control him. Which one will look good on him. Let's see. See this. Isn't it nice? Very nice. Let's buy this. What do you think? Please pack this for me. Listen to me. Don't do this. You are looking so handsome. Just like a prince. Yes, Grandma, it's a bit long but that's okay. It's not too long though. Do you think this is a bit long? I won't wear this. What are you saying? You shouldn't talk like that. That's not fair, Grandma. I won't wear this Kurta. What? Who has bought... Piu, where did you bring this from? He is not wanting to wear it. Let me have a look. - This is too long. Okay. Give it to me. I will stitch it a bit and shorten it. Uff! Now we are really getting late. We won't get a place to stand inside the Pandal. You seem so eager to offer flowers to the Goddess. Keep quiet. You are just not understanding. Offering flowers is everything. I will stand beside Jharna and offer flowers to the Goddess. "Now that you have pinched me..." I think, Jharna will be an amazing experience. Experience of lifetime! May be tonight itself... - Deep, please keep quiet. Hey! Has Piu come back? - Where is she? Grandma, let me wear something else. Your tailor will be late. No, please don't say that, dear. Piu is very good at stitching. Do you know what a good girl Piu is? She is not only good in studies but also can sing and dance. She has got an award for stitching. Grandma, she is the perfect Bengali bride. Get her hitched with your grandson. One tight slap... Deep, where are you taking us? - Come along, will you? If Arya's eldest uncle comes to know, he'll beat us black and blue. Where are you taking us? We could have gone behind the Kul ground. No one stays that side. You don't even know the place. Bunty, I'll give you one tight slap if you talk much. Hold the bottles properly. Don't drop a single bottle. Come along. - He is right. Where are you taking us? Deep, listen to me. Don't make this a suspense thriller. Bunty had taken us with him without.. ..disclosing anything to us and we were in trouble. Come along. Trust me, guys. Just come along with me. This is Jharna and Bubla's house. Hey, Deep, why did you bring us here? Jharna has worshipped Goddess Annapurna. She has invited us for the 'Prasad'(offering). Stupid! Deep, can you share your plan with us? Wait. - Arya! - Wait. Deep! We offer our reverence to the elders. We offer our best wishes to our friends and juniors. Today we are going to present on this cultural stage... Hello, Jharna, we are waiting behind your house. Yes, we have reached. Do you want me to climb up to the terrace? Okay, I am coming. Deep, what are you doing? I have to climb up the wall to each the terrace. "We are the messengers of the new youth." Do you want us to drink at Jharna's house? If anyone comes to know, we'll be beaten up black and blue. Nothing such is going to happen. You guys will climb up to the terrace. And drink there. I will be downstairs, along with Jharna. "We are the messengers of the new youth." Can't you do this much for friendship, bro? You two are my childhood friends. You are getting us into trouble. - Hey, wait. I can't understand anything. We might drink on the terrace. But what will Deep and Jharna do downstairs? I should rather go and call Bubla. We all can chat together. Who has given you the permission to live in West Bengal? Just keep quiet! Hey, how are we going to climb up to the terrace? I am also thinking about the same thing. "We are the messengers of the new youth." "We make mistakes. We dive into deep waters.." "..and exert to find our way to the bank." "We make mistakes." "We dive into deep waters and exert to find our way to shore.." "We make mistakes." "Where ever we are summoned, even amidst a life defying storm.." "Where ever we are summoned, even amidst a life defying storm.." "...we are ready." What is he doing? - I don't know. Don't be shy, okay. Consider this to be your own house. Okay? - I might not consider this house to be my own. But I consider you my own. Will you come down, please? Sure. I am coming. There he is. Destiny is calling me downstairs. - Go to hell! Look, Deep, I am not finding this right. I am requesting you. Let's go from here. Jharna will be disheartened. She is a soft hearted woman. She doesn't say much. And her husband is someone like Bubla who is like a test cricketer. Jharna needs some blast in her life. Her player needs to come to the field.. ..during slog over and hit fours and sixes. You guys continue drinking. Enjoy yourself. If anything happens by chance, you can climb down the rear wall. Bye. Deep will be in trouble if Bubla comes back home. Why? Bubla bites when he gets angry. He throws whole bricks. - What? - He has a very good aim. Deep will be in trouble. Cheers, bro! - Cheers! Hey, what is this doing here? "Now that you have pinched me.." "..all over my body." 'Silly boy!' "Now that you have pinched me..." Please sit down patiently. Within a little while, we will start a new program. Come to me, please. - What? Come to me, please. - Catch me if you can. Let me see how you can do that. - Just wait and watch. Come to me, will you? Hey! What happened, bro? Are you tensed? No, no. Don't worry. I am enjoying, - Huh! I am really enjoying a lot. At my maternal uncle's place.. ..everyone is so good. Life is so smooth. Don't be tensed. He speaks in English when he is drunk. Everyone is so good, aren't they? If mom was alive today.. ..everybody would accept dad as one of their own. It would be more fun then, isn't it? Look at Bunty. I didn't even know him earlier. Now he is my brother. My brother! Cheers! - Cheers! Hey, I am getting pissed off now. Come closer, will you? What will you give me if I come closer? I have come here to give you my all. What a lech you are! I have noticed since the very first day. You are being so impatient. - I am coming to get you! Hey! I will get you! Hey! Who will save you now? What is the idiot doing downstairs? Cheers! - To hell with your cheers! Jharna! Jharna! Jharna! Jharna, where are you? Jharna! What happened? Open the door. What will happen now? - That means, his music program has got over. We are doomed now! Strange! - We are doomed! It's Bubla. Jharna! - Stop laughing! Jharna! Move away from the edge. - Jharna! Is she unwell? - I had warned you before. - Quiet! Bubla will throw bricks at us and break our heads. What happened, Jharna? Who has entered our house, Jharna? Hey! What's that noise? I am going to kill Deep. I promise! Deep! - Deep! I am feeling too tensed, Jharna. What's that noise, Jharna? Is that a cat? No, it's your dad! - Who is that? You idiot! - Sorry! - Okay, you guys go now. Quickly go away from here! Where did we climb from? Let's go. - Has anyone entered my house? Who is it? Be careful. - Let me get down. Jharna! Jharna! - Don't fall down, bro. - Jharna! Bro, we will get beaten up badly if we get caught. Run! Run! - Switch off the main. - Jharna! What happened? Power cut? No, it's not a power cut. Are there dacoits inside my house? Hey! Who's that? We will be beaten to death! I will take action against this. I will not spare anyone! Hey! Stop! Enough is enough. This happens time and again.. ..and we end up running and escaping. Isn't it, Arya? Deep! What is this? - He is a nice guy. Forget everything now. Smile now. What was Bubla saying? 'Jharna, what are you doing in the darkness? Is it dacoits?' Music? Bro, I think the function has started. Function? Let's dance. Are you going to dance? Why not? We all will dance. Are you sure? - Okay. Let's go. - Let's dance. Let's dance! "The spice of love has hit me." "O my love, I have fallen for you." "You play hide and seek with me but never come in front." "If you appear before me, I will slay you with my glance!" "Give me, Oh dear.." "..give me the assurance of your love." "Give me, Oh dear.." "..give me the assurance of your love." "The spice of love has hit me." "O my love, I have fallen for you." "You play hide and seek with me but never come in front." "If you appear before me, I will slay you with my glance!" "Give me, oh dear, give me the assurance of your love." "Give me, oh dear.." "..give me the assurance of your love." "Why do you bother about what your relatives say?" "Since we are in love, let's delve deeper." "Why do you bother about what your relatives say?" "Since we are in love, let's delve deeper." "My heart asks me all the time.." "..when will you recognise my love?" "Seeing your antics my heart sinks." "Oh my love, I am standing at your door." "Give me, oh dear, give me the assurance of your love." "Give me, oh dear, give me the assurance of your love." "Hey, listen, come closer to me." "I am unfriending everyone in order to get you." "Come to me and remove all the grievances from my heart." "I am unfriending everyone in order to get you." "Come to me and remove all the grievances from my heart." "Has any new film come to the town?" "I want to go and watch it with you and plant a kiss on your lips." "Your antics make my heart go wild." I am not feeling well. - Why? I'm just not feeling well. - What happened? What happened? Let me check. I am just not feeling well. - He has got fever. Fever? - Yes. - How come he has got fever? I am not liking anything. Let me go. Where are you going? I am going home. - Arya! - Let me go. Hey! - We'll catch up later. Arya! - Make way, please. - Listen. "If you appear before me, I will slay you with my glance!" "Give me, oh dear, give me the assurance of your love." Arya! Arya! Oh! He has got high fever! Arya! Mom! Mom! He has got high fever! Arya! Arya! Arya, what... What happened? - What are you saying? How did he get fever? Move aside. Let me see. - No, you don't have to come here. You better stay there. It was bound to happen. He isn't doing anything on time. He isn't eating or doing anything on time. Go and bring Dr, Baren. - Yes. Go at once. - Sure. - Give my reference.. ..and ask the doctor to come since our nephew has got fever. The fever is quite high. Why don't you change the water of the cold compress? Sure. - Does he have high fever? Why are you being so excited? We are giving him cold compress till the doctor arrives. It might bring the fever down. Hey, Son, did you have too much fun that.. ..you have got fever? Yes. Uncle was saying that I'm not used to.. ..the weather over here. Hence the fever. Besides, the weather becomes quite cold during early mornings. Today is Dashami. When are you planning to come back? I will be back two days later. And, listen, you just pack your stuff and come here. I want you to be here by evening. No, no, they won't like me going there. You won't understand. - Eldest uncle has asked you to come. Did your eldest uncle say this? - Yes, he has said this to me, Dad. Besides, my relations over here has shown me a different life, Dad. Grandma, uncles, aunts, Bunty... I feel that I am not alone. There is someone whom I can call my own. Besides, you have no idea how much eldest uncle loves me. He appears to be grumpy but he isn't. I really like hearing this from you. I have never seen you become so emotional before. Did you like any girl over there? The girls of Durgapur are really pretty. But the girl has to be of my liking. You can't just choose any random girl. Dad, please, just stop it. And listen, I will inform eldest uncle that you are coming. Okay? Bye. - Bye. Thanks. - Why? You all have done so much for me. Your fever has gone down. Actually, I was very much tensed. You had fever and you were drunk too. Piu, I am really sorry for whatever has happened that night. The first day I saw you, I felt.. ..did you come here for me? Do you remember the incident at the bathroom? I started liking you the very first day I saw you. I love you! Piu! Listen. What are you saying? Please don't see it that way. Whatever had happened that night... ..that was an accident. That was not love. I was intoxicated. I had fever. You could have stopped me. Why didn't you stop me? There isn't any love between us, okay? It was just something physical. I don't know, okay? I am sorry. It's a mistake. It's wrong. Sorry. We both have committed a mistake. Piu, please. What are you saying? - Why are you shouting? Did you sleep with her? I mean, did you literally sleep with her? I was not in my senses. I was drunk. Couldn't that girl stop me? Would you stop if she would have tried to stop you? You were drunk then, weren't you? You did without protection? Obviously. Do you think that I am like you? Is the girl going to do any scandal? We will be doomed if she creates a scandal. - It will be a scandal. You have to marry her if she becomes pregnant. What?! - Yes. What nonsense! - Listen, Arya.. ..we have to handle the matter quite coolly. You don't know how serious these small town girls are. Love is not a game for them. What are you saying? If she commits suicide then you are doomed. Are you mad? Girls don't suicide over such trivial issues these days. I am going home. - Hey, Arya! Didn't I tell you that I could sense trouble? I am calling you since long but you are just not answering. I have laid the food on the table. Come and eat now. Hey, Piu! - What? - Come and have food. I won't eat. I'm not hungry. Please go. What's the matter with you? What is it? Let me see your face. Were you crying? What happened, dear? Tell me, please. Hey, what happened? - Who... who was crying? I was not crying. Nothing has happened to me. Tell me please. Something must have happened. Nothing has happened. Please go from here. Please go. - Piu! Tell me, please... - Mom, please go. Listen to me. What happened? - I want to be alone, mom. Please go. Piu! Piu! What is she up to? Uncultured! Bad guy! He is very bad! Is making love called accident? 'Look, unprotected sex is always bit risky.' 'But... - And, yes, it can transmit various kinds of disease.' 'There are chances of pregnancy too.' Oh my God! What if something bad happens? It will be a disaster! What will I do now? Who should I talk to about this? 'If she commits suicide then you are doomed.' Piu! Piu! Hey, what are you doing? Please don't do anything wrong. We can talk about it, can't we? Piu, please. What are you going to do with a rope? I mean, we should talk, shouldn't we? Keep down the rope. Why do you need a rope? Piu! Hey, Piu! Why did you close the window? Open the window. What are you doing inside? Thank God! Piu, please listen to me. Unprotected... - Sex? Yes. - Piu, we can't do anything about what has already happened. I should have medicine. Why? - What if I become pregnant? All that happens in films, not in real life. But I am scared. Even if anything happens, I'm not being able to say this to anyone.. ..except you. If someone doesn't go with me, I won't be able to buy the medicine. I am too tensed. I don't know what to do. Will you please come with me to the chemist shop? Why? Don't you have the money? Sorry. I am sorry. Please help me out. I will never come in front of you after this day. Okay, I'll go with you. But promise me that you'll forget the incident after today. This is not love. It's an accident. Just forget it. And don't do anything embarrassing and get me into trouble. Promise me. Let's go. Yes? - Where are you, bro? Don't ask. I am stuck. Why? Has something already happened? I had to come with Piu to buy some medicine. Medicine? Has the matter gone so far? - Arya, bro, what have you done? Having a family at this age... - Keep quiet, you idiot! There is a medical shop that way. Go then. - Alone? You too come with me. - What will I do over there? I will wait for you over here. Go and get the medicine. Go. What do you want? This medicine... Hey, Piu! What medicine do you want? Is anyone sick at home? Don't you know Piu? Do you remember Manik of Markoni? She is his daughter. - Yes, I remember. She's all grown up. - What medicine do you want? Show me the name. No, it's nothing. - What? What's the point being so scared? Be brave. The man is known to me. He is uncle Soumen. He was at the medical shop. So what if he is known to you? You could have said that you are taking it for someone else. You can't be afraid of every trivial issues of life. Why don't you go to the medical shop? - What? Why don't you buy the medicine? There is a medical shop over there. Sir. - Tell me. I was looking for a medicine... Which medicine do you want? No... Actually... - Do you have a prescription? Do you have a prescription? No. - Hey, Sanjeev, didn't I tell you yesterday... Hey! What are you doing here? Yes. I need to buy antacid. Antacid? Why? Are you suffering from acidity? Hey, Sanjeev, give him some antacid. He is my nephew. - I see. - He has come down from Mumbai. I don't need antacid. Can you give me some Vicks? What exactly do you want? Vicks? Take it then. Here you go. Go now. Doesn't my nephew resemble my sister? Let's go from here. Why? - My youngest uncle was in that shop. Take this. What will I do with this? - I don't know, Come along now. We can't buy the medicine here. We can't buy the medicine in our neighbourhood. We have to go some place where no one would recognise us. We can go to Benachiti. How far is it? It's a half an hour journey. Are you hungry? Let me know if you are hungry. We can eat something once we reach Benachiti. I am not hungry. Let me know if you are hungry. You can't tolerate hunger at all. Piu, it's a trivial issue. Why are you so worried about it? Don't think so deeply about it. Come on, cheer up! Shouldn't I be worried? No. What there to be so worried about it? Come with me. We have to climb at the back of the truck. Here you go. Take this. What else do I need to bring? Here is your tea. Have you made the list already? Did you write Pabda fish? Yes, I have written it. Don't spoil it while cooking. Oh my! - I have written 'Mishti Doi' in the list. Biswadeep is coming to our place.. ..for the first time as the son-in-law of this family. We should leave no stones unturned to make him comfortable. Hey, where is Arya? I didn't see him since morning. Did he have his breakfast? He just got well. God knows what will happen to him now. No, mother-in-law, I have checked him. He doesn't have fever now. And he went out just a while ago. He has informed me before going. I see. Then he must have.. ..gone to the Puja Pandal. - Yes. Oh, listen, Kanai has delivered the mutton in the morning. Sister-in-law. Have you seen Piu? Her mom is looking for her. She went out in the morning without having breakfast. I saw Piu going towards Arya's room just a while ago. Why are you searching for them? The festival hasn't ended yet. Let the Festival end and then you can lock them down again. Just listen to him. What should I cook then? Should I cook Dal with fish head? Yes, of course. I have written fish head in the list. You can wear an iron bangle in your hand. How will people understand that you two are married? No, I mean... How much is it? - 80 rupees. Come along. Do you have any problem sitting with me? Oh! No. Bro, can you come here? What can we get to eat now? It's quite late now. You won't get anything veg and non-veg meal. Rice, Dal, fried vegetable, vegetable curry and fish. Should we take that? Give us two non-veg meal. Have a seat please. Have a seat. I will go and wash my hands and face. You are very good girl, Piu. I had misunderstood you. I'm sorry. When you were standing at the highway and crying.. ..it really broke my heart. I mean it. I will never inflict pain on you. I promise. Are you telling the truth? Start eating now. Will you eat my fish? Why? - I can't remove bone from the fish before eating. Why did you order for the fish then? There wasn't anything else. This is the non-veg meal. Piu, I think.. ..sooner we will come out of this situation, it will be better.. ..for both of us. So please cheer up. You look much better... - Please! You don't have to say anything else. The day you'll love someone but your love won't get reciprocated.. ..that day you'll understand what is happening inside my heart. For you this might be an accident but not for me. I am not repenting. I haven't done anything wrong. The person within you seemed helpless to me. I thought that you are not the person who is seen from outside. I have loved someone for the first time in my life. Don't belittle my love by calling it an accident. Please. Whatever has happened, has happened according to my will. You are not responsible for that. "How do I make you understand.." "..what all do I want? I have complain in my eyes.." "..but whom should I register it to?" "The signs and symbols have gathered." "God knows where does my heart wander." "All my calculations have gone wrong midway." "And the evening has set in silently." "The signs and symbols have gathered." "God knows where does my heart wander." "All my calculations have gone wrong midway." "And the evening has set in silently." "My shameless heart doesn't know how to hide it's feelings." "And the disobedient Moon smiles at me being amused." "My unruly heart.." ..doesn't want to believe the comfort of your lap.." "..beside my head." "My friendly heart, expresses silently.." "..who will approach first towards the fairy tales drenched in tears?" "The memories of walking together has gathered." "I have played with colours with my eyes being blindfolded." "I lost everything in the midway." "The hawker of the evening has returned home." "The memories of walking together has gathered." "I have played with colours with my eyes being blindfolded." "I lost everything in the midway." "The hawker of the evening has returned home." "My shameless heart.." "..doesn't know how to hide it's feelings." "And the disobedient Moon smiles at me being amused." "My unruly heart doesn't want to believe.." "..the comfort of your lap beside my head." "How do I see him?" "He isn't anywhere close to me." "My eyes are bedazzled.." "..by the spark from the stars." "The indulgences have gathered." "And it has started raining as well." "I am depressed for no reason." "Who is the one who has boarded a return bus?" "The indulgences have gathered." "And it has started raining as well." "I am depressed for no reason." 'This is not love. It's an accident.' 'Just forget it.' 'Piu, it's a trivial issue. Why are you so worried about it?' 'Don't think so deeply about it.' "Smiles at me being amused." 'My life is meaningless without you, Prithviraj.' 'If I have to live this life without you..' '..then I would rather prefer death.' 'My life is meaningless without you, Prithviraj.' "Beside my head." You came here for the first time. But what news did you bring for us, dear? Oh God, how much more pain will you inflict on us? Please don't cry, Mother-in-law. You will fall sick. Look, I don't have much time. At the most I have two years' time. So I had to say everything to you all. Brother, you might not consider me as a member of this family. But Arya is one of the members of your family. He is Mita's son. No, no, I don't remember anything. All that has been sorted out. Look, even we were also at fault. But if have sorted out everything by sending Arya to this house. You have cleared all the misunderstandings that were there. After my passing.. ..you are the only family that Arya will have. Now I feel that the mistake was mine. After Mita passed away, if I would have defied your orders.. ..and bring Arya during his childhood, then probably.. ..after coming closer to you all.. ..it would be easier for him to accept my demise. But... but Arya doesn't know anything about all this. I have heard that cancer has various treatments these days. And if the patient gets proper treatment.. ..then cancer can be cured. Specially.. in abroad... isn't it? That won't do any good, Sister-in-law. The doctor has no hope left. Now I am alive due to my will power. I am just wondering how to disclose everything to Arya. Dad! What are you saying? What are you saying? You are just making fools of us, isn't it? Why are you saying all this? Listen... Listen, Arya, you have to face everything. Why did I drag you here from Mumbai? You have grown up now. Look, I knew that you... Actually, I wanted that you should get back.. ..everyone from your maternal uncle's family so that.. ..so that after I pass away.. ..you shouldn't feel lonely. - Dad, please! Why are you saying all this? You must be making a fool out of me, aren't you? This is a lie, isn't it? Please tell me. You are lying, aren't you? Tell me, aren't you lying to me? - Listen, Arya... Say something. - It's true. I am telling the truth. Dad, please don't do this to me. Please! What a disaster! What are you saying, sister-in-law? Yes, Arya's dad has been diagnosed with cancer. He has told us as soon as he stepped into our house yesterday. Arya is crying profusely since he has heard the news. He has become so restless, you know? He hasn't eaten a morsel since last night. - Poor boy! Actually, since childhood he had no one by his side except his dad. He loves his dad so much. God knows what will happen to the boy. That's called destiny. He has lost his mom during his childhood. And now his dad is in such a condition. Poor thing! God knows what will happen now. Look at her! Piu! Oh, yes, hello. Can I talk to doctor... Hello! Hello! Arya, keep the phone now. All that won't be of any help. Why won't it be of any help, Dad? Why? Look at Yuvaraj Singh. He is back. I have my friends in abroad. We can use the internet. Dad, please, let's fight. Please. Look, Arya.. ..when I think that I have to go away leaving you behind.. ..my heart also breaks. Rather, as long as I am alive.. ..let me live for you. Let me live joyfully. Let me get you married. - Dad, please.. ..are you still in a mood to crack jokes? I am not cracking jokes. Look, after my passing.. ..you will need someone to take care of you and keep you organised. For that we need a girl. Okay, we will think about that later. But now you should eat something. You haven't eaten anything since yesterday. Who are you? Are you Arya's friend? Did you meet her after coming here? God bless you, my dear. I am Piu. I am the next door neighbour. Next door neighbour? I had watched a film when I was a child.. ..named, 'Girl next door'. Anyway, this friend of yours.. ..can't tolerate hunger at all. He hasn't eaten anything since last night. Just try if you can feed something to him. Please. I know what your dad means to you. It's very painful, isn't it? Even I was also in tremendous pain three years back.. ..when my dad had passed away. But, you can break down like this, Arya. Please don't cry. Your dad has no one else other than you. And you'll fall sick if you don't eat. Come on, eat now. What happened? Eat please. Dad will be fine, won't he? - He will be perfectly alright. Eat now. This time you go back to Mumbai, you'll have many responsibilities. Till date your dad has taken care of you.. ..but now you'll have to take care of your dad. You eat. I have to go. Piu! Thank you. I hope you are no longer annoyed with me. We are friends, right? Are you on Facebook? Please give me your number too. Shall I tell you something? You will be here till tomorrow. Seeing you so sad won't make me feel good. You guys could have gone tomorrow. The immersion of the Goddess will happen after tonight's function. My brother.. ..we will come again next year. - Promise me that you'll come. Promise me that you guys will come here. - Promise. I have to come. This time the Jharna affair remained unfinished. Unfinished? - Yes, unfinished. You could have stayed back for some more days.. ..and spend the Diwali with us. No, dear, that won't be possible. But now, we will keep visiting each other. And I have already handed over Arya.. ..to you all. Sister-in-law! - Yes? Please treat Arya as your own son. He has no one else other than you all. You don't worry at all. Everything will be fine, Biswa. Believe me. Are you saying that? - Yes. - Okay, I believe you. Bye, Brother. I believe that everything can't get destroyed so easily. It just can't happen. Even I also believe that. But what script the God is writing for me.. ..no one knows about that. Piu gave it to you. Piu? - Yes. Piu gave this one too. - Even this one? - Yes. Thank you. - Welcome. Arya! Let's go. We're getting late. We've to reach Kolkata. Is there anything else? Let's go now. Here you are. God bless you. Take care of yourself. Get inside the car. Bye, everyone. "How do I make you understand.." "..what all I want?" "I have complain in my eyes.." "..but whom should I register it to?" "The signs and symbols have gathered." "God knows where does my heart wander." "All my calculations have gone wrong." "And the evening has set in silently." "The signs and symbols have gathered."

'So I am not addressing you anything.' 'I started liking you the very first day I saw you. 'I love you!' 'You may pretend to be grumpy apparently..' '..but you are still a bit childish.' 'I hope from now onwards no one will have to remove..' '..bones from fish while you will eat.' 'You are not at all an emotional person.' 'It's good to be a bit emotional.' 'Or else you will inflict pain on many people through out your life.' 'For you this might be an accident..' '..but not for me.' 'I have deactivated my Facebook ID this morning itself.' 'It's not required anymore.' 'Even the phone number will also not be required.' 'We will never meet or talk to each other again.' 'You don't know how serious these small town girls are.' 'If she commits suicide then you are doomed.' 'We will never meet or talk to each other again.' 'For you this might be an accident but not for me.' 'You don't know how serious these..' '..small town girls are.' - 'I have deactivated..' '..my Facebook ID this morning itself. I haven't done anything wrong.' "Oh my friendly heart.." "..tell her silently, all that you want to say." "Who will approach first.." "..towards the fairy tales drenched in tears?' "The memories of walking together has gathered." "I have played with colours with my eyes being blindfolded." "I lost everything in the midway." "The hawker of the evening has returned home." "The memories of walking together has gathered." - Get ready quickly. Piu, take this bottle. I have filled it with honey. You have to perform very well in the suicide scene. Take the spot light on your face. Perform well or else the bottle won't register. Okay. And one more thing... Let me see how do you look. Wow! Perfect! You are looking very pretty. All the best. Are you all ready? We don't have any more time. Let's go. Piu, the play opens with you. Get ready soon and join us. 'My life is meaningless without you, Prithviraj.' 'If I have to live this life without you..' 'We will never meet or talk to each other again.' 'My life is meaningless without you, Prithviraj.' 'If I have to live this life without you..' 'We'll never meet or talk to each other again...' '...then I would rather prefer death.' Dad, stop the car. Please. What happened? - Dad, turn around the car. Let's go back to Markoni, please. Why? I have left behind. - What? Myself. I have left behind myself over there. Let's back please. - I can understand. Let's go. I have never claimed your love. It's not my nature to get anything by claiming it. I have just loved you with all my heart and mind. I am your Sanyukta. I belong to no one else. Are we never going to meet again? Will I never get to see your face? Please, Dad, drive fast. O Lord Krishna.. ..is this called eternal separation? I can sense something really bad is going to happen. I don't know why I have this feeling. Oh Angshuman! You are the saviour. You are the epitome of eternal youth. Is it time for me to bid farewell? Please drive faster! My life is meaningless without you, Prithviraj. If I have to live this life without you.. ..then I would rather prefer death. I will give up my life. Piu! Piu! Piu! Piu, please don't do this to me. Please! Piu, you can't do this to me. What were you doing? I admit my mistake, Piu, please! Piu, you can't do this to me. You can't leave me like this. Please, Piu. I didn't have that emotion within me earlier. But now I know what mistake I was going to commit. Please, Piu! Piu, please! Piu! I am admitting my mistake. Please don't leave me. Piu, I love you! You... are you telling the truth? "My shameless heart.." "..doesn't know how to hide it's feelings." "And the disobedient Moon smiles at me being amused." "My unruly heart doesn't want to believe.." "..the comfort of your lap beside my head." Thank God, finally your life is set. I ruined your play, didn't I? Sorry! Actually after reading your letter I felt that.. ..something bad is going to happen. Piu, why are you crying? Everything is fine now. I would have died if you wouldn't come. If you were a little late... - Piu! I was just not being able to live without you. I was feeling terrible pain within. I didn't know what to do. So... - So? Did that bottle really contain... "And the disobedient Moon smiles at me being amused.' "My unruly heart doesn't want to believe.." "..the comfort of your lap beside my head."
