Hey, y'all! Come on over here. I wanna show you something. What do you got? A little surprise. What is it? It's one of them, uh... I don't know... Sea "enemies." See enemies... Oh, yeah. We were looking for those over there. Where? Under there. SUZY: Yeah. You know, I've seen those things on those Jacques Cousteau television shows. JOE: Weird, isn't it? SUZY: Yeah. See, a fish gets attracted to them wiggling arms, and then he gets stung. And then the arms feed him slowly into the mouth to be digested. Very interesting. Yuck. Watch this. No, don't put your finger in there, honey. Don't worry now. I done this lots of times. (LAUGHS) There. See? It's nothing. Ow! What's the matter? Yeah, I don't know. I just felt this kind of a... Hey, I can't move my hand! It's eating my finger! Hey! Hold on! Oh, my God! Hey, Edna, get a knife. A knife? Wait a minute. I think he's letting go. What... (GROANING) He... Oh! Ow! (GASPING) (LAUGHING) Hey. You know, that's real cute. (LAUGHING) Very cute. You're so full of shit. Hey, Edna. Where are you going? JOE: Come on. EDNA: Boys will be boys. You know what I'm gonna get Joe for his birthday? A new car. SUZY: What kind is it? It's a Triumph TR7. It's burgundy. Hey, Ed, those are really expensive. Well, I have this insurance policy, see? And I saved some, too. And the rest only comes to $237.45 a month, and I can make that easy out of my salary. So... (LAUGHS) He's just gonna flip. Yeah. (EDNA MOANING) (EDNA CHUCKLES) JOE: Hmm. (MOANING CONTINUES) EDNA: We should go to the beach more often. (JOE CHUCKLES) It does something to you. JOE: Yeah, you too. (EDNA CHUCKLES) (BOTH GRUNTING) (SIGHING) RADIO ANNOUNCER: The time is 12:20. KLAX radio continues with music out of the past. Hey, it's tomorrow. Happy birthday. (GROANS) Don't remind me. That's another one down the tubes. (MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) Hey. Hmm? Why don't you turn back over here and give me a kiss? No. I'm all kissed-out. You are? Mmm-hmm. I'm not. Well, you know, you can't beat a dead horse. (LAUGHS) Are you sure? Hmm. Well, let me see now. Oh. What is this? (CHUCKLES) Hey. I definitely feel life in that horse. Think there's a little bit left in there? Uh-huh. I think so. (CHUCKLES) Oh, yes. And that is not a dead horse. (LAUGHS) Come here, you. Oh. Look at all that. Happy birthday. MAN: No way. MAN: Whoa! Look at that! Oh, you gotta be kidding, babe. (EDNA LAUGHS) Why don't you get in and find out? (LAUGHS) Come on. Wanna get in the back? You sure got it. (GIGGLES) Oh, I don't believe it. (LAUGHS) How can we afford to pay for this? Now you let me worry about that, okay? Oh. (LAUGHS) Happy birthday, honey. JOE: Yee-haw! EDNA: Do you love it? JOE: Love it. Love it. Love it! EDNA: (LAUGHS) It's got a synchromesh box. JOE: I could say something now, but I won't. You just keep your eyes on the road. Oh, yes, ma'am. Isn't it great? Oh, is a pig pork? Is Paris a city? Do fat babies fart? (LAUGHING) Oh, honey. EDNA: Hey, we'd better go back. Don and Suzy are coming at 7:00. JOE: Oh, great. That is great. (EDNA LAUGHING) JOE: What a great day. What a great present. What a great birthday. What a great wife. I mean it, babe. You... You really are great. (LAUGHS) Well, that's great. I think you're great, too. (BOTH LAUGHING) Joe, watch out! (TIRES SKIDDING) (EDNA SCREAMS) (GLASS SHATTERING) (ENGINE RUMBLING) (SIRENS WAILING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (EKG BEEPING) (AIR HISSING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (BEEPING INTENSIFIES) (CRASHING) (MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (EKG FLATLINING) (CRASHING) (EDNA SCREAMING) (EKG FLATLINING) (BELLS CHIMING) (ELECTRONIC HUMMING) (HUMMING INTENSIFIES) I'm Dr. Herron. Welcome back. Joe? Gone. I'm sorry. No. You won't be able to do that for a while. You've had some damage to your lower back. We had to operate. DR. HERRON: The bandage on your head... Well, that's mostly scrapes and bangs. Nothing too serious. EDNA: Why can't I move my legs? DR. HERRON: There's a blood clot on your spinal cord. We've relieved most of the pressure, but it's still there. In time, it may go away on its own, but there's no guarantee. And the main nerves in both your legs have been severed just below the knee. A piece of the car frame. Done some patchwork, but... EDNA: That won't go away? Ever? DR. HERRON: No. I'm sorry. EDNA: So am I, pal. Hello, Dad. Edna Mae. How's Grandma and Uncle Ely and everybody? Fair enough. They all send their best. Oh, thank you. We had, uh, a good harvest this year. That's good. But the price of fertilizer and diesel set me right back even. Hardly worth the effort no more. Them friends of yours, the Krolls, nice folks. They helped me with the funeral and all. Figure what you'll do when you get outta here? There's a lot to think about. Country's a good place to think. Why don't you come back home? If you don't wanna stay with me, plenty of kin be glad to have you. You're gonna need some looking after. It's just an idea. Suit yourself. Ah, I best be going. Let you get some rest. Dad? Maybe I will come home. For a while anyway. Heck, I still had all kinds of things to say to you. Suzy was helping me clean out the closets, and she handed me that old peat coat of yours. I started smelling that old coat, Joe, and... It was you. You know, everybody has their own smell. You know, just their very own. Do you know what I mean? Yours is kind of a combination of, uh, apples and... That old army pup tent we used to go camping in. (SOBBING) I'm glad you liked the car, honey. I'm real sorry it turned out like this. (SNIFFLING) I haven't cried very much. It's really got me puzzled, 'cause I... Love you so much. (SNIFFS) (WHISPERS) Goodbye, sweetheart. Oh. Where are we? Just east of Needles. Coming into Oatman. I had this crazy dream. (COW MOOING) (CHICKEN CLUCKING) (HONKS HORN) (DOG BARKING) (HONKING) MAN: Yeah! Yeah, I can hear ya! I'm a-comin'. Just hold your horses. (MAN HUMMING) Get down, boy. Get down. Ruff, get down. Howdy, folks. What'll it be? JOHN: Fill it with regular. Well, coming right up. (SINGING INDISTINCTLY) Kansas, huh? That's a long ways. I never been to Kansas, but, of course, there's a lot of places I never been. I'll get there. Someday. You ever been to Machu Picchu? I don't think so. It's in Peru. I seen it in the National Geographic. This whole city's built on top of a tall mountain. You wake up in the clouds every morning. It's really something. Well, I hope you get there. Oh, I'll get there. It's just a matter of when. You really got a two-headed snake? I sure do. Wanna see it? Mmm-hmm. Cost you a dime. (CAR HOOD SLAMS) Okay. (SINGING) You just step right in my office here. Um, I have a little problem here. No problem at all. You just sit right there. (BARKING) Hiya, Ruff. You dog. Get down, Ruff. Ooh! I've only had her a couple of months. She come a-crawlin' out from under the porch there. It's a miracle. I call her Gemini. Both them heads can eat. Oh. Mmm-hmm. You can pet her. She ain't poisonous or nothin'. Go ahead. (LAUGHS) Go ahead. Yeah. Oh. ESCO: The Hopis say the snake's a symbol of mother earth. EDNA: Uh-huh. Yeah. Ain't she a sweet thing? Yeah. (RUFF BARKING) Get down, Ruff. I think she's getting nervous. I... I best put her up. Okay. Thank you. My pleasure. (CHUCKLES) JOHN: How much do I owe you? Well, uh, let's see. $12.90 and 10 cents for the snake. ESCO: Hey, I got a humdinger of an Indian story. It's guaranteed to curl your toes and keep you awake for a week. Fifteen cents. We got a lot of driving to do. Yeah. Don't we all. Well, it was nice meeting you folks. You come back and see me. My name's Esco Brown. I know I'm a little gabby, but interesting. Bye, Esco. Mmm-hmm. Arriva derri. "Go purefully with peace in your heart, "love in your eyes and laughter on your tongue. "And if life don't hand you nothin' but lemons, "you just make you a bunch of lemonade." (CHUCKLES) Book Brown, chapter one, verse one. (ENGINE STARTS) Thank you, Esco. Hmm. Bye. Bye, Ruff. (RUFF BARKING) (INDISTINCT) (CONTINUES BARKING) Here, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick. Here chick... Crazy old coot. Joe and I came through here on our way to California. It's pretty. It's still hard for us to talk, isn't it? What would you like to talk about? (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING) Edna! Is that you? It's me, Grandma. Hi, Edna. Hi. Let me look at ya, child. Open the door, you idiot, so that I can get at her. Yes, ma'am. (LAUGHS) My, oh, my. Just look at you. You get the chair in the back. Why don't I carry her in? Oh. Okay. Fine. Thanks. You wanna take those, Granny? Careful! Don't you drop her! Oh, look. There's Mom. Yes, that's my oma... When she was 18. Hmm. God rest her sweet soul. She was so beautiful. Inside and out. (SIGHS) Wait a minute. Who's this? Let me see. That's Bill Condon and Don Stratton. Bill had the grocery in Goliad. Used to give you free candy every time I took you in. (CHUCKLES) Don was the blacksmith. Used to come here to shoe before John got tractors. They was great friends. Used to go huntin' up in Nebraska way. (CHUCKLES) Got caught in a flood... Just outside Ogallala. Drowned. EDNA: I know them. PEARL: Why, you couldn't remember, child. (CHUCKLES) You was only two and a half at the time... Oh, there's your brother Sam... When he come home on leave. Just before going over to Vietnam. So many crossed over. (SOBBING) I'm dumb to bring this out. Plain stupid. (SOBBING) Ah. (TAPPING) EDNA: They do this sometimes. It doesn't mean anything. At first, I thought they were coming back... (SOBBING) Oh! There, there, child. That's... That's the way. (SOBBING) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) EDNA: So, sure enough, he brought it out and it was a real two-headed snake. It really was. I never saw one before in my life. I even petted it, you know. Then he put the top back on the box, and that was that. Aw, you're just kidding us. Uh-uh, Lester. I never heard tell of a two-headed snake. Yeah? You don't believe me, go ask Grandpa John. That's a good story. Thank you. Go on, both of you! Go ask him! You'll see. All right. Hey, cousin. How doin'? Hi. Okay, Kathy. You know, I've been away so long, I just don't even know who anybody is. What a brood. (LAUGHING) I'll have a seat. (SIGHS) KATHY: That's Doc Lurkins. He's playin' horseshoes all by himself. 'Cause he cheats so bad, nobody'll have anything to do with him. Beaulah Hamby and Serina Garland, the gossip sisters. Do nothin' all day but suck coffee and dish dirt. Ada and Earl Carpenter. They bought the Foley place about 10 years ago. They're from West Virginia. Holy Ghosters. She's nice enough, but... He's hell on wheels. He's kind of a... Self-styled parson. Ah. Fire and brimstone, hell and damnation. All that kind of stuff. (LAUGHS) Doesn't seem to affect their son Cal though. (GRUNTS) Now there's a piece of work. (LAUGHS) EDNA: And who is that? KATHY: Clancy. EDNA: What's the matter with him? KATHY: Last year, Grandpa John strung up some jerky, Clancy pulled it down and ate it all. Grandpa John whupped him with some harness and he's been like that ever since. Grandpa John says it's so. Yeah. He says it's so. See? I told ya. I've even heard tell of a two-headed cow. Bull! (GASPS) Bull, bull, bull, bull, bull. KATHY: Oh, my God! (CRYING) Jack! Jack! She's got one! Jack, she's bleeding! Doc! JACK: It's Lizzie! Look, bring my bag. Kathy, it's just a nosebleed. No, she's had it before! It doesn't stop and we've had her in the hospital! She's a bleeder! Now, now, now, now, now! Lizzie, you're gonna be all right. (LIZZIE WAILING) Honey, the doctor's here now. DOC LURKINS: Get her feet up. (LIZZIE CRYING) WOMAN: Put some ice on her neck. Put some cotton in her nose! She's gonna be all right as soon as I get some coagulant in her. Damn! Damn! I don't have any with me. All right. Let's get her into Ellsworth. Jack, you drive my car. Buck, you follow us in. Kathy. Kathy, let me have her a second. Now, Edna, you can't help her. Please? Let me just hold her a second. Yeah. Come on. For just a minute. Why? (CRYING CONTINUES) Hey, Lizzie. Now that's just a little ol' nosebleed. (CRYING) That's all. Hey. Do you know, "One, two, button my shoe"? Do ya? I'll tell ya what. We'll say it together, and I promise you, by the time we get to the end, this nosebleed's gonna be all gone. (CRYING) What do you say? I'll make a deal with you. If we get that far, I'll give you 50 cents. Okay? All right. Let's go now. One, two, button my shoe. Come on. No 50 cents. Three, four, open the door. Three, four, open the door. Five, six, pick up sticks. Five, six, pick up sticks. Seven, eight, we're at the gate. Seven, eight, we're at the gate. Could I have a handkerchief, please? (LIZZIE SOBS) Thank you. Nine, ten, you big, fat hen. Nine, ten, you big, fat hen. Here you go. Look at that. No blood. (CHUCKLES) What do you think of that, huh? Here you go. Go to your mama. Uh, Daisy, would you go get 50 cents out of my purse on the dresser in the bunkhouse? What's the matter? What did you do? Oh, she was scared is all. She's okay now. Aren't you, sweetheart? Damnedest thing I ever saw. Aw, come on. You make me feel like some kinda bug or somethin'. Why don't y'all go back to what you were doin'? Give me your hands. Why? Do like I say. Give 'em here. They're hot. Hot as a stove top. Feel 'em. Now mine are, too. What's it mean? Grandma? I'd best go and see if Kathy needs me. ALL: Bye! Bye, Grandpa! Bye, Grandma! Bye! It's so beautiful seeing those kids. Hurts a little, too. You know, it's just a terrible thing, Grandma, wantin' them so bad, and not being able to have 'em. John told me you kept havin' this dream on the way here. Tell me about it. Well... I'm in this dark tunnel, and... And there are other people in there with me, but I can't really see their faces. And there's bells and chimes. And then, all of a sudden, I'm moving backwards. Is there a bright, beautiful light at the end of the tunnel? Yes. And the people, they... They seem like they're helping you toward it? Uh-huh. And then, when you're a-movin' back, away from it, you start to feel bad... And there's this, this buzzin' starts, and suchlike as that? Wait a minute. Yes. Yes, that's right. Grandma? Just before we come here from Georgia, I knowed a woman from Macon, Harriet Eller. Got pneumonia. She upped and died. For more than 10 minutes, nary a breath outta her. And then, just as they's ready to... To carry her down to the ice box, she comes back to life. Child, it was just like you been sayin'. Anyways, not long after that, she started curing folks thereabouts. Maybe... (SIGHS) This here accident of yours... Don't know. Could be the power done opened itself to you. I can't believe that, Grandma. Oh. Don't matter what you believe. The Lord moves in mysterious ways. We don't have nothin' to say about it. (HORSE NEIGHING) Now that's a mighty pretty sunset, ain't it? Pretty as a picture. Well, what the hell, Edna Mae. Crazier things have happened. Okay. There. Feel that? Now, tell you what we're gonna do. Why don't we stand up? Huh? What do you say? Why not? Up! (GASPING) Okay. Right. So what we're gonna do now is we're gonna take a step. All right. Easy does it. Just... Now. (GASPS) Hold on now. Oh... Oh! Ow. Shit. Serves me right. (SIGHS) (SCRAPING NOISE) (SCRAPING CONTINUES) Well, look who's here. I was just needing a friend right about now. Come on in. Hey, you wanna stick around for a while? I could use the company. Well... Might get a little weird around here, but the couch is comfortable. I make a hell of a bowl of chili. How 'bout it, pal? (GRUNTS) I gotta make all the parts strong. Especially the gut. (GRUNTS) Gut's real important, Clance. All right. That's one. That's one. (BREATHING HEAVILY) And one. (EXCLAIMS) (WHIMPERS) (GLASS SHATTERING) (KNOCKING) JOHN: Edna! Edna! I'm okay. I just fell. I'm fine. If I get in any trouble, I'll holler. Okay, Dad? (CLANCY WHIMPERING) (SCOFFS) What are you doin' under there? Listen, buddy, you can't be chicken-shit about this. It could go on for a while, you know. (THUNDER RUMBLING) I can heal myself. I can. I can. I can. I can. I can. (CLATTERING) (CLANCY WHIMPERING) (GASPS) I... (WHIMPERING CONTINUES) (GRUNTS) (GASPS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Okay. Now move. That's it. Come on now. No more... No more foolin' around. Just... Move! Toe. (SHOUTING) Move! (VOICE BREAKING) That's it, Clancy. I give up. I can't do it. There's not enough juice, I guess. (CAN CLATTERS) (FLY BUZZING) Go on. Fly. Scram... Do that again. I dare ya. I double-dare ya. It did it! Come here, Clancy. Come on. I need a witness. Now watch. See. You tell me if you see what I see. Watch. There! Did you see that? Did ya? (BARKS) You did? I did! (BARKING) (LAUGHING) (BARKING) (BARKS) (IMITATES BARKING) (LAUGHING) Yahoo! My toe moved! If that's you, God, thank you. (LAUGHS) Or whatever great, wonderful power that you are in the universe, thank you! I can move my toe. Doc, you're gonna love this. Okay. Now I want you to notice that I'm not wearing my braces. Okay? And, Jack, when I stand up, you pull the chair back. Okay. Give me my canes. Thank you. Okay. Here we go. All right. Pull 'er back. (SIGHS) All right, Doc. Now you take that cane and give me room. Okay, now the leg to watch, folks, is the right leg. The right leg, right? Here we go. (LAUGHS) PEARL: Oh! Okay. Now wait. That wasn't the hard part. Here's the hard part. Okay. Take it, Doc. (ALL EXCLAIMING) (CHEERING) (LAUGHS) (ALL EXCLAIMING) Oh, my! Hey, Doc, you wanna dance? (ALL LAUGHING) Carrie, give me that pin. (LAUGHING) DOC LURKINS: Now you turn your head away. Okay. You feel that? Yes. DOC LURKINS: That? (LAUGHS) Yes. That? No. That? Yes! Yes, yes, yes! They're comin' back! Aren't they, Doc? I believe they are, Edna Mae, but I'm damned if I know how. (LAUGHING) Dad, it's wonderful, isn't it? I expect if you get to walkin', you'll be leavin' again. Well, that thought isn't on my mind right at this moment. PEARL: The power's a gift, child, to be used and shared. It's God's work, Edna Mae. You know, when we were driving here, Dad and I passed this gas station that had a sign that said, "God is love and versa visa." I don't think I really know anything about God. But if love is God, guess I could try, Grandma. Doc Lurkins says it's spread to my spine and hip bones. Aw, heck, Kelly. What's the use? Ain't gonna do no good. Oh, Papa. Ain't gonna do no harm neither. Is it? Ned... (KNOCKING ON DOOR) MAN: Edna? Yes? Edna, it's Buck. I got Cal Carpenter outside. He got in a fight with Buddy Jones down at The Red Gap and Buddy pulled a knife. We was headed for Ellsworth, but the way he's bleeding, I don't think Cal would make it. CAL: * We are on the wind-swept desert * I thought since you stopped Lizzie's bleedin', maybe... (CAL CONTINUES SINGING) (CAL GRUNTING) Give her a hand, Clyde. We wrapped him up as best we could. He won't stop bleeding. His stomach's cut bad. Hey, Clyde, old buddy. That's real neighborly of you to get your old buddy a date like that. Hello, sweet stuff. Hey, Buck. Get a bottle and give her a drink. Shut up, Cal! Edna's gonna try to help ya. Oh, is that a fact? Well, come here, darlin'. I can help you, too. You know, we can sort of help each other. Can't you hold him? (GROANS) BUCK: He's fainted. Thank God. BUCK: Edna, you think you can do anything? Shh! Hush up, Buck. (SIGHS) Can you get me a towel? (DOOR SLAMS) It stopped. Yeah. For the moment, anyway. But get him to Ellsworth as quickly as you can. My God, Edna. Just get going, huh, Buck? Could I wash up? Sure. (ENGINE STARTS) EDNA: How long has he been deaf? WOMAN: Twenty-one years. He had a throat infection. And the doc gave him streptomycin, and it just went. EDNA: You know, Harve, I think it did some good. Can you hear me? (GASPING) Yes. I can hear! I can hear! I can hear! Oh, it's a fake. She rehearsed him. No! No, it isn't! I heard her. I can hear you! Attaboy, Harve! Hey, Harve... If you can hear me, what's the best thing to put into pies? Your teeth. (ALL LAUGHING) What's the worst weather for rats and mice? When it rains cats and dogs. (ALL LAUGHING) Thank you. (SNIFFLING) Thank you. Good night, everybody. (APPLAUDING) Stop right there, Edna Mae. Earl, don't. Sit down, woman. Be silent. EDNA: Yes, Earl. What is it? EARL: I've been watchin' these healings of your'n, and you ain't never mentioned scripture, nor the Holy Ghost once. Now what is the source of this power? I don't know. Oh, I think you do. And maybe the reason you don't name it is because it comes from another place. And where might that be? Hell itself, Edna Mae! Because if this were the work of the holy spirit, you would speak his name. You couldn't hold back, because he'd be speakin' his own name through you! I tell you this, woman. Even though you heal 100, 1,000, 10,000... These works are damned! Isaiah! Isaiah speaks it plain! Your hands are defiled with blood. Your lips are spoken lies. And Matthew says... "False prophets will arise and show great signs and wonders, "so as to lead the people astray." Good night, everybody. (APPLAUSE) "But only in my name... "My name... "Will the true believers cast out demons." "Your hands are defiled with blood!" That's cute. Well, Pop is really something, isn't he? Oh, yeah. You two make a great pair. Well, you should've stayed. He was just gettin' warmed up. He still had Jeremiah and Ezekiel to go. I heard enough, thanks. Hey, I gotta ask you. Did you really do that? What's that? Stop me from bleedin', I mean. Well, let's put it this way, you stopped bleedin' and I happened to be there. If you wanna connect up the two, that's up to you. Fair enough. How's about havin' a drink with me? (SCOFFS) No, thanks. I've had enough of your family for one day. Hell, that ain't fair. You blamin' me for old hellfire in there? I just came here to say thank you. Come on. One drink. Unless you're afraid of hurtin' your image or somethin'. My image? You're not afraid of me, are ya? Why don't you tell me about that fight you had. Nothin' to tell. Turkey's doin' two-to-five right now. Well, was it over a woman? (CHUCKLES) Now why would you wanna know that? I was just curious. Curious, huh? Look, come on. Let me buy you a drink, okay? Just so as I could say thank you. Won't kill ya. Okay. One thank you. Good. I'll meet ya at The Red Gap, okay? (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Was he always like that? Yeah. When I was 13, I had to learn Matthew, Luke and John, chapter and verse, to the tune of his razor strap. No wonder you get into fights. (COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING) Yeah. The old boy is really something. They broke the mold after him. In fact, they broke it over his head. Hey, you know I got 52 stitches? Really? That's just on the outside. You wanna see? Not particularly. Here. Let me show you. I don't wanna see. Hey, fellas! Ol' Cal is showin' his stitches again. Hey, Buck. Ol' Cal is showin' off his stitches again over there. (LAUGHING) Hey, shut your faces, you ignorant clowns. This is what comes from mingling with lowlifes. You said it. You know, I got a theory about all this healin' stuff. Oh, yeah? Yeah. I seen a lot of it. The old man was haulin' me and Ma around to tent meetings before I could even walk. You know, West Virginia, Tennessee, Missouri, Oklahoma. See, my theory is that... Them that's cured has got the sickness in their minds. Oh. And then somebody comes along and prays over 'em, and lays the hands, you know? And if they believe that person can make 'em well, well, then they're cured. They cured themselves... By believing, by telling their minds that they're better. You know, the real sick ones, the germ-sick and the cripples like that, they stay the same, no matter what. That's my theory. Very interesting. My old man's right about one thing though. What's that? You gotta give folks a little scripture with your healing. Makes it easier going down. You best dust off your Bible, darlin'. Well, I'll keep that in mind. Hey, I got an idea. Since I'm such an expert on the good book... Well, I could help you out. How? Well, we can work out at your place or mine. I got a little room right here in town, just down the street. You know, we could start tonight. What do you want, Cal? What can I get? The check, for one thing. Oh, yeah. Then you can get lost. Hey! Hey! You never got to see my stitches! Yeah. I know. MAN: Whoo! (LAUGHTER) EDNA: Before we get started, there's something I'd like to talk to you about. Last week, Earl Carpenter asked me in whose name I do this healing. And, uh, I've been thinking a lot about that. And I thought I'd just tell you what happens to me when I do it. There's this person standing in front of me, see? And they're sick or hurtin', scared. And, uh, somehow... And don't ask me how... (CHUCKLES) I... I just kind of become them. I... I start feeling hurt and scared and sick. (STUTTERING) It's like I feel them. But there's this other me that's outside, that wants to reach out and make the pain go away. You know, kind of the way a mother does when her little one gets hurt. It's a kind of "kiss and make it better" sort of thing. Now, I don't want any of you to think that I deny Jesus in any way, because I don't. So if you ask me how the power comes to me, I have to tell you, I don't know. I just know that it does. And I offer it to you in the name of love. MAN: (ON RADIO) This Wednesday... Shh! So bring all your little buckaroos to the Kansas championship rodeo. (KNOCKING) I'm not home. Well, in that case, I won't come in. (COUNTRY MUSIC ON RADIO) (BARKING) Hiya, mutt. His name's Clancy. Oh, excuse me, Clancy. Gee, this is comfy. This is real comfy. What do you want? No, wait, I asked you that already, didn't I? I don't suppose it's changed any, has it? (SIGHS) You know, it does surprise me, Edna Mae, after that little speech you gave today, how you can still think the worst of people. (SNIFFS) Mmm, that smells good. You know, it's a real coincidence, 'cause I plain forgot to eat today. (CUTLERY CLATTERING) Make yourself at home. Thanks. Hope you like beefaroni. I love beefaroni. It's my all-time favorite. (MUSIC CONTINUES ON RADIO) Mmm! This is delicious. I mean, you could probably open up a restaurant with this, I'm not kiddin'. MAN: * Do you see a trace of love on my face? * I notice you held on to mine * Look in my eyes Mmm, this is real comfy. You said that. You're a hell of a long ways from town, though. It must get lonely. I like it that way. Is that a fact? Hmm. You know, I can remember how god-awful quiet it used to get when I was livin' with the folks. Especially when you turn the radio off. Here, listen. (RADIO STOPS) Now, that's quiet. I can hear you breathin'. Is that a fact? Now, that was real good. (SIGHS) Well, I know it's impolite to eat and run, but I'll forgive you this time. (PLATES CLATTER) What are you doin', Edna Mae? Well, Cal, it looks like I'm askin' you to leave. Why? I think you know why. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Seems to me that's more of a reason for stayin'. No, I would really like you to leave. (CLICKS TONGUE) Okay. (CHUCKLES) Well, heck, you know, we can shake hands and be friends. (WHISPERS) Goodbye. Looks like an ordinary old hand to me. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Let me see the other one. You know, you've got a long lifeline right there. You know, you say you can feel the sickness and the hurt in folks. What else can you feel, Edna Mae? You don't want that. Clancy, scram. This is private. (ROOSTER CROWING) CAL: I'm with you, buddy. I feel the same way. I expect you to say something like that. It wasn't bad, was it? (CHUCKLES) Super Stud strikes again? I didn't mean it like that. I mean, it was remarkable, wasn't it? (BOTH LAUGHING) It's been a long time. Well, the drought's over, girl. Is it? Isn't it? (INAUDIBLE) EDNA: Kathy and I used to come here when we were kids and go skinny-dipping. Is that an invitation? Don't you think you wanna give it a rest? No, it's been hours and hours. I need some healin'. Oh, really? Yeah. I got this problem. Oh, yeah? How big a problem you got? I don't know, but I think you better lay your hands on it. Are you sure you can take it? I got faith in you, sister. Okay. You asked for it. I'm sorry, I can't help her. Not right now anyway. I'm sorry. Best you take her home now. Edna Mae, we have one more. All right, Doc. Couldn't you help her? (SIGHS) Oh, Grandma Pearl, some people need their sickness to get love and attention, and some people need it to give those things. It's not up to me to judge the right or wrong of it. Edna Mae, I have seen her X-rays. She has nearly complete degeneration of two lumbar vertebrae. Well, I haven't seen her pictures, Doc, so I'm a little ahead of you. EDNA: Is there much pain? WOMAN: All the time. (GROANING SOFTLY) (WHIMPERING) (GROANING) (GROANING CONTINUES) (SIGHS) Ah, that's better. Huh? Would you like to try and sit up? Oh, no, no, no. You can do it. No. Yes, you can. No, no. No. (SOFTLY) Come on. No... No, no. Just take my hands. Look in my eyes. Look at me. You can sit up now. You don't have to be afraid. (GASPING) That's not too much pain for us, is it? No. (GROANING) You can take that, can't you? That's it. Come on. Come on. (GRUNTS) That's it. You're up. (CHUCKLING) You're up. Okay. Here you are. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (LAUGHING) WOMAN: Okay. Would you like to stand now? Stand? Yes. You can do it. Come on. You can do it. Stand up? Stand up? That's right. Oh, I... You can stand. (STAMMERING) I... I think so. No... Stand? I think you can. (PANTING) Oh, no, wait. You can do it. Nice and easy. Be careful. Right there. (GROANING) Okay, give me your hands. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Give me your hand. Look at me. You can stand up now. (GROANS) You can. Come on. That's it. That's it. A few inches now. (GRUNTS) You're almost there. (GRUNTS) EDNA: You're doin' it. EDNA: You're standin'. Oh, good. Ooh! You got it. You're up. (GASPS) You're standin'. You're standin'. MAN: Lord, have mercy. (MURMURING) (LAUGHING) Oh, you're just wonderful. Thank you, dear. Bless you. Thank you. Carla. (SOBBING) Grandma! Hey. WOMAN: Isn't it wonderful? (CHUCKLING) EDNA: Would you like to take a few steps? You can walk, you know. (SIGHS) I can walk? Oh, dear. Take my hand, Carla. (GASPS) Oh! Oh, I can walk! (LAUGHS) (APPLAUSE) (LAUGHING) I can walk! I can walk! I can walk! I can walk! (APPLAUSE CONTINUES) That's enough for one day. Why don't you make a chair out of yourselves and carry her out? Isn't that wonderful? Isn't that wonderful, Carla? You can... You can come with Grandma for a walk in the woods now, huh? Oh. Ooh! What are we doin' here? (LAUGHING) Oh, my, just like a throne! Isn't that beautiful? Bye-bye. Bye-bye. You better take some new pictures, Doc. (APPLAUSE) PAUL: Mrs. McCauley? Yes? I'm Paul Hankins, and this is Joyce Baxter. We're from the California Institute of Psychology. Oh. How do you do? This is Cal Carpenter. Hi. Can we talk to you for a minute? How you doin'? Sure. We've been watching your healings, and we're convinced what you're doing is absolutely genuine. Well, that's a load off my mind. For us, that's saying a lot. Why is that? Well, we're scientists. We've seen a lot of people who claim to do what you do, but in our follow-up investigations, most of it falls apart. Your healings don't. The... The effects seem to sustain. There are people who can heal as you do, though. They seem to be able to harness and focus the same kind of power. What kind of power is that? We don't know. Bless you, honey. There are all kinds of theories. Cold electron emission, bioplasmic energy, etheric energy. Ooh, that sounds complicated. What does it matter as long as it works? But it doesn't always. You haven't been 100 % effective, have you? No, I miss about 30 % of the time. We've got some machines back at the institute that can measure and record this thing in different ways. We'd like you to come back and do some tests for us, at our expense, of course. Kind of like a guinea pig? Kind of. No, thanks. Why not? (SIGHS) Well, because what's going on here seems to have to do with people and feelings, not wires and machines. I don't know, it just doesn't feel right to me. Uh, I just wish you'd, uh... You'd think about it. It would mean a lot to us and to a lot of other people. Okay, I'll think about it, I really will. (CAR RATTLING) EDNA: Uh-uh. Like a Frankenstein movie. (CHUCKLES) Me all wired up like some kind of freak with a bunch of scientists runnin' around pokin' me and saying, "Oh, how extraordinary! How strange!" No, thank you. Not me. Is something the matter? I don't know. Every time I let you come with me to one of these things, you start... Yeah, just let it go, all right, Edna Mae? I don't feel like talkin' about it right now. Fine with me. I don't care. (CLATTERING) (INSECTS CHIRPING) Cal, won't you talk to me? Come on! How bad can it be? Huh? Please? It's just when I see the way the people come to you, you know, and what you do for them, it just don't... Fit into your theory? No, it don't. It ain't like them tent shows. You know, I watch you healin', makin' the pain go away, and the whole thing feels like it's somethin'... What? Holy. Honey, if there's anything holy here, it's just the simple holiness of love, that's all. Believe me, I'm not the Holy Ghost. And I'm not exactly the Virgin Mary either. You oughta know that better than anybody. Shut up! Don't you be talkin' like that! Hey, I will talk any way I damn well please! What's the matter with you? I don't understand you at all. Yeah, I guess you don't. Well, you know, you're not exactly much help. I'm sorry about that. It's just somethin' I can't... You can't what? I'm listening. What? I'll see you. Cal... See you later, Edna Mae. (DOOR SLAMS SHUT) (ENGINE STARTS) (ENGINE REVVING) (BANGING ON DOOR) Cal? Dad. You ain't nothin' but trash. Always been, always will be. Oh, we're back to that again, are we? You got a lot of folks fooled around here, but I see what's been goin' on here! I thought you might've changed. Not you, though. Now, you're bringin' your whorin' home, are you? You're the same old bitch in heat! Now, you listen! I want you gone! I don't care where... I just want you out of my sight! And I don't ever wanna see you again. Am I makin' myself clear enough for ya? You are. And the sooner, the better. I'll go... And I don't ever wanna see you again, either! You're a hard, stupid old man, without an ounce of love or understanding anywhere! And I am sick to death of... (SOBBING) ...trying to get you to love me. (SOBBING) "The Lord God said unto the woman, "'What is this that thou hast done? "And the woman said, 'The serpent beguiled me and I did eat.' "And the Lord God said unto the serpent, "'Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, "'above every beast in the field.'" (KNOCKING) Who is it? EDNA: It's me. Hi. I'm leaving for Los Angeles. Want to come? MAN: Just concentrate on the beam, Edna, and see if you can influence its direction in any way, any way at all. (MACHINE CLICKING) It's okay. Is it? Sure. It happens that way sometimes. Sometimes? How about every time now? I used to have this friend... (CHUCKLES) Who always used to say, "There's no such thing as a bad lay. "It's either good or better." I told you I don't like you talkin' like that. Why not? 'Cause it don't suit you. Well, what does? What do you want? Hallelujahs and amens? I wanna know what's happenin' to you. I'll tell you what's happening to me. Somebody I care about is going very weird on me. I can't even touch you anymore without you getting all cold and funny. Look what you've been doin'. You call that normal? Natural? Yes. Yes, I do. What do you call it? God, you're beginning to sound like your father. Well, if I do, it's 'cause you're scarin' the hell outta me with this stuff. But why? Why does it scare you? It's too much power. Can't you see that? There's somethin' else workin' here. What? What is it? Just say it. Spit it out. Tell me. What? It's for you to tell me, Edna Mae, and you know that. Now, I ain't got nothin' more to say about it until you do. Great. Terrific. Real nice talkin' to you. You keep in touch, ya hear? We have a unique experiment to conduct today. Our colleagues on the research staff, Doctors Joyce Baxter and Paul Hankins, have brought Mrs. Edna McCauley, a bona fide healer, here to the institute for testing. Today, she has agreed to attempt to deal on an experimental level with a human subject. A Miss Louise Kaufner, who's suffering from dystonia musculorum deformans, has volunteered to participate. Now, with this disease, stereotaxic cryosurgery has produced some relief in some cases. But, although Louise has had the surgery, no relief has been evident. Mrs. McCauley, would you like to say anything? No, thank you. Uh, Mrs. McCauley will begin. Louise, I don't know if I can help you, but I'm gonna try, all right? It's all right if you can't. I've never known anything else. (CHUCKLES) I'm just gonna lift your head. All right. Okay. Okay, you'll just feel my hands getting a little warm. That's part of it. They won't burn you or anything. Let me get up there with you. I'm gonna move you. Don't help me. Let me do it all, okay? All right. (GRUNTS) (MUFFLED GRUNTING) I'm sorry. All right. Just give me your head. Lean on me. That's it. Give me all your weight. Okay. Now try and relax. Try and relax. That's better. Okay. All right. (LOUISE SOBBING) (EDNA SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) Oh! (GASPS) (WHIMPERING) (BOTH WHIMPER) (EDNA GASPS) (LOUISE GROANING) Oh! (GROANING CONTINUES) Has anything like this happened before? BOTH: No. (GROANING LOUDLY) (LOUD GROAN) Look! Look! (CROWD MURMURING) (GROANS IN AGONY) Get away from her! Just stay away! (SOBBING) Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, God, what did you... (SOBBING) Oh, God, what did you do? Oh! (WAILING) CAL: You've been out for two days. How you feelin'? How's Louise? She's well, Edna Mae. They don't know how, but she is. (SOFTLY) That's wonderful. There's some reporters outside who want to talk to you. My father's dying. They called yesterday about your father. How could you know that? Would you get the nurse for me, please, Cal? Come on. I wanna see him before he goes. EDNA: I wanted that baby, Daddy. I didn't feel any shame for not being married. God help me, I let you bring that old horse doctor in here to kill that little girl. And scrape me out so that nothing would ever grow inside me again. What happened that made you so hard? What hurt you? What made you stop loving? Daddy, you drove us all away from you. All of us. Mama into her silence, where she stayed until she died of grief. Sam to Vietnam, where they killed him. (SOBBING) Daddy, listen. I want you to know that I still love you, and I can help you now. Honest, I can. I know that you know you're dying. And I know that you're afraid, but you don't have to be. See, when I had that accident, I died... I mean, just for a few minutes. But I saw it, and it's beautiful! It is. Everyone's there. Mama and Sam and Joe... And Mr. Condon, the grocer and Mr. Stratton... Do you remember him? And, Daddy, there's music. Bells and chimes. And you... You begin to feel like... Like you understand everything. And you don't feel your body anymore. And there's this light, and it's so bright and loving. And you can feel it reaching out for you. And everybody that's there... Mama and Joe and Sam... Everybody is helping you to it. And then pretty soon, you begin to understand... (HARMONICA PLAYING) That you're made of the same light. EDNA: Grandma Pearl is here, and Uncle Ely, and Aunt Carrie and everybody. And I've been telling them about it. And they wanna come and say goodbye to you. (CONTINUES PLAYING HARMONICA) Oh, Edna. What is it, Daddy? Tell me. Light, Edna. Light! Yes, Daddy. Oh! Oh, my... (GASPING) "And there appeared a great wonder. "A woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet, "and upon her head a crown of 12 stars." "In that hour, he had cured many diseases and plagues. "And he answered, the blind received their sight, "the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear." You can't deny him any longer, Edna Mae. You got to declare his comin' now. You have his power. I've seen it. You are his power. "And the woman was bent and could not straighten, "and he laid his hands on her, "and immediately she was made straight." Now, the Christ is makin' hisself known to us through you. How many proofs more do you need? You heal, you die, and you live again. You have the power of prophecy. You knew your Pa was dyin'. You knew that. Cal, stop it. Look, Edna, I denied him and I almost died, and he saved me through you. Now, the power is here. It's you. Say it, Edna Mae! He is makin' hisself known. You say it! I want you to get out of here right now, Cal. You are the living Christ. No. You are the resurrection, the fulfillment of his promise to us. I'm not the living Christ. Believe me. I'm not. Cal? (LOADS SHOTGUN) "If thy law had not been my delight, "I would have perished in my affliction. "I will never forget thy precepts, "for by them... Thou hast given me life." (CHUCKLES) "I am thine. "The wicked deny you, "but I consider thy testimonies. "I will make clear the way of your coming." EDNA: So he went to the doctor and he said, "Doc, my right foot hurts." And the doctor said, "Heck, Zeke, that's just old age." And he said, "Oh, yeah? Well, my left foot's just as old. "How come that doesn't hurt?" (LAUGHTER) Then there was the inscription on the tombstone of the hypochondriac that said, "See? Now will you believe I'm sick?" (LAUGHTER) (YELLING) He shall be revealed! My God, he's got a gun! (ALL SCREAMING) (CLATTERING) (GUNSHOT) (VOICES OVERLAPPING) It's all right. I'm all right. (MUTTERING) Oh, don't hurt him! (LOUD CLAMORING) Please! He didn't mean it! He didn't know what he was doing! Don't hurt him, please. Oh, God! (SIGHS) (GRUNTING) That's the last of it. KATHY: I wish you'd change your mind. EDNA: (CHUCKLES) No. PEARL: Seems like you're always leaving. EDNA: It does, doesn't it? Can't you tell us where you're goin'? Well, I don't know. I just wanna drive around and see what I can see. And I'll call you when I light somewhere. Bye, Jack. Thanks. Buck, thanks for everything. None needed. Goodbye, cousin. Bye, Kathy. You take care, you hear? You, too. You all go on. I want my goodbye private. Well, seems like you had your own cavalry here, child. Seems like. They let you see him? He didn't want to see me. I tried to see him, but he didn't want to. Well, I expect he has some time to think about all this for a while. Yeah. You know, when I was in high school, I... I read about Joan of Arc. Remember her? (CHUCKLES) I was just thinking how crazy everything is. That she was burned for hearing voices, and I was almost got for not. (CHUCKLES) Can't win for losin', huh? You ain't lost nothin'. God bless you, child. (CHUCKLES) What? What is it? Well, I... I just got this here feelin', this'll be the last time we... We saw each other. In this world, anyways. (SNIFFLES) Well, you save me a good place on the other side. I'll save it. (LAUGHS) I love you, Grandma. Yes, that's it, ain't it? If we could just love each other as much as we say we love Him, I suspect there wouldn't be the bother in the world there is. I suspect. (LAUGHING) PEARL: You write, you hear? I promise. Drive careful. I will. (ENGINE STARTS) (KISSING) (CLANCY BARKS) Okay, Clancy, come on. Come on. That's a boy. WOMAN: Oh, my, is your granddaddy gonna be glad to see you. Let's see. The last time you saw him, you were four. And after we see the Grand Canyon, we'll go over to the Navajo reservation and see the Indians. Real Indians, Bobby. They do war dances and everything. Won't that be fun? MAN: And you know what, Bobby? Right near there, we can see dinosaur tracks from millions of years ago! Won't that be great? Uh-huh. What a funny place. MAN: Hello? (HENS CLUCKING) Hello? Anybody home? Yeah, yeah, I'm here. Can't get that darn wheel off. I used to have a gear puller, but I broke it about six... Was it six? No, it was seven years ago. You know, they don't make things like they used to, you know what I mean? They sure don't. Um, I'm gonna need some gas. Do you want me to fill it up? No, I'll fill it up. Hello. How are you? Hi. Hi, there. What's your name? Bobby... Ma, could I have a cold drink? EDNA: There's some drinks right there. Help yourself. (CATTLE MOOING) Looks like a pretty sick little boy. He is. Uh... It's cancer. Hello, little puppy. His liver and... Uh, nothing we can... We thought we'd take him on a trip, you know. Let him see some things. He's got relatives in Utah he's never even seen. Lake Powell is nice. They have some boat rides there that just go for miles. MAN: That sounds great. What's his name? Who, him? That's Clancy III. Hey, you folks aren't in a hurry, are you? No, not really. Do you like plants? I mean, like, desert plants? Yeah. Guess so. Well, I have a rock garden over there with the most fantastic assortment of desert plants you ever saw in your life. Why don't you go take a look at it while Bobby and I chew the fat here? Yeah, I guess we could. Thanks. It's free. It's really beautiful. I think he likes you. Really? Yeah. Well, he doesn't snuggle up to everybody that way. Oh, look. He's kissing you. Have you ever seen a two-headed snake? No? Would you like to? EDNA: I was here a long time ago when she was alive. The man who owned her called her Gemini. (CHICKEN CLUCKING) He charged me 10 cents to see her, too. (CLANCY III BARKING) I was gonna charge you, but figured it wasn't fair, her bein' dead and all. Gemini. So Engine Joe woke up, and he saw the scalps hanging from the lodge pole. And he heard this terrible screaming, and he saw the faces of the dead men coming toward him. Well, he got outta there and ran away, and we've never heard from him since around here. But you know what? Some folks say that on some nights up in Black Mesa, you can hear that screaming, and see the faces of the dead men floating around without any bodies. Boy, I wouldn't go up there for a million bucks. Me neither. Uh-uh. I wouldn't. (GROANS) It hurt? Sometimes. They give me pills for it. I guess I'm dying. I hear them talking about it. Sometimes they don't know I hear 'em. I just wish it wouldn't make them so sad. Hey, would you like to keep him? Sure, but... What? I don't think I'll be around to take care of him. Ah, I wouldn't worry about that. Not one bit. Beautiful! Absolutely wonderful! They really are. But how come they're blooming in September? Ain't that the darnedest thing you ever saw? Yeah. She said I could have him. Could I? Could I? Oh, son, I'm afraid... Listen, I think that boy and dog are just about stuck together now. He won't be any trouble. Please? Please? (MURMURING) Why, sure. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Could I pay you for him? Oh, no. But you can pay me for the gas. Oh, gosh. I'm sorry, I forgot. That's all right. There. Good. Thank you. Thank you. However, you can pay me for that dog. I'd say the price of that dog is, uh... One big hug, what do you say? (CHUCKLES) (GROANS) (EDNA GASPS) Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
