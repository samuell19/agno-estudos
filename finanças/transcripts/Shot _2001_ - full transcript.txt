[MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR ENGINE SPUTTERING] Fuck. Fuck. Come on. [CAR ENGINE SPUTTERING] [SIGHS] Get in. Wait. Let me explain, you guys. Get your motherfucking ass in the car. Get the fuck in the car! [GUNSHOT] Half of that shit, bitch-ass. Hi, Sidney. Just calling to say hi. Uh, I know I've put my foot in my mouth in the past by saying one thing and then not following me through with it. And I just felt that if I didn't pick up the phone right now and call you and be spontaneous like you always say, and tell you that I'm going to start building my portfolio again for real, then another year might go by. I'll see you tonight. I-- Robert. I love you. We've got customers. Use your lunch break to make calls. You know better. Marcus, go tell your brother and sister dinner's ready. Dinner's ready. [PRETENDING TO TOOT A HORN] That means you, ugly. I'm not ugly. Mom, Marcus called me ugly again. 'Cause you're ugly. [PRETENDING TO TOOT A HORN] What's wrong with you, boy? Oh, you think you're slick. Oh, that's what it is. [GIGGLING] Keith's in a bad mood. Shut up, Marcus. Keith's got girlfriend. Marcus, shut up. Keith, don't yell at your brother. Sorry, Mom, but he's always babbling through that stupid tube of his. Just come and sit down for dinner. You haven't been hanging out with those hoodlums, have you? No, Mom. And they're not hoodlums. They're my friends. It's not like I go out anyway. I'm always watching them. I need you to watch your brother and sister, so I can work. And we can live. Plus, it keeps you off the streets and away from those hoodlums you call friends, Shaggy and Scooby, whatever their names are. Mom, it's Shade Dog. And I told you they're not hoodlums. They're my friends. Mom, we already talked about this. I need to go out for a minute. I'm not hungry. Can I go? Go. And don't be out late. Eisha, Say a prayer. God, thank you for this great food and for not making me ugly. [KISSING] Keith, I really need to talk to you about something. Oh, babe, can't it wait? This feels so good. No, Keith, please. Keith. Keith. Keith! OK. Let's talk. Keith, I'm pregnant. You're pregnant? Yeah. Man, so much for those jimmies. Guess I'm about to be a motherfucking father, daddy and shit. [CRIES] No, baby, no. Don't cry. It's OK. It's OK. Don't cry, OK? [CRIES] I'm-- I'm sorry. It's OK, baby. I love you. I wish it-- [SOBBING] I wish it-- It's OK. It's OK. I love you, Keith. I love you too, baby. I'm sorry. No, baby, it's OK. It's not yours. Please hold me. [INAUDIBLE] Please, Keith, don't. Get the fuck off me. It's not mine. Who you pregnant by, Elisa? I'm sorry. --happened just one time. Who the fuck was it? It'll screw too many things up if I tell you. --behind my motherfucking back. I ain't leaving you here till you tell me who it was. Albert. His name is Albert. Keith, please. Please stay with me. Get the fuck off me. ELISA: Keith, please! Hey, what's up? MOM: Keith, is that you? KEITH: Yeah, Mom, it's me. Oh, baby, I was so worried about you. You don't have to worry about me, Mom. How long you been on the floor? A couple hours. They were shooting again. And they were close too. Momma, you're safe now. You need to be in your bed. How do you expect your back to get better on the floor? MOM: Oh, baby, I was so worried about you when I heard those shots earlier. Momma, I told you don't worry about me. I have to worry about Keith. You're my son. Every time you leave this house to go hang out with those hoodlum friends of yours, I worry. Every time I hear gunfire and sirens, I worry. Every time you say to me, "Mom, you don't have to worry," I worry. MARCUS: Keith's in trouble. Shut up, punk. Marcus, go to bed. Keith, understand I just don't want to see you get hurt. Now, I need you to stay here tomorrow and watch your brother and sister. No, Mom. I know it's hard, baby. But I need your help. OK? OK, Momma. Come here. [CRIES] It's OK, Momma. [CLANGING] Shit. Mm. Robert? Hey. What time is it? Go back to sleep. I'll wake you up in an hour. Mm. Are you still coming to my shoot? Huh? My shoot. Are you still coming? Yeah, of course. Go to sleep. Hm. Hm. Does it still work? Yup. I mean, the batteries are dead, and the film's all expired, but it's just how I left it. Do you want to, um, stop at a store on the way? Yeah. Yeah, that'd be good. DIRECTOR: All right, let's do this! How you feeling, baby? Yo, man, is this rope gonna hold? Because if I fall, I can't be doing no video from the wheelchair and shit. DIRECTOR: Want another rope? Give me another rope, man. DIRECTOR: Somebody get him another rope. Hey, look, man. I'm not feeling this. The camera move is all wrong. When he turns to-- what's her name? DIRECTOR 2: I don't know who she is. DIRECTOR: Well, then just hold the goddamn frame, all right? Not everything got to be so damn jerky. Smooth it out. All right? Playback. Let's do it! Let's play this back. Let's go! What the fuck we waiting on? I'm scratching my nuts over here. Play it back! Kid, can I take-- Hey, it's OK. I just want to take your picture. Can I take your picture? But put those tubes up to your eyes like you had them before. Can I look through your camera? Yeah, sure. Can I-- can I just take this picture first? I'll tell you what-- why don't you down on one knee? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Good, good, good, good. Now look right into the lens right here. [CAMERA CLICKING] OK, let's do another one-- something different, though. Uh-- - Can I look? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Be careful, though, OK? Whoa. MARCUS: You like that, huh? Now, that's not a movie camera. I know. Here, watch this. Look at across the street. See that? Wow. How did you do that? Well, I just turned this ring. You see, this is the focus, like this. And that's the zoom, like that. You have to let me take a picture. Absolutely. Come on. Uh, where are we going? You'll see. OK. This is my house. We're going to take a picture at your house? No. That's just where I live. What's your name? Uh, Robert. What's your name? Marcus. Hey, hey, hey, Marcus, hold on a second. [RAP MUSIC PLAYING] MARCUS: It's OK. Just keep walking. Now if you focus on the fence there and-- What's the circle in the middle? That helps with the focusing. Oh, I see. Now if you're ready and you feel it, take it. [CLICK] Thank you. You're welcome, kid. MOMMA: Marcus? Marcus, time to come in. Coming, Mom. You know, this could be a great opportunity for you. I just need to clear my boss, but I'm sure that it won't be a problem. All right, well if it is, you've got to let me know ASAP. Oh, don't worry. I'm in. I'm 98%. Cool. I'll call you later to confirm. I'm-- I'm going to ask him for the time off. And if he says no, well then I've just got to tell him that he's left me no choice and that I have to quit. So you think this is going to lead to other work? Oh yeah. I mean, if it doesn't, then I'll just go out there, and I'll getting Joe job until something does. I was finally in the right place at the right time. I'm happy. I can see that. I can really see that. I just-- I've seen you here before. I'm going to do it. Yeah? All right. Well, if you feel it here, then I say go for it. I mean, I haven't seen you this happy about something in a long time. - I'm going to do this. [GIGGLES] Just be confident. Like this? Yeah, I'll buy that. The answer is no. I've got a heap of equipment coming back early next week and a quick turnaround. I'm running a business here. OK, well then, I'm-- then I'm just going to-- Be patient. I'm getting ready to start making some changes around here. I'm hoping to take some time off myself. I'm going to need someone to run this place. I'm thinking you are the man for the job. I'm talking a pay increase as well. That sounds good, Earl, but-- To tell you the truth, most of the guys who come through here move on to be assistants and even sometimes make the jump to working photographers, but it is rare to have someone as knowledgeable about the equipment and photography stick around for as long as you have. I'm thinking I'm going to give you a step up in rank too. You deserve it. We'll figure all that stuff out in a couple of weeks. [PHONE RINGING] Earl Rents. Well, let me connect you to Robert, our rental manager. Take it out front. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] [MOANING] BOO'S VOICEMAIL: Yo, it's Boo. Get back at me, all right?

Get in the fucking car. SHADE DOG: Get your ass in the car. BOO: Bitch. Fuck you. [PHONE RINGING] This is-- this is Robert. Oh, hey, Eldon. Yeah, I was going to call you. Yeah, sorry I didn't call you yesterday. I-- look, I have a question. Is there any chance that we could do the shoot over the weekend? Yeah, I didn't think so. I guess I can't do it then. You know, I thought I was going to be able to and-- yeah, well I-- I mean-- yeah, thanks for thinking-- yeah, sure. Hold on a second. Go ahead. Three strobe kits, 15 C stands. You know what? Why don't you just fax the list over. It will probably be easier. [CAR SPUTTERING] I don't know why I didn't think of you as a rental manager sooner. Do you mind only taking 45 minutes since it's a late lunch? Yeah, I'll try, as long as the clock starts after I get my car started. [CAR SPUTTERING] [ENGINE STARTING] I mean, maybe I could call and still get the job back. No, come on. You made a decision. Things happen for a reason. Stick with your decision. Sydney, I felt it, and I didn't even do anything. I mean, I could have been somewhere by now. No, baby, you are somewhere. You just need to move forward from here. Robert, don't take this the wrong way, OK? But as long as I've known you, all you've talked about is being a photographer someday. But I don't remember ever seeing you take any pictures. Sydney, I work full time. SYDNEY: No. Bullshit, Robert. If you wanted to be a photographer, you would be a photographer. You wouldn't have time to do anything else. I mean, I don't understand. What are you so afraid of? I'm not. I-- I-- I just don't feel it, OK? SYDNEY: Then, move on. You don't get it. Apparently not. But explain one thing to me because I'm confused, OK? I really am. Why do you constantly beat yourself up over not doing something that you no longer feel like doing anymore? Look, I know that you're trying to help, OK, Syd? There is no way that you would get this No, I think that you are the one who doesn't get it, OK? Look, you blamed yourself for your best friend dying, right? I mean, that's why you don't take pictures anymore. I bought that for a year, maybe two. But the truth is even you stopped using that as an excuse. You gave up on your dream. Robert, you want to be a photographer? Go be a photographer. God, I just need to focus. Yeah. You need to pick one thing and do it really well. It's OK. MOMMA: Who's there? Hi. My name is Robert McKay. I met your son Marcus the other day. Would he happen to be home right now? What do you want with my baby? Well, actually, Marcus and I we were hanging out the other day, and we were taking pictures. I mean, your son completely amazed me. I'm sorry. Um, can I start over? Robert, what are doing here? I brought you your picture. Wow, it turned out? Yeah, it's a masterpiece. You should sign it. When did you-- This is so cool. Momma, I took this. It's very nice. Hold on. I'll be right back. We met the other day. Your son's got quite an eye. Well, it was very nice of you to bring by a copy. Take a look. Wow. You drew these? Yeah. Can we take some more? Yeah, sure. I don't-- I mean, it's up to your mother, really. I-- I don't know you. I understand that. I got to go to work anyway. MOMMA: Where do you work? I work at a camera shop, Earl Rent. Please, Mom. Robert's a photographer. I want to be one. I thought you wanted to be a fireman. I do. I want to be both. I have to cook dinner. Please. You know, if it would make you more comfortable, we could just shoot some pictures here on your property. Please don't say no. How about another time? Momma, this isn't fair. Marcus, listen to your mom. She knows what she's talking about. But I want to take some more pictures. Can you come back tomorrow around 3:00? I need to talk to Marcus and think about it. Actually, I gotta work tomorrow. Oh, man. Will you come back? Yeah, sure, I'll come back. I'll come back sometime. Promise? I promise. Looks good, man. Let me see it. He didn't take this. Yes, I did. I don't like it. - Nisha. - Shut up. Marcus. She started it. Marcus, say a prayer. God, let Robert come over tomorrow with his nice camera and tell mom to let me take pictures with him. Amen. And thank you for this great food and making my mom a wonderful cook. [LAUGHS] MAN: Some bad shit. You know what I'm saying, homie? [CHATTER] Yeah. Hey, dog, fuck that shit, nigga. You know what I'm saying? Keith wanted to talk to the motherfucking boy. I shot his ass, nigga. Shit. JUNE BUG: Dog, he was fucking with Keith hard too, nigga. Hey, you got the wrong motherfucking guy and shit, nigga. It wasn't me. It wasn't me. MAN: [INAUDIBLE] this nigga, though, you know what I'm saying? It didn't have to go down like that. Talk to the motherfucker, that's all. Hey, man, [INAUDIBLE] you ain't sweat that shit, though, all right? I'm your nigga, man. Ain't nobody gonna leave your ass fucking hanging and shit, nigga. Come on. Come on, now. Hey, motherfucker. [GUNSHOTS] Fuck y'all! Fuck you, nigga! [GUNSHOTS] Anybody hit? [INTERPOSING VOICES] Man, [INAUDIBLE] bitch ass fucking gang, nigga. [INAUDIBLE] Motherfucker gonna pay for that shit. [INAUDIBLE], man. [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE] pay for that shit. [CLICK] ROBERT: Now, the key is to find something that interests you and focus on it. Now, I like to take pictures that tell stories. But you know, you-- I mean, you might like to take pictures that have no meaning at all. I want to take pictures of people. Well, that's a great thing to photograph. I want to take your picture. Mine? Why me? Because I want to always remember you. That's a good enough answer for me. I want you to smile. [CLICK] [CLICK] That's my brother, Keith. ROBERT: Hey. I got you something. That has 36 pictures on it. And that should be plenty if you think about each shot before you take it. I like being friends with you. I like being friends with you too. Now, that's color film, but I'm going to develop it in black and white. I'll make you a deal. I'll take care of all the developing and the printing, and I'll even replace the camera for you. But you have got to promise me something. What? I want you to think about each picture before you take it. Deal. Mm. [GRUNTS] You boys have fun? Took a lot of cool pictures. That's great. Go on in and wash your hands, so we can have dinner. Keith, dinner's ready. In a minute. Would you like to stay for dinner? Oh, no thank you. I gotta get going. Stay. My mom's an excellent cook. I'll bet she is, but maybe some other time. That's a good enough answer for me. See you later. Thanks. You're welcome. I'm not sure why you're doing this, but Marcus seems to be very happy. He's a good kid. Thank you. SYDNEY: I just don't understand. You haven't taken pictures in years, and now you pick the hood to be your canvas? I like taking pictures with him. Why wouldn't I go back? I mean, when we're together, it's-- I-- I can't explain it. I like the feeling that I get when I'm teaching him photography. I haven't been this passionate about something in a long time. I know. That's good. So take my picture. Or, you know, go out and take some fashion photography. Get some models to work for free. I mean, either way, use the fire, but use it for something that can actually lead to some work. Sydney, he is the fire. Well, you know what? I don't know if I want to stick around and watch you get all tangled up in something that you don't know anything about. I can't believing what you're saying right now. Look, I'm just saying it's dangerous out there, OK? I mean, I understand that you don't want to take pictures of fashion, and you want to take pictures of people. Fine. There's lots of interesting places out there that you can go to take pictures to build your portfolio, you know? Go to a mall. Go to-- go to a laundromat. Go to Paris. I'm not interested in Paris. and I'm not interested in people at the mall. Oh come on, Robert, you know what I mean. Look, I finally found something that grabs my interest. And believe me, this too is a real opportunity. Why can't you see that? I'm following my heart. I like teaching Marcus photography. He inspires me. [KNOCKING] Is Marcus here? No. Do you know what time he'll be home? Nope. Hey, why you so interested in my brother? I like the way he sees things. You don't know what time he'll be home? Nah. Hi. MOMMA: How you doing? OK. How are you? MOMMA: I am good. MARCUS: How you doing? - Hey. What's going on? Which one did you do? I brought you your parking meter. I was hoping you would do that one. Marcus? Here, I'll take the heavy one. Come on, we've got company. Make room. Would you like something to drink? Lemonade? ROBERT: Yeah, sure. Hold on, Robert. I'll be right back. [BELL JINGLES] ROBERT: Ah. Can't wait to see these. Now I only had time to print a few. This has all the pictures. That's called a contact sheet. MOMMA: Here you are. Oh, thank you. Mhm. I want some. You know where it is. Oh, that's a contact sheet, and that's a camera. No shit. These are so cool. Why are they all in black and white? Film stock, just my personal choice. Can we do color sometime? Ah, sure. Although, I can't print color at my house. You do this at your house? ROBERT: Sure do. Oh, why, yes. Yes, I do. How? ROBERT: That's another lesson. MOMMA: You didn't take any of these? No, they're Marcus's. We talked about the shots before, but they're Marcus's eye. I guess someone in our family is talented. Let me see that. Yeah, pretty good. Hopefully you can learn on your own, so you could do it by yourself. I like this one. Just tell me how much it was. I told you-- a lot. How much? Well, Sydney, let's just say it was an investment in my future. You already have a camera. Yeah, I do. [CLICK] But this one's better. [CAMERA CLICKING] Come on. I'm worried about you. Don't be. I'm fine. OK? Fine. [CAMERA CLICKING] What are you-- [SIGHS] [SIGHS] See, flash photography can be tricky because of the shadows. And then sometimes you get too much reflected light. You know what we need? We need a good subject to photograph. How about this glove? No. What? What's wrong? Nothing. It's just I-- I have this fri-- I had this friend that used to take pictures with me. What happened to him? He died in college. We were out late taking pictures together, and we got separated. And anyway, we used to play with those growing up. Sorry about your friend. Yeah, me too. Me too. Yeah. This one is my favorite. Hm. Yeah. Yeah, that's good. We could do that one. That'll work. MARCUS: Now turn a little bit to the left. ROBERT: OK. MARCUS: Keep coming. Keep coming. That's good. Make the two cars parallel, OK? Like in one of those car commercials. [CLICK] ROBERT: OK, I'll just move it a little bit to the left. How's that? MARCUS: That's good, that's good right there. [CLICK] Man, I can't believe how much [INAUDIBLE] Shade Dog, Boo-- shit, even you have changed in the last six months. What the fuck you expect? You can't [INAUDIBLE] forever. No, man, I expect you to use your head. I did. I cover for you. Shit. Fucking G-ride started tripping like a motherfucker when your ass stopped coming around. Yeah. That's because Mom's kept me in the house, man. Shit. Nah, but just between me and you ever since this whole G-ride, Anissa thing fell through, I don't know, man. I didn't think I would have to come back, but now I see I do out of loyalty. I didn't want Boo to shoot him, man. Boo just a live wire, man. Yo, he did it out of respect for you. Shit. Wouldn't do that shit for me. They don't respect me like they respect you. That's because you're always saying stupid shit, man. It pisses them off. Dang. They be shooting each other in there? How long is he going to teach your brother photography? I don't know, man. What's up? Not much. Just going to go take some more pictures of Marcus. Man, that seems to be the only thing he talks about these days. No, but what I'm trying to figure out is, how long is your little project in the hood going to last? What? Oh, you know, your black experiment. How long is it going to last, you know, until you leave? This isn't an experiment. I'm just teaching Marcus photography. As far as how long is it going to last, I don't know, Keith. I'm just taking it one day at a time. Look, look. Why are you doing this, huh, teaching my brother photography? I mean, he's the only black person you know. It's not about that. What's it about then? It's hard to explain. No, it's not. You're using my brother. And how's that? To--to be a part of something that you're not. I'm not using your brother to be a part of anything. Look, Keith, in case you haven't noticed, Marcus has an incredible gift. All I'm doing is teaching him how to use it. Or maybe what you haven't realized is that you're using my brother as a free pass to the hood. What I don't like is that you're-- you're messing with his mind. Look, I could see why you would think that. But I gotta tell you, Keith, I don't see it that way. Look, here it is straight, all right? You're starting something that you can't finish. I mean, my brother actually believes in you. He actually thinks you guys are friends. But what he doesn't realize is none of this is real. What's not real? Marcus and I are friends. KEITH: Nah, what I'm saying is when you bail-- you know, when you pack up your shit, and you leave. You're going to hurt my brother. And that's what's real. - Trust me, Keith. I'm not going to let that happen. Look, friends or no friends, the first time you catch a glimpse of something real down here, I mean really real, aw, man, you're going to want to be as far as possible away from here. Shit, even would Look, I didn't come down here to take those kinds of pictures, though. You expect me to believe that you come down to the hood to take pictures of mailboxes and-- and parking meters? Shit. Yeah, who would think, right? Well, you need to open your eyes, because there's way more than that going on down here. Shit, one day out with me and my homies. Oh and you'd be getting awards and shit. But I bet you one thing-- you wouldn't be back to take pictures with my brother, because you'd be too scared. I doubt that. Let me tell you something, Keith. Bad shit or real-- whatever you call it-- happens everywhere. Nah, not like this it don't. You know, in fact, I think it would be interesting to hang out with you and your friends for a day. You wouldn't be saying that if you came down here on the wrong day. I'm serious. I'd like to go with you. Nah, nah, see? You're using my brother. Forget it. Hey, hey, you brought it up, Keith. Now, if you don't want to show me what you-- what you say is real, well then I guess it's back to mailboxes and parking meters. See you later. Look, Robert. Yeah? Look, we both know it's going to hurt my brother if-- when you leave. Look, I'd rather it be sooner than later. Look, Keith, I told you. I'm not-- Just come by tomorrow around 1:00. Bring your camera. ROBERT: Where are we going? I don't know. Out? Tell me one thing, though. Is it going to be safe? I don't know-- probably not. But I'll look after you like you said you'll look after my brother. Look, I give you my word, all right? And I'll give you my word. I'm not going to hurt your brother. [KNOCKING] Motherfucker ain't rolling with us. What the fuck you thinking about? No, G-man, come on, man. You got it all wrong. He just wants to take pictures of things we see. That's all. Hey, nigga, what the fuck you tell that white boy about us? Nothing man, nothing. What the fuck you want him to roll with us for, then? Look, it's like this, all right he's teaching my brother photography, but I think it's bullshit. I think he's using my brother for his all selfish reasons. I just want to scare him up out the hood, that's all. - Scare him out the hood? - Yeah. That motherfucker ain't gotta roll with us to get his ass up out the hood. I could probably mob over there and make that motherfucker leave the hood right now. Nah, look, look, look. Come on, man. It can't go down like that. Look, trust me on this one, all right? It's a bad idea, Low, rolling through the hood with a white boy with a motherfucking camera? Hell no. I see your point, all right? What the fuck is he thinking? Hey, it would be kind of dope to have pictures of Juju and his little bitch ass crew just seconds before we smoked the motherfuckers, wouldn't it? Yeah. I wanna 8x10 of that shit. Give me a little wallet size. Sorry, man, the fellas don't think it's cool. How come? I don't know. It's complicated. They don't know you. What, you can't just walk over and introduce me? Trust me, Keith, I'm not going to make you look like a fool. Believe me, you can't make me look like a fool. I didn't mean it that way. Yeah, I know what you meant. I don't know. It's just once G-ride gets his mind set on something, it doesn't change. Keith. KEITH: What's up? G-Ride says it's cool. He can roll with us. [COUGHS] So the homey K-Low tells me you a professional photographer. Is that right? Yeah, sorta. BOO: What, you chase around famous people and shit? No, I'm just getting back into it. BOO: That's cool. Yeah, you know, it's actually all right. I mean, it's a bunch of mailboxes and parking meters, but. Now what you need to be taking pictures of are naked women. Now that's photography, huh? Yeah, you know any? Where the fuck you from? Hollywood area. Let's get something straight here, Wood. You can roll with us, but under one condition. Uh-huh. You don't take no flicks of my crew and no flicks that's gonna get your ass killed. Do you understand? Yeah, not a problem, guys. Well, let's roll then. Dumb motherfucker. KEITH: Get some pictures. ROBERT: Yeah, a few. It's hard taking pictures from the car. MAN: Yeah, try shooting a fucking gun [INAUDIBLE].. ROBERT: Are you serious? MAN: No, we are just fucking with you. MAN: Yo, yo, all you gotta do is see with your eyes what you want to take a picture of it, and then you take it. MAN: What the fuck are you talking about? ROBERT: Well, that works for some shots, but I want to compose each shot, you know, look through the lens. MAN: What the fuck you know about photography? [INAUDIBLE] nada. KEITH: Yo, we gotta get this guy some good pictures, you, you know, of something real. Ain't that right, Robin. Hey, I know where the fuck we going. SHADE DOG: Oh, take a picture of that chick ahead with the big ass. G-RIDE: He don't want a picture of that shit. Shut the fuck up, man. SHADE DOG: Yo, let's take him to crack alley, man, take some pictures of some crackheads. That's real. JUNE BUG: Yeah, that's some real life-- that's some real life [INAUDIBLE]. MAN: [INAUDIBLE] there, man. They said it's like eternal fire. Hey. Check this shit out. [CLICK] G-RIDE: [INAUDIBLE] - Take it. - Take it! Hurry up. Take the motherfucking picture now. [INTERPOSING VOICES] - Let's just go. Let's just go. Come on. [TIRES SQUEALING] Why the fuck you didn't take the picture? ROBERT: I didn't want to piss him off. Piss him off? Man, that was a Kodak moment. SHADE DOG: Man, don't be worried about pissing nobody off. You with us. Man, ain't nobody gonna hurt you. If we don't want you to take a flick, we'll tell your bitch-ass. Otherwise, take the motherfucking flick. ROBERT: So then I can just assume I can take whatever I want. Hello, no, motherfucker. Sit your ass back there hush. Look, all I'm saying is I hope you're not planning on going back there. Well of course I am. Keith invited me. You're playing with fire. They don't want to hurt me, Syd. You don't know that. Would you just listen to me for a moment? I'm listening. I'll admit-- I'll admit it was a rush being a fish in somebody else's fish bowl. OK, first of all, you're not a fish, OK? And second of all, if you are, it's not a fish bowl. It's a tank full of sharks. Well, I meant to say. We're all sharks. I'll admit it. I get a rush from taking pictures of a world I know nothing about. I see its beauty and its violence and its struggle. And I document it. Except them. You can't take pictures of them. I'm not hanging out with wanted murderers. Keith is a very, very smart young man. I mean, I like taking pictures of things I don't normally see, you know because I don't live there. Why can't you understand that? It's not that I don't understand it. It's just that I think that there is a reason that these people don't want their pictures taken. And I don't think it's because they're camera shy. I just-- I just feel like eventually one of these sharks is going to turn around and bite you on the ass. [LAUGHTER] Shut up. Look, I know that you worry about me, but you shouldn't. I'm finally taking pictures again. I know. I know. I just-- I just don't understand why you can't do it from the beach, you know? Why do you have to do so much swimming? Oh. Oh my God, you're so fucking cute right now I can't believe it. Come here. [KISS] [GRUNTING] [CAMERA CLICKING] MAN: Ah, fuck you. MAN: Oh shit. MAN: Arms out, baby. Yeah! Oh. [CAMERA CLICKING] So you got a girlfriend? What the fuck do you care? I be fucking. What the fuck you laughing at? Nothing. You got a girl? Yeah, I got a girl.

You should know that considering that all the prints are lying right there in the dirt. Well, you could have reloaded. But I didn't. I'm telling you guys the truth. Look, I wasn't going to turn you in, and I'm still not going to. I came down here to be a photographer. That was my dream, and it still is. I don't want to turn you in, because I don't want to give you guys a reason to kill me. And since I'm not, you don't have to kill me, and I don't have to kill you. I want to go home, and I don't want to be afraid of looking over my shoulder and seeing you guys there. You talk about trust, right, and that I have to earn it? Well, here it goes. I'm going to trust you not to kill me, like you got to trust me not to turn you in. Is that a deal? Yeah. Sure. Once I put this gun down, there's no takebacks. Can you all agree to that? Then here I go. [GUN CLICKS] No, I'm going to put the gun down on the ground, and I'm going to turn around. And I'm going to walk away, and I'm not going to look back. I'm going home.

When I make a mess, I clean it up. So hand over my motherfucking camera. I don't want to get no blood on it. [SMACK] ROBERT: [COUGHS] Why can't you just trust me? Keith trusted me. G-RIDE: Keith's dead, motherfucker, and so are you. [GUNSHOT] What the fuck you do that for? That was for Keith. Nigga, you know he wasn't gonna turn us in. How the hell would we know that? Because he earned it. Bullshit he earned it. What? Playing basketball, shooting up some motherfucking bottles? June, he will still turn you in. No, he won't-- not me nor you. Ain't that right, Robert? ROBERT: A deal's a deal. What's it going to be Shade? You going to live up to the deal? You might as well kill me. Look at you sticking up for his motherfucking cracker. You ain't loyal. Why the fuck would anybody trust you? Motherfucker, I'm giving you a chance to live. Show me some fucking respect. You don't get no respect from me, nigga, you fucking sell out. Kill me. Kill me. I'm gonna kill you. Five, four, three, two, one. [GUNSHOT] [PANTING] That's for me. I trust you. Tell me Keith's alive. He killed him. He stuck up for you, man.

I need to explain-- Shh. I don't want to hear no more. I don't want to hear no more. I've had enough. [CRYING] I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. DOCTOR: Mrs. Walker, Yes? Your son, he came in with a critical gunshot wound to the chest. However, he's a very lucky young man. The bullet missed the pericardium by three centimeters, and we were able to stop all hemorrhaging. He'll be transferred to ICU where you can join him in a few hours. Looks like he should do just fine. [CRYING] ROBERT: Oh my god! Oh my god. Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you. Thank you for saving my son. [MUSIC PLAYING] - Ah, so sweet. - Then that's the one. [ZIPPING] [SIGHS] Wish me luck, Syd. Good luck. [MUSIC PLAYING]
