There are many great men To them, my salutations There are many great men In the mirror of their hearts they behold the moon-like face, beauty and behavior (of Rama) And experience supreme joy of Brahmananda To such ones , to them my salutations. Sir What is the reason for the name "Rhythm of Love" for your award winning album? Rhythm of love The heartbeats of love "Rhythm of love" is my humble salutation to the love of the invisible power who made me who I am. You are the first Indian to achieve this award. What do you feel about it? There is no such thing as the first Indian or the second Indian, my friend. Whenever I earn something, I always feel that there is someone who shows me the way. I am unable show arrogance, by forgetting him. A few years back, you presented a symphony in Calcutta. During a press conference at that time, I had asked you who was the one, who taught you music. The answer to that? At one time, music was the medicine to my pain. It was due to that music, that I was expelled from the college where I was studying. Until the age of seven, my father told me I was bright. From the age of 8, my uncle presided over my education and other matters. In the place of my father who had called me bright, my uncle called me a loser. My uncle, who made me a loser, loved the cane that he used to hit me with, more than he loved me. Before he hit me, he would caress that cane. When I saw the love he had for the cane, I used to wonder whether my aunt had given birth to that cane. Between dawn and dusk, every day, I used to get 20 hits to my back. That was his dose. The beats fell where I could not see, and I counted their sounds as the first words of music. To not feel the pain, my mother asked me to chant God's name in my mind, in tune with the beats. I did so. That was the beginning of my music. My mother is my Teacher. You had told us that this album is an offering to a great man. Who is he? He is the King of Music. The light that he gave me, is the symphony "Rhythm of Love" that has brought you all before me. Day after tomorrow, at the Grand Theatre in Melbourne, Australia I will receive what you all call, the most greatest prize in the field of music. In my mind, there is a pair of feet, to which I will offer that prize. The feet of a great king, who cherished the light of music in the pupils of his eyes. See this picture? It is a special instrument that is stored in the chapel of Holy Father College, where I studied. This is the place, from which the heartbeats of that great king, emerge as music. If I listen, I can still hear those heartbeats. The beginning of "Rhythm of Love" is from those heartbeats. Papa! Papa, please don't leave me alone. The dead will come back. I am now alone, Papa. I have no one now. Don't cry, Mary. This is foolishness. It is not right to awaken those who have died peacefully. They cannot speak. Your father who lies here, was the light of your home and the breadwinner of the family. He has gone forever. In this life, you have to wait for only one person. The lover who you love with all your life, Nikhil Maheswar. He will come. He will wipe your tears. Open the gates to Heaven, children. May his wind, light and music come to this lamb. Stop! I told you to stop. Who told you to change the dialogues I wrote and show this nonsense here? If this is the case, you need not direct this program. Father, isn't it enough to say dialogues when needed? This is a musical, is it not? The importance is for music, not dialogue. What was the story that you wrote? Mary is the only daughter of a wealthy lord. Correct? Get up. She fell in love with a foreign musician by the name of Nikhil Maheswar. Mary's father was angry. Correct? Get up. He opposed the relationship. Mary did not give up, and continued to love Maheswar. In the end, the father is flat and Mary has won. He agreed to the marriage. Correct? Yes, correct. Then what happened? Nikhil Maheswar who went back to ask permission from his parents, stayed there and never came back. The saddened Mary waited for Parameswar--- Maheswar Ha, waited for Maheswar and got old. Without staying to see that, Father left his body here and left with his life. That is your story right, Father? Nice. That alone, is not my story. Mary is still waiting for Nikhil Maheswar, who left her. Not one or two, but thirty years, she has been waiting for him. Ah, that is what I said! Such passionate love should not be shown through dialogues. We should make that love should flow into the viewer's minds like the Niagara water falls! Lost in that, the viewers should forget everything and be fixated like ice-fruits! For that, there is no other way but this! Father, move out of the way. Children, get ready! Madam saw us taking Father into the ambulance. I'm the Principal. She is the patron. Once she knew Father was in hospital, she send a notice saying we don't need the program at all. Christ, how can that be? Convince her otherwise, somehow. What if I'm not there? Anyone else could direct this program. By whom? Bring someone from outside. If you bring someone, he should be fabulous! Only then can we go to Delhi and compete with other colleges. Otherwise it will be a grand failure. We need someone who can understand us. Where can we find such a person? I had turned the key for her to dance yesterday, it is now that she started to move. Eh? This is not the usual tune that she sings. Why has she changed her tune? Some dancing dolls have more than one tune. It plays a tune at random. This is the first time. She usually sings another tune. Father, wait. I know this music. I had won the Kalathilakam prize at high school, and this was the musical theme for the final round dance. His name is on the tip of my tongue.. That album was first presented in Calcutta. That day there was some fight between him and the organizers. It was in the papers. Vishal Krishnamoorthy. Oh, my Kishnan. He sings very well. He's even better at beating up others. Moorthy and Keerthy is for you people. For me he is Kishnan. My Kishnan. He was a student of this college. He was up to all sorts of mischief. There was not a single program in this college, without him. Look, his photo. Where? Let me see. What is this? Father, where is he in this picture? That smiling one wearing the robes, is me. The one with the rope to its neck, without the robes, without the smile, is the cow that used to give 26 litres of milk. He took that photo, on my camera. How is it? The cow is great. Ah, she used to give 26 litres of milk! Father, are there no photos of him? No. There was a photo of me and him. He took it with him. If you call him, he will come to direct this program won't he? If he comes, this program will be much better than we imagine. But I should get him. Where will I search for him? 8 or 9 years back, he send me a song from this album. Then he send me photos of antiques and wrote to me saying he was in that business. Now there is no word from him. Given his talent, he should be somewhere in Paris or America. Hey, you have a phone call. Who is it? You have a phone call from Ithaq, come quick. Phone call from Ithaq? He is lying here. Why should he call from outside? He can tell me here. Somebody took your truck and went. Ithaq! My God, did my truck go? Ithaq! The lights have come, my truck is here. The lights are on. Now the governor will come, flexing his muscles. Here he is! Now the thugs will come. Weren't there three of you who get beaten up? Where is the third? Oh, there he is! Now where is my Ithaq? Ah, there he is. What is this Governor, I took money from you to buy this truck. Not to buy Ithaq. Then why are you taking him away? Tell him. I want my money back. I want to see it now. We had said goodnight and slept, where did you go? I went out to the toilet, and that man put a cloth over me and took me away. So you didn't urinate? No. He punched you? I bit someone. When? And then they manhandled me and gave me the phone and told me they will kill me by 4:00 am. Now there's only little time left, right? Yes There is still time until 4:00 am. If I was a little late, I would have had to give money for your funeral. I didn't have money to pay the 9 month's rent. The business is a complete mess. I only want to escape from here and go somewhere else. Here is your money! Come, let's go. I need this truck, and I need Ithaq to look after my matters. How will I give your money back if you take both from me? From where did you get so much money? It's not money, you idiot. The Governor is smart, he didn't break it. Start the truck. I'm tired of getting beaten up. All the time, it's the same. We've gone through this for so long. Is there no end to this? Today where did you get beaten? To the nose. Since I ducked, my nose is saved. It is saved. I won't escape like this every day! No. If this goes on, it will be my head next! Yes, it will. Why is my life like this, Ithaq? Whatever I do, nothing goes right. I spend 5-6 lakhs for a music album, it was a flop. I started a school for music, and it got closed. All these antique stuff, brought from foreign markets, remain here, unable to go abroad. In one matter alone, there is progress. Which is that? Our debts are building up like a Himalayan mountain. Do you know how much of debt we have now? You can laugh! From dawn, the endless calls start. The check has returned. The draft flew away. Where is the interest? Didn't you say you would pay them the day before yesterday? I'm so tired of all this abuse! Don't cry. We'll go somewhere, forget our debts and live happily. If this goes on, we'll both go mad in a few months. Then someone will take us away and give us a shock treatment. After that, we can forget all worries and live happily ever after! Where are you going? To urinate. Won't you allow that, now? The Governor will pick you up again if he sees you. You do that through the window. Through the window? Opposite to that, there is Azhaki's STD booth. This too is God's STD, she won't say a thing. So there's no problem? What does that mean? Go sleep. Dear God, don't take away my eyes. Ithaq, you have a phone call! You have a phone from somebody. Who is it? I don't know, it's a phone from somewhere. Who is it? She doesn't know, it's a phone from somebody. A phone from somebody? What phone is that? I'll go check. It's not some call from somewhere. Father is calling you. Father? My father died 28 years back. Is it now that he got a phone connection? Not that father! Your old Principal Father, from college. He's calling to tell you something important. He's probably calling to give me a sermon. You tell him something and put him off. He's a good man. We don't owe him any debt. Then why lie to him? Tell him I just arrived from America, and taking rest. What if he asks me when you will wake up? Tell him I'll leave for Paris once I wake up. Why not make it farther? Is there no place beyond Paris? Then tell him I'll go to Uzbekistan. Vietnam. Or grandmother's Azerbaijan. Okay Father. Yes Father. Azhaki, Father will send the matter through fax. Turn the fax on, will you? Azhaki's fax is always on. I know that. Father talks as if he has a big order for Annan (Moorthy). Mother Mary, may all of his troubles vanish with this fax! I don't know how busy you are as you're reading this. I've written everything in detail. We're inviting you to stay with us for a few days. If you accept our invitation, it will be a blessing for all of us. Seeking your address, I had gone to your house. Your mother recognized me immediately. What's up? You've read the letter 3-4 times already. What did you decide? It's about some program of theirs. It won't work out. I'm not going. You told me only last day that you wanted to go somewhere else, away from all this. You got the chance now, didn't you? If I go there to regain my peace of mind, the memories of the past there will destroy my remaining peace of mind. I hate that college, Ithaq. I was innocent, and why did the management expel me for no fault of mine? After that, have I ever got lucky? The wandering that began there brought me here. Whatever you say, no, I'm not going. Whatever started from there, why don't you finish it there? Everything will be fine after that. I'll make up some excuses to keep away the people whom we owe money to. Besides, in time, won't we get new buyers for this antique stuff here? Can I tell you something? Music is your God-given gift. See? Father is calling you to begin again. It's not right if you refuse to go. Ithaq, you have a call! There comes the telephone fiend! The debts won't end, and she will break that window if she continues. It is broken! What's the clapping for now, Ithaq? With the arrival of Vishal Krishnamurthy, many miracles are about to happen. The same madam who told me to cancel the program, called me yesterday and told me something else. If you earn the gold medal at Delhi, you will all get a personal scholarship for completion of the course, from madam's personal fund. Madam has a special love towards this college, and you all. All of this was made by her father, William Ignatius. A small school started in memory of his dead wife, has grown into this great institution, Holy Father College. Madam was a visiting professor here for about 16 years. She has a doctorate in music and literature. It is not me who is giving the scholarship, children. There is no use in saluting me for the scholarship given by madam. You work together, and earn it yourself. Look behind you, son. Dear God, how long we have waited! Are you from America or Paris or.. Here is our Vishal Krishnamurthy. We wanted him here, he has come for us. I know no one greater than him, to introduce you to. Okay, you can call me Vishal or Murthy. This is my college. There is nothing here, that does not know me. If I stand here, I can hear my old voice. If I close my eyes, I can see my friends. I don't know, who made you invite me here. Whoever that is, I thank them. You called me, and I came. Now you must tell me what I should do. My God.. I have heard this before. Who is playing that? The tape is running. Who are you? Sir, I'm Sneha. Oh, Sneha. Mary! Nikhil Maheswar's Mary. Since you said you didn't like being waited on, we were walking around in the verandah and the grounds. I fell asleep. I couldn't sleep last night. In the story that you wrote, there is a scene where Mary first professes her love for Nikhil Maheswar, right? Yes. I read what you wrote. It's a grand bore. I changed it. Beautiful Mary is the only daughter of a wealthy lord. Right? Yes. She has good knowledge of music. If the knowledgeable Mary has to love the commoner Nikhil Maheswar, then there should be an uncommon skill in him. Right? If not, she would not wait for the Nikhil Maheswar who left and never came back. No, she won't wait. That's why I said, there was an alluring power to his love and to the music he gave. Somewhat like this. Did you compose this? Not me. Nikhil Maheswar. Think like that. Close your eyes and listen. Wonderful composition. I have listened to your work, Black Memories. This melody sounds somewhat similar to that. Yes, yes. Excellent work, son. Now the program has come to life. Now there's nothing to think about. This will be great! Oh, beautiful flower. Give your scent into my heart. In return, I shall give you the nectar of desire. Oh, colorful bee. How many times have I sung! All my scent has changed into sweet dreams and vanished. Does it have the colors of the rainbow? Is it as cool as snow? Could you tell me one more time? The mountain top has become snowy. The yellow leaves vanished in the snow. The scent of the earth has gone from my mind today. Oh flower, I shall give you the pollen of a new song in your ear. Let’s get on the chariot of love. And sing a tune. I’m not a touch-me-not plant. Not just a silent girl. No, I won’t sing. I don’t need the tune for the unsung dreams. On this shelter of dreams, the moon smiles. I have changed into a poem within you. In my mind, the honey oozes. The spring of love prevails. When the valleys sing. When the lotus pond tires out. The moonlight spills into me as fragrance. When the Arabian dreams bloom When the blue waves move The forests hum the sweet song. Who are you? Laila, the beauty of love? Who are you? Majnu, the gift of love? You are the dawn of the clear tune in my heart. Mary. This joy will only bring you pain. I'm not a suitable man for you. I can only love you. I can never make you mine. Stop it. The name of Nikhil Maheswar's lover is not Mary. Don't address her as Mary. Father had written her name as Mary. Yes, I had written the name Mary. Mary is a nice name, isn't it? Mary is a good name. But Mary was not the one who loved Nikhil Maheswar. Then who is it? You have to change that name. I will tell you now. We must give her another name. Yes. Aleena. Call her Aleena. She is the lover of Nikhil Maheswar. Call her Aleena. But the name is a good one. Should we change it? Yes, we should. I've been hearing the name Mary for a long time. I feel it is not right. Let Mary go, we need only Aleena. Let it be. The program has to be good. Okay. Come on, Manoj. Start from the last dialogue. Mary, this joy will--- I told you she is not Mary. Aleena. Call her Aleena. Aleena the great. Aleena is one who preserved the purity of her mind, till death. There should be respect for her, even when you speak her name. This conversation is to be changed. Say it like this. Aleena. Speak. If it is my music that you love, then once the music fades, won't your love vanish as well? Aleena, why do you love me like this? A foreigner, who arrived from some other place. For whom this land is not his own. The dialogue is wrong, Father. Aleena. Tell me. Why do you love me like this? Maheswar. When you address me, I can't differentiate between the music and the love in your voice. In the light of the sun, here you stand before me, shining. I'm the one playing the role, why is he kissing her hand? I'll do it again. I'll kiss her as much as I like. Who are you to ask? He does not know me. I'll crush him to pieces. Don't make me do it. Who is he to push me? I can't do this with someone who can't differentiate between life and drama. Leave me, I am out. He made a mistake. Let it go. Stop crying! That dialogue of yours was good. Ani, that will have become recorded. Write it down, don't lose it. What is this, son? What happened to Manoj? Is he mad? Why are you so angry about this? Why did he make up that dialogue? He only wanted to kiss her hand. You think she didn't understand that? You're foolish. Let him kiss her once. After that, you're supposed to say that same dialogue. You could have used that chance. And now, not only have you spoiled that chance, but she has also become quite taken with him. Now there's no use wailing about it. You just watch. I won't let him do this program. Manoj! I've heard that he's an old villain of this college. He's going to see what's real villainism these days. I'll teach him that. I can't believe this. I would have found peace in the Lord now. Is this how you hit the brakes? Bag. Here, I've given you 5 rupees extra. Careless one! Jesus, there are no lights here. Have all the bulbs gone out? Or did they get stolen? Oh Jesus, you have given me light. What is this, a naughty ghost? Or loose contact? Who is that? Who is playing with the lights? Take your hand off the switch. Who is that? I'm Ithaq. Pithaq? Which Pithaq? Not Pithaq, Ithaq! If you want to know which Ithaq, come here and see! Who are you? I'm Father. Then I'm the Mother. Huh? Who are you? Were you playing with the lights? Which light? Jesus Christ! What happened? That's what I don't understand. The lights go on, then off. And then when I looked, there was this man with this white thing around his neck! With that, all the lights went out! Who was that? I don't know. I ran into the hostel. The students showed me the way here. Why did you come during the night? You could have come in the morning. I started from there by morning. I reached here only by night! I didn't think night would fall so quickly! I came to tell you everything in person. The bank has sanctioned a new loan for us. I've brought the cheque book, you sign in it. Also, two new buyers have arrived. There is demand for a lot of the antique things. We'll give them away, right? None of these things occupy my mind right now. Only an Aleena and a Nikhil Maheswar. Who is Aleena? The lover of Nikhil Maheswar. Who is Nikhil Maheswar? The lover of Aleena. Best! I'm glad that things are moving forward. If you plan to write all night, I'm going to sleep all night. When will you turn off the light? When I feel like it. That's enough! Only, you have to feel like it! I'll sleep now! Aleena.. I will come back. At some point in your period of waiting... You will hear my footsteps.. Ithaq, don't touch my hand. I told you not to bother me, you monkey! I didn't do it! Then whom? I don't know! You don't know? Won't even let me sleep! Who could touch your hand while you're writing at night? This is very simple, Father. Vishal, Even earlier, there was some problem with you. Whenever you do something related to music, you forget everything. Whenever we concentrate and write a word, the mind travels faster than the written word. The mind grows eager to write the next word and because of that, it pushes the hand to write faster! No one else touched your hand, it was your mind. Whose mind just closed that door? Ask like that! It was only the wind! I will prove it. Look. On the two sides of this room, there are buildings. The wind from those places come together and travel into the room as one single current. Then, the door closes. Don't fear. The wind that opened the door now is the reaction to the wind that closed it earlier. While he was walking through the corridor, a window slammed itself upon Manoj's face. His subject is Physics. Even then, he didn't understand that. Hm.. many rooms here are locked up. Inside closed rooms, the air pressure will be greater. The air badly wants to go out. And during those times, doors and windows that have bolts will open up. I see this always, Father. Today morning when I entered the bathroom, I had closed the door from inside. And it opened all by itself. Shame! No, I had closed the front door. Oh, Jesus. Yesterday night, what happened? When one bulb lights up, the other goes out. When he lights up, the other goes out. It was full of loose contacts. I have repaired them all. Now now bulb in this area will light up without unless someone switches them on. Enough. Father, tell the students that there won't be any rehearsal for 3-4 days. Those who wish to go home can go. I have to settle few matters. Vishal. I had to tell you something. Father, the rehearsal can't be held for 3-4 days. I have to settle some other matters. Parameswar! Coming, Madam. Parameswar, do you hear that? Who is playing it at this time? I too, hear it. Perhaps any of the students..? Students? Which students? I didn't store it in the chapel for the kids to play with it. No, it's someone else. I have to know who it is. Come with me Parameswar, we shall go and see. No Madam, it's late. It's not good to go there during this time. We shall investigate tomorrow morning. It's over. It's gone. Now I don't hear it.. Who is he? Why is he sitting there? I'll close this entire campus. Throw him out. It's not like that, Madam. Please. Don't make an issue out of this. He is not the bad sort. Don't you dare touch this! Madam, we invited him here. I know him! I had sent him out of here once. How could you let him enter this place again? Who gave you permission for that? I did not keep this here so that he can play with it as he likes. I did not store this here for that purpose. Kishna, son.. Don't worry, Father. What does she think she can do to me? She cannot do anything to me. She has done everything to me that she possibly can. Send him out! That was long back. Eight years before. That time, you sent me out saying I came in here and played this thing. You prevented me from completing my studies. Didn’t I write a letter stating that I was not the one who did it? I had fallen at your feet. I pleaded with you to let me write my exams, at least. I’m not the Vishal whose life was destroyed after he walked out of this college. I'm an invited guest. I was invited here neither by you nor the Principal. So for now, you can go. Don’t touch it again! If anyone touches this again, it will be me. I will be the one playing this next. Madam Angelina Ignatius. I had a mother who advised me to forgive you for the wrong that you did. If you try and throw me out again, I will forget the promise I made to her. Why did you play it, son? I did not play it, Father. But I heard you play this last night! I was not the one who played it, Father. Then who played it? I don’t know. Don't make me go mad! Father, don't get worked up about this. Whatever she says or does, I will not go until I learn the truth about this. I want to know for whom, and for what reason, I endured so much pain for all these years. I will find out. I won't leave without finding out why. So who is your Mary, Father? Which Mary? The character in your story. You named her Mary. That Mary. Oh, that Mary. I didn't have anyone in mind when I named her. The students wanted a program. And they wanted a story. They wrote a few stories themselves, but I did not like them. I told them one story that I had in mind for many years, and they liked it. It had a female lead. Since my mind is always fixed on Mother Mary, I named her Mary. Now you have took her out and gave her another name. Now she is yours. And what about him? Who? Nikhil Maheswar. A name like that could not have come into your head just like that, Father. That is true. I was thinking of a name for him, when I came across an essay presented by Madam on the poems of Colridge, during a vocation class. I was drawn to a particular sentence that she had written in it. What was that? Like the great oceans filled by God, love flows about me calmly. In it, the poetic Maheswar in my heart goes on without any sense of direction. It was a poem about love. I took the poetic Mahewar, and attached the name Nikhil before it. And he became Nikhil Maheswar. What are you thinking about? Like the grand oceans filled by God... Love flows calmly all around me. In it, the poetic Maheswar in my heart goes on without any sense of direction. That flow does not seem right, Father. Does she have an affair? What?! There's nothing between me and her. I wasn't asking about you. She could love anyone else. Do you know from where she got that musical instrument? Perhaps it was gifted to her by him. Could a lover gift something this big? There are lovers who give greater gifts, Father. Tell me the truth. Is there someone in your knowledge, to whom I can inquire about the past? Well, there was a Father Kuruvila, but he left for Germany. There is Father Rector, but there's no use asking him. He can't hear. Yes, there is a Father. Father Steva. When Madam was little, he was the lion here. Now he's lying in our old age home with a cross to his heart and his face towards Christ. For a long time, he has been saying that Christ will call him soon. He hasn't called him yet. Come. Principal Father sent him. I have heard everything that Father has written. That musical instrument was given to Aleena by her father a long time back. Aleena? Who is Aleena? Madam's name is Angelina, right Father? At church, she was given the name Aleena. You have said the name that everyone calls her. Not many know the name Aleena. Long back, it was handed down to them. We called it "Seven Bells". To play it, a man came from the west. He and Aleena were in love with each other. What was his name? It was a long name.. Do you remember it, Father? Books can be found in the library. Didn't he marry Madam? Before that.. Maheswar left. Who, Father? He went to ask permission for the marriage. He did not come back. She is still waiting for him.. What is his name, Father? When did he go? He never came back till now? Father is like this these days. Once he talks about something he remembers, that will stay in his mind for sometime. He won't say anything for a long time. It's alright. I will sit here. I have many more questions to ask him. I will be here by your side, Father. What happened here today morning! We heard from Father that madam came here and scolded you. I too had come, but when I saw how angry madam was, I went away. Why are you here now? I heard you playing this last night. I've only seen this here, I've never heard anyone play this before. I intended to come during the night, but Annie saw me. Otherwise, I would have come. Why is the bell ringing now? You didn’t know? There was an old Father here, who used to be Principal. Father Steva. He died just now. Love of my life, where are you now? When will I see you again? Love of my life, where are you now? When will I see you again? I’m grieving like a hornbill. From my eyes fall the tears like flowers. Love of my life.. Where are you now? The shore and the waves do not know, The sorrow of the ocean. The rain and the sunshine are unaware, Of the screams of the wandering wind. Before I drown in the sea of sorrowful tears, Before I fall on the burning coals of sorrow, Won’t you come to caress me In these lonely moments? Love of my life, where are you now? When will I see you again? My eyes brim with tears, my voice falters. The pain flows unknowingly. Knowing no place or position, My desire seeks. In my heart there is just one unrealized dream. Just one insatiable thirst stays. When will you come this way? To sing a song of love? Love of my life.. Where are you now? Seven Bells. See? This should be one of the books that Father Steva told me about. There will be others as well. Here, the Seven Bells that Madam has stored in the chapel. I did know that madam has never married. But I did not know that she was in love with someone. She did love him. A sort of deep passion. Madam’s father William Ignatius invited a musician from Agra who knew how to play it, and made him stay here. His name was Maheswar. The Maheswar whom you took from Madam's essay, and the Maheswar whom she loved, was the same person. At that time, she was 18 years old. He stayed here for around 5 years. They loved each other. Even though her father opposed the relationship, he agreed to their marriage. But that marriage did not take place. See? This is his handwriting then. These are some musical notations. Do you know? Father Steva told me that Maheswar left to ask permission for the marriage, but never came back. Madam had faith that he would come back. But sometimes she felt fear. She would run to Father Steva. She would ask whether Maheswar would come back, Father told her he would. As the years passed, the intensity of the waiting grew. Even today, she cleans the instrument and waits for him. Father knows this. After telling me about that pain, Father Steva has gone. Now, Madam has no one whom she could call her own. She is alone now. Why didn't he return? That is what I don't understand. Either he has met with some accident. Or perhaps he is living in Agra, married to someone else. I don't know. That is their business. What interests me is this handwriting of the man Madam loved, which no one has seen for this long. I need to play this in that instrument. Let Madam hear, I don't mind. So you played it the other time too, didn't you? Until now, it was not me who played it. But now I won't go until I play this on that. Sneha! Catch it! If she comes here hearing this, it will create problems. Do we need to do this? Already I’m in trouble, what more could go wrong? Play it carefully! If Madam comes hearing this, I don’t want her to see me. I’ll stand aside. My God... It was this composition, the one I heard. What is it, sir? We have to go somewhere. Can’t you see? Didn’t you see the closed gate? Who told you to close it? It’s such a big gate, can’t you keep it open? Sir, you see this? I knew you would get injured once I saw your hysterics. Don’t make it worse by looking at it. She doesn’t even know how to fall from a cycle. What is this? Stop! I need to see Madam. What is the problem here? I need to see Madam. Will he open the gate only if I come by car? Won’t he open if I come on a cycle? There is no use creating a scene. No one can go in without permission. Then you go get the permission! Tell her it is Vishal Krishnamurthy, the one to whom she spoke all kinds of nonsense at the chapel. She will agree to see me. You can't meet her now. Who are you to tell me that? Sir, Madam told me to let the man in. See? I told you. Madam will call me. She has to. Sir, what about me.. You take care of your wound. I will return after meeting Madam. Don’t just stand there with the tie around your neck, help her dress her wound. Who are you to behave rudely to my helpers and order them around? I don’t wish to see you, nor do I have anything to say to you. Please leave. But I have to talk to you. Otherwise, Father Steva will be angry at me. I was the last person he spoke to, before he died. Not only you, I knew him too. That was why I came to the cemetery. I saw you look angrily at me then. Madam Angelina Ignatius has to understand one thing. I don’t know anything about you, nor do I have any interest in them. But you have to know who I am, and why you kicked me out of this college. I did not know that you were dusting the instrument in the chapel and waiting for someone, all these years. When I was a student here, you alleged that I played it and kicked me out of the college. I maintain that I did not play it, back then and now as well. Sneha, who accompanied me here, also knows that I can’t play it well. Are you lying to me? I heard you play it! I saw you sitting inside the chapel! Enough. Madam saw. I was sitting there. Both are true. But this is what you heard, isn't it? Was this written by me? How did this.. From where? When? In your hands..? I know who this belongs to. Isn't this the music that you hear? You're waiting for him to come and play this on the instrument in the chapel, aren't you? I came here under the compulsion of Father. Not to settle scores with you. When I came here to direct the program, the story that Father wrote started to change through me somehow. I don't know how it happens, it happens. The heroine in Father's story is a woman who is waiting for her lover. Her name was Mary. It began from there. Somehow, I got another name in the place of Mary. What name? It is there in that music. After many years of love, the lover who could not return after he left, is calling out to his love. No! No! He will come. My Maheswar will return. He will play on that Seven Bells. He will tell me why he left me alone for so long. I have to hear that. That is your story. Why did you harass me for that? Why did you stop my studies? Why did you kick me out? I repeat, I did not play it. It was someone else. Someone else. Isn't that his handwriting? Isn't that the music you hear? How can I play the music that no one else knows? You are right.. This.. You do not know this. Oh God. God. Why didn’t I think of that? I’m sorry. Please forgive me. I don’t know how to give back your lost life. I have wronged you. I have wronged you. I will repent in any way I can. I can arrange for you to resume your studies. Or... can I give you a job here? You can ask.. Can I give you money? Or... Everything you said is right. I am waiting. For my Maheswar. But this handwriting is not his. I wrote this. He sang this for me, I wrote it down. That one thing you said was wrong. I’m not wrong, Madam. I know this is not his handwriting. He has not seen his handwriting. Maheswar could not see. Who said so? His sight was better than yours. There is nothing in this world that he has not seen. This is the language of love, Madam. Others will not believe this. Every day, every time, only the truth should be said. Only then can Maheswar tell you why he has not returned after so many years. Aleena.. Maheswar.. I called you. Is she insane to love a blind man and wait for him all these years? I’m telling you the truth. If you have a good mind, then believe. If you don’t, then wait till the good mind arrives. He was blind. Total darkness. In that darkness, there was the light that fell like this lightning. That was their love. Once I understood that, all the anger I had for her went away like this rain water. She is a good lady. I have no wrath towards her now. What is gone is gone. I’ve went through everything there is to bear. If she is sorry about that, her heart will be pure. In truth, I want to meet that Maheswar. Where could he have gone, leaving this sweet girl here to cry for him? Isn’t it enough if we investigate that after the program? I’ve told everyone that we’ve temporarily stopped rehearsals because of Manoj’s injury. Before we resume rehearsals, I’m making another change in Father’s story. Starting from today, the hero of our story, Nikhil Maheswar, is blind. Is that necessary? Isn’t it enough that we tell our story? No. We are telling the story of Aleena and her lover, Nikhil Maheswar. Aleena’s Nikhil Maheswar is blind. I don’t know what power is making me think along these lines. But starting now, I’m going to listen to that power. Sneha told me that you will be here. Have you forgotten your hate towards me? Or is it still there in your mind? I used to hate you. But now I respect you. It’s not the respect that others give you because of your money and power. There is something to be respected in you, beyond all that. What is that? How beautifully you love someone. That too, someone who has not returned in all these years. I too, think such thoughts sometimes. Father Steva used to tell me that it was foolishness to wait for someone who has not returned. That if I keep waiting, my life will be destroyed. But if I don’t wait, what gets destroyed is the love that Maheswar has for me. Love is a faith. The faith that Maheswar has me, and that I have him. When that faith ceases to exist, that day both of us will cease to exist. Can I ask you something? How did you find my name? Didn’t I tell you? Your name is there in Maheswar’s music. Yes. How did you recognize it? Those are just musical notations. It’s impossible for anyone to understand the words in a song by studying the A minor and C major. I know it’s impossible. Music is not something that can be read, if it’s written for you. It should be sung. The tunes and melodies of a song must be conveyed by the singer. Even when I was a student here, and I addressed you as Madam Angelina, I never knew your real name. Then how did I know? I knew. My mind told me so. That’s all I know. It has been 30 years since my father died. I come to this cemetery on most days. I tell my father everything that has passed. My father was a good man. Even though initially he was against the relationship, towards the end he too wanted me and Maheswar to marry. The story that Father wrote is similar to this. I had never told my story to him. You told me that the students’ story was beginning to become my own story. No, that is not needed. I don’t have to know my story through someone else. It is for me to live in. Maheswar and I wish to live together for a long time. We’re not together, but I’m here seeing all this, am I not? He should be there somewhere, thinking of me, right? He should be. He should be out there somewhere. What was he doing here, for 5 years? Not 5. He was here with me for 6 years. When he said he was leaving, there was only one regret in my heart. He was unable to finish the musical piece he was working on then. I had copied down that music. I had lost a sheet of that work. That was the sheet that you gave me that day. Was it a part of that work, what you said you heard me playing during the night? Don’t talk like that now. You did not play it. I was thinking of it for so long, so perhaps it was a feeling of mine. Without that understanding, I did wrong and that gave you much pain. Please consider this visit of mine as one act of repentance. I have a request. Please finish the program for the students. Father told me the students like you very much. Not just them, I too have taken a liking to you. You were right that day. Maheswar could not see. He was blind. Holding his hand, I had walked through these ways many times. I don’t know what he saw that day, in this light. But the joyful beat of his heart as I explained everything around us, I can still feel it here. Still it’s here. Touch me. You can feel it. Is it there? Do you feel it? Yes. I feel it. Maheswar.. Where have you gone to, leaving me behind? After a long time, I talked about you to someone. I came here hearing you play this. Why did you stop? You should not come here alone during this hour. You didn’t like me coming here, did you? Fine, you can sit and play. I didn’t know that you were playing for Madam Angelina Ignatious. She is not Angelina Ignatious. Aleena. Aleena Ignatious. A virtuous woman who lives in pain, waiting for her lover to return. You should not talk of her in jest. Is she Aleena? She is Aleena. I’m not the one who plays this for her to hear. Then? Go sleep. No. I want to hear. I heard you play this. I too heard it. I too hear it playing all by itself on some nights. You’re just trying to scare me, aren’t you? No. It is true. Someone is here with us, close to us. Yes. See? I knew you would be scared. Why did you have to make me tell you? Who is it? I don’t know. You should listen to what I say, without fear. That time when we went to the bungalow, the cycle crashing against the gate was not an accident. At that time, I had not seen a gate there. I came here to tell the story of Father’s Mary. But someone is making me change it into Madam’s story. Who is that? Is it her dead father? Or is it her lover Maheswar, who has not returned? I don’t know anything. One thing, I know for sure. There is a power, somewhere in this atmosphere. That power has something to say to somebody. Yes. Somebody wants to say something to someone. Manoj! Manoj, wake up! Wake up! Everything has gone out of hand. What? He has stolen your fruit. Come! See? Your heart’s desire is walking around with him for honeymoon after the first night. For everyone else, the rehearsal is held at mornings. For her alone, it’s at night. I thought they would hug then. He’s decent! You come. Let’s give him a beating in the dark. If we beat him up in the dark, he’ll give us double beating during the day. I’m not coming with you for that kind of thing. Wait. Where did that dog come from? Dog? Leave me. If it sees the stone, it will be angry. Drop it! I told you to drop it! Run! Get in! Quick! What is this? Running around during the dark and scaring people? Father, dog! Huh? Dogs, Father. Dogs like elephants! They chased us. To escape from them, we ran in here. There it is again! It doesn’t sound like the bark of ordinary dogs. This is cross. What? It's a German-British cross. That's a cross breed. How did they get in here? If they're not caught and thrown out, they won't let people walk by even during the day. Take the stick under the bed. I'll take the chain from the store. Yes, you can stop here! Thank you very much! It was a very pleasant trip. I'm saved! Hm, I think this is Doberman! You know how to smell and identify things? There used to be many dogs at the seminary. I watched over them all like they were my kids. If you let them go at night, many of them won't come back by morning. Without leaving out any of them, I would smell them out and put them back in their cages. I'm not just a dancer. I'm also a good dog trainer. Do you know how many police dogs I've trained? No. I hear footsteps.. The dogs got in here? I'll run this way! That's a dog indeed! You should be careful of dogs that move slowly. They might jump at your neck. Then what will happen? Will we die? Don't say nonsense. When it jumps, just sit. It will go over your head and fall on the other side. Then, turn around and beat it like this! Huh? Are the gods here? There's only one way to escape. I'll just make the dogs think that I'm a dog as well. Then the bag..? That's not good. Didn't I tell you? It's a Doberman. It's tail has been chopped off. A dog moves faster if you cut its tail. You can't catch it so easily. See the girth of its back and legs! Now there's nothing to wait for. If we miss this one, we'll miss all the other dogs. Doesn't matter if we get bitten, we have to catch it. Come, let's catch it! My God! So many dogs! From where do these pastors get dogs like these? I don't know how I escaped! I need some dog to drink! What? Water, I need water! Bad, we missed it! Who told you to hit towards the right? A Doberman always turns to the right! Then couldn't you have hit it towards the right? When both of you hit towards the left, I too did the same! The dog ran away through the right! Father! Look, I got a shoe! What kind of dog wears a shoe? Oh, this is Shoeberman. You call it "Kodichipatti" in Malayalam. Horse wagon! There's a horse wagon! Horse wagon! Where is the horse wagon? How fast it was! It came straight for me and hit me. If it came so fast during this time then don't fear, you were dreaming. You're sweating profusely. Did the horse chased you over a long distance? I'll get you some horse to drink, no, water! No, I don't want it. You remember we have bought one Nizam's horse wagon, and sold it out under great loss? Perhaps you went to sleep thinking of that. That's why you had that nightmare. I don't even think of Nizam's horse wagon and all such matters these days. Then which horse wagon? What are you thinking about? Alberto! Haven't I told you not to come sleep in here? You told me to clean it up, that's why I came. Why are you still standing there? Nothing.. Are you seeing a horse wagon for the first time? I'm storing it in memory of my father. Why did you ask me whether my father had this kind of vehicle? Did Father Steva tell you about it? No, it's not that. Yes.. yes, this same horse wagon.. I dreamed of this horse wagon! A very... frightening dream! This same vehicle. When I ran forward, I heard the horseman telling me to move out of the way. I too see such dreams. Tell me, was I there inside it? No, you were not there. Then was Piyusha there? Who is Piyusha? Piyusha is our horse. She used to take me and Maheswar on this vehicle, to every place. Aren't there two horses for this wagon? Yes, there are. Piyusha and Puno. Piyusha was very loving towards Maheswar. Can I show you someone? Whom? Come. Maheswar. This is Maheswar, right? He was so young... Such beautiful music he composed, and he was so young. I imagine his appearance now, looking at this picture. His hairline must have started to recede. Since he couldn't see, he always used to walk with his chin slightly lifted. He would still have that dignity. There will be wrinkles on his face. But that light in his eyes would not have disappeared. He must be thinking of me. He will never forget me. He won't forget me. Sir, do you want a vehicle? I need a vehicle that can knock someone down. You have a vehicle like that? He wants a vehicle that can knock someone down. So what? We can provide him that. My vehicle is best for such things. Is this enough, sir? How far will you fly, after you've knocked me down using this vehicle? Will you fly to then end of this world? If you do, I'll catch you there. You can tell that to whoever it was that sent you. Why did you knock me down? Laurence told me to! Who is Laurence? I don't know! He writes with chalk on top of vehicles, the name of the person and the fare. Where is it written? It's there. Got out of there safely, didn't you? This happens here often. Many have died here after getting beaten up. Fertilizer for the trees, what else? This place is not very good, Sir. You should be careful. Some people are like honeybees. Even if they themselves die, they'll make sure their victim is stung. Sneha told me once, that she is Aleena. Maheswar is seated near the Seven Bells. Aleena has come to see him. That is this scene, right? Yes, this is one of my most favorite scenes in this play. Since you invited me, I couldn't avoid coming here. Now when I see this, I feel like I'm present somewhere in your story. Maheswar... Why do you fear? I have only come to see you. Aleena... Until you are mine, I will always have this fear in me. This darkness around me shows me the footsteps of someone approaching, just behind your voice. We are alone here. See this.. No one has accompanied me here. What's the matter? I'm seeing my own story before my eyes. Maheswar has told me these same words once. Aleena. Why do you always come here without your father's knowledge? Have you gone to visit Maheswar like this, without your father knowing? Yes, many times. I had never wasted even a moment of the time I had to be with Maheswar. It was like being in the presence of God. Music every day... Music every hour... My love, when I hold your hand There is a sea of divine light. In the vision of my inner eye, you are a crooning dove. The bridal dress is ready. The meadows have bloomed. The lamps are lit. The wedding altar is ready. When are you coming back, when are you coming? To make my life’s dream bloom with love, When will you come back? The coming night of spring, I will come to make you mine. I will wait here, like a dove that will not fly away. On the wings of the rainbow, I shall rush to your side. Until I come, I give you my voice. Aleena... My love, when I hold your hand, There is a sea of divine light. In the vision of my inner eye, You are a crooning dove. When are you coming back? Aleena! Go! Go home. I should never see you here again! This is my only daughter. It is under her persuasion alone, that I'm ready to welcome you. You are a thief! No girl will love a blind man like you. Aleena has fallen in your trap. I’m unable to save her from you, which— At what moment— Wait. To save her, I have so many methods. To save her, I have so many methods. That is not the dialogue. You have to forget my daughter. Apart from that, you may ask me anything. I will not watch my daughter living with you, a blind man. If she does not withdraw, I shall cut your music away from you! I shall cut it away from you like this! No! What have you done? Did you invite me here to see this? Is this my father? Do you know my father? My father was great. Greater than anyone in this world! From where did you get this story? But Madam, in the story--- No! I don’t want to hear anything. I don’t want to hear anything. Disburse everybody and clear this college! What you just showed is cruelty. Even if it’s just a story, how could you have my father cut away the fingers of Maheswar, in front of my eyes? I never want to see you again. Son... What did you just do? I don’t know... I just, all of a sudden... Sir! What happened? I don’t know. It was not what I had written earlier. Good for him that he drew his hand away, otherwise he would have lost his fingers. Didn’t we put the table there, in place of the Seven Bells? Yes. Didn’t I cut his fingers by placing his hand on top of it? Yes. Yes... What are you looking for? See? What I said was right. Doesn’t this look like someone cut it? I’m sure of it. Somebody cut away Maheswar’s fingers here. I can smell the blood. I'm scared. Let’s go. Let’s go, please! What are you doing? Has Madam told you not to let me in? Yes. Then I’ll go in. I’ll leave only after I see her. I will kill you if you try to prevent me from going in. No, please don’t harm me. I’m the manager. If you want, I’ll inform her of your arrival. You needn't, I'll go and tell her myself. Let me just say... If you come after me, I'll kick you! Go stand at the gate! I should never see you after her again. Parameswar! No Parameswar or Parvati will come. If he comes in here, I'll beat him up right here. And if that happens, you will be responsible. Didn't you pause the rehearsal with authority, saying you were insulted? Didn't you send all the students away, claiming I did the wrong thing? I was silent, not because I was afraid of you. I was pained, thinking of you. I'm telling you now, I told the truth. If you don't believe me, come with me. I will show you the moistness of his blood. Get out of here! I don't want to hear anything! I'll go only after I'm finished, and you have to listen. You betrayed me. Even though I asked forgiveness for what I did to you, you are trying to get back at me. When you got the chance, you tried to create a drama out of my own life, before my eyes. You're making a mockery out of my father and Maheswar, and settling scores with me. I won't allow this! Stop it! I didn't have the need for a drama to get back at you, if I wanted to. I told you everything once. You forgot all that! You forgot him calling you Aleena. You forgot hearing his music! You still have time to believe me. I did not come to get back at you for what you did. Something made me come. I don't care about that. You should leave! When I say someone made me come here, I don't mean you or Father. It was someone else! Otherwise, who is putting all this into my head? Who is making me speak all of this? Is it your deceased father? Or is it the Maheswar you're waiting for? Tell me. Tell me! I'm telling you... The Maheswar whom you wait for, will never come back. Get lost! I don't want to hear anything! You have to hear! Look carefully at the Seven Bells that you wipe every day. You can see on it the mark of the knife that chopped away his fingers. I'm not telling you this to get back at you. I'm telling you of the pain that he went through once. Someone chopped away his fingers. Maheswar is somewhere, without three or four fingers like these. Either with the desire to return... Or in another world of music, from where he cannot return, I'm sure of it. No, that cannot have happened. That is just a story. A story you made up. It's not a story I made up, Madam. Someone is telling me this story. A story that I feel, is true. I'm saddened that I have to hear it. And I'm pained that I have to tell you that story. You may love him and wait for him, that is your choice. Whether he comes or not, is his choice. I don't have to know of that. But there is someone behind me. No matter what you say, I will not leave until I find out who that is. Perhaps the mark was not due to a knife. Any wood will develop cracks with age. Maybe that's why it was polished. No. The mark of the knife was polished. Dog, stop there, dog. What is this? There are very fine dogs out there, Father. One in your room, and one in mine. When I opened the door, both of them ran away. They can't be let off the hook like this, ...dog! From where did all these dogs come from? Those are not dogs, Father. Not dogs? Then why are we hearing these barks? Those are just sounds without forms. Tell them not to run after those sounds. There's no use running after it. What did you say? Did you see dogs just now, Father? No. Many are running about, but did anyone catch a dog? No. That's why I said, those sounds don't have bodies. They are just sounds. Will anyone be able to catch a sound, Father? It's not that, son... How did William Ignatious die? I heard he died in some accident. What if he commited suicide, unable to bear the pain of seeing Madam marry Maheswar? If that was the case, won't Madam tell us that? Madam has never told you that Maheswar was blind. What if this was something else that she never told you about? No. Madam will never lie. Is it because of William Ignatious' death, that Maheswar has not returned? If he knew of the death, he should come back due to his love, right? I think he cheated her. Father. Can we go through those books in the library again? What if we find some old diaries of William Ignatious in there? We'll have to search a lot for that. Do you have to go read at this hour? Are you scared, Father? No, I'm not afraid! Then come. We didn't get it. Isn't that a dove? Yes. Is that just a sound without body, as well? There's the dove! Which book are you looking for? Any old records containing information about Madam and William Ignatious. This section is for Physics and Chemistry. I've seen a few books in that shelf. That too, is a dove. What are you looking at? Who is in that glass case-- Are you seeing this now? For a long time, it was kept in the store room. Sometime last October, a Professor and few students repaired it and kept it here for a science exhibition. Did they buy this? It's an original skeleton. Plastic skeletons are also available. But the original one has a look of its own. From where was this found? It was found during construction work of the new hostel block. The Principal at that time told them not to put it back in the hole, and kept it here. Why, does it look familiar? Why are you looking at it like this? I was wondering whether it had lost a few fingers. Don't think of unnecessary things to frighten others. Are you frightened? Of course not. I did feel a little odd after coming inside. Since you're with me, I got some courage. There are some more books in the next room, I'll show you those. Here, I've found four or five. Where did he go? Son! Did he leave? See? It's rotating all by itself. This is what I told you about. For what purpose are you searching for someone who left this land a long time back? You're no relative of his, right? Then why are you trying so hard? I told you, let it go. I've been following you ever since that day when you visited Aleena's bungalow saying you saw some dream. I also heard that today, you went there and left her terrified with your tall claims. What do you--- I remember Madam calling your name. Alberto. You were William Ignatious' horseman, weren't you? You're right. I was a horseman then. But today, I'm her caretaker. Let her live as she likes, waiting for him. You should not harm her again. Your pursuit of Maheswar, should end with this wind. You should leave this place at the earliest. What if I don't go? You will go. I have tricks with me that will make you go. See these? These are charms. I need to only whistle, and dogs will come flying. They will tear you up alive, without even giving you time to scream. Do you wish to experience that pain? Alberto. Alberto! I know you're hiding in here after challenging me. No matter how long I've to wait, l'll find you. No! Don't play this game with me! You will not be able to stop me. I won't leave without defeating you. If there is any truth in your words, tell her the truth before one of us dies here. Who chopped away the fingers of Maheswar, whom she waits for? Why did you come here to know the fate of someone who left this land long ago? To die? You don't know the fog in here that blinds you. You don't know the trick of hiding in between these trees and attacking someone. Go! Go away! Save me! Please save me. I'll tell Aleena that you've told the truth. Please save me. Don't get in! If you do, you'll sink. Stay there, don't move. I will save you. I don't want to kill you. But you have to speak the truth. You have to tell Aleena everything you know. This is my fate. Do you know who? Him. The Maheswar who brought you before me. If you know it, then tell the truth. Why did you chop off that good man's fingers? It was not just me, who did it. I was forced to do it. If I could get a footing... I would have gone over to tell her that... Her father, whom she worships with flowers, is more of a sinner than I am. How did you figure this out? Even he didn't know that I chopped off his fingers. Aleena! No, not here. Bring him outside. Aleena! Go on. Aleena! Piyusha! Piyusha, calm down! They buried him alive. My intuition was right. Someone wanted to say something to someone. And for that, he chose me. Even though he gave me a lot of pain, he showed me the way and told me everything. Innocent. She is innocent. All this time, she didn't know a thing... She placed flowers on her father's grave... She paid the horseman his dues... And waited for the Maheswar whom they murdered. How will I tell her this? I cannot do that. You should tell this to Madam. She should know that Maheswar will not return. She will be devastated at first. But... Isn't it a greater pain to wait a whole lifetime for someone who can never return? No... I cannot tell her this. What is happening? Maheswar... Madam. Madam. There is a power in you that I cannot see. If not, my Maheswar would not have come searching for you. Tell me... Somewhere, you have seen my Maheswar. If you have at least a small amount of kindness... Can't you show him to me? You should not go there. Where is she going? To the library hall. Madam should not go there! Have you seen a skeleton there, kept inside a glass case? That is Maheswar! Madam, don't go inside! Sir, don't go in, please! Maheswar...
