This programme contains very strong language. MUSIC: Changin' Times by Ike White To me, Jimi Hendrix was no more of a star than Ike White. GUITAR SOLO Ike had a mind of his own and was very... ..rebellious as an artist. He refused to do the norm. Yeah, it was good stuff. He was talented. It's been a long time since I heard this. He's, like, way ahead of his time. REPORTER: Ike White is a musician, a professional featured on his own current album, but Ike White doesn't do the personal appearances and concerts that other artists do. Ike White can't. He's doing a life sentence in prison. GUNSHOT His story was pretty serious. He was in prison for murder. And listening to this reminds me that it could have been all that. You know, a lot of potential. It was all there. He could have been a big star. With the story, oh! The story was amazing. Surely heaven is just... ..a few bars away. After all, I've already been through hell. What happened to this? Did it ever see the light of day? What happened to Ike? MUSIC: Changin' Times by Ike White I've never had a friend as close as Ike. We were together all the time. Well, I met Ike at Tehachapi State Prison. He and I had both came from maximum security prisons, so... ..we considered ourselves best friends from that time forward, really. Inside prison, it's a whole different world. It's a rough situation. Every day there was a fight. People were getting stuck, people were getting killed. It was just a war zone. I mean, I knew I was going to come through it. Well, Ike had that same kind of mentality. He knew that whatever happened, he was going to come out on the top and he was going to be able to persevere. I've been stabbed three or four times, I've been shot, man, I've been beaten, I've been overdosed on Thorazine by, you know, guards and the like, and I've still, you know, I've still managed to overcome all this madness. GUITAR SOLO When I first saw him, he was playing guitar. I mean, he had a lot of tunes in his head and a lot of rhythms and things, and we'd just get together and make some music. He was in a small cell, but it was large enough for the keyboard and for Ike to be there, and I'm usually sitting somewhere on the side, and that's...that's how we made music. At one time, his job was to clean up the gas chamber. The person that was in charge of that eventually allowed him to bring his harmonica and guitar there. HARMONICA PLAYS So he'd finish work and then go sit down in the electric chair and play the guitar. HARMONICA PLAYS I had been going to jail since I was 11 years old. I was a thief, I had done just unspeakable things to other human beings. Never was into drugs, never raped women. You know, those were a couple of things that I hadn't done yet, but no telling where I was headed because I didn't have principles. I eventually joined the Black Panthers and got involved in this shoot-out. GUNFIRE Went back into prison. I was there when he got there. You know, this guy with long hair. You know, very hippie-ish kind of style about himself. Very confident... ..erm, guy. Big eyes - looked like a deer caught in the headlights. He was called Ike. Ike was very serious about his music and rehearsed and practised every day. It was like another world to go into Ike's cell and sit in the dark with the music reverberating off of the wall, and you had already smoked a joint, or if you were able to get a tab of acid or something, you know, you were, like, in a... It was almost like you were free. It all served as evidence that we didn't have to be worthless, that we could be something, that we could transform ourselves. That change could take place. We are men! We are not beasts and we do not intend to be driven or beaten as such! This is not a riot of prisoners who are seeking to escape, it is a riot of prisoners who are spelling out conditions which they feel should be improved. To change forever the ruthless brutalisation and disregard for the lives of the prisoners here and throughout the United States. What has happened here is but the sound before the fury of those who are oppressed. Right on! Right on! Ike was affected by this new upsurge in consciousness around who we are. It was, erm, "we are somebody". CHEERING We were on the brink of an experience and a ride. The prison system would never be the same. We're going to open up tonight with brother Ike White, who has a selection of numbers. Brother Ike White. Brothers and sisters, you're in for a good treat tonight. We've got some very good entertainment here for you. We're all doing time right here in this prison, and we've managed to express ourselves musically. OK. # Brother, you've got to get yourself together, yeah # You've got to realise what it's all about... # REPORTER: This is California Men's Colony at San Luis Obispo, part of the state's prison system, but it's here, in this unlikely location, that people in the music industry say they've found a star of tomorrow. I'd just finished with Jimi Hendrix, who had died, you know. I helped discover him, and we'd heard about this new guitar player. His name is Ike White and he's in jail for murder one and, you know, we should check him out. So we took a trip to the prison to meet him. I was very surprised how young he was and how vibrant he was. And then he says to me, "Oh, you know I sing lead vocal and I write songs." I got very excited about recording someone in prison. They all thought I was crazy to do it. All the people that I talked to in the prison system, "Why are you doing this?", you know. And I went, "Because the guy's got a lot of talent, "and it's a shame that he did what he did, "but this is a chance for him to rehabilitate and get out "and be a real person that makes money, "and you don't have to worry about him any more." And that's how I sold it. Eventually, we got the OK... ..so we bought a truck and built a mobile recording unit. First class everything. And when the truck got there, they practically stripped the truck down. We must be smuggling drugs or something into the prison because why would anybody do this, OK? We were really smuggling in food... ..and they ate like crazy. We started feeding the prison guards. # It's a must... # And we brought in this girls' group to sing, you know, sing background vocals, and that made everybody happy. # They say we need more rehabilitation # But instead they give us aggravation... # And, erm, we began recording. # Yeah, I see you walking # Strolling right on that street corner # You ain't nothing You think you're cool, don't you? # But you about the most untogether brother # I ever seen in my entire life # Look at you # Super duper # Hey, plastic man, man, man # Super duper # Plastic man, man... # It was about him being super duper plastic. Wow. He has all these things going on and great plans, but the plans were plastic. # Got the nerve to think that you've got all the answers # The great American dream you say is well... # It was about him being super duper plastic and not a real person. Is that how he felt about himself? I don't think it was about... ..the super duper plastic man was about him. That's definitely not the way that he felt about himself. He's the most incredible human being that I've ever met. You would see him playing bass, then you'd see him playing guitar, then you'd see him playing keyboard, and then it's like, "Oh, no, drummer, too?" He was a master at every instrument. # They say we need more rehabilitation # But instead they give us aggravation # Insensitivity just ain't our bag # But doing this without you is a drag... # He had a way with the women. You know, he'd get them on the phone, and that's it, he'd melt 'em. He seduced my secretary. I don't know what he said, but it was the way he said it, I guess. He was kind of, sort of, amazing. # Do it, do it... # I was 19, 20 years old. He was very charming, you know, and engaging and soulful. And I was always very attracted to that in anyone. We were married in the prison. Were you scared to go in there? I didn't know fear at that age. I was a very naive... ..young woman. I had grown up on a farm in Delta, Colorado, and lived a very happy childhood with my great-aunt. When I was 19 was the first time that I even was aware there was any such thing as a street life or a prostitute or a pimp or somebody who went out and robbed all the time. What did he tell you about what he'd done? He said that... ..he was on drugs and he committed a robbery of a liquor store... ..and that as he was backing out, his legs hit a newsstand... ..and the gun in his hand went off. And the 85-year-old man who owned the store was shot and died. Which is first degree murder. He was sentenced to life. His music is what kept him from being a prisoner in his own mind. That was how he escaped. And he was loved for his music inside prison. I think there was a certain pride or a hope that seeing someone else who had a life sentence be able to accomplish something as big as recording an album inside prison... ..that there was hope for them, too. # There was a time when life was so simple # I was a carefree young man # The old folk said, "Now, sonny # "Enjoy yourself while you can" # Oh, the times they are changin' # I need love to get along. # Changin' Times was...it was like our song. It was our message. And what is the message in that song? Well, you got to do a different thing with life. Just, you know, know it's going to be greater later. # And now my life is so damn empty # I've got the blues deep in my soul. # I would say he really put his heart into that song. It seems like one part of that song is, "I got to find a way to change, to carry on." Find a way. # But the times, they are changin' # Make no ease to keep from wrong. # Changin' Times was about... ..incarceration and changing his life. The fact that times changed while he was inside. The fact that... It was about a lot. # I've got to change to carry on. # We were going to have a life together and a family together, and we had Anastasia, our first child. And I was 100%, day in, day out, devoted to getting my husband home. About that time, Stevie Wonder and myself, we were doing some recording together, and I mentioned Ike White. And I remember Stevie stopping and doing that little look that he does, you know, he stopped and paused and said, "Ike White, I think I've heard of him." So I told him about Debra, and he says to have Debra call him. And I went to where Stevie was recording. And I waited... And I waited, and I waited, and I waited, and I waited, and I waited for Stevie to come out. And I put my baby in his arms and I said, "Stevie, I need your help." He wanted to hear Ike's music, and then from there, it took off. And then he visited. He helped to get Ike a new attorney. REPORTER: It's one thing to teach yourself music under the watchful eye of a prison guard. It's another thing to translate that knowledge and skill into a new life in the outside world. Can it be done? Ike White is still waiting for the answers and hoping the answer is yes. Do you remember the day that you found out Ike was going to be released? Well, it was a phone call because he had met with the parole board, and they gave him a date for release. And I was very happy. It's almost like it's a "pinch me, is this real" kind of feeling. Yeah. He'd been inside for a long time? 14 years. I remember it was an overcast day. He came out, he was - I could tell - happy, but nervous. It's a big change. I assumed that Ike was going to go big time. It just seemed like he was on top of the world. I didn't know anyone who had achieved such a standing of success, who had such gift and opportunity. You make plans when you are locked up that you're going to do A, B, C, D. But when you get out of prison, you don't owe nothing to nobody, really. Most of us don't have a realistic expectation of what's going on out there and how you can fit in and how you can get your life going for you. You know, getting out in a world that you don't know how to operate in and having people have you stereotyped. And you have to go through life concealing who you really are. You don't just jump in an ocean and swim out 50 miles. You paddle in and you find your way in. I think some of the time he tried to jump out and swim 50 miles and got very lost. He was not as focused on his music as he had been before. I tried to line him up with Stevie again, and we went to Stevie's studio, but that didn't come to fruition. He was making some choices that made it very difficult. And I left twice and came back... ..twice. The third time I left was the last time. I was pregnant. So Angelique was actually a re-uniting baby... ..on the last time. You know, it was very difficult for him. You know, once he was out, to figure it out and to maintain it... He was just his own worst enemy. He thought he knew more than anybody else because he was always figuring another angle. When I finished the album, CBS offered us a movie of the week to tell his life story. So we get to Ike and he thinks it's a really great idea, but he won't let anybody play him, he has to play himself. That is never going to happen. And that was very frustrating, and that was like, you know, pretty much the beginning of the end of our relationship. He could have been a star. What did you last hear about Ike? I don't know what I had heard, but something about a circus or some carnival. Something I'd heard about Ike... He'd gotten into some conflict with somebody. And so he had changed his name to David. And he was no longer Ike White. People were looking for him. Various different gangsters. And that was the reason that he changed his name. His mother's maiden name was Ontiveros. So, at one time, he was David Ontiveros. I mean, that was his stage name. Seemed like he was running for something, or searching for something and never finding it. You know, that's my sense. Do you know what name he might be using? The last time I had heard from him - this is when he was in maybe San Diego - it was David Maestro. Introducing Maestro, the ultimate performer for a grand evening of big band swing and classic oldies at their best. # I guess you wonder where I've been # I searched to find a love within # Oh, I came back to let you know # Got a thing for you and it won't let go... # ANSWERPHONE: One new message. This is Lana Gutman, David Maestro's wife. David has agreed to talk to you about Ike White. Tell me when you can come to San Diego, and David will pick you up from the airport. We're in Oceanside, California, which is right near the ocean. Four-bedroom house. A very serene atmosphere. And I have a great relationship with my wife. We're happy here. We're just very happy. It's a beautiful change from what I've been through in my life. From the time I was 18 till I was 32, I was in prison. I made a mistake. I paid for it. You know? Oh, my God, I didn't... Jesus. I'd never told anybody about my background after that. You know, just the few guys that did know, you know, so they had died or something, or whatever. They thought I was dead, or something, and... Yeah. And so I started my life again... ..you know, as David Maestro. When I met David, I've worked in a hair salon. I met him and I fell in love. And I'm very happy. OK. Open. What is with...? It's really... It needs to be sharpened. Well, I have here a small one, OK? Maybe use the new one. Lana has been an angel. She came here from the Russian way of living. And she really appreciates the American way of life. Oh, yeah? You can make it on the bottom yourself. You want to see? Well, I look like I did ten years ago. Mm-hm? You look very young now. Sexy. HE LAUGHS He never had a wedding before, and I never had a wedding before. We wanted to have a happy ending. It's nice to wake up in the morning and be in love. He's very talented. He likes to make chandeliers. He likes to sculpture. TOY DINGS, BUZZES, PLAYS MUSIC He made fish, and painted them. He shows his creativity everywhere, because when he was in prison, he had empty walls. This way he escapes from reality, forgets about his past. This is strictly medicinal. I've got a doctor's permit. He gave me the prescription over Skype. This is really good medicine for me, to deal with the hardcore realities of life. It sort of smooths things out. What are you doing? I'm refreshing. My friend is coming over, so I don't want it to smell like pot. And David's forgot he's supposed to smoke outside, you know? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Jesus. I am the one who deals with reality, because David, he's artistic, a musician, so his world is completely different, you know, from other people. HE PLAYS ELECTRIC PIANO I was a child prodigy. So I played classical piano with my mom, and we always had music in the house. I was practising forehands Chopin with her. And my dad was a very talented musician. He was a keyboard player for Ella Fitzgerald, and they were always over at the house rehearsing. I was like this, just glued to the... You know, in front of them, checking it all out. And I learned a lot. I got exposed to that type of music. Then he started playing clubs, making pretty good money at first. He worked for the Italians in Chicago. They opened up a lot of Mafia-owned clubs up and down Chicago, and they preferred him to open up for them because he had such magnetism. One day, while playing at the club, he died of a heart attack, while he was playing. He was laying there, just motionless. And I went and kissed his forehead. It was like steel, it like cold steel. And I always remember that. My mom was stuck with five of us. We were poor most of the time. We moved to California after that, to be with my mom's sister, in Paradise Cove. And it was the first time I saw "White Only" signs. I just went in to buy milk one day, and the guy told me, he says, "Nigger, get out of my fuckin' store." And I was 17. Never heard that before - really heard that. So, anyway, I went and told that to a black guy I knew. And he says, "What?!" He said, "We're going to Atlanta," because the whole thing was brewing up there, because Martin Luther King has stirred up a lot of things, you know, back then. So we drove down there from California. # We shall overcome... # I remember...thousands - it seemed like thousands of people were walking down Main Street in Atlanta. And I was three rows behind Martin Luther King. I had a nun on the right hand, and then I had a Jewish rabbi on my left arm, and we were singing We Shall Overcome, and I remember how elated I felt. God, I felt like, "We're all, like, one mass body "of people," you know, and it was like, "Oh!" A very powerful feeling, very... # Oh, we shall overcome some day... # Very wonderful. SIRENS And then we had to come back through Alabama. God, that was, like, the worst... ..back then. They were still lynching and killing people back there. And so the cops stopped us. They found some marijuana in one of the guy's pockets, threw us all in jail, beat the shit out of us. I remember they hit me in my jaw. And they had clubs that they hit me, but they knocked me out with a club in the back of the head. They woke me up with water and asked me more questions, and then boom - then knocked me out again. Then woke me up with water and knocked me out, I remember, three times. After that experience, I came back to California. I had no father and a mother on welfare with four younger siblings. I went to Oakland, and I got a job with Big Mama Thornton. # You ain't nothin' but a hound dog # Been snoopin' round the door # You ain't nothing but a hound dog # Been snoopin' round my door... # # You ain't nothing but a hound dog # Cryin' all the time... # Yeah, I remember that, man, and playing with her. And, anyway, I was playing and I was under age, of course, and it's hushed up about, and they didn't tell anybody. You know, I couldn't drink alcohol. And, my breaks, I had to go in the back and hang out. On my break, these two guys said, "Hey, man, you want to make some real money?" They showed a couple of wads of 100 bills, and... "What do I gotta do to make that kind of money?" And they said, "Well, you just drive a getaway car." And I said, "So all I gotta do is drive the car?" And then they said, "Yeah, that's all you gotta do." "Oh, oh, oh... "..OK." "Damn, this is it, man. This is my new vocation." For a getaway car, we had a hearse. And we put stockings over our face. We were known as the Stocking Cap Gang. That's what the media called us. Three or four robberies every week. We had robbed 27 Safeway stores, man. But the inevitable happened. We were backing out of the store after getting the money and this kid ran right into the store, ran right, smack into us. We thought somebody was trying to jump us. The gun went off... ..and hit the store owner in the lower abdomen. We heard on the news the guy died. God, that fucked me all up. I remember how... What was his name? John. John, his name was. And I regretted it every day. I mean, I dreamt about the guy. I saw his face in my dreams many, many years afterwards. I wasn't a killer. I didn't go in there with the intent to hurt anybody. It was an accident. Was 19 years old, man. And getting down to a life sentence. I thought I'd die in prison. What have we got there, David? Oh, so this is my daily ration of pills, and it's good stuff. You know, because it's, you know, I'm still here, kicking. Can't take them all at once. We got to take them a little bit at a time. My wife is the pharmacist. And she's like the perfect friend, you know? I'm so proud to say I'm married to her cos she's so beautiful. God, I wake up every morning in love with her. Every morning I wake up in love with her all over again. She's marvellous! Two, three, four... # When I first met you, pretty baby # My life was a perfect...# I'm happy. I love you. I love you so much. # When I first met you # Pretty baby # Life was a terrible mess...# I like his music. Nothing turn me on more than his music and I love it. # Real strong...# Long as I got you, everything is OK. # Yeah...# I'm also his manager. Hold on one second. I'll transfer you to him. # I want to thank you for sticking real close to me...# Hello. I'm trying to push him ahead and trying to make a record deal. David Maestro will do the production. It's my company. OK. Awesome. I really wanted David to be back on the stage where he belongs. Thank you. I tried to introduce him to everybody. This is how things work in Hollywood. OK? OK. Thank you. Whoo! Give me a little more reverb going round, will you? Or some echo or something. ECHOING: Two, three, four. # We can make it if we try...# I need you to cuddle me. Kiss me! THEY GIGGLE I love you so much. Leah, how are you? It's Lana. David Maestro, his wife. How are you? David, he's performing there today. Yeah. Got to go. Yeah. We gotta hit it. All right. OK? OK. Bye-bye! We have David Maestro in the house. This guy, right here, he's like a legend in music. He has done music with Lionel Richie, Quincy Jones, Michael Jackson. Put your hands together for David Maestro! CHEERING There are a lot of people in Beverly Hills who just have no idea about my background. I want them to know, but I want them to know my way. Why do you want to tell your story now? Because I'm getting old and I realise this story, I have a story to be told and, I mean, it's a true story. I've experienced in life one extreme to the other. I got pictures and documents. All kinds of stuff revealing my... ..my whole identity, my whole past. I'm no longer Ike White. You know, I've progressed and grown in great leaps and bounds. I was born with a birthmark butterfly on my leg. My mom told me, "That's significant to you in your life." I could fly away and be colourful and just really shine in this world. And so, I've kind of held on to that. I'm no longer Ike White. I'm David Maestro. And it's a new birth. We went to the ocean for a walk, and he didn't want to come. He preferred stay home, alone. After... ..one hour, I receive a text message...from David... ..saying... .."I'm going to make changes in my life... "..make changes in my future," if I held on. Arrived home. And he was... ..hanging on a wooden beam... ..around all this psychedelic art he made. And fish. He was right there. I took his hand. He still was warm, but no way I could pull him out, you know? I still don't understand... ..how he didn't see... ..his future. We had plans for the future. # Oh, the times they are changin' # I need love to get along # Got to find someone who needs me # Real strong # I've got to change to carry on # I've got to change to carry on...# He kept so many things for his past. # There was a time when life was so simple # I was a carefree young man # The old folks said, "Now, sonny # "Enjoy yourself while you can..." # See, he was handsome. Very handsome and sexy. His address books. Are they people you recognise? No. Anyway, what is this here? David White. Do you know what's on any of these tapes? No, because I don't know, even how to check those tapes. So who's David White? Is David White before David Maestro? It's David Maestro, his stage name. And he's also Ike White. And who's... but that's David White. Who's David White? David Ike White. So David White... Is another name. It's another name, yeah. It was a name he used, David. Why do you think he had so many names? He didn't want people know he was in prison. So he never used his real name, Ike White. What is this? What does it say? Audiotape. It's audio. MALE VOICE: Uh-huh. DAVID: Carl, what's the name of the song? Super Duper Plastic Man. # Brother you've got to get yourself together # You've got to realise what it's all about # I worry about those payments on your Broomhill # With your children hungry and down and out # Trying to keep up with the latest fashions, yeah # And your parking money going to the pusher man # Trying to prove real hard that you are something, yeah # With possibilities you cannot stand # Super duper plastic man # Super duper plastic man # They call you super duper plastic man # You say you're trying to do the best you can. # I thought you told me that David hadn't had a wedding before. He lied. So who's that? Do you know? No. Another woman. Two woman. Three woman. Four woman. Phone messages. ANSWERPHONE: Saved message. MALE VOICE: David, I want to know why you continually keep calling my wife. And you continually keep seeing my wife. You call her four, five times a day. You see each other regularly. And I want to know what your trip is. What's the matter with you? Why are you doing this? You are disrupting a 27-year marriage, David. 27-year marriage, David, that's a lifetime to me. ANGRILY: Stop calling my wife! ANSWERPHONE: End of message. To reply to it, press A. To delete this message... Resave. Wow! Next message. MALE VOICE: You mother fucker. CALLER HANGS UP End of message. When I met him, he had at least five other girlfriends. On the go? At the same time? Yeah. I couldn't be with him all the time. So he brought different woman to our house. DAVID: Hey, baby! When I left, so somebody else came. This was his style. # Would you like to ease my mind with some of that body # You got a body # I can't live without it... # He said he always had woman, more than 2,000. 2,000? Yeah. # I'd like to exercise my right of being horny, huh # As you can see... # He said after 2,000, he stopped counting. Oh! Angelique White. Is that his daughter? His first wife daughter. "Dear Daddy, "I love you so much. "Please come and take me back with you. "I want to see you so much." I think you should meet her. When I was born, he wasn't there. I think I was about nine. The phone rings, and it was my dad. And I was so excited. And this is the first time I've talked to my dad. And that was a big deal. And then there wasn't any other contact at all. How is this OK? This isn't fair. Later, I found out that he thought I was dead. He was told that by my grandmother, that me, my mom and my sister all died in a car wreck. And that's why he didn't try for years to get a hold of us because he thought we were dead. What was my grandmother protecting me from? The steady and consistent story that I was told is that he hurt people. He hurt people to go to prison. He continued to hurt people, hurt people, hurt people. Maybe my dad was sick. And he couldn't do family and he couldn't do relationships. It is very challenging to get out and, having to consider the thinking and the feelings and the sentiments of others, to dedicate yourself to a relationship, commitments to someone that you haven't had to do in all the time you've been locked up, and for Ike, that was much of his life. You haven't been around any of that. Um, you know, what it takes to have to raise and bring home a pay cheque for a family, to deal with their illnesses, to have to go to their schools and to put bread and butter on the table. And I think that was very hard for Ike. I don't think he, in any way, expected to be confronted with the difficulties of life that everyone has to deal with. When you get hit by that, it's very easy to knock you off balance. Another David woman. Who is she? Monalisa. David had a child together. # You are the beauty that I cannot leave alone # You are the heaven that I can't find on my own # You are the music and the laughter, yeah... # There's certain things that he did teach me, like I can catch a con like that, I know when somebody is bullshitting me, I know when they're full of it. And I know when someone's dangerous. He was 18 when he went to prison. So he built his personality in prison, and part of his personality was to con, to manipulate. And I was really naive. I didn't even know what gay was, lesbian. I didn't know anything about anything. I mean, he had these sexual fantasies of women, you know, having been deprived for so long. She was learning piano, and I would always find her in my bed, too, when I'd come home. He wanted to have more woman all the time. One wasn't enough. You know, at that age. At any age. We did share some really, really special times, and I got pregnant, and he goes, "We're going to have a family. "Oh, my God." He was so excited, and I was so scared. He actually, you know, came up with the name Kito. MONALISA LAUGHS You know, so... And when did things start to go wrong? All he wanted was to be able to record his music. He was so talented and such a virtuoso. But he couldn't get anybody to take him on because of his past. And there was some really tough times. He'd started to do some drugs. I really, you know, I left, you know. Kito reached out to him and wanted to connect with him again, and I believe that Kito was ready to head down to see him when the accident happened. He died in a car accident. Yeah. The police gave me Kito's phone. And David called Kito's phone. And I had had the phone in my hand. And, um... ..I answered the phone. When it said "Dad" on it, and that's when I had to tell him what had happened. He was, um... ..he was... ..as hard as it was, he was proud. He was proud of his father. You know? And he looks so much like him and he acts so much like him. And they had a connection, the two of them. Kito. Um... Do you want to look at the picture and see if you know somebody, or you remember something? You know, there is the numerous different women. This is Carol. Oh! Carol and him were a good mix for a while. Erm... They... ..her being a dancer and him being a musician, they were able to do Vegas together. The first time I ever saw your picture on Facebook, I was like, "You look just like I did when I knew David." And it was like I was looking at myself, and I thought that was so cute. He had love for all the woman. You know, he was physically strong and he could satisfy maybe five woman at same time. Yes! Yes! Yes! When I met him, his name was David Ontiveros. He wanted a choreographer to create a show band, and we connected like that. David was very charismatic. And I got drawn into his stories. He told me that he was in Vietnam. And he told me this very traumatic story about his wife and two children dying in a car accident. I had so much compassion for him, listening to his life story and how much it had affected him, because he was really sensitive. Good morning! I see you! Eventually, we got pregnant and I had a little boy. David, he could really relate to children and he could be very nurturing when he wanted to. He loved it. It brought him back to his childhood. Probably, when, it was probably the best, maybe, feeling that he had, just having a family. This is Baby New Age music. That is radical man! Say something to Daddy! Hi, Daddy. Hi, Daddy! This is his first day, I'm taking him to school, riding his bicycle. I'm following him to school. Make sure he takes the right route. Here we go. SMASHING AND BREAKING GLASS Oh, no! Oh, shit! The car just stopped. Hey! Dad! Dad here. And Joe. Driving. Driving to school. Driving the Baron to school. Wait, wait, give me a kiss. Mwah! And, um, hey... Got to go. ..I love you. There goes my little man, boy. There he goes. When he got out of prison, he had a bunch of kids, they didn't have any time with him. I was the youngest child, so he took care of me the most. He's history. I got to hang out with him up until I was, like, ten. He was ready to be more grounded and take me places and fun places and just a lot of fun stuff. When Baron was very young, we just packed up everything and decided to go to Vegas, realising that this place would be a great opportunity for a show band. # You should've seen me # My life was one big mess... # David loved being in the limelight. He really did. # No-one could tell me... # And he did want people to recognise this great music. # I'm addicted to your love, baby... # A couple of months later, one of the mothers of his children actually told me, "He's very dangerous," and she said he murdered somebody. And I was like, "Whoa!" And I asked him about that when he came home and he was, like, furious that she'd called. He got very violent with me. After that happened, I made an instant decision that that was it, I was going to get out. It took, like, a year and a half to two years, and then slowly... Separated. Well, he started living with another girl, and then one day the girlfriend at the time actually called me and warned me that he was on his way over... ..with a gun. I knew he was coming to literally kill me and my boyfriend at the time. I couldn't stop him. He came and he got the guy and he walked him into the house, and he was holding him, like, hostage with the gun. And he was waiting for me, and I was able to escape and go to someone's house and call the police. And then the police came and he ran out the back door and got away. He was going to, you know, be in big trouble, so he had to leave. Because he was sort of hiding, under a new guise. Yeah. Yeah. He found this woman he called his mother, and he was hiding there. Are you kidding me? For 12 years. Wow. When I met David, he was living with that woman. Hello! Hi. We are doing a documentary about musician David Maestro. He used to live here. I just knew that he lived here. He was living here with a woman. She passed, and then I think he moved out. He passed away. Oh, he did? Mm-hm. Wow. Wow. He was so creative. Yes. And when they were trying to sell the house, I saw the house and I saw what was done inside the house, and it was it was brilliant. You know, a lot of neat little decorating ideas that were pretty out there. He was a very talented man. This is where I met David. He was living here with his companion. Happy birthday, Mom. Thank you, hon. My big boy. HE LAUGHS My big boy. I love you, Mom. I love you too, hon. He called her his mother. She wasn't his real mom. He decorated the house for her. And also he made a Jacuzzi for her. And we've got a... Oh, my goodness! SHE LAUGHS Who is that? Oh... Oh, my God. No, no, no... And he took her to all his gigs. And they enjoyed each other's company, very much. Help! Say it long. "He-eelp! Help! He-elp! Hi. Hi. Did you know David Maestro? What? Do you know why he did move out from his place? Yeah, he got evicted. Oh, yes? Yeah. He had threatened some of the residents. And he told the general manager he'd kill his wife, and so that was the end of it. He had a reputation here of being hostile. I see. Well, thank you so much. OK. Good luck. Thank you. MUSIC: Changin' Times by Ike White So do you think all these stories about him are true? We don't know... ..if it's true. We have no proof. He really treated me nice. Brought me flowers every day, and made me breakfast and dinner in bed, and sang love songs to me. This is the way he was. He could've been a big star. I really believed in him. He was right in the pocket of that time. Right there. Artists have a different ego than a lot of us do. They have a need, and that's what gives them the courage to get up on a stage and face rejection or acceptance, applause or a silent room. But who you are on a personal level, for your family and at home, that determines the character of the man. That's where David was not able to be the man he wanted to be. Why did you leave? Why would you not want to be a part of my life? Why is this better? He had a lot of sorrow and regrets, and one thing that always kept him alive and kept him going forward was his music. And if he felt that the music wasn't there any more, if he was unable to see the dream through, the topper would be... ..feeling like he failed. Suicide, though, I never would've imagined that. I don't understand how he could've done that. I know he was in a lot of pain. I mean, a lot of physical pain and all of that. But... Wow. Well. How did he take his life? He hung himself. Whoa! Whoa. That's... That's hard to imagine. That surprises me, because he fought so long for a life and fought so long for the things that he... ..was able to acquire. Yeah. # Walk with love in your heart, in your heart # All you gotta do is talk with love in your heart # In your heart. # APPLAUSE AND CHEERING OK! I love hearing you play acoustic, seriously. Oh, that's great. Yeah, man. It's stripped down. HE LAUGHS Raw stuff. Well, I'm glad you like it. # Need some understanding # To help me ease my mind # Need some understanding # To help me do this time... #
