* Twinkle, twinkle little star * How I wonder - Preconceptions have a direct relationship with the expectation and realization of the concept of fear. At the moment the mind converts mental fear process into physical symptoms, then the cycle is complete. The ultimate definition of fear. - Well, I've been working on my dissertation, and I've decided to change direction. - You're still focusing on fear though, right? - Oh, yeah. But I've got a completely new angle. - Okay, and what is it? - You cannot tell anybody. - Hey, come on. - Okay, I'm gonna make a film on actual fear. - What like the Omen or something? - Thank you. - Thanks. - No. Like a video diary. Okay, imagine a documentary based on how fear can be manipulated, created. - Interesting. - Yeah. - And how? - Okay, I'm taking my girlfriends up to a cabin for the weekend. I'm gonna actually scare them and secretly film it. - You serious? - Oh, yeah. Professor French is gonna love it I just know it. - How are you gonna film it though? - I rigged the cabin with hidden cameras and speakers. - Wow, sneaky. Okay, so where does the manipulation part come into play then? - Okay, let me show you something. What color is your shirt? - White. - What color is this? - White. - Okay, and this? - White. - What do cows drink? - Milk. - Do they? - Yes. No, no, okay. Cows don't drink milk. They drink water you got me. - See. - Okay, very clever. Do something else. - Are you good at math? - I'm okay. - Alright, I need to borrow this. - Alright. - What's two times two? - Four. - What's four times four? - 16. - What's two times 16? - 32. - Two times two? - Four. - Four times four? - 16. - Two times 16? - 32. - Two times two? - Four. - Name a vegetable? - Carrot. - Interesting. - Okay, what the hell. How did you know I was gonna say that? - Did you really think that or did I make you? - Okay, impressive. - Oh, my god I have to go. - Right. Good luck to you, Mrs. Spielberg. - Shut up, Julian. - Alright, sorry. - Thanks for the coffee. - You're welcome for the coffee. - So how did you guys meet? - Me and Rachel knew each other from New York. We were in the same dorm together. - Yeah, and it was crazy. - Crazy. It was insane, oh my god. And, um. Frankie, how do we know each other? - Oh, you know. - We used to work in a coffee shop together one summer, and we've just been friends ever since. - Oh, that's fun. - And you're a dance major? - Yeah, in my second year. - You enjoying it? - I love it. I mean it's a lot of work, long hours, so there's always something going on but it's great. - Rachel can relate to that she's a performer herself. - Yeah, but you should really see Frankie dance. - Really. - Yeah. - Yeah, no. So Rachel's lame attempt at humor. We'll get used to it, Victoria, don't worry. - No way she's serious. She just needs like half a bottle of vodka and like a hot room. - And an even hotter guy. - Oh, yeah. - Okay. - I forget about that one. - Whatever Rachel you win this round. Just wait till later when we all are drinking, all will be revealed. - Sleepy girls. Wake up sleepy heads. Wakey, wakey. - Oy. Wake up. - Are we there yet? - I think so. - Oh, it's breathtaking. Ah. - You just stop that right now. What's wrong, Sarah? - Nothing, the key it's supposed to be under a rock or something. - And what if it's not here? - Well, then we sleep in the car. - Okay. - Shine the late over here, Sarah. - Oh, found it. I found it. - Technically I found it, but. - Yeah. - God it is freezing. - Here we go. - Wow, this is so cool. - Who lit the fire? - That must have been Oddle. He's the odd job man here. - Oddle what kind of name is that? - Strange one. - Looks like no one's been here for a while. - Wow, if this was my place, I would be here all the time. This is amazing. - Guys, I seriously wanna live here. - It's probably just the wind. Right, Frankie? - We're fine. - That was so weird. - Really freaked me out. - Hey, let's take these off. - Let me help you. Oh, Frankie. - Sorry, I hope you're not allergic to dust. - Rachel, do you wanna come help me with the luggage? - Yes, yes I do. - This place is unreal I cannot believe that nobody lives here. - I know, right. - That was easy. Guys, look what Rachel brought us. Small one for Victoria. - Cool. - Your welcome. Bigger one for Frankie. Here you go, Rachel. Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Okay, first things first here's to a real girl's weekend finally. Cheers. - Cheers. - Wait. A toast. May we get what we want. May we get what we need. But may we never get what we deserve. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers girls. - Thank you so much, Rachel. This is really nice of you. - You're welcome. Can't remember the last time I had champagne. - This was yum. - More please. - Good. - Wow, Frankie's on a role. Anyone else? - You can top me up. - Sure. - But I'm gonna go find out where the washroom is. - Light weight. Doesn't she work in a bar. - I can hear you. - More for you. - Yes. - Great. - She was the one that we were checking out. - Yes, that's what I'm saying. You don't remember her? - I didn't notice her panties showing though. - What are you talking about? - Nothing. - Well, don't go rushing for the bathroom. The toilet's busted but we do have a shower that works. - Yeah, he did kind of mention there may be a problem with the septic tank. - What are we supposed to do then? - Well, there's an outhouse. - Oh, there is. - Like outside. - Yeah. - It'll be fine. It's just part of the adventure. That's why we left the city, isn't it? - It's true. - Why don't we go outside for a walk before we go to bed. - What? No, it's so warm and cozy in here. Let's stay here. - Come on girls. We're adventurers. - Yeah, let's do it come on, Victoria. - Unless you wanna stay here, and then go for the outhouse in the middle of the night by yourself in the dark. - Okay, okay. No, I don't wanna do that. Okay, I'm coming. - That was easy. - Listen. - To what? - Nothing, just silence. - That's funny when do we hear silence. - It's such an observation. - I know. - What was that? - A werewolf. - Stop it. - Careful. - Guys, I seriously heard something this time. - Victoria, it's the trees. It's nothing come on relax. - So cold can we please go back inside now please, please, please. - Yeah, you know what I agree. Let's go it's cold. - This is not such a great idea guys. - You guys are so adventurous it's astounding. - Isn't this fire so beautiful. - I love it. Reminds me of camping with my dad when I was young. I miss him a lot. - Your dad died. - Yeah. He had a small plane. He loved it. He'd go away on weekends, sometimes he'd take me. He and my mom split when I was five. One Saturday he crashed into the side of a mountain. Nobody knows why or what happened. I never got a chance to say goodbye or tell him how much I loved him. - I'm sure he knew. - But that's it. He didn't. We had a fight two days before, and he called me and I never called him back. I was angry that's all. I felt so bad. Anyway that was a long time ago now. I've moved on. - He knew you loved him, Frankie. - Yeah. I wanna believe he did. - I know this is really bad timing, but I really gotta use that outhouse. - Oh, my god. - I'm sorry I have a small bladder, guys. Ugh, gross. It was awful. Don't go unless you're desperate I'm serious. - Great. I have to pee in a bowl. - Probably, yeah. - Seriously. Do you guys think this place could be haunted? - Probably, at night things will move around. - Don't say that. I'll never sleep. I have to sleep with a light on at home as it is. - Wow, Victoria. I love garlic bread so much. But every time I eat it I have the weirdest dreams. - Really. - Yeah. - What kind of dreams, Frankie? - Not those kinds of dreams. Maybe sometimes. - How's Paul? - His days are numbered. - I'm sorry. - Well, don't be it's me I'm bored. It's just too comfortable, no sparks. - So who's giving you those sparks. - Well, there is this new guy at one of the gyms I work at. - Toby? - Yes, it's Toby. - Frankie, I knew it. - Whatever. - You're so predictable. - What about you, Sarah? - You know me. All work no play. - Well, we're gonna have to fix that. - Right, yes we are. - Yeah, you have to have fun in your life. I'm gonna fix you up with someone from my work. No fun, no life. Frankie's number one rule to live by. - Amen. - Do you have any hot single ones for me? - Yeah, and there are some even hotter married ones. - Frankie. - They're the best. Seriously, there's no strings and you just get to have fun and then you can leave them. So I've heard. - Okay. - What? - We have a dark house. - Apparently. - Victoria. - I'm just kidding. - No, you weren't. - No you weren't. - Do you guys hear that? - What? - Probably just a branch hitting the roof. I wouldn't worry about it. - A lot of creaks in these wooden houses. - Oh, my god. We should play truth or dare. - No. - What, yes come on. It'll be so much fun. - Did she just finish the wine? - Come on. - Yep. - But she's got more. Please. - Okay. - Really. - Come on let's do it for Victoria. - Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. - Coming Victoria. - Rachel, you can come sit with me. - Okay. - I'm so excited. Okay. Rachel. You go first. - Okay. Oh, Sarah. Truth or dare. - Truth obviously. - Typical, typical. Alright. Where'd you first do it? - Do it? - Yeah. - Where. Where. - It was so long ago. It's so hard to remember. - Okay, I remember. In my garage. - In your garage. - I hooked up with my first boyfriend in my dad's garage. - Oh. - Who's the lucky guy? - No, that's another question, Frankie. - Okay. - What. - It's your turn. - Rachel, Rachel, Rachel. It's pay back time. Truth or dare. - Dare, definitely dare. - Kiss, Frankie. - Shots. - Did you see that? - I did see that. - Cheers. - Yuck. - Alright. - Sorry. You okay, Victoria? - No more drinks for you. - Oh, the dark horse. Victoria. - Yeah. - Truth or dare. - Dare, no truth, truth. - Have you ever made out with a girl before? - Yes. - And. - She was a girl from dance, and we were at a party. We had a little bit to drink, and we just had some fun. - Fun. - Fun. - Okay. - Okay, my spin. - Go. - Oh, yes, Frankie. - Truth or dare. - Dare. - Take your top off. - So eager. - Got the job, ladies. - Sounds like you've said that before. - Jerk. - Hey. - Okay, okay, okay guys. Put your top back on. - As much fun as I'm having, Victoria. I am so tired. I think I'm gonna turn in. - Actually me know too. It was a really long drive, which I did by myself by the way. - Well, good for you. I was also in the car but fine. - Did you hear that? - What? - That scratching sound. - No. - Did you hear it, Rachel? - No, but, I've had a cold and my ears are plugged. - See there it is again. - How are you the only one who's hearing all these noises? - Well, I definitely heard it this time. - I think it's time for bed. - Yeah. Tomorrow's a new day let's go. - Yeah, come on. - Okay goodnight guys. - Okay. - See you. - Night. - See you tomorrow goodnight. - Love you guys. - Sarah. Sarah. Sarah. - Victoria. You were out early. - There was somebody watching me in the forest. - You sure? - Yes, I'm sure I saw him. - Calm down it was probably nothing. - He was down by the water. - Victoria, once I'm dressed I will go take a look. But honestly, I think it was just Oddle. So, how did you sleep? - Terrible there were so many noises. I almost came into your room. - You should have. I mean, you know with these wooden houses though these creaks and noises are all part of the charm. It's really not such a big deal. - Morning. - Morning. Coffee. - What was happening last night? - The noises you heard them too? - Yeah, you bet I did. I don't think I slept for more than an hour. - There was a man staring at me in the woods. - Are you serious? - Yes, and why would I be lying about that? - Hi, ladies. Hey. - Victoria. Can you grab that. - Hi, yeah. - It was probably Oddle, that odd job man. - Well, can you tell him to fix the toilet. I was desperate last night, but there was no way I was going outside. This looks great. - So what do we have planned for today, ladies? - So I was thinking after breakfast we could go for a walk by the lake how does that sound? - Yeah. - Good. - Yeah, sounds good to me. Why what's the problem? - There was a man in the woods staring at me. - What kind of man, your imagery friend? - It's not funny. - Frankie. Have a strawberry. - I'm allergic to strawberries. - Guys, the strawberries are fresh. - It's so quiet. - You can hear your own breathing. It's absolute silence. The only noise is what we make. - Not last night. I wasn't making any of those noises last night I swear. There was somebody in the woods this morning. - Victoria, come on. - Where did Frankie go? - Oh, yeah, where did Frankie go? Frankie. - Frankie. - Come out, come out wherever you are. - Frankie. - Got you. - You scared the crap out of me. - Frankie. - She's not happy. - Real mature, Frankie. - Poor baby. Poor baby. - Okay, come on. - I wasn't kidding you know there was somebody. - Do you believe in the paranormal, you know like the other side? - I don't know. I mean, I've been seeing my dad again, so, yeah, I guess I do. - I've had strange feelings before. - Like what? - Like I've known things I shouldn't know. Know about a place and I haven't even been there. - Like deja vu. - Yeah. Sometimes I meet someone and it's like we have a connection. Like I've known them before. - Like you've known them in a past life. - Yeah, but really know them. Sometimes I even know what they're gonna say. - I've had that before. No, it's like there's a connection at another level. - Don't fight it. There's a theory that primitive mankind are psychic. They used to communicate just by thinking. Kind of makes you wonder why did language evolve? - Well, to express more emotion. - No. - Why then. - To lie. - That's freaky. If you were psychic, then you couldn't lie. - Exactly. - And the human race thrives on greed, which needs lies to make it all work. - That's way too deep for me. - Just think about it. Imagine you could talk to someone and know exactly what they were thinking. - My brother would be in real shit. - Victoria, are you okay? - Yeah, just tired. I didn't sleep well last night. - This is perfection. - Sarah. - What. - Okay. - Victoria. - I'm sorry, Frankie, I'll get it. Uh, it's pretty far out. - It is far. Victoria, I don't think you should go on that. - Victoria, what are you doing? - It's fine. - Victoria, it's too dangerous. - Victoria. You're my responsibility please be careful. Victoria, you don't need to do this just come back. - I got it. - You have to be careful. Victoria. - Oh, my god. - Help. Help. Help. - Help. Victoria. Victoria. Frankie. Be careful, be careful. Help. Frankie. - Victoria. Do you see her? - Help. - Sarah, help. Frankie, are you alright? - Rachel, get her a brandy. Victoria, that was really dangerous. You could have drowned. - I couldn't get my foot out. It was strange it was like I was being pulled into another world. I know that sounds weird, but I felt like somebody was in the water with me. I wasn't scared I really wasn't. - You're in shock, Victoria. Okay, sip this slowly. - No, because somebody was pulling me down. - Yes, Victoria, the canoe was. Here drink this. - You okay, Frankie? - Yeah, I'm fine. You alright, Vic? - Thanks to you. Frankie, you saved my life. - It was really scary in there. - I just couldn't get my foot out. - It's all over now. Okay, just another chapter in the book of life I guess. - Yeah. One I'd really like to edit out. I think I'm gonna go lay down. - It's a good idea, Vic? - Are you warm enough? - Uh-huh. - Rach, will you go with her? - Yeah, here. Go ahead. - That could've been really, really bad. - She could've died. It all just happened so fast. You're a real hero, Frankie. This is an adventure we're having. It's not exactly what I imagined I'd be doing jumping fully clothed into a freezing cold lake. - It'd be a pretty sweet Instagram pick though. - Bet that's not the only crazy thing that's happened here. - Yeah, this place definitely has some history. That outhouse is ancient. - Well, there was a house on this property for over 150 years. - Really. - It burnt down. But this one's pretty new. - It's crazy to think generations of people might have lived here. - My professor said that it's been in his family for over three generations. - Doesn't he ever come here. - No, he doesn't I don't know why. - Maybe he prefers to party in the city. - Professor French. He's a Arachnologist. - A what? - Spiders, he's into spiders. Spiders. - You're joking right. - No. - I hate spiders. You don't think he ever had them here though? - Then you would love Professor French then. - Sarah, I'm serious. Okay, they freak me out. You don't think there'd be any in my bedroom. 'Cause Victoria said she heard a scratching sound. - It might be a spider. - Sarah, it's not funny. - Do you want me to check your room? - Yeah. - Rachel. - What. - I don't believe you. - They're furry freaky little unpredictable critters. - Rachel, let's go. - They're cute. - They're cute. You're disgusting. - No, spiders down here. - Just please check again, please. - Here spidey, spidey, spidey. No, we're good. - Would you mind just checking the closet, please? - It's an ironing board. We're not in danger. Look at all this stuff. - Do you see anything? - Yeah, I see lots of things. Look at this. - What? What is that? - It's a Ouija board. - Really. - Sarah is gonna love this. - Look what the Frankie found. - What? - A Ouija board and tarot cards. - What. - Yeah. - We should play. I played it before. It was creepy but fun. - Me too. Maybe we can find out who used to live here. - I'm game. - You're always game. - Hey, guys. - How are you feeling? - A lot better actually. I feel like I slept forever. - Good. - Good. - Well, Frankie's been exploring. She found a Ouija board. - Yeah. We're gonna have some fun from the dark side. - Really. So, how do you play? What are the rules? - It's easy you just put your fingers on the pointer. You can't push it. You have to let it move by itself. We ask questions, and we see if the spirit wants to connect with us. - It's just for fun, right? - Of course. Let's see what happens. - We need a pen and paper. - Turn the lights off, Sarah, just candles. - You guys ready? - Yeah. - Nothing's happening. What's supposed to happen? - Be patient. - Nothing might happen, Victoria. No spirits wanna come out and play. Maybe they've all gone out to party. - Well, why are we doing it then? Okay, who's moving this. - It's kind of freaky. - Who are you talking to? What is that, I? - Uh-huh. - O. R. - I don't wanna do this anymore. - Victoria. It's okay. We're all in this, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Vic. Who are you? - Who's me? - I'm in the lake. - Oh, my god. - Oh, my god. - Okay, who's moving it? - I'm not. Are you, Sarah? Frankie. - No, I'm not. - Lonely, that's the word. - Lonely, who's lonely. - Shh. Spirit, if you're with us, please tell us. Give us a sign. Victoria, it's okay. - It is not okay there's somebody here. I can feel them. - Victoria, it can't be real. - It is real. Somebody's here I know that they are. - I gotta tell you something. None of this is real. I set this entire thing up. - Set what up? - I filmed this entire thing with cameras. It's for my Ph.D. I'm doing a study on fear, but this has just gone too far. I can't do this anymore. - So all those noises that was all you? - Yeah, I kind of set that all up. I didn't think it would come down to all this. It's weird. - I was really starting to believe all of that. I really was. - I'm sorry. - So you filmed this whole thing. - Just some of it. - Wow. You really are something else. When were you gonna tell us? - After filming, I was gonna ask for your permission to use it. - I wanna see it. Now. - Rachel. - That's so weird. There's a glow around Victoria. - That's just a night vision. - Yeah, it's really spooky though. Look at the Ouija board, guys. There's a glow around that too. - I was feeling something. Okay, I was there was something in the cabin. I mean that's why I was so scared. - I told you I created everything. - No, Sarah, not what I was feeling I know it. - Victoria. - Rachel, I know what I was feeling, okay. - You see what you've done you've totally freaked her out. It's okay, Victoria. We can prove that there's no one here. We'll just go back to the Ouija board and nothing will happen. - What if something does happen? - It won't I promise. See, Vic, nothing. There's nobody here. - I'm so sorry I did all this, Victoria. - Who moved it guys? - I didn't did you, Sarah? - After all this. - Victoria? - No. - Ask the spirit's name, Frankie? - What is your name, spirit? Mary. When did you die, Mary? 1965. Where? - Oh, my god she died here. - Why are you still here? Why are you here? - I don't wanna do this anymore. - Victoria. - I am not gonna do this anymore. - You can't break the circle during a seance. - I'm really scared, okay. - You're safe with us. Nothing's going to happen as long as we're together. Come on. It's okay we're safe together. - Sarah. - The spirit is here. - Sarah, don't shit us. This is getting weird. - She is all around me. There is nobody to be scared of. Nothing at all. It's so calm. She likes us being here. She needs us. She needs us. I can show you. Mary, wants us to connect with her again. - Sarah, are you crazy, no. - Rachel. Think of a color. - Yeah, alright. - Mary, what is the color? Green. Were you thinking of green? - That's weird how did you know that? - I didn't it was Mary. - Yeah, right everyone thinks of green. - No, I choose red. - Frankie, it could be anything. Okay, think of a flower. - Okay. - What is the flower. - Rose. - Hey, that's so freaky. I thought of a tulip, but then I had to change my mind like I had no choice. - Mary, wants to play tarot. - I don't know how to play tarot. - I'll show you. Just think of a card as I do this. - It's too fast I can't see one. - Try again. Got one. What is the card? - What card did you pick, Victoria? - The Fool. - Okay, where is Mary? - Here. She's here. - Sarah. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - You keep going somewhere else. I don't know what's going on. - We've had enough of this board. Okay, everyone needs to just chill out and relax. Okay, come on enough. - Frankie. I'm getting a really strong message from Mary. She wants you to regress to go back to when you were four or five years old. You were sitting at a table by a warm fire. In front of you is a sheet of white paper and some crayons. Mary, wants you to draw a picture. - That's crazy. What? - Just draw what you feel is safe. - I don't know understand. How did you know? - The same way you did. This picture wasn't ours, Frankie, it's Mary's. She's here with us. - Is she trying to tell us something? - It's of the cabin. - Sarah. What really happened back there? - What do you think happened? - I don't know. I saw the picture so strong in my mind, so vivid. It's like someone got into my head. - Someone did. - Is anyone hungry? Oh, my god I am stuffed. - I can eat more. - Really. - No. - Seriously does anyone want anymore? - No, I'm full. - No, that was so good though. Where did you learn to cook like that? - From my mom. - Yeah, the Italian bit of her I guess. - The pasta was so good. - That was bad right, bad Italian, sorry. - Guys we shouldn't have done it. - What? - The Ouija board. - Victoria, come on. Do you not realize that we have just connected with someone from the other side. - I'm not sorry I did it. - Yeah, neither am I. Think about it nothing bad has happened. - Yeah, I don't know why you're so riled up about it. - What if she's still here with us, Mary? - Should we find out? - No. - Shall we? - Come on. - No thank you. - Suit yourself. - Fine. I'll get the lights. - Well, don't do it without me. - Is there anybody here with us? Show yourself. - How did she die? - Ask her. - Mary, how did you die? Drowned. She drowned. Did you drown in the lake? Was it an accident? - Who else is here, Mary? - Heis? Some sort of name maybe. - No. He is it's two words. Maybe she means the one who killed her. - Shit. - Is that what you mean, Mary? - G. O. Go. What does she mean go like like we should go or she's going or what? - Maybe this isn't real, okay. Maybe we wanted to believe it, made it up. We're scaring each other so much. Just we need to stop. - Or maybe it is real, and maybe what she says about him is true and he's here. - You okay? - I'm fine. - Frankie. Frankie, are you alright? - Yeah, I'm fine. It was just a nightmare. - Victoria, are you okay? Oh, my god. Why don't I go get some hot chocolate. Frankie. - It's okay. Look at me it was a dream, okay. - Rachel. Rachel, what's wrong. Oh. What is happening? - Guys. - What? - There's a light on in the outhouse. - Why is she going outside by herself? - I don't know. - It's Frankie probably one of her dumb jokes. - Yeah, but what if it isn't, Sarah. Frankie. - Frankie. Frankie, where are you? - Great the flashlight's broken. You know what Frankie if this is a joke it's not funny. Frankie. Frankie. She's nowhere to be found. We need to get help. - How are we supposed to do that? - Keep it together, Victoria. We need to be strong. - Frankie, may come back. Maybe she just she got lost. - Between the cabin and the outhouse, Victoria. I don't think so. - Well, where is she then? - I don't know. - Guys, there's no point in scaring each other. - This all started when we played that fucking Ouija board. We should've never done it. Your stupid filming, Sarah all for your little project. - Don't be like that okay it's not Sarah's fault. - Well, then who's fault is it? - It's nobody's fault. - Well, she organized all of this. It was her crap idea. - I'm so sorry, Rachel. I didn't think anything like this would happen. - We need to contact her. - How are we gonna do that. We don't know where she is? - I'm talking about Mary. - You cannot be serious. - I have never been more serious. This is really, really bad karma. But she's our best bet to find Frankie. Are you with us? - I don't think I can do this, okay. - Okay. Spirit, are you with us? Show us a sign. Is this, Mary? Do you know where Frankie is? - Where is she? - He's here? Who is here, Mary? Sarah. Sarah. - Lonely. What happened? - Your voice went all funny. You sounded different? - Don't you remember anything? - We were contacting Mary, right? - We did she was here. - We just need to get out of here, okay. We just need to go to the car, and we need to drive and get some help. - If we make it to the main road, we'll get a signal. - Sarah, are you okay to drive? - No, she doesn't look good I'll drive. - Oh, my god. - Sarah, come on. Take the candle, Victoria. Come on get in. - Rachel, pressed button. - It's not working. - Stop you're gonna flood the engine. - It's not gonna start. - My god what are we gonna do. - Okay, we can try walking to the main road, or we go back inside and we wait until it's light. - It's too dark outside, guys. We're gonna get lost. We have to go back in there, Rachel. - Okay, you're right. Victoria, we have to be strong, okay. Do you hear me? - Guys, we closed the door. - Maybe the wind blew it open. - What are you doing come on. - Frankie.
