Alma ! Alma, stop! It is very good. You play it very well. I have been preparing for this competition for ten years. I work 20 hours a week. I want it to be perfect. It's perfect. Absolutely perfect. Alma, it's time. OK, Cassandra. It's yours. JFK airport, please. Hello, Joe. Hi my dear. You know, your grandfather didn't do anything like everyone else. It is still true today. He wanted a "green funeral". Return as a tree. At the foot of the magic tree. Yes. I loved him so much. He loved you too, darling. Mom and dad. And now, Grandpa. I only had him. Don't you forget your old godfather? I have something for you. I'll be right back. Hi, Nutty! It's been a while ! - You remember him ? - Yes. Your grandfather recorded a message for you. So... Do you want to go back to New York? Non. Perfect. Stay here. Impossible. I have my competition. I have to work. Are you sure ? Do you want me to stay here tonight? You're kidding ? Nothing can happen to me here. It's true. Well... I'm coming by tomorrow to take you to the airport. My blue fairy. Do you remember the squirrel I gave you when did you get your first bad grade? You didn't get it because you were wrong, but because you said what you thought for the first time. And it was wonderful! I wish you lived like this. 'Cause you're the only one who knows what is good for you. Every time you doubt take a good look at this squirrel right in the nose and think about me. I was about to forget ! I have a new friend recently. A female wolf. She's not tamed, of course. But she is not afraid. She comes near the house. Looked ! Here it is. I love you, my blue fairy. I will always be there. I love you too. We're almost there, boy! S.O.S. ! Emergency landing requested! It's 34. You are the king of trackers! OK, let's calm down! 34 is over there. Let's go. Ah, the 34! Come on, Eli! Charles ! I'm bad luck. I shouldn't have come with you. My mom always says I'm a city dweller... Eli ! You have something ? Over there. I will put him to sleep. She is magnificent. Charles ! It's a wild Canis Nix ! She's in the water now. Bravo ! What is rule #1? Don't touch yourself when you have the gun. Watch her. I'll see how we can cross the lake. Do not be afraid. What happened to you ? Can you smell Grandpa? This wolf is a treasure. We lost her. This species is disappearing. It was unexpected! I know all that. Keep looking. What are you doing here ? It is private property. We're looking for a wolf. Did you do this to him? Well done ! Do you know where she is? Are you tracking her? I don't like hunters. We are not hunters. I am a great scientist. Vivisection? Experimentation ? No ! The Canis Nix, the snow wolf, is in the process of... I understand nothing. I want to reintroduce these wolves into the wild. And for that, you capture them? It's absurd ! You do not understand ? If you want your kids to see a wolf... I want you to leave my island. It is private property. They are welcoming here. What are you doing here ? It's a nightmare. I couldn't reach you. Yes, I suspected that. I forgot to leave this for you yesterday. There is no network here. You have to go to the lake, but it captures badly. You must have been scared with that crash. Can't you imagine... Come see. What is happening ? What is that ? A grandpa's friend. She was freaked out, she brought her little one here. There is also the lion cub. What ? He was on the plane that crashed. Damn it ! No wonder she chose this house. Come on, come on. You can't stay here with these animals. Call the rangers. It's their job. They must already be looking for this lion cub. Shit, here they are! I have to go. Do you see this woman? We had a story and... I've heard enough, Casanova. I will come back. Hello, Miss de Ranquel. Hello. Thank you. Our condolences. Rangers Simpson and Richardson. We won't be long. It's nothing. You won't believe me. We know. The plane crash. It's awful. The pilot is injured, but he will recover. Do not worry. - We are taking care of it. - Except for the animal. There was a lion on board, intended for a circus. What ? Does he belong to a circus? How are you, miss? We haven't found him. If you see something, thank you for calling us. The circus needs to prove it's dead. Have a good day. - Thank you. - Sorry for the inconvenience. Don't hesitate to call. Look at this. You ate well ? That's it, you're friends. Are you sure you like the circus? Animal abuse in circuses How awful. My God ! Hello Princess. You were supposed to come see me. I was busy... solve some problems. I came to tell you some news. What ? I will stay here until my competition. Fantastic. I am very happy. Bye. Alma. And the animals? What ? Animals. The problem is solved ? Yes. Perfect. Everything is fine. - Its good. - OKAY. Take care of yourself. See you later. I have to go back there. Hi baby. You still want to play! You like ? Hey, friends. My enchanted cabin, built by grandfather, with his magic tree. Lets' go. Come. Attention ! I go. You have everything you need. I open this window for you? Very well. Well, I'm going to leave. No nonsense. I count on you. I'm only leaving for two days. Do not worry about me. You don't care, okay. Bye. Hello everybody. The big day is finally here. You have worked very hard for years for this contest. But only the best three have a chance of being chosen by the Los Angeles Philharmonic. It's up to you to make your dream come true. Give your best. And do not forget : I believe in each of you. Good luck. Sabrina, you're the first. Alma. Did you touch her? You got it! You got it. That's crazy ! Where have you been hiding all this time, beauty? We did it. We did it ! The last student chosen by the Los Angeles Philharmonic is... Ranquel's Soul. Congratulation. Hello. This is Alma de Ranquel. I'm calling about the lion cub. Well done, Soul! It was fantastic. Thank you. Do you have any news from the South African shelter? He doesn't take cubs anymore? You assured me he would take it. What am I going to do with him? What did you do ? Where is your mother? Hey! Him ! Where did you go? Come back ! Come back ! I need you. I can't take care of them alone. It wasn't supposed to be like this. You had to go with your mother. And you, you would have been happy in a beautiful place. How will I do ? I know she left. Most... I will not abandon you. Come on. In bed. Go on. Very well. Careful, don't drop it. Good night. Be very wise. I love you. For God Sake ! No ! I can explain everything to you. The lion is at a circus. circus animals, it was grandfather's fight. And ? I would have wanted it all my life. And the wolf? The wolf has not returned. I waited for her, but she disappeared. And so, I had to take care of them. You lied to me. I believed you for months. - You would never have accepted. - Of course not ! So I was right. I came to find out about your competition. I got it. I was offered to join the Philharmonic. Truly ? I am very proud of you. I refused. What ? - It was your dream. - No. It was that of others. They opened my eyes. You can't do that. I am responsible for you. Not at all ! I have been managing myself for eight years. You act like a spoiled little girl. And you, like a stubborn adult. Touch. What will you do ? I know this is not the ideal place for them. But they are inseparable. I am looking for the right solution. I haven't found it yet. So in the meantime... You are quite a number, you know. I love you princess. Me too. Hi you ! I have to find you some names. Do you need a name? I've found ! What are you doing ? Lets go ! Leo and Lupus? No. Arpeggio and Allegro? No more. It's my garden. My carrots! Come here. How about "Too cute" and "Too cute"? Or... "Future" and... "For all time" ? Non. Hey, don't go! "Madness" and... "I had no choice". "Happy" and... "How is it going to end?" Very well. You will be Mozart. And you... Dreamer. Sure. I picked the right name, it seems. It is not like that. Looked. D flat. Joe, put the sign out front. Beware of the dog Private island - Do not enter Health ! Sweet Jesus ! They're going to tear me to pieces. OK, I'm closing the door. They came across a boar, it wasn't pretty to see. In the bedroom. It's not funny. I manage. You manage nothing at all. If they attacked someone? One. I want you to make me a promise. Okay, princess? I can no longer come here to watch over you... I'm scared for you. I want you to keep me informed daily. Everyday, Alma. You promise me ? OK. Perfect. Alma for Joe. Yours. I get you five out of five. Yours. What a ridiculous thing, Joe. Yours. Every day, Alma! Yours. - I love you. - Me too. Ended. It's okay, Joe. Are you sure ? They are going to lunch. I'll call you back tomorrow. Ended. Mozart ! Dreamer! At table ! Mozart ! Dreamer! Mom, I want these flowers! It is not possible. It is a private island. But look, we are alone! Please. OK. Yes ! Look at the yellow flower over there. A last. Come on, we have to go. No ! Stop! Mozart, Dreamer, come back! Stop! Alma, this is Joe. Yours. Alma, this is Joe. Yours. Damn, answer me! You promised me, every day. Everyday ! It's not normal. Alma ! Where did she go? It's Joe. What do you have ? Ysea is Joe. Go to hell ! You can die at the bottom of a well. I sent you flowers. I'd rather poke my head in a termite nest rather than helping you. Listen. Your troubles fill me up of joy ! Hello ? Come here with the police. Alma is hurt. We're east of the house. On arrive. She has a concussion. Will she make it? It will take time, but she has a good chance. She can thank these animals. It's impossible to survive, motionless at this temperature. Without them, she would be dead. Thank you. You're welcome. I was so scared, when I saw you lying there. I had to call the police. Without it, the rescuers could not have approached you. I beg your pardon. Good morning ! I am Eli Harmon, of the Snow Wolves Sanctuary. They called me. You have a wolf for me. Yes, come with me. Ysae! M. Harmon. Ysae Richardson. Follow me. Come see what we found. Here it is. Hi friend. You really are a handsome wolf. I will take you to a place you will love. Well ? Well... it's a snow wolf. Can I hug you? Come this way. Thank you. The circus people are there. Go see them, I'll take care of sir. Very well. Rapha ! Are you coming to see your lion? Yes. Gilles, can you open? Thank you. Go help Jack. Well... there you are ! Yes, there is no doubt. We've identified the chip. We nicknamed him Monster. Monster ? It fits her well. Well, Monster. You don't seem very obedient. Hey, my son! Don't approach. You are not trained yet. We'll take care of that. There are papers to sign, and it's yours. Very well. Be wise. Are you coming, my son? I'll join you right away. You look stressed. Me, when I'm stressed, I'm listening to music. That would help you, do you think? Looks like you're like me. Isn't that beautiful? Is that his mother? Yes it's her ! She goes present it to the pack. And to the ladies. Ten more babies, Charles. Ten babies, Charles, and we can reintroduce them in nature, where they should be. Apart from this one. This girl was raising him like a dog-dog. He's more imprinted than a Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Come to see ! He is magnificent ! A real lion! How about our new attraction? Welcome to the family, Monster. Hello Princess. I was afraid you would never wake up. Where are they ? Are they injured? No, I do not think so. Sorry, princess, but they had to put them to sleep and take them away. Where ? They must be at the Conservation Center. It's my fault. Not at all. You have to think of yourself. Hi friend. You look sad. Want some music? I can ? Everything will be alright. Everything will be alright. Rapha ! Hi Dad. Turn that off. Yes. Well, Monster. Where will I test you. On the track, together. Come here, you'll help me. First, let's relax him. Are you going to drug him? I will calm him down. Rapha, I'm just going to calm him down. Everyone does that. We have to, with the lions. Tomorrow, their claws will be removed. It will make it less dangerous. But for now, safety comes first. Dad, I... Come here, Monster. To tame a wild animal, there is no other way. My boy, you have to break it. We only get there through fear. Come here. You are the only one who knows what is good for you. Every time you doubt take a good look at this squirrel right in the nose and think about me. Joe ? I want to know where they are. I leave the hospital. Pick me up in ten minutes. Yes. OK. Bye. Hello. Is it possible to find out where two animals are? A two-year-old wolf, and a... And a lion. Yes, we know. And no, It is not possible. Not a word, dirty traitor. You are liable to a colossal fine for unlawful detention of a representative of an endangered species, a snow wolf. Where are they ? You have no rights over them. They are in a place where they are protected. In a zoo? A circus ? A laboratory ? You are not protecting animals. You dominate them, you control them, you exploit them. I saw two babies calling for help. Where are you going? Do you think I'm crazy? Non. You're wonderful. Joe. I don't know where Dreamer is. But if Mozart is a snow wolf, I have an idea. I think I know where he is. Come ! Entry prohibited Wild animals Hello ? Hello. I'm looking for a young wolf. A snow wolf. I wondered if he wouldn't at your house ? Aren't you the madwoman who raised him? If it's me. I will explain one thing to you. It's a wolf. A savage animal. He must live in freedom in a pack. How is he ? Like a wolf. That is to say ? I love chatting with you, but I have work. He's doing just fine without you. He rediscovers his wild nature. Bye. What did he say ? If he lives in freedom, he must be happy. I read that somewhere. And my Dreamer? I'll look for it in all the circuses. Monster ! How are you bro ? Ladies and gentlemen, children! Welcome to the circus! But you don't come to see me. Non ! No, I know it well. You came to see my new friend ! Yes ! Are you sure? Yes ! I can not hear you ! Well, in this case, say his name. Monster. Stronger ! Here it is ! Do you have a lion in this circus? No, we don't have a lion here. Sorry. I'm looking for a young lion. We only have lion cubs here. He is tall. His name is Dreamer. He managed to escape through that door. How did he do ? This wolf is a genius. New hypothesis: why did he leave? There could be a bunch of reasons. He felt something, he was afraid... No, Charlie! I do not believe it. I've worked with wolves for ten years. Never has a wolf escaped from the sanctuary. He is looking for something. Listen, Eli, figuring out why he left isn't the priority. We have to find him as soon as possible. Don't forget that he grew up with human beings. He will jump on the first comer instead of fleeing like other wolves. Which makes it potentially very dangerous. If we understand why he left, we may know where he is. He may be looking for his mom. His mom ! Maybe that's it! OK, Eli, it was just a joke. You know, when you say something to make people laugh. Hello. Eli here, of the wolf sanctuary. I hope you're doing well. We have a little problem. My wolf escaped. He didn't live in freedom? Sort of. My colleague has a slightly crazy idea he might be looking for you. He's not looking for me. Maybe so. He is looking for Dreamer. Dreamer? His brother. Wait... There were several Cubs? No. Dreamer is a lion. Dreamer is a lion. Thanks for your help ! She is crazy. Of course she's crazy, Eli, come on! Pulled yourself together ! I will go to the last place where we received GPS data. I'll let you know. I do not believe it ! Are we complete? Yes. Good... Let's go tell Monster that. Give me the whip. Back off, Monster. Back ! You're usually much more obedient. Papa ! How are you, dad? It was what ? I dunno. The bastard! Give me my rifle. And syringes. Sorry, dad. When did you give him his pills? - Two days ago, I think. - Two days. Do you think or are you sure? I'm sure. Two days. This means that soon, he will be very tired. We'll catch him in the woods. What if he hurt someone? You have to notify the police. We don't warn the cops, they would take it from us. Okay. Go to the truck, quickly. Get to work, everyone! We won't be long. - New ? - Yes. I am at the place of the signal, the wolf was there. Near a circus that has a number, le "Monster Show". So what ? Well, this "Monster" is a lion. It's not true. It's not over. Spit it out. From what I see, there is a cage, but... it is empty. We have entered the fourth dimension. Would she be right? The madwoman is not mad. Goodbye thanks. Yes. What if you were right? Yes ? To be honest, science may need you. I do not understand. My wolf escaped. My wolf escaped and... it is a valuable specimen. You seem to care about him. You do not understand ! The Canis Nix is an endangered species. Its taxonomy is perhaps a bit controversial. For some it is an incertae sedis, but it's wrong. Before the arrival of the Europeans, the Cherokees were already making a species apart, they called them the wa'ya. Anyway, I did a lot of calculations. from which it appears that you are the only one who can find it. You came this far to tell me that I can recover your wolf? Yes that's it. Screw you. Why did I come here? You are absolutely crazy! I will find my wolf on my own. The pilot is gone! What am I going to do ? Take my boat. I understand better now why you live on an island, all alone ! I am not alone ! You are never alone in nature. Half the Animals of North America live in this forest. Three billion land and water birds breed here, nearly 300 species. With ducks, loons, grebes, coots and seagulls. And of course there is also all the others ! bison, elk, moose, grizzlies, black bears... There's more gasoline. What do I do ? You don't know how to swim? The water must be at 10 degrees! Don't be a wimp. Hey, Alma! I am sorry. Me too. She fed them. They are linked by love, not by blood. She took care of them. One day, she didn't come back. I took over. I came here to tell you: you were right. And I was wrong. We followed the wolf. We spotted him near a circus. This circus has a lion that got away. So we think they are together. I came to tell you. Thank you for warning me. We need each other. - I don't need you. - Oh yes ? Well, your wolf is wearing my GPS collar. What ? Do you know where he is? I know in which direction they are going. I received their position, but I no longer have internet. We know they come from there. The last signal was there. If they move in a straight line, they're heading here. I want them to be free, but to know where they are, that they are safe... It would really please me. They go home. Alma... Sorry to have captured the wolf. Go take a shower. I'll take care of the boat. I present to you Eli. I filled it up this time. If you hurt her, I will be happy to watch you suffer. Thanks, Joe! Fear hangs over the city. The police are mobilized to capture two animals that escaped, a wolf and a lion. It is recommended to stay at home, except in an emergency. They head for the forest. You over there. Dad, please. There you are. - How are you ? - Yes. - Was it him at the circus? - I dunno. Shit ! He wears a necklace. Take it off him and get rid of it. Quickly. The dose is too strong, it will kill him. Good... Hurry up, we have to get out of here. I sprained my ankle. With that, you'll be fine. In ten minutes, you can run. Let's go! Go on. Come on, dad. We'll look for Monster later. I need to take care of my ankle. What can they do there? - How are you ? - Yes. Is this Coke good? Is your ankle better? Not really. Did you see how that wolf jumped on me? It seems unreal. Hello. Where is my wolf? Our wolf. Your wolf? Sorry, I don't understand. The GPS signal is very accurate. Oh, is that it? We found him by the side of the road. And my son, he loves electronics, so... Take it back, if it's yours. Health. Pardon. What got into you? We could be in big trouble! I know but... I'm going to the bathroom. What ? Wait ! Can I help you. You know something ? I know where he is. And your father ? I do not care. Come, I'll take you there. Come. Are you sure it was here? They were almost home. The police will find them before we do. When he was at the circus, the only thing that calmed him down, it was classical music. The plan. Music ? Brilliant. Let's go back to the car! Quick ! Music ? Monster ! Come here ! Stop ! Stop. It's him ! You have nothing. Close your window. Where is Mozart? I will follow him. We are waiting for you here. We stand guard here. You know where he is, huh? He's in the cabin? Let's go. Dreamer, where is your brother? Mozart ? You came to take refuge in my cabin. I found Mozart! You are a real coward. It's just a lion. OKAY. If he comes this way, it's every man for himself. I found it ! They are fine. We walk back. The police are close by. They have orders, they will kill them. You're going nowhere with my lion! Calm down! I located your phone. Come on, it's over. Non. Rapha... What's the matter with you ? One! I do not want. I can not. I want more ! Everything I do it's for your future. Don't say it's for me. I will never be like you. I hate what you do to animals. I hate this life! I thought you were happy. I didn't want to disappoint you. I tried, dad. Forgive me. Mom thought like me. It is not serious. It's nothing. I love you. I'll fix this, okay? Let's go. We will never have time. Tell Joe: the magic tree. He will understand. Spread out. This way. Take. Open your eyes wide. Let's go. We are heading towards the lake. To the lake ! One. On suit la berge. Forward! Hurry up! Its good. Where's Joe? Go on ! OK ! We're going to have to swim. Go on ! I know you're afraid of the water, but we have to go. Otherwise, they will kill you. Don't sacrifice yourself for us. Don't be afraid, we're going together. Everything will be alright. Dreamer, come. Where you go ? Come back. Target in sight. One. Joe... Where is the lion? He won't come back. Before I begin, I would like to say that despite the love I have for Mozart and Dreamer, and their beautiful lesson of tolerance, my heart is heavy. If they love each other like brothers, it's that humans have deprived them of their freedom. They managed to make a living for themselves, despite everything, and have found happiness, in spite of ourselves. Wild, a wolf and a lion have nothing to do with each other. I don't know if I was right to keep them. I did it because... it was the only way to protect them. I love them, I want them to be safe, but they shouldn't be here. I would like to dedicate this concert to Mozart and Rêveur. I hope this incredible friendship between a wolf and a feline will shine... like the first snowflake in an azure sky. And that she will teach us to defend the right of animals to freedom.
