(INDISTINCT CHATTER) Anyone here? My name is Erwin Griswold. I am the dean of this place. Welcome to Harvard Law School. Take a moment to look around you. In this room, there are Rhodes and Fulbright Scholars, Phi Beta Kappa members, student body presidents, and a Harvard football team captain. (INDISTINCT CHATTER, LAUGHING) - Together... - (CHATTER STOPS) you will become lawyers. This is a privilege you share. It is also a responsibility you accept. Consider... what does it mean to be a Harvard man? A Harvard man is intelligent, of course, but he is also tenacious. He is a leader devoted to the rule of law. He is mindful of his country, loyal to tradition, and he is respectful and protective of our institutions. - (BABY CRYING) - MARTIN: "The net operating loss deductions "by the year shall be computed as of Subsection A of this section, applied to such tax review..."

It was Charles's son who hurt his hand. - Electrocution burn. - And at what point does the case turn, Mr. Fitzpatrick? McGee promised to fix the hand by performing a skin graft, but McGee wasn't very familiar with the procedure, and the results weren't quite what he planned. Question already, Mrs.... - Ginsburg. - Correction, Professor Brown. McGee did not simply promise to fix George Hawkins' hand. He promised, quote, "a 100% good hand." - That's the same thing. - BROWN: Is it? What say you, Mrs. Ginsburg? It is not. Words matter. McGee grafted skin from Hawkins' chest. Not only did this fail to fix the scarring, he had chest hair growing on his palm. Proving that a hand with a burn is worth two with a bush. (LAUGHTER) The court denied Hawkins' damages. Hawkins did get damages... the court said - he could have... - If I may finish. Hawkins was denied damages for pain and suffering. The New Hampshire Supreme Court ruled he was entitled to damages only based on the contract being fulfilled. So if Dr. McGee had set realistic expectations instead of making grand promises, Hawkins' award likely would have been less.

Ten years ago, Dorothy Kenyon asked a question: If the law differentiates on the basis of sex, then how will women and men ever become equals? And the Supreme Court answered: They won't.

INTERN: They can have sex without it. (MEN LAUGHING) - It's because of taxes. - Mm-hmm. - Ah. That's true. After the war, Sweden passed a law that said married couples will now file joint income tax returns. However, unlike the United States, they weren't given any of the benefits from it. So married Swedes were finding themselves in the uncomfortable position of now being in a higher tax bracket. - (CHUCKLES): Oh, really? - So they got divorced. MARTIN: Of course, they were still living together. So the Swedish government then passes a new law that says, all right, married couples who get divorced but continue to live together, for tax purposes, will be considered still married. So they did what anyone would do. They add a second entrance to their home with a nice wall that goes right down the middle, with doors for... (CLICKS TONGUE) easy access. - (MEN LAUGHING) - "All right, fine," says the Swedish government, "new law." Once married, now divorced couples living in a two-income household that is subdivided would, again, for tax purposes, be considered living together, and therefore... INTERN: Therefore still married. - MARTIN: Now he's got it. - (LAUGHTER) And this went on for decades. All the while, a whole generation of Swedes simply skirted the issue by never getting married in the first place. Thank you. Speaking of, have you all met my lovely wife, Ruth? The moral of this story is that in their attempt to raise revenue, the Swedish government ruined all those young men's best hope at happiness. - (LAUGHTER) - Exactly.

She's the New York lawyer I told you about. Mrs. Moritz, hello. I thought she would be bigger. - I... (CHUCKLES) - Uh, y-you can have a seat. Uh, here. Here you go. Do you want your magnifier? - Yeah, please. Yeah. - Okay. CHARLES: There you go. All right. - You want a drink? - Uh-huh. I-I see you were a drum major. I was a twirler. That was a thousand years ago. Mr. Moritz, about your case... I don't have a case. Four lawyers told me so. And that judge... Tietjens... he basically called me a tax cheat. Are you? I never cheated at anything in my life. "Tasmanian egg-layer." Eight letters. Not now, Mom. Tell me in your own words, why did you hire a nurse? If you've never cared for an ailing parent... I have. Then you know. Between the dressing and the bathing and the toilet, it's not a task for one person, especially if you have a day job. If it wasn't for Cleeta, uh, I'd have to put Mom in a home. So you deducted Cleeta's salary on your taxes. The judge said the tax code was clear. Caretaker's deduction was available to all women, but only to men who had wives who were incapacitated or dead - or were divorced. - And you've never been married? - No. - The men who wrote that law couldn't even fathom that a bachelor, choosing to take care of a parent at home, might exist. "Tasmanian egg-layer," - second letter: "L." - Mom, - I'll help you in a little bit. - How about "platypus"? Ah! Ah. I'm a salesman, Mrs. Ginsburg, and I know when I'm being sold. With due respect, you have $296 at issue. I'm not here for the money. We'd represent your appeal pro bono if you'll let us. So... the judge was wrong? Mr. Moritz... the law is wrong. Thank you. I was hungry. If it's not for the money... why are you here? The 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution says all people must be treated equally under the law. Yet there are... I don't know how many laws like the caregiver deduction that say, in effect, women stay home, men go to work, and that it should stay that way forever. I want to convince the federal courts that those laws are unconstitutional. How do you do that? One case at a time. Starting with yours. So I'm a guinea pig? No, sir. You're the man marching out ahead of the band, leading the way. (CHUCKLES QUIETLY) Just like that drum major you used to be. - (HORNS HONKING) - I've invested a lot of my own reputation to building up your career, and now you're on track to be the youngest partner in the history of the firm. And you want to risk that for some cockamamy case? Tom, I'm contractually obligated to ask to take outside work, and I'm asking, but... Okay, for God sakes, you're traipsing into this for what? So your wife can feel like a real lawyer? She is a real lawyer, Tom. You want to support Ruth, tell her the truth. - Which is? - The case is unwinnable. Congress can write whatever taxes it wants. That's not open to constitutional attack. Or maybe you just say that because no one's been able to successfully do it before. Oh, Marty. Fine. Try, but... when you lose and you embarrass our firm, just be ready for your career to come crashing back to earth. Okay, noted, noted. And thank you, Tom. - Thank you. Thank you. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. No! Murder can never be condoned, - least of all by a lawyer. - It's called justice. Yeah, what's just to you may not be just to me - or to someone else. - You know what I'm talking about. - MARTIN: Hello, family unit. - And would it kill you to admit that maybe I actually did something right? - This is an "A" paper. - Yeah, of course it is. You're a beautiful writer. It just needs more work. Please tell me you aren't going 15 rounds over To Kill a Mockingbird. Daddy, can you please tell Mom that Atticus Finch can be a role model. He covers up Bob Ewell's murder. He's a terrible lawyer. - Why? 'Cause you say so? - No, not me. Canon 1 of the American Bar Association's Model Code - of Responsibility. - What are you talking about?! It's called legal ethics. Well, you'd do exactly the same thing if you actually had a heart. (DOOR CLOSES) I don't know where she gets her stubbornness. Can't imagine. So, how was your day? "History discloses that woman "has always been dependent upon man. "Like children, she needs special care. This justifies a difference in legislation..." - Muller v. Oregon, the law of the land. - Wow. Or Bradwell v. Illinois. "The destiny of woman is the benign offices "of wife and mother. This is the law of the Creator." I'm writing this brief and citing the same cases with the exact same precedents as-as everyone before us. Marty, if this is what we go in with, we're gonna lose. ("QUESTION" BY THE MOODY BLUES PLAYING) Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. I got it. I got it.

I want her to stop rubbing it in everyone's face all the time. Grandma Celia died when Mom was about your age. But up until her dying breath, they would read together, debate ideas together... and she taught your mom to question everything. She's not trying to bully you, Jane. She just doesn't want you to feel small. She wants to give you what her mom taught her. That's how she... shows her heart. Hmm? ♪ Is she okay? She'll be fine. This is stupid. You're the one who said I'm supposed to be in school. If you're gonna write about great American lawyers, you may as well meet one. (KEYS JINGLING) You ladies look lost. Well, spit it out. Miss Kenyon, w-we're here to see you. I tried to make an appointment... Well, here I am. I don't have all day. It's about Gwendolyn Hoyt. In that case, I have no interest in talking to either one of you. I'm-I'm arguing a case. Sex discrimination violates the Equal Protection principle. Equal Protection was coined to grant equality to the Negro, a task at which it has dismally failed. What makes you think women would fare any better? Please, if we could just talk for... You want to know how I blew it... is that it? What I'd do differently? Why? You think you can change the country? You should look to her generation. They're taking to the streets, demanding change, like we did when we fought for the vote. Our mistake was thinking we'd won. We started asking, "please," as if civil rights were sweets to be handed out by judges. Protests are important, but changing the culture means nothing if the law doesn't change. As a lawyer, you must believe that. Let me guess. You're a professor, aren't you? (CHUCKLES): Yeah. Ton of knowledge and no smarts. - Mom, we should go. - You want advice? Here it is. Tell your client she won't find equality in a courtroom. My client's name is Charles Moritz. That's cute. He hired a nurse to take care of his mother, but... he was denied a caregiver deduction on his taxes. He's never been married. You found a bachelor taking care of his mother at home. The judges will be repulsed by him. Feeling anything is a start. What did you say your name was? Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Well... sorry, Professor Ginsburg. Maybe someday. But the country isn't ready. Change minds first, then change the law. If you'll excuse me, the mayor's decided to rename the neighborhood. So now a developer is kicking 30 families out of the building he abandoned ten years ago. SoHo. Who ever heard of such a ridiculous thing? (THUNDER RUMBLING) JANE: I know she's your personal hero and all, - but she's kind of a bitch. - RUTH: No, she's formidable. Dorothy Kenyon has been fighting for women's rights and civil rights and labor rights her entire career. She didn't always win, but she made damn sure she was taken seriously. JANE: She didn't help you. - What are you gonna do now? - (MAN WOLF WHISTLES) It's the right cause, it's the right client, but... women have been losing the same argument for over a century. Well... just because you lost a hundred years before you started is no reason not to try to win. Jane, that was very wise. You know who said it first? Atticus Finch. (CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT CLANKING) Quick. (MAN WOLF WHISTLES) MAN: Hey, looking good, ladies! - (MAN LAUGHS) - Just ignore them. Hey, we'll keep you warm if you're getting wet. Oh, yeah? Real nice! Do you kiss your mother with that mouth, asshole? - Oh, whoa. - Whoa! Mom, you can't let boys talk to you like that. Taxi! Mom, come on. You're getting soaked. Look at you, Jane. You're a liberated, fearless young woman. 20 years ago, you couldn't have been who you are today. Dorothy Kenyon's wrong... the... the times have already changed. - (HORN HONKS) - DRIVER: You coming or what? Yeah, yeah, we're coming. RUTH: It's what Professor Freund said at Harvard. "A court ought not be affected by the weather of the day, but will be by the climate of the era." Okay, so we're not going back and refighting old cases? No, we're arguing that the precedents - should no longer apply. - Right. But, Ruth, Freund was talking about Brown v. the Board of Education. That's a once-in-a-generation case. Yeah, and we're the next generation. ♪ RUTH: "Equal Protection applies "to all persons. A class in which men and women share full membership." WOMAN: "A divorced man counts the same - as a widower." - You're saying that this guy could have married his nurse, got divorced the next day, and then he'd be eligible for the tax deduction? That's totally nuts. All right, our client is a man. We cannot lose sight of that, because men are also harmed by this stereotype. That little boys are told they can't be nurses, they can't be teachers, they can't be secretaries. Or cook dinner for their families. Exactly. We're counting on you, too. ...wholly irrational distinction between single sons and daughters. Any tax preparer may have an invalid parent... MARTIN: Any tax preparer may have an ailing parent, - even an unmarried man. - ...unalterable biological traits of birth over which the... MARTIN: The principles of American democracy should apply to men and women equally. RUTH: ...arbitrary and equal treatment described by the Constitution. MARTIN: The law shouldn't reward or penalize taxpayers for their sex. ♪ Section 214 draws a line solely on the basis of sex. (TYPEWRITER BELL DINGS) ♪ Professor Ginsburg, I finished typing the brief. (GASPS SOFTLY) You're a saint, Millicent. May I make an observation? It's just... when I was typing it up, jumping out all over the brief was... well... sex. - Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex. - Oh. (LAUGHS) - Oh. - It reeks of hormones and back seats, and... you know how men are. Maybe you should try a less distracting word. Maybe... "gender." You realize that means... That's no problem. I'm happy to type it again. Thanks. MEL: Guessing doesn't do us any good... I need to know how many people were turned away from the polls. Yeah, the affiliate still hasn't sent the list. Well, then call Brian Tanner. Remind him that we're on the same team. Tell him if he doesn't start acting like it, I'm gonna fly to Wisconsin and personally rip his throat out myself. Melvin. Didn't your mother ever teach you to clean your room? Miss Kenyon. Time for your annual dusting-off already? (BOTH CHUCKLE) In 1776, Abigail Adams wrote her husband a letter. "As you write this new constitution," she said, "remember the ladies." You know what that bastard went ahead and did? Well, I can guess. "Idaho Statesman." You need a hobby. These poor people. Sally and Cecil Reed, divorced. Their son committed suicide. Both parents want to administer his estate. In Idaho, the law says, in this situation, males must be preferred to females. Why? 'Cause men are better at math. And the Idaho Supreme Court just said that is perfectly legal. Dorothy... I've got student protestors in jail in California. I got schools in Mississippi that still refuse to desegregate. I... You're a sissy. The Board threatened to can you because you stood up for draft dodgers, and you've had your tail between your legs ever since. That-that-that is not... We don't have the resources to take this on. I've seen you stand up to the might of government with sling and stone for what you know to be right. And, kid, I loved you for it. They're not gonna fire you, Mel. The Board's a bunch of tired old fools. They don't have the nerve to do it. (SIGHS) I should know. I'm one of 'em. John Adams forgot the ladies. And it's time the ACLU got back in the fight. - Okay. - Good. Now, here's where you start. It's a case headed to the Tenth Circuit. It's a professor out of Rutgers. Smart cookie. Ruth. But nowhere does the Constitution say the federal government must treat people equally. What did the court say about that, Mrs. Parker? That the Due Process Clause implies that equal protection applies to the federal government as well. Can you cite the case? MEL: Bolling v. Sharpe. 347 U.S. 497. Uh, decided in conjunction with Brown v. Board of Education, 1954. Bolling desegregated all Washington D.C.'s public schools. Chief Justice Warren, writing for the court. How about it, teach? Do I get an "A"? (MEL CHUCKLES) Well played, sending that newspaper and the brief to Kenyon. I thought she might have advice. Cut the shit. Don't ever do that to me again. What do you think of the brief? It's a compelling argument. Brilliantly reasoned. More women than ever are working now. And why not? We have preschools, we have washing machines, cheap contraceptives... Yeah, times have changed. There's a glaring problem, though. In the unlikely event that you actually win this thing, what's the remedy? The court takes away the caregiver deduction for everybody, including working mothers. - Then you've done more harm than good. - No. Do you remember Justice Harlan's opinion last June in Welsh v. United States? Yeah. He said laws could be extended when doing so would be closer to the legislature's intent than overturning would be. Yeah, we're adding one more section to the brief. Urging the court to extend the law to include Charlie as well as everyone else. All right. The ACLU is prepared to put their name on your brief. - We appreciate your support. - (CHUCKLES): Stop. I still say I'd rather be a woman in this country than a black man or a... socialist or a religious minority. Now, let's talk about you taking on Reed v. Reed. - Oh. Stop. No. - Well... all men in Idaho are better at math? Ruth, I gave you one case. That's all you get. The Moritz argument works just as well for a female client. And Reed's a state supreme court case, which means the U.S. Supreme Court - must hear the appeal. - I-I told you, I don't want another 50-year battle. Call Sally Reed's lawyer, Mel. If I were you, I would worry about my own case. And I expect to see your remedy arguments before they go to the Tenth Circuit. And I want to be there when you practice your oral arguments. We're doing a moot court. No. It's not negotiable. When? Soon as we get the government's response brief. BOZARTH: Where did these people go to law school? You can't make a constitutional challenge to the tax laws, can you? And who's ever heard of gender discrimination? It's a stretch. These folks are running at hell with a bucket of water. Case law is filled with challenges that could not be made... till they were. I'm putting Murphy on writing our response brief. - With due respect, Mr. Brown... - Not personal, Bozarth. But if we're not careful, this appeal could cast a... cloud of unconstitutionality over every federal law that differentiates between men and women. I need someone more seasoned on this. Could you get me the solicitor general, please? I pulled the file. I deserve the chance. Murphy's a weak sister. I know how to win this case, sir. Better than Murphy. Better than anyone. You need me on this appeal. This is Brown. I need to see him. Okay. Tell me. Gender equality as a civil right? When everyone's aggrieved and everyone's a victim. It's what the ACLU does: divide the country into smaller and smaller subgroups. - Ginsburg. Cancer, right? - Mm-hmm. - And the wife, very demanding. - But smart. Ten years. Ten years I fought to enroll women at Harvard Law. The faculty, the university, my wife warned me against it. Now I'm solicitor general, it comes back to haunt me. Erwin, we could settle. Martin Ginsburg was one of my best students, a practical young man... we can call him, tell him we'll give the man his money and go our separate ways. No. No. We settle now, it's open season. Let's put this idea of gender discrimination to bed once and for all. They handed us a winnable case. Then we'll win it. You think he's up to it? Oh, Mr. Bozarth is a fine litigator. Tell him your idea. We list the laws. What laws? All of them. Every federal law that treats men and women differently. We show the court exactly what kind of can of worms these folks are trying to open. But, son, the last anyone checked, the U.S. Code was 20,000 pages long. Who's going to read it? You? I can get it done, sir. I just need an introduction. To whom? The Secretary of Defense. ♪ BROWN: These computers will find what we're looking for? Yes, sir. In just a few days. Without any human beings actually reading the laws. What a horrifying age. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Ruth Bader Ginsburg? Delivery from the Department of Justice. Oh. JANE: Can someone pass me Title XXXIII? Get this. There's a law that we're not allowed to fly military cargo planes. It says here that we're not allowed - to work in mines. - Why would you want to? Well, that's not the point. We should be allowed. You really think you can change all those laws? - MARTY (CALLS): Kiki? - That's the plan. Curtain's up in 45 minutes. Might be a novel experience to get there before it starts for a change. Please tell me that you are... dressed. Hi. What are you doing? Government's brief came. And look who else is on it. I knew Griswold was trying to get Brown over to the DOJ. Looks like that worked. - How's it look? - Check out Appendix E. JANE: It's every federal law that discriminates on the basis of sex. We're looking them all up. There must be hundreds. - Good God. - RUTH: Hmm. BROWN: Well, you're convinced Daugherty will see it our way. Well, based on reading all of his opinions, yes. And so will Holloway. But the final judge... Doyle... well, he's going to be a tougher nut to crack. - That's unacceptable. - We need a unanimous decision out of the Tenth Circuit, James. We don't want so-called gender discrimination finding its way to the Supreme Court. Yes, sir, I understand that. What-what makes this judge so difficult? Well, ma'am, he's a civil rights crusader. Two years ago, he ordered Denver to start busing black students to white schools. There were protests, arson, demands for him to quit the bench. But even after someone threw a bomb at his house, Doyle wouldn't budge. GRISWOLD: In that case, he was enforcing the law. The Ginsburgs are asking him to make law. We need to drive home the difference. Paint the judges a picture of the America that will exist if they rule the wrong way. Children running home from school to find no one's there. Mommy's at the office or on a factory floor. Man and woman vie for the same job, she can work for less. What is a man without a paycheck to take care of his family? BROWN: What woman would want him? Wages would go down. Divorce rates would soar. The very fabric of our society would begin to unravel. Exactly. The other side wants this to be about the Equal Protection principle. GRISWOLD: The judges are deciding what kind of country, what kind of society they want their children and grandchildren to grow up in. You make sure the court sees what's at stake is the American family. JAMES: Whoa! Cool! (DOORBELL RINGS) Uh, Mom? - Can I be on the jury? - No, there is no jury in federal appeals court, no witnesses, no evidence. Just you and the judges. - Gerry! - Hello. - Hello. - (CHUCKLES) How are you? - You remember Jane. - JANE: Hi. Jane, my old professor, Gerald Gunther. Come on in. Look at you. All grown up. - Hello, James. - Hi. - What do you think of our courtroom? - Huh. Well, all that's missing is Justice holding her scales. So, who did Mel find to be the third judge? - Pauli Murray. - So he's not making it easy for you, huh? - Who's Pauli Murray? - Thurgood Marshall himself called Pauli's writings the "Bible of the civil rights movement." Gerry. I come bearing your gavel. (CHUCKLES) (GAVEL BANGING) GUNTHER: Counsel for the appellant, you may proceed. - (GAVEL POUNDS) - Again. Your Honors, and may it please the court. Section 214 of the tax code covers employed single women who care for their dependents, but excludes Charles Moritz, a-a bachelor, providing the same care. My wife stays home to raise our children. Are you saying she's oppressed? - No, Judge, but as a man, you may not... - MEL: No, no, no. Stop, stop. Stop. Never make it about the judge. (CHUCKLING): You don't think the judge knows he's a man? No, I don't want her to put him on the defensive - about it, though. - In Brown, we put it out there without apology: this is wrong. Yeah, no offense, but Ruth doesn't exactly have Thurgood Marshall's, uh... Balls? - Gravitas. - Should I... should I start again? Unless you think you won the case already. - GUNTHER: Whenever you're ready. - (CLEARS THROAT) Uh, Your Honors, and may it please the court. Section 214 of the tax code covers employed single women who care for their dependents, but excludes Charles Moritz, a bachelor, providing the same care. There is no rational basis, because this... Wh-Why is it not rational? Men go out; women stay home. It's been the way of things for thousands of years. H-Historical justification was also used to legitimize the separation of the races. - Now, classification... - Are you saying race and gender are the same? (FOOD CRUNCHING) W-Well... both are... unalterable biological traits. This nation struggles to give blacks fair representation throughout society. - Can you pass that? - And you're saying that, if we decide in your client's favor, we're committing ourselves to moving towards half of our, I don't know, firemen being women, half our nurses being men? But why shouldn't men be nurses? And if-if women want - to fight fires, then... - What about pilots? Yeah, again, if women choose to take on these roles... - Judges? - Why not? CEOs? Generals? What about garbagemen? You want to be a garbageman? Well, and if-if men want to be teachers or raise children... - Oh, come on. - Percentages aren't the point. - Wrong. - People should be able to pursue their passions. Wrong, wrong. You're screwing it up, Ruth! Have you... have you read the appendix - attached to their brief? - You're making the wrong case. These are laws written by men who think we are privileged to be excused from men's obligations. But it is not a privilege, it is a cage, and these laws are the bars! So, that's it? You're gonna take them all on at the same time? (SIGHS) You asked the questions. Well, it doesn't mean you have to fucking answer them, Ruth. You're making the government's case for them. Look, you either make this case about one man, or you lose. 'Cause to the judges, you're not talking about women in the abstract. You're talking about their wives, at home, you know, baking briskets. You braise a brisket. You don't bake it. - Perhaps that's enough, Mel. - No. I don't think it is, Gerry. Look, when you were a kid, you were pretty and you were smart as a whip, but you're coming across as this bitter, unlikable shrew that I don't even recognize. And if that's who shows up in Denver, you will blow it. And would it kill you to smile? That's your advice? Just... ignore the judges and smile? Pâté is the best I've ever tasted. You could evade. Should women be firefighters? "With all due respect, Your Honor, "I haven't considered it, because my client isn't a firefighter." Or you can redirect. "With respect, Judge, this case is not about firefighters. "It's about taxpayers, and there's nothing inherently masculine about paying taxes." Or crack a joke. "Your Honor, anyone who's raised a child "couldn't possibly be intimidated by a burning building." - (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) - And then bring them back to your case. Marty, you should do the oral arguments. No, no, no. Ruth is the expert on gender law. At least half this case is tax. Uh, the most important thing is that Charles Moritz wins. I said no, Mel. Drop it. They could split the time. Martin goes first, focuses the argument on tax. Then Ruth steps in, talks about gender. - Pauli, here you go. - Thank you. - Gerry, this is yours. - Mel. Mel. (WHISPERS): There is no aspect of the law at which Ruth Ginsburg can be bested. I don't know how things work at the ACLU, but if anyone at my firm couldn't see that, they would be fired. Objection noted, counselor. - She's still arguing half. - This is her... Listen, she's written a revolutionary argument, but brief writing is an academic's job. Okay? Oral arguments require a lawyer who can command a judge's respect. A real appellate lawyer. (CLICKS TONGUE TWICE) Oh, what a team you're gonna be. It was a good experience. I think that was a very productive exercise. I have to go to a fund-raiser. Pauli, Gerry, you want to split a cab downtown? - Sure. - Sure. - Good team, huh? - It's good to see you, Gerry. Thank you for coming. - Bye-bye. - Bye. - Bye. Great to see you. (DOOR OPENS) RUTH: Bye. You have such a light touch. It... it's just effortless for you, - isn't it? - Uh... Mel was goading you. He was trying to make you feel overwhelmed. That's... Of course he was. He's a relentless prick. But it doesn't change the fact - that I'm not ready. - It's not your fault. - You've never done this before. - Well, is that what I'm supposed to tell Charlie when I blow it in court? Do you want Theories in Public Taxation with you in Denver? - Who needs a tax reference when you have Marty? - (CHUCKLES) - (PHONE RINGING) - Did you pack the, uh... the Kirk v. Commission brief? Yes. Rutgers Law. It's Mel Wulf for you. (WHISPERS): Just tell him I'm not here. I'm sorry, Mr.... He says it's urgent. - Yeah. - What was so important? I'm excited to work with you. Ah-ah. Shh, shh. Ah-ah. No. I understand. She just walked in. And to you, too. Okay. Ruth Ginsburg, Allen Derr. How do you do? The Supreme Court just announced they're gonna hear Reed v. Reed on appeal from the Idaho Supreme Court. - That's fantastic. - ALLEN: Mrs. Reed is very excited for the opportunity. Uh, Allen's Sally Reed's lawyer. So... is the ACLU gonna help? Mm, you told me it was the right thing to do, right? ALLEN: Mel says that no one knows this area of the law better than you. You're our secret weapon, Ruth. So... y-you want me... in the Supreme Court? I, uh... uh... I-I told Allen you'd be eager to help him write his brief. Oh. Well... basically, take the Moritz brief and swap around the pronouns. - Isn't that right? - Well, it's a... little more involved than that. - Joking. - (CHUCKLES) All right, let's start right away. Allen, uh, enjoy the city. You should catch a show - while you're here. - Oh, well, thank you. - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh, uh, Kiki and I have some stuff to discuss. Yes, of course. I'll-I'll get out of your way. Uh, it was a pleasure meeting you, Ruth. Or Kiki. Uh... Mel. - Oh. Um, I... - Ah. Don't forget that. Mustn't forget that, yeah. What a schmuck. Let me argue Reed in court. - Oh, give me a break. - I have no less experience than Allen Derr in federal court. - You have zero experience. - If you're gonna use - my arguments... - He's been Sally Reed's lawyer for three years; she trusts him. She wouldn't even let me argue the case. Now, listen to me for a second... we have someone else to discuss. Ernie Brown called this morning. In light of Reed going to the Supreme Court, the government wants to settle the Moritz case for a dollar. Reed ups the profile of our case. Th-They're getting nervous. I told them you'd be in D.C. on Monday to sign the paperwork. Why would you say that? Charlie won't want to settle. Well, convince him. (LAUGHS): I will not. First, you took half the argument away from me... Nobody took anything away from you, Ruth. You weren't robbed in the middle of the night. All right? I was giving you this opportunity - for the good of the cause. - You think you gave this to me? In fact, I did. And get your emotions in check. You first. Allen is gonna be arguing in the Supreme Court that times have changed. We can't afford the Tenth Circuit saying that they haven't. Nothing would strengthen the argument more - than the appeals court deciding for Charlie. - Yes, that would be very nice, but here in the real world, - with working lawyers... - You think I can't be persuasive? Oh, I've never been more certain about anything in my life, Ruth. You don't get to tell me when to quit. You couldn't even make it through moot court without embarrassing yourself. You will lose, Ruth. And when you do, you will set the women's movement back ten years. More. We are dodging a bullet here. Are you the only one that can't see that? These are Allen's briefs from the previous appeals. Tie them into the framework of the Moritz brief. I'll review it when you're done. It's a Supreme Court brief. I can assign it to someone else if that's what you'd prefer. Oh, and-and, Ruth. Uh, the sooner you call Charlie, the better. RUTH: I had this idea. What's that? Well, it doesn't matter now. Tell me. We could have taken Appendix E from the government's brief, that entire comprehensive list of laws that differentiates between the sexes, and... and turn it into our own hit list. We could have started a special project at the ACLU to go after those laws one by one, in the legislature, in the courts, until women and men were genuinely equal under the law.

Not in my experience. As Mr. Moritz's lawyer, I'm... I'm ethically bound to convey him the offer. So would you like help taking apart your life's work, or... is that something you'd rather do by yourself? I... I know that this case, that... ...that I disrupted our lives, and...

What about everyone else? When you came to see me, you said... Charlie, the settlement is only for you. - No one else can benefit. - (SIGHS) But could we win? Well... we could, and... and the impact would last generations. But the ACLU feels... it's best if you take the offer. (SIGHS) But you're my lawyer, Ruth.

I'm Mr. Ginsburg. - Nice to meet you, Charles. - My pleasure. Well, here we are. All rise. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is now in session. Judges Doyle, Holloway and Daugherty presiding. HOLLOWAY: Be seated. You have a century of case law on your side. Just do your job. HOLLOWAY: The first case is docket number 71-1127. Charles Moritz v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Each side will have 30 minutes to present. When two minutes remain, the court clerk will rise to give warning; when your time is up, he will sit. Counsel for the appellant, Mr. Ginsburg, you may proceed. Good morning, Your Honors, and may it please the court. Today we are going to demonstrate that Section 214 of the U.S. tax code unfairly discriminates against our client, Mr. Charles Moritz, because he is a man. HOLLOWAY: Congress assumed that a caregiver is most likely a woman. Is that so unreasonable? If the law says all caregivers are entitled to a deduction, and if the writers, in the back of their mind, thought, well, this will only apply to women, then that would be an assumption. But they went farther than that, Judge. They explicitly list who qualifies - as a caregiver. - As is their prerogative. Yes, but, Judge, I doubt that you would turn the same blind eye if it said only white caregivers. Oh, that's hardly the same thing. Respectfully, we disagree. I'm gonna turn it over to my cocounsel, who will discuss the constitutional questions... You're telling us that race and gender are the same? My cocounsel... Yes, yes, we'll get to her in a minute. But I'd appreciate an answer to my question. In order for a law to discriminate, it must distinguish between groups arbitrarily. Is that correct? My cocounsel will... Mr. Ginsburg. I have asked you. It must be arbitrary. Yes. And in this case, we believe the law is. Mr. Moritz is a man who never married. That may make him less likely to have childcare responsibilities, but not parent care responsibilities. - And had he been a woman... - DOYLE: And to your mind, classifications of this kind must always be discriminatory? There's some help. He's asking him to make a broad categorical claim. MARTIN: I can't speak to always, Judge. I can only speak to this case and this man. Very well. Thank you. Then speak of him. Again, the only distinction between our client, Mr. Moritz, and any other caregiver, in Judge Daugherty's words, is arbitrary. Thank you, and I cede the remainder of my time to my cocounsel. (GALLERY MURMURING QUIETLY) (MAN COUGHS) (ELECTRONIC FEEDBACK) Your Honors... Whenever you're ready, Mrs. Ginsburg. Your Honors, and may it please the court. Section 214 denies Mr. Moritz a caregiver tax deduction available to similarly situated women... Yes, yes, we've... we've been through all that. (CHUCKLES) Uh, Mrs. Ginsburg, you are aware that the government has three coequal branches? - Mrs. Ginsburg? - Yes, of course, Your Honor. And that it is the Congress's role to write law? Your Honor, I understand how government works. (QUIETLY): Take it easy, Ruth. Well, uh, sometimes a law, even a good law, even a law that is legal under the Constitution, may not be good for every individual it affects. I have a question. If I understand correctly, you're concerned about men and women being pigeonholed into certain roles based on gender. Yes, that's correct. - Because... - Excuse me. Uh, that wasn't my question. It strikes me that the caregiver deduction does the opposite. It helps women be able to work outside the home. Isn't that a good thing? But the law assumes it must be the woman who is supposed to be at home in the first place. Well, that is the case in every family I know. So it's the assumption that's the problem. Then when can a law differentiate on the basis of sex? Never? When the classification rationally relates to the law. Keeping women out of combat, for example. I'm not sure whether I agree with that example... Oh, so you think women belong on the front lines now, too? RUTH: No, that's not what... Gender, like race, is a biological, unalterable trait. There is nothing that women are inherently better at than men, nor vice versa. Growing a beard? - (LAUGHTER) - Well, that's... - Lactation. - (LAUGHTER) No thinking person could possibly imagine that Charles Moritz's gender relates - to his abilit... - (ELECTRONIC FEEDBACK) DOYLE: Why can't we, Mrs. Ginsburg? In most households, aren't women the primary caregivers? Aren't men the breadwinners? Aren't they? Most households, yes, Your Honor. Doesn't that reality suggest that that's the natural order of things? Respectfully, Your Honors, I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal. Not sure I followed that. H-How are we doing? (DESCENDING WHISTLE) (IMITATES SOFT EXPLOSION) It's okay. It's not over yet. ♪ HOLLOWAY: Mr. Bozarth for the appellee, - you may proceed. - Don't let them forget what this case is really about. You'll be fine. Ah, Bozarth. - The, uh, master of citations. - (BOZARTH CLEARS THROAT) That's what my family calls me, too, Judge. (LIGHT LAUGHTER) Your Honors, and may it please the court. Congress created this tax deduction to help caregivers go out and work. Caregivers. Folks that, if they weren't working, would stay home. Now, are we meant to believe that this man would have the skill or even the caregiver's instinct to do that? DOYLE: Why can't we believe that? Why does an unwed woman have that instinct but not an unwed man? Or a widower, for that matter? BOZARTH: Well, respectfully, Judge Doyle, a widower doesn't choose to be a caregiver. It's thrust upon them. And as for women, it doesn't take a legal treatise to prove what a hundred thousand years of human history has made indelibly clear. DOYLE: And Congress can write the tax code to enforce this natural law? Congress can write whatever tax code it wants. All I'm saying, Judge, is that given the natural order of things, this man, Mr. Moritz, hasn't suffered as a result. But the country will suffer if the court doesn't find for the appellee. Your Honors, I am certain there isn't a man among us who wouldn't try to ease his wife's burdens. So I don't see how we can judge negatively the members of Congress who would do the same. And I'm not alone in that. There is a long and honorable tradition in the courts of upholding laws like this one. I, for one, would rather see my government err on the side of caring too much... ...of trying too hard to help the ladies of this country, rather than to be indifferent to their unique burdens. Now, maybe Mr. Moritz disagrees. Or maybe he just doesn't like paying taxes. (QUIET SCOFFING) Personally, I don't believe that. I believe that Charles Moritz is a victim. Not of his government, but of the lawyers who have used his case to achieve their own ends. Radical social change. (GALLERY MURMURING) We rest our case on our briefs and argument, and ask that the court uphold the tax court's decision. Thank you. ♪ Counsel for the appellant, you have four minutes for rebuttal. Counsel for the appellant? Counselor. "Radical social change." When I was in law school, there was no women's bathroom. (LAUGHTER) It's amazing to me now that we never complained. Not because we were timid; we were just astounded to be in law school at all. A hundred years ago, Myra Bradwell wanted to be a lawyer. She had fulfilled the requirements for the Illinois bar, but she wasn't allowed to practice because she was a woman. An injustice she asked the Supreme Court to correct. Illinois was so confident of victory, they didn't even send a lawyer to argue their side. They were right. She lost. That was the first time someone went to court to challenge his or her prescribed gender role. A hundred years ago. "Radical... social... change." 65 years ago, when women in Oregon wanted to work overtime and make more money, as men could, the court looked to the precedent in Bradwell and said no. So then there were two precedents. Then three, then four, and on and on, and you can draw a direct line from Myra Bradwell to Gwendolyn Hoyt, told ten years ago she was not entitled to a jury of her peers. That is the legacy the government asks you to uphold today. You are being urged to protect the culture and traditions and morality of an America that no longer exists. A generation ago, my students would have been arrested for indecency for wearing the clothes that they do. - (LAUGHTER) - 65 years ago, it would have been unimaginable that my daughter would aspire to a career. And a hundred years ago... I would not have the right to stand before you. There are 178 laws that differentiate on the basis of sex. Count them. The government did the favor of compiling them for you. And while you're at it... I urge you to read them. They're obstacles to our children's aspirations. You're asking us to overturn nearly a century of precedent. I'm asking you to set a new precedent, as courts have done before when the law is outdated. But in those cases, the courts had a clear constitutional handle. The word "woman" does not appear even once in the U.S. Constitution. Nor does the word "freedom," Your Honor. ♪ Go on... Professor Ginsburg. The principal purpose of Section 214 is not to protect women nor to discriminate against men. It is to provide caregivers the opportunity to work outside the home. Therefore, as the Supreme Court did in Levy v. Louisiana, this court should fix the law most in line with the legislative intent. Extend the deduction to never-married men. Help all caregivers equally. Charles Moritz was well-raised to be the sort of man we should all hope our sons will become. Charlie deserves our admiration. Not only has he taken on the burden of caring for his very strong-willed mother when no one would expect it of him, but in doing so, he has surpassed the limitations the rest of us and our laws seek to force upon him. We're not asking you to change the country. That's already happened without any court's permission. We're asking you to protect the right of the country to change. Our sons and daughters are barred by law from opportunities based on assumptions about their abilities. How will they ever disprove these assumptions if laws like Section 214 are allowed to stand? We all must take these laws on, one by one, for as long as it takes, for their sakes. You have the power to set the precedent that will get us started. You can right this wrong. ♪ We rest our case on our briefs and argument, and ask... that you reverse the tax court's decision. ♪ ♪ Kiki!

JUDGE 4: ...Edwards against Healy and others. ♪ CHIEF JUSTICE: Mrs. Ginsburg. RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court. Amicus views this case as kin to Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. The sex criterion stigmatizes when it is used to limit hours of work for women only. It assumes that all women are preoccupied with home and children. These distinctions have a common effect. They help keep woman in her place, a place inferior to that occupied by men. The law must stop using sex as a shorthand for functional description. The judgment enjoins enforcement of the statute insofar as it discriminates on the basis of sex. ...practical effect, laws of this quality help to keep women not on a pedestal, but in a cage.
