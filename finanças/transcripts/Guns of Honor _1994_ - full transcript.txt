[Horse whinnies] [Coyote howling] [Coyote howling] [Cattle lowing] They look good, Jack. I'd say $2 a head is a fair price. I was hoping for $3. But $2 and a half will cover what I owe. $2 and a half, it's a deal. Deal. [Chuckles] It looks like you got a kill, Jack. We'd better take a look. [Cattle lowing] [Hawks screech] [Flies buzzing] [Hawks screeching] [Buzzing continues] Poison weed. Damn. Damn. Dirty bastards. Who would do such a thing? That's my problem. I'll sort this out. I'm late with my taxes. That's all. The money for the herd will take care of it. Martha, Sam. We've had enough, frieda. We're leaving. Come with US, please. No. Get some help, frieda. You can't stand up to malick on your own. [Clicks teeth] [Saw grinding] Yo, come on. [Barking] I don't suppose you have any idea who's poisoning my cattle. Your manners haven't improved with age, Jack. Just answer the question. I don't know what you're talking about. Jack. I'd go take a look at the north range if I was you, Jeb. This fool has dumped poison weed in the water hole. Poison weed! Tring made a-- tring. Someone should tell tring cows ain't particular where they drink. We can't afford to lose cattle any more than Jack Newman can. He made a mistake. Making mistakes is getting to be a habit of his. Anyone can make a mistake, little brother. You pay him to collect taxes, big brother. Tell him to keep off the range and out of my way. Just what I don't need. So what's wrong? Ask your brother. He'll know. What? Just leave it, Jeb. Damn. I'm heading out by Newman's place. [Horse whinnies] [Frieda] Whoa. I got your supplies. [Tapping morse code] [Man] Sam henslow finally up and quit, Mr. Newman. They set fire to his barn. I know. Yeah, seems like everybody's giving up. Can't say as though I blame him, though. Times is hard enough without messing with the troopers. What about Jeb? Jeb ain't here. Wouldn't expect you to quit, though. He ain't quitting. Just selling a few steers. [Laughing] You're behind with your taxes, miss la salle. The boss sent US to collect the money you owe him. Owe him? Did we stop pretending then, tring? If you were as smart as you make out, you'd be on a horse out of here. You threatening me? Why should I do that? I wired dusty to come and get 'em. You didn't have to do that. I could have delivered. No, it's all right. He's a lot younger than you are. He'll bring the cash with him. Here. Let me help you. Let me go! Get her off the street. [Frieda screaming] [Barking] Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! [Men chuckling] Let me go! She's kinda pretty for such a skinny girl. Don't! [Barking] Get their guns, miss. Into your wagon. Get out of town, frieda. [Dog growling] [Barking] You just made a big mistake, you and your friend. Good move, malick. Subtle. Boris! [Whistles] The henslow deeds will take about a week. The rest is over to you, partner. Get the guns, stone. [Stone] Yeah, sure. Wasn't for me, he'd still be sitting on his fat ass with a fancy title and spit all in his pocket. Who was that with Newman? Don't know. Clean yourself up. Thank you. Been a long time since I helped rescue such a pretty young lady. Careful, Mr. Newman. Tring's not gonna forget what you and your friend just did. I know that, frieda, but don't you fret. It's not the first time me and old devil here have crossed swords with the likes of malick or his henchmen. No, but usually the army is not on the other side. Be careful, miss. I'd stay out of town for awhile if I was you. It was about to get real nasty back there. Now you listen to me for a minute, Jack. I'm due over at fort Davis by the end of the week. Now you could tell me to butt out if you want to, but it seems to me like you could really use some help around here. I've already wired dusty-- "expect trouble." Now don't be stubborn, Jack. Use him. You said yourself, good hands are hard to come by. Maybe you're right. The war is supposed to be over. The war is over. We just never counted on maggots like malick. Don't worry. This madness won't last forever. It's lasted too long already. [Man] How many do you figure we lost? Most of these are Newman's. [Cattle lowing] One of these days your brother's gonna go too far. You'd better get him to ease off those ranchers. We'll bed down here. [Boris barking] [Horses whinnying] Easy, Boris, easy. [Gunfire continues] What the hell? [Screams] It's coming from the Newman place. You bastard. [Gunshot] [Groans] [Gunshot] [Screams] You should have minded your own business, old man. [Laughing] [Gunshot] Jack! Jack, you in here? [Coughing] Jeb! Jack! Get out of there! [Coughing] Jeb, hurry! Get out of there. There's no turning back now. Not for anyone. [Jeb] Damn. [Rooster crows] Stay back there, ebb. Anything you say, boss. [Chuckles] The old ticker of mine couldn't take it anyhow. Ebb! You'd better have a good reason for being here. Lady, you're good enough reason for any man. Cut it out, kid. Señorita. Ebb! I got 'em covered. Give the lady her towel, Miguel. Go ahead. Sorry, ma'am. My name's fog, dusty fog. We're looking for the Newman ranch. You friends of his? Yes, sir. He's dead. You'd better step down and let the lady finish her bath. [People chattering] [Chattering stops] [Piano playing] Whiskey. [Coin clinks on bar] Got one of those for me? You get back here, Lucille. That saddle bum got nothing you can use. The young lady's made her choice. Well, maybe Jim and sly can help her change it, gringo. [Groans] Anybody else want to try? What the hell's going on here? Relax, friend. There's no need for anyone else to get hurt. Have a drink. You just cost me three good men. Well, I guess they weren't that good. You could be right. The name is malick. Passing through? Maybe. Looking for work? Where the hell do you think you're going? To let the young lady earn her dollar. Any objections? Drop it, stone. [Girl laughing] We could use a man like him. Pity he's a reb. Has anyone told you the war is over? Hire him. Yeah, but-- [Door opens] What the hell happened here? Killing Newman was stupid, but effective. Two more ranchers left yesterday. That leaves the la salle woman holding the rest together. Now, we get rid of her, the rest will follow. I want it wrapped up, tring. Jeb ain't gonna like it. I'll handle my brother. You just follow orders. Fine by me. You handle Jeb. I'll handle Jeb's woman. There ain't nothing of Jeb's you're gonna take, tring. You want, you go ahead and try. And the next time you get the urge to kill, you clear it with me first. Get an eviction order from elden. Make it official. I want her out of here by morning. Jeb pulled him clear, but Jack was dead. What did the sheriff do? What could he do? You know how it is. Malick's a state appointee. The sheriff's the sheriff only as long as malick lets him wear the badge. Malick don't need the law. He's got the troopers. Besides, Ben elden isn't the sort of man to stand up to malick's gunmen. What would it prove if he did? Señorita. He'd only get himself killed. I've told her she should leave. I am not leaving. You don't have to. Well, does she? You were going to help Newman, weren't you? Maybe miss la salle doesn't want our help. I want help all right. But what I don't want is more bloodshed. We've had enough killin'. I don't want any more killin'. Too bad. [Horse whinnies] Into the house. What do you want? Where's Jeb? Jeb's busy. His brother thinks you're a bad influence. You hear what I'm saying, lady? You ain't special no more. And she ain't alone no more, either. A minute ago you could have walked away from here. You just made a big mistake. Like Jack Newman, that kind of mistake? You owe five years back taxes. There was a war. Those taxes are crooked, and you know it. It's just an excuse for you and your leeches to take our land. You know the law. This here... Is an eviction order. So what's it gonna be, lady? A tax for your ranch? It's an eviction order, all right. You acting marshal? No, I ain't the marshal, but around here, I am the law. Says there she's got seven days to pay. So pay. She will... At brant's Ford. That is the county seat, isn't it? And I'd guess this woman would need a receipt now, wouldn't she? And I bet malick is fresh out of receipts. We'll be back. We'll be waiting. Yah! [Horse whinnies] What the hell's Mark doin' here? Whoa! Take a couple of the boys. Let me know when they make a move. Nobody gets through to brant's Ford. Understood? All right. Come! Get a receipt and come right back. Malick's using the law so don't do anything that'll make it easier for him. Yep. Please be careful. Anything for a lady. You ever worry about me? Only when you're behind me. He's not as dumb as he looks. Hup! You know, payin' what you owe ain't gonna stop it. It's just the beginning. You know that, don't you? For some reason, malick wants this land. Don't be fooled by that uniform. Tring's a hired gun. And malick will use him. What do we do? [Ebb sneezes] We take care of our own. Once it's started, there's no quittin'. I won't quit. Come on! We got ourselves some movement. Stone! [Grunts] Get moving! There. [Stone] Oh, shit. He's headin' for brant's Ford. You tell tring we're goin' after him. Come on, let's go! I'll take care of it, Miguel. What do you want, Jeb? What's going on here? Who's he? That's none of your business. [Sighs] Look...can we talk? Alone. [Uncocks gun] So what'd they tell you? That you hired some guns. They would. Things are gettin' out of hand, frieda. Don't tell me. Tell your brother. You can't just hire guns. Someone's gonna get hurt. Someone already did get hurt, remember? Jack Newman died. I remember. Frieda. I wanna get out of this place. Let's leave, now, you and me. Right now. We don't have to stick around in this mess. I don't believe this. It's not our problem. Of course it's our problem! This is my land! Those people are our friends. What is the matter with you? We can't just walk away. We've got to do something. You don't understand. I do. No, no, you don't. You think you know my brother. You don't know the half of it. I can't do anything, frieda. 'Cause if I do, there's only one way it'll end. And I won't kill him. Jeb, i-- get rid of the gunmen. Jeb-- I can't. Your brother's backed me into a corner. What would have happened this morning if I'd been on my own? What am I to do the next time tring attacks me in the street? The bastard wouldn't dare. No, he wouldn't. Not unless he had your brother's permission to. Where are you goin'? To see tring. Tring's not the problem. Damn. [Horse whinnies] Howdy, gents. You lookin' for me? Well... Seems to me like you all alone. Hmm? [Screams] [Grunts] I am now. [Indistinct chatter] Hyah! Come on. Looks like Jeb has missed his luck again. [Cowboys laugh] Tring! [Grunts] Ahh! Lay another hand on her, tring, I'll kill you! Ow! [Groans] What the hell are you lookin' at? [Tring coughs] Things got a little out of hand in town. That's all. Bull! Tring's out of control. And you know it. Collecting taxes is a tough job, Jeb. But if people owe, they gotta pay. Tring's a low-life. Who else is gonna do the job? Is tring sinking to your level? Or are you rising to his? If I don't do it, somebody else will. You can't use that against me anymore, Brent! After four years of war, you're not the only cripple in town. In fact, you're one of the lucky ones. You're right. I never meant to use it against you, brother. If-- if I did, I'm sorry. If it means so much to you, I'll try one more time-- try and sort something out with frieda. But I'll tell you, Jeb, if she and her gunmen won't see reason-- Jeb! Horses comin'! Tring, it's stone. Ahh! This one's alive. Bring him here. [Gasps] What the hell happened? The bastard bushwhacked US. It wasn't our fault, Mr. Malick. He's real fast. We didn't stand a chance. Go on, cut 'em down. Telegraph Murphy. Tell him the breed is on his way. Tell him I don't wanna see him back here. [Grunts] Who's Murphy? Military governor over in brant's Ford. He and malick are partners. Malick drives them off, and Murphy grabs their land. And it's all legal. Shouldn't have left it so long. [Gasps] Ahh! Son of a-- Malick wants you. The meeting's over. Now isn't that interesting? Yeah. What would she want with him? We'd better find out. Hadn't we? Hmm. [Laughs] What's goin' on? Change of plan. They're layin' for the kid at brant's Ford. How-- I'll explain later. What are we gonna do? Miguel's gonna borrow some of your horses. He's going to ride and warn them. Will you be all right? Si. What are you waitin' for? Adios, señorita. He makes me laugh but he'll do it. Now, if I could just get US out of town in one piece. [Clicks teeth] Here you go. Whoa. The boss wants to talk. There's noth-- maybe you oughta listen to what he's got to say. Smart. Frieda. Jeb told me you were in town today. Please... Have a seat. Meeting go well? Ask Jeb. He seems to keep you well-informed. Frieda, Brent didn't ask you in here to fight. No? Then why did he? To make you an offer. I'll buy your land. Look, if your taxes aren't paid in five days, you're gonna lose it anyway. Take it. Pay your taxes, start again somewhere else. Get married, move out west. There's plenty of land out west. Never. Will you listen to what Brent's saying? No! No damn yankee's gonna force me off my land. No one's forcing you. So, sheriff, you just gonna stand here and let this happen? Let what happen? All I heard was an offer for property that ain't worth spit. Yeah? There won't be any more ranchers leavin'. No? Then they'll have to pay. Blood or money. It's all the same to me. Whose blood? You know, a man ought to think real hard before he gambles with stakes he can't afford to lose. I tried, little brother. Get out. [Gasps] I told you not to hire a reb. I'm gonna kill that bastard. Not yet. You'll get your chance. Not until I know who they're working for. Frieda sure as hell ain't payin' 'em. Murphy? Spying on me? I really don't think so. Who, then? Somebody who wants what I've got. Newman's friend, maybe. Not a lot of people with money to buy cattle these days, or gunmen. Nobody takes what's mine. Anyone who tries... Is gonna get hurt. Yah! Yah! Come on! Let's go! Yah! [Cowboys laughing] [Woman] Get out of here, you yankee pig! Just leave US alone! Out of he-- whoo-hoo! No! You finished, tring? [Tring laughs] Where should I tie her up for you? Hope you're as fast with that gun of yours as you are with your mouth. Try me. Nobody's payin'. Yet. We've got work to do. Move out. That's a running iron. What's goin' on here? Your brother bought himself a herd. They're Newman's. Not anymore. Newman's dead. Taxes still gotta be paid. Get 'em cheap, did he? Don't know. You don't know. You running this ranch now? No, sir. Just helpin' out. Finish up here, then report back to the ranch. Move out. Come on! Let's go! Hey-hah! Been lookin' for you. Here I was, hopin' for Lucille. You know, that was stupid, Mark. She could have got you both killed. She wasn't exactly subtle. She wasn't exactly bright. No. I thought you was in Mexico. Got tired of chili beans. You know who did this? Tring. How come he's still breathin'? Because there's more to it than just tring. What are you doin' here? Helpin' out. Still playin' the hero, huh? You haven't changed much, either. You sent Miguel out after the kid? Murphy's a yankee military governor. Malick's payin' him to keep his eyes shut. They're makin' a lot of money movin' in on abandoned ranches. Is this what you wanted US to come home to, captain? No. But that's the way it is. Life's hard. Instead of wishing for things we haven't got, it's time to adjust and work towards what's right. What about the sheriff? As near as I could tell, he's just scared. Why? 'Cause I need to know who I can trust. What about you? Which side are you on? I don't take sides anymore. I might stick around here a while. Jack was a friend of mine. Thanks. I'm not doin' this for you Thanks, anyway. Watch yourself. Tring'll put a bullet in your back first chance he gets. Maybe. I'd warn that la salle woman off Jeb, if I were you. He's real messed up. He could jump either way. And if you plan on headin' south, you might find somethi'' a little interesting. Yeah? Be careful. What? That's it? Son of a bitch. Hyup. Hyup. Hyup. Hyah. Damn it, kid! Maybe you'd prefer it if I shot ya? What the hell you doin' here? Mark said you're riding into a trap. The military governor's in brant's Ford. He's tied-up with malick. What am I supposed to do? Dusty said you'd think of something. Yeah, well, I will. Don't look so worried. Kid, when I'm with you, I'm always worried. So how's the fair frieda? Ahh, she-- haven't we got more important things to worry about than women? Not particularly. In fact, you know what I always say. Hey, are you comin, or what? Let's go. Frank. I'm quittin'. I worked for you for a long time, Jeb. I've had enough. I'm a cowhand, not a gunman, and I'm sure as hell no rustler. It's all legal, frank. Being legal don't make it right. I'm not taking sides. Sooner or later, you're gonna have to. What do you want me to do, frank? What do you want, gringo? I said, what do you want? You're dead meat, you gringo bastard! [Groans] Ahh! Kid, where are you going? Trust me, boy. Trust me. No offense, kid, but-- girls. Hi, honey! Look at you, two! I can't believe it! It's so good to see you. You, too. [Laughter] [Girl] Whoo! Man, where have you been? Lookin' for you... Gigi, baby. Hey, hey. What do we have here? Señorita. Fancy you. [Kid] Gigi, baby. [Woman whoops] Lonsie, baby. Melanie, honey! Look who's back in town! Oh, god, you look good! Come with US. My, my, my. It has been a long time. Oh, I've missed you. Oh, yeah? Who's your friend? Who? Your friend. Kid! [Kid] What the hell you doin' down there? I don't think this is exactly what dusty had in mind. Didn't I tell you to trust me, boy? Girls, be gentle with him. He's in love. Come here, you. [Indistinct chatter] [Man] They're attackin' our homes now, Ben. First henslow's farm, then Jack Newman. And now, my place. My wife was alone. It's gone beyond a few high spirits on a Saturday night. What do you want me to do? Tring is army. I got no jurisdiction over army. You know that. We want you to do your job. I am. The best I know how. If I go against tring, you gonna back me? Yeah. Karl? Johnson? What about you Wilson boys? [Man] Got your tongue? Well? Answer him, someone. They have wives and kids, frieda. What do you want? Got you a customer. He do that? No...i did. Found him rustlin' Newman's cattle. Rustlin'? [Man] Why would malick's men be rustlin'? Good question. They were re-branding Newman cattle. My cattle. Your cattle? Wanna see a bill of sale? Is there any point? Release him. I don't think that's a good idea. You don't think it's a good idea? And just who are you? The law. Remember? Not anymore. Tring... It can wait. Judge'll be here next week. This bastard killed one of my boys. I want him locked up. If you draw, a lot of people are gonna die. Give me your gun, son. You got what you wanted. Now back off. You can't lock him up. Killed a man. Self-defense. Then the judge will release you, won't he? That is a stu-- frieda. Man's just doi'' his job. Aren't you, sheriff? That's right. Get a message to old devil: Don't do anything. Sit tight until the kid gets back. Now what the hell are we gonna do? Carry on. Just you and me against malick and tring? Yep. Just like we were before they arrived. Hee-yup! [Sighs] You can't just ride into town when they're waiting for you. I don't intend to. He's coming. He's got two troopers with him. You, uh, wanted to talk to me. No, I wanted to meet you. A man as powerful as you is very attractive. And a good friend. And a good friend. And? And. What's your hurry, big boy? Come here and talk to me. Oh, you are enchanting. Enchanting. Oh! Howdy. Nice and easy. Okay. Okay. The breed. I should have guessed. Ah! I'd watch my mouth if I was you. Easy, kid. You're not in a position to trade insults, señor. My friend, here, is a little... Unpredictable. I hear you were waitin' for me. I, uh-- if you want some advice, do as he says. Bad news? Yeah. Dusty's got some trouble over at barlock. Don't tell me. Malick. If you know what's goin' on, why don't you do something? First off, my job is Indians, not politicians. Second, nobody gives a damn, not anymore. We're not all like the malicks and Murphys, eager to ride roughshod over sore wounds just 'cause we can or there's a profit to be made. But we have our bad apples, just like you. In time, we'll get around to the malicks. Yeah. [Sighs] None of US are proud of the last ten years. No. I'll see you in a couple of months-- 300 head. And a bottle of old bushmills. And a bottle of old bushmills. You watch malick, you hear? He's dangerous. I know. [Muffled] [Frieda] Hya! Hya! Get! [Ebb] Get! [Cowboy] Get on. [Frieda] Move out, boys. Come on. [Frieda] Move out. Come on. Thank you. That it? All except the southern range. Maybe we should leave 'em? No. Jack wouldn't have let US down. They may have gotten away with murder, but I'll be damned if I'll let 'em steal his cattle. Want I should go and get 'em? I'll go. Gettin' pretty late, ebb. Maybe you ought to wait until morning. No, I'll ride on out. I'll camp over, get it done with. See ya at first light. Hyah! Come on. Now what? Now we wait. Whoa! I thought the Texas rangers were disbanded? They were. It was my pa's. You know, you took a big gamble out there. I figure you're a badge, you wouldn't draw on one. How come you brought him in? You'd must have known it'd give malick the edge. Tring's straps. I found 'em at Newman's. Malick's not gonna forget what you did today. But my pa always said, "you don't not do somethin' that's right just because it's unwise." That's what makes a lawman. [Ebb] Damn cows, get on! Looks like we got trouble, old horse. Ebb. Hot day to be movin' these dogs. Takin' 'em back to the bar t? Like you said, it's hot. Old cuss like me oughta be sittin' in the shade. [Chuckles] They're yours. They're Newman's. What are you doin' with double k cattle? Now, look here-- rustlin', ebb? No, sir. Mr. Malick, you ain't got no call to go accusin' me-- rustlin's a hangin' offense, ebb. I ain't rustlin'. Don't. Why'd you do that, ebb? You shouldn't have drawn on US. Now we've got no choice. I ain't rustlin'. Mr. Malick, you know I ain't rustlin'. Y-You know i-- sorry, ebb. Like I said-- nobody's hangin' nobody. We're takin' him in. Go ahead. Take him in. It ain't ebb we're after. [Gun shot] [Horse whinnies] Ooh! Ohh! Enough. Stone, tie him up. I underestimated you. You always do. Take him back to the ranch, stone. Remember, I want him alive. [Gasps] I'm through fooling around. Sweet Jesus. [Chokes] [Frieda] Ebb! Ebb! Ebb! Oh, ebb. What the hell's going on here? Your brother hung ebb. You're crazy. Am I? Brent's got no reason to hang ebb. If you can't convince yourself, you sure as hell can't convince me. Assuming they lynched an old man, what do you reckon your brother and his boys have in mind for me, huh? [Sniffles] They'll pay, ebb. I promise. They'll pay. [Chuckles] Who was the old man with Newman? [Chuckles] [Gasps] [Groans] Ahh! You go ahead and keep that mouth of yours closed as long as you want, son. We ain't in any hurry. [Groans] [Spits] Give me the whip. Give it to me! I'll teach you to get in my way, you bastard! Ahh! Nobody takes what's mine! [Groans] [Grunts] [Groans continue] Enough, Brent! He can't even feel it anymore! Get out of my way! He can't tell you anything if you kill him. [Tring] He's right, Mr. Malick. Get out of here. [Door slams] You had the saloon, the ranch. You didn't need anymore. And you didn't have to kill ebb. "Need anymore." You think this is enough? A saloon in a two-bit town, and a piece of dirt? You don't care, do you? You really don't care who gets hurt, how much misery you cause, just as long as you get what you want. Whole country's tearing itself apart and all the war meant to you was a chance to make money! Wrong. Not just a chance. War's the jackpot. You bastard. Don't push it, Jeb. You gonna kill me too? [Horse whinnies] The wire says the breed gave Murphy the slip. He's on his way back with a receipt for those taxes. Damn the receipt! I want 'em dead. All of 'em! [Door slams] [Thunder] [Muffled yells] Quiet. [Whispering] What the hell are you doing here? Jeb, they killed him. It's all my fault. I sent him after Newman's cattle. It's all right. It's not your fault. It was mine. Mine, maybe. It's not yours. [Coughing] Oh, my god. Help me get him down. If we don't get him to a doctor, he's gonna die. If you don't warn your friends, they're all gonna die. Go! Frieda! Thank god. They've got Mark, and tring's gone after Miguel and the kid. Hurry! You gotta do somethin' or they're all gonna die! Calm down. Tell US what happened. They killed ebb. They killed ebb, Ben! They just strung him up like a-- well, sheriff? I'm sorry. I thought I was doin' right. I didn't wanna see anybody get hurt. Where's Mark? He's at the double k. Jeb's with him. He's hurt. You've gotta get him out. He needs a doctor real bad. What about the kid? They're on their way back. Tring's gone after him to stop him. Can Jeb take care of Mark? I'll take care of Mark. You take care of the kid. Let's go. [Door slams] They miss you yet? [Chuckling] No. How many? Stone, maybe two. Maybe three. And your darling brother Brent? Hyah! Hyah! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! Check it out. [Miguel] Kid! Ahh! [Grunts] [Sighs] Great. Ahh! [Chuckles] [Man] Ahh! Look out. Ahh! [Gasping] You missed all the fun. [Grunting] Not all of it. [Yelps] [Gasps] [Yells] [Thud] Once chance is all anyone gets. Been quite a week, huh? [Horse whinnies] [Cocks gun] Here we go. Gi-give me the rifle. That's far enough, Brent! Jeb? Get out here, Jeb. Not this time. You want me, you come in and get me. What do I do about Jeb? Don't kill him... Unless you have to. [Malick] Jeb. I'm comin' in, Jeb. I'm not gonna let you take him. Get him out here, then. We'll find out who he works for, sooner or later. If it means so much to you, little brother. Ahh! [Groans] [Yells] [Gasping] [Panting] I didn't think... You could do it. Why not? I'm your brother. [Horse whinnies] [Cocks gun] Ahh! [Horse whinnies] Here comes the cavalry. They're always fucking late. Whoa! He'll live. Come on, son. Don't make a liar out of me. [Coughs] Attaboy. You are the sorriest-looking bunch I ever did see. How did you manage to come through in one piece? It pays to delegate. Shoot, where's the fun in that? You guys gonna wait for me? You're all crazy. Got any better place to go? No. How long you plan on stayin' here? As long as it takes Miguel to get a girl. I already did. You already did what? Got a girl. What? Don't look at me!
