Constance... We told you to stop this. He's not selling... He's changed his mind. Anyway, that's irrelevant. Just come out. Come on. Come on, hurry up. Get your things and get out. Go on, don't keep them waiting. It's really heavy. Hello, Alain, it's Constance. Am I disturbing you? If I am, I can call you later. Constance... Constance Beauvau. I'm calling, because I have a question for you. How can I put it? I'm coming back to the region to look after my mother. So, I was wondering whether... I expect things are slow there, too. Would your agency have anything for me? Any work? You know, some work... Why? No, I didn't know. That's great. So... So, I'm calling... at the right time... I get off at the next stop. And you? The one after. - Thanks. - Live there? No way! I'd freak out. - I'm visiting my mother. - Oh? Me too. I'm visiting my mother. Aren't they awful? We go far away from them, they manage to drag us back. Mine's hospitalized. I had to pick up a rental car. I can't now. Visiting time will be over. It's fucking outrageous. Sorry, I'm on edge, but there's not even an announcement. You OK? That's crazy, my mother's hospitalized, too. I'm sorry. Alain! I'm pleased to see you. - You OK? - What're you doing here? I said I was coming back. Can I have a coffee? I have a 9 o'clock appointment, so it's tight. We'll be quick, then. I don't understand why you're hesitant. I learned a lot in Paris. Wasn't I good? You were. So? Listen, Alain. With the new station, the Parisians will flock here. However, the Parisians are very demanding. They focus on these tiny details, they turn up with a list of questions, they note everything down... This professional act is all a front. I don't know why they have to look more professional than you. And there's a Parisian vocabulary. You have to think boho, but I love that. Then, what? I train your replacement in case you walk out again? Oh, Alain... It was nothing to do with you. When they offered me that job in Paris, it was very hard to turn it down. - You dropped me in the shit. - I know. What can I say? I can't go back. Time has passed. I just turned 40. I understand a lot of things now, I... And I'm a very good worker. Thanks for the coffee. - Can I see my office? - If you like. - Hello, Mr. Collet. - Hi, Audrey. How are you? - Fine, you? - Fine. Have a seat. Thanks. Got your résumé? Yes, and a covering letter. OK, let's have a look. - Do you want a coffee? - Yes, please. Constance Beauvau! - Nathalie! - Wow! That new hair color is such a change! Crazy! It's funny to see you! - You look well. - Yep. What're you doing here? I was meeting Alain. I'm working with him again. Great! I'm still in that apartment you found me. - Rue Poincaré? - I love it. It was great. I got a good price. You sure did! Good to see you. Isn't it weird, being back here? A bit, but I'd had enough of Paris. It's such a race. I got allergies... Remember Ludovic Mézenat? Judith's husband? He's my husband now. We have 2 kids. - Twins? - No. Still got my number? If it hasn't changed. - So, call me. - OK. I gotta run. Let's keep in touch. Hey, don't tell Philippe you saw me. I want to tell him. See you! This is Philippe Ferrand. Leave a message. Oh, the bastard! This is Philippe Ferrand. Leave a message. That was mean! You saw it was me. Maybe I don't want to talk to you. You didn't erase my number? No, I kept it in case you called, to avoid answering. What's that? What? The blond hair? - Think you're Marilyn? - Like it? I don't know. Is it to hide your grey hair? You're here to look after your mother? Can't I look after my mother? You vape? How ridiculous! And you vape outside! What a clown you are! Got time for a drink? Why the fuck are you here? The first 6 months went well. I did some great sales. I was damn lucky. So, Lopez loved me. He was your boss? He started inviting me for drinks after work. He kept telling me I was an ideal candidate for promotion. I wasn't suspicious, because he's married with 3 kids. And? And... I soon found myself in a complicated situation at work. He gave me more responsibility, which was good, but he sent me texts which were totally... obscene. He sent me 50 to 70 texts a day. It was hard to send him packing, you know. One morning, I left home one Saturday. I remember it was market day. I went out, he was there waiting. He wanted us to go for a romantic weekend. Crazy. Oh, yeah, he's crazy. A psychopath. I mean, if he knew what a pain you are, he'd never have suggested going away for the weekend. It was a pretty traumatic experience. It was violent. So, I told him he had to stop, that I was going to press charges. So, I got an email the next day. I had to leave the office and give it all back: iPhone, iPad... And I wasn't allowed to set foot in the office again. The asshole fired me for gross misconduct. If you're not to blame, take him to court, you'll win. Yeah. I've got a lawyer. He's gonna pay. But he contacted all the agencies in Paris, 'cause he has a network. He got me blacklisted all over Paris. That's not possible. He can't have done that. I haven't found a job in the past year. I'm on welfare. I tell people... "I've had enough of Paris. I'm back to look after my mother." That's crap. I have nowhere to live. Will you talk to Alain about me? You've got a nerve. Please... It's important to me. I don't want to work with you every day. Really? Why did you never call? In 6 years, dammit! Yeah, uh... I don't know. I'm sorry, I don't know. I guess... Well, yes, I... Yes... I was mad at myself for giving in to you again. I feel like hitting you when you say that. That's so humiliating, "giving in again". I didn't force you to sleep with me. It takes two to tango. I didn't jerk off on you. Philippe... you were in love. Will you talk to Alain? I'll call you. I love that. My leggings! England... Oh, Platini! Gérard Janvion, Patrick Battiston, Maxime Bossis, Dominique Rocheteau... Paul... Franck? I don't remember a thing. The more you visit her and talk to her, the better it is for her. Yes, I know. I couldn't come before. Trouble at work. You're here now. I'm a bit nervous. Yes, it's me. It shook me up, seeing you last night. I didn't think I'd react like that. I know you're in the shit, I can't let you sink. I just told Alain he should hire you. I think he will. I'll call you after volleyball. I loved it when my mom worked here. Remember how we'd get locked in? I remember. I visited her this morning. Your mother? This morning. And? It was rough. Want a lift? Or would you rather run behind the car? Look out. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... Here goes! - What is that? - Classy, huh? Did you install it? It's so tacky. Antoine took me to an auction. We had a blast! It's crazy. You've got the strobes, the mirror ball, and all. Marius just loves it. He wants it on, on the way to school. I can't imagine you with a kid. What're you like? I don't know... I'm normal. He's a good kid, so... it's nice, it's cool. Well, I think it's too late for me now. Well, you didn't want kids. Glad to see me? I don't know. It's weird. Feels like we met 2 weeks ago. It's always like that. I don't see you for years, then off it goes as if everything was normal. I think I am pleased. I didn't think I'd be so pleased to see the house. I felt moved, too. All the memories... I'm wearing all my old T-shirts. But the yard is totally overgrown. I should cut the grass. Can I ring the neighbors' bell? Would they lend me the mower? - It's me. - Hey. He didn't choose you. Well, Alain didn't pick you for the job. Why not? Because the other girl agreed to work freelance. So, she'll just get commission. Why'd she accept that? I have no idea, Constance. How can we get by if idiots sell themselves short? Who can live on commission? I need a basic salary. I can't survive just on commission. What can I say? I'll see what I can do. I'll call a buddy. Don't worry. I'm not worried. What happened to your mother? She fell off a horse. Really? She rode at her age? Every day. That's rare, isn't it? Isn't that rare? What happened? The horse reared up. Did you say you're a tax consultant? More or less, yes. I did a great sale. I'm in property. It's a small agency, but with the new station, things are picking up. What did you say? Yeah, I said I'm in property. It's a small agency, but with the new station, things are picking up. Hey, how's it going? OK. I'm pretty tired, but otherwise OK. - You always say that. - What? You're always tired. They give me so much work. I know. - Did you think of me? - Not today. I haven't had time. Seriously? I won't lie to you. You don't even miss me. Of course I do, but you've started getting on my case already! Alex, don't talk to me like that. OK, good night. Over and out. Fuck! Am I disturbing you? No, no, I... I'm in bed. I have a headache. Oh, shit. Have you taken anything? I've taken pills, but they haven't done any good. I talked to Alain. Like I said, it's just about the pay. The girl's less of a risk. It's not you. Yeah, I know. Doesn't matter. I might go to Nantes and see if there's more work there. Anyway... maybe I'll go freelance, too. It's better than nothing. It's time for bed. I'll try and get some sleep. I'll call you tomorrow. OK, get some rest. Call me if you need to. Sure. Collet Real Estate. Audrey Pailleron speaking. Hello. I'm calling about an apartment to rent in Avenue du Général Leclerc. Number 34, I think. I'd like to visit it. Just let me check. Tomorrow? - Tomorrow at 2? - Perfect. Can I have your name, please? Mrs. Martin. Ségolène Martin. Oh, my God... Any questions? It's very noisy with the school next door. Yes, but after 4.30, it stops. And the double glazing is a big help. The windows were made to measure. Yes, but it's a problem, because I mainly work from home. So, I need peace and quiet. OK. Is it the original floor? It was partly renovated. But the whole place has wooden floors. And here... is another big room. My, it's very red! It was the owner's study. Don't you like it? I don't know. Do you? Been in property long? No, I graduated last year. Good for you. I like the job, and the new station makes things stimulating. Shall we continue? No, actually... Sorry. I like your bag. Is it genuine? - Yes, it was my grandma's. - Mine's almost the same. - My card. - Thanks. Got anything else to show me? In the center. It's pretty urgent. Sorry about this. Go ahead. I'm with a client. I'll call you back. I can't talk. I'll call back in 5 minutes. Call me later. I'm sorry. Are you OK? Yes, I'm OK. Nothing serious? No, it's alright. So, you'll let me know? Yes, of course. Hello. This is the week's schedule: biking, body bar... What's that? It's a group class to tone up the whole body. - Oh, hello! - Oh, hi! Funny to see you here. I left you a message. Did you get it? No, I didn't. How weird. Alex, can I have a towel? - Sure. - Thanks. We just got an apartment on Rue Jean Jaurès. Oh, really? It's really nice, modern, quiet. I think you'll like it. - OK. - Want to visit it? The machines aren't great. In Paris, I went to the Waou. - What's that? - The Waou... An upmarket gym. It's expensive, but worth it. - You go really fast. - Do I? I had no idea. Where's whatsit? Novgorod? In Russia. It's 490 km from Moscow and 170 from St Petersburg. That's precise! What does he do? He works for a supermarket chain. They're opening several superstores over there. His mother's Russian, so he's bilingual. It's a lucky break. Don't you want to join him? No, and I don't speak Russian. My family and friends are here. Your boyfriend's over there. First love is a precious thing. You fight for it. I don't know... - No? - Sure. - You're the first to say that. - Am I? Everyone thinks we'll break up. Why? No way. It's worth fighting for true love. At your age, I dreamed of going away. Honestly... Working in real estate here... You can do that later on. You should get out of here. I promise you. Maybe you're right. Audrey's going to be with Alexandre in Novgorod. She's right. They mustn't spoil things. They love each other. What'd she do here? It's not as if she's passionate about her job. OK, Alain won't be happy, but he's lucky: I'm here, I'm available, I'm competent. You won't be happy though. I threw out the cuckoo clock. I never did like it, so it's not a surprise. Anyway... Won't you wake up? It's boring, talking to myself. Come on, wake up. C'mon, you pain in the ass, wake up! I used to draw the dicks of guys I screwed. Really? I found an album at my mother's where I hid them. I was good at drawing. Can I draw your dick? If you like. You'll have a bruise on your ass. Sorry. Are you hungry? I didn't stop to eat today. There's the room service menu. They serve all night. Bagel with duck and sun-dried tomatoes, hamburger... Have whatever you want. Careful, I'll fall in love with you. Give me that. You've reached Gilles Lanquin. Please leave a message. It's me. I just had a visit. I'm sitting in the kitchen on the counter. Want to come? My legs are wide open. Come on. I want your cum. Who is it? It's me. Let me in. - OK? - Yeah. What're you up to? Nothing. Am I disturbing you? No. You put on makeup to do nothing! I was trying a few things. Get dressed. I'm taking you out. This fucking place! It's been a while, huh? Crazy! It hasn't changed! What's the stink? What? What does it smell of? It smells musty. Don't. We're going out. What's that? I'll get changed. Can't you use a plate? Is this all you eat? I maxed out my card. So, ask me. I can lend you some money. That's Mother's little secret! I even found one in the washing machine. Why? She was scared of her neighbors going through her trash. When you see them...! You're soaking. OK... Get dressed. We're going... Shake it, baby. I've run out. Be my guest! Good? Having fun? Better than tinned corn? No, I feel good. Dinner at the bowling alley. Hamburger with nice cold fries! I've become a real hick again! But I don't mind. "Hick"! Only you use that word. Really? No, I feel good. So do I. So, the girl at the agency who took... who stole my office... How's she getting on? If you think we'll talk about that tonight... you're sorely mistaken. Here. Not that much. You're crazy! It's OK. When you win your court case, you can pay me back. Well, thanks. Give me a drag. - No, you quit. - Go on. I don't inhale. Jeez... - Good, isn't it? - It sure is. What's the problem with that girl? Is she a taboo subject? I want to know if she works well. Who cares? You're busting my balls. Well, you could say that she's bad at her job, that she's lousy. Cheer me up. No. She does a good job. She's a nice girl. What annoys you about her? I don't know... There's not much. Just details... She doesn't wash her hands after using the bathroom. It's unhygienic. She's late every morning. That's weird. She has improbable excuses. I think Alain's going to explode soon. And she keeps going on about her boyfriend who's somewhere in Russia. I find that a bit of a pain in the ass. But there's not much. She arrives late? Audrey The Bitch It's a lovely staircase. Yes, it's a real feature. I could put my desk here. If you don't mind me asking, what do you do? I'm a tax consultant. I work for a Parisian firm who sent me here. It's only temporary, but as my mother's sick... I want to be near her. I'm sorry. I hope it's not too serious. It doesn't look good. Look, I love this place. There's just one thing that worries me. What about the arts center project? I happened to see the file. If it goes ahead, the building work will last a year. Then, it'll be very noisy at night. I have no idea, but I can call the agency. Yes, please do. It's Audrey. I'm with a client at the Rue Jean Jaurès apartment. Can you tell me about the arts center project? Alright. OK, fine. Thanks. I just spoke to my colleague. He said it hasn't been voted on by the local council. They have the final word. So, I could call them and ask. OK. - Could I have some water? - Sure. Thank you. I won't decide till I've got all the answers. You think of everything. Ever wanted to work in real estate? Certainly not. But I moved around a lot, so... How are your projects coming along? Things aren't really progressing. Really? If he'd asked me to go to New York, I'd have jumped at the chance. But Russia... especially at the moment... You need an open mind. You don't know a thing. You need to read up about it. Russian literature is fantastic. I know you want me to go far away. Not at all. On the contrary. I'd rather you stayed and found me an apartment. What? Why the smile? I thought you'd never take me out of the hotel room. Really? Isn't it nice, the two of us having dinner? I like being with you. I really do. So do I. You look good in this photo. A good ID photo is rare. Avenue Georges Mandel! Number 32. Wow! I love that rich neighborhood. Here. A little surprise for you. You're crazy! - What is it? - What do you think? It's a ball. And you slide it inside... Inside... And I have a remote control. You really are a big pervert! Want to try it now? No, I can't. After dinner, I'll take you back. I have a videoconference. And lots of work to do. It's a pain. Your turn. Contract your abs or you'll hurt your back. Go on. 1... 2... Contract them. Contract. 4. One more. Good. Let's go. Come on. You should be in the army! I thought about it as a kid. It was a way out of here. OK... Grab hold of the bar, contract, then pull up. I can't do that. - Try. - My arms aren't strong enough. Don't say that. Try to do at least 2. - Go on. - I can't. Go on, try. - I can't. - I'll help you. Try. Let's go. Stop it. It hurts. Stop! Please... It doesn't matter. No, it doesn't. Why didn't you take off to Paris sooner? You're nosy! I married a violent man. It took me 10 years to leave. Let's go. Come for a drink. I live near here. Let's go to the canal first. It's so pretty. Come on. It's far from finished. I'm surprised. I told you. Thanks. When do your parents get back? Next Monday. They've had crappy weather in Italy. My bedroom's there. I'll show you later. I check on the net about that question we had. You have to get married to get a long-term visa. - Alex said the same thing earlier. - Really? He thinks I've started packing. You mean you haven't started packing? I don't know... I hurt all over. You exhausted me. You change your mind a lot. It's normal to think things over. I must be 100% certain. You can never be 100% certain. No such thing. It's normal to have doubts. I just started my first job. I've gone back to my parents'. Alex and I keep arguing. - Can I take my shoes off? - Sure. What? I slept with a guy last night. Really? Who? Philippe. Who? The guy from the agency I told you about. Oh, yeah. I'll take a shower. Help yourself to anything. OK. Very funny, guys! Turn it on! You fucking idiots! - Scared? - What do you think? 'Morning. Mélanie... Can you cancel my doctor's appointment this evening? Come with me, Mrs. Beauvau. So... I met the other side to prepare for the face-to-face. There won't be a face-to-face with Mr. Lopez. He's humiliated me enough as it is. I refuse to meet him. I'm not happy. Why? I don't know how to defend you. I'll tell you. It's harassment in the workplace. We take them to court. Except it's your former boss that's taking you to court. Pardon? Mr. Lopez admits to an affair. Ah, at last. About time. That's good news, isn't it? Yes, but he says that when he tried to end it, you started harassing him. Pardon? Did you stalk him? That's insane! Who's the victim in all of this? Whose credit card is blocked? It's not up to me to justify myself. It's always like that, for some reason. The victim has to justify herself. The woman's always suspected. I find that shocking. Constance, you called your former boss 1,985 times between November 8, 2013 and March 4, 2014. You sent him 1,089 texts. And you slept outside his door. There are witnesses. I'm your lawyer, I'll defend you, but I have serious reservations about your chances of success. His wife manipulated and brainwashed him. You have reason to suspect Mrs. Lopez? She's hated me from the start. She called me yesterday. Yesterday? Yes, yesterday or the day before. She died of an aneurism, playing tennis with her son last month. You've reached Gilles Lanquin. Please leave a message. It's me. It's Constance. I'm in Paris. I don't have my egg, but I do have my little pussy. Call me. You've reached Gilles Lanquin. Please leave a... You've reached Gilles Lanquin. Please leave a message. You've reached Gilles Lanquin. Please leave a message. I'd love it if you stopped sulking. It's a pain. Go help your mother. I don't believe it. - Hello, Ségolène. - Yeah? There's a problem with this afternoon's visit. Can we do it tomorrow? - Yeah. - OK, great. How about going out tonight? I'll call you. I got to work an hour late. Was it your alarm clock again? No, my scooter wouldn't start. I had to come by bicycle. Did you get yelled at? No, I think. Alain's too angry to say anything. Strange he's so cool with you. Does he like you? Does he hit on you? No, he's really not like that. Strange he doesn't yell. I work hard. "I work hard" isn't everything. You're young and pretty. I bet he wants to bang you. Maybe that's why he hired you... Ségolène, I'll call you, OK? Where are our cocktails? Ah, thanks! I'm already totally wasted. Want to go home? No, I want to get trashed. Not working tomorrow? I am, but I can handle it. Come on. Audrey... Don't waste your life by staying here. Go to Novgorod or New York, but make the most of life. You're a great girl. - You're so sweet. - Promise me. - I trust you. - OK, I promise. Promise me. - Philippe's joining us. - What? Philippe's joining us. Cool! You'll get to meet him. Super! I'm going to the bathroom. Hello. Why are you here? Well? - Let me go. - This is my mom's room. You let anyone in. - He's so aggressive to me. - You let anyone in! Anyone at all. It's not enough to harass me. You come into my mother's room. All you care about is how much money you'll get - when you sell her estate. - What? - How dare you? - You disgust me. This isn't Mrs. Lanquin. Hey, come back here, you whore! You asshole! Let go! Get off me! What the fuck is all this shit? I can't stand being lied to. It makes me furious. I know everything. - Oh, yeah? - Where you live, where your wife works. I'm friends on Facebook with your son. I'll tell him how you fuck me like a bitch. Even stuff you forgot. In a flash, you're dead! You piece of shit. You whore! Wait for me. Are you OK? Keep going. Come on. Come on. I can't. I started too fast. It's too hot. Got no water? I don't have any. No, come on. Walk. Don't stop. I think you were right about Alain. I told you so. Typical horn dog behavior. Really? If he tries it on, sue. File a complaint straightaway. I might wait a bit. He offered me a permanent job. With all my screw-ups, he must be into me. Did you accept it? Yeah. My parents are so proud. What about Alexandre? If I accept the job, that's not the issue. Did you tell him? - We don't talk much. - Oh? - You knew that. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. - No, I didn't. What's wrong? What is wrong? Ségolène! What the fuck's wrong? What's wrong? Mrs. Beauvau? Hello. Will you be OK? I'll be back later. What was she doing up there? Sorry. Hello. Well, she often went running over there with a girlfriend. She said she liked the view of the canal. Do they say it's an accident? I have no idea. They don't know. - They're ruling nothing out. - What does that mean? Could it be an attack? Just think. I go running on the fitness trail every day. Maybe I already came across her. It's awful... I'll be nice. I promise I'll be nice. I'll be very nice. Want us to go away for a few days? If we're hard up, we can go camping. Do you want to stay here? What do you prefer? Look, I don't know. Stop it. Where's Alain? I'll go talk to him. Hang on. Alain... I'm sorry. Philippe called and told me. It's awful. - Thank you. - Do they know what happened? No, a jogger found her body this morning. Just think. I go running on the fitness trail every day. Maybe I already came across her. Was it an attack? Was she raped? No, we don't know. It's steep. You have to be careful. It's dangerous. It's better than an attack. I mean... - Can you make your statement? - OK. Any idea what happened? I go to the fitness trail every day. FAULTLESS Subtitles: J. Miller, a.s.i.f. Subtitling TITRAFILM
