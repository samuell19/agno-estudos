Okay, here's one. A blue Volkswagen? - No. - No. Yellow Ford? No. Red Chrysler? Honey, don't worry about what kind of car it is. That's impossible. Um, black? - Nope. - No. White? No. Red? - No. - No. - Blue? - No. - Red? - No. Black? No. I give up! Don't give up! All right. Let me do it. Black. Yep. White. Silver. Black. Yep. White. Black. I think I hear a truck coming. How does she do it? How can you do it? Ohh! How does she do it? How does she do it? Try it one more time. Try again. Silver. Yes. - My God. - Are you peeking? - I'm not peeking! - Yes, you are! I can't see through my hands. You must be doing this or something. I can see you in the rear-view mirror. She can't see. Look, okay. Ready? Silver. - Ohh, it's not fair! - She's too good. Some people have second sight, right? It's true that some people can sense things. All right, come on. Make sure she can't see. Black. Silver. How do you do that? I'm David Blaine. You're not like David Blaine. You're cheating. Are you cheating? Sore loser. Silver. - Yes. - Yep. Black. I think your hands are see-through, honey. They aren't. You've got see-through little fingers. White. Ohh, it's not fair! She's looking, isn't she? Mary! Mary! No! No! Mom! Mom! Mommy! It's all right, sweetie. It's okay, sweetheart. - Mommy! - It's okay. It's okay. - I want Mommy to come back! - Shh. Mommy! Mom! I want Mommy to come back! Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! It is a terrible shock when a life is cut short, when a daughter, who should outlive her parents, dies. We are here today to share our grief together and to pay tribute to Marianne's life. To myself and Laura, Marianne was a wonderful, loving daughter. To Joe, a beautiful wife. But perhaps most of all, to Kelly and Mary, a devoted mother. In her beautiful daughters, perhaps a little of Marianne lives on with us here today. One of Marianne's great loves was her... her love of music. She took great joy in passing on this enthusiasm to her students. Enthusiasm is contagious. It's a wonderful gift. A natural gift for a teacher. Marianne... loved to share her love of music with everyone. I can't do science. I can't even construct a sentence. - Thanks. - Yeah. You know, it should be easier, right, the downhill, but I find, you know... I'm going outside, okay? Yeah. Wrap up, okay? That means a coat and a scarf. I know, Dad. It's a miracle they survived. - Are you doing all right? - Yeah, I'm hanging in there. Thank you so much. Fuck! It's freezing! ...plan a vacation. - Well... So, what's, uh, what's going on? What are you working on? Uh... ...applying for grants. But nobody is reading poetry anymore these days. I read a bit. - Hey, guys, what's going on? - Hey. Thanks. Fuck. Haven't done this in a while. Yeah. Ohh! You fucking serious? Ugh! Oh, my God. Ooh. - Are you okay? - How did that happen? Think you want another hit, make you better? Oh, don't be dumb. Joe, I'm so sorry about Marianne. Thank you. Hey. Hi, Joe. Mm. Joe, I'm really sorry. Yeah. When are you due? - The 13th. - Oh, my God. Soon. - It is. - Mm. It is. Can I do anything? - No, I-I'm okay. - Okay. Oh, my God. Stop! Stop! Stop! Ow. Ohh! Look at how well I can skate now. You're doing great. I didn't recognize you. They said, "Thank you." Barbara is an old friend. I've known her forever. She's arranged for me to teach at the university there. Oh. You don't seem very impressed. Oh. No, I, uh... No, I'm just envious. Aah! But going away isn't a cure. Well, I'm not sick. What do the girls say? Well, I think a year in Italy at their age would be fantastic, don't you? Do them a lot of good. Give them a language. When I was your age, I could do it so much better than you. Look, we'll go crazy if we stay in the apartment. Well, there's a big difference between leaving the apartment and leaving the country. Are you sure it's such a good idea to uproot the girls? Ohh! Watch out. ♪ We're off, we're off, we're off on a holiday ♪ - ♪ We're off, we're off ♪ - Dad! Please, Dad. - ♪ We're off on a holiday ♪ - You're so embarrassing. ♪ Oh, we're off, we're off, we're off, we're off ♪ Stop it! It says here that Genova used to be, like, the richest city in the world. Really? Well, yeah, they invented the bank, and, like, all the money came to them. Wow. Excuse me, Madam, could you please switch off your iPod for landing? Ow! Is it your ears? - Excuse me. - Yes, sir? Do you have anything like a sweet or something she could suck on? I'm gonna have a look. Dad! It hurts. Try... try holding your nose. Now close your mouth and blow. Pinch your nose and close your mouth and blow. Ow! See if that helps, okay? Did you know Christopher Columbus was from here? I thought he was from Spain. No, he was born here, but he sailed from Spain. So that's why South America is Spanish and not Italian. Mary, you've never been to Italy before, have you? No. - Do you like pasta? - Yeah. Do you like ice cream? Then you'll be fine. So, why, um... why are there so many English flags? Well, they're... they're not English. They're the flags of, uh, St. George. St. George is the patron saint of Genova, and England actually just borrowed him. You're better than this guidebook. Well, thanks. It comes with the territory. A lot of the courses that we teach actually have a strong cultural element. So, when does the teaching start? Oh, not for a week. Anyway, I've found you an apartment, and, um, it's qui... it's near the university. It's not perfect, but it's okay. I think you'll like it. So, that's great. Thank you. So, what do you two want to do, um, you know, before school starts? You have the whole summer. I'd want to just spend my summer sleeping, relaxing, tanning. Now, there's a surprise. - Vacationing in Italy. - Really? - That sounds good. - What else am I supposed to do? They play the piano. Oh, I could organize piano lessons. Mm. Well, it'd be something to do. You don't want to just... want to lie in bed all day. I don't? And who told you that? I should've known better. Your mom taught piano, didn't she? - Yeah. - Or music? At the university, she taught piano. Look, really, I feel strange not saying anything, so I just... I really wanted to say I'm so sorry about what happened. I just... it must have been terrible. Thank you. Yeah. Sure. - That was great. Thank you. - You're welcome. Old town sounds nice. Is it? Yeah, it's beautiful. This is the, um, Strada Nuova. It's the "new street." - It's amazing. - Yeah, you like it? It was built in the 16th century. Well, it's not that new. It's said that one-third of all the silver from the New World ended up in these houses. Wow. That's a lot of silver. We're just gonna go down here. This is the old town, the Medieval town. And you have to be extremely careful here because it's very easy to get lost in these alleys. He can't hear very well. You have to speak up. It's quite nice. You want to come and see the kitchen? This is nice. It's very big and... - Kelly? - Mm-hmm? Yeah? Come and have a look at this. You two could share this room. Why would we share a room? 'Cause there's another one down there. I'd rather be in a small room than share a room with her. You could sleep in this bed on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and that one on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Or if she pees in that bed, she can go sleep in the other. - Don't be horrible. - I'm just being honest. It'll be fun to have a room by myself. A food processor, something for the kitchen. We're not going clothes shopping today. We can go in there, and you and I can both get something. Nice try. You can go book shopping, and I can go clothes shopping. Are you okay? Kelly! That's enough. Pick your plate up. How hungry are you? I'm pretty hungry. Hungry. That's good. Water into wine. There you go. - Thanks. - There you go. Apparently it's bad luck to toast with water. Wish me luck? - Good luck. - Good luck. And to your first piano class. Yeah, thanks. How come you never cooked this at home? Well... This was a voyage of discovery for me. - Dad? - Yes? Can I have some real water? Yes. Sorry. - Good night. - Good night. - Is it good? - Yeah. Do you want me to close the windows? Is it too noisy? It's hot. Ready for lights-off? Yeah. - Good night, sweetheart. - Good night. Love you. Love you, too. - Good night. - Good night. Sleep well. I love you. I love you, too. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! It's okay. It's okay, sweetheart. - Mom! - No, no, no. I'm here. - It's okay. Come on. Shh. - Mom! Mom! - Come on. Come on. - Mom! Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Come on, sweetie. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! So, this map is turning out to be completely useless. Should be down here somewhere. What do you say... right or left? - Left. - Left. Barbara said it was past a small church. Yeah, but we've passed a thousand churches already. This is it. Yeah, that's the church. Not now. Come on, girls. - Wow! - Come on. We got to get moving. Come on, girls. Here we are. Ciao. Ciao. - Hello. Nice to meet you. - Piacere. I'm Gerry. - Ciao. I'm Monica. - And there is Monica. And Angelica. Carlo? Hello, Angelica. Ciao. My students are on summer. Oh, no, no, no, no, I-I can get us home. I swear. - No, I remember. - Do you want the map? - No, no. - You sure? - Bye, girls. - Bye, Dad. So, who's gonna defend Italy's honor? I think the article is right. Most people behave in a crazy way. People all want to do exactly the same thing at exactly the same time. That is a really Italian thing. - Italians are conformists. - Yes. No, I don't agree. We are here, not on the beach. That's the proof. And what's wrong with going to the beach? Nothing. We are all going there after. Even though all the young... young people, we use condoms now... everybody uses condoms, but the pope... he continue to say no for years and years. Is it rather like having a parent that you... ...that you can rebel against? - Yes. 'Cause everybody says, "We are not conformist," but everybody is. - That's your friend's. - Yeah. It's been, like, a really long time since I've played. Bravo! I can't read Italian. Come on. Are you sure this is the right way? Yeah. Fuck. Come here. It's that way. No, it's this way. - Hi. - Ciao. - Hi. - Hi. Ciao. Would you like to join us for a coffee? Oh, I'd... you know, I'd love to. I just... I have to rush because I have children. Um, next time maybe. - Yes, okay. - Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. Ciao. Hi, Daddy! Hello! Hi. - Hi. - How was it? It was fine. Was he okay? Yeah, it was fine. - Hi. - Hi. Did you enjoy it? Yeah, they have two really cute kids. They are so funny. We got lost on the way home. - Oh, really? - No, we didn't. Can we go to the beach? Do you want to eat here or do you want to eat down on the beach? - On the beach. - Here. Do you two never agree? Don't stick your head out. Hey. Sea. Ciao! Ciao! - How are you? - I'm good. How are you? Fine, thanks. It's free, this? Yes, of course. We need to get in more shallow water. I'm coming. I'm going to shallow water right now. So it's not just Italian who likes the beach, huh? 40 million Italians can't be wrong, huh? Um, we are with some friends further up the beach if you want to join us. Okay. Well, my children are in the sea at the moment. - Okay. - Maybe in a while? In the blue café at the end, okay? That would be nice. See you. - Ciao. - Ciao. Aah! I'm done. No, you're not! Come on, please? - I'm gonna go sunbathe, okay? - Why? Because I want to be alone for a little bit. Can we get an ice cream? - You want to go get an ice cream? - Yeah. How do you say "ice cream" in Italian? I don't know. "Un gelato, per favore"? Very good. She's very beautiful, your daughter. Yes, she is. You must be very... uh, prou... prou... proud? She's really tired, she looks. Hi, Mary. Dad. I wet the bed. So you did. You can go sleep in your bed if you want. You sure? Yeah, I'll be all right. Hmm? Mm-hmm. Okay. Um, you guys. I'm gonna go out for a little walk, and I'll be back in like... by 12:00. - Okay. - Ciao. Ciao. Okay, at the beginning. No, no. Adagio. Adagio. Oh. Due... tre. Salve. Sorry I'm late. It's all right. So, how long have we got? An hour. Let's go, darlin'. "Darling." Ciao! Ciao, Angelica. Ciao, Carlo. Oh, I-I'm so sorry I'm late. Where'd you go? Just for a walk. Where? Shopping. Who with? No one. If you don't tell me, I'm telling Dad. Don't you threaten me. Wait! We might not have time to go to the beach today. Why not? We have to go to a reception. This is for the governor of Liguria. So, why do Mary and I have to go? 'Cause I promised Barbara. There's a church that she wants to show Mary which is nearby. I have to go to this boring party because of you and Mary? Do you know, you're really selfish! Fine. You need to be ready in 15 minutes, okay? It's beautiful. Thanks. What's that? Venice and Genova were the two biggest trading cities in Italy. Did they fight wars? Just... yeah, over trade, yeah. And Marco Polo actually was imprisoned here with 7,000 other Venetians. Ugh! God, it smells like urine. Pretty flowers. Yeah, they're nice. They're for the dead. Somebody must have died there. So, when you guys go to the reception, can I just leave? What do you mean, "leave"? Where? I'm just going to a café with some friends. Who? The boys and the girls that we met with Rosa. That's the annunciation. That's what the basilica was named after. What's happening? That's when the archangel Gabriel comes down from heaven and tells Mary that she's gonna be the mother of Jesus. Because she'd never had sex, so she's like, "How could I be pregnant?" She had a cousin named Elizabeth. She was barren, but she had just become pregnant with John the Baptist. What does "barren" mean? Well, it's when a woman can't become... become pregnant. Do you want to light a candle? Yeah. I will give you some money. That was a good one. Do you believe in life after death? You mean like heaven? Yeah. I like to think that people just live on in other people's memories, you know? It's not a funeral, okay? It's a boring party. Hello. Salve. Salve. Stephen. Hi. Oh. Hi. - Ciao. - Ciao. You look beautiful. Beautiful. - This is Kelly. - Hi. - And Mary and Joe. - Hi. Joe is here now teaching at the university. I think me and Mary are gonna go mingle. Where did you two meet? Uh, well, we actually met at Harvard, uh, years ago. I mean, do you speak Italian? Is that why you're teaching here? Not really, no. Not very well. If you want to understand about Italy, you have to learn the language. Thank you. You know what they call... what do they call Genova? - Superba. - Superba. La superba. Superba. Superba. Ciao. I just got to check on the... We should all get together sometime. We'll have you over for dinner. That would be great. Welcome you properly to la superba. Did you two have a... thing at Harvard? No, these tall guys, you know... Have you two met? Tall women are different. - Tall women are good. - They're good. I've found you. Oh, thank God! I'm leaving, okay? Yeah, can we come with you? - No. No. - I wanna go! I'm joking. I'm just... I'm joking. Now, we're gonna be back at the apartment in an hour. - You'll be back by 10:00, okay? - Why? Because it's a strange city. You don't know your way around. - But you brought me here. - No, at 10:00. Hi. Sorry. Do you smoke? Thank you, thank you. No mirror! Damn it! No! Uh-oh! I should go. - Bye. - Bye. Oh. Hi. You're late. Sorry. Good night. So, has the... has the euro had any impact on the Italian sense of identity? Do you feel more European, less Italian? Well, we don't have just one identity anymore. I can feel Italian and European and Genovese because I study here, but Neapolitan, too, because I am from Naples, or a woman and a bourgeois. All right, but what's the most important? Hmm? Neapolitana, or being bourgeois, being radical, being Italian, or being... A woman. Okay. We have fun, not like you. Look, there's a village set into the edge of the cliffs there. - Wow. - Do you see that? I think I'm gonna go for a swim, okay? Have fun. Give her a... Try one, Mary. It's really good. Ew. Dad, why would I want to eat it? Shall we go to the monastery? Sure. I'll stay with Kelly. - The cicadas are loud! Look. Why did they choose to build the monastery here? Well, I guess... As a retreat, you know? They wanted a retreat from the world. They just wanted to live for God. Some monks even took a vow of silence. They didn't even talk to each other. That must be strange. I'd hate it, although some people might be glad, as I tend to talk a little too much. I like listening to you talk. - Did you get burnt? - No. I'm a professional candle lighter. I'm gonna light one for my mom. Oh. Kelly? You all right? Dad! Go away! Don't be too long, okay? Light. There you go. That's good. I was in the car when Mommy died. I know. Must have been awful. She comes to me sometimes. Really? Yeah. Don't tell anyone. I won't. Not if you don't want me to, I won't. She comes to forgive me. She... you have nothing to be forgiven about. It wasn't your fault. You didn't do anything. It was an accident. A terrible accident. I did. It was my fault. - No, no. - Yes. - Mary. - It was my fault. So, are you gonna tell me about your new friends? They're not really friends. I just met them. But I'm gonna go to a party with them later tonight. Oh, really? A topless party? I just think you might have asked. Okay. - No. - No? Grazie. Is Mary with you? - No, I thought she was with you. - She was. She... She took off. She ran off. Oh, she's a sensible girl. I'm sure she'll find her way back. I think we should go look for her, really. - Wait, what's going on? - Uh... Mary's gone. Look... please. Well, Mary wandered off apparently, so we're just gonna go and have a little look for her, okay? Okay, well, she's a sensible girl. I'm sure she'll find her way back. We should look for her, though. - I'll stay here. - Yes. - How long ago was it? - Just... just now. So, what happened? I don't know. She... I think the church spooked her. God, I feel terrible. Where does this path lead? To Santa Margherita, I think. Go get Kelly. Get the last boat back, okay? And then I think you should probably tell the police in Camogli. And I'll see you back at the flat, okay? We'll just, uh... I'll meet you there. - Okay. - All right? But what are you gonna do? No, it's fine. I'm gonna walk to Santa Margherita. - Take care. - Okay. Oh, fuck! Mary?! Mary?! Mary?! Mary?! Mary?! Mary?! Mary?! Mary?! Mary?! Fuck. - Hello? - Did you find her? No, did you? No. No, I just... I'm gonna get the train. I'm on my way. Mary! Dad! Ohh! You okay? Is she okay? Yeah. She fell asleep on the train. Ohh. - They're back. - Oh, great. - Is she okay? - Yeah. She's completely out cold. Ohh. I love you. I love you, too. Man, this song. I just... I think of school. What was the name of that band you were in? - That fucking awful band. - No! Jesus, not one of us could play. No! Here, give me a... It was good. You were great, really. God, I was such a nerd, man. I studied so hard and... But you just... I was so jealous of you and your academic career. Don't you have an academic career? Not a serious one. Well, nobody... nobody has a serious academic career. No? What actually happened? We went to the monastery. And, um... Then... then I think something made her think of Marianne, and she just took off. Did she say anything? We lit a candle, and then she just disappeared. You know, Mary has a... has a very lively imagination, and maybe lighting candles for dead people isn't what she needs right now. Yeah, maybe. Listen, I'm just... I'm very, um... I'm so sorry about today, really. And it must be just incredibly hard for all of you. They're beautiful kids. Did they have counseling? Yeah. Yeah, they saw someone after the accident. You're all very brave. Yeah, well, we don't... listen, we don't have much choice. No. Yeah. Listen, I need to go to bed. I'll go. I should go. I just think that, you know, she feels very, very guilty about... about Marianne, Joe. And I think that she needs help. Maybe. Okay. I'm sorry. Good night. Yeah. All right, you need a cab or anything? - No, I'm okay. Thanks. - Sure? - Yeah. The walk will do me good. - So, listen, take care. I will. Thanks. ♪ The remainders of a shooting star ♪ ♪ Landed directly on our broken-down little car ♪ ♪ Before then, we had made a wish ♪ ♪ That we would be missed ♪ Ciao. Who's he? He's nobody. Is he your boyfriend? No. Yeah, right. You know what? Don't even fucking talk to me. And don't walk next to me, either. Was Barbara your girlfriend at the university? No. She wants to be. Don't be silly. - Did you make out? - Look, what is this? - Did you go to dances? - Did you two plan this? It was 20 years ago. At least. Yeah, o-okay, thank you. Thank you very much. Why don't we talk about some of Kelly's boyfriends? No, thanks. I think that would be a much more interesting conversation. - Did you kiss? - No, we did not kiss. That was too long! Hi! Ciao. I see you! She enjoy it, huh? Yeah. Che bravissima! Watch again. You're a very good swimmer! What about her mother? Is... is she in America? No, her mother died about six months ago in a car accident. I'm sorry. Children are... are very strong, I think. Kelly? Kelly? Remember we've got to go and visit the school this afternoon, okay? Fine. Pretty strict about being on time, so we have to hurry. Hi! Hi, Dad! I don't want to have to set foot in that school again. I'm not going there. I'll go back to Chicago. Well, that's very eloquent. You look tired. I don't feel tired. Having trouble getting up in the morning? Maybe you should stay in tonight. Oh, thank you! Sure you don't want ice cream? No! I don't want ice cream! And I'm sick of you treating me like I'm some stupid child. What the fuck are you looking at? - This is all... - Hey! This is all her fault. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm not having that kind of language. Are you okay? Huh? You two okay? Sure. Okay, time to brush your teeth. Come on. Wait. No. Can I finish the sentence? No, you can't finish the sentence. If you're very quick, you can have another 10 minutes. Okay. All right. Hey. All right, young lady, we need to have a conversation about the state of your room. Hmm? What happened here? Fabio! Cuba libre! So, when I saw you on the station in Santa Margherita, what were you doing there? Why do you ask? Well, I don't know. The platform was for the trains going the other direction. Which pictures did you see? Lots. I saw Mom. She was on the platform. Do you see her a lot? Sometimes. Do you talk to Kelly about Mom? No, not really. No one ever talks about her. It's like we're pretending she never existed. Who pretends she never existed? It's hard to know what to say or when to say it. Do you miss her? Yes, I do. Of course I do. All the time. All the time? Every hour of every day? Every day of every month, every month of every year, every year of every... All right, no, not every hour of... Every decade of every century? And every century of every millennium? Momma wants you to be happy, you know? I know. That's what... that's what she tells me. I'm happy when I'm with her. Talks to you? Yes. Hmm. What does she say about me? Dad! Hi, Mommy. Is everything okay? Yes. You know I love you. I love you, too. Go to sleep. Okay. Good night. Good night. Hey. Sorry. I forgot my keys. Joe. Come va? Bene. You? Do you want to have a coffee? Yeah, we're all going to the café across the street. Would you like to join us? Uh, sure. It's okay? - Yeah. - Yeah, I'd love to. No, I mean, we can go somewhere else. No, no. Oh, no. I'd love to. Ciao! Arrivederci, bambini! Joe. Joe? Would you like something? Just a water. Flat water. Are you getting all the students drunk? - Are we going to the disco? - Kelly. What the fuck are you doing?! Have you just been standing there? You little piece of shit! Are you fucking spying on me? You better not say anything to fucking Dad because, I swear to God, I will kill you, all right? I'll fucking ruin your entire life like you did mine! Piece of fucking shit! Buon giorno, belle ragaz ze! - Hi, Daddy! - Hi. I made you spaghetti carbonara. Really? You spoil me. Who taught you how to do this? Mom. Look what your sister's produced. Looks good. - How was piano? - It was good. I finally got to the end of the piece. Well, congratulations. That's fantastic. - Thank you. - So, when can I come and listen? Um, soon. Mmm, God, this is exactly what the doctor ordered. "When 40 winters shall besiege thy brow, and dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field, thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now, will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held: Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies, where all the treasure of thy lusty days, to say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes, were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise. How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use, if thou couldst answer, 'This fair child of mine shall sum my count and make my old excuse, ' proving his beauty by succession thine. This were to be new made when thou art old, and see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold." Just write a description of your... feelings when you hear that or read that sonnet. It is your last assignment, so you can get away with anything. Maybe we... we can do something special on Friday for the end of the course. - Sounds good. - Hmm? Just the... the two of us... maybe. Okay. - All right. Yes. - Okay. - Ciao. - Ciao. Hi. Hi. - Hi. How are you? - I'm good. How are you? Good. I'm excited. Thank you for inviting me. It was beautiful. Would it be okay for the girls to stay a bit later on Friday? It's just... it's the last day of the course I'm running, and some of the students have suggested we have a drink. - You must be Mr. Popular. - Yeah. At 4:00 or so. - Okay. - At 4:00. Yeah. No, I'll be back by 4:00. That's fine. - Is that... that's okay, right? - Yeah. Got a little party thing. I didn't know your class was having a party on Friday. It's not a party. It's just lunch. With Rosa? Oh, God! It's just a lunch! You don't have to feel guilty. Just... you know, it's fine. Trying to keep things a bit vague for the children. Don't you think it's better maybe to be open and honest with people? Children, especially? You've been very kind and very helpful. But I do not need your advice, okay? Yeah, this is my turn. Okay, I'll see you later. Thank you for the concert. Bye. Ciao. Ciao! You played beautifully today. I'm so proud of you. Kelly plays better. Well, she's older. I think she'll be a really good pianist, just like you, when she grows up. Silver. Black. I don't want to go to school here, Mommy. Why not? I want to be with you. Please, Mommy! Mommy! - It's all right. - Mommy! It's all right, my darling. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Shh. It's okay. Mommy! Shh. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Mommy! Hey, hey, hey. Shh. It's okay. Mommy! Hey. Okay. Okay. You know, it doesn't matter what happened. I love you. And I'm so sorry you were in that car. I'm so sorry you were in that car when it crashed. It's a terrible thing, but it's happened, and it's done. And it's over. You should get ready, sweetie. Come on. I don't want you to be late, and I've got to go. - You're wearing perfume. - It's aftershave. So, I'll, uh, see you at Gerry's at 4:00, okay? - Okay, Daddy. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Have fun with Rosa. What's that supposed to mean? Well, that's who you're gonna go and have lunch with, right? Oh, is it? Who told you that? Lorenzo. They're friends, remember? Right. - Ciao, Monica. - Ciao. I'll be back by 4:00 to get her. - Ciao, Kelly. - Okay, ciao. Bye. Okay. I see. When I first come in Genova as a student, um, I used to work here. That's why I know them like a family, no? I bring here just people that I really like. Do you want to go for a swim? No, I can't, 'cause I have to go back soon. Soon? Why? Well, 'cause I have to be back by 4:00. Where are we going? Don't you worry. - Monica. - Si? Lorenzo, I need to go. I don't need to go. What do you mean, you don't need to go? It means that it's the middle of the day. Why do we need to go? Well, how else am I supposed to get back? I mean, why would you bring me here if you weren't gonna take me back? Do I look like a taxi driver? I can walk by myself. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm fine. I've done it before. Really, I'll be fine. There is a station in the next town. So, if you want to go... And how far is that? Three... four kilometers. Something like that. - Are you gonna take me there? - No way. You know what? Fuck you. - Ciao. - Ciao. Kelly! Kelly! Hey! - You okay? - No. - Do you have an extra helmet? - No problem, no problem. This church was built to give thanks for the end of a plague. They wanted to pray for the souls of the children who died. And to pray that no more would be taken by God. Oh. I wish that you could always be with me forever. Amen. Mom? Hello? - Joe, it's Barbara. - Yeah? Listen. Monica just called. Um, she's been trying to get through to you. And, uh... but anyway, they've had to leave. But Kelly wasn't back yet, so Mary's... she's gone back to the apartment by herself. But Kelly's supposed to be with Mary. Where is she? - I just saw her. - Where? Is there a way down here? I can't see a way down. Good luck. Mom! Mary! Mary! Oh, my God! - Oh, my God. - I'm sorry. Are you all right? Are you okay? Are you okay? Let me see. Let me see. My baby. All right. Okay. - Don't go, okay? - No, I won't. I'm not going anywhere. All right. No, no, no. See? They're all okay. See? Grazie. Grazie. Let's go. Okay. Right. Yeah. Well... I'll see you at work, then. Or whenever. I'll see you next week. Bye, darling. Bye, Barbara. Good-bye. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. "Vorrei"... It's "I would like." It's quite a polite way to say it, okay? "Parla piú lentamente?" "Please, can you speak more slowly?" But don't be afraid to say, "I don't understand," okay? "Non ho capito." But people are gonna be nice to you. They understand. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Nervous? A little. It's normal. Grazie mille. Ciao, Daddy. Hey, you know it's traditional in Italy to kiss your parents good-bye, even when you're grown up. Bye, Dad. You'll be fine. I love you. Love you, too.
