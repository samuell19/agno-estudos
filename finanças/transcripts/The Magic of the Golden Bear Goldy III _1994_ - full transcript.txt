[ Quacking ] [ Growling ] [ Grunting ] Woman: The capital of Spain is? - Children: Madrid. - Very good. The capital of France is? Children: Paris. - The capital of england? - London. Very good. Now we will do our multiplication. Fours. Four times two is-- - eight. - Everybody. - All: Four times three equals-- - 12. All: Four times four equals-- - 16. - Excellent. All: Four times five equals-- - everybody. - All: 20. Four times six equals 24. - [ Bangs ruler ] - Just a moment, class. Just a moment. It seems that my lessons in hygiene and grooming have come to a sudden stubborn resistance. [ Whistles ] Ow! Young lady, how many times have I told you to wash your feet and to wear shoes? - But my feet hurt in those things. - That's no excuse. And I can't run as fast or feel the mud between my toes or the cool wet grass. My feet feel shut away and just plain ignored. - [ Class laughs ] - Silence! Silence! Young lady, the next time you come to school without shoes, you're going to stay in during recess and sweep the floors and empty the ashcan. Do you understand me? Do you understand me? - Yes, ma'am. - All right. - All right. - [ Bangs ruler ] Now where were we with the multiplication? - Four times seven. - Four times seven. All: Four times seven equals-- [ mumbles ] 28. - Let's hear it. - [ Louder ] 28. All right, everybody. All: Four times eight equals-- - everybody. - [ Bear grunts ] - [ Gasps ] Goldy, go back. - Very good. - No. Shh. No. - Four times nine equals-- - 36. - Okay, fine. All: Four times 10 equals 40. - Excellent. - No go on. All right, that's enough multiplication. Now I want you to work on your spelling until I ring the bell for lunch. - [ Giggles ] - What is so funny? Who is giggling? [ Gasps ] - Oh! - [ Children laughing ] Your bear is riding my bicycle! Oh! Your bear has stolen my bicycle! Miss barley, don't scare goldy. [ Children shouting, laughing ] My bicycle! Give me my bike! That bear! My bike! Oh! Oh! Oh! That bear ruined my bicycle. Jessie: Miss barley, I told you not to scare goldy. He destroyed my bicycle, I told you. Oh, my bicycle. Where is that bear? Oh, it's ruined. That bear. [ Caws ] How uncivilized. You pet bear devoured our lunches. Yeah, look what your stinky old goldy did. She doesn't stink. She takes a bath with me every Saturday night. Oh, what a mess. Children, get to your seats. Get to your seats. Get to you seats, everyb-- [ sighs ] [ Roars ] Hey, pa. Look, pa. - Melvin's found another one, pa. - Another one, pa. I can see that, Floyd. I got eyes. Dang. Four busted traps in one day. Somebody's trying to put US out of business. - Maybe it's the ghost man. - Floyd, I keep telling you, there ain't no such thing as a ghost man. [ Hooting ] I heard different, pa. I heard he eats poachers. How many times I got to tell you, Melvin? We ain't poachers. We're businessmen. I think we better just stay here tonight. We'll make camp, get an early start in the morning. [ Hooting ] May-- maybe we should take our business - someplace else, pa. - Yeah, pa. How a man as brave and smart as I am could end up with two sons as scared and as stupid as you is beyond me. Now we're gonna camp here. Take off that stuff and start setting up. I have spoken. - Yes, pa. - Yes, pa. He has spoken. I have taken my pack off. [ Mouth harp twanging ] Melvin: Mmm. Them's mighty good beans, pa. I cooked them beans. I sure do like the cooking chore, pa. Will you stop that infernal noise and get to bed? Both of you. I'll stay up here and keep watch for a while. - Okay, pa. - Okay, pa. Good night, pa. - Good night, Floyd. - Good night, pa. - Good night, Melvin. - Good night, Melvin. Good night, Floyd. Good night, ghost man. Will you shut up and get to bed?! [ Passes gas ] [ Sizzling ] [ Pa yawning ] [ Howling ] Man: Get out of my forest. Who's out there? I'm the one telling you to leave my animals alone and get out now, old man. I do-don't know who you are, b-but you ain't s-scaring me. [ Shouting ] [ Chanting ] [ Screaming ] [ Chanting ] Gosh, goldy, I really don't want to go home and tell uncle ned and Franklin about miss barley's old bicycle. They worry bad enough about money being short. They're not gonna like this. Help! It's the ghost man! Help! Help! Ghost man! [ Whimpering ] Them ghost man stories, - they're true. - The ghost man! - Ghost man! - Sheriff, ghost man! Ghost man! Come on, goldy. Let's go see what happened. - Ghost man! - Oh, it was awful. It was the ghost man! It was the most terrible thing I've ever heard. Sounded like he was 100 feet tall. Had a voice that cut clean through to your gizzard. Now what were you boys doing out there trapping? Now you know it's illegal this time of the year. You were poaching. We were, sheriff. I confess. We truly were. But I swear on my grandma's old gray head, we ain't never gonna do it again. Are we, Melvin? No we're not, sheriff. - Are we, Floyd? - No we ain't, pa. Don't tell me. Get down here and tell the sheriff. No we ain't, sheriff. There's something awful living up there. It ain't human. It's the ghost man, that's for sure. - Melvin: For sure. - Floyd: That's for sure. The ghost man. Those stories are true, goldy. The ghost man is living on our mountain. Now don't you chicken out on me, goldy. We're gonna find that old ghost man. [ Grunts ] [ Chittering ] [ Caws ] I'm thinking we're gonna be real busy, goldy. We got to get our act ready for the town carnival and find the ghost man. If we can find the ghost man, those kids at school will just fall over in fear. They'll be way too scared to ever track the ghost man. But not me. I know all about ghosts and other world mysteries. [ Grunts ] [ Shouting ] Goldy, run! [ Caws ] - Raven, what's wrong with you? - [ Caws ] It wasn't cruel of me to frighten that little girl. She shouldn't be out in the woods this time of night. - It's dangerous. - [ Caws ] Yes yes, I know she's only a child and I may have frightened her and possibly stunted her growth. - [ Caws ] - But that great golden bear should never have been so afraid. It's a loss of his natural power and that's not good. - [ Caws ] - Well, I'm glad we agree on that point. Now what are we gonna have for dinner? - [ Caws ] - All right, follow me. Yoo-hoo, Franklin. Greetings, ned. Whoa. - Franklin. - Greetings, belle. I hope I'm not late. Why ned, you old goat. Didn't you tell Franklin that you invited me over for supper? I'm sure glad you're here, belle. Why don't you come on in? I just got through making some hogshead soup. Franklin: Goldy, you can't sit at the table tonight. So I put some hot soup in your bowl outside. That's a girl. How come you were so late getting home tonight, Jessie? Um, well... Goldy and i-- never mind, you wouldn't believe me anyway. Come on. Go ahead, tell US. What? Well, we went up to the forest and we saw the ghost man. Oh, come on. Not that again. We did. If goldy was here she's tell you. Now Jessie, goldy is an animal. She's a big animal. There just isn't room for her at the dinner table. That's because you're sitting in her seat. If it means so much to you, why don't you have her sit in that chair right over there that's empty? Because she always sits next to Franklin. [ Goldy howls ] Oh, poor goldy. She really loves a good dinner conversation. Jessie, you know how goldy gets possessive of me anytime belle's around. So it's better that we put her outside. Did you see the beautiful pie that belle baked for US? Would-- would you look at that? - [ Laughing ] - That bear is eating my pie. - Franklin. - Franklin: Goldy. Save US a couple of slices. I was wondering if you'd care to join me at the town carnival that's coming up. I'd love to. And thanks again for supper. [ Laughs ] Gosh, goldy. Sorry you had to see that. Come on, let's go. It's past your bedtime. [ Piano playing ] And now with the aid of my assistant Hugo, I will amaze and astound you. Hugo. You are completely under my power. You will do exactly as I say. And now, ladies and gentlemen, defying the laws of gravity, I will make my assistant levitate and float high above you. Hugo, rise! [ Piano playing ] [ Woman laughs ] Rise, Hugo! [ Piano plays ] [ Murmuring ] Rise! Rise! Rise, Hugo. Rise, Hugo. [ Murmuring ] I told you never to eat before the performance. But sir, I only had the salad plate. Rise, Hugo. And now for my next trick. - Free beer over here. - Free beer. [ Gagging ] [ Gagging continues ] [ Exhales ] [ Gagging continues ] [ Gagging continues ] [ Audience booing ] Thank you and good night. [ Audience jeering ] - [ Booing ] - Get off the stage. Hold on. We got to talk. That's it for you two. Borgia is washed up. Nothing but a shaky has-been. How dare you speak of master borgia with such effrontery. He is the premier prestidigitator of the world's stages. He has performed for the crown royals of every civilized nation. - Why even now he-- - yeah yeah, I know. Even now he expects to be summoned by the king of siam to perform before the crown royals of Bangkok. Pfft. Balderdash. He's been selling that old story as long as I can remember. Tell me, how is he gonna keep a king happy when he can't even keep a third-rate audience watching? Huh? [ Coughs ] Master borgia is a very high-strung emotional genius. If he feels the audience to be hostile nonbelievers, he falters and cannot perform. He can only perform for those who truly love magic, not those who come for a freak show. [ Chuckles ] You're still fired. And I want you out tonight. - [ Knocking ] - Who is it? - [ Door opens ] - Hugo. Ah yes, Hugo. Come in. Has the telegram arrived with our invitation from the king of siam yet? Not yet, sir. But soon. Yes, soon. Well, i-- I thought the show went rather well tonight. Just lost concentration there for a minute. Ah. But tomorrow will be different. Sir, our engagement here has ended. Oh, our booking is up already, huh? Well, where do we go next? Paris? Barcelona? Uh, well, there's been a delay. [ Sighs ] I know I've been fired, Hugo. There's no need to pretend otherwise. They don't understand. I'm behind the times, Hugo. My magic is not enough. I need to create a new illusion-- something wondrous, something extraordinary. I wouldn't worry so, sir. Your concentration will return. Hugo. I think that maybe I have just enough magic left in me to try to contact our old friend crystalinas. But she hasn't spoken to you in years. [ Sighs ] Hopefully tonight will be different. Crystalinas, come to US here tonight and reveal to me the path of our future. I think she's coming, master. What do you see? A sign. Calhoon corners. It's the name of a small town in the midst of a delightful carnival. And there's a wonderful bear, a golden bear performing on a stage with a small child. What does it mean? It is a sign. Yes, a golden bear. I shall teach it to do wondrous magical tricks. An animal act? Mere spectacle. Your gifts are much more refined. I want that bear. And with the creation of my most fabulous illusion of all time, the world will once again be in awe of master borgia. And to all those who have laughed at me and mocked me, I say ba-ha! - Not too bad. - Last bullet went a little low. What are you doing here? Why aren't you on your way to school? Well, there's something I have to tell you. What did she do now? Not a darn thing. Well... Goldy just went for a little spin on a bicycle. And miss barley scared her and goldy crashed into a tree and sort of wrecked the bicycle. That wouldn't be the bicycle that is miss barley's pride and joy? It might have been. Jessie, that bike's gonna cost money to repair. And that's money we don't have. Well, maybe you can fix it. You're good with your hands. Yeah, maybe I can. But I'll tell you, that doesn't make what goldy did any less serious. I'll tell you, with the size of her a lot of people are getting scared of her. - They think she might be dangerous. - Dangerous? That's the most silliest thing I've ever heard. All right, listen. You tell miss barley I'll take care of the bike. But goldy is not going to school today. She's staying here. But goldy loves to visit me at school. Well, not today. Now you get going. Run along. Hey! What do you got those boots around your shoulder for? Oh, these? Miss barley told me I have to wear shoes to school. So I brought these for when I get there. All right, well, you do what miss barley says. All right, uncle ned. I'd better get going before goldy gets up. She don't like to be left behind. [ Caws ] [ Grunts ] [ Grumbling ] Oh, it's you. Jessie's already gone to school. She told me about that bicycle. You're not gonna be going to school for a while. Can't be responsible for you busting up other people's property. [ Grunts ] Now get out of here. Stupid bear. Sometimes I wish you were never here. [ Eagle screeches ] [ Wood scraping ] [ Scraping ] - [ Grunts ] - [ Laughs ] My my, goldy. Is that a new bonnet? [ Caws ] [ Children chatting ] Are those your uncle ned's boots? Looks more like goldy's. I'm gonna put a spell on you. You couldn't put a spell on anyone. Yes I can. The ghost man taught me how. [ Raven cawing ] I see you've been spying again. Oh, so you've taken a special interest in the child and the bear. You think she and I have much in common? Oh, I doubt that. She's but a child with a bear who she turned into a pet. - [ Caws ] - That's true. We both love animals. And we both love freedom. Go. [ Cawing ] [ Horse nickers ] [ Sniffs ] Ah! Ah! Hugo. Hugo. [ Coughing ] Borgia: Close one. Hyah. Hyah, get up. - Whoa there. - [ Whinnies ] Greetings, my fellow traveler. How may we assist you? Why you and your sidekick there can start by handing me over all your money. But we don't have any money. [ Laughs ] Well, I'll be. Driving around in a fancy rig like this and you say you're broke? What do I look like, a fool? On the contrary, my friend. I can see that you are a very learned man and can fully appreciate what I am about to give you. That's more like it. Hand it over here. Huh-uh-uh. Patience, my friend. First I want you to look deeply into this diamond's rare facets. Your eyes are growing very tired. You will now do exactly as I say. [ Echoing ] I am giving you all our money. It is more money than you have ever had. You are putting it in your pocket. And now say, "thank you, sir," tip your hat and ride away. Thank you, sir. [ Exhales ] Very nice piece of work, sir. My powers-- my powers are returning, Hugo. It is a sign, a message from the unknown that-- yes. Yes, I must find this golden bear. This golden bear is the holy grail to magicians, a key to the unknown that will dazzle the crowds that have stayed away from me for far too long. Master borgia has returned. Sir, your powers have always been present. You are the greatest illusionist of the century. No, Hugo. It is the golden bear that is causing this. This is my destiny, my future, my last hope. [ Clicks ] Franklin: I brought you this. Oh. Franklin, it's so pretty. Well, I thought since goldy ruined your bonnet, that this was appropriate. It was kind of cute what she did, wasn't it? Well-- well, maybe you think so. If you could have seen the way she looked with your clothes wrapped around her when I opened that door... Franklin, don't you see that she's being mean to me? I mean, every time that I'm around her she's trying to do something to upset me. She's just a little jealous is all. Well, she's not the only one. - You mean Jessie? - Mm-hmm. [ Sighs ] Jessie's just not used to having another woman around. Ned and I have been the only ones that have raised her ever since ned's sister passed away. Franklin, you know I love Jessie and even that undisciplined bear. But maybe now is not the right time to be bringing another woman into their lives. I hope you'll understand when I say I think we should wait. No. No, I don't want to wait. I'll talk to them. I know they care deeply about you. Goldy, come here. We've got to talk. Yes, we've got to talk. You've been a bad girl lately. I've grown to expect better things from you, but lately you've been just downright ornery. Yes you have. I know it's-- oh. And I don't like to scold you either, goldy. Usually you're so good. But I've got enough trouble with Jessie being mean to miss belle. And if I have it from you too I just don't know what I'll do. Oh, I know you're sorry. Come on, let's shake on that. You're gonna be a good girl, right? Aw, I love you too. I know that great golden bear deep down inside still remembers what it means to be free. I think there's hope, little buddy. I think there's hope. Look at those people fixing to have their carnival right now. And they don't even know what mean ugly thing lives up there on that mountain, pa. Well, Melvin, you know what your granny always said: The only truly happy people in this world are the truly stupid. I don't know, pa. I'm always happy when I'm cooking. You're stupid. Wish you wouldn't kick me so much, pa. It ain't your fault you're stupid. You take after your dear departed mama, god rest her soul. She was a good cook too. Yes she was, but she was stupid. Pa. It's okay, Melvin. You're stupid too. Thank you very much, pa. Excuse me. [ Playing harmonica ] Stop that, Floyd. You're giving me a headache. Dang, I don't believe what my eyes are seeing. What are they seeing, pa? You see that fella over there? Which fella? The short one? No, the big'UN with the hat wearing those pelts and chewing that tobaccy. That's rocky mountain Jack. Yeah, I see him, pa. Ain't that the fella you told US about, pa? The one that doesn't talk? Anytime he wants something he just growls like a grizzly bear? That's the one. He ain't been out of the mountains in over 20 years. I wonder what he's doing here? Maybe he's in town for the big shootout. I'll tell you, Melvin, if he is the folks in calhoon corners can just kiss that pot of gold goodbye 'cause if old rocky mountain Jack is half as good a shot as he used to be, he's gonna be heading right up the mountain with that pot of gold. And that's for sure. - That's for sure. - That's for darn sure. [ Playing harmonica ] - Boo! - [ Screams ] What's the matter? See a ghost? Why you little whippersnappers. If you'd seen what I'd seen you'd be six feet under, full heart stoppage. Now we're getting tired of you folks doubting our word. What's the matter? Afraid to go in the woods anymore? Afraid a bear might eat you? Young scalawag, we ain't afraid of nothing. As a matter of fact, to prove it, me and my boys, we're gonna go back up in the mountains and we're gonna haul out the biggest and meanest bear on the face of this earth. If you do, watch out for the ghost man. - Ah! - Ghost man. I'll get you. We gonna do that, pa? - I guess we got to. - Oh, pa. [ Laughing ] Whoa. "Welcome to calhoon corners. The town that loves magic." I think we've come to the right place, master. Yes, Hugo. I think you are right. - Is everything secure, Hugo? - Yes, master. Excellent. I think we've come to the right place. Yes. Yes, Hugo. I can sense that the great golden bear is very near. We have only to make some discreet inquiries, find out where the bear is kept, who is the owner and what will be the price. But master, our funds are very limited. At the risk of sounding common, I have to remind you we are flat broke. Hugo, how many times must I remind you that wealth is just an illusion? But master, we'll need real money to buy the bear. By sleight of hand and twist of fate, master borgia will baffle, bewilder and bewitch all comers. The magic show will now begin. I introduce to you the great, the one and only, master borgia! [ Applause ] Hugo, we will be looking for donations today. Ah, mademoiselle. [ Laughs ] Salabim. Salabam. Oh, thank you. - Wow. - Ooh! Woman: How did he do that? Oh no. What's he doing? - [ Crowd laughing ] - Woman: Oh my. [ Laughing ] Woman: Can you imagine? Amazing. [ Applause ] Miss barley: Now today's recitation is going to be Lincoln's gettysburg address. Everybody... All: Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Girl: There's a magic show in town! - [ Clamoring ] - Children! Children, stop this instant! Children: Oooh. No one loves a magic show more than I do. - Let's go! - [ Cheering ] Come on. Let's go, kids. Excuse US. Sorry. Oh. [ Crowd gasps ] You, madam. Would you please assist me? No, I can't. Children, no. Oh please, miss barley. It could be very educational. - Well, I don't-- all right. - Go, miss barley. What is your name, please? Um, miss barley. Miss barley, yes. I am sensing another miss barley. - A woman who loves nature. - Yes. - Who loves to be wild. - Yes. - And free. - Yes. - And in love. - Yes. - You love flowers. - Yes. - And poetry. - Yes. - And howling at the moon. - [ Howls ] [ Children laugh ] - You are a temptress, miss barley. - Yes. No. Be free, miss barley. - Oh! - [ Children laughing ] I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. I'm free. Girl: Goodbye, miss barley. [ Horse whinnies ] [ Gunshot ] [ Gunshot ] [ Horse whinnies ] [ Gunshot ] You been out here practicing all day? Yeah I have, and boy I'll tell ya, it has really paid off. I have not missed a bull's-eye all day. You know, I really think I'm gonna win this thing. What's the matter with you? Nothing. Nothing's the matter with me. - It's just-- - come on, Franklin. I can tell when something's wrong. Spit it out. Well, I was in town this morning. You know, I was helping out with old Olsen. You know how he's always forgetting about putting in our orders on time? Remember that time he forgot to get the gingham in for Jessie-- Franklin, what is wrong? Spit it out. Tell me. [ Sighs ] - I saw rocky mountain Jack. - Oh. And he's planning to sign up for the shooting match, that's all. That's all? That's all? Rocky mountain Jack is entering the shooting contest and you say that's all? I might as well stay home at the ranch. Didn't you just tell me that you've been hitting bull's-eyes all day long? - Yeah. - Right? A bull's-eye is a bull's-eye. That's the best anybody can do. You're as good as rocky mountain Jack. Yeah, you're probably right. Just I've got so many things on my mind, you know? I have got to win this pot of gold. I've got the mortgage on the ranch due. We don't have any supplies. You know what I reckon we ought to both do? We ought to both stop worrying. I think you're right. Let's do get 'em. Melvin: Hey, pa. Will you wait up? No, boys, we've got to keep moving. We've got the family good name to be thinking of. Come on, pa, it's getting dark out. You can't hunt bears in the dark, now can you? Hey, pa, can I just stay back at the cabin? I'll cook US up a mess of beans. No, we've got to stay up there in them woods till we come back with a bear. I have spoken. [ Laughs ] Your eyes are very sharp, sir. Would you care to try your luck again? [ Grunts ] Yeah. - Ah. - [ Laughs ] Another winner. Hugo, give the man his silver dollar. Hugo. Sir, this is not magic. This is sleight of hand-- a con game. Nonsense, Hugo. This man is ned's main competition in the shooting contest. I need to have him in my debt. There you go. Well sir, you have won a great deal of money. Allow me once more chance to try to earn it back. - Yeah. - Very well. Let's play for some real stakes. I will bet everything I own-- my horse, my wagon-- in exchange for your potential winnings tomorrow at the shooting contest. Yeah. Very well. [ Laughs ] [ Grunts ] [ Laughs ] - Jessie: The magician was fantastic. - Oh really? His magic was so good I couldn't see no strings or nothing. He wasn't faking any of that stuff he was doing. Someday goldy and me are going to be in an act like that. And then he hypnotized the folks so that they thought they were chickens and dogs and even bees. But best of all, he hypnotized old miss barley and she went running out into the fields picking flowers. She never came back so we got the whole afternoon for recess. - [ Laughs ] - [ Knocking at door ] Who'd come calling this late at night? Maybe it's miss belle coming over with another pie. [ Roars ] All right, come on, goldy. You know miss belle needs to sit in this chair. Come on. Go lie on your bed. That's a good girl. That's a good girl. Do you believe in magic? [ Wolf howling ] And my travels have taken me many many times around the world, in fact more times than the ancients have sailed to the moon. [ Chuckles ] And now after all these years, I am ready for my grandest illusion of all time. And I want all of you to help me. How can we help you? I need goldy, the last golden bear. Now wait a minute. What do you mean you need the bear? For my master illusion. And I am prepared to pay a substantial sum and payments as she continues to assist me with my magic. You will never have to worry about money again. Goldy's part of the family. Selling her would be like selling off Franklin. - Well, thanks, Jessie. - Hold on, borgia. I don't mean to be rude, but the bear's not for sale. I see. Well, Hugo, the hour is late. We must go. Once again I thank you for your generous hospitality. And I bid you good night. I want you to sell me the bear tonight. [ Stammers ] No, the bear's not for sale. I told you, the bear is not for sale. Hmm. A man of strong character. [ Groans ] Fare thee well. I am off to fly with the bats and howl with the wolves. Sleep well and safe. [ Laughs ] Hugo! Hyah! He would never try to steal goldy, would he? Stop fretting, will you, Jessie? And go get some sleep. You got a big performance with goldy tomorrow. I think we all should get some sleep. If I don't win that contest tomorrow, I might have to sell goldy. What do you mean sell goldy? You can never sell goldy. She's not yours to sell. [ Echoing ] She's free! Maybe raven was right. The little girl and I are alike. We like real freedom. Your performances today were exquisite. I haven't seen your magic this powerful in a long time. It is the presence of the last golden bear. She is my good luck charm. I need her. Maybe it's just that you believe in the golden bear and so once again believe in yourself. Tomorrow. I must succeed in purchasing the bear tomorrow. Now ned is counting heavily on winning this shooting match. Now if he should lose, he won't have the pot of gold in order pay his debts and he'll need another source of income. But he's confident. His shot is very accurate. What if he doesn't lose? Ah, but what if he does? [ Tisks ] [ Clicks ] [ Rooster crows ] Isn't this fun, goldy? Come on, goldy. Push me up. I wish we could rig this trapeze at the carnival, goldy. Oh well. I guess we'll have to wait to join the circus to be able to perform in public. Ta-da! Hey, goldy, watch this. Backflip. Goldy, I can't wait for those kids at the carnival to see US. Boy, that was really professional, Jessie. Why'd you sleep in the barn last night? I just wanted to be sure that goldy was all right. Aw, Jessie. You don't have to worry about master borgia coming back and stealing your bear. If he was that type of person he wouldn't have tried to buy her. I think he's an awful sort of person, asking to buy someone's best friend like they were a barrel of apples. Don't worry about it, Jessie. He's not gonna be back. Uncle ned, you would never sell goldy, would you? Honey, it's like you said, she's not mine to sell. She's free. Now come on, let's go get ready for the carnival. Franklin, is it all right if goldy and me go to town ahead of you so we can practice our act? Sure. Belle: Yoo-hoo. Oh no, is she coming to the carnival too? Yes she is. And I want you to be nice to her. But she makes my nerves all jangly. And I feel like screaming when her voice comes out. Well, her voice sounds like melody to me. And Jessie, I think it's time you-- well, I think it's time I told you. I asked miss belle to be my wife and she said yes. Franklin, shh. Don't let goldy hear you say that till after the performance today or she'll be so upset and heartbroken she won't do a darn trick. All right. Promise you'll be nice? All right. Morning, miss belle. It surely is a fine day today. Yes, it is. Thank you. Thank you. Mommy mommy, look at the monkey. [ Crowd laughs ] Aren't you excited, goldy? We get to do our act for the whole town. And well, pretty soon we'll be so good and so famous we'll travel all over the world performing. What do you care about old Franklin for anyway? Anyone can fall in love and get married. But can anyone join the circus? - Hmm? - [ Grunts ] Ah. I see that ned and his unusual family have finally arrived. I need to get to him before the shooting match commences. Excuse me, mister. When's the magic gonna start? Yes well, there will be no more magic today. My performances yesterday were all I had planned for my stay here in rustic calhoon corners. Now run along. Poof, you're gone! No more magic? Gee whizz. Master borgia, nobody loves magic like the folks of calhoon corners. Sir, if I may. You've never said no to magic before. It is unheard of. Yes, but I must concentrate all my powers on the golden bear. - But sir, it's magic. - Enough! My performances in calhoon corners were for one day only. Gee, I thought magicians always wanted to do magic. So did I. [ Drum roll ] Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the acrobatic wonders of me, Jessie and goldy. [ Applause ] [ Caws ] [ Gasps ] [ Applause ] - Woman: Can you do that? - Man: Looks like a little spider. - Great. - Oh, she's terrific. Oh yay. She's great. Wonderful. wonderful. [ Drum roll ] [ Crowd gasps ] [ Applause ] [ Whistles ] [ Caws ] Oh, time is running out. I haven't been able to get close enough to cast a single spell on my dear friend ned. At this rate he'll win that pot of gold and my dreams will be dashed. Sir, you know that throughout our many years together I have never once questioned your judgment and that I have long professed my belief that you are the most talented illusionist of the century. - But-- - at last, the chance I have been waiting for. I cannot watch you do this. [ Grunts ] [ Laughs ] Rocky mountain smell. Ah, greetings, my dear friend. I had hoped to run into you today to ascertain whether I had said something last night that offended you in any way. Oh, borgia, I understand. You're a businessman. You came out there to do business. Au contraire. I am an artist. I wish merely to make art. But see it how you will. You see, art is very important to me. You'll notice that I carry this exquisite crystal with me at all times. Now, ned, you have a shooting match to go to. But your arms are getting very very heavy. So heavy in fact that you cannot keep your gun up. But don't worry about losing that pot of gold because I have some money to give you anyways. Now, ned, go to your shooting match, but remember your arms are very very heavy. My arms are very heavy. Yes. Now go. Go. A simple spell but really quite elegant. [ Chuckles ] Hugo. Hugo. Hugo. Hugo. [ Chuckles ] Hugo. Where are you going? With deepest regrets I must say I am leaving you. I cannot serve you any longer. But what are you talking about? Dear sir, you have lost your love for magic. [ Gunshots ] Oh, Hugo, quickly, the match has started. We must not miss a single shot. [ Laughs ] Goodbye, my friend. Welcome to the annual calhoon corners carnival. I want you all to give a big round of applause to Mr. Cornwall peabody of the Kensington firearms company... [ Applause ] Who is making this here contest possible. Now Mr. Peabody's company is furnishing the pot of gold which will go to the winner of this here shooting match. [ Sighs ] Blah blah blah. Let's get to the shooting. Next up we got sort of a living legend around here-- rocky mountain Jack. [ Women shriek ] Uncle ned's an a-number-one shot. He's gonna scare that old rocky mountain Jack right back into the hills. [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ] Woman: I'd hate to see him win. [ Gunshot ] [ Laughs ] Woman: Ah. Ew. [ Grunts, growls ] Looks like Jack's the man to beat. But I'm betting that our own calhoon corners ned is just the competition that'll take the pot of gold. [ Applause ] Something's really wrong with ned. Ned, what's the matter with you? I don't know, Franklin. My arms are just so heavy. I don't even think I can pick this rifle up. Here, let me help you. Put your arm up. Okay. You got it? Okay. - We'll give her a try. - All right. Franklin: Come on, ned. [ Crowd cheering ] [ Cheering ] I must think of a way to stop this nightmare. [ Cheering ] If he misses this one we lose the ranch. [ Crowd groans ] What if he really did mean he'd sell goldy if he lost the shooting match? Uncle ned would never do that. [ Laughing ] Ah, thank you, my friend. Huh? It is so good to do business with you. - [ Grunting ] - You are a gentleman and you smell very badly. Thank you. [ Grunting ] [ Whimpers ] Mama. Ah, ned. Just the man I've been looking for. I have this gold for you. Do you want it? Oh no, he's doing it. I don't believe he's doing it, goldy. Uncle ned is selling you to the magician. Here you are. Come on, goldy, we've got to get out of here right now. You are taking this money in exchange for the last golden bear. Yes. Very good. Come on, goldy. In here. We already told you goldy's not for sale. But your friend here wants to sell. Look, I don't know what you've done to him but he couldn't sell you goldy anyway. She's her own person. She's free. So go on, get out of here. Scram. Ned? Ned? [ Snaps ] Snap out of it, ned. Come here, goldy. Goldy, we've got to get out of here. Come on, hurry. Now stay down, goldy. I don't want anyone to see US leave. - [ Goldy grunts ] - Hey! Hey, where are you going with my bear? Wait! Wait, stop! You have my bear. Come back! You can't have goldy. I won't let you. [ Grunts ] Stop! My bear! [ Crowd muttering ] Why'd you scare Jessie and goldy like that? Did you use your magic to scare them? Use my magic to scare children? [ Chuckles ] No, never. Maybe magic's bad. No, magic is not bad. Magic is wonderful. Then why were they so afraid of you? Come on, guys, let's go find them. I have done something very wrong. And now I must make it right. Shazzam! Franklin. Howdy, ned. Belle. A woman's work is never done. Ned, you're back. Ned, listen to me. - Jessie's run off with goldy. - Why? Because she saw you trying to sell goldy to that borgia character. - When did I do that? - Right after you lost the shooting match. I lost? I lost? It's gonna be way too hard for anybody to follow US into these rocks. And besides, they're gonna be way too scared to follow US into the ghost man's lair. [ Caws ] - They still free? - [ Caws ] - You must keep a close eye on them. - [ Caws ] Children and animals are the world's innocent. They know nothing of evil. Go. [ Laughing ] You know, goldy, I hope we do find the ghost man and that he doesn't try to scare US again. I'd like to become his friend. Then we can live up here and practice our circus act. And then when we're grown up enough we can join the circus and travel all over the world. [ Laughs ] Can't we go back to town now? We ain't going back till we bag ourselves a bear. Come on, pa. We got to go back home now. Come on, we've been out here too long. No we ain't. We're gonna get ourselves a bear. We still got time. If we're lucky, we'll find that old bear, shoot him - and be back in town for sunset. - I'd like that, pa. I don't think I could take another night out here. One more night in this mountain, pa, and I'd be nuttier than squirrel bait. Right now you're dumber than a whole pile of rocks. Come on. - Where is that bear? - Is that a bear track? No, that's my track. Got to be around here somewhere. All right, goldy, that's enough playing. Let's go. You know, some of these trails were made by Indians in their moccasins. I'd sure like a pair of them instead of regular old shoes. Hmm. It's gonna be dark in about an hour. We should probably find a place to sleep for the ni-- goldy. Darn it, goldy. Where did you go? Goldy! Goldy, where did you go? We don't have time for you to get lost. Darn it, goldy. You know, I think they probably headed up for the mountains. I really want to thank you guys for helping US out on this search. I'm sure we'll find 'em. If I may, I would like to join your search party. See, it is my fault that the girl and the bear are missing. And if you will accept my deepest apologies and give me a chance to make amends I would be forever grateful. Apology accepted, borgia. And of course you can join the search. We can use your help. Thank you. Dang! Down down down! Who's got the bullets? I got the bullets, pa. - You got the bullets? - Yeah. - No, I got the bullets. - You got the bullets. Pa: Good good. - [ Hoots ] - Pa: Not that way. The other way. Okay okay, pa. Where'd he go? I don't know, pa. Where'd he go? - Shh shh. - Okay. There's his track. There it is. Oh oh. Boys, don't breathe. The bear will hear you. [ Horse whinnies ] - [ Goldy grunts ] - What was that? - Ahh! - [ Roars ] [ Gunshots ] Oh no. Goldy! [ Panting ] Goldy! Are you all right, goldy? Where are you? Goldy! Help! Ghost man! Help! Oh god. Come on. Pa! Move, pa! Ghost man! Over there! Over there! Hey! ghost man! - [ Pa sobbing ] - Whoa! Ghost man! Whoa! Whoa whoa! Come on, pa. I got ya. Come on. Come on. Come on, pa. Whoa, hey. Ghost man. He's here. [ Stammering ] - We saw the bear. - Hold on. What happened? [ Blubbering ] We-- we saw it ourselves. A bear and... [ Blubbering ] And then ghost man came after US. You boys better clear out of here. Borgia: You fools! You shot the last golden bear. - You shot goldy. - [ Blubbering ] What have I done, Hugo? You were right. I have forgotten my magic and look what has happened. All right, listen up. Listen up. It's gonna be dark soon. Borgia, take those two guys over to the south mountain. Franklin, you and I will go up over this Ridge. Let's go. [ Exhaling ] [ Groans ] Raven, she's all right. [ Caws ] Jessie: Goldy, are you all right? - What happened? - She fainted. The gunshots frightened her terribly. She's lucky to be alive. Hey, it's getting late. You shouldn't be in the woods by yourself. So come on. Maybe you should come with me. Come on, goldy. [ Horse whinnies ] [ Crickets chirping ] It's getting warm here. Hmm, here's another one of my little buddies. Oh, he's so cute. Can I hold him? Sure. So you're the ghost man? I knew I'd find you. Well, that's what people call me. I let them think I'm a ghost. That way it frightens off the poachers and the bad people. At least most of the time. So what can I call you? - Freedom. - That's a strange name. Yeah, I know. You see, my parents were runaway slaves and they came to live in the mountains with these Indians. The Indians let me choose my own name. And I chose freedom-- freedom for all animals and people. So why do you love animals so much? Why do you? 'Cause animals just want to be happy. They're never mean or ornery. They just want to wake up every day and live. - [ Chuckles ] - They're never bossy. - Mm-hmm. - They never tell lies and they don't steal. - They're just happy. - Is goldy always happy? Oh yeah. Well... Lately she's been awful sad. That don't seem right. Animals always should be happy. Yeah, the sad part is she's in love with Franklin. And Franklin's a man and she's a bear. - Hmm. - And the problem with that is - she's the last of her kind. - No she's not. - She's not? - No. Over on the mountain on the other side, there's a male bear there. I'm sure he's looking for a mate. But, I'm afraid goldy would never be able to live in the wild again. Why? Goldy lost her fear for humans. And that fear almost got her killed today. It's all my fault. No no no no. It's not your fault. You're only a child and you act from the heart. You have no guilt. So do you think I should let goldy go? I see you really love goldy. So I'm gonna leave that decision up to you. If goldy learned to be wild again, would you help US find the other golden bear? Sure I will. Remember, if you ever need me again I'll be there for you and goldy. [ Birds chirping ] Freedom? Freedom? Freedom? Goldy, you're awake. He's gone. Jessie, thank goodness you're all right. We've been worried sick. Franklin, I found her. She's over here. Uncle ned. Franklin. Oh, I'm so glad you're all right. And goldy. Goldy, the trappers said that they had shot you. No, she just fainted because of the gunfire. Weren't you afraid up here all by yourself? I wasn't alone. I know, you had goldy. No, I was with the ghost man. Jessie, are you gonna try and get US to believe that story again? But it's true. His name's freedom and he loves animals just as much as I do. All right. All right. Let's just go home. I thought you sold goldy to that mean magician. Won't he come back for her? No, ned was just tricked. He didn't sell goldy. Franklin stopped me in time. - Let's go. - Okay. - Come on, goldy. - Come on, goldy. Come on. Salabim. Salabam. Presto. [ Children gasp ] [ Laughs ] Hugo: He will baffle, bewilder and bewitch you. Hugo. Oh, Hugo, I have made some terrible mistakes. Can you ever forgive me? Of course, sir. I forgot all about magic. I was under a spell of my own making, blind to everything that I love in life. I was consumed with this terrible drive toward ego and power. Oh, how close we can come to losing ourselves forever. But you're back now, sir, and that's what counts. Yes. Yes, I am back. And my powers have never been stronger. And now I want to do something for Jessie and goldy. - A gift? - Yes. Yes, a gift. Come, Hugo. Oh no. That magician's back. He's not gonna pull any of his old tricks this time. Go on, get out of here. Jessie, hold on. Hold on. Borgia's not after goldy anymore. He's had a change of ways. Then what are you doing here? Well, it was not right that you lost the shooting match. So I came to give you this. Hugo. Go on, take it. It's rightfully yours. You would have won the match if I hadn't put the spell on you. You don't know what this means to US. Now we can save the ranch. Thank you. Borgia: I had better be going then. Master borgia, wait. Do you think you could put a spell on goldy? A spell? What kind of spell? See, goldy can't survive in the forest anymore. She's forgotten all about being a wild bear. Could you help her remember? Well, I think I can help you. Through a form of hypnosis I can unlock goldy's deepest memories. She will remember what it is to be a bear and then she can live in the forest. Is this what you want? I want goldy to be happy. Until now I thought she was the last of her kind. But freedom told me that there's another golden bear. And if they mate they could start a family. Yes. But you must remember, if I hypnotize her she will become wild. So I'd better put my spell on her at the edge of the forest. We're gonna need freedom for this. Franklin: Jessie. Jessie honey. Um, you know those stories about the ghost man? He'll come. Then you'll have to believe me. - [ Cawing ] - There's the raven. Oh, raven, would you please ask freedom to meet US at his rock and help me return goldy to the wild? I know he's awful shy of people, but well, I'm really gonna need his help. [ Caws ] Well, Jessie, why don't you spend one last night with goldy? And then in the morning we can take her to meet freedom. Okay. I know this is your favorite song. - [ Music playing ] - You know, goldy, me wanting you to be in the circus with me was kind of like master borgia wanting you to be in his act. Either way it's just not what you're supposed to be doing, at least not now. [ Sighs ] You can't just moon over Franklin forever. It's time you found yourself a mate. And besides, I think it's time I told you he's going to marry miss belle. Please don't be upset. Freedom says there's a great wonderful male golden bear in the forest. You know what? - [ Grunts ] - He's waiting for you. I love you, goldy. [ Horse whinnies ] [ Whinnies ] Master borgia. I'm looking for master borgia. You there, what do you wish of master borgia? I have an important telegram for him. I have instructions not to deliver it to anybody but master borgia. Master. I am master borgia. Finally. I've been looking for you for months. This here telegraph is for you. "The king of siam re-- the king of siam requests the immediate presence of master borgia and his incomparable assistant Hugo in Bangkok immediately. Your tickets are waiting for you at the consulate in San Francisco." Hugo, this is a miracle. I prefer to think of it as magic. Yes. Quickly. Quickly, we must help Jessie and goldy, and then on to Bangkok. [ Laughs ] Ned: Jessie, I really think we've taken up too much time of master borgia and Hugo here. I don't think he's gonna show up. He said he'd be here for whenever goldy and I needed him. If he promised to come I'm sure he will. Don't worry about US, ned. Whatever time it is, it is. What he really means is time is relative. Perhaps freedom is supposed to be late, thus he's actually on time. Uh-huh. [ Gasps ] There he is. - My gosh, he is real. - I told you he'd come. Master borgia, are you ready to cast your spell? Yes. Then let's help Jessie free her friend. Yeah well, I'm sure gonna miss you, hon. It's not gonna be the same without you. Goodbye, goldy. You find yourself a mate. You understand? Okay? I love you. Now, goldy, I want you to remember a long time ago before Jessie found you alone in the woods. Remember living with other bears. I want you to remember all the lessons your mother taught you. Now when Jessie tells you the phrase "return to the wilderness," you will forget what it was like to live in a house and eat at a table and ride a bicycle and wear silly hats, and you will remember what it is to be a bear in the wild. When you are ready to set her free repeat the phrase. Okay. Goldy, I know you won't remember anything about living like a person. [ Roars ] But I hope just a little bit of you will remember me just sometimes. 'Cause if I can think that, then I won't feel so lonely. Goldy, return to the wilderness. [ Grunts ] I'll never forget you, goldy. Never. Bye.
