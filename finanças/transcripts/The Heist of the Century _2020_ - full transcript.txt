Inspired by real facts Some events and characters are the fruits of fiction January 10, 2005 THE STEAL OF THE CENTURY Martial arts, plastic arts... all my activities... I want... to be... one thing. I want you to have a natural direction. A philosopher said... that the greatest good for the human being is to find a vocation. A truth that is authentic for a person. A truth for which you can also give life. So it would be important... hurry to find that vocation. It must not pass... it must not pass. Strength is not opposed and more strength, however, more technical. I have said this a thousand times: we are not opposed to the strength of a superior rival, we use it instead. Hand with hand. Bridge. - Saw? - Yes. Well. Come on. BANCO RIO Do you know what it takes to make a hole like that? Sebas, it's on the table. I'll be right there, love. What a witch! If it weren't for her, I don't know what would become of my life. I'm sure. What did you say? If it were another guy, I would say that you are crazy and that is an asshole. You're crazy, but you're not an asshole, so I'm the asshole I want to know what the fuck you want to get yourself into. You will need cars and tools, and I have no money. So you have to find a funder first. A funder... You are crazy. Where do I buy? The Lord is with you. - And with His spirit. - Gospel according to Saint John... At the moment, I don't have a weight. But, if I can help you, count on me. Does anyone come to mind? - Let us lift our hearts. - They are addressed to the Lord. - We give thanks to the Lord... - There's a guy. our God. It's good and right. It's good and sure to give thanks... As if I were going to Australia, my God! It's just a spit, I'm just going to Montevideo. For my poor mother to see grandchildren that I haven't seen in a long time. - Right. - She's very old, poor thing. Yes, grow old... - Yes... - And grunted... "Don't bring me the kids". "But mom, sometimes you can". - We have to take advantage... - That's right. - Well, I brought the money... - No, no. Pay me when we deliver the documentation. Just a few days. We check the data and it's all yours. Okay, but I already brought the 2,000 dollars. - I don't know now... - No, but it's 2,000 pesos! - What good news are you giving me! - But yes! - Got it wrong on the phone? - Did I tell you 2,000 dollars? - It was what I understood. - Sorry, it's not that expensive... My God, please don't... Too bad, I'm not going home now... I would not like to take this money with me, can i leave it with you? - If it's a problem, tell me... - No, no, no. - Can? Do me a big favor. - Yes. - No, imagine, it's nothing. - Really. - I'll leave them here. - I bring the 2,000 pesos. - Yes, and I'll give you the dollars back. - Please. Yes, they are yours. And tell me, have you been married for a long time? - Well that's. Take it here. - Yes, 500, yes. - Yes? - It's worth seeing... - Thanks. - Clear... If your father doesn't come... I never see you. Bye, kiss. I'm working... that's why. - How are you, taking care of yourself? - Very well. Everything perfect. It suits me very well. The law firm... I manage all interns with a steady hand, coming and going... Weren't they computers? Well, last year, yes. But it didn't work. - No way. - Unfortunately, nothing to do. Done. Great, this is perfect. And, Lu, when do we have dinner? - Tonight. Show up. - Tonight, I can't. Don't get in trouble, Dad. But what problems, now... No more problems. Love you. Me too. HAIRDRESSER Here it is! ELECTRICITY DANGER Say hi to Larin! Bye. God! My God... I'm out of breath. What a scare I got! I was also frightened. Look how I still tremble. Sorry, if I scared you too. - What's your name? - Carmen... and you... - I'm Enrique. Gutierrez. - Enrique. NO... No, because I'm new here. I started yesterday. I'm doing a task... They said to get everything ready for the signature tomorrow... I can't find Sananez's will anywhere. - Do you know where you can be? - No, I take care of the cleaning, not wills or anything. What bad luck... Why don't you call Dr. Rosa, she must know. So I’m going to last very little here! - Okay. - NO... Well, do your job, which I can handle. Bye, honey. It was a pleasure. - Carmen, bye. - How beautiful, Carmencita... - Enrique, he told me... - Gutierrez. The intern. If you ask, the intern came in the evening. - Right. - For the Sananez case. - Bye, honey. - Good luck. But where will it be... Sananez, Sananez... Hello, Mario. This is Fernando Ara ْ jo. Doc Debauza asked to call you for a job. I am in the car right now and you are entering a bar. I would like to talk with you. I hope you are not violent. If you can, we'll meet on Friday at the Via Flam nia nia ice cream shop. It's a public place, so that you can feel comfortable. I am not a psychopath. I'll be there at 5 pm. I apologize, if I bothered you... What's yours, idiot? Why are you following me? Who are you? Ara ْ jo. Fernando Ara ْ jo. What the fuck do you want? Do you have a gun? - Do you have a gun? - Don't worry, there is nothing. - No, nothing? - No. Don't mess with me, idiot! Want to fuck me? Fernando, do you want to fuck me? Want to fuck me? Marito, it's Doc. I gave your number to a friend. Good boy. Treat him well, something interesting is coming up. Tell me. Hello, Mario. This is Fernando Ara ْ jo. Doc Debauza asked to call you for a job. I am in the car right now and you are entering a bar. I would like to talk with you. I hope you are not violent. If you can, we'll meet on Friday at the Via Flam nia nia ice cream shop. It's a public place, so that you can feel comfortable. I am not a psychopath. I'll be there at 5 pm. I apologize, if I bothered you... What's yours, idiot? Hey, Fernandito. - Mario. - How are you? - Good? - Good. You haven't seen me in a long time. - Are you okay? - Yes Yes. - Your aunt? - Auntie, well. Good. Look, Fernandito, I work alone. I don't know why Doc talked about me. Because you are number one. It has a head... balls... and money. Have children? Mario, don't be offended by what I'm going to say, but do you know why you've been arrested so many times? No. - Tell me please. - Because you steal little. I don't run away. I am not a thief. - I'm a professional thief. - You're right. Each thing with its name. I propose something to you. One robbery... colossal. Can I show you something? But, at the cash register for customers, you don't have any money. The central bank determined that, once you have over 10,000 pesos, the cashier must deposit them in the underground vault. - Would you like? - No, no. The substantial part is in the safe, where the bank keeps the money that serves to open that day. Who imagined that banks kept in the safe the most profitable part! Well, where do you want to go to give me a little idea what do you want to tell me? You will see. Just a minute. What are you doing? Pants 41, right? We are 18 meters from being millionaires. Up here is Banco Rio. Does the tide get here? Yes, at two times of the day the tide is low. We started working on one and left on the other. But if there is a sudden rain, there is no signal here, how do you do it? We have to follow the weather forecast and come in only when the weather is nice. Not bad... not bad. Hi Lu. I knew it would happen. I'm out of my mind: I'm happy to have dinner with you, you know how loyal I am to punctuality, well... don't i fall into a hole in the middle of the sidewalk? Tell me, but can you believe something similar? - Terrible. - Right, vapt! And he swallows me! But look a little. - I made meat with mashed potatoes. - Yes good. - Yes, uselessly. - NO... I am going to sleep because tomorrow I work, I get up early. As for you, have your wine, relax, for that... No, Lu, don't be so angry, down a hole in the middle of Santa Fé Avenue, - what should I do... - Santa Fe, and what? - What... - Say, Santa Fe, and what? Well... the one with... Aona. Yes, Aona. - Santa Fe and Aona. - Yes. - Gaona. - Yes. See how I can't count on you? No, no, you can always count on me, please, I ask you. Did you smoke a joint? Do you sell drugs now? What's going on? Are you crazy? I'm not addicted anymore, what are you saying? You smell like marijuana! I already know. Yes, I will explain. No, we stop here. Enough. How could I? Lu? - Luciana? - Close the door when you leave. Well, let's make a hole and enter any room in the bank. All of these rooms have motion sensors. - Being the first thing... - The temperature. I installed the same system here, last week. And I already know how it works. The motion sensor does not identify movements, but... the temperature difference. Just a moment... It will be difficult to do... Where did that doll come from? Is he going to mass with you? Calm down, Mario, give him a chance. If you don't like what he shows, let's go. The guy is not an idiot. See? Wearing these costumes made of bags sleeping at high altitudes the sensor does not detect... body temperature, and does not trigger the alarm. Then we must enter the bank disguised like that, with sleeping bags? Yes. Yes. With these outfits, we can... walk... quietly across the bank without the movement triggering the alarm. - Quietly. - Quietly. And how do you plan to open the bank vault? Give me time for this. Now we need a bank plan. PARKING Please come with me, sir. - Okay. What is the reason? - Follow me. Honestly, I don't understand why. Because? What do you suspect? SECURITY DEPOSIT BOXES You are wrong, I was not taking pictures. I was looking at the menu. I wasn't taking a picture. Please, I'm an artist. This is all ridiculous. Well, I owe you an apology, sir. And who pays me for this embarrassment? - No, who pays me? - Nobody, sir. - It's our job, isn't it? - Good... I should now speak to the Human Rights Secretariat. - And, no... - Please don't make trouble. Blue print. There is a manhole here with the meter. Underground. The bank vault is here, around this time. And here, the safety boxes. Hundreds But our gateway... it will be this. Which is a small room where they stopped me: this place is perfect to enter. So... sewer depth, 18 meters. Now, what we need to know what is the distance between the manhole and the bank. You cannot stretch a meter on the street, has the security guardhouse - and the bank guard. - You're right. Let us think otherwise. 7 meters and 10 centimeters from the inspection well to the bank. 18 meters deep to the drainage channel. We have both sides of a triangle and so we can... find the hypotenuse. - The hypotenuse, what? - Go, go, go, go! Exact. The tunnel, from here to here, like this. Saw? And this angle, angle of inclination, is calculated with the tangent arc. Tangent arc: 2 year of Geometry. And this idiot, was he late in Geometry classes too? He was always the best in the class. Always with that shit, right? Shit, no, Mario. This is a sensory experience... yes? Everything you think about, or produce under cannabis it is the opposite of tension. - State cann’t spout. - Everything to the contrary. Look... that... sharpens my observation I smoke... and I get super concentrated. That's why I put you on a plan like this. If I hadn't smoked marijuana, this theft would not have the balance it has. Doesn't it make you talk? You do not notice but speak, speak, speak. When someone commits an immoral act, like robbing a bank, the more you think about the effects side that will produce with the greatest possible empathy and personal ethics, much better will be the consequent social reaction. This is how it is. Here no one will go hungry until the insurance is reimbursed. There will even be someone who will declare more than he had saved. There is no real damage here. The bank does lose, but people will be delighted. - Balance... - Natural. In short, listening to you, anyone wants to be robbed, seriously. Why don't you leave a message for the box holders, explaining all of that. They will be delighted. Now, I really want to know how you're going to open the safe. You continue with the natural balance and i keep waiting in vain? Tell me, just so I can get an idea. Sorry guys, I had to take Lolito to a birthday. I didn't want to stay. You made a fuss! Come on, because I'm afraid we won't reach that natural balance. Speak, speak, speak, speak! Here we are, we're here. - We should have more people. - Let's go to work, guys! - Do you see it? - Yes. - Sostienilo. - Yes. Oops! - Are you going to download it? - Yes. - Watch your cut! - Yes. How do you think about opening the box? With a lever, as before. - You are a romantic. - I don't know. I don’t know, after forcing the twentieth or thirtieth box, if lactic acid forms, muscles weaken, there is more chance of accidents. We have to find another way. What accident? We have 12 hours to open some boxes. If it were a weekend it would take more than 48 hours. And a blowtorch? It only takes a minute to open one. We calculate over 400 security boxes, with a torch it would be 1 minute, or 1 and a half minutes, per box. We will stay in the bank for 7 hours. It's a long time. It has to be faster. We need to study the lock. And how we study if none of us knows the safe. We have to rent a box. Doing this, they would have our data. Not at this agency, Mario, at another. - You'll want? - No, step. Finish that thing, make me die! - Mr. Vitette. - Thank you. You're welcome. - Number 8-20. - Yes. Perfect. All right? Yes, yes, fine for today. Now, it would only be missing... adjust the tunnel to 69 degrees. We need a theodolite. - One that? - A theodolite. The excavation angle must be precise, otherwise we will go out at the rental store in front. We have to buy one. - 3,000 dollars. - Well, why don't you steal it? - We can't. - Why not? Natural balance, Mario. - Are you still with that nonsense? - It's not silly. How much more will I have to spend? Are you kidding me? - Is the rest okay, Fernando? - I'm working on it. - I'll fix it... - Can you hear me a moment? A tripod, a carrier... and a laser pointer. Theodolite. We will? I told my wife I went fishing. Okay, over there. Another 100 and it arrived. Where the fuck is this going to be? Keep it running. We're wasting gas for nothing. You are new, I know that they speak very well of you, but I do not know you. I will explain the picture of the situation, so you can better understand the big picture. We are in a stolen van, and you stole a very strange one, expecting an idiot who was supposed to be here and didn't come, and besides, in this shitty neighborhood... So leave it on, because if there is any surprise... - we can run, right? - Right. Do as he says. Now, we're all screwed. We really want to. What the fuck, please! - Save. - Save. What are you doing? Waiting for a friend, but it looks like he's not coming. - Give me the document? - Yes of course. What's the matter, sir? We are in a democracy! There is no doubt, sir. Document... safe... Who is Walter Galarraga? - My uncle, cop. - Your uncle. Hail, is there a problem? - Hello, boy. - Save. - They're our friends. - Yes. - Chela, was it you? - Yes, Mami, I called. I was worried. You know, I saw this station wagon, these guys... these people. Sorry, cop, sorry, guys, sorry. - Chela... - Okay, okay. Very well, madam. It was a good attitude. Taking care of the security of the neighborhood. Congratulations. - All right now? - Yes, fine. - Thanks, cop. - Good... AND... what do you think, cousin? - Does the clutch pull too much? - It looks a little short. Can't you withdraw? The leg is not going to stretch. It's heavy. How are you feeling? As far as I know, well. I feel that effort. I repair the carburetor because it has a better chance of recovery. Okay. Let's start. - If you can. - I think so. Yes. Are you going to talk or do we ask? - Talk about what? - What does your wife do here? Where should I put her if she lives here? We should have been alone. - Nothing was said. - Like? Nothing was said. The "turkish" will not speak. She is in it too. You never cheated on me, are you going to do that now? No, what I'm saying is that you have an addiction, which is to fuck. - Isn't that good? - Yes, that is not a good thing. And what does women have to do with faith? Is fucking also an act of faith, or not? Caution! Caution! Bunch? Daniel? Titus is out of the game. Yes Yes... if you add some pieces, since there is no more land. And the tunnel was the same width. So it was just that part. - The drill is destroyed. - No, let's interrupt. - Tomorrow we buy another one. - No, enough, stop here. Enough. We did more than half the tunnel, we are 7 meters from the bank. Just tell me if you know how to open the safe. There is more than I thought but I will resolve. All of this is in vain. There are no impossible solutions. - There are misplaced problems. - Enough nonsense. Enough! This is for professional. We are betting on everything: security, time and, in my case, money. So far I've wound you up, Fernando, that's enough. Want to live an adventure? jump with parachutes, drunk, do what you want, I just need to know how to open the safe. Answer. Which one are you? Seriously. The eye of the sky. I like Serio. I like the name. It's crazy, because if you start thinking... we are seeing the past of the stars. The light takes years to get here, then some do not exist anymore. It's true. We think they exist, but they are gone. "We think there are"... "but they are gone"! - Who is it? - Fernando. - I'm with people. - Mario, I need to talk. Fernando, I'll call you tomorrow. It doesn't piss me off. I expect. Okay, go up, but don't knock on the door. Mario. Open it for me. Mario. - I was busy. - What you want? - I already decided. - What? All. - Did you smoke? - It doesn't matter. - We will see. - Mario, the banks they are well protected when they are closed, and are well protected when they are open, but the measures are different. There are good security measures to prevent cash theft. And good security measures to avoid the "hole". But so far, no one has ever created a security system, in case they happen... both at the same time. "Hole" and "express theft". So, we... we entered the bank... when it is open to the public. - The safe will be open... - No alarms. For the police... it must be normal, an express theft, from thieves who steal boxes from customers. But things inside the bank get complicated... and what do we do at that moment? We do "cuckoo". "Cuckoo" watch... We have shown that we do not want to escape through the door. And if the police believe that we don't want to escape through the door, because it is an express theft, you will never think we have a "hole"! "Hole" that we will use not to enter the bank, but to... Go out! What is your name? Do you have... relaxation. Do you have... relaxation. Do you have... PARKING Ladies and gentlemen this is an assault. I want everyone lying on the floor! Come on, everyone! - All! - Everyone down! Quiet, or it will end badly! You, too, on the floor. To the floor! Do not look up. I told you to stay down or I'm going to kill you! Acassuso Police Station? Serrano, from Banco Rio. They are robbing the bank! Give me the money! Come on, fill it up! All! Fill, fill, I said! You too, idiot! Come on, move! We will! Don't be an idiot, fill up. Put everything in the briefcase. We will! Come on, put more! More. Get them out of here! - There's no more. - Here, fuck. - There's no more! - Don't be an idiot! Keep filling too! Step 1: "Cuckoo". Come come! Raise. Do as I say and nothing will happen. Cuckoo! Keep filling! - Stop, police! - No! No, no, don't shoot. Neither you. Get out of. Drop the gun! Leave the! In between. - No, don't look. - What would happen? So. - Step 2: "Bunker". - Bunker. - Come you. Come on. - Me? You walk. Come on! Come on, come here. C'mon C'mon. Come on, come here. C'mon C'mon. On ladder. Go slowly, that nothing will happen. We will! We will. Shut up. Come on, come on, get out. The bag, look here. We will. We will! Get out, or I'll kill you! Martin, please open! Martin, open it, Martin! Martin, please open! - I haven't seen my nephew yet! - Come on, Martin! Do not disturb so much. We have nothing to lose. The police are out there. Don't complicate things. We will. Come come. Don't complicate everything, come on. - Get out or kill her - I know him. It will kill her. Stop or he'll be more nervous. Nothing will happen, but get out. We will. Skirt. Well... you made yourself good, didn't you? It's good. Stop it all going to hell! Surrender! Don't hurt anyone. You are surrounded! - Here, take it. - No. No problem. Go Go go. Give me your cell phone. Everyone with their hands up! If you want to talk to me, it will be around here. Come on, if I don't regret it. We will. Come on. Surrender! Don't be smart! The bank is full of hostages. - You, on that side. - First I go to the other. Get out of here and I'll kill you. Step 3: "Cameras". Step 4: "Break through", Pepe. End? Step 5: "Cannon Power". - What is this beast called? - Cannon Power. Now. Time. 7 seconds! Step 6: "Time". I saw that I was about to run away with a hostage, I told him to stop and there was nothing I could do but go back to the bank. After a while, they released Serrano. Yes, 4 or 5 entered. 4 or 5? I saw 4, sir. They have a pistol, a rifle... They put on the hood, tried to steal the cashier on the first floor but they saw that they were surrounded... - How many hostages are there? - Between employees and customers, - about thirty people. - Cameras? They entered the bunker, but there is a new security system that saves the information on a hard disk in the central. - Well, what else? - They asked for my cell phone... - and returned my weapon. - Your work weapon. Yes. Maybe they did it on purpose, to avoid a disciplinary sanction. What if they were colleagues? I have no idea, sir. What is it, boy? I'm peeing. I am not listening. I'm peeing. Can't you wait? You are going to pee in that vase. What is it, boy? Don't you want to leave? Don't look at him, Doc. What the fuck is going on up there? You heard? They are climbing on the roof. Bastards, want to get into the bank. Let's shoot them. - Hello? - Hello, does anyone hear me? I'm Miguel Sileo, responsible for solving all this confusion. Am I going to talk to you? Hello? Here. What is this? It is the Halc َ n Group's trading manual. - Where did you get this from? - A friend judge. As soon as the police know about the theft in a few minutes we will be surrounded: someone has to keep them busy while we open the vaults. - It has to be you. - Like me? You are crazy. I am a thief. I climb on the balconies, kick the bucket I’m wrong if there’s a need, but that’s another thing, no. Mario? You have to act. It is not so difficult. You have to do it. Tension, relaxation, tension, relaxation. I want them to have it all the time, while we do the exercises. Is acting an action, or not? Connect with other people who came to class, and begin to understand where we are direct. Come on, Mario. Have fun! Share the space! And exhale! You have relaxation. You don't have to be just mental! What's your animal, Mario? Come on, release your inner animal. Tough! Now! Keyed up! AND... loose! Guys, this is important! Never leave the scene, always on the scene, for the scene, with the other. Invent shapes. Imagine. To act is to imagine. Now! Hello, is anyone listening to me? Hello? Is anyone there? Get all these people off the roof. I don't want to see a damn cop or I will kill a living hostage, directly. Hear? Give me a minute. A helicopter from the Halcán group is arriving, in which sector can it land? Very well. Are you calmer? Now, that's fine. Why don't we start over? My name is Miguel Sileo... - What is your name? - My name is Walter. Hello, Walter, I ask you to stay calm, tell me what you need. How can I help you? - Who are you? The negotiator? - Yes, I'm the negotiator. Well, where are you? I want to see you. Come closer. Come on, please, let's go. Look. Is this you. If you have an elderly person or someone nervous, why not let him go? I released a while ago, without hurting him, what more do you want? Calm down, nothing will happen. If nobody takes a shit, nothing will happen. You take care of what happens outside and I take care of inside. - Did the prosecutor arrive? - He's coming. Tell him to hurry up. I give an hour. We will. Do you have... relaxation. Do you have... relaxation. Do you have... relaxation. Do you have... The front of the street is completely controlled by video cameras: there are two inputs, the main door and the parking lot. We don't know where the hostages are now, where they are kept. Perhaps distributed over 3 floors, or... they are changing places. We don't know where they are. What do you imagine, prosecutor? For now, there is an attempted theft. Can I go to the bathroom please? Again, son? Do you know that it sucks? Yes you know. - Stand up. - No, it's okay. Get up and come with me. Come on, let's go. No problem, come. Calm down, come on Do you urinate on yourself? No problem. Calm calm. Don't be in a hurry, Sileo. Walter? Hello, Miguel, and the prosecutor? - Give me time. It's coming. - But are you on a tricycle? I give my word that I am doing everything I can, but you have to help me... a hostage. Set a hostage free so they can think that you also want a happy ending. You see? Calm down boy, everything is fine. Now, yes, you will pass urine with pleasure. Piss in the police car, come on. Do it, do it all, come on. - Come come. - Come, come here! - Come on, come here! - We will! Quick, fast! We have him, come on, come on! We will! We will. Hello, I'm Miguel Sileo from Grupo Halc َ n. I'll ask you a few questions. Tell me how many thieves have you seen? Weapon, what kind of weapon? Are the hostages all together or are they separated? Stay calm... Walter, thanks for letting the boy go. You're welcome. Maybe next time someone will send me someone who can say something. - How are things at home? - Good. - I can handle it. - I'm with the prosecutor: violation of freedom... attempted theft... these are the things against, but you haven’t hurt anyone, without injuries and therefore... find a good lawyer and leave immediately. If you stay too long, things can get worse... Suppose an elderly person dies... they will blame you. So I can't help you. You know what, Miguel, the boys who are with me are young and... I don't control them well: they don't want to go back to prison, got it? - Do you want me to talk to them? - Don't worry... I will calm them down. Come on Marciano, who has here... Whose phone is this? - Whose phone is this? - It's mine. Excuse me. It turns out that... it's my birthday. Calm down, Grandma َ. Calm. No, you needn't be worried. Don't be afraid, grandma. - No problem. Your birthday? - Yes... How beautiful... What's your name? Susana. Happy birthday, Susy. - Hey, Doc? - Yes. Why don't you find a candy, something to put a candle on. Does anyone have a candy? - So that Susanita can celebrate? - I have. Here it is. - Give it to me here. - Keep calm. This will be over soon. It's Ramirez, I have news. I have two crows and a canary and an elderly woman. They are bringing it to an alfajor with a lit match. They seem to be celebrating the anniversary. Are you kidding, Ramirez? Happy Birthday to You What is it? A wake? We will! Happy Birthday to You Congratulations, Susanita Happy Birthday to You! Angry! And now a present from us, Susy. Let's go home. Yes now. We will. 5, 6, 7, 8, come on! Your bag, my love. - Let's go home, Susy. - Yes... Celebrate the birthday with the grandchildren. - Yes. - I ask you a favor, my love. This is a little gift for the police officer who is going to receive it. Tell him, "Walter sent you." And if you ask "how did Walter treat you?", You say "fantastic!" Say "We behave so well with him". So... bye, my love, bye. Madam, come closer! Bye, have a nice party! Ready. Come on, lady. Bye, my life! Calm calm. Come on. - Come on, ready. Watch out. - C'mon C'mon. Miguel, I released you a grandma. Thank you, Walter. Did you talk to the boys? How is everything going? Mal. The situation has gotten complicated now. Damn. It may end better than I thought. We came to do something fast but it took so long that it all went down the drain. A shame. Surrender, that's what you should do. It's easy to talk, Miguel. Look, I'll tell you... It's been 2 weeks since I left prison for 15 years, Miguel. Do you understand what I mean? Yes I understand. But the more time passes, it gets more complicated, you know? You have to surrender. Divine, divine, I cannot believe, I cannot. Commander, Sniper 1, anything new? - Raven in a gray suit in the crosshairs. - Got it, Sniper. Keep. No, I will not go back to prison, no, no. Walter, you're smart, aren't you? - Ended. - Yes, I know it's over. Please bring the prosecutor here to make sure I get out of here alive, and that they are not going to hit me... because you know it is so. I bring the prosecutor, but after talking to him what you're going to do... is go out. Surrender. - I can only do that. - Yes Yes. I have people above me, powerful, they decide. I know. I already know all this. - Listen to me. - What bad luck. Suspect out of reach. Bye, Miguel. Hi! He said he will surrender. What do you think? There is something strange. What the fuck... What happened? It's overheated. It has to cool down. - Hello? - Walter, the prosecutor will speak. - I'm going to pass it. - Right. Mario, we need more time. What happened? Good afternoon, Walter, this is Prosecutor Chester. Power overheated, it is necessary more time to cool it down. Hello? Hello Hello. Walter? Walter? Miguel, are you there? Yes, with the prosecutor. What happened? What surname did the prosecutor say? Chester? Yes. That idiot, son of a bitch? Forget it, Miguel! The last time they hit me. That sewer rat didn't lift a finger for me. - I can guarantee that... - Shut up, delinquent! Remember how you laughed when the inspector hit my head? You are confusing, Walter. Am I confusing? Me? Am I confusing? You bastard idiot are you going to put me back there? Put me back there? I tell you one thing: I will surrender only through my lawyer. Otherwise, there is no conversation. Calm down, Walter. Do I stay calm? Shit fascist! Give me Miguel. Walter, give me the lawyer number and we've already called him. So we're done with it. Give me the number. Now I’m going to give you my lawyer’s phone number, - 15-4... - 15-4... - 6-5-9... - 6-5-9... 2-8-1-1. 28-11, and the name? Juan Carlos Mendizabal. Tell him that I am "the man in the gray suit". Do you have doubts about me? I am a blameless person. Started. And will it arrive in a second? How many times will I have to speak, my God! But it is so difficult, I told you, his story... Yes, who is it? - Dr. Mendizabal? - Yes, who is it? I'm Prosecutor Chester from the San Isidro Prosecutor's Office. Here, now, they were taken hostage at Banco Rio in Acassuso and one of the thieves asks for your presence. It looks like it's your client. Yes, but I have so many customers, tell me at least one name. Who is it? He identified himself as the "man in the gray suit". But what a strange thing. If only it left! Doctor, this man has a lot of hostages, you know? Well, give me the address and I'll be right there. Liberator and Peru. Thank you very much, I'm leaving now. - Sonia, I'm going out. - Good. He's already coming. It stopped again. How much time do you have left? We gave it 5 minutes. - Come on, Ferdi. - Try now. What happened? How's it going? Can we do it? All right? But you don't care about the money! No, it is not the money, no. Brecht asked what it is worse to rob a bank, to fund it. You are justifying yourself. No. NO... I am not a Robin Hood. It turns out that I am completely taken by this thought. I get up and go to bed, always thinking about the plan. I believe it is perfect. A plan, Fernando, starts to fail when its creator believes he has a perfect plan. That Brecht did not say. I'm saying. Step 7: "Weapons and handrails". Weapons and handrails! Come on, you idiot. Doc. Come on. Final step: "Escape and Reunion". Right. Walter? - Did you talk to my lawyer? - Yes, it's coming. Do you know what you were thinking, Miguel? We've been here for a long time. And before giving it to us, we'd like to eat something. And what do they want to eat? Ask us for 5 pizzas. Very well, 5 pizzas. And to drink? Coke. Let it not take too long, because I don't want to spend the afternoon waiting. Walter. Walter? What a bastard... They were about to leave. Why are you buying time? - Or for what? - They are blocking the entrances. Or getting ready for a confrontation. - But... - What else can it be? - Sileo? - What? - The bank director. - I'm the director. Tell me, there are exits that are not the entrance, the roof or the parking lot? - Didn't I tell you enough? - Answer me. - No, there is no more way out. - Are you sure? Yes please. - Take care of people. - And what do we do here? - But go away! - Come please. - And, who pays me? - We'll pay now. Chief, the pizzas have arrived. The number called is outside the coverage area. The number called is outside the coverage area. What a bastard. Take the money. Good. Who spoke? Who's talking? Who was? What are you talking about, Mario? By, he started spreading the rumor. It talks about Banco Rio too. Too bad, I thought we were professionals. Nobody opens their mouths here. Well, cool what you say. This is what I want to check. Perhaps they are talking about another "job". You think? Well, it can be. - Stay calm, Mario. - Calm? I'm very calm. I just want to know who talked too much. Ferdi. Mario, you're talking nonsense. Yes? - Am I talking nonsense? - Yes, you. Stop, stop. - Did you see what that asshole said? - Stop, stop, stop! - Am I talking nonsense? - You're talking. Enough, Mario, put the gun down. Mario, put the gun down. Holy shit, who spoke? It's a toy, idiot. Go fuck yourself, Uruguayan. Sorry, sorry, guys, but we want to make it clear an important point: we will not enter the bank with a real gun, - we will use replicas. - Replicas! This is a joke? If you drank, we will all drink. We don't need anyone to shake hands and escape a shot. What if they escape and we have to defend ourselves? After the Ramallo massacre, none police officer will dare to enter the bank. As long as there are hostages, no shots will be fired. Also, if they catch us... the replicas... avoid several years in there. Believe me, the plan is perfect as it is. But if anyone has any doubts, let them speak now. Yes, me. How will the police know that we use replicas? All calm, yes? So stay where you are. No, down, look down. Like this. Come on, like this. Stay calm, the pizzas are coming... I don't know how they did it, but they left the bank. To the sewers. Do you know what to do? Ramirez's people enter the sewer, we go over the top and arrest them. - No. - How can I not? We don't know if they are inside or not. You can't afford more time! Can't you see they came for this? They don’t answer the phone, don't get the pizza, that shows that there is no one in the bank. - What do you need? - Don't confuse me. - It's not like that. - It confuses me I'm saying no and I'm in charge! - Yes... - I'll sanction! - You don't see reality! - It is not enough to enter. If there is a crossroads, which head will roll? - What a crossroads! - Which head will roll, Miguel? My sister is calling from the inside! Put your life in danger, lady! - Hello? - Please let me through. Hang up her phone, please! Please turn off your cell phones! - You're calling from there! - They call from inside, boss. Please turn off your cell phones, just in case! - Get ready to enter. - Turn off cell phones. Regroup! Advance! Attention! Police! Police! Out! Out! Out! - What happens now? - It happens, for wanting to save on the whore that gave birth to the engine. I said how much a new one cost and I didn't like it. You said you rebuilt. We have millions of dollars, - what are two thousand pesos? - Say it now, Felcio. We are ready. Let's go with the oars. And with the money? How are we going to do it? It is many kilometers to walk. Yes, it will take us more than three hours. I thought of using an inflatable boat. The motor? There is no depth. So if you find out about the sewer plan, will be waiting for us at the river. Okay, we're fried. - You're right. - We can build a dike. - Done? We can go? - We will! We will! This this! Straight, straight! Go Go go! Come on, quick! We will! That. We continue! We continue. Left, left. Help me! - I chase them! - It has traps! I chase them! Go! Go, stronger! We will! Go! Go! Go... C'mon C'mon. Very well, Mario. Sir, I have news. The weapons found are replicas. I repeat, they are replicas. Nutria1, Nutria2, hear me? - Nutria1, Nutria2, do you hear me? - I hear you. We will! - Police! Identify yourself! - I'm Sileo! No, no... This must be the most expensive van in the world. BANCO RIO What a son of a bitch! IN THE RICH NEIGHBORHOOD WITHOUT WEAPONS OR RANCORES IT'S MONEY ONLY AND NOT LOVE Incredible! Congratulations, guys. Congratulations. Really. Now, modest. And discretion. In the history of Argentine police I do not remember a gang that acted with so much organization, so much technique and so much luck, as to who did the theft of Banco Rio. Evidently a very prepared gang, but be sure... everyone, who will soon be drinking mate in jail. Later new information from our Exclusive Unit... Name? Mine, or my husband's? His. Alberto de la Torre, my husband. It's whoever robbed the bank. Banco Rio. - Did he rob the bank? - Yes. All the money is in my house, on the roof. - Want to write down the address? - One moment please. Just a moment. Delegate! Stop! Stop! - Come on, motherfucker! - Why did you stop me, idiot? Stay calm, motherfucker! Fuck you all! Motherfuckers! - Get out! - Don't touch me! - Stop! - Don't touch me! Go to the motherfucker! Holy shit! Ruben "Beto" de la Torre has just been captured, after a cinematic chase. Supposedly one of the members of the Banco Rio robbery gang. Are looking for the guy who organized the bank robbery in Buenos Aires. Are you around here? They will never find it. I know people from Buenos Aires who told me how it went. And how it was? He left Montevideo, passed through Brazil. They already got it right there. The creator of the scam is not just anyone. It is a well-known politician from Buenos Aires. At this point, you will be in Miami or on an island where no one knows you. We will never know who it is. With the iron one near a lid. - Can I bring the car at night? - Yes. Hey, stop! Stop, stop! - We will! We will! - We will! We will. Very good. I was really surprised. Very good. What? What? Come on, what's up? GO... Won't the game start? Put it, let's go. Want to see a movie? To me it does not matter. Put the game. What if I hang up is better? Disconnect. So we talked. Better, isn't it? - Come on, Lu. - What? - Come on, it's nothing. - What's it? - Come on, get in here! - But, Daddy! - Stay with me! - Dad, what's wrong? Close the door, Lu, please! Stay with me! Stay with me, I ask you. If you ask questions, stay inside Police! Turn around! On the floor! On the floor, I told you, lie down. On the floor! Release her, motherfucker! Release it, don't touch it! - Daddy! - Take off the handcuffs. Received, base. Anything else? 38-year-old man took his wife hostage. In 5 minutes we are. Chief, arrested Walter, from Banco Rio. I don't give a damn. With me, doll! I miss you, brunette! How are you? Look, I spoke to lawyers... Forgive me, Lu. Forgive me. I'm sorry for everything. Forgiveness for all the bullshit I did and for how much I made you suffer since you were a child. For all the times I lied to you, I'm sorry. I know that... heard it many times, Lu... but now its over. Ended. Finished. Never. Really. And today I wanted to see you... because I wanted to look you in the eye and speak to you. Is that... you trust... what daddy told you... today, it is true. I understand everything, huh? I understand everything. Your anger... your camera... - yes, whatever you want... - Punch you? Punch me, yes. If you start thinking about the most important men in history in the most powerful families, you will always find something dark, something dark. As if they understood that to stand out, first of all, they had to "get dirty". But do you feel "dirty" for what you are going to do? No. Should I be concerned? What do you think? You did a good job. No, since it will be our last session, I tell you, Daniel, you did a good job. Why do you think I did a good job with you? Because within a week of committing the theft of the century, I feel like the most "pure" man in the world. - Hello. - Hello. - What are you doing around here? - A spiritual retreat. Some problem? Document? What an idiot! I left it at the hostel. What an idiot. I can't be like this anymore. Excuse me. Can we have a look? Do I have a choice? Fuck... what can I do. Command, attention. I think we have the suspect you're looking for. - Thank you. - Ara ْ jo. Take it all! Bye, Luis. Thank God. Get out of ي with nothing, huh? And the aunt? The aunt? He stayed inside the house. Look. TODAY THE CREATOR OF THE THEFT TO BANCO RIO Look. - Congratulations. - Thank you. I liked you with the coat, huh? But, even this one I don't think is bad. I can't say the same... - What are you doing here? - No, don't be under any illusions. It's just a temporary exit. At 8 pm I must return. Consider it goodbye. Is it so early? You know we can do a massacre, don't you, Mario? - I'm retired, Fernando. - Yes. Me too. - Courtesy of the guards. - Still on that, my God! - Focus me. - "Concentrate" you... - Focus. - After so much insistence... Deep. - AND? - Focus. - Saw? - Focus, yes, yes. And how much! How strong! But go fuck yourself, idiot! It was a carefully planned coup. The thieves ran away with money and jewelry from the safe through a tunnel dug underground, where they placed traps, to avoid persecution. The boat was found in a channel that passes just below the bank. Let's see if, before the trial, we will be able to clarify what it happened with the "theft of the century". And also because of all the money neither the coins were left. 5 PEOPLE WERE CONDEMNED BY THE CALL "THEFT OF THE SACLE" THE FEATHERS WERE BETWEEN 7 AND 15 YEARS I was in Montevideo when the bank was robbed!
