Mr.? Sir! He ??must have really hurt himself. Oh, Arthur! I loved him. This is terrible! Fortunately, you were not married yet. - Married, she inherited. - You only think about that. Is Mr. of the 3 fortunes of France? My good master! I'm here. - Are you hurt? - Mr. is in a position that is very uncomfortable. - He'll kill himself. - As long as he misses himself, it does not matter. - These dramas are making me thirsty. - But seriously, - what do you have in your blood? - Boredom. - He's lacking something. - But what? He has everything. 17 castles, three mills, youth, health and the love of my daughter. He lacks misfortune, which is the spice of life. I would like some shade in the sun of our host. Help me, Leon. I suggest getting back on the boat. Leon, what time is it? 18:30, sir. As usual. 18:30? 18:30... - At what time do we dine? - 19:30, as usual. Another hour. Mr. is hungry? Oh, no. - He can marry my daughter. - Do not rush him. He seems sensitive. Mind you, if I may say so, it is the ninth suicide attempt of Mr. Arthur - in the matter of a week. - In any case, he will marry my daughter. Let us calm Arthur before delivering him to the joys of the alcove. This cruise to the Orient will open his horizons. What colors, what exotism! - It's lovely. - Yes, it's lovely. Arthur, we'll take a ride on land? No! We go around the world without stopping? Looks. I see there Mr. Biscoton coming towards us, the attorney of Mr. I missed you in Genoa, I missed you in Beirut and here, I arrive to Sydney. - Hello, sir, "Biscotin". - "Biscoton." The news is serious. Ah, finally! Really? So I transferred the Stohfeld shares and sold the units of the Lolium Company, to re-buy them after. Ah? Ah... Alas... Good. But it's a ruin. There is nothing left for you... This is the crash. Crash! What? Arthur is ruined? He ??will not have my daughter. What will become of us? - I watch over your mother, Alice. - This is terrible. Arthur! Arthur! - Arthur! - Leave me alone. Arthur! So do you restart again? You continue? I want to die. You do not have the right to kill yourself. Life is a gift from the gods. While rich, life did not interest me, so now... The jinx is within him the germ of bliss. I will die. My boy, you will miss yourself, as usual. - Not this time. - You do not understand that you are born and you live to leave us a little more happiness on Earth? - I have no more means. - I'm not talking about money. So you have no affection? I, your friend, Alice, your fianc?e - all that does not count? - I can not do anything else for you. As are you sure? Certain. You want to die? Yes. You insist? Yes. Do you want death? Yes. You'll get it. But before that, you can still do something. Come. Thirty three... Caugh, please. Your mouth. Thank you. OK. A strong health like all our customers. Hence the name of our company: The Centennial. A life insurance with us is a patent for longevity. Well. So... You insure yourself for a capital of 2 million dollars. Considerable sum. For the benefit of Miss Alice Ponchabert. My fianc?e, yes. Lovely thought. And for the benefit of Mr. Goh. Chinese philosopher. My mentor, my counselor, my only friend. A half for each? Yes. So upon your death your fianc?e and your old friend each would receive 1 million dollars Even if I fall down the stairs coming out of here? We cover all risks, except suicide. Yes, of course. I understand. I see that you are insuring yourself for the duration of one month. A trip, I suppose? A long journey, yes. A month, 30 days, This brings us to the New Year. Will you sign? I do not have the right to kill myself anymore? No. But if you want to die, I'll help you. How? You would kill me? I would act like a father. You will feel nothing. But first, have fun, inebriate yourself, do what pleases you. Death will come by surprise. You will not feel anything. You will not know the day nor the hour. You have one month before you, 30 days or a few seconds. Mister Goh! Mister Goh! Mister Goh! Arthur, haven't you noticed - anything? - What? My hairstyle. Admirable. Miss Alice the sun is preparing for us a lovely sunset. This is beautiful. What? This dusk. "Last"? I heard you snoring, Suzy. It was charming. A real bird. Stop courting me, Cornelius. I have other worries. Arthur? Well, you look upset. - I have not slept all night. - It prevented you from sleeping? - Where is Mr. Goh? - We have not seen him since yesterday. Sir, look. There he is. They speak Chinese. Leon, let me. I understand, sir. Mister Goh! Mister Goh? Mister Goh? You're looking for me? I... Oh no. No, no, no. Yes. Finally, no... - I was just passing by. - I feel your nervousness. Relax. These girls are like sails on the sea. Everything disappears. What? - I thought I was going to... - What? You promised to make me disappear, but no comedy. Oh, but I'm serious. I wonder. - Do you think I could forget that you mean to me 1 million dollars? - What are you waiting for? - All in good time. Do not disturb my thoughts. Enough! Enough! Ah, thank you, Leo! Thanks for your help. - I thought that Mr. was joking. - Ben, funny joke. And now, Miss Alexandrine Pinardel, from the striptease of Gay Paris. Ah, it's you, Leon. My shoes. Pass me my belt. Come button me. Hurry up. You're clumsy today. I'm not used to this, miss. - But... - Do not panic. It has been 3 months that I come to see you without daring to talk to you. I've been here for only 8 days. They're pursuing me. Where do you think you? You can follow them Go settle your stories elsewhere. - No... - Stop! I saw many small, rich, even a emir. He offered me gazelles, a kingdom... - Get out! - Just for a moment. Get out. How? You are armed? A woman can go around the world without a Browning. - Around the World? - Yes. Me too. This is it. Tell me your nonsense life story. I'll tell you the truth. I'm a billionaire. My fianc?e is on my yacht, I am ruined, and they want me to kill myself. - Do you understand? - Yes. - Really? - Outside. - One last word. - Which? You are amazing, with or without a Browning. Why? You are the first woman who has ever resisted me. - Even with your wick? - I will cut it. So? You do not look like - anything anymore. - Farewell, Alexandrine Pinardel. - They are still there. - Finish this. Easy. Useful appointments. Hold these. And put on these hats. Mr. does not regain the boat? I would like you to let me live my life. But where is she? - You understand what he says? - Very good. Why? - What are you writing? - I study. - What? - Men. - "Men"? - They fascinate me. Their gods, their streets, their games their dishes, their heads... - Yours, for example. - And what will you do with all this? A book. A bestseller. After I buy a house, I will have kids, they will go around the world study, teach, and start over again. And the striptease? Oh, I must make a living. And that is not dangerous? The danger is there. Just don't think about it. And if a swindler attacks you? - I'd like to see that. - I, for example. You? You never looked at yourself? Luck. All is well. Where are we going? To sleep. Together? No but! I did not ask you to follow me. Go. I will make you dinner. And then, goodnight. Eat, eat. Mr. is not afraid to damage the stomach? Leon, I would like you to stand at a distance. Poor Miss Alice. We will still have to lie to her. All the same. I am not used to talking to women. - Usually, gesture is enough... - I will note that. - What are you doing? - What do you write? I noted here 97 ways to woo women. But this one was missing. This is done where? In France? Yes. How strange. I thought the French were talkative. - Here they are! - Who? - The Killers. - I will suppress them. I got one. Damn, he swims. But stop, you poor thing. But they want to kill you. But I asked them to. Really? For 2 million, I would shoot you right away. You too are sent by Mr. Goh? You tremble. What are you talking about, with your wish to disappear? Oh dear, another complication. And then I let myself into it, I listen to him. You too have doubts, moments of failure? Sometimes. - Alexandrine... - Do not enjoy it. I don't feel like dying anymore. Well, enjoy. Listen, do not move. I will settle the case and come back. "I'll be back"... You are the 412th who said this to me, and I've never seen anything. So, lions, are you camouflaged? I'll blow you up. Show yourselves. I will find you. Oh, sorry. Watch. It's them! Let's go. Enough. The joke has gone on long enough. - At Mr. Goh. - Taxi! I just found out that life is earned by the punches. She is charming. You will not make us live - by doing stripteases. - Who knows? Mister Goh? Mister Goh? Ah! "Biscotin"? "Biscoton." Every time, you... I have stunning news... - Where is Mr. Goh? - He's gone. - Where? - I do not know. He gave me this for you. "I did not have the strength to keep my promise "I have entrusted the care of shoot you to devoted friends. "I went beyond the Himalayas, to convent of Shouli." He left, leaving me killers on my hands. I'll talk to them, these killers. No, Mr. Goh! The convent of Shouli, where is it? - I have news... - Later. See you on the boat in a quarter of an hour. And us, what do we do? You're ruined and moreover you sleep outside. Here, Leon. These are the last. May I take your white tuxedo? Yes, I suppose. And me, am I nothing, here? - I will be right back. I'll explain. - Where? - To the Himalayas. "Himalayas"? - So "Biscotin"? - "Biscoton." You take a flight to Delhi. There, you go to a second airfield, and a courier will take you to the foot of the mountain. - I have amazing news... - Later. - The plane to Himalaya? - Excuse me? - The plane to the Himalayas? - It's the other airfield. - You have to cross the city. - Let us cross. Leon, see this man. Sir, we would like to go to the another airport, on the other side of the city. We have 20 minutes. Airport. Quickly. - Airport? - Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, this temple... We get off from here without shoes? We are in India, adapt. This place looks more like a mosque than an airfield. - Airport? - Yes, yes. Come, this way. Astronomic observatory. "Buildet" in Twentieth Century Fox. - What did he say? - This is an astronomical observatory. In 1750, these gentlemen had already calculated the distance that separates us from the Sun. Explain to this individual that what interests me is Mr. Goh. - Go? - You know him? Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come. Airport, yes, yes. What is it? Engine kaput. "Push, please. Push." Push, please. Push. Push, please. Push. OK! Airport. - Airport? - Airport, airport. Airport. But this is where were came from. We were there. Yes, yes, airport. This man is of great beauty, which is matched only by his stupidity. You missed the plane. - When is the next? - In a month. I'll be dead in a month. There is no other aircraft. This is impossible. Impossible is not Hindu. There are private companies, but that's at your own risk. We're gaining altitude. You should wear something warm. What is this leak? - I'll find out. Commander, is it normal to take water at this altitude? Is this the autopilot? Automatic, yes. Oh, oil! This is oil, sir. Here you are. And when do we arrive, Leon? Jump... Jumping. The pilot said he did not gain enough momentum. Let us not panic, we still have a wheel. Here we are. Where are we? Airfield. Good old boy. Passport. - Where are we, Leon? - I'll find out. - Could you tell us, Mr. Officer , where we are exactly? Oh, French? Is this the famous Professor Projewaski, who toured the world in a balloon? - Professor Projewaski? - Himself. Boris Nicola?ch Projewaski. Do you speak French? Yes, I'm Russian. The convent of Shouli, you know it? Talk quietly. Follow me. I have flown over the area, the Valley of the gods. - It's on the other side. - I'm going. - You taking me? - Impossible. They punctured the balloon with arrows. Foreigners are not allowed there. Those who go there, never return. We'll walk. - We need carriers. - Impossible. Even the sherpas do not climb. 6000m altitude, the avalanches, the living goddess... The yeti! You hear, sir? It seems that the yeti are many on these slopes. Watch. They found us. We need Mr. Goh. - Let's go. - I will join the sherpas. My legs are letting go, I will not take another step. In three days, it will be all over. Life begins. A life of pain and effort. Breathe deep, Leon. Which air do you smell? What do you think Alexandrine Pinardel? I do not know. You do not find her attractive? Yes, but if I may say so, I think Miss Alice is a feast for the mind. I can not stand it. And here comes the night. - You hear, sir? - An owl. No. It is the abominable snowman. The yeti is a kind of big sad monkey whose cry resembles that of the owl. - How do you know that? - I read it, sir. - Is it a man or a monkey? - He hangs between the two. Heaven! Walk on it... - Pass, Leon. - I will not allow myself. It is madness to continue. The land of gods begins here. Sir, I have the honor of giving you my eight days. I made my account with Social Security, you owe me... You think this is the place? Oh, I do not like it. Already down there, I had vertigo. Vertigo! Leon, give me your hand. Leon, catch me. Leon... What did you do with my shirts? When I travel, I always pin everything. I'll double your wages, Leon. Thanks, but I can not stand. I'm sorry. It is still better here. And all these clothes damaged. Come on, let's go. Mr. Goh will pay me for all this. My dear Leon, look at these summits, the snow, the nature. I never noticed it all. Take this scarf, you'll catch cold. Ah, if you could feel my heart. I'm burning, I'm suffocating! - I do not recognize you. - I'm a new man. Ah, Alexandrine! Did you feel the texture of his skin? Sir, I will take care of the wardrobe... Besides your brushes and your hangers, nothing interests you. - Do not sneeze, sir. - Why? Because of ava... the ava... Avalanches? - My heart is a coward, sir. - Tighten your buttocks. I do not see the connection. So this, really... We are at the collar. Come on, Leon, be strong. You are made for the peaks. I slip. I slip. Leon, I'm coming. Leon, what time is it? Usually, it's tea time. But I have nothing. - I do not blame you. - I do not blame you either. Your movement left a good feeling. - Leon look. - Difficult, sir. - The convent of Shouli. - Oh. Here is the Everest, sir. We can not climb higher. Mister Goh! - Do not stay there, sir. - I'll wait for Mr. Goh. The living goddess. I'm worried about this, sir. Drop ballast. Drop ballast! Drop. Wait, sir, I will support you... - Push, Leon. - I'm doing that. Harder. - Stay correct. - Given the circumstances... Drop ballast! You are told to drop ballast! We have not much left. - It's still them. - Who? - Mr. Goh's killers. - We're lost. Too bad, we have no choice. Hang on. Hang in there. One more effort, we are there. Go. - But go ahead. - Don't be afraid. Where are they? Not me! Not me! Mr. Lempereur we do not want to hurt you. Why are you following me? It's been 15 days we're trying to talk to you. We're here to protect you. We serve The Centennial. Your insurance company. We are ensuring that nothing happens to you. Ascend us! Ascend us! - Let me introduce myself, ex-warrant Cornac, working in the private sector now. Sergeant Roquentin, former enlisted of 412th and colleague of the warrant. - Say, what were you doing in this strange land? Looking for Mr. Goh. - He never left Hong Kong. - This one, we're watching him. So he mocks me? He said he goes to the end of the world and remains in Hong Kong? This is very simple. This Mr. Goh inherits 1 million dollars upon your death. - He sends you here... - And done. - And he stays in Hong Kong. - Where do we go from here. Go, to Hong Kong. To the port. Roquentin, give me your hand. Arthur has been gone for 12 days. And maybe he's dead for 12 days. And Alice is rich. Because after all, with 1 million dollars, one should see it coming. So Alice bought this yacht and we go back quietly through the islands. Arthur, this is a miracle. - Where is Mr. Goh? - You're not dead? My darling, you're all crumpled. This monster, there he is! We swim in fear waiting for this boy and you're complaisant. You do not know where Mr. Goh is? - You know it. - Alas, no. And you could say hello. You noticed his sad face? This is appalling. You said it, sweetheart. Wanting to die and not get there, it must be terrible. Go kiss your boyfriend. I do not understand that Mr. Goh does not end it soon. This expectation is intolerable for Arthur and for us. Mr. Lempereur, I have an announcement. A this pace, we become fathers, here. This is good news. Later. Mr. Goh is not there. If he's not here, then he is elsewhere. Let's go. To the massage room. I wait there. Make it quick. - But Roquentin... - Excuse me, chief. Sorry, chief. - Pretend nothing happened. - We found nobody. - I did. We are followed. - Where? Ever been followed from the front? Isn't it from behind? It's the Mercedes model 1952. - 6 cylinders. - Let's run. We must find Mr. Goh. Search the bars and hotels. Meet back in 1 hour. Quickly, let's jump. Jump. You clumsy! Alexandrine. A returner. You're always pursued? Alas. No kidding? How to make you understand? "Adrien"... - Arthur. - Yes, Arthur. Remove this. I like you as you were. - Really? - Yes. I do not want to draw danger to you. You always show your breasts? They feed me. So meeting tonight. - I will arrange everything. - Yes, that's is. Psst! Hey! Psst! Ah, Mr. Lempereur. Shh! You're right. What I like is the incense, in religion. This is very fragrant. So? The embalmed soul ascends easier to God. No. So, Mr. Goh? - He crunches. - He crunches? He ??is currently playing cricket. In an English club. - "In an English club?" - Yes. Mister Goh? Mister Goh! That's your retirement in the Himalayas? Mister Goh, it's me. Arthur, the game time is not for conversations. I do not play. You became nervous. Would you have a reason for that? Now, stop your joking. I want to live, do you hear me? I cancel our agreement. Finally, you understand. Life is delicious, when we almost lost it. I'm going to tell you one thing: all these adventures you're talking about have existed only there. There is no more room for boredom. Your are afraid, you live, you're out of danger. How could you imagine I could take your life? Life is invaluable. Women, birds, poets, candied fruit... Remember what I told you. You lacked the thorn of the rose and the nail in the shoe. Being suspended above a raging torrent and getting roasted, you call that a nail in the shoe? - And the fire shot? - You were shot at? By whom? Let's finish this. This poor boy is almost done and Mr. Goh is incapable. In here. Are you a man or not? What a question, Suzy! I mean, are you man? This is not a joke, it's about Arthur. A man must be able to kill his friend. Arthur wants to die, my daughter will be rich. I damn myself for you, Suzy. - Too late. Come on, hurry up. Yes, I was shot at. By whom? I do not care. But I am very fed up. Oh, life is sublime it's round, it's fragrant, it has wonderful breasts. Her name is Alexandrine. If you saw her elbows. Oh, her elbows! Taxi! Taxi, hurry, step on it. Oh, I lost a shoe. Excuse me. No tailing without a shoe. "Shoemaker" "chauffure" floor. - Above all, stay calm. - I am calm. It seems not. Driver, faster, faster. Cornelius, you understand? We bypass, and you shoot. Driver, come closer. There, there, there. - Shoot. - No, I can not. Well, I will shoot. Poor child, I got him. - There is no harm? - And you, chief? Oh, I'm used to it. These are the ones who shot at me. Taxi! I thought I saw two Chinese. Yes! The Mandarin man with a cape and the Chinese woman with a mustache! - You recognize them now? - Of course. These are our two Chinese. Come on, fire. My hat! Stop! Stop! I lost my hat. Who threw such Ostrogoths at me? Without my hat, I'm no man anymore. Quick or I'll show you what my name really is. Your name is Arthur. I pierced my sock. I lost my gun. Stop! You're a bum. Worse. Worse: an amateur. I admit, I'm not a killer. - I'll find one. - Where? In the forbidden island. The king of the underworld. - Who? - Charlie Fallinster. Charlie Fallinster? Exactly. There he is. Ah yes, there. Follow this sampan. Oh, sorry, chief. Wait for us! Wait for us! Oh, but the sea rose. He who might know is clever When I see him again... Will you knit with us? What does that mean? A man boarded, looking stupid. I looked at the dock to see if someone was following me. - You left the boat! - I took a little trip on land. - You lie badly. - No, I do not lie badly. Confess. I am a criminal. Suzy wanted to help you. I could not. - You wanted to kill me? - Everything is arranged. She found the man you need: Charlie Fallinster. - She must be caught up with. It may not be too late. - But where are you going? - To Charlie Fallinster. Charlie Fallinster? The Al Capone of the South Seas? Gentlemen. So, little lady? This is for my son. Well, my future son. Not my future, since you are going to... Arthur Lempereur represents 2 million dollars. Fifty-fifty, madam. What? Half-half? I said fifty-fifty. For such a small task? Sign, madam. I said: sign! Little lady... - When do you do the thing? We only have three days. The 1st of January, the premium, obviously... Arthur Lempereur is already a walking corpse. A walking corpse. What is this? I do not see who it is. - We'll find out. - Wit the natives. Sir? Sir, please... Can you tell me... Stop, listen. - What are we complaining about? All will be arranged. The weather is great and the Far East has great charm. Have you noticed slanted eyes? This is just an advertisement. This man is overworked. He must take pills Charlie Fallinster. - The man in the ad... - He resembles astonishingly. I suggest to Mr. to change his mind. Mustache. Gentlemen, come aboard. Who's this with the mustache? This is me. Where is Mr. Lempereur? Simply remain hidden until the 1st of January. Three more days? I stand guard, Arthur. - Nobody will approach you. - No. Nothing to fear. We will protect you, Arthur! Being native of Concarneau, I have always been a good sailor. One day I approached a bridge with some... So... Excuse me, ladies. Duty calls. Sir? Sir? Leon? Leon. Leon! The machine is ours, sir. Where does Mr. wants to go? I see only one place, Leon: The Ball Room. Ah, Miss Alexandrine Pinardel. I think about it too, sometimes. She is very honest. - Well, anyway... Are we close? We're always far from our loved ones, sir. I remember when I was serving admiral Pierrette, I was in love with a woman of color... We're arriving, sir. I'll tell you the rest later. She does not lack salt. - Can I get out? - One moment. - Stop screaming. - Am I inconsistent? - There is no one? - No, there's no one. Arthur! It's been long time. Alexandrine, hide me. Always being followed? Yes. You do not believe me? I think you're shy. Do not make fuss about it. You love me, you tell me, and I confront the situation. They will break down the door. This is too high. The savages! The pigs! You attack a young girl? Bastards! No! No! Music! - On stage! - Yes, sir. And here is Miss Alexandrine Pinardel, from the Gay Paris striptease! Arthur! Arthur! Sir, this way! What... Leon, finally! Where would we be better protected than here? I have my dignity. It was I who had the idea of ??this flight. And if I had to do it again, I would. And I say: "Down with the foreigners!" I want him by all means! Alexandrine in 3 days, it will be over. Should I get into your bed or do I open it now? If you could slip in and disappear. - I need privacy. - I understand, sir. - Yes, that's right, walk. Be angry. You are beautiful. I am the happiest of all men. You do not have any remorse? Throwing girls in prison! You have no shame? Me, in prison... I was raised with the sisters. I dreamed of spending a night in jail. You smell this musty taste, this fragrance of fungus and mildew? To think that I could have lived in mahogany. Oh, if there weren't any of these bars... I would gladly beat your behind. What legs! Leave my legs. You have other qualities. Drunkard. They take all women for sluts. Listen to me, I have never been happier. So, for yesterday, tonight and tomorrow, I thank you. Thank me for what? For existing. I wish Mr. a good night. The Centennial pays the bail of Mr. Lempereur. You can release him. Ah, Mr. Lempereur. We paid the bail. The Centennial owes you that much. But I was very comfortable here. Fools! I still had two days of danger. I go back to jail. Be nice, let me go back. Fool! If Mr. lets me. We lost the side! - Another hardware failure. - Stop! Cover your back. That's it, I repaired it. Ah, finally I breathe. Finally good time. Roquentin, follow me. On the right. - It's done, sir. - Attention, on my command. Fire! - They really want to hurt you? - Looks like it. Come, I have an idea. - Push me. - Yes, miss. No, do not push. I swallowed the pin. He swallowed the pin. Mr. Lempereur, he swallowed the pin! A cannon. All to your stations! - Rise, 150. - Rise, 150. Load the pieces! Ready! Fire! Roquentin I said 150, to rise. - I'm sorry, chief... - Charge. Parts ready! Fire! - It's outdated colonialism. - Let's run! - What do they say? - "Rendez-vous", I think. Never. We die standing. Look, an underground. What a deal. Strategic fallback. - Elastic Defence. - Let's run. - Who touched me? - Not me, I'm in front. I'm in front sir. It's not us. Attention. You're not my type. - It's you, huh, chief? - I tell you no. I can not stay here a minute longer. Come, I know the area. A junk is parting to the islands. They will take us. Idiots! One day left. I'll do the job myself. Sir? I did not sleep and I saw things. - What? - Follow me. Act normal. There, in the boat's cabin. We flee Charlie Fallinster and we take his ships. And that's not all. Come. Watch. You see the report? We are 5. - How many coffins? - Five. One for each. And that's not all. Smell. Opium? Of course. We are in the hands of pirates. This is the only place where Fallinster would not look for us. You are at his place. You are amazing. I knew it. Make gags with this shirt. Roquentin, make a hole there. Cornac, here. Leon, shoot this porthole. Certainly, sir. Cornac, bring me that barrel. - Put it on the other one. - Chief, we're sinking! - Fool! Cornac, help him. - I'm going. He ??made a hole under the waterline. I have what it takes. All that's left to do is close the valve. Make a hole in the ceiling. No, not the beam. - Yes, the ceiling. - The wick! In the ceiling, yes, chief. - In the good direction. - Yes, sorry. - Easy. - Ah, it's pierced! Cornac, light a fire. Gag your nose and mouth. Attention. I will put the opium on the fire. This trip is a wonderful dream. Ah, do not breathe. Quick, Alexandrine, I am numb. Who made that sound? Oh, Alexandrine, you're here! - Leon? - Yes, Alice, dear? - Why do you call me Alice? - I spoke? Cornac? Roquentin? Discipline is the strength of armies, it is important that any soldier lives at the expense of his listener. - Where am I? - In my arms. Do not worry. Everything is against us? We are lost. Arthur? Arthur? Arthur? Arthur? Arthur! Arthur! Arthur, you're not dead? My God, what's wrong? A mouth to mouth, maybe. Again. Are you done doing the cat? Oh, Alexandrine! I thought you were drowned. This is almost like it. You pretended to steal a kiss. Good. Yes, Alexandrine, it's true. I stole a kiss. We do not steal, we ask. I would have given you a thousand, if you had asked me. To table. - I love you, Alexandrine. - Drink. You tickle me. The sea, the sun... A tree. A sail on the horizon. We were so well alone. It's Cornac and Roquentin. Come, let's avoid them. The first who gets to the end the beach. I won! Cheater. - He saw us? - I hope so. - Oh, are you there? - We're saved. I bet you're done spot. The detectives of Centennial are located on Langkawi Island. The big shot must be there. Contact and alert the fishermen of Konangho. - In the jungle. - They come to save us. With a whole squadron? - Indeed, it is suspicious. - Very. - This is Fallinster. - Prevent Mr. Lempereur. Mr. Lempereur? - Wait for us! - This is a shot from Fallinster. Ouch! Ouch! Flee, Arthur. To me, they will do nothing. - Rest. - Go farther. We lost them. We'll find a host. Dwelling at this home stay. Civilians, out! Get out. Hands in the air. Where do they think they are? Outside. Excuse them. Young girl injured. Sleep... Soon, everything will be finished. We will be happy. We will no longer think about this contract. - Get up, we're surrounded.
