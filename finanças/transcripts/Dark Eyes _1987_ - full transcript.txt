DARK EYES - Good morning. - Good morning. Excuse me! - Excuse me, may I have...? - It's still closed. Sorry! It will open for lunch in an hour. Come back later. There's no one here. Excuse me... Excuse me... You've just come on board, haven't you? Yes. We travelled overland to Athens, where we decided to reach Italy by sea. I'm travelling with my wife. My wife is up on deck. She's snoozing in a deckchair. And I... I feel very thirsty. It's so hot, you know? It seems everyone's disappeared until lunchtime. Forgive my curiosity, but where are you from? Because I recognize your accent. I... I'm Russian. So-bach-ka. Have you been to Russia? Please, don't stand on ceremony. Do have a seat. You wanted a drink. Come! It's nice and cool, you know? Thank you. I feel embarrassed. There's no need! It's my pleasure. Anyhow, I hate drinking alone. I'm very grateful. You speak Italian well. Just a few words. I'm a merchant. I often travel to Italy. On business. Are you on a business trip this time, too? No. No business this time. No, no. This time, in a way... I'm on honeymoon. Just imagine, a newly wed... of my age. It sounds silly, doesn't it? No, no. I envy you because this is the nicest stage. I often think about the period when I'd just got married. A happy, peaceful time... So, you've only been married a short time. 67 days. And you're happy, aren't you? Yes, I am. Happy, very. Very happy. - Had you ever been married before? - No, no. Never. One can tell by looking at you that you're happy! I envy and congratulate you. I was just looking at an old photo, when I too was happy. Is your wife in this photo too? Yes, she's the one in the middle, you see? This is me and she's next to me. Elisa, my wife. Sorry, I didn't even introduce myself. May I? I'm Romano Patroni. - It's me who should apologize! - For what? My name is Pavel Alexjeiev. - In Italian, I'd be Paolo. - Paolo. In Russian "Roman" also means "novel". And forgive me, but also "fling", and love affairs... adultery. Here! Thank you. Where did I put them? No, I have a light. Just a moment. You see, so as not to feel too lonely I was looking at the latest photo of my wife. We took it on her birthday. Right. Poor thing. She was young. No, no, maybe you have misunderstood. No. My wife is alive, in good health, I believe. Sorry. It's just that I haven't seen her for so long, you see? I've been away from home for ages. Is this your house? It looks like a castle. And it has a park, too. No, no, it's not my house. It was my wife's. I'm from rather humble stock. My father had a small restaurant in the suburbs, but you see, I was the youngest, so my parents spent all their savings on my education. - I'm an architect, you know? - I see. - What's this? - A little gift. It's beautiful. It was at university that I met my wife. You know how it is, my dear Paolo. Moonlit nights, secret trysts, the anger of her family... The same old story! It couldn't have been otherwise. She was the only daughter of a very rich Roman banker, Salghetti, maybe you know him, who wanted to marry a penniless student. Elisa and I thought we could do without everything. We were young... and lived on our dreams. We wanted to move away from the city, to the countryside. Elisa was going to be a housewife, and look after the farmers' children... And I, as an architect, planned to carry on with my brilliant town planning project. Yes, a new term in the history of architecture. But then her father fell ill and we had to go to live with them in their villa. And... And then the banker died and my wife Eli... No. I see. And so Elisa, who was an only daughter, took over the running of the family's affairs. In the meantime, my project... Our daughter, Claudia, was born and little by little, I must confess, I got used to, ah yes, that comfortable life, the pleasure of getting up late, dressing well, enjoying a good quality cigar, of being waited on... In other words, I lived like an animal at the zoo, being fed simply because it exists. And one at a time, my other feelings became just a habit. Love included. Here, look! It's the photograph of the last happy, carefree hours spent by our family. This is Elisa, and behind her is our daughter Claudia with her husband, DodÁo. This lady in black is Tina, my wife's best friend. And this is her husband Manlio. The lady sitting down... is Elisa's mother, my mother-in-law. - Madam, the lawyer's here. - Very well. Careful! I'll be right back! - Madam, just a moment... - Later. Oh, Elisa! - Ouch! - Sorry. I saw the lawyer... - What's his name? De Dominicis. - Yes. - He looked... Did something happen? - No. - You look after the guests. - Very well. - Madam... - Later. I'd like to see her go up and downstairs a hundred times a day. Up and down, up and down... Oh, my goodness! - Madam, excuse me... - Not now! Later! - Madam... - Later! Closer to the table. Alberto, who's playing? I don't know. A young boy. Ready? Click! Excuse me, madam, for the concert do you want the drawing room chairs or the ones in the study? - Either. Ask Mr. Patroni. - I see. And tell them to stop playing the piano, please! Certainly. Yes, yes. Yes, I do wait! I understand. I understand very well. Well? It's as I suspected: a disaster. The worst of it is the manager didn't turn up for the board of directors. He didn't turn up? No? Well, he must be sick. Or he got the time wrong. I've always been intrigued by your exquisite femininity, Madam Elisa. Now I admire the virility of your character. It's best I do as you say and join my guests. Call me as soon as you have news. Now, let's see. Show me. Yes, yes, yes! No, no, no. I don't like that. Your expression. Stand like this. Head up, now down. Well done. Wonderful! Tina, Manlio! Don't disappear! We're going to take another one straight away. - Elisa! Elisa! - Mummy! Hello, Mummy. How are you? - Where did you get to? - I was here. You may go. They're having fun, aren't they? How could you marry a man like that? - He should have been a clown! - Mummy... Look at him! Who's he trying to convince he needs treatment, mud baths? - Mummy! - What a jester! He'll always be just a worker's son, a tavern keeper's son, I mean a poor fellow, who was just lucky enough to marry a rich woman! Mummy! You've been saying that for 25 years! - Please... - Yes, yes, I know. But you've never listened to me. What use is he to you? You're full of worries, I can tell, you know? But instead of helping you... he has treatments! He needs them, he's sick. And didn't you say I should not involve him in business affairs, but deal with everything myself? - Yes, yes... And to only seek advice from you? Isn't that right? - Yes, that's right, that's what I said! - Well then? But I also told you not to marry him! And you didn't listen to me. It's my fault, I know! It's obvious now, you worry more about him than about your mother! - You speak on his behalf! - Yes! Mummy, yes, I speak on his behalf. Happy now? Are you? But please, not today. Please, Mummy, don't cry. - You don't care about me anymore! - Let's move, there's a draft here. He's all you care about! You no longer care about your mother! Mummy, no... Have you seen that idiot Margherita? She came with her three nephews who climbed a tree to get a nest and broke off the branch! - Mummy, they're just children. Well, he always sings but never says hello. Who is that little angel? He's a child prodigy, Mummy. You're making the usual scene, aren't you? - Hello, Claudia. - Whenever I visit my mummy... Nice! ...I always hear bad things about my daddy. Grandma, don't you see my daddy is like a little bird? He likes to fly around, and sing... Just don't bother him with family problems... - Have some respect for your father. - DodÁo! Your DodÁo's another fine example: a bit aged, a bit bedraggled... What's the matter, Grandma, don't you like my DodÁo either? In my days we married men, not sparrows! Elisa! Elisa! - Go to the garden, I'll join you there. - Yes, Mummy. I see... Okay. Thank you, goodbye. Well! Nice present for your feast day! Listen, try to stay calm. He's nowhere to be found. How can that be? - Has he vanished into thin air? - He's run away, madam! Which means that the bank could not fulfil the payments. Splendid! We're ruined. How marvellous! You really must stay calm. Nobody knows what's happened. Tomorrow morning, we can try to sell at least some of the shares. Right, right! Elisa, go back to your guests now. But don't say a word to anyone. Understood, Elisa? - No one! - Please, I beg you! Come on! To the concert! Now! Hey, what have you done? Taken the kite without me! Where are you off to? Where are you going? No running like that! Knees higher! One, two! One, two! One, two! Where's the concert on? Where are you going with those flowers? Mr. Patroni told us to water them in the fountain. - Where is Mr. Patroni? - I don't know. - Take them back. - Yes, madam. - Do nothing without orders from me. - Very well. Come on! Hurry! - Who are you? - Don't you recognize me anymore? Where's Manlio? - Manlio who? - What do you mean? Your husband. - Oh, yes. Manlio! Manlio, hurry! - No, no. Oh, hello! - How are you, Manlio? - Well, fairly well. You probably know I bought the patent for the manufacturing of a new kind of unbreakable glass. Help me to clear the plates. Giovanni will take them away. - And put all the cutlery together. - Very well. We need another tablecloth. We'll open the first factory in Germany and then... I've a brain like a sieve! I forgot... - Sorry, I'll be right back. - Go ahead. - He doesn't seem very interested. - That's natural. You can go too, now. - Very well. - Go! - I'll get back to my place. - Here I am! Here I am, at last! - Here I am. - Cheer up, Elisa. - Elisa. - Oh, Tina. Where's Manlio? - Manlio! - Yes? There's no need. But where's Romano? Romano? Who's Romano? Oh... - Mummy, shall we start? - Yes, do. Fine, let's begin. Go on! Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends, to round off an extraordinary day, it's my pleasure to introduce you to a young genius... Mummy! Quiet! Pierre de Croisset. - Play it lively and fast. - Leave me. Won't you introduce me? Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, a sonata. I'll be right back. Romano? Romano? Romano! Oh, Elisa. What was that noise? I'm so sorry! Did I wake you up? Well... Maybe I dropped off. It's that... I feel so tired. I fear I'm unwell, Elisa. What's making you tired? What are you tired of? Whereas I'm perfectly fine. I'm not sleeping. - What is she doing? - She drinks! - Take away the glass! - It's not my fault. It's bad for you. That's all you've ever been able to do all your life! You started... 23 years ago. On my name day! What's going on? Put me in the picture, please! What's the matter, Elisa? For heaven's sake! It so happens we're facing ruin, is that clear? Our bank was the greatest supporter of Unica. - Now it's going to rack and ruin! - If you want me to stay, say so. No, go! You must have your treatment! - Go! - Anyway they're things you don't know, you don't understand! You're better off sleeping, dreaming! People are looking at us. I admit I've never taken an interest in our affairs. But the fact is you and your mother never wanted me to. Ah! It's now come to this! So it's our fault! That's enough, otherwise who knows what we'll end up telling each other. Ah, no! No! You think I know nothing and see nothing, but you're wrong! I know you well! You're a liar! A liar! Elisa, you're out of your mind. You think I don't know why you hate me. You hate me because I'm a rich woman! You only married me to get this house and all the rest, and can't forgive me my wealth. And you'll always carry on lying! And cheating me! And lying again! Elisa... How can you talk like that? Elisa! Elisa! Elisa, wait! Elisa, open up, please. Open up! Open up, Elisa! Romano? What are you doing? See? I'm measuring the carpet. - Oh, you measure carpets? - Six... - Why? - Because... - You're all sweaty! - I just measured the ones in there! Ah! I see... Every month one must change carpets! - Ah! The carpets! - You've made me lose count! - Sorry! I didn't mean to. - Where's Manlio? - Manlio? Manlio, come here! - No, no... Yes, better calling him. - We have to measure the carpets! - What are you doing? We have to help Romano measure the carpets! They change them monthly. We have to measure the carpets! We got to 6. Let's not waste time! 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... - Shouldn't we go to the concert? - No, no. ...13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30... The next day, I left. But why? Without even trying to explain? Explain what? I didn't feel guilty of anything. Of course! You went off for your cure. I mean, you were ill, weren't you? - Good morning. - Good morning. And so he... Go! Talk about losing your patience! I've never seen anything like it, believe me! It's rejuvenating! I don't want it! I don't want it! We need to work out! Wake up! Bye, Romano! Come on, wake up! Good morning! Good morning, wake up! Good morning everybody! Good morning, it's 8 o'clock! Good morning everybody! Wake up! Good morning! Go on! It's 8 o'clock. It's 8 o'clock. Wake up! Good morning! Wake up! It's 8 o'clock. Wake up! Good morning everybody! Wake up! It's 8 o'clock. Good morning everybody! Wake up! Oh, once again! Wake up! Good morning! It's 8 o'clock. Come in! Good morning, Mr. Patroni. How was your night? Oh, so-so. You know, Mr. Patroni, it was a frightful night for all of us! Our clients complained of hearing too much noise! - The General gets drunk every night. - Why's that? What happens? Confusion everywhere! Such coming and going! It's all very embarrassing. No one could get to sleep. It's a disgrace! - What is this? A hotel or a brothel? - What's going on? Call someone! I fought in three wars! In Bessarabia! In Herzegovina! I've never seen anything like this! - Come, Mr. Patroni! Come and see! - What's happening? It's a disgrace I can no longer tolerate! I haven't touched a drop for 30 years! Who's that scoundrel who for the sixth time... - Good morning. - Good morning! ...has left this rubbish outside my door?! Why take it out on me? Because it's the ninth time you failed to salute a superior! But I have a bad arm! Oh, God! In my day, you'd have been shot. It's a disgrace! What does this dog want from me? Hey, it licked my boots! - You nasty beast! Look at the ugly brute! - I'm sorry, it's my dog. Dirty too! I'm sorry. It untied itself. But it doesn't bite. Shame on you! Keep it on its leash! Oh, heavens! What a terrible journey! Tina! Today, the heat's unbearable. - Terrible. - It is! - Now, is the food good here? - Well, not bad... - Is there a good chef? - Eh, look... - And are the rooms comfortable? - Yes. I think we'll be fine here. What do you mean "we'll be fine"? - Are you staying? - Of course. - What about... Manlio? - Manlio who? - What do you mean "Manlio who"? - Oh... Manlio! - Why are you interested in him? - Well... - He's down in the West Indies. - What are you saying? - Aren't you pleased to see me? - Of course I am, Tina! Stop that! Why wouldn't I be pleased? I'm just sorry I'm not well. I... They're still keeping me under observation because it seems I have something wrong with my legs. It's as if they can't support me. - What are you saying? Really? - Yes, from time to time I feel as if my legs have a mind of their own. I'm fine... and then I'm on the floor! No, Romano! I scared you, didn't I? Why should I be scared? Tina! Stop that! Manlio's taking care of the horses. He'll be here soon. You'll be glad. What's it to do with Manlio? So... Tell me who you're sleeping with now. I came by especially to find out. Oh, it's true, your legs hurt! I'd forgotten. Let me see, I want to guess. No, it can't be... It can't be her! No, no, that's just not possible! Believe me, I live like a hermit in here. Behave, please! Joking apart, are you heading somewhere? We're going to visit Manlio's parents. Who's that woman bouncing light and disturbing you while you're eating? A Russian with a little dog. That's all I know. She's not a hotel guest, she only comes for meals and treatments. Have you seen Elisa? How is she? What's her name? I don't know! I swear I know nothing about her! So tell me, have you seen Elisa? I'm right! This time you look really smitten. What? What did you say? This time it's serious, I can feel it. Ah! Manlio's here at last! Manlio! Come and help Romano, the poor man! His legs hurt him so much, he can't walk! Hold him by the arm on this side, and I'll take the other. Come on! - Come, let me help you. - Let me lean on you. Yes, don't worry. That's it, good! No, we'll carry you! Don't worry! - Lean on me, like that! - Ouch! Slowly does it. A dove! A dove! I'll go call for a carriage! It's full of pigeons here. What? Yes, it is. - Why do you invent so many lies? - But... Tina, you know me! - You'd be lost without me. - What? It's the truth. You'd be lost without me. I have to protect you. Manlio! We can't wait for Giovanna! You'd be lost without me! He doesn't bite. Don't be afraid, lean on me. Don't be afraid, I tell you. I can manage, I assure you. No, but... No, don't be afraid. I can manage. - It was a joke! - I assure you. I know this illness. My grandmother had the same thing. Take my umbrella. I heard what you were saying to your acquaintance. You feel as if your legs won't hold you, don't you? - Yes, that's precisely it. - You must have "synevitus". - "Synovitus," isn't that correct? - I wish I could have synovitis. I have calcifications in my knees. Not actually calcifications. - They're fragments. - How did you get them? It must have been after the earthquake. Have you heard of Mount Vesuvius? Mount Vesuvius, yes. That happened before the birth of Christ. Of course, but since it's a hereditary condition... My forebears were from Pompeii. And... Fancy! Now I come to think of it! Did you know a forebear of mine was cured by a Russian lady? - Really? - Yes, but I think it's just a tale. Well, tell it to me. - No, anyhow I don't believe in miracles. - But seeing you started to tell me! It's just nonsense! Imagine someone being cured because a... Oh, please! - Well, we can try. - Right. - Whisper a Russian word in my ear. - What? - Any word. - Any word? - Yes, yes. - Very well. It means doggy. What...? I'm cured! It's a miracle! A miracle! Everything's fine! Nothing happened! Miss! Wait! It was just a joke! Last night, I knocked on your door, but you didn't answer! But it doesn't matter, since we'll never meet again! The little bird has flown away for good. No! What desperation! I'll kill myself! Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Is everything ready for table six? - Your water, madam. - Yes. Do have a seat. ...chew very slowly before swallowing! Well, it can happen. Well, you can imagine: in those days I lied with real virtuosity. But not for any particular reason or because I had to. It was just the way I was, do you understand? One day, I fell over in the street and broke my arm. I went to the doctor who asked me where I'd fallen. "In the cellar", I told him. - But why? - Why? I don't even know when it started or how long it lasted. I just remember the moment I came to my senses. - Have you never been a drinker? - I don't understand. I mean, have you ever suddenly started drinking, but seriously, for several days in a row? - Seriously? - Yes. Yes, I've done that. My wife... I mean, back then, she wasn't my wife yet... Well, she tried to commit suicide and she almost succeeded. But that's a different story. That time, I drank for 5 days in a row. I almost... - I almost... - You almost popped your clogs. So you know what the sixth day after those five is like. Oh yes, you wake up not knowing where you've been or what you've done. - Don't you get seasick? - No. You wake up... and all you know is that you're in a black hole. It's horrible. You're in a horrid black hole looking out into an abyss. Well, that's what happened to me but a long time after. I don't know whether all Russian women are like that. I don't know them. Physically, she had nothing particularly interesting, but I mean, how can I say it... She gave off a sense of purity, honesty and naÈivetÂe too. You do follow me, don't you? I was excited by the fact that she believed all the stories I told her. At five, I was orphaned and went to live with my grandfather who was alone, too. He was a very strict old man. Grandpa lived with a little sparrow: he'd talk to it, he'd call it... For example, when it was lunchtime: "Come!" And I'd call it too saying: "Come down, little sparrow, I've prepared you some crumbs." And it flew down and ate out of the palm of my hand. And I was so happy because I'd found... Her hat! Her hat! Someone catch it! It doesn't matter. I have another one. Allow me, madam. - Here's your hat, madam. - Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Push me! Come on! Go! See what fun they're having? It reminds me of my childhood. What are you doing, children? It's absolutely pouring! Come on inside! Come! He made me a scooter, you know? Hurry up! You'll catch a cold! To show you there are no tricks I'll ask one of the ladies present to take the place of my assistant. Who would be so kind? Maybe the pretty lady in the black hat? Yes? This way, please. There! Don't be afraid, meine Dame. We've never met, so I'm doubly grateful to you for your help. What's in the handkerchief? You think there's nothing? Show me, my sight is very good. Well done! What are you hiding in your bag? Let's have a look. You think there's nothing there? Look more closely! Yes, for a fling, a married lady is always better than a single one. And also the fact that she was from a distant town in Russia, something that, you know, would've simplified things... At most, I'd be reproached with a letter. The typical scenario of her turning up with a suitcase saying: "Here I am, I'm yours!" was unlikely. Or that maybe her husband would show up with a gun, bang! All things considered, I wanted to have an affair. Yes. But one evening... Sobachka! What are you doing here, all alone? Where's your mistress? Yes, good dog. Oh, God, what is happening to me? My God, what is it? Who's that? Anna! Anna, what's the matter? Why are you crying? What happened? Anna... You won't believe me, but I'm actually happy. - So happy. - Who cries when they're happy? - Romano? - Yes? I'm sorry, Romano. All this must seem strange to you. - I'm not used to being happy. - Stay calm... It's just that today, I've had a lump in my throat. That happens when you're young. - Romano... - I care for you, you know? - I feel ashamed. - You're so pretty. Do you believe me? I'm ashamed to be seen by you. You've been so kind. So very kind. And I'm so grateful to you for all you've done for me, dear Romano. - Enough... - I'll never forget your consideration. That's enough crying. I'm here now. I want to see a nice smile. You're so pretty when you smile. What's happening to me? Romano... - Don't be afraid. - You mustn't. Just stay calm. Romano, I don't... Romano... Don't be afraid. It's not right. You'll despise me now. Anna, come on... Horrible. I haven't deceived my husband, but myself. Not only now, but for a long time. Maybe my husband is an honest and well-to-do person, but... he has the soul of an old man. He's just been an old man all his life. I married him out of despair. My mother had died and my father had started drinking. He'd been sacked from the school and it was impossible for him to find another job in our small town. I had two younger brothers and we'd run out of money. The only option I had was to marry him. Or throw myself out of the window! Anna... I'd just turned 20, he was nearly 50. During the day he'd see to his affairs and I'd go to my family's house, where I'd wash, cook dinner, help the children do their homework... I'd go home at lunch time and he would eat for hours. He'd always complain about something. Then he'd start snoring on the sofa. I was afraid of him, like I was of the headmaster at our school. Yet I prayed to the Lord for him every day and I said to myself: "God sent him to you. Anna, be patient." "Think of your brothers who'll be able to complete their studies." "Think of your father who'll stop drinking." I've had my revenge now. Please, turn around. What? Please, turn around, don't look at me. Well? Have you been crying? Why? Is it possible that I will never see you again? What? Oh, Anna, I forgot to tell you what happened last night. It was an incredible scene! You know that officer who says he was wounded? He had a visit from a friend, an officer, with a face like this, dead drunk! Well, our friend was telling a lady the story of all the bullets whistling around him on all sides, when he sat down and in a loud voice, in front of everyone he said: "If you hadn't mixed beer with cognac, you wouldn't be drunk" "and those two whores wouldn't have thrown you down the stairs" "and you wouldn't be here now with your arm in a sling!" Can you imagine his embarrassment? That morning, she didn't come to breakfast. I waited a good while. Then I went out, bought a watermelon and started looking for her. Narrow is the leaf, wide is the vine, you've said your piece, I'll say mine. Hello. Oh, good morning. She's left. - Who? - The Russian lady. I came... She'd booked until the 20th, but she left this morning. - But the doctor... - Who are you? Since I was coming this way, the doctor asked me... Is it yours? - I found it near the bed, this morning. - No. Well, if it's not yours... it's mine! Naturally. Mr. Romano Patroni. Is that you? Just a moment! I see. She left a letter for the doctor. Here! "This letter is in Russian not only because I don't trust my Italian," "but also because..." Yes, but... sobachka! But... No Russian. At the spa, I couldn't find anyone who could translate the letter for me. I opened it 10 times a day, or even more. I breathed in its scent. On the other hand, what could a lady write, knowing... that we'd never meet again? A few sweet words, a subtle reproach. I thought I'd learned Russian. Anyhow, I'd already returned to Rome where... life had picked up its apparently calm, peaceful rhythm. I lived on the second floor. I would meet Elisa only at lunchtime, some occasional quarrels, the hatred of my mother-in-law... My desk was getting dustier by the day. And I thought: "In a month, the memory of this summer affair" "will have vanished like so many others." However, when the month was up, my memory of her was so clear, so precise, just as if I'd left her a minute before. Then, I had a brilliant idea, I snipped from the letter the first line in Italian with my name in it and the last one containing her signature. And with that sheet of paper I went to my old university where I was sure I'd find someone who could help me. "I'm writing in Russian because I don't trust my Italian," "but also because I think when you have this translated," "I'll be far away." "So far that just the thought of it makes me shiver." "And at that point, it will be too late to do anything." "I haven't left, I've run away." "I've fled when faced with love, when faced with..." "what I'd passionately been waiting for all my life." "I've fled because I've realised that I'm not ready for this." "My poor, poor, darling." "This is what I've wanted to say to you from the moment I met you." "My God, my God, how could I not fall in love with you?" "You're so intelligent, so kind, so very talented..." "and so understanding towards me," "a mediocre and empty human being," "who drags myself through the mud of lies and humiliation" "and cannot keep hold of this love nor hold it," "and all I can do is run away," "run away in fear, without knowing where to go." Who is this letter addressed to? Who is it addressed to? I found it among the papers of a friend who's in Russia. Oh, really? What does he do in Russia? He's dead. He froze to death. In St. Petersburg. "Now it is... almost 7 o'clock. My cases are packed and..." "I'm sitting on the chair you were sitting on a while ago." "Soon I'll walk past your windows on my way to the station." "And when you wake up, I'll already have left. End of story." "What happened, happened." "Now I'd be ashamed to have regrets and try to justify myself," "because I've been happy." "Mine was the joy, therefore the fault is mine too." "What a shame it all ended so quickly." "I'm running away." "It was too hard a test for me, I couldn't bear it." "I ask you to forgive me." Hello, Romano! Romano! Hello... - Please! - Yes, yes. - Excuse us for a moment... - He's a friend. - Would you mind, please? - Yes, yes. Yes. "I'm running away, I couldn't bear it. Please forgive me. Farewell." "I know we won't meet again," "but for as long as I live, I will never forget you." "For as long as I live, I will never forget you." - That's it. - You've not changed at all. You're still a ladies' man, you still are! But anyway, how are you? I'm doing just fine. Business is booming. How are things for you? All good? What've you been up to? Yes, I'm really happy to see you. Listen, things are great with me. After university, I got married. Then I had four children, but I'm happy. My eldest is leaving for military service, my daughter's getting married. What about you? How's your wife? - You're asking me how I'm doing? - Yes. - Do you really want to know? - Of course. - If they're not going well, you'll help? - Of course, we're friends. Things aren't going well at all! Do you understand? - But what do you care?! - What do you mean? Your family, your wife, your children, your mother, your grandpa... - If I'm in trouble, will you help me?! - Of course! You'd never help anyone, so mind your own business! "What've you been up to..." - Come, let's talk. - You're out of your mind! - "How's your family, how's business?" - Let me go. What do you care? What does it matter to you?! Do any of you here care about the lives of others? - Calm down, Romano. - I'll do no such thing! Here! Why do you think I wouldn't care? He's a friend I've not seen for a very long time. I asked him how he was and he gave me a telling off, like I'm a child, and he lost his temper! Don't worry, I haven't gone mad. I just wanted... What are you saying? Here's your hat! Gotcha! Chuck your hat in the river! Did you hear me?! I'm fine. I'm really fine, gentlemen. I'm pleased that you care about me. I'm really fine! Goodbye! Off, off, off I go! Goodbye. I remember that one night I woke up all of a sudden. I went over to the mirror and it finally dawned on me. Tina was right: I was lost. If I couldn't see Anna again, my life would be over. I was unable to get back to sleep and as soon as it was morning, I ran to my friend Manlio and said: "Manlio, do what you want, but I have to go to Russia." At first he thought I'd gone mad. He looked at me strangely and asked me no more questions. - Did you go to see her? - Yes. But... what did you tell the family? Oh, finding an excuse was easy. I'm an architect. Manlio was about to set up a glass factory abroad. He'd asked me to study the prospects in Russia. Three weeks later, with armfuls of catalogues for an almost unbreakable kind of glass, I was in St. Petersburg, where I immediately sought information on how to reach the little town where she lived. I don't know what it's like now, but a few years ago in Russia it wasn't easy for a foreigner to go from one town to another. - It's easier nowadays. - Back then, it was a nightmare. I was closely accompanied by an interpreter who had to escort me on my hunt for a permit. Or rather, for whoever would take on the responsibility of signing a permit, that document. - The travel permit? - Yes. Right! - There he is. - Did you show him the mammoth? No. He wasn't interested. - Does he drink? - Little. Then what did he come here for? He keeps on asking to go to Sysoev... To set up a factory. Of glass, I think. - You mean made of glass? - I don't know. What's all this got to do with me? You need to sign the travel permit to Sysoev. Why didn't your friend Afanasij Matveevich sign it? I don't know. He told me to ask you. - You mean he refused to? - He said to ask you. So I'll have to take responsibility if anything happens, right? An old fox! All right, I'll receive him, but I won't sign anything! Send them all away. Sorry, we're not receiving anyone. We're expecting a foreigner! - Please, leave now, sirs! - But I'm not here for myself. Madam, please leave. We're expecting a foreigner! My dear! Good morning. Do have a seat, please. Your Excellency, I'm here to show you this glass... Is he deaf? I was talking about this unbreakable glass that can withstand almost any blow. You can hit it without it breaking. Some Germans want to buy the patent, but I won't sell it to them. I'll give you a demonstration, if I may, Your Excellency. Watch carefully. You see? Look, this is an ordinary hammer, right? Look, I'm going to hit it as hard as I can. You see? Now you try, Your Excellency. You'll see. Hit it hard, please. Don't be afraid. The signature! You see, Your Excellency? It's incredible, isn't it? Please, do insist. Insist without fear. Would you like to try it? Hard! Hard! Here's the permit, Your Excellency. It just needs signing. Right. Just a little signature. Your Excellency can't sign it. He has no ink. He has no ink? - There is no ink. - In the whole building... They don't keep ink here. May I? Thank you. What a wonderful person Piotr Vassilich is. What a mind! That of a great statesman. And how clever he is in solving problems quickly! And with such farsightedness! Stop! Forgive me, my friend! Goodbye! Good morning. Excuse me, but the... Bread. It's a tradition. What? Well done! Well done! Welcome, Mr. Romano, to you who comes from so afar, with our sweet and pure hands we offer our bread to you and with all our heart we offer you these flowers too! For you, sir. If I were a poet... Thank you. ...I'd say to you in poetic form: Ancient Rome has turned its white head towards us. The Roman she-wolf has come to the forests of Sysoev! Hooray! I am not a poet, so I will say it in prose... Hooray for progress! For progress. Hooray for the factory! The creation of the civilized world! On behalf of the nobility of our town, allow me to bestow upon you, as the first foreigner to honour us with his presence, honorary citizenship of Sysoev! Thank you. Hey! Wait! Wait! HOTEL TOWN OF SYSOEV Wait, wait. You're awake! I was waiting for you. - For me? - I didn't want to disturb you. My name is Konstantin. Kosta for short! How nice to be able to speak! - They'll throw me out of here, now. - Who? I wanted to speak. Listen, I'm the local veterinary surgeon. I studied in Italy for two years, but that's of no importance. They'll throw me out of here, now, but I beg you, don't build your factory here. But I... I understand progress, prestige, increases in population... I'm not against all that. But in Krestovsky, there's clay and peat there! Try to understand. Steam engines require wood, don't they? What are we to do? Burn the whole of our... I'm coming! ...our little pinewood? The river... What will happen to our river? Catilina, how long will you go on trying our patience? Do you have to, Konstantin Stepanych? Why don't you leave people alone? You couldn't even leave our guest in peace. Use a little tact, for heaven's sake! There's a limit to our patience! You are not hospitable or even patriotic! Please, forgive us. It's our national misfortune. Our ideas, our projects... And we've come to get you. In a way, to escort you to our mayor. Your Excellency, a reception in your honour. We are ready. Stop it! My God! Send someone! Hey! Fix that fence! I can't believe it! Where's the servant? Come on! Yes! Nail it, dammit! He's never to set foot here again! Damn! He doesn't like the factory. No, he dislikes it for nature, woods, lakes. And this is a multi-million deal! Just look at that landscapist! Dammit! His Excellency says... No Russian. A little French. He doesn't speak a word of Russian. Everybody that comes here speaks it very well. - But him, not a word. - Leave, you're bothering me. I don't need you, go into the lounge. Please, follow me, before the guests arrive. Allow me to entertain you with the story of my life. Thank you. My uncle. Ah, uncle! It's me. Child. My costume. Life started... life ended... The distances... Ah, the theatre! Let's talk about business. Forgive me, my dear man. My frankness makes me suffer. What can I do? It's how I am. For us idealists life is tough. Idealism is dated now. - Now the rouble rules! - Oh, sorry. - Rouble. - Rouble? Yes, the catalyst of our century! Now if it's not a crook or a drunkard like our sergeant... It's me. ...it's a madman like this Konstantin, the one who bothered you earlier. Konstantin. It's me again. Don't trust anyone, my friend. That's advice from a friend to a newcomer. The city isn't exactly small, but there's only one honest person here. This one. What is it? What did I snag myself on? What is it? Oh, it's nothing. You just need a little... Ah! In my wife's room. My wife. We have no children, but we have a dog. Yes, in the room, wife... One can warm one's soul with some animal warmth. I understand you're looking for a financier. You can talk to me. Of course, I know I'm not the only one... to be interested in this deal. Night and day round and round and round... Earth. We're talking about a loan, right? Out. Who gave you permission to enter when I have guests? Get out, immediately! How many times have I told you? I'm sorry, Your Excellence! Madam sent me to get her cup. What cup? You've been accidentally served some tea. Take the cup and disappear! I've told you once, I'll say it again. Do not enter my study. Aren't you cute?! You're really a good little dog. Come, come. Ah, I knew you spoke Russian! Bravo. Bravo. Don't be afraid, he doesn't bite. Tell Madam to come right away. I would like to introduce you to my wife. She'll be right here. Madam apologises, but she can't come. The guests have arrived, they await you. They've arrived, let's join them. Come with me. This way, please. Please, this way. Long live Italy! Were you sleeping again?! Take the dog. What are you doing here? Leave! Gentlemen, I'd like to propose a toast to the first foreigner to ever visit our town of Sysoev! Madam... What's going on? Why are you using a tray? Do we want to show everyone I treat you like a maid? No, no, absolutely not, Modest Petrovich. I have a headache. Forgive me. Do forgive me, Modest Petrovich. Please, do forgive me. It does justice to your modesty to turn pale like Natasha Rostova in the presence of a stranger and scurry off like a shy young girl, but try to understand that this gentleman's visit is extremely important to me! I beg you, Modest Petrovich! Let me go now, please. I'll do everything I have to, but later, later. Now, I'm going to my room. I have a headache... Oh my God! Anna? Anna... Anna! Listen to my lament and lend an ear, Almighty Mother of my God. Do not spurn this sinner who is begging for Your help. Anna... Illuminate me and show me the way, Queen of Heaven. Do not abandon Your humble servant. Anna! Anna! Anna! Wait for me! Anna! Stop and listen to me! Let me have my say! Anna. Anna. You mustn't be afraid. Listen! No, no, no! Anna! Anna! You mustn't! You mustn't! Wait! Stop! Anna, wait! Anna, stop! Anna! No, no. Do you realize how far I've come? - Why did you come? Why? - What do you mean? You must hear me out. You wrote me a love letter! - Now I want to know. - Why did you come? Why? Why did you come? I can't live without you. Neither can I. Everything's simple now. You love me as I love you and we'll live happily together, Anna. I'll leave everything, but without lying or deceiving anyone. You'll tell your husband everything and I'll talk to my wife. She'll understand. I'll go back, sort everything out and then return. Anna! That's what you want, isn't it? But will you wait for me? Tell me you'll wait for me! Promise! Yes. Maybe you didn't see me. - Konstantin! - Yes, yes. I've come back to apologize for this morning's visit. - There's no need... - I talked a lot of nonsense. - No! And I probably succeeded only in putting you in a bad mood. - You didn't... - Don't think that I'm mad. I'm not against your factory, really. In Krestovsky. Yes, that's a suitable place. But here... not here. It can't be here. Costantino, that was just an excuse. I came here to find a woman. Did you find her? Yes, yes, I did! I found her. And I'm so... Yes? I must go now. I'm in a hurry! Sorry, I have to leave. Sorry... My daughter's in there asleep. I'm alone and sometimes I don't know who to leave her with, so I have to bring her with me. We've been waiting long, and she fell asleep. Sorry. You did the right thing. You were right to do so and I'm pleased. You know, I had a daughter once. I mean, I still have her, but she's grown up now. - What's her name? - Olia. That's a nice name. Now, I must finish packing. I have to leave. How are you planning to depart at night? The first train leaves in the morning. I'll manage somehow. I must hurry to Rome, I have important decisions to take. And I'll be back sooner than you think. There is a train, but at 40 versts from here. How can you catch it? You don't know what Romano's like. Wait, Romano. Romano! Wait, Romano! You were willing to walk there! It's 40 versts from here! Thank goodness, this kind man is willing to take us. How do you do? I'm Romano Patroni. How do you do? I'm Romano Patroni. They all take me for a madman here. Did you notice? - That's not true! - It is, and don't say otherwise! Try to understand, I'm not against factories, but they can't be built here. If the trees are all burned to make the machinery work, and the river dries up, it will be the end of us, our death. They take me for a madman, but I don't feel offended. They're decent people, very fine people who only want to do what's best. But like children, they grab whatever is at hand, put it in their mouths and chew up everything around them. What's happening? We're sinking. Everybody wants a benefit for themselves, something solid, now. Come on! No, no! May I be of any help to you? I'm sorry. What will this benefit do for us, no one knows and no one wants to know. - Right! I can't swim, you know. - It's shallow here. - Thank goodness. It was deeper, once. Before the dam was built. There used to be a lot of fish in it. Right! There was a lot of fish here, in the past! Yes, everything's disappearing: fish, birds... tomatoes, everything. Your home... isn't only a building behind a fence. Your home is everywhere. Even in this river, this wood, this stream. It's everywhere. And everything must be nice, like it was in the past. Beauty is the power of matter. This way, this way! Here! Stop, stop. That's it. Fine! Very good, well done! So, were yo scared? Let's go! When I was little, I never wanted to go to bed. I thought that as soon as I fell asleep the best part would start. So my mother sang me a lullaby and I blocked my ears with my fingers not to hear it, for fear of dropping off. I ended up falling asleep with my fingers in my ears. Go to sleep, go to sleep, Mama's lovely little boy. Go to sleep, my handsome child, while I sing you this lullaby. Sleep now... Sleep now... Go to sleep, go to sleep, Mama's lovely little boy Sleep now... Sleep now... Go to sleep, go to sleep, with this son, we're more peaceful Go to sleep, go to sleep, Mama's lovely little boy Sleep now... Sleep now... We rode smoothly across that soggy land, accompanied by the clanking of a bucket hanging from the carriage. In my dreams, I saw my mother and heard her voice. And for the first time in many, many years I didn't feel the weight of my conscience. Hey, you gypsies! It's me! Remember me? Romano! Romano! Gypsies! I'm off but will soon be back! I'll be back soon! Wait for me! Gypsies! I'll be back soon! Wait for me! So? What happened then? Well, then... I travelled by train, by carriage, on horseback, and then again... - Would you like one? - No, thanks. ...on horseback. I was in a hurry, I wanted to get there quickly. I had a new life ahead of me, an untainted one, without... lies, or hypocrisy. And it was like the past had never happened, do you understand? At least that's what I thought. - Good morning. - Good morning. Careful not to scratch the wardrobe. These chairs go here. Separate them from the others. - Fernando! - Welcome, Mr. Patroni. - What's going on? - Mr. Patroni... - Where's my wife? - She's upstairs. Madam Tina is with her. But... what's going on? - Three chairs are missing. - Yes, they're in the corridor. - I'll bring them right away. - You're sure nobody took them? Romano! You're back, at last! I'm so happy! - What a pity Elisa isn't here. - Elisa? What's happened? Nothing. She's with the solicitor, everything's fine. But they're taking the furniture away. Are we moving? - Oh goodness me! Don't you know? - Know about what? Your bank manager ran away. It's been a real catastrophe. - All the customers... - Excuse me... Do you mind waiting a moment? I'll be right with you. All the customers, in a frenzy, chose to close their accounts. Basically it was an impossible emergency to deal with. - Excuse me, please... - Please, stop interrupting! - Who are you? Why are you here? - Romano, calm down. One moment. You need to understand. He's just arrived. He knows nothing, he's the owner of the house and... - He's no longer the owner. - Ah, yes... Romano! - This man is the bailiff. - The bailiff? Yes, but don't worry, leave everything to me. I'll get rid of him. Listen, Elisa has decided to sell everything right away, including the furniture and the apartment. She did a great job. - She didn't lose heart at all. - Three chairs are missing. Listen, Romano, Manlio and Tina are next door. They're here to help Elisa. Go and see them, please. - Three chairs are missing. - I'll be right with you. - I said three chairs are missing. - All right, please be patient. I'm sure we'll find these blessed chairs. Just be patient! Where is he?! Where's that financial genius? - Where is he hiding? - Oh Romano, what's come over you? - Where is he? - What are you looking for? The lawyer, Domenico. The saviour of this house and family. Instead of fooling around with Elisa he should've dealt with our... their business, so we wouldn't be in this situation! - Dear daddy! - Darling daughter! Don't be silly, stop it! - Hey, what's the matter? You've just arrived and already you're shouting like a madman? We've been clearing the house for three days now! Do you realise what we're going through? - Calm down. Go next door. - Have you thought about mother, daddy? How dare you use that tone with your father! - I do dare! - Did your mother teach you that? She should show her father respect! - It's always the same old story! - This is unbelievable. That's right, you said it. It's totally unbelievable. Oh, for heaven's sake! Listen to me, Romano, you know how things stand. Unlike the others, I know why you went to Russia. So calm down and let's stop playing games. My God! Even though she's not well, Elisa hasn't lost heart. But unfortunately, to pay off all creditors, she's selling the house and furniture. Manlio and I are writing up the inventory and she's showing the house to potential buyers, but it's a disaster. How could she trust that lawyer wholeheartedly? She should have... Why are you looking at me like that? You're a true friend. What's the matter? I'll miss you. - Do you know what "sobachka" means? - No, what does it mean? - Excuse me, I... - We'll continue later. I think I'll give you a big surprise today. - Good morning, Romano. - Oh, Manlio! - I need to talk to you. - Yes. - Wait, I'm talking to him. - No! I need to speak to him now. Right away, Tina. Tina. - Go ahead, Manlio. - Listen, Romano... I helped you to go to Russia and I cannot forgive myself. You know, I'm unable to lie. And anyway, I don't like doing it. Don't ever ask me to do such favours for you again, please. Wait, Manlio. You can't imagine, you saved me. Don't worry, I don't need to lie anymore. - But... - You'll find out the truth today. So will Elisa and she too will find her path, just as I have found mine. You'll see. This is a valuable billiard table. French, genuine. I'm willing to leave it, if you're interested in it. It's nice. Nino? This is the room we use for music and here we've a very fine piano I'm thinking of leaving. - I saw it first! - That's not true! It could be useful for the children. Children, be quiet, please! Elisa! Romano! These people are here to look over the house. They'd like to buy it. Good morning. - May I take a look? - Of course. - Morning. - Good morning. Nino, are you coming? The bedrooms must be here. - Good morning. - Good morning. Ida! Ida! What you wanted 30 years ago: no house or money. Just you and me. - How are you? - Fine. - What was your trip like? - Sorry? - Was your trip interesting? - Oh yes, very interesting. - And it was cold, wasn't it? - No, not at all. Sorry. - What did you go to Russia for? - Sorry? I found this while tidying up your things. - Did you read it? - Of course not. It's in Russian. It's scented. I don't know, I don't remember... Perhaps it's the one about the "technical" features of the glass. - Romano? - Yes? Why did you keep this letter? Elisa, I didn't keep it! It just got left there. Other times, you threw letters away... What kind of a question is this? If there were an answer... Children! What's going on? What's all this noise? What's happening? Shall we buy the puppies on the first floor, too? - Let's ask Daddy. - No, ask Mummy. The best thing is asking Daddy. - Children? - Here's Mummy. - Yes, Mummy! - Tell her I'm coming right away. Let's go and visit these puppies. But first of all, don't give them anything to eat, it might be harmful to them. I'm coming. Behave nicely and... Romano... For once in your life tell me the truth. Exactly what do you want to know? - The truth. - Which truth? All of it. Very well. You won't regret it, afterwards? Do you want to know everything? Fine, but you have to swear you'll never ask me anything again! All right? - Yes. - Swear to it! If I swear to it, will you then tell me the truth? - Yes. - I swear. What do you want to know? Are you in love with some woman in Russia? No. Never happened to me. Forgive me, darling, but I'm so tired! Things have been difficult and I missed you so much. I missed you terribly, dear. - What's that? - A Russian record. Oh, interesting! And then? What happened? Then... Naturally, I never went back to Russia. I returned to my old self. Little by little, my wife's affairs improved. She even received an inheritance from an uncle in America she didn't even know she had. She got back her house, her furniture, her money and I... Now, I'm here. What about her? Who? Her, the other woman. The Russian. She loved you and was waiting for you. Maybe she's still waiting. But it's been eight years! Her little dog must be dead by now. In any case, what actually happened between us? If something happened, what was it? No one will ever know. I mean, heavens, who remembers people from the past? You just have to think like this to have a quiet, peaceful life. You're free to think what you like about yourself, it's your right, but it's not the same for everyone. My dear fellow, open your eyes! Open your eyes, look around you! This is the 20th century! Who bothers about other people? Who waits for someone? Nowadays, I mean? I do! I do! I'm an insignificant person, a nobody, one who counts for nothing. But I want to say something else. I've known my wife since we were children. I mean, she was a child. I'm considerably older than her. She moved away with her parents and got married. The marriage didn't work out. The same old story, you know. Seven years ago she came to Moscow. She was living with an aunt and the situation was grim: problems in the family, financial hardship... I never asked her anything and she never told me anything. In a word, I fell in love with her. I completely lost my head. I waited outside her house day and night, like a high school boy! I brought her flowers, I was jealous... I feel ashamed when I remember what I did! But a major factor was that she didn't love me. She'd never loved me! And even when she attempted suicide, when I saved her in the nick of time, she was unconscious for five days, I saved her, but even then she said... She cried and cried, she kissed my hands, but she had absolutely no interest in marrying me. So I started drinking heavily, but that's another matter. In seven years, eight proposals of marriage and she turned them all down. The ninth time, when I was stupefied by my love for her, I threw myself at her feet, she knelt beside me and she kissed me on the forehead saying: "I don't love you, but I'll always be true to you". And she accepted my proposal. And I accepted that humiliating condition enthusiastically. Enthusiastically, you understand? Because I'm worthless, a coward, as I already told you. Nothing to make me be loved, but nothing is ever lost. Not one day, not one gesture. Everything stays with us until we go to our grave. And probably even beyond. This ship will rot, this sea will dry up, but the good we've done, the harm we've caused will always remain somewhere. I've lived every day as if it were a trial run. A rehearsal, telling myself and others: "It's just provisional, it's a trial". "Life, real life, will come later". And later, there was nothing. It was like a sort of joke, a game, like something unreal. I... I've had everything and nothing. Not a real home, nor a real family. Not even my daughter who is... the spitting image of me. I don't remember anything. If I died this instant and the Good Lord asked me: "Romano, what do you remember of your life?"... The lullaby my mother sang me when I was little. Elisa's face on our wedding night. And the fog in Russia. Romano! Have you lost your mind? In a quarter of an hour, lunch will be served and you haven't even laid the tables! It'll all be ready in two minutes. I met a friend, we were in the war together in Africa. If they throw you out again, I won't lift a finger to save you. It'll all be ready in five minutes. You can go now and return in a quarter of an hour. I'll be waiting for you. Go and get your wife and I'll prepare you a lovely meal worthy of two newlyweds. Go! Go on up. Your hat and stick. I understand. I understand. Romano, we'll be back shortly. Sweetheart... It's time to wake up, sweetheart. Now I'd like you to meet someone. What time is it? Half past two. How long did I sleep? You'll see, an incredible destiny. He's been to Russia! Let's go. - Right or left? Which way? - Right. - Here we are. - Yes, I'll be with you in a moment. Here are your drinks. I'll come back soon! Gypsies! My friends! I'll come back soon! I'll come back soon! Gypsies! My friends....
