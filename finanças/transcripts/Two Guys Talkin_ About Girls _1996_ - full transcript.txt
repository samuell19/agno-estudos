Man: Yo, Roxy, can we get a couple of cheesecakes over here? Roxy: You got it. Man: Sex, Lenny. Sex, go ahead, say it. - Lenny: No. - Man: You didn't get any, did you? Lenny: Hey, hey, hey, we only had three dates. - Man: You told her you loved her. - Lenny: No, I didn't. - Man: Yes, you did. Yes. - Lenny: No, not exactly, Joe. It's not that simple. Joe: Sex is not something you should try and defend yourself against. If it feels good, do it. Lenny: If you take a perfectly rational guy and dangle a beautiful girl in front of him, he will do anything. He will swan dive completely off the deep end, sex or no sex. Joe: Yeah, right. Speak for yourself. Lenny: Didn't you ever try to consciously not like a girl? And you're going out with her and then there's this-- this moment where she just gives you this smile like, "It's okay, go bald, get fat, watch football in your underwear, I will always love you." Even though she's probably thinking anything but, and it cuts right through every one of your defenses. A smile. A smile just like that and you're dead. You're just like this grinning idiot. Joe: Why would I ever try and not like a girl? Lenny: I don't know, stay in control, keep your edge. Joe: Hey, a girl wants you to like her. That's why she puts up with you in the first place. You like her, she feels good about herself, you feel good about feeling her. Lenny: Oh, well, so much for the platonic approach. Joe: Hey, hey, let me tell you something. Plato got laid, all right? Probably a lot. Lenny: Okay, Mr. Philosophy, do you know who the Greek god of wisdom was? Joe: Where are you going with this? Lenny: It wasn't a god. It was a goddess. Her name was Athena. Joe: Yeah, and each year she'd fly over the pumpkin patch in a G-string and Wonderbra and drop little presents down to all the boys and girls. - Give me a break, Len. - Lenny: You have no respect for women. Joe: I've got respect for women. - You've got no respect for yourself. - Lenny: Eh, blow me. Joe: Hey, girls do not sit around diners talking about guys. They're out there, they're on the other side of the booth in the real world. Lenny: You watch. The right girl is gonna fall out of the sky one of these days... Joe: Every girl for you is the right girl. Lenny: No, you are overreacting here. Joe: Let me tell you something, next time you get hit by one of these meteors and you don't follow through, I am gonna make you do something about it. Lenny: Okay, fine, Joe. It won't happen again. Man's voice: Throughout the millennia, man has gazed up at the heavens, yet it wasn't until the age of space exploration that we learned what a cold and desolate place the universe really is. The Greek philosopher Plato said that if man is to find his brethren among the spheres of space, that he had best be prepared to make the trip alone. Are we truly the sole masters of our fates? Will we ever receive a sign from a brilliant heavenly body? It may take a lifetime of effort, but the search for intelligent life continues. On Long Island? You got to start somewhere. Guide: Please follow me. Okay, step right up. You're next. [ chatter ] Okay, move up. You're next. Yes. Woman: The graduate program's okay, but they teach straight from the books. Lenny: That's why you come here? That's one reason. [ owl hoots ] Weren't you here last week? Me? No, no. Yeah. Yeah, I wanted to meet you. I'm glad you did. So what now? - So, um... - Yeah? Is it all right if I give you a-- a call? - Yeah. - Okay. - Wait, you need... - I kinda need your number. ...my number. Rhonda. There. See ya. Bye. [ engine starts ] [ honks horn ] - [ coin drops ] - [ dials phone ] [ line ringing ] Come on. Aw, come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on. Come on, already! - [ phone rings ] - [ gasps ] - Hello? - Joe? Joe? - Hello? - Joe, can you hear me? Lenny? Uh, Joe, you're home. Lenny, what's the matter with you? - [ woman moaning ] - Lenny: Did I wake you up? No, no. I was, uh-- I was-- I was doing aerobics. - Aw, nuts. - Why, what is it, buddy? It's nothing. It's nothing, I'm sorry. Yeah, right, sorry, my dimpled ass. - What you got? - Look, never you mind. Look, I will call you back. I got you at a bad time. Yeah, it's too late for that, Len. What do you want? Could we do the Hilite? The Hilite? Lenny, it's a quarter after... whatever it is. I was trying-- I was doing aerobics, you know? I know. All right. Give me 20 minutes, okay? - What? - Thanks, Joe. - Hey, I owe ya. - Yeah, I know. ♪ One, two, three... [ blues music playing ] - Hey, Joe! - [ honks horn ] ♪ I ain't got no woman... Lenny: Thanks for putting up with me. Joe: So who is she this time, Len? I mean, you're having sex with somebody and I call you up to bitch? Not even, to make that rant and rave about some ineffectual, mindless, meaningless-- What, are you in love again? Oh, don't I know it. - How you doin', boys? - Hiya, sweetie. - Hi, Rox. Pair of coffees. - Gotcha. - Make his a decaf. - A decaf for him. - Mm-hmm. - Hey, that's not just a good idea... All: It's the law. God, I love the way she walks. - So when I called you... - Yeah? ...who were you in the middle of? Cindy. - Cindy? You gotta be kidding me. - Yeah. I thought she moved back to Jersey. No, that was Cindy Three. Wait a minute, wait a minute, you seeing Cindy Two again? Cindy Four? Oh, that's nice. I suppose with one more, you win a free toaster. I hope. Come on, Len, what's the problem? The problem is... there is no problem. No, there must be, or else you wouldn't have dragged me out here in the middle of the friggin' night. Is that new perfume you're wearing? - Yeah, it is. - That's great, I love it. I'm telling you, Joe. I think this girl is it. After talking with her for 20 minutes, I'm tacking my last name after her first name. I'm beginning to imagine what she's gonna look like in maternity clothes, for Christ's sakes. Look at this. What the hell is that? She drew her name and number on my hand. Oh, that's sweet. I know what you're gonna say. - Yeah. - Don't. "Take it easy, don't worry about it, one day at a time," jeez. What do you mean, "jeez"? That's my advice you're trashing. Joe, I don't want to ride the brakes when I'm going downhill. This girl-- oh, this girl is so sweet, I could eat her for lunch. I'd give her the moon, if I could. [ quietly ] Pedestal alert. What? [ enunciating ] Pedestal alert. Pedestal? We're talking friggin' skyscrapers here. I feel like I'm back in college. Oh, no, not, uh, what was her name? Sharon who looked like a fish? No, no, no, no, no. It was Lisa with a nose like a penis. - Yeah, she was cute. - Here you go. Hey, I'm talking here. - Thank you, thank you. - Thank you. Why don't you have some cheesecake? You'll feel better. Okay. - Joe, I met this girl... - Right, right. ...at the planetarium, you know? You know what I'm saying here? - How many girls go to planetarium shows? - I don't want to know. I just don't want to screw this one up. Don't worry. It happens all by itself. Wow, I never even mentioned Cindy One. - Neither did I. - You didn't have to. You got the twitch. - Oh, I got a twitch now? - Yeah, you got a twitch. - I ain't got no twitch. - All right, you don't got no twitch. Cindy One. See? So, you fuck her? What? Who? Rhonda who I'm fond-a. Joe, I can't-- I can't believe you. What did you want me to do, right there in the planetarium? - Yeah. - Yeah? Oh, you're right. I'm sorry, you're right. You're right, you're right. You just met her. Did you hold her hand? That's rich. Please, take my heart. Spit on it. You want my car, too? - No. - You can have it. I'm not gonna need it after I lay my body down in the middle of Route 347, you freakin' slug. Yeah, well, if all I wanted was your car, I woulda just taken it. What's over there? - What? - 10:00. Thanks. What are you gonna do with that? Joe? I'm gonna get your mind off of Rhonda. Joe, you got no confidence and it's-- it's sad. Hey, how you doin'? [ speaking quietly ] - Roxy: Anything else? - Man: Nah. Cindy Four. There. [ laughs ] There? There what? There, I got us both dates. - Both of us? - Mm-hmm. Wait a second. I told 'em your brother just died, okay? - So they feel sorry for you. - You-- my brother? I wasn't aware I had a brother. Exactly, so that way you can't get caught, all right? Now drink your coffee. Hey, don't forget I got us that date Sunday night. Oh, no. D-d-don't make me go on this date. What am I gonna say to these girls? You know anything that comes out of my mouth is gonna sound like a lie, so what's gonna happen? They'll talk to me for a couple of minutes, I will buy them a lot of drinks, I'll stand there and squirm, and then they'll just move off to the next guy. I say hi. - Hi? - Hi. H-I, yes. - Hi. - Hi. No, you did not just say hi. It's what you say when you're saying hi. Me, I say hi and it's, "Hi, how you doing? No, I'm sorry, I am bothering you. I will go away now." You, you say hi and it's, "Hi, how ya doin'? No, no, it's okay to stare. I'll just condescend and grace you with my presence. Hi." You just need the right attitude, Len. Is that what it is? - Beautiful women... - Yeah? ...more insecure than ugly ones. Really? Well, then Rhonda must be very insecure. You need to loosen up. How's that, Joe, better? I'm serious. You look like you slipped a disk. Loosen up, use your shoulders. - Feels good, doesn't it? - Oh, my God, you see that? - That's all right. - This is phenomenal. [ exaggerated New York accent ] Hey, Rhonda. Hey, it's me, Lenny. Yeah, look at my shoulders. - I take Visa... - Whoo. - ...MasterCard... - Hey. - ...American Express. - Watch out. I do mothers, daughters, pets, small pets. Small household appliances. Appliances? Stay away from the jukebox, all right? How you doin', PJ? Good to see ya. Come on. ♪ ...walkin' down the street with money... ♪ Joe: What, what is it? Why are you so quiet all of a sudden, huh? No, I'm not quiet. Really? [ yells ] I'm not quiet! I'm telling you, if you mention Rhonda, I will hit you and it will hurt. What? What is your problem? I'm here, I'm having fun. Yeah, well, I can't have you going off about Princess Leia, all right? I told these girls we'd meet 'em here. All right, okay, okay. It's just-- okay. All right, where are they? Oh, there they go. Look at 'em. I'm telling you, a woman is like an engine. You gotta take care of it, you gotta lubricate it, you know what I mean? It's just instead of using 10W-40 stuff, you buy 'em a drink, you know? Instead of just letting them sit there and idle in your driveway, you know, we should dance with them, don't you think? Dance with them. Come on, man. - Okay, let's rotate some tires. - All right. What are you doing? Come on. Why don't you, uh, take 'em for a test spin and I'll, uh, spectate? Yeah, I plan on giving 'em more than a test spin, all right? Come on. What are you doing? Dance with them. Maybe, um-- maybe I don't want to dance. - Why not? - Because, you know, we just have a-- Because what? Because they're not hot enough? - Because-- no. - Huh? Because they're not smart enough? - I never said that. What are you talking about? - She looks very smart. - Because the pedestal ain't high enough? - I never mentioned Rhonda. - Ta-da! See, you want to go see Rhonda? - No. - Hey, let's go see Rhonda. - I don't think so. That sounds like a plan. Let's go see Rhonda. - No, what are you-- - Excuse me. You two, you look great tonight. Your mother must be so proud, both of you, really. Great. He's gonna have to call you some other time, okay? All right? After he grows up. Come on, Pokey, we're outta here. Um-- um... Joe: Oh, nice neighborhood. You sure you can afford this? [ Lenny whispering ] Joe, I don't want to be here. Len, I don't care. Listen, you're gonna be real quiet, right? Oh, yeah, yeah. You mean like no noise, right? [ squeaking ] Joe, I'm not amused. [ squeaking stops ] Is it raining? You're an idiot. - All right, let's go. - Go where? Joe, Joe, Joe, it's the middle of the night. I know. Joe, come on. Don't be doing this to me. - It's a nice place. - It's a very nice place. But, look, if you want to meet her that bad, I'll arrange a brunch next weekend, okay? Let me check first. - It's cool, I wanna check for a dog. - Can we go now? All right. It's a nice place. I like it. Don't, Joe. Shh. No, no, hey. Would you relax? - Don't-- - [ clatters ] - Put it-- put it-- - That's smooth. Joe. Set it down. Could we-- - No. - You wanted to be here. No, I-- Joe! You go up there, I'm not following you. I'm not going. Oh, for Christ's sake. Come on. Oh! Hey, hey, hey! [ dog barking ] Come on, come on. You're a pal, you know that? Come on. You all right? [ door opens ] [ cocks gun ] [ distant train horn blowing ] Ho. Both: Ho. I see that Second Amendment's very big around here. So's that gun. You all right? Great, never been better. Good. All right, let's see if this is open. No, I don't think so. Enough is enough. Can we get out of here now? - Is that her? - Yeah, that's her. - Redhead? - Yeah. - Yeah, okay, let's see if it's true. - No. - Yes. Come on. - No, no. - Why not? - I will slam your fingers in this window. - No, you won't. - You're not going in there. Let go, let go. It's open. It's open. She's practically begging us to come in. She is begging. Can you hear it? "Lenny, Lenny." Trespassing, breaking-- Come on. [ rattles ] Okay. All right. What-- what do you think? - That's her? - That's her. Yeah. Okay, you've seen her. You've smelled her. I'm not gonna let you touch her, so can we get out of here, please? Hey, she likes sheep. - Put that down. - [ bleats ] - Joe, no, no, no. - [ kisses ] Paul, cut it out. Paul? Paul? Excuse me, who's Paul? Oh, she's so beautiful. What are you doing? What are you doing, Joe? [ jingling ] Lenny. Hey, Len. Hey, hey. Put that back. [ moans ] Kiss me. She wants me to kiss her. - Kiss me. - Should I kiss her? Paul, I love your tongue. Paul again. [ both moaning ] [ spraying ] [ screams ] Oh, God. Go. - [ shotgun cocks ] - Father: Rhonda? - Can we go now? - Go where? Jump. You son of a bitch. - [ seagulls squawking ] - [ blows horn ] Joe: You know, last time I saw a sunrise like this, I hurt my back. Lenny: Yeah? Doing what? Joe: Cindy Two. You know, the sun's probably streaming through Rhonda's bedroom window right now, just waking her up so she can remember how much she hates me. Lighten up, would ya, Len? That's okay. I never wanted to see her again in my life anyway. Yeah, yeah, you and Paul, huh? Hey, drop dead, would you, please? Look, Lenny, she was half asleep. She won't even remember anything ever happened. All I know is when she was kissing me, she seemed wide awake. Right, so when you talk to her-- Oh, it ain't gonna happen, Joe. No, look, Len, when you talk to her and she mentions anything, you know, deny it. - Right. - You repeat it back to her, you see. She says, uh-- "No, honey, I was in your bedroom Sunday night? No, I would've loved to have been in your bedroom Sunday night. But, see, we've only had one date. I was kinda hoping to save that for the second date." See? See how it works? Sounds so stupid, she'll never believe it. Drop it, okay? - She had nice tits. Two of 'em. - Joe. Look, I appreciate the advice. Really, I do. They're jewels, pearls of wisdom. But it's late-- make that early-- and I gotta go to work. Some of us do work, you know. [ scoffs ] Yeah, right, Len, like you're going to work. - Work, Joe, you ever heard of it? - Yeah. It goes something like this-- yesterday was Sunday. That makes today... - Monday. - That's very good. Oh, man, it's 6:15 in the morning, Joe. Gives me just enough time to fly home so I can fly to work, push papers like a frickin' zombie trying to land this stupid account. That's right, it's a stupid account. What do you expect me to do, Joe? - Call in sick. - I don't think so. No, no, no. - That may work for you. It ain't gonna work for me. - All the time. Well, you can't go in on no sleep. Oh, come on, Len, when's the last time you called in sick? - I don't know. - Exactly. See, you're way past due. Joe, the office ain't even open yet. I know. That's why you're gonna call your boss at home. I don't think-- I don't even like talking to her at work. Come on, you told me her number spelled out something like K-K-K-NAZI. Don't do this to me. Come on, put the-- Hello, Edith? Please hold for Lenny Kaminski. Viral encephalitis, okay? Makes you sound like shit. Hello? Oh! God! [ groaning ] God. Edith? Yeah, it's me, Lenny. Listen, I'm sorry to call you so-- I do? Well, yeah, I'm told I have... - [ whispers ] Viral encephalitis. - ...viral encephalitis. I-- I don't know. I think I got it when I was knitting. - Fishing. - Fishing. Yeah. [ groans ] Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. You, too. Bye-bye. - What'd she say? - She gave me a bonus. - She gave you a bonus? - Yeah. - You're buying breakfast. - Okay. - Hey, hey. - Hey, what? You just kneed me in the balls. - So? - So?! - It hurt. - Hey, so does viral encephalitis. - You were great, man. - Thank you. Don't thank me, man. Thank the Academy. That was a brilliant performance. - Joe? - Yeah? - Blow me. - Okay. [ engine starts ] [ tires squeal ] [ doorbell dings ] - Looks like a diner. - Smells like a diner. Okay, you calm now, Pokey? Yeah, I'm calm, I'm calm. I feel like a ballet dancer, but I'm calm. Don't call me Pokey. I hate that name, Pokey. - May I help you? - Well, may you ever. Oh, may I puke? Will that be two? - Two what? - Two people. Oh, yeah. Unless you're joining us. [ laughs ] No. - Follow me. - Okay. - All right. - All right. Jesus. Um, do you have-- do you have any more gum? No, I'm-- I'm sorry, this is my last piece. Oh, okay. That's all right. I haven't seen you here before, have I? - No. Is this it? - Yeah. See, you couldn't have because I woulda asked you out on sight. [ laughs ] Stop. Please. I'll be right back to take your order. Okay, thank you. God, I love the way she walks. What's with you? She's 16. I'm giving her practice for when she gets older. I mean, I love 'em when they're that age. She's got no pores. She's got no driver's license. - Would you take it easy? - I'm sorry. I just feel like I should be at work. Well, I feel like I should give you viral encephalitis. - Pair of coffees? - Yeah, make his a decaf. - Decaf for him. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. - It's not just a good idea... - It's the law. - I think I'm in love. - I think I'm in hell. How did you know about "It's the law"? I don't know. Well, look at him. You give him regular coffee, I'd have to get a spatula to scrape him off the ceiling. He looks like he's playing hooky or something. Yeah, I'm Joey. You sure are. I'm Angel. Hi, Angel. This is my friend Lenny. He's-- he's not really playing hooky, are you, Pokey? No, no, see, I came down with a case of viral syphilis this morning - so I called in sick. - Oh, yeah? You look it. - Pokey. [ laughs ] - You like that? What are you having? I want six eggs, scrambled, please. Okay. - How are your pancakes? - Good. - Okay, I'll have those. - Okay. - And, miss? - Yeah? - Don't call me Pokey. - Okay. Oh, gosh. Sorry. I got those. Okay. I like her. These are the worst pancakes I've ever had in my life. Look at these eggs, Lenny. They're light, they're fluffy, they're like clouds. Look at that. - Jesus, Joe. - What? I coulda had perfection with Rhonda. Instead I had to go screw it up worse than these pancakes. Don't worry about it, okay? Your pancakes are fine. And you ain't gonna look back on Rhonda with any regret. And if you start to mention Cindy One again, you're paying the tip. Hey, hey, hey, you are the one who brought her up. That's because I can. You see, I'm over her. Oh, I see. Nothing scares you. You have no fear of rejection. Look, Len, if you don't think about getting scared, there's nothing to be scared about, you know? Hey, how you doing? All right. - You know, I mean, if you're so worried... - Joe. - ...about how some woman is gonna say, "No, Lenny"-- - Joe, Joe. - What? - You actually know somebody out here? Mm-hmm. Friend of yours is sitting right over there. Mm-hmm. Oh, that's nice. I needed a shower. - Oh, God, oh, God. - That was good. - I think she saw me. - You want me to ask her? I'll call her over here. - Hey, Rhonda! - [ blowing raspberry ] Now I'm at the circus with the elephant. - Shh. - What are you-- [ both shushing ] She definitely saw me. I'm thinking she saw me. Do you think she saw me? I think you're overreacting. I mean, you should just relax, go on over, say hello to her. Look, now she's sitting with her grandmother. Kiss her on the cheek. They love that. I don't think I'll be kissing her grandma, Joey. I'm not wearing my riot gear. You're forgetting everything I told you. Now you be calm, you play it straight, okay? She won't even believe it herself. - Now go. Go. - No. No. You got about five seconds before this blows up in your face. Five, four, three, two, one. - You're not gonna go? - No. - You sure? - Yeah. Okay, stay right here. That's good. These eggs, boy, they're going right through me, Len. I gotta stretch a little bit. What are you gonna do to me, Joey? - Don't be embarrassed. - Please, Joey, I'll give you my car! Hey, I think it is her. Is your name Rhonda? You can have my stereo, I'll throw in my golf clubs. You can have my VCR. It doesn't record too well on the slow speed, but you're good with it, so five minutes is all it'll take. - I'm pretty sure it's her, Lenny. - You can fix it! Shh, here she comes. Hi, do I know you? No, I don't think so. Uh, I think you know my friend. Hi. - Father: Remember this place, Ma? - Grandmother: Uh-huh. Hi. I thought that was you. Yeah, it was me. See? What are you doing here in Massapequa? Don't you have to work today? Yeah, yeah, we were just having breakfast. Oh. Why don't you join us? Good, yes. The food is good. Why doesn't-- she should join us, Lenny. You gonna introduce me? Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Rhonda, this is my friend Joey. - Joey, Rhonda. - Hi, Joey. - How are you? Good to see you. - Joey, nice to meet you. Um, I'm here with my parents. Yeah, um, my grandmother's in town. She doesn't really do too well in diners. Why don't you have 'em come over and sit with us? - Lenny. - Yeah, why not? How you doin'? The pancakes here are top-notch. Oh? Well, um... let me see if they mind if I sit with you. Okay. - I'll be right back. - All right. How do you like that? She doesn't suspect a thing. - You were right. - I'm always right. I mean, is this phenomenal or what? Now I can just-- no, I cannot. - What? - I cannot go through with this. - I mean, I'd be lying. I got to tell her. - You can't be serious. I got to live with myself, Joe. And I got to live with you. I mean, this ain't your frickin' wife we're talking about here, okay? This isn't the right time for you to have some kind of a crisis of conscience, all right? All I'm saying is she might appreciate it, you know? I mean, look how nice she's acting now. Sure, look and cherish it, okay? 'Cause it ain't gonna last. Just because it didn't last for you doesn't mean it won't last for me. And, okay, I got the tip. Yeah, that's right. Okay, now, be cool. You're doing great. She's on her way back already, look. - Oh, I think you got a problem. - What's that? Isn't that your boss coming in right behind her? I got it all covered. What the hell? Oh, Pokey, Pokey, Pokey. Hi. Hi. So, I guess that's a yes on the breakfast? - Sure. - Good. Edith: It's a good thing he doesn't work for me, I'll tell ya that. Don't you have to work today? - No. - Joe: Yeah. - I have off. - He's working late shift. Into the late shift and then I'm gonna go in. Oh, I thought you work for a consulting firm. It's tax season. No, it isn't. Isn't it? Corporate tax season. - Corporate. - Fiscal... quarter. Quarterly. Fiscal corporate. Fiscal corporate tax. Mm-hmm. Four times a year. - Oh. - Sure. [ sighs ] - Are you okay? - Sure, yeah. Why, you good? Why? - I don't know, nothin'. - All right. - Lenny? - Yeah? Where were you last night? Rhonda, you know, you're probably pretty hungry, I bet. Angel, honey, you wanna help us out a little bit over here? Are you hungry? You know what's good here? Eggs. - They're fluffy, like, uh-- - Clouds. - Clouds, yeah. - Lenny. - Yeah? - Where were you last night? Why do you ask? Because... you know, everyone thinks that I'm crazy. Nobody thinks that you're crazy. We're crazy. Thanks. You're a nice guy. But where were you last night? - I got to tell her. - Lenny, Lenny. Tell me what? Joey, she oughta know. I oughta know what? Last night... I was with you. In his thoughts. He was thinking about you all night. All the way down in Setauket. - What? - Really? - Joey. - Lenny. - Jesus. - So why does everybody think you're crazy? Oh, I don't know. I thought I... oh, you know, now I don't even believe it. Oh, Rh-Rhonda, don't cry. - Don't cry. - No, no, no. Even Paul doesn't believe me. - Who's Paul? - Yeah? My cocker spaniel. Both: Oh, God. Oh, God. Rhonda, don't-- don't-- shh, don't cry, shh. - [ whispers ] Joey, give me a tissue. - [ sobbing ] - Here. Here you go. - Okay. Uh... here. Thanks. Shh-schmuck. Rhonda: Thanks. Lenny: Better? Oh, hey. Looks like you're not the only one who called in sick today. - Who called in sick? - I-- I did. You did? Oh. Oh, wait, but I thought that-- Angel, honey, could you get our friend some coffee? And maybe some tissues would be nice. Yeah, sure. Whatever you want. Joe: Okay. Hey, Lenny, how does your friend take her coffee? Lenny? Oh, man, I hate to do this to ya. Do what? No, not the-- [ groaning ] - Lenny, are you okay? - He's okay. Come on, Pokey, it's time for your pill. - Pokey? - Pill? Yeah, Rhonda, honey, you wanna help me out here? - Yeah. - Just squeeze his cheeks. Pops them right open like a frog, all right? - Go ahead. Come on, open it. - No. - There you go, there you go. - Lenny, what are you doing here? - Ah. - [ gags ] - I told him to stay home. - Help me. You're his boss, right? Edith? We met once. Joey Fortone. [ Lenny gagging ] Lenny, are you saying that you actually tried to make the meeting today? Help me, help me, help me. - [ thuds ] - [ groans ] You fuck. Fuck. - Fu-- - You mean someone phoned you? Someone sent you a fax? - I think what Lenny means-- - Did I ask you? - No. - Then don't answer. - Okay. - What are you saying, Lenny? That you found out where the meeting was and you did all of this after you were diagnosed with viral hepatitis? He didn't really say that. Excuse me, he might as well have. - You're right. - Thank you. Will you get up, please? Thank you very much. - [ groaning ] - Lenny, look at me. Did you put this meeting before your own health? - Yes. - Oh, Lenny. - Oh, Edith. - You are a team player. - I know. - Wait a minute. I thought that you called in sick. What is going on here? You're right. Angel, you're right. I did call in sick. I mean, look at this guy. I couldn't leave this guy alone - on a day like this. - Don't-- [ groans ] I stayed up with him all last night. He was delirious. I don't know, all he talked about all night was you. Me? Come on, Lenny. I gotta get you outta here. - Come on, come on. - No, don't. - Come on, come on. - No. No. - Here we go. Come on, I gotta get you-- - No, no. Come on. Here you go. - Come on, here we go. - Oh, God. Angel, how much I owe you? Oh, no, no, no. It's on the house. Here's my number. Call me. - Okay. - Let me know how he's doing. Yeah, he'll call you, he'll call you, I'll call you. - Okay. - Okay. - [ groans ] - I can't believe you. Shut up, you're doing great. I wanted to have kids, you son of a bitch. Thank you, everybody. [ groaning ] ♪ Cisco Kid was a friend of mine... ♪ We made out okay. Oh, we did? I don't think I've been this humiliated since I threw up on Tia Lockland at our senior prom. I didn't know you drank that much. - It was on a boat, Joe. - Oh. Hey, we got free breakfast. She had on a white dress. I got Angel's phone number. It was her grandmother's. - You got a bonus. - Little pink flowers on it. Rhonda digs you. - Yeah, you think? - Yeah, I think so, really. Now, I'm not a psychiatrist, but that shit with the cocker spaniel, weird. I'm telling you. I mean... Paul is a cocker spaniel. Paul is a cocker spaniel, yes. - Hey. - Yeah? What was that pill that you gave me? Well... [ chuckles ] - A marble? - Yeah. You gave me a marble? You got a bonus. To eat? You eat this one. Eat it. Eat it! [ birds chirping ] Lenny: Oh, I want to pass out, I want to die. Joe: Yeah, well, do it in your own apartment. Oh, I forgot I was on sacred ground. I'll take my shoes off. Thank you. Hey, you straightened up. Your maid come today? Hey, not bad, huh? Okay, I'm gonna take a shower. You can borrow some of my clothes. You got anything clean? - What do you think? - [ clangs ] Ow. [ groans ] Oh, boy. [ shower running ] Yeah, Joe, you're over her. [ dialing ] [ line rings ] Rhonda's voice: Hi, this is Rhonda. Please leave a message. Rhonda, hi. Rhonda, hi. - [ line beeps ] - Rhonda, hi, it's me, Lenny. How you doin'? I was-- I was just thinking about you, so I thought I'd call. I hope that's okay. Yeah, yeah, so I thought I'd just use up a little more tape on your machine. But what's new? That much, huh? Well, I must sound like an idiot. So what else is new? Uh-huh, uh-huh. Well, nothing real new to report on this end either, so I was just calling to say hello and hope we could get together soon. All right? Okay. Bye-bye. Hopeless. Hopeless? Give me a friggin' break. What? What, you got the lamest girl phone voice I ever heard. No, that is a good girl phone voice. At least I don't crank up the bass like you do. [ low voice ] Hi, babe. Michael Bolton opened up the set, but we'll be back with some more fabulous love songs right after this. [ normal voice ] Was this another marble? Take a nap. We got a 12:00 tee-off time. [ spits ] Hi, Rhonda, this is Lenny. I was just thinkin' about you and, you know, I was-- I was jerkin' off. Oh, gosh, I hope that's okay. [ golf club whooshes ] Lenny: This is the last hole. We've been playing for eight hours. Joe: Have you made a par yet? Lenny: No, that's 'cause you're keeping score. Hey, whatever happened to Melinda Shore? Oh, thank you for reminding me. Worst blind date I ever had. Go to pick her up at her parents' house, all these relatives waiting there. It's like "Night of 1,000 Jews." I'm trying to remember prayers from my bar mitzvah just so I can fit in with these people, so I could have something to say, and I'm thinking to myself, "What the hell am I doing here?" When all of a sudden, there she is at the top of the staircase, Scarlet O'Haraberg, weighing in at a svelte 250. Jesus. It was a perfectly good night of my life I'll never have back again. What about you? - Don't do blind dates. - Oh, yeah. Shoulda known. You did her, though, right? Oh, nope. Nobody went down by the shore. She was a virgin. [ sighs ] Not after rush week. - Hey. - Hmm? Remember that Paul Simon concert in Central Park? Yeah. There was 500,000 people there. A half a million people. Do you remember what I said to you that night? I said, "Joe, look at that crowd because somewhere in that crowd are our wives." I remember that. I still believe that. What, did Rhonda tell you she was there? Cindy One was. Well, so much for your theory. I don't know. Maybe just wasn't the right time. Oh, you're dancing. You're dancing. I don't know if you can hear the music, but you're dancing, baby. Let's go home. That was a wonderful day. Yes, it was. I'm proud of you. You finally played hooky. - Wonderful dinner. - Yeah. - Was it as good as the marble? - Better. Better. You are a wonderful date. Thank you. - Don't think you're getting any off of me. - No. Let's get the hell outta here. No. - No? - Mm-mm. Come on, it's 9:55. It's Monday. So? So, ladies drink free after 10:00.

So, look, we were thinking about leaving. - You wanna come along? - Cindy Five: Sure, where you going? Yeah, where are we goin', Joe? We were gonna go over to, uh, Lenny's place. It's a lot quieter. No, I don't think that was part of the itinerary. - Joe. - We always usually go back to Lenny's place after we hang out... You usually are full of crap, Joe. - We're not-- Joe. - Oh, I'll bet it is.

Um, okay, well, I hope you're okay. I know you're sick. So you should be home. - Um, well, I tried calling you earlier... - I'm here. ...but I kept getting your machine, and generally I hate talking to answering machines, but I don't know when you're gonna get home.

She hung up. Really? Great. [ dialing ] [ busy signal ] Great. Thank you. Thank me? What did I do? What did you do? I don't know. You come here and invade the sanctity of my home. You act like some sweet librarian, you say maybe two words to me all night, you attack me without any provocation whatsoever, and just when I get a phone call from the one person who has deemed never to call me in this century, you leap out of your way and screw it up beyond any hope of reparation. That's what. Don't mess up my house. - What happened? - Did I hear singing? Cin, you look like a yogurt, okay? Where's Lenny? I don't know. Some girl called. Rhonda. Bitch. Two-timer.

You're welcome. I was, um-- I was hoping you could take me to Massapequa. - Massapequa? - Yeah. [ laughs ] Lot of violence in Massapequa. Violence? I, um-- I thought Massapequa was kind of a safe town. Not for hitchhikers. You know, I don't-- I don't really need to go to Massapequa. - Actually-- - You haven't been following the news, have you, son? News? Yeah, people are saying there's some kind of psycho driving the highways around here just looking for hitchhikers... to take down and do 'em. You know. [ chuckles ] Do 'em? I once saw a young kid about your age, had his whole damn trachea cut out with a fishing knife. [ chuckles ] Oh, God, what a mess that was. You ever gut a deer? No, I don't suppose you have. You look like a city boy to me. I tell ya, that thing was hanging down the front of his shirt there and it's all bloody and everything, looked just like a piece of ziti. Piece of ziti? Yeah, you know. Baked ziti. Now, look, you redneck, shit-stomping son of a bitch, you don't scare me! - Rude little bastard, aren't ya? - I've been walking this highway for four and a half hours. I have been kicked in my groin at least a half a dozen different times. I think the girl of my dreams has been French-kissing a dog and I ate a marble! Now please pull your piece-of-shit car over to the side of the road before I rip out your trachea and we get to see what kind of food it looks like! Didn't your mother teach you not to talk to strangers? I didn't have a mother! You have yourself-- oh, my God. [ panting ] Oh, my God. - See you later. - Thank you. [ exhales sharply ] [ dog barking ] - [ tapping on window ] - Rhonda? [ quietly ] Rhonda? Rhonda, it's Lenny.

Oh, Maxwell. - [ kisses ] - I got the wrong room, lady, I'm sorry. - They said you were gone. - I'm sorry, don't have a heart attack. They said you were gone. They said you were never coming back. Don't have a heart-- I'm not back. Oh, please, please, tell me everything. - I've waited so long. - Shh, shh, shh. Oh, oh, shh, I see. - It's a secret. - Yeah. How did you escape? How did I escape? How did you get out of Iwo Jima? - Iwo Jima? - Tell me everything, please. - Oh, I've waited so long. - Please, please-- shh. - How did you escape? - Shh, shh, shh, please. It was horrible.

No. So, who were you talking to? Was it Willard Scott? Or maybe the bumble queen. It's Maxwell. He's come back. How is Dad? - He's fine. - Yeah. - I'm hiding him from the enemy. - No. I see. [ sniffing, whining ] Oh! Oh! And is the enemy nearby? Uh-huh. Would you like me to kill 'em for ya, Ma? - [ gasps ] - [ imitates gasp ] You all right? Grandmother: I'm fine, Lester. Oh.

Oh, and good morning to you, too. Morning, my ass. What the hell is wrong with you? What-- where'd you go last night? I tried to see Rhonda. - You did? - Yeah. - What'd she say? - I don't know. But I finally met Paul. You wanna smell him? No, no, that's great. Hey, you want a bagel? I don't want a bagel. No, I got bagels for you. Now, look, I'm impressed. You mean, you tried to go see Rhonda last night even after I set you up with that librarian? You know? Lenny, you ain't never done anything like that before, man. So, uh, why'd you come here to look for me instead of going to your place? You were with a girl last night. Why would you ever stay? Ooh, that hurt. [ knock on door ] Come on in, it's open! Cindy, how you doin'? This is-- this is my buddy Lenny. - Lenny, Cindy. - Hello. - You want a bagel? - Where were you last night? I was working late, why? Because you said you'd call. No, I said I'd call, you know, if I wasn't working late. Cindy Four: That's not what you said. You said you'd call me, so I sat home all night waiting for you to call and you didn't call. That's because I was workin'. That's not what Liz Campanella says. She said she saw you out with some girl last night. Cindy, don't pay any attention to what Liz Campanella says, all right? Cindy Four: Well, I'm paying attention, Joey. I'm paying lots of attention. I care about you. I just want to make you happy. You did. I am not... some cheap toy for you to play with, Joey. Don't you care about me? Can we talk about this later, please? No, I want to talk about it now. Cindy... look, we spent some time together, all right? I mean, we saw the stars, the moon, the fireworks. And now the sun's come up and it's another day. So just relax, all right? You're such an asshole. I gotta get to work. What, you don't want-- you don't want your bagel? [ cartoons playing on television ] Oh, my God. Oh, thank you, Joe. Sorry, I used all the hot water. Man: Hey, Len, I thought you were sick. Huh? Hey, Lenny. Welcome back, man. Thank you. - Missed you. - Thanks. Welcome back. Thanks, I'm feeling... a lot better. [ chuckles ] - [ intercom beeps ] - Edith: Lenny, you in there? Yes, Edith.

I just... wow. Yeah. Wow. - How long has it-- - It's been a long time. Look at you. You look... great. I've been working, Lenny. Does he know you're in town? No. - How long you here for? - Till tomorrow. I just came in to take care of this. - Tomorrow. - 2:00 plane. That's too bad. That-- that barely gives you any time to catch up. It's been a long time. I-- I don't even know if I want to catch up. What are you doing later tonight? No, no, hear me out. How about we all get together, we'll go to the Hilite for a coffee? - I don't know. - It'll be fun. - I'll pay. - [ laughs ] - [ doorbell rings ] - [ dog barking ] Lenny. Hi. I thought you were sick. I thought I was, too, but I'm better now. [ dog growling, barking ] I got to ask you a question. Yeah. What happened last night when I called you? Oh, that was some girl that Joe goes out with. Uh-huh. You know, a lot of people have worthwhile causes-- save the seals, save the rain forest. Joe likes to save the nymphos. So when I called, that girl was with Joey. Yeah, yeah, I tried calling you back, but your line was all busy. Well, I was trying to call you. - You see? - But when I got through, you weren't there. Well, yeah, I was trying to come here. Why? I wanted to see you. - You did? - Yeah. Hey, what are you doing tonight? What do you got in mind? I'm trying to fix Joe up with this really great girl. - Like a blind date? - You could call it that. [ phone ringing ] - Hello? - Lenny: Hey. - Hey. - What are you doing? I'm, uh, fixing the sink. Didn't you have to work today? Half day. You know, I-- my beeper's broken. I gotta get a new one. So what's up? - I need your help. - What's the problem? Well, um, I'm getting together with Rhonda tonight. Oh, get out. Yeah? Well, what do you-- what do you need my help for? I'm a little nervous, you know? I was just thinking maybe if you drop by just at the beginning, sorta smooth things out for me, huh? Okay, all right, where you meeting her? - Where do you think? - [ laughs ] - 8:00? - Sounds good. [ lawn mower whirring ] He ain't gettin' any. [ music playing on loudspeakers ] You know, these two friends of mine, they met on a blind date just like this. Well, this is a little different. Well, the fundamentals are the same if they're counterparts to each other. Like, if he's a Sagittarius and she's a Pisces, they're just gonna line up. So you're into astrology as well? Yeah, astronomy, astrology. They're really the same thing. Really? Yeah, one guides the world, the other guides what's in it. You weren't at that Paul Simon concert in Central Park a couple years back, were you? No. No, I hate Paul Simon. Oh. - Hey, Len. - Hey, Joey. You remember Rhonda. - Hi, how you doin'? Good to see you. - Hey. - You got a second? - Yeah. - Yeah, come here. - Excuse me. Hey, look, I know you wanted me to drop by for a few, but I didn't want to be a third wheel, you know? Aw, come on, don't be stupid. And seeing as how I just played kiss-and-make-up with Cindy Four-- - What? - Yeah. Yeah, I guess none of that woulda happened if you wouldn't have been there when she went off, you know? Kinda made me feel like a real ass, you know? Yeah. So, look, she's on her way down. You mind if she joins us? - Here? - Yeah, she's on her way down here. - Now? - Yeah, do you mind? I don't mind. It's great. All right. You okay? - Yeah. - Okay, great. - All right, come on. - Good. So, how's everything going with you two? You hitting it off all right? Yeah, it's going okay. We were just talking about the planets. Wow. - Planets. - Yeah. [ sighs ] So how's everything going with your latest cause? Good, good. What cause? Oh, you know, all your women. - Saving the nymphomaniacs. - Lenny? Rhonda, I don't think Joey wants to get into that right now. No, I think Joey does want to get into that right now. But you got more things on your mind right now, right? Hey, you know, I don't think he looks nervous. No, you don't look nervous. No, I don't. Why would I? Why would he look nervous? You mean he doesn't know about the blind date? - What blind date? - He knows now. What the hell's going on? Hello. Cindy? He knows her? Cindy. Hi, Joey. Hi. Sit down. So... So... - So... - So, this is it, huh? This is the help you needed with Rhonda? What help? It's been real nice, okay? - But I gotta go. - Joey? Cindy. - Is she the blind date? - Lenny: Shh. What are you doing? You enjoy hurting me? Cindy, I didn't do anything, all right? 'Cause I caught you before you could. - It's not what you think. - I know what I think, all right? And you telling me not to listen to rumors. Well, I don't have to 'cause I can see for myself. So, did he tell you you were special, too? All right, that's enough. Don't blame her and don't blame me for shit I didn't do, okay? If you want to blame anybody, you blame him. - What? - Asshole. Yeah, that's right, Lenny. All I ever do is cover your ass for you, you know? And then you trick me into coming down here, man. Why couldn't you just tell me the truth? - Tell youthe truth? - Yeah. Because, Joe, you wouldn't recognize the truth if it bit you on your ass, Mr. My-beeper's-broken- I-better-get-a-new-one. Mr. Let's-sneak-into- Rhonda's-bedroom-in- the-middle-of-the-night. - Huh? - Yeah, that was us. Mr. Feel-sorry-for-Lenny- his-brother-just-died. I didn't know you had a brother. I don't. So this is how you repay me, huh? You wanna punish me? Lenny: You think I'm doing this to you? You schmuck, I was doing this foryou. I figured maybe, just maybe, you might be so sick and tired of screwing around every night, you might want to fall in love. Do you remember Cindy One? She wasn't Cindy One until you spent the last four years of your life trying to replace her. Know something, man? Fuck you. [ sighs ] Yeah. Who was the blind date? [ chatting ] Mm, Mr. Businessman, uh-oh. Nice mess. What'd you have to carry? What-- what kind-- okay, that's heavy. - You should know, you're-- - Cindy, look, I was just thinking... - [ dial tone ] - Shit, shit. Yeah. No, I just-- I mean, use a balsa or something like that, you know, 'cause you gotta be careful with that kind of thing 'cause that could hurt you for, you know, future stuff like that. - [ line ringing ] - Cindy.

I said I was sorry. - No, you didn't. - Yes, he did. Yes! I did. He actually apologized to a girl that he hasn't spoken to in two years, but me, his best friend, a guy he sees every day? He treats me like shit. Yeah, well, what goes around comes around. Oh, well, that's real good. Well, I'm rubber, you're glue. Whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you.
