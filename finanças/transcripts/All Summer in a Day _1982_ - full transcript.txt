Please stop! Do the scientists really know? Will it really happen today? It's supposed to What time? At 12:15 sharp... ...give or take a few seconds I wonder what it's gonna be like Probably like the last time stupid! Oh! What was it like last time? How am I supposed to know, I was just a kid I'm a little scared Me too So am I What are you all so scared about? Nothing happened to us last time, right? We're still here, right? What do you think you're doing? Can you hear it? It's letting up Listen! No it's not! Besides, Mrs. Callahan put me in charge She told me to make sure that everyone goes under the lamps...and that includes you! But the sun's coming out today So what? So we don't need them Yes we do, we always need them Well not when we have the sun... Don't you know what the sun does? Yes, I know what the sun does... but that doesn't mean that you don't have to go under the lamps just like everybody else You think you're special just 'cause you're born on Earth? What is it William? What is it that can't wait til I get to class? Margo won't go under the lamps Well why not Margo? Mrs. Callahan... Today I want to wait for the real sun! I want to talk to you for a moment Margo Will the rest of you get ready for class? You got a lot to do before the big event Alone William! I can't believe it's really gonna happen Margo... I know how much you've been looking forward to this, but... Don't let your hopes get too high You know sometimes nature can be fickle It's been nine years since the sun paid it's last visit And then it was only for an hour! Well I don't care if it's only for a minute I understand how you feel But you still must go under the lamps! Do I have to? Yes I insist There you go, just like the real sun No it's not! How do you know? Cause I remember No you don't! Nobody remembers! I do Margo...Why are you hiding that, it's beautiful! I don't know. It's not exactly the way I want it to be Mrs. Cal... Class! I want you all to look at this Margo, tell everyone about your painting Well, I tried to make it... how it looked when I lived on Earth... in Ohio There was sun all the time I can still see it, but... I just can't paint it right How lucky you are to have lived on Earth long enough to remember the sun so vividly Now we have to keep our fingers crossed for the rain to stop and for our sun to shine on our planet so that we have lovely memories too Just like the Earth,we're the only planet that can sustain life in our solar system because our sun is close enough to keep us warm Mmmm... Paula! Um... Our sun is mostly made of hydrogen and helium and the center of it rises to... twenty-thousand degrees Count again Paula! Count your zeros Oh! Twenty-million degrees! No, I don't think so Paula according to my calculations, it's exactly Twenty-million-three-hundred and one thousand degrees Paula, what would we do without Michael? William? William, it's your turn! What? We were talking about the sun Oh yeah... Uhhh... Th-The sun is made of...two gases One is hydrogen... Nevermind! Margo? Hey, I'm not done! William... You know you're supposed to contribute something new about the sun and not repeat what has already been said Now please pay attention Margo? The sun is like a flower... that blooms for just one hour... and, fills our world with light... and leaves us feeling bright Oh that's lovely Margo! Did you write it? Yeah! It's a poem It's just lovely! Margo? Do you wanna take a look outside? Thanks! Oh, doesn't look like it's going to stop Matter of fact, looks to me like it's coming down even harder! Right Michael? Oh yes Precisely 1.5 times harder than it was an hour ago But we still have almost two hours Well I say it's not going to stop... I say the sun's not going to come out at all! William? Why do you hate me so much? Why? Because you're such a know-it-all! You may have Mrs. Callahan fooled... but you don't have me fooled for one second! You've never seen the sun! You've never, ever seen it! Still think it's gonna stop? Michael... Paula... Mary... and Lisa Margo... you still have a little time left Alright children... I want you to pay attention this is very important! Open up your sun kits... and take out this green visor and I want you to wear this visor at all times Now put it on your heads C'mon Very good Now...do you all have this green tube in your kit? This creme will protect our skin from the harmful rays of the sun William... would you please put on your... Thank you Alright now, take the top off of the tube... Apply it generously to the palm of your hand... Rub it in Everyone doing that? Put it on your face Miss Callahan? your neck Miss Callahan! What is it William? I hate to say this but, I don't think we'll be needing any of this junk! That may be true William... but if the sun comes out... What do you mean if? Don't you believe it's gonna happen? Don't you? No, she doesn't Well I don't care what anybody thinks! Will... Margo, I... How do you feel now, bigshot? I guess the scientists were wrong this time Well what do we do now? I don't know, I... I hadn't planned any other activities Margo? Margo!... I'm sorry Margo... I really am That's ok Paula... I just wish you could've seen it What's all that? Eh, just stuff from when I lived on Earth Is that a butterfly? Uh-huh, it's a Monarch I've never seen a real one before You need the sun to have 'em What's that? A flower I mean, it WAS a flower My mom used to grow hundreds of them in our back yard Margo? What's it like when the sun comes out? Well... the clouds separate... and there's music from the birds and crickets and you feel like running and spinning until you're dizzy and it's hard to catch your breath It is? Because you're so happy Mmmm... Margo... Do you ever wish you could go back? Sometimes... but not now I wish I coulda seen it...the way it used to be It's too crowded there now Can you hear it? What? Listen! I don't hear anything Listen! The rain! The rain's stopping! It's gonna happen! It's gonna happen! The sun's really gonna come out! Aren't you excited? Well isn't anybody excited? Where's Mrs. Callahan? Around She went looking for you I'll go find her Oh, my sun kit! Hey! You can't do that! That's not fair It's just a joke, we're gonna let her out in a few minutes Right Rain-brain? That's right... We're just having a little fun... simply a harmless diversion, nothing more William!!
