Look who's here… The half-female… What are you looking at, bitch?! Fucking lesbian. What the fuck is she doing…?! What the hell are you doing, bitch! What the fuck is she doing, oh! Stop! I'll catch you, bitch! Go! Watch out for the offside. Get in position, come on! Anyway, Luca is the one who has to buy the condoms. There's no way I'm going to the pharmacy. Or we could go without. Awesome. Then you can be on TV in "16 and Pregnant". Idiot! Me? Until the house is empty we can't do anything anyway. My parents never go out. Why don't you use the locker room? I don't want to catch some disease! You're such a prude! And you wouldn't prefer to have sex in a proper place? All the guys I've had sex with have had their houses free actually. Because you like old men, dear Cuttlefish! I like men, Koala! Anyway, Luca won't last more than 8 seconds. You can hold your breath for 8 seconds, right? That way you don't have to think about the locker-room. Wait... wait... wait... You.. suck! Fuck off! Idiot! Ok, change! Next two! Come on, concentrate! Fight! Fight! Fight! Zenasi… Come here a moment. Good job. I've heard from the National CT You've been optioned to play in the women's National team. Yes! Awesome! So what now? So, if everything works out, this time next year you'll be wearing the national jersey! Great. Tell your mum that we'll have to go back to Trento for training. Of course. In the meantime… No more crazy antics with the boys… No circus acts... - No bar fights... - Ok. I got it, coach. Good. See you tomorrow. Dinner's on the table. Did you make tigelle bread too? Yes but only enough for customers. Here you are. Thanks. This is good. Coach Galli said I've been shortlisted for the national women's team. Really? Fantastic. I'll have to go back to Trento for more training to confirm my place for next season. Good job. Listen, Dario's mother called me. From the team. And? So I don't like you acting crazy with a BB gun and then having people from town coming to complain to me. What were you trying to prove? Just that they're a bunch of assholes. If you have any issues with the other players you have to talk to the coach about it. Or come to me. Mum, there's no problem, ok? No problem? So why are you going around shooting at the boys then? You have to show you're better than them even if they make fun of you... I know, I know. You already told me hundreds of times. And you still haven't got it. It is you who's responsible for what's happening in your life. You continue to create these situations for yourself that you can't handle. You aren't thinking about your goals at all. Alright, I get it… I've had enough of this. Did I say you could leave the table? Get back here and finish your dinner. - No no no… leave me alone! - Don't move What the fuck are you doing? Let me go! Don't move! You're hurting me Shut up! Stop it! Come on, lock her! - Leave me alone - Ok, let's lock her here Fuck! Don't move! Do you want a lollypop? Leave me alone! Come on, suck it Fucking lesbian. Let's do a selfie! Come on guys! Loser. - Say cheese… Check this out! Great! - Say "hi" to the girls on the national team! - Go fuck yourself… Now we're even Zenasi. Let's go. Assholes Unlock me. Don't tell me you didn't see that coming. I'll only open the lock if you do something for me. Open this fucking lock! You have to promise. Want one? What the fuck do you want? Your mum's lodge, it's only open on weekends, right? Why? Vanessa and Luca need it for a few hours. Your mum doesn't need to know. We can go whenever you say. Look… We're even now… Let's end it here. Now that you're free you play hard to get? Remember we can have you tied up like a dog whenever we want to. Forget it… let's go Hi! Hey! Let's hope the weather will be fine for Easter. I've already called five masters for the "Gong Bath Meditation" in the forest. Is there also anything to eat? Put some water on the stove. Nice scarf… Someone lent it to me. I used to use one to hide hickeys too. Gross, Mum! Come on, I'm kidding… And I'm not in the mood for jokes. Are you going to reiki class tonight? No, I'm going out. With the tall, flabby guy or with the dwarf? First of all, Marco is an architect And he's actually started going to the gym. Wow… Whatever… If you don't start shaving though, you won't get any sex tonight. Do you know you're an asshole? Eh… I wonder who I got that from… Hey man… you know If you were going to get a haircut, you could get a decent one… You look like a fucking emperor penguin! Who's your hairdresser? I mean… Did you really pay for that? You gotta have guts to pay for that… Because… you know, if you paid for that… Woah… fuck you Oh, enough with that water! Come on it's just water… Pass me that bottle. You suck. Oh Zenasi, did someone let you off the leash? Go go… stretch! Come on, in line… Good job! Come on, let's see if you can fight or if you're a girl. Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Enough! Enough! Stop it you two! Are you out of your mind?! D'you want to risk getting hurt during practice? Great… Come on, that's enough for today. Everyone in the locker-room! Zenasi, you wait here. What are words worth to you? Nothing. Is there something inside here?! You can't throw it all away like this. Do you know how long you'll last in the national team? One day. Then they'll send you back home. Oh, do you understand? Yes, I understand. Can I go now? Go and change. You can go to the lodge, but you have to make Luca stop bugging me. When will it be free? My mum only fills up the pantry on Wednesdays and I take care of the dog every other day. Anyway... why can't you do it at your place? Or Giada's place? The lodge or nothing. It's safer. Oh. Don't touch anything, don't eat anything and don't mess things up. And bring your own sleeping bags. Wanna watch a movie? Is everything fine? Yes it is. Come on guys push on those stairs! Faster! Faster! Come on guys! Faster! Faster! Come on now, keep going! Hi! I wanted to thank you for the lodge. Ok. I have to go… You can give me the keys another time. - Ski champion dies in mountain accident...- - Antonio Zenasi crashes off-piste in the Dolomites - Nana! Hey! Hi… fetch! No then. Come on…! Mum? Are you home? Ouch! Stop it! Shit… You really hurt me! What the hell were you doing underneath my bed? You said I could keep the keys. Yes, but not that you could come here again. I wasn't doing anything bad. I see… Look what you've done... Do you have any ice? Fuck the ice! You're insane… - "The skating coach is so beautiful…” - Give it to me. - “…and she always smiles at me.” - Give it to me. - “..I want to be her boyfriend." - Stop it - Wait, wait, here it gets better… - Oh! Stop it! - "And here attached is a piece of her...” - Give it to me! You are such a loser! Leave it! - Ouch - Let me go… - Ouch! Let me go! - Fuck! Get off! - Stop, you're hurting me! - Give it to me! - Ouch! - Shit! - Stop it! - Fuck! - Give me the diary! - Let go of me! Get out of here! Get out of here! You should put ice on straight away, now it's fucking useless. Sorry if I came here without telling you. I just wanted to be alone for a while. Yeah, alone with my stuff.. I was bored. Well, no one asked you to come here! You've got a lot of friends. Couldn't you go to Giada's? No, because no one would think that I'd be here. They think you and I can't stand each other. They're right. Also, she's a pussy. She would've said everything right away. Everything… what? What are you saying? Nothing, that I just want to be on my own. You're the only one that doesn't give a shit about what other people think. You don't mind neither if Luca call you half-girl or fucking lesbian. Yeah, I don't give a shit what you think either. Wait! Take this. I'm sorry… Listen, my mum is coming soon. We need to leave. See, you can do it. Do what? Not doing stuff just because people tell you. Saying no. Sure I can… but I piss everyone off that way. I can't do it. That's good, that way you won't piss anyone off. When I went to the lodge with Luca it wasn't good. Did he do something bad to you? No. I don't think so. It was just like something you want to stop but don't know how. And did you tell him? No. Did you draw all these? Hmm. It's the world underneath the ice rink. It's a sort of "upside down" like in Stranger Things And they have to find the way out. Cool. How does it end? I don't know yet. I want you to draw me as a boy. Why? Because. Ok. “The main erogenous zones on the male body are well-known.” - "..But maybe..." - No! “Not everyone knows that…” Please… “…There are unsuspected spots...” Gross! I don't want to know that stuff! - "The perineum. Caress it gently” - No… I love when you listen to me. “Then when he is about to come…” Holy shit! "Press harder..” Oh gross… “Orgasm will be mind blowing!” Yikes! What's that perineum?! The perineum, it says, “is between the balls and the asshole.” Are there really people out there doing these things? Eh Zenasi… You don't know anything. I bet you never even kissed anyone yet. How can you possibly know what guys like... I don't care what guys like. Because you're a lesbian! I'm not a lesbian. And it's much better to not have kissed anyone rather than sleeping with someone then regretting it. Say you're sorry. No. Say you're sorry. Your aim sucks! Ok, try again… What the hell! I'll show you. Then… Load it… Reach your arms out and hold it like this. Wow! Who taught you? My Dad. A long time ago. He used to do biathlon. I'm sorry. About what? That you lost him. It was a long time ago. And? And nothing, it just sucks to think about it again. Now you try. Careful not to put your thumb behind the magazine, otherwise you'll hurt yourself. Is your grip strong? Hmm. Aim with your better eye and pull the trigger. Mmm not bad. Idiot! Here, better if you do it. Why don't you go in? He's already done the roll call. I don't wanna play. Vanessa won't answer me. Me either. Since we went to the lodge. Maybe she's grounded... Maybe they took away her phone. For what? I don't know… For having sex? What the hell are you saying? Maybe she's sick. She's not at school. What do you want? Nothing, I was taking a piss. Have you seen Vanessa by chance? What the fuck would I know, she's your friend. Why? Get the fuck out. Hello? Vanessa? Fuck! You nearly gave me a heart attack! Why are you laughing? Nothing… I just wanted to tell you there's food in the pantry. Cheese, bread sticks… Ah ok… Thanks a lot. How is it going? Fine. Ok. Ok. Goodnight. …Night. OK give me your arm. I'll do a tattoo only if you do first. OK. Look. Now it's your turn. Don't get me drunk. I've got training later. I'll finish it then. If everything goes OK, next year I'll be on a real team... Then you'll have to change in front of girls… They're not gonna give you a locker room of your own... Anyway, a locker room for me doesn't exist. It's as if me and other people live in a different world. Whatever I say it never comes out right, whatever I do is always wrong. With each step forward I make three hundred steps back. It's like I'm trapped inside her. Everyone says Zenasi, the lesbian one. But when I look into the mirror I see Zen. A boy. Sorry I'm telling you all this random shit… I believe that Zen is a boy. Maia! Oh, Zenasi! Wanna sit with us? So, is Vanessa coming? Who knows. Otherwise we'll start without her. Her mobile is broken. Maybe she found someone who fucks better… You're an asshole! Come here… Say you're sorry! Leave me man! Leave me, come on! It was a joke… What's up? I was kidding man… Fuck, leave me alone! I was joking! You'd better have been joking. Anyway, Vanessa's parents called mine... Did they call yours too? Stop talking about Vanessa! Who's starting the challenge? Maia. Nope. Yes. Come on, the yellow one. Lemon or fart? - No guys, I don't feel like it. - Come on! - Nope. - Need to feed you?! Oh man, hold her still. No, guys… Fine, I'll do it! Let's see if you're smart enough to pick the fart one! So? So? So what?!? Is it good? No, take another one! Come on, eat another one! It's the same! Give it to her, then! As if it was different… It's disgusting! Down! Down! Down! Shit! Swallow it! Swallow it! Come on! Gone! Great! Dario! Dario? What's Dario? No! Me? Why me? It's your turn. Come on! You do it! Good morning kids. Good morning. Before we start our lesson, Agent Bernini needs to make an announcement. As you may know, your classmate, Vanessa, left her home two days ago to come to school. But that day she was absent. And nobody has seen her since. Maybe she'd had enough of school… Her parents... We don't know why she left. But we want to make sure nothing bad happened to her. If she said anything to you.. If you've seen her… That morning or in recent days… Come and speak to me in private. Any small piece of information could be useful. It's important for each of you to help out in any way you can. Vanessa's parents are extremely worried. And we don't want anything bad to happen to her, right? Thanks, Agente Bernini. Thank you too. I'll be available all morning, here at school. Bye. Goodbye. Yes, Zenasi? I don't feel very well. Can I be excused? Of course. Let's start with the first chapter… Hi Zen! You have to call your parents. It's out of control. The police came looking for you at school... I think Giada's going to tell them everything. What does Giada have to do with it? What does Giada have to do with it? She saw the tattoo. You wanted it. Yes, I did, but I didn't know it was the same as yours! I don't give a shit. About what? I don't give a shit about what Giada, Luca or my parents think. I'm not going back to the village just because other people tell me to. And when do you think you will? I'll decide when. And I don't want to go back home now. My mum is coming back to the lodge tonight. And the guests too, you'll need to find another place anyway. I don't want to get you in trouble. Then promise you'll never tell anyone you were here. - And that you did this to me. - I promise. But before I go I want to take you somewhere. D'you think I'm normal? Seriously? Is that a serious question? I don't know… Just the fact you're asking me… I don't know… I mean… As far as I can see, yes, you are… I guess… I guess you are. Because you're different. Ah… like… abnormal? No. Just different in a good way. Beautiful different. Sorry. Maia… Can you give me a ride? Where? Downtown. We can come back together. It's already open, I have to work tonight... Everything is fine. Was it Maia? She kept me locked up in the lodge. You're safe now. Was it Maia? She kept me locked up in the lodge. Maia! Maia! Open the door… Answer me... What the hell have you done now? Maia! What am I supposed to tell the national coach in Trento? Maurizio... Before you rush into any decisions, let me remind you that it is my daughter's word against Vanessa's. I know, Sandra. But this thing is starting to get too big to handle. All eyes are on me, even the police chief came to see me! Yes, but I didn't do anything! She's the one who wanted to hide out at the lodge. - How many times do I have to tell you? - And it was a stupid idea. It was just a stunt. I don't understand what hockey has to do with it. Sandra, I understand that it's difficult for you to move past this, to keep everything under control. But I have the parents of the hockey team who are threatening to pull their boys off. What am I supposed to do? Shut down? They're a bunch of jerk offs anyway. Enough of that! Listen… Maia and I have talked about this at home… And we've come to an agreement. Maia is willing to move to Trento by herself. She doesn't need to keep on training here... But you have to give us a hand. Mmm… How about this… …Let things cool off a bit... Let's let it go for this year. Let's talk about it again in September, maybe we can find some other girls to train with... Maia! - Go away. - I just want to talk... - Go away. - Listen, I'm sorry… I was angry… I didn't know what to say. You promised. I can try to fix things with Luca if you want... I don't give a shit about Luca! And you know perfectly well what to do to fix things. Look, I really care about you. What the hell do you want from me? Do you want a kiss? Uh? Are you happy now? It doesn't change a fucking thing until you decide to tell the truth! I can't help you. Wait… This is for you…
