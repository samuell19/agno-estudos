- Wait. You have to make a wish first. - I know what she wants. She wants Brad. - Shh. - You don't know what I want. - You don't have to tell us. Just blow out the candles and make a wish. - OK. - Oh my god! - Let me help you with that. What did you wish for, Mary? - I didn't mean this. - Yeah. What did you wish for? Mary? What's going on? Careful, she's still sleeping. Mary? It's OK, we got it. It's just a nightmare, Sweetie. OK? OK. It's just a nightmare. - Every night it's something. This has to stop, Mary. - Jake. It's OK, Sweetie. Let's go inside. Everything's OK now. Honey, I'm just so concerned about you. Mary, you need to take your pills I just don't want you to get hurt. OK? Just get some rest. - Now Robert Edward Lee became the head of the Army of Northern Virginia in 1862. After Johnston would-- Mary? Mary, wake up. - She's losing it. - Mandy. - Well just look at her. I mean she hardly ever changes her clothes or washes her hair. - Mary. Mary, I think you should go see Dr. Campbell. - I'll see you later. - Bye. So you like feeling scared. - Yeah, right. I don't know, there's crazier people in the world, don't you think? - I don't know. Mm this is good. Try this. - Nice typewriter. - I'm surprise you know what that is. So tell me again how it feels when you get really frightened. - OK, well. At first it's like I can't breathe and I want to run away. But then I feel pulled in by my fear. Like I'm totally helpless and I can't move. That's when I get excited. Really excited. - OK. When you say excited, what exactly do you mean? - It's almost sexual, you know? - Really? You get aroused when you get scared? - Yeah. - You've never mentioned that before. - Well I don't tell you everything. - Well maybe you should. - You still renting a video every night? - No, I've seen all those. But there's always something on cable or the net. There's some very nasty stuff out there. - Yeah, I've heard. - I don't know. I guess I just-- I like the feeling of being scared. It's a rush. - Your mother tells me that you're sleep walking again. - That's unacceptable. - Morgan, no pills. No sleeping pills. - Mary, you're a big girl. Nobody's going to make you do anything you don't want to do. But it is unacceptable for you to get up in the middle of night and go wandering around the streets. Now, either you're going to take some pills and get some sleep or your mom's going to lock the door to your room again. You don't want that, do you? - Fine. Fine, I'll take the stupid pills. - Hey. You uh, in for a check-up, huh? - Um, yeah. Just taming the demons, you know? - Sure it's always a good thing. Uh, some of us are going up to the lake after school. Do you want to come with us? - I can't. I'm um-- I'm babysitting. - Hi, Mary. - Hey, Shane. What's up? - Oh. Not a lot. I just um-- Oh I found these uh saltines stickers on the internet. - Great. Thanks. Um. I'll talk to you a bit later, OK? - OK, yeah. - Bye. - Assholes. - There's no way you can read that shit scribble. Are you kidding me? - Stop it. Those are my notes. - Hey, you going to go down later? See you, Jimmy. - Bye. - Take a look at that display. - Hey, Shane. What are you doing? - What is she up to? - Stop it, Mandy. - Sticking up for your boyfriend, Mary? But wait a minute, you don't like boys. I forgot. - Just leave him alone. - You and Shane make a great looking couple. For your first date, I'd suggest a bubble bath. - Not everyone is beautiful, Mandy. - Sticky, bitch. - Just forget about her. - So what's up this weekend? - Brad and Jimmy want to see that movie everyone's talking about. - Cheap horror flick? No thanks. Look at this, The Wisher breaks all kinds of box office records. - Yeah, it's been all over the net. - Recent release of the horror film The Wisher lures audiences from all over the country. - Nothing better to do. - Mary? Mary? - OK. - Excuse me, guys. Guys. Let me through. Get out of the way, let me get through here. - It's OK, guys. He's having a seizure. Just give him a minute and it will pass. Somebody want to go get the nurse, please. - Can't imagine what that must be like. - Yeah, no kidding. - Well if you taught me how to play the game maybe I wouldn't be naked. - Oh I think I taught you very well. - Honey, he taught you. You just never learned. - Yeah, that's what you say. - You better be dealing me a straight flush here, bud. I'm really tired of being the only one fucking naked here. - Yeah well there's no surprise under these pants. Nothing but me and Mr. Horsey. - Yeah, right. - Actually I don't see anything wrong with this. - Because you're enjoying this. - If you think I'm enjoying this-- - You guys where's Brad? - Brad went to get beer out of the car. - He's been gone for a while. - What the fuck was that? - It was Brad. It was just Brad. Who else? - That's not where the car is. - Maybe you should go check it out. He's your friend. - Are you shitting me? - Something's wrong. - Mary what are you doing? Mary, what if it's not Brad? Get back here. - Don't worry, I'll be right back. Brad? - What the hell are you doing? I almost killed you. Mary, wh-- what are you doing out here? Mary? - I'm-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Mary, is that you? Hey. It's almost afternoon, you know. - I'm awake. - Jake, for God's sake, leave her alone. - You OK? Hey, where you going? Out. - Out where? - Look. I'm sorry things are this way between us. But it's going to get better, OK? I promise. - I'm going to see a movie. - I know, I know. OK? I get it. We've been over this before. No scary movies. No horror, no fun, no life. I wish he'd just go away. - You guys, it's in four theaters. It must be making a fortune. - Just make sure we're in the same theater as the guys. - What the hell are these? - Wisher vomit bags? Nice touch. Talk about hype. - Hype is selling a lot of tickets. - Hey, where are the guys? - Perfect timing. - Hey look, there's Brad. - Shh! Quiet. - So what is a Wisher again? - It's right there. As the legend goes there was this woodmen, centuries ago, walking through the forest one day. And he met a nymph. - Yeah, a nymph. - Not that kind of nymph. - A fairy. A female fairy that lives in the forest. Good punchline. - Now, every nymph lives in a tree. And every tree has a spirit called a wisher. Because it grants the nymph wishes. Now the woodsmen figured if he chopped down the tree, he'd become the wisher's new master and he could have all the wishes he desired. And that's what he did. So the wisher had a new master. But something went horribly wrong. - Of course it did. - And then what happened? - Well instead of giving the Woodsmen what he wished for, the Wisher started twisting the wishes around. - Like how? - Well the first thing the Woodsman wished for was to have the largest house in the town. Instead of giving him a big mansion or something, the Wisher we went out and burned all the other houses. Well since no one had a house at all, his was the largest. - Nasty. - So by the time the Woodman figured out what was going on, he nearly had but one choice. He had to kill the Wisher. When he tried, the Wisher turned on him. Killed him. It's all in this poem, you see. A wisher will lay dead until his name is said beneath the tree by powers three. Then it will come to the one it seeks. - Oh, please. - Pretty lame so far. - Nice story. - Let's try it. - Try what? - Calling the Wisher. There's three of us. - Forget it. It's all bullshit. - You got something better to do? - Yeah. You. Isn't that nice? Because he's hot. I can watch him no problem. I knew you'd say that. - Get off the car you little shit. - So here we are. - You go first. - OK. - The Wisher! - The Wisher. - I don't like this. Just say it so we can get the hell out of here. - The Wisher. - Well nothing happened. - So where is it? Where is this Wisher? You see, Ariel? I told you it was bullshit from some crazy old drunk. - Do you know what movie they went to? It was uh The Wisher or something. - The Wisher. Yeah. It's playing up at The Galaxy. - Horror movie, huh? Yeah, I think Kara went to see it with a couple of her friends. - Uh-huh. Mm. - Thanks. Bye. - God, a genie in a tree? I can't believe I'm out here listening to this very fairy tale bullshit! - Leave him alone, Ethan. It was my idea. - I think you should have called him. I really wish I can see you scared shitless. - Yeah. I bet. - Oh my god. Look. - Run for your life! - What was that all about? - I don't know. Today's youth are more violent than ever and it's certainly not safe to go out in the streets anymore. - Mary. What's the matter? - My stomach's killing me. - Is she OK? - No. She threw up or something. - Movie's that bad, huh? - I gotta get out of here. - We'll go with you. - No, no, no. I'll take her. - Yeah. Good idea. - Come on I'm just parked right outside. I'll take you home. - I'm OK. I can walk. What we need to do is take a stand against violence. Now what I want all of you out there in radio land to do right now is give us a call. We need your support. We need your support to take this-- - Um. You feeling better now? - Mhm. - All right. We're going to need this area blocked off. What happened? Man, that is nasty. - Oh my god. That's my Dad's car. - What? - No! No! Mary. You're going to be late for school. - Don't push her back. Tell the teacher. Hi. I'm making your favorite sandwich, peanut butter, pickle, and potato chip. That's Beth's favorite, Mom. - Mary. - Thanks anyway. - Have a good day. Beth's favorite, is it? - Oh, it sure is. - Well you didn't miss much, believe me. - Yeah, still no progress on our petition to study vibrational energy. - You can borrow my notes if you want. - OK. - You better use mine. - Mary, take a look. - Hey. You're back. I, uh, called you. Came by your house a few times. You get my e-mails? - Yeah, thanks. I'll be right back. - I haven't seen her since the movie. - Will we ever live to forget that fucking movie? Just don't talk about it anymore. I didn't see it. Don't bother, it's really bad. Trust me. Looked like. How do those stupid movies make so much money? Hype. Wisher madness. Shut up, Jimmy. - Are you talking about The Wisher again? - Nice going! Shit, I got slimed. Help me. - Look at this mess. - I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. I'm really sorry, Kara. - She is such a bitch. She did it on purpose. It's because of that movie. I hate that fucking movie. I promised him I wouldn't go see anymore scary movies and-- when he found out about us going to see this one he freaked. He was on his way to pick me up when it happened. If I hadn't gone to see it, he'd still be alive. - Mary, it was an accident. What happened to your father had nothing to do with you or the movie. - I'll see you later. - See ya. - Bye. - Hey, um, Kara? I'm really sorry about what happened today. - Just forget about it. This is my mom's anyway. - Bye. Did you hear that? - No. - Probably your neighbor's cat. - Ugliest cat I've ever seen. We'll see you tomorrow, Mary. - Bye. - Thanks for giving me a heart attack. - Mary. Mary. You going to tell me what happened? - I fell. It was an accident, Mom. OK? - OK. Will you just try and eat a little something? - I'm not hungry. - What is it? - I have an English exam in a few days and I haven't studied for it. - You know we're going to the cemetery tomorrow. - We're going to see Dad? - We're going to go see his grave. And I thought maybe we could all go together. - Yeah well like I said, I have this test. So. - You don't want to go see Dad? - You're not going to see Dad, Beth. Dad Is dead. I know that. I wish he was still alive. - Yeah well I wish I didn't have to go to school tomorrow but wishing for something doesn't make it come true. Why would I want to go to the graveyard and think about him rotting in the ground anyway? - That's enough. Just stop it. - Did you hear that? - No. OK, come on, Beth. You can help me with the dishes. You can stack and I'll wash. Hey. - Hey. - Turn on channel 10. - You woke me up to watch TV? - Mary, it's 8:30. - Oh. Tragedy has struck Stanwick High again. A raging fire raged through the building. - What's going on? - Time off for us, that's what's going on. It's not knowing what caused the fire last night at Stanwick High but arson is suspected. Firefighters say high winds fueled the flames. Can you tell me a bit about what happened the other night? - Someone tried burning down the school? - Looks that way. Well whoever did it, did me a favor. Had a stupid chem test today. Shit, check that out. - Did you see that? - Mhm. Fireman's pretty hot. Get it? Hot firemen. - No. No, the guy behind the school. Did you see him? - What guy behind the school? - He looked like-- - Looked like what? - Never mind. I'll-- I'll call you later. - Later. - So who do you think did it? - Well what do your little rocks say? - They say you're spiritually challenged and shallow. Sound about right? - Your purple rocks, astrology charts, and stars don't mean anything in my life. - You know what? That's your problem. Mary, what do you think? Who do you think started the fire? - I don't know. - You guys want to go see a movie or something? - No movies, OK? - What? - What do you think? - OK what is it? - I-- I just thought I saw something. - Saw what? - Nothing. - Come on, tell us. - OK, I know this sounds crazy but I keep seeing that freak from the movie. - What movie? - Which one do you think? - The Wisher. - I thought I saw someone who looked like it on TV this morning and then just now outside. - Listen, Mary. You didn't see anyone. It has nothing to do with that stupid movie. It's because your dad died that same day. You feel responsible for his death. - Look just drop it, Kara. - Yeah, Kara. - It wasn't your fault, it was an accident. - Kara. - An accident, Mary. - Just shut up, OK? - No. I've got something to say. - Well I don't want to hear it. - Listen, Mary, you just gotta- - Just shut up! I just want you to shut up! - Just need to tell you that. Maybe I was wrong but that's just the way I feel. I just care about you, that's all. See you guys later. Shit. - Mary, you want to get out of here? Don't worry about it, just calm down. Check her vitals. - Kara! I need everybody to move away, please. Get them out of here now! Hi, Mary. What's the matter? You look kind of funny. - I'm OK. What are you watching? - I don't know. It's pretty cool. Wanna watch it? - You shouldn't be watching that. Go to bed, Beth. - Mary. You're having a bad dream. It's OK, honey. - What? - Your Dad and I went to the hospital to see Kara. She's gonna pull through. - Well that's great. - Come here, honey. Mary had another bad dream. - I told you not to watch those scary movies, didn't I? - I didn't. - Yes, you did. - I didn't. Liar! - I didn't! I didn't! Don't lie to me. - I-- I didn't. Bizarre. Movie makers manipulate audience using words and images buried within a film. Hm. So I was trying to figure out why the movie made me sick. - Yeah? - There's all kinds of stories about it. You know, people doing weird things. - It's publicity stunts. I mean they put that stuff on the net to try and sell more tickets. It happens all the time. - Brad, think about what's happened in the past few weeks. - It's just coincidence. - In a small town like this? Where nothing ever happens? - Mary, just try to forget about it, OK? - Mary, what's wrong? - Nothing. Nothing. I'll see you later. Morgan. Remember that movie I was telling you about? - Yeah. - I keep seeing him. Everywhere now. - Calm down. Seeing who? - The Wisher. - Listen, someone is following me and whoever it is looks like that thing in the movie. - Mary. This is a fictitious character. - I said someone who looks like it. I'm sure that's who attacked Kara. I saw him watching me right before it happened. - You get a nice sleep last night? - It has nothing to do with that. Look. I know how this sounds. I'm not losing my mind. - Look I'll make you a deal. If you promise me that you take your pills tonight, get a good night's sleep, I promise you we'll go through this tomorrow. Mary? We'll talk this through tomorrow but you've got to promise me. - Fine. - Well she thinks she's being followed by somebody. Yeah. Yeah, somebody who looks like this character in this movie The Wisher. Uh, do you know anything about this? Yes, well Mary has a vivid imagination. Ever since she was a little girl she's monsters, demons, everybody's after her. I'm sure she's just trying to deal with the guild about her father's death. And then Kara, it's a double shock. - Maybe. I'm sure it's going to be OK, Kathy. Thanks, I'll be in touch. - Yeah, sure. The surgery went well. She's uh come a long way but I can't make any promises at this point. Uh, she'll never be the same as she was, you understand. It'll take some time before she can speak again. And even then-- - And? - She's doing better. - So can we go and see her? - She doesn't want to see anyone. - Not even us? - I guess not. - There's something I have to show you. Come on. - OK. - Since the 1960s, the US government has experimented with mind control. The most famous example of this are words and images embedded within a film designed to encourage an audience to buy popcorn and other concession items. - So? Big deal. - That doesn't mean anything to you? - No. Just read this. Who is it? Russ, it's me. Can I come in for a second? Mary, you can't come up here anymore. I got into shit for that last time. - I just need to see something real quick. - Shit. - It's somewhere in the first 15 minutes. The first guy gets attacked by the tree. You know where that is, right? - Yeah. What exactly are you looking for anyway? - I don't know. I just want to have a look. - It's right around here. Go crazy. Watch the fingerprints. Just touch the edges, OK? So uh, you find anything yet? I got a write up in 10 minutes, all right? - Russ? - Yeah? - Have you seen this before? - Seen what? - Have you ever seen anything like this? - Hell no. - Look, here's another one. - That's fucked up. Morgan, I want to talk to you for a second. You all right? - Yeah, for now. Take a look at these. - What is it? They're pictures. - I know that but of what? - I went up into the projection booth of the Galaxy where The Wisher was playing. - I saw it last night. - You went to see it? - Mhm. - Well take a closer look and you'll see what I mean. It's right around the part of the movie where I got sick. See them? All those different symbols? If there's something about this movie that makes people do things then those symbols have got to have something to do with it. - How do you know that? - Well I know how I reacted when I saw the movie at that moment. Maybe someone else was affected by it too. - I think we should keep our meetings to the office from now on. - Why? You're uncomfortable? - Yeah. Gonna hold on to these, OK? - What do you want to do with them? - Well, believe it or not I had another life before I got here. I have some friends that might have some idea about this. - OK. - Mary? - Yeah? - Be careful. - I will. - If he likes me then what's he doing with her? - Poor judgment. All boys have poor judgment and you know that. - Hi, Mary. - Hey Shane. What's up? What's this? - Uh, just some new tunes I downloaded last night. - I wish he could see how ugly she really is. - Who? - Uh, nobody. Um, yeah I have some more stuff I can send you tonight. - Great, yeah. Oh and thanks for all your e-mails by the way. - Great. - He's at it again. - What's going on? - A lot below my waist. - What are you doing? - I'm going. - Are you kidding me? - I just realized the time. Got the swimming pool all to myself for an hour. - Can I ask you something? - Make it quick. - Why do you do this? Brad is one of the nicest guys. And now you're with me? - I'm not with anybody. And you know what they say about nice guys. - I just thought you should know. Hello? Hello? Jimmy. This isn't funny. - What are you doing here? - Just watching you. - Watching. Huh. Hope you enjoyed the show. - You know you're in here all by yourself except for me. Anything could happen. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? Brad, we dated, big deal. - See? Had you scared there for a minute. - You asshole. Brad? Brad! I know you're still in here! All students please calmly exit the building and report to your homeroom teacher. Please do so in an orderly fashion. All students please calmly exit the building and report to your homeroom teacher. - What's going on? - I don't know. - Mandy was attacked with a knife or something in the pool just now. - What? - Hey. What's wrong? Nothing. - Why are you looking at me like that? - No reason. - Are you OK? - Yeah, fine. - You sure? - I just gotta get home. Beth? Beth where are you? Parents are outraged with this second attack on one of Stanwick High's students. The attack of Mandy Newbel has prompted the Principal to close the school until authorities have made further progress in their investigation of the two attacks. Students are asked to stay at home-- - Bethie? What? - I need you to promise me something. What? - No going out alone unless Mom or I are with you. OK? - Yes. I get it. Do you ever think about Dad? - What? Yes. Of course. Why do you say that? - Just wondering. - You miss him? - Yeah. Maybe Dad would still be alive if you hadn't gone to that stupid movie. - Who told you that? Mom? - No. - You know, Bethie, sometimes I just w-- wish. What? What you wishing for? - Where's the phone? - You're scaring me. - Where did you put the phone? What's wrong? What's wrong? - I didn't make a wish, everything is fine. It's OK, it's OK. Come on. Shit. OK. Back here. Hello? Debbie? What is it? - Hide. What's wrong? Look, I need you to come over right now. What is it? Tell me on the phone. - I can't talk now but-- What? Tell me right now. - I think I know who it is. OK, I'm coming right now. - Where are we going? - I'm taking you to the Wilkinson's until Mom gets back. - Come with me. - I'm leaving with Debbie for a while. Stay there until Mom gets back. - OK. - Mary, Mary. Is everything OK? What's going on? - Get back in. - Why? - Just get in! Lock your doors. - Why? - Just do it! - Where are we going? - Drive! So what is it? What are you freaking out about? - It's Brad. - What? - He's the one that's been following me around. It all makes sense. - Mary, you're just being paranoid. He just has a crush on you. - A crush or an obsession? - Look, Mary I've got to get home. You made this sound like it was an emergency. - It is! Listen, right before my dad died, I walked out of the house pissed at him. And I said, I wish he'd go away. I wish he'd just go away. Go away, go away. He was the last one with Mandy before she was attacked. - OK. - And the other night I was having dinner with my Mom and I said, I wish I didn't have to go to school. I didn't have to go to school tomorrow but wishing for something doesn't make it come true, come true. - Then the next day, the library got torched. Brad set the fire so I wouldn't have to go to school. - Mary, you don't really believe this. - You were there when I told Kara I wish she'd shut up. I wish you'd just shut up! - It has nothing to do with that stupid movie. - Look what happened. OK. I'm with Mandy. I said I wish he could see how ugly she is. I wish he could see how ugly she really is. - Then her face got slashed. Brad was the last one to see her, I know. I was with him. And he just followed me home. I was with Beth and I got mad at her and I was about to wish for her to get lost like I always do. And just as I was saying I wish you'd get lost I looked up and I saw him outside the window staring at me. It was definitely him. Like, he was waiting for what I was gonna say and he was ready to do it. - Mary, this is ridiculous. Why would Brad be running around granting you wishes? I want to try something. Try what? Just have an open mind about this, OK? - Debbie, tell me what we're doing. Just come on, it'll take a second. - What are we doing here? - OK. Wish for a winning ticket. - Ugh, God, Debbie. Would you stop it? - Come on. Don't rule anything out. Just wish for a winner and let's see what happens. - It's not going to work. - Just give it a try. Here, pick one of these. - OK, um, fine. How about movie magic? OK. - Make a wish and scratch it off. - Loser. - Well, maybe it wasn't a winner because you didn't say it out loud. - OK. Fine. Watch this. - Watch what? - I wish I had a blue gumball. So much for my special powers. Come on. - Maybe your wishes don't work for good things, only bad things. Wish that I crash the car. - What? - Let's see what happens. - No. - Come on. Try it. - You're making fun of me. - No, I swear, I'm not. Just wish that I crash the car. - This is so stupid. - More stupid than somebody running around dressed as the killer in some cheesy B movie? Look, there's no way Brad or whoever could know what you were wishing for all those times. I mean, you were alone, right? Did it ever occur to you that this is all in your head? - OK. Fine, if it'll make you happy. I wish you'd crash the car! You don't have to total it, just a little fender bender. Maybe I could get some insurance money and fix it up. Why do you think I'm doing all this? I'm just trying to prove to you that this is all in your head. That's all. - OK. Fine. Go! Slow down! - We have to go this fast if we're going to crash the car! - Yeah but you're going to get us killed! - Shut up! - You saw it, right? Say you're sorry. - I'm sorry! Where did he go? - Start the car. How did he know where we were? He's been following us the whole time. Great. That's just great. I don't believe it. Mary, look behind us. The cops. So ladies. What's the hurry? We just hit someone back there. - That's uh, that's quite a story. - It's not a story. Take a look at the windshield. - Look, somebody is following us. - Mary, how many times have we picked you up sleepwalking or stumbling around? You know, there's a lot of kooky things that go on with you, isn't there? We're all really sorry about what happened to your Dad. Really. But I can't help with that. Have a good night. - Fuck. - So much for the cops. What are we going to do now? - OK. If Brad thinks he's The Wisher then maybe there's another way to stop him. - How? - Debbie. - Yeah? - Neither of us saw the end of the movie, right? - Right. - I've got an idea. - What are we doing? - Just come on. Sam! You know the movie The Wisher? - Of course. - Do you know how to download it? - Yeah. - Can you show us? What's going on? Power outage? What happened? - Can you write it down? - There you are. I've been looking all over for you. Why do you keep avoiding me? - I'm not avoiding you. - Mary, you know I like you. All right. I-- I mean I like you a lot. - Mary! Mary, where are you going? Drive! Here's the phone. Call the police. I'll be right back. - OK. Mary, it's from your mom. She's out looking for you. - OK, come on. Did you call? - Yes. - Are they coming? - They said so. - Well did you tell him that he's here at the house? - Of course. What are you doing? - We're going to download the movie. If Brad thinks he's The Wisher then maybe we can stop him like they did in the movie. - Yeah, right. - You got a better idea? We have to find out how the movie ended. What happened to the Wisher? - Well, the Woodman cut down the first tree, another tree rose up in it's place. And the Wisher laid there still. Waiting for a new master to come along. Wait a minute. - What's that supposed to mean? - This is from the beginning of the movie. We need the end. Shit. OK, wait, wait, wait. The Whistler finally figured out what was going on, he knew he had to destroy the Wisher. When he tried, the Wisher turned on him and killed him. - It's frozen. Debbie, look at this. What is it? - OK, just wait. - No, no! Get away! No, no! - That looks like my house. - This is for real? - Which means-- - He's coming here. - No, please! No, no! No! Please, no! No, no! - That looks like you. - He thinks I'm the girl in the movie. It's frozen. - Forget it. Let's get the fuck out of here. - Oh and go where? OK. Wait, wait, wait. - The Wisher. The only way he can stop him is by wishing-- - Ah! By wishing what? Fuck! Look. - Mary. Mary. I just want to talk to you. Mary, what should we do? What's the problem? Mary? - Brad! - Did you lock the door? - Help me with that! - OK, come on. - OK, OK. OK, face my fear. No, it's no good. He saw me! Mary. - Ah! Run! Debbie! - Ow! - Debbie! Ah! Aah! - Mary if he listens to you, say something! - I wish you were dead! - Ow. Ah! - Mary, you OK? - I'm sorry. - Oh, Shane. Shane became obsessed with the movie. He watched it over and over again. 25 times in one weekend. His mother called me, concerned about him. It seemed a simple case of a lonely kid, hiding away from the world in a movie theater. The images that you found embedded in the film? Yeah. - They were actually designed to manipulate the audience. - Is that legal? - You know, nobody knows that much about it. Subliminal messaging, apparently, was abandoned in the '60s. But the people who made this film managed to tap into it. - I guess that means a sequel. - I hope not. - So what happened to Shane? - He's gone away. - For how long? - Wish I knew. - Don't use that word. - Right. I'm sorry. - But you know, Shane is just one person. What about all the others? And where is this going to go next? That's what scares me. - I'll see you around. - Don't worry, you will. - Everything OK? - Uh-huh. Brad? Remember when you said that you liked me? Did you mean as a friend or a friend with benefits? - Well um. What kind of benefits are you talking about? There were signs of forcible entry at the back door.
