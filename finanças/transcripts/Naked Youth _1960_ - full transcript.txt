Sure. - Where are you going? - To Sugamo. I'm going somewhere else. Mako! This one's okay! - Do you often ask for lifts? - Sometimes. Why? There's public transport. This is more fun. Bye. It's not this way. - Fancy a bite? - Alright. HOTEL I'd better go home, it's late. - No, it's not. - Take me home. - Come on, don't be like that. - Bye. Come on! - No! - Come on, please! - No! - Damn you! - Who was your friend? - He was just taking me home. Let's go! - Where? - To the police. You're kidding! What if I hadn't turned up? - Take that. - You fool! BLOODY RIOTS IN SOUTH KOREA On April 19th, a crowd led by university students walked along the main roads in protest. There were clashes with the police during the demonstration. Hi. Why didn't you wait for me? You weren't on time. - Do you smoke? - No. Did you think I smoked? - Aren't you old enough? - What do you mean? Too young to smoke or to seek adventure? I'm not into adventures. Did you only want a lift? Of course. You don't feel like sex, I imagine. Not at all! What about the money? Why do girls try and attract middle-aged men? They're innocent enough at the start... But if that guy had been smarter... - Hi. - Hi. He's a friend of mine, he's joined the movement. Let's go. We have that money to spend. No! Please! I can't swim! - Will you do as I say? - No. Too bad for you. Why don't you want to? So why did you come then? You're curious about men? For sex? I'll satisfy that curiosity. Don't you hate me? You didn't do it because you hate me? At first, I was angry. But not only at you. At who then? Everyone! You asked me why I came. - I didn't want to at first. - Why not? I was embarrassed about last night. I wanted to set things straight. Is it all clear now? We were tired, so we came home. - The rent, please! - You're making us pay! - Do you want us to go? - You don't have to do that. Alright, give us an hour. Lock the door! - You've had enough to drink. - I learnt from you. You'll wet the bed. There's something I want to ask you. Go on. - It won't make you angry? - Go ahead, ask me. Do you like me? Of course. Shall we go? How much is it? You seem very happy. Are you taking your latest catch for a quickie? - I already did that. - You work fast! Are you ready to dump her? Do you need help? There are other ways to get lucky! - When'll I see you? You'll call? - Yes. Call me. It's my friend's number. Her name's Yoko. There's no need for you to take me home. Take your part of the money. - Keep it till next time. - I'll spend it. I'll take you home. My sister. Mr. Fuji took me home. My sister. - Thanks a lot. - Bye. Bye. What happened? You look a mess. - I fell into the water. - How? We hired a motor boat. It was fun. Yoko, didn't anyone call me? No. - It's been almost a week! - What happened between you two? You'd better tell me. Are you going home? I'm staying a bit longer. See you tomorrow. Go away! It's over between us! Sorry. Kiyoshi will be late... But I know where he is. You're lucky. There's a call for you. Guess who it is! You didn't call me. I wanted to leave you. What? Why? For what reason? No special reason. Listen, I'm seeing another woman. A nice girl like you should stay away from guys like me. The night I met you, I'd just dropped her off at her hotel. Let's meet one more time at least! We'd better not. No, you have to see me. You said you liked me! Hello, it's me. I'm sorry. Why did you take her to your room? Anyhow, see you at the bar. Are you worried because she called? Of course. - Do you want to see her? - Yes. But you won't, will you? Why not? - I'm going. - I won't let you go. Who's he? Maybe he's not coming. He'll come. You can't trust men. I can. It's so late, I'd better go home. Are you staying? Wait in your room. I'll take you home. There's no need. - Three's a crowd. - Maybe. Will you be okay on your own? Yes, no problem. Okay, bye. Bye. Miss, where are you going? - Do you want to go dancing? - No. Come on, we know about you. - Play the game. - I can't dance. - But I'll have a drink. - Good. A toast to friendship. It's a pity those two left you on your own. Come on! Knock it down! Drink! Let's dance! What's going on here? Do you want to steal our girl? Sorry. What are you doing? - You're drunk. - Alright, cut it out. It'd cost you a lot to ruin this place. Go outside and sort it out. Alright. Are you with me? I'll be referee. Stop it! That's enough. You're not bad, kid. But stay away from those yobs. You got me? Stop it. - What about you? - We want to continue. Their job is prostituting women and ripping them off. It's a shame they got your girl. It looks like business is slow. How about paying back with money? - Any objection? - No. - No hard feelings? - No. - How much? - Ten thousand yen. - But he's a kid! - Alright, five thousand. I don't have it. Bring it to the bar tomorrow. Alright. Now go. - Aren't you going? - You go first. Why do you do this to me? Tell me! Why has this happened? Why do you do it? You know you don't love me! - Tell me, why? - Stop it! I... love you. That's why I hate doing it like this, if you don't love me! But it happens every time we see each other. So I don't want to see you anymore. You're wrong to think you can treat me like this. I never want to see you again. - I love you. - That's not true. I really do love you! - You're lying! - It's the truth. Are you sure? Are you sure? You lied at the bar the other day. Aren't you telling the truth today? Maybe it's... You can never leave me. Don't even think about it. Do you still love me? Of course. I'd better go home. Home? To get my books and go to school. I'll try and come tonight, but if I don't come, call me at Yoko's house. Don't forget this time. Where have you been? Tell me. I'm sorry. - Where did you sleep? - You'll shout at me, if I tell you. It's never happened before. Thank heavens! You were stricter when I was Mako's age. Now daddy never tells you off. Right? I have to work late. What about you? I'll stay to hear what she has to say. Tell your sister, then she'll tell me. Where are you going? - I'll be late for school. - No! You're going to explain. - Why? - It's that student, isn't it? He's no good! You met him the other day in an unmentionable place. How far has your relationship gone? Tell me. I don't want to. Why should I? I'll miss school, I need to sleep. Mako! Come in. Come home. I'll come soon... not now. Why not? No special reason. It's for your own good. Quit now, before you get hurt. Like you? Yes. You told me you never came home late when you were young. Exactly! Mom and dad were strict. The world wasn't such an open-minded place... And anyway, I had my fun when I was young. You lost... and now you hang around in hotels. That's why you lost. I had real dreams... not empty ones like you! But you lost because you were weak. And are you two sure you won't lose? Are you sure your love story won't finish? Yes. It won't work! The passion will die soon and leave its place to unhappiness. Then it will be too late! She's right. You'd better go home! No, I'm coming to live here. Really? I've just decided. So, from now on, you'll pay your own way. Fine. Goodbye to you both. What about school? - I'm coming. - Bye. - Is that alright? - Yes. I'll get my stuff tomorrow. Can I move in here? Of course. You didn't show up, so we came. - I was on my way. - You're a good kid! Let's have a drink. Lend me your motorbike. - Have you got the money? - I borrowed it. There's no point in paying them. - We can make more money. - How? You go and ask for a lift and I'll follow you. When he comes on to you, I'll show up. It worked last time! - Sounds like fun. - Will you do it? - What if the guy doesn't come on? - That's your problem. If he doesn't, I'll beat him up! That's a deal! Sorry! I must've fallen asleep! Right! And your mouth was wide open. They made me drink six cocktails. - Who? - Those guys. I'll get out here. - Why? - I'm still a bit drunk. I can't go home like this, I'll have a rest. - Where? - At the Jazz bar. - That's no place for you! - It's the only one I know. Alright, I'll take you there. - I didn't want a hotel! - You said you wanted to rest! What are you doing to that poor girl? Do you want to go to the police? I'll take her home. You'll pay for the cab. Miss Makoto Shinjio, Year 3, class B. Looks like you're in trouble. I've heard some bad rumors! Surely not about Mako. I heard about your relationship so I called your sister. She said it wasn't true and I feel relieved. Have you got a boyfriend? I hope you're not too involved in this relationship with him. You'd better not take it seriously. Don't get too serious like your sister here. Her romance kept us in suspense... when we were young! Don't say that! Do you still see Akimoto? Never. In our days, young people were too shy. You didn't even used to hold hands! Give me one. Nowadays, girls even sleep with men! Be careful, it's hard to live the rumors down. Who spoke about me? It doesn't matter. I'm glad you didn't say anything! Two months have gone by. Is everything alright? I envy you, in a certain way. How are things? I'm meeting Yoko, I have to go. Bye. I think taking part in the student demonstrations is stupid. Why don't we think about getting married instead? I thought about it. I envy Mako! They live in such a dingy room but they're so in love! I wouldn't let you live in a dump like this! Are you sure? Why don't you live with me for a while? You made me wait. Good. I'm Yoko, I met him here. I'm Fujii. What's happening? Nothing special. Mako's going to be a bit late. I'm going to buy something. Lady-killer! Have you come to show off your new lover? Don't be like that! Come on! Have some fun! Instead of lecturing me, why don't you think about your future? Not Beethoven! The school fees... - What? - Did you pay them? Yes, all of them! Good! How did you get the money? From her? You get things easily! I went to school just for a change. They told me of the class cutbacks. State schools are easier. They're not very strict there! What would you do if I told her about your ex-lover? That's a cowardly joke! Cowardly? You never know. I could blow the gaff. - Drink. - You think I can't? Don't make him drink too much! I've had more than him. I can drink loads. A nice whisky like this! Mako, your man's bad! Why do you spread those rumors? I never said anything about you. Then how come everyone knows? Maybe somebody saw you with him. And the fact that we live together? If you don't like it, you shouldn't have started. I never asked you to leave home! There's no point getting angry now. Say something! Don't let him take it out on her! Maybe she's not happy. Doesn't Mako look happy? That might be true, but it's not my fault! You're cruel! I'm taking Mako home, she can stay with me! But they live together because they love each other! Are you drunk? I've never been so drunk. Don't walk out on me again! Get up! I'll tell them! What? No! Have a heart! Mako, is Yoko a good friend of yours? Yes, she's my best friend. Do you want to know a really terrible thing? You two look so close... but your boyfriend has another woman. She looks really horrible but she is a woman. She used to come here and sleep with her, in that bed! Mako, is it true? Did you know? What if I had known? You knew! How two-faced of you! Liar! No! Did you get your period? No. Let's go out! - Have you got any money? - We'll make some! In the same way? Don't count on me. Why? I don't know. Come on, be good! What if I refuse? I'm kidding, let's do it? What's wrong? Why are you so quiet? You were rather happy a while ago! You're crying! What's happened? I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. I feel so sad today! Has something bad happened? Nothing serious. Tell me about it, you'll feel better. I can't tell you. Maybe I can help you. Thanks all the same... but I can't tell you. I can't stand next to a beautiful girl like you and watch her cry. I'm sorry! I'll stop. I'll get out here. - Let me out. - Why? I wouldn't sleep if I went home, I'll kill some time somewhere. - Where? - In a tea house. You shouldn't, not on your own. I'll find a friend. That's even worse! I feel awful! I'll get drunk! Wait! Do you want to come with me? Will you listen to my story? You should go home. Let's go someplace you know. No. Let me out here then. You asked me to take you home! I can't leave you in a place like this! Are you angry? No. Do you always drink when you're sad? Sometimes. That's not good. I only drink when I'm happy, so I get even happier. And when you're sad? I don't drink, it'd just make things worse. What do you do then? I go home and cry myself to sleep. You cry? You cry yourself to sleep? When I was young! You see! You feel better already! Thanks. Goodnight. I'll cry myself to sleep. Good. Goodbye. I let this one get away! That's never happened. I wasn't in the mood. What was he like? He was a kind, old man. Much kinder than you were to me today! Get in, come on! This is my house. You forgot? I think I'll stay here tonight. We can sleep alone every now and again. Who is it? It's Makoto. How come you're back? There's no need to say it! Nowadays, young people... You're so understanding! Why weren't you so nice to me? - Times have changed. - That's not true! You never stood up to mom! Times were hard after the war... We thought we had new horizons. We started again as a democratic nation... It was a responsibility that went hand in hand with freedom... But what can I say to this girl today? I don't want to tell her what she shouldn't do. You disappoint me. To think you didn't keep to what you said when you left this house. - Is Mr. Akimoto here? - Come in. Thanks. Hi, Yuki! I was passing by. Come in, have a seat. - Have you got time? - All the time you want. The hustle and bustle will start later. Just patients these days? Yes, we've stopped doing the other things. The voluntary workers left. There's just the clinic left. At least you're still trying to fulfill your dreams. I do wonder sometimes. Akimoto, did you hate me? Did I disappoint you? It's an old story, I've forgotten about it. When we were young we wanted to change society. But we were young, we made many mistakes. Our wall hasn't fallen down. By being impatient we ended up hurting each other. I didn't blame you for choosing an older man! Why are you laughing? I thought I'd sorted myself out, but I hadn't. Doctor, that sick guy... Patient! The patient. What's with the formalities? I thought you were angry. What nonsense! About last night. - I'm not angry. - How come? I understand. Thanks. I think I'm pregnant. Have you seen a doctor? But we can't have a child. Have an abortion. Last night didn't go well, let's try again. You'll feel better. No. Why not? Abortions cost money. What's wrong? You're so cruel! Cruel, me? How could you! It's your baby I'm carrying in my womb. And you still want other men to look at me and desire me. That's terrible! Don't get so angry about it! I thought if I beat up some idiot, you'd feel better. Didn't I already tell you yesterday? I feel like I'm an alien. I don't want to do it, full stop! Alright, calm down. You don't understand. I'm going. See you tomorrow. We'll talk then. Maybe that's better. Will you be at home? Good evening. Do you want a lift? Get in, I'll take you home. Are you hesitant today? You'll tell me to go straight home? No. What was crying yourself to sleep like? It worked. I woke up happier. Good. Tonight I want to drink so I'll feel even happier! Good! The drinks are on me! I don't even know your name! My name's Horio. I'm a hundred times happier! You look tired. A bit. It's late. Do you want to go home? I'll call you a cab. I'm staying a while longer. You can stay. Or you can go... What would you rather do? To be honest, I'd rather you stayed. I'll call my boyfriend and ask him if it's alright. Hello? Is that you, lady? It's me. Can I see you tomorrow? I don't see why I should see you. Why can't you be nicer to me? Be sweet or it will all be over between us. Please, honey. Be sweet. I need a loan. What for? To pay for an abortion. Never. What are you doing? This is for services rendered. You've got a nerve, taking my money to give it to some girl you got pregnant! I can imagine how you reacted when she told you she was in trouble! You wouldn't understand! You don't have a clue. You're wrong! I once aborted a child that was yours! I was sure it was yours. You've never told me. I didn't want to be humiliated by you treating me badly. So I thought I'd be better off sorting it out by myself. But this girl's hopeless. She's not strong like me. Now, you'll just hurt each other. I feel sorry for you. Shut up! Why did you come here? Here. For the doctor. This is the clinic's address. You can go anytime before 8. Go tonight, if you want. Be honest! I'm not the only one to blame! There's no need to worry. I slept with another man last night. Really? Of course. Why did you do it? Why? I don't know, maybe to get over my sadness. You're so cruel. I thought an older man might be kinder. Who is he? His name's Horio. The guy that got away the other night. He was a good man, so kind. But I keep thinking of you. It's irritating, but it's the truth. But I can forget now. I can get rid of the baby. Are you Mr. Horio? Who are you? It's about last night. How about paying for the girl? What relationship do you have? Don't you think you should pay? So you set me up then? Why else would she have gone with you? - The poor girl was crying. - She was pretending. Because of you? Shut up! Will you have a drink with me? I'm hungry, I'd rather go and eat. No, please! Is it you again? Want to have fun with my wife? I should make you pay. You tried to betray me, didn't you? Didn't you know he's no good? You animal! Doctor. Sorry about the time. Come in. - What's going on? - Aren't you busy? I just finished a minor operation. How about a drink for old times? To our youth. I'd love to have it back! What? I've split with my lover. I want to start again. My sister is just like I was. She's rebelling against the world! I want to be like that again! Is there anything I can do? If it can't be love... Maybe a job or something else. You're the only one who can give me a chance. Doctor, that patient... What's going on? Mako had an abortion here. Why are you here? She's an ex-lover of mine. My patients rarely pay me. So I have to do other jobs. She's sleeping. Leave us alone. How cynical! We tried to conquer the world... We were both so determined. What was the result? We couldn't do anything about it. This is a cruel world and it destroyed our love. At least our love remained pure and chaste. We vented our anger with the student demonstrations. But it was all pointless. We got hurt and we split up. We had to accept defeat. Your sister, on the other hand, fights giving in to all her desires. But she won't be able to win. In the end, her failures, like this abortion, will cost her... No, never! The poor girl looked desperate when she arrived. You're wrong! We're not much different from you! I wish that were the case. No! Don't destroy my last hope! Or you'll destroy theirs too. We have no dreams, that's why we'll never be like you! Are you so sure? Of course! I'd better go. There's no rush. We were beaten again tonight. Let's have a drink. We needn't see each other again. Let's spend the night together! Stop being naive! Yuki... this girl... it's like she's my wife. I'm tied to her for the rest of my life! Goodbye. Take care of her. Did you come for me? Did you stay all night? I must be kind occasionally. I don't want you to cheat on me. Stupid. How are you feeling? Still very confused. You'll be fine. Let's go on a trip. Have you got any money? It reminds me of that time on the boat. You were horrible at first. You'd get angry with me for all sorts of reasons. But later, you were very sweet to me. Now you vent your anger on the guys you rip off. I'm going to stop doing it. Why? You don't like it. - Is that why? - Yes. I admit I enjoy the thrill, but it makes me feel evil. I hated being used like that. It's because of those stupid men. Men are always chasing women, aren't they? You'll protect me, won't you? Don't worry. Aren't you angry with me? No. You're so sweet! Fujii? Miss Shinjo? You're both wanted for extortion. I know Mr. Horio... But I don't know him well. But Fujii beat him up and said it was about a set-up. Is that so? There are so many idiots around! Do you admit you were wrong? No! Aren't these guys to be blamed? Who attract girls with their cars and money? I have to admit you're right about that. But someone needs to be in charge. I heard you used force for no reason. You took some money... and spent it having fun. Apart from your theories, the fact is that you like money. Money buys clothes, food and even abortions! Just like your victims, you covet money! You're just like them, you're a victim of money too! You always think about hurting people. Stop denying it! Isn't it time you confessed? One visit. It's you, brother! You idiot! That serves you right! My husband is doing business with Horio. I asked him to put in a good word for you. So act like you're sorry. If you apologize, Horio won't press charges. You just need to say sorry. I'm sorry I didn't look after him. He can stay with me for a while. Thanks. Thanks for telling the whole story! Anyhow, I don't hate you. We're just as guilty as you. One moment! Isn't she with you this time? Get in! Your girlfriend's staying in. She'll go to a reform school. So it's all over then. Why do you keep bothering me? Don't forget that I got you out of there. You admitted you were wrong. That makes a nice change from your usual behavior! I lied to him! Otherwise they wouldn't have let me go. I don't think I was wrong! Where will you go? You should know. Goodbye! - Why don't you let me in? - Let's go. - I can't today. - Why? Where are you going? I'll take you! No way. Is she your ex-lover? She got me out of prison. But I didn't ask her to do it. - What is she to you now? - Nothing! I don't like her. I was ready to start again. She's still following us! Lose her. - Good! - I don't have a cent! Don't you? What a great idea! - What's going on? - They don't have any money! - How much is it? - 360 yen. I'll let you go for today. Call me. What shall we do? I don't know. - Any ideas? - None. What do you think about the set-up we did? I told the policemen I didn't think we were wrong! Mako... forget it. What are you saying? I think it's for the best. Don't get inhibited by an arrest. Remember when you asked me to protect you? I can't protect you. Don't say that. You said that's what women are like. Men are no different. We don't sell ourselves in order to live. That's what the world is like. But together, we... Together or alone, it's the same thing. We just hurt each other. It'll probably be a failure, so why not try by ourselves? No. Even if we get back together again, it won't be the same thing. Goodbye. No! Do you love me? I love you. No! Wait. Why? I was looking for you. You've got us into a real mess. Remember that motorbike? It was stolen! So those two got arrested! You'll sort everything out, obviously. If you don't have cash, how about lending us your girlfriend? I heard you had fun. I won't give her to you! Be careful! What's wrong? Don't you feel well? Where do you live? I'll take you home. How come you're so quiet? Give us the girl. Never! How about we rest here for a while? No, let me out. Let me out! Not yet, kid! NAKED YOUTH
