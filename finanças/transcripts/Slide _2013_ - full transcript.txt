You guys are done for. No amount of money can cover it up. Use your head to think more. We have your information. I don't know the details, but it looks bad. There's no time left at all. At this rate, you're not going to be able to avoid arrest. I'll tell you what. I don't give a shit about your future. You're on your own. But as a friend of mine says, "Kill or be killed." Lebyazhye Village Area of Joint Special Operation of Federal Drug Control Service and Federal Security Service (FSB) My man's been in the house too long. Time to go in. We wait for him to come back. We need the package to arrest them. Are you sure he's even in the house? No movement. Yard is clear. This is taking too long. The traffickers must have received the money. Why did you shoot him? Something's wrong. What if they find out it's a sting operation? If something happens, we'll go in. We didn't hear it, but he might already be shot. Our Father, who art in heaven, He's a narc! hallowed be thy name... Things just got a lot tougher. You may get medals, but my man might die! If we go in when he's at the hideout... he can be shot. Please have mercy... Safron, what do we do now? Kill him. This is sniper 1. All clear in the yard. Time to go. We have to get him out of there. We're gonna need the package. Kill him! thy will be done... What about his life? If I shoot a cop, I'll be arrested. Lord have mercy... There's a car coming from the left. A civilian car is coming in. I can't shoot. Lord, please have mercy... Got a visual on a shooter at the window. What do you want? Lyosha, is he in the kill zone? Target is half-concealed. Is he alive? Check him! Attention to all units. Get ready for assault. So is he breathing or not? Entry team approaching. Now he's dead meat too. Safron! So? Stupid bitch. Open his shirt and listen to his heartbeat. Entry team in position. Safron! He's a cop. Get the door. Move in. Window! Aim for the door. Window. Grenade! Aim for the window. Grenade! Shield! Shield the windows! Protect the girl. Go, go, go. Shoot out the door. Back up. Go back. Go back. Get back. Shoot the window! Stay low. Crouch. Neutralize them. We can't disengage. Destroy the building with GL. Die! Grenade! "Moscow, 30 kilometers." What's your name? Albina. Occupation? I'm a flight attendant. A stewardess? Is this your luggage? Yeah. What's this? I don't know. Let's find out what's inside. Sugar? I don't know. I was asked to deliver it. I see. If you don't cooperate, you're going to jail. Look me in the eye. Who asked you to do this? What the hell are you doing? Where's food? There's nothing? Answer me. I'm gonna put this in the microwave. Had fun till morning? Don't be silly. Wash up first, then go to bed. Just so you know, I was up all night. So you came home in the morning again? Not even bread? Hey. There's none. Clean the bathroom, will you? You're just chatting with a bunch of perverts on the Internet all day long. And have sex too. Whatever you do, don't get pregnant. Don't forget your underwear. I can't find my keys. Where is it? I'm the only one who goes to the hospital. Or am I the only one who wants kids? You promised not to drink for six months. Last time we had a fight, you swore you wouldn't drink. I'm tired. We had an appointment at 8:30 last week, but you came in the afternoon, drunk. I'm not even angry anymore. Just fed up. Good-bye. Bye. Open up. You've got a leak. I'm at the address the woman gave up. Nobody's here. What are you doing there? I'm taking a dump. Max, give me the address. Godvikova, 112. What? Shit! You need to get out of there now. Do you hear? Now. Let's go. Hurry up. What about the bag the woman was carrying? What the hell! Holy shit. We and the FSB raided the compound of our clients. That woman we detained was the ex-girlfriend of the flight engineer who is a courier. He had her carry the package for him. She had the drugs we'd sold. The flight engineer has disappeared. To think we unknowingly seized it. We'll have to get the stuff from Krasnodar. The green car behind us is tailing us. The Lada Niva. I changed lanes three times, but it's still following us. It's not a transporter, right? What do you want? Give my regards to the boss. What do you need? Wait a minute. We're in trouble. We could say we didn't know whose compound it was, but we have to return the goods. Send someone to Krasnodar immediately. It's impossible. We can't find the courier in two days. Wait. You understand, don't you? Give me a break. I'm not gonna do it, man. You know how much this deal is worth? No. I can't do it. If this chick didn't show up, what would've happened to me? I almost died. All right, we'll get someone else. She'll be working in a prison camp, but I'll let her go scot-free. So it's an exchange. We can save ourselves the trouble of finding a courier. If they want their money back, we're in trouble. We've got the goods. They'll call you tonight. They'll tell you the time. If you're asked to come pick something up yourself... That's a setup. Hang up the phone. If everything goes according to plan... Go to the bar on the first floor at the designated time, and kill some time. Meanwhile, my men will put the goods in the room. Don't lose your nerve. The plan is fail-proof. Do exactly as I say. You screw this up, you're gonna get caught. You'll be in prison for the rest of your life. I won't help you anymore. You won't get another chance. Domodedovo Airport Who is it? It's me. You can't sleep, can you? That's right. We have a problem. The FSB checked the Krasnodar flight this morning. They caught the woman with the goods. I don't know what happened after that. It's not public information, but the woman was released after interrogation. You take care of the rest. Thanks for the information. "Old", did you see this ending coming? It's not over yet. "Kill or be killed", that's the only way. It's situations like this that make me worry for my family. It always ends the same way. We're all complicit. Who tipped off the FSB? That woman or one of us. Her? Why do you think they let the woman go? They might have made contact before takeoff. That's okay. I don't think they had time to go into detail. What if she didn't tell them anything? I'm not going to argue with you. I'll pretend I didn't hear that. Even the guys wouldn't listen. Is that what you want? We don't get to choose our means. Children worry about their fathers' ability to provide for them. They don't care how he provides for them. The fate of man is in God's hands. That's what I've learned recently. God gives... us signs But we don't see it. Don't blame yourself. It's not your fault you can't have children. You've already proven that with your ex-wife. Your car's filthy. It can't be helped. You didn't wash it? It's tar. What did you tell the FSB? Tell me what you told them. Calm down. Put your hands down. I'm not gonna hurt you. I won't do anything. Just calm down. What did you tell them? Did you tell them names, the color of the car? The meeting place? What did you tell them? Did you tell them names? What did you tell them? I didn't tell them anything. What did you tell them? What did you say to them? I didn't say anything. Stop! Look. Look there. Where was the flight engineer? I found him on the train to Ukraine. There was a cop in front of his house. He thought he'd get caught. Was it one shot? If you don't tell me the truth, I'm gonna have to do the same for you. Now tell me what you told them! They've never investigated an aircraft before. That woman, or one of us must have tipped them off. Boss. I know it's none of my business, but... Maybe Pepl was the one who tipped them off. He's the one who brought her into our group. So? I don't trust you guys either. You saw him with that FSB guy. I've got FSB friends, too. One of our people tipped them off. Shut up, Ryma. There's no doubt about it. We have a mole on the inside. Think before you make a big accusation like that. What do you think? What? What do you got? Give me a ride. What did the woman say? Nothing. It wasn't her. Who tipped them off? Move to the back. Help me! Stop. Ryma, give me the gun. He's alive. Give me your gun. A car's coming. That's the police. Let's go. That's a police car. Police. We have to take care of this. Let's go. What the hell are you doing? Explain. I thought my arm was broken. Why? How could that happen? Why did you point the gun? He's a traitor. What did he do? You too. What did you think you're doing? Are you out of your mind? He was shooting at us. No. His gun's in the safe. Is this some kind of a conspiracy? I don't like that guy. He let her go. He didn't mean to kill her. Hello? I can't hear you. Why did you run? That's a good question. I'll give the phone back to you soon. Ryma's a bastard. And Max, too. You're doubting me. You're in my way. I'm coming to get you. This is no time for infighting. You're not setting me up, are you? Let me talk to him. You idiot. Answer me. If it's not you... Who betrayed us? We need a law. I'd like to run for the Duma. I want to take the children away from the women after they give birth. So that they can give it to the father. The child will love its father as much as we do. Family breakdown? The media is all over me. I'm more famous than the president now. Igor Andreevich, I'm really sorry about all that. That time... We had a deal. And I know from the news that the deal's not complete. At the time, I had no choice but to join forces with FSB. We got a call half an hour ago. We got the location last minute. I don't care. It's your fault that I've lost my hideout. And the goods I invested so much money in. I didn't know this was your place. I wish you'd told me. Do you want to know where I live? And plans? Where, when, and how much? And... How do you explain Krasnodar, Mr. Narc? I'm not gonna screw this up again. It was a 400,000 dollar job, remember? Sure, that's a lot of money. It's my fault. I guess we understand each other now. Hi. What are you doing here? Nothing. I finally figured it out. I thought I made up my mind a long time ago. I guess we both forgot, the only one thing... The most important thing. Look, I understand your work, I really do. I think we were both wrong. Can we start over? Forgive me. Get the hell out of here. Just go! You're the worst. He's in the house. There's blood on the door. I didn't want to go back. What about your promise to quit drinking? I'll leave the rest to you. Yeah. Just as I was about to leave, he showed up. Thanks for the help. Bye. I'm trying to have a baby. But you don't want it. No. The only thing you're worried about is getting old. Don't touch my stuff. I want my bag back. Give it back! Are you out of your mind? What are you doing? Open it. I'm barefoot. You jerk! Do it without me. I only have a police-issued gun. Polina, I'm coming in. Pick up the phone. I think I know why you didn't just kill her. I want to help you. I owe you. I'll call it off immediately. Let's talk about it. We need to find the traitor. But I know for a fact it wasn't you. What do you say? What is it, boss? Just breathe. Are you okay? Yeah, alive. Where are the children? They're with Andrei. They'll be in Chita for two weeks. That's a long time. There's a branch office there. And the children? They're at his parents' house. Looks like a fun picture. What's going on? It's the same old fight. I'm not going back this time. I've heard that line before. He kicked me out one-sidedly. You look good. You're not drinking? I'll have a drink. Yes? Hello? Who is this? Yulia? Leave me alone. Ribs are intact. They're not broken. There's blood in the tub. He's hurt real bad. And yet he can run. He's probably high on drugs. Boss. You want some? He seems down. I wonder what happened between Boss and Pepl back in the day before we joined. I haven't forgotten about the money. I'll take care of it by tonight. I'll get all the money. Hey, man. Long time no see. How you doing? Yeah, same old, same old. Any word from Pepl? He's got my gun. I haven't seen him. Call me if he shows up. Hey, Andrei. Do you wanna buy an almost brand-new car at a discount? I'm already broke from fixing it. Don't say that. Sorry. Okay. How are you? How much money do we have left? None. What? We can't do this in a day. I saved your life. Do you want to return kindness with ingratitude? Ryma, stop! You'll end up sorry. Isn't that too high a price to pay? It's not like we got drunk and lost it. It can't be helped. It's too high. Even in museums, they give the seller a discount on the price of admission. Pepl's brought trouble. I need money. I can't pay you. There's no credit at all right now. And I'm in dispute with the supplier. Rent me some money. I'll pay you back soon. Do you know what's going on in the prosecutor's office right now? I know. I'll talk to my partner Please. Don't get your hopes up. You can't trust this guy. Come here for a minute. I want you to be my witness. It's our money and yours. Lyokha's gonna help us out, but we're still short. I can't. Do you have a better plan? We'll borrow the slush fund. They're trying to squeeze money out of us and destroy us We can't touch the fund. They know the situation. They don't understand mercy. That's their price. There's no room for negotiation. Then let's just get out of here. We'll split the money. Don't even think about running away. Why not? They're not the police. You don't know it won't work until you try. I'll take my chances. Too risky. Yulia, he's not your meant-to-be. He's just making you suffer. Maybe I'm not a good judge of character, but I still like him. I want to do my best for him, even if it's only for my self-satisfaction. Don't get too deep into him. Take care of yourself. You only live once. What about you? I'm happy. I have a family. And everything was fine for 13 years? Oh, and can I get something for my feet? Are sneakers okay? I'm going to the bathroom. Yulia, wait. Oh, sorry. Hey. Hi. See you later. Listen to me. He's Andrei's friend, right? Hold his arms like this, so he doesn't move. Please don't go in there. This won't take long. Get out. I have a patient. I'll sit here quietly. Get out of here. Are you deaf? I... I just wanted to surprise you. You surprised me. So now please go away. Sergei's coming. You're still with him? Yeah. You and I are divorced. Okay. I don't have any regrets either. Then you'd better get going. Sergei'll see you. Didn't you hear me? If you don't want to talk with me, I'll talk to Sergei. Stop it. Are you trying to cause trouble again? Where are you going? I'm surprised. Did you do this? Hello? The doctor just left with her husband. I think they went home. "Old", why aren't you answering your phone? Lyosha, what do you want? I got a call. There's a patient with a gunshot wound in the emergency room. It could be him. Don't use the bronchodilator. Pick up the phone, please. Yulia? God, women are so stupid. This is the hospital. The test results are in. It's Sasha. I wanted to come by, but... Hey. Excuse me. Tell me about... Hey, someone. Where's the patient with the gunshot wound? Damn it! Who are you? You want to know? Let's go. Right side is clear. All clear. Narcotics Officer. Left is clear. Door on the right. Hey, Ryma. Let's go. I'll take care of the right side. Back up. Nothing unusual. Door on the left. No abnormalities. No abnormalities Proceed. Max. Drop the gun. Get down. Put your hands behind your back. Get down. Stretch out your legs. There's an I.D. on his jacket. Be quiet. Spread your legs. Who are you? Let me see your face. This guy's a cop. He's a cop, too. Take them in. Open the aisle. Stand back. We've arrested the bad guys. Filmed and recorded it. I'll check their car and come back. You know that story about the hearse driver? He started driving a bus. How is that possible? And the old woman... What's that? You know what it is. It was in your car. It's a toy. You've never seen this before? Where'd you get that? The Internet. It happens all the time. You're not hiding drugs in there, are you? Find it out yourself. Any unregistered guns or ammo? What guns? That one. I don't know. Who's it? This is yours. Then why is it in the car? You drove this flight attendant Albina Potashova to the airport, didn't you? It wasn't me. What's this then? You photoshopped it. The morning after the FSB and Federal Drug Control Service agents searched the plane in Moscow, cocaine was found. The day after she was released on bail, she disappeared. This is her ex-boyfriend, a flight engineer. He disappeared the same day as the woman. What does this have to do with us? And before that, during the sting operation, you took her into custody. And seized two kilos of cocaine. Two days later, she's on board. Such a bold plan. Why are you telling me this? You're the one who planned this. I'm going to expose you. That's some patriotic spirit you got there. Comrade Captain, I have an urgent call for you. Tell him to call me back. It's urgent. Thank you. I got it all back. I've been followed all the way. They wanted to catch me in the act. Thank God it was a toy gun I bought it for my kid. I owe you. Bye. Who is it? None of your business. What the hell is going on? I knew it was coming, but I was really shaken. Fortunately, we're out of trouble. We're running out of time. We have to do something. That's the house. Are you sure? I think it's the entrance. Maybe. I'm not sure, but boss seems taken by Pepl. A long time ago, when the boss was shot in the leg... Pepl carried him away. They were hiding in a hole with a dead body until help arrived the next morning. Narcotics officer. Open it. What's the room number? I don't know. What day is it today? Why are you here? It's not visiting day. What are you... Max. Max, he's here. Wait. Stop. Wait. Wait, dammnit! Stop! You're in my way. Get out of the way! Damn it. Damn it. Shit! Does Andrei know about Roman? No. He doesn't know I'm having an affair. I don't pry into his matters either. It's working. We're fine. Really. I don't understand. I love my husband. I love my children. We have great sex. Everything is good. No, I don't think I can do that. It's not that I'm trying to be faithful, but... I want to know everything about my partner. I don't want to know only partially, you know. For love? Hi. Already in Moscow? Okay. Who? No one. I'm not sure. I don't know. I can't talk right now. Call me back. What were you talking about? Nothing. What is it? Lyosha, where are you? Max got shot while you were gone. By Pepl. What? He shot him in the public. There were a lot of witnesses. He took the car and fled the scene. What's the license plate number of the car? I couldn't see. There's blood everywhere. I don't know if the bullet went through. Check it out. If they find the bullet, they'll know whose gun it is. Are you okay? He knew we were going to the kid's place, so he came. He even asked his ex-wife for help. What a guy. That's because you got lost at the entrance. Look who's talking! You missed your shot. And he was right in front of you. Well, that was a nice drive today. Dad... I'll get the job done. On Wednesday and Saturday, let's go to the zoo. You've never been, right? I'm screwed. Almost there. Stay with me. You're gonna be okay. Sergei. What do you got? The vehicle we're looking for was spotted on the outskirts of town. He's heading down the highway. Have you settled in? Okay, let's go. All there's left is two doses of painkillers. He could die. We need to rethink our plan quickly. Are you listening to me? Almost there. Get the car... You hear me? Call a doctor. Stay with me. Don't faint. Look at me. Don't give up. Open your eyes. Apparently, God doesn't forgive everyone. Stay with me. Look at me. It's too late. Open your eyes! I knew it all along. I begged God for my life. God sent a woman. But I messed it up. Everything. I'd always thought about myself. Only myself. That's a heavier wound than I thought. Did you get what I asked for? I brought the drugs. You're not coming, are you? Hello? Did you change the number? The incident wasn't in the store, was it? Four civilians were shot. Two of them died before they could be transported. This is your problem. Don't drag me into it. He's got the evidence, huh? Krasnodar's goods? You make me laugh. What's with the flight attendant girl? Where'd she go? I promised not to arrest you if you gave me the information, but it's not free. I'm a cheaply paid FSB employee. If I don't have the money by the end of the night, you'll be under arrest by the morning. You're not having much luck either. If you mess up again... your escape route will be smothered in seconds. If we don't take care of this... It's over. It's the 6:40 am flight. I'll join you after I finish some business. If you're going on a trip, you should talk to me first. It was cheap. We can't travel unless I do this. The kids are sick. What are you talking about? They haven't been feeling well for weeks. Are you listening to me? We're going to a warm country. They'll feel better. Put on your shoes. Hurry up and put on your shoes. It's hot. If they had a fever-- You're on your own, ok? Come. Hold still. Alisa. Alisa? Playing ball? She's playing and making a mess again. She needs to change. It'll take 30 minutes. Please don't yell at me. What the hell! What the hell are you doing? You scared the hell out of me. You too. I was just cleaning up Alisa's ball. Hello? Max is okay. A ricocheted bullet must've hit him. The wound is small. Bullet's out. Internal organs are fine. He got lucky. But the white coats took a lot of money from me. That's about it. Where are you? I'm busy right now. I'm asking where you are. Let's take the money and get the hell out of here. The slush fund? Give the money back to Igor Andreevich or he'll kill you. We'll split the money. We had a deal. Answer me, where are you? I'll call you back. What the hell? You've got to be kidding me. Hey! Hey, boss. Hey! Did Igor Andreevich just ask for a lot of money? Instead of the goods? So you're going to get your hands on the slush fund? Who the hell are you giving the money to? You're not dealing with Igor, are you? You just made a deal with someone from FSB. How much did it cost you to avoid arrest? What the hell are you talking about? Listen to me. Wait. Calm down. I let you go. Why didn't you just go home? You think I'm gonna mess with your kid? I was just checking the house. Alisa. Don't come. Come here. You gotta clean up. You want to go to church? Here, let's get the ball. What are you doing? It's just a ball. Let's take the clean one. Don't do it. I'm just gonna take it. It's just a ball. There you go. It's just a ball. The cleaner the ball, the better, right? Right? Thank you. You don't like flowers? I told you, I'm allergic to them, Vadim. Are you contacting me because you're still in love with me? You're wrong. I heard you the other day. You were married. But... If only you were willing to... But you... you didn't mean it. I was married too. Pepl's here. Yeah. Let's split up. I'll kill him. There's no time. Go get the money. Where are you? Give me a location. Where's Vadim? He's waiting in the car. Are you going with him? You're not in a relationship. He's single now. I'm single too... Are you starting a new life with him? No, he's taking me to my mother's. I need to sort out my feelings before I hurt anyone. Hello? Who is this? Hey, Vadim. I'm going back. Yulia! Yulia! I told you she's not here. She's with Vadim. Vadim? Give me an address. No. Answer me. He's an old friend of Yulia's. Leave her alone. It's for her sake. You don't know the address, don't you? About the plane... The investigation is no accident. We have a mole leaking information to the FSB. It's one of you. I'm pretty sure of it too. But the FSB can't seem to get around to arresting you either. Or maybe this could be the informant's plan. What do we do? I'm not taking any chances. Our business together's over. The debt is canceled. You and I... We won't see each other anymore. How dare you ask for such an outrageous amount of money? Get back in the car. Who the hell are you? Shut up. Let's go. How dare you talk to him like that? You've got to be kidding me. Hello? It's me. That's my man. Yeah, he's one of us. What did you say? Where? What's the status? I got it. What's up? Lyosha's been shot. Really? There must be a mistake. Lyosha's dead. Who did this? It's got to be Peppl. There's no one else. Lyosha was chasing him. This is the worst day ever. Pick up the phone. God help me. Please pick up the phone. What an idiot I am! Pick up the phone. That's not mine. Hello? Hello. Yulia. Who is this? Pepl forgot his phone. It's been a while. How are you? There was blood all over the tub. Did he get hurt? He'll be fine. But there's a problem. Let's meet and talk. Hello? I can't hear you. Yulia, it's me. Hello? I'm in the metro. It's me. Please don't hang up. I can't hear you very well. Where are you? Is that you? Are you okay? Where are you headed? Kolomenskaya Station. What did you say? Your people... Who? I can't hear you. Hello? Please forgive my stupidity. I love you. Thank God you're okay. I was so scared. Are you okay? What's going on? Your people... What people? As promised... I'll meet you there. I've got the money. Hey. There's more cash. Who's adding to it? Pepl, I think. What are you going to do, run away? Is there a problem? - No What did I do? What's going on? Get back in the car. Tell me. Get back in the car, please. Calm down. I'm a police officer. I need to see your license and car registration. Here it is. Take the money. Give it to Igor's men. I'll contact them. This is a stolen car. There must be a mistake. You're still alive. But thanks to you, I have the money. You're lucky. Where do you think I got the money? I don't know, but it will save my ass. You think I've been saving up? If you want to talk, I'll take my time listening to you in the woods. You're gonna be okay. Everything okay? Almost there. So where's the money coming from? You son of a bitch. Look out! Fire! Right. Fire. Die! He fired four shots. Seven shots. Eight shots. Kill. Grenade! Come on! I've got some new mags left. Come out, you coward. I'm gonna kill you. Bring it on! I've... still got mags. Come on, let's go. It's over. What's wrong? Wake up. It's over. Hey, Yulia, what's wrong? Still no luck? Apparently, this car was flagged as "stolen". I must have screwed up when I registered it. Where's Ryma? No word? He's not answering his phone. No answer from the business partner, either What's going on? Just go. FSB? Who the hell are these guys? They're not Igor Andreevich's men. He's from a completely different organization. Or maybe it's not Igor Andreevich we're dealing with. Anyway, I think I'll take the money. My wife will be happy. We're in big trouble. Pepl's escaped with all the money. Bastard hit me over the head as hard as he could, almost got my skull caved in. Do you want to be killed? Where's the money? Pepl took it and ran off with it. Take it easy. I'll admit I screwed up. But there's still a lot of money left over, right? Let's make some more money. We pissed them off. We're overdue. It's too late. Boss is right. They'll never forgive. And there's not much money left. Pepl would have run somewhere far away. That's all the money we have right now. Let's split the money and get out of here. But only the boss knows where it's hidden. Divide it into three equal parts. It's easier to divide by two. I don't give a shit about your future. As a friend of mine says, "Kill or be killed." It's me. Pepl's run with all the money. This is the money I was supposed to give you. It's been taken. You've been talking to Igor Andreevich? He's not from the FSB, is he? All you can think of is FSB? I'm sick of ex-KGB guys. Did you get hit in the head and go crazy? Hello? How are you? What kind of information? I don't need you anymore. Deal? That was a year ago. You're taking too long, Peppl. The FSB is monitoring us. All right, where do we meet? Tell me where. Pulse is weak. What are you going to do? We'll wait to hear from Pepl. What about the money? Why the change of plans? Relax. Why? 7, 8... Fine. You're too cocky to your elder. What elder? Think about what you're saying. Sit down and shut up. Let's not argue. Let's go get the money. You hear me? Listen to what I'm saying. Hey. Turn around. Hey! Don't ignore me. Listen to me! What the hell? Don't touch me. What did you tell them? This is the last time I ask. What did you say? What did you tell them? Answer me. The baby... I'm pregnant. And? So useless. What? I'm busy, I can't talk. I understand. I'll call you back. Tell him to put it back. I don't know what color it is. I can't talk right now. I'm meeting someone.

Keep calling them. Sorry. Max, how do you want to finish this? The throat, or the temple? Max. Hey. I've sent three of my men. Have you heard from them? All three of them aren't answering their phones. Okay. Let me know if you hear from them. Die. Ryma! What the hell are you doing? I told you to do it when I'm not here. That's not what you said. Damn it... Where's my husband? He's not here. He's not? He left. Where to? Why won't you tell me? You've been saved. You should be resting. You were bleeding pretty badly, but you survived. You were lucky. Both of you. I have to call him. Where's my phone? Don't push yourself. You need to rest. You have to think about the child. I need to talk to my husband. Give me back my phone.
