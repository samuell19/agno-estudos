Get us a couple of drinks, will ya? Excuse me. Hi. Hi. Did I just hear yousay that you're an actor? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I am. - I'm Elise. Hey. I am casting a feature film right now, and I think you'd be absolutelyperfect for one of the leads. Really? Here's my card. Call me tomorrow, and we'll workout a time for you to come in. All right. Who's your agent? My agent? You do have an agent, right? I'm not your agent. No, man. Come on. What do best friends do for each other? Anything. - You're serious. - Yeah. Yeah, I'm serious. Come on, it's Hollywood. We'll cross the detailsbridge when we get to it, OK? Hey, hey. Here he is. I thought he was here somewhere. Fantastic. I'm Elise. And you are? - How are you doing? I'm Todd. Todd Doherty. Yeah. Oh, I represent Ryan here. What, uh-- what can we do for you? Wilshire Place Management. How can I help you? Oh, Ryan. That's great. That's great. Todd. I'll see you. Good news and bad news. "Journey of Flight 107" bombed. Like, bombed. I'm well aware. Let me trade you. Happy birthday to the girlwho saves my butt each day. Oh, my god. You didn't have to do that. Oh, the guy in the corner had socks. You want me to take them back?- Ooh, tube socks? Do you believe that? More bad news. He's on the front cover ofthe "Onsite Reporter" again. And the talk sheet. Nice work, buddy. More bad news. Ed's face is a particularlyintense shade of bright red this morning. And he wants to see you. Great. Let's avoid that. And, uh, why don't youtell me the good news, huh? Um, yeah, not so much. Hi. Ed, here, let me get that for you. There's a new intern tour about to pass through here any minute. You, uh-- would you like meto, you know, close the door and just tell them that you're gone? Psst. Ch, ch, ch. Ryan. You look very nice today. - Well, thank you, Ryan. - Have a good night? - Yeah, I did. - Yeah? Gloria. Hi, Steph. Hey, Rob, can I get that fax? Got Mitzi Miller from Product. Mitzi, you're on with Todd. Hey, Mitzi. Hello, darling. You're going to have to find someone else to dress Ryan for the Globes. We're bowing out. - Whoa, Mitzi. Wait a second. Lewis Lancaster, "Vanity Fair." Hey, Todd. We were wondering what you thought about having Ryan in a feature article about the rise and fall of a superstar. David Perlman, Touchstone. Todd.Sorry. Change of plans. We're taking him off the Julia Roberts picture. First of all-- My office. Now. There's no excuse. Ryan Banks went from A listto B list in less than a year. You had every teenage girl inAmerica ditching school to see his movies over and over again. You had multi-million dollar offers from every studio in town. You had the world in the palm of his hand. And you reaped the rewards, Ed. Look how much money he's made this company. It's not about money. It's about image. We represent stars on theway up, not on the way out. Ed, he's my best friend. I'm not going to let you do this to him. Oh, he did it to himself. Did you see his latest pile of crap? Ed, that movie bombed becauseit sucked, not because of Ryan. You're a good manager, Todd. You've guided Ryan'scareer from the beginning. You've produced almost all of his movies, and you made him a star. But lately, his stock is dropping. And I don't see my company growing with this kind of client, or you holding me back. What's that supposed to mean? Todd, unlike any other manager here, I let you focus almost solely on Ryan. If I let him go, then itmakes sense to let you go too. Ed, Ryan's kind of celebrity doesn't just go away. America had a place in their heart for him. It's just a matter of carving that out again. I know I can do that. You've got three months. I see you in Runyon Canyon all the time. Oh, you're the one with the retriever. Yeah, I always wanted to say hi. Well, now we meet. Hey,. Good to see you. Hi. Hey, dude. - Hey. What's going on? Not much, not much. You're-- you're Ryan Banks. Yeah. I love your films. Thanks. And you are? Ronnie. Ronnie. Hi, Ronnie. What are you drinking? Cranberry vodka. The movie was terrible. I know. It wasn't your fault. I'm justsaying that your reputation with the ladies-- - I'm a dog. Yeah. Hey, I am no different thanany other normal single guy. How about yes, you are. According to nine magazines thatare on the stands right now, you're one of the mostfamous single men in America. But look, that's part of the job-- the public's interest in your life. So I'm supposed to be a monk? No. But the public has to love you again. And if you're serious abouthaving the kind of career that we've always aimed for, something's got to change. Because right now, thetabloids have it out for you. Tomorrow's newspaper, you'll be gay. At least I still have the Julia Roberts movie. You lost the Julia Roberts movie. What happened? I'll fix it. I promise. We got to focus on the image thing. You can't cheat. You can't break up with other women without letting them know it. And you can't.- No, no. That's just the tabloids exaggerating. I know. I know. But you can't give themas much fodder as you do. I'm sorry. So Leslie, there's a few reality show ideas we think you'll love. Bring them on. First one-- "Under Shelter." 25 homeless people livingtogether in a real shelter. Each week, they compete in various obstacles-- who can eat the most soup in 10 minutes, who can make the best outfit outof raggedy clothing, et cetera. Each week, someone is kickedback out onto the street. But the last remaining homelessperson wins a million dollars and is therefore no longer homeless. I love it. Sold. What else? School bully. We go into a middle school andtake out the five meanest kids and pit them against one another. They get 10 points for detention, 20 points for making somebody cry, 40 points for mouthing off to a teacher. Bully with the most pointswins the school bully crown. But what they don't realize isthat this gets them suspended from school permanently. So in the end, this reallyteaches a valuable lesson. Brilliant. Sold. What else? OK, it's "TemptationIsland" meets "Survivor." 10 engaged couples on a cruise ship, and you get points for cheating. The couple with the lowest points each week gets kicked off. And here's the twist. I'm bored. But you're on the right trackwith the romantic slant. What else? It's called "The Vegetable." Eight families, each with afamily member on life support. Now-- Yo! - Yo! I got breakfast. Thanks. Have you thought any moreabout our talk last night? Not really. Like, I don't know, maybesettling down for a while? Show me awoman to settle down with. 'Cause I never met her. How about I show you 15? 15? Yeah. That's a good start. It's called "I Want to Marry Ryan Banks." It's your own reality show. America will pick your potential wife for you. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What? Think about it. Think about it. For six weeks, you'll havewomen around you at all times. This makes you very happy. They're competing for your love. They're throwing themselves at you. It's a win-win. The catch is America voteseach week for the girl they like the best. It's the ultimate fantasy fulfillment. Normal girl marries big celebrity. And we're going to depict you as the man that everybody wants to see-- the sweet, sensitive, romantic guy, the guy of every girl's dreams. And in the end, you get the perfect girl. It can't go wrong. That's ridiculous. Of course it's ridiculous. Look at the state of television. What isn't ridiculous? The tabloids say you're a dog. You say, yeah, I am a dog. Here's what I'm going to do to change that. I'm going to date 15 women at one time. Do I really have to marry the final girl? No, of course not. Who knows? Maybe you'll find somebody you like. Do I get to pick the women? No, you can't pick the women because you got to be all excited. - Screw that. OK, we'll see what we can do. OK. All right, let's do it. What's next? Sell it to a network. And that's not going to be a problem. I love it. This is just the thing for sweeps. So here's what I'm thinking. Each week on Tuesday night, we'll broadcast an edited version of the week's most dramatic footage. Then viewers have a couplehours to call in and vote. On the next night, we boot thebitches with the least votes. That's original. Please, I haven't had an original thought in my life, which brings me to my next idea. We should get AT&T Wirelessto sponsor the whole thing. Viewers can text in their votes. We'll do signage, product placement. The show won't cost us a dime. So let's go find some women. You read my mind. Ryan is searching for a wife. If you want to marry Ryan Banks, click here. - Did you see our website?- Yeah. Yeah. You got me Lakers season tickets? Lakers season tickets? I thought you'd like those. You didn't have to do that. It made be happy to do that. Congrats on getting our show picked up. Well, congrats on havingevery woman in America want to be your wife, including the ones that are already married. Insane, right? Yeah. Shall we? Yes, let's shall. And honestly, Ryan, I've always felt something really intense when I watch your movies. Oh, god. Mm. We really have a connection. And I think that's somethingthat's worth checking out and checking me out. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes? Oh, yes. Do you not understand the point of this show? We need variety. And you need to see me not be into her. I'll get respect for dissingthe girl with the biggest rack. That's a good point. Mm. OK. I've seen all your movies. I also play the ukulele. These are real. Hi, Ryan.- What? La, la, la, la, la, la, la. Is it on? Yes, it's on, Trish. OK, are you sure? Yeah? OK, OK. Hi. Hi, I'm Trish from Boston. And this is my husband, Patrick. And I know what you're thinking-- three way. No. I mean, not that I would mind, Ryan. But-- Trish. Sorry. Come on. We're actually making thisvideo for my sister, Charlie, who would never in a million years submit herself for something like this. Huh. She'd be too embarrassed. Charlie works in this littlebookstore in Cambridge. She's a smarty. She went to an Ivy Leagueschool and graduated at the top of her class. Patrick, get closer. She has no idea we're stalking her. Look at that body, huh? Hot mama. Over there. Over there. This is the bar Patrick and I own in Southeast. Oh, and there's Charlie withsome of her biggest fans. Oh, they're all in love with her. But she's picky. She is your girl. Now, I would submit myself. But I'm already married, andI'm probably not your type. Look, I know Ryan gets a lotof flack in the tabloids. But I know the tabloids lie. My sister Charlie-- shedeserves a Prince Charming. And we hope that Prince Charming is Ryan. She's perfect. Absolutely perfect. So you're lookingto settle down with a woman? That's right. Well, that could really only mean one thing-- you want me. Ellen, you're already taken. Oh, yes. I know. But I think we both realize Iwould leave my husband for you. But seriously, you are going to be living in a mansion with 15 women? That's right. What a slut. I've been called worse many times before. But you know, I really want to find someone. I'm from Boston. I grew up like everyone else. And I feel like the reasonI haven't fallen in love with anyone is because I justdon't meet enough women that are normal and real. Well, we could put your number right up on the screen. And I promise you my viewers would give you enough normal and real dates to last for your entire life. But seriously, you are goingto be selecting 30 finalists-- Yeah. That you're going to be flying to Hollywood-- For interviews. Mm-hmm. And then you're going tobe choosing the final 15. That's right. Well, I tell you what, Ryan. Why don't we call one of those finalists and let her know that she has made the cut? Really? Absolutely. Charlie Norton from Boston. No way. That's great. No one ever said the man couldn't act. She should be in hersister's bar right about now. Oh, my god. They're calling. Oh. Hello? - Hi. Is this Charlie? Oh, my god. I'm on national television. Hi, Ellen. Hi, Ryan. - Hi there. - Ah! Oh, my god, I'm gonna die.I'm gonna die. My nerves are gonna die. I hope she does that every time she sees you. Yeah, right. Charlie! Phone for you! Hey, thanks. Hi, this is Charlie. Hi, Charlie? This is Ryan Banks. Yeah, very funny. Who is this? It's me. I'm calling you from the"Ellen Carter Live Show." Is this a joke? No, it isn't. I know this is a joke. No, really. It's me. This isn't a joke? Charlie, have you heardanything about the new TV show I'm doing? Uh, the-- the-- the who wantsto date you and marry you show, or something? Right. Well, your sister sent ina videotape on your behalf. And our producers chose youas one of our finalists. So we want to fly you to LosAngeles and interview you. How does that sound? Oh. This is-- this is crazy. I-- I can't-- - I'll be there. - No. What are you doing? No! No! - Great, great. Well, I hope to see you in the house. What are you-- I can't do this! You have to do this, Charlie. Come on, how many nightshave you complained that you haven't met the right guy, huh? Yeah, but I don't want to meet him on TV. It's a sign of the times. And hello, it is Ryan Banks. Trish-- He's hot, Charlie. Come on. I am going to kill you, kill you. And you, you. Oh, hey, did we rememberto order the roses for the girls' hotel rooms? Two dozen each. And I had an idea. That would make it nice tohave a note attached from Ryan. Brilliant. Who hired you? - You did. I'm good. You do Ryan's autograph, right? Oh, yeah. We're with the "I Wantto Marry Ryan Banks Show." Trish-- Look at this. Who are they from? "Dear Charlie, I hope yourroom is to your satisfaction. Welcome to Los Angeles. And good luck in your interview tomorrow. I sincerely hope we meet soon. Ryan Banks." He wrote a letter to you personally, and you now have his autograph. Have you died and gone to heaven? He has really nice handwriting. Oh, yeah. Oh. We're insane. This is insane. Would you have a little fun, Char? This is not life or death. You are so serious about everything. I am not. I'm looking for someone who can give me the lifestyle I deserve. And you think you have what Ryan's looking for? I know I have what Ryan's looking for. I mean, hello. What are you into? Uh, what are you-- what are you into? Like what, hobbies? Sexually? Sexually. Uh-- sexual hobbies-- hobbies-- hobbies. I like sailing, tennis, shopping, picnics. I'm really into wine. Mm.

So do I. It's, uh, nice meeting you. Yeah. Yeah. Are-- are you kidding me with these questions? I mean, come on. What turns you on? I'm just not that into it. What, are you crazy? It was really a nice try. But this whole thing is just a little bit weird. Oh, Charlie. Well, why don't we just bail out and go to a museum or something? For heaven's sake. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to run into you like that. Don't worry about it. It's cool. Wait a minute. Are you sure you're OK? Uh-huh. You must be fine. - I'm Ryan. - I know. Hi. Yeah, Charlie. Hi. Hi, I'm Trish.

Maybe someone will noticeyou from the show, you know? So I was flipping through the contract, and I noticed that they can't put any cameras or mikes in the bathrooms because of some new privacy laws. Oh. If we ever need totalk without being heard, then just come in here. Thanks for the tip. So yeah, that's, um-- that's my plan-- get noticed, get famous. I already have a boyfriend, but he's in on it. So don't tell anyone. OK. But I had to tell youbecause you're going to hear me in here talking to him on this. Oh. We're not allowed to talk onthe phone, so I snuck it in. You can use it whenever you want. You know, we have to-- we have to stick together and help each other. That's the only way peoplewin on these things, by forming alliances. OK. So what are you going to do if you win? I date Ryan long enough to get really famous and then break up with him. Just like anyone TomCruise has ever been with. I think-- I think you have a reallygood chance of winning. I mean, you are that girl. Oh, what girl? The one that everybody is going to fall in love with, including him. Oh. No. I-- I don't think so. I've never been great atlong lasting relationships. You're just picky.

Who is that? It's my roommate, Lauren, who I love. Well, lie. This is a competition. I'm not lying. I like her. You are never going to win with this attitude. Hey, pull that down on the main monitor. Trim the tail, and that'll be much better. You guys, have a look at this. Who is it. I can't tell. She's not allowed to hide her face like that. Wasn't there a rule against this? Yeah, I just created it. You go tell her to removethe hoodie, then stall her. Sure. Go find Ryan and tellhim to get to the kitchen. This could be a great little scene. Hey there. Ha, ha. You scared me. Sorry. It's OK. I was just sent down hereto tell you that you can't cover your face like that. I did it on purpose. I, uh-- I wanted to avoid aconfrontation about the fact that I was about to force theentire contents of the kitchen into my face. What are you concocting? Oh, no. I don't give away my secrets. Anyway, uh, you have to participate, which means we can't have you hiding your face from the cameras. Right. Are you getting rid of me? No. No. No, I'm just telling you whatI'm supposed to tell you. To tell you the truth, um. I'm just used to it being quieter in my little book store. Favorite book? Oh, "Breakfast at Tiffany's." Oh, great movie. I never saw it. You should. You should read the book. I have. Oh. I should go. Oh. You know what? Here. Here. You must be hungry. That's yours, though. No, I can make another one It's OK. Hi. Oh, hi. Hi. I'll take it for the road. OK. So, uh, what are you doing up so late? Um, I was just making myself something to eat. Can't sleep? Well, not that tired, I guess. You know, from the moment we met, I knew that we were goingto share something special. Really? Yeah. How? Because, um-- because you're so beautiful. That's nice. Thank you. He clicks with all the other girls. I don't get it. She's too much for him. He doesn't know how to handle girls like this. Well, he's going to have to learn. So, um, what do you think, you know, of all this craziness? Having all these ca-- cam-- cameras and girls flocking to you? I don't know. I guess I'm just used to it. It's really got a pimento in them. Oh, yeah? Yeah. I don't really like olives. Oh, it's cool. Pickle? Super bright like candy apple red-- OK, all set? Let's do this. Slate. Got it. Thanks, buddy. Am I good? OK. So what do you think of Fran? Which one was Fran? Show him. Hi. Oh, yeah. What's with that? Why did you guys cast her? Because she's tragic. And if you show interest in her, it shows heart. Oh. I think Fran has somethingreally wonderful to offer. Moving on to Dana. Hi. Hi. Wow. Dana, Dana, Dana. Ha, ha, ha. Every time I look at Dana, Ithink, oh, baby, come over here and sit on daddy's lap. Take two, please. Dana is a wonderful woman. She's beautiful, and she's not afraid to let you know that she's in charge. Good. Now, what about Charlie? Charlie-- uh, Charlie's a tough one. I mean, when I was in the kitchen with her, I had no idea what to say. Well, that's because she doesn't take the Ryan Banks bait. America is going to vote for her. So you're going to have tostart charming her, sweetheart. Todd's way better withgirls like that than I am. So he'll help you with what to say to her. Sound like a plan? I'll do my best.

Brush that hair out of her face. Now say good night and apologize for cornering her with all the cameras. I'm going to, uh-- I'm going to say good night now.

She said, oh-- you. God, you're a pro. - No, no. No. No, you're the pro, man. You saved me with her. You know, it was like we were doing a scene-- Ryan. --But you were feeding me my dialogue. Ryan! I felt like Marlon Brando in that movie-- - Ryan. - What? She's the one. You keep making it work with her, and your image will bethe perfect boy next door. Nice. Do you dig her? - Yeah, I dig a lot of them.- Yeah. Come on. Let's get to the hot tub. I love my life. Please, ladies. Ladies, who wants another cocktail? I do. I do. This is nice. Oh, hey,. Ryan, get back in here. Ryan, Charlie just came downthe stairs right behind you. Oh, hey, guys. Um, I'll be right back. Where's he going? Who is he, Ray Charles? He is into everybody but me. Sawyou girls sitting over here, and I couldn't resist. Hey, Ryan. Well, thank you. OK, space blank. Five letters. Huh? The crossword puzzle. Space blank. You're asking the wrong guy. Oh, it's cadet. Space cadet. Uh, wait. Um, cadet. Space blank, five letters. - Space cadet. - Yeah. Thank you. Hmm. Ah. Ask her to take a walk. Uh, Charlie, would you like to take a walk? Yeah, I'd love to. Excuse us, ladies. Sure. So do you miss home? So do you miss home? Yeah. Yeah. My sister, especially. Hmm. OK, be interested in her. What's, um-- what's she like, your sister? Oh. Well, she's obsessed with you, actually, which is why put me up to this. You know, that's so strange, because I feel so normal. It's so strange to hear stuff like that because I feel so normal. Yeah, but you live a pretty blessed life. Come on, admit it. You wouldn't trade it tobe slinging beers at a bar. Don't-- don't give her the sob story. You're right. It is fun. I've been very lucky. But let's stop talking about me. But let's not talk about me. OK. Now take her hand. Good. No, no. What are you doing? What are you-- don't. Don't kiss her. Um-- Sorry. This is-- this is all justhappening a little too fast. So-- You blew it. You totally blew it. I didn't tell you to kiss her. The timing was all off. Timing? What are you talking about? OK, ladies, lots of energy. We're dancing, smiling, high, high energy. OK, and rolling. Music. I think you and I have a lotin common, you know, with the-- the need to explore ourselvesthrough other characters. I mean, we are both actors, famous or not. Nothing that they say aboutyou in the tabloids is true. Come on. Ryan, come and dance. Come on. Come on, guy. Hey. Hey. There'san energy that's here. Dance all night. Dance all night. So, um, do you think I have the qualities to be Mrs. Ryan Banks? Who are you betting on? I like Lauren, the actress. I like Mindy. And Charlie, of course. You think so? Please. She's the perfect candidate. Charlie, come on back out and dance. I'm just going to take a break for a little while.- Yeah? Oh! Hey, Dave, back off a little bit, will you? No. You know what? I'm really OK. I'm-- I'm just going to gooutside and get some air. Truthfully, this whole thingis just a little weird. Not too weird for you, is it? Not too weird for me. Hey, I'm sorry about that. Hi. Oh, it's OK. Is this what you have to go through these days to get a date? Well, why fall in loveif you can't do it on TV? Is that how you met your girlfriend? No, I'm single. Oh. There must be a very goodreason you're single. Well, I could probably saythe same thing about you. You know, if I ever want to really meet somebody, the obvious choice is just have my own show. I want to marry. Right. That'd be great. Yeah. I'm, uh-- I'm sorry I'm so agh. It's just that Ryan's really sweet. It's just so hard to get toknow the real him this way. No. Is it really? Yeah. FEMALE SINGERS I want to marry Ryan Banks. Welcome back. America, you've alreadychosen Mindy, Dana, Jessica. , Next key, please. Charlie. And the finalgirl to remain in the race for Ryan Banks's heart. We have-- Lauren. Yay. You're meeting with the director, two producers, Nicole may or may not be there. Now, remember, this is theone movie you want to land. This is Oscar caliber. I'll land it, buddy. Don't worry. Hey, what was with Charlie at the club? I just think she's freakedout by all this stuff. But she's the only one, right? Oh, yeah. Then she's got to be more intoit, or it's not going to work. You're a producer. Talk to her. Take her out of here. Give her a pep talk. I can't take her outside the house. Take her to my house. No one will know. Do it tonight. Kareen will make you dinner. Mm. Yeah, I could definitely get used to living here. So you're planning on winning? Oh, yeah. Mm, I think I'll put aeast wing right over there. But for now, it'll do. So the real reason we're here is I just want to make you feelmore comfortable about doing the show. I am trying. And I do like him, you know. It just-- you have to admit thiswhole thing's a little weird. I have to admit it is a little weird. You so do not seem like oneof these Hollywood type people. How did you get involved in all this? Um, Ryan and I have been friends forever. We moved out here. One thing led to another, andit just sort of made sense to go into business together. So what did you want to do before one thing led to another? I don't remember. A friend's business-- allin one, that has to be hard. How so? Well, he's Ryan Banks, and your whole life revolves around that. You want to get some fresh air? Go for a walk? Oh, there's nowhere to walk in that way. Doesn't he have, like, a 40 acre property? Yeah, I can't wait to go home, hang out at my sister's bar. I'd kind of love tochuck all this for a week, go back home, and see it sometime. That's so weird. Ryan said the exact same thing. Did he really? Uh-huh. That's probably because he's from Boston too. God, how sad is it I've never been down here? It's my best friend's own private beach. You work too much. Yeah, at a job I don'tremember choosing, right? That sounds like someone else I know. Who? Well, after college, youknow, my dad got really sick. And he couldn't run the bookstore. I was going to go to journalism school. But I knew he secretlywanted me to run the store. So I did. Here I am eight years later. Do you like it? Oh, enough. I mean, I love the people that come in. But I did it for him. This is the most normal I'vefelt since I've gotten to LA. It's really nice. I wish you could stay longer. Me too. It's getting cold. Yeah. I mean, you'd think in California-- Right, right. In the movies, they always, uh, go swimming a lot. Yes. You're changing everything. You're changing everything. Right from the start, it came from my heart. You're changing everything. My everything. With you. What did we just do? So I'm thinking we should, uh-- Yeah, definitely. It was-- It was a mistake. Yes. It wasn't my place to-- Oh, but it wasn't your fault. Even if it wasn't my fault, still-- It was really nice, though. Oh, it was-- it was really nice. It was really nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. OK, yeah. Great. OK, good night. Good night. Oh, I was just leaving. How'd it go? I got the part. Oh, nice work, my man. Oh, OK. We'll negotiate on Monday. Good, good, good. How'd it go with Charlie? Uh, she'll be fine. She's just getting adjustedto the cameras and stuff. It was a good-- it was agood move taking her out. Right on. You the man. OK. Oh, so if it gets down to her and someone else, you'll pick her? Yeah, sure. I guess so. Although I got to tell you, the idea of getting married is no more attractive thanit was three weeks ago. But the point is you gotto pick somebody at the end. Yeah, sure. So I guess I'll pick her. It's just that Charlie seems pretty into it. You know, if you don't feel the same way, maybe you should focus yourefforts on somebody else who's not going to be so let downafter you dump them two weeks after the show's over. Why? I should pick the one that America likes best. That's what you've always said. Yeah, I'm just saying she's a cool girl. You know, you don't want to mess her up. OK. Don't worry, man. All right. Good night. Welcome back. If you're just joining us, America has made their decision in the countdown to the heart of Ryan Banks. Jessica, Mindy, Lauren, and Charlie. Sorry, Dana. If she's like that now, imagine her with kids. Good choice, America. Next week on "I Want to Marry Ryan Banks," you'll see Ryan on a romantic dinner date with each of the four remaining girls. We'll see you next time. FEMALE SINGERS I want to marry Ryan Banks. You know, ever since we've met, I just feel like we have this thing, you know? It's really good. Yeah. Um, because I just-- I've never felt this way with anybody before. Well, how manyrelationships have you had? I mean, you're pretty young, aren't you? Yeah. But I know what I want when I see it. Mm. Wow. Here's to you. Cheers. How about your favorite video game? Oh, you're a gamer? Yeah. I'm kind of a pro. I'm all about "Tron 2.0" right now. No way. Me too. What version are you up to? 9.82. 10.0.0. Yeah, I got all the build points too. Whoa. Did you beat the lightcycler, or did you skip it? Beat it. Have you played online yet? No, not yet. Yeah, death match and team death match. Oh, you gotta do it. You're my idol. Yeah, I just-- I feel like you're reallyromantic underneath it all. I don't know. You know, we should, um-- we should go to the wine country or Carmel. Oh, get a roomsomewhere, taste some wine, listen to classical music in our bathrobes. A romantic. Caught. So you know, I just feel like we have this, um-- this unbelievable connection. What's your favorite book? Uh, I'm not really a book guy. I'm more of a movie guy. So where do you see yourself down the line? Um, you know, I want to settledown, get married, have kids. Well, then, what if I didn'twant to live in Hollywood? Oh, that's OK. We can have more than one house. I can be here doing my thing. And uh, you can live withthe kids wherever you want. Well, but then we're not really together. And you know, if we're going to be together, then I'd want to be spendingmore time with you-- you know, quality time. Right. Um, that's a good thing to-- to talk about. Um, could you excuse me for one second? All right, cut. Let's cut it. Why aren't you helping me? You should be able to handle this. Are you kidding me? No. Don't let me down now. And roll cameras. Cue harp. Sorry. I was just saying that-- Let me know what you think. It's one step at a time. I was just saying that we should take this one step at a time. And we barely know each other. I mean, we barely know each other. And I think that these decisions-- we should make together when the time comes. And I think we should make those decisions together when the time comes. That's a really good answer. So Iwas wondering how I could be so torn between two guys. And I realize now that I'm not. No. Ryan's a great guy. And I think you should gofor it, if you think that-- Yeah, yeah. Ryan's great on paper, you know? But there's never been any real spark. And I couldn't figure out how he kept saying all the right things. And I realize now that he wasn't. And this is all fake. And you were saying them the whole time. Not the whole time. Uh-huh. When he found me upstairs in the hallway? Uh, yeah, I was there. And by the hot tub? He didn't know the answerto the crossword puzzle. And that walk in thegarden when he kissed me. Yes, but I didn't tell him to kiss you. That was all him.- I didn't want him to kiss me. I know. I know. It was totally the wrong moment.- Completely the wrong moment. Yeah. So it's you. - OK, I should go. - No, don't go. I need to go. Look, it's my fault. You need to do the show. And eventually, you'llwind up falling for Ryan. Everybody does. Keep your eyes closed. OK, OK. This way. This way. I got you. I got you. OK, you can open your eyes. Patrick, what is this? You haven't been on one in a while. So I thought this would be a good idea. Patrick, this isn't like you. I know you like the romance. And if I want to keep you around, I figure I have to step it up. Congratulations, ladies. America's spoken. The three of you remain. You must be so excited. Jessica, I'm sorry totell you that America has taken you out of the running. That's totally fine. I'm totally fine with that. Yeah, you just keep telling yourself that. Next week, stay tuned as we seeRyan on an exotic vacation date with each of the three remaining girls. We'll see you next time. So when this is allover, if you're not picked, I would love to take you out. That's perfect. I mean, she obviously likes you. And Ryan obviously cares for her as much as he's cared about any othergirl, which is like care factor of zero. So you're not a bad friend. Are you sure? Yes. Todd, you have to go after this. You deserve to be happy too. But you're going to have to waituntil after the show is over. It's Todd. Hey, it's Charlie. Hey. CHARLIE NORTON: So, um, Lauren's on her date with Ryan in Carmel. And there's barely anybody here. And I'm starving. You want to bring over a pizza or something? OK. We're good. We have to continually avoid that. Huh. It was nice having dinner withyou and Ryan the other night. You and I make a pretty good date, don't we? Yeah. Look, you and I both knowthat it's not really going to happen between Ryan and me. And he knows that too. Yeah, I don't know. So we're going to let a TV show get in the way of whatever this is? It's my show that I created for him. And you're the favorite. It just seems like you have sacrificed everything in your life for the sake of his. I've never had anyone paythis much attention to me. And not because I only just met you. Duck. Oh. Oh. Mm. Mm. OK, you have to let me off the show. Oh, that's not possible. America would be up in arms. There has to be another solution. Maybe you could just start pretending you're the biggest loser onearth, make America hate you. Then they'll vote you off. Oh, my-- that's it. What? No, that's it. I was to go to Victoria withRyan this weekend, right? Well, I'll just start acting like the biggest tool on the planet. Ryan will be repulsed. And America will vote me off. And that's it. Oh, that's kind of brilliant. It was your idea. You know, you really should start taking some credit for yourself. I'm going to be the worstdate Ryan has ever had. This is insane. Oh. Mm. I think I'm getting sick. Sure you need this many bags? We're only here for two days. You can never be too prepared. Oh. Hey. Hey, guys, back off a little bit, will you? I don't like this hotel. This place is a dump. Oh, thank you for going shopping with me. Know how much I hate sightseeing. Plus, I need to find something to wear to your next big premiere. Oh, this-- stop it. Amazing, right? Oh, thank you. Oh, and this. This I will wear to your second premiere, when I'm Mrs. Ryan Banks. Thank you. I hope you brought your checkbook. Cut. Um, a couple of dragon rolls, definitely. Huh. Thanks. You know, I would like a Chinese chicken salad. Charlie, this is a Japanese restaurant. Hmm? Um, so you can make surethat the chicken isn't cooked in oil, and that thelettuce is triple washed, and the dressing is egg-free. Thank you. This is super. Are you having as much fun as I am? I'm trying to. Oh. What came over her? At least it'll mix it up a little bit. Let's see just howsteamy Ryan and Lauren got. You know, I didn't come intothis expecting to fall for you. But you surprised me in every single way. You made me surprised myself. Ryan and Mindy took a funtrip up to San Francisco, where there was no shortageof bonding activity. Have a good trip, skipper. Thanks. What do you got? Ah. Here we go. It's not bad. Oh-- I win. What's that? Feed me. Oh, my goodness. We can go to the redwoods. I know. OrAlcatraz, or just stay in. That sounds good. Now let's go to glorious Victoria, Canada, where the sparks between Ryan and Charlie got even hotter. Amazing hotel, right? Oh, thank you. When I'm Mrs. Ryan Banks. Mrs. Ryan Banks. This is super. I mean, are you having as much fun as I am? Yep. I don't get it. I thought she said she sabotaged it. Ooh. Now pick up thosephones and cast your vote with AT&T. This is your last chance to affect the outcome, takingit down to the final two. One of those two will be Mrs. Ryan Banks. We'll see you all tomorrow nightwhen we're joined by Ryan's last three leading ladies. Good night, everyone. FEMALE SINGERS I want to marry Ryan Banks. Leslie. Leslie, that footage was a complete lie. That is blatantly notwhat happened in Victoria. Isn't this what you want? She's the one you want America to pick. The other two won't donearly as much for his career as she will. Lauren's too desperate, and he and Mindy are more like friends. You didn't even consult with me. I don't have to. I'm the network. And we want ratings, which means we have to keep this neck andneck until the last episode. I owe you. I owe you guys one. Do you know how ridiculous Iwould have looked with Charlie in Victoria if you wouldn't have pulled that amazing editing job? Mm. It was awesome. This is unbelievable. What's with him? That was Lauren and Ryan in Carmel. And finally, as a reminder, let's take a look at Ryan's vacation date with Charlie. Amazing hotel, right? Oh, thank you. When I'm Mrs. Ryan Banks. Mrs. Ryan Banks. This is super. I mean, are you having as much fun as I am? Yep. Ooh. Well, America, you have made your choice. Let's see which two girls Ryanwill eventually choose from. Lauren, will you accept this key to my heart? Yes, of course. Charlie. Thank you. Can you accept this key to my heart? Yes, of course. So tonight, we bid farewell to Mindy, who the viewers seem to think was more of a friend than a lover. Hmm. Can't feel good, Mind. Can't feel good. That means next week, Ryan will choose. Will it be Charlie, oris it going to be Lauren? Find out next week. Good night. And we are clear. I don't know exactly what that was. But that was not me. I cannot do this anymore. I'm done. OK, listen, I understandwhy you're upset. I completely understand, Charlie. But you can't quit the show. Yes, I can! This entire show is a complete sham. I would be disrespecting myself if I didn't quit! Hey, whatever that was, go fix it. Charlie, it's time. We have nothing to talk about. Hey, look. Look, I'm angry about what they did too, OK? Mm-hmm. Hey, you know, they editedthis whole thing without me even knowing about it. All right. This whole thing hasgotten entirely out of hand. I had nothing to do with this. Yeah, but you knew, didn't you? You knew, and you didn't tell me. I didn't know until last night. You know, and this wholeacting like an idiot thing, it was your idea. It was going to work. You were perfect. Well,I'm glad you were amused. Problem is you didn't holdup your end of the bargain. You are no better than anyone else around here. I did fall for somebody here, but it's not Ryan Banks. It was you. I just wish I had morerespect for you than I do. Bottom line, Todd, this whole show is a joke. And I'm not going to be a part of it anymore. - Charlie, Charlie. - What? Sorry to interrupt. The next time you want tohave a conversation like this, I suggest you take off your microphone. You're fired. Literally, for as long as I can remember, it's been this way. You are so far out in left field with this. You're just too obsessed with Ryan Banks to think about anybody else's life. Are you kidding me with this? You know, for the past 10 years, it's been my job to obsess about Ryan Banks. That's right. You wanted to work for me. No, I didn't. Look, I don't blame you, Ryan. You are who you are, andI helped you become that. But somewhere along the line, I just completely lost myself. And then I met her. And I tried to resist it. And for once, I did something for myself. I put work and your careerfirst in my life forever. And it took her to make me realize that. I'm sorry you feel that way. Oh, listen-- listen, man. You've been the best friend I could ask for. We've had a great ride. It's just now, it's time for me to figure out what else my life is about. So what are you going to do? I don't know. So how exactly was Ryan as a kisser? Oh, he was good. Did I ask you to be vague? Oh, can you get that? Yeah. Hello? Can I ask who's calling? Todd from LA. She's not here. Can I take a message for her? OK, I'll tell her. Bye. Poor guy. Look, it is an impossible situation that is not worth dealing with. Charlie Norton? That's me. How can they sue me? Remember that thick document you signed? Well, if you choose to cooperate and continue your commitment to theshow, Ryan, and the crew, we'll be coming to your house tomorrow. What? I'm going to have to get my hair done. Trish, focus. Right. OK. So listen, you're goingto have to finish it out. Is that the worst thing in the world? I can't. So he picks you, you're all smiles on TV, and then you come home. Charlie, they got you. You agreed to do this, you signed that document, and you are not a quitter. Look, sweetie. I hate to sound like an annoying big sister. But just because this is tough doesn't mean you get to walk away. Why are you always right? Think of it this way. You go, you take nakedpictures of him, you come home. We sell them on eBay. Ow. Charlie's in Boston. So we've turned a problem into a solution. He'll go meet both girls' families. It'll be great. Very boy next door meets girl next door. And Charlie won't be able to say no. How do you know? We're working something new into the show. If the girl Ryan picks says yes, she wins a million dollars. I am so glad I created this show. Brilliant idea. You were just doing your job. Yeah. What am I going to do? She won't return my calls. You want to know what I'd do? I would get on a plane and go visit her. You can't just sit here. I mean, you fell for her, and I've never seen you do that before. And she fell for you, andthat happens, like, once out of every 100 million times. You guys are meant to be together. Oh, my god. Ah! They're here! Charlie! Patrick! Ugh. I've got to keep them straight. Hi. Hi. Hi, Charlie. Hi. Hello. Last time we met, I fainted on the floor. Oh, that's right. That's right. It's good to see you again. Be more careful this time, will you? OK. Come in. Come in. Hi. Come in. Wrapped here. Come in. So I'm glad we got out of Los Angeles. Give you a chance to be yourself more. And we can get to know each other better. And I promise, this time wewon't mess with the edit. OK. You said it. I'm game. All right, then. Camera, take your position, please. Ready, guys? Just act natural. Slate, and roll camera. And action. So Charlie, tell me-- thanks. Tell me, before you met me, oranyone else, what kind of guy were you looking for? Someone honest, someone kind, funny. Someone who knows how to listen. And do you feel like I'm any of those things? Yeah, sort of. I think you're very funny. You know, but there are otherthings that I like about you. Um, you say how you feel, you're very passionate, you know what you want. All that's absolutely true. See you in LA. Bye. Bye. Have a good night. All right, let's go. I, uh-- I somehow ended up on a big machine in the sky. And, uh, it landed in this city. And I, uh-- I thought I'd pay you a visit. Obviously, I wasn't the only one. Yeah, well, I was going to beslapped with a million dollar lawsuit if I didn't let him in. All I have to do is showup for the final ceremony. Right. Come in. Thanks. Hi. Hi. Uh, and if he picks you? I say yes, I get a milliondollars, and I blow it off. Really? Or I say no, I lose a million dollars, and I keep working at a bookstore. Really? Mm. Oh, I, uh-- I found this on your porch. Thank you. Do you know how rare this is? I was wondering. What are you doing every day this week? No plans yet. I was just fine alone for so long on my own. Love was to me a fairy tale. Self-sufficient, independent. What was love? I didn't need it till it all went out the window the moment you said hello. I need your love in the middle of the day. I need your love to sleep away. I need your love with every breath I take. Need your love like I've never needed anyone. You're everything to me. I need your love. Don't wreck my heart. Need your love every minute of the day. I need your love to sleep away. I need your love with every breath-- OK, America. We are back on the final live episode of "I Want to Marry Ryan Banks." Ryan Banks. You'vechosen two women for him. He's met their families, spentmore time with them one on one. And now he says he's made his final decision. Thanks for sneaking me in. Well, like you're not going to be here when this all goes down. All right, I will come and get you later so you can be there forCharlie when this is all over. OK. Hey, Lauren. I have had the most wonderful time with you. You're charming, andambitious, and beautiful. I really feel like we made a connection. And obviously, America felt it as well. Yes. But I don't think we're a match. What? If I'm goingto settle down with someone, I want us to complement eachother with our differences. And the fact that we're both actors, it's a little close to home. I was so ready to give that up for you. No, but I want whoever I'mwith to have their own life, you know? Unbelievable. Sorry. Hi, Charlie. You got to be kidding me. Charlie Norton, will youmarry my friend, Todd Doherty? It's OK. It's OK. Yes. Yes, of course. What? I'm sure you're wonderingwho Todd Doherty is. Todd is my best friend. He's my manager. And I'm pretty sure he'supstairs in my room right now. Now, the entire time you, America, thought Charlie and I were falling in love, it was really Charlie and Todd. Now, I know Todd tried to resist her at first. But knowing Charlie, that's pretty tough. You see, the editing of theshow displayed something false, something that wasn't there. But I'm happy to say thata real love connection was made on the show. It just didn't involve me. And when I realized what was happening, I was-- I was furious at first. But after a lot of thinking, I realized what I had to do. And with the help of a security camera and a few very dedicated undercover operatives, I think I succeeded. What am I going to do? She won't take my calls. You want to know what I would do? I would get on a plane and go visit her. You can't just sit here. So through Todd's assistant, Nikki, I encouraged him to go after her. So I had Nikki book his ticket-- Oh, you did not. Ha, ha, ha. --Just so you could see how perfect they are together. And her brother-in-law, Patrick, helped out with the whole thing. Of course, I still had to go to Boston myself to hang out with Charlie and her family. Now, you thought I was goingthere to meet and impress. But really, I was there tomake sure that she and Todd were indeed a perfect match. What kind of guy were you looking for? Um, someone honest, someone kind, someone funny. Someone who knew how to listen. That is so Todd. You have to go downstairs. No, I'm not going. Yeah, go get her, Todd. Todd. Todd, go get her. OK, go do it. OK, I promise. Go, go. Personalexperience-- they can't know-- Oh. As forme, I discovered that I don't really want to settle down. I'm more of a bachelor at heart. But I may have a future in matchmaking. And thanks to Nikki, I do believe Todd's going to be with us momentarily. There he is. He's the reason I have a career. He's my best friend in the world. And I'm going to give himthe 15 minutes of fame that he never had. Ha, ha, ha. Did you know about this? So, um-- do you want to marry me? I'm kidding.
