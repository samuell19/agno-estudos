[Skateboard wheels scratching] - Our lives had been so beautiful, filled with grace and joy and promise.

But it wasn't until college that we fell in love and were married. After graduation, we came back to mount Eden... bill to teach, I to raise our family. For us, it was like returning home in triumph. When I was 27, I left my body for the first time. I was so naive and unprepared. I didn't know such things could happen. - Hey, mom. When are we gonna eat? - I'm so embarrassed. I forgot to buy enough food, so you're gonna have to wait till breakfast. You don't mind, do you? There's lots of oatmeal. - You're crazy. What are we having? - Hmm. - [ Laughing ] Stop it! - Get him, mom! Tickle fight! - Truce! - [ Singsong ] You can't get me! You can't get me! You can't get me! - Boo! - Aah! - You guys go outside and play and let me finish my cooking. - How can I have any fun if she's around? - How can you have any fun if she isn't? - Where's daddy? - Daddy's upstairs talking to the boys, and I don't want you bothering them. - Bummer. - Bummer? [ Door opens ] - Mom, there's a bird caught in the badminton net. I think its wing is busted. - His name is Henry. Can we keep him? - How do you know his name is Henry? - Gabey told me. - Oh. - I'm serious, Dave. Where do you think you'll be able to go? - I don't know, Mr. Kunen. I guess I'll worry about that when the time comes. - You're halfway through your junior year. The time has come. - Well, maybe I don't even want to go to college. - Good. With grades like this, you're not going to. English... "D." I thought you wanted to be a writer. - You don't have to go to college to be a writer. I mean, who knows where Richard farina went? - Who? - "Been down so long it looks like up to me?" It's the coolest book ever written. That's the kind of stuff we should be studying. - Keep wasting your time. - By the way, you're getting a "d" in economics from me, too. You're about an inch from an "f." How do you think your parents are gonna react to these grades? - You're not gonna send those out, are you? If they think I'm failing again, they're gonna send me to military school. - That's not my fault. You're the one who's not doing the work. Mr. Bainbridge is still waiting for your short story assignment. - It's almost done! - Oh, don't be so hard on them. Those are just his mid-semesters. He can pull them up by the end of the term. Can't you, Davey? I didn't mean to interrupt the chewing out. I just want to tell you dinner's ready. - That's all right. [ As Jimmy Durante ] I think I've done enough masticatin' for one evening, Mrs. Calabash. - Corn ball. [ Both laugh ] - Hold it! - Oh. Mommy said to tell you dinner's ready. - I did? - How'd you get here so fast? - I flew, like Henry. - Dad! We found a bird. He's got a busted wing. - His name is Henry. We're gonna keep him. - Oh, we are? - We have to. He's sick. - Well, maybe until his wing gets better, then I'm sure he'll have something to say about it. Come on, brats. - [ Chuckles ] - Show me the bird. Now, I want to hear some real studying going on up here tonight, which means I don't want to hear anything. I still haven't decided whether or not to send these grades to your parents. - Bummer. - Don't worry. I'll talk to him. But, Davey, you have to show some responsibility. A little initiative. Can I count on you? - Yes, ma'am. - [ Laughs ] - I don't know what you think is so funny, Mr. Chase. We'll get to your grades tomorrow. - [ Sighs ] - Oh. Watch out for boardwalk. It's a little shaky. - Can I give you a hand? - No, I'm all right. Thank you. - She said she's all right. And, Edgerton. - Yes, sir? - Get a haircut. - Psychosomatic. - I'm so sick of this fucking school I could kill myself. - Don't do that, Davey. You'd break Mrs. Kunen's heart. - Son of a bitch didn't even help her down the stairs. [ Sighs ] I don't know about you guys, but I need after-lights-out brew. - You got beer? - [ Laughing ] All right! - I told them I didn't know if I could get a sitter. - What about Milly? - You know she charges too much. - What I meant was I’d take her to the movies. You can watch the kids. - Honey... Are you really gonna send Davey's parents mid-semesters? - You don't give up, do you? - No. [ Sighs ] He's a good kid. He just needs a little encouragement. - He's like the classic screw-up. - I thought you said he had the highest board scores in the class. - That's just the point. He should also have the highest grades. You think I like being so hard on him? - Mm, yes. - That's why I have to keep pressure on him. Make him tough. Otherwise he'll just stay lazy. - That approach won't work with Davey. He's not like the others. - It's the same approach they used on me and it worked just fine. Come on, Helen. Let me handle this. It's what I'm paid for. - Davey's a free spirit. You can't stifle that. You have to nurture it. - Helen, this isn't some local high school. This is mount Eden. We don't nurture free spirits. We prepare boys to lead. If you can't respect authority, can't make the cut, you're out. Survival of the fittest. You okay? - [ Grunting ] Yeah. I'm fine. It's not that I don't think you're doing a good job, because I do. It's just that I know Davey is capable of great things. - You're relentless. All right. I'll think about it. - Thank you. Coming to sleep? - You go ahead without me. [ As Jimmy Durante ] I'll catch up with you, Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are. - [ Sighs ] You're the one who's relentless. - Ha-Cha-Cha! It's just that I really do have to finish this for tomorrow. [ Bell tolls ] - Ow! Mommy! - Johnny, I want you to stop that. - I didn't do anything. - He hit me! - All right! That's enough! [ Bird caws ] I want these toys out of here and the two of you ready for breakfast, and I mean fast. - Henry! Henry! Henry! - Stop teasing Henry. He's not used to being in a cage. - I'm not teasing him. I love him. - Well, love him a little less intensely. - You're incredible. I don't know where you get the strength. I couldn't do this all day. Any more juice? - I'll get it. - No, that's okay. - I said I'll get it. [ Bird caws ] Bill. - Mm? - Did you ever have a dream where you could fly? - How do you mean? - You know, fly. As if you could fly. - Sure. Everyone has flying dreams. Why? Did you have one? - Yes, last night. It was the weirdest thing. I've never had a dream like that before in my life. - Hmm. - The first thing I remember is I was outside the house, and then I looked down and I saw that I was suspended over the roof, and at first I was afraid because I didn't know what was going on, and then I realized I was flying. And then as soon as I got used to that idea, I suddenly became... Conscious of everyone in the world. As if I were linked to them, as if their thoughts were mine. And then I dreamed I was at Milly and Lee's and I had flown over there... - You didn't happen to see our lawn mower while you were over there. - I'm serious. - Okay. Go ahead. - Well, they had a terrible argument and I saw the whole thing and that's all. - I hope she didn't hit him again. Last time, he was in a cast for two months. - Very funny. I-I'll get it. Amy, Johnny, your breakfast is getting cold! - Oh. Bye. - Your juice. - Too late. Got to go. - Why do you always do that? I'm working here. - Sorry! You kids better get down here right away. Your mother's got a bug up her ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies. [ Bird chirps ] - [ Sighs ] [ Door slams ] - All right. See you there. [ Indistinct conversations ] - Hard night? - Yeah, boy, we really did some studying last night. - Really burned that midnight oil, huh? - Yeah. It... it was rough. - That's what I like to hear. - Good morning, gentlemen. Let us say grace. Lord, for what we are about to eat, we thank you. Amen. - All: Amen. [ Bird caws ] - [ Gasps ] - Come on. Can't you just give me till after the weekend? I just... - Mr. Edgerton, you're completely missing the point I've been so painfully trying to make. I'm no longer concerned with your failure to complete the assignment. - I'm sorry? - Now I'm concerned with what I believe is a patent lack of ability to complete it. I asked you to write the story four weeks ago. Am I boring you? - No, Mr. Bainbridge. - I certainly hope not. I'd hate for you to think of me as a wet blanket on the vacation you apparently find mount Eden to be. Allow me. It is precisely 10 past 4:00. I do hope I'm not keeping you from something more important. - Well, I have to be at chapel at 4:15. - Mm. - If I'm late, I'll have to go in front of the disciplinary committee again. I'll get kicked out. You'll have to find someone else to pick on. - Very well put. I hope Mr. Kunen enjoys that little remark as much as I did. - [ Sighs ] - Go. - All: ♪ rock of ages, cleft for me - both: ♪ silent night ♪ holy night ♪ all is calm - all: ♪ from thy wounded - together: ♪ holy infant so tender and mild ♪ - All: ♪ safe from wrath and make me pure ♪ - ♪ sleep in heavenly peace - together: ♪ sleep in heavenly peace - all: ♪ amen - chapel was mandatory at Eastbrook, too. So what did you guys decide about helping with the dance preparations? - I forgot. I have a class. - M-Me too. - I have to study. - Now I know you're lying. - Today I'd like to talk about education. Proverbs. - Amy, stop pestering Milly. - We better put the punch over here and the refreshments on a long table over there. - Ruth. It's the same way we did it last year. In fact, that's the same way we've done it since we were in school. - Not so. Last year, we put the punch over here and the refreshments over there. - If you worked as hard on your basketball as you do on your sarcasm, Mildred, we might have won the regionals your senior year. - We're here to talk about the dance, not basketball. Now, every year we do the same thing in the same place, and the boys end up on one side of the gym and the girls on the other. - Mommy, do it with me. - Not now, sweetie. - Well, I got to get back to Eastbrook. Field hockey. - Ruth, I came up with some really great ideas. I did some sketches. Can I show them to you at the meeting on Wednesday? - Of course. I love to hear new ideas. - And ignore them. - But please... be prompt next time and get some rest. You look run down. And, uh, work on that lay up, Mildred. You drive with the fall so far from the body I could take it away in one second. [ Laughs ] - Word for word what she's told every girl for the past 20 years. If Bob Cousy were here, she'd say the same thing. - Oh, it's diabolical. She must be stopped. We can't let her keep putting the punch over there and the refreshments over there until even Amy's old enough to date. Milly, I'm a little worried. - Amy. The ball. Too far from your body. I'm sorry. What were you gonna say? Helen, your hand. - Oh, it's just a little strained from vacuuming. - Let me see. - It's nothing. Really. [ Sighs ] - Is that what's troubling you, bunky? - No. I was worried about you and Lee. - [ Laughing ] Us? Like two peas in a... Thick, murky, pea soup. Okay, so we had a fight. That just put some pepper in the soup. - What did you fight about? - That job at Wilson's. [ Scoffs ] I don't know why he thinks it's any of his business if I want to work outside the house. - Milly. I dreamt I saw the whole thing. - You're kidding. - [ Chuckles ] - You must have esp. - It was only a dream. You have the same fight every night. - Didn't you ever have the phone ring and you knew exactly who was calling? Well, that's a kind of esp. Maybe it was your spirit traveling. - What? - Yogis do it all the time. They leave their bodies and go wherever they want. - I don't know why people are so fascinated with that nonsense. It's embarrassing. [ Sighs ] But you better watch what you say from now on. Big sister might be watching. - [ Laughs ] How's that feel now? - That's perfect. - [ Sniffs ] Chanel no. 69. What's this? - It's a letter. - No duh. From who? - It's from Lucy small. - Lucy small? No way. - Yes way. So what? She's just a kid. - Some kid I want to babysit. - [ Chuckles ] - Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! - Helen. Are you all right? - You know what you said about... - About what, sweetie? - I'm fine. [ Laughing ] I just dozed off. Oh, sweetie. It's okay. Mommy was just taking a nap. Let's go home. Davey. You decided to help after all. - Don't let it bother you. - It doesn't. - Worry about the day the crushes stop and you'd give anything for a look like that. - I don't get it, Mrs. Kunen. Everybody's always riding my case. They just don't like me 'cause I'm different. - Plenty of people look me and think "different." Doesn't stop me from doing everything I have to. - Well, it's no fun. - You're here for an education. Not fun. - I've been down so long, looks like up to me. Forget it. - We all want to have fun. But we have responsibilities, too. Mr. Kunen's is to see that you get an education. Mine is to raise a family. You're lucky. The only responsibility your parents gave you is to learn. - No, the only reason my parents want me to learn is so I can become some sort of doctor or lawyer or buy a better car or get a bigger house. Well, that's not what's important to me. I mean, I didn't ask to be born. I got to do what I want to do, not them. I mean, your generation had 1,000 years to screw everything up. The least they can do is give us a chance to make it better. - I didn't know I'd been around for that long. - You know what I mean. - Yes, I do. That's why I'm amazed you don't want to learn as much as you can. Before you can change the world, you have to understand how it's built. I read everything I can get my hands on, no mater what its point of view. - Yeah, right. - I do. - Well, maybe you're just smarter than me. - Well, that just goes without saying. - [ Chuckles ] What about your writing? Did you finish your story for English yet? I'd like to read that, too. - If I ever give bainbridge the story of the stuff that's really in my head, it'd blow his mind. Maybe yours, too. - So what's stopping you? Blow my mind. [ Chuckles ] Your problem is you think you can tear down the world by studying for one hour and playing guitar for two. That's not the way it works. If you put the time and effort into it, you'll get your chance. I promise. R.i.p. - What? - It's our new motto. Only we'll know. - Rest in peace? - Responsibility, initiative, progress. Rip! - Rest in peace is better. This place is killing me. - Come on! Say it! Rip! - No, it's not too likely. Are you... - I'm fine. I'm fine. [ Sighs ] Davey, why can't I count on you? - Look, what can I say? I'll try. - Don't try. Do it. - I'll do it. For you. - I'm very, very flattered. But don't do it for me. Do it for yourself. Remember. Everything you can get your hands on. - Richard farina! - We still have an hour before I have to start dinner. I could help you with your history exam. - You should be the teacher. - [ Laughs ] Don't think so. - You don't just have to stay home with the kids. Go out. Do your own thing. The times they are a-changin'. - One teacher in the family is enough. - Well... You haven't got one yet. - Give him a chance. He wants to help. - You should never trust anyone over 30. - Bill's only 29. - No way. - [ Groans ] Oh, bill! Remember... Be kind to your elders! - Match point. Again. Don't blow it. - Bill, don't wimp out on me now! - Kunen, don't you ever give up? - Never. - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. [ Indistinct talking ] - Hey, um... bill. I spoke to shays, and if you want, there's no problem having edgerton transferred to another house. - What are you talking about? - [ Chuckles ] Come on, bill. You know. - No, I don't. - Milly says everybody thinks you ought to get him out. - What are we... Milly's latest hot topic? - No, we just thought you have enough problems as it is. You don't need some love struck kid... - Jesus, Lee. Do you really think I care what a bunch of old hens are clucking about this week? - Come on, bill. That hen is my wife. [ Chuckles ] - And Helen's mine. Hey. What is this? I'm teasing with you! - I was only trying to help. Don't you think I know that? Everything's going great. We don't have any problems. So forget about it, huh? - Sure. - Hey. Come here. Huh? [ Laughs ] - Hey! Hey! Hey! Kunen! Are you out of your mind?! - Come on! We'll do a few laps. - My racket! You're dead, buddy! - Charlemagne. - How could it have been Charlemagne? He'd already been dead for 70 years. - Right. I mean, Charles ii? - Dead. - Charles I? - Dead. - Charles Mingus? - [ Chuckles ] Charles III. Ransomed Paris in 1886 and allowed the Norsemen to ransack burgundy. - Right, I know. I know. I... was just testing you. - Well. I won't say I'm amazed, but I am. This almost looks like studying. So I hate to break it up. Dave and I are about to have one of our little meetings. I spoke to Mr. Bainbridge. I'll see you upstairs. - Right. Thanks. - Bill... - You know, I really appreciate your help but I don't need you mollycoddling him. - No, but if you just... - I told you I'm keeping the pressure on that boy until I get results. [ Sighs ] Meanwhile, what's with the living room? It's like a small nuclear device went off in there. I'm sorry. I didn't mean... [ Slams door ] [ Crying softly ] - [ Crying ] [ Gasps ] [ Alarm clock buzzing ] [ Alarm clock stops ] - How'd you sleep? - Sorry? - You look tired. How'd you sleep? - Beautifully. Just... beautifully. - Free. Free... What an incredible sensation. How long I denied I was even a prisoner. - Oh, excuse me! - Oh! - What do you think you're doing? Stop it this instant! - She took my comic book! - I did not! It's my comic book! - I don't care whose it is, you can't behave like this in here. Where's your mother? - Shopping. - She's gonna hand you your heads on a platter. Helen. Helen! Your children... Helen? - How different, how wonderful this new life was. Every day, I would go about my normal routine. I would feed my family, clean the house. But I always knew in the back of my mind that soon I would sleep. And then, only then, would I be free. Free to fly. Free to roam the world. - Mrs. Kunen, I finished my story. - That's wonderful, Davey. Mr. Kunen will be pleased. - I thought maybe you could take a look at it. - Oh, I can't right now. I'm very tired. I have to lie down. - Oh, okay. Yeah. - Well, maybe I can. - Yeah? Let me get these. - [ Grunts ] "The wooden horse." - I have a class, so we better get started. - I'm sure she'll be along any second. - You'd think this was a meeting of the joint chiefs of staff. You can fill her in later. - But she wanted you to see her idea. She's been working so hard on it. - [ Sighs ] - Well, I'm not surprised she's late. She's been acting so odd. Walking around with that "Mona Lisa" smile, like she's seen the light. It's frightening. - I don't remember Helen being quite so insensitive when you were acting odd. - That's not called for. We're all just as worried as you are. - If she's happy, you should be glad. Life hasn't been so easy for Helen. I guess it doesn't bother you knowing you could wake up tomorrow and find that your other leg is gone or your arm or your bladder - Milly! - Or your husband. - Most of them leave, you know. Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot. You don't have m.S. [ Sighs ] Well, let's get on with it. I thought we were in such a rush. - [ Breathing heavily ] I'm sorry I'm late. This arthritis. - Oh, Helen! These are great! - [ Chuckles ] - Mr. Keane, "b." For Mr. Eames' heartfelt efforts, b-plus. And here, at last, the intellectual strainings of our Mr. Edgerton. For Mr. Edgerton, a d-plus and a "see me after class." [ School bell rings ] - Are you satisfied with your grade? - I really worked on this. - For a change. - I deserve better. - I agree. What happened? I had no idea you could write like this. - Why'd you give me such a crummy Mark? - I loved your idea. Everything else was awful. But, David, this shows me that you are capable of achieving a literary career. - I'm glad I'm not even more talented. You'd have given me an "f." - This is an English language class. I don't grade these papers on style. "D" is what you deserve for your grammar and syntax. - All the stuff that doesn't matter. I'm interested in the soul of my work. - That's what the plus which follows your "d" is for. - That's great. Unfortunately, explanations like that are sort of lost on my parents. - Before you can break the rules, young Wordsworth, you must master them. - So I keep hearing. - Correct the areas I've marked. I'll see what I can do about raising the grade. And, David, when you're done, I'd like to have it read for the literary magazine. - You're kidding. - Yes, actually, I am. No, David. I want to submit it. - Far out! - "Far out?" I thought I was teaching you English. - Later, Mr. Bainbridge. - [ Coughs ] - Songbird to penny. Come in, penny. - Hmm? - Where were you, honey? I was talking to you. - Oh, I'm sorry. Must have been daydreaming. - The way you've been sleeping? "Night, bill." Whoosh. Out like a light. - I've been exhausted. Those kids can drive you crazy. - You've only got two to worry about. I've got dozens. You don't hear me complaining. - That's very unfair. My major was history, not home Ec. - I'm sorry, honey. I didn't mean... It's just that you can't give in. You have to stay tough. - I'm tougher than you think. In fact... I want to teach next semester. - That's not a good idea. What would people say? I can support my own family. - It's not about money. - You're not even certified. - I can tutor. I can take on private students. - You have enough to do. You have a home and children. - I can do both. Milly took that job at Wilson's. - You're not Milly. - What's that supposed to mean? I thought I wasn't supposed to feel sorry for myself. Why do you? - Mrs. Kunen. Mr. Bainbridge is giving my story to the literary magazine. - That's great! - Rip. - Rip! - I told you I knew what I was doing. - Well, I see we have a number of interesting subjects today. First, student concern over the advanced level of courses at mount Eden. I've asked James Parker, our senior class president, to present the students' view. [ Cheers and applause ] - Thank you, Dean shays. - Mr. Parker, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't superior academics the very reason for mount Eden's existence? - Of course, Mr. Kunen. We feel perhaps more could be retained if more were comprehended. [ Cheers and applause ] We feel too much of our time goes into memorizing things we're probably gonna forget within 24 hours of any exam. We think if more emphasis were put on understanding the material, we could probably derive even greater benefits from our world-class faculty's knowledge and experience. [ Cheers and applause ] - I think we must be doing something right. - You realize, don't you, that none of this matters. - Helen? - The extent of each student's experience isn't important. They're just elements of the sum total of experience. - I'm afraid I don't quite understand. - Well... The students, like ourselves, are just vehicles. There are millions, billions of vehicles in the world. Telephones and electric lights are vehicles. But neither of them will run without electricity. If the vehicle is in working order, plugging it in will make it run. But if it's worn out... No matter how much electricity you course through it, it won't function. - Psychosomatic. - Well, perhaps I'm a little obtuse, but... I fail to see what this has to do with our subject. - Robert, it's the same with us. We are the electricity that allows our vehicles to run. So, even if your vehicle is better than mine, that doesn't alter the nature of your true existence, which is part of a very large force in which we're all one, in which we all share. And when your vehicle is destroyed, the electricity which you represent returns to all electricity, the same as mine. Is that more clear? - Thank you, Helen. - Helen, what are you talking about? - They know what I mean. - Mrs. Electricity. [ Laughs ] - I'd finally begun to think. The problem was my mind had not yet had a chance to catch up to my experience. - I'm not in the mood to discuss this. - No, I'm serious. What the hell were you trying to say last night? I'm interested. - His wing's getting stronger. We're gonna have to think about letting him go. - Does this have anything to do with the way you've been acting lately? - Just how have I been acting lately? - Come on. You know what I'm talking about. - No, I don't know what you're talking about. Why don't you explain it to me. Just how have I been acting? As far as I'm concerned, I've been acting just fine. - Okay. Forget it. I'm okay, you're okay. Everybody's fine. - Maybe you're not so hot to me. - What are you trying to do? Turn on all the boys? - [ Sighs ] I thought I told you not to put that... - Helen. - No, don't touch me. I'm fine. - Give me your hand. - No, I don't need your help. That's what you keep telling me. - Everybody needs help sometimes. - I rely on your... Give me your hand. - You don't need my help. You need someone who can take care of your house and take care of your kids. Well, I can't. I'm not strong enough. I'm a cripple! - No, you're not a cripple! You could do anything you want to do! - No! You can do anything you want to 'cause you're not the one living in this fucking prison, so fuck you! - Helen! - Fuck you, fuck this house, fuck this body, and fuck this lousy leg! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! [ Sobs ] - It's all right. - Oh, god. Oh, god. [ Crying ] - I spent hours studying other people's out-of-body experiences. I was surprised at how many there were. I tried so hard to understand all this new information that was crashing through my brain, yet none of it was equal to my experience. What book could explain the things I'd seen and lived? Why had I been given this gift? With each journey, I became more and more able to determine their length and direction. But more often than not, I would find myself totally out of control. As if I were floating on a summer sea, as if I were carrying the future and the past. In times like these I never knew where I would go or when I would be back. These were the most marvelous times of all. - They're too mushy! - Yesterday you said they were too hard! - I like it the way mommy does it! - Shh! You'll wake her. - Bill? Bill! It's gone! My leg is better! Bill? - ♪ Well, do you wanna dance - yeah! - Helen, more chips. - ♪ Do you wanna dance - okay. - What are you doing here? - What? - I thought you said you turned over a new leaf, and here I find you shooting craps with the boys. - Helen!

It's a fix! - Out of 25. - Bill, have you seen Helen? We're out of chips again. - I was looking for her, too. Want to take over? - Thought you'd never ask. All right! Pucker up and kiss your money goodbye. - Helen. Hey, honey, I was looking for you. Helen? What are you doing? - Nothing. Just looking at the stars. - Want some company? Some party, huh? Some party. Really turned out great. You did a fabulous job. - Why, thank you, kind sir. [ Chuckles ] What do you suppose we'll find when we travel to the stars? - If we ever travel to the stars. - Oh, we will. - I don't know. I never gave it any thought. - Oh, but you should. You must. Every atom in your body was once inside a star. We're all brothers in that sense. - Funny. You don't look like my brother. [ Chuckles ] I know. Corn ball. - I'm serious. I could take you there. - Listen, Helen. I want to apologize. I've been awfully hard on you. - You don't owe me an apology. - I was just so scared it would keep getting worse. But I knew deep down if I could keep the pressure on you, we'd get through this thing, and we did. 'Cause I know you. I know you can do anything you set your mind to. - Even teach? - What is this thing about teaching? You have a job. - Helen! - Hurry up. - Oh, Helen. Your leg. - They told me about remissions. I guess I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. - My god, I didn't... - I know. Shh. It's okay. It's all right. Let's go. - You are as healthy as an ox. - And as good looking, too? - I'm only a doctor. I'm not qualified to answer that. [ Chuckles ] So... Why don't you tell me what you're really doing here. You're not due for a physical for another four months. - Better safe than sorry, Tom. - And a stitch in time saves nine. [ Sighs ] We could go on like this all day, but I have a waiting room full of phony complaints to deal with before I get back to the hospital. So, uh... Why don't we talk about Helen. - Helen? - Help me out, bill. - Rip. Rip. Rippopoly. Mm. - Since her leg got bad again, she's so detached she could be in another world. She sleeps all the time. - Fatigue is to be expected. - She always had that before and she never gave into it. I wouldn't let her. She's getting very difficult to live with. She's lucky to have someone like you. - Stop, please. - No, I don't mean to embarrass you. I just want to let you know how proud we are. She complained of any changes? Vision? Numbness? - She won't talk about it. - Does she slur her speech? - No. - Loss of bladder control. - Not that I know of. - Any inappropriate emotional outbursts? - Yes. - Is it possible that she's drinking? Or taking drugs? - Drugs? Helen? Yes, Tom. Heroin. She's injecting it. - [ Sighs ] M.s. Is like a sword of Damocles hanging over your head. The uncertainty of not knowing what's going to happen next can make you want to escape. Alcohol is as good a way as any. You know, I think it's Helen I should be seeing. - I've tried. She won't come in. - Insist! - Tom, I don't know if I can do it. I'm 29. I don't think I can change my wife's diapers. You don't know what it's like to watch the person you love fall apart right in front of you. I want to do the right thing. I don't know if I can. I don't know if I'm strong enough. - Go to your rooms. - We didn't do anything! - I don't want you playing with each other. You make too much noise. - Edgerton! You're up! - I was just up two seconds ago. - Well, guess what? You're up again. I love the way you waddle when you run. - When I'm done with this. - Come on! You're up! - All right! - All right, here we go. - Ready? - Move in. - Here it comes. Ooh! - A beauty of a hit! - First! First! Put it into first! - Second! - Get in there! Oh! Oh, great. - There's third. - You're all worthless. - Nice one. Since when do they print comics in hardback? - Ah, it's economics. Shooting for an "a" on the final. Think that might freak out the barbarian? It's actually almost interesting. - Yeah, I'll wait till they make the movie. - Where you headed? - Oh, I got a dentist appointment. - Mm. Lucky bastard. - Yeah, that ain't the scary part. Wait till you hear who's driving me. Ms. Electricity. - Shut up. - In her shiny, new vehicle. - Shut up! - Get over it, man. She's a loon.

I got a "b." - Mr. Kunen helped you? - No. No, you did. - Davey... Do you believe human beings have souls? A soul apart from the body. - Yeah, I guess so. - What do you think about astral projection? I mean, do you believe in it? Or do you think it's just silly? - What's astral projection? - Don't any of you know? Well... Astral projection is what happens to you when you separate your soul from your body. And you let it go places that it couldn't go if it was still in your body. Haven't you ever done that? - Gee, Mrs. Kunen, I don't think so. - Oh. What's happened to you? - It's... it's nothing. - It doesn't look like nothing to me. What did you fight about? A girl? - I'd rather not say. - This is childish. I want you two to shake hands. - No way. - I won't have this. Not in my home. That's better. I won't disturb you any longer. Think hard. Can't you remember ever looking down from above, seeing yourself asleep in bed? - No, ma'am. - Sonny? - No, ma'am. - Rick? - ♪ This old man, he played one ♪ ♪ he played Nick-nack on his thumb ♪ Come on, you guys.

That's what I keep telling everyone. I never felt better. - And you never looked worse. - Thank you. - You're very rundown. - Would you like to try raising two children? It's not so easy for me, you know. - [ Sighs ] I thought you said you never felt better. I want you to check into the hospital for a few days. - What? - Just think of it as a vacation. You're doing too much. - A vacation? What should I do? Bring my bathing suit? - [ Chuckles ] If you like. No, seriously, Helen, I can't tell bill I just told you to take two aspirin and call me in the morning. This is a good idea. It'll give you a chance to rest up while I run a few tests. - I don't know what you're looking for. There's nothing wrong with me we don't already know about. - Come on, Helen. Take a few days off. You deserve it. - Can't I just take 730 aspirin and call you in a year? - [ Chuckles ] Very funny. I think I'll use that. Helen, if you don't do this for yourself, do it for bill and the kids. - [ Scoffs ] No guilt, please. All right. If it'll get everyone off my back. - Attagirl. Go on. Take a lollipop. [ Car door closes ] - Okay, where's the bird? - Aw, dad. Do we have to? - Johnny, we've gone over this 100 times and you know it's right. Everyone has to be free to make their own decisions. Henry's no different. - But we love him and we want to take care of him. - I don't know what you're worried about. He's gonna love this house. - I'll go get him. - No, me! - How'd it go? Helen? [ Bird cawing ] - He likes it! Henry! Come back! [ Bird caws ] - Silly. Stop. I'm all right. Really, I am. Let's go to bed. I can finish this in the morning. Bill? Hold me?

Let's take this off. - Lie down. - [ Sighs ] - Again. I'm so sorry. - It's all right. It's all right. It's not the same, I know. - It's not that at all. - Of course I'm upset. She's been here four days, hasn't slept a wink, and you still haven't the slightest idea of what to do. Where do we go from here? Do we just sit around and watch her waste away? - We're gonna try ACTH injections. Some doctors believe it can lessen the duration of these acute acerbations. - Some doctors? What do you believe? Tom, don't misunderstand, but I think we should be talking to somebody who knows more about this. - Well, unfortunately no one knows very much. - There has to be something. - I've already been in touch with the head of neurology at the university hospital.

Impressive, no? - No. What are you boys doing here? Do you have passes? - Bill, what difference does that make? - Rules are rules. I have to report them. - But... you've done so well with him. Why not give him a little credit for the good things he's doing? - I thought I was doing well, too. But leaving campus without permission, dressed like some kind of beatnik... - Beatnik? - is exactly the kind of behavior I expect from edgerton. - Beats are dead. - Shh. Bill. They did it for me. - Well, I suppose I could close my eyes this one time. - Mm. [ Sighs ] - I hope you don't think that's funny. - [ Scoffs ] What a dip. - What'd you say? This is disgusting! Those men are dying for our country. - Yeah, that's what's disgusting. - Okay, all bets are off. I don't believe what I almost let you talk me into. You're on report. - I don't believe you'd do this. He'll be expelled. - He'll just be put on disciplinary. If he passes all his finals, he'll be fine. - Bill, I think... - Helen, please stay out of this. You're here to get better. That's what I want you concentrating on. - It's okay Mrs. Kunen. We pretty much figured we'd get reported anyway. Who gives a shit? It was worth it. - How dare you use that language. This is my wife. - Don't get your bowels in an uproar. - You're in big trouble, mister. - Groovy. I'm used to it. - Bill, stop this, please. - Wait outside. I'm driving you back to Eden. Go. - Nice move. So long, Mrs. K. Get better. And remember... Rip. - [ Chuckles ] [ Gasps ] - Jesus. - You can kiss cross country goodbye. - This is all your fault. - What? - This is 1965. We don't keep our women in shackles anymore. - What the hell are you talking about? - Slavery is illegal. And it's out of date. - You're pressing your luck. - You know, you don't even understand her. You know, that's why she has to get away. To me, she's the most beautiful woman in the world. To you she's just a cripple. - Mr. Kunen! - ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh - you ought to read this. Maybe you'll astral project to another school and we'll finally be rid of you. - I'd do it, but you'd be so lonely. - Hey, this tastes pretty good. Your ol' dad's getting better at this, isn't he? - [ Chuckles ] - Well, I for one think it's a cheap trick. - So do I. - What an easy way to get a little attention. - You know, Lee and I wanted to go to the island this summer, but this is a lot closer. Wonder if they have any rooms left for June. - I booked them all. - [ Chuckles ] - I need my privacy. - Well... We should get going. You look like you could use a little sleep. - She's right. Another couple of days' rest and you'll be as good as new. - I am very tired. - You just rest up. Don't worry about a thing. [ Guitar strumming ] [ Telephone rings ] - Hello? - We put her on intravenous at 6:00. She fell right asleep. After about five hours, the nurse went to check up on her, tried to wake her up, no response. - Stop. Enough. - I'd been gone 12 hours when I finally realized I didn't have to return. My body was now totally cared for. I could finally divorce myself from the physical. Now I saw everything. Animals, plants, their organs, their blood. I became part of the earth, part of its core, and grew with it outward to its furthest reaches. I saw the earth knows its parts as we know our skin and veins. I saw the earth lives and breathes and all on it share each breath. It was four days before I thought to return. I watched bill as he sat by my body. When I saw how hurt he was, my heart broke. I thought he'd be glad I was gone. [ Faintly ] Bill. - Helen? Oh, Helen, thank god. - Billy, I'm fine. - Oh, Helen. Hey. - You don't have to worry about me anymore. You're free now. - No, I don't want to be free. - I'm seeing. I'm learning. It's good. I'm part of life. - Hey. Helen. Helen? No. Help! Somebody! Help! - Rummy? - Nickle a point. - You think I ought to talk to the barbarian? Tell him about all this cosmic consciousness stuff? - What, are you crazy? - I don't know. Maybe it'll give him some idea what's wrong with her? - Dave, come on. It's just a load of crap. - I believe it. - Get real. - So, it doesn't look like mommy's gonna be able to come home right away after all. - What's the matter with her? - Well, baby... Mommy's in what they call a coma. - What's a coma? - It's when a person falls asleep and doesn't wake up for a long time. - She's dead. - No, son. She's not dead. She's just asleep. - Like sleeping beauty? Right, daddy? - Yes, baby. Like sleeping beauty. - I'll ask gabey to protect her. - He's not an angel. He's just a doll! - Gabey! - Guys. Hey, stop that. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Stop! Stop! - Gabey! - Hey! I hope you're ready for a spanking. [ Knock on door ] [ Door opens ] You're so young. You have your whole life ahead of you. Don't waste your time worrying about us. We'll be all right. - Aren't you even gonna read it? - It's not necessary. My wife is going through a very difficult time. It's easy to understand why she believes something like that. - At last take a look. Don't you owe her that much? - Don't you think I already have? Mrs. Kunen's problem is a medical one. The solution to it isn't in this book. This is just a lot of nonsense. - No. No, it may be nonsense to you, but it's not to her. It's real. I know it is. - This is about the stupidest thing I've ever seen. - Shh. [ Sitar music plays ] [ Girls laugh ] - Jesus Christ. - All right! Here we go. - [ Humming ] Take a seat, ladies. Take a seat. - What are you doing here? You're gonna blow the whole thing. - We are not. We just want to watch. - Once you go black, you never come back. - [ Laughs ] - Quiet. I have to concentrate. - Is that what I think it is? - Where'd you get that? - Have a nice flight, Davey. - I don't believe this. - Don't Bogart that joint. - [ Laughs ] - [ Coughs ] - [ Sighs ] Rip. Like in "rip off." - What's the matter? - Okay, Mrs. Kunen. If you're anywhere around, you're gonna have to leave. 'Cause I'm about to stick my hand in Dithy's blouse. - You are not! [ Laughs ] - Can't anybody figure out what's wrong? - No, they keep running all these tests, but... - It's freaky. I mean... You don't suppose she'll die or anything, do you? - I don't know, you know? I really love her, you know? Everything I did I did because of her. And now she's just deserting me. - You're wrong. She's not deserting you. - She said you have to stick it out, you know? And I believed her. And what do I care about economics? It's just a load of bullshit. I'm not even worried about it anymore. [ Bell dings ] - During the next two months, I saw more and more. With each thing I learned, 1,000 doors opened. I saw my being was made of a million elements and I was one of billions that made the earth. And the earth was one of an infinite number that made the universe. My body became weaker, and I wasn't sure what to expect if I were to die. The end of the last of the last barrier between myself and complete understanding? I burned with anticipation and excitement. And fear. - Edgerton. Get a haircut. - All right. We have to get back from dinner. Hey. Aren't you gonna kiss your mother? - Daddy, I don't want to come here anymore. - You know... I pretended that the changes you were going through didn't matter to me. I was fooling myself. They did. But they don't anymore. Dave edgerton says your spirit is off traveling somewhere. I don't believe that. But maybe you do. If that's what this is all about... Helen, come back. I'll take care of you. Just as you are. I told you I'd never leave you. And I won't. I know you're alive, and you're in there, and you're gonna come back. - [ Laughs ] - All right, Mrs. Kunen. I can't believe she made this. - Hmm. - [ Chuckles ] - "No interrupting in class. Move a space ahead." [ Both laugh ] "Failed semifinals. Skip a turn." - Sounds good. "Tardy to class"... that's my favorite right there already. - D-u-m-m dumb. - Look at these pieces. - Hey, you made honor roll. - Oh, yeah, right. - Well? - We're doing everything we can. Keeping her as comfortable as possible. - That's good. - Bill, I want to be honest with you. There isn't much chance that she's ever gonna recover. - But she might. - I just don't want to give you any false hope. - You said m.S. Isn't life-threatening. - It's not supposed to be. - What do we do now? - I want to wean her off the respirator. - I can't do that. She'll die. - No, no. Many people in comas, they live without artificial support. She may become so dependent on it that it's self-perpetuating. - She'll die and you know it. I don't want to hear this. - We would not stop feeding her, just the respirator. - I think you lost your senses. You should have your license taken away. - Bill, I know how you feel. Believe me. Nobody sympathizes with you more. - You sympathize with total fucking bullshit! They'll arrest you for murder and they'll put you in jail. - I have known Helen since she was born. Now, there's a slight chance, but it's worth taking. She's already as good as dead. - I'll keep her hooked up to anything I can get my hands on. I'll come every day. I'll talk to her. I'll hold her hand. She needs me. I need her. I'm getting another doctor. I don't want you going anywhere near her. - [ Coughs ] Thomas Malthus was an 18th-century economist. He hypothesized that mankind's reproductive urge would push it to the edge of existence and a losing battle between... Uh, its insatiable appetite and nature's ability to, uh, support it. - Do you actually commit these passages to memory or is this photographic repetition a natural gift? - [ Sighs ] - Is there anyone who actually understands the material? And would care to comment? Edgerton. My new star pupil. What did Malthus feel kept this discrepancy between mouths and food in check? Or did he simply believe we were all doomed. Edgerton. - Uh... Malthus said that's why war, poverty, and disease exist. They're a natural phenomenon. And they keep the population in check. - Excellent. So... Seems there's a natural harvesting of human beings which takes place. Same way we thin the ranks of seals, elephants, trees. Survival of the fittest. I would suggest you know this survival of the fittest theory well. It will figure strongly on Monday's final. - [ Clears throat ] - Tag! You're it! - You're it! - You stop that! [ Indistinct conversations ] - Really having fun, huh? It's funny. Ever since Henry flew away, Amy swore she'd never play again. - I'm proud of what you've done. From flunking out to straight "b" s. You make me realize it's worthwhile. I did a good job on you. - I can't believe you're always trying to take credit. When are you gonna wake up? All you ever did was push me farther away. Mrs. Kunen is the one that helped. At least she tried to make me understand. Why don't you let her go? - What kind of man do you think I am? I'd never leave her. - Oh, you're so tough. I didn't say leave her. I said let her go. Isn't there anything that you learned from her? - I began to die. It was strange to feel the energy outside my body become independent, as the small amount left inside joined my spirit. But no matter how hard I tried, a thin veil remained between myself and the infinite. I pushed harder and harder. But as my body grew weaker, i, too, grew weaker, and I was scared. Could I have learned all that I learned for it to come back to the same ageless question? Why? How? If there is a god and he caused it all to exist, then where did he come from? There are four billion suns in our galaxy. But how many galaxies are there? What if the spirit I'd become simply ceased to exist when my body finally died? Life is there. In the physical. I must go back. I have to go back. No. Look at it lying there. This body is already destroyed. There's nothing left for me to offer my children or bill. Or anyone. And when it dies, I'll be released. Released to be one with the universe. Released to finish my quest. [ Door opens ] - Martin Luther King. - [ Laughs ] Wrong, bean brain. Martin Luther King marched on Washington. And Martin Luther was condemned by the diet of worms. [ Laughs ] - Martin Luther, Martin Luther King... You know what I meant. - [ Laughs ] - Edgerton. - All right, you have exactly one hour starting now. All right. Time's up. Bring your exam books to the front of the room. [ School bell rings ] [ Students cheer ] [ Sighs ] Thought you might like to know how you did. - Already? - Wouldn't want to torture you any more than necessary. - Sure you would. - C-plus! All right! - Let's see what we can do about turning that into a "b" next year, huh? - Where's edgerton? - I don't know. - Well, tell him I'm sorry. This isn't the way I wanted it, but, uh... He left me no choice. - "F." - Hi. - Hi. I don't know whether you can hear me or not, but I want you to know I'll never forget you. If you go, I'll think about you every minute of every day I'm alive. And can you ever forgive me? I thought if I could accept your body, that would be enough. But I forgot to accept you. You said our bodies are vehicles and I refused to understand. Now I do. 'Cause it's you I miss, not your body. When I tried to help, I thought that the answer was to stay tough. I was wrong. 'Cause it's your tenderness that's changing Dave. And your tenderness that's changing me. We need you so much, especially Johnny. But this isn't about us. If I were in your place... I'd choose the same freedom you have. I only hope that you find out there the same love that will always live for you here. [ Door opens ] [ Sighs ] What are you doing here? - I just came to say goodbye. I didn't think you'd be here. Sorry. - Wait. I was looking for you. - Yeah. I got the message loud and clear. You don't have to worry. I won't be back. - From now on we'll learn together. Wait downstairs? I'll drive you home? [ Ventilator hisses ] You're free now. I'm releasing you. Do what you have to. Our love is forever. - [ Sniffles ] Give me the police department, please. - Thanks, Milly. I'll have their things ready. Um... i don't know. Maybe a few days. Maybe longer. Okay. [ Plate shatters ] I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not mad. From now on, we have to do everything for each other. We have to live for each other. Do you understand? Hey. Your mother wants us to love each other. 'Cause that's the most important thing, and because she loves us very much. - I made my bed this morning. - I know. I love you, son. - Bill... This is very embarrassing. I have to ask you to come with me. - I know. - Is there anyone who can watch the kids? - Milly Johnson is on her way over. - No! - John. - You won't come back! - It's all right, okay? I'll be back home soon. - No! You'll never come back! - Yes, I will. I'll be back soon. - No! [ Telephone rings ] - Hello? Who is it? Daddy! It's Dr. Bryson! - Yes, Tom. What is it? Johnny, stop. Mommy's back. Hey. Johnny. Mommy's back. - With his love, bill gave me the choice, and finally I knew my path was life. I came back. Back to my family. Back to Eden.
