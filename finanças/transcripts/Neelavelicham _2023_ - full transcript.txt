Vaikom Muhammad Basheer's 'NEELAVELICHAM' (The blue radiance) Stop. This is the house. Salaam! -Fine. -Paste a 5-paise stamp over here. Alright. Good that I met you here. I was about to go to the post office. I just moved in here. I have heard a lot about you. Glad to meet you. -Sir, your address... -It's nearby. The two-storey mansion on the right side, a little further from here. -Okay, sir. -Okay. A strong tea. Greetings, sir. I have rented a house nearby. I need meals regularly for lunch and supper. It would be delightful if you could deliver it there. Of course, sir. Keep this as an advance amount. Narayana, my Lord! Tea... Sir, ask him where does he live. Haa. Sir, which is the house? When you go straight from here, the vacant mansion on the right... "Bhargavi Nilayam." Um.. yes... the lunch box! Sir... Our lunch box is broken. Oh! Then, a packed meal would do. But... No problem. I will come here to eat. There is no one here. Better leave soon. Uncle, leave him be. He's our man. Come, come. Come in. I thought... it was the landlord coming for the rent. Sit, sit. Ramdas, make it five glasses of tea! Who is it, Noolan? Not the one we thought. Come and take a look. It's said first things first, right? So, you must give the newspapers and magazines to us to read first. Why not?! Aha! You?! When did you come? It's been two days since I reached the home town. And came here today. But you did not come this way! I was in search for the house. -Podiyan! -Yes? -Come here! -Tea. -Ha! When did you come? Just now. Him...? He is my own uncle. Madhavan Nair. A single piece! We have kept him here to intimidate the landlord when he comes asking for rent! Anyway, the thing which you couldn't do in two months... I managed within two days. -I found the house. -Wow! A couple of rooms are still lying vacant! Podiyan, come along. Eveready! Is it the house by the beach? No. It's by the road itself. But there are no vacant houses by the road. There is a house! This morning, I shifted my belongings there. A house around here that we don't know of?! O God... Is it Bhargavi Nilayam? Is it Bhargavi Nilayam?! Yes. What is wrong?! It is a house where a dreadful unnatural death happened. That mansion was shut for a very long time. The only thing there now is a bloodthirsty ghost! Ghost? Whose ghost? The darling daughter of that house! Then? Then what? She killed herself jumping into that well! Why? Love failure! Oh... The mighty Bhargavi! A mesmeric beauty! She was very good at singing and dancing! She was my classmate. Who was the lover? One Mr Sasikumar. He left. Don't know where he is now. He lived right next to Bhargavi Nilayam. They were in a platonic love! After a while, as their love bloomed, on a fine beautiful day, Sasikumar fled the town. And Bhargavi jumped into the well and died. A letter was found by the well, of Sasikumar's. Saying he married someone else. She hates men ever since. People are scared to go to that compound even during the day. Okay, then. Good night. I am warning you again. Do not go there. Stay here. Do not worry. A lover would understand me. Nothing will happen to me. Bhargavikutty... We are not acquainted yet. I am a humble writer. A lone traveller. I am the new tenant here. I threw the stone in the morning without knowing a thing. Don't be angry at me. Who is that? Eh?! Sorry. I heard varied stories today. Bhargavikutty, please listen carefully... I paid all the money I had as two months' rent. In this colossal world, I have no other place to go or a person. Goodbye, rodent! Goodbye. May I enter the house? Paul Robeson. Pandit Ravi Shankar. Mohammed Rafi. Ha! Let's start with Pankaj Mullick. [Humming 'Tu Dar Na Zara Bhi by Pankaj Mullick] [Zulm Ki Zanjeer Se Jakde Huye Qaidi by Pankaj Mullick] Actually, why did you kill yourself? Bhargavikutti... If you had lived a lot longer, hugging you tightly... and giving thousands of kisses, there would have been someone to love you in abundance. [Guzar Gaya Woh Zamaana by Pankaj Mullick] 'A Lover's Diary' "In every heart is a tomb of love" "In every heart is a graveyard of love" Good night, Bhargavikutty. Good night. "These are memories. My memories of Saraswati Devi." "That is this Lover's Diary." Good morning, Bhargavikutty. What happened last night at Bhargavi Nilayam, sir? What to happen? I had a pleasant sleep. [Guzar Gaya Woh Zamaana by Pankaj Mullick] Last year, M.N. sir's sister and her husband went to stay there and they couldn't even live through a single night. Who is this M.N. sir? We could say M.N. sir is kind of a lord around here. This girl, Bhargavi... I mean, that demon in that house now. M.N. sir is her uncle's son. Their families had thought of marrying Bhargavi to M.N. sir. That is when, she fell in love with some random singer. I see. So, that is how the story goes... Story?! So, are you going to write a story about Bhargavi, sir? But I know nothing significant. M.N. sir says that she was a wicked girl. Anyway, you should be careful, sir. Several millions have died on this earth. Sir... This was an unnatural death. Bhargavi Nilayam is a cursed place. Many of her things are still there in a room. At night, she would turn into a rodent, a dog, or a cat! Hey, did you forget about hearing the song? For about half an hour, after the lamps went off. Something must have happened after that. For sure. We should not have let him go there. Just because of a love failure, did anyone expect that one would lose his ability to think? Love? Him?! Yes. What is the point, anyway? We were about to come there, weren't we? What happened last night? Nothing happened. But... did you see anything? -Yes. -Hmm? A dog and a rodent. There is no problem there, you goofs! You come stay there. I will have some company. Oh, no... count us out. You come stay with us. Do not stay in that daunting house. Where is your uncle, Noolan? He is at the lodge. You do not worry. I am very much at ease there. Shall I leave? Bhargavikutty. I was thinking, what if I write your story? Not those false tales people tell. Your true story. What do you say? Sasikumar, in the house across the wall... here, in this house... Bhargavikutty. Between the two hearts, a mere wall! Who is there? Oh! Alright! Where is the key to your life? Huh? "Oh, the anonymous friend passing across this way..." "If you can sing..." "with the soothness of a melody..." "ease my heart's pain a little." "Lull me to sleep..." "with sweet mellow music of rapturous life." "Lull me to sleep..." Is this you, Bhargavikutty? It must be you. I want to burst into a song, as loudly as I can. But all my efforts end up as mere whispers of sorrow. Let go of me! Who are you? I am a passer-by, sir. I came here looking for a job. This is quite a disgrace, sir. I was pushed down to the floor when I entered... Madam, your wife, strangled me too. -Madam? -Yes. Oh! When you come into a house in the dark, you should call either 'sir', or 'madam'-- When I came in, Madam was sitting on the veranda like a lit sparkler, sir! What is your name? Parikanni Junior. -Parikanni 'Junior'? -Yes. So, there has to be a 'Senior' one as well... Parikanni 'Senior'? Do you know him, sir? There are hardly any who doesn't know Parikanni Sr. Sir, look.. this... this huge. He will roast a huge goat and eat it in one go! And will drink two pots of fine toddy too... Who is this Parikanni Sr. to you? He's my father, sir. O Lord... Bhargavikutty... let this Parikanni Jr. stay here. He is a simple fellow. Shall redo this courtyard and the well. Let's make a garden as well. Forgive me, madam. It was unintentional. Carry on sleeping. Sir! Madam! Help! Uh-oh! Come quick, sir! What's there? Eh?! A giant! Giant?! No, sir. Don't step out! He said he would kill me when I screamed! Come inside, sir. Do not keep the gate open. Okay. I will buy the supper and come. You do not try going out again today. Oh.. no.. no... Meow! Madam! Bhargavi madam! Can you please call this cat inside? Eh? Thank you, madam! Thank you! I got scared... that's why. Got scared... Sir... Sir... Noolan, your turn Let go of me! Let go! I told you to stay away from here, did I not? -Oh, no! -Let go of him, uncle! Oh, lord mother! Who are you? Who are you? What do you want? Oh, God! -I am here to take the rope. -Rope? What rope? Here. I was asked to give this here. "Dear Comrades," "The one who is coming there is my roommate," "Parikanni Jr, the great." O, great souls, please be kind and don't scare him with stories. "He is all I have got to talk to." "We have plans to repair the well." "Please send a rope with him." "Lovingly, the new Sultan of Bhargavi Nilayam." You should get down. I will hold the rope. -Who? Me?! -Yes. I am scared! I will get dizzy and fall, sir. You and your fears! It is true, sir. I get scared even looking into that. I will get dizzy... I'll fall. That is why. No problem. I will get down, then. You must hold it tight. Parikanni will hold it tight, no matter if it is an elephant or a man. -And, sir. -Yes? Didn't I tell you about a giant attacking me the other day? -Actually, do you know who he is? -Who? You know Noolan sir, don't you? It's his uncle. When I went to the lodge today, he squeezed my neck and hand! Oh. I see. Sir, be careful. Lower a bit, Parikanni. Is this enough? A bit more. Yes. Enough. Stop. Sir! Oh, God! Sir! Sir! Sir! Sir! Madam! Sir fell into the well! Oh, God! Sir! God! Help... Sir! Sir! Oh, God! Good lord! My sir fell into the well and died! What?! Fell into the well and died?! Yes! He climbed down the well on a rope to clean it. The rope broke, he fell into the well, and drowned. Good lord! I had warned him not to stay in that house. He was such a simple soul. When he fell into the well, I heard bangles clink. But I did not see madam. I tried calling her many times. Madam? Which madam? Bhargavi madam. Sir's wife. Did you see her? Of course, I did. I saw her sitting in the dark like a lit sparkler. What else did you see there? Besides that... I heard harmonium from madam's room. Also, heard the jingling of the anklets when she danced. -She is not your sir's wife! -Who is she, then? The ghost of Bhargavi, who jumped into that well and died! Ghos...! Oh, no! Parikanni. Hey, Parikanni! Oh, God! Sir's ghost! You, absolute stupid! I am not a ghost! -You are not? -Nothing happened to me. What really happened? This great man let go of the rope! I fell straight into the well upside down! I do not remember anything vividly. It was about... twelve feet deep... Yes. After that, I am slowly rising from the water. As if somebody was lifting me up. My head reached the surface, and I took a breath. Until then, not a drop of water went in my mouth! Suddenly, I saw the rope and clung onto it. Then... all I remember is me outside the well. Come on, let us go. I am not coming, sir. I am scared! I am not coming there, sir. I'm really scared, sir. Bhargavikutty... Once again we are left all alone... Just you and me!

"Lucknow" "In the second-class compartment of the express train," "an unidentified body was found." "The body found is of a man presumably 35 years old." "It is assumed to be two days old." "In the shirt pocket of the corpse, wrapped in newspaper" "a strand of curly hair was found" "that is suspected to be of a woman." "As the script of the paper was Malayalam" "the investigating officers suspect that he is a Malayali." "The primary conclusion is that this is a suicide due to love failure." Bhargavikutty... How is this news connected to you? "Bhargavi," "What do you find lacking in my love?" "Don't I love you more than anything else in this world?" "I cannot even imagine you living with anyone but me." "I will go to any extent, to avoid such situations." "Keep that in mind." "Your Nanukuttan." Nanukuttan was an unruly man. A lunatic. Extremely obsessive. Black magic, spellcasting, exorcism, he was a firm believer of such practices. And? Don't you want to know anything about Bhargavi? She had two friends. Suma and Latha. Here, these are Bhargavi and Sasikumar. Quite a sensible young man. That is my memory of him. She scratched on the photo. Do you want me to worship that evil man? Bhargavi was such a nice girl. She loved him as if he meant the world to her. She worshipped him. Alas! That wicked man left, shattering her into pieces! Mr Kuthiravattam I need to talk to you as well. When will be convenient for you to visit Bhargavi Nilayam? I'll come till that gate, sir. I can't step in. Mother, at the time of Bhargavikutty's death, did you get a letter from the wellside? Yes, I did. It did mention that Sasikumar married someone else, didn't it? There was something of that kind. The incident of you finding that letter at the wellside, can you please recollect it? Did you find it on the night when Bhargavikutty died? On the next day after she went missing. Pappu found it. I would like to see that letter. Well... Nanukuttan took it from me that very day. Oh. Do you want to hear something? Once, this Nanukuttan made nine kittens stand in a line on a wall. He shot them to death, one by one. Bhargavikutty, how many times have you kissed this? How many times, you must have held it close to your heart! No, sir. I have not seen this before. Where did you get this from, sir? And, sir... Did you finish writing Bhargavi's story? It is about to be finished. It is not suicide, as we thought. Bhargavikutty. The kerosene is over. Let me go and arrange some kerosene. The story is almost complete. I will read it to you once I am back. -Noolan, your turn. -Yes. -How do you do, Parikanni? All good? -Good, sir. You came at the right moment! We needed one more person to play cards. -Parikanni doesn't know how to play! -I do not know! I need some kerosene, friends. Couldn't you have asked 'Bhargavi?' Let me get it, sir. Come, sit. Let us play one round. No! A heavy storm is coming. You can go once that is over. I need to go. As I was about to finish the story, the oil in the lamp got over. So, I need to go back. You should give us the story to read, okay? Readers may read it once published! Oh! Here, sir. Good night, then. Good night. Sir... May God bless you, sir. May God bless us all! Bhargavikutty. Thank you for this blue radiance. I shall finish this quickly and read it out for you. A moonrise. Not yesterday's or not tomorrow's. Transcending times and ages, amalgamating into the infinite yester-eons, passing numerous births and deaths, tears and smiles, passing the blaring roars of the clouds and fierce glints of lightning, passing deluges and heavy storms, passing several cursed and graced days and nights, as serenely alluring as ever, as an absolute circle of whitey dust, thus arise, a full moon! -Let's go? -Okay. Would he help us for a trivial college function? Not just 'he.' The honourable 'Him!' Would the 'Honourable Him' help us? Eh? We could ask. We shall prepare the dance and song. I am more than happy to. When is the youth festival? It is not a youth festival, it is our college anniversary. I sometimes hear you dancing, from your home. I, too, hear songs from here. Do you sing, Bhargavi? Bhargavi does sing, but for the time being, I shall sing this song. ♪ Sipping the delightful grail of love, unwittingly ♪ ♪ I am a springtime butterfly ♪ ♪ I am a springtime butterfly ♪ ♪ My heart fell in love with the gleaming flame of allure ♪ ♪ I am a springtime butterfly ♪ ♪ Sipping the delightful grail of love unwittingly ♪ ♪ I am a springtime butterfly ♪ ♪ I am a springtime butterfly ♪ ♪ Even when my life torments on the cluster of fire ♪ ♪ I am here to caper ♪ ♪ Even when my dreams wilt and wither ♪ ♪ I will embrace a smile ♪ ♪ Sipping the delightful grail of love unwittingly ♪ ♪ I am a springtime butterfly ♪ ♪ I am a springtime butterfly ♪ ♪ Even if my wings burn or I myself burn on a pyre ♪ ♪ I will not part ways with the light of my life ♪ ♪ I will not part ways with the light of my life ♪ ♪ I will not part ways with the light of my life ♪ ♪ Sipping the delightful grail of love unwittingly ♪ ♪ I am a springtime butterfly ♪ ♪ I am a springtime butterfly ♪ ♪ I am a springtime butterfly ♪ ♪ I am a springtime butterfly ♪ ♪ I am a springtime butterfly ♪ What's with you when you see Bhargavi?

And, Bhargavi! She looked like a celestial beauty! The onlookers couldn't have taken their eyes off her! Many must have cast an evil eye on her! Let me ward it off! Wait! You can do that later. Finish that first. Where did Pappu go? My wife and I are meeting for the first time. A glance. Two smiles. Jumbrikko!!! The world was not the same anymore, sir! A whole new world! Wow! Finally, the holy doors have opened! Can we eat something at least now? Relax a bit, Latha. I will serve you in a moment. -Come, Pappu. -Okay. How are things here, mother? They are starving. Me, too. Me, too. Yeah! Me, too! Just go sit there and have food. Take those plates. Have it. But there are two more months. -Oops! No! -Oh, no! It is bleeding. We could not prepare much, son. We will make up for it next time, okay? This itself is so overwhelming, mother! As I eat the same food from the restaurant everyday, even the word 'homely food' makes me crave these days! Did you hear? Son, I have to chase after her, to make her eat something. The value of food will only be known when it is not available. Let us go. May I take leave then? Alright. Paru! Do not forget to soak up the rice for tomorrow. The new play is ready! Paru alias the tower of paradise! Really? Get me the rice now, and you may build the tower later! Does the wound on your finger hurt? The finger's pain is gone. But you did not ask about the pain of my heart. What happened to your heart? Nobody loves me. Nobody should love you! I do not like that. What? I do not like anybody loving you, Bhargavi! But I need love. What? You mean I should love you, Bhargavi? Yes. Else, I will perish! I love you, Bhargavi.

You will have to let go of these fortunes to come into my pale life. Your life is not pale. It is pristine white! Like moonlight! Madam... Bhargavi madam... Despite having all these clothes, why do you wear only white nowadays? Why? Isn't white a lovely colour? What will you do with all these clothes, then? Hello, Mr. Sasikumar. Hello. Please come. Please sit. I am Narayanan. Bhargavi is my cousin. -I have seen you around. -Yes. You were at the college too, the other day, right? The song and dance were exemplary! Been thinking of visiting you for a while. But never had time! I get busy with yielding coconuts from all our groves. Also, visit the paddy field, if not that, the estate! Bungidi sangidi bungo! [gibberish] Sir! Fruits sent by Bhargavi! Chaing! Chaing! Chaing!-- Chaing! Your play's name is nice. "Fruits sent by Bhargavi!" How is your disciple? I have several students around the village. If it is about Bhargavi, I am not tutoring her much these days. Your expenses? Are your earnings enough for that? Yes, I somehow get by. Get by! You have these many furniture? Oh, no. These are rented ones. All I own is that Sitar. Veena? Sitar. Veena? Sitar. And in my home, lots of rooms are simply left vacant! You may come and stay there! Thanks a lot for the offer. I shall stay here itself. I liked this place quite well. Yeah. I can see that. I shall get going, then. May your writing go really well. See you. See you. How can that be, Nanukuttan? Aunt, we load propellant chargers instead of bullets in the gun. It will spread like an umbrella and fall on many. Hey, go freshen up and have tea. Don't close yourself inside the room just like that. -So, you caught that cuckoo? -No! I could not catch that cuckoo. I was talking about the stork. I will catch it one day! Aunt, I have decided to get married. Wow. That is good. You need to fix the date and time. Have you started meeting prospective brides? Well, there is no need for that. She's my childhood friend. Very good at dancing and singing. A nice girl! Well... She is... your daughter! Bhargavi! My bride-by-law! But isn't she still studying, Nanukuttan? Her studies will be over soon, won't they? Yes... Anyway, let me discuss this with her. Okay? -Hey, Pappu! -Yes? How is your play going? I have one! Madam... Chaing! The curtain is rising. Our hero gets into Ouseph's rickshaw. Ouseph sprints with the rickshaw. As they cross a turn, they see our heroine fleeing with the villain on a cycle! -With the villain? -Yes. Heroine? He got it! That is the name of my latest play, sir. 'The heroine who eloped with the villain.' Heroine eloping with the villain?! Yes, sir! Much appreciated, sir! Will any heroine elope with the bloody villain?! Oh, no! Pappu! We do not have him here for the passers-by to hit him! I am not a passer-by! Be it the uninvited too. Watch your words! You are my wife-to-be. I have no interest in being Mr. Narayanan's wife. -Look for someone else... -Shucks! Do not fight over this. Why did you hit Pappu? You come, Pappu. A marriage proposal?! Yes. From a relative. My mother said we could see to it once my studies are over. Yes. So that is all about it. Such things should be planned only after the studies, right? Yes. For the time being, let us focus on this speech! Otherwise, let us do one thing. Go home and memorise this speech well. I have to meet a friend. I will come only after that. Things went wrong yesterday. I do not know what all blunders I made! I came here to apologise to Bhargavi. Hasn't she come back from college yet? She will return only after going to the library. It will be past dusk. [Nanukuttan's letter to Bhargavi] The police arrested Balan and Raghavan from their homes. Many ran off that day. We have no information about their whereabouts now. I feel so fortunate that I found you. We have not done anything seditious, Ravi ettan. Our protests were peaceful. Anyway, I am not ready to surrender. I want to live my life. For the time being, you are safe here. You can survive here for some more time. Shall I get going then? I need to catch the night train. Okay. S.K... Be careful. You too. Wherever you go, I will come with you. It is not like that. I am planning to go to Lucknow. I will know the situation only once I reach there. I will return after six months. I will return to take you with me, Bhargavi. Let us go. Hello! Here! Ah! Sorry, Mr Narayanan. I couldn't say goodbye to you in person. So what? I am here now! I have a ticket too! I am going to Delhi. For a job interview. I am not sure if I will get it. But I can still try. A classmate of mine was supposed to come. But a sudden death in his family. Oh. Bhargavi sent this for you. Do I have to tell you more? 'B' for... Let us go. Thanks a lot. Can you please give me some water? I feel very uneasy. Do you really need water now? Lie down well. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. No, dear. No letters for you today as well.. You do not need to come here every day, dear. If anything comes, I shall deliver it to your home.

No need to die, Bhargavi! Nobody is here. They will come only tomorrow morning. I am here to see you, Bhargavi. I already told you whatever I have to say. I do not want to hear anything more. Hear this too, Bhargavi. The train ticket to Lucknow was on me. I gave him some bananas to eat. I had poisoned them. When I told him that you sent it over, the poor guy believed it. Which means your singer will never return. I've killed him. You may think, I won the battle between him and me! He will never return now. You may spend the rest of your life with me, Bhargavi. Let go of me! Let go! Then die, Bhargavi! Bhargavikutty. Is the whole story correct? Shouldn't I be the one to answer it? Huh? Hello, Mr M. N. When did you realise... that I killed them, Mr Writer? It was a guess based on my reckonings. At first, I mistook my friend's uncle as the culprit. Later on, I assumed certain things from Mr M.P. Kuthiravattam's words. Here and there, some errors are present. Yet... your work is commendable. You are quite something! Marvellous! Which part of the story has errors? I could correct them and get it published. But you are not going to live much longer, Mister. By morning, about 30 lorries of sand will reach here to fill this well. Before that, I will cut you, the Writer in 3 pieces and throw you into it. Followed by your trunk, bed, this lamp... I will demolish this house then! If this story is your problem, you may take it. "A moonrise" This is not my problem. But... the brain that wrote this! You have committed two heinous murders. Now you say that you will kill me too! No matter who you kill, it is not easy to get the girl you love. You know, right? Even then, I am the villain of this story! A murderer! A criminal! Hello, Mister! I am the hero of this story! The hero of this love story! Do you have any last wish? I do not have any. Then, your story ends here. Let me come to the errors in the story now. Unlike you guessed, I did not get down at that station after passing him the bananas. I got down at the next station only. Sasikumar did not die immediately. I choked him to death! Then Bhargavi. She said, she will avenge even if she dies! You skipped that part somehow. To hell with her avenge! So, your time ends here! I have no grudge against you. But I have no other choice, but killing you! M.N! M.N! Nanukuttan! Hold onto the rope and climb up! Nanukuttan! Nanukuttan! Nanukuttan! Nanukuttan! Bhargavikutty, May your soul rest in peace. May you and Sasikumar unitie on the other side. My beloved friend... From the reality of you and me, I am going to be the only one to remain. Only me...
