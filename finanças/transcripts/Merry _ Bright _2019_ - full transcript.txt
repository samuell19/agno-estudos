[upbeat music] - Legend has it that the very first candy cane was created one Christmas by a choir master to help keep the children occupied during Christmas mass. The choir master curved the candy into a hook, which was meant to represent the handle of the staff of the shepherd. My grandma Carol loved that story, and it inspired her to make the greatest candy canes in the world. [upbeat music] I can't believe the board is doing this to me. Empire Corporate Recovery from New York? - Apparently they're quite good. - It's just another cost we don't need. - The board is probably just concerned about the future of the company. - But I'm the new CEO. I'm concerned with the future of the company. I know Merry & Bright hasn't turned a profit these last couple years but I am really... I'm venting aren't I? Am I venting? - A smidge. - Okay. - Uh, mini candy cane? - Yes. Thank you. You know let's, let's just talk about something else. How are things with you and Pete? - He keeps dropping hints that something big is in the works. - Hints? - You know. - Sophie! - Okay, not hints. It's more of a feeling. I mean, we've been together for three years and Christmas is the perfect time to get engaged. Oh, Cate I'm, I'm sorry, I forgot. - Don't worry, that's ancient history. I'm happy for you. This calls for a toast. [gentle music] Try the mint deluxe. Cheers [chuckles]. [upbeat music] - A candy cane company? You want me to do corporate recovery for a candy cane company? - The Merry & Bright Candy Cane Company to be specific. - I just finished working with Bermax Food Enterprises. - Yes, and Royce Rutherford was very happy with your work and he's a hard man to please. - I consult for major corporations. - I realize that working with a smaller company isn't what you're used to but this came across my desk, Gabe. The board reached out to us. They think that they're in trouble. Now, this is a unique situation and it requires a unique talent. - Oh, flattery? You're bringing out all the big tools. - Merry & Bright reminds me of what we used to do. Working with smaller independent companies helping them achieve their goals. - Can they afford us? - Well, I think we'll work something out. - It's almost two weeks until Christmas. Aren't they winding things down? - It's the Christmas season at a candy cane factory, Gabe. I would say things are winding up. It's the perfect time to go. Now, after your two weeks I'll need you to submit a preliminary report. We'll take it up in the new year and see where we stand. And if you're feeling the holiday itch, I hear that the Christmas season in Britewell is quite lovely. [playful music] - I don't even know where Britewell is. - Ohio. - Fine. - Great, I'll give them a call and tell them that you're on your way, and if you finish that report sooner rather than later, maybe you'll finally make it to one of our Christmas parties. - Merry Christmas. [gentle music] ["Deck The Halls" by John Ceiriog Hughes] - Yeah, I've always had that effect on people. They like me, I don't know why. They just do. - Hm [chuckles]. - Oh, hm. - So, my mom said that you used to uh, live in San Jose. You know I went to Stanford. - Yeah, Fresno State here. Yeah, football. - Oh, a Bulldog. - Yeah, through and through. [Cate chuckles] - I was actually on the badminton team. You know we won the-- - That's the one with the uh, the, the birdie? - Yeah, right, the one with the birdie. - Uh, excuse me? You know, I don't understand why she doesn't see me. [playful music] - I don't know, looks like you two aren't connecting. - Yeah, I guess not. - [Cate] Yeah. [playful music] [upbeat music] - Wow, it's quite a tradition that you're starting Cate. Making chocolates for every single employee. - I forgot how much I love doin' it. And you know, when's the last time you and me made chocolate together, like 10 years? Always leave 'em with something sweet. - Yeah, that's what your grandmother taught us. [gentle music] Oh, how was your date Cate? - Nice rhyme, mom. - Yeah, it's the school teacher in me. - Well it was uh, it was good. - Really? - Yeah, if good means excruciating. - Oh no. Jeffrey seemed like such a nice fellow. - Mom, I love you, but please stop setting me up with people okay? [playful music] There's, there's another one coming? - Well, it's Bernice's son, Gary. He's from Akron and he's staying all week at the Britewell Inn. He's here for a conference. - Mom-- - And so I thought that-- - Mom, mom, please. I just need to figure some things out for myself, okay? I'm just not ready to-- - You're not ready to date after Josh, I understand. - And I'm really busy. - I thought that getting out there might be just a nice distraction for you. - Oh, you know I'm thinking about getting a dog. - Oh, yes. That's what you were saying. - It might be nice to have a little companion that just doesn't talk about himself. - Well you can't really have a conversation with a dog, can you? They leave fur everywhere, chew up shoes, yapping at all hours. - And I might like that. [Joy scoffs] - Well, what do I know? I've never had a dog. - Remember that adorable scruffy little mix at the rescue shelter I was telling you about? - Mm hm. - Yeah, I stopped by after work. He was gone. - Oh, I'm sorry honey. Well, I guess it was just a matter of time. I'm sure he found a nice home. Anyway, good things come to those who wait. You never know what might be just right around the corner. - Let me guess, Gary from Akron? - You'll see. [Cate sighs] [playful music] Let's make sure we have an understanding. This is my house, my rules, and you are a guest here until Christmas Eve when I bring you to Cate. I don't want any trouble. No yapping. [dog barking] What did I just say? [dog barks] [dog whining] [upbeat Christmas music] [bell dings] - Sorry about that, I was just pluggin' in my monitor. Good morning Sir, my name's Pete. How can I help you today? - Good morning, Pete. Gabe Carter, I'm supposed to be checking in this evening but I'd like to do that now if possible. - Yes uh, just a second. - Did you get my message? - Uh... Here we are. - I like to get in town a little early, you know? Get a sense of the place I'm gonna spend some time in. - Not a problem at all Mr. Carter. Uh, so what's your sense of our little town so far? - It's, Britewell. [Pete chuckles] - Sure is. How long's your stay? - As short as possible. - What's that? - Nothing. - Well, it says here you're in for a week, with the option for two. Well if you're here for the holidays we have our annual Christmas Jubilee on December 24th. - Oh, Christmas Eve. - It's a tradition here in Britewell. The Jubilee, not Christmas Eve. [playful music] I mean Christmas Eve is a tradition too, but it's kind of a tradition everywhere, so [chuckles]. - Yeah, I'll be long gone before then. [upbeat music] - Hey Pete. - Hi Cate. [upbeat Christmas music] - Take out. - Take out order, right. Sorry, end of my shift, you're pickin' up your dinner. Got it, be right back. - Okay. [upbeat Christmas music] - Cate, Cate Merriweather. - Uh, yes? - I um, I uh, I saw a picture of you. - You did? - Yeah, on your company website. - I see. - I'm your guy. [playful music] You, you seem surprised. I thought you knew I was coming. - Oh, right. Yeah, my mom told me about this. - Oh, well, I don't mean to sound bold but what if I told you your problems are over? [playful music] - And what if I told you I'm just not interested? - Look, I get it. You think that this is a waste of time and in some ways I agree. - You do? - Well I was told I'm your last chance to turn this ship around. - Excuse me? - Look, I came all the way here. At the very least we can go for a nice dinner. - Uh, thanks but I already ate. - Hey, here's your dinner Cate. [playful music] - Perfect, thank you. - We can go for a coffee in the morning? Or a smoothie. Do you, you prefer smoothies? - Look, I really don't know how much clearer I can make this but we are not going on a date. So, lovely to meet you, have a nice night. - A date? - And merry Christmas. - I'm not here to ask you on a date. [playful music] - Aren't you from Akron? - New York. - Gary? - Gabe [laughs]. Gabe Carter. Empire-- - Corporate Recovery. [playful music] Hi [throat clears]. Cate Merriweather. Nice to meet you. - Right. [upbeat music] - Yeah. Just... [upbeat music] I feel so silly. I had no idea you were with Empire. - It's okay, we know who we are now and why we're here. - Although, I'm not sure how you can help. It wasn't my idea for you to come here. - Well, it wasn't mine either. [playful music] Think of me as your advisor. [playful music] That's some big candy canes. - Well, we do make Britewell the candy cane capital of the world. - So I hear. - And with the last two weeks before Christmas it's our busiest time. Plus, December 26th is a big day for us as well. - The day after Christmas? - It's National Candy Cane Day. - I had no idea. - Well, now you do. - I'm more of a National Pancake Day kinda guy. [Cate chuckles] [playful music] So, what makes Merry & Bright viable? - Well, our business model's been the same from the beginning. We're a seasonal company so, our busiest time's August through December and most of our business comes from contracts with regional and national distributors. - Just takin' notes. - I have some new ideas too but, these days I'm busy just trying to keep the place running. As I'm sure you've heard it's my first year here as CEO. I had to take over for my Grandma Carol who ran the place for 50 years. - You had to take over? So this, this wasn't your idea? - Why don't we try some product? Here you go. [playful music] - Where's yours? - I do plenty of taste testing. I'm fine. [playful music] - Let's get right to the point. You're paying more for sugar on average. Why? - Well, we've used the same farm for over 40 years. I figure if it's not broken-- - I guess that's my job to tell you that or not right? [Cate laughs] - Yeah, I think we're just fine in the sugar department. - Okay. Um, how 'bout your work force? - Uh, well we employ about 40 to 60 people depending on the time of-- - Another way to save costs is to-- - Wait, wait, what? Lay offs? Cut backs? - It's an option. Last resort but it's an option. - I think we're good. - Listen, Cate, I don't mean to-- - Gabe, look, I'm just getting my feet wet around here, okay? I haven't had a chance to put my stamp on anything and no offense but I don't really need you here right now. - Well no offense back but I don't really wanna be here either, but it's my job and it looks like we're stuck together. - Look, I have meetings the rest of the day so uh, why don't we talk tomorrow? Please, feel free to take a look around. [gentle music] [exhales] [gentle music] - Hm. - I just don't think it's a good idea, him being here. - What's wrong with it? - He's suggesting things. - To improve the company? - Well, yes. - To help us out? - Yes. - And that's not a good idea? [Cate sighs] - He thinks our sugar prices are too high, that we should be getting it cheaper. - What's wrong with that? - Nothing. You know, Grandma Carol was loyal to our sugar producers for decades. And he's already talking cutbacks. - So, you don't wanna lay anybody off and you don't wanna buy cheaper ingredients? - No. I mean, I would prefer to consolidate our departments more efficiently. You know, maybe source some of our ingredients a little... [Cate sighs] Oh. Maybe he's got some good points. I just wanna see Merry & Bright get back to its full potential. - We all do. Maybe you could use a little extra help. - Well, we did get off on the wrong foot. And maybe, maybe I should give him the benefit of the doubt. - It can't hurt. I bet he wants to believe in this company as much as you do. - Yeah. All right. Let's go find him. I'll introduce you. - Maybe while he's here we can introduce him to the community, get to know some of the people, see the town. I think he'd actually really like it. - It's a waste of time [laughs]. This place is like a giant snow globe. Live living in a slow time bubble. Sara, the whole business model is a dinosaur. And Cate. There's like, there's talkin' to a wall, and then there's talking to a brick wall. This might be an untenable situation. I might have to rethink everything. - Gabe, you're my number one recovery expert. - I know. - The man with the Midas touch. - Even Midas would have a tough time in Britewell. Rule number one in this business is you can't fix what somebody doesn't want you to fix. - Well then your day one report should be interesting. I'm looking forward to it. - It's gonna be a lotta blank pages. - Gabe, I know you don't wanna be there. I can feel that eye roll through the phone. You don't think a candy cane company is worth your time, but you might just surprise yourself. You never know what you might discover. [playful music] - Oh, it's a lovely tree this year, huh? Cate? - Hm? - I said the tree's really nice this year. - Oh, yeah. It's very festive. - Too many candy canes [laughs]? - They are my life now. I guess I should get used to 'em, right? - Yeah, I know you wanted to do other things, but you made grandma's wish to keep the business in the family possible and I know how proud she'd be of you. - What do you think of the star? - Did your dad give you the star? - I called him last night. - It's very nice. Yeah. I also brought some of grandma's ornaments. - [Cate] Oh. - Mm hm. [ornaments clattering] - Oh, I remember this one. [watch beeping] - Oh, gotta go. - Oh, well is everything okay? - Yeah, um, yes. I just, I have an event. I have uh, an appointment. - At this hour? - Um, uh, yes. Uh, Jennifer is stopping by. She's picking up a fruitcake, a Christmas fruitcake. - You made a Christmas fruitcake? You don't even like fruitcake. - Well, I'm turnin' over a new leaf. - A fruitcake leaf? - Yeah, exactly. Gotta go, bye. [Cate laughs] [playful music] [crickets chirping] [door latches] [gentle music] [dog barking] [playful music] [sighs] [dog barking] [playful music] - I didn't forget about you. [dog whines] Don't worry your furry little head. [dog barking] Wow, you are excited. [dog barks] Loud, but excited. Here's your treat. [dog barking] [dog munching] [playful music] Don't expect that all the time mind you. It's just certain times. [dog whining] Special times. [dog barks] [playful music] This is so, different for me, you know? Havin' someone else in the house, and don't get any ideas. Been on my own for five years and I like it fine. [dog whining] Well, I'll go have my dinner now. [gentle music] [dog whining] Comin'? [dog barking] [gentle music] - Hey, it's Pete. Is Sam from IT available? I think I crashed. - Hi. - Just, just a second. Um, yeah can you get 'em to call me when he has a chance please? Thank you. Hey, what's up? - You called to see me. - Yes, I did. Um, Sophie I have to talk to you about something. It's important. - Okay. Is Gabe stopping by the factory today? - Yeah. Lookin' forward to it. Like dental surgery. - Depends on the dentist. Oh, hey can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah. - I noticed Pete's been online shopping for mountain bikes. He left his laptop open. - Okay. - I think it's a Christmas gift for me. - Well, that's great. You love biking. - Well, that's true but, I'm, why is he getting me a big gift when I'd be happy with the tiniest little [laughs]... Remember? Christmas is the best time. - Well, why don't you just talk to him? - You mean, tell him I want him to propose? I, I can't do that. - No. No just, I don't know, feel things out. See if you're both in the same head space. - I think he wants to. I've tried to bring it up with him but he just changes the subject. - Maybe he's just nervous. - Maybe. I wanna talk to him about it but at the same time I need this to come from him, right? - Do you want me to talk to him? I mean, I'd be happy to. - Would you? - Yeah. - I mean, not to put any pressure on him or anything. - [Cate] No, no, no, no. Of course not. I'll just see how he's feeling. I'll find a time to talk to him. - That would be great. - No problem. - Good morning ladies. - [Sophie] Oh. - A little hot chocolate to start your day. - [Sophie] Oh, thank you. - Thanks. - Hey, I wanted to put some candy canes in there but I didn't know where to find any. [Sophie laughs] [playful music] Well, shall we get back to it? - Yeah. Yeah, right this way. [playful music] - Depends on the dentist. - You have a dentist appointment? - [Cate] No. - Okay, uh, let's talk about your company's strengths. - Yeah. Uh, Gabe before we get started, we got off on the wrong foot the other day, and the day before that [laughs]. So, for the next few days or however long you're here I'd like to get on the right one. - I'd like that very much. - Great. - So, low employee turnover. That's a really good sign. - Yeah, I'm really proud of that. We're a big family here at Merry & Bright. - Big family that loves makin' candy canes. - That's right. - Candy cane capital of the world. - Oh, you remembered. - Well, it's hard to miss. - Right [laughs]. [Gabe laughs] Christmas is a big deal in this town. - I'm sensing that. [Cate laughs] [Gabe chuckles] - So you spend your Christmases in New York I assume? - I, I don't really know where I'll be honestly. - Isn't New York home? - Yes, but I basically live out of a suitcase. On the downside I travel a lot over Christmas and miss out on a lot of festivities so I really don't know where I'll ever be. You know, a few times I've even, you know what we should, we should be talkin' about business. - Establishing rapport is the key to any successful business relationship. - Fair enough. I was gonna say that I've even spent Christmas Day at the airport. - On purpose? - Nothing says Christmas like moving sidewalks and luggage carousels. [Cate laughs] But you know what? I love what I do. - But everybody needs a home base. - One day. So, given your resistance to cutting costs in certain areas-- - Have I been resistant? - Another recommendation would be to generate alternative product ideas. Another way to cut costs is to increase potential profit. So, thank you for sending me this market research report. - I hired a marketing firm when I first got here. Just to get a clearer idea of where we stood. - That's smart. So national survey. 85% recognized the Merry & Bright brand name. So, strong brand recognition. That's, that's good. 98% would try another candy that you produced. Cate this, this is huge. Do you guys have any other products in your lineup? - I might. - What is it, a secret? - Well, if I told you I might have to give you one. [playful music] - Deal. - Here you go. - What are these? - Barber Poles. They're a replica of the original peppermint stick candy that was invented in 1837. It's uh, inspiration for what we know today as the candy cane. - Candy cane without the hook. - Yeah. We stated making them as a nostalgic treat specifically for the Christmas Jubilee. - What is that? - Well, it's our big Christmas event here in town. You probably won't be here for it but there's food and dancing. The whole community really comes together. In fact, the Britewell Christmas season kicks off tonight with the tree lighting at the Old Mill. I get to push the button. It's my second time. - Oo, sounds like an honor. - It is. - Does Merry & Bright make any other types of candy? - Mm, Carol was a very strong willed woman. - Translation, stubborn? - She knew what worked and she stuck with it. - Look [throat clears], I've consulted for some of the biggest candy and chocolate companies in the country, and it all boils down to this. Merry & Bright can no longer exist off of candy canes alone, with or without the hooks. - Gabe, of course I've thought about expanding the product line since I've been here. - So then what are you waiting for? - Waiting? I've only been here a year. - And? - And these things take time. My main focus has been getting the company back on track. - You know the candy market's overcrowded. - While also respecting - And so is changing. - my family's methods and traditions. - You either change with it or you... - Right. Oh, especially since we have a dinosaur business model. It's hard living in a snow globe though, you know, it's a slow time bubble. - You overheard me. - Yeah, it's like talkin' to a brick wall. - I was frustrated. I, I didn't mean any of that. I'm sorry. - It's okay. I know we have to change. - Diversity of product is one option. Alternative confections like, chocolate. - Chocolate? - I'm just tossing out ideas, you know? Exploring options together. - Can I show you something? [gentle music] Well, what do you think? - Wow! This reminds me of Santa's workshop, or my favorite toy store in New York. [Cate laughs] [Gabe laughs] - I like to come in here when I've had a rough day at work, you know? Reminds me of why I'm doing what I'm doing. I also like to end all the public tours in here. - You do tours? - Yeah, I do. My Grandma Carol started to do 'em and it's a tradition I like to keep alive. - That's her? - Yep. - She looks sweet, with a no nonsense business side. - Wow, you can tell a lot about her from a photo. - I'm very familiar with that type. - Ah. Not sure how she'd feel about Empire though. - Well, I hope she'd approve. We're just tryin' to help. [gentle music] - You know I, I got my MBA in California and I was actually working at a big marketing firm in Sacramento when I got the call about my grandma. [gentle music] It's honestly not what I thought I'd be doing. [gentle music] - Life happens when you least expect it. [gentle music] - Yeah. [gentle music] Uh, well I have a lot of meetings this afternoon so uh, you've given me a lot to think about. [Gabe chuckles] But um, I'm gonna go. I'll see you later. - Yeah. - Oh um, you know, I was gonna ask, are you uh, planning on going to the Christmas tree lighting later or? I mean, you're probably busy - Oh, right. - I'm sure. - Yeah I don't, uh, I have a lotta work I gotta catch up on. [Gabe's throat clears] - Yeah, of course. I'll see you later. - See ya, see ya later. [gentle music] [fire crackling] [gentle music] [fire crackling] - I'll be back soon. [dog barking] [dog whines] It's just the tree lighting. Takes five seconds. [dog barking] Oh, don't be difficult. You have your toys. You have your treats, you have your water, you'll be fine. [dog whines] [playful music] [sighs] [dog whines] [playful music] [upbeat Christmas music] Here we go. We are just gonna hang out over here on the fringes. All right, this'll be fun. It's your first tree lighting [laughs]. Can you see? Okay. But you know what? Let's go back down. Let's go back down. Let's go on back. We're gonna hide. Now get in the carrier. - [Announcer] Please welcome Cate Merriweather. [crowd cheering] [upbeat music] - Hey everyone. I am so excited and honored to get to push the button a second time. It's so great to see everyone here on such a beautiful night. So, are we ready to light the tree? - [All] Yeah! - All right, ready? - [All] One, two, three, aw! - [Woman] What happened? - Hey, what's goin' on? - Wait! Gabe! Come up here, you do it. - [Man] Hey! - [Cate] Come on Gabe. - Oh, no. [crowd cheering] - Gabe Carter everyone. Come on Gabe! - Oh no. Uh, guys I'm not, I'm not gonna go up and... - [Woman] Come on, go, go! - All right, all right, all right. Okay guys [laughs]. [crowd cheering] [crowd applauding] [Gabe's throat clears] - Ready? All right, let's try this again. - [All] One, two, three. [all cheering] [all applauding] [gentle music] - Well done. - That's pretty nice. - And this is the booth we sponsor every year. - It's nice. - Hey, Cate? Uh, hi, sorry. - Hi. - Um, have you had a chance to talk to... - Oh, oh, sorry no. I meant to. - The bike is in his shopping cart. We're in a definite situation here. - Right. I'm on it. Uh, will you excuse me for just a minute? - Yeah. - [Cate] I'll be quick. - Yeah. ["Deck The Halls" by John Ceiriog Hughes] - Hey Pete. - Oh, hey Cate. Nice assist on passing the tree lighting button. - Thanks, thanks. Can I talk to you for a sec? - Yeah, these'll stay hot. Sophie just loves this mulled cranberry cider. - [Cate] It is delicious. - Yeah. - So, speaking of Sophie, how many Christmases have you guys been together now? - Oh, it's probably four now. Three. No, this Christmas will make it four. - That's a good sign, right? - Really? Of what? - That there will be more Christmases to come, together. - Yeah, depends on how I do in the gifting department this year. - Oh well, I don't think it really matters. - Oh, I was just kiddin' [laughs]. [Cate laughs] I think I've done okay over the years. Had the ice skates and the espresso maker and the Chia Pet. - Yeah, yep. Those are all things that people need. - [Pete] Mm hm. - Well, maybe not the Chia Pet but... - Oh. - Anyway, look, what I'm tryin' to say is um, you know, Christmas gifts are a way to say I love you, right? - Yeah. - Okay, so what makes I love you this Christmas different from all the rest? - Well, I guess this Christmas it would be more like I love you forever. - Really? Okay, well think there's something you could definitely buy that would tell a young lady that? - Oh, and I think I have it. Top of the line mountain bike. [playful music] - I was thinking maybe something smaller, that she could wear. [playful music] - A bike helmet? - No, no it's something she could wear all the time. - Jewelry? - [Cate] Bingo. - Oh. But what kind of jewelry? - Pete. Okay? - But-- - I'm walking away now. Just think about it. [upbeat Christmas music] [Gabe sighs] - Oh. - Hey. - Hey. - Hot cocoa? - Thanks. - Everything okay? - Oh, yeah. Fine [laughs]. So uh, chocolate or peppermint? What ya like better? - I have to choose one? - Mm hm. - They go so well together. [Cate laughs] [Gabe laughs] - So, how'd it feel? - Lighting the tree? - Yeah. - It felt great. It was a real honor. Thank you. - [Cate] Sure. - So, did it ever not work? - The button? Yes. The infamous blackout of 1993. The Mayor pushed the button and not only did the lights not work but the power in the area went out for about two days. - Really? - Yeah. Yeah, it was not perfect but uh, the stars were really beautiful that night. - Cate, I wanted to ask you something. [playful music] - Is that my mom? Where's she goin' in such a hurry? - The gym maybe. - Gym? - Yeah, I got a gym bag that looks exactly like that. - Huh. Didn't even know she was workin' out. - Anyway I um, I have a bunch of reports I have to do tomorrow but I was wondering if we could catch up? - Over dinner? - That's what I was thinking. - Great. - Great, we, doesn't have to be a... - No, no, not a... - We'll just be takin' a break. - Yeah. - Yeah. - We can just, clear our heads. - Yeah. [gentle music] - What do you mean you're struggling? I guess there's a first time for everything. - I don't know. It's like uh, writers block. You know, call it corporate consulting block. It's just, this assignment is different. - How so? - I'm used to being in an office or a hotel room. I'm not used to being on the company ground floor. - And? - And, and, there's papers. Just tons of, tons of paper. Nothing's electronic. - Is that the only reason? [sighs] - I don't know. I just, I can't, I can't clear my head. I pushed the button at the Britewell tree lightening ceremony. - The what? - I've never felt anything like this before. It's just so festive. And everyone was so welcoming. It's like I belonged. And, and I do not belong in Britewell. - Hm, and who organized all of this? - Cate. Cate Merriweather. - Well, I think maybe I see another reason why you can't get any work done. [laughs] - What do, what do you mean? I didn't, I didn't say anything. - You said enough. Call it an instinct. [gentle music] - [Gabe] Hey, Pete. - Yeah? - I got a question for you. - [Pete] Sure. - What's your best restaurant in town? Outside of your fine dining establishment here of course. [Pete chuckles] - The Elegant Elk is always a good choice. Actually, there's a better one. - [Sophie] Stanton's? - [Pete] What? - You suggested Stanton's Restaurant? - They're one of the best. - Cate hasn't been back there since, you know. - No I, I don't know. - Since Josh. - Josh was at the, the place that Cate didn't... I knew I shoulda stuck with Elegant Elk. [Pete sighs] - [Sophie] Yeah. [upbeat music] - Hi. - Hi. - You look nice. - Thanks, you look nice too. - Everything okay? - Yeah, yeah, fine. Shall we? - Yeah, after you. [gentle music] [Cate laughs] - You know, I'm actually having a really good time with you tonight. - So am I. - I honestly wasn't sure that I would. Not because of you or anything. You're actually uh, quite charm... - What? What was that? - Uh, challenging. - I think you were about to say charming. - I was not. - Oh no, no, I think you, think you were. - Well, I never said it so I guess we'll never know. [Gabe laughs] - I, I do feel like I can open up to you a bit though. - Well that's, that's a good thing. So, what's on your mind? - I was a little distracted when I first got here. - I knew somethin' was up. - Last time I was at this restaurant, about a year ago and I got proposed to. - Oh. - Yeah, and I said no. - Really? I'm, I'm so sorry. I had, I had no idea. - How could you? It's fine. Yeah, Josh and I had met at school, then we moved to Sacramento. - And that's when you got the call about Merry & Bright? But he wanted you to stay in California? - Hm, you're good at this. Yeah, then he popped the question out of the blue, about a year ago on December 21st. I always knew deep down he wasn't the right one, but I don't think I ever really admitted it to myself, you know? I mean not 'til there was a tiny box with a little shiny ring staring back at me. It was hard but I had a choice and I made it. - Well, seems like you made the right one. - Yeah, I think so. - Have you talked to him since? - Yeah, we talk sometimes. He got engaged. He seems really happy. I'm happy for him. [gentle music] Guess I hadn't moved on as much as I thought. - Well, it takes time. Everybody's different. At least, that's my experience [laughs]. Yeah, I guess I opened that one up. - There's no goin' back now. - Well, my mother is a bit of a matchmaker. [laughs] - That's another thing we have in common. - Oh? - Mm hm. - Well, Veronica she, she came from the right family. She belonged to the right social circles, went to the right school, but we just, we weren't right for each other. Broke off our engagement after six months. - She didn't make you happy? Yeah, you can feel it in your heart. [gentle music] [laughs] It's funny, I think sometimes the heart can tell us more than any spreadsheet or book ever could but, trouble is learning how to read it. [gentle music] Well, that was a really lovely dinner, and thanks to Empire for treating. - Our pleasure. - Well, this is me. Oh, here um, this is for you. - You didn't have to-- - No, no. Please I made 'em for everyone at Merry & Bright for the holidays. - Thank you. - Okay. [handle clicks] Uh... [car beeps] [Gabe laughs] It's the thought that counts [laughs]. Good night. - Good night. [door slams] [engine starting] [gentle music] - [Cate] Loop it up over the top. Perfect. Maybe a little more on that side. Oh. Tangled there [laughs]. - Wow, you guys aren't kidding around with the Christmas Jubilee. [Cate laughs] - Look who's here. - This is gorgeous. - Thanks. We're about 10 days out. We decided to use the woods for party supplies this year so, cedar wreathes, pine cones and swags. My mom's in charge of decorations. Oh, that's my mom Joy. Mom, this is Gabe. - Oh, hi. The consultant. [Gabe laughs] - Nice to meet you. - So, what are you doin' here? - Well, I tried your chocolates last night and they're amazing. - Well, thanks. It was just for fun really. It's a peppermint candy recipe with some handmade chocolate. Nothing too original. [watch beeping] - Oh! I, I gotta run. It was very nice meeting you. Jennifer's picking up some snickerdoodles. [Gabe laughs] - Nice to meet you too. - She's gotten really fast. [Gabe laughs] Gym's been payin' off [laughs]. - So, I was thinkin' about the craft chocolate market, which is huge right now. And this, this could be the break we've been lookin' for. - You wanna turn Merry & Bright into a chocolate company? - No, no, not at all. I mean, exploring a year round alternate revenue source to better compete in the market. - I mean, I love chocolate but, I don't know that it's really who we are. And we can't really afford the money for new machines right now. - That's why you need an investor. And I happen to know the biggest one there is. Royce Rutherford, Bermax Food Enterprises. - Wait, you know Royce Rutherford? - I do. I just finished a big contract with him. - Bermax is huge. But, they don't actually make any foods. - No, they just buy and invest in smaller companies that make the products. - Well Merry & Bright isn't for sale. - Yes, but I know for a fact he's looking to invest in a company that can produce an artisan chocolate product. Expand your lineup. Can you make other flavors? - Yeah, probably. I mean, I know grandma's got some old recipes. How 'bout three or four different kinds? - How 'bout six or eight? - How 'bout you help me? - Deal. [playful music] [upbeat music] [knocking] [upbeat music] - Cate. - Hi, sorry I didn't call. I thought I'd just-- - Just one second. [door slams] - Mom? [playful music] - Sorry about that. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, fine. - Are, are you sure? Okay. - Why don't we just talk uh, out here? I could use the fresh air. - Uh, sure. You sure you're okay? - I'm fine, I'm fine. It's just [sniffs], it's so crisp. - You'd tell me if something was wrong, right? - Of course, of course. There's nothin' wrong. I promise. - Okay uh, well, I wanted to see if I could borrow grandma's old recipe book if that's all right? - Oh. Sure. I'll get it for you. - Oh, great thanks. [door slams] [playful music] It's Grandma Carol's old recipe book. Goes all the way back to her very first candy canes. I haven't looked at this in years. [Gabe laughs] Oh wow. You know, I know she's got some good chocolate ideas in here. - [Gabe] Look at you. - Mm [laughs]. [Gabe laughs] I used to love these. Gingerbread candy canes. She used to make these for us when I was a kid at Christmas. I haven't had one in forever. - Did she ever make any of these for the company? - No. No, but she liked to experiment on the side. I was a happy little guinea pig as a kid. - Yeah, no kidding. Sweet Christmas bonus. - Mm hm. Oh, here we go. - Oh wow, these look interesting. Coconut butter cream. French toast chocolate? - Butter and maple syrup. - Looks delicious. [Cate laughs] [playful music] - Well, welcome to the Merriweather kitchen Mr. Carter. [playful music] - Am I supposed to wear this? - Yeah, I think you might need it. [playful music] - Here we go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Oh, hi Barb. - Joy Merriweather, did you get a dog? - This is a present for Cate. I'm giving her a surprise at the Jubilee on Christmas Eve. - Oh, sweet. Well I won't tell anyone. Mum's the word. - Thanks. - [Barb] Here you go. - Thank you. You did such a good job. Yes you did, that's a good boy.

Actually, it's more his wife. - Oh, well women do have exceptional taste in chocolate. [playful music] [fire crackling] Ah. [Gabe sighs] - [Gabe] Reindeer socks. - Yeah, I like reindeer. - You like all kinds of reindeer or just Santa's? - Well, Santa's get all the hype but I like 'em all. - Well, you could have one as a pet. [Cate laughs] [Gabe laughs] - I don't think my neighbors would appreciate that. They might be okay with a dog though. - You wanna get a dog? - I do. Oh, I had my eye on this really cute little rescue at the shelter. Somebody got to him before I did. Well, you snooze you loose, right? - I guess it's like that with all kinds of relationships. It's all about the timing. - Maybe it's a sign. - A sign? - Yeah, I'm not ready.

[Cate laughs] [Gabe laughs] - I know the feeling. - For somebody who didn't wanna be here [sighs], I'm happy to be here. - I'm happy too. [gentle music] [fire crackling] I, I am exhausted [laughs]. - Yeah [throat clears], yeah it's getting late, right? I have a bunch of phone calls I have to make. New York never sleeps [laughs]. - So they say [laughs]. [gentle music] - I'll have my office book our tickets in the morning. - Our tickets? - We leave Tuesday for New York. [Cate laughs] - What? - What's so funny? - I thought you just said we leave Tuesday for New York. - I did. Our presentation at Bermax in Manhattan. - Seriously? - Merry & Bright chocolate. Royce wants to see us right away. I thought I, didn't I say something to you? [playful music] Must've slipped my mind. - That is some slip. I thought you would be going. You and Royce know each other so well. - Well, it's your product, your company, and I am not a salesman. - Sure but, I'm a little rusty on my pitch and presentation. I mean, I've been out of the game-- - It's like riding a bike. You'll do great. - I've never been to New York. - Cate, this is a golden opportunity. [Cate sighs] - Bermax is such a big deal. - Yes, it is. And sometimes you just have to be bold, take a chance. - What if he says no? - Why say that? - Because it's possible. - Yes, but-- - What if I let everybody down? Merry & Bright, myself? I'm trying to honor my family's legacy, and I know the company needs to change. I just don't know what the right thing to do is. - You can't win if you don't play. If you don't wanna do it I'll let Royce know but, I need to know soon. [gentle music] Have a nice night.

Please tell me it's not a mountain bike. - New pillows for the rooms. These ones have reindeer on them. - Oh, how nice. I like 'em. - [Pete] Thanks. - So, I wanted to ask, - Hm? - How'd Sophie' Christmas present go? - Oh, I spent over an hour in the jewelry store. I finally picked one but I wanted to show you a picture before I bought it. - Oh, no, no. Don't do that, okay? Just, you be confident. This is your choice and your decision, your... Oh, it's a, it's an infinity symbol. - It literally says forever. - Uh, yeah it's uh, it's a beautiful uh, necklace. - But? [Cate sighs] - Okay, I can't do this anymore Pete. Are you gonna ask Sophie to marry you or what? [Pete sighs] What? - Cate, I'm not that clueless, I get what's going on. - You certainly have a weird way of showing it. - Part of it's an act. - What do you mean? - I'm scared Cate. - What do you have to be scared of? She loves you. - And I love her too. I'm crazy about her. - Okay, then what's the issue? - What if I propose and she says no? - That, that is not gonna happen. - Proposals are such a big deal. They take, take planning and, and thought and-- - Well yeah, but every proposal is different. You know from the jumbotron at a basketball game to the, oh that was a very big example. Don't, something smaller can be just as lovely. All right? Maybe, I mean, is there a place that you two have special memories together? - Yeah, there is. - Okay, good. It's okay to be scared, just don't let it stop you from living your life or being happy you know? Be bold, take a chance. [gentle music] Where's Gabe? - He was in the lounge last I saw him. - Great, thanks. [gentle music] Hi. - Hi. - So, this coat'll be okay in New York? [chuckles] [gentle music] [laughs] [gentle music] [upbeat music] - You have your toothbrush, you have your water bottle, you have your treats? - My treats? - I meant your snacks [chuckles]. - Mom, I'm fine. - Uh maybe, maybe a nice dress for a night out. - Mom, relax. I've got everything handled, okay? Thank you. What is going on with you lately? - What do you mean? - I think I know what's going on. - You do? - Yeah. And it's great and I don't know why you have to hide it and make all these excuses. - I wanted to surprise you. - Mom, I'm really happy that you're goin' back to the gym. [playful music] I mean, I know you haven't been in awhile so it must be all kinds of new emotions you know? Feelin' like a new person. - Yeah. - It's okay. You know, when I get back from New York, why don't we go for jogs like we used to? - Yeah, that would be great. - [Cate] Yeah? - Yeah. - I'm really happy for you [laughs]. - [exhales] Have a great time in New York. - I will. [gentle music] [elevator dings] [Gabe sighs] - Tracy. - Mr. Carter. - Cate Merriweather. - Hi. - Pleasure. - Nice to meet you. - I'll let Mr. Rutherford know you're both here. - Thank you. [employees chattering] [Cate sighs] - Hm. [employees chattering] [elevator dings] - So? How do you feel? - Nervous. - That's good. That means you're excited, you care. - You look calm. - Well, looks can be deceiving. If I was to say I was calm I'd be lying. - If you were to say. - Were? - Well, were is preferable to was when speaking in the hypothetical. School teacher mom. - Look, one thing about Royce, he can be tough. - How tough? - Mr. Rutherford is ready for you. [gentle music] - I got your back. [gentle music] - Merry & Bright's cocoa confections would have extensive appeal in the retail market. Our goal is to capitalize not only on our loyal customer base but also on high end and high traffic clients as well. Places like hotels, resorts, airports and specialty shops. - So, I'm a little unclear. You'd like to make chocolates but you're a candy cane company? - Yes, uh, this would be as a, as a year round alternative to our current lineup. - A current lineup that just has candy canes? - Correct. We're looking to diversify. You know, in today's market I-- - Today's market has no time for companies with identity issues. People want a clean simple bite sized story. What's your story? Do you know who you are? [gentle music] - Yes, yes I do. We're Merry & Bright, family owned and operated for over 50 years. We do one thing and we do it well, but sometimes that's not enough. I made these chocolates with Gabe from a trusted family recipe and we had a great time. I think they're really special so, try 'em, don't try 'em, your choice. I'm fine either way. [gentle music] - All right. Let's give these chocolates a day in court. [gentle music] What's this one? - Coconut buttercream. [gentle music] - It's um, okay. - [Cate and Gabe] Okay? - It's okay. [gentle music] - Royce is hard to read. He'll give us a call back in a day or so. I thought you did really well. - Thanks [chuckles]. It felt really good. - I was worried. You know, I brought you all the way over here and if nothing came of it then it would just all be for-- - It wouldn't be for nothing, Gabe. You know, doing that pitch it not only reminded me of why I love business but, something about being in that room and pitching my grandmother's recipes, I just felt really connected to the company, you know? Merry & Bright really meant something to me. - That's great. - Yeah. And I'm in New York at Christmas time, you know? Thanks to you. - Yeah, you know what? We are. We get the rest of the day, why don't we make the best of it? - Okay. Any ideas? - Yeah, I think I do. - Okay. - Follow me. [gentle music] - Wow. I can see why you love this toy store. - Oh, I'd spend hours here as a kid growin' up. Dream of all the toys I would buy. Couldn't afford much back then. - Oh. - My mom, she worked three jobs when I was growin' up. Raised me on her own. And put herself through business school and then somehow found the time to get Empire off the ground. She started out helping small local companies and took off pretty quickly. - Wait, your mom founded Empire? - That's right. - So your mom is the CEO of Empire? - Sara Carter. We're a family run business too. - Well, I guess you can come in here and buy any toy you want now. - And I do. [Gabe laughs] [Cate laughs] Go ahead, pick, pick a few out. I donate them all to the Toys For Tots charity. They keep a hamper in the front. - Ah, nice. [gentle music] You know, Sophie would love this store. My mom would too actually. Although I can hear her now. She's gonna say you went all the way to New York and all you did was go to a toy store? - Well, we got that party tonight. - Wait, what party? - Oops. - Wait, what, what party? - [Gabe] Musta slipped my mind. - Gabe, we seriously need to work on this memory of yours. What party are you talking about? [gentle music] [guests chattering] [gentle music] Hi. [guests chattering] [gentle music] - Hey. [guests chattering] [gentle music] Hi. - Hi. - Thanks. Wow, this is, it's really something. - Yeah, yeah. My mother does Christmas really well. I can't believe I finally made it back for one of her parties. [Cate laughs] [Gabe laughs] Uh, Cate Merriweather, meet Sara Carter, CEO of Empire Corporate Recovery. - Pleasure to meet you. We spoke on the phone. - I'm so glad you could come. - Your home is lovely. - Thank you. I hope everything went well with the Bermax presentation today? - Yeah, I think it went well. - Good to hear. You two excuse me. - Yeah. ♪ Have yourself a merry little Christmas ♪ ♪ Let your heart be light ♪ - What? - I feel a little... - Out of place? - Yeah.

[Cate laughs] [Gabe laughs] ♪ If the fates allow ♪ - You know when I was a kid, my dad used to bring me back posters from all of his business trips. - Does your dad live in Britewell? - He used to. He lives overseas now. My parents have been divorced about five years. But um, this one time I remember he brought me back a poster of the New York City skyline. I had it in my room and I used to lay in bed just imagining what it would be like to be in the center of all that, you know? All the lights, all the people. It's pretty enchanting. And now I'm actually here. - Does the real thing compare to everything you imagined? - Mm hm. ♪ Never near to us once more ♪ - I wanna show you something. - Okay. ♪ Through the years we all will be together ♪ ♪ If the fates allow ♪ Wow. This place goes on forever. - It's pretty cool, huh? - Yeah. Is this what you wanted to show me? - [Gabe] What do you think? - I think it's the least New Yorky thing I've seen since I've been here. [Gabe laughs] - You're probably right. - Wow, that really reminds me of the Old Mill, with the pine trees and everything. - Like the one we lit up. - You lit up. - I didn't wanna say anything but, when we first got to that tree lighting ceremony, I saw the barn and the trees, the whole atmosphere, the feeling in the place. It immediately reminded me of this. - [Cate] Where is this place really? - Nowhere. It's made up. - How do you know? - Because my dad painted it. - Oh, your dad? - Yeah, a long time ago. It was a Christmas present hung in my room forever when I was a kid. I stared at it for what seemed like hours imaging a place this this. It seemed so magical. You know, the colorful sky, the snowy pines. I had never been to the countryside as a kid. [gentle music] I just had to trust that it was there. - And you found it. - Yeah, I did. [gentle music] - Gabe? Gabe? Uh, the McGuire's are here. I thought you might want to-- - Thanks, great. - Yeah. - Well... - Well... - Well... [Gabe laughs] I think that's my cue to leave. - Now? - I have an early flight. - Right. - But this trip was, it was really special. Really. And quite inspiring even if the pitch didn't go our way. - Yeah, we'll figure somethin' out. - About the business or... [gentle music] It was a nice moment. - I thought so too. - But, let's call it what it was. It was a magical night. You live here and you travel all over the country. I'm in Britewell. It, I'm really busy with the business right now-- - Cate I, I understand. You're not ready for a dog. [Cate laughs] [Gabe chuckles] - Right. - Why don't I walk you out? Get you a cab? - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. [gentle music] [phone ringing] - [Gabe] Hello? - Gabe, Royce Rutherford. - Royce, let me guess. You tried more of the chocolates and you love them. [Royce laughs] - No, but you know what? My wife really loves them. And you thought I was a tough cookie. Look, I'm gonna get straight to the point. You know me, I go by gut instinct and I believe in relationships and you know I like you Gabe, and I like Cate. She seems really smart and together. - Yeah, she is. - As you know, we own and invest in a wide range of smaller food companies. Cereal, pasta, vegetables, baking goods, but the one thing missing in our brand portfolio is investment in a startup chocolate company. I think Merry & Bright could become that chocolate company. The infrastructure is there, and more importantly brand loyalty is there according to this market report you sent me. Thank you. Bringing in new machines won't be a problem. I have connections there and obviously we would hire the best chocolatiers. It's win win for everyone. - This, this all sounds great Royce. What about the candy canes? - Yes, Gabe that is a question. What about the candy canes? [upbeat music] [dog barking] - Come on good boy. Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Good boy. [dog snarling] [upbeat music] - Hey Cate. I talked to Bryan about the small batches and he said it's no problem. Should be done by the end of the day. Ingredients were easy to find. - Great. - Gingerbread, eggnog and sugarplum candy canes. It's perfect for the Christmas Jubilee. - And perfect for our thank you gift to Bermax. You know what? Add the key lime and the French toast too. And, let's make sure we find the nicest Christmas box we can for that okay? - Sounds good. - My grandma Carol said, - [Cate and Sophie] always leave 'em with something sweet. [Sophie laughs] [phone ringing] [keyboard keys clacking] - Hey Gabe. - Cate, I got good news. Royce loves the chocolate idea. - What? That's great. - Marry & Bright Chocolate Company. How's that sound? - Uh, I'm sorry, wait, what did you say? - Merry & Bright partially converts to a chocolate company with Bermax as its major investor. This, this is huge. - But Merry & Bright isn't a chocolate company. We make candy canes. - Well no, you'll still make those it just won't be the primary focus of the company anymore. And who knows, if chocolates really take off you might not even need to make those at all. The key is you gotta get this going as quickly as possible. Chocolate is a year round business. This is exactly what you've been lookin' for. - I, I don't know what to say. - You don't have to say anything. Legal's drawing up the paperwork as we speak. He's flying his assistant out tomorrow and, I'd really like to be there too. I feel like we did this together. - Okay. All right, bye. [gentle music] - A chocolate company? But would, would you still do candy canes? - Yeah, but they just wouldn't be our primary focus anymore. I guess it helps us. I mean having Bermax as a major investor's pretty big. We'd still be called Merry & Bright but I... - But what honey? - Is it worth it? I mean, you knew grandma better than anyone else. Did she ever wanna expand the lineup? Try out new ideas? - Grandma believed in tradition but that is not to say that she didn't have some new ideas up her sleeve. But maybe, just not enough time to realize them all I guess. [gentle music] - Whenever I look at the Christmas tree and that angel holding the candy canes. - [Joy] Grandma's favorite. - I just wonder you know, what would she think about all this? [gentle music] - This is your company now. This company's seen its ups and downs, but your grandmother was a fighter, and she believed in the product and in the way that it made people feel about Christmas. That's why we're still the candy cane capital of the world. - But the market's changing. I don't know that seasonal's enough anymore. We need something year round. Complicates my decision. - And maybe Gabe complicates your decision too? I can tell how you feel about him. [gentle music] - So? If I were grandma, what would I do? - Everyone loved Carol, but honey you don't need to be her. You need to be you. [gentle music] - I think everything's in order. Has legal been over this? - Yeah. - Just sign there and there. - Gabe uh, I'm really struggling with this. - I understand. - I hope so. I don't know if this is the right thing to do. - Cate [laughs], don't overthink this. It's a win win for everybody. You said you wanted corporate recovery and this is as good as it gets. - Uh, first of all, okay? It wasn't my idea for Empire to come here. And second this, this is not recovery. This is a complete overhaul. - This is a great deal for everybody. - Is it? I mean, how good of a deal is it if we lose who we are? - Cate-- - Gabe, I really thought that you knew what I was about, what I stood for. [gentle music] I thought you knew me. [gentle music] - I, I guess I don't know what you want. [Cate scoffs] - No. No Gabe, you really don't. [gentle music] - This is a mistake. - A mistake I'll have to fix all on my own. - She wouldn't sign? Well, does this mean you'll be back in New York for Christmas? - I, I don't know. - Well you're done with Merry & Bright, why stay? - You know I uh, I've decided in the new year I think I wanna start doing consultations for smaller companies. Help them out, you know the way that you did when you first started. - Oh. - I have to admit, things didn't turn out the way I hoped they would. Apparently I still have a lot to learn. - Well, you're still my number one recovery expert, and your ideas mean a lot to me. And this might be one of your best yet. - Thanks mom. - You're welcome. [Gabe sighs] [gentle music] - Mm. Mm. [gentle music] - Okay. [gentle music] - You're making me nervous Pete. [Pete laughs] - If you could just stand here, please. Yeah. Um, actually if you could go a little closer to the fire, please. - Closer to the fire? - [Pete] Yeah. - Okay, now you're really making me nervous. [Pete laughs] Okay. Here I am, by the fire. - We had our first kiss in front of this fireplace. - Okay, maybe don't get too close [laughs]. - Right, right. Um, you know, maybe it would be better if you stood here and face me. Okay, I think we're good now. - What's going on? Oh my gosh. [bell dings] - Just a second. [gentle music] Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh. [bell dinging] - Please I'm trying to propose! - Propose! [gentle music] [Pete's throat clears] [gentle music] - Sophie Candice Murray, I've loved you since the day we met. Would you marry me? - Yes. Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes. [gentle music] [Sophie laughing] [Pete laughs] - Let me get up, let me get up. - Oh, oh! [gentle music] - You look so handsome. [dog whining] You're gonna meet your new owner tonight. Mm hm. It's my daughter Cate, and you'll like her 'cause she's fun and she's smart and she's loving. [dog whining] [gentle music] She makes me so proud. [dog whining] [gentle music] Aw, don't be that way. You two are, you're gonna be really happy together. You are. We've had some good times haven't we? [dog whines] [gentle music] And don't get me wrong. You've chewed some things that I didn't want you to chew and you do leave fur everywhere but, it's nice to come home and you're here. [dog whining] [gentle music] Oh dear. [dog whining] [gentle music] Yep, I'm gonna miss you too. Bye. [dog whining] [gentle music] [upbeat music] ♪ Christmas is near ♪ ♪ Christmas is just 'round the corner ♪ - Hey. Enjoy. Those are eggnog. New flavors are a hit. Where's Sophie? ♪ Christmas is just 'round the corner ♪ ♪ Now can you stay ♪ ♪ Now can you just stay forever ♪ - [Gabe] Hi Cate. - Gabe. - Remember how you said I wouldn't be here for the Christmas Jubilee? Well, I'm here for the Christmas Jubilee [laughs]. ♪ Christmas is just 'round the corner ♪ Cate, I just wanted to let you know-- - Gabe, before you say anything I need to tell you something, okay? We are not a chocolate company. This company exists because a very strong woman fell in love with little candy sticks with red and white stripes on them because of the way they made people feel about Christmas. And that was her legacy and now it's mine too. And I love this company. We're Merry & Bright, we make candy canes. We're not perfect but it's what we do. And I hope you can respect that. - I can and I do, and I think you have the respect of Royce Rutherford as well. - What do you mean? Have you spoken to him? - Somebody wants to speak to you. - Hello. - Cate Merriweather, Royce Rutherford. I'm sorry to bother you on Christmas Eve. - Uh, no, no bother at all. It's fine. - When I really like something [laughs] and that doesn't happen very often, I wanna let people know right away and I really enjoyed those candy canes you sent me. - Um, yeah, thank you. - Yeah, I've never tasted anything quite like them. The eggnog and sugarplum and my wife and I were both floored by the gingerbread. It reminded us of the baking my grandmother used to do during the holidays. - I'm very glad sir. - Listen, have you thought about rolling them all out next Christmas? - You know, actually I, I have. - We're on to something Cate. Let's forget about the chocolate. All to say that we at Bermax wanna be your major distributor. We can get you deep access to markets not only coast to coast but worldwide. And who knows? Maybe there's a possibility for year 'round candy canes, not only for Christmas. Listen, let's talk in the new year. Merry Christmas, Cate to you and your family. - Uh, yes thank you. Um, merry Christmas to you and your family too Mr. Rutherford. Bye. [gentle music] [Cate laughs] [Gabe laughs] Is this for real? - It is and it's all you. - Is this why you came here tonight? - Cate, I came because-- - Hi honey. Hi [laughs]. - Oh, hi mom. Did you go to the gym again? - I have a surprise for you, for Christmas. Uh... [zipper zipping] [Cate gasps] [Joy laughs] Here you go. This is your new owner. - You were the one that got him? - I just wanted to make sure that you had him. - He's been with you all this time? - Mm hm. That's right. - Oh. - I know, I'll miss you too. And I will come and see you whenever I get a chance, okay? [dog whines] All right, so you go see Cate. Go see Cate. Go see her. - Hi. - Go, go, go, go. - Come here little friend. - Go over there. - Oh hello. Hi. - All right. It's okay honey, don't be difficult. I will come and see you. I promise I will. [dog whining] - Mom, he's so adorable. I love him. [dog whining] I can't wait to come visit him all the time. - What do you mean? - 'Cause he's all yours. - [Joy] What? - Merry Christmas, mom. - Aw. - You got a new dog. - Oh, thank you honey. This is a wonderful, perfect Christmas gift. - Go enjoy momma. - Buh bye. [gentle music] [guests chattering] - So, you were saying? ["Silent Night" by Franz Xaver Gruber] - You feel out of place? - No. Do you? - I feel right at home. Shall we, Miss Merriweather? - Charmed Mr. Carter. ["Silent Night" by Franz Xaver Gruber] The new Christmas candy cane flavors were an amazing success. Eggnog, sugarplum, gingerbread, I even included French toast. I introduced cinnamon for Valentines and then key lime for Saint Patrick's Day and pumpkin spice for Halloween, all from Grandma Carol's original recipes. Well, actually the pumpkin spice was mine. Now, I like to finish off all my tours in here so that I can finally say, as both your tour guide and CEO of the company, who wants a candy cane? - [All] Me! [Cate laughs] - All right, fantastic. My amazing assistant Sophie here is gonna hand those out and I hope you all enjoy. There you go. Okay thanks. - Who wants one first? - [All] Me! - Okay, okay, okay. All right. Aw. - I'm glad you guys enjoyed the tour. It really helped me. Yeah? - I have a question. - What is it? - What makes your candy canes taste so much better then the others? - Well, that's because each one is made with love. [Cate laughs] Here. Merry Christmas. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Enjoy [giggles]. - It's a great tour. - Thanks. - I gotta run. I'll see you later. - Yeah. Before you go uh, would you mind taking a look at the new sugarplum mints? They just came in. - Sure, perfect. Wait, in here? - Mm hm. ♪ Within your ♪ - [Gabe] It's even better if you open it up. - Gabe. And that's the story of the Merry & Bright Candy Cane Company. A story about family, tradition, and candy, all made with love, the most precious ingredient we have.
