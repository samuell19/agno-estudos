Oh Jesus, no, no! - [L.A.] What happened, do you think? - Well, it looks like the guy driving the station wagon had himself a heart attack. There's no skid marks so he didn't even get a chance to apply his breaks. (sirens blaring) From the looks of the damage, the guy had to be doing at least 55 miles an hour when he collided into the bus. - [Camera Man] Okay, L.A., we're ready. - All right, lieutenant, we're on. We're speaking with Lieutenant Calvin Buckert of the Dallas Police. Lieutenant - Good afternoon, I'm Larry Swain. Tragedy struck at an early hour today when an automobile collided with the north Dallas elementary school bus. Three children and the driver of the car were killed and at least a dozen others seriously injured. KSTX News reported Lamoine Peabody was at the accident scene where he talked with public information officer Calvin Buckert. - How many units do you have here lieutenant? - Well we've got six police elements working traffic and two fire ambulances that are carrying the casualties. - [L.A.] Are all the children out of the bus? - As far as we know they are and this could very well be the worst accident in Dallas' history. - Preliminary indications are that Vanhees suffered a heart attack, lost control of his automobile, ran a stop sign and then crashed into the side of the oncoming bus. The official cause of Vanhees death will be verified by an autopsy now underway at the medical examiner's office. A Dallas federal judge stepped down from the bench today. I'll be back with that and other stories right after these few brief words. - [Male] 59, this is 652. - Go ahead 652. - [Male] 59, they're transferring the hitchhiker killer. Better get over there now. - Okay we're going, ten four. What's the chance of getting an exclusive with this kid, Jack? - May have none, L.A.. He hasn't said a word since he got here, not even when they showed him a pic. (reporters shouting) - Quiet, quiet please. Now if you'll all just calm down we're gonna bring this man out of here. I sure would appreciate it if you'd make a path clear through here. You can take all the pictures you want but for now no questions please. (reporters shouting) - [Chris] Do you know what's going on back at the station about now? Bubba's showing the boss man that film we did on Komar. - [L.A.] That's a mistake. He'll hate it. - [Chris] You got to be kidding. A guy that actually walks on fire? He'll love it. (grunts) (tape rolling) - [L.A.] When you're preparing to do one of your feats, what are you actually doing? - [Komar] Well actually I'm trying to throw myself into an altered state of consciousness. In the testing that has been going on on me they did find that I worked in altered states of consciousness and that's down in the alpha and theta brain wave states. And that while I'm in these states of mind, I do have control over the autonomic nervous system but when I go on the fire walk, I'm not sure but when I don't go down into the delta range but this is still to be tested to find out. I'm walking around drinking pop and possibly chain smoking and pretty soon bing, I know I'm in that state of mind and I can go. It's almost like a trancelike state but I'm fully conscious of what I'm doing at all times. - [L.A.] How 'bout using your same methods to cure an illness such as cancer, arthritis or whatever? - [Komar] In myself, I've been able to manage that because I haven't been sick in over 25 years. - [L.A.] With anything? - [Komar] Nothing. - You've worked with children, retarded children, at the Kennedy Foundation? - Yes, I did work with Ted Kennedy, (mumbles) and the Kennedy Foundation. I was one of 19 people who was called to Washington by them to help set up the Special Olympics program for the mentally retarded. - [L.A.] Do you think you'll ever teach your method where they can come and learn what you have to offer? - [Cobar] Once science has fully discovered what it is that makes me click, we may have some answers. - What is that? - Some footage Chris Lowe shot on the guy that walks on fire. - Get rid of it! I said get it off, I don't want that crap around here. This is not a side show, it's television. - How you feeling L.A.? Are you feeling okay? - Super A1 cowboy. How 'bout yourself? - Tired. Jesus, I get so tired it's beginning to get to me, buddy, dealing with all this pain. - [L.A.] What pain? - [Chris] Everybody's, yours, mine, it's like a war going on all the time. (mysterious music) - [L.A.] It is a war, man, you can't change it. Forget it. Every mother's child's gonna have to learn to street fight, that's all. - [Chris] Yeah, hi Eileen, give me the newsroom, will you hon? Yeah Bubba, Chris. Listen, I got some marks for you on that bust thing, all right? Nah, I doubt if we'll be in till later. Well tell her I'm busy. Never mind, I'll call her later. And Bubba, call Jack, it's important.

She's in Nicholson's new picture. - [L.A.] She any good? - [Chris] I don't know. I'm gonna find out tonight I hope. (laughs) - Pull back from the statue and zoom in on her two shot, okay? - I think there ought to be more leading roles for women. I'd like to play parts like Bette Davis did years ago or I can imagine playing a character like Katherine Hepburn. I think it would be a great challenge as an actress. And also show-- - Show women as something more than supporting players? - Yes. - Is this the first time you've done a sex scene in a motion picture? How did you feel about it? - I worried about it at first. After all, I am a serious actress and that sort of thing is so frequently done without taste, especially in foreign films. - Cut. Chris. - I want to go home, I want to shower. I haven't had-- - I'm gonna ask her once more about that sex scene and I want you to go in tight on her face. Okay? - Okay. - Kay. - I'm tired. I haven't slept in three weeks. - Let's get rid of the dogs. - It's too much for anyone. - Thank you very much, thank you, thank you.

And who wants you anyway? Because I have had it, you understand? I have had it. - Really good. Then get out. - Get out? This is my apartment, Lamoine, my apartment and besides I am tired of living with some kind of a creep. - What did you call me? - [Iris] You figure it out, bastard. Go ahead and hit me.

And Ev goes, "I guess 'cause I'm cold." He goes, "Well boy, if I was you, "I'd do something to get me warm "'cause your teeth are starting to rattle." No, no, no, no, no, no, no, he was clean but I wasn't. Yeah, I told ya, I had two mollies, some hash and Sandy had some (mumbles). Of course, like I told you, yeah. He goes, "How well do you girls know these two boys?" And Sandy goes, " We know 'em real well. "He's Bubba and he's Everett." Wait a minute, hold on a second. Hey Chris, you looking for that thing you submitted about the old guy living in the church? - Yeah. - Production turned it down, I got it here somewhere. - Oh, don't tell me that. - Yeah I did, said it wasn't relevant or something.

Hi Pat, I was just down to your office-- - L.A., Larry Swayne is going to Washington for three days. I want you to take over the anchor spot. - Dynamite. - Oh listen, Pat, I wanted to know how you liked my little program on the old man? - Answer that. - I do not think it is necessary for you to upset the production office by shouting obscenities at my secretary. - Well you see, sir, I waited a whole week for an answer on the program-- - I am not really interested in how long you waited for anything. - Yes, sir. - You understand? - Yes, sir. - You have any complaints, you come to me. - Yes, sir, I appreciate that. - Here's your little prospectus, I don't think we have any use for it. - Yes, sir. - Sorry. - The ice man's really down on you, cowboy. (country music) - So what I want you to do is a little show that had some kind of humility, do you know what I mean? I found this old guy in this abandoned church for years worshiping, kind of conducting his own services by himself. Thanks. Anyway, it would've made a great story and they turned it down. I keep coming up with these little ideas and can't go anywhere with them. - Why don't you just blow 'em off, man? - You know, I've thought about it. - Screw 'em, what do you care? - Yeah, Trip, I'm just about there. Hey Jeanie, how are you? - Oh Chris, listen, you know Bradley. - Sure do. Who's this pretty little thing over here? - Carol, this is Chris Lowe. - My pleasure. (country music) - You getting in shape for a pie eating contest or what? - Iris is playing around on me. - No she ain't 'cause I'd be the first one to know if she was. - How's that? - 'Cause she'd be playing around with me. (laughs) - It ain't funny, man. - Get this one, will you, L.A., I'm a little short on cash. (laughing) Jesus was a Capricorn but so is Nixon, now how you figure that? (country music) - Do you believe you're gonna go on after you die? Have you ever thought about it? - Yeah, I've thought about it. I don't know. - Do you want to hear my theory? Do you want to know what I think? - Sure, go ahead. - It's like there's this building, see, 'bout 25 stories up. - Okay. - Well I figure it's like at first we fall off the top of that building and it takes us about 65 years to go splat, you know, splat on the pavement? That's what I believe in, we're born falling and years later we finally hit the bottom and that's it.

Shit, all of a sudden we were in the middle of it, couldn't get out. We tried but we were pinned down. They were shooting at you like hail in a panhandle. - Kid was killed right in front of me. - What? - A little kid. Couldn't have been more than 14. Ran, saw daylight and ran for it. They shot him right through the chest with a riot gun, cut him in half. - Jesus. And killed him? - Right in front of me, five feet from me. Saw his eyes when he got hit. - And what did you see there in his eyes? - Terror. - You saw nothing else? - I saw terror, horror. He knew he was going to die. - but you must die before you can live, you know that. Hae you ever experienced your own death, any of you? - No. - You should try it some time. Once you do it, you eliminate the fear of death, the terror. Imagine that you have died. Let go of your body. Your body is lifeless, useless. You may cry if you feel it or scream or curse. Go with the feeling. Follow it to the limit, you no longer need to hide your feelings. Look at your body, look at the unloved one, the one that lies cold and alone, the one that has had no love. This is your chance to give warm and courage, to one who feels only cold, loneliness and death.

(gunfire blasting) - Oh no. - Stop him. - [Male] Get the God damn thing up. - [Female] Help me! Somebody get a doctor. Help! (crying) - [Reporter] Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. (Chris yelling) ♪ Your spirit is the mirror to my soul ♪ ♪ You are always with me ♪ ♪ And your love will never end ♪ ♪ And today I am with you once again ♪ ♪ You are my friend ♪ (sad music) (gunfire blasting) (sad music) - I need help. I won't lie. I can't say I want love. Right now I can only say I need help. I want help to make me say I want love. I need help from somebody. I want help that will make me will make me love, that will make me see a real need for other people. I just need help. I mean-- - [Merleen] You're gonna get it, Margaret. It's okay. - [Male] It's gonna be okay. - [Merleen] You loved your parents? - Very much. I didn't get to see much of my daddy 'cause he was a truck driver. He was away from home a lot. That gave me a little resentment I think 'cause he wasn't around to help me when I was growing up. - [Merleen] And you missed that? - Yeah, I missed that. - [Merleen] Did you resent it? - I did then. - [Merleen] Did you ever tell him? - No, I didn't. - [Merleen] Why? - I never got a chance. - [Merleen] If you had the chance to talk to him right now, what would you say to him? - I'd tell him how much I loved him. - [Merleen] Why don't you tell him? Why don't you talk to your dad right now? - I can't, he died. - [Merleen] You can still talk to him. - [Male] Chris, you can still tell him you loved him. - [Merleen] Did you ever tell him you loved him? - Yeah, I did. - [Merleen] Enough? - He heard me. - Did he ever say it back to you? - No. Well yes, he did. - But not like quite the way you wanted it, right? - I would've liked to have told him in person. See, I got back from Vietnam and I got off the bus and my mother was there and she told me that my father died two weeks before I got home. - [Merleen] Let it out. Let it out. (gentle music) - L.A. said you can't change anything. But you can, you can change yourself and then things around you begin to change because you're seeing them through new eyes, you understand? - I understand but to change yourself, Bubba, you've got to get into yourself. You've got to know who you are and where you're coming from. - I don't care about where I'm from. I want to know where I'm going. - Yeah. Hey, you want to help me shoot a little film about pyramids? - Pyramids? Far out. (swing squeaking) (gentle music) - Howdy, which one of you guys is Ken Russell? - Inside up here. - Thanks. Hi, you must be Mr. Russell? - [Ken] That's right. - [Chris] Here's my card. And this here's my director of photography, Bubba Lendberg. - Hi Bubba. - [Bubba] Hi. - Is this a cosmic deal or what? (banging) You must be into films? - That's right. And I'm really interested in what you do. - Well I build pyramids. You make films, I build pyramids. - Why are you building this one? - [Ken] We're gonna have a little gathering inside it, have an afternoon of music, watch the sun go down from inside the pyramid and have an evening meditation. - [Chris] How do pyramids affect human beings? - That's a good question. I hope you find out. We're composed of some of the same things that the animals are. We may be affected by our chemistry. It may in turn have an effect on our consciousness. - I see. Well, one of the reasons why I came down here is I'd like to do a documentary on it. - Great. What do you have in mind? - Well, we could start by filming this one. - All right. - Good. (gentle music) Dick Hogarty has worked this small strip of bottom land for 31 years. For Dick and the animals that share the ravine with him things are just about the same now as they were years ago. However, this morning, the commissioner's court upheld a ruling condemning the Hogarty hog haven as an eye sore and a health hazard to the community. What this means is he has slightly under 45 days to close down the haven and find another place to live or face the possibility of going to jail. Did you expect you were going to lose the decision when you first decided to fight the surrender to your property? - No, no, I, they should see that this place ain't no health hazard. The kids come down here after school, they love it. They pick wild berries right off the vine. That's the way we wanted it. Everybody in the neighborhood came down here one time or another with, like a park to 'em. - [Chris] Primarily it was the pigs. Some people say there's smell in the dirt. - Oh, pigs ain't dirty any more than any other animal, humans included. Just look at 'em over there. They got feelings to, you know? Some people just don't know that. (crying) - [Chris] Do you have any place in mind to go after you close down the hog haven? - No, no, I ain't worried much about that though. Wherever it is, it'll be the right place to be. Everything happens for a reason, you know? Like this place, it's been like a garden to me. I learned a lot about myself here. Watching the seasons and just sort of figure things out for yourself, you know? It's hard not to cry. Something's over and I really love this. That hurts. - That's horrible. Old man crying, it's making me ill for Christ'’s sake. Shut it off. Shut it off! I'll tell you the truth, I don't think people are gonna like that. - I do. - People don't mind seeing a broad cry but it doesn't look right to see a man cry like that. - But it's real, don't you see? It's more than just a movie, it's like being asked into another person's heart. - Who cares? I tell you it's a waste of time. - Listen to me, Willy, people want to see, you know I know people right? - Yeah, I know. - Okay, people want to see-- - People want to see stars screwing each other and shooting each other. I got to show a halfway decent film four times a day just to break even. Distributors, they want 80% of the God damn popcorn sale. What else you got there? - Nothing you'd be interested in, Willy. - Oh, I don't know, let's take a look. How 'bout something with broads or music? - Yeah. - Well what's that one? - That's a film about pyramids. - That's not right. I'd like to see something with broads or music in that one. - Okay. Here amigo, throw that one up for Mr. Easter here. - You're gonna like this one, Willy, I know that. I know that for sure. - Broads? - Broads and music. - Wonderful, wonderful. - Okay Ed, let her roll anytime. (upbeat music) What the hell is this? - All plants and animals, they have life, they also have soul, just like humans. We are also soul. We are eternal soul. (chanting and drumming) - When you breath in, let all this energy flow into your body and when you breath out, let all your anger go with it. - Okay. - [Dr. Moss] What you're looking at here is what we call kirlian photography. That's a special system of taking pictures without a camera or lens but sending an electrical current through, in this particular case, a finger pad. A finger pad belongs to a patient at UCLA. who's being treated by a healer who uses interestingly enough magnetic passes in his work. - Well Dr. Moss, you've been an actress, a wife, a mother, a psychologist, an author, a parapsychologist, now you're into kirlian photography. Can you tell us why that is? - Kirlian Photography poses a lot of challenge because you know in the esoteric literature, and I'm interested in parapsychology and that involves esoterica, they talk about an energy body that we consist certainly of physical stuff but beyond the physical stuff, there is something that emits energy from us and takes energy from the atmosphere and that this energy body probably makes us well or ill, certainly is used in psychic healing to give energy to somebody who's sick, make 'em better, and if this is so and kirlian photography captures it, it's going to revolutionize our concepts of physiology, medicine and the nature of the human being, and that's pretty important. I'm talking about a certain kind of energy that seems to be emitted by certain people who call themselves healers, and they are, to other people and the illness will disappear. Now with the psychic healer, how much is the belief in the patient that this man is going to make him better is a big question that we don't have any answer for. But let's say that we're working with belief and that belief and faith can heal. That's all we're saying. Faith healers have done a very good job since time immemorial. And we have been studying this phenomenon using kirlian photography and we see an interesting thing. We see that the emanations from the healer go toward the patient, the patient's emanations get brighter and the healer's get dimmer. So we think we're looking at an energy transfer. This becomes very exciting. I think most of science for the past couple of 100 years has been looking at our bones and sinews and all the material parts of man. I think all of the things we've just talked about are looking at the energetic and psychic aspects of man and I think that is where the future lies. - You know, there's a world we can see and a world we can't see, a world we can only feel. - [Edward] I believe we will discover that through consciousness, feelings and thoughts connect all living things. Actually, there is much work been done already to explore these subtle inner connections by people ranging from research scientists and medical doctors to ministers and students. In fact, some of the more interesting discoveries have been made by a man who is a lie detector expert. - Back in 1966, I attached one portion of the conventional polygraph to a plant leaf and found, much to my amazement, that I obtained a tracing that in many respects was similar to that of the human subject. This caused a lot of work to be done, as far as observations are concerned and structured experimentation and to date, we seem to feel, that a plant leaf has a capability of showing levels in the change of well being of other biological life forms in the laboratory area. It also seems to be able to show indications of changes as far as thought process as humans in the area of concern. One of the things I've constantly seen as far as the continuity of my research is concerned in the laboratory is an apparent oneness among all living things, whether it be the plants in the pots in the laboratory, the laboratory animals, bacteria, chicken eggs and so forth, that cause me to look a little bit toward books in Eastern philosophy where apparently for thousands of years they've been talking about the apparent oneness in the universe. - Did you ever read any Don Juan books? - Yes. - Journey to Ixtlan? - I believe there is magic, real magic, going on all the time all around us. I've been in places of power before. I felt vibrations like in the woods so strong I knew it was a power place for me. - I've felt that before. (mystical music) Did you feel that? - [Merleen] Mmhmm. - [Chris] I can feel my body slipping away. I'm free of my body. - [Merleen] Come on over, try this. (mystical music) (grunting) (laughing) Yes. (mystical music) (bell tolling) (mystical music) - Yeah, but we can change things. Things are changing anyway. - They're changing, I agree but they're getting worse. - Uh uh, they're getting better. - 20,000 years of recorded history and only 200 years of peace, what does that tell ya? - That we all ought to get our heads together. - It'll never happen. Don't be naive. - Don't be so sure. It's not good to be sure about anything. - Chris, you're beginning to sound like a-- - Shh, listen. - [Male] How long do you have to wait before you can get on the station? - It takes about four hours to go through your preparations and then if you're going to have some food or maybe take a little rest it might even take longer. - Can we look through the telescope? - Yes, we have a good object on, the planet Venus. - Can I have your autograph? - [Mitchell] Sure. - Excuse me, Captain Mitchell, hi Chris Lowe, I'm the filmmaker that got ahold of you. - Yes, I remember. - This is my assistant, Bubba Lemberg. - Hi Bubba. - There's several subjects I'd like to talk over with you concerning the documentary. - I'll be glad to and I think we can get some time here. Let me finish up with the children and we'll see if we can make some time, perhaps go around and have a talk. - Okay great. - Good, we'll see you in a few minutes. Oh I think most scientists these days have very much agreed that there has to be life on other planets but certainly within the galaxy or in other galaxies, there has to be intelligent life and even though we don't know how to reach it or contact it or how to even receive messages from it it certainly is there. - Captain Mitchell, Chris told me that during your flight in space you sent ESP messages back to Earth. Who received the messages? - Well, we had four subjects here in the United States that we worked with. It was a normal laboratory type experiment that's been conducted for at least 30 years but in this case, we took it into space. It's a very private-- - What's happening, captain? - Oh, they're just rotating the globe in preparation for tonight's astronomy. I think perhaps with all this noise we ought to go outside. - That'd be a good idea. Captain, at the Noetic Institute, you experimented with a man named Yuri Gulliver. Was he one of the men that you relayed messages to? - No, no, we didn't work with him on the space flight. I didn't even know him at that time. We worked with him later in the laboratory doing remote perceptions and telekinetic work and he's real and that but he also happens to be a performer. And that makes our job as scientists exceedingly difficult when he comes such a controversial character and is a performer as well. (mysterious music) - [Chris] Why do you put so much faith in science? - Science has always been investigating the unknown and providing new answers but without a value system, without the ethics, the morality that go with governing science, it can never solve anything. - Captain Mitchell, in my documentary, I'd like to show some kind of hope for humankind. - We like to think that there is a value system that we could all address and we would like to think that we could train people to understand that value system to agree upon it, to relate to themselves better, to relate to each other better and to the world in which we exist. But the real thing we must study is consciousness because we don't know what consciousness is. We don't know what it is that we human beings really are. That's the enigmatic question at the moment. Some of our better scientists seem to think that consciousness is the basic mind stuff, maybe the basic stuff of the universe behind all matter. I don't really know if that's true but it's a good assumption to start with. The real question with the dilemma of mankind at the moment is do we have time to evolve these things and to understand them and to utilize that information? We have to start now and we have to start with each individual working on himself to become a better human being. ♪ There are some men who see what is ♪ ♪ And ask why and what life brought ♪ ♪ Then there are some men ♪ ♪ Who see what's never been ♪ ♪ And ask why not ♪ ♪ History's course is changing ♪ ♪ The story can be told ♪ ♪ One of pioneers, new frontiers ♪ ♪ And the age of gold ♪ ♪ Secrets of the pyramid ♪ ♪ The little diamond sphinx ♪ ♪ The magic of the crucifix ♪ ♪ Tell 'em what you think ♪ ♪ Come on all of you pilgrims ♪ ♪ You strangers in this land ♪ ♪ Made for every one of us ♪ ♪ Come on, take a stand ♪ ♪ Come on, pilgrims ♪ ♪ Come on home now ♪ ♪ Everybody come on home ♪ ♪ Come on pilgrims ♪ ♪ Come on home ♪ ♪ Everybody ♪ ♪ Won't you come on home ♪ ♪ Come on pilgrims ♪ ♪ Come on home now ♪ ♪ Everybody, everybody, everybody won't you come on home ♪ ♪ The secrets of the pyramids ♪ ♪ Riddles of the sphinx ♪ ♪ The magic of the crucifix ♪ ♪ It's all in what you think ♪ ♪ Come home ♪ ♪ All of you pilgrims ♪ ♪ You strangers in this land ♪ ♪ The dawning of Aquarius ♪ ♪ Is made for every one of us ♪ ♪ Come on, take a stand ♪ ♪ Come on, come on, come on pilgrims ♪ ♪ Come on, come on home now ♪ ♪ Everybody, everybody come on home ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Come on pilgrims ♪
