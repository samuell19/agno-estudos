I can't believe it, Lil' Stitches! I've had my eye on the annual Halloween Dance Off all my life - and now, it's almost here! You mean, you've wanted to compete in the Halloween Dance Off for TWO HUNDRED YEARS, Lil' Fangs?! A hundred and eighty-seven years, to be exact, thank you very much! Ah...my bad. I can't believe it's almost Halloween! The days go by so fast when you get to be my age! It's all such a blur! To think, you'll be a hundred and eighty-eight before you know it! That's right! A hundred and eighty-eight year old CHAMPION! I can't wait to get up on that bright stage and see everyone looking back at me! All those faces! All those eyes! All those tentacles! I don't like being the center of attention! Don't you think you'll get a lil' stage fright up there, Lil' Fangs? Stage fright? Pfft! No way! I'm a mini-vampire! You know what happens when folks look at me too long? They notice your pallid complexion? No! They fall into a deep trance, and do my bidding! Oh, right! Hey, do you think you can pull that trick on the dance judges? Sure! But, I'm not gonna! No? Why not, Lil' Fangs? Because! That would be CHEATING! And little vampires don't cheat! They don't? Nope! Don't have to! We're good enough, smart enough, strong enough, and spooky enough to do just fine as it is! Do you think you'll win?! I'm gonna try! Either way, it's gonna be fun seeing who IS this year's best dancer! I can do a pretty mean robot! I'll bet! And I can't wait to see it! I wanna get everyone else involved too! Whatcha mean, Lil' Fangs? I mean, I'm starting a Monster Dance Club at school, so that any lil' monster who wants to get down can participate in the dance competition! Really?! Wow! Any monsters at all? You mean...even I can enter?! Why not?! The Dance Off is open to one and all, isn't it? Hmm. Yeah, I guess it is! So, what are you waiting for, Lil' Stitches? Start practicing your moves and get ready! There's no time like the present! Okay! I need to do some stretches, or something! My bones are stiff! When we go to school tomorrow, I'm gonna announce to all our lil' friends that we're holding open auditions for the Dance Off! Then, we'll see who's interested in trying out, and pick the best of the best to perform onstage! Okay! I can't wait! Hey, do you think I need to get a snappy new outfit to dance in? Or will this old get-up do? I dunno! You've worn that outfit since the day I met you, Lil' Stitches! I can't even picture you wearing anything else! My gram has some glittery, sequined capes and stuff, leftover from her glam Egyptian days! I could wear that! Don't get yourself into trouble, buddy! What if you get it dirty? Or tear it? I don't want to see you get GROUNDED before the Dance Off! You're right! It's not worth it! Besides, if I'm a good enough dancer, I'll let my moves do the talking! That's the spirit! I can't wait! C'mon, let's get ready for bed! Bed?! But, it's six o'clock in the morning! I'm a little vampire, don't you know we need our daytime nap? I wanna be good and rested for tomorrow! It's gonna be a BIG day! Okay, everybody! Thanks for coming in early! Before Mrs. Myers gets here, Lil' Stitches and I have something very exciting to announce! That's right! Does it have anything to do with jerky treats? Umm...no, Lil' Woof, Nothing about jerky treats! Oh. What about bubbling cauldrons? Is it about a bubbling cauldron? No, Lil' Charm, I'm afraid it's got nothing to do with any bubbling cauldrons either! Dang! I know! We're in school! This must be about BRAAAIIINS! Uh, no. No, Lil' Brains, we're not gonna talk about brains today! Nope! We're gonna dance! Dance? Whatcha guys mean? I mean, as we all know, the big Halloween Dance Off is fast approaching! Not as fast as my dad! My dad moves fast! Whoosh! Yikes! Easy, Lil' Boo, easy! Now's not the time for collecting souls - now's the time to DANCE OUR SOCKS OFF! Umm...that's gonna be kinda tough for me, guys. Not literally, Lil' Rags! I just mean we're all gonna show off our best dance moves, and assemble our very own Monster Dance Club! Then, on Dance Off day, we'll get onstage and blow the doors off the joint! Ah! Destruction! I like it! Lil' Stitches! Hit the music! Okay! One at a time now! Each of you have a moment on the floor, to bust out your favorite dance moves! At the end, we'll pick the best ones for our new team! And we'll go WIN that thing! Yeah! Ladies first, Lil' Charm! You're up! Oh, my! I didn't come to school today prepared for THIS! But, okay! Here goes! Woohoo! Niiice! Lil' Charm you're amazing! Lil' Jackie! Do your thing, vegeta-girl! Okay! I'm not much of a dancer, but... here goes nothin'! Awesome, Jackie! Yeah! What a twist! That was really good! Aww, shucks, you guys! I'm next! I'm next! Uhh...okay. Yay, Lil' Brains! Woohoo! Huh! That's pretty good! You wanna see pretty good? I'll show you guys pretty good! Watch this! I call it Werewolf Risin'! Wooo! Lil' Woof's got moves! I learned this one back home! We used to bust it out at the pyramids when I was little! I mean, I'm STILL little, but... you get the idea! Wow! Nice! Yeah! Smooth moves, Lil' Rags! Thanks! Lil' Boo, it's all you! I thought you'd never ask! Go, Lil' Boo! It's your birthday! Go, Lil' Boo! It's your birthday! That was super, Lil' Boo! Sure was! It was phan-tastic! What about you, Lil' Stitches? You gonna show us whatcha got?! I sure am, Lil' Charm! Excuse me, while I drop some science! Whoa, buddy! I didn't know you could move like that! It's all in the joints! What about you, Lil' Fangs! Let's see you! Yeah! Hit us with your best shot! Dance away! Okay, kids! You asked for it! Yayyy, Lil' Fangs! Well? What'd you guys think? Smooth as butter! Smart as braaaiiins! I think we have our Halloween Dance Club - EVERYBODY! Yes! Listen! Everyone here's so good, you ALL made the cut! Cut? Did somebody say cut? Yikes! I just can't wait for that Halloween Dance Off, Lil' Rags! It's gonna be sooo fun! No doubt, Lil' Jackie! To be honest, I never saw myself dancing onstage! But, ever since Lil' Fangs and Lil' Stitches said I made the cut, I'm pretty excited about it! I know, right? I usually save my silliest dance moves for the bedroom mirror at home - but, now I'm thinking what the hay?! Why not let it all hang out?! Go for broke?! Let my freak flag fly! I just wish we had more time to get together and practice! We were good today, but who knows how good we could be, if we had more time to prepare! Hmm...you're right! Y'know, tomorrow's Mischief Night! The night all lil' ghosts and ghoulies hit the town for some fun frights! Or, hunker down to roast marshmallows all through the night! Why don't we plan a big, fun and music-filled sleepover?! A sleepover?! Yeah! We could invite the whole gang! Yesss! And do run-throughs of the performances we wanna do in the Halloween Dance Off! Absolutely! Think the gang'll go for it?! There's only one way to find out - we'll ask around! Sweet! Lil' Fangs and Lil' Woof are in my gym class next! I'll invite them! Okay! And the rest of the gang are in my history class! I'm headed there now! We can meet on the playground after school, and see who's in or who's out! Sounds good! What a day this has been, Lil' Rags! And it's only getting better, Lil' Jackie! True that! Good luck with Lil' Fangs and Lil' Woof! The proper term is 'break a leg'! Oh, right! At least, you're already bandaged for it! Hahaha! Hahaha! Thanks for inviting us to your sleepover, Lil' Jackie! Yeah! What a fun activity on this night-of-all-nights - Mischief Night! No worries, guys! Lil' Rags and I were talking after our surprise dance auditions today, and we thought it'd be fun to get together in a big sleepover, and do more planning! We're glad you all could make it! Are you kidding? We wouldn't miss it! That's right! All of us together? On Mischief Night?! What could be better than that? I can only think of ONE thing! You can? You can? What's that, Lil' Fangs? Telling our favorite Halloween stories! Whoa! That WOULD be fun! Uhhh...could be make sure the windows are locked first? It could get spooky in here! Hahaha! Okay, Lil' Stitches! We'll make sure we're locked up tight! Who wants to go first? How about Lil' Fangs? It was his idea! Yeah! Let's hear one, Lil' Fangs! Very well, then! Once upon a time, when I was just a wee vampire, I heard a loud scratching on my coffin lid! Oh, no! What'd you do, Lil' Fangs?! Well...I froze for a moment. I wasn't sure if I should open the lid! Are you kidding? I'd have padlocked it from the inside! Yeah! Scratching? On a coffin lid? In the middle of the night? Huh-uh! No way! It was actually the middle of the DAY, Jackie! Ohhh, right! You are a lil' vampire! Day is night, night is day! Gotcha! Right! So anyway, I finally decided to open my coffin and see who was making that terrible racket, while I was trying so hard to sleep! Who was it, Fangs? Who was doing the scratching? Fluffy! Fluffy? Yes, Fluffy! Our pet cat! She loved to curl up with me in my cozy coffin bed! Ohhh! That makes sense! Kitties are so cuddly! And they love a warm bed! Or coffin! What about you, Lil' Charm? You're a witch! You must have a black cat story or two! I do, indeed! But, I'd rather tell a broom story! A broom story! I'm all ears! And... braaaiiins! I see that, Lil' Brains! So, one Halloween, I was flying my broom over the countryside, watching all the trick-or-treaters, and I came upon a lonely farmhouse, sitting all alone on a hilltop! Aww...poor farmhouse! It's just a figure of speech, Lil' Boo! Houses don't get lonely! Oh. Right. So, I landed and met a little old lady who was having a terrible time cleaning up a mess after a stray wolf got into her pantry! Pfft! Blame the wolf! I see how it is! What did you do, Lil' Charm? Did you help the old lady? I did! I hopped off my broom and used it to help sweep up her pantry floor! Then, we put all the stuff back in its crates! She was so thankful, she baked me a homemade cherry pie to take home with me! Wow! That story had a nice happy ending! It sure did! I wonder if they ever caught that wolf! You would! But, I can tell ya, they NEVER catch the wolf! 'Cause wolves are too smart to get caught! How 'bout that? Sounds like you have a Halloween story to tell, Lil' Woof! I might! Halloween's given me some of my favorite memories! Like this one time, I was huffing and puffing, trying my best to blow this house down! Gee, I wonder why you were suspected of breaking into that old lady's pantry! Anyway! If you'll listen, I'll finish! I was helping the farmer raze his barn, so he could build a bigger one, to hold more cows and pigs! How nice of you, Lil' Woof! See what I mean? Us wolves ain't all bad! When I finally took a deep enough breath and DID blow his house down, he gave me all the Halloween candy I could carry! No way! Yes way! And boy, was that farm stocked up with candy! I was the most popular wolf in my den that year, lemme tell ya what! Wow! I bet! What about you, Lil' Rags? Any fun Halloween tales? I have a few! Like this one time, I was trick-or-treating downtown, and-- Whoa! Trick-or-treating downtown? My mom won't let me do that! There was a big group of us! Ohh, that musta been so fun! It was! Anyway, we trick-or-treated at the hospital, and wouldn't you know it, the nurses thought I was a patient who'd wandered out of his room upstairs! Ha! Get out! What happened? They whisked me off to a room and threw me in a bed! Then, some doctor came in and scolded me, like, young man, don't you ever do that again! You could hurt yourself even worse! Hahaha! That's crazy! We got it sorted out! And when they realized their mistake, they took me back downstairs and let me and all my friends raid their candy bowls! That's awesome! Gosh, if we find ourselves in the right places, us lil' monsters can really clean up on Halloween! I know, right? How 'bout you, Boo? Any good Halloween stories to share? Oh, I have loads of stories! Halloween's my time of year! But, rather than spinning yarns, I have something else in mind! Like what, Lil' Boo? Like this! Wowwwwww! Go, Boo-Boo, go Boo-Boo, go! Woot! Woot! Woot! Wooo! That reaper can DANCE! Greetings, lil' monsters and creatures of all walks and wings! I bid you...welcome! I hope that you are ready for another fun-filled evening of footwork and wing-flapping! For, today is the day we've ALL awaited! The annual Halloween Dance Off is upon us! Without further ado, let me present our first contestants! If you enjoy night stalking, you might know their footprints! All the way from the dark shadows - LIL' RAGS and LIL' BRAINS! Hey, Fritz! Gimme a vanilla double scoop sprinkled with candy corn! I'm all outta candy corn, Lil' Woof! Sorry! What?! All outta candy corn? But, today's HALLOWEEN! Who runs outta candy corn on Halloween, for howling out loud?! Well...I guess I do! It's okay, Lil' Woof! Try saltwater taffy sprinkles instead! They're yummy! Oops! I just ran outta taffy, too! You ran outta TAFFY?! On Halloween?! Oh boy! Very nice, you two! Where in the night did you learn such deft synchronization? Uhhh...what? What's the sink running nation? I bet their water bill's sky high! Ehhh... ...nice job, you two! Everybody give them a hand! Give them a wing! What talent! Okay, okay! Let's see...I got it! Lemme have a large cup of carnivore berry, with chocolate drizzle on top! I don't carry carnivore berry, Lil' Woof. You don't carry carnivore berry?! Oh no! I was looking forward to carnivore berry this Halloween! Hey, Lil' Woof! We're next! Alright! Next up, we have an unlikely duo! One savage from the deep woods - you may have heard him howling at the moon last Wednesday - and the other, a lil' cutie from the pumpkin patch! The pumpkin patch right over there, actually! We've all watched her grow up from a lil' seed sprout! Give a blood-warm Halloween welcome to two of our local honor students, LIL' JACKIE and LIL' WOOF! You don't carry blood-orange ice pops? Any ice cream truck worth its chocolate carries blood-orange ice pops! Lil' Woof... I come here for ice cream every Halloween, and I've ALWAYS gotten blood-orange ice pops! Waa! I wanna blood-orange ice pops! What about some chocolate candy corn? Nooo! I want blood-orange ice pops! Lil' Woof-- Sniff, sniff, what Boo?! They just announced your name onstage! You're up! Oh...uhhh... I'll be back! I hope you have some eyeballs gummies! Sorry 'bout that, Fritz. He loves his ice cream! Pfft! Temper on that wolf! For a minute, I was starting to think you got cold feet! Me? Cold feet? Pfft! My feet are always warm and fuzzy! Hit the music! Look at 'em go up there, Lil' Brains! Y'know, I've known Jackie all my life, and I never knew she could dance like that! I knew Lil' Woof could move! You oughta see him chase his rabbit pals in the woods! Hoo-wee! What a sight! I can imagine! I dressed up like a wolf one year, but I sure didn't have wolf speed! Wait, you mean, you were born a lil' witch, but you still dressed up for Halloween? I ALWAYS dress up for Halloween! I was gonna be Bigfoot this year, but we ended up entering this Dance Off instead! You mean, you dress up EVERY year? Yep! Every single one! Wow! What are some of your favorite costumes?! Hmm..let's see... I went as an angel one time! Ha! A witch dressed as an angel?! Priceless! One year, I was a cat! Black one, of course! Yup! Once, I was a princess! Really? Aw, that's cute! And last year, I was a wet mop! A wet mop?! Yeah. I just dumped a bucket of water over my head and held onto my broom! Wow! How about that? Let 'em hear it! Have you ever seen a no-hands cartwheel like that? I haven't! Let's have a word with the dancers, shall we? Come here, you two! Come...here! Where did you lil' monsters learn to get down like that? How did you develop such great chemistry? Well, we had a sleepover at my house on Mischief Night, and we practiced some steps! A sleepover on Mischief Night! Hahaha! Incredible! Some performers take years to achieve that kind of chemistry! I'm a dog of prey! I'm naturally physical and very communicative! Clearly! You know, I absolutely LOVE transforming into a wolf on Halloween... or any other time, for that matter. A pumpkin too? That goes without saying! Pumpkins are what Halloween is all about! It sounds like Jackie and Woof knocked 'em dead! You think I oughta practice MY moves before I take the stage, Lil' Brains? Right here? With me? But, we're not even a team! We're competing AGAINST each other! Duh! I know, silly! But, we're still friends! We can still have fun dancing together! Won't that be giving away your ideas, Lil' Charm? What if someone sees, and then goes up and copies you? And then later, when it's your turn, it looks like YOU'RE copying THEM?! I don't need to run through my stage dance if you don't think it's a good idea - we can just dance to limber up Uhhh...limber up? What's that? It's when we warm-up for an exercise - like dancing, silly! Oh. I knew that. My name is Lil' Brain, but I'm very smart! Uh-huh. Suuuure you did! Okay, I'll start! You ready?! Ready as I'll ever be! Okay! Here goes! What do you think, Lil' Brains? Do I have the moves? I'll say! My back's getting stiff just watching you! Don't just stand there like a zombie! Gimme something to work with! C'mon! Dance! Okay, okay...lemme limber up first! Go Lil' Brains, go, Lil' Brains, go! Okay, I'm going! Going, going, gone! Lil' Brains... why didn't you do that onstage?! Meh! It's just a lil' something I do for fun around the crypt! Wow. Alright, Fritz! I've done my dancing for the day, now I want some ice cream! Well, that's why I'm here in this ice cream truck, Lil' Woof! Pick your treat! How about blood-orange ice pop? Lil' Woof! I don't have blood-orange ice pop! How about a cup of plain old vanilla, Lil' Woof? There's always vanilla! Vanilla?! Ptooey! I don't eat no yucky vanilla! C'mon, Lil' Woof, why don't I sprinkle some doggie biscuits on top, give it some flash? Doggie biscuits? Did you say doggie biscuits? What do I look like, a German Shepherd? I'm a WOLF! A WEREWOLF! Unbelievable! I'm telling ya, I get no respect! Let's hear it for Chicky-Peep, everybody! Chicky-Peep! How fleet-of-foot! Such fluttering wings! Now, that was a clucking incredible performance! A chick of few words, I see! That's okay, it keeps our show moving along nicely! Nobody likes a long-winded bird! Up next, we have quite a surprising entrant! This lil' lady is usually found underfoot - and what a STING she delivers when we step down! Who knew she could boogie, too?! All the way from her anthill on the prairie highlands, it's my pleasure to introduce to you, the lovely OLIVE! Come on up here and show us what you've got, OLIVE! Okay, I think I'm ready! It's crazy how nervous I get whenever it's time to go onstage! I thought lil' witches liked being the center of attention? Not THIS lil' witch! I'm just a shy girl at heart! Aww, that's sweet, Lil' Charm! I bet you're gonna be great! Thank you, that's very sweet! Well, don't be nervous, Lil' Charm! Think happy thoughts! Right! Happy thoughts! Smiling judges! High scores! Everybody happy! Clapping! Cheering! For me! Yes! That's the spirit, Lil' Charm! Well, well! That performance was RED-HOT! Hahaha! Pun intended! Such leg coordination! And those synchronized antenna moves! Simply dazzling! Where in the world did you develop such talent, Olive? Olive? Hehe! Well, it appears as though lil' Olive has a bad case of stage fright! It happens to the best of us! Well, not to ME! I only GIVE frights, I never receive! You get the idea! Next up, we have a rather intriguing duo from right here in town! Please give a gushing welcome to LIL' BOO and LIL' CHARM! Hey, it's your turn! You're up, Lil' Charm! Oh, boy! What did I get myself into? I'm no dancer! Sure you are! Look at me! I'm stiff as a board, and I got up there! But, you also have some natural rhythm and ability! All I do is ride a broom around and practice my cackle! Then use those things! Play to your strengths, Lil' Charm! Good idea, Lil' Brains! Don't worry! You'll be fine! C'mon! I'll walk you to the stage! Lil' Boo's probably worried you're gonna run out on him! Okay, okay, let's go, before I lose my nerve! Lil' Fangs! I have bad news! Bad news?! Whattaya mean, bad news?! They haven't judged the competition yet! The Halloween Dance Off is still underway! You could still win, Rags! No, no, it's not that! It's Lil' Stitches! Lil' Stitches?! What about him? He's GONE! Gone?! But...Stitches and I are performing together! If he's gone...then I have no dance partner! And no chance of achieving my dream of winning the Halloween Dance Off! I know, Fangs! But, they just saw Stitches running down the street! He said he couldn't stand the pressure and was going back home! I'm sorry, Fangs! It's okay, Rags! Thank you for telling me! What are you gonna do? The only thing I CAN do, Rags! I'm gonna go get Stitches and bring him back! Do you need help? I've already danced, I can come with you! No, I don't wanna spook him! Stitches can be real sensitive, you know? Yeah, I know! He once locked himself in the laboratory for a whole afternoon, after we were playing a game and he couldn't reach the blue circle with his foot! That sounds like Lil' Stitches! I'm gonna go home and see if he's there! If I'm not back by stage time, you and the lil' gang try and stall Dracula, okay? Okay! Good luck, Lil' Fangs! Thanks, Lil' Rags! I'm gonna need it! Where's your dance partner, little monster? I dunno, Drac! She was supposed to be here! Do you have anyone who can be a last-minute replacement? I'd hate to have to disqualify you! Ummm... Here I am! Sorry I straggled! Whew! I was starting to think you'd abandoned me, Lil' Charm! And so was I! In a hundred and seventy-two Halloween Dance Offs, I've NEVER had to disqualify a single competitor! 'Twould have been a shame to start now! Totally! Well...looks like we're all set! Yep! On that note - take it away, lil' dancers! Let's do this! And-a-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four! What in the world was I thinking?! I can't dance! I don't even wanna dance! I'm a Frankenstein monster! I stand ominously. I glower. I lumber. It's just not worth it. There you are, Li'l Stitches. What's going on? Why did you leave without saying anything? I'm sorry, Lil' Fangs...I didn't wanna embarrass you, or ruin your shot in the Dance Off...so, I thought it'd be best if I just snuck out! But, you're my partner, Stitches! You should've said something! I know, I know...I just couldn't bring myself to face you. Aww, Stitches...we're buddies! Pals! We've been through thick and thin! If you need a shoulder to lean on, I'm always here! But, I'd smash you, Fangs! I don't know my own strength, remember? Oh. Right. There's that. - -so, I just went along with the whole dancing thing, because you wanted to win the Halloween Dance Off competition so bad, Lil' Fangs! I never thought I could impress anybody by dancing! Heck, I'd probably scare 'em all away, just like I used to do in nursery school! Nursery school was a long time ago, Stitches! It was last year. Oh...yeah. My sense of time's been all messed up, ever since I turned one hundred! That's understandable. Our brains can only hold so much! And I should know - I've had THREE brain transplants! But, three brain transplants can hold a lotta dance knowledge, Stitches! Are you sure you don't have some moves in you somewhere? Just enough to get us through ONE performance? Why don't you tell me? I'll show you what I can do, and you let me know if you still want me to be your partner in the Dance Off? Deal? Deal! Be honest! I will! Okay, here goes. Don't sing it! Bring it! Don't worry! You DEFINITELY don't wanna hear my singing voice! WOW! Whew! Looks like we made it just in time, Lil' Stitches! I think these guys are the last performers before we go on! Then it's OUR turn to show 'em what we've got! Great. I hope you're right about this, Lil' Fangs...and I hope I don't let you down. Trust me, buddy! Besides, we're only dancing! What can go wrong? There you are, Lil' Fangs! Where have you been hiding, my boy? I wasn't hiding! I've been here the whole time, pop! Pop? Wait...you mean, Dracula's your...your DAD?! Shh! Don't say that too loud, Lil' Stitches! It's a secret! I'll say! I've known you my whole life, and I never knew! Listen! We have to keep it hush-hush, especially since I'm competing onstage today! Indeed! If the judges find out, my Lil' Fangs risks disqualification, before he even steps foot onstage! So, then...is the Halloween Dance Off FIXED? Are you gonna win just for dancing, Lil' Fangs? Because your dad's the host? Are you kidding?! No! Pop doesn't give me anything I don't work my fangs off for! That's right! My boy has to work like everybody else to achieve his goals! In fact, he must work even HARDER to prove himself! See what I mean? I've never even publicly revealed that we're related - although the resemblance is rather striking, don't you think, Lil' Stitches? Such a handsome lil' vampire, my Fangs is! I don't believe it! This blows my mind! I'm gonna need a FOURTH brain transplant after learning this! Four brain transplants?! Ouch! This is crazy! It's like if I competed in the school science fair with MY dad - Dr. Frankenstein! Talk about an unfair advantage! Tell your dad I said hello, Stitches! Will do, Count! From one horror icon to another! Hey look, pop! I think the dancers are wrapping up! Ah, yes! Time to go to work, boys! I need some blood orange tea when the show's over - I think I'm starting to lose my voice! We'll try to be quick about it! Yes, please! Break a leg up there, boys... and if it bleeds, you know who to call first! Gotcha. Gimme a break, dad. Splendid! Simply splendid, both of you! What a crop of choreographed contestants we've had this year! Just outstanding! And now, without any further ado, here's an amazingly-talented duo from beyond the grave! Utterly spectacular, I tell you! I thought we were gonna be low-key! What's your dad doing, Lil' Fangs?! Shh, Stitches! He's not my dad, remember? Oh, okay! That vampire up there who LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE YOU! I don't need any more pressure on me for this, okay?! I'm already so nervous, I feel like my bolts are gonna rattle right out! Relax, Stitches! Just breathe and follow my lead! Everything'll be just fine! Famous last words! Here they are, in the flesh - and what interesting colors those flesh tones are - LIL' STITCHES and LIL' FAAAAAAANGS! Woohoo! Go get 'em, guys! Knock 'em dead! Wow, what moves that Li'l Stitches has! Who knew? Not me! You know, these guys could run away with this contest. They could win it all! You think so? Oh, I'd be so happy for them, Rags! What about you? Don't you want the judges to pick you? Don't you want to win? Meh! Winning's overrated! This whole week's been super fun! Planning, practicing, and rehearsing with my friends?! That's the best! It's the experiences that count! Did you say Count? You did it Stitches! You did it! We did it, Fangs! My goodness! My medallion is fogged! What a performance! These two are gonna be a tough act to beat, lemme tell you! I understand the judges tallies are in! That's record time! Ladies, gentlemen, and lil' monsters alike - WE HAVE A WINNER! Yikes! I did my best! Good luck, Fangs! Break a leg, Stitches! It's bad luck to say good luck! Oh! Right! And the winner of the 2019 Halloween Dance Off competition is... ...MITTENS! Uh...Mittens? Er, um...you're Mittens? I don't remember seeing that reindeer dance. Me, neither. I don't believe what I'm seeing! Was the Halloween Dance Off just won by a Christmas reindeer? I don't seem to remember seeing you dance, lil' reindeer! Nor do any of our audience members here today! Would you care to refresh our memories?
