(intense music) (upbeat music) (eerie music) Master, everything is prepared for you. (laughing) Greetings to our master. [All] Master. (laughing) Today is the 20th anniversary of our ninja empire. As our top fighters, you're here to witness the empire's supreme power. (mystical music) (groaning) All right, you may start now. [Man] Yes, Master. (grunting) (laughing) If you don't believe it, why don't you try it? Master, let me try. (mystical music) Master. (metal clanging) (laughing) Supreme ninja. (laughing) [All] Master, our supreme ninja. Supreme ninja. (suspenseful music) (grunting) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (hissing) (grunting) [Man] Come on. (suspenseful music) (grunting) [Man] Huh? Master, the Golden Ninja Warrior is gone. What's that, who did it? [Man] Harry, Baron, and Tomashi. They killed all the guards and they got away. Spread the news, get the Golden Ninja Warrior back. As for the traitors, make sure they're killed. Yes, Master. (mystical music) (groaning) (intense music) Ecaza, I don't know what, I don't know what we're gonna do without Tomashi. It, it, it just doesn't seem fair. Why did God do this to us? Hey. Machico, my sister, don't worry. We'll always remember Tomashi as the wonderful person and brother that he was to us. May God rest his soul. But Machico, I'm bothered, bothered by his death. It seems so strange. This whole thing is damn suspicious, Machico. Do you think our brother was hiding something, something illegal that we didn't know about? Like drugs or smuggling or maybe even triad activity? I mean, why would anyone wanna get rid of Tomashi? And then get evidence to show that he was murdered? It just doesn't make any sense at all, does it? The police say that he was found with pieces of metal in his back. That definitely means somebody wanted him dead. It's so strange. Come, Machico. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to upset you. But I have to find out what happened. For Tomashi's sake. And for the sake of our family. You understand? Boss, the purchase of the smuggled merchandise is all arranged with the Thai dealer. [Boss] Well done, Tiger, that's great. Carry on as we planned. Yes, as soon as the stuff arrives, I'll inform our new client, and we will go ahead with the exchange as planned. [Boss] Very good, now what about Tomashi? All we know is he was found dead under suspicious circumstances. Only the complete Golden Ninja Warrior can gave me supreme power, and you must get me the body from Tomashi. I believe he left it to his brother Ecaza and his sister Machico. Force them to hand it over. [Tiger] Now listen, you have a very important mission ahead of you. You are to search out Tomashi's brother Ecaza and his sister Machico who are believed to be in possession of the body of the Golden Ninja Warrior. [Victor] I understand, sir. Bring me the body of that Golden Ninja Warrior. And if the brother or sister offer any resistance, you must kill them without any hesitation. Do you understand me? I got it, sir. (suspenseful music) Hey, Ecaza, let's get out of here and check the view. Ah, great idea. (suspenseful music) Now where are they meeting us? Oh, not far from here, what time is it? Uh, it's about three o'clock, no hurry. (gun firing) (grunting) (upbeat music) (intense music) What are we eating tonight, darling? It's your favorite dish. Steamed crabs? No, this time I'm preparing a really special dish, something called drunken crab, and I know you're gonna love it. What is that? Hang on in there, you'll find out. (screaming) The crabs have escaped! Quickly, come and help! Hey, Alfred, any news? Hi, Jaguar, yeah, listen, I just heard Tomashi's brother. Ecaza was just killed this morning. - Huh? - Yeah. Well, that's too bad. Thanks anyway. [Alfred] Ciao. (phone ringing) [Jaguar] Can I speak to Harry McQueen, please? Yeah, speaking, who is it? It's Jaguar Wong here, listen, Harry, Ecaza's been killed, looks like Tiger Chan's work. That's really bad, but what about his sister? She's okay, but those bastards, they're just animals. You just can't tell what they're gonna do next. I know, but we must protect her if I'm gonna get back the Golden Ninja Warrior. She's the only lead. Okay, Harry, count on it. I'll make sure they don't get her. I'll go to her restaurant this afternoon and find out what I can, bye. (disco music) Hey, excuse me, I'm looking for a restaurant run by a girl called Machico. [Man] So what's the name of this place? The Yat Chuen Restaurant. [Man] What's his problem? Well, I'm looking for a restaurant. You're looking in the wrong place, around here, there ain't no restaurants, buddy. (grunting) (whimpering) (grunting) Okay, smart ass, where's the restaurant? Over there, over there. (gentle piano music) (clearing throat) Excuse me, sir, can I help you? Would you like to order something? Yeah, but it's not on the menu. I'm sorry, sir, would you like to check again? Is Machico on it? Uh... Over here, I'm Machico. I'm very sorry to hear about the death of your two brothers. But have you heard the story of the Golden Ninja Warrior? I don't know what you're talking about. Come on, don't fool around. I'm warning you, listen, you could be in danger. I don't know what you're talking about and I don't like being threatened. I'm not threatening you. I'm trying to help. (dramatic music) Victor, Jaguar Wong is Harry's accomplice, and he's interfering in our affairs. I want you to get him before he gets his hands on the Golden Ninja Warrior. [Victor] Yes, sir. Hey, I'm sorry. Hey, hey, you Jaguar Wong? (chuckles) Hey, you're acting pretty cool, man. But it's guys like you need to be shown a good lesson. Oh. And you think you're the one who's gonna show me? That's right, let's see those famous Jaguar skills. (chuckles) You flatter me. (grunting) (yelling) (grunting) (groaning) You okay? Now you've had a taste of my Jaguar technique. - Yeah. - Uh-huh. Now I've got something to tell you, pair of weaklings. Since you're both Tiger Chan's men, you'll take a message for me, right? - Right, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, bye. Hey, wait, you don't know what the message is. Tell him to keep away from Machico. Yeah. Tell him he can forget the body of the Golden Ninja. (suspenseful music) (whistling) (intense music) (swords clanging) (grunting) (dramatic music) (yelling) (grunting) You! (grunting) (ripping) God damn you. (yelling) (whimpering) You're an improvement on the last two jerks. But you're still not good enough. Yeah, you're the best, you're really the best. Jaguar Wong is afraid of nothing. Go back and tell your boss to keep his hands off the Golden Ninja Warrior unless he wants to meddle with me. (groaning) Wait a minute. Uh, no. No! (chuckles) Please, give it back. A ring for a coat, I think that's pretty fair. Oh! Get moving. - Yes. - Go on! All right. (upbeat music) (suspenseful music) (hissing) (suspenseful music) [Clerk] Good day, sir. [Jaguar] I've got a ring I want to sell. Oh, do you? [Jaguar] It's gotta be ruby. It must be worth quite a lot. What are you gonna give me for it? Hmm. You see, this ring's been in my family for years. I'm sure it's worth quite a lot of money. [Clerk] I'm sorry, sir, it's fake. You mean it's worth nothing? Well, this sort of ring only comes from a box of Cracker Jacks. I'm afraid it's worthless, sir. Well, thanks for your time. No problem. And since I can't buy my new coat with it, I'll leave it with you. Good day. (upbeat music) Try this. (upbeat music) (car engine roaring) (upbeat music) (tires squealing) (upbeat music) (tires squealing) What the hell are you doing, you damn jerk? You don't remember me? (chuckles) Lily, you never could quite fool me, could you? We were over a long time ago. Come on, Lily, I don't believe that you really feel that way. You remember how we felt about each other? My feelings haven't changed, and I bet yours haven't either. Look at me! (Lily whimpering) (gentle music) (moaning) Jaguar, I'm afraid we can't meet again. Why not? There's another man in my life now. Well, I'd expect that by now. This is different. Tiger's right-hand man. It's Victor Li. (intense music) (swords clanging) (grunting) Your technique is still very good. And so is yours. You must stop your man from annoying Tomashi's sister. If you stop yours first. You want the Golden Ninja Warrior all for yourself. Look at this. Yes, that's my ninja star. Right, it's my ninja star. This is yours. (mystical music) Why are you so greedy? Because there's not enough for everyone. Only the complete Golden Ninja Warrior can give us the supreme power. There's only one person who has our ninja stars. You mean Yematol? He's coming after us, he may have got the body of the Golden Ninja Warrior from Tomashi. The triangular force will exist no more. The Ninja Empire will destroy us. We will all be destroyed. Unless we destroy them first! (airplane engine roaring) (upbeat music) Tell me the story. Yes, since we received instructions from the Ninja Empire, we set about recovering the Golden Ninja Warrior. We did this by investigating the three traitors. I traced Tomashi's hideout and discovered him practicing the supreme ninja technique. (swords clanging) (groaning) I killed him before he was able to create the supreme ninja spirit. (upbeat music) And here is the body of the Golden Ninja Warrior. [Man] Good, Karata. (intense music) (suspenseful music) If you can deal with our four dragons you're really tough. (dramatic music) (grunting) (groaning) That ring you brought into my shop didn't belong to you. It belonged to my brother, and I'm here to take revenge now. (yelling) (grunting) (chuckles) You give up? (whimpering) (upbeat music) (doorbell buzzing) (hissing) (grunting) (robot beeping) [Robot] Traitor, listen. You have just three days to return the Golden Ninja Warrior to our master. Hear and obey. (phone ringing) Listen to me. Traitor, I believe that you've received a death message from our Ninja Empire. Ninja is supreme and you have double crossed it. Why did you do that? The Ninja Empire is evil. I have to reform the Ninja Empire. That is why I took away the Golden Ninja Warrior. You've got three days in which to return the Golden Ninja Warrior, or else you die. Go to hell. (upbeat music) You got it? (upbeat music) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (glass shattering) (grunting) (bones cracking) (whimpering) (grunting) (groaning) (car engine roaring) Move it! (groaning) Okay, jerk, I need some fast answers to some questions. So tell me. Who's your boss? Did you hear me, where did this stuff come from? (whimpering) Look, either you talk or we go to the police. Is that what you want? A sentence for heroin? Or this? Uh, no! So you'll tell me who's behind it? Yeah. All right then. Go ahead, tell me now, then. (stammering) No. All right, I'll keep you here until you will. And sooner or later, they're gonna come for us. Now listen, Tiger, go and stop Harry's men from disturbing Tomashi's sister Machico. Harry wants the ninja body as well, so you must kidnap Machico and force her to hand over. Tomashi's body of the Golden Ninja Warrior. Victor. Yes, boss? [Tiger] What's happened about that deal? Bad news, boss, the buyer turned out to be. Harry's man Jaguar, and he kidnapped one of our guys. [Tiger] Ah. Victor, you let me down again. How can I trust you when you louse up like this? How could you let one of Harry's men sneak in and outsmart us? You didn't make the thorough checks expected of you, and you haven't done your job properly. You know that you have to pay for this. But I'll give you a second chance. Kidnap Machico successfully and you won't lose another finger. [Victor] Yes, sir. I propose a toast to Machico and to all of you, cheers. [All] Cheers. Hey, wait! Machico, happy birthday. Thank you very much. Right, everybody, let's all drink again. Cheers! [All] Cheers! (screaming) (suspenseful music) What happened? It's nothing serious, just a power failure. Where's Machico? Where's she gone? Machico, where is she? (disco music) All our orders are full this year, but the market is changing fast, so we must prepare and be ready for it next year. Well look, our designers are creating multipurpose swimsuits. Oh. Very good idea, but we should put stress on both outdoor and indoor use. I think swimsuits are also very suitable for aerobic exercise and sport. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. That style's nice, but it could use more pleats. I think the trousers should be in pink. I'm not so sure. With the white pants it's more elegant. Oh, by the way, I've arranged a meeting with our designers for this evening. Oh, okay. No, not this evening, she's gonna be busy. [Both] Huh? Oh, Harry, I forgot about dinner. You can't forget to eat. Besides, Polly can take care of everything. Have a nice time. Thank you. Oh, will you remember to change the meeting to tomorrow morning, hmm? Bye, Polly. Sure, bye. What kind of food do you want to eat tonight? Whatever you like. Hey, look at the window. (suspenseful music) What does that mean? Just some stupid kids fooling around. (suspenseful music) [Robot] Traitor, listen to me. If you want to live, return the Golden Ninja Warrior to the Empire. You have only got two days left, only two days left. (phone ringing) Yeah? [Dick] Hello, boss, this is Dick. I've got somebody who wants to speak to you about Machico. So you're Victor Li. I want to speak to Machico. (laughs) This is Machico. What do you want? Now Machico, this is Jaguar Wong. I wanna know how they're treating you. I'm okay, but why am I here? I'm real confused. [Jaguar] Machico, now listen, don't tell 'em anything. Okay. Now look, I know what happened. Tomashi must've left you the Golden Ninja Warrior. For God's sake, don't tell them where it is. It'll be fatal, they're gonna kill you once they get their hands on it. And what about the stuff you stole from us? Well, I'm ready to make a deal with you guys. I'll return both the heroin and the man I kidnapped in exchange for Machico. (chuckles) Okay, it's a deal. You meet us at the Volvo Nightclub at eight o'clock. And don't forget the stuff. (upbeat music) (disco music) (audience applauding) (disco music) (suspenseful music) Hi there, Jaguar. Well, Lily, we meet again, just like old times. Anyone would think you were following me. (groaning) (suspenseful music) Hold it right there. (grunting) Okay, bastard, it's my turn now to give you a taste of your own medicine. Ooh, you're really gonna pay. Do you remember how you locked me up in that hotel wardrobe for a few days? I tell you, you're not gonna forget that ever. Hold it! So where's the stuff? Boss, he deliberately left it behind. He had no intention of returning it. He's just a double crossing bastard. Well, Jaguar, you're one of Harry's men. You're very well informed. I guess she told you. What other lies has she told? You sound jealous. Okay, smart ass, let's cut the crap. We had a deal, you were supposed to bring the stuff. Now where the hell is it? Or is the deal off? You get the stuff when I get Machico. And if I don't get Machico, no deal. [Victor] Aw, is that a threat? I wouldn't call it a threat, it's just an order. Bring in Machico. (dramatic music) Jaguar. Machico, I really missed you. Have you told 'em anything at all? Jaguar, I haven't got anything to tell. I'm constantly asked questions I don't understand. [Jaguar] About what? About the Golden Ninja body. And you're sure you don't know anything about it, do you? Right, Machico, we're both gonna be leaving here very soon. (laughing) So you think you're Superman? You're just gonna fly out of here with Machico? Maybe I will. (laughing) (upbeat music) Victor, please don't worry, I never loved Jaguar. He loved me. But Lily darling, I'm haunted by the thought of the two of you together. I want you, Lily, to marry me and be my wife forever. Oh, Victor, I thought you'd never say it. At last I can put my past behind me. Darling Lily, we'll beget again. I'll quit the organization. We'll get married and have children. Victor, I love you. (gentle music) (moaning) (gentle music) (moaning) So Jaguar Wong, you'd better prepare yourself because I've come to tell you your future doesn't look long or bright. Well, go ahead and let me in on your secret. Well, it's like this. Since we figure that you've decided to be uncooperative, well, there's no reason for us to allow you the privilege to continue your life, so you've made the decision. Sounds simple. Death is a simple business, you know that. You assume a lot about me. Tell me, can a dying man have a last wish? A cigarette. (laughs) I guess so, after all, it's unlikely that you'll contract lung cancer before I kill you. A sensitive guy. I appreciate the concern you show for my health. Don't bother. No thanks. I really prefer my own brand. You'll find 'em in my bag. If it's not too much trouble for you. Fussy, aren't you? But just to show you how good-natured I am, I'll do it, see? I'm sorry. My hands are tied. Do you think you could possibly light it for me? And have one yourself. Thanks. I'd hate for you to remember me as a mean son of a bitch, so go ahead. I don't usually smoke this brand. But I'll do it for you. (groaning) (dramatic music) [Man] Hey, are you okay? (groaning) (intense music) [Man] Hey, hey! (grunting) (groaning) (grunting) [Tiger] Yes? Listen, Tiger, send the videocassette to Harry. Let him know we have Tomashi's sister Machico. He'll have no choice but to give up. Yes, sir. Victor, explain yourself. Boss, I'm sorry, it was all an accident. I didn't know that Jaguar Wong could pull such a dirty trick and make fools of all of us. Boss, I'll find Jaguar Wong, I'll bring him back. He can't have gotten far, please forgive me. [Tiger] Victor, you've already received one warning. I'm afraid I can't allow you to carry on without punishment. The rule is that you lose your other finger. Boss, anything but that! [Tiger] Well, you've been a good man, Victor. So I'll give you one last mission to prove your capability. There's a videocassette I want you to take to Harry's place and let him know that we have Tomashi's sister Machico. And for God's sake, Victor, don't screw up. Yes, boss. Thank you, boss, I'll carry out your orders immediately. (robot beeping) Huh? (robot beeping) Harry, come on and have a look at this. Look. What is it? [Harry] Hmm, let's find out. [Man] Hey! (Machico whimpering) [Machico] No! Come on, Machico. Talk! Tell us where the Golden Ninja Warrior is and all this suffering will stop. Come on, talk. All right. That's enough! Get the sticks. (Machico whimpering) Where is it, tell us where it is! (crank squeaking) No! Harry, this cassette is being sent to you by our boss in order to prove that we've got Tomashi's sister Machico in our hands, and we're warning you and your henchman Jaguar Wong that if you don't give up the chase for the body of the Golden Ninja Warrior and return the stuff you stole from us, then Ms. Machico here is gonna snuff it. [Harry] Jaguar, this is Harry. Hi, boss, what's happening? Tomashi's sister was kidnapped. I want you to take revenge by kidnapping Lily. We can make the exchange later. Okay, that's no problem. But how could you be sure? [Harry] I've just seen a videocassette of Machico. Okay, boss. I'll get right onto it, these guys mean business. (upbeat music) (hissing) (upbeat music) [Clerk] Can I help you? I'd like to look at this kit. [Clerk] Okay. (dramatic music) Taxi! (upbeat music) Driver, you're going the wrong way. No, I don't think so. I know where I'm going. So tell me, where are we going? Don't be so impatient, you'll find out soon. You stop, stop now! (tires squealing) No, stop, please! [Lily] Stop it! (tires squealing) You wanted to get out, get out then. Okay. (grunting) (groaning) Hey listen, who are you? (dramatic music) Surprise, we always seem to meet up, don't we? A bad penny. Now. There's no need to be rude, just cooperate. And I suppose being cooperative entails going to bed with you. Perhaps, though I wouldn't say it was integral. No, cooperation simply involves you being a good girl and coming with me. Oh, Jaguar, haven't you given any thought to what Victor will do when he finds out about this? (laughs) Victor will be put in a position of having to exchange his beloved for Machico. (laughs) Huh, you're with Jaguar, kidnapped? Let me speak to him. Hold on, I'll hand you over. Victor wants to speak to you. [Jaguar] You know what the message is, you give it to him. Oh, no, Jaguar, I don't do your dirty work anymore. That's all long since passed and forgotten. This is Jaguar here. I've now got Lily with me. I'll release her on one condition. What, what, you bastard? You release Machico. And then you'll get precious Lily back. Please. Good to see you, Professor So. Well, it's good to be here. We've been waiting impatiently for your visit here. Well, I can certainly show you, you won't be disappointed. I've just invented something superb. Well that's good, good. [Professor So] Mr. Chen, you mentioned a change in plan, didn't you? [Tiger] This is true. The original plan, we had a mind for this type of bomb change, which is why we requested you to redesign it as a time bomb instead. I'm sure that you'll be satisfied with what I have constructed. Good, good. (dramatic music) A fine piece of workmanship. [Professor So] Thank you. This bomb is as easily as powerful as the others and with remote control. [Tiger] But will it blow my enemies up? [Professor So] Well, I'd say sky high (laughs). It's just what I need. Thank you, Professor So. You're going for a trip, Ms. Machico, a trip where we have to put you in disguise. Sunglasses. Nice scarf, it looks very becoming on you. (upbeat music) Here they come. With Machico as planned. Victor! [Victor] We've got Machico, release Lily. Okay, Victor. I'll send Lily over, you send Machico. [Victor] Okay, it's a deal, you bastard. Bye-bye. (upbeat music) Lily, baby. Lily, are you okay, huh? Mm-hmm. Machico, let me untie you. (grunting) (dramatic music) You know what this is? It's a remote unit that controls a powerful time bomb which is attached to Machico. I just have to press this activate button and your friend Machico is blown sky high. (fast ticking) (whimpering) It's up to you. But if you don't want your friend Machico blown to smithereens, you better give yourself up. (grunting) (fast ticking) (whimpering) (grunting) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) Harry, look! (dramatic music) (robot beeping) [Man] Betrayers, I want to remind you of the unavoidable fate of a ninja traitor. You must commit harakiri for your transgression. Born a ninja, die a ninja. (dramatic music) [Man] Our Ninja Empire is supreme, omnipotent, and righteous. Our blood is motivated by ninja spirit. When we take up a mission, we must succeed or die. Our techniques are dominant and unbeatable. Our style is unique and hypnotically elegant. If you don't want to suffer to the wrath of the wicked, then give back our Golden Ninja Warrior. And I am a ninja terminator. (boat motor roaring) Hey! It's Jaguar Wong, he's here, Jaguar Wong is here. (dramatic music) Tiger Chan, I'm from Interpol, you're under arrest. Jaguar, you'll be lucky. Leave. (dramatic music) (waves crashing) (grunting) (groaning) (grunting) (dramatic music) (grunting) (dramatic music) (waves crashing) (psychedelic music) (suspenseful music) (swords clanging) (grunting) (dramatic music) (grunting) (dramatic music) (grunting) (swords clanging) (hissing) (rock music) (grunting) (dramatic music) All right, kill me. Your death will serve no purpose. I've lost face, I could never return to the Ninja Empire.
