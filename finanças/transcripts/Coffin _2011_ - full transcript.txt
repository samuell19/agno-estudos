Tick, tock, tick, tock tick, tock, tick, tock... No... Oh, God Sean? Sean? I'm here, I'm here Where are we? I don't know It feels like a box of some kind. Oh, my God! Help! What do you remember? That guy at the house last night He just came out of the shadows at me. I tried to get away Sean I did, but couldn't... He said he was gonna kill us Oh, my God! Help! What's happening? Help us! Wait, I feel something What? What is it? It feels like a lighter Hold on, hold on. Okay, I got it Oh, my God, no! Help us! Help us! Anyone! This thing isn't moving Rona, listen to me Help us! Come on, come on I don't think anyone can hear us, okay? I can't breathe Here, Sweetie, look at me I can't breathe. We've got to save our energy, okay? Just stay calm, stay calm What is that? What? Oh, my God... Is that a video camera? That sick bastard is videotaping us. There's a box here, there's a box. There Okay. I got it. Okay. Oh, thank God All right, wait Oh, my God We've got flashlights Oh, my God, oh, my God! Help There's a phone There's a phone! Ohh Shoot I think it's blocked What? We can't call out Oh, no Oh, my God, oh, my God "By the time you're reading this the clock will already be ticking. The estimation is that you probably only have 75 more minutes before your oxygen runs out It says, "As you've already discovered there's no escape from your coffin. Your only hope of survival depends on the actions of one man. Only he can save you His name His name is Jack Samms Oh, my. Sean? Sean? I'm here. I'm here Where are Iâ€™ve? I don't know It feels... Like a box of some kind Oh, my God! Help! What do you remember? That guy at the house last night Hello, Jack How the hell did you get in here? That's not really important What is this? Who are you? The question, Jack is what are you prepared to do? Yes, go for the knives, Jack Where is my wife? But if you're the smart man I think you are, you'll listen to what I have to say. How do you know my name? Word gets around Is this about money? If this is about money, I can pay. Okay? Let's just talk this through and we'll be fine. Your wife, Rona She's a beautiful woman Do you love her? What? What are you Answer the question, Jack What are you.. Do you love her? Of course I love my wife Because I hear sometimes one can fall out of love. You two have been married for what... Five years? Just tell me where she is I won't tell the cops I swear. Humor me, Jack How long have you been married? Six years, next month Now please! Does she still do it in the bedroom for you? Just tell me what this is about You break into my home you start asking me questions that make no sense. Please! I have money, I can pay! Please just tell me where my wife is! You will learn to answer all my questions, or today will be very, very bad for you So answer the question Like with any marriage it might be getting a little routine. When was the last time you had sex? Come on! I will not warn you again! I don't even know It's been weeks, maybe months I don't know, okay? I guess that's why you slept with that cocktail waitress. A man does have his needs Pay attention, class That is a live feed from a video camera that I've placed in your wife's coffin I provided them with flashlights so they could see their surroundings Who are you? You can call me... Trick Obviously it's not my real name... I just kind of like it Where is she? How can I get her back? I think you've already lost her, Jack. It's a test What kind of a test? A test to see if your wife and her lover can last in that box more than 75 minutes before their oxygen runs out Tell me where she is! Have you ever seen anyone die of suffocation, Jack? Hmm? That look of sheer primal terror as the respiration arrests. You know, and then and then that sudden last twitch and then something so sublime so calm, so still... And then nothing as if you can see the life just lift off the body like, like a ghost. It's quite beautiful, really. You tell me where she is you sick son of a bitch! Do it if you want, Jack but you will still be the only suspect. You see, I'm a man who puts people in situations, and it's how they react to that situation that's key! And this is your situation Your wife has been having an affair, and you know it! Now she and her lover are trapped in that wooden tomb underground and they're losing air by the second! So, yeah, you can try to clip me out of this picture and try to find her on your own. Or you can go to the cops and try to find her, hopefully in 75 minutes! But the fact remains, man, there's only one person who really knows where she is, and you're looking at him! So going to the cops will definitely make you Suspect Number One! So what do I do? What do you do? Come here! You have less than 75 minutes to do exactly what I tell you to do and save your wife Or you can try to beat the murder rap and let them die and do this all on your own! The choice is yours You want money, don't you? Well, money is a driving factor, yes But you know what? I just find it kind of fun watching people like you squirm Why me? Why her? Why not? Let's go for a drive shall we? Ahh! We're gonna die in here Hey, don't say that Don't! We have time to figure this out You know, he wouldn't be videotaping us if he wasn't coming back for us Because he wants to watch us suffocate, Sean I'll find a way out, okay? I'll find a way out Mind putting these on for me, Sport? I thought you said you were gonna cut him off back there Well, Epperson, tonight I thought you could use a little exercise Out of breath? Well, you look like an insurance agent Let's get that down Out here, this means something You've got to let them see it Let's go, kid All right, let's just take him down for the lineup... No, no, no I'm sorry. That is a huge waste of time What are you doing? Don't do this. Watch and learn Scott! Let's go, jackass Are you kidding me? Epperson You are You are not taking this kid Into that woman's apartment Scott. Scott! Miss Franks? Detectives Scott and Epperson here We need a suspect ID from you, please. Come on back Stay right here Miss Franks? Yeah, come on in Miss Fran Sorry. Sorry for what? Did you catch the perv or what? Yeah, we think so Then you shouldn't be sorry. Miss Franks, perhaps it would be best if you... Call me Frankie Miss Franks makes me sound like my mother or something. Okay. Frankie, what I was saying is perhaps it would be best if you get some clothes on and let's get this show on the road. Want a cigarette? I don't smoke You can look at me, Detective I'm sure a man like you has seen way more than this before. Yeah, I have Now get your clothes on and let's go make an ID What are you lookin' at, shithead? You like climbin' trees and lookin' in people's windows, huh? Well, it finally got you caught I might have slipped on my way down to the floor Shut up, idiot Is that the peeper? Yeah, that's him. Get him out of here Get him in the car. So, uh Miss Franks, I was thinking If you wouldn't walk around here with the blinds open Wearing... What it is you're wearing, we wouldn't have to come out here and do this sort of thing. I'm gonna take that into consideration. Thank you Please do Okay. Good evening See you soon We could have driven my car I won't be going back to your house, Jack. I'd rather you be the one to hail the cab ride home If you're a good boy, I might even pay the fare Where are we going? You know where we're going The bank is closed I'm sure you'll think of something. I just had some investments go south recently. I can get my hands on some money. How much do you want? How much is she worth? Wait, let me rephrase How much do you think your life of freedom is worth? You can't ask me that You're not very good at answering questions are you, Jack? You can't put a price on lives, that's all I'm saying I can only get my hands on so much in the next hour You better hurry up! Time is ticking! You ever consider a nicotine patch? Yeah, I've considered it I'm wearin' one It doesn't work Gum doesn't work Acupuncture is crap Quittin' cold turkey is pretty much out of the question so I started my own system Put it in my mouth don't light it. It's workin Yeah, it's workin' like gang-busters So, you guys get a lot of peeping toms around here? Na Well, no more than any other place, I guess That's the most action you're ever gonna see out here I do miss the East Side How long you been out here? Four boring-ass years You shoot one scumbag drug dealer, unarmed... Media makes a huge deal about it the department wants to make a lesson out of you so they transfer you You know what I should do? I should shoot somebody out here and see if they transfer me back Yeah? Scott here Yeah Hold on a second All right, go ahead Mmm-hmm The address? Okay. Yeah, we'll do a drive-by. Okay. Well, what was that about? Some guy didn't show up for work, like, two days and now his landlady is sayin' somebody messed with the locks on his door. All right, well, let's get going We will... As soon as I finish my dinner Hey, every minute counts Epperson, is it always gonna be like this with you? Because I have worked the beat. You haven't And for the record, my last partner was a woman and she didn't nag one bit Hey, good call on this turkey whole-wheat thing It sucks Let's just, uh cover every seam where the boards meet If we can get a little separation maybe we can get some leverage to pry it open. If we go through the floor we're just gonna hit all that dirt. I think, I think it's sand so maybe we can just dig our way through, you know? We'll start with the floor first and work our way to the walls Yeah, but I don't It's something, Rona! At least we have to try something! I mean, if you have a better idea, just tell me now Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Here, give me your light Put it right here, okay? Right there All right, we should save the batteries. Yeah. All right. Okay. Can you do one more thing for me? I'll try. All right We need to breathe shallow and just force yourself to relax Okay. We should be able to buy ourselves some extra time in here maybe enough time until he comes back for us Okay? Okay. We can do this Yeah. Start with the floor Okay. All right How are you doing, Sweetheart? Are you the apartment manager who called earlier? Yes, Sir They said they'd be sending someone right over I've been waiting Yes, I apologize Something came up, police business, you understand I need to get to my other rental property. Okay, this will only take a couple of minutes, just a few questions real quick. Epperson, would you mind... Takin' a couple notes for us? Thank you Uh, first question, Sweetheart your name? Penelope Grant Uh, Penelope Do you mind if I call you Penelope? Thank you Uh, Penelope, when you saw that the lock had been broken and the door was partially open did you enter the premises? No, I called Mr. Sean and he didn't answer. He hasn't been around here for a couple of days, so, I called the police on my cellphone. How long have you been renting to, uh, Mr. Sean Justice? Six, maybe seven months Okay. Has anything like this ever happened before... The broken lock any unusual people around the property? No. Never Well, that's good enough for me Uh, Epperson here will get your information and we'll call you if we need anything Excuse me one second Do you think we should maybe schedule a formal statement? Epperson! You kill me! That's funny, that's really funny. Penelope, a pleasure How's this looking? I just called Crime Scene They are en route but they got a little hung up, so Yeah Is there a "Law & Order" marathon on cable tonight? Here. You know what? I am a good detective for the record. Epperson, all I know is you've been pushin' pencils your entire career. Now they suddenly have you riding shotgun in my car. I don't give a shit if you're a good detective just don't try and change the way I do things. It looks like you got this under control Iâ€™ll go check out the bedroom Now you're talking like a good detective Up yours, Burnout There's nothing, Sean Okay, come on We're gonna work the walls, okay? Work the walls We shouldn't have done what we did. What do you mean? I cheated on my husband with you, now we're being punished We're not being punished Yes, we are Why else would that psycho have mentioned Jack's name? He knows about us No, there's no way. Yes, he does. How else would Jack be involved? Come on, you're overreacting I'm not overreacting! He's gonna kill us for what we did. God, it was so stupid! Don't say that It was us... It wasn't stupid If anything, this is Jack's doing Jack is not even capable for something like this. He is a good person A good person? Come on What? You can't... Take back the things you told me about him just because we're in this now You two aren't even in a marriage and you know it Don't start blaming yourself for this now. I'm not blaming myself So, so you're blaming me? Are you blaming me? I didn't say that Shit! Just, just, just stop We have to breathe shallow I'm sorry. I'm just scared Now this is what I want Why haven't they call me? Think, Jack Would I put a phone in there where they could make outgoing calls? By now you should know me much better than that. That phone can only receive phone calls. I want to talk to her And what are you gonna tell her? That you're on your way? That you're her knight in shining armor? Come on, man, you already failed her in marriage. What makes you think your voice is gonna be any comfort to her? I want to say I'm sorry. You're already planning on failing. God, it must be miserable to be such a loser in life. Just let me talk to her! No! The plan stands You do as I say, or she dies, plain and simple Tick, tock, tick, tock I would have called, but you destroyed my phone Then I guess you better find a pay phone. What'd you get? Well, nothing to write home about Uh, no keys, but the car was gone so either he drove himself or whoever broke in took the car. I did find some receipts on his dresser from the last couple of days Thursday, 46 on gas Yeah Um, looks like he dropped It's not itemized, so we don't know what he got. Right, right Uh, let's see what else we got here Dinner at Mambo's Now this is interesting He spent $180 at Mambo's so unless he ordered, like three bottles of wine He had someone with him Or someones You know, it's probably nothing but if you could find out, by running his credit card what he got, I don't know, it might lead to something. I'm on it Now this is interesting Looks like he was quite enamored. Hmm... Pretty girl Yeah. Nice It came with those Hello! Mmm-hmm He can take pictures That's my, uh, that's my favorite Here we go. Nice composition there Wait a second Why does she look familiar? See, I was thinking the same thing. I can't place it, though She's on, uh, on TV or something? Hey, hey. That, uh, no, that commercial Uh, Dave's Corn Chips The one with the dog and she's chasing him Ran during football season â™ª You'll be sworn Dave's Corn.. â™ª Right, right, right Country Barbeque... Best ever Um, same girl different hair. Right. Itâ€™s definitely her Hmm You know what? Try to get her name Talk to her and see what she knows. Done Okay. Well, he was definitely grabbed on the couch, I would say. Knocked over the table crushed the lamp... Wine glass, yeah but then... Doesn't make sense, does it? Unless... There were two attacks Either that, or maybe Sean Justice wasn't taken from here at all Maybe whoever did it took him from somewhere else and came back here just to make it look like they took him from here Yeah, but why would they do that? We've got to figure that out Maybe you're not such a burnout after all. Cheers, Bud On second thought What's going on? I can't talk here. Let's just get inside Come on I'll tell you all about this later on I can't talk right now, all right? You're gonna have to give me something I know. I could lose my job I get it. I understand I don't want you to lose your job. Hey, I think I've got something here. What is it? There's a knot in the wood here but it's loose Oh, my God If I just keep chippin' away. What about the sand? One problem at a time, okay? Okay. All right Hold on... Where's my flashlight? There it is. Okay. Here we go Oh, God, I need to make it bigger If I could just get it in there I could break the wood. Burn it! What? Burn it. Just use the lighter and burn around the edges If this thing catches fire we'll burn alive Just enough to get the flashlight through Come on, Sean! Rona.. We are running out of time Your headband What? Give me your headband Okay. Come on. Oh, my God There, see? It's loose, it's loose Look at that. Oh, my God! Okay. Garrison, I can't talk about it, okay? Iâ€™m almost out of time Whatever you can do I appreciate it. See what you can do Jack, you're gonna have to give me something. We're friends, but I can lose my job over this I understand I just need your help, okay? I'm in a jam... I promise to clear all this up. Just tell me what you can do for me, okay? Okay. He's gonna let me know how much I can get. Ten minutes Stay here I have to make a phone call Is that your man? How much can I get?

I'm not gonna do this unless you tell me what the hell is going on I have a wife and a family. I can't get mixed up in something. I can't But I need that money right now How long have we known each other?

You said I could get 550,000 I want the other 50 But I can't get it until tomorrow. You never gave me a price. You said whatever I could get I know, but 550,000 sounds so much better than 500,000. And now you have my heart set on 550,000. Trick Yes? Please! It looks like you're gonna have to find another 50,000 Thirty minutes? Yeah Let's get a drink You really should have let us in the house first, Scott. Is that what they teach you in science class, Pops?

Yeah, he'll be back in a few minutes. Mr. Garrison, how much money exactly can he cash out? Well, he has a few hundred thousand in the CDs. I mean, some of his investments went south but, you know, I'm really not at liberty to say. Mr. Garrison, I can come back in here with a warrant and do a can opener on your computer. This is a minor detail in a preliminary investigation What harm could it do to tell us how much cash he has access to? He has, uh, 550,000 and some change in his CD Uh-oh... It looks like they're having drinks Drinks? Yeah, the credit card it's just... His credit card, Mr. Garrison? Uh, you know Mr. Garrison, you're really starting to piss me off.

You are sick! Mitch! Call the cops Don't! Do it, Mitch! Everybody. Everybody stay cool No one's callin' the cops Hey, man, relax, all right? You don't want to hurt her Everybody on the floor Now!

You're running out of time They have air, you son of a bitch! Oh, thank God No! Down! Behind the bar? No. wait I saw it on the camera when you were on the phone I'll take my chances with the cops...

No, his car's still here I just got off the phone with the rental car company that Samms mentioned to Garrison Guess whose name is on the, uh, rental? What? You want me to say it? Who? Sean Justice When? Yesterday morning What the hell's goin' on here, Epperson? I can't figure it out Maybe somebody nabbed Justice then stole the car, or they stole the credit card rented the car. That doesn't make any sense The database shows that Sean Justice has a car in his name, so why would he need a rental? You talked to his work? Did Uh, office drone Well liked, never caused problems They said he is, uh an actor, takes acting classes at night Which classes? I don't know. I'll find out Do it. Get out! Jack, do not slow down!

And make our faces towards to our hearts disguising what they are You must leave this Good job Excellent! That is exactly what we've been working towards You have to play the unraveling of the individual characters, yet you have a responsibility to work together to bring their love to life Breathe life into it Wonderful. Excellent Hello. This is Jack Samms Who is this? Mr. Samms, hi. My name is Sean Where is my wife? Is she there? Let me talk to her Hold on Jack! Rona! Where are you? Help us! We're running out of time Jack, there's water everywhere and we can't stop it. Did you get the money he wants? I have the money, but I got away from him Help! Jack, give him the money. He knows where we are! Rona, Sweetheart Think. What's around? What do you remember? There's water everywhere! I'm gonna drown! Jack, listen, okay? He buried us near the ocean He buried us in the sand, and we're in a wooden box Punched a hole in the top of it. I know, I saw it I saw it on the video in the computer. How much time do we have? I don't know. Maybe minutes Just give him the money okay? I'll pay you back. Whatever it takes It's too late... We're running out of time What do you remember? I don't know. He drugged us, I think. We were at my place This box, it's big It's got to be somewhere where people can't find it Just give him the money! I told you, we're out of time I'm on my way to the beach Stay on the phone Just give him the money! Uhhh Where'd he go? Look, pal I have had a bad day I have been punched in my face so you just Listen, you finish that sentence, I'll leave your ass right here with a brand new ass-kicking Which way did he go? Uh, down a side alley, there He has my cellphone All right, all right Settle down. Did you get a good look at him? Well, he was wearing... Sunglasses and a hood The son of a bitch is wearing a disguise How long ago we talking? Five, ten minutes Cell phone trace There we go, Epperson, that's good detective work Last number called in get a trace on it. Let's find this asshole find out what the hell is going on! He's got my cellphone We'll take it from here What about me? What? You want a ride back to the bank? Yeah. I don't think so Bus stop, two blocks up Huh? I kind of agree with him So, you think the phone's dead? Come on, gentle, My Lord Sleek o'er your rugged looks Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight So shall I, love And so I pray. Pick up, pick up, pick up! Come on! Pick up! Please! Let your remembrance apply to Banquo. Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue Unsafe the while that we must that we must leave our honors in these pleasant streams, and make our faces towards to our hearts disguising what they are You must leave this I think both of you are ready. Ready for what? I have an idea for the ultimate performance one that will serve a valuable purpose a purpose for your... Situation What situation? Maybe I shouldn't say situation It's more like your position Yes, you see, I know that you two have been doing... For lack of better words adult things. Yet one of you is married... To a man with money, correct? And I think both of you are fantastic at pretending So just think of this as an exercise with the highest of stakes yet at the finish line we stand to make a bit of money. Who's up for a little fun? Guys, it will be the performance of a lifetime plus you will get what you want. We can disappear together The pre-nup will give you nothing if you leave him. We could use the money to get started. If your husband is the business man you say he is he'll pay. I'm confident he'll pay. You'll be perfectly safe the entire time. I will be in control of the situation. I write the script We rehearse it perfectly. What do you say? Hey Jack By now you realize what has happened I'm not a killer and this is nothing personal I see opportunities and I take them. Your wife, she wanted another life, and I could sense that It took some convincing, I have to admit, but once Sean was on board he was very helpful in getting Rona to go along with it. She's doing well, Jack, so if you have any love for her... Well, then that should make you happy. The money's getting her started in her new life, and I did take a little fee for my services Hey it was all a performance, Jack, and you played your part well. I'm proud of you for that You almost broke my nose but I won't hold it against you I did put you in a situation and you responded. You see, that's what I do, man I put people in situations Good bye, Jack It was nice knowing you for a day. But I called them I talked to her There was water All an act Hold on Jack Your wife, Sean Justice Jack, they were waiting for your call. We're assuming they knew the timing of the whole deal just in case that phone rang But the video? Timed perfectly. This guy is He's a... Real pro We did some digging He's done this sort of thing before Chicago, Atlanta, Milwaukee All different cons with his signature on it He profiles people in Sean and Rona's situation And Rona went along with it Just give him the money! Jack, I know that's tough to hear The marriage was already over The upside is that Mr. Garrison expressed that he will not press charges Jack, here's what we've done We put an APB out on your wife and Sean Justice Here's what we're assuming They're on the road, okay? They've got to be using fake names fake IDs, the whole deal Listen to me We will get them, Jack So, the ringmaster? Who knows? Thanks We'll be in touch Thank you, Mr. Samms So that's that, right? Why not? Or maybe I could pay it back That's true. That's a good point Hello, Rona Have a seat Or should I say Candace Burnett Jack Listen Don't worry. This isn't about the money. This is about putting two people in a certain situation to see how they react Isnâ€™t that right, Sean? Oh, I'm sorry... Mark Jack, this wasn't... Wasn't our idea, okay? It was an experiment That's all it was, you know? It was acting You guys, your marriage was over, you know? Rona needed the money You think this is all making me feel better? Or even feel sorry for you? How did you find us? I made some friends Guys that wanted to find you too. Let me get to the point because the clock is already ticking. In one minute, I'm going to make a phone call The person on the other end of the line... Is going to beg you to save his life. If you save his life, you in turn save yours If you don't make it to him in time, you will be blamed for his murder. I've already planted the evidence Except this time... It's real evidence The guys I'm working with will gladly hold it against you along with your other charges, of course Jack, please Why should we believe you? I guess you just have to take your chances. Tick, tock, tick, tock tick, tock, tick, tock... No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!
