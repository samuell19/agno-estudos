Shit In the car she used to snuggle up in the fur coat What kind of car was it? Mercedes Convertible A white one with read seats Leather seats?

After you took it all And left me lying there Did you look at me once more While I slept? Did you think of me after you took the money? When did you forget about me? Cuba, at the beach? Or in Germany already? Cuba is beautiful What are you, a travel agency? I didn't make it to Cuba One morning I woke up in the port of Vera Cruz I was alone The sea was calm Empty bottles everywhere My room had been cleaned out My money gone My friends gone They abandoned me The visa had expired In the end they deported me Deported to Germany I thought I'd work one or two years in Germany And go back That should do it But it got worse Homeless Lingering No jobs No strength What do you want to do now? Come crying to me? Sleep with me? Make me turn tricks? I want to pay back everything Why? Contrition Poor boy I'm about to start crying I'm leaving for the seaside When? Now. Soon. Why? I've to get to the south I can't manage another winter here And where exactly? Nice There are jobs there Hotel caretaker And the cigarettes are cheap there, too, sure I know I've heard this once today already I don't give a shit whether it's a rumour or not I'll get there somehow I'd rather croak it by the sea Back at home my front yard wants digging up Kids with braces A wife A non-alcoholic beer And a dinner table Linseed bread Margarine Lean ham The firebrigade has arrived Gone to get your things. The train to Nice departs at 8pm. Wait outside of the hotel. Everything is going to be fine. Tom She's in Nice What? So she said When? Yesterday, day before that, what do I know? By train? You know how much train fares cost? As much as flying You know how much this tea costs? It costs the same at the airport I could throw up Only the rich manage to get away And how will she manage to get to Nice? Hitchhike? With her ass? What exquisite coffee What is it you want from me? I don't have your money anymore. I've nothing at all. Only decaf espresso is worse than this Are you gay? Listen, my situation is bad right now There are better washed and younger options I'm not gay I may be a little melancholic and sentimental And calculating What does that mean? I could use a friend Fine, and why me? Why not? You see This morning you did not steal from me That's progress And what is the friend supposed to do? Be friendly, have faith I didn't ask how he is meant to be but what he's expected to do To drive You could be my driver Fine, I'll be your driver, but not your friend If you like What is our destination? We should drive to the doctor one more time Why, something wrong with your heart? It's your bladder that concerns me We've had to stop at every service station so that you could use the toilet There are 6,700 service stations between Berlin and Nice You're searching that girl, aren't you? Had you planned to go to Nice together? Yes With my money? Yes Drive, please What were you going to do in Nice? Work Like what, grape harvest? Hotel caretaker during the winter Taking care of hotels in Nice Interesting pastime So that they don't fly away... Say, Tom, is that you? You'll have to excuse me but You smell like an old bed Even in the open air I understand how much you enjoyed running around like that Like a total wreck Don't want to join the rat race, am I right? You're a proper psychologist Do you know what I consider mean? The first time I had some money at hand I went to a tailor and got myself the very best English fabric, Italian shoes, and so forth But do as I might I always looked like an errand boy who had made it And looking at you You look like an impressario I tried everything But I never shed the errand boy I bought one of the most stylish and beautiful automobiles on this planet Modest Clear lines Rather a car for those who've found their inner centre And what will be my duties? To be your impressario who assists you locating your inner centre? That's good, why not I thought I was meant to be your driver Driver, impressario, friend As you like Is she still this beautiful? Give it to me! I'm asking whether she's still this attractive I said give it back! I don't know What's that supposed to mean? We're driving from one service station to the next Searching for a woman you're no longer sure is attractive She's been through a lot Like you? Yes, like me Since when? A few years That's a long time May I take another look? Do you suppose she still has all her teeth? And her hair? Beautiful hair Maybe jaundiced eyes What's the point of these questions?! I beg your pardon, we're driving all over I want to know what this woman looks like Well look at the photo! If she's as wrecked as you She'll never make it to Nice No truck driver would pick up a homeless tramp Am I a bum to you? Forget about Nice She'll be back in Berlin before long - But she has to get to the sea - Why? Because her lungs are trashed The poor always end up back where they were poorest You're firing me? It's the end of your shift I understand you well enough Germany, a cold place Where money counts Long-term deposits, garden and wife, that was repugnant to you, correct? Sure, that's a lot to swallow What have you done to her? I stole from her And I think I broke her heart Why? It's easy to be friendly if one has money We didn't have any Therefore I couldn't be friendly The money would never have lasted for the two of us So I took it and left her behind I think I stuffed up Why didn't you wake me? Calm down, you were sleeping so peacefully I looked around And? She wasn't there This is beautiful Right? I own it And this Is the key to my fortune It fits into a bank deposit box In Belgium You have a dream And so do I Oh yeah? And what's my dream? Some country of which you believe that it's not corrupted, let's say Cuba I must be talking in my sleep Do you still have any relatives here in Germany? There's nothing left for you here Except for the girl You wanted to go to Cuba together A fresh start, a real life And then you abandoned her I'm tired I'm going back tomorrow To Berlin? Do you know how to forge a signature? Take a look Now simply copy the lines Here, take it Just like that Voila Take it, it's a salary, sort of Now listen to me, Tom If everything turns out fine Our little trip would earn you so much That you could start over Cuba Fine I'll wait in the car Yes? This hotel has a hair dresser "This piece, like all of the composer's works, reflects nothing more than the characteristic spiritual awareness of this artist" "The struggle against fate and the triumph of joy over pain" What's in it for me in all this? How much? Let me think How much? Turn off the freeway There you are And I'm going to kill you I've got your money Almost 20,000 I've been looking for you everywhere This time I'm leaving you behind There are cheques in the bag What am I supposed to do with them? I could exchange them for cash For you Fine The banks open at 9am We'll continue then What did you do to him? It was an accident Did you bury him? Yes Who was he? An errand boy Tried to change your identity, did you? I wanted money His money Is that why you killed him? I didn't kill him Right It was an accident I forgot What did he want from you? To be his friend He was crazy, I guess His heart was trashed This is an opportunity The last They money is enough For the two of us We could leave For Cuba Away from all this Maybe purchase a small hotel Your money You can trust me I trusted you five years ago And woke up alone in some dive A few days ago I trusted you again But you never came back You're a liar That's ancient history You say he had an accident But you're wearing his clothes Have his passport His blood is in this car You're a liar, you always were Maybe But I'm changing You're not keeping any secrets from me? No little schemes? No The deposit box key I forgot all about the key Must be in his clothes October 4 Knokke, Overseas Bank Deposit box 120 The key That belongs to me And what happens next? It seems we're going to stay together for a while You're going to play Jimmy And I play your girlfriend During the day What does that mean? We'll go shopping, we'll play the couple in love I need new clothes We'll go to shops You'll wait while I try on clothes The sales women will place them in very beautiful bags That have French words printed on them And you're going to pay You think I'm poor and he's rich And that I've to spread my legs at night He doesn't get a thing from me Nothing at all And at night? At night you make yourself comfortable in your seat And for how long will we play the happy couple? Until you walk into the bank in Knokke, present Jimmy's passport and retrieve the money from the deposit box That's a long time Are you afraid? Well then run off Write a little note and run off And then? What will happen after the bank? What do I know You'll have money, a new identity Maybe you'll become a good person in a hotel in Cuba And you? How long does a woman's revenge last? Who is the subject of her revenge? I am For what? I stole from her A year And abandoned her Forever. You seem to love that money You don't? What were you talking about with the sales woman? I asked her how long a woman's revenge lasts And what did she reply? Three to four weeks Since we met you haven't laughed once And what was there to laugh about? A little smile once a while You mean a little married bliss smile "Dear, thank you for the beautiful dress" Even though I had to force you at gunpoint The good intention was there all along Let us go to Cuba That sank into the sea long ago You had a map of Cuba in your locker For what purpose? To look for you To drag you across the island on your balls And why did you want to learn English instead of Spanish? You've looked at my stuff rather closely, right? I thought it would take longer To get away from this shit and to Cuba That the Americans would be there already And then English would be ideal I always wanted to comprehend the lyrics They're very good, you know Yes Did you actually love me? Don't touch me Now listen to me I waited for three days in that hellish hotel In that shitty town I found a job at the department store Cement floors, neon lights Choleric customers And on my feet for eight hours, the whole day I went to the doctor I still had health insurance And he prescribed deep vein thrombosis stockings Do you know what that means, deep vein thrombosis ?! At 25 years of age! I had to sit down once a while So they fired me Couldn't meet my rent So I ended up in the street, and my lungs are fucked You can't imagine that And you want a smile? Here, look at it Vitamin deficiencies These are not my teeth I don't want to kiss with this mouth It's not my mouth I want it to be like before My legs My lungs My teeth I will get back my body That's my personal social justice And I'm going to get it Maybe I'll treat you nicely then When one is beautiful and rich one may become more generous Perhaps You don't have to get surgery on my account Oh really? I love you as you are You mean for my inner self? You don't know the least thing about that To look exactly like that What does that cost? Better don't overdo it So tell me, can you see my inner self? Do I look like I used to? Different Meaning not as good as back then Well, different Which is it? Make a proper smile About what? A cockoo is flying across the ocean He meets a shark Says the cockoo "Hi" Says the shark "Cookoo" I learned a few for your amusement But you're the one who's all finished In Vera Cruz I used to sit by the sea all the time, too Cuba was on the other side Vera Cruz, Cuba, all shit I think you still want to get there That's long finished And where do you want to go? It's become all soft Mudbaths every day Oxygen You've been here before Tell me Were you just going to push me down there? Get rid of me, just like Jimmy That gun is just an imitiation I'm afraid Of me? Of myself And my revenge I want more and more I want to see you finished, in the gutter Like in Berlin I was worse back then I want to be rich Beautiful I want to be happy I want to see you all the way down in the gutter And that makes me afraid Power is so sad When does it open? In five minutes Here's the key and the passport This is your passport Where do these come from? Shit Do you see those men? They're waiting for something They're waiting for someone called Jimmy Who'll enter the bank Present his passport Be taken to the deposit box He opens number 120 He takes out a package The man called Jimmy Leaves the bank The men surround him They drag him into their car And drive out of town A lonely road The door flies open And the man called Jimmy Lands in the ditch Without the package And next? The correct Jimmy would have come He would have killed you He slips you the fake passport Why should he con me? Why did you con me? It's over We'll separate Everything alright? Yes Hide! Do you have any money left? 200 Mark, do you need any? I saw the car The dealer told me you work here My second day here Dayshift I'm Tom again That's good Would you like a coffee, Tom? Breakfast? It's on me I've the money In that? Yes In here He had a second key around his neck I was meant to be the bait But you haven't been to Cuba yet? I bought two tickets I don't want to live near a lonely hippie beach You don't have to I want to live in a proper town Havanna We'll go to Havanna When? Now I live over there, I'll get my things This time you'll wait, right? Subtitles for KG by stefflbw (2010)
