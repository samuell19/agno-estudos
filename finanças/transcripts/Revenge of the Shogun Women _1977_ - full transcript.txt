No! Come back. Stop! Stop it! No! Shut up! No, no please. - Let this girl live. - No. No. Hey, don't you look at me like that. You, line up over here. Give me that bracelet! Give us your jewelry. Line up. Get down on your hands. Hey, come on over and get us! Get wood for the fire! All right, attack there. Come on, let's move. Let's get out of here. Attack them. People of village, we will protect you. Hey Chief, we're ready! Woo Chin, look at me. I want to capture the radiance of your smile. Hm. Your face is beautiful. For an artist model, you're perfect. Please keep painting, I can't stay too long. Woo Chin, do you know what it's like to be in love and not have love returned? Don't look so sad. I can't paint a sad face. I'm not feeling well. Please, don't tease me. Oh? Sounds like an excuse to visit the doctor. How dare you say that. But it's true. Your thoughts aren't here. They're with that Dr. Choa. Woo Chin? Woo Chin? Good day, please. Dr. Choa. Dr. Choa, please, sit down. What's your opinion? Woo Chin has been ill since morning. She is suffering from a nervous disorder. A nervous disorder? Can that be cured? There is one method that might work here. Oh? How fortunate. Then why not use it? Well... But you must have a reason. The treatment... is acupuncture of the breast. That is difficult. A young girl can't allow a stranger to touch her breasts. Dr. Choa. There's something that I'd like to ask of you. Please ask me. You are my father's best friend. I'd like to pick a date for you and Woo Chin to become married, if you agree to the idea. I'd be most honored. My, my, cured and married, too. The perfect solution. Keep practicing. Dad, what do you think? Excellent. All the young men of the village should practice. It's good for their health and it's good for the village. - Carry on now. - Aye. I have heard that the Yao Village has been destroyed by bandits. It's true. They killed every man, woman, and child. That's why we must maintain our defenses. We can never be too secure. The nuns at the convent are excellent fighters. The Fei bandits are aware of this, it may prevent them from attacking us. God helps those who help themselves. We shouldn't rely on the nuns to defend us. By the way, how are your experiments coming along? Well, in the hills, I have found sulfur caves. I have constructed several bombs, and powerful, too. Are they powerful enough? Are you telling me that if the bandits attack, we'd beat them? -Yes. -Excellent. What are you doing? Get back to work. I'm going to the carnival. Get back to work. I've heard that Miss Woo and Dr. Choa are getting married. Ah, Mr. Chew. Yes, they are. And when they do, there'll be quite a celebration. Not too lavish, I hope, or we'll attract the attention of the bandits. You're right about that. The Fei gang of bandits are really vicious. All the villages are worried. Oh, Mr. Chew. You're sure it will work? You'll have to try it. Let's wait till after the wedding. Mr. Chew. Mr. Chew, listen to me. There is to be a ceremony. I must ask you to leave. Sister, please don't worry. I'll only continue painting. Mother Ming Chun today will die. We of this nunnery must pay our respects. So the great Ming Chun has decided to pass on. I'd like to pay my respects, if I may. Impossible. The ceremony is restricted to the nuns. Please leave now. Ya Yun, it seems that your ties with the world are not quite broken. It is up to you and the other sisters to break all earthly ties or this convent I have founded will come to nothing. I have taught you well. To pray, to work, to think, to fight. When I depart, Sister Ya Yi will discharge the chief duties of the nunnery. I now entrust to you this convent and ask that you go forward in the spirit of the Buddha. It's time to meet the bride. Thank you, thank you. Thank you, thank you. Master, master! There's trouble, trouble! There's big trouble! The bandits, the bandits are coming! They're right here. They're in the village! Close the gates at once. Bandits! Oh my God! Where are they? Right at the village! We've got to get out, come everyone! Don't panic, don't panic! Now listen, we knew that one day they would come. Now, I want all the men to get their swords and do the best they can. The women and children should leave now. But where do they go? There are cottages in the hill. The old folks go there. The young girls, with Dr. Choa, go over the hill to the convent. Quickly, come on, hurry! Run children, hurry. Get them out! Follow me. Hurry up, hurry up. Come on. -Quickly. -Come on. Open the gate. Quickly, get them out. No, no. It's not fair. Why can't my husband come, too? Dr. Choa, he gets to go. That's right. All the other men had to stay here. Why is he different? Dr. Choa can't fight. He'd be quite useless here. Now go on, there's no time to argue, quick. Please sir, please. Here's my gold, take it. Please sir, spare me. Please, spare me. Don't kill me. No, no please. Please, spare me. Please. This way, hurry. Come on. Keep moving, keep moving. Hurry up! Come on, keep moving. Hurry. Nothing here. Come on, let's go. My Lord, spare me, spare me, spare me! Why should we? You are already in your coffin. My Lord, don't kill me! If you don't want to die, give us your money. Me? I have none, not a cent. I'm just a poor man. No money? Right, then we'll kill you. No, no, no, no, no! My Lord, I don't have it. My wife has got it. Where is she? You spare me, I'll tell you where she's hiding. All right, you filthy rat. Betray me, your own wife. Shut up. My--my life. It's all here. -Thanks. -No! No! No! No! No, no, no. Hurry, hurry. Ming Ling, here, take the child with you. - Come on, hurry, hurry, hurry. - Mother. - You there, this way, this way. - Mother, Mother. No, no, you, come with the other girls. You go that way. Woo Chin, who knows what will happen now. You know you can't come with me. Hurry, hurry to the convent. -No. -Don't argue. -No. -Let me go. -No. -All the girls, go this way. Woo Chin, maybe you'll be safe at the convent. -Dr. Choa. -No, Mother, no. -Dr. Choa, take care of her. -Woo Chin, come on. - No, let me go with you. - You must come with me. - No, Mother, no. - You see. He looks after her, he doesn't care about us. Should we go with the mistress? Yes. -The women? -They aren't here. We've searched everywhere. They must have hidden them. But where? They could be at Mr. Liu's. Go check. - They must have hidden. - Come on. Dad, you must leave. You better go on first. Well all right, we'll meet in the hills. Yes, quick. Well friend, why didn't you tell me this house was defended? I didn't know. You knew there was a daughter. There he is. Chew Chen Chew. So you betrayed us, have you? Yes sir. These men, they want your money. Me, I want your daughter. You pig! Pig or not, I want her. You are...Mr. Liu? And you are the bandit chief. Not a very polite welcome. It's a welcome you swine deserve. You watch your tongue or I'll pull it out of your head. Hm, I'm afraid you won't be pulling anything. What have you got in mind? I'll tell you something. The heavens don't like bandits, so they sent me a gift. I'd like to see it. No. This way, hurry. Listen, Chew. Why didn't you tell me one of the Liu's had knowledge of explosives? But I--I didn't think they did. I'm very confused. Who else is in the Liu family? There is one son and a daughter. Well surely one of them must know the formula. I want them both alive. Where would they be? They'd be in the hills, I guess. Go find them! Is Ming Chun really dead now? Well, that's what I was told. Hm, well I hope you're right. If you've lied, I'll have your head. But-- Come on, quick. Let's go. Hold it, men. The bandits are too close. We must go back and fight them. Quick, move out. Woo Chin! Woo Chin! Woo Chin, I must go back, the bandits are too close. -I can't make it. -Woo Chin, you must go on to the convent. -No. -Help the others. -Please stay. -Hurry, quick. No! Dismount! Sister. Well, my ladies. How may I be of help? We came to see Mother Ming Chun. The great Ming Chun is dead. -Who's in charge now? -I am. Sister, bandits attacked our village, so we came for protection. We're glad you did. I will deal with her. I'm afraid you cannot stay here. But Buddhist nuns are supposed to be kind. Can you just watch us die? Sister Yeun, they are in danger. Please let them stay. We are nuns and not soldiers. We do not kill. But to deny those who seek help is not Buddhistic. You've missed the point. We nuns do not kill. Sister Yeun. They won't kill you. You tell your chief, this man is a doctor. You can use him. No! No! Don't go yet, please wait. -You may stay here. -Thank you, Sister. - Let us go! Let us go! - Hey, hold it, hold it. Where are you from? Mr. Liu's village. Where's the rest of the women? They all went running in hills. And the young ones are at the convent. We'll go along to the cottage first. Come on. Come on. You'll be safe now. The bandits don't dare enter here. Thank you, Sister. Where's your chief now? He--he's at Liu's house. What's his name? Pan Quan Fei. Stop that. Sister, these men came here to harm us. Don't you know this ground is sacred? I meant no harm, I only came here to pray. If you respect the Buddha, then you are welcome here. -Let him go. -He's lying. Kindness is right and harshness is wrong. If you are released, do you promise to start a new life? He never could. Buddha bless us. Thank you, thank you. Let him go. Come on, move! Dress his wounds, quick! You're hurting me, help. Let me go, no! Take your hands off me! Let them go! Where's your chief? Dr. Choa, help me, help me! Throw him out. - Move! - Come on, you. Please, don't. - get out! - Go on, then! Stop pushing there. Take your hands off me, I'll kick you! You leave me alone! Huh? From the way they could fight, they couldn't be just villagers. Who brought these two here? We did, sir. Well, did you understand my orders? Hey, Chief! That old nun that runs the convent, she's dead. Have you come to attack the convent? Oh no, I'm quite aware that the Buddha protects you here. If you do realize that, then you should change your ways and become a Buddhist. Hm. I'd rather rely on my sword than on Buddha's. You're wrong. You're wrong. You are a blind fool. Buddha can change your heart. Hm. I'm not a Buddhist. Never was or will be. Then what do you want with us? A girl. Give me Liu Woo Chin and I'll spare the rest. I will give you nothing. Either hand over the woman, Liu Woo Chin, like I asked, or the others will die. Hm. Kill them. Stop! I'm Liu Woo Chin. Free them. Those bandits are bound to come back again. We want to kill them. oh, Sister, kill the bandits. Sister, please kill the bandits. I agree. Justice demands the bandits ought to be punished. They must be fought. We're Buddhist nuns. We do not kill lightly. They deserve to die. To all men, justice will come. Justice may take a long time to come. Meanwhile, they'll kill more. That is fate, and not up to us. Something's wrong. What is-- Sister, bandits came, they took Liu Woo Chin. Oh, Sister. How could you let her go? It was her decision. That's being dishonest. Mother Ming Chun, if you were here, this couldn't have happened. Oh, Sister. Listen to me, I'm following Mother Ming Chun's instructions. They are her orders. Please, say no more. Tell me, how was the explosive made? I don't know. I know nothing of explosives. I can beat it out of you. All right, kill me, but I can tell you nothing. You think because you're pretty, I won't kill you? No, no! Now look, you promised. If I helped you, I could have the girl. Have you forgotten? You'll just take what I give you. But... Now listen, I got your husband to help you think. Now I want that formula, so what is it? I told you, I don't know. You tell me or I'm going to rape you. - No. No! - Hey! Hold it. She doesn't know. You mean you do. Yes, I do. Is that true? Now tell me, what's the formula? Woo Chin goes first. Quick, come with me. All right, no need to grab my mask. Remember me? -You are? -One of the Soo family. Oh, it's you. You've become a nun, huh? And quite a good fighter. I'll kill you! Oh, so you've missed me. You swine! Jump. Next time, you won't be so careless. Let's get them. Quick, gather some of these rocks. Now I'm warning you, do what I say and right now. Hand that doctor over. We will not. And you're going to pay for this. Close the gate! Mother Ming Chun, I've failed you. But I remain a Buddhist in my heart.
