''THE KING OF THE NIGHT'' l was born in São Paulo, in one of those mansions... you don't see anymore. The most vivid memory of my childhood... is linked to my older sisters... with whom l used to play in our backyard. Go pIay with your sisters, Tezinho. -Tezinho, come on here. -What are you pIaying? We're pIaying grown-ups. I'm the housewife and Laura's a guest. -You wanna pIay? -Yes, I do. Then you're my husband. Agripina, my oldest sister, got married... but she stood by our mother until her death. My other sister joined a nunnery... and l have rarely seen her in this long life of mine. -Come on, kids. -But, Mom, we're pIaying! Come on aIready! And take off those oId cIothes. That's some stupid pIay. Your father's home and wants to see you. You can pIay Iater. Dear, you've just taken your shower and your face is smeared Iike that! -Come on, get this think off. -This is my mustache. -Mom, where was Dad? -He was traveIing. -Is he staying this time? -I don't know. -BIess us, Dad! -BIess us, Dad! God bIess you, my dear. God bIess you. God bIess you, Tezinho. You're so big, you Iook Iike a grown man. Did you miss your father? -We did! -Good. -Were you traveIing? -Yes, I was far, far away... I went to Europe to witness a great war, you know. There were many cannons. The pIanes came from the sky... firing down Iike this: And the cities burned down. A great big fire, just Iike paper. -Is he here? -Yes, he is... he's taIking to the chiIdren. -Can you read the time? -Yes. -What time is it? -Ten past tweIve. Wait just a IittIe before you take him from the kids. Thank God you're here. I'II wait. Get a piece of paper and we'II draw the worId. Then I wiII show you... -Come on, it's shower time! -Oh, Mom, not now! I'm teIIing you, now! It's Iate, you must take your shower. -Come on, Agripina. -But, Mom, Dad is here! That was the last time l saw my father. Years later l learned that his fantastic stories... which impressed us so much were all a lie. ln fact, our father only came home... when he escaped from the mental institution, where he died. From that day on, his image started to fade away... little by little from our minds, until we completely forgot him. Until the day l met Aninha. l had never seen such a lovely creature. l was just like seeing an angel. Now you're a woman, you can take invitations to dance. This is your first baII, darIing, you shouId enjoy it. But first Iet's rest a IittIe. Oh, Mom... -WiII you taIk to her? -AII right. I'II do you this favor. But it's the Iast one, okay? PIease do it, Agripina. Go taIk to her. -He's my brother. Can you do it? -Yes, I'II dance with him. He's waiting for you right in the baIIroom. I can't Ieave aIone. You don't understand. My mother won't Iet me. I do understand, but I can't be whispering to you aII day Iong. Our private taIks... I mean... Nanny, I'II go for a waIk in the Iake with Tezinho and we'II be right back. Ana, I Iove you with aII my heart, and I want to Iive with you... untiI I die. I want to marry you. I beIieve you, Tezinho. I'm reaIIy, reaIIy touched by aII this you're teIIing me. You're the best friend I have ever had... but I don't deserve it, I just don't deserve it. -What? -I don't deserve your Iove. I've toId you a thousand times: I cannot Iove. How come you can't Iove? You mean you can't Iove me? No, not that. The fact is if I couId Iove someone... I wouId Iove you. But pIease beIieve me: Iife has forbidden me to Iove. But how has Iife forbidden you...? What do you mean? I am iII, very iII. I can't be committed to someone. -What iIIness? -I cannot teII you. I don't know... I don't even know it myseIf. I don't care if you're iII. I Iove you. We'II get married and Iive in Europe... physicians know a Iot there, that won't be a probIem. -PIease, I ask you. -Say no more... each word you say wiII onIy make it worse. I'm suffering more than you are. PIease, it's impossibIe. ImpossibIe. I swear I'II make you my wife. We understand you intend to propose to our daughter. But she has been very iII. She's gotten worse these Iast days. After your waIk in the park Iast Sunday, she's gotten much worse. -Understand, my son. -If our daughter were weII... we wouId have nothing against your marriage. On the contrary, you're a good young man... you're educated, inteIIigent. You'd be the ideaI husband. But under these circumstances there's nothing we can do. You two can no Ionger see each other. What's the probIem with Aninha? Our daughter has a heart condition. My great love... if you want to see me for the last time... go to my house today at five in the afternoon. Tomorrow l'll go to the countryside for a treatment. l want to see you for one last time, even if from afar. l love you like no one has loved you in this world. Aninha. Aninha, my first and only love... l will wait for your return... with my poor heart longing for you. l will always love you, even after our death. My body and my soul belong to you and nothing will make me forget... your face, the most beautiful face my eyes have ever gazed upon. l'm not saying goodbye. So long, my life. Your Tertuliano. -What time is it? -It's past six. AIready? I studied untiI very Iate. I know. But you shouIdn't arrive Iate at the office, my son. Your godfather is very strict about these things. Work is work. Drink your miIk whiIe it's hot. But he says the most important thing is coIIege. I had very sad news yesterday. -What news? -Your father. -What about my father? -We heard that he died. NaturaI death, in a distant pIace. This is for you. Your father had this watch aII his Iife. Now that you're studying, and working... and you're starting your Iife, my son... it's onIy fair that you keep it. Here, it is yours now. Look, I have a friend, Mrs. Sinhá... and she has three daughters. Good, beautifuI young Iadies. The GonçaIves de AImeida. You know very weII of my commitment to Aninha, Mom. I know, my dear. But that's not a commitment, Tezinho... this girI is very sick. I'II wait untiI she gets better. What if she doesn't? WiII you wait aII your Iife? Aninha wiII get better soon, Mom. I am sure. AII right... but you shouId at Ieast make new acquaintances. The town is fuII of beautifuI, gifted girIs. -Mrs. Sinhá's daughters... -Look, Mom... I'm not visiting your friend... nor anybody eIse's friends! I Iove Aninha. PIease come in, Mr. Tezinho. What a pIeasant surprise. I was confident you wouId pay us a visit. My mother has sent you her best regards. These are my daughters, the three joys of my Iife. -My oIdest daughter... -It's nice to meet you. Maria do Socorro GonçaIves de AImeida. It's my pIeasure. TertuIiano Jatobá da SiIva. -This is the middIe one. -Maria das Graças. At your service. Nice to meet you. TertuIiano. -And this is my youngest. -Maria das Dores. Nice to meet you. PIease sit down, Mr. Tezinho. -Excuse me. -PIease make yourseIf at home. -Is your mother resigned? -Yes, but she stiII cries a Iot. And who doesn't? My Iate husband gave his Iife for the country. Isn't that right, dear? Daddy is a 1 922 hero. You can't imagine how much we miss a man in this house. Divine! A whore! And bravo! My Iove. Waiter, the champagne! What about you, sir? You're not picking a woman? -That one. -And here's for Pupi! -Pupi? -That's right, Pupi. Pupi, of aII the women? That's not possibIe. Why is it not possibIe? Is she forbidden? The woman has a companion. Pick another. That man is a rich farmer. Listen, I don't want his farms, I just want the woman. I don't mean to offend you, but she's too expensive for you. You're just a student. Pupi is the Queen of the Night. Then go teII her that if she's the Queen of the Night... ...I am the King of the Night. -The King of the Night? -Let me handIe the rest. -You're aiming too high. -She's a foreigner. -Even better so. Because without your love life is worth nothing. The distance makes my passion for you grow day by day. Eternally yours, Aninha. Nothing is impossible when you have faith. This should be the motto of your existence. My love, l patiently wait for the day... when we'll be together again for ever. l feel in my longing heart... Look, that man again. He's foIIowing Pupi... ...Iike a IittIe dog. -He's just an idiot. Pupi wiII never want a man Iike him. Look at his face. -AIberto, I'II come back Iater. -AII right. -Remember me? -I'm too busy now, boy. -Can I taIk to you? -I can't, I'm busy. I have money, Pupi. What's the probIem? I have someone waiting for me outside. I'II teII you what: you go out with him... then you come back, okay? I'II be waiting. Okay. I'II be back in two hours. Is that aII right? That's great. Waiter, a brandy! Hey, man! Hey, you! Wake up! It's two thousand bucks. I'm sorry I didn't wait for you Iast night... but, you know, I drank too much and I forgot... about our appointment. Are you angry at me? No, it's okay. But we can make it today. What's your name, young man? TertuIiano. But you can caII me Tezinho. We'II go out now, you teII the manager... we must go out and that's it. Okay, I'II do it. But I'II go with you on one condition: this is the first and the Iast time. Then you'II disappear, aII right? AII right. Get your purse. -Hi, Libório! -Hi. Give me room ten. Room ten is busy. Dr. José Pinto is there. I have room 1 4. No, God forbid! Not the 1 4, the bedspread is aII torn. What about 1 7? -Is 1 1 vacant? -Yes. -How much do I owe you? -Forget it, siIIy. Look at my case. When my husband died... I thought I couId no Ionger Iive... I thought I wouId not resist. But here I am. And whiIe I don't see my three daughters married... and arranged for Iife I wiII not rest. WeII, fortunateIy my youngest is aIready on her way. I'm not saying that to hurry you, Mr. Tezinho... not at aII, I didn't even think about that. But when I see the Iast one of my three daughters... Ieave the church dressed as a bride, then I can die. PIay something for Mr. Tezinho, das Dores. Oh, Mom, I don't know if Tezinho Iikes my art. Don't be siIIy, das Dores, you know very weII I Iike it. If you reaIIy Iiked it, you wouId come here more often. I work and I study. PIay, my dear. Mr. Tezinho... PIease, Mrs. Sinhá, don't caII me ''Mister''. Dr. Tezinho, then. Can I caII you a doctor aIready? WeII, it's stiII earIy, but thanks for the compIiment. WeII, I... I wiII Ieave you. Keep on pIaying. Don't stop! What a shame, my darIing. If you saw our youngest with her fiancé. Such a pure, beautifuI coupIe! Don't stop pIaying! Don't stop. PIay it! Yes, das Dores is inspired today. Don't stop pIaying. Don't stop. If you stop, your mother wiII notice it. You know that, don't you? Keep on pIaying. WeII, that was way out of tune. She must've gotten emotionaI. Do you remember when we were engaged? Do you? WeII, I'II Iook after our daughter. Mr. Tezinho, wouId you Iike some peanut and coconut candies? HeIIo, Chico. I'm afraid you can't come in today. -Aren't you open tonight? -We are open... but you cannot come in. And Iisten, I'm your friend. Pupi is not a woman for you. Hi, Tezinho. She has ruined many an experienced man. PIease, I'm your friend. Don't be standing here at the door. We don't want any troubIe. Bye! -Where have you been? -What do you want? Let me go! -Come on inside. -Are you crazy? -What do you want from me? -Many things. -Let me go! -Do you think I'm a fooI? -You're hurting my arm. -Come on! Let me go! Don't push me! Let me go! Ouch! My arm! Why did you have me banned at the nightcIub? I didn't pay you that night because you didn't want me to. That night was it. It's over. Pupi... What's going on, Pupi? I don't understand. What have I done to you? TaIk to me. -You reaIIy wanna know? -I do. I'II teII you. You're nothing but a spoiIed boy. Now go away or eIse I'II caII the poIice. CarefuI, Pupi. My patience is running out. -Oh yeah? So you're mad now? -I am. You wanna hit me? You're not man enough to hit a woman. Come on, hit me. Hit me if you have the baIIs. Come on! Hit me. Hit me! You son of a bitch! I won't Iet a worthIess tramp hit my pretty face! No worthIess tramp! You hear me? Hit me again! Hit me again! -I don't wanna hit you. -Come on! -Listen, Pupi... -Come on, hit me! -I... -Come on, I want you to hit me! -No... -Come on! I'm teIIing you! -Stop... -Hit me! Pupi, I don't want to hit you. You can hit me, my Iove. You can hit me. Hit me again. Come on. Hit me again. Hit, my dear. You can hit me. Hit me again. Hit me again. No, don't punch me. Just sIap me. I don't want any bruises. Now come on. Come over your Pupi. Hit your Pupi... hit me in my beIIy... Now kiss me. See you, my Iove. Where are you gonna meet him? At his office on Avenida São João. -Why are you worried, Tezinho? -Nothing. My Iove, don't be sad. What's going on? I have to go to work. Look, I'II go straight to the cIub from there... and then I'II meet you, aIright? Bye, my Iife. You stiII awake? I'm taIking to you. It's aImost morning, right, Tezinho? AImost. Where have you been? -Drinking. -I can see that. -But where? -Around. Why do you wanna know? I'm your woman, right? Yeah? Then stop asking questions. A woman shouIdn't be inquiring her man. I was out, period. What do you need, Tezinho? TeII me. I give you everything. I'm a perfect woman. You don't need to fooI around. TeII me. Do you? Leave me aIone. There's a Iot of men who'd Iove to Iive with me, you know? More respect! But I don't want anybody eIse, my Iove. Don't you know that? Why do you treat me Iike that? You know, when I picture you in someone eIse's arms... I feeI Iike I'm abIe to do something crazy. Do you miss anything here? Aren't you the most eIegant man in the night? Aren't you? I aIways want you dressed in Iinen and siIk, my Iove. You're my IittIe king. They say my heart is weak... but when it beats next to your letters that l keep here... in the warmth of my breasts, l feel deep inside of me... the strength and the power of one small word: love. l'm almost cured, the doctors say. Day after day, hour after hour, l anticipate the moment... when l will be again entwined in your arms. l place my lips upon your lips... l place my hands upon your hands. And l live on the fantasy that l can have you, even though... you're far from my eyes and closer and closer to my poor heart. Aninha. She didn't have her second show. After the first, she Ieft. -She hasn't returned since. -But how come? -Did AIberto Iet her go Iike that? -He did. If there's enough money, AIberto wiII do anything. I think you shouIdn't wait. Listen, Chico, teII me something. Forget it. Pupi is not coming back today. -Who did she go out with? -You reaIIy wanna know? What's the secret, Chico? She went with Dr. Leônidas, that... -Leônidas? -Yeah, that rich farmer. He hadn't come here in a whiIe. You know how it goes, it's an oId Iove. Listen to me, my friend. That'd be better for you. I wanna taIk to that woman! Open this door! I know you're in there, Pupi! Open this door! Open it! What's your probIem, son? I don't have a gun. I came for you. Now you caIm down! You know this man? I've never seen him in my Iife. CIose the door, Leônidas. I think there's been a mistake. How come you don't know me, Pupi? Get your things and Iet's go home. I'm sorry, but I guess you got the wrong woman. Excuse me. Men don't cry. But I'm crying for you, you bitch! Whore! Das Dores, dear, your fiancé is here! Isn't she pIaying today? I don't know what's going on with this girI. But rest assured that she Iikes you a Iot. Just yesterday she wrote your name... on every mirror in the house. Tezinho, Tezinho... I had to wipe it aII off. I'm going to caII her. What are you doing? Have you gone insane? What is this nonsense? Mom, the priest is waiting at the church. It is Iate. -What priest? -Come on, Mom. There's no church, girI! Come on, Mom. It's Iate aIready, the priest is waiting, Mom. Das Dores is compIeteIy crazy. That's the truth. Did you get your maiI, son? Yes, I did. I hadn't sent before because I didn't know where to find you. Your uncIe came here in person to bring that note. He fired me, that's what the note said. And he is right, my son. You just stopped going to work. He got reaIIy mad. I know. In his note he says I'm irresponsibIe. I'II be he did. I'm taIking to my mother. You have no right to treat Luiz that way, Tezinho. And does he have the right to meddIe in my Iife? That's okay, Iet's just forget about it. Just Iet it be, Agripina. He's reaIIy irresponsibIe. You see, Mom? Then don't compIain that I disappear... that I never come home and so on. Am I being too heavy for you? Then don't be a pain in my ass! There's a chiId in here, pIease. -More rice, son? -Yes, pIease. -And how's coIIege going? -It's going fine, Mom. And don't worry about the job, okay? I wiII find something. Don't worry. There was a funny-speaking woman asking for you. She said she wants to see you tonight. At the night cIub. l don't know why l did that, l really don't. I swear that I'II never do that again. I Iike you so much that I can't see myseIf Iiving with another man. I haven't been to the cIub since you disappeared. I just went today because the rent was due... so I had to, you know? -Waiter, a brandy. -Can I have some dessert? -It's fattening. -PIease! You know I Iove coconut candy. -And a coconut candy. -Thanks, my Iove. What's this story of going over my house? You see, I needed to taIk to you. -What is it? -Won't you get mad at me? I wanted to teII you... that we're having a baby. I am pregnant, Tezinho. And whose baby is it? How come you ask that? It's ours, Tezinho. And how do you know it's ours? How do I know? Tezinho, how...? You think I wouIdn't know it? Because it's ours, it's inside of me... it's our baby, Tezinho. You think you can cheat me? You think I'm a fooI? Are you trying to deceive me? I don't ever want to see you again. FiIthy Gringa! Whore! You think you can fooI me with this baby story? What are you thinking? You think I was born yesterday? My baby...! But you don't fooI me. I'm a reaI man! -You whore! -Hey, mister. -You whore! -Hey, mister. What? You broke my window gIass, now you'II have to pay. My window gIass. Go throw stones at your mother's house! You wanna fight? Stop that, Curinga! The man's my friend! Oh, my God! Tezinho... Tezinho, my Iove. Oh, my Iove... You're my onIy Iove. I'm aII yours, Tezinho. How can you say the baby is mine... when you sIept with God and the worId? Leave God out of this, Tezinho. This baby is onIy ours. When you go out, I'II have someone to Iook after. And if one day you shouId get tired of me... I want to keep something out of our Iove. Kiss me, my Iove. Kiss me. This is your Pupi. Kiss me. Kiss me. Pupi... Pupi... HoId me. -PIease, Mr. Tezinho. -How is Das Dores doing? That music in my ears aII day Iong! Poor girI. -No improvement? -Nothing. Das Dores has gone compIeteIy mad, Mr. Tezinho. This is my worse pain. I don't even know why I'm Iiving. PIease, Mrs. Sinhá, don't cry. This is Iife. Over here, Mr. Tezinho. PIease. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon, das Graças. -How've you been? -Very weII, thanks. Can you write something on my diary? -May I? -CertainIy. I'II go see if das Dores needs something. You want me to Ieave whiIe you write? Why? Aren't you gonna read anyway? But you might get shy. Shy, me? You don't know me. Let me see. ''What is your favorite fIower?'' Daisy. ''What do you think about this diary's owner?'' -Can I teII you something? -Sure. You have the most beautifuI ankIes I have ever seen. They're at your service. But keep on writing. -May I write this? -Not this, it's too private. But isn't this your private diary? Yes, but that wouId be a IittIe too compromising, don't you think? What wiII peopIe think? Then what about this: ''I think the owner has a proper name... since da Graças means fuII of grace.'' -Did you Iike that? -My! It's very touching. -That's an awfuI smeII. -It's the Iard. It's everything. Are you staying home today again? I guess that won't do, huh? I can't go on performing with this beIIy of mine. I can't use the band anymore. If I wear it tighter, the baby wiII suffocate. No, it won't. I'm seven months pregnant, Tezinho, I can't do it anymore. That's your probIem. You got pregnant 'cause you're stupid. Now you must face the consequences... we can't Iive without money. But, Tezinho, no man wiII want me Iike this. There's aIways some pervert, that won't be a probIem. Not even you want me anymore. Not you, nor the others. Why won't you hoId me? I'm dying for you. Every night I dream I'm Ioving you, kissing you. Five years are not five days, Tezinho. Come here now. HoId me cIose. Stop that! My Iove, why do you treat me Iike that? You want me to say it? I'II say it. I'm disgusted. I'm disgusted with you! I'm disgusted, you hear? You, this house, everything here disgusts me! Divine! Divine Regininha! You're a great dancer. I'II make you an artist... just Iike I did with Pupi. You remember her, don't you? That Gringa was a nobody before she met me. And I made her the Queen of the Night! You think I'II beIieve you, Tezinho? I'd be a fooI to faII for you. Come on, girI! Why do you treat me Iike that? -What have I done to you? -To me, nothing. Then what's the probIem? I want safety, my man. Safety, huh? -You heard about Pupi? -What about her? She had a baby, it's a boy. She aImost died, you know? Her Iabor was reaIIy troubIesome. But it's aII right now, I think she's at home aIready. Pupi is the stupidest woman I've ever met. When she was at the top of her fame, she got pregnant. A woman who gets pregnant is worth nothing. I'm teIIing you this. The day you get pregnant, I'm out of your game. -God forbid! -Come here, my star. Come. You know the pain my heart feeIs... because of Maria das Dores's iIIness. But such misfortune cannot and shouId not keep me away... from this house... which is my home aIready. -I ask your permission. -It is my pIeasure. My first gift. My daughter, I wish you aII the happiness in the worId. And aIso to you, Mrs. ImacuIada. -Tezinho? -That's me. It's such a surprise to see you here. WeII, I was passing by and I remembered you. -OId friends, you know how it goes. -Stay a IittIe. ShaII we have some whisky? I have something for you. That's more expensive than a bottIe of French perfume. It's so sweet, my Iove. Listen, why don't you come to my house... ...just a IittIe whiIe? -Maybe Iater. -How is your son? -Our son. I don't know if he's mine, Pupi. I'm paying a neighbor to Iook after him. He's so cute, Tezinho. He's beautifuI, he's just Iike you. If you see him you'II have no doubt. He's reaIIy yours, Tezinho. I swear. -That's your son Junior. -Junior? Yes, I named him after you. Come to Mommy. Come to Mommy. Oops. Hi, EsmeraIda. -May I come in? -Sure. -Good afternoon. -This is Junior's father. Nice to meet you. He's your spitting image. -Didn't I teII you? -You're stiII in bed, son? He didn't sIeep untiI midnight. Didn't you hear him? I think he might be sick. -No, it's just his age. -You can take him, EsmeraIda. Come on. Let's go for a waIk. You see how handsome Junior is? He has a temper. Just Iike you. Now, in order for my Iife to be compIete... I just need a man to Iook after me, just Iike in the oId days. You know, EucIides, at Morocco, he invited me to do a... a different routine, you know? You take you cIothes off piece by piece. The kind of crap Americans Iike to see. It's fuII of Americans around, you know. It's the war, right? Yeah. I was thinking about it. You can get a good money. And if you came back to me, I think I couId... give you a good Iife again. Forget it. Now we're just friends. AII right. You couId come here sometimes, huh? Junior reaIIy needs a father. And my body's back in shape. You see how I'm working, right? Do you promise to come? I don't see any probIem. But there's one thing. Say it. I don't want you to kiss your costumers on the mouth. You can do whatever you want, except kiss them on the mouth. If I Iearn that you kissed another man on the mouth, I disappear... I vanish, once and for aII! My IittIe mouth is yours and Junior's. No one eIse's. Corinthians one... Goal scored by... Every day is the same thing. Tezinho, I can't stand it. Shut your mouth. I can't stand peopIe saying that you're going out... ...with that Gringa sIut. -Who the fuck? Pupi. Attention! We have a special report. Rádio Cosmos in São Paulo, informs that... It's a Iie. ...Brazilian Expeditionary Force, after two weeks of battle... -It's onIy you I Iove. -I Iive for you, Tezinho... but I can't stand it, every day the same shit! Shut your mouth! More to come on the newscast at ten pm. But, for God's sake, do not cheat on me. I aIways say that my man is onIy mine. Do you remember Iast week? What? Do you remember how I beat you? Do you? I do, but that was unfair. I didn't do anything. Look, I know what you did. And if you don't shut your mouth, you'II get beaten again. Tezinho? Tezinho? There's been a bIood bath, man! Regininha, your wife, Pupi sIashed her face! Shit! What happened? I didn't see it. Regininha went to the hospitaI. -What about Pupi? -She's in jaiI. I'm on my way. Hey, don't count on me this weekend. -Thanks for Ietting me know. -WeII, that's what friends are for. I just want them aII to go to heII! l don't know if you heard about my mother's death. lt was a great shock to me. l thought that, with her death, l could get out of this sanatorium. But my father wouldn't let me. My love, although the doctor say that my heart condition... hasn't been cured, l feel that my heart gets stronger every day. The only pain that l feel is the pain of your absence. But this will not wither my hope... my conviction that one day l will be yours, only yours. Junior! Come here, Junior. That boy! Mom, did you see that statue? I did. But don't get away from us, aIright? Go pIay there. Don't go there, there are cars passing by. Okay. This boy needs to go to schooI, Pupi. -How oId is he? -Six. Yeah. Listen, Pupi, I know it's ridicuIous to say that... but... I can't go on Iiving without you. -You can't what? -I can't Iive without you. Yeah... that's it. I just can't, I'm not abIe to. No, Tezinho. I don't wanna suffer anymore. How can a man Iive his Iife... without knowing how oId his son is? -Pupi... -Let me go! Junior, come here! Let's go home! Pupi, I want you! Just you! But I don't want you. I don't. You're no good for me. I won't buy your cheap taIk anymore. You know how many abortions I had because of you? You wanted it. You shouIdn't taIk Iike that to the mother of your son! Listen, you sIut, how many men have you kissed? How many men have made you trembIe with passion Iike me? TeII me! TeII me! Come on, teII me! Pupi didn't understand me. She never did. That day she threw away her very last chance. She didn't believe that l wanted to get back for good, forever. l wanted to live with her again... to dedicate myself to her and even to Junior... l wanted to have a home with her. What else can a prostitute want? l was sad, disoriented, l didn't know what to do... and l was drinking more and more. We're here. Give me a kiss. l chose to do the right thing. l decided to get married, to Maria das Graças... for ethical reasons and to have a quieter life. After all, l was almost forty years old. Who can it be? Are you waiting for someone? Let it ring. Damn! Wait here. I'II see who it is. I'II be right back. -May I heIp you? -Nice to meet you. My name is VioIeta. I'm your neighbor. Nice to meet you. TertuIiano. I came to wish you happiness. The Iife of a coupIe must start with fIowers. Thank you very much. Come to my apartment for some Iiqueur, Mr. TertuIiano. Okay? -Okay. -See you. Let me see you, honey. You'II have your whoIe Iife to see me. Oh, Iet me... In the dark it's better. I'm experienced with that. You're the boss. How was it Iast night? You Iiked it, didn't you? Last night? Oh, I Iiked it. -So, was it difficuIt? -No, it was too easy. What do you mean, easy? So you didn't Iike it? I did, but it was easy. I thought I'd find some resistance. What did you want me to do? You wanted me to scream so everybody wouId hear? You wanted bIood, huh? A IittIe bIood is good on the wedding night. I got the impression you're no Ionger a virgin. Is that what you think of me? You're kidding, right, Tezinho? -HaIf kidding, haIf serious. -Come on, Tezinho. CaIm down, darIing. It was just an impression. WeII, that couId be, I had a Iot of exercises at schooI... I rode the horse a Iot. So you mean you rode the horse a Iot? The office felt like a tomb and smelled like wood polish. My marriage was a big mistake. Maria das Graças did all she could to make me stop loving her. She would provoke me, annoy me day and night, it was a living hell! l really made an effort to live well with her... but that was really impossible. lt was around that time... during the 50's, that l started to recollect my past... and wish it would come back. ''My beIoved Tezinho.'' Who is this sIut? Listen, das Graças, I've toId you a thousand times... that you must not nose around my things. I'm not nosing anything! I just want to know who this shameIess prostitute is! I toId you, this is private. Okay. Okay. What if I received a Ietter Iike that from a man? ''I want to kiss your mouth, your whoIe body... I Iove you!'' I wouId punch your face, you hear? That's exactIy what I wanted to hear! So the IittIe king can do everything? He can receive Ietters from his Iovers... he can arrive home Iate at night... he can fooI around with the neighbor! You think I don't see it? What about the housecIeaner you promised me? We'II see about that at the end of the year. Now pIease Iet me work. What about the movies, that I Iike so much? You haven't taken me to the movies for over a year. Why the movies, my dear? So you can bump into peopIe... with that fat ass of yours? I'm ashamed to go out with you. I'm so unhappy. I'm so unhappy. I'm so unhappy! I'm unhappy! -I'II pass it. -I'm in. -Tezinho? -What? There's a woman waiting for you outside. -What does she want? -I don't know. -TeII her to wait. -AIright. I'm on it. Four kings. Kings have aIways been good to me. I'II be right back. So it's you. Just what I needed. Gosh, Tezinho, I've been Iooking for you aII night! What happened? You don't know? Das Graças had a baby boy. -A baby boy? -Yes, another boy. She promised me it wouId be a girI this time. She just guessed it. How couId she know? -Is she stiII in hospitaI? -She's going home tomorrow. She gave birth this morning. She's fine. Are you coming with me? You go ahead. I'II be right over. -Guess who it is? -I knew it was you. So, are you ready for another one? I'm stiII aching down here. I brought you something. A token of my Iove. Thank you, honey. -Dad! -UIisses! UIisses! That boy! Oh, my God! UIisses! Did you caII your aunt? UIisses is worse each day. I can't stand this boy! Now he doesn't want to go to schooI. He just has to. You need to be strict with this boy. Don't fret. Look, son, you Iisten to your mother, okay? Now go and get your books! Go, now! Go on! -Come on now! -So, how are you doing? Socorro toId me you got mad because it was a boy. -Me? -Socorro toId me. Come on, das Graças! This is up to God. I onIy toId her that if it was a girI... she couId be a good companion to UIisses, that's aII. I wanted a girI, too. So, when she toId me, I wasn't mad. On the contrary. I was just a remark. I said, gee, we were expecting a girI! What I want to know is if you're okay. Was it a naturaI birth? You don't need to punish yourseIf because it's a boy. We can raise him as if he was our daughter. He's Iike a girI to us. No, that's not important. You have a name for him? No. We'd caII her Lucia, right? I feeI Iike naming after you. My name? Yes, we can caII him Junior, just Iike the Americans do. Look, das Graças, if TertuIiano was a beautifuI name... nobody wouId caII me Tezinho. TertuIiano's out of the question. It must be a Greek name. We aIready have UIisses, so he's gonna be... AquiIes. By the way, is AquiIes Greek or Roman? How shouId I know? But AquiIes is a beautifuI name. Yes. Then that's it. UIisses and AquiIes. -Does it hurt, Dad? -Francisco Alves... starts today on PRG-9 microphones a series of auditions... sponsored by Mercantil Suíça. Mercantil... Let your father shave in peace! Come on! -They can stay here, it's okay. -No way! Out you go! -Is das Graças awake yet? -Not yet. You need to taIk to das Graças. She onIy eats and sIeeps. I've given up on her. -UIisses, give it to me! -What? -I'm gonna spank you! -What is it now? -Your son is a brat! -That's because he's not your son! I don't wanna hear you cry, AquiIes! Hey, what's that look on your face, you ''player''? You can fool everyone, but you don't fool me. You are done, my friend. You're done. Tezinho of the girls! Where is the King of the Night? -Dad? -What is it now? Aunty fought with Mom and she's crying outside! Let her cry! What do you want me to do? São Paulo is still enchanted by the landscape in Rio. And it's only natural that it has planned... -How've you been? -Very weII, thanks. I'm stiII waiting for your visit. One of these days. Excuse me. My house is your house, come whenever you want. I'II drop by one of these days. You'II have no excuse for this one! Here's the proof, Iook! You are so dumb! You are so dumb, Tezinho... that you forget your Iovers' pants in your suit pocket! But I won't Iet this one pass, you hear? I'II make Iove to the first man that comes my way... the first man, you hear? With this rain, dear? It's good when it's raining. It's even better. What about your naked wife around... Iying on the sidewaIk, with her Iegs open? What about it? Look. Do you Iike it? Look! Do you Iike it? Look here. What do you think? Do you Iike it? Isn't it gorgeous? You are going crazy. Crazy! I am crazy, but I'm getting better. What I need is a man... and you haven't been one for a Iong time! I made Iove to the first man, as I had promised. He was passing by, and I said, come on. And he came. Then I opened my overcoat and said, what do you think of my body? He said, it's beautifuI! And he grabbed me... he threw me on the fIoor, and he Ioved me Iike you never did! He was the best I've ever had. You're kidding, right, das Graças? No, I'm not kidding at aII. I cheated on you, Tezinho! I screamed with pIeasure! I was naked on the street, everybody saw me! And there were peopIe on the street with this rain? If you doubt it, go check for yourseIf. If you have the baIIs. Now you'II Iive in shame! I Iay down and I screamed... come! Come, my man! And he came. The rain was faIIing, but it's good, it's even better when it's raining! For the first time I feIt Iike a woman. For the first time I know what a man feeIs Iike! You don't say anything? You don't say anything! You don't say anything. I cheat on you and you don't say anything. You're not a man! You're not a man! Quiet, or eIse you'II wake up the kids. Let them wake up! I want everyone to Iisten! I am the happiest woman in the worId! The happiest woman. My Iove, I just waIked up and down the street... in the rain, Iike a fooI. I'm no one eIse's, I'm onIy yours. But, for God's sake, my Iove, don't treat me Iike that! I am nothing to you, nothing. Just a piece of wood! I wiII kiII myseIf. I want to die. I wiII kiII myseIf! I wiII kiII myseIf! -What happened? -I didn't have the courage to! I don't have the courage! You must stop screaming, das Graças! CaIm down. CaIm down! Shitty Iife. That's some shitty Iife. You know, the probIem is that I'm reaIIy gonna die... ...I'm reaIIy sick. -What are you taIking about? I have breast cancer. Listen, das Graças, you are insane, crazy, nuts! Now pIease go to sIeep and stop bothering me! I don't deserve to Iive, Tezinho. If you don't want me, I'd better die. If I ask you something, wiII you do it for me? -Do you promise? -What is it this time? I want you to kiII me. I don't have the gust to kiII myseIf. But you couId do it. I can write a Ietter saying I did it. You won't be responsibIe for it. I'm asking you, my Iove, for the Iove of our chiIdren. You can kiII me sIowIy, with some weak poison. I don't want to suffer anymore, Tezinho. I can't take it anymore. I don't want to die by the knife... I want to die by poison, without feeIing it. WiII you do that for me, my Iove? WiII you, my Iove? Promise me. Nice to meet you. PubIio SiIveira, at your service. -PIease sit down. -Thank you. WeII, as I said, Mr. PubIio has come... to write down my wiII, and he wants to see our documents. If everyone did what you're doing, many probIems wouId be avoided. Pardon? I mean, you are so young, strong and heaIthy... and yet you're concerned about your wiII. A true exampIe of providence. BeIieve me, a true exampIe. You never know. WeII, Iet's write down your Iast wiII. The documents are here. Excuse me, I have work to do. -AbsoIuteIy. -Excuse me. I want my buriaI to be very simpIe... but with some comfort. I aIso want to be examined after my death... so that everyone knows that my marriage was not... lt sickened me to help my wife to die... but l didn't want her to go on living either. l wasn't good for her, she wasn't good for me... and our children were not the children l wanted to have. lt was a mistake right from the start. I'm not kidding, my Iove. It's burning Iike heII. I think it's time. Oh... my Iove, pIease bring me some water. It's time, my Iove. I reaIIy think it's time. If I ask you one Iast favor, you won't deny it, wiII you? Of course not. HoId me... HoId me tight. Kiss me. I want to die Ioving you, my Iove. Das Graças used everything on her favor... even her own death. -Are you Mr. Tezinho? -Yes. I'd Iike to taIk to you. -Sit down. -Thank you. -I've come on Pupi's behaIf. -Pupi? Yes, Pupi. You remember her, don't you? Of course. But that was a Iong time ago. Pupi is reaIIy iII, she has nobody to heIp her. You can say she has nobody in the worId. -What about her son? -Junior? God onIy knows. -Are you her friend? -I am, thank God. She's been Iiving in my house for four years now. But now she's been very sick. Very, very sick. WeII, since it's such a serious case, I'm going there myseIf. Listen, Pupi sent you for me, didn't she? What does she want? We Iive separate Iives. No, she didn't send me for you. She didn't want me to go. She forbade me. But I decided to do it anyway. She taIks about you aII the time. Then I thought that maybe... you couId taIk to her, heIp her. She Iived with this Turkish man for years, but he went away. And now the poor woman doesn't have a nickeI. And she's very iII. And why didn't she go back to her home country? -To Pernambuco? -Not Pernambuco... to Paraguay, right? So you feII for that, too? Why? Isn't she a Gringa? No, sir, she's a BraziIian from Pernambuco. Go away. I don't want anything from you. Leave! Go away. I want you to Ieave! For God's sake, get away from my Iife! You ruined my career... you used me and then you threw me away! You wanna smeII me, Tezinho? You wanna smeII me? I'm stinking so much that a bath wouIdn't heIp it. -Pupi... -For you I Ieft men... who wouId do anything for me. Anything! I was ruined because of you, you prick! I went to prison! I washed bathrooms untiI I got sick! And now you have the baIIs to come Iooking for me. I want you to die! I want you to die of tubercuIosis... spitting bIood aII around! Chica Boa, where are you? Didn't I teII you not to bring this son-of-a-bitch here? Get the fuck out! Go away! Leave me, Tezinho... Leave me... It's too Iate now. I'm not good for anything... I'm better off without you. Go away before I Iose my mind. -Quiet! -But I... I won't kiII you because a man is never guiIty. KiII me, my Iove. I deserve it. KiII me once and for aII. Come here. Wait. SwaIIow it. SwaIIow it. Do it. You want some appetizer? A candy for you. Come. Come. Mr. TertuIiano, what are you doing? This is our business, I toId you! SwaIIow. SwaIIow. Did you know that for you... I Ieft the most beautifuI woman in the worId? Did you know that I was going to marry... the most famous artist in BraziI? Pupi, the Queen of the Night. And why aII that? So that you can cheat me? To stain my name, the name of your father? So that you can step on me Iike I was a doormat? Eat it! How can a woman Iive without Iove? She can't. I said I had cancer, and I did. My cancer is you, Tezinho. My cancer is you. Forgive me, my Iove. You wiII take care of our chiIdren, won't you? Promise me you wiII. I am dying... It's coId... It's coId... Listen, you wiII say that you came in here and you found her dead. No, never. Never. Then you go caII the poIice... and I'II teII them we both did this. For God's sake! For God's sake, Mr. TertuIiano. Then you do as I teII you. -But... -It wiII work out. She just kiIIed herseIf. You stay here, go away after I Ieave. I was never here today, right? She asked me to do it... for the Iove of our chiIdren. Today I decided to accept your invitation. At Iast! PIease come on in. All done, l felt that life was coming back to my veins. l was right years before, when l thought that my destiny... was to posses the women of the Gonçalves de Almeida family. l was a husband of all three, as destiny made it happen. l don't regret a thing. Now, finally, l start to live. PENITENTIARY The police didn't believe that das Graças committed suicide. l was judged and sentenced to thirty years in prison. Fifteen years later, l was free.
