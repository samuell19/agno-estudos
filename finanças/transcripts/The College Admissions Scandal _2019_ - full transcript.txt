♪ [police sirens wailing] [police radio chatter] ♪ Wait for it... Here it comes. Oh god, we've jumped to three this year. And you're not opening a bottle of champagne? That's two notches above last year. Well, which puts Danny's chances two notches closer to impossible. Have a little more faith in our son. Who's at one and two? Well, Princeton knocked Harvard off the top. Great. That's going to make about a quarter of my office insufferable today, and another quarter in despair. I love you. [acoustic guitar playing] ♪ [strumming guitar] ♪ The mess you made always seems... ♪ Hey. What did we say about studying your algebra? The test today could tip it to an A. Your grades junior year are everything. Everything is a big word, Caroline. Okay, all right. But if you don't ace Algebra Three, you don't get into AP next year, and you know what an important piece of the puzzle APs are for Stanford. Your entire obsession with me getting in is a massive delusion. Hey, don't be so sure. Double legacy, your verbals on the SATs, your music? We are this close. [sighs] You cannot imagine the way going there follows you through life. The doors it opens. I mean, it's worth the hard work. Now I know my son. It's not the hard work that's the problem, it's the music. And why should he even go to college at all? And we don't have to tell you that music is basically un-monetizeable unless you reach the absolute top. You can climb that mountain with a great job that you're proud of, just as well as you can climb it while you're waiting tables. [car horn honks] Andale, bro. Will you give it your all, please? And will you keep studying in the car? Yeah, yeah. I guess math will come in handy when I've got a table that wants to split the cheque. I love you. I love you too. Later, buddy. -Molly barely broke 1300. -Hi. But they say PSAT plus 75 equals SAT, so that would put her maybe, maybe, maybe in the Emery Zone. The extracurricular would have to be off the charts. She does tutoring every weekend for abused kids at a shelter. Is that stuff even working anymore? I hear nowadays they have to start their own program. Well, and that barely counts unless you get big press. This is gonna kill me. This is absolutely gonna kill me. How did Danny do on the PSATs? You know boys that age and testing. [laughs] But we are sicking an army of tutors on him once we settle on a consultant. How bad was it? High twelves. [sighs] What consultants are you thinking? Still shopping. We adore Joanne Goldman. She got Jimmy Dewitt into Harvard, and that was no mean feat. And I hear Emily Duran is a wiz with the UCs and Lauren Garland did great work with the Orsi twins. Too fast, too fast. It sounds like we are all burning in the same inferno. Caroline DeVere, Bethany Slade. Nice to meet you. Good to meet you. If the rumours are true, I might have found us a saviour, Have you ever heard of a Rick Singer? Pricy. His got clients who send their jets for him. The story is, last year alone, three at USC, two at Stanford. In one year? Yeah. So next week, we are having a meet and greet with him at my office in Santa Monica, San Remo Wealth Management, You know, something little that we do for our clients. If you text me, then I can give you the details. My partner set the whole thing up, swears by him. His daughter's college counsellor had her pegged for Skidmore at best. And now, her mother's picking out dorm room curtains at... Where? Yale. Wow. -Wow! -Nice. So, worst case scenario, we're with fellow sufferers. Best case scenario, San Remo Wealth Management gets some new clients. Yeah. I think I finally got the copy right. How's this? "Hunger isn't far away in the fields of Africa, "or the slums of India, it's just around the corner..." It's... it's beautiful, the graphics are a little homemade, and the guy that does our quarterly reports is a genius, and I'm just going to get him to spruce it up. Corporate and glossy is kind of the opposite of the point. Not gloss. Impact. And the more impactful it is, the more you're gonna shine on your college- Please don't say it. I'm not doing this for college suck. I'm just saying that it's possible to do well by doing good. If we're going to this stupid thing, can we go already? As soon as your sister is dressed. I'm totally dressed. Someday I will teach you how to make an impression. What am I, 50? There's no way I'm wearing that. (Rick) No, I won't guarantee your kids will get into any particular school. All I'll guarantee is I know what particular schools are looking for. And how to get you to check those boxes. This isn't an art, this is a science. And um, I've already done all the risky lab experiments so you won't have to. But you know, after all the chaos, the payoff for me, the thing that I do this for is so they'll find the school that's the right fit for them. Because that's all that matters. Your kids and their success, and the one life any of us get on this beautiful planet with all of its infinite possibilities. Thank you. [applause] Are they torturing you too? The thought of running away to Siberia has crossed my mind. Yeah, if that's far enough. Ooh, there he is. The man of the hour. Hello. And this young man, I... I know you. You do? Yes. I know you very well. IQ busting off the charts, parents going out of their minds because the grades ain't showing it? That's because your mind's on something more important, it's your music. Playing that guitar. [small laugh] Mom, did you tell him? I have never met this man before in my life. I sense the vibe. The soulful eyes. Okay, the telltale callus on the left thumb. No, seriously, it's because I'm looking in a mirror. I was you. Don't let them bully you. Only you know what's right for you. Right? And you, smart move coming with. Never too early to start building your brand. Personally, I think the whole thing's insane. Oh. I'm never applying to college, I'll just join the army. West Point for this one. [laughs] Um, may I give you my card? Oh, yes you may. Here's mine. Oh, thank you. (Rick) Great, thank you. Just give me a call back. Founding Partners, San Remo Wealth Management. Residences in Aspen, Fisher Island, Manhattan, and Bel Air. Husband. Uh, divorced. Ugly custody fight. Drug problems on the dad's side, six billion in managed funds on the wife's. Guess who won. I'll follow up, if she doesn't. Social workers. Honoured by the city for outreach to homeless youths... La, la, la, la, la. Uh, Jackson DeVere, attorney. The firm is Estrin, Orloff and Lobell. Partner? Yep. The wife is a decorator who counts among her clients three Oscar winners, and a sultan or two. Tell me what you want to do in life. I know this sounds dumb, and like what everybody says. But I've been so lucky and I want to do something that'll, you know, will help other people be lucky. Like the food bank thing I showed you, but in a way that, like, really changes things. And why do you think Yale in particular is going to make that come true? Um... Isn't that the definition of self-evident? You wanna change the world, and you have to go to the school with the people that are going to be running it. Maybe we should let Emma explain it in her own words. That's really it. Yeah. What my mom said. Amazing faculty and super smart kids. Okay, but... but Yale isn't the only place with those things. I'm thinking that there's something else, am I right? Well... My boyfriend's a freshman. Okay, now we're talking. See, there's nothing like a personal motive to get you working on your grades and your SAT scores, right? Look, about my GPA and scores, realistically if I want to be near my boyfriend, should I just be going for Trinity? Don't give me heart attacks, and don't sell yourself short. I want to hear what you think, Mr. Singer. Honestly, looking at what I've got... ...Do I stand a chance in hell of getting into Stanford? I mean... Is my mom on crack? No more than everybody's parents are on crack. What the top schools are looking for are special kids. Kids with a personal brand. You know who that kid is? That's you. You just need to prove it to them. So I'm going to be expecting a lot out of you in the next few months. Some college courses to shine up those grades, you can take them online. You're in a band at school, right? Pull together a few bands. Make yourself leader of the program that you created, and you build that brand. Your sand trap is those scores, and the swing that gets you out? SAT prep. Two nights a week. Practice tests till your head explodes. But oh, when those pieces come back together, you're going to be a Stanford man. A little pain now, a lot of gain later, you write your own ticket. The choices are yours, the rest of your life... Are we ready to roll? That's not good enough, I need to hear it. [laughs] Nice and loud. Now, are we ready to roll? Go Stanford! Go Stanford! Go Yale! Go Yale! Yeah! ♪ [sighs] [sighs quietly] Ms. Slade. There's nothing ungood about any of this. There's just knowing where we are. With these scores, Yale is not remotely a possibility. But given Emma's interest in non-profits, the public policy department at George Washington may actually be a better fit. Seriously? Because every year, I pay my $50,000 in tuition like clockwork, and the best you've got for me is George Washington? Ms. Slade, the faculty there is... I know what this is. Some kind of a privilege thing. This is some twisted revenge on the one percent, and if you think that you're going to deprive my daughter of the support that you would give to any other child, we will see how long you have your job. Are.... Are you threatening me? I think that I am. Yeah. It's brain structure. You can either do the test or you can't. Well, it's... it's not just the tests, Danny. It's the last two science quizzes, and the procrastinating. I mean, have you even started your paper on the 100 Years War? No. Because that's not due for another two weeks. Oh, so you're going to wait two weeks minus one day. Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Say it. "Like you always do." I'm scared for you, Danny. I mean, you keep going this way, in this world the way it is? I don't know how you're going to earn a living. And... and don't think we're going to support you the rest of your life. You're going to end up homeless and in the streets! Caroline! Okay, yeah. Now we've left the planet. Where are you going? I... I don't know, maybe to stake out a place in tent city. I don't know how to help him anymore. I swear to god I'm losing my mind. [sighs] I am so sorry, but I need to get to court. That's all right, you can go. I can handle it. [sighs] [phone notification] She's just right here. Thank you. All right, listen. Some of these counsellors, they don't know shit from shinola, okay. You worked with the Kriegers, right? Yeah, yeah. Clay's a... Clay's a good kid. Clay's IQ is the same number as his shoe size. I'm telling you, Rick, whatever magic you worked to get Clay Krieger into Georgetown, you're going to wave that same wand for Emma at Yale. Are we clear? We're clear. So what is it? What is the magic? Hi, Mr. Singer. Carry on, soldier! [In Spanish] To be honest, there's um... There's no magic at all. Oh, Rick. Thanks for coming. Hi, hi, hi. Look, we'll just take the SATs again. I know we can squeeze a couple hundred more points out of him. Honestly, I... I don't think he can do that. [sighs] I mean, you do such great work for so many people. There must be something you can do for Danny. Um... Well... Well, what? There are things. One thing in particular, actually. Well, we'll do anything. The admissions committees give a lot of weight to the athletic group. Being recruited for a sport. It's a very common tactic, kind of a side-door, if you will. Okay, well, I mean for a kid who doesn't even know how to hold a baseball bat, I'm really not up for jokes right now. Nobody's joking here. [sighs] This is insane. Mmm. It was completely surreal. So, how does it work? The... the coaches just get to... Yes. They get to pick a few kids that they want in, and that list gives those applications the extra gas they need to get over the line. So what, Singer just hands the coaches a bag of cash and then they pick your kid, whether or not your kid actually ever played that sport? Well, there's Rick Singer's foundation, and that foundation is supposed to provide scholarships for underprivileged children. But it doesn't. Apparently not. Oh, my God. And the parents put money into that foundation, and then the foundation... Pays the bribes. Are they bribes? Yeah. They're kind of bribes. No, they're actually bribes. Well, there's more. But it costs extra. There's this "shrink", Rick Singer's shrink. Paid for out of the scholarship fund for the "underprivileged"? Mm-hmm. And the shrink says that your kid needs extra time for the SATs, and the kid goes to this special location where there's a proctor, who's also on the payroll. No. Yes. Yeah, and the proctor either provides the answer for the kid, or takes the test after the kid goes, and the scores go up like 400 points, or whatever you want. Oh, my god. So, so that's how he does it. Yeah. So all of this Ivy League, all of this Stanford, Georgetown, USC, UCLA... He says he's done it for hundreds of families. And names you would recognize. Actors, actresses. It seems so easy. I'm amazed everybody doesn't do it. Well, not everybody has a quarter of a million dollars laying in their kitchen drawer. That's how much? Well, it's 150 for the sports and 100 for the test. Cheaper than endowing a library. And no more fighting with Danny. Yeah, well, there's that. So? Well. Do we? Are you seriously asking me that? Yeah. Yeah, why not, do we? I mean... We could get into very serious trouble for this, Caroline. All right? And it would kill Danny. I mean, you know him, he's so... I know, but... Caroline. [sighs] I know, I know. [sighs] Morrie Tobin. Quite a resume. Yale alum, zillionaire, criminal mastermind. Cuffing a guy like this in front of his family. That sends a message. Am I bad that it made me smile to see all those 0.01 percenters running around like ants when you poke a stick in their hill? Yeah, pretty bad. Nobody offered you coffee? I'd like it if you got to the point. I actually don't think you will, but whatever you say. Congrats on stealing eight figures of the hard-earned money of others in this calendar year alone. But just for reference, the last fellow we pulled in on a pump-and-dump on the scale of yours is about... three years into his 18 in Lompoc. Frankly, I'm scratching my head, wondering what you could possibly be building this lunacy on. Scratch no more. [sighs] What if I had something for you? Something like what, Morrie? Does it involve a lot of, you know, money? Oh yeah. And sports. And powerful families, and most of all, elite bastions of higher education. Okay. We're making quick progress here. I've got my shrink lined up to meet with Emma anytime Wednesday that works for you guys. 'Kay, you are a genius, and you're a beautiful person. I will get that set up ASAP. Should I make the 500k payable to your business? No, no, this goes a different route. My foundation. You got a 501(c)3 on that? Yep. Okay. So I get to deduct the whole thing. That's a fringe benefit. And soccer works for the sport. Easy to work up a photo of Emma kicking a ball. Okay. I'm on it. Now, when Emma meets with the shrink, she's going to have to make herself look a little um, you know, stupid. She's going to have to sell a learning difference. Will she play? She's her mother's daughter. Well, kids, you know. I could say you never know. It's um, it's doable to keep the kid in the dark, but it's riskier. Well, I'd prefer to save the risk for my clients. Very wise. [laughs] You coming in? I need to find three examples of irony in the first chapter of Pride and Prejudice , and the quiz is timed. Opening line, for one. Her famous fact, universally acknowledged is neither acknowledged nor universal nor a fact. God, you're sexy when you know what you're talking about. [laughs] As rare as that is. [laughs] Sweetheart? When you're finished with your quiz, could I talk to you for a second? For the Farbers, in an ironic dentist waiting room 1959 kind of way. Yeah. Let's give it a shot. Uh, listen Colby. Would you run down to the design centre and make sure that Dina isn't drowning in that Aspen thing? I'm on my way. So for the Anderson boy, I'm thinking crew. Never picked up an oar, but perfect body for a coxswain. That's worked for us before, right? Gorgeously. So we'll do that for the usual 100k to you... And 50 to USC Athletics. [phone rings] Okay, thank you. Excuse me. Hey, Caroline. Hey. So I talked to Jackson, and we are feeling that you are doing such great work for us, and we want to stay the course, but with no, um... Extra services. Yeah, if... if it's all right to continue on that basis. Are you kidding? Of course. He'll do great. Just keep cracking that whip. Okay, so we'll talk soon. Yep. [sighs] Wait, seriously? I say I'm in soccer and I see a therapist, and that's it, I'm just like, accepted to Yale? Yeah, basically. Wow. Okay, I know, I know, it's a lot. But it's... it's normal. Rick's done it hundreds of other times. What happens to everything else? Do I keep taking the online courses? Yeah, you know, with just a little help from Rick's people. They take the courses for me. Well, yeah, 'cause that way you can just... you can focus on your schoolwork, right? Emma. Darling. Do you remember when we went on the college tour and we saw all those concert halls and the stadiums that were named after the families that gave them money to build them? Of course. Yeah, yeah. Do you think the descendants of those people had trouble getting into those schools? Of course not. And we understand that, and we think it's fair, because we know those people gave that money to help preserve the future of the children they love, right? I mean, I can't endow a concert hall, but I can do whatever I can for the child I love. And, I mean, it's not just the wealthy who find the ways to do the best for their children. Like, what parent of a brilliant minority child wouldn't take every advantage they can? I've read about minority kids who've been accepted to Ivy League schools with SATs 200 points lower than yours, and we understand that, and we think that's fair, because we know those communities are doing whatever they can for the children they love. They have their advantages, and we have ours. It's just one continuum. You studied Darwin last year, didn't you? Yes. It is the natural way of the world. Some species survive, and some don't. Some people can do this for their kids, and some people can't. And, I mean, don't kid yourself, think about how far Yale is from Trinity. It's not just another city in Connecticut, it's on another planet, in another galaxy, and without Rick Singer's help for the next two years, Bryan is going to be on another planet without you. So, we need to start planning. I need to get a photograph of you kicking a soccer ball, for your athletic profile. Can I start setting this up? I don't know. I have to get dressed, can we talk about this later? Yeah. Sure. Hi. Is your Dad coming out west for his week with you? Not for a while. He got a job in Philadelphia. He doesn't think now is the time to ask for time off. [sighs] Oh! A job means he's sober. Yeah, almost seven months. Fingers crossed, sweetheart. Come here. What? Your dad has this huge heart, just like you. But he was born with, what... what's the word for it, not contempt, but a disdain, for the natural way of the world and it just brought him down every single time. And I pray that you can listen to your huge heart without shutting out your mind like he did. [whispers] I love you. I love you too. Come here. Um, I'm glad we could get together and finish this up in person. Coach Meredith. You and me both. So it's a guarantee? For the 450k, my daughter will be recruited for women's soccer at Yale? Yet to fail. Two thousand gets us rolling, right? Yeah. You never get nervous that somebody's figuring this out? The number of Ivy League titles and championships I've racked up in my 24 years of coaching at Yale the Great and Mighty? I'm pretty high up on the trust ladder. This something you do on your own? Morrie, Morrie, don't go so fast. This one's on my own, but sometimes I work with a guy named Rick Singer in LA. Ever met him? No. You ever hear of Rick Singer? No. Look, we all want the same thing, right? For Danny to come out on top. So are we all ready to move forward? Yes. Danny? You too? 'Cause how you're going, it's not just Stanford that's at risk, it's all the other places you're applying to down to the safes. So, are you with us? Yes. Okay. Uh, now there's going to be a little screw tightening, just the common sense kind. So Danny. We want you to stay in until your grades improve, especially in Algebra and Bio. Wait, um, uh, are you grounding me? It's not punishment. No but this is screwed up, because I'm... I'm playing the Airliner next Thursday. Do you know how long I've been trying to make that happen? That can be rescheduled. We are serious about this. Yeah, and if you can't live with that, we're prepared to take away your guitar and your recording gear. Okay? Hi, Daddy. I hope that wall behind me is out of focus. I do not want you screen grabbing it and selling my entire plot on the black market in Malaysia. Is there a black market for novels? Only brilliant ones. [laughs] I read the first chapter six times a week. Oh, my god, when Ethan finds the robin's nest, it makes me cry every time. Will you send me more? Oh yeah. For the price of a visit. The second that school's out. Well, that would make me supremely happy. Now, are you supremely happy, my angel? I'm good. Father's ears sense they aren't hearing the entire story. What troubles your soul, my love? I don't know, Dad. Um... There's just things that I'm not certain about. Well, maybe that's because you're signing into your mother's machine made, consumer indexed idea of what certainty is, when in fact the entire concept of certainty might be entirely overrated. So tell me, what's the problem and how can papa help? There's no problem. Really. I'm... I'm good. I actually have a ton of homework to do, so I should probably go. Talk to you tomorrow. I love you. I love you too. Bryan, you're here. Yeah, I got a later flight, I wanted to see you one more... Yo! Dude. Yo, listen, 'kay. So we can move into the two bedroom on Dwight in January, but if we drag in Megan and Priyanka, we can get ourselves the big place on Wister Square and get the hell out of the Yale dorms. Yes, I knew you'd say that, man. This calls for Pimm's Cup all around the second I get back. Woohoo, let's go! Come on, Emma! You gotta kick here. Come on, let's go! Come on, Emma! Right now. Kick it higher! Let's go. I want you to put fruit in there. Faster and higher. Let's back it up. One, two, three. Higher and faster. Yes! I don't think my soccer matches are a picnic for my mom. I mean, who wants to hear the other team calling their supposedly sweet little girl names like "killer," and "monster," and "agent of death?" [laughs] Sorry Mom, but I wear those titles like a queen wears a crown. I can't believe I wrote that. [laughs] Well, you can thank my team. Now, did the shrink send you the letter about the extra time? I got it today. Okay, when you send it on, specify that you need to take the test in Houston, because the place I use in West Hollywood is booked that day. Well, what reason do I give? Anything. You're there for a family wedding, Bar Mitzvah. They don't care. So now, I call my test guy. He's Harvard, total genius. Can pinpoint it right to the number we want. Can the number be 1540? Down, girl. A 500 point jump is a humongous red flag. Let's target 1450. With That and the soccer recruitment, that's more than enough. See? Hold up, hold up. [phone rings] Where we going now, boss? I've got three new ones for you in Houston. All right. All right, kids. So the trick here, if you didn't know already, is for you all not to get the same answers right and wrong. So. For this first one, why don't you go "C," you two go "B." How did it go? Oh, my god, if people had any idea this was possible. Shh, shh! [laugh] Yo, Danny. You killed it tonight. You killed it so bad, I'm surprised we don't hear sirens. I owe it to all my fans. I'll be seein' ya. Good night. ♪ Woah. The rents. Probably wondering where the prodigal son has got himself to. Oh, we know where you got yourself to. Oh, well great. Saves us the Q and A. Peace out. You are so high. [laughs] Almost as high as you were when you got kicked out of Disneyland for jumping out of the boat in Pirates of the Caribbean. Okay. I should've never told you that story. But that is irrelevant, because you have a Bio test in less than six hours, and that counts as... What? What? What percentage of the grade? Do you know it to the decimal point? You knew the consequences of breaking the rules that we set out for you. Danny? Dad? Danny. Okay. What do Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan have in common, besides being geniuses? And David Bowie, Bruno Mars, Louis Armstrong. What do they all have in common? None of them went to Stanford! Or any college at all. Danny! Danny!! Come back here! [sighs] [death metal music blaring] ♪ [knocking] Turn that off! Danny! Turn that off! The police will be here! Can you believe it? -Are you serious? -No! I know. That's amazing. It's incredible. It's... it's everything. Hi! Someone just have a baby? Guess how much Emma's SAT score went up? Guess? 400 points? 380. Is that not dazzling? Well, if that's not dazzling, I don't know what is. -That's good, right? -It's amazing! Okay, sure. Let 'em have their continuance. They don't have a case. In a month, they still won't have a case. Craig wants you in meeting room A, partners' meeting. What's going on? We just learn Jeff Bezos is a client? Better. You know a little thing called "getting into Princeton?" Shawn? Ha, ha! My son and heir got in early. [cork pops] People donate millions for gyms and libraries to get their kids into college all the time. Is this any different than that? Yes, it is. No, it isn't. And what about SAT training and tutors, and affording better schools from pre-K on up? It's all the same thing. I mean, is there anything you wouldn't do for Danny? Anything in the world? Nothing. He's losing his way, Jackson. He needs us. [sighs] Parents are supposed to do anything they can for their kids. There isn't any limit to that. There shouldn't be a limit. (Rick) And to think I was afraid we were pushing them on this one. Don't admire it too long. Gotta get this baby in the bank. Put it to work. [phone rings] Hello? Okay, if we do this, there's a condition. A big one. Danny can never know about this, ever. Is that doable? That's the case with many of our families. It's good that way. Kids think they did it themselves. Gives them confidence. There's one thing I don't get. What happens when he gets there and he doesn't show up for sailing? You send a note over the summer saying he had an injury, plantar fasciitis. We'll work all that out. [sighs] So... Okay, I make a cheque payable to your foundation? I'll have my accountant handle the details. Okay. Jackson and I will call you later and we'll talk about the next steps. Okay. [sighs] How does he know a coach will be receptive and not turn him in? Is it just the coach who doesn't feel he's getting enough money or credit? Just endless hounding to raise more cash for his sport? Rick hears enough complaining, he makes his move. I can't speak for any other coaches. Is the illegal stuff just Yale, just families in southern California? I can't speak for any other regions or any other family. Well, he doesn't have to. Just check his client list. My bet is, if we tap Singer's phone, it'll blow our minds. Yeah. Kids into Stanford, Georgetown, tons and tons into USC. From Morrie Tobin to Coach Meredith, to Rick Singer. How does it feel to be the match that burns down a forest? What grade were we in when I first said I wanted to do engineering at Stanford? I don't know, how weird were you? Six, maybe seven? Fourth. Because I heard Willie Hewlett went there. Wow. You're a double legacy, and you could give a shit. And me? I got nothin'. You've got a 4.1 GPA, and 5s in all your APs. So do 70 percent of the people who apply. [phone notification beeps] [gasps] (Caroline) Oh, how about this? He's moving the barbecue. A little more effort. (Rick) Yeah, we could flip this and make it work. I'll have my office give it a try. Oh, shoot. Hey, honey. [door closes] Hey. -Hey! -Come here. Is there a meeting I didn't know about? No, just going over some new stuff. You're not going to believe it. That gig I got publicly executed for playing last week? Devon Blake was there. He's this huge manager, he got Jesse Reed started. Anyway, he has a bunch of ideas on things I should be doing, stuff I could change. But he wants to rep me. Oh, wow. Wow. Actually, one of his guys here recorded my whole set and put it on a flash drive. Want to hear it? Oh, that's so great, honey. But just be careful, okay? Careful about what? Well, I mean, I mean, it's wonderful. But just, so many people around here make so many promises. Young people get preyed on. So just don't sign anything until I have a look at it, okay? He's this huge manager, and he loved what I did, and he wants to take me on. How can you not see how cool that is? Oh my god, honey, it's so cool. It's wonderful, we're so happy for you. We're, we're just trying to protect you. Okay. What new stuff? Talking about your favourite topic with this round of SATs. Yeah. So, Rick has lined up a psychologist to meet with you, um, to see if we can get a letter saying that you need extra time for the test. What are you talking about? Why would they give me extra time? [clears throat] Well, look at everything we've learned about you. Off the charts IQ, trouble with tests, trouble keeping your butt in the chair, I mean, if that's not undiagnosed ADHD, what is? Right, and the doctor can meet with you Wednesday, this Wednesday at 4:30 in Westwood, so, is that good for you? Yeah. You know, the way you say that, it's like I have a choice. It's okay. It's okay. You wanted to see me? Yes. Have a seat. I'm not in trouble, am I? I'm not sure. I got a call from Yale, asking why your application was all about soccer when you haven't played any soccer in high school. I'll have to say, I'm curious myself. 'Cause that's a summer thing. Hmm. Well, they're seeming to want some more documentation on that activity. Great. I'll talk to my mom. She has all the stuff, okay? Okay. Bethany, it's going to be okay. It's not okay. How are you going to get us out of this? It's nothing I haven't dealt with 100 times before. Rick. It really scares me that you are not answering my question. You never once said that anything like this was possible, and you swore to us that this was airtight. Bethany, we've got this. You know why? We got the secret weapon, and that is you. Bethany, calm down. I'm calm. Please. I'm with you. I want to help. I promise. Well, I'm really glad to hear that. It's just the fact that this clueless college counsellor missed the fact that Emma goes to France every summer to play on the National Youth Soccer Team, so that it doesn't get in the way of her schoolwork during the year. It's just that I was on the search committee that hired you to run the place, it's just that I was Chair of the committee that raised all the money to build the music building that you got all the credit for, it's just that I have a daughter who would be just as happy at another overpriced school as she is here, unless you tell that clueless counsellor not to stand in the way of something my daughter has dreamed about all her life. Am I making myself clear? Repeat after me. 7, 24, 19, 11, 9. 7, 24, 19, 11, 9. Okay. Great. All done. I will put this in the system right away, results should be on the site in 10 days. Cool, thanks. Mm-hmm. It wasn't too boring, watching me fill the bubbles? That's the gig. Take care. Thanks. ♪ She didn't just apologize, she begged my forgiveness for ever doubting my daughter. She grovelled. It was gorgeous. That is awesome news. Well, I'm probably going to regret this, 'cause you might try to charge me more money. But you are worth every penny of the half million that I paid you. (Rick) So once we get this in the bag, we get to work on Taylor, right? (Bethany) Taylor's another ball of wax. She's smart enough not to need this, but you, Rick, you're a genius. Well, tell friends. Just don't tell them too much. No way in hell. Great job, son. How did I... That's like 350 points better! [laughing] No, 385! If I did that good, maybe I should, I should take it again. Like, blow the roof off! No, no, no, no, no, no. That's fine, that's better than fine. You're good. Does that get the embargo lifted? Of course. Sure. -Yes. -Yes. Yes, yes! Devon wanted me to do the open mic at the hotel cafe this Sunday, he's going to bring all these people to hear me, I... I gotta... I gotta call him! Go, yes! That is amazing news, Caroline. Oh, I know. I mean, he was walking on air. [laughs] See? It's always that way. It gives them confidence, and they feel great about themselves. [trunk slams] ...I'm just so excited. Listen, I've got some people here. I gotta go. Oh, right, yeah. Okay. Well, thank you so much for everything. [police siren wails] The foundation endeavors to provide education that would normally be unattainable to underprivileged students. To how many underprivileged students did your foundation provide education? Not directly, but um... I want an answer, not an excuse. The foundation isn't set up to directly fund underprivileged students. Some of the moneys are paid to athletic departments for use in their programs, which include support for the underprivileged. And the rest? Where did that go? Your personal account? The personal accounts of athletic coaches? We don't have to answer that. Okay. Let's go to the charges. Mail fraud. Honest services mail fraud. Racketeering. There's a case to be made for 20 years. Racketeering is illegal. (Rick) That's what we call the side door. (Man) Getting my kid recruited for a sport he doesn't play competitively? (Rick) Yeah, on this path, you pay 250. It goes into my foundation, and the kicker is it's a 501(c)3, so you can write off every dime. What are you asking us for? Cheques came from the Isaacsons, and the Kaplins. Got 'em both in the foundation, they'll clear tomorrow. Sounds good. So, here's the deal. The yacht is now in Mykonos, and they want you to see it before you start work. But I thought I saw it in St. Barts. He says he wants to make sure that the colours in the main salon work with the light of the Mediterranean. Oh. [phone rings] Hey, Rick. What's going on? I want you to be the first person I called about something that's going on. I just wanted to give you the heads up that my foundation is being audited. Should I uh?... What... what do you mean, "audited"? They're going over our payments, including the payment for 100k that you made to have Mark Riddell take the SAT for Danny. [sighs] This is scaring me. There's no reason it should. It's totally routine, I just... I was calling to make sure that you and I are on the same page. Because of course I wouldn't tell the IRS that you paid 150k to have an athletic coach at Stanford recruit your son for a sport he didn't play. So in case you get a call, you know. Why would I get a call? Well... Audits, foundations, that's... that's what they do. So in case you get a call, you're going to say that the $250,000 total that you paid to our foundation was to help underserved kids, and you're not going to say what it was really for. I'll just say that... that I was inspired by your helping underprivileged kids get into college. That's excellent. This is not making me happy. But you'll be happy when you get your letter from Stanford, and you find out that the 250k was worth it for Danny. Agreed? Agreed. Anyway, 99 percent chance you don't hear from anybody, so we'll talk soon, okay? Yeah. Okay. Uh, Kaplan. [phone rings] Hey, Rick. Gordon, hey. I'm calling to give you the heads up my foundation is being audited. Do you think that I'm some kind of a moron that I am going to tell the IRS that I paid you to cheat on my daughter's SATs? I'm just dotting my I's. I'm just going to tell them that I made the donation to your foundation and where the money went from there, I know nothing about. That's perfect. Okay. While I have you on the phone, Emma is on spring break and I am just going out of my mind waiting to hear, and I know that you're not supposed to say anything, but I also know that you're five steps ahead of any game that you're playing. So, is Emma in at Yale or not? Basically, Emma was in the second the athletic team vouched for her. Oh my god! Slow down, slow down, I'm not supposed to tip that, so. Can't tell a soul. Just you, okay? [p Hey, mom. Welcome to the party. Hey, honey! Hey Beth. Uh, want a gin and tonic? I'm just calling to say that by rights, it should be champagne, and you have to totally keep this on the QT right now, but honey, you got in. You're going to Yale! Oh my god, oh my god! [laughing] Oh my god! We're going to school together! I love you so...! Listen, I know this is ancient history. I mean, the boy's, what, a junior at Georgetown now? But I appreciate knowing I can count on you to say the right thing if the IRS calls. Thank you. [phone rings] Hello, Caroline. Don't get mad at Bethany, she didn't want to tell us. We practically had to beat her up to get it out of her, but we heard about Emma. And I know you know who's in and who isn't, so if you know about Danny, please tell us now, because we are practically jumping out of our skin. I'm happy to discreetly inquire.

You made for some historic television this morning. Okay, before you say anything, I want to assure you that no shade is going to fall on this firm, and I take full responsibility for overstepping in my zeal, as any mother would. So I've booked off the afternoon, and I'm going to call the big clients, and I don't think anybody's going to care how Emma got her test scores. Our recommendation is that you speak with Maggie. What the hell, Tom? Are you my partner of 18 years, or are you some parrot trained by HR? It's best that we talk in my office. You're of course free to consult legal counsel at any time, but it's our suggestion that you hear us out first.

Exactly. I wouldn't tell the IRS that, because I didn't do it. Come on, Bethany. You... you know that a... a jury will likely hear that differently. The prosecution will argue that it's strongly implied. I'm not pleading guilty. Rick led like crazy on that call, and I never once for a second followed.

For doing anything I could to help my child? That's not something I'm going to apologize for. Allan, thank you so much for being honest and upfront about how you see this. I'm going to seek counsel with the balls to stand up to a lynch mob. Works for me. This isn't just about what law you have or haven't broken. What you've done to Emma. Allan. Could they go after Emma? I don't know if she'll be indicted or not. We may not know for a while. But could it happen? I have no crystal ball. I wish you the best of luck. Allan. Allan! [sighs] It's a nightmare we're never going to wake up from. It's going to go on and on. I can't believe this is actually happening to us. It's not something that's happening to us. It's something that you made happen. What? Are you really going to do that? You're going to go there? You're going to blame this on me? You pushed us, you dragged us... I dragged you? What are you talking about? You could've stopped it at any moment. You're the lawyer, you knew the consequences! Like I didn't try! I told you that this was fraud. I said "this is a serious crime." Oh, come on Jackson! You jumped in as deeply as I did, the minute you found out your boss's kid got into Princeton! You're right about one thing. This is a nightmare. Do you have any idea how bad this is?! I mean, right now it's mail fraud, but if they slip in money laundering, that is real time. [sighs] How could that happen? Could we go to prison? It depends on what we do now. What do we do now? I don't know. I don't know anything anymore. [sighs] Stupid. Stupid! Stupid, stupid, stupid! Stupid! [sobbing] It's your only hope. Do you know what that means? We plead guilty to a felony, I lose my license. Not a lawyer anymore. It's horrible, I know. But the alternative. [sighs] It keeps hitting me in waves. Everything that's gone. You're young, time passes. People forget and forgive. Look at Martha Stewart. I want to do it. I want to plead guilty. I want to beg for forgiveness of everybody. It's our only hope. Of what? Of being able to walk outside our house. Of our son ever speaking to us again. You're sure of this? What will they do to us? The sentence is going to have a lot to do with how contrite the judges think you are. [sighs] We're all exhausted. Maybe we should talk tomorrow first thing. Okay. We'll get through this.

Beautiful. [door slams] Sweetheart? You swore nobody would ever know. You said this could never happen. I am so sorry. At least now I know what you think of me. I love you. Let me see, what was it? Something like, "I won't have to do this for Taylor, "she's smart, not like her moron sister." I was kidding. It was a joke. It was just something that I was saying to Rick! You were right. I am a moron, for letting you talk me into this. I thought that I was helping you get what you wanted. Who even knows what that is? I only know what you've told me to want my whole life. Are blueberries even my favourite food, or is that just something you programmed into me because of the blueberry parfaits at my stupid fifth birthday party with the stupid clowns on the stupid blue ponies?

No. No. If you say one more word about how you did it for me, you will never see me again. You did it for one reason, so you could have something to say at cocktail parties that would make your friends jealous. That is not true. It can join the billion other things flying around that aren't true. Oh please, Danny. Please, please don't go. How could you do it? How could you lie to me for months? I mean, would it have been so terrible if I had worked as a waiter and I played in clubs? What would've been so terrible if I had... if I had failed at that, if I had starved? I would've figured something out. Sorry I wasn't the son you wanted. [sighs] Oh... You are the son I've adored since the moment I felt the first kick. You're perfect. Oh, Danny. Danny. [phone ringing] Hi, Allan. If you're calling to yell at me some more, this door is closed. I'm making this call as a courtesy, to tell you something not very good, I'm afraid. Your partners are firing you for cause, and I've been notified that they're exercising their right to take your equity. I'm going to fight it. That's a mountain of legal. It's a good thing you have properties you can liquidate. Your... your house, the place in Aspen... [laughs] Why are you laughing? [laughter] Because it's all just all such a gorgeous joke. I mean, everything is leveraged against the equity. Peter borrowed from Paul so many times he didn't know which apostle he was anymore, but I know what I am going to do.

I know you were part of a terrible thing. Then why are you here? Because you inherited enough twisted genes from me to account for a lifetime of terrible. That's no excuse. Not on its own, maybe. But if you throw in being 17... No, it's still not enough. Bryan treated me like a disease, because I am one. No college will take me, and they shouldn't. Any job I ever want, they're going to look me up and... I just want to die. Right now. I want to stop breathing and die. Hey, listen. There's only one thing that you can do, and that is live better.
