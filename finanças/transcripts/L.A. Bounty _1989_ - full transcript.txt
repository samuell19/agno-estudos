(lion roaring) (gentle music) (upbeat music) - Law and order candidate Mike Rhodes and his wife have just left the hotel after what, by all appearances, has been a very successful fundraiser. Our polls show Rhodes gaining on incumbent Mayor John Burrows. And Kelly Rhodes, the wealthy ex-model wife of Mike Rhodes, was responsible for many of the show business personalities who were here tonight. Of course, we'll be keeping you updated on all the events on our mayoral campaign. This is Frazer Kelly for Action News, Channel 3. - Well? What do you think? - I thought you were wonderful. Sure you doubled your votes. - Mm. - At least with the women. - Now, Kelly, we've talked about this. (Kelly chuckles) - Coming up in just a moment on Channel 3 Action News. (gentle music) - [Kelly] lt's the price l pay for marrying the sexiest politician in the world. - [Mike] You bet. - Oh, boy. - Champagne? (Mike chuckles) (cork pops) (champagne fizzles) - To Mike Rhodes, the next mayor of Los Angeles. (glasses clinking) - Kelly, you're so beautiful. L'm a lucky guy. (window whirring) I have been waiting to be alone with you all night. (Kelly chuckles) Did you know that? - No. - Well, l have. (crickets chirping) (gentle music) I got it, pal. I got it. Oh, my dear, yes. - [Kelly] Thank you so much, sir. (Kelly chuckles) - Let's go. - The door. - Oh, l see we didn't close the door. (door thuds) (gentle music) (door crashes) (Mike gasps) What? (Kelly groans) (Mike groans) Who the hell are you guys? (Mike groans) (guns thudding) (Mike groaning) - [Kelly] Mike! (Kelly grunts) - what the fuck?! (Kelly groans) waste the bitch. Come on. Come on. (guns firing) (sparks crackling) (mirror crashing) (suspenseful music) (gun clacking) (gun fires) (man groans) (sparks crackling) (gun fires) (man groans) (gun clacking) (siren wailing) (tires screeching) (officer grunts) (gun clacking) - Holy shit. (hangers raftling) Police! Come oufta there! Now! - They took Mike. They took Mike. - [Model] Think Ood's bored? Why would he be bored? - If you knew everything that was gonna happen, wouldn't you be bored too? Huh? l mean, where's the buzz in that? - It wouldn't bore me. l'd make a fortune at the track. - Well, Ood does not need a fortune. What Ood needs is a little entertainment. I mean, that's what we're here for. You understand? It's Fred fucking Astaire time. That's entertainment. - What do you mean? - What do l mean, what do l mean, what do l mean? I mean, l mean, l mean that Ood fixed it so he never knows what we're gonna do. And our whole job's to play his liftle games to keep him amused. We turn him on, he turns us on. That's all it is, turn on, it's symbiotic. You think Ood wants to spend eternity with 144,000 chosen few who are all good people? No, he wants to be with thieves, artists, killers, painters. That's why it's important we use our imaginations. - You have some funny ideas. (both chuckling) - Yeah. Don't you? I mean, look at yourself, you're naked. (both chuckling) (van horn honking) (remote beeps) (machine beeping) (garage whirring) All right, that's enough for today. Put your clothes on. - [Model] Can l see it? - In your dreams. Oo on, go on. Oet some sleep. How'd it go? - [Jackman] Cops came. we left two behind. - They get out? - I didn't wait around. (Mike groans) (alcohol splashes) - Morning, Mike. I just wanted to welcome you here and l hope you have a real pleasant stay with us. You all right? You okay? (Mike groans) Martin, why don't you get him a couple of aspirin and cook him an omelet or something? (Mike groans) Rand, see you later. - I just- - No, no, no. I said l'd see you. - Yeah, but- - Thank you. Come here. Come on. What happened to your nose? - Rhodes's old lady. - She get a look at you? - I don't think so. - You don't think so. - Police forensic teams have apparently finished going over the scene of the early morning aftack and kidnapping of mayoral candidate Mike Rhodes. Incumbent Mayor John Burrows expressed shock when told of the kidnapping. Okay, folks, lots of closeups for the 11 o'clock. This is a good one. - Mrs. Rhodes? Mrs. Rhodes? - Excuse us. L'm Lieutenant Rosario. This is Sergeant Perry. I know this is very hard, but we need your help. - Who are they? Why are they doing this? - Well, we won't know until they make a call. In the meantime, we're going to have someone here monitoring your telephone. - They're going to kill him, aren't they? - Mrs. Rhodes, if they were gonna do that, they would have done it last night. - They tried to kill me. - Mrs. Rhodes, excuse me. L'd like to tell you something. (Rosario sighs) You are very brave. No, l mean it. What you did is going to help us catch these people and return your husband. I would like you to go downtown, give the police artist as good a description as you can so we can come up with a composite, all right? Are you up to that? - Oh, Ood. When? - Well, tomorrow, the very latest. Sergeant Perry here, he'll come by for you, first thing. - Maybe we can stop by campaign head9uarters on the way in. - It's a good idea, actually. Yeah, tomorrow is Sunday, there won't be anyone there. Perhaps you could look through some of your husband's papers? You know, something could jog your memory, an address, a name he might have mentioned, anything that can give us a lead. All right? - Yes. All right. - Are you okay? - Oh, Lieutenant, l want my husband back. - I know. We do too. (door rumbling) - Well, come on! Let's get it unloaded! (forklift whirring) (wood creaking) - Shit. - Nice. - [Jackman] Let's cut it. Oet it on the streets. - You owe me a kilo. (Cavanaugh chuckles) - Lighten up, Martin. L'm sorry, it's my fault, all right? Okay? Oo ahead. Oh, listen, stay in touch. I might need you for something else, okay? - Hey, l ain't going nowhere. - Oood job. You know, l'd never cheat you, and l believe you know that. - Yeah, l know. - [Cavanaugh] Stay well. (door clacks) (door thuds) - Still the same old charm, hm? - Yeah. Same old game, Jimmy, isn't it? Hm? - Millionaire caftle rancher, Leonardo Sebriez, is now serving 1 0 years in prison for cocaine trafficking, and is suspected in the slaying of an American drug agent, was sentenced Monday to an additional three years in prison for jumping bail in 1 980. And a 20-foot tall bronze statue honoring merchant seamen who served in wartime was mounted on its base Monday in front of the Los Angeles Maritime Museum in San Pedro. The 2,1 00-pound statue, which depicts two merchant marines climbing a Jacob's ladder, fell over, crushing several... And in sports, Tommy Lasorda goes on a diet. (dramatic music) - You okay? Huh? What do you think, Jimmy? What do we do now? - [Jimmy] You're crazy, Cavanaugh. Just waste him. Why does everything have to be a game with you? - [Cavanaugh] Because everything is a game, Jimmy. It's all a game. what, you wanna do it? - [Jimmy] with a damn gun. - [Cavanaugh] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on, get back. You're not playing, right, so you lose your turn. - [Jimmy] Just hurry up. (Cavanaugh humming) (gun fires) (officer groans) (gun firing) (officer groaning) Iftery music) - Ouch. - Still no word today from kidnappers who abducted mayoral candidate Mike Rhodes after last night's fundraiser. While the lightning attack so far has police baed, Mrs. Rhodes did manage to get a look at one of the attackers. She'll be working with police artists to put together a composite of the man she says led the assault on her home. And this Monday in Los Angeles, once again, it's Burrito Day. (switch click) - So, she didn't see you, huh? - What are we gonna do? - We? My friend, you are gonna waste her. - Jesus, Cavanaugh, she's got cops all around her. - Ah. Well, that is why Ood gave you the power of the imagination. Use it. (gentle cymbal music) (upbeat music) - Dammit. (tires screeching) - What's with this guy? (willis screams) Oet down! (gun fires) (Perry groans) (tires screeching) (car crashes) - Finish it. (Kelly groans) (tires screeching) (gate crashes) (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun clicking) (gun firing) (willis groaning) (Jackman grunts) (tires screeching) - Oet in! (upbeat music) (gun fires) (tires screeching) (cars crashing) (gun thudding) (gun fires) (vehicles crashing) (gun thudding) (vehicles crashing) (Bogner screams) (vehicles crashing) (people screaming) (car horns honking) - Tell Cavanaugh- - Cavanaugh? (gun clicks) l haven't seen Cavanaugh... - You want Kelly Rhodes? You deal with me. (sirens wailing) - [Jackman] Look, Ruger, l wouldn't even know where to get ahold of him, and even if l could, l mean- - You tell Cavanaugh to call me. 6:00 a.m. (Jackman sighs) (gun clacking) - You're lefting him go? Who are these people? (glove compartment door thuds) (engine rumbling) (Jackman sighs) - I don't want excuses. I want results. Whoever this is, he's making you look like idiots, and that makes me look like an idiot. - I lost a good man today, sir. - I know that. But, look, l'm under a lot of pressure. I mean, there are lunatics out there that think that l kidnapped Rhodes. What about this other person, the one that shot the punks? - We don't know. - We don't know where Mike Rhodes is, we don't know where Kelly Rhodes is, and now, there is some maniac vigilante out there. - Mayor, we're doing the best that we can. I mean, let's face it, we have nothing until they make the contact. - All right. Keep me posted. - Yes, sir. - [Cavanaugh] where are Bogner and willis? - Dead. - [Cavanaugh] The cops? - Ruger. - Excuse me? - [Jackman] Ruger! (Cavanaugh chuckles) - I want to know how she got so close to me, you understand? - Hell, l don't know! Last l heard, she was in Florida. - Florida? (Cavanaugh chuckles) Rand was in Florida, wasn't he? - Rand's a stand-up guy. - Bullshit. Everybody's got their price, even you, Jackman, am l right? Huh? Well, you dig that son of a bitch up and you bring him here. Oet out! (Cavanaugh chuckles) Uh-oh. (door clacks) - Where are we? (Kelly sighs) (switch clicks) What is this? (door thuds) You live here? - The bed's yours. - L'm not sleeping here. I want to go home. I don't even know who you are. L'll scream for help. (Kelly sighs) (switch clicks) (Kelly sighs) Jerk. (paintbrush scratching) - Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. (elegant music) Oh, the magic, the magic, hm? Huh? Hold still right there. Don't move. Lift your chin, lift. There. There. Beautiful. Oorgeous. Ood, yes. (remote beeps) (Cavanaugh chuckles) Shh. Don't move, don't move. Beautiful. I think that's it for today. Why don't you just disappear? Ooodnight.

(Rand chuckles) Everything all right? - Oreat, fine. - Everything okay? - Yes. - Oood. - Uh-huh. - Oood, good. How about if l buy you a drink? - That'd be great. - So how's your father? I heard he was in the hospital, sick. - Oh, he's much better. - That's good. Next time you see him, l want you to give him my best. - [Rand] l will. - Oood. (bottle crashes) (Rand groaning) Oh. Ooh.

Now, you and l both know you talked to Ruger, right? - No, no. - It's okay. l don't care. I just want to know what you told her. - I just said that you were in L.A., that's it. I swear. - No, no, no, no, no. You tipped her off about the Rhodes job, otherwise she wouldn't have been there, right? - No. - [Cavanaugh] Uh-uh. How much did she pay you? Hm? (hand slaps) How much did she pay you? - She threatened to kill me. - Oh, jeez. Yeah, l know. Rand, she conned you. - No, no, no, she'd have done it. - No, you see, she doesn't like killing people in cold blood. It's something in her personality. I got to tell you, she made a real rough on me a couple of years ago, oh, yeah. I mean, she made it so tough on me that l had to leave my beloved country and go hide out in South America, fighting off mos9uitoes as big as your goddamn fist! And then l come back here and l think it's safe. And now, it's just a mafter of time before she finds out where l am. And you know what l'd appreciate? L'd appreciate if you felt a liftle sorrow. Are you sorry?! - L'm sorry. - Are you sorry?! - I swear to Ood, l'm sorry. L'm sorry. L'm sorry.

Ruger? - She was a street kid. Apparently never knew her father. Her mother died of an overdose when Ruger was about 11 or 12. And maybe that's why she became a narcotics cop, huh? - You knew her. - Everybody knew Ruger. She had her own way of dealing with things. (Kelly sighs) - You can say that again. - Well, anyway, it finally caught up with her. Oh, yeah, she went way out of bounds on a drug case. - Cavanaugh. - That's right. Her partner was killed.
