Music: "Una furtiva lagrima" from I'elisir d'amore by romani Frankie, vo: In my job, you lose more time than you win. I'm not afraid of losing but as long as /'vs done things night. You have to become a psychiatrist of horses. Get inside their heads. You've got to bond with the animal and be part of one. So he can pen'orm at his very best You get the one you have to bully the one that you've got to give a pat the one you have to give flowers the one you have to shout at. ♪ Una furtiva iagrima ♪ It's not like a piece of metal then you turn the key and you drive it, this is a living creature what feels how you feel. Irode over 3,000 winners... And then you stumble to a horse like ”enable” emotionally she's taken me to places that other horses cou/dn 't and you know, it's an amazing journey. Commentator: And Frankie's gone for home at the 300 and she finds two lengths "enable", the queen of Europe! Frankie, vo: What happens when that happens, you... You get touched even more. You fell in love with them. I think this time / feel it more than / ever did. I will have a city mouth and my heart will be pumping but, hey, I can't stop that the same thing happened last year but last year was a myste/y. Commentator: And it's "enable" two lengths clear followed by "sea of class". He's still coming, "enable". Wow, "enable" may have just held on. "Enable" joins the pantheon of greats. The duel arc winner... But boy, what a finale. Frankie, vo: The great thing about ”enable ” it's kept people watching racing... Alright? And it's given people something to fol/o w. You know, she's a household name. She's a great champion. And also you want to push the boundaries we 're going to fly to do something that no horse ever done in recent histo/y... To fly to win three arcs. And I have a knot in my throat when I'm talking about it because it's more for her, you know. I want her to be remembered as one of the all—time greats. ♪ Cielo! Si puo morir! ♪ Frankie, vo: / want to give the public something to remember, that's it. I told you it was chaos! ♪ Di piu non chiedo ♪ ♪ non chiedo ♪ ♪ ah, cielo! ♪ ♪ Si puo, si puo morir ♪ "Good luck?" — yes, yes. ♪ Di piu non... ♪ ♪ ...chiedo ♪ Music stops reporter: The prix de I'arc de triomphe, it is the preeminent end—of—season championship. Reporter 2: Big race on Sunday we're all talking about "enable". Reporter 3: The best jockey in the world the best horse in the world right now. Reporter 4: Frankie dettori will be widely viewed as one of the best jockeys of the modern era. And Frankie now knows "enable" like the back of his hand and they've fought many a battle together. Reporter 5: Now if she won a third arc she would be rightly considered a racing immortal. Frankie, vo: Lusually like to leave quite early... Even if that means I'i/ be there at 72:00. Who cares? At least arrive there in a good frame of mind. I'll probably go and see the filly... Talk to the lad... And then, usually me and John, about one o 'clock we walk the track. By this stage we already... Have a plan in mind. I'i/ be honest with you, it's just to give us a little bit of peace and quiet... And then it's that last hour, then you... Once you give the saddle away, you just... You know, minutes are like hours. That last 20 minutes, you just think ”god! I want to get out. I want to get out, I want to get out”. Crowd applauds and cheers once you get out of the room it's like a gladiator comes out in the ring. Just eve/ything goes away and you smell the atmosphere, and live it... Enjoy it... And eve/ybody be staring at me. He laughs cameras stuck in your face. Yeah, I'm used to that now. Listen, / 'd rather it be like that than have no one looking at me/ that means I'm the important one. The favourite. I'm the one eve/ybody wants to win. John: Right, we'd better go and find the filly, old boy. Just ride it the way it comes up. It's number one for me. Ok? Off we go, they're giving me a nudge to put you up. — I'll see you later. Indistinct chati'er Frankie, vo: And then, lsee... People's faces are more nen/ous than me/ so, that makes me feel calm... Because I'm actually the one doing it. So why are you guys nen/ous? Cos I'm the one on it/ that's it and then eve/ything goes away once / get on the horse. Frankie: Hi, hi. — man shouts: Come on Frankie! Crowd yells and cheers Frankie, vo: It's the best feeling, you know. Eve/ybody's watching you some people are clapping, shouting my name and... Great, and/ fly to take it all in and enjoy it. Shouting continues I'm riding the best horse in the world. I'm flying to make histo/y. Eve/ybody wants to shoot me down, basically. You know, whoever beats me wins, basically. That's the way they look at it. And then we go across the track and we face the grandstand and there'll be 40,000 people and it's part and parcel of the arc. If you don't enjoy then what's the point doing it? Crowd clamours ”enable ” herself, people get behind her. She's the horse that eve/ybody wants to come and see and that creates pressure. Of course the trainer does his best and the groom and the stable staff but at the end of the day you know, when we get to the races and it's 40, 000 people it's just me and her, you know... And that bond is special because it's a fantastic pressure to ha ve. The buzz you get when they let you go to go to the start and eve/ybody's cheering and ”enable”, she carts you to the start like an hovercraft, you think... Can't get any better than this. Great, it's amazing, amazing feeling. This is the arc. Ok, let's get it on. Commentator: Racing away "soft light" is the slowest one of them to break into stride 2400 metres, a mile and a half in front of them get to settle down. "Ghaiyyath" in the blue colours. He's bit warm beforehand and he's moved through to show out in front. Frankie on "enable", she's about three off the running now. So, downhill now they head down to the home straight. They're well strung out, "enable" is in fourth place but "ghaiyyath" will lead up to the home turn. They have only 600 metres to go "magical" in second. "Enable", she's now poised. She's in second place, she's two lengths behind. So "sottsass" now challenges "waldgeist" behind those. With 300 metres to go, "enable" has the lead. "Sottsass" in the green colours in second. "Waldgeist" the red now, on the outside. They're coming to the last furlong now... And it's "enable" in front. Sheleads. "Waldgeist" in second place is closing down the centre. "Waldgeist" in the red jacket is getting up, he's won! Pierre—charles boudot has won on "waldgeist", beats "enable". Crowd applauds — indistinct chati'er indistinct pa announcement I feel deflated. He sighs gonna just ring my dad. Frankie and step mother speak Italian Gianfranco in Italian Frankie: Gianfranco: Papa, ciao. Frankie: My grandfather was a builder after the war. All the sons in the family just helped out. My dad thought "well, there's more to life than just mixing cement with my family for 12 hours". According to his stories, he said he had a big fall out when he was 18 and uh... Jumped on the ferry and went to Rome. He said he had a pair of jeans and a t—shirt and a packet of cigarettes. That's it. Gianfranco in Italian: Luca cumani: My father was a very successful trainer in Italy and he discovered Frankie's father, gianfranco. My father took him to Milan and very quickly promoted him to number one rider for the stable and that's how it started. Commentator speaks Italian Frankie: My dad had to really work at it, you know. He didn't come from a racing family so he had to do everything from scratch. Cumani: Gianfranco was the best rider of his era in Italy. He was strong. He had a good tactical sense. He had this sort of idea that life's a struggle therefore you must work hard and in order to be seen to work hard you must be serious. Frankie: My dad, one day, went to the circus and that's where he met my mother. Frankie: My mum comes from a family circus which was called circo Russo. She used to stand on two horses. She used to do trapeze. She was a contortionist. You couldn't put the two together really, but yeah... It actually did happen. He chuckles probably love at first sight. My mother only 16 years old, like a natural flower. Fell in love... And they got married. My sister was the first child and my dad was getting more and more successful and powerful and that's where I think it all started to go wrong. I guess it was just after I was born that mum and dad decided that they couldn't live together anymore. Alessandra in Italian Frankie: My sister and I lived with my dad and my stepmother. It was very difficult. Alessandra in Italian: Frankie: Regarding my sister... The thing didn't really work from the beginning with my stepmother. They used to kind of argue every day. Always end up in tears, my sister and I. It would make me cry to see her cry. And every night we used to retire to bed and we used to fall asleep together crying. Alessandra in Italian: Frankie: She always used to say, "oh, right that's it. I've had enough, I'm gonna run away. I'm gonna go back to mum... And then sure enough, one day I came back from school and my sister has run away. So my sister left... And you won't believe it, I only saw dad... Maybe the weekends when he was racing he never took me to school and one day, there he was outside school with this horse box. I couldn't believe my dad picked me up. And he said, "oh, come here". So I climbed into the truck and uh... And then a got the lecture about, "oh, you know your sister she's a bad girl, she's left", ia—ia, ia—ia. And then we drove 20 minutes away to this farm and there were three ponies in the field two bays and a beautiful palomino. Dad said, "pick the one you want". He said, "I'm giving you a present"... Because he'd obviously lost one child and didn't want me to follow suit... And that was it. That's where the love of horses came because I picked this beautiful palomino pony. I used to take all my school mates to watch me ride and that's how I got into racing really. Cumani: I only heard this that Frankie, he wasn't particularly interested in going to school or pursuing an academic career. Gianfranco in Italian: Look, I'll be honest with you. I was useless. You know, I had all the gear and no idea. Even dad, he didn't have much time for me because he was pursuing his own career, so... Obviously every once in a while I rode with him he kinda looked at me like... You know, "what a waste of space" you know what I mean? And I felt... Uh, embarrassed that my dad felt that I was no good. Music: "Clair de lune" by debussy he was intimidating and always aggressive so I was always in my shell. But you know, I was only a kid. I wasn't going to give up, you know... And he challenged me. Probably in those three months, is probably the most I've learned in my life. And then at the end of the winter I mean, he was shocked. Obviously he saw something in me that I couldn't see. So he started to plot my career really... Without telling me, really. And then the bombshell. "Oh, uh... You're going to england." What? Said, "I've got my friends here" "no, no, you're going to england." And it was not "yes or no" but I got a two—hour lecture how I was going to go to england how I was going to be champion jockey how da—da—da—da... I mean it was like pfft... So much and I was heart—broken because... My life was there... Like my friends, the racing, it was all there. Why? Why do I have to go to england? I don't speak English, I don't know anyone there and I was going to... He was gonna send me on my own! Alessandra in Italian: Gianfranco in Italian: I had a tag round by neck... With my name. You know, because I was 14 I was put in a plane from Milan to luton. Somebody picked me up and that was it. It basically was like my life changed. Woman muti'ers Lovely. I just... I don't feel my leg anymore! Camera clicks did I leave my jacket there? Man: No. Pete burrell: Good evening, hi. I'm Pete burrell, would you all please give the warmest welcome of all time not only to the greatest jockey of all time but probably one of the most preeminent sportsmen of our generation. It's Frankie dettori. Audience applauds audience cheers and whistles Frankie: Never ever in my life have I ever had a horse that... When "enable" takes a breath, she actually... Moves my legs cos she's got such big lungs that she... she's amazing and you know look, we came so close last year to do something impossible, to win three arcs in a way, I'm very upset. I'm very glad that she's... She's still with us... Indistinct chati'er next time you see, you're probably taller than me! Crowd laughs I love you... — she laughs thank you. When you see "enable"... — yep. Will you please tell her that we love her? So, I don't mind at all, you know. Oh, and that's my big girl! He kisses — woman chuckles the big girl, "enable". "Enable" herself, she did touch my heart. You know, when you touch the warmth, the people... It's very hard not to show your emotions. But I guess after 30 years, you... You get... You never get used to losing, but you get to accept it. In my professional world unfortunately, when you're out there, you're on your own. So you have to accept it on your own. You can't... of course you can share with other people but nobody will ever understand how you feel. In general, I win one in five, so... The four that you lose... He chuckles if you kill yourself for it every time then you won't be alive. So, yeah you... You put up with it. Ok, you can lose a lot of races but there's that winner what's gonna... Pull you back up. So uh... There is always a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel. It's like going on a treadmill and put it as fast as you can, and you're on it running. It doesn't stop. It's like last year when I rode "enable" unluckily for me, she got beat and it was the middle of the day another three races. I didn't have time to sulk. I had to just brush myself up and go on to the next one, you know. So it's not till after the whole event is finished you can go home and... And reflect and chew about it but then... Back on Monday, you're back on that fast treadmill. And this is the story of my life. You know, it's been like that flat out, all the way... And I'll be honest with you you know, at my age... It's... You gotta be focused because it's relentless. Mad really, thinking about it that I did so much in 30 years that I didn't have time to enjoy half of it because it's nonstop. Man grunts it is like a drug. It's an amazing feeling that you get. You know, you're riding this beautiful animal that does 60k an hour you race within half an inch to each other also with the fear that, you know... If you touch the horse in front you can fall and break your neck. The competition, the adrenaline... The crowd, the smell... That's why you do it. And then, on top of that, if you win... The jubilation, the excitement... The thrill... The applause, the stage... I mean, that's why you do it... Cos all of that, all of that... In a package. Did that make sense? Or just... He laughs music: "All the blood in my heart" by nightgames Reporter: The governor at bedford house is Luca cumani. Cumani's career got a leg up from his father Italy's top trainer. Did you give him one this morning? Man: Yeah, he had one this morning. Cumani: I can imagine how difficult it must have been with him not speaking a word of English and there was nobody, other than myself in the whole of newmarket that spoke Italian. So he didn't, he really had to make virtue of a... Of a bad situation for him. Frankie: When I first came to england, at first I hated it. I'm lonely, I'm in a different country can't speak the language... I've got no friends, I'm getting bullied. The weather is terrible, the food is even worse. I was really homesick. Reporter: The backbone of any racing yard is the men and women they call "stable lads". Frankie: The apprentice job in england consisted of doing all the dirty jobs nobody else wanted to do. You know, we had to sweep all the yards and you know, we had to do all the silly little jobs. Hello, girl. Frankie: Most of the people thought then I was a kid with a silver spoon in my mouth because my dad was a champion jockey in Italy. But it was completely the opposite so I was treated, I must say... Like a foreigner. You know, they used to make fun about me and do all sorts of tricks and uh... Throw me in the muck heap, or punch me or... You know, all those things you do when you're kids. I was only allowed to ring my dad once a week on a Monday. It was tears every Monday. In a sobbing voice: "I want to come home, ahh!" My dad was determined and basically, he just brainwashed me the whole time. You know, "you're gonna become champion." "One day you're gonna be like Lester piggott"... Ia—ia—ia, ia—ia—ia. How can you push a young human being and brainwash him to make him believe he gonna be champion? And what about if something bad would happen? You could ruin somebody's life. You know. I don't... I don't kind of believe in that. Anyway, after three months... Then I started to master a few words, I... "What is this?" High, low, da—da—da, all that. The guys that used to bully me, they became my best friends. And then now I'm late 14, coming towards 15 now hormones are kicking in I'm looking at the girls, I'm chasing 'em, all that. And then the time came up. The six months came up, then I had to go home. And then the reverse happened. I says, "god, I don't want to go home". Go back to my parents, they're so strict. Tell me... Always shouting at me. Where I'm here by myself, I'm having the time of my life! "Dad, you know... You know, do I really have to go home? You know, I'm doing so well", blah—blah—blah and uh, and then he was made up that I wanted to stay. Ray Cochrane: I was the stable jockey at Luca cumani's and I just seen him one morning said, "do you ever use that little kid there? That scrawny—looking kid there with the green helmet on?" "That's gianfranco dettori's son, ray". He says, "well, he sits nice, he rides nice he's a good kid". I said, "what's he like, Jeffrey?" "Oh, he's full of it" he said, "he's full of it!" Cumani: He was a difficult kid to handle. There was no malice in him whatsoever. But he was exuberant. You know, he was off in all directions and wild and doing all sorts of things. Cochrane: He was just, you know, personality coming out of his ears. It was everywhere, you know. He was a good... A real good kid. You could see that he was just so natural with horses. Cumani: The first thing that you notice, horses run for him. They respond to his commands. They do what he asks them to do. Commentator: It's gonna be a battle for second between... There's only one possible champion apprentice this year and I'm pleased to welcome him now. He's Frankie dettori. He's just ridden his 48th winner of the season. Frankie, congratulations, that was very nice and smooth. Yeah, it was. It was very nice. Cochrane: Of course then, Frankie started to get going. And I came in one day and said to my own agent "I don't think we're gonna be in this job a long time, you know". He said, "why's that?" I said, "this kid is gonna be very good". Oh, Italian kid's gonna be good, Italian owners... Italian trainer... I said, "oh, god, I'm not going to be here a long time. I know that much." Newsreader: The lta/ians are struggling to come to terms with this new reality. Reporter: One senior health official said there could at some stage be thousands of cases in the UK. Woman on TV: My mental health is deteriorating because / cannot get these repeat prescriptions. I'm... I'm at my wits' end. I mean, it's beyond a normal coping situation with me... And, I just don't know which way to turn. Frankie: Well, this doesn't look great, does it? Frankie, this is gonna go further than anyone thinks. Newsreader: We have never in peacetime faced an economic fight like this one. I think, everyone you read about who's going under is like your mother, who's got an existing problem you know, that's the... That's the worry, isn't it? You know. So, um... Have you seen the videos of Schwarzenegger in his kitchen with the donkeys? — no. Oh, you've got to see it, it's on Twitter. It's hilarious. Yeah. So what's the plan? So, the plan is, we're gonna have a meeting in the house and then um... — perfect. I don't know, lunch or something, I suppose. Frankie in Italian: Christine deti'ori: Gianfranco in Italian: Frankie in Italian: Frankie: Alessandra in Italian: Frankie in Italian: Alessandra in Italian: Alessandra in Italian: Frankie in Italian: Hodges: Yeah. — Hodges, it says on... It's Pete here, by the way. How are you? Alright? — yep. It says... it says on the thing that it's only uae residents who can't travel out. But you think that's tourists coming in as well, yeah? Hodg es: Yeah, tourists coming in as well, yeah. Alright, ok. Yeah. That's that then, isn't it? So that's if... That... that's us basically... We're stuck. — it's the end of the discussion, isn't it? Right, Pete... Burrell: Good. — let's discuss what we're gonna do in the next six weeks. Burrell: It's a real bastard, isn't it. Pheasant's shut scalini's shut. Zuma will be shut. Annabelle's is shut. What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? Thank god my sister's here to cook. Anyway, the food looks good. — yeah, it's a big question. She hums a tune Catherine: Is the emu around? Catherine: Any emus around that haven't run off? Burrell: He's evil, isn't he? — he wants to get the dogs. Burrell: Why would you have that? I'd barbeque it. Catherine laughs Catherine: So rude. Come on! Burrell: The original one was nice, though. So, nice, I know. Do you know, we shouldn't have had two should have just stuck to the one. Frankie: I can chase her—... Catherine: She doesn't want to be chased! She does! — Catherine: She d—— oh! You're not gonna help get her over here by chasing her. — ok. Come on! Those emus are terrifying. I can't go near. I know they hate me and they want to peck me to death. — oh, no! She chuckles Frankie: What I'm gonna be like in a month's time I don't know, or maybe two weeks' time. You know, we'll like, go nuts. We don't know the end of it. I mean, I can cope with two months but if it becomes three, five or six months, I mean... That's quite scary, isn't it? Reporter: Italian jockey, lanfranco dettori is being tipped for a bright future forty wins as an apprentice is enough to persuade Luca cumani to put his faith in him. The 18—year—old is taking over from ray Cochrane at cumani's newmarket stable. Uh, it was a very big surprise, I mean... It's a very big task to replace ray Cochrane. He's a great jockey and I didn't expect to get the job so soon in my career. Cumani: Then he started winning races straight away and we never looked back. Commentator: First, number 10, "shamshir" trained by Luca cumani, ridden by Frankie dettori. "Charmer" goes away to give Frankie dettori a double. Reporter: Frankie dettori is probably the best young jockey in eur0pe at the moment. Frankie: Starting the parade, I felt a little bit... My heart going, in a way. You know, because I realised how much that meant for everybody. Frankie, vo: A few races, they are printed in my mind I guess for life was my first group one on ”mark of distinction ” at ascot and / remember crossing the line. It was my first experience of a big race and eve/ything went dark. You just get this sensation of floating off .. Of time slowing down. It feels like you 're not in this world like eve/ybody stops and like you're the only one moving. It's very hard to explain, it sounds a bit weird. Cumani: He's made a remarkable success in such a short time but there's no doubt that with experience, uh... He will learn more and more... And one just hopes that he carries on getting to the top of the tree and staying there for many, many years to come. When I get back to newmarket, I'm going to get changed put my jeans on... he laughs open the fridge and I know I've got a nice bottle of champagne waiting for me. I'll have a little glass before I go out. I go see my friends have something to eat... And I don't know after that. After that, it's a surprise. He laughs I'll probably be arrested! Aeroplane engine roars I wasn't satisfied with just being a good jockey I wanted more. Maybe because I was a foreigner... Maybe because I was a young man with no guidance and I thought, "maybe there is something more up there" you know, then I wanted to see. I wanted to be famous. I wanted to be with the... The a—iisters. I wanted to go to their parties. Maybe I was intrigued. I wanted to see what it was like. I kind of used my job to propel me to that world. But maybe it was a good incentive because it made me ride good because I wanted to be famous. Burrell: He passed his driving test so of course, the first car he bought was this flash Mercedes. With a sort of spoiler on the back loudest stereo in town. Frankie: I used to go out a lot. No different to any 18—year—old boy. I was never close enough to become champion jockey because you need to put that work into it. I couldn't wait for the weekend to come so I could go out and party. Basically, racing became a secondary job. I kind of got this fee! Of excitement because I was getting recognised. Do you know? I felt great. I could go anywhere. I would say that too much money and success came too quick and too easily and it just all got to my head. Burrell: At that point Frankie made this extraordinary move. He went to have a short stint in Hong Kong. In those days it was quite commonplace for the jockeys here to go out there for a month or so in the winter Cochrane: He loved the lifestyle of Hong Kong he lived next to the racecourse... Walk across, ride a horse, come back, go back to bed out all day partying, fiddling about... Playing golf, do whatever you want get well paid, jockey's paradise. Jockey's paradise. Burrell: And he rang and he said, "it's fantastic out here I think I'm going to stay". And I said, "oh, that's great". I said, "what about Luca?" "Oh, well, well, I'm gonna tell him." I thought, "good luck with that!" All of a sudden, Frankie appears back in newmarket and pretty bluntly, he said to me... "I'm gonna ride in Hong Kong next year". I started trying to talk him out of it. I said "look, Frankie, this is a bad idea." It was all jockeys that were sort of beginning to be on the way down in england, they were going to Hong Kong to just make the last buck before they retired. I said, "it's not for you, it's not what you should be doing at this stage of your career. Frankie: I arrived back with my new shiny suit my new shoes and my gold watch. He looked at me and I thought "Luca, Luca, he's gone". We to—and—fro'd and in the end he said "you won't change my mind, I'm going" and then I lost my cool. I said, "this is the stupidest thing anybody could do I didn't expect this from you. What we've done together, what your future and our future is together and if you're determined to do that I will never speak to you again... And uh, he walked out and that was it. Frankie: I wasn't happy there anymore. I don't know why, perhaps, um... Because Luca was looking at me like I was still a little boy, I don't know. Cumani: He was still young. He hadn't had it that easy in his life he lived without a mother and his father was hard on him. I probably wasn't a very easy surrogate father to him because I wanted the best for him so I kept the pressure on him. Frankie: He was devastated. And you know, I thought, you know he used to look at me as though, "look at this idiot! What is he doing? He's wrecking his life". You know, and I was having none of it. That was Frankie's first great downfall. I mean, if you said, "where can it possibly go wrong?" It went wrong everywhere in every direction. I was with some friends. We drank a case of beer. I went to a nightclub... I bought some drugs from this guy... I came out of the club... The police stopped me, I got searched... I was taken to the police station because of a very, very small amount of drugs. I got away with a caution. At the time, I was riding some of the horses for the queen so that made this an even bigger story. So, that was reputation totally trashed. I was embarrassed because I kind of, I was the golden child, wasn't I? I lost the job in Hong Kong because of rumours and plus I lost the job with Luca because I told him I was going to Hong Kong. So all of a sudden, I was left with nothing. I mean, the world came to an end. At that moment in time, I feel low and down, you know... Because I'm not doing what I'm supposed to do. The best thing happens to me, I go to work in the mornings four times a week, gets me out of the house I ride some nice horses... I enjoy it, at least I get the chance to talk to other people I'd have a chat with John. I got it. John gosden: At least you can sit down and talk to a footballer and say, "look, we're not gonna play" but you've got these horses all ready to run races. They're psychologically in the zone to go and then you've got to back right away again, but these... These horses need to be exercised, they're racehorses. They're athletes, they're not just old gentle gliding horses. They're very different creatures. You know, they've got a great deal of nervous energy. Happy with him? — yeah, loved that. Loved that bit of rain, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Frankie: In my job, we do everything a million miles an hour... And then we come to a standstill. So then, it's very hard to channel your energy that you always have. You know, to do nothing. I do have good days and bad days. Like today, I had a bad day, I woke up I was lethargic... Negative. Catherine: Golly, yes. Too much time on his hands. That's lethal. Frankie: I feel I don't want to talk to anyone. You picked a good day, didn't you! He laughs Catherine: So, at the moment, he's down the gym. There's nothing else to do apart from watch television and annoy all of us. Frankie: You know, I think everybody's scared a bit... Tense, frustrated, we all shout at each other. No different to any other family. Catherine: And I don't think he even knows... Particularly that he's doing it but he wants that adrenaline, wants that buzz and just gets restless. Frankie: Yeah, but to me, it's been a mini reminder what am I gonna do when I... You know, when I retire? And now that I experienced this the last two months shit, I'm not gonna retire... He laughs not in the near future! Catherine: Yeah, it makes you think it is even more important, the time you have because of these things that are happening now. I think because, it's... It's all the... it's the running out of time thing, you know. You know, I can't do this forever don't know how long I can keep going the horses, physically and all of this so I think that just resonates in my head. You know, when I was 20, time was just not an issue everything was there forever. But I just don't... I think it must be an age 40 thing. It's a middle—age thing, isn't it? You hit 40 and you think, "golly, it's not forever". Nothing's forever, look how 20 years have gone. Just in a blink of an eye. Reporter: It's been quite a year for dettori who's still only 22. He had an application to ride in Hong Kong turned down soon after he'd been cautioned by police for possession of a small amount of cocaine. Burrell: The world of racing at that time would have reacted pretty badly. And a lot of people, when you're kind of flash high—flying personality, they quite enjoy seeing you come down that slippery pole and you come down it fast. My parents, they came over to give me support. When they went to the supermarket they were like, "that's the parents of that guy who'd been done for the drugs". Gianfranco in Italian: Gosden: Frankie was then a little bit in a situation where he'd burned his boats and that is when he first probably came into my life. And obviously, I'd seen him as a kid you know, I'd seen him ride but I hadn't sat down and had a conversation with him. So he came round and sat down. Frankie: John is a six foot six man very knowledgeable... He was quick, sharp, his eyes... I just noticed he's really intelligent. Frankie: He's very well spoken. He's very professional. You know, I used my uh... Mediterranean charm and so... We kind of hit it off, from the beginning. I think, when you saw him ride straight away you saw he was a natural. He becomes part of the horse. You take how the horse moves, its shoulder and everything he just seems to flow with the horse but if you consider the parentage his father, a champion jockey... And his mother from a great circus family he was bred to have athleticism and phenomenal sense of balance. The work ethic was there... And he was determined to put it right and I said, "well, I'll see what I can do". I'm gonna hold you like a son. Bloody don't! — Frankie laughs they'll think we're having an affair. Frankie: Funnily enough, it was that year, in 1993 that I first met Catherine Allen. She was just riding out as... A university summer holiday. I was so determined, you know, just to do my job that I didn't have time to look at girls... And then one day I was a little bit more relaxed and I saw her and I said, "oh, how long have you been here?" She said, "two months". I said, "I can't believe it!" Catherine: You know, "hello, darling haven't seen you before". She laughs interviewer: Was it love at first sight? Was it something like that? — no, not really. I'd like to say it was cos that would be really romantic, sorry... He was flat—out busy and he needed to put his head down and work hard. It was a very slow burn thing. Burrell: Fortunately, she agreed to go out with him. You know, god knows why. Frankie: She was 19, she wanted to go out. I said, "I can't go out, I've got a bad reputation". I've just been done for the drugs I cannot be seen in any clubs. So... I took a risk, I said "listen, why don't you go out with your friends" you know, and then I thought, "well, if she goes out with her friends, she might meet somebody else... But then luckily, she kept on coming back. That's, uh... lucky me. She had that natural look in her face and so nice, clever... I loved her straight away. Catherine's father could very easily have looked on in horror as this little Italian jockey came towards his house but I think they were all very accepting of Frankie and that was very nice. Frankie: Once we had the meeting with John I listened to my dad's advice that it is very important for a jockey to start the season at your minimum weight. So I decided to go to Morocco with him for two weeks. It was a little bit like going to prison. All I did was just walk the beach for about three or four miles every day and just my dad grilled me a fish every night. In ten days I lost a stone. Gosden: So when the doorbell rang on January 1st I opened the front door and there was this guy I'd never seen before. Shaven—headed, I thought... "He's sent his cousin, to make an excuse!" But it was Frankie, and he was determined to ride the all—weather and he rode the whole of January, February and march and by the time the season began at the end of march he'd already clocked 50 wins. Frankie: I knew at this time that I had something to prove to myself something I had to prove to all my friends and my parents. So, I wanted the championship that much that I didn't let any chances slip. So I gave, not 100%, I gave more than 100%. Cumani: Jockeys are under an immense amount of pressure. Probably more pressure on a jockey than there is on any other sportsman in the world because not only do they have to perform day after day after day they have a very hard life. They're up at 5:00 in the morning they don't go to bed until midnight at times. Cochrane: The jockey's life is going out riding maybe ten horses, four or five days a week and then training, sweating getting in the car, driving an average five hours a day five to seven days a week and then your life is just travelling. Frankie: You wanna keep going throughout the season and feel fresh, fly. We move around like this especially in the summer when we do the two meetings. Catherine: They eat, sleep, dream it always thinking about the next race "where will that go? Think I'll be able to get on that ride?" And all those things. All consuming, 24/7. Cumani: And at the same time they have to watch their weight all the time. They're not supposed to eat. They're not supposed to drink. Cochrane: You're living on a constant diet. Got to organise everything personally, yourself. What you're gonna eat, what you're not gonna eat. What you're gonna drink, where you gonna go... Where you're not gonna go. You know, I tried to take laxatives or try pee pills... Sweating, everything. Cochrane: Whole life revolves around the one thing making the weight on the scales every day maybe seven days a week for ten or 11 months of the year to be able to put out a good performance. If you can't do the weight there's always someone else who can. Indistinct commentary commentator: "Balanchine" is the winner! "Wind in her hair", second. "Hawajiss" third. Ridden by Frankie dettori... — hey! Who's first English classic it is and by gum, the smile is very much from ear to ear. Frankie: I was riding seven days out of seven I mean, it was non—stop, relentless. Commentator: And ridden by the champion jockey elect Frankie dettori, his 222nd winner of the season. Catherine: I was obviously smitten and so I'd ring up and wait for him to call me all the way back from racing and he'd just say, "I'm tired, I'm going to bed". So, you know every night I'd be thinking "we might go out tonight, might be able to have a meal tonight". "Tired, I'm going to bed." Look, I was tunnel vision because I was concentrating on getting my... My racing back on track, so um... You carry on with the studies and just let me focus on this. Look, we'll meet at the weekends but just don't bother me, you know. I was very harsh on her. Catherine: And I think obviously his father had got to him said "you shouldn't be doing that, son", you know. You'll look like you're going out and having a good time when you shouldn't be. Gianfranco in Italian: Frankie: They were living in my house. You know, I was never away from it... You know, if I got three winners "oh, you should have won in the fourth one. You messed up on this..." Relentless, every day, every day, every day. Gianfranco in Italian: Frankie: I felt like I went back to when I was in the shell as a kid. Yeah, it was a horrible feeling. I realised he was playing a mind game with me. To make me better. But his mind game wasn't making me happy. It was making him happy, but not me. I was tortured inside. Catherine: I only met 'em a couple of times but they were very strict. If I had a cold, I wasn't allowed to stay over. First part of my career was doing it for him. It was, I was trying to please him and he was never happy. I was doing something great and I hated it. Was just doing it just for him and eventually... pfff! You flip. Dad's record for one year was 229 wins only when I passed his total record and I thought "that's it" and I got 231 I went to house, "that's it, I'm not riding anymore". I said, "I've had enough. Enough's enough. What do you want from me? What do you want? I mean... How much do you want, just tell me!" He said, "you drive me crazy, you're never happy. Now beat your own record!" Basically, I told him to leave. I said, "listen, I can't take it anymore" and that was it. Gianfranco in Italian It was the... The termination time that, you know, I had to live my own life. Grater whirs Christine de'iti'ori in Italian: Gianfranco: Christine: Christine: Christine: Frankie: I arrived at ascot... Not a Scooby doo what was going to change my life. You know, it's a big day. You know, I'm getting pumped up and nervous. As far as I was concerned I wanted to win the big race. It was the queen Elizabeth. First race comes along, horse called "wall street". Commentator: And they're running. And "wall street" one of the first to show well, I got to the front. I never see another horse. Commentator: "Wall street" with Frankie dettori gonna win the opener. Great. Started the day really well. Commentator: A great start to the afternoon for Frankie dettori... Race two, it's a sprint race. I've got an outside chance. Commentator: And they're away. There's a big field and it was like a chess game, things fell into place. One moved, I got this gap. He couldn't get through. Commentator: Here comes "diffident". It's "leap for joy" —... I'm lucky, I fell in and I won by this much. Commentator: Ooh, it's a photo between "diffident" and "lucayan prince" Frankie: I was happy again but now I'm concentrating on race three that's the queen Elizabeth. Music: "Chorus of the Hebrew slaves" from nabucco by verdi it looks like on paper, it will be a two—horse race with this great filly called "bosra sham" and my horse called "Mark of esteem". I managed to stoke the good filly all the way and then the last 200 I pulled him out and he just flew. Commentator: And it's "bosra sham" the filly who's taken it up but "Mark of esteem" sprints and "Mark of esteem" and Frankie dettori. He completes a fantastic treble! Frankie: And I crossed the line, I punched the air and I was saluting at the crowd. Crowd cheers and I'm on cloud nine at the moment, right. I've still got four races to go. Commentator: There's running up money on Frankie because if Frankie rides four or five winners today the bookmakers will be devastated. Frankie: So, quick turnaround, get changed, race four... Commentator: And they're away. I thought I had the worst of the draws. I thought, to come across you know, I'm gonna lose too much ground, I don't think it's gonna happen. For an unknown reason, they all went too fast they all died in front of me and I just passed them at the end. Commentator: And now coming down fast is "decorated hero" under Frankie dettori, over on the far side and "decorated hero" has come on now to take it on "decorated hero" sprints away! Well, what an afternoon... For Frankie dettori. Frankie: And I could feel I could feel a bit of momentum gathering I could feel, like the atmosphere was changing, right... And then I ride race five... Commentator: "Fatefully" and Frankie dettori bidding for this fantastic five—timer and he look as if he's just gonna do it. "Fatefully" just holds! Audience applauds burrell: And I remember someone ringing me to that he'd won five races, so I went into newmarket to the betting shop to watch the sixth. Someone said, "oh, the BBC are going to delay the news". And I could tell this is something... Something not quite right, it was out of control I didn't know what was going on. I had a quick panic. It came to me that in 350 years of horse racing only sir Gordon Richard, Alex Russell and Willie castle won six in a row in a day. I'm one away! Commentator: And "lochangel" got away on the far side, quickening up now and "lochangel" bidding for the Frankie dettori six—timer is in the lead. "Lochangel" from "corsini". As they run up to the line "corsini" is putting in a last effort but "lochangel" hangs on for the six—timer. "Corsini" is second. So a fantastic six—timer for Frankie dettori. Crowd applauds and cheers so we had six, imagine, punched the air and I came back here everybody's there clapping me. And I was having the time of my life. "Great! I equalled the record, I achieved something that you're really proud of". Don't touch me cos I'm red hot! He laughs one thing's for sure, I'm definitely gonna do the lottery tonight, I'm that lucky today! But there is also race seven, right? And I looked at the horse's odds in the morning, it was 16 to one and the horse didn't win for a year, it was out of form and I thought, "I'm not going to let this race spoil the day". If this horse wins or loses, I really don't care I've achieved something amazing. And the start of race seven was right in front of the grandstand and I got a standing ovation. I was waving at... I was really milking it... And I was trying to enjoy the whole moment. Commentator: Two miles to go this time. Frankie dettori on the right of the picture on the wide outside, he was drawn one here and he's up with the leaders too. Frankie: And then the race itself, "fujiyama crest" he was a front runner so I managed to get him to the front... Commentator: "Fujiyama crest" just the leader from "meant to be", a roar goes up from the crowd as Frankie leads them out ahead of "meant to be" and on the inside, pat eddery is on "northern fleet". So, I come into the straight and... Wow, you could hear the roar. Commentator: Two furlongs out another roar from the crowd. Frankie dettori's out in front "northern fleet" is in pursuit. He was getting tired and I was slowing down and could hear the others coming. The winning post was like oasis away it wasn't getting any closer. Commentator: "Fujiyama crest" and Frankie dettori... It's a desperate finish as they run up to the line! "Fujiyama crest" finding a bit more and it's seven for Frankie! "Fujiyama crest" holds on. Crowd cheers Crowd applauds and cheers I came back here and you imagine a sea of people... Everywhere, they were on lamp posts. They were on railings. I was still in shock. I was still in shock from race three never mind I won seven in a row! They cheer So, emotionally, I couldn't handle it. I think the adrenaline, the crowd... They just lifted me and got me there. Perhaps I should have enjoyed it a bit more. It happened in a flash. Man: Ready? Yeah, five seconds. Indistinct chati'er Frankie, it's a day that many, many people are always gonna remember. A 25,000 to one seven—timer. The bookmakers genuinely can't pay out. It's just been an amazing day. How could you believe that this could happen? I can't believe it, after the second... Thank the lord, too. Give me this gift and just... Give me the pleasure to enjoy such a great sport. Cochrane: After the racing was over I had a felt—tipped pen and I made the note and put the date up "Frankie dettori sat here amongst mere mortal jockeys and won all the races. He laughs Frankie: Ray did that! I had to cancel this bit off, it was "wanker" you know? — they laugh anyway, woke up in the morning, I felt like king Kong. I opened the door... I had my t—shirt and my underpants to get the papers outside my front door... There was about three tiers of paperazzi two TV cameras... I shut the door with the papers I rang Pete, my manager said, "Pete, they're camping outside my house". And basically, the poop hit the fan about... Life in general. Quite simply the best jockey in the world today, Frankie dettori! Frankie: I was on every front page in every magazine and every newspaper. Frankie dettori. — I was doing morning TV chat shows, it was absolutely mad. Commentator: "Shantou" is getting there, at the post. "Shantou", "dushyantor" in second. Commentator 2: Bit of a character. There he goes! Frankie: Now, even people who knew nothing about racing became interested. It's Frankie dettori! Burrell: And he does have that showmanship. He enjoys it. The great thing for racing was that it had happened to him. He became a one—man marketing operation to the general public for horse racing in this country. Man: Frankie dettori. Gosden: I think it's a great thing to have happened. I don't think it propelled him to being any more full of himself than he already was! He laughs and I think when you ride at his level you walk in there with a little bit of a swagger. Commentator: Frankie dettori goes for his 1000th winner! It's "classic cliche", he's read the script racing up towards the line, 1000 in the locker classic cliche, Frankie dettori the winner. Whoo—hoo! Reporter: The man who made it to the record books at ascot last year, looked calm and relaxed as he arrived at newmarket's Roman catholic church. Woman yells: Frankie! Indistinct chati'er and laughter Catherine: When I got to the church there was all these people waiting outside. It's like, "what?". Again, another name? "I thought, that's so lovely, people are". We were excited cos his family were coming over. His mother is the super nicest loveliest, kindest, sweetest person in the world who doesn't worry about anything she just wants to love everybody... Everyone be happy and wishes everyone the best in life. And then you've got his father who's the other extreme. I think there was an issue at the wedding if I remember rightly. Luckily, it was all in Italian. I don't know... About which row they were in or who they were standing next to for once, again, Frankie did stand up to his father and say, "stop complaining". Frankie: My stepmother was kicking off. My dad was kicking off. I thought, "just leave me out of it. It's my day, and I want to enjoy it". Catherine: So I think they stropped off. Frankie: Oh, my dad is stubborn. He hasn't spoken to my sister in 40 years. My dad always throw things and say "I told you, you shouldn't be doing this... It should have been done there... You shouldn't have run away from da—da—da—da... And my sister, "no, I do what the hell I want", ia—ia—ia so... and nobody wants to get in and I tried to get them together, no chance. It's heart—breaking because I hate to see my sister not treated the same as me. So, because I was taking my sister's side we argued like cat and dogs. And there was a... I didn't speak to him for three years. It wasn't pretty. It wasn't pretty... And I'll be honest, that's it. Alessandra speaks Italian Alessandra in Italian: They kiss Frankie in Italian: Commentator: We 're getting ready for the first race fol/o wing resumption of racing. We 're all delighted to be watching this one o 'clock at newcastle in the company of our racecourse commentator Darren Owen. That's the start! We started! He laughs — Darren Owen: They're offl going over the straight mile ”my boy Lewis a little bit slow to go... Getting excited over a class six race probably the worst horses we got in england. Anyways... sorry... Dog toy soueaks so, it's good, yeah. I mean, look... Seventy—six days without racing is... Yeah. Too long. Interviewer: Been driving you nuts? Driving me nuts. Driving them nuts as well. No, it's good, like I said, I'm really, really excited. Yeah, feel like... A kid on Christmas day, you know? Catherine: I'm delighted. There's much more spring in his step. Buying the newspaper, much more purposeful. Yeah, yeah, yeah, all good. All good for now. Till the horses go and get beat, but yeah. Definitely less snappy when he's got things to think about. When he hasn't got things to think about he can get upset like a racing pigeon that happened to stop off in our garden, you know. I got the pigeon in the kitchen and I chucked a towel and I caught it, brilliant. There, put him in the box. A friend of a friend has got some racing pigeons so I thought I'd just send it to him. I went upstairs to get changed Ella told tallulah that I was going to kill it so she let the pigeon out of the box so I went absolutely berserk, it took me hours to catch it. It went back upstairs, shitting everywhere over the windowsills and everything, anyway... I was in the pool and it just went there for a drink and I got it. So I put it back in the box drove it down to newmarket. I give it to a friend of mine... And that's the story of the pigeon finished. I don't think he needs extra dramatics round him I think he probably creates quite a lot himself. Yeah, overreacts to everything. Girl: Guess what's outside! — the pigeon's uh... no! Fucking pigeon has come back! Girl: Why did it come back. — why are you feeding it? I'm really upset. I was happy the racing started, now I'm really upset. Come... come... It took me three days to catch him. Right, bye. You catch the pigeon. Do me a favour, do something! Burrell: Yeah, we're on a roll at this stage. He's unavoidable. He's riding fantastically. You know, he's broken records. He's fulfilled the expectations of his apprenticeship. Frankie: The stable of godolphin owned by sheikh Mohammed and his brothers was created in the early '90s. From being at John's, I was selected to be first jockey... Ciao/ and we had tremendous success from the start... And then the empire was so big the mares, the stallions they produced non—stop. Then what races I hadn't won for them? Burrell: The relevance of Dubai as it was coming up in the world at the same moment, they suited each other. They were building those huge towers on sheikh zayed road and the burj al arab hotel because if racing were to be the main sport to headline... The uae, then Frankie went hand in glove with that. Catherine: I know we always go on about the "good old days" but it just had this lovely special feel in Dubai. It was something new and exciting. I used to really enjoy it. It was lovely. Traditional music plays Frankie: You know, I had a great job I was riding good horses. I travelled the world all my life but even more so then, you know because we target a lot of international races. Commentator speaks foreign language Cochrane: Every Sunday, I think he rode something like 14 winners abroad. Group one winners abroad. It's unbelievable! Indistinct commentary commentator: Here we go in the Dubai world cup he's annihilating them! This is the wonder horse. "Dubai millennium" is coming home well clear. What a performance! "Dubai millennium" wins it. Catherine: Everything was new, everything was exciting. Look where... look where it's got us, you know look how well Frankie's done. He's got the top job. Uh, we're getting treated like kings and queens out in Dubai. Are you ready? They cheer a world away from sitting in newmarket for Frankie. He whoops and young and we've got everything in front of us you know, there's no panic about time. So, yeah, it was a golden era. Now we're in 2000, everything... Going absolutely hunky—dory, fantastic to go back to england... And that basically, 1st June 2000. Catherine: Leo's declined. Oh, I don't know, they're all being difficult. Just the three of us then. Frankie: Does it not look good? Cochrane: Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, it looks well, looks well. Hope this is cold. It is, it's been in the fridge. Frankie: For two months. I can't get the thing out. Well, who gave you that? Frankie: You sort it out! Frankie giggles hold that for now. I'll tell you what... — would you like—... Nobody's gonna run off with it! They laugh oh, my god. Who gave you this? For my birthday, somebody—— — oh, yeah, yeah. Are we two metres apart? Sorry. — excuse me! God, sorry! Next thing, we'll be all over the news and everything, so it will be! — they laugh yeah, but you're like part of the family, ray. Cochrane chuckles I know that. There you go. — well, toast... For a twenty alive and to health. — cheers. Good health. Poor Patrick... Yeah, poor Patrick, good lad. Good lad, sorely missed. Twenty years. She laughs — cor! That is good stuff. 1st June 2000, basically, I had to go to goodwood. At the time I had a pilot and I had a twin—engine cessna. From here to goodwood can take you three hours... It can take you five hours. I couldn't face the drive so I rung Frankie up I said, "Frankie, any chance I could have a lift down?" He said, "yeah, no problem". Frankie: And it was a horrible grey day. Windy and grey, it didn't have a good feel to it. Cochrane: The pilot, Patrick, lovely fellow... Had the plane all lined up. We were right at the back of the airfield and the wind just gusted from the left. Set off... Down the airfield, come out from behind the trees and the wind caught it. It flew away and then bounced. It was a massive impact. Ground out the suspension and the propeller caught the ground and then away it went again. And I just looked at Frankie and I went... Yanked up the seatbelt... And he looked at me and we didn't even scream. There was smoke coming out the engine and the engine's whining. And at that point, then I thought, "I'm dead". We'd just had a young boy, Leo who was our first son. You know that feeling of disappointment. A lot of people say, you see your life flash in front of you. No, I was just thinking "no! Why? Why now? Why take me now?" It was... there was a great big bank called "the devil's dyke". We're heading for the dyke and the wingtip caught the dyke. And went like that... And I just went, "this is gonna hurt!" I don't remember another thing. Plane engine whines — metal crunches Cochrane: And I woke up. After maybe... he sighs thirty seconds, or something like that there. Frankie: I thought I was dead. You know, I thought, "am I on the other side?" I could see the two engines on fire. I could see Patrick the pilot with his head on the dashboard. Then I could see everything but I couldn't focus on anything. Ray gave me a bang. He said, "get out, get out cos the plane is full of fuel!" Cochrane: You just know, you just... get out. Frankie: So, as I went to get out where the door was the door didn't... It was like, crushed. Cochrane: I kicked the luggage door open said, "come on Frankie, get out here". He was covered in blood, couldn't see nothing. So I put him out on the ground and I was climbing back in and he couldn't walk. He started screaming, his leg was broken. Frankie: Ray kicks me up the backside he drags me away, pfft... Twenty metres, I don't remember. I thought, "oh, I'll get him out the road and I'll get back in for Patrick". But this time the left—side engine was on fire of course the wind was making the flames... Blow and making it even worse. I opened the door and I was knocking the flames back with my coat to get Patrick out... But I mean, it's like a flamethrower coming at you. In any minute of that time the whole thing could have just blown up. Frankie: I remember ray really lost it. He was going absolutely mad and he was beating the ground and kicking himself, he was screaming. He felt helpless that he couldn't go and save the pilot. I'd say, no chance... Absolutely no chance of getting in there. Then boom, the whole plane exploded. Cochrane: You had to step back... And um... And that was it. Just nothing you could do. Frankie: Uh, Ray's... He's very deep, you know, we never talked about this. For the last 20 years it must be... Burning inside him... Seeing somebody die in front of your eyes. Cochrane: The reason I don't... Have never talked much about it is because you feel a little bit guilty that you're stood eight foot from someone and there's nothing you can do about it. Frankie: I haven't talked about this for a long time it's hard. I shouldn't be here, that's why. Cochrane: We were very lucky. We were very lucky. If I'd have been say, knocked out for two minutes... None of us would be here. Really happy to be here. Very much. I gotta thank him. But you know when somebody saves your life... You have to be grateful. That's it. To our poor Patrick. Yeah, poor Patrick, good lad, good lad sorely missed. Twenty years. And for you, it wasn't even... You'd been in a plane crash before Frankie's two. — two? Two. That was my third one. Oh, dear me. — and two near misses. We were very lucky really because I'd had all that. Cos you know... knew what to do. Frankie said he just laid there. — I had a fair idea what to do. But the thing was that... — I remember you did uh... The school... — yeah. There's the pigeon. It's there. The pigeon that's been stressing you out. Yeah, he'll be alright. He's driving me—— — he's looking fit, so he is. Cochrane: Fuckin' hope so! — I'm not sure 20 riding. Cochrane: I've got the pension for it. Catherine: We'd like to last 20 living. Yeah, you... yeah. Two of britain's top jockeys, Frankie dettori and ray Cochrane are being treated in a Cambridge hospital tonight after the plane they were travelling in crashed at newmarket racecourse. The pilot was killed—— — burrell: I drove straight to addenbrookes. I was there by about three o'clock in the afternoon. I walked straight past ray and Frankie and I think it was ray who said, "Pete..." And I looked at these two and I... I didn't recognise either of them. Frankie: And then I was looking at ray and he was burned to shreds and I said, "ray, you don't look too good, mate" and he said, "you don't look too good yourself!" I had to get my leg operated. I had to get plastic surgery on my face. They put me in a wheelchair, and then it was time to go home. You know, I stared death in the face for three seconds and... You know, obviously it wasn't my time. It obviously gives me a completely different approach to... To life. Inaudible Frankie: My dad came to see me. You know, we didn't talk to each other for years about pushing me too hard, about fighting with my sister... All that crap went out of the window. Look, I nearly died and we thought... What is the point of all this? What are we arguing for? And we made up. But it took that to make it up, believe it or not how crazy is that? Gosden: It hits everyone very hard and this idea, "I'm just rushing through life" and "I'm a superstar jockey" and flying here there and everywhere and round the world, it does... Something like that makes you stop and really think. Frankie: There's a lot of questions I couldn't answer you know, "why me? Why that young? Why am I not dead?" Burrell: Yeah, it changed his whole outlook on life. You know, they got on and they had their children. Got on with houses, got on with... Got on with everything. Frankie: In a way, I started to appreciate life. But you know, inside my soul really I was still a bit... Under shock and I'll be honest with you and many people told me, I wasn't the same for two years. Studio audience cheers oh, let's have a look. It's number eight! Frankie: I was doing lots of TV. I wasn't distracted, but I guess it's very hard to... Do one or the other, I was doing both. Reporter: The dettori empire is expanding. The latest edition, a restaurant in the centre of London. Catherine: Now we've got children it does... Scare me, you know what I mean, he falls off horses falls out of aeroplanes, you know, I can sort of... Do without that a bit, you know? Frankie: I didn't know if I wanted to be a jockey or a family man. I didn't know. Uh, and I was doing neither good. Commentator: Well back was Frankie on "snowridge" Frankie: And Catherine changed me a lot. I was always putting work before her and that changed you know, and then I was enjoying myself a bit more. I was not bothering about chasing titles. TV presenter: He's actually admitted, you know that another championship in britain which he's won twice before is an unlikely event. As a family man, I guess he's thinking about spending quality time with the children and Catherine. Gianfranco in Italian: Si, what are you going to do with your ingredients? Well, I'm very disappointed there's no pasta there. Gianfranco in Italian: Perhaps I took my eye off the ball and perhaps... I said, "whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't want to get recognised because I'm doing chat shows and quizzes. I want to be remembered as one of the greatest in my sport... I thought, "no, I've got to stop all this". Stop all this. And I had this ambition to be champion again because I had to prove it to myself one more time that I could do it. I got my head down and I went for it. Day in, day out, back to like in the early '90s when my father used to whip me to go to the races. To become champion, now I was doing it in my own terms. Commentator: 192 winners for Frankie dettori. Franke dettori's giving the sport a much needed boost. The highest profile, the most charismatic most popular jockey is ending the season as champion. It's as though the sport has challenged him to show them that he can still get down and graft if he has to that he is not just a man for the big occasion. It's not just about the fast cars and the international travel this is what he's brilliant at day in day out riding horses better than everybody else. Gianfranco in Italian: Frankie: The epsom derby is the best race. It is the pinnacle and my dad never won the derby so maybe it was an incentive for me to win it. The watch would come out of the safe and he would dangle it in front of my eyes. "See, son! See, look at that, look at that, look!" He said, "one day, if you win the epson derby you can have it". Little things like that, they inspire you. Drive you. If there was something that you haven't achieved yet that you'd like to achieve, what is that? I'd love to win the English derby it's probably the biggest race in Europe and I think, once I win that, I've done the full set. Look who I've bumped into, mr dettori! Huh! Has he given you, you know, any riding instructions? Or is it... any hints? — well, he did, yeah. We had a good chat. TV presenter in Italian: Gianfranco in Italian: Commentator: That's it, they're racing. Gianfranco in Italian: Commentator: By "soldier of fortune"... Frankie: For my dad, it's a big deal. He was riding with me, basically. I.. I was like a piece of him. Commentator: "Soldier of fortune", "lucarno" giving chase but it's all "authorized" and Frankie dettori at the 15th attempt lays to rest his derby ghost as up to the line "authorized" wins at a canter by five or six lengths. Gianfranco in Italian: Crowd cheers commentator: Well, he's probably too tired to uh, make it to the second floor. There he is with his father, gianfranco himself, an outstanding jockey. In Italy, one of the great riders but his status... Nowhere near approaching that of his son. Frankie: You know, dads are dads you know even if things are wrong I've gotta accept it, you know. I can't... Live all my life, you know, arguing with him, you know. I can't do that anymore, so... You know, time heals everything, I've moved on now. Phone chimes sue lawley: So, you've got five children now, Frankie two sons, three daughters, um... Any of them going to be jockeys? Frankie laughs Frankie: I don't know. I don't know, I mean all the girls like—... Sue: Would you like them to? — If they want to do it I will encourage it. Burrell: That's lovely. Thank you very much that was lovely. Catherine: You're welcome. Ella: People always assume that... We would all be sort of pushed into racing. I didn't really take much of an interest. Obviously we watched it as children, but not... I didn't really know what was going on. I just thought, "dad rides horses" kind of thing. But once first lockdown had worn off and everyone got sick of each other, dad was like "why don't you try riding out?" — I was like, "ok". Frankie: Look, the big moment is tomorrow I'm riding with Ella. This is like a historic moment when dad and daughter ride in the gallop. Well, it's only because I taught her to ride so beautifully that she has the confidence to ride racehorses. Burrell: At least it's one of your children wants to ride a horse! I'm going to choose him a slow horse. Guests chuckle Catherine: They will be lucky. He's not going to follow the rules. You're gonna wave at me. — listen! They talk over each other listen, once we done all those gallops it's everyone for themselves, you know. Burrell: Shall I tell you what? Any chance I can have a bet with chief? It'll be alright. — they laugh burrell: 4:5 Ella, 5:4 Frankie. Oh! Hey! — burrell: That'll do nicely. Ella: I did feel a bit like... "Oh, am I gonna like, look worse compared to them?" I don't know, it's meant to be like, in my genes. I don't want to let it down, I guess. Man: So this is Frankie. Frankie far side, Ella in the middle... And Hailey nearest us. I pulled up and I was like, "that was amazing!" She chuckles the more I get older and learn who I am the more I sort of realise that we are quite similar. You just turn into your parents, don't you? Interviewer: What do you think you'll be like as a coach? Hopefully, not as strict as my dad... But you know, uh... I will help as much as I can you know, that's what fathers do. Gianfranco in Italian: Frankie's stepmother: Gianfranco: Cochrane: Godolphin was Frankie's world. Just, that was his world he idolised those blue colours and he loved riding in those blue colours. Gosden: And then when godolphin expanded there was a little change of personnel. A trainer came in that Frankie did not gel with. He wasn't really interested in Frankie's opinion and it inevitably led to a couple of rows. This trainer, he wanted his own new kid on the block. Commentator: Mickael barzalona, trademark salute. Said bin suroor and Frankie dettori have rewritten the record books for years but maybe mahmood ai zarooni and mickael barzalona are the first inkling that we could be talking about a new duo that are going to dominate... Cumani: Frankie thrives on being number one and the moment he feels he's not considered to be number one his confidence level comes down. Uh, Frankie dettori is a great jockey but we have horses running right and left, so therefore we need more than one jockey. Frankie: Slowly but surely, I was not riding all the horses. I was riding some and I thought, "this is not right". Frankie's then thinking, "well, I'm going to ride on one horse he'll ride the other horse". But you know, if you get beat on that one or the other one wins is it going to be, "oh, he's not as good as he was" or "oh, he's getting older", you know? Commentator: The red cap then, of Frankie dettori on "prince bishop" Frankie: It was an insult to me because I didn't deserve it and it was not explained to me. Anxiety, depression, he was unsure of himself. We saw the darkness that he never had and his weight was really bad, you know. Frankie: You feel ashamed, you feel scared. You got heart palpitations, you got anxiety... Catherine: The way he came back... So hungry and so depressed and then he'd just eat too much and it's got to go in the toilet. He was making himself sick, I knew it was happening. Because if you can't do the weight the next day you can be taken off the horse. Bulimia, yeah. Eat too much and had to throw it up. Frankie: The thing is nobody should be ashamed because you know, I'm not the only one. But, yeah, I went through a period that I did and really badly, to the point where I was doing it every day maybe two or three times a day. You can say it's probably self—harming or something or maybe something that triggers in your brain. It's a mental thing, I think, being bulimic. You're not happy with yourself. Really frightening time, the worst time, I'd say. Frankie: But in my professional world I just kept my mouth shut until one moment, then you have to make a decision. It was a big race in england called the st leger and we had a runner and I was not put on the horse. And I was stuck without a ride, so I had to ride for John gosden in the same race. Commentator: Franke dettori and John gosden both with five successes in this race previously. I had to race against my own stable. How weird is that? Commentator: In fifth is "inca", on the inside mickael barzalona and Frankie dettori on "Michelangelo"... Furthermore, the godolphin horse goes and wins. Commentator: "Encke" for mickael barzalona and mahmood al zarooni won the leger. Frankie: I said to myself "look, I'm 42 years old. I'm not having it!" I thought, "well, I've still got a lot more to give". You know, I'd rather end up with nothing than not give it a go... Than just sit there and just... Being kicked in the balls everyday. No. I wasn't ready for it. So that was it, that was the... tsh! That was the divorce. However... At the same moment came another dip. The jockey, Frankie dettori is facing a horseracing enquiry in Paris today, after failing a drugs test while riding in France in September. Reporter: Now he could face a lengthy suspension for racing's brightest star, these are dark times. Frankie: My job was going tits—up I was low and frustrated and angry... And I did fall into the trap of depression and I took some cocaine. You've got the weight and thinking "godolphin are definitely going to be getting rid of me". He knows he shouldn't have done that. A classic self—destruct. Frankie: The paparazzi outside your house... I felt embarrassed for my kids. They were going to school. They were getting slated. I was suspended for six months. Jon snow: We are in the midst of racing's horrifying perfect storm. The most brilliant jockey embroiled in drugs. But from the ashes of the sport's reputation comes the man, Frankie dettori. His fall was absent his resurrection still uncertain... Gianfranco in Italian: Frankie: You've no job. I've still got five kids. You know, I'm not working for six months I need to make some money, so what do you do? Housemaids behold! I'm now your glorious and supreme leader. They laugh the big brother house—... Cumani: It would have raised quite a few eyebrows and a lot of turning your eyes up to the sky... He laughs ...In racing. It was a pretty risky thing to do but they wanted a star on the show and... They paid for it. Long live the great Frankie dettori! They laugh and cheer — hand bashes podium things happen in my life then you sometimes do things you don't want to do, you know, I always said I'd never do big brother, but you know what? When I needed the money and I was on my backside, I had to do it! You know. Commentator: He has been a silly boy and hopefully this will sort him out and he'll be backjust before the derby and royal ascot next year and he should be back, I hope, better than ever. When I thought, great, you know, I'm back. You know, it's gonna be easy peasy, back to what I was. Boom! Silent. Nobody would phone. I couldn't even get a ride. No rides, nobody... Nobody. Frankie: You know, people that I thought they were my friends they won't talk to me, drop me. Drop me like a hot potato, boom! Catherine: It was just shocking that all the thousands of winners he had ridden and it's like people wouldn't touch him. Burrell: Every big organisation had perfectly decent riders. Was he going to go back round pontefract and redcar? Not really, and that's when it was really bleak. Commentator: Down towards the last furlong and a half Frankie on "wild desert", can he get this winner? He's being challenged on all sides... Frankie: I finished a year with I think about 16 winners, or something. How embarrassing! I remember people going round saying "oh, Frankie's had it now". "He doesn't ride as well as he used to". It's all part of Frankie's psyche, you know if he's not doing well, he does worse. Frankie: Your confidence is shattered. I could see my arms doing things... My brain wanted to go there, but my arms were doing that. Commentator: They're off and they're racing in the betvictor. Com handicap. There's Frankie towards the rear. Forty—six rides without a win. I think he'd dearly love to win this 4:45 here at sunny wolverhampton. Frankie: I went 51 races without a win. So out of confidence. It was like living in your own nightmare. He was irrelevant to the sport. You're looking at yesterday's man, aren't you? You know... Tomorrow's washing up. Frankie: And this went on for a while. I don't really remember. It was dark days. It was dark. And now at 44, I'm thinking, you know, I have to kind of prepare myself, cos if this carries on... Maybe I have to start thinking of retiring. Start another life, you know. Catherine: That was the lowest point that I'd... Ever seen him in, or experienced with him. Burrell: We were basically gonna stop. That was it. Frankie: It didn't look like there was a way out. Catherine was worried, she was, you know really concerned for me and for the family and uh, she burst into tears and she freaked out. She started shouting at me, "you know... All your life, you're telling me that you're good now that we need you, show me how good you are! Show me how good you are. You've told me all your life you're good, now... He sighs now that we need you, show me how good you are!" Strong words. You know, "show me how good you are..." I did genuinely mean it to stoke him up and say... and just put a rocket up his backside. To hear that from your wife... He sighs heavy salad, let me tell you. Catherine: I know perfectly well, you're good but you told me you were good and now you're doubting yourself and this is what's happening. It's not getting any of us anywhere. Well, that was the red rag to the bull. Frankie: That really hurt me. Really hurt me inside. I thought, "right! I'll show you". Gosden: There's no doubt that there was a bit of a... A gradual slide and decline and that was sort of looking like a nearly career—ending moment for him. But being Frankie, you know... There's just too much talent there. There's just too much ability and there's too much desire and love of race riding. I started in spring again. I couldn't get going. Every door I knock is shut. I come to royal ascot... And then the manager of sheikh joaan from Qatar came to see me. Anyway, so I took the job. I had nothing, so I took the job. I was spending more time in France than in england because most of the horses were in France so I was in and out twice a week. Reporter: Be—bonjour Frankie: Bonjour. — c'etait une course UN peu... UN peu bizarre, non? Oui, on y va... Doucement .. Vite, doucement gosden: He then did get a nice contract not with a whole load of horses but with enough horses in england to keep him busy and get him going. Well, it was nice to be wanted again and I started doing well again... And I was winning races again, I've got my confidence back. Reporter: You've had the godolphin split which seemed to be like a marriage break—up. Now you've got this real new job to look forward to. Frankie: It's given me a new lease of life, I guess, and you know, I never know what today has got to offer, so it's fantastic. And then, just something very strange happened. It became in the end a sort of fortuitous path because I had a fabulous young jockey William buick, but then godolphin wanted another number one jockey. He was the obvious choice to go on, but of course, it's the old story... It created a vacancy. And a friend of mine texted me, said "did you hear the news?" I said, "what?" William buick has left John gosden and is going to godolphin. I thought, "this is strange!" So I said to Catherine, "did you see what uh... What they're saying?" William told me, he was next season going to be riding for godolphin. My wife said, "well, let's call Frankie". And I said, "should I ring John, see if he wants me back?" As a joke, right. And the minute I finished the sentence John rings me! Iihi, John." He went, iihi, mini". I said, "what are you doing next year?" He said, "I don't know". He said, "I've got a plan!" He laughs I said, "so what's the plan?" I said, "right, come to me on march 1st and don't discuss it with anybody. "But I'll have you back 1st march next year. I'll have you back". Absolute madness! My phone rings and it's Frankie. "Alright mate, how are you doing?" "Ok, grand, grand mate", "have you seen the news?" He said, "William buick's going to godolphin" so I just immediately said to him, "have you rung John?" He said, "no". I said, "you lazy, idle Italian toe—rag, you haven't rung him? What's the matter with you? Why did you not ring him?" III didn't need to... He rang me!" I went, "get in there!" He laughs I couldn't believe it and from then on I just knew from then, the spring was back in his step. I couldn't wait for the season to finish and start the year. The next year, you know. I was so excited. After two years being... You know, no one, I'm back and now, it's... Really overwhelming of warmth. It's amazing and um... I loved it. Gosden: Well, he's a great friend secondly, pound for pound the greatest jockey I've ever put on a horse and I've been lucky to put some wonderful jockeys... Just leg 'em up on a horse. Thirdly, for someone of that class to see them wander off into a twilight zone... It was just not palatable that that could happen. And I popped in 1st march like he said ba—ba! I'm back. Like I never left. Gosden: I said, "come to our stable", which he did right to work, get on the horses. Frankie: First horse he put me on I don't know if he was trying to make a good impression. He put me on "golden horn". I thought, "well, this horse is not too bad!" Cochrane: He rang up when he'd ridden him work. He said, "ray, we've got a horse here! John put me on a real nice horse". "Oh, that's good, mate." Commentator: And they're off. "Golden horn" and "festive fare" "desegno" is scampering after them... Me and John hit the year running we were winning everything. Commentator: "Peacock" is making a late run but "golden horn" is out in front and it's going to be Frankie dettori again. "Golden horn" wins the feilden. And then "golden horn" stepped in and off we went. And even John said, "ray, got his mojo back. He's away now". Music: "Jack" by Michael nyman Frankie: Whoever thought at 45 I'd get a chance to ride the favourite in the derby? Specially for John. Commentator: Moving forward, "storm the stars" along with "golden horn". That's it. They're off and racing. Racing in the investec derby, "storm the stars" is one of those to grasp the nettle early... As they climb through the first furlong or so... "Jack hobbs" breezing along going well in fifth place at this stage. Then behind "Giovanni canaletto" "golden horn" now being asked to improve on the inside of "success days" "hans holbein" not by so far now "epicuris" travelling up in the pink cap then "elm park" in third. "Jack hobbs" now being ridden, just hanging in slightly. "Golden horn" with a bit of work to do. Now "Jack hobbs" finding full stride, edges to the front the complexion changes as "golden horn" now begins to run at his stable companion. "Golden horn" and "Jack hobbs" and "golden horn" looks like putting it to bed and it is "golden horn" driven out remains unbeaten. "Golden horn" for the derby. Franke dettori punches the air. Frankie: When I knew I was winning my body, emotionally, went like jelly. I could not feel a thing. In all the thousands of races, it was the most emotional race I have won in my life. Crowd cheers and applauds crowd whoops announcer: And here he is! The man the crowd have always warmed to. Cheers and applause Frankie: Mentally it was so important because for many reasons, you know. The ups and downs that I had... And... And those words... He sniffs "show me how good you are!" I remember them. And they were powerful, you know... And there was my "here you go". We done it, so it was uh... It was an amazing moment. You know, I'm crying of happiness but it was uh... It was, pfft... It was a full circle, you know, it was a full circle and uh... Yeah, it was powerful. So that was that. Music: "Vltava" from ma I/last by bedrich smetna Commentator: Could be about to see something very special. "Stradivarius", ridden by Frankie dettori looking for a fourth gold cup. Only the second horse to do that in a 214—year history... Reporter: And with the incredible combination of Frankie dettori and John gosden let's make the most of it... Reporter 2: At the moment John gosden is the best trainer in the UK and Frankie dettori is the best jockey in the world. It's a real elite pairing. We've had a phenomenal run from 2015 right through to... The present. Champion horse, derbies, prix de I'arc de triomphes. Frankie: We've been drought of crowds for 18 months, so... It's nice to get the buzz back. You know, I could hear my name being shouted and feel at home. At this stage of my career, I need an incentive perhaps cos I'm spoilt. I need the big occasion, I need the crowd I need the fever. Commentator: There is "stradivarius" skipping down to post six a path he's trodden many times before and he looks incredibly happy with himself there the 4:5 favourite. Commentator 2: They're off. The race, then, for the gold cup two and a half miles is their trip. The mare "Princess Zoe", the grey... Christine in Italian: Gianfranco: — Christine: Commentator: "Serpentine", "stradivarius" only had two behind him into the home straight. Two furlongs to go—... She exclaims "subjectivist", Joe fanning has stolen the race. Coming into the home straight, "subjectivist" wins by a good distance. "Princess Zoe" in second, "Spanish mission" was next. Then "stradivarius". Christine: Phone rings Frankie in Italian: Alessandra in Italian: Alessandra in Italian: Christine: Frankie: You can hate or love your parents but it's your life, this is your parents. So you gotta look after them. You know, like me and my mum. My mum wouldn't know how many winners I rode or if I'd been champion or not.. She wouldn't have a clue she doesn't... Give two shits if I won ten races or one, she just... I'm still her son, you know what I mean? With my dad I have a different relationship but you know, he's nearly 80. You know, I know he's playing games with me I don't mind. I've nearly finished my career what am I, going to try to impress him? I won everything, I mean what does he want, so... So, but still, you know I think he's... He's set in his ways. You know, I don't think he means it but he still rings me, "you should have done this... You should have done that. Why did you do this?" But I think some things you can't change so now I take no notice of it. Indistinct chati'er gosden: You could take your career so far but he is at the top. He was just crowned world champion jockey yet again... I mean, I think two of last three years or something. Some achievement. What he's done here now, it's... Unbelievable. He laughs indistinct chati'er burrell: I don't think that anyone deserves the amount of luck that we've had. It's a lot of luck and a lot of fun. We've had an awful lot of fun. Indistinct chati'er Now, it's basically, try to look after myself and carry on as long as I can. You know, it's what I love. It's what I do. You know. The chapter's not finished hopefully. Let's hope we can make another film. I didn't even know I was doing it! I'm scared! I don't want to do it anymore! I don't like it! I don't want to do it anymore! Commentator: There's a few famous names along here. None more so than you see dettori I have to say I have seen Frankie dettori this morning who is an absolute bag of nerves and not for his own races, but for his daughter, Ella. Frankie: My career started here all those years ago. It's quite mad that... My daughter's first race is here. He chuckles Ella: Sometimes dad's being like "no, you're not, you're going to uni". It was sort of back and forth for a while. Then I did say, "I do want to do this". Everyone's sort of accepted that now. Just let it go. — one hold. One hold, like you've been doing in the morning... Yeah. — let him run in your hands. Ok. — right, and don't move until you pass the "two". — yeah. And then from the "two" you can start... Ella: I like that it's worked out like this so... Cos is doesn't feel forced. I've just found my own path, I guess. I think the more you push someone to do something the more the sort of pull back. Catherine: We had both had discussions about "don't live through the children" cos that's really annoying for them... And you've got to let them live their own lives and make their own decisions. Be part of their life and be there to support them. Frankie, I think, has learned from his father there was too much, you know. There was something that was over support. It was trying to control and you can't do that cos they're their own people, they're individuals. Alessandra in Italian: Indistinct cha'iti'er — hello. Frankie: Now, you know, I'm... I'm just a dad and I want my daughter to do well. Gianfranco in Italian: Christine: Ella: People have said I do ride slightly like my dad um, which is obviously a compliment. I've definitely got his stubbornness. I get told that a lot. Yeah, the dettori name. That's always going to be something but... I don't know, maybe it spurs me on a little bit... Makes me try harder, we'll see. Time will tell. Frankie: Who knows what the future holds? It'd be the third generation, you know. It'd be quite funny or quite bizarre me riding with my daughter, wouldn't it? Music: "Sky's the limit... Chasing sheep is best left to Shepherds" by Michael nyman Mobile phone rings hello? Gianfranco in Italian:
