One, two, Lisa wait! Good morning, Mom! - I want donuts. - Get real. Better move it, Kel. How are you going to take a history test on a stomach full of sugar, Shawn? Your brain won't work right. You're an addict. - My blouse ready, Mom? - Can't you wear your white one today? - Mom, we all decided on the phone. We're all going to wear pink, me, Jan, Cindy. - Okay, okay it was just a suggestion. How would you like to wear my earrings? - Really? - Sure. You can look in the mirror after breakfast, eat. Lisa, honey, come on! Lisa! And Shawn, put down that honey. - Buy me Peaches and Cream Barbie. Honey, you got a million dolls. - Please, pretty please. - Buy me, get me, give me, buy me, buy me, get me, give me, buy me. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, sweetie. Have fun at school. - Okay. And you get an A on that history test. - No sweat, Mom. BLT down. - Okay ladies, here we go. Bye, guys. - Alright, bye Annie, thanks. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm not too late for the usual, am I? - Well, for you. What's that? - Madonna concert tickets tomorrow night. My shift's over at six, I'll see you about seven? - I don't know. These are really expensive. - No, I won them from the radio. - Really? - Mmhmm. Can't you see the callous on my dialing finger? - I don't know, Danny. My kids and... Maybe you should ask another girl. - I just asked a girl, you. And you're not going to back out on me again, are you? - So Shawn goes sliding into second base and he's safe. He's so proud of himself. - Good for him. Annie, listen, um, you're probably going to think I'm crazy but can you maybe do a favor for me? - Sure. - Good. I can't deposit this until Monday and I'm going to be running around all day tomorrow and I don't want to carry it with me. Can you maybe hang onto it for me? - Danny, this is a fortune! - Yeah, I know, I know. I would leave it at home, but you know, I got that crazy roommate and there's always people there I don't know. Do you think I'm being paranoid? - Well, no, it's just you don't even know me that well, Danny. I mean, I could go off to Mexico or something. - Yeah, right. You're about the only person I can trust. - I don't know Cathy, I don't think I should go. - Why? I thought you kind of liked him, he's so cute. - Yeah, he's cute. But I already promised the kids I'd take them to the park tomorrow. - So, you'll be back in plenty of time. Ooh, here's the horoscopes. Check this out. Your lifestyle will undergo a major change the first week of the month. How'd they know I quit smoking? - What's mine say? This is perfect, listen. While doing for others don't forget to take time out for yourself this month. - It says that? - Yes, listen to your sister. You've hardly been out since your divorce. There's time to have a life, you know? He's not asking you to marry him. - I don't know, Danny. My battery's been acting up and I don't know if my car can go that far. I'd pick you up but I'm running a little behind myself. Can you drive on over here and just park your car in the garage and we'll take my van on over to the concert, okay? - Okay. Listen, I almost forgot. Can you bring my money? - I'd be happy to, I've been a nervous wreck since I've had this. - We're back! - I'm on the phone, just a minute. - Let's clear the table first. Right. Okay. Goodbye, be good, I love you. Goodbye, be good, I love you. Goodbye, be good, I love you. Thanks you guys and thanks for doing my makeup. You look great. - Bye Mom! - Don't do anything I wouldn't do. - Yeah, don't stay out too late! Alright and now for all you people who wanted to go to the Madonna concert and were unable to get tickets. Well wipe away those tears because we have a special three hour Madonna block. Police, freeze! - What? - Let me see your hands. All the way out of the car, please. Up against the car, come on. Spread your feet. - Danny, Danny what is this? I think my wire slipped. - Don't worry, we got the whole thing. Danny! - Quiet. - I think I got something. Here, check it out. Metric conversions and everything. - What did I do? What did I do? - You're under arrest. - This is a mistake. You have the right to remain silent. This is a mistake. Anything you say can and will be used against you. - This is a mistake! Thanks for bringing me the clothes. I didn't want the kids to see me like that. - What are you going to tell them? - Nothing. - Listen Annie, you don't want to take your chances with some legal aid guy. I'm going to call my buddy from work, the one whose brother's a lawyer. He handles lots of drug cases. - Okay. Mommy! - What happened? - Where've you been? - I'll handle this. Hey! You okay? - Yeah. - Mama! - Well, I went out this morning to surprise you guys with donuts for breakfast and the car broke down again. And I had to get towed and there was no phone around so. Some surprise? Have you guys eaten? No. - Well, why don't I make you some breakfast. - The people will prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Anne Gallagher aided and abetted Daniel Jenkins and that she was in possession of four ounces of cocaine with intention to traffic and sell. This was a business. Among the papers found in Anne Gallagher's purse that night along with the money, were calculations reducing pounds to ounces and from ounces further down to grams. Daniel Jenkins was a middle man. It was Anne Gallagher that was the drug dealer. Would you describe what took place on the night in question? - Very briefly, I arranged for Annie Gallagher to sell me four ounces of cocaine and for the buyer, Detective Straighorst, to come to my house. - What happened around eight o'clock? - Annie arrived in my driveway, she drove into my garage and I immediately shut the garage door down behind her from the house. - Now, could you describe what took place when you went into the garage? I went inside and Annie was still in her car. She began to get out the driver's side door and I came around and squatted down beside her. I asked her if she had the cocaine. And what did she say? She said yes and she produced a clear plastic bag with some white powder in it. Was there anyone else present at the time? - No, I left the garage, went into the house and that's when I was arrested and handcuffed. Did you say anything at that time? - Yeah, they asked me who was in the garage. I told them it was my dealer. - Thank you. No further questions Your Honor. - Is it not a fact that on the night of your arrest detectives indicated to you that you were being charged with criminal sale and possession in the first degree and that you could go to jail for a minimum of 15 years. Is that not correct? - I believe something to that effect was said, yes. - Unless you cooperated. - Well, it was like, if you help us we'll help you, something to that effect. - Now, as part of your so-called cooperation was one of the conditions that you must testify against Annie Gallagher at her trial? - Yes, my testifying is part of my cooperation. - No further questions. Thank you very much. Redirect? - Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Jenkins, have any promises or commitments been made to you in respect to your cooperation? - No, sir. - And what did you hope would be the result of your cooperation with the District Attorney's office and other law enforcement agencies? - I hoped to receive a sentence of lifetime probation from this court. - We agreed to leave my car there so I pulled into the garage and the doors closed behind me. And I started to get out of the car and Danny arrived and he said I have somebody coming over. And what else did he say to you? He said that he had people coming to the house that he didn't want me to meet and he said just sit tight and I'll be out in a few minutes. And I said alright and then he started to leave the garage. There are shelves that are directly left of the door. And I saw him there and then he left very quickly and that's the last I saw of him. And what happened then, Annie? And then the garage doors opened and there was a man with a gun and he was pointing it at my head. And the money that they found in your purse? - He had given me some money and I guess it had some papers attached to it and he wanted me to hold them for him because he didn't want his roommates to know that he had any money on him. Thank you, Miss Gallagher. - You testified that you don't use drugs, is that correct? - Yes, that's correct. - Have you ever used cocaine? - No, I have not. - Then your testimony is that you saw no cocaine on the night in question. - I had nothing to do with that, nothing. - I don't think you understand, counselor. Your client is charged with the sale of four or more ounces of cocaine. We're automatically talking three A1 felonies here. That's a minimum of 15 years. - You don't need to instruct me in the law. - Then explain to me how you can reject a generous plea bargain of one to three years. - Because I'm innocent! We've been telling you for months, I'm not guilty. - My offer still stands. - I don't get this. I don't get it! Danny Jenkins is the drug dealer. How come he's not on trial? And he's getting off an probation for testifying against me! - Annie, calm down, listen! Now do you understand what he's saying because we've been through this before. If the jury finds you guilty you will get a minimum of 15 years. - You don't think I should take the plea bargain? Marty what am I going to do with my kids if I go to jail? You think I should take the deal? - They've made a serious case against you. It all depends on whether the jury believes you or Danny. - Well I can't do it. I can't say I'm guilty when I'm innocent. But I don't want to stay home. Today's tryouts for the school play. - Honey, I tried to get a babysitter and I couldn't. Somebody's got to stay with Lisa. - Then why don't you take off work? You're always telling me to do good in school. So how come you're making me give up everything just because you got a new job? - That's enough! - It's not fair and you don't even care! - Honey, honey this is all going to be over soon. I mean, pretty soon I'll be able to take days off, but I can't right now. Believe me, I want to. Honey? Go away! - Kelly, honey I'll be back as soon as I can. - So, maybe there'll be a verdict today. - I hate lying to my kids, Cathy. I swore I'd never lie to my kids. Even with the divorce I told them the truth. - They're kids, how can they understand? I don't even understand. - Has the jury reached a verdict? We have, Your Honor. Will the defendant please rise and face the jury? Ms. Foreman, what is the verdict? - With regard to all three counts of criminal possession and sale of a controlled substance we find the defendant guilty. - Your Honor, I'm not a cocaine dealer. You're destroying my life. - I am not destroying your life. We have a legal system. Your attorney gave you very fine representation and the jury has rendered a verdict. - This is my life, I have three children. I swear to you I am not a cocaine dealer! - I have no choice. The defendant will be remanded to county jail pending sentencing next Tuesday 10 a.m. - Marty! Court is adjourned. - Cathy, Cathy! - Come on, let's go. - Please don't tell my children. Don't tell them! - But Annie, what am I going to tell them, Annie? - Just tell them I had to go away somewhere. We'll appeal, I'll get out soon! - Annie! Uncle Pat's real sick and your mom had to go down to Florida right away to help take care of him. - Who's Uncle Pat? - Well you remember, he was at my wedding. You know Aunt Rosa's husband, grandma's brother, he's real old. Remember? - But how come mom didn't wait to say goodbye or anything? - Well, she'd have missed her plane if she'd waited for you to get out of school. You know she had to get there right away. She'll be back as soon as she can. I better get to work. - I want my mommy, I want my mommy! - I know, honey. - Over there. White. Gallagher. Moreno. - Next. - Why do we have to do this? We'll be okay upstairs, I promise. I mean, Mom's coming back so what's the big deal? - As long as I'm responsible for you guys I want you under my roof where I can keep an eye on you. - End of the yellow line, come on, let's go. Come on, it's called walking, girls, let's move it. - Hey, hold it, don't advance til I tell you. Okay, move ahead, follow the yellow line. - Hey, don't move your butt, I'll get to you in a minute. - You better give me my letters, I ain't playing with you! - Hey, that's mine! I'm just checking, Perkins! - Okay, hand it back Willie before I give you... - No, you give me my letters first! - That letter's from my son, Willie, give it to me! - I wait every damn day and I don't get nothing? I'm expecting letters, too, important letters! And you, you minimum wage working bitch, you keeping them from me! - Watch your language. You just got yourself another charge sheet, lady, okay? - You don't scare me with your dumb ass charge sheets. I got rights, too... - Hey! Damn it! - Alright, fun's over, fun's over. That's assaulting an officer. - Assaulting a damn officer! I assault an officer all y'all are gonna know it. - Yeah, alright, you're doing solitary again. - Yeah, you're putting me in solitary, for the rest of my life, y'all just bring me my letters. One minute to lockup! Let's go. - What the hell you looking at? Get over here! - Pick it up! - Okay kids, now remember, quiet when you get up in the morning. Uncle Mike needs his sleep. Goodnight. - Aunt Cathy? - Yeah? - I think we left the nightlight upstairs. Come on, Lisa doesn't need a nightlight anymore. You're a big girl now? Sweet dreams. - It'll be okay, Lisa. Lights out! - Stupid old broad forgot to lock up the pantry. Look what I got! - Give 'em here! Pass them out before she gets here. - Thank you, Willie. Here you go. And you, you don't get nothing. 'Cause see, you ain't worked up no seniority yet. You want it? - Yeah, if you think you can spare it. - Well go ahead and take it. What's going on here? - Nothing, I, it was my fault, I'll clean it up. - You're not starting off on my good side. The rest of you can go now. - I'm watching you. Watching you. - Listen, I'm working on your appeal, but your conviction came with a mandatory sentence of 15 years to life so it's going to take time. I am trying to get you out, you hear me? I am trying to get you out. - When? - Look, it's not the kind of thing that happens overnight. First you've got to file the appeal and then it will take... - How long am I going to have to be here, Marty? Tell me! - I'm working as fast as I can. - What about my kids? What's going to happen to my kids? - Look, I know it's hard, but you've just gotta hang in there. - Hang in there? I'm not even supposed to be here. I never should have been convicted! There are women in here for murder who have shorter sentences than me. - It's not fair, I know. - You think Danny Jenkins has any kids, any responsibilities? He's the one that ought to be in prison and he's running around Scott free! I know honey, but Uncle Pat's still real sick and it's looks like I'm going to have to stay here a little longer than I thought. How's school, honey? I know, I know. But Uncle Pat's down here all by himself since Aunt Rose passed away and we're the only family he has. Okay. I miss you too, honey. Can you put Kelly on? Time's up. - Hello? Hello? I wasn't finished! - I'm sorry, I don't make the rules. - Mom? I think we got disconnected. What should I do, should I call her back? - No, no just hang up, she'll call back. Uncle Pat must have been waiting for an important call from the doctor or something. She'll call back later. - It's the last one, why don't you take it? - That's okay, you can have it. I usually have a soda anyways. - Why don't you take the milk? It's a lot better for the baby. I know, I have three kids. - Thanks, that's nice of you. - My name's Annie. - I seen you the day you came. My name's Yolanda, but everybody calls me Yoyo. Hey, these are the good ones. Gotta take them when they got 'em, in case you get hungry later. - Thanks. Sorry. Man, the Quaker lady, she's never in the cafeteria. She runs the children's center and helps us with our ninos. Comprende? - So Teresa, I need your help with Nicki, you're the only one that she'll listen to. That poor kid, she hardly even knows her mother. - So he just left, that was five years ago. No child support, no nothing. - My boyfriend came at me with a knife. I had to protect my baby. I told my lawyer and he says I gotta plead guilty for manslaughter unless I want to spend the rest of my life in jail. Now I think maybe I should have said self-defense. Because that's what it was and here I am in jail anyways. It's just for a little while longer until she gets out. - Until she gets out, that could be 15 years! - Will you keep it down, they might hear you! - Yeah, well they're gonna find out some time. - They're too young to understand. I promised Annie I wouldn't tell. - Yeah, well, I didn't promise. - Mike, Mike, please, honey. Listen, you heard what her lawyer said. He's going to get her out. She'll be out soon and then we can go back to being the way we were. Come on baby, you know I love you. - Hey, I was watching that! - Me, too! - Something happened to Mom, something bad. I don't think she's coming home. - Get out of here. - No, I mean it. Aunt Cathy and Uncle Mike are having a major fight about it. - No way. - Fine, Shawn. Your don't think it's a little weird that Mom suddenly flies down to Florida? I mean, without even telling us first? I mean, she leaves her job and everything. Does that sound like Mom to you? - Uncle Pat got sick again. She didn't get a chance to tell us. So what? What are you saying? Mom's a liar? - Mom wouldn't lie to us. She gets really mad if we ever lie. - Maybe Mom would lie if something really bad happened and she didn't want us to know. Because maybe we'd get too upset or something. Who are you calling? - Uncle Pat and then you can talk to Mom and find out what an idiot you are. - Fine! - Hi, Uncle Pat? This is Shawn Gallagher. How are you feeling? Really? That's great. Listen, could I... Shawn Gallagher, Annie's son. Annie. What? Isn't she with you? Shawn Gallagher. - Who are you talking to? - Uncle Pat. - Mom. - Mommy, Mommy! All visitors will remain at the table. Visitors must sit down at the table. - I don't get it. - He gave me some money to hold for him for a few days. And then when they found this money on me they thought I was selling drugs. - But, you weren't. Didn't he tell them? Didn't he tell them what happened? - No honey, he told them that I was his partner and that I was selling drugs, too. - But he lied! Didn't you tell them he was lying? - Yes, I did, I told them over and over. They didn't believe me. I'm sorry. I know this must be awful for you. And I'm sorry I didn't tell you the truth right away. I knew you'd be upset and I didn't think I'd have to go to jail. And then, I don't know I guess, then I just didn't know how to tell you. And I'm sorry I made Aunt Cathy and Uncle Mike lie, too. I promise you I'll never do that again. - Can you come home now, Mommy? - Not right away, honey, but my lawyer says real soon. - Excuse me, I don't mean to bother you, but I thought that you and the children might be more comfortable visiting in the children's center. It's a little easier. Annie, who was that woman? - It's Frances, they call her the Quaker lady. Without her there wouldn't be a children's center. Mommy, are we going to get our apartment back when you come home? - What do you mean, honey? We had to let the landlord rent your apartment. I mean, we can't afford both rents. - You let my apartment go? - Well, I was going to tell you, but I figured you had enough problems right now. - I can't believe you did that! You didn't even ask me if it was okay! - Well, what I'm not doing enough for you as it is? I take your kids into my house. You know, I ruin my life and now I've got to ask your permission every time I want to blow my nose! - Wait a minute! - Listen, Annie, I'm not the one who got you into this mess. Where the hell would you be without me and Mike to help you out? - I'm sorry, Cathy, it's just that it's really hard when I don't have any say in anything. You want to be in charge? Fine Annie, you're in charge. What's the plan, what are we supposed to do? - Cathy. - Listen Annie, things have changed. You know you're just going to have to let me figure things out by myself. - I'm afraid that visitor's hours are over for today. - Okay Mommy, let's go home now. God. - Honey, you've got to say goodbye to Mommy now. - No! I want you to come home now, Mommy, please. - I can't right now, honey. - I promise I'll be a good girl from now on, Mommy. Sweetheart, you're the best little girl in the world. You didn't do anything wrong. Please Mommy, please! - Come on, Lisa, come on sweetie, time to go. Come on, honey, come on, we'll see Mommy again soon. Kelly, Shawn, I know it's hard, it's time to say goodbye. - Come home now, Mommy please! - I love you, write to me. I love you, I'll call you. I love you. Dear Mom, Merry Christmas. Mom, we all hope to see you on Sunday. And do you know what I got for Christmas? I got a kite and a toy car. And also, have you been reading the Bible? - Excuse me. Annie, this is my new friend Tori. Would you read a book with her until her mom and grandma finish talking? - Sure. - Tori, come and sit right here, okay? And if you need me I'll be right over there. - Well, let's see, what kind of books do you like? How about this one? This one is my daughter's favorite. I bet I know this one almost by heart by now. Here we go. Once upon a time long, long ago in the deep, deep forest. - Next week we're going to have to really work on interaction. Brendan, Kristen, it's time, visiting hours are over. - Go say bye to your mom. - Come on, Brendan, hug mommy goodbye. You be a good girl, you hear? Go with your grandma now. See you soon. - Frances I don't know where these games and this puzzle go. - That's okay, I got it. - I really appreciate your help today. - You know, something must have happened. Maybe one of my kids got the flu. There's probably a lot of that going around at school. - I noticed the kids really seemed to like you. - You know, for a second there I almost forgot where I was. - How would you like to sign up to work in the children's center? We can use all the help we can get. I don't know. - It beats kitchen duty. - Well, I don't think I can. My attorney says that my appeal's going to be coming through and I'm going to be going home pretty soon. - Yeah, me too. - It's just, being around other people's kids, it's hard, you know. - If you change your mind just let me know. Good luck to you. - Thanks. - Yeah, well, it's a four hour drive round trip and the car's starting to act up. Mike's says we gotta get a new carburetor, it's going to cost a lot of money. - Sorry, Cathy. It's just I haven't seen them in a couple of weeks. - I know, I know, but today was my only day to do laundry. I'm doing laundry for five now, you know. - Yeah, I know, I know. So will you bring them next weekend? - I'll try. You know I gotta see what's what. I'm doing the best I can. Look, Annie I know they make you call collect, but Mike's going to divorce me if I get another phone bill like last month. You and the kids, you've gotta start writing letters more or something. - You know I'm going to pay you back every penny. - Look, let's not get into that now. You know, we already had to borrow money to pay the damn lawyer! Annie, I got something on the stove, I gotta go. Mike, what are you doing home? Shawn, what happened? - I was on my way out to work and I get a call from school. They're going to dock me two hours pay now. You're grounded, buddy, you understand me? You are grounded for a month. - A month? I told you, it wasn't even my fault! The other kid started it! - Are you okay? - Hey, hey, hey. What do you got to baby him for? If I say he's grounded, he's grounded. - I'm not babying him, he hurt himself. - He's grounded and that's the end of it. - Go to hell, you're not my father! Who do you think you're talking to you little punk? You're lucky you're not in some foster home someplace! - Mike let go of him! What's the matter with you? - Get off me! You know, I've had it with all of you. It's like it's not even my house anymore. - Mike. - I'm going to work where I can get some damn peace and quiet. - Don't leave! Honey, Mike! Please don't go, Mike come back here! There are you satisfied, you see what you've done? - I'm sorry, Aunt Cathy. - Just get out of here, go to your room, get out of my face! All of you just leave me alone! - Come on, Kel. What's the matter, you fall in? Go away! - Don't be such a hog! Other people need to use the bathroom once in a while! - Aunt Cathy? Aunt Cathy can I come in? What is it? - Aunt Cathy, can I talk to you? This isn't a good time, Kel. - Cathy? - What, what is it? - I think I got my period. I was wondering have you got any? Yeah, look under the sink in the bathroom, honey. I did. Okay, hand me my purse. Damn, I'm out. Here, I think the market's still open. Run out and pick up a box, okay? Go ahead, just get whatever's cheapest. And be careful crossing the street. Kelly? Would you bring back a quart of milk, too? - Outside of the can to get it open, there'll be this jelly stuff, it's real yucky, get rid of it. That's right, brown sugar and honey on the top of the ham. - He's kicking again. You want to feel? He's just dying to get out. - I know how he feels. - That's right, you put a clove inside each one of the little squares. - Now she done been on the phone more than five minutes. - How do you know? You ain't got no watch. - That's fine, you tell Eddie you can have a can of those pineapple rings. - Okay, your time's up. - 45 minutes at 325, I love you! - Hey, it's my turn! - Well I'm tired of waiting! - It's my turn! - Alright? - I've been in line longer than you, give me the phone! Give me the phone! - Who the hell you think you messing with? - I've got 15 to life for three A1 felonies. Who do you think you're messing with? - Well, excuse me. She got three A1 felonies, y'all. I guess I better watch my ass. - Yeah, collect from Annie Gallagher. Marty DeLuca. Don't tell me he's not at his desk! I've been calling every day for two weeks! Well, look, you just tell him I'm not going to take this run around. Do you hear me? You hear me! Fine. Marty, Marty what's happening with my appeal? We were supposed to hear on the 15th. What does that mean? I lost? My baby. I gotta go to the hospital. Please, help me! My baby's coming now, I've got to go to the hospital! Please! Quiet down there! One minute to lockup. - Yoyo, yoyo, what's the matter, are you okay? - Please, Annie, the baby's coming. - Her baby's coming! She's supposed to be sent to the hospital! - Get out of there Gallagher, you ain't no baby doctor. - Just give me a hand here. Now, now Fernandez, your baby ain't coming yet. - Yes, it is, I know it. My baby's coming, I've got to go to the hospital now! - You ain't going nowhere. Your baby ain't due for another two weeks. I've got it on my chart. Light out, Gallagher, and lights out everyone. - No, come back, please! - If she says her baby's coming, it's coming! - Alright! One more word out of anyone, everybody gets a charge sheet. - Just call the doctor and get her to the hospital, you stupid jerk! - Gallagher, get out of there or I'm writing you up. Look, cut it out, Gallagher! - I hate this damn place! What's the matter with you people? Yoyo! Yoyo! Yoyo, Yoyo! Yoyo, Yoyo! Yoyo, Yoyo! Yoyo, Yoyo! Yoyo, Yoyo! Yoyo, Yoyo! - It's Gallagher, she's going nuts! Yoyo, Yoyo! - Take your hands off of me! Yoyo, Yoyo! Yoyo, Yoyo! - Let go! Yoyo, Yoyo! Yoyo, Yoyo! Stop! Let go of me! Yoyo, Yoyo! Yoyo, Yoyo! Let go! Let go! Yoyo, Yoyo! - Annie? Yoyo had a baby girl this morning. She's okay, they're both doing fine. I thought you might want to talk, but you don't have to. There are a lot of women in your situation, honey. I think I have some idea of what you're going through. - No, you don't. I'm not like these other women, I don't belong here. - Nobody thinks they belong here, honey. You have an ID, you're in a cell. That makes you just like everyone else. In the 15 years I've been coming here I've seen two kinds of women. The kind that allows herself to be defeated by this place and the kind that doesn't. Now, you're going to have to decide which kind you're going to be. - Please! Please, you've gotta help me. I'm not gonna make it. I'm not. I've gotta go home, I've gotta go home to my kids. How am I going to get out of here? Please, please, you gotta help. - I know you don't want to hear this, Annie, but you're going to have to help yourself. You're the only one who can. - I don't think I can make it through it, I can't do it. Please, please, I can't do it. I got my work assignment changed. - Good. It looks like you've had a successful first day. - Yeah, sure beats the cell block. A person can go crazy in there. Sometimes I think they want you to go crazy, you know. - If you feel useless you'll give up hope. Look at this! I've got just the person for this. - I mean, he was acting like a dick. Ooh, look who we got here! Miss A1 felony! What you got there? - It's a toy for one of the babies. I got a pass. - Wait, I've gotta check for contraband. - Hi. - Hi. She's gorgeous. - Pearl, baby, say hi to your Tia Annie. - Hi, Pearl. - I named her after my mother. She's dead a long time. I wish she could have seen her, you know? Do you want to hold her? - Yes. Here we go. I got her. See, you always have to support their head. - You gotta come see me. I don't wanna mess up. Nobody helps us, you know? - Of course, I will. - Mothers are lucky here, Annie. We get to keep them for a year. But I gotta do right so she'll remember I'm her mother. - They never forget their mothers. They never forget. Here's my girls, hi! Where's Shawn? - He felt sick this morning. - Cath, if Shawn still has the flu maybe he should see a doctor. - He wanted to stay home and watch the playoffs. What am I going to do? I can't force the kid if he doesn't want to come. - Look at you, look how big you are. Let me fix your barrette. - Okay. - Shawn's okay, Mom. - Thanks, Kel. How about you, how are you doing? - Fine. - How's school, how are your grades? You are so pretty. Any boys you like? How about it, Lisa, is your sister going on any dates? - I don't know. - Mom. Honey, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to embarrass you I just, I miss the way we used to talk about everything. I want to know what's going on in your life. I want you to know that you can come to me about anything. - Sure Mom, I know. - Kel, Kelly take your sister and play for a sec, I've gotta talk to your mom. - Come on, Lisa. - There's some stuff I gotta tell you and I didn't know how to put it in a letter. Mike and me are splitting up. - Why? - Why not? It's only been the worst year of everyone's life. He's, he's seeing somebody else. God, Cathy, I'm sorry. - Yeah, well, I just wanted you to know. I don't know what's going to happen, but I'm keeping the kids with me. - It's because of my kids, isn't it? Mike never wanted kids. - Annie, look, you're the one sitting up here with all the time on your hands. So you figure out the how and the why and you tell me because I don't even have time to hear myself think anymore. I'm just, I'm just telling you, okay? - Cath, Cath I want you to know how grateful I am for everything. - What am I going to do, put your kids out on the street? Then I'd really be able to live with myself. - Mommy, Mommy, Mommy! Can I buy a soda? - Yeah, sure. - You let her call you Mommy? - 1,284 women in this hell hole and usually I'm the only one here. - I lost my appeal. I wanted to look up some of this legal stuff. It's kind of hard to understand. - You're the white girl with the three A1 felonies. - That's right. - I keep track of what people are in for. Kind of a special interest of mine. You'd be surprised how many women do more time than they have to. Seems nobody told them they can read these books for themselves. - You think I'm doing too much time? I'm going for my second appeal and basically I was framed. - First of all, everybody says they were framed. Second, ain't no judge interested in admitting that any DA messed up fighting the war on drugs. That's a holy war, don't you know? So you can forget about that second appeal. - Well, thanks for the free advice. But I just saw my seven year old daughter call my sister Mommy, so if it's all the same to you I think I'll go for the appeal. - It's your time if you want to waste it. But what you should be going for is clemency. - I can do that? I thought you had to go through this whole appeals process. - Hey, you gotta do what your lawyer says. I mean, he's a white man in a suit, probably charging you a hundred dollars an hour. I'm just some uneducated black bitch. What would I know? See, the beauty of clemency is that they never have to admit that they were wrong to try you in the first place. Or give you a new trial and be forced to admit that you were innocent from the word go. See, clemency saves a lot of face because instead of saying they were wrong, they can say they're being generous by releasing you, guilty or not. But in order to get clemency you need to prove certain extenuating circumstances. For example, you're doing time for being in the garage while the drug deal was going on inside. Even though that white boy who actually sold the coke to the cops only got probation. See, two people who are considered guilty cannot be punished so differently for the same crime. - Shawn can sleep on the sofa bed and the three of us will share the bedroom. Don't look at me like that, it's all I can afford. You think I like this? You think I want to live like this? - Hey, you're looking good. Look, I just want you to read this over before I file the second appeal. We're on to the next step. - I thought I was going to be out in a few months. It's almost a year now. - Annie, you can't hold me responsible for... No, I hold myself responsible. I walked into 15 years to life because I was too naive to understand the whole system is built on plea bargains. I could have had one to three. - And you knew that. - Yeah, like I knew I couldn't get out if I was appealing an A1 felony. I mean, I heard it, but I didn't think I the had anything to do with me. I mean, I wasn't going to get convicted. All I knew was that innocent people always got off in the movies. I kept believing that's what was going to happen in real life. - Come on, Annie, sit down. - I'm going to handle my own case, Marty. - Annie, you're making a big mistake. - I don't have any more time to waste. My kids are out there without a mother. - Where the hell is Shawn? - How the hell should I know? - Hey, watch your mouth. - Okay you guys, I'll see you when I get back. - I made you grilled cheese. Honey, I'm sorry, I don't have time. They kept me forever at the office. If I'm late to the store again I'm going to lose my cashier job. How was school? - I hate it, everybody already knows everybody. - I know. Well, give it time, you'll make friends. Lots of them. Lock up behind me. - Can I have some milk? - Hello? Hi Mrs. Hansen. No, my mom's not here right now. I told her you called. Okay, I'll write it down. PTA pancake breakfast, Saturday at ten. Right, volunteer, 555-6437. Yeah, I'm writing it down, bye. - Now what about those letters of support? Your priest, your kids' teachers. Anyone who'll tell the Governor what a saint you are. How you've been a credit to the community. - Most of those people don't even know I'm in jail, Charisse. I've gotta have them write letters? - Only if you wanna get out. And here's the fun part. They want an essay from you. - Well, what do I have to say? - Tell them what they want to hear. How being in prison has changed you, set you on the straight and narrow. They want to hear about all the valuable lessons you've learned. - All the valuable lessons I've learned. Well, I've learned how to pick locks. Evelyn taught me how to do that. I know the best way to forge a check without getting caught. - Where to hide contraband. - Right. Shanae taught me how to do corn rows. Here's another very valuable lesson I learned in prison. How to fill out a clemency petition. You know what? If I get out of here I'm going to do things a lot differently. - You did what you thought was right at the time. - Maybe. No, I got myself into this mess. All I know is I can't go back to thinking the way I used to think. All my life I've been a good girl. You know, I trusted people, I expected people to do the right thing. My husband, Danny Jenkins. One thing for sure, if I get out of here, I'm not going to let other people tell me what to do. - When you get out. - When I get out of here. I'm going to do a lot more for my kids. I'm going to get a better job. I'm going to go back to school. - Girl, you'll be lucky to get back to where you were before you came here. - Annie, I'd like to talk to you. We had a call from your sister. - What? What is it? - It's Kelly, she's in the hospital. But she's going to be okay. - What happened? - Stomach hemorrhage, internal bleeding. She swallowed a bottle of aspirin, Annie, but your son found her in time. She's going to be okay. - Kelly! - It's alright, I'll take care of her. She just got some bad news, that's all. - I heard about your girl. Is she gonna be alright? - I can't, I never thought she'd do anything like this. I keep thinking I should have seen it. Like here she says she's making dinner every night and how she's a big girl and that I shouldn't worry about her. And I read that and I think wow, she's doing great. Because that's what I needed to believe, that's what I wanted. You know, instead of thinking what that must have been like for her. And how that must have felt. How maybe she wanted me to worry about her. - Seems like to me you'll find out all kind of reasons in them letters if you study them hard enough. Because that's all you've got to try to make sense of it is them letters. And you know you going to keep trying to make sense of it. Got me a daughter. That's Roxanne, she 12 in that picture. Foster care, they ain't brought her to see me in three years. I don't know where she at. And the social worker, she damn sure ain't no help. You know what I'm saying? - That's what I'm afraid's going to happen to Kelly. I'll just, I'll just lose track of her. How am I going to be her mother two hours every other weekend? - So is that her? - Willie, thanks. - Well, you ain't no new girl no more. You know what it's about. - Here you go. You're going to be with these nice Dominican people in my old neighborhood and they're even Catholic which I asked for special. And all my friends can come see you, so you're going to be okay. Wait a minute. - The foster parents are waiting. - I know. I just don't want you to forget her stuff. This is her favorite. See, you got fuzzy bunny. He want to go with you too, see? You're gonna be okay, Pearl. Te amo. - Yoyo, she'll be fine. - You don't gotta baby me. Just leave me alone, I ain't your little girl. You want to play mommy, you do it with these kids here. - I'm sorry I'm late. - Bless you all for coming. We're worried about our kids. The kids of the women incarcerated here. We know they're good kids, but we've been told by the experts they have a 10 times greater chance of ending up in prison than kids whose mothers are at home with them. And, to be honest, you're the ones paying for all those new prisons. So it's your problem as much as it is ours. We want to keep the mothers here from losing touch with their kids. Now believe me, no matter what they're in here for, nobody loves their kids more. And there's nobody a kid needs more than mom. And with your help we want to start a program for the kids this summer. We'll bring them up for the entire week and they'll spend every single day with their mothers, just like a real family. But we will need places for them to stay and we have no money. So we are asking for families in the area to volunteer to put up a kid for a week. Annie, could you come up front please? - Go ahead, go on. - Come on, you can do it. - I wonder what she's in here for? - I'm so nervous I think I'm going to throw up. I'm Annie Gallagher and I'm representing the women here tonight and to answer any questions. - How many of you are mothers? - About 80 percent, that's the national average which means there are about 400,000 kids affected by their mother's incarceration. - And most of us are single mothers. Unlike men, when they go to jail, they usually have a wife or a girlfriend to help keep the family together. But the kids in foster care, they only get taken maybe once a year to see their mothers. So we thought with the summer program we could make it easier to get mothers and kids and... - Excuse me. Yes. - I'm not convinced it should be easier to bring children here. And, I don't know why I'm being asked to feel sorry for these women. I didn't put them in jail. You got yourselves locked up by breaking the law. - Okay, but 90% of us are in here for non-violent crimes. We've made mistakes, but we still love our kids and we're still capable of helping them. - Damn straight! - Maybe the best thing you could do for your kids is to just stay out of their lives. - Come on, honey, let's just go. - No, no I think it's a valid question. I'm not convinced that a kid ought to be hanging around a prison, anyway. You know maybe you should just let them alone and do your time. - But they're doing my time, that's the point. It's my kids who are being punished. Look at these letters on the wall from our kids. You want me to leave my kids alone, mister? You have no idea how alone they are. My daughter Kelly, she's 14 and she's shy. By the time I get to talk to her, I mean really talk to her, it's time to go. And I know she needs to be with her mother more. She swallowed a bottle of pills after I came here. And Shawn, he used to be really good in school. He's 12 and now he gets in trouble all the time. So far I haven't even been able to get him up here and I need to find out what's going on with him. And Lisa, my little one who, she can't just come and sit in the visitor's chair. We have to be able to do things together. My kids were fine before I came here and now I'm really afraid. If you don't care about us, I can accept that. But let me ask you a question. What crime did our kids commit that nobody should care about them? - We need a commitment from at least 20 host families as part of the proposal we're submitting to the state. You signed the clemency petition, right? - Right and my letter to the Governor. - Still raining out? - Cats and dogs. Hi, Mr. Riley. Let's celebrate. After all that red tape they finally gave in. We have got our summer program! - If we can just figure out how to get the kids up here and find places for them to stay. - Real pepperoni! - Miss Francis, you are something! - I cannot believe that I'm going to get to see my kids for a whole week! - Girl, there's all kinds of prison. - Will you all shut the hell up? The whole world ain't interested in your damn conversation. - Let it go. - See, I don't like writing stuff. I like to use the phone. - Don't think of it as writing. Think of it like you're just talking to Roxanne and then you're copying it down. Read me what you have so far. - Dear Roxanne, how are you Roxy? I've been thinking about you every day because I miss you so much. I know... I know I ain't wrote you... I, see, see? It's all messed up, it don't even sound right. - It sounds like a mother telling her daughter she loves her. It's fine. Do you want me to copy it over for you? - No. I want her to know I wrote it myself. Maybe you can look at it later, see if I misspelled something by mistake. See, 'cause this pen ain't working and my hand is hurting. I know I ain't wrote you because the social worker say she lost your address to the new foster home. But my friend Annie, she helped me to find you and now I know where you at, baby. And I want you to come and see me 'cause it hurts me that we haven't seen each other for so long. - So all you have to do now is write down the summer program information, put a stamp on it. She's going to be so happy to hear from you. - Hey guys, deal me in. Honey, that's great, I can't wait to see you. What about Shawn? He's coming, right? - I don't know. - Well, did you ask him? If it's about Little League I can have Aunt Cathy call the coach. Mom, Shawn's not in Little League anymore. - Since when? What happened? - I don't know, he quit a long time ago. - Kelly, Kelly I really want Shawn to come, too. So ask him, will you honey? Please, just ask him. Kelly, are you there? - Ask him yourself, Mom. - Shawn? Shawn, honey? Shawn? Shawn honey, please, please come. I really want to see you. Please? I love you. My Jimmy, my Jimmy, Jimmy! Jimmy, over here! - Do you see her? - I don't see mine either. - Damn, Cookie, stop hogging everything! Alright now! - Alright, alright! - Officer Wilson, couldn't I just vouch for the boy? He's come such a long way. - Come on, you know I can't do that. I got a family to feed and you're asking me to get fired. - Reginald, your mama really wants to see you. Are you sure you didn't bring some kind of ID? - There's my Pearl. Come to mama, baby. You walk so good now. - We had a little problem with Reginald, but I think it can be worked out by tomorrow. He lost his ID. - They ain't gonna let him in? - There she is! - See that, I told you she wasn't coming. - Willie, wait. - Mom. God, I missed you guys. - Are we just going to stay in this room all week? Gross. - We're going to do a lot of stuff, Shawn. Hey, I'm really glad you came. It must have been awful for you. - Not really. - Come up here, honey. Were you scared? - I wasn't really anything. I guess I just felt empty. Kind of, I don't really remember, Mom. - I remember Kelly. I remember it was Tuesday, March the 3rd. It was ten minutes after nine when Frances came and told me you were in the hospital. And I prayed, I prayed for you all night. I love you so much, honey. And you don't deserve everything that's happened to you. But you have to promise me that you'll never, ever hurt yourself again. Your life is so precious, honey. - It's so hard sometimes. And I want it to be like before. - I know, honey. I know, just let it out. Go ahead and cry. She just missed the first couple of days, that's all. She'll be here. - She ain't coming. - Hey, Annie. Ain't my kids something? - Seven, lucky, lucky seven. - Come on, Lisa, you've got to count. Uncle Mike called Aunt Cathy and they talked on the phone for like hours. Really? What's going on with them? - Aunt Cathy won't say. - Come on, your turn. - How could you be so stupid? How could you not know the guy was a drug dealer? - You want to know the truth, Shawn? The truth is I don't know. I don't know how I could have been so stupid. I've thought about it as much as you have. Shawn! - That's bull, that's bull and you know it! - Shawn! - It's like we come all the way out here, like it's supposed to change something. But it doesn't change anything, Mom. You're still gonna be here and everything's still gonna suck! - Shawn come back here, I'm talking to you! - So what, what are you gonna do, punish me? - Shawn! Shawn! - Stop it, no, I hate you! - Okay, okay, listen to me. Listen to me! I'm doing everything I can to get out of here. I'm having everybody I know write letters to the Governor. I don't want to be here. I want to be with you. But I have to be able to count on you to keep our family together until I get out of here. - Right. And how the hell am I supposed to do that? - Well you could start by not making it worse. Honey, honey, I'm sorry. - Everybody remember your lunch, juice will be on the bus. I love you guys. We know, Mom. - Well, I don't get to tell you all the time so I have to tell you extra when you come to visit me. Write to me, okay? Maybe it'll be a little easier now that we got caught up. Post card, you know, I'm not picky. I just want to know how it's going. And you don't have to cheer me up all the time. I want to know what's really going on. - Sure, Mom. - Annie, come here. Do you see Roxanne? They told me to come down here. They tell me she here. - Willie, that's great. - Yeah, but I don't see her nowhere. I've just been walking around here. Annie, you gotta help me look I'm too worked up. I can't even think straight. - Okay, okay. Now, I remember her picture, but well, she'd be bigger now, wouldn't she? - Yeah, you're right. I gotta be looking for a big girl. Her hair probably different, you know. Roxanne? - Mama? My God. No. - Hey, mama! - What have you done with yourself? What have you been doing? - You guys take care of each other, okay? Wait, let me read you this one. This is one of my favorites. Dear Mr. Government, I'm writing you 'cause my mommy doesn't belong in jail. 'Cause when I was young my mommy went to her friend's house and police got her 'cause he said she was selling drugs to him when she wasn't. So she got in jail. We love her and she doesn't belong there. Please mister Government, please get her out soon. Love, her daughter Lisa. - Dear mister Government. I know. Come on, Yoyo, take it easy. Everybody back in your cell, now! What's wrong with Yoyo? What's the matter? - Her daughter got killed this morning. Foster care, some kind of car accident. My, God. - No, stay away Gallagher, she's gone off. - Let me go talk to her. - No, wait. - She's gonna hurt herself. - Wait! Come on, Yoyo, let's go to the infirmary, okay? - Please, just let me go in there. - Go ahead, maybe she'll listen to you. - My baby, they killed my baby! - No, it's Annie, it's Annie. My baby's dead! - Back in your cells, move, now! - I'm here. My baby! - Annie, it's lockup. - It's okay. Please? God. - Okay, I'll be here, honey. I'll be here, I'll be here. - You said Yoyo was worried about what her baby was going to be buried in. - Are they going to let her go to the funeral? - In chains, but they're going to let her go. That's beautiful. - You okay? - Yeah. - The hearing's tomorrow isn't it? You ready? - Ready as I'll ever be. Wouldn't hurt to pray for me, though. - What I'm trying to say is no matter what anybody says I did when you punish me you punish my kids even more and they didn't do anything to deserve that. - Ms. Gallagher do you understand that if this board should decide to recommend you for clemency you will in no way be exonerated for the crimes for which you were sentenced? - I know, nobody cares whether I'm innocent or not. But I've already been here more than three years. And that's longer than I would have had to serve if I'd accepted the plea of one to three that the DA offered me at the trial. And instead of one to three I'm doing 15 to life. It's like, it's like I'm being punished because I demanded my constitutional right to a trial. If they were willing to offer me one to three then, why not now? I just, I just want to go home to my kids. Please. - I know we're all bummed 'cause the kids got snowed out, but I got presents so listen up everybody. You first Miss Frances. - Cookie, you shouldn't have. - I got you a new car. I seen that piece of junk you been driving. Annie, I figured you wanting to be with your kids so bad what you needed was one of them family getaways. How you get 'em down to Florida is your problem. - I can't believe this is the fourth Christmas without my kids. - Still no word from the Governor? - No. Okay, who's having eggnog? Frances tried to spike it, I caught her just in time. - No fair peeking. - What have you guys been up to? - You can open your eyes now. Merry Christmas, Aunt Cathy! - I can't believe you guys did all this! - Kelly made the turkey and I stuffed it. - And I mashed the potatoes. - It looks wonderful! - And we're all going to clean up the kitchen so you don't have to do a thing. - Gosh. I'm so sorry we didn't get up to see your mom today. - We're gonna save a leg in the freezer for when she gets her clarency. - And some mashed potatoes, too. - It's clemency, Lisa. - You know this is the best Christmas present I've ever had. Really. I don't tell you guys very often how much you've meant to me. I really love you. - Well, dig in. - Merry Christmas. You do a double? Yeah. Where's your ID? - Get a life, Jackie. Happy New Year! It's from the Governor. Well, none of this would be happening if it wasn't for you. Doesn't seem fair. - No such thing as fair, I thought I told you that. - Will you call my cousin? Tell her to write to me? - I'll call, don't worry. You're gonna be okay. - I'm so used to walking in here and seeing your face I don't know what I'm going to do. - You saved my life, you know? You and the kids. - You did it, Annie. I'm so proud of you. - I've been dreaming about this day for so long. I don't know why I'm so nervous. It'll be fine. - I've got 40 dollars, no place to live, a prison record and three kids I hardly know. - You're welcome to stay. - No thanks. - Well, so long, girl. You know I always figured you'd get out of here before I did. - Well if you just stay out of trouble you'd be out in no time. - Well you know what, you're gonna miss me Gallagher. 'Cause I'm gonna haunt your dreams. - Mom! Mom! Mama!
