"These nights, new and old" "These nights, new and old" "Speak of many tales untold" Good or bad I've had the habit of writing everything. Today after 8 years, I felt like writing again.. Slowly things are falling into place. Especially Mini.. Hopefully next week, I will be able to take Mini to America. - Goodnight Mumma. - Goodnight. The doctor keeps warning me that I am wasting my money. There is no guarantee that Mini will walk again after the operation. But..What is life without hope? Today I gave the nurse a day off.. Mini and I spent the whole Sunday messing about. We cooked.. Cleaned the house.. I didn't do much Mini did most of the work. "Today is only that is here heed my advice," "This is the secret of happiness" "Don?t haggle, enjoy fully " "Heart, don?t be formal crazy" "You won?t get it again fill your mouth with" "Rasgulles (syrupy dessert) of the moments" Happy. And in the night we had the mother daughter ludo championship. As usual Mini was winning.. But how could I let that happen "Rasgulles (syrupy dessert) of the moments" I know she saw me cheat.. But she let me win. Nobody loves me like Mini does.. No..no..Mamma.. Mamma.. Mini! Mini..Mini I am here. It's okay.. Mamma.. It's just a bad dream. Nothing will happen to you as long as I'm alive. Sister, open the door. Mini .. [Regional song] 7:25? Why didn't the alarm.. Mini ..Wake up. I am late. Darling, wake up.. Please call the nurse.. Mini get up.. Call the Nurse.. You call. My phone is dead. This rubbish phone of yours. It dies every day.. Why don't you buy a new phone? Because I don't have money to waste! GET UP! Mamma why did you swtich the fan off? C'mon Mini .. I'm getting really late. Please call the Nurse. The number you are trying to reach, is currently not reachable. The number you are trying to reach.. I can't get through to her mobile. Maybe she is on the train. What rubbish! She should have been here at 6. I am so late. Then go. Call her again. I will be okay. She will be here any time now. You sure you will be okay? Or should I wait? Oh ho, Mumma please go! - Sure? - Yes. - That nurse.. - Mamma please go! Call her from the train.. But my phone is dead! Anyway your clothes are there.. - I'm leaving the door open.. - Okay. - Please be careful. - Okay. - Mamma? - Huh? Don't be a miser.. take a rickshaw.. Bye! Bye. Benu uncle! Benu uncle! Bidya.. Benu uncle, please will you keep a look out for Mini.. What happened? Nothing. I am late for office. The nurse is on her way. Till she comes.. - Yes. Don't worry. I will check. - Thank you!!

Boss has been waiting since morning.. - Vidya.. - One second.. - Hello. - Hello.. Hello.. Thank god you came.. Where's Mini? - In the toilet. - Why were you late? You must come at 6 a.m sharp! Yes.. Sorry. What happened to your voice? I have a sore throat. Make sure Mini does her school work. And don't go too near to Mini. I don't want her to get any infection. Vidya!! Come on.. Coming.. Coming. Sorry! Sorry ! Sorry. You are an unique sample! Hello doctor? Vidya, when are you treating me to some good sweets? What's that famous sweet of Chandan Nagar? - "JOLBHORA"? - Madam, please take this. Whenever you say, doctor.. Now? I have a good news.. What news doctor? Mini's confirmation has come through with Dr. Andrews. You can take her to America. But I hope you realise.. There is no guarantee that Mini will get better. You still want to go? Bidya ? Yes. I want to go. That's the spirit. Listen, my travel agent has done your passports and visa and left them with me. Come quickly and take them. But remember.. I am not giving them unless you get me some sweets.. - Okay? - Yes doctor. Bye. Mini? Mini? Why are the lights off? Mini? Hello.. Where are you both? I am in my house. What? Where is Mini? And why are you in your house? You told me not to come. I spoke to you from my office. You said.. What do you mean "I told you"? I was on my way to your house. You called and said not to come.. I called you? Yes. Uncle.. - Uncle.. - What happened? Uncle did you see Mini? - Huh? - Mini? Yes. I went in the morning. Checked on her. Gave her some juice. - Then? - You told me the nurse has come. I told you? - Yes, you called and told me.. - When? Let me.. Around eleven? But I never called you. My phone's ringing.. Mini! Hello.. You saw the photo? Who are you? Where's my daughter? You've forgotten me? You want to see Mini alive for the last time? Listen you must have made a mistake? If you interrupt me one more time, I am going to hang up. If you want to see Mini alive come to that address right now.. Please don't do anything to Mini.. Hello? Hello? Hello? You want to see Mini alive for the last time.. ..come to that address right now.. You want to see Mini alive for the last time.. ..come to that address right now.. You want to see Mini alive for the last time.. Sir.. Indrojeet Singh has come from the police station.. Who? Indrojeet Singh. Doctor Maity? Sub-inspector Inderjeet Singh. You reported a hit and run? Yes, yes..But only hit not run. He bought her in. I swear, sir.. I did not hit her.. - She just ran in front of my car.. - Stop it. Go, sit there. Don't move till I come back. Where's the victim? Come.. I haven't seen you before in Chandan Nagar.. Why? You get a police case everyday? No, No.. I had gone to the police station but did not see you there. I just got transferred last week. Oh! There.. What is her condition? That is the problem. She seems to have gone into a coma. Coma? Yes. It is an acute case of TBI.. Traumatic Brain Injury.. But I don't think it's permanent. I am expecting her to recover in the next five to six days.. But inspector.. I have a different problem. Her treatment is very expensive.. Who will bear her medical expenses? At most I can keep her for two days, beyond that it'll be very difficult.. It's ok Doctor. I am sure she has someone. Doctor, can you remove this mask for a second? I need to see her face. Open it. Durga?! No no.. Bidya. Vidya? Yes. She is not Durga.. She is Bidya, Bidya Sinha. Vidya Sinha? How do you know? Put it back. See.. this was with her. When she was brought in. Vidya Sinha. You know her? No. - Come with me.. - Yes, sir. Suddenly she came in front.. Happened in this junction.. - Here? - Yes. Hey Police, hands up! Hands up! Stop crying.. Which way did she run in from? Hands up! Hands up! I'll put you in jail! I'll put you in jail! O dada! Yes. You know this woman? This is Bidya madam. Where does she stay? Who is it? Police. Police? Why? You know her? One second.. This is our Bidya.. I came down and saw no one is here.. I only locked up the house. You locked up? Yes. I have a spare key, in case Mini needs any help. Who's Mini? Her daughter. She has a daughter?! Yes. How old is she? 14 ,15 I don't know.. But the poor child is paralyzed. Where is she now? Not very sure. Bidya also was asking where is Mini? You said Mini is paralyzed? Yes. Below the waist. Her wheelchair is here.. How can she go anywhere? I don't know. Maybe the nurse knows.. You have the nurse's number? It's on that board. Are you really in a coma or are you trying to escape from me? But how will you escape death Durga? You are not answering.. I'll have to check myself.. Sorry I don't have the time to clean this.. Okay then. I won't kill Mini till you regain.. Who are you? This is not visiting time. Strange.. So Vidya asked you not to come today? Yes. Ok Uncle.. Uncle.. You go up and rest. Rashmi.. Have you forgotten? - What? - You have a wife, a daughter.. I'll have to die to forget that. Tsk Tsk. What rubbish you speak! Why? You love me that much? Nope. Please talk to your daughter. She is driving me crazy. Daddy, I want a dog.. That is you mothers department please ask her.. I asked. She said either she will stay in the house or the dog. Good. This is good news. Then maybe we should get a dog immediately.. Why? You found another wife? Joking yaar! When you coming home? Have you seen the time? Simran is also waiting for you.. You said 9 p.m.. It's midnight now! Is this any time to come home? Come back quickly. Have you had dinner? Have you eaten anything? Rashmi.. Rashmi hold on.. I am coming.. Give me a minute.. Do you want to tell me something? What? Why? You look like it. Why? You want to say something? Yes. Speak. Can we go back to Kolkata? What? We just shifted a week back! It's so boring here! Everyone goes to sleep by 9 p.m. It's like this only in small towns. What? Everyone goes to sleep at nine. Then why are we awake? What happened? Nothing. She is not Durga.. Bidya. - Who's Mini? - Her daughter. Something really distubed me a lot today. But I don't know whether I heard it correctly.. Or was it a voice from my own childhood. It began as a routine day at school.. [Prayer] Same old school work. Fees, Syllabus etc etc.. But the person I wanted to turn up didn't seem likely today. Then maybe I spoke too soon.. As usual Mini Dewan was marched into the Principal's office. My only respite in an otherwise boring day. It happened atleast once every week. Stay here. Sit. But Mini never looked at me. She just sits quietly playing with her paper toys. I tried many times to be her friend. To talk to her. But all my attempts flopped. It was impossible to be friends with Mini Dewan. Today Mrs. Burnett was a little more angry than usual. Mrs. .. Oh. She is not there? No. Durga! I just don't understand what to do with this girl! First she didn't use to pay attention.. Now she has started falling asleep during my class.. You keep on sitting here! Nonsense. I couldn't stop myself from laughing. And then the day changed.. Mini smiled at me for the first time. Diksha.. Rosni.. Today her car was late.. So I gave it another shot. Hello.. Your car is late today. You fell asleep in class today? Your car's here.. Do you know my name? My name is Durga. Even I used go fall asleep in my class. Especially in Maths.. Is Mrs. Burnett very boring? Must be. She looks it. No. Good grief. You can speak? Mrs.Burnett is not boring. No? Then Maths is boring? Maths is not boring. Mrs. Burnett is not boring. Then why did you fall asleep in class? Because they don't let me sleep in the night. I didn't understand what Mini said. But before I could ask, the car left. Because they don't let me sleep in the night. I don't know why I buy fruits everyday.. I don't like fruits.. But I need to change.. The doctor said I must eat fruits for my skin to improve.. And I want to look better. But not for myself.. for Arun. Durga. I desperately wanted to give life a second chance.. I met Arun in kalimpong last year.. I think he likes me. Even though I am not sure if I can give him what he wants. Are you alright? Yes. Sure? You seemed lost.. No. I was just quiet. Really? Really.. Why? Because we just walked past your house.. Durga.. Would you like to come out for dinner tonight? I wanted to say YES but.. Arun.. today.. Not a problem. No need to rush. Whenever you're comfortable.. The restaurant isn't going anywhere.. - It can't also.. - What? Restaurant. Ah yes. But I can go.. Bye! Bye. I was angry with myself for saying no to Arun.. But I could not get what Mini said out of my head. Because they don't let me sleep in the night. Something really distubed me a lot today. But I don't know whether I heard it correctly.. Or was it a voice from my own childhood.. Wake up! Are you reading a book? No. It's a diary. Whose diary? Looks like a school diary. It's evidence. From that hit and run.. I didn't even know.. What? That you can read. Ha Ha ha.. - Ramsingh come. - Yes, sir. Call this nurse. Ask her to come in.. and also.. where do you record all case related materials? What, sir? Case related materials, evidence? Like this. From the accident case.. Does this station have a book for recording? No sir. Nothing happens here in Chandan Nagar. Nothing happens? It's happening now? Yes. Go buy one. - Yes sir. - Thank you. Over the next few days, I tried talking to Mini.. I never got a chance.. Ma'am. 3 one's are 3..3 two's are 6.. I didn't know who to talk to.. And I know from my own past.. ..that there is no point in talking to anyone without proof.. I needed to get close to Mini. That's the only way she would talk to me. I needed a plan. That day after school, I looked through Mini's records. I found Mini was weak in Maths and English. I had completely forgotten about Arun that week.. So has she vanished? Guard? It's okay.. I don't know.. Didn't I tell you? Hi. Sorry. I did not hear from you all week. I , got worried.. So I..came here. Yes. Please. I wasn't used to people caring for me.. I forgot my umbrella. You are wet. - Bye.. - Bye.. Arun.. Yes. Keep them here. I was scared. I always wanted to hide from everyone I wanted to be left alone I don't want anyone to touch me. I'm so Sorry.. You okay? I need some water. But I need to get used to life.. If I have to start a new life.. I have to forget my childhood. I want to be normal. I want Arun to like me.. I don't want Arun to hate me like Inder.. Sir.. The nurse is here. Hello sir. How are you so sure that Mini is Vidya's daughter? Sir her name is Mini Sinha. Vidya Sinha's daughter Mini Sinha. Apart from that? Sir she loves MIni more than her life. Only a mother can love that much. So where is this Mini? I don't know. Maybe Dr. Sen will know. Dr. Sen? Mini's doctor in Kolkata. Sir.. Dr. Maity's phone. You know his address? Yes. Please write it for me.. Thank You. Dr. Maity? - Call Dr. Maity. - Yes, sir. I am here to see Vidya Sinha.. Oh, she is very popular today! Why? Who else came to see her? That lady who just went out.. - The one in blue? - Yes. Sir police has come. - This is my mobile number. - Okay, sir. If any one comes to meet Vidya Sinha, call me immediately. Okay sir. If you get me on my mobile, call me at home on this number. Okay sir. - Tell me.. - Yes, sir. Did she have a mobile when she was brought in? - I don't know, sir. - Did you find any relatives? - Find out. - Yes, sir. I think I found one but she ran away. All relatives are like that. They run away. But inspector I can't keep her more than one day.. It's too expensive for me. I needed to know what Mini meant. And I was going to do whatever I could to find out.. Who was not letting her sleep? Guard? Is there someone home? - Yes. Inside. - Okay. I am Mini's grandmother. Hello. Sit. Tell me. I had it all set. I am from Mini's school. There is some concern with Mini's performance. You are in my house. You must first introduce yourself.. Sorry.. My name is Durga Rani Singh. You are from Kalimpong? No. I was in Delhi and then in Kolkata for some time.. Married? No. You are a teacher in Mini's school? I lied. Yes. Yes..Bye Mom! Please tell me.. I explained to her that Mini's performance.. ..in English and Mathematics were poor.. and the school wanted to help her with extra tuitions. So Mini has to stay back in school for an extra hour? Only two days a week. This was the only way I could get Mini alone. Mini is only 6 years old. It's not as if she is doing some IAS exams. No need to do all this now. I'll call the headmistress and thank her. Thank you. Oh no! That's the last thing I needed. Her contacting the school.. But it's only an hour after school.. No. I was losing. Last attempt.. I could come home and help Mini.. We are doing this with some other students. You are doing this with other students also? I lied again. Yes. Yes, sir. I will be there. Sir, she did not have a mobile.. Okay. Sir. There you are Inder.. You are back. Sir! I was coming to see you only.. No no sit sit.. Listen. Get me some tea. I got a call from Maity's nursing home. - There is one hit and run case.. - Yes, sir I was there.. We need to move the victim to a government hospital. Sir have you gone mad? Excuse me? Patient is in a temporary coma.. Sir..It's only a matter of time for her to come around. Who will pay for her expenses? I am sure she has someone. Have you found anyone? Not yet, but.. That's what the doctor told me. So who will pay? You? Please think before you address your seniors. Anyway.. More important matters.. See.. What happened to that tea? What is this? Durga Rani Singh. Wanted for kidnapping and murder. What? Dangerous woman. Sir tea? She kidnapped a child in Kalimpong.. And when someone tried to stop her, she murdered that person. She has been spotted in Chandan Nagar. Once Kalimpong police arrives you will be working with them to find this woman. Rubbish sir. She can't be a murderer. How do you know? You know her? Sir.. look at her face? Look You think she can kill someone? My gut feel says that this girl is not a murderer.. Inder you were all set to get a promotion to Lalbazar, right? You messed up your last case with your gut feeling. And instead of a promotion to Lalbazar.. you got demoted to Chandan Nagar.. So if I were you.. I would rely a little less on my gut feeling. Sorry sir. Sir, got a new book. We can record evidence here. What evidence? This diary? Have you gone mad Ramsingh? What did I tell you? I asked you for a diary like this? Not some exercise book.. You forgot? Get me another diary like this.. Thank you. Go now. Whose diary is that? This? This is my wife's diary. This is over. She wanted another one.. - Oh your wife's diary? - Yes. Good. So find out what she thinks about you.. Inder, this hit and run case.. Who's the victim? A local woman. Name? Vidya Sinha. Vidya Sinha, okay. Hello. Durga.. Your student. From now she is your responsibility.. And Mini.. You must study properly, School feels you are very behind in class. No.. No.. Nothing like that.. Let me finish, please. So Mini you must study properly. Ma'am you need anything? What would you like to have? Ahhh.. She doesn't want anything. I could see Mini was uneasy seeing me in the house. I needed somthing to make her comfortable. Sit down Mini. And I got it. Ma'am I would need you to leave. It would be better if I could teach Mini alone.. You want me to leave? No.. Not like that.. You know what I mean! I couldn't believe that I winked at the lady. Neither could she.. I was too much in a hurry. Mini, remember what you told me that day? Who doesn't let you sleep in the night? Mini! Mini.. Why are you outside? Mini I asked you a question? Why have you left the room? I asked her to get me some water. Okay. In future just ring the bell next to the table. - The servant will come. - Ok. Come. How could I foget, that unless she wanted to talk herself. I could not force her to talk. What do you want to do? I had to first become her friend. Her confidante. A friend who she can trust and talk to. A friend who I never had. Do you sell water colors? I had read somewhere that painting is a good way to bond with children.. Let's paint. Take. Can I use my fingers? But they will get dirty. Use a brush. I fogot Mini needs to make her own choices. Okay, use your fingers. "Don't give me a thing.." "Just keep this gift of mine.." "My friendship with you.. Without any conditions.." "Consider me know me.. As you compaion.." "Consider me know me.. As you compaion.." "Recognize my face, with your eyes.." Durga let me show you RAJNIGANDHA. Rajnigandha? Yep. Vidya Sinha's Rajnigandha. Who's Vidya Sinha? My favourite actress. I love Vidya Sinha. - "The blue sky of yours.." - What's this? Draw. "Will never be hidden by clods.." "You'll never be harmed.." "Problems wont be able to touch you.." - "I'll complete my promise before my death." - Come.. Where you taking me? My playroom. My god! - See. - You have so many toys? "Consider me know me.." I spent 9 months with Mini.. But I still wasn't any closer to the answer I was looking for.. What happens to you? Sorry.. No..No , it's all right. Madam.. I have to go.. What's this? Seems as if someone is drawing on a repeat loop. Arun made me realise that Mini was not drawing. - She was repeating. - Bye. As if something is happening to her on a repeat loop. Over and over again. These zeroes were like secrets coming out from inside her. And that sceret was hidden somewhere inside this house I'll come back. I had to find it. I needed evidence. Everything was normal. I found nothing. But I didn't know what I was looking for.. All I knew was that what happened to me as a child should not happen to Mini This world doesn't need another Durga. Yes? Sorry.. I was looking for the toilet.. But this is my study.. Not that bad as a toilet.. Is it? No. No. Its nothing like a toilet. In fact very neat and clean. You are here to tutor Mini right? Yes. There is a toilet downstairs also, near the living room. Oh. Okay. Uhh..Sorry. It looked so beautiful. Like Japanese origami. You like origami? - Yes. - Very good! Let me make something for you.. - No No.. Let me not bother you.. - Please. Please. I insist. You are a guest in our house. For you. Thank you. - I better get back to Mini. - Sure. Next to the living room. Sorry? Toilet. I thought you wanted? The food is not good? Not good but very good You approve of the cook? I would hire this cook any day. Good. There's an offer on.. What? You can have this cook for life at a throwaway price.. Plus he will clean the dishes for free. Meaning? I got a promotion. I am now the international manager of my publication. Congratulations! Thank you. But I have to relocate to London.. Oh.. Let me finish. Durga.. I would be honored if you married me and come to London. - Oh.. Arun. - No rush. Take your time I told Arun that I'd give him an answer before he leaves. As much as I was scared of a marriage again.. - Sit down ! - ..I really wanted to be with Arun. Durga! What to do with this child? Again she fell asleep in my class. What's this? Mini how did you hurt yourself? Huh? Mini didn't say a word. But I couldn't take it any more. - Where is Mini? - Upstairs. And running ..running ..running..running..he wins.. Mini? I can't come this Saturday. So I have to teach Mini today. Okay. Come.. Let's change. There's no one in the house. So I was just helping Mini to change. I'll help her. Ok. Mini time to study. We will play later. Come Mini! Ma'am.. Her clothes. I was sure he knew that I knew. I had to move fast. I am very angry today.. Why? This man who I know.. he touched me here. I don't like anybody touching me here or here. Makes me very angry. And it really hurts. Especially here. I was very near to Mini's truth.. I needed to move very carefully. He keeps touching me.. I don't know how to stop them. Me too. Yeah. I don't like it at all. Yeah. One of my friends touched me.. Who touched you Mini? Mohit uncle.. - He keeps.. - Mini! Yes. Mini, you haven't drank your milk.. - Come.. quickly drink your milk.. - Yes, uncle. So you don't like anyone touching you here and there? She is an six year old child. Your own niece. But she likes it when I touch her here and there. What is your problem? Anything that I can fix? But you are grown up now! I will report you. Do it. Do it. And what do you think will happen to Mini if you did? What will happen to you? What if suddenly there are people who want to touch you here and there? I told her what her son was doing with Mini. What? First she couldn't believe it.. Then she understood. I did not know whether I was feeling a sense of victory or relief. But.. Mini was finally safe. I don't understand? Durga we are letting you go. You have brought shame to this school. You have impersonated a teacher and stolen things from the Dewan family. No.. Be glad that the family is not pressing any police charges against you. Ma'am Mini is being abused by her uncle. - What? - Even her grandmother knows this. I had a suspicion and that's why i did all this to find out.. And because I found out, they are not going to the police. Dewans? Are you blind? Durga I know this family personally! Mohit loves Mini like his daughter.. Why would a family abuse their own child? Unfortunately you are the one who's blind. It was useless talking to Mrs.Mason. I did what I should've done long ago. Keep the file. - Yes? - I want to report a child abuse. Him. - Mr.Mohit Dewan? - Yes? - Come this side! - Why? Come this side! What's going on? Where is Mini? Let him go. Sorry Mr. Dewan! What? Why are you letting him go? Mini hasn't said anything which points to him.. ..nor have we found anything in the house which can incriminate anyone. She is a liar. Check with the school. - Sir please listen to me - Please be quiet She pretended to be a teacher and stole from our house. Call Liza Mason in Scottish Missionaries. Liza Mason.. Is this true? - No. - You didn't lie? No I did lie that I'm a teacher. So you are not a teacher? - No I am not a teacher sir. - Then why did you lie? I mean I did pretend to be a teacher.. but not to steal.. - Now you are really wasting my time. - No sir.. Ma'am she is a six year old ma'am. She is a six year old child.. Your own granddaughter. If you to have to save someone save her.. not this monster. Durga.. Durga.. Wait wait.. Durga. I never gave Arun an answer. That night Arun went away to London. I had to choose between Arun and Mini. I chose Mini. Are you still reading? Yes .. Almost done.. I was really missing Arun. Normally he would meet me here. Durga! Do you have any idea, how much my mother loves me? Why did you go to the police, Durga? Because you are a pervert and you need to be in jail. How did you know? I am curious. Are you an expert? Or out of experience? I would say its experience.. ..especially if you don't like being touched here and there. So tell me.. When you grew up.. Did it affect you? Are you married? Can you be normal with your partner? They say these things spoil your sex life, you get scared of sex? Are you also scared? For no reason you ended Mini's life Durga.. And now.. I hope you can live with that. There was something in Mohit's voice.. ..which made me feel very scared for Mini. I needed to see her. I needed to know she is safe. There was no one in the house. Mini? I couldn't find Mini. Mini.. Mini.. Mini.. Mini.. Mini.. Mini.. Mini.. What are you doing out there? Come here. Come inside. Mini.. Mini.. Mini what are you doing here? It's very scary here. Let's go. Its all my fault. What? Grandma told me its all my fault. It would be better if I wasn't there. She did not mean it. You are a very good girl ok? I am a bad girl. Because of me mummy and daddy died.. Because of me Mohit uncle is feeling sad.. It's all my fault. It's not your fault. Everything is going to be okay.. I promise. Come.. Let's go inside. I have to make it right.. Make what right? You don't have to do anything.. Come inside. - Come. - It's all my fault.. - It's not your fault. - Grandma said it's all my fault. You don't have to do anything. Go inside. MINI!! Where are you going at this time of the night? Durga.. I don't know if you can hear me.. What? Police work. Go to sleep or I will put you in jail. Durga.. This is Inder. I am so sorry Durga but you never told me. Today I realized after reading your diary. Durga when we got married we were too young.. ..and we didn't understand much. I didn't know you had so much pain and hurt inside you.. I thought you just didn't like me. DOCTOR! DOCTOR! I am telling you doctor.. Her finger moved.. Where I am saying it didn't? It may have.. But sometimes it happens.. Doesn't mean anything. It's purely a reflex action. But how? Watch. Get me a needle. See? Did anything move? Put some cotton. And what do you think will happen to Mini? For no reason you ended Mini's life Durga. It's all my fault. MINI!! Durga Rani Singh? Yes. May we come in? Why is she here? Durga.. You have filed some serious accusations against my family.. I wanted to explain to you.. You don't have to explain anything to me. It's all with the police. I think it's best we take this matter inside.. ..than to discuss it out here in the open. Come let's go inside. Durga.. Mini is a child.. She says anything she wants.. That doesn't mean it's all true. Mini never got the love of her parents.. And that's why she has been a little mentally unstable since childhood. Mini is not mentally unstable, Mrs. Dewan! It's you and your son who's mentally unstable. Who did all those.. Mohit hasn't done anything to Mini. He has. Mini told me herself. You can't rely on her words! Tomorrow if she says that.. ..you pushed her off the roof and should I believe that? So that's your solution? Try and prove that Mini is mad so nobody believes her? Come on, Durga.. I have known Mini since birth. And that's why you allowed Mohit.. to abuse your own granddaughter whom you know since birth? Mohit loves Mini like his own daughter. That is not love, Mrs. Dewan. That is abuse. Then why didn't Mini say anything till now? Surely she would know the difference between love and abuse.. Tell me, Mrs. Dewan.. How does an six year old know the difference between love and abuse? How does she know.. that when someone touches her private parts, that is not love but abuse. How does that six year old know that there are toys.. but her uncle's private parts is not a toy to play with? How does she know that when her uncle doesn't let her sleep at night.. It's not a game. It's abuse. Tell me Mrs. Dewan? How does an six year old know the difference between love and abuse? Durga.. this is going somewhere else.. So withdraw the case and let's settle this. What do you want? All I want is to see you and your son in jail! If Mini does not know the difference between love and abuse.. it's because of YOU. Durga have you said this to anyone else? No one. Why? Good. You go to the hospital and take care of Mini. I will take care of this one. Please don't hurt her.. She is only a child.. You should have minded your own business.. Mrs. Dewan! Mrs. Dewan!!! Hey? Why in such a hurry to die? Sorry Durga. I didn't have the time to sterilize this.. You are only making it difficult for yourself.. It's up to you whether you want a painful or a painless death. It's very simple.. A lonely girl, unmarried lost her job.. Slashes her wrist in depression. What's that? Nothing. This is going to help you to sleep. But I don't want to sleep. I want to go home. Didn't uncle and I give you so many toys and dresses? So that you don't tell anyone outside? Did we not give you? But you didn't do what I told you to do.. I am sorry. I will not do it again. I want to go home. Sister, which room is Mini Dewan in? - Mini Dewan..cabin number 29. - 29. 11..13.. I don't want to sleep. I am scared. Well, it's all your fault, Mini.. Mini. It's not her fault, It's not her fault. Say it's not her fault.. It's YOUR fault. She is only a six year old child.. Say it's not her fault. Mini.. Come on, let's get you out of here.. Grandma? She's gone to sleep. Do I have to sleep also? No no. As long as I am alive nothing will happen to you. Promise. You have grown.. I missed you. Everyone loves spelling? - Yeah. - And you're not scared of aunty? - No.. - Hi Daddy.. - Hi baby. - Please hurry. - Hi. - Get in. Hi Simran! - Hello Simran. - Hi Simran! - Bye aunty, Bye uncle. - Sister, hurry up. - Bye aunty, Bye uncle. - Bye. Bye Daddy. Where were you all night? Rashmi.. I'll drop her to school from tomorrow. Why? If you have so much time to spare, spend it with me. Not like that, yaar! You're not coming in? Coming. Listen.. I have to go to Kolkata.. Wow! And when I want to go you have thousand of excuses. Don't joke.There is something I need to do.. Something important? I don't know. I am trying to figure it out. "Gut feeling" again? Yes. But I am right this time.. I don't want to know. You and your gut feeling.. Good to see you have so much feeling for your husband.. Be thankful that I only have feelings for you.. Not like you. God only knows who all you have feelings for.. Let me find out.. - Listen ..I'm off. - Wait. You and your magic. Now go. What are you doing? You're not supposed to get up. - I need to leave.. - Jharna! Jharna! Please lie down What happened? Prepare a sedative. Quick. You lie back. Sister I.. What is going on here? What are you doing? I need to leave.. I have to go to Kolkata. Give me the sedative. Put her back in bed. - Slowly. - Oho. It has started bleeding. Slowly. Your stitches have come apart now.. I have to re-stitch them.. What happened to me? You have been in an accident. I am calling the police. - They will come and explain. - Police? Doctor please don't call the police.. please don't call the police.. Sir, you called? Yes. What was that drama yesterday about the diary and evidence book? Sir .. He first told me that diary is evidence from that accident case.. He has to record it. So I went and bought the exercise book. Then in front of you he said it's his wife's diary. I was very confused.. where did this wife come from? This is that Maity nursing home case? I think so, sir. Where is Inder? He came in the morning, then left. Wait I will call him. The number you are trying to reach is unavailable. Sir , inspector Singh's phone is coming switched off. Call the police station. See if Haldar is there. Yes sir. But why didn't you shift her? I had ordered Inder to shift her. That problem was solved. Inspector Singh offered to pay for her expenses. What!? Inder offered to pay? - Ramsingh.. - Yes Sir! Get my car out.. These new boys think they are too smart.. But I am smarter. - Definitely. - Move it. Quickly. Take. I am finding this very hard to believe, inspector.. Are you sure you are not confusing Bidya with someone else? Trust me, doctor.. Nobody is more surprised than I am. But it is true that Durga Rani Singh is a wanted criminal. She kidnapped Mini, and maybe.. ..responsible for the death of Mini's grandmother. - See this. - What? And this Durga.. Is Bidya? Yes. But.. if she is not her mother why would she go through all the trouble.. ..to cure Mini? I don't know, doctor. But I intend to find out. But now you are telling me they are fake passports. Absolutely. These are false names. How can they be fake? Visas were issued on these passports.. You have no idea how much talent we have in our country. "Here's come your love, my beloved" "Here's come your love, my beloved" You know Goopi? Uncle? You know where I can find Goopi? Uncle.. You know the man who makes these fake passports. HEY.. No police allowed here.. What do you want? I want Goopi. Where is he? Run, Goopi.. Thanks. Hey Goopi. Come on! Hey Goopi.. Now? Hey you! Hit him. Done? Now sit. Get up. - I haven't done anything wrong.. - Then why did you run? Why did you chase me? What? It's my fault now? You made these? My best work till date. Come. Normally one is enough but since you have a double role, I used two. Good Evening. Inspector Pranab Haldar. And what do I call you? Vidya Sinha or Durga Rani Singh? Water.. Water.. Malay.. call the nurse. Slowly..slowly. "From small story and from raining water, entire hilly areas get filled up." Why you smiling? Now we are definitely going back to Kolkata.. "..i feel low" Hello. - Listen. - Yes, sir. - Get my car out. - Sir. Sir please help me.. Please help me sir.. What? What? Please help me sir.. How can I help you? Please let me go. My daughter is missing.. I need to find her. I need to go to Kolkata..please sir. Ahh. Your daughter? You mean the girl you kidnapped? Whose grandmother you murdered? That same daughter? No sir, she is my daughter. My daughter sir.. You need to let me go.. please. OK. I will let you go. Explain to me how she is your daughter and I will let you go. Tell me.. I thought as much. Sir she is my daughter. Sir please let me go.. Please sir. Good evening sir. You have no right to keep me here.. Let me go.. Let me go to my daughter.. Sir. - Let me go to my daughter.. - You Come outside. Let me go to my daughter.. Please let me go.. Please let me go. Come on It's only a drama. I have seen this too many times with every criminal. You go and sit there. If anything ..Call me. - Yes sir, sir. - Ok? Come. Sir sir Singh sir.. Sir doctor Maity has left this.. Inspector Singh.. - What is it? - Sir doctor Maity.. Can you not see we are talking? Go inside. Inderjeet I have no option but to suspend you. Why sir? How stupid do you think I am? - Sir, I was going to.. - No no.. I know you are desperate for a promotion.. But that doesn't mean you circumvent me and keep me in the dark. - Sir I.. - You knew this was.. the same Durga Rani but you didn't tell me.. Because you wanted to take all the credit. You wanted to be the hero. Even though I am the one who told you she is a wanted criminal. Sir, you got it all wrong. What? Sir I was just trying to confirm it.. ..and only when it was confirmed I was going to come to you. What confirmation? Sir, when you told me, I was not sure if it was the same woman. I got a lead to a doctor Sen in Kolkata. I went and found out that she is the same Durga Rani Singh. She is.. Sir she was planning to leave the country using false documents.. This woman? Rubbish. Not possible. See this. Proof. For you sir. What the.. What a dangerous woman! I don't believe.. Anyway.. Tomorrow we take her back to Kolkata and hand her over. Sir after we catch her.. My promotion is guaranteed, right? Let's do our work. Promotion will come. Excuse me sir? - What is it? - Sir doctor Maity gave this for you. What is this? Sir you see. What is this? The bill for Bed 21. That accident case. The doctor got it wrong.. What I told him was I will take care if it is more than two days.. Doesn't matter.. Take this back.. I will talk to him. Sir, you only give it back to him.. Or he will shout at me. Areh.. is this a joke or what? How can you give me a bill of 65000 rupees like this? You should have at least called me before making this bill. I tried calling you, sir.. Your phone was off. I even called your house.. You did WHAT? Sir you only said to call home if your mobile was off.. The number you are trying to reach is currenty not available. Where is daddy? I don't know. Is that daddy's diary? I don't know. Rascal, Maity. Hey! You scared me.. I heard your bike. You're not coming up? I was just about to come up. You started smoking again? Cigarette? I quit long back. You promised you'll quit.. I did. I have. Look.. just once in a while. But why didn't you tell me? Rashmi, I don't smoke regularly.. Once in a while.. If I told you.. You would get worried for no reason. So you hid it from me? Yes. What else have you hidden from me? You read the diary? NO. Why would I read someone else's diary? You are my husband. You tell me. You both need to be quiet. Because in case the constable outside wakes up.. - I'll have to put him to sleep. - You? Where is Mini? - What? - Where is Mini? Where is my daughter? Daughter? Yes. Definitely looks like you.. She is waiting for you to come and save her. Please let her go. I am begging you. How do I let her go Durga? In my whole career, only you two escaped from me. And when I take money for work. I always finish it. Even if it takes eight years. Anyway .. I need 'you' to kill Mini. What? What do you mean? She is your daughter no? Because as a mother you will obviously want the best for your child. Yes? Please.. You want to given her a peaceful death or a painful one.. So if you reach by tomorrow evening.. You can kill her yourself.. In a peaceful way. Like this. BUT IF YOU don't, then.. Tomorrow. 5 p.m. Be there. Does anyone else know that she is your ex-wife? No, no one. It was hardly a marriage, Rashmi. Even I didn't remember Durga till I saw her again.. Do you believe her story? I don't know.. But why would someone write lies in their diary? And the other kidnapping and murder story? My gut feeling says that Durga is not like that. The last time you had a gut feeling we ended up in Chandan Nagar.. I'm a Policeman, Rashmi. I've stayed two years with her.. She was my wife. Rashmi? Why are you crying? Should I be worried? Durga was my wife. You are my wife now. Then don't do anything that will affect our daughter. Never. Even if I wanted to I can't. Tomorrow she will be handed over to Kalimpong police and end of story. I need to tell you something.. Yes sir. What? Coming. Durga has escaped from the nursing home.. Hey? Do you want to marry me? How could you let her escape? But, sir.. she said she wanted to go to the toilet.. And also that woman died.. In that confusion.. In that confusion.. What happened? She passed away in her sleep. Look at him? Did I ask you to watch this woman? Then why did you not stay with Durga? - But how can I go to ladies toilet? - Shut up! She should not go out of Chandan Nagar.. Yes sir! Sir I know where she lives. Let's go. Benu uncle..Benu uncle. Who? Bidya? - What happened? - Nothing. Uncle, I need my keys. Yes. I'll get them. Sir this one. This one? This is locked. Who's upstairs? Benu uncle.. He has a spare key. Should I check the back? Yes check. I'll get the keys. So many stairs! I need the keys for Vidya's house.. - She was here just a minute ago.. - Leave me. - Sir I caught her. - Leave me. Got her. Leave. Leave it. Hey! You.. Inder! Inder.. Inder.. Inder.. Inder.. Inderjeet Singh? Inside. Okay, sign here. Yes. Check the river front. - Why don't you understand? - Inder? - Inder.. - Rashmi.. What happened? Nothing. Just a flesh wound. He got shot. Hello.. Haldar. - Yes speak up. - You got shot? Yes.. but no harm done.. Just a flesh wound. Who shot you? - I'll meet you straight on checkpost. - No one. What do you mean 'no one'? One dangerous criminal Durga Rani Singh.. Inder had a narrow escape.. Four inches this side and goodbye. The woman whose hospital bills you were going to pay.. she shot you? No no Inder did that to keep her here.. We can watch her.. She doesn't escape. Rashmi? Rashmi, wait.. Rashmi .. Listen. What happened? It's my job, Rashmi.. - No, it's NOT. - Shhhh. Had you told everyone the truth the first day.. This wouldn't have happened. Rashmi.. the bullet hardly touched me. I am okay.. Nothing happened. - You said I had nothing to worry about. - You don't. but you are still defending her! What if it hit you four inches this side? What if something happened to you? Did you even once think of Simran or the baby? Baby? What? Are you pregnant?.. Rashmi is this a way to give such news? Inder? Sir, no one since I have been here.. When did the last train leave? The last train left long back.. She is not here. - Anything? - No sir, Okay. Sir, I think she has left for Kolkata. I have the same feeling. Your men came all the way from Chandan Nagar.. to tell us that they found this woman.. and then lost her? Looks like it. Sir if I'm not mistaken.. ..this Chandan Nagar is just about the size of a football ground. How can she escape from there? How? Excuse me, Ma'am.. What are you doing here? I am looking for the exit. Come with me, Ma'am. I'll show you where it is. I don't understand why this woman would come to Kolkata from Kalimpong? If she wanted to escape, she would have run far away! Why come to a place so close? Only a week back we found new information.. that she was once married to someone in Kolkata. Maybe to meet or seek help from him. Who? We haven't found that out.. Yet. We must find him.. He might be our only lead to this Durga Rani.. Oh sorry, sorry sir.. Say quick.. I'm at Lalbazar.. Yes.. I'm fine.. Wait. I will call you in an hour. Sorry.. my wife.. She's been worried ever since I got shot. Anyway.. Let's get back to work. Let's find this Durga Rani Singh.. Also let's find this husband of hers. Inder you find out that husband. Account close Ma'am? Yes. Dock number 15? - It's straight. - Okay. Mini? Mini..? Mini.. Mamma.. Mamma.. Mamma.. - Mini.. - Mamma - Mini.. - Mamma Mini.. Mamma! - Mini.. - Mamma! Mini..? Mamma! - Are you okay? - What happened to you? Nothing - Are you okay? Have they hurt you? Please take me home. Yes we will. Now that I'm here.. Please let her go. Both of you are going to the same place. Why are you doing this? This is what I do for a living.. I get paid to do this. You can't get away with murder.. Why not, Durga? You did, didn't you? Very important, very important.. - Hey, Inderjeet.. - Sir. We have a lead.. All marriage records have been recently computerised.. We'll find the husband's name from the database. - Good news huh? - Yes sir. I'll tell the comissioner. See you. Goopi? Durga. Don't worry it's clean. Just run it across her wrists for me. I won't do it. What choices do you have? - Take it. - Even if I let you go.. The police will put you in jail.. And send back Mini to her house.. To me! And THAT will be a very painful death. - Careful.. - No no.. I am unarmed.. I will pay you all this.. Money that I have saved for Mini's treatment.. If you kill him. Oh? A twist in the tale? Stop this nonsense and just kill her. At least you kill for money.. You have some principles.. They kill people for no reason. KILL HIM.. I will give you all my money and You can kill me too. - Kill her.. - Just let my daughter go. Kill her.. How much money do you have? Talk talk talk.. I was paying you to do a job, not to have a chat. Mamma.. Mamma.. Mamma.. Mini. Inder! Right? How are you Inder? - What's up man? - Oh Pawan? How are you? You looking fit Meet my colleague. - Biren. - Oh hi Inder, nice to meet you. - Where were you? - Haldar sir! Meeting up with some old friends.. We have to go. - Take care. Same here. - All the best. Good to see you. Inder is an idiot.. Screwed up his promotion.. Else he'd be here with us. You called your wife? It's almost an hour.. - I forgot. - Sir! Sir.. SIr one Durga Rani Singh wants to speak to you.. With me!? Yes sir. On the main line. Let's go, Let's go. Come on. Hello? Is this Inderjeet Singh? Yes. Are you alone? Yes. But how did you know where to find me? I came in your car to Kolkata. What do you want? I need your help. For what? To save my daughter. Please help me to save my daughter. Durga..

Don't hang up. Look you don't even have to come to station. If you trust me.. You go to this address.. I will meet you there.. Alone. Inder why did Durga call you? I have no idea but I am glad she did. I have to pay her back for shooting me.. What place is this? My parents old house. No one is staying there now. - Sir. - Yes.
