Captioning made possible by new line home video Agnes: nurses came from all over the United States as well, and I was one of them and as eager for adventure as the college boys who volunteered. I didn't know it at the time, but the choices I made in northern Italy that summer would affect the rest of my life. [Parade music] [Cheering] [Klaxon horn honking] May I? Thanks, Harry. You're a great driver. Anytime. Allow me. Thanks, Harry. Whew. I'm sorry about the bumpy road there, miss Von kurowsky. Oh, Harry, I'm sure in time my derriere will learn to forgive you. Posso? Oh, si, grazie. Prego. Oh. Don't forget about our date for ice cream. Well, you know where I am. We're here to do a job, remember? [Speaking Italian] Boy: la signora a un Angelo? Buon giorno. Sei un Angelo? He thinks you angel from heaven. Well, tell him we're just nurses arrived from America. Mac? Yeah? I have to find the bathroom. Grazie. grazie. Come along, girls, it's time we were finding our quarters. De long: This is where we will live and work. I don't know. Looks more like a nunnery to me. Very observant, miss MacDonald. That's exactly what it was and exactly how it will stay. Now, if you will all follow me, let it be clearly understood that any nurse caught fraternizing with the patients will be sent home immediately. You have no idea. What? You have to stand with your legs like this. How do they expect you to make it from that sort of distance? [Giggling] [Officer counting out march] They look great, don't they? Look at it this way: We sure won't have to worry about spending our huge paychecks 'cause there ain't no place to spend 'em. I thought we were gonna be in some sort of city. Looks like anyone under 50 is just passing through. We go where we're sent, Rosie. I'm just glad we're so close to the front. Oh, not close enough for me. Yeah, well, if the Italians get pushed back again, ag, you'll soon have your wish. Buona sera, signorine. Benvenute nella nostra piccole cittadine. The language is definitely gonna be a problem here. But these Italian gents sure are gallant, aren't they? Even the old coots. Do you know what I read once? That Italian men respect their wives. They spoil their mistresses. Aggie. But the only women they ever really love are their mamas. [Laughter] [Men screaming] Man: mama! [Men yelling] Man: attacco! [Gunshots] [Machine gun fire] Attacco! Man: help me. Help me, someone. [Groaning] help... [Moaning] [Whistlithe caissons go rolling along] ♪ Over hill ♪ ♪ over Dale ♪ ♪ as we hit the dusty trail ♪ ♪ and those caissons go rolling along ♪ Hi, Jimmy! Jimmy: hey, hey, Ernie! Where's birdseed? Burnside. he's in there. But you really shouldn't-- I didn't come all this way to wait tables behind the lines. Not why I signed up. Don't know about you. Oh, I don't know. Always play the hand you're dealt. That's my motto. Yeah, well, remind me to look you up when I want a good game of old maid. Watch this. Sir, lieutenant Ernest Hemingway requesting a change of assignment. I wasn't aware lieutenant Hemingway reported for duty yet. Sir, lieutenant Hemingway reporting for duty and requesting a change of assignment. Jimmy: Ernie... The answer's no. Shall we? Italian officer: I am grateful for your assistance. Burnside: that's why we're here, sir. Grazie. ci vediamo domani. Thanks again for coming over. Arrivederci. Now, young man, if I were you, I'd put on an apron and start serving some coffee. You can't do this to me. I've come all the way from the states. Do you know what they're saying in the papers? This is the war to end all wars. If I don't see action now, it'll be too late. This is my last chance. Let me explain something to you, Hemingway. If the American red cross were interested in you as a fighting man, they would have issued you a rifle, is that not so? Yes, sir, but-- but they didn't do that, did they? Well, no, sir-- and your job is to help the morale of our weary Italian allies. A simple cup of coffee. A cigarette. A candy bar. A few words of encouragement. Yes, sir, I understand. You are dead right, sir. Simple cup of coffee, some candy, a pack of smokes. I see now they're symbols of support and encouragement that carry the spirit of America to our war-weary allies in Italy. And where are our comrades the most weary? Well, in the front line, right, sir? In the trenches, right, sir? You're wrong, Jimmy. Birdseed's not nearly the horse's ass you said he was. I'll get my bag, sir. See you, Jimmy. McBride. [Explosions in the distance] [Explosions grow louder] [Speaking Italian] Ernest: buona sera. Buona sera. Does, uh...Anyone-- any of you speak inglese? English? Un poco. Ernie Hemingway. Newspaper reporter from Kansas City. Voui un caffe? No. no, thank you. Enrico biscaglia. I am a waiter from bordighera. Here you go. Cigarette? How long you been here? Francesco, me, we 2 months. Roberto due, tre settimane. 2, 3 weeks. Could you please... Ask Roberto "could i see his rifle?" Mostra il tuo fucile al giornalista americano. [Explosions outside] Avanti. faglielo verdere. [Locks safety] That's a peach. E' una pesca. Roberto: una pesca? E quelio che ha detto. It's a peach. Cosa credi che non sappia come si dice pesca? Questa... Non e una pesca. E' un fucile. Capito? fucile. Fucile. Enrico: he tell you "rifle." Fucile. Ah, si, fucile. [Explosions outside] The, uh, Austrians-- through there? Enrico: eh, si, si. On the other side of the Ridge. [Making gun noises] Grazie. You, uh, arditi, right? Si, arditi. We are the best. Ardiis the best. Salute. enrico, voi restate qui? Si, si. Andate. Venite, ragazzi. Andiamo! Siamo pronti. What do you fellas think about while you're waiting? I think of rosaries-- how many I have to say if god let me live. Roberto... He think of women all the time. That's because he's not had one yet. No damas? No, no uno? No uno. And you, bambino americano? Plenty. Mucho damas. Many women. Enrico: dice bugie, eh? I think you tell lies. [Loud explosion] Enrico: why you not a soldier? Tried my damnedest, but they wouldn't take me. Enrico: "damnedest"? Uh, no possibile. Not possible. Why, too young? Man: ragazzi, siete pronti? Abbiamo un minute al... L'emetto. No--no, i--i--i lied about my age. It's my left eye. My left eye, it's no good. It, uh--too much boxing. Uh, l'esercito non se lo pigliava perche a guercio dall'occhio sinistro. Meglio l'occhio sinistro che il coglione sinistro. [Men laughing] Roberto say better your left eye... Than your left ball. [Artillery shell whistling] Ah. [Coughs] Oh. Aah. [Coughing] Oh, god. Aah! Aah. Oh. Roberto: aiuto. Roberto. Roberto: aiuto. Roberto. Roberto. Oh, god. [Grunting] Aah. Ok. [Flares hiss] [Machine gun fire] Aah! [Speaking Italian] Uhh. [Cloth ripping] Uhh. [Speaking Italian] [Groaning] Uhh! Aah! Uhh! That say... Does that say I'm gonna live, or does it say I'm gonna die? Bambino americano. Roberto. Si e buono. Good. Hey, I'm fine. I'm fine. Help him. He's never even been with a woman. Calma. Damn it! You bastards! Don't let him die! We go to him. Is everybody here? Yes, miss de long. Apparently, it's not a major emergency, after all, so we won't need extra people on the morning shift. But we will have several casualties within the hour, so you all know the routine. Come on downstairs. All right. You're with me. [Klaxon honking] [Honk] Come on, come on. Nurse: take it easy. Piano, piano. De long: We'll put him in number 8. Otto. And this one in number 9, miss Rose. Skip: this last one must be crazy. Carried one of the arditi wounded right through a bombardment. Yes, ma'am? In that case-- uh, miss Cavanaugh? We'll put him at the far end, where it's quieter. In 17. Yes, ma'am. Diciasette. Ho capito, signora. Do you know what happened? It's a bad leg wound. He got it on the piave front. Lift. Anything you need? I'll need, uh, more saline solution. Hey, kid. Am I dying? Oh, eventually, but not in the immediate future. You lying to me? Mm-mm. You promise? Promise. I love you. Will you marry me? How we feeling? What's wrong? Hmm? nothing. Mac, would you come over here for a minute? Some-something's the matter. What is it? Well? Like I said, kid, nothing's wrong. I'm just giving bed 8 a drink. Yeah, but what's going on? I'll be back in a minute. Gangrene? Maybe. Can we get a doctor? Not until tomorrow. It might be too late by then. I can't help it. Miss de long said the only doctor the Italians could spare wouldn't be here till tomorrow. Hmm, hmm. You know, the only thing to do is irrigate the wound with daken's. No. you cannot do something like that without a doctor's order. Mac, we can't wait for a doctor's order. Aggie, something like that could get you shipped back to the states. Fine. I won't be doing the splits when I go to the bathroom. Ag! Good afternoon, doctor. I've been assigned as your surgical assistant. Major caracciolo. Agnes Von kurowsky. Ah, yes, Hemingway. Shrapnel everywhere. Some quite deep. Come, come. Bullet behind the patella. Did you see any pieces of-- come si dice? Uh, uniform. Oh, yes, thank you. Uniform. Did you see any uniform in the wound? Unfortunately, yes. And when I was changing the dressing last night and then again this morning, there was a definite odor. Gangrene. So if it is, I will have to amputate. I will operate on this side with a nurse, you, on my left. You do not approve of an amputation? I think he is very young to lose a leg. Ecco. You see? I was right. And how do you propose that we shall not have to amputate this young boy's leg? Well, in America, we've had some success with a treatment that was developed at Johns Hopkins hospital, so I've been irrigating the wound-- I know everything about this notion of irrigating. Who is this John Hopkins of the hospital? Is he a Saint? It's Johns Hopkins, and, no, it's not named after a Saint. Then it cannot be much of a hospital, can it? Well, I will operate tomorrow in the morning. Please have the patient ready at 8:30. And, nurse... Perhaps you would like my permission for your irrigation treatment. Beautiful girl with a Martini. I must have died and gone to heaven. Gin and castor oil. Sorry about that. Ohh. What do you know? I graduated the same year. Mm-hmm. me from nursing school, you from kindergarten? My mother told me never ask a lady about her age or her teeth. Mmm. 26, and they're all mine. What's going on? I'm going to irrigate the wound again. Relax. relax. Mmm! Gangrene? Now, how do you know about gangrene? My old man's a doctor. And after the war, you're going to medical school. Not a chance. I'm a reporter. A reporter? How old are you? 22. Kid, I hope you're a better reporter than you are a liar. Relax. Am I going to lose my leg? I'm asking you, please. I'm really not permitted to talk about your condition. You...you'll have to speak with the surgeon. Surgeon? If I'm going to end up being less than all of me... I'd rather be dead. Kid, I'm going to do everything I can to help you keep your leg. But you're going to have to work with me. I'm going to keep on washing out this wound with daken's acid every hour on the hour. You'll be up and dancing in no time. I'm not a very good dancer. Big feet and no rhythm. [Chuckles] Well, I am. I love to dance. I'll teach you and get you good and ready for the girls back home. [Liquid squirting] Uno, due, tre. Ernest: Rosie? Don't put me under yet. Where's Agnes? She's right here. Jesus, I'm scared. You and me, partner. Good morning, young man. Morning, doc. You gotta promise me one thing. Save the bullet for me. Yes, of course. [Gas hissing] Agnes: breathe deeply. Hmm. Well... I do not smell the odor you spoke about yesterday, but it would...Still be safest to amputate now. I'm sorry. Being safe is not important to him, doctor. He wants to keep his leg. Ahem. Jill, the larger sponges, please. Thank you. As I'm sure you know, second operations are a great luxury in time of war. Yes, of course. But one could say, what is life without its little luxuries? Refractor and long forceps. Holy cow, he's good-looking. Yeah... But young. I meant Dr. caracciolo. Caracciolo: miss Von kurowsky? Perhaps one day you will permit me to show you something of our countryside... When you will be off duty. I think I hate you. Mmm. Everything is fine. You're going to keep your leg. Sleep. I don't want to dance with the girls back home. Bed 8's an interesting case. Thought yesterday there might be some peripheral vision in the left eye. It's still early, of course. [Sighs] Are they always just cases to you, Mac? It's the only way to cope. You should know that as well as I do. Well, I do know it with one part of my brain, but sometimes... Sometimes they get to you. Especially when they're good-looking boys with the charm of the devil, and you've broken all the rules to make sure they walk out of here on both legs. But just remember... We're here to do a job. We're here to do a job. For god's sake, be careful. [Klaxon honks] [Honk] De long: Villard in 15, quindici. Kenyon in 13, tredici. [Whistlithe caissons go rolling along] De long: Mr. McBride in 6 needs immediate attention. We're short of doctors, but I've telephoned already. This is villard, Henry s., in 15? Yes, miss de long. Harry villard? Hey, you Harvard yard bastard, how the hell are you? Mr. Hemingway, I will not tolerate that kind of language on my ward. Harry: if that's Ernest Hemingway, ma'am, bad language is the least of your problems. He's got chronic diarrhea of the mouth. Mr. villard! What are you in here for, Harry? Well, whatever it is, these gals will have you back in the pink in no time. Uh, maybe not. At least yellow's more becoming than that cute-- de long: Jaundice is no laughing matter, and if you bother Mr. villard, I'll have you moved. We call her gumshoe. I see you were hit. Yeah. Where were you? On the piave. You? I was at grappa. Was it bad? Bad. Me, too. Is there a nurse Von kurowsky still here? Agnes? I'll let you down fast, old sport. She's spoken for. Oh, no. I--i saw her first. I drove her here. For which we are truly thankful. Anyway, she needs a real man. Why is precisely why she would never go for a conceited windbag like yourself. Man: no! Please! Don't! ohh! Jesus, what happened to him? Hit by a phosphorous shell handing out candy bars at the piave canteen. Man: aah! Aah! Jesus Christ! Jimmy? Man: aah! Aah! We were there together. De long: Still! Keep still, son! Man: aah! What is it? What is it? De long: We'll leave the dressing until we give you something for the pain. Burton: what's happening to him? Jimmy, it's Ernie. Ernie. You're gonna be all right. You understand? I promise you. You'll be fine. [Jimmy whimpers] Buona sera. Per lei. Grazie. [Footsteps running past] You really shouldn't be in here, kid. Ernie. my name's Ernie. Whatever you say... Kid. "To Dr. James Paxton, bellevue hospital." "Dr. James Paxton, bellevue hospital." And I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that those might be personal? Last night, a bunch of us were talking about why we came here. And I said that I came here because I was looking for something. Hmm. I'm not sure what it is... But I know I'll find it here. Somewhere about 6 miles from here in the trenches, that's where it is. It never occurred to me until now that it might be possible to come here looking to get away from something. Touchá. It's no use him writing you, you know. Hmm. 'Cause you're in love with me. Oh. ha ha ha. I am, am I? Mmm. yeah. You just don't know it yet. Will you get out of here, kid? Please? Good morning, miss Agnes. Good morning. Ag. May I present you my adjutant, tenente alberti? He will be our chaperon. [Speaking Italian] Look at him. He's good-looking. He's Italian. He's a doctor. It's all over for us. It'll never work. Take another look. He's ancient. He's got to be close to 40. Maybe more. No wonder he wanted to chop off my leg. He might not have stopped there. Caracciolo: Von kurowsky? My father's very proud of that "Von." He's from konigsberg, Germany. So you are... Come si dice? First generation? On my father's side. My mother's American. And now you are nursing young Americans in Italy, where Austrians and Germans are... Fighting against us. The red cross doesn't take sides. That's one of the reasons I joined. And, uh, the others? Someone else asked me that just yesterday. I hoped to be assigned to one of the surgical teams operating on the front. Me, too. Sorry, Harry. Thank you. Thanks, partner. What's her name? Harry: Emilia. Emilia, scusi, scusi. Uh, per favore, uh, can you get us some--some alcohol? Some Brandy? Some bran-Brandy? Brandy? Acqua? No, no, no, Brandy, Brandy. The--you know, in a bottle? Ah, latte. No, no, no, Brandy. Come on, Brandy. Ah... Yes, Brandy. No. mi dispiace ma non á possibile. Emilia. oh, Emilia, Emilia, Emilia. No, Emilia? Scusi, scusi, scusi. See, Emilia, my leg... It's very sick, my leg. Very sick. You need to help me. 'Cause my mom isn't here, see? And--and you need to be my mama. Mama. mama, huh? No. Very sore. It's very sore. Va bene. Va bene. Va bene. Grazie. Grazie, Emilia. Got her. Emilia. I think she likes me. Ha ha ha ha. Ah, come on, Harry. You know what they say about nurses. Why--why don't you just shut up, you bunch of drunks? They're always seeing us naked, washing our private parts for us. It's bound to affect them. Especially my private part. You're way out of line, kenyon. I--i don't know if it affects them, but when i first got here, um, one of them, of course I don't know which one-- is there anybody drinking here? Here. Anyway, she was down there, um, sudsing me up, and it was pretty damn embarrassing. All our nurses seem like nice girls to me. Except maybe Rosie. Larkin: thank god. [Laughter] Larkin: whose bet is it? Well, gentlemen, have we all moved our bowels today? Mr. Larkin? 8:32, ma'am. Good. mmm? 8:33, ma'am. Mm-hmm. 8:34, ma'am. Now that we're all so regular, do you think we could have our cocktails tonight without the usual glob at the bottom? There will be no cocktails this evening, gentlemen. Period. It worked. Playing cards, gentlemen, or what? Raise you 2 bits, gentlemen. Call. Jimmy calls. It's big trouble. I fold. Ernie... Remember what I said... Back at the canteen? I always play the cards I'm dealt. Larkin: what are you doing, villard? Thinking. I don't... Think I can... Play this hand. Sure, you can. Three 4s. Three 9s. Ernie? Larkin: Ernie? I folded. That's, uh, 2 bucks to me, then. Wait a minute, wait. McBride called. Straight, queen high. Don't trust you, hem. You trust me, don't you, Joseph? Mmm... Straight, queen of hearts high. All right, boys, why don't we let Jimmy get some rest? Mac: yeah, that's better. Not so fast. Good. Time for lunch, Mac. I'll take over. Thanks. Mac: hey, kid, take it easy. It's not a race. Why does everybody keep calling me kid? Why, indeed? I'll be back in a half an hour. All right. Well, look at you. How we doing? Pretty good. Very impressive. Let me try with one. By all means. Whoa, easy. You have no Patience. Slowly. See? Who's that fella in New York, keeps writing you all those letters? It's this way. Well, he's... None of your business. What about caracciolo? You got to be careful about him. You know, he's old enough to be your father. Ahem. He's also none of your business. All right... But I meant everything i said the other night. Let's turn around. Slowly. Kid, you say a lot of things. I have trouble keeping track of all of them. About you being in love with me. Oh. Only not knowing it. Right. Well, what about you? I mean, I would really hate to be the only one in love here. Oh, I love you all right. Nobody will ever love anybody as much as I love you. Ernest... Agnes: just a little bit. Just... [Patient coughing] Come on. Just a little bit. Just a little bit. Here you go. Jimmy, please. Just a little bit. You have to eat something. If you don't, Jimmy, you won't make it. Please. Burnside: uh, atta boy, Ernie. Just, uh-- let me just, uh-- there. now, remember to say cheese. There you go. "I give this silver medal..." "For your courage action "on the piave river on the 8th day of July..." "1918. "When you are much wounded, "you... "Ernest Hemingway, "carried private Roberto zardini, "also much wounded, behind the lines..." "And you do not accept medical attention until private zardini is attended to first." Uh, yes, now, for this, could we-- uh, Ernie, could you just come up here a bit, and, you...Just turn. Ah, yes, uh, good, good. We'll--we'll do that in just a minute. Let's just get this first, and, uh-- yes, in closer. Good, yes. Ah, let's get one with all the young gentlemen. Now, just over against this wall. If we-- Ernie, will you just, uh-- over here in the center. And, yes, uh, nurse, could you join him, please? Right here. That--that's fine. If you'd rather be there, that's ok. And our--please. And can we see heads through there? Stand up in the back there, gentlemen. There you go. I suppose congratulations are in order. Thanks. Caracciolo: your American troops are to join us soon... And there will be a big push. And I must leave tomorrow to set up a forward surgical unit. I was hoping... We could have another drive together before I go. I'm sorry. I promised two of the patients that I would take them on a small excursion. Young Hemingway? Maybe some other time. I would like that. [Counting quietly] Can I talk to you? Uhh. I've lost count. It's Harry. I'm worried about him. What is it? He's a lot sicker than he's letting on. Oh, he is, is he? Yeah. 1, 2, 3, 4... In fact, I don't think anybody realizes just... How sick the poor fellow really is. And you do? Mmm. E-Ernie, don't-- please don't do that. Sorry. i just wanted to see what it was made of. Is it some kind of cotton? It's a chambray. It must get warm in the heat. It does. 1, 2... The thing I was thinking is that... It might not be such a good idea for him to come on the picnic with us. Ernie, please. What are these, silk? Cotton--cotton. Ahem. Anyways, I was--i was thinking that if Harry stayed here... And we went on without him, that... He might be disappointed for a while, but, I think, in the end, it'd be best. You do have his best interests at heart. Believe me, I do. Shall I tell him, or will you? Oh, i--i think... Maybe you should-- you should leave that up to me. What's the matter, Ernie? Cat got your tongue? Andiamo. Driver: su. Teresa: fermo! Fermo, per favore! E' mio zio. Questo e mio zio, il padre di Roberto zardini. Vorrebbe dare al signor Ernie la mantella di suo figlio. Ernie, it's Roberto zardini's father, and--and that is Roberto's cape. Mia moglie ed io-- he wants me to have it? Mm-hmm. Mia moglie ed io la ringraziamo per quello che ha fatto. Thank you, signor zardini. Grazie. Please ask her if... Uh--uh... Roberto... Lui... E' morto. Di-- di a tuo... Uh... Your uncle that... Signor Ernie á, um, molto... Ernest: grazie. H-honored... Di--di ricevere... Uh... La mantella... Di suo figlio. E' molto onorato. Grazie. There's a hundred tiny little fish down here nibbling on my legs. Lucky bastards. If this was walloon lake, they'd be bass, and I'd have reeled in 6 of them by now. Agnes: walloon? It's in Michigan. Someday, I'll take you there. I'll catch 'em. You'll clean 'em. We'll both eat 'em. The day I clean a bass will be the day a one-legged, big-headed boy swims himself across this lake. Right. Harry: Ernie. Ernie. Ernie! Ernie! Ernest. Ernie. Ernie! Can you swim? I hope not. Ernie, you-- [Ernest gasping for breath] Come on, Ernie-- ok, fine! I'll clean--I'll clean-- I'll clean one fish. Ernie? Two!? Fine, Ernie. Ok, you win, Ernie. I'll clean all 6 stupid fish. How many? What? How many? 6... Fish. All right. [Ernest and Agnes laugh] "I have a rendezvous with death at some disputed barricade. When spring comes back with rustling--" et cetera, et cetera, ad nauseam. "I shall not fail that rendezvous." For god's sakes, Ernie, every-- every freshman at Harvard has that one memorized. I can't imagine what's sticking in your craw. Come on, you two. You're both getting on my nerves. Harry: now, are you going to prance around all afternoon in a dead man's cape like some third-rate shakespearean actor? Pardon me, old man, but I carried him across the damn battlefield on my back. And every time you tell the story, it gets bigger and bigger. First, it was 20 yards, and then 50, and now it's the whole battlefield? I'm leaving if this does not stop. Too bad, Harry. It must have been tough for you these last few weeks. The rest of us shot up or, at least, injured, and you in the hospital because you turned yellow. Ernie, that was a stupid and thoughtless thing to say. Whose side are you on, anyway? Whoever will put an end to this ridiculous argument. I will, Agnes, but just for you. Are you going to ride back with us peacefully? I'd rather walk. Walk, then. Come on, Harry. Well, Ernie, it looks as though the best man has been granted the lady's favor after all. Oh, you're right, Harry, and it was granted to me the other night... In her bed. All right, girls, lift it up. De long: We're trying to get it straight, Rosie. Man: congratulate, Ernie! Congratulate, Ernie! [Distant artillery fire] Caracciolo: we have to keep...Quiet. American surgeon: He's good. And, uh, I'll come back-- who knows... Agnes, quietly: I think so. [Hoarsely] i hope... I--i can't hear you. I hope... I hope? I hope... Everyone... Is... All right... There. There? there. [Distant klaxon horn] Jimmy, I'm terribly sorry. The other-- I'm afraid the other patients have arrived, so I'm going to have to leave. Jimmy: you... Will... Send it... Won't you? I promise. I'll be back as soon as I can. We're getting more than we thought. Go get the doctor. We'll be using all the beds. We need wheelchairs. Nurse: yes, miss de long. Listen, I need to talk. Kid, this is not the time. I've been such an idiot. It's over, isn't it, you and me? I made a mess out of it, and now you're never going to forgive me. Let's move the patients into bed carefully but quickly, everyone, and get these stretchers out of here. Burton: nurse? All right, son. What is it, Burton? Bathroom. I'll take you. De long: Put the amputee in bed 22. I want the doctor to see him first. And the head wound in 20-- be sure to keep him covered... [Bottles clatter] Oh, dio santo. Aiuto! Aiuto, a morto! Dead! Jimmy dead! Agnes: kid, go away. What's that? It's the letter that Jimmy was dictating. "Dear mom and dad, "thanks for the package. "The weather here is hot, "but maybe it will cool down soon. "The food is good. "Everyone is all right here. I hope everyone is all right there." I was trying to think of how to finish it. Ernie. Dear mom and dad-- start over again. Ernest: dear mom and dad... The thing this war has taught me... Is that it's important to get things said before it's too late. First... You've been the very best parents a son could ever ask for. When I was a kid... And I used to get scared of the dark, it was the thought that you were there that got me through it. I think about that a lot... Because I guess I'm scared now. I don't know if I can make it... And if I don't... Please understand that sometimes... I have to go to places alone. But whatever happens... Always know that... I will be your loving son... Jimmy. I love you. [Knock on door] Mac: aggie, gumshoe's on her rounds. Harry, we're leaving. Agnes is looking for you. All right. Hey, have you seen Ernie? No. Harry. Harry. Thank--thank god I've found you. They're moving some of us closer to the front. I need for you to do me a huge favor. Anything. Mac: ag, come on. I'll be--I'll be right there. I can't find Ernie anywhere, and... Could you give this to him for me? I'm sorry, Harry. I--i... I honestly never expected anything like this to happen. Ag, we're leaving. You won't forget? I won't forget. Bye. Harry: Ernie! Listen, old man, I'm glad to run into you with no one else around. There's something I'd like to get off my chest. That business i said the other day about Agnes and me was... Well, it was all bull. Yeah. Ahem. Well, uh... She--she asked me to give this to you. Orders came through, and, uh... They sent her... [Opens envelope] I'm sorry, Ernie. I know how you feel. Agnes: dearest Ernie, new orders came through, and, suddenly, I find myself on my way to the front. I'm writing this with a shaky hand, partly because i am afraid and partly because it is so hard to say good-bye. I wanted to say this to you in person... [Klaxon horns honking] [Bugle blows reveille] Agnes: I'm on duty. Just read your letter. Ernest: dearest aggie, I miss and yearn to see you more than words can say. Every time someone comes through the door, I can't help but look up and hope it's you. I wear the ring you gave me and look at it maybe a hundred times a day. Harry has new orders to report to your sector, but the red cross medics took one look at my leg and turned me down. I may surprise them yet. Calma, sei in buone mani. Doctor: I need more ether! Nurse, hurry! Second doctor: Stop what you're doing and wait. Right, nurse, ether. Coming through. Coming through. He's coming around. Doctor: hold him down! Get those swabs-- sister, quickly! Doctor: hurry! If I had known it was going to be so... I wouldn't have asked them to assign you here. Doctor: cut for me, please. This is what i was trained for. You have been up almost 24 hours. So have you. Doctor: and again. Man: I've got to get it! You are such a child. This was a stupid thing to do. When are you going to grow up? I couldn't leave without seeing you again. Leave? I'm on orders back to the states. When? I got to catch a train tomorrow morning at 5:30. Mac: they've called us, ag. Mm-hmm. I came to tell you that I love you. And I will love you forever. There's a hotel by the train station. Kid, that's not a hotel. That's a brothel. There's nowhere else. I've asked around. Will you... I'll try. [People laughing] [Accordion plays romantic air] [Hinge creaks] I'm sorry. I didn't think it was going to be this bad. It's just... Part of war. Men desperate for sex, women desperate for...Money. You shouldn't be here. Let's go somewhere else, anywhere. [Closes door] It wasn't supposed to be like this. Never mind. We were going to be in the most beautiful place on god's earth. Then close your eyes. I told you I wasn't a very good dancer. To me, this is the most beautiful waltz in the world. This isn't a waltz. Even I know that. You'll write me, right? I'll write you every day. Be careful. I will. [Whistle blows] Promise? yes. [Train whistle blowing] I love you, Mrs. kid. When this is over, we'll get married, right? Right. Mr. and Mrs. kid. Tell me you love me. I need to hear you say it. Tell me. [Drowned out by noise] I love you. Say it. [Quietly] i love you. Well, that's-- that's terrific news. Maybe--maybe he and I have had our differences, but he's all right. I hate to admit it, but he's more than all right. You'll do him a world of good. What's that supposed to mean? You know Ernie and... He needs someone that can take care of him. That's his mother's job, Harry. I don't want to be his mother. Even though it'll probably look as though I am. Now, what's an 8-year age difference when you're in love? 7. he just had a birthday. Is this enough? Well, so what. He can go on having birthdays, and you can stop. I saw a gray hair the other day, Harry. Listen... You and Ernie will actually be aging toward each other. Older people start going backwards at some point, and, uh, well, eventually you'll meet in the middle. Am I making a mistake, Harry? It's not just the age difference. It's-- you love him. That's what counts. Listen to you... The voice of experience. Aggie? Hmm? I have to ask you a question. Hmm, can't it wait till I've had a few hours of sleep? No. this is important. Hmm. Just promise me you won't say no. No to what? Just promise. This is very, very important to me. Ok, I promise. Now can I have a few hours of sleep? Fine. We're going to spend the weekend with the good doctor. Doctor caracciolo? I--i don't think that-- at his mother's house. You just swore to me. You just gave me your solemn word. I don't have anything to wear. Aggie, he's a doctor. How fancy can it be? Cusatemi, ma faccio strada. Oh. [Bell rings] Come, come. Oh! Agnes: you never told us about any of this. Caracciolo: i was afraid you might not come. It's so very beautiful. It is you that are beautiful. [Church bells peal] [Speaking Italian] Are--are these bass? Ba-bass? Ah, non capisco. All right. It is the best moment, early in the morning. Yes. I do not wish to hurt Mac's feelings, but... It would please me so greatly if you... Just you alone... Would come back to venice on your next break. D-domenico, i-- hello. Come on, look at these. They're great. Ah, how about me as a clown? Oh, why would that be different? Yeah, I'm going to take one of these home. Um... Domenico: i would buy any mask for you. But this is the one i would choose. Just hold it right there, Mr. Hemingway. Just a couple of more questions, Mr. Hemingway. How'd you feel about being the first American-- thank you, ma'am-- about being the first American wounded in Italy? Well, I would have much rather been the last. [Laughing] You must be very proud of him, Mrs. Hemingway. Ernest was a hero to this family long before he went to war. How exactly were you wounded? Like I said, I was just fooling around in the trenches. I'm sorry, folks, that's enough. I have patients scheduled. Just one more question, Dr. Hemingway. Did you fall for any of those Italian beauties, Ernie? No, but I met just about the best-looking American girl you ever saw over there. Can we have her name? Mrs. Hemingway, soon as the war ends. [Chuckles] Woman: another one for you, Charlotte. Ernest: so I told the folks all about us. Just know you'll win them round, the moment you arrive. Once we're married, I'm sure pops will let us live in his cabin on walloon lake. Imagine. you'll be making the old place spick-and-span, while I write great works. I haven't heard from you in over a week, so I just hope that you're safe and well. Hey, Ernie! Ernie! Wait, let's see them again, Ernie. Ernie, wait! [Car horn blares] [Dog barking] Wait! Let's see them again, Ernie. Hi, Joe. How many of them went in you? 227. Just like these. Nothing from Italy. Sorry, Ernie. I can't complain. She sends me a telegram practically every other day. First all I knew was buon giorno, but now, your poor brother has to sit through my conjugation of verbs. Agnes seems to live only in the present. She has trouble with the past tense, perfetto e imperfetto. Firmato, signor conte. I like to concentrate on the here and now. Amici miei. My dears, I have wonderful news. The armistice has been signed. [Bells pealing outside] The war is over. Now I suppose that the red cross will post you back to America. Hmm. Is that to be your future? Oh, I don't know, domenico. May have to give it up. But why? Medicine is your life as it is mine. Hmm. May I say something? Of course. I-- look. Oh. [Domenico laughing] I was going to say I've never worked with a more gifted nurse. I would hate to give it up. Hey! e' finita! Over there will be the maternity ward, and there the operating room. Wonderful. Where I will be able to do the, um... Taglio cesareo and other surgery when needed. It's exciting. Of course, it will be not so impressive like your Saint John Hopkins, but it will be done with love. Why is it, signorina Agnes, I can perform 6 hours of surgery without the slightest fear, and now... And now mi sto morendo di paura. Excuse me. We should be going now. I'm sorry i brought you here. No, no. Wait. In fondo cosa che io voglio domandarvi á se... [Sighs] I'm sorry. What I'm asking, Agnes, is... Will do you me the honor to be my wife? Presto, presto! Presto! I'm sure miss Von kurowsky has told you we will miss you all very much. You've done a wonderful job. Bravo. Agnes! The porters need to know which transport your bags go on. You have to make up your mind. Going to venice. De long: Come along, everyone that's going. Let's go. No... No, I don't know. I--i--i don't-- I don't know what to do. [Sighs] I can't stop thinking about him. The kid? Agnes... Mmm. Come on. Just see it for what it was. A flirtation. [Chuckles] Maybe even a fling, but that is all that it was. Oh, Mac, it was... It was more than just a fling. I told him i would marry him. You can't marry Ernest Hemingway. I mean...He's a child. You never liked him much, did you? No. Oh... No. I liked him fine, and I think he's as good-looking as sin, but, my god, aggie... He is not a husband. But whatever you decide... I'm with you all the way. Oh, Mac. I can't bear the thought of you leaving. And once again, you are right. I must start thinking with my head. Agnes: dear kid... This is the most difficult letter I've ever had to write. And I'm afraid it's going to hurt you a great deal. But Dr. caracciolo has offered me a wonderful opportunity to help him set up a new hospital here. And he's also asked me to marry him, and I have agreed to consider this. What I do have to recognize, though, is that you and i are years apart, and it would be so very wrong of me to tie you down when there are so many stories yet to write. So after a long think by myself, I have decided that our relationship must come to an end. Mrs. Hemingway: Ernie! Ernie, what's happened? [Knocking on door] Ernie! Ernie, open this door, do you hear? I'm going to get your father! [Crying] Agnes, my brother has waited a long time to find true love. I do hope you will say yes. You could be so happy here. May I? I love to dance. [Waltz playing] Dolce Agnes... Having you in my arms make this the most beautiful waltz in the world. [Car horn honks] Man: taxi. Taxi. Good day, ma'am. I believe there's a reservation for... Excuse me. Agnes, how great to see you. You too, Harry. Won't you... Thank you. You look so grown up. I must say, a suit looks much better on you than a pair of pajamas. You look just as beautiful. I, uh, I took the Liberty of ordering a chianti for old times' sake. Uh, may I? For old times' sake. Feels more like a hundred years than... 8 months, is it, since we saw each other last? Do you remember? Certainly. you were... Giving front-line advice to the lovelorn. Which I, uh, understood you didn't take. I'd, uh...I'd heard you'd married the good doctor, but i--i don't see a wedding ring. No, no, I didn't marry domenico. I think I've made a mess of things all the way around, Harry. How did you hear i was married? How do you think? I heard through an angry, gin-soaked voice over the telephone at 3:00 in the morning. Do you ever see him? No. But I get raging, rambling letters from him, mostly about you. He's very angry. He has every right to be. Where is he? Well, he's at walloon lake. Trying his hand at scribbling. Living off his old man, if you ask me. Do you mind if I ask you something? Hmm. Do you love him? Did you ever tell him? Yes. But I don't think he heard. Don't you think it might be a good idea to tell him now? Catch any bass? What are you doing here? There are some things that needed to be said. I just hope it's not too late. Do you want a drink? [Ahem] all right. In that case, I'll have one, too. How's your leg? Is that a personal or a professional question? Ernie-- absent friends. Do you remember dottie? She...she married burnside... Of all people. And Rosie? Rosie ran off with Larkin. Mac said if I see you again, i should say hello. As you'd expect, she's still with the red cross. It's, uh... She's nursing in Cuba. Birdseed. never liked him. Pompous ass. Are you in touch with any of the boys? Harry sometimes. Yes, he says you've been...Writing. Sold a few pieces. Jesus, it's stuffy in here. Beautiful. Just as I'd imagined it would be. My little palazzo in the woods. I heard you and, uh, Dr. what's-his-name didn't go through with it. Why not? Too old? It was a mistake. There was always somebody else. Anyone I know? Who else but you, Ernie? It still is. That's why i had to come back here, and I had to tell you how sorry I am. Sorry for what? It was the war. Lot of things happen in the war. What did either of us know? No, we knew. We knew. You can't deny that. We had a fling... Kid stuff. There's still a part of me that... Wants to take you in my arms. Just like it used to be. But I've changed. Of course. Things change. It wouldn't work. Not now. Not this time. Oh, kid. Kid grew up, ag. Thanks to you. I love you. I'll love you as long as I live. Agnes: I never saw Ernie again after walloon lake. I often wonder what might have happened if he had taken me in his arms. But I guess his pride meant he wasn't able to forgive me. Some say he lived with the pain of it all his life. The hurt boy became the angry man, a brilliant, tough adventurer, who was the most famous writer of his generation. And the kid he had been... Eager...idealistic... and tender... Lived on only in my heart. Captioning made possible by new line home video captioning performed by the national captioning institute, inc.
