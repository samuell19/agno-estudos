Granpa? - Is it the book you wrote? - Huh? The book you wrote? Yes. Thanks to Miss Robinson. Who's Miss Robinson? Oh, yes... Miss Robinson... She taught me to read when I was 30. You couldn't read? Well, no. I couldn't read. Don't be sad, Granpa. I can't read either! Come closer. I'll tell you... Lost somewhere in the Far West. Is a wild area that the railroad hadn't reached yet. "Big City' was a charming little town. With its Main Street... I'll be back! Now I'll call you Mister Sheriff! Thanks, Tyler. Its school... Hurry! Line up, kids. Quiet! - Hello, kids. - Hello, teacher! You can go in. What did I do? Bobby! I didn't do anything! Into the classroom! Lts church... Stop confessing your evil thoughts to me. It gives me nightmares! I'm not a priest, I'm a pastor. Got that? We don't have confession. Now scram! Anyway, you Irishmen never liked Italians! You phony priest! You shoulda been a nun! You no worship the Virgin, you 10th rate priest! Lts saloon... Look at that! It's dirty here! Clean up! Your dad's a champ, Wayne! In short. Big City was one of those little towns that sprouted in the old West... nibbling endlessly at the Indian lands. Yet. The redskins left us alone. An Indian legend said that across the river. In Big City. All was cursed. Soon vowed to destruction by the black demons of the sky and the earth. Which is why the Indians had never attacked Big City. - Mr Anderson, how are you? - Mr Mayor. Vote for me Sunday, pardner. Don't forget! Hello, Mister Barber. Hello, Your Honor. Vote for me Sunday. - Sure, I won't fail. - I thank you for it. Dummy, say hi to His Honor the Mayor. Hi, Mr Mayor! Hello, citizens of Big City. So we lived in peace. Waiting for a big wagon train of settlers who'd make our little city grow. Vote for me: You'll get the railroad and maybe the telegraph! Have a nice day, my friends. Have a nice day, Mr Mayor. Bye, Mr Mayor! Enjoyed the pat?, Mrs Wilson? It was delicious, as usual, Mr Tong! Until the day when... Sheriff! The wa! - The wagon train? - Right. We were attacked by Ind... - The Indians. - The Indians, exactly! They're across the river. They're all over: Big ones, little ones... It's a calamity! All men over 12 come with me! I'll be 12 next month, can I join you? Get on, son! Great! Try to find me, Tyler! Sheriff! If I come with you, can I have a revolver? No, I can't, Banjo. - You're a... - An idiot! - Cretin! - Retard! Numbskull! Canadian! Different! You're different. So you stay here, OK? Bye, fella! Let's go! OK, but... - We'll slay 'em. - Hang tight, Junior. You're here? They all left! What? You gotta go! Get over there! Watch out, Dad! Nice going, Junior! There were more and more Indians. The men of Big City were outnumbered. So it was decided... that the women would also go to fight. Come on, girls! Madam, please. Can I come with you? No, you can't, Banjo! - But why? - Because... You're not a woman! But all the men have gone! That's how it is. Come on! Get a move on! Hurry! Kids, whatever happens, don't move from here! We'll be back before nightfall. God be with you! I love you, darling. Let's go! That's when the story of Big City really began. We were winning, when other Indians came up behind us. From the river. And the parents? - Were they all killed? - Shut up! I don't know. An Indian hit me on the head, I fell into the water. I don't know how I got back here. What'll happen to us? Wayne is the greatest! I knew it! They're all dead. No, there are no bodies! That means nothing. When you die, you go to heaven. Well... Maybe they're all already in heaven. Come look! Are the parents hiding in the fort? Where else could they be? Let's hope they warned the cavalry before the Indians chop the telegraph poles. What got into the Indians? Up till now, we lived in peace, each on our side... Maybe that's the problem: We each lived on our side. When the Indians saw the wagon train, they knew the whites would grow faster. What'll we do, Wayne? Until our parents get back, no goofing off! That's no problem. I'm the oldest, now. I'll keep tabs on you. Gee up, Pixie! More soap! I want it to foam. More soap! What's the Sheriff up to? Stop it! You thieves! You punks! I'm too young to die. I don't want to die! Attack! What's all this? What's going on? Poor old Tyler... You've really had it. I must be in hell. Hey, kids! Where are your parents? Our forebears were right: This territory is cursed! The territory isn't cursed. It's the palefaces who tread on it: They only know how to destroy the world. Come on, little brother. Listen to me! Will you listen! Listen, everyone! I want a doctor! We just had a talk with Mr Tyler. We're goofing off! We gotta reorganize this city! That's for sure! They destroyed the whole store. What'll I tell my parents? We've quit washing, and spend all day eating junk food. We have pimples and toothaches, it's not healthy! This city needs to be controlled. We must elect responsible people! Mr Tyler has the floor. I don't know anyone responsible. The kid's right! She's right! Shut up! Shut up! That's better. Now we can talk. We gotta call this city to order. Let's start at the start: We need a Mayor. Who wants to be Mayor? - Me! - I do! Who do you think you are? You have no right to City Hall! My family's provided every Mayor since 1732! Since 17... for a long time! This is a democracy, White! If everyone wants thejob, we'll have a vote. You'll be a candidate like the others! It's been like that in America since 1776! Precisely! - Well spoken, Tyler! - Great! - Who wants to be Sheriff? - Me! - I do! - Not a chance! I want to be sheriff! I want to be sheriff! Who wants to run the funeral parlor? Me! I want the funeral parlor! What's a funeral parlor? The undertaker. Guy who buries the dead. No, I don't want that job. Forget it. Just as I thought, we got a problem! We'll do it like in the good old days! This'll please Mr White. Dunce! Everyone'll take over his father's job! Luigi! Now you're a bartender. Get me a whisky, I'm thirsty! Sir! What'll those without a father do? What their mother did! It was always like that! And those without a mother? They'll find sump'n! Yes, but... No dollars, no chocolate! Get lost! - These damn kids! - Hello, Mr Tong! Hello, Mrs Wilson! Nice weather today, no? Real Western weather. It's OK, you may come in. Come in! Mr Banjo, you've been elected Sheriff. You know you have to abide by the law. I've got your signature here. Which I can't show you! If yours isn't like it, you won't get your money. Please understand! Yes, that's my signature! Prove it! Sorry. That is how on the Fourth of July 1776, comma, 1776, comma, they founded the United States of America. Yes, come in! I'm sorry, Ma'am, I'm late: I had to help my brother at the saloon. Don't worry, Jefferson, at least you're here now. Thanks. Let's go on: The United States of America, comma, this vast land of freedom, comma, of justice, comma, of hope for all men of good will to finally see a reign of peace in this world. Full stop. - See you later, pal! - I'll take care of my herd. In the Ingalls family, I want the lumberjack. Well? We can't wait till Thanksgiving! On the cheek, or the mouth? What's best? Depends. Some prefer the cheek, others the mouth. Depends. On the cheek, then. 50 cents! Your hat! Sorry! Sure, sorry. Your turn. May I? Yes, you can! Hi, Wayne! Barman! A strawberry shake! Fine, one latte with a fragola, uno! Why can't I have my lemonade? Can't you read? No. It says thata the house no give credit! I just work here, the bank owns the saloon. Scusa me, Sheriff, you gotta drink, or leave. Enough, now. Give him a lemonade. It's on me. Thanks, Wayne! You're so nice! He's so nice! You broke another? Keep it up, you'll get fired! Well, considering what I'm paid... How much is it? 50 cents on the cheek, a dollar on the mouth. A dollar? That's expensive! Take it or leave it. No bargaining! OK. One dollar! Take it easy! I didn't do anything! Shut up! Bet he Frenched her! Yeah! Family! My hero! Didn't hurt! Nice going, Wayne! Go on, Wayne! Please! Hi, is your big brother in the kitchen? Yes... Well, no. Signorina White. He was 13, he left to defend the wagon train. I see... Poor guy. I'll say, dammit! But tell me, you know his minestrone recipe? Sure! My whole family does! Granma tolda it to the mamma, who tolda my brother who tolda me. But of our whole family, the one who makes it best, it'sa me! We're entertaining, tonight. Please, be at our stove... at 6 PM? Yes, Signorina White! Thanks, Luigi. You grew some more, Wayne! Yes, Miss White! 2 inches! Can I help you? Yes. Come to dinner, Wayne. Me? To dinner? Yes, Wayne! Great! Anyway, I'm available! Don't fail me. Be there! That snooty Brit! She's so pretty! She's so pretty! Enough, you! Pick it up! She's got class! - Excuse me, ma'am. - Yes? All I have is 25 cents. Can I get something for 25 cents? Yes, of course. We're closed for tonight! Closed! This is what you wanted, Mr White. Perfect! These gold nuggets will work miracles! Let me explain: My folks own some worthless land by the river. Doug and Wallace, hide these nuggets on the land! Then... I'll sell the "goldmine" to Gershwin, the banker. And dear enough so he has to borrow money from you, Mr Quick. You'll take his bank as collateral, he'll plan to repay with the gold he mines. But he'll be ruined! A clever plan, but I know Gershwin, he's suspicious. Who says he'll fall for it? Me! I'll let Big City's finest citizen discover the gold mine! James Wayne! It's brilliant! He's brilliant! Yes, brilliant! We'll divvy up the bank. I'll name you Finance Minister, I'll be on our banknotes! As for you two, you'll rule this city with me, like kings! Brilliant! A light, Quick? No thanks, makes me sick! Your father'd be proud of you, Mr White! God rest his soul. I always thought Dad was weak! Of course, no one must know of our scheme. Yes, sure. Not even my sister. Of course. Yes? Oh, Tong. Hi, Mr White. Your Halloween costumes are ready! - Halloween? - Already? - It is an honor, Mr White. - Thanks. Thanks a lot, Mr White. Do these Chinamen think Big City wants them? - Right, boss! - They're sly! As of now, for our meetings and operations, we'll wear our Clan's outfit! Beautiful! Brilliant! By the way, we'll also get rid of Tong. So we have total control! You'll get his grocery store! Easy, it ain't darkie skin! There was a war so blacks became free! Don't say things like that! We're not slaves, anymore! It's true! Well spoken, Independence. We're not slaves. Sorry, Independence. Those words, I've always heard them, so they don't bother me! Well, they do me! They do me! Sorry. I promise I won't say it again. Gimme my pants, please. Sorry... Sorry... I just wanted to say thanks for what you did, James... That's OK, Nicole. That's OK! She saw your ass! Damn, my flowers! Damn! Where I did put them? No, Pixie! Hi. Hi, Miss White asked me... Yes, I know. If you'll please... Yes. Nasty beast! He could've brought flowers! Madam is waiting for you. It's so beautiful! There you are, Wayne. Delighted to see you. Oh, yes... Same here, Miss White. Same here! My kid brothers so admire you. They're thrilled to dine with you! Really? It's not just us? I'm thrilled too! Did you write it? No, Chopin did! Yes, Chopin, of course! Sure! Minestrone, Luigi style! Thank you, Luigi! What was I saying? Oh, yes... My dad said there was gold there. Really? He never told me. Of course. He didn't want anyone to know. But, now that he's gone, I'll finance the prospecting. Which one? That's why I thought of you... Wayne! Me? Why? I'm a farmer, not a gold miner! That's true. But if you accept this mission, and if you find gold, I'll give you 100/0 of the mine. You could develop your ranch... And make a woman happy. It's a nice offer. But, why me? Because you're thought of as honest, hard-working, and brave. That's so true! You're our city's pride! Simon and Garfunkel are right. You're a powerhouse, Wayne! Thanks. Thanks. Lord, we thank You for this meal that we receive from Your hands with gratitude. And please, O Lord, bring us back our parents safe and sound, if such is Your wish. Amen. Elbows! Gold exists as dust, in grains, sometimes as nuggets. The problem is, to get a few ounces, you gotta grind tons of gravel, very finely. That's why we use sluices to filter the mineral. One can also use chemicals on the gravel: Gold resists acids! You're so fascinating! Other than that, ever think of having a family? Sometimes. But as my dad used to say: "It's easier to catch a cow than a woman who can cook!" Could I be that woman? Yes, of course. I mean, no! I've thought of it, like everyone else. Anyway, I'm just a farmer... Yes, that's true. But I often think of you, Wayne. Before I fall asleep, I imagine us married, living on a big ranch, with lots of... Cows? - No, lots of... - Horses? No, lots of kids, Wayne! Oh, yeah... Kids, why not! We'd have a boy and call him... Wallace! "Wallace Wayne". It's hard to pronounce. No, you're right. We'll call him... John! That's it. "John Wayne". That sounds good, no? What if it's a girl? No girls! They look dumb on a horse! What are you doing?! The barrel's split and the acid's leaking! Rivers aren't trash cans! I know they aren't! What are you doing? Grab the pulley! Help! Miss White! You screamed? Got a problem? - What is it? - Nothing. I... I saw a snake... A rattlesnake! A rattler? They're rare here. There's more down south. Shall we go? You think all Indians are bad? Yes, all. All of them. My dad used to say: "A good Indian's a dead Indian." And Dad was always right. Gold! Gold! We found gold! Well, I have to go, Miss! See you soon. See you soon, Wayne! It's gold, boss. Hurry! OK, I'll be right there! Bye. Hurry, it's gold, boss! Hurry! OK, I'm coming. I'll sum it up: Mr Aaron Gershwin, you're buying the land called... "Riverbank". For the sum of... $20,000... with $1,500... - No, $15,000! - Yes, right. $15,000 from your own pocket, and another $5,000... from a loan provided by the lender, Elliot Quick. It is also agreed that you'll pay interest of $100 dollars per day, and in case of... non-payment... the bank becomes Mr Quick's property. - Everyone agrees? - Yes, sure. We all agree. Absolutely. Now you just have to sign. Luigi! Get us a drink. Some good whisky! You're making a great deal, Gershwin! I agree! And... with a partner like Mr Wayne, I'm not worried! Neither am I. Mr Elliot Quick? Sorry to bother you... I've got a pal who's short of cash. How much could you lend him on his two pistols and... his Sheriff's badge? It's dumb, those cats did nothing! Shut up! Those were the boss's orders! Careful! One can't see in these hoods! They're not practical. "They're not practical." Why d'you pretend to be one-eyed? To look meaner! Like Dad. Don't talk about our parents, it's too sad. It's true. One... two... three! Bye, pussycats! You look worried, Mr Wayne. Because of Gershwin, the banker? He has cause to get worked up. Those guys only think of profits. They don't understand hard work! Yet, Gershwin is right: In 10 days, we should've found a Iode. What worries me, is that the nuggets we found all had clay on them. So what? Unless I'm mistaken, there's no clay on this land. Come on, hurry! - We're rushed! - Coming! All done? Giddyap! Excuse me, anybody seen my cat? A Siamese. It disappeared 2 days ago! That's strange, mine did too. Mine, too. Last week. Really? It's odd: Now Mr Tong makes rabbit pat?, no more cats! What's all this? The truth! I hear your pat? has a funny taste! That's a lie! His pat? is delicious! And my cat isn't gone! How odd: Only Betty Wilson's cat isn't gone! We all know the Chinaman and you are in love! Not at all! Do you love me, Mr Tong? Not one bit! So? You see? Leave him alone! Let him go! He's my brother! He's a kid, he didn't realize! Let him go! - Wait! - What did he do? Stole a book from Simon & Garfunkel! He can have mine! Still, he's a thief! No, he's a kid, White! - He's a kid. - It's true! You have no right. You're a bully! - It's unfair! - It's rotten! You can't do that! Sheriff, throw this scumbag in jail! - You wretch! - Jefferson! Don't touch me, blackie! Don't call him blackie! What have you done now? I just wanted to learn to read! It's not fair! I warn you: If you fight the Law, you'll go to jail, too! Get out! Get out, yourself! Who do you think you are? Don't stand there! Get inside and work! - You, too! - You're a lousy mayor! Right, a lousy mayor! - Hello, Mr Quick. - Hello, Mr Mayor. Get to work! We'll find that gold, I tell you! This'll speed things up! Guys, turn this land into a sieve! Wait, Gershwin! These men never handled dynamite, and they're in my care! Watch out! Those ain't firecrackers! I know it's risky, but I'm in a bind. I gotta deliver 2 Ibs of gold to Elliot, or I lose my bank! Go to it, blow it up! If we find the Iode, I'll double your pay! Gods speak. First comes big thunder... Come, Kiki. Come, little pussy... Come. It's not funny anymore. Come to bed. And three! Please be quiet! Be quiet! We're in a classroom! Thank you! Write the date: Monday, October 13, underline it. Then write: "sums" and underline it. Miss Robinson? Yes, Shirley? Is it true that the Chinese eat cats? Of course not! Well, I don't think so... Yes, they do eat cats! Even rats, our brother told us! I heard some of them eat people! Stop it! Shut up! Enough! Stop! Stop it! I'm the Sheriff! Murderer! I'm not a murderer, I didn't kill any cat! I'm innocent! I'm not a murderer, I didn't kill cats! Shut up, it's unfair! You have no proof of it! You can't arrest someone on hearsay! It's not hearsay, it's true! He's a decent guy, I say he didn't do it! I agree. Shut up, ratface! Go home! I didn't kill any cats, I never killed cats. First case. The State, represented by Mr White, versus the accused: Jefferson Arnold Warner... defended by his schoolteacher, the lovely Miss Robinson! Prisoner, stand up! Do you admit having stolen the handbook: "Learn To Read", published in 1873? I planned to return it, Your Honor! Maybe, but that wasn't the question, kid. Confess, thief! So, you admit the crime. Here we go... "Taxes", "Temperance", "Thanksgiving"..."Theft"! "Any man guilty of theft... "will be sentenced... "to be hung by the neck, "until death doth ensue!" No, Your Honor, please. No, sorry... That's for horse-thieves! No... Here we are: "Theft". "Theft of a valueless object": "5 lashes and 3 months jail." Your Honor, that's the sentence for a white man! Objection, Your Honor! The North won the Civil War and that victory abolished slavery in 1865! Well spoken! Well spoken, Miss Robinson! The texts may say that. But you must agree that a Negro hasn't the same rights as us! Yes, of course. - Nice going, boss. - Brilliant! But we can't triple it! That's too much, specially at his age. We'll give him... 6 months jail and 10 lashes! Very good. You see, the war changed nothing! Next case: The State versus Tong Li Wuong, Jr. The prisoner refuses to plead guilty? That's his right, Your Honor! - Absolutely. - The State calls the first of the 12 plaintiffs: Mr Wallace Spencer. The defense has the floor. To sum up, Your Honor, don't forget that Mr Wayne regularly sold rabbits to Mr Tong. And that Miss Betty Wilson said she talked to Mr Tong, the same evening her cat... Called Kiki? ...disappeared! It is not funny! Inadmissible evidence, Your Honor. We all know Miss Wilson has a crush on the prisoner! - The bastard! - That's a lie! - Not true! - Liar! "It's not true!" Order in Court! Will you swear it on the Bible, Miss Wilson? For "mislabeled goods", "animal theft", and "attempted poisoning", Tong is sentenced to: 30 lashes, one year in jail, loss of civil rights, confiscation of his business which goes to the City, hence to Mr White! Court adjourned! Your Honor! What about my case? - Right, what about his case? - No... I forgot that one! Let's see... Mr Elliot Quick, moneylender, having lent the sum of $5,000... to Gershwin, the banker who is unable to pay him back. I'll pay him back! The Court has decreed that the Gershwin bank now belongs to Mr Quick! Now, let's drink! What have I done? I betrayed my family! Break it up! Go home! Go home! What a session! Go ahead, have fun! Have fun, Your Honor. Poor sap! It's a disgrace! You got them sentenced! You're a creep, White! Watch out, Frenchie! Big City scorned your mother, and won't miss you! You know she's right! You and Mr Quick schemed to control the city! You're Mafiosi! That's enough, scumbags! I've had it! You and you, you're fired! Know what? You're all fired! Fired? We never worked for you! That's true, and you never will! Tell them, Elliot! It's simple. The saloon belonged to the bank. Now the bank is mine. Mr White just bought the saloon from me. So clear out! All of you! What'll happen to them? The sentence'll be carried out tomorrow. Tonight, all we can do is pray for them. I'll let you have my room. Tonight, I'll sleep outside. Well... Thanks, Wayne. Nicole! I know your working hours are over... But I really find you... very beautiful. May I kiss you? Yes, of course! No... No need, Wayne. Tonight, it's on me! I think I love you, James... Wayne! Let the show begin! I'll pretend to whip you, you pretend to be in pain. - OK? - OK. Shout loudly, and you'll be fine. Any time, executioner! Be brave, Jefferson! One! Shout louder! Two! Our executioner has gone soft! Three! I'll take care of it. Go to it, boss! One! Two! Three! Miss White! - Help! - Deborah! Giddyap, Pixie! Help! Help me! - Jefferson, you OK? - Help them, I'll take care of it! Help! Mom! It's OK, Miss! Miss White! Deborah! It was your fault! It was! It's your fault she died! You're all murderers! I'm a cowboy, but I never save anybody! Sorry, I couldn't do anything. The Indians! The Indians are coming! Hide! Lock the doors! Turn off the lights! Mom! One of them's coming. I'll go! And nobody shoots! Nobody! Miss White? You OK? Thanks. Miss White's alive! Come and see, she's back! It's my treat, milkshakes for everyone! Where's Deborah? With Wayne, right? No, she went to the White's place with Betty. She's resting. She deserves it, after what she went through! Quiet! I said quiet! When I say "Quiet", be quiet! Well... I have to talk to you. I have to talk to you, because... I feel dirty. When I say "dirty", I mean inside. Because of you, William White! To take over the city, with your accomplice, your sidekick, Quick, Yeah, Quick... You cheated, you lied. You pitted us against one other! That's a lie! A total lie! You made us believe the Chinaman cooked our cats. All the cats are back! - Yes, it's true! - Liar! You promised me whisky, for the sentences. You have no right! It's nonsense! Don't listen to him. He's hallucinating! Listen, William White... I've been a bad guy as an adult, but you were born rotten! Scum! Beat it, White! You too, Elliot! Don't believe that old boozer! He's an alcoholic, look at him! He's drunk, he's talking crap! Calm down! I may be drunk, but I'm still ajudge! So by the powers entrusted to me, I decree that Gershwin gets his bank back. The Chinaman, his business! Instead of damages... Sir Quick's shop... hey, presto... now belongs to Jefferson! I hate you! Mind the table! Nice left hook, Wayne! The city thanks you. Until the next elections, I name you acting-Mayor of Big City! Now, let's drink! You've ruined me! Get lost! Morning! Hi, Mr Banjo. Hi, Mr Banjo. You're here? Mr Gershwin gave me back all my money! Great! Elliot? Yes, Jefferson? No, call me Mr Warner! Mr Banjo's deposit! Right away, Mr Warner. To be forgiven, he gave me the riverbank land, to build my house there! Fabulous! It's in E, row 3. E... row 3... Behind you! Yes, thanks. There's $12,75. Plus interest, that makes $14. - That much... - Sure. Borrowing's expensive. Ina jimo! We friends! Me Wayne... James Wayne... Us, friends! We bring gifts and horse to thank you! You're very nice, Wayne! I'm Wapiti. Delighted! Your tribe seems very poor, Wapiti. It's true. Your parents killed all the bison that fed us, that gave us clothes and teepees. Last winter, when it was very cold, the soldiers from the fort gave us infected blankets, so we'd catch smallpox. It almost wiped out our village. How could adults do such a thing? How? The white man thinks he can buy nature, when it is he who belongs to nature. He kills us to take our land, but in fact the earth we tread belongs to no one. Go, run! Go, run! Go home at once! A White doesn't belong with all those Indians, that rabble! Where's your sister? Dunno. You don't know? Go home! Don't stare at me! Go on. First a cowboy, now an Indian! Why not an Italian, like Luigi? Or a Jew like Gershwin? You did us every dirty trick. But we won't be disgraced! Come, you! Leave him alone. He's my brother! Move, you little hussy! Tatanka. Tatanka... Let go of her, White! You can't go along with that! She loves that Indian! - What did he say? - That she'll marry the Indian! No way... It's impossible, White! More lies! No! It's true. I love him. What did they say? I can't believe it. I'm sorry. Holy cow! Come, we have to talk. How can I tell you? They're not a family for you! They're wealthy. Put yourself in their shoes: A guy who sleeps in a tent, isn't... And between us, "John Wapiti" sounds rotten! It's a silly name for your kid. What do you say? My friend Wayne spoke frankly. But my love for you, river girl, is like the south wind. My people says: Man... tries to seduce woman, but woman prefers the south wind. The south wind doesn't pounce on a woman. It knows what must precede the dance of love. If a man knows how the south wind embraces, then the woman prefers him, because he's become... a master of love. I'll try to be that man for you, Deborah. What crap! The jerk! Listen... We promise: No one will stop you from seeing her, not even White. But in the meantime, it's best you return to your teepees. Anyway, you're too young to get married. You're not worthy of our family, Deborah! You dare speak of worthiness? Know how old William White is? 11 years? 13 and a half! The coward refused to go defend the wagon train! That's a lie! She's mad, she's a liar! - You're the liar! - You're rotten! - Coward! - You viper! Betraying your own brother! What a liar! True, it was dumb. Calls for a drink. What a scumbag! Don't worry, kid! Until you find a new house, you can sleep in my room. Wayne will put me up at his home. Right, Wayne? Sure. Anything to please Miss White! Watch out! Wapiti! Stop! No! Help, Wayne! Help! Help, Wayne! What's going on? Can't you stand up? Mercy! He's yours, guys! Tried to swipe the boss's sister? You pig! Hurry, Wayne! Let's go, fast! Giddyap, Pixie! My God! Let's hope... your brother and his men didn't finish their work! They're attacking the village! Let's go! Better load your gun, Banjo! My store! Whoa, Pixie! Faster! Put out those fires! Come, Indian! What's wrong with him? Wilburt! Wilburt! I'm sick of it... I'm sick of being a grown-up, I want my mom back! She'll be back! If I die... You won't die. But suppose I die... I don't want to end up in a pine box, at least in an oak one! I'll find redwood! Thanks, Wayne. - Take him to the saloon. - OK. Hold on, Wilburt, you'll be OK. - Everyone to the saloon! - Let's go! Wapiti! Please... Forgive us. White man never harm you again! My father said: "White man's words written on water, "they make many promises, "but only keep one: "To kill all Indians, "and take their land..." And they did it. A chief's wounds dishonor his tribe. This is war! We meet tomorrow at sunrise, at the fort, you'll all die! Farewell, my friend. Farewell... Moje tona ritat. - Easy does it! - Yeah, I'm the Mayor! That's unfair! - Sheriff! - It's disgusting! How is he? Is he OK? Don't worry. Mr Tyler's taking care of him. His fever has dropped. I think he'll make it. I asked the youngest to stay home: This is a grave moment. We gotta face reality: The Indians fight better than us. They're better trained, and braver. Does that mean we're lost? Maybe not... There's a way to beat them. - Really? - Yes? What? Blow them up! How much dynamite you got left? None. I used everything in the mine! Tong? Got any in stock? No, all gone... With Mr Gershwin I did good business! But in my basement, I have liquid explosive. Nitroglycerine? Yes. All who bought it, died transporting it. My father never sold the last 2 cans! The Indians'll charge at us. We'll let them get near. We'll charge too, but stop 30 yards from the trap. That bail of straw will be our landmark. Any shock from a stone... or a horse-shoe will make it explode. Then... there'll be dead Indians all over? Yes. It'll be a bloodbath. You little jerks! You don't know what war is like! I fought in a war, the Civil War. They sent me to kill some poor guys, in Gettysburg. One day, near Chattanooga, I set fire to a whole block of houses, with its inhabitants. We called that "pinning down the enemy"! I remember a girl who'd stayed on the top floor of a house. She was screaming. She had a baby in her arms. And now, in my head, on nights when I'm not too drunk, I hear her screams very loud! But the baby doesn't even cry. Just looks at me. And while I was being a bastard, other bastards came to my home, and killed... my wife, my kids... So, there... That's how I became what I am. So I want to tell you that... since you'll be killing to save your progeny... I hope tomorrow you all die. Little jerks! I sound the call? For the charge. No. First, let's say a little prayer. Lord, protect all true believers and the others, too. If such is Your desire, spare them from death. Amen. And don't forget... the bail of straw! We stop at the bail of straw! Why's he here? Kids, don't stay there! It's gonna blow! Where's that stuff? Tyler! Don't stay there! Mr Tyler? Mr Tyler, you OK? When I was a kid... like you... and I landed with my father... on this damn continent, he said to me... You'll see, kid... here, man will build a better world! You bet! I beg you, try to change the world... Just a little bit. Well... I have to get going... And... Don't try, while my back's turned, to do more dumb things... It came from the fort! It's the cavalry, they've freed the fort! A troop of the 7th Cavalry liberated the parents in the fort. When we reached the top of the hill. The Indians were already in flight. And there were soldiers everywhere. I'll neverforget that scene. It's too late! You can't help them! Stop! Don't move, Indians! Don't move! Don't move. It only took the army 2 hours to free the fort. And wipe out Wapiti's whole tribe. After 8 weeks of absence. Big City celebrated its citizens' return. And the new settlers. At last Big City would become a big city. They're here! What happened to you? - Not much... - We farted around! Listen you, I said no dirty words! She's right! A patch! You look as dumb as Dad! I missed you. My darlings, I missed you! Dad, Mom! - I'm so happy to see you! - Me too! Where's William? Where is he? We thought he was with you! The night you disappeared, he felt guilty. He took a gun and went to join you... The Indians must've grabbed him. My son, my baby! Get in there! Get in, you'll fit! Stop moving! I give you my most precious object: My banjo. It's back to front. Thanks. Let me out! I'll get even! I'll get even! Let me go! I won't live with you! Quiet! You become good Indian. That's your punishment. I don't want to be an Indian! A few years later. The Indian prophecy came true. The gods made it rain on Big City. Horrible black rain. On the land the Gershwins gave me. We struck oil. And that's how your Granpa Banjo got rich. What happened to Wayne? - Who? - Wayne! Oh, yes! Wayne! A fine animal! - Thanks. - I love it! Well... Thanks for your hospitality, Wayne. Don't mention it. My Mom's waiting for me. I must go. Bye! Bye, Wayne. She hoped you'd see her home. Why? She's off to see her mom, in the saloon. She knows the way. Know what, Wayne? What? You're very handsome, strong and brave, but you're also very dumb! Why? Really? Of course! Nicole! Nicole! Wait! Waiting for me for your lesson? - Yes, Miss Robinson! - Sorry, I'm late. Doesn't matter. - We'll start with the alphabet. - Ah... "A" is the first letter. - Know the next one? - Yes... - "B"? - Very good... Take out your book. Know the next one? - "C", as in cowboy. - Bravo. Subtitles: A.
