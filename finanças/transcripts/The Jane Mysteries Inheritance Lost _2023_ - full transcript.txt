A matinee in Monaco tomorrow? Sure. Yes, okay. Thanks Jorge. That's a twelve hour trip! You're nuts. I'm just living the life of a working singer. Do you every want to take a break from all this? What? No! Besides, a gig's a gig. Jane! You're on in five. And some American guy wants to speak to you. Must be a fan. American? A fan? Maybe it's a long lost love from back home? Yeah, I doubt it. Jane Da Silva? That depends on who's asking. Sadie said you might be hard to find. I had no idea there were so many cabaret theaters in Paris. Twenty-nine in St. Germain alone. Yeah, I know that now. You said Sadie sent you? Yes. I'm sorry I don't really know how to say this but your Uncle Harold, he passed. What? No. No no no. His heart condition was just getting better. Sadie was giving me updates. Sadie wanted me to find you and tell you in person. She's also hoping you'll come back to Baltimore with me. Oh Sadie! Oh, she must be devastated. I'm sorry. Who are you? John Cameron. Harold and Sadie are great friends. I'm also a detective with the Baltimore police. Sadie really needs you. And Harold left you an inheritance. An inheritance? I don't care about an inheritance. I've never wanted money from Sadie and Harold. It seems Harold's last wish was to bring you and Sadie back together. He thought you would need each other. And Sadie would like you to help out with his affairs. So, go back to Baltimore? Yeah. Two minutes! Okay. Okay. Look, Sadie doesn't want you to do anything you don't want to do. She wanted you to call her when I found you. Jane! Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming. Uh... I have to go on. Yeah. Okay, um... Yeah. [applause} Oh my dear. He was so happy with his life. He only had one regret. That we never went to Europe to see you perform. I've missed you both so much. Come home. It will be a healing time. For both of us. You know I could help you with your bags. I can carry them on my own, thank you very much. All right. Before we get to the house, I should let you know that I've been assisting Harold at the Foundation for the past couple years. What exactly do you guys do? Seriously? Harold never mentioned his retirement project? I thought investment bankers never retired. He wants to use all his energies for something more than just making money. What exactly does this Foundation do? All will be revealed. Back to being mysterious again. Okay. I've missed you so much. Fifteen years is a long time. Uncle Harold. He always talked about how he fell in love with you. And I knew the minute I saw him in the audience that first time. Do you ever miss it? Life on the road? Oh no. But I remember the pre-show jitters and the post-show highs. Oh, yes! Losing yourself onstage, and buzzing from the applause. Absolutely thrilling! But I also remember the exhausting late nights, endless travel, living out of a suitcase, never knowing when your next gig might be. Mom’s favorite flowers. I like to keep them here to remind me of her. Your uncle always wanted to be there for you and your mom. But when we lost her we knew it was too hard for you to be here without her. I thought running away to Europe would make it hurt less. It’s what you needed to do. Living here amongst her memories was too hard. And here they all are. Thank you for keeping them, Sadie. We kept your car, too. My little cabrio? I can't wait to see it! Your bags are all up in your old room. I should get going. Oh no, please stay, John, and help me introduce Jane to Harold's most important work. The Foundation. This is where your uncle ran the Foundation. It focuses on righting wrongs. And these files are filled with cases that your uncle took on. He solved cases the police couldn't dedicate any further time to. But how can private citizens help where the police can't? Oh, you'll be surprised what can be done. Those aren't just files, those are people. Families. Harold prided himself on helping those who couldn't help themselves. Sort of a non-profit detective agency helping people whom the police and justice system failed. A detective agency? How did I not know about this? The Foundation started in earnest five years ago when Harold retired and started helping people full time. He did it to honor your mother. I think he felt we never had closure on how we lost her. Yeah. Wow. Uncle Harold helped all these people? Those people, yes. But there are still boxes of files and letters of others needing help. I mean, we were just getting started. You helped him with the investigations too? Oh, it was Harold’s passion project. He led the investigations but I helped on research, creating diversions, stakeouts. You know, the fun stuff! And Uncle Harold wanted me to run this Foundation? How? Well, to be honest, I'm a little confused as to why you were picked, also. I mean, this isn't for the faint of heart. It requires skill and dedication. I care about these cases, and I don't want the Foundation wasting any time or resources. Well Detective, I know that my Uncle Harold was an incredibly successful man, and very smart, so he must have known what he was doing. You're right Jane. Harold chose you. And he was a brilliant mind and it's important that we respect his final decision. Agreed. I'll let you get settled. Call me if you need anything. Thank you, John. Well, he seems thrilled to have me head up the Foundation! Oh, he'll come around. Well, I'm amazed at what you and Uncle Harold created. But I don't know how I'm going to take this over, Sadie. I've been a singer my whole life. You became a singer to bring joy to people. Maybe this is another way to do that. What am I thinking? How can I possibly even help here? Hey! Ah, I knocked but no one answered and I saw the light on. I guess I must have had the music up too loud. Are you the Foundation that helps people? No. I'm actually just here visiting. Why are you out here so late? Oh, I waited until my dad fell asleep. You snuck out? I'm Lia. I saw the Foundation's address on the website. You helped my piano teacher find her brother. He's living with her now. I'm looking for help too. Or my mom needs help. Why isn't she here with you? Actually she passed away when I was little. No one will help me find out what happened to her. And I thought if I told them the Foundation was helping me, they'd take me seriously. But still nothing. All right. I don't know that I'm the best person to help but I'm a pretty good listener. Come on in. It's cold out here. Look, I'm sorry that you're going through all this but I don't think I'm the right person to help. I know it sounds crazy because I don't even remember her, but I know in my heart that mom never would have left me on purpose. I was only a baby. Well, I was a year old. But I really know she didn't want to leave me. I'm sorry your mom's not here for you, Lia. It's not fair. My dad says I need to let it go, but I don't know how. There's, like, a hole in me now. Yeah. I lost my mom too. It's been quite a few years but I get that there's a hole in your heart that's impossible to fill. You get it. Mom loved me. That's why I know she didn't want to leave me. Look, she wrote about me in her diary. I made a copy. Lia, I just don't know that I can help you. I didn't even finish college. I'm a singer, I'm a musician. I don't even know how long I'm going to be in Baltimore. She promised she'd always be there for me and be a better parent than her stepmother ever was. Wow. Lia, you're really talented. Is that Chopin? Yeah but I adapted it. Got me into Juilliard! Really! That's amazing. Congratulations! Well, no, I'm not going. Dad says I could go to community college while I save up. I wrote down everything I know. Dad says mom's missing money can't be found, but I think it's gotta have something to do with what happened to her. Wait, there's missing money? Mom's birth father left it to her. She got it right before she died. But no one knows where the money went. It didn't just disappear into thin air! That money is rightfully yours. I guess so. That's what my dad says. Will you help me? Lia, I... I know it sounds hopeless. But that's all I have... Hope. And I'm not giving up on my mom. I should go before my dad notices. If you can please make sure my letter gets to whoever can help me at the Foundation, I would really appreciate it. Yeah, I will. The untimely end of Linda Martin. It certainly fits the criteria for the Foundation's cases. But it's fifteen years old, so it's going to present some challenges. Let's be honest Sadie, I have zero skills. Any case is going to be a challenge at this point. I don't know, there's something about Lia. She kind of reminds me of myself. So maybe you are exactly the right person. Maybe you have the most important skills. Compassion and commonality. And you know how she feels. Yeah, my mom died so suddenly, I never got a chance to say goodbye. Poor Lia, she hardly had the chance to have a mother at all. I know I'll never get closure on what happened to mom, but maybe I can at least help Lia find some answers. She deserves to know the truth. She does. Indeed. Well then... How exactly do I start detecting? Well, Harold said it was simple. talk to people and follow the clues. But I say if you don't know what you're doing act like you do. And of course there is always Detective... Detective John. Great. He does have Detective actually in his job title. Well, then I guess I'll have to act more grateful when he's around. Welcome to the Foundation. One case. I'm going to do this one case for Lia's sake. Hi, I'm looking for some information on the death of a woman named Linda Martin. Let me guess. Another murder podcast? No, I actually, I work for the Foundation for Righting Wrongs. Oh. Good for you, yeah. You still can't waltz in here expecting access to police records, though. I'll take it from here, Bill. No problem. You know I can't break police protocol, but I can be a resource here at the force. That's what Sadie said. Well at least one fan at the Foundation. Okay, no small talk. How can I help you? Look John, you and I don't quite understand why Uncle Harold wanted me involved with the Foundation. But what I do know is that Linda Martin's daughter is looking for answers and I do know how she feels. So, I'm going to take on this one case and then I will go back to Paris and my old life. Okay. The Linda Martin case. Well, it was closed, and beyond the statute of limitations. So even if you find evidence it won't change anything in the justice system. If the case is closed then why are there so many unanswered questions? It looks like the detectives found so much evidence pointing in one direction that it led everyone to draw the same conclusion. Yeah, but aren't you supposed to examine all of the facts objectively? Isn't that kind of the point of the justice system? Yes. But when it looks like a suicide, mostly it is a suicide. A few unanswered questions doesn't mean it wasn't. Yeah but those answers could completely change her daughter's entire future. It says here Linda was a troubled young woman who had a history of mental illness. She invested a significant amount of money in a multi-level marketing company called Inner Inc. I don't think they're around anymore. Multi-level marketing, that's like a pyramid scheme, right? Yeah, essentially, but with the sale of products. Inner Inc. sold crystals. Crystals? Yeah. What did they say about Linda's missing money? It says that Linda withdrew her two hundred and fifty thousand dollar inheritance the morning she died. So there's no way to trace it because it was withdrawn in cash, and well, it's not a crime if she gave it away willingly. Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, that's a lot of money to just disappear. Yeah. It sure is. Did you know that Linda Martin couldn't swim? She did drown, Jane. If she intended to end her life, it's not beyond reason. Right? Why did they think it was a suicide? It says here, she broke into the aquatics wing of the Collingwood Club. And the next morning her body was found at the bottom of the pool with a large amount of prescription anti-anxiety drugs in her system. She also tied weights to her body, so, there certainly was intention there. Was there a suicide note? No. And her family said Linda's health had been unraveling for quite some time. Her therapist corroborated. Detectives thought it was an open and shut case. And I'm somehow supposed to prove all these people wrong? How am I going to do that? Well, you're asking the right questions. Trust your instincts. -Here you go. -Thank you. Nailing this detective thing already! Door's open! Please, please, please tell me you're here because you're taking the case? Yes, I am. Thank you! I just, I really hope I can help you find some answers, Lia. I'll get the box of mom's old stuff. There might be something useful in there. Great. Can I help you? Oh, ah, hi. I'm just here to meet with Lia. And you are? Jane Da Silva, with the Foundation for Righting Wrongs. Lia had contacted us about a case... I told her not to do that. Oh. Well, Mr. Martin... Kenny. Kenny, Kenny. I just want to help Lia find some closure and perhaps pursue her dreams at Juilliard. Please don't look into this. Some things are best left alone. She is a great kid but she doesn't need the distraction. With all due respect, sir, Lia deserves answers. Maybe you deserve answers. We have the answers. We just don't like them. Linda was duped by this pyramid scheme. She lost all our money and then she lost her mind. Well, I can see how it may appear like that at first but one of Linda's diary entries paints a very different picture. Okay, who knows what stories to believe from that diary. She kept a lot of secrets from me during our marriage. She talked to her shrink more than she talked to me. What good did that do her? Could he save her? No. None of us could. Well, do you really believe that Linda killed herself? I don't know why a woman who couldn't swim would break into a pool and tie herself down with weights if she wasn't trying to kill herself. Now could you please stop dredging up the past and leave. We don't need to live through this all over again. Dad! Jane is here to help us. No, she is not. Thank you, Ms. Da Silva, but Lia has a recital we have to prepare her for. Of course. I understand. Break a leg, Lia. You know, if I could... Stay away from my daughter. How are things going? Well, Lia's dad basically forbade me from taking the case. So, not great. He did seem really angry, though, that Linda Martin had lost their life savings. So, who knows, that could be motive! Could be. But it's a little early to jump to conclusions just yet. What did you find in the case file? There's not much in here. It seems like they had written off Linda as a crazy, emotional woman. -Infuriating. -I know. But I do have an appointment with her therapist tomorrow afternoon. So I'm hoping he can give me a little insight into her mental state. An excellent first step. What's next? Well if I follow all the information in this file, I'll wind up with the same answers the police got. So, there's basically a million next steps. Well, it's a good thing you don't have to do it all by yourself. What can I do? Umm... You know what? Have you heard of a company called Inner Inc.? Give me a bit I'll see what I can dig up on my trusty tablet! But first things first. Come. I have something I want to show you. I know you're discouraged, but you can do anything you set your mind to. You just need to believe it. Sadie, I appreciate... You're a creative, driven woman who shines under pressure, and can improv her way out of any situation! If you find yourself stuck on a case, it might be time to use those creative bones of yours. What is it? My closet! Oh my...! I was waiting for just the right moment to show you all of this. Are these the gowns from your tours? Uh huh. I wore that one at Carnegie Hall. And that one at the Collingwood Club in '89. Oh, just beautiful. Woo! What about this? Oh! It's a prop from the first movie I was in. I only had a few lines, but as you know... There are no small parts! I kept this one for you. Your mother would have wanted you to have it. Wow. Wow! I just can't believe you've kept all this. It's incredible. I used to come shopping in here when working a case with Harold. Because you know, sometimes a little costume goes a long way. Bricks don't float and neither will you. It's all starting to feel a little too dangerous for a first case. That's the marvelous part. Harold used to say as soon as you start ruffling feathers you know you're on the right track. Jane, maybe you're trying to do a little bit too much too fast. Maybe. But I have to agree with Sadie. Obviously we are asking some questions that's disturbing someone. We just don't know who. I've done some research and I have... "An incredible business opportunity you're not going to want to miss out on!" Activate your life with our activated crystals! Find your inner flame! The power burns within you. Be your own boss! People lost their life savings to this? As far as I've found, Linda was part of this lifestyle brand that claimed improved life energy and self-empowerment through crystals. I mean, what's not to love, right? Except it was a classic run your own business pyramid scheme. People, like Linda, invested and then lost a lot of money when a big front page article debunked healing crystals as nothing more than pretty rocks. They had a recording from someone in the upper ranks of Inner Inc. saying, and I quote, some people are just suckers for shiny things. That's awful. Taking advantage of vulnerable people like that. The company quickly dissolved when the fraud was revealed. And guess when that happened? Right after Linda died? Bingo! Could that be a coincidence? Maybe Linda found out something she wasn't supposed to know? Or maybe Inner Inc. convinced her to give them the inheritance in exchange for good vibes? Either way there is no way to prove that Linda was coerced out of the money. Why would a company swindle a quarter of a million dollars from Linda, only to go bankrupt shortly after? Well, I've done some digging and it seems that Dwayne Wayne started yet another self-help company called the Wayne Society. Maybe he used the money to start the new business? If Wayne was at top of the pyramid and moving up the suspect list, where exactly did Linda fit into the scheme? I'll do some more digging. Well, if Linda found out about the fraud and stopped selling, then the people above her might have been upset because she was making them lose money. And don't forget, the people she signed up for their own bogus crystal business. There could be animosity there too. Let's get started. But there's some holes to fill. And we've got some people to talk to. Harold always said that rest was equally important to work, Jane. I know, but we're so close to cracking something. You know, I wonder if there was any security footage from fifteen years ago? I didn't see a DVD in the police file or anything. But maybe they logged it digitally? I'll text John. And I'm going to take Harold's advice. Tomorrow will be just as busy day as today. Sounds good. Sadie? Did you forget something? Sadie? Lia! Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I just thought you were an intruder. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. Sadie told me to come right in. I don't know if that's such a good idea given what your dad said. He won't be home for another hour. These are my mom's. I thought you could get to know her. This is so awesome, Lia. Thank you. This is really going to help. Do you know who this Richard is? No. But that's my mom's writing. Sorry about my dad. He doesn't like talking about mom. He's still upset after all this time. I think he feels guilty about what happened to her. Guilty? I overheard him talking to his friend last year. He said he and mom got into a fight that night. He let her leave. I always thought he loved her. But if he did, why didn't he help her? Well, unfortunately things aren't always that easy. Life just isn't fair sometimes. Sit. You know, I lost my mom too. About fifteen years ago in a hit and run. There's no rhyme or reason to these things. It just happens. There was anything I could do about it and they never found out who hit her. That's terrible. Yeah. But it changed the way I lived my entire life, Lia. Whatever this investigation brings I'm sure that your dad is just worried that it will change everyone for you too. Maybe he doesn't want me to find out about what he did. I think it's a little early to jump to those kinds of conclusions. I don't care. I just want the truth. I know my mom wasn't perfect but that's pretty much all I know about her. That, and her dreams. She kept dreaming about meeting some weird bird. I dreamt again about the Birdie preaching of rainbows when the clouds are gray. Then chases after time, but it always flies away. She's dreaming about birds. What does this mean? Richard... What is your involvement here? All right. Richard... Any Richards listed with Inner Inc.'s scam? Ah... Richard Florian. Hi, I'm looking to speak with Richard Florian? Speaking. Do you happen to remember anyone named Linda Martin? Who is this? I'm calling on behalf of her daughter. I was hoping to ask you a few questions about your relationship with Linda. Linda Martin had a daughter? Yeah. Any information you have would be greatly appreciated. How did you two meet? In group therapy. We were friends. And you were also involved with Inner Inc.? I was a struggling artist at the time. Linda had mentioned it was a great way to make money. But I lost my investment. Did that affect your relationship? She left group therapy and started doing private sessions. I didn't see her much after that. So... How long did she spend with the group? Too long. We both did. Turns out I shouldn't have doubted my sanity. I was fine. Look, I got to go. Please. Um... Did she ever mention a birdie or a bird with rainbows? She seems to be kind of preoccupied with that. I can't talk right now. I just have a few more questions. Maybe we could speak later? Come by my studio tomorrow. I'll text you my address. Great. Hey! They know. No no no no. I'm telling you, they know! Well, I love this place! Makes me feel like I'm back in Europe. I thought we could talk about the case in a more civilized manner. With music! Harold and I loved to come here when we worked a case. The music helped us think. Yeah, the music is helping me focus. You know, I can't stop thinking, why was Linda at the pool that day? Stirring things up seems to be inviting a lot of trouble. Maybe it's time to be a bit more discreet. I can do discreet. Who's headlining tonight? You're going to love Beatrice. Her voice is spectacular. Four-octave range. Wow. Baltimore native. Been on the scene for years. My dad had an Aunt Beatrice. Yeah, we used to call her Birdie. Hi there! The lockers are just there for your bag. Oh great! You must be new here. Wow, you're good. You must see a lot of faces. Yeah, a lot. Been working here for a few years. I hear this club has a bit of a past. I was looking up reviews online, and I kept seeing the death of a woman named Linda Martin. Yeah. That was awful. I was the one who found her when I came in to work. Really? Yeah, I'll never forget. Terrible. I used to see her in the lunchroom in our coffee shop. Sitting by herself, writing furiously in some notebook. It was kind of intense. Sort of nuts. So she was a little unstable but anything else weird happen around that time? I mean, if anyone was going to remember it, I'm sure it would be you. No. There was something that didn't happen. Mr. Wayne, a super diligent guy. Dwayne Wayne? Yeah. He'd show up every morning when I was opening. He'd swim 40 laps every single morning for years. And for whatever reason, he didn't come in that morning when I found that woman. Wow... That is strange. I also heard he has his own private pool now. Oh really? Morning John! Morning Cindy. Margaret Jane. Hi, yes. I'm thinking about pledging for a membership here. So, you know, umm... Yeah, I don't really feel like getting my hair wet today. So I think I'm just going to take a look around, and get a feel for the place. Hope to see you again soon! Hi. Didn't recognize you there. What was that all about? Well, yesterday, I ran into a bit of a problem telling people I was an investigator. They didn't want to talk. So today I just didn't say it. Ah. So, graduating to undercover work I see. You know, Harold never disguised himself in a hat and glasses to get info for a case. Oh well, Cindy over there seemed all too happy to gossip with a new member. So... Ah, so should I maybe grab us a coffee and meet you at the station? Yeah, let's do that. -See you. -See you. That is a locker key! Wow... Nice catch. Okay, roll with me here. We know that Linda was at the club first thing in the morning, right? And then Cindy saw her in the coffee shop around lunchtime. So we know she also had access to the pool then. What if she was hiding the money in a locker? She was hiding two hundred fifty thousands dollars cash in a locker? Maybe it was a hand off of some sort. Some kind of payoff. Cindy did say that she saw Linda writing furiously in her notebook all by herself. Maybe that's because she was trying to hide a ton of cash? Jane, the lockers were all checked. They were empty. Did you ever get that security footage? No. They didn't give it to me. Seriously? The investigation was closed. Sadly many many years ago. Maybe there's another list of members that were at the pool that day? Well, I could contact the club, see if they have any old records, but fifteen year old files, unlikely. So Linda was at the pool around noon. Then she went to the coffee shop... You know, Cindy also mentioned that Dwayne Wayne used to go swimming every morning at the pool until the morning that Linda's body was found. Come on. That's a busy club. You'd have to add a hundred names to that list. Okay. So Linda starts at the bank. Right? Then, drives to the Collingwood Club, drops off the cash. Goes to therapy after that. Goes home, gets in an argument with her husband, and then drives all the way back across the city to break into the pool. Why? Well, following your theory, if she left something in the locker, maybe she wanted it back. Yes! Yes, that's it! Good. Now you have a theory. Let's get some evidence, hmmm. On it. Oh, I actually have to take off. I am going to meet with Linda's therapist this afternoon. Okay. Be careful. Because remember, you're not Sherlock Holmes. Funny. Thanks for the coffee! Oh yeah. No problem. Of course I remember Linda. As soon as you called yesterday, she came right to mind. Very tragic case. I'm just trying to gain some insight into her mental state at the time of her death. Of course. Unfortunately, I can't share her file with you. We have a policy of destroying documents of deceased patients. Of course. However, I do recall spending a fair amount of time with her. She was deeply unstable. Ambiguous family dynamics led to several unresolved conflicts. Then she came into some money, which only complicated her circumstances. Did she talk much about that? The inheritance was a burden for her. The same way a lottery win can be a curse for some. For her it drummed up feelings of jealousy, resentment, entitlement, in all of her relationships. Yeah, I'm beginning to understand that. She became extremely paranoid, developed hallucinations. Group therapy was no longer the right fit. So I suggested one-on-one counseling. And what did that involve for Linda? I encouraged her to journal, to identify her core negative beliefs in an effort to destroy them. Did she talk about what she wanted to do with the inheritance? Just that she wanted to be rid of it. It wouldn't have surprised me if she gave it all away to that Inner Inc. as exchange for some personal salvation. Did she talk about Inner Inc. a lot? Oh yes. Endlessly. Mostly about that Wayne charlatan. The fraud was apparent to me. But it would not have been difficult for him to take advantage of her, in her delicate, impressionable state. Do you believe Linda was suicidal? It's a horrible thing, but when I heard of Linda's death, I was not shocked. She was riddled with guilt for losing all of her husband's savings, bringing her family into a failure of a business. Did she ever mention anyone named Richard? Or talk about birds? She seems to have be preoccupied with them. Birds... Umm.. Not that I recall. Richard... maybe. I recall she had a friend that she had a falling out with. I'll ruminate on it. I'll let you know if I remember anything else. Great. Thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it. -Nice to see you. -You as well. Hmm... That's a really great painting. I'm very lucky to have some very talented clients. And if you ever need anyone to talk to, I'll be here for you as well. Thank you. I appreciate it. Richard? Richard? We spoke on the phone yesterday. I just wanted to come by and ask you a few questions. Thank you. I'll tell Sadie you're okay. Thanks. I guess my disguise didn't work as well as I'd hoped. Do you think somebody killed Richard because they knew I was coming to ask questions? No no no. Hey! You don't put that on yourself, okay? John, if I'm responsible... Look, we don't know what happened here yet. Although my guess is whoever tried to scare you already killed one person, so they'd probably have done you in, if they wanted to. I blame myself. This is much more complex for you to take on as a first case. Yeah, you're probably right. I'm going to go back to Sadie's and get some rest. Okay, well, let me drive you then. No, no. I'm fine. Really. I've got my car. Just stay here and help them figure out what happened. -Thanks. -Yup. Sadie? Hey Sadie! I'm going to make some tea. Do you want some? Sadie! Oh no, no. Sadie! Sadie! I think we're going to need a bigger crime board. What happened? I was trying to add your attack and I couldn't reach. And as it turns out, ladders and heels is not a very good idea. You should not be climbing ladders in heels! You should not be meeting strangers alone. It's not safe. Sadie! Come here. Don't look at me like that. I have weak ankles! I am calling the doctor. Oh you sound just like my Harold. Always worried about me. He was always taking care of you. Yes. I miss him. Every day. I know. I thought something had happened to her. And I thought it was all my fault. Hey I'm sorry. But it sounds like she's going to be okay. I thought that whoever had come after me and Richard had come after Sadie too. If anything happened to her I would never forgive myself. Or to Lia. Look, I stationed an officer outside of Lia's place, just to be safe. And yours too. There's an officer outside? Yeah, just a precaution. Look, what you went through today must have been frightening. He's just there to monitor things and report any activity back to me. Why are you wasting an officer here? You should be off questioning Dwayne Wayne! Why would I do that? Because everything points back to Wayne! Wayne and his company stole Linda Martin's inheritance without a second thought. They caused her to lose everything! You need evidence, Jane. Fine. Better yet, I'll get a confession! Have you forgotten that you were attacked today? And that a brick was thrown through your window? So what do you want me to do? You want me to sit here and do nothing? I'm saying you're definitely not going to help solve Lia's case if something happens to you. I thought you were supposed to be helping me, John! You're just slowing me down. Well forgive me for caring. Thanks so much for meeting me today, Ms. Donnelly. I don't have long. I have a lunch at the Collingwood Club. The Collingwood Club? Isn't that the same facility where Linda wound up... Yes. I am lucky to still be a member there after what Linda pulled. Fortunately, enough time has passed that people are decent enough not talk about it. Sounds like it was a tragic event for a lot of people. My step-daughter's death was tragic, but honestly, it was inevitable. I did everything I could for her. Found therapist after therapist for her. But all she wanted to do was waste her money on more crystals. I told her that morning, "Linda, you need real help!" But she sure didn't need it from me. So, you saw her the day she died? She showed up at the club and made a scene at the end of my tennis class. It was so embarrassing! She was all sweaty and paranoid. She actually attacked me. Did she say anything to you? She mumbled some nonsense about some birdie. I don't know. Birdie? What do you think she meant by that? She never acted like the mother she was. I'm surprised she's not into unicorns, too. My friends are waiting for me at the club. Just one more question. Can you tell me about how Linda came in to her inheritance? Did Kenny Martin put you up to this? All he ever wanted was my money. He was always polite but I could see right through him. No, actually. It was your granddaughter, Lia. Step-granddaughter. Let me guess. She is after that inheritance now? No, she's actually after closure. Look, I've remarried, moved on. I don't have time in my life to worry about some money-hungry Martins. Linda never should've gotten that money in the first place. So that money was from your second husband? I am done answering your questions. I'm just trying to help. I told the police everything fifteen years ago. So I don't see the need to do it again with some stranger who's playing detective. Okay. Hey. Jane! How's the country club set? Well, to be honest I'm just trying to process what happened. Ella Donnelly totally ran the show. I was just trying to keep up. She seemed more concerned with her reputation at the Club than Linda's suicide. And at best, she is an uncaring stepmother, but at worst... I don't know. But when I mentioned the inheritance and Kenny, she was not happy. I didn't expect so much resistance from the family. It wouldn't be a hopeless case if it was going to be easy. I'm in way over my head here. Wayne Society, how may I direct your call? Yeah, I'd like to speak with Mr. Wayne please. And who may I say is calling? This is Jane Da Silv...erberg! I have a couple questions about Inner Inc. and a woman named Linda... The Wayne Society is in no way affiliated with Inner Inc. Mr. Wayne has no interest in hearsay. Okay. Fine. Understood. But may I speak with him? You'll have to book an appointment. All right, then I'd like to book an appointment. Mr. Wayne is fully booked until February of next year. Wow. Busy guy! What exactly does the Wayne Society do? We specialize in elite corporate training retreats for self-empowerment and increased productivity. So it's basically Inner Inc. without the crystals. Lia? What do you think? What do I think... You're okay? I won't be if I don't pick the right dress for graduation! My dad will totally ground me if he finds out I bought two. I just couldn't decide myself in the store. I love this one, but I feel like it's missing something. Well, I think this dress looks so beautiful on you. In fact, I think my aunt might have a few necklaces that would make it look stunning. Really? You'll have to come over and pick one out for yourself. Now, how are you thinking about doing your hair? I don't know. I'm not very good at doing my own hair. May I? I did learn a few quick tricks while I was performing in Europe. No way, you performed in Europe? What if we do it all up... Kind of a little princess thing at the top of it. You know what. I'm going to be right back. Okay? Kenny... I can explain. She looks so grown up. Yeah, she does. I know it's must have been hard on her... Growing up without her mom. I can never talk to her about dresses and stuff. Thanks. Thanks for that. Nothing can replace a mother, but... I'm just glad I could be here to help. Are you any closer to finding out what happened to Linda? I'm hopeful. The night before she died, Linda told me she was giving that money away. She refused to tell me who she was giving it to. All this after she had lost my savings to that scheme. I was hurt. Angry. And I said some terrible things. I've spent the last fifteen years thinking about how that crystal kook must have sweet-talked it out of her. But after all this time, me protecting Lia, not telling her the truth. I think I might be the bad guy. No, Kenny... The night Linda died she came home all upset. She said that I had a bad energy. She wanted a divorce. She was going to take Lia and leave. They were going to start a happy new life together without me. Well, what happened? Linda couldn't be trusted, not with our money, not with my heart, there was no way I was going to let her leave with our daughter. I wouldn't let her take Lia. Not how she'd been acting. Was she distressed? Yeah, she was upset. She was swearing that she could fix this, she could fix this. She left. She never came back. You know, when she left here, she intended on coming back to get Lia. She loved Lia so much. Maybe she didn't intend on killing herself that night. Find out, for Lia. For both of us. Jane! Look! I finished it! You look gorgeous! How do you feel? I love it! I think mom would too. I do too. Thank you. Oh! I'm sorry. I didn't realize there was a person behind that notebook. Yeah! It's just how I read. Oh. You know, you might want to get your eyes checked. -May I? -Yeah. So, you play the drums! Wait. But what does that mean? I've met a few drummers in my day. Ah, right. But, let me guess. None as cool as I am. No, not one. Seems you got a few tricks up your sleeve. Well, when work gets heavy, playing just clears my mind. Yeah, oh! I miss that. When I'm up on stage, all my problems just melt away. Exactly. Hey, do you want to get up there? Melt some problems away? I can ask the manager for you. No, not tonight. I'm in too deep with Linda's journals. Ah. Anything of interest? Mostly just nonsensical poems. It seems like a dream journal. She does mention this bird several times. I feel like there's something there, you know. I don't know, maybe it sounds crazy, but I'm just trying to pull all the pieces together. What? Now you're starting to sound like a real detective. Yeah, well, I'm starting to think that Uncle Harold was very rushed when he chose me to succeed him. Because I can't even clear one case. Come on. Harold must have known you have many qualities that would be perfect for the job. And as well, you've already impressed me a few times. Well, those were flukes! All of them! I don't know how Uncle Harold went about solving these cases. I'm trying to get a call through to Dwayne Wayne and I can't. Would like my advice? Don't worry about how Harold did it. Do it your own way. Care about the people involved. Keep on the case. Yeah. Thanks Detective. You're welcome. All right. Well... Look out Dwayne Wayne. Welcome to the Wayne Society. Do you have an appointment? Ah, no. Actually I don't. Mr. Wayne said I didn't need one. Mr. Wayne meets by... By appointment only, yes, I know, but due to the very urgent and financial nature of our business, he said I should come in right away. Of course. Excuse me just one moment. Of course. What did you say your name was? Ah, Melanie... Cameron. Yes! Reservations at the Collingwood Club tonight. Bingo! Perfect! Robin? Like the bird? Birdie! Mr. Wayne can't see you this morning. He has a prior engagement. Well, fine, fine! I will take my investments elsewhere then. Sadie! Do you have any contacts at the Collingwood Club still? I'm looking for a gig tonight. It all points to Wayne. Yes! Excuse me, Miss! -Me? -Yes. That was an exquisite performance! You have such command over your audience. Ah well, thank you! Would you care to join me for a drink? Don't mind if I do. Why haven't I seen you perform here before? Well, I'm new to town. Sort of. Jane Da Silva. And you must be Birdie. Birdie? No no. No, I'm Mr. Wayne. Oh, how funny! I could have sworn you that you were the pompous fraud who stole Linda Martin's inheritance. All right. First of all, you need to keep your voice down. No. No no no no. No. This has been kept silent long enough. I am here to right a wrong. And you need to answer for what you've done! I have admitted any wrongdoings concerning Inner Inc. And I've spent the rest of my life trying to make amends for that. You have never truly paid for all the lives that you ruined with your pyramid scheme. I did not start this journey of empowerment to take people's money! It was a life-changing movement. And it got bigger than I could have expected, yeah. And I lost control of the company. Those people trusted you. They believed in you. And you sold them lies. People needed something, anything to believe in. Now I kept that company going for them, for the believers. And that's exactly why you took Linda Martin's money. So that you could start a new business without your bad reputation. Who's Linda Martin? Linda Martin drowned on the evening of June 8th, here at the Collingwood Club in the pool. Well, that's tragic. It was a pool that you swam at every morning until the morning that she was discovered. Yeah. Because I was in Mexico. Hiding. -I knew it! -No! I was lying low while news of the rock scandal broke. It was the worst day of my life. Now look, you can check with my assistant. You can check with the airlines. You can check with the resort! I couldn't possibly have anything to do with that. Now listen, I don't know who you're working for, but you tell them my lawyers will be in touch. This is who I'm working for. Her! A young, bright and incredibly talented young woman who can only dream about attending Juilliard because her mom and her inheritance were stolen from her fifteen years ago. Obviously if someone had come to me in a desperate situation, I would have done my best to help them. So, you really don't know Linda Martin, do you? There were a thousand people at those conferences! I can't remember every photo op! I bid you good night. Don't touch me! Hi! Oh... Jane, John, what's wrong? What happened? There was an incident. But I caught the call and vouched for her, so they agreed to let her go home. You two should talk this out. I screwed up so bad Sadie. I made a huge mistake. I have no idea what I'm doing. You're being too hard on yourself! I accused an innocent man of robbery and murder! Oh, well... That isn't great. And Richard Florian would probably still be alive if it weren't for me. John was right. I am wasting the Foundation's time. Oh, Lia is going to be so disappointed. I don't know what I was thinking! I can't do any of this. I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm ruining Uncle Harold's legacy. And yet here you are, my dear. Harold was an investment banker. Who didn't know the first thing about investigation at first. But he found his own way to help. Lean into who you are, Jane. Lean into your natural talents. Tell me, why did you decide to work on this case? Because I wanted to help Lia. Because I like helping people. Yeah. And I like trying to make things right. And I am kind of curious. Pretty persistent. Your mother was too. And you're one amazing performer. I mean, ta-da! Yeah, I'm pretty good at that, aren't I. Yes you are! You take after me. Mrs. Florian? Yeah. I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you. How did you know Richard? Where did this come from? It was a commissioned painting Richard did years ago. He never liked it. He tried to throw it out once or twice, but I always loved it. Something so dreamy about it. Yeah. A birdie preaching rainbows. He developed a dream-like style over the years. It's beautiful. I feel like I've seen it somewhere else before. I'm so sorry. Bingo! Hmmm... Sadie was right. It does feel good. Linda Martin. I was the one who found her when I came into work. Really? It would not have been difficult for him to take advantage of her, in her delicate, impressionable state. Excuse me! I don't think she had an appointment either. Jane, this is my wife. -Cindy, right? The pool manager? -Yes, hi. Yeah, we had a little chat at the pool the other day. What a strange, small world. I am so sorry to interrupt but I am, I'm really struggling, doctor. I'm having hallucinations. Seeing things that aren't there. Thinking crazy thoughts. Oh. When did these symptoms arise? Just the other day, after I came to see you. My anxiety has been really overwhelming. Is there anything that you can give me to help that? Yeah. I could write you a prescription for an anti-anxiety medication. Could you? That would be great. Yeah. That is a beautiful painting. Yes. You mentioned that the other day when you were here as well. Has your memory always been so unreliable? You, know, I do remember now! I believe you said a client had painted it. He was a very talented artist. Lovely young fellow. Does he do commissions? Perhaps something with a bird? You'd have to ask him. I'd love to, but it turns out he was murdered in his studio recently. Oh. How tragic! Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting but you seem to be connected to a lot of people who've died under mysterious circumstances. You're very critical, Jane. I wonder if there's a way we could work together to find where that negativity is coming from. Don't gaslight me. The way you did Linda. Or Richard Florian. You made him think for years that he was crazy, that he needed group therapy. I think this little pseudo-investigation of yours is going straight to your head! You said it yourself. Linda was delicate, impressionable. She came to you for help and you made her worse! I think you need to call the police. There's a deranged woman here who needs an intervention. You made Linda keep this dream journal. And then you hired Richard Florian to paint the images. You made her think she was crazy. You made her paranoid! Why would I do that? Risk my practice, my good name? Hmm. I don't know. A quarter of a million dollars seems like a pretty good reason for a sociopath. And Cindy, right, she had access to the pool and the security footage. So... Not quite as chatty today, are you Cindy? It was pretty brilliant. A little complicated, but you got what you wanted, right? Nobody questioned Linda's instability. You walked away with the money and Inner Inc. was the perfect scapegoat. But I don't get it, why did you kill Linda? She wasn't supposed to be at the pool. Cindy! What? She wasn't! She was supposed to give you the money in the therapy session. Oh, so she disobeyed you? Good for her! So she had a change of heart and realized the safest place she could stash the money was in a locker at the pool. And then when she went back to get it for the sake of her daughter, you killed her for it. Linda was a distressed individual. There's no way she was capable of handling such a large sum of money. I was just trying to alleviate her anxiety. She had a daughter! A daughter that has to grow up without a mom, and without her rightful inheritance because you killed her. Now Jane, let's see what we can do about that anxiety. Is this how you killed Richard Florian? No. He didn't put up this much of a fight! Police! Oh, thank you! Thank you. This deranged woman, she's been stalking me. She attacked me and my wife! I think you're hallucinating, Dr. Hawthorne. I have everything recorded right here. Cuff him, guys. No no no no no. I can explain. You're going down for two murders today, Dr. Hawthorne. You have the right to remain silent... I got your text. Thanks. You okay? Yeah. You were right. Your mom was taken advantage of by some really selfish people. And I hate to have to tell you this, but the money is gone. But, I think it's really important that you know that your mom was trying to build a better life. Between the crystals and the therapy, she wanted to be better for herself and for you. She loved you so much. Hawthorne was supposed to be helping mom. How could he do that to her? Well, it seems that Dr. Hawthorne had been manipulating a lot of his clients over the years, under the guise of these new-age therapy techniques. But, it turns out he didn't care about their well being at all. He just wanted their money. It's pure greed. That's awful! But, because you called the Foundation, a lot of families have answers now. And you stopped Dr. Hawthorne from ruining more lives. Thank you for finding the truth, even if it wasn't good news about the inheritance. I knew in my heart that she wanted to be with me. That she loved me. But proof of that is helping to fill the hole she left with good feelings now. Thank you Lia, for bringing Jane in to help us. I know I shouldn't have hurt and worries about my Linda. If it wasn't for the Foundation, she would have never found justice. I love you, Dad. I love you too, sweetheart. I'm sorry when I pushed back at first. I was still hurting. But you were brave and strong, just like your mother. Thanks. You know, you're a pretty good dad. Yes I am. I owe you an apology too, for being difficult. I had my doubts at first, but you helped us so much. Thank you. You're welcome. And honestly, I had my doubts too. But it seems that Uncle Harold saw something in me that I didn't. I have one more request. Seeing as I won't be going to Juilliard yet and I'll be here at community college, I could really use a mentor for my music. Oh, please pick me! Jane, we have a guest! Ms. Da Silva. -Mr. Wayne. Hi. -Hi. Nice to see you. This, actually, is Linda Martin's family. This is Linda's daughter Lia. It's a pleasure to meet you. And Linda's husband Kenny. Nice to meet you. I was so sad to hear what happened to your mother. I know it was a lot of years ago, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. Thank you. Ms. Da Silva has made me aware of your talent and ambition. And since the Wayne Society believes in empowering others and supporting greatness and hard work, I'm here to offer you a full scholarship for all your musical endeavors. Oh yeah, and it's at Juilliard. Seriously? I think you're more than worthy of that distinction. Congratulations. Oh wow. Mr. Wayne, this is incredibly generous. Now, about these accusations made by the Foundation... Oh, I I I apologize, Mr. Wayne. I jumped to conclusions, and I acted entirely alone so please don't penalize the Foundation because of my actions. You may recall I made a few mistakes on my own back in the day. Maybe we all could use a second chance. Hear, hear! Thank you! I'm going to Juilliard! Yes you are! Congratulations. Well. Now we really do have something to celebrate! Wow! Stunning. Thank you. My Carnegie Hall dress! You wear it better than I ever did. Well, I doubt that. I've never seen you look anything less than gorgeous. Flattery will get you everywhere. Thank you for coming home, Jane. I miss Harold just the same but now I can laugh a little too. You brought the light back, Jane. You brought the light back for me too, Sadie. I feel closer to mom again. And not just thinking about the end, but the happy times too. They go together, don't they? Yeah, they do. All right! Show time! So, when are you thinking about going back to Paris? Ah, you know. Actually, I'm pretty happy right here. So no more floating around? I don't think so. It's kind of nice being connected. So you'll be staying home for awhile? Yeah. Maybe. Maybe I'll even lean into righting some more wrongs. Hmm. I like the sound of that.
