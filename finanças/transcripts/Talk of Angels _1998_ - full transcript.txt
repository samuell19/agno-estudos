[ dramatic theme playing ] [ men chattering in Spanish ] MARY: We came through a valley and into this great hubbub of noise. And for a minute I saw it all very clearly-- The family I was about to join, a country in turmoil and my own life turned upside down. And then I thought, it's why you came. It's what you wanted. And that's how it all began. [ man speaks Spanish ] [ people chattering in Spanish ] -Jaime. -Jaime, hello. That's the Areavagas now. It's nice to have a new face. As long as she's one of us. [ dogs barking ] [ speaks Spanish ] [ people speaking Spanish ] [ Don Jorge speaking Spanish ] Jaime! Jaime! [ Dona Consuelo speaking Spanish ] [ speaks Spanish ] My daughters are waiting to meet you. But first, you may unpack. MARY: When I entered that house I thought, perhaps they were right. They said I would regret it. [♪♪♪♪♪] Dearest Michael, I'm wondering if you're cross with me still. I keep thinking of how stern you looked and the way you wouldn't wave. But, Michael, people have to part if they are to be sure. This year is a test, a big test for us both. [ dogs barking ] But we will win through. And don't think I'm not lonely. -[ knocking on door ] -Come in. [ door opens ] These are your pupils. Pilar, my eldest daughter. Mila, my middle daughter. You will find that their spoken English is excellent. Their written English needs improvement. Yes, madam. Leonor, my little princess. She is too young to learn English. But in six months time, she will begin her studies. [ speaking Spanish ] DONA CONSUELO [ in English ]: Perhaps you should show Miss Maria around the house. What is that? It looks like dirt. It's clay from Ireland. When we go into exile, we carry some with us. Why? For luck. Is that your brother? No, it's, um-- It's just a friend. [♪♪♪♪♪] [ speaking Spanish ] [ bell clanging ] DR. VICENTE: Our Irish miss. I'm the father of your pupils. Dr. Vicente. You have come a long way, miss. I trust you'll be contented in our country. Thank you, sir. I'm sure I will. It's, uh, very beautiful here and so different. I'm afraid all this is very deceptive, miss, uh-- Lavelle. Sorry. Mary. Maria. Heh. [ pats seat ] Ah, these are troubled, sometimes dangerous times for our poor country. Sounds very much like home. But you're over your civil war, while we are still hovering on the brink. I know very little about Spain, but I'd like to learn. I'm tempted to tell you not to waste your time. What a dreadful thing to say. Heh. You sound just like my son, Francisco. Take no notice of a tired old man. If my small library is of any use, you're always welcome. Gracias. MARY: The letters from Michael reminded me of home, the family, our house. I could picture them on the farm at all hours. But I didn't want to be there. In the evenings by myself, I dreamt of all the things I'd loved to do-- dance, listen to flamingo, stay out all night-- things they wouldn't understand. As the days went by, I was fast becoming a part of this family, proper Spanish lady even, learning to use the fan and so on. But I had to remember I was still a governess. MARY: "It ran along on wheels--" [ clears throat ] "And no one present could believe "that it would ever rise from the earth. Full stop." I have to change before we leave. Shut up, Pilar. There is plenty of time. Could you repeat the last bit, Miss Maria? Yes, Mila. "That it would ever rise from the earth. Full stop." [ all chattering in Spanish ] [ in English ] Now, just wait one moment. Wait! We came in that direction. From there.[ speaking indistinctly ] [ clamoring ] ¿Que pasa? MARY: Let's get out of here. MARY: Stay close! Come on! [ Pilar screams ] [ shouting in Spanish ] [ woman screams ] MARY: Oh, no! Ah! [ neighs ] [ clamoring ] O'TOOLE: Here! Here! Come on, girls! Over here! Over here! Quick, quick, quick! MARY: Across the road. Come on. Come on! O'TOOLE: Come. Come on, come on. Good girl. -Good girl. Good girl. -[ speaks Spanish ] MARY: Will he be all right? Are you mad? MARY: Is he dead? [ women panting ] There's one big lesson you have to learn, Limerick. There are streets these girls cannot go into. -My name's O'Toole. -Mary Lavelle. Thank you. -Oh! Come on. -[ bell tolling ] Well, I must say, I've never seen anything quite like you before. -When's your afternoon off? -Wednesday. -Great. There will be loads of us there. -"Us"? What? You didn't think we were the only two? Wait there. Come on, lassies. It's all right now. It's safe now. Be brave soldiers' daughters. See you at the cafe on Wednesday. -MARY: See you then. -[ speaking Spanish ] For now, then. -MARY: Come on. -O'TOOLE: Go. MARY: Now, hear. Stay close. -MILA: She's nice. -MARY: Yes, she's very nice. MARY: Now, come on. Let's get you home. MARY: So you have forgiven me. The girls wanted to read your letter, but I wouldn't let them. Michael, this country is as bad as our own was. I saw a man dying today. I felt awful not going to him. You must learn something quickly. Spain is a dangerous country. No one is safe. We could lose everything we own. My husband laughs at this. He has a romantic view of the poor. My son, Francisco, he's the same. I do not share their views. These people could murder us in our beds. If you cannot always be on your guard, you must leave. -Do you understand that? -Yes. MARY: Why had he married her? They differed about everything. She sided with the church and fascists. He was the opposite. He was gentle, an outsider, and he knew it. [ speaking Spanish ] Mila. [ belches ] [ speaking Spanish ] [ speaking Spanish ] Buenas noches, mi hija. [ speaking Spanish ] Si, senor. MARY [ in English ]: Elena, what's wrong? Shh. Elena? [ glass clinking ] Hello. MAN: No! Jaime? Jaime, is that you? -No, thank you, miss. -Sweet Jesus! [ speaks indistinctly ] -[ groaning ] -You're hurt! -Jesus, I'm sorry! -No, no, no, no. It's the vino. Heh. Shh! Shh! It's all right. Esta bien.MARY: I'm sorry. I was looking for Elena, and I heard a noise. [ groaning ] [ speaking Spanish ] Gracias. [ in English ] Please, mention this to no one, not even my family. His life depends on it. You have lived through a war. You know when to keep silent. Yes. It must be our secret. [♪♪♪♪♪] That's father there and there with the salute. And he wrote books. That, and that, and that, and that too. Mila's passion is politics, Miss Maria. I'm sorry for that. What I had to say was barely worth putting on paper. But I did. Have you chosen a book yet? Not yet. So? Poetry or prose? -MARY: I don't know. Let's have a look. -Poetry. [ whispers ] This. -[ reading in Spanish ] -"The Faithless Wife." -Come here. -Please, sit down. [ reading in Spanish ] MARY: I remember the words were but lost on me. I wanted to tell Mila how lucky she was. I wish my father had read me poetry. [ speaking Spanish ] Si. This is for you, Miss Maria. From now on, I'll be your Spanish miss. Gracias, Mila. [ car horn honks ] WOMAN: Well, what's she like? She's hardly more than a girl herself. So young. Too thin. -But beautiful, waifish. -Can she teach? O'TOOLE: I don't know. WOMAN: Why did that family choose so young a girl? O'TOOLE: That's the thing of it. They didn't choose her at all. Some limerick convent sent her unseen. She sounds very unsuitable, doesn't she? Hello. -This is Lavelle! -No. -This is Harty. -Hello. -Keough. -Hello. -And Duggan. -How do you do? -How do you do? -Sit down, darling. Wee cup of tea? What do you think of our little corner of Ireland, daughter? -It seems very nice. -Uh-huh. How are they treating you? -Are they giving you ham and eggs for breakfast? -No. I thought not. They think they're something because they've money. We all come from as good back in Ireland. Yes, ham and eggs. Now, insist upon it. Ham and eggs, or they walk over you. Take your hat off and give us a look at you. Why, you're a beautiful young girl! O'TOOLE: She is, indeed! I'll buy her some tea. Um, garcon! Waiter! The very man. Now, tea for cinq. -Cinco! Cinco tes! -[ all chattering ] -Thank you. -Do you speak much Spanish? I've only been here five years, you know. We don't have to know it. All we've got to do is speak English. Conlon speaks, of course. She's, um, not like the rest of us. -Thanks be to God! One of her sort is enough! -Yeah. -Talk of angels. -Buenas tardes. Hello. Buenas tardes. Un cortado, por favor. This is Lavelle, the Areavagas' new governess. -Hello. -Hello. -Gracias. -De nada. Will you not eat one of these, Miss Conlon? Isn't she a sight for sore eyes amongst the likes of us? Look your fill, then. You won't have her long to comfort your sore eyes. You see? She thinks she knows everything. Why did you say that? What do you think you were hired for? To take the shine from the lustrous Pilar? You can disguise yourself any way you like. When you're around, no one will be looking at her. I don't understand. I'm here to teach English, not to go into society. Listen, Dona Consuelo is a realist. She flew high, and her son and daughters are to fly higher. She'll be sending you home soon. Now you know what Conlon's like. [ children singing in Spanish ] Francisco! Francisco! [ speaks Spanish ] Francisco! [ speaking Spanish ] Francisco! -[ door opens ] -[ man, child speaking Spanish, laughing ] -MAN: Bueno, Francisco! -[ child laughing ] [ speaking Spanish ] No. [ speaks Spanish ] [ humming ] [ piano continues ] [ ends on declarative note ] No! No, no, no, no, no. [ speaking Spanish ] No, no, no, no. [ resumes playing ] [ ends on declarative note ] MILA [ speaking Spanish ]: Muy bien. Si, buena. -[ in English ] For you. -[ in English ] Thank you. What's wrong? You look worried. I've been thinking about your music lesson. Is Don Jorge always so familiar? Yes. Always. Have you never thought of telling your mother? -No. -Why ever not? Because he's a priest, Miss Maria. Well, what about your father? I couldn't speak to my father about things like that. Well, I really think that I should talk to your mother about it. He's a priest. And you should not make an enemy of the priest. [ both speaking Spanish ] -Sorry to disturb you, Dr. Vicente. -Ah, Maria. Please, ask my son-- who assures me that fascism is knocking at our door-- how he now reconciles himself to extremism. You know damn well. The army is not going to wait quietly in the wings forever. One of these days they'll be standing with a gun at all our heads. You think I don't know that? Even the intellectuals are dabbling with dictatorship these days. I'm sorry. I lost my temper. It's just this place. It seems so far from reality. Quite. By the way, there is a wounded man hiding in our barn. He claims you're a friend of his. -Pablo? -He's been asking for ya. [ laughs ] Well, obviously Irish people are good at keeping secrets. I have to go. I have to see him. So, Maria? This is all very difficult for me. I don't really know where to start. [ both speaking Spanish ] [ speaking Spanish ] [ stammers ] Vicente. [ both speaking Spanish ] Gracias. -[ chattering in Spanish ] -Beatriz! Beatriz! This is Miss Maria, the best governess we've ever had. [ Mary laughs ] Mila. Beatriz, por favor. FRANCISCO [in English]: Miss Maria, my wife, Beatriz. How nice to meet you, my dear. Please. Tell me, are you very homesick in this strange country of ours? No, Dona Beatriz. I'm very happy here. Hm. She's speaking up for Spain. Bravo! Bravo! Beatriz cannot find immediate fault. [ laughing ] Unfortunately, I've never been to Ireland. I believe it is very beautiful and the people charming. MARY: Thank you. [ speaking Spanish ] -Gracias. -De nada. Miss Maria, listen to this. [ chattering in Spanish ] -[ tango music playing over speaker ] -Ahh! Yay! [ speaking Spanish ] Your poet Yeats is a great favorite of mine. How wise that your country made him a senator. My husband thinks you should not have signed a treaty that allowed the British to stay. But he has a taste for extreme solutions. -[ speaking Spanish ] -[ giggling ] That is the man who would have us believe he knows several ways to save Spain. [ speaking Spanish ] [ in English ] Are you political, my dear? Is your family political? [ speaking Spanish ] So? No, but I like Yeats. Why? Because when he loves, it is for life. -Is that wise? -Yes, I think. How beautifully you speak. Soft, pure, with that strange nuance that is never in English. Tell me. Is it true what I've heard about the Irish? Do they never say what they mean? [ Francisco speaking Spanish ] [ tango music playing ] [ man singing in Spanish ] [ speaking Spanish ] [ laughs ] [ in English ] Miss Maria? May I come in? Please, do! I would like to apologize for Beatriz's behavior. I hope she hasn't upset you. I seem to be able to offend everyone these days. Well, she's angry at me, and she took it out on you. It wasn't fair. It's forgotten. She's very beautiful, your wife. Yes. When we were growing up, she was considered the most beautiful girl in the north of Spain. Everyone assumed we would marry and be a very glamorous couple. Now, look at us. [ scoffs ] Our perfect world is collapsing. And Beatriz doesn't understand why. Well, I'm not sure I can understand it myself. It's quite complicated. Right now, the fascists and the army are plotting with Franco to run the country by dictatorship. Thank you. They're gaining a strong support from the rich upper class, who foolishly believe that he will protect their wealth and their way of life. Nothing good can come of this. What about your friend, Pablo? Pablo is taking on the fascists. He's fighting for freedom. My wife refuses to believe that we are threatened. If she ever found out that I've helped Pablo, she would be furious. Perhaps she's afraid of the danger to you and the family. Maybe she doesn't know where to turn. No one knows where to turn. My father told me always to stand up for what I believe. But even he has lost his way in this fight. I only know that I cannot stand by and watch my country being destroyed by people who want power at any price. [ scoffs ] I'm sorry if I burden you with my problems. It's no burden at all. I've seen this kind of turmoil back home. I know what it's like. But the problems in Ireland seem simple by comparison. Were you thinking of your home? Yes, I was missing it a little. Well, I have to get back to the party. I wish you sweet dreams. -Night. -Good night. -BEATRIZ: Oh! [ laughs ] -PILAR: Beatriz! Beatriz! [ both speaking Spanish ] Adios. [ speaking Spanish ] CHILDREN: Beatriz! Beatriz! [ speaking Spanish ] [ speaking Spanish ] Did ever you see such a pretty creature? "Pretty" isn't quite the word. Do you know, you're right. She is drop-dead gorgeous! It's a shame to try and turn her into a miss. In what other job would she have such a comfortable existence just because she's Catholic and can speak a fair representation of the English language? It's jam for the stupid. Speak for yourself, Conlon, darling. You're very hard on our profession. I'd hardly call it a profession. If you think that cigarette can't be seen, you're a greater fool than I took you for. Oh, sure. If it isn't the infant herself! Yoo-hoo! Ahh! A vision in blue! -[ laughs ] -So, where are we going? I think, a little window-shopping. Come on. Were you ever in love, yet? Oh, I don't know. Were you? Oh, God help us, daughter! What do you take me for? Was I ever in love? Sure. What do you think has kept me alive in this rotten old world? -Why aren't you married then? -Oh, now that's a long story. That's several long stories. Do you know I'm gasping for a cigarette? I'll get some from Carlos. [ men speaking Spanish ] CONLON [ in English ]: Ah, go for the Pueblo. [ laughs ] So that's why he's turned up. -Who? -Francisco Areavaga. -He's resigned. -What? Seems he's been fraternizing with anarchists. The government probably sacked him. Dona Consuelo will be raging. -[ Conlon speaks Spanish ] -[ Carlos laughs ] Aren't you running your credit too high? I pay on the first. He doesn't mind. -Let me get the cigarettes. -I will not! The sooner you learn the ways of our life, the better, my girl. -Gracias, senor. -Hasta luego. [ arguing in Spanish ] MOTHER: Mila! [ all speaking Spanish ] Francisco! [ lively chattering ] It's shocking. Shocking! They were making suggestions. -DUGGAN: Lewd suggestions! -I wish I'd been here. Lewd suggestions in Spanish! -You don't speak Spanish. -I know a lewd suggestion when I hear one. -Good for you, Duggan. -Going to the bullfight. -Oh, dear God, the very idea! -It's disgusting! No, you're wrong. The bullfight is as heartrending as the greatest poetry. It is also as brutal and shameless as the lowest human impulse. Nothing else gives you that in the one movement. It's immense. It must be faced. Come to the bullfight with me, Lavelle. Yes, I think I will. [ crowd applauding, shouting ] [ dramatic theme playing ] CROWD: Iole! Iole! Iole! [ crowd chanting indistinctly in Spanish ] CROWD: Iole! Iole! Iole! [ crowd chanting ] [ crowd cheering ] [ dramatic theme playing ] [ children chattering in Spanish ] [ seagulls squawking ] Oh, no! Gracias. [ in English ] Their hearts are light. Tell me, Miss Maria, do you think they will find love for life? I hope so, sir. [ chuckles ] Is that why you came to Spain? They all made a terrible thing of it back home, and I didn't know at all how to explain it. And they're all waiting for me to fall flat on my face. Tell me about your home, Miss Maria. MARY: Ireland... is still in shock from the civil war. From all the wars. Ireland is struggling to make sense of itself. I think sometimes that struggle will never end. Welcome to Spain, Maria. Welcome home. "Come live with me and be my love, -and--" -[ laughing ] "And we will all the pleash--" -Pleasures. -"Plea-sures prove "by shallow rivers, to whose falls "melodious birds sing madrigals. "And I will make thee beds of roses "and a thousand fragrant posies; "A gown made of the finest wool, "which from our pretty lambs we pull; "Fur-lined slippers for the cold, "with buckles of the purest gold. "And if these pleasures may thee move, "come live with me and be my love." [ clears throat ] Excellent. Thank you. [ tango music playing in distance ] [ man speaking Spanish in distance ] -[ giggling ] -[ chattering in Spanish ] [ playing traditional Spanish patriotic music ] [ speaking Spanish ] I looked everywhere. Then I remembered Mila saying you sometimes watch the dancing. Would you dance with me? [ both nervously chuckle ] I have to go away tomorrow to Madrid. I had to see you again first. I'm glad. So, will you dance with me? [ laughs ] -Very good. -Thanks. [ applause ] [ music slows ] When the music stops, we must say good-bye. I know. [ song ends ] [ applause ] Mary! Mary! You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Disgracing us all like that! It is not done! It is simply not done! -A governess, dancing-- -With a man! -A married man! -The son of your employer! Well, girls. What do you think of the hat? When I bought it, I didn't know whether to wear it or eat it! It's idiotic. That one was seen dancing-- -With a man! -A married man. Who do you want her to dance with, a parrot? Would you two both leave? Leave now. Come on, child. We'll go and see if Conlon has risen from her grave. [ bell tolling ] O'TOOLE: You'll have to come in if you want to smoke. MARY: Why? Because you're a governess now. Ladies don't smoke in public. Are they giving you ham and eggs for your breakfast? Has Harty told you to insist on bacon and eggs? -She has. -O'TOOLE: Poor old Harty. Still, it would be nice to go home. -I'd murder a plate of bacon and eggs. Would you? -Mmm. I always loathed bacon and eggs. When will you go home? God knows. I haven't the fare. I'll never have it. -Never? -No, daughter. My sentence here is for life unless love comes along with a capital "L." ♪ In the field down by ♪ ♪ The river ♪ ♪ My love and I did stand ♪ ♪ And on my Leaning shoulder ♪ ♪ She laid her Snow-white hand ♪ ♪ She bade me Take life easy ♪ ♪ As the grass grows On the weir ♪ ♪ And I was young ♪ ♪ And foolish ♪ ♪ And now-- ♪ I'm full of tears. [ car horn honks ] Ah, Miss Maria. Ladies. You are going somewhere with your friends? To say a prayer to the virgin. Very nice. How are my charming little musicians? They're very well, thank you, Don Jorge. Give them my greetings, if that is permissible. Enjoy your afternoon. Thank you, Father. Do you sometimes dance in the square, Miss Maria? No? No, of course not. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, father. O'TOOLE: He's a bad article. I did not like the cunning look in his eyes. O'TOOLE: He hasn't any hold over ya, has he, daughter? MARY: No. Why should he? MARY: No one in the world knew that I only thought of Francisco and that dance in the square. And what could I say to God? Let me see him one more time. [ dramatic theme playing ] -Do you know what, daughter? -What? Well, excuse me if I'm wrong, but something struck me about you for the very first time that never struck me before. What's that? That you're in love. God help ya. Have I put my foot in it? No, you haven't. I am engaged to be married. Oh. I'm sure that's it then. Of course! How is it I never noticed the symptoms until today? What are the symptoms? Oh, don't ask me, daughter. I'm getting old. -What's he like? -What's who like? Go way out of that. The best beloved. Why didn't you tell us about him sooner? Why, in the name of God, did you come all this way away from him? Well, I'm away, girls. No one's stopping ya. O'TOOLE: That's a fact. She's up to something, that one. Why shouldn't she be? I like her. I noticed that. The tide's out. Shall we walk for a bit? Yes, I'd like that. MARY: Can I ask you a question? Have you ever had a crush on anyone? CONLON: No! I've never had a crush on any living creature. What's your name? -Agatha. -[ chuckles ] -It's a vile name. -No, it isn't. I hate the surname Habit. May I call you Agatha? I told you a lie just now. About your name? No. I said I'd never had a crush on any living creature. That was true, up to the first day I saw you. Oh, Agatha, I'm sorry. How long will you stay out here? I don't know. A year, at the most. I'd like to be your friend. Listen. I saw you dancing with him in the square. Just be very careful. DR. VICENTE: Come in. MARY: Dr. Vicente. DR. VICENTE: I've something to ask you, Miss Maria. The girls are to go to their aunt in Madrid. Pilar is determined to wear nothing but the most beautiful dresses when she goes into society. So, she must go to Madrid. Mila will go with her. Where Mila goes, she insists you go. May I persuade you to go with them? Oh, I'd love to go to Madrid. So, you are not yet tired of our poor country? Oh, no. The more I see, the more it interests me. Mila says you used to publish essays on Spain. Would you permit me to read some? [ chuckles ] Those times are long past, Miss Maria. I've grown to prefer the refuge of dreams. Those dreams made me enemies, not the least among my own class. I believe I'm referred to in some quarters as a traitor. I won't corrupt you with my dangerous dreams. If you'll excuse me, sir. Where were we? PILAR AND MILA: He was just about to leave. "Patrick strapped his gun belt beneath his coat. "He kissed his wife Geraldine good-bye. "They stood there looking at each other for a moment "in the half light at the hallway "and tried to banish from their mind the thought that this spring night "might be their last "and their sleeping daughter would wake without a father. "He slipped out the front door and moved through the Dublin night "toward the place of rendezvous. "His revolver snug against his breast. "A street from the post office, "he ducked beneath the British soldiers' line of fire. "There was a noise. He turned. A gunshot rang out." [ dramatic theme playing ] MARY: The girls were so excited. Aunt Cristina was a favorite of theirs. They haven't stopped talking about her and felt sure I would like her too. Mila wanted me to love Madrid as much as she did, but I didn't feel at ease there. I knew I would see Francisco. And the thought terrified me. -[ knocking on door ] -MILA: It's me, Miss Maria. May I come in? Yes. I just wanted to say thank you for a lovely day. Francisco's taking us to the party. Would you come and say hello to him? I can't, Mila. Look at me. [ Mila and Francisco speaking Spanish ] Do you think Spain is having an effect on you? I don't know. What do you think? I think it's changing you. [ sighs ] It will be better if it didn't. I mean, it will be much easier for you, wouldn't it? Go, Mila. Enjoy your party. Go on. -Good night, Miss Maria. -Good night. -[ crowd shouting ] -MILA: This is The King's Park. [ crowd chanting ] [ speaking Spanish ] Mila! Miss Maria, come and look. Quickly! Look! MARY: Mila, wait! If you want to go watch, you wait for me, all right? [ chattering in Spanish ] [ Mila approaching, chattering in Spanish ] [ in English ] Oh, I'm so sorry, Miss Maria. -Are you all right? -I'm fine. Yeah? These street disturbances are so very annoying. My husband thinks I take politics too lightly. But unlike him, I'm not obsessed by the thought of a fascist coup. And these fascists will protect people like us, don't you think? -Adios. -Please, sit down. PILAR: Well-- I just hope nothing is going to spoil our last two days. -Last two days? -Yes. Tomorrow and the day after. That will be quite enough for Aunt Cristina. [ speaks Spanish ] Pablo. [ all speaking Spanish ] FRANCISCO [ in English ]: I'm sorry to spoil the party, Miss Maria. I hope we meet again very soon. Hasta luego, guapitas. So full of secrets, my dear husband. [ man speaking Spanish ] [ crowd lively chattering ] [ crowd responds positively ] [ horse neighs ] [ chanting in Spanish ] [ gunshots ] [ yells in Spanish ] [ all clamoring ] [ playing gentle piano composition ] -[ explosion in distance ] -[ screams ] [ chattering in Spanish ] MILA [ in English ]: Francisco's in the street alone! MARY [ in English ]: Come away from the window! [ gunfire ] I'll go to Aunt Cristina's and tell her the girls are with you. The streets are not safe. You should not go out. I insist. I'll be very careful. [ gunshots continue ] [ speaking Spanish ] [ speaking Spanish ] Pablo! Pablo! -[ dogs barking ] -[ speaks indistinctly ] [ Pablo grunts in pain ] [ soldiers ordering in Spanish ] [ shouting continues ] -You're safe. -I was so worried. What happened to you? I had to tell Aunt Cristina that the girls were safe with Beatriz. The telephone had been cut. I knew that she'd be worried. But I came here last night and there was no sign of you. -Where did you go? -I got lost in the mayhem. And then I saw Pablo. I just began to panic. -I went looking for you. -You went in the streets? It was chaos. You could have been hurt! I know, but, well-- I was worried about you. I had to do something. Then when I couldn't find you, I came back to Cristina's. Oh, Mary. I was doing the same. I was looking for you. We're safe. -There is no danger anymore. -[ sighs ] Are you sure? They cleared the streets, and the people have gone home. Come with me. -What, now? -Mm-hm. I would like to take you somewhere special. What will I tell the girls? Today is your day off, isn't it? No? Yes. It's your day off. Let's go. MARY: On the way to the mountains, he told me he was going to join Pablo and fight fascism. "What about your family?" I said. He had not told them yet. He was telling me. MARY: You know nothing about me really, do you? -So what does it matter? -Well, it does matter. You're Spanish, and you're married. And you're Irish and teaching English to my little sisters. And you have kindness and you care for those you love. -You didn't know that I was engaged. -What? To a man who believes in me completely. Do you love him? [ sighs ] He loves me. It's so beautiful here. We could be standing on top of the world. I suspect my father felt the same thing. He came here often when he was writing. I think he must have felt free in this place. I wish I could feel the same. Why do you say things like that? Because my family expects me to have honorable standards, and I can't always say what I feel. MARY: There's really no excuse for unhappiness. We're lucky we're here. [ rock clattering ] [ Francisco speaking Spanish ] -[ speaking Spanish ] -[ laughs ] MARY [ in English ]: Was that Spanish? I couldn't understand a word of it. FRANCISCO [ in English ]: Yes, it was a local dialect. [ speaking Spanish ] [ laughs ] -What did he say? -He wants to sing to us. -Let's hear him. -You want-- [ speaking Spanish ] [ singing in Spanish ] [ speaking Spanish ] [ laughs ] [ responds in Spanish ] FRANCISCO: Gracias. I keep thinking of the lies that will start tomorrow and stretch back to Ireland. Come. I would like to show you something. The Hermitage of the Holy Angels, my father's favorite place. I can never decide whether your father has very little faith in life or very much. Doesn't know, I imagine. He's a dreamer. He gave me this postcard as a child. I promised I would come here one day. Come! Look. It's beautiful. Beautiful. [ dramatic theme playing ] Stay with me. I can't. You know I can't. "For life, Francisco." MARY: You're asking me to believe in miracles. No. Just in love. You don't know. She doesn't know. How could she know? Lavelle's been in Madrid. -Know what? -It's O'Toole. She's gotten married. Married! I don't believe it! It is absolutely disgusting. What on earth is disgusting about O'Toole getting married? Oh! Congratulations, Carlos. Gracias. -Did she ever pay her bill? -Every penny. O'TOOLE: I'm in here! Come in and stop spreading scandal about me. Carlos, you mind the shop. Ooh. Thanks, pet. -Cheers, daughter. -Cheers. -Get that into ya. -Well, I hope you'll be really happy. -You and Carlos. -Thanks, darling. May your heart always be as beautiful as yourself. You know, I will never get the hang of these all-day stews. He'd be dead within the year of indigestion. God help him. I wonder, now, how much would I get for the shop? God forgive me. [ chuckles ] You're looking a bit drawn, daughter. What's ailing you? Nothing. Is it the heart? Is that chap at home causing you any worry? None at all. Oh, Mary! Darling girl, believe an old, married woman. Love is life. Aw. Aw, angel. [ speaking Spanish ] [ door thumps; footsteps approaching ] [ in English ] You want to leave? Yes. I must go home. [ sighs ] Mila will be heartbroken. Sorry. Won't you tell me what's wrong? I wish I could. MARY: I knew what was wrong. To break hearts, to break up a family-- That's what was wrong. We never get what we most want in life. We're shown it, but we do not get it. -Hello. -Come in. I've got something for you. Come here. It's a little scruffy, but it's the most precious thing I have. I'd like you to have it. Don't go. I've been so happy since you came, Miss Maria. [ sobbing ] We will do anything if you will stay. Please. [ Don Jorge speaking Spanish ] [ line ringing ] [ phone ringing ] Si. [ speaking Spanish ] Ah. Padre? Que pasa, Padre? [ Dr. Vicente speaking in Spanish ] [ phone clatters in cradle ] Why go back? [ sighs ] To explain. I owe that to Michael. I can't simply be passed from father to husband. -Will you ever leave? -Never. People don't like me, but I teach English better than the others. So-- You go tomorrow. Yes. Agatha, lend me your room, please. Thank you. Why didn't you tell me that you were leaving? We agreed in Madrid that we only had that one day. We agreed to nothing. Mary, I'm going to tell my father about us. He'll understand how we feel. -[ loud knocking ] -[ dogs barking ] [ knocking continues ] [ whispering loudly in Spanish ] [ knocking continues ] Vicente! No, no! Vicente! No! No-- [ engines revving ] [ engines revving ] [ vehicles departing ] Pablo. [ gunshot ] [ Dona Consuelo shuddering, gasping ] [ dramatic theme playing ] I've come to say good-bye to you now. Thought a lot about my life since I came to Spain. I never expected to love you. Then stay with me. Do you remember that day when you tried to explain to me what was happening here? Yes. Well, I didn't understand it the way I do now. What does that have to do with us? Others need you more than I do. Can't afford to be selfish. I love you. I'll never forget you. [ footsteps departing ] [ speaks Spanish ] Why are you crying? You hardly knew the man. I'm not crying for him. It's because of her. Why her? She's going home to Ireland. She can go home. [ dramatic theme playing ] [ train whistle blowing ] [ lively chattering ] I'm scared. Do you think they'll find me changed at home? Of course, they'll find you changed. You've learned more in the past few months than you could've in a lifetime on some sleepy Irish farm. I feel unsure. I don't want to get on that train. Listen to me, Mary. Don't start to doubt yourself. Your life is not over. It's just beginning. You have everything to live for. And you deserve to be as happy as you can be. Miss Lavelle. I've been meaning to give you something. You're the proper Spanish lady now. Mary, it's beautiful. Go on now. You'll miss the train. Oh, God, I hate good-byes. -Good-bye. -Bye-bye. -So long. -So long. Oh, God. [ dramatic theme playing ] [ whistle blowing ] MARY: I knew I would never see any of them again and everything seemed lost to me. Above all, him. But in that moment, I understood it was a journey that had to be. I know now it has made all the difference. [ dramatic theme playing ] [ dramatic theme playing ]
