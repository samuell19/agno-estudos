Diary of a Lost Girl was drastically shortened and altered due to censorship. In 1997, a reconstruction and photochemical restoration of the originally intended version was put together by the Fondazione Cineteca di Bologna, das Deutsche Filminstitut - DIF, Frankfurt am Main, and the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Murnau-Stiftung, Wiesbaden. It is based on a dupe-negative from the Danish Film Institute, Copenhagen. Most of the missing scenes were added from a contemporary print from the Archivo Nacional de la Imagen- Sodre, Montevideo. The reconstruction of the cut shown at the original screening was based on a comparison of the surviving prints of the movie as well as the censorship records at the Filmoberprüfstelle Berlin. The wording of the German intertitles was reconstructed with the help of German-French intertitles in a print at the Cinémathéque Royals de Belgique, Brussels. The typography was modeled on several surviving German titles found in a print at the Archivo Nacional de la Imagen-Sodre, Montevideo. The master negative of this version was the basis for the digitization in 2K. Within the HD-resolution, substantial damage to the images such as deterioration of the source material was retouched as much as possible.

Countess Thymian Osdorff, that's your new image!” “As holder of the right to first exercise your ownership stake in the pharmacy, will you truly not refrain from... evicting the poor widow of your friend?” “Countess, Mr. Meinert will release the share of the mortgage that you inherited from your mother to the amount of 45,000 marks... thereby becoming sole owner of the pharmacy. Here is the money.” “Filthy whore!” “The money! Where is all that money?” “I gave it to my little sister, lest she suffer the same fate as l.” “And I? Am I to blame for his demise?” “I must blame myself as his uncle. I shouldn’t have disowned this helpless boy.” “May I attempt to right the wrong I did to him by helping you?” We are now in Swinemünde. Uncle Osdorff is so charming. I feel as if my former life were nothing more than a bad dream. “Cousin Osdorff!” “My niece, Countess Osdorff.” “Little Thymian, don't you remember me?” “My dear Countess, please allow me to offer you my protection.” “I'd like to- We must leave here.” “Dear Countess, we'd like to invite you to join us in our Society for the Support of Troubled Young Women.” The Society for the Support of Troubled Young Women cordially invites Countess Thymian Osdorff to a board meeting and walk-through of our facility on August 19, 1929.
