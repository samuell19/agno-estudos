Your first time with a woman Oh, well... It doesn't matter You were good... perfect And me? Great... You know that Enough... - The food, sir - Leave it outside Finished? Can't I see? Don't be impatient Satyr Now you'll see! - Come on, put me down - NO chance There We got one It's beautiful Beautiful. A female 1621 to 1665 He died young What did he die of? Who's this? And that one? And that? - Do you know? - No ma'am This is very old family - Why no women's portraits? - They're in the basement In the basement? Where are your family's women? - What? - Their portraits All in the basement Well, I didn't put them there Even if they're dead, I demand they be revived - I'm hungry - It's an hour before dinner Perfect, I thought so Time for everything The roses In spring, only roses of the flesh shall flourish - You know who said that? - You It's me! Where are you? Can you hear me? - What are you doing? - Come up here - You saw her? - Who? - The bride - What bride? I was looking at you. Come up Let me go! Come on, don't be silly I don't want to Oh, really...! Open it, Susan Why are you doing that? The girl... - It was his grandfather - Who told you? I asked mum His wife wanted to kill him She poisoned his food He found out and she ran away to Paris Did your mom tell you that? I heard it at school. Everyone knows it It's just a story It's true, that's why all the women's portraits... were taken to the basement Keep still Do you like being hurt? What makes you think that? NO one has hurt me Here it is, it's finished Do I look like that, really? You're much prettier - It's yours - Can I really keep it? - Are they really in the basement? - Yes, they are It's me What was so funny? Do you know who she was? If you knew, you wouldn't laugh Susan, come with me I'll tell you about Mircala Karstein This place... it's magical Hollow Yes, like a tomb Mircala Karstein The woman in the portrait? I guess so - Someone in your family? - Sort of Your name's not Karstein She never took her husband's name - She killed him on her wedding night - Why? The legend says... he tried to make her do indecent acts Indecent? What kind of things? Nobody knows It was never revealed A shame, it would have been the best part of the story How did she die? She didn't die She was found, dressed as a bride... blood spattered beside her dead husband Eyes open, rigid, with warmth still in her body It was 2 years before they buried her Still with the dagger in her hand She was beautiful, of course, as often in these tales And is she... still there? I doubt it. Almost 200 years have passed The grave has been violated dozens of times But let's see Maybe it's the delicate forearm of Mircala What's wrong? It's my fault, I'm sorry Cemeteries, decay... it upsets me Why should that scare you? You're alive Alive No? Not now - Are you sure? - Please You look like a puppy waiting to be fed To eat, you must learn how women are All or nothing And now it's nothing? That's it Take it It's yours now Let's seal our covenant with a kiss There's someone under the bed - Susan - Don't touch me There's no one here, ma'am, it was just a dream I saw it I saw it with my own eyes Look! There's nothing there Get her a hot drink. With some brandy I can stay with her, or maybe Carol? No need Can you bring me the red capsules from the cupboard Yes, sir DO you feel better? Please, Susan We all have our fears, there's no need to dwell on them I'm sorry - I want to get away from here - Get away? But Why? You were happy this morning - I had a horrible dream - Exactly It was nothing but a nightmare - It wasn't a dream - Then what was it? A woman came in this room I saw her She talked to me And left this Listen In dreams, the subconscious chooses themes... normally prohibited by their moral code They often feel hatred or murderous thoughts... towards people who, in real life, they feel affection for These manifestations confirm the wisdom of Plato, when he said: The good are those who are content to dream... what the wicked actually practice Jung says, some dreams don't belong to the dreamer Inherited dreams Collective ancestral inhibitions... which surface even in morally healthy people What's all that to do with the dagger? Nothing Nightmares are the expression of powerful desire... which is being rejected or repressed There is in women an aggressive tendency... when they face the loss of their virginity... an event of great importance... which is for her both desirable and abhorrent Some experts call it "the Judith Complex" Rubbish Why keep such horrible books? - When did you read this? - IhavenW This is the first time I've ever seen it Come in Excuse me, sir, ma'am Come in Carol wants to say... she put the dagger in the bed Come here, Carol Is that true, was it you? - Where did you get it? - From a lady in the woods You didn't tell me about any lady - What lady? - The one in a wedding dress She told you to put it in the bed? She said to give it to Susan - Did you go into the room? - Yes - You put it in the bed? - NO She's lying, sir - Where did you put it? - On the table It was her, sir She found it in the woods and put it on the bed She's afraid to tell the whole truth You won't get into trouble It's a little imaginative, but mostly true Well then, it's all fine That's it Well, I think that explains it all Explains what? Not very reassuring Neither the aggressiveness of virgins, nor Carol's story You still want to leave? Tell me you don't want to leave And you'll forget your fears and nightmares What have you done with the dagger? - I have it - Hide it somewhere I don't want to know where Those books lie I love you I don't hate you Cold Still cold Frozen I just want to be sure Don't worry, you won't find it Because it's not in this room - You're sure? - Absolutely The girl won't find it? Or her mother or father? No chance, it's well hidden Anyway... - There's other knives here - Yes... but it seems Mircala Karstein isn't interested in them What's up, you feel ill? This is to calm the nerves A mere precaution. She seems better Turn over, please There, we're done I'll give you another shot tomorrow For now, carry on your life as normal Eat, drink, take a walk, you'll soon recover You'll do that for me? What's this? A bruise... How did that happen? My ring... I had to slap her I can only give you my opinion, it's not a diagnosis I only deal with diseases, hepatitis, pneumonia I can't tell you exactly what's up with your wife Infantile fears... a tendency to dwell on childhood myths Perhaps emotional problems connected with the marriage - Should I get a psychiatrist? - I knew you'd ask I guess you want me to say no, isn't that right? - I don't want to scare her - It's just nightmares I don't see any need for a psychiatrist, at least for now There is one thing To be honest, your wife seems very infantile She is very young, just a child Believe me, I wish I could suggest a simple solution You've done a lot. Thanks for reassuring me You're welcome Who is it? The woman from my dreams - She's a very pretty ghost - Yes What did he say? The doctor? What he told you, not to worry I know I'm not ill I guess you told him about my dreams What did he think? The same as me Look... here are your dreams And here's reality When a person sleeps, the dividing line is imprecise But on waking, it's like a wall Dreams here and reality there, they can't be mixed You believe that? Are you sure? - But I saw that woman - Stop this nonsense You'll never believe me I can't believe in ghosts and accept they're as real as you and me What if I told you I know where you hid the knife? Where? Inside the clock in the dining room You're sure? Come with me Now, where is it? Under the clock face This can't be I hid it somewhere far away I'm tired of your lies. I want you to tell me the truth Did you hide it in the clock? Answer me You've had enough time Now you'll tell the truth You saw the master when he buried it in the forest - Carol! - Leave her Maybe a woman did give you the knife Fine You and I are going to make a pact, OK? Drink the coffee If Susan asks, tell her you saw me bury the dagger in the woods You thought I was taking it from her That's why you hid it in the clock. Alright? She'll only be telling the truth Part of the truth, maybe She'll tell us the truth now I'll ask a question, you must answer yes or no You promise to tell the truth? - Not like that. Say it - Yes Good, now listen to me Did you tell Susan you put the dagger in the clock, yes or no? No Very good Remember, we have a pact. Now you can go - What do you think? - Just games Children's games - But Susan is no longer a child - You're right, sir Who are you? What are you doing? Where's your clothes? I'll get something for you to wear Where to? I don't know - Get a blanket, she's frozen - Is she naked? Looks like it Take her inside, give her a hot drink Yes, sir Is that you? I thought you were asleep. I brought you some clothes I hope they fit Thank you Turn on the light if you want My husband told me what happened. You can eat with us later In about half an hour Can I take a bath? Of course The bathroom's there with everything you need What's your name? I am Carmila We'll wait for you You look good I found these in the wardrobe, I hope you don't mind - I feel beautiful - Thank you Susan is very beautiful, too You're both very kind Let's sit. Dinner is served Sit there, please The center of attention Why were you on that beach? - You know Seagull Island? - NO - I was diving there... - Alone? Sometimes I need to be alone, in the silent depths I must have lost track of time I really don't know what happened to me All I really remember is coming round and seeing you You were lucky, that beach is nearly always deserted Let's toast the strange events which led me there Won't someone be missing you? They might be worried I live alone - After dinner, we'll take you home - I don't know where I live You don't remember, or you don't have a home? I don't remember But you remember your name Carmila Carmila, what else? I don't know VVeH,Iguess you don't have to tell us Maybe tomorrow you'll remember everything Maybe we'll see your photo in a newspaper I don't think so You like it? - That's how you see me? - Yes Why wear them like that? When I close my hands, I feel I'm holding something It's time for bed You're making progress - Goodnight - Goodnight What's up? It's her What of her? Carmila... Carmila is Mircala Not more of this, Susan? They're identical They're the same person She came to kill you I don't like you I hate you I hated you, from the first time you touched my body That's why I'm scared Susan, please. What are you afraid of? Nothing is going to happen Tomorrow, when the sun rises, you'll laugh at all this Now go to sleep, you don't have to worry What's going on? Where have you been? And our guest? She left early today, it was barely dawn Did she say anything? I just saw her go by. She didn't even look at me She doesn't seem very grateful The ghost must have remembered its own story She went and will not return Disappeared - or maybe she wasn't a ghost As you said, everything is different in daylight That woman understands what's troubling you It's easy to be cruel to you Susan, what happened last night? Why won't you say? What does that woman want? Nothing's happened. Just that I feel better now Who did this to you? Does it hurt? No Right... Now I think she should see a psychiatrist Why not? I don't understand these things And I don't think a psychiatrist would either Look at this dagger It's identical to the one that Susan mysteriously found This is Mircala Karstein, you know the legend Susan found this in the basement, as it is now With this hole cut in the face Look... only the date of birth Our unusual guest was called Carmila Mircala, Carmila, the same letters rearranged See these rings? Carmila was naked but for her rings And what a coincidence... she wears them this way Susan drew this from memory The face of the woman who visits her in dreams And this is the portrait she made of Carmila - It's easy to imagine a similarity - That close? This morning I looked for this box I remember seeing as a child People believe an ancestor of mine tried to poison her husband It's a powerful poison. I tried it on a hare Mircala or Carmila. Who knows? OK, so is that it? For now, yes It was hard for me to tell you all this I hope now you know it's more than just a legend - You find it funny? - NO, I'm sorry But with some coincidences and a little imagination... the result would be exactly the same What do you call coincidence? How many times is something not a coincidence? In some cases, simply twice In others it's scientifically unacceptable... even at 1000 times I assume you think this is in the second category That's exactly what I think And I hope you agree I'm really confused right now and I don't know what to believe I hoped you would listen, advise me, help me... The truth is, though I'm afraid to say it... and ashamed to accept it... I would say that... Carmila or Mircala is a supernatural being Really, that's a bit too much - How can you think that...? - Wait! Come in Sit down Tell the doctor what you saw this morning Yes sir I was setting traps in the woods, and heard noises I thought it might be some prey But no, it was Miss Susan and that other woman They were hiding in the bushes and... - I don't know if I should... - Come on, tell him She was biting her neck What do you mean? Who bit whom? The other woman bit Miss Susan. I saw it with my own eyes Susan has marks on her neck What else did you see with your own eyes? Nothing, I was afraid I'd be seen So I left - I heard howling - Howling? You mean both women howled? Like two cats in heat. That's how they sounded Like vampires Your sanctuary was looted Your rest disturbed Your stained and contaminated shroud, grossly invaded in a vile way In this desecrated fortress, I seek consolation for my troubled soul No judge can judge me I obey the irresistible law which makes my strength and weakness Your heart is wounded, and mine craves... The ecstasy of your death I live only in your flesh And you will die Die to live through me. I cannot help it As I seek you, you will search for one... to share the ecstasy of this cruelty... the only form of love for you and for me Say it I hate him - Say it again - I hate him Say it with all your heart I hate him He has desecrated your body to humiliate you He has desecrated my body to humiliate me Invaded your body to enslave you Invaded my body to enslave me DO you really know Susan? You're a friend of her family and knew her since she was a child But... how much do you actually know? Maybe she and Carmila were friends at school As close as two sisters, or even closer Are you crazy? That's an absurd suggestion This could be some sort of childhood pact Stop it! How can you think such nonsense? You act like a father whose son was charged with a crime I want an explanation, you're just being offensive Then I'll just keep my mouth shut NO! I'm waiting to hear what it was you saw Then listen and draw your own conclusions Last night I witnessed a grotesque ritual... between Susan and your wife I won't give you all the details But she's certainly not a ghost Carmila is flesh and blood. A perverse paranoiac Your wife is just an innocent victim One last thing... Both are very dangerous. Not for me, but for you You know why? Yes, you obviously do... Because in this triangle... you are the intruder Freshly extracted... it appears as a red fluid Its flavor... is slightly sweet The human body... contains about a gallon and a half It is a little heavier than water But its viscosity... is five or six times greater Our life... depends on a constant supply... of the substances it transports Another important function of blood... is to transmit heat to the body That's all for today Leave your notebooks on the table - Aren't you tired? - I slept all day long Goodnight Kill him! Kill him now! End his arrogance! Kill him! Slash his face! Find his heart and tear it out! Silence him Punish him for his insolence. Kill him! Kill him! Destroy his evil powers Kill him! Kill him! Run! The doctor hoped to catch you, but not like this What can I do with you? You want me to open the trap? Alright But first I'll tie your hands No, I don't trust you You do it... Around your wrist That's it Very good Now the other one They will return. They cannot die HOME NEWS: MAN CUTS OUT THE HEARTS OF THREE WOMEN
