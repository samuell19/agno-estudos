[dramatic music] - Hold her hard to starboard, my lad! Point her around the horn, and then it's rolling home! - Aye-aye, Bill! She's rolling, Bill. We're losing steam! - Buncle, what are you doing down there, baking a cake? I thought I... [Bill gasps] [Buncle yells] [water splashes] [all whimper] - I can't take it anymore. I need my greens, a simple shrub. Penguin? That's just like veggie pie, right? [Buncle laughs maniacally] - Get your mitts off me! I'm pure poultry! - I need food! Penguin pie! - Get a hold of yourself, Buncle. He's our mate! - I'll eat anything! [thunder rumbles] [gentle music] - Well, if this isn't a mystery more than words can utter. It looks like a phantom pot, packing hot. [dish clatters] - Well, pickle me in brine. It's a never ending... - Pudding! [Buncle laughs] It's mine! All mine, I tell you! - Well, if that doesn't douse your faith in human nature. - Pudding for the rest of my life! [Buncle screams] - The pudding! - The pudding! [water splashes] [dramatic music] Well, this is the most fun food in occurrence. [Buncle grunts] [ice crumbles] [Buncle screams] - [Sam] There's more at work here than simple flower and water, eh Bill? - I propose that on this here day, we two humble travelers form the Noble Society of Pudding Owners, dedicated to the protection of the aforementioned pudding which I henceforth name... Pudding. [both scream] - What are you two staring it? Haven't you ever seen a steak and kidney pudding before? By the way, the name's Albert, thank you very much! Now, shut up and eat me! [gentle music] [Buncle gasps] - I want that pudding. [ominous music] [thumping] - [Wattleberry] Bunyip! - Not more whiskers. - [Wattleberry] Bunyip! Bunyip, where's me soup? - Coming, Uncle Wattleberry. [Bunyip yelps] - I've got it! - [Wattleberry] Bunyip! - Hey Bunyip, you forgot the candles. - Thanks, fellas'. - What do you call that? I thought I asked for soup. - I just thought this might be more appropriate, considering what day it is. It's my birthday. - What, whose birthday is it? Oh! Happy birthday, lad! Here's your present. I didn't have time to wrap it, I'm afraid. It's a... an empty punch bowl. Enjoy. - Thanks. [yelps] Uncle, this isn't just my birthday. Today I'm officially grown up. [Wattleberry gasps] Rumpus. - Greetings, dear boy, from the humble news. [Wattleberry gasps] On ode to Bunyip on his coming of age. Greetings, young friend, on this auspicious day. Greetings for I have something important to say. As a baby, you came to me and my brother. An orphan you were, no father, no mother. Go forth, young koala. The time has come at last. Go forth, and discover the secret of your past. - But, what are these? - Your father's walking stick and hat. He'd have wanted you to have them. [Wattleberry gasps] [Wattleberry screams] - Oh my. [Wattleberry groans] - I thought we agreed I'd tell him about you know what on his birthday. - It is his birthday. - On his 50th birthday! By then he won't care if he's an orphan or not! - You mean... I'm not an orphan after all? - The truth is we don't know. When you were a child your parents traveled to a town over the mountains and were never to return. Maybe it's time you found out for certain. - I'm going to find my parents. ♪ Starting today I'm on my way ♪ Nothing to lose ♪ Isn't life grand ♪ Stick in my hand ♪ Two walking shoes ♪ I'll never be bothered or blue ♪ ♪ Out on the road ♪ Goodbye toodle-doo - What about my dinner? ♪ Don't hold me back ♪ I'm on the track ♪ It's a wonderful day - Good luck, Bunyip.

[Bunyip sighs] - That was most unexpected. Perhaps someone at that store might help me. [both screaming] - Oh, I knew her when she was a chicken. - Oh, yes. [crashing] [chickens clucking] - Excuse me, I'm looking for someone who... Oh. - Puddings. They're asking about puddings. - Who cares about puddings? Get out of my store! - I see the price of eggs has gone up again. - Could you help me? - Go, go, go! - I'm looking for my... How very odd. Oh, hey. You there. - What's that? - I wondered if you could help me. I'm looking for my parents, Mr. And Mrs. Bluegum. [Bandicoot babbles] I'm not going to hurt you. You see, my parents went over some mountains and disappeared. - I don't know nothing about no mountains and nothing about no Bluegums, and if you see Mr. Buncle you can tell him I said so myself. - Wait! What do you know about my mom and dad? I need to know, that's all. Blast. [Bunyip groans] This is becoming rather more dangerous. [Bunyip yelps] [water splashes] Well, if that doesn't blow the dust from your whiskers. It smells like a pudding. - Hey, it's not self-service, big nose! - Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize. - Aye, pudding thief! - What? - Steal our pudding, will you? - I think there's some mistake. I have no idea what you're talking about. - That's what all pudding thieves say! - That get-up is a typically weak pudding thief disguise. - Ow, would you leave my... Ow! I'm not a pudding thief. I'm looking for my parents. - Hit him again, Bill! [Albert yelps] - Now, that's the most "bun-foodlin'" idea I've ever heard. - Bill, could we be mistaken? - My mom and dad disappeared 10 years ago. I just want to find out what happened to them. - Chasing after parents. Why'd a fellow want to do a thing like that? [dramatic music] - Six inches too short for a pudding thief. Bill Barnacle's the name. - Bunyip Bluegum. - And, this is my first mate, Sam Sawnoff. - Can't be too careful, you know? - What are you talking about? He's a pudding thief! I'll kick a confession out of him. - Steady, Albert. A bloke's got to admit when he's wrong. - How remarkable.

Tell Mr. Buncle I don't know nothing at all about nothing. All right? - All I asked you was whether you knew my parents. And, who's this Mr. Buncle? - Stop saying those names! Now, do you want to be getting us all killed? - Why? - All I can tell you is this. Find the frog who sits on the log.

[Albert groans] [gentle music] [campfire crackles] [Bill clears throat] - For his part in confounding the thieves, saving the pudding, I'd like to propose that young Bunyip here become a member of the Noble Society of Pudding Owners. - The Noble Society of Pudding Owners? And, who are they? - Them's us. It's a long and noble history. Oi, quit shoving! A long time ago in the Garden of Eden, Adam met Eve and they did a bit of wedding.

[ominous music] [whip cracks] [hissing] [Buncle grunts] - Did anyone ever tell you it's rude to chew with your mouth open? [Buncle belches] Yeah, guess not. - Nothing left. Someone's going to pay for this! - Could we have some service here please? I meant now! [Ginger giggles] - The thing is, miss, there is nothing left. - What do you mean nothing? You know the penalty for failing to deliver. - No more food? - Not a bean sprout. You've eaten a lot. - Where's my pudding thieves? - Call the pudding thieves! - Call the pudding thieves! - Call the pudding thieves! - Call the pudding thieves! - We are the pudding thieves. [rumbling] [both yell] - Your pudding thieves, sir. - G'day uncle. You're looking trim. [Watkin giggles] - Shut up! Just hand it over. [rattling] What's this? - The magic gum nut? - No pudding? - The thing is, and I know you'll get a kick out of this, we don't actually have the actual pudding as yet if you follow what I mean. - Bring me that pudding, or I'll send you down to the food mines! [Possum gasps] - Not the food mines! - Spare me for the sake of my mother, your own dear sister! - Where do you think Deirdre's been for the last five years? - Oh. - Now get out! - Yes, uncle. Certainly, uncle. Whatever you say, uncle. - And, don't you dare come back until you've got it! [frenzied music] - If this goes on much longer while I'll have to [shudders] eat meat! [crowd gasps] Whip those builders! I know you're out there somewhere, pudding. [gentle music] - There's nothing finer than strolling along with your mates in the early morning when the air is smelling like bath soap. - I wish I could say the same about you. - I do appreciate you joining me on my quest. - Well, that's what pudding owners do, stick together. - Well said, Mr. Sawnoff, and on such a fine day, three stout mates and a spirited pudding can achieve anything, certainly find something as simple as a frog on the log. - Excuse me, kind sirs. Could you help a Highland lassie and her poor wee starving bairn? [Watkin cries] - Rest easy, ma'am. No tiny tot will go starving while Bill Barnacle has a pudding to share around. - Wait a minute, Bill. Now it's become a fruit and nut cake. - With lots of chocolate sprinkles. - Ya wee scallywag. - And, a cherry on top! - This is so humiliating. - That's not Highland lassie and poor wee bairn. - Possum! You're giving us away. - I can't help it. I forgot to eat breakfast. - Treachery! Nothing gives a pudding thief away like a fruit and nut cake with chocolate sprinkles and a cherry on top! - Pudding thieves? Us? [air blows] [giggles] - We'll thump your heads. - And, bend your snaps. - I shan't be able to fight this afternoon as I've got a sore foot. - And, I've got a stiff flipper. - Come back and fight, you simpering thief lugs. - And, they take no shame to fight the lame when they deserve to cup it, so do not try to pipe your eye, or with my flip I'll flop it. [Sam claps] - And, tell anyone else who's thinking of swiping our Albert they'll get the same. - Oh, my hero. - Oi Albert, come back. - Oi! Come back here! - I wish everyone wouldn't keep running away.

[fly buzzes] And, I have been waiting for you. - Wait. Wait a minute, you're the frog on a log. I've been searching everywhere for you. - It is not I you search for. It is your parents, Bunyip. [Bunyip sniffles] And, if you want to find them you must listen very carefully to what I have to say. Where two gums meet but stand alone there's plenty of water, but it's dry as a bone. [splashing] [dishes clatter] - Poor little beggar. - Gone just like that without even a chance for a last goodbye. - And, just as we were getting on so well. So, who gets the hat? - Albert. [Albert sneezes] Some respect for a fellow dear departed pudding owner if you don't mind. [Bunyip grunts] [Bunyips yelps] We're under attack! - Has Bigfoot come for a slice of steak and kid? - I found the frog. - It's Bunyip! - Well, I'll be "sop dungled." - And, she told me exactly where to find my parents. - Did she? And, where's that? - Where two gums meet but stand alone there's plenty of water, but it's dry as a bone. - This fall you had, you didn't happen to land on your head did you? - I'm not crazy, Albert. It's a clue! - Whatever you say. - This calls for a celebration! One clue solved, one more to go. [both whistle] Gum leaf turnover! - Gum leaf turnover! - Oh, for crying out loud. [Bunyip sighs] - To Mr. And Mrs. Bluegum, wherever you may be. [ominous music] [whip cracks] [grunting] [Meg sighs] - I want food. The slaves are smelling good enough to eat. [Buncle laughs maniacally] - Where two gums meet yet stand alone there's plenty of water, but it's dry as a bone. [Bill giggles] - Can't think of anywhere fitting that description, and Bill and me have been around. [Albert whistles] - Some are berry pudding going to waste over here. - Pudding owners, all we have to do is approach this problem logically. - Why do I even bother? [Sam sniffs] - Can anyone smell smoke? - Fire! Fire! Fire out of control! [dramatic music] Volunteers needed! Volunteers needed! - Volunteers present and accounted for. Mavericks! Starboard Sam, Bunyip, take on the stack on the tops, and bring in the weather earring. - What? - Best if you just nod. Aye-aye, Bill. - To the fire! [dramatic music] This ain't so bad. I've seen worse configurations aboard ship. - Bush fire brigade procedure requires a securing of puddings in a fireproof sack! - You can't put me in there! - Get in. - Get in yourself. - Excuse me, we pudding owners prefer to manage our own security, if you don't mind. - I'll take care of him. [Albert blows raspberry] [dramatic music] - Brigade procedure says I'm in charge. I says I'm charge. Are you listening to me? Is anyone? [water splashes] - Where two gums meet, but stand alone? - Oh lord, can we give the family thing a rest? It's hopeless. - But, everyone needs to know who their family is. - Families is nothing but trouble. You're always having to look out for them. - Bill! - Not too close, Bill. Wouldn't want to burn a towel. - Look out! - What are you? Brave work, fellow pudding owner. [Albert gasps] - [Albert] Careful, I bruise easily!

[all scream] [Watkin gags] - Here's the plan. [both groan] I say we take this pudding inside to test if he's the real one before we take him to uncle Buncle. [Watkin laughs maniacally] [Possum laughs] [sign squeaks] [harmonica music] - [Bill] Where are ya? - What? - Albert? [Sam chirping] - Excuse me, sir. I was wondering if you'd seen a singed possum pass this way. - A singed possum, eh? - That's right. - Well now... First things first, fellas, you got any tea? [Bill grunts] - There you go. Now. - What about sugar? [Bill grunts] - Okay, okay, you got your tea and your sugar. - Any bread? - Blasted poultry. - Easy, Bill. - Let's not lose our tempers. Right, you've got your tea, your sugar, and your bread. Now, have you seen a singed possum? - No. [Bill groans] - You may now lose your temper. - I'll land you a sock down there on the muzzle, you low down, hook nosed, sugar grabber! - Singed possum. Why didn't you say so in the first place? All the hollering and shaking? How's a parrot supposed to think? - Hold on. That hill has an aroma most dangerously suggestive of beef gravy. Forward, pudding rescuers! [all cheer] - You could get gravy, you say? You wouldn't have any beef and spuds to go with it, would you? - They're torturing him with small helpings. - Right. - No, wait. If it's locked it'll just mean they know we're here, and then they'll never come out. Even total idiots aren't completely stupid. - [Albert] Help! - Superbly reasoned. - Why, the poor little fella. - Never give way to despair while whiskers can be made from dry grass. - [Albert] How can you abuse a kidnapped pudding like this? Help! Anyone listening? Hello? Help! [door thuds] [both gasp] - Keep an eye on that pudding. - Poodles, Petting, Pudding enlarger at your service. - What? - Pudding enarger. You didn't book a pudding enlarger? [both laugh] - No. - You sure you haven't got a pudding I can enlarge? - [Possum] Oh, pudding enlarger wouldn't that be good? He'd make a bigger pudding, yeah. - Is it... expensive? - No. [Bill groans] [all yell] [Albert blows raspberry] - Arrivederci, big nose! - Albert, come back here. [dramatic music] Albert, what are you doing? - It's a touchdown from a plucky koala. Back with you, am I? - Where would you be without your family to look out for you, Albert? You should be more grateful. It's a very noble characteristic. - Do you always talk with a stick up your bottom? - Albert. [Bunyip sighs] I've got to find those two gum trees. - Hey, where's he off to. - Two gums, parents, the usual. [cooky music] - It's a terrible thing when a young fellow's hopes get raised for naught. - [Sam] Come on. - Hello? We just have to go about this logically. It can't be too hard to find. Look at me! Mister logical fancy pants, stick up the bum... [Albert yelps] - I'm terribly sorry. I don't know what came over me. - Yeah, he'll do that to you all right. Don't worry yourself about it. Right-o Albert, you had that one coming. Pull on your mantle, and get down here! - Well, I'll be rolled in flour and baked as a strudel. Oi, one of you fellas mention something about two gums meeting? - That's enough lip from you, sonny Jim. - That's it! Where two gums meet yet stand alone. [triumphant music] - [Bill] Plenty of water, but dry as a bone. - This is the place! [lively music] [ominous music] - Doesn't want the skink. Plump, juicy parrots can be very, very tasty. Even better than rat they say. - Blah! Tastes like bristle, and smells like a bear cage. - What if we sauteed them in a tree snake oil and serve with a garnish of Withcetty grubs? - The thing's will get stuck in my teeth. - Or, Freekah seed au natural with a Hollandaise sauce. - How many times do I have to tell ya? I want something plump and tender! [ominous music] [chain rattles] [gasps] - Too stringy. Too flabby. To [groans] utterly repulsive. - Stop! If you have to take one of us, then take me. - And, me. Leave them alone. [Ginger growls] - Bingo. Plump and tender. My lord, may I present Mr. And Mrs. Bluegum! [Meg whimpers] - Courage, Meg. We're not his dinner yet. - You soon will be if my boys don't find that pudding. - All right, all right, I was wrong, so dip me in batter and deep fry me, but for heaven's sake stop and eat. - Found him right where we want him. [Watkin laughs] Let's do it. - Do what? [Watkin groans] Oh, that. Aye-aye, skipper! [both groan] [water rushes] - Hello, is anyone listening? I mean, what about a bit of variety, eh? I mean, think of the penguin. I could do something with fish. I could do Shepherd's pie! I could do Tapioca pudding. I can do cream and chocolate pudding with almonds, but oh no. - You just don't know when you're on a good thing, do you Albert? - Oh, hurrah, yippee. I'm inside a hat that smells of fish, lucky me. - He's an excitable chap, but his heart's in the right spot. [Sam shushes] - What's that sound? [all scream] - Typical.

For me, the most important thing about today was getting one step closer to tracking down my mom and dad. Meg and Tom Bluegum. They were taken from me 10 years ago, and I believe they came to this town. So, if anyone has seen them... If anyone knows anything at all. - Excuse me, excuse me. I'll tell you! - No, you shut up. - Or, what? You'll tell Buncle? Well, I don't care. The time has come to tell the truth. This lad saved both our homes and our lives. You ask yourself how we can repay them? Well, I say the least we can do is tell the fella the fate of his poor mom and dad. - What? What happened to my parents? - They were taken, all right. - Taken where? [dramatic music] - I don't like this one little bit. There's gonna be tears before bedtime, you mark my words. [Bandicoot yelps] - Oh, boy goodness. Me poor faithful melon. This be the place, and that be where your mother and father were taken. - So, uncle was right. I really am an orphan. - An orphan? Geez, that's worse than being stood on by cows. - Poor little beggar. - Get a grip, you sentimental sack of flour. - At least you've got your memories. - I don't even have that. - What have you got fluid in your vein, milk or gravy? Now, show some guts. - Albert, what are you doing? - Doing my job, you yellow bellied poultries. Let's go and find them! - Oh boy, oh boy. That's the last you've seen of him. - If Albert isn't afraid then neither am I. Who's with me? - What? Looks like the only mate a fellow can rely on is a pudding owner. Now, forward mateys! [dramatic music] - Food. Must. Eat. Food. [Buncle groans] - Guards! Prepare the koalas. Chop, chop. Move it, one, two, three, one, two, three. - My hat. - Could it be? [both cough] - Silence! [lizard growls] [Possum whimpers] - Shut up! It'll be all right. Now, we'll just tell uncle that there's no such thing as a magic pudding. It was just a dream. - Yeah, yeah. No such thing as a magic pudding. [both scream] - Stand back! Pudding on a mission! [dramatic music] Move it, you reptilian riff raff! - Stop that pudding! [Buncle groans] - I can still smell koala. - Toss 'em on the grill! [frenzied music] - Ow! Dinner is served! - Where do I start? How will I even know what they look like? [Meg and Tom scream] - Pudding. Pudding. Long time no see, eh Buncy? [Buncle laughs] [Bill gasps] - It's that great guzzling lump of a wombat who swiped that pudding in the seven seas. [Sam growls] - So, here's your pudding uncle. Is now a good time to discuss our reward? - How do you like this reward? Guards! [both yell] [Buncle laughs] - Come on, save yourselves. - Bunyip, hurry up. Hurry up and eat me. [Buncle grunts] Oi, wash your hands first. [Buncle belches] - [Ginger] Let's party!

[Buncle laughs] - I knew if I kept going I'd find you in the end. I just knew it. - Our Bunyip. - You've done us proud, son. [Bill sniffles] - It's bloomin' dust, that's all. - Of course, Bill. - Right-o, right-o, you can all stop getting mushy. The job ain't done yet. - Mom, dad, we've got to save our friend. - Of course. - And, when we do I'm gonna tan his sorry backed hide. - Loyal pudding owners, we have a pudding to rescue. - [Sam] Clear away! [triumphant music] - This is an outrage. I mean, I demand to be released at once. And, would a little mouthwash kill you? - Is it true, Sam, that this pudding will turn into anything one might choose to think of? - It's part in parcel of being a pudding. - Then I might just have an idea. - Let go of our pudding, you lead bellied beached whale! - Pudding, do your stuff. Anything without meat. Vegetable pie. [both whistle] - Meat pie! - Meat pie! [Buncle whistles] - I said veggie pie! - Oh, make your mind up. [both whistle] - You call yourself a magic pudding? He said he wants veggie pie, Albert. In fact, give him a double serve of veggie pie. - Well, of all the bung foolin' cross-eyed things to say. - Did you say double? - That's your job, pudding. We'll grab Albert and leave Buncle with the double. - But, of course. Why didn't I think of that? - [All] A double serve of veggie pie, a double serve of veggie pie. - No, don't! No! You're tearing me in two! - [All] A double serve of veggie pie. - Don't do it. You musn't use your magic for greed. - [All] A double serve of veggie pie. - Oh, shove a dink it in you self centered bowl of treacle, he's hungry. - [All] A double serve of veggie pie. - Don't listen to that giant flea bag. Follow your heart! - Aren't smart, you rancid cream puff. - [Albert] How'd you like a kick on the gizzards? - [Pudding] I dare ya. - [Albert] I double dare ya! - A million serves of veggie pie! - Run! Run for your lives! You're meddling with the forces of nature. It'll destroy the whole fabric of the universe. [suspenseful music] - If it's more pudding you want. Then that's what you'll get. - Blustering blimps! - Give me all the puddings in the world! [Buncle laughs] Mommy! [dish rattles] - [Albert] My crust hurts. [gentle music] - Leaping lizards! It's Albert. Well done, matey. You dispatched the biggest pudding thief of all. - Albert. You don't think that... - Come on, you lazy loaf. Get up. Albert, stop mucking around right now. [Bill sniffles] - We're too late. - Now, why do he have to go and do a dour thing like that for? [Bill cries] [Sam cries] - Come back for more, you turnip munching sack of sap. - Albert, you little roper. You did it. - You've saved us all! - Piece of cake. [cheery music] [Sam cheers] - Ahoy, mateys! Prepare to cast off for the maiden voyage of the Saucy Soup Tureen. [both cheer] - Crew on deck and ready to sail, Bill! - The world is an adventure, as you will find, so fly my little doves, expand your minds. - Oh, shut up, Rumpus. - Would you like seconds, old timer? - With my indigestion? Are you mad? - Listen, my little cupcake, I'm a universal force for good. Now, eat me! - And, on winter nights we always have pudding and hot coffee for supper. And, I've heard many other tales of ships and far away lands and magic sitting around the fire with all my mates. So, now that you know where we are, why not drop in for a slice of pudding? - Hey.
