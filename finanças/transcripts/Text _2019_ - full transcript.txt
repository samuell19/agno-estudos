Yes, my name is Anna Vitalievna, I represent the "Mosobryad" funeral home. We have been looking for you for days, couldn't reach you over the phone. Here. I can't right now. Come on, Ilya, you have to. Listen, it has been four days since Tamara Sergeevna passed away, and you still haven't taken her from the morgue. This is not right. I don't really have the money right now. Its really not that expensive, honestly, 25,500, the basic package, a casket with everything included, the 7 cm crown, transportation for the attendees in a comfortable vehicle, by the way, A wood cross on a pole. But you know, I think that you better choose the standard package, and I'll tell you why. The crown is bigger, plus the casket has silk lining. 35,500, the difference is not that big. Maybe your friends can help, or neighbours, for that matter. This is fucking bullshit, I don't have that kind of money. Got an iPhone charger? Yes, a licensed Chinese one for 1500. This one, a sweet off-brand one, from China as well, for 1200, and a really Chinese one for 700. The 700 one. You need an adapter? 300 rubles. Yes. Petya this is mom. Please call me back. I saw some very disturbing dreams about you today. Are you on an assignment or something? And please tell me, what happened with Nina, what happened to her? Please call me back. On an assignment.

There is enough for you too, get over here. Nah, I'm drinking red today, not white. Truth. Truth? Mhm. When are you gonna pick "dare"? Okay, truth it is. Have you ever cheated on me? Petya, this is like energy. Energy for a force field. Like in science fiction. I spend the energy on you, on us, to keep both of us under a protective field. And if I spend it on others, everything will collapse. I am too afraid to spend it on others. Because... I love you. And now, I would like to formally confess my love... To this tv show. I told you you'd be into it. The music is fire. Is there a ringtone? Want some wine? Okay. Listen, let's go to Colombia for the New Years? "Denis Sergeyevich" Denis Sergeevich: What assignment?! Did you forget who you are talking to?! I give you one second! Khazin! Have you lost your fucking mind? Where the hell are you? I have some kind of food poisoning, 104 fever, spent the whole day in bed. And who's gonna receive get the product for the abreks? What are you planning to sell them? I bet you just got wasted at a club. Are you bailing on the assignment? Tell me, you bastard. Its some kind of virus or the flu, I don't know. Body aches, cough, didn't leave the toilet all day. Fuck, alright. By Monday I want you here, on the dot, do you understand? Get well. And tell your old man I say hi. Yes sir, yes. How do you even know my father? Denis Sergeevich...

Korzhavin Boris Pavlovich with his wife and daughter, Ksenia, what a beauty. My dear mom. And who do we have here? My father, the guest of honor today. That's enough already. I'm looking back at how we celebrated when I got the lieutenant, Natasha, dear, do you remember? Of course I do. It was in my college dorm, we had no place of our own at the time. Well, the Captain and Major stars we toasted to at our own apartment, And I think many of you remember how we celebrated when I got the Colonel. Some of you will know the struggle, because you also went through this. Right, Boris Pavolovich? Exactly. Yura, I would like to add to your toast. You, brother, are a General Major now. And, as they say, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. You son is already a Major. So what I'm saying is you have a good family dynasty. Well, not without your help, Boris Pavlovich. Come on, he achieved everything on his own. I can only help with the dowery, whenever the kids make up their minds. So I'm guessing we are toasting to the dynasty, right? Hear, hear! Fuck, his father is a General. Forget prison, they'll just finish me off. Shit. You, brother, are a General Major now. And, as they say, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. You son is already a Major. So what I'm saying is you have a good family dynasty. So I'm guessing we are toasting to the dynasty, right? Hear, hear! You, brother are a General Major now You son is already a Major. You have a good family dynasty. Hear, hear! Shit. -This does not concern you anymore -Nina, pick up the phone! Don't you dare! -Good luck to you, Petya. Just make sure not to fuck daughters of anyone below the lieutenant rank. Your daddy will be disappointed -You bitch! Everything that happened with him is because of you! -Everything that happened to you is because of him. Good bye, Petya. Its your life. Fuck whoever you want. Remember this? I would like to officially announce one thing. Happiness exists! And this is it! Took you long enough. Are you here to collect? No, I am not ready yet. First 7 days are free, after that we charge. Will you take a look? Mhm. Put on the shoe covers. I am sorry I'm late, mom. So much has happened. I will get you later, okay? I will sort everything out. I will set everything straight. Okay? Mom. A passport, a phone, 504 rubles, a cross. Was your mother religious? Very. We have a chapel here at the hospital. You can book a memorial service there. What's the point? I mean, aren't you supposed to do that? If the person was religious. Don't worry it's not expensive. Do you get commission from this? Why would say this? We help them, they help us in return, we work together. Too bad there is no guarantee... Doesn't matter where you stick the candles, so screw it. I don't understand how this goddamn world works, Try all you want, everyone is heading straight to hell. Especially here, in Russia. "Blossom" travel agency Good afternoon. Hello. Came here to get some warmth? To dream. Dreams do come true. Take a seat. Thank you. Would you like some coffee? Where would you like to go? Colombia. Very beautiful country. Not very safe though, but not as bad as before. The jungle, the adventure, very beautiful women. When are you planning to go? Um... I mean, I don't even have a passport. You could get one, we actually work with an agency that does that. There are some additional expenses, of course, but they can get it done in three days, if you book the older passport format. I can't get a passport. Are you a policeman? Quite the opposite. A felon. Well let's call them right now and find out? Natalia Georgievna, good afternoon. This is Galya from "Blossom", yes, I have a question regarding passport issuance, the person has a criminal record Did you serve the whole sentence or were you released on parole? The entire sentence. Then I will send him over to you okay? Mhm, yeah, we will talk about the rates. Yes, thank you. Well, she says that if you served the whole sentence you are free to travel. So I... I can leave from here? I would put it this way: you can take a trip to Columbia. If you want your passport in two days it's 50000 and it will cost you 10000 to get it in two weeks. Let me give you their number, they have some connections at the Federal Migration Service, tell them I sent you and they will help you. Don't forget, okay? I will think about it. Good bye. Good bye. Petya I don't understand what's going on? Your assignments, work, and you can't find time to talk to me. Nina is scheduled for a surgery at the 85th hospital. I tried to find everything out on my own, but they won't tell me anything on call. I am begging you, please go there and find out what happened. I am extremely worried. Nina I don't know how to straight up tell you this. Recently you've been crying a lot. And I, in turn, become even more distant and can't remember what I wanted to tell you. So yeah, I am not really overcome with joy when we talk about the child because... I mean, I am just scared that this is the end of my freedom you know, and I feel like this is not my decision, and its not yours either, and I'm afraid that as a father... I mean I would be a shitty father probably even worse than my own, because at least he had some expectations for me and I am utterly selfish, you know me. How could I raise a child? And it's not that I don't love you. I love you as much as I am capable of. I am just terribly afraid, Nina. I thought, people get knocked up all the time. And everyone is afraid, I can't be the only one. and everyone is pretending to be happy in front of each other. But in reality no one knows what to do next. But then they somehow manage it. They stroll around parks, all happy, with their children. Cuddle them. So they do change. They become happier. I know I'm a mess. But the main thing is Let this child change us for the better. Hello. Hello. I would like to know the condition of one of the patients. Last name? Livkovskaya, Nina. Obstetrics and gynaecology? Yes. If you want, you can go upstairs to see the doctor, the cloakroom is there, don't forget the shoe covers. Hello, are you here to see me? Hello. Yes, I am here regarding one of your patients, Livkovskaya Nina. I am her boyfriend. Boyfriend? Very well. Did you change your mind? What? What do you "what"? The abortion? Do you not know? What a boyfriend. We had a fight... Well, you deal with this on your own, the girl is on her 11th week of pregnancy and as of next week no one in this country will perform an abortion on her. You are running out of time. I messed up a lot, I know. But somehow you patiently took it. You know perfectly well that my parents are against this. But fuck it, I don't need their money, We'll power through this. Won't we, Nina? Yes, Dmitry Sergeyevich? Nina, you are wonderful! I love you! Petya? Petya, are you here? Voice message from Nina So I ran away from there, I won't do anything, that's for sure. I can't. Call me when you can. Thank god! Mom -Mom, don't worry, Nina is okay! Stasya! Come say hi! Good evening. Hello. I'm Ilya. I've heard so much about you. Matvei Sergeevich, say hi. There you go. Let's go play. Come in, take your coat off. How do you like the booze? Smells like tar. It really does. Listen, I came over because I need to borrow some cash. Hm. I'm sorry to do it this way but this is kinda urgent. How much? 50000. Wow. I will pay it back as soon as I can. I got you. I'm gonna go talk to Stasya then. Stasya, Ilya is asking to borrow 50 grand. Are you crazy? Come on, let's lend him the money, what's the issue? I understand that he is a difficult situational, that he is short on money. But let's see, we just moved in. Yeah. We agreed to act maturely, right? How much do you have right now in your account? I have 30 grand for sure, I don't get notifications, but... And I do get notifications, here, see this: 21,750. Okay so see, we can lend him 50 grand. Honey, we can't. We got a mortgage payment this week, car loans too. Okay hold on, I was supposed to pay that yesterday... So you wanna catch up don't you? So far is 2-0, I'm winning. Well, I am counting on winning. Watch out, watch out! What is this? Look at what the devils did. Look inside, what if someone is in there. Hey! Anyone there? The maintenance workers probably left it this way. What kind of people do this? I'll close it, hold this. indistinct chatter Ouch! Damn it. Hey, be careful. Done? Done, it's all sealed. Almost lost my fingers to this. Went to the clinic... Talked her out of it... At the last minute... She seemed happy, I think. You wrote a good message to her. You are going to have a child. A son, probably. I think it's a boy. Fuck. Look! Mom texted. Like she knew. All moms know. Petya, it's a relief to know that everything is alright. I have already pictured all sorts of things in my head. God bless, everything will sort itself out. Please don't get mad, but this could be the perfect moment for you to reevaluate your life. Maybe find a new job. You are not happy in your job, Petya. I've been thinking about it a lot, ever since you got into this. You wanted to go to a law school after the academy, it was your dad who insisted on a military career. You could have been an amazing lawyer. Father always wants you to be like him, but you are a completely different person. I remember how you resented the service at first, how much you disliked their ways, the bureaucracy, the close-mindedness. Remember how distressed you were about the college student that went to jail? You probably forgot about that already. Remember how distressed you were about the college student that went to jail... Did you tell your mom about this? I suppose that college student is me, isn't it? Were you really distressed? Remember how distressed you were about the college student that went to jail. You probably forgot about that already. Father told you to forget about all that and forbade you from talking about it. And you went with it. Somehow I missed the exact time when you started enjoying your job, And I still blame myself for that. I am sorry if I am talking to you as if you were a child. You will always be a child to me, whether they are 25 or 30. One day you will understand, when you are raising your own children. Please, patch things up with your dad, you are right and he is wrong. But there is only one week left until his birthday. I cannot imagine you not being there. I can understand him too, he has been trying for so long to get close to Boris Pavlovich and you messed it up with his daughter. Of course father was furious, about your Nina. He misjudged her. And I feel some guilt too. I had my doubts, not because I didn't like her, but because I can only imagine what a young girl from a small town is up to. They can go to any extent. The way you build your career is the way they build relationships. That was our main concern, that she would get pregnant and you would not have no choice anymore. I mean, a child is a woman's greatest weapon against a hesitant man. I have no idea how to break it to your father, because it will only prove him right about Nina. Do what you feel is right. This is way too important to act on anyone's advice. Mom. You have a good mom, Petya. Remember how distressed you were about the college student that went to jail. You probably forgot about that already. -Colombia is here! Care for some? -Oh! I actually just got my bonus at work! - 6g for 200 bucks -Two is more than enough for me! Take everything for 50. Okay, you are very convincing! Remember how distressed you were about the college student that went to jail. You probably forgot about that already. Father told you to forget about all that and forbade you from talking about it. Please, patch things up with your dad, you are right and he is wrong. But there is only one week left until his birthday. Father -I wanted to say I'm sorry! WHAT DO I NEED YOUR APOLOGIES FOR YOU SCUMBAG YOU SCREWED OVER MY ENTIRE LIFE ALL BECAUSE OF YOUR CHEATING TO DUMP KORZHAVIN'S FAUGHTER FOR THAT SLUT FROM MINSK! AFTER YOU DRAGGED HER INTO YOUR MESS! AND DON'T YOU DARE SHOW YOUR FACE AT MY BIRTHDAY! You dad is a real cunt. Money is not an issue. We'll find 300 grand. This time make sure everything is straight -Whats up with Maga, did you arrange the Colombia deal? You are an idiot, I can see that you read the message. Did you lose your phone? This is DS. -No, Denis Sergeyevich I didn't arrange it Khazin, where are you right now? I have some free time, let's meet and talk this over. We need to discuss Maga, come up with a plan, get our people ready. And just talk to me already! -Later. Denis Segreyevich Reporting a SUV in a crash, both passengers under the influence of drugs, one of them the driver. Knocked over a police officer, started a fight. The perpetrator is a Major, working for the DEA. Oh! What a sight! Fucking shit, all of you are going down! What are you looking at huh? My dad is a deputy minister, you are all gonna get screwed! So, who do we have here? Bring her as a witness, will you? Bring her where, you fucking egghead?! I'm gonna be the one bringing you! What kind of a ministry to we have, huh? Yours ministry, yours!

This is plenty for you, and your daddy, and your former father-in-law! ...and your ministry is nothing to my service. I got the Ace card here. Good afternoon, are you joining someone? Hello, yes. What, Don Pedro didn't make it? He is busy with something. Anton. Got the money on you? Of course. Sit down, come on. Can't just do it right away, can we. Good afternoon, did you decide on anything? Yeah yeah yeah, We would like a taste of your wonderful apple turnovers with custard, and... What do you want? I mean, I wasn't really going to... Well, you haven't tried their incredible apple turnovers, so we'll take, Apple turnovers and again, apple turnovers. Okay. Don't feel like sitting here and eating alone, it's depressing. I get it. So, how long have you known Don Pedro? About 7 years, met at work. That's what I thought. We went to college together. I have a law degree, but worked the most random jobs, can't even remember it all. Sold stocks, then started a business with my buddies, and then they passed a new law, which turned the startup to ashes, just like this- and it's gone. Now I'm an executive. It's so fucking agonizing to show up to work on time man, and the salary is not worth my potential, salary, salary in general, it brings down one's self-esteem. But I do what I gotta do you know? And now they banned casinos. How's that fair? I mean, on one hand its good that they banned it, because we always want what we aren't allowed to have. Like, remember back in the USSR sex was a taboo, and everyone wanted to shag the most. I don't remember myself, but my grandpa told me. Here are your turnovers. Thank you. Enjoy. These days, whoever, whenever, in any position, boys, girls... We have Tinder too, right? No sweat there at all. You got an account? There you go. Everyone has gotten so dull, boring. I judge based on my experience, maybe testosterone has gone down, I don't know. How are the turnovers by the way? Very good. I don't think I ever tried something like this. Speaking of testosterone, look at the Jane Austin-ish girls over there, Let's organize a fun evening today, hm? You know what I mean. Look, they are smiling at us. So here's my plan. Tretyakov's gallery first, then laser tag, shot some guns, then karaoke, then take them to an apartment, and there we'll have some... Apple turnovers. Yeah, with custard. Let's go? We can go over there right now. No, I have a day planned down to a minute, gotta help Pedro, and I recently broke up with a girl, the wounds are still fresh. As you wish. Should we? Hold on, put it away. Put it away I said. Did Pedro not teach you to disguise it? I am constantly paranoid myself, always checking if the battery doesn't drain too fast, if my location doesn't randomly turn on by itself, Your guys can easily hack into all that, then sit there and watch me, can't they? Our guys can. Thats what I always say. Let's go to the bathroom, we'll pay the check later. Good day. Hello. I also used to have a girlfriend, a wife, almost. Then Don Pedro opened my eyes, Now I'm free as a bird. You know dude, I really believe in living in the moment. If you have food- awesome, eat and enjoy If you don't- suck it up. Come in here. If you have the dough- buy some champagne for the ladies, if you don't- borrow money and then buy it. Women like this approach, but only on the first couple of dates. Then something just clicks in them. Maybe I'm not mature enough for the big, pure relationship. But that's okay, I'll trade it for many small dirty ones. Denis Sergeyevich Listen here, Khazin. I'm done playing games with you. Either you come to the office right now, or we will come to you. Got it? The timer starts now. Your guys can easily hack into all that, then sit there and watch me, can't they? I'm done playing games with you. Either you come to the office right now, Or we will come to you. Got it? The timer starts now. I'm done playing games with you. Either you come to the office right now, Or we will come to you. Got it? The timer starts now. Passport and discharge certificate. Alyona, make a copy. Now you need to fill out this form and take a photo. Can you tell me if I will get the passport for sure? I was told all sort of things. If you just come in from the street and ask for it like an idiot- no, but we have a good relationship with the authorities. you think we take all that we charge? Out of these 50 grand we take 10, at best. Okay so, don't check this field, and just to be sure we will make a spelling mistake in your last name. Is that alright? You'll be Goryenov, not Goryunov. So when you are leaving the country they won't be able to find you in the FSB database. And when you go to collect the passport, just don't notice the mistake, got it? Is that allowed? For you- yes. You are a VIP client, after all, not some dingus going to Egypt to stare at the fish. Pay up. Let's take the photo first. Either you come to the office right now, Or we will come to you. Got it? I am not in town right now. I'm sorry, I lost control with the drugs again, give me a couple of days please You are mad, aren't you, mom? Mad at me, right? Don't want me to run away, do you mom? Why are you mad at me, mom. Going to scold me? I need to take responsibility, right mom? I have to pay for everything? Is that what you think mom? And what about him? What did I do to him? 7 years, mom. 7 fucking years. You always told me this, everything has a price, everything in life. And what now? You were the one who raised me, well done. And Petya's parents did a great job raising him too? No one has to pay for anything. You gotta walk all over everyone. So that everyone just takes it and keeps quiet. Thats how Petya was raised. Petya is a good boy, isn't he? Is that what you think mom? But I want to live, mom, to live! To live a normal life! You know mom, forgive me, but I'm not going back to prison. I'm fed up and I don't owe anyone anything. I want to live. I want to go to Colombia, dammit! I want to take girls on bike rides! I want to go clubbing! That's the life I want! Normal, human life! And who's gonna hold me accountable? You? You raised me... raised me well to be a good picture-perfect inmate! And he was raised to be a fucking prison guard! Remember what you always told me, to sit still and not rock the boat! You told me "why did you get involved, you should have kept quiet, Ilya, honey, this wouldn't have happened"!

You from Khazin? I'm here for the money, they'll deliver the product a bit later. 1.5 kilos? Yes, 1.5 kilos. But I need to collect the money. Isaad, give him the money. How much is in here? What we agreed on. 300 euros. Gonna count? No, I trust you. Im gonna deliver the money, then another guy will come and bring the goods. Okay, you go, and tell him to turn on the phone. Is it off? And tell him that if he ever decides to play us like that one time, we will arrange him an "assalamualaikum". He knows. Okay. Tell him we did some digging, that we know everything, about his dad, and we don't give a shit about his father. I'm only a courier. So deliver all this, since you are a courier. Tell him that if in three hours we don't get the product, we'll go hard on him. Tell him that connections won't help. Okay. I sent him a message today. He's replying. Is he replying to you? I don't have a phone on me. We texted in the morning, can't reach him now. I sent him something. A photo. Did he not receive? Telegram says "not delivered". I don't know. I'm telling you, I take the money, I deliver it, that's all. Are you driving? No, I'm taking a cab. Why would you take a cab with all this money? We can drive you. Thank you but I have instructions. Anyways, tell him this: if by 3 pm the product is not here we'll finish his chick off. And if its not here by nightfall- we'll fuck him up too. What chick? Isaad, show this guy the photo you sent me. This is his chick. Our associates dug out her address, work, everything. He'll get wrecked trying to save her. So go, in three hours we are expecting the goods to be here. Her dad is not a General. Nobody gives a fuck. So go on and tell him to turn on the phone. What is money, bro? Just garbage. Take it, I'm not greedy. I have more. But a person has only one life, you know. Lermontov said so. Tell him this: if by 3 pm the product is not here we'll finish his chick off. So go, in three hours we are expecting the goods to be here He'll get wrecked trying to save her. Her dad is not a General. Nobody gives a fuck. What are you doing here? The deal is off. Khazin was murdered. Take the dough. Everything is here? Gonna count? I trust you. I booked everything, all that's left is the tickets and let's choose a hotel. Would you like some coffee? What do you want? Three stars, four? I'm sorry, I haven't decided yet. I got stuck on Colombia, maybe there are some other options? Are you here to collect? Yes, of course. Thailand, for instance. Ever been there? No, just wanted to take a look one more time. There are some very uninhabited places, with unsupervised beaches, white sand, Very popular among the French and Australian youth, they live there in communes What is there to look at? You need to take her. Or else we'll have to bury her like a homeless person, not much to do with the city budget. But honestly, the best option is to go to an island. They are insanely beautiful over there, you know, like in "Avatar", giant green mountains raising above the water. What other options are there? Morocco, for example. Ever been there? No, I haven't. I went last summer, loved it. It's a fantastic country, the scenery is out of this world, the people are welcoming. And the ocean there is perfect for surfing, the best there is. There are wild waves and white houses against the bluest sky. And Marrakesh, a huge ancient city. Narrow streets, like in "One thousand and one night". The markets, the gardens. Yves Saint Laurent has a mansion there, although you are probably not interested in that. Why not? I am. Yes? Yes, it really is interesting. I'll come by later, I just need to do one thing and we'll settle on something. Okay, good. We close at 7, I am waiting for you. Thank you. Good bye, mom. I'm going home. Hold on, I don't understand, are you going out? Obviously, what is hard to understand We had a deal, Ilya, I also thought we had a deal You think Im joking here? Mom. I am not joking. Mom why are you going on and on about this? I told you I would ground you - I will ground you. What do you mean "ground"? Mom I am not five years old! Mom why are you sitting here idle? I'm gonna be sitting here. For how long? For as long as necessary Mom what is all this drama about? Seriously mom, are you out of your mind? I am out of my mind you say?

I already explained it to you a million times, I did not fail my exams I passed with As and Bs. You are, by all accounts, an intelligent woman, you teach for a living, why can't you understand? I passed everything except one class, That freaking Roman philology. You failed the one subject where I could not help you, it all makes sense. Mom, over half of the class failed! Damn it, I have a retake in two weeks I have already explained it to you, how long is this gonna go on for? Enough already! Until you pass everything, You will spend every night at home. Mom, but... End of conversation. Mom do I go out that often? Damn it, one time we made plans To go out, all of us. I have warned you in advance. Mom, come on, stop this! Why are you sitting here? Stop this mom! I love you so very much! I love you very much too, but I'm not letting you go to the club. Mom! Come on, stop causing a scene! I told you a long time ago, a cool party at "Heaven". Its a night club. Vera is making fun of me That I can never leave the house because my mom won't let me, dammit! Have some sympathy, for crying out loud? I cried out loud over your grades. This is a matter of principle I went through blood, sweat and tears To get you into Moscow State University And now, all of a sudden I get this attitude? What attitude, mom? Can you stop acting like a teacher, at least on the weekends? No, I cannot. Come on mom, stop this. I really need to get going. Get going to your room, and read your textbook, on Roman Philology.
