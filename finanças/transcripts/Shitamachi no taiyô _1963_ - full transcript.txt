This sounds better than any of them. It's quite affordable. Look it says 80,000짜. You're wrong, it's 800,000짜. There are five zeros. But, this won't even fit in my room. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Wow! It says 1,000,000짜! Who on earth would buy these things? Can anyone even afford them? Of course there is, that's why they're here. That's right, aiming higher has no end, since human ambition knows no bounds. But you know, it's fun to just aspire. I wonder why? It's kind of odd, isn't it? It may be just a deception after all. People should have a more steady, practical dream. You're right. For us, buying a million Yen diamond is impossible unless we commit bad things, right? Look, our main office is over there. Aah... On that 5th floor? Uh-huh. In the summer they turn on the air-conditioning. That must be comfortable. I'll have to use this tunnel if I pass the employee exam. Do your best! Uh-huh. What's the connection between your father and the section chief? He was his subordinate in the army. Your father? No, my dad was his superior. I see. That's why the section chief is easy, I can ask Dad to help me with him. Look, when you cross the Sumida River the landscape suddenly changes, doesn't it? Even the sky turns darker. I really want to live in an apartment complex! One in the suburbs. But, I can't afford it with my current salary though. You'll become a regular employee in no time. Uh-huh. - Ma-chan, - Uh? I had a great time today. The sun shining in the industrial district's sky. Is a glass window reflecting the joys and sorrows That ache the heart in that morning. Footstep sounds penetrate the bridge, Aaaah, calling out to the sun. Woo-wooo! Ready for departure! Clickety-clack, clickety-clack... I'm back! - Ma-chan. - Uh? How was it? How was what? I'm talking about your date that I've heard of. Granny, why you chatterbox... I didn't say anything. You're a beauty when you get angry. That's cute. Look at you who chitchat all day long while sunbathing, your suntanned face is pitch dark. It's my golf tan, you know! Grandpa... Granny! I'm sorry to trouble you every time. Nihonbashi troika... Toshio... Do you know where Toshio has gone? Thank you for the treat. Eating while reading will ruin your digestion, you know. I know. Are you okay with scalloped noodles for dinner? Uh-huh. Machiko! Machiko-san! What? Please give me an egg. Again? Could you please stop slurping raw eggs and drink sake? But that's the most delicious. Don't be such a pest. That's lame, you know. Your mom also didn't like it either. Well... Women don't know anything about drinking. Is that so? Uh? Oh my... Kenji! Kenji, get over here! Toshio! Have you seen Toshio? What's with this prank? It was you who sucked its contents, right? I don't know anything about it. Don't lie you liar! Every thief begins as a liar. It wasn't me, I tell you! Of course it was you. You'll get this! About that... Uh... Kunio said he was tired last night so I had him suck this. You should've at least thrown away the empty shell. I forgot about it. You're always blaming everything on me. Where were you until late last night in the first place? At the roundhouse. Why don't you come home early to study? Why don't you follow your big brother's example? One who doesn't study ends up an apprentice... Stop! Just let him be, you've already scolded him last night for that. I told you you're not allowed. Haven't I told you not to turn it on while your brother is home? Toshio... Does Toshio happen to be at your place? A truck ran him over and he died. - Ken... - He's not here. He was playing over there just a while ago. Where did he go? It's already dinnertime. That's worrisome, isn't it? Toshio! You shouldn't say that. What's wrong with telling the truth? Whistler Gen-san is ill. Don't act like you don't know. Circumstances may justify a lie. And you just said that every thief begins as a liar. You rascal, you have to quibble over everything. What's so funny? You don't have to scold him so hard every time. That's not something to laugh at. He's at that age. Yes? Yes, yes. I'll tell him. Hey Kaneko, the head chief is calling you. Yes Sir. [Lunch break siren] 9 - 0 9?! Oh my! How disappointing! Stop fooling around! Just lose for once. That's right, lose! That's right. I'm ready. Last one. Hey, that's not fair! What a show off! Game set. Aah, this is so vexing! And also, Private first-class Kosuge, the one who was on duty in your place... Kosuge-kun, I remember him. He wrote and published a book about the Imphal matter. And I hear it's selling well. That's because war things apparently sell well these days. I just remembered. Since the general director was a young literary enthusiast, you should at least memorize the storyline of the bestsellers these days until the interview. Yes Sir. I hope you're reading the employee magazine. Yes Sir, I'm reading it. Tanizaki-san, I really feel indebted to you about Michio. Not at all, lately when we have to increase the number of regular employees, we have around 50 people applying for just two spots. I have no idea how it works, but please, I'm counting on you. We're going to be late again. Ma-chan. This is my father. This is my close friend, Terajima-san. Thank you for looking after my son. You're a factory worker? Yes. What's your hometown? It's Tokyo. I see... It was a pleasure meeting you. Likewise. See you later. Hi. - Sir, keep up the good work. - Keep up the good work. Terajima granny! Uh? This is terrible. Your grandson was retained at the police headquarters. - Headquarters? - Yeah. Did he get lost? That's not it. What to do now? Someone has to come and get him but you wouldn't understand a thing. Let me see... And you are? I'm Terajima. I'm Terajima Kenji's older sister. Have a seat. Terajima is... You? Excuse me... These kids stole this toy from the model shop. It's very well made. Who wouldn't want one? So your family has 5 members? Yes. How much is your father's income? Around 28-29,000짜. And you're working to help with the bills, right? Yes. Then you shouldn't have much money problems. Did anything like this happen before? No. Is there a reason why your little brother would do this? Then, do you have a complicated situation in the family? No, we don't. Although our mother has passed away, everyone in our family is earnest... There isn't anything that people can reproach our family. Only I am - Ken-chan - Your... dear, Durable and long-lasting... What a stubborn fellow. Kenji, say something! The kids from under the fire tower are the bad ones. It's their parents' fault. They can't see what's under their noses. You were enticed by the others, right? By Ishii-kun maybe. Ken-chan is always like that. Enticed or not, stealing is what thieves do. You say that, but anyone would want to have that locomotive. Is it okay to steal something that you want? Then I'll go to the bank tomorrow and steal some bundles of money. Dad, how can you say that? Enough already! I can't study. Ken-chan. Ken-chan, why don't you tell me when you want something? It'll be useless anyway. When brother wants a book you buy it right away, but you never buy me anything. That's because... he's applying for college next year. This time is special. You're not buying me anything because I won't apply for college? How can you be so twisted? When your brother was in junior high school, if he wanted something he'd buy it himself by saving money from delivering newspapers, you know. The astronomical telescope, the fountain pen too. You remember that, don't you? Granny, from tomorrow on, don't let him outside when he returns from school. He's grounded for the time being. We'll have him study at home. You say that, but he's not the type to study, you know. I hope the neighbors haven't heard about it yet. Don't go around yapping about such a shameful thing. I won't tell anyone about it. Granny, thank you for the salt the other day. Not at all. Today was terrible, right? What do you mean? I just heard about Ken-chan. You must be really worried, right? It's the rebellious age mentioned on TV... They're back? Then, have a good night! I also think it's his friends' fault. Acting as a substitute mom must be rough for you. The feeling I had when I went to the police... I thought they were going to arrest me too. It happens a lot. Don't worry about it... There they are again. The same gang as before. They're disgusting. You don't even mean it. They're making fun of us. I see... Kenji-kun does seems kind of gloomy. In a twisted way. He doesn't resemble his big brother even a bit. There's nothing I can do about his poor grades, but... In short, he doesn't have a purpose. So he's just frustrated. What could it be? I wonder what is he lacking. He's not answering me whenever I ask him. Can't you ask his teacher to group him with some nice kids? But that won't work if it's done by force. Say, could you please meet and talk to him? If he meets with you, he might tell you things that he can't tell us. Yeah, you may be right. But, the employee exam is in a week from now, right? I'm currently on the last spurt, so I don't really have any time to spare. That's right... I'm sorry for being inconsiderate. No, that's okay. My dad praised you, you know. Uh? He said you're a healthy nice girl. This is a good one. Howdy. What do you want? I'm... Ryosuke Kita. So what? Will you go out with me? Give me a break! Wait up! Why are you running away? No... Get out the way! Wait up! Give up already. I'll scream! Don't touch me! That's improper. Purse snatcher! That was scary! I was chased by a delinquent just now. Oh my, how awful. You have to scream out loud when that happens. But... Youngsters nowadays only make a racket with their twist and bossa nova. Buddy, twist is not a bad thing, you know! I like it very much. Watch me. You're good! Good! Good! Granny, is Kenji staying quietly at home? He went out a long time ago. I guess that was inevitable. That child is a pain in the neck. Where have you been? At the roundhouse. What were you doing at the roundhouse? Looking at the locomotives? Did you go alone? You went together with the kids from under the fire tower, right? With Yamashita-kun from the river bank? Tell me. Tell us the truth. It wasn't the roundhouse, right? You went to a much worse place, right? You're wrong. You can look at locomotives, but you also need to study since you're a junior high school student. That's true. With the state you're in, your sister will never be able to get married. No one's stopping her, you know. How dare you say that!? Don't you know the hardships she's going trough, huh!? Kenji! Ladies and gentleman, a wonderful present has arrived for the bride and groom. Just now, they have successfully won the Hikarigaoka Housing Complex lottery. With a 200:1 competition rate, they seemed to have given up any hope. But I think the Heavens brought them this good luck to bless their start in life. Congratulations! She looks so happy! An office worker is the best marriage choice after all. So you can't get into an apartment complex if you don't earn at least 30,000? That's right. A woman's happiness depends on the man. Don't you agree, Machiko? She already has someone, so... Silly! How about you, Chieko? Me? I think I'll be miserable with an office worker. How so? I'd like someone manly who does the work himself. I wouldn't care if he wore a jacket and rubber boots. Oh, is that what you'd like? Why? It's all about the money. He's gotta have money. That's just trivial. Why are you so fixed on money? Oh, so you don't want to have money? Everybody would want to have money. Right? Uh-huh. But you know, aiming higher has no end. Since human ambition knows no bounds. Then, what do you think? I would be fine as long as we won't live in extreme poverty. And without worries about the future. I see, that's so like you. Are you saying it's wrong? Why? Are you willing to marry any lewd old man as long as he has money? Don't be absurd. That's not what I'm saying. - That was boring. - A total waste. Ah... Let's go. Yeah. Let's follow them. Let's go. Let's go. Howdy. We saw you. You sure are lewd. What are you talking about? We went in thinking it was a French film. And it was horrible. My education won't allow that. You're not fooling us. I'm not trying to fool you. That's right, you were into oriental stuff, weren't you? This is who I am. By the way, do you know a Machiko Terajima? What is it? I am Terajima. Oh, what a coincidence! I know your little brother very well, you know. Uh? - Right? - Yeah. He often comes to play at our place. You're lying. I'm not lying. He says you're not his real sister. Thinking about it, she is a beauty, right? That's true. You don't resemble that kid. - Let's just go. - They're just delinquents. We're not delinquents, you know! It says Saemon Suzuki. What a weird name! Then, are they the ones who taught him bad things? I'll show him when I come home tonight. Scolding him now would only make it worse, I think. He's a real pain. Machiko, what should we do? Watch out! Should I go meet and talk to him? - With that factory worker? - Uh-huh. I don't now... What to do now? I don't really know your little brother. But... The guy over there knows him well. I'll call him out for you. Ah... Why? Why shouldn't I play with him? I'm not teaching him anything bad. It's still bothersome. My little bother is very twisted right now. That's not true. He's a good kid. No he isn't. That kid is frustrated and kind of gloomy. He isn't gloomy at all. He's a bright and funny kid. You don't know anything. Please, don't play with him anymore. It's making my family anxious. Hmm... That's right, you're not his real sister after all, right? Huh? Your little brother must be an orphan. That's why you don't understand... Did he really say that? Yeah, he did. It's a lie. A preposterous lie. What does he mean an orphan? That's not true. We are full-fledged siblings. Why would he lie like that? Huh? It's a lie? Obviously. We look alike don't we? I see. So it was a lie. He fooled me good. What's so funny? That's not something to laugh about. But you know, children lie often. I know I did, quite a lot. That's because you're a delinquent. Children have to be honest. Lying is the worst. Then, does that mean adults never lie? So you haven't told a lie, not even once? Hey, Ryosuke! We have to pour the molten iron. Hi-ya! It's my choice whether to play with your little brother or not. If you don't like it, just stop him from coming here. Yeah. I'm sorry for startling you the other day. I... have always wanted to become friends with you. Sorry, just give me a minute. Okay. I'm worn-out. What is it? Is there something you want? No. It's not something worth disrupting your study over. Is that so? Studying must be a pain. It's not easy to surpass someone. - Do you know what a golf widow is? - Golf... what? Widow... it means widow. Her husband goes every Sunday to golf with company associates. So his wife is always alone on Sundays. Ah, I see. So Katsuko is also a golf widow. Isn't that amazing? I'm so happy. Thank you for coming all the way here. Today after a long time, I can finally chat. I was looking forward to this day since a week ago, you know. - You're exaggerating! - Come on Katsuko! I'm not lying, I mean it. Yeah right. Deep down you're thinking to get rid of us before your husband returns. That's not true! I mean it! I really am happy. What's wrong all of a sudden? Oh my. Did something happen? I wonder what's wrong. Is lemon okay, or maybe milk? I want milk. Maybe things aren't going well with her husband. Sorry about that. Seeing your faces made me miss the old times. - What old days? - It was just the other day. I put milk in yours. Here you go, Fuyuko. Are things going well with him? Uh-huh, of course. I can't wait for him to come home. Tsk, so you're affectionate after all. Ouch, it hurts. My legs are numb. Can I remove my stockings? Go ahead. It's so nice in an apartment complex. I'm so jealous! It's just a phase. Everybody goes through that phase. Uh-huh. Wow, Machiko, look at these amazing cosmetics! Let me see. Wow, you sure use some expensive ones! He's very particular about hairstyle and makeup. He says not to be stingy on them. What a good person he is. A man's job sure seems to be difficult. Even though I wait for him wearing makeup he's always tired and falls asleep immediately. Oh, you're waiting for him wearing makeup? That's right. Hmm... Oh my, aren't these sleeping pills? Sometimes when I can't sleep... - Haven't you heard of thalidomide? - Don't worry, it doesn't have that. Say, why do you have to wait for him wearing makeup? I mean, that's what he wants. Every day? Maybe he gets bored with my usual look. Hmm... You're wearing makeup so he won't get bored? Is that wrong? There's nothing wrong with a woman staying pretty. But, you're much prettier without makeup. You already know that. I'm sorry, but, a natural face is much better. Not from a man's perspective. But didn't you get together with the one you like? Well... But it's different from when you're in love. You'll understand once you get married. Is that so... Ready for departure! All aboard! Woosh-woosh-woosh... Clickety-clack, clickety-clack... Wooo! Assistant, eyes on the pressure! The pressure is OK. Alright! Next station is Sendai! Sendai! Wooo! Wooo! Woosh-woosh-woosh... Wooo-wooo-wooo! Woosh-woosh-woosh... Clickety-clack... Assistant, eyes on the speed! Wooo! The speed is 40. Hey, Ken-bo, that's enough! They're gonna spot us! Next station is Morioka! Morioka! Ueno is next, you know! We'll just make another lap. No, no! Next station is Ueno! Passing through Akabane. Signaling: Wooo... So it wasn't you... Gone are my friends from the cotton fields away Gone from the earth to a better land I know I hear the gentle voice is calling "Old Black Joe!" I'm coming, I'm coming, for my head is bending low I hear the gentle voice is calling "Old Black Joe!" Gone are the days when my heart was young and gay Sorry for making you wait. Have a seat, Saemon-chan. Saemon... Well... I'm weak to that... Umm... and Saemon-chan... I have the Suzuki name, you know. And this Suzuki name... Umm... So you were also here? Yes. Ah... Hello, hello! I see... Hey, could you lend me a light? Just lend me a light already! You should've told me you're waiting for someone. It's fine. It's not that serious. Yeah right, you can't fool me. Then, I'm going now. Just stay a little longer. - Are you already leaving? - Yes. Good-bye! Good-bye! She's such a good person. Hey, stop right there! Wait up! Hey! Get them! Hey, stop! Hey, stop right there! Hey! Ah! They got me! You know, when I was around your age, I stole some eggs. And I got chased for it. This reminded me of that. Eggs? From a store? No. From a henhouse. I sneaked in quietly during midnight, I thrust my hand inside, and then sticked my hand under the hens' bellies and got the eggs while they were still warm. Did you steal to eat them? No. My old man was ill, and he had to eat eggs. But we couldn't afford them. Did they spot you? Someone shouted "Hey!" and chased me carrying a stick, so I ran and ran, desperately. Did you get away? I got caught. Hmm... What happened next? My old man came to apologize. "I'll give him a good beating!" he said. Parents don't know how concerned a child is for them. Parents are just a pain in the neck. Why you... - Where's your dad right now? - He's dead. Say, Ken-bo... Uh? - You think dads are annoying, right? - Uh-huh. It's lonely without one, you know. You lied about being an orphan. But he's your real dad, right? Yeah, sorry about that. You even have a pretty sister. You're a lucky one. Ouch! Damn you! You bastard! Come again tomorrow, for the X-ray result. In any case, you can't work in this state. If you really don't want to be hospitalized, you should go to your hometown and recuperate. Yes Sir. Hey, how did it go? Well... I had to put my head like this. Then... arch my back like this and hold my hands in front like this... Just like I was hugging a girl. Breath in... and click! Behold, parachutes... - Hey, how did it go? - Are you alright? Behold, parachutes conquering the sky! Saemon, what did the doctor say? He said we'll know for sure after 3 days, when the X-ray is ready. That's all? He must've told you more than that, right? That's enough. Mind your own business! Hey there girls! - No! - No! Behold, parachutes... Pervert! How dare you! You overreacting fatty! On your exam paper it says "Solidarity originates from rivalry", right? But don't solidarity and rivalry essentially contradict each other? Yes? That's basically saying to fight peacefully, doesn't it? - No, I meant... - Uh? Solidarity as a human relation. And rivalry, in other words... A work rivalry, in a good way. I see. Next! Kaneko-kun! But in any case, I'm confident that it all went well. I'm glad for you. I mean, they were all smiling cheerfully when I answered the question. - I have a great feeling about it. - Then, it's as good as settled. - Yeah. - Let me do it. Besides, section chief Tanizaki is also doing his best for me. This is nice. What exactly? A woman's image when pouring tea is indescribable. Stop it. Long ago, my mother... On the sunny veranda... She used to knit a lot. A woman is most beautiful in moments like those. Say... Let's talk about marriage after they announce the exam results. Okay? Mori-kun. Yes Sir? Have you read the employee magazine? I've read it. But your exam paper didn't touch the technology import subject at all. Section Chief, I... Kaneko, who sits across of you, apparently got better grades than you. It's unfortunate, but, it seems you're just the runner-up. I also did the best I could... But Kaneko's father is an old friend of the executive director. I bet my dad will be disappointed once he hears it. "I won't judge you if you don't pass." "I won't expect you to." he said, but... I'm sure, deep down, he's expecting me to pass. I'm the only one he has to count on after all. But, anybody can fail that exam. Almost everyone failed, right? It wasn't just you. That's just mere consolation. I lost to Kaneko. To that guy... That's because... he's got the hang of it. That's not it, he's just smart. He doesn't even study and plays mahjong all night with the head chief and still gets better grades than me. - That means, I'm stupid compared to him. - Michio-san... Don't talk so pathetically. I'm pathetic anyway. Don't agonize over it. Let's try again next year, okay? Next year? Uh-huh. Don't say it like it's someone else's problem. How so? You're a girl, you have no idea how I feel right now. Why is that? Why wouldn't a girl understand? The entrance exam for a college and company is a life matter for a man. That's not the case for a girl. How so? Isn't it so? For a girl that's just a temporary resort until she gets married. So a man needs to think seriously about it. Michio-san... I don't want to see us hurt each other. I want to be happy with you. I'll go through anything... Just leave please! I'm not in the mood for this right now! Machiko! Oh! What are you doing here? I was waiting for you. Please come with me to a dance party! Dance party? I can't go alone. It's my treat. Okay? What is this about? There's a reason for it. A reason? Let's go! Come, come! - Hurry... - Wait a minute... The sun is glaring down Burning fiercely and intense That town too, this town too Everybody bursts into bright red flames Everybody's joys and sorrows melt down The bright red crucible Is burning today too It burns down, it burns down The whole Earth in a bright red You know Ryosuke Kita, the tall and a little handsome guy, right? Uh-huh. He came to ask me a favor. - He asked you to come here? - That's right. "Saemon is sick but he doesn't want to go home." "It'll be terrible if he stays like this, so I want you to ask him." he told me with a grave look. So he wants you to tell him to go home? Exactly. So you like him. I really don't like it, but I accepted since a life is on the line. But it's embarrassing. The sun is glaring down Burning fiercely and intense That town too, this town too Everybody bursts... Ah, it's Chieko! Uh? What's wrong Chieko? Do you get it now? This means farewell. Liar! You're a scum! Is that all you have to say? Chieko, stop it! Stop... Cut it out! Fumi-chan! What's wrong with you? Did something happen? It's nothing. I just fell for his sweet talk. Silly! What did you see in him? I thought you were smart. You wouldn't understand. Why is that? A straightforward man who does what he wants is better. Way better than a brooding hesitant man. Saemon. Saemon! Aren't you going to dance with her? What do you say, Fumi-chan? The day lilacs bloom Please remember it, okay? Because that is Because that is my birthday Please, stay by my side Please, stay by my side Because if you leave me I will die in my sleep And then, I'll appear forever in your dreams Then, good-bye! Hey, you! Aren't you hungry? Uh-huh. But I'm going home. It's my treat. Okay? Let's eat some soba together. Okay? - What do you say? - Okay. Stop it! Why are you staring? Because you're eating with such a good appetite. Is Ken-bo doing fine? Uh-huh. Do you still think he's a gloomy kid? Uh-uh. I have a favor to ask of you. Would you go out with me, just for tonight? I really wanted to play together with you at least once. Just once will be enough. Excuse me! What do you say? Okay? Kita-san, are you single? Uh-huh. What does your father do? He's dead. Your mother too? My mother is doing fine. Where is she? Probably... ... in Hokkaido. We don't really see each other. Besides... She left me in my uncle's care. Don't you want to see your mother? I don't even really remember her. I met her once when she used to work in a restaurant in Mito, but... She just gave me some pocket money and told me to leave. And I haven't seen her since. But... I'm fine as long as she's happily married. Since she's my laundry-loving mother. Hmm... Say... What do you guys think about the future? The future? Uh-huh. I mean, things from now on. What about you? Me? If a girl gets married, she quits her job and becomes a housewife, right? Is that strange? All the girls say that. Working at the iron foundry is dangerous, isn't it? It's easy once you get used to it. You're right. It's must be nice and warm, right? You must be joking! During the summer it's so hot that our sweat turns into salt. Really? Our whole body gets covered in salt... We look like salt ghosts. Do you plan on working for a long time where you are now? Yeah. I thought of quiting a few times, but... I guess it suits me after all. Why is that? How should I put it... I like the moment when the molten iron gets poured. You're right. It's really an amazing sight, isn't it? The moment sparks scatter. Did you see that? I see. It's amazing, isn't it? Ah... A star just fell. A shooting star? Can you even see that from here? I'm not lying. It made a sound. The star? Uh-huh. What kind of sound? Rurururu... Do you know when I met you for the first time? When? Around the end of last year's summer. That long ago? Yeah. It was in a train. I was sitting down. Because of a poor operator... When the train came to a sudden stop, a girl fell in her knees with a bang. And that was you. I don't remember it. At that time, a soap fragrance came from your body. I just can't seem to get it out. It was a nice fragrance. We're leaving. Bye. Could we meet again? Ah, that's right, it was just a one time deal. Good-bye! Do you have a boyfriend? Do you have a boyfriend? Are you going to marry him? Are you going to marry him? Michio-san. I'm sorry. Uh? What for? The thing yesterday. No, it was my fault. So? Are you feeling better now? I've already given up. Hey. I hope you won't tell anyone about last night. Who knows. Come on, I beg you. Even if I won't, someone else will. Then I guess I should also tell Mori. Tell him what? What are you talking about? I saw you last night. You were walking together with a strange man in Asakusa. You really are despicable. Are you okay with getting dumped? You know, Michio-san is nothing like you. Don't lump him together with you! Oh, I see. So Mori is a great guy, right? But you also have such a strange taste. He's just an overly serious guy, you know. The employee exam is all about being to the point. So what? You go become an employee or whatever, and just go to the main office! Toshio. Toshio. Where's Toshio? Uh? No idea! It's dangerous doing that over there! Hello, Machiko speaking. Oh, it's you Granny? What is it? Huh?! How is it? Does it hurt? According to my investigation, the accident scene... Yeah, I understand. How is it? Does it hurt? Grandpa! Grandpa! Can you see me? Are you alright? It's me, Nobu! It's me, Nobu! Doctor, how is it? Is he alright? I'm not sure. We'll have to see his head X-ray first. Doctor, I have a favor to ask of you. How about this. I'll pay all the medical expenses and settlement money. So, can't we just keep this between us and deal with it off the record? I don't know what to say. I have a reason for it. Ma'am. I'm sorry Ma'am. I'll take full responsibility, so, could you please keep this off the record? No, it's our grandpa's fault. What have you done? How did you find out? Well... That man is Terajima-kun's acquaintance, so she called me. - So the company doesn't know yet, right? - Yeah. Please don't tell the company. Tell them that nothing happened, okay? I beg you! But... You know my situation, don't you? My employee appointment isn't official yet. Come on, I'll owe you one. That old man isn't hurt at all, anyway. Come on, I'll really owe you one. I'm begging you. Okay? Not to tell the company, you say? That's impossible. Come on, I've already settled it with his family. But... You've left the company car in front of the hospital. Everything will be fine as long as you stay quiet. Okay? It's you, right? Your license. Hello, General Affairs Section. With section chief Tanizaki, please. Hello! Why on earth did he go out on the main street? Uh-huh... He should just stick to this alley. This reminds me of Toshio-chan's accident... Indeed. Must be fate. - But I'm really glad it's nothing serious... - Yeah. About yesterday... They're here. Excuse me, is this Tamura-san's house? This looks like it. Hey, that's looks like 2,000짜 to me. You can't buy that with 2,000짜, it also has melon. Apples too, it's 100짜 a piece. We're extremely sorry for what happened... I apologize. This is a lot more different than it was with Toshio-chan. Just as you'd expect from a major company, right? That's luxurious. It's pouring. Granny! Welcome back! What happed with Gen-san? It was nothing serious, he's alive and kicking. - Is that so? - Yeah. That's good to hear. Your company also seems huge. I wonder how much will they give. Let me see... Around this much, maybe? 500,000? 500,000? Don't be absurd! If they were to give that much, I'd gladly get ran over too. But their car might not want to run you over. - What if I ask nicely? - No, that's no good! Granny, how can you guys talk like that? Isn't it sad? Ganging up and thinking only at stuff like that... What are you saying? We're all worried about his compensation... How can you laugh like that if you're worried? Isn't that cruel? It's too pitiful. - That's right, I have to go home. - Ah, me too. Then, if you'll excuse me... Ma-chan! The one who was driving was Kaneko. - Is that so? - Uh-huh. All right... All right... Ma-chan, because of this accident, Kaneko will be disqualified. Huh? It's just by chance, but now I can become a regular employee. The section chief says so too. Ah... He was in such a panic... What a cunning fellow. He even begged me to cover it up. He ended up in such a pitiful state. Hey, we're leaving. Yes Sir! Dad... Uh? Poverty is awful, right? What's wrong with you? That's obvious. No one likes poverty. How about we marry you off to someone rich? No, to be honest... Well, when picking a marriage partner an office worker will be best. "Look for a big tree when you want shelter" they say. When Mom married you did she really thought an office worker is best but still chose you in the end? You silly! When we... Dad, I'm being serious. It was a love marriage, wasn't it? Uh? Uh-huh. But you know, she had quite a hard time because she married with me. Her illness drew from exhaustion. So you don't want me to go though such a hard time, right? I also want to have money, you know. I want to live even just a little better. But, if I were to marry just for that I feel I'll lose something more important. You'll know that after you get married. "After"? Then... I wonder if Mom resented you. Hmm... She wasn't someone who'd think like that. She did told me "Thank you" before she died after all. "Thank you"? Did she really say that? Yeah. - I feel so sorry for Mom too. - Uh? Toshio! Toshio. Have you seen Toshio? Announcement: Yamagata Ichiro Mori Michio These aforementioned are hired as regular employees and appointed to the main office. April 5, 1963 Director of Personnel Department Section Chief, thank you very much! I guess you'll inform your father right away. Yes Sir! I can finally bid farewell to that run-down apartment. I'll move right after I go to the main office. To a suburb with a blue sky without smokestacks. What's with the long face? Aren't you going to congratulate me? Congratulations. I'm glad for you. Is that all? Sorry. I was recalling the Michio-san from a few nights ago. You were so disappointed... And today you're like a different person. Isn't that obvious? That's what exams do to you. Crying or laughing over a one place difference... It's no use resenting somebody for it. You didn't say anything like that the other day in your apartment. You resented Kaneko-san a lot. Ma-chan, you can't forget about the Kaneko matter, don't you? Let's go over there! Hurry up Dad! Slow down! Be careful! I don't really like Kaneko, you know. But, I feel sorry for him about that accident. However... He failed and I passed. It couldn't be helped. That's how the world works. Just forget about the past. Today is the day I promise to marry you. Say... You'll marry me, won't you? Wait. Wait a moment. Why? What for? Let's suppose... If you had failed the exam. Would've you still had intended to ask me to marry you? No. I wouldn't have. Why is that? If that were the case, I wouldn't have had the confidence to make you happy. I see. Say, can't someone marry based on love only? That's just an ideal. Realistically, that doesn't bring food on the table nor future stability. You'll be helpless in that case. But, that means that there are a lot of people in the world that can't get married. Ma-chan, I really don't want to live a poor life from hand to mouth. - You already know that... - I don't want that either. I'm not saying I want to be poor. That's exactly why I took the employee exam. I barely went out with my friends and studied hard for a whole year. But, what about the ones that failed? You wouldn't be able to do anything if you were to think about the others. Your hands are already full with your own matters. Well... it's not like I'm overambitious, you know. I want to leave this industrial district... And just the two of us... I don't mind if it's small... I just want us to live in a nice sunny room. I would also like to live in a sunny apartment complex. But, I don't think that wearing nice clothes, pouring tea and knitting inside a pretty room brings a woman happiness. Why? How can you think like that? - I just don't get it! - You don't? You should just stay quiet and follow me. "Stay quiet"? Yeah. I won't let you go through hardships. I'll definitely make you happy. Ma-chan... Why are you making that face? This is hard for me. Extremely hard. You and I... We are somehow different. I thought for many nights... And realized that you're someone who'll eventually leave this neighborhood. Because that's what happiness means to you. I'll stay here. The industrial district may be full of smoke... Our house may be dark even during the day... The sky may be shadowed... But the sun is shining above them all. That's... what I believe. Ma-chan. Does that mean... you can't promise to marry me? Are you absolutely sure? Thanks! Saemon-chan, get well soon and hurry back, okay? Okay. Hey, Saemon, say something. Come on. To be honest, I don't know if I'll be able to come back. The doctor said it'll take at least a year. Good-bye! The dance party the other day... I'll never forget it, you know! Take care! - Hurry back, okay? - Okay. Good-bye! Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Hurry back! - Good-bye! Good-bye! - Good-bye! - Good-bye! Good-bye! Ma-chan! Uh? You can talk to me if you have something on your mind. Indeed. You always seem to be lost in thoughts lately. If Ma-chan gets sad, everyone else gets sad. If Ma-chan's smiling, this neighborhood will also be cheerful. Right, Ma-chan? Zen-san, that's a pick-up line. Do you guys like this neighborhood? Uh? Living here is nice. - That's because things are cheap here. - Ma-chan, do you hate it? I like it. But... Not because of the cheap prices. That's what I say when I feel like it Bang! Okay, that's enough What's with all these eggs? Kenji bought them. So what? It's normal to use a kid for errands. Nowadays, even dogs go buy things, by using their smell sense. Just put them away. That's not it! Kenji bought them for you. What? Do you know what day is today? Today? I'm not sure... It's your birthday. Dad, you have to thank Ken-chan. He said those eggs are a present for you. It looks like he's got some charming points. You have to tell him something. Right, Ken-chan? That's what I say when I feel like it 3 days at the nightclub until dawn What an unusual thing he did. It's not like he's visiting a sick person, and yet he bought these... Can I have some sake, since I got these? Hey! Ouch, ouch... Why you! Ouch! Ouch, it hurts. - Ouch! - Ouch! It's about time we get up, don't you think? Hey, what's wrong? You couldn't sleep? Did you know your chest hurts when you're in love with a girl? Are those lines from a song? It really does hurt. Just around here. It really hurts. I'll just go for broke! But that girl already has someone. It doesn't matter. Right now, I'm like a blast furnace with all vents blocked. Will molten iron come out, or will it brake when it opens? Which on will it be? The promise was to never meet again. To hell with the promise! Oh my! I hate persistent people, you know! Just go ahead and hate me! You can say it out loud so that everyone hears it! You can do it until I get so embarrassed that I'd feel like running away! What's so funny? I mean... - This is very funny, right? - Right? I'm being serious!

Revealing troubles and dreams It brings happiness in the alleys too. Aaaah, and the sun shines again today. THE END
