BLACK NOON Lorna? Lorna... None too soon from the looks of them. See here, Caleb. Holy Bible Look to the woman. To Reverend John Keyes Mother & Dad, 1871 Literally sent from heaven. This man is a minister. Joseph. It's alright, Reverend. We'll take care of you. Is she be alright, Mr. Hobbs? Oh, I think so. Bethia will look after her, won't you, Bethia? Of course, Mr. Hobbs. I have no idea how long we were out there. We lost track of time. It seemed as though we kept going we never got anywhere. Well, a desert is all the same. The mountains appeared never to get closer. Then, you must have made a wrong turn somewhere. Got lost. It's happened to others. Mr. Hobbs, I seem to remember... there was a... - My daughter, Deliverance. - Yes, I remember. Hello. Thank you for your help. Please, excuse my daughter, Mr. Keyes, she has an affliction. She can't talk. She can hear and understand everything it is said to her, but she is unnable to speak. Thank you, my dear. I sent Joseph and some of the men out. They've just brought your wagon back. I'd like to go out for thank them. Well, maybe you... maybe you're still a little bit tired. - Why don't you wait a while? - No, I'm all right. I'd like to. All right. Happy to help you, Reverend. Like the Book says: "gather up the fragments that remain that none be lost". Joseph, if you hadn't gathered up my wife and me, and brought us here, to... - San Melas. - ...San Melas. I've been through many western town, but I never quite seen a thing like this. Well you see, Reverend, we are from New England. Connecticut. Some of our buildings here, our mode of dress, even our speech... It's hard to break old ties. Hello, Mr. Hobbs. - Hello, Ethan. How are you? - Fine. How are you today, sir? Fine, thank you. Hi, Joseph. Well, Ethan was injured in the runaway wagon. I'm afraid he'll never be able to walk again without those crutches. One of a series of misfortunes that struck our village lately. Misfortunes? Well I don't want to trouble you with our problems. I'd like you to tell me. Well we worked in mine here, gold. Not the richest mine in the world but enough to sustain the village. And it played out. Doesn't pay now to even work it. Tell the Reverend about the church, Caleb. Some time ago our church burned down. Shortly after our minister took ill and died. Like the book says, Reverend, "we have suffered many things in vain". Let's look on the brighter side, Joseph. Now when we found you in the desert, the minister we had hoped that you might stay with us and... - Caleb! - help us. Caleb, he's coming! Moon's coming! I'll go to him. What do you think he'll do? I don't know. Just remain calm and tell the others to do the same. This may be the worst of our misfortunes. There's no more gold, we're shutting down the mine. It's the last of your share, I'm sorry. I'll be back. We've nothing more to give you. I'll be back. Please leave us alone. Moon, "wickedness proceedeth from the wicked" "but our hand shall not be upon thee". Moon, he's an old man, he meant no harm. Just an old man! Let him go! Let go, you'll kill him! Stop it! Let him go! Let him go! - Thank you, Reverend, thank you. - Let him loose, you'll kill him! Thank you, Reverend. Thank you kindly, Reverend. Reverend? So we got a preacher man among us. Let him go. Let him loose. I'll let him loose when I'm ready. I'll be back, preacher man. You all right, Joseph? I'll make it, Reverend. Thanks be to you. John, I'm sorry to get you involved in this. That's hard to believe. It's hard to believe that one man, one... lone man can exact tribute from a whole town. You saw the way he handles those guns you know the kind of man he is. If it wasn't for you, Reverend, I might not be among the living. Where's the law? Don't you have a sheriff? Only a man. Me. All right. Moon has two guns but the people of San Melas have guns? We don't believe in violence. "He who lives by the sword dies by the sword". I know Joseph, but do you believe in paying tribute to evil? You're right Reverend. Moon is evil but so long as we had a gold to give it seemed the easier path. I know now that you no longer have the gold. What are you gonna do? I don't know. Haven't you sent for a marshal? We're such a small community, so far off the beaten path. But Moon said he'd be back. Yeah, I know. Reverend, what were your plans? Where were you and your wife... What was your destination? Saguaro. Minister there is retiring in the year and I'm going to assist him till then. Thank you. Well, you be staying a while, at least until Mrs. Keyes is able to travel on. Now I was just wondering, you said a while back you might be able to help. I think you can. How? As you know, the people of San Melas have been very depressed lately. I think it would be a great comfort to them if you could conduct the services this Sunday. A great comfort, Reverend. Of course we've no church to offer you, but I'm sure we can find some suitable spot. I would consider it an honor. Excuse me sir, it's your wife. She's asking for you. Thank you. He's certainly a fine young man. The last thing I remember is broken wagon. And sun. Oh Johnathan, that sun still burns my brain. No, honey, don't even have to think about it. I'd like to think about us getting better. Soon, very soon. Are we in Saguaro? No, but we're with friends. The place called San Melas. What happened? It's... It's nothing, I'm all right. How did you get us here? I didn't. Some people found us. In the middle of the desert? We were very lucky. Now you have to get some rest. - Johnathan? - What? I never lost faith in you. Good morning. Good morning, Deliverance. Good morning Jacob, Joseph. - Morning. - Morning. Mr. Hobbs thought you might have need for some of the things in here. Oh, that's very thoughtful. Oh, you can put it anyway. What a beautiful candle. It almost seems a shame to burn it. Deliverance makes those candles herself. - She does? - Yes ma'am. Out in the shed. I'd like to watch you sometime. I was just working on the sermon for tomorrow. You're gonna be there, aren't you, Deliverance? Is there anything else we can get you, ma'am? No, thank you, Joseph. We won't be in San Melas that long. Thank you. He opened his mouth and taught them, saying: Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are they that are persecuted for righteousness' sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye. When men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you, for my sake, falsely, for my sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven! Ask, and ye shall receive, seek, and ye shall find, knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh, receiveth, and he that seeketh, findeth. My friends, you have done me a great honor asking me to come to speak to you this day. I know this is not the best of times for you. You have been visited by misfortunes as hard as a piece of the nether millstone. There is darkness at noon but you must not lose hope. You must not give up. You're not forgotten. You are not lost, I know. Just a short while ago it seemed that my wife and I were lost, hopeless, abandoned. our bodies too weak to move, our spirits shattered. But there is a strength within if only you will summon up that strength. For there is hope in the midst of despair, there is a candle in the darkness, there is drink on the barren desert, there is balm in bitterness. Your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions and walk with faith. Faith! Faith. Draw upon that spirit within! Lift up your eyes unto the hills! Arise and renew your strength. and you shall mount up with wings as eagles. Hearken unto te voice of my cry! Behold! Rejoice. You shall walk and not be weary. You shall run and not be faint. For the darkness shall be lifted and your crooked shall be straight. Well thank you all for coming by, but it is getting kind of late and it's been a trying day for Mr. Keyes. - Good night. - Good night. We'll see you all again tomorrow. It's a miracle, Reverend. Like the Book said, "you gave feet to the lame". No, not really. I didn't do anything. Yeah, you're too modest, John, and giving us hope. This may be the beginning of better times for us. I'll tell you something else, the whole town wishes you were staying. Well thank you, but that's impossible. Nothing's impossible, not after today. I think I'd better look in on Lorna. She's not feeling well again. Yeah, too much excitement. Should have stayed in bed a few more days. You're probably right. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night, Joseph. - Good night. Oh, I haven't seen Deliverance this evening. Oh, she's probably working in the shed. Please say good night from me. Deliverance, I don't mean to disturb you, I just wanted to say good night. Well, thank you. It's quite a little workshop you have here. Now, I haven't seen candles made since I was a little boy. How are you, cat? This is more like a sculpture, isn't it? Hey, it's something. That's beautiful. Well, as I said I... I just wanted to come in and say good night to you. Oh... Ethan. Yeah, he's a wonderful boy. I'm... I'm glad he was healed. No, I didn't do anything, he... he healed himself. No. You want to know if I can help you. Deliverance, I wish I could. I only wish I could. Could you ever speak? This happened when you're very little one. I'll find out more from Caleb. Well, as I said, I just wanted to say good night. You... your don't work too late. Lorna? Lorna, you still awake? Yes. I was just waiting up for you. Well I... went outside for a while. I get some fresh air. It's a beautiful night. How you feeling now? A little tired and weak and there's that throbbing inside my head again. I think Mr. Hobbs was right. About what? He said you got out of bed too soon. Hey, you know I wouldn't miss your sermon. Johnathan? That boy... - Ethan. - Ethan. Well, what do you think happened? I don't know. I think that it was your strength that went out to him when you spoke. "The voice of my beloved." "Behold he cometh" "leaping upon the mountains, Skipping upon the hills." You remember, Johnathan, don't you? I remember. The Song of Solomon. Our song. Oh Johnathan, we're gonna be very happy in Saguaro. Yes. I... would like to go there as soon as possible. All right. Now, why don't you just close your eyes and get a little rest, eh? Johnathan, what is it? I had a dream. It's more like a nightmare. You're wringing wet. Yeah, I might, I just laid down for a while and I fell asleep. Is there anything I can do? No, you already have. Come on. You come on back to bed and I'll sit up with you until you go to sleep. Go blat... som blat... carradon... go loos. Com blat... go blat... go loos... carradon... carradon... carradon... Go blat... som blat... carradon... go loos. Com blat... go blat... go loos... carradon... carradon... carradon... Go blat... som blat... carradon... go loos. Lorna? Honey, you all right? Oh Johnathan! She must've been walking in her sleep, Reverend. No. No, I wasn't asleep. I saw them. Johnathan, I was awake. I was awake and I saw them. It's probably my fault. I had that dream and you went back to sleep... No, I tell you I saw them. Lorna. Right here. Right here. They... They were four and they... they're wearing robes and they had candles and they had masks on their faces. They were like animals. There was a goat and that owl... You still feel the effects of the sun that's playing tricks on your mind. No! No, I saw them, Johnathan, I saw them! Right here. Right on this stump it... it was a dead owl. It's been a trying day for all of us. Don't you look at me like that! Johnathan, I saw them, I swear to you. Deliverance was here. Deliverance. Deliverance, please tell them, please! Johnathan, believe me! - I believe you. - Johnathan! - Things will look brighter in the morning. - Johnathan, I swear to you! - I swear to you I saw them. Please believe me! - We'll go inside and we'll get some rest. It's all right. You do believe me, don't you? Johnathan? I said that you do believe that I did see something out there last night. Yes, I do. Thank you, Johnathan. It's very important to me that you believe me. You're very important to me. The most important thing in the whole world. We're not going to stay here much longer, are we? No. There is something about this town and these people. Don't you feel it? No, I don't. - Caleb's the warmest, most cherished man... - Not Caleb. Then who? Never mind. Come in. Good morning sir, good morning ma'am. I brought you your breakfast, ma'am. Oh, the... the others have eaten, sir, but I... I'd be happy to fix you some breakfast, right away... I'm not hungry. Yes sir. Johnathan, would you please bring me some paper and your pen from the desk? Why? I want to write Reverend Mason and let... No! Just to tell him that we're going to be delay. That's a good idea, dear. Well, I'll fetch them for you, ma'am. Thank you, Bethia. Yes sir. I'm going out, dear. Feeling better this morning ma'am? I'm just fine. Well now, come along, eat your breakfast, ma'am. It'll give you strength. Morning, John. Morning. You don't believe she was sleepwalking. Well, if she was, there was somebody else out here too. What do mean? It's candle wax. Oh, you'll find that all over the yard. Deliverance's shed is just over there. She often gives wax to the children to play with. Maybe they're playing right here last night. John, I'm very fond of Lorna. This is a fine girl. Well I honestly think she's still affected by the terrible ordeal in the desert. Yeah, maybe I am too. Caleb, this affliction of Deliverance's, how did she get it? Well, as a child she... had a lot of bad dreams. Nightmares, I suppose you'd call them. We'd ask her what they were about, she'd never tell us. And one night she woke up screaming. That was the last sound she uttered. I see. You think you could help it, John? I don't know. I hope so. I'd be... Well she's everything I have. I understand. We got it! We got it! Where's Caleb? Got go find Caleb and tell him! It's a miracle! Purely a miracle! Where is Caleb? He is at home, Joseph. Come on, Jacob! Caleb! Caleb! Wait till you see what we found! Just wait till you see what we brought with us! Caleb, it's a miracle. What's the matter? What happened, Joseph? We was out at the mine, boarding it up, like you said, so the children wouldn't go in there and get lost. - And it happened. - What happened? One of the old shafts collapsed and Caleb, there was the richest vein I ever seen. - Just look. - Gold! There's more like these? A whole mountain more. Yes sir, Reverend, you brought us good fortune. John, the first thing we're going to do is build a new church. Hey, what's all the excitement outside? I don't know, ma'am. I'll find out. Would you do me a favor, please? Yes, ma'am. Would you see that that gets out the next mail? Of course, ma'am. What are you thinking about? They're gonna start building the church tomorrow. They've asked you to stay haven't they? Yes. Do you want to stay? Well, we have promised Reverend Mason... Do you want to stay, Johnathan? They're fine people. Lorna, they saved our lives. Caleb has opened his home to us, taken care of you. He's treated me like a son. I know. Then what is it? I told you before, Johnathan, this... It's as if they were... from another time, another world. Caleb explained that. Now, when the settlers come from the old country, they bring their customs, their languages with them. These people are from of New England. I suppose. And Lorna, I've been able to help them. They're really fond of me. Of us. They need us. And Caleb said he'd build us a house and pay us more than we could ever hope for in Seguaro. Johnathan, we weren't going to Seguaro for the money. I know, I know. I'm sorry. It's just that I've sent Reverend Mason a letter telling him that we're on our way. But are we, Johnathan? You don't want to stay here, do you? "Whither thou goest, I will go" "and where thou lodgest, I will lodge". "Thy people..." "Thy people shall be my people". "Thy people shall be my people". Lorna, we'll be going to Seguaro just as soon as you have enough strength. Oh Johnathan, I feel better already. Well it'd be a week, two weeks, we still have a lot of desert to cross. Just thinking about all that desert makes me thirsty. You want some water? You know, Johnathan, I think I would. Well then, my darling bride, your husband's gonna get you some water. Johnathan, what happened? - A mirror fell off. - Did it break? I don't think so. At least we're not in for seven years bad luck. Lorna, I'm glad you decided to come out today. Fresh air will do you good. Moon, we got a stroke of good fortune. We found a new vein in the mine and it's a rich one. Will have more gold than we ever had before. And you'll get your share. Moon, you'll be rich. Come back in a few weeks. I'll be back for the gold. I'm taking something else this time. Moon! Oh, that's the Preacher Man. Moon, in the name of decency. Never heard of it. Now you listen to me. The first time you got away easy. Don't push it. No, I won't let you take her. Anybody else want to stop me? Well go ahead! Come on, try it! There it is. Pick it up! Come on, try it. And don't follow us! Because you won't want to see her! He's dead! M'boy. I've killed. Taken a man's life. He wasn't a man. I've killed. But you saved her. You saved us all. He was an animal, a mad dog. Thank you. She's resting now. That's good. Caleb, she's not getting any better. I'm worried. I wish there were a doctor here. Well, the best medicine in the world for her now is you. I wish she hadn't been there today to see what happened. I know. Look. Would you like some tea, Reverend? Never mind a tea, Joseph. What he needs, what we all need is a jigger of brandy. A double jigger. We can never forget what you've done for us. For all of us. Won't you reconsider? Make San Melas your home, will you, John? I'm afraid that's impossible. I... I think it's best, that... we leave all this behind. Well at least wait until the church is built. You've got to do that. Preach the first sermon. The first sermon, John. Will you do that? Please. You had your two weeks, and more. My two weeks? Don't you think I know what's going on here? Honey, what are you talking about? Never mind. We're leaving, we're getting out of here. You hear me? Listen to yourself, honey, you sound like... You don't like the way I sound, do you?! Or the way I look! You'd rather look at someone else, wouldn't you? Lorna, please. Wouldn't you? We're leaving here tomorrow! Just wait until Sunday... - No! - Those people... Those people! Those people! They have been awfully busy. The church is almost finished - and I promised... - ...them! That's all you care about! Well I got enough of them and this place! Lorna, you're not well enough to travel. I will never get well here! - Never! - Lorna... If you're such a miracle worker like they think you are, like you think you are, then heal me miracle man. - I want to help you. I want to help you. - Heal me! Do you? Or you want me to die? - Yes. - Lorna. Then you could stay, couldn't you? - Couldn't you, miracle man? - I love you. - Do you? - I love you. We're leaving here tomorrow! Tomorrow! Reverend! Yes, Ethan? They say you're going away. I wish you wasn't. My legs are getting stronger every day. I bet I'll be able to run pretty soon. That's good, Ethan. I... just wanted to thank you. Johnathan? Are you all right? Yes. Yes. May I sit with you? Yes, of course. Father says you're leaving tomorrow. Yes. Do... do you want to go? Johnathan? Lorna... wants to leave tomorrow. Lorna... is sick. I know that, but she doesn't want to stay here anymore. Do you? Well we... we hope you will, at least till Sunday. Maybe Lorna will change her mind. Well, I don't think so. Johnathan, I've been reading. May I read to you? "I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me." Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field, Let us lodge in the villages. Let us get up early to the vineyards, let us see if the vines flourish, whether the tender grapes appear and the pomegranates bud forth, there will I give thee my loves. That was very good, Deliverance. Would you like me to read more? - It's from the Song of Solomon. - Yes, I know. I... better get back to Lorna. I'm glad you came down, John. I was hoping we could have a little talk. Caleb, I'd like a drink of that brandy, if you don't mind. We'll all have one. "Use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and for thine infirmities." It just too bad it has to be a farewell drink. - Yes it is. - Why does it have to be? Can't you persuade Lorna? Caleb, my wife is very ill. There's just no reasoning with her, and I'm... I'm afraid if we don't leave tomorrow, she'll break down completely. I understand, m'boy. But it's just that you could do so much good here. Somebody else'll have to do it. Well, on that case we'll help you all we can. Your wagon is repaired, the most of your stuff is loaded. You'll have the best horses in town and the map to guide you through the desert. There's something else that's been bothering me. I have an ask to you. What is it? Did you bury Moon? Yes. Thank God. A minister should have said a few words over him. Well, we thought, John, it'd be best for you if you forgot it. Now, when we do get a new minister, we let him do that. Thank you, Caleb, for everything. No, it's we're in your debt. More than I can tell you. Now would you like Joseph and some of the men to ride with you part way through the desert? No, I think it's best we leave alone. Good night. Good night, John. What do you think, Caleb? Joseph, as I said before, I think he's a fine young man. I'm sorry, I'm sorry of what I've done. the Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures, he restoreth my soul, he leadeth me beside the still waters. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow... My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. John, your wagon is outside. Lorna? Well Johnathan, I'm afraid you'll be staying a while longer. Fellows citizens of San Melas, we have come here today to dedicate this new edifice. And at the same time to show our appreciation to a man who's just recently come among us. A man to who we've waited a long time. Man who's has made this day possible. Although his wife is ill and is unable to be with us, he's agreed to say the first sermon to be heard inside these walls and regretfully the last sermon we shall hear from him. I give you the finest, the bravest, the most decent man who's ever come to us. The Reverend John Keyes. I... I am a stranger and a sojourner among you. And who among us can look into another's heart and know what is there? As I... stand here and I look into your faces, faces of trust, of friendship, of belief... I must reveal what is in my heart... for you and for myself, because the heart can be deceitful. My first sermon to you was to be the Ten Commandments. Those laws, that were handed down to each of us to live by. But now, as I think back on what has happened, on what I've done, I cannot find it in my heart to speak of them. Those laws that were handed down to each of us, to live by. I have allowed myself to become the subject of your idolatry. I have deceived, I have lied, I have coveted that, which is not mine. I have killed. I have become... corrupted. Lorna? Lorna? Lorna? Lorna! I'm sorry. Please, come back to me. Please. What... is it? What's happening? It's an eclipse, Reverend. That's what we've been waiting for. We didn't just happen to find you. We changed the road sign. And now it's nearly time for our ceremony. No. No. You're dead. I killed you. I saw your grave. The grave was empty. It was a sham. A game to keep you here. But why? We have a covenant with death. And with hell are we in agreement. Some people call it a "Sabbat". In our ceremony we have needed for a man like yourself. A man who in the eyes of your world is pure, and uncorrupted. But were you, Reverend Keyes? No, in you is the seed of corruption. We merely tended it and nourished it until you fell from grace. Last time it was him. He tried to warn me. We are not from Connecticut. We come from a village in Massachusetts, long time ago. Deliverance... My name is Lilith, the witch that Adam loved, before the gift of Eve. ...som blat... carradon... go loos. Com blat... go blat... go loos... carradon... carradon... carradon...
