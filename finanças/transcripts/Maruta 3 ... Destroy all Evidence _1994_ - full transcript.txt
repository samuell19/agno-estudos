1933, injection unit of kanda normally known as troop of saiholi in harbin, they set up "research academy of germs" and was coded as troop 731 there were a number of doctors and scientists they were all ordered by Japanese government to perform experiments with living human, including Chinese, Korean and Mongolians they called these people "muruda'' these poor people had to undergo all deadly games for example, they used mice to bite and see the level of mice biting on living people or to see the response of killing with all kinds of germs or to see the symptoms of syphilis on women anyway, experimenting on killing people alive is cruel and cold-blooded in 1945, the allied declared war to Japan, us armies captured okinawa island and with the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, and Russian armies marching to manchuria troop 731 was forced to disintegrate and retreat to Japan suddenly In the morning of 9th of August Russian armies suddenly declared war to our Japanese empire our armies in peony lake have resisted bravely but, the swift progress of Russian armies from outer Mongolia seem to be able to arrive new capital before the 14th lieutenant general saiholi, your troop 731 must pass through new capital before this, got it? Yes, general, you needn't worry we'll definitely pass through new capital before occupation of Russian armies even our enemies must blow up the train, we must still drive on as the schedule in case we can't pass through, we will fight with spurs the worst that we commit suicide to keep our secret right, you should let everybody understand we must be alert to stop penetration of spies as we're in critical moment and from information we have in hand as German germ research centre has completely been taken over by Russian and as we've been exchanging information with German thus, the progress of our research unit is exposed too I understand this, general if Russian people get hold of this information they'll surely try to clear this secret the responsibility of troop 731 is to change location, and you troop 100 is to... We even release all horses used for experiments to pass on plague and others to Chinese and Russian as presents right besides Germany, usa is also studying about warfare of germs but in fact, the only country manages to make a bomb of germs there is only we, Japan empire so at this critical moment of the empire being members of troop 731 and commanding unit of kanda and also from Japanese government, we order you to be alert and you must proudly... Keep this a secret, understand? Yes! Ready to shoot! Your majesty, long live! Shoot! Remember, troop 731 of kanda manchuria will forever be a secret...

I don't understand why you few must get hold together? We're from the same village, we've grown up together don't you know members of 731 are all from shiba prefecture? But if you must take ito along, then not only will die he's not the first one actually in order to study these germs, more than 300 of our men have died you know how many maruta have we killed to experiment on these germs? Chinese, Korean... They're material for experimenting, you know? No, they're human being! Remember, they're material for experimenting, they're maruta yes, they're maruta you must bear in mind: They're not human but maruta What did you just say? I said they're not material say again! Aren't they not the same with you?

No... we mustn't surrender We haven't lost the war no, we mustn't surrender we Japanese empire will never lose My fellows, we troop 731 of kanda manchuria will never put down our weapons as what we safeguard is the most classified secret of Japanese empire from now on, whoever put down his weapon will be regarded as national traitor yes! Akiyama, is this suitable? Why not? It's his majesty who surrendered, not us! Right, a soldier is not a soldier if he puts down his weapons don't you claim to be loyal to his majesty? We don't want to die innocently you might have a chance to live on if you put down your weapons you I just suspect if you are a Japanese! Forget it! Tama...

Go ahead! What if Russian haven't occupied new capital? Nut! Yes!

Akiyama, come here drink water Akiyama, try some, see how it is! I can't believe you have such good wine let me have a look it's "general" good wine I think we'd better drink it only when we get back to Japan right, we should keep good things aside keep it? If Russian occupy new capital, we'll be over as long as those guys have arrived, we can not only survive but drink this "general" as well shall we bet? What's the use with betting? We might live on yeah ok, we shall drink this when we're back to Japan What? We must fight? What's on?

Ito should take medicine ito, take medicine Listen, they're Japanese this way Nobody is to move! Akimana, let them get in without order, no one is to open the doors this is troop of 731, not train for refugees are you human? Don't you know they're Japanese?

We've come at the wrong time Why isn't the train moving? There're battles ahead when will the train start? No idea Akiyama, what's in your mind? I think 731 is really masters of the empire then they should protect us These days, wherever we go, battles follows there's only one explanation whoever our enemies are, Chinese, Russian, they just want to block us 731 is the secret everyone wants to reveal Akiyama, what do you want? I want to go in town to get medicine go in town? Can... can you? I'll try ok, do come back early, it's bad if we lose you didn't you hear the sentry said there's battle ahead? It's still quite far away, don't worry - akiyama you are here? I've been looking for you ito is in bad condition, what shall we do? Don't worry, we will have a way Stand there! He looks like Japanese no, move on! What do you want? Carbonic arsenate, sulfadiazine and streptomycin, etc usually Chinese buy these, never Japanese never even soldiers buy these medicine! Yeah, please, sir! Wait a while You come from huang lung province? No, why? It's said huang lung province is infected with plague, thousands of people died huang lung province?
