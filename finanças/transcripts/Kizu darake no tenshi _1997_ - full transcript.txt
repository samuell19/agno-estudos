A private detective who takes all kinds of cases Everyone needs to leave at least 3 to 4 pawns if they want to put the claw on us Hand in now I advise you not to upset this guy Enough It's not gas, there isn't any door-to-door service Can't you just get rid of that bad habit of forgetting fuel-filling? How about JAF payment? JAF! I've got no money Idiot, what a poppycock it becomes... So, it got no differences from walking, right? Just want to ask if... this job really got 10,000 yen as salary per day? Sure It's not salary, it's kind of reward Until when you can have piles of money? If I have money, I will buy you a garage for sure 10,000 yen per day is really impressive But if every time you keep running away like that... Until when you can get that 10,000 yen? I don't want to hit you You've already hit enough, I've known you for five years! You know, at the very beginning you make yourself look so strong But at the end, all you can do is pale to death Or even worse, you get robbed instead You are so annoying I was so na?

I'm just kidding I... Please meet Hotaru Or at least you can pretend to be a stranger Get out of here Don't be like that You aren't a man Can't you just adopt him? Isn't it cool to be a step-father of a little demon from the Triad? Hotaru isn't demon Shit, fuck off Want to go to hell? Bastard Idiot, bite me Shit, damn shit No fucking around What are you doing? Hisashi, where's Hotaru? Go to hell Stop fighting You haven't paid yet What? Hotaru, how serious! He even didn't step out from the toilet Suffering from Neuralgia again So painful Got handkerchief?

You can't come in There's a seminar going on And you need not to use... We meet again, what a coincidence No way, not under such circumstances No Hotaru Hisashi What? Do you want to go to hot spring? I hate bathing Hot spring makes you feel warmer We can never get home if you keep on doing these... So, returned that bike already? Of course Let's go Business trip finished? Not yet, I need to go to Aomori and Hiromae, and have to stay there for nights Get on the car, leave the stupid luggage behind There're lots of testers inside All are trade secrets More, I won't get onto a stranger's car for sure Then I hold them up Elite? I have never thought so Just pretty proud of myself She is proud... So gummy It's surprising for someone who has never got a man's hug to say so I didn't say that Yesterday, all were on you So, go to hot spring with us Come on, I hate owing people No You, idiot Hot spring, I think it's cool Sure I want to go But I won't go Why?

You too! Notjust me! Can't in Awesome It's hot, really hot The phone is ringing Where is it? Which button? The green one Hotaru Being good? Hey, Mitsuru Your call is temporarily disconnected. Please call back later Hishashi, why are you hanging around with a guy like me? I don't know, either I don't know what to do with you Forget it You still have other relatives Maybe it'll be better to stay in Hachinohe At least no fishy smell Have you ever met your grandpa? Never This is just a pair of glasses But I used to change it frequently No worries There's always a way out There's always a way out I go to ask someone, I don't know where it is, be right back It's the forth turn... Kuraidao is now ahead... But he starts dead beating, and obviously slowing down So, the last straight way... Kuraidao, o, o... Kuraidao, o, o... Can't you just laugh? No worries I've heard that whole story Actually Denji is a horse trainer He likes horses more than human being You better stay away It's surprising You ask me to take care of a kid... whom I have never met before What the hell? He's the son of Mr Takuya He's your grandson I'm asking you two why you're taking care of him Mr Takuya asked us to do him a favor You want me to take care of him At first, I brought him to his mother who is going to get married again soon But in vain You do this because of love... or duty? In the very beginning, I was just doing duties Now, I want to wait until Hotaru grows up And go to have some drinks with him You are pretty young, right? Me? Do you want to spend the rest of your life in lies and deceits? Lies and deceits? I can't get you Can I trust you? We can't be trusted The majority of the things that we say are nothing but a bunch of bull And we're pretty weak, we change our mind easily We are just a kind of rubbish, kind of wasting No! Mitsuru isn't this kind of people No worries Sorry, I am this kind of people What's your name? Kurai Hotaru Hotaru Follow me Have you ever rode on a horse? No? Funny? Painful? Hotaru doesn't have xenophobia, he looks so happy Getjealous? It's the forth turn... Kurai Hotaru is coming behind... He is overtaking... So, the last straight way... Cool, look... It's exactly hilt to hilt, between Kurai Hotaru and Kida... Kurai Hotaru, Kurai Hotaru, Kurai Hotaru... Kurai Hotaru, cheer up Kurai Hotaru, Kurai Hotaru... Goosh, nearly dead-heat! He's exactly Kurai Hotaru! So, that's the end He wanted to leave here, and back to Tokyo Takuya was 16 when he left He never came back again since then Some day, Hotaru will also leave here Just stay here before he leaves Good idea, Hotaru Okay, Hotaru? I said okay is okay I'm going to live here So, that's it It would be the best to be back to nature Kurai Takuya is dead? No, I just don't where he is Thanks for taking care of Takuya and Hotaru So, we change the express train at the terminal And then we take the Shinkansen at Morioka station In that way, we can go back to Tokyo within today We've done a good job Awesome, man Got money? I borrowed... I borrowed 30,000 yen from Hotaru It's too bad It's okay Hotaru is rich enough And we've spent much in Hachinohe... You get on first You first Why? You get on first You are so troublesome You too Scissors, rock, paper You lost Someone is waiting for you Thanks for your help Hotaru's not with us now... Hotaru Hotaru Did papa ever shed tears? Did he? Is he dead? Take care of yourself Hotaru Mitsuru Hishashi Hotaru Hotaru's light... Snow silently slides away from the edges of windows... Hotaru, we'll have a drink together some day Drink together Stop crying When will we say goodbye to each other? Is it true that all good time would come to an end one day? Be quick Aomori is that way Tokyo is this way Back to Tokyo Let's go back home... Well, I feel like... I dare not go back Hey, the guy in Fukushin's called Mr Gen, right? I understand everything now, I want to meet him too Let's go No worries We're leaving What are you doing? I don't want to go back home Don't go You don't need me? You didn't say this before Shit, idiot Hishashi, take care I was really upset at that moment Next station is Aomori Goodbye is a good word Hisashi said We'll meet again I changed my route We're going together, to somewhere... I'm waiting for him, who is going to get married next month What? Getting married? Getting married with my friend No pity I quit my job And I've withdrawn from my rental contract of my house in Tokyo And I've decided to find him But it proves I was wrong There's still a long way to go Nothing to be afraid of When Hotaru left me... I have nowhere to go, nothing else to do Life without a goal is meaningless What about him? The guy who was always hanging with you He's so cheerful; I am so envious of him He's fine I'm happier staying alone I was waiting for you at the station before I'm always waiting But luckily I'm still young Handkerchief I've got to go. Good night Let me see you back to the hotel No, I'm cool See you Sorry that we can't lend you money I didn't lend any here But you lent much outside And debts Debts? It's relating... I don't get it What debts... Please Want some glasses? I have different kinds of... Really good We are not doing charity Be careful, I'll light it... Don't fool me around My jacket! Tokyo, Tokyo We drink at Tokyo Bike We bike together And we drink together Hey... Idiot I said, idiot Bye Idiot Idiot! You are really an idiot! What are you doing? Electrostatics! Idiot! You too... What? Throw in this way, the ball will change the direction? Give me the ball Look, this side really looks like Aomori Really? Have a look Nothing at all Throw it Where will it go? In high school, some professional baseball team came to school and searched for buds I took off my jacket And threw fiercely... Look What? Hishashi, let's live together when we're back to Tokyo, eh? Good idea, good to live together The snow is too thick. I can't find it Hey, how long does it take? What are you doing? I'm waiting Where are you going? I don't mind you Aren't we going to live together? Aren't we standing by each other? I want to leave I mean it No kidding, man I've got to go Come on I'm leaving What are you doing out there, no more kidding Enough, I'm leaving now
