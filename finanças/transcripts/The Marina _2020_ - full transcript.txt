Okay my boy. Okay, let's go! Why are you here? To crush these little pieces of shit. And who are they? All of them. Because you... You are the king of wakeboarding, my friend. Fuck yeah! Three, four! Charlie! Charlie? Are you ok? Everything's gonna be fine, man we're coming to get you! The boats have to go in between the breakwaters and the wharf. When near the docks, they throw their rope at us. We tie the moorings to cleats, we gas the boats. After, it's more of a maintenance job... We have to mow the lawn, clean the washrooms, pick up the cans... That's about it. Okay. And you? What's your job? Something not very glorious... I take care of the pumping. -Pumping? Yeah, pick up the shit when you sh-- -Okay, enough. I hope you didn't expect to serve crab and get tipped like a bourgeois. You got here unannounced, it's pretty much the best I can do for you. Come on! God damn it!... Negative waves, my ass... Shit..! Sorry guys, but Noah, your sage will kill us. I'm sorry, but... There's a risk of floods tonight, and since nature is fucking out of control, I've put more sage stems so that the basin doesn't overflow. Are you aware it's not your sage that will prevent the basin from overflowing? No need to panic, you could have just opened the window. Do you give a needle to a junkie? Course not! So, don't give oxygen to a fire. Do I look like I want to end up in the grand-burned squad? Not that much... -Charlie, right? I'm really happy to meet you. Can you hold this? Yeah-- -I have to take care of something. Thank you. What's that smell? Jesus! Noah. What did I told you about the herbs you burn inside? You scare the customers. It's just precautions. -Air me that, it smells funerals. Put your talent in the right place instead of losing your time playing environmental shaman. Pat, you’re going to thank me someday, when all the land will be destroyed, covered with ice, and that your marina will still be fine. Alright, alright. What's your point? You wanna fertilize fertile soil? I like you Noah, but there are limits to trying to make me cry. Charlie? Pat. So, you... Are the boss here. You're his cousin? Jesus Christ. Well, it's a small world. I didn't expect you to come here. I don't have so many cousins... Noah talked a lot about you! You'd think he got a crush on you. But, it would be a little weird. Like a kind of incest. Would it have to be your brother to be incest? Or can it be between cousins ​​too? From the moment it happens in the family, I guess it's incest. Anyway, as they say: "Once with a boner, no more brother!" Speaking of having a boner, Noah told me you're good at making sugar pie. I hope that’s true, otherwise I wouldn't have hired you. Yeah, I'm not bad. -Good! It’s gonna be all right then. Ok, it’s going to stir up some excitement here... Mr. Dufour should be here any moment to renew his contract for pier number four... And I’ve just rented pier number four. It also looks like its cooling water is no longer flowing. He says his drive belt is working well, but to be honest, I don't see what... Maybe the hydraulic cylinder broke. Basically, what I wanted to say, is that's probably just the... Hydraulic cylinder. -Exactly. I can take care of it if you want. -Yeah, sure! Why not. Can you bring that to Juliette? I don't know why we still have to order paint cans, it's not that hard to take care of a boat. Nowadays, everyone can get its boat license on the Internet... Great captains don't drive these things, it's the rich. If I were rich, believe me, It's not boats I would be taking care of. Well on this inappropriate comment, I'm going to go see Mr. Dufour. Come on guys, hurry up! Because... He's going on vacation tomorrow, and he seems really stressed. You gotta be kidding me! You wanted me to find you a job. I got you a job. Hi Charlie, this is Doctor Hudson. As I warned you when we met, the wound in your knee doesn't allow for MRIs. But... if you could stop wakeboarding a bit, and relax for a while... We should be able to do it soon... I know it doesn't help you much at the moment, But... We stay in touch if ever there's anything. Bye. For real, never. Honestly, when I'm online alone with Japanese, it's suicide! It's like playing soccer, but the other team is allowed to use nunchuks. I won't come out alive, that's for sure! Everybody's going wild with this. If she wanna show her tits, then why not? It's not because she's pregnant that they're not sexy. She has lots of stretch marks on the tips, she’s for sure embarrassed. No, no. Really Ju, nobody cares. Worst thing that can happen, is if a guy sucks them, milk will come out. The return of the pendulum, guys. Everyone gets white in the face. C'mon... That's not what I'm talking about, Emilie. -I don't care about Noah, really. So, You're Noah's cousin? Yeah. Do you live at his place? Yep, just for a little while. Where do you come from? From the Laurentians. The Laurentians... A small village. Okay. Saint-Adolphe-d'Howard. Oh yeah. Saint-Adolphe is nice. I think there are lots of things to do there in summer. Yeah, but I can tell you that after 20 years there, there's nothing left to do. Yep, I admit. There was no more Pabst left, I took some Flair. Shit Simard! Flair? Again? That beer tastes shit. Next time, you’ll buy your own beer, big. What are you doing here? I could ask you the same thing? I'm coming to see my girlfriend. Today was fucking weird... I was in the old Chambly's modules... There was a nine year old kid... He was riding like a beast. I’ve never seen that. The next generation wakeboarders being surpassed by the kindergarten wakeboarders. Should I give him a blowjob to go to Western Canada? You bitch... If you're with me only for Western Canada, why do you like putting my dick in your mouth so much? It ain't false. Good point, huh. Charlie! Did we loose you, man? No no. That's okay. I'm used to it with Noah, he's telling a lot of bullshits too. Hey! If it weren't of me, you would be homeless! Don't bite the hand that feeds you. -Oh shit! Now you're homeless? Big drop. I'm just on vacation. You're going to make me cry. I too would like to go on vacation. You're pitiful, you have all winter to go on vacation. You know that I am an artist. I live by the seasons. Someone, bring me inspiration, so that I can get my grants. What are you doing? -What? You're not being careful! We're killing our planet one can at the time! Don't be ridiculous. Says the guy who throws his butts in the basin. Correction, I give my leftovers to the fishes. Okay, okay..! You are so wise Noah. Thanks to you now there are, good cigarette butt tartars. If I weren't stuck with that fucker, I would have already married you, Ju. Well, the "fucker", my darling, allows you to do something other than putting on nail polish, cooking and housekeeping... I'm pretty sure you found your soul mate. Who's the guy who won't get laid tonight? -Oh no. Mily... Emily... It's been three days since we made love. -Hey! Anyway, to get back to what we were saying. I know I may not be the best example. but I really put in a lot of efforts to reduce my ecological footprint. And I’m talking about it. That's the big deal, we have to talk about it! That's what I advocate... What I would like youth to advocate is a doctrine. An ideology! A way of reinventing the world! There’s a fire in our wardrobe, and we're saying to ourselves: "Yes sir! No need to plow the car". But watch out! When summer will be back again, it will be too late. We're all going to be toasted. Noah... Go back to awakening the world with your sage from the dollar store instead of starting a revolution. Well... We love you the way your are my friend! Well that's it! This is only a sample of what to expect, if you spend the summer with us. Hey! He doesn't say it, but he's so excited that he's about to come in his panties! Huh? Huh? Uh. -Well... To your vacation with us Charlie. Are you coming for a swim? No, I don't really like swimming. Come on, big. Come! Are there any cool jobs in Chambly? Yeah man, a shit load. Nice. Do you know anyone who works in one of these jobs? Yeah man, I know a lot of people. Could you introduce me? Yeah, I could... Hey, wo! No! No! Man, I'm sorry. -About what? Well, I should have told you about Pat and Simard. We don't give a shit! We're going to have fun anyway. Anyway, I don't care about them. They're just assholes. It's just that, I don't know... The purpose of me coming here was to get peace. Come on, at least we're together. There are worse things than that in life... In Thailand, there are little girls stoned as fuck stuck on some disgusting uncles' knees. What? Yep. And there are limbless men. No arms, no legs, so-- -Okay, okay, shut up! And don't tell me you don't find Juliette pretty. I had a feeling you two would get along. She’s a bit like you, like... mysterious. Besides, I don't get what's the fuzz about being mysterious. I barely talked to her. Don't go imagine things. There's always a start. A little look, a little chat, and oh..! The little fork ends up stinging in the little fresh meat. Shut up! I'm uncomfortable man, well done. Okay! You're in denial. You don't understand the emotions Juliette makes you feel. Look, I understand, I would just tell you... Go with the flow. I talked to her for two seconds, okay? Two seconds, I barely had time to tell her the name of my village, so... Stop thinking I'm going to fuck her on a dock. Been there, done that. Well, it’s kind of banging on a dock but you end up having the twist! Okay, it's a bit sketchy, but... There’s something healthily human about it, to ejaculate to the rhythm of the waves. What the fuck... Shut up! You're so fucking wack! Stop! Eat your fucking chips. Shut the fuck up! Shit. Do you need help? What? Uh... Yeah, I'm looking for the washcloths, actually. Oh. You inherited cleaning toilets on your first day... Nice. Let's just say I didn't expect to become a marina janitor. Okay. You never had a job, huh? Does it show that much? Well... Your hair are greasy. That means you're not used to get up early to go work. And you look tired. So no, from what I can see, you never had a job. I've never had a job, like, "work" but, there are other ways to make money." Are you telling me that you're working for a drug cartel? If so, I'd ask you not to say anything more, I don't wanna put my family in danger. I'm kidding. Well, I've never done drugs anyway, so I wouldn't be much use to a cartel. You never did drugs? -No. Damn, they're stuck-up in the Laurentians. I thought it was in the woods that people were doing acid. I must have been the only one straight, to not realize it. Enjoy it, because with Noah, you won't be straight for long. No! I asked for two more stands. We're not going to sit them on yoga mats, for fuck sake! I'm sorry, Sir. We're short-staffed. What do you mean, short-staffed? I'm going to show you the final submission. Are you on drugs? Fuck! It's the city's fault. They barely give me enough to feed an anorexic, how the fuck am I supposed to organize a nice competition? Maybe if you didn't take half the budget for gearing up Simard, you'd have enough. Well, yeah. But people don't come to the competition to sit on leather couches. They come to see wakeboarding mannequins. They want winners. If Simard's well geared, he's more comfortable. If he's more comfortable, he wins. And if he wins, we're going to Vancouver. Bing, bang, bang, bing, everybody's happy. Except for the fans who are going to be sitting in the sand. What? Hmm? Oh... You guys think you're so smart. Just get me the folding chairs. Tell the other two, you're on your own. No, you're not going to make me work at your competition? Charlie? Do I look like the kind of guy who'd give you a job to do fuck all? You must be kidding me? Well, let's laugh together. Are you serious? -Deadly serious. And while you're at it, you could make sugar pies... The mayor will be happy. And so do I. Wow. This is gonna be fun. Wakeboarding is the poor people's hockey. What? Can't believe you're Noah's cousin. I didn't know they could mix that much. That's not what happened. His father came to Quebec, he fucked a white woman, and here come the white cousins. Ah okay. Anyway, it’s good to see that there are beautiful young working men, and well-behaved on top of that. You have this in common. There's hope! There are not only morons. Speaking of morons, you'll never believe it. The other day, I was at my daughter's house. We often have small continental potluck parties on Friday, then we watch TV. But... ... I don't know what happened that week, but the recording machine was not recording. Of course, we were disappointed, for sure. But, it's wasn't the end of the world. I call the cable guy, but he doesn't want to help me. He tells me it's not possible to ship me another recording machine for the next day... I don't feel like arguing, I'm exhausted from my week. Can I tell you that I was starting to get on the edge. We are the ones paying for Christ's sake! We can at least expect to be served properly! But no! We get fucked from all edges, all sides! That's not all. The other guy, he tells me to go see... Reruns on the Internets. -The Internets... Yeah yeah. But I... I wanna watch my program on my television, not on my computer! Yes, I understand, it's-- -I don't even understand why we hire these guys. They don't listen when we talk. How can you serve well your customers if you don't understand them, huh? Anyways, don't start me on that. Stories like this, I've lived through a lot of them! I’m tired of being fooled. No more time for that! Baby boomers, baby boomers... Everyone put everything on baby boomers's back... And they leave their parents' house at 26. Me, at 14... I was smoking cigarettes, and I was selling weed. It doesn't seem like it, but I lived my life. All this to tell you that it feels good to be well served after having had bad experiences like that. As long as you are satisfied... You, my... You're something. Look at him, he's so nice. He's got it. Come here, let me hold you. And look at that, see how strong he is! See you soon my little lambs, kisses! Holly shit!... Shut the fuck up! Hey, could she breathe for a moment! You weren't tempted to go to California instead of coming here? South shore pisses of. People are so fucking idiot. The only thing that makes people go wild here, is smoking lead before a math class, or get drunk, and end the evening vomiting in a slightly dirty Mc Donald's. It makes you wanna live, huh? If that reassures you, it’s the same everywhere. We drink to forget we don't know what we're going to do... We drink to regret what we didn't do... Then... When someone does it and not us, we drink to... Forget that we missed our chance. Fucking weird life. Sometimes, I wonder where all these people are going to be in a few years. Do you know? -I see myself with Simard. Well, I don't know... For real, I have no fucking idea. So, you don't see yourself with Simard? -Yes, it's just that... Even if we love each other so much, we live in two different worlds. At one point, wakeboarding will take up too much space, if not already the case... He's living the dream and I, well... I look at him. I won't do this all my life, watching his competitions, that's why it's fucked up to talk about a future with him. Yeah, I understand. At least he's doing what he likes. But... There's a happy medium. If at some point, wakeboarding disappears from his life, I'll still be there. But, the other way around, is not true. It seems to me that a person is not diminished to only what he or she likes? I think. Fuck Charlie, did you tie the moorings properly? -Uh yeah... Uh... It doesn't seem to. -Go get the buoys. Go get the buoys! The what? -The buoys Goddammit! I hope it wasn't the cartel boss who did this to you. Very funny. Besides going in and out of the office, what do you do here? Shit! You know how to talk to women. -Ask Mrs. Castonguay Don't get too many illusions, Noah has already kissed her. Berk. No, no, no... not for real? -Yeah! I know, it's wack, but it's fucking funny. What the fuck! Well! Have you finished your shift? Well... Do you want me... To give you a lift? Uh... Yeah, yeah. Why not. Not right away though, because... I have to help Emily with a boat that has hit the wharf. I have to go and carry her a buoy. Uh yeah, right! Maybe I should go do that. Yeah, maybe. Come on, go! -Yeah. Hey, I'm really thirsty. Shall we drink wine? Not micro-brewery, it pisses off. Blond, red... Or black ale? Okay, I know what we're going to have. -I know you know. This? It's delicious. Wait! What? I'm driving? -Oh, yeah? You just have to show me how. -Turn the key. Give some gas. -That's it? Yeah, are you ready? Uh... Yeah. -Come on! Yes! Woa! Look at that! A shooting star. Where was it? Left or right of the Great bear? -Uh... Look, to the left, it goes to the right. Nope, it's not a shooting star, it's a satellite. You're punch-drunk, a shooting star goes way faster. It seemed to be going fast... I don't judge you, no worries. There are so many stars, like... I don't know, it’s amazing how many there are... That's why I like to come here. There's nothing blocking our view right now... Live... There's legit nothing between us, and the stars. There is a... There is a lake where I live, and sometimes I... I like that. I take the pedal boat, go in the middle of the lake. I lie on my back, then I look at the sky, and... I wonder what could happen at that exact same moment, on another planet. I don't know... It hypnotizes me to think about that. I don't know... It's fucked up, when you think about it. The galaxy closest to us is Andromeda, and that's kind of... Two million light years from us, it's fucking far. If extraterrestrials exist, there are not many chances that one meets them. Good, they won't come to gun us down. No, no, no! That thinking sucks... Looks like in everyone's head, the aliens are just... villains and they want to kill us all, but... We're no better, we kill each other. We should start by managing our own problems here, before looking for some elsewhere. There is for sure no extraterrestrial life form... who'd like to become our friends. No one's down to chill with, uh... Hitler. Bin Laden, uh... Ted Bundy. -Nope, indeed. I was thinking about that the other day, then... I may have a little theory. A theory about... Why don't they come visit us? No, on everything. I don't know... You know, humans in general... I don't know why I'm actually telling you, It really has nothing to do with anything. Go ahead, I'm listening. You know... Humans in general... We think we are more evolved or smarter than animals because we have a conscience. It's absurd. We consider ourselves as an intelligent life form. We really think that the fact we can think and everything it's like it's a quality. We fully value the fact of thinking, and questioning ourselves to find a meaning to our lives. But... I don't know. Imagine if it was not a quality. If it was more, like a defect, a weakness, let's say. Look at it that way. Humans, we ask ourselves all these questions and, logically... When there's a question, there must be an answer. -Yeah. But where everything falls apart is when nobody has the fucking answer of why we're here. We know nothing! It's like we weren't programmed to understand certain things. Like... As if we were missing something. So... I wonder... In what are we so smart? Yeah... Yeah, but no. It's not because we don't understand the animals language they don't ask themselves questions. I don't speak Russian. It doesn't make me less intelligent than a Russian. You know, humans are a crazy thing. With science, we're able to explain molecular reactions, and understand natural phenomena. Of... All that... -All that. But... In a sense that... Our intelligence... is also our ability to learn new stuff. -Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly it! Our intelligence is just different. Look... Why did we invent microscopes? What's the point of doing that? Well, it’s used to see stuffs we wouldn't see with naked eye. Okay. And why do we wanna see these things? Well... To understand! -That's it, to understand! I don't know. I'm not saying that... I'm not saying animals are stupids, far from it, but... Like, I don't know... The... researches on the universe and... Space... All that... It's not a humpback whale that thought of that. It's a dude. It's purely human behavior. So... I don't know... If animals don't try to understand... Maybe it's because they already have the answer. And if an answer is obvious, you don't even have to ask yourself. It's simple, you just... Live. Breathe. There and now, in the fucking present time. I don't know, I just... I just feel like we're the only weirdos to exist without understanding why. Course not. If there are other forms of life somewhere, they're asking themselves these questions too, for sure. My theory is that right now... We're at a stage of human evolution where... we aren't able to understand everything, but at some point, we will be. Like when you understand something as you get older. Maybe the animals have already reached this balance... Oh yes, okay. Yeah. -That's it. We say the same thing. -We say the same thing. Yep, that's it! But... Maybe that in fact, right now, we're cut off from the rest of the universe because... We must learn to live together. You know... Maybe when we're all going to die, it's going to be a kind of evolution towards something else. Maybe it's a cycle, like... fashion, like the seasons, like humanity... Civilizations fall, and are reborn... Yep. You know it's amazing what you just said? Yeah, huh? -Yeah. In the meantime, we have a bunch of stuff to learn, and we didn’t start well. Maybe we just have to, I don't know... Try to be well and enjoy the moment. I don't know, it's tough to be well... I kind a... Feel as if I don't belong to this world right now. So... Have you ever felt... At home somewhere? Having the feeling that you really belong in a place? A place? No. But when I'm on the water, however... It's... It's like I'm alone in the world. I don't think about anything, I have no more problems... As if... Time stands still around me. Hmm... Is that why you came here? -No... Okay, so you just said to yourself: "I'm going to spend a summer in a marina and its' going to be fun." It's complicated. Hmm, Hmm... You? Uh... I don't really know either, actually. I think that... I don't often feel like I belong somewhere... -What? Except when working on my paintings, but it's not really a place... You paint? -I am painting. I like to paint landscapes that had impact on my life. It’s really a hobby, I won’t make a living out of it. You should do an exhibition, see what people thinks about it. No, it's not good enough. Why? There may be people who really like what you do. Yeah, but I'm doing this for myself, not for others, anyway. I think you're afraid of what others might think of your paintings. Well, of course, yeah, I'm afraid. I'm definitely scared! It is scary. Showing it, is like revealing myself. -Yes, but that's what people wants! To know who you are, who's behind the paintings... To know who make them feel good. Yeah... It's easier said than done. And anyway, as long as I don't paint the next Water Lilies, it's going to be a hobby. Well... I guess you shouldn't think about that. When you do what you like, and you work hard... Money comes after. It's tough not to think about it. Adult's number one struggle, is to "support himself". I mean, this is serious stuff. I hope that at some point, the aliens will come to burst the bubble in which we live, and then... Remind us that all of this here is more complex than... the fucking capitalism. -Yes. Thank you, fuck! It's like... People... Well, "we"... always talk about money. See, I just talked about it. I know, it's normal. It's important... People want to live well. But... It's not very often I have a conversation without the word money coming at least once. -Yeah. It's heavy, it's like a spiritual guide. Even if we don’t realize it, just about all of our decisions are based on whether they'll bring in cash or not. It's fucking depressing! Hey, are you down for a deal? Promise we will never talk about money again. And it will never influence our decisions again. Never again. Never again? -Never. Okay, why not? Why not? Deal! -Deal! So, is this the time we get naked, and start a revolution? Exactly! -Yes? To anarchy! -To anarchy! Is that what anarchy is? Do you have beer? -Yep, I have beer. I knew you were going to ask me. There are almost no more left... Grill, grill, my sausage... Grill, grill, my sausage. Grill, grill... You there! Why the fuck face? Sorry, I'm concentrating. I'm visualizing how many sausages it's gonna take me to weave a noose around my neck. Don't ever joke like that again, man. It's important to believe in life, bro. Light can only come out of darkness. That means life always ends up being right in the end. Thank you, man. Hey! Yo! Nice hat, huh? I was wondering... You know, what happened the other night? Hey, Juliette, this is... It's good, okay? Yeah? -Yeah, it's really fine. Okay. -Okay. Okay, cool. Bye. -Ciao. Hey, Juliette! Sausage! Yes, cool! Sorry. People on the beach are beautiful . We can feel the frenzy beginning. So, right now, we can see people doing the "woo-hoo" over there. People are happy, eat hot dogs, put on weight, and we, we are talking about what's going on. It's not easy around here! It's already over. We're gonna miss ya'll. Thank you so much for coming in such great numbers. We were at least 14? 15? That doesn't include us. -Not to mention 20! Maybe we're exaggerating, maybe not. -Then we'll go on. Yes, we'll go on! Simard gave us a beautiful 270 in, switch up 270 out, pretzel on the rooftop. Let's congratulate him. Big move. Well done! And that's pretty exceptional, not to say it almost got girls wet in the stands. In fact, what it means is that it's an instant qualification for the Belcarra WakeFest. Canada's most successful wakeboarding competition. -Rock and roll, party animal! Anyway, I speak for everyone when I say... A big congrats for my handsome P-O. We're going to get our country, I'm proud to be, my friends! Look at the handsome Simard with his winning smile. But I don't think Simard would have had the same smile if Charlie Hall had entered the competition, because he would have won for sure. Speaking of him, we've got some amazing news to tell you, a news that comes like a good fuck after a week's abstinence. It's the return, and we're announcing it... Of our local fleur-de-lys, our prodigy. The one we love. Lock-up your daughters, ladies and gentlemen. Charlie Hall will be back on track. Make some noise for Charlie Hall! And Belcarra's offering him a seat on the jury, ...to regain some energy. By the way, I quote "as a support to the industry, we're happy to help the best of our riders get back in, little by little. Welcome back, Charlie. You've inspired a lot of riders to go above and beyond. We can't wait to see you hit the water again." I took the voice mail messages this morning! It's nice, hey? What? What's up, bro? Aren't you happy? Hi, Charlie. I got the results of your x-rays, your ligament injury appears to be healing normally. The good news is we won't have to consider surgery. I've discussed it with your coach, and in a few months... You'll be able to slowly go back to your sport, until full recovery. Call me back when you have a chance. Two aces. -Okay. Huh. I'll go with... Three kings -Wow! Bluff, bluff, bluff... -Good, good, good... There you go. -Oh yeah! There you go! -Thank you. I'd like to propose a toast to Simard's victory today! -Yeah! Toast to me, toast to me... And to Charlie Hall's big comeback! -Yeah! Way to go, Charlie. Thank you, thank you... Aren't you drinking, man? Huh. I don't wanna get too picky, but do you have any vodka soda or anything like that? The fuck vodka soda? -What? Forget the vodka soda bro. Drink your beers, we'll go for a run in the morning. Yeah, you're drinking that? It's just that it's less caloric. -Are you drinking this to keep your shape? Are you doing cunnilingus to old people to keep you in shape? -Holly shit... That's why Mrs. Castonguay loves you so much. Yep. -Okay. If that's what makes you good-looking, and attract grannies, I'll make you one. You're gonna make him a cunnilingus? Anyway... Congratulations. Really, you... You deserve your place on the jury. Are you stone? -No, I'm simply complimenting you. It's just... I think it's good timing. You'd have had a hard time... Getting back on this year. You're rusty... Like a rusty car, you need to go to the garage, otherwise you're not worth shit! And you, do you feel safe? Safe from what? Michael Schumacher, does it ring a bell? -Hmm-hmm. Yeah? He didn't hurt himself racing, he injured himself skiing off-track because he thought he was invincible. Now, he can't run no more and he shits in bags. Yeah, so? If you take everything for granted, I'm not giving you two years, you're done. Okay guys! Can we just drink-- -You can lecture me all you want, big. It's not because you weren't careful, that we're all gonna do the same. You've had your hour of glory, and didn't take advantage of it. That's your fault, big. That's it. Now you're out of the game, so... Raise scorecards. How many medals does it take you to shut the fuck up. Alright. I'm sorry. I know I went too far. Simard's in need of attention, he's gonna piss everybody off. Not everybody. I'm not going to piss you off. I'm going to make you come. Depressing... Stop. I'm gonna go guys. I'm tired. What? No! Hold on. Don't take it like that, big. Nice news like we got today, are not raining. Tomorrow the euphoria will be gone. We're going to go back to our shitty lives. My life is not that shitty. Shut the fuck up Simard! Yes, our shitty lives. 'Cause tomorrow we'll again face the climate crisis, and the government's instability. And tonight, I want us to forget that in a few years-- What are you getting at, Noah? Spread love. Let's love each other tonight. Let's be... Happy. I love you all. Okay? I love you all. Us too, it's just that... Okay. We can also start by playing Wii. Do you want one? No, thanks. I don't smoke. Hmm, sportsmen... So, what are you gonna do? What? About Belcarra. Guess it wasn't quite in your plans. I'm gonna have to go. That much? I don't know what I'd do without wakeboarding, I've got nothing else, so... Yep. You got us. -Yeah, but... I've had lots of that kind of friendships, and I don't see them anymore. I don't wanna offend anyone, you've been all really nice, but... Once I'll be gone, we'll never see each other again. Why not? You're drunk, you're telling shit, I don't think what we're living is fake. You say that now. I'm sure you've felt like that with other people once in your life. I'm going to ask you: Where are they now? Well... Well, that's it. What's that got to do with it? It was meant to happen eventually. Wakeboarding or not, I won't stay here forever. I mean... Every time we meet someone nice, it always ends up badly. There's no such thing as unconditional bonds. That's bullshit. Okay? Good night. Why are you saying that? What are you doing, Charlie? I'm freeing myself of my problems. Damn it, Charlie! I couldn't have been nicer to you. That's exactly the problem, Juliette. Stop being nice. When you're nice with people, they take advantage of you. That's... People are full of shit, Juliette. Stop being so nice to everyone. Do your things, don't count on anyone. You're just gonna be disappointed, anyway. Drinking doesn't suit you well. At least it makes me tell the truth, because truth is that... I don't belong here. You can't understand. You work in a marina, for fuck sake. What you're doing here ain't getting you nowhere You're wading on yourselves while you're waiting... A lifeline, but... There will be no rescue. Okay? There will be no rescue. It's gonna end up like Jack in the Titanic. Poof. You're right. I may be getting nowhere with what I'm doing here. But it's gonna get me a lot further than if I stay with you. Yeah. Shit! Where's Charlie? I got 'em! That means the other Bitcoins are gone. You know, I spend my days on the Internet. I learn everything on the internet. I'm like a sponge. I sit in front of my computer and I'm learning everything. Me, I don't listen to the news anymore. TV is for sheep. I get the information I need from YouTube. That's when I discovered, uh... The Bitcoin business. You... If you want, I can give you some links. There are stuffs, that are going to be too tricky for you. I'll send you into the more basic stuff. You could get rich. You could get rich quick. I've got 100,000. I've got 100,000 Bitcoins in there. As soon as my phone is charged, I'll show you. -100,000? Hey, I'll sell you one Bitcoin. You want one? It'll change your life. One Bitcoin. 100,000 bucks in two years. I guarantee it at 80%. A guy like you with money, you could have the life you want. I don't know what you wanna do in life. I don't know what your dreams are. I don't know if you wanna bring back... The Kibboutz... Do you know what a Kibboutz is? -Uh...-- You don't know, because nobody knows that but me. Since I'm a sponge. I watched two documentaries on Kibboutz yesterday. Two. I saw one, I said okay. I like it. The second one wasn't as good. But Kibboutz, was a community in Israel in the '60s. They went over there, They loved agriculture. You know, ladies with hairy underarms, They liked to... grow lusern, eat tofu, all that in community. And they were fucking. They're all fucking each other, these people. If you want, Bitcoin allows you to do that. And the Internet allows you to learn. I educated myself like that, on the Internet. I learn everything from the Internet. I spend 10 hours a day, 12 hours a day on YouTube. When I get too tired, I come to the movies. I relax a little. I don't go in to see the movie, I watch... Relax, and I'm going back home. I'm learning stuff. I've learned a thousand things. If you want, I could teach you stuff. Even you could... You should buy some Bitcoins. Do you want some? Check this out. I acted like shit with Juliette. Yep, I know. Don't be so surprised. We talk to each other in the group. We're not in the 16th century. It's healthy to express your emotions. Yeah, but I feel bad. Like... She can't understand. You think you're digging wells in Africa, or you're a peacekeepers in Afghanistan? I mean, you do wakeboard competitions where there are fewer people than at our primary flute concerts. Far from me the idea to diminish what you do, but it doesn't give you the right to be condescending. I know. I know I was stupid to react like this, it's just that... In not long, I'll return to my former life, like nothing ever happened. Whether I want it or not, I'm... I don't know. It sucks! Well, you could have just told her that. She's not stupid, you know, she would have understood. I just find it sad to think that she'll become the kind of friend I see once in a while. It doesn't have to be like that! It'll be it, if you convince yourself that it'll be like that. You don't live in China. Get your fucking license and go visit her. Live your life, get married, do whatever you want! But don't have children. It's just going to give birth to more tortured people. I understand why girls like you so much, you speak so well. I told you. No one is resisting me. They all sleep with me. Good plan to catch gonorrhoea... For me to refuse a girl sucks my dick... She would have to have four AIDS or look like my mother. Shut up! Four? Yeah, four! -I love you man, come here. Four is good for sharing-- -Shut the fuck up! Hey! First trip together! It's going to be sick. The waters of Belcarra are like... Our great mosque in Western Canada. But in a wakeboard version... It was a joke. What's the matter? -P-O I... Hey! I will come with you, but I won't come to your competition. Okay, well... That's okay by me. I want to stay there for a while. I need to... Take time for me, then... ...meet new people. All alone? I need this. Okay... Okay. Holly fucking shit!... It's gross. As long as it can ride. By the way, I'll pitch in for gas. -Hey, what did we say about that? Anyway, it's four dollars filling a scooter. I can pay us that. Luckily we still have a job. Or not. -Or not. You did that for me? At least now you will know what it is. I'm going to go fast, huh? Wow. For real, it's... I don't know, it's... It's sick, Juliette. It is... Thank you. You're welcome. I just don't know what to say, it's... It's sick. It's beautiful, huh? -I... I’m speechless Then, I'm happy. Okay. I'm not eager to go home. I always have the impression that after such a great summer... It’s as if everything we went through became an old memory. It's so weird. It's funny you say that. I always feel like it's only happening to me. -No... Really not. Maybe we're just too sensitive and get involved too quickly. It's fucked up... -Yeah, it's fucked up! I don't know. It bothers me to meet people fucking nice... Then overnight, these people disappear of my life, so... I always ask myself... Whether what happened with them was a dream or not. -Mmmh. Yeah. And... I don’t know... I don't want it to happen with us. Like... I want that... When I come back and we meet again, everything will be exactly like this summer, that nothing has changed. That we just... Pick up where we left off. -Yeah. Yeah? -I'm really down. Okay... Okay, so I think... We should take a picture of this moment with our eyes, to be sure to remember. Take a photo with our eyes..? -Yes. No? Yes, okay. -Yeah? Are you ready? Like... Right now? -Yes! I mean, it's the perfect time. The weather is nice... We're feeling great... That way, we're sure that when we meet again, it’s going to be like all this... was yesterday. Yeah! -Yeah? Yeah, okay! You ready? Yeah, I'm ready. -Okay.
