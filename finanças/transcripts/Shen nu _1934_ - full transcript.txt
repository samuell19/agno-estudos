Struggling in the whirlwind of life... Wandering the streets at night, she's a miserable woman... But when she holds her son in her arms, she becomes a loving mother. Her double life reveals her great character as a woman. The water bottle has been filled. Please take care of him when he wakes up. You know how you can thank me? Stay with me tonight. I'd never have thought she had a son. Oh, what nice dishes! Go buy some wine, quick! It's our boss' wedding feast. Drink up. Don't be coy about compliments from others. Why don't you ask around to see how powerful I am? What can a lonely woman like yourself possibly achieve out there on your own? From then on, she became the property of Boss Zhang I need money to recoup my losses! I can't go on living like this. I must move out and find another job. Please, don't tell him where I've gone. Relatives and good friends, job offers for those with references only. Your boy? Someone paid 200 dollars and took him away. This is just to teach you a lesson. If you still want that child... The Monkey King can never escape from Buddha's palm. She had no choice but to return to the boss. Day after day, the child grew and so did her concerns. I told you not to play with that wretched boy. Why do they always call me a "wretched boy"? Next time, don't play with them. People calling her son "wretched boy" hurts her. She thinks it is necessary for her son to get an education. And what is his father's occupation? His father is dead. The beginning of a new life brings her excitement. So, you've got money to send your son to school. I'm illiterate but I still live well. You don't have any say in my son's education. Today, the teacher taught us to do physical exercise, like this. I'll be your teacher. Stretch out your arms and stand up straight. One, two, one, two, one, two... I won't go out tonight. My mother told me not to play with him because he is a wretched boy. Bastard! Bastard! I lost all my money today again! One of these days I'm going to teach you a lesson. There's going to be a school gathering. My teacher asked me to sing a song. Today, we gather together in order to work closely with our parents. Sunrise, sunset, The exciting news from Sunset News, Evening News. He is so young, his voice so loud, Calling while the day is breaking, calling while the moon is rising. Shouting along the street, shouting around the corner. His voice is getting weaker along the street. His voice is getting hoarse around the corner. My parents are getting older and they are short on daily meals. Do you know what her job is? Parents have sent letters to the old principal To express their concern that the "wretched boy" may be harmful for the school. The old principal decided to find out the facts. You've studied hard. I'll buy you a new pair of shoes tomorrow. I have heard that there is something wrong with his mother's profession. If this is true, we'll have to expel him for the sake of our school's honour. What they said is true. I have to do this to have food. I live like this in shame. It's all for my son. He's my life. Even though I am a miserable woman, I'm his mother. Can't I try to let him learn something good? I sell myself in order to support him to go to school. I want him to be a good person. Why should he be unfit to go to school? I'm sorry. I was wrong. I can't dismiss a boy who has a mother like you. His mother is indeed a prostitute. But that is a social problem. We shouldn't undermine her dignity, and especially not the boy's dignity. In order to survive, she has to struggle through life's hardships, all for the future of this boy. She wants him to get an education. Since we are in charge of education, we shall rescue this boy from his harsh environment. Your opinion seems too sentimental. We must try to be objective. Right, we must consider the opinion of other students' parents. Otherwise, the future of our school may be in danger. You've forgotten the basic principles of education. We shouldn't harm a boy's chances of moving up because of common prejudices. I can't agree to this and still be part of this school. The old principal handed in his resignation. Meanwhile, the school board posted the boy's letter of expulsion. It is important to have a legal background for all of our students. It is clear to us that this student's background is indeed unsuitable. We shall expel this student to protect the school's honour. The teacher told me not to go to school tomorrow. So, they really did it. These people won't let us survive here. We'll move someplace else, where no one knows us. If you don't give me back my money, we'll all die. I've spent it all. What can you do to me? Then I'll fight you to death. Where is my child? Let me out. Sentence in the Gambling House Murder Case The murderer is sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment. You lied to me. What are you here for? They didn't allow me to do what I had promised you. Now, your child... My child? The court has sent him to a reform school. But I'll take care of him and educate him myself. With a mother like me, people will look down on my child forever. When he grows up, please tell him that his mother is dead so he won't know anything about me. In prison, she found peace for the first time in her life, along with hope for her son's bright future. The End
