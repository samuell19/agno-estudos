Where are you going? I'm just gonna, you know. Nicky, do you think I should lose weight? Uh sure. At least if you want. Nicky, is there anything you'd like to watch? Nah, I gotta go. No breakfast? What about coffee? Oh, kind of a mess. You wanna spend tonight together? Uh, we're delivering an episode tonight, so it's long hours. But, I'll catch you next time. Right, next time. Bye. Don't say it like that. That's so final. See you soon. We'll make it work. I don't know how you're gonna get these fools to coordinate that. Well, that's where we come in. I mean, whenever anything went down in Ape house, we'd have to be the guys organizing and nothing's changed. You gotta pick up a little more slack since you still live there. They're idiots. Having them stagger into a bar is one thing. But you're asking them to sit down like- - Robin, gimme a second. Hello? This is... Yes, it is. Um, no, I'm not on set. Uh, well, according to the shooting schedule, he's off from Wednesday to Friday. He's supposed to go in for ADR the following Monday. Give me another sec. Yeah. That Tuesday after lunch could work. How about 3:30? No, thank you. All right. I'm back. You gonna invite Helen? No, I'm going hiking with her the day before. So let's just keep this for the guys. Whatever you say. Listen, I'll send you a list of places later today. I gotta go. Alright. - Morning. - Hey, what's good, Peter? You packed? We'll go to the Getty when we get back. And I said you packed? Oh, uh... But I do want to go. They got some live performances, Beethoven's 16th string quartet. I don't see what's so special about some douche bag with the same degree as you performing in 80 degree weather and getting swamp ass. Says the guy putting this shit on. I mean, I turned down the sound and you didn't even notice. This is a classic. Right? You got young Frank Sinatra and Burt Lancaster, both in prime form. Oh, gay. They don't make movies like this anymore. Besides we'll go to the museum when we get back. We gotta plan for this Ape house reunion. I don't think I can go. What, what do you mean? I'm going skiing in Vermont the day after we land. So... How you gonna miss the whole gang getting together? I mean, even Zach's going and he's ancient, bro. You seeing Helen? We're going hiking in Tallman or Bear Mountain. Uh, see if she wants to take my place. You know, she's been talking about coming out here for, I don't know how long. Uh uh it's a boy's night. Yo, you got any of those like little liquid bottles? Uh yeah. They're in the bathroom. Thanks. Now. Where were we? Did you recognize me from the back of my head? Well, not yet. - Your show. - Hmm. Right? So basically these aliens, they come to Earth, colonize it and then people either form a resistance or assimilate to that lifestyle. Inner fighting ensues. Ah, cool. Yeah. It's a neat premise. And which one would you be? Which one? Which side would you be on? Hmm. That's a good question. I might be a rebel. Oh. So you're difficult. Well, I mean, you wouldn't have to wait for the aliens to find that out. - Really? - Yep. Nicky! Hey you. Oh, sorry about that. How you doing man? Thanks for coming. Oh man. Hey, did you get the link I sent? Did you enjoy it? - I did. - But did you enjoy it? - I loved it. - Good. 'Cause you know Leah's in it. Yeah. Yeah, I saw it, it was, it was a great short film. - I appreciate that. - It was great. You know Nicky's originally from New York. - I know. - Yeah man, I'm actually getting to know Leah right now. - Great. - Yeah. Hey, Nicky, I will be right back, but you're still gonna be here, right? - Of course, of course. - Okay. Great. Goodbye Leah. Bro, tell you, I got this girl coming tonight. She's this Midwest girl coming with some friends. My name's Evelyn. She's got this perfect ass. Perfect face. I mean, mm mm. It's great, man. You're trying to like wife her up or? Ugh. God, if only right? Us guys, you know? Well look around. Okay. You looking? Yep. There could be a girl in here tonight that could be having your baby. Oh, oo. That's crazy. Hey, you're still working on that show? Yeah. 'Til... 'til March. Oh that's great, man. Does it put you on set a lot? Now I'm in post production. Right. Hey, well listen. I'm gonna do a few rounds. You think you gonna be around? - Be right here. - Cool. I'm gonna grab a towel. I'll see you around. Thanks for coming bro. No problem. You, you bro. Alright, see you. No, you. And then she decides she doesn't wanna hang out with me anymore. You here for Matt? We are. We? I came here with some friends. Ah. I did not know that he could run a place like this. He didn't. He told people to show up and now the bartender's ripping his hair out. Oh yeah? Where are you from? - That obvious? - Mm hmm. Coon Rapids, Minnesota. Mm. So a one road town with a coffee shop and taxidermy. - And a pizzeria. - Ugh, terrible. Oo, a New York boy. Is it that obvious? New York isn't the only place with good pizza. Plenty of great places in the Midwest. Yeah. That's like saying Salieri is as good as Mozart. So how long before you head home for the holidays? Let's text. We could do that. Uh, you wanted to see me? Hey, let's, let's go over the ADR schedule for when we get back. You sure that there's a... Yeah. But before we get into that. Oh thank you. I'm not gonna lie. I'm happy to get a break. So what's Ape house? I've heard that a couple times from your desk. Oh that's that's the house nickname where me and my friends lived in college. Yeah. We threw some wild parties and that's the name we got. That's great. Yeah. I'm gonna be seeing a lot of them. Derek and I are the only ones that don't live at home. Derek lives in Texas now, but he'll be back too. We still got it. You know. I'm sure you got a lot of plans. You know it. Ah, that's my, my New York girls. What could I say? Grass is always greener. Are you heading home? Life's here now. 30 years now. We usually go up to Monterey. But this time the in-laws are coming down. Is that good or? Well Cheryl's mom is getting pretty sick. So this is probably the last time she's gonna be able to travel. Can you believe she's never hiked the Hollywood sign. Oh, well, sorry to hear that you won't be going up. It's okay. I'm glad she's saying goodbye in her own way. The only downside is she's bringing the cats. Ugh. Cats. I'm allergic. Mm, me too. I mean, why anyone would leave the bay area for this is beyond me, it's much prettier up there anyway. Remember grass is always greener. Psst. Dom. Dom. - What? - Get up. What for? We're switching seats. Nuh uh. Are you? Switch seats with me. What's your problem, man? Red. Come on. Come on, come on, get up, get up. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Can't keep it in your pants for one second. Thank you. Trying to fill that void in your little shitty soul. Um, wasn't someone else just sitting here? Um, no, no. It's, it's only ever been me. So all I'm saying is it was rude. Oh, come on. Think you're really gonna mad. It's how you said it, bro. Words have meaning. Okay? So just be careful. Listen, have fun in Vermont. Just break a leg. You know? I'm going skiing. Exactly. See ya. I will have fun. God. Hey Paul. Nicky. Good to see ya. Come on in. Nicky! - Hey Mom. - Ah. Hey Nicky. Hey, TJ. Put your stuff down and come back out. Okay. Lunch is gonna be ready soon. Paul, I'm sorry I didn't make it back in time for Pops. Your life's out there now. Are you seeing anyone? No one to write home about. You see any celebrities? DJ! - Yeah. Sometimes. - Pretty sick. Huh? TJ, that homework better be done before lunch is ready. I'm doing it. And um, you still on your show? Mm hmm. Yeah, show's actually pretty cool. It's about aliens coming down to Earth. They colonize it and then people gotta decide whether they wanna fight back or, or join them. I'm just gonna go finish this in my room, okay? No, no, no. Have a seat. It's gonna be ready in a minute. I mean, I don't see why I have to be out here. So you haven't seen your brother the whole year and now you're gonna abandon him? - Alright. - It's fine. Paul, how was the service? It was fine. I'm only asking because- - No, your cousin, Megan brought that really nice boyfriend of hers. You'd love him. They're gonna make fine parents one day. Who knows, if you come to the New Year's celebration, maybe she could introduce you to some of her friends and... I'm all good, Mom. Thank you. He shouldn't be lurching around his cousin's friends. Yeah. My step cousins. We're so happy to have you home. So happy, sweetie. Whoo! It's good to see you Becky. Oh shit. In the past I'm so used to- - I'm still on the pill. Oh, okay, good. It's a shame you're only here once a year. Yeah, but it'd be a lot harder to get around... your boyfriend. - Tim? - Tim. That's it. - He knows. - He what? He knows what I do with you. Uh... I always like to let him know what I'm doing. Sometimes I tell him immediately after we're done. It helps him climax. You see? Yeah- - I'm mean why do you think I let you finish? Please stop. Nicky. Hey. Oh, so good to see you. Let's sit. Okay. Tell me everything about LA. Well, to start, nobody knows how to drive out there. I mean they have all the attitude of New York drivers, but none of the skill. I'm happy you're alive. Yeah. For now. So you and Sam are? We broke up, but- - Right. Good for you. What about the girls, you know, you still keep in touch with everyone and? I do. Emily still talks over everything anyone else says. And when I do speak Katrin and Nicole look at me like I have three heads. They're jealous. I mean, they're in the rat race out here and you're working at one of the biggest record labels in the country, so... PR, I'm in PR. So... Yeah, but it's much cooler PR than fucking health insurance or for one of those crooks on Wall Street. True. It is nice to work with people who actually vibe to the same music I do and share a cubicle with fellow Dead Heads. So what brings you back here, Nicky? I mean, what am I gonna spend Christmas on the beach? It's only like my second holiday season away and it's not like I have foster parents out there. You know? You got a new place now, right? I love it. Congrats. Congrats. You like all moved in and? Getting there. Nice. I'd love to see it sometime. We can go there after this. Here we are. Oh, nice. I like the space. Thank you. Neighbors haven't been loud, which is a huge plus. Uh huh. Okay. Right this way. Wow. Yeah. New plant. Those drapes from home. Nice, nice. And that lamp from junior year of college. You made it very homey. I tried. Bless you. This is nice. Mm. I don't remember the last time I had an orgasm. Oh. Sorry to hear that. But you haven't cum once. Yeah, it doesn't always happen. You know? Really? Yeah. Maybe it's like desensitized. I don't know. Don't worry. Don't worry. Okay. Just cause it didn't happen this time doesn't mean that it won't happen next time. You know? You wanna see me again? Yeah, of course. Okay. And he brings us our drinks and my mom asks if he's single. Yo guys keep up. Who are these guys? Friends from high school. This is what happens when you never leave your hometown. You were saying? Right? So he's watching, I'm embarrassed. And my mom tells him to give me his number. Oh my god. She's just living in fear that I'm not married and I'm alone in a studio apartment, which she always takes the time out to criticize to my face. But no matter what I do, still never enough. She should see my place then, I mean I do have a couple posters though. - Are they framed? - Framed? No. That's the difference between class and sad. Oh yeah. What's the cut off? 22. Ah, man, just missed it. Oo, that's pretty. Oh yeah, look at the trees. Yeah, no, you don't get this in LA. I mean, here you get this. Then drive down the Palisades and you're greeted by concrete heavens. Shut up. Trust me, you'll see when you visit. We have like six skyscrapers. So you do wanna hang out again? Yeah. What do you mean? I didn't get an invite to the gang's dinner. Well that's a guy's thing. You are going to Pager's new year's party, right? Yeah. So what, this, the dinner, the new year's thing and nothing else? Oh, there's something else. Who? Not gonna believe it. Lily. You're kidding me? This is such a bad idea. This woman wrecked you. I just want a nice moment. Okay? What's a nice moment coming from a guy- - Just something nice with someone who gets it, who gets me. So there's not a single woman in your life that stands out, not one? I mean I'm not a gorilla or some fucking animal that's just looking to... you know sometimes it would just be nice to have someone to come home to, someone who cares. Right? Yeah. So just crave affection from the woman who just kept you at arm's length. Let's just, let's just enjoy the view. Okay? Do you have a reservation with us? Yeah. For Leandro? Leandro. Right, follow me. Mr. Fiorenza, the rest of that party is here. You guys are late. Your friends are late too. Okay. So? - Spoiled brats. - Unbelievable. Yo, check this out. Huh? Okay. Okay. Oh my god. Damn. Right? Her name's Tanya. She's fucking dynamite. Yeah. And she's a, she's an older bird. Yeah, she came from Athens, Georgia, like 20 years ago trying to act, now she's in post. Yeah and now she's working with you. Yes she is. This guy showed up. Mr. Hollywood here. - Have a seat. - Hello fellas. Alright. Alright guys, guys, guys, guys. Look what I got. Boom! You still have that? Look at this fucking shirt. - I miss those days. - Sir. Yeah, man. We ran shit. No one came close. I'll cheers to that. It will take all my fingers and toes to count how many times the cops got called on us in that house. Fuck 'em, fuck 'em. Okay, okay. Listen. So who are we taking down this break? I mean, we got our list. The list! It's filled. So let's hear it. I mean some you know, some you don't. He's a cryptic guy, cryptic. I mean, what's the point of me telling your girls I went to high school with? No, no, no, fuck that. Tell us about the college girls. Yeah. - You know, actually- - You know what? Do you know who I saw in the queue? - Who? - Lily. Oh, Lily. What was she doing? I don't know. I think she lived somewhere there. I think 70 something. Fuck, she used to be bad. So bad. She was a good pipe. Yeah man. Forget it. She ran through my whole house at 481. Matter of fact, didn't she smash Derek on a balcony? Yes, yes, yes. Please tell me that one of you guys still have that video. Those two were banging for a while. Until he got tired. It doesn't take that long to tie Derek out. Party for Leandro. 7:30. The reservation was 7:30. Nicky over there had her too. Oh yeah. I mean I had that before any of you. Yeah. Maybe at this table. Not in our dorm suite. Howdy there, partner. I missed you guys. How was Houston? It is pretty good. I, I'm still at the firm and I should get a house outside the city in a year or so. Nicky, you think you could get a house with that Hollywood money? What? I'm a post coordinator. They practically give houses away in Texas. - So no. - Right. And I got this. - What's that? - It's my CC. Right. Smart man. When did you get this? Well, it says it right there. You got a gun? When we talking gun, are we talking assault? Little shotgun? Maybe a pistol there cowboy, huh? It's a Glock 17. Huh? Standard. What? Fuck. Really? I mean what would you ever need that for? Lots of reasons. So when you say AR, are we talking like- - Name one. For now? Fun. I'll drink to that. Just in case. You see what goes on out there in the world these days. Yeah man. Lots of weirdos. What? I'm just saying. It's pretty sketch. Well it's nice to know that you don't care about mass shootings. That's a ridiculous statement, but I mean, there's not even a place for- - How much do you wanna bet the next one's gonna be in the north? I'll take that bet. Hey Tommy, gimme an over under on the west coast. Guys. Quit. Hey. Guy! Hey, chill, chill. Seriously? Happy what you did, ruin a nice thing? You know, I think you'll think about it differently when you have a family. You don't have a, bro, you were too scared to shoot fireworks on the 4th of July. It's different. You were gonna blow your finger up. Come on, all you's, out. Next party's here. We made a reservation. Which half of you fucks were late for you. You, I want you outta here. This bump out. Hey douche bag, you, get the fuck out. Come on. Come on, let's come on, get the fuck- Get outta here! It sad. It's truly sad. I mean the fuck has been in Houston a year and he's got the balls to be spewing the second amendment bullshit. I am sorry that ruined dinner. Fucking different down there, man. I mean I know John Reed, but the type of backwards privatization that those state's spew. Nicky please, no one knows what the fuck you're talking about. I'm saying he's living in an urban center. Okay? He's not living in the fucking ticks. I have some hope he is getting acclimated. Hope? I haven't had hope since Super Tuesday, 2020. Every year you come home to pomp and applause and a, and a hero's welcome. And this year you gotta share it. Finance. South of the Mason Dixon line. Has anyone seen my shirt? Oh, that's not cool, man. It's not fucking cool. Dude. Chill out. This is Derek. This is the guy who used to match you in wizard staff. And he used to get the shitty jelly sauce for his mozz sticks. Look, I'm not saying I'm cool either, alright? I used to be so fucking cool. Now I'm a working stiff. Look. I, I hear you bro. Look, you got something to say to him, he's coming up on the elevator right now. Why is he coming here? I asked him to come over for breakfast stuff. Jesus Christ. Why. You guys are best friends. You'll work it out. Hey. - Hey. - What's up man? No boots today? Those were dope, man. Yeah, man. Saving for the party. Ah, that's smart. So what's going on? What are we waiting on? Yeah, we'll head out once Robin's done. Okay. I heard I miss some of your dogging in LA. Yeah. You missed some like pictures I was showing earlier. Was there a cougar in there? A couple. There's this other girl too. She's like this Southern bell type. - Yeah. - Poor creature. Fuck man. Some things never change. Right. I mean if the right girl came along. Right, right, right. Right, right. Totally, yeah. I mean, it just hasn't happened yet. Right. Just hasn't happened yet. - Yeah. - I can't believe I lost that shirt. Oh, I could help you look for it. Nah, nah. It's all right. I think it's like a metaphor, you know? Like that, that part of my life is over. It is a new chapter. Yeah. Wow. Oh boy. We are outty five-thoutty. That fucking shirt. Here you go. - Hi. - Hi. How's it going? Oh fine. - Yeah? - Yeah. Do you have any plans for today? I'm actually gonna head back into the city. Oh. Okay. Yeah. Why was there something that you- - Oh no, no. It's okay. I should be home tonight though. Yeah. Of course. Here. No Ma. Here. Oh, no Ma, really? It's not much. Please take it. Hey, you be good now. What's wrong? Nothing. Thinking about something? Everything and nothing. You used to be able to tell me anything. Yeah. Look where that got me. Why don't we get outta here? What did you have in mind? Some sights. - Sights? - Yeah. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Let's go. Here it is. Nicky, I love ice skating. I mean all you had to say was you wanted to take me. What? No, I don't even know how to skate. We're here for the tree. Could we get going? Uh, are you hungry? Yeah. Sure. Okay. Why the hell are we by the water? It's fucking freezing. Whoa, whoa. Where's the bench? There's a bench over there. Yeah but this is the bench from the movie. For what? Well I thought it'd be nice to, you know, sit here. Watch the sun come up. That doesn't sound like... Would've been nice. Look, look it's cold. So why don't we... Oh. Wow. Did you finish? Uh uh. Is there anything I can do? No, no, no. I'm okay. Just need a little time out. There's gotta be something. Nah I'm, I'm really, I'm good. I just, you know, takes me a while. But it's the second time. It's, it's just how my body works. Okay. You have like a, like a towel, I could dry off with? Top rack. Thank you. Sorry. This is a nice jacket. Who's is this? It's Sammy's. Sammy's, wow. You two not cool anymore? Nice though, wouldn't want his stuff lingering around me. He's not the first person I think about hitting up. Yeah. Well what does it matter what you say about the people? Orson Wells? "Touch of Evil"! No? Okay. What about the cat? What about it? That was a gift from him. Can't have joint custody over it. So uh, I mean, I've been thinking and I mean there's something here, right? I, well, I, I really see a future with you. You know, like us together. I don't know. I'll tell you what, you know that party at Paige's next week? Mm hmm. Well, why don't you come with me? Why do you want that? I don't know. It'll be fun. Maybe. Come on, how many chances are we gonna have to go out all fancy together? I have feelings for you. It's just that if you were going to stay here and you wanted to continue this, I would leave him for you. Nicky Leandro. Never thought I'd have to see you again. Stephanie. Nice to see you. Taking a break from being a non-committal philandering prick out west and thought you'd drop by? Uh huh. I'm so sorry he brought you to this, honey. You can do a lot better than this fuck boy. Stephanie, meet the reason I'm a non-committal philandering fuck boy. Lily, this is Stephanie. Charmed. Yeah. Well the wine's a hit. - Oh, there he is. - Dude. - What's up? - How you doing? Good. Hey. You still listen to weird shit? Um, yeah. - You know Derek's- - Yeah, I'm gonna say hi. I'll be right back. - Hey buddy. - What's up? Oh, it's good to see you. You too. You too. Oh my god. I am so sorry about the other night. Bro, don't even mention that. Oh my god. No, no, look, I gotta tell you something. What's up? This, this, this whole moving thing. I, I, I, I don't know if I can do it. What's that now? Yeah. Houston. I, I, I don't think I can make it there. Like being this far away from a home, it's getting to me. No, no, no, no, no, no, listen. You're on an adventure being out there. You're spreading your wings man. You're, you're flying. Okay? Yeah. I'm thinking about moving back. How can you do that? You got such a good job. You know you got, you got all these things going. Yeah, but I can do that here. No, no, no you can't man. 'Cause you gotta, you know, you gotta, I mean, where's, where's your grit, you know, you're growing hair on your chest being out there. I need to speak with you. Uh, just one second. So I don't- - Come on. What are you doing with her? Get off of me. Yeah and you're gonna cry on my shoulder later. You brought the girl who ripped your heart out to this. Keep your voice down. No one knows, but I'm telling you you're gonna die alone in a barren home with no art on the walls 'cause you're a shitty interior designer. I don't need this. Hey girl. Uh hey guys. Long time no see. Hey you're looking nice. Thanks. Something he'd like for sure. Oh. Hey, you could be doing a lot worse. So could he. See you around. You've got a man among men. Hi Helen. Couldn't get enough, could you? They fuck their cousins down there. You turning into a cousin fucker? That's the Midwest. Same fucking difference. Okay look, they're the country's biggest producer in oil, cattle, sheep, minerals, you know? Yeah but why not Louisiana or Tennessee? Tennessee? What the fuck are you talking about, Tennessee? What do you mean? They got Nashville down there. It's a sick town. - Nashville? - Yeah. Next to a state that has Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, Houston. Man. You don't know who you're talking about. I don't know what I'm talking about? That's such a downgrade, alright? That's like saying Roger Moore is a better 007 than Sean Connery. I mean it's ridiculous. What, you mean Daniel Craig is a better Bond than Pierce Brosnan? Dan Craig. Are you fuck? I can't. I can't. Whatever man, you're a fucking ass. Stupid, man. Fuck. He hasn't bothered you in who knows how long. He didn't have to see me again. And he hit you up all the way from LA? I don't know what you're so bothered about. I know more than these other assholes. Hey guys, what's up? The hangs back in town. Huh? Yeah, most of us anyway. Yeah, but don't worry about the guys who run here are herbs, man. You guys, happy you're back. It is good to be back. Nicky, how's it being back your mom and dad's. He's got his own problems, but he sure as shit didn't play with you. Are you fucking kidding me? You know what kind of a jackass I'd have to be to take it seriously with a guy like him? At first. Yes. But for three years after he didn't show you enough? Everyone knows what he is. Fucking Robby Bones is gonna be a doctor. Nick how's acting going? I'm not an actor. You know, I thought about, I should probably act too. What do you think? Yeah. You know, I thought about trying out brain surgery, you know, I think I have a knack for it. I might take it up still. Look, if I had known all of his friends were gonna gimme grief, I would've stayed home. But you didn't. You're here with him. We're just trying to have a good time. You know what he thinks this means? And I'm gonna tell you something. When you moved on from him, it was pretty fucked up complaining about all the other men in your life to him. He didn't have to respond. You fucking used him. He would've done anything for you. And maybe instead of being thrown around by a bunch of douche bags, you could have had something nice. I was the one he asked for help in dealing with you. I had to hear about how you threw that Derek shit to him. If you don't leave, I will fucking kick your ass. Nicky, come here. Come here. Listen, will you tell this beautiful girl over here that she doesn't have to move to Los Angeles to be an actress? I mean, come on you live five minutes away from Broadway. You know, this reminds me of an old joke. Group of actors from New York, head to the promised land of LA to make it in the movies. At the same time, a group of actors in LA head to New York, 'cause they know that's the place to make it. When they're passing each other in Chicago, they both yell out of their cars. "Yo, you're going the wrong way." Hey, what's up? I'm sorry about that. I had to, you know... I have to go. Go, go where? You have my jacket? Uh, hold on. Whatever, whatever. You guys. Guys, guys, guys. The ball's about to drop. Ball's about to drop. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Happy new year! Hey, so you live in LA? So I'm looking to move out there. Do you have any pointers? Actually, there's a lot of things you need to know before you go out there. Why don't we sit down? I'll tell you. Happy new year. You know what time is? Jesus fucking Christ. I'm not in high school. Hey, you're in our house. Act like a proper guest. I've always been a guest in this house. You don't have to stay here. Tell her that. You're just not gonna say anything to him, right? What else is new? You're still a child. Yeah, you're still a grump. You know, this is the longest conversation we had in years. And what are you silently giving me shit for missing your dad's funeral? I had to work. What, was I gonna take four flights in three weeks? I want nothing from you. Nicky. No time lost here. Everybody's got their life to live. That's just fine. The day they moved Pops to hospice was the day of my final exams. Instead of leaving, I stayed. He died before the test time was over. Fine. I gotta live with that. You wanna be away from your brother and mother? That's fine too. You do you. I know this family's no stranger to loss. I get that. Trust me. For over a year my father battled that cancer every day. So what's so different about the two of us? And why the fuck are you the one with the attitude? How many years did you get with your father, Paul? Huh? How many years did I get with mine? How many chances have you had to not be a condescending? Whoa, whoa! What is going on with you two? Screw this. Hey sweetie. Hey. I'm almost done here. I'm gonna head out in a couple hours. Okay. Well I hope this was a good trip. Yeah, it was great. Because you know, we hadn't talked about it. So... What? That look you just did. Your dad used to do that. We used to dance to some of these records here. And he gave me that look. What happened to these? Water damage. Is that a dancing album? Oh, you can dance to anything if you've got your own rhythm. You know, love isn't just all hearts and chocolates. Sometimes it's leaving a note for someone or a kiss on the forehead. It's been great having you home. Goodbye. Now, don't say it like that. I'm gonna call you when I get home. Do you remember? That was good. Do you remember? Huh? Oh yeah. And Mike forgot to bring the drinks. No, you know, I gotta say, man, I didn't see much of you this time. You know? He's right. Not enough time with the home squad. I don't know, guys, times are changing, you know? Not if I can help it. To that. Yeah. You know, that's just the thing. Now you, you try to hold onto something and then it's just gone, gone. And the next day we're getting the queen in to do her lines. What's wrong? Oh, I'm good. Uh yeah, she's in for the rest of the week. No problem. Break go alright? Yeah, of course. I know it's hard being away from loved ones, parents especially. I was. Why did you already have the review? I told you 3:00. Oh I, well, Alan did- - Next time I tell you - 3:00, make sure it's 3:00. Now I have no idea what happened in there. Oof, little more backbone Tommy. Morning. Ah, oh fuck. Oo. Here. Let me just. Just, just gimme a minute. Okay. Here. Eh, slowly, slowly, slowly. - It's Evelyn. - Right. Mm hmm. - I knew that. - Mm hmm. Where am I? My college. College? You're in college? Yeah. We're in Claremont. Oh fuck me. Why? Well, it wasn't my first choice. But considering that my number one was- - Uh nope, not what I meant at all. Oh god. I slept here? So you don't remember driving here in the middle of the night? - I drove? - Yeah. You stood outside my window shouting my name. Well after the first few failed attempts. Oh fuck me. I thought it was sweet. Kind of like that play with that dead guy. Coffee. Coffee, please. We're almost there now. It's a nice place you got here. I think so. Creative drawings and whatnot. This one with the rose in the hand in the center. Yep. It used to be a gun shooting out flowers, but a year ago, student council sent a letter to the board saying it was emotionally triggering to African Americans. This is why we need bullies. - Nope. - Yep. - Definitely not. - Non debatable. You're wrong, so. Cold enough? Yeah. What's wrong? Nothing. Doesn't seem like nothing, Hey girl, who's this? This is Nicky. Well hello Nicky. Hi. You're lucky to be with her. Yep. Sure am. Odd, the accent is cute. I don't have an accent. The rest of the family sounds like that too? What? No, I, we speak normal. I think my stepfather sounds like a cougine and my mother straight off the boat. Just a century late. What's got you down, hun? What is this? An inquisition? Girl trouble. Yeah. Oo, girl trouble. What'd she do to you? You can tell us. It's a, I mean, you know when you like someone and- - And you're getting blown off. Yep. Well, tell her how you feel. Uh, there's a give and take, you know. You gotta do like this, this delicate dance. I don't wanna come out guns blazing and just make something out of nothing. What is there besides something out of nothing? Wait, but not over text. You should do something for Valentine's day. You wanna help me out with your friends here or? Well. Nevermind. You got other things on your mind. I'm making something outta nothing. You can put whatever you wanna see in it. Right? Well just gonna. Uh, ladies. I'll see you soon. Yeah. How's it going, Tommy? Pretty good. Well take a load off. You've been running around all day. I will. When the review's over. Yeah. That's, that's an interesting tattoo you got going on there. Oh yeah. I've had it for a while now. It's for my girlfriend. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. We first met at a tarot card reading. She had problems growing up, depression and those things. She was down in Florida to see her parents again, it, it went bad and she called me from her hotel room manic. I tried calming her down saying anything and everything I could to make her feel better. I was on the phone with her for over two hours, long enough until I, I felt like she was gonna be okay. Well you did the right thing. Her dad called me the next day telling me that she jumped from the window of her hotel room. Oh my god. Tommy, man. I'm so sorry. I got this to mark the first year anniversary. It's been four years now. Wow. Four years? I wouldn't trade the six months we were together for the world. Six... Oh. Uh huh. Hey! Look at you. One of us had to dress up for the occasion. It's just, I was swamped at work and. Oh, forget it. It's fine. - You sure? - Yeah. Hold on a sec. Really? What? Do you, you really want me to go get a glass? Who are we trying to impress? Okay. But what about the rest of it? Oh that, I'm really not all that hungry. What do you mean you're not that hungry. I ate at work. Why would you eat before this? I. This isn't doing it for you? You're right. It doesn't matter so long as we're here talking to each other right now. You know I really wish we could have done something like this in person. Yeah. Well maybe we can when you visit. Did you hear me? Yeah. Yeah. You want me to come visit. I know. And I do. It's just... Is it a money thing? 'Cause I'll just- - No, it's not. Work is really busy right now, you know? Well, I could come back. I don't even know when I'll be able to. All I'm asking for is a weekend. I know, but it's different. Maybe next time. Jesus Christ, Nicky. What? You! I knew this wasn't a good idea. - Yeah? - Yeah. All of it. You and me, it's too much. Too much? Yes. You come back East and expect everyone to drop everything for you. You expect more than what I can give you. Do you really need that much attention? You need to turn a vacation into a fucking conquest? And for what? You want me to relocate to California, lock me down, make us a thing? What's next, huh? Get married? Does that about sum it up? No. So let's just be done with it and call it for what it is, a fling. Fuck! Come on in. Nicky, do you think that with you coming over tonight, um, does that make us... Where do you see us going? Alysse, I, I don't see us like that. I'm sorry, I didn't know that... I should have never left home. I was really hoping with you. I really wanted to come home to someone every night. Alysse, Alysse, I promise you, you can get that. And I'm sorry that's not me. You're such an asshole. Look at you. Doing all right, babe? Sure. You know, I never did get that Christmas present. Let Tanya give you what you need. Call from Nick- - Hello? Hey Paul. How's it going? Pretty good. Um, is Mom home? No, she's out. What's up? Nothing. You know, just getting back in routine. Uh oh. Trying, you know. Actually I'm, I'm struggling over here. What's going on? There's this girl. I, I can't get her outta my head. Where'd you meet her? She's actually in New York. She's over here? What are you doing getting involved with someone over here? Sometimes the heart wants what it wants. Look, people are messy and affection could be hard, but in the end it's gotta make some kind of sense on some level. Yeah, that sounds nice. You'll get over it. You got plenty of time. Well, I don't feel it. Wait 'til you're my age. And you start looking at family photos where you look like an older version of your grandfather. You mean younger? - No. - Oh. Listen. When I was young, I got this job. I was like 16 at the movie theater. Yeah. That one in Suffern. Right. I started going out with the girl at the box office and we were going out for a couple of months and all of a sudden, the owner decides he's gonna hire this assistant manager. This guy comes in. He's like 19. All of a sudden he starts paying a lot of attention to my girlfriend. - Uh oh. - And my girlfriend starts paying a lot attention to him. Oof. I'm like 16. So I say, what the fuck? I don't know what's going on. So, I break up with her and she winds up going out with him. Well, you used your head. Plus, who knows if that girl and that manager even worked out. I'd say it worked out. Those were your parents. I didn't know things were gonna play out the way they did, but if those choices hadn't been made. You wouldn't be around. Wow. Don't get so hung up on this. You could be stopping her from something that works for them or worse. You could be stopping you. Yeah. That's, that's actually sounded advice, Paul. Good. Alright, you're clear with that then? My show's about to start. Yeah, you got it. Be good. Alright. Take care. That some heavy stuff for the holidays. I don't mean it to be. It's who you are. Yeah. I'm heavy? The heaviest, but it's okay. I like you, Your friends see all the extra work you put in, but don't think for one second, that all that extra work, isn't for you too. Extra work, so like me driving all the way out here when I live on the other side of town, does that count? Of course. You never know what's right under your nose. You know I've never been here? We'll get you out more. What is so funny? Uh you. Yeah? Funny all of a sudden. No, it's just the way you talk, like balancing your work, fun, friends, your girls. Yeah. A real laugh riot. You don't see me making fun of your life. Mm. You never ask me about my work. Your school work? My art work. Oh, oh, well, I can actually see that overlapping with, with what you study. - Mm. - Mm. Mm. Mm hmm. - Let's see. - Alright. Oh wow. I thought you'd like. You got skills. Well, the composition is great. I took this after... I, I... David and I were together for four years. We knew each other most of our lives. It was uh, it was a bad breakup? Uh, it happened after last semester. I don't know how or why, but this photo, this whole shoot made me think of David. And then I took this and I felt better. It's really bad when you expect a future with someone. I mean, don't you get mad? I was, but I'm better now than I was when I took this. He was a huge part of my growing up. And then they're no longer there. And that's okay. You have to heal in your own way. Hey, it got me to meet you. That's true. This house feels like it's falling apart. The bathroom door is broken. Hey, how's it going? I never get any privacy. Oh, I'm good. How are you? I'm good. I'm in a bit of a rush, but good. Yeah. That looks good. Yeah. It's pretty good so far. Well, watch it together when I get back. Yeah, sure. What are you guys doing? Chillin' like a villain. How 'bout a thing of popping each other's assholes. You help me figure out how we're gonna pay the rent next month. Hey man. You doing alright? You seem kind of... Yeah. Perfectly fine. Just got a plane to catch is all. Plane? Yeah. Okay. You're freaking me out, man. Relax. I will. As soon as I get back. Hey Alysse. I got your message. And there's something that we really need to talk about. Listen, I'm really sorry, but I actually won't be able to take you to the museum. He's got a plane. What am I supposed to do? You know, as it turns out, Alysse was actually an art history major. So maybe she'd make a great tour guide. I gotta go. I'm sorry. Uh. Wow. Yeah. Uh yeah. Special delivery. Nicky? Did you miss me? What are you doing here? Well, I wasn't getting you out West anytime soon and I really wanted to see you. Do you know how crazy this is? I'm getting used to it, but I really came to give you a dance lesson. But there's no music. Let's pretend. Oh wow. I gotta go. - Where? - Back home. You came here just for this? Yes I did. So the airport? Yeah, I got it covered. I had a lovely night. I couldn't ask for anything more. I'll let you know when I land. Yes. Let's see what happens in a month. And there's always this summer. Goodbye.
