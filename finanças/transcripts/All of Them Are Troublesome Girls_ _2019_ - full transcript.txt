Shiraha High School Entrance Ceremony Alright. Mr. Kunitachi. Yes. As a new teacher, looking after freshmen might be a hard task. Please do your best. Thank you. I will. What's wrong? Um... Come on. OK, quiet now. All of Them Are Troublesome Girls! The following day We're choosing class officers today. Yes. Great. A lab coat?! First of all, for class president. Any volunteers? Yes. Class President Eiko Enomoto Any other candidates? I guess that decides that. Hey, no games in school. I'll hang on to this. Yo, teach. Will class pres get me a good recommendation? If so, I want to do it. You're worrying about that already? How desperate are you? Maybe so. But what you just said cancels it out. Oh, man! However, I'm sure Enomoto volunteered out of pure motivation, right? Yes. Good. Alright, the next position... Thanks for volunteering to do class president. It's nothing. Mr. Kudo. Would you like to join me for lunch? Did you make that yourself? I bet you're good at anything. Not really... Found it. You... It's Kazumiya. Ah, Kazumiya... This is the teacher's office. That's my desk. And that's the game I took away. Why are you playing again? I came to get it back and found it here so I started playing. I appreciate your honesty... Hey! I was going to scold you but... Don't bring it to school. Okay. Hey. Did you hear what I just said? It'll be my last day to play at school. I'm keeping this. Go play with your friends. Without games. Mr. Kunitachi. I don't have friends. What? So please be my friend until I make my own friends. Huh? Where are you going? The cafeteria. I see. You're coming too? Well... I won't go if it bothers you. I can play word chain by myself. All by myself. What are you having? What? Uh... - I already had jelly. - - Dummy. You're a growing teenager. You need proper nutrition from real food. Geez. Let's eat. You are... Hm? You are like... a grandmother. I can understand father... but grandmother? Yes. That's a compliment. Thank you for lunch. Here. Leave it at home. - Okay. - - Good. See you tomorrow then. Can I ask... why you are staying? Oh, please don't mind me. I'm just waiting here. Friends go home together, don't they? What? - Bye. - - Goodbye. My house is this way. Kazumiya, stop following me around. Why? You should make other friends. I'll help you if you need. Isn't there anyone you want to be friends with? Hey! No. There's no one. She's always with Mr. Kunitachi. What do you think as class president? I don't really... I envy them seeming to have such fun together. A few days later She doesn't come these days... No. There's no one. Maybe I was a bit too harsh. Excuse me. Kazumiya. What's up? I found someone... I want as a friend. What? Riho Kurihara... She's from a wealthy family and has a good reputation among teachers. Did you try talking to her? No. I'm not good at talking. Could you please arrange something? Are you serious? Sorry, all of a sudden. There is no need to be sorry. I do not get to talk to my classmates too often so I am very grateful for this opportunity. What? Come here. Did you choose her because she doesn't seem to have friends? I have no idea what you're talking about. Are you two... dating each other? Where did you come up with that? You two seem to be very intimate. No way. I have no such feelings. Moreover, I'm a teacher! That shouldn't come in the way of love. To tell the truth, I wish to be a teacher's girlfriend. What? Please, no! I have no intention of dating any student in this school. I see... That will be solved if I quit school, then. Not really... Do something about this situation. You picked her. I'm leaving. What? Hey, Kazumiya. Kazumiya, wait. What happened? Nothing. I just thought... she wouldn't make a good friend. She is a little unique... But that aside. You're the one who wanted to be friends. It's rude to leave like this. Isn't it rude for her to confess her feelings like that? I'm sure that was a joke. In any case... I'm talking about your actions. Why are you siding with her, you pedophilic teacher! What? I'm telling you, I have no such intentions! Sorry for raising my voice... Anyway, you should at least try talking to her before leaving. I'm not talking to that bitch. Hey! Watch your language. Why... always me? What? I'm the one always getting scolded. It's so unfair. I too... am in love... with you! What? Was she... crying? Did I make my student cry? Wait... Didn't she say she was in love with me? What's going on?! Stupid me, stupid me... Stupid me, stupid me... Kazumiya Stupid me! I couldn't sleep well after all. What am I? A teenager? - Good morning. - - Good morning. What should I say to her? Good morning, Mr. Kunitachi. Kurihara... G-Good morning. I'm sorry to have asked you out all of a sudden. Oh, no. I discussed with my parents and they approved. I will never approve though. Also, give me some distance please. - Why? - - Well, you know... Please. Let go of me. Hey. Listen, Kurihara. Hey, Kazumiya! What do you want? Ah... Good morning. Good morning. She's pissed... Welcome back. Would you like to have dinner or have a bath? Or... have me first? Huh? It's the teacher's office. You shouldn't even be in here. I made lunch for you. Bon appetit. It's against my policy to accept these things. You should have it yourself. Is that so... The P.E. teacher gladly accepted it. He can if he wants. I won't. I see. No lunch... OK. I will keep that in mind next time. - Now, if you would excuse me. - - Uh... I will leave that here. Please do as you wish. What? Hey. I wasn't trying to eat it! Excuse me. Oh, it's you. Don't surprise me. Is that all you have to say? I too am in love... with you! Well, you know... How should I say... I do feel bad about how I was a little too harsh on you. I wasn't trying to be unfair or anything. What're you doing! I was going to throw this away. Don't waste food like that. - But that bitch made this, right? - - Don't call people that! I know. As a teacher, I can't accept it. So you eat it, Kazumiya. No way. - Come on. - - I refuse. But then... Maybe I'll try just a little. What? Hey. Ah... Kazumiya. Hey, Kazumiya. Give me some. You can't accept it, right? That's right. I'm all done. Was it good? Of course it's not good. You look really satisfied. Not at all. But let me know if you're troubled by that bitch's lunch again. I don't want to but I'll eat it out of need. I need to save money. Time to eat. You like pork cutlet, Mr. Sato? I will remember that. I'm glad. Thank you. Mr. Kunitachi. May I? Mr. Head Teacher. Yes, please. I see that's Mr. Sato of chemistry and Ms. Kurihara. Wasn't she in your homeroom? Yes. You know the students well. She's a promising student with excellent grades. She is always thoughtful toward us teachers as well. I ate it all up. You're so charming, Mr. Sato. You know, I've actually had lunch with her, too. Sleeping at someone's desk after eating a hearty meal, huh? Excuse me. I have come to retrieve my lunch box. Oh, hold on. Here you are. Oh, my. It's light. You have eaten it? Not me. Kazumiya ate it all. Is that so... It can't be helped if that's your policy. Sorry about that. But she seemed to like it a lot. Really? I am very glad. Say, Kurihara. I know it's kind of weird to ask you this but could you be friends with Kazumiya? She's a little difficult but good at heart. Most certainly. I believe we could get along since we share similarities. Like how we both are mad about you. You say, but I bet you're the same toward other teachers, too. You should stop acting like that. Do you mean - you want me all to yourself? - - No! I simply questioned your actions. There's no way I will go out with you. Ah, well... It's not that I dislike you. I just want to draw the line as a teacher. You are amusing, just as I thought. I do not remember ever saying that I want to be your girlfriend. What? To tell the truth, I wish to be a teacher's girlfriend. Mr. Kunitachi's girlfriend A teacher's girlfriend That being said, your score is rising. You're right behind chemistry's Mr. Sato and history's Mr. Tanaka. A wonderful profession educating children... There, a forbidden love is born... Teachers are... so wonderfully attractive. Pervert. You damn bitch. Oh, you were awake? In other words, it doesn't have to be me? Any teacher is a target for you? That is not the case. I like you because you seem to fall easily. It's Enomoto. I brought the class journal. Oh, hey. Thanks. Please don't perform lewd acts in school. Sorry to interrupt. You got me in trouble. That is so strange. Why should you get in trouble when I am just acting how I want. Because I'm a teacher and I'm supposed to give students a proper education. How cool. You must also want to flirt with him, don't you? What? I'm his friend. Don't group me in with you. Oh my. You two are so strict with yourselves. Anyways! Let's get back on track. Friends are precious. Especially those from high school can last a lifetime. You should play cards in class or go to karaoke. It's definitely more fun than staying here. We can do those things together with you. What a great idea! I'm not pleased. Why not? That's brilliant. How'd that happen? Ms. Kazumiya. Um... Could you become friends with me? Wow, that's great Kazumiya! Thanks, Enomoto. It was on my mind for some time. Since she's rarely in the classroom, I wanted to work as a bridge between the rest of the class. Stop meddling. What a great class president. Isn't she? Will you be happy if I become friends with her? Of course I will. Okay then. - What is your hobby? - - What? It's not a marriage interview! Ah... Making sweets and reading books. Mine is playing video games. Especially tactical role-playing-games. She's making conversation! I'm sorry. I'm not too familiar with video games. What's your favorite manga? Well guys, I have a meeting to go to. You're free to use this room. Are you okay? I just need to rest my brain and facial muscles. You're that unused to talking? Ms. Kazumiya, what do you think about having a relationship in school? I have no interest. Besides, all the boys are morons. You're right. They should learn to be mature like a grown-up. A grown up... - Like Mr. Kunitachi? - - What? Well, uh... yes. But he wouldn't be someone of romantic interest. Since he's a teacher. Romantic interest... What does that exactly mean? Is it defined as romance if you have feelings for someone? Huh? Romance... Ardent emotional attachment between two people or feelings associated with love. What did you talk about? Girl talk. It was fun. Yes. I didn't think we would talk so much. That's great. Don't you two want to go home together, then? - Are you riding the train? - - Yes. Alright then. Go home safely. I'll see you tomorrow. See you. Thanks for today, Enomoto. That's okay. I think she could get along with everyone. Yeah. Oh, and Kurihara too. Although she's more difficult in a way. But she's not a bad girl, so if you don't mind. I will try. So... Um... Is it okay if I also visit you occasionally? What? That is unnecessary. I'm not going to be friends with her. Ms. Kazumiya?! You scared us. I thought you went home. She is only using me to get close to you. Because she is in love with you. Huh? I have no idea what you are talking about. Yeah, right? What are you saying? That's not nice. Excuse me. Hey, Enomoto. You dropped something. Kunihiko Kunitachi No! Oh, boy. This isn't... It doesn't mean I like him or anything. Whatever. I've had enough... Mr. Kunitachi, I have friends now! I made a boyfriend in the same grade. Both have opened up to the others and now we're great classmates. You guys... We can now graduate from you. That's great. I'm happy for all of you! A dream? Of course... Good morning. Good morning. - Mr. Kunitachi. - - Ms. Koyuki. I hear you're popular among the students these days. Well, uh... yes. Even those who couldn't fit in at first seem attached to you. - I admire that. - - It's nothing special... Let's keep doing our best. Yes. I've been complimented... Why are you grinning? I'm not grinning. You have a big wide grin. So you like grown-up women like her? What? Mr. Kunitachi, I was looking for you. I couldn't find you at the teacher's office. - Let's go. - - Hey, don't cling on. What're you doing? Nothing. Don't friends hold hands? - What a lucky man you are. - - Wait... Mr. Kunitachi. - What is going on? - - Ms. Hasegawa. How shameful of you. Uh, no... You see... - This isn't... - - Isn't what? Ms. Hasegawa, these students are isolated in class. Mr. Kunitachi is providing counseling. Is that the case, Ms. Enomoto? Yes, I am helping out as well. I ask you to please condone their behavior. Oh, well... If the class president says so, I suppose it can't be helped. Please restrain from inappropriate behavior, though. Ah... yes. Thank you. We'll be careful. I'm counting on you. Was that good enough? Yes ma'am. Wow, that was so cool. I didn't say anything untrue. Bear in mind, you two. - Okay. - - Yes. And Mr. Kunitachi... I'm very sorry for what happened the other day. Oh, ah... I don't mind about that. About what? That his picture was in her train pass holder. Not that! About pushing you over. Oh my, you are also in love with Mr. Kunitachi? We can be friendly rivals. That's not it! I... Okay, okay. Class is starting. Come on, get going. - Yes. - - Okay. You too. There's too much drama everyday. But today, I was complimented by Ms. Koyuki... So it's all good. Okay. You dirty old man. K-Kazumiya! What about class? - It's P.E. now so I skipped out. - - Hey. Don't worry. I said I'll be in the nurse's office. You're even lying? Can't you cut me some slack? No, I can't. Get back to class. What's wrong with a little break! Why are you getting excited? It's me who gets in trouble. That's not my concern. You should at least go to the nurse's office. I'll go with you, if you need. What's wrong? Did anything happen? How you're always nice like that... It's not fair. Everyone falls for you. But for me, you're the only friend that I have. Mr. Kunitachi, I have friends now! I hope for that day to come soon. It's not like I'm going to leave you. Okay? You're so easy. Huh? That's why you get taken advantage of. What? Just go back to class. What was that? Um... I tried taking advantage of you. Huh? Excuse me. Is Ms. Kazumiya here? I knew it. Bye then. You were playing sick? Mr. Kunitachi? Is anything wrong? No... So you're troubled because students are all over you? Uh, well... yes. It might sound self-conscious but... I don't think it's too unusual for girls of that age. But some of them are overly touchy. Just go back to class. No one can stop anyone from falling in love. Why don't you date after they graduate? That's a pretty harsh one. What? Crepe Making - Mix the batter well. - - Yes. Don't forget the egg. Cooking at school feels new and is very fun. Why don't we make one extra for Mr. Kunitachi? Didn't he say he doesn't accept these kind of things? This time it's for a class assignment. It should be alright. In that case, let me help out too. We can give it as a group. But you are in a different group. Don't worry about that. I'm in, if it's a group project. I cracked the egg. I'll be watching form nearby. Both of you are not going to make your own? It's very easy. You made it in home economics? In that case I'll accept it. - Yes. - - Thank you. I cracked the egg. Wow. That's all? Mmm, it's good! - Really? - - I'm glad. You guys working together like this is wonderful. Do you think? It was fun making something together. Don't you also think so? Well, yeah. Alright, the next class is starting. Go study hard. - Yes. - - Excuse us. Hey, Kazumiya. Yes? I tried taking advantage of you. Oh, ah... You're starting to make friends. Next time let's have takoyaki at Mr. Kunitachi's house. Hold on. Where did that come from? Both are made of flour. After crepes come takoyaki. I can't wait. Me too. Hey, I didn't say OK! I'm the one who's being overly conscious. I love how he's so cute when teasing him. I want to tease him even more. You pervert. Is Mr. Kunitachi really just a friend to you? What? If so, I'm glad we don't have to fight over him. Teacher's Office Mr. Kunitachi. Hey, what's up? The other day... Just go back to class. Don't misunderstand. What? In some countries, friends kiss each other as a greeting. Yeah. You're right. Well, then. Dummy. Go home safely. Hello, Mr. Kunitachi. Huh? Oh, hi. Oh, wow. That lab coat... Are you Ms. Kazumiya? Nice to meet you. Kazumiya! The following day Eiko. Why didn't you wait for me? - Morning. - - Good morning. Guess what? Yesterday... I kissed Mr. Kunitachi. What? I'm not lying. I even have a witness. - Ms. Kazumiya? - - Yep. Ms. Kazumiya. You saw it, right? Where me and Mr. Kunitachi kissed. No, I didn't. Who are you? What? Okay. Then we could ask Mr. Kunitachi himself during lunch. You remember, don't you? No... You do, right? About what? Are you going to play dumb like that girl? Is it true, Ms. Kazumiya? Stop. Your troubling Mr. Kunitachi. Oh, well. Alright, I get it. My mistake. What? - We can just kiss right now. - - Huh? Stop it, sis! Sis? Gosh, Eiko... I was just joking. Some things you can't joke about! Enomoto! Is your hand alright? - Eiko! - - Don't come! I didn't know she had an older sister. Her name is Shiori Enomoto. She's a sophomore. Shiori... So you are in love with Mr. Kunitachi as well? Sisters fighting over the same man... How lovely. Huh? Don't be silly. I have no feelings for this dimwit. What? I just want to see how Eiko will react when her crush is taken. What a scum. Hey! Why are you even assuming Eiko has feelings for me? What? Of course she does. Your picture's in her train pass holder. That's true. Alright. Come with me and confess that you love her. What? What's important now is to make her feel better. For that, we need to fulfill her wish. Wow... How scummy can she get. Okay, let's go. However, we're going to go apologize together. What? There she is. Eiko. Sis... Mr. Kunitachi. I'm sorry for overreacting and causing so much trouble. I'll pay for the glass. Don't worry about that. Eiko. Mr. Kunitachi says he'll go out with you. So forgive us. Hey, that's not... Stop making fun of people! You're always doing things that I displease. I hate you! Eiko... And now you're even causing him trouble. That's overdoing it, just because you dislike me. I think you're wrong about that. But... Come on. Your feelings won't be understood unless you put it into words. I... like you lots, Eiko. I really do. I wanted to do something to help your relation with Mr. Kunitachi. But... it kept moving in the wrong direction. So... I'm sorry, right? I'm sorry. If that's what you say... For Mr. Kunitachi's sake, I have no choice but to forgive you. Eiko! I'm relieved. I put a stimulant in yesterday's crepe so I'm glad he didn't react to Shiori. You're the real scum. I'm joking. June They haven't come today... That's unusual... It might rain today. Kazumiya, don't surprise me. You get surprised too easily. It's not a miracle to bump into each other on campus. That's true. Where're the others? They went home to prepare for tomorrow. Prepare for tomorrow? It did rain after all. Here. You'll catch a cold. Please hold this for a moment. You didn't have that lab coat on at the opening ceremony. Is there a reason you're always wearing it? No... It's just fashion. Okay. Actually, I thought it might help catch attention. Catch attention? ...My attention? Would you have liked that? Whatever. Thanks... for holding my bag. Oh, yeah. I hope the rain lets up soon. I don't mind... if it keeps raining a little longer. Is anything wrong? Uh... no. Mr. Kunitachi. Is anything wrong? I bet there is. Hey, get off of me. Do you want to go to heaven? Or go to hell? What? I want to go to heaven. Wrong answer. Which makes it? ...Hell? Correct. Well then... Take care of yourself. No, I choose heaven! Stop! A dream... Kunitachi Yes. Huh? Wait... What's the matter? We had a promise to visit your place. Next time let's have takoyaki at Mr. Kunitachi's house. No, we didn't. Either way, today won't work. Go back home... - Mr. Kunitachi. - - What happened? Sorry, we didn't know you had a cold. You lack self-care. We will tend to you. Please let me use your kitchen. No... You'll catch my cold. Go home now. If you could get better, I'll gladly catch your cold. Passing it on won't make me better. Your meal is ready. Open wide. Say ahh. That's fine. I can eat myself. It's okay. Do not worry. Say ahh. It's good. I'm glad. Thanks for the meal. You're most welcome. Let me give you a cooling patch. Thanks. I brought ice cream. Later. Time for takoyaki! Okay. It looks delicious. - Thanks. - - Let's eat. Maybe I'm actually being pampered. To tell the truth, Mr. Kunitachi's not too appealing. Why's he even popular? - Huh, Eiko? - - What? That's because... I do not know about others but in my case, it was when we chose class officers... I'm sure Enomoto volunteered out of pure motivation, right? I thought he was so kind to say such a thing. Hmm... I remember that. For me, he scored the most points with that expression of his when he had my porridge. It's good. I can tell we're in love with each other. Quit fantasizing. With Mr. Kunitachi in bed, there's no one to stop her. Well then, tell us what you like about Mr. Kunitachi. So you are in love? Don't count me in together. I'm just... his friend. Then what's the best thing about this friend? What? The best thing...? That he spends time with me... I guess. That he... Spends time... With you... I understand. You don't need a reason to love someone. I'm telling you, I'm not! You're so pure. So, what about you, Shiori? What about? Sis, don't tell me! C'mon, Eiko. Don't be silly. - Be honest with me. - - I am. - You're getting red. - - Stop that. - She's blushing. - - She is. - Cut it out. - - Tell us. What's that for? You three were being funny, so... - Take us when we're looking cuter. - - I agree. - Shall we eat? - - Yep, let's eat. I really hope he gets better soon. I'm worried we might've got his cold. I'm gonna drink medicine. Let's come again once he recovers. Um... I forgot my phone. Ice cream is in the fridge! Found it. Water... Water... Kazumiya... Mr. Kunitachi... No... She resisted? Ms. Kazumiya. Did you find your phone? - How long did you take? - Sis. Y-Yes, I found it. She needs to work on team work. Stupid me, stupid me! Was that a dream? Wait... Or wasn't it? Ice cream is in the fridge! Reality... I guess. Then I... Alright... Kazumiya. You have time? Thanks for the other day. It helped me get better. Yes. Um... I had a fever and was feeling dizzy and I don't remember much. So... I apologize... for acting weird. I'm sorry! What do you mean weird? Huh? Ah, well... I mean... What was there weird about? In other words... When I woke up, I was... hugging you, Kazumiya. Therefore, I need to take responsibility - and quit as a teacher! - - That didn't happen. Huh? - You must have been dreaming. - - What? Really? Was I? Stupid me, stupid me! No... But... That was... Don't make me come out in your dream without asking. Because... you are just... my friend. Kazumiya... You are. You guys! What are you doing there? I was lured by the smell of forbidden love. Why is it Ms. Kazumiya? Please dream about me. Eiko's wish is my wish. So dream about her. - I'm welcome to that. - - Hold on! You guys... I take it back. There's no way a horny teacher like you who hugged me is my friend. What? Kazumiya... I'm just kidding. All of you are troublesome girls! Kazumi, do you want watermelon? Thanks, Grandma. At school... have you made friends? Hm? Yep. Is that so? Are you enjoying? Well, a lot goes on but... Yeah, it's fun. What a funny face.
