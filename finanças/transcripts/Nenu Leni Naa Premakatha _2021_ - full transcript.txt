My name is Radha! This is Balanagar area in Hyderabad. This is my house. My parents are asleep. You might say that I'm also sleeping. That's true! But I always stay conscious during my sleep. You might have noticed that I like dance by seeing this picture. But there is another thing which I like the most. Ram! Ram is my classmate. All these things in this box belong to Ram. I stole them. Ram is a revolutionary and a campaigner. He takes the lead against injustice. That is why I like him a lot. I feel sad if I don't see him for a day. If I see him, even my anklets tend to dance. But I'm scared to look into his blazing eyes. I succeeded as a dancer. Now my aim is win over Ram's heart. I wish to rest in his heart. This is the destiny of my life. But how? He's the fiery sun. I'm like a cool moon light. He likes tea and cookies. But I like traditional lemon rice and curd rice. In a belief that time will unite us, I rise up early than the sun... Waiting to see my beloved Ram! Let's see how this story of Radha ends up. NENU LENI NA PREMAKATHA My sweetheart! [sign language] Idly. Lemon rice. I've packed two boxes. One for you and one for Raheem chacha. I'm aware of it. I have added more chillies as Raheem chacha likes it. -Uncle! -Are you here, dear? Your favourite coconut sweet. Did you like it? TYAGARAYA KALAKSHETRAM I might tie these anklets... But to dance, I must see Ram. My eyes should see him for sure. Despite knowing that he would be late, there is happiness in waiting for him. Sir is coming, come soon. -Coming. -Lakshmi! -Hey! -Sorry, sir. "Come to me... Come to me" "Oh son of the Yadava clan" "Lord come to me" "Glorious like a gem and gallant" "Lord come to me" "Worshipped by millions" "The mightiest in a battle field" "Oh captivator of hearts" "Lord come to me" "Rule over my heart" [classical notes] [classical notes continue] "Love is immortal and beautiful, it brought us together." "Love is a boon, it's delightful, I pledge I'm yours." "You are the light of my life" "You're the tune to my song." "Your thought is ecstatic." "It's get distracted because of you, so listen to me..." "Come to me... Come to me" "The one who lifted a great mountain" "Lord come to me" "Oh Lord who provides for the poets" "Lord come to me" "Oh slayer of the enemy kings" "The literary treasure of the Bharatha kingdom belongs to you" "Come to me fast" "Lord come to me" "Rule over me" -See you! -Bye! [reciting classical dance notes] We have a class tomorrow. Do you remember it? Yes I do. She thinks that she is good at reminding. Hello! What's this? -Colour. -Is that all? -Colours. -What? -I was running... -Then? -And I slipped. -Hmm! I didn't see you. Then? -Didn't see it was you. -That's it? Yes. That's it. I'm not asking why have you done this? I'm asking the solution for this. I have Nirma washing powder at my house. I'll wash it. Should I give it now? Change your shirt after reaching home and give me this. But you don't want to apologize? -I did it already. -When? A while ago. Be it love or regret... It shouldn't be conveyed through words. Must be expressed by the eyes. Must be expressed by looking into the eyes. -Sorry! -Don't! My intention was not to get apologies from you. I intended to make you speak confidently, looking into my eyes. Washing powder Nirma, I have it at my home too. [voice on radio] Hello! Hello! This is Krish calling... Hello! Calling from 83.20 MHz. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Hello? Hello? Hello? My name is Krishna. I'm an electronics engineer. I like Science. And I like the concept of sound in Science. I like Einstein and his inventions. As Einstein said "Energy cannot be destroyed." Sound is energy. As energy has no end, so does the sound. If a sound is muted, it doesn't mean it vanished. This universe has absorbed that sound and hid in it. Science didn't claim that we can hear the sounds hidden in universe. But my heart says that is possible. Hence these trials and experiments. To decide the result of this attempt and to know the future... We need to search for some valuable conversations hidden in this universe. We have discover and restore them... And make policy makers to listen to them. Sir CV Raman, Srinivasa Ramanujan... And now KV Krish. That's it! It's going to happen. TYAGARAYA KALAKSHETRAM -Gopi. -Guys arrange them, faster. -Hey Poorna, take this. -Yes. Your Ram is here. What's up? Are you going to the class? No. We're going home. Good. You've gained confidence. You're able to talk by looking into my eyes. Seems like you're in a hurry? That's my job. It's a seminar. The topic is about development of world with human relations. Oh! 'Kakarlapudi Venkata Seetha Raama Rao.' -Who is he? -Read the last two letters. Rao. The letters before it. It's Rama. -Is that you? -Yes. You've cut short your name to Ram because it's too long? No. That's my grand fathers name too. It's not just a name to me. But it's a succession gifted to me by my grand father. Everyone calls me Ram, because the name is lengthy. If people don't mind it, I like to be referred with full name. Ram! -Everything is ready. -I'm coming. What's the purpose of life, if the humans don't love each other? How can we succeed in life if we can't help each other? Let's take an oath today. He's a leader. He conducted a meeting to express his love. He speaks everything but the point. Go ahead and express your love. I'll loose my respect if I express in front of this crowd. A smile and an accost. So you won't say it? Alright, let me do this. -A word with love. -Sir! Any doubts? Radha loves you, sir. Oh god! I love you too. Radha deserve's this applause. She understood my concept. She started loving everyone. Clap for her. As I love Radha... I love Seetha, Ravi and Basha too. I even love the guy who tied banner and I love everyone. This is our concept. He understood my intention in other way. Damn! I congratulate Radha for taking an initiation to join this movement. Lift the puppets. -Vasu! -Hi, what's up? -I want to talk about a guy. -Is it? His name is Ram. -I'm know him since long. -Okay. Yes! -I can't take my eyes of him. -Hmm! I couldn't talk to him for the first time. Give me your hand. -He shook my hand like this. -Is it? It had been long since he left my hand... But the feel of his touch is not leaving me. I should wait till tomorrow to meet him again. Technology! The development of science. - We all know it's useful for the nation. -Where is he? -It's time for technological revolution. -[clears throat] What are you looking at? Nothing, sir. We've decided to love everyone. So don't call me sir. Nothing. I was passing by and I heard some interesting topic. Is it? Let's go inside. -Excuse me, sir. -Yes, come in. Come. -She is Radha, dance student. -Hi! As your topic seemed interesting, she was peeping from the window. Oh! Please sit. This is Ham Radio. Meaning, our radio. What is the use of this ham radio? We come across many cyclones and floods. Many villages drowned. There was no electricity. Electricity and telephone lines were damaged. Towers have collapsed. The total communication system had collapsed. Ham radio is the one, which helps us in such situation. For the electronic devices to work first the frequency should match. Frequency means waves. We can't destroy the waves. They have no end and they stay forever. -The main requirement of ham radio is... -Sir, battery. Okay. To telecast it? -It's... Frequency. -Good. -Then to operate the ham radio? -Permission. Very good. Dear Seetha! It's not Seetha,sir. I'm Radha. I thought you're Seetha because you're sitting beside Rama. -Radha! -Sir. -I want to present this to you. -To me? Study it, use it and demonstrate this to fellow students next month. -Ram! -Sir. Come and take this. I didn't think that the ham radio... Will take over my love story into it's hands. You said we should start loving... And say it's everyone. You ask me to look into your eyes... And if I did, you call it as confidence. You sit beside me an pose like a great man. You shake your hand and you take it back before I feel you are mine. I don't know how to understand you. Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Anybody there? Hello? Please connect. Please connect. Hello? I'm, from 83.20. Please connect. Anybody there? Hello? -Please talk. Please talk. Who's this? -Oh God! Please connect. -Hello? Hello? -Hello! Hello! Looks like someone got connected. -Hello? Hello? -Hello! Who's on line? Hello? -Hello. -Hello. -Hello. -Hello. Hello! I bought you all this crap. Thank you Varsha. Thank you so much. Hi Einstein. What's up? [machine beeping] Hey! Hello? What happened? What was it? I got a solution for my problem. So I get to party. Let's go. Varsha please! Let me complete this. I think I'll complete this project later. Let's party. Come on. If the sun doesn't rise in the sky... I'll sacrifice my brightening heart for it. I will bring up the sunshine by working hard with my muscle power. I'm a droplet of sweat. I'm the common man who represents hard work. -There are the blazes of fire to the east. -Hey Vasudha! The person standing in the middle is Ram. Ram sir! Radha, what are you doing here? -We came to Shobha Naidu's programme. -Okay! She is Vasudha my friend. -Hi, sir! -Hi, Vasudha. I'm Ram. Radha told about you. You are a great man. It's simple. I follow a saying. 'To live, we have to fight.' Everyone call this as a revolution. But I call it as life. Didn't your friend tell you that she is president of Ham Radio club? Is it? She didn't tell me. Radha! Do you maintain secrets? What's your next plan? -Ram, sir. -Yes. If you don't mind can you get us some cookies? I don't mind. Radha's friend is my friend too. I'll be back in a minute. Do you have any idea why I called Ram with us? Because you can't go alone. You're too shy to express your love. He's always busy with his campaigns. Then how can you spend some private time? So I planned this. -Cookies for you. -Thanks a lot. -What is this? -Biryani. Hyderabad is famous for Charminar and Biryani. It's not possible to show Charminar to your people so take this Biryani for them. Thank you. -I'll take a leave. -Your bus is here. Bye! -Oh God please! -Radha, bye! -Radha, where do you stay? -Balanagar. Oh! Take a bus till Panjagutta and then take an auto rickshaw. -Ram! -Yes. Let's hire an auto rickshaw from here. Don't know how he will react? Oh god! What is he thinking? Auto! Let's go! Thank god he agreed. Sorry if I'm troubling you. It's okay. Both of them are not so speaking out. I should do something. -Popins are tasty, right? -Yes. Pity that they don't have another topic to discuss other than popins. I should increase the dose. Sir, where to? -Jeedimetla. -Get in. Hey, we have hired the auto, right? Sir I won't charge him. I'm just trying to help. Please let me know if you don't like it. Sir, get in from this side. No, come this side. -Alright. -Get in from this side. Move man. -Oops! -Let's go. Kindly adjust sir. Oops! We've reached finally. Sir... You can talk all you want with her... But what you speak before you say good bye, would remain in her heart... Walk four steps with her alone, If possible walk three more steps. That would be seven steps in total. See you sir. -Where's your home? -A little further. -I'll walk with you till there. -Okay. I met professor Jai today, He asked about Ham Radio. Are you using it? Yeah! I heard some sounds emanating from it, Before I could figure out they stopped. Some one is trying to connect to our frequency. Simple! If you press the button on your hand set they can listen to us... If you release it, you would be able to listen to them. -As simple as that. -Okay. -Shall we go? -Okay. By the way. The auto driver was an interesting guy, right? He talked too much. Did you take a note of his registration number? -I have it in my mind. -Please share it with me. No need. I'll take care of him. Don't do that. I really want to thank him. "My heart is awaiting to welcome you" "Life would be beautiful if you and me are one" "I swear my life is yours" "My dreams should come true, I await that day..." "For you and me to be one" "My heart is inclined towards you. This distance should fade away" "Come to me... Come to me" "I'm talking to you... Pay heed to me...

Please connect... Is anybody there? Hello. Please respond, please connect. Hello... Hello. Please connect... Is any body there? Can you hear me? This is Krishna calling from 83.20... -Hello! -Excellent! Fabulous! Fantastic! I am Krishna, connecting from 83.20. -My name is Radha. -Ms. Radha, which device are you using? -Ham Radio. -Where are you from? Balanagar. Hyderabad. I'm also from Hyderabad, just besides Hitec city. Where is this Hitec city? How come you don't know about Hitec city, being a resident? Okay! Leave it. Ms. Radha, since when are you using Ham Radio? Our college had a plan to set up a Ham Radio club... So they gave me one. You are the first person I'm talking to on the device. That's great Ms. Radha... Actually, I'm a techie... Experimenting and inventing are my hobbies. I've invented a device called Resonator recently, I can connect to different frequencies using this. I was trying it out, and you are the first to connect to it. I'm very happy for it. Which college in the city do you attend? -Do you know Kala Khsetra? -In Eden bagh... Very famous college. You are right. I'm a Kuchupudi student now, I learned music earlier. Wow! That sounds great Ms. Radha... I'm very happy today... My experiment is a success and I got to speak to a good classical dancer. I need some information regarding Ham Radio. Always welcome. Write down my number. 98660- 88352. That's a very long number. How many numbers are there in it? Ten... Ten numbers are there. It should be ten numbers. This is my WhatsApp number... Send a Hi... I'll forward the material. Is PDF format okay with you? I'm literally clueless about what you are talking. Okay! Forget it. Tell me your number, I'll share the files with you. -7, 6, 5, 6, 7, 6. -Okay. Give me your mobile number Ms. Radha. But this is my phone number. That's right. Why would girls give their numbers to guys? I swear... -That's my phone number. -You are an artist and you act well. It' okay. No worries... Search on Google, you'll find tons of information. Can't I get information from a library? Why to take such risk Ms. Radha... It's simple, open Wikipedia, you'll get all info that you need. I've searched in encyclopedia, but I found nothing there. Not encyclopedia Ms. Radha, I said Wikipedia. Wikipedia? I'm literally clueless again about what you are talking. I get it. You won't read on mobiles nor computers... You only read from books. Okay. I have a collection of books in my library... I'll give them to you myself. You don't worry... It's a waste if I can't do it for an interesting woman like you. -Hello Ms. Radha. -Hello Mr. Krishna. Hello... Not Radha, Varsha here. Hey! I thought my love story was going on well... Finally there's a twist. Who's Radha? -Actually Varsha... -Guys shouldn't be cool... But should be hot like you, That's why I fell for you... -Let's go party. -Hey! Stupid, My attempt was a success, I connected to a frequency. I'm so happy today. You must keep me happy as well, you said we would watch a movie together? We still have two hours for the second show? We are not going to watch some old movie, to go directly... We are about to watch a Bollywood movie, must have a beer before that... Let's go. -Vasu! -Yes... -Last night on the Ham Radio-- -I'll kill you, I'll kill you if you talk about that Ham Radio. Did you tell him that you love him? -No. -Did he at least? I said no. Why are you getting furious? I came here to tell you something, but you are not letting me to. Tell me. I got in touch with a guy on our Ham Radio last night. Which means another king has entered this queens life. Not that. Smart guy! He's aware about your craze for Ham Radio... What's his name? Krishna! Looks like Radha is inclined towards Krishna? Not like that. -Teacher. -What? The puppets got entwined. This is what you are supposed to do. Come up with a plan to kiss your love interest. Hello! Is any body there? Please connect... -Hello! Is any body there? -I'll be back. Hello! I'm from 83.20, please connect... -Hello Mr. Krishna. -Hello Ms. Radha, you recognised me. You are the only person who speaks to me on Ham Radio, right? Sorry! I got disconnected last night. -Disconnect? -When shall we meet? No. We can't meet. What? Don't you want books on Ham Radio? Yeah! I want them. When and where? Ah! Could you come to the temple in Srinagar colony? -Super! When? -Tomorrow. -At what time? -Evening 4'o clock, at the entrance. -Okay, done. -Here we go. [temple bell ringing] Radha dear, what are you doing here? I'm waiting for Geeta. I'm headed towards the colony, you want me to drop you? -No uncle... -Alright. -She might come any time soon. -Alright. She asked me to wait at the entrance, where is she? We were supposed to meet here, why didn't he come? Time is 5:30. It's 5:30, why didn't he come? Looks like it's about to rain, and she hasn't come yet. It's hot out here, how long should I wait? Hell with you! All these guys, never keep their word, Next time he calls, I would teach him a lesson. The sky is thundering, it will rain now. Damn it. Damn! It started to rain. If I leave I would miss her. No. Let me wait for her. I'll leave after giving her books. Krishna! She's here. God! I got caught. So! You got drenched for that girl on Ham Radio? Yeah. -Why? -To give her some books. Hey! Do I have to tell you every time? Sorry ma'am. You can courier her the books, send PDF through email or WhatsApp her... You could've sent a link. But you didn't. You had plans to meet her right? No Varsha. A girl and the rain don't get annoyed just like that... Symptoms are evident. Am I right? Yes, you are right. You could have gone to a safe place before it rained, did you? No I didn't. You intended to show off that you got drenched for her, right? Not at all Varsha. She's an innocent girl... I thought she might get confused, that's why. -Bearer! -Ma'am! Don't you know to serve us another drink before our glasses get empty? Stupid! Get us two large drinks. Out. Enlighten me, what did you like about her? She's traditional. How do you know? Did you meet her? I heard her. How? Stop! She told it herself. What the hell? Am I not tra... tra... -Traditional. -Traditional? You are a modern girl Varsha. What do you know about tradition? Tradition! My great grand father used to have his first peg with soda and the next, neat. My dad used to do the same, and even me now. I have my drinks the same way. Is this not upholding the tradition? -Is this not tradition? -You are right. Absolutely. -Good lord! -What else? -Nothing else. -You are hiding. -No! -You are cheating on me Krishna. -No Varsha. -Then bring it on. She's a good classical dancer. -Classical dancer? -Yes. You mean I can't? -Are you underestimating me? -Please Varsha, don't. Music! Let him call, I'll teach him a lesson. Come on, call me. Hello Ms. Radha. Hello Mr. Krishna. You said you would come? This is last call, don't call me again. Ma'am, mistake is your's, how could you punish me? Poor guy! Is it? I made you wait for two hours right? You shouldn't be telling my dialogues Ms. Radha. How could you make a girl wait for you? There's nothing wrong if you wait to collect the books. If you were a girl... While every one is staring at you when you were alone... Then you would know my pain. I came, even got drenched in the rain. I would've believed that it rained, if hadn't come yesterday. I told you that I would come and give you the books myself. If I was busy, I would've told you... -Trust me. -Alright... -Tell me what next? -I'll come to Kala Khsetra tomorrow. No. It's not possible tomorrow. I'm going to watch a morning show movie tomorrow. My favourite hero's. Let me guess. You must throw a good party if I guess it right. Aright, go ahead tell me. -Mahesh babu. -Nope. -Prabhas! -Who's he? Nope. Got it. Power star Pavan Kalyan, right? I don't know them at all, never heard of those names too. Just say that you don't like them. Or else we fans would get hurt. I am a huge fan of Kamal Hassan. Kamal Hassan! Even I am a big fan of him. But none of his movie is up for release now, right? Don't you know, Sagara Sangam got released recently? Sagara Sangamam? Was supposed to watch it on the day of release... But our CM's was on a visit that day to our town. Despite NTR being a CM and an actor himself, tickets are still being blocked. That's awful right? NTR is not our Chief Minister now, KCR is. He is not a movie hero, he's a real hero. No it's Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao. Big mistake... Kalvakuntla Taraka Rama Rao! He's the future CM of Telangana. Our President is Gnani Jail Singh, beware he would throw you in jail. Is it? Jail Singh is the President, NTR is our CM. Who's our cricket team captain? Is it Kapil Dev? Thank God! Now you got it right. Alright, I don't know much about politics... Talk about movies, did you see Sagara Sangamam? I watched it on TV many times. I watched it on YouTube as well. I downloaded the torrent too. You talk well some times and weird the next moment, Leaving me clueless about what you talk, -Was the movie good? -Fantastic! It's a master piece. Oh! Sounds great... Hey! It's my birthday tomorrow. Is it? I wish you a very happy birthday Ms. Radha. Are you inviting your friends over to the party? Why not, Coconut sweet from Raheem chachas outlet. -1/4 th Kg per head. -[man laughing] Coconut sweets for birthday party? -Stop laughing. You are making me furious. -Okay. I like Raheem chacaha the most after my parents. Try out his delicacies at SR Nagar outlet. Forget my birthday, you would serve those sweets in your marriage as well. Sorry! Once again I wish you a happy birthday Ms.Radha. Okay... Okay bye. Is she trying to fool me? Let us again listen to what she spoke. I'm a huge fan of Kamal Hassan. [gadgets beeping] Despite NTR being a CM and an actor himself, tickets are still being blocked. No it's Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao. No separate CM for Andhra and Telangana. There's something fishy about what she's talking. What could it be? Where is this Hitec city? She said she doesn't know about Hitec city. She doesn't know about Wikipedia. That's a very long number. How could she ask if a mobile number had ten digits? She said she never heard our movie stars names before. I'm clueless about what you're talking. She doesn't know about WhatsApp... Said that Jail Singh is the President... No separate CM for Andhra and Telangana. She said Sagara Sangamam released recently? SAGARA SANGAMAM RELEASE DATE. Oh my God! Sagara Sangamam released on June 3rd 1983! N T Rama Rao was the CM in 1983. Who was the President of India in 1983? Jail Singh! There were no computers and mobiles back then, That's why she doesn't know about them. Which means Ms. Radha is from 1983. Did I time travel and got connected to 1983? Am I speaking to a girl from 1983? Did I connect to the year 1983! 19-83! My God! Did I decode the frequency of 1983? Yes! My experiment is a success. Hello... Hello Ms. Radha. Hello Mr. Krishna. How was Sagara Sangamam? Absolutely amazing! Can I ask you a few questions? Sure you can. -How do you travel to college? -In an auto. How do you get back home from a railway station? In an auto or a city bus. -Your favourite TV program? -Chitralahari! -Latest movie? -Sagara Sangamam. -Old movie that you like? -Daagudu Moothalu. How do you cook your food? Most of them use a kerosene stove, but we cook on gas. -Hot water? -In a broiler. Super! Ms. Radha... I must tell you something, Listen to me carefully. -What's that? -You are in 1983. Oh! Is it? -What did you study? -Electronics engineering. Why? Even a little boy from our village knows very well that this is 1983... As if you invented something. Don't mock me please, you are from 1983, I swear. Did you injure your head or what? -What happened to you? -My experiment is a success... Don't get surprised... I'm not from the year 1983. -Oh is it? -I'm from 2020. I mean I'm from the future, 37 years ahead of you. Mr. Krishna... Not just teasing a girl is considered harassment, This is harassment too. Alright. I understood that you won't believe me. I would prove it to you tomorrow, is that okay? Then you will believe my words. Bye, good night. Okay, bye. Good night. This guy says he's from 2020. God knows. What is he talking? What happened? Why did you come, it's raining heavily? Vasudha! Should tell you something. About whom, Ram or Ham? -Obviously Ham. -Bring it on. -Which year is this? -1983. -But this guy is not from 1983. -Is it? He's from 2020. How did he travel to 2020, by a village bus or on a horse back? How would I know? He is not from 2020 or 1940... He must be from your street or could be your neighbour. Did you tell about Ham to Mr. Ram? He is out of town to attend some meetings. Tell him after he comes, he'll find that guy and break his bones. Hello... Hi Ms. Radha, what's up? Cleaning my anklets with tamarind juice, Tell me? I have a lot to do. You don't trust me right? You want me to tell you about tomorrows news? May be then you would believe me. 1983 June, old news paper. Religious fights happened in Hyderabad. Ms. Radha, religious fights would happen tomorrow in Hyderabad, Especially at your Raheem chachas place in SR Nagar, Avoid going there tomorrow, there's going to be a curfew. Really! Okay I won't go. Bye. Curfew at Raheem chachas place it seems. [siren wailing] [indistinct voices] [commotion] Oh no! Raheem chacha! Don't come this side. -Raheem chacha! -Let's get out of here. -Auto is leaving. -Go away... Get out of here... -Raheem chacha! -Get out of this place... -Don't come. -Let's go. Why did you come here? Please go away my dear. -Curfew is in force, leave. -Dear, leave this place. Raheem chacha! Ms. Radha... Hello. -Tell me. -I am sorry. Stop crying, Hope Raheem chacha is safe? -I am scared. -Why? -I am scared because of you. -What? Why did you attack Raheem chacha? Why would I do that? I know it's you. I told you what I saw on my computer. You told me and did it. Please don't say that Ms. Radha. How were you so sure, if you're not the perpetrator? Trust me. I'm from 2020. Your future is our past. I told you about a small incident which hurt you, Sorry about that. Okay leave it. Tell me today's date. To kill someone tomorrow? Please Ms. Radha, just tell me, I will tell you about an incident. -June 24. -June 24th, okay. Cricket world cup final is set to happen on June 25th, right? Let me tell you who will win. Would you believe me? India is about to win the world cup for the first time. Two teams will play and some one would win? I'm telling you that India would win. 50:50 chance... You would say they won because you knew it... If they loose, you won't show up again. Okay. India would bat first, is that fine? 50:50 chance. You want me tell about the man of the match? You might name the best player of the season. Alright Ms. Radha, pick a pen and a paper. -Tell me. -1st batting India. -I wrote down. -Check it tomorrow. If what I spoke is wrong consider me wrong. And stop talking to me. -Good night. -Good night -See you dad. -Okay dear. [voices on radio] Is that cricket commentary? Yes it is. -What about toss? -West Indies won it. They chose to bowl and we are batting dear. Gavaskar out for two, caught behind, bowling by Robertson. -Dad, Sunil Gavaskar got out? -Was bowled out by Roberts. Okay. Sunil Gavaskar scored just two runs. -Srikanth on 38 LBW by Malcom Marshal. -Brother! How much did Srikanth score? He scored 38. Out LBW by Malcom Marshal. This is correct. And bowled! Mohinder Amarnath gone for 26 runs. Damn it! Anwar, let's go to college. Every one is busy listening to cricket commentary, what about you? Even I was listening, Amarnath got out, so switched it off out of frustration. -How much did he score? -26, got bowled by Holding. Take me to college. Stop here... Sandeep Patel is out and India is in trouble. -Sandeep Patel is out? -Yes. -How many runs did he score? -27 runs, bowled by Garner. -It's a four. -Kapil Dev is playing well. Hey Radha! I will buy you a biryani if India wins. Arrange money to buy me a biryani. Kapil Dev is dismissed, caught by Holding. Kapil Dev is gone. [commentary running on radio] -A wicket is down. -Looks like we will loose. Hey! India will win. Our nation would be proud of them. [commentary running on radio] What happened, the match is over? Innings is over. Okay! How much did we score? -What? -What's the score? -All out for 183. -What? -We will win for sure. -We are not the players. Hey! Shut up. Vivian Richards is playing. Is it? But Radha is predicting. What, is it? [mimicking] Hello! Mohinder Amarnath will take three wickets. -Three wickets. -Okay. Swear on my anklets. I will give you a party if India wins. Okay, what will you give? Hmm! What ever you want. Be ready. Radha! Vivian Richards is gone. Radha! You were right. We won. KRISHNA 2020. I'm from 1983. He's from 2020? SRI TYAAGARAYA KALA KSHETRAM Ram, can I have a moment with you? I'm busy right now Radha. Ram, I need to talk to you, please. Not now, can't you see? I must tell you something. -Let's meet in the evening. -Fix it properly. Hey, mind what you are writing. -You. -Hey. Ram, it's urgent. -Tell me. -I'm talking to some guy on Ham radio. -Is this urgent? -His name is Krishna. You are Radha. Radha and Krishna. I must feel jealous, that would make you happy, right? No. You must know about him. Why should I know about him, is he an icon like Cheguera or Bhagat Singh? Guys you spoke about were from past, he is from the future. Go now, go mind your work. Ram... You don't trust me? He says he's from 2020. He is 37 years into the future. The story is good. It would be amazing, if it was a play. Fit for the competition. I swear, it's not a story Ram, Every thing he said is happening. A parrot predicts every ones future with just a handful of cards. Deception always wins as long as innocents exist. So you don't trust me. I trust, that he is an intelligent guy. Ask him to come, let's do something good to the society using his intelligence. Here, have popins, you would feel refreshed. Have popins? Thank you. Why are you laughing? I'm telling the truth, It's true Varsha believe me. Seriously Varsha, it's true. Okay, I'm sorry. So you mean you travelled back in time to 1983? You met a girl, and you want me to believe you? Krishna, just tell me that you are talking to some other girl. I will feel proud that my boy friend is flirting with someone. But you don't need to cook up such stories. The one who gives a solution to Kashmir problem, Would receive 'Youth peace prize'. You sent it me on FB, do you remember? So what? You must know about the problem to get a solution. I gathered many books to research about it. Not even a single book was informative. Only three of them were aware about the solution to this problem. -Who are they? -Jawahar Lal Nehru, Mohammed Ali Jinnah... And the ruler of Kashmir back then, Raja Hari Singh. -Which year did this happen? -1947. -Is it? -They are not alive today, But I feel the words they spoke, their radio interviews... Must have been stored some where in this universe. Because, as Einstein said energy cannot be destroyed. The device which I designed... Using the Resonator, if I could connect to the frequencies back then, My experiment would be a success. This is how I got connected to Radha. I not happy that I connected to Radha, but I'm happy I succeeded in my experiment. I reached till 1983, 1947 is not too far. I wish you a very happy journey, Go to 1947 or rot in 1983 or go to 2099, I don't care. Brother, bill please. Ms. Radha, do you trust me at least now? -I trust you. -Good. What do I call you? Call me Krishna. No. I will call you 'the future man'. Oh! Like a super man? Hey, super man is nothing, he just flew. But you flew across time. I didn't fly, I fell down instead. From 2020 to 1983. -How were you able to? -You know about the time machine? -Yes I do. -I invented something similar. -Why? -To be your friend. How old are you Ms. Radha? Hey! How can you ask the lady about her age? Okay... Sorry... Alright, till where should one study to get into this dance course? Clearing SSC would do. When did you pass SSC? Five years! In that case, your should be 20 or 21 right? You guessed it right, I'm 21. Oh! You are the future man, right? You are an intelligent guy. If you are 21 in 1983, you must be 57 in 2020. What purpose do I have with an old woman like you? Hello! Remember that you are now talking to Radha who is 21. -Which means, can we be friends? -Yes of course. Okay future man, tell me what's happening in your time zone? Oh! There's a lot to say, tell me what do you want to hear about? Okay, how about love stories between guys and girls? Oh yes! Every one has at least two or three affairs. My goodness! Girls can't express their love, even the guys aren't courageous. Do you have the courage to say? As I said, propose in the morning and hangout in the evening. From the next day we start dating. What do you mean by dating? A guy and a girl will live together for a few days. What?... Aren't you supposed to live together after marriage? They live together and if it works out they will get married. Oh my God! How could they? Hey! Are you dating someone? I don't have the intention to. Why? You said that all guys date, and you're not dating anyone? Do you have any problem? Be it any time girls remain the same. They call bad guys as rowdy and good guys as incapable. It's okay. Tell me about your love story. Can you question your elders? I'm not asking 57 year old Radha. I'm asking 21 year old Radha. I'm madly in love with a guy. -His name is Ram. -Did you propose him. I tried to. Till the moment I meet him... I knit beautiful words, to pour my heart out. But the moment I see him... I forget all those words. 'Admiration' -What? -This is called admiration. May be. Even I don't know how to propose him. Have you written a love letter ever? -Damn! -Damn? If you express your love through a letter, it's called a love letter. It's not wrong. When you can't talk with your loved ones, then try to write your feelings as words. The words in the letter will have a great impact on his heart. I thought of it. But I don't know where to begin. You want me to help? I'll write if you help me. For sure. Take a pen and a paper. -Are you ready. -Yeah! Now, try to remember Ram in your mind. Your pen starts writing automatically. 'To his majesty, the king and my beloved darling' 'To his majesty, the king and my beloved darling' "To his majesty, the king and my beloved darling" You're singing superbly. Tell me the next line. 'Listen to me my love.' 'Listen to me my love.' "Listen to me my love." Let's sing together. [in unison]"To his majesty, the king and my beloved darling" "Listen to me my love." "Every second passes like an era for me." "Please come to me." "To his majesty, the king and my beloved darling" "Listen to me my love." "Every second passes like an era for me." "Please come to me." 'Did I ask for jewels or gems?" "I care only for your happiness." "Did I ask for a boon or some luck?" "I care about a smile on your face." "Please appear in front of me..." 'Just for once, just like that" "Every second passes like an era for me." "Please come to me." "To his majesty, the king and my beloved darling" "Listen to me my love." "My heart plays in joy when I think of you" "It's happening for the first time" 'My lips sweeten by calling your name." "They are delighted by you." "My eyes are filled with your dreams." "Every second passes like an era for me." "Please come to me." "To his majesty, the king and my beloved darling" "Listen to me my love." "Every second passes like an era for me" "This is all because of you." The campaign we're going to do is new and tough than what we did till now. Do you have any idea who is our target this time? Chief minister. We've got orders from the high command. All these days we fought against the methods of the government. But this time we got material from the high command against a person. We received some posters. We have to paste those posters in front of CM's residence. Security will be high. But we have to finish the target. Panjagutta, Abids, Assembly... and at Secunderabad railway station, we have to burn the effigies of the CM. This is high commands plan. 'Dear comrades' "To our group, fighting for the lives of other people," 'Revolutionary greetings' As part of our plan... [door knocks] Why are you here? I saw someone roaming suspect fully outside. He was observing this room. I'm here to warn you about that. There he is. -Hey! Who's Ramu here? -It's me. You? Police! Hello! What's going on here? Sir, we're practising for the next week competition. For competition? Okay, Who are these guys? They are our cultural team, sir. Cultural team? -He performs mono action. -That bald head guy? Those four members are folk dancers. I'm classical dancer. Who is the guy standing in the centre? He is our cultural secretary. This bearded guy is your cultural secretary and they are your cultural team? Good! [sings classical song] [sings classical song] Something is fishy. Sing Psalms. Play devotional songs. But don't involve in revolutions and campaigns. Sir! Paper... Even I worked as cultural secretary. Even I practised a lot. But... With doors opened. If you hadn't been here, police would have arrested us. Paper? There's some magic in Ram's touch. He expressed his love with his actions. Isn't that enough? What's the need of saying it with his words? But I like to hear it from him. Hello Radha! My girl friend was impressed reading your letter. You were superb. I'm an idiot. I share about my love story with everyone. But others are hiding secrets from me. I got you. I like a girl. Her name is Varsha. Her name is beautiful. -Is she pretty? -Yes. She is. -Is she prettier than me? -You shouldn't ask that. Your age is 57. It's the age of my mother if she was alive. Who is more beautiful than a mother? -Did you hear the sound? -What was that? I slapped myself. Because I spoke wrong. Does your interests match with each other? Not at all. But she encourages my interests... And I respect her interests. When the union of interests is called love, Respecting each others interests is also called love. -Did you meet her parents? -Yeah, recently when I was high on booze. Oh! Do you mean cool drinks? No it's liquor. Alcohol. Do you booze? I don't drink. She does. Oh god! Do woman booze? Isn't it wrong? What's wrong with that? It's a fashion these days. Our parents deny if we think of drinking coffee for the second time. Then why did you choose that kind of girl? A heart which looks for a logic in everything... Doesn't look for logic regarding loved ones. That's it. Wives serve the drunkard husbands. But in your case it's different. You find her and get her home whenever she is high on booze. Is it? Or you perform all the spiritual rituals and take her blessings? While I'm supporting your love, you're insulting my love. You're getting angry. I was just teasing you. Leave this aside. When are you giving your love letter? Tomorrow. 'Student union leader injured.' Ram is conducting a campaign right? I'll give him after that. Tomorrow police are going to attack the campaign. Does Ram get injured? Not so serious. I read tomorrow's newspaper of your time. It was mentioned that student union leader was injured. Be with him, and please take care of him. Got to go now. Bye. [sloganeering] [sloganeering] Dear friends, according to information we have, The home minister is passing by this way. I request you not to raise slogans against... Him and his government. We are here to bring our problems to his notice. Don't panic and get angry when police or others come here. Are you the student leader? Do you have the permission to protest? Do you permit us, if we ask for it? The home minister is passing by this way. Clear it soon. We're waiting to meet him. It's crime to protest without permission. This is the right way to meet our leaders... Elected by us who don't have free time to meet people. -Ram... -Radha, why are you here? -Please come with me. -Why did you come. Just leave. Sir! The home minister convoy is approaching. Will you leave this place or not? We are not here to leave. -We will charge at you. -Ram! We are not afraid of your batons and bullets. Hail student union. They won't listen. Remove them from here. You think you are a hero if you have some followers? You will realize things when I arrest you and put you behind bars. -Hail students union. -How dare you touch my leader? Shiva! What are you doing? Go there. Charge! Ram! -Ram! Let's go from here. -Radha, just leave this place. Shiva, take him. -Please! -Radha leave my hand. You leave from here. They are injured. -Stop it. -Please Ram! Ram! I already warned you about this. Auto! Please give him these medicines on timely basis. Thank you Radha. If you weren't there Ram would have got injured seriously. It is our responsibility to safeguard our leader. You were the only woman who came into the protest... You're not fighting for the men only, right? No problem. You can leave. I'll take care of him. But you alone can't handle... Both of us will take care of him. You can leave. Guys, let's go. Radha, don't cry. It will be alright. Ram will be fine. I'm here now. I'll take care of him. You go home. It's been late already. Go home. Parents might be worried. I'll take care. You leave. Ram will be fine. Don't cry. I'll take care of him. Radha, how is Ram? He thinks he is the likes of Tangutoori Prakasham Panthulu. 'To touch my men, first you have to touch me.' Radha, are you feeling sad about Ram? No. I'm feeling happy. How are you happy, if he is in pain? Earlier I was only Ram's friend. But now I'm his well wisher. When will you become his lover? After giving him the love letter. -Before that, I should give you a gift. -Yeah! I'll take it. I'll get down the city bus at Secunderabad station and... Take a share auto to 1983 to collect the gift. Okay? Hey, it's not funny. I want to give to you. Would you fly to 2020 and give me the gift? You're from 2020 and you're talking to me in 1983, right? Similarly, Me from 1983 can send a gift to you in 2020. Let's try? I'm here at the main entrance of the temple. This is the temple of Lord Venkateswara. God! I'm coming in. Please God! Make sure that I get that gift. Please! I should get the work done before the people start coming. This is the peepal tree. Four feet from the flagstaff. Hail Lord Hanuman! You see, Radha gave me a gift. May I have your attention please. We are here to have drinks and relax. Not to listen to your boring story. What are you drinking, sir? Scotch! -This is more powerful than Tequila. -Hey! Fresh love story. -Do you want to listen? -Love story? I'm ready. It's the story of my boyfriend Krishna and his girlfriend Radha. Can anybody guess, the age gap between Krishna and Radha? -2 years? -No! -4 years? -No! -Then it must be 10 years? -No! -So it must be 6 years. -No! The age gap between Krishna and Radha is 37 years. Damn! It's so confusing. Explain it clearly. She is in 1983... -He is in 2020. -This is impossible, madam. Krishna has invented a time machine. He travelled in that time machine and met Radha from 1983. Girl from 1983 presented a gift to the boy in 2020. -Hey!... -Now I'm opening for you. Wow! What a nice gift. How is it? -Super! -Radha and Krishna... Do you know if the Krishna you're praising, has ever gifted me anything? [in unison] How could we know? He never gave me a gift. Now I'll see his end. How dare you don't gift me anything? -But you gift to that old woman? -Please Varsha! -My dear, calm down. -I hate you. Break up! -Break up! -It's okay. Break up. How are you feeling Ram? I'm feeling uncomfortable. Is it paining? It's so hard to live like a prisoner in a room. -Was the doctor here? -He changed the bandage. -What did he say? -He said we can leave tomorrow. Great! You're cured within no time. -Vasu, you're leaving today, right? -Yes. Go on! I'll stay here. No need Radha. My hand might not be working, but my mind is working. Please call my friends. There is a lot to discuss with them. About revolutions? Revolution is not that we do in free time or when we remember it. It is a life. Revolution is my life. That's it. We shouldn't stop the people fighting for society out of our selfishness. That's true. You escaped luckily with some minor injuries. What if you were severely injured? If nothing happens to me, I'll be with the people. If anything happens to my life, I'll be in the memory of the people. Bhagat Singh, Cheguvera and Ram. Ms.Radha, your gift is amazing. Thank you so much. That idol of Radha and Krishna was my gift in a dance competition. Anyone treats the gifts preciously. But you gave it to me? Yes! The gifts are always precious. But you're more precious than that. Because of you, I'm knowing about the future. Thank you. But Krishna, no one is ready to believe that I'm talking to a person in 2020. Radha, you should help me. With that help, we can make them believe too. What's that? You have to speak with my parents. Call them online, I'll talk to them. I was eight moths old when my parents met with an accident... They have gone. But whenever the power is gone and darkness surrounds me... All my sense organs get switched off and only ears are open. Then I hear the lovely voice of my dad calling me "dear!" I hear the sound of my mother's bangles too. Krishna, don't be sad. I never felt sad that my parents aren't alive. I always hope that it would be better if they are with me. I never shared this with anyone. You're the first person. Did you think of sharing with me first? No. I thought of asking for your help. I found a photograph of my parents. My dad is from 1983-84 batch. Oh! I'm from the same batch. Even the college is same. Kalakshethram. Even you asked for evidence for your friends to believe. If you bring my father once to Ham Radio, I'll talk to him. Then my wish and your proof gets fulfilled. Good idea. Which is your fathers group? -Theatre arts Ms. Radha. -Is it? I know them all. Name? 'Kakarlapoodi Venkata Seetharama Rao.' Krishna repeat it. 'Kakarlapoodi Venkata Seetharama Rao.' 'Kakarlapoodi Venkata Seetharama Rao.' Is that you? Is he my son? Do you know my father? You're teasing me right? Why would I tease you about my parents? Is is true? Do you swear? I swear, Ms. Radha! -I'll say my mothers name... -No, don't. I know it. You know my mother? -I know her very well. -How? I know her. That's it. -Then my father? -Him too. Tomorrow evening I'll bring them here. You can talk to them. Okay? I never thought a day with such an evening would come in my life. Thank you so much Ms. Radha. Okay, dear. -Let's talk tomorrow. Take care. -Bye! We must ensure that our plan goes well. Ram! Radha, looks like you're in some hurry? I should talk to you. Okay, Take this. Sit! Sit down. Tell me. -Night I spoke on Ham Radio... -It was a mistake to give you Ham Radio. If you don't listen to my words now, it would a bigger mistake of your life. Do you know I couldn't sleep all the night after speaking to him? I was anxious to meet you and tell you about this. Talk to me about anything, except about that 2020 person. I'm talking about him and you must listen to me. Radha, you know that I don't care about unnecessary things. What's unnecessary, Ram? Knowing about your future is unnecessary? I don't think about the future. I live in the present. To live, you must be alive right? You won't live for long, Ram. Eight months after your son is born... Is this parrot astrology? Ram, it's not funny. Did you meet any astrologer? It's true, Ram. Who told you? Your son. My son? Radha, try to say something which is believable. Radha, think about it. How can my son say about this? Your son couldn't talk to you, because he was a baby. But now he wants to talk to you. Okay! How old is my son? 26? My age is 25 and my son's age is 26. Even Darwin can't explain this development. Einstein can't explain this logic. They would have died if they hear this. Ram, you're laughing me. But, you're not believing it. You're making fun of me. But I'm not feeling bad about this. All I worry is about you. You're missing a good chance, Ram. Think about it. Yes, Radha. I thought about this. I realised what I was missing. Good Irani Tea and Osmania cookies. Tea is getting cold. Can I go? This time about whom? Ram or ham? -It's about my hero. -Oh it's Ram. -No it's about ham. -What? Have you gone mad to call ham hero? Her son is a hero to a mother, right? Radha, I'm not as expressive like you. Can you explain in detail? A mother always treats her son like a great man. Got it. By the way, who's the mother and son, in this story? -Son is Krishna and his mother is... -His mother? -Yes, I'm his mother. -What? All these days I was talking to my son Krishna. Shame on you, People call it innocence when you believe in the things happening. They call you mad if you believe in the things that don't happen. Tomorrow I'll come to your home. Two things to take care of. First we should go to the hospital. You must get a check up. Next to the police station. We must file a case against him. You believed his words like a fool. We should deal with him first. Got it? Let's go home, now. I was passing by, so came to meet you. -How's your dance practice? -Going good, sir. You have to train many dancers like you in the future. Sure, sir. -Is Ham Radio working good? -Yes, sir. It's so useful to me. These days I can't stay without it. I need to update it, so I will take it once... No, sir. It's working good. It doesn't require any update. I should take a seminar in Osmania University, so I need it. -Sir, you have another one right? -But this works well. Did Ram ask you to bring it? Why would Ram ask me to? And why would I come if he ask me? I need it. Where is the radio? Sir, now I need it real bad. Dear, I need it for 2 days. Please forgive me, sir. I can't give it to you. -I gave it for your practice. -Now it is my life. Returning others things is basic manners. My need is more important than manners to me. I can't say the reason for not returning it. You won't understand it even if I explain. For you and Ram, it's just a device. But for me it is a bond. Please leave. God! I want to thank you for giving me this great opportunity. First time seeing you pray to god. Is this because you're going to talk to your parents? In my opinion all the people who are dead are God. You're so much concerned about your parents. How did you live all these years without them? Let me tell you a small logic. When their memories are fresh, we think that we can't leave without them. When those memories start to fade, we learn to live without them. My parents memories are afresh within me. How can you trust someone who says that he is your father? How would you know that he is your father? Every word from his dairy is in my heart. I can feel those vibrations. There's no chance of not recognizing him. -Is it? -Hello! -Father from 1983 and son from 2020. -Hello! Hello! -All about frequency and vibrations. -Hello! -It's all trash. -Hello! Hey no! Oh no! My parents may call any time now. Sorry! Hello! [sighs out of relief] Hello! Hello, Ms. Radha? Ms. Radha? Hello? -Dear! -Did my father come? No, your father didn't believe me. I expected this. Please try to convince him. I'll do it. I'll bring him once he gets convinced. Damn! I was so eager to talk to my dad. You can talk to your mother instead. What? Did my mother come? Think she is here. What will you say to her? Please Ms. Radha, let me talk to my mother. I'll, but first tell me about what you are going to talk? No. You're lying. Krishna, mother's don't lie. Okay. First I'll ask about my grandmother. About what? I'll say that I appreciate my grandmother. But why? Because she named my mother with a beautiful name 'Vasudha.' What? Because she named my mother with a beautiful name 'Vasudha.' -Vasu. -Hi, what's up? -Radha! -Hello, Vasudha. Vasudha, the guy in the centre is Ram. -Vasudha? -Yes! Vasudha means earth, right? I should appreciate my grandmother for sure. Please let me talk to my mother? -Vasu... -Ms. Radha, hello? Please let me talk to my mother? Ms. Radha, hello? Vasu? Vasu? But how? -Can't be. -Hello, Ms. Radha? How could it be? Sir! -Tell me. -I came to return this Ham Radio. -It was useful to me then. -It's not useful to me now. Did you get me wrong that I came asking for it? No, sir. I realised that it's a mistake. Why would you make a mistake? Getting attached to things which aren't our's is a mistake. Hey Radha! -Why are you late? -Caught with some work. -When did you come, Vasudha? -Just a while ago. I thought I could meet you in college. Ram met me and you were late. I'm always late. I'm not as fast as you. There's nothing special with us. Me and Vasudha are just commoners. From Hyderabad and Janagaon. But you are living in 1983 and doing friendship with a guy from 2020. That's why you both teamed up? Both of us want to teach you a lesson. As you both teamed up, I learnt my lesson. -Looking so dull today? -No, I'm fine. Even I never saw you like this before? You never saw me to know, how I am and for whom I was living. Is that Ham Radio guy troubling you? No! Is he talking to you in the same timing every day? You need to give some basic info to file a complaint in the police station. Where are you going? I came for you and you're going to class? I should go. You have Ram's company. Radha, when do we go to police station? No, Ram. No one is talking to me on the ham radio. I was just lying all the time. "Where is the destiny of your heart now?" "Is your silence questioning you?" "Is this separation killing you?" "Your dreams are shattered this second." "All these days remain as memories." "The eyes are filled with tears." "This is Gods game" "Don't know who the winner is?" "This is Gods game" "Don't know who the winner is?" Hello, Ms.Radha? Please talk to me once. "You got to know the relations between people?" "Is your heart rising like a wave of the sea?" "Something is brewing in your heart." "And the story took a turn." "All these days remain as memories." "The eyes are filled with tears." "This is Gods game" "Don't know who the winner is?" "This is Gods game" "Don't know who the winner is?" Hello, Ms.Radha? Hello, Ms. Radha? Ms. Radha...? Please let me talk to my parents once. Hello, Radha? Please! "The hearts of these people..." "Remain as answered questions." "This is the magic of time" " Is this is the destiny of love?" "All these days remain as memories." "The eyes are filled with tears." "This is Gods game" "Don't know who the winner is?" "This is Gods game" "Don't know who the winner is?" I understood that I can't change the future even after knowing it. My fate tell's me that Ram is not mine Vasudha is so lucky Uniting them is my fate Don't know why Ms. Radha is not connecting with me. My fathers belongings are in the out house. I may get some clue if I search them. Yes, let's give a try. 'MOTHER' To Kakarlapoodi Venkata Seetharama Rao, from Dr. Jaya Shankar. Is that Prof. Jaya Shankar sir? 'Dear Ram, life is all about going ahead in the path we chose.' 'You knew that you chose the toughest path.' 'A person like you, who believes that ideals are greater than life...' 'I can't say anything except all the best.' We didn't understand Radha in the way... We understood the technology and the world. One day Radha returned me the ham radio. A call was connected on the same night. That call was from future. 'That call was from future.' -Hello! -Sir, is Radha there? -Who are you? -Sir, my name is Krishna. -Sir and you? -I'm Radha's lecturer. Prof. Jaya Shankar. Sir, where is Ms. Radha? Why are you asking about Radha? Sir, Radha promised that she would let me talk to my parents. -You called for your parents? -Yes, sir! You won't believe my words. But, I'm calling from 2020. -2020? -Yes, sir. From the past few days, I was talking to Ms. Radha. My father is a student of your college, sir. His name is Kakarlapoodi Venkata Seetharama Rao. Sir, I want to speak to my parents at least once. Sir, you please make it happen for at least once. Okay. I'll arrange it. I can become popular, by informing this news to media. A guy from future is trying to connect with past. I saw his struggle to meet his parents and I felt it as a human. So, I gave back the ham radio to Radha. I'm writing to you because I regret about something. I observed that Radha is keeping away from you after this happened. Did Ms. Radha loose my dad because of me? Ms. Radha lost everything because of me. Somehow I should connect with her and apologise to her. Would be great if I could connect with her today. I should apologise her. Hello Ms.Radha! You lost so much because of me, I know that. I'm really sorry. Please forgive me. I can't bare this pain. I'm really sorry. Ms. Radha, please show some pity on this orphan. Please make my parents talk to me. Please! Ms. Radha? Ms. Radha, Please take my call. Hello Radha! Please! Talk to me once. Ms. Radha? Radha isn't here. -You? -I'm her classmate. Sir, please ask her to speak to me. I'll call tomorrow. Ask her to answer my call. -What's your name? -I'm Krishna, sir. -Is that your full name? -No, sir. Kakarlapoodi Venkata Krishna Mohan. -Sir, can you help me? -Tell me. If Radha is your classmate, you would know my father too. Sir, can you bring my father to this ham radio, tomorrow? Your father's full name? Kakarlapoodi Venkata Seetharama Rao. He won't trust you. Tell him that I'm the grandson of Kakarlapoodi Venkata Poorna Chandrayya. Tell me him that I'm the successor of the old house he played... and to the Neem tree on which he swung in Vikarabad. He read Maxim Gorky's 'Mother', Toll Stoy's 'War and peace' Cheguvera's bio graphy etc. Tell him that I'm the unlucky guy who treasured his books as assets. You still don't believe me? Letters he got from Puchapalli Sundaraiah and Kondapalli Seetharamaiah garu, Tell him, I grew up reading those letters though I couldn't understand them. They started the Ham Radio club not to use in case of natural calamities. That was... [voice muted] Remind him that this is an arrangement between him and Prof. Jayashankar. [voice muted] Remind him that I read this in his diary. Sir, are you hearing me? I didn't believe this when Radha told me. But I can't disagree with you either. Kakarlapoodi Venkata Seetharama Rao alias Ram. I'm the one. Don't call me sir. Call me dad. Dad! How are you, Krishna? Krishna! Krishna... Stop crying. I'm a leader in my generation. I hope you're a leader too in your generation. A leader must always hide his emotions. Be it love or tears, they shouldn't be visible to others. What did you study, Krishna? -I pursued Engineering, dad. -What are you doing? I'm working as a software engineer, dad. I can feel the loss of my absence. If I were there I wouldn't have let this to happen. What did you study means what literature did you study? What are doing you means, what are you doing for society? Don't worry. At least plan now. Okay, dad. Is mom with you, dad? -Krishna! -Mom! I don't know why, but that word is hurting me. How are you, my son? I look like dad, even I grew a beard. Grandfather used to say that you left everyone for dad. How is your grandfather? Both grand parents passed away. Are you living alone? I got used to it. It's your blood which taught me to fight in life. I'm winning in every situation of life. But I wish you both were there with me. Krishna, parents don't stay forever. Try to find a person who shares your happiness, A book which makes you forget your worries, Try to find a friend who consoles you when you're hurt. Sure, dad. I'll speak to you every time when I'm down emotionally. No, Krishna. The steps towards our future always result in progress. The steps towards our past always result in regress. We're not living to regress in life. Be a leader for your generation and be like a bridge to the next generation. Krishna, truth always prevails and trust always keeps you going. Believe that I'm alive and I'm with you. Progress in life. You're laying a strong foundation for your career. They shouldn't become weak with our presence. Think that we never met, and nothing but imagination. All the best! It's okay. It's okay, Krish. I fulfilled my responsibility. I have united father and son. I'll live my rest of the life in the contemplation of Lord Rama... And memories of this Ram. TODAY "You got to know the relations between people?" "Is your heart rising like an wave of sea?" "Something is brewing in your heart." "And the story took a turn." "All these days remain as memories." "The eyes are filled with tears." "This is God's game" "Don't know who the winner is?" "This is God's game" "Don't know who the winner is?" To live with person who is filled in heart, is marriage compulsory? Aren't memories enough? With love... Your Suresh. -Sir! -Yes, brother. Some chacha here? Which chacha? Raheem chacha. There are so many people with the name of Raheem. He makes sweets with coconuts. -Oh! The elder one? -Yes. There he is. -Greetings, uncle. -Greetings. Tell me dear. Before 35 years, a girl used to come to you to buy your coconut sweet. I don't remember. She used to bring lemon rice for you. Yes, you're right. -Chacha! -Come, my dear Radha. This is your return gift. I want two kilograms of your coconut sweet. What for dear? -Raheem chacha. It's my birthday. -Is it? My friends should taste your sweet today. -Blessings on your birthday. -Thank you. Whenever they make lemon rice in their house... She used to get it for me. KALA KSHETRAM Krishna! Radha studied in this collage, right? We may get her details if we contact the principal. -Sir, I need some information. -No information. There was a girl named Radha from the 1983 batch. How are you related to her? -She is my mother's friend. -So? His father's name is Kakarlapoodi Venkata Seetharama Rao. -Are you Ram's son? -Yes, sir. I don't know about the students who are from batch of 1983. Recently their reunion meeting was held. But a person named Raju is working as theatre arts lectures in this collage. You may get some useful information if you meet him. Okay? [voices muted] Coconut... Krishna? -How are you, Krishna? -You? I'm fine. -Varsha, right? -Yes. -You still remember her? -Yes. -How are you, dear? -Good, aunty. You came searching for me. Thanks, Krishna. I can see a smile on your lips, but I can't see happiness in your eyes. Only apologies aren't enough for the loss you suffered because of me. What mistake? Because of me, you left my father and missed him. If you had not told me, I would have missed the life. Krishna, life gives us a lot. We must accept it. We shouldn't blame it. Hope you don't get hurt if we discuss old topics. Be it the waves and the disturbance, they trouble us the in the beginning. Once you get deep into the ocean, it's pure silence. You felt sad for not being my father's wife, right? A wife should support the thoughts and ideology of her husband. But she shouldn't be a hurdle to him. May be Ram didn't like that. You said it so simply. It might sound simple to you. But... It took 30 years to realise this philosophy. Then why didn't you think about getting married? My love for Ram isn't a line made by pencil to erase it. It's a tattoo. We can't remove it. No, aunty. You should come with us. You should stay with Krishna. I'll do that when I'm not comfortable here. Okay. Take care. -Take care. -Do you have a class, now? Yes, dear. -I'll visit you again. -Don't. When you visit me regularly, I become a slave of waiting. The heart which feels so happy while forming relations, Won't be ready to take the pain when those relations break up. "The hearts of these people..." "Remained as questions without answers." "This is the magic of the time." " Is this is the destiny of love?" "All these days remain as memories." "The eyes are filled with tears." "This is God's game" "Don't know who the winner is?" "This is God's game" "Don't know who the winner is?"
