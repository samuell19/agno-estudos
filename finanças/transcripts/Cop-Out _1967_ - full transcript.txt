His strong. Never we. Now, we don't mind if you call. You at it again, Pete. You stick that you want to drag. I got my own private factory of stimulants. Desmond Flowers own brand. Up here. They? Love is. All we have to give. All we want to do is live. Anything you want to do is fine. Don't forget I promised you for tomorrow. 50. Not a penny less. It's okay, darling. I'll get it for you. You're sure you can? I'll have to. Angie, you're not asking your father. Him? But. Went to Southampton last night. Well. Mhm. Desmond's got a new boat. Is he? Don't you ever want to know what I do with my life? I'm not the inquisitive kind. I suppose. You know, I feel pretty sure that if I were ever in any trouble. I wouldn't come to you for help. I don't suppose you would sensibly go to your employer. That bright hope of the bar. Smart. Alec Chisholm. You're right. And his name is Chetan. Mr. Chetan. I'm sorry, Mr. Cheetham. Come on, Doug. You know, I remember him when he was the office boy in our chambers. A revolting little tick. Is that all day in the courtroom, reading comics and dreaming up new ways to pilfer tuppence from the petty cash. So he's a barrister now? Oh, come on. You know perfectly well he's a barrister. Well, imagine that. Well, at least he works for his living. Ah. He works for his living. It's a very good defense. It has the virtue of being equally valid for cat burglars, forgers, embezzlers. Safe blowers. But don't worry about your Mr. Cheatham. He'll. He'll go far. He's got all it takes now to get to the very tippy top. I must get back to my room. You're drunk again. Yes, my darling daughter again, as you say, like yesterday. Day before tomorrow. Okay. After. Don't forget to turn the light off. Why do you hate me? You don't give a damn about me, do you? You don't give a damn about me. But you're never here, are you? It was off to London or Bristol or somewhere. And you never here with me. It's my work, darling. You seem to forget that. But I'm your wife. You seem to forget that. No, I don't. I love you, Diana. You know that. Love. Is that what you call it? Yes, that's what I call it. Love. It's love. It's a funny thing. In court, I've never been at a loss for words when it comes to explaining my own feelings. I can't do it. Or I'm bored. Bored stiff. Can't you understand that? One of these days when you come home. I won't be here. See, you've always been free to do exactly what you like, Diana. It's all the same to you. Is that it? My feelings don't come into it. They won't affect you one way or another. You always made that quite plain. But there is someone else to consider. Who? Angela. What are you worried about her for? I can't help it. She's my child, too. How do you know? Hey. I've tidied up the room. It's about time, huh? Hey. You do look alike, huh? Your mother in you. I've never noticed it before. She's much prettier. It's the only photo of her I've got. My father burned all the others after she ran away from him. Lucky he never comes in here. Not anywhere else in the house. You know, this place is becoming more and more like a railway station. Peter, Sir Desmond. They all come and go as they please. So what? He's bound to stumble upon one of us sooner or later. Oh, not in a million years. He's stuck in there. Doesn't let anyone come in. Not even the Daily. Doesn't care what goes on outside. What about your mother? Does he still care about her? I told you, he doesn't care about anyone or anything. We're going to pieces, aren't we, my beautiful. Sorry, Mr. Chatham. What's worrying you? Nothing. Come on. There is something. Is it your old man? Yes. I wish I had the guts to leave him. Such a phony. Come. Come. It's true. Everything about him is phony. Even his limp. Slipped in a drunken stupor and carries on as if he were a war hero. You must be fair to the poor devil. Once upon a time, he was someone. Look, these are all his cases. Murders and all that. Want to have a look at them sometime? No, thank you. I must say, a touch of hanging gave an interest to the law. Then that's what we want. A good crime, do we? Treason, murder, rape. I'm sick of all this puny stuff, Angela. Couldn't you get abducted or something? What? In Winchester? Nothing ever happens in Winchester. You always try Southampton. I give you the fare for the ticket. You'd have to. I'm broke. What again? Yes. As a matter of fact, I was going to ask you for another advance. I hope you don't mind. I don't know what you do with your money. Mr. Sawyer. Did you enjoy them? I'll let you in on a little secret, Sue. I never read them. Well. Well, isn't it, Mr. Sawyer? I'm sorry. What? I used to brief you, sir, when I was at Hinds and Jackson's. Don't you remember me? I'm retired now. Alone? Nothing to do but to think of the good old days. It's very sad when nobody remembers you so silly. Of course I remember you. The Sandhurst murder case. That wretched little man who shot his wife's lover. You were standing directly behind Pat Jackson when he came up to me. You were in such a state, sir. I hardly thought you'd notice me. Came up to me, and he tried to persuade me not to go on with the defence. Why risk a man's life? He said, when any Tom, Dick, or Harry could get him off. And I was making such a hash of it, but I went on. And they hanged him. Thanks to me, they hanged. The poor little beggar. On the day of the execution. I was there to see justice done. I should have said members of the jury. This man was betrayed by the woman he loved. A mischance that could have happened to any one of us. Imagine then, your present feelings. If such a thing had happened to you. I don't have to strain my imagination because it happened to me yesterday. It's a matter of fact. Well, then members of the jury looking at it from this point of view, can a man, an ordinary man, be blamed for picking up his? Old army revolver and firing into the man who had destroyed his life. Hey. What's happened? We've had a visitor, my dear. Not for me, of course. I'm not that popular. Who is he? Mhm. Someone had better do something. Someone who isn't befuddled. I know Young Cheatham is our glory. Front page of the Express. That's all he wants from life. Big chance for me too. I can have my bit of fun. Gentlemen. My daily work as. Chief Constable makes me realise more and more that what the world lacks today is discipline. Discipline of the kind some of us learnt in the Army. And I feel certain that the bar here. Is that brother of yours? So, John, what on earth are you telephoning about? Please, I'm rehearsing my speech. What discipline of the kind. Some of us learnt in the army. Darling, please be quiet. I can't hear a word he's saying. You've got a what? In your attic. Was she talking to. Your Uncle John? Hang on a minute. I think he's drunk. He says, Are you still interested in dead bodies? I mean, I don't mind if you aren't really no concern of mine. I'll just put him out with the empties. Now. I can't imagine. Just a visitor, I suppose. Someone who just happened to drop in. You're coming around. My dear Chief Constable. That will be an honour. Don't say a word, Angela. There's no need to say anything at all. I feel sure Miss Sawyer wishes to help us in every way. As Miss Sawyer's representative, I am bound to warn her that. Totally there it. Right. Our guest is leaving us. I think this calls for a drop of whisky all around. Be quiet. Man. This is a serious business. It's probably very serious for you, but to me, it comes as the climax of a long, drawn out farce. Inspector? Yes, sir. Don't expect her to open her heart to you that much. I have learned about this young lady. She has no heart. Or if she has, it doesn't open. Please, Mr. Sawyer, just let me handle this one. Yes, of course, Mr. Cheatham. Yes. Yes. Carry on, Cheatham. I think I ought to tell you how Barney got here. I don't think I can help you anymore. But if you need me, just wake me. But do it gently, because I'm a very delicate piece of machinery. You see, Desmond has this boat in Southampton, and we go there from time to time. There's not really much to do here, you know. Nowhere to go. You stick to your team because we've got our own. Love is all we have to give. And all we want to do is live. Anything you want to do is fine. Might even want to blow your mind. Hi. Come on. Yay! Come there. All right. Here. We're up. Ha ha ha ha. Putting in lifeboats the principal sport on a liner. Wow. Hey. It looks like a spaceship. No, no, no. This is one of those places where they turn out those beautiful waltzes. La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la da la da da da. What's happening? We turn these taps. It's stuck. Let's get out of here. Come on. No good kiddies. Shut up. Steal that. I'd say you were all a lot of trouble. We haven't done anything wrong. Sure you haven't. You just got lost on your way to a Christian science reading room. Ain't that so? Well, if you're smart, you'll stop thinking and start thinking fast, because you're gonna have to explain something to the cops. Like breaking and entering. I wonder what they give you for that. That's a nice watch. You know, I. I don't have to call the cops. I mean, if we got to know each other a little better. I wouldn't rat on my friends. Ain't that so? Name's Bonnie. Bonnie Thiel. America. And despite the fact that I'm surrounded by a lot of water. I'm pretty thirsty. Put your English licensing. Oh, that's. Murder. Don't worry. You got a place of our own that never closes. Once upon a time, all this was floating in a mist of cigar smoke and enticing perfumes. And any minute now, Pete's greedy old man's going to pull it down to sell fish fingers and deodorants. Come again? What he means is my father's bought this site for a new branch. Of the stores. He's got all these stores, you see. Oh, the biggest around here with the highest reputation and the lowest pay packet. Shut up. I get it, kiddies. Choose your parents well. And you're set for life, huh? I that so? There's nothing to it, really. This old place has been rotting for years. Ever since it couldn't pay its way as a cinema. Doesn't even good enough to be a warehouse. Look. What do you think of Old Pete's Heirloom? You want the God's honest truth. Well, now that I've seen your haven, it crosses my mind that I'd like to spend a few days here in peace and quiet. Huh? See there are those aboard that float cathouse who, well, they're not exactly sympathetic. Now, I won't be rushing out to see you again. Desmond, my dear. I'm going to stay here for a few days and get me a little rest. Where the rent is most likely to be minimal. Do you want to stay here in the old Alhambra? It's a bit drafty. Well, I've slept in drafty places. Central Park once with the gates open. Yes, but this place stinks. But I like it that way. Now. It will have to be furnished up a little bit, huh? But we'll take advantage of our good friend and benefactors stores. Barney settled in the cinema and there one night. It's no use. I can't move. Oh. We'll get a doctor. No, no, nothing like that. Where I am is not for publication. Well, you can't stay here. They'll throw me in irons. Ship. But. You'll help Barney out, won't you? We couldn't just leave him there. All hurt and everything. So we thought of bringing him here. I mean, it seemed natural at the time. We all wander in and out of this house, and my father isn't inclined to notice things. And tonight, what happened tonight, Miss Sawyer? They can't make you answer tonight. I'm afraid I just can't help you about that. Did they torture you long? Only till about midnight when I rang you. You're shivering. You're not ill, are you? I'm all right. Joe. Tell me the truth. Was it you? What makes you think so? Well, I was waiting for you when it all happened. And what if it was me? Would you give me up? Never. I did not kill Barney. But why the hell are you crying? Because I'm happy. All this will be yours one day. And what do you do? Get mixed up with corpses in attics. You the son of a magistrate? I am sorry. The whole story looked damn well in the Hampshire Chronicle, didn't it? What? The papers are papers. Mold the mind of the nation. Don't just stand there. Get over there, will you? Wait till the stores open. You'll see how all the customers will gape at us. But why? Because of the power of the printed word. I've told you. I'm sorry. Yes. Not that you weren't misled, I grant you that. But are those I'm blaming even more than you? My old man wants to see you right away. Yeah, I thought he would. So I'll take over for a bit. And don't take it to heart whatever happens. This has been a great shock to us all. It was an opportunity for you here, Christoforides. A real opportunity of going up and up in life. Like me, I began low, very low. But I made my own way up. And I'm proud of it. But you disappointed me, Christoforidis. You've really disappointed me. My son treated you as one of the family. You let him down, Christoforides. You really let him down. And for that, there is no forgiveness. Hazel said his cards on after, will you? And the holiday money as usual. He won't be in tomorrow. Pompous ass. Isn't that one of the hipster skirts from our teenage boutique? That's right, Mr. Hawkins. How terribly clever of you to. I don't think he's the right size for you. Let me see. Better get rid of it. How did it get there? I don't know. We'll find out later. I'll have a word with the old man. Try to get you your job back. Thanks, Pete. I don't know what to do to thank you. Don't worry. You'll have plenty of chances. Must rush now. I'll see you. Oh, thank you. Joe. Joe. You won't be late for work. I'm not going. You are not ill, Joe. All right. I'll take the day off, that's all. Take the day off. But what will they say at the store? Don't worry, I'll tell them. My father. Toothache. You should not tell all those lies, Joe. One day they will find you out. And then you will get the sack. So what if they do? I'll soon find another job. Now see what you make me do. I'm sorry, Mother. Does it hurt? No. What hurts me is you, Joe. The things you do, the lies you tell. Not again, Mother. Look, Mother, if anything ever happened to me, what can happen? Everyone here knows you are a good boy, Joe. No, Mother, you don't understand. You've never understood. What is the matter? Are you in any sort of trouble? Perhaps. I have always told you not to hang around with that crowd. They are not your sort. Stick to your own people. Stop it, Mother. This is Christopher Riley. I'll go home. You get on with your work, Mrs. Mop. How about not intruding on your privacy, Mr. Sawyer? No, no, certainly not. Come in. I'd just like to have another look around on a case of this nature. It helps to be on the scene to soak up the atmosphere. I see. Are you working on a case, then? Well, you should know about that, Mr. Sawyer. Oh, yes. My unfortunate visitor. You know, I hope this isn't going to become a house where middle aged men come to die. Elephants, you know, will travel for hundreds of miles. To die under the right tree is very disturbing for me. If herds of doomed ship stewards from all quarters of the globe start converging on my attic, I wouldn't like that. Have you. Seen the morning paper. Morning paper is something that I never see. It says that an early arrest is expected. Well, we've made it. It's a local boy. One Christopher Eads. Should I know him? Christopher Eads. Sorry, It doesn't ring a bell. It's an open and shut case. He tried to hide the murder weapon, but we found it. That's very clever of you. How did you do that? Well, we received information. Has he admitted committing the murder? No, but he's made a statement. Here it is. If you'd like to see it. Public lavatory. What do you know about this boy? Nothing very much Cypriot family. Mother works as some dry cleaners. Father died a few years back. It was said we shouldn't allow these foreign immigrants to come here. Nothing but trouble. A foreigner. That's why you're all against him, isn't it? I've an egg. What's that rotten world of yours? Killing off everyone that doesn't fit into it. Eggs, bacon and whisky. That's all I had to 20 murder trials. And they hanged them in those days. Eat something. Oh, I feel sick. And I think that Joe's in prison. Nasty places. Prison. I bring out the worst in you. Wouldn't be feeling sorry for Joe by any chance? No. Can't say that I am. I'm sure you'll find somebody who will be. You're Mr. Cheatham, Perhaps. I tried to see it my way. Please, Angela. I do anything to help you. But you mustn't ask the impossible. Why is it so impossible? Surely you understand. I simply can't afford to make enemies. The most important people in town. The age of the Crusades is over. This darling, is the age of lobster thermidor, supreme elegance. And I'm not going to be left behind if I can help it. So you're not going to take on Joe's case, is that it? Certainly not to defend him. I'm not plotting my book. Oh, no, not me. We should prosecute him, wouldn't you? I know that would be something. Yes, I'm sure it would keep you in lobster thermidor for the rest of your days. I've spoken to Chetan. Oh, well. Oh, he's like the rest. Not look. Uh, about Joe. I thought of something. You and what could you have thought of? If I shot a strange steward in the middle of the night in a strange house. If you did. Then what? Well, I don't think that I'd take the gun I stole to do it with to work next day. Keep it in my locker, just for the pleasure of dropping it into the system of a very public public lavatory. Yeah, I don't think I'd do that. Exactly. You're right, you know. But why didn't someone point that out? Oh, well, they'd probably have held him in custody anyway. I saved a lot of embarrassment. What? What would you say if. First. If I asked you to defend Joe. Why me? I've no one else to turn to. I love Joe. He's a killer. He is not. Well, the facts are all against him. You'll admit that, won't you? Yes. And you still say you didn't do it? He didn't. Well, I submit that what you're telling me is a pack of lies and that you're deliberately trying to shield a criminal. He's innocent. I know it. Well, sure, I did. It doesn't really matter. Oh, no, of course it doesn't. To you, he's just someone your daughter is in love with, that's all. And you don't care? No, I don't. You still want me to take the case? Oh, I don't know. I don't know anything anymore. You're all against him just because he's different. Just because he's out of step with you. But I love him. I love him more than anything else in the whole world. But that's beyond you, isn't it? You don't know what I'm talking about. You've never loved. It's around. Oh. I don't know why I asked you to take on this case. I should have known that you wouldn't. Oh, but I am taking it on. You are. Ha, ha. Why? Because I know what it's like to be out of step. I want to go in there. Do you mind? If you go on trial, Christopher reads, It won't be for your morals. Nobody cares what you get up to. You are my tender hearted daughter. She's old enough now to waste her time any way she pleases. You were there that night, weren't you? When? Oh, come on. The night of the incident. I saw you run out of the house like a rabbit with a ferret after it. No. Where are you or where are you? Not in my house that night. Yes. Lying is a great art, Christopher reads. It requires years of training and a variety of schools, among which unquestionably the most effective is marriage. Complete mastery of the art comes only with age. So a person of your inexperience is well advised to stick to the truth. Now, would you be good enough to tell me how the gun came into your possession? Well, Barney was always thinking up new games. They seem sort of comic at the time. What a healthy man who can't live alone. Ain't that so? Where on earth did you find her? She was hanging around the back. But you know something? Plenty more where she came from. Peach toss. Only you don't want to brighten up Barney's lonely life. I'll get you anything you need. And it isn't that easy. That easy? It is dead easy. Just got to know how. Lots of ways to get a lot of things. If you've got the brains. And the guts, that's all. Lot. Try again. Hey, what do you think you're doing? Just wanted to see if you were cheating. Come on out. The things that girls would do for this dust. Enough to send them to perdition. Shut up! Get out. Here you are, darling. Something to cuddle. Hey, that lady from the Wild West Show. She wasn't kidding. This is the real McCoy. It's a little rusty. But I bet if you if you massage some good rubbing oil on it. I will loosen it up. Wouldn't it? Hey. Well done. Christopher. Edis. You put your hands on a regular firearm. Theft with intent to kill. Oh, you're in for a long stretch, mate. Why? I haven't committed any crime. That's right. He hasn't. And you know why? Because there's no such thing as crime. I mean, not in nature, anyway. Nature kills all the time. And that's all. And that that. You're happy to know. You met Angela just the same. Neither of you would say a word if you didn't have to. Can't imagine what you do when you're alone together. We talk. But to be quite fair, Angela does most of the talking. You. You can't stop her once she gets going. She never opens her mouth. Not with you. Why not? I wonder. Because. Yes, go on. Because she thinks you hate her. I can't blame her. But it can't be true. Why not? Because if you hated her, you wouldn't be here now. I'm here to get the truth out of you. If you have the guts to tell me. Right. I'd better tell you all about the accident, then. The accident? You mean that the gun dropped into your hands and went off by spontaneous combustion? No, not then. I mean, when Barney had his first accident. All right, let's hear about Barney's first accident. Hey, what's going on? Final touch in the education Uncle Barney's giving you. But I've been let down. I've been very badly let down. But you weren't here. You would have enjoyed it. But then. There ain't nothing that you and that bird of yours don't know. Huh? Yeah. What are you talking about? You and Angela. Leave Angela out of it, you slut. You're a fighter then, huh? You fancy yourself a boxer, Joe? Now. Me, Me. I don't know nothing about boxing. I done some wrestling. Yeah. Professional even. Four scissors have buttocks roll. Body slam to. Hey, you know what I played? I mean, in wrestling, But you got to have a good guy and a bad guy. Ain't that so? Guess what I played. I play the devil. God love to hate. Nah, shut. Up. Want me to shut up? Hey, you know what some nasty people around here say? He said to Joe the Greek. That's you, huh? He'll do anything for hard cash. Ain't that so? Know what else they say. They say with that pretty face is he can get any girl he wants, but I don't think so. Know what I think? Shut up, will you? I think you're nothing at all. I think you are a beginner. Now if Angela were my girl. Oh. Oh. Could I show her something? I mean, I could complete her education in more ways than one. I told you to shut up. Didn't you hear me? I heard you. Oh, easy, Greek. I ain't gonna break nothing off here. Just give you a lesson in what it is to have good manners. God. Hey, hey, Hey. You kissed my girlfriend, huh? Go ahead. Kiss her on the lips and I'll let you go unharmed. Now, she may be a little cold, but you won't mind that. Go ahead, Greek. It was good, Kitty. That's real good. That's a man's game. So why don't you try it again? Come on. And the. Weak link. He licked the mud. Now, I don't know if that's in the Good book, but if it ain't, it sure should be. Ha! I'm going to punish you. I'm going to punish the lot of you. Especially you. Even Greek. What are we going to do now? I think what you're going to do. You're gonna find me a decent place to stay. If I stop talking. Oh, you'll be in some trouble. You're going to give me plenty of food and drink. Lots of drink. I'm going to need some money. Of course. So money, of course. Of course. Your brand. Great. Fantastic. Marvelous. Marvelous. That's it, baby. Hold that one. Great. Marvelous. No, don't move. Don't move. Beautiful. Super, baby. Super. Say, do you mind, sir? I'm trying to get on with my work. You're in shot. Thank you. That's it, baby. Hold it. Super, super love. Hold it. Great. Marvelous. Do you mind? I'm trying to work. I'm so sorry. Thank you. That's it, baby. Hold it. Super, super. Great. Glad to meet you, sir. Got news for you as it happens. The motive for the murder. We've got it cut and dried. Marvelous. Marvelous. Young Christopher Edis was sending money orders to Teel's wife. Arrears of maintenance. A clear case of blackmail. That's it, baby. Hold that one. Great. Marvelous. No, don't move. Don't move. Beautiful supervising, sir. No. In the country, my dear fellow. I hadn't been listening to anyone for 16 years, but now I find myself listening to all and sundry very disappointing. All right, you're saying. No doubt. Our friend Barney Thiel knew about Christopher Eady's drug taking and put the screws on drugs. You knew about that, Of course. Mainly Peter Hawkins, to be fair. But Christopher Eady's must have been true, no doubt. Hence the blackmail. Refers Kief. Cannabis. Hemp. You call that drugs? Well, the North Africans take it for afternoon tea, the spoonfuls of jam. Fortunately, the magistrates are North Africans. No, they're just local plutocrats, drugged with cigarettes and television serials. Right. Nice meeting you. Nice meeting you, sir. Good morning. John. What on earth are you doing here? Too romantic for the likes of me. Is that it? John, you really ought to find something to do. Occupy your mind. What about golf? Golf? You think I'm glad I met you, Mr. Sawyer? In fact, I meant to come and see you. Oh, what for? To tell you that quite by chance, I'll be prosecuting in the Christoforides case. Quite by chance. Well, let's say that I have my own ways of tempting chance. Chance is not the only thing, by the looks of it, John. I think you're on to something. Sex. That's what I ought to be taking up in my middle age. Have you been getting much of it? Please, John, I don't mean the colonel, of course, because he has too many responsibilities. But from some other source, perhaps. He looks fit. I'll deal with him one of these days. Don't take any notice of him, darling. He's such a pathetic creature. I have done my best, sir. I still do. But it is no use. He has got these ideas, you see. Ideas are always dangerous. Three years at art school, none of it has done him any good, it seems. Of course he will not listen to me now. What would you tell him? What is that? What would you tell him if he did? Listen. I would tell him that it is not. All milk and honey. That is all. It is not all milk and honey. And profound truth is no doubt finding out himself. But one thing I can tell you, sir, he is very much in love with your girl. If you do not mind me saying so very much. How do you know he doesn't confide in you? Surely they both do. Both him and Angela any time she comes here. But then you can see for yourself. See what? How they feel when they took you away. I found this. Why ask all these questions? Night soon. See you tomorrow. Good night. The policeman asked me everything I told him. Who actually slept with whom? How should I know? What about you? Who with? For God's sake. Desmond Desmond's frightfully handsome, Of course, but. But what? You know why people go on liners. They put up with all the sick, fancy dress balls and ping pong on the poop for just one thing. Sex. Right. Dinner at the captain's table, then down here and at it. Right the way round the bloody world. Beginning in Southampton. I thought so. Big mouth. No, not Desmond. I was only trying to find him out. Not anyone, really. And now I must go. Mr. Sawyer, or I'll be late. I see. Well, don't sound so disapproving. We can't all be the way you people imagine us. Aren't they fun? Uncle John Desmond. Opium for the masses used to be religion. Now it's sex. Surely you didn't come all the way down to Southampton to admire those masterpieces? No. I came for the fresh air. What a lovely coat. Our friend Joe. Do you imagine that that was his style of reading material? Oh, no, no, no, of course not. Poor old Joe. But I bet you get him off. You've got quite a few murders off in your time, haven't you? Do you think he's a murderer? Oh, good God, no. No, He just went off the rails a bit. Poor old chap. After all, he's a foreigner. And let's face it, they are different from us. They're wild. Whiskey, Uncle John. Oh, silly of me to ask, really, isn't it? A large whiskey for my uncle and a great big vodka tonic for me. Betty, darling, you were saying all about Joe. He's wild. Of course, we all know that. But then the late Barney Teale wasn't exactly a choirboy, was he? He must have driven poor Joe raving mad. Why? Well, Barney was. It was what? He was the scum of the earth. But he did pull in the birds. I think Angela rather fancied him in a horrible sort of way. Of course. You think so? Well, we don't know what went on in your attic, do we? Oh, thank you so much. Oh, never mind. Oh, look at the time. Never keep a lady waiting, as you have said in your heyday. Uncle John. Excuse me. Cheerio, Betty. So long, Brenda. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Oh, that's his change. Oh, well, you better keep it here. Oh, thanks. Sorry I've been so long. That's all right. It's the first time I've ever ironed a man's coat. It smells of you. I know. I had to empty my perfume bottle on it. You have no idea what 15 years. Nothing can do to a piece of cloth. Nothing to what it does to a man. Well, now we have something in common. Is that all? All what all we have in common. I'm not much use to you, Angela. I mean, we're worlds apart. We always have been. Only because you wanted it. Good luck. Thank you. The court will rise. I think I should say that the defendant is personally known to me. Is there any objection to my remaining on the bench? These are merely committal proceedings. There can be no possible objection. We can take it that the defense, too, welcomes you remaining on the bench, sir. Shouldn't you object, sir? At a preliminary hearing, one idiot is as good as another. You may call your first witness, Mr. Cheatham. Detective Inspector called her. But no one has yet arrived to take over the shop. And I must leave. Please, Mr. Greenwood, send someone quick, please. Yeah, that's the one. You're sure? Quite sure. Of course I am. I know a delinquent when I see one. No questions. As you like, Mr.. Call your next witness. Angela Sawyer. Angela Sawyer. Good luck. No. Take the book in your right hand and read the words on the card. All that oath business is sheer nonsense. Oh, it might have been something once upon a time when people went to confession and believed in the Holy Ghost. But today, still, it does make you think twice and you never know. Are you? Angela? Madeline Sawyer of Clifton Terrace. Winchester? Yes. Poor woman. Pull yourself together, mate, and don't start fluffing when you see your honourable father perched on the bench. Of course I went and stick to the line. We all liked Joe. He wasn't one of us, but we liked him. And if they hadn't nicked him, I'd have asked him to. My party tonight. We always did ask him. We wanted to give him a chance. That's it. You say? Just that. I will. I've learned it all by heart. Then you've got nothing to worry about, have you? Come on, give me a light. Do you recognize this gun? I think so. Did you ever see the gun in the defendant's hand? Yes, but he didn't keep it. I know he didn't. How do you know? Because I've seen it. And whose possession was it then? In Barney's. Barney Teale's. He kept it under his pillow. You know what. Barney Teal kept under his pillow? Were you that intimate with Mr. Thiel? No, Barney. It's a real kind of you, honey. I can't get over it. Honest, I can't. I mean, why y you should take such good care of her? How? A bum like myself. Well, you've got to eat, haven't you? Sure. Flesh is our master. We only obey. All slaves of the flesh. That's all we are. Isn't that so? Oh, come off it. Hell my appetite goes when I feel it. I have no way to repay you for your kindness. Nonsense. Come on, eat your dinner. You don't get me, do you? I've never been pampered like this. Not even by my Boston twins. You're what? I didn't tell you about them. Oh. A pair of Boston socialites. They were traveling for education. Which is exactly what I provided for them on the deck, all the way from Naples to New York, and then some more education in the department. But I told you about the apartment. That's what I want to give you now. Hey, let's go. Not. Not repay you for that kindness. I wouldn't be that inconsiderate. Just relax, because you're going to thank me. You're going to thank me when it's all over, honey. It's going to be different. You give me so much different from all that kid stuff. You've been wasting your youth, huh? Don't fool around with that. It's loaded. Thank you. That will be all. Yeah. Tell me. Do you imagine that you're in love with the defendant? I don't imagine it. I am. Very much in love. Is that all you're going to ask me? That's all. Mr. Sawyer. Mr. Sawyer. Are you calling your client? I can't imagine why. Sure it isn't fair. Please, Mr. Sawyer, Let me tell my side. All right. If you insist. What on earth's going on in there? Steady, man. Steady. And then the jumping stuff. You'll get us all into trouble. That's a good boy. I gave the gun to Barney. What's so strange about that? I gave it to him. I did not kill him. Is that clear? Perfectly clear, Mr. Christoforidis, but not proved. What proof do you want? I don't want any. I have all the proof I need. Now let me see. Through the kindness of Mr. Peter Hawkins. You got a job at Hawkins store. How much did you make per week? ?9. Ten? But what does it matter? And how much of it did you give to your worthy, hardworking mother? How much? I have never asked him for anything, sir. He needed it more than I do. He is young, sir. We are foreigners. I know. But we are respectable people. All my life I have tried. Right, sir? The picture is now quite clear. Jacobus Christoforidis. That's Joe's full name. Badly needed money. Wouldn't it explain why he a working class lad, but a handsome lad, as you can see, chose to pursue one of the wealthiest girls in the town. That isn't. True. And when Barney Teale threatened to take his place. In his desperation, he was tempted to kill him. Any questions, Mr. Sawyer? What? I'm sorry. I said any questions, Mr. Sawyer? No, thank you. No questions. Please. Mr. Sawyer. Say something. What do you want me to say to all this? Pull something, anything. Just open your mouth to show that you're not dumb. But. Oh, no, not you Could have spoiled you a little bit of fun. You want your revenge, huh? Aren't you overdramatizing a bit? It was only the preliminary hearing. The main trial is yet to come. Oh, I. Know, I know. It was only the dress rehearsal. That's right, sir. Why worry? Why? Because when they take Joe to court, it will be exactly the same thing all over again. You'll see to that, won't you? I may not be in court by the look of things. Well, I. Hope to God not. You've done enough harm as it is. Okay, I'm sure. Right. I've had a hard day. I'm going to have a bath. Wash away the smell of the law. That's why she left you, isn't it? Because you're a fake and a coward. And she was right. And. Come inside, darling. Just like. Paris. Only better. Blonde or dark? Black or white? You name it, we got it. Doesn't miss Brenda work here? Brenda? Sure. Do you want to see her? Yes, please come in. Hey, come on. Come. I've seen you before. Yes, you have. In a bar with a boy called Desmond Flower. You know him? Why do you want to know? Never mind. Do you know him? He's a chief constable son, isn't he? That has no bearing on the question. Look, there's nothing I can tell you. Nothing. I don't want to get into trouble. You just take your money back and let me go. Come on. You're going to answer my questions, All right? Do you know Desmond? Yes. And Peter. And Joe. Joe? Christopher Edis. No, not him. I don't go for criminals. I go for anyone. I go for nice kids. Same as. Barney. Nice rich kids. That's not a crime, is it? Well, if it is, you're not the criminal. You're the victim of anything. Poor little idiot. I don't like you calling me names. I'm not calling you names. I'm just sorry for you. They've got everything, haven't they? The Top Gear suits or whatever they call them. Daddy's Jaguar. Condescending looks for everyone over 30 and still to be introduced to life, they have to come to some grubby hole like this, buying a girl as if she was. I don't know. A packet of chewing gum or something. Little bastards. Don't go. I'll tell you everything you want to know. They could harm you, you know. Not the boys, their parents. I don't give a damn. You're a nice girl. I know what I am. For he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good fellow. For he's a jolly good fellow. And so say all of us. And so say all. A 21st birthday. Is as good an occasion as any to to thank my dear parents. They've been wonderful. They made me. What? I am Here. Here. What's he doing here? He's clowning again. All right. I'll see to. This. Please, ladies and gentlemen, please don't take any notice. We're all a little eccentric in our family. Oh, Paul, you really shouldn't have bothered. I know my way around here. After all, this was my father's house, you know? Oh. That's it. That's what. Something for your son. To do him good, I assure you. You don't mind my joining in the festivities, I hope. Why did you let him in? What could I do? He says he's got a present for Desmond. Go home, Father. Please go home. You see, even my own daughter doesn't want me here. Oh, please. Thank you. But then she's dead, right? Because the young should be left alone. You don't like us very much, do you? And no wonder, because we represent the. The future that you're afraid of. Sometimes we hate you, too. Because you're the past that we never had. You have too much of everything. Too much freedom, too much money, too much sex. Too many years ahead of you. Desmond, 21. We find it hard to forgive you. You'd do better to save his breath for the courtroom. Is absolutely true, Harry. But as you saw this morning, I'm quite incapable of opening my mouth in courtrooms where the only language that people understand is hypocrisy. What exactly do you want? John, I'm sorry. I thought you would have realized by now. I came to give my nephew an 21st birthday present. Here you are, Desmond. Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky. That's the first British edition. Quite a bibliographical rarity, I understand nowadays. It's gorgeous. Well, thank you, Uncle John. Have you read it, by the way? No, I don't think I have. But of course I know what it's all about. You do? I wonder. Excuse me. Crime and Punishment. The thing I like about that book, Harry, is it shows the only court that really matters is not to be found in some ugly, great building in the center of town. It's in ourselves, deep in our own conscience, you know? You give much thought to your conscience, Desmond? Should I? We all should. Twice a day, at least on hygienic grounds. Three times on Sunday. One's conscience is like one's peristalsis. It merits attention. Now is always deeply concerned about his peristalsis. And I'm sure that none of the older group is entirely insensitive to the constrictions of conscience. You already begin to regret your pomposity and your vanity and your sordid little escapades, don't you? Oh, come on now. Our children are perfectly well aware that their respectable parents preach one set of rules and practice another. Wait a minute. Who do you. Think you are to go about censoring other people? I. I'm the worst of the whole bunch. I tortured my child because I was too cowardly to torture myself. I made her feel unwanted, unloved, a stranger in the house of a despicable drunk. That's who I am. And I'm not proud of it. Stop fooling and get out of my house. You've. You've done what you came for. No, I. Haven't, Colonel. Not yet. Desmond, What brand of cigarettes do you smoke? Gauloises blue. Put them on the table so that people can see. Go on. Snap. It's the empty package you left in the bar where we had our little talk. Now, for my next trick I have here a cigarette, butt or fag end with any lady or gentleman in the audience. Care to sniff it? What kind of game is this? It's a game of life and death, wouldn't you say, Desmond? I really wouldn't know, Uncle John. Well, anyway, this cigarette, which happens to be a gold, was was smoked by the murderer of Bonnie Teal on the night of the crime. Would you like me to tell you where I found it? Desmond? No. Thousands of people smoke. I'm sure they do. But only one of them killed Barney Teal. And not content with that, He planted the gun in Joe's locker. And when Joe so clumsily tried to dispose of it, he followed him in his car and informed the police. Isn't that so, Desmond? Are you trying to imply that I kill that bum? Now, why on earth should I have done that? Well, now let's think about that. Thank you. Are you in love with Angela? Good Lord, no. What makes you say that? Would it make you sick to see Joe kissing Angela? Not particularly. Actually, I've never seen him kiss her. Haven't you? Angela? In my inside pocket, there's a photograph. If you've no objection, I'd like you to show it to Desmond. You see this. Joe kissing Angela and there are you watching them with a very peculiar expression on your face, which suggests jealousy. I'm simply pulling a face. You can't go to jail for that. Desmond. Mr.. Can you did. I can. But I don't want to be far better if you were to tell us the truth now. The truth? What do you want me to do? Confess to a crime that I haven't committed? You must be mad. And this is not a lunatic asylum. Now get out. Very well, Desmond. And since you're a young man of good family, you'll see me to the door, won't you? What good is it living in a theater if you can't even put on a proper show? And that's. Don't you worry, because Uncle Barney took care of everything. Everything. Bring on the dancing girls. That's a Barney special for your private and personal delectation. Huh? Did you like her? She's quite a dish. La la la la. Desmond ain't no ordinary strip. That's all right. Yeah. An initiation. Just like in the old days. Prove your manhood and you live happily ever after. Cortez, grab a. Just like in the ancient days. Right on the spot. Hey. If you couldn't go through with it. In the olden days, you were spat upon, scorned, you were despised. He would want that to happen to you. That's all. Oh, she's good. She's good. This. Grab. Go ahead. Oh, yeah. Grab her. Grab a this. Grab a this guy. Hey, grab a. Do you want them all to know what Bonnie knew about you? Do you want the whole world to laugh at you the way he did? Would you like me to put you through another initiation rite? Look here. What's all this about? Leave us alone. Leave us alone. You're asked me what was the motive for this crime? All right. An insane hatred triggered by impotent jealousy is my guess. Anyhow, that's all over. What matters now is the future. It's going to be hard enough for you to stand up in court and confess. But later on, it'll be harder still because no trial ends in the courtroom. Goes on the run inside us. That's the real punishment to be one's own judge, one's own jailer. And ultimately when one has suffered deeply and terribly. Oh. This is where the character Sonya is reading from the Bible to Raskolnikov. She says. Now, a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany. Martha saith unto him. I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection. What is going on? Don't worry. It'll be all right. I can't stand it anymore. But these recollections scarcely troubled him now. He knew that the new life would not be given to him for nothing. That it would cost him great striving, great suffering. This is the beginning of a new story. The story of a man's renewal and regeneration. It was the final words of crime and punishment.
