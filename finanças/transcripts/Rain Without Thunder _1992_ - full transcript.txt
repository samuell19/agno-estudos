So, where did you say you were from, again? ASN. So, what do you want to know that everybody doesn't already know? All I want to do, Allison, is give you an opportunity to talk. That's all it seems like I've been doing for six months. Talking. It's not like anybody listens, really, you know. I mean, they listen, but I... I mean, all this talking, all these questions, all my answers... Doesn't change anything. "Tell me your story," they ask. "Are you sorry for what you did?" Um... "Do you still speak to Jeremy?" One... One reporter even asked me if I still love my mother. In the past year, I've given so many interviews, and with each interview, I expressed such optimism that things were going to get better. And with each succeeding interview, things got worse. So, I would like to express optimism right now that things are going to get better. But I'm coming to learn my lesson. I'm... I'm coming to believe that my daughter and I are in a losing battle. I don't speak so much with the other people here. I mean, I think I could. Everyone seems nice, sort of, but... You know, I just don't wanna get too involved here. Allison's room is in the barracks, which is at the other end of the building. I requested that they let us stay together, at least have our rooms next to each other, but they... They're so careful not to show favoritism to us that they refuse to do simple, little things like that. ALLISON: There's this one girl, Shana. You know, she told me that... That she thinks I'm lucky to have Mom here because it's like living with your family. Shana, I mean... I don't know if she means well, but I just... I mean, I would hardly describe it as luck that Mom is here. It's amazing, you know, how things can turn around so fast. All the plans that you make for yourself and for your family are just thrown out. And they're thrown out by people that you don't even know. I'd forgotten that other people can make plans for you. MURDOCH: The Goldring case was routine. REPORTER: How can you say it was routine? Because it was a simple murder case. Wouldn't it have been difficult to prove without the confession? No. When we have medical evidence, convictions are easy. Getting the medical evidence, though, requires speed and a little luck. But when we get it, convictions are assured. You should understand that we usually urge the defendant to confess and express remorse. In that event, we recommend to the judge that less than the maximum sentence be imposed. Which is? In New York, it is only 10 years for defendant mothers. I advised them not to admit to anything because they had a good case. For one thing, the district attorney, he had no hard evidence. Usually the state has the results of the compulsory uterine examinations or blood tests or something, but... But those tests, they have to be conducted within two weeks of termination to show positive results and they didn't have that here. All they had in the Goldring case was circumstantial evidence. BEVERLY: If this whole thing isn't overturned, we're gonna lose our home. The fines. They've already put a lien against our house. You know... Our home is not exactly the palace that everyone says it is. It's just a home. Beverly never did anything wrong in her entire life. Believe me, she's always been the moral force in the family. It just makes no sense, how unfairly these things can turn out. Apparently, they could have chosen to prosecute me instead of Beverly, but somehow they decided that Beverly was more responsible because she was the one who went with Allison and I didn't. The prosecution really made Beverly Goldring out to be an overbearing, arrogant woman, who was into controlling everything around her and the press bought into that to a certain extent. Though, I must say, that most of the media has focused sympathetically on Allison. BEVERLY: My husband has been a nervous wreck. He wouldn't like it that I was describing it that way, but... It's been really hard on him with the two little girls at home, and... So, my mother flew in last month from Wisconsin to help take care of Piper and Micka. REPORTER: Mrs. Kappelhoff, do you feel that what your daughter did in helping Allison terminate her pregnancy was wrong? Wrong? Do I think it was wrong? My mother, my own mother... I was premature. My mother was an addict. She gave birth to me at a concert. At a music concert. In the mud outside. In the mud, in the rain. She just left me there, left me with strangers. Never saw her. How is this relevant to what your daughter's done? My daughter has done nothing wrong. My daughter is a wonderful mother. She's done nothing she should be ashamed of. Mom said we should think of it like she and Dad are on vacation for a while. And that it's no big deal. And Grandma, you know, she takes care of everything. But when Mom goes on vacation, she goes with Dad. So, she's really, like, on vacation with Allie, 'cause Dad's here with us. ALLISON: Um, outside of my family, I don't think anybody really knew what was going on, you know. Except, of course, Jeremy. And I did tell my roommate at Cornell, Abra. I mean, it's hard not to talk about things when you're roommates. And obviously, during the year we became friends. So, we talked about it. So, you took an interest in Allison's pregnancy. Well, like I said, it's hard not to talk about things when you're roommates. Um, there was this guy where Abra grew up, in Schnectady, and he does termination, so... Um, and I think she knew someone who went to him once for one, too. So... But she wasn't suggesting that I should go to him or anything. Allison was thinking about going to a terminator. But I talked her out of it. You can't trust those people. They're all smell-smock. Plus, it's dangerous, I told her. And, of course, it's illegal. She was real confused because she didn't wanna tell her mom. Abra told me that, I guess, Cuba is the only place nearby where p-term is legal. And she had a cousin, I think, who went there for termination. So, she started planning on how I could get there without anyone knowing. She got this whole plan together, um... That I would go on a weekend, you know. I would take the muni to Stewart Airport and then skip to Cuba. Do all this early on a Saturday morning sometime. She figured that I could get to Cuba before lunch, even. WARDEN: If you look at the population here at Walker Point or any of the facilities for defendant mothers throughout the country. What do you see? I'll tell you what you see. You see poor women. They're all poor. And there is something wrong with this. And everyone knows there's something wrong with this. Particularly because it's not only poor women who are committing the crime of fetal murder. Wealthy women commit this crime, too. I called a staff meeting to discuss the problem. I was there, John Bowen, Judy Richter, I presented the problem simply. Poor women are imprisoned for fetal murder. Rich women are not, because they leave the country to get a termination. So, how can we correct this problem legislatively? Judy suggested that when we determine that a woman has had a termination elsewhere, we publicize it. Sort of to embarrass rich women into not having a foreign termination. John thought this would be utterly ineffective. And I agreed with him. Legislators, they do nothing except make laws. They just sit around and write laws. That's what they do. They... Thousands and thousands of legislators in this country and they all write laws. John suggested that we somehow perform pregnancy tests on departing women at the airport. But we decided that it would be too expensive. Plus, the Port Authority would raise hell at such a suggestion. If they didn't do anything, we'd be better off. If the legislators would just stay home, not even come in to work, the country would be better off. We continued talking, and... Someone mentioned the word "kidnapping." Kidnapping. Isn't it like a kidnapping? The kidnapping of a child, only here, it's an unborn child. A kidnapping for the purpose of committing murder. The pertinent part of the kidnapping law states that a person shall be considered guilty of first degree murder if he or she commits upon a pregnant female an abortional act outside the state of New York which causes the miscarriage of such fetus, if he or she resides in the state and with such fetus leaves with the intent of committing such abortional act. Judy saw a whole host of constitutional problems with it, but John got excited about it. And he and Judy agreed to make a stab at drafting a proposed statute. Within a week, they had written what is now the Unborn Child Kidnapping Act. When Grover Cole submitted the Kidnapping Act bill to the state assembly, he made a speech. And in that speech, he said, and I quote, that, "Nature had given women so much power. "The law cannot afford to give her more." And then he smiled. Said it was just a joke. And, frankly... I think it's a nice piece of work. Of course, it's got some kinks in it. But every new law has kinks. With time, those problems will be corrected. Either judicially or legislatively. The media gave little or no attention when the act was passed by the Assembly. Of course, there was a news article or two speculating whether the governor would sign it. But the media didn't find a story until the Goldrings were indicted. So you think the media's interest is illegitimate. Legitimacy has nothing to do with it. The media is interested in the Goldrings because the Goldrings have money and a fair complexion. Beverly was actually lucky. She was indicted and convicted as a defendant mother and not a terminator, because if she'd have been convicted as a terminator, which she could have been under the law, 35 years to life. And she wouldn't have been staying at Walker Point, either, which... Some say is just shy of a country club. We treated both the Goldrings as defendant mothers. REPORTER: So you think the Goldrings got off easy? Mrs. Goldring, who's technically not a defendant mother, but a conspirator with the terminator. You must understand that the first conviction under new law is always treated more sensitively. And this is true until the law is understood and appreciated by the public. You think this law will eventually be appreciated? It certainly represents a revolutionary approach in correcting the racial and class injustices of fetal murder prosecutions. The concept of kidnapping an unborn child is admittedly novel. And it may have constitutional problems, but we believe those problems can be overcome. The Goldring case is a test case. It is the first step toward that public appreciation of the kidnapping law. WARDEN: Walker Point is more a hospital than a prison. This facility is not for retribution. It's for rehabilitation. These women have to be rehabilitated, so they understand the nature of what they did, or tried to do. WOMAN: This guy tells me that all you do is flurk a pop bottle. See, you flurk it up and stick it in and let it shoot up inside and that kills the bed bugs. So... He had these two Cokes next to the bed, and after... Well, we finished. He starts flurking up the bottles and he shoots both of them into me. And he felt real proud, like he knew what he was doing. So... I never see the guy again and I get fruited, anyway. First of all, I'm only in this spital for three years. This is the end of my second year, so it's almost over. Most of the girls here got fruited. Not me. I didn't kill no pop lolly. REPORTER: What happened, exactly? WOMAN: I was working at this food fare, Newburg. And these two velvet heads come in, from the health department. They flash their badges and they tell the manager that they have a warrant for me. They don't tell me nothing. They make me get in their Hummer and they take me to the M Center. So... I tell Star, my sister. She says that the only thing to do is those baby bombs. So she gets me the number of this guy in Johnson city and... I call him and... He just hands them to me, like that. Just gives me this envelope with the two bombs inside and I just give him the chinkers and that was it. The due doc takes me to this small room, where I get undressed and put on the sheet. The doc takes an S-gram, which I never had before, you know, with the probe and all. So, the doc takes a sample from me, of me, and gives it to these mobards. And they also grab my S-gram. I asked Star how I should take them, like, one per day, or what? And she doesn't really know, but she says she heard you have to whack the pop lolly hard to get rid of it, so... Maybe I should take them both together. So that's what I do. They didn't find anything except that the S-gram showed I had a uudie. Most of my friends have the thing. You put it in yourself and it stays in for a couple of months. It's real simple. You don't have to worry about anything I got it from a friend. They tried to get me to tell who but I didn't. A uudie gets you three years, max, and I got the max for not squealing where I got it. I was bleeding and quenching around and... My mom was hysteria news. Star was crying... And the docs told Mom I was fruited and I was losing it. So... They figured the whole thing out. I got poisoned with the two bombs and all. His stuff was still in me, so they knew. They knew. They told Mom. The police were there right away. I'm quenching around and the police are yelling at me. [SIGHS] REPORTER: What were they saying? They wanted to know where I got the bombs. Mom insisted that I tell them. Star got real scared. She said after that... She was scared I was going to die. But I didn't. I just ended up here. KAPPELHOFF: They wouldn't let us see Bev this last weekend. Something about how Bev snapped at one of the guards or nurses. It's the second time it's happened. I don't mind for myself but it is hard on the children. Micka and Piper have not seen their mother for three weeks now. And Allie says she hasn't seen her either. Some kind of punishment. It's all beginning to get to Bev, this whole thing. The guilt, she blames herself for what happened. I haven't seen my family for three weeks. And all because I threw this plate of food at this nurse. They have the nurses bring you the food here. So I asked myself why? Why do they have the nurses bring you the food? And then it dawned on me. It's because they're putting something in the food. Something... Some kind of drug. At first, I didn't notice that anything was happening. But I could swear I felt all sloomy or strange after eating. So, I asked Allison if she felt strange after eating. And she said no. But Allison has been having really bad headaches ever since we got here. And it all makes sense. So... I accused the nurse of putting something in the food. And she snapped at me. So, I threw the plate at her. I can tell you that Beverly Goldring has been very difficult. How so? She's uncooperative on even the smallest little thing. She's gotten into several arguments and a physical thing with a nurse. And... I wasn't here, but I heard that she and another resident got into a fight. Do you know what it was about? Beverly Goldring made a comment in the cafeteria that she wasn't like the other residents. I guess she said it in a way that was taken as... Racially insensitive. Well, Alithia McCullough took a swing at her. You see the sign they got at the gate? It's a cure facility. If that ain't soft. Make it sound like it's real cushy in here. No, this ain't no facility. Let's just call it what it is. It's a spital. They call us residents. Residents, as if this was some kind of hotel. Hotel Hell, maybe. Isn't that a bit dramatic? Have you spoken to Angela? Angela Q, have you seen what they've done to her? REPORTER: Angela, there have been reports that you've been abused here. That they have mistreated you. [FLIES BUZZING] Do you feel, Angela, that you're being treated well? WARDEN: Angela Q is a special case. She was very violent. And in fact, she should not have been sent here at all. She's someone who should be either in an institution for the troubled, or a maximum security prison. It is true, though, Angela, that they give you drugs here, isn't it? [FLY BUZZING] What's that thing on your neck? They out-suck here. What's that thing on Angela's neck? It's nothing. How can you say it's nothing? Angela says... I think she implied you take blood or fluids from her. A side effect of the drug Probisone is mild hallucinations. Angela believes she has worms in her head. We put a fake device on her neck to make-believe we remove the worms. She believes it. And it eradicates her negative hallucination. REPORTER: The way I understand it, Angela Q has significant psychiatric problems. Look... You are not interested in what they are doing to us here. You only want to hear about the fairheads. Rich, white fairheads. This is the only time I've ever seen one of you vid-pushers around here. When some rich, white bitch ends up in this shit bed. Mom thinks that they're giving us tipsy cake and that it's causing me to have these headaches. I've been getting them all the time. I wake up in the middle of the night with these piercing headaches. It's always a bad dream. It's one of those things where you can't figure out if the dream is causing the headache or the headache is causing the bad dream. But I don't think it's the food. Look. The attention that sometimes focuses on the use of drugs at Walker Point is really overblown. We're here to help. We're here to improve the lives of these girls. We do occasionally use drugs, usually because of violent or abusive behavior. But this is not the norm. Most of the girls here appreciate what we do for them. They're probably getting more love and attention here than they got on the outside. HART: We don't walk with men. We walk behind them. We walk in their footsteps, to their rhythm, with their gait, down their paths, to their heaven. A man's heaven. Those women who choose to walk with men, they're fools. They're fools to think they can control their destination. A house built by men is a house built for men. We must build our own house. We must do it. We must do it with our own hands. No one will do it for us. WOMAN: Miss Hart is one of our more strident members. And as you know, she's our founder. But I do want to point out, without any lack of respect to Miss Hart, that it's not our policy to have a confrontational public image. The Atwood Society won't survive financially if it's to be viewed as a fringe group. And Miss Hart frightens a lot of people. Particularly a lot of women. If we're going to make changes, political changes, we must be political. People forget. Men would have us forget that prior to 1850, we could get a legal abortion in every state in the union. And then, between 1850 and 1900, in just 50 years, just two generations, every state passed laws making it criminal to get an abortion. People refused to believe that what is far-fetched can happen in just two generations. And to be political, we must sound reasonable. We must sound thoughtful. We're in the present political environment. For the Atwood Society, to call for a woman's right to termination on demand would destroy us. Politically and financially. But what happened in the 1800s that caused the change? Well, it was not caused because of any concern for the fetus. The fetus had nothing to do with it. Protestant men had power. And they were afraid they were not keeping up with the reproductive rate of Catholic immigrants. You see, the wives of these Protestant men were having too many abortions. REPORTER: Was it really that simple? Nothing is simple. There was a time when defendant mothers were not prosecuted for fetal murder. Only the terminator was prosecuted. This was generally true even though the law made it criminal for women to give themselves terminations. Prosecutors used to make deals with the mothers to get them to testify against the terminator. But this strategy never really worked. Women continued to give themselves terminations any way they could. The only way to stop women from this behavior was to prosecute them. So, our emphasis is on eradicating the system of punishment for women convicted of fetal murder. It's one of our missions to convince the public that women are the victims of the terminator, rather than instigators of the termination. We propose that the law should be changed to emphatically assert that a pregnant woman does not have the capacity to grant consent to termination. If a pregnant woman can't consent to termination, she can't commit the crime of fetal murder. Only the terminator commits that crime. Now, admittedly, this may be viewed as a fiction, but so is the basis of many laws. Years of back-alley abortions, torn uteruses, punctured vaginas, ripped arteries, blood dripping down thighs onto filthy tenement floors. Years of poisoning ourselves in a desperate attempt to control our bodies, our futures. Years of being on strange tables in strange neighborhoods, being worked on by strange hands, surrounded by the stench of strange rooms. Last month, I removed these from a young woman. On the street, they're called camel balls. [CLICKING] I'm told that they have that name because Bedouin tribes in the Middle East used to put balls or rocks into the uteruses of their camels so the camels wouldn't get pregnant. A pregnant camel was useless, apparently. Well, somehow, this practice has now been adopted by some women here. This is a Y-type uudie. I understand they're not easy to insert because a woman must get it beyond her cervix, but they are apparently effective. They've become much more of a problem over the last decade or so because of the common belief that barrier devices, which are legal contraceptives, aren't reliable. So there's now a healthy black market in these little things. Uudies are irritants in the uterus preventing, on most occasions, the implantation of a fertilized egg. Because they operate in that way, that is, as an abortive device rather than a simple barrier contraceptive, they're illegal here in the United States. Uudies would be quite effective, except that the women who are using them don't know what they're doing. They're quite ignorant in these matters. And they'll insert in themselves uudies that are not sterile. So instead of being a simple irritant, the uudie causes a serious infection. The woman I took these camel balls out of, she was infected so badly that she was bleeding internally. And last week a woman was admitted into emergency unconscious. She drank a pint of turpentine mixed with sugar. It's a technique that involves trying to poison the fetus to death before it kills the mother. It's kind of like burning down the house to kill the pig. REPORTER: What happened to that woman? She's still comatose. But she is pregnant still and we're doing everything we can to birth the child. My own mother syringed chicken blood into her vagina and then went to a doctor claiming vaginal bleeding just to trick him into giving her a uterine cleaning. He gave an abortion and didn't know it. Women inserting foreign objects into their vagina. Women drinking poison potions to kill their fetus. These misguided women, these pitiful women, are all poor. These are the tools of the poor. Rich women have other tools. Recently, they've started going to France for the tube implant that releases a 10-year drug. The so-called time-released baby bomb. They come back over here with an implant that is now made of material that does not read on an X-ray. These women. These wealthy women living in their rich, protected wombs are getting away with silent murder. That is what fetal termination is, in essence. Silent murder. REPORTER: What did you do? ALLISON: There was this clinic on campus and... I just went. They took my blood and they told me that I was pregnant. [SIGHS] I didn't even think about, you know, that they would send a report. And I mean... It was this small clinic. It was on campus. I just thought they'd... I don't know what I thought. You know, it was like, you miss your period and you're the only one that knows, right, and then you go to the clinic for a check-up and the whole state knows. So I saw Jeremy and I told him. Jeremy's first reaction was pretty much utter fear. His eyes got all wide and... It took a moment before he spoke and... He asked me, "What should we do?" So, I... [CLEARS THROAT] I told him I thought I was too young and I didn't think I... I didn't think I wanted it. Jeremy was real relieved to hear me say that. He sure was. I just want to set it right. I was there from the beginning, not Beverly Goldring. I was there every step of the way. Allison came to me, not her mother. She told me about it. First, we talked. We knew what the right thing was. We knew she'd have to have the baby. It's no question. It's the law. It's the only moral thing to do. It wasn't until after she told her mother that things started to change. Everybody says that Beverly was the more active participant. But Beverly didn't participate any more than any one of us. And we all sat around and talked about what to do. Even Tanner, he sat with us and we talked. I mean, if anyone wanted Allison to do it, it was Tanner. Um, I told him that I was thinking of telling my mother. And that she would probably understand. And at first he tried to talk me out of it because he was afraid that Mom would convince me to have the baby. Like I said in court, we sat around the living room. Beverly Goldring made this big speech about how Allison cannot have the baby. That it would change her life, that she's too young. She never asked me how I felt about it. I mean, it's my baby as much as Allison's and there's Mrs. Goldring making the decision. Of course, my daughter asked me what I would do if I were her. I told her that I would probably I would probably terminate. But I didn't pressure her. And certainly Spencer didn't pressure her. You know, she said it was my decision. And... Frankly, I had already made up my mind. You know, with Jeremy wanting the p-term and my mother leaning... Leaning in that direction. It just confirmed to me that my decision wasn't... Wasn't, you know... My decision wasn't horrible or anything. Spencer wanted to take the whole family to Sweden, make it a family thing. Micka was running around saying how she wanted to go. And I said, "Absolutely not." I didn't want to make it a big deal or any major thing. Spencer and the girls were to stay home while Allison and I took a short trip. It's a good thing it was like that. Otherwise, they probably would have put the whole family in jail. MAN: Three years ago, we filed a lawsuit against New York State. It was a class action on behalf of all African-American defendant mothers who are incarcerated. We sought to enjoin the enforcement of the fetal murder statute because, as applied to defendant mothers, we claimed it was discriminatory against African-American women. The real object was to stop fetal murder prosecution against all women. And we thought this was the best way to do it. We thought we were shooting an arrow into the heart of this problem. It turned out to be a boomerang instead, because they enacted the Unborn Child Kidnapping Act. The Kidnapping Act was their response to our lawsuit. No, it's true, we didn't know about the kidnapping law or at least we didn't talk about it. Although we did become aware of it. I heard about it from my roommate and I told Allison. Before they left for Europe, I told Allison. Allison told her mother and her mother told her not to worry about it. Of course I knew about the kidnapping law before we went to Stockholm. But I thought, "It's a new law." And I found out that Swedish law requires total confidentiality. That you don't have to declare your specific purpose upon entering Sweden. And that the Swedish authorities wouldn't co-operate with any foreign government. So, no one could find out. REPORTER: So, why don't we start with your research? MAN: My research? Can you summarize it? Your conclusions. Hardly. Well, your book on the history of political movements. What can you tell me about your research as it relates to women? It doesn't.Excuse me? It doesn't relate to women. Didn't you read my book? Well, your book says nothing about women or women's movements. And I guess that's what I'm getting at. It says nothing about women's movements because they do not and never have existed. So, I take it you don't think the great advances women have made in the past 100 years is the result of their increased political power. Any kind of advance that women have made, as you say, had nothing to do with any political movements organized by women. Women have never organized into a voting bloc. This is so because women are inclined to collaborate with men. History shows us that both in their private and public lives, women collaborate and conspire with men. And they will do so even to the detriment of other women. A woman's movement was born in the mid 20th century. A woman's political movement would spread like a fire, burning the landscape built by men. Oh, there are some, I suppose, who believe that there was a women's movement in the 1960s and 1970s when there was a torrent of women in the workforce and they consequently garnered some economic power. The 1960s through the end of the last century was a time of great economic expansion. And there was a tremendous male labor shortage. This labor shortage was dealt with quite simply by the call for women to assist in that group. See, women did not push their way into corporate boardrooms. They were invited in. Our season changed by the year 2000. A chill was developing. Our spring only lasted two generations. But it only takes two generations. It takes one generation to fight for liberty. It takes only one generation to lose it. The old Roe versus Wade case, which permitted women the right to legal termination nationwide, was never dramatically overturned by any one judicial ruling. Instead, the Supreme Court simply took a hammer and chisel and slowly chipped away at it. Now, this gradual chipping away was tolerated because no one believed any states would criminalize termination. Or if any did, it would only be a few. Indeed by 2005, only four states had any sort of criminal statue. You see, the interesting thing here is that Americans, while they will react decisively in the face of a crisis, will nevertheless tolerate gradual trends. Even if these trends are insidious. When people do not have liberty, they crave it. They cherish it. But when once a generation obtains it, they then ignore it. They so much as place it on the doorstep to be snatched away. It was many streams, all rushing together at the same time. In addition to the things I had mentioned, the generation in power at the turn of the century was getting old and conservative and very scared. This, combined with the hyper crime of the day, the burgeoning underclass, the lingering street drug problem and the continuing decline of the American economy, all created a perception, a panic, if you will, that the American social fabric was breaking down. This caused widespread broad-based support for imposing strict moral codes in all communities. So you see, Americans really turned very conservative. Particularly with regard to social issues. People will invest more energy into protecting their jewelry than protecting their liberty. Women not only placed their anatomical liberty on their doorstep. They elected the people who snatched it away. So by 2005, the states were allowed to prohibit a woman from terminating her pregnancy. Well, at the time, it was unclear under the law how far the states could go. But today, though, as you well know, a woman is permitted to terminate her pregnancy only if it is medically certified that the pregnancy seriously risks the life of the woman. Essentially, that's all that's left of the old Wade case. Mom wanted to get in and out of Sweden real fast. You know, just there and out. Um, we took the skip jet. It took two hours. We arrived in the evening and stayed at this hotel in Stockholm. And we took a taxi to the clinic the next morning. I was nervous the whole time. I couldn't help but feel that I was hiding something. I try not to refer to it as guilt because I still do not believe that we were doing anything wrong. But I had this sick feeling and I was uncomfortable the whole time on the plane. They had me speak to a therapist or a counselor. She was very nice. She told me about alternatives. You know, like adoption and... They told me what to expect, that they use a medical procedure rather than drugs because of the problems with drugs. I just sat there in this white room, with white chairs. There's not a lot of color in Sweden. Everything just seemed so... [SIGHS] It sparkled with white and chrome and white marble and... It was very still. And quiet. Simple. They asked me what kind of music I wanted playing. They play music during the procedure. And they let you pick. So, of course, I asked them if they had any Puru Guru. And I couldn't believe it, but they did. So they played that one. You know, um... It really went pretty fast. They had somebody holding my hand and talking to me about things. I don't know. It really wasn't... Well, it went fast. REPORTER: You've written, Father, that one forgotten reason fetuses must remain protected by the state is because of what you call the messiah question. Can you explain that for our viewers? The messiah question is a relatively recent church doctrine, being articulated fully just around the turn of the century. Now, the doctrine fundamentally states that we cannot know when, or more importantly, how the messiah will return. He may come from above. He may appear as an apparition. Or he may arrive in the womb of a woman like he did the last time. And because it is possible that the messiah will appear as he did before, we must view every fetus with deference and respect, even awe for it. Every fetus. Because one of them just might be the embodiment of his return. The messiah question has remained archived as a doctrine of the church because secular people simply refuse to understand and refuse to consider what the world would be like if Mary had terminated her pregnancy. So, the church has kept the messiah question primarily in-house. And the women's movement, the pro-termination movement got lost in the political and social hysteria that marks the beginning of our century. And although the Wade case had been whittled down to a mere splinter, women's reproductive lives didn't seem to change that much in all but a few states. And as women began to fear less and less that their reproductive lives were going to change dramatically, the wind left the sails of the women's movement. And so, like dominoes falling, with no one paying much attention, one state after another began to severely restrict termination. By 2017, 41 states had some form of criminal statute regarding termination. And this frightening trend did not rekindle any women's movement, because the generation in power, which were a generation of senior citizens, didn't consider it anything to fear. Indeed, what America needed most at the time was a greater population of young people to support the economy. So, on a very real level, it was termination that was to be feared. What really changed the church's role and power with respect to the unborn was the acceptance by papal encyclical of barrier forms of contraceptive devices. This occurred in 2007. It was a victory for women and for the church. You see, the Catholic church was always viewed as unfair with respect to termination because it didn't permit a woman a fighting chance to avoid pregnancy in the first place by using some form of contraceptive device. So, when the church ended its opposition to the use of barrier forms of contraceptives, it came as an absolute shock and was hailed as a major victory for Catholic women. But then, the church's opposition to pregnancy termination gained new force. The 20th century American had a fetishistic concern for personal liberty at the expense of all else, even religion. It was as if somehow God had died and left a huge moral vacuum, which resulted in the killing of millions and millions of baby boys and girls. And then the 28th Amendment was proposed by several congressmen, which, among other things, defined a fertilized egg as a person with full constitutional rights. Some states tried to fight the amendment, like New York and Oregon, but there was little they could do because constitutional amendments do not require unanimity. The 28th Amendment was conceived with great compassion. Now, don't forget this amendment emphatically states that no pregnant woman can be imprisoned, because that would be tantamount to imprisoning an unborn child. A child who has done no wrong. And the amendment has set up a national adoption agency and a child care system. These are institutions of great compassion. REPORTER: The prohibition against imprisoning pregnant women has proven to be a problem, though. Not really. I can remember when it was first proposed that there were people who thought that this would be a license for pregnant women to [LAUGHS] commit all sorts of crimes, or female criminals to rush out and get themselves pregnant after committing a crime. This has not happened. The 28th Amendment was actually viewed as pro-women because it contained a prohibition against incarcerating a pregnant woman. It permitted a woman to get a uteral cleansing without regard to the presence of a fertilized egg within seven days of a rape, provided she reported the rape before the cleansing and there was some reasonable showing of sexual abuse. And of course, many women at the time the amendment was passed and still now believe that pregnancy termination exploits women because it turns them into objects solely for sex. I instructed my assistant to get a copy of all positive pregnancy test registrations from Albany for the prior four months, and we found four Rockland County residents whose pregnancies were registered. Two were still pregnant. One claimed she had miscarried, but she comes from a poor family and her miscarriage was confirmed by her doctor. The fourth was Allison Goldring. Jeremy called me and he was panicked. He said that the Rockland DA called him and they were coming up and he didn't know what to do. I got this phone call, a lawyer from Rockland County. I... He asked all sorts of questions, things like... "Where you aware of it? "Do you know Allison Goldring and how well?" At first I said I had to go, but he kept... He was persistent and he was... He had a threatening tone. Instead of contacting the Goldrings, two Assistant DAs pay Jeremy Tanner a visit. We knew about Tanner because the pregnancy registration forms contained the name and addresses of the father, if known. When Allison simply filled it out, it was luck from a prosecutorial standpoint because we so often don't have this information. Tanner told us everything. He started talking about the future, his future. How things have never been easy for him. His folks were pretty poor. And I think his dad died when he was about 10. So... He was saying how hard he had worked. How Cornell was such a big thing for him. He seemed pretty tired from all the thinking he'd been doing. REPORTER: Didn't he have a lawyer? He was appointed a lawyer who advised him to cooperate. And when we heard that the Goldrings went to Sweden, we knew we'd get an indictment under the new law. I was paranoid, so I asked Dr. Gustafson of the Stockholm Women's Clinic not to send us any reports or letters or records. And I paid for everything with checks made out to cash. So... So, there was no record. No actual evidence, until Tanner turned on us. Child abuse and drug abuse are major problems. The states intervened aggressively between parent and child when the child was being abused. This is when the states likewise started to intervene between the mother and her unborn child. REPORTER: Intervene in what way? Pregnant women used to be able to take drugs, drink alcohol, suck on burning tobacco, work in unsafe environments. All sorts of prenatal abuse and inappropriate behavior went on. To fight this, the courts started appointing guardians for the fetus to prohibit the mother from doing anything that would harm the fetus. Drug-related crimes became a very bad problem in the late 20th century. Public pressure grew intense, so intense it shook the very foundation of the Supreme Court. At one time, a police officer could search your home only if he had probable cause that you had evidence. Then in 2003, the Supreme Court held that if an apartment building was known to be infested with drugs then it would be reasonable for the police to search every apartment in that building. These expanded legal concepts of police power, the power to search whole neighborhoods. Concepts that arose because of drugs and crime have also been applied to a woman's anatomy. REPORTER: Allie tells me that you were in the house when those guys came. Can you tell me about it? MICKA: These guys show up. They asked if Mom or Dad was around. But they weren't. They asked if Allison was home. So, I call for her. She came down the stairs and they handed her some papers. And she didn't know what they were. The one woman was doing all the talking. So they told her, the woman told her, that they had a warrant to take blood. She told Allie that it would be simple. Allie told them that they should wait for Mom. But they said no. They showed badges. What did Allie do? Allie got scared. But she sat at the kitchen table. The guy stuck the needle in her arm. We took the blood test of Allison pursuant to a warrant. The test showed nothing. We then got a warrant to do a uterine examination. That, too, showed nothing. But both those examinations were pursuant to duly authorized judicial warrants. All you need is circumstantial evidence to get a warrant in New York to examine a woman. Allison's pregnancy registration form, the fact that she was no longer pregnant, couldn't prove that she had a natural miscarriage... I mean, that's sufficient to satisfy a court to issue a warrant to get a blood test and a uterine examination on Allison. REPORTER: Is it difficult to get a warrant to examine a woman? In New York, it's very difficult. It's not like we go around grabbing women off the street, doing tests at random. We're not like Missouri. We do not have random drug testing in New York. A warrant here requires evidence of substantial probative value before we can impose a test and that is not easy to get. Could it be, Father, that society has gone a bit too far in punishing women? Your concern is the punishment of women. Among other things. Your concern might shift if you could watch a terminator at work. The terminator will dilate the cervix and enter the womb, cut the child into pieces and then remove the pieces one by one. Now, by the seventh week, each fetal part is recognizable as it is being removed. These parts that he removes are arms, legs, a head. Parts which, just a moment ago, were part of a living human being. The terminator might prefer to withdraw some amniotic fluid with a needle and then replace it with a toxic saline solution that burns the child severely. Within an hour, the child's heart will stop beating and soon thereafter the mother will go into labor and deliver a baby, a dead baby. The vicious terminator might do a cesarean, by opening up the mother's abdomen and lifting the baby out. The child will often be alive and then the terminator has a disposal problem, so he may smother it, or he may drown it, or he may just put the baby aside and allow it to cry itself to death. Men are afraid of women. Men are afraid that women will have too much power. You don't see it. Like a fish cannot describe water, men cannot see their fear of women. And this fear is the very thing that moves their politics about reproductive rights. Men somehow respond to a woman's right to terminate her fetus as if they confront the possibility of their own potential non-existence at a woman's own hands. REPORTER: Isn't it true that states are allowed to remove a fetus in some situations? Well, in 2018, Louisiana enacted a law that in the event a pregnancy seriously risks the life of a woman, the state would be allowed to remove the fetus in an attempt to keep it alive. The law has since been held constitutional, but it had little significance until recently, when medicine developed techniques to keep a 4-month-old fetus alive outside the womb. So, if a pregnancy seriously risks the life of a woman, she now only has the right to remove the fetus. Yes. Now the termination of a pregnancy does not necessarily mean the termination of a fetus. Only nine months, that is all that is being asked of a woman. Only nine months in return for a lifetime of another. Rather than wait nine months to place a baby up for adoption, why shouldn't a woman be permitted to place a fetus up for adoption at the fourth month? Now that medicine can grow a fetus to its birth age outside the womb. This would seem a fair and reasonable compromise. Of course, there is the question of who will pay for the costly procedure to grow a fetus. The Atwood society believes that the state should make a contribution and share the burden of fetal development. The Atwood Society's fetal adoption proposal is a very evil thing. What they are attempting to do is to create a secondary market in fetuses, indeed, if you read the fine print, what they would really like to do is to create a liquid market in fertilized eggs, so that a mother who is reluctant could remove a month-old embryo and negotiate it on some commodity exchange and eventually have it placed in the womb of the highest bidder, in the womb of a woman who presumably has been unable to get pregnant. We have taken the joy out of motherhood and replaced it with some kind of public duty. We've turned the beauty of motherhood into the onus of a compulsory draft. Motherhood has become nothing more than state employment. You cannot love motherhood because the state makes you be a mother. Just as you cannot love a flag if the state forces you to salute it. Several years ago, I understand that you represented Max Sinclair when she was sued by some of the women who claimed to have been hurt by her book. No, no. Actually, the truth is I really represented her book and not Miss Sinclair, I wasn't... I wasn't permitted to meet the woman. Why is that? Well, when I was retained by some anonymous benefactor, Miss Sinclair had just ripped the eyeballs out from the face of a nurse. And they drugged her and shackled her and threw her into a white padded room. So, I hardly think any meeting with her would've been fruitful. REPORTER: Do you have any regrets about One Foot in Hell, about having written it? No. As a writer, I can understand how you might feel that way. But personally, you must harbor some... Some grief. Grief? How do you feel about the... I think it's been estimated that nearly 175,000 women permanently and irreversibly sterilized themselves as recommended in your book. Does this not imbue you with some remorse? And I think the book represents a poetic, primal scream from hell. No, it's more beautiful than it is dangerous. I think, in general, people... It's what they don't write that's more harmful. I guess all I'm really asking is whether you remain a proponent of female sterilization. Do you still believe in what you wrote? I was 20 when I wrote it. Just a child. I take it that means you no longer believe in sterilization as a means of attaining power for women? My book was wrong. Both of our feet are in hell. ALLISON: Mom was pretty hysterical when she found out that they took my blood. And after that, nothing really happened for a while. So, we thought we had nothing to worry about. But then Dad got the call from the police. He said they were coming by. You know, to take Mom and me to court. Mom was, well, she got pretty frantic. You know, because we figured the test and the exam did show something. And our lawyer tried to find out what was going on, but we didn't find out till later that, you know, it wasn't the test. It didn't show anything that he had... They had other evidence instead. We tried to get information from Stockholm, but they wouldn't cooperate. But we did get the travel information and the telephone records, which showed they had called the clinic in Sweden and we had the Stockholm clinic's endorsement on the back of Mrs. Goldring's check, which she made out to cash. Based on Tanner's testimony, the travel information, the telephone records, a copy of the check and the pregnancy registration notice form, we got an indictment. Andrea Murdoch is a brilliant attorney and I have nothing derogatory to say about her, except I will say [SCOFFS] she has political aspirations and I think it was quite obvious that she wanted to become the first New York State prosecutor that got a conviction under the Kidnapping Act. So... Particularly, a conviction against a wealthy, Caucasian female. Not to mention two wealthy, Caucasian females. Mr. Garson, you know, he's saying that we all sat around and Mom and I made this decision to confess, that it was planned. It really wasn't like that. Trials are just so long, you know. And I'm just sitting there for three days listening to all these people who had seen me, like that nurse from the Cornell clinic and the ticket person from the airport. They even got that stewardess who had been on the skip jet to Sweden. And of course I had to listen to Jeremy tell his story. Jeremy Tanner, he essentially told the truth about the crime. What he lied about were his own intentions and involvement in regards to Allison's pregnancy termination. REPORTER: Why did he lie about that? [SCOFFS] Andrea Murdoch wanted him to. See, Tanner's a much better witness for the prosecution if he fought the Goldrings and tried to convince them not to terminate Allison's pregnancy. It just makes the Goldrings look bad. And in addition, Murdoch needed a witness. And I'm sure that Tanner's lawyer advised Tanner to cooperate with Murdoch. I mean, this way, both Murdoch and Tanner are happy. Murdoch gets a perfect witness and Tanner doesn't get prosecuted, because he presumably wasn't involved with the crime and Murdoch doesn't catch any heat for not prosecuting Tanner. It's, you know. REPORTER: What about his story? It was a bunch of half-truths, really. He was shading everything. Trying to make him look good and Mom look bad, like they'd been having some tug-of-war about my baby. So, you know, I just didn't feel I could get up there and... You know, be a poser. I couldn't... Couldn't sit in a witness box and just make up a story. I mean, I had the p-term. I had it and I... I just didn't want to lie about it. Why did you put Allison on the witness stand? I didn't. She insisted upon testifying. So, you must've known she was going to confess. No, I didn't know. I didn't know what she was gonna do. Certainly, you didn't coach her to say anything other than the truth. That would be grounds for disbarment. Do you have any idea why the Goldrings didn't retain you to handle the appeal? I wouldn't know. Perhaps you should ask Beverly Goldring that question. It was surprising. Mr. Garson just stood there. He was embarrassed. He wanted to stop her, but Allison just kept talking and giving away all the details. I was shaken. Allison didn't talk to me about it. She didn't tell me that she was going to confess, so I was hurt. I just sat there and watched our lives about to melt away. There's nothing I could do about it. I couldn't stop her. I was angry. It was humiliating. It was a relief. It was like there had been some heavy, black tar on me, just stuck on my back like glue. And suddenly it was gone. It was easier for me to breathe. It was easier for me to look up. Look up at people. It's easier for me to talk. To talk again without my throat tightening up. You know, at first, when I started, I was scared, but as I went on, it got easier. It was almost exhilarating to explain the whole thing. At the beginning, she just stared out at nothing. She talked like she was hypnotized or something. But then she... Her eyes... Her eyes got watery. She didn't really cry. I think she was too scared to. You should've seen Mr. Garson. He just... He stood there like a stone and his eyes... [LAUGHS] They were about to pop. And I could also see Mom. I didn't wanna give you the wrong impression before, but... I mean, I also felt bad, you know. I mean, Mom was... Well, she was pretty pissed off that I did it. But, you know, afterwards she understood. Besides, the media started to like us a lot more. Especially after we both got seven years. Even now, after all these months, I still feel very confused about everything. About how I feel about what happened. Before, I was so certain. But now I'm not. God knows I have these dark thoughts that maybe I did something wrong. That maybe I should've told Allison to... But I didn't tell her not to. I mean, sure I told her that it would be tough, that it would change the rest of her life if she went ahead. But I didn't tell her that she couldn't have the baby. I didn't make her do anything. I only last week found out what happened to Allison and her mother. It's a terrible thing they should be in prison like that. So, I went to the records, Allison's laboratory report. A report is usually checked by the outpatient staff and a copy is sent to the patient. But here, no copy was sent at Mrs. Goldring's request. So, I became curious the other day whether anyone had checked the lab report. When I did, what I discovered was something that is not so unusual. Allison was 12 weeks into her pregnancy at that time we saw her. When we do an abortion, we always take the remains we have removed and have it tested at the lab. The lab reports showed that the embryo was only nine weeks developed. What this means is that the fetus had died long before Allison ever arrived here in Sweden. Allison didn't have an abortion. She had a miscarriage. A natural miscarriage. REPORTER: What's gonna happen now that the Goldrings are released from Walker Point? My office is preparing an application to the grand jury to get an indictment against Allison Goldring and her mother for attempted fetal murder. Attempted murder is a crime and the Kidnapping Act amended the attempt statute as well as the homicide statute. The indictment will be issued as a matter of course because Allison Goldring has already confessed to the crime. Her confession was on the witness stand and there'll be no necessity for a trial, just sentencing. Allison and her mother will be going back to Walker Point. [GASPS]
