No, I am not Byron, I am another, An unknown elect With a Russian heart, A pilgrim driven by the world. I began early, I'll finish sooner. My mind will not achieve a lot... - Where do I get a pass? - Over there. Sergei BODROV - Thank you. - Which way is it? Take the main lift to the eighth floor.

Go straight down the corridor to the lifts. Then go up one floor. Say hi to Vanya Demidov. From who? - What's your name, handsome? - Danila. - Who was that? - Saltykova. - I didn't catch the name. - Boris. - Hers. - Irina. Irina SALTYKOVA Ilya's been down the stairs 3 times looking for you. Where the hell were you? Guys, we air live in one minute. Move it. Here we go. Someone tell me, if the Chechens've come or not? OK, Vanya. Kirill PIROGOV Quiet on the set. We air in thirty seconds. - Hey, did you host Music News? - That was a long time ago. So the medal-sporting guy is Kostya Gromov, you're Danila Bagrov, and that makes you Ilya Setevoi. Great. Take the sweater off. Don't interrupt me. We're ready. - Who's Irina Saltykova? - What? She's a pop star! Good evening. You're watching The World of People. When in 1996, in Chechnya, Sergeant Kostya Gromov was decorated for bravery, he didn't know it at the time. Today we have here Kostya Gromov and his comrades-in-arms Danila Bagrov and Ilya Setevoi. Dmitry Gromov, a Russian who plays in the American hockey league is Kostya's brother. - What was the decoration for? - It was a cover operation... Alexander DIACHENKO When I came round, I could see the Big Guy. - Who's the Big Guy? - Kostya. So the Big Guy was dragging the two of us with his left hand. In his right hand he had a submachine gun, a Kalashnikov. Blood was pouring out of me, my hip was busted. I could see the Kalashnikov bouncing around, thumping against Danila's head. I thought he was lucky to have the helmet on, as his head was taking a beating. Our guys didn't make it. Here's a photograph. - We're at a rest point. - In the summer. - Which of you's the toughest? - Danila. He was the quickest thinker and he didn't have fear. Hi. Turn on Channel 6. Check out the boy with the thick lips. I'll call you back later. Ray TOLER Now I work in a bank as a security guard. It's a major bank, Nikolaevsky. I like it. The people are real sports there. I'm actually from Kiev. After school I went to my Dad in Tula, and I joined the army soon. And Ilya here works on Red Square. It's the former Lenin Museum. I'm archiving their catalogue. I also work nights as a guard there. That's how I bumped into Danila. I walking outside one morning and he was standing there, looking at the Mausoleum. What do you want to be? Well, I want to enroll in an institute. - Which one? - A medical one to heal people. Really? That's symbolic... Look! Your brother's in Moscow. They show him on TV. And you sit here drinking vodka, you pig. You never help your mother. I'm going to die soon. You'll be fine, Ma. You should go to your brother in Moscow. He'd help you out somehow, you lay-about. He's your brother, after all. Screw him... BROTHER 2 For subscriber 712515. Irina, please phone me on 764 1232. It's Danila. You showed me the way to Channel 6. Demidov says hi. I'll be waiting. - Who's that? - Saltykova. - How did you get the number? - From Demidov. Warrant officer, get us some more cold beers. So Mitya was playing in Kiev for the Falcons. He was drafted by the NHL to play for the Chicago Black Hawks. Can you imagine? Your sib's going to America to play hockey! But the Kiev bad boys got to him. They egged Chicago Ukrainians on him. Their logic was: "We raised you, we gave you money, now it's payback time." The bastards! They're greedy. Mitya knows if you pay once, you pay for life. So he found himself some local protection... an American. Katya, we're talking, OK? The American got it right. He got some people to represent Mitya's interests in the NHL. Loads of agents with contracts to sign. Mitya signed them all and the Ukrainians left him alone. So he played in the first team. knocking the goals in. Not long ago the Pittsburgh Penguins bought him. But all the cash is going into the American's account. Mitya's getting peanuts. Mitya waited and waited until he realized he'd been conned. He goes back to the Ukrainians, but it's too late. The American is like some new Al Capone. He even talks to Mitya through his lawyer. Mitya is a star! - How much does he owe? - 900 grand, American dollars. What about going to the law? There's a contract! Mitya didn't understand English, the idiot. He thought the Americans are more honest than our lot. - Guys, we want some beer. - Later. Now the American's in Moscow. Mitya called me last night. So what do we do? I'll talk to my boss. He's meeting the American tomorrow. Couldn't you talk to the American? You speak English... They wouldn't let me. Like I said he's a new Al Capone. What if he doesn't give it back? I don't know... I can't let my brother down! We're twins, we're always together... I haven't seen him for a year and I already miss him. Listen, who's Al Capone? Come on. He was the biggest gangster in America! Oh, hi! Girls! I just wanted to meet up. Demidov gave me the number. No, he's not here. Kotelnicheskaya? Yes, I know. Bye. - Where's Kotelnicheskaya? - You just said you knew. Reveille! Like they say in the army. Like they said. Hey student, time to get ready for your exams. Can I make a phone call? The boss has arrived. Hi, Mr Belkin, I'm Kostya, the son of Gromov, from Tula. Yes, I remember. What is it? Two years ago you helped my brother. Your partner, Mennis from Chicago, who you asked to look after Mitya, conned him and took all his money... Would you please speak to him? If he won't listen to you, I'll... - You'll what? - I'll speak to him. - To whom? - To Mennis, he's in Moscow. OK, Kostya, I'll talk to him. Irina, do you always watch yourself on TV? - Don't you like it? - Why, it's OK. I like bands like Nautilus or DDT... Move it, I've no time for you. Come on, don't be mad. It's just you don't listen to that kind of music there. - Where? - At war. What war? We're at peace. The rules are different here. This is the kind of music I sing. I really like you, and not because of that. Boris, have you got a coin for the phone? Kostya, how did it go? We'll celebrate in the Metropol. My boss promised to talk to him. Pick me up at six. Over and out! How's the job? Kate, get us some mint tea please. - Mr.Belkin, the tea's ready. - Bring it in. He's busy at the moment, I'll tell him. Take Mr.Mennis to the hotel. Get me the Chief of Security. Fast! Still asleep? It's already five o'clock! You pick up Kostya, I'll come at seven. OK? OK. Over and out. Brake with your legs, not with your head, shitass. A race of freaks. They buy the car and the driving license, but they can't actually drive. Where are you going? You asshole! You should be driving a road-roller! Where do they get money? They probably buy that as well! A country of sheep and goats! You vote for a thin guy, and in a year you're watching some arse-faced hog on TV who tells you how to live. - Where? - Turn right after that building. That's the Taganka Theatre! "After that building" indeed. There were less halfwits in my generation. Can't you tell red from green, you cow? Green - "go", red - "stop"! They used to be sensible people and suddenly they all turned into cretins. Sound the horn. That's not a boat... That'll be 66 rubles. Wait a minute, I'll get my friend. Not even women wait for morons. Police. Murder. 7 Khokhlovsky Street, apartment 4. It's Konstantin Gromov. The body was found by Danila Bagrov. Ilya, Kostya's been killed. Don't call the mobile. Wait at the museum. Chief, can you put the beds down. Gimme us a cig. Hey, blockhead, gimme a light. You deaf, shithead? You hear what the guv said? So, you were planning to enroll at an institute. You came to check out the courses. And you didn't know you've got to register? You can read, can't you? I can hold you for another three days. Is that what you want? - Why did you beat them up? - Give me back my stereo. Nikolaevsky Bank: Founders. Belkin Valentin. We've got to get the rods. Child Belkin Fedya. Studies at Nikolaevsky School. Hello, Fascist. It's Ilya. We need some war spoils. OK. - Heil Hitler. - Hi. - Who's he? - One of us. 'A brother to your own, for better or for worse.' It's a popular fascist saying. I'm Fascist. Danila. - Are you German? - Russian. - My Grandad was killed in the war. - It happens. What can I offer you, gentlemen? Five MPs - four 40s, one a 38. All's tested and in full fighting order. Grenades: anti-personnel. They sometimes misfire. It's a 50-50 chance. Fausts with two rounds haven't been checked. Pistols: four Walthers, one Parabellum. Imported stuff. As for domestic products there's a Degtyarev machine-gun in ideal condition. Four PPSs - they're heavy, but reliable. There's one Tula Tokarev or TT. They get snapped up very quickly. There's one Nagan but it's not very reliable. The firing pin's worn down. I don't suppose you'd be interested in Mosin rifles. Where does all this come from? Echoes of the war. - Where are we going? - To Moscow. Hey, Dan, he's still there. Brother. ...then I went to the Nikolaevsky Bank and asked for Kostya Gromov. Mum had given me the address. One jerk of a guard says no one of that name works here. So, I thought if there's nobody at the museum... no money and your passport's checked on every corner. Lucky I've got my police pants on. Wow! Is it the real thing? From Chapayev's time. - Those were the days! - Let's go to America. Anywhere you say. We need passports and visas, and a good car for a few hours. Brother, you'll help me, OK? Give me a light? You ever get any sleep? My boss is always on the move doing things. He's got a cool car. Is it German? - Who do you want to see? - Fedya Belkin. - He's already arrived. - I'm his brother. I'm late. That's OK, they haven't started. - You can leave it here. - There's a present in here. This concert is dedicated to Students' Day. Fedya Belkin is opening it. He'll be reciting the Students' Poem! "I discovered suddenly I have a big family - "The path and the wood, The corn in the field, "The river, the sky so blue, All is mine and so dear. "It is my Homeland! And I love all who live in it." Hi, Fedya! The poem... You read it very well... I'm your new Russian teacher, Danila Sergeyevich. Valentin Edgarovich. I'm Fedya's Russian teacher. I need to talk to you. Let's go to the staff room. You go to the conference hall. - Who's he? - Our new Russian teacher. "Goodbye, America, "Where I have never been, "Farewell forever..." Keep your hands on the table. That's it. I pull on the trigger, your balls drop down. Frightened? Were you frightened when you were killing Kostya? Kostya? Yes, Gromov. It wasn't me. It was the American. It was him. I couldn't. I know his father. I promised Kostya. I didn't think he'd refuse. He's greedy. Tell me everything about the American. Now! Sorry, I'm talking with a sponsor. Still talking? He's a big man in Illinois. He financed the mayor's election campaign. He's got congressmen in his pocket. He deals in drugs. Owns a string of blues and rock clubs in Chicago. He launders his money through them. His headquarters are in the Metro club. He deals in land and real estate. He's into anything to do with money, like NHL... He orders films in Russia with real rapes and murders and sells them over there. He's very greedy. That explains what happened to Kostya's brother. I... I didn't do it. Big deal, a million. He's got trillions. Don't shoot. You're a reasonable man. Alright, live on scum. Thank your son. It'd be a shame to leave such a nice kid without a father. Sit quiet and let your pants dry out. Don't bother him. He's writing a report to the school board. You should see a doctor. Prostatitis is a tricky business. You won't get a hard-on at the right moment. Give me a break! Why did you kill him, you oaf?! You said - he doesn't mind his business and you don't want to see him. Shitass! And Ilya, he works on Red Square. It's the former Lenin Museum. I'm cataloguing their archive. That's how I bumped into Danila. To the museum, fast! Got to get us new wheels! - I put different plates on. - That bull memorized them. I'll change them again. When'll the passports be ready? Tomorrow or the day after. It's not easy. Yes... He died. Here's the money. My last. When you get the passports buy two tickets to Chicago. We need to scram. Sooner or later they'll trace the museum. And the apartments. - They won't yours. - The cops have got my address. Let's go. Let's take this too. It's a beauty. For subscriber 712515. Irina, call me immediately. Danila. I told you we'd get burnt. Sit quiet, we won't. Your driving license and car papers. Hello. She can't speak right now. She's being filmed for a video. - Is it valid for 10 days? - Hang on... Yes, it is. I'll come over. Where is it? We're going to the TV center. - Have a safe trip. - Goodbye. Wow! Relax. My papers... are in order. Don't worry, pops. We're friends of Ilya's. We'll just take a look at the exhibition. They left an hour ago. Three of them. They took some kind of box. The old guy doesn't remember a fucking thing. Lay an ambush. Start looking for a white Volvo. Get the auto police on the case. Check the airlines: Bagrov, flying to Chicago. Aeroflot will tell me, of course, but not the other airlines. Get a Duma deputy's card or a security service ID. Do I have to spell it out for you? Okay. Cut. That was no good. 25 frames and the whole track. Once again. - How long's it been going on? - Third day already. - I don't envy your job... - There are worse. - Where did you serve? - In the paratroopers. - Did you see any action? - I had a crack at the Afghans. Listen, is there... anything between you and Irina? It's just... well, I really like her. But she sings all that crap. If it was Nautilus or DDT... Maybe you should become a music producer? Maybe I will. But I've got no ear for it. Another four hours. I thought we'd finish sooner. Can I wait for you at home? Boris, give him the key... or a lift. No, I've got a car. Shall I get anything? I'll call you when I wake up. Hey buddy, was that Irina Saltykova? She lives here? Listen, buddy, whose banger is it? No clue. It's not from around here. Have you seen this guy around here? Nope. Saltykova's cool. You screwing her? There's some guys hanging out around the Volvo. - Serious guys. Got your photo. - Cops? - Don't look like cops. - How many? Two by the car. More in the jeep. Can't see how many; tinted windows. One by the doorway. - Thanks, Bob. - Keep Irina out of this. Tired? I'm not alone. My brother Victor's here. He was like a father to me. - Victor Bagrov. - Irina. Pleased to meet you. I don't like Kirkorov. He's too sugary. All that make-up. Powdered like a woman. In a word... a Romanian. - But he's Bulgarian. - He is? What's the difference? Where are you, Ilya? The address is 2 Sadovaya Triumphalnaya. The passports are ready. The flight's tomorrow morning. Move! There's a jeep downstairs and some four fighters. Open the door for me when you're moving. - Ready? - Ready. What are you hanging around here for? Hit the floor! Give my love to Belkin. - That's the first misfire. - Where are we going? I'll drive. He's got a tommy-gun and grenades. Shirya's been hit. Volvo, license number... Get Semyon on the case. Don't let them slip away! Baldie was his school mate. Sava identified him. The cops haven't got anything on him. We're checking his mafia links. A ticket's been booked and paid for an Aeroflot flight to Chicago for Bagrov. Departs on the 22nd. What's the date today? Yes, Belkin speaking. We've transferred the first installment of money to your account according to the new plan... Your partner will receive it in good time. Good, Konstantin Alexeyevich. - Is everything OK? - Yes, thank you, excellent. We hear you're having problems... I solve my problems myself. - Goodbye. - All the best. We can't get away from them, brother. We'll make it. Dan, turn to some quiet spot and brake when I tell you. Fascist wasn't kidding. That's for you. Moscow to Chicago, 9am. You fly to New York two hours later. Don't argue. It'll be better that way. You buy a car for $500 on Brighton Beach and in 12 hours you're in Chicago. Fly back four days later. Why so quickly? You meet here. That's Lake Michigan, the fourth bridge... There's a bench there. I illegally hooked up Kostya's mobile to roaming. Take this. Use it if you have to. There's 250-300 dollars left on it. The code is 3232. Victor Bagrov, you're going to the conference on new computer technologies. Danila Bagrov, I don't know where you're flying to. I'll spend a couple of hours roaming on the internet. Is it the real thing? Well... almost. When you're go going through passport control look confident and smile. That's about all. - Well, see you there, brother. - Freedom to Angela Davis! It's been a long time since I kissed in an entrance hall. - Have you ever been to America? - Yes. - What's it like? - Nothing special. I've never been abroad. You haven't missed much. Why did you bring me here? - It's beautiful. - Let's go to my place. My train leaves in an hour. Call me, OK? - Are you going to America? - Of course not. To Tula. Just dial without any code, like in Moscow. Okay. I won't be long. Only four days. He's dead. Let's go inside. - Who's dead? - My friend. He wasn't there! He couldn't have slipped through! Boss, we've checked it. - Has Bagrov registered? - Yes. - Did all passengers board? - Yes. What are you taking me for? Who is flying to Chicago? Could I have another glass of juice? Right, guys, this is Danila Bagrov. We have to meet him at the airport and quietly get rid of him. Good people asked us to help the Muscovites out. Information on filling immigration forms can be found in your entry visa. What? No... I don't understand. What is the purpose of your visit to the USA? It's a... conference on new computer technologies. How long will you stay in the USA? Four days. It's written there. Here's the return ticket. - Where will you be staying? - At a hotel. It's written in the invitation. Morons... - Have you got fat or apples? - Why? Do you have any food? Apples? Pork fat? Don't they sell them here? You don't understand. This is quarantine! Are you ill? - Hey, how do I get to town? - By taxi. Fellow countryman, where do the Russians live? Russians aren't my countrymen. You a Nazi collaborator? Okay guys, see you around! You got a problem. The Ukrainians say he wasn't on the plane. Just like I said. The bad boys gave us the dope on Baldie. He's called Tartar. He's a contract killer. Worked in St. Petersburg. Bumped off some kingpins and disappeared. It turns out he joined the police force to sit it out. He was on that plane. That means they've hired him and Bagrov didn't go. Reinforce my bodyguard! Look for Bagrov and that museum guy. Check who he was staying with in that building where we found the Volvo, and post a watch there. Send the Ukrainians a photo of Baldie, er... Tartar. They've got to find him. New York Film Festival. - Where to? - Brighton Beach. - How much? - 45 bucks. - Can't you give me a break? - I can't. This one. Hello. - Brighton Beach. - What are you shouting for? - Oh, I thought you didn't speak Russian. Think less, use your brains. You're not in Russia anymore. Those jerks are dying to have a look! - What was it? - Another jerk. - You mean me? - Who else? - Why the hell d'you come here? - To see how people live. I know your type. I've been driving for a long time. First you live with friends, then you rent an apartment, then wherever the bent-up American dream would take you. You're wrong. I love my homeland. A patriot! The Russian Idea! Dostoyevsky! The Homeland! Where's your homeland, son? Gorbachev sold it out to the Americans for the highlife. Your homeland screwed up two wars and Crimea. Sold out Russians in the Baltics and the Serbs. Your homeland is wherever your backside is warmest! You know it. That's why you are here. Have you got a brother in Moscow? What are you gaping at, dopey? Get a move on. Meet my friend. - Danila. - Kuibyshev. Oh, Moscow, Moscow... Russia. Come along then, young fellows. Don't pay attention to the exterior. She's got an engine that goes like my Sonya! - She could take you to Kiev. - Will she make it to Chicago? Even to San Francisco and back! We Russians don't rip off one another. Hi, where are you? I'm stuck near Tula. My car's broken down! - How are you doing? - Fine. Can you drop in today? No, not today. Call again! A new Russian. Called Tartar. What an ugly mug! They've got all kinds in Moscow. I saw him at the airport. The dog called me a Nazi collaborator. Post a round-the-clock watch at the Metropol where the Russians hang out. Remember that hockey guy Gromov? He came to us before. They might meet up there. - And what about this one? - Throw it away. I don't understand a fucking word. You're breaking the Illinois state law. You can't drink alcohol in public. Your ID, please. Bullshit. Everyone's doing it. Over there by the shop. Their bottles are in paper bags. I don't see them drinking. But you are drinking in public. Your passport or license please. You are under arrest. - Give the passport back. - You are under arrest. - Accompany me to the police car. - Fuck you. - I'm a policeman. - I'm a policeman too. Screw you bastards. - Wait! You're Russian? - What do you want? Wait, take this. - What's your name? - Marilyn. - And your Russian name? - Dasha. I'm Danila. He's calling you. Stop! Stop! He was at Saltykova's. - Saltykova? - Irina, the singer! You know - "blue eyes, blue eyes". He was with her. So, do we beat it out of her? - Who? - Saltykova. Khakin, if I hadn't known you for 12 years, I'd have you... She's a star! The whole of Moscow knows her! "Beat it out of her"! Bug her. - We'll catch him by telephone. - Right. Hello, Mitya! It's Danila from Moscow, Kostya's friend. Mitya, pick up the phone. I need to see you. I've got important news from Kostya. Mitya, it's Danila from Moscow What's the fuss? Mitya! Pick up the phone! It's Danila from Moscow. Hi! I'd given up hope of getting through to you. We have to meet up. It's for your sake. Kostya asked me to see you. They killed him. No, not on the phone. - No. He won't give it back! - Don't worry about it. Tell me where he lives and I'll sort it out. - Come on, time to start. - Coming, coming. That's Mennis' office, I don't know where he lives. - Listen, maybe I could... - get a move on. - This is my friend from Moscow. - Hi, I'm Darius. - Danila. Pleased to meet you. - Don't interrupt his training. Listen, can I crash round at yours? Look, I've got a new girlfriend. She wouldn't understand. - Can you lend me some money? - How much? Say, three hundred dollars. I don't carry cash. I've got it on credit cards. I'll have a look, I might have about 20 bucks. What's the English for "manganese"? Who's after me, you Nazi henchman? Don't kill me. It's Kobonya the Squint Eyes. The Russians asked us to kill the bald Tartar. - Where's Kobonya? - The Lvov Restaurant. You'll pay for Sevastopol yet, you pigs! Hi. Yes, in Moscow. Now? I'm in Biriulevo. I'll be finished in a couple of days. Call me, OK? Remember that night on the roof? He's in Biriulevo. Who do we have there? Send all the boys there. Close off all the roads! Dasha! Dasha! Over here. What do you want? Haven't you had enough of a beating? Hi. Make it quick. Russians don't desert their own at war. What's that? What? What war? Have you gone mad? Wait, I've got to buy a gun. Help me. - What for? - I need it. - You got any dough? - Yes. I need an automatic pistol with a thirty-round clip. Well, if you're lucky... Two hundred bucks for me. Deal. Translate, I don't understand English. - Two grand. Show the money. - Tell him to show me the gun. Two for both of them or for just one? For one. Show the money. It's dark in here. I told you, I've come for you. It's all over. Do you know this poem? "I discovered I have a big family, "And the path and the woods And the corn in the field, "The river, the sky so blue - It's all mine and so dear. "My Homeland! "I love all on this Earth!" Is there a back way out of here? Hi! What are you up to? I'm running! Mr.Belkin, we've transferred the money. We're up and running, as they say. Your reputation and your word speak for themselves. But you are having problems. Like I said, I sort out - You don't take chances with this kind of money. - What does "how are you" mean? - It means "how are you". - Do they really mean it? - No, they don't. - Then why do they ask? - They just ask for free. Everything's for free here, except money. I'm hungry. Look, crawfish climb out right onto the pier and no one bothers to catch them. - Maybe he isn't coming? - He'll come. Brother... Eight years is a long time. I wasn't even twenty then. University, Perestroika, America, Coca-Cola. Got married, then got divorced. I worked for an escort service in New York. Then coke, crack. Came to Chicago with one fattie. He dumped me. Then I got mixed up with that black jerk. Oh, one shouldn't speak ill of the dead. Anyway, it's all boring and dull. You know the last time I had fun was in 1984. We went camping at Glukhoe Lake... Come home with us. It's OK there. - And what will I do there? - What are you doing here? I like it here. All power in the world's in America! - What's power, brother? - It's in the money, brother. Money rules the world. Whoever has the most is the strongest. OK, you've got the lot. So what would you do? - I'd buy everyone. - Even me? What does he want? Some crawfish? What do you want? Dirt. He says the food's dirty. Crawfish eat the dirt. We shouldn't eat them. What? Dirt? Look at you. Black as scum. You need a good scrub! Get lost! - Leave him. Get going, negro. - You shouldn't have called him a negro. - He's an Afro-American. - What's the difference? Nigger sounds offensive to them. That's what I was taught at school. Chinamen live in China, Germans in Germany, Jews in Israel and Negroes in Africa. I think the power's in them. There's something primordial and animal in them. We lost it, that's why they're stronger. Whites know it and they're afraid of them. Those bastards didn't even let us eat crawfish. He's at the Metro Club and he'll be back late. Don't bother waiting. He's jobbed you. Maybe something happened. I think he's just a jerk. He's my brother! OK, let's go see Mennis. Where's Mennis? Where's Mennis? "I discovered I have a big family "And the path and the woods, And the corn in the field, "The river, the sky so blue - It's all mine and so dear, "My Homeland!" ...a big family, "And the path and the woods, And the corn in the field. "The river, the sky so blue - It's all mine and so dear..." "My Homeland. I love all on this Earth!" That's great. Ah, Russian vodka! Good. American, what's power? Is it really money? My brother says it's money. You've got lots of money - so what? Power is in truth. Whoever is right is strong. You cheat someone out of his money. Does that make you stronger? No, 'cos you don't have truth on your side. And the person you cheated has. That means he's stronger. Oh yeah? Sure. Dmitry Gromov, gimme money. So, play hockey. Will my new earnings go to Mennis' account as before? Tell them to pay it into yours. - But the contract? - Forget about it. Interest too. So like your brother... Give up, Russian! Russians never give up! What's going on here? A Russian shot down Ukrainian Mafiosi last night at the Lvov restaurant. I bet it'll be tear gas next. - How do you know? - Don't you watch the movies? I'm staying! I'm staying! I'm going to live here. How do you say "I need help"? Hang on. Dasha, come over here. Registration is over. Where's the second passenger? Hi, I'll be back tomorrow. Order a table for four at the Metropol. Hey, boy. Tell Boris I'm bringing him a present. Get us some vodka. Sorry, we don't serve drinks during take-off. Boy, you don't understand! Bring us some vodka. We're flying home! Oh, I see. I'll be right back.
