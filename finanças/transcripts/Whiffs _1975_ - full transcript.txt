[bugle call] Attention! Sit. Good morning, gentlemen. You men have been carefully chosen from many applicants to advance your careers in this top security highly classified and totally misunderstood Department of the United States Defense's effort. You have all successfully and without fear of the unknown.. ...courageously.. ...subjected yourselves to tests A common cold, polio, diphtheria, the Hong-Kong flu Montezuma's revenge, dysentery. Oh, I can go on and on and on. Today you're moving up. Graduating to a new level in your careers. The opportunity to be part of the test of chemical warfare's newest gas developments. You'll be able to prove.. [airplanes swooshing] ...Department of Defense United States Army Joint Chiefs of.. [swooshing] [sighs] That damned Air Force. You are going to help prove to the Department of the Defense the United States Army, the Joint Chiefs of Staffs to the entire world.. ...that we, the Chemical Corp are the champions of the only form of humane warfare. We don't want to kill the enemy. We just want to make him a little sick. Now, I want you to meet.. ...a soldier of soldiers, pride of the Chemical Corp. This man has given 15 years of dedicated unselfish, loyal service to humanity. Private Dudley Frapper. [clapping] [applause] It is indeed a privilege and a great honor to serve you the United States Armed Forces and our country, sir. [applause] And today, this man.. ...will be the first to participate in the testing of the newest and the most effective gas ever created. GZS-II. Which some irresponsible journalists have already sarcastically named&quot;The Red Death.&quot; But what we in chemical warfare would prefer to call&quot;Happy Dreams.&quot; So, today, Private Frapper will once again make his contribution. 'A giant contribution to peace for all mankind.' [applause] [bangs] [comical music] [music continues] [airplane swooshing] [music continues] [man sighing] 'Isn't that wonderful? Look at that, it's perfect.' - 'Perfect!' - 'This is not to smile at.' I'm smiling because the test is a success. It is not. He should have lost motor control by the time he reached the outer circle. - He did! - He did not. I want another test. Alright. Frapper will be ready in two days. I don't know about Frapper. He's getting chemically imbalanced. Developing certain immunities. He doesn't look immune to me. [Dudley groaning] [coughing] Excuse me, sir. Then I, I lost.. ...control of my elbow joints. Couldn't raise my arms. My knees went next. [indistinct] I was nauseous. - Choking. - Excellent. 'My vision was all blurry, minimum.' My nose was running. [coughs] You haven't eaten, private. No appetite, ma'am. Appetite is unimportant. This is part of the chemical experiment. Now eat. My taste buds are shot. Everything tastes the same, flat. Your vision was impaired, partially blurring? Oh, yeah. Uh, I was nearly unconscious. And my body was twitching. And then.. ...a very peculiar thing happened, sir. - I got an erection. - 'Good man.' (Dudley) 'I-I haven't had any one of those for two years' due to the decontamination. - Scrub team noticed it? - I don't know. Let me see if it's here. What do you think caused that, sir? Well, that gas probably affected your involuntary muscles which controls your blood vessels. So, on a.. the condition you described to me was just a pack of spongy tissue, that's all. Spongy tissue? [wheezing] - Colonel Sir. - How is Frapper? Well? Good progress. - Thank you, sir. - Colonel. Well, I hope his condition is satisfactory? Can we gas him tomorrow? He's gas-able. Uh-huh. Sir. I recommend that Private Frapper not be used for any test proboscis for at least two weeks. Give him a chance to build up his strength. Well, I suppose we'll let Private Frapper then decide when he's ready. How did the...the film on GZS test go, sir? I loved it. I loved it. He's the cream of the Chemical Corp. (Dudley) 'Oh, thank you, sir. I love my work.' It's challenging-- Now you talk about challenge. There's another experiment I need you on. The new nerve gas variation. The Pinto model? Gran Torino. Wow! I can.. ...hardly wait to.. [wheezing] ...try that one, sir. - Dudley. What do you say? - Hey, there, Chops. I didn't know you were with me on this. Yeah. How about that? I thought you preferred the bacterial archidose. I...no, I got sick and tired of having the bubonic plague all the time, you know. What the hell is all this shit? Oh, it's a combination of a mustard gas and a new nerve agent. [ringing] This is the skin test. Oh. [whirring] [groans] [whirring] Oh. [Dudley screams] They're running dysentery over in lab 12. You should've volunteered for it. Oh, no kidding. I didn't know that. Damn it. [groaning] I'd love the dysentery test, you know? But, uh, the colonel said that if I did this one it would, uh, you know speed up my, speed up my speed up my p-parole. Never did ask you why they put you in prison? Armed robbery. 'How much time did you get?' Uh-uh, seven, seven the ten. If they let me go after this one it'll mean I served four. I sprained his neck. What you think he'll do when you get out? I don't know. How much longer are you-you gonna be in the army? I've done 15 years already. Another five, I'm eligible to my retirement. You-you, you gonna put up this shit five more years? More actually, you see.. I'm-I'm, I intend to be a thirty-thirty year man. Um, no.. It must be nice to be able to...plan your life that away. The army's been very good to me. [mumbling] Gives me a sense ofsecurity. [mumbling] Security? You gotta be... out of your freaking mind. Think of.. [mumbling] [groaning] What kind of future is this? Think of it.. ...as acontribution topeace in theworld. [comical music] Order number one! Ready! Load! Fire! [explosion] 'Order number two.' 'Ready!' 'Load!' 'Fire!' [explosion] 'Order number three.' 'Ready! Load!' 'Fire!' [explosion] [comical music] (male #1) 'Shouldn't have been tipping yet. The mask is defective.' (male #2) 'It's not the mask, it's Dudley Frapper.' 'He's ruining my tests.' He's too unstable. Frapper is stable. I want him out of the chemical program. Now, he can cause millions of dollars worth of mistakes. Frapper does not make mistakes. Do you want to take the responsibility? Eh. [groaning] - Discharge? - 'For medical reasons.' What do you mean medical re-reasons.. ...sir? Here's the medical report. Reads like the kindest thing we could do for you would be to put you to sleep. But, sir, I don't want a discharge. I wish the Chemical Corps had a thousand more like you. [wheezing] Only healthy. Sir, transfer me into another branch. The Green Berets. Frapper, when you are out, you are out. Out of the entire army. Sir, I'm-I'm, I'm due for my pension in five years, sir. [grunts] Couldn't you find me a job on the base? Anything, so I can hang around for another five years. The army, Frapper, is not a place to hang around. [coughing] [Frapper wheezing] [coughs] Look, on the positive side.. Don't overlook the tremendous contribution you've made to this program. You got any idea how many mice and rats, birds, uh, guinea pigs rabbits, monkeys, beagles.. ...have been spared because of you? I couldn't even approximate, sir. The army doesn't approximate. The army knows exactly. And the army shows it's appreciation by taking care of it's own. You may not be getting a pension but you're getting something better. Disability payments. [clears throat] I never.. ...thought of myself as being disabled, sir. Then think disabled! The adjudication committee ruled you 30 percent disabled. Every month Dr. Sam is gonna send you a whopping cheque for $77. That isn't very much, sir. Frapper.. ...you like spaghetti? - I used to, sir. - Mm-hmm. Won't $77 each month buy you one hell of a lot of spaghetti? More than I need, sir. Get yourself a job, the 77 is marinara sauce. Sir, my 30 percent disability takes into account impaired vision, hearing, lungs. - 'Things like that.' - That's correct. But does it take into consideration my hair-loss, sir? I don't see how a couples of patches of bare skull's gonna disable you. What I'm saying, sir, is when I entered the service I had a completely normal healthy head of hair. And due to service connected activities patches are falling out, I have this permanent shock I feel entitled to an additional one percent disability. Alright, the army will provide you with GI-wig. How about my loss of appetite, sir? Every food tastes the same. How about one percent for my taste buds? Taste buds? Hm. Well, I have to research that one. It's due to biological experiments, colonel. I have suffered from anthrax, malaria blastomycosis, cryptomycosis 'collar, glanders, rickets' parrot fever, rabbit fever, shingles, yellow jack, sheep-- 'Okay, okay.' Geez! - How much you want for the lot? - Twenty percent, sir. I'm sure the navy would give me twenty-five. The army will give you ten. Go fifteen. Twelve is top. You got yourself a good deal, sir. Alright, shall we add up the package here? Well, I have one more item, sir, and it's a rather large one which is not exactly the best way to describe it. What is the best way? Impotent, sir. What? Impotence. You oughta be ashamed of yourself. Trying to claim a sexual disability! I mean, if you had a shot off. Or if you were a real stud when you enlisted I'd be the first to give you a 100 percent disability. For all I know, you're queer. [Frapper wheezing] Oh-oh-oh, I'm sorry. I apologize. Okay. We'll accept it. You had reasonable sexual horse power when you enlisted and somewhere along the highway of chemical and biological warfare your crankshaft cracked. So, put this package together, uh, see what we got? We're talking about.. ...twelve percent for that medley diseases. One percent hair-loss. Well, alright, one for taste buds. I'll give you.. ...six for your dead dick. 'That's 20 percent.' 'And plus 30, that's up to a grand total of 50 percent.' That's a 149 smackers a month. For a single guy? Thank you, sir. Uh, Frapper, how many times have you been on the brink of death? So many times, sir, I stopped counting. Uh-huh, and how many times have we managed to pull you out of it? - A similar amount I think, sir. - Uh-huh. Personnel into the thousands. Doctors, nurses, decontamination crews have saved your life again and again and again. Ad nauseam, you'd be dead without them. Frapper.. You owe us. I agree, sir. Your disability is hereby readjusted to 40 percent in their honor. That's a $106 a month, non-taxable. Plus, permanent out-patient status. You'll be coming out on the base every week for shots and study. Plus, all medicine and drugs. Plus, burial allowances and a grave-marker. Plus, a GI-wig, that will have every whore in Salt Lake city chasing after you. Let's face it, soldier, you've got it made. [patriotic music] Frapper.. I'm gonna miss you. Oh, that's very gratifying, sir. Thank you, sir. Well, I'm gonna miss seeing you out there, you know. Out in the field and.. [laughs] Well, a cloud of gas comes and settles on you and you.. ...you do that wonderful little dance, you know. [melancholic music] Don't you feel any bitterness? Oh, I don't know. I guess I'll know better when I step outside the gates. What kind of job are you looking for? Well, something challenging and interesting. I'm thinking of buying a van and doing some hauling. Well, I've got a month's leave coming. I hope you get settled. Thanks, Scottie. But I can handle that myself. It was a terrific life. I guess I am bitter. What kind of work was it that you did in the Chemical Corps? Oh, it-it was highly classified work. I can't talk about it. [wheezes] Well, ah, if you want to find the same kind of work here you'll have to tell me what it was. Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am. My allegiance is to the US of A. [wheezes] 'If you could just tell me what openings you have' I could tell you which one's.. [wheezes] ...I could fill. [wheezes] Why don't you fill out this application form over there at the table? Over there? [military music] [grunting] [coughing] [Dudley mumbling] [Dudley groaning] What happened? Jus-jus-just a slight ca-ca-case of ma-ma-ma-malaria. [groaning] This is not my size. You're hurting my little toe. Please close your mouth. [coughing] Listen, you're spreading germs all over the place. Please cover your mouth. [coughing] Ooh...eh.. Let-let go. - Shoo. - It's over. It's okay. [coughing] [groaning] (man on radio) 'This is KOSL FM, Salt Lake City.' [&quot;Now That We're In Love&quot;] * Now that we're in love * * The world's a lovelier place * * Now that we're in love * * It has a smile on it's face * [engine revving] * Every night * * Each day is Valentine's Day * Well done. Take care of yourself. And, uh, you'll have to lay off dairy. Dudley, one before breakfast and one after dinner. * You sigh and violins play * * Now that you're * Got to get your case reviewed. I mean, you can't even hold a job. They're going to pay for what they've done to you. Boy, guess they're more bitter about this than me. I've been on the verge of death so many times I learn to take it as it comes. Well, don't. There's taking, and then there's taking. And they are taking advantage of you. If they don't give you what you deserve you mustdemandit. Oh, you know me. I'm not that kind of person. * Shangri-La, Eden * * Yes heaven and paradise too * I have a pass for this weekend. And I'm gonna be bringing something very special. And I'm sure.. Lieutenant Hallam, you're needed. You're due for an upswing. [knock on door] (Dudley) 'Advance and be recognized!' Oh! Ooh! You're recognized. Guess what. What? Ta-dah! - For me? - For you. N2O? Nitrogen Monoxide? L-laughing gas. What's the matter? My condition isn't funny enough? &quot;The Dental Journal&quot; says that in some cases it stimulates sexual hallucinations. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. I don't want a sexual hallucination. I want a hard-on. [moaning] I sure miss those gases. I just want you to relax. Don't breathe too heavily or you'll pass out. You didn't take any. I don't wanna waste any on me. Ooh-oo-ooh! [chuckling] Oh, it's goodie! Ha ha ha! Oh. Oh, if I could just get it all together I would give it.. ...all...to you. Please take some. - Please. - Alright. 'I'm so relaxed and loose' I just want you to feel like me. [laughing] How much.. [chuckles] ...passionate now? Passionate? I am passionate. God, honey, I got a hot news flash for you. I got news coming over the wire. This stuff doesn't work. This doesn't do nothing. [chuckles] [blows raspberry] [laughing] Aah! Ah, I'm gonna-you.. ...get some of this is in. - Scottie, you.. - No. ...you get yourself all gassed up too-- No, no. Come on, come on, come on. - No, I'm going to bed. - Come on. - Oh. - Come on, come on. No more. No! No. [chuckling] I still love you. [solemn music] (Phil) 'Closin' up.' Time for a fast one? If you'll gulp it down. Yeah. Uh.. What do you have for somebody who's, uh.. [wheezes] ...not supposed to drink? I got a door and a steel toe in my shoe. Can I please have a glass of water? It's.. Drink up! Okay. [cash register dings] Chops? Chops. Well, do you have to yell my name so loud? - How are you? - I'm fine. Tops, tops. Where's your uniform? Oh, I'm out. Medical discharge. - You got a job? - No. You got one? Yeah, well, sort of. You glad you're out? Sure. Only thing is, I'm having a little difficult time trying to get myself together, you know? Yeah, I know the feeling. I've been betrayed by the army and rejected by civilian life among other personal problems. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, Dudley. But look, I don't wanna talk to you anymore. Now, will you take off? Why not? Uh, in police terms, there's a robbery in progress. Are you a cop? No, I'm the perpetrator. Now, will you get outta here? I don't want you to get in any trouble. Chops, don't do it. I can't help it. I'm all keyed up. Hey, it's gulp time. You too, Mac. Don't make me throw you out. Oh, why don't you shut up, you big bully. Who the hell do you think you are, anyway? - Don't. - Huh? You wanna throw me out from over here? Or you want me to jump over so you can try to throw me out from over there? Decisions, decisions. - Chops, don't. - Na, don't worry about it. He's gonna shit in his pants when he sees this. Alright, come on. Face down on the ground. Hands behind your head. Wow! Look at that thing go. That gun could have gone off. It could have hurt somebody. Don't you know anything about guns? - Now get out! - I was only kidding. What's the matter with you? Don't be so stupid. Sir, wait. He didn't mean that. This man is an actor. He's with the Royal Salt Lake City Shakespeare Company. And he's just getting into his character for his role in the &quot;Merry Wives Of Windsor,&quot; which is a funny play. 'And it's dirty, it's dirty.' Would you like some passes for the wife and kids? I just want one pass, at his head. Now, wait, I was only kidding. Look, he's telling you the truth. You see this guy Winsom.. Louie Winsom from the Delancey Street. Anyway, he's kind of a Robin Hood, you know? He's an ex-con and he gets parole. And he winds up in his barn, where he meets a lot of strange people. 'Anyway, he meets the servant with a wife. I forget his name.' Who introduces to all the other wives. And that's how they become &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor.&quot; [grunting] - Yeah, yeah! - Ow! You hissing me or blowing your schnoz. [mumbles] I was blowing my schnoz.. Wait a minute, why can't we sit and talk this over? Come on. [laughing] [laughing] You silly ass. [laughing] Hissing me. [laughing] What the hell are you doing? Just telling my friend blow his nose. I'm gonna blow his nose with this. [all laughing] [comical music] You crazy guys! [laughing] Hissing me. [laughing] Crazy. [mumbling] [snoring] What the hell is that stuff? [mumbling] Anesthetic, he'll wake up.. Oh, terrific. [snoring continues] What are you doing? [laughs] [cash register dings] I'm completing a very smooth robbery. Oh! Armed robbery. [snoring] Sixty three clams. We made a killing. Listen, you know? I owe you. Now, because if it wasn't for you that guy would have messed me up. So we're gonna split this. Thirty-one for me. Thirty-one for you. Okay? And one dollar for the coffee, donuts and a tip. What.. well, come on. Take it, don't stare at it. I mean, you need it as bad as I do, right? Right. I'll never forget that bartender's laugh for the rest of my life. [chuckles] I can't wait to tell the guys in San Quentin about this one. Hope that's not too soon. Hey, Dud. You think you can get any more of that gas? I can get anything I wanted dug up. You know, I-I was just thinking that maybe we could pull another job with it, you know? Look at this. But that's not really the right gas, is it? It just knocks out one person at a time. Well, how about a gas that knocks out a couple of people at the same time? It depends how fast you wanna knock 'em out. Well, knock 'em out fast. I mean, the worse that can happen is they'd throw up, right? I mean, what's wrong with that? You gotta know what you're doing when you're working with gas. Dudley, you're talking to a two-man operation here. One handles the gas, the other one handles the money. I like it, it's beautiful, it's perfect. And it works. Wait a minute. I'm a veteran. I'm not a crook. Oh, is that what you think I am? A crook? A guy who is gassed with you, who is diseased with you. I'm sorry. All I want to do is an earn an honest living. Of course you do and so do I. But they won't let you. Dudley, Dudley, the army is screwing you. Everybody is screwing you. So how about screwing them back? You're the second person who said that to me. I mean, we're not gonna mow 'em down like Barney and Clyde. We're just gonna hit 'em with some poison gas, that's all. Look, Dudley. I know how you feel about pleasin' humanity and-and-and that-and that chemical warfare shit. But this will give you a chance to prove it works. Well, I wouldn't wanna see anybody hurt or permanently injured. That's the beauty of gas. No guns, no violence. No guns, no violence? Or else I won't do it. Okay. Non-violent crime has just taken a big step forward. Okay. They were a couple of sick-looking punks. Oh, there's all kinds of sick. Let's narrow it down. Sick in the head, or sick in the body? Or is that too narrow for you? Head. They were kinda crazy. Oh, wait a minute. There's a whole wide range of crazy. If I had an hour, I could present you with a whole list of crazinesses. Maybe you can save me some time. Everything they did seemed funny. Never laughed so hard in my life. Pair of jokers, huh? Gonna put that through the computer. Hoods with a sense of humor. Got pains in my chest and side. They roughed you up? From laughing. One of them was hissing me. - Hissing? - Yeah. Right in my ear. What a silly guy. Oh, hissing is a whole other field. So vast, that it hasn't been explored. Shall we? Hiss. Hiss. No. Like this. - Hiss. - Hiss. It ain't as funny when you do it. [&quot;Now That We're In Love&quot;] * Suddenly in Disneyland * * Now that we're in love * [dramatic music] - All clear, George. - Okay, Dudley. [tires screeching] [indistinct chatter] [coughing] [dramatic music] [groans] Service is lousy. [dramatic music] [coughing] Hey, don't let anybody leave without paying the check. [coughing continues] [whistling] Come on, let's go, let's go. (Chops) 'Twenty seven, twenty eight, twenty nine, thirty' 'thirty one, thirty twodollars!' [laughing] Hey, Dud. How about this one for a big number, huh? Let's see, $5382. Half of that comes to, half of that comes to, uh, 5000.. I almost breathe some of the gas in my lungs. I wretched in my mask, it felt good. Uh, well-well, anyway this is what I call a big haul. I love gas. I love gas, you love gas. Everybody's got gas. Do you realize that we have successfully launched a gas attack which no army has accomplished since World War I. I'd follow you through this kind of combat, anytime. Hey, why don't we declare war on a bank? War? Wars have been lost because commanders have chosen the wrong time and place to fight. I shall pick the proper battleground for us. [coughing] Now, if anyone saw anything out of the ordinary. Please, speak up. Sir. Sir, look, I-I know this is gonna sound crazy. Yeah. But I can swear I saw a couple ofmonsters. They were sitting right back there. They had big round glassy eyes with the big fat snouts. And the snouts, they were like.. they were like, tin cans. I wish I had a stenographer to get this accurately. This is a major break in the case. Glass eyes and metal snouts. There's nothing like a positive identification. I'll put out an all-points bulletin right away. Glass eyes and metal snouts. How come you haven't pumped her in the stomach so far? Because we're not treating her for food poisoning it's the respiratory system. They're suffering from gas poisoning. You mean the kind in here? I mean the kind you fellows use for riot control, uh.. ...an incapacitator. Sir, could it be that you didn't actually see monsters? Could it be that you saw gas masks? Round glass eyes and a tin snout. - Hmm? - Definitelymonsters. Colonel Lockyer will be with you in a minute. - Please be seated. - Thank you. [distant chanting] [door opens] - Morning, sir. - Morning, colonel. I'm Detective Sgt. Poultry. Nice to see you. - Have a seat. - Thank you. Well, what can I do for you, sir? Colonel, there's a case I'm working on. Night before last, a Salt Lake City restaurant was robbed of payroll and proceeds. Customers and personnel were overcome by what doctors describe as a form of poison gas. No-no, don't say poison. That sounds terrible. Well, according to a description by a bad witness the job was pulled off by two men wearing gas masks. - Gas masks? - 'Mm-hmm.' The gas was colorless, odorless tasteless, invisible. 'All of a sudden, people started' 'sort of losing their coordination.' 'Shaking, trembling, passing out.' Remarkable. What about casualty recovery? - A hundred percent. - Ooh, bravo! That's sound like a tactically perfect operation. I'd put those men up for a special citation. I'd like to give them a citation too. That's why I need your help. Colonel, can we start with the list of your men who had passes that night? Detective Sgt. Poultry. Every time some civilian walks through the street with smelly feet we're accused of letting go, with some poison gas. [intense music] That's it. Uh-huh. There's a bank down there? There's two banks down there. Two! Mmm, nice to have a choice. We take them both. How are we gonna do that? By launching a gas attack on the entire city. [dramatic music] Listen, what I wanna know is where are all the cops gonna be while we're robbing the joint? All over. Either unconscious or sick they should be absolutely defenseless. We oughta be able to walk in and walk right out again. Well, uh, you think maybe we oughta go in and cash a big billion to case the joint? Sure. Yeah. You, uh, you got any money on you? [Dudley coughs] Good morning. [coughing] [wheezing] I want a change of $20. - Are you alright? - Yes, yes. Can I help you, sir? Glass of water, please. [coughing] Okay. Okay, now I've got everything up to this point. But what I wanna know is, how the hell are we gonna attack the whole city? [engine revving] [tires screeching] (Chops) 'Kill many bugs today?' Yeah. Thousands. Maybe, a million. Maybe millions. Beautiful. Now, aren't you gonna ask me about, uh.. the poison that is gonna be consumed by the people who eat the crop, that I dusted? Well, we're not really interested in knowing that. Aren't you a couple of 'em organic food freaks? No, not us. We eat anything. And in lousy restaurants, too. (Dudley) 'We happened to see you dusting' 'a field a few miles from here.' It was just great. I especially love the way you,pull up before the end of each round. That's great. No, no, we're not here to criticize you. We're your fans. Oh. Well, uh.. Thanks. Gee, you know, I'm sorry I jumped down on you. You know, but.. I tell ya, I'm so used to those organic ecology freaks coming around here jeering me. You know, they picketed my runway one day. Signs, and all. It didn't stop me. When I do a job I do a job. I mean, I never overlap a row. I'm always correct, precise, and on target, gentlemen. That's our man. Yeah. [laughing] Name's Dusty. Guess, you wonder where I got that nickname from, eh. I'll have to think about that. Uh, Dusty, I'm George Smith. This is my associate John Jones. Hey, Dusty. Guess how we got our names. [laughing] All kidding aside, Dusty uh, we're executives for &quot;Killz-All&quot; products. A subsidiary of one of the nation's leading chemical houses. - Insecticides, pesticides. - Bed bugs, roaches. - 'Herbicide.' - And Silverfish too. We've landed a whopping new contract. A lot of money to it. (Dudley) 'From the city of Tuela' 'we are gonna spray the whole city' 'with a newly developed insecticide.' 'It'll be a one shot all-purpose deal' 'and we want you.' Well, we'll give you a cash retainer now 'and I'd like to check out your airplane' 'to see what modifications might be necessary' which, naturally, we'll pay for. Oh, cash. Uh, uh.. You could paint, uh, &quot;Killz-All&quot; all over the wings and the fuselage. Uh, if you wanna. I mean, it's good advertising. It's a wonderful idea. That.. we'll pay extra for that too. I think we better take that up with our Advertising Manager. No, I don't think he's gonna like that. I mean, he goes for jingles. [metal thunks] Come back again in two weeks. Cancel it. I'm leaving town. Oh? When? In about a week.. ...for permanent. Are you telling me that this is the last time I'm gonna see you? I'm afraid so. I'm gonna be very busy. Very busy? Busy at what? Doing a lot of things. Working. Planning on how to make good use out of my practical knowledge. You'd be proud of me if you knew the extent of my activities. I've always been proud of you. Please, don't say things like that. It's hard enough to say goodbye. Well, then, don't say goodbye. Look, I love you, I believe in you. You don't have anything to prove to me. We have a future together if you want it. Look, I know you have more to offer me than anything I could plan. I'm just committed and I have to follow through with that. [door opens] See all these bombs under my ship? Reminds me of World War II. Oh, I can't wait until I get over the target. Gives me chills. Oh, how come all these tanks are from the army? Oh, it's part of a big surplus deal we made. We haven't had a chance to repaint them and put our own trademark art. Yeah, you see, our trademark is a roach lying on it's back with it's legs going like that. What's this? This is to protect you from the insecticides, just in case. You're gonna have to wear a gas mask too. Strict rules. Ow! Company policy. We take every precaution. It'll give you immunity, in case you have any problems. Now, here's the balance of your payment. If you'd just sign this receipt. I like doing business with you fellas. Don't worry, there'll be more. The war has only just started. Right. Tally-ho. Tally-ho. Chops, don't forget to set the timers. Oh, yeah. (Chops) 'Are you sure this will cut off Tuela?' Stop worrying. It's just two roads to Tuela, right? - Let's get to the other one. - Right. [tires screeching] [timer ticking] All set, Dudley. Finished over here. That's it. They're set to go off in sequence every 15 minutes. It should make the road impassable for at least two hours. Oh, well. Nobody's ever pulled off a job like this. Well, I hope it makes you a big man in Sing Sing, if that's what you want. [Chops laughing] (Chops) 'Are you kidding? It'll make me a big man in any prison.' 'I can't lose.' [timer ticking] [airplane engine droning] * There's nothing that can wake me like the ol' wild blue * * Especially when I got a job * * Killing bugs to do * * So make some room and watch this black boy fly * * All you little bugs * * You rotten little bugs * * If you take a whiff you go die ** Well, this is it. Good luck, Chops. [sniffs] Yeah. Good luck, Dud. [wincing] Listen, I don't wanna get sentimental, but.. I just want you to know that if it wasn't for you.. ...I'd be getting a hernia heisting TV sets. Look, Chops, you have given me ambition. A reason to live, a chance to prove myself. I almost feel like a.. ...human being again. Over the top. Yeah. Over the top. Did you go to the bathroom? - Oh. - You forgot? I'm too nervous. [timer ticking] [intense music] [timer ticking] Perfect timing, right? [car engine revving] [tires screeching] - It works. - Of course, it works. (Dusty) 'Well, that's my signal.' Over target. (Dusty) 'Come on, mother.' 'Let's sell that bug juice.' 'Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones' 'are gonna learn' 'just what precision is all about.' ''Cause here come The Fumigator.' [airplane engine droning] Let's go. (Dusty) 'Take this, you ecology freaks.' 'I'm spraying this shit on everything that tweeks.' [pedestrians coughing] [telephone ringing] [dramatic music] [coughing continues] [sirens wailing] - What's goin' on here? - I don't know. Must be spraying for insects or something, there's a.. ...pile of it all over the road down here. [coughing] State five to Tuela PD. 'State five to Tuela PD.' Tue PD to State five. We weren't notified you were delousing the city today. The only time we delouse this city is on Election Day. 'Then what's that white stuff' 'that airplane's spraying all over the city.' (Tuela PD) 'What airplane?' (Tuela PD) 'What white stuff?' [aircraft engine droning] [coughing and wheezing] Tue PD, Tue.. '...feel dizzy..' [switches flicked] State five to zero zero. State five to zero zero. (female over radio) 'Zero zero to State five. Over.' (State five) 'This aircraft's layin' a cloud of white mist or something' 'all over the city.' 'Police radio is out.' 'The last thing they said' 'it was making everybody dizzy.' This is Detective Sergeant Poultry. What is this white mist you're talkin' about? Officer, it's some kind of cloud this airplane's layin' all over Tuela. There's a big yellow cloud of it up here on the hill. We can't get through it. - What is your location? - Couple of miles east Tuela. (Dudley) This is incredible, Chop. People's respiratory systems 'should neutralize the effects of the gas within an hour.' (Chops) 'Oh, wow, Dud, look at that guy go.' (Chops) 'Ha ha. It's like old times.' [tires screeching] (Dudley) I hope these people don't bruise themselves too badly. Oh, come now! You're putting me on. [laughs] Hey, hey, what is it? Russian or Chinese? Maybe it's from outer space, huh? I wouldn't kid you, Colonel. You mean, there's an honest to goodness gas attack? And I'm sure it's the same guys who pulled the restaurant job. 'I'm on my way there now.' I'll mobilize a special unit. And an attack force. We'll be rolling in five minutes. See you there. [comical music] (Dudley) Folks, folks, we're medical men. We're here to help you. - 'Let's go!' - Come here, come here. (Dudley) Come here. Swallow this. (Dudley) You'll be alright. - For cryin' out loud! - Bye. (Chops) This is not time to play Florence Nightingale. [tires screeching] [bugle call] - Hut! - Oh, let's go, let's go. - Let's go! - Get your vehicles rollin'! Get movin', it's a sneak attack! 'Start your engines.' Go, go, go, go! Let's go! [indistinct chatter] [honking] [clamor] Oh, no! Come on.. get your wheels movin'. 'I'm goin', I'm goin'.' [indistinct shouting] 'Don't bump me! Oh, shit.' What's wrong, goddamn it? Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go. Get your vehicles movin'. Get movin', it's a sneak attack. Go, go, go, go! Let's go! Coming, sir. Uh, my zipper's caught. Let's go, let's go. Come on! Hurry up! Move it! (Lockyer) What the hell is that duck doin' here? Get it the hell out of here! We're not going to the beach! Sheesh. Get this vehicle out of here. Move it. Let's move out! Move out! [blowing whistle] (Lockyer) Get that civilian jalopy off the road. (Lockyer) Military vehicles have the right of way. Who do you think you are? [Lockyer shouting] (Lockyer) Get off the road! [siren wailing] (Chops) Now remember, Dud, this is my department. Don't worry about nothin'. Okay? Now just remember, urgency, urgency. (Chops) We go in there, get the loot, and get the hell out fast. - Alright? - Alright. (Chops) Now, wait a minute, don't go in. Wait for me. Now, Dudley, look. The bank dick. How come he's not gassed? He's stuck in an air pocket between the two doors. The gas hasn't gotten to him yet. Yeah, but he's seen us. He's gonna ruin everything. That bastard will squeal on us. Look, there's no way that he can identify us. What we have to do is get the doors open so the gas will get to him and knock him out. Open up. Open up. Who are you? What do you want? We're from the gas company. Yeah and we came to fix your leak. We have to do it right away. Yeah, we think the leak is in the vault. I haven't got a mask. It's okay. We're fast workers. You don't need a mask. (Dudley) Just hurry up, open the door before it's too late. - Come on. - Terrific. Attaboy. You're a good man. Breathe deeply. [all coughing] (Dudley) The vault's over there. (Dudley) Ladies and gentlemen, stay calm. (Dudley) This is just a rehearsal. (Chops) My money! (Dudley) 'Calm, cool and collected.' - We did it. We did it. - Swallow this. (Dudley) Compliments of the gas company. Didn't I tell you I knew my craft? Nobody would give me any credit. - Yeah! - We did it! We robbed two banks within minutes of each other. It's a first. Nobody will ever believe it. When I woke up this morning I was a nobody, and now look at me. Wait till I tell the guys at Attica and-and Leavenworth. (Chops) I'll be a star. They'll put me in a library. I'm very happy for you. Oh! My helmet. [siren wailing] [door opens] [people coughing] [coughing] [airplane engine droning] (Lockyer) Prepare to sling masks. Prepare to sling mask. (Lockyer) Defuse that bomb.. [blowing whistle] 'Defuse that bomb. On the double.' Get those civilians to the rear. This is it. Let's go. Let's go. (Lockyer) Get those vehicles out of here. Get 'em back. Come on, get out, girls. Come on. Move it. (Lockyer) Get 'em out, get 'em out, move it out. Turn the vehicle around. - Let's go. - Let's move, let's move. - Come on. - On the double, men. On the double, on the double. Lieutenant, lieutenant, bring the glasses quickly. [dramatic music] [dramatic music] The town's under siege. - Men! Attention, men. - Colonel? The city of Tuela is under siege. For the first time in almost 60 years a gas attack has been carried out against a populated area. Colonel? Evacuate that casualty. When we move down into that no man's land remember, the eyes.. the eyes of the War Department, the Department of the Army the joint Chiefs of Staff and hopefully some local TV station will be on us. Today, men, on this battlefield we will prove the cause of chemical warfare. Colonel, if you've finished with The Gettysburg Address can we step on the gas? This town is being looted. Right! Decon unit forward. Decon unit, let's go. Let's get that pressure on. Move it, move it. Let's move it. That's it, we're coming through. Come on, on the double. That's it, stop here. Right over there. (Dusty) 'All through for the day.' 'So you bugs can go on your dead ass way.' 'What's all that movin' around down there?' 'I'd better go down and see what's happenin'.' Sir! Unidentified aircraft approaching at 2 o'clock. Range 2600, give or take a couple of hundred yards. It's a surplus primary trainer. 'And the thing's hanging under the wings.' It's the army. What the hell is going on down there? We're under attack! Take cover. Take cover. Take cover. [military music] - Prepare for air attack. - Prepare for air attack. 'What the hell all those folks runnin' around for?' 'Must be an accident.' - Commence firing. - Commence firing. [gunshots] What you shootin' me for? [gunshots] - Run for your lives! - Run for your lives. What the hell kind of a command is that? 'Run for your lives.' [explosion] - Sling masks! - Sling masks. - 'Sling masks.' - Sling masks. - Sling masks! - Sling mask. Sling what? - Sling masks! - Where's your mask? I lost it at the last peace demonstration. Sergeant, get him a mask. Yes, sir. Decon unit! On that farm. 'Decon unit, on that farm!' 'On the double out there.' (Lockyer) Get rid of that cloud. 'Defuse that cloud.' 'Hustle it up, men.' - Casualties! - Casualties! (Lockyer) 'Get those casualties into the hospital, men.' You'll be okay. (Lockyer) This is war! Not maneuvers. Hustle it up, men. - Unsling masks! - Unsling masks. - 'Unsling masks.' - 'Unsling masks.' Unsling mask! Unsling mask. Well, this mask is making me sick! Keep your mask on until we get past the road block. It's a green van. [coughs] A green van. Heading south. Sir, the road ahead is clear. I have a report that the enemy is headed this way in a green van. Let's move out! Move out! [blows whistle] - Hut! - Move out! Move out! [blows whistle] Let's get rolling, men. - Forward, ho! - Hey, wait for me. Forward, ho! [jeep sputters] (Chops) 'Hey, Dud, look, the army!' Hey, that's my old outfit. (Dudley) There's Scottie! Hold it! Hold it! Fall back! Turn around! Turn around! [blowing whistle] Turn around. Turn around. [indistinct chatter] [blowing whistles] [indistinct chatter] What's going on here? Fall in! Defensive formation. Vehicle, fall in! The town is being ripped off. [engine revving] Uh-oh, we're in trouble, Dud. (Chops) 'They're on our tail.' 'Alright, now, don't panic. Don't get panicky.' 'Now, this is what we're gonna do.' We stop the van, we get out with our hands up high, very high. Or behind your head. Which ever you prefer. We lie down on the ground and let them take it from there. Okay? Soldiers don't surrender that way. Well, you surrender your way, I'm gonna surrender mine. - Come on, step on it. - What are you doing? Come on, just keep your foot on the gas. You'll get out of this. (Chops) 'Dudley, let me surrender.' (Dudley) 'Turn, turn, turn.' Follow left! Ho-ho! [bugle call] That's Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones. 'I wonder why the Army is chasing them?' - Now, what are you doing? - I've got an idea. You head into that canyon. I got something that'll stop 'em. 'I hope you know what you're doing.' [instrumental music] Smoke screen. [music continues] Pull up! Pull up! [coughing] Call 'em halt! - Back up! - Yes, sir. [blowing whistle] Retreat! I didn't say &quot;Retreat&quot;. - I said back up! - Sorry, sir. Alright, just back up! Deploy on the left flank. [coughing] I'm gassed. I'm gassed. Colonel, am I gassed? No, no. Not yet. [coughing] [metal clanking] (Chops) 'Dudley, we're trapped.' Oh, we're trapped! 'Our backs are to the wall. There's no way out.' It's gonna be a classic surrender. Yeah, well, I will never surrender. They'll have to capture me first. So, let them catch you. I'm fed up with this shit. Hey, come on, give me a hand. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna lay a smoke screen. It'll give us more time. [sighing] Yeah, well, that's all they're gonna get. Lots of time. This is our most defensible position. I'd rather be under the truck. It won't work. You sit one of them down over there. Dudley, I think the gas has affected your brain. - Over there. - Over here? Yeah, right over there. [panting] I have the right to remain silent. I have the right to be represented by counsel. And I have the right to appear before a magistrate. [horn honking] [blowing whistle] [explosion] [explosion] (Lockyer) 'He's up there waiting for me.' Waiting for me to make the first move. Alright, I'll fool him. I'm gonna make my second move first. 'Prepare for a mortar attack.' [indistinct chatter] Prepare for muzzle mortar attack! Get out of that vehicle! Come on, out! Get out of that truck! [indistinct chatter] [blowing whistle] Alright, zero in up on that area up there. Yes, sir. [engine revving] Dudley, here comes the pride of kill zone! [instrumental music] What is he doing coming here? Go back! Go back! Oh-ho, that's all we need. The schmuck is gonna gas us. Get out of here, Dusty! Go back! Dusty, go back! You're not supposed to land here now. We're under attack. Go back, Dusty! Dusty, get the plane back up in the air. - Dusty, get out of here! - Get out of here, Dusty. Gentleman, there are lot of details I can't piece together. Like did we do such a good job over Tooele that the army wants us to help them with the maneuvers? I mean is that a clear representation of what I saw from the air? Yeah, that's fair, Dusty. But get it up! Then why did they shoot holes in my wings? 'Well, you see there's a lot of top secret classified' equipment in this operation, right. And the army got a little, uh, sensitive about it. Okay? Oh! But, y-you're pleased with my work? 'Oh, you deserves an oak leaf cluster, Dusty.' Will you give him a fig leaf and tell him to get the hell out of here already. Get the plane up. Now, wait a minute. Sir, mortar unit ready to receive range and type of projectile information. Good. - Wind, nine mile.. - Geez! Don't ever do that. Use the wind instrument. Stop showing off. [instrumental music] On target, sir. I don't see a thing. Very good. We're using a new nerves gas, GZS II. It penetrates the gas mask but it doesn't kill. You sure I can't work with you in this job? Yeah, I'm sure. It's just not your thing. Next time, we'll all be together. Alright? Wait a second. Wait a minute. I wanna give you something to pay for the.. ...the holes in your wings. - Just wait a minute. - What? Pay him? What do you mean &quot;Pay him?&quot; Fire for effect. Command, sergeant. [blows whistle] Here, this will take care of everything. Now, get out of here! [explosion] I'm getting the hell out of here. [explosion] Oh! GZS II. I got the antidote. Chops! - Chops! - I'm here. Hands against the van, feet spread apart. Here, take this pill. It'll make you immune. - What? - And put your gas mask on. [explosion] Oh, shit. Where you going? Stay where you are. Dusty! Dusty! Here, take one of these. And put your gas mask on. This is part of the maneuver. [explosion] I got an idea. Dusty, you can work with us in this job. I'm with you. What do you want me to do? Cease fire! Cease fire! [indistinct chatter] Prepare to advance through a smoke screen. Forward march! Wing masks! Forward march. [indistinct] [instrumental music] [music continues] [blowing whistle] Over the top, men. Which top? Top of the hill, I guess. [engine revving] [music continues] Fish tail it back and forth like that. So we cover everything. - 'How am I doing?' - That's great. You make beautiful wind. 'Ha ha ha. Look at that.' [Dudley laughing] Hold it! Hey, we've got a team. What a team! I had the same idea. You're terrific. [music continues] Damn civilians, always in the way. Is that man retreating? You're damn right. GZS II. You gave us the wrong wind direction. No, sir. They must be blowing it back at our faces. Am I gassed? - Am I gassed? - You are now. And so am I. [groaning] - We've beaten them, Chops. - Yeah. Look at that. Look at that. We can walk right through 'em. Why walk...when we can fly? [laughing] Yeah! Dusty, how'd you like to do a job with us in Mexico? Yeah, it's infested down there. Okay. Here, take this. How do we do this now? Hey, look...you hang on to one wing. You hang on to the other. Okay. Hang out my ass, where is my parachute? Alright, let's go. [engine revving] Don't worry, I'll get this old mother off the ground! Oh, my god, I can't believe it. Hallelujah! Dusty, let me off. Something wonderful is happening and I need a medical opinion. What's the matter? You're gettin' shot? No. Something just came up. Understand? I'll see you in Mexico. Scottie.. Scottie.. Where are you? Scottie. Scottie. Where are you? Scottie. Scottie. Scottie. [coughing] Scottie. - Scottie. - You! You robbed that town. Yeah, yeah, but that's not the point, now. Scottie, I have to see you privately right away. Scottie, everything we ever dreamed about is coming true right now. Ooh! Quick! In the Med-Evac unit. Ooh. Wait a minute! What am I doing? Look, you were sensational. But what you did was wrong. Oh, God please, don't start moralizing in a time like this. Will you? I'm not going in there until you promise to give back the money. I mean it. As much as I want you. Boy, this is gonna go down as the most expensive bang in history. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Anything you say. Okay. 'Okay, let's go.' Whoo! Come on. I think it was the combination of GZS II and the antidote. Dudley, shut up. Oh, my God. May I help you with your pants? Yeah. [indistinct chatter] Do you have to take that off? Just get your pants down. I know, I know, I know. Hey, there you go. Wait. My boots.. No, leave your boots on. [Scottie moaning] [instrumental music] [door squeaking] Ooh! [chuckling] I'll see you in Mexico. I'll be there. [tongue clicking] Ooh. [chuckling] Ooh. Keep the money. - Um-hmm? - Hm. [instrumental music] [dramatic music] [music continues] Colonel.
