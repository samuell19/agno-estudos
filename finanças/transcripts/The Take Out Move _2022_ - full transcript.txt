- Thank you for coming. - Thank you for selecting me. I know it must have been a difficult decision. It was. This is the girl. Her name is Amber. Address on the back. I think your mission is clear. Not a problem, Mr. Fanst. Consider it done. Before you take her out, you must ensure that she successfully completes this series of tasks laid out before her. It is only after these tasks are completed that you can move forward with taking her out. - Is that clear? - Absolutely. Yes, sir. As always, secrecy is imperative. It must be done quietly by you by 8:00. If you haven't taken her out by then, the deal is off. Remember, this is your final job before full induction. Succeed, and you will be accepted. Failure, as you know, leads to termination. Understood. Not a problem. I like you. You know that, right? Yes. Yes. I want you to know you are the only person I selected for this job. I trust you will be able to do it... alone. Of course. Of course. Good. Yeah. I don't know, he's just lying on the couch. Because he's unconscious. What was I supposed to do, call an ambulance and wait around and answer questions all day? Yeah, exactly. It's not my fault this keeps happening to me. That time was completely different. I don't know, shaggy hair, scruffy face. He's not completely hideous if that's what you're asking. I don't know. Why would I peek at his dick? Yeah, well, clearly you don't know me as well as you think you do. Okay, fine, I looked at his dick. Meh! Yeah. Okay. Look, I got to go. Lots to do today. All right. See you soon. Bye. Hi. Hey. Can you hear me? Wow! What the fuck? What the fuck? Hey! Are you okay? I don't know. Where am I? You're in my living room. What happened? - A door hit you. - What? - In the face. - What? I hit you with a door in the face. Look, the details really aren't important. How are you feeling? Like a truck just ran me over. Oh, you poor thing. If you follow me into the kitchen, I can get some ice for your vagina. What? You hit me in the face. - Barely. - You knocked me unconscious. - With a door. - Wh... Well, I guess that makes me "a-door-able." Oh, or maybe that makes you a total pussy. Come on. - This is a nice place. - Oh, thanks. I just rent out the guest room, but the owners of the place are always traveling, so I kind of have the full run of the place. Right now, they're in Belize. Really? For how long? About a month. It's cool, right? That's super cool. - I'm Whalen, by the way. - Amber. Nice to meet you. Except for the whole door-to-the-face thing. Right! An ice pack for your vag. I almost forgot. Your vagina is down there. - Thanks, but... - Ice your vagina. - But I don't... - Ice your vagina. There. Is that better? My dick is cold. But how's your vagina? It's cool too. - Is that cake? - Yeah, I made it. - Do you want a piece? - Sure. It's red velvet. Oh. Then never mind. You don't like red velvet cake? Don't even get me started on red velvet cake. What's wrong with red velvet cake? Red velvet cake is just a bland, semi-chocolate-adjacent confection that people have only convinced themselves they like simply because it's a pretty color. Red velvet cake is awesome! Really? Because if it wasn't red, nobody would eat it. If it was brown, it would just be pretty shitty chocolate cake, and nobody would care. Great. Now you've ruined my favorite dessert. Thank you for that. You are welcome. Can I take this ice off my dick now? In all seriousness, I do feel bad about hitting you with that door. - In the face. - In the face. Listen, I'm gearing up for a pretty big day, but feel free to stay and rest as long as you need. I'm not going anywhere anytime soon. Thanks, I will. Come on. There we go, nice and easy. I should probably get that. Probably. - Hi! - Hi! - Melissa? - No. Is Melissa here? No, no Melissas here. Nobody named Melissa lives here? Really? I see. I knew it! I knew this would happen again! This always happens! I shouldn't even be surprised. - What? - Nothing. What happened? Nothing! I shouldn't have even expected her to show up. They never show up. I hate blind dates. Someone told you Melissa lived here? You poor thing. And you brought flowers. You poor thing. No! Oh, can I ask you a question and you promise me you'll be honest? Of course. Is that red velvet cake? - Yes. - I love red velvet cake. I know! So good, right? So good. Only a complete fucking asshole wouldn't like red velvet cake. Amen, brother! Would you like a piece? I don't know if I should. A lifetime on the hips, you know what I mean? I do. But you know what? Sometimes you just have to say "fuck it." - Fuck it! - Exactly! Because you deserve cake. I do deserve cake, don't I? You deserve red velvet cake! The best cake. The best cake for the best boy! - Thank you. - Of course. This has been a crazy day... for a lot of people. Why don't you sit down and get a bit of rest first? Okay. Come on. There we go. Do you want to talk about it? What's wrong with me? - Whalen? - Davis. Do you two know each other? How do you two know each other? We share common interests. Really? That's nice! Yes, it's very nice. It's the best thing ever. Oh, will you guys excuse me for just a minute? Of course. Not a problem. - What are you doing here? - Nothing. What are you doing here? - Nothing. - Yeah, me too. Mr. Fanst didn't by chance call you in for a meeting recently? - Maybe. You? - Maybe. - So we're here for the same thing, aren't we? - Certainly, seems that way. - Any chance we can both do this? - I don't think so. Evidently, one of us is supposed to fail. - I'm afraid I can't afford to do that. - Well, neither can I. Well, then, I'd say we have a problem on our hands. I'd say you do. Sorry about that. What were we talking about? Davis was just explaining how he got rid of his latest... rash. What was the name of that ointment again? I'll be sure to write it down so the pharmacist gets it just right for you. His is a scorcher. That's what we were talking about? Yeah. You don't remember? That's all this guy ever talks about it, his "region." - I don't talk about my region that much. - It's pretty constant. I don't talk about my region in great frequency. I actually don't even refer to it as my "region." - He calls it his region all the time. - I don't talk about my region! See? He's still doing it. I'm pretty sure that's not what we were talking about. Are you okay? Yeah. What's wrong with you? There's something really wrong with him. I"m glad you noticed too. What's wrong with you? All this region talk. Honestly! I'd say it's beneath you, but now I'm not so certain that it is. Why don't you go peddle your pornography elsewhere, you smutmonger. It's disgusting, and I will not allow it underneath my roof. Why don't you just show us on the doll where he touched you? You've offended our host and the damage is beyond repair. I suggest you leave immediately. Good day, sir! Well, that's not exactly what I meant. Yeah, Whalen, don't be so judgmental. He's so judgmental. Intolerant, really. That's probably a better word for it, intolerant. It's sad. Disgusting, even. "Disgusting" might be how most people describe it. Is this because I'm 1/64 Cherokee? So racist, Whalen, so racist! You should leave. Go until you can get some proper counseling and some real perspective. Go. Heal your mind, heal your heart, heal your soul. Take some much needed Whalen time. It's okay. Nobody here is going to judge you. Anyway, so sorry you have to leave so soon. We're really going to miss you, pal. Oh, such a bummer you have to be leaving. Hey, write, keep in touch. And, hey, don't be a stranger. Are you both leaving? - No. - No. So, you're both staying. - No. - No. I think I know what's going on here. You do? It's pretty obvious. It is? You both have had a really rough day, and you both need some rest. Nobody's going anywhere until I'm good and ready. And I won't take no for an answer. - Yes, ma'am. - Okay. Good. Follow me. Relax and make yourselves right at home. I'll be back to check on you boys in a bit. What is your problem? How dare you imply that I'm 1/64 racist? You know I'm sensitive to the plight of the Native peoples. - What are you talking about? - Why do you always have to cause problems? Me? What are you talking about? A rash on my region! Where the hell did that come from? - That was funny. - Yeah, funny like a fox. Mm... Just don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out. Oh, okay. I'm a little confused. Are you walking or should I call you a cab? Look, she's gonna come out of that room in less than one minute. And when she does, one of us had better not be here. Like, I don't know, you, for example. I'll tell you what. Why don't we put it to a vote? Who here thinks Whalen should stay? Let's see, one, two, three... Wow! No one. Nobody likes you. It's unanimous. Leave. - Don't touch me. - I'm sorry. Why don't you leave and we'll call it even? Okay, that sounds fair. Let me just give you this first, though, hold on a second. Fun's over. Guess so. Let's do this. Let's! Uh! Ouch! Time out! Time out! Time out! - What is it? - I think got something in my eye. Ew, is it an eyelash? Can you see it? Let me look. Oh! What the fuck? Yeah, you like that? No, I did not like that, at all. That was a cheap shot and you know it. What's wrong with you? All's fair in love and war, bitch. - This is why no one likes you. - No, it's not! I mean, people like me. All right, fine. Nah, I'm just kidding. I can't really do a back flip. Oh, that would have been so awesome! - Right? - Yeah. Bitch! Are you guys feeling better? Good! - Ow! - Ow! - What? - What? - Stop copying me! - Stop copying me! - No! - No! - Yes! - Yes! - Damn it! - Damn it! Okay, okay. It's getting ridiculous. I have an idea. Heads, I stay; tails, you leave. Wait, how dumb do you think I am? I get to flip it. Hmm. Tails. Ceiling looks good. You wanna check the floorboards? Sure. Sure. Oh, my God! I'm so exhausted! I need to do more cardio. No more skipping Zumba class. Promise yourself, Davis. Let me just catch my breath. Then I'll kick your ass. You're so dead... as soon as I find an oxygen tank. Just... just another minute. Just a little more. Rest is good. - Okay. - I'm ready... whenever you are. I'm ready. Okay, I'm ready. No. No. Not yet, not yet. - Oh, I think I'm dying. - Oh, thank God. Hi. - You okay? - What's wrong? My help for today just totally bailed on me. I'm so screwed. I have so much to do today. Now I'm never gonna get it all done. - I'll help you. - I will too. Really? You guys would do that? I won't leave until everything on your list is done. Me either. Oh, my God! You guys are lifesavers. I can't believe you guys would do this for me. Well, I'm full of surprises. You're full of something. - Holy shit! - I know, right? The owners of this house asked me to help them clean out some of this stuff. I could really use your help with a bit of the lifting. - Of course. - That's what we're here for. So, which of the stuff do you need help moving? - All of it. - All of it? W-Where are we supposed to put it all? In there. But all this stuff won't fit in there. Thank you. Let me know when you're done. What the fuck? Whatever, wussy. Start lifting. I'm not a wuss. You're a wuss. You are a wuss, that's why I said it. So, the recipe I developed for my class is an original organic vegan spin on classic Scandinavian comfort food. Look, we don't have that much time. I don't care what it tastes like, we tell her it's fantastic and move on, got it? Got it. Here it is. That looks amazing. Yes, very... inventive. Wait till you taste it. - What is it? - It's chicken. Chicken? I thought you said it was vegan. It is. It's "chicken" with a "K." Chicken's always spelled with a "K." What the fuck is going on? You guys wanna know what's really weird? We call cows beef, pig pork, sheep mutton, and deer venison, but chicken... We just call it chicken. Isn't that weird? What the fuck are you talking about? Try it! You seem really uncomfortable. Dude, just, honestly, don't get so close. Why are you so uncomfortable with this? Why are you not uncomfortable with this? - Stop moving, please. - Sorry. I'm just really comfortable with my masculinity. This kind of stuff doesn't really bother me. - My inner thigh is touching your dick. - Is it? I hadn't really noticed Little G sort of has a mind of his own. Little G? Your dick's a rapper now? My dick's musical stylings are not confined to one genre and defy labeling, thank you very much. And I'm pretty sure my dick is touching your thigh. - That's what I just said. - No. You said that your thigh was touching my dick, but my dick is touching your thigh. Little G is the aggressor. I just wanted to make sure you knew that. - Stop moving. - Sorry. She's right, though, you probably should stop moving. - Especially your inner thigh. - Oh, my God! On second thought, keep doing it. Stop it. Okay, jiggle, do it. - Oh, yeah. - Stop it. Oh, jiggle for me. Jiggle. Yeah. Don't move! - Don't move. - Stop it. Oh! - Please tell me you're faking. - Stop climaxing. Sorry. I'm telling you, this one girl's room smelled like shit. I know that we say that spoiled milk and dirty sneakers smell like shit, but they don't. They smell bad; her room smelled like shit. Like a pile of shit. Like somebody just went in there, took a dump, and then left it there for like a very long time. And then she just went on living her life as if the pile and the stink weren't there. So, what did you do? She broke up with me. Can't you like just try to sympathize? Shut up. Oh. What do you think? Davis, you have to try it too. Mm! That's... something. - Right? - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. - Right. The secret ingredient is love. - Hmm. - I'm just kidding. The secret ingredient is Helsinki yak juice. Ugh! Yak... juice? Yeah! I don't even wanna ask what that means. Not that it's super important right now, but anything coming from a yak is not vegan. Sure, it is. This is from a yak. - With a "K." - Yak was always spelled with a K. You know what? Never mind. Do you like it? Yeah, it's... Yeah, it's pretty good. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Good! Keep eating! This is gonna go really bad in like 20, 25 minutes. All right, only two more courses to go. - Ow! Hurry up! - I'm trying! How many cats could she possibly have? This is clearly the work of a mountain lion. Oh, God, I got it in my eye! I'm blind! Cat piss made me blind! Her cats need a healthier diet. Get a dog, woman! - Help me! - I can't see! - Lift the bag! - I can't! I don't wanna do this anymore. So, what I'm saying is, you know how some gay guys talk in stereotypical gay voice? I don't think we should be talking about this. Well, what if everyone had their own stereotypical voice? Like you go into a bar and every woman you meet, you know instantly what she's into just by the sound of her voice, right off the bat. Just by her accent, you know that this girl's into S&M, and then you don't have to find out the hard way two hours later when she's melting cinnamon-scented candle wax all over your junk. That's oddly specific. No, it isn't. Instead, right away, you know from the moment they say hello, you would know that this girl does anal on the first date. And this guy, he definitely goes down on his woman for like a very long time. It'd be a hell of a system and it would really, really streamline the whole dating process. You're weird guy. I know. Doesn't mean I'm wrong, though. So, the second course is just pickles? Don't even get me started on pickles. What's wrong with pickles? Why would anyone do that to a cucumber? I mean, brine? Really? You have really strong opinions about food. Look, I get it if you're sailing across the ocean and it's the only way to preserve food because it's the 1600s or whatever, but nowadays, people have refrigerators. So we no longer need to soak our food in piss and vinegar or whatever it is. I'm pretty sure the first ingredient in brine is not piss. Really? And what is it, then? What's in pickle juice? - I have no idea. - So, it could be piss. - It's not piss. - It's probably piss. You guys basically just confirmed that it's piss. Can't argue with science. - Excuse me, Amber. - Yes? - Why am I holding this grapefruit? - Why do you care? Because I thought it would be cool and fun to draw. I'm trying to understand my motivation. Your motivation is to stand there and shut up so she can draw us as quick as possible before you try to get me pregnant. Oh, relax. That would never happen. You're not my type. What the hell's that supposed to mean? - Huh? - "You're not my type." I'm everyone's fucking type. Are you fucking kidding me right now? No. I'm manly in a non-threatening way. I'm charming and I have rugged good looks. Any woman would be lucky to have me. Okay. Admit it, if you were a man and I was a woman, you'd totally wanna fuck me. - I am a man. - Uh... see what I mean? You're a very strange dude. It's not my fault you're into me. - Stop moving! - Sorry. - Can you scoop... - Hold the bag! - Hold the fucking bag! - Okay! - Why does she hate us? - Why do the cats hate us? They don't hate us, they hate her! - Your cats hate you! - Just so you know. Did you two say something? - Nope. - So glad we can help. Yay, cats! Oh, good! Ow! Ow! Stop! Ah! Okay, good. So now just go to your desktop. - My desktop? - Yes. - Go to your desktop. - Okay. How do I do that? Okay, it's just like I showed you before. 30 seconds ago. For the fourth time. But that's okay. You just... - This? - No. - This? - No. - This? - No! Don't do that! - Sorry. - No, it's fine. These things take time. Let's just try it a different way. What's a right click? Oh. My. God! Any notes? Can we go inside now? Second verse, same as the first. You can't declaw cats. When I was a kid, everyone declawed their cats to preserve their furniture. You can't declaw cats. It's cruel. Cruel? We neuter them all the time. Bob Barker encouraged that shit for years. But that's to control the population. Oh, so it's inhumane to trim a cat's claws, but to chop their balls off is totally cool? You know what? You're actually making a lot of sense right now, which means I've been breathing in cat piss fumes for way too long. Fuck you! Sometimes, there is no truth. Let's say you meet a girl at a bar. Does she have a specific lisp? Shut up. It's 2:00 a.m. You're drunk. You go back to her place for a little ground and pound, and then you sneak out as you're won't to do, and you find your way home. Now, was that girl looking hot that night? There's no way of knowing. You can't remember her name and you don't remember how to get back to her house, so you can never go back there, even if you wanted to, and you don't. And she can't contact you because you were meticulous about not leaving behind any distinguishing information, which is part, but not all, of the reason why you gave her the fake name Paco. And even if she could contact you, what's she gonna say? Girls have no realistic sense of what they look like anyway. Skinny girls think they're fat, fat girls think they're skinny, and deep down even the most attractive women in the world think they're disgusting. Now, your friends were also there. No matter how hot she was, they're just gonna tell you she was ugly. And no matter what kind of sorry-ass, low-down, ragged bitch she looked and smelled like, you're going to insist to your dying day that she was so motherfucking fine. So, what's the truth? There is no truth. She's Schrodinger's biatch. She's both hot and butt-ugly at the same goddamn time. That's actually pretty deep. Hey, if you bang an ugly chick in the forest, and no one's around to see it, did you actually bang her? Yes, Whalen, you did. The answer on that's not gonna change. Stop asking. Okay, so I know grammar and punctuation can be confusing, but you just need to add a comma. Here? After the verb. After the verb. What part of speech is "angina"? Is it a verb? And that's not what "irrepressibly" means. - Why not? - Because it doesn't. And "conversate" is not a word, I promise you. Oh, really? Because I'm pretty sure you and I are "conversating" right now. Don't. Just don't. Fine. I guess I'll just "conversate" by myself. I hate our school system. - Are semicolons real? - I hate it so much. What does spell check do? Fuck cats. You got a dog? Yeah, I have a little pug and chihuahua mix. - You'd love him. - That's great, man. - I have an English Mastiff. - Holy shit. Yeah. You wanna see my big guy? Definitely, but let me show you mine first. Hold on, sometimes it gets stuck in my pants. All right, feast your eyes on this. Wow! You're right, man, that's super cute. - Thanks, man. - That's a perfect size. Yeah, I'm really lucky. Works great for me too. Makes the chicks go crazy. - Really? - Hell, yeah! I mean, I take him out, walk to the park, meet tons of women that way. Really? You just take him out and show him off? Hell, yeah. I mean, I show them my best smile first, but it's when they look down and see him that they just go crazy. They come running over and they're so excited to put their hands all over him and give him tons of kisses. Sometimes two or three girls at a time. The amount of stroking from random women at the park is unbelievable. All right, now, check out the size of this fat hog. Holy shit! You weren't lying. - That sucker is huge. - Yeah. Sometimes I think this big might actually be too big. Really? I didn't know there was such a thing. Oh, there is. Trust me. When you're toting around one this big, - it actually makes it harder to meet women. - Huh. Most girls see from a distance and they just start backing away slowly. And if there's kids around, pfft, forget about it. Nobody's gonna let their kids touch a monster this size. Not that I'd want them to, but, I mean, if their moms are okay with it, I guess I would be too, you know? - Mm, yeah. - Don't get me wrong. There's some cool things about having something this big. It keeps me from getting bored when I'm lonely, especially when it's the middle of the night and I can't sleep. But cleaning up after he's done his thing... Not cool, believe me. - You know what we should do? - What? - Put them together. - I don't know. I don't know if I'd be comfortable around something that big. Let alone how my little guy would react. - Although, it could be kind of cool. - Right? You've convinced me. Let's do it. All right, that's enough, you sickos! Keep your dicks away from each other! That was good advice. You're welcome. Come on. All right, boys, we're going for a ride. Great. Where are we headed? - It's a surprise. - How fun. It's gonna be super fun. Okay, but first, let me finish my thought, please? - Fine. - Okay, so as I was saying, my dick is not that dirty. I mean, I wash my hands when I take a piss, sure, I'm not an animal, but this dude, he went and took a piss and then proceeded to wash his hands in scalding hot water and a pile of soap for like five minutes just because he touched his own dick. I mean, I don't know what meth-head's dirty, dirty ass crack this dude was messing around in ten minutes before that, but my dick's not that dirty. And if your dick is that dirty, like so dirty that your hands just touch it and they instantly become absolutely fucking filthy, then you're probably not the kind of guy who's in the habit of washing his hands when he takes a piss in the first place. - Can we go now? - If I'm being honest, I should be washing my hands before I touch my dick. My hands are disgusting. They touch all sorts of dirty shit every day, like doorknobs, and money, and shoelaces. I mean, my dick basically wakes up in the morning, it takes a shower, puts on a clean pair of underwear, and then just sits there all goddamn day, minding its own business. My dick's probably the cleanest part of my body. Except when it's touching your inner thigh, Whelan. Then the whole thing is dirty. The whole thing. - What is he talking about? - His region. Of course. Thank you, guys. I feel a lot better now. We can go. He sent me flowers every day. He asked me out every weekend, even though I kept saying no. He stopped by my apartment just to tell me he was thinking about me. It was so romantic. I miss him. That's fucking creepy. Persistence is romantic. It shows a woman how much you love her. The persistent pursuit of a woman is only called romantic in the movies. In real life, it's called stalking. That shit is illegal, trust me. Well, think about it. You buy a gallon of gas. You buy a gallon of milk. Would you ever buy a gallon of soda? No, you buy two-liter bottles of soda. Why? Nothing else in this country is in liters. If you tried to sell a liter of gas to an American, they'd punch you in the dick. Cans are in ounces. Even the little bottles of soda are on ounces. But if you want a big bottle, suddenly you're in Europe buying liters. It makes no fucking sense. I have a major rant boner right now. Can we please go? Okay, are we rolling? Davis, these are my cameramen. This is Johnny, and that's his brother Jimmy over there. - Hello. - We good? Okay. What's up, guys? Thanks for tuning in to this week's video. Don't forget to like and subscribe because we've got a great one for you today. Are you a YouTuber? I'm an influencer. It's prank week! Today's mark is waiting in line at a coffee shop. Well, you told him to get you a latte. Shut up. And he has no idea what's about to happen. - What is about to happen? - Shut up. Come on. Okay, there he is. - What are we doing? - Just follow my lead. There he is! This is the asshole I was telling you about. - What? - And his new slut. - Oh... - Oh, not so loyal that slut. Hurts, doesn't it... Steven? What's happening? I bet you thought you'd never see me again. Well, here I am. Kick his ass, Gary. - Me? - Yes, Gary. Do your thing. Okay. Hey, asshole! You better... s-stay away from my sister! Yeah, tell him, Gary! Yeah, you better not touch her ever again! - Guys, I'm a little confused. - Yeah. You're confused about what's gonna happen if you don't... s-stop trying to force her to have a back-alley abortion, you sicko! Oh, no. Nope, not me. No... no forced abortions here. - I... I don't even know them. - Oh, really... - Steven. - ...Steven? After you've explored each other from every angle and ravaged each other in every hole? - Well, maybe not every hole. - In every... single... hole. How dare you deny that you know her biblically, mythically, and exponentially? - Okay, maybe we should just... - Shh, you stay out of this. And you, you stay away from her dog too. Cringle doesn't like your kind of "petting." I don't care what you say. No more trying to hide the panda in the grotto. No more donkey punching. No more trying to make the bald man cry. You disgust me, sir. J'accuse! Yeah, well... you know what, Gary? Yeah... - Steven. - ...Steven? Maybe you should stop sending her dick pics. She doesn't want to see your dingus, no one does. - My dingus? - Yeah. Does anyone here want to see Gary's dingus? No one? No one! No one wants to see your dingus. Your dingus is unwanted. You send your sister dick pics? No. No, I don't. You look familiar. Don't you live in my building? Me? No, I've never been to apartment 3-C. Stop telling people I send my sister dick pics! - Stop telling people I wanna bang her dog! - Stop calling me Gary! This is really confusing. And let that be a lesson to you. She's gonna keep this baby, and we're gonna raise it as our own. And if I ever see you again, my sister's finger won't be the only thing getting repeatedly shoved up your ass. Don't forget the almond milk. That was so good! What? Like you've never tried to bang someone's dog before? No frontsies! Okay, that was fucking crazy, and she's crazy, and we both need to get the fuck out of here. You can go, I can't. I can't afford to fail. Neither can I. Fuck! How did we even end up here? I don't know. And I don't feel well. I think I have Ebola. Ebola. Really? Are you bleeding out of your ears, eyes, and anus? I'm not bleeding out of my ears and eyes. I am bleeding out of my anus, though, to be fair. I don't think that has anything to do with Ebola. What if we both just leave? - They'll have to grant one of us induction anyway, right? - I don't know. But if this is what it takes, I'm not even sure if I wanna be inducted in anymore. I can't handle any more of these tasks. Me either. Okay, I'll admit that ended up taking a few unexpected twists, but it turned out better than I could have ever imagined. Your "dingus" line is already trending. I consider that a job well done, boys. I'm all done with my list. Thank you so much for your help. - So, all your tasks are done? - Yeah. That means ours almost is too. - What? - Nothing. Okay, I have to go finish getting ready, but it's such a relief to have everything else done. We should celebrate. You heard the lady, it's time to celebrate. For one of us. And to think you almost just quit, bitch! Me? You almost just quit. - That's not how I remember it. - "That's not how I remember it." Look, the tasks are done. - It's time for one of us to finish this. - Fine! Then let's figure it out, once and for all, like men. Best of three! Why are you so good at this? Why are you so good at this? Why are you so good at this? - Fuck! - Fuck! - Fuck! - Fuck! - Fuck! - Yes! - Best of five! - What? - Yes! - No! One. I win! - Best of seven! - Ah! - Ow! - Yes! You suck! I found you! - You're it! - Damn it! Oh! Yes! Lick that! You're disgusting. Hey, so we're having a bit of trouble agreeing on a decision and we need your help. Got it. I'm thinking of a number between one and 100. - Go. - Uh... 37? 56. And the number is... Neither of those. Sorry, guys. Good luck. Hmm? Oh! - All right. Stop, stop, stop. - What? - Why? - What are we even doing? I don't know, I thought you knew the rules to this game. Okay, this is stupid and it's not even working. We need to figure this out and bring it to an end. Well, why don't I just kill you and take out Amber myself? You could die trying. Okay, look, neither of us is that tough, okay? - So, we might as well stop acting. - Oh! Thank God you said that. I was starting to feel uncomfortable. - Were you feeling uncomfortable? - A little bit, yeah. - Okay, I have an idea. - I was thinking the same thing! Pants-off dance-off? I like where this is headed. I'm in. What? No. Suppress your junk, please. - You sure? - Yes! Okay. We're gonna do this rationally. And you know what? No matter what happens, despite everything, I just wanted you to know that I had fun today. Of course you had fun; you got to hang out with me all day. - I had to fucking hang out with you. - You're the worst. I know. Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Each one of us is gonna give the other guy five minutes to accomplish the mission, and the best man wins. Deal. You can even go first. Thank you, I will. But you just said you were giving me five minutes to get it done. Right, I did. But I didn't say I wouldn't try and stop you. Oh! Ow! Ow! Whoa! Whoa! You will never reach the girl. We shall see. Your training is good, but not good enough. Your breath is terrible. You failed. You've gone soft. That is not what your mother said last night. Ha ha! That shows your ignorance. My mother is dead, just like you. You are no match for me. - You sound like an asshole. - You sound like an asshole. - So is your face. - Enough! This ends now! Why are you smiling? Your five minutes must be up soon. Oh, my five minutes ended a while ago. You've been on the clock for a good two, two and a half minutes now. Clock's ticking. What? Really? Really? Come on! Come on! No! Oh! Are you kidding me? What kind of psycho hits someone with a brick? Oh, you are such a baby. Me? Why you gotta throw things? Because fuck you, that's why. That not a very good reason. Time in! What the hell are you two doing? Leaving me out? I wanna play. Ow! Ow! Ow! Are you two crying? - No! - I'm not crying, you're crying! Okay. Guys, this is so us. Okay, thanks, you two. That was really fun, but I really have to go finish getting ready. See you inside. No! - Fuck you. - Fuck you! I need this! She's mine. - Hi. - Hi. - Hey! - Hello. What are you doing here? Do you two know each other? I don't think so. No. Hi. What are you doing here? I'm here to take Amber out. - What? - What? Now? And you're just gonna let him? Well, at this point, I don't think I really have a choice. We've been dating for eight months now. He takes me out every weekend. What? - He's the greatest. - I'm the greatest. My friends call me Fanst. Sorry I couldn't help with all your stuff today, babe. Last-minute conflict, you understand. Oh, it's okay. Luckily, the universe delivered me these two angels to help instead. Amazing how that happens. Two perfect helpers to help you with your insanely long list of things to do exactly when you needed them. The Universe truly works in mysterious ways. It sure does. It sure does. It does? I have to go finish getting ready. But thank you guys so much. Sweetie, take care of these boys for me, okay? Oh, I will. Sorry, guys, you were this close, but it looks like neither of you are going to take Amber out tonight. It's too bad. She's a fun girl. Great date. As a result of this, I regret to inform you that the Omega House has bids for neither of you. Sorry. Better luck next time. Remember, there's always spring rush. And there's always other fraternities. Hail Omega. You can show yourselves out. - We just got fucked, didn't we? - Yep. - He was dating her the whole time, wasn't he? - Yep. Neither of us ever had a chance of taking her out. Nope. You want to get some takeout? Good move. Ha. Thanks. Do you wanna talk about it? What is wrong with me? - Whelan? - Davis. Let me just give you this first, though, hold on a second. Why are you so uncomfortable with this? Dude, just honestly, don't get so close. - Shit, I said the wrong one first. - Idiot. Is this because I'm 1/64 racist? Wow! D'ah! - You guys would do that? - I won't finish. - Oh, fuck. - Pfft! I won't finish until... You won't finish until you do. I won't leave until everything I... Fuck. - That's not how I remember it. - "That's not how I remember..." It's really good. It's so awesome. - That's not how I remember it. - "That's not how I remember it." - Look, the tests... - I got it, I did it. Let's move on. Okay. I did it. I didn't break. Is that too much ass or is that okay? Is there ever such a thing as too much...? Hi, we're trying to have a bit of trouble agreeing... "We're having a bit of trouble," right? Exactly. I looked right at the camera. - All right, do it again. - Sorry. Hey, we're having a bit of trouble coming to an agreement on a... Is it... What the fuck? I was doing this right earlier, but I fucked it up. Ow! What? That was good. I'm doing it until I did it better than you in the original. Holy fucking shit! I'm so happy I made that. Whoa, whoa, okay, okay. Ooh! - Oh! - Sorry! I'm so sorry! That was my fault. Sorry. I'm sorry. He gets a hug? Oh, fuck. The game is nut slap. You're on. Oh, God, delayed reaction. Did I get your nuts? - They were on the bowl. - Aw. You're such a baby. I am not. What the fuck is that line? This actually feels amazing. I should do this more often. - It's not piss. - It's basically piss. You guys basically just basically confirmed it's piss. Can't argue with science. - Basically. - He's basically right. - It's not piss. - You basically just confirmed it's piss. You can't argue with science. Fucking shit! Action. - Ready! - What's going on? - And... I think your brains are frying. - Trying so hard. And... action. What is happening? That is so funny! I got it, I got it. - We still rolling? - Still rolling. Ready? And... action. What is happening? I can do it. You throw a right punch and then you grab with your right arm. - Okay. - Ready, and action. That was money. This was a really good idea. I know, right? So good. We should get some red velvet cake. - Motherfucker! - Ah!
