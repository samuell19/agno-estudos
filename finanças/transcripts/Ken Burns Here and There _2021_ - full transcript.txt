WELCOME TO THE RESTAURANT AT BURDICK'S. IT'S OUR PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU HERE WITH US. PART OF THE ORIGINAL PHILOSOPHY OF THIS RESTAURANT ABOUT 15 YEARS AGO WAS INVOLVING THE COMMUNITY, INVOLVING LOCAL FARMERS, AND BRINGING THE BEST FOOD WE CAN FIND WORLDWIDE AND SHARING THEM WITH OUR COMMUNITY, WHICH IS YOU. THE KITCHEN STAFF AND I ARE VERY PROUD TO BE PRESENTING YOU WITH THIS FANTASTIC FOOD TONIGHT. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE'RE HERE WITH KEN BURNS. KEN BURNS, TAKE IT AWAY. [APPLAUSE] FIRST OF ALL, IT'S REALLY GREAT TO BE WITH YOU TONIGHT. I SEE A LOT OF UNFAMILIAR FACES, AS WELL AS FAMILIAR FACES. I EXIST IN A TINY AREA BETWEEN THE TWO-LETTER, PLURAL PRONOUN "US" AND THE CAPITAL LETTERS "U.S." THAT'S THE PLACE THAT I INHABIT IN EVERY FILM THAT I'VE MADE. SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT FEELS GOOD ABOUT SAYING "US" AND "WE"... YOU KNOW, THE LATEST STORY IN ARTHUR SCHLESINGER JR. SAID, "THERE'S TOO MUCH PLURIBUS AND NOT ENOUGH UNUM TODAY." THERE'S NOBODY IN THIS ROOM, REGARDLESS OF YOUR POLITICAL PERSUASION, THAT DOESN'T KNOW THAT THAT'S TRUE. I'M IN THE BUSINESS OF UNUM, AND IT COMES DOWN TO TALKING ABOUT US AND TALKING ABOUT THE U.S. AND I THINK WHAT MY JOB... WORKING IN PUBLIC TELEVISION, LIVING IN THIS TOWN, WHICH COULD CARE LESS ABOUT HOW MANY EMMYS AND HOW MANY PEABODYS AND HOW MANY GRAMMYS AND OSCAR NOMINATIONS THERE ARE, AND THE SUBJECTS THEMSELVES THAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND THIS CARTOON FOR A WHILE, BUT FOR MANY YEARS, I HAD ON MY REFRIGERATOR AN OLD AND NOW FADED CARTOON, AND IT SHOWS TWO GUYS STANDING IN HELL, THE FLAMES LICKING UP AROUND THEM, AND ONE GUY SAYS TO THE OTHER, "APPARENTLY MY OVER-200 SCREEN CREDITS DIDN'T MEAN A DAMN THING." [LAUGHTER] AND THEY DON'T. I'LL NOW LET YOU ENJOY YOUR MEAL, AND I'LL COME AROUND AND SEE YOU AND... I AM THE WORLD'S BIGGEST RED SOX FAN. [MAN LAUGHS] WOMAN: OH! BUT IN MAYO, THEY'RE ALL ON SALARY, SO IT BREEDS A CULTURE OF COLLABORATION, SO THE PATIENT'S FIRST. IT'S NOT THE HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR BREATHING DOWN THE DOCTOR'S NECK, SAYING, "CONTROL THIS, CONTROL THAT." IT'S NOT THE INSURANCE GUY BREATHING DOWN THE HOSPITAL... IT'S THE PATIENT. I'VE BEEN HELP... I GO TO LOTS OF DIFFERENT SCHOOLS. THERE'S ONE ACROSS THE RIVER IN PUTNEY, VERMONT, WHERE MY BIG KIDS, WHO HAVE KIDS OF THEIR OWN, WENT... WELL, MY LATEST THING IS TO GET UP... AND BEFORE THE WORK STARTS IN THE EDITING ROOM... TO JUST WALK DOWN NORTH ROAD ALL THE WAY TO NORTH MAIN AND COME HERE... COME TO THE SHOP AND GET A CUP OF TEA AND... WITH MY DOG, AND THEN WALK BACK UP, WHICH IS, I ALWAYS SAY, THE MOST AEROBIC CUP OF TEA THERE IS. GOOD NIGHT, ALL. BE WELL. BYE. MAN: THANK YOU. MAN 2: SO, KEN, I KNOW WHAT THE OBVIOUS MEANING OF TONIGHT WAS. WHAT'S IN BETWEEN THE LINES ABOUT TONIGHT? I DON'T... I THINK IT'S ABOUT... I WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT, LIKE, WHAT'S THE SUBTEXT HERE? AND I THINK IT'S JUST ABOUT SERVING WALPOLE, YOU KNOW? THIS WAS EMPTY FOR, YOU KNOW, 17 YEARS, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND IT'S NOT EMPTY. IT'S, LIKE, THRIVING AND THERE'S... IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING INCREDIBLY SOPHISTICATED AND ELEGANT AND, AT THE SAME TIME, REALLY KIND OF BASIC. AND WHAT WAS GREAT AND WHAT I HADN'T REALLY REALIZED IS THAT PEOPLE CAME IN HERE, AND EVERY TABLE, THERE WERE MOSTLY STRANGERS; THEY WERE THIS COUPLE OR 4 MEETING ANOTHER 4 OR ANOTHER TWO, AND THEY WERE GETTING TOGETHER AND THAT'S EXACTLY THE WAY IT SHOULD BE. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW... CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE THAT I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS WITH, LIFE, THAT I FIRST STARTED OFF WITH A MEAL HERE. LIFE'S ALL ABOUT RECIPROCITY AND COMMUNICATION AND NOT SORT OF GETTING ABOVE SOMEBODY OR BELOW SOMEBODY. THERE'S ONLY COMMUNICATION OR CONNECTION AMONG EQUALS, AND IT WAS SORT OF JUST SORT OF SAYING THEY'RE NEIGHBORS. ♪ [BIRDS CHIRPING] BE NICE IF THIS WAS SO MUCH WARMER. SEE THAT? LOOK AT THAT.

AND THEN YOU'RE NOT AS DISTRACTED BY THE... MAYBE PUT A POLARIZER... THAT'S FINE. AND DO A STRAIGHT 85. YEAH. HI. NICE TO MEET YOU. DO YOU PLAY BASEBALL? MM-HMM.

ROLLING. ♪ [FILM PROJECTOR WHIRRING] ♪ BURNS: I WAS LIVING IN NEW YORK AFTER GRADUATING FROM HAMPSHIRE, TRYING TO RAISE THE MONEY AND THEN TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEGIN TO MAKE MY FILM ON THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE, AND WHEN A LOT OF THE SHOOTING... I WON'T SAY ALL OF IT, BUT A LOT OF THE SHOOTING... WAS DONE IN THE SPRING OF 1979, I WAS REALLY BROKE. I LIVED IN A 5-STORY WALK-UP IN CHELSEA BEFORE IT WAS CHELSEA, PAYING $275 A MONTH, AND I COULDN'T AFFORD IT WHEN THE GUY SAID IT WAS GOING UP TO $325. AND I KNEW I HAD TO GET A REAL JOB, BUT A REAL JOB MEANT TO ME THAT I WOULD BE STOPPING THE FILM, AND SO... THAT ALSO MEANT, YOU KNOW, YOU'D PUT THE FILM CANS ON A SHELF OR ABOVE THE REFRIGERATOR, AND THEN YOU'D WAKE UP AND YOU'D BE 45 OR 50 YEARS OLD, AND YOU HADN'T WRITTEN THAT NOVEL OR YOU HADN'T DONE THE THING OR YOU HADN'T FINISHED THE FILM ON THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE, SO I DECIDED TO MOVE WHERE A LOT OF MY FRIENDS WERE, THE AREA OF SOUTHERN VERMONT AND SOUTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND WALPOLE IS SORT OF THIS... NOBODY ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY LIVED IN WALPOLE, BUT WALPOLE WAS THE CIRCLE AROUND WHICH MANY OF MY FRIENDS' LIVES ORBITED. AND WE FOUND THE HOUSE THAT I'M LIVING IN NOW. WE RENTED IT FOR $275, SAME AMOUNT, AND I MOVED IN WITH MY GIRLFRIEND, SOON-TO-BE WIFE, AND WE HAD A BABY AND BOUGHT THE HOUSE AND HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO LEAVE. ♪ I USED TO THINK THAT THE BEST PROFESSIONAL DECISION I EVER MADE WAS TO MOVE TO WALPOLE IN AUGUST OF 1979. BUT AFTER WE STRUGGLED TO MAKE AN HOUR-LONG FILM ON THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE AND HAD IT COMPLETED, IT GOT NOMINATED FOR AN ACADEMY AWARD, AND EVERYBODY SAID, "COME BACK TO NEW YORK," "MOVE INTO L.A.," YOU KNOW, AND I SAID, "NO, I'M STAYING HERE." AND THAT'S THE BEST DECISION I EVER MADE, OF SORT OF KNOWING THAT THE KIND OF SPLENDID ISOLATION THAT I NEED TO DO THE KIND OF WORK WE DO, WHICH IS SO LABOR-INTENSIVE, SO TIME-INTENSIVE, TAKING 10 YEARS PLUS TO DO "THE NATIONAL PARKS," "VIETNAM," OTHER PROJECTS THAT WE'VE DONE, THAT STAYING HERE PROVIDED A KIND OF SAFE HARBOR THAT PERMITTED US TO DO THE KIND OF WORK WE DO WITHOUT KIND OF THE UNDUE INFLUENCES THAT YOU GET FROM THE PRESSURES OF THE INDUSTRY. SO I'VE LOST A BIG THING... THE SOCIETY OF MY COLLEAGUES, OTHER FILMMAKERS, OTHER FILM COMPANIES, THAT SORT OF STUFF IN NEW YORK OR L.A. OR ALL PLACES... BUT I'VE GAINED A FAMILY OF FILMMAKERS WHO'VE MADE THE TREK UP HERE AND DECIDED TO STAY AND JOIN IN WITH OUR LOT AND WE'VE CREATED A KIND OF COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN AND WORKING AS HARD AS IS NECESSARY TO MAKE THESE FILMS. I STILL LIVE IN THE SAME HOUSE, I STILL SLEEP IN THE SAME BEDROOM, AND 3 DAUGHTERS LATER AND LOTS OF FILMS LATER, I'M STILL HERE, AND I'M REALLY HAPPY. THE TOWN IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT THING. FIRST OF ALL, IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY BEAUTIFUL, IT'S WELL-SITUATED, THE LANDSCAPE IS AMAZING, BUT THE PEOPLE ARE GREAT, AND YOU'RE MEASURED HERE NOT BY HOW BOLD YOUR NAME IS, BUT WHO YOU ARE AS A HUMAN BEING, AND THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO BE JUDGED. MAN: WE NOW HAVE A NATIONAL, GLOBAL MEDIA INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS SO FOCUSED ON BIG CITIES ALL THE TIME. AND WE SEE OUR SMALL TOWNS, WHETHER WE GREW UP IN THEM OR WHETHER OR NOT WE KNOW THEM, ONLY THROUGH POPULAR CULTURE, AS THESE REFUGES AWAY FROM ALL OF THAT CONFUSION. I THINK WE LONG FOR THOSE KINDS OF INTERACTIONS WITH PEOPLE THAT WE DON'T HAVE AS OFTEN AS WE USED TO. ♪ BURNS: I LOVE NEW YORK. I LOVE THE ENERGY OF NEW YORK. IT'S SORT OF THE OPPOSITE OF WALPOLE AND A KIND OF NECESSARY BALANCE FOR ME. MY VERY FIRST FILM WAS ON THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE AND I THINK, OVER THE COURSE OF THE PRODUCTION, I WALKED OVER IT 5 OR 10 TIMES, MAYBE, IF THAT. I NOW WALK OVER IT 15 OR 20 TIMES A MONTH, AND WHAT'S GREAT IS THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN A SHOT THAT I SAY, "OH, I WISH WE'D HAD THAT." I THINK WE GOT IT, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT'S KIND OF MY DESSERT, MY REWARD FOR HAVING TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME IN THE CITY AS TO WALK OVER THIS GREAT, GREAT, GREAT WORK OF ART, THIS OLD GOTHIC TOWERS AND COMPRESSION AND THIS WONDERFUL, BEAUTIFUL MODERN STEEL IN TENSION AND THE BEAUTIFUL KIND OF SPIDER WEB OF THE CABLES. IT'S GREAT TO SEE THE PLACE JAMMED WITH TOURISTS. EVERY TIME I WALK OVER, IT'S A KIND OF BATTLE BETWEEN YOUR ORDINARY MIND, WHICH IS THINKING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND THAT PROBLEM AND WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO AND WHAT YOU'RE GONNA EAT AND WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN AND WHAT JUST HAPPENED AND ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF, BUT I ALWAYS MANAGE AT SOME POINT TO CLEAR EVERYTHING OUT AND JUST SORT OF RECEIVE THE BRIDGE, WHEREVER IT IS. IT MIGHT BE THE APPROACH TO THE NEW YORK TOWER; IT MIGHT BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE, LOOKING AT MANHATTAN OR BACK TO THE STATUE OF LIBERTY; OR IT MIGHT BE THE BROOKLYN TOWER, AND HOW YOUNG WE WERE AND KIND OF INVENTIVE ON HOW WE USED CARS AND WHERE WE FOUND OUR SHOTS, AND IT BRINGS A LOT OF THAT BACK. IT'S MY BRIDGE, AND I'LL TELL YOU, I DON'T MEAN THAT IN ANY KIND OF POSSESSIVE WAY, BUT I'LL START TO CRY. I MEAN, I WATCH "SOPHIE'S CHOICE," WHICH IS A GREAT, GREAT MOVIE, AND THERE'S A MOMENT WHEN MERYL STREEP AND KEVIN KLINE AND PETER MacNICOL... THE 3 CHARACTERS, PRINCIPAL CHARACTERS... ARE ON THE BRIDGE LATE AT NIGHT WITH ALL THE EXCITEMENT, EXUBERANCE, AND THEY'RE ALONE. AND I SAW IT IN A MOVIE THEATER IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND WEPT LIKE A BABY 'CAUSE I JUST THOUGHT, "THEY GOT IT, TOO; THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT I UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ALL BRIDGES IN THE WORLD." ♪ HAL HOLBROOK: THEY SUSPECTED IT WAS A TRAP, THAT THE STRANGERS WERE IN LEAGUE WITH THEIR ENEMIES.

[LOUD RECORDING OF HORSE SNORT] [ALL CHUCKLE] ♪ MAN, VOICE-OVER: KEN BURNS IS IN WALPOLE BECAUSE HE LOVES THE TOWN OF WALPOLE. IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT, I THINK. I MET HIM WHEN HE FIRST MOVED TO NEW HAMPSHIRE IN... I THINK IT WAS '79 OR SO, AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT HE CAME HERE WAS NOT BECAUSE HE WAS LOOKING FOR SMALL-TOWN VALUES. HE WAS LOOKING FOR A WAY THAT HE COULD MAKE HIS FIRST FILM AND NOT HAVE AS HIGH A COST OF LIVING AS HE WOULD IF HE DID WHAT MOST YOUNG FILMMAKERS WOULD DO, WHICH IS TO MOVE TO NEW YORK CITY. HE WOULD TELL ME HIS GREAT FEAR WAS THIS FILM THAT HE WANTED TO MAKE ABOUT THE BUILDING OF THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE ON A SHOESTRING BUDGET... THE NECESSITIES OF WHAT HE'D HAVE TO DO IN FREELANCE WORK AND OTHER THINGS, THAT HIS... IMAGE WAS THERE'D BE THESE CANS OF FILM UP ON THE... REFRIGERATOR THAT WERE STILL WAITING TO HAVE MORE CANS ON IT THAT WERE WAITING TO THEN BE MADE INTO A FILM. IN WALPOLE, HE COULD LIVE MORE CHEAPLY, AND WHAT HE FOUND WAS THAT HE COULD LIVE MORE CHEAPLY, HE COULD FINISH THAT FILM, BUT IT WORKED ITS WAY INTO HIS HEART AS WELL. ♪ DUNCAN, VOICE-OVER: WE'RE BOTH SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THIS PLACE THAT WE CALL HOME AND WHERE WE'VE RAISED OUR FAMILIES, AND KEN, AFTER HIS GREAT SUCCESS, YOU KNOW, COULD JUST AS EASILY HAVE SAID, "WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. "NOW THAT I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THOSE CANS "ON TOP OF MY REFRIGERATOR, I'M GOING TO NEW YORK CITY OR LOS ANGELES," BUT HE HAS STEADFASTLY WANTED TO KEEP HIS ROOTS HERE. OUR FILMS ARE HOME-GROWN TOMATOES, AND SO IT'S A FAMILY IN THAT... AN EXTENDED FAMILY IN THAT RESPECT, TOO, AND A COMMUNITY, AND TO KEN'S GREAT CREDIT, I THINK, HE HAS PLANTED HIMSELF HERE AND TAKEN ROOT, AND WE'RE ALL THE BETTER FOR IT. ♪ ALEXANDER: I THINK SMALL TOWNS HAVE AN ABILITY TO RECHARGE ONE'S BATTERIES. OFTEN, SMALL TOWNS DON'T SEEM, AT LEAST, TO BE AS COMPLEX A PLACE AS, FOR EXAMPLE, A MUCH BIGGER CITY WOULD BE, AND I OFTEN THINK THE INTERACTIONS ARE MUCH SIMPLER. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS OFTEN IN A SMALL TOWN. ♪ BURNS: I MOVED TO WALPOLE, TO WHERE I AM NOW, IN THIRD WEEK OF AUGUST, I THINK IT WAS, OF 1979, SO WE'RE COMING UP ON 40 YEARS. AND WE HAD A BIG OLD CHEVY VAN, GREEN CHEVY VAN THAT WE USED TO TRANSPORT THE FILM EQUIPMENT, AND OF COURSE, DOUBLE DUTY TO MOVE OUR MODEST "POSSESSIONS" OUT OF THIS FIFTH-STORY WALK-UP IN CHELSEA IN NEW YORK CITY AND MOVE IT INTO THIS GIGANTIC, TO US, HOUSE IN WALPOLE, WHICH HAD MORE CLOSET SPACE... LITERALLY MORE CLOSET SPACE... THAN WE HAD FLOOR SPACE IN NEW YORK CITY. AND WE'D SORT OF UNLOADED, IT WAS HOT, THE END OF THE DAY WAS THERE... IT WAS, LIKE, 7:00, 7:30... SHADOWS WERE BEGINNING TO LENGTHEN, AND I JUST DECIDED TO TAKE A DRIVE, AND I WENT DOWN NORTH ROAD AND WHEN I GOT TO NORTH ROAD, I TOOK A HARD RIGHT AT THE END ON OLD DREWSVILLE ROAD. I DON'T KNOW WHY. I GUESS I'D NEVER BEEN DOWN THERE, AND ONE OF THE THINGS I ALWAYS SAY, AND I STILL BELIEVE IT IS, NEXT TO THE ROAD HOME, THE ROAD I LIKE TO BE ON IS THE ONE I'VE NEVER BEEN ON BEFORE, SO I WAS GOING DOWN THIS ROAD I'D NEVER BEEN ON, AND AFTER ABOUT A MILE, IT GOES FROM PAVED TO DIRT, AND YOU KIND OF SLOW DOWN, YOU EASE UP ON THE ACCELERATOR, AND THEN, IN THE LATE EVENING TWILIGHT, FOR SOME REASON, I JUST STOPPED THE VAN, AND THEN I LOOKED TO MY LEFT, AND THERE WAS THIS SOLITARY GRAVESTONE, AND IT SAID, "THOMAS FLYNT DANIEL TWITCHELL, KILLED BY INDIANS, 1755." AND IT JUST... THE HAIR ON THE BACK OF MY NECK RAISED UP, AND I DAR... MY HEAD, LIKE, LOOKED TO THE RIGHT AGAIN, AND I COULD HAVE SWORN THAT JUST OUT OF MY PERIPHERAL VISION, AN INDIAN BRAVE HAD JUST DARTED AWAY. AND I REALIZED HOW RELATIVELY NEW IT WAS THAT PEOPLE COULD BE... WHITE SETTLEMENT COULD BE CONTESTED IN 1755 AS THIS TOWN WAS BEING FOUNDED, OR AT LEAST EXPLORED, AND THAT SEEMED LIKE AN INSTANT AGO AND IT REMINDED ME WHY I LOVE TO DEAL WITH HISTORY. IT MADE THE PRESENT PAST, AND THE PAST, MOST IMPORTANT, PRESENT IN THAT MOMENT. IT JUST CAME ALIVE, LOUD AND CLEAR. EVERY TIME I HEAD OUT NORTH OF HERE, I LEAVE BY OLD DREWSVILLE ROAD CONSCIOUSLY, AND I'VE NEVER FAILED... GOING AWAY OR COMING BACK... TO JUST SLOW AND NOD AND ACKNOWLEDGE ITS EXISTENCE. IT WAS A GREAT AWAKENING FOR ME, A REAL PRESENT, A REAL GIFT. AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE SOMETIMES GIVEN GIFTS; YOU KNOW, IT MAY BE A SPECTACULAR SUNSET, IT MAY BE JUST SEEING SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARILY BEAUTIFUL OR THE WAY THE LIGHT FALLS OR WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE, OR THERE... SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR ME, WHO WAS EMBARKING ON A PROFESSIONAL LIFE THAT, AT THAT POINT, I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT 40-PLUS YEARS LATER, I WOULD STILL BE DOING THE SAME THING. ♪ DUNCAN: I THINK, AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY, THAT WE ARE LOSING A SENSE OF COMMUNITY IN THE LARGER SENSE THAT HAS ALMOST NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SIZE OF THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU LIVE IN. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS AT PLAY: THE INTERNET, THE POLITICAL CULTURE, THE DECLINE OF CERTAIN INSTITUTIONS, WHETHER THAT'S THE CHURCH OR CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS. ALL OF THAT ARE HAVING A HARMONIC CONVERGENCE, I THINK, RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT THAT MAKES IT HARDER FOR US TO THINK OF OURSELVES OF "WHAT DO WE HAVE IN COMMON? WHAT DO WE SHARE?" VERSUS "LET ME ILLUMINATE FOR YOU ALL THE THINGS THAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT YOU." AND WE YEARN FOR COMMUNITY, AND THERE'S A LOT IN OUR WORLD, PARTICULARLY TODAY, THAT DOESN'T SELECT FOR THAT. WE HAVE THIS THING CALLED SOCIAL MEDIA, WHICH ISN'T; IT'S ASOCIAL MEDIA, IT'S DRIVING US APART. IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN IN A ROOM WITH TWO TEENAGERS TEXTING TO THEMSELVES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUCH, YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT SOCIAL MEDIA, THAT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. BUT THE WAY IT BREEDS DIVISION, THE WAY IT RETURNS US OUT OF THE CIVILIZED STATE THAT OUR FOUNDERS AND THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME BEFORE US HAVE DELIVERED US TO AND BACK INTO SOME TRIBAL CONFIGURATIONS, THAT'S SOMETHING WE GOT TO REALLY, REALLY WORK ON, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK THE IMPULSE FOR PEOPLE IS TO BE TOGETHER. IT'S A SAD THING THAT WE'VE LOST CIVICS IN OUR TEACHING; NOT JUST HISTORY, WHICH HAS TURNED INTO SOCIAL STUDIES, WHICH TURNED INTO NOTHING, BUT CIVICS, AND IT'S A DIRTY WORD NOW. I ADMIT IT. NOBODY... I MEAN, IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU SAY, "COME AND CAN TAKE YOUR CIVICS," YOU KNOW, "YOU CAN HOLD YOUR NOSE, YOU KNOW, IT'LL BE OK." BUT IT'S NOT 100 SENATORS AND 435 REPRESENTATIVES. IT'S HOW YOU GET THINGS DONE WITH OTHER PEOPLE. WE NEED TO BE REMINDED OF OUR STORIES BECAUSE WE'RE IN PERHAPS THE GREATEST EXISTENTIAL THREAT WE'VE EVER HAD SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND THE CIVIL WAR. SO WE ARE GOING TO BE THE AUTHORS OF OUR OWN DEMISE. IN FACT, THERE'S AN AMAZING QUOTE BY ABRAHAM LINCOLN THAT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE QUOTES IN THE WHOLE, WIDE WORLD, AND IT ENDS THE INTRODUCTION OF "THE CIVIL WAR" SERIES. HE WAS A YOUNG MAN, HE HADN'T EVEN TURNED 29, IT WAS IN 1838. HE WAS ADDRESSING A GROUP OF, YOU KNOW, FELLOW SORT OF MIDDLE-CLASS FOLKS IN... IN SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS... THE YOUNG MEN'S LYCEUM... AND THE TOPIC THAT DAY WAS... FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND THAT SORT OF THING. HE SAID, "WHEN SHALL WE EXPECT THE APPROACH OF DANGER? "SHALL SOME TRANSATLANTIC GIANT STEP THE EARTH AND CRUSH US AT A BLOW?" THEN HE ANSWERED HIS OWN QUESTION: "NEVER. "ALL THE ARMIES OF EUROPE, ASIA, AND AFRICA COULD NOT, BY FORCE, "TAKE A DRINK FROM THE OHIO RIVER OR MAKE A TRAIL "IN THE BLUE RIDGE IN THE TRIAL OF A THOUSAND YEARS. "IF DESTRUCTION BE OUR LOT, WE MUST OURSELVES BE "ITS AUTHOR AND FINISHER. AS A NATION OF FREE MEN, WE WILL LIVE THROUGH ALL TIME OR DIE BY SUICIDE." [VOICE TREMBLES] I MEAN, IT'S AMAZING. AND HE WOULD GO ON, OF COURSE, TO PRESIDE OVER THE CLOSEST WE'VE COME TO NATIONAL SUICIDE... THE CIVIL WAR... BUT IT'S KIND OF, IN SOME WAYS, OPTIMISTIC, YOU KNOW, THAT THESE TWO OCEANS ARE GOING TO PROTECT US, SO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE SOME FOREIGN THREATS; WHAT WE HAVE IS OUR OWN THREAT, AND IF YOU DON'T GET THAT... THAT US, INDIVIDUALLY, WE'RE OUR OWN WORST ENEMIES, AND COLLECTIVELY WE ARE... THEN YOU MISS THE KIND OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE NEED TO SORT OF REALIZE TODAY AND SEIZE THE BULL BY THE HORNS: "HEY, LOOK, YOU KNOW WHAT? I WANT MY COUNTRY BACK." "I DON'T WANT THE TRIBALISM. I LIKE THE IDEA "THAT WE'RE CIVILIZED, I LIKE THE IDEA THAT, WITH ALL THESE IMMIGRANT GROUPS, WE'RE STRONGER ALLOY." YOU KNOW, INDIVIDUAL METALS, YEP, STRONG, BUT NOTHING'S LIKE AN ALLOY IN PUTTING STUFF TOGETHER AND HAVING THAT TENSILE STRENGTH THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE, AND THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF US. WOMAN: IT'S PRESSURE. ANYONE YOU KNOW, ANYONE IN THIS BUSINESS, THERE'S PRESSURE, BUT IT'S NOT AS HIGH-STRESS OUT HERE AS NEW YORK AND L.A. AND PLACES LIKE THAT, SO... MAN: SO YOU LIKE WALPOLE? IS THIS... HAD YOU BEEN TO WALPOLE BEFORE THIS PROJECT, YOU CAME UP TO WORK ON THIS? WOMAN: WELL, I WENT TO SCHOOL AT KING STATE, WHICH IS ONLY 20 MINUTES AWAY, AND SO, YOU KNOW, I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA. AND THEN WE SHOT A STUDENT FILM IN WALPOLE, AND WALPOLE JUST LOVES THE FILM PEOPLE. I MEAN, THEY WERE REALLY VERY EXCITED WHEN WE CAME IN TO DO OUR LITTLE STUDENT FILM, AND WORKING HERE, YOU KNOW, YOU GO INTO THE TOWN AND YOU MAIL THINGS AND YOU HAVE LUNCH AND YOU MEET PEOPLE, AND THEY ALL KNOW AN OUTSIDER, SO THEY'LL SAY, "OH, ARE YOU WORKING OVER AT KEN'S PLACE?" AND YOU'LL SAY, "YEAH" AND THEY'LL ASK YOU ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW, AND THEY'RE JUST VERY WARM AND... AND EXCITED ABOUT IT AND I THINK THEY TAKE A LOT OF PRIDE IN THE FACT THAT KEN'S HERE AND HE HAS BROUGHT, YOU KNOW, HIS COMPANY HERE AND... [DISTORTED VOICES PLAYING AT HIGH SPEED] [TRUMPET PLAYING A LIVELY JAZZ TUNE] ♪ [TRUMPET FADES] BURNS: THE PEOPLE OF WALPOLE ARE BOTH A COLLECTIVE THING, THIS KIND OF PARENT, THIS KIND OF GUARDIAN ANGEL FOR ME, WHO IS AN ORPHAN, AND... AND ALSO INDIVIDUALS AND A VARIETY OF INDIVIDUALS OVER TOWN, AND SO I CAN WALK AROUND THE TOWN GREEN, AND REMEMBER WHO LIVED IN THE HOUSE BEFORE THEM AND WHO WAS THERE BEFORE THEM. AND NOW I'M AN OLD GUY IN WALPOLE AND THERE'S LOTS OF KIDS RUNNING AROUND AND MAKING A LOT OF NOISE, AND THAT ALWAYS FEELS GREAT, AND HOUSES GET BUILT AND OTHER HOUSES GET IMPROVED UPON. IT'S A LIVING, BREATHING ORGANISM, AND I THINK MANY OF US DON'T HAVE THE TIME OR THE LUXURY, AND THEREFORE I COUNT IT AS ONE OF THE GREAT BLESSINGS OF MY LIFE THAT I DO, TO SORT OF FEEL... I FEEL THIS ABOUT MY COUNTRY IN A LONGER AND LONGER SENSE, BUT I FEEL IT ABOUT WALPOLE, THAT IT'S AN ENTITY, THAT IT'S AN ORGANISM, THAT IT BREATHES, AND I'M JUST HAPPY TO BE CONNECTED TO IT. PAULA BURDICK: THERE'S THE NORTH POLE, THE SOUTH POLE, AND WALPOLE, THE EPICENTER OF THE WORLD. IN MANY WAYS, THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE IN WALPOLE, THEY WANT IT TO BE A BEST-KEPT SECRET, OK, AND THERE'S A TRADITION THAT MANY PEOPLE TRAVEL TO WALPOLE BY TAKING A TURN AT THE BLINKING LIGHT ON SOUTH STREET. THE PEOPLE AT WALPOLE, THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY DECIDED THEY DON'T WANT A SIGN THAT INDICATES HOW TO GET TO THIS SWEET VILLAGE, OK? AND SO THAT TELLS YOU THAT THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE HERE LOVE IT, THEY DON'T WANT A LOT OF COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND WE'VE TRIED TO KEEP THE VILLAGE WHERE WE ARE AND THE RESTAURANT IS LOCATED AS PRISTINE AND GENUINE AS POSSIBLE, AND I THINK WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED THAT. THE ONE THING THAT A TOWN LIKE WALPOLE CAN TEACH THE REST OF AMERICA IS THE COMMUNITY SPIRIT. MAN: I THINK ANY VISITOR TO WALPOLE WILL APPRECIATE WALPOLE FOR ITS AUTHENTICITY. IT DOESN'T LIE. IT IS WHAT IT IS. WOMAN: THERE'S A SAYING THAT HOME ISN'T A PLACE, IT'S A FEELING, AND DEFINITELY WALPOLE IS A FEELING OF COMMUNITY, OF CONNECTEDNESS, OF BEING ABLE TO PURSUE YOUR LIFE IN A BEAUTIFUL SURROUNDING, AND THEN ALSO GET OUT OF THE SPED-UP PART OF OUR LIVES THAT SO MANY OF US MAY GET CONSUMED BY, AND SO WALPOLE IS JUST A WONDERFUL PLACE TO CALL HOME. ♪ VICKI GOHL: WALPOLE IS VERY PROUD OF KEN BURNS, AND KEN IS GROUNDED BY THIS TOWN. MAN: KEN KIND OF GREW WITH THE TOWN, OR THE TOWN GREW WITH KEN. WHEN KEN FIRST CAME HERE, HE WASN'T A CELEBRITY. HE WAS STRUGGLING, AND IT'S BEEN FUN TO WATCH HIM GROW. BUT IF YOU TAKE WALPOLE OUT OF KEN, I THINK IT CHANGES KEN. A LOT OF HIS IDENTITY AND HIS... I THINK HE WOULD SAY HIS SERENITY COMES FROM, YOU KNOW, THE LOCAL LIFE AND THAT LOCAL CONNECTION. I WON'T CALL HIM AN ORDINARY CITIZEN BECAUSE HE IS NOT, BUT HE DOES INVOLVE HIMSELF IN THINGS AND CONTRIBUTES, AND I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL. THE FACT THAT HE IS UNPRETENTIOUS AND COMFORTABLE IN HIS OWN SKIN. AND I FIND HIM AN INCREDIBLE FORCE IN THE WORLD AND ESPECIALLY ONE THAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW. AND HE IS, OFTEN MORE THAN THE TOWN KNOWS, AN INVISIBLE BENEFACTOR, SOMEBODY WHO PROTECTS IT AND SUPPORTS IT IN MANY, MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. WOMAN: KEN BURNS IS IMPORTANT TO WALPOLE BECAUSE HE HELPS US REMEMBER TO REMEMBER OUR HISTORY. HOUGHTON: HE'S HUMBLE AND KIND, AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE HAS GAINED CELEBRITY, HE IS STILL THE SAME KEN BURNS THAT CAME TO TOWN 40 YEARS AGO. WYCKOFF: KEN BEING KEN BURNS MAYBE MEANS SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO EVERYONE THAT YOU ASK; I THINK THE REST OF THE WORLD SEES A SIDE OF KEN BURNS... THE FAMOUS FILMMAKER, THE WONDERFUL DOCUMENTARIAN... AND WHAT WE SEE HERE IN WALPOLE IS A FRIEND. BURNS, VOICE-OVER: I AM SHAPED ENTIRELY BY WALPOLE. IT HAS PROTECTED ME. THERE'S NOTHING I'VE DONE TO WALPOLE, NOTHING. I'VE TRIED TO KEEP A LIGHT FOOTPRINT HERE, AND I'VE TRIED TO BE GOOD TO THE COMMUNITY AND NOT STICK MY NECK OUT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, AND THE MORE IMPORTANT THING IS THERE'S SOME GUY WHO COMES UP AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING IN THE MIDDLE OF A SNOWSTORM AND PLOWS MY DRIVEWAY, AND SOMEBODY ELSE WILL COME AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING WHEN MY PIPES ARE FROZEN, WHEN I FIRST MOVED IN HERE AND NOBODY KNEW ME FROM ADAM AND THAW THOSE PIPES OUT AND FIX THE LEAK. AND, YOU KNOW, WHEN MY DAUGHTER HAD AN EMERGENCY, THE E.M.T. GUYS WERE HERE IN 6 MINUTES AND THEY WERE ON IT. I MEAN, THAT'S THE STUFF THAT MATTERS: THAT I CAN GET A GOOD MEAL IN TOWN, THAT PEOPLE WILL SAY HELLO TO ONE ANOTHER AND THAT IT ISN'T JUST WHEN YOU'RE WALKING IN TOWN, BUT WHEN YOU'RE DRIVING. WHEN I WALK, MY ARM IS GOING UP AND DOWN, FLAPPING, YOU KNOW, AT EVERY CAR THAT PASSES, AND... I DON'T KNOW MOST OF THEM, BUT I WANT TO SAY WE'RE NEIGHBORS. AFTER A WHILE, IF YOU'RE A FAMOUS PERSON IN A SMALL TOWN, AFTER A WHILE, NOBODY GIVES A DAMN THAT YOU'RE A FAMOUS PERSON IN A SMALL TOWN. WHAT YOU REALLY NEED IS, "WHERE ARE YOU GONNA GET THE GOOD COFFEE? "WHO'S GONNA BE YOUR PLUMBER? WHO'S GONNA BE YOUR ELECTRICIAN? I NEED A GOOD WOODWORKER. WHO'S GONNA BE THE DOCTOR FOR ME?" THESE PEOPLE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THAT TOWN. YOU CAN GO BACK AS THE BIG CELEB, BUT AFTER THAT WEARS OFF, NOBODY CARES. ♪ WOMAN: I DEFINITELY THINK WALPOLE MAKES KEN WHO HE IS. I MEAN, HE COMES HERE TO BE HIMSELF. I THINK WALPOLE IS HIS PLACE TO BE OFF-CAMERA, HIS PLACE TO BE HIMSELF, HIS PLACE TO BE KEN, WHO RELAXES IN THE CHAIR ON THE FRONT PORCH AND PEOPLE RIDE THEIR BICYCLES BY AND WAVE, AND THAT'S KEN. WHATEVER IT IS, NOBODY HERE IS EXPECTING HIM TO DO ANYTHING. EVERYBODY HERE ALLOWS HIM TO BE WHO HE IS. MAN: HIS ABILITY TO TREAT EVERYONE THE SAME, THAT EVERYONE HE'S SPEAKING TO HAS HIS ATTENTION, WHETHER IT'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OR SOMEONE OPERATING AN ELEVATOR. EVERYONE IS SPECIAL, EVERYONE'S STORY COUNTS, AND THAT MAKES HIM AN EXTRAORDINARY GUY, AND I THINK THAT'S THE LESSON THAT COMES FROM A KEN BURNS FILM, IS THAT WE ALL STEP BACK AND WE LISTEN TO THE STORIES. AND OFTEN, IN OUR LIVES, WE DON'T LISTEN ENOUGH, AND YET, DURING THAT TWO HOURS OR THAT 18 HOURS, WE'RE LISTENING TO THE STORIES OF ORDINARY PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE OURSELVES... AS KEN SAYS, THEY'RE PEOPLE WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE OVER FOR THANKSGIVING DINNER... BUT WE REALIZE WHEN WE'RE LISTENING TO THEIR STORIES THAT THEY'RE NOT ORDINARY AT ALL, THEY'RE EXTRAORDINARY, AND BY ASSOCIATING WITH THESE EXTRAORDINARY PEOPLE, WE FEEL EXTRAORDINARY OURSELVES. ♪ BURNS: COME HERE.

I MEAN, THEY FINALLY GOT AROUND TO GETTING IT AND THEY NAMED A HURRICANE AFTER WILLA, AND IT'S, LIKE, BATTERING OUTSIDE THE WINDOWS RIGHT NOW AND WE GO, "YEP, THAT'S HER." ♪ BURNS: SO THIS IS A MYTHIC HOME FOR ME. I DON'T THINK I WOULD BE WHO I AM WITHOUT IT. YOU KNOW PEOPLE COME HERE AND, TO A PERSON, THEY GO, "WHAT DO PEOPLE DO HERE," YOU KNOW? AND I GO, "EVERYTHING THEY DO IN NEW YORK, PLUS FARMING." ALEXANDER, VOICE-OVER: THE IDEA THAT A PLACE IS PART OF WHO YOU ARE HAS BECOME A RARE SENTIMENT IN THE 21st CENTURY. I THINK WE ARE VERY DIVIDED ON A NUMBER OF LINES. A BIG CHASM UNDERLYING THOSE DIVISIONS IS A LACK OF A SENSE OF PLACE. THIS IS TRUE ALL OVER THE WORLD. OTHER NATIONS HAVE SMALL TOWNS, TOO: RURAL PLACES, AGRARIAN PLACES, LITTLE VILLAGES. WHEN THAT ALL GOES AWAY, A LOT OF WHAT WE ARE AND WERE AS A COUNTRY ALSO GOES AWAY. WE DO, ALL OF US, SEEK A PLACE OF REPAIR. WE DO LOOK FOR THOSE PLACES AND MOMENTS THAT PERMIT US TO THROTTLE BACK ON LIFE, TO BE ABLE TO SEE THESE KIND OF DEEP QUESTIONS IN A LESS URGENT OR A LESS ANXIOUS WAY, AND I FIND, FOR ME, WALPOLE IS PART OF THAT. THERE'S A KIND OF BREATHING THAT HAPPENS HERE... NOT JUST PERSONALLY AND INTIMATELY, BUT KIND OF PROFESSIONALLY, AS WELL... THAT I THINK PERMITS ME TO DO MY BEST WORK AND, I HOPE, BE MY BEST SELF, BUT OTHER PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO BE THE JUDGE OF THAT. YOU CAN GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND YOU CAN DO YOUR STRUGGLES. WHEN YOU COME BACK TO THAT SMALL TOWN, I THINK A LOT OF THAT PRESSURE LEAVES YOU AND HELPS YOU RECHARGE YOURSELF. BELLINI: IN THE QUIET MOMENTS, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT STUFF, YOU THINK ABOUT, LIKE, THIS... BURNS: YEAH. WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE YOU? WHEN YOU PLACE YOURSELF IN NATURE, IF YOU PUT YOURSELF IN FRONT OF THIS, WHICH IS WHAT EMILY DICKINSON CALLS "SUNRISES AND SUNSETS, THE FAR THEATRICALS OF DAY," WHICH... I JUST LOVE THAT... IF YOU PUT YOURSELF IN THIS, YOU ARE IMMEDIATELY REMINDED OF YOUR OWN INSIGNIFICANCE. LIVING CLOSER RELATIONSHIP TO NATURE, THAT PERMITS YOU TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOURSELF. OLIVIA: WILL WE GO DOWN TO THE DOCK? WELL, ACTUALLY, THE DOCK'S BACK THERE. WE'RE JUST GONNA GO AND LOOK FOR A PLACE TO FILM. YOU SEE, A GOOD PLACE WHERE WE CAN SEE THE MOUNTAINS. THIS IS A VERY GOOD... THIS IS A REALLY GOOD PLACE, AND OLIVIA IS GONNA HOLD THE SLATE. NOW YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT... BUDDY HAS TO SEE YOUR FACE. OTHERWISE WE CAN'T GET STARTED, AND JUST HOLD IT. CAN YOU CLICK IT FOR ME, OLIVIA? JUST TO... DON'T MOVE. HE'S GONNA... OK, LOOK BACK AT BUD. BURNS, VOICE-OVER: I THINK WE'RE ALWAYS FOND OF SAYING THAT HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF... IT DOES NOT... OR "WE'RE CONDEMNED TO REPEAT WHAT WE DON'T REMEMBER," A WONDERFUL PHRASE; IMPORTANT TO AT LEAST THINK ABOUT THAT, BUT IT'S NOT TRUE. EVERYTHING'S NEW, EVERYTHING'S NEW, BUT WE DO PERCEIVE PATTERNS, WE DO PERCEIVE REPETITIONS, WE DO PERCEIVE MOTIFS, AND THOSE ARE NOT EVENTS, THOSE ARE HUMAN BEINGS REMAINING THE SAME. ECCLESIASTES SAYS, "WHAT HAS BEEN WILL BE AGAIN, "WHAT HAS BEEN DONE WILL BE DONE AGAIN. THERE'S NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN." AND THEN WE SEE THESE REPETITIONS, AND I LIKE WHAT TWAIN SAID: "IT DOESN'T REPEAT ITSELF, BUT IT RHYMES." EVERY TIME WE FINISH A FILM, WE NEVER SPEND A SECOND DURING THE FILM WORRIED ABOUT THE RHYME, AND THEN WE LIFT UP AND GO, "WOW, ISN'T THAT SO MUCH LIKE TODAY?" AND IT ALWAYS IS, BUT I CAN DO THAT OF ANY FILM. IT ISN'T JUST "VIETNAM" WITH THE TOPICALITY OF THE PROTESTS, AND "THE PRESIDENTS" AND IN "THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE." IT'S IN "THE SHAKERS" AND IT'S IN "THE ROOSEVELTS," IT'S IN "PROHIBITION," IT'S IN EVERY FILM WE'VE DONE. IF YOU DO THE STORY WELL, CONSCIENTIOUSLY, AUTHENTICALLY, HONORABLY, THEN IT'S GOT TO SPEAK TO THE PRESENT 'CAUSE HOW CAN... I MEAN, FAULKNER SAID MUCH BETTER THAN ME AND MUCH... HEH! QUICKER THAN ME: "HISTORY IS NOT WAS, BUT IS." MAN: OR THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF WHAT HE SAYS. HE IS THE HAPPY WARRIOR ON THE POLITICAL BATTLEFIELD... ALFRED E. SMITH! THAT'S TERRIFIC, TERRIFIC, TERRIFIC. VERY, VERY NICE. AND FOR THE FIRST PART, WE'RE NOT OUT THERE. WE'RE NOT PROJECTING, YOU KNOW. YEAH. WE'RE NOT SORT OF DOING THAT. IT STILL HAS THAT... YES, OK. INTERIOR, DIARY/LETTER QUALITY. AS HE GETS VERY OLDER, YOU KNOW, AND HE'S LOST HIS SON, I THINK THERE WILL BE WEARY... QUALITY OF WHAT... HIS LIFE CHANGES. WILL CHANGE, AND YOU'LL JUST GO INTO THAT AND WE'LL EITHER QUIET IT OR LOOSE IT OR... VOICE OF THEODORE ROOSEVELT, PAUL GIAMATTI. THIS IS VOICE 1.01, TAKE ONE. FROM THAT TIME, FOR THE NEXT 7 GENERATIONS, FROM FATHER TO SON, EVERY ONE OF US WAS BORN ON MANHATTAN ISLAND. - THEODORE ROOSEVELT. BURNS: SO WE'RE GONNA START WITH A LITTLE SOUTHERN AND KIND OF A LITTLE EUGENE SLEDGE. I DON'T HAVE HIS MIC ON YET, SO... AND THEN WE'LL MOVE BACK TO SOME STRAIGHT STUFF THAT WE WANTED TO HAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. HAPPILY. THINGS GOING WELL? YEAH, GOOD. GOOD. IT'S BEEN A WONDERFUL, WILD YEAR, SO... GOOD. YEAH. THIS IS VOICE 1.34, TAKE ONE. DEAR MR. PRESIDENT, A FEW MINUTES BEFORE MIDNIGHT ON MONDAY, AUGUST 13... DEAR MR. PRESIDENT, IT ALMOST SEEMED THE OTHER NIGHT, SITTING IN MY EASY CHAIR IN THE LIBRARY... I'M GOING TO BE ON TURNER CLASSIC MOVIES COMING UP SOON, AND IN IT, I HAVE THINGS TO DO. AND IT SAID, "MONEY COMING, RESIDUALS ARRIVING." AND I GOT ALL EXCITED AND I RAN TO THE THING AND I OPENED IT, AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. I LOOKED DOWN. IT WAS FOR TWO CENTS. [LAUGHTER] TWO [BLEEP] CENTS. [LAUGHTER] BURNS: YEAH, I REMEMBER THE FIRST DAY OF FILM SCHOOL. WE HAD A BIG, HUGE ARGUMENT, AND IT WAS, LIKE, NOT FROM SCHOOL, LIKE, A FILM CLASS AT HAMPSHIRE COLLEGE. IT'S SEPTEMBER OF 1971, AND I VERY NAIVELY SAID, "OH, YEAH, FILM'S GONNA MAKE YOU DO SOMETHING," BUT IT WAS GENERALLY ACCEPTED AT THE END OF THE DISCUSSION THAT I WAS NAIVE, THAT, IN FACT, FILMS DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, THEY PREACHED TO THE CONVERTED, AND THEY JUST, YOU KNOW, REINFORCED WHAT YOU BELIEVED IN OR REINFORCED WHAT YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE IN, BUT THEY DIDN'T MAKE YOU REALLY DO ANYTHING THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ALREADY DONE. SO IT WAS GENERALLY ASSUMED THAT I WAS WRONG AND NAIVE, BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN MY FIRST FILM WAS BROADCAST ON THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE, THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE, YOU KNOW, AROUND THE TIME OF THE BROADCAST, TURNED 100... MAY 24, 1983. AND THERE WAS A FRONT-PAGE ARTICLE, AND IT SHOWED A COUPLE AND THEIR KIDS WALKING ACROSS THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE. THEY WERE FROM IDAHO, AND THEY SAID THAT THEY'D SEEN A DOCUMENTARY ON THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE ON PUBLIC TELEVISION AND DECIDED THEY'D ALWAYS WANTED TO GO TO NEW YORK AND DECIDED TO TAKE THEIR KIDS AND TELL THEM HOW IT WAS BUILT. AND I JUST... I CUT OUT THAT THING AND I JUST SAID TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE, "I WAS RIGHT. YOU CAN." THAT'S WHERE THE EMOTIONAL ARCHEOLOGY COMES IN. YOU CAN ACTUALLY MOVE PEOPLE. WE HAD ATTENDANCE AT THE NATIONAL PARKS SKYROCKETING AFTER WORLD WAR II, AND EVERYBODY WAS PUTTING PEOPLE AND THE KIDS IN THE STATION WAGON, OR LATER THE MINIVAN, AND MAKING THAT ICONIC 6-WEEK TRIP, BUT AS WE GOT BUSIER AND BUSIER, AS THE INTERNET INTRUDED IN OUR LIVES, AND, YOU KNOW, THAT KIND OF LEVELED OFF IN THE NINETIES, TOWARDS THE LATE NINETIES, AND BEGAN TO EVEN DIP A LITTLE BIT IN THE MID-AUGHTS, AND OUR SERIES CAME OUT TOO LATE FOR THE SUMMER SEASON OF '09 AND SEPTEMBER OF '09, BUT THE NEXT YEAR, THE ATTENDANCE WENT UP 15 MILLION PEOPLE, AND THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR CALLED ME UP AND HE SAID, "IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT." I JUST WENT, "YAY," YOU KNOW. THAT MEANT... THAT WAS MORE THAN A THIRD OF OUR AUDIENCE, THE FIRST TIME IT WAS SHOWN, GOT UP OFF THEIR DUFFS AND WENT OUT AND DID SOMETHING. LOTS OF PEOPLE, AFTER OUR "NATIONAL PARKS" FILM CAME OUT, DECIDED, "WE NEED TO GET OUR FAMILY IN THE CAR OR ON AN AIRPLANE AND GO SEE THESE THINGS OURSELVES." AND WE HEAR ALL THE TIME FROM PEOPLE WHO DID THAT OR FROM PARK SERVICE PEOPLE THAT SAY THAT PEOPLE ARE SHOWING UP, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'RE MENTIONING IS OUR FILM. HEH! I MEAN, UH... THAT'S WHAT YOU DO IT FOR, RIGHT? WE CARE ABOUT THE... THIS IS... THIS IS HONEYSUCKLE, WHICH PUTS... I THINK, OR A VARIATION... PUTS US IN BEAR FOOD. YEAH. OH, THAT'S NICE. LOOK AT THAT. LOOK STRAIGHT UP. I JUST LOVE THESE... CASCADE. FEELING IT RIGHT NOW. IT'S VERY NICE. [WATER SLOSHING] ♪ OH, YEAH. LET'S CLIMB UP THERE, BUD. I WOULD DO IT. DUNCAN, VOICE-OVER: BOY, MY FRIENDSHIP WITH HIM HAS NOW GONE ON FOR MANY YEARS AND TAKEN US TO WONDERFUL PLACES AND MAKING FILMS THAT WE WERE BOTH PASSIONATE ABOUT, AND IT'S BROUGHT US BACK HERE TO THIS ROOM SO MANY TIMES WHEN WE WORKED TOGETHER TO TRY TO DO THE BEST THAT WE CAN TO TELL THE STORY THAT WE'VE GONE OUT AND DISCOVERED. HE LOVES TO TAKE ON A TOPIC AND LEARN EVERYTHING HE CAN ABOUT IT AND HE LOVES THEN THE PROCESS OF REFINING WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED TO TRY TO TELL A STORY, AND TO TRY TO TELL A STORY THAT WILL BE ACCURATE, BE COMPELLING, MAY INCLUDE THE... WHAT HE CALLS EMOTIONAL ARCHEOLOGY TO REMIND US THAT ALL THE PEOPLE IN HISTORY THAT WE LEARN ABOUT WERE NOT CARDBOARD FIGURES, THEY WERE REAL HUMAN BEINGS. DAYTON DUNCAN IS, YOU KNOW... I MEAN, WE'RE BROTHERS, YOU KNOW, SO COMPLETELY WEDDED TOGETHER. WE COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER, WE'RE FIERCELY DEVOTED TO WHAT WE KNOW AND WE FEEL, AND WE ALSO HAVE A DEEP RESPECT, WHEN THAT THING THAT WE FEEL ISN'T EXACTLY WHAT THE OTHER FEELS, TO PERMIT THE OTHER TO HAVE THAT FEELING AND REALIZE THAT THE OTHER MIGHT BE RIGHT IN THE END. AND SO WE... IT'S JUST BEEN THIS EXTRAORDINARY PARTNERSHIP ALMOST FROM THE FIRST TIME I MET HIM. WE DIDN'T START WORKING FOR ANOTHER 10 YEARS TOGETHER, BUT WHEN WE DID START WORKING, WE HAVEN'T STOPPED. AND AS HE'S CONTEMPLATING RETIREMENT, I'M SORT OF, LIKE, SAYING, "OK, WELL, HOLD THIS," AND HE GOES, "WELL, I'M GONNA REALLY RETIRE," I SAY, "OK, HOLD THIS. I STILL HAVE HIM INVOLVED, AND I HOPE TO KEEP HIM SOMEHOW TRICKED AND, LIKE, "LOOK OVER THERE, OK, NOW YOU'RE WRITING THIS. "OK, LOOK OVER THERE. OK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO PRODUCE. NO, NO, NO, BUT THIS REALLY NEEDS YOUR HELP." THAT HE AND I BOTH BELIEVE THAT THE WORK YOU DO, IF YOU LOVE IT AND YOU THINK IT HAS A PURPOSE, THEN THAT IS... THAT IS WHERE YOUR DESTINY, IF YOU'RE LUCKY, ULTIMATELY LEADS YOU. BURNS: I THINK A LOT OF US THINK THAT HAPPINESS IS THIS GOD-GIVEN RIGHT, WE SHOULD BE HAPPY AND CHEERFUL, AND THAT, CLEARLY, ONE OF THE EASY WAYS IS MATERIAL STUFF. THAT'S NOT IT, AND WE FIND THAT THE RICHER IS SADDER, SADDER THAN MOST PEOPLE, THAT THE POOREST GIVE AWAY MORE OF THEIR DISPOSABLE... IF THAT'S EVEN A WORD... INCOME THAN THE RICH DO, SO SOMETHING IS OFF HERE, AND WHAT ACTUALLY JEFFERSON MEANT BY "HAPPINESS" AND WHAT THE FOUNDERS MEANT BY "HAPPINESS" WAS SORT OF LIFELONG LEARNING, AND THAT MEANS, AT THE ULTIMATE END OF THE DAY, YOU'RE ALWAYS SEEKING TO BE A BETTER PERSON, "TO BE A BETTER ANGEL," LINCOLN WOULD SAY, AND THAT'S HOW TO BE BETTER... "PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS," YOU KNOW, "A MORE PERFECT NATION." THIS IS NOTHING THAT YOU'VE SAID WE'VE ARRIVED AT, IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE TILTING TOWARDS, AND IF YOU'RE HEADING IN THAT DIRECTION, THINGS ARE USUALLY GOOD. IF YOU'RE NOT, THEN WE'RE WRINGING OUR HANDS AND SAYING, LIKE CHICKEN LITTLE, "OH, THE SKY IS FALLING." IT'S NOT, BUT WE DO HAVE TO BE HEADING FORWARD. YOU KNOW, WE DO HAVE TO BE GETTING BETTER. ♪ BURNS: THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SPOTS BECAUSE EVERYTHING YOU SEE IS VERMONT THAT ISN'T IN THE FOREGROUND TREE LINE. BURNS: WHEN I WAS MAKING "THE CIVIL WAR" SERIES, I WOULD GO OUT AND FILM WALPOLE FROM THIS VANTAGE. YOU CAN GO IN AND FIND, IN "THE CIVIL WAR" SERIES, WALPOLE IN ABOUT 5 OR 6 DIFFERENT PLACES. I THINK THAT OUR MEMORIES ARE, IN SOME WAYS, LITTLE FILM CLIPS, AND THEN SOMETIMES WE TELL ENOUGH STORIES AND THEY GET SORT OF SO ENDOWED THAT THEY DON'T BECOME... THEY'RE NOT THE ACTUAL PHOTOGRAPHIC OR FILM-CLIP MEMORIES, BUT THEY GET... THEY GET SORT OF... THEY GET TURNED INTO STORIES AND THEY GET PRACTICED, AND I'M AS SUSCEPTIBLE TO ANY OF THAT AS ANYBODY, BUT I ALSO REMEMBER STUFF. THERE WAS A GREAT MOMENT WHEN I TAUGHT MY BIG KIDS, WHEN THEY WERE LITTLE, BACK TO MY TOWN IN DELAWARE, WHERE I HAD GROWN UP AND PLAYED LITTLE LEAGUE, AND IN THE BACK OF MY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, WEST PARK PLACE ELEMENTARY, I WENT TO THE PLACE WHERE WE PLAYED BASEBALL, AND I PLAYED OUT... THEY SAT THERE WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN AS I PLAYED BACK OR I REENACTED LITTLE FILM CLIPS OF WHEN I MADE A SPECTACULAR, THROUGH-THE-LEGS PLAY, FOR THAT SHORTSTOP TO THE SECOND BASEMAN FOR A FORCE OUT, OR WHEN I MADE A DIVING CATCH IN RIGHT FIELD. AND THEY WERE JUST IN AMAZEMENT, AND I WAS AMAZED, TOO, THAT I COULD, IN MY ADULT LIFE, CATCH UP AND SORT OF REPLICATE AND SORT OF MOVE IN PARALLEL UNIVERSE WITH WHAT HAD HAPPENED WHEN I WAS 7 AND 8 AND 9. IT WAS THRILLING. ♪ I HAVE THESE MOMENTS WHERE I FEEL CONNECTED TO THE YOUNG ME. A LOT OF IT IS CONNECTED WITH THE TRAGEDY OF THE LOSS OF MY MOM. IN FACT, I MADE A FILM ABOUT A PAINTER NAMED WILLIAM SEGAL AND WHEN WE WERE... THE CAMERA WAS OFF, HE STARTED TALKING TO ME, AND HE STARTED SKETCHING ME WITHOUT LOOKING DOWN, AND I TALKED TO HIM AND I WAS MEETING HIS EYE, AND SUDDENLY HE LOOKED DOWN AND HE SAID, "OH, MY GOODNESS. I'VE PAINTED A CHILD." AND HE'D PAINTED ME AT AGE 8, AND I'VE KEPT THAT IN MY BEDROOM EVER SINCE. HE LOOKED AT ME, AND HE SAW EXACTLY WHERE I WAS BOTH ARRESTED, AND WHERE I... MEANING THE BOY THAT HOPED THAT THE TRAGEDY THAT WAS ABOUT TO OVERTAKE HIS FAMILY WOULDN'T HAPPEN, BUT HE'S STILL THERE, AND I REMEMBER, JUST SHORTLY AFTER MY 65th BIRTHDAY, AND I WAS GOING TO SEE MY OLDEST DAUGHTER AND MY SON-IN-LAW AND MY GRANDKIDS, AND I WAS BOUNDING UP THE SUBWAY STAIRS, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, I FELT THE 8-YEAR-OLD BOUNDING ALONG WITH ME, TOO. I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE I HAD A MEMORY OF BOUNDING UP STAIRS WITH A SIMILAR ABANDON, AND I THOUGHT, "YEAH, IT'S JUST... YOU KNOW, AGE IS JUST A NUMBER," AND THEN, OF COURSE, EVERYTHING STARTED FAILING. ♪ MAN: MY JOB WAS TO GET SHOT AT. MY JOB WAS DRAW ENEMY FIRE. I WAS A DUCK DECOY. I GOT SHOT AT A LOT. I ENGAGED THE ENEMY A LOT. ♪ MAN: UH, YOU FOUND IN MUSGRAVE THE IDEAL PERSON, I THINK, TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF SO MANY OF US AND OUR... HURT AND IN OUR... THAT... THERE'S A LINE HE SAYS NEAR THE END, "WHEN THE CHINOOKS CAME DOWN AND TOOK US AWAY, FOR WHAT?" AND I, IN MY TIME IN VIETNAM, I THOUGHT THAT EVERY DAY, VIRTUALLY. WE'D GO IN SOMEWHERE, AND SOMEONE MIGHT DIE, AND HELICOPTERS WOULD TAKE US AWAY AND WE'D THINK, "FOR WHAT?" YOU CAPTURED THAT THROUGH THAT VERY COMPELLING FACE OF HIS. SO EXPRESSIVE. IT'S NOT JUST WHAT HE SAYS. IT'S THE MOVEMENT OF HIS EYES, AND IT SHOWS WHAT FILM CAN DO THAT I'M NOT SURE CAN BE DONE JUST WITH AUDIO. IT'S A MIXTURE OF THAT GUY'S EYES, AS CARL SAID, LOOKING FOR "WHAT SHOULD I SAY?" ♪ BURNS: THERE IS A CERTAIN ARROGANCE TO PRESUME THAT WE SOMEHOW CONTROL OUR LIVES. WE CAN. WE CAN EXERT WILL AT PARTICULAR TIMES THAT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE, CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A MODESTLY TALENTED FILMMAKER COMPLETING A FILM AND SOMEBODY WHO MAYBE HAD MORE TALENT, BUT DIDN'T HAVE THE PERSEVERANCE, AND SO THE PERSEVERANCE WINS AND THE FILM IS MADE, THE PERSEVERANCE FAILS AND THE FILM DIDN'T GET MADE, AND WE NEVER GET TO KNOW THAT THAT WAS ANOTHER ORSON WELLES OR ANOTHER WHATEVER, SO WE CAN DO IT, BUT AT THE MOST PART, WE SORT OF FEEL THAT LARGER THINGS ARE HAPPENING, AND THAT'S WHERE HUMILITY HAS TO BE A HUGE PART OF WHO WE ARE. WE HAVE TO FEEL THE FACT THAT WE'RE JUST PART OF SOMETHING, AND THE FACT THAT NONE OF US GET OUT OF THIS ALIVE HAS GOT TO BE, YOU KNOW, HUMBLING. WE SPEND ALMOST ALL OF OUR LIVES TRYING TO AVOID THAT FACT, WHICH IS WHY I'M SO DRAWN TO ERNEST HEMINGWAY, A FILM I'M WORKING ON RIGHT NOW, IS 'CAUSE HE DIDN'T JUST COURT DEATH IN A PHYSICAL SENSE, BUT HE UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS WAS AS BIG A PART OF LIFE AS LIFE WAS, AND HE MOVED TOWARDS IT. [STRINGS PLAYING] ♪ BURNS, VOICE-OVER: THEY'RE WATCHING YOUR PROCESS, JUST GATHERING A PIECE OF MUSIC, SORT OF FUSSING WITH IT, PLAYING WITH IT, TALKING AMONG YOURSELVES OR FINDING IT, AND THEN LAYING IT DOWN; JUST IT FEELS SO SIMILAR, LIKE THERE'S A KINSHIP, YOU KNOW. ONE OF MY FAVORITE THING... IS THERE'S A KINSHIP. WOMAN: IT'S CREATIVE. WELL, LISTEN, YOU KNOW WHAT WE THINK OF YOU. HEH! WE KNOW WHAT WE THINK OF WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING FOR DECADES AND YOUR PROCESS OF DOING VERY, VERY LARGE TOPICS AND YOU GO REALLY DEEP INTO IT. REALLY DEEP. AND YOU REALLY FAN OUT AND YOU TRY AND TELL THE MULTI-PERSPECTIVE, YOU KNOW, STORY, AND FROM MANY, MANY SIDES AND... THAT IS MULTI-PERSPECTIVE, RIGHT? YES. HA HA HA! JUST WANTED TO CHECK ON THAT. YOU'RE GOOD. YOU'RE GOOD. HA HA! AND THAT'S HOW INCREDIBLY RARE THAT IS, AND WE'RE JUST KIND OF, "WOW, THANK GOD YOU EXIST." OH, WELL, IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU'RE ABLE TO EVEN DO AS DEEP A DIVE AS YOU'D WANT TO DO UNLESS YOU CAN BRING PEOPLE ALONG. AND THE VEHICLE FOR DOING THAT, THE FASTEST WAY TO A PERSON'S HEART, WHICH IS THE SOUL OF THIS, IS OPEN-HEART SURGERY, IS MUSIC. BURNS, VOICE-OVER: SO WE WERE IN CONSULTANT'S MEETINGS FOR "THE CIVIL WAR." WE HADN'T EVEN STARTED EDITING, BUT THE SCRIPTS WEREN'T DONE, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'D ENGAGED SCHOLARS AT THE BEGINNING, TWO DOZEN OF THEM, SOME PULITZER PRIZE WINNERS, REALLY AMAZING PEOPLE. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE OF THEM, VERY FEW HAD SENT FIRST-PERSON QUOTES, AND WE BEGGED THEM FOR FIRST-PERSON QUOTES SO WE COULD POPULATE IT NOT JUST WITH EXPOSITION, BUT WITH THE SOUND OF HOW PEOPLE SPOKE. AND ONE DAY WE GOT A LETTER, AND MY BROTHER CAME IN AND SAID, "THIS IS WHAT ROBERT JOHANSSON HAD SENT US." HE HANDED IT TO ME, AND I STARTED TO READ IT OUT LOUD IN MY OFFICE, SAME OFFICE I'M IN NOW, AND BY THE END OF IT, MY VOICE WAS CRACKING, AND EVERYONE ELSE WAS IN TEARS. I HANDED IT TO RICK, AND I SAID, "MAKE A COPY OF IT AND PUT IT AS THE LAST THING IN EPISODE ONE." HE GOES, "BUT IT'S THE BATTLE OF MANASSAS, WHICH IS ABOUT 20 MINUTES BEFORE THE END OF EPISODE ONE." AND I JUST SAID, "PUT IT AT THE END. IT'S WHAT THE WHOLE STAKES... IT'S WHAT THE WHOLE FILM IS ABOUT." AND, SO EVEN THOUGH WE'D PASSED THAT BATTLE, WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED, HERE'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. AND IT'S ABOUT LOVE, AGAIN. IT'S ABOUT LOVE OF COUNTRY, LOVE OF GOVERNMENT, LOVE OF CAUSE... STUFF YOU DON'T HEAR VERY MUCH TODAY... LOVE OF FAMILY, LOVE OF WIFE, LOVE OF PARTNER, LOVE OF CHILDREN, LOVE OF LOVE, LOVE OF GOD... ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE IN THE LETTER, AND I TOOK ONE OF THE COPIES AND PUT IT UP ON MY WALL, AND I TOOK ANOTHER ONE AND FOLDED IT UP AND PUT IT IN MY WALLET. AND FOR MANY YEARS AFTER "THE CIVIL WAR," I CARRIED IT AROUND AND WOULD READ IT PERIODICALLY AND, YOU KNOW, "SARAH, MY LOVE FOR YOU IS DEATHLESS. "IT SEEMS TO BIND ME LIKE MIGHTY CABLES THAT NOTHING "BUT OMNIPOTENCE CAN HOLD, AND YET MY LOVE OF COUNTRY "COMES OVER ME LIKE A STRONG WIND AND BEARS ME IRRESISTIBLY TO THE BATTLEFIELD." YOU KNOW, I MEAN, IT'S JUST... IT'S AMAZING. IT'S JUST AN AMAZING LETTER ABOUT LOVE, AND I THINK EVERY, YOU KNOW, MAN WISHES HE COULD SAY THESE THINGS TO THE WOMAN HE LOVES, OR, MORE IMPORTANTLY, EVERY WOMAN WISHES HER MAN COULD SAY THESE THINGS TO HER. AND SO IT WAS A PERFECT THING. IT FELL APART IN MY POCKET. I USED TO BE ABLE TO PUT IT UP INTO 8 OR 10 LITTLE PIECES, AND THEN FINALLY I JUST RETIRED IT. AND IT'S FUNNY, I END UP NOT MEMORIZING, BUT I END UP REMEMBERING LOTS OF QUOTES IN THE COURSE OF WORKING ON A FILM: YOU KNOW, "BASEBALL," THE OPENING NARRATION; THIS QUOTE FROM WALT WHITMAN; THIS QUOTE FROM ABRAHAM LINCOLN, AND I NEVER FELT COMPELLED TO COMMIT IT TO MEMORY. IT'S JUST GOING TO BE ORGANIC, WHAT GETS COMMITTED TO MEMORY, AND FOR WHATEVER REASON, THAT'S NOT ON THE HARD DRIVE, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY IN MY HEART. DUNCAN: WE LEAVE HERE TO GO SOMEPLACE, BUT IT ALWAYS BRINGS US BACK TO WALPOLE BECAUSE IT'S HOME, AND IT'S BECAUSE IT'S WHERE WE DO THE WORK THAT WE DO, AND WE ARE LUCKY. MAN: CHORUS.
