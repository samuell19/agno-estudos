So instead, the Piper led all the kids down to the river, and drowned them, just like the rats. That's what happens when you don't pay the Piper. - Uh actually, I think the kids got away. - Oh, I thought they all drowned. Nah the kids always get away. Kids. Ice cream man?

Mom! - Oh oh excuse me, what do you think of this color.

Where's the fatty? - It's okay little fella, I'm not gonna hurt you. - What on earth do you suppose he was running from?

Chris what happened. Oh honey I'm here. Don't worry now come on tell me what happened. Chris, unless you tell me what happened, mommy can't help you. He said he'd kill you if I told. What, who said that? The ice cream man. He killed small Paul last night. Oh my god, oh honey. Nice to see you again officers. - You Gregory tudor? - Yes, yes I am. Give him the warrant. Can I keep this? - You got any large dogs, ice cream man? No. Why the search officers? - I want you go through everything, you find any hollowed doors or floors, bust 'em open, you got it? Yes sir. - Hell I remember getting ice cream here when I was a kid. Who was the guy who owned it? Brickle, butch brickle. Oh yeah the ice cream king. It's nice to see somebody's opening the place up again. Well sounds like we're missing out on all the fun. Oh, that, that, hey, hey! Could you search a little, uh, more careful please. More careful? Hey uhm... This is a collectable. - Jesus, hate to get my hand caught in that. I use it to chop nuts. Did you find, did you find anything? - There's nothing down here sir. - Do you realize how long it takes to make butter brickle? - Well ice cream man, we're sorry, we didn't find anything. - Are you sorry you didn't find anything and wrecked my place, or are you just sorry you didn't find anything. - You boys have the wrong house, I'm the one with the missing dog. - Whoa, hold it, hold it. - Where were you last night around six? - He was here, working to pay his rent. Why are you bothering this poor boy. I'm the one with the missing dog. Who are you? - I'm nurse wharton, Gregory's landlord, neighbor and guardian, serve and protect my ass. - You have to understand, the people get pretty uptight when there's a missing child involved. But I'm the ice cream man. I make children happy. Today you ruined the happiness of those children for many days to come. Do you understand the consequences? - You know I never thought about it like that. Yeah I bet you didn't. - You call this number tomorrow, tell 'em what happened. I'm sure that the city is gonna help you. What about my dog? - You know, those daisies are magnificent, how do you do that? - Actually I chop up policemen and use 'em as fertilizer, they make great fertilizer. - You know, there's something weird going on here. Get some background on that guy. You got a hunch? - I might, let's put a tail on him anyway. - You know, I'm sure your dog is around here somewhere. - That's very sweet of you Gregory, you have a happy day. - Remember, no bad days Gregory, only happy, happy happy days! - Oh no, don't don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you. What do you think little boy? Are you having a bad day? Yeah, you're right. Not every day is a happy happy happy day. Ice cream professor? Butter brickle. He's gotta keep quiet. - Suffer little children, Jesus, so wisely admonished his disciples on the coasts of judea, suffer not to come onto thee, for of such is the kingdom of heaven. Always remember that neither death nor power, nor hate, nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which eternally rests in Christ, Jesus, our lord and savior. Let us pray. - I told the police everything, they'll get him. - Yeah but I'm still grounded for a month. - Hey don't worry, there might be an opening in the rocketeers. - Hey guys, let's go. Small Paul's dead. - No one else seems to think anything's wrong. - But how could they let him go? - All I know, is I'm not letting him get us. All the grown-ups worry about their stupid problems. - What we need to do, is catch him on film. - Since when do kids go trailing murderers? We're just kids we'll get killed, just like small Paul. - Look tuna, I know you've been through a lot more than we have but we gotta do something. - Why why is it up to us, why can't we just stay in our backyards and just keep away from him. - Because we're the rocketeers and we stick together. - We're doing this. - The three of us. - We'll need a camera, we can take a picture of him and give it to the police. Hang on I think I can get one. - That was a bird? - I can't do bird calls. But you said you could! But I don't wanna look stupid. - I got news for you. - Shut up! - Ssshht, I can hear you guys all the way in the backyard, let's go! Okay guys it's 11:45, we've been out for 35 minutes. Let's take a break. - You know, maybe the ice cream man thinks he's the pied Piper. Huh? - Well he drives around in his truck playing the music, and all the kids come running. But then if he catches one of them alone- - yeah well uhm, let's not talk about right now. Get down! Let's go. Come on tuna! Tuna, come on! - Where the hell is he going? - Ssshh! Small Paul! I wanna go back, I wanna go back! What's he doing to small Paul? - I don't know, i can't tell, what is it? It's... It's ice cream. - I'm fixing up a little party for you. Yeah you're gonna like this one. Looks like you got a lot of friends. I didn't know how much ice cream to bring, you can pass it out later. I'm doing really good. Yeah, they love ice cream. It's gonna be a good summer. Hey would you mind your business, I'm talking to somebody. You guys having a party? You having a happy, happy day? It sure is getting noisy around here. Butch brickle, ice cream king. - Let's go. - Okay. 149. - I lost track of tuna, we'd better get back. You go. - What? - I'll be fine. Just gimme your bike so I can have a rocket. I don't think so. Don't worry, I'm a rocketeer. Just make sure tuna didn't fall or something. Meet me back here, all right, and hurry. Tuna you okay? No! What's wrong? - My sides are killing me and I feel like I wanna puke. Hey where's Heather? - I left her back at the ice cream truck. Small Paul? Holy shit, the kid's got a gun! This isn't a game boys, there's a child stalker out there and you two are playing cops and robbers. - But what about Heather she's gonna die, the ice cream man's got her! - I've already called it in, there's someone already on the way to her house. Her house, she's not at her house! Hey! You guys wanna end up on the milk carton? - I'm sorry to disturb you reverend Langley, but we had a report that your daughter Heather was missing. - No she's tucked away in bed, has been all night. What's the matter Charles? - I hate to do this sir, but could you please check on her? She's sleeping like a baby. Come to church on Sunday Charles, I'm giving a sermon on trust. Damn! - The Langley girl is fine, sleeping like a baby. 10-4. Look boys, enough of these stories. But- - first the ice cream man kills the weatherly boy, and now the Langley girl? I mean we've had it up to here. - When do you want 'em? - It says one hour. - You could get hard duplicates, or you could our eight hour service for, 10, it depends on how many exposures come out. I need those immediately. Four by six oversize, is? 14 bucks, three by five regular? How soon? One hour. 14 bucks, one day, 12. Back in an hour. The ice cream man is like the pied Piper, only evil. What? - You know he drives around in this truck, temping all the kids, and they follow him. And slowly he gets rids of them, like rats. Hah, another! - Lovely, we only need 10 dollars worth of quarters, then we can pick up the film. I think we got it! - Oh yeah! - Johnny! What the hell are you doing with my camera? Where's the film? I'll start with you? Where's the film? - Oh here. - Let's go, come on i got it, let's go! - Hey, get that hunk ofjunk outta here. Hey, hey ice cream man! Come on let's go, I'm in a hurry here. Go, come on this isn't a parking lot. Hey, ice cream man! This is not a hunk ofjunk! Well hello. If I had known this was delivery day, why that stand in would've never made it through the door. I brought you something special. Oh, sounds yummy. You know, we should swap recipes, creamsicle for custard pie. - Well I check out ice cream man, couldn't find squat. But that weird lady with the dog. I remember she was just as flipped as he was. - You're talking about the nurse. Yeah nurse wharton. I called and checked on her nursing license, she had a career from 1950 to 1993. Spent the last 20 at some private clinic called wishing well, for the mentally disturbed. - I can't believe those little perverts, what the hell were they doing developing my pictures. Oh my god! I'm gonna kill those bastards. - You know, this is the whole secret to making ice cream. It's this kinda secret ingredient I put in it. Here come on let's go put it in. You gotta just dump a little bit of this stuff in. Makes it sweet, see, you gotta just put a little bit in, it's the, special amount you put in. Now, the trick is, is stirring it in just right. Would you like to stir? Yeah. All right, here you go. Oh now watch your hand, that blade, that blade will take your hand right off. There you go. Cool! - Do you really think your brother's gonna pick up those pictures without looking at them? I don't know, he's stupid enough. - Well what happens if he's not? Geez what are you, stupid? - Did you see the truck? - No. I gotta get home. If my mom finds out i snuck out again- we'll ride with you. - I'll be fine. - We're riding with you. - Yeah, things aren't the same as they used to be around here, more patients have died, and some pockets dried up. Hmm, of course when you die, you'll dry up. Why all the plastic flowers? Because real ones die. We want happy patients. So do you do shock therapy lobotomy, like that cuckoo movie? - Oh, we believe in keeping our patients happy. We believe in compassion. Help me! Shut up! You remember a nurse wharton? Do I, oh oh oh! Hell everybody did! - What was it that everybody liked so much about nurse wharton? - She gave everybody ice cream, when the pain and the loneliness came, she cared for the patient. Gregory was her favorite. Greqoty? Gregory tudor? Oh god, do something! Anthony's getting out of hand. I must ask you two to leave. This is not a happy day. Oh my god. Remember, only happy days. A bad day gentlemen, a very bad day! Ha ha ha, come out come out wherever you are, come out come out wherever you are, come out come out wherever you are. Only happy days.

Call the- you're the guys who cried wolf. Look, besides we don't have any evidence, and obviously either do the police, or they would have him by now, so, this is my chance to mess him up. Come on, we gotta do something. - Cut the lone ranger shit, you're not a police officer. - Janet, I got the gun, the badge will follow. - Oh no. - Listen. You guys, you're gonna get in the car all right, anything goes wrong, all you have to do is call in the radio, you call in for backup all right. - Hurry! - All right. - Look I think we should just call the police. - No look let's just go help the fat kid while there's still time, get in the car, please I need you to look after these two. - There's still no sign of Charlie or Gus? No word. - Well get some backup over at the ice cream parlor. And keep trying to reach those officers. Who is he? The king. - Yes. - He's like the pied Piper. Chases away all the bad, and leaves a world of good. ' Yes! - Now it's illegal to use this channel unless you're pd, so nobody calls in unless it's an emergency, okay? Now this is serious. I want you all to stay in the car no matter what, you hear shots or screams or anything funny, you press the button, you radio it in, and then you hit my alarm okay? It sounds like a police siren. Be careful. - Sounds like we got a customer, come on! I'll be right back. - What's he doing? - I don't know. But he'd better get the hell outta there soon! Come on Jacob. Hiya honey! Now that's what I call a brain freeze. Creamsicle? This is gonna be fun. Come on! Come on! Wait!
