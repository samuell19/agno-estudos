You're always in a dangerous position I don't have the courage Witness my place I didn't want to take up arms This is not my story Even if you report all these horrors You feel useless How are you saying this? People need to know the truth The effect that truth has on people People care less about the truth This is a remote flick And the oppressors are still going strong People buy promises dreams They try it all the way To avoid seeing this awful thing Doesn't mean that the truth is not worth the search As smart as it may be Now I'll do it for myself And the people who follow me Because this is the right feeling Because that's enough Because you inspire me That's my direction This is what moves me The people you love don't make you move?

What? Silence The spring commander closed his eyes Focused on the dark Silent May Muffle A red scarf with pink flowers on her hair Despite himself Despite everything It looked like a queen from the past It's almost frozen outside The clouds are endlessly embracing the trees And they dance with the mountains And they play with the land of love It is so beautiful that it can erase the ugliness we saw And these women are still alive Standing In The Wind Standing in front of everything What they went through was unassailable In one night One Lonely Night More than 7,000 women were captured And used as sex slaves And when I say women I am in denial unbearable They were also children Exactly, they were baby girls Helpless beings whose identities were suddenly destroyed Raped Sold They were tortured More than half returned in the following months By escaping or being redeemed And some of them He even found the courage of war The warrior women began to read Our bodies and our blood feed the earth Baby our baby Our milk will be red It will be spring at the time of our death We believe A new day begins This will be a new era Women, Life, Freedom Women, Life, Freedom I saw many wars I saw many warriors But I was never a member of a women's organization And I found myself Shake from head to toe Returning to fragility I thought I'd lost it a long time ago You think you saw everything You think you're tough You think you're tired And suddenly do you remember Why did you choose this profession? The power of those who are alive fills you suddenly With an absolute vital force Spring asked me to write the truth after we separated The thing that stays in my mind There are women who were hunted Those who raise their heads and grow If each one falls, the other one will stand up For me, Matilda H. War Reporter I trembled at the sound of their words Perform a song A powerful song An old song A song that encourages us to get up Hope that goes against the human condition
