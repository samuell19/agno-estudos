[starts engine] [panting] [sobbing] Hey, what's happened? Oh, my God. Stay calm. Hello? Hey, you, come here. -Tamar. What's going on? -Do you know her? She's my girlfriend. What happened?I don't know. Stay with her. Tamar. Tamar, baby. Sara Stein, Murder Squad 3. I need an ambulance at the parking lot on Obentrautstrasße and Mehringdamm. Tamar, what happened?Tamar who? Tamar Levi. We work at the club. Flix, Flix, I'm so sorry. Flix? What does she mean? I don't know. Tamar. Flix.Tamar. Tamar. [Tamar] Flix, Flix. Tamar. Tamar. Fuck off. Fuck off. I'm here. Can you hear me? -Okay, this way. -Tamar. Please! Why was your girlfriend in the car park? We were on our break.And where were you? Somewhere. Does she have any family that should be informed? She's from Israel. Her sister is here. Phone her and tell her to come to the hospital. Anne, have the car examined and search the area for the weapon. Okay, Max is outside taking the details of all the clubbers. And then there's a sister too. Do you think it was robbery?It could have been anything. Listen, are you still at the club? Sara, are you still there?Yes. There are no security cameras, just a deejay camera. I've got the memory card. Flix? Yes, yes. Flix, I'll ask around. [sobbing] She was always so rebellious, so wild. My parents wanted nothing more to do with her. But I couldn't simply give up on her, could I? I had to return her to her faith. And how did your sister respond to that? Khalid is responsible for this. She shouldn't have got involved with someone like that. It wouldn't surprise me if he killed her. He stabs your sister and then comes here to wait for her to die? So that people will think he's innocent. That's how they always do it. [Sara] Who is "they"? The Palestinians. [sobbing] What a country full of dimwits. [machine beeps][man] You're never at home. Or are you already asleep? Don't forget the radio recording tomorrow. Since you won tickets, it's all he talks about. Your father is looking forward to it so much, unbelievable. Morning.[man] Morning. Hello.[man 2] Morning. [Sara] Have a nice day. [chattering] Alkan, can I have another cup of tea? Sure. Can you at least tell me something about the murder weapon? Yes, all right. I'll see you later. Come inside. Thanks. Sit down. I'm not finished yet. Do you want anything?No, thanks. Did you find anything last night? We can't find the murder weapon. It's missing. They found some grass, pills, a small dent on her car bumper. That's it. Her cell phone is missing too.Who is "they"? I told you, I hate working out on the street. I hate colds but I still have one sometimes. I said I'd swap with Max until you two work things out. That won't happen. I'm not standing out in the cold and the stench and the rain. All right. Were you there when she died? Yes. Come on, drive. We haven't identified half of them. They had all left. We'll have to use face recognition to ID them one by one. I'm happy to do that. [Sara] At what time was that? Hang on a sec. No. -Come on! -Come on! There you go, 01:53. Thank you. [Sara] The cause of death was the stab wound in the abdomen, internal bleeding. She was stabbed numerous times in the chest too. The weapon used was a switchblade. Look, a rather conspicuous tattoo. Do you think so?Yes, I do. Good morning.Madam Commissioner. What have we got? The victim is a 27-year-old deejay, Tamar Levi. An Israeli.Yes. She was stabbed in the car park of the club she worked. Multiple stabbings. Clearly homicide. Her sister, Ronit Levi is visiting here from Israel. Her boyfriend is Khalid Rahman, a Palestinian.Oh, Christ. It could have been robbery. I think it's a crime of passion. The victim's bag and money was in the club, but her phone is missing. Her car was broken into. The window was smashed but nothing seems to be missing. [commissioner] Murderer? So if it was her boyfriend, why would he write "murderer" on the car? I mean, the motive could be political. The Middle-East conflict. Some people think you're a murderer if you eat eggs. Yes, vegans, for instance. Anyway, I asked around a bit last night and it seems she was quite well-known in the scene. And known as a slut. She probably screwed around a lot. Yes. Apparently, her boyfriend was very jealous. They were always fighting. Enough. There are already photos on the Internet and a video of her being put into the ambulance. Not to mention conspiracy theories, Palestinians, Israelis, etc. -That was to be expected. -Yes, it was. You're Jewish too, aren't you, Sara? Yes, so? You think I can't be objective? Well, a dead Israeli, a Palestinian boyfriend... You know me, Ms. Schubert. You should be happy. Yes, you're right. All right, get on with it. Thanks. Are you Jewish? I didn't know. You're full of surprises, eh, Sara? Yes. And you're not.Yes. What? -Come on, Anne. We've got to go. -What about me? Man!Ouch. [man] You look gorgeous. [Tamar, laughing] Do you think so? Look at me. [Tamar] Hey. Take a sip of coffee. Come over here. Come into bed. Whom are you here to see?Khalid Rahman. Hello. Hi.Hello. Hello. Khalid, you have visitors. Hello, Mr. Rahman. How are you? [groans] So, Tamar was in the car park last night. Where were you?Smoking by the canal. And no... nobody saw me. The word "murderer" was written on her car. Tamar was never worried about that kind of thing. Do you have any idea who did it? Neo-Nazis, maybe? Lots of people hate Israelis. Palestinians, for instance. Listen, that was never an issue between me and Tamar. The two of you fought a lot. Who said that? Tamar's sister. Oh, yes, of course. What do you mean? Were you fighting or not? This is what they always do. When one of them dies, it's always us who did it. You don't have an alibi, Mr. Rahman. I loved her, damn it. Mom. Khalid, your father and I... we're always there for you. How do you know? It's-- it was in the newspaper. This is a policewoman, Mom. My mother. Hello. It wasn't him. It was the woman's own fault. Mr. Rahman, do me a favor, don't leave Berlin. -See you. -Good-bye. Ms. Stein, we have to get Tamar to Alon Moreh immediately. Ms. Levi, this is my colleague, Anne Rodeck. -Hello. -Alon Moreh? Our settlement. We have to bury her tomorrow. Our religion commands it. It's not going to happen. The investigation, you see. It would be the same in Israel. If only she hadn't come here. She turned her back on hashem. I'm sorry. Good-bye. It means "God." I know that. Anne, you have to ask questions sometimes too. You're no use to me if you just stand timidly in the corner. I told you...Oh, cut the crap. You're a cop. [sighs] She's our misfortune. Why did you do it? What? What are you talking about? He saw you. Who saw what? Your father. He saw the two of you leaving the club together. What? He was there? He was at the club? Because of the money. Leave. Get out! Please.I told you to leave! [panting] [Sara] Where's Anne? [Max] At the DA with Schubert about an account inquiry. She's really scared out there. Her work performance is suffering. Model in Paris.And so is mine. You always were good at that. -What? -Fawning. So that you get what you want. Rosilein is much more suitable to you. Do I hear a tiny bit of regret in your voice? Max, please, stop it. You should try it too. Getting married is a really extreme experience. See you, Norbert.Bye. Man, I'm late. Watch that till the end, will you? -But I want to go home too. -Well, Rosi will have to wait. Bye. Bye. [tenor singing aria in German] [whispering] [no audible dialogue] Isn't he wonderful? [singing continues] [woman] For Johanna. It was wonderful. Thank you. Thank you.Thank you. For Leo Stein. I'm so happy. My daughter won the tickets for the recording today. Thank you, Mr. Shapiro, for your courage. Thank you for the wonderful interruption. I've never heard "Winter Journey" played so evocatively. It's how Schubert intended it. You enjoyed it too, didn't you? Do you always turn up late? I hope I didn't distract you. Oh, I quite like being distracted sometimes. I don't have your rendition of "Brahms' Second Piano Concerto," unfortunately. But I do love it. Is it available? Not at the moment but if you like, I can have it sent to you. That's very kind of you. Sara, would you give him your card? Yes, here. Chief Inspector Sara Stein. -Should I be worried? -Not if you're innocent. Leo Stein, my wife Helen, my daughter Sara. We really enjoyed it. I enjoyed it too.It was wonderful. Good-bye.Good-bye. Sarale? Yes. Shalom. Sara, are you coming? [speaking in Hebrew] [chuckling] [female reporter] The celebrated pianist, David Shapiro, is leading an Israeli-Palestinian children's orchestra in Tel Aviv. We'll be hearing much more from him in future. Hello.Morning. [sobbing] [Anne] So, the Rahman family. No convictions, they run a café, and it seems they're in financial trouble. Tamar came here a year ago, opened an account, and deposited 10,000 euros. Three days later, 8,000. She didn't touch the 18,000 euros until six weeks ago. She transferred it to Khalid, and she immediately-- And he paid it to his father, Tarik Rahman. Yeah, and that, while witnesses say that he didn't want to see his son anymore. Ms. Stein, Ms. Rodeck. [sniffles] According to the press office, a news magazine is publishing a story about Tamar Levi's time in the Israeli army. I don't think this is political. I very much hope that your estimation is right. [phone ringing] Schubert. Yes, of course I'll keep you informed. Yes. We've got to solve this. Rodeck has found transactions between the victim and Khalid's father. -Drugs? -Or weapons, terrorism, laundering. Yes, well... [cell phone ringing] What is it now? Look, this is a very inconvenient time. Besides, you already said everything, didn't you? [Anne] I'm not going in there. It's your job to go in. No, I have a desk job. I can't help you here. Max would be of help to you. You're so stubborn. That's not true. [knocking] My son isn't a murderer. I'm not saying he is. I just want to know if you knew her. No, I never met her. What did you think of your son's relationship with an Israeli? It was never a problem for me. There were no arguments about it? Khalid said you didn't want to see him anymore. Ms. Stein, don't I have the right to learn? Of course, we weren't very happy to begin with. Look, 30 years ago we were refugees. And we're grateful. We've assimilated ourselves. And you never met Ms. Levi? No. How is it possible that her money was transferred into your bank account? That was Khalid's money. No, it wasn't. I can hardly believe that. And if it's true, then my son was clever enough to take an Israeli for her money. And that's great. I mean, it's not a crime, is it? What did you need the money for, Mr. Rahman? We had a bad year, Ms.-- -Stein. -Ms. Stein. Khalid helped us out. Feel free to look into our books. Are you hungry too? He's lying. He was well-prepared, he's hiding something. From out here, their body language was very tense. No, really? Maybe he was protecting his son.Maybe. Maybe it's all very simple. At the club, they said that Tamar had affairs with other men. Maybe Khalid attacked her. Because all Arabs are like that?Just a theory. We've got to check the factory. Come on. [door opens, closes] Hey! Come back here! Police! No. [sighs] [cocks gun] [machine humming] Sara? [machine humming continues] Sara? Sara? [grunting, faint] Damn it. Great. This is really great. I'm sorry. You blink and already it's over. I told you, I belong behind a desk. One more word and you're out on the street forever. I saw that guy at the club.Are you sure? Check the video if you don't believe me. No, it's okay. Here, thanks a lot. We're going upstairs. At least wipe the dirt off your face. Thanks. [woman singing] ♪ Our feet will walk The extra miles♪ ♪ That's the cost Of loving me♪ ♪ I try and try And focus on it♪ Are you feeling better?Yes. There's a kind of ceremony in remembrance of Tamar. Really? And Khalid? We could question him tomorrow.Hang on, and the sister? Blessed are you, Lord, our God, King of the universe, who has commanded us to light the Shabbat candle. May it be Your will, my God and God of my forefathers, my husband, my sons-- Hello. That You show favor to me in the merit of Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel and Leah, our mothers. Let our light and Your countenance shine so that we are saved. Amen. Ms. Levi, the man with red hair and a kippah, was he visiting you? No, I don't know anybody here. Why don't you arrest Khalid? Do you have proof? Did you see anything? Ronit, what did he do to your sister? Tamar was pregnant... but she didn't want to keep the baby. She had an abortion. Pregnant by Khalid? When was the abortion? Two days before she-- And Khalid was against the abortion? He acts as if he's not a Muslim, but he is a Muslim. How could Pathology miss that? I put them under a lot of pressure. They had very little time. So we have a motive and Khalid has disappeared. I'll put out a search. You and your searches. It all costs tax money, Anne. Better once too often than not often enough. [Anne] I can hear the choirboys sing "Better Once too Often." I'm cold. [Sara] Are you all right? Are you not feeling well? They're having a party up there... and Tamar is dead. She was my best friend. It makes me feel sick. I'm Sara, I'm with the police. This is my colleague, Anne.Hello. -I'm taking you home. -I don't want to go home. Yes, you're going home. Come on. I don't-- What's your name? Jenny Petzold. And how old are you? Seventeen. [yells] [music plays] [volume increases] Really, you mustn't do this. Hello? Would you get out of here, please? I can't stand cops! Get out of here! Who can stand them?

I'm afraid♪ [music stops] Look, I don't have all day. How do you know Tamar and what can you tell me about her? I knew her from the club. And you were a fan of hers? No, her music wasn't really my taste but she was still a star. And that star was your best friend? Okay, I exaggerated a little but I sing too. Spend much time at the factory? No, not really. So you don't know what went on between Khalid and Tamar? Khalid is an asshole. They were always fighting because he's jealous because she had many more fans than he did. You see? If you see or hear anything strange, come straight to me, all right? Here's my card. Hey, I'm not a police informer. Oh, sorry. Where's your dog? It's not mine. It belonged to the girl who lived here before me. Hello, Anne. So, how's the detective work going? Yes. No, you don't need to pick me up. [Sara] Yes. [dogs barking] Yes, I'll come back to the station. Okay? Bye. You were right. Where did you find it? I see. Yes, that's what I was saying. Ms. Schubert told me to tell you there's a press conference tomorrow and she wants you to be there. I'm saying nothing. What?She's saying nothing. What do you mean? I'm not saying anything. What now? You want me to tell that to Schubert? Look where she's going. Ms. Schubert... We don't have enough to call a press conference. And I think we've got plenty, judging by this interim report. It seems you're right about a crime of passion. But it's not certain, and we have a new suspect too. We don't know his identity yet. He might be an Israeli. Well, jealousy, an abortion-- Khalid Rahman doesn't have an alibi-- By the way, there will be consequences for Pathology missing the abortion. It was my fault. Whatever. It shouldn't happen. Look, we've got enough to justify ruling out a political motive. That should calm everybody down a bit. I don't want to hear it.Sara... It's your job. You can do what you like in your department. Even with married men. I won't get involved. You will attend the press conference. -All right. -It's not all right. I'm sorry, Sara. After 12 years of marriage, I'm suddenly all alone. [knocking] Excuse me, Ms. Schubert. Sara, there's someone here from Israel... a Mr. Shapiro. [door closes] I'm really sorry for you. Go on, off you go. [sighs] What's this all about? What are you doing here? I've got the CD for your father. Brahms. Yes, but-- And I want to plead guilty. What is your crime, Mr. Shapiro? David. David. Do you believe in love at first sight? I'd need proof. I'll provide proof if you have dinner with me. Okay. What? Okay? Just like that? Yes, okay. I'll be right back. I just need to get my things. [sighs, giggles] [sniffles] I love you. [laughing] [knocking] I love you so much. Khalid, dinner is served. [door closes] I'm so happy. [sniffles] Anything can happen, you know? [giggles] You said something typical of Berlin. Well... Enjoy.Thank you. Thank you. -Bon appétit. -You too. [both laughing] This is about as typical of Berlin as it gets. -Good? -Mm-hmm. Alkan, can I have some pul biber? Sure. Want some? It's lovely.Sure. [both laughing] Thank you. Here you are. Were you born here? Born and bred in Berlin. Are you a member of the congregation? No, that's not my thing. It's not your thing. My grandfather was a communist and my mother is a gym teacher. Fantastic logic. I'm just not much of a Jew. I'm sorry, I hope you don't mind. Pay attention, here comes the proof. Hey, Mahmut, look. -Hey, Sara, what's-- -Hey, who's that? Hey, guys, that's enough. -Is there a problem? -No, it's fine. Well, well, well, you weren't expecting that, eh? Whew! You seem to have things under control. Yes. Yes. What have you seen of Berlin? Not much yet. Maybe you can make me a list of the things you like to do. I already have an idea. Yes? I live just over there. [moans] [moaning] [panting] That's her... my dead Israeli. What now? You tell me. The artist and the policewoman. You think I can't be hard as nails? Yes. -Yes? -Yes. Conduct Bruckner's Ninth, then you'll know what pain is. You poor man. [laughing] [Mrs. Rahman] He saw you. [Mrs. Rahman] He saw the two of you leave the club together. The police are looking for you. What did you tell them? Nothing. They don't even know who you are. Fly home, forget Tamar. Just fly home. Leave me alone. I'll see you in Alon Moreh. Berlin is a world city and world cities echo the world's crises. We realize that there could be a political aspect to this case -but I must emphasize-- -She's doing well. ...that as things stand, everything points in a different direction. I will now hand over to Chief Inspector Sara Stein. I have nothing to add. Just a moment. I'm afraid I have nothing to say while the investigation is ongoing. Christ, Sara. I'm sick of the conspiracy theories. It's all speculation. That's the way it is. But we made our point very clearly. Or rather, I did. You were being your usual uncooperative self. Whomever we convict, someone is going to be unhappy about it. It can't be an Arab, certainly not a German. An Israeli might be okay. How about a Martian? Would that be politically correct enough? [snickering]Sorry. Are you sure you want to make this statement? Nobody can force you to incriminate your family. Tarik Rahman, you're suspected of murder.[woman] Come with us. What is the meaning of this? You're hurting me! [Sara] November 13th, 11:45. Persons present at the recording of this statement: Commissioner Vera Schubert, Chief Inspector Sara Stein, and the witness making the statement, Khalid Rahman. Go ahead. He did it. My father. He killed her. Does this shirt belong to your husband? My father, Tarik Rahman... killed my girlfriend, Tamar Levi. Would you like something to drink too? I can remain silent too. We can both remain silent until the cows come home. The results of the tests on the stains of your shirt show them to be bloodstains. The DNA in the blood is being compared to Tamar Levi's DNA as we speak. Do you have anything to say now? Do you understand the gravity of your situation? Mr. Rahman, I'm charging you with the murder of Tamar Levi. I won't say a word, not a single word. Hannes? -You have the right to an attorney. -I don't need an attorney. Mr. Rahman, stand up, please. [handcuffs open] [Anne] All right, we'll wait. Thank you. The phone records will take a while. -Have we got the murderer? -Yes, it looks like it. Yes, it looks like it. It's too good to be true. The victim's phone, the bloodstained shirt... Have we identified that guy wearing the kippah yet? -No, not yet. Or have we? -No. -No. -Come on, let's talk to Khalid. Yes. Max? -Yep. -[sighs] [water sloshing] [door opens] -Some water? -[door shuts] Your statement seems to check out, but I'm unsure about a number of details. Your mother, did she know Tamar? No. But Tamar agreed? -Agreed to what? -Lending your father 18,000 euros. Yes, she did. Is there an IOU? We don't need things like that. Family. Mm. [laughing] Family... The rules change quickly in your family. First he didn't want to see you, then you lent him money and Tamar agreed. To top it all, it was Jewish money. You will never understand. [door opens, closes] You want me to do it?Yes. Test us. We understand a lot. The only person who was mad about the money was Ronit. So she knew about it? She came here and started interfering in our lives. Tamar was pregnant by you. And she had an abortion. Did Ronit tell you that? She told you to fuck off, why? Yes. Why? [tapping] Mrs. Rahman, don't you think it's strange that we found Tamar Levi's phone and a bloodstained shirt here? You said your husband was at home on the night of the murder. Yes. Allah sees everything and only He judges. It's the same for you lot. "Us lot"? In your religion. It said in the newspaper that you're Jewish. Well, if it's in the newspaper... Something has happened in your family. I'm not talking about your son being with an Israeli but about her carrying his baby and having an abortion. You knew, didn't you? She killed my grandchild. [Anne] Max, it's getting cold. I'm starting. Ah. Bon appétit. -Enjoy. -Can't I just have meatballs? We don't serve meatballs. You potato head.Hey, I heard that. He's an asshole. I phoned Sara, she's on her way. Good. -Ah, and here she is. -Hello. -Hi. -Hi. Hello. -Hi, Anne. -Hello. Well? Mrs. Rahman is withholding a lot, but she said she knew about the abortion. The phone records are in. Tarik and Tamar spoke on the phone twice. We know from their voice mails they met a week before she died. [Max] Can I have a glass too? They probably had things to discuss. Debts, abortion... We've found the gynecologist. I'm going to see him tomorrow. And three text messages from an Avi. He writes that he wants her back and that he'll do anything for her. If it's the guy with the kippah, then Ronit lied and probably does know him. What about the photographs? I sent them to Tel Aviv but I don't know how long it'll take. [Max] Well, look who's getting out of that taxi. [sighs] I'll be right back. I'm sorry, I forgot. Mm-hmm. I'm not in the mood for a candlelit dinner. -You'd rather sit in a kebab house. -It's my job. Who's that guy you're with? He's my colleague. I just wanted to see you again. I'm leaving tomorrow. [panting] [cell phone rings] [ringing] Hello, David. I'm sorry that we had to say farewell like that. Yes, so am I. [door phone rings] Just a moment, there's someone at the door. [clears throat] Hello? -[knocking] -He-- Just a moment. I decided to be mature for once in my life. That's good. [both chuckle] [soft ballad plays] Hello. Tell me something.Hmm? Have you heard of the kibbutz, or kind of kibbutz, Alon Moreh? No, I don't think so. Why? My case. I need to learn more about a Levi family that lives there. Can you help me? Come with me. Hmm? We'll fly away together. Mm. [giggles]Hmm? Mm.Hmm? [laughing] Ow! [laughing] Ow! Ow! We could have an argument, a huge fight so that we can decide that it won't work out. Okay, let's have a fight. [growls] Hey, Khalid. I'm so sorry. Thank you. [woman singing] ♪ You're one of a kind♪ ♪ So why shouldn't I Be with you?♪ ♪ Looking up, I find♪ Morning.Morning. Oh...She sent it to Tamar. ♪ Are you my truest friend?♪ Poor Jenny. It doesn't matter now, anyway. -Morning, Norbert. -Morning. Max, did you visit Tamar's gynecologist? Yes. And guess who else was there, two days after the murder? Yes, guess.Guess. Well?

All right. [machine humming] [groaning] [groaning] Hey, have you gone mad? Avigdor. Avigdor. Go, go. Avigdor. Avigdor, no. No. No, Avigdor. No, no. Avigdor. [sobbing] You don't want to talk to us. But you talked to Tamar. We have proof. What was the meeting about? The money or the abortion? That woman messed up Khalid's head. She was a whore. She was carrying Khalid's baby. He called Tamar and her doctor murderers. In front of witnesses. [chuckles] How stupid. How stupid. Terribly stupid. He was so stupid, he could think only of revenge. Murder in the heat of the moment. And he hid her phone at your house to punish you for your rigid stance. I know. I killed her. [sighs] That woman constantly cheated on Khalid... and murdered our grandson. [sobbing] She put our family to shame. It was my duty as a father. You've got my shirt, haven't you? Have you got a moment? [sobbing] [no audible dialogue] [doctor] He was very lucky. The first stab just missed a lung and the second went into his arm. But I've got to go. All the best. Thank you. [chattering] Excuse me. You didn't tell us the truth, Khalid. You knew that Tamar was pregnant and you were in despair because she didn't want the baby and you did. Yes, I wanted the baby. Your father awaits a long prison term. Will you really let that happen? [door closes] So... what does an artist like you want from the police? Your mother said it was important. Yes, it is. How is... Ester. Yes. Not so good. She is ill. -She has cancer. -I'm sorry to hear that. I hope that everything works out. We aren't masters of our destiny. For quite a while now... I've been living according to Halakhah. I hope God will have mercy on us. But you came to see me for other reasons. Yes, it's about... Who is this man? I don't know, but I can find out. [phone rings] Hello, David. I'm phoning because I've found out quite a lot for you. Yes? -So... -Hang on. You were right. I've got his name and he is indeed from Alon Moreh. You won't believe it, but there's some crazy story about 18,000 euros. Carrot? Anything on Brenner's knife yet? No, nothing at all. Max, will you come in there with me? I need you. Ms. Levi, you visited Mr. Brenner at the hotel the day your sister was killed. What did you discuss? You lied to us. You and Tamar did know Avigdor. You wanted to marry him, but he fell in love with your sister. What did you discuss at the hotel? Did you talk about the statement made to the police by Avigdor's mother about the money Tamar stole from his family? The statement that Avigdor retracted out of his love for Tamar? Why did you come to Berlin? To remind Tamar of our faith. No, you came to spy on your sister. You told Avigdor where his money went, what had become of Tamar, that she was pregnant by Khalid because you hoped that he'd forget Tamar and get back with you. I loved my sister. Khalid says the opposite is true. Because he hates us all. You know that, being a Jew. This Jew hates prejudice and intolerance. -Then come to Israel. -This isn't about politics. It's about jealousy and sisterly hate. It's only human and you had good reason. Of course, we were always fighting. Tamar had become a difficult person, but I loved her. Avigdor would confirm that if he were still alive. Let me tell you what Avigdor would confirm if he were alive. That he wanted Tamar back and that he'd give up everything-- Yes, thank you. Shut the door. Even give up the kibbutz in order to get her back. That was in his text message and is what he told you at the hotel. It's not a kibbutz. My God, that's fucking irrelevant. You went to the club, waited for her to take her break... and stabbed her to death. No. -My religion forbids such things. -[scoffs] Oh, really? Avigdor was at the club that night. Tamar probably turned him down. Did you know that he wanted to kill Khalid? Of course you did. After Tamar's death, Avigdor came to the factory and you convinced him that Khalid had done it. But he did. It's called "incitement to murder." You knew that Avigdor wanted to kill Khalid. I tried-- I tried to talk Avi out of it. Right, Ms. Levi, would you come with me, please. You know you couldn't live here so peacefully as a Jew if Israel didn't exist. Don't you yearn to live in Israel? Right, that's enough. Brenner is from the same village as the Levi sisters. Alon Moreh, a kind of kibbutz, all very religious. -How do you know this? -What does it matter? I have a source in Israel. Love and work should be kept separate, you said. You're just jealous. It's irrelevant. We have Tarik's confession. What if it was the religious sisters? God asked Cain, "What have you done?" Cain was a farmer like Ronit at the kibbutz and Abel was a shepherd, a nomad, just like Tamar. [laughing]Ronit didn't kill her sister. Because she's so pious? I believe her. She wanted to save Tamar. But if we believe Khalid, she hated her sister. They've always been doing it. -What? -Blaming each other. Careful, Sara, you're Jewish. An Israeli? Impossible. But Khalid, yes. What?It's what people will say. Calm down, you two. There's news from Forensics. Tamar Levi wasn't stabbed with Brenner's knife. Maybe he used a different knife. See you. Or, it was Khalid, Avigdor knew that and wanted to avenge Tamar. And Tarik merely confessed in order to protect his son. I've had enough for today. What? I'm out of here. Have a good evening, Sara.Thank you. Take a day off. You deserve it now that the case is almost solved. I'll try. See you.See you. Vera? [cell phone rings] Hello? This is Sara. Who's this? Oh, I'm Miriam Liebeskind. David can't come to the phone. Shall I give him a message? Oh, right. Just tell him thanks for his help. Bye. Miriam Liebeskind.

[dog barking] Have you seen this dog here before? That's Jenny's, isn't it? But he was run over last week. She lives just over there. Jenny! Jenny! Come on, what are you doing? No! No!Jenny. Leave me alone, you cop bitch! Leave me alone. Leave me alone, please. [sobbing] I'm not saying anything. You don't have to. I'll tell you everything, okay? I don't want to go. I don't want to go. You don't have many friends, do you, Jenny? Your best friend was your dog, Felix. It's horrible to lose your best friend, not to be greeted anymore when you get home... not to have anyone waiting for you. Hey! What do you think you're doing? You stupid little bitch. Get out of here, go on! The last thing she said before she died was, "Felix, I'm sorry." [laughs] You're a murderer. Have you lost your mind? Here, take some money. Okay? Buy yourself a new dog. She gave me 50 euros. Now get out of here! 50 euros, buy yourself a new one. Go on! [laughs] [groans] [Sara] Tamar Levi was returning from a reception probably all coked up, and didn't see the dog. According to Jenny Petzold's statement, the police told her that she was lucky Tamar hadn't reported her. Then my father can be released. I'm afraid not. [gasping] [whimpering] Help me. He saw you leave the club together and he thought-- Help me. Khalid. [Sara] And then he made it look like a robbery. [whimpers] [board falls to ground] [whimpers] All the best. Ayasha.

[David speaking Hebrew] [speaking Hebrew] [speaking Hebrew] [children laughing] [speaking Hebrew] Who are you? Miriam Liebeskind, and who are you? Who is Miriam Liebeskind? A colleague of mine. Why? Didn't she pass on my message? What message? That you should come to the door. Sorry, this is a police operation. Didn't you want to kiss me?
