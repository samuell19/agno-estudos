FRANK OLMSTEAD, YOU ARE A DELINQUENT. APPLES. YOU'VE LOST YOUR APPLES. I'VE GOT THOSE KIDS EATING SO MUCH DARN FRUIT. YOU'RE INCORRIGIBLE. MMM.I'LL SEE YOU LATER. MM.HAVE A GOOD DAY. I'LL BE HERE. HAPPY RETIREMENT. IT'S DAY ONE OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. UH... WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE? UH... I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU THE SAME QUESTION. OH, I, UH, DID A BIT OF REORGANIZING. YOU KNOW, GLASS AND BREAKABLES ON THE BOTTOM. PANS IN THE MIDDLE. WOODS AND PLASTICS ON TOP. EARTHQUAKE SAFE. DO YOU MAKE A WISH WHEN YOU RETIRE? I CAN THINK OF A FEW. THE SYMPHONY EXISTS ONLY BECAUSE OF SUCH GENEROUSDONATIONS SUCH AS YOURS. WE'LL HAVE TO, UH, CONFIRM EXACTLY HOW YOU WANTYOUR NAME TO READ. SO, UH, YOUR NAME WILL BEON THIS LIST RIGHT HERE. IN WHAT FONT? PARDON? WELL, THIS IS A SMALL... MUST BE ABOUT AN EIGHT. I BELIEVETHAT'S A NINE POINT. I'M SURPRISED YOU DON'T USE AT LEAST A TEN. WELL, IT'S THE PAGES. THE MORE PAGES WE HAVE, THE HIGHER THE FO-- AND THIS IS ALPHABETICAL.OF COURSE. WELL, WHY ISN'T IT BY SIZE... OF DONATION? OH, WELL, IT ISWITHIN EACH CATEGORY. OH. YOU MEAN... IF I WERE TO DONATE ANOTHER THOUSAND DOLLARS, WE WOULD MOVE UP TO THIS DONATION CATEGORY? THAT'S TRUE. OH. THAT LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST A TWELVE. MM-HMM. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU THREE ARE MY GO-TO TEAM. WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN PROVIDED FOR. IT'S AN ADDRESS. A HOUSE SPECIFICALLY. OUR GIVING CAMPAIGN IS WORKING. WE'VE BEEN BEQUEATHED THE PROPERTY BY THE SON OF A FORMER PARISHIONER.OH. ZONED OUT RIGHT. NO MORTGAGE. I BELIEVE IT IS THE SOLUTION TO THE DAYCARE PROGRAM. YES, WE HEARD THE PROGRAMWAS ABOUT TO BE SHUT DOWN. IS THIS HOUSE WORTH ENOUGHTO SAVE THE PROGRAM? I THINK IT IS. A CONTRACTOR WAS HIRED A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO TO REFURBISH IT. HE STARTED, BUT, WELL, HE MUST'VE FOUND WORK ELSEWHERE. WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM US? SUPERVISE A QUICK REFURBISH OF THE PROPERTY. SOME PAINT. FEW COSMETIC UPGRADES. AND THEN WE'LL SELL IT. WHATEVER WE GET FOR IT IS OURS. SO OBVIOUSLY THE BETTER IT LOOKS THE... NOW, WHY DO I SENSE A QUALIFIER? FUNDING FOR THE DAYCARE PROGRAM RUNS OUT IN SIX MONTHS. WE HAVE TO SELL IT BEFORE FUNDING RUNS OUT OR THE PROGRAM DISSOLVES AND THE CHILDREN WILL HAVE NOWHERE TO GO. WELL, THEN WE WILL DO OUR VERY BEST. THE THREE OF YOU WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN KEEPING THE DAYCARE PROGRAMGOING THIS LONG. SO I THOUGHT IT'S ONLY FITTING THAT YOU SHOULD SUPERVISE THIS. UH, WE HAVE A SMALL RESERVE. SOME PETTY CASH FOR PAINT AND THE LIKE. JUST GET IT READY FOR THE MARKET. AS I SAID, WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN PROVIDED FOR. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. ANYTHING YOU DO WILL BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. OH, NO. NO. NO! THIS IS GENIUS. WHAT? OUR DECEASED PARISHIONER LEFT THIS MESS FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO CLEAN UP. A LAST LAUGH IN PERPETUITY. BRILLIANT. IT LOOKS KINDA CROOKED, DOESN'T IT? WHAH. WHAT A DUMP. A CROOKED DUMP. OKAY. LET'S GO. OH, I CAN'T GET OUT AGAIN. OH, SURE YOU CAN. OH, THERE WE GO. OKAY. OH, MY. LOOK AT THIS. NO WAY. OH. OH. OW. WHAT--WELL, IT'S GOTA RUNNY NOSE. WHAT ARE YOU DO-- LET-- OH.AH. WHOA.UH-HUH. SEE, THAT'S AN OMEN. THAT'S A BAD OMEN. OH, THERE'S MAIL. GREAT, ELIZABETH. LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK.OKAY. OKAY.OKAY. HERE WE GO.YEAH. HOLD YOUR NOSE. HOLD YOUR NOSE. IT'S BURNIN' MY EYES. OHO HO. DO YOU THINK PASTOR WESLEY SAW THE INSIDE OF THIS HOUSE? THIS IS TERRIBLE. DID THE CONTRACTOR LEAVE A SUICIDE NOTE? WELL, THERE'S NO ROOM FOR A WALK-IN CLOSET. OF COURSE, A WALK-IN CLOSET IS A MOOT POINT WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A WALK-IN KITCHEN. OH, LOOK--LOOK WHEREYOU'RE STEPPING. LOOKS LIKE THE DECOR WAS EARLY AMERICAN FARM ANIMAL. YEAH. WAIT A MINUTE. THIS PLACE IS SUPPOSEDTO BE FIXED, PAINTED, AND READY BEFOREMY NEW HAIR COLOR FADES? I DON'T THINK SO. OH, ELIZABETH. NOW, IT--YOU KNOW WHAT, IT--IT COULD HAVE POTENTIAL. OH. WELL, MAYBE A LITTLE POTENTIAL. OH, THIS IS SUCH A HELPLESSLITTLE HOUSE. IT'S NOT A HELPLESS HOUSE. A HOUSE CAN'T BE HELPLESS. A PUPPY IS HELPLESS, NOT A HOUSE. I MEAN, THIS HOUSEJUST HASN'T BEEN LOVED. OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS PLACE DOESN'T NEED PAINT, THIS PLACE NEEDS DYNAMITE. I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THIS. THERE GOES MISS NEGATIVITY. PASTOR, YOU DON'T JUST WANT USTO GET CALLUSES AND BLISTERS, YOU WANT US TO GET THE PLAGUE. OH, PASTOR, THIS HOUSE NEEDS MORE THAN PAINT. THE CABINETS ARE BROKEN.TOTALLY BUSTED. AND THE WALLS HAVE HOLES. NOT JUST LITTLE HOLES, BUT JUST BIG HOLES! AND, YOU KNOW, THE WOOD AROUND THE WINDOWS, IT'S ALL DECAYING.ROTTED RIGHT OUT. AND I HAVE A QUESTION. WHERE ARE THE OTHERS? WHO? ALL THOSE OTHER PARISHIONERSWHO VOTED TO SAVE THE DAYCARE. MOST OF THEM HAVE FULL-TIME JOBS. AND THOSE THAT AREN'T WORKING AND ARE WILLING TO VOLUNTEER AT ALL ARE SPREAD THIN ON OTHER PROJECTS. YOU'RE OUR FOUNDATION. AND FOR THIS PARTICULAR JOB, I NEEDED SOME GET IT DONE PEOPLE. THAT'S YOU THREE. I DEPEND ON YOU. WHAT DID YOU AGREE TO? I DIDN'T COMMIT US TO IT. BIRDIE DID. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUASSOCIATE WITH LOWER COMPANIONS. ELIZABETH, AT YOUR LEVEL, YOU SHOULD BE SPEARHEADING A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN, A FUNDRAISER. YOU SHOULD BE CHAIRING THE HEART ASSOCIATION BALL. NOT SUPPORTING A LITTLE RINKY-DINK BABYSITTING SERVICE. I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S NOT NOBLE. BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF WOMENOUT THERE WHO CAN MANAGE AT THAT LEVEL. YOU CAN'T DO THIS. CAN'T. YOU MEAN I CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE I'M NOT CAPABLE OR BECAUSE YOU WON'T LET ME? BOTH. ELIZABETH. HEY, THE DOORBELL WORKS. UH, ALMOST. COME ON IN. THIS PLACE GIVES NEW MEANING TO THE PHRASE "ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK." ELIZABETH, DOES THIS MEANTHAT YOU'RE GONNA HELP US? I GUESS IT DOES. AW, I'M SO HAPPY. AW. OH. HEY. NOW, SEE. DOESN'T THAT MAKE-- THEY MAKE IT LOOK FUN? PLEASE.ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I DON'T HAVE TIMETO GO AROUND HIRING CONTRACTORS. OH, WELL, PASTOR WESLEY SAID WE CAN'T SPEND A LOT OF MONEYON CONTRACTORS. OTHERWISE WE WON'T HAVE ANY FUNDS LEFT FOR THE SCHOOL PROGRAM. WELL, THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS THINKING. WELL, WHAT WERE YOUTHINKING ABOUT?

I WONDERWHAT KIND OF NAILS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO USETO BUILD A WALL. SAUCE. WHAT IS THAT? UH, WE LIVE ACROSS THE STREET FROM A POTATO. WHAT'S A POTATO? A HARLEY-DAVIDSON.

WHAT HE SAID WAS WE SHOULDN'T LOOK AT IT AS A CURE. BUT, SWEETHEART, IT MIGHT GIVE US MORE TIME. THANK YOU. YEAH, WITH SOME PRETTY STRONG SIDE EFFECTS. MINIMAL TIME AND ALMOST A GUARANTEE I'LL FEEL WORSE. FRANK, I--I'M NOT GOINGBACK TO THE HOUSE. I'M GOING TO STAY RIGHT HERE. YOU CAN'T. OH, YES, I CAN.

YOU THINK STAYINGIN A COMPLICATED MARRIAGE IS THE EASY WAY OUT? THINK SO.THERE'S NOTHING EASY ABOUT MAKING A PROMISEAND LIVING UP TO IT. WELL, I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS EASY, I SAID IT WAS THE EASY WAY OUT. DO YOU THINK IT'S EASY TO ARRANGE A BIRTHDAY CAKE FOR YOUR HUSBAND'S SECRETARY/GIRLFRIEND AND PRETEND THAT YOU'RE NONE THE WISER? DO YOU THINK IT'S EASY TO ARRANGE A BUSINESS TRIP FOR YOUR HUSBAND TO A ROMANTIC PLACE UNDER THE GUISE OF A MEDICAL CONFERENCE WHEN YOU KNOW ALL THE TIMETHAT HE'S JUST TRYING TO, UH, IMPRESS SOME PASSING LOVER WITH AN ADDICTIVE SAMPLING OF THE, UH, PRIVILEGED LIFE.

ANGRY THAT I DON'T KNOWHOW TO BALANCE A CHECK BOOK OR MAKE A BUDGETOR DO THE TAXES. SO I COME OUT HEREAND I SIT AND I-I LOOK AT THE DIRT. AND I-I TRY TO REMIND MYSELF THAT A VERY GENTLE MAN TAUGHT ME THAT-- THAT THE GROUND IS WORKING ITS HARDEST WHEN IT LOOKS BARREN. THAT THE MOST DIFFICULT PERIODIS JUST BEFORE IT BLOSSOMS. OH, GOD. OH, HOW DID I FORGET THAT? OH. I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING LEFT. I BRUSHED EVERYTHING OFF THAT WASN'T IMPORTANT, AND-- PEOPLE SAY YOU HAVE A-- AN EXQUISITE HOME, YOU'VE RAISED A GREAT SON. ONE WOULD THINK-- CAN YOU IMAGINE WISHING MY SHALLOW, SELF-RIGHTEOUS LIFE ON ANYONE? YOU KNOW, WHEN STAN ASKED TO MARRY ME, THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT OF WAS THAT IT SEEMED LOGICAL. YOU KNOW WHAT HE IS? HE IS A GREAT MAN. ALL MY HUSBAND WANTS IS FOR ME TO BE HOME WITH HIM. AND I HIDE SO THAT HE WON'T SEE THAT I'M AFRAID. BECAUSE YOU KNOW HE'S GONNA ASK ME WHY. SO I HIDE AND LET HIM THINK THAT IT'S HIS FAULT. AND I KNOW HOW THAT MUST MAKE HIM FEEL. BUT I DO IT ANYWAY. I DID THE WORK ON THAT HOUSE FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS. BUT IT'S--IT'S-- IT'S THE BEST THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME AND I DON'T EVER, EVER, EVER WANT TO FORGET ANY OF IT. BIRDIE! WE GOT TO GET GOIN' TO THE PERMIT OFFICE. COME ON. GET ON. OKAY.
