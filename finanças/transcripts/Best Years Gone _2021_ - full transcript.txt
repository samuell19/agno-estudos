(crickets chirping) (bear roaring) Where'd he go? Where'd he go, where? (Gil panting) (Gil whimpers) Stay, go! Bad bear! (Gil gasping) Bad bear, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay! Oh, Lord God, I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! Hey God. It's me, Gil! Look it, I know we don't chit chat much and you know that I am far from perfect, and if anybody deserved to put on trial here, it's Gil Gilles. But God, please don't let me get eaten by a bear. A bear, no! Oh, I mean, I might've pulled a leg, man, a couple times, but you're all about forgiveness, right? It's about forgiveness, right? (gasping) Oh, thank you, thank you! I'll take accountability for whatever I've done! What'd I do? Wait, did I kill that girl? Did I kill that girl? Come on, give me a sign! (branches snapping) (Gil screaming) (Gil grunts) Black flag (grunts), black flag. (lively banjo music) (engines roaring) Push-to-pass, I knew she was gonna be trouble. Hey, handsome, got yourself an occasion for that hangover? It was a Thursday. (both chuckle) (Sylvia shushes) (Gil chuckles) I think you might need a little hair of the dog. I do, right? (glasses clink) (glasses thud) Oh, yeah. That's just the kind of woman I'd been praying for. A few dents, minor scratches, but runs well. (soft music) What I didn't count on was those identical demon spawn twin daughters of hers. (horse whinnies) (horse neighs) That was a real kick in the pants. (leaves crunching) (birds chirping) Oh yeah, I, I think I can maybe fix it, yeah. Hey girls, this here gentleman here is Gil Gilles. He's offered to take a look at the Subaru. Ain't that kind of him? How you girls doing? Mm, friendly type. You know, I have been known to make myself a pretty mean Hamburger Helper. What do I gotta do to have you stay for dinner? Well, if you insist, but I don't wanna intrude on no family time. Them girls, they're just overprotective is all. You pay no attention to them, all right? You got no man looking after things here? No, their daddy's serving life in Jackson. Robbery gone wrong. Can I get you something to drink? You got any cold suds? You know, I think I might. Huh, if you agree to have one with me, well then I just might have to have me some of that Hamburger Helper and some cold suds. Deal. All right, all right. (mellow music) That woman spoke my language. It was more than just a good time, more than just the laughter, the loud music, and the libations. It took us far away from our past failures. When I met my Sylvia I knew my bachelor days were over. [Julie] Gil, I'm gonna be late for work. All that whining ain't making anything drop faster. Gross, Mom! He'll be out in a minute! Why is he here? He has a home, kind of. (Gil passing gas) [Gil] Ooh, yeah. You're disgusting. [Gil] Your attitude is disgusting. (toilet flushing) (air freshener spraying) Pizza rolls, I think I need me a catch cake. (sniffs) (lazy music) Hey. Morning, Gil. Hey, Peg. You need my help with something? What? Something you wanna say to me? [Gil] What? Why you staring at me? Not now. I poured you some coffee. Oh thank you, but you know what they say? Waste not. I think it's in the Bible. [Julie] You're not even dressed? Honey, I'm just, I'm not feeling very well today. I was hoping Peggy, you might switch shifts with me, please? Please? I was already planning on it. (Sylvia sighs with relief) I could drop Julie off at the campground. Thanks. - It's okay. I might be late tonight. Jim offered to take me on his boat. I thought your hair looked extra snazzy this morning. Peggy, stay outta my head. Let's go. [Gil] Hey, you just have a good day at work. Surprised you remember what that word even means. [Sylvia] Hey. Sylvia. I try with those two. I really do. I, they're just playing dirty air. (rooster crows) (train horn blares) I was the youngest of six raised in the upper peninsula. My daddy was a hard man and mama deserted our family when I was 12. She ran off with a Finnish copper miner. Can't blame her. I left home at 13 and never looked back. I ain't seen any of my siblings since and I don't care to. I heard my mama died of lung cancer a few years back. Ain't that a bag of donuts. [Sylvia] Child, you have got to slow down. My feet are killing me after my shift. [Peggy] Mom, Julie could be hurt or worse. [Sylvia] What are you talking about? She probably just enjoying some private time alone. She went boating with Jim earlier and I haven't heard from her since. Hey, what do you mean she went boating with Jim? Who is Jim? (dramatic music) No. Do you know Jim? Huh? Have you met him? You know, this is something you might consider sharing with your mother. Pick it up. Come on. (hand thuds on door) Gil, baby? Hey, it's me. I'm coming in. Don't shoot me. (door creaks) Gil. Gil, hey. Gil, baby. I need to talk to you for a minute. Hey. [Peggy] Gil, wake up. [Sylvia] Gil, come on. Hey. Hey baby. What are you doing in here? Julie went boating with Jim and I haven't heard from her since. Please, can I have your help looking for her? This is the first time that one of Sylvia's brats asked anything of me. I've surely have my days where I wish those two would just disappear, but just maybe this situation would change things. All right, enough of this cackle fest. If we're gonna chop down the Christmas tree, then we gotta get going. We'll have that boat in the water by first light. Come on. Let's go. (energetic music) Man, are we happy to see you guys. Heck of a way to meet Julie's family. It's nice to finally meet you, Jim. [Peggy] Why didn't you call? We would have if our phones had services. Kind of ran outta gas. Probably should have been paid more attention to the gauges. Yeah, a little gas check might saved us all a lot of problems here. You also lost the anchor. Oh, anchor too. Hey, uh, Gil, you think you could give me a tow? That's a negative. All right. Let's go. Got things to. (boat engine roars) (wistful music) I used to dream of being that cool stepdad, being that I never had much of a family. I think it was a fantasy I often got lost in. I try to do right by these brats. They're just plain uppity, entitled and ungrateful. At least I only have to deal with one of them soon. [Sylvia] People been saying the same thing about us at their age. Yeah, I'm worried about their generation, bunch of backmarkers. They just don't know yet, that's all. Oh, they will. (Sylvia sighs) (thunder rumbles) (Gil sighs) You ever want anything different? Had any dreams or anything? Course, didn't we all? (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) Dreams are for young people. Yeah. (Gil exhales) Life has been destroying youthful dreams as long as I can remember. (thunder cracks) (bell rings) Who's you, Betty Lou? Okay. Okay. This is none o' your business, but since I'm in kind of a good mood today, I'm gonna give you some scoop. My father's brother owns this place, so naturally I came over to run it. That makes me the manager. Unfortunately, when I got here somebody else thinks they already wearing that title. Understand? Hm, not really. No. Okay, I don't need any more problems with her thinking I'm into her man. So I don't know if you're trying to be some sort of cowboy or something, but I'm still not into you. Okay. You're not my type. I think she just insulted me. And when did that happen? This morning, right before Emmet left for Arizona to visit his mother. (alarm beeping) (fire sizzling) - Sorry, sorry! - You are taking forever! - You're in my kitchen! - I mean it! Every single one of them that's out there is waiting. Go over there. Don't touch anything. No, let me take this out. (Gil laughs) (kitchen staff bickering) Yeah. Don't laugh. It isn't funny. Oh, it's the funniest thing I've seen all week. - I cannot work with you! - Get... Hey babe. Mandy's gonna give me a ride home, okay? So I'll see you later tonight. Kisses. (lips smack) So I'm not really sure what you're seeing in him, 'cause I don't see what you see. Just 'cause I'm letting you drive me home don't mean we're friends, especially you keep bad mouthing my a man. Well, I wasn't asking to be your friend. Forget it. Now I'm not saying nothing. What? I'm just telling you, everybody in this town is a little weird, so I got my eyes everywhere. And from working in the salon for so many years, I know what I see and what I see was your two daughters walking down the street with not a lot of fabric on 'em. What are you talking about, not a lot of fabric on 'em? [Mandy] And then I seen your man's truck in the same area. Like I said, I worked at a salon. What are you saying? I'm just saying it's weird and people at the salon would be talking. (Sylvia scoffs) (engine whirs) [Arcade Machine] (indistinct) Ready, set, go. So that's why you so gassed up to get to work every day. What are you doing here? Getting tired of you sassing me all the time, little girl. What brings you here, Gil? This. I retrieved it from the shore and thought I'd be helpful and bring it back, but as always, you got everything you want from me. Back to talking down to Gil again. (anchor thuds) Listen, I love your mama and you and your sister are just gonna have to get used to them facts. And you, you better be careful. She's gonna start clerking your course once she gets what she wants. Thanks, Gil. (ball bouncing faintly) First are worst. Game respects game. All right. You two have a good day. You know, (soft music) life, life is about survival and it's about gratitude. See, I'm grateful. I'm grateful it's a beautiful day. I'm grateful I'm alive. I'm grateful I got your mom in my life. See, if you're lucky, you'll learn about the power of love. You're drunk. No, I'm not. Your mama has got me drinking light beer for my day drinking and everybody knows you can't get drunk on light beer. So no, I got things to do. (foot clinks) (Gil yells) Drive through pain. Good day. [Arcade Machine] Ready, set, go. Can't believe you have to deal with that every day. Okay, Jules. I'll see you later tonight. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Love you. Bye. (laughs) Oh, I think Jules is falling. She's gone out with that Jim guy again. And Peggy is out with the girls, which... Which means gone, gone. Mama bear's got no kids. (Sylvia chuckles) It's all good. (Gil sighs) I'm counting on you being a good one. Oh, I try. Try ain't good enough. You lay a finger on me or one of the girls in anger and I will kill you. You believe my words? Oh yeah, I believe your words. Good. Here. You know- 'Cause I would kill for what I love and I do love you Gil Gilles. I'd protect what I love with my dying breath. I ain't got much, but I do love deep what's mine. Let me take this opportunity, Sylvia, to apologize for anything that my idiotic mouth might have spouted when I'd been drinking. Okay. (laughs) You just saying that on account of me talking killing. No, no, I'm not. Serious moment, Sylvia. Serious moment. You need to know, no, listen to me. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me, you know that. I sat on a bar stool for years praying to God to send me someone to love and who would love me for all my flaws. And he sent you. Without you, I would've just died alone in that trailer. And you're the only family I got. I'm feeling so dance stimulated right now. Really? (Sylvia chuckles) Now is that like kiss dance stimulated or Peter Frampton dance stimulated? (swinging music) ♪ Shimmer, shade and golden shine ♪ ♪ Busy polishing your shrine ♪ ♪ Happy living deep inside your mind ♪ ♪ Doesn't take a- ♪ (Gil snoring) (feet tapping) Sad, isn't it? I didn't expect you to be back until tomorrow. I didn't have enough money to go out after. Plus I really wanted to come home and pack. I can't believe I'm actually going. Look what you'll be missing. I hope Gil got the car running better. He was working on it a good part of the day, but you know Gil. Does he ever finish anything? (Peggy sighs) (dramatic music) Them girls are starting to green my rubber. (ominous music) (jaunty music) (bouncy music) Mom up? [Julie] Nope. [Gil] Your mom ain't quite feeling the groove this morning. Wonder why. You know, your mama really works hard to take care of the two of you. Maybe you should try, I don't know, maybe giving her a little bit more appreciation. Why are you here? Oh, I'm good enough to wrench on your vehicle all afternoon, but not good enough to park here with the love of my life? Okay, just because your mom and I like to party and blow off steam don't mean that we don't handle our business. Help me finish packing. Tell mom I love her and I'll call her once I get settled in my dorm. Yeah. I'm right on that. (sighs) Unbelievable little brats. (car ignition sputters) Oh, that didn't sound real good. Maybe I, it'll hold. (car engine hums) Well, well, what do we have here? And just whose skivvies are these? (Gil gasps) Did I miss 'em? Are they gone? Yeah, I think they're gone. I thought Peggy would have at least say goodbye. [Gil] You know how them girls are. Oh, I look awful. No baby, you're naturally beautiful. That's just a polite way of saying frumpy. (laughs) No way, you are like white snake hood slidin' hot. You are baby, I'm telling you. I know. Looky, I'm gonna run up to Tink's and get some smokes. You need anything? Oh. - Aspirin. - Somebody's got a headache. I think we're out. All right. I'll go get that. - Okay. - Okay. Well, I'll be back in just a few. (car sputters) What's that noise? I don't know. Gil was trying to fix it, but I'm gonna grab a road coffee. Oh now, won't you look who done come seen ol' Tinker? How are you doing? I'm all right. I reckon. I can't hear nothing. You gotta speak up, honey. I have to use the bathroom. Well, go right back in there, and... I just cleaned it two weeks ago. Hey there, how are you doing? What's the matter with your car? I heard a rattle when you pulled up. Yeah, it's making a weird noise. How long has it been doing that? I don't know. I just heard it today. Here. Hold spit cup for me. I heard you got into university. [Peggy] Yeah. What are you gonna study? [Peggy] Just basic courses until I figure out what I wanna major in. Well, that's all right. (metal thunks) Here's your rattle. (birds chirping) (horn beeps) (Gil muttering) Come on! Damn. Hey, you scrutineer, Tinker. I told them already I fixed it. Well, there ain't no harm in taking a look, Gil. According to what I see, it looks like you bled the brakes just fine. It's a quality fix. Hear what he said? Quality fix. You're still a stupid drunk. Oh, I'm stupid. You know what I saw her sister doing the other day on her fancy phone with the little looky wooky thingy? She was looking up how to boil water. You know what that is, that is fire plus water equals boil. You imagine that? But somehow I'm the stupid one. Yeah. That's what I said. You know how stupid you sound? Try not to do any Tide pod shooters when you're away at college, okay? Shut up, Gil. Oh, nice way to win an argument. You pick up your participation award at I don't give a flying flag. Yo, you're gonna have settle down, son. The world's a changing. You're just going around everywhere, just like this, all coiled up like a snake. You're ready to strike at people all the time. They don't know what to think. Was that mine? I reckoned it's your'n. I found it laying on the intake manifold and she pulled up here, said car's a rattling and that's what I found in there. I got to get a few things. Them Tide pots really work, get your plates clean. (door creaks) (toilet flushes) Too good to take a deep break at the house, I see. Real classy. What are you doing here? Uh, getting smokes and some aspirin for your ma. You know she has to open at the midway, right? Yes, I do. Thank you, Tinker. You're so sweet. Young in', I try. Listen now, on your trip, when you get back bring that car in here and I'll put you a new belt on her, put you a deco on there, but it'll be all right through the trip. Okay. But stay away from them rest stops. I will. It was great seeing you, Tinker. Good to see you, honey. I'll be in the car. Gil, you better be good to my mom and my sister while I'm away. [Gil] Yeah, dirty air. Shut your teenage talk box. But you too. Tinker, can you put this on my mom's tab? What'd you say, honey? Can you put this on my mom's tab? I surely can. Thank you. [Tinker] Good to see you. Good. We can put a few things on the tab, right? Kind of like to have cash. (bright music) (engines roaring) (crowd cheering) (metal crunching) [Gil] Like you, Gil. (Gil sighs) Sorry, Ike. [Ike] That's my, let me go. (siren blaring) That's my car. (yells) [Announcer] Gibenos is scarce. Fire through there. Checking. Getting Gil out. (Gil sighing) Maybe the panties won't even come up. (Sylvia yells) (bottles crashing) I thought we already talked about all this. It can change that fast for Syliva, from love to hate and back again. Add half dozen beers and double jeopardy rules are in full effect. Her mood changes seem to be more often. Why did you ask if Julie was gonna be here when we got here? Because I wanted to know if we had the house to ourselves. - Oh. - What? She already got that boyfriend, Jim. Oh right, the guy has a better truck than you do. That entitled turpile had his mommy and daddy buy it for him. No! (bottle clangs) Oh, you gonna cry, Gil? (Gil panting) I'm not a wealthy man, Sylvia. Love is all I got. And I see that aint nothing no more. (glass thuds) (liquid glugging) (dance music) ♪ Back to this, you ready for this ♪ (phone ringing) (Gil sighs) Sylvia, I re... Whoa, slow down, slow down. I can't understand you when you're crying. Arrested? Wait, let me put you on speakerphone. My heart knows how to pick 'em. Seems Sylvia had herself a one person ramp run. Got so wasted she woke up and thought she was late for work. She didn't remember showering or dressing, but remembered climbing into the Subaru and backing out of the drive. Constable Calvin Greeney-Pierce found Sylvia in a ditch, passed out just down the road. They confiscated her driver's license and they put her in county lock-up until her hearing. And my real fear was her not getting her daily intake o' drink. After so many years, the devil's drink not only has it hooks into your body, but your mind, your soul. (train bell ringing) Excuse me. That's, uh, that's my woman. That's, that's the woman I love. Why does this have to be the only place to eat and drink in town? You wanna go somewhere else? Hey, what's going on with your mama? Heard she went to the hospital and now she's stuck in county. Damn Calvin Greeney, I swear he's drunk in his cop car half the time cruising around. Mom'll live. Your mama has given you the best years of her life and that's what she's gonna get from you? You and your sister just a couple of snooty brats who need to be taken down a few pegs. Yeah, why don't you just get outta here, man? Jim, why don't you shut up? I don't think I was talking to you at all. I ain't gonna tell you twice, old man. Old man? [Jim] Feeling tough? Oh look, it, you know what? This ain't punk locker room posturin' time. I would beat the shiny off you. [Jim] You wanna go? - You wanna go? - Yeah. What do you want? What you want? You want some boxing? Boom, would you also like karate with this whole thing? What you want? (woops) - Okay, okay, okay. Please, stop, stop, stop it. - What you want? What you want, Jim? - This little cat fight you boys got brewing's gonna stop now, okay? What you want? What you want? Chill, take a breath. Take a breath. [Gil] What, what, what? Both of you realize this ain't happenin' in here. Uh-uh. You, get him out of here. (Gil makes verbal whip sounds) Go sit! I ain't gonna sit. I want play some darts. Who wants play some darts? I'm see some money. And Mandy, how about you get me a double on the rocks. All right? [Mandy] I'm not getting you nothing. Damn kids these days. (bright music) (darts thwacking) I talk big. I was gonna see my love set free at any cost. Her companionship and lovin' had truly saved me. (phone ringing) Oh. I'm gonna change that. Wait, I'm putting it on speaker phone. Don't go nowhere. Sylvia? [Sylvia] Gil, I need to borrow just a little bit of money. I got into some trouble. Uh, what do you want me to do about it? [Sylvia] Ha, not funny. Come on baby. You know I'm good for it. [Gil] I might be able to contribute like a hundred or something. [Sylvia] I gotta get outta here. (Gil's lips smack) I don't feel good. (sighs) Um, I, I'll, I'll see what I can do. [Sylvia] They're making me go. Love you. (lips smacking) Sylvia? Sylvia? What the heck. (sniffs) It's beer. (laughs) (bright music) 'Sup, Rowdy. Rowdy, Rowdy rooster. (toilet flushes) (bell dings) (insect buzzing) (Gil yelling) Call it wisdom or luck, it's been a long time since I myself have walked through those was steely doors to freedom. I don't recall much of the last event, other than I had an ample amount of bruises on my body. Apparently it was from resisting arrest. So you take care, all right? I'll be praying for you. (paper crinkling) Come on. Let's get out of this dump. (Eddie sighs) Mr. Gilles. Eddie. (engine roaring) (tires squeak) [Sylvia] I'm not feeling very well. [Gil] I'll be right back. Stay in the truck, alright? When I was in the hospital the doctor did an evaluation. They said I had some type of psychosis. (sniffs) I don't know what that means. (Sylvia whimpering) (yells) No, no, no, no. Not the beer. Wait, Sylvie, I'm coming. I got it, baby. Here baby, they're going overboard. Get it down. You good? Oh my God. Oh, slow down. Slow down. We got a lot. Let it work. Let it work. It's all right. There you go. There you go. See, see? You're good. There you go. Slow, slow, slow. Whoa, what are you doing? (Sylvia yells) Whoa, whoa, whoa. - What is it? Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no. - Get it off of me! - What are you talking about? (Sylvia gibbering) [Gil] Sylvia, no, come back here! Sylvia, got go nowhere. Stay with the truck. [Sylvia] Please, he's gonna kill me. Killer's gonna kill me. - You got nothing. - Look at... You got nothing. You got nothing on you. Nothing is on you at all. Nothing, honey. You'll be fine. Get back in it. Get back in the truck. Please, it's me, honey. Stay with me. Get back in. Get back in the truck. (speaks faintly) (Sylvia sobs) Stay in the truck. Stay in the truck. (Sylvia panting) What? Look at them. No, no, no. They're gonna kill me. It's all right. (speaks faintly) (hand tapping on door) What's going on, Harold? Huh? No, no. No, no, no, no, no. I can't go back. I can't go back, they're killing me. Sylvia, can I help here? - They're gonna kill. - Sylvia. Sylvia, no, Sylvia! I can't go back. I can't. - Greeney! [Sylvia] Can't go back. Can't. (ominous music) (imagined growling) I see you! I see you! I do. What's going on, Harold? I don't know. She's been misfiring like this ever since I picked her up at the hospital. I think she needs to go back. Sylvia's done gone crazier than a doogle over there. She says she's got a bomb. She's turned my place up. Need some help! She doesn't have a bomb, Greeney. She's sick. 221 to central. We're gonna be transporting a female to county general. That's gonna be on a PRT. (Sylvia panting) Can't kill me. I know it. I know it. You can't kill me. (birds tweeting) Don't get behind that wheel, Harold. You do, you're going to jail. I smelled beer on your breath. You copy me? Copy. Seen many mood swings outta Sylvia, some being womanly swings and some being saucey, swilly swings, but this particular swing was different. This swing was off the playground and it had me worried. The love of my life is in a bad place. And me without her love, it puts me in a bad place. We're connected by our love. If she crashes, we could both end up in the junkyard. And many people just don't give a damn. It's mainly true about me. They could care less if I had a roof over my head, food on my table or just anybody to love me or let me love 'em back. To everybody, save Sylvia, I'm just garbage. Yeah. She's resting. I, I don't know. I'm still waiting to see the doctor. Okay. I'll let you know. Love you. I wanted to thank you for taking such good care of my mom. It's what I do. Listen, she's calm now, but what happens when the sedation wears off? I don't want to have to cuff her to bed. Honestly, what do you see happening with her? Honestly, if she doesn't quit drinking, you're looking at more hospital trips, more jail time and very likely an early death. Is there anything we can do? Can try getting her to rehab. How do we do that? You wait. We can't. You can't make anybody do anything they don't want to do. I mean, all the interventions, all the hospital trips in the world won't make a difference unless she wants to get better. She has to be able to push past whatever pain brought her here and choose to live. (melancholic music) How's she doing? She's gonna be fine. Is this family? I'll call if there's any change. [Gil] I heard from a buddy who's in maintenance at the hospital. He said that Sylvia did start to get better. She eventually got well enough to be released. Did those girls call me? Peggy, stop worrying. I don't know where Gil is. I hope he drinks himself to death. Be the best thing that ever happened to mom. [Gil] Like it kicked in the butt by a Budweiser horse. You can't imagine how low I felt being diminished to roach status. I mean, she was wishing that I would just die. Those are the evil thoughts for sure inside those twins, but I do need to take a real look at myself, try to see those hard truths that are buried deep within. (uplifting music) Outside my own insecurities, I do have to ask, "Would my true love be better off without me?" 'Cause we do wanna work on your stretching, just getting in there just a little bit deeper. - Yes. Your hands seem a little tight. (laughs) I agree. - Yeah. - I agree. [Gil] Jealousy issues aside, do I want the best for my love? Would she be happier with someone, anyone else? Oh, I'll, (phone ringing) I'll be back next week. I promise. Great. Thank you for calling Studio One Eleven. This is is Tas speaking. Are you ready to change your li- What kind of name is Tas? (slow country music) [Bar Patron] Hells bells. What is it? He has played every sad song on that jukebox. He ain't been this bad since Shirley. We've all been there one time or another. You know, I thought she was going to blow up my store. You're kidding me? I am not. You know, I think he'd be much better off just to leave her be. Oh yeah. You're probably right. You know, there's only three things that a man needs to be happy. Three of 'em. You wanna know what they are? You're going to tell me. Oh yeah. Number one, your favorite gun. M16 all day long. Number two, your favorite car. 1966 GTO 389. And that third. Yeah? (Tinker laughs) I can't remember that third. I done forgot it. (chuckles) I don't know what it was. Honey, you take that. That's cold, but I gotta get to the tractor. I'm running late anyway.

[Gil] No. Yeah, me neither, and between you and me it's getting really hard, 'cause I don't really know what I'm doing here. And her daughter's so tight-lipped too. Maybe that's because she doesn't like me. What Julie like or don't like don't matter nothing to me. They're just a couple of nasty girls that best keep out Gil Gilles' way.

Good afternoon, folks. Can we help you with something? You already have, just by being here. Sylvia, I'm here to serve your court appearance documents. Well, maybe you can do that without a smug smile on your fat face. Don't you think she's been through enough already? (papers thud) Consider yourself served, Sylvia. You know, in my experience, most people get exactly what they're deserving. You all have a wonderful day now. I ain't never gonna get this past me, am I? God never gives you anything more than what you can handle. He'll take something off your plate. Typically, when someone's got a job they need to show up to do it. So I ask ya, how am I gonna have a worker that doesn't work, hmm? I'm sorry. I should have called. Unfortunately I couldn't for a few days. I've got some personal stuff in the back. Can I just grab it and I'll be outta your way? Go flush my fluids and I'll be right back. Okay. (Mandy clears her throat) Have a seat. As you know, my area of expertise is really in the salon, so if you're ready to start working. Yes. Yes, I can start. I promise I'll show up. Thank you. Oh, thank you. You really are a friend. (chuckles) Oh, now you wanna be my friend? Okay. Yes. Gil, Gil, she gave me my job back. When I was taking a pit stop I asked God to help with your job situation. (energetic music) I think we need a victory lap celebration! ♪ In the dark, dark, dark, the dark of light ♪ Just one, right? ♪ I have no worries, because I'm white ♪ ♪ And all the cops give me soda pops ♪ [Gil] Hm, all right. Feeling it? Yeah! (glasses clink) [Gil] Yeah. ♪ Lord, thank you for this fate ♪ Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go! (cans pop) (foot thuds) (door creaks) What happened? Gil happened. (door thudding) Mom! Mom! [Jim] Come on, come on. [Julie] Mom! No, I'm not doing this again. Mom, mom! - Come, on. Please, please. Just go home. [Jim] All right. (door creaking) (Julie sighs) (ominous music) We're doing Christmas. That's what you wanted. Hold this ladder, boy. Come here! Help! Boy, I told you to hold the ladder. What, you gonna cry? Pick up that lip. It's gonna get dirty. Get me another beer. I said go get me another beer! God's sake. (ladder rattling) Oh. (dark music) A life of highs and lows, losing my only family, my beloved Shirley, and now this mess with Sylvia. But love is a sacred gift and I'll play our game of hearts until the final flag is waved. (Gil grunting) (Gil groans) (Gil groans) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (Gil panting) (Gil whimpering) Come on. (zipper whirs) (Gil yells) (glass shatters) (Gil sniffs) (music lulls) (dramatic music) (tarp rustles) (boot thuds) (engine roars) (tires screech) (upbeat music) Any way you cut it, this is not looking good for me. (car door thuds) [Female Pat] Grab me. Okay, grab me. - 61, 62. - Okay. Okay, let go. - 63, 64, 65. - Oh, no get me. (ominous music) (bottle rattles) [Male Pat] You, uh, you okay there? Yeah, I'm fine. Here. So, uh, I see you noticing these old pictures here. Name's Pat Patterson and this pretty lady right here is my better half, Pat. Imagine that, two people in all the world meant for each other - And we're both named pat. - Pat. Pat doesn't like to brag, but he was quite the specimen back in our competition days. He still is, but added couple of extra pasty bells. Oh, come on now, Patty. Patty, no, I can't, I can't help myself. She makes the best pasties in all the world. - I do. - She even makes the, uh... Uh, gluten. Gluten free. Gluten free are best. The gluten free pasties. Got a thing, got- I'll take one of those, your cheapest six pack and then these zigzags, 20 on pump four. Okay, I'll do that. (till beeping) All right, then. Okay. You want a bag for this? Okay. Okay, the total is 28.17. [Male Pat] Okay. Got the beer going. Hope you don't have far to go. 28, 18, 28, 19, 28, 20, 28, 21, 28- Okay, just, just, just keep it. [Female Pat] Oh, thank you. You're so nice, thank you. [Male Pat] So what, are you up here visiting friends, are ya? Yeah. You know, we got just down the road, a couple of ticks, you got, uh, you got the Red Bear Lodge. You know it's, uh, a combination. The Red Bear Lodge. Bears and red colors, so up there we've got the big beer- Everything's red. Yep. It's a favorite color up here. Ah, thank you. [Male Pat] Okay then. All right. [Female Pat] Have, have a safe trip, 'ey? - Yeah. - Yeah. You know, I never laid eyes on him before. Me neither. A nice fella. Spot me again. Okay hun. Okay, now Patty. Here we go, dahl. Get up there now, come on. Oh yo, my golly. (car engine humming) (birds calling) [Gil] In my youth, my cousin Ike and I used to look for the right places to break in to party and steal car parts. The chain across the drive usually means this is a vacation home for trolls, those living under the bridge, meaning the owners are gone. (bolt cutters clacking) (steady music) (tense music) (gunshot booms) Whoa! (engine humming) (tires squeak) (dramatic music) Hey, you don't get off this property in 30 seconds I'm gon' drop ye like a bad habit. (gun clicks) (gunshot booms) [Gil] Uh, crazy braud. (gunshot booms) [Nina] I heard that! (Gil muttering) (gun clicking) (gunshot booms) (car engine roaring) [Man] Hey, Nina, what in the world are you shooting at out here? Claim jumper. Oh, I got, I got $47 in cash. I got some canned goods and I got this. I don't know what it is, but I'm gonna make a lamp outta the son of a gun. Now come on in the house. We got sheets on the bed in here. (crickets chirping) (phone ringing) [Gil] Hello? Sylvia, baby? She's in the hospital again, you piece of crap. Because of you. Julie? You know that ain't possible Gil, because you murdered her. Peggy look, I don't know what happened. Honest. You better hope the law finds you first, Gil. (door creaking) What a pig's sty. - Sir. - Yeah. The tap we put on Sylvia's phone paid off. The daughter called Gilles with it and he picked up. We get a trace? Partial. We did find paperwork to another vehicle though. He's running. Our best guess is he's headed toward the bridge. We've gotta find those kids before somebody else gets hurt or worse. The big question now, Mr. Harold Gilles, do you have any family in the UP? (Gil sobs) - [Gil] Don't cry, Gil. Don't you dare cry. Pick that lip up. God, help me get through this and I swear. [Gil's Father] Careful now, Harold don't swear any promises you can't keep. Dad, is that you? I didn't say that. I thought that. You're in my head. Well, trauma psychosis, I'm in your head. What're you doing there? You tell me what I'm doing here. I don't know why you're here, but while you're here, I will tell you, I did not mean to kill you. I mean, I did mean for you to break a leg or something like that, but... I know, still it was a pretty Damien move. I guess, yeah. (knocking on car) Come join me, son. A visit. Everything depends on it. (train horn honks) (fire crackling) (solemn music) Is that? When your mother left me, something inside me just died. You deserved so much more, Harold. I just didn't have it to give. I am so very sorry. There's no way that I killed that girl. (fire crackling) (engine roaring) (bat patrons chattering) [Bar Patron] You hit 'er pretty hard, didn't ya? (men laughing) - Hey. - What'll you have, my friend? [Gil] Do you still got that burger and beer special? Yes, we do. Medium rare and whatever beer comes with it. [Bartender] Get me the special, medium rare. (door creaks) [Gil] Changed a few things up. ♪ The funny thing about having friends ♪ ♪ They're never around when ♪ Either you got a sack the size of swamp tires, buddy or you are as stupid as you look. Now, is that there supposed to be some kind of compliment or insult? What you want, Ike? What you want? (fist thuds) (men yelling) Now, the stories of people actually getting their eye punched out is like urban myth, kind of like Bruce Lee pulling out someone's heart, but in my case... Yeah! (glass shatters) [Gil] Oh, my eye. I'mma need another beer and put it on Ike Gilles' tab! Matter of fact, (coughs) do a round for the bar and put it on Ike Gilles' tab. (bar patrons cheer) [Bartender] You heard him, put it on his tab. ♪ Yeehaw, I love you all ♪ (door creaking) [Gil] That Ike is gonna get it for knocking my eye. Wait till I catch up. Whoa, whoa.

(Ike yells) Is that Gil? [Ike] My idiot cousin. I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna kill. You're a Gilles, aren't you? [Ike] Who wants to know? Gil killed my sister. We're gonna get him. We want your help. (dramatic music) Hey, guess who? (frames whooshing) Do you know out of all the trucks that I could have acquired, guess whose truck I got? Parp's narps, you stole my truck, buddy! Oh, that's not all I stole. This here knife sure is a beaut. My momma gave me that knife, Gil. Oh, and this cherry pie kush, absolutely delightful. Okay. Game respects game. Let's just say we're even on the rides, but you still got an ass whoopin' coming, buddy. What are you talking about coming? You knocked out my eye, you nitwit ogre. And what are you talking about even on rides? My new race car is totally badass. You dropped your keys when you left your eyeball, Gil. Ike, if you take my car I just might have to kill you. What would that bring your number to? What, like three? You've been racking up some kills I don't know nothing about, buddy. Eat crap, Ike and I'm talking about double servings, double servings of eating crap on you. You eat crap. Crap. (crickets chirping) [Gil] Last time I was here I was about 14. (owl hoots) Ike and I had been busting into troll cottages when the law got wise. Before that I had hung here a month after my dad caught me stealing from him and threatened to beat me to death. (dark music) I wasted my time, a haze of alcoholic rage and depression. (Gil's dad sighs) I could have been had a teacher for you, son. And I caused you to drop outta school and (sighs) didn't give you the tools you needed in order to succeed in life. It's all so clear now. You gotta start seeing your truth, boy. Come on, let me make it up to you. I don't know about that. [Gil's Father] Come on, Gil. (Gil groaning) (Sylvia moaning) [Sylvia] It didn't have to be this way. Sylvia? Sylvia. - She can't hear you. - My baby didn't have to be dead. What, is all this in my head again? [Sylvia] (sobs) No. Is it? There you go again. (Sylvia gasps) It's all his fault. She, she saying it's my fault? I did it? I told him to leave her alone. (sobs) I love you, baby. I'm sorry, I, I'm so sorry, I hear you. Now my baby's dead. (dramatic music) This is a taste of truth, son. Make you wiser than any whiskey or beer ever will. Those two girls always had it in for me. Those two girls only ever had each other. Bond of love born in heaven that they carried into this hard life they were living. [Peggy] Julie, I'm sorry. (crickets chirping) (Gil snoring) (bear puffing) (bear roaring) I still feel that connection to my sister. I feel her presence with me, even now here, but it's, it's different. Yeah, dead'll make things different. What, buddy? Come on, man. Life doesn't give participation awards or trophies. There's winners and then there's losers. Yeah and obviously you're a- - I'm a what? - Whoa, come on. Oh, let her finish. I'm a what? Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, let her finish. What? Stop. Stop. Obviously we're pretty tired, so- I'm not- I say, I say we down these eggs and we go and find Gil. Can we please do that, please? Yeah. [Jim] Great. Yeah. All right. Geeze. (bear roaring) (leaves rustling) No. (dramatic music) (Gil whimpering) (Gil panting) God, how did I get here? I'm just trying to get by in life. (bear roars) You need to tell me, did I kill that girl? (branch snaps) (Gil yells) (Gil thuds) (Gil groans) (Gil pants) (bear growling) (dramatic music) (birds tweeting) (Ike chuckles) Keys. [Jim] You leaving us already? I don't like Gil one bit, buddy. Business from as kids. We only had one another growing up and then there was Shirley and then I knocked his eye out. Kind of feel like I owe him some change on that one. Then he took my truck without asking, but then I got my truck back. This here place is Gil's hide out. He knows this area better than most. He's probably got a stash of guns. And like Obi-Wan, he's got the high ground. And lastly, Gil grew up immortalizing Rambo. So no, I think we're done here. [Gil] Facing the law and justice is one thing, but these three would likely kill me if they could. Best place to set a trap for old Gil is at the local bar. If you need anything call me. (car engine roars) I think him leaving might be for the best. What did you bring for protection? [Jim] Got a knife. [Peggy] A knife? This is Gil we're going after. I don't like guns. When I was a kid, my brother hurt me pretty bad with a BB gun. I mean, he didn't shoot me or anything, he just hit me over the head with it. What'd you bring? [Peggy] Gil! We're coming for you. (dramatic music) (tense music) (Gil grunting) (Gil groans) (Gil panting) (gentle music) [Gil's Father] Hey, Harold. Dad? Again? Am I dying? No. Uh, yeah. Well, I mean, all things born die. That's the circle of existence. But there is a place of rest outside the pains of life. It's not your time yet, son. Allow me to, once again show you where your actions have put other events into motion. (Sylvia humming solemnly) I can't stand to watch her like this. I Never felt this much guilt before in my entire life, not even when I killed you. (dark music) The tormentor becomes a tormented without redemption and that's like drinking poison and expecting another person to die. Lies are a slow poison. How much one can endure alone varies. The human spirit needs compassion, forgiveness, kindness, and love to survive. Without it, their spirit to live will surely die. (Ike laughing) Ike, you can't do it, you old oaf. You're the only family I got. (Ike laughs) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (Gil groans) Shut your mouth! (engines roaring) (music lulls) (solemn music) (engine humming) Yeah, Mary. We're up here in the middle of nowhere. I mean, we gotta get this guy back there. (sighs) What do you mean? Who did it? You gotta be kidding me. (Calvin breathes heavily) What'd they say? (Calvin sighs) Sylvia did it. What? She killed her own daughter. (gasps) I didn't kill her. S, Sylvia killed her? (Gil breathes deep) Had that call come just an hour later I would've been a fugitive on the run again, but I just can't believe that my beloved Sylvia killed her own daughter. I ended up getting a few years probation and mandatory AA, which I started attending with my Sylvia at her hospital. Together, we were relearning how to live without the drinking. (bright music) (emotive music) (soaring music) She had a long journey to travel, but at least she had taken those important first few steps. (material scuffing) (item clatters) (car engine humming) (car door thuds) (item thuds) (door creaks) 'Sup, Gil? Okay, come in. (feet thudding) (Gil sighs) (cloth rustling) (cardboard rustling) (bottle hisses open) (glasses click) (Ike sighs) (Ike burps) (both laughing) (keys rattle) [Gil] I kept my promise to make good with Ike.
