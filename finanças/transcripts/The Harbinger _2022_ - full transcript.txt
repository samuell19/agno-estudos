You have the key. What the fuck are you waiting for? Would you move back just six feet? No. My God! If you're in the hallway, would you wear a mask? I have lived for 22 years in this building. It's my home, you're not gonna tell me... The hallway is a public space! This is my building, my oxygen. Don't tell me what to do! Fuck! Do you see what I have to put up every fucking night? Mavis! - It's Jason. - Christ almighty! I'm coming in. Mavis? Mavis! Can you hear me? Jesus, are you asleep? Mavis? Are you asl... I'm not ready to be forgotten. It's me. It's Jason. I'm not... It's okay, it's okay, it's okay! Somebody get you up here? Yeah. You know who. I'm sorry, Jason. Shit. Look, why don't you let me get you something for that? No, it's fine, it's... It's not deep. Uh... I don't know what's happening to me. You have anyone you can call? Like, family, or... They're on lockdown all the way in Seattle. They couldn't get here if they did care. But there's gotta be someone. What am I, five? We had to do something. Hey. Why's it smell like a damn carnival in here? Oh, neighbor kid went by with some kettle corn. I just opened the window to let in some fresh... Oh. That's fine too. Kettle corn's a lie, anyway. I can't not ask you what you mean by that. It's like the number one thing that smells better than it tastes. All right. Lyle's back. Oh, that was quick. Home, motherfuckers. You got frozen dried fruits and veggies. Three more are on the way. - How was it? - It was good. Didn't have to get out the car. Ordered over the phone, prepaid, dude came out, mask, gloves, whole deal. I popped the trunk, he loaded 'em in. - That was it? - That was it. You know what else smells better than it tastes? - Hm? - Street sausage. Agree. - What? - Nothing, just... you reminded me of Lyle's sausage incident last fall. Do you actually not know? - Know what? - The sausage-cart story. - Oh. - What is it, what is it? It's only my actual favorite thing that's ever happened. - Do we have to? - Okay, so last fall... - I guess we have to. - We were downtown, back when we did things, wandering around this farmers' market. So we're about to leave when we smell it. Street sausage. They smell a lot better than they taste. We literally just said that. But he has to have one anyway. Of course I do. I'm like, "Aww, shit, I only got a 50," and the street vendor dude's got no change, right? But the guy tells Lyle that it's okay, he only lives a block away, so he'll go home and make change if we watch the cart. So we're, like, fine, and then off he goes, - we're waiting. - Waiting, waiting, waiting, and then, my well-coordinated brother here... I... I lean against the cart, you know, like barely. My foot slips and it kicks out the wheel-stopper thing. - Oh no. - Oh no is right, 'cause next thing we know, this motherfucker's rolling... like sausages on the move. Downhill, fast, like, goes over an intersection. My whole memory of this is in slow motion. We're just chasing after like, "No!" And this thing hits a curb and then it's like... Oh, shit! Hold up. - Is that the cake? - It's what they gave me. - "Gluten free"? - Hey, hey, I'll live. Airborne sausage cart? Right, right, right. So it pops into a fence, like, tips over it, and guess what's on the other side? - What? - Dog park. - Oh no! - Dog park! Bedlam! - Sausages everywhere. - Hundreds of dogs just go berserk. Like, the owners are just helpless, like gettin' dog-trampled, caught up in the fray. I bought so many sausages that day. I didn't get to eat one, but it's all right. At least we, uh, got to feed these... Oh, that's mine. - Do you mind? - Yeah, sure. Mo... Monique's phone. Old friend, she says. Mavis? Whoa. Um... okay, I'll take it. One sec. - Stupid! - What is wrong with you? Hello? - Happy birthday to... - Oh, Jesus. Never mind with the bonfires. Skip to the end before we burn the house down. Okay. Well, come on, help me. We all have the same damn wish, huh? - There we go. - Whoo! - Mm, gritty. - It's what they had. Thank you both. This is lovely, really. And what you've done coming here, giving up your lives. Our lives were sorta canceled, you know. Well, you didn't have to. I'm glad you did, though. 'Cause without you, I'd probably be huffin' on a ventilator at Binghamton General by now. - Real dark, Dad. - And I know your mother's here. So happy birthday to me, I guess. And a blessing on our family. - Amen. - Cheers. I'm thinking of going into the city for a couple days. I have a friend in Queens who's in real trouble. I'll be careful, I'll wear a mask. - Hold up, who, who? - I'll keep my distance. Mavis. You don't... we were roommates at Pratt back when I was going through - everything. - You literally haven't, like, physically left this house. Suddenly, you wanna go into goddamned ground zero. - I made a promise, I can't... - Promises are canceled along with everything else. - She said it's life or death. - So is everything right now, so is this, what we're doing here. Yeah, it's also a lot of Yahtzee and day drinking, so... But that's not your decision to make. Whatever you pick up along the way, you'll be bringing back here. We've worked hard for this bubble. I just think it's really shitty what you're doing. I really do. Okay. Dad? You're not saying anything. You're my sparrow. You're my hope. You understand? It's what you were to her, it's what you are to me. I need you here. Please stay. Mornin'. I just wanted my goodbye before you weasel on out. Oh, you were leavin' before you said one word. I know you. You know, any asshole sneezes on you or anywhere near you... I'll have to quarantine when I get back, I know. - Fourteen days. - I don't want that either. Dad'll be okay, I'll talk to him. All right? No need for whatever note you got. Not exactly a note. I forget how good you are. Got it. Yeah, no problem. Okay. Hey, who... who let you in? I don't see any deliveries. I'm... I'm a friend of Mavis's. - Why? - Why? Because I live here and I like to know who's in my building, especially if you're friends with... Oh! Six feet, please. Don't tell me what to do in my own building! It's not me telling you. These fuckin' idiot sheeple! You came. I did, crazily. I don't know if you can tell through my mask, but I'm smiling. Same. Do you, uh... You sure it's okay? I'm sure if you're sure. It's real good to see you. - Or sort of see you. - Yeah! You too, but, um, sorry, I actually really, really need to pee, so... Oh my God, of course. I've been holding it in 'cause I didn't wanna gamble with the rest stops with everything that's... Yeah, of course, go ahead. It's right around the corner here. I'll be super careful, I've got alcohol wipes. I trust you... yeah. I was hoping you were still at it. Oh, yeah, barely. I wish I could really see you. I haven't been anywhere in, like, months. - Not even a grocery store? - Deliveries for, like, - fruit and veggies and TP... - Same. We've all been super careful. No doctors, no repairmen. The building manager came in once, but he's so careful. - I trust you. - I trust you, too. Are we really doing this? I think we're doing this, yeah. Does this mean that we can, like... Sorry! It's just been a really long time since I've touched anyone. It's like we're normal human beings or something! - It's really fucking important. - It is. Um, can we do it again? Ooh, hello. - Oh my God! - What? Oh yeah, that roller coaster. - Remember that? - Of course. I was so afraid I was gonna vomit on you. Do you wanna keep that? Really? Sure. That's the little boy who lives upstairs. Oh. I think I saw him earlier. He didn't look good. Kids can't get it, can they? I mean, I think they mostly don't, - but they definitely can. - I'm so sorry. Should I have said something to you about that? - I didn't... - No, no, no, I'm sure it's fine. Yeah. Hi. Thank you for coming. You saved my life. That was a really long time ago. I was in a dark fucking place. I was done trying. I had a day circled. Then when you dropped me off at St. Jude's, I... wanted to fucking strangle you. I think you tried. But then I had help. I had tools. I had something to call it. So I meant it when I said I would come if you ever needed me. I just... I never thought you would. Tell me what the hell's going on. Bad dreams. Sounds stupid, right? - I didn't say anything. - But, look, I'm not six. I have bad dreams and I shake 'em off like a grown-ass person, I don't want you to think - that that's... - Don't worry about what I think. Tell me about them. Usually, they take place here, or someplace familiar. It's like any dream. There's some part of me that's outside of myself. I can move around, but something else is making my choices. I-I-I go into rooms that I know I shouldn't go into. But, like I said, I can shake 'em off. It's just, lately, it's the waking-up part that's gotten hard. What do you mean? I mean I don't wake up. Whatever internal clock or noise or thirst or whatever's supposed to happen just doesn't. I set alarms. Eight of 'em. Useless. Pinch myself. Nothing. Fucking gouging myself worked for a while; now I just bleed. One time, I was in a dream for days, and I walked and walked until I got to this cliff, and it's really actually beautiful. But then I... I get the bad feeling. I know that he's there. - Who? - Him. The one who's behind it. It's like you just sense that he's there. So, finally, I'm just like, "Fuck this. I'm jumping off the cliff," like, right? Like, "I'm dreaming, I'm calling your bluff." And I jump, I'm falling, and I get that... That pit in my stomach. The ground is rushing up. And that's the point where usually... - You wake up. - But I don't. Instead, I... I crash into the rocks. I feel myself come apart. I'm just this smashed mess, and-and-and I still don't wake up. I just exist like that for hours. And then, when I finally do wake up... it's like I'm... I'm alive, I'm okay... except for, of course, I'm not fucking okay, because I can't pull my shit together. I'm losing clients, I'm losing friends. I mean, to be honest, this pandemic is just like the cherry on the shit sundae, because even when I can manage to wake up, I'm still in a fucking nightmare! I mean, we all are. When you're stuck in there, do you ever get, like, hungry or tired? No. In fact, that's the only way I know I'm dreaming. - I can't fall asleep. - You're already asleep. Right. I tried that. I thought maybe that could be a way to get out. Maybe that would be a way to die, to just fall asleep in your dream. And to think that sounded okay... you know? I know. But it's not. It doesn't matter. Because someday soon, I just won't wake up. ([Monique) Come on, that's not gonna happen. It will happen. That's what he said to me. Last night, he got closer than he ever has. He said it's almost time. He said soon I'll be gone. And not just gone, forgotten too. You want me out here? Yeah, I figured you'd want some space. - I can stay up with you, if... - No, I... I'm going to sleep. - Aren't you... - Fucking terrified? Yep. That's just my baseline. I don't know, maybe I'll get lucky. It's not every night that it happens. But, I mean, if I don't sleep, I'll just get crazy and fuzzy and then I'll end up passing out anyways, - and that's much worse. - All right, so, I'll go to sleep with you, then. I'm... I could pee, I could bleed. I don't care. Wouldn't it help just to know you're not alone? You first. It shouldn't take long. Go on, sparrow, it's okay. I'm right behind you. - Mom? - Right here, baby. Pretty, huh? So pretty. But are you sure you still know where... - Mom? - I'm here. Don't worry. Where? I can't see you. Out here! Mom? How are you doing that? You... you sound like you're right here. I'm not your mother. Please don't hurt me. Shit. Oh my God. Lyle. Hey, hey, I'm sorry, I seen you were up, so... No, no, I'm sorry I never... - Where's your mask? - I'm... we're not wearing them. No, no, no, no, it's cool. She's been really careful, like us, and... Dad spiked a fever. - When? - Last night. - Fuck. - Yep. - How bad? - Bad. 102.8. But I... how? I mean... Somethin' got through, okay? Hopefully, it's not that somethin'. I'm scared, okay? I just need you to come... What was that? Uh, I'm sorry, someone's in trouble here. I'm gonna have to call you back. Uh, tell Dad I... Dammit! Mavis! Mavis! That's the sound of his voice. He says he's happy to meet you. - Hey. - Finally! Uh, hey, is Dad okay? Oh, he's pissed. But that's just, you know... He's not sick? Sick? No. Just... just checking. He is still making that sound, you know, when he breathes. That's another story. So how is everything over there, everything all right? It's complicated. Tell me later. I just wanted to make sure you were alive. Be careful, Mo. I will, I promise. Okay. I'll see you later. - Bye. - Buh-bye. No! Okay, okay, okay, you're awake. Okay. You're awake. Okay. I'm here, I'm here, I'm here. Okay, okay, okay. Thank you. Well, at least you look great. Was it just one night? Mm-hm. How long was it in the dream? I... I don't wanna talk about it. Not to pile on, but... - Oh, fuck. - Yeah, I mean, not awesome. Oh, n... I-I don't know what to do. I'm so sorry, Mo. - I-I-I had no idea. - Of course you didn't. I mean, like, what does this mean for you? I mean, I was probably already gonna have to quarantine when I got back. - I shouldn't have called. - It's fine. How did you sleep? Um, so-so. - Did I keep you up? - No. Did you dream? - Oh, Jesus! - I'm fine. I'm really susceptible to bad dreams when I get freaked out. - And I freaked you out. - You did. Definitely. So, it doesn't mean anything. Okay. We have work to do. - We do? - Mm-hm. I made a list of doctors. They all do telehealth, they're sorted by positive feedback. - I didn't know your insurance... - Just stop. Pretend like you believe me. - What do you mean? - Pretend like you really believe me about what this is and what this isn't. Okay? Now how would you help? So. This person you keep seeing in your dreams, can you tell me what he looks like? - We post this where, again? - Reddit, Hivemind. If this is a real thing, then who's to say someone else out there isn't going through it too? Wanna take a look? You know what this is, right? No. What is it? - Plague doctor. - Right. It says they used to put flowers and herbs and things in the beak part so they couldn't smell the rot. That's right downstairs. - Hey, what's going on? - It's Mrs. Slater's little boy. I saw him come out. They put a sheet over his head like they weren't in any fuckin' hurry, you know? They told our kids they're supposed to be okay. Crystal? You all right? We have extra masks. Do you want one? Mom? You get scared? Get in, sparrow. What are you afraid of? Forgetting. You forget what it was? No. That's what scared me. Forgetting. I need to remember everything that happens. You do? Yes. But I don't. I-I can't. I couldn't remember Nana's face. You miss her, huh? Yes. I tried to picture her in my head, but... I understand. But look there. There she is. There's your Nana. That's why we have photos. They help us remember. When I die like Nana, will you forget my face? You aren't going anywhere until the end of your long, long life. Nothing is gonna hurt you here. What about him? Oh. Him. - Don't... - Stop! No! Don't! Stop, Mommy! Stop! Hello? Is somebody... Help! Please! Stop... Stop! I'll help you wake up. Mavis? Mavis, wake up. Mavis? Oh my God. Shh, shh, shh! Oh, okay, I'm right here. I'm sorry! Are... are you okay? What time is it? 2:30. Fuck. Mavis? It's happening to me too. I saw him. Two nights in a row. So I fucked us both? I'm not ready to believe that. I've been going through responses to our post. - We got responses? - We sure did. But most of 'em are, you know, well, the internet. - So, nothing yet? - Um... I did schedule us a video chat with a demonologist. So... there's that. Um... - Hey, kids! - Oh my God, guys. Guys, guys, guys, guys, come on, come on, come on, off. So, so sorry, um... you must be, um... -Monique -Mavis. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. Come on, stop it, I... Jesus. Um, okay, uh, I'm Wendy, and this is my new normal, sorry. - Yeah, no problem. - No worries. Uh, I do have to just ask, like, if and when the conversation gets dark, uh, maybe just keep our tone light? - Sure. - Of course. Uh, honey... I-I-I read your post but I couldn't see the sketch. My virus protection thingy wouldn't open the JPEG attachment, so... - I've got it here. - But you said it was distinct from the classic plague doctor image in a few ways? Put that away! Wait, why? - There's lot of pictures of... - No. Not like that one. If... if you put that out there with your post and your story, it plants a seed and fear, which grows the seed, and that's exactly how he works, how he gets inside. But he hit me, Mommy, I'm busted. Fuck it. - Screen time! - Yay! Delete the post, burn that sketch, or the call's over. What, now? Um, so, you say that's how he works. Um, you think we're dealing with some kind of... Demon, yeah. Sorry, I don't have a less crazy word. I get it. I didn't go into this field thinking anything was real, no one does, especially an off-the-record, unpublished myth like this. Everyone says they don't believe, but then they're so superstitious, they won't even talk about it, won't even call it by its name. There's a name for it? Why that? Passed down. There are other names in other places. It's a bad omen, right? If you got sick a long time ago and you saw that, it meant... Maybe it is that, but I think it's more like, if you see this thing is in the world, it's a signal of something... bigger, something even worse. - Awesome. - Why does he look like that? It's the form he chooses, maybe to amuse himself. He likes the pandemic. That's what I think. We're isolated, that's how he likes us, how he gets in. - In? - Your head. Look... okay, um, what this thing really is at its core is a bad idea. Once you have it, you can't un-have it. It gets lodged in. It hijacks your dreams. It plays every part. And if you're a bad idea that wants to spread, this world we're in right now is paradise. So, when he gets in there, then what happens? He wears you down, breaks your will, burrows in further. Till it's strong enough to take you. Did he say that to you? It's true, isn't it? Wh... what do you mean, "take you"? Like... like, kill you? Hard to tell. There are no bodies, no search parties, because it's like you were never there at all. - You mean... - All traces, all records. All your stuff, all the memories of you, all the things you changed in the world... gone, like you were never born. I know, it's a lot. Wait, so then how are you gathering information? The people I usually talk to have found evidence of someone who never existed. However he does it, however he takes people, the process isn't perfect. Things are left behind. Little relics, pictures sometimes. And I'm sure I've talked to people, like you two, ones who really see him. But I can't remember them anymore. Do you understand? So then, why are you still here? I mean, with all this digging, doesn't that put you at risk and your kids? - Yes. - So, don't you ever think about that? I won't sit here knowing what I know while he takes more people, while he punches holes in the world, 'cause then what's left for my kids anyway? So, what are we supposed to do? This. Stop him spreading. Make it so no one remembers him. That's how a bad idea dies. No, what are we supposed to do? I don't know. So how did you expect to help? I didn't. I can't help you. I'm trying to help everyone else. This isn't the kind of thing you just beat. You maybe beat it back until... - Hey, hey, bud... - Are you serious? - Hey, hey, your tone? - Fuck my tone! You believe her? It matches what he said. He'll hollow me out, and he has. - Come on. - He has, Mo. If he was able to do it that fast with just a couple of bad dreams, then... it means I was already probably pretty easy to forget. Not for me, you aren't. I've tried. So if she's somehow right, then it means you didn't just pull this out of thin air. Somebody planted the seed. That's what I keep thinking about. The fog in my mind, the... the empty spaces, I can't... Do you know what I think? I think somebody was here. There's, um, there's a smell sometimes. Like a... cologne. Like a ghost. I think somebody was here. And I think... I think... holy shit. I think I have a picture of them. It's like she said, uh, things that are left behind. Relics. Okay, so, when I got this set back, there was this photo here that I didn't take. And I remember at the time, it blew my mind, but there just was so much else going on, I... - Do you know him? - No. That's your room. Wait, for real, you've never seen him? No! And I never let anyone else use this camera. Look at his eyes. See how he's looking at me? I had someone in my life. He loved me. And I probably loved him. And now where is he? Gone. Nowhere. He never even was. This is so cruel. You shouldn't have come back here. I didn't know where else to go. - You were exposed! - I don't know that for sure. You were in the building when that boy... I know, but that doesn't mean... If there... if there was anywhere else I could've gone, I would've. All right, we talked about it, okay, and if you're willing to isolate yourself in the back bedroom for 14 days, use only the guest bathroom, wipe it down every single time you use it, I mean it... I get it, I get it, I totally get it. That... that's great. I just... - Thank you. - Sit. We already have to disinfect everything... so you might as well eat before you're banished. I'm sure you're hungry. Did you at least do what you went up there to do? No. I did the opposite. I abandoned her in her worst moment. I just... I couldn't. Mo... your mask. Oh, God. I am so sorry. I don't... I don't know where it... No, what the fuck? Come on! I'll go up, stop it! Lyle, I'll go up by myself! - What are you doing? - Get her up there! - What the fuck? - Go! - Stop! - Go! You get scared? Let me the fuck out! Let me out! Please! Help me, please! It's okay. How... how are you here? I haven't all the way left yet. And... I could see him. The man with the bird head. He wanted to take me too. But I got the germs that only grownups are supposed to get. That took me first. What do you want with me? The lady you talked to is wrong. There is a way to stop him. Show me the place you sleep. You know what to do, don't you? I think so. He's coming. Don't move. He's not here for you. We have to do something. We can't. We're in the dream. But they aren't? No, that's really happening. He got strong enough to come through. I don't want to look. - Mavis! - Don't. - Wake up! Please, wake up! - It won't help. Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Please, wake up! Wake u... Hey. You're trespassing. - Who are you? - More like who are you, but okay, hi, I'm Jason, the building manager. What? All right, look, the apartment's not rented. It's private property, you can't squat. For fuck's sake. Are you on some kind of bender or something? Hey, look, I don't want the cops here, and I'm sure you don't either, so call who you need to call, all right, and then you gotta get out. Jesus Christ! - I know, I'm sorry. - Where have you been? We've been fuckin' lookin' everywhere, callin' fuckin' everybody. In the city, I'm in the city. What? How the hell did you... Your car is still here. - We've been freakin' out... - I know it's fucked up, but I woke up in a strange apartment, and... I don't remember what happened, I don't remember how I got here. You're off your meds. Yeah, but... this is different. I'll come and get you, but it's gotta be after work. Text me the address. Aren't you cold? I didn't even notice. - Was it still the bad dreams? - Lyle, I don't... You said they've gotten worse, that you met somebody online. - Forget it. - Some demonologist. - Forget it. - Mo, what the fuck is goin' on? I said, forget it! Feels like I've been worried about you for forever. I'm sorry for that. You still gettin' that teaching degree when all this blows over? Maybe, I don't know. Do it. Don't wait. Don't wait on anything anymore. And keep Dad close. - Why are you talkin' like that? - It's not what you think. - Well, I don't like it. - It's not what you think. Just try and survive all this dark shit we're in. Might get worse before it gets better. You know what to do, don't you? Who were you? Mavis. [dark, brooding music[ Please. I have a family. I have people who need me. You have no family. You were never born. Just like you always wanted. And you were right. It's better this way. I was hoping it would be you here. I'm happy to see you. I'm happy to see you too. Can I come in? You did it. What's your name? Edward. I'm Monique. You can call me Mo. Thank you, Edward. You're welcome, Mo. Ready to wake up? - I didn't know I could. - Yes. But not here. I'll show you where. Come on. Go on. What happens now? Just close your eyes. Where will you go? Maybe I'll just be gone. I won't forget you. Dad! Dad, come here, she's awake! So I'm like, "Excuse me, three days is not exactly normal to just be asleep. - And they didn't budge. - They're like, "Sorry, there's literally no room in the hospital for anybody still breathing." And we kept badgering them till finally they sent out a doc. Dude comes out in this Hazmat suit. Big-ass Hazmat suit, I shit you not, it was crazy. He started giving you, like, fluids and stuff. Gave you one of those rapid tests. So, wait... our masks. That's what we're tellin' you, see? We all got tested. And we're... Negative. All three of us. - Hey. - Hey. - Frozen. - Uh-huh. - There's eggs, dairy. - Yeah, yeah, I got it, I got it. We don't have to bleach the strawberries. I can't hear you. It's a madhouse in here. I'm taking you someplace quieter. Dad, Lyle's right, don't bleach everything. - I'm dizzy all the time. - All right! So sorry, I've almost escaped. Here. Just one second. - Sorry. - It's okay, no worries. - Much better. - So, you were saying, three whole nights. Three nights of peace. - Nice, normal dreams. - That's fantastic. The first morning I woke up and I realized I wasn't still stuck in a dream... I can't even, I mean... I cried. I was so relieved. And you really feel okay? I mean, I still feel a bit strange. Like, I keep on running up against these... blanks in my mind. You still don't have any idea who introduced you to him. - That's true. - But you said in your email, you found a possible relic? Maybe. Can you see this? Sort of, yeah. Hold still. I know that's me on the left. The other girl... I don't know her, and I don't remember going to this place. I cleaned out this bag last week, so, I don't know, maybe... it somehow got in when I was away. Hold onto it. Chances are there was someone. I don't wanna think about it. Something's off with you. I thought you'd be, like, ecstatic. It's just, um... How did you know what to do? Who told you? There was a boy, an angel. I know that sounds... But he told me what to do. He led me out. - Out of? - Out of the dream. But you know that he's everyone in your dream. This was different. - How? - This boy saved me. But the dreams and everyone in them are a tool, remember? - To get close and get out. - Stop it! I'm not ready to be for... Sir? Can you hear me? I said, can you hear me? Your neighbors heard a commotion, said it might've been from here. You know what that was all about? - What's your name? - Lyle Cartwright. You live at this residence? I grew up here, but I'm only back temporarily. Who lives here with you? My dad, but he's not here right now. He's at Binghamton General. He got sick last week. Anybody else around? Brothers, sisters? No, I don't have any, it's just me. Your dad's gonna be okay? Yeah, he is. They just took him off a ventilator. They're bringin' him home tomorrow. Good to hear. - Have a good day. - You too. You did it. Did what? You said you wasn't gonna get that tube outta your mouth, you said you wouldn't be back here again. Here you are. Here I am. You don't seem happy. Maybe if the world I was comin' back to wasn't so... One thing at a time, old man. It's just all the damage, all the... empty spaces. It'll be back, okay? They're lifting restrictions. No, it's more than that. A shadow's falling over. And you can pretend like you don't feel it, but I know you do. Everybody does. And there's worse things comin'. You gotta keep up hope. - Why? - 'Cause that's what we do. We do? We do. You sound like your mother. Good. I'm goin' to bed.
