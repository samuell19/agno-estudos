Read all about it! Exploding people! Buy the paper! This overcrowded city has recently become - the scene of a series of mysterious murders... As if people had totally lost their minds - and were competing in killing each other This was the starting-point of it all and my part in it - was to turn into something I had never even dreamed about This is me, Lipton Cockton My original Ugrian name was Launo Käkkyrä And this is my Gamecock A few months ago I got an urgent call to inspect - the scene of the latest mass murder Lipton Cockton! Good that you came Cockton! They closed the whole area... Took all the evidence... They claim our authority is terminated... That we will be transferred... Do something! You are one of the best... Remember that you are one of us... Splendid You rush in here... You don't even respect the dead You are dismissed. Leave everything untouched We are the police of northern precinct. I am the officer in charge He is Lipton Cockton, the detective I am Brand Marlon from the Federal Police The case is our business from now on. And you Madame... - What? You are from this very moment at my very personal service And be assured... that it will be comfortable I knew it... A darkie slut... No! You have no right! This is our territory! Lipton Cockton... A personal name and an expeditious attitude Here's some evidence for you All that was left of it You're acting under the Federal Police And take orders directly from me! Remember, that your first case for us may also be your last I won't take you under my protection without compensation... I also demand sacrifices! - What do you mean? Unbutton your trousers! You are mistaken about me I never make mistakes Pants down! Only over this and my mother's dead body You have no sense of humour... Start the investigation I expect reports on an hourly basis! February 14th Valentine's Day. The same scene again: A weird superintendent and a psycho - who has invented an effective way of exterminating people For me, it was only one in a whole load of similar cases - during these endless last months A pickpocket, I presume... Pedophile! - Whadda fuck d'ya think you're doin! In an extremely exhausted mood I sometimes adopt over-violent methods ...as a consequence of too long a time - without sleep and regular human relationships Tonight, despite my orders from top-superiors - I decided to make my long time dream a reality You're on a thief-hunt again? Many victims under your mighty member? Half a bottle and a mouth spray A half? 50 good to have you in the 'hood The shop hasn't been robbed since you moved You clean up this city like a puss-fucking maggot! Have I told you about this mouth spray? Manufactured by a diversified company “LTD Productions - In The Victorious Way To The Future!" An institution that owns and sells everything that improves life! Oh... are you leaving? Happy Valentine's Day! 3.30 AM. On my way home Seemed like I was a celebrity in my area So I decided to make the Day of Friendship a feast Mr Cockton! I recognized your heavy steps Fuck your pet to death, moron... - Ass-wipe! Filthy animal! You don't even respect the handicapped! Good old Adolf Kekäläinen had maintained his spunky Ugrian humour Goddammit! You're ahead of time! No, no... This is well within the agreed schedule As a freelancer these days you gotta bust your ass to make ends meet OK! Spit it out! Calm yourself! You aren't delivering what I ordered! A thrilling performance isn't guaranteed. Only an adequate one I need these thrills! Not just adequate! And nothing perverse! Before making any further complaints... Think, that even behind this card there may be an emotional human being! Wait! You also have a package in the mail! Video stuff. Top secret... - What! It's porno! Of course; look at this guy! Under no circumstances was this fuck-face the professional - I had requested from the Mail Order My innocent plan to spend the night with a paid companion- went sour as those who took my order - was totally indifferent to my discreet demands So, I was left with no choice but to spend an ordinary evening at home Fucking rascal! Now hear this my beloved son. This is your mother speaking These are probably my last words to you when you hear this... I'll already be gone Because you have ruined my life! You just fuck sluts of all tribes Instead of bringing glory to our clan - The Cocktons! Now I leave you this, - my humble and simple message to remind you of the woman - who sacrificed her life for her son where are you? You don't visit your mother anymore! If you don't come at once... then don't attend the funeral either! I know that you too have problems with yourself You are just as miserable in your solitude - as any living creature in the middle of all this madness If you desire information regarding your latest mission Well, you know your way to Silicon Café Hi barkeep! I am Lipton Cockton. Any message for me? No message for you Wait! A woman was sorry she had to leave... She left some information: There is a message for you, at the Federal Network Bureau The code word is “Lonely“ where is the host? Here is a Gamecock I'll take a whore... what do you want? You need fresh meat! And I need a woman! You eat shit! - Eat your own! This is fed on the best! The most handsome cock in the village! And I'm the best! I fuck them to pieces! You don't get a cock-burger out of this! Cock-shit! Burger with jerky cock lasts! - For this you barely get Irma... Irma! I just got rid of one like that! Pretzels are included... - Shit, I'm being fucked all over again Irma, that dull piece of duckling She could die if I humped her! Shit, I'll crush you Irma... -Just a moment! I think we're giving the bird another chance See, the animals... and the women they constitute the salvation - of this planet You cannot exploit them as you please We're out of here. Have fun guys... I withdrew in a seemingly calm mood - hoping that my spontaneous outburst wasn't too noticeable in the bar I don't know what had provoked me - but that strange incident made me almost forget my actual mission, - this mysterious caller who might be my devious murderer... Something had moved inside me and I felt a strange sympathy; Me and my sudden Valentine Day partner By the way, where are you going? Actually, you can stay also... Just don't you shit on my coat Rather surprising, I was expecting to make music in a totally different way But this is better... A friend beats a slut any day! Fucking son of a bitch! No reports! We arrive in this office expecting some information! But, no... There is a message for me... on, Mr Cockton! All kinds of confusions! Unpaid bills... this and that... These machines make too many mistakes - as if I could afford it! Start coding my fucking transfers... Well, I am a man and I am a woman But only one at a time! So, now you know it too! Hope to meet you again soon... A message... coded "Lonely" We are only extras in our own drama Nobody wants to be in charge to take any actual responsibility Things just happen to us You know that you protect a lifestyle which only promotes premature death Anyhow, you don't do the opposite! You are a typical product of this time. A guardian of self imposed immunity But your immunity will not save you from the next humiliation I'd also like to ask you a question: Did you know, that the common people have to volunteer - for the most of their lives as guinea pigs for the corporate world? I'll give you a clue in order for you to understand - how it is to live in the world you've committed yourself to defend! “LTD Productions - In The Victorious Way To The Future!" And do remember...The final solution is always at hand Let it be proven, in front of your own eyes Explain yourself! What were you doing in there? I have found out that all the victims were decent middle class B3 citizens And by that you mean? Normal victims of the system acting just as they are expected to So there is some crazy dissident... responsible for all this An alienated mutant who is dedicated to - blowing up common people, puppets of this system! And now get out of here Try to accomplish something tangible! This is my place - I'm expecting you, my son! Check it out... If you don't come now, I will kill myself! I'll feed my heart to the dogs I'll try to be back soon. It should not take long Arrivederci... Happy Valentine's Day from Earth Your tax-fiancee, whose dreams about great love you destroyed! Who might you be? Speak up, be honest I am detective Lipton Cockton from the police... We only accept possible criminal charge against the corporation in writing Do you have any search-warrant? - You have misunderstood me, I have no charges... I just want to be a product tester... I see... Hard times... even for officials. NEXT! You are in group Hormones A32 - Hormones? Yes, you know... red and yellow... muscles and desires Aren't they dangerous? - That's what you're paid for! Seems fair... - You can pick up your salary here... what the...? - Your first show? Listen, here we go... This is where the mind goes bonkers what the hell is going on? I have gathered material about all the most horrible stuff... A hooker might consider this normal. But who is right? Wrong decisions have been made for centuries in the name of humanity! We belong to the Union of Test Persons! A general strike... And they'll have to use rats again! We have to get out of here... Not yet, my friend We are committed to stay here for days So, let's have fun! You're allowed to cut loose here...! My, my. That was some bad stuff. It gets worse each time! But in my great condition you can take it A positive attitude and an open mind! I'm off on a date Fucking SHIT, Cockton! You've got 15 seconds sharp - to get the fuck out of there and go kick some ass... Or I will set your balls on fire! I see... Better go somewhere... If I go to get you those seeds then at least that thing will be taken care of You'd better stay here... One never knows what's out there By the way... That tree has to be fixed February 27th 5.17 AM. The exploded woman's ideas - about the multinational financial conglomerate made sense: people and business empires seem to do anything - to maintain this notion of a healthy life But this information did not advance my investigation, - and these crimes of exploding people were still not solved In order to find some snacks for the only creature that cared for me - I headed to the only shop in my neighbourhood - just to noticed that my area had lost its last grocery store To my total surprise I saw a familiar character in the shop window Piss off! Here it is, a unique sample of this model Well, maybe not this time... So long! First they poke around and then they leave without buying! Mister Cockton, fancy seeing you here... I'm sure you wonder about this change... We had to change assortment to take account of the demand... You see, dreams sell better than reality these days First I thought about doing groceries daytime, sex and violence at night But now I have realized that these sell well at any time Mornings start with hard porno. Middays we push violence And towards the night... we shift to hefty spanking But... what do you want? Normality or abnormality? I'm interested in the model in the shop window You mean the blonde? Would you like to try first? I beg your pardon? We have cosy rendezvous- shacks in the back... Forget it I'm interested in the dress. where did you get the costume? Please, step over here... Wait there, so nobody can see... I will take care of everything... Trust me... I see... who are you? And why are you busting in here? This is private property! I am a detective... Really? Upstairs is a dress that might belong to a female victim He is talking about the white costume in the store window They are specially designed clothes which have their own fans And you don't seem to be one of them Fix up this Don Quixote! No, for God's sake! I am a police officer! I was full of hate, and barely able to cool myself I had never allowed anything to affect my professional conduct But now I felt that this was the limit My immunity had been violated The sex products shop was connected to the killings, to say the least I decided to report this to my superior and drag him into the action Now we needed fire power! So, what news do you have for us? The world is changing... It is becoming a really dangerous place You may be right but so far on the wrong track I have bumped into the clothes of the dead... I suggest making a major bust on a certain sex products store You are far too excited. Explain to him, Pony... Yes, I am detective Kent Lumumba... what the hell! And I am Edgar Hampton, researcher of Internal Affairs Despite your prejudices we constitute the board of the Police Pension Fund You can never trust the institution... So we had to secure our future We do business! Incidentally, we are specialized in dead merchandize As you know, death is hot! So there is nothing strange about this Bodies build business Go, you have nothing more to give us And stay out of the way... Or you will have to deal with me... personally How could I have believed that all I had committed my life to - would turn out to be a lie In my mission to protect mankind I had only been supporting criminals The city had gone out of control... There was no illusion anymore of anyone taking responsibility I was exactly in the same position as this cock: The world didn't seem to give any room for us anymore... You stink like chicken shit Or is that some perfume from the cheap slut of yours? Is somebody living with you? I know somebody is over there why don't you answer me? My duty is to warn you, my son Desire, women...the most deceitful forces plot to destroy you That way will mess everything up for you Beloved son... wait... Be strong and suffer And one day you'll meet a girl - who you'll know is the right slut to lie on You with this sense of humour will be dealing with my Luger... who was it? Shouldn't have left you alone From now On we are one... Watch out... if you try to separate us! What are you here for? - We couldn't reach you, faggot Not even through message automation, intuition and parapsychology Your life is not worth anything anymore. So you've got to choose your side... That's why I'm here... and the cock in the oven The boss' symbolism, do you see... I don't get it - Get it or get lost! The boss says your worst problem is... wrong kind of humanity - and compassion for the weak He's got an offer, more useful to you than death So here I am... You don't know me, but if you wish to continue... You know the way to Apocalypse Gallery I am Lipton Cockton... Is that your pet? No, just a country cousin who was this woman featuring an ancient celebrity? And what was her plan? For me it was clear that he was the key to my solution So, sincerely my strategy was to make her reveal her secrecy I'll give you some free advice to honour shared moments You cannot drive around filthy like this - not even in this bean Dutiful citizen gets robbed, or what? 300 German marks... Or the double in dollars And the shield will shine like your mothers eye My mothers eye was always... black Let it stay shitty... to honour my mother You are fucking cheap! Normally we take it all And you seem to be a pretty lonely missy One that nobody misses... More than a dead body pisses... where are you heading? Straightforwards, towards the end! To a more romantic neighbourhood? Did you think, that a real man functions only in romantic situations? I mean, the more exciting the place, the more there is to enjoy And in this rush we are not going to make it to Mount Everest... Forgive me mother! You already know what I want It all started - when multinational corporations decided to bring in religious themes - in their product development and marketing what about LTD Productions... And the exploitation of human beings? That's just a small piece of this puzzle Through it, we can understand more... The solution is however to be found elsewhere... Elsewhere! Hell, tell me more about it... Or the fun stops here! - What do you mean? That I would not like to kill you for wanting my cock! A long time ago a group of progressively minded people - decided to save this planet... A mini version of Genesis was created Go on! Its agenda was a kind of a game... Apocalypse! Finally I saw everything clearly. I understood how my idea - of life worth living and recent events are connected Having already experienced death once - I was now approaching the stage of my final solution As there were different visions of the meanings of life - there also were different goals of this existence And now the alternatives were taking shape to me: Life for death... or death for life Isn't it so, that we would all like to see the hero survive - only with some bruises... And that we would all like this to happen in life - based on dreams which may turn to rotting cadavers No future events are yet consummated what will come remains in your hands... Just as I am shaping the fate of the future Our choices are not of small importance Because when we leave this earth we will sit there silent - crying over all what we have done to it.
