- Early start, Professor? - Yeah. I guess we're not following dive protocols today. - Thanks, Gitundu. - Right? OK! Sorry! And good morning to you too, Abby! How you going, little fella? You miss me? It's not good news, I'm afraid. Your home's dying and I don't know how to help. Abby? Hey, you've got a call. Oh, really? Thanks. Hi. Is this Abby Jackson? Yes. This is Dr Levine from the Longboat Bay Hospital in Western Australia. Apologies about the different time zones, but your mother's here with us. She's suffered a stroke. How severe was it? Is she stable? She's awake now and stable, but she's unable to speak at this stage. We were hoping you'd be able to get here. Yes, of course. I... I need to be there. - Thanks for... for finding me. - Yes, of course. - And letting me know. - Thanks, Abby. Abby? Everything OK? Something's come up. My mum's had a stroke. You need to go back home. Abby? Abby! Come on, sleepy head. Mum, I was dreaming. Congratulations, Abby. You're awake. Come on. - Today is the day. - My birthday? - You're eight years old. - Yeah. You know what that means? Come on! Maybe not this year. Mum! - Mum... - Come on. Whoo! That's where you're going. I can't, Mum. It's too far. It's just a warm-up. Abby, you're a big girl now and you've been swimming like a fish since you were 18 months old, yeah? No, Mum. Please don't. No, Mum! No! You're gonna have to try now. Alright? Straight down, follow the chain. - Equalise. - OK. Just glide. You got it? I did it. Come in. Come here. Come up. Oh, I'm so, so proud of you, alright? Now I know you can swim that deep... Yeah. ..there's something I want you to see, alright? OK. - Come here. - I did it. So this here is Robber's Head. Now, the reef splits apart here so there's caves and crevices who knows where, far too deep for you and me. This is the deepest part of the bay. - You up for it? - Yeah. Right. OK. Weight belts for this dive. And, remember, we only take... ..one abalone in three. That way, they'll still be here for your children's children to fish. Are you coming? Ohh! Mum, get in the boat. There's something down there. It's OK, love. - It nearly got me. - Come on, Abby. - Abby, Abby, take a look. - No, Mum. - Just please get in the boat. - Abby, Abby, Abby, quick. - I thought it was a shark. - No. That's a groper. Come on. Let's go say hello. I really can't believe it. He's big enough to eat your arm off. Must be old to grow that big. Yep. Gropers can live until their 70s. Old and wise. You must have made him feel safe, Abs. He'll always be safe with me. Well, the only way to make sure he's safe... ..is to keep him a secret. You see, gropers, they live in the same place most of their life. They don't tend to leave. Blueback. We'll call him Blueback and keep him a secret forever. Blueback? I like that. - Thanks. - See ya. What are you doing here? Briggs, you lunatic. Professor, some of us still live here. Don't 'professor' me. - You alright? - Yeah, thanks, Briggs. Give me your bag. The first stroke wasn't so bad. You know Dora. She said she felt "a bit ordinary" after a swim. Didn't even go to the doctor's till the next day, and that was in April. Then... ..she was out by Robber's Head. What do you think she was doing there? I don't know. Looking for whales again. A bit secretive, your mum. A bit sly, the Jacksons. Anyway... ..it doesn't look too good, Abby. They said she might not speak again. We'll see about that. So what do you reckon? Check out the abalone guy? The compressor's on. He must be under the water. Mum, you can't just get in someone's boat uninvited. He's taking too many. That's like breaking into someone's house. Yeah, he's got a licence. He knows the rules. -Macka! -Hey, Macka! Come on, ya old dog! Macka! Dora, what in the living hell are you doing? You right there? Give a man a heart attack, you will. Sorry to board your vessel uninvited, Macka. Oh, you don't look too sorry. You're taking too many. I mean, you know how long they take to grow. You're gonna strip this bay in no time if you keep this up. It's not as bad as it looks. It's pretty simple, really. Well, I'm a simple bloke so that's the best news I've heard all day. Now, are you the sheriff or the deputy today? I think I'm the deputy. Anyway, I know this looks a bit crook, but it's not as bad as it seems, honestly. Some of this stuff's from Henry's. - Mm-hm. - Some of it is from the Bluffs. It's a full day's work there. Yeah, alright. Shouldn't they be on ice, then? Yeah, it should be on ice. We should all be on ice. I'm getting a bit sweaty in my wetty. - On a day like this? - Yeah. How is the water? It's up about a degree, a degree and a half, I reckon. - Jeez. - Sure is warm. Righto, if you two high-sea bandits are finished, I've got some gastropods to harvest, in a sustainable manner, of course, in line with all the relevant health and safety protocols. - He can be a bit rough. - I like him. - He's not that scary. - OK. Mrs Jackson. Ted Costello. Wonderful view. Well, Ted Costello, I'm sure you'll enjoy it just as much from the car on your way home. I'm just here to drop off a proposal. I left it on your kitchen table. Door was open. I called out. We don't normally need to lock our doors around here. Doesn't mean we expect people to just walk in uninvited. Worth taking a look. -No rush, though. We're not going anywhere. Your neighbours all seem very interested. We're here, Abby. You want me to come in? Thanks, Briggs. I can take it from here. What happens if they won't let you take her home? Well, I feel sorry for the fella that says no to you. Come on, sleepy head. I'm gonna take you home. Mum? It's me. Here. Hey. Come on. I figured you might need some supplies. Thanks. I... I guess I'll leave you two villains up to your mischief. OK. Mum. Do you remember the drawings? This was my first. Mum? See ya. And here she is. Seven minutes late. New record. Come on. Come on! Time to make up. Been getting many fish out there? Yeah, some here and there. You know how it is. Like where, for instance? Fish are where you find 'em, Merv. Right! You Jacksons, I tell ya, the old apple don't fall far from the tree. You gotta give my love to Dora. - G'day, Merv. - Morning. - Hi, Merv. - Morning, Merv. - G'day, Briggs. - Hey. - Morning, lads. - Morning, Merv. Come on, kids. Let's go! Any ideas? Yeah, it's a banksia. I've seen this one growing down Wilder's Road too. There's heaps down my place. Red. Blue. Yellow. It's a Banksia attenuata, or 'biara' as it's known in the local Indigenous language. Go on. Try and draw it. Briggs! Abby! Wait here. What's going on? The entry to the bay is too shallow. They need to dredge the reef, create an entry point for larger boats. Mum said they need to pass an environmental assessment. The development isn't even approved yet. I don't think they're worried about needing an approval. Where are you going? - Abby! - See ya, Merv! Oi! What am I supposed to tell your mum? Wait for me. -Hi, Mum! Hey. Good day at school? The salmon's in, at last. Here you go. Yeah, alright. Thanks, love. - Hey, Dad. - G'day, mate. - Abby. - Hey. Come on. I'm gonna show you something. Don't be late! It's a blue whale. The biggest animal on the planet. This was just a calf, I think. They must get pretty big, hey? Dad said there were whalers here. Like, way back. - Yeah? - Yeah. There used to be so many whales, you could walk across them. Blues, humpbacks, right whales. Have you seen one? Sort of. Not really. Just like a white puff in the distance. Dad says we're killing a big hole in the world, all of us... ..and we're all gonna fall into it together. You sure he hasn't been talking to my mum? I'd like to see that. Yeah. So we were just about to send out a search party. Sorry, Mrs Jackson. Hey, Dad. Got the heads-up from Merv you might be down here. Sorry, OK? Briggs just wanted to show me something. That's all. Well, the good news is... ..we get a free feed. - Yeah? - We've been invited to dinner. Huh! Hey, Jimmy! Abby! Hey, I saw you today from my boat. You were down by the blue whale. You were with a fella. - Hey, Macka? - Yeah? I assume you've been invited, yeah? Well, I can see the flame from a mile away. That's an official invitation, isn't it, hey? Besides, they'll be glad I came. The fun's getting started now. Good one, Merv! - Whoa! Hey! - Oh, Macka! What's going on? What's going on, kids? What have we got here? What have we got here? Ten-ball shooter! -Thanks, Macka! Ooh! There we go. Point it upwards, OK? Nah, next year. Aww! - Macka. - Oh! Hey, hey, hey! Here we go! - That's so cool! - Another one! Briggs, hey! -Yeah, baby! Here we go, everyone! Here we go! Your mum's a good dancer. Yeah, Merv too, hey? You think he likes her? Sorry. That was a bit thoughtless of me. No, no problem with me, Briggs. It's fine. Everyone loved your dad. That's what my old man says. He was a pearl diver, right? Yeah. Yeah, he was. He headed north for the pearl season every year. Mum said he could come back with, like, a year's money in just a few months. But, I mean, he hated it. He worked so hard just to make a life for us. And then one year... ..one year came around when he just didn't come home after the season. They found his mask at the bottom of Roebuck Bay. They just never found his body. So the sea took him? A tiger shark most likely. I mean, that's what they said. Really? Not a word? You are so damn stubborn. OK. What have we here? A letter from the prime minister and a copy of your letter to him. You're being way too polite. My personal favourite. Did you get any takers? OK. One last thing. The dolphin, from the protest. Remember this? Mum! Seriously! I was a coward. It killed me. Save our bay! - You can breathe? - Yeah. It's not too tight? Yeah, that's it, Merv. - You can't get free? - No, it's good, mate. Save our homes! Save our bay! Save our bay! Save our bay! OK, we're in. It's done. What do you want me to do with this? - Eat it, Merv. - I'm not eating it. I'm not. Take it to the ocean, chuck it in. OK. Save our bay! Save our bay! Run, Merv! Run! -Come on, Dora. You've had your fun. This is pointless. You know what's in this truck? - What? - Ammonium nitrate. That's what's in it. It's your bay too, mate! - Settle down! - Save our bay! Save our bay! Save our bay! Save our bay! Save our bay! Save our bay! Save our bay! Save our bay! Save our bay! Save our bay! - Thanks, Ray. - See you. Say hi to the missus for me, will you? Will do. Hey. You were there today? At the protest? You know I was there. No, I didn't. - Must have been hiding, yeah? - No, I was there. When it comes to standing up for what you believe, there is no place for cowards, Abby. I'm not a coward, Mum! Yeah? It didn't seem that way to me. I'm not a coward! And your dad would've agreed with me! Well, that's real mature, bringing Dad into this! Hey, Mum. I just came to say that I'm sorry. Day's not over yet. Should we go find the old blue bandit? - Yeah. - Come on, bub. Come on. - I'm sorry too. - It's all good. - You alright? - Don't worry about it. Do you reckon we can get her out on the open water again? I'm not so sure. Come on. You used to be able to fix anything. I can give it a try. Do you think you might go to Robber's Head? I'm not sure if I'm up for that. Hey, you reckon we should do a quick check-up on Macka? Yeah. Hey, Macka! Hooroo! - Look out! - Hello. Ducks on the pond. Oh, pirate ducks at that. Hey, you know those fireworks you had the other night, yeah? I think they're actually illegal. Oh, no! You gonna call the authorities? I was thinking about it. How you doing down there, Macka? I was going OK till I had a visitor. Oh, well, if that's how you feel, we can just leave. Nah, I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about a man in a sharp grey suit. A shark? What kind of shark? Well, the kind you step out of the dance for, if you know what I mean, discretion being the better part of valour. A great white. Pretty great, pretty white, pretty big. With all this fresh meat lying around, I didn't want to tempt him. Didn't want to, uh, put his good manners to the test. They say I'm a bit tapped, ladies, but I'm not that mad. Seems pretty sensible, Macka. Oh, look out. Mum's agreeing with me. -"Dear diary," hey? Before you go... ..they tell me that this is the favourite of the old Achoerodus gouldii. I beg your pardon, the what? Groper, western blue. Scoffs my popcorn apparently. We don't catch groper. Well, most people don't. Can't say I do myself. Well, then, what are the crabs for? Well, because every old man likes a snack every now and then, Dora. You know about Blueback, don't ya? Blueback? That's a nice name. Righto, if you reprobates are finished, I'm gonna go finish off this beautiful little snack I prepared for myself, and then I'm gonna go... ..back in and check if old mate's still around. Come on, mate. Why don't you just get your boat out of here? Take it out west somewhere. I'm big enough and old enough to look after myself. Besides, I've always thought when the time's right for that sort of thing, the time's right. Know what I mean? No point worrying about things you can't control. Isn't that right, Abby? Yeah. Righto, back to work. Take care, Macka. - Hooroo. - Hooroo! Looks like we've had visitors again... ..laying out their surveyor's posts. Planning out where they're gonna build when we finally give in. Well... not today. Bye-bye! Yeah. That's the end of that, then. What are you reading? Um, it's a marine encyclopedia. Mr Carlisle lent it to me. To prepare for the new school. Western blue groper. Achoerodus gouldii? Yeah. A leafy seadragon. A Phycodurus... ..a Phycodurus eques. What kind of a name is it if you can't even say it? And the southern rock lobster, Jasus ed... edwardsii. So Briggs said the salmon didn't come in on time? Yeah, I spoke to Merv the other day. Yeah? He said that the sardines are dead all the way down the coast. And a dead leopard seal came in from Antarctica. So there's something going on. You'd think there'd be some way to, you know, read all these signs. It's a puzzle. With an answer? Yeah, there's always an answer. Storm's coming. Hey, Mum! Macka's still out diving. He should come in. Let me see. I think the compressor's stopped. Abby, come on. -Macka! Macka! Macka? The compressor's low on fuel. - Reckon you can get it going? - Yeah, I think so. Macka? Macka? Do not get in the water, Abby. Stay on the boat. - You understand? - Do you think it's a shark? Stay on the boat. -Come on! Come on, please! Come on! Won't be needing that. Was it that shark? No, he's just floating along the bottom. I reckon he's had a heart attack. So he's dead? Yeah, love. He's drowned. I'm sorry. This isn't gonna be nice, but, um... ..I want you to tie off that rope. I'll go down and secure him and when I come back up, we're both gonna have to pull. OK, alright. Thanks for checking. OK. Bye. Oh, Mum... Gitundu. Hi, Abby. How's your mum? OK. Not great, but it's good to be here with her. And the reef? Any news from the survey? That's why I'm calling. The drones came in this afternoon. The bleaching... Miles of it. More than we ever predicted. It's dying. The whole reef will be gone. We really need you here. When are you coming back? I'm not sure. About anything. Abby? Sorry, Gitundu. So I saw these amazing leafy seadragons down at the point yesterday. Mm? Never seen them before. Oh, come on, Jackson! Let's get wet. Come on. Come on! Your new school can wait. That's a reef stripper if ever I've seen one. They have the abalone licence. Poor old Macka's only just left us. We need to keep an eye on Robber's Head. Blueback, he... he's a big target. Yeah, I'm gonna have a word with them. With a boat that size, they should be fishing in open water. This is the most stupid and dangerous thing we could do. You told me, Mum, "To do nothing would be twice as stupid "and twice as dangerous." True. Abby! Hey, Mum, come up here. It's not just abalone. And so many undersized ones. It's hard to be discerning when you're stripping a reef. And these fish... Some of them are meant to be protected. How can they do this, Mum? I'm gonna go down and see what they're doing down there. I want you to stay on our boat. You understand, Abby? 'Cause some of these fish have been speared. -Bring it up. Bring it on. - Mrs Jackson. - Costello! I thought you'd have something to do with this. You're drag-netting open-water style. You're gonna fish the reef out completely! You don't want to talk about it? No, didn't think you would. - Don't worry about her. - Maybe your guys do. Guys? Do you realise exactly what you're doing here? Just ignore her. You're gonna strip this entire ecosystem... ..of marine life, so your boss can push his agenda through council. So why don't we talk about spear guns? There's a whole range of protected species here. Any of you blockheads know which ones they are? No? Didn't think so. Well, I'd be asking my boss if I were you. Hey, Mum, there's someone on Macka's boat. Alright. Let's get out of here. Come on. Sleazebag. Hey. What were you doing on Macka's boat? That boat's still good in open water? Yeah, sure is. Smooth as, even in a storm. Even in a storm. - You feel safe on it? - Yeah. The man who owned it took it out every day. What was he like? The man that took it out every day? Well, his name was Macka. And people called him Mad Macka. Maybe I did too. But I liked him. Abby? Why don't you head back up and get the meal going? I'll... I'll deal with this. She helped me pull him up. Big thing for anyone, seeing death for the first time. Well, I'm grateful for what you both did. Did you know Macka? He was my dad. Abby! It's yours. He would've loved you to have it. Are you really sure that I can have it? Macka's son. He said you could. Oh, wow! What do you reckon? That's an engine, alright. Alright? A bit rusty, but we could work on it together. Make it feel like yours, then. Oh, yeah. -I can't wait. OK, where are the tools? Abby? Hey? Here. Look. - Is that his son? - Yeah. Looks just like him. Do you know that the sea holds more artefacts and remnants of our history then all the museums in the world? And Mad Macka has most of them in here. What's this? Careful. Oh! It's an otolith. I've only seen a picture of one. What is it? It's a skeleton of an ear. The ear of a blue groper. See? Here are the lines along it, yeah? - There? - Yeah. Well, it grows a layer each year. You can tell how old it is. He was really old. Like, really old. How do you know that he was a he? Well, you see, all blue gropers are born as girls... ..and they start off green. And it's only when puberty hits that they change colour and some of them become boys. I want to show you something. Someone, actually. - Yeah. - Yeah? Alright. Come on. Now, the throttle will flood the engine if you're too hard on the old girl. - You feel that? - Like this? -That's it. You got it. Yeah. Come on. What'd you think? Oh, that was amazing. So cool! Hey, Mum, you alright? Yeah. I'm gonna head home. I gotta figure out what Costello's next move is. I'm gonna see you back at the house. - Before sunset this time, yeah? - OK, yeah. Doesn't look like they've started dredging yet. Maybe the protests slowed them down. Just make sure everyone's there in the morning, all the machinery's ready to go, and I'll see you after the council meeting, if not before. Yeah, no worries. See you in the morning. I think she looks better. Yeah, well, happier. She still hasn't said a word, though. The doctor said the chance of another stroke is so high now. Yeah, I know. That's it's just a matter of time. Time is all we have, Abby. I'm sorry it's been so long. There were my studies and all the opportunities overseas... It's fine, Abby. We were fine. You know Dora. She kept us up to date with everything you were doing, you know, read each letter out aloud. You know, she's very proud of you. Very proud. We are very proud of you. Hey, Dad. How you been? I'm worried. I don't know if Mum can stop them this time. And I wish I knew how to help. I really miss you. Mum. Well? Well... ..I just need to finish this proposal for the council tomorrow. Come on. What do you think? I think there's as good a school as any right here. Well, yeah, but two years there and I can head to university. It just... It feels like you're trying to get as far away from me as you can. Come on. You know you can visit. Maybe live with me over there. If I leave here, this house of ours will be bought by developers and Costello will win. Look, I want to save the world's oceans, Mum, and I can't learn everything I need to at the school here. Abby, this is your home, alright? You were born here. Your father was born here. Your grandparents. I just... I don't understand what you think you're gonna do on the other side of the world by yourself. Just come with me. You and me, we can make a difference together. Sweetheart, what do you think I have been doing here my whole life? I'm sorry, sweetheart. You look good. The uniform, all of it. It's just... It's really hard letting go. So I'm here to propose a marine reserve to protect the diversity of species that we have right here in this bay. This diversity, tell us about it. What threatens it? Well, I'm not... that good at all this kind of talk. I live on the bay so I've seen what's going on and right now, there are men overfishing... Your mum still banging on in there? I'm up next. That's how it works. She speaks and then I get an equal chance to argue my case. Fair enough, don't you think? You and your mum really think you can stop this. - Don't you? - Yeah. That's not how it works. You see, governments, they pay attention to short-term gains. Jobs. Economic activity. They need to get re-elected. I'll vote. To stop them. To stop you. Not until you're 18. I mean, as far as I'm concerned, that's just stealing from... ..stealing from our future. My name is Abby Jackson. Hello, Abby. And I'm 15 years old. I've been studying this bay since I was 8. Since then, I've been documenting the unique marine life in the bay. This here is a redlip morwong. And there are three different types of these seadragons, three, one of which is only found here, this incredibly rare leafy seadragon. And each and every one of them is threatened by Costello's planned development. And we have larger fish, like the western blue groper, or Achoerodus gouldii. They just love the moderate temperatures. They nestle here in... in reefs as havens from the weather along the coastline. These pictures show us the many species unique to this bay, documented for the first time, the diversity of this marine life, that it's a... I mean, it's a gift to us all. Well, we all welcome your work, Abby, but do you believe that we should make a decision today based on the, uh... the drawings of a child? Hang on a minute, Abby. Down at Robber's Head! Abby? Abby? Abby! Abby! You stupid girl! I told you to stay out of the water! - They've got spear guns, Abby! - I had to save him, Mum! - They could've killed ya! - I had to save Blueback. - There was no other choice. - Oh, Abby! He just wanted to play, Mum. I was running out of air. Those men, they wanted to kill him. So what happened? Did he get away? Well... - Well? - Well, I hit him one. I... I punched him, OK? Just to scare him off. Don't laugh, OK? - It's not funny. - Oh, God. You know, he's probably got some big black eye or something. Oh, get on the boat. Come on. He's gonna hate me now. That's for sure. OK, so let's start with the, uh... ..with the spear guns and the fact that that kid was nearly killed by one of your blokes. Yeah, look, I'm very disappointed about the spear guns. I didn't know these guys were doing this. So what's gonna happen now? Well, they breached the fishing limits set by their licence. Turns out that spear guns aren't typically used for fishing abalone and almost spearing a teenage girl is... is reckless endangerment. And today? - How'd it go after I left? - Well... There was six of them that had to vote. Five of them had hearts of stone. There was one, though. That woman from the other side of Cockatoo Bay. Yeah? She saw the sense in it. It was you that did it, Abby. Not me. It was your pictures. Your research. Just one vote? Oh... Just one for now. Next time two, then another, then another, then another... They're here. Where's Dora? Dora! Dora, come on, come on. Dora! - See 'em? - Yeah. Thank you. Ahh, yeah, yeah, there's about eight of them. Humpbacks! New babies too. Mrs J, is that why you were down at Robber's Head? 'Cause you were waiting for this mob to come through? Patient as ever. And you know the best place to view 'em? Right here. Alright, Mrs J, let's have a look for some more. I reckon there's a few out there lingering. Whoa! Oh, look at that! Whoo-hoo-hoo! You kept them, Mum. Where were they? He never came back, did he, Mum? I saved him sure enough. But I never saw him again. I truly believed he would have shared the secrets of the sea with me... ..if only he'd come back. Come on. When you were born... ..we took you down while the water was warm... ..and lowered you gently into the waves. Jack and me. We couldn't keep you out of the water. We come from water. We belong to it, Abby. What if he doesn't come back? If I never see him again, hey? Well, you saved him, Abby. That's the main thing. If that's the cost, then it was worth it. You ever notice that just before the sun sets, beyond the horizon... ..the sun burns even brighter just for an instant, lights up the whole sky? Yeah, it does. One last beautiful hurrah. Then it's gone. We are gathered here today, looking out across her beloved bay, to celebrate the life of Dora Jackson. Dora devoted her life to establishing a marine reserve for future generations that stretches from here all the way out to Robber's Head. A safe place at last. She wanted more of them, other havens along the coast, but for now, as she came to the end of her life, she was content with everything she had achieved. And as we say farewell to our dear friend, I thought I'd play a very special song for fearless Dora. Thanks, Briggs. No worries. I love you. Abby! Gitundu, you would not believe it here. My mum's marine reserve is thriving. I saw a huge pod of humpback whales. Every day, there are whales off the shore. Amazing. A marine reserve? That's incredible, Abby. And it's beautiful. If you can gather my research material and the latest footage of the reef, we've got some work to do. Great. Where do you want to begin? - Let's start right here. - Yep. Take a good close look at what we're fighting for. Amazing. We'll be there. Thanks, Gitundu.
