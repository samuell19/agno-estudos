She just went downstairs. Good. Let's get started. Sarah? Jules? Girls? Mom, Mom! - Sarah? - Please! - Jules? - Mom! Momma! Open the door! - Mom, help! - Sarah! Please! Jules! Jules? - Yeah? - You okay? Zonin' out there, babe. - Yeah, I'm fine. What is he saying? He's telling her to shut up. Can you tell him to stop? I don't think we need him. - Jules, I don't think we should interfere. I don't think we need it. It's fine. Tell him to stop, please. What is he saying? He says, "All of this might look barbaric to her, but if she keeps silent, she might learn a thing or two about helping others, instead of making money from their misery". Excuse me? I'm sorry, I think he's hurting her. We don't need it. Tell him we can just stop it. We don't need it. Thank you. Does it make you sleep better at night thinking you can shut out the things you see? Excuse me? And cut. Good, you got it? - Got it. - Good. Ben, you good? - Yeah, I got it. Good. All right, let's pack up. Let's wrap out. - Thanks. - We're gonna get on the move soon. Jules, you good? I'll be there in a minute, yeah. All right, we'll be in the van. I'm sorry. I thought you were hurting her. The nails contain a curse sent by a former lover, but you could tell that, couldn't you, even if you no longer see? There is no evil, only ignorance. That's easy for you to say. You have an ability, but you use it only for profit. We all have bills to pay. What is it? Our sorrows and wounds are healed only when you touch them with your compassion. Jules, we gotta go! You good? - You guys ready? Let's go. I'm always laggin' behind. I need the fuck outta here. Okay, remember where to go? The same way we came with a different intersection. The same way we came, you idiot! Oh, my god! Here, pull over right now. Just let me drive. I can handle this. - No! Wolf, I know the way. - God, you're such a baby! - I got this. Let's go! How do you they didn't get shot? Okay, I guess we're back to keepin' secrets then. I'm sorry. Look at you two, makin' out in front of us, not makin' us feel weird at all. You ever heard the saying, don't shit where you eat? It's for you. It's for me? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, we can do more? Yeah, keep doin' it. Oh, yeah, this'll be fun. So Annie, I was wondering, why did you drag us to that place? I mean, do you like seeing monks hurt little girls? - Come on, man! - Hey! Don't mind my brother. Most people find it hard to believe, but beneath that asshole front is a really sensitive soul. Beneath that is a crusty, old bastard. I didn't like what the monks were doing either, you know. I just thought it would be interesting, because Mr. Crane mentioned it. No, no, no, just Matty. We're all family here. Okay, Matty. I thought it was interesting for your show, you know. It was my fault. He was just trying to help her. Is that what he said, he's helping her? You know what? Annie, I just realized we haven't officially welcomed you to "The Skeleton Crew". So this is for you. Yay! Welcome! - Yay! - Nice! Thank you. So how do you guys figure where you are going next? Jules, will you do the honors? - First... - Wolf. - Yep, yep, yep. Oh, yep. Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep. Ready? Rollin'. So ever since we announced we're touring Asia, viewers in the region have been writing to us to investigate their homes. Now, most of them aren't genuinely haunted, but this is how we choose which ones are, or might be. Bullshit. Bullshit. Bullshit. Faking it. Nonsense. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. Is she even reading them? Just watch. Definitely faking it. Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit. Faking it, bullshit. Bullshit. We have something. - Yeah? Great, here we go. Fraser's Hill in the state of Pahang. Did I pronounce that right, Anne? - Yes, Pahong. - Great. Wolf. All right, well, I will call them and tell 'em we're on our way. Okay, it's a four hour drive. This how you choose the location? Based on what? Effin' freaky shit, huh? God, I hate this stupid seatbelt! I'm not wearing it anymore. - I'm sorry, turn back a little bit. Take a left at the next corner. All right. Is it on? Yeah, go ahead. It's okay, honey. - Okay. Well, hi. My name is Martha Benchley, and this is Ian, my husband. Hi. Yeah, we heard "The Skeleton Crew" was coming over to Asia, and, like, I mean, we- - We're big fans. So- - Yeah, we watch the show all the time when here in Malaysia. And... We... Hey! You know, they get this all the time, right? Just tell 'em. It's okay, honey. All right? Look, we... We desperately need your help. Please help us. Get off me! You're sure we got the right address? This is it. All right. Here we go. It's a nice place. Where's the welcome wagon? Hey, Mr. Benchley? Matty Crane here. Yes, yes, we just arrived. So listen, we'd love to get a shot of you coming out of the house and greeting Jules. Yeah, but don't mention the show on camera, and don't look straight at it, okay? No, it kinda breaks the fourth wall. The fourth... Just don't look at it and don't mention the show, okay? Great. Oh, we're unloading now. Come out in about a minute? Yeah. Batteries. All right, see you then. Bye. - Batteries. Charged? Charge the batteries? - Yeah, let's go. Okay, guys, let's set up... Let's set up right here. Let's get him as he's comin' outta the front door, okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, like every other time we do this, of course. Well, this is truly an honor. Ian Benchley. Thank you so much for coming, Ms. Julia. My wife and I, we're big fans of your show. Just Jules, please. Right, Jules, Jules. You know, when your producer told us that we've been chosen to be on the show, I couldn't believe it. - Yeah, that'd be me. You guys cut. Matty Crane. - Ian. - Nice to meet you, Mr. Benchley. We just now spoke about the fourth wall. Yeah. This is my cameraman, Wolf and Ben. The cameramen. The real geniuses behind "The Skeleton Crew". You wouldn't know that by how much he pays us. And this is our local translator and guide, Annie. Hi. Well... Right, as I was saying, thank you all for coming. There. Thank you for comin'. I mean, it's been a relief since we knew we were gonna be on the show, especially for Martha, my wife. And she's inside. Things haven't been going too well lately. Why don't you tell us all about it? Right. You'll understand as soon as you come in. Wow! It's beautiful. The house is so new. Haunted houses usually aren't this freshly built. - Well- - It is fairly new. It was built in the 1970s, I believe. If you don't mind, Martha's this way. Sure. Earth Mother who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, as we forgive sins. Honey? It just happened again, Ian. I don't know how long I can take this. - It's okay. - No. It- - Breathe. - What? - Look who's here. No. Oh, I'm so sorry. Can we pan across? I'm such a mess. You don't want me to just snap, zooming it out over and over again? - Your Martha? - Just do it, Wolf. Come on. Why don't you tell us what happened? Oh, that's what we're hoping you would tell us. Like, look, this just happened. I just painted these. She gets into a trance, paints pictures of this man. She's never met him or seen him. Do you feel anything? Can you sense them? Let her do her job. I'm sorry. I just... Sorry. Jules? I got nothing. Can you try again? Something's off. You chose this place. On the email and the video, yeah, but ever since I've been here, I've got nothing. So what now? There's more. If that helps? Martha, were you watchin' us from an upstairs window? Well, I wasn't. We moved in here around six months ago. Ian was doing business in KL. Kuala Lumpur? Yeah, I mostly work from home, and this place on the market for such a steal we just had to have it. And the first three months, nothing happened. We moved in. We decorated the house, and- - The previous owner was an nice man, Australian? - Yeah. Lived here for a couple of months with his wife. That's not long. Well, about two months ago, some pretty weird stuff started happening. I'd go to sleep, but ever morning I'd wake up in different parts of the house. I'd wake up in bed covered in soil. That's strange. You must be very religious? Not really. Ever since all this started, it's comforting to have them around the house. This happened shortly after we contacted you guys. It's there. This, the paintings, this never happened before. It's like whatever's doing this is threatening us somehow. Or trying to stop us from gettin' help. Anything? - Mm-mmm. - Hey! Those are my garden shears. I was cuttin' flowers this morning. I must've left 'em there. Could this be like a poltergeist or something, you think? Poltergeist is just a German word for ghost. Noisy ghost to be exact. That or seismic activity. Martha, do you have any pets, like a dog or anything? You don't seriously believe a dog did this? We're just trying to rule out the possibilities. Maybe you should see the basement? We had workers come in to rewire the basement last week, but they refused to come down. Just watch the step. Guys, whoa. We mostly use the basement for storage, laundry, but we stopped usin' it for the time being. Oh, good god! - I'm sorry. - Oh, wow! What's that? It smells like roasted dick! Duck. The smell started last week. We've tried almost everything to get rid of it. We even tried scrubbin' everything down. Yeah, but it only got worse. Can I borrow these? Sure. No, listen, that has to be recent. I told you, we scrubbed every inch of this floor. That wasn't there. You have to believe us! I mean, seriously, you can't take the case? - Okay. No, we're good. I think we've seen... I think we've seen everything we need to see. Thank you. Appreciate it. Nice to meet you. So you must think we're idiots or worse, that we made all this stuff up? I don't. I think sometimes we want these things to be real, so we make them real in our minds. What is that? - What? That noise? Martha? Jules! Jules, what the... Jules, what the... What the fuck are you doing? - Stop it! What... Stop it! - Matty, stop! - Stop! Stop it! We popped 10 fuckin' benzos in a row! - It's my fucking medication! - All right, stop. What the fuck happened down there? Fuck! I fucking saw it, Matty. What? Whatever it is that's haunting that house fucking touched me! Okay? It's trying to make contact. It's trying to make it through. Okay. Well, that... It's a good thing, right? It's not supposed to happen like that. What are you talking about? What do you mean? We deal with this kinda shit every day! Jules, I have seen you lead our cameras to places, to things I can't even explain. Because I sense them. I hear them. That is it. I point the camera in some direction, you get some bullshit on camera, and we fuck off, and we get paid. That is all I signed up for! But they don't fucking touch me, Matty! Because I do not want them to. I can't have them. Okay. I'm not gonna let them hurt you, okay? I promise. Can you hear me? Loud and clear. Comin' down the next room. So these are the night vision cameras? No, better, they record on multiple wavelengths, infrared, all that stuff. Yeah, thermo sensitive as well. Many, they can detect minute changes in room temperature. We've got them wired to every corner of the house, so if something turns up, we'll get it on tape. Yep. Good. I guess we'll leave you to it. Yeah. And there's food and drinks in the kitchen stocked. Great, thank you. - Thank you. - Okay. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. So I'll go to bed, too. - Okay. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Okay, we're all set. Nice work. Did you talk to him? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. What? My brother and I were sort of wondering when we're gonna get our first payment? I mean, we only came all the way out here because of cash you promised. And you're gonna get it as soon as this episode is wrapped, as promised. Like you promised us in Austin? Austin wasn't my show. You know that! I was the line producer. I got screwed, too. - Bullshit. - Hey! Didn't I get you two a union gig for a whole season? Yeah. It's fine with me. You cool? - Yeah. - All right. Okay. Boss, by the way, what the hell happened earlier? I haven't seen her like that before. Honestly, I don't have a fuckin' clue either. Want me to go? - Then go ahead. - All right. This pair of five's is a queen kicker. What you got? What you got, son? Boom! What the fuck, man?! That's three times in a row tonight. Losin' your touch there, bro. - No, you're cheating, bro! - I'm fuckin' not. God! You ever wonder why people don't just move? I mean, if their house is haunted, why would you stay here? I don't know. Would you move if you dumped all your life savings into the house? Yeah, I'd move! Are you kidding me?! And what if they move and the spirit follows them, and... Shit, shit! Where's Ian going? We've got a walker. Where are you goin', Mr. Benchley? All right, 10 bucks says the guy takes a leak. You don't have 10 bucks. Did that shut down? - No. Camera. - Come on. - Camera, camera, camera! Wheel. Go time. Come on, come on, come on! Go, go, go, go, go! To the right! - Oh, shit! - Help me! Oh, shit! Holy shit! - Help me! Whoa! Martha? - Why won't you- - Martha! Martha! No! Martha? Martha? Martha? Jules? Jules? - Matty? Jules? Matty?! - Come on! - Matty! Jules! Jules! - Matty! - The door! Why don't you open the door? Martha? Martha? Jules, can you hear me? - What's happening? - Jules? They're locked inside. - Who's locked inside? - Jules and Martha! Martha! Martha! - Open the door! Martha? Jules? Jules? Martha! Jules! Martha? Martha. - You're Jules. - You okay? What happened? Where am I? It's okay. It's okay. Oh, god! Quick! It's okay. It's all right. Sorry. Help me! Fuck me! This is fuckin' insane! I mean, we've done haunted houses before, possessions, exorcisms, you name it. We've never seen anything as genuine, as concrete, as this, man. Whoa, you're gonna bust a nut if you don't slow down. No, no, this is the first time in the history of the show that we've ever come close to actually proving the existence of the paranormal. I mean, look at the footage! Yeah, the kid's right. At least no one will say we're faking it anymore. Everything all right? Fuck, yeah, I can't do this, Matty. Jules, Jules? Shit! Off she goes again. Pull up Annie's bedroom. - I'm quitting! - What?! Jules! Stop! I can't do this, Matty. Okay, I'm seein' it everywhere! What? This is gonna keep going until it hurts somebody. We need to leave. Well, then, don't look. Look away. It doesn't work like that! You think I haven't tried?! Well, then, try and communicate with it. You've only ever listened, right? You've only ever overheard things? Find out what it wants! We've never done that for the show! You don't know what you're talking about. If you knew what could happen, you wouldn't even ask. Well, then tell me what is gonna happen! You can't just fucking leave, Jules! We're doing a show, for Christ's sake! You're show! Our show! That's all you ever cared about, isn't it? That is not fair. That's good. - All right. - Make sure you back this one up, too. Yeah, I'll transfer it. Good morning. Wait. Where the fuck were you? What? - Last night? - Wait a minute. Yeah, you were asleep just before the possession. You didn't hear anything strange last night? What are you talking about? All right, see for yourself. You're tellin' us you slept through the whole thing? - Martha. - I need to speak with Jules, please. - Jules... - Went out for a bit. I need you to see something. Look at me, look at me, look at me. It's Ian, it's Ian, look at me. Look at me. Look at me. It was just a dream, okay? It was just a dream, huh? All right. Give me that. Give it to me. Give it to me. Go back to sleep. - Uh-huh. All right? She does not look good. It wasn't easy convincin' the doctor she'd fallen down the stairs. But if I'd told him what really happened- - I know. I know. She remembered somethin' from last night. It was in her dreams this time. This is the same man she drew before. - Good morning. - Good morning. A long night, huh? You have no idea. Can I have a scotch, please, no ice? Sure. Thank you. You are American. I recognize the accent. Guilty as charged. You local? Well, for the past 50-odd years. Are you staying in town? You know the Benchley's? I do. It is a small town. Are you one of the Benchley family? No, no, I'm... I'm doin' a thing at their house. Kind of like a investigative journalist. Journalist, ah! We don't get many up here. Funny you should mention the house. Most people here try to avoid talking about it. Why? Every person who has ever lived in the house moved out, and suddenly, too. Where are you going? I'm gonna go look for Jules. May I join you? Not a good idea, Annie. But why don't you stay here with the guys? I won't be long. You must love her a lot? You get to a certain point where you stop believing in love. So what do you believe in then? Jules and I are two people who happened to need each other at the right moment, and that moment got picked up, renewed for a second season. What happened seemed like something ruins the moment? What, like Jules running off now? I didn't say that. What do you know about the house? It was built by a local businessman. It was his holiday retreat. But one day, he just disappeared, just like that. And after that, the house just has been passing from owner to owner. Do you know anything about the last owners? Australian couple, the Keenes. Rumors say his wife suffered a mysterious and terrible injury. What kind? Enough for them to move out just after a few months. All the previous owners left under similar circumstances. What circumstances? Something terrible happened to their wives. Maybe when you go back to the house, you will be able to see? Your friends are in grave danger if you don't. Huh? And you talk to who? I was... I'm sorry, who is that? Used to own this place. Okay, what do you mean, "used to"? He's dead. Years ago. - How? His pregnant wife, one day, she just disappeared. He died from sorrow. And how did you get in here? - I'm sorry! This place is closed, you know? - I'm sorry! I'm sorry! When I first met Jules, she was a total train wreck. In and out of rehab, waiting to explode, but she had this ability. I suggested we go into business together. A TV producer and the medium. She's always carried her past around with her. I've tried to get her to open up about it, but- - She's secretive and it hurts that she shuts you out sometimes. I'm sorry. That was out of line. But not far off the mark. This coffee isn't workin' for shit! So tired. Hey, you hear that? What? Play it again. What is that? Sounds like a crying kid. The Benchley's don't have a kid. I'm gonna try and isolate the sound. What the fuck? I've got a camera malfunction. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Fuck you! Fuck you! Whoo, yeah. Ben? Ben? Ben? - No, Ben. - Come on, come on! Come on! - Ben! - Come on! Ben, Ben! Wake up. - Oh, my god! - Shit! - What happened? Where the fuck you been? Oh, no! - Ben! Hold him, hold him! Look at me! Ben, look at me! He's having a seizure. - Ben! - Do something! No! - It's the man! - What? Put something in his mouth or he'll chew his tongue out! Okay, hold. It's the man in my dreams! It's him! Our Father, who art in heaven... Hallowed be thy name. As thy kingdom come... We know you killed your sister. She suffers greatly. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Deliver us from evil. Ben, Ben? Hey, hey! Hey, hey, hi! This'll help. Jules? God! Yo, what the hell happened to my brother? And why didn't you help him? I mean, you're the fucking expert, right? He was possessed. Possessed by who? I don't know! You don't know or you won't say?! Why don't you bring it down a notch, huh? Whatever possessed Ben seems to know a lot about you. Don't you wanna stop it? Or maybe... Maybe you're scared of it? Maybe you're scared of what it knows about you? Is that what it is? What it said about your sister, is that true? Did you kill her? Don't you fucking bring her into this! Listen, you are gonna help my brother. Go out, have a smoke, take your pills, do whatever you have to do to pull yourself together, and then you're gonna come back in here, and you're gonna make him better. You hear me?! Right, right, enough. You need to calm yourself. This is bullshit! Fuck! Fuck! What will you do now? I don't know. Matty? Shit! Shit! Jules, stop. - Forget it, - Jules, stop! Will you talk to me? About what? Look, we were out looking for you. I was worried about you. I could tell. She kissed me. Yeah, and I kissed her back. What do you want me to say? Jules, when you don't take care of something, it dies. You're gonna blame me for this? Do you know how hard it is to love someone like you? No matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, I'm not good enough for you. I can't help you. I can't understand what's going on with you, because you won't let me. What am I supposed to do? I was trying to protect you, Matty. From what? You don't wanna know. Thanks. When I was a kid, I used to see them, talk to them, and I would call them, and they would come, my aunt, this old man who lived downstairs. No one believed me, except my sister, Sarah. She knew. And we made a game of it. We would lock ourselves in our room, and we'd call up the soul of some, like, celebrity we had heard had died, or our cat. And then one day, we called up the soul of the boy who had died. Sarah had had a crush on him for the longest time. But when he came, he didn't wanna leave. He was angry. Get out! And he ate her soul and made me watch. Ever since that day, I swore I'd never contact another spirit, and I tried shutting it out altogether, and I tried everything. And then one day, it just stopped. But I've seen you, I mean, on TV. You can sense them. Yeah, that part never goes away. I figure, you might as well make a living, right? But the point is, is that I stopped contacting them, and they stopped talking to me, and I can't go through that again, Martha. I'm sorry. I can't help you. At least, please help my baby. The doctor's confirmed it. I've known for a couple weeks now. How far along are you? Three months. Ian doesn't know. I made the doctor swear not to tell him. He doesn't want kids. And for some reason, despite all that's happened, the baby's still alive. Please. I don't wanna lose my baby. Please. These symbols, do you know what they mean? Can you read them? That's weird. I can't. But they look like the symbols of the good luck charms, the one the monk made in the temple. Like the symbols the monk tattooed on the girl? Yes. But I thought that was for protection to, like, ward off evil or some shit? I don't know. Right. We'll get to the bottom of this, Wolf. I promise. You better. I'm holding you personally responsible. Okay, talk to me. I'm entering the room. Are you getting this? Loud and clear. And Jules... Thank you. All this time, and you never knew there was another room? The room was hidden. How could they know it? - Did I ask you? - Hey! Take it easy! Now, let's just focus, okay? - Fine. - That's enough. Jules? Ben picked up the sound of a crying kid before he went up there. Copy that. That's a lot of toys for a kid. Maybe there was more than one? [] Jules, are you sure you gotta do this by yourself? Yeah, it's safer for me if you stay downstairs. We don't want anyone else getting possessed like Ben. Look at these dresses. This is the date. 1972. This house was built in the '70s. It's a lot of uneaten candy. Who gives a shit? Are you pickin' up anything? Nothing. I'm not getting anything. Would you try harder? That thing attacked my brother! Wolf, for fuck's sake, man, will you take it easy? Try harder, please. What the fuck is goin' on? There's no one up there except her. What the fuck is happening? Jules, are you there? Jules, can you hear me? Jules? Jules? - Where's Martha? - Jules? Where's my wife? - Where's Ben? - No, no, no, no, no! Hey! Come on. Yeah. Why can't you be quiet? Forgive us of our trespasses, huh? Martha! Will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Jules? Martha! Jules? Martha! Martha! Go help Ian, go help Ian! Take this. Jules! Dammit! Jules, can you hear me? Jules? I'm scared. As long as we stay in the circle it won't escape. Matty! Matty! Jules! Jules! Jules, can you hear me? Martha, Martha, Martha? - Ben? - Is he here? - Ben? - Is she okay? I want her out of this house! Oh, shit! You scared the hell outta me, man. You okay? Wolf? Wolf? Annie, help me. Wolf? Wolf? Wolf? Where's Ben? Shh, I'm here, it's okay. You're gonna be okay. Wolf, where's Ben? What happened? Talk to me, man. Come on, man. He made me. He made me. Who? Who made you do what? The crucifix. He made me suck the crucifix. - Oh, my god! Ohh! Get off me! Don't touch her! I will rape her soul! This is my home, bitch! In my hometown, those tattoos were a custom for our protection. Everyone has one. When it was my turn, I begged a monk to let me go. It hurt so bad. I fainted more than once. My own mother held me down, so the monk could finish his job. I was only nine. I have never believed it worked until now. That's why you slept through the first night. They can't touch you. So what now? Our sorrows and wounds are healed only when we touch them with compassion. Get the car keys. You and Annie are gonna go find him. Who? My backup. Jules? He's here. Thank you so much for coming. I see you have chosen compassion. I had to. My abilities, they came back. Of course they did. I give them back to you. There's no evil. There is only ignorance. When wisdom prevails, evil ceases to be. Let us begin. Don't let go of the string. Show yourself! I'm not picking anything up. I said, show yourself! Nothing. No one's here except us. What do we do now? I don't know. They've been the one initiating contact. They should be all around us right... Now. Don't look at him. Remember last night, Wolf? He's not your brother. We had so much fun. You're not my brother. Not your brother? You are a fucking piece of shit! I'm wearing his filthy, little, cocksucking soul! Not my brother! You knew Mom was doing all those things to me. What did you do? You stood and watched. What? I was just a kid. Did you like watching Mom do all those filthy things to me? Don't listen to him. It's not Ben! Martha. Sweet Martha. Ian, you know what I did to your wife last night? She was so fucking sweet. So fuckin' sweet! Who are you tryin' to call? I'm here, goddammit. Wanna talk? I'm right fuckin' here, you stupid slut! Yes! There was no one else in the house. It was just you... And me! - Jules! - Don't let go of her! There's somebody behind Martha! There's a whole bunch of 'em! Shit! It's inside of her! I sense the anger from the spirit within her. Can you hear them? What's he talking about? Who's he talkin' about? The spirits inside Martha. They're trying to get out of whatever spirits are inside Ben. Who's inside Ben? The one who killed us! Holy shit! Oh, my god! You okay? Martha? Martha, Martha? Honey? Hey. No! Oh! - Help me, Ian! - Martha! Don't touch her! Yeah, no, wait, wait, wait! Why?! Why won't you see?! Jules, quick. Jules, please help her. Is this her? Why won't you see?! It's okay. - No. - Annie, come here. Put it down. There's something behind this wall. Jesus! Are there any real walls in this place? - Wolf, get the light. - Yeah. What is this place? It's a projector. Oh, my god! They're not here. What the fuck was that? Kuman Thong. What the hell is Kuman Thong? The spirit of dead children... Taken from their mother when they are not born to protect and empower their master, the master of the house. And in her, are the spirits of dead women... Who's stolen children now serve as master. That's what's inside Ben, their master? The Kuman Thong protect their master and his house, even after its master is long gone. It's why I couldn't sense anything, because they were protecting him. Nothing. He is now after a new victim, a new child, to join his ranks. Why? None of this makes any sense. Martha's not pregnant. Oh, god! All this time, all they wanted was for us to see.
