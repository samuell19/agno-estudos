Subtitles by explosiveskull Sync by Bargain Okay, everyone, here we go. The movie's about to start. Centuries ago, our galaxy was brought to its knees by an alien race of unparalleled ruthlessness. No, not these guys, these guys. See? Mean, right? The invaders possessed an amulet of unlimited power known as, "The Amulet of Unlimited Power." With it, the aliens conquered and enslaved every race on every planet they encountered, including our own. But what the aliens didn't count on was the existence of another creature who lived amongst the humans, "The Featherless Condor." Well, uh, mostly featherless. The Condor took the amulet from the invaders, forcing them to flee into the far reaches of space. And there was much rejoicing and also cake. Fearing that the aliens might one day return for the amulet, The Condor decided to hide it deep within the earth. Braving untold dangers, he reached a secret location where he knew the amulet could never be found. And so, the galaxy was liberated. As one generation succeeded another, and another, and another, the descendants of The Featherless Condor forgot about the aliens. But the aliens did not forget. They swore that one day they would take back that which they had lost, and then, they would wreak their vengeance upon us all. And welcome back to Pelotillehue Stadium for this exciting game brought to you by My Eyes, My Eyes Tear Gas. It's the 2,606th match between Pelotillehue and Buenas Peras. And this time, it's personal. And look at Condorito go, weaving past the defenders like a rat in a bony chicken's kitchen. Kiss my feathers. Go, Condorito, go! Condorito! I got to do more cardio. Ignorancio, mark him up. Huh? Oh, right away, coach. Yeah. Yes, go Tio! Condorito with a perfect pass to Iron Throat and... it seems Egghead has once again been mistaken for the ball. But there's Condorito with the steal. Oh, wait, what's this, Pepe Cortisona has just stolen the ball from his own teammate. And look at this, yes, it's the patented Pepe pec juggle. And could it be? Yeah, he's incorporated some ass into it. Oh, what a game we have here today, ladies and gentlemen, and now it appears that Pepe is making googly eyes at a member of the audience. My knee, my knee, oh, my knee! My knee! He's a murderer. I can't feel my beak. Huh? Use your eyes, fool. Can't you see that bird brain is just faking? Farewell, I'm going into the light. And it looks like the referee has ejected Pepe for diving. Papa, is that you? But of course the real drama here right now is Condorito. I'm okay. I'm okay. Never have I seen such a miraculous recovery. Hallelujah, what a moment to be alive, and with just seconds left on the clock, Pelotillehue has the ball. Hmm? Goal... Condorito! And the referee whistles, it's over, 1-0 for Pelotillehue! Victory, victory, victory! Free drinks for everyone at El Tupos. Huh? Well, at least they got their priorities straight. Tio, that was your best death scene ever. Thank you, Chickie. Condorito! Oh, wait, kids. I just don't understand what it is you see in that fool? Did someone say the orphanage needs a new ball? Mm-hmm. My love, for you. I had one eye on the clock. Come on, kids, it's getting late, time to get back on the bus. It looked like the Buenas players were all going after you. Well, I guess that's the price you pay for being this attractivo. And to who do you dedicate this victory? I dedicate this victory to world peace. - Oh. - Aww. Uh, rainforests. Aww. And, of course, to all the puppies of the world. No more questions. Do you always have to flirt with those... ...those bimbos after every single game? Huh? No, I do that for the ratings. Oh, please, my darling, you know my heart beats only for you. Yayita, Yayita. You see? And look, I have a surprise. Ta-da! I got us tickets to the boxing match tonight. Bruiser versus Midget Avenger, it's gonna be the fight of the century. Are you kidding? Did you forget it's my mom's birthday tonight? Hmm. I didn't forget, uh, I repressed. Huh? Tremebunda, my dear. Please accept this present for this felicitous occasion. Oh, a gift card for the spa? Thank you. To preserve your untouched beauty's perfection. Her beauty is untouched because nobody would touch her. Huh? Oh, Pepe, how considerate of you. Oh, I keep praying for my daughter to come to her senses and find someone like you. Perhaps she already has. May I give you a ride home? Oh, my car! But Yayita, we were going to go celebrate at El Tulfo. You just better not be late tonight. What do you mean late? Is there something going on tonight? A toast for the winners. - Cheers. - Cheers. And one for losers. - Cheers. - Cheers. And for the winners, yeah. Cheers. Uh, Condorito, are you okay? Huh, why do you ask? Oh, it's Pepe, that bucktooth lead sack is trying to steal my Yayita from me with his money. If it's with money, then it's not stealing. The rich think they can just do whatever they want. Well, no more, I tell you, no more. What are you going to do? I'm going to get Pepe out of my way once and for all. After this, Pepe Cortisona will no longer be a problem. Get rid of Pepe? Just what are you planning to do? - Huh? - Oh. Do you have it? Condorito, are you sure you wanna go through with this? There's no other way. To save Yayita from Pepe, I must commit the most heinous sin a man can do. Propose marriage. But he was so young. My friend, you always said you'd give up your life before you gave up your bachelorhood. Yayita is my life. Without her, I have nothing. Well, if that's how you feel, then we have to stand beside you. This calls for a drink. To Condorito. Are you loco?! I've got to go! Right behind you! How dare you even think of marrying my precious Yayita? But she and I are meant to be together. She is meant for a prince, not some unemployed, ugly, ignorant, penniless, smelly, dimwitted, bird brain like you! Get this through your thick excuse for a skull! As long as I walk this earth, you will never, never marry my daughter! Not now, Washington. Tio, I hooked us up to the power line, hacked into the neighbor's Wi-Fi, and put the cockroaches in the bed to eat all the bed bugs. That's good. Did you have another fight with Yayita? It's not Yayita. It's her mother. That hairy ogre won't stop until she breaks us up. Is there anything for dinner? Not just anything. I made your favorite, pizza with French fries and ketchup. Ah, Chickie, you're the best. It's nothing. Huh? That's a weird number. Hmm, probably some spam thing. Ha, nice costume. Featherless Condor, we have searched for you for many space years. And now, I wish to make you an offer. Let me guess, you have a wireless plan that is out of this world? Huh? I'm not a sale rep for a cell phone provider. Bring me the amulet of unlimited power and I shall give you anything that you desire. Shouldn't you say, "Amulet you bring me. Anything you desire I give." That's a stereotype. We're still waiting. Amulet you bring me. Anything you desire I give. Anything I desire, huh? Take Tremebunda to your planet. Then we have ourselves a deal. I mean, ourselves a deal we have. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear mother ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ I know I asked you to only use one candle. Relax, woman. You'll think different once I light this baby up. Dad, do something. It's okay, Mom. There now. All good. Time to open presents. Ooh, it's that new perfume we saw at the mall, isn't it? Even better. Uh, an electric razor for women? It's industrial-strength. Why, you can shave a bear with this thing. Could this night get any worse? Did somebody order a son-in-law? Treme. Why, you don't look a day over 65. Mwah. Well, I'm only 59. Ah, preparing for the future. Very clever. I take it the boxing match ended early? My love, please. Forgive me. And of course, I've brought something for the queen of the day. Ta-dah. Uh... I kept the receipt. Do you all just see some sort of hairy animal when you look at me?! Mom, please, calm down. Sometimes, I wish someone would just come and take me away from this living hell! Huh? Tremebunda. Tremebunda. No, Mom! No! Treme! Featherless Condor, as agreed, I have taken Tremebunda. Now and per our arrangement, you must bring the amulet to me. Um, I didn't literally mean take her. Please let her go. It's all just a misunderstanding. Hmm, I see. Well, in that case, you have just 24 hours to bring the amulet to me. Or you will never see Tremebunda ever again. Ha, he peed his pants, right? Can someone confirm peepee? Huh? What do you mean we're still on? Yayita. Yayita. Excuse me... My love, can we talk for a second? No. I'm done with your excuses. It's over between us, Condorito. Over? But why? Okay, I guess I know why. But you got to believe me. I thought he was trying to sell me a new wireless plan. I never dreamed your mother would actually be kidnapped by aliens. You've been dreaming about it for years. Yeah. But I'm gonna get her back. I swear. Sure, you swear. My mother was right all along. If only I'd listened to her before you destroyed all our lives. Goodbye, Condorito. Don't go. Yayita. Yayita. There's no need to worry, buddy. I'm sure the authorities will be able to take care of it. Uh-huh. It's a message from the alien. "The amulet is located in Condortihuacan, in a place called The Catacomb of Certain Luck." Really? Well, that sounds easy. Hang on. No, oops. Actually, it's The Catacomb of Certain Death. What do I do? Yayita will never forgive me if I don't save her mother. Please, we ask you to show some respect for what's left of our family in this time of crisis. That conniving buck-toothed lead sack. Chickie, pack up your things, we're going on an adventure. Can I borrow some money? We still don't have enough. - You could go gambling. - Good idea. But I don't think we have enough time to... Hmm. Whoa. It's an adventure. Here you go. This young lady will help, if there's anything you need. - Won't you, my dear? - Ugh. In my time, parents would never even think of letting kids travel by themselves. Yeah, but that's because back in your time, there was only one continent. Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Oh, how about we find you something to play with. Ah, what do we have here? Oh yeah, it's one of those inflatable travel pillows. Now we'll just give it a little twist here. And do this. Here you go. You have a pleasant flight. You're a good boy. It's such a shame that your parents don't love you. You're skin and bones. Don't tell me they don't feed you. Actually, I live with my uncle, but I do all the cooking in our place. Oh. Excuse me, sir. Would you please put this up for me? But of course, madam. Huh? Skis? Who brings skis to Condortihuacan? Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We've reached our cruising altitude of 37,000 feet - and we expect... - Did he do your laundry? Clean out your ears? Take you to the dentist? Is there anything he does do for you? Oh, sure, tons of things. He showed me how to make and football. He should take care of you. Being an adult is a great responsibility. He's responsible. We hope you have pleasant flight to Alaska. Huh? Because that's where this plane is going. What do you mean this flight isn't going to Condortihuacan? I said it's not landing in Condortihuacan. But we still are. Look there. That's Condortihuacan. But that's thousands of feet below. Whoa! Have faith, Chickie. This is all part of a plan. Whoa! Okay, that wasn't part of the plan. It's the only way to fly. What did I tell you? Absolutely nothing to worry about. Something to worry about, something to worry about. But I'm too young to die! Aw, don't be like that. A little twist. Here, have an elephant. Soon I will have that power. But first, it's my lunch time. Prepare to be devoured, lasagna. Where, where's my lunchbox? Computer, where is my lunchbox? I don't know, Your Majesty. Did you check under your seat? It's not under my seat. Come on, guys. I know we talked about this. We'll never manage to re-enslave the universe unless we...? Unless we acknowledge and respect the chain of command. So, let's just try to be respectful of that, okay? Huh? Emperor Molosco, the captive has been secured in the abduction chamber. I'm coming. Where's my lunchbox? Where's my lunchbox? Where's my lunchbox? Huh? Oh, my gods. She's incredible. This specimen's gigantic. She's like a living, breathing planet. I kind of just want to orbit her. Keep your tentacles away from me, you intergalactic pervert! I'm a lady, not a specimen! Wow. - What do we do? - Lower the force field. Hey, hey! I demand that you let me out of here at once! We've lost the chicken. I repeat, we've lost the chicken. - Ma'am, what do we do? - We're going in there. You see? Now that wasn't so bad. Oh, oh. Ugh. - Reflauta. - Ow. You okay? Tio, how come you didn't check where the plane was going? I guess I thought you were on that. But forget it. Come on. We're running out of time. To additional adventure. Poor Condorito. Why couldn't they have just taken my wife instead? All I can say is I hope he has health insurance for The Catacombs of Certain Death. Condorito can take care of himself. It's him we have to worry about. That donkey is going to seduce Yayita while Condorito is away. - It's Pepe's car. - Uh-huh, uh-huh. It's irresistible. Ladies. Aww. Ow. So, it's his car, eh? Well then, it's time for us to level the playing field. - Yes, Coach. - Yes, Coach. Yes, Coach. Let me tell you, if you even think about doing any experiments on me... Actually I was just wondering if you would be my guest for dinner - tonight. - Oh? If you have no other plans. Huh? Sweet baby Jupiter. Whoa. Welcome, my dear. I bet you must be starving. I had my chef prepare something special for a carnivore such as you. Ta-dum, he cooked himself for you. Go on. Dig in and devour Garbaggio. Um, we also have empanadas. I hope you'll excuse me. It's been a while since someone's taken me to dinner. Huh? How can that be for a beauty such as you? Surely you must dine out often with your human male beau. Do you mean Cuasi? For our anniversary dinner, he took me to a drive-thru and forgot me. Ugh. Your male thing, I believe I may have seen him on our Earth cam. Cuasi, but you promised me an exclusive. But why would he want to go with you when he can have me? I know, why don't we all interview him together? Not a bad idea. I just don't get it. Why does your male thing get aroused by those sickly, bony females? Well, because he's an ape. That's why. But they're nothing but skeletons. How can one respect a female who is not even respected by the force of gravity? On my planet, the more gravity you have, the less respect you get. A big woman can't go even a single day without being the butt of some stupid joke, even on my own birthday. I understand what it's like to be mocked. My ancestors ruled the entire universe. But me, I don't even rule the mini fridge on my own spaceship, nothing. But one day soon when I get my hands on the amulet, I'll put them all in their place and once again the iron tentacle shall rule. Then I'll only need one thing to make my life complete. And what's that? The most important thing of all, a queen. Molosco says that only The Featherless Condor can enter the catacombs. Once inside, he'll fight a terrifying guardian. Eh, I don't buy it. Just look at this place, nothing but an old pile of rocks. It's not waiting for... the Great Featherless Condor. Whoever built this place did not have a happy childhood. Maybe the guardian bit the dust, too. I bet he's dead. Oh, he's dead all right. According to the message, the guardian's job is to protect the amulet. Whenever someone sets foot in the dungeon, he rises from the dead to fight them and fulfill his sacred duty. Huh. The guy must be some kind of loser to keep working after death. Grandpa Rito? Oops. Reflauta. Oh, no. Over there. He's coming. Faster, faster. Slower, slower. In your face, great-grandpa. What the? This is very confusing. Look. Now that's just unnecessary. Hold on tight. Uh-oh. Oh. And this is why I hate family reunions. Uh, Tio? No, we haven't received any word yet. I guess we just have to be patient. Come in. It's Uncle Pepe. We wanna play with you. No. Yayita, so good to see you. Sorry, it's not a good time. The boiler broke, the toilets are all clogged. Condorito was supposed to help, but now he's gone. Hey, Ignorancio. - Huh? - The car. Oh, aye, aye. Hey, Coach, it's done. Excellent. Wait. Oh, no, that's my car. Well, at least the roof isn't falling down on our heads. Looks like only an angel could save us now. Oh. Thank you. Thank you. And now I'd like to unveil the Cortisona Orphanage. Wow. It's completely state-of-the-art including an pool, a display for perspective parents, a gym, and of course an on-site dental hygienist for that perfect Cortisona smile. I can't believe it. That jerk's doing charity now? How low can he go? Now, many of you must be wondering, Pepe Cortisona, why are you throwing your money away on something as worthless as needy children? All I can really say is when I looked at these beautiful kids' faces, well, they touched me. They touched me! As I was saying, I also must give credit to the splendiferous headmistress of this wonderful establishment. She showed me that generosity is about more than getting your name on a plaque, even my name. Well, my friends, I'm afraid it's over. Oh. That must be the Amulet of Unlimited Power. Run, Chickie, run. Hurry. Tio, over there. Huh? There. Feel my unlimited power. My power still feels fairly limited. I know, it must be laser vision. Huh? My power is flight. Come on, guys, can't we be friends? Okay. Now, I need some space, guys. Ah, that's it. That's what it does. The Amulet gives you the power to control minds. Oh, time to have some fun now. Tio. Hey, you know, I think you're actually less pale than regular Egghead. Tio, look at this. We have to call the Octopus. No. Uh, uh... Yes. Wait. Huh? What are you doing? If we get the Amulet to Molosco, he'll use it to enslave every planet in the galaxy. Huh? What are you talking about? That's why the guardian hid it here, to stop the Moloscosians. But I promised Yayita. This is the only way to bring her mother back. Think about it. This is the most powerful weapon in the universe. Molosco could even use it here to conquer Earth. Whoa. Look, it's Earth, right? If he goes alphabetically there's A, B, C, and D. It could take centuries before they get here. Tio, if you do this, then billions of creatures will suffer. Protecting them is our responsibility, right? Yeah. We'll find another way. Don't remember any of this. No, Tio, don't do it. Now, you give me back my She-Shrek. No, can do I'm afraid. Treme will be returning for the foreseeable future. But I made a deal with you. The Amulet for Tremebunda. Well, then I guess it sucks to be you or should I say, you to be it sucks? Bye-bye. Come back. You can't do this. I'll sue. Wait. No! Yeah, they're back. Huh? Whoa. I demand an explanation! May I please have your attention? For centuries our people have... oh. Hey. Okay. Will you please shut up?! Now, that's more like it. That's right. I don't even wanna hear you breathing, understood? As I was saying, for centuries we've dreamt of reestablishing our dominion. Today, we have regained the Amulet of Unlimited Power, otherwise known as the Amulet of Unlimited Power. With it, we shall enslave every single planet in the entire galaxy, and we'll go in alphabetical order. Navigator, establish a course for the first planet, A. All hail the Moloscosians. I have some good news and I thought we could celebrate together. Yes, of course. Let me just go freshen up. Get the Navigator. Uh, Your Highness... If your partner harbors feelings for an ex, the best course of action is to enslave him and every other sentient being on his planet, don't you agree, Cosmo? We will return for you later, Planet A. You will obey my command. If this is about stealing the neighbor's Wi-Fi, I can totally explain. - Huh? - Terminated unexpectedly? I'll show you terminated unexpectedly. Where are we? This is the secret headquarters of the International Space Invaders Defense Program. Does anybody have a blank floppy? Ah, I think it's a museum. We, um, had a couple of budget cuts. For years, our unit has been tasked with secretly defending Earth from alien attacks. With what? Pointy sticks? We've faced threats from every corner of the Universe, but none as great as the Moloscosians. They were the cruelest tyrants in the galaxy. And now, they want their title back. Hmm? Luckily, we were prepared. Our operation will vanquish the aliens and, of course, rescue Tremebunda. The important thing is that we found you before you gave Molosco the Amulet. Otherwise, your Treme, along with every other being in the Universe, would be totally and utterly doomed. What? Argh! He gave the Amulet to Molosco. - He what? - I had no choice. I had to do it in order to bring Treme back to my girlfriend or else she'd marry Pepe. I-I didn't know. I thought he was a wireless carrier. Have you any idea what you've done? Well, if they go in alphabetical order, we'll be all right. It's the aliens. We have their trajectory. And they're headed for... Uh, for Earth! Excuse me. No, this is not a good... Why do these things always seem to happen to me? Huh? They don't just happen to you, you made them happen. - Huh? - You never cook, you never do the laundry, and you never clean my ears. And now, you put the whole planet in danger. You're such a nitwit. Chickie, that is no way - to talk to your... - My what? Were you gonna say elder? I'm more elder than you. Do you know why he always wears those flip-flops? It's because he doesn't know how to tie shoelaces. Shh, shh, that was supposed to be our secret. I thought you were so cool, my uncle, the town hero. But real heroes? They go on adventures to save others. The only person you ever worry about is you. I guess you really are just a birdbrain, aren't you? I'm going to my room. I know. It's the other way. Captain Kotori-san, the Sotorions are using the stolen crystal to power the robotic armadillo death ray. Fear not, square tooth, now that I have vowed my inner strength by living up to my responsibilities, I am confident that no enemy will be able to withstand my attack. By the power of friendship. Our only hope is to destroy the alien mother ship before it reaches Earth. I've designed a virus that will cause the core of the mother ship to overheat. However, someone has to go up there to install it manually. - Not it. - Not it. Oh, man. The problem is the amulet will alert Molosco to any approaching foreign intelligence, even yours. Only someone with a nearly undetectable IQ could sneak into that ship, a complete birdbrain, if you will, but where to find such an idiot? Boss, I'm your idiot. The Featherless Condor is immune to the amulet. How do you know that? I, uh... I tried it on my nephew. I know I said idiot, but this is too much, no? Wait, please. I can do it. I do have an iguana that's quite gifted. Okay, Condor. Yeah, take me to my shuttle. Take me to my house. She may not look like much, but boy, can she fly. The shuttle is equipped with an automatic pilot that will handle both the takeoff and landing. Huh? Autopilot, restrain the Captain. Activating restraining system. Once you've completed your mission, all you have to do is say the code word, "Bingo" and the autopilot will take you to Earth. Say it, Bingo. Uh, bingo. Autopilot, release the Captain. Deactivating restraint. What's troubling you? I'm worried that I might, uh... Screw things up? Unfortunately, that is my claim to fame. Here's a tip, to make things easier, don't think about saving the world, it's too big, think about saving those who you love. Keep them in your heart. They'll guide you home. Did someone say the orphanage - needs a new ball? - Mm-hmm. To Condorito! Yayita. Yayita. You see? But you'll probably die anyway. Ground crew, prepare for lift off. Wow, the kids are going to be so happy here. I'd do anything for those sweet little angels. Yayita, there's something I've been meaning to ask you. These last few days together have made me feel things that I've never felt before. Gratitude, empathy. Why, today, I even tried reading a book. I know there's nothing you can't handle on your own, but still I'd do anything for you. Pepe, I'm speechless. It's what your mother would have wanted. No! Oh, God, no, my baby, please say you're not scratched, say you're not scratched. Huh? You get your hands off her, because your Uncle Pepe needs a hug. Huh? This just in. An alien warship is approaching Earth. Sources say the invaders have an entire armada. Apparently, they are the same aliens who had previously abducted Tremebunda, and now they intend to put an end to our civilization. - Treme. - Officials tell us Earth forces are preparing a mission to stop the aliens, a mission being led by... by Pelotillehue midfielder, - Condorito? - Huh? Huh? Well, it looks like we're toast. We take you now live to the launch site. Ten... nine... eight... seven... six... five... five... Lift off. Yeah, it worked! Stop all this shaking, please, autopilot. Stop, autopilot. Stopping autopilot. Manual controls activated. No. What's he doing? Autopilot, which one's the autopilot? - Oh. - It's the big red one. Huh? Activated. Thank you. Chickie? What are you doing here? I couldn't let you do this all alone. But it's too dangerous for you. I know I've been selfish, but there's nothing more important to me than protecting you. Can you forgive me? What did you say? Now let's have an adventure. We're getting close. We're coming up on the... mama mia. Yay. Just how are we supposed to get into that thing? Through there. Eww. Tio, the core of the mother ship should be somewhere beneath you. Copy that. This is one small step for man. I think I found the core. Great. Can you install the virus? I don't know. I've never seen anything like this. Huh? So I guess these things really are universal. Okay. I'm activating the virus. Wait, don't, first we have to save Treme. The virus will overheat the core in minutes. If we activate it now, we will explode along with the ship. Okay. In that case, let's go find her. I'll just get off this thing. Can you guide me to Molosco? That slime ball will know where she is. Uh, I think so. That shaft connects to everywhere. You mean something like a ventilation shaft? Well, not exactly. - Wrong exit. - Sorry, take a left at the next junction. Keep going. - Now where? - Left. - Go up. - What do you mean? No, thank you. Poor Treme, he's conducting an alien experiment on her. A massage? Oh. There's nothing too good - for you, my queen. - Oh, right there, Molly. - Ooh. - Back in college, I was known as... Mr. Magic Puckers. Somebody save me. Tio, what's going on? I think he must be controlling her mind with the amulet. Hold on, Treme, I'm coming. You're amazing. I'm just getting started. My eyes, my eyes. I have to get amulet. Your skin, ooh, it's as smooth as that of a chicken? - I am not a chicken. - Condorito? Since when are you an astronaut? Since when do you have a job? Come on, Treme, - you're free. - I'm free? - Free from what? - The octopus, he can't control your mind anymore. He's not controlling my mind. What are you talking about? But? But? Hah, security, security! We're, uh, watching the game. Arrest this condor. Treme, you really wanna stay here? She belongs here. She's finally the queen she was destined to be. What about your family, Cuasi, Yayita? This crazy lunatic, he's planning to... Feel the iron tentacles' power. Tio? Tio? Answer me. Now, now, come on, fellas, there's really no need for violence. Psst, psst, take the prisoner down to the chamber of violent incineration. What will you do to him? Oh, we'll just send him back to Earth. Why don't you wait right here? Be back in a jiffy. Emperor Molosco, approaching your destination. Enslavement protocol commencing. I really should have gotten her the perfume. With no updates from Condorito, it appears that the world as we know it will soon be coming to an end. In other news, the football season has been cancelled. Don't worry, dear. Condorito is the smartest chicken that I've ever met. I bet that even now he's kicking their alien asses into the next galaxy. ...civilization. Officials tell us Earth will... Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Featherless condor, you are hereby charged with first degree interruption - of a massage. - That's not a thing, you slimy invertebrate. It's not over, you hear me? It's not over. Actually, bird, it is over. Time to say adieu. Now, prepare to be incinerated. You, too. Turn up the barbeque! Chickie. Come in, Chickie. Tio, where are you? Chickie, you need to get out of the mother ship. Hold on, I've got your signal. On my way. Let's go! No, there isn't enough time. I activated the virus. The whole ship is going to explode. Just turn around and go home. Please, save yourself while you can. But I can rescue you. Chickie, listen to me, in my whole life, I never sacrificed anything for the people I love, you, Yayita, everyone. Maybe this is my opportunity to make up for all that. But what about you? Bingo. Auto return sequence initiated. What's going on? It's all right. - You'll be safe now. - Tio. No. Tell Yayita... I love her. Tio. Hey, have some adventures for me. Anyone want some fries with their condor nuggets? Hold all my calls. I'm going to celebrate with my empress. But my Lord, the invasion starts in 20 minutes. That's all right. I'm only going to need four. Huh? Take me home. So where's your ship? I sent it back to earth. Wait. - What? - Chickie was on it. That was the only way to make sure he got home safe. Chickie? Well, then exactly how are we supposed to get home? Uh, Uber? How about the escape pods? - Where are they? - Top floor. Hurry up. Hurry, hurry, hurry! What's your problem? Oh, right. I forgot to tell you. Promise you won't get mad? Mi amor, come and get your emperor. Huh? I'll be back soon. Why don't you just wait right here for me, winky smoochy face. Oh, mamacita! This whole ship's gonna blow?! You promised you wouldn't get mad! ♪ Where, where's my lunchbox? ♪ ♪ Lunch, lunchbox, where's my, my lunchbox ♪ ♪ Where's my lunch, lunch, lunchbox? ♪ ♪ Where's my lunch, computer? ♪ ♪ Where's my lunch, lunch, lunchbox? ♪ ♪ Computer, lunchbox? ♪ Huh? Your Majesty. The escape pods. We just need to get to them without causing a panic. Panic, panic, floor overheating. Total devastation in five minutes. This is just a drill. This is not a drill. Well, at least there are plenty of escape pods. No, there aren't. Run, birdbrain, run! That robot is a chicken! Ahh. Ooh. Why yes, I have been working out. How dare you barge in on me? But my Lord, I didn't mean to. Slap yourself in the face at once. My Lord, it's... an emergency! - Ow! - Huh? Majesty, step away from the chicken - or we will shoot! - Get us out of here! Here goes nothing! Kiss my feathers. Well, I didn't see that coming. Any other ideas? I do have one. Nice. Now let's get out of here. Computer, where's our escape pod? Son of a... That tickles, I'm stuck in something. Inhale. It's all my fault. I should've left when you first said to leave. No, you're here because of me. It's my fault. I'm sorry. Did you throw up in here? Ugh. - What's that? - Hey, anybody need a ride? Chickie? But how? I ejected the pilot. Chickie, you have to rescue us. The mother ship is going to explode. Already on it. Now tell me that's not the most beautiful sight ever. - Huh? - Do not put your faith in beauty... because beauty lies. Let go of us. I would've given you everything. Believe me, I would rather die than be with a monster like you. Then here's your wish. Chickie. Chickie, are you all right? Yeah. Just a little dizzy. You twisted maniac. You're wasting your time. Nice shot. Now let's finish this. Whoa. Stop, just wait. Huh, now you're really twisted. Enough, Tremebunda, remove your helmet now. No, don't do it. Don't listen to him. Get off of me, bird boy. Tell Treme to stop. No, Treme. Give it up, kid. My security code is unbreakable. Is it circle, triangle, squiggle face, spider? - How did you know that? - There's a post-it. No, no, no, no, no, no, Mommy. Oh. Huh? - What happened? - It's no biggie. You just tried to kill us but it's all good. You both are already dead. Good luck outrunning that, birdbrain. What are you looking at me for? No. This is an executive pod. You're getting space everywhere. Hmm. Huh? Tio, I'm scared. It's gonna be all right. Look, it's Pelotillehue. Our inertial dampeners are down to two percent. Can you land this thing? Maybe, but where? I want you to cancel the orphanage and get me a first-class ticket to Mars now! Huh? Amigos! - Look over here! - No! Not the car! No! My baby! Please! Ha! You missed me! Yeah! We can now officially confirm that Earth and with it, the rest of the football season has been saved! My darling, I thought I lost you forever. You should be so lucky. Oh, Mom. Condorito! You're back! - Hey, guys. - Did you get us anything? Of course I did. Who wants to play with an alien artifact? It's confirmed, ma'am. The mothership has been completely destroyed. And the amulet? There's no trace of it on the scan. - Professor? - Yay! Finally, a real alien to dissect! Dissect?! These tentacles are fascinating. Hmm. That one isn't a tentacle. Where you going? You were right. Yayita deserves a prince, not a birdbrain. Yes, but sometimes even a birdbrain can be a prince. Go to her, you nitwit. Yayita, I just wanted to say if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have made it back. You were the light that guided me home. Aww. I know I don't have much, but... Yayita... will you marry me? Aww. - No. - Aww. Huh? Condorito, you know how much you mean to me but it's just too soon for us to get married. I'm not ready. So that means there's no wedding? The only thing I want from you is right here. You are the most amazing woman in the universe! Woo-hoo! Pepe! Pepe! Pepe! Pepe! Thank you, thank you. Now, many of you must be wondering, Pepe Cortisona, why are you throwing your money away on something as worthless as needy children? Well, all I can say is... I have the butt of a donkey. Uh, excuse me. What I meant to say is... Honey, don't you think you've punished Pepe enough? Not really. Here you go. Yes, yes, don't worry. I'll add you on WhatsApp. What's going on? Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh, please. Tell me I did not pay for all of this. Lead Sack, you've been very generous. And in return, the kids have done something for you. They all worked together to repair... your beloved... automobile. Whee, whee. Uh, I guess it's now more of an auto-immobile. Subtitles by explosiveskull Sync by Bargain
