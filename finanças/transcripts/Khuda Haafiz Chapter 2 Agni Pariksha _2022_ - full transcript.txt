No! No! No! No! No! No, please! -[Speaking in Arabic] -Let me go, please. [Speaking in Arabic] -[Speaking in Arabic] -Please, I beg. Please don't make me do this. No, please. Please, no. I beg you. Please! Please! Happy Anniversary! There was no need to do all this. And... I am in no mood for breakfast now. We'll be late for the doctor's appointment. Hello. So how was last week, Nargis? The new medicines I prescribed, is it working for you? Is it making you a little better? Yes. Little better. Nice. Nice. And, Sameer, tell me, how was last week for both of you? It was okay. I mean, we're trying... But it's all going good. What good? Why are you lying? Nothing is good. Doctor, everything is still the same. And... I don't know who is it going good for. For the people, you've become that incarnation of Sri Ram (saviour), who saved his Sita. And my image has become like Sita. The only difference is, I've to give a trial every day. Sita successfully passed her trial, but not me. Every lane, every block, every neighbourhood I go to, everyone knows that I am the one who was abducted on foreign soil. And do you know what happened? You know it, right? Doctor, I've changed three jobs so far. But each one of them keeps reminding them with their sympathy, that I was raped... I can't stop thinking about those days when, not once, but I was raped several times. Sameer. Frankly speaking, doctor, I sympathise with myself, with my rotten luck. But I also sympathise with him. Because... he's living with a lifeless body. He should marry someone else, because I am not worthy to be with anyone, let alone him. Enough, Nargis. Remember what we talked about. You're not the victim of your circumstances, you're a fighter. Sameer, can you wait outside for a while. I just need some alone time with her, please. "There's a mist spread in every direction." "Can't seem to find Your traces," "yet everywhere I look, I see You." "There's a mist spread in every direction." "Can't seem to find Your traces," "yet everywhere I look, I see You." "I am Your preacher," "uphold my honour." "O Benefactor of the doomed, I've small desire." "You be by me, I be by you." "You be by me, I be by you." "You be by me, I be by you." Doctor, do you think if Nargis and I try for a child, will everything be all right again? I can understand your desire for a child. But the medication Nargis is on for depression, are pretty strong. In these circumstances, getting pregnant is medically not advisable for her. "Make these crazy winds stop." "Don't destroy what You created." "If I give up, so do you." "Don't let me give up..." "Be one with me and give me strength," "so I can return your grace." "I am the hazy sunset, and you're like the dawn." "O Benefactor of the doomed, I've small desire." "You be by me, I be by you." "You be by me, I be by you." "You be by me, I be by you." "Come to me, beloved." "Understand my love." "The flames of love is making me pine." "You dwell in every inch of me, my heart is no longer in control." "You're the keeper of my heart, my love, you should know." "You be by me, I be by you." "You be by me, I be by you." "You be by me," "I be by you." Can I light it? She is my niece. My brother and sister-in-law's last memorabilia. I don't know, when my life's dreams deserted me. Let alone dreams... Getting a decent paying job, is as tough as getting selected for the Indian cricket team. And now little Nandini's responsibilities. I don't know how I'm going to look after her. I am a travelling salesman. Do I take the child all over the country with me? Does she have no one on her mother's side, who can look after her? Hard to believe, isn't it? I talked to Nandini's uncle. He said, it's a big deal we attended their funeral. I've decided... Maybe an orphanage, adoption agency, or an NGO. I can't take care of her. I don't know whether this will work or not. We can keep Nandini with us for a week. I mean, Nargis and me. And if Nandini likes Nargis, and Nargis like Nandini... Then, the three of us can live together. Maybe we can even adopt her. We should give it a try. We should try. Come on. Come on. Come on. This is our new home. See, Nandini. That's your Nargis aunt. Who is she? Wait here, Nandini. Remember my friend Deepak, whose brother and sister-in-law passed away. She is his niece. He requested if we could keep her for a week. He is travelling out of town for urgent work. Where is she going to sleep? I was thinking with you, on your bed... Absolutely not. Your mom and dad's room is vacant. She can sleep in there. Isn't that great? Do you know what aunty said? She said we'll be giving you your own big room. Oh, God. See what a big room this is. And this is our bed. We'll need to clean the place up first. Come on. I'll make some tea, sister. Brother made breakfast for the child in the morning. What do I make for her now? Where is she? Sister, what do I make for the child? She will eat whatever is cooked. Sister, she is just a child. She can't eat the spicy food that you eat. Then ask the one who brought her here. You don't have to hide your face anymore. You said she is going to stay with us for a week. You didn't say I'll have to look after her all day. I am not ready for this responsibility, Sameer. I see... so there you are. Look, what I got for you. Don't want it. I've got another thing for you. Very good. That child makes me furious. Not on her but on my luck. Doctor. This should have been my child. When I married Sameer, I had certain desires. To start my own family, to have my own child. By bringing this child home, and keeping her in front of my sight, I don't know how I should react. I'm unable to take care of myself properly, how can I... Sorry, doctor. It's okay. It's just broken. Do you know, Nargis, the Japanese closely follow a philosophy in their life. When something is broken... Like this plate. They don't throw it away. Do you know what they do with it? They put it back together, using gold, brass, or silver. The Japanese call it the 'Kintsugi' philosophy. They believe hardships are a part of life, they shatter a human being, shake our belief. But a shattered life doesn't mean we put an end to it. We can put it back together. Piece by piece. One day at a time. Nandini is broken like you. She's going through trauma as well. Maybe, it's God's way of bringing two people together who are broken. Nargis, life is invaluable. It's not just for surviving, you got to live it. With all the broken pieces. Sister, I am leaving. Do you want to go out and play? Then go. 'Nandini is broken like you.' 'She's going through a trauma as well.' 'Maybe, it's God's way of bringing two people together who are broken.' Mummy. Nandini! Mummy. -Leave her. -Mummy. Leave her. Leave her. -Get lost. Leave her. -Mummy. Nandini! -Get up. -Mummy. Mummy. Mummy. Leave me. I didn't want to call you up and bother you. One of the neighbour's dogs attacked Nandini. -Nandini... -She's... here with me. Did he bite you too? Yes, what to do? I'll be fine soon. Good girl. Good girl. One last. Come on, child, one last. Last one, child. Last one, child. Good girl. -Good morning. -Morning. There's hot tea in the hot cup. Do you want some? -Does it hurt? -Not so much. Deepak is coming over in the evening, to take Nandini back. I didn't realise one week had passed. He said he had good news. He's found a nice family who wants to adopt her. I'll be right back. I was thinking of resuming my job. We'll have additional expenses... Why will we have additional expenses? I... I mean... Can we adopt Nandini? As for my parents, I can ask for their permission. And I am sure I can manage between, Nandini's school and my job. If you feel it's right. Both of us, I mean. Let's ask Nandini what she wants. Come on. Nandini. Child, we wanted to ask, would you like to stay with us? Forever? "You had me so hooked on to you... " "You had me so hooked on to you... " "Couldn't stop falling in love with you." "Your eyes urge me to come closer." "Your eyes urge me to come closer." "Here I am... " "In the shade of your love, sweetheart." "In the shade of your love, sweetheart." "In the shade of your love, sweetheart." "In the shade of your love, sweetheart." "Treat me like this always." "Treat me like this always." "In the shade of your love, sweetheart." "In the shade of your love, sweetheart." "Beloved... " "I can spend a lifetime" "for the sake of your love." "My eyes were yearning to see the glow on your face." "This glow... " "My eyes were yearning to see the glow on your face." "The Lord has brought us back together again, so why stay apart?" "Your eyes urge me to come closer." "Your eyes urge me to come closer." "Here I am... " "In the shade of your love, sweetheart." "In the shade of your love, sweetheart." "In the shade of your love, sweetheart." "In the shade of your love, sweetheart." "Never change my love." "Never change my love." "In the shade of your love, sweetheart." "In the shade of your love, sweetheart." "He's my benefactor, my honour." "I bow before him." "Every breath I take, everything I do." "Says I'm in love with you." "He's my benefactor, my honour." "I bow before him." "Every breath I take, everything I do." "Says I'm in love with you." "In the shade of your love, sweetheart." "In the shade of your love, sweetheart." "In the shade of your love, sweetheart." "Sweetheart." "Sweetheart." Bye, Myra. Bye. -Hi, sweetheart. -Hi, sister Seema. Hasn't the Rickshaw guy shown up yet? No. -Want an ice cream? -Yes. Only if my tongue doesn't turn orange. Otherwise, mummy will know. -Okay. Then vanilla. -Yes. Come on. -Uncle, two vanilla cones. -Yes. Here you go. Give me a chance to buy you ice cream. Sister. -Leave me. -Sister. -Move! -Let my sister go. -Let her go. -Leave me. -Leave her. -Come on. -Leave her. -Get lost. -Get rid of her! -Let my sister go. -Let her go. Let my sister go. Sister, -Leave them. Let the children go! -What are you doing? -Listen to me. -But... -Listen, uncle, stay back. Otherwise, you'll be chewing on bullets, not ice cream. -Let her go. -What are you doing with her? -Quiet! -Let the child go. You're asking for trouble. Leave me. -Start the car. -Leave me. -Are you gone mad? -Start the car. Hurry up. -Leave me. -Start the car. Get in. Come on. -Hello. -'Mr. Sameer Chaudhary.' Speaking. 'I am calling from the school, from the principal's office.' 'Please come down to the school immediately.' What's the matter, madam? Is Nandini all right? 'Please come quickly. It's an emergency.' 'Hello. Are you there?' Please tell me everything clearly. 'Your daughter Nandini, has been kidnapped from outside the school.' 'Hello? Mr. Sameer?' 'Mr. Sameer?' 'Can you hear me?' -I've called him. -Yes, ma'am. Ma'am... I am Sameer Chaudhary. You called about Nandini, my daughter... What happened? Yes, Mr. Sameer. That's why we called the police. He sells ice cream outside the school. He saw it happen. 'Control room, police is at every checkpost.' Uncle, that little girl Nandini... Did you see where they went, what happened? Son, three boys arrived in a car. There was an older girl. That's her brother and mother. They forcefully abducted both the girls. I tried. But they pointed a gun at me. -Gun? -Threatened to shoot me. I told sir everything. -The car's number plate or the colour... -Not a car, it was a van. Blue colour. Number 8. The first number was 8. My eyesight is weak. I told sir everything. -No. -Sir... Sameer Chaudhary. The little girl Nandini's father. -Isn't there a little girl too? -Yes, sir. Odd. I'm confused why they abducted your daughter. Come with us. Follow us to the police station. We can investigate properly from there. Come on. Let me go. Please. Please let me go. It's all right... Good girls don't cry. You return the gifts I send, don't give me your number when I ask. You don't come when I call. Who is better than me in the entire school? I am not that type. What type aren't you? It's okay. It's okay. -I want to go to my mom. -Yes. Why did you drag her too? What could I do? She and your girl were inseparable! What else could I do? They were screaming so loud. Did you want me to ask politely? Please... Please let her go. Please let her go. Hello. Hi, Mishra. How are you? 'I am good. Are you in Lucknow or Delhi?' I am in Lucknow for a few days. What's wrong? You sound worried. Ravi, there's been a kidnapping. I want you to give media coverage. Just yesterday, I read about four kidnappings, in the newspaper. Here in Lucknow. You didn't tell me about those. What's so special about this one? Ravi, they are minors. They were abducted from their school an hour ago. We even have an eye-witness. One of them is15, and the other one is just 5-years-old. 5-years-old? Can you give me any details, like the car's number or colour? Have some tea. Sir, the eye-witness clearly said, the boys were wearing full pants. And only boys from classes 10 to 12 wear full pants in school. We can get the numbers from the school, and ask their parents who owns a blue van. We can find out everything within an hour. Look. I've sent an alert all over the city. Lucknow Police is looking for the van at every checkpost. They will find the van before you make the calls. But the van doesn't necessarily be on the road. It could be hidden. It's important to take some kind of action! What did you say your name was? Yes. Sameer. Mr. Sameer, I said I sent an alert on the wireless all over the city. I know how to crack this. Don't worry. Have patience. You're telling me to be patient. Can't you see this is a clear case of kidnapping? Are you trying to teach me my job? I am not teaching you your job, I am implying you take action. You're a public servant, aren't you? So help the public. Before anything happens to our children, do something, sir. Sit outside. Don't lecture me. Otherwise... you can mess it up. I am not going anywhere, until you don't file an FIR. There will be no FIR until 12 hours haven't passed, and we don't finish our investigation. If anything happens to my daughter, I will destroy your life. Hey... I've had enough of you. You're threatening an SO. I ruin your life! Let's go. Let's go outside, please. Otherwise, this can turn ugly. Things can get worse. -Take him away, Mr. Mishra. -Come, please. Hello. Sameer, Nandini hasn't returned home yet. And the Rickshaw guy's phone is unreachable. Can you call him up and ask him... Oh, sorry. Sorry, sorry. I forgot to tell you. Deepak was in Lucknow. He said, he'll take Nandini sightseeing, and drop him home at night. Otherwise, I'll pick her up at night. Fine, Nandini's food... When are you guys coming over? Sameer? I got a new job. I'll be late. Uncle, can you do me a favour? Can you show me which direction did the van go from the school? Yes. Yes. -Can you show me? -Come with me. There are no turns till here from school. Let's stop at the crossroads and take a look. Come, uncle. Hello, mister. My name is Sameer. My daughter was abducted from LPU School. I mean, she was kidnapped. Uncle here is an eye-witness. It was a blue colour van, that passed by here. You've a road-facing CCTV camera. Please can you show me the footage? Go get the police first, mister. How can I show you the footage like this? The police have already wasted a lot of time. I want my daughter back at any cost. Every minute is important. If you're a father, then please help me for that sake. Okay, fine. -What time? -1 o'clock. 1 o'clock meaning takes around 4-5 minutes to get here. The footage from 1:05 pm or 1:06 pm. That... blue van. -This one. -Pause it. This road connects with the road to Maliyabad ahead. Outside the city. You always bring bad news, Tyagi. This is trouble. I'll have to give this bad news to Thakur ma'am personally. Hello. Where are you, Shailendra? At the farmhouse, with Bacchu and two of his friends. They are partying. Rascal... lying to me. What stupidity did you do at school today? I haven't done anything, ma'am. I didn't do anything, in fact, I tried to stop them. But Bacchu was in a fit of rage. He abducted the girls, ma'am. How old are they? One of them is 15, and the other is 5. Now be honest with me. What did those boys do? They raped... both the girls, ma'am! Stay there. Don't budge. I am sending Rashid over. Call Rashid. Make a betel leaf. Wash your hands first. Boss... Thakur ma'am. Move this. Greetings, ma'am. God bless you. Come over to the manor. Yes, right away. -Hashim. -Yes, sir. -Bring the car around quickly. -Yes. Why... Why are you hitting me? Why did you tell my grandma? Rascal, how dare you rat on me. Why would I rat you out? She already knew. Hey, what are you doing? -No. -Come on. Come on. Greetings, ma'am. Those two girls... Finish them off properly. And dispose of them separately. It will be done. And those two other boys with Bacchu, don't let them go anywhere. If they get nervous and spill out something, then Bacchu will get in trouble. In the meanwhile, until things don't cool down, keep them with you. Bacchu too. Safe. It will be done. See you. 'Two girls were abducted in the afternoon,' 'from in front of a school in Lucknow.' The police are still clueless by evening. Even though there's an eye-witness to the crime, the police haven't registered an FIR yet. We, the people, want to know, why the Gomti Nagar police are still sitting idle. Is some powerful entity's son or grandson involved in this incident? What do we do with them, Bacchu? Bacchu... Please... let me go. I won't tell anyone anything. Please, let me go. Please. 'Hello.' Where are you, swine? 'I was... ' A**** we've been searching for an hour. Why aren't you at the farmhouse? 'Bacchu is with me. So I did as he told me.' Tell Bacchu... I've been sent to handle this matter. And quietly tell me where you are. We'll be entering the back roads soon. Stay there. Stay there on the road. I am coming. If you make a move, I'll chop you to pieces and feed you to the dog. Understood. What happened there? Someone set a car on fire in the fields. The car even blew up. The farmers are mad. That's the car! That's the one, son! Throw some mud. Help me. My daughter's inside. Help me. Throw some soil. -Help us. -Throw soil. Throw soil. Come on. Come on. Throw soil. Son, there are no bodies in the car. It's empty. The children are not in it. Someone put out the fire. Come on. It's empty. Where is my child? Where is my child? -Put out the fire. Come on. -Help us find the children. -Tell your men. -Put out the fire. Guys, help them find the children. Take the torches and come with me. -Find the children. -Come on. They are headed in the direction, where we disposed of the girls. A**** why didn't you burn them along with the car? The car was in Kamlesh sir's name. And Bacchu had already taken the girls out, there were several clues in the car. I thought of setting the car ablaze, and... Idiot. Thakur ma'am has already filed a report with the police, claiming that the car was stolen 10-days-ago. Stupid. This matter is out of our hands now. Hashim. Start the cars, and turn off the headlights. And the boys, boss? Our place. There's the girl. Check her pulse. The girl is still alive, but she is unconscious. There comes the police vehicle, uncle. Its coming. Pick her up. -Pick her up. Pick her up. -Be careful. Take the girl carefully. Uncle. You take her. -I've to look for my child. -Okay, fine. -Take her to the hospital. -Lift her up. Drive faster. Take the next left. Perehta village. Okay. Nandini. Nandini. Nandini. Nandini. Nandini. My child. Good Lord! Mister. Hey, mister. Ambulance! Stop! Hey, mister. 'You're watching Pravin Hasya's live report.' 'A couple of villagers, found a girl in the fields,' 'who appears to be in a serious condition.' 'And we see several people running toward us with the child in hand.' 'As you can see...' Start the car. As you can see, we're present at the Wajid Ali Shah hospital. Both the kids are being treated inside. Their condition is serious. I think I know who did this. Once Seema and Nandini are conscious again. What do you mean by you know who did it? Don't be scared. He used to chase Seema. He would follow her all the way home. The blue van belongs to him. I've seen it outside my house. Who is he? Who is he? Bacchu. Basheshwar Thakur. He's their senior at school. Mom and I even complained to the principal. But no one took any action. Why didn't you tell the police? What was I going to tell him? You've no clue what inspector Tyagi said to me. He said, that the van was reported stolen a couple of days ago. It's all a lie. No one's going to take any action against Thakur. She is very powerful. Who is this Thakur? Look. She is Thakur. And that's Basheshwar Thakur. Her grandson. Nandini! I am sorry, Mr. Sameer. We couldn't save your daughter. Hello, this is Ravi Kumar. India lost yet again. No, I am not talking about the India vs Australia match. This great country, known for its culture and democracy worldwide. I am talking about this great country that is India. But are we still a great country? We once used to be. Great people. Great country. Where is that culture lost now? The wisdom, the respect, the honour which elders taught us? The utopia where children, elders and women felt safe? Even Lord Ram must be wondering, is this the same land where my history took root. What does mother Sita say to Him, when she sees humans turning into monsters? Even I am tired, like you, watching this every week. But I cannot be emotional. Yes... I do get tired, and often give up. But I must fight. As Ram fought with Ravan. As patriots fought with the British. Imagine. If this girl, this woman, were members of your family. Would you still change the channel? Would you do nothing? Awaken the Ram in you. Explore his characters in you. Modest with the weak, respect for women and elders, and patience with the young. I am tired but have not given up. Jai Hind. "Thou art the ruler of the minds of all people." "Dispenser of India's destiny." You and I will no longer be the same. Nor will we be the same. Nothing between us will be like it used to be. -So why stay together. -Nargis... Until the rapists of my child, don't die, obliterated, hanged on the noose. Don't show me your face. "O estranged one..." "why are you leaving me alone?" "Tell me now." "Tell me now." "If love is God," "then why separate from me." "Tell me now." "Tell me now." "Show me the way, or turn me into grains of sand." "So I can dispel this despair." "Come back." "Come back." "Don't go." "Don't go." Why didn't you call this boy for interrogation? Sir, I've already explained to him... Look. The van was stolen six days prior to the incident. On what basis do we call that minor? Then call Shivram. He's the eyewitness to this case. He will identify the boy. The ice-cream seller, sir. He's nowhere to be found. The eyewitness to such a crucial case, has been missing for a month. And he let him go missing. Watch your tongue! -What do you mean? -Tyagi! -Sir... -He isn't wrong. You haven't collected a single clue yet. And the main witness of the case is missing. What are you going to say in court? Sameer... I got it, sir. See you. Morning 9 o'clock, okay. -Who are you? How did you get in? -What are you doing? -Let him go! Let him go. -What are you doing? -Let him go! -Go. -No. -Go inside. -No. No. -Go, you crazy woman! I've had enough of your drama. Who else was with Basheshwar Thakur? What happened to the ice cream seller? If you lie again, I'll break your head into pieces. -No, I am telling you. I am telling you! -Come on, tell. Look, I don't know who else was with Bacchu. Honestly. And the ice-cream seller... You'll never find him again. Thakur ma'am has already gotten rid of him. You cannot lay a finger on Thakur ma'am. The case will drag on, and you will suffer like this. Think of it as a bad memory and forget it. She was not... I mean, she wasn't your own daughter. She was adopted anyway. Adopt someone else. Look. Thakur ma'am will easily pay you a couple of million rupees. Take the money and adopt someone else. But this time, adopt a boy. Because these bloody girls only bring a bad reputation. Scoundrel. I'm giving him 60-days of jail sentence. My lord, he assaulted a public servant. We demand one-year jail term, my lord. Your client was the investigating officer. He couldn't serve the public on this case. So-called public servant. Mr. Chaudhary, I am really sorry for your loss. But... upholding the law is necessary. Process for central jail, please. What have you done? Got a cigarette, boy? Talha... This is Sameer. The warden has allotted him this barrack. Come on. Get in. Come on. See you. Okay. You can't tell us where the kids are. At least I must speak to my son right now. No... No one can speak with their kids right now, sir. But... Don't I have any reputation in your view? Your reputation won't save your kid. I will. Can you do better than me? The father of that little girl... He's raising hell. He beat up a police officer. He's getting the public's sympathy. I'll have to shut him up too. Thakur ma'am, only you can handle this matter. Okay. Then you gentlemen can leave. The flames are too close to my house. I cannot leave any loose ends. Kill the father in jail. It will be done. See you. Can you massage my back? Turn off the lights. Boss. Betel leaf. Boss, piece of news for us... Stay away from the new guest. Jaiswal's gang have sent a message. They will show him their hospitality tomorrow. And boss, the most important piece of news is... Rashid the Butcher ordered the hit on him. I heard what happened with you. It's sad. An inmate called Jaiswal, will come tomorrow to kill you. My arch enemy Rashid Qasai ordered the hit. Every prisoner in this jail, is a hardcore criminal. Me too! But after the feat you pulled off, you've become the biggest celebrity in this jail. Because you assaulted a police SHO in his house. These cops... they all hate you. And thanks to them, the most deranged criminal in this jail, wants to kill you. Look, Sameer. Jaiswal gang and my gang have a pact. I cannot help you openly. But yes... you can help yourself. If you survive the Jaiswal gang, I will find out what Rashid Qasai's angle is. But if you kill Jaiswal, then you're a brave heart. It's a long night, and the path's difficult. Goodnight, Sameer. -Greetings, boss. -Greetings, boss. Boss. Boss. Lock the place down. I will feast on his meat tonight. Come on. Come on. Open the door! Open it. Sir! Open the door! Sir. The pact is over! Move! Move! Kill him! Kill him! Sameer kill him! Don't spare him. Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Sameer! Kill him! Kill him! Sameer! Kill him! 'The LPS Rape and Murder case,' 'has now been handed over to senior IPS officer Avinash Thakur.' 'The main eyewitness and rape victim' 'woke up from a coma after two months,' 'and revealed the names of her culprits in her statement to the magistrate.' 'We hope the culprits will finally be apprehended.' 'The names of the boys are Abhinav Kanauj, age 18.' 'Shardul Gupta, age 18.' 'Shailendra Thakur, who has been identified' 'as the driver of the car, that was used in the crime.' 'And the main accused,' 'whose name we cannot disclose here, age 17 years only.' 'See you on Hindustan News after a small break.' Open the door! Open the door! You? Sheela Thakur. Yes, I know. Come in. What would you like to have? Tea? Milk. Without sugar. Cold and raw. I want to meet your daughter. I see. I'll call her right away. Is the milk ready? I... Yes. I'll get it right away. I heard you got raped on foreign soil. These men... I've seen the world. That's why I've a piece of advice for you. Tell your husband to spend his days quietly in jail. And even after he's released, don't waste his time on the case. What's done is done. Try to get over it. Live peacefully. This is important for you as well. Your daughter is dead. If something happens to your husband, then what will you do? You're right. I was raped by half a dozen men in a day. One after another. Every day for weeks. When they couldn't break me, why should I be scared of you and the men of your family? And as for Sameer, if anything happens to him. It doesn't matter. I am still alive. I will deal with it. You are beautiful. Be careful when you step out. What if someone throws something on your face? Is the news verified, uncle? A Brahmin woman, sending food to butcher lane every day from her home. Isn't it obvious? She's sending it for her grandson. Now listen to me. Allah has sent a friend to help us. He will lead all of you in my place. Why do you trust him so much? He's an ordinary man... Remember Jaiswal, uncle. The boy killed Jaiswal singlehandedly. You didn't see what I saw, uncle. I felt it around him. And listen, uncle. When a man is forced to a point, where he doesn't care about the consequences anymore. These ordinary people become leaders of tomorrow. [Sanskrit shlok] This is the best opportunity for us and you. According to my theory, those four boys are still there. My family will give you their full support. Infiltrate. God is your benefactor. Goodbye. Sameer. Sameer. Thank you. Goodbye, Take care. -Good bye. -Good bye. Bye, Sameer. Thank you. He's got an army in the entire butcher lane. Qasai won't think twice before giving his life or taking yours. Give it a second thought, Sameer. All is not lost yet. What if bloodshed might change your mind? As the saying goes, Badar, making someone suffer and suffering is a crime. We'll deal with whatever happens tomorrow. Fine. Tomorrow is Moharram. Dedicated to Hussain. "Blood coursing through my veins." "Making me restless." "My burning heart's filled with rage." "This is a righteous war against injustice." "My sword has tasted blood." "The storm is raging to decimate the enemy." "He's the light of Lord's eye, calmness of the prophet."

"It's the call for war, he's overcome with rage." "Not afraid to shed," -"his blood cries aloud." -Where are the boys? "My blood's raging to challenge an entire army." "Passion, my heart's filled with passion." "My blood's raging to challenge an entire army." "Passion, my heart's filled with passion." -Name? -Shailendra. Abhinav. Where are the other two? I don't know. I don't... I mean... I woke up a few days ago... a couple of weeks ago, they weren't there. And this was his plan anyway. I... No one except for Thakur would know where Bacchu is. Sir, you won't be wrong if you kill me. I am a coward. I watched these boys do such disgusting things, and couldn't do a thing. I have a wife. She's pregnant. I am a poor man, sir. If you spare my life, I'm willing to testify. My sister has revealed your names. We don't need any more witnesses. Against the Thakur. She gave the orders to kill the girls involved in this case. She gave the orders to Rashid. He kept us hidden so long on her orders. Made Bacchu disappear. I know several more secrets with evidence. We are related, but she treats me like a servant. I will testify against these three as well. How Bacchu chased after the girls in this very field with a bat and killed them. Shut up, rascal! Shit up! Shardul and that Bacchu, turn by turn raped that older girl Seema. And this scoundrel didn't spare that little girl either! Quiet! Quiet! He is lying. I didn't do anything. It was Bacchu's plan all along. He is lying. I haven't done anything. He... he's... lying... It was Bacchu... Bacchu... The Police recently found the dead body, of Abhinav Kanauj, one of the main accused in the LPS rape and murder case, hanging from a tree. And the second accused Shardul Gupta surrendered himself today to megistrate. But two accused are still runaway. This is a new aspect that he has to investigate. But what's worth noticing, is Abhinav's gruesome death the result of angst and frustration, that's growing towards the weakness of the system. Check in that room. There is nothing here, sir. Check on the terrace. We did, sir. There is no one here. Check properly. Yes, son? What will you do now, mother? The police know it's Bacchu. Check it here. Remember when I killed your father, Kammo. How you snatched the knife from my hands? What else could I do? The police were on our doorsteps. Why weren't you scared then? I was mature enough even back then, mom. I was sentenced to only two years. By the way, mom, if Bacchu surrenders, even he would... No, Kammo. Don't say it again. No one from my family will ever go to jail again. That's why I sent you abroad. Far away... So you never have to go to jail again. Thanks to your grace and blessings, mom. As long as your mom is alive, fear no one, son. Greetings, sir. Sameer. SSP sir. Sir... That's your guy, sir. Okay, confirm sir. He will give you every little detail on Thakur. Evidence of land grabbing, locations of her illegal wealth, the murders done on her bidding. He will become the approver on this case. A gift for you. The entire report on Basheshwar Thakur. I had to get clearance from three ministries, to get all the information. At the moment Basheshwar Thakur is with his fugitive father Kamlesh Thakur in Egypt. Some local gangster Tabish Haji, under his refuge. We don't have international jurisdiction for Egypt. And no extradition treaty either. I've requested the ministry of external affairs, to have a word with Egypt's foreign ministry. Even if our request is accepted, the paperwork will take months. And that's a hurdle for my department. There are no restrictions for you. Basheshwar is out there, and you've already given three people what they deserved. Sir... Why are you helping me? Even I have a daughter. Don't spare him. Sameer, Egypt is already a centre of chaos. Not to mention gangster Tabish Haji. How are you two going to do it? Sameer... I mean it when I say this, that you're going to need me and Junaid. And what if something happens here? Who will protect your families? I trust you and Badar will do it. Sameer, sister-in-law Nargis is here to see you. "O estranged one... " "why are you leaving me alone." "Tell me now." "Tell me now." "If love is God, then why separate from me." "Tell me now." "Tell me now." "Show me the way, or turn me into grains of sand." "So I can dispel this despair." "Come back." "Come back." "Don't go." "Come back." Only one left. I am leaving tomorrow. I know. Don't go. I am no longer the man you used to be with. I will wait. For this new man to return. "Come back." "Don't go." "Don't go. Come back." "Ram wanders in the jungle, cannot handle this separation." "How can the Lord stay away from his Sita?" "Ram wanders in the jungle, cannot handle this separation." Greetings. Welcome to Egypt. Come on in. "How can the Lord stay away from his Sita?" "Come back." They say a good cab driver knows everything about the city. Yeah. We're looking for a gun. Can you help us find one? We'll pay you 100 dollars. 100 dollars. For 100 dollars, I'll ride this cab on the Nile like a boat. Yeah. Like a boat, man. [Arabic song] [Arabic song] [Arabic song] Okay, this is the area.

We know his son is in india for sure. They've hired 15-20 local boys for your security. Most of the house occupants are up till late. All in all, the best time to attack. Catch them off guard. Basheshwar. We'll attack in the morning. We'll attack in the morning. [Islamic prayer] [Islamic prayer] You do know we can even die today. Come what may, don't be afraid. [Speaking in foreign language] [Speaking in foreign language] [Speaking in foreign language] Hey... [Speaking in foreign language] [Speaking in foreign language] Who the f*** is this guy? He's the little girl's father. Is this guy here for you both? Yes. He's here for my son.
