[kisses] I love you. Bye! MEREDITH & MARIANTHI: Bye! TEACHER: Hi. JULIA: Sample of the new flyer. LIZBETH: Oh great. JULIA: Got a minute? Go to my office and review it. LIZBETH: This looks great. JULIA: Doesn't it? Did a really nice job... LIZBETH: [whispering] Be out in a sec. LIZBETH: Hey there. I'm Lizbeth. Can I help you? Joan, can you bring us an ice pack? Why don't we go sit down? Right through here. Yeah... LIZBETH: We have a nurse here at the shelter. Would you like to see her? SOPHIE: No, no, I'm fine. LIZBETH: You can file a police report against whoever did this. SOPHIE: I don't want to make him any angrier. LIZBETH: Who's he? SOPHIE: Ben... My husband. LIZBETH: Would you like us to help you? We have room if you want to come stay. SOPHIE: You know what, I don't really know why I came. I think I should go. LIZBETH: No. Keep it. We're always here. You didn't do anything to deserve what happened to you. JULIA: Hopefully she'll come back. LIZBETH: Yeah I hope so. I didn't even get her name. JULIA: Neither did I the first time you came in. GREG: There you go, just the way you like it. TEACHER: Oh thanks, you remembered. GREG: Sure I did. How is everything? TEACHER: Oh great. The girls are so lovely. GREG: Cool, cool. Girls! I'll see you on Sunday. Okay. Be good! LIZBETH: What are you doing here Greg? GREG: What does it look like? LIZBETH: This isn't your time to see them. GREG: Okay, so it's uh, five o'clock, that means in nineteen hours, no more court order. Now when I want to see my kids... I will. LIZBETH: There's still a schedule - GREG: Don't tell me what to do Lizbeth. They're my blood. Never forget that. MEREDITH: Mommy! LIZBETH: Hey you two. You ready to go home? Come on, lets go... Wave good-bye to your daddy. GREG: Bye-bye. MEREDITH & MARIANTHI: Bye! ANN: You can dress them in these tiny outfits, and this one, even has a dog. LIZBETH: What do you girls say? MEREDITH & MARIANTHI: Thank you! ANN: You are so very welcome. MARIANTHI: Come on we can go share. LIZBETH: You, know, you don't have to bring them something every time you come. ANN: I know, but I like being the fun aunt, even if we're not officially sisters. Cheers. Speaking of fun... Michael has hired a new paralegal and he's really nice. We could keep it under wraps, a dinner maybe, with me and Michael at our place? LIZBETH: And then what? Are you going to let us date in secret at your place too? Because Greg will find out. And I can't afford to have my tires slashed again. ANN: I just wish I could find someone who would protect you. LIZBETH: Well, that's what I thought Greg was gonna do and look where we are. ANN: Greg could have fooled anyone. LIZBETH: I know, I know. He still does. And he was just docked for child support and his supervised visits are over, so I do not want to poke the bear. ANN: Well if he doesn't play by the rules Michael will take it to the judge and he won't get any visitation. LIZBETH: See, I don't need another man. I have you and your husband to look out for me. ANN: Cheers. LIZBETH: Okay you two, it is late. MEREDITH: At daddy's he doesn't put us to bed, so we can stay up as long as we want. LIZBETH: Well, that sounds like fun, but if you stay go to bed late every night then you won't have any energy to play, and I know you want to have fun with your new dolls. LIZBETH: I love you my brave girls. MEREDITH: I love you mommy. MARIANTHI: I love you too. LIZBETH: Goodnight. Ok... [car engine in distance] [car speeds off] LIZBETH: Mer' honey put that in your pocket. FONTINA: There are my beautiful girls! Ah, what's this? You let them bring toys to church? LIZBETH: Mer' honey can you put it in your pocket. FONTINA: I think you need godmother FONTINA to teach you some manners hm? So one day a nice Greek boy like your father will marry you. LIZBETH: FONTINA. GREG: Gotcha! [girls giggle] GREG: Look at this face huh? Like a Greek princess. So what do you say? Shall we live in a palace one day? Alright. Well only a few hours until it's daddy time. MEREDITH & MARIANTHI: Nai Bampa. GREG: Okay. LIZBETH: Come on. Let's go. LIZBETH: Lets just... okay. [knocking] GREG: Are they ready? LIZBETH: Yeah. Of course. Girls! Get your bags. Why is Fontina's son driving you? GREG: Why is that your business? MARIANTHI, Meredith, let's go! MEREDITH: Mommy will you pick us up from daycare tomorrow? LIZBETH: Not tomorrow but the day after tomorrow. Okay? But you can always call me. GREG: Ahh... They won't be calling. They're with me! LIZBETH: Have fun! MARIANTHI: Bye! MEREDITH: Bye. LIZBETH: Love you! JULIA: Hey. Greg have the girls? Unsupervised? LIZBETH: Yeah. They lifted the visitation restriction. I just wish I could have them all the time, you know. You should have seen his performance at church the other day. Like he was the best father in the world. JULIA: I get you want to keep the girls connected to their heritage but it's not yours, you don't have to keep going. Look, why don't you come over to my place for dinner. We can talk about anything but Greg. LIZBETH: Thanks Julia. But I just-I need to get home just in case he lets the girls call. JULIA: Alright. But I'm around if you need anything. You got this. [beeping] [melancholy piano music] -This is Greg Diakos, leave me a message. LIZBETH: Hey Janet, I know I'm here early but ah, can I just go grab the girls? JANET: They're not here. LIZBETH: What? JANET: They weren't dropped off again today. I assumed they were home sick. LIZBETH: No, they're not. [dramatic music] POLICE OFFICER: Is there any chance he took the kids out? Lost track of time? LIZBETH: No. No. We have a very strict custody agreement because Greg could be violent. Look up his record. You'll see all the restraining orders against him. POLICE OFFICER: Have you tried contacting any of his friends? Family? LIZBETH: His family's in Greece and his friends wouldn't tell me anything. POLICE OFFICER: Okay. Do you mind if I make a quick call? LIZBETH: Please. Yeah. POLICE OFFICER: I may know someone who can help. POLICE OFFICER: It's a small community up here. POLICE OFFICER: Hey, it's Peter. I'm trying to locate a Greg Diakos. You know him? Okay, okay thanks. It's not yet confirmed but the word is, is that uh, he left town. With your girls. LIZBETH: Wha -Where? Where did he go? POLICE OFFICER: I-I don't know, but I'll go by his house. If he's not there I'll make sure that the report goes through the appropriate unit. LIZBETH: What unit is that? POLICE OFFICER: Crimes against children. Don't-don't worry okay. They're gonna get to the bottom of this. LIZBETH: Okay. CHERYL: Lizbeth! Lizbeth! CHERYL: Hey. Hey! Get those elbows off the table! I dunno how many times I have to tell you?! LIAM: Ma'am? If you don't stop hurting us, we can't live with you anymore. CHERYL: Is that so? Well, there he is. Why don't you make yourself useful Kova, and teach your step kids some manners. Even your own daughter doesn't have any. [car trunk slams] CHERYL: Wave bye-bye to your brother. It's the last time you'll see'm cause I found us a new daddy who's gonna take good care of us. LIZBETH: Okay, thank you. Detective Spring? I'm Lizbeth Meredith. My children were kidnapped by their father, Gregory Diakos and I was told the report would go to your department. DETECTIVE SPRING: There's not that much we can do without proof that he's actually left town. LIZBETH: Then track his license plate, or call the airports- DETECTIVE SPRING: Ms. Meredith, We don't have those types of resources. My instincts are telling me he'll be back in a day or two. LIZBETH: Do you know how many times I've called the police because of him detective? Five. And those weren't even for the times he beat me so badly he almost killed me. They were to file restraining orders against him and he is still looking for ways to punish me. So my instincts are telling me that no, he won't be back in a day or two. Please, will you help me? DETECTIVE SPRING: I'm sorry. I can't get a warrant for his arrest without proof of where he is. LIZBETH: Ah, so that's just-that's it? You won't even report them missing? DETECTIVE SPRING: Not without a warrant. But I'll make some calls. I'll keep you posted. [phone ringing] LIZBETH: Look, I-I don't- DETECTIVE SPRING: Detective Spring. Oh, yes thank you for calling. Yeah... I do I have it right here. FONTINA: Just leave these in the back of the church. LIZBETH: Where is he FONTINA? FONTINA: Lizbeth. LIZBETH: Your son drove Greg to pick up my girls. Where did he take them? FONTINA: What are you talking about? LIZBETH: He's taken my children! My God, my God FONTINA you are a mother - FONTINA: And he's their father. It doesn't feel so good to be without your children, does it? LIZBETH: Can't you see what kind of man he is? FONTINA: What I see is those girls need family. A proper family. Like the one they have in Greece. LIZBETH: No. ANN: Why would he take them? He didn't even show up for visitation half the time. LIZBETH: You know why, it's to punish me. It's what he does. Everything he does is to punish me for leaving him. MICHAEL: Lizbeth you can't just go to Greece and take your daughters back. LIZBETH: Why not? Michael, he kidnapped my kids! And without proof that detective won't get a warrant, won't even put my girls in the missing database. MICHAEL: I understand your frustration but the laws are different over there, and they're more likely to protect the man. You gotta follow protocol on this. ANN: He's right Lizbeth. MICHAEL: There is also the fact that Greece just entered into the Hague Convention. Which means that they must respect the custody agreements of the countries from where the children were taken. LIZBETH: Okay. MICHAEL: But only if you don't break the law. LIZBETH: Okay, I get-I get it. I- I can't just sit around and wait for protocol on this. Someone has the proof I need. I need to find it. LIZBETH: I'm-I'm hoping you can help me. My ex-husband took my daughters and flew out of Anchorage, and I'm wondering if maybe he booked their travel through you? Maybe you have travel documents or an itinerary- LYNN: I'm sorry but we can't disclose any client information. LIZBETH: No I-I understand that, but he kidnapped my girls and I need to prove that he left the country so there's anything you can do to help me- LYNN: I'm so sorry, I had no idea that Greg would do anything like this. LIZBETH: I'm s -do you know him? LYNN: We dated for a while. Not now. But he asked me to book him one-way tickets to Athens for him and his- for your daughters. I didn't think anything of it at the time but then I read your story in the paper and so I called the police. LIZBETH: I'm sor-The police know about this? LYNN: Yes. I left a message for the Detective on the case, and I told her that Greg had flown to Greece. She-wait... this is the itinerary. LIZBETH: Thank you for this. [suspenseful music] LIZBETH: Here. In case the call from the travel agency wasn't proof enough. Why would you ignore this? DETECTIVE SPRING: Your ex -husband was concerned about your mental state. LIZBETH: You spoke to him? DETECTIVE SPRING: He came to see me. And I was sure his concerns were legitimate. LIZBETH: Yeah. He is a masterful liar. Look, you're not the first person he's fooled and you won't be the last. But we need to get that arrest warrant and we need to make sure that my girls are entered into the FBI's NCIC database and it needs to happen now. DETECTIVE SPRING: Okay. LIZBETH: Yes, well I am trying to work with my local authorities but I need help finding my girls which is why I'm calling the state department... No I don't have a lawyer, do you know where I could find one who understands Greek law? The phone book... that's very helpful thank you. Oh my god... LIZBETH: Okay... Come on... LIZBETH: Julia? Hey, it's Lizbeth. Do you know if Bev Cutler is still on the board of directors of the AWAIC? Do you think she could connect me to her father? Yeah, yeah I know he's President Clinton's lawyer. LLOYD CUTLER: Ms. Meredith? Lloyd Cutler. My daughter Bev is a great admirer of what you've done with the AWAIC, and-and so am I. LIZBETH: Thank you. LLOYD CUTLER: Please, have a seat. I've been reviewing your case and to be frank, getting your daughters back won't be easy. Greece is its own country and consequently, we have limited power there. LIZBETH: What about the Hague convention? LLOYD CUTLER: Well, they may have signed it but it's up to them to honor it. And if they don't then you'll be fighting in their judicial system. What you need is a Greek lawyer living in Greece. I'll get in touch with a colleague of mine in Thessaloniki. He's an old hand at dealing with cases like yours. LIZBETH: Does that mean he's been successful? LLOYD CUTLER: I think you should prepare yourself for the battle ahead. I've had more than my fair share of conversations with mothers and fathers, who have spent years trying to get their children back. Despite the Hague. LIZBETH: Well, I'm ready, I'll do whatever it takes. [music] LIZBETH: [sighs] Great... [phone ringing] LIZBETH: Hello? HECTOR: Ms. Meredith this is Hector Papadakis in Thessaloniki. I was asked to take your case by President Clinton's lawyer, Mr. Cutler. LIZBETH: Yes, hi, thank you so much for calling. Do you have any news? HECTOR: I do. The courts in Greece have ruled to recognize and enforce your American Custody Order. LIZBETH: That's amazing news. Ah, wow um, okay I-I can be there in a few of days. HECTOR: No. It is not necessary to come until we find your girls. I will call again when I know more. Adio. LIZBETH: Wha-how will you find them though-hello? ANN: You sure about this? LIZBETH: I'm their mother Ann. I should be there lighting a fire under whoever can help me find them. I know what it feels like to be unwanted and it would kill me if they thought even for a second that I wasn't doing everything I could to help them. ANN: Here. I don't want you sleeping on the streets. LIZBETH: Ann - ANN: No. I don't wanna hear it. You have probably maxed out everything you have just to get there. And I want to help. Because I love those girls too. Kay? LIZBETH: Thank you. ANN: Kay. Let's get you on that flight. [knocking] LIZBETH: Um, I'm Lizbeth Meredith. I'm your client from Alaska. HECTOR: Ms. Meredith. I wasn't expecting you. LIZBETH: Yes I know, but I needed to come. HECTOR: Please. LIZBETH: Oh, thank you. HECTOR: I understand your desire to be here, but your presence won't help the process. LIZBETH: Mr. Pappadakis my daughters were taken months ago, and other than recognizing my already legal custody nothing has been done. TALLY: Lizbeth? Hi, I'm Tally. Hello, nice to meet you. I work with Hector. Would you like some water? LIZBETH: Thank you. Yes. TALLY: Great so Hector has been speaking to the embassy about securing passports for your daughters isn't that right? HECTOR: That's correct. LIZBETH: Great. Great. Cuz as soon as I find them we'll be on the first flight back home. HECTOR: Ms. Meredith there is a process and if you just take your children back to Alaska you will be prosecuted and your embassy would have no choice but to work with the Greek authorities. LIZBETH: I'm sor-how-how can I be prosecuted if the Hague Convention is being followed? HECTOR: It's complicated. LIZBETH: How is it complicated? My daughters were kidnapped by my ex-husband who is a very dangerous man. There's nothing complicated about that. TALLY: Why don't we get you something to eat. LIZBETH: Yeah thank you. That would be-that would be great, I still have a lot I need to do. I need to contact the consulate and do you- do you know of any good budget hotels? TALLY: Yes. Of course. Just let me grab my purse. TALLY: Let's go. LIZBETH: Okay -Thank you. TALLY: That's it, uh, it's just one bedroom but the sofa pulls out. LIZBETH: This is incredibly kind of you. TALLY: It's not Athens but fair priced hotels are hard to find in Thessaloniki. But maybe we could keep this between us? LIZBETH: Oh yes, of course. I don't need another reason for Hector to be annoyed with me. TALLY: He's not annoyed with you. It's the process. He has to stay focused. And sometimes that's hard when emotions get involved. Trust Hector. He knows the system, he's really passionate about what he does. He will do everything he can. LIZBETH: Okay. But there's got to be something that I can do? I-I know what they're going through. The same thing happened to me when I was there age. My mother took me from my father. So look um, do you think Hector could help me get my story out to the local news? TALLY: No, I don't think he would like that. LIZBETH: Why? TALLY: Last year a foreign woman like yourself came to Greece to bring her children home. She picketed outside their school, she received a lot of media attention. She ended up with more enemies then friends, and never got her children back. LIZBETH: Hi. I have an appointment. Yes, okay, thank you. PENELOPE: Ms. Meredith. It's a pleasure and please, let me tell you how sorry I am about your children. LIZBETH: Thank you. I just hope the consulate can help find them. PENELOPE: Of course, of course. Follow me. LIZBETH: Okay... LIZBETH: What exactly are you doing to locate them? PENELOPE: There are avenues to explore, the ministry of education, hospitals... LIZBETH: Have you had any luck? PENELOPE: Your case just landed on my desk after your call yesterday. LIZBETH: Um, okay well, this might help. Um, just some most recent pictures of Meredith and MARIANTHI and some information on Greg and his family here in Greece. PENELOPE: Has he been in contact with you? LIZBETH: No. No I haven't heard from him or my girls since he took them. [door knocking] LIZBETH: It's a good thing I flew out here because up until now the consulate has done absolutely nothing. So I think we need to do what we can. Like hire a private investigator. HECTOR: We did that. He saw your girls just once and took the money. LIZBETH: He saw them? Where? HECTOR: When Greg visited his family. But after that the investigator failed to find where they lived, even though that's what the crook was paid to do. LIZBETH: Okay. Okay so we know that Greg is in communication with his family right? So so we go after them. We tap their phones... HECTOR: Tapping phones is illegal. LIZBETH: Kidnapping is illegal. Why is this so hard? Or or does Greg just have immunity here because he's a man? HECTOR: I won't take offense to that because you're right. But that doesn't mean I'll break the law. And I won't hire any more investigators. I'll handle your case as I know how. You just have to be patient with our system. LIZBETH: I have been Hector. I have been patient. But I haven't seen my daughters in months. I haven't touched their hair or heard them laugh. I don-... I don't have anymore patience. [music] TALLY: Okay. Great. I'm gonna tell her, thank you. That was the woman from the consulate. The ministry has a Meredith and MARIANTHI Diakos enrolled at a school not far away from here. She's going to meet you there tomorrow. LIZBETH: Tomorrow? Tomorrow I'm going to see my girls, tomorrow? TALLY: Yes. LIZBETH: Oh -oh my god! I have-I have to get them something. I have to pick up a toy or a gift or a treat or...? TALLY: I think they'll just be happy to see their mother. [music] [music] LIZBETH: Hi! School's just down that way right? PENELOPE: Yes, but I'm sorry, I tried to reach you... LIZBETH: Why? What do you mean? PENELOPE: I just learned that your daughters have not been at school for two days. LIZBETH: What? Where are they? PENELOPE: I don't know, but I believe your ex-husband was informed of our contact with the school. LIZBETH: You contacted the school? PENELOPE: Yes. LIZBETH: Why?! Why! PENELOPE: We wanted to make sure the girls were here... Lizbeth, please! Lizbeth it was a bad decision, I'm sorry but here's the principal, he will tell you they're not here... LIZBETH: Where are Meredith and MARIANTHI Diakos? I'm their mother. You must have some record of where they are. Where they live. PENELOPE: [GREEK] PRINCIPAL: [GREEK] PENELOPE: I'm sorry. He has no information to give you. Their father never provided any. LIZBETH: You have no idea what you've done. PENELOPE: I assure you, we will find your daughters again. LIZBETH: Yes, but now he knows I'm here. And he's had two days to run knowing that I'm looking for them. And we have no idea where he'll take them, or what he might do. [music] LIZBETH: I know and I will keep calling until you have some news... Fine, fine, I will call again tomorrow. TALLY: Still nothing? LIZBETH: No. TALLY: Here. I know they made a mistake. But the consulate will locate them again. Until then you are welcome to stay here for as long as you need to. LIZBETH: That is so kind of you. But it took them months to find them this time. And I don't have the money to hire my own PI. I spent everything I had just to get here. I don't want to leave but I can't afford to stay. So until I can figure out how to pay for all of this, I have to go. TALLY: Then go. And the next time you're here, it will be to take your girls back home. [phone ringing] LIZBETH: Hello? GREG: I heard you were in Greece. LIZBETH: Greg, Greg. I'm their mother. They need me. GREG: No they don't. I told them you don't want them. They don't ask about you anymore. LIZBETH: Let me talk to them ... please put them on the- put them on the phone- GREG: You won't get them back. And if you try again, I'll kill you. LIZBETH: Greg! [crying] [sobbing] LIZBETH: Hello. LIZBETH: Here you go. I've called for the nurse. They're on their way. SOPHIE: I thought he was going to kill me. And all I could think was, was if I die, I won't be here for my son. To protect him and fight for him if I need to. LIZBETH: Well you're here. So now you can. [music] JULIA: Thank you. LIZBETH: How are we doing? JULIA: Everyone's been very generous, so... let's hope we get there. LIZBETH: Okay. MICHAEL: Lizbeth? LIZBETH: Yeah? MICHAEL: Hi uh, can I speak to you for a minute? LIZBETH: Sure. Is everything okay? MICHAEL: Greg has asked the Greek courts to award him legal custody. LIZBETH: No they can't do that. I -I have legal custody. MICHAEL: I know. But possession is nine /tenths of the law and even though he kidnapped them the girls are now there, with him. So there's a possibility the Greek courts might not recognize your custody and award it to Greg. I'm sorry. [phone ringing] LIZBETH: Tally? Hi, it's Lizbeth. I know it's early there but I can't wait any longer. I need to find my girls now. So I need a private investigator... I know, I'll be sure to get the money. LIZBETH: Ah, I just settled Sophie into her room. JULIA: And her son? LIZBETH: Yeah. He's with a friend. She's bringing him by. JULIA: Good. Then you can go back to Greece knowing that they're safe. LIZBETH: We did it? JULIA: We did it. You have all the money you need to go and find your girls and twelve weeks of paid time off to do it. LIZBETH: What? JULIA: Everyone donated their vacation time. No one felt that they could take time off with their families knowing that you couldn't. LIZBETH: What? Oh my God... I can't believe you. JULIA: What? Hug her before she hits me again. Come on now. TALLY: So. This is where he insisted you meet him. LIZBETH: That's him? TALLY: Yeah.. Lizbeth. I have to tell you. After today I cannot be involved. Because if Hector finds out that I found you a PI, he will be furious with me. LIZBETH: Yeah. I understand. Don't worry. Hector doesn't even know I'm here. Yeah, okay. MANOLIS: Sit. LIZBETH: No thank you. MANOLIS: Do you have the money? LIZBETH: Yeah. I do. Do you have a plan? MANOLIS: Of course. LIZBETH: What is it? MANOLIS: You don't need to question me. This is my job. LIZBETH: I'm paying you a lot of money to do that job, so I'd like to know what the plan is. MANOLIS: You American women are aggressive, huh? LIZBETH: Okay, so? MANOLIS: I know people in his hometown. His friends. LIZBETH: No. Not his friends they'll just protect him. You need to get to his family. MANOLIS: I'll go to Tyrnavos and we'll see. While I'm gone you stay. Don't go anywhere. LIZBETH: No. No I'm going with you. I'm not staying here. MANOLIS: You're crazy. They will see you. LIZBETH: I'm not going to just sit here and do nothing. I won- TALLY: Lizbeth I think you have to stay here. It will be safer. LIZBETH: The last time someone else went to look for my girls they screwed it up so no. No. I'm going with him or he doesn't get paid. MANOLIS: Tomorrow. We go. LIZBETH: Good. Tomorrow then. [suspenseful music] MANOLIS: That one. His sister's house. LIZBETH: What are you going to say to her? MANOLIS: That she needs to tell me where her brother is so he can pay me his debt. LIZBETH: You think that'll work? MANOLIS: Most people listen to me. [knocking] [chattering in Greek] MANOLIS: She said Greg is not here. He left Greece. But she doesn't know where. LIZBETH: She's lying. MANOLIS: Maybe. LIZBETH: Greg's brother will know where he is. When we were married he used to talk to him on the phone every week. I'm sure he still does. Do what you have to. TONY: Hey Lizzie? Hey Lizzie! LIZBETH: No thank you. CHERYL: Why do you think we left your real daddy? He doesn't want you. Hasn't come looking for you has he? Don't forget how lucky you are to have a daddy like Tony. Learn to show some gratitude. MANOLIS: I did it. I tapped the phones and found them in Pereas. Tomorrow I take you to see your girls. We'll serve him with a court order so in twenty-four hours he must give you your daughters. LIZBETH: Twenty-four... twenty-four hours, what's what's to stop him from leaving with them again? MANOLIS: Don't worry, I have friends in the village who will watch and make sure he stays. But I'll need money to pay them. LIZBETH: I already gave you twelve thousand dollars. MANOLIS: To find your girls, and I did. LIZBETH: You found them because I told you what to do. MANOLIS: So you would tap his brother's phone hm? Like some American spy? Their price is five thousand. LIZBETH: I-I-I don't have it. Two thousand. It's all I have. MANOLIS: Why did he take them? LIZBETH: To punish me for leaving him. He was abusing me - and I couldn't have them living like that anymore. MANOLIS: Bring me a thousand, and I'll make sure they watch him. LIZBETH: Thank you-thank you. [tense music] [tense music] MANOLIS: School is finished in fifteen minutes... Don't worry. He won't follow you. GREG: You stupid bitch. They don't want you! They hate you! MANOLIS: Hey hey! LIZBETH: Meredith and MARIANTHI Diakos? TEACHER: Who are you? LIZBETH: I'm their mother. TEACHER: Oh uh, please, wait here. LIZBETH: Okay. TEACHER: MARIANTHI, Meredith. Look. It's your mother. Give her a hug. LIZBETH: Hello my brave girls. I've been looking for you for a long time. I've missed you so much. MARIANTHI: Go away! Leave me alone! I don't want to go with you! TEACHER: MARIANTHI stop it. Your mother loves you, she came to find you. MARIANTHI: No she doesn't. She doesn't want us!! I hate her! LIZBETH: Okay. It's okay. It's okay. Hey, hey, hey. I know what your father's told you. But I would never have left you, not in a million years. Because I love you. I love you both so much. TEACHER: Please, you have to take them. They come to school only for a few days a month and they are never bathed or cared for. They are just confused. We are all confused. They told us that you were dead. LIZBETH: Their father has just been served with a court order giving him twenty-four hours to return them to me. Until then there's nothing that I can do. Girls, hey. I'll see you tomorrow. It's going to be okay. I promise you okay. GREG: Where are they? Guess they didn't want to come with you? LIZBETH: You can tell them what you want Greg. But as you can see I'm very much alive. And tomorrow my girls and I are going home. LIZBETH: They didn't want to go with me. They didn't even want me to touch them. MANOLIS: Don't worry. Tomorrow when you are able to take them you will have help from the police and the consulate. LIZBETH: And what if he disappears again? MANOLIS: He knows I have friends watching him. He won't go anywhere. GREG: Hey you two. How are you? LIZBETH: [CRYING] Oh god, just go, just go. GREG: Welcome ladies. Your friend here arrived before you so, we've been getting to know one another. Come on, join us? Have something to eat? Drink? PENELOPE: We're here to return the girls to their mother. GREG: Well, I was just telling the police chief how they don't want to go with her. Because why would they want to leave this beautiful country? Their family. For America? BAILIFF: Just bring us the girls. GREG: And you are? LIZBETH: He's the court bailiff. He's here to make sure that you follow the court order. POLICE CHIEF: Bring them. GREG: Okay. You can see them. MARIANTHI! Meredith! LIZBETH: Hi. GREG: See? I told you she was going to try and take you to America. BAILIFF: Girls, you must go with your mother now. MARIANTHI: We don't want to go. We're happy here. We have toys, friends and family. GREG: What did I tell you? They don't want to go. Do you? POLICE CHIEF: So why do you want to take them hm? They're happy. BAILIFF: I told you sir, it doesn't matter - LIZBETH: It's okay, it's okay. MARIANTHI. That little doll I know you love, that was a gift from our friend Ann. Do you remember her? She used to come over all the time, she'd always bring you both a toy. Meredith you have one of those too. You even made a house for it. It's back at home. Where your friends are. So why don't we go now, back home, where everything's waiting for you. Yeah? Come on. POLICE CHIEF: Go with your mother. LIZBETH: It's okay. Come on baby. It's going to be okay. Let's go. Come on it's okay. It's okay... Come on get in the car. BAILIFF: You can still charge him with kidnapping. GREG: She wouldn't dare. LIZBETH: Do it. GREG: This ain't over Lizbeth! They are my children, in my country! You know what I told you would happen if you take them back! PENELOPE: Here's where you can spend the night. LIZBETH: No. Thank you Penelope. But we need to leave tonight. PENELOPE: There are no flights until the morning. LIZBETH: Okay, well we'll take a bus or a train. PENELOPE: Ms. Meredith you have no need to worry. You've had Mr. Diakos arrested. LIZBETH: But how long can they hold him? Cuz he told me that if I came back, he would kill me. PENELOPE: Then the consulate is the safest place to be. And I assure you, we will have you on a flight first thing in the morning. LIZBETH: Okay. LIZBETH: Sh-sh- it's okay... I love you my brave girls. LIZBETH: I knew you'd like that one. MARIANTHI You want to pick out a shirt? Okay, okay what else do we have here? Ah. After you get dressed, brush teeth and then I can tie up your hair however you like. Yeah? MARIANTHI: No. LIZBETH: MARIANTHI, you have to brush your teeth okay? LIZBETH: I know it's been a long time, but when we were back home we would wake up, we brush teeth, brush hair. And then we'd go eat breakfast. Yeah? Come, come on let me show you what we've got. Over here, see? MARIANTHI they have cereal. It's your favorite... Okay how about this? We eat breakfast and then we brush teeth. Sound good? Okay. Come on. Sit down... [knocking] PENELOPE: You must leave quickly. LIZBETH: What happened? PENELOPE: Greg has already been released. [tense music] LIZBETH: We don't wanna miss our flight, lets go... IMMIGRATION OFFICER: Madam. LIZBETH: Hello. IMMIGRATION OFFICER: [GREEK] IMMIGRATION OFFICER 2: Come forward. Just you. Are you Lizbeth Meredith? LIZBETH: Yes. IMMIGRATION OFFICER 2: You're under arrest for kidnapping. LIZBETH: No you don't, you don't understand. It was-I- IMMIGRATION OFFICER 2: Bring the kids. LIZBETH: You have got this wrong. This is not the... it's okay girls. I'm not the one that did this! He did this! LIZBETH: Please, please you have to listen to me. My ex-husband, he's the one who kidnapped them. Just check the FBI's NCIC data base. Please. IMMIGRATION OFFICER: Be quiet. We have people checking on your claims. LIZBETH: If you would just call the consulate. [PHONE RINGING] IMMIGRATION OFFICER: Thank you. LIZBETH: What is, what did they say? IMMIGRATION OFFICER: You are being released. PENELOPE: I'm sorry Lizbeth. I got you out as fast as I could. Your girls are with the police. LIZBETH: Okay. GREG: What did I tell you? LIZBETH: There's a warrant out for your arrest Greg. Because you kidnapped them. GREG: How dare you! This is where they belong! With me, their father! LIZBETH: You don't care about them. You don't even bathe them. You're just doing this to punish me. And those precious girls are paying the price. IMMIGRATION OFFICER: Hey, hey, hey! LIZBETH: Go ahead. Hit me again. Show them all who you really are. IMMIGRATION OFFICER 2: Enough! A decision has been made. She's being released. GREG: But she's taking my children! IMMIGRATION OFFICER 2: We've confirmed that your charges against her for kidnapping are false. Come, I take you to your daughters. But you cannot leave the country. LIZBETH: What? No, no, no I have legal custody I can take them home - IMMIGRATION OFFICER 2: We've heard from the district attorney. Mr. Diakos has appealed for custody arrangements. So there must be a hearing before you can leave. PENELOPE: How can he appeal? There's a warrant for his arrest. IMMIGRATION OFFICER 2: Greece hasn't recognized those charges. So the court now will decide what is best for the children. Until then, they on stay with you. GREG: I told you this wasn't over. LIZBETH: Hey. Come here I just want to talk to you for a sec okay? I'm so sorry about what just happened. I know, I know how scary that was. But I am your mom and I won't leave you. So I have to fight. Okay? Take your shoes off. [phone ringing] ANN: Hello? LIZBETH: Ann it's me. ANN: Lizbeth? Oh my gosh I've been waiting to hear from you. Do you have the girls? LIZBETH: I do. And I almost got out today but he stopped me. ANN: What? LIZBETH: And now I have to go to court and plead my case. And I don't even know if I have a lawyer anymore. ANN: I'm so sorry Lizbeth. I wish Michael could help. LIZBETH: No, no that's not, that's not why I called. I just wanted to hear a friendly voice. ANN: I'm coming out there. And don't try and talk me out of it because you need someone on your side. LIZBETH: I'm uh, I will not argue with you. Thank you. Thank you. I love you. LIZBETH: Hector, hi, it's Lizbeth. I really need your help. Can you please give me a call back at the number I left. Thank you. MEREDITH: You're stupid! Stupid girl! LIZBETH: Oh no no no. What did she do? MEREDITH: This. LIZBETH: That was just an accident though. And we all have accidents. It doesn't make us stupid. And it certainly doesn't mean that we can hurt somebody. Yeah, here you go... It is a beautiful day. What do you guys think about getting out of here? We can go to the beach, or the park, or- MEREDITH: Yes please. LIZBETH: Yes. MARIANTHI? Okay, let's do it. Come on, come on. LIZBETH: Go check it out. See how fast those slides are, yeah? MEREDITH: Come on! MARIANTHI & MEREDITH: Three, two, one... Gooo! LIZBETH: Woo-hoo! MEREDITH: Push me mommy. LIZBETH: Yeah? Okay. How high you want to go? MEREDITH: Super high. LIZBETH: Super high, the highest you've ever been? MARIANTHI: Push me? LIZBETH: Yeah sure. Here we go. [laughing] MEREDITH: Higher! [giggling] HECTOR: [GREEK] LIZBETH: Hello. Hector? I wanted to introduce you to my daughters, Meredith and MARIANTHI. Girls, this is the man who's going to help us. HECTOR: Did you know...? TALLY: Hi girls. Hi. I'm Tally. I'm a friend of your mother's. Would you like some candy? We have a bowl here for special clients. Come, we'll pick flavors. HECTOR: Should I ask how you found them? LIZBETH: No. HECTOR: Alright. Now I guess we have work to do to get you all home. HECTOR: [GREEK] HECTOR: I've learnt the proceedings will be heard by Judge Georgiou. I've never been in his court but we have a strong case. But still, the judge wants to question your daughters. LIZBETH: What? No, no, no. no. I don't want them to have to go through that, I- HECTOR: I know, and I'm sorry. But it has to be so. CHERYL: Okay. You ready? You know what to say. CHERYL: Good morning, Judge. JUDGE: Ah, you must be Lizbeth Meredith. Why don't you sit and your mother can wait outside. JUDGE: So tell me. If there's one person in the whole world you'd call your daddy, who would that person be? TALLY: [SINGING] One, two! MEREDITH: [LAUGHING] I got it! LIZBETH: Oh my god, oh you're here. You're here, . Oh., ,, Girls, girls come see Ann. Come here, come here, come here! ANN: Look at you two. Do you remember me? Well in case you have forgotten... These are for you. MARIANTHI: Thank you. MEREDITH: Thank you ANN: You're so very welcome... So how are they? LIZBETH: Better. But- ANN: No. Don't worry. You're going to have their whole lives to undo the damage that was done here. Because there is no way that Greg is going to win this case. Okay? LIZBETH: Yeah. ANN: You found them! LIZBETH: I found them. I found them. ANN: You found them. LIZBETH: Yes, I did. LIZBETH: Okay, can I just have a second? Okay girls. Alright so just remember, when you talk to the judge, just tell them the truth. Okay? That's all he wants to hear. Alright go ahead. HECTOR: Clever of him to hire a woman. But don't worry, it won't change anything. [GAVEL] HECTOR: Be prepared. Our courts operate differently. JUDGE GEORGIOU: This hearing is about child kidnapping. The father abducted the children from Alaska and then the mother attempted to do the same here. HECTOR: Your honor, this is not the same. She already had custody! TINA: She is not in America your honor! We have our own laws! [GAVEL] JUDGE GEORGIOU: Gregory Diakos. Sir do you have a job? GREG: Of course. I work at the Hotel Kastoria. JUDGE GEORGIOU: Really? And how is that possible when it's been closed for five years? [chuckling] GREG: Uh, I meant to say Hotel Argos. JUDGE: Mm. And did you kidnap your daughters and bring them to Greece? GREG: No. Never! Their mother said I could take them. And now I'm being falsely accused by a woman who does not even have a relationship with her own mother. But here in Greece my daughters have family. HECTOR: Mr. Diakos, why have your daughters only been in school for sixty days in almost two years? GREG: We are busy. HECTOR: Working at Hotel Kastoria? [laughter] JUDGE GEORGIOU: Ms. Meredith. Ma'am is it true social workers have been called to your home in Alaska for abusing your children. ANN: How does he know that? LIZBETH: Greg would call them every time I refused to reconcile with him. And every time, they found his claims to be false. JUDGE GEORGIOU: Why did you not want to reconcile with your husband? LIZBETH: Because in the four years I was married to Greg he gambled, did drugs, rarely held down a job. There were days he wouldn't even come home. And when he did, he would beat me, in front of his daughters. There are police records - TINA: Your honor those records have no merit in our country. JUDGE GEORGIOU: Please, continue. LIZBETH: My whole life has been about protecting my girls, providing a safe and stable home for them. A home where they have friends, where they go to school every day. Where I never denied their father the right to see them. But I never gave him permission to take them. And ever since the day that Greg kidnapped them, I have been trying to get them back. Even after he threatened to kill me for my efforts. Because, because I love my girls. I love my girls with my whole being. So please, please don't ask them to choose where they want to live. Just let them come home, back to the life they knew before they were taken from me. JUDGE GEORGIOU: Thank you for your candor Ms. Meredith. But in order for me to make a ruling, I must speak to your girls. But I will do so gently. LIZBETH: Thank you. LIZBETH: That judge has been talking to them for over an hour. ANN: You don't know he's been with them the whole time. HECTOR: She's right. He's likely taking his time to make a ruling. LIZBETH: Is that a good thing? HECTOR: Everyone agrees he seemed very sympathetic to your testimony. ANN: And he laughed in Greg's face. LIZBETH: What do you really think Ann? ANN: I think everyone knows that you're telling the truth. HECTOR: The judge is back. LIZBETH: Okay. JUDGE GEORGIOU: It is clear that the children were taken illegally from their mother's custody and brought to Greece. But the children have now been in Greece for almost two years. And uprooting them again would be a mistake. As such, I am awarding custody to their father Gregory Diakos. [chatter] JUDGE GEORGIOU: Lizbeth Meredith, once you have been served you will have three days to return the girls to their father. [gavel] LIZBETH: [CRYING] LIZBETH: How did this happen? Everyone could see he was lying! HECTOR: Which makes me think Greg's lawyer made a deal with the judge, and the decision was already made. It would explain how he knew details of your marriage. LIZBETH: She can get away with that?! HECTOR: It happens. LIZBETH: So that judge put my girls through all of that questioning when he already knew the answer? HECTOR: I'm sorry Lizbeth. I really thought we had this one. LIZBETH: No. No, no, no. No that can't be it. That's not it. They're not going to honor the Hague convention or the warrant against him? Just none of it? HECTOR: No. But we can keep fighting. File an appeal. You have 3 days until his custody begins, but I can't in good conscience give you much hope. LIZBETH: I have to go get the girls. My god. MARIANTHI: I don't want to stay here anymore. LIZBETH: I know, but if we try to leave the same thing will happen again at the airport. MARIANTHI: But he doesn't feed us. He leaves us alone, and when I tried to have a friend and gave her some of our chocolate, he choked me. LIZBETH: Baby. None of that was your fault. MEREDITH: I'm sorry. LIZBETH: Oh what, baby what -what are you sorry for? MEREDITH: I-I told that man that I only want to visit you. That I want to stay here. That's what daddy tells me to say. But I don't want to stay. So it's all my fault. LIZBETH: No. No, no, no, no, come here, come here baby it is not your fault. Okay. None of this is your fault. And I will never stop trying to get us all home together. I promise you. CHERYL: What is it, Lizbeth? YOUNG LIZBETH: Are we moving? CHERYL: Oh Lizzy me and Tony are. Sorry but there's no room for you in the mobile. YOUNG LIZBETH: So where am I supposed to go? CHERYL: I dunno stay with a friend? Go live with your sister in Seattle maybe? You'll figure it out. [glass smashing] CHERYL: Damnit! YOUNG LIZBETH: [CRYING] LIZBETH: Okay, go ahead. MARIANTHI: Where are we going? LIZBETH: We're gonna meet Ann and Tally. Okay, okay. Come on. In you go. LIZBETH: I can't do it. Even if I stay here he'll never play by the rules - he'll just disappear with them again. And I can't give them back to him knowing he's going to hurt them. I have to get them back home, back to Alaska where my custody will be recognized. TALLY: There's an airport from the island of Kos. The last time I was there they had no computerized passport system. From there you could fly anywhere. ANN: And how would she get to the island? TALLY: By ferry. I could have a friend meet you when it docks, as your husband, so it doesn't look suspicious. LIZBETH: I mean, that could work. As long as Greg doesn't catch me. LIZBETH: We're going home. MARIANTHI: But I thought we couldn't. LIZBETH: They said we can't. But sometimes you have to do what you know is right. And as your mother I know that we need to get home to Alaska. But it's not going to be easy so I need you both to tell me right now, do you really want to come with me? MEREDITH: I do. MARIANTHI: Me too. LIZBETH: Good. Okay. Then I'm going to tell you the plan. [dramatic music] LIZBETH: Girls? Girls, it's time. LIZBETH: Go to that car. LIZBETH: Come on lets move... LIZBETH: Come on! TALLY: Lizbeth! GREG: Lizbeth Meredith. [boat horn] LIZBETH: Keep moving. Keep moving... LIZBETH: Okay. Up the stairs. LIZBETH: Remember girls, only English. LIZBETH: Go go go! That way, that way! LIZBETH: Down the stairs. Down the stairs. Quickly. PORTER: Hey Miss?

PORTER: Excuse me Miss. One of your girls dropped this on the deck? Is it yours? LIZBETH: Yes. Thank you. That was very kind of you. PORTER: You're welcome. Have a nice day. TAXI DRIVER: I'm the last taxi for the night. Do you need a ride? LIZBETH: Uh, no, thank you. TAXI DRIVER: Okay thanks. LIZBETH: Okay um, I don't think he's coming. Okay. Come on. Let's go, let's go. This way. LIZBETH: I'd like a room please. CONCIERGE: Passports... Alaska? LIZBETH: Yeah. CONCIERGE: Room number nine. LIZBETH: Thank you. CONCIERGE: Good night Alaska.

MEREDITH: I want to see the toys! LIZBETH: What? MARIANTHI: Mommy? LIZBETH: Yeah what is it? MARIANTHI: I missed you. LIZBETH: I missed you too! Come here... Come here. Ohh my goodness. My brave girls. ANN: So how's therapy? LIZBETH: It's hard. But I know that the more they talk about it the more they'll heal so. ANN: Don't worry. Don't worry they'll get through it. They have you. LIZBETH: Oh Ann, they're the strong ones. I'm just the lucky one who gets to be here for all of it. MARIANTHI: Mommy can you come push me? LIZBETH: Yeah. Of course. Alright you ready? You too! Come here. Here we go. Higher? MARIANTHI: Higher! LIZBETH: Higher. MEREDITH: Yeah! MARIANTHI: Mer! MEREDITH: Yeah. Higher!
