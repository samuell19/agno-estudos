Bring it tomorrow. - We're doing this again? - Yeah. Okay, but can we find another spot? - I don't see anyone walking here. - Tetsu... This has been my spot forever. L've sung to hundreds of people here. - That was a long time ago. - It doesn't matter. Listen... Everybody knows, good music never gets old. But so much was hyped back then... like you won that prize on the auditioning show. 'Most Creative Award.' So you were part of a trend. But the hype is gone and things have changed. You've got to know that by now. Sorry, that was too much. Nope... You're right, I guess. It's cold here. Let's get a beef bowl and go home. You're trying hard to act like a grown-up, it almost touches my heart A sweet scent of rouge is left... MY WIFE'S SHELL A sweet scent of rouge is left... MY WIFE'S SHELL MY WIFE'S SHELL on your brandy glass. on your brandy glass. Oh, the rain is pouring down... on Miyuki Street. It's midnight in Ginza and we're making love. We're making love... "The Rain" by Hajime Mizorogi Demo tape - 100 yen I think I'm a little bit drunk... It's all your fault. You were watching the lighthouse offshore... your eyes looking so loveless. Oh, the rain is pouring down... on the pier down on the harbor I said, only a kiss... Only a kiss... Did you notice that girl? What about her? Did you see her undenuear? Yeah, the one chewing gum. Yeah... That gum had a strange smell. It was a pretty strong, sweetish smell. What flavor was it? I have no idea. Mitocity Ibaraki - 2000 What was the flavor of that gum you were chewing? What was the flavor of that gum you were chewing? My precious memory is the smell of your chewing gum. Today's guest is the most recent star of lbaraki prefecture. He has released this song on an independent label, 'The Gum You were Chewing'. It has now reached Music Chan's Top 30! This is Hajime Mizorogi. Good evening. Hi. That's a fabulous outfit you're wearing. That's your style? Uh-huh. You've been performing on the streets... for the past five years? That spot is like my home ground. Oh, I see. When did you stop? - Around April, I think. - So not long ago. - Right. The Top 30 is an exceptional success... for a man whose life has been spent on the streets. Can you tell me how you feel? Huh? - Would you say you're surprised by your own success? - Why? What did you say before? - Hmm? About your successm? - Not that. I'm sorry. Did I say something wrong? Life... on the streets? Oh... I do live in an apartment! But that's not what I meant... I know, but there are ways to say things. I'm very sorry. - Sure I'm surprised. - What? I'm surprised by my own success. Oh, I see... Are you okay? I'm used to this. You pull a muscle every time you have sex? - It's because I brace my ass. - What for? - Hemorrhoids. - Are you kidding? - Hemorrhoids? - Give me your number. - Okay, but I'm moving to Tokyo next month. - Why? To become a radio director. It's what I've wanted to do. Yeah? Hey... shouldn't you be more respectful towards me? - What? - Acting like a director already? What are you talking about? Learn some respect. Well, look at you! You keep that attitude, and I'll harass you again. Tokyo, my ass! You're so funny! You should go to Tokyo. You'll make it. You have a great voice. Seriously, you should. Hello, how are you? I'm so sorry... Mitato Ward, Tokyo - 2002 Hello, how are you? I'm so sorry... Mitato Ward, Tokyo - 2002 Mitato Ward, Tokyo - 2002 Yes, Mizorogi is with me. Yes, Mizorogi is with me. We're coming up the stairs now. Thank you very much, see you in a moment. He's waiting - let's go. A compilation album? Isn't it too soon? I mean, it's only been a year since his debut. He's not selling. - Maybe your promotional strategy is partly to blame. - What? We've put in 30 million yen. The video clip in London? Recording in LA? The expensive hotel in Vegas? We had our expectations for him. A compilation after only a year? He's only released 5 singles. 5 singles in 10 months. That's more than a lot. Oh yeah. Rock... folk... Samba... rumba... You just don't have your own style. You're the one who asked for them. - Then will you die, ifl ask you to? - What?! Mr. Bito, that was unnecessary. Mr. Mizorogi, you harassed one of our PR staff, didn't you? This is a serious problem. She's the only daughter of our holding company's executive. All week, it's been a battle trying to smooth it over. We're cutting you off. The album sales will cover whatever you owe us. I understand, but it's still unreasonable. Don't worry. Just give us all the songs you have now. You'll have something to show your kids someday. We'll sell them cheap. Then, we'll sell the leftovers at dollar shops. Oops. Are you okay? I hear you get cramps. - You should watch yourself. - Mr. Bito, please... Come on, let's go. Look... let me talk to the other record companies. Don't bother. It's no use. You know how they're all connected. Remember Emi? Emi? The DJ we met in Mito. Yeah... She's working as a radio director in Tokyo now. I ran into her when I was promoting your songs. - We talked about you. - Yeah? What do you think of a stint as a radio host? Who, me? She's looking for a good voice for her midnight program. The job didn't mean anything then, so I didn't tell you. But it could be a great opportunity now. - Tetsu... - Yes? What am I? A musician. Give pep talks and introduce other people's music? I'm sorry. I can take shit from people... but I'll become less than shit ifl lose my pride. You're right. I'm sorry. I was completely out of line. As long as you understand. This is Mizorogi's 'Singing Highway'. Nerima Ward, Tokyo - 2003 It's New Year's Eve. To the truck drivers on the road tonight... ...drive safe. I wish you all a Happy New Year. Now, let's read some letters from the listeners. Thank you all for sending them in. Our first letter today is from 'Peter-san'. "L'm a big fan of your program." Thank you very much. "My mom tells me, marriage is not a word. It's a sentence... "a life-sentence. "She tells me to think things through..." Nice job everyone. Hey, that was really good. She's a fan of yours. I found her outside, so I let her in. Hello. I've been listening to your music since lbaraki. Yeah? May I have your autograph? - Pen. - Sure. Thank you very much. Dinner? Wow... Hey! I haven't come yet. Oh, I'm sorry. I always come fast. I see. So, this is how it feels when your partner comes first. But I can do it again, if you give me a minute. It's not bad... This weird feeling of achievement. And my leg isn't cramped. Cramped? Your name's Miki? My real name is Hajime Miki. I know. If we got married, you'd become... Miki Miki. Miki Miki. Sounds good. Miki Miki... I like it. I'm singing a song for Miki... I really like it. Nerima Ward, Tokyo - 2004 Good evening, this is Mizorogi. I have a special announcement tonight. I am happy to announce... that I was just married today. No, my wife isn't pregnant yet. I am turning over a new leaf, and working hard as a musician. To all my listeners, I'm grateful for your support. Okay, now it's time to read some letters. This one is from 'Muscle-San.' Here we go... "Ways to annoy waiters. "After each special, shout 'Garbage!' "Ask 'Are you a really bad singer... "'or a really bad actor?"' I'm sure these would work. Next Ietten . . - Great work. - Thank you. - Thanks. It's that girl, right? You didn't even tell Tetsu. He's feeling left out. Who cares. You're not happy for me? No, I am happy for you. You needed a change, right? I guess. Congratulations. I mean it. Shame on you. I know. What do you want for your wedding present? I'm releasing a new song. Play it for me on heavy rotation. You got it. - See you. - Yes, next week. Miki! Miki! Yes? Get my MD recorder and set it here. - What are you doing? - Making music. I can hear more clearly with my ears in the water. - Okay, I'll be right back. - Okay. What're you doing? Yours? Yes. What's this? A joke? - I shed my skin sometimes. - What?! My entire skin just falls off... after I have sex with the same man a few times. Skin...? But... This is like a cartoon. How...? It always happens when I'm asleep. "Always"? This is the 5th time. Now you know how many boyfriends I've had. That isn't the point here. I went to both a dermatologist and a psychiatrist. They both say it's impossible and they won't treat me. Well, honey, this is really... - This... - ls gross? I wasn't hiding this. But how could you believe this, without seeing it? This is a lot of skin, are you okay? I'm so touched... you still care about me? Yeah, you're okay? Yes, I'm fine. I can leave. I mean, this won't stop, so if you don't want me... - Don't be stupid. - I'll shed again. Everybody gets broken skin. This happens all the time. It's happened to me too. In the summer, when I was a kid, I got tanned at the beach. I tried peeling off my skin in one big piece. It was kind of fun. So, it's almost like the same thing here. You can peel off your skin in one big piece. Think about it that way. It's not gross. You could get famous. But you won't tell anyone, right? No, absolutely not. Is that such a big deal though? You wake up in the morning and find your wife's cast-off skin. You try it! - Okay, it's a bit shocking. - A bit? - Very shocking. It's just that she's so good for you. Your life seems so filled lately. And your new song is great. I think you owe her for some of that. I know. But she's been acting differently. After she shed... her attitude changed. It's like... I don't know. She changed. It's kinda funny hearing you complain though. - Maybe it's nothing... - Tetsu. - Right, I'll stop. Ursh! Why all these mothballs? It's your favorite costume. You don't want any moths on it. Where's my notation? My notation! This? It was important? You used it as a shopping list?! But it only says one note. Hey, listen... This "do" is very important to me. Do you understand? Okay, SOFFY- And why are you rolling my undenuear like that? They're not sushi rolls! I can put more in the drawer this way. Always complaining... Well, I' m sorry. Crazy... I'm going-- Crazy... I'm crazy for hen. - I like it. - Yeah? - Which studio? We made it independently. Studios hate it when they've had no say in the making. How did you record it? We took out a loan, the maximum amount. - I could have helped. - No... he wanted it just between the two of us. That's how much he's putting into this song. What's with the cloud on his face then? - Just post-marriage blues. - It's not like him. You're home. Hot tofu for breakfast? I'm cold and I felt like it. What are you doing? Does this belong in here? Yeah, it's burnable garbage. - So...? - Made it yourselves... Yes. We will handle the promotion ourselves, of course. All we ask is that you release it. The song isn't too bad. And we're still in the red with your promotional fees. I'll think about it. - Just assure us: no losses. - Yes, thank you. Although... he did punch me. And the release will require some effort. And he doesn't seem sorry at all. Oh, he regrets it. Come on. - I'm sss... - Huh? - I'm sorry. - You see? I hear you got married. One of your fans? Trying hard to act like a musician, then she won't run away. Right? You handle the returned CDs. We're just releasing it. Half the profit is ours. - Agreed? - Yes, thank you. Wait. Thank you. I'm so sorry. Try attracting more attention. Like, hit the clubs. That's for new faces. It's a great chance to start afresh. He's right. It won't sell unless people hear it. Put on a costume if you have to. - He's already got a wig. - Yeah, that's right! Listen... seriously though, would you do more promotions? A friend working at a CD shop offered us an unannounced gig. Of course it's unannounced. Nobody knows him. Will you? It's me. Ready? The shop needs to close early for the town meeting. They're closing at 2:30pm. I'm sorry. We only have time for one song. - That's enough. - Thank you. Good luck then. She's so hot... and I'm so crazy for hen The warmth of her body from just that one night... made burn marks across my heart I feel it all day and night. The happiness of being in love. The smile on her face as I wake up in the morning... it lifts my heart The chains of love. 'Two for 300 yen' By Mizorogi Two for only 300 yen. Two for only 300 yen. No, no, no... Oh, baby...

"'Cheese Cake' by Aerosmith, 'Big Cheese' by Nirvana, "But".- "But the biggest cheese would be Mizorogi..." - Hey! What the hell were you thinking? - Tetsu! I know I was asking a lot, but that doesn't justify this! - What are you talking about? Get out! - We're on air! That was my girlfriend. I asked her to help. And you just forced yourself on her! I didn't know. Cut to commercials? No, keep them on. You would've done it either way! I know of your bad habits. But you're married now. What about Miki? How can you do this? Remember what you said? You said you're turning over a new leaf. You haven't changed. You haven't changed one bit since lbaraki! Damn you and your 'Most Original Award'. You're on air, say something. Not here, Tetsu. Why not? - It's private. - What is? I just wanted to do it from behind! She always straddles me and comes before I do! I'm never satisfied! - I want to have sex my way! - Are you nuts? You could never understand! - I don't care if you're on top or bottom! - It's notjust the position! This is about my style! My style! - It can't change! - Screw your style! What did you say? You have to change... please. Get out. I never asked you to be my partner in the first place. Get out! Now, please listen to Mizorogi's new song... 'Two for 300 yen.' Enjoy.

What the hell are you saying? - We came together this far! - You don't belong with me! Just leave me alone! I can't stop what's happening. I can't stop this shedding, and... I feel like we're drifting apart. Are we drifting apart? How many times did you sleep with her? Today was the first. Liar! It takes a few times for her to shed. Once today, and a few times, some time ago. "Some time ago"? Not after you got married. Do you remember that girl in lbaraki? The girl chewing gum? Gum? The one showing her undenuear? That girl was Miki. You're kidding? So we met a few times. Today's the second time I saw her shedding. That means... she shed twice with me. Twice with you. That's four sheddings right there. That's right. I could use a few sheddings too. My guitar! What's that? Looks like a man... Humans are amazing. Yeah, amazing... Minato Ward, Tokyo - 2005 Everything3 great when you're around.
