BASED ON PIERRE NORD'S THE RHINE VIRGIN THE RHINE VIRGIN We had been in Düsseldorf for two days. We were loading wood. Only a few more hours of work and we were on our way to Strasbourg. When I saw him on the platform, I was shocked. He put his suitcase down, and chatted with the boss. So? What's so exciting? You, as always. Not too subtle and not very original. - Watching my father? - No, the guy talking to him. I've seen that face somewhere. - You've traveled a lot. - I'm sure I know him. If he's got something to ask my father he'll be out of luck. He's on edge this morning. Nothing better to do than eat apples? Who's that over there? As far as I know, he wanted me to take him to Strasbourg, that's all! - And you refused? - You know I can't take passengers. "Can't, can't"… Yep, can't. It's not me, it's their damn rules. Poor guy. He doesn't look too bright. No, he didn't look bright. He looked more like one of those drifters who have nothing left to hope for. Nothing left… or a miracle. And the funny thing is, for him, the miracle happened. No! Two broken legs, with what he'd risked… But that was a miracle, too. But, miracle or not, he was off to the hospital. No more talk of taking him. You'll have to hire someone now. I know a little about engines. That'll help you and it'd work out for me. I absolutely have to go to Strasbourg. If we're not gone in two hours it's done for today. - You have your documents? - Yeah. Weren't you in Brussels in 1939? Me? Uh, no. Not in '39, nor after. "Martin Schmidt," no, I can't take you. - Why not? - He doesn't have a visa for France. Ah, that's possible, but you have no choice. It's him or 48 hours late. And aren't we waiting for wood in Strasbourg? But how's he gonna get through customs? I'll take care of the customs officers. Come on. So say yes right now. Because you'll end up saying it anyway. He's right - it's good for all of us. Well, do whatever you want. Hire him. Gonna end up in jail for this. OK, we'll all be there, it'll be fun. - There you go, done. - Thank you. You're doing me a great favor. I'll go calm him down. Could say you're lucky. Ah… you wouldn't even believe how I am… My four days to Strasbourg left me time to find out where I'd seen him. I don't know why, but I felt it was important. He knew the work as well as I did. THE RHINE VIRGIN Old Meister noticed it right away. I tried to ask him questions, to corner him, but I might as well have been talking to a wall. Nothing out of him. Martin Schmidt. German subject. As someone who knows forged documents, I've got to admit it was well done. I was getting more and more interested in this guy. He is on the bridge. Soon as there's mystery around a man, women have to go take a closer look. I would have thought this one was more level-headed. Deep down they're all the same. From time to time she managed to get a few words out of him. However, one evening, I started to get a rough idea. I'm expecting the worst. Bankruptcy. Ledru Company, liquidated, and all of us on the streets of Strasbourg. - Eat while you're still on your boat. - Oh, leave me alone. Thirty years I've been sailing the Rhine. Five companies. None been run like this. Incompetent bastards… You won't change a thing, so eat. It's like they want to sink the company. - Who, Ledru? - No. Ledru's dead. Died in the war. Oh, if he was still around, we'd be the greatest company in the world. - Did you know him? - No, I worked for the Rhineland then. But I hear the others talking about him. He started the business himself from nothing. Take that away, it's cold. And since Ledru's death, who's the director? A pimp. Mr. Maurice Labbé. And she's worth more. Who's she? Ledru's old wife. She married Labbé. Oh, yeah, she wasn't a widow long. Those two make a nice couple. They know how to throw money around. When you're short, sell a barge. - You're bothering him with your stories. - No, I'm not. It's nice to know who your bosses are. - Right, Martin? - Of course. Say, you ever worked on a self-propelled barge? Huh? Yes, I did two or three trips before the war for a German company. On which boat? I know them all. Come on, get this stuff out so I can clean up. Oh, don't get upset, it's fine… Defending our pet, are we? - His past interesting to you? - Oh, it certainly isn't to you. He doesn't have much of an accent for a German. What do you know! But it's true. It's true. He doesn't have one at all. - So what? - What? Got nothing else to do than get in my way? Yeah, that's enough! The next day we passed the Lorelei. From the way he was looking, you could tell he knew the area. And maybe the vessels heading downstream, too. He was particularly interested in The Montachet. Especially when the boss shouted the company was finished, liquidated, sold. With a great deal of emotion, old Meister left his post. And without Martin we were heading straight for the rocks. He knew the channel as well as we did. The old man couldn't believe he was at the helm as if this was all he'd ever done all his life. In the evening we anchored in Koblenz. The next day, I learned a little more about him, but maybe he was lying. In life there are moments when nothing matters. It's all meaningless. You got nothing to lose and nothing to gain. Maybe nothing to lose or gain, but I think we have memories. A house, friends. A wife. Ah, don't get too imaginative. And don't imagine some romantic story. Ain't got one. Well, that's good. In Mannheim we stopped a little before dark, as planned. I still couldn't get anything out of him. He was down. I decided to take him with me to the ruins where there was a speakeasy. I counted on a few glasses of alcohol to make him talk, but he was wary. And I was the one who drank them. Don't you ever drink? Oh, I'm out of practice. You gotta get back into it. You gotta live. You'll forget. Forget what? I don't know… Can see you've had troubles… If I can help you, well… I don't look like it, but I have friends in high places. In very high places. Say, didn't we meet in Strasbourg? Before the war… you weren't there? No, you never saw me in Strasbourg or anywhere. I'm getting tired of your investigation, What's going on here? Nothing, we were talking. I'll figure it out… Well, take your time and have fun. Get out of here. Not buying, Sir. You have 'em? - I'll have them tomorrow afternoon. - We're leaving tomorrow morning. We won't leave. I'll arrange for it. You can count on me. A thousand dollars and five hundred florins. It's worth it. Can't you yell any louder? Don't worry, he won't talk to the cops. But he's buying himself a gun! Hey, Martin, stay with us! Here we go! I knew it. There should be some noise. Are you completely drunk or what? Look at this thing. You can't imagine how much money this represents. You couldn't understand. Come on, order a drink. Deserves a celebration. I'm going to make a call. I'm going to call Strasbourg. Call someone who sleeps too well… When I came back he wasn't there yet. He must have gone walking around. That was convenient for me. A little work to do. The boat couldn't leave in the morning. The dollar deal wouldn't happen until the afternoon. The noise must have woken her up. I always liked that girl. And I was drunk. - Come on! - What's the matter with you? Don't like me, huh? You like your mysterious man. I don't like louts! Defend yourself, I like that. You'll regret this once you sober up! Gonna make me squeal, huh! Everybody already is! Let me go! Let me go! Let her go since she's asking you to, come on. What do you want? Always obey women. Oh, you like work so much that you're rummaging around in the engine room now. Go on, get out of here. - Weren't too scared? - They're terrible when they're drunk. Thanks, though. - Don't tell my father. - Go on, go to bed now. Well, that's it, we can go. - We are only half an hour late. - Thank you. It hadn't taken him long to figure out how I messed up the motor. I'm sorry but I have to be in Strasbourg as soon as possible. To each his own, right? By the way… Didn't you lose this last night? He was showing off. But I could feel him worrying. Before Strasbourg I started to watch. When I saw your car, I went to look for him as we'd agreed. We're arriving in Strasbourg. Be careful, don't make fun of me. I told him ridiculous things about the basins so that he would turn toward you. But Maria came to get him, worried. Come in, Martin. As usual we got anchored in front of the office. Maria handled things very well with the customs officers. The old man has such a reputation, they only came for the sake of doing so. As for me, I had my little report to do. At the moment Martin is still in hiding, but he has to be careful. He can only go out at night. So during the day you have nothing to worry about. We have nothing to worry about. Even at night we don't. Because it's not him… Not him? No, it's not. There is a clear resemblance, yes. But your Martin is much bigger and much better! And the key ring? With the initials? Just a coincidence… Quite funny, actually. Many people have the same initials. You have the imagination of a novelist. Thank you for calling us from Mannheim to let us know. But it made for a very unpleasant time for us. For good reason. Had it been him. The situation would have been… so painful. Yes, it would have. Thank you again, I won't keep you any longer. My wife has been upset. I'll drive her home. It true you're selling everything? - I'll explain. - You owe me quite a bit, 10,000 marks. - Yes, I know. - Leaving Monday. Won't be back in France. I'm liquidating everything here. I need it first. The office, tomorrow night at seven. I'll be alone. Make sure you're there. Despite the troubles you must have at the moment… What are you going to do? I don't know. I don't think there are many options. Maybe you were wrong… after so much time. No. And Pietre knows I recognized him. Oh, Pietre, we can buy him off, or… Or shut him up. There would be someone else to silence. And permanently. Don't you think? But that would be self-defense! Why is he hiding? Who is he planning to shoot? Me? You? Have the courage to face the facts! - Mail for you to sign. - Can you give me a second? Here you go. The Meister girl coming up to the office. There you are. Oh, Maria! Come give me a kiss! It's nice to see a girl who doesn't look like a crane. We have to leave, Geneviève. - Go as far away as possible! - It's out of the question! Listen to me carefully. In a few weeks everything will be sold. We can do what we want. But with him coming back everything could fall apart. - Well, what then? - We have to act, Maurice. Act fast. I'm here every night to put things in order until midnight, to take inventory. In a month it'll all be over. Do you understand? This company is my whole life. I've been here for 16 years. I know about everything. Look at the kind of stuff she has! Cannes, Deauville, Baccarat, mink… That's where the money goes. And you wonder where they get so much from. - Well, from here. - From here? Think about it! Dirty deal! The company hasn't brought in a penny in two years. I have to tidy up the pigsty, you can come, they won't come back. Ooh, some air! Can you smell that perfume? It's a real tart's perfume. But first, what was she doing here? She never usually comes. Who is that, there in the picture? Well, Jacques Ledru. Can't you read? JACQUES LEDRU - MISSING IN GERMANY 1939-40 "Missing"… - Maybe he's not dead. - Oh… The searches didn't turn up anything, but you know, we tried everything. No, he's dead. You never know. But if Ledru was only missing, how could his wife marry Labbé? There's a legal time-limit. Oh, they didn't mind waiting. Married or not, it was already the same thing. Would you mind telling me about her? Mind? On the contrary, it'd make me feel better. Here, sit down. He took her away once. We never knew from where. THE RHINE VIRGIN Good evening. NO DOCKING THIS SIDE What do you want? Can't leave me alone, can you? You're like him, interested in what I'm doing, huh? You hide behind the door, investigating. - It's over. - What do you mean, "it's over"? I saw your picture in the office this afternoon. Ah. What about it? - What about it? - Did you talk to anyone? Don't play dumb. Look, you've already done me one favor, so do me another. Go away and forget about it. This is my business. No. When you see someone ready to do what you're about to do, you stop them! Oh thank you, that's very touching. But leave me alone. But why do that? Just go back to where you were and it'll all be fine. No. Nothing can go back to normal for me. Never again. And anyway, I lost. So… But you can't say that! Nothing is ever lost in life. There's always a way to pull through. At least try! That's your opinion. There's one thing you don't know, and that's that I have a goal. Revenge. And I'm finally going to achieve that goal. I don't care about the rest. Because when I see him in front of me like a coward, if you knew what I was waiting for, that moment… You made me talk, you are happy now. Hmm? Ah, you don't care. And then you won't care when you've killed him? And what if he wasn't really responsible to begin with? - He wasn't? - Before you do anything, go find your old secretary at the office. Anna is there very late. She'll tell you a lot of things. What things? It's not for me to tell you. Then you can do what you want. Oh, it's not worth it. I know enough as it is. - Are you still going to their house? - To my house. Jacques! Whatever you do… If I can help you later… Thank you. Customs officers. If they meet you they'll ask for your papers. Come on, I think you still need me. I'll walk you to the port exit. I'll get a coat. Customs officers. - Good evening, Maria. - Good evening. Hey, Maria's got a lover? Yes, she does. - Do you think her father knows? - I don't know. You can remove your arm. - You don't need me anymore. - Thank you. You're a good girl. - Well, good luck. - Thank you. Are you all right? Tell me! No, I'm fine. - But there were two people in the car? - Yes. They were sure you'd go out, they were watching you. Ah, so they know I'm here. That one failed, but… They'll be suspicious now. You're right, I'll go find Anna, but… Go in before the first one, because if she sees me she'll die on the spot. All right? What were you thinking? It was a mere accident. No one knew back then. And besides, he had forged documents. There was no risk. You're screwing everything up. Yes, but I don't want that. But there's no choice. If he really comes back you'll be penniless. I know. Thankfully you'll be in the same boat. Me? I'm his wife. He was dead, I remarried. My marriage to you is not a crime. We'll talk about it… - Will you shut up? - This is for you, you idiot. Then we let him start his life over, let him take it all back and we go tonight! With nothing? Oh, no. I knew what it was like to be without money before I married him. I wouldn't do that again, even for you. And I won't be an accomplice to this mess, even for you. Fine. I'll act alone. Tomorrow afternoon summon Meister and his daughter to the office - and keep them there an hour. - What will you do? Don't worry about it. If everything goes well, in 48 hours we'll be in the clear. - Jean, take the car into the garage. - Yes, sir. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hung up. Maybe he wanted to see if we were here. If he's called, he knows what he's dealing with. Look at you. You're pale. Maurice. Ever since Pietre phoned from Mannheim, you've been hiding something. If I don't have all the cards in my hand, I can't play. - Ledru was my friend once. - That's very moving. I'd have done all the dirty work for you. - You pushed me to do a lot, by the way. - I didn't have to push. That's true. But I never told you the last thing. I did it so I'd have you for myself. After the armistice in Germany, I saw Ledru again in a hospital. I was almost in a coma from my wound. I could hear well but I couldn't speak. - And he was on a repatriation mission. - He didn't recognize you? He did recognize me. But he recognized me as a German. So the next day I was sent with a convoy of prisoners to Poland. I don't know how I didn't die. I can't believe she knew about a story like that. And you're still defending her after everything I told you? This is not possible. Did being held prisoner drive you nuts? Then go and thank her! No, please… I'd imagined so many things about her, you've just ruined it all. I need time to get used to it. Look at him. He's trying to convince himself she wasn't in the car. Well, no she wasn't. She was… in the workroom! That's why she couldn't answer the phone. They were out separately. You know, you've never loved anyone to death, right? I haven't had the time to. I spend my life in this office. Come on, don't get angry. Ah, you remember, this is the second one I bought. Sold it last year. Mrs. Labbé needed a mink coat. Platinum, of course. Dry docks for two months. Damage. The company doesn't have the necessary funds. But that's your business after all. Maybe you'd like to know why it's come to this… What do you want me to do about it, huh? That's a hundred employees that'll be out of a job. Well, get me the books, we'll take a look at them. I have a feeling it'll be hard to go through them. - You did call them in at three o'clock? - Yes. I'd like to see them leave and make sure Pietre isn't lurking around. And what do you want to do? Save our money. See you later. - You're very cheerful. - Yes, it happens. It happens, it happens… Oh, I didn't expect to see you! - You didn't? - You didn't come this morning. I thought you'd disappeared. Did you go to bed late, maybe? JACQUES LEDRU - MISSING IN GERMANY DURING THE WAR, 1939-40 Get me… Get this and come back immediately. - Just this? - I make the comments. What'll I pay workers with on Tuesday? I'll have the money by then, so hurry up. - Ms. Berg. - Yes? Has anyone been here? I didn't see anyone, sir. Someone's smoked and searched here. I don't know, sir. Maybe a ghost… Jacques? Jacques! I'm so full of emotions. I didn't want to believe it was you. Why didn't you come right away? I'd hoped for this for so long. Did you know about what happened to me? He told me everything last night. I didn't think he was that bad. Jacques… You don't think that… I swear, you hear? I swear I didn't know anything. And last night you were in the car? Yes, he'd forced me to go. I didn't know why. I understood when he drove off. It was horrible! The car was almost on you when I was able to get the wheel! You believe me, don't you? No. What's your point? First of all I want to know what you want to do, why you're hiding. You see, I could lie to you, tell you that I love you. I don't know where I stand anymore. I could never forget you. You suddenly returning… everything between us. And since when did you become his mistress? After the war. I suffered so much from your death… I mean, from your disappearance. I was so lonely, lost. And then, the company, all the responsibilities… He was tender… attentive. Try to imagine, Jacques. But before? Before my death. What filthy gossip have you listened to? Why should I listen to you, eh? - Because I've always loved you, Jacques. - Now, you're laying it on a bit thick. I was wrong, yes. But never mind. In any case I paid dearly for it. Very dearly. But since last night I've been afraid. I can help you, Jacques. Help me? You can't do anything to him, you can't prove anything that happened in Germany. You can kill him, of course. But that won't get you anywhere. I know all his dealings. But be quick, because Maurice is capable of anything. - Do you have any proof? - Plenty. Trust me. Come to the villa tonight at nine o'clock. I'll give you some letters and papers. Afterwards you can do what you want with me. Oh, that. I'll go anyhow, because I have to get it over with. Don't ring, I'll leave the little door open near the chapel. I'll wait for you in the office, it'll be ready. I warn you that if you try to trick me you'll regret it. You'll see that I haven't lied to you. Seeing you again, in this house… In our house. You remember? There are other memories here now, eh? If you still care about me, anything is possible. Tomorrow it'll all be straightened out. We'll be together again, like before. I've found you again, Jacques. Go away, the others are coming back, there's no need for them to find you here. Do you still doubt me? No, of course not, because I'll come later. So… - So? - Get in quickly. I'll explain. He came to tell us that we're washed up. And that's all it means you? Mrs. Labbé drives well. Finally, do you realize that after this trip it's over? To find a boat at my age… You can still run around… Yes, OK, OK… - What do you want? - To see the boss. - The boss isn't here. - He'll come, I have an appointment. - I don't know why, I don't think so. - I do. He's too wise to miss certain appointments. Yes. Well, wait if you want to. But outside. The company is closed. You'll miss your books when the company is sold. Civil servant! Well then… leave me here. But you're an hour early… Yes, I'd rather know what's going on beforehand. Don't do anything stupid. You'll come back after? Yes, but don't wait, it may take a while and I have work at the office. I'll come back around midnight if lights are on. You can see the windows from the boat. Good luck. You took this money from the office? Can I know what for? It's my business, after all! But admit it, you were leaving. You would've left without me. Yes. And no matter what you do, you won't stop me. Like a coward! Like a thief! Oh, you can't do that! You can't leave me! It's over, understand? You disgust me. And for someone to disgust me… But I need you, Maurice. You know I love you… You're incapable of loving anything but money. You can't. I've done everything for you! If I love money so do you. I was always taking it from Jacques to give it to you! That's what you wanted! That's all! Yes. Maurice, it's not true, is it? You didn't lie to me all this time? If it's any consolation, I did love you. I've proved it, I think. But now, that's over. For quite some time. - When we got married… - I did to Jacques what I told you. But I wouldn't have done it just for the money. And when I think that in the beginning I could have killed if you'd asked me… I'd be in quite a mess! You're a pimp! A dirty little pimp! Your old vocabulary coming back to you. Be careful, it gives you away. Maurice! You won't get away with this. That would be too easy. Put the tickets on the desk. Hurry up! You definitely want to kill someone tonight. Always take the safety off. He'll come, I don't know what he'll do with me… I have nothing, nothing left! Well, you'll get away with it, you'll do what you did before. As far as filth goes, you're quite good. You heard everything? Nice family. Didn't you want him to leave, Jacques? So you could get your revenge. Well, when I came here I thought maybe I'd shoot you both. Ah, it was really not worth it. And that's what ruined my life. That's it. It was almost funny, your little talk. You see, for once you care about a guy, he gets cold feet, dumps you. You played the wrong card. What are you gonna do? Kick you both out of the house right now. You're going to clear my place together because you'll stay together. And that'll be my revenge. She's not ready… Watch out, Jacques! The funny thing is I should thank you. You must've known about it. Why did she send for me? She wanted me to shoot you when you entered the grounds, like a vagrant. Officially, you weren't back. You would've only been recognized later. Yes… It was good, well thought-out. And last night, who was driving? She was. But it was me who straightened the steering wheel. Once again, thank you. I couldn't help it. Of course that takes more courage than your ordinary little tricks. Because courage… well! Oh, I was lucky. It's not that, Jacques, I want you to understand. In any case you have until morning to leave or it'll cost you dearly. Because this time seven years of bad luck is good for both of you. Jacques! Jacques! Jacques! Wait for me. Jacques! Don't do it. Don't do it! Stop! Anna. You sleepy? Did you go with them when they went out? No. We can't find the gun, he must've taken it. And they had a violent argument once in the garden? Very violent. I heard voices but I didn't understand the words. And then, there was the gunshot. - And you came out immediately? - Yes. Jacques was still holding the revolver. I ran out, and Maurice was lying there. When he saw Jacques he moved away. Did you notice which door Jacques Ledru used to escape? Through that one. Thank you, madam. That'll be all. Captain, I wanted to tell you… Jacques Ledru is on The Rhine Virgin. He won't leave for Germany until Monday morning. In his anger he told us so himself. Thank you. We'll do what's necessary right away. Mrs. Labbé. Before you called us, are you sure you didn't touch anything? I'm certain, sir. Mrs. Labbé claims Ledru went out that way. That's not possible. That door has been locked for months. Look at the rust. Come on. Hey! He'll make it. - You sure? - Yes. It'll be hard, but… We'll sleep a little and then start again at ten, OK? We'll have to. My house isn't sold yet, you know. And what are you going to do about the other two? That's been done since last night. Is that where you were earlier? Yes, liquidation. It's all settled for good. For good? What kind of foolishness have you done now? What? Guérin is not a bad guy, but when he's after someone… And it's you he's after, isn't it? But… I don't see why. But in any case don't go over there. They'll want to know who you are. You entered the country illegally. Oh, it doesn't matter now. It does matter! If you show up again, you won't have any peace. Those who want to buy will take advantage. Now's not the time. Well, go see what's going on. Be careful, though. They might come here. But there's no reason for them to come. Come on. If I could only be sure… What more do you want me to say? You been searching around, he's not here! I didn't sleep well. I would have heard him come in. You both are getting along well to hide him like you have. - He's a nice boy. - That nice? Well, whether his name's Ledru or Schmidt, I don't care. And if that guy shot Labbé, well, he did a good thing. And if I can I'll help him. Absolutely! Don't get worked up… You still have the same pig face, huh? Meanwhile, a stowaway… Stowaway? If you tell me it's Ledru, I believe you. If I gave my boss the slip you can't blame me. OK then. Well, I'll search the harbor. And the company office. Who are you looking for in my office? There's nobody there. I was just there. At this time? And I stayed there all night. You may know that it's being sold. I have a lot of work for Mr. Labbé. Well… don't wear yourself out. He was killed last night. One good thing that's happened. Well, then. Sounds like he was well-loved. And can we know who killed him? Jacques Ledru. What a shame he's been dead for eight years! Did you get him drunk? - Go ahead and laugh. - You got a warrant for my office? Come on Maria, cheer up. Shall we check the office? No hurry. If it's him it won't be around here, he'll be back. We'll look later. You, come with me. You two, stay here. Bought a couple hours. He can't stay here. I can't believe he did this. But his wife saw him. Then she called the police. Look, you know what? If you can handle it he'll tell you more than me. You're going to go there. I'll meet you there and… I'll figure out a way to get him out. - But the cops will see him go home. - I'll keep 'em busy. Why not? If he can bail out the company… I won't let him get caught. Go on, get dressed quick. Hey, fellas! Wanna drink? Oh, I'd love one, but we're on duty! If you want to do what you do, you'll do it just as well here and you'll see better! OK! We're coming! As I was leaving, I turned around. He was sitting on the bench, he had his revolver next to him. Well? Don't stand at the window. They could see you. I'm getting tired of hiding, it's been going on for seven years… The guards, the camps… And then if I go find them it'll start all over again. Investigations, trials… it'll go on for months. Then prison. And then… And then, all this sold, you know. That bitch! Well, if it's not you, who is it? - It's probably her. - Her? But come on, she loved him! Maybe, but don't forget he ditched her. And to think that I left relieved. I felt free. For me life was new again. If what you told me is true it still is. We'll do everything we can to get you out of here. Funny, it was you I was thinking about when I came back. Me? Yes, like something clean that came into my life after all that crap. You're a nice girl, Maria. A very nice girl. Yes, I know. I'm a good girl. You offended? No. No, not at all. No, but it's true, you've done me a lot of good. I think that without you I'd give up, then go to the police because… the company… alone… You've given me the will to fight. Let's talk about something else, shall we? - That's all I needed. - Yes. Hadn't you realized that yet? Take a good look at me, Maria. I'm 45 years old. With terrible years behind me, but that count double. I'm worn out, tired, Maria. And very stupid. Could knock before you enter… If the police came would they knock? I don't think you were the killer, but for now the result's the same. There are agents. Before tonight they'll be here. Yes, well… - Gotta see that bitch Geneviève quickly. - Are you crazy? As soon as you leave you'll be picked up! Well, she's going to come here. Go wait for me in front of the gate. I wouldn't be surprised if they were all in on this. The widow, - Anna… - What makes you think that? What? A story about a door. If they were in cahoots, she wouldn't blame Ledru. Yeah. That's what bothers me. Unless… See? From here the tree hides the villa. So from the villa you can't see the bench. I've got to find Ledru. - Get a search warrant for the office. - Yes. It was in the mirror. - I'd like to know what she's hiding. - Who? Mrs. Maurice Labbé. Come on. That's all for here. Here. I've come to present my condolences to Mrs. Labbé. And she says that without laughing! She's sick! She's worked up! You want to see me, miss? I'm listening. It might be in your interest that we're not heard. - I don't understand. - You'll understand very soon. I accompanied Mr. Ledru here last night. - I didn't see you. - I stayed on the grounds. - Then you were present at the crime? - Yes, I saw it. We saw you kill Labbé. Is that your version of saving Jacques? It's as good as yours to accuse him. False testimony, in short. Would that shock you? Do you have any proof? None, you see. You don't have any more. You are the only witness and there are two of us. Our account is as good as yours. What do you say? Should I call? Why would I kill Maurice Labbé? Well, that… You'll ask the police the question and answer it yourself. Oh, I forgot. I was also with him the night with the car. They'll be amused. - Blackmail? - If you like. I have no money, miss. It's not that. Jacques wants to see you this time. - Where is he now? - You'll see him. - I don't want to see him. - I'm afraid you have no choice. - What does he want with me? - He'll tell you himself. Suppose I tell the police you know where he is? Do it. But don't forget to tell them about the bullet that broke this mirror. Come on, hurry up. You don't have much time. Fine. She won't come. She'll come. You'll see. Don't you think it's quite risky? You see another way? And today, there's nobody on site. So… Be careful. I'll come by the villa in the evening. Alright, then. Too bad it didn't work out. Would have saved you a lot of trouble. - Did Maria explain it to you? - Yes, it's despicable. Isn't it? Well… that's life. Do what you want. But you won't get away. Maybe. In the meantime you'll take me to the villa. Because it's the only place they won't look for me. And then we can talk together. And if I refuse? What if I warn them? Ah, I might be arrested, but you soon will be. Chances are you'll stay that way longer. So, you're gonna be nice and do what I tell you. Come on. Hey there, stop! Go see. Show yourself. Do what I tell you. Oh, Mrs. Labbé, I didn't recognize you. - Can I leave? - Of course, madam. Excuse me. Oh, sorry. Thank you. As a matter of fact I was out. There was a visitor. Oh, the maids don't come on Sundays. - And who smokes so much? - Smoking… It's poor Mr. Labbé. That's all we have left of him. - You really have nothing to say? - Oh, I do! But that would be rude. And what if I don't believe he's guilty? That would be… At least some intelligence on your part. Why didn't you say she came to your place earlier? You didn't ask me. Besides, I haven't seen her. She only comes here when she needs money. And she can't be short of it after all the money I gave to Mr. Labbé the day of the crime. - A large sum of money? - You didn't know that? More than 700,000 francs. Here. A few hours before he was killed. Poor man. You wouldn't have found it, by chance? Hey. You knew Labbé when you were at the port. - He ever give you cigarettes? - Yes, often. - Blue ones? - No, they were always American ones. Nothing unusual up there. After you killed him you took the money. Are you lying for her? You took the money. Oh, I thought so, too. He didn't have it on him when I found him. How did you find him? Said you saw me shoot him. You're contradicting yourself. You killed him after I left. You gonna talk? Let me go! I didn't kill him! You did. What are you talking about? He left you for someone else and took your money. And by accusing me you got rid of me. No, I thought of that afterwards. After what? After the shot. When I found him dead. Well? Did you see me shoot or not? No… but it could only be you! I'm sure she's sincere. She believes it was you. I believed her. Even if you didn't kill him, we're in the same boat. What about this? Did you explain to them how it broke? Who did it? Shoulda come up with a story. They've probably found the bullet. You're bluffing! Doesn't matter if I didn't see you do it! There were only three of us here. Don't stay here. I'm gonna go see. If it's the police I suggest you shut up. Well, I see we're going to the same place. Good evening. Go upstairs. Finally. I feel like you're beginning to realize. Excuse me, I'll go in first. Hello madam. I'm not on duty. I just came by to check on you. Looks like the police are doing a bad job. Thank you Captain. I'm very tired. Is there anything new? No… nothing important. Just details. However, it wouldn't be impossible to have a forthcoming arrest. Are you on his trail? I didn't say it was Ledru. These old mirrors always give out on us sooner or later. But I wouldn't want to bother you any longer. I'm happy to see that you're not alone. But we have to support each other. The company is a big family. Thank you for coming. It was the least I could do, madam. Least I could do… Captain, I'll see you out. This is what's called a psychological attack. Jacques. I heard the captain, I think she's going to talk now. But tell me, did you really think I was lying? Yes. You find so many excuses… So, you know, for me, whether you're guilty or not doesn't change anything. Oh, I don't even blame her anymore. For me, it's like she never even existed. Even the other day when she came on the boat, I knew… Well, actually… How did she know I was on the boat? Tell me… who told you that I was on the barge? Pietre, the sailor. He had phoned Maurice from Mannheim to warn us. I went to the port to identify you. And that's why Pietre was always at the office. You told me about deals the other day. Was that true or not? It was true. And Pietre here, did he know about that? Yes. They were smuggling currency together. Maurice was afraid of him. Even the night of his death he refused to see him. Oh, because he came here? Why didn't you say so before? I was sure you had killed him and I thought it didn't matter! And what time did he come? You remember? Not long before you. Half an hour, maybe. And do you know what he wanted? Money. Maurice owed him money. That's also why he didn't want it known he was here. And then… we were waiting for you. Yes, thank you, I remember. And it was a large sum? According to Maurice, yes. It wasn't really you who took the money when you found Maurice? No, Jacques. He didn't have it on him anymore. Are you sure you heard an argument? Yes. But I didn't recognize the voices. I was on the stoop there. And then? Go on, come this way. Dubus, keep an eye on our agents. Watch the house until dawn. We'll come and relieve you. Let me know if the Meister girl and the secretary go out. If Pietre waited, he saw me come in. Seeing I would leave, there was only one place he could look out for me. It was there. He was probably behind the thicket. Labbé was sitting there, and when I turned around, he had put his revolver down next to him. So Pietre only had to reach for it. And where did you find the body? There, behind that bush. Well, they must have taken a few steps while arguing. That's what you heard. He'd come to ask you for his money and he'd seen Maurice in the library putting the wads in his pockets, so it was tempting. So, he fired, took the money, and then had time to escape through the door I'd left open. We didn't find the revolver. He must still have it if I'm not mistaken. He surely doesn't. Hmm. Is he on the boat now? No. He always comes back ten minutes before departure. Well, I'll give it a try. You get back, and tomorrow, it'll all be clear. If not I'll turn myself in to the police and it'll be up to them. But you'll never find him at night in town. It's not about that. Let me do this. Go on, run along now. Isn't it too dangerous? No, but… If it doesn't work we may not see each other for a while. And in a prison visiting room there are things you can't do. See you later. - It's the Meister girl, phone the boss. - Got it, boss. Are you coming at this time? We're leaving in half an hour. Still have to get the oil. There's no answer. Stay on, stay on. - And the boat will leave… - Exactly. Hello? Hello, customs? Go get the car. Hello, would you please take a note? The Rhine Virgin is leaving in ten minutes. Yes, The Rhine Virgin. But that doesn't matter! Hello? Hello, foreign currency is hidden on board. And there's money that was taken from Mr. Labbé, too. Of course Meister is honest, and he's not the only one! Yes and… hello? Hello, you'll also find Maurice Labbé's killer. Oh! You hold! This is Anna Berg on the line! Jacques Ledru's secretary. Don't worry, they'll go there. Come on, now. A joint operation between customs and the police. Departure of motorized officers at 6:16 a.m. in planned formation. Vehicle with license plate number 59-12-B67 is heading to Strasbourg. Hello, P.C.? This is BM4, we're going through the open bridges. This is BM4, pursued vehicle has just passed in front of Saint-Paul. Reported vehicle is taking Rhine Road, we still have contact. Crossing the Vauban basin. Hello, customs? Hello? Rhine Virgin spotted in the industrial basin. Search various oil stations. What? You want to visit the boat? Got a report. Well, let them, let them search all over. Stop this one first. You'll still have me. I don't have to take orders from you. Boss! Search between the cars over there. - Didn't see him? - We searched all over. - And you? - Nothing either. He's over there! Go! Stop that crane, for God's sake! Jacques… Jacques, I'd like to tell you… The only thing I have to tell you is that you can leave. Consider yourself fortunate. Don't look back. You're right. I have much better things to do now. So? Are you the boss or not? Don't worry. I'll explain it to you later. Subtitle translation by: K. M. Kownacki
