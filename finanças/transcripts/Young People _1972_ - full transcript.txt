Inthe real performance... if we get such a measly applause, it'd be so bad! Ok, stop clapping She is our loyal audience Do you like music? You are not our team member Please don't disturb us I want to join your team Look, your hair is longer than boys Of course it should be Look at you, so pathetic! What can you do? The word around is that... every student in this school can join That's right, but you forgot that ... everyone who wants to join should pass the test Test? Yes, the test comprises of three parts Don't get scared, that's easy First, you can choose singing or dancing I sing Yesterday a child came out to wonder, What a silly girl! Caught a dragonfly inside a jar. Fearful when the sky was full of thunder;, and tearful at the falling of a star. And the seasons, they go round and round. And the painted ponies go up and down. We're captives on the carousel of time. We can't return, we can only look behind from where we came and go round and round in the circle game. Then the child moved 1 0 times round the seasons, skated over ten clear frozen streams. Words like when you're older, must appease him. And promises of someday make his dreams. and the seasons, they go round and round. And the painted ponies go up and down. We're captive on the carousel of time. we can't return, we can only look behind from where we came and go round and round and round in the circle game. Sixteen spring and sixteen summer gone now, Cartwheels turn to cartwheels through the town. And they tell him take your time it won't be long now, And drag your feet to slow the circle down. and the seasons, they go round and round. And the painted ponies go up and down. we're captive on the carousel of time. we can't return, we can only look behind from where we came and go round and round in the circle game. So the Years spin by and now the boy is twenty, Though his dreams... have lost some grandeur coming true. There'd be new dreams may be better dreams and plenty. before the last revolving year is through. and the seasons, they go round and round. And the painted ponies go up and down. we're captive on the carousel of time. we can't return, we can only look behind from where we came and go round and round and round in the circle game. and go round and round and round in the circle game. That's good Look at her She doesn't seem to know singing Hey, then you seem to sing very well Perhaps you sing Are you kidding?

I want to join the Chinese kung fu team Don't worry They will not let you in Yes, they don't want me Hung Wai We are always bullied by others Don't you think so? Yes... Didn't you listen to the song a while back? What the world needs is love ... not fight! Practising Chinese kung fu is not only for fighting Okay Boys, please follow me I wanna show you something And the girls would remain here to practise Okay, follow me Are you a boy? Where do we go, Hung Wai? My home Can't Po-erh go there too? You want to stay with her ... or come with us? Well, who needs you? You go with them You're the temporary incharge of the Music Team ... as we have other things to do Look, Lei He and Jin Fei follow him everyday You wouldn't like such girls, would ya? Why not? Be careful Lam Tat, it's not a big deal with a car Why don't you buy one? Hello How's Lam Tat's car, Ho Tai? Very expensive You know this is one hell of a car! Monster Lam Tat Coach Wong Coach Wong Good Come on, I want to talk to you Coach Wong... Good... If Ho Tai was not there that day You'd be unable to participate in the competition However, I didn't hear that... he told anyone about this He is a quack doctor not having real medical skill Reckon that counts for nothing You are wrong Chinese kung fu is long and lasting Its value is undeniable Come on Nice place, Hung Wai Have you ever placed a signboard here? What was your family business? Day nursery You ask us here to take care of the children Nobody at home in the morning I don't have key. Let's climb over Alright, go ahead Quick, be careful of the pillar If a cop were to pass by... I don't think you would laugh so loudly What is this? For day nursery Childrens' toy of course Go Why is your home like this, Hung Wai? Hung Wai said it was a day nursery Are these swings for the children? Oh my God! How can you tell me this is a day nursery? Follow me Come on Come on, beat me up Really? You first We go together Come on... Let's go Come on, Gou Stop How can you call this a day nursery? Those who come here must be little spiders They are so smart still have another one Let's practise What's the matter, Hung Wai? My father is a master of martial arts and he launched the "Plum Blossom Pugilism" At first this used to be a famous martial arts school Your father is the very famous Hung Wing Yan An old hero What are you doing? Taking action film? I've heard it before Why don't you ever tell us, Hung Wai? You know kung fu? It's not worth a mention In memory of my father I keep all this stuff Gou envies Ho Tai and Lam Tat We can practise Okay, practise together Come on, practise Come on... You are wrong, Gou Channel all your energies to your fist and then hit; like this Practise makes perfect We'd do well to start with the basics From now on... we'll always come here to practise Good idea...okay... Okay, we'll come here everyday Yes... How's the practice going these days? Not good Everytime I practise alone Hung Wai never comes However, I always accompany you here Remember, Hung Wai is the captain You like Hung Wai, Po-erh? I like everyone Will there be someone special? Yes Who? Not anyone but singing Playing "Plum Blossom Pugilism", always stay calm but when you move, you have to act 5 movements at once ... and every movement with power Look Good... I understand You can easily cope with five guys at least This pugilism helps train your physical flexibility ... and your prompt judgement Look at the pattern how the bag moves There isn't any rule, right! Make the right decision ... and then fight it back; Or you will be knocked out! This theory is applicable to everything Gou, you try Try Me? Just try, Gou Okay Again No... I can't do that Again No, no way What do you feel, Gou? Let me finish it first Okay... Come on, folks I am nearly starved to death I met Lam Tat yesterday Princess was with him all the time If Ho Tai wins the Martial Art Competition will Princess follow him all day? I think Princess will follow everyone ... except Gou No necessarily so Princess doesn't follow Gou but Gou can follow Princess What are you doing? Stop arguing Carry on your practice after lunch Okay... Oh no! Look Ho Tai must be visualizing... the scene that he has got the first prize Still a long way to go! The qualifying match will go on for 1 2 days and... then got to the finals of the knockout competition Ho Tai has to pass more than ten rounds He'll certainly be able to manage it Good... Good Hurray... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 6, 7, 8, 9, 1 0 No. 47 competitor Ho Tai defeated the opponent winning the first round and got to the second round of the match Good...

All of them were broken Good I don't understand this Nine pieces of lipstick, nine boxes of compact Nine bottles of perfume They are for the girls For the girls of course Great You can manage nine girls at the same time? Don't misunderstand me, brother Those nine girls... are the team members of Music & Dance Club We have other things to do this month we were sort of afraid that they will get angry Hence we bought them presents I am not able to have nine girlfriends Okay Then the boys stay here and ate up more than 200 pounds of bread ... within one month? Hung Wai, are you practising kung fu? I always know you practise on your own I won't stop you because you know how father died Now you practise with your classmates To be frank, I object it Relax, brother We are only training our physical flexibility It ain't for fighting! We are all good students You claim that 200 pounds of bread, nine bottles of perfume You boy Can you stop, Lam Tat?
