Mom ! Honestly, that's great, right? Tinja, stop! You are not possible! I hope your life is great, like ours. Goodbye. Hi. It has to be brought out. It's not serious. Matias. Grab it ! Tinja. - Outside ? - Bring it here. I want to see him. Watch out for broken glass. Watch ! Go throw it away, sweetie. With compost. Come on ! Hi, my name is Reetta. And me, Tinja. We just moved in. I want to say, I'm sure it shows. Can I pet him? Sure. Nasty ! Roosa! You can not do that. I'm sorry, she never bit anyone. She hurt you? No, it was my fault. Alli's baby Sing louder, mom. Stronger ! Even stronger. Alli's baby A small bird Alli's baby A small bird no dad no mom no one to take care of you no dad no mom He is sleeping. Is this the new video from your blog? Yes. I haven't quite finished. Hello and welcome to my blog Our Great Life, about an ordinary Finnish family. You'll see, it's great. I am married and a mother of two children. My daughter Tinja, a super gymnast who will soon be playing his first competition. I'm a little worried but I'm very proud of her. What ? My foot was not strained. He was like that instead of being like that. I'll cut the shot, it won't show. A new family has moved in next door. It's nice. - Did you talk to them? - Yes. Only to their daughter, Reetta. She invited me to her house tomorrow. She has an adorable little dog. Did you tell him that you were focusing on your competition? Is that still your priority? Yes, the competition above all. I will help you. Go ahead. It's good. You didn't do the flip at the end. I know. You hesitate, you have to trust yourself. Sorry. You don't have to apologize but for the competition, you have to make it. - I can start over. - We stop there. Don't stress, okay? You come ? I have to go for a run. Drop it. It's useless, she always says no. Have fun. Hi. I present to you Tero. Hello. Go get changed, honey. Hello. Hello. How was the training? Very well. So much the better. I have a surprise for you. I like. You will impress them. You surprised us. Sometimes when you're an adult, you have friends... a bit special. What about Dad ? Well... Dad, it's dad. You know how he is. Yes. It stays between us, all that. OK ? I am away for a few days. But don't forget, it's a girl's secret. Hi. It smells good here. But how pretty! Mom, we made you waffles. Come on, that's enough. Matias, enough is enough. Well done, you got both of our clothes dirty. How was your business trip? Yes, it was great. Hello. Do you have a problem, Tinja? No nothing. Mom told you about her trip? Yes. Thanks to this seminar, she will be able to improve her blog. Well fine. It's a short story. - Looked. - It's nice. - Very well. - Great, Tinja. You arrive there. There is still a place in the competition. Last candidate. What's your name ? Reetta. Hi. Gosh, that's crazy! Go ahead, Reetta, it's your turn. Yes. It was perfect. Start again. Once again. Still. Still. Come on, Tinja, one more time. I have to close. We'll take care of it. Don't overdo it, Tinja. It's okay. We're back, sweetie. It's good like this. Tuck in your stomach, straighten up. Arms symmetrical, back straight. And don't forget the chin. Well done, Tinja. I was thinking that we could do a live of the competition. It's okay, I'll take care of you. We really feel our bond. People love it. Can I tell you a secret? I think so... that I'm in love. I want to say... For years, I have sacrificed myself for others, as if it was the role of women. But this... It's just... Tero is the best thing that ever happened to me. For the first time in my life, I feel like I love... sincerely. I want to see where it takes us. You understand ? Yes of course. I was sure of it. I will be away again next weekend. Tinja? Everything is fine ? How are you ? Tinja. What happened ? How are you ? A bird. A bird has entered. I believe he was injured. What was a bird? I dunno. A very big one. What are you doing ? Go away. I have to pee. Go out. I'm afraid. Ouch! Tinja... Go away. Alli's baby poor little orphan Alli's baby poor little orphan What does it smell like? Tinja is a shit. Matias, let your sister answer. What ? Why you... Good... You stopped Matias from going to the bathroom. Tinja is a shit. We're not here to fight. Suddenly, Matias wet the bed. I will change the sheets. Tinja went out tonight. What ? It's true ? No. Something else ? No I think not... Oh... Good... OK. Yes. I see. Come, Matias. Do you have a bird? No. We might take one. You didn't come today. Where ? In training. I have... I forgot. She is hairy. Are we going back together? There was a very big storm. With high waves like that. The sea was stormy, it was incredible. Can you help me put up these posters? Roosa ran away yesterday. Oh yes ? I meant, thin. There you are. And me, I have nothing? Thank you, it's very nice. And me ? I didn't bring you anything, my cat. Your hair is all tangled. How they grew! Matias. What is... It's the neighbors' dog. Tinja buried him. - Where did you find this? - Tinja killed him! - A beast did this. - No, it's Tinja. Matias, don't lie. Go to your room. Right now ! Tinja. What happened ? Mom ! You can't do that, understand? It's understood ? Who are you talking to ? All alone. That... How are you ? Yes. What does it smell like? It is... It's the dog. Can you explain to me? I dunno. Who did that ? Matias? Answer. No... it was an accident. Mom... do you want me? I thought competition was as important to you as it was to me. I told you no. Did you say "Alli"? Tinja. Ally. You are cold ? Tinja? Mom, Tinja is a freak! You had another nightmare. It wasn't a nightmare, it was real. Hello. Looked. You are beautiful. Thank you. Over to you, Reetta. Tinja, in support. No need. It's good. I will see my classmates again. We haven't seen each other for too long. I miss them. Did you find your dog? Shame. You were fine. Thank you. Do you want to participate in the competition? Yes, if I am qualified. Tinja is going to have to train hard if she wants to beat you. Right, Tinja? - I'll take you ? - No, I'll walk. It does not bother me. No, I like to walk. Goodbye. Mom. Turn back. Mom, turn around. Tinja! What's the matter with you ? Tinja. Everything is fine. I understand. I know what you're feeling. I too was anxious before my skating competitions. It was very stressful. Do you know how to get rid of stress? Nope ? Win the competition. Show everyone you're the best. Be sure of yourself and no one will doubt it. You won't have to worry about anything anymore. I have an idea. Being home doesn't help you decompress. We could spend the weekend at Tero's then. Would you like to ? Ally! Take. Have you lost weight? You're not a chubby baby anymore. When you've eaten, get ready. We're going to Tero, you and me. Your mother has an iron will. I have always respected that she knew what she wanted. It's easy to live with her. Yes. Tero is a good guy. I mean, humanly. It's great, right? Hello. Nice to meet you. We've met once before. It's nice that you came. They look like twins. Mom has great taste. It's true. Welcome. Make yourselves at home. It's great here, right? A bit under construction but... Want to see your room? Let's go see Helmi first. Come. What do we have here? She's cute, isn't she? A real little princess. How nice and pretty you are. Tero is a widower. Helmi's mother died at birth. But you got us now, right? Yes. Everything is fine. Move your hands a little. Like that. Do you really have to photograph everything? What if I don't want to show my house? No one will know it came from here. Look, I cut you out of the picture. You are an adorable little princess. Here we put it on you. You are so pretty in this outfit. Yes sweetie. Hello ? Yes ? Eat, please. OK. Where ? - Do you like it? - Yes. It's not serious. Look, what if I do this? Whoops. Gosh ! Helmi, show him how well-behaved we are. Whoops. I see. I mean...it's awful. Reetta. What a tragedy ! And just before the competition. Above all, don't let it upset you. Why did you do that ? Why ? Get off me, Alli! Let go of me ! What's the matter ? Nothing, I was looking at the chair. She is pretty. Yes, I found it in a dumpster. People don't take care of their business. I like to fix what's broken. By the way... I wanted to give you this later but as much as you have it now. With the competition approaching. Thank you. That's a wheel. And that, an air wheel. How are you ? Yes. Wait, let me start again. I can do better. You don't have to. I can do better. It does not matter. What do you mean ? Do you really like the gym? It's a good sport. Yes... It's probably important to your mother that you succeed. Wanna see me cartwheel? What was that ? I'm going to change. Everything is fine ? Tinja, open up to me. Tinja. I will call your mother. Tinja! Open! Open! Stopped ! Do you have something to tell me ? I packed my bag. I can wait for mom to come back or I can take the bus if you want. You will never see me again. Nobody is going anywhere. You must find me monstrous. You are not monstrous. At last... - You were earlier. - Sorry. It's not serious. I accept your apologies. You've been going through a lot lately. We'll talk about it with your mother. No Please. Don't tell him, I'll do whatever you want. Is it because of the competition? No. I want to say... You can tell me about it. Hello, are you ready? We check your postures and let's go. I will start filming as soon as I warm up. Did you hurt yourself? Yes, an accident in the workshop. I told you to be careful with your tools, honey. Shall we go, sweetie? Stretch your feet like you showed me. Arms against ears. Make an effort. Tinja, you can do better than that. It's a matter of focus. Sorry, sweetie. Were you woken up? Tinja was making too much noise, right? Who is his mum's little cabbage? Who is it ? Come on, Tinja, it's time. Good luck. You... Helmi isn't coming? No, Tero and Helmi are staying here. Helmi must come with us. Tinja, we're in a hurry. Helmi must come with us. We're going to be late for the gym. We need to talk. Tinja, say goodbye to Helmi. Goodbye Helmi. Go sit down. Tinja. Matias. Ally, no... You are the last. Give it all. Tinja. It hurts ? No. I don't believe there is a fracture. Let's go. His wrist, okay? - Tero... - Shut up. Tero, what... Do you know what your daughter did? Tinja? When ? There... Now, a while ago. We were at the gym. You drank ? Damn you. What's the matter with you ? We were at the gym, I told you. I don't care, don't set foot here again. What ? You only see yourself, huh? Your daughter has big problems, and I don't want to get involved. Wait for me. Tero. Where are you ? Mom... I was hoping you would let me be happy. Are you going home already? That... It was Tinja who insisted. You lost. It's good to have you home. Go away. I don't want you. I want you to stop doing all this. Tinja. What are you doing here ? Hi everyone. I wanted to keep you informed since my last live ended abruptly. Hi everyone. Tinja is fine... and we would like to thank you all for your messages of support and affection. You have been so kind. You are part of the family. Hi everyone. I always tell you that everything is great, but there are things that are wrong in our lives. Mom. What ? I can... I can do better. I can do it. You stink. Tinja. What are you doing in there? Come, I need you. Your hair is in a terrible state. Have you seen yourself? How can you be so disgusting? Tinja, let me go. Tinja. Let go of me. Go away ! You hear me ? Leave! I do not want you. Nobody wants you! What is that... What was that ? It was I who hatched it. It's all his fault. I just want her to go. Sweetie... You are my beloved little girl. Her mother's darling. Everything is fine ? There is one thing in the house. Don't ask me what. She looks like Tinja but it's not Tinja. It's all his fault. We'll take care of it and everything will be fine. I had not dreamed then. No, my cat. Keep an eye on Matias. Nope ! Mom. We hold it. What will you do ? You wanted to get rid of it, right? Yes, but... I hatched it. Everything will be alright. Nope ! Nope... Tinja? My... man? Adaptation: Didier Ruiller Subtitles: HIVENTY
