Male narrator: No spoilers. Narrators never give away the story. Female narrator: Listen to your father. Female narrator: Lizzie found the well of wonder! Male narrator: The source of all magic and inspiration at Ever After. Brooke Page: Is that the same well Briar threw the Storybook of Legends into? (excited gasp) Are we going to Wonderland? Female narrator: What did we just say? Brooke page: That's not a spoiler, that was a recap. Male narrator: She's right. When Briar found the true Storybook of Legends she threw it down the Well of Wonder so she wouldn't have to sign it. Female narrator: So she could write her own destiny and not follow in her fairy tale parent's footsteps. Male narrator: Little did she know that the book would end up in- Brooke Page: Wonderland! (giggling) Male narrator: Yes, Wonderland. Brooke Page: Oh my Fairy Godmother! I can't believe we are actually here! Female narrator: And the palace of the Queen of Hearts, separated from Ever After by an evil curse. That is Alistair Wonderland, son of Alice from Wonderland. Male narrator: And Bunny Blanc, daughter of the White Rabbit. Queen of Hearts: The baby bird flies, the snake, it slithers, but the cage holds both, to die and to wither! Alistair: What?! Queen of Hearts: This is your last warning. Next time my guards catch you exploring, it's off with your heads! (echoes) Your heads! Your heads! (cart wheels squeak) (claps) Ooh! Afternoon tea! Would that be one lump or two? Female narrator: Now, isn't it time we check in on the school? Male narrator: Oh yes.

Cheshire Cat: You're a Cheshire! Of course you will. Bye! (water splashes as the rock skips) Alistair: The curse on Wonderland has made the Queen of Hearts afraid! Bunny: I know, Alistair. Alistair: Afraid that if anything happens to upset the balance, that green encircling chaos will close in and destroy Wonderland. One day, I'll help solve the riddle and lift the curse. Whoa. What is that? Bunny: I don't believe it... Alistair: It's the Storybook of Legends! Hey, if the book is in our world then that means... there's a portal that isn't sealed anymore! (poof) Brooke Page: Okay, what is that gross green smoke? Female narrator: The curse of the Evil Queen. If she had finished her spell, that evil would have closed in, devastating everything. Male narrator: Which is why the Grimm Brothers, magically severed every path between the worlds. Female narrator: But they forgot one. Male narrator: The Well of Wonder, and this allowed a critical trickle of creativity to flow through the well to Ever After from Wonderland. Brooke Page: Ooh, is this where Lizzie gets the ideas for the dresses? Male narrator: Brooke! What did we say about getting ahead in the story? Brooke Page: Fine! Alistair: Now this is a riddle, and it's begging to be solved. Bunny: You say that about everything. Alistair, Bunny: Ahhhh! (water bubbles) Ahhhhhh! Alistair: Watch out. (waking meow) Bunny: Oh...

Cerise Hood: I don't normally change my look, but this is big bad and bold! Blondie: And take it from this reporter, the "Fairest Five" make this faire just right! (cheering, applause) (meow) Cheshire Cat: Stories you seek that are not your own, lest be found down here all alone. Bunny: Oh! Hey, Kitty's Mom. 'Sup? The real riddle is not what's up... it's what you're doing down here. Alistair: We found the missing Storybook of Legends and are trying to return it to Ever After. Cheshire Cat: Curiouser and curiouser... to get to Ever After follow the Flow of Wonder, two lefts, three rights, four lefts, five rights and so on, until you are there! Good luck! Alistair, Bunny: Wait... what?! (wings flutter) (pages rustle) Cheshire Cat: Mmm... Topsy Turvy. This will give my little Kitty a lesson on how to create some real chaos! (evil laugh) Brooke Page: Is that who I think it is? Male narrator: Yes, the White Knight. In the Wonderland library. Female narrator: More on this later in our tale. Ginger: Hey girls, I was hoping you could help me out. (brain freeze) Aghhhh! Raven: Sure Ginger, what do you need? Ginger: It's the chef showdown this afternoon. Apple: You've nothing to worry about. Everybody knows you're the best cook around. You're going to win. Ginger: (flattered laugh) I don't care about winning, I just want to bring something to the table that has never been tasted before! But I'm missing one ingredient! Wonderland water! Since the worlds have been quarantined, I didn't know how to find any! Madeline: Well, all you have to do is go to the Well of Wonder! Ginger: I knew I came to the right people. Do you know where it is? Madeline: Uh huh, uh huh...uhh, no. But Lizzie Hearts has a map. C'mon! Ginger: So, why do you need a map just to tell you where the Well of Wonder is? (laughing) Heh, what's so funny? Madeline: The well is connected to Wonderland so it's, you know, kinda... Ginger: Oh, mad? Lizzie: We prefer the term "wondrous". Madeline: The well's never in the same place for more than a few minutes. Lizzie: Let's see... (reads map) Oh, there it is! That's where you'll find the Well of Wonder next! Ginger: That is spelltacular! Wow! Madeline: Just told you the Well never stays in one place very long! So go! (tracker beeping) (tracker beeping faster) Ginger: (laughs) It worked! All I need is an ounce... huh? Okay... We've gotta get this book back to our friends in Ever After. Bunny: Let's just hope they have some answers. Alistair: They will. Brooke Page: The Cheshire Cat is stealing the Storybook of Legends. Male narrator: And replacing it with a book of Wonderland riddles. Female narrator: This story is getting good!
