Narrator: They led double lives. Man: I couldn't tell my family or my friends, My kids, my wife, No one could I tell what did I really do. Narrator: Guarding america's secrets In the cold war's darkest hours. Man: It was a black program. The contractors were invisible, Work was invisible. Narrator: A top-secret operation, Now declassified... Man: Our mission was to take photographs Of the soviet union. Narrator: Revealing a cloak-and-dagger world Of robotic satellites and orbiting spy stations. Man: For a rocket engineer, This was the most amazing capability possible. Narrator: Until now, few have known how spies in space Changed the course of the cold war. Man: In many ways, the shadow space race Was far more important than the publicly visible space race. ♪ [explosion] Narrator: 1963. The soviet union and united states Have split the atom and divided the planet. The cold war threatens to turn red hot. Anton fedyashin: The cold war became this competition Between two fundamentally different ideological visions Of how human societies work. The world was looking Both to the united states and to the soviet union For models of how to modernize their own societies. The space race becomes a litmus test Of the two superpowers' abilities To bring humanity into the modern age. Narrator: America, The wealthiest nation on earth, Gets caught up in a space craze. John charles: The space age really infused the culture. Announcer: For the boys of today, The space suit has replaced The cowboy outfit of an earlier year. Charles: Everybody was in a space mood. And it became a way of identifying Who was thinking upward and outward, Who was thinking futuristically. Don't forget, All the automobiles sported rocket-like tailfins, you know, Because that was the future. � ♪ Narrator: But while america dreams of space, When it reaches for the stars, It seems to keep crashing back to earth. The u.S. Space program Can't seem to get out of its own way. f A string of embarrassing failures Sets a sharp contrast to its biggest rival. Fedyashin: During the first decade, It's pretty clear that the soviets Are winning the space race. They beat the americans into space With the first artificial satellite In October of 1957, sputnik. They beat the americans into space With the first living being... The dogs, laika, and then belka and strelka. They beat the americans into space With the first human being, yuri gagarin, In April of 1961. Then the first woman into space in June of 1963. Things really were going the soviet way. Narrator: Soviet successes aren't just pr victories. Armed with the bomb, They cast a shadow of fear across america. James david: And what was critical was If the soviets could launch these satellites, The same rockets could launch nuclear warheads That could be sent from the soviet union To hit the united states. Narrator: Americans are terrified of a surprise attack And fear what's hiding behind the iron curtain. James outzen: The soviet union was a very closed society, And we had no means of really understanding What was happening in this very, very large area. We didn't have the ability to put human spies in To gain information. Narrator: Desperate to learn what the soviets are up to, America dedicates billions of dollars And recruits thousands of the nation's Top scientists and engineers To a single covert mission... High-tech spying from space. Here, once-classified films and animations Show the scale of the military's plan... Sending robotic cameras into space... And, even more ambitious, Putting manned military stations in orbit. ♪ Crucially, the world focuses on another space program... Apollo's moon mission. While nasa's dream team gets all the attention, The military develops a parallel top-secret program. Robert crippen: All of that was highly classified, And we couldn't talk about it. Narrator: In the 1960s, Robert crippen can't discuss any part of what he does. Crippen: Ok, I, uh, I'm afraid I can't go in too much detail on that. Narrator: For these astronauts, It's just name, rank, and serial number. Richard truly: My name's richard truly. Narrator: But today, for the first time, They can tell the whole story. Man: Richard truly, take one. Truly: Now, 50-some odd years later, I can talk about it. But at that time, It was an introduction to a world That I didn't know existed. Narrator: Even the astronaut selection process Is a mystery. Truly: So they had a selection, And they never asked us whether we wanted to or not. They just assumed that we did, which was correct. Crippen: I was wildly happy. Here I was, 28 years old, and, uh, I was gonna get a chance To do something I'd been dreaming about. It was a good time, highlight of my life. Narrator: Crippen and truly are test pilots, But their training to become astronauts Will push them to a new level. [crash] Charles: It was considered The best way to train pilots for space flight Was to subject them to the extremes Of the environment they were likely to see. So there were disorientation trainers, There were vehicles that would tumble the astronauts In all three dimensions all at once, To make them disoriented And to test their ability to reorient themselves And achieve a stable position again, Using systems like in a spacecraft. There were temperature extremes. They would put astronauts in ovens, human ovens, To assess not only their physiological But their psychological resistance To these kind of things. Narrator: After selecting their first class of astronauts, The air force holds just one press conference. Truly: It was on my birthday. I was 28 years old. November 12, 1965. And that was the last time I ever talked to the media in the program. The following morning, They introduced us to the united states' Most classified and secret space programs. Narrator: They are astronauts, american heroes. But unlike the apollo team, They won't become household names. Truly and crippen disappear into one of the most expensive, Secretive, and ambitious space programs Ever conceived... The manned orbiting laboratory, Or mol. David: The manned orbiting laboratory's purpose Was very simple and straightforward, And that was to acquire very high-resolution photography Of targets in the soviet union. Narrator: This film, Recently declassified and never before broadcast, Shows mol under construction. It's the size of a bus. At its heart is a movable 71-inch mirror For a camera that will be as big as a car. It will be by far The largest and most sophisticated Spy platform in space. Truly: Imagine the hubble space telescope, Except pointing down. Charles: Mol was extremely ambitious. 50 years ago, This was the most amazing capability possible... Tracking items in the soviet union With the resolution Of as low as 4 inches on the ground. Something that's the size of a baseball Could be seen from orbit. Narrator: But america isn't looking to play ball. Mol's focus will be on soviet weapons systems, Especially their intercontinental Ballistic missiles. At the start of the space race, Americans fear that the soviets have far more missiles, > And are willing to use them. Fedyashin: Nikita khrushchev had a tendency To make fairly irresponsible threatening statements On a fairly regular basis. But this was all part and parcel Of projecting the image of the soviet union As a very powerful military presence in the world. Joe caddell: So, the threat posed by the soviet union Meant that there was a real fear Of what people will often refer to As a nuclear pearl harbor. ♪ I'm talking in terms of killing Tens of millions of american citizens, Destroying american cities, infrastructure, military forces, Essentially ending the american republic As we know it. [explosion] Narrator: In the atomic age, Total destruction is only minutes away. Mol could help head off a surprise attack, Spotting and then monitoring soviet missile sites. And america has learned the danger Of getting caught off guard. ♪ October 4, 1957. America gets a wake-up call from space. The soviets launch sputnik, The first human-made object to orbit the planet. Suddenly, the soviet menace Feels very real for many americans. Caddell: It didn't take much imagination For people to understand in October of '57 That if the soviets could put sputnik into orbit, They could also deliver a nuclear payload To an american city. Narrator: Sputnik also highlights That the soviets are racing into the future, While america seems stuck in the past. Fedyashin: In early September of 1957, Desegregation is being implemented in arkansas. m And the little rock nine has to be escorted By members of the 101st airborne division Into schools with pro-segregationist whites Holding up signs that read, "race mixing is communism." And then four weeks later, You see the soviet union send sputnik into space. If you are in africa or southeast asia at the time, Whose version of modernization are you more likely to follow? And I think in the '50s and the early '60s, The answer was pretty clear. The soviet union was winning not only the space race, But seemed to be winning the ideological standoff. ♪ Narrator: In the cold war, Both superpowers look to space as the new frontier And, potentially, the next battlefield. Charles: In the '50s and '60s, It's important for america to put people in space As a way of showing The superiority of the american way of life. The next battlefield was in space. It had to be represented by red-blooded americans, Protecting us from the communists, Who were sure to overrun us and subject us to their way of life. Narrator: Initial plans for mol Were straight out of science fiction... An orbiting military outpost, Armed and ready for war. ♪ Charles: Early on, the mol was all things to all people. It had capabilities for reconnaissance, It had capabilities For intercepting of the enemies' satellites in space And negating them. Narrator: But in the final plans, Mol is an orbiting spy station. This rarely seen footage of a mol mock-up Gives a glimpse into just how big it will be. The air force budgets $1.5 billion in 1965, Making it one of the defense department's Most expensive programs. Each mol would be a single-use spacecraft. Charles: The five mol vehicles Were the entire production run. And it's really interesting to imagine That such an expensive, such a complex system Would have been disposable. Narrator: From the start, mol is an ambitious program, With a schedule that's even tighter Than the moon missions. The goal is to start launching in 1969. Charles: The mission in space would have lasted about 30 days. Don't forget, in the 1960s, The entire worldwide experience in space flight Was on the order of 15 or 20 days. So mol was really pushing the envelope To promise 30-day missions repeatedly. Narrator: The first step for the mol astronauts Is to learn the basics of living and working in space. Team chemistry will be essential. Crippen: We were all pilots, we all loved to fly. My fellow mol astronauts were a diverse group. Uh, we certainly weren't all alike. Truly: We were like brothers. Great bunch of people. Narrator: To get a feel for the microgravity of space, Mol crewmen start to take elliptical airplane rides. Truly: If the pilot flying the airplane Is really good, They can maintain zero g, And it's the only way on earth That you can actually create an environment Where you can test in zero g. Narrator: It's a stomach-dropping trip They nickname the vomit comet. Charles: Early concerns about weightlessness, About things such as being able to swallow... It was seriously considered That gravity is necessary for swallowing And, of course, the rest of your digestive processes. Would your body seize up in the absence of gravity? The early concerns about space flight weightlessness Do seem kind of laughable from our perspective now. Narrator: The mol astronauts move on To more challenging tasks. But there are limits to what they can do on zero-g flights. Truly: The problem is it's only 30 seconds. And so to get 10 minutes of flight test Takes 20 of these, And it's exhausting. Narrator: Inside one plane, They build a mock-up of the capsule The astronauts will fly, Called the gemini, And the hatch and tunnel That'll connect the gemini to the spy laboratory. They practice moving around the tight spaces, Turning on cameras and lights only when they reach zero g. Truly: We would get airborne, And these were only 25- or 30-second intervals. And it was show time. Both of us were in the little gemini. And we were in full pressure suits. Turn around, take off the hatch, Crawl through the tunnel, Do all that. Hot, sweaty. We would get stuck. And it was hard work. Narrator: They try loading film in and out of the lab And crawling back into the gemini capsule. They focus on the hatch, Which they'll close at the end of their 30-day mission. Charles: After the astronauts left, The vehicles would have been deorbited To keep them from falling into enemy hands And revealing american secrets to the soviets. Narrator: While the lab burns up on re-entry, The gemini will drop back through the atmosphere, Protected by its heat shield. But mol has a potentially fatal flaw... The specially designed hatch. Crippen: We needed a way To get from the gemini into the laboratory, And they elected to put a hatch through the heat shield, That you would remove And then crawl back through that. Truly: Some of the flight crew Thought, you know, this is crazy. Cut a hole in the heat shield, Because later on when you re-enter, You depend on that heat shield. ♪ Crippen: If the heat shield failed, You would have a 5,000-degree penetration of the atmosphere, And it would cook everybody that was inside, And it would be a major catastrophe. Truly: Well, nobody had done any of this before. Narrator: Mol will be an extremely risky venture, But america is running out of options. May 1, 1960. Newly deployed soviet sa-2 ground-to-air batteries Swing into action. An intruder is arcing over the heart of their nation, Flying out of reach of soviet jets. At 70,000 feet, American pilot francis gary powers Is untouchable in his u-2... Until today. In the days following the u-2's shoot-down, The u.S. Intelligence community Claims that it's just a weather plane Blown off course. But much of the plane, including its powerful camera, Survives the crash, And the cover story falls apart. David: The shoot-down in may 1960 Proved to be a major embarrassment To president dwight eisenhower Because of the attempted cover-up. More importantly, It cut off the only means Of collecting photographic intelligence Of the interior of the soviet union. Fedyashin: And the most important question In the late 1950s Was the so-called perceived missile gap... The idea that the soviets Had more intercontinental ballistic missiles... Icbms as they were known... And that the americans had fewer. Narrator: Without the u-2, America is flying blind. David: Although photographic intelligence Doesn't provide 100% of the answers, It does go a long way in providing the answers To this absolutely critical question... Where do we stand with the soviet union In these long-range nuclear-tipped missiles? Caddell: Premier khrushchev wasn't shy About making statements like "we are churning out missiles like sausages, We will bury you." [men yelling] We had to assume the worst-case scenario. Narrator: The u-2 is no longer an option over the soviet union. And mol isn't even a pipe dream yet. America needs a plan b. Outzen: Eisenhower recognized That the u-2 would eventually be shot down. And in the background, We needed to be developing technology That would allow us to continue to understand What our adversaries were up to The day that that event occurred. David: The united states Started developing reconnaissance satellites In 1956... One to collect photographic intelligence, One to collect signals intelligence... That is, intercepting soviet radars. Narrator: The first photo-imaging satellite Is called corona. But on January 29, 1959, It can't even lift off the pad. One misfire is followed by 12 more attempts... And 12 failures. But they can't give up. David: This was a completely new technology. No one had ever done it before. But the system was so important to the united states For its potential in gathering intelligence, They did not cancel the program. Caddell: If corona doesn't succeed, The americans continue to have to craft Foreign policy and defense spending In terms of a giant question mark Regarding the soviet threat. Narrator: Even if the military Can get corona's cameras into space, Many think there's a better option... Human spies. Charles: So to have a flexible system in space, You needed to have people on board. And if you had the people on board, You need to understand What the capabilities of those people were And how to keep those people healthy and functional During the time they're in space. Narrator: In 1966, the mol team builds an underwater mock-up Off buck island in the caribbean To simulate life in space. This footage gives a rare behind-the-scenes look At the operation. Engineers and astronauts Put on their diving masks and respirators And then layer on their space suits, Filled with water. Neutrally buoyant, They can practice for as long as their air holds out. Charles: Planning for the mol Included underwater training, And more than training, Evaluation of procedures. Narrator: Unlike the 30-second zero-g flights, They can spend hours each day underwater, Practicing maneuvers And passing canisters of film through the tunnel. The mol program is progressing, But slowly and over budget. Crippen: The launch kept moving down the road. It seemed like every year it was a year away. Some technical difficulties, But it was primarily a funding issue. Man: Five seconds... Mark... Narrator: In contrast, the simpler, cheaper corona Has been on the fast track for several years. On August 10, 1960, With lucky number 13, Corona leaves the pad And reaches orbit. David: About 24 hours later, They commanded the satellite to eject the capsule. They recovered the capsule, And it was brought back to the white house, And president eisenhower and some key advisors Actually had a press conference. Man: I am proud, mr. President, To present you this flag of the united states of america. Narrator: The capsule and flag Are the very first man-made objects To fly into space and return safely.
