Excuse me Watch out Don't come too close Um, I came again to talk about the Wabi fireworks I'm Shoko's niece She was my mother's sister People say I look like her And, um, I hear d that you went out with her and about... ...the accident I watched the fireworks with my aunt many times She always looked forward to your fireworks Even in the hospital. Before she died she waited for your Wabi She stared out the window I'll never forget how she looked, as if she was praying while she waited Takimoto! Takimoto! You gave up fireworks but my aunt wrote music for you until the end! Don't you know how she felt while she was waiting for your fireworks? This is the plan for the show Wait, what are you doing? I told you already I quit fireworks I'm finished with fireworks Finished What a loser Wow, so beautiful! So pretty Wow, amazing Incredible Aren't they, Shoko? The show's over Can you go home, Kana? I'll be OK OK, goodnight Bye Why didn't you launch them? Hello Came to deliver your order Thanks You haven't been back since then You having a picnic? Fun, isn't it? Yeah Have a seat Here you go Wow Shall we? Bon appetite Delicious Celery with miso? Not so common Really good My boyfriend always ate like this What did he do? Made fireworks So the shop accident... He. Um... quit, taking responsibility for my ear injury I told him it was his fault I couldn't play the piano But, I never did want him to quit fireworks I honestly wanted him to keep creating fireworks But that didn't r each him Once a year I watched his fireworks and wrote a song I wanted to compose 10 parts but there was no 10th show This... Oh, that... The 10th par t That's the only phrase that came to mind A song called 'Eternity' Shoko, would it be OK for me to play it? He made Wabi, Japanese-style fireworks Wabi? Yes They seemed to bloom forever in the sky So beautifully Wabi Play a bit more brightly And make the third chord match the melody a bit more The third... Yes That's it. That's it Sounds good Keep going 'Eternity' Should have let Shoko and Takimoto get married They were going to? They promised each other But as a parent... I couldn't forgive the man who took her talent I wonder, he must've realized our feelings He stopped coming after she entered the hospital It's not your fault But... If they had been together, Shoko would've been happier when she died Anybody home? Takimoto Takimoto! Takimoto Takimoto Takimoto! Sorry to barge in It's me, Shoko What the hell are you saying? I want to see you launching fireworks I've had enough of you! You should know better! Running again? Like you did from Shoko? Running? I know about the accident and my aunt's hearing loss But running don't help, you know Shouldn't have quit if you felt responsible What do you know? Shoko... Shoko's dead That's why I'm - fireworks won't help! You can't pay her back? All you can do is live like this for 12 years after quitting? Who are you to say this? Don't be so miserable! If my aunt were still alive, she'd be sad to see you like this! Shoko would be crushed! Listen to me very carefully She's the one who told me to quit to take responsibility She's the one who said no to marriage If I could only meet Shoko one more time I'm sorry This... is something my aunt wrote before she died She was always inspired to write music during the show She was holding this in the hospital at the time I think my aunt is still waiting for your fireworks I'm leaving I'm waiting for your fireworks Can I help you? A reading? "The Crying Red Ogre" Let's go over there Have a seat There was a house somewhere hidden, on the cliff of a mountain. Who lived there?
