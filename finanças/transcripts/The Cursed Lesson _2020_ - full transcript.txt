We're here. Is anyone in there? Why is it so quiet? Is this the right place that was reported? They surely heard a scream. - Who? - From downstairs. Yeah? Wait, Miss! Put that knife down. I don't know what's going on, but put it down first. We can help you, okay? I know you're all in it together. You thought I wouldn't know. Die! Kundalini… Look towards the left. Good. Don't you think this model looks too old? Well, she looks fine to me. No! Even her skin looks too dull. Our main target is 20-something, but this seems for 40s or 50s. What about changing her dress? Changing out her outfit won't change anything. Hyo-jeong, what's with that look on your face? - Smile for me. - I'm sorry. This model doesn't look fresh at all. You shouldn't do this now. Well, she's not a rookie model or something and now... I'd rather use a rookie. Would you take responsibility if our market share drops? Give us a moment, please. - Okay. - Okay. What a nut. What does he even know about a commercial? Hyo-jeong, I'm really sorry, but… This client keeps complaining about using you. You know how it works around here. I'll call you again with another job, okay? Hello? Where are you now? Are you available now? I was not there at that time! Chief is calling you. Not again! Why? I'm goddamn busy now. I have no idea. Goddamnit. Am I his punching bag or what? I want you to take that case. It's a homicide where she killed an old couple next door and attempted suicide. It's your expertise, isn't it? Come on, what expertise? They might think I'm Lieutenant Horatio from CSI or something. Dammit. Hey. You've got nothing to do at home these days, huh? It must be nerve-wracking to be alone after divorce. Take a close look at it. Go solve it. First, as she's unconscious now, try investigating the people around her. When she comes around, the hospital will call you. Good, this is the right image we've been looking for. Chic and urban. We wouldn't have wasted time if it was her from the beginning. You have such an excellent eye for it. Yeah, it's the exact image that our company wanted. I knew you'd like her. Well then, let's get ready to shoot. Didn't you say you had an ad shooting? You have time for things like this? Well… The client wanted to work with me, but I didn't like their products, so I turned it down. You shouldn't have! At our age, we should just work without thinking twice. Isn't it scary to see young girls catching up to us? You look a little tired. Did you go on another harsh diet for the shooting? Geez. Do I look like that? It's not the shooting. I can't sleep well these days because of paralyzing nightmares. I saw a doctor but there's no change. What? Nightmares? I used to often have them when I was young. Grandma told me to put a knife under my pillow and I did so, and I've never had them ever since. Isn't it amazing? You should try. It doesn't hurt to try. It's from my experience. What are you staring at? What? No, it's nothing. Bend your legs to the right. Then, inhale deeply with your hands to the ceiling, exhale and right hand on the floor. Stretch your left hand. And inhale, exhale with your left hand under the right armpit. Roll up your spine. Two, one. Excuse me. Yes? We met a few days ago, didn't we? I don't know. Are you sure? Yes. You're Lee Hyo-jeong from Dong-soong Girl's High School, right? By the way, you've changed a lot. Oh, I hear that from time to time. I should accompany you to your beauty treatment. Treatment? Yeah, whatever it is, plastic surgery or skin care. So you also think I've gotten a huge makeover from plastic surgery? What's wrong with that? Everyone's doing it. What is it? Yoga studio? It's not the kind of yoga studio that you're thinking of. The classes are really tough, and it costs an arm and a leg. But once the course is over, you'll feel a definite change. You're trying to fool someone you haven't seen in ages? What? Yoga? If you don't wanna tell me, then just say it. You looked quite desperate that day. Come on, give it another thought. And I don't tell lies, unlike you-know-who. I think I need to have that treatment again. I told you that you can't. Just let me have it, please. Gosh, I said no. There's a huge side effect. And a risk of skin damage, too. Then, is there anything I can have right now? Brightening. I need a brightening treatment. Let me at least get that. For now, there's no procedure that can be done on your face. Just get a skin massage for today. It's complimentary. What happened? Someone's dead again, I think. People swimming here die due to the deep waters and some people even kill themselves here. The last guest is on her way now. Welcome. We were expecting you. You're all here. Thank you for coming a long way. I'm Yu-jin, who will lead you to the world of Kundalini from today. AGREEMENT You'll see some rules to follow in here. Drinking and smoking are strictly prohibited. And drugs, of course. Not even coffee? No. You are allowed to eat and drink that we serve here. Cell phones aren't allowed either, as they hugely affect our training. Then how do we make contact with the outside? Only during designated times until the training's over. That's too intense. If you don't like our rules, you're free to leave now. Then we'll begin training at five. I'll see you then. This place doesn't look like a woman lived alone. - She worked at a hostess bar? - Yes. I asked her neighbors and she had no interaction with the dead couple. Nothing significant. He seems to be her boyfriend. This is nonsense. How can we not lose weight when we eat like a bird? It's just a plain program that starves you and makes you slim. Isn't it? - Right. - I'm Kang Mi-yeon. Oh, I'm Lee Hyo-jeong. Hi, I'm Kim Ji-won. How did you all find out about this place? I'm an MMA fighter, and I came here to lose weight. We fighters also gotta be pretty these days. Wow, that's cool. A female martial arts fighter. You look too young to be here. - What's your reason? - Well, I just… Are you here for retreat or something? We all came here to get prettier, isn't it? So just give those ice-breaking lines a rest. Aren't you Jeong Ye-na the actress? I'm a big fan of yours. By the way, do you think we can all get prettier? I just wanted to take a chance, but I'm not sure. Her talk about some Kundalini kind of sounded like a scam. In fact, I thought my friend was dragging me into a pyramid scheme. But she came to see me looking pretty and slim, so I was surprised. Even plastic surgery wouldn't do any good for her face. We're always going to have this tea before class. Drink. It'll ease your mind. Now, we'll begin our training. Only for Kundalini. Excuse me. You keep saying "Kundalini," but what is that? All humans possess the energy of the universe. They're simply unaware of it. In here, as if in a mother's womb, you'll open the third eye. And witness its power that completes your beauty. I will make it possible. Excuse me. Is it scientifically possible? The soul and the universe, and their communion… It's a power that science can never reach. Don't doubt it. Get rid of even the slightest doubt. If not, you'll never reach the level of Kundalini. Never. Close your eyes and let's start with breathing. Excuse me. Yes, go ahead. I think I heard some strange noise in my sleep at night. I think you heard that wrong. So I opened my door just to be sure, and saw something that looked like a snake. Well, again, I think you saw that wrong, but we'll go check anyway. Do you have anything else to say? No. Hello, sweety. Come on. So when do I get my car? You're sure this time? Where? Oh, that motel we went last week? Yeah, that place was fine. Damn, this bitch tries to suck me up with that BMW. - Mr. Min Cheol-su? - Yes? Do you know this woman? Oh, she's Bora. Did she cause trouble? Are you two together? Not really, it's just a business relationship. Anyway, she's a total nutcase, seriously bipolar and so. We know that she is, too. Just tell me more about her. She used to be such a popular bar girl at the hostess bar. She said she once made tens of thousands of won… - Get to the point. - Okay. But she was getting old and then the younger girls rolled in, so she got severely depressed. Then one day, she went somewhere for some yoga. And, oh my gosh, came back with her whole body transformed. She lost so much weight and her wrinkles were gone. She came back looking pretty? Yeah. But the problem was that she started seeing ghosts. Talking about snakes and chakra and all that. I got scared and stopped talking to her. Sir, they said Jeong Bo-ra just came around. Next position. Next position. Now bend over. Slowly. Excuse me. I can't focus. We gotta be at similar levels. Our gap is way too big, isn't it? Move on to the next position. Your body's too stiff. Relax. Come to the training room at midnight, alone. Move on to the next position. So, you mean you killed them because of yoga? I did see it. Saw what? I've almost reached Kundalini, but they were seeking my soul. I mean, what could they possibly seek? Those oldies were incapacitated. Are you saying that old man sexually harassed you or what? The realm of Kundalini is far from the secular world you are thinking of. Well, we have no choice. As there's no further statement, let's just wrap up our report here. I saw it! I saw it for sure. There are many snakes. Are they gross? What? Well, a little. Snakes once symbolized wisdom and medicine, but prejudice grew over time. And lots of distortion. I see. It's tough, isn't it? I just feel bad for being a burden to others. Here, try this tea. It's called karma, and it'll help you relax. Both physically and mentally. It'll even help you open your eyes. How do you like it? It's a bit bitter, but… It's making me relaxed, I guess. At first, I also thought I was seeing things from extreme dieting. Okay. What the heck. Let me just hear your story in detail. What did you see? A ghost. A ghost. I know you don't buy it, but I really saw it. It kept following me and whispering in my ears. That whispering was seriously killing me. The whispering never stopped. And those creepy sounds… You'd never know the fear and the pain. I got courageous during my meditation. Let's not run away anymore, Kundalini is around the corner. This ghost haunting you turned out to be your neighbors. So you went there right away and killed them with a knife. During a meditation. Where an earth can I learn that Kundalini thing? Let me just learn it, too. Next position. Next position. What? Stay focused! Next position. Look straight ahead, and breathe. You seem to have gotten much better in a day. What happened? I'm not sure if you'd buy it. I was meditating by myself in the training room last night. Then suddenly, I got aroused. And it got maximized. And it kind of made me feel like overcoming my limit, which I've never felt before. Are you sure you weren't already good, and you've been hiding it until now? Level with me. This Kundalini comes from the purest mind. That's what the master said. I guess you'll never be able to feel it. "Master"? What master are you talking about? What are you doing here? I… This area is restricted to outsiders. Leave. What are you doing here at this hour? - Oh... - You can't be out like this after bedtime. I'm sorry. What is it? Get out! It's okay. You can just enjoy it. Focus on all of your inner energy. You might feel the heat coming from the bottom. Feel the heat, focusing on the bell sound. Slowly. Good. This is it for today. Well done. Ji-won, just a moment. It's quite serious. You should see a doctor right away. Why should I see a doctor? Do you want me out of this place? You're afraid I'd get prettier than you, aren't you? - No, I'm really worried. - Mind your own business. You morons have no idea what Kundalini is. What's wrong with her? Isn't she nuts? - Are you okay? - It was really out of concern. What's the world coming to? This senior colleague has to get coffee for his junior. Then you can do all the research here. Hey. Are you patronizing me for being a computer illiterate? Nah, how dare could I do that. - Look at you. - Sir. The more I learn about Kundalini, the weirder it gets. What's weird? Listen, a snake that passes Chakra five near Adam's apple will become a dragon, and if it passes Chakra six between forehead, it gets a dragon ball, and when it passes Chakra seven, a trainee finally reaches the level of Saint. - What's that mean? - Huh? It means, Kundalini is the latent energy in human body, which can be maximized through yoga and meditation. Why does it have to be a snake? That must be some sort of a symbolic meaning. Sir, I feel like this case has something to do with a cult. I was thinking that, too. Starting tomorrow, go find out if there's anyone related to it, focusing on people around the suspect. Okay. What a creep. He sure knows who's pretty. I think I need to get out of here. What's going on? My dead friend… shows up every night. Would you believe it if it's a natural phenomenon? What do you mean, a natural phenomenon? It means your spiritual eye to reach Kundalini is opening. Then what? You'd see another world, wouldn't you? Well, you can leave anytime. It's not like this place is a prison. But… It's a big shame. Such a spiritual event could have made you reach it for sure. It's ready. Okay. I'm sorry I'm late. Let's begin. Push your hip forward and lean backward. Now, the arrow position. As if your toes and head meet, stretch as much as possible. Such a weakling. Now what? - Ma'am. - Yeah, Ji-won. I'm here. Why? What is it? I'm so cold. You're cold? Freezing cold? Hang in there. If you do, you'll get really pretty. Did you see Hyo-jeong's skin? Did she get some hydro injection from somewhere or what? Her face was glowing. How can you say that now when somebody's hurt? That's just that. I'm sure she did something. Didn't you know? Actually, she's getting some private treatment. Skin repair for VVIPs. She was late today because of that, she said. You really didn't know? Don't you think we should go check on Ji-won? Why were you late today? Well… I had some issues. Didn't the director give you some special treatment? Pardon? I mean, look. If you spend time with her, a newb becomes a yoga master, or your skin turns super fair in just one day. Gosh, were you surprised? I haven't told you anything so far since this was too personal. Ji-won is suffering from dystonia on her muscle. We've just found a painkiller with drug substance from her bag. Then, how is Ji-won's condition now? It's not really a cause for concern. But let's wrap up today's lesson for now. In 1962, it was designated as National Monument No. 98, and its name Sagul means a snake cave. They used to sacrifice virgins to the giant snake in Gimnyeong-Sagul Cave. A yoga studio next to the snake cave. I think her condition's getting worse. And she seems to be losing her mind. Should I give her a stronger drug, huh? I've put her apart from the other trainees, but I don't think she'll last long. Let her live a few days with a strong one. She must naturally die somewhere else. There are seas everywhere. I said, it won't take long. She's meditating now. I'll tell her later on. I'm Jeong Ye-na. - I wanna see her... - Please calm down first. Hey, how dare you put your hand on me! What's going on? I wanna talk to you but he says I can't. Don't you know she's our VVIP? - I apologize. - Leave us. Yes. What brings you here? It's about Hyo-jeong. I saw you two yesterday. Suddenly, her skin got so much fairer. You know what I'm talking about. Of course, I do. You're our precious guest. We've already prepared it for you. Come to the training room at midnight. A special treatment will be waiting for you. There's such a thing? But it has to be our own little secret. Ye-na! Ye-na! Are you okay? Ye-na! - I'll bring some help. - No! You don't need to wake them up. I don't wanna make a fuss. I just fell asleep while meditating. But, still… I'll be fine if I drink water and get some rest. Please, don't tell anyone what you saw today. When Joseon Dynasty was under Jeongjong, a new judge named Seo-ryun was known to have killed a huge snake at Gimnyeong-Sagul Cave. Then, a shaman told him not to look back and run into the castle, but suddenly, blood rain began to pour. So he carelessly looked back… And turned into a salt pillar? That one is from the Bible. Anyway, that snake's blood soared up high and fell everywhere. So, what happened to that judge? He died. THE MONUMENT TO THE MARTYR XU GONG I've got something to say. I've been thinking, but on that day… Sorry to bother you, but I need your approval for this. On that day, what? No, nothing. I was just too sensitive. I'm sorry. Something's not right here. I'm sure this place's cursed. What do you mean by that? Ever since that day, I see a snake. A snake? A big snake. I know it's unbelievable. But I'm not lying. We gotta get out of here. Maybe Ji-won hasn't been around because she's dead. Ye-na, calm down first. I saw it! I did see it! You trust me, don't you? You have to trust me. I'm not lying. I don't tell lies. I don't tell lies, unlike you-know-who. You thief! It's mine. I bought it with my own money. Choi Ga-yeong, you filthy bitch. My dad bought me this for my birthday from a luxury store. Don't you try to bullshit me, you little thief. It's true. Believe me, please? Stop it, bitch. You wanna die? Give it back. And I don't tell lies. This goddamn bitch is pissing me off. No! Bullshit, you nuts. It's all because of you. Who is it? Mi-yeon, I'm Ji-won. Ji-won, are you okay? Come on in. What's wrong? Gosh, you're burning up. Let's go see a doctor now. No! Let's just stay here. I'm scared. That snake will come again. Snake? There's no snake in here. You should lie down first. I'm so cold. Okay, hold on. No, I don't wanna do this yoga anymore. What took you so long? We were waiting. Where are the others? Their bodies have already reached Kundalini. Hyo-jeong, now you can get everything that you want. What was it that I really wanted? The ultimate beauty. That's what you wanted. Why would I have wanted that? You don't need to worry at all. Kundalini will give you answers to all your questions, and true beauty. I know you killed her, Ga-yeong. How are you today? Detective. Did you capture the yoga trainer that I told you about? Well, I'd rather say we found her than captured. And Secretary Choi who was killed with a knife on your bed. And that female staff who was stabbed to death in the kitchen. How many times have I told you I didn't kill them? This is all that woman and Ga-yeong's doing. You said she was Choi Ga-yeong, right? Right. Once you capture her, the truth will come out. According to our investigation, her name is Park Seo-hui, aged 27. Nothing but her job, a model, matches your description. I said no. This one is Ga-yeong, from Dong-soong Girl's High School! Isn't this woman Choi Ga-yeong from Dong-soong High School? No. I've never seen her before. She's the real Choi Ga-yeong. No way! She's not Choi Ga-yeong! This real Ga-yeong has never met you after graduation. Model Park Seo-hui said she saw you at the photo studio. She took your commercial. It was her who told me about that yoga studio. That's Jeong Bo-ra from your high school! She's in the same situation as you. There was a record of her meeting you, right before her arrest for murdering neighbors. She said she told you about that yoga studio at that time. It can't be. It's your skin clinic treatment record, right? You've been getting the illegal procedures with amphetamine. And sleeping pills, consistently. The expert said if these two substances mix up, it's highly likely to see or hear things. Your brain, all messed up with drug, has turned this Model Seo-hui into a virtual girl Ga-yeong. Then what about Kali, that yoga studio? Kali began to get famous for making girls pretty and slimmer, and people like you paid an arm and a leg for their lessons. You've lost weight so fast, but that was because you've been constantly having tea containing drug substances. So, the trainees got to see and hear things. And they've been covering it up, calling it Kundalini. They brewed tea from monkshood flower root to prevent such side effects. There's a saying that the root eases brain diseases, but its poison is so deadly that it was used during the Joseon Dynasty as poison for killing in the court. Kim Ji-won has been killed by that very poison. So you mean, my own hallucination… has created delusions? You know there was a male staff, Secretary Choi. This man you killed was the yoga trainer's lover, and the other one was her husband. The husband arrested there confessed it all. Do you expect me to believe all of this? Can you believe it if it was you? It can't be true. There was someone trying to kill me. It's true, it was self-defense. There really was someone. That someone was trying to kill me. How is she? She can't remember what she did at all. I don't think she's acting. Miss Lee Hyo-jeong! Calm down! Calm down! Nurse! - What's happening? - She suddenly had a convulsion. My wrist hurts! - It's urgent. - Please take it off! My wrist hurts so much, please. My wrist hurts so much. What's going on? Give me some gauze. How's the office these days? Well, it's all the same. Chief's worried sick about you. How can he not even call me once if he's so worried about me? It's because we're all busy looking for that last trainee of the yoga studio, okay? By the way, when does your suspension end? Don't ask, you bastard. I still gotta wait so damn long. Anyway, where do you think the last trainee might be? How would I even know? I'm not a psychic. What? You can just enjoy it, too. Kundallini.
