Pretty good. That's good. Try it again. Whap! Make sure your fingers are in the right.. That's not bad. Okay. Ready? Go! - You got it. - Oh, oh, oh, oh, over here. Oh, oh, I got it! Come here. Joe, napkin's in that box behind you. So did you have fun at practice? Yeah, it was okay. There's no law that says you have to play football. He'll be fine. He's just gotta show 'em what he's worth, that's all. Hon, where's the carving knife? Is it.. Uh, it's just on the counter there. I'll just go and grab it. Oh, guess what. We're using the same math textbook that I had in Lewiston last year. Already done it all. Well, they should put you in a more advanced class then. Do you want me to call them? Oh, no harm in letting the boy get ahead. This way, he'll be the front of his class. He could be the front of his class, anyway. You'll tell the teacher if it gets too easy. Right, Joe? Yeah. Okay. Do we need a comma here? - Yeah. Here. I've got it. - Okay. That's a full count. Jerry? - Yeah? - Can you help me? Rusty needs to be careful. He winds the pitch. That's in there. Strike three. No! 1960 has been a heck of a year. Now fire can be a positive force. Clears the undergrowth and helps the forest regenerate. You'll make a home out of that timber someday. But these fires are burnin' out of control. The fire started about 60 miles west of us. That wind is carryin' the smoke over the plains and dumpin' it right here in our valley. And that's a real danger. Scar your lungs without you knowin' it. You know, nine out of ten fires are preventable.. You don't have to take notes. Sorry? It's the same as the bomb drills. If the fire ever gets to us, it will be too late. Now does anyone have any questions? My old partners can't believe the luck we've been having up here. Luck's not luck when you plan for it. Signs all pointed north those boys were scared to take a risk and didn't move fast enough. In a moment. - Leg's acting up. - Alright. Gentlemen. Hope Jerry's treating you well. Oh, he's a good one. I went ahead and booked a lesson for tomorrow after he damn near fleeced the pants off of me. Oh, no, no, you gentlemen were just buttering me up for next time. You're not supposed to wager with our guests, Jerry. Well, don't worry about it. It was all in fun. Well, gentlemen, you can follow me if you'd like another beer on the house. I'll take one, Clarence. Oh! Thanks, Jerry. See you tomorrow, Mr. Cartwright. I thought my husband had already paid for everything. - It seems the check bounced. - Oh. I... I'm so sorry. We, um, we had to switch banks when we moved. That must be the problem. Must be nice being around young people all day. All that spirit. I guess. It can tire a person out. Oh, I know. I worked as a substitute. The last place we lived, the teacher had a baby and I ended up staying all year. I believe we've made our hires for the fall. No, I wasn't.. No, my... my... my husband and I decided I should be home with our son now. Brinson, ball! Come on. You grab that. Bring it in! Alright, the offense is getting through. You gotta stop that. You can't have that in the game. At school, they told us to be careful outside because of all the smoke. Do you see any smoke? They are making people afraid for no reason. How's football going? You're gonna be the next Bob Waterfield? I don't know. Oh, that's alright. I'm not gonna be the next Walter Hagen either. Oh, I bet you could be. Nah, he could miss a shot and still win the hole. The game came naturally to him. But wasn't it the same for you? I thought it was that easy. There's probably something wrong in that. Dad, I... I'm not... I'm not really sure that I like football. Are you making friends on the team? They already know each other. I know. Ask 'em personal questions. Works like a charm. People love to talk about themselves. Jerry, you got everything done? Clarence, this is my son, Joe Brinson. Joe, this is Clarence Snow, president of the club and the best golfer out there. Jerry, I'd like a word with you. - That's fine. - Give us a minute, son. Oh, could it wait till tomorrow? I have to get him back home for dinner. This won't take long. - Okay, finish up, son. - Yeah. Count that, would you, son? Are we rich yet? It's a little over $80. Two weeks' pay. What's a man entitled to? What do you think? Did he say why he fired you? He says I overstepped my boundaries with the customers. I'm just personal, you know. That's what people like about me. It's an important part of the job. - No, I know. - No, I'm too well liked. That's my problem. They just, they just don't want small people like us to get ahead. Oh, Jesus. What am I gonna tell your mother? Did he even give a good reason? Doesn't have to have a reason. You must have done something he didn't like. Well.. That man is a damn fool. How is he ever gonna find a better man for that job? - You're not angry? - No. Not at you, anyway. I'll... I'll find something better. You're right. This is an opportunity in disguise.. The phone will be ringing off the hook once people hear you're free. p Hey! H... Hey! Enough of that. Why don't you see if there's a game on the radio? You won't have to worry about anything, Joe. Yeah. No, I'm, I'm not worried. Hey, I... I missed the bus. Can you drive me? Uh, your father has the car. You'll have to take your bike. - Did he get an interview? - I don't know, sweetheart. Joel! - Yeah? - Can you.. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Hello? Uh, no, he isn't in right now. Concerning what? Dad? Dad? Hey, kiddo. Shouldn't you be in school? Yeah, uh, Mom sent me to find you. A man from the Wheatland Club called. What do they want? They said they made a big mistake. They want you to come back. - They do? - Yeah. You have to call right away. They said there's a job available tomorrow. I have nothing to say to those people. What do you mean? I won't work for people like that. - But, Dad. - Joe, I'll.. You tell your mother that I won't work for people like that. If they call again, I'm not interested. Go on. Okay. Did you mail the rent? I will. Tomorrow. You see, they're hiring at the Valu-Mart. I didn't, I didn't come to Montana to bag groceries. No, it'd just be to tide us over. I am not doing a teenager's job. Maybe I should go back to work then. - I'm making contacts, Jean. - Just a part-time job. Till you get established. It would be a good way to meet people. It's about time I made some friends around here. Jerry? Sure. If that's what you want. Okay. Mom? Well, would you hire me? Yeah, you look nice. Thank you. Mom, is Dad, is Dad okay? Of course, he is. Then wh... why wouldn't he take his job back? I don't know. Maybe his pride got hurt. That happens sometimes. Right, but he's still looking for work though. He's interviewing, isn't he? He says he is. Will we have to move again? He's been out of work before and he always finds his way. We have to trust him. That's all. Come on. Zip me up. Joe. Get out of my bathroom. How come you don't always take the bus? I like to ride my bike. You're not gonna be able to do that much longer. - The weather's about to turn. - Yeah. I'm... I'm not looking forward to that. [ Am. First sign of snow, my dad gets to come home from the fire. Oh, is your father at the fire? He's gone almost every time it's happened and he still has eyebrows and hair on his head too. Don't think I've ever met a real firefighter. He's not a firefighter. He works in construction. But times like these, they use all the men they can get. Have you been watching on the news? No. Our TV's been on the fritz. I have been a substitute teacher. I've also been an accountant of sorts um, so I'm, I'm good with numbers. And I'm also very good with children, so... We have no positions. Could I speak to your manager then? His answer's the'same as mine. We're not hiring. I can answer phones. I can type... You knew, you should try the pharmacy. I rear they ' re-looking for a girl. I asked over there. Um, your ad in the paper says... There is no secretarial position. The newspaper ran an old notice. God knows why. It's giving me a real headache today sorting that out. I'm sorry. That must be frustrating for you. Yes, it is. Do you have anything for a man? My husband's looking for work as well. Shucks. You don't happen to know how to swim, do you? There are two mixed age groups and one junior class and they'll let me teach privately too. Can you believe the luck? Imagine, people in Montana wanna learn to swim. - Why do you think that is? - I don't know. Maybe we're all about to get washed away in a, big flood. No. Some of us will get washed away but some of us will float to the top. - It's better, isn't it? - Much better. A happy ending for the right people. People who signed up for swimming at the Y. Maybe I should get a job too. That is a fine idea. We can all pitch in. No, you... you have school and football. That's enough. He'll learn more at a job than he will playing football. He, he won't learn anything bagging groceries. Why don't we let Joe decide for himself? - Don't threaten me, Jean. - Oh, grow up. Jerry, you have your feelings hurt is all. You have to face facts. - Is everything okay? - Oh, kiddo. Just turning the radio. Three parts divisions. I learn the number of men already out on the line what equipment's up front and that more is on the way. The campaign fire is just like war and war, as we all know, is grim. Yes, our objective goes pretty much without saying. Put the fire out as quick as we can. - Fingers together. Fingers together. Okay. New push the water. That's gr-eat. So let's try it in the peel. -. Everybody, down. - Name? - Joe Brinson. - Age? - 14. - Any work experience? - No, sir. So have you ever handled this kind of equipment before? No, sir. But my mother says I'm a quick study. Hm, alright. Come with me then. Watch your head,. See, one of the first things you wanna do is to check to see if the bulb is still hot. So just use the back of your hand. Go ahead. Now don't touch it, but, yeah, that's good. Now you wanna ask the customer to take a seat. So go ahead. And if it's a group, you might have them stand up and, uh, you know, tall people in the back short people in the front. I And then.. You know, warn the customer you're going to turn on a bright light. And-always remember to smile. And always remember to smile. And always reriermber to smile. That is great. Now swim towards me. You're doing fantastic. I wanna see both of your legs kicking. We are a powerful country but I believe we can be a more powerful country. Now in 1960, in these dangerous and difficult and challenging times I believe we can get this country moving again. You see people like to come in here to remember something good that's happening in their lives. They wanna make that happy moment permanent. That way, they can keep it forever. And we're here to help 'em do that. - Do you understand? - Yes, sir. Good. Alright. Let me show you how to work the register. Goodnight. Civics test was hard. All those dates. Yeah, I know. I'm, I'm behind. I heard you quit football. Uh, yeah, yeah. I had to get a job. You're working after school then? Not today. - Ruth, where are we going? - You'll see. Sorry, I'm late. Mom? Talk to your father. Tell him not to act like a fool. I am not being foolish. I put my name on a list, I waited for my chance and now they finally have a place for me. You don't know anything about fires. You'll get burned up. Well, I've been reading about them. I know enough. You've been reading about them? You've been studying up? Don't turn my words on me, Jean! Dad, what's going on? Your father is leaving us to go and fight those wildfires. What? Dad, why? Ask him, Joe. He won't take a job at a grocery store but he'll go out with a bunch of deadbeats and risk getting killed. - You don't have to go there... - What does it pay? - What? - What does it pay? - A dollar an hour. - Oh, my God. Jerry, listen, you don't have to do this. I'm working... I know, but it won't be for long. What if, what if you get yourself killed? It's gonna snow. The fire's gonna go out... What if it doesn't? What if it never snows at all? - Joe, what do you think... - Oh, my God. Don't ask him... He's almost grown. He has a say in what happens... your father gets burned up and you never see him again? - You guys go straight... - Don't say that, Jean! You can't keep running every time something doesn't go your way! You don't know what I'm doing. Don't I? I'm a grown woman, Jerry. Why don't you act like a grown man? I wish I had some money to give you. I feel like I should. What are you gonna be doing out there? Digging trenches the fire won't cross. Doing whatever they need men for. How long are you gonna be gone? I got this hum inside my head. I... I need to do something about it. You understand? You tell your mother that I didn't mean to make her mad. You're too old to give your dad a kiss, hmm? You know, men love each other too. - You know that, don't you? - Yeah. He left. He said that he didn't mean to make you mad. He has very beautiful intentions. Maybe he's gonna leave me. I don't think he's gonna do that. We haven't been intimate lately. You're old enough now to hear that. Don't answer that. I told him we shouldn't have come here. What kind of a man leaves his wife and child in such a lonely place? You probably think I'm making too big a deal out of this, don't you? I don't know what you're thinking. Tomorrow something will happen to make things feel different. You think so? Goodnight, Mom. You'll have to take the bus today. I'm gonna look for a better job. «- I thought you liked the Y. I did. - How do you feel? Strange? «-4 wouldn't be surprised with your father taking off like that. - Uh, no, I feel fine. - Good. No use feeling sorry for ourselves. We might have to move to a smaller place. Would you mind that? Well, have... have you talked with Dad about it? This fire could go on for a long time. I have to be smart about things. Uh, Dad said he'll be home soon. As... as soon as it snows. You're wasting your life standing there watching me, sweetheart. Go to school. Well, will you be here when I get home? I'm not going off to fight any fires if that's what you're asking. Take one and pass it down. You all have 15 minutes to complete the quiz on last night's homework. Sir, I didn't get a chance to complete the homework. Why not? Um, I. Joe, you're still gonna have to take the quiz. Just do better next time. Okay. Mickey Mantle or Bobby Richardson? Uh, Mickey Mantle.. There's no way they're gonna win. Where does your family come from? Several places... - Who do you have for English? - Miss Todd. Yeah, I had her last year. Everybody thinks she's tough but as long as you do the reading, she likes you. It's a neat car. It's not ours. It's too bad. I don't think I have that power. As a matter of fact, I think I went to high school with a gentleman who, uh is in control of the boiler of that building. Well, you have powerful friends in powerful places. Maybe for our next class, you'll find... Well, that would be fantastic. Joe, didn't you have work? - No, not on Tuesdays. - Oh, right. Where are my manners? Mr. Miller, this is my son, Joe Brinson. It's good to meet you, Joe. I recently taught Mr. Miller how to swim. And he's going to give me a job at his car dealership. - Isn't that right? - Sure is. - Has Dad called? - No, he hasn't, sweetheart. I hear your father is fighting this fire. You worried about him? No, sir. That's a brave boy you got there, Jenny. Warren wants to learn about poetry. He's going to borrow a book from me. That's correct. I'll just go and fetch it. What do you have there? Toilet part. Real man of the house, huh? Doesn't he seem like a nice man? He fought in two wars but never learned to swim. Isn't that odd? That's not supposed to happen. Uh, Mom? - What is it? - I fixed the toilet. - What? - I... I fixed the toilet. Hold on. I'm on the phone, sweetheart. I'm sorry, it's just my son. What were you saying? Uh, what time's dinner? There you are. Where'd you go? I was going to make dinner. Well, how do you like this particular get-up? Looks nice. I used to dress like this all the time when I was younger. I'd stand behind the bull chutes at the rodeo and hope some cowboy would approve of me. Made my father very mad. They called us chute beauties. Isn't that an impressive thing to know about your mother that she was a chute beauty? Yeah, Dad told me about it. He said he liked it. Yeah, it's probably nice to know your parents were once not your parents. Who were you on the phone with? Don't worry. If it had been your father, I would have put you on. Do you like Miller? Oh, you mean Mr. Miller? Yeah, do you like him? Not very much. Things do happen around him though. He has that feel about him. And what's his wife like? He doesn't have one anymore. She left him, apparently. How would you like to skip school tomorrow? You know what they call trees in a forest fire? Fuel. You know what they call the trees left up when the fire goes by? They call them the standing dead. What happens to all the animals that live out here? They adapt, I suppose. Sometimes the little ones get confused and burn up. I used to cry about it when I was a kid but my father said that didn't help anything. You know what? He was right. That must be the stage-up. That's where the firefighters stay. Let's drive in and find Dad. I'm not going looking for him in this mess. Ugh, that sickening smell. Get out there. See what it feels like. Do you like it? No. You had to see what he finds so important. I'm sorry we both can't sympathize with him. How do you feel about your name? I've never thought about it. We chose it because it was plain. Joe. You could be anyone with that name. I suppose. Jeanette. I never liked that. It seemed like a waitress' name. What would you rather be called? Well, there used to be a singer named Ladie. Ladie-dah. - How would that be? - I like Jeanette. You have to like me the way I am. Anyway, I guess at my age, I don't have much choice. How old are you? I'm 34. Does that seem like the wrong age? Would you like it better if I said I was 507 No, 34 is alright. Alright. Well, I won't be this age forever so don't get used to it. [ Think your father has a woman out here. He wouldn't do that. No? Why do you think men do things? They either go crazy or it's a woman. Or it's both. I... I don't think that's true. You don't know anything. How could you? You haven't done anything. He's gonna be alright, Mom. Yeah. What about me? You're gonna be alright too. Where are we? That's Warren's house. Mr. Miller. I looked it up in the phonebook. What? Are we going inside? No. I had something to ask him, but it can wait. He doesn't live like a rich man, does he? Just a plain house on a plain street. I feel like I need to wake up.. But I don't know what from. Or to. That's a big change. Mom? Come on, let's get you home. - Hi, Dad. - Hi. Mm, looks good. I'll start the car and you can tell us about going back to the world fair today. - Did you have fun? - I sure did. Everything I saw was.. Mom? Mom? Hello? Joe, what's going on over there? - Why aren't you at school? - Oh, Dad, Dad. Are you okay? I'm fine. Where's your mother? Uh, she, uh.. She went into town, I.. H... how are things up there? It's a mess, really, but we don't have control over it. We just watch it burn. A... are you coming home soon? Uh, how's school going? - Can I help you, honey? - Oh; yes. I'm, I'm looking for my mother, Jeanette Brinson. Oh, I don't think we've had a customer by that name today. No, no, she... she works for Mr. Miller. Or maybe she's seeing him about a job. I don't think.. Cameron, look right there. Move a little closer. Yeah, that's perfect. Yeah, you look great. Alright. Mom? I Mom. Mom. Where have you been? You weren't there when I woke up. I'm sorry. Dad called. When? This morning. When you were gone. Did you have a nice chat about me? All my character flaws on parade? No, I... I think he misses us. Where'd you say I was? I said you went into town. Yes, I went to the dealership to get a few things done just to get started. You were there this morning? Don't worry. It'll only be part-time. I still have, a son to raise, I think. Here, put this on. Why? Mr. Miller invited us over for dinner. This is my desperation dress. What do you think? I think Dad would like it. I'm sure he would. And as much as he paid for. Those are the Helen Apartments. A couple of the girls from the Y live there. What would you think of that? Living by the river? I like our house. It's not our house, Joe. It's a rental. Ugh, Canada. I live near Canada now. My God! I can't stand Canada tonight. You look like a beauty pageant queen, Jeanette. I was on one occasion. You should always say nice things to women especially your mother. What will you have to drink, Jeanette? Oh, just a little something. Gotta keep my wits about me with you two. Tell me, Joe, how's your old man? - Is he coming home soon? - I hope so. Who's this? Oh, that's my wife.. Formerly. I'm sure she regrets leaving. Well, she hasn't called me up and said so. Poor old thing. Nobody's nice enough to you. It was never like this in Washington. Or Idaho. Every time we've moved, it's gotten colder. Your husband had to go where the work was. He had work in Idaho, but he insisted on leaving. You don't get anywhere if you don't try. I started with a small farm and simply never stopped trying for more. Well, that's different. You worked for your success. Jerry's always looking for a shortcut. He gets an idea in his head about what's gonna make him happy and he won't let go. I respect what your father's doing. When he comes home, I'm gonna discuss a job with him. Well, that... that's great. Isn't it, Mom? Well, I'm glad someone's here to take care of us. Tell me, Joe have you thought about what you want to do with your life? Uh, no, not really. Uh, maybe I'd like to work at a, a railroad someday. No, that's not very good. You need to come up with a better answer. - Kid's only 15, Jenny. - 14. See? Plenty of time. Your mother says you want to go to school back east. - Is that true? - No. [, I... I wanna go to school where my parents went. - Washington State. - No, you don't, believe me. You said you liked it there. Well, what do I know? I left before I hardly started. You wanna grow up to be like Warren. He went to Dartmouth. Yes, but I learned everything that meant anything in the army. But the army didn't make you rich. No. Other people's incompetency made me rich. Money begets money based on no other principle. Just because we're... poor doesn't mean we're incompetent. Of course not. But money begets money and that's how the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor, right? That's not what I'm saying at all. Would you mind very much telling me where the little girl's room is? Just through the bedroom. Put that record on, won't you? Have you ever been up in an airplane, Joe? No, sir. I own one. I could take you up sometime if you'd like. - Uh, yeah, sure. - We could take your mother. Once it was fall like now. Only colder. I was flying up to look at some poor man's failed crop and suddenly there were all these geese in formations, you know. Big Vs. Do you know what I did? I turned the engine off, 4000 feet up so I could listen. They were all around me honking and honking up in the sky where no one ever heard them except God Himself. And I thought.. This is like seeing an angel. It was the most wonderful thing I ever did in my life. Ever will do. Were you afraid? Yes, I was afraid. Because in that moment, I had lost all humanity. I had all these people on the ground trusting in me. My wife and my mother and my four businesses. But they didn't matter to me in the slightest. Not that I didn't care about them. I just didn't even think about them at all. Do you understand what I'm talking about, Joe? Yes, sir. You want a glass of wine? Yeah, okay. Here's to the angels.. And to your old man not getting burned up like a piece of bacon. Uh, thank you. Mm. Look now, the pretty lady's back. Why is it so gloomy in here? Someone put on some dancing music. - Oh, we'll dance. - Mom, I have homework. Cha-cha-cha. Cha-cha-cha. Come on, Joe. Dance with your mother. Come on. Joe, dance with your mother. Come, da.. Joe, come dance with your mother. Cha-cha-cha. Cha-cha-cha. There you go. Cha-cha-cha. Cha-cha-cha. Joel! Cha-cha-cha. Cha-cha-cha. Joe, you're a terrible dancer. I'm ashamed of you. Warren, you'll have to dance with me. There's nobody else. Cha-cha-cha. Cha-cha-cha. Cha-cha-cha. Cha-cha-cha. Look, Joe. Warren's a man who can dance. He's one in a million. Your mother is a very passionate dancer. Did you know that, Joe? It means I go till I drop. When Joe's father and I first got married I rented a little sailor costume and I did a little tap dance when he got home from work. It was an anniversary present. - He loved it. - I bet he did. We have to go. I'm irritable all of a sudden and Joe's bored. Well, you can't drive in this condition. - Stay the night. - No. Come on. There's another bedroom. I can drive us. Uh, Dad taught me. See? Joe can drive us. Well, you can put a coat on at least. Wait here. You don't mind, do you? No. I like driving. "Calm that experience.” That's what my mother used to call it when my father would roar in drunk. Don't worry, I'll get us home safely. You're a good boy. One day, you'll get a big promotion which is to say you'll be grown. You can leave. This should do the job. Don't you have one of your wife's coats? They're in a bag somewhere to be thrown away. Here. Come on, Joe. The fun's over. My heart's just pounding away. I drank too much. That makes your heart race. I don't wanna wear this coat. Mom! Can you imagine what the neighbors would say? Stay there. I'll be back in a minute. Well.. I surprised myself and had a good time. Did you? There you go. Can you smile? Get the smile. Across Northern Montana, we're still waiting for snow. The low tonight for Great Falls.. Local news.. Shh. Be quiet. Okay. I'm trying. Hurry up. Get dressed. Goddammit! You scared me! Oh, God! You scared me. You can... you cannot sneak up on me like that. I didn't mean to. What was he doing here? What does it matter? Do you love him? Do you still love Dad? He wants to make things better. Maybe I'm not up to that, I don't know. I wish I was dead. If you've got a better plan for me, tell me. I'll try it. Really. Maybe it will be better than this. I don't have one. Ah, hey. Oh, I thought I would never see you again. - How are you doing? - I'm good. Okay. Here. Here, Dad. Go on, put that up. Hi, Jean. Hello, Jerry. I don't know who I'm waiting to impress here. You smell like a campfire. Well, I should. I've been out in it. Are you hungry? No, we ate on the road. You must be tired. Come, sit down. Well, how was the fire? Did you put it out? Well, we got most of it. The snow should take out the rest. That's good. Yeah, it was, it was hell out there. Can't tell ya. I.. Had to stop a man from running in the fire. - I had to drag him down. - It sounds dangerous. It was. But I'm happy to be home. Well, we're glad you came:. I have some good news. I talked to a man up there about a job at the Forestry Department up at the eastern front. And they'd even provide us with a house. But we'd have to move again? Well, you know, it's not that far. And plus, it's a good time to be up there, you know. I have something to tell you too. What is it, Jean? I have taken an apartment in town.. For myself.. And I can move in tomorrow. It's a tiny place, but I can afford the rent and there's room for Joe if he wants to come. It's a surprise, I know. I'm surprised myself. Have you lost your mind, Jean? No, I don't think I have. Well, you can't... you can't get mad at me 'cause I went to some fire. I'm not. I was, I'm not anymore. Well, then what... what is it? Ah, I need some time to figure things out. Figure what out? Jean, are you stepping out on me? Yes, I am. But this doesn't have to do with that. Who is it? Who is it? Uh, it's Warren Miller. Miller? I've been teaching him at the Y. Oh, you've been teachin' him? Are you movin' in with him? Joe, go to your room. Jean, are you moving in with him? No, I told you, I'm taking an apartment. The Helen Apartments. They're down by the river. I know where they are. Christ! What? Are you... you havin' a, a hard week? - Is that it? - No, not very hard. Or are we not getting along? I think so. Bey, boy, boy! Boy! I won't have this conversation if you won't take me seriously. Stop it. Well, it's a wild life, isn't it, son? Leave him be. He doesn't know what is and what isn't. I think I'm wasted on you. I think you are too. It'd be nice to live on the eastern front. Don't you think? You think... your mother would take a chance on it? Yeah, sure, Dad. You know, she just needs something to believe in again. You'll see. Go on. Have some of that delicious pie. You know, I'm surprised about this Miller though. You know, I mean.. Has it been going on for a long time? I don't know. You know, I just, I don't believe that she would choose him. You know, he's an old man and.. He's married at that. He's not married anymore. What? You know him then? No, I.. I... I've met him once. When did you happen to meet him? He... he just stopped by the house. W... what happened when he stopped by the house? Nothing. He... he borrowed a book. You.. You never see him again? Where did you see him again? Mother and I went to his house. We had our dinner there. You did. When? A few nights ago. - Did you stay all night? - No. - No, we ate and then we left and -that's all. Did your mother do something that.. You wouldn't like to have to tell me about? Joe. Did you see them, uh, together? Yes. Where'd you see them? - They were in the house. - In our house? Dad! Dad. Dad. Dad, please, we should just go home now. Stay in the car, Joe. What the hell's going on? Jerry. Dad. - Dad, Dad. - Get out here, Miller! Dad, Dad. What's wrong with you? How could you? How could you do this? Dad. Jerry! Goddammit, Jerry! You are a goddamn drunk! You hear me, a fool and a drunk and you've ruined my house. - Fuck you, Miller. - No, no, no, no! Get away. Stop! Stop! Stop it! - Stop! - Who is that? - None of your business! - Where's my wife? How should I know? Goddammit, Jerry, you have a son here. What do you think"s gonna happen now? The police are coming. They'll put you in jail. I'd be ashamed. Come on. Joe. What are you standing around looking at? Joe, come on, come on, help me. Give me a hand. Joe. Joe! Yes? Can I help you? What is it, son? - Where did you go? - Are you okay? I went to the police station. I thought you'd be there. Oh, I... I, I talked to Mr. Miller and, uh.. We agreed that it was a misunderstanding.. And he's not gonna press charges. What's going to happen? Nothing. I'm in the clear. No, I mean, what's going to happen to us? Mom.. What's going to happen to us? I don't know. I'm going to bed. I have school tomorrow. Joe. I won't blame you if you hate me. Goodnight. Sorry, I'm late. That's okay. You eat? Yeah, we had something in town after school. Good. - Finish your homework? - Almost. Alright. Watch the game later? Ah, I... I promised Ruth I'd study with her but maybe I'll catch the end with you. Joe, letter for you. What does she say? Is she still in Portland? Yeah, she's fine. She... she wants to come visit and she bought a ticket. When? Uh, she arrives at 5:00 p.m. on the 20th. What, April 20th? That's tomorrow. Can I have the car? I can, uh, I can pick her up after school. Well, Joe, um, you don't know her plans. You don't know how long she's gonna be here for. I know. It... it's fine. Okay. Thanks, Dad. You've grown. Yeah, well, I'm trying. Couple more inches would be nice. But how's Oregon? It's not always what I expected, but I'm getting along. And how are your students? They're fine. - Yeah? - Some of them like me, I think. And I've made some good friends at work. - Joe tell you the good news? - What news? Dad. He made the honor roll again. - That's wonderful. - Thank you. - Can I.. - Sure. Thank you. And how is work, Jerry? Good. Turns out I do fine as a salesman. I'll send you some money when I can. Oh, you don't have to do that. Joe? So how long will you be here for? Just through the weekend. I have to be back at work on Tuesday. Uh, can you stop by the photo shop tomorrow? I, um, wanna show you something. - You're still working there? - Yeah, on weekends. - He's been promoted. - Is that so? Yes. Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm taking portraits now. But will you come by? Both of you. So we have some cameras and frames here and people can come, get their negatives developed. - You do that for them? - Yeah. Okay. And this is where we take all the portraits. Very official. Okay. So, Mom, sit here. Oh, no. I didn't even set my hair. No, that doesn't matter. It's just for me. And, Dad, you can sit here. Okay. Why don't I take a photo of you and your dad instead? Because I want one with all of us in it. Ready? Okay, hold still. One, two, three.
