BOHEMIA MOTION PICTURES presents The Seven Ravens Yes, there was a kingdom you could tell a story about. And also a royal family about which you could say various things. What are you doing, prince Bartholomew? Watch out, prince Norbert. There was also a dark wood, and in it, as in any good tale, there lived a witch. And boy, was she interesting. They say she had given birth to a kitten. There was also a village full of other fates and tales. One could mix facts with fiction, but the tale we are about to hear is about words that should not be used recklessly. It is about words that need to be laid out carefully like yeast bread. It was here, into the sweet smell of bread and the knot of many interwoven stories, that Bohdanka was born. There you go. After you'd given up all hope. The Lord's made it up to you. It was true. Little Bohdanka always made her parents happy. -This is for you, mother. -Thank you. And yet, however hard Bohdanka tried, the sadness never left her parents' eyes. If a child cannot gain attention by being good, they try being naughty. You lousy brats, filthy vermin, I'll break your arms! We'll hide here. When I catch you, I'll tear you to pieces! Come on, he won't find us here. {man shouting in the distance): Don't think you can run away again. {man shouting in the distance): You won't shake me off that easily! Why are there so many shoes here? What are you doing there? Children, you are not supposed to be up here. Go on, out with you! Momma would have preferred a boy, wouldn't she? Look, it's all for a boy. Don't talk nonsense. And come down as well. You're not supposed to be up here either. I'm hungry. Stop running, you're causing a draught! Let them be. Good heavens, look at your stitching! It's not a potato sack you are making! It's for Bohdanka to sleep under one day! Bohdanka! Bohdanka, please! Why don’t you say anything to her? She's doing it on purpose. The girl is growing up wild like weeds. When you are cross, you should keep quiet. None of the things she did would make her parents shout at her, as she had seen other parents do. Why are we making duvets when there are so many in the attic? Who were they for? And the shirts? Who was it all for? Why are you so sad again? You never even smile. Or get angry with me. Why won't you yell at me like other parents? Am I not worth the trouble? Bohdanka, you cannot do this to your mother! And because Bohdanka loved her parents, she stopped asking. It is often the case, you only begin to find out when you finally stop asking. Wait for me, girls! -Lift it! Careful! -Pull! Pull! Hurry up. Come on, hurry up! Let her down. Strap the horse in! Bring the horse! That's the queen sitting there, you good-for-nothings! -If he weren't a prince... -He'd be a princess. -Or if we were princesses. -Stop it. He must have spent ages in front of the mirror. Definitely longer than you. Look, another beau. There won't be much scramble for him. The queen is no longer seeking out a bride for him. N-n-no. Thank you. I wouldn't mind the stutter. But you know what they say? That he killed his father when he was little. Not intentionally, it was an accident. That's why he stutters, from the shock. He's heard you. The fact that someone stutters doesn't mean they are deaf. Or stupid like you. Bohdanka might have finally found a groom. I couldn't marry a murderer. Don't say that. There's not much to choose from in the village either. A half or a quarter of a groom there is for each girl. I'd go even for that. Pity about the baker boys. We could have had seven more grooms. My mum said that the eldest... Oh. Will anyone tell me what everyone except me seems to know? People say various things. Someone must know exactly what happened. I think that the only one who knows is her. I'm going away. I'm coming. Oh? Is this some kind of a meeting? Will you keep standing there, or will you finally come in? Come in and close the door, Bohdanka. You really are a witch, then? Maybe the girls just made that up. They also said the catfish in the pond is a water sprite. How did you know it was me? You expected me? You are a chatterbox, aren't you? I don't need to be a witch to know that, because you stomp around the forest. And regarding me knowing you are Bohdanka, well, you look exactly like... -You simply look like that. -I look like who? -Like Bohdanka. - look like a Bohdanka? -What does a Bohdanka look like? -Like me, doesn't she? Are you going to keep complaining or are you going to tell me why you have come? Have some, darling. I didn’t come here to find out that I look like myself. And if you're a witch, you must know why I'm here. Are you always this cheeky? No. Only when I'm scared. We have finally learned something interesting. Of course I know why you're here. Because of your brothers. You're not going to say anything now? You don't want to ask me? So it is true. What people say. Sit down. The truth never lies in words. What is said can only resemble the truth. Yes. You had brothers. Seven brothers. They had the same hair as you, the same eyes. The truth exists in the memory of those who saw it and lived it. And that is only their truth again. As one grows old, one forgets things. Sometimes gladly. This comb refreshes the memory. You just stroke the hair, and the past runs in front of your eyes like a living image. I don't want to remember any longer. You need your mother's memory. Memories she has buried so deep you can't reach them with questions. You just need to learn to listen to others' thoughts and ask the right questions. That is how she sat there. Just like you. I told your mother not to tempt fate, that she should be grateful for what she's got. That seven healthy boys is a great blessing. But she always wanted a girl. She wanted a magic spell from me. Human desire has more strength than most magic. You just need to be able to word it properly. Words have their power. But they need to be said at the right moment. -Tell me where you've been! -Bohdanka, where have you been? You never tell her anything, and this is the outcome. -She is tormenting us on purpose. -No, she isn't. I couldn't handle it again. Stay away from the shirts. What did she say? Divide dough for seven into eight parts. Bake eight loaves. Choose the most beautiful one, break it and utter your wish. Hey, Mark! Give it to me! Enough! May you turn into ravens! For every spell there must be a counter-spell. -There might be a way. -I'll do anything. -Anything? -Anything you tell me to. Anything you come up with, I'll do. Your brothers were transformed by your mother's words. You will now have to give up all spoken and written words so that your silence gives power to your words. Do you understand? To the wish you will have to voice when the time comes. -Oh? And when do I have to go silent? -Now. Can you sew? Man differs from animals by covering his nakedness. You will sew shirts for your brothers, which together with your silence will return their human form. To each of them. Without anyone else's help. You will spin the thread, you will weave the cloth and you will sew every single stitch. When you finish the shirts, you can speak and say your wish. Excellent. But the shirts will not be ordinary shirts. You will set out immediately to the Blue Rocks through the Black Forest. You are talkative even without words, aren't you? No, no. You can't say farewell to your parents. It was your mother who transformed your brothers. And her pain is unfortunately a necessary ingredient. I knew it. I shouldn't have shouted at her. I should have cut my tongue out. You will set out across the Black Forest today. No one must find out where you are and no one must look for you. You will find a brook in the valley that will lead you up to the peaks of the mountains. There, deep in the forest, you'll find a clearing called the Green Sea. That's your destination. From the nettles of the Green Sea and from your pain, you are to spin thread, weave cloth, and make shirts for your brothers. Up in the rocks, you will find a spacious cave. That shall be your home now. A woman is like a horse. -Like a horse? -Yes, like a horse. When she realizes you are soft, she can do anything she wants with you. You mustn't be afraid of women. I think it's easier with horses after all. Pigs. Wild pigs. Look at the tracks. I told the gamekeeper to put a fence around. There'll be no food for mouflons and thus no mouflons for us and we'll have to shoot these stupid wild pigs. Wait. There's another one. Wait, there might be yo-you... Yo-you... The younger, the better. We can't leave it here like this. So what? Shall I waste another bullet? This is an ideal catch for you. It's hardly moving. Go on, hero. Look, our piglet. Why are you throwing stones at us? You mean it would be better if she threw something else? Girl, you don't throw anything at princes. At most, you throw yourself into their arms. Where are you running off to with the carrion? That's our hunting ground. Our raven. You want to poach? Our little black boar has turned mute. -Let it be. -No way. That's precisely your mistake. You're scared of women. That's the problem. Norbert, let her go. You'll pay for that. Why are you shooting, you idiot? We want her alive, don't we? I'm not shooting at her, I'm shooting at you. You are an idiot, a stuttering idiot. I know I'm not a good marksman, but I don't want to shoot your horse. Why? Because I quite like your horse. Why are you doing this? I'm an idiot. I don't know why I'm doing it. Jesus! That was close. But he'll live. How did this happen? A hare? Away. A pig, a pig, a wild pig. Running... A wild pig, running. No, no. Two... On a horse. Two on a horse. A handsome one on a horse. An idiot. A handsome idiot. A handsome idiot on a horse. Shooting. Shooting. So it was that one. He shoots at anything that moves. But you arrived on time. Royal blood. What brothers they are. What do you say, darling? I was with him when he died. The king fought to his last breath, I told my brother, but he was always so stubborn. It's not true. He must return. He promised. He must return to see our child. We wanted to announce it when he comes back. He was so happy the kingdom would finally have an heir. I know how you feel. I wanted to wait with the news until you returned, dear, but now we need all the good news there is. We are also expecting. The Lord takes and gives. But you have us, and we'll take care of you. Be careful, dear. -Your highness. -Give me your hand. Thank you. Come in the bath too. You know I'm not into that much. What do you wish for your child? That it's a boy. You hear? You are to be a boy. And what do you wish? Me? That the child is healthy and has a long life. And that... You can be what you like. Has it started? Give it to me and go. Quick! But not midwife Jansen, every other child dies on her. You need to go to Křečská behind the woods. But that's... -Go, go. I'll wait with her, it'll take some time. Have some more, it'll make you feel good. That is surely the devil's work. Where's my child? Where's my child? Take care of him, It's not his fault. I'm not a witch, do you hear? I'm not a witch. -Burn her! -I'm not a witch. I'm not a witch! If they take you for a witch, it's better to be one than not. But why? Let us pray. You know what? Regarding witches, the good witches, it is more complicated than people think. A good witch can help others, but never herself. So that time she helped me and when she told me how, I helped her. She taught me a lot, And this comb is from her too. You can keep it. You might need it one day. I can't help myself anyway. I know I told you a wish is stronger than magic. But maybe not always. My wish has come true anyway. Twenty years is a long life for a tomcat. And he's healthy too. Should I have wished for my child not to be a cat? He shouldn't fly yet. So it was Prince Bartholomew who helped you. I have the right to be curious too, haven't [? What? Yes or no? Does he still stutter? Go on then. Do you always throw stones, or just at me? You needn't be scared. My brother is hunting elsewhere today. Can you hear me? You're keeping an eye on her, boys. I just wanted to know how he's... He's probably still angry. Do you live here? What is that for? Nettles. That must have stung. Oh, drying. I don't know that. A spinning wheel. Sewing. So you are making shirts here. But why? When I'm relaxed, I almost stop stuttering. But I'm almost never relaxed. It's easier with you. Most people start talking before I finish. And I get nervous. Why don't you speak? You can't tell me that. Nevermind. I deserve it. Thank you. It doesn't matter. I'll be going. I told my brother it's not the best idea. You don't have a vase, do you? I'll be happy to help you. What do you want? Leave that coat be! What's going on? I must take her away. Now she needs to rest. You've gone mad! When you brought ill kittens and birds, I tolerated it. When you brought in an injured mouflon, I thought, poor stuttering boy, he's got no friends, so at least the dumb creatures. But this is too much. What is it anyway? Mother... Norbert has told me everything. Also about your secret trips and all that nonsense you do together there. The fact that someone is a greater lunatic than you, doesn't mean that we shall keep them here, so that you can feel normal. Come on, Norbert. What are you waiting for? What are you waiting for? Get hold of her. That's not the best idea. Heavens, I'm in shock! Those beasts. What are you waiting for? Make them get lost. Now! Let them be. Don't hurt them. Norbert! I'm not touching her. No one is touching her. -How dare you? -Mother. -Don't be cheeky to mother. -And you be quiet as well. The girl stays here and you behave nicely to her. As to a princess, and maybe the future queen. What queen? -How come you're not stuttering? He's not stuttering. He's not. How come you're not stuttering? I'm just not. Even if I stuttered or bleated like a goat, I'm still your first born and the successor to the throne. Of course. But it's all a surprise. That I could be a king? Or that I don't stutter? Well, it's a great piece of news. That you don't stutter. The king part is certainly very interesting... Now that you don't stutter. Because of course you are first born, and so, despite the misfortune with your father, which was almost not your fault, it is clear that you might want... But mother, you said... Come on, Norbert. Such a happy occasion. We must celebrate it. We'll leave you here, so that the patient can rest. She must rest. Everything is okay. You need to lie down. I know, those shirts. But first you have to get fit, then you can go and burrow yourself in the nettles. Okay, but you can do it in a dry and warm place. I'm stronger, so if we fight, I win. I hope. I don't stutter. You don't shut your mouth even when you don't open it at all, do you? Sleep. Make sure she has everything she needs. Yes, your highness. -You can go. -Shouldn't|...? -That can wait. Go. Do you think it's too tight? But it makes the shoulders wider. Have you noticed that Bartholomew doesn't stutter? Do you know what it means? But your only worry are your tight clothes. -He might start stuttering again. Great! You want to just wait and see if your brother starts to stutter. When did Bartholomew start to stutter? When that stone fell on father. So... So something would have to fall on you, mother. We have no other relatives. -He has to get a shock. -From what? -You have to shock him. “Why me? Because you want to be the king. -I'm not so sure about that. -Sure you are. Take more of it. From the back. I know. He doesn't stutter anymore, but he's gone crazy. There's still some left. Mother said that prince Bartholomew was a very good child. A quiet one. Grateful for every caress. We don't talk about that. It doesn't sting at all. No, stop it. Marie... Not that I find this type of dress unbecoming, but as our guest is going to have dinner with us tonight... Do you understand? -Of course. It must be somewhere at the back. I always hid there as a child. Here it is. I always liked this one. Do you think it's a good idea? We won't wait. Norbert. What is she wearing? Why did she put that on? Don't you find it in bad taste? No. It's not exactly the latest fashion... You know what I mean. If you mean that all the maids and some ladies wear the same unbecoming dress, then yes, that's in bad taste. Enough. The fact that you've stopped stuttering doesn't mean you can talk back to your mother. -I wouldn't dare. It just seems inappropriate to take out an old dress and remind everyone of the misfortune. Besides, its not proper that this... That the forest girl eat with us at the royal table. Please. The girl stays. She's my guest. And I ask you, mother, to treat her accordingly. Of course. As you wish. We will have to get used to changes now. But we shall cope. Shan't we, Norbert. Don't take me wrong, but what shall we call you? Are you okay? Are you all right? I'm... What's the matter, mother? Mother! Norbert! - didn't mean it. Let's go. What was that supposed to mean? But you did get startled, didn't you? Wait. Stay here. Stay here forever. Mother will get over it. She'll get used to you. She doesn't mean it. It's just the way she is. Please. Don't leave me here. I would never get used to that again. What if I started to stutter again? -Mother, I would... -Don't go anywhere. Take the dress away. We can't do it this way. But you did get startled, mother. Am I stuttering now? It can't be done physically only. He's not five anymore. We have to find something... Something that will do what we need. Such as? Something spiritual. Do you understand? Spiritual. Are you always this diligent? When I told you I wanted you to stay forever, you know what I spoke about, don't you? I would like you to stay not just like that... But as... as... As... As... daddy? Ouch. Wait. Careful! But who was it then? Does it really matter? Now that I'm going to have a wife who'll save me from all ghosts? I haven't asked you yet, have 12 Would you like to go inside? Will you, please, marry me? Please. What the hell? What the... Ru-Rudolf. Mum. Mum! Norbert! I know it didn't work out. Guards, fire! But I think that's the right way, he was really shocked for a while. But then his what's-her-name... Exactly. I think we're not doing it right. We have to concentrate on her. Shall I try to scare her? Women are easier to shock. No, no, Norbert, don't scare anyone. But you did get a shock, didn't you? Yes, Norbert. I did get a shock. I have this not exactly good piece of news. If we want to concentrate on her, we'd better do it quick, because he's just asked for her hand. What? Probably from the shock. And then they kissed. So... Very well. We’ll have to take a different approach then. Yes. I know we got off on the wrong foot, as they say. But now you are here, I'm very glad in fact. Bartholomew is really thriving. He's smiling all the time. Don't stare, Norbert. You should follow your brother's example and find someone too. But mother... Don't mother me. You always find excuses. Mother, we wanted to... We wanted to tell you something. Do you think I don't know? I've been watching you, children. I wanted to suggest it myself. What did you want to suggest? I quite like weddings. Seeing it, I think I might get married after all. But you need a bride for that. Don't worry, we'll think of something. Now wave. No, no, don't be worried, child. Despite all the confusion, I'm happy it ended like this. Every mother wants her son to marry well. But Bartholomew was lucky. Very lucky. Pity his father didn't live to see it. -Your wife and I have been talking. -I'm glad. But maybe you should talk to Norbert. He's asking your dressmaker to marry him, the married one with twelve grandchildren. Exactly. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. You will now have your own family. Norbert almost didn't get to know his father. It was a terrible thing. And I'm not young. He doesn't care what I tell him. In short, I worry for him. He's just pretending. I know how much he longs for a family, for love. But his personality... There has never been a man to show you how things are in life. I don't like to remind you, you know. I'd just like to know that I can rely on you that you'll help me with Norbert, That you'll look after him when necessary. When I'm no longer here. Mother, you can rely on us, we'll take care of him, -Don't move! -Leave me be! Come, come. Why do you put unripe fruit there? She needs the best now. One has to take care of everything. Here, birdie. What shall I do with the boy? Like this, he'll be your responsibility when I'm no longer here. Mother, please. Norbert. Come on, stop it. I don't think it's a good idea. You'll go and that's that. I can't look at this any longer. She's almost forty and I've never seen her. What if she's horrible? So she's horrible, as long as she's rich and noble. -And single. For quite a while. Stop kidding around. This is serious. Write: Noble Helga... Helga? No... Most noble Helga, we cordially accept your invitation... Bart, Bart! You must go after your brother. You must immediately follow Norbert. The poor boy insulted princess Helga. They say he even bit her. They put him in jail. If he doesn't apologise, which he surely won't, I don't know what they'll do to him. There might even be war! Norbert isn't crazy, he'll apologise. And if not, when the baby is born, I'll go. It might be too late by then. God knows what's in the boy's head. If he was all right, why would he have bitten her? Do you want me to suffer to death? -You must go right now. -But it's a four-day journey. I'll take care of our little queen. And the baby will wait. You understand, don't you? You'll be a mother too. I can't leave my child there without help. You're the future king and father. You can't think only of yourself. Don't worry, mother will take care of you. Put it there. We can't leave you here alone. Darling, have some tea, it'll make you feel good. I can stay here with her highness. You can go. One can't leave such things to the servants. I promised Bartholomew I'd take care of you. And so I will. You're not going to go to sleep yet? Of course, as you wish. It won't disturb me. If anything happens, wake me up, okay? He was so happy the kingdom would finally have an heir. I know how you feel. I wanted to wait with the news until you return, dear, but now we need all the good news there is. We are also expecting. What do you wish for your child? That it's a boy. You hear? You are to be a boy. And what do you wish? Me? That the child is healthy and has a long life. And that... Leave it here and go. I'll stay with her. This will make you feel good. It's coming! This will relieve you. This family is cursed. As soon as I saw them flying about, I thought it strange. How they stuck with her. They look so ominous. A raven is an animal embodiment of the devil. is it not, father? It is true that it's all black. The kitten was better than this! It's true she's not dumb for no reason, Daughter, if you have something to say as an explanation, now is the time. Poor son of mine. He doesn't deserve this. Good thing he's not here. It can't be helped. Guards! The guards better not see it. Go and give this to the prince. You needn't hurry. By the time the prince returns, it will be over. We better spare him this. In the fire! Woman, if you can say anything on your behalf, do so now. Speak and repent! Hurry up! May you turn into people again! Can't you put the stake on fire? Make sure it burns properly. What are you waiting for? She's doing witchcraft right in front of you. Burn them all. Burn them! Burn them! It's prince Bartholomew! Poor boy. Did you get my letter? I met the messenger in front of the gates. How come you... Why are you here so early? 'We have called him. -Where is our child? Let her go. -These are my brothers. -You speak! You have brothers? Son, [ know it's terrible, but she has just confessed. In front of everyone's eyes, she bewitched the ravens into these black devils. We have to stop this before a misfortune happens. -She can explain it. - can explain it. Why explain anything? Now she'd want to explain. Why was she silent the whole time? Tie them all up and put them on the stake. -You can't do that. Believe me, I only want what's best for you. -I'm your mother. -But you're not his mother. Do you see? That's too much. Trust me, please. Are you going to trust a witch instead of your mother? 1, who brought you up? 1, who loved you? Even though you caused the death of your father and my beloved husband? -Don't trust her. -Don't trust anyone! It's all words. Trust your feelings. I hadn't trusted my feelings for a long time. I didn't believe that what I felt could be true. Albeit complicatedly true. Don't trust them, don't trust anyone. She only tries to talk you into believing a lot of nonsense. She's right. Why should you trust me? No! Bohdanka, I think this hair needs combing. I also avoided the truth for a long time. Don't be like me. Please, don't take after me at least in this one thing. You must have a lot of questions. So comb her hair. You'll find the answers. It's a sign, it's a sign. It's God's sign. God has sent us a sign. Let them go! Let them go! Let them go, but drive them out of the kingdom. May they never return. Otherwise they will end up on the stake. You need to ask the right questions. Comb. Put him on the floor. On the floor. If you so much as open your mouth, you know what to expect. Welcome the successor to the throne, prince Bartholomew. Prince Bartholomew, you can't. You know stones fall off the walls. You could get killed. Come, Norbert, Come on. Come on. Watch out, Bartholomew! D-d-daddy! Lord, you take and give in your all-knowing wisdom. We accept your will with humbleness, for your will is a father's love who loves most of all. It is terrible, but it was a heroic deed. He saved the future king. I know I should not have been playing there. I don't want to be king. No one will force you, darling, don't worry. How could you? I'll explain. Everything can be explained. We just need to explain everything. Get hold of her. -But your highness... -Get hold of her. Enough! You know the truth. Now you will have to tell everyone else. Words again. That day Bartholomew spoke for a long time, Bohdanka also spoke, even the brothers spoke. Those who previously could not speak or could not speak properly spoke out. People talked about that day long after. But they also talked about other things. About the wicked witch Alexandra turning to ashes in jail. She hurt us all. Is that what you really want, mother? Take her outside the walls in the morning. People talked about how prince Norbert decided to marry a toothless hundred-year-old countess rather than return home. -How does a piggy go? -Come here, you wild boar. They're coming! They also said that when Bohdanka's brothers finally returned to their parents, the whole village welcomed them as heroes, Magic will always be magic. They are said to still turn into ravens at night. Have you seen the youngest one? He's said to have feathers under his shirt. Forgive me, mother. You forgive me, daughter. Boys! My boys! Father. This is František, mother. The oldest used to eye me. I was slim as a twig. People say a lot of things just to have something interesting to listen to. But whatever they say, it does not affect the truth. Truth flies high above us. So high so that no words, neither good, nor bad ones, could ever really destroy it.
