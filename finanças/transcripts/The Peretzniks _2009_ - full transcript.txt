That's you there in 3rd grade, the end of school year… After the war, like many Jewish children, I found myself at the orphanage in Helenowek. I was sent to the Peretz School right after it was opened. When I graduated in 1957, many Jews from Lodz chose to emigrate, mainly to Israel. I stayed. I returned to Peretz after graduating from university…this time as a teacher - Everyone remembers right?… - You were a good kid, polite… I decided to go to Israel only after they closed down the school in 69 Who? Heniek? Great! - Of course! - Shalom My behavior at school was 'unsatisfactory' … This film is about my Jewish school, its students, and the people who created it and who are now scattered all around the world. Oh, this is Tosia… Not Tosia but Tonia In 1st grade nothing was taught in any other language but Yiddish, they even taught Polish in Yiddish I was neither Polish nor Jewish, I was just Sara, I was simply a human being I don't think we considered ourselves Jews. We felt that we were Poles of Jewish origin. I was 100% Polish and 100% Jewish and I never thought one conflicted with the other in any way I never had any identity issues. I think we had a Christmas tree with real candles on it I always felt Polish, Poland was my homeland. For me… the Polish army… I was a true Polish patriot I am a Jewish child and a Polish flower Pre-war Lodz was one of the economic and industrial centers of Europe It was also a meeting point for many different cultures and nationalities. This so called 'Promised Land' was inhabited by Poles, Jews and Germans, but also Czechs, Russians, Austrians, English, French, and the Italians. Both culture and business flourished in Lodz In both areas, Jews were among the successful ones. Before the war they accounted for about 1/3 of the city's population. World War II brought about the most tragic events in the history of Lodz Jews. The Lodz Ghetto became the second largest after the Warsaw one, and it existed longer than any other ghetto in Nazi-occupied Europe. 60 thousand Jews perished in the Lodz ghetto alone. Another 130 thousand Lodz Jews were murdered in death camps. After the war Lodz turned out to be one f the least destroyed Polish cities A handful of those who survived in the ghetto were now joined by some 50 thousand Polish Jews, who survived the war mainly in the Soviet Union. Slowly, Jewish life in Lodz was being revived. LODZ, POLAND In 1945 the Yitzchak Leyb Peretz Jewish School was established in Lodz, Named after one of the leading Yiddish writers in Poland. KILINSKI STREET More and more kids were enrolling in the Peretz School and, despite its shabby building on Kilinski Street 49, the school was soon considered the best Jewish teaching facility in post-war Poland. We used to always walk to school in groups, of 2 or 3. We walked in groups because it was more fun, and because sometimes it was… safer. The school meant everything. It was a place for study, for fun, for frienship… Ballet, shows, culture. It was everything. The Peretz School was my love, my home, my life. I never found anything like it in my life. It was everything, it was our entire world The school was my entire life It was my family, it was my home We were a very close-knit bunch, the things we did together …you would not believe We all knew each other inside out… really, and we had an immense tolerance for one another. Everyday together… it created friendships, which are important forever The school provided meaning in my life It was no regular school, for me it was a way of life, really. Back, when the Jewish school was 'really Jewish' we didn't go to school on Saturdays, but on Sundays. As we walked to school, we saw empty streets you know… On Sundays everyone's either in church or sleeping or something, and there we were with our school backpacks. Getting to school by tram on Sunday with a schoolbag wasn't easy. Only Jewish kids had bags like those, you could see them from afar… The whole tram would laugh and murmur something Our parents asked for us to have classes on Saturdays, instead of Sundays, like everybody else. Those Jews of Lodz who sent their children to a Jewish school did so partly in order to familiarize them with elements of Jewish tradition, but partly also in order to protect us from the outside world. And so the school became our only reality TEL AVIV, ISRAEL (singing in Polish language) Oh, I'm so happy… 20 years... Hanka, you haven't aged at all… Here's my sweetheart You must take a look at me here. I was always tall and beautiful, and for being so beautiful they cut off my head of like this... This is me in kindergarten Graduation at the Peretz Jewish School Graduation at the Peretz Jewish School As I was leaving Poland, everyone asked me „Why are you going, kid?”, I just put my head down, I had nothing to say, I was a young girl… I have friends all over the world, I don't know if we would be so close now if we had stayed in Poland. Our life stories are so alike, though I live in Israel, Heniek is in Canada, and Golda stayed in Poland. When I go back to Poland, I see the willow trees, forests… My God how I miss that… In Israel, I see the red sunshine and those colors you know, like in van Gogh the colors in Israel are beautiful. In Poland on the other hand you have so much green and the houses are grey. In Israel... In Israel everyone is nervous and obnoxious, but when there is war or shootings, everyone is suddenly together. And I don't know where I am, I am completely divided between two worlds, and at age 60 I still don't know who I am, maybe you can tell me…? In 1956 most of our classmates left Poland. They opened the borders then and allowed emigration. And so the Jewish population shrunk instantly from 80 thousand to 30. 50 thousand Jews left. One of the people, who left in 1956 was Daniel Libeskind, NEW YORK, USA one of the most renowned contemporary architects. We were among the first Jews to leave to Israel, it was kind of an expulsion but we were kind of a happy to be part of it. I remember the people that moved into our apartment had already slept in the apartment while we were there sleeping, to make sure that they get the possession of the apartment. So had nothing except of fear... During the time, when Jews were allowed to leave Poland for Israel, a wave of Jewish repatriants returned from the Soviet Union, which was forbidden by Stalin until then. A new crowd of kids appeared at the Peretz School and you could now hear Russian in the hallways. ASHKELON, ISRAEL Wow, so many years, so many years.. At the end of the 60s and the beginning of the 70s some 20 thousand Jews left Poland. Now, every two or three years, Polish Jews from all over the world reunite in Ashkelon in Israel. The Peretniks are always well represented. 40 years, but I recognized them, I recognized them, I did Most Peretzniks lived in the very heart of Lodz, just a few blocks away from each other. And the school was the actual central to their lives. The school was a kind of oasis for us. Lodz was quite antisemitic at the time and the school gave us a feeling of security As Jews, we grew up in an atmosphere of a potential war, even the Polish population felt this way At school, we could talk freely about who we were, but God forbid that someone should hear us outside I felt safe there, at the school It was like a little Jewish nook in Lodz, which wasn't very friendly I don't think I even knew of any other schools, I always say that I crossed over to the 'Aryan side' only after graduation It was a kind of seclusion within our own community where we knew nothing bad could happen, while outside it could be dangerous The Peretzniks' favorite Polish literature teacher - Mrs. Kwiatkowska Lives in Lodz till this day. Come in. We have green tea here, I see… No, this is mate, not green tea! Don't dare to spill it! Let's see what we're saying here - We talk about them all the time - I remember all the teachers. Polish was taught by Mrs. Kwiatkowska Who I was a bit of a nuisance for sometimes… - Once, but seriously I liked her very much nevertheless Mrs. Kwiatkowska – she was romantic. She taught us beautiful Polish literature, She taught us how to explore it, - Hania Blumsztajn?! Oh God... - to discover this beautiful literature. And I am still a romantic myself, and I follow my heart and not my head, This is Mrs. Kwiatkowska's influence. We absolutely loved her, she was a great teacher. I remember dancing with Mrs. Kwiatkowska, she was a very tall woman, and I was… I was just as tall at age 12 as I am now, She was so much taller than me, I was a big deal for me, And I still carry very pleasant thoughts of her - Is this Faszczyk? I liked him a lot. She was a very good and warm person and teacher I think it stuck with all of us, and that's why we are so close, that romanticism… And that's why most of us do not have the most normal lives, but we have interesting ones. TORONTO, CANADA After the war, Jewish parents were reluctant to tell their to tell their children about the Holocaust, about lost grandparents, uncles, cousins, or siblings, Nor did they tell them about the events, which took place in Poland after the war, Such as Kielce pogrom. This is our classroom… and is this Sarenka? The Peretzniks were brought up somewhat unaware of what the outside world was like. - Sarenka was in your class? - Oh wait, I've got this once... Only as teenagers did they begin to understand why were so well protected, watched-over, kept in a Jewish school, and fed a mandatorily second breakfast. - This is Lucek. - That's me. - And this is me.. At our school, there were children of intelligentsia. None at all, there were no doctors or lawyers, they didn't send their children to the Jewish school. Who was at our school? Only the poor. When in sixth grade the teacher asked Ester Baum, why she hadn't come to school, She said that her father was getting her shoes repaired And why didn't you put on another pair? 'They're the only pair I own.' Children of the intelligentsia or the richer kind were sent to Polish schools. (jazz music) They said that the State of Israel should be established in Birobijan, then in Uganda, and later on Madagascar, and so we chose… Canada (laugh) Most of us had no family, no grandpas no grandmas, I didn't even know that such things existed, I only had parents All of my polish friends had grandmas and grandpas... I didn't even know who is a 'grandma' or 'grandpa'... Since a was a little kid I always thought that in a Jewish family there is no notion of grandparents, there are only parents. All of a sudden it turns out that there are other kids like me, who have no aunts or uncles or anybody else Family was replaced by friends This bond we shared somehow replaced the family we were missing The school was a kind of children's home, yeah, that's how it was… laughter through tears LODZ, POLAND Most of the boys had a crush on the young physics teacher Miss Wanda Minich Thank you so much, it's very nice of you… I was very young and for me to have contact with people who experienced so much… It was shocked that they could be very happy Oh! Miss Wanda, the physics teacher, we used to drop pencils on the floor, so that we could get under the tables and peep on that lady, she was the prettiest… She was our physics teacher, I know! I know exactly, she would appear in our dreams, not only mine… (laugh) Miss Wanda was our physics teacher and she was a very beautiful woman and us kids we were simply crazy about her and would do anything to please her. Unfortunately, she was my teacher only for a while, I was very sorry because of this… I am absolutely shocked, really never thought that I was perceived in this way... I was a just an ordinary young girl and that's it When I was younger I used to say I didn't want to be Jewish. First of all I didn't know what Jewish meant. I would ask my mom in the street „is this a Jew?” „Yes” "And this?” „No” „And this?” „No” „So how do you know who is Jew?” Then I would ask if our cat was a Jew, because we had a cat. I asked my mom „Mommy when do I have my first communion?” And so mom said I have good news and bad news, the good, bad news is you are Jewish. As a child I didn't understand what any of this was about, but I knew you weren't supposed to talk about being Jewish or about Israel When I was 6 or 7 I thought we must have moved to Poland from a foreign country and that's why they hate us They would call us 'dirty Jew' or would say that your parents drew blood for matzah I didn't want to be Jewish in Poland back then. I even... remember myself in front of the mirror asking my mother „do I like look a Jew?” „No, no, it's just that all Jews look like you” I was very unhappy „look at this fat Jewess”… my mother was very big… „How fat she grew on Polish blood” When I heard that Jews killed Christ I used to say it couldn't have been us, maybe the Rubinsteins from upstairs 'cos they're not very nice, but it surely wasn't us who killed Christ My father definitely didn't kill Christ because he's back from work every day exactly at 5pm XXVII Lyceum by the name of Peretz. Usually, everyone else wore it sowed onto their unforms but we normally kept it on a rubber band and took it off so as not to get into a fight or be laughed at… The kids would yell: „Jew, a Jews is coming” and I don't know if they would do anything but I was afraid it wasn't the nicest thing to be a Jew in Poland at that time, especially one like me, who everyone could tell My name was Yitzek, if anyone looked at my nose they could tell right away… Most average people wouldn't think at first glance that I was a Jew, unless I met an 'expert' to be a Jewish child in Poland back then was scary, It was scary to walk down the street there were street or districts even where I would never go, 'cos I would be scared to go we tried to walk out if the school in groups, at least a few people It was constant daily challenge to survive the day in a way that was dignified If someone said to me „you dirty Jew” I didn't cross the street, but rather let them know in my own way that I will not have them talk to me like this I didn't like fighting… It wasn't a good place for me, I don't know… I felt like a coward but where was it written that people are supposed to like us for being Jews…? I met a girl and we started dating. When she found out that I was Jewish, I never tried to hide it so she found out right away… She said her parents wouldn't let her be around me at all, but I also had many friends who were Polish… First of all Poles are gentlemen, secondly down with the Jews, bring on the Jewesses – and so on… I know that many boys suffered, they were beaten up, nobody hit the girls, they would pick on us, oh what a pretty little Jewess, this was no compliment, it was an insult, I had girlfriends who took me to church and I brought them to synagogue so there were no issues. Personally, I suffered no antisemitism in my neighborhood I was dark, I had dark braids and everyone knew I was Jewish and nobody called me names, nobody punched me… Everyone knew we were Jews and there were no differences Personally, I didn't feel anything, except that they chased Jews in the park with dogs… But myself, I felt just fine Toward the end of the 60s only some 30 thousand Jews were remaining in Poland. However, their future in Poland was suddenly put to question. In June of 1967 the Six Day War broke out between Israel and the Arab countries. Under Soviet pressure, Poland broke off diplomatic relations with Israel. Israel's victory evoked anti-Israeli attitudes in Poland, which resulted in an official antisemitic campaign. - They must be condemned! On Monday June 5th Israel opens aggression. Other countries of the Arab world full supported Cairo in the fight with Israel. Suddenly there is war and several hours of uncertainty and fear about was's happening over there, suddenly the is victory, and this great joy… Pro-Israeli attitudes were abvious then, because Egypt was generally associated with the Soviet Union, and anything that was associated with the Soviet Union evoked negative attitudes On the second day of the Six Day War I worked at the Polish special of the Folks Shtyme daily and the courier brought a special bulettin with an instruction on the first page: attention, attention: change of the cover title. The main article was now “Israel's Agression on Arab Countries” and you knew right away that the general mood has changed, and which side Poland was now on… Archives: Robotnicy z transparentami: "Deal with the Zionist Fighters" "Cleanse the Party of all Zionists" "Down with the new 5th Column" During Israel's aggression against the Arab states a number of Jews have expressed the desire to go to Israel and participate in the war against Arabs. Without a doubt, this category of Jews, citizens of Poland, are emotionally and mentally tied to the State of Israel. They are all surely Jewish nationalists. When Gomulka gave that speech in June 67 about us being a 5th column because we were pleased with Israel's victory, because we were pleased that Jews in Israel didn't allow themselves to be killed, liked they did in Poland, I knew already that I had nothing more to do in such Poland At that time the press would publish material about an alleged Jewish conspiracy and secret dealings with Americans or even Faschists. Emigration to Israel was perceved as an enthusiastic escape from Poland under the wings of a Zionist-fashist-american wealth. The peak of the campaign was March 1968 The students who protested against the regime were brutally attacked by militia. The Communist Party's 1st Secretary Wladyslaw Gomulka claimed that the leaders of those protests were students of Jewish origin. This was meant to justify the widespread witch-hunt for Jews, controlled directly by the secret services. Poles of Jewish origin were fired from work by the score, which was only one of the ways to urge them to leave Poland. These events affected nearly entire Jewish population, including those who had previously beed unaware of their Jewish roots. In 68 it became obvious that Jewish existence in Poland was coming to an end – We got in a tram and Ela was maybe 17 at the time, I was 18, and we heard the people say 'too bad Hitler didn't get rid off them all…” This cannot be about me, when Gomulka yelled about the 5th column I kept saying to myself that he means some other people, some bad people - Tthe press, especially in Lodz, practically encouraged pogroms! - I felt very good in Poland and I didn't want to leave in 68 “you know, Mr. Chmielnicki, we honestly don't need people like yourself at out Technical Academy”… - All of a sudden it turns out that you are a guest in your own country - I felt that I wasn't wanted in this Poland I remember Gomulka's speech, mom said we had to watch it and then she said we might have to leave "Wieslaw, Wieslaw, Wieslaw" "Long live the secretary!" I remember Gomulka's speech very well, it was frightening, shocking, suddenly your entire future is put to question Gomulka: Dear and respected comrades, During the past 10 days important things have taken place in our country. A significant number of students in Warsaw and in other academic centers have been deceived and led astray by anti-socialist forces. In these events an active role was played by academic youth of Jewish origin or nationality - It was this feeling of... a complete loss of shelter, of protection, I felt as if I was thrown into the lion's cage "Off to Israel! Now!" - At school we used to think that even when the kids would throw stones at us Gomulka: comrades, please remain calm it didn't really matter because we were protected, by the constitution and generally somehow protected You always had this notion that nothing bad can happen to us 'cause we were Jews, that officially this was impossible Gomulka: are there Jewish nationalists in Poland followers of the Zionist ideology? "There are!" Gomulka: Comrades, of course there are And then a sudden breakdown, this fake shelter disappeared Gomulka: I suspect that this category of Jews will leave our country sooner or later "Today! Today!" Gomulka: We are ready to prepare emigration visas for those who consider Israel to be their homeland. "Today!" Gomulka: Attention, comrades "Today!" Gomulka: they haven't applied yet When he said that Jews can apply to go to Israel, the crowd yelled “Now! Right away!” I remember that After the March events in 68 my Polish friends wanted me to move in with them, they didn't want me to be alone, they would take me to work and pick me up afterwards everyday. This was very significant. The situation back then, even though I didn't feel it so much, was such that my Polish friends actually began to fear for me. The school being shut down was very painful for me, becouse everything broke apart, all my life everything happened in that circle around Piotrkowska, Prochnika and Wieckowskiego Streets… Eventually, the school had to be shut down by by one of its creators – the school principal Jakub Blumenfeld I remember a lot of confusion, and constant talks about whether the school would or would not be, Many of us and of our parents started considering emigration. And so, slowly, the school was becoming more and more empty There was no choice, one had to pack up and leave If you felt that you had some dignity, there was no way of staying in Poland any longer Not a month would go by without another person leaving, not a month without saying goodbye, it was becoming sad… and empty It was an expected procedure, it was just a matter of time We had to sign a form of relinquishment of Polish citizenship – I remember the guy was holding my passport and asking me “are you sure you want it this time? Are you sure you want to leave?" And I said “yes, I should have done so back in 57” My parents didn't want to leave Dad was on the floor and yelling that he wouldn't leave Poland Our parents made the decision to go in order to save us I remember my mom saying “We have the passports already, you just have to sign” “I'm not signing” I said Some people feel butterflies in the stomach but I felt as if I was choking It's as if I became an adult instantly Leaving Poland was very traumatic for me, very traumatic I felt terribly lonely, terribly embittered, that's when I cried for the first time My friends in Lodz were saying goodbye to me My father bought sausage to sell some in Israel and it was a top deal My friends from the band “Trubadurzy” were there, at the station you could say I was one of the last Jews to leave Lodz Practically only on the train, on the way to Vienna, I realized what had happened Nearly all of us left, to Israel, America, other countries Suddenly everything ends, and into the great unknown All of a sudden you leave and you must change not so much how you define yourself, because you're still a Polish Jewess from Lodz, but your identity. Your identity becomes that of an immigrant, and that is awful We saw people to the station, one after another I took many photos, possibly by the same bench, and each time there were fewer and fewer of us, because everyone left As we were at the customs in 68 they took this frame and broke it into pieces. They said it might be of value and cannot be taken out of the country. My dad told them “it's my son, can't you see…” But they broke it to see if there was maybe something inside of it I was 15 when they expelled me from country to another, it changed my entire life We were uprooted and deprived of everything, and the fact that we all manage pretty well out here, because most of us more or less manage, but that's another story It's a different thing to leave when you choose to. We were made to. Only grade tables and school registers remain from the Peretz school and they have been stored by the principal of Asnyk school, while waiting for some Peretznik to find them one day. - This is me. 8th grade – Lewkowicz Henryk: B for skipping classes, Potok – B for skipping classes, Tajchman – C – for skipping classes and lying to parents and teachers, Chmielnicki – B – for tardiness and impudence Mrs. Kwiatkowska Lewkowicz, why don't you find my good grades Impossible to find... I found my own (laugh) C+, C+ and I was beginning to think I was unfair but you had Bs in class and Ds on tests, darling, no wonder! So the year I failed I had a B in Polish class from a very stringent teacher - You see -She wasn't all that stringent, don't exaggerete - You see? He's defending me now… (laugh) "Maj jidisze mejdele, zi is azjn szejn...” LODZ, POLAND "Maj jidisze mejdele, zi is azjn szejn...” In our Jewish company there were always a few people who were not Jewish One such person was Jurek Tworkiewicz, who performed in the Jewish club together with the band Sliwki "My Jewish girl is so beautiful..." Tworkiewicz! Are you Jewish or not? That's how it was. I absolutely didn't care, but there must have been something to it, and in the club they would ask how come you stayed if everyone else left? It was kind of a coincidence, but a very lucky one that we ended up playing at the Jewish club, this young man here is me As far as so called Polishness goes, I was a representative and when I say so called I mean that as far as I can tell I'm Polish… We became well-known in Lodz and it continued till the infamous 68 when everyone started leaving all of a sudden and this terrible uproar began, a tragedy, which continues till this day for me… “We spent so much time together, at rehearsals, performances, and trips. It was a wonderful time. So many fascinating things were happening around us and each new song was a new adventure. The club was like second home for me” - that's what you wrote. - Yeah “the students got out on the streets and it came out as well This time it didn't stay under cover. Everyone could take a close look. It straightened its crooked posture…” I can't read It's been so many years I thought I could talk about it freely but... when I started reading this it all came back to me Almost everyone, all of the great great people I knew There was this song by “Skaldowie” ”the birds are restless, some fly away and some stay..” It was about the athmosphere of the time, this exodus lasted for over a year and a half First, there were those that were made to leave, almost thrown out, and then there were others. (guitar music) When Peretzniks visit Lodz, after al these years, hey often visit their old patios and backyards, where they used to spend so much time together. It may seem as if time stands still here LODZ, POLAND (softly music) - I lived here for 21 years. Whey would they expel a handful of Polish Jews in 68? Deprive them of citizenship, of their homes…? Why expel Poles – Jews born in Poland, whose parents were born in Poland, whose grandparents were born in Poland…? Those parents consciously chose to stay in Poland having survived the war? Whoever was bothered by a handful of Jews in Poland, bothered by a tiny number of Jewish schools? It's unvelievable at times just how much our lives changed When I go to Poland I'm happy to be there but at the same time I feel sorry for what happened there It's difficult form me to think of Poland or of Poles as my enemy In some way I feel it is still my home I go to Poland a lot, I love Poland When you go back you feel it is still your home We do have these strong notions of Polish nature, Polish weather I love this Polish landscape, it's positive energy here, and I guess that I feel good There continues to be a Jewish community in Lodz and generally a minyan – 10 adult Jews - can be assembled for the daily services. (singing in Polish language) NEW YORK, USA Many years have gone by since the emigration. However, they still seem to live in two different worlds: that, in which they wake everyday, but also that, which they sometimes dream about. (singing in Polish language) In Latin class Mrs. Grosman used to say 'historia magistra vitae est', i.e. history is the teacher of life. And perhaps, this story will be a teacher of life for others beside the Peretzniks… Our parents, teachers and memory of our life in Lodz. The Peretzniks
