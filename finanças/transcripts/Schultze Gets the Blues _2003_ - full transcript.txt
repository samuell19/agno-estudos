While summer is the time to come for water sports, fall is when the water is for travel... - That's enough to Start with. - Where was that again? Our twin city in America. New Braunfels, Texas. Those Yanks... For our anniversary they've invited one of us to play at their traditional festival. - Just one? Stingy. - Better than nothing. Please, gents, please. The lucky winner will be chosen by the audience at the festival. Isn't that something? I'm asking all of you to help with the festival. We've got a great poster. L'd like to ask you all to put it up. Give us one. - Can we put this up? - Yes, if you're careful. That would be Something, Schultze with the Yanks! - I'm not going. - Why not? Scared they'll send you to the chair because of your polka? They do it with injections. You've got all the time in the world. Still no. What a band - one wants to but can't, the other can but won't! Here you are. Don't look like that. You'll Soon See them queuing up down there. - Reminds me of Something. - Not that again. But l'm right, aren't I? You Prussians... You need a bit of Saxon oomph! If you cast so frantically, that Yankee rubbish won't help you at all. Gather it in, aim, and then... Cast! You know how. Where are your mates, then? OK, I won"t be like that for once.

A man of the old School. Excuse my rudeness. I haven"t introduced myself: Lorant. Schultze. Frau Schultze, what are you looking at? She can"t hear any more. She can hear but She does n"t take it in. I wouldn"t be so sure. All this upset... calls for a drop of Irish... Would you like to share a 10-year-old Bushmills? I'm not Sure. Perhaps better not. - Cheers, Schultze! To life! - To health! Schultze, it's not a Shot! You"re Supposed to sip it. You must go with me to the casino too. You have to get out, Schultz e. It"ll do you good, you"ll See. Goodbye. Goodbye. You"ve got time now. - Who have you caught there? - IS that allowed here? We"ll find it. Besides, we don"t have to walk. I'm going to make it nice and cozy here. When the terrace is ready, I can sit in the sun and drink beer. Isn't this facing north? Rubbish. It's nice here. - That"S idiotic. Think about it. - No. That's a bad trade. I give up a pawn, you lose a... - Counter it first. - Fine. - I don"t believe it. - Come on, hurry up. - No! - Yes! No. I'll take it back. - Are you crazy? - Just carry on. - The rule is, touch it, move it. - Yes, I know. Are you Korchnoi or what? I'll put it back! Hit the clock or we"ll forget the time. - No, twice. - I don"t believe it! Take it back. I'll Say it again: - Touch it, move it. That's the rule. - You and your rules. I'll put it back! I don"t believe it. - Now we can go on. - No, we can"t. It's not the Wild West here! Wild West? I'll show you Wild West! Load of rubbish! I'm Surrounded by idiots. Traffic news. There is no news. Welcome to our "Report at Night". In part two we talk about health problems from working underground. Specifically, lung cancer. Workers inhaling diesel fumes from heavy machinery... My dear Schultze, a change in musical taste isn"t an illness! I'm no psychologist, but it's definitely not life-threatening, not playing a polka for once. Quite the reverse! But Seriously... Be happy Something's happening in your life. Right now you have all the time in the world. Think of it as a gift. If you say so, Doctor... In my youth I wanted to be, just to give you an example, an opera singer. Il grande opera! Just once... to play Cavaradossi. That was nice. Wonderful. Don"t look like that, Schultze. Don"t let them get you down. They haven"t got a clue. They"re old. OK, but it's the Same at the club. You must go to the casino with me. Strengthen your nerves. Once you"ve really blown some cash, you"ll see things in a different light. What have you got to lose, Schultze? Come on, have a drink. I take it you"ll be playing your traditional polka. Of course he's playing his polka, in memory of his old man. Gentlemen, a little respect, please. We ought to call it the "Schultze Polka". Perhaps he's got something new? What? techno? Hey, Schultze. Yes, I'll play the polka. Green pepper, a hundred grams of smoked ham, 150 grams of spicy smoked sausage and finally, half a pound of prawns. Now you can go and get the ingredients. In an hour we'll cook the jambalaya together. In the meantime, music from the Deep South of the USA. Don't forget to stir. Next add the garlic, stir a little and put the lid on. Lower the heat and leave it to simmer for ten minutes. I said, leave it to simmer! Yes, it's thirsty work. Either you make up again or... I can always eat alone. What is it, then? An American dish. From the South. With all the trimmings. - Hot? - Hot. Are we jawing or eating? - Prussian Swine. - Saxon arse. Enjoy. - American. - Wow! For medicinal purposes. - Can you believe it? - What? - This. - What do you mean? - This here. - What here? Us Sitting together round here. We"ve worked together, fished together, had a drink and gone back to work till they chucked us out. Now, for the first time, we"re eating at Schultze's. Isn"t that strange? Don"t get sentimental. They"ve cheated us. We need a new revolution. Aren"t we too old for that? You"re never too old for revolution. What are you wearing? You gave me a proper fright. We wanted to... Frau Lorant? Died this afternoon. Took us by surprise. She was so full of life. But that's how it is, nothing you can do about it. Place your bets. - What shall we put it on? - Careful. No half measures. - Black or red? - Red. It had better work... - The lot? - The lot. Twenty-eight, black. Fifty years, ladies and gentlemen... ...is, as we all know, quite a long time. Ladies and gentlemen, fifty years ago... ...which is a long time ago, fifty long years... If it's all right, I'd like to play a different Song. A different song? Not the traditional polka? I don"t know what your father would say. Well, if you think so... What's it going to be? I don"t know the title exactly. Something American. American. That too! And we"re a music club. I thought it would make a change. OK? - All right, then. - Let's have a beer. - Barman... - What barman? Take your time. - What's that? - What's that? Can't you see? We just thought as no one else ever... - Would the gentlemen like to order? - Beer. Three beers? - That's awful. - Gets on your nerves, doesn"t it? Dreadful. Ole! - Everything all right, gents? - Gents? Well, you haven"t introduced yourselves. I'll do that now. This is Manfred, that's Schultz e, and I'm... J?rgen. What's your name, may I ask? You may - Lisa. - Is there a problem? - No, no. Lisa... - Smart hat. - Suits you better than Schultze. - Are you here all the time now? - Here? No, just for this dumb festival. Dumb festival? Schultze's playing. - What does Mr. Schultze play, then? - Accordion. Ship's piano? - What do you do normally? - Don"t be nosy. I'm just interested in people. - Nice, isn't it? - What? - Mu Sic. - Nice. That's where l"m going. - Where? - There. Ole! HARMONY MUSIC CLUB Here's to Schultze!

To Schultze. ...copied from our model which we've sold in great numbers. Here's our original and here's the Polish copy. A 1,000 copies have been confiscated. Today they are getting their legal comeuppance/ Customs officers chucking garden gnomes in the name of law and order. For me, personally, it's a change from the daily routine. Then comes the final, grim trip to the shredder. "At-cha... "At-cha-fa... la-ya." AUTUMN IN LOUISIANA What are you doing? You can"t do that. Why are you doing that?

Lord, teach us to understand that we all have to die Sometime, that we may become wiser in our lives. Amen.
