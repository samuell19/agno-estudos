♪ ♪ Jimmy ♪ JimmyBS ♪ JimmyBSoD ♪ JimmyBSoD ♪ So, what did you want to talk about? China wanted me to talk to you about something. Okay. She wants to come and live with me for the rest of her senior year. She said that? Yes. And she wanted me to tell you. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Look, I don't know why it is. And I don't think it has anything to do with you. - So... - I know it doesn't. I know it doesn't have anything to do with me. No, it doesn't, so, good that you know that. This is just all kinds of bullshit. Whoa, Aura. Of course, she wants to come live with you. You have a giant fucking apartment. I live in a shithole. And you have the Hamptons and the plane. Well, none of that is my fault. You divorced me while I was a loser, so you lost. Oh, shit. Wow. I take that back. Yeah, you're just gonna say that to me? - I take it back. - You can't take it back and neither can she. Can we get the check? Great, Edward. That's great. Well, I'm really glad that you like it. No, I'm excited too. I'm excited too. I am excited. Okay, well, this is great. We'll start staffing up next week. Okay. Okay. Thank you, Edward. Thank you very much. They picked it up? Twelve episodes. What the fuck, dude? You're a fucking machine, man! What the fuck? Wow! That's- don't shrug, come on, fuck you. This is amazing, man. Y-you got a show on the air. You got another one coming. Fuck you, dude. I mean, it's like you can make shit, right? You can literally like, you could hand in shit to these guys. You know what I mean, give 'em a big pile of shit, they'd be like, "that looks good, let's put it on the air." I guess. I-I-ff-I mean, you guess? these guys fucking love you, man. How do you even know your shows are even any good? What, you think they're not good anymore? You think I'm making bad shows now? No, what do I know? Good, bad. I'm just fucking proud of you, man. Well, thank you. I'm pretty happy. And seriously, fuck you. 'Cause when you think about it, fuck you, dude. It's out of control! You're unbelievable, man. Hi, Daddy. Hi! - Hey, China. - Hi, Ralph. - How are you? - I'm good. Hi, honey. So, you're uh, you're back? Oh, no, I'm still in Florida. Nice. When did you-when'd you get back? Uh, this morning. Oh, this is...I came home today so I can pick you up at the airport tomorrow. Well, you don't have to now. Did you have a good time? Yeah. Good. Okay. Well, I'm gonna go to my room, Daddy. I love you. I love you. What's wrong? I don't... she never tells me anything anymore. Well, she was just on spring break. So, what does that mean? Well, she's sparing you. You don't wanna hear about that. Spring break? You know what goes on down there? Yeah, I know the basic idea, but China's not like that. Oh, man, I know this one guy who was in Fort Lauderdale last year. And he had all these spring breakers in his hotel. And let me tell ya, they had some fucked up shit going on. No, I-I've heard about it. I know about that stuff. They got this one thing, man, where like 50 guys all jack off into a beer. And then if a girl drinks the whole beer, she gets to blow all the guys who came in it. - Jesus Christ, Ralph. - I-I know, right? And there's another one called um... oh, it's called "Mother, may I?" Where one girl, and it's usually the ugliest chick. you know, she plays "mother". And all the guys will line up naked, and the girls will line up naked. And the guys'll be like, "Mother, may I fuck this chick?" And she'll be like, "Yes, you may, yes, you may. "But only if you lick this guy's asshole." Or whatever, so you gotta do the gross thing. And then you get to do the um... the good thing, I guess. It's called, "Mother, may I?" I get it, Ralph, I get it. What I'm saying is that, that's not like China. She's not like that. She's not a "spring breaker." No, no, you're right. No, I'm sure she's th-th-the one hot girl in a bikini who- who went to spring break and spent the whole time at the library. Okay, okay. - Ralph. Ralph! - I'll see ya, buddy. Hi, hun. Hi, Daddy. How are you? Oh, thanks for asking. I'm really good, actually. Ah, they picked up my show. Huh! They did? Mm-hmm. Dad, that's so great! What show? The one about the nurses? Oh. Did you have a good time? - In Florida? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. - Good. Good. Hey, Daddy, could I go back there next week? Back to Florida? Yeah. I mean, I just wanna see some people that I met there. You mean Florida people? Yeah. What about school? I mean, Daddy, it's senior year. After spring break, you don't even do anything so, who cares? I don't know. It's okay. It's okay if you say no. I just... Not a big deal. Well, I don't wanna just say no, I'm just trying to vet the situation. Daddy, it's really okay. It's not a big deal. I just... thought about it. Well, if you-if you wanna go... Could I take the jet? The jet? Yeah, just so I don't have to go to the airport and deal with the whole security thing. - And the line, they're so long, Dad. - I don't-try to understand, I don't own a jet. I have a card where I have time on a jet. Okay, what about when you just take off for the day somewhere? Seems to me like you can use it whenever you want to. Okay, will you-look, we can talk about that, okay? - Okay. Okay. - We'll talk about it. Also, like I said, it really is not a big deal if you say no. I just would love to go. And if I'm allowed to go, I would much rather go on the jet. Got it. - Okay, I love you. - I love you. - Hey, China. - Yeah? Have you, uh, have you thought at all about what you're gonna do? With your life? I don't know, Daddy. Okay, w-w-we'll talk about it, okay? Yeah. Hi. Hey, can you look into uh, availability on a jet for next week? Just find out if there's any days it's not being used. Yes, no, for me, I mean... Yeah, just... okay? Yeah, thanks. Yeah? The fat one is here. Oh, okay. Should I let her in? Oh, I guess she's here, so... Yes, sir, I already let her in. Yup, thanks, Albert. Hey, Maggie. Glen. What is up? - Nothin' - Awesome. Maggie? Hi, baby! Maggie! Oh, my God! Look at you. You got so fucking tan. Fuck off! Baby! It's March in New York and you look like a schwoogie came all over you. - Oh. - Maggie. What's a schwoogie? It's Jewish for nigger. No, it's not! - Yes, it is. - Maggie. But not in a bad way. Wait, Maggie, I miss you. - I miss you so much. - I miss you, I miss you too. - Sweetheart. - Why don't I ever see you anymore? Well, that's your stupid dad's fault for breaking up with me. Ugh! I did not break up with you. No, no, you totally married me. Totally. Chine, go put on some clothes, I'm gonna take you to lunch. And then we're gonna go buy some stuff with your dad's credit card. Okay. I can go like this though. No, honey. I don't wanna get poked in the face by every boner in New York. Go throw on a burqa or something. Okay, Maggie. Oh, Daddy, is it okay if I go out with Maggie? I didn't know if you wanted to make plans. - No, it's fine. - Okay, I love you. - I love you too. - Oh! Daddy, also, I wanna go to Brooklyn tonight. Would you mind booking me a car? It's fine. Sure. Okay, I love you. I love you too. What? Nothing. You're a bad father. What? If your 17-year-old daughter says, "I love you" all the time, that means you're doing something wrong. Why? Because, Glen, she's seventeen. It's a complicated age. A girl that age is getting into trouble. And if she "loves" her "daddy", that means you're doing nothing. You know something, Maggie? I appreciate you staying in her life since we-we broke up. She loves you very much but you're not her mom. And you're not my wife. So... let's maybe have some boundaries, okay? Oh, God. Did you just say all of that? Ugh, yes. Yecch. God. Jesus, Glen. You suck so bad. Seriously, man! You suck. Look at you. "Oh... "Er... I appreciate you staying in her life but let's have a boundary", Oooh! Fuck you, Glen. That's my China. Her mother's retarded, and her father's a douche, but she's got me. And I don't need your permission or "thanks for staying in her life". China and I are bros. And you can shove your boundaries up your back puss hole. - Seriously. - I-okay. I got it. I'm ready. Chine, who do you love more? Me or your dad? You, obviously. Goodbye, Daddy. I love you. - Where do you wanna go? - Cipriani's. Oh. Oh-ho-ho! Oh, my-oh, what the fuck? What the fuck?! What? Hang on, I'm sending this to you. Okay. Oh. Oh, there's an ad. You gotta watch the ad. Okay. - Oh! Oh, Jesus! - Ah! What the hell?! What the hell? What the fuck? Oh! Did you tell the network they could have that show for the fall? They-they wanted it for the fall. The fall, Glen? H-h-how are we gonna get the show staffed, and cast, and shot, and cut in time to air in September, when you haven't fucking written it yet? I'll get-I'll get it written. Get it written? Glen, it's April. W-why did you put us in this position? Because that's what they had open. They had a slot in the fall, and so I grabbed it. So we have another show on the air. Isn't that what we want? To stay working, to say on television? They want the show for the fall. If we can't do it, th-they push us to mid-season. But don't you see what this does to the company, Glen? What this does to me? 'Cause I like to try to do the things that we say we're gonna do. Yes, Paula, and you do. You do it every time. That's why you're a rock star, and that's why you're my partner. No, no, Glen, I'm not a rock star. I just work. And I never complain. Right? You tell me you need a horse dangling from a helicopter over the ocean. I don't ask you what you need it for. I just go out and I fucking do it. I-I go out and I find a- a pilot and an aircraft. I find a-a slimy animal handler who is willing to dangle this fucking horse off a helicopter over the ocean. An experience from which the animal will never recover, by the way. And we r-rig them out on a barge and we go out and we fucking shoot it. Because you told me it was "essential to the storyline." Jesus, I never saw that. What show is that for? No, no, you didn't, 'cause he cut it. And no one will ever be able to explain to that fucking horse why it had that experience. Well, we gave $10,000 to PETA. Great. The horse will never see that money. I don't think horses remember, do they? Look, Gle-, I-I would die for you, Glen. You know that. I-I-I'm sworn to do that like a s-fucking knight in armor. I know. But when you pull bullshit like this, w-w-when you turn my own ability against me, w-when you promise things to people I-I can't do, w-when y-you set me up to fuckin' fail so you could hold on to a time slot for a show that you h-haven't even written yet about nurses, Glen? Glen, w-why are we doing a show about nurses? What the fuck do you know about a nurse? Or anybody who works hard and gives a shit about their job? Hmm?! Paula... What do you want me to say? I mean, I'm sorry. If you wanna farm it out, we can farm it out, you wanna... We'll hire somebody else to produce it. Fuck you, Glen. That's bullshit. I'll fucking do it. But I'll tell you what, you better be ready. You better shit out twelve episodes. We have 'em. - What's that? - We already did the pilot. Because I'm telling you what. That show is gonna be on the air in September. Because I do what I say I'm gonna do. Even if it was you that said I was gonna do it. But I tell you, if you ever promise a show on a timeline again without talking to me first, I would fucking quit. Okay, so... I mean, good. So, we're gonna do it. I-I, y-you had me worried you weren't gonna do it when you came in here. So, we're good. Right? I mean... Paula, I'm sorry. Come on. I'm really sorry. She seems upset. Ah, she'll be all right. Hey, what show is the horse over the ocean thing for? Doesn't matter. - Hi, honey! - Hi, Daddy! Hey, how are you? You having a good time? Yeah, um... Hey, Daddy, is it okay if I stay here a few more days? Oh, honey, you're missin' a lot of school. Daddy, i-it's senior year, it doesn't matter. I know that you said that, but I don't know, China. Why don't you just come home? Um... hold on... Daddy, listen, um... this is really good for me. I really need this right now. But if you have to say no, it's okay. I-I totally understand. No, I mean, just, let's-let me let me think about it - and then we'll talk later, okay? - Okay. - I love you. - I love you, too. - Okay. Bye, Daddy. - Bye. Hey, uh... didn't China just come home from spring break? Yeah. She went back to Florida this week. S-so you let her go back. She... Yes, I let her. And-and now, she uh, she wants to stay a little bit longer? Yeah. So, do you ever say no to her? I didn't just, I didn't just say yes to her. Well, you didn't just say no, either, now did ya? ♪ Mother, may I Oh, mother, may I ♪ ♪ Mother, may I suck a dick? ♪ Yeah? Dick Welker's on the phone. Okay. - Glen? - Hi, Dick. Hey, I heard your nurses show got picked up. That's a fucking boner! Uh, yeah, we're pretty excited. No, it's all good, and I'm gonna make your day perfect. I've got your lead. No, the lead is cast, Dick. That's not what I heard. What did you- what did you hear? I heard they hate Jordana, and I heard you hate her and you need a lead, so I got your lead. Grace Cullen is your lead. Huh! Grace Cullen? Oh! Grace Cullen? Why would she wanna pee on this show? She loves your work! Anyway, she's on her way to your office now. Just meet her, she wants to talk. How do I...Grace Cullen? I didn't have an appointment to meet her. What do you... appointments. What are you, Secretary of Defense? Just meet her. Meet her. Grace Cullen is here? - She's here! - She's here? Jesus Christ, Dick! - What do you want me to do? - She's there. I can't-t insult Grace Cullen, let her in. Oh, let her in! Let her in! - Go ahead, let her in. - Oh! - You'll love her! - Yeah, fuck you, Dick. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, God. Ralph. - Hmm? - Do me a favor, huh? - Yeah, I'll take a walk. - I don't care. All right, I'm out. - Hey, oh! - Hi! Oh, my God! Nice to meet you, I'm Grace Cullen. Oh, yeah, of course, come on! Hi, how are you? I'm really good, yeah, Ralph, you know. - Hi! - I'm leavin'. Oh, okay, well, you're hilarious. Oh, thanks so much! Yeah, yeah. - Whoa! - Ah! - Hi, Grace, I'm-I'm Glen. - I know, hi. Um, do you want to sit down? - Thank you. - Sure. So... Can I just tell you something? We've actually met before. - We have? - Mm-hmm. I auditioned for you. On "Two Peanuts." - You did? - I did. I was a... just a... newborn. Is that the word? I was uh, 25 and uh, I did a horrible job. - And I wanted to kill myself - Oh. - after I read for you. - Aw. Well... I don't know, I'm a-I'm a huge fan of your writing. Wow, wow, I mean, you know, look at you, though. You're doing great. Three huge movies in a row, and you know. And you're really good. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Well, thank you, I... - Yeah. - I really hope to keep working. - Sure. Sure. Is that your girlfriend? Oh, God, no. That's my daughter, China. Oh, wow, she's gorgeous. Is she an actress? Uh, no. No. She's lovely. Thank you. I mean on her behalf. Sure. - So you, y-you're, you have a... - Yes, that's right. Five months. - Five months, wow. - Mm-hmm. I didn't even know... I didn't-I never heard that you were married. I'm not. - You're not? - Mnh-mnh. Oh, so, you're just doin' it. Yes, eh...that's right. I'm just doing it. Good. That's good. I mean, it's, I don't, it doesn't matter what I say. It's your life, your baby. Do you have any other kids? No, just the one. So. You know, I think most people when they have one kid it's 'cause they didn't- they realize they shouldn't have. I mean, I love her and she's the best. But her mom and I never... we didn't really... that-that's I mean, this doesn't, you didn't-you didn't, um... It's okay. Well, I'm sure, I'm sure you're a great dad. Okay. - So... - So, um... - Can I be honest with you, Grace? - Oh, please. Listen, um, this show is very new and we just... We've done a pilot, we're going into series now but we haven't really started casting yet and well, you know Dick. - Yes, I know Dick. - Well, so, uh... He sent you over here and then told me. And you know, I mean the stupid thing is I couldn't give you this part right now if I wanted to. 'Cause it wouldn't be fair to Jordana. Jordana Newsom? Yes, she did the pilot. Oh, no. And you're firing her? I mean, I don't know, it's, that... It's early yet and you know, when the show starts, the the sharks start to circle, you know? Am I a shark? God, no! Dick is a shark. You're-you're not a shark, You're-you're-you're-you're great. Oh, no, I... I should go. - I mean, I-I should leave. - No, no... - No. - No, no, I should. I should. I-I-I feel dreadful. Y-you, shit, you know what, yeah. We shouldn't... - We shouldn't be doing this. - No. No, this shouldn't be happening right now. So, let's get you out of here. Well, but-but I really appreciate your honesty. - It's very rare. - Oh, sure, sure. Let me give you my number. Sure. I'm just gonna give you my number... And if uh, you know, you wanna consider me for something... Please don't call Dick, okay? Just call me. Okay. I'd really love to work with you. I promise you, I would do a good job. Oh, Grace, you don't have to say that. You're a superstar. No, but I've never done comedy. And I honestly think that that's what I'd be best at. I'd love to show you that I'm funny. I'd really, really love to work with you. More than you know. Okay. Thanks, Glen.

Oh, no, no, don't change it. I love this movie. Ack. Grace Cullen. She is so beautiful. I met her last week. W-what? What? You actually met Grace Cullen? You never care when I tell you I met famous people. Yeah, but Grace is a badass. Yeah, she is pretty great. Yeah. Why'd you meet her? Uh, 'cause of my new show. Are you gonna cast her? Maybe. Don't know. Jesus. What kind of movie is this? Wha-you never saw? I thought it was like a romcom, and now it's a horror movie. It's not a horror movie, it's about... female empowerment. It's empowering for a woman to show a guy her tits and then slit his throat? Would you rather he raped her? I wish there was one other option. Daddy, this whole movie is about fucking men. Men have fucked us for long enough, so it's time for us to fuck back. You know, t-t-to claim the world and finally be in the power position. It's feminism. - What? - Noth-nothing. What are you laughin' at? Nothing, it's just... ahem... it's-it's kind of funny coming from you. Why? Well, never mind, never mind. No, why? Your life is not exactly a great platform for feminism. Dad. Well, I mean, you don't- you don't even read about that stuff like your friend Zasha does. And... honey, I'm sorry, but you can't like lay in a bikini in your dad's high-rise apartment and go to Florida twice in a month and then watch one reverse horror-porn movie and then start sayin' you're a feminist. Feminism i-is about taking care of yourself. It's about being independent, and... being on your own. Look, if you're gonna compete with men... yeah, your strength has to come from your own abilities and your and your own victories. Not-not from r-rejecting and hating men. Uh, from a, from a lounge on the deck. But I don't choose to live this way. Daddy, I, I'm-I'm here because of you. Well, I think Gloria Steinem would tell you to get a waitressing job. You know, read. It's-it's up to you, it's not up to me. You know, China... you didn't even fill out one college application yet. You told me that I could take a gap year. So, what are you gonna do with your gap year? Are you gonna go-go back to Florida, and play "Mother, may I?" Oh. Okay. Ah. Hello? Hi, Grace. This is uh, this is Glen... Topher. Glen. Is this weird that I'm calling? Yes. Maybe this is bad because you gave me your number for professional... Oh, this is not a professional call? No, I-I-I'm just uh... Oh, no, it's okay. It's really nice to hear from you. Personally. Okay. Good. How are you? I'm all right. I saw a piece of your movie. Which one? Uh, Haven? Oh, right. Is that why you're calling? 'Cause you saw me with my shirt off? No, no, no, no. I'm teasing. Actually, I got um, got in a fight with my daughter because of your 'cause of your movie. Really? Yeah, she's a- she's a big fan of yours. And sh-now she's-and now she's mad at you because of my movie? Yeah, I guess I was uh, I was mansplaining or whatever. Okay, so, here's what you're gonna do to fix it: Bring her to my party this weekend. A party? Yeah, I'm having a party at my house in the Hamptons this Sunday. It's gonna be ridiculous. I'm hosting it for a friend of mine. Every young famous person your daughter's ever heard of will be there. Everybody she loves and everybody she hates. You'll find it very tedious but that's your penance. Bring her here, and I promise you she'll love you again. Oh, my God. - Daddy, this house is so cool. - Hmm. This is fucking retarded. This is the most retarded fucking day of my life. Yeah, me too. That's like, what? Daddy, do you see who all's here? Yes, it's all very... Oh, wow, there's Grace. - Yup, that's Grace. - She's so pretty. - Oh, my God. - What? That's Leslie Goodwin. I've been wanting to meet him my whole life. Ew. Isn't he a child molester? - Allegedly. - That's just a rumor. - Dad, he's a child molester. - You don't know that, China. It's-that's just a story. Ugh, God, he's gross. Yeah, but he's sexy. Zash, come on. You know, China, you shouldn't say things like that about a person that you don't know who you just heard rumors about. Okay, well, he also dates really young women. And he's what, like 80 years old? He's a great artist. Probably the best writer, film maker in the last 30 years or more. Now his private life is, that's not anybody's business. It is, if he's molesting children. What makes you think that that's something that you know about him? - Glen! Hi! - Hi! Oh, I'm so happy that you came. - Is this? - This is China... and this is uh, my- is her friend, Zasha. Sasha or Zasha? - Whatever you want. - Oh, I love Zasha. - And you're China! Hi. - Yes, hi. - It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you, too. Your dad's a genius, China. - Oh, uh, sometimes, I guess. - Please. It's true! I'm sure this is annoying because he's your father, but honestly... Oh, Les, Leslie, come here. - Hi. - Mwah. Leslie Goodwin, this is Glen, China and Zasha. Hi. Hi, it's my manna-my-mynard to meet you. Y-your name is China? No, no, uh, my daughter, this is... Th-this, your daughter here? Yeah, I'm Glen Topher. I'm Glen Topher. Got it. Hi, I'm Leslie. Hi. Girls, would you like to meet Cameron? Cameron who? - Shut up, Dad. - Come on, ladies. Okay. She's a terrific girl. Yeah, yeah, she is. How do you know her? Oh, Grace? We go back a while. You? Oh, um, I'm-I'm-I'm writing a new- it's a new show. I-I-I write TV shows. Make TV shows. Made-I made some shows. Anyway, uh, the new show I'm working on, um, Grace might be in it. Oh, what's the show? Uh, just a thing. It's not a... To be honest with you, it's not- it's not my favorite project. It's not? No, no. But you know- you know how it goes. I never worked in television. I know. I know that. I... I-I'm a very big admirer of yours. Not to be...anyway, so this new show... um, we're going to series, which is great. Um, but it's not something I'm in love with, you know. It's just not... I don't have a feel for it. Then, why are you doing it? Right, yeah, I mean, you know. I can't imagine being in that position. Why would you do that? Did you need the money? No, no, I... I'm doing fine. My oth-my other shows have been very successful. It's just... Sure, but make a show unless you had a desire to do it or unless you're poor. Right. But you know when you get in that kind of mode after a while where you just sorta just start kinda makin' stuff just 'cause you- because you can. Yeah, I would never do that. But I'm not you. How did you come up with the name China? Oh, China, uh, her mom. That's her mother's name? She's China Jr.? No, no, her mother- her mother named her. And you just stood there. That's, yeah, that's basically it. It was really nice to, mhmm, it was very nice to meet you. Are you having a fabulous time? Yes, oh, yes. I'm glad that they're enjoying it. And uh, it's nice to see you. It's nice to see you too. It's uh, how do you know? - Leslie? - Yeah. Oh, we sort of dated when I was younger. - Really? - Hmm. I've...I've always wanted to be that guy. - He's pretty impressive. - Yup. I just-I never-I wouldn't expect to see him at-at this kind of-this kind of party. Oh, he likes me throwing these parties so he can scam on all the young girls. Really? He loves it. He's an old perv. So, are you an intersectional feminist? A radical feminist? Uh, I don't know. It's kinda just something I started thinking about. Well, that's the best way. If it starts with your own feelings. Then you reach out into the world, find out who else thinks the way you do. That's how those movements form. What... you know, is exactly is a radical feminist? So, your average, garden-variety feminist... not that they like to be called that... So, but your basic feminist wants women to succeed on an equal basis within the existing system, but your radical feminist says, "Let's throw out the patriarchy destroy the whole system, start from scratch." And they-they have a point because the patriarchy uh, has a pretty awful track record. Hitler or Genghis Khan, Donald Trump. These are some of the great products of the patriarchy. Okay, but uh... so they think women would do better? Yeah, that's the question, isn't it? I mean, humans are human. I don't think gender makes so much difference. If this had been a matriarchal history, then you'd have Jane Hitler, and... maybe... Doris Khan. Somehow still Donald Trump, I think. Personally, I think it's just busywork. All these different groups of people trying to figure out uh, how could we solve everything? What's the key to making humanity work? Where really, civilization, no matter how you slice it, uh it is a necessary, messy complex of barely coherent disaster of people loving and hating each other, murdering and kissing each other, telling stories and lies, buying and stealing from each other. There is no solution. And, uh, I wouldn't have it any other way. The great poetry comes from our flaws. But that's just me. What do you think? Me? Um... I don't know. You know what? Th-that's really the only honest answer, so, good for you. Do you have-do you have plans for your life? Are you gonna go to college? Um... You know, I don't know. I-I don't really know what to do. I know that sounds really lame, right? - No. No. - Don't say it out loud. It sounds wonderful. It's exciting. Exciting? Yes, because once you decide what to do, then you're gonna be faced with hard work and confusion and disappointment. Right now, all you have is potential. You can literally do anything you want. Until you decide what to do, at which point, you'll only be able to either fail or succeed at that choice. Wow. You make it sound a lot better than it seems. I kinda wish I had some sort of direction. Yeah, well, you know, don't be in such a hurry. Take this from a director. Direction is overrated. Rudderless is a wonderful, underrated lifestyle choice. Who needs a rudder? - Uh... - I feel-I feel um... I feel really weird talking to you. Why? Because my Dad... he worships you. He literally spends his entire career trying to be just like you. And I don't like you. You don't like me? I'm crushed. I thought I was making a terrific impression. Is it my teeth? Do I smell? I mean, it's... it's what I've heard about you. What you've heard about me? Yeah. You know, about... Okay, well, look, I haven't heard anything about you, for instance. I can only go by what I see in front of me. In meeting you, um, in my experience, that's the best thing to go by. And as far as I can see, you seem like a boorish and rude person with no boundaries. In other words, I think you're terrific. And if I read something terrible about you later, I won't believe it. I don't know. Well, that's the only honest response. Yeah, oh, my God. You're having lunch with - Leslie Goodwin? - Yeah, yeah. - Out of control! - That's actually happening tomorrow. I-they-his office called to set it up after I met him at that party. Uh-huh. And he wants to come and talk to me at lunch about writing and TV. - Movies and? Oh, my God! - Yeah. A-and you gotta ask him if he touched that kid. Wha-what? I bet no one's ever just come right out and asked him. Like just go, "Hey, hey, man, "did you really do like, you know, sex stuff with the kid?" This is a huge opportunity, Glen. I'm not gonna ask him that, Ralph. Jesus. It's-that's a rumor. Yeah. But then, you know, if he's he'll just deny it and you change the subject. It's no big deal. I could maybe work with the best writer-director like, ever and you want me to ask him about a fucked up unproven story. He was never even charged with that. I'm just saying, if you don't ask him, you're being a great big pussy, man. You're crazy. Grace Cullen on line 2. This is the best day ever. You're having the best day ever. Ah, speaker phone, please. Speaker phone? Speaker? Speaker? Speaker phone. Speaker phone. Put it on speaker phone. Speaker phone. Spe-spe-spe-spe-spe-spe-spe-spe Hi! Hi! Oh. Hey, I've been meaning to call you every day. I've been working so much. I just wanted to say thank you so much for coming to my party last week. And for bringing China. She's adorable. That's really nice. No, you... Thank you for having us. How's it going with the writing? You know what? I wanted to talk to you about that. Glen, I want you to know I'm not trying to steal that part. I'm really not. I just looking in on you. It's not about me. Listen, Grace. I've been unable to write this show because I don't know who these people are. I feel like in my mind if it's you... I'll be able to get there. Wow. Jeez. Glen. You did tell me that if I ever wanted to work with you that I should talk to you about it. I did. I did say that. Okay, so, what do you say? You wanna play this part? Glen, I'm dying to work with you. Yes. Great. Great. Um, listen, I'm gonna get off the phone because this is good. Okay? Okay. Okay. Um, bye Grace. I'm excited. Bye. Dude. You are the master. You are the master, man. Here I am, I'm telling you, and you just showed me. - Oh, wow. - No, no, no, no Don't deny it, I mean. I feel like I just saw your dick go inside her. Hey, that's-that's gross. She's pregnant. Well, yeah, she's gross now. But as soon as she gets the baby out, hey, man, you're gonna be the only one gettin' in there. Right? So that's the genius of it. - That is the genius of it! - No, no, no, no. Now, Ralph, I didn't- - I'm not trying to fuck her. - Ho-ho-ho-ho. I just cast her in my show. Oh, think about how much money and pussy you are getting from the show that doesn't even exist. All right, stop. Seriously. Glen. We need to go over the schedule. I'm just making dates based on uh, cast availability, since I have no scripts or outlines or locations or anything, so I'm just making, you know, basic production schedule based on talking to the reps. Trying to make the days with the actors, so... You're gonna have to make some changes. I-make some changes? Like, what ch-what changes? I'm replacing Jordana. Replacing Jor-I just got off the phone with her. We're... with whom? With Grace Cullen. Grace Cullen, the pregnant lady? Yeah. - She's pregnant. - Okay. Well, so, the character can be pregnant, Paula. But then she will have a baby. I mean, you know that's how pregnancy ends, right? - A person then has a baby. - Yeah, not always. - Sometimes you get an abortion. - Not always. Not always because... I mean I doubt you can talk her into an abortion. - But I'm just saying it's a good idea. - Dear God. So, then the rest of the series, this person's going to have a baby. Yes? - The rest of the series? - That's right, I'm gonna make it work. It's gonna be okay. She's a big movie star! Okay, so then you-this is-you- this is done? Yes, I-I hired Grace. You hired Grace, so then I have to fire Jordana. Yes. It's a clear upgrade to me. Shut up, Ralph. So, you-you were gonna make me um, fire Jordana and redo the sch-well, actually, just scrap the schedule. 'Cause we have nothing now. Yes? I'm sorry, that's what's called for. - Okay, called for by? - Me. Ooh, the man takes charge. Shut up, Ralph. Glen, what are we doing? You know, what is it that we do here? Like what... what is this company even anymore? Same as always. We're doing the same thing we always did, Paula. Okay, so this is our artistic imperative, right? You are firing your lead actress and hiring a pregnant movie star because clearly, she's the only person on the planet who could possibly play this role in this show that is very important to you. Right? We're-we're working hard and and we're-we're doing unpleasant things because we're making art. Yes? Paula, take it easy. I have Leslie Goodwin's office on 1. Thank you. Oh! Speaker, speaker, speaker, speaker, speaker. Hello? Oh. Okay, sure. I understand. Thank you. Yeah. They just canceled my lunch with Leslie. - Aw, bummer! - Yeah. I'm sorry, Glen. I knew you were looking forward to that. Ah, It's a bummer. I'm just gonna go fire that woman now. - Hi, Daddy. - Hi! - Hi, Paula. - Hi, honey. How are you? - Hi, Daddy. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Good. - Hi, Ralph. - Hey, China. - What's all this, then? - Oh, I was just in the neighborhood. And I miss you, and I wanted to come say hi. And that I love you. Well, you're cheerin' me up! - Why, what's wrong? - Ah, nothin'. Oh, your dad was supposed to have lunch with the great, Leslie Goodwin, but his office called and canceled, so he's sad. Oh, well, he's going to Europe tonight. For some movie he's starting in the summer. Oh, what did he say? He said... Oh, that he needed to go get some "Italian money." Yeah. Why-why do you know that, China? Oh, well, I was just with him. You were... You were with Leslie Goodwin? Yeah. God, isn't that weird? Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's weird. Well, it's not that weird. He likes young girls. Oh, yes, he does. Why were you with Leslie Goodwin? Oh, I was shopping for shorts at Barney's and, well, there he was. - By himself? - Mm-hmm. What was Leslie Goodwin doing by himself in the women's department at Barney's? Oh, um... Well, he goes there to... Get this: To look at young girls. He said that. I said, "What are you doing here?" And he said... Oh, I actually come here quite often because this is where all of Manhattan's elite girls come and I like looking at them. You like looking at young girls? Sure, who doesn't. I mean, if you had a choice between looking at a pretty girl your age or a retired bus driver, who would you choose? Anyway, h-he's kinda gross, you know? But he's hilarious. I'm an appreciator of fine things, China. I enjoy chamber music, certain abstract sculpture, and private school Manhattan girls who shop at Barneys. And by the way, so does- so does everybody else. Look at this guy over here... staring at you. He's a pervert. Oh, my God. And you're-you're not a pervert, then? Sure, I'm a pervert, but at least I'm talking to you like a normal human being instead of leering at you like you're a roast chicken. I'm interested in the whole person. It's not just about your perfect body. It's about where you are in this journey of life and humanity. Really? Yes. This time in life that you're living, China, will never come again. It's not just your age, it's your age at this moment in history in this country, in this town, in this particular department in Barney's. The who you are, the where you are, the when you are, I appreciate all of that. Yeah, I'm very aware that you "appreciate" young girls, but you don't listen. You're doing all the talking. You know what? You're right. That's absolutely fair. That's correct. And I realize that that comment is meant to shame me into shutting up. But you know what, I'm gonna keep talking. Because people your age tend to think in short bursts. Because you've experienced less time. You haven't yet understood how very, very long this conversation is. - Oh, really? - Yes. And I'm only, in fact, in the first stanza of the first paragraph. And when it's your turn, you're going to have to go on as long. - Oh, well, I-I... - Oh, wait, no, no. Still my turn. Oh, here, we have the standard. Never dies. The gold bikini should come with a vial of cocaine. God, I wouldn't be caught dead in that thing. Hmm, if you were, you wouldn't be the first. Hmm. Now this one is actually pretty cute. Yeah, that's something. You should try it on. You didn't try it on though, did you? I think maybe she did? Well, sure, I did. Now, that is a perfect outfit. I call that "The Brat with No Goals". You wear that to the pool where you treat everyone like crap until your father hires a pool boy from El Salvador who teaches you how to hallucinate by licking certain toads. He had a character and a story for every outfit. Now, this is what you were wearing when you were abducted by Russian slave traders. And it looked terrific at first but by the time you get to Minsk it was all dirty because you've been duct taped for a week. I don't know, it was fun. Oh. That guy is the master. He is the master. And then, we went to the park. We started listening to this guitar player. But there was this saxophone player. Well, you couldn't hear either of them 'cause they were just drowning each other out. So Leslie convinces the guitar player to come over and play with the saxophone player. And still no one really wanted to listen, so... Leslie goes to this ice cream vendor and he starts buying ice creams and just handing them out to people to- to attract a crowd. God, it was just... It was the best fucking time that I have had in... in years. China! What? Well... What happened then? Um... Nothing. 'Cause he had to go and so he left and I came to see you. So, Daddy, do you wanna go get some dinner? Or do you guys wanna go home? I'm kinda hungry. It's so beautiful. Well, yeah, sure. What does that mean? Well, I mean, we're rich and we're on a private beach. Of course, it's beautiful. You mean the world is ugly if you don't have money? Yeah. Well, I can't wait to read what you've been writing. Yeah, no, I'll get- I'll give you something really soon. I really like uh... I like being around you. Yeah, me too. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's so funny when you're miserable. Uh-huh. It's very funny. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Oh, Leslie called me yesterday, he told me about Paris. What about- what about Paris? That he's taking China. I'm sorry, what? Yeah, he told me that... You're saying you didn't know? - What are you talking about? - Oh, I, I... - What are you talking about? - Shit. I thought... I thought you knew. - Uh-huh. - Shit. Sorry. China! Yeah? I'm in here, Daddy. Hi. What's up? Are you okay? Uh, I've been told that you're going to Paris? With Leslie Goodwin? Oh, yeah. I uh, I was gonna tell you about that, actually. You were gonna tell me? - Well... - When were you gonna tell me? When? When were you gonna tell me? When you get back from France? - No, Daddy. - This isn't funny. China, you're a-a minor. You can't just go to Paris with some - fucking... - Daddy. Well, you're not going. - What? - You're not going. This is-this is unbelievable. Y-y-you're not going to Paris with him. Daddy, it isn't just me going. It's a trip he puts together for a bunch of people. And he's just including me. Because they all go and they see a bunch of French theater. And I told him I'm thinking of getting into theater. And he said it'd be good for me. He said... since when? Since when? Have you been seeing him? - No, Dad. - China, look at me. Have you been seeing him?! No, Daddy, i-it's a big trip. And I am inspired about going. You told me to start thinking about my future. You're not going. I'm going. No, you're not! You're a minor! And you're seventeen! Okay, so what are you gonna do? What, you're gonna call the cops on me? Because I'm going, Daddy. This is good for me. And you're such a hypocrite, because you worship him. And you're just mad that he didn't invite you to go to Paris. Oh, my God. And that he never took you to lunch. And it's really fucked up that you would take that out on me. When this trip could be really good for me. I know, I know, it's terrible. Do you know what the real shock is though? I went back. Yeah, yeah. I did. I had to do it again. I loved it. I love to repeat the worst moments of my life. So, leave nothing on the table, gang. Misery is dessert. Chin-chin. Hi, come in. How are you? I'm just cooking. Why are you always laughin' at me? You're funny. Okay. You look at me like I'm the sky. And you've never seen it. You are the sky. You're the sky. And I've never seen it. Oh, my God, Glen. For a jaded old fucker, you sure fall hard for a pretty girl. I mean, that's all I am? No, you're a lot more than that. Not really, and I don't need to be, but thank you for trying. Shall we read the script? Um, maybe you should read it alone when I'm gone. Okay. Hey, I hope it's not a sore point, but I hear China's having a great time in France. You heard from Leslie? Well, everybody's there right now, so. Everybody. She's quite the hit. Hmm. Look, Glen. This isn't all bad for her, Leslie. Hmmm. Look, if-if I'm the sky and I'm amazing and all, then just listen to me a little bit. This is a positive thing for China and I think you're smarter than to be scared of it. Okay, look, I-I get-I get that there's a whole, you know... It's like, different if you're-if you're an intellectual, right? Or if you're a f-um, f-f... a rich artist. Then, you're above all that, I guess, you know. Only poor people are pedophiles, you know, because, we... "We a-are Leslie Goodwin. "We're after a higher sense of personal stimulus and... "We're not bound by social mores and..." Whatever, but I mean he's an old fuck with a shady past and she's a kid. She's a kid? Yeah, I mean she's a minor. She's not competent to... I mean... what if they're... What if they're... you know. What if they're fucking? Oh! What if they are? What if they are?! Come on! Grace! Jesus Christ. She's not competent to give consent. Not to an old, manipulative guy like that. She's not-she doesn't have the tools to sort that out. So, you think when she turns 18 in three weeks, she's going to suddenly grow a magic tool of? No, she's not, th-that's, but doesn't mean she has it now. I mean, this particular kid, she is a child. She knows nothing. She's like a Disney princess on estrogen. She's not... She knows nothing! Well, considering that she is gonna be an adult in three weeks, she's in some trouble, then. Something better grow her up. I mean, she could do a lot worse. So, you think it's-you think- you think it's okay? An old man and a- and a girl? I mean, doesn't society have to protect her? Society? You mean you? Yes. Yes. Me. Because what? Because she's 17? I mean, come on, Glen. It-It's a number. A person isn't a number. They declare you competent to sleep with anyone you want at 18. Why 18? Huh? Because that's when you can vote? And own property, and and get your own health insurance. I mean, why would all those things happen on the same day? Why would a person sexually mature at 13, or 12 and then be expected to be put on ice for five or six years so they can vote and fuck a grown-up on the same day? I mean. Look, I know, I know. I-I know that kids have sex. I'm not stupid. But I-I-not-not with grown-ups. They have sex with other kids. Oh, great, great, so when a girl does feel lust and desire, she's gotta go be with a fucking boy. Who's full of all these new hormones and far more dangerous than a man like Leslie. I mean, if your daughter is as emotionally retarded as you're selling her, then... Look, this is-I- what do I have to say? This is wrong, this is-this is so- this is just a g- This is an old man fucking a kid. But you don't know that that's what they're doing. That's not the point. It is the point. That you don't know. You don't know Leslie. And y-you don't really know her. I don't know her- You know, Grace... You know... No offense, but you're not a mother yet. No. And you don't know what it's like. No, I really don't. You know, it's easy for you to sit there and say, you know, uh, go let your daughter fuck a corpse. Which I didn't say. But you know, whenever that- whoever that is in there, when they grow up, you're gonna be upset all the time. You have no idea. No, I don't. And you don't know me, and I don't know you. I mean, you're what? You're a divorced man. You were married and then, what happened? You cheated on her? What? Well... that's what I heard. I mean, it's not a secret, is it? You were fucking around and you got caught and then she left you. Okay, you know... Y-you heard-you can-y-you you can think what you want. I... My marriage... that... People say what they want. People think they know. I mean, we-we hurt each other. We were both in a lot of pain. You know... People think they know, and they don't... They don't know. Nobody knows. Nobody knows what happens in a marriage. Except those two people. I mean, if there's one thing I learned from that, it's just-it's never to think you know anything about somebody else. Or to think that you can judge anybody on their private life. Hmm. This is different. This is different. This is basic. This is math. He's old and she's a kid. When I was 15, I dated a man in his 50's. Was it Leslie? That's none of your fucking business, Glen. It was my life. I don't regret it. I wanted to be with who I wanted to be with. I'm sorry, Grace, but you were raped. What? I don't know who the guy was, but that was wrong. You sh-you were raped. How dare you. How fucking dare you, you know who's gross, Glen? You're gross! It's really gross how you believe you can just wave your gavel and tell women who they should be with. It's my daughter! For five more minutes. She's just living her life. Let her live it. Look, I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to go that far. - It's your family, and I'm-I'm... - Yeah, it is. Oh. Ah. - Oh. - Ah. Ooh! Aah! Oh, shit. Ah, fuck. Glen. What? Glen. What? You gotta see this. No, I don't. Ah! Yes, you do. What the... - Right? - fuck. What the fuck is goin' on down there? Well, I mean, it's pretty clear. What? Well, he's a warmer. He's-he's warmin' her up. Warming her up for what? For Leslie. So, you think that he handed her off to Raymond Ross, yeah. Someone closer to her age, more of an animal, really, I mean, that guy bangs a girl, you know. - Okay, okay, okay, okay. - Well, he's British. Look, he's British and whatnot - Right? So that's pure sex - Yeah. - I mean, look at that guy. - Ah. You know what I mean? So like, Raymond Ross, man. Well, he bangs her pretty hard. - Okay. - And then she cries Goes to the beach, you know, kicks around the sand, and cries. But then, Leslie steps in. He's kind... He's wise... And she's ready for him now. You know? She's seasoned. Just enough, but... Still fresh. What the fuck, Ralph? Where are you getting all of that? It's all in the pictures, man. Look. Look, look, look. You know, all I'm saying is that when we first met... God, Leslie, you-you did such nice things for me I mean, you-you were nice. You were a-a gentleman. And now, now it's like I'm your roommate or something. I feel like we're both guys! But you see, that's an illusion. I'm treating you exactly the same the entire time we've known each other. But girls want and expect a constant escalation - throughout a relationship. - Uh-huh. A constant increase in devotion and favors. If you treat a girl better every day, she thinks nothing is changing. If you treat her the same throughout, she thinks it's getting worse. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Leslie, why do I hang out with you? That's the only question you need to ask yourself. Hi. Oh, hi, Daddy. Hi. - Hello, Leslie. - Hello, hello. This is-this is Ralph Kinder. This is Leslie Goodwin. Oh, my God. - Hi. - Hey. - How are you? - I know you from television. - You're hysterically funny. - Oh, thanks! Yeah, look... This is an honor for me 'cause I-I've always wanted to meet you. - Is that right? - Oh, absolutely, yeah! Hey, d'you really fuck that kid like everyone says? You know, Ralph, you're the first person that'd come out and ask me that question. See? See? I-I knew that nobody had. I love this guy, he's good. Yeah, so, just tell me. Well, you know what, it's a really personal story but someday, you and I will have a drink and I will tell you all about it. Oh, shit, I would love that. That'd be fucking great. Uh, hey, man. I'm gonna roll. - Okay, Ralph. I'll see you, buddy. - Okay, man. Hey, Ralph, do you play tennis? Uh, sure. Do you wanna come to midtown someday? - So, you had a good time? - Play with me? - Yeah, yeah, I did. - Sure! How are you, Daddy? I'm okay. Good. Hey, you're the king, Leslie. I'll see you, man. A-and I will find out if you fucked that kid. I feel like you did. I-I'll see you guys. All right. It's gonna be great. Bye, Ralph. I love you. Thanks, China. Well. Leslie, I wonder if we could talk for a minute. Okay, sure, if you... Yes, I, please. Sure, w-what can I do for you? Do you mind having a seat for a minute? Okay. Um... So... I-Is this the show you're writing? What? Uh, yes. H-how's it going? Uh, not good. I mean, I'm struggling. I have-I have a finished draft but I don't, I just I-I just don't know. You want me to read it? I can give you my thoughts. Yeah, I-I mean... Well, I guess you could take this one, I mean, um... Yes, I guess I would- yeah, I-I'd like that, if... Sure, I'll look it over. Please. Mm-hmm. Hmm. So, what did you want to talk about? Well, I think that-I think that we should talk about China. You-you wanna talk about China with me? Yes, I would. I-I think that we should talk about her. We should? Okay. What do you want us to say? Shit. You're gonna make me come out and say it? I need to know about China and you. I-I-I-I'd like to know what's going on with you guys. Well, shouldn't you be asking her that? No. No. I'm asking you. I'm asking you because... Leslie, because China is a- China is a minor. Oh, a minor what? What I'm asking... What I need to know is-is... Is your relationship with my daughter... Well, w-what is it? I don't know. You don't know? I-I like her. We're-we're... we're making friends. Okay, so... What are your, what are your int- what are your intentions? I don't have intentions with anyone. I mean, I-I find that intent guarantees failure especially in personal relationships I mean, in writing you need intent to create uh, direction and thrust. Without intent, the story stops, but... In-in life, certainly with women you don't have to do anything. I mean, you just go with the current. Let it happen. So, where w-where do you feel... Where do you think the current... Where is the current going to take you? I don't know. I really don't. I mean, I can I can say I think she's... I think she's sweet on me. I-I think she... I think she likes me more than a little bit. - I... - Look... I need to know that you're not fucking my daughter. Dad. Jesus. O-oh, my God, Dad! China. Oh, my God, you are... You're so fucking gross! - China... - No, you are! You are fucking disgusting! What the fuck is wrong with you? - Oh, my God! - China. China! Well. Was uh, it was nice to... Everybody, everybody, everybody! Please, please, everyone, please, gather to me. Tsank you, tsank you! Nice and see to sees you alls in here! And welcome... To China's surprise 18th birthday party! Right?! Are we excited? Uh, yes, where is she is a good question. Hang on. Hold on. He says "Hold on!" I'm checking. He says "He's a-checkin'!" He says, "The sheriff is a ni..." - Here she is, she, she - Here she comes! She's comin' round yonder bend right there ya'll! Yee-haa! - Happy birthday! - Thank you. Happy birthday, you look so beautiful. - Thank you. - Oh, honey. Thanks, Daddy. Okay, honey. Hmm. Oh. Looks like the luster came off the "I love you, Daddy" thing. Thank God. It finally looked like a normal father-daughter moment. You know, Glen. None of this... This party, the horse and carriage... None of this... Makes you a good dad. You know that, right? I mean, this is the kinda shit that Turkish gangsters do for their kids and they don't even know their names. What are you gonna do about Leslie? Come on, Glen. What's the plan? Nothing? Is that the plan? Nothin'? No, "nothing" is not the plan. Okay, then, what are you gonna do? I'm figuring it out. O-kay, so that's pretty much nothing. Hey, hey, what am I supposed to do? She just tuned 18. I know. I noticed. I'm pretty sure that planes flying at cruising altitude know that China turned 18 today. Well, anyway, she's an adult, so there's not much I can do. China's not an adult. Okay, yes, she's 18, but she's not an adult any more than you're an adult. Look, I know you're right. I know that I have to do something. Do you love your daughter? Yes, I do. I know. I know you do. It's the one good thing about you. Thanks. So, here's what a good dad does. He puts his daughter's welfare ahead of everything. Even ahead of her loving him back. I know, I know it. So, what are you gonna do? What does your gut tell you? Hmm? Hmm? I have to tell her never to see Leslie again. Never, never, never. Ooh! Yes! Yes! That is a thing! That is not nothing. Ooh! Yes, I'm so excited! She's gonna fucking hate you so much. Shut up. I can't do it. - I can't. - No, you have to. - I can't do it. - You have to. She's gonna-I'm gonna send her running back to Leslie. She's gonna move in with him or somethin'. Glen. You think Leslie Goodwin wants to live with your daughter? You think he wants to take care of her? Jesus Christ. You fucking men overestimate the shit out of each other. It's disgusting. Do it, Glen. Make her stop. If you don't, I'll stop coming around. Is that supposed to be a threat? Yes, it is. If you don't get her off that child molester's dick, I'm done. Because the whole thing makes me hate the both of you. And don't act like you don't like that I still come around. Because if I didn't, you would be so bummed out if I didn't ever come around to see China and yell at you all the time and fuck you now and again. Okay, I'm out of here. Bye, stupid. Hi. - Hi, Grace. - Hi, Glen. - How are you? - I'm fine. I wanted to see China. Hey, did you... Did you ever read the script that I gave you? I know that you and I are all weird, but I never heard from you, and... I read it. I read the script. Okay. Um... Clearly, you didn't like it. What did you think of your script, Glen? - What did I think? - Yes. Be honest with me. I mean, I thought that I captured your voice pretty well, and I think it holds up. Is that what you were going for? Something that holds up? I-I'm confused, I... I know your writing. I worshipped your voice. This is... common. Jesus. Tell me how you really feel. - I am, Glen. - Yeah, I noticed. Look, I have to go. Hey, is that it? You just-you shit on my work, and then you just take off? I mean, what does that say about you, Grace? What, did you fuck me so you can get a part on my show? And then when you see that it's not my best work, you... then I can... I'm a piece of shit. No, no, I didn't fuck you so I could get on your show. I agreed to do your show, so I could fuck you. And you should've told me you gave up. I can't believe I was intimate with you. I feel like I got bait-and-switched in the worst possible way. Holy moly. Well, I have to go. Can I ask you a question? Did you invite me to your party so that Leslie can meet China? No, Glen. I didn't. Oh, by the way, I had lunch with Jordana Newsom. She's amazing. Not a fan of yours. Glen. Yeah. Um, I'm just wondering when I can start to make the schedule for uh, the show that goes on the air in a month that we have shot none of yet? I'm sorry. - You're sorry? - I'm... Yes. I'm sorry, women. Wom-women? Yes, please, on behalf of all women, please let you all know that I am very fucking sorry. Okay, uh, we accept your apology. And I'm just wondering if I... Okay. Terrific. Leslie? Hello, hello. In here. Hi. How was your birthday party? Well... I'm officially 18. No longer a minor. Congratulations. Thank you. How you doing? Well. Working. All right, come on. Where? To the balcony. I wanna get high with you. Mmm, I don't think so, China. Yes! No, I suffer from enough - No! - natural confusion. I don't need the synthetic variant. - Come with me to the balcony! - Ah, don't. Don't pull on my arm. I'm 68, it might come off. Ah, fine. Then, we will get high right here. My goodness. Oh, my goodness. - My goodness. - My goodness. I'm not gonna smoke that, China. I'm not that guy. Sorry. What are you doing? What are you doing? Okay, what's the idea here? To make you smoke. I'm 18. I'm 18 and you're 68. And my friends... My friends think I'm crazy. They go, "China!" and I'm like, "Yeah, I know, he's 68. It's... "How long it takes to make a good man." Yeah, I talk about you. Shut up. I tell them good things. I tell them-I tell them how good you are to me, and... And how funny you are, and weird, and brilliant, and... And that I like you. I think-I think you're kinda sexy sometimes. Yeah, I know-shut up. Uh, during spring break, we play this game called "Mother, may I", um... It's-um... All the guys, they- they line up naked, and all the girls line up naked, and... It-it really looks stupid because the guys have their-their dongs out. It's really... It's dumb, but um... Um... Listen, the whole point of the game is that they have to ask permission to like, touch a girl so, they just say like, uh, "Mother, may I do" whatever to this girl. And mother has to uh, come up with a with a punishment. Um... And I... Usually, well... Always. Play mother. It's... a dumb game. I don't want you seeing Leslie anymore. - So? - So... You're not gonna see him anymore. You can't tell me what to do. Yes, I can, China. Yes, I can. Because I-I-I-I pay your bills, kid. I shelter you. You know what, Dad, I-I'm not a kid. You're not? Then what are you? Are you a grown-up? Do you-do you know what a grown-up has? Plans and goals and- and skills and experience. W-w-wha-how many times did you go to Florida when you should've been nailing your college applications? You let me go. I let you go. I thought you were a grown-up. I'm in high school, Dad. Okay, so which one is it, China? Do you want me to-to... Respect you as an adult? Or let you off the hook when- when you fuck up because you're just a kid? - Wh-which one? - Oh, my God. You know, most kids your age, they have-they're in a school already. - Dad. - Or-or they're... - Doing something, started on something. - Dad. I know. I'm 18. And I'm not doing anything. I'm not doing jack shit. Congratulations. Good fucking job. I mean, fuck. You know... I mean, you could- you could do something. You could be- you could do whatever you want. - You could be creative. - I could be... - You could try to be a writer. - I'm not creative. I'm not a writer. I'm not anything. Don't say that. You have a-you have a lot of... You're too late. You're so-you're so fucking late that it's over, Dad. I'm 18, okay? I'm not doing shit. And this is way too fucking late of a conversation. I tried- I tried to give you... What did you try to give me? You didn't give me anything. You didn't give me anything. All this is-is yours. All this shit around you? This is yours. I'm-well, I'm sorry. - Sorry? - I'm-I'm sorry. I'm fucking happy for you. I'm happy that you're sorry. But what am I gonna do? You know, what am I gonna do? What-what am I gonna do?! I can't. I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry. I swear to God, I'm sorry. I can't do this. Oh, I can't. I gotta go. China. What-what about Leslie? You fucking... That's none of your fucking business, Glen. You okay? She's okay. What did she tell you? She says that you kicked her out. Sent me over here to get this shit. I did not kick her out. Yeah, I know. She's pretty full of shit. I catch her lying all the time. So, it was about Leslie? Look, I can't let her be with some pervert, I... He's 70 years old, you know. And she's m... Zasha, I'm sorry. I-I don't need to dump- dump this on you right now. It's okay. I mean, China's the real pervert here. - China's a pervert? - Yeah. She has such a boner for Leslie, it's hilarious. You know, that's always been her thing. She had a teacher in 9th grade who she tried to get to come on to her. Mr. Hoffman. Mr. Hoffman? Yeah. Older dudes are sexy. Whatever. I used to have a boner for you throughout my teens. So normal. I mean, everybody's a pervert. I'm a pervert. We're all perverts. Who cares? Who cares how old you are? And... who you are? My cousin and I used to make out when our families spent summers together. It was so hot. I don't regret it. I had a thing for you when I was 14, so what? So, really good job, Glen. Just fucking stellar parenting. You let her go back to Florida. You let her go to fucking France with Leslie Goodwin. Then you kick her out. And then you try to fuck her best friend who's 17. I didn't even... I didn't even... Oh. Sh... Fuck. Yeah. Seriously. Very great fathering, Glen. You're amazing. What did China say? No, I'm not doing that. I'm not mediating for you, you chickenshit. She'll probably never speak to you again. And I'm not advocating for you. I don't fucking care. How was-how was Peru?

He has us shooting this scene in Morocco, right? A-and it's just, you know, it's me and Sandy we're having some bullshit dialogue or whatever. The show takes place in San Francisco, mind you. And so we fly the whole production to Morocco. And now we're shooting in this little café. We're having to redress it to pretend we're in America. Why, again, you fucking nut? The walls. The wa-yeah, the- He wants Moroccan walls, right? The cafés in Morocco have these walls that are that are made from pigmented cement, and... The colors come from pigments that are long gone. And, you know, there's nothing like it. I had to have it. The guy's gotta have it, right? But the network is shitting their pants that we're shooting Morocco for San Francisco for the walls. Right? So, they're not gonna stop it, right? They shell out the bucks 'cause they're desperate to get Leslie's first show. But they gotta put their foot down about somethin', you know? So, they say, "Let's hire local for the smaller parts." So, for no reason whatsoever, there's a guy, like the waiter in the scene, he comes up, he says... "Meh get ye anething els?" And the one guy in the network, like the head of the production guy, he cries, like actual tears are comin' out. He's lookin' at the monitor, cryin' like... Glen. Hi, Ralph. - How are you? - I'm good. Ah, Glen, nice to see you. Still ruinin' everyone's fun? Yeah. You okay? Oh, I'm good, buddy. - Yeah, I'm good. - Good, good, good. Congratulations, you're great in the-in the show. - You saw it? - Of course. You're great in it. And the show is-is amazing. Thank you, that's very kind. - Ah, so, uh... - You doing okay? Yeah, yeah. No, look, hey, I'm really good. - Good, good. - Yeah, why are you... Why are you here? You weren't nominated for anything. Yeah, I know. Did you even make a show this year? Yeah, I'm just hangin' around. You're breakin' my heart. Huh? Yeah. All right, you know what, I gotta- I'm gonna take a photograph. It's good to see you, bud! - Good to see you. - You gonna stay, right? - I'll decline, thanks. - All right. Good to see you, man. Do you want to sit? Yeah, sure. How you been? I've been well, I must say. I like making television. Episodes, I like that part. - Good. - That you make episodes. Mm-hmm. In fact, uh, it was reading your script that-that got me interested in the first place. Is that right? I-I'll confess, I-I didn't know exactly what you were going for. I couldn't see the intent. Intent. But in reading it... I... I got excited about the idea of writing something that didn't have an ending and had no conclusion. Which, they always seem false to me. Something about the fact that that television is in episodes, ongoing. I like that. How's China? You haven't seen her? Oh, not in a long while. Oh, I thought... I kinda lost her. Yeah, well, that's what they do, isn't it? That's the best part. The best part? When they reject you. What a thing. To be loved by a girl and then rejected by the woman she becomes. It's truly beautiful. It's like a truffle. If there were a truffle pig for emotions, and you sent it down into the deepest hole in life... That's the emotion that it would come back with. Amazing. Anyway. Uh, have a good rest of your night, Glen. You forgot your Emmy.

Glen, hey, Glen. - Listen to me. - I am nothing. Listen to me. You were a great writer. Great. Great writer. And now you're not. But Glen, listen. In the meantime, you and me got really good at making television. So why don't we just keep doing that? It doesn't have to be great. It doesn't have to be ground-breaking television. What happened to "damn good” television? Right? I mean, as long as we know that's what we're doing. I love working. I know you love working. Take your Emmys. Put ‘em on a shelf, look at ‘em every once in a while. Remember how great that time was. Then get back to work.

But the people there are nice. Good. Yeah. Oh, this girl, Ashley, she um... She just opened a design company. - Mm-hmm. - So. I'm probably gonna go work there.
