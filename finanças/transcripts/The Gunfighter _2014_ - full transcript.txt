the weary gunfighter walked slowly through the saloon. the long miles from Cheyenne had taken their toll who saying that stuff. he scanned the room with a suspicious eye. years of being on the wrong side of the law, had taught him that a tough man can get out of a situation. but a smart man never gets himself into one. please quit doing that I just want to have a shot of whiskey in peace but the gunfighter would find no peace. for the Henderson boys were waiting in the corner to kill him for the $200 bounty on his head. that true. you boys trying to kill me like this voices say no. lied the oldest Henderson boy. how do you know I'm lying. - the oldest Henderson boy asked to the air. - no. I didn't ask the air I'm asking you, your fucking.. ..voice. - said the oldest Henderson boy. - do please stop saying said.. - ..the oldest Henderson boy. - implored Tommy, the oldest Henderson boy. meanwhile the younger Henderson's hand twitched by the.. ..Colt Peacemaker on his right hip. he was thinking of shouting look out behind you to trick the gunfighter into turning around so he could shoot him in the back. - no I was not. - come on Johnny, again with.. ..the look behind you what were you gonna.. ..say was behind him this time. nothing. Johnny lied. he was going to say a bear. Oh, came on. bear Johnny in a saloon. Johnny's face turned red. he began wishing he was in a safe place. - at home in bed with his dolls. - what hey, I ain't got no dolls. - to calm his nerves he.. ..pictured himself combing his doll's hair.. -..and pouring them each a cup of tea. - no. wait wait wait you have tea parties with your dolls. but something about the younger Henderson's vulnerability opened - ..a door in the gunfighters heart. - nope. no it didn't. inside a sea of confusing - ..emotions bubbled to the surface. - no. he started imagining himself holding the younger Henderson and stroking his greasy hair. - no. - he pictured his first kiss with the younger Henderson. - no. - they both giggle at how clumsy it was. they know the next one will be even better. I'm seriously not picturing that. - but inside he was. - no, I'm not. - but he was. - no, I'm not in that's a final word. - but he was. - God damn it. - why don't you two go get a room. - hey.. why should we trust this voice anyway - just then the gunfighter had an idea. - hey.. - you. - me? think of a number between one and a hundred and then we'll see if this voice really knows what we're thinking. - okay got it. -Sally the whore began.. ..thinking of her favorite number.. ..which was 32. she then thought of her lady parts and how itchy they were before deciding to change her mind and go with 76. - her second favorite number. - the voice is rad. 32 is my favorite number but then I.. - ..changed my mind I went with 76. - and your.. - ..couch. - husband issues I'm at horrible since Saturday bill. you know anything about that. - oh no. - he did, but we'll get to.. that in a minute. looks like that voice really does know - ..everything. - the gunfighter noticed for.. the first time that the bartender was black. this was still unusual in the West but the gunfighter decided he was okay with it. - um thanks. -the people in the town.. prided themselves for their progressive - ..attitudes about race. - that's right. but would they still feel that way if they knew that Sam had been sleeping with Ned shillings wife. what relax Ned all right everyone has been with her. - guilty. - yeah you're right. - and Elijah Jessup sister. - well Sam has dead. watch yourself Jessup you best put that gun down I'll cut you in half. that music seems kind of ominous tone it hominis what's that mean you know like like something Bad's about to happen like i canti this gun fat. the stage was set for an awesome ballet of death. blood would be spilled. but who.. - ..would be the first. - wait singer, ballet of.. ..death, what the hell. I think this voice wants us to kill each other. meanwhile the gunfighter saw his - ..opening to shoot Tommy dead. - no no wait. that that one really is a lossy my hands - ..don't need my gun. - okay you got me that.. ..one wasn't true. but this one is.. ..yesterday Tommy Henderson made sweet.. - ..love to build Jessup's wife. - oh, nooo! wait he's left why mama? here's the thing about that. - Oh you are dead Henderson. - said Gabriel.. ..who had recently delivered a load of.. ..cream to the back porch of his brother's wife. - he did her in the butt. - what? - how could you your own brother. - yet even as.. bill reacted with disgust the irony was - ..not lost on. - know what I see oh where are you going with this and I'm just gonna retract my disgust right now if that's possible. for he had been regularly - ..sneaking into Paul Valentine's barn. - okay,.. ..you know we're good we're good here I - ..think we should just move on. - where he'd been having sex with Paul's favorite sheep Martha. - oh boy. - Martha Phil! Martha!.. that is why I've been so itchy oh you know what we all just need to take a deep breath here. we're playing right to the voices hands. sure there's been a surprising amount of infidelity in this town. and the bestiality should probably stop. and I might be gay. but if.. ..we start shooting the voice wins. I think.. the voice is giving us an opportunity. in a world where our deepest darkest secrets are unveiled one by one. maybe we'll stop doing the things were ashamed of. and start to embrace the things about ourselves we're afraid to accept. hell this could be the beginning of a new utopia a society based on fairness and tolerance where don't matter if you're rich, - you're poor... - or a woman. let's not get carried away but the point is is that the boys is showing us the worst side of ourselves and we need to show it our best. now who's winning? it was a good speech and things might have turned out differently if the crowd never found out that the gunfighter had just last night shot and killed the youngest son of John McCullers. because he quote had some breath that smelled ..like the ascend of a Chinaman. well you must be mr. McCullers. it was a true ballet of death. when the gruesome bloodbath was over. not a single person was left standing. except for Sally. the Itchy whore. you who celebrated by scratching her front porch. little did she know she would be mauled to death by a rabid wolf the very next day. well fuck. ~The Gunfighter~ Subtitles encode by aSa / 12.2018
