Downstairs. - You exhausted me. - Did I? You didn't let me sleep. What are you doing? You can't do that. Hello, you've reached Olga. Leave me a message. What's your favorite meal? My favorite meal? - Yes. Aren't you hungry? No. What do you like to eat? Ice cream? I'm sure you only eat candy and stuff like that. No. - No? Do you like vegetables?

Leave me a message. Hi, Olga. Camille gave me your number, but I can't reach you. I don't know where you are, but... I'm with Elsa, and we have to go. We'll be back in about an hour, so call me back. It's the blue one there! - Over there? Yes, next to the tree. Stay right here, okay? Mom, you have to stop doing this. It's so good to see you. Hello, Michelle. - Hello, Antoine. I don't want to stay here anymore. I know. - I want to go home. I'm sorry, Antoine, I tried to explain to your mom that she has to stay here a little longer, but... Don't worry. I'll take her back to her room. Let me do it. Here, put this over there. I have to go, Mom. You're leaving already? - Yes. Get some rest, okay? Elsa! What are you doing? Come on! How did you get out? Well, the door wasn't locked. Come on, we're leaving. Fuck, I don't have the keys! - You said a bad word. Shit. Where are they? I think they're in the kitchen at home. Hello, you've reached Olga. Leave me a message. You're a bit loopy. - What? You're a bit loopy. So, what are we going to do now? Take the car to buy some new keys? Okay, come on. Let's go buy some groceries. When is Mommy coming back? I don't know. Soon, I guess. We'll call her when we get home. Come on. But I don't want to go in your house. I want to see my mommy. - No, you're coming with me. Come in. - No. Come in. - No. Sorry. Sorry. Come on. - No. You're not going to stay here all by yourself. Are you? You're not going to stay outside all by yourself. You think I can't see you? What's the problem, huh? Look at all the stuff I've bought. Look at this. Listen, I'm going to leave you here. Too bad. You'll be all by yourself. Come on, let's go. Get a move on! Come with me. Antoine, are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm all right. My bag slipped. Elsa. Elsa. Elsa? Elsa! Elsa? Elsa! Put that knife down now! Huh? What were you thinking? Why are you shouting? You'd want me to shout at you if you "was" little? You close your hand like this, see? You press your fingers against the knife, but watch out for your nails. Got it? - Yes. And it works like a pendulum. See? Tuck your fingers away, okay? That's too much! You think it's too much? Here. The meal's ready. Do you like it? - Mm-hmm. Here, wait. The fish is tasty. - Tasty, huh? And you can eat the flower too. The flower? Okay, I'll try it. It tastes like hazelnut. Go on, try it. Mmm. Do you know the story of the frog? The frog with the big mouth. What is it? - The frog... meets an antelope and says, "What's your name?" And the antelope says, "Antelope." And then the frog says, "What do you eat?" And then the antelope says, "I eat grass." And then the frog meets a giraffe. So, "What's your name?" "My name is Giraffe." "What do you eat?" "I eat leaves." And then the frog meets the lion and says, "What's your name?" The lion answers, "My name is Lion." And then the frog says, "What do you eat?" "Frogs with big mouths. Are there a lot of them around here?" Because the frog with the big mouth doesn't want to be eaten by the lion. I understand. Can you write already? Can you read? Read? No. You haven't learned to read yet? - I can almost whistle. Go on. You have to close your mouth. Not like your frog. And you have to blow harder. What does it say here, below? "Papilionaceous." It's the Latin name. The name of the plant. Who glued the flowers? - My dad. Your daddy likes plants? Yes. Careful. You see, he used to collect plants, and then he studied them in his office. Ah. That's what we call a "botanist." What does it say here, below? "Papaveraceous." Careful. Look. Is your daddy dead? Yes. - Now? No, it's been quite a while. That's sad. Isn't it time for bed? I think it's time for bed. Can you tell me a story? Okay, but I don't know any stories. Wait. "The Elephant and the Butterfly." What's that? - Stay here. I'll go and get it. There. Hold on, I can't see which one it is. Come on. This one? "The Elephant and the Butterfly." What's that? No. You know the story? - No. Yes, this is it. - That one. "The Elephant and the Butterfly." Yes. You want me to read it? - Yes. But first, the elephant. Once upon a time, there was an elephant who said nothing all day. Like me! - You say nothing all day? That would surprise me. He lived by himself in a little house at the very top of a curling road. From the elephant's house, this curling road went twisting down to a green valley, where there was the little house in which a butterfly lived. One day the elephant was sitting in his little house and looking out of the window, when along this curling road, he saw somebody coming up and up toward his little house, and he opened his eyes wide and felt very much surprised. And pretty soon he saw that it was a butterfly who was fluttering along the curling road ever so happily. As the butterfly came nearer and nearer, the elephant felt more and more excited inside of himself. Up the steps of the little house came the butterfly, and he knocked very gently on the door with his wings. "Is anyone inside?" he asked. The elephant was ever so pleased, but he waited. "Excuse me, does anyone live here, please?" Still, the elephant never said anything because he was too happy to speak. A third time the butterfly knocked, this time quite loudly, and asked, "Is anyone at home?" And this time, the elephant said in a trembling voice, "I do." The butterfly peeped in at the door and said, "Who are you that lives in this little house?" And the elephant peeped out at him and answered, "I'm the elephant who does nothing all day." "Oh," said the butterfly. "And may I come in?" "Please do," the elephant said with a smile, because he was very happy. So the butterfly just pushed the little door open with his wing and came in. Hello? Antoine, where were you? I've been trying to reach you at home all this time. Where are you right now? Sorry. We went out for a walk, and I forgot the keys. What? You forgot my keys? Yes, I forgot your keys. - My house keys? Yes, I was in a hurry. I went to buy some groceries. Okay, okay. Great. And where are you now? - We're at my place. At your place? That's crazy. Put Elsa on. - She's sleeping. - So wake her. I'm not going to wake her. She's sleeping. I don't want her to sleep at your place. I'm going to call a friend who'll come and pick her up. That's ridiculous! - I don't care. I don't want her to sleep at your place. Wake her up. I don't get it. This morning you asked me to look after her, and now you want me to take her I don't know where. It's got nothing to do with that! I asked you to wait for the babysitter for five minutes. You think I'd have left her with you? Put your feet back on the ground! You think you can come back, and I'll leave Elsa with you? Have you lost it? You need to wake up! So what do we do? What do you want, Antoine? What did you want to tell me this morning? Nothing. It wasn't the right time. It's never the right time with you. Listen, how about I take her to your friend tomorrow morning? My mother will be at her place at 1 p.m. You can drop her off. Great, your mother. Yeah, my mother. What's the problem? No, no, no, there is no problem. You decide, you decide. Yes, I decide, thanks. What are you doing here? Can you stay a little? I'll stay until you fall asleep, all right? Listen, hurry up because I'm really late. You're not that far anyway, are you? You'll see, she's nice. I'm waiting for you. Elsa, it's ready! Here. Want a pancake? You want this or some milk? Right. Do you want sugar on your pancake? What, you don't like pancakes? What's wrong? Say something. You don't want it? Right. My brother Xavier is coming to look after you, okay? I have an appointment. Elsa, don't eat that. It's gross. Who's Xavier? I just told you. He's my brother. And you, who are you? I'm Antoine. I know a lot of Antoines. I'm Elsa, and you? I told you. I'm Antoine. What are you doing? I'm Elsa. And you, who are you? Right, that's enough. Let's get you dressed. I'm Elsa, and you are? Come on, stop that now. Is it open? Wow, you were quick! With all your bullshit, I beat my time record. This is Elsa. This is Elsa. This is Xavier. Hi, Elsa. I told Julie to meet me here. We have an appointment at the hospital before going to pick up Mom. I'll be back before that. Okay, see you later. See you later! Antoine? - Yes? Aren't you saying anything? What do you want me to tell her? I don't know, that you'll be back soon, for example? Elsa, I'll be back soon. See? She doesn't give a damn. I don't give a damn. You have three new messages. To listen to your messages, press 1. Antoine, hurry up. We're all waiting for you. What the hell are you doing? Hurry up. The message will be deleted. What are you looking for? - Look. Oh, what's that? It's a hairband. You want me to tie your hair? Yeah, you can tie my hair up. Okay, I'll do it. This is the first time I tie somebody's hair up. Really? First time for me too, I'm telling you. You must be kidding me. Mr. Neuman, good morning. Mr. Cuvelliez. - Sorry for being late. Indeed, you are extremely late. - Have you read my file? Your colleague has already told me about your experience. I wanted to assure you I've read the list of specifications for the restaurant and that I'm ready to respect them. Yes, I already know. We are very interested, my pastry chef and I, in the place, the spirit of the cooking and we'd like to preserve it. The sale won't be made if all conditions are not met. Are you well aware of that? I forgot to mention the owner has added an extra clause. She'd like Mrs. Rosenvalt to continue taking care of the garden. You'll have to hire her at your own expense. That wasn't part of the agreement. I know, but it's important for the owner, It means a lot to her. Sorry, how old is she? Fifty or so. It's okay for us. - But... It's mandatory. She won't go back on it. That wasn't included in the contract. I know. She just added it. To preserve the spirit of the garden, of the place, it's a little obvious. - Indeed. So, ready? I'm going to try the "swish-swish". No, after, it's pink. Oh, God, I'm getting it everywhere. I'm not good at this. You really have to teach me. Hey! Yes, I know. I'm terrible at this. But on my nails, it's much easier. Look, you didn't put any there, and you put too much here! I thought your nail stretched up until here, really. Yes, I know, it's difficult for everyone. Uh-huh. We're all doing our best. But it's a dog. I don't see how I can explain that to it. That's it. How was it with the kid? - Hold on a second. Great. She drew some pictures, I made her an omelet. Great. Yes? Ah, yes. I'm being polite, so you should stay polite, okay? And I don't wish your death, but you shouldn't say that about the dog. Hi, Antoine. - Hey, Julie. I was just behind you, you didn't see me? No, sorry. Come in. We have to find another solution. Our mother is in hospital, everybody works here. Ah, yes, exactly. Yes. Would you like some water? - Yes, please. I think you could understand. You've got a dog too. I know, but Kurtis is alone and anxious. Hi. What's your name? Julie. When's the baby coming out? There's still quite some time left. A month or so. Is it a boy or a girl? - It's a girl. What are we going to call her? - We're going to call her Nola. She's moving. Feel it here. Can I draw something on your belly? Okay, go ahead. Oh! That tickles. I think she's feeling it. Can I be there when the baby comes out? I'll be in hospital when that happens. Fine, you have a good day too. You know, I've never seen my daddy. Well, we'll be going. - Okay. Yes, we're off too. Bye, Elsa. - Bye. Get your stuff. We're going to see your grandmother. She's waiting for us. No, I don't want to go to my grandmother's! Get a move on. We're going to go see your grandma. No, I don't want to! Elsa! Elsa! Elsa! Elsa, come back now! Stop it now! Come here immediately! Come on! No? Come on, we're going to your grandma's. Come on, we're going to your grandma's. No, I don't want to! Come on. No! Elsa, that's enough. Listen to me. Come on.

To call back the sender... Antoine! What a surprise! No, no. Hello, Elsa. Come on! Come and see! Come on, give me a kiss. Elsa? Go on, Elsa. - What's wrong? Come here! You know what? I've prepared everything to make some ice cream. The ice cream you love. You know? The pink one. It's better if you leave us now. Come on! Come, honey, come! Shall we do a race? You're going to win! You're going to win! I know it! Hello! - Hello. DADDY Elsa? I'm sorry I left you here. You forgot this. It doesn't matter. Fancy going to the sea? - Yes! Come on. She mustn't see us. - No, I know. It's really high. - And beautiful, by and by. It rhymes. - Yes, it rhymes. It's really steep! - Yes, it's really steep. You doing all right up there? - Yes. Look at the sea. - Oh, the sea! Wait, it's better if you walk. Ouch, it prickles! - No, it doesn't prickle. Go on. Ah! Be careful, huh? Could I borrow some sunscreen? Yes, of course. - Thank you. Come, Elsa, I'll put some sunscreen on. She's called Elsa. Look at me. Wait, come here. - Stop it, mom. There you go, Arthur. It's okay. You can go play. Wait, let me take this off You can go play. Wait, let me take this off and you can go play in the water. and you can go play in the water. What's your name? - Arthur. My name's Elsa. Do you mind if I sit next to you? No, it's okay, go ahead. My turn! I want to get on! She's sweet. - Yes. What year is she in? She's five now. Yeah? She's in first year at primary school. Oh, already? At five? That's incredible. Did she skip a year? Yes, it was going well and she does a lot of different activities and all. I put her in a musical instrument class. An initiation class to music, right? He did that, but he didn't like it at all. His teacher was really bad. That's important, for sure. She's doing okay. She's taking piano lessons. And she's quite outgoing. He is too. Two seconds on the beach, and he comes back with a bunch of new friends. Funny how they just get together like that. That's how kids work. I want this one, please. No, not this one. It's ugly. Not true. It's a unicorn. - But the blue one is nice too. Come on, please! Good afternoon, can I help you? How much for a-- - Do you speak French? How much is it? It's 10 euros for half an hour, 14 euros for an hour. And the blue one? 8 euros for half an hour, 12 euros for an hour. Okay, we'll take the blue one then. No, I want that one. Could you wait a minute? - Okay, I'll let you decide. Elsa, you can't say, "I want." You have to say, "I would like." But I want that one! It's too expensive and ugly, so we take the blue one. It's a unicorn, and it's not ugly! Yes, it is. - Stop talking nonsense. Okay, fine. No quadricycle. Hard luck. Okay, okay, okay! This one then. So we're taking the blue one. - Okay. Wait for me here. Giddy up! Giddy up! - Come on, Elsa! Hup, hup! Faster, faster! Faster! Hello, police officer! - Hello, police officer! Will you carry me, Antoine? "Everything's fine." Hello? Have you lost your mind? What are you talking about? Why did you call the cops? - I didn't call them. You think I'm stupid? Is that how much you trust me? Calm down, Antoine. I didn't call anybody. What the hell are the cops doing in front of my place then? I have no idea, Antoine! I'm sure it's your mother. Stop it. My mother would never have done that. Of course she did. Yet I did call her! Let me call her, and I'll get back to you. It's not my mother. She didn't call anyone. Are you sure? - Of course. That's not like her. Tell me please what's happening. What's going on? Antoine, tell me! - I'll call you back. No, it's the neighbor. They're taking her to hospital. Where's Elsa? - What? Where is she? - Right here in the car. What, you left her all alone in the car? - No. She's sleeping. - I don't believe it. You left her all alone in the car? She's still sleeping. Antoine, you don't leave her alone in the car! Yes, yes. You never leave a child alone in a car! All right, I get it. Are you near her right now? - Yes. Antoine, seriously, are you aware of what you're doing? I took Elsa to the sea because she wanted to. She didn't seem that happy to stay at your mother's. I don't care if she doesn't want to go to my mother's! She doesn't get to choose! You don't do that! I sent you a message to tell you everything was going okay. That changes everything, huh? - Everything's okay. When are you getting back? Tomorrow morning. I'll drop her off at your place. It'll be easier that way. It'll be easier for you. - I still can't believe it. I won't be able to call her tonight, but tell her I miss her and give her a kiss for me. Okay, I'll tell her. - I'll be there late morning. Okay. Are you okay? While the elephant and the butterfly were talking in the little house, the rain simply began falling gently everywhere. And the butterfly and the elephant looked out of the window together, and they felt ever so safe and glad. Pretty soon it stopped raining and the elephant put his arms around the little butterfly-- Whoosh! The sun and the wind. Whoosh! "Do you love me a little?" The butterfly smiled and said, "No, I love you very much." Then the elephant said, "I'm so happy, I think we ought to go for a walk together you and I for now the rain has stopped." The butterfly smiled and said, "I'd love to go with you all the way down the curling road. Let's go out the little door of your house and down the steps together, shall we?" So they came out together and the elephant's arm was very gently around the butterfly. There you go. That's the end of the story. You know what, Antoine? I love you very much. Do you love me? - I love you very much too. You're going to sleep tight? - Yes. Want the blanket? - No, thanks. Is this the house? - Yes. Julie! - Hey, Elsa! I'm Alice. Hi, sweetie, how are you? - Are you Antoine's mommy? - Yes, I am. Here you are. This is for you. I made it with Antoine. Oh, they're lovely. Thanks a lot. Antoine! I'm so glad you could come. - Yes.

I just arrived, You've got my car? Yes, I've got your car, but we're in Namur right now. In Namur? - Yes. Why? - It's my mother's birthday. Antoine, this can't be true. Why are you doing this? I'll bring Elsa back after the cake. No. I'm coming to get her. I'm taking the first train. I'll be there in an hour, and I'll drive her home. Are you sure? - Yes, I am. Kurtis, down, boy! Kurtis, turn around! Turn around! You can pet him because he's friendly. He's a real doormat. You want to pet him? It's a bit heavy, isn't it? - Yes. Look what's coming! - Look who's here! Look, it's the cake we baked with Elsa. Camille! You're here too? Can you help me for a second? I think I might drop everything. Oops, sorry. I'll pick it up. Thank you. Don't worry, we'll wait.
