[typewriter clicking] [President Barack Obama] I want to make sure that both sides are refraining from situations that might result in people being hurt. [protesters screaming] [typewriter clicking] [somber music] [Reporter] As we reported last week, a protest in North Dakota against a major oil pipeline continues to grow. Over 100 Native American tribes have joined the fight against the project, saying that it threatens one tribe's water supply and its sacred lands. [music continues] [helicopter whirring] [camera shutter clicking] [music continues] [cash register beeping] [girl] Oh, my God, we should send a selfie to Mike. [girls giggling] [girl] Oh wait, let's take one more. [girl 2] One more, okay. [high-pitched ringing] [muffled conversation] [helicopter whirring] [camera shutter clicking] [cash register beeping] [helicopter whirring] [Cashier] 15 dollars and 30 cents, please. [helicopter whirring] [muffled conversation] [ringing continues]] [helicopter whirring] Hurry up! [somber music] [truck door slamming] -[Julie] Come on. -[scraping] [Sam] Are you sure you should be doing this? Why? Am I the only female in human history to want to nest while she's pregnant? [Sam] Why isn't Dan doing this? I don't know, why don't you ask him? We know how that would go. I'm exhausted. [sighs] How's it going with him? Eh. He's got his good days and bad days. I think he's in complete denial that this baby is coming. [phone ringing] Hey. Okay, so his income last year was 19,000 dollars, his wife's pregnant, his car was recently repossessed by the bank, and his credit score, [chuckles] 438. And he's a Republican. Yeah, he's perfect. [Sam] Every dad's in denial before the baby comes. [Julie] Yeah, but he won't even touch me. You know, sometimes I feel her kicking at night, and I ask him to put his hand on my belly and he's too scared to touch it. [Sam] Oh, Jules, you got this. [car engine humming] And that's my cue. [Julie] I'm gonna see you tomorrow, right? Yeah, unless you're giving birth. Thanks. [Sam] You're not scraping anything tomorrow. You better help out more. -[Sam] I'll bring beer. -[door opens] -Hi. -Hey, Sam. Need a hand? Uh... No, I think I got it, thanks. Dan. She needs you, and that baby's gonna need you, too. I got it, thanks. Hey. Hi. Did Sam help or... just talk? Well, I'll tell you what, you got this. I gotta go get some pages done. Okay, well we need to do the nursery today. I know. But I'm behind and I have to get some pages out. Fine. Thank you. [man over radio] The Department of Justice has halted construction on the multi-billion dollar Dakota Access Pipeline. The same oil pipeline that brought thousands of protesters to the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota. This victory for protesters was short lived however, as construction on the pipeline continues in areas outside of federal jurisdiction. Just as construction crews continue to work, the protesters continue to attempt to block them. [man 2 over radio] We are four days from the convention in Cleveland. Ohio Senator Rob Portman with me now, he's up for reelection today from Washington. [Patch] How you doing, brother? -[Sheehan] Hey, Dan, you good? -[Dan] Hey, Patch. [Sheehan] Knee bothering you again? Yeah, it gets a little worse when it gets cold. You gotta see this. [reporter] ...about 40% of Republicans in all three states, Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, Donald Trump has a commanding lead. -[silverware clinking] -Hell yeah! Well, you're upbeat, that's new. Yeah, he's on new medication. -Uppers. -Shut up. [chuckles] [phone vibrating] -[Sheehan] Is that you? -[phone vibrating] -Hello? -[Sheehan] How often do we get -Dan McKinney, please. -[background chatter] I'm sorry, can you repeat that please? [woman] I'm looking for Dan McKinney. You know what, I'm gonna to go outside. -Alright, thanks. -[Sheehan] Oh, don't go outside. -Dan, come on. -If that's Hillary, man, hang up. Sorry, who's this again? Oh, hi. My name is Ricky Scott, I'm with the Houston Daily . How you doing? The Houston Daily ? Dan, we really like that Associated Press piece you did for the Cleveland Refinery, and I need something similar on an oil pipeline that's getting some resistance in North Dakota. And I think that you have the right perspective. [Dan chuckling] Okay. The media is all over this Native American protest up there and we need a no BS profile on that pipeline. We need jobs, numbers, the importance to the economy. So are you in? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm in. [Ricky] Excellent. I'm gonna pair you with a gentleman from the pipeline company, his name's Elliot. And I hope it's not too much of an inconvenience to get you on a plane tomorrow morning at six AM. What's the pay again? [Julie] Did they say how they found you? My Cleveland Refinery piece. [Julie] Hmm. Hey, have you seen my field recorder? No, not for a while. -I'm gonna grab a snack. -Okay. Hey, get the list. Okay. -[Dan] Hey. -Here you go. What do you got? Sam and I are gonna go to the thrift store and see what we can find on this list. But, even that... Okay well, they said they'd wire the first payment tomorrow, so. Promise me you'll... What, Julie? Come back. [car horn honking] Be safe. I will. You stay warm, okay? [blues music] [music continues] ♪ Black cat on your doorstep ♪ ♪ A hoot owl callin' your name ♪ ♪ The hound dogs well they won't keep quiet ♪ ♪ And it's bad luck the same ♪ Welcome. -Dan McKinney? -[Dan] Yeah. Elliot Jameson. -Hello. -[Elliot] Hi. Sorry, it's a little tight. Yeah, it's just a little smaller than I'm accustomed to. You sure it's gonna fly? Yeah. You know, the commercial airport in Bismark's a mess, thanks to the protesters. But I'm coming in from Pennsylvania. It's an easy stop over and we could get some work done on the way. Okay, good. You know we had a little weather coming in, so... it might get bumpy. [plane engine humming] You religious? [Dan] When necessary. [Elliot] That's good. Hope we don't need it. [plane engine roaring] [Dan retching] Rough flight? There was a little turbulence. Here you go. [Dan sighing] Dan, I'd like you to meet a couple people. This is Sheriff Glasser. Sheriff. And Marty Sherman. He heads up the private security for us. [Dan] How you doing, Marty? Are those... These are all non-lethal firearms, they fire rubber bullets. You wanna try one? The bullet or the gun? Well, if you need anything while you're here, these are the guys to talk to. -Okay. -Alright, we should get going. Alright, nice meeting you. Hope you don't get car sick. [Elliot] I'll pick you up first thing in the morning. [Dan] Alright, thanks. Listen, Elliot, what exactly is it that you do? I connect people. I help people. The pipeline company is my client, but right now my job is to help you tell the best story you can. And what story is that? Whatever you write, whatever you see. Okay. You know, we're a lot more alike than you might think, Dan. How's that? Marine Corps. Spent some time in Afghanistan, some other operations. After I got out, I still wanted to serve my country. Helping get the oil pipelines built? Absolutely. America doesn't run on fairy dust. That's true. Can't tell some people that. [chuckling] Not California. Don't get me started. [car door closing] [somber music] [engine humming] [man on radio] ...large oil pipeline, which will run through several states when completed, will taint important drinking water supplies and unearth sacred burial sites. [woman on radio] By September, a federal judge should rule on whether construction will be permanently halted on the pipeline. [engine humming] [muffled shouting] What's this? Welcome to the circus. Grab your camera, do your thing. I'll circle around and meet you on the other side. [muffled shouting] [muffled drumbeats] Okay. [man] For the children! Come on. It'll be fun. Yeah. No, no, no. -All over it. -Alright.

[dramatic music] [helicopter whirring] [music continues] [missile roaring] [missile exploding] [camera shutter clicking] [guns firing] [music intensifies] [Elliot] Dan. Dan. Dan? Dan! Dan McKinney! Are you with me? [protesters chanting] Yeah. Yeah. Good. Alright. Come on. The truck's right over here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [somber music] [Elliot] Sure you're up for this? [Dan] Yeah. Yeah. Must be something I ate. I'm good. [machines beeping] Dan! Bob will answer any questions you have. -Great. -Nothing's off limits. -Is that true? -It's what he says. Scary thing to say to a reporter. It can be. Hey! That'll move 500,000 gallons a day once we're running. -500? -[Bob] That's right. [Dan] Can I get a photo? Is that alright? -Yeah, of course. -Alright. Let's get a photo of you. You're looking good, Bob. I'll be right here if you need anything. [Dan] Okay. That's good. Thanks. Bob, these workers, they free for me to ask them a couple questions? -One of them? -[Bob] Yeah, sure. Hey, Frank! It's not a cushy job for them, is it? Well, the boys show up with nothing. I mean, we give them a room, something to eat, they walk away with good money. Some of 'em don't want to go. -Really? -Frank, meet Dan. -He's doing a write up on us. -How you doing? Yeah, doing good. How about yourself? Nice to meet you. [Bob] He'd like to ask you a few questions -if you don't mind. -Sure. -You don't mind taking a break? -Oh, no, not at all. [Dan] How was your oil transported before the pipeline? By train. But, we had an oil train headed to Tacoma catch fire about a month ago. The pipeline is safer for everyone. So you don't agree with the protesters, I take it? [scoffs] Let me put it to you this way. How'd they all get here? Last I checked, America still runs on oil. [camera shutter clicking] [Dan] Thanks. Have you had any trouble? With the protesters. Off the record? [Dan] Yeah, you have my word. We've had some trouble with some of the workers and some of the native women. You should do some research. [scraping] [Elliot] What you got there? -[Dan] A memento. -Must be your lucky day. Yeah, I guess so. Too bad you can't keep it. -[both laughing] -Yeah. You could actually keep it. It's private land here, but once we get on the reservation you're gonna have to leave it. Okay. You hungry? Unfortunately, yeah. [piano music] I'm really glad you're here, Dan. I mean, the pipeline has just been getting hammered in the media. Yeah, well, I mean, you didn't expect chocolate and roses, did you? No, but I also didn't expect a bunch of radical activists to come and start provoking the First Nation people. That's what they like to be called. You know, transporting oil is risky. The question is, how do you minimize the risk? [Dan] Are you asking the mainstream media? 'Cause they got an answer. Wind, solar, electric car. Right now. Maybe a time machine? -[Dan] Time machine. -So we can go ahead 50 years when we don't need oil anymore. Yeah. Pipelines are safer than trains. And both are safer than not having enough oil. In Iraq, what did you see more of? Weapons of mass destruction or oil fields? -Come on. -Yeah. So how many Iraq's is it gonna take for us to run this country? More than a few. Yeah. You know, with the tar sands up north, and the shale in this country, we have enough oil to last a century. -A century? -Yeah. But it's useless if we can't move it. You're with me, aren't you, Dan? Well, I'm here writing the story, aren't I? Yeah. I mean, I use as much oil as anybody else. And I know we can't turn off the spigot right now, but I'll be happy when we can. I'll put it that way. -Agreed. -[Dan] Okay. Ah, thank you. Is there anything else you might need? No, we're great. Thanks. [reporter] The pipeline's original path crossed the Missouri River just north of Bismarck, a city that is 90% white. -[cell phone vibrating] -But when concerns were raised about a potential oil spill there, the pipeline was rerouted south-- -Hello? -...to go under the river right next to the Standing Rock reservation. Ah, Yes, Dr. Lombard, that was me. -[call waiting beeping] -Uh shoot. It's just my wife calling through, I'll call her back. What's up? [Reporter] 10 days ago, the tribe submitted evidence of newly discovered artifacts in burial sites-- -Really? -...asking a state court for an emergency injunction. But, before the court could make a decision, bulldozers started digging in that area. [protesters] Water is life! Water is life! Water is life! Water is life! -Stand back! Stand back! -[chanting continues] [man] You're all about to dig on ancient burial ground! All of this and all of you, are in violation of US Archaeological Law and the Fort Laramie Treaties upheld by the US Supreme Court. We are your brothers and your sisters. We want peace! Think about who will profit from your actions. Not your families. Three, two-- Behind me, pipeline security and police are blocking Native American protesters for trying to protect what they claim to be is ancient burial ground. [woman] A company who will pollute your drinking water! Leave this sacred land. [protesters shouting, ululating] [gun firing] [screaming] -[Ellie] Oh my lord. -This is crazy. -Was Dan there? -I don't know. I haven't heard from him for a few days. -You don't know if he's okay? -No, I don't know. I left him messages and texted and he texted me back saying that they had bad reception. [protesters shouting on video] Marty. Great, bud, thanks for coming. -You remember Marty Sherman? -Marty. -Head of security. -Dan. You met him first day in the hangar. Yes, good to see you again. [Elliot] Alright. He's just gonna ask you a few questions. [Dan] Alright. Noticed your accent the other day. You don't mind me asking, where you from? Biloxi, Mississippi. Gulf Coast. You got some good seafood down there. Yes, sir. I've been shrimping since I was a kid. Heck, I cook a mean gumbo. Yeah, I believe you. It's been a long day for us. If you don't mind, we're just gonna jump in. -Marty, is that alright? -[Marty] Yeah. [Dan] Um... Elliot told me about the bulldozer incident. Can you tell me a little bit about that? I understand you were there. Uh, yeah. Bunch of protesters got upset about the bulldozer and they gathered down on the fence on the company's land. So they were trespassing, gathering on the company's land? Well, more like the road, but yes sir. And as soon as we started digging, they came across that fence like crazy people. They were firing arrows and throwing pieces of pipe and stuff. Arrows like, like shooting bows and arrows? Yeah. I mean, I know it sounds crazy, but they had all kinds of Indian feathers on and they were drummin', hollerin', and they were screaming all kinds of war chants, too. They were really riled up. What do you think got 'em so riled up? [protesters chanting] [muffled screaming] [somber music] [Marty] They said that we were digging up some old grave site, but we did surveys. And there are no bodies buried there. [music continues] [rhythmic drumming] [Dan] Do you have any photos or video or anything of the incident? Be good to include in the piece. I think we were all a little bit too focused on doing our jobs. This operation is behind schedule big time. I just want to add that I don't have anything personal against them Indians, but you know, they just gotta let bygones be bygones. All that stuff happened hundreds of years ago. And we just all need to get along. Thanks, Marty. [music continues] [protesters chanting] [Dan] Let me ask you, the work you're doing, you and your guys with the sheriff's department, to what degree is it a coordinated effort? -[gunshot] -You know, Dan, that's a, that's an excellent question. Uh. They're just both providing tactical support to each other, so this whole situation with the protesters doesn't get more outta control than it already is. Keep 'em in line. Thanks a lot, Marty. You've been really helpful. Let's get you back to the hotel. -Okay. Thank you Marty. -Yes, sir. -Nice to see you again. -Good to see you. You know, they prefer to be called First Nation People or the Sioux Tribe. -[Marty] Sioux Tribe? -[Elliot] Yeah, it's just -a matter of respect. -[Marty] Yes, sir. -[Elliot] Thanks again, Marty. -[Marty] Thank you. [plane engine revving] [Ricky] Dan, the article is great. Front page. Now listen, call me ASAP. I have something else for you. [Julie] Dan, I've left you two messages. Are you okay? Please call me back. [voicemail beeping] We watched that crazy video. Please, let me know you're okay. Please call me back. Bye. [door creaking] [Julie] Yeah, we're supposed to be leaving now. You know what? My mom did it on her own and we kind of turned out okay. [Sam] Are you still there? Hi. [Sam] Julie, are you okay? Hi. I called you. I kept calling you and texting you, and you never got back to me. Why? What is wrong with you? I'm your fucking wife! [stammering] I don't-- We have class right now. Are you coming? Yes, of course. [door creaking] [gentle guitar music] [sighing] I can't believe you took a call, a phone call, in the middle of birthing class. It was important, Julie. More important than our baby? I couldn't just ignore it. Since when don't you know how to ignore a call? The paper wants me back on the next flight. Tonight. Well, the paper is not having your baby. I am. And you, you're just somewhere else all the time. And I don't mean writing your article. I put together a crib today. Look at me. I shouldn't be doing that. We need the money, Julie. They're doubling the pay. Fine. Go. You should go. It'll be good. Come on. I need a break. [gentle guitar music] [plane engine revving] [reporter] A push for US military veterans is underway-- [Dan] Hi, Dan McKinney. Thanks. Do you have a North Dakota state map? [reporter] ...2,000 war veterans plan to arrive at the site of the North Dakota Native American protest. Their goal? To serve as human shields for the protesters who oppose the construction of an oil pipeline they say crosses tribal treaty land. The veterans are calling on local and state law enforcement to stand down, claiming they are intimidating unarmed citizens using militarized police force. [keyboard clicking] Here's my license. [pensive music] [Ricky] Hey, Dan, once you land in Bismark go pick up your rental car and drive to the Native American Casino, it's on the Reservation. And just blend in. Don't mention the name of the paper, because they're gonna judge you for it. And remember, this piece is about the protesters. So I want you to send me notes every day. We need real reporting, not some fake news I can get off of Facebook, okay? [music continues] [clerk] No more rooms available, sorry. [woman] Come on, sister. They just need showers. Some of them came all the way from New York. [clerk] Well, maybe they shouldn't have. Just give us a key to one of the 100 empty rooms. [clerk] Can I help you, sir? Yeah, I have a reserved room, I think. Dan McKinney. Are you here to redeem yourself or make money for somebody else? Excuse me? Who do you work for? Big Oil? [chuckles] I'm a journalist. Freelance. This time for a place out of Houston. Mr. McKinney, your room's ready. [Dan] Thank you. [sighs] Listen, if your friends want to take a shower in my room, they can. If you're quick about it, I'm exhausted, I gotta sleep. Well, what do you say, guys? You wanna take charity showers from Houston here? At this point I would take a shower from the Devil. [shower running] [Dan] So. [woman] So? What's your wife's name? Even without the ring, you got that look. Julie. And what's "the look"? That unhappy, I'm married, but... searching for something look. Yeah, I am searching for something, but... it's not what you think it is. Hmm. Kids? Yep. One on the way. So, soon-to-be-dad comes to Standing Rock to do what, exactly? To write a story. On what's happening. Yeah, you and every other wasicu half your age with a Facebook account. What's wasicu ? -[chuckles] -[Dan] What? [woman] I know one of the guys who wrote this book. Walking the Medicine Wheel. Healing Trauma and PTSD. [Dan] It's research, I was trying to... learn a little something before I got out here. [door creaking] Thanks. [Dan] You're welcome. Well, I got my eye on you, Houston. Place has a way of getting to you. See ya. [brooding music] [reporter] Clashes between authorities and protesters at Standing Rock are escalating. Pipeline supporters are concerned that this violence has bolstered anti-pipeline sentiment in Washington. [reporter 2] The so-called water protectors have halted construction on the last leg of the 3.8 billion dollar Dakota Access Pipeline that could carry as much as 570,000 barrels of hydro fracked crude oil each day. The pipeline will run under the Missouri River, the primary source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. You have your credentials? I got a journalist heading over in a black Nissan. Go get this cleared by the media stand. [Dan] Okay. [brooding music] [Aketcheta scoffs] This guy. Next. Hey man, that thing's not gonna do much good out here. -What do you mean? -The only place you can get any service is over there, on Facebook Hill. -Yeah. -I'm Fish, by the way. Lucas Fisherman, but people call me Fish. Alright, Dan McKinney. You in the service? Yeah, Gaza Strip. Peacekeeping with the 107th. -Next. -[Fish] You a vet, too? Yeah. Military journalist, couple tours. -Middle East, Iraq mostly. -Okay. Sit down, please. Okay, who are you guys with? Oh, lost my badge, but I'm taking photos for the Truth Riot guys. You know Andy? Okay. He did mention you were coming. Here, fill this out. -And you? -Freelance. You have a press badge? Yeah. [sighing] [Mary] Driver's license? Yeah. How much longer for these two guys? A couple minutes. Hurry up. So you're gonna try and sell a story about Standing Rock? That just--that depends. He's with me. He's gonna donate the piece he's writing to Truth Riot. Is that right? Well, if they'll have it. You two are cleared. Print your badges out while Marion gives you the rundown. Alright, thanks. Not going in? No, I gotta take off. Okay. Thanks. Yeah, no problem, man. You know, they're just suspicious of potential, you know, infiltrators. But, hey, I gotta jet. See you later, brother. [plastic crinkling] [woman] Hey, sorry I'm late. [somber music] What's wrong? Promise me... you won't mention this to anyone. Anyone. Yeah. [Marion] So newbies, here's the deal. This is a nonviolent, direct action protest. Emphasis on nonviolent. Clear? Our council elders had a call with our lawyers in Washington, DC last night. They cannot stop the pipeline. So raise your hand if you've ever been on the front lines of a direct action before. Okay, This is for all of you, but especially you. Under no circumstances do you throw anything at pipeline security or a policeman. And do not provoke them in any way whatsoever. Is that clear? Okay. So, we're on the front lines and somebody grabs you. What's the first thing that you do? Ask somebody for help? No, you need to throw your camera to somebody on our side. You need to protect the truth. You have a responsibility to tell the truth about what's going on here. You are responsible. Each and every one of you. Ch'unkshi. Strong warriors... never stand down. Even in the face of defeat. [somber music] [Marion] Mary, it's your turn. Toksa. I am here to welcome you to the land of my ancestors and the coming generations of the Hunkpapa Lakota Sioux. This is Sacred Land. This whole camp is a prayer ceremony. [somber music] I am asking you to honor and respect our cultures and our traditions. Now, if you agree to this, raise your hands. Oh'a . Good. How 'bout we do a quick review of The Black Snake. Based on previous catastrophic leaks, the most likely future leaks are going to be right here and right here. When that does happen, it could possibly poison the water supply for maybe 10 or 20 million people. That is why you are here. You are the water protectors. Mni Wiconi. Water is life. Alright, Marion's gonna give you your volunteer assignments. Do you mind, can I take a photo of that? Be my guest. [Marion] Okay. Uh, Bill and Roger, you're on chopping wood. Brandy and Alexa, you are helping in the medic tent. And you, Dan, you're on dishes. Which actually starts in 10 minutes, so. Sorry. Wait, wait, sorry. The journalists are-- are--are expected to volunteer at the camp? Yeah, it's kind of the thing. Do you need help finding the mess tent? Ladies? Do you think one of you could show him where the mess tent is? Yeah, fine, I'll babysit. Come on. [traditional music] Washte. Washte. All these people were just moved here. Well, I hope you're not allergic to hard work, Houston. So it's just right over there. Okay. Toksa akhe. Sorry, what? It's our way of saying farewell. It means later again. I like that. Took-shack? -Toksa akhe. -[poet] Our ancestors... -Toksa akhe. -...followed the buffalo. -In a sacred hoop they roamed. -Toksa akhe. -Toksa akhe. -[poet] Tatanka was our source of life. Their flesh, their hide, their bone. To the north, south, east, and west, you could hear their stampede. We are the tatanka . Our skin, our blood, our creed. [flute music] Uh, hello again. You hungry? Uh, you know, I don't think so. But I'm ready to do some dish washing. Oh'a. This way. Hey. Terry, Navy. Dan, Army. You just get here? Yeah, more or less. What gave me away? [Terry] You looked like you just woke up, homes. Yeah, well, guess it's not what I thought it'd be. [man] What'd you expect? Bunch of Indians on horses shooting bow and arrows? Yeah, maybe. Probably too many westerns as a kid. Yeah, well, there's some young people here who want to fight, but most of us know that fighting won't get you too far. We gotta be peaceful on this [indistinct]. The Black Snake is a sign that it's time for us all to come together. What's The Black Snake? The Black Snake, the oil pipeline. Predicting prophecy for generations. When the black snake crosses the land, a time of great trouble will begin. What kind of great trouble? Let's just say it won't be good. [water swishing] [upbeat music] Andy from Truth Riot here. Don't believe what you're hearing from the mainstream media. This is what's really going on. Watch the video and please share. [Andy] Can you say what you just said, but slower? It's absurd how these people are being treated. They're being treated like second class citizens, and this has been going on for years. It's not right. There is legal precedent to stop this pipeline. The Historic Preservation Act protects the site, as does the US Constitution. The Lakota People's Law Project intends to seek damages, as well as putting an injunction on the pipeline itself. [Andy] Anything else? -No, I have a meeting to get to. -Great. Thank you. Alright. Hi. Excuse me. You're an attorney? Yes. And you are? Dan McKinney, journalist. What did you mean the land is protected by the US Constitution? You know, I gotta run, but... I'll tell you what, you come by my room in an hour, I'll explain it to you. -Okay. Where? -203. Alright. Thank you. [Webster] Hello? [dramatic music] [door opening] [Webster] Oh, hey. Yeah, come on in. Make yourself a place to sit there. I'm on the phone. Right. You heard what I said, right? No. Okay. I want you to get a title search going. I want you to find out who owns the land and then I want you to get back to me, alright? No, I'm not mad. Alright. Alright. Okay. Thank you, bye. -Busy night? -[Webster chuckling] The pipelines have hired private security thugs that just bag anybody that they deem a threat. What are these treaty lands here? [Webster] Alright, well, the part in yellow... there, that was granted as part of the Fort Laramie Treaties with the federal government. Now there were two. There was one in 1851 and one in 1868. But downstairs, you said protected by the Constitution. Yes. [papers rustling] Okay, this is Article VI of the US Constitution. Read the underlined bit. "This Constitution... and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land." In other words, the founding fathers included these treaties because they wanted these land deals to be honored. Everything you see there, on that map, legally belongs to the Sioux Nation. [pensive music] These treaties, and they're still valid? Supreme Court, 1980, the Sioux Nation v the United States ruled that the land was illegally taken from the Sioux by the US government. 1980? So if that's correct, the pipeline-- Crosses Sioux treaty land. And not just that pipeline, but a lot of oil, gas, uranium operations. What do you think? Do you think these companies want to go to federal court? [chuckling] [cell phone buzzing] Ah, duty calls. Hello? Yeah. Um, okay. Yeah, we can do that. We can go over the deposition. Yes. I know it's serious. Hold on. It's good to meet you. Thank you. -[Webster] Good luck. -Thanks. [Elliot] Hey, buddy, it's Elliot. Uh, again. I left you a message. Give me a buzz. [cell phone ringing] [cell phone vibrating] Huh, you're alive. Hi. [Julie] Hi. How are you? I'm still pregnant. It's feeling really real now, with the little bath and bottles and toys. Jules. [Julie] Hmm? I'm... sorry I left the way I did. Dan, are you okay? Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah. I just, actually, I just miss you. - [Julie] When are you done? -Shouldn't be long. I just need to move to the camp for a few days. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Wait, what? Seriously? You said, you promised. I saw those videos. You promised me that you would not put yourself in harm's way. How many episodes have you had this month, Dan? How long have you known? I gotta go. [clattering] [Fish] Dan the man! Awesome that you're joining us on this historic day. Hey, Fish. [Fish] Can I give you a hand with that? No, I got it. Actually, yeah. I'm not gonna say no to some help. I got you covered. So with all these vets coming through, I bet you're getting pretty stoked about your article. Uh, yeah. You know, I'm still...still looking for the right perspective for it, you know. Oh, dude, I'm late. I gotta go. I'll see you at the Forgiveness Ceremony? Uh, yeah, that's-- Wait, that's today? [Fish] Four PM tonight, man. Do not miss it. History is being made tonight. Okay. Got it. Alright. -Okay. -Thanks. -I'll see you tonight, man. -Thanks. [man] Hau, Mitakuye Oyasin. In the sacred hoop of life, there is no beginning and no ending. Our prophecies tell us that we are now at a crossroads. We must unite spiritually, or we will face chaos. [crowd murmuring] We came. We fought you. We took your land. We signed treaties that we broke. We took your children. We have come to say that we are sorry, and we are at your service, and we beg you for your forgiveness. [speaking quietly in Lakota] [speaking quietly in Lakota] Oh'a. [singing Lakota prayer song] Howdy, Houston. [chuckling] A little jumpy, aren't you? Where'd you come from? Oh, the sky. No, I was just... lost in the landscape, it's... I could see how you'd wanna fight for this. You wanna see what's really going on? Meaning? [Mika] Midnight. Just you. No camera. Okay. -Alright? -Alright. See you, Houston. See ya. [car engine rumbling] This could take a while. What's your story? I told you mine. Yeah, a version of your story. Okay, tell me a version of yours. [Mika] Uh, my reservation is a ways away, but... when I heard they moved the pipeline to cross here I said I would do whatever it took to stop The Black Snake. Kissed my kids and husband-- Wait, you're a mom? Yeah. And I just got in the car and I drove here. [Dan] How long ago was that? [Mika] About six months ago. Since you got here have you had any problems or... run-ins... with the private security or... police? Sorry, didn't mean to pry. [Mika] Two weeks ago, water protectors had formed a line in the pipeline's path so. And the sheriff's department arrived and... [scoffs] They shot a percussion grenade and hit a kid in the leg. And then, they grabbed an elder and began beating her. And they beat us, zip tied us and took us to a hill overlooking construction. And for hours, they made us watch bulldozers destroy our burial grounds. [somber music] They took us to this, like a huge garage, and inside were dog kennels. And they wrote on us with Sharpies. With Sharpies. I was number 236. And then they put us in those kennels. Like dogs. I'm so sorry. Did you know that if a non-Native commits a crime on the reservation, we can't prosecute? So we get all these construction camps, oil workers. Well, you can just about imagine what they do to our women. [music continues] [drone buzzing] [tense music] [Chetan] There's the snake. [music intensifies] It loos so different. Compared to what? There's a lot more military vehicles. We gotta go tell the council ASAP. [music continues] [car whooshing] [Professor Lombard] Where did you find this again? At a pipeline construction site near the Standing Rock Reservation, in the Dakotas. [Professor Lombard] Strange. [Dan] Why's that? Construction companies are required to do archaeological surveys. Usually a find this rare would be with other artifacts. Like in a burial ground? [Professor Lombard] Certainly that's one option. And how old is it? Around 1,500 years old. You're kidding me. We had the lab carbon date it. It is an important find. Any chance we could come down there and do a proper survey of the area? I seriously doubt it. Listen, I gotta run. Can you email me a copy of that lab report? Actually, I'm required to send the artifact back to you and I'll include the report with it. Okay, great. Thank you. Offenses include attacking a police helicopter with drones, unlawful use of weapons, unlawful creation of explosives, and establishing an illegal roadblock. The various activities resulted in 127 new arrests. What's been the cost of this operation to the taxpayers? We're estimating upwards of 10 million dollars. Sheriff, are you aware of the influx of US veterans joining the water protectors? Yes. We're aware of them. Many of our veterans are very, very vulnerable to exploitation. We just... strongly discourage our returning soldiers from misinterpreting the situation. So are you saying that they're incapable of interpreting it correctly? This is a very emotional situation. It's very easy to get confused. At the end of the day, we're simply here to protect and serve the law. Sorry, sheriff, uh, the law? The Sioux Nation has appealed the federal government's violation of land treaties. Shouldn't the construction be suspended until that matter is resolved? To the best of my knowledge, all the work has been sanctioned. If we're told otherwise, by the courts, we'll take appropriate action. [camera shutters clicking] [door squeaking] You're a hard man to get a hold of. Well, I've been focused on the story. Well, it looks like it's going great. I don't like being manipulated. They've invented a story about crazed protesters and weapons in camp and propane tank explosives. [Elliot] They have legitimate evidence for everything on that list. Forensic, drone footage. This is serious, Dan. [Dan] Look, they wanna charge the protesters, great. Do it. But do it legitimately. [Elliot] You know what's legitimate? Our right to build there. This is a nation of laws. And the law's on our side when it comes to this. The law says these people get screwed. The tribe's known about this for two years. 400 meetings. Do you know how many comments we got back? Two. They didn't care. Where's the oil going, Elliot? It's not going to US consumers, is it? It's all going overseas. Competing with OPEC is national security. We're about to be a net exporter of oil and gas for the first time in decades. That is energy independence. And at what cost? Where are you going? I was hired to find out what's going on. No, no, you were hired by us to write a story. I was hired to find out what's going on. You moved the pipeline right to the mouth of the reservation under the widest point of the river at their only water source. We destroyed their past. But you're destroying their future. [cell phone vibrating] -Yeah? -[Ricky] I need to know. Is he a liability? [sighing] Yeah, he's a problem. He's off the reservation. -[laughing] -That's not funny, Elliot. No, I know it's not funny. These articles are now being reviewed by the State Department. They're calling it an issue of national security. We can't have him turning the tables on us. [tense music] [speaking in Lakota] Hi, Terry. What's up? They know who you are, Dan. -And they want to meet with you. -Okay. Before we go in there, let me just explain-- They wanna meet with you now, iktómi. You gotta come with us. Hiyupo. [tense music] We all gotta face our demons. Sit down. [brooding music] We take infiltrators seriously. I understand. Please, just let me explain-- Who wrote this article? That was before I knew any of you. Did you write it or not? Will you please let me explain what I'm-- Oh yes, please explain to the poor Natives. How stupid do you think we are? Did you really think that you could live with us, eat with us, pray with us, and we would never figure out who you were or what you were doing? The first piece, I wrote for The Daily , yes. I toured the pipeline facility. Yes, and I saw what they wanted me to, and I wrote pretty much what they wanted me to. But then they sent me back here. And I see things differently this time. I do. And I'm trying to tell the truth. I'm trying to help. There is somebody that you helped. Chetan's been arrested for that drone flight. That's not even-- but how's that possible? -[beeping] -[Terry] Hey, Mika, something's going down at the bridge. They need you now. Inahni yo! Oh'a, iktómi. Oh'a, iktómi. Tricky Spider. Traitor. Pack your things. [distant explosions] [man over radio] Shots fired! Shots fired! [static] [intense music] [distant explosions] [Dan] You don't care about the truth, Ricky. You're just in this to make a buck. How 'bout putting yourself in my shoes for a moment? 87 soldiers from Houston alone have died in Iraq and Afghanistan. [Dan] Oh, come on, Ricky. Including my nephew. Truth is, down the road, 15 people died trying to refine that oil and 23 more before that. The truth is, what kind of fuel is in your car? How much fuel did you burn this year? This month, this week? [Dan] Give me a break, Ricky. There are two sides to every story. The side you see and the side you don't. And it is my job to show you the alternative side. [emotional music] [distant bangs] [chanting in distance] [explosion in distance] [somber music] Damn it! [car engine revving] [protesters chanting] [flare firing] [protesters] Water is life! Water is life! [women ululating] [water spraying] [chanting continues] [intense dramatic music] [frustrated shouting] [music continues] [camera shutter clicking] [muffled chanting] [tense music] [protesters] Water is life! Water is life! Water is life! Water is life! Water is life! Water is life! [music continues] [protesters] Water is life! Water is life! Water is life! Water is life! [chanting continues] [protesters] Water is life! Water is life! Water is life! Water is life! [chanting continues] [music continues] [music continues] What are you doing? Are you trying to kill us? [chanting continues] We came here to peacefully pray. -[music intensifies] -[protesters] Water is life! Water is life! Water is life! Water is life! Water is life! Water is life! Water is life! [gun firing] [high-pitched ringing] [heart beating] [soft footsteps] [somber dramatic music] [intense music] [hay rustling] [music continues] [indistinct whispering] [Lakota singing] [distorted voices overlapping] [singing continues] [voices continue] [high pitched ringing] [thunder rolling] [camera shutter clicking] [rhythmic intense drumming] [Mika] And for hours they made us watch bulldozers destroy our burial grounds. [words echoing] [bell tolling] [Elliot] You're with me, aren't you, Dan? [intense music] [electronic buzzing] [muffled screaming] [Julie] Come back. [electric buzzing] [Lakota singing] [Dan screaming] [Lakota singing] [Marty] All this stuff happened hundreds of years ago. [words echoing] [distorted screaming] [Marty] We just all need to get along. [ominous music] [gunshot] [Fish] We all gotta face our demons. [muffled screaming] [helicopter whirring] [Terry] A time of great trouble will begin. [fire roaring] Let's just say it won't be good. [helicopter whooshing] [explosion] [somber music] [Lakota singing] [muffled screaming] [water dripping] [sighing] [Lakota singing] [emotional music] [singing continues] [flags flapping softly] This is for you. [pages rustling] This is for you. Toksa akhe. Toksa akhe.
