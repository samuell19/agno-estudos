Melissa, you're going to do great. You're just going to call him back tomorrow and tell him you misspoke. You meant 70-30 exposure. Okay, fine. Patch him through. Mr. Flaherty? Hi. It's Sam Wallace calling. I heard there was a little misunderstanding with Melissa. No, you're absolutely right. I don't work there anymore as of today. I was just calling to make sure-- Hello? Melissa, he hung up. I think it's time to get Roussey involved. No, I know. You're absolutely right. But Flaherty can be fickle. Okay, fine. Patch him through. Mr. Roussey? Hi. It's Sam. Hi. Yes. We've had a little bump in the road transitioning Mr. Flaherty. No, no, no. Nothing serious. I'm thinking champagne, a couple of Broadway tickets. You know, I would. It's just I start my new job tomorrow. Hi there. I'm calling to see if you have any tickets for this Sunday's matinée. Of course I'll hold. Mr. Roussey! Everything's been arranged. Tickets, car service, the works. So, please tell Melissa that-- Okay. Patch me through. Melissa, crisis averted. Going forward, remember that Mr. Flaherty prefers e-mail, and don't hold back on those exclamation marks, okay? You're going to do great. Bye. Hey, you. What time is it? Am I late? No, no, no. It's still nighttime. Don't worry. Oh, our date. I forgot. I'm so sorry. Don't be sorry. You hungry? Starving. So, how was your last day? Busy, but good. I really feel like one chapter is closing, and the best one is about to begin. Castleton Investments won't know what hit them. Honestly, I haven't been this excited about something in a long time. I hope they meant it when they said I could take some risks. I want to focus on some of those independent start-ups I was telling you about. Always looking out for the little guy. Mm-hmm. How about you? Work busy this week? Oh, yeah. Alec has got some big deal he keeps talking about, so guess who's been picking up the slack? He's really lucky to have a partner like you. I'd say I'm the lucky one. What's that? An early Christmas present. Alec again. Now, where were we? Should you get it? You don't mind? Thank you. Talk to me. Yeah. Mm-hmm. All right. All right. Sorry about that. Everything okay? Yeah. This deal Alec has been working on might be going through, so he needs me back at the office. Rain check? Tomorrow night? Hmm. Sounds great. Oh. You might want to open that. Right now? Yeah. Why not? Hmm. I don't know. Okay. I got it when I was in Germany last month. It's, um-- It's beautiful. Thank you. You're welcome. Tomorrow night, it's me and you. Hi, Mom. Hi, honey. How are you? I'm great. I just finished hanging the stockings and I thought I'd give a call and check in. You might consider coming home this year. Mom, you know the stock exchange is open Christmas Eve. We talked about this. Yes, I know, but it's been eight years, Sammy. Uh, you're still planning to come for New Year's, though, right? Yeah, yeah. But it's not the same. Hey. Don't you miss having a real Christmas tree or my homemade hot chocolate? Or those cheesy puff pastry things I used to make? I do love those. Mom, I am starting my first day at my new job. I'm literally outside the building right now. Oh. I forgot it was today. That's exciting. Yeah. It's a huge opportunity to climb the ladder. Sammy? Sammy? Hello? Sorry. Are you okay? I'm great. Perfect. Yeah. I will call you later, okay? Love you. Love you, too. Bye. Hmm. Uh, excuse me. Excuse me. What's going on? Oh, sorry. Thank you. Thanks. Mr. Markham? Come in. Will? Uh, I'll have to call you back. What are you doing here? Where's Mr. Markham? Um-- What is going on? You know that deal Alec was working on? Yeah? It was an acquisition. You bought this company? I had no idea. I only found out after I left your place. I've been up all night. It's been insane. All those people leaving, they're out of jobs now? Yeah. We had to make some cuts. It's not the best of timing, I know, but hey, what can you do? Oh, but your job is safe. I made sure of that. Wait. And just so I'm clear, you're my boss now? Well, we haven't figured out the specifics yet, but I guess, yeah. I know it's a lot to take in. This isn't going to work. What do you mean? Everyone's going to think the only reason I got to keep my job is because of you. What? Come on. You're a shark and everyone knows it. You deserve this job, and if they don't get it, who cares? I care. I have to work with them. Build relationships with them. How is it going to look that I'm dating the boss? Then we won't tell anyone. This was supposed to be my chance to spread my wings, not be water-cooler gossip. That's not going to happen. And now that you and Alec are running things, I imagine that investing in independent start-ups is off the table. Well, I'm sure we could talk about it. Look. If you really don't think this is going to work, then let me make some calls. This is New York City. You could have a job by morning. I don't want a job by morning. I wanted this job. I think I just need some time to think. Good idea. Why don't you go home, and I'll meet you when I'm done here. We can grab some dinner, and then-- No. I mean, I need space. I need a break from us. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's not make any rash decisions here. I'm sorry. I have to go. Sam, come on. It's just business. Not to me. Oh, good grief. Am I hallucinating? Hi, Mom. What are you doing here? You know, I decided to take some holidays after all. Finally. Oh, I am so happy! Me, too. And your new boss is okay with that? Oh, yeah. You know, it turned out today was just a little meet-and-greet. Yeah. He thought I should enjoy the holiday before it gets busy in the new year. Well, I could just hug him. Come on. Let's get you settled. How was your trip? I hope the roads were okay. Oh, yeah. They weren't too bad. I forgot how pretty it was this time of year. You know, since you're here, maybe you could help us with the baking tomorrow. We're donating all the baked goods to the food bank. I don't think so, Mom. You know, the last time we baked cookies, it didn't end well for the cookies. Well, lucky for you, I believe in second chances. Okay, then. I'd love to. Count me in. Thank you, Sammy. Oh, everybody's going to be so excited to see you. Great... But first, we have to get the tree. So, why don't you drop your suitcase, grab the Santa hats? Okay. And I'll whip us up some hot cocoa. Oh. They're on the dresser in your room. Oh, boy. Honey, did you find the hats? Yes. Uh, got them. Have a good night, guys. Hey, Bob. Hey, Noah. It's a cold one tonight. No kidding. Here. I thought you might be hungry. Turkey on sourdough, and I threw in a cranberry scone for good measure. Oh, you're making me look more like Santa every day. Just doing my part for the community. Unfortunately, I can't eat it. It's our anniversary dinner. Val is making brisket. Oh, wow. Congratulations. How long has it been? 40 years, my friend. 40 years? Uh-huh. Wow. I know. It's hard to believe. Feels like yesterday we got hitched. But I guess that's what it's like when you meet the right person. You know, the years fly by, but time has a way of standing still. You keep that for lunch tomorrow and you say hi to Val for me, all right? I will do that. Thank you. Ah. Look at us, back together again. The peanut butter to my jelly, the salt to my pepper. Okay, Mom. Don't get too excited. The Sonny to my Cher. All right. That's just weird. "I got you, babe." Also, how come you get to be Cher? I have her voice. True. But you have her style. So, tell me-- Uh-oh. Here it comes. How is this Will fellow? Is it serious? Well-- Because he's welcome to come and join us here in Crawleigh. I'd love to meet him. That's really sweet of you, Mom. But he had other plans. Oh. Okay. Everything okay with you two? It's complicated. Wait. Where are you going? You just passed Bob's farm. Oh, yeah. Bob is selling his trees out of Noah's café now. What? Yeah. He has so many activities for kids and parents that it just made sense for Bob to sell his trees from there. Right. Now that makes sense. Mm-hmm. Honey, it's been eight years. You've got to talk to him sometime. I know. You're right. Oh, you're going to love it. Wait till you see the fire pit that Noah put in. He's got a thousand twinkle lights out there. That's a lot of twinkle lights. Mm-hmm. Here we are. Oh, there's Bob. Thank you. Merry Christmas. All right. Okay. Oh. So pretty. Oh, honey, put your hat on. It's tradition. Hey, Bob. Hey. Oh, well, well, well! Sammy, good to see you. Hiya, Bob. How are you? Good. Real good. Your mom tells me you started a new job in New York. Yes. It's great. Oh, good. Noah is around here somewhere if you want to say hi. I think, uh-- Noah, Noah? Look who's here. How about we go? Oh, no. I'm just going to grab a tree. I don't think we need a tree this year. Hey. Hi, Noah. Hey, Tammy. Sam. Noah. Welcome back. I'm not really back. Right. Can I get you ladies something to drink? A hot chocolate? A latte? I think they're pretty good on drinks, Bob. Yeah. Well, Noah made some cranberry scones if you're interested. Sam hates cranberry. Well, we need a tree. So, um, I saw one I liked. Bob, you want to give me a hand? Oh, you bet. The place looks great. Yeah. Changed a lot. Thanks. It's, uh, been a long time. Yeah. I guess. Well, I'd better get back inside. Enjoy your visit. Yeah. You, too. Good morning, Sammy. Good morning. Ooh. Nice PJs. Thank you. Want a coffee? Oh. I'm sorry. Couldn't help myself. It's okay. Thank you. I was going to wait till after my run, actually. Run? In this weather? Don't be crazy. Plus I thought we could decorate the tree. Now, I took everything up from the basement. I think I have everything. I hope it's enough. And how many trees are we decorating, Mom? Well, if you can see some green, add more sheen. Oh. You used to love these when you were little. Oh, man. Why do you still have this? Because my only child made it for me. In 1995, Mom. Mm-hmm. Come on. It's made out of food. Which is very nicely preserved in glue, thank you very much. So, last night with Noah-- Was it that bad? No, no. You just seemed a little nervous. That's all. I was not nervous. Was I nervous? Honey, you haven't seen him since you left. It's understandable that you'd be a little tongue-tied. Oh, I wouldn't worry about it. You know, the two of you will patch things up and be good friends in no time. Well, I don't think he'd be up for it, you know? Noah can be so stubborn. So can you. No. Sometimes. Maybe. Well, you got it from him. You also get your work ethic from him, too. He'd be so proud of you. I hope you know that. Thanks, Mom. You got a picture of him smiling, too. Why do you think I got it framed? He used to hate pictures. He was always too busy. Yeah. He was. Actually, if you're good here for a few moments, I have some e-mails I need to get back to. Sure, honey. $2.50 is your change. Thank you. You know Bob loves his Christmas cake. Oh, yeah. And nobody makes it better than you. I appreciate that, Val. Oh, and happy anniversary. Why, thank you, dear. He is such a sweetheart, isn't he? Oh. Yeah. And you know, it's not every day a gal like Marina moves into this town. Oh, Val, no. You don't have to-- No, but I'm right, though. What you've done with that book shop is absolutely incredible. Don't you think, Noah? Oh, yeah. It's great. Yeah. Anyway, I'll scoot this out to Bob and I'll be back shortly for the baking. Sounds good. Sorry about that. Nope. Not your fault. Val is just being Val. Both: Being Val, yep. So, um, yeah. We're about to get started. I'm going to grab some flour, and just make yourself at home. Thanks. Uh, hey. I was just wondering. Um... ...maybe we go could go for coffee sometime? Oh. Uh-- Oh, sorry. I mean, I know you're probably busy and everything. No, no, no. It's not that. I-- There's been a lot going on. All right. Can I let you know? Yeah. Of course. Oh. Uh, you got to try one of these brownies. New recipe I been working on. Let me know what you think. Okay. Thanks. Oh. Oh, no. It's on the house. Okay. Thank you. "Dear Tony, "It was great to meet you "at last year's holiday party. "I wanted to let you know "that I am looking to... ...expand my résumé." Everything okay in here? You've been gone an hour. I just-- I'm done. Good, 'cause we're already late. Late for what? Well, the bake-a-thon for the food bank. Remember? Oh, right. Right. Where are we going? Uh-- No. No! He has the biggest kitchen in town. Mom! He's got three ovens. Three. But don't worry. We'll be done in a few hours. And really, there'll be so many of us there that you won't even have to talk to him if you don't want to. I don't want to. Well, the thing is, I already told them you'd come and help. So-- Well, okay, then. Let's bake some cookies. Excellent. The theme this year is ugly Christmas sweaters. Sorry. Perfect. Wow. I know, right? He's done an amazing job on the renovation. Well, make it quick. We got to go make some cookies. Hello. Hey. I'm so sorry. I didn't know you were here. Oh, it's all good. I take it you're here for the baking? Um, yeah. Sorry to crash the party. My mom made me come. Everything okay? Oh, yeah. You know, just life. Right. You need a hand with anything? You ready for this? Nope. Any advice? Yeah. Keep your head down and stay out of the way. I'm kidding. All right. We better get in there. Oh, and there's someone here you might want to see. No way. Sam? Tessa? Hi. Oh! I haven't seen you in forever. I know. But look at you. You're growing a human. Number three. I haven't seen my toes since 2014. Wow. That's incredible. Congratulations. Thank you. Not about the toes. About your baby. Well, the boys already look so much like their dad, so I'm just holding out hope that this one is a mini-me. Wow. So, you don't know if it's a girl or a boy? No. It's the best surprise life has to offer. Although you coming home is a pretty close second. It's just a visit. Oh, for crying out loud. Samantha, is that really you? It's really me. Hi, Val. It's so nice to see you. Well, yeah. Likewise. Oh, we've missed you. Yeah. Holy smokes. We haven't seen you since-- Well, it's been a while. Have you met Marina? She owns the bookstore over on Main Street. Hi. I'm Sam. Hi. It's so nice to meet you. I've heard a lot of things about you. Don't worry. They're good things. Oh, great. Sam, why don't you take off your coat and let's get baking? Oh, you know... I was just going to bake with it on. I'll take your coat. Ooh. Wow. Marina: Hey, by the way, those mint chocolate brownies were so good. Right? Life-changing. Yeah. I'm so glad you like them. So yummy. New recipe. Oh, you should just keep making it, honestly. I'll buy the whole thing. Okay. Um, well, I'm going to get going. I think you guys have everything you need. If you need me, I'll be outside. Hey, wait. Aren't you going to stay and help us bake? I'm providing everything but the labour. What more do you want from me? Good luck. Okay, ladies. Shall we get started? Yes. Let's do this. Got to beat her record of 123 cookies... Thank you very much... Careful. Stay three feet away, remember? We talked about this. Come on. Come on. I'm sorry about that. They're crazy. It's all right. Hey. How you doing, Pop? Yeah. I'm good, I'm good. Just dropped Tessa off. I'm officially an Uber driver now. Unpaid, of course. Yeah. The whole electrician thing that I went to school for? Hobby. Yeah. I see that Sam is back. Yeah. I saw. Is that weird? No. Her and I were a long time ago. Yeah? Well, that log there would say otherwise. Well, she's looking like a real New Yorker. Those black trench coats are like a uniform. They must hand them out to everyone that moves there. She's not a New Yorker. No. I understand. It's just he said that if I ever wanted to come work for him all I'd have to do was call, so I'm calling. Okay. Thank you for your time. I love this ugly sweater theme, but I'm sweating bullets. Why do they even bother making maternity sweaters out of wool? Oh, that's better. Now I'm hungry again. So, how's it going in New York? Is it everything you thought it would be? Yeah. Sometimes. Do you ever miss Crawleigh? You know, most of the time I'm so busy, I don't know what city I'm in. Other times... ...yeah, I do. Would you ever consider moving back? No, not really. I mean, everything I've worked my whole life for is in New York, so-- Besides, this place feels like it's moved on, you know? I'm not sure I'd fit in here anymore. And New York has the best takeout. So-- Like deep-fried pickles? Mm-hmm. Mac and cheese? Spring rolls? I could seriously eat my way out of a room full of spring rolls right now. All of it and more. Oh, that's it. We're moving. You ever actually consider leaving Crawleigh? Not really. No. Ronny and me, we never had the urge to see what was out there. But we're not you. You wanted to go out there and change the world since you were a kid. You did the right thing in going. You had to follow your dreams. It's funny. You start out with one intention, and then you wake up one day and you're somewhere completely different. Sam, you are doing great. You live in a fancy apartment and you look like a movie star. I mean, come on. Seriously. Look at those boots. How much did those boots cost? Too much. Oh, I would trade places with you for a day if I could. Yeah. Me, too, you. You and Ronny. Seems like you got it right. Yeah. Well, everyone's got their own path, you know? Mine just so happens to be repopulating rural communities. Anyways, we should get back in there. Who knows what kind of mess they made? Okay. I'm going to need you to come around here and help me. Oh, yeah. Here. Here we go. Whew. Okay. Yeah? Let's go eat some cookies. Well, decorate cookies. I'll probably eat the cookies. Oh, there you are. We thought the two of you had flown the coop on us. Oh, I'm not sure I'm flying anywhere these days, Val. Sam: Holy smokes. Look at this. There are not enough people in Crawleigh to eat all these cookies. You'd be surprised. The town has actually grown a lot in the last few years. Hey, honey, we already prepped the icing. So, just grab one and let's get this show on the road. Mm-hmm. On it. You're going to love it. Mm-hmm. Ooh, I like-- So, Tessa? Mm-hmm? You're definitely going to want to do these, unless you want it to look like a four-year-old did them. Just do the base layer. I'll get the details. Come on. Try it. So, um-- Oh, boy. Oop. Oh, that came out faster than I expected. It's okay. It's okay. You get a mulligan and I get a snack. See? It's all good. Perfect. Like this? Mm-hmm. All right. So, um-- Yeah, sure. Marina? Her and Noah, they're-- Well, they're just friends as far as I know. Right. Would it bother you, though? No. Not at all. Okay. Oh. Okay. I told you this was a bad idea. It's okay. I am-- It's okay. It's okay. Look. You can fix anything with a little TLC. Sorry. I thought you'd all left. Sorry. Just finishing up. The, um... ...cookies look good. Oh, yeah? You know me. Master chef. Yeah. If by "master chef" you mean hurricane of disaster, then yes. Come on. I was not that bad. You couldn't make a box of mac and cheese to save your life. I still maintain the recipe asks for too much butter. The butter is what makes it good. I like it soupy. It should never be soupy. Ever. Noah-- Don't. Please. Noah, stop. We have to talk about it. I'm about to close up. You almost done here? I didn't handle it well. You know, I found out you moved to New York from Val, of all people? I know. I had to go, Noah. I couldn't stay here. I felt trapped. I felt like I couldn't be who I wanted to be or do what I wanted to do in Crawleigh. But the truth is, when it came to leaving... ...well, I just knew that if I told you face to face... ...I wouldn't be able to go. It's water under the bridge, Sam. That's it? I just don't see the point in rehashing things. And plus, you're leaving in a few days anyway. Right? Right. Hey, sorry. I forgot my... ...scarf. Well, that's okay. We were just finishing up. Well, good night, then. Good night. It was nice meeting you. Nice to meet you, too. So, I will see you around, I guess. Yeah. I think so. Great. Oh, good morning, Sammy. 'Morning. So, what do you think? More holly? Yeah. Sounds good. Whatever you want. Oh, I was thinking about Christmas dinner. I think we should make that pastry puff thing I used to make when you were little. Yeah. Sounds perfect. I don't want to pry, but it seems like something's bothering you. You okay? Yeah. Just thinking. About? Everything. Being here, sleeping in my old room, seeing my old friends. It's just-- Oof. A lot of memories, you know? Not all bad. No. Not all bad. Any luck patching things up with Noah? No, and I don't think he cares that much, honestly. You know? I don't think you're right about that. No, Mom. Trust me, okay? I even tried apologizing last night, and no. He made his stance very clear. Not much else I can do at this point. Well, you know, he's taking all the baked goods over to the food bank today. What if you offer to give him a hand? You're kidding me, right? No. What's the worst that could happen? If he says no, you'll be right back here with me rolling phyllo. Mom! And if he says yes, you could enjoy yourself. You used to love doing that kind of thing. And if you need a little sweetener-- Consider it an olive branch. That would never work. All right. Steady now. Oh, boy. Okay. Steady. This way. No, no, no, guys. This way. This way. Oh, oh! Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry. Okay. All right. Just be careful. Careful. Don't go too fast. You're walking backwards. And careful. There's a step here. Okay. Got it. Got it. Got it. I'm losing it. Bob? Oh. Oh, Sam, thank you so much. It seems like Bob brought his butterfingers to work. I've been clumsy since the day you married me. Oh, boy. Okay. Less talking, more moving. You got that, Bob? Yeah, yeah. All right. Nice and easy, now. Ah. Success. Well, that's not actually the word I would've used, but it's in one piece thanks to Sam. I'm happy to help. Noah, I want to say thank you, man. I can't believe you stayed up all night to finish it. All night? Just doing my part for a good cause. I mean, I know you like cookies, Bob, but that's a lot of ginger. It's not for me. No, no. I'm auctioning it tonight at the seniors' bingo, and all the proceeds are going to the food bank. Oh, wow. That's great, Val. Well, they need all the help they can get. The last few years have been pretty hard on a few folks. Okay. That's Carol-Anne. We better, like, move it. Yep. Bye, guys. Thanks again. Bye. See you guys. Don't hit any bumps. Never a dull moment, huh? Nope. Oh, Noah? I wanted to talk to you about-- Hey, Noah? Noah? Oh, did you want something from the café? No. It was about the food bank. My mom said that you were taking some of those baked goods there today. Yeah. That's the plan. Okay. Any chance you need a hand? I'm good, thanks. Would it kill you to accept some help? It might. I'm sure you have better things to do. Actually, I don't. I don't have anything to do. I don't even have a job. What do you mean? Yeah. No one really knows, but it's a fact. I am currently unemployed. With zero prospects. So, yeah. What happened? It's a long story. Are you okay? I'm fine, but if you accepted my help, that would actually be doing me a favour. So-- I just thought because, you know, we used to do the whole food bank thing together, that we could, um-- But you know what? This is a really stupid idea, and you don't want to see me. So, I will, um-- Here. Consider it an olive branch... ...or kindling. You can burn it. Whatever you wanna do with it. Did you make this? Oh, I so wish I could say yes. No. No. My mom made it. I drove it here, you know? And it was a really difficult drive. Mm-hmm. I was just about to start packing up. You free now? As a bird. I can't believe you still drive that thing. It was ancient when we were in high school. Come on. You used to love this truck. I loved that you had a truck. This thing belongs in a museum. Glad to see your sense of humour is still intact. I'm glad to see you still can't say no to a lost cause. You're not a lost cause, Sam. Oh, I don't know about that. Are things really that bad in New York? Let's put it this way. What I thought was going to be a huge opportunity completely blew up in my face, in every possible way. Basically, I was waiting for this position to open up at this investment firm for years, and it finally happened. I resigned from my old job. I transferred all my clients. And on the first day, I discovered Will, this guy I was seeing, bought the company. You're kidding. His partner spearheaded the deal, but yeah. They bought it, and promptly let a bunch of people go. It was awful. Wait. So, he fired you? No. Technically, I quit. I mean, he just assumed that I'd be fine working for him. I mean, didn't he see how unfair it was for everyone else that I got to keep my job and they didn't? It's wrong. Sounds like you did the right thing. Maybe. But now no one's answering my calls or my e-mails. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry. I just hate not having a plan, you know? I haven't been unemployed since I was 15. I don't know what to do with myself if I'm not... ...busy? Yeah. Well, maybe slowing down isn't such a bad thing. Says the guy who stayed up all night baking a gingerbread house for charity. Yeah. Are things really as bad as Val said? Unfortunately, yeah. The recession hit pretty hard up here. You know, the plant closed down. A lot of people lost their jobs. Businesses have been closing up all over town. That's terrible. People put on a brave face, but it's been tough. I feel so bad I didn't know. Sounds like you've had a lot on your plate, too. But hey, you're here now, right? That's got to count for something. Well, thanks for letting me tag along. Well, don't thank me yet. You haven't seen what we're walking into. What does that mean? You'll see. Wow. Yep. You weren't kidding. Well, we heard that the post office is going to be moving into that building there, so maybe that'll bring a little life back. Oh. Hey, Noah. Hey, Carol-Anne. Here are the keys. Thank you. Can't stay long. I got to get back to the office. But if you-- Hey. Who's this? Hi. I'm Sam. Hi. We, um, went to school together. Huh. She's Tammy's daughter. Of course! You live in New York. Your mom is always talking about you. Oh, I'm glad you brought some backup this year. You're going to need it. Can I help you with some of that before I hit the road? Yes. Okay. We have a lot of cookies. Ooh. Okay. Sorry about the dust. Nobody's been in here since last year. I brought over everything from City Hall's donation bin. Not as much as I'd hoped. Yep. Does this fridge work? Doesn't look like it, and I don't have any money left for repairs. So, it's dry goods only this year. Well, I could take a look at it if you want. Well, be my guest, but don't put yourself out. You've already done so much. No. I have my toolbox in the truck. I'll grab 'em and see what I can do. That Noah, he's a good one. Yeah, he is. After all he's been through, he still shows up every year. What do you mean, "all he's been through"? Almost losing the café a few years ago. Right. That. All the work he's put into that place, bringing in secondary vendors, and hiring local artists and musicians. He's really made the café a cornerstone of the community. That guy? He never stops. No idea if I have what I need, but we'll find out real quick. Oh. Looks like the icing has melted on a few of these. Yeah. Those would be mine. My piping skills are a little rusty. Oh. Uh, they're fine. It's the thought that counts, right? Yeah. It's the thought that counts. Carol-Anne: Anyways, I got to hit the road. It's nice meeting you, Sam. Likewise. All right. Good luck, you two. All right. See you later. All right. Bye. Off to a good start. Yeah. Oh. There you go. This one? For a minute? So, we are looking for the fuse box. Gotcha. Fuse box. Oh, Noah, look. Remember this? Oh, yeah. We had to hang it on the wall over that massive hole you made you made sophomore year. Someone was supposed to be holding the ladder. Someone was busy cleaning up the tomato sauce that somebody spilled everywhere. Oh, there it is. Now, let's... see what we got. Huh... It's stuck. What does that mean? It means... I'm gonna need a minute. Okay. Okay. What do they have here? What are you doing back there? You'll see. Better! Hmm? What? Nothing. It's just, uh... you always manage to surprise me. You think I'm a sell-out, don't you? I never said that. You didn't have to. And for the record, I didn't sell-out right away, okay? I started out at a non-profit when I first moved to New York, and I really, really loved it. They lost their funding, I got laid off, bills started to pile up, and I thought I was going to have to move home, which I couldn't do. I couldn't give up. So, I got into finance, and I had to work really hard to get up to speed. And then, suddenly, the years were just flying by. I was missing birthdays and Christmases and all of this. And I just-- I had to try to keep myself busy because if I'd stopped to think... And look at me now, right back where I started. What was it all for, you know? Well, maybe this isn't such a bad thing. A chance for you to get back to your roots a little bit. I just put so much time and effort into getting where I am. Doing that just feels like I would be... giving up. It wouldn't be giving up. More like changing course. Well, you didn't change course when things got hard at the cafe, now, did you? I guess not. All right, you want to try this? Yes, I'd love to. Let's do it. Okay. Wanna do the honours? You did it! Wow! Well done! Now, we just need to fill it. There's just not enough. I know. I wish we could do more. I don't want people to have a sad memory. Isn't there something we can do to make it more uplifting somehow? What do you mean? Okay, this might sound crazy. What if we made it into a store? We could have different stations set up around the room and people could come through and just take what they want, like they were shopping for Christmas dinner. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! We could even hire a Santa and he could hand out donated toys to kids. Oh! If there are any trees left at the cafe, we could just give them to families who need them. We could play music. We could give out snacks, you know, and we could make a punch. Turn it into something really joyful, a real Christmas experience! Sam... Sam: Yes? We have one day. I know, which is exactly why we have no time to waste. Noah, what do you think? You in? Let's do it. Sammy, what are you doing? Mom, did you know that you have 22 strands of extra Christmas lights downstairs? No, I did not know that. Well, I tested them all and surprise, most of them work. But there are a lot that don't and those are there, so you need to throw those out, Mom. Okay. Well, thank you for sorting them. But can I ask you why you're doing all this at seven in the morning? Oh. Sorry. I was going to tell you. I'm throwing a magical Christmas Eve soiree at the foodbank. You are? It's really last minute, hence the all-nighter, but we're giving the foodbank a major facelift. We're gonna have visits with Santa, toys for every kid, free Christmas trees, and then we're gonna make it so pretty. That is incredible! And the last thing is the name. I've been wracking my brain all night. I cannot come up with something. It needs to be... catchy, um, family friendly, welcome to all. How about... "The Heart of the Holidays"? Have I told you lately that I love you? Probably. That's perfect. I am so tired. I'll make us coffee. Want some whipped cream with it? Um... always. Yes, for delivery tomorrow. Ten a.m. would be perfect. Thank you so much. Bob! Sammy! How you doing? Good. Great. I was wondering if you would consider donating some trees for a good cause. Is this for your Christmas soiree? Yes! I just got off the phone with your mom. I love it. Of course we'll donate. We will? I mean, of course, we will. What are you talking about? I'll fill you in later. Listen, is there anything else you need help with? You know me, I can spread the word, create some buzz. You're an angel, you know that? I just made this and I was gonna have copies made and post them around town, but if you're free-- Say no more. I'm on it. Nice! And if you have any extra garland lying around, I was thinking it would be so nice if we strung it around the Santa display. Yeah. Santa? And speaking of Santa, Bob... Hey, hey, hey, look who it is. Hey, guys! Wow. We leave you two alone for one day and, bam, the whole town is buzzing. So... what can we do to help? Are you kidding? I can't ask you to do anything. You're... Tired and I'm restless, and I really need something to pass the time quickly, so honestly, how can we help? Sorry. Uh, we're two days overdue. Gotcha. Okay. Well, I was thinking about setting up a gently used toy donation bin in here, if it was okay with Noah. Works for me. Ooh, say no more! I have a basement full of stuff I need to get rid of and a group chat with moms from four counties. We'll get you sorted. Amazing. So fun! Yay! Ronny, grab my drink. Good luck. Thank you. We'll see you later. See ya. All right. Well, I think we're gonna need more wrapping paper. I think you're right. Hey. Am I too late? No. Not at all. I heard from Tessa. She said you were looking for toys and things for the foodbank. Yeah, that's right. These are just a few of my favourites. If you need more, just let me know. Thank you so much. That is so generous. Thank you, really. Yeah. You're welcome. If there's anything else I can do... Uh, I think we've pretty much got it covered, but thank you again for this, really. Um, I'm happy to help. I'll see you later, then. You bet. Cool. You know, I'm starving. You want something to eat? Sure. After you. Still a lot of work to be done, but, you know, it gets the job done. Plus, it's a short commute to work. I always thought you were gonna build your own place, so this makes sense. Actually, I have my eyes on 100 acres by the lake, but when things went south at the cafe a few years ago, this just felt right. Yeah, that must have been hard. No. Turns out, I love it up here. Did you ever consider... doing anything else? Sure. I thought about it. But...? Well, this is my home. You know, leaving just... didn't feel right. What about marriage and kids and all that? You ever get close? No. But I'm sure you must have dated, right? Are we really having the "who's dating who" conversation? I'm just saying... I'm sure every single lady in 100 miles from here is just chomping at the bit. Okay, that is not true. There's at least one. Sam... Marina's a nice girl. She lives in town, she's super successful. I'm thirsty. You want some eggnog or something? All right, nice left turn there, buddy. I see what you're doing. Just grab the coffee mugs, will you? The Christmas ones are under the coffee table. Aye-aye, captain. Cute. Of all the Christmas trees you have outside, this is the one you choose? I like it. Yeah, me too. Noah? Noah: Yeah. What's this? "N&S?" Like "Noah and Sam"? Yeah, I guess. Why haven't I seen this before? 'Cause I never had the chance to give it to you. And you kept it? All this time? Yeah. Why? I don't know. You don't know? What do you want me to say, Sam? You said we were water under the bridge. Well, I lied. We'd better get back. We got a lot to do tonight still, so... Right. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. This'll be ready in just a sec. I just gotta warm it up. Bob: Sammy, where do you want the trees? We're gonna stack 'em outside and when you're done-- I'll string up the lights. Thank you. What? The whole town pitched in. And one more! Great. Sammy, here are the wreaths. Oh! Mother of the year award... No way. Hi! Tessa, you made this? Yes! I haven't painted anything since high school and I have to say, it was so much fun! Kids are gonna love it. Thank you. Where did this come from? An anonymous donor. That is so generous! Well, you got friends in high places, Sam! That's a pretty generous donor. It's just a few turkeys. Right. Okay, let's get this off before the ice cream melts. There's ice cream in there? Oh, yeah. Oh, merry Christmas. Okay, on your way in, grab a shopping basket. there'll be someone to greet you at every station. Kids can have a visit with Santa and take a present, and on your way out, don't forget to pick up a tree out back. Thank you, everyone, and welcome to The Heart of the Holidays. Come on in, guys. Okay, now, watch your step here. Carol-Anne, thank you so much for your help tonight. Oh, it was my pleasure. Honestly... I actually had a really good time tonight. Yay! And that's not always the case at events like this. So, thank you for making it so special. Oh, please don't thank me. What you do, day-in and day-out for this community, that's the real work. This was just-- Giving people hope? Maybe. Mm-hmm. It's too bad we can't hand out jobs at the food bank. I am working on it. What I wish is that I had someone like you helping me out fulltime. We could really make an impact around here. Anyways, I'd better-- Hit the road. You know me so well. Night. Goodnight. Bye. Night-night. You're really something, you know that? Ahh, come on. No, no. I mean it. What you did tonight... Will: Sam? Will? What are you doing here? I left you a bunch of messages. Yeah, I was busy-- I see that. Hi. I'm Will. I know who you are. That's funny because I've never heard of you. Will, come on. Hey, Sam, what's going on? Hi. You must be Tammy. I'm Will. It's so nice to meet you. Oh, hi! Hi. I didn't know you were coming. I'm sorry we had to meet like this. I needed to talk to Sam and after the whole work fiasco, I felt like I had to do this in person. Oh. What work fiasco? Maybe this isn't the best place for this conversation. Who are you exactly? Stop. What is it, Will? When we first met, you told me you moved to New York to save the world. I told you that? Yeah, you did. So, I made some calls and it turns out that an old family friend's the acting director of American Health United. I told him about you and there's an opening, if you want it. Really? Absolutely. There's just one thing, he wants to interview you tomorrow. What? Will: I'm sure it's more of a formality, but they do wanna fill the position before the new year, so... Sam, I know you and this job is a perfect fit. You can start over, do what you came to New York to do. Consider it me trying to make up for everything. He's right. You should go. What? Sam, you deserve this. It's what you always wanted. Will: Give me the word and I'll lock it in. I just need a minute, okay? Noah... we have to talk about this. What is there to talk about, Sam? You have to go. I don't. I don't have to do anything. But you want to. What do you want? I want you to stay. I want to start over. But you and I both know you can't do that right now... ...not until you see what this job's all about, and I'm not going to stand in the way of that, Sam. No, Noah... It's okay. Not my first rodeo. Good luck. You're gonna be great. Will: So... am I making the call? Good morning. Mom... I'm so sorry about all of this. You don't have apologize. I'm just sorry you felt like you couldn't tell me. I wanted to tell you. I just wanted to have it all figured out first. Oh, Sammy... I should have never quit without a plan and now I'm leaving you alone on Christmas Eve. Sam... look at me. You have to go see what this job is all about, everybody knows that. And I know I always say that you are your father's daughter, and you are, but you're also different. Your dad worked extremely hard. Being successful was important to him and he achieved a lot. But it came at a price. He denied himself the time to explore other passions. But you... you have both. You work hard and you follow your heart, and that's what makes you so special, and I like to think that you get a little of that from me. Thank you, Mom... ...for all of it. Okay. You got to get going. I guess so. Okay... Oh. For the road. Sam? Yes? Hi. Thanks for waiting. Oh, thank you for seeing me on such short notice. I really appreciate it. Oh, it's my pleasure. I'm happy to put a face to the name that Will speaks so highly of. So, should we dive right in? Yes, let's. Listen, we have a management position open in our fundraising department. Now, it's not quite as senior as you're used to, but there's certainly room to grow if you're interested. You'd be a great fit. I realize it's not exactly a boots on the ground type of job, but it is one of the most critical aspects of our work here. Nothing else gets done, unless we can raise the capital, and with your extensive knowledge of the business world... ...you'd be a huge asset to us. When I was younger, I had different aspirations and working for AAU was it - an organization out there on the ground, fighting for people's basic needs and human rights. If my time in finance taught me anything, it's that throwing money at a problem is only part of the solution. People need more, in my opinion. They need real opportunities to succeed. They need... hope. They need to know that there's a better life out there for them and they need to be given the chance to achieve it. Well, it's clear Will was right. We'd be very lucky to have you. Hi. Hey, how'd it go with Ray? So, I pulled a few strings and got a dinner reservation at Topaz tonight to celebrate. Will-- Or we can just order sushi, whatever you want. I want to thank you for arranging the interview with Ray. I really appreciate it. It was such a huge opportunity. You're not gonna take it. Don't tell me this is about that guy at the food bank. Well, the person that I was while we were together, it wasn't the real me. I didn't know who I was. I didn't know what I wanted. What do you want? I want to go home. Well, drive safe. Merry Christmas, Will. Merry Christmas, Sam. Surprise! Surprise! What are you two doing here? Well, we've come to spend Christmas with our friend. Oh, Val, you didn't have to do that. Oh, nonsense! Of course we did. So, let's get this casserole in the oven, shall we? I'm starving! Tammy: Mmm, delicious. Thanks. Guys? Just throw it in for 30 minutes at 350. Oh, by the way, guess who I saw chatting... Guys? ...at the bus stop today. Who? Marina and Jeremy. You know, the really cute mechanic from Al's garage? Oh, right! Yeah! Guys... What is it, Bob? I think we'd better set that table for four. Hi, Mom. S-Sammy... What are you doing here? I'm moving home. What about the job? You know, it wasn't for me. Turns out, I want to live in Crawleigh, closer to you, closer to everyone... ...and get involved in community and help wherever I can. And I never, ever want to miss another Christmas. Oh, welcome home, Sammy. Hello? Oh! I knew it! It's a girl! Tessa, congratulations! Yeah. Yeah, no, it's her. She's here. She's moving home. Okay, sweetie, we'll let you go. Merry Christmas, kiddo. Aww, isn't that fabulous? Aww... Okay, well, everyone, if you don't mind, there's one more thing I have to do. You go get him, honey. Okay. I'll be back, promise. Yes. Yes! Go get who? Seriously? Oh... Carol-Anne. Hey, Sam. What are you doing here? I'm looking for Noah. Have you seen him? Oh, you just missed him. He was here all day cleaning up. I just came to lock up. Oh. Okay. Hey, I thought you left for New York. I did. I'm back... for good. Really? That's wonderful. Oh, so, if you're serious about needing fulltime help-- Uh, I would love that. Let's talk first thing in the new year. Great! Oh! Carol-Anne... Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Hi. Hi. You weren't going to go in? No. I didn't wanna bother anybody. And I still have a few more stops to make, so... Is that really what you're doing? On Christmas? Running errands? Pretty much. Noah... How'd it go in New York? It's not gonna work out in New York. I'm sorry to hear that. Oh, no. Don't be. I made the decision. I'm moving home, Noah. Not with my mom, although, I'm sure she would love that. Uh... no. I was thinking... more like a really nice house on a lake, with a really nice attic. I don't know, maybe Val could help me find something. I'm sure she could. You know, I've had a lot of time to think and... I realized that I have been so desperate to live up to this idea of success that I had, that... I completely lost sight of myself and what really, really makes me happy. And... this past week with you... ...I remembered. I remembered what it felt like to be part of a community. I remembered what it felt like to actually make a difference in people's lives, even for a night. And I remembered what it felt like to love you. I love you, Noah, I always have. And I just really hope it's not too late to tell you that. It's not too late. Okay, good because I didn't have a plan if you'd said no. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Go on, go, Bob. Go, go. Go, go. I love you, too. Welcome home.
