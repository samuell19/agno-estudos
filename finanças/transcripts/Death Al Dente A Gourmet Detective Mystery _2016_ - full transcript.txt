Call him back in, Joe. I'd like to go over his statement one more time, if that's okay. Yeah. Thanks. Price, just heard from the d.A. Da silva got sentenced to 55 years, no parole. Looks like another win for you. You mean for us. Hey, you made us all look good. Okay... what do you need? What? I'm just trying to congratulate you. Okay, look, I've been trying to date this really beautiful girl for, like, a couple of months now, and she's finally said yes, but she's only available tonight... in an hour. Oh, god, munro! Somebody canceled on her last minute, and you're the back-up guy. I know! I'm okay with that. Can you cover for me? I am wearing my coat, holding my car keys, and walking to the door. Does it look like I can cover for you? Come on, just this one time. You said that last time. Look, tonight, my mom is making a roast, and I swore to her that I would be home by 6:30 and now, because I am standing here, talking to you, I'm already running late, so... no... And you know what? You deserve to be somebody's first choice, munro. You do. Hey, price, could you just tell me... Tomorrow. No, just saying, maybe you could... Let the woman walk out the door, people. Thank you. 'Night. At least bring some leftovers! Hi, guys! Mm! The house smells so good! Hi, honey. How was work? What are you doing in my house? Henry's teaching me a new recipe. We are having crown lamb roast, with wild mushroom, roasted potatoes, mixed vegetables, stuffing... With red-wine reduction. You don't look happy to see me. I just wasn't expecting company. What about company that brings good wine? Getting happier by the second. I will pour you a glass. Thank you. Where's Abby? She did her homework. I told her she could go get burgers with some friends. Again? My 14-year-old has a better social life than I do. Well, that wouldn't be hard, dear. I don't know what we're going to do for dessert. That mess was supposed to be a meringue. Well, I'll tell you what. I am going to a party later this evening. Friends of mine won "restaurant of the year" award, and they're celebrating. It's at carmella's. Oh, I know that place. Well, you two should join me. I wish I could, but I have to read the last chapter of a book for book club tomorrow. Didn't you just say you started that book this morning, mom? Well, yes, but it's easier to fake it when I know how it ends... But you two go. I... don't know. It's a work night. Didn't you just swear to me last week you were going to start to say yes to things? I've had their panna cotta. Oh, isn't their panna cotta the best? I mean, seriously... Okay, okay. If it'll get you two to stop, I'll go. You're welcome. Oh, yeah, of course, I remember this place. Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. It's been around for 70 years. Well, thank you for the invite. It's actually nice to get out. My pleasure. Henry Ross, right? Yes. I recognize you from your blog. My ex-girlfriend was obsessed with it. Mateo durand. Ah, you're the new chef. I've heard great things about you. This is my friend, Maggie price. How do you do? So, Mateo... You were the sous-chef over at villa al fresco before joining Leo here, right? I don't know how you knew that. I don't know, I guess it's my job to know stuff like that. I am a consultant in the food industry. As he loves to remind me. Well, congratulations on the award. I'm sure that the changes you've made to the menu here had something to do with that. Now, do me a favor and tell Leo that. Oh, I think you've told me that yourself enough times, Mateo. Henry, I'm so glad you could make it. Oh, it's so great to see you, too. This is my friend, Maggie price. This is Claudia and Leo. They're the owners and longtime friends. Chef? Things are backing up in the kitchen. Thanks, dom, I'll be right there. If you'll excuse me. Of course. I need to make sure everyone's drinks are being refilled, so enjoy yourselves, and save room for dessert. It was nice meeting you, Maggie. You as well. You know, I think I'm going to go check on Abby quickly. I'll be right back. All right. So... Things not going so well with the new chef? Yeah... Yeah, you could say that. Well, I'm sure your grandmother would be very proud of all that you've accomplished. My grandmother would wonder why it took us so long. Okay, honey. Just make sure you're home by 9:00. I'll see you when I get in. Love you. Come on! No, we're not discussing this anymore! Claud, wait! Enough. I said you need to stop this. So, Maggie, what do you do? I'm a detective with the sfpd. - Are you? - Mm-hmm. You know, something happened here last week, that the police aren't taking very seriously. Really? What happened? Somebody broke in. I came down the stairs, and he took off. You're kidding. Did he take anything? No. Nothing's missing. Hmm. Did you get a look at him? Yeah, he was wearing a ski mask, like a bank robber. He was tall. He was wearing jeans and a dark sweatshirt. And red sneakers. You know, even in the moment, I remember thinking... "How stupid is this guy?" I mean, he wants to be incognito and he's wearing red sneakers. What did the police say? Oh, not much. They told me to get my alarm system fixed, and they asked a few questions, and then they left. And the weird part is, he was in the pantry. I don't know what he was expecting to find in there. We have petty cash in a money box in the office, and it wasn't even touched. What do you think? Well, I think it's time to get your alarm system fixed. Beyond that, I'm afraid I can't be of much help. Break-ins aren't my jurisdiction. I'm in homicide. Well, then I certainly hope we won't be needing your services any time soon. Definitely not. Well, thank you. That was fun. Yeah? Yeah. You know... I get invited to this kind of thing all the time, so consider it a standing offer to join me. Thanks. I... Appreciate the standing offer. Well... Goodnight. Goodnight. Drive safe. Okay. Hey, baby, sorry. I didn't mean to wake you up. It's okay. Did you have fun? I did. Did you? Where'd you guys go? Goodnight. I love you. Is everything okay? Yeah. Well, are you coming upstairs? No, not just yet. Can I have one of those? Sure. Cheers. To Mateo... Our master chef. I was going to say "to us." Were you? Leo, please don't start. I see the way he looks at you. Sometimes, I think I see you looking at him the same way. Well then, you see things. Look, if you don't like having Mateo around, fire him. Hire a new chef. He's the reason we won this award, Claudia. I can't fire him. Well, that's up to you... But either get rid of him, or stop accusing me of whatever it is you're accusing me of. I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Morning, sweetie. Do you want peanut butter? Plain is fine, thanks. You look pretty today. Thank you. Cute hair. Who's the boy? - What? - Hmm? Oh... Somehow, the glitter from your body spray seems to have migrated up to your eyelids. Mom... I'm just trying to make sure he's not a senior with a motorcycle. Ew. He's a freshman with a skateboard. Oh! Well, I am still doing a background check on his entire family. No need. He doesn't even know I exist. How can he not? Look at you... And this is not a face that needs makeup. Or is allowed to wear it. Detective price. What? You've got to be kidding me. What happened? Looks like a b&e gone bad. The wife, um... Claudia. Claudia, yeah. She came back from a run this morning around quarter to 7:00 and found Leo lying on the kitchen floor where he'd been shot. He hit his head on the counter, was knocked out. How's he doing now? I just got off the phone with a nurse from St. Josephine's hospital. He's in a coma. God, I can't believe this. We were just here last night. Leo was telling me about a break-in that happened last week, but he scared the guy off. Guess the guy came back to finish off the job. At 7:00 in the morning? Doesn't that seem like a pretty unusual time for a break-in? Do we know yet if anything's missing? Claudia was pretty hysterical when the first responders arrived, but she did let us into the office to check. $2,000 was taken from the petty cash box that they kept in the desk. She hadn't had a chance to put it in the bank yet. The guy must have known it was there. I know that look. Your spidey senses tingling, price? So somebody breaks in a week ago, searches around in the pantry, but doesn't take anything, gets interrupted and runs, then comes back a week later with a gun, takes some cash, gets interrupted by Leo again, and shoots him? Mm. Well, when you lay it out like that, it does seem a little strange. Yeah. Until we know what we're dealing with here, I going to treat this as an attempted homicide. Get forensics over here. I need to get to the hospital. I'm going to get a statement from Claudia. You keep canvassing the neighborhood. Somebody had to have seen something. You got it. And make sure that everybody who works here goes down to the station for interviews. I've got to call Henry. Henry? Yeah, he was here with me last night. He knows the trivianos personally. Maybe he can help us. Claudia, I am so, so sorry. Why would somebody do this to Leo? It doesn't make any sense. I know. I'm sorry, Claudia, just a few more questions, okay? Do you remember if you locked the door behind you when you left? I didn't. How could I have been so stupid after the first break-in? Because it was 7:00 in the morning and perfectly understandable that you didn't lock your door. Can you think of anyone who would want to harm Leo? Leo was the last person anyone would want to hurt. I just... I can't imagine. Are we done? I'd really like to go sit with him. Yeah. Go ahead. These were in the same desk where the cash was taken. Untouched... And they look real. There's no sign of forced entry back here, which means that whoever broke in last week probably had a key. The neighbors didn't hear anything this morning? One woman across the street said she heard what she thought was a car backfiring at 7:30. It's nice that some people in the world can hear a gun go off and still think it's a car back-firing. People really need to be more paranoid. Yeah. I found something. That painting of carmella might be worth a lot of money. Why's that? Interesting story, actually. The painter is a local artist who lived in obscurity until his 90s, when some of his work was selected for the oval office. His popularity sky-rocketed, and he lived to see it, which, of course, a lot of artists don't. Actually, did you know that... I know that there's a point coming. That painting must be worth well over a hundred grand. Why didn't whoever robbed the place take the painting? Because nobody knows anything about art. I've seen paintings hanging in museums that my four-year-old niece could have done. What are you doing here? I'm investigating a b&e. I mean, what are you doing in San Francisco? You're supposed to be in Florida. Oh, well, it turns out I hate humidity, so I'm back at the north beach division. Since when? Couple months. Oh... Uh, Steve... Sorry, this is detective Steve Miller. This is Henry Ross, and you remember Bailey and munro. Well, welcome back to San Francisco, but this isn't your case. It's in my division. Uh, no, actually. You handle everything west of valencia street, and this is on the border, and I'm pretty sure it says in the handbook that we handle everything that's on the border. Whoa, there's a handbook? There is no handbook. Sure, there's a handbook. In fact, it's the one that stipulates I handle all the rinky-dink crimes like robberies, and fancy-pants special units people like you do the homicides. There are extenuating circumstances here. Meaning? Meaning I am treating this case as an attempted murder, and it's nice to see that you still haven't gotten over the fact that I got promoted before you. I haven't gotten over a lot of things. Well, looks like we're going to be teaming up, guys. That's a terrible idea. You know, Maggie is very possessive of her murder cases. What do you say, mags? Things worked pretty well for us in the past. Is that something we even do? Team up with other divisions? Sometimes. Fine. Let's pool our resources on this one... For now. Done. Great. So we'll start in here, and you can start in the dining room. No, I mean, I'm done. I've already gone through the place. You've tampered with my crime scene? I started investigating my crime scene, yeah. Did you want to see what I found? I got it out of the office in the shredder. Haven't had a chance to tape it back together yet, but... Well, Bailey and munro can handle that. All right, then, as long as I get to come with you. Fine. This is going to be fun. Are you kidding me? I didn't go to the academy so I could sit here and do puzzles. Come on, man. Between the two of us, this is going to take, like, five minutes. We just need to figure out where to start. Who is that guy? Oh, that's, um... He consults for us. Since when does the department afford consultants? He's very good, actually. He helped me solve two cases. Well, he doesn't look like a detective. He's, um... Yeah, it's a long story. Get the tape, make sure it's straight... How's it going, guys? Since when do you drink our coffee? Yeah. I, uh, I was just, um... Ah... I got it. Spying. Now, hey, I was not spying. Okay, sure. Yup, yup. Guys need any help? Good luck. Whoever wrote this wrote on both sides of the paper. See? Well... Why don't you follow the watermark? Huh? Yeah, you see how one side is shiny and the other side isn't? That's the watermark. Well, I'll be... That is some Sherlock Holmes stuff right there, man. Look, this shouldn't be that hard. I don't want to step on any toes here, but... Mind if I give it a try? Absolutely. Go right ahead. Yeah, yeah, knock yourself out. - Yep. Yup, yup. - Take your time. Thanks, guys. All right! Okay, let me get you caught up to speed here. This is the owner, Leo triviano, his wife, Claudia, and their chef, Mateo durand. This is dom. Now, this is Claudia's nephew. He is... You look good. Have I mentioned you look good? Um... Sous-chef. No, you haven't. You do. Dom is, uh, Claudia's, um... Nephew. Yeah, you said that part. Right. Okay. I was going to call. I mean, really, I picked up the phone, like, 10 times, but I just didn't know what to say. Well, you could have started by explaining why you left without saying goodbye. Come on, mags. I mean, you were busy picking up the pieces your ex left when he walked out. I didn't want to be the rebound guy... And I did say goodbye, for the record. Yes, that was a beautiful text. Didn't handle it as well as I could have. After six months together, not to mention the four years back in college? No, you didn't handle it as well as you could have. Because if I came to say goodbye in person... I wasn't sure I was going to be able to leave. All done. Wow. That was fast. Well, it was a little complicated, but I like complicated. Maybe you should be consulting for the CIA. I like working here. So it's a letter? Yes, it's from Leo's grandmother, carmella, to her sister, Vera. "Dear Vera, the sun rarely breaks through the fog here, and I miss our life back home. Fausto is no longer the kind man I married, and I feel trapped and alone and miss you all terribly. I keep our family legacy close to my heart. It is all I have left to remember you by. Your letters bring me so much joy. Please write again soon. Your loving sister, carmella." Sounds like a typical letter between sisters. If a little sappy. She was lonely and wanted her sister to write. You know, some people actually appreciate the odd email... Letter! Okay, so... Carmella wasn't happy in her marriage, but this was decades ago, and she's been gone for a long time, so why shred the letter now? Because it contains something important. That's brilliant. How much does the department pay you, exactly? I agree. It's important. It goes on the board for now. Does anybody have anything else? How about Sara Jennings? Who's Sara Jennings? She's a silent investor at carmella's, along with several other restaurants in town. I'm sure she could give us some information. Great! Let's call her in for an interview. All right. And to answer your question... Not enough. Code blue, 425! Code blue team to ward g. Code blue team to ward g. He's in arrest. Give him one cc of epi. Hang on, Mr. Triviano. Hey. I just went home to shower. I thought I could leave Leo for an hour. I can't believe he's gone. Henry, I... What? What is it? We had a fight last night. I didn't wait up for him. I was too upset... And now, those are the last words I'll ever say to him. No, Claudia. Come here. Don't do that to yourself. Listen, um... I have to ask you a question, and I know that this is horrible timing... But we found something at the restaurant. Carmella wrote this letter to her sister in 1944. Do you have any idea how this ended up back in the states? You have to ask me about this now? No, I know... But I think this might be important. How? I don't know yet. We just went to Italy a few months ago to see Vera because she wasn't doing well. She passed while we were there, and Leo brought back a box of things, things Vera treasured... Letters, photographs... I guess this could have been in there. Do you know why someone might want to destroy this letter? No. Nolan? Ah, detective price. I didn't know you were coming by. I have a medical question to run by you, and I might need a favor. Am I interrupting? No, not at all. Please, come on in. You see this paperwork? This is the worst part of my job. Now, that's saying something. How can I help you? I need to know how common it is for someone in a coma to have a heart attack. Well, it happens. How frequently? Was the patient under some stress? He was shot in the stomach, hit his head, and fell into a coma en route to the hospital. Okay, well, given that kind of trauma, cardiac arrest is a definite possibility. Still... I got a hunch on this one. Is this the part where you ask me for a favor? I need an autopsy. The name is Leo triviano. Okay, what are we looking for? Anything that could have caused a heart attack. Any chemicals in his system, maybe an embolism... I will get on it right away. Thanks. You're the best. I know, and you owe me. I always do. You know, we should take a closer look at Mateo. Leo didn't like him. Why's that? Claudia told me once that they always fought over the menu. Mateo wanted to change everything, and Leo wanted to stick with tradition. Mm, good to know. That's what I'm here for. Yeah, also, maybe Leo knew that there was something going on between Mateo and his wife. What? They were arguing in the office during the party. Why didn't you tell me that before? Well, I'm telling you now. I don't know exactly what's going on, but I think those two are more than just colleagues. Hey! I was just checking up on our case. I'm sorry to hear about Leo. Yeah. You think we're looking at a homicide? Well, the guy's place gets broken into twice, he's shot, and then suddenly passes away from a heart attack? I think that's one too many coincidences in a row, so we're going to treat this as a homicide. And since that's our division... We'll take it from here. Okay, then I will leave you to your case. If you think of anything, call me. "Call me?" Seriously? He's a very good detective, Henry. Uh-huh. How long did you two date? Boundaries? Don't have any. Look, was he before or after your ex-husband, hmm? Come on. You know I can do this all day. Before and after. Really? Yeah. We dated in college and at the academy, and then when I met Richard, I broke up with Steve... And when Richard left, Steve was your shoulder to cry on. He has pretty nice shoulders. Well, you can't blame the guy for taking advantage of the situation. No, it wasn't like that. We were just friends. And then? And then things progressed, because you know what, it felt nice to have somebody be there for me when I had just had my heart broken into a million little pieces, and why am I even telling you any of this? Because I'm a good listener. No, because you're nosy. Not the same thing. Maggie? Sara Jennings is in the conference room, like you asked. Oh, great, thanks. To be continued. No, not to be continued! Can we please just stick to talking about the case? Hey, do you want to come in with me? That's a good idea! I know Sara well. You know what? Why don't I lead the interview? No-no-no, you're not going to talk about the case. You just said stick to... With me, yes. Not with her. With her, you have to make her feel comfortable. You just have to be your charming self, and maybe she'll open up. I can be charming. On second thought... Watch and learn. I just can't believe Leo's dead... And Henry, what do you have to do with this? I consult with the department sometimes. They bring me in whenever there's a murder involving food or... A murder? Leo was murdered? We don't know anything yet. We're just taking a closer look because there are some suspicious circumstances surrounding Leo's death. Like what? Well, to begin with, there... We're not at liberty to say right now. Right! Right. I suggested that Maggie bring you in to simply talk with you. Sara, I hate the circumstances, but, um... I've got to admit, it's good seeing you again. I haven't seen you since that wine festival. In San Marino. I remember. That was a, um... Good weekend. Yeah. I mean, the wine... Was excellent... And the views. I could get used to that view. Well, I'm jealous. I wish I had a job where I got to go on wine-tasting weekends. Was that part of your role as Leo's silent partner? Not exactly. Wine tasting's just a hobby. And how was it? Working with Leo? Good. I mean, he could be opinionated, but it was just because he was passionate about cooking and upholding his family's legacy, that's all. Do you think Leo might have had any enemies? I can't imagine. And where were you this morning between 7:00 and 8:00 A.M.? The same place I am every morning, on a yoga mat in the studio in the bowery. I'm going to need the name of the studio. Sure, of course. Listen, I know you need to look at everyone as a suspect, but I stand to lose, and lose big from Leo's death, okay? Who's going to want to eat at a place where the owner was gunned down in his own kitchen? All the loyalty carmella's has built up over 70 years is going to vanish overnight, you watch. Even if, by some miracle, we stay in business, we'll never fully recover from this... And you know what? I liked Leo. I liked him a lot. Now, are we done here? Sure. We'll call you if we have any more questions. That's my new restaurant. Call me any time you want to come by, I'll make sure you get the best seat in the house. Okay. Well, she's charming. I always thought so. How was your working relationship with Leo? Was it a good one? Not really. I had to run every tiny little change by him. Do you have any idea what it's like to be micro-managed? What can you tell me about this guy? He's an up-and-comer in the food scene here in San Francisco. He was a sous-chef at a restaurant called villa al fresco. That's a... Yeah, I don't live under a rock, Henry. Villa al fresco is the hottest restaurant in town. Why would Mateo take a job at a smaller restaurant? Well, it's not easy getting hired as a head chef. It's very competitive, especially in this city. Leo took a chance on him, but he wouldn't let him take control of the kitchen, and that's one thing that caused an issue between them. How long have you been in love with Claudia? - What? - That's the second thing. You could've led with that. I don't know what you're talking about. Come on, Mateo. I saw you two arguing at the party. Claud, wait! Enough. I said you need to stop this. What were you fighting about? Nothing. Work stuff. Look, you'd save us both a lot of time by just admitting to an affair right now. There's nothing to admit to. Okay. Then why don't you tell me where you were when Leo was shot? Sure. I was in bed... asleep. Can anyone corroborate that? Nope. I was alone. Leo was training me to be a chef. He didn't like having someone outside of the family running the kitchen. And where were you this morning, when Leo was shot? I was eating breakfast at home, alone. Were you online, on any social media? Yeah, sure, I was on Facebook, maybe. On what device? My phone. Great. Do you have that with you? - Yeah. - I'd love to see it. Thank you. Your location services are enabled. That's good news for you if you never left your apartment this morning. I see you posted a picture of your breakfast, which looks delicious, by the way, at 7:15 A.M. from home. Okay, how long does it take you to get to work? Well, I live in Oakland. It takes me 40 minutes to get to work. Earlier today around noon, were you anywhere near the hospital? No. I was going to visit Leo later in the day. At noon, I was still in Oakland, at a taco stand on fruitvale. I'm a regular customer. They should remember me. Just a few more questions. How long ago did you start working for Claudia and Leo? Uh, about six months ago. That was right after you moved to San Francisco from New Jersey. Yeah, they gave me a job right away, no questions asked. I couldn't believe it. Why? Because I didn't know them too well. Aunt Claudia and my dad don't speak. See, she was... Ashamed of my dad. He spent some time in prison. Frank brenetti. Dom's father, Claudia's brother. Did eight years in lock-up for armed robbery. He was disciplined several times inside. When did he get out? A couple of weeks ago. Interesting timing. Mm-hmm. We're trying to locate him. Look at this. "I keep our family legacy close to my heart." Sara said the word "legacy" when we talked to her. That's right, she did. "Close to my heart." What does that even mean? A reputation? You wouldn't keep a reputation close to your heart. Maybe her english wasn't perfect. Maybe she meant family memories. Then why shred the letter? What if "legacy" meant something tangible? Like... a will? Or valuables. It was 1944. People were smuggling all kinds of things out of Europe to keep them safe. Like family jewels. Yes, and that's what whoever broke into Leo's place was looking for. And when he didn't find them, killed Leo... Or tried to. Claudia came home from her run and interrupted them, but Leo had already seen his face, so whoever the guy was had to go back to the hospital to finish the job. That's a pretty good theory. Yeah. Claudia had seen the letter, too. I could tell when I showed it to her at the hospital. What? Yeah, I mean, she covered, but her hands were shaking when I showed it to her. No, no, no, wait. Back up. You're sharing evidence with suspects? Bad move? Yeah, bad move. Yeah, okay. Okay, I can see that now. That... my bad. Oh, good. Listen, um... Bailey and munro are going to be back any minute, so why don't you guys start running down alibis together? W-What, you want to split up? I... I just have to follow up on something. Where are you going? I will meet you back here. Why don't you start by confirming that Sara was at the yoga studio like she said? She's no murderer. I would know. Yes, you're close. We got that part. Check up on her alibi anyway. She seem a little jealous to you? Keep trying. Thank you for coming. Yeah, of course. Your text said it was urgent. It is. I found a lead. Oh, really? Come here, I'll show you. Look at this. It's been broken into, okay? But somebody also dragged it across the floor. You can see the drag marks. So, did you look through it? Yeah. It's... A bunch of old papers. Nothing of any value, as far as I can tell. Hmm. So whoever broke in here ignored the cash in the office because they were looking for something else. Exactly. Which... I already knew. Oh... one step ahead of me. Just like old times. If you wanted to relive old times, you could have just asked me for a coffee. Wait, wait, wait, I've been downgraded to coffee? I thought we were thinking about dinner. - Dinner? - What do you say? I... Detective price. Well, you were right. I found damage caused by an air embolism in Leo's heart. What are the odds of that happening naturally? Next to none. So Leo was murdered. My professional opinion is that someone had to have injected air into Leo's veins and caused a heart attack. I appreciate your help. Thanks, Nolan. I have to get back to the hospital. You want some company? Uh, no, but thanks for luring me here under false pretenses. Any time. I checked up on Sara's alibi. She was at the yoga studio like she said. Hmm, good to know. She's still not off the hook. Are you a little jealous? Please. Hi. Detective price, you're back. Yes, we are. We have some more questions for you, if you have a moment. Of course. Do you have any security cameras set up on this floor? No, the only cameras we have are at the main entrance of the hospital. We need to know who had access to this floor. It's an open floor. People are coming and going all day long. Well, that narrows it down. All right. That's all for now. - Thank you. - Thank you. Excuse me? You the police? Yes, sir. I'm detective Maggie price. We're just looking into the death of the gentleman who passed away down the hall. I was sitting right here when it happened. Were you? Did you happen to notice anything unusual? Did anybody go into his room? A nurse went in there with a tray. Left quickly. A nurse? Can you tell us what she looked like? Sure, only it wasn't a she. It was a he. A man? Are you sure? It was definitely a man. Thanks. Thanks a lot. I brought you a latte. Thank you. So, I talked to the head nurse again this morning. She said that the last time a nurse went into Leo's room was at 12:15 to check on him. His alarm started going off at 12:45. She also confirmed that there are no male nurses that work on Leo's floor, and that there would be no reason for a nurse from another floor to ever enter Leo's room. Okay, so... A guy takes the risk of going into Leo's room in the middle of the day in a busy hospital to kill him. Exactly. For someone to take that kind of a risk, he must have had a pretty compelling reason for wanting Leo dead. I'd like to go by and talk to Claudia again. Oh, please... Is this guy for real? Who? Detective Steve. You're stalking him on Facebook? Who uses a surfing picture as their profile pic? People who know how to surf... And who look pretty good doing it. Why'd you two break up? Stop prying. I'm just trying to save you another bad ending. What does that mean? Surfer dude here is not a guy who's in it for the long haul. Ho ho, says the guy who's never been married. Exactly, because I don't take commitment lightly. That's the perfect cover for a commitment-phobe. No, not at all. I just want to do it once, and I want to do it right. Hmm. Yeah, well, don't we all, okay? But you can't control how others behave. Maybe not, but you can save yourself a lot of heartache by choosing the right guy in the first place, and this guy? This is adventure guy. This is fun guy. This is also bail-at-the-first-sign of-trouble guy. How do you know that? Because I used to be that guy. Really? Some people grow up and some people don't. Look, I'm just looking out for you. I saw something when we were at the party. You and Mateo. You were arguing. Mateo's been unhappy. He felt Leo didn't appreciate everything he's done for our restaurant. He was threatening to quit. I felt he wasn't being very loyal, and I got angry. Is there... any more to it? What do you mean? I mean, your argument seemed a bit more intimate than that. Are you asking me if Mateo and I are having an affair? No. We're not. My husband was the one with the gorgeous, flirtatious business partner. We're already looking into Sara Jennings. So you should. She owns half the business. And now you own the other half. I guess you're right. I inherit half of the restaurant and all of Leo's debts. He took out a huge loan recently to upgrade the kitchens. You understand how tight the margins are in the restaurant business, Henry... How fickle it is. It's not like losing my husband is going to make me rich. You saw how fast she pointed us towards Sara. I'm telling you, Claudia's hiding something. As for dom's story, checked out the taco stand in Oakland. They get a huge lunch crowd. No one could confirm that he was there. I still say Mateo is our guy. He had a key to the restaurant, and if he and Claudia were close enough, maybe he knew about the letter. Wait a minute. If the legacy is referring to something tangible, like jewels, what if there's a clue inside this letter telling us where they're hidden? So now the letter is a treasure map. Exactly! I love that. What are you, one of the Hardy boys? Hey, the Hardy boys solved every case. That's totally true, yeah. Oh, wow. Ha... Well, hello, detective. You got another bogus lead for me already? That was fast. Well, I'm going to have to think about that. Okay. Yes to dinner, no to your place, because I remember your cooking. Fine. 8:00. Okay, I'll see you there. Bye. Wow... Your eavesdropping skills could use a little work. You're going out with him? I have already heard your opinion on this, - so spare me... - I am not... Because it's just a dinner, okay? - Okay. - Okay... Although would it be so bad if it were a date? Because, you know, I hear that's a thing that people do, they go out. They have fun. My mom has a great social life, Abby's never home that much anymore, and maybe I don't want to spend the rest of my life at home alone with my cats. You don't have cats. Well, not yet. Guess what? We may have just found our motive. Sara Jennings had key man insurance on Leo. What's that? That is when a company takes out insurance on someone they consider key to their success. Leo was the head chef at his restaurant for many years before he hired Mateo to take over. So if Leo's no longer chef, why have insurance on him? I don't know. And you never mentioned this before because...? It didn't occur to me. But secret clues hidden in a letter did? This key man insurance was pretty hefty. With Leo's death, Sara was about to receive quite a payout. How big? One million dollars big. Henry... Call Sara up, and see if you can take her out tonight. What? Just consider it a field assignment, you know. Get close to her, see what you can find out. I don't think that's a great idea. Henry can't do that. He's never done that. I don't know, from everything I've seen so far, I disagree. Really? Call her up. Okay, I will. Okay. Sara? Hi, it's Henry. Listen, I know this may sound strange under the circumstances, but seeing you again the other day reminded me how much fun we had, so I was thinking... There's this new restaurant in the Castro that's... Yeah. Yeah, that's the one. How about I make us some reservations tonight for 8:00 P.M.? Okay. Looking forward to it. Bye-bye. And that's how that's done. Okay... Are you sure you've got this? Trust me. Okay, so what am I doing, exactly? Hello? Can I help you? Hey! Hey! Stop! So here I am, in the middle of nowhere in Costa Rica with my buddies on the surf trip. First night we check into the hotel, and everybody's wallet gets stolen. Cash, credit cards... Everything gone. Well, so what did you do? We slept for three nights on the beach until someone could wire us money. Wow. That sounds really uncomfortable. You know, actually, it turned out to be one of the best trips I ever took. So what about you? What have you been up to? Mm... nothing that can compare to that... But, um, life's good. You know, Abby's doing really well in school, and she's vice president of the student council... And already looking ahead to what colleges she wants to apply to, which is just... Scary. So scary. I swear, it was just yesterday I was dropping her off at kindergarten for the first day, you know? But I guess that's life, right? Things change. And yet, other things feel exactly the same. So how is the case going? The weirdest thing happened earlier tonight. There was this guy that was just lurking around in the underground parking lot at the precinct, and he was just staring at me. Who? I don't know. I couldn't see his face. He ran, so I chased him, but, um, I couldn't catch him... But the thing is... He was wearing red sneakers. We know whoever broke into Leo's restaurant was wearing red sneakers. Hmm... And even though I couldn't see his face, there was... Something about him that it just... Seemed familiar, and I couldn't help but think that maybe it was Mateo. I know Mateo's hiding something. Anyway, I'm going to circle back tomorrow. Well, why wait? What are you doing? I'm obviously not going to get any attention from you until you've cracked this case, so let's just box this up, and we'll go talk to Mateo. Right now? Yeah. Right now. Are you still trying to work your way into my case? For starters. I'm so glad you were free. I've been dying to see this menu. Thank you. Thank you very much. This looks great. Bon appetit. Thank you. - Mm. - Mm... The roasted garlic and the mushroom are blended well. How's yours? The black pepper adds a nice smokiness. It's great seeing you. You too. I'm glad things are going well for you. Truthfully, none of my restaurants are doing that great right now, and with Leo's death, well... Things have been better. But look at you! You're consulting for the police department. That's very impressive. Well, it's a fairly informal set-up. I mean, I like to think that I'm useful. And what's the deal with you and detective price? Oh, I just work with her sometimes. Mm-hmm. That's not what I meant. There's nothing going on between you two? Me and Maggie? Um... No. No, not at all. She's a very beautiful woman. Mm-hmm. Yes, she is, and she's smart, and she's very good at her job... I like to think that we genuinely can enjoy each other's company, but the woman thinks that she's right about everything. I mean, she cannot be wrong, and she treats me like I don't know what I'm talking about, and yet she constantly calls me, so what does that say? She obviously considers me a valuable asset but she would never admit that in a million years, and that is so Maggie. I mean... I'm sorry! You asked me a question. How about we get another drink? Can we have the wine list? Good idea. Thank you. Here, I'll let you. All right. Great. Now you can ask me what you've been waiting all evening to ask me. Which is what? About the key man insurance I have out on Leo. Come on, Henry, Leo's death could make me a million dollars richer. If I'm not your top suspect, I should be. Sara... Honestly, I still had the insurance 'cause I just forgot to cancel it after Leo hired a new chef, and I'm going to have a really hard time collecting, too, since Leo wasn't the chef when he died. He was the heart and soul of carmella's, but insurance companies don't pay out for a restaurant's heart and soul. I see. Now... Let me give you a little unsolicited advice about Maggie. No matter how tough and independent a woman is, she always appreciates it when a man has the guts to make the first move. Trust me... And don't wait too long. She'll think you're not man enough to step up to the plate. You know what I think? I think you're in love with Claudia, and you resented working for Leo. Really, he was holding you back in every way, so you decided to get rid of him. You shot him, and when he survived, you went to the hospital and murdered him. That's crazy. Okay, look... I do love her, okay? The truth is, she loved Leo. That's why she broke it off with me. She felt terrible about our affair. She didn't want to hurt Leo. I would never do anything to hurt her, okay, and that's why I wouldn't do anything to him. That's very noble of you. So where were you yesterday at 12:45? I was... out walking. Out walking? That's the best you got? I was pretty shaken up by Leo's shooting. Okay? I needed to clear my head, so I walked along the embarcadero. Did you talk to anyone? No. How'd you get there? The streetcar. Do you have your ticket stub? I think so. Yeah, see! Told ya. That's my alibi, right? Can I go now? Someone was lurking by my car earlier. Was it you? Nope. He banged his leg trying to get away. Do you mind rolling up your pant legs for me? Sure. Other one? See? Told you. Can I go now? Yeah, you can go. That was a fun evening. One for the books. So you want to go back to my place? Have a drink, talk about old times? I, um... Thanks, but I think I'm going to go home. Okay, how about this weekend? I can't. How about you name the date? I mean, I can't. Look, I came out tonight because I really wanted to see you, and it was great to see you, but... It's like you said. You know, things feel exactly the same. How is that a bad thing? Because I'm not the same. You and I make such a great team... At work... But you need adventure and excitement, and I need... Someone who loves my less-than-glamorous life as much as I do... And I love my life. I just... I'm looking for the right person to share it with, someone who's going to be in it for the long haul. Okay! Well, uh, that leaves me with not a lot left to say, for once. Take care of yourself. You, too. And I hear the part you're not telling me, loud and clear. What's that? Well, that you've already found Mr. Long haul. Come on, the consultant guy, the wannabe detective? Henry? No... it's not like that. Could've fooled me. It's not! I'll see you around. Bye. Hey, come on in. Thanks for coming. Of course. I just wanted to go over everything one more time. Okay. I brought you snacks. Oh, thanks! Although I'm not very hungry, I have to tell you. I just had a huge amount of... Ooh... Pretty! You know me too well. I know you that you eat more than most linebackers, but those are not all for you, okay? Where's Abby and your mom? At the movies. More for me. So catch me up. How was your night with Sara? Her businesses aren't doing that well, so she definitely needs money. Did you get a chance to ask her about the key man insurance? I... Managed to slip that in there. She said that since Leo wasn't the chef at the time of his death, she probably won't collect. We need to confirm that, but congratulations. First night in the field. How did it feel? Not bad. I knew you could do it. Listen, Maggie, I... I know, I'm sorry. It's late. Okay. Let's get to it. The question that keeps circling in my mind is, what do all these people have in common? Uh, they all knew Leo personally. Exactly. Sara and Mateo have motive. Look, Maggie... And frank, hold on, is our wild card, right, because everyone else has worked for Leo. Everyone else lives fairly close by except for frank, who last we heard was living in L.A... And dom, of course, who lives in Oakland. Maggie. What? I just want you to know... Oakland! - What? - The toll bridge. I have a contact at the bay area toll authority. They log every single license plate that crosses in and out of San Francisco. They should be able to tell us if dom actually went home that night. Oh, well, that's... That's brilliant. Thank you. Yeah, hi. Hi, dom. Can we come in and have a word with you, please? About what? We just have a few more questions, that's all. Yeah. Do you mind if I use your restroom, dom? No, it's just down the hallway. Thanks. Uh, we can... You know, I used to spend some time living in Oakland. Oh, yeah? I used to hate the hassle of commuting into the city every day. It can be rough. Yeah, but you've got to put up with those hassles when you're younger, right? I mean, who can afford a place in the city when you're starting out? But then, living out here, you have other expenses, you've got the car, you've got gas, and the tolls add up, every time you cross that bridge. Hey, did you know they record your license plate every time you cross? No. Yeah. They do. It's a security measure. That's how we know you weren't at home when Leo was murdered. What are you doing? You drove home across the toll bridge after the party at 10:00 P.M... But then you returned back to the city at 10:30. You never went back to Oakland until 1:45 the next day, an hour after Leo was killed. Okay, just wait a minute... Where'd you spend the night? Here. I swear, I spent it here. Somebody must have stolen my car, or borrowed it, 'cause I came home that night, and I went straight to bed, I swear. Leo couldn't remember much about the intruder who broke into his place, but he did remember one thing... The guy was wearing red sneakers. Now would be a really good time to start talking, dom. Okay, okay, but it's not what you think, I swear. I'm the one that broke into Leo's kitchen, but I didn't take anything! I was looking for something, that's all. You were the one outside the precinct last night, watching me. I can't sleep, you know. I can't stop worrying about what's going to happen. I've been feeling so guilty, I just needed to talk to you, and then I got scared and ran. What were you looking for? The diamonds. Diamonds? What diamonds? When Claudia and Leo got back from Italy, they told me what Vera had said to them, that carmella left Italy with a huge stash of family diamonds. They never resurfaced, so Vera said they must still be in the restaurant somewhere. Well, Leo must have known about them. He didn't believe it. Aunt Vera wasn't too with it at the end, but I thought, what if she's right? And Vera, she gave Claudia this letter, you know, said it contained a clue. Oh, really? A clue. Did Claudia believe it? She lost interest in the whole idea pretty quickly, but me, I couldn't let it go, you know? I kept going in after hours and looking around. I know how this sounds, me trying to steal from Leo after everything that he did for me, but you've got to understand, I grew up with nothing. Did Leo ever see you? Only that last time... And I knocked him down, which I still feel bad about, but I was scared, you know, and I ran... But you've got to believe me, I never shot Leo. He wasn't a blood relative, but he meant more to me than most of my own family. And your car that came back across the bridge and didn't return to Oakland until an hour after Leo was murdered? How do you explain that? 'Cause the guys at the taco stand, they can't confirm your alibi. I can't. All I can tell you is that I had nothing to do with this, I swear. Are you going to arrest me now? Why didn't you arrest him? Because all he's guilty of so far is letting himself into the restaurant after hours and not taking anything. But the car, the toll Bridges, the alibi! I know, but I can't hold him with any of that, you know? He's not a murderer. I don't think he's a flight risk... Although he does know more than he's telling us, which is why I'm trying to keep things friendly, in case he feels like talking. Okay. So what do we do now? You tell me. What do you mean? I mean... If you were taking the lead, where would we go? Well... I would go to the diamond district and see if anyone's tried to sell any diamonds in the last few days. Great idea. Really? Yeah. You're kind of getting the hang of this. Okay, ninth time's the charm. - Hello. - Hi. May I help you? I'm detective price, with the sfpd. We're looking for someone who may have come in here within the last week with some diamonds to sell. It may have been a fairly large stash. I don't recall anyone coming in to sell. Maybe it was just one diamond. Like I said... Maybe he just wanted to get it appraised. Look, I can't control who comes into my store and what they bring me. - Understood. - Of course. A guy came in with one diamond, just one, but it was big, more valuable than you usually see. He wanted it appraised, so I did it. It was worth over $30,000. What'd the guy look like? Kind of rough around the edges. I figured he'd stolen it. Since you're here, I'm assuming I was right. Was it him? No. No... He was a little older. Kind of big guy. How about him? Yeah. That's him. I want to talk to your father. Where is he? I don't know. I haven't spoken to him in over a year. You sure about that, dom? 'Cause we know he's in town. Maybe he borrowed your car? I, well, I don't know. It's all right, kid. Oh, whoa, whoa. Relax, detective, it's not loaded. Thanks for trying. I owe you one. You're coming with us. All right. Can I just finish what I'm making in there? What is it, by the way? It smells great. Oh, thanks. Stuffed cannelloni, my mom's recipe. Oh, yeah? Did you add lemon zest? I swear, I can smell lemons in here. I could tell you, but I'd have to kill you. It is a family recipe after all, you know. Right. I'm going to go with them. Here. Don't burn it, don't oversalt it, and save some for me. He's right. Don't oversalt that. I borrowed dom's car after he got home, and I took it back into the city. Why? I had a date. And how long did your date last? 'Til the morning. I got back to dom's around 2:00, but I'm guessing you guys already know that. Which puts you in the city at the time of Leo's death. Huh. Yeah, I guess it does. Where did the diamond come from? An acquaintance owed me some money. He gave me the diamond. I was having it authenticated. Or maybe Leo had a hidden stash of diamonds from his grandmother, and you killed him for it. Oh, you mean his crazy aunt Vera's story? So you've heard of them? Sure, yeah, Claudia told me. She also told me that the woman wasn't playing with a full deck. She thought she was Cleopatra in a past life. So you're saying there's no truth to the story? No, no, there is. It's why Leo and my sister worked 12-hour shifts at the restaurant, 'cause they're sitting on this massive fortune of diamonds. Cut the sarcasm, frank, or I'll be happy to keep you here all night. I'm sorry, detective. Am I under arrest? Not yet. Well, then, you can't keep me here all night, can you? "I keep our family legacy close to my heart." Maggie, can we take a break for a second? Can it wait? No. I need to talk to you now. Coffee would be great. Are you kidding me? What are you doing? I know where they're hidden. What? Your pendant, it's exactly like the pendant in the painting. When carmella said she's keeping her family legacy close to her heart, what if she meant it literally? You think the diamonds are hidden behind the painting? In her letter, she said that her marriage was unhappy. She would have hidden the diamonds because she didn't trust him. What I don't understand is why Leo didn't sell them. Because he never knew about them... But somebody did. Moment of truth. Here we go. Would you look at that? Looks like we found our hiding place. Now we just have to find our diamonds. So do we arrest frank? On what charges? So far, all we have is a ripped painting, a theory about long-lost diamonds, and a dead body. Believe it or not, I can't actually arrest anybody with that. Who would have known about the painting? It must be somebody in the family, or close to the family. Claudia wouldn't need to kill Leo. She could have just taken them. Unless he tried to stop her. Look, I've known Claudia forever. She's no killer. All right, so what about Sara? You said she was struggling financially. Claudia told us she used to flirt with Leo. Maybe they were in a relationship. Maybe Leo did know about the diamonds and just thought they were safe where they were. I mean, they've been hidden there for 70 years, right? He told Sara, and... And she killed him for the diamonds. Maybe you don't know her as well as you thought you did. Price. We've got something on frank. On the day of Leo's murder, he used a city bus pass at two locations. First on the corner of Melbourne and Hastings at 1:45 P.M. Melbourne and Hastings... That's near dom's house. What's the second location? He got on the second bus at westminster and colfax, three hours after he got on the first bus. A nearby bank surveillance camera picked up frank entering an electronics store at 2626 westminster. We're watching the surveillance footage right now. Why do I know that address? It fronted as a video store. We hit it during the investigation of the Coleman murder. That's right, with fake passports and social security numbers sold out the back door. That's the one. So frank was buying fake I.D.S the day Leo was murdered? That's what we've got to find out. Thanks, munro. Can I help you? I need a passport and maybe an out of state driver's license. Can you help me with that? Excuse me, you can't go back there! Sfpd, hands up! Detective price! It's been a while. Walter Isaacs. I should have known. Then again, I wasn't expecting you out for at least another five years. What can I say? I'm a model prisoner. Early release. Why don't you put the gun down, detective? There's no violent criminals here, just an artist at work. I can see that. I also see that prison hasn't dampened your skills. I'd be happy to show you more of my work, detective, if I could just see a warrant first. Oh, this isn't a bust. I was just looking for the bathroom. I guess I kicked down the wrong door. Everything okay in here? We're fine. I'll be right out. All right. New partner! Don't ask. So, how would you like to play this, detective? Shall we get lawyers? I'm going to make this real easy. You get a one-time pass if you help me with this person. Did you sell to this guy? He's been here, yes. Hmm. What did he want, and where was he going? Well, he wasn't going anywhere. He wanted a passport and social security number for a woman. A woman? Do you have a name or any photos? I don't exactly keep records, detective. Once the job is done, that's it. But you must have had a photo. What did she look like? Black hair, early 30s. Pretty. Is this her? Yeah, that's her. This was a one-time deal. Consider this place shut down. If I find you again, you're going back. Always a pleasure, Maggie. Captain, it's price. I just had a very interesting conversation in the back room of the electronics store. Yeah, frank wasn't there getting a new passport and social for himself. They were for Claudia. She wanted to disappear? Looks like it. If she found those diamonds, she'd be set for life. It'd be real easy for her to disappear and go someplace else. Huh. Maybe Leo tried to stop her, so she killed him. I'm not quite ready to arrest her just yet. We just showed up at her place. I'm going to go lean on her and see what she'll tell me. You need back up? Mm... not yet. All right. Be careful. You got it. She's not answering her phone or the door. Yeah, I didn't see her car out front. Why don't we just let ourselves in? Because I would need a warrant for that. Well, perks of being a civilian with a misspent youth. I can't let you do that. Look... Leo was my friend. I'm going to do whatever it takes to help solve his murder. If you don't want to be implicated with this, then I suggest you wait out here. Henry, I'm serious, do not go in there. Henry... You can be my lookout. You're on your own. Oh, come on! Really? Can't trust me to do this? Hi. Hi, Maggie. What are you doing here? I just wanted to drop by and check in on you, make sure you're doing okay. Oh... That's nice, thank you. Uh... I guess I'm exactly as you would think. In shock, mostly. Oh, can I help you with those? No. I'm fine, thank you. You sure? Yeah, um... If you'll excuse me, I just have to get these things into the freezer. Of course. You have a good night. You too. Come on... Maggie... What? Hello? Come on! Over here. Oh, that was close. Way too close. You know, uh... Back when you asked if I were to take the lead? Well, um... Hi. Hi. So... Well, uh... I found them. What? What? Oh my, these have to be worth a fortune. So what do we do now? Do we go in and arrest her? No, wait, I know. This is the part where you tell me why we don't go in there and arrest her. Well, for starters, now that you have removed the evidence from the crime scene, I don't even know if these are admissible. Bad move? Yeah, I'd say that's a bad move. Give me the diamonds. Claudia... Not a word. Inside. You know what a really bad move is, Claudia? Detaining an officer at gunpoint. So stop this now before you do something stupid. Too late. Come on, Claudia, drop the gun. Let's just talk. Why? No judge will ever believe that this was all an accident. Now give me your gun. Give me your gun right now, or I will shoot him. This has already gone too far. You don't think I would? Okay. Here. Inside. I know you won't believe me, but I never meant to hurt my husband. You don't think having an affair was hurting Leo? Hey, Maggie, what's up? Hello? I knew it would destroy him if he knew. That's why I broke things off. Our marriage wasn't a happy one, Henry. Bailey! Going to Italy was our chance to rekindle things. We just weren't in love with each other anymore. I don't even know how it happened, but things between us just died. I was ready to leave. And when you found the diamonds, you suddenly had your ticket out of here. I figured out the clue in the letter. They were in the painting, hidden in plain sight all this time. Let's go. I saw my chance to leave and start over with a fortune. You can hardly blame me for that. But you didn't have to kill Leo. He was supposed to be out for a walk, but he'd been watching me. He found my packed suitcase upstairs... And the diamonds. He confronted me before I could leave. You're back soon. I got as far as the coffee shop. I realized I didn't feel like taking a walk today. Are you feeling all right? I could make you some breakfast. And get these? Thank you. I wouldn't want to leave those behind. Where did you get that? And these diamonds... Claudia, what is going on? Leo, I'm leaving. Give me the bag. So it wasn't your fault. It was an accident. Yes, I swear to you... Then frank... Frank killed Leo at the hospital? Why? I promised him a share of the diamonds if he delivered me the new passport, and then after what happened with Leo... He knew that if Leo ever woke up, it was all over, and he would never get his share. I had no idea my brother could do something so terrible. After frank killed Leo, why didn't you come to us? Because I was terrified of what he might do to me, which is why I have to leave, and you have to let me. No one's going anywhere. I will take that. Thank you. Over there with them. Hello again! So... Where are the diamonds? I have them. Oh, that's inconvenient, but I guess that means that you're coming with me, then. Sorry, frank, I'm not going anywhere. You're going to have to shoot me. I'm not fooling around. Freeze! Lower your weapon! Drop your weapon, frank! Get off! Come on, let's get him out of here. So, you're a sharpshooter, too, huh? A flesh wound. He'll be all right. I'm starving. You literally can always eat. It's amazing. Are you in or not? I'm in, I'm in. You know, I've got this great place... Nope. No? I've been doing a little research, so follow me. So, I read this place has the best spicy noodles in the city. What? I am going to make a foodie out of you yet, aren't I? So... Are we going to talk about what happened? About the fact that you kissed me? I'd rather not right now. Okay... How about the fact that you kissed me back? I wouldn't say I kissed you back. Oh, really? What would you call it? You came at me out of the blue! That was hardly out of the blue! You were waiting for me to kiss you. What? I was on a case. The last thing I was thinking about was anybody kissing me. Ah, well, you could've fooled me. Wait. Did it actually just happen? What? Did I actually get the last word? No. I did. I just got the last word. No, you didn't get the last word. Yeah, I kind of did. I had you stumped. You were just walking there, not saying anything, and... You didn't have me stumped. Okay, you win that one. ♪ In that way
