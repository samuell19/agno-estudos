I have bogies approaching, 30 miles, 240 degrees. Come right 40. O.k., let's not get too anxious today. This is marines against Navy, 1-v-1. Try not to shoot down your wingman. Watch out. Watch out, squids. I'm hot today. Hey! O.k., meechum, close it up. I have Navy bearing 120, 20 miles. Come right 30, spreads a fighting wing. Navy 4, I have bogies closing. 18 miles, 240 degrees. Roger. I got 'em. They must be under this stuff. It's breaking up ahead. Bogies 8 miles. Come right 90. Leader has tally. One o'clock low. Preacher has tally. O.k. Fight's on. Go get them. Buenos dias, rustpickers. Come on. Make your move. Let's see what you got, buddy. Let's see it. Let's see it. Not bad. It's not bad. Not bad. You'd better kick it, Navy. Too late. Got you now, sucker. You watching US, leader? Affirmative. Yes. Hold still. Smile. O.k. I take a shot... Right there. Bang! Right up your six, rustpicker. That's a kill, meechum. O.k., o.X. I got this guy nailed. Press him. Stay with him. Coming up for the shot, and coming up, and right, right... Right there! Beautiful. That's a kill. Looked good, sweetheart. O.k., o.X., you clowns. Knock it off. The fight's over. Join on me. Outstanding, gentlemen! On your feet! To the greatest marine fighter pilot that ever crapped between two shoes. Some of you know him by his nom be guerre... The great santini. Some of you know him by names too foul to be repeated outside of this August company. Here's to our victory today over Navy. Here's to his new assignment as commander of the 312 squadron. I give you bull meechum! Senores, senores! Por favor! The noise is too much, you know? The other guests complain. Please? Oh, dearie. They don't like to hear US throw glasses? No, senor. Marines! Harooga! Harooga! Beat it! Maybe we should hold it down. I'd hate for you to get in trouble your last night in Spain. That would be just awful, wouldn't it? To the corps elite. To that special breed of sky devil known and feared throughout the world, the marine dogfighter. To the bravest men who ever lived. There's not a force who could defeat US, deny US victory, or interrupt our destiny. Marines! To victory! Who's in charge here? He is, sir. Right through there. What's wrong with this man? He's had the flu, sir. It's weakened him. Don't get smart with me, colonel. My wife and I and the other people out there would like a quiet, pleasant dinner, and we'd appreciate your clearing out and taking your ungentlemanly conduct with you. Sir, this is a going-away party for me. Drink up and move out. Yes, sir. Could we have one last drink at the bar if we promise to behave, captain? One. I don't want you anywhere near after that. Thank you, sir. O.k., you sweet, young things. I want you to go out to the bar and act like perfect gentlemen. You'll see a floor show that'll make marine corps history. Button up and go on out. Two of you take care of the skipper. That's good. All right, there. There you are. After you, colonel. To all squids and rustpickers... Harooga, harooga, harooga! Harooga! Care to dance with the great santini, ma'am? I don't... David. David! Get your hands off my wife! Colonel! Oh, my god! Chow down on me, hogs. Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, mother of god, pray for US sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Oh, if dad's plane crashed, we'd never forgive ourselves for not saying that extra hail Mary. Stand up straight, Ben. Come on. Don't slouch. That's it. I don't want to leave grandma's house. I want to stay here in Atlanta. We'll be back to visit. That's what you said about cherry point. We'll be back to cherry point as well. That's what you told Karen when we left camp lejeune. Don't spread dissension, Mary Anne. I want dad's homecoming perfect, do you hear? Want me to punch her, mom? They'll Bury you in a matchbox. Did you hear that? Mary Anne, stop it. I don't know why Matthew's so sensitive. He's practically a giant for a midget. Mamma! Mary Anne, let's take a walk. That's a splendid idea. You know, Benny boy, I've been thinking lately. Mind against mind, I maul you every time. Just remember I could knock every tooth out of your face, and there's very little you can do about it. Big, brave jock. So what? I'd get you back. I'd steal your clearasil. Within 48 hours, your pimples would multiply so fast, you'd be dead. There it is. There it is. Hey, mom! There it is! Oh, I see it, sugar, I see it. Get in line. He'll probably hold inspection. Ben, stand up straight. Girls, check your hair. All right, now, remember, when he gets off, we will walk... Walk, please... Walk to meet him, I'll go first, then the girls, then the boys. I'll give him a big juicy, and then the girls, and you boys shake hands firmly and say, "welcome home, colonel." Better get a chair for Matt to stand on. You're going to get it. Matthew! Oh, for heaven's sakes. Stand up here and let me get your hair combed. All right. Take it, now. Hurry up. Hurry up. Stand by for a fighter pilot! Ya-hoo! Hey, hey! I missed you, lil. I missed you. Oh, yeah? Me, too. Do you know when the worst times were? No. In the morning, just like now, before the kids got up. Oh, just lying here listening to that quiet, staring up at the ceiling... Aching for the feel of you. We got a lot of catching up to do, lady. Oh, my. Colonel, sir, I'm at your disposal. Oh, my... You've waited a long time for this command, haven't you? Too long. Too long. I'm so proud of you. Proud of you. Proud of you. You know I am. Colonel, sir... You think we'd try a little bit of that catching up now? Well, honey, sugar dumpling, bull meechum don't try nothin'. He just do. I know that. Oh! Oh, no! For heaven's sakes, bull, what time is it? Come on. Up and at 'em. I am not going anywhere at 3:00 in the morning. I want to be at the air station by 1600. Come back to bed. It doesn't make any sense. Moving day! Let's go, hogs! Everybody at the car in five minutes! Great to have you home, dad. Yay! All right! What's the next song, sports fans? Dixie. What a horseshit song. Watch your language. Yeah! Yeah! Dixie's a loser's song. Sing something else. Dixie! No! You sing Dixie, and I'll sing battle hymn of the republic. I'll sing a winner's song. You sing a loser's song. It's not a loser's song. Hey, Ben, wake up. Quit pretending you're asleep. Come on. I am asleep. Let's talk. What do you want to talk about? The white sox won yesterday. Oh. That's great, dad. Hey, dad, are you ever afraid when you fly? Hell, yes. That's what makes me so damn good. You'll know what I'm talking about when you're a marine pilot. What if I decide not to go into the corps? Well, you're going in. Four years, right after college. If you want out after that, well, that's your choice, but you're going in. Would you like to be killed in action, dad? It's better than dying of piles. Yeah. I hate this place. Now, sugar, you've got to open yourself to a town. You've been in the corps long enough to know that. I am not in the corps. Says you! Shut your yaps. This is it, sports fans... Beaufort, s.C. To think I mistook it for Paris, France. Look. Look at this guy. See if y'all can guess which house the great santini has rented for his family. Since the great santini has the worst taste in the free world, it should be easy. Has the great santini ever let his family down? Yes! Yes! Yes! You do not trust the great santini? No! No! No! Then have a look at this. What? There. Oh! Oh, bull! Oh, my god! Care to have a look, Scarlett? I'd be charmed, sir. Just like you always wanted. I got a cheap lease from a rich colonel nailed with a far east assignment looking for a classy tenant. I probably reminded him of Rhett Butler. I'm sure. What have you done? What have you done? What have you... Oh, my lord. They don't build them like this anymore. You can say that again. What did you do? What did you do? All for you, Petunia. Oh, my god. You have outdone yourself. Give US a big juicy. O.k., hogs, I've listened to you bellyache about moving to this new town. This said bellyaching will end as of 1530 hours, will not affect the morale of this squadron henceforth. Do I make myself clear? Yes, sir! I know it's rough to leave your friends and move every year, but you are marine kids and can chew nails while other kids are sucking cotton candy. And you're meechums. A meechum is a thoroughbred, a winner all the way, gets the best grades, wins the most awards, and excels in sports. A meechum never gives up. I want you hogs to let this burg know you're here. I want these crackers to wake up and wonder what the hell blew into town! O.k., hogs, by nightfall I want this camp in inspection order. Do you read me loud and clear? Yes, sir! I said, do you read me loud and clear? Yes, sir! Outstanding. Sergeant, dismiss the troops. Dismissed. He does remind me of someone from the movies, but it's not Rhett Butler. Who's that? Godzilla. Colonel hedgepath in, sergeant? No, sir. Where is he? He's indisposed at the moment, sir. I asked where he was, not for your mastery of the English language. In the head down the hall, sir. Hey! Hey! Goddamn it! Gotcha! What the hell? Goddamn it! You're probably wondering why I attacked you, right? Yes, sir. What's your name, corporal? Atchley, sir. Atchley, do you realize several marines were killed by the Japanese at Pearl harbor while taking craps? No, sir. A fighting man must be vigilant to surprise attack no matter where he is. The survival of our nation depends on the readiness of marines all over the world. Also, and more important, you only wiped yourself twice. Grossly insufficient. Right now, germs with names you can't even pronounce are preparing to launch a devastating attack that will render you helpless in defending your country. Do you read me? Yes, sir. Good. I'm colonel John j. Jones. I'm only here for the day. I fly around the country testing the readiness of troops. This is a strictly confidential test, classified top secret. Tell no one, atchley, and if you ever attack a senior officer again, I'll have you court-martialed. But you attacked me, sir. Dismissed! Good luck in your career. Be proud, atchley... Proud of yourself and proud of the corps. Now get out. Yes, sir. You silver-tongued bastard. Shame on you. Is he back yet, cop? Yes, sir. He's expecting you. Banzai! Close that door, sergeant! I don't want to humiliate this man any more than I have to. Now, colonel, repeat after me... Bull meechum has menstrual cramps. Kiss me where the skin turns pink, you worthless scum! What kind of man assaults corporals with their pants down? I want to know about that one. How are you, virg? I'm good. Good to see you, buddy. Welcome aboard, bull. Tell me who put me in varney's group. He hates my guts. I know. I know. The squadron's in trouble. Used to be one of the best, but the last two c.O.S really let it slip. Varney's in line for a star, you know. He knows if he's going to make general, he'll have to shape up the 312th. It's that simple. You heard I got passed over? Passed over? You're lucky you didn't get busted. I heard about that mushroom soup stunt. Yeah? Yeah. Go ahead and grin, dummy. I'm telling you, bull, you better watch your six from now on. You've got your squadron, right? Just keep your nose clean for a change. Yes, sir. And don't go raping any more corporals in the latrine, colonel Jones. Yes, yes. My god, you never change. What are you thinking, colonel? Nothing, sir. Yes, you are, wilbur. You're thinking, "why doesn't that son of a bitch" "quit reading those damn papers and welcome me aboard this station?" Isn't that what you were thinking? Yes, sir. That's exactly what I was thinking, sir. Sit down. O.k., now understand this, wilbur. The only reason I picked you for this job... Despite the fact that you're a disgrace to the corps and on your way to being an alcoholic... Is that you're a fair leader and a crackerjack pilot. Thank you, sir. Just sit there and shut up. Cuba is hot. Very hot. If it pops, we'll be right in the middle of it. Now, I want you to start getting these pilots into shape. As much as I need this job done, it won't break my heart if you fall on your butt again. That way I can end your career with a poor fitness report. Do you read me? Yes, sir. That's all. Dismissed. Get your trousers pressed, colonel. Yes, sir. Rise and shine, split tails! Inspection at 0900 by commanding officer. 0900! Lillian! I'm hungry! Rise and shine! Dad! Jesus! Hey, Lillian, the little homo's sleeping naked! Let's go! Up and out! Let's shake it out, hog. Inspection at 0900. Let's go! Stand by for a fighter pilot. What you say, captain? I am the great santini! I's arrabelle smalls, your new maid. Never worked for no Italian before. Pure Irish. Madam, you're a solid-looking woman. I can punch hard as a man. You want to hit my shoulder? This is a marine you're talking to. I might cause internal bleeding. Shoot, man. You go on and hit arrabelle's shoulder. Come on down here. O.k., lady, watch out. You are solid as a rock. Now it's my turn. Right here. Go on. God! Wait! You call that punching? You want me to do it again? Hell, no. If you hurt your hand, I'll have to pay the doctor bills. What is going on out here? Oh! Why, you must be Mrs. Smalls. I is. I'm Lillian meechum, and this is my husband lieutenant colonel bull meechum. My kind of woman. Oh, yeah? That says a lot. Erline grantham spoke very highly of you. She said you spent a lot of time in jail for stealing silver out of nice houses. Miss erline don't put no trash mouth on me, captain. You'll get used to his teasing or you won't. It'll be there one way or the other. Lillian, I want chow. It is I, santini! Beast of beaufort wants his breakfast! Eat! Eat! Well, I hope you like children. We have four. Children is the only perfect people there is. I got me a fine boy. He sells honey and flowers hereabouts. Is he the one that drives a wagon and mule? That's him. That's my boy toomer. Castro, you bearded fag! I'd like to chase you down the main street of Havana in my f-4! And be gaulle! God, why do you put so many jerks in the world at the same time? Kind of peculiar, ain't he? He's just reading his paper. Come on in. Attention on deck. Seats, gentlemen. Morning. You men have the privilege of serving under the meanest, toughest, screamingest squadron commander in the marine corps... me. Now, I don't want you to consider me as just your commanding officer. I want you to look on me like I was... Well... God. If I say something, you pretend it's coming from the burning bush. Now, we're members of the proudest, most elite group of fighting men in the world. We are marine corps fighter pilots. We have no other function. That is our mission, and you're either going to hack it... Or pack it. Do you read me? Within 30 days, I'm going to lead the toughest, flyingest sons of bitches in the world. The 312 werewolf squadron will make history, or it will die trying. Now, you're flying with bull meechum now, and I kid you not... This is the eye of the storm. Welcome aboard. Carry on. Come on! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! O.k., Benny boy! Come on, now. Dad, dad, dad! Dad, dad, dad! Come on, now. The reason I'm going to beat you, dad, is because you're getting a little fat. Yeah? Yeah? One. That's one. How about that, sports fans? We know you can do that. Go, Benny boy! Hey, hey, foul! Foul. He's starting to cheat. 2-1. No foul. Did you see that? 2-1.2-1.2-1. No foul. No foul. 2-1. Who's for me? Who's for me? Let's hear it! Stay in there. That's dirty play. 8-6, hog. You're finished. Says you. How do you feel, dad? You look a little tired. Look a little ragged. Gee! Hey! 9-9. Don't worry, colonel, you can always get a disability pension. Don't goad him, Ben. Come on, just play. Last shot, jocko. Give up? Stay close, Ben. Now, watch him. Whip his Fanny, Ben! It is I, the great bentini! Do you know, dad, not one of US has ever beaten you at a single game? Not checkers, not dominoes, not softball. Watch it, Ben. He's getting that look. Come over here. Come over here to daddy bull. It's all over, colonel. You played a great game, dad. Get out of here before I knock every freckle off your face. That's mean. Wasn't that great? Come on, jocko. You got to win by two baskets. You said one. I changed my mind. Let's go. Don't cheat the boy out of his victory. Who the hell asked you anything? Don't you talk to me like that! I'll play him, mom. No. He beat you, and it was beautiful. You better get in the house before I kick your butt. Now, I mean it. Come on. Let's go. Hurry. Come on. You better move, woman. All right! Come on. Let's go. He beat you. Get out of here! Kind of like winning, dad? Get smart with me, I'll kick your butt. Guard me. You got to win by two. I'm not going to. I won. Mamma's boy, I bet you're going to cry. Come on, mamma's boy. Let's see you cry. Squirt a few. Come on, cry. Come on, cry. Come on! Just a few. Come on. Squirt a few. Come on. Come on, cry. 1, 2, 3, cry. 1, 2, 3, cry. Come on! Cry. Come on, baby. Come on, little girl, cry. Cry. You're my favorite daughter, Ben. I swear to god you're my sweetest little girl. This little girl just whipped your ass good, colonel! How are you feeling, sugar? I'm o.X., mamma. How are you? Oh, I'll live through the night. You know what I was thinking? What? I was praying we'd all go to war again so king Kong out there could fight somebody besides me. Shame on you. That's a terrible thing to say. Your father loves you very much. He's got a fabulous way of showing it, ma. You're going to cut off all your circulation doing that. Do you love him? Of course. Of course I do. I think he treats you crappy. Oh, harsh words were never fatal to anybody. Well, what about harsh kicks, mamma? He was getting ready... Well, he didn't. Ben, your father has never hit me once during our entire married life. Oh, honey. What happened today won't make any difference in five years. He does what he does because he loves you, and he wants you to be the best. Oh, sure. "I love you, Ben." Punch. "I want you to be the best, Ben." Kick. "And, Ben, I think you're great, Ben." Bounce the basketball off of my head. Oh, stop it. Hasn't there been enough? Come over here. You know why he's down there? No, ma'am. Well, I'll tell you. He is admitting to you that the gap is closing, that he's going to have to practice if he beats you from now on. He's admitting to you that he's getting older, and that is the hardest thing in the world for a man like bull. Well, mamma, that doesn't change anything. Well, it should. Don't you think he knows that you're up here watching him? You've got a strange father, Ben. Well, that's the only way he knows how to say, "I'm sorry, son." And let me tell you, there isn't another person in god's good world that he would do that for. You try to think of that when you feel he doesn't love you. Get out of those clothes? Take a shower. Do you want anything to eat? Sure? I love you. O.k, close it up. I want you right up his six. Stay on him. Stay on him, wizard. Close! Close! Left, milkman, left. Now turn. Turn! No, no. Anticipate. See that bogy, wizard. Bleed him, bleed him. O.k., you're lined up. He's on you, milkman. Do something. Come left. Tighter. Tighter, wizard. Press him. Push him! There's a shot. There it is. It's all over, milkman. Bang. That's a kill. Go lay down and die, milkman. You're finished. That's a kill. What are you boys doing down there? Take him into the sun, barstool. Up, up. That's it. Watch your six. Watch your six! What the hell? Watch... Watch... What's the matter with you guys? Kill the bogy, not your leader. You fly like a bunch of pussies! Jesus Christ! Hush. Hush up. That's about the ugliest cat I ever did see. That's the ugliest looking cow pulling that wagon I ever did see. A cow! Why, this here is man o' war, winner of the Kentucky derby. That there is rin tin tin, star of stage, screen, and TV. Hey, toomer. Hi, mamma. Mrs. Meechum, this here's my son toomer. Why, toomer, it is a pleasure. How are you, ma'am? Fine. These here are for you. Why, how lovely. Bless your heart. Well, where you heading, son? I thought I'd do me some f-f-fishing. You bring me back some nice flounder so I can fix for this family. You done much fishing, Ben? Not in salt water. Well, why don't you go? You want to come along, dribbling man? We be out all night. Could I, mom? Well, sure. Get your jacket and some blankets. Right with you. That poor boy has lived in cities and on bases so long, he's never really tasted the south. Oh, thank you, toomer. I'm going to fix you some sweet potato pie this weekend. Thank you. Thank you for these. Bye. See you, mamma. Bye. Look coming here. Hey, t-t-toomer. How you d-d-doing, b-b-boss? Who was that? He ain't nobody. Name's red pettus. Him and his family h-h-hate a black man j-j-just for being black. They's shrimp folk. Old red... can't even talk to him. How many dogs you got here? Don't rightly know. 12, 14. Maybe more. Some comes and goes. Is that where you live? Home sweet home. You got to make friends with the gray. Who's the gray? See him? What's he mad about? He don't like white folks much. Come on, boy. Come on. Come on. Here. Feed him this. Boy, you act like you're feeding an alligator. He looks kind of mean. What you talking about, mean? He... he... he just prejudiced. Good boy. You know what, toomer? This is terrific. There's a shooting star. That ain't no star, boy. That's the tear of infant Jesus falling, on account of it's such a sinful and hateful world. This sure is one fine night, ain't it, white boy? Yeah. This is one fine night. God, they're all staring at US like we're freaks or something. No, they're not. Look. Just pick someone out, go on up to them and say, "hi. My name's Mary Anne meechum. I'm new in town. I'd like you for a friend." Why don't you? Look at this. Look at this. My, my, my, my, my, my. It's Ansley Matthews and Jim Don Cooper, the varsity fullback. So what? Jesus, I'm in love. Have you told him yet? That's funny. Very funny. Mr. and Mrs. Neanderthal. Cute. Hey, shake it out, hog. Let's go. What's the matter? God, dad, it's 4:00. Happy birthday, boy. You woke me up at 4 A.M. To give me my birthday present. That's great. What is it? It's a training bra. Open it. I've been saving it for you for 18 years. Looks good. That was my first. I wore it in wwii when I flew with the cobras. It's great, dad. Thanks. They don't make them like that anymore. It's part of the old corps. Christ, you're 18, Ben. I woke up thinking about the day you were born. I was on a hop, and all I heard when I landed was that your mother was in a hospital. So I went crazy. I hit 100 miles an hour getting there, knocking nurses out of the way, running over the small children, crashing into patients on the way to the operating room. And you're screaming your head off. I'm banging on the window trying to get your attention, bragging to everybody who'd listen that the toughest little fighter pilot in the world had been born. Then I ran down to see how your mother was, expecting her to look like... Horseshit from hell after punching you out of her system. Hell, she was sitting up, looking prettier than I'd ever seen her. That was 18 years ago. 18 years ago today. I was 23. That was some day. I got to register for the draft within 10 days. I'll take you down. I want you to meet me at the club at 1700 for a little celebration, o.X.? O.k. Tell mamma we'll be home for supper and the cake cutting at 1830. Wear a coat and tie. Yes, sir. Go back to sleep. My dear son, my dear Ben, my dear friend who becomes a man today. I wanted to write you a letter about being a man and what that means in a Fuller sense. I wanted to tell you that gentleness is the quality I most admired in men, and then I remembered how gentle you were, so I decided to write something else. It's just this... I want you to know that whatever you do or wherever you go, you walk with my blessing and love. I've had my regrets and many sadnesses, but I will never regret the night you were born. I thought I knew about love and the boundaries of love until I raised you for these past 18 years. I knew nothing about love. This has been your gift to me. Happy birthday. Mamma. Hey, sports fan, over here. What the hell you grinning about? This is really my day. I made the varsity team. Of course you did. You only had the greatest coach in the world. Congratulations on your 18th. Thanks, colonel. What will you have? Dr. Pepper. I didn't bring you down here to drink soda pop. You're old enough to drink now. Mom will get mad, dad. Besides, I'm in training now. If he doesn't want to drink... There's those that got them, and those that don't. What? Gonads, son. Big brass ones. Bartender, I'll have a double Martini up with a twist. Do you know what a double Martini is? Sure. Will you leave him alone? It's made out of liquor. You bet. Happy birthday, kid. Just a minute, Ben. Gentlemen! Gentlemen... I would like you to join me in a toast to my oldest son, who's 18 today. He just ordered his first drink. Before he begins drinking it, I would like to wish him a long life, a wife as fine as his mother, and a son as fine as he's been. To my son. Happy birthday! Hear! Hear! Congratulations. Congratulations, kid. How is it, big man? It's fit to drink, but I've tasted better. Bartender, let's have another here. Slow down, Ben. That's an alligator of a drink. That's why I ordered it, Virgil. It's colonel hedgepath to you, mister. Sir. Sir, my apologies. Hey. This is great, really great. Hey, waiter, another drink for my son. Lillian's going to scalp you, bull. Heck, virg, come on. I don't even have a buzz on yet. God. Hey! Hey! This is really great, dad. You like it? Really great, really great. Sober up, dad. Drink up, son. Drink up? You know what I was thinking? What? I think it's really great. I think it's great. Virg, virg, I think this is great. Dad? Great! God! What about it? Dad. Hey, dad. O.k. Almost. Here they come! Oh, my gosh. Turn out the light, quick! When I say "now," turn on the lights, and then we start singing. Come on, now. Oh, for h
