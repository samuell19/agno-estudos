Once there was a girl who was invisible. No one could see her. And no one could hear her. She wasn't a ghost. Her invisibility was simply a fact she had to live with. That girl is me. - This looks amazing honey! - Good! My older sister was the pretty one. Melody is such a cow. How come she can eat whatever she wants? Cows only eat grass, stupid. And they have a four-part stomach. My little brother was the smart one. Wanna bet? The rumen, the reticulum, the omasum and the abomasum. - Quit showing off. - Quit tossing your hair. Dad was generally clueless. How about we enjoy this amazing dinner your mother made? Mmm. - Troy... - And I was the middle child. Those green beans are to die for. Troy, sweetie. Holly hasn't had any. Luckily there was Mom. Thank you. Hmm. Mom was interested in everything. To her the world was full of wonder and mystery. A puzzle to be solved. See how much it changes when you rotate it even slightly? Yeah. It's a kaleidoscope. See, I'm fascinated by the fact that you can rearrange the same shapes and colors and get a whole new pattern. That is the look that means I don't want to hurt her feelings but I'd rather be doing my algebra homework. - Pre-Algebra. - Mm-hm. Alright, get out. When she got sick, I wasn't worried because they said the treatments were working. - What's a simile? - It's an analogy. Like um... If I say to you, I love you like bread loves butter. Oh. So like... I love you like laundry loves laundry detergent? Exactly. Or I love you like... A foot loves a sock. Ow, it hurts! Oh no... should we call you a doctor? - No, no, no, no! - Tender knees... Then mom died, and everything changed. Without her, I began to fade. It started at home. Vanessa, are you feeling okay? You haven't eaten anything. I just can't have carbs. I'll puff up like a blowfish. Troy? How's school going? Fine. That's great. You didn't ask me anything. What's that? Forget it. Okay. And then it spread to other areas of my life. Just to review, everyone is reading chapters two and three. And doing the study questions in the back of the book. Does anybody have any questions? - Nobody? - I have a question. Okay then, have a good weekend. What? And by the end of the summer, I was gone. How come nobody woke me up? Vanessa, would you stop for a second and look at me? Ugh! Troy, I specifically told you... hey! What I wouldn't give for a good night's sleep. Dad, Troy and Vanessa are ignoring me again. Where did your mom keep the camera? Here we go. Does nobody care that I'm going to be late for the first day of school? - Dad! - Aahh! What the hell was that? Uh, gotta capture the first day of school. Get over by the window. Ugh... It's gonna be backlit. It'll be perfect. I want to be in it too. Thanks for asking. Perfect. That's a keeper. God, I have a double chin. The lighting is horrible. I'm not there. I think it's great. What's happening? Why are you all pretending I'm not here? But they weren't pretending. I didn't want to accept it, but I had disappeared from sight and from memory. It was like I never existed. I guess it's like anything. Eventually you adapt. Hello. Delivery. Does it say to ring twice? All things considered, I live a pretty normal life. I have my own place in a building that does corporate rentals. Nobody knows anybody, so I fit right in. And I have a job. Mostly, I work nights. I'll be right back. Gotta take care of something, alright? We ain't got a lot of time. You suck, Bobby. Besides, you're a married man now. Come on, you know me and her are just for show. Come here. If you think I feel bad about what I do, you'd be wrong. I show people as they really are. Pretty terrific, huh? I'm telling you, this girl is good. Thank you. And she delivers. Always delivers. No muss, no fuss. And she's cheap! - Not anymore, I'm not. - Yeah. Couldn't be happier. Yeah. It's great. Hang on for a minute. Who the hell is this? Who is this? Oh for heaven's sake. I just sent you the cover photo. That's it. This girl has a sixth sense. I don't know how she does it. What the hell is this? As for my family, Troy still lives at home. He moved to the basement as a teenager, for the view. It's what supposedly inspired his career as a visual artist. Troy has been working on an experimental film called Top Ten Legs of the Last Decade for... well, the last decade. And using our mother's legs as a benchmark. Vanessa had remained her own number one fan until she married Marjus, a Lithuanian elevator inspector. Come on baby. We're gonna be late. - How do I look? - Perfect. Come, come, come. And with that, she doubled her fan club. And Dad had found a new love in commercial real-estate. You guys go ahead. I might have found a buyer for this incredible granary. Friday night dinner is still a tradition although Marjus is usually held up at work. Hey. Yeah. Yeah, I figured. What floor are you on? Vanessa, you haven't eaten anything. Um, meat makes me nauseous. Troy, how's the job search coming? That depends on how you define job. Why do you have to be so obnoxious? - Well why do you have to be so obtuse? - Enough! No, not you. No, I love you. Not much has changed. My favorite things about being invisible... Going anywhere, seeing everything, not having to worry about rules or good manners, or even caring what I look like. Never feeling ashamed or embarrassed. The worst thing is not being a part of anything. Let's all have another round! I think I need to lie down. Hey! Hey, you! Hey! Why are you following those people? Alright. You can see me? Ever heard of respecting people's privacy? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? - This conversation is over. - Blackwell! Wait! - I'm not letting you back in. - Wait! Blackwell, we need you in there. Wait, don't go, I was just... Can you see me? Hello? Mom, you'll never believe what happened. I met someone who can see me. He could hear me too. Just some random bouncer. But the bad news is that I'm still invisible to everyone else. So I... I don't know what that means. I really... I don't know how to put the pieces together. What's wrong, little bird? What's going to happen when you die? I'll be with you in spirit. Do you know what that means? It means that the wind will carry me to you, whenever you need me. - Yeah, right. - It will. You'll see. How come you'll be in the wind? Because the wind is the soul's messenger. But if I can't see you, how will I know you're there? Because you'll feel loved. That's when it dawned on me. What if he wasn't some random bouncer? What if we were connected? Shayne Blackwell, former world champion and one of the most sought-after fighters in MMA is now all but forgotten. What happened? Shayne Blackwell first on to the scene with a series of unexpected wins against veteran fighters. From there, his career took off. Fans latched onto his rags to riches story and he caught the eye of actress and supermodel, Julianna King. Shayne and Julianna became the "it" couple of the moment. Until this. These photos of Blackwell caught cheating on Julianna quickly went viral. The breakup was immediate. Shayne's fans turned against him. And his life spiraled out of control. It all came to a hit at the championship fight against Attila Matae. Blackwell had been an early favorite to win. Instead, he suffered a crushing defeat by Matae. Maybe it's karma. Cheaters never win. Thanks for watching. Tune in next week. Shayne Blackwell? Do you remember me? Vaguely. What do you want? You think I haven't seen this picture a hundred times? I took it. I took that picture. - Why are you telling me this? - I... I want... - I... - That picture destroyed my life. - I know. - No, you don't know. But you don't care. Makes you feel better about your own sorry life. You're probably right. Stay away from me. I can't. You can't? You're the only person who can... Who can what? I want to make it up to you. You want to make it up to me? You want to make it up to me? Alright yeah, uh, so yeah, you just gotta fix my reputation. You gotta... you gotta restart my fighting career. And then you gotta get me back with Julianna. That's it. If you do all that, you'll have made it up to me. I can fix your image. I can. And I could help with your career. I don't know about your girlfriend but I can try. You're crazy. What...? I'm trying to help. - Do you mind? I got somewhere to be. - I don't mind at all, no. I mean, get lost. We're done. But that's not what you said. Look, I'm gonna meet my manager over there. I got some business to take care of. Give me five minutes in there with you. If you don't think after five minutes that I can help you, then I'll leave you alone. And you have to promise to ignore me. Done. Yay! Hey! There he is. The champ! - What's up, brother? - Not much, same old. - How about you? - Ah, you know, maintaining. Trying to make this million. Trying to make you rich. Basically no information has been exchanged so far. - What are you doing? - G&T. You? Don't talk to me. That's the deal. - Pops! - And right about now you're gonna start to wonder why it is that he doesn't seem to notice me. Double Scotch. G&T, Double Scotch. So beat this, huh? I got an offer for you to book you on a live show. What kind of show? Celebrity Poker Rodeo. - Never heard of it. - Are you serious? It's where a bunch of has-beens play poker in front of an audience. Dude, you shoot the breeze with a couple of celebrities. And that's it. - Simple. - Has-beens. - Are you hearing this? - What? Hold on. Oohoo! Oooohh. It's the wife. Definitely not his wife. So what's up? You gonna do this or what? Is that all you got? When's it start? Let's see. It's next Tuesday, as long as you stay in the game once a week. How much does it pay? Eight hundred dollars a pop. It says fifteen hundred here. Just so you know. I thought it was fifteen hundred. Who told you that? Just something I thought you said last time. Oh yeah? Let me check. Mm, I see it. It's right there. Fifteen hundred. Even sweeter. Talk to me. I'll be outside when you want to talk. Champ, this is what you've been waiting for. Exposure. Play some poker. They're gonna be like, "Who is this guy? Look how brolic he looks. I want to fight him." So sup, you in or what? What was that in there? It's uh, it's complicated. Okay. It sounds really crazy to um... to say it. - Say what? - That I'm a... I'm invisible. What does that mean you're invisible? Well... Not to you, obviously. But to everyone else. Right. - You don't believe me? - No, I don't. Well didn't you see what just... just happened in there? How do you think that I take my pictures? I don't use a fancy lens. I don't have to. I'm-I'm right there. Okay, you know what? I don't need to know what your trick is. You want me to prove it to you? Fine. I'll-I'll prove it to you. What are you doing? Get out of the street. If he sees me, he's gonna stop, right? And not if he's drunk. Get out of the street. I need you to believe me. Could have gotten yourself killed. Tell her that. - Who? - Her. Psycho. I would have moved, I just... I was proving a point. He couldn't see you. No. And Brandon, my manager, he couldn't see you. So I'm the only guy in this whole city who can see you? My family lives right over the bridge and they can't see me either. Unless... Let's assume for a second it's true... and I'm not saying I buy it... but let's just assume I'm the only guy in the whole world who can see you. What am I supposed to do with that? I think we're supposed to help each other. I'm Holly, by the way. Okay, how about this? That building on the corner over there, apartment 510, that's me. If you're still invisible in the morning, come by and we'll talk. - What time is it? - Six. You said come by in the morning. What's up with you? She's usually more of a guard dog. She can't see me, remember? Look... What do you want from me? I wasn't always like this. And you weren't always like... this. My point is maybe if I can fix what I broke... then things will go back to normal for both of us. How do you plan to do that? I'm sorry, this is just so strange. Tell me about it. No, I-I mean the way that... You look at me and not through me. I'm just not used to it. I gotta take her out. Maude, let's go. How'd she lose her leg? That's how I found her. Tied to a post. Someone gave up on her same as me. Who gave up on you? What's that guy's problem? Oh he, uh, thinks you're talking to yourself. Everybody in this city talks to themselves. - So who gave up on you? - What? - You said... - Oh. Yeah. My mom's boyfriend kicked me out when I was thirteen. Decided I was old enough to fend for myself. Where did you go? Wherever. Around. - You slept on the street? - In cars, mostly. I've done that. There was this junkyard nearby, no place to shower though. Kids at school would make fun of me so I started getting into fights. Eventually I dropped out. You kept fighting though. One day, I take on this guy. Disrespected some girl at a bar. These kids at my old school gather round. Me and him were going at it. He was a big dude too. All of a sudden they start calling my name. Like cheering me on like I'm all of a sudden important or whatever. That's when I'm like, if this is what it means to be a fighter, I think I just found my calling. We gotta get you back out there. I still fight. Wait. You still fight? - Why didn't you say something? - 'Cause you didn't ask. Well that makes things a lot easier. I got a fight on Friday if you want me to put you on the list. Oh that-no I-I can't go into crowds. I wouldn't worry. - Hey! - Whoo! Look at that, huh? Good as new. Hardly. Nice going, champ. Should I tell them same time next month? I'll be there. My man. It's for you. You earned it. Is that three hundred dollars? You don't do it for the money, you do it 'cause you love the sport. You call this a sport? It may not look like it to you but there's a lot of strategy in MMA. It's a lot more than throwing punches. It seems like people throwing punches. Oh... Okay look, say you got... Say you got a... a... a wrestler over here and then a... a kick boxer over here. Okay? And... and... and they're both very good at what they do. But they're different you know? Like one's a hurricane and one's a tornado and... and so you get these two crazy opposing forces of nature in the ring and... and... and... and it takes everything they've got to beat the other one, you know? Physical, mental... It's like a game of chess. It's like chess. Still, I mean three hundred dollars is just wrong. The other guy gets half, so... go talk to him. We need to get you better venues. And bigger fights. - You think so? - Yes. How you gonna match me up with better fighters? 'Cause let's be real, nobody who's anybody is gonna fight me. Why not? 'Cause I don't sell tickets anymore. Just get me a list. Yeah, right. So what a super moon is, is it's the closest a full moon gets to the earth. You know the orbit of the moon is not a perfect circle, it gets closer and farther away. So from Sunday night going to Monday night we'll have the closest full moon of the year. Now this one is a... The moon hasn't been this close to the earth since January 1948. So it's been a long time since it was this close. Can you give us the details of how much larger and how much brighter it might get? Someone who wants to make a deal. It's open. So, I have some news. Oh wait, wait, two seconds. Finish line's right here. Which one of these guys is gonna win? Oh. The... the top one. - You sure about that? - Definitely. Look there they go. - Okay. - Come on. - Go! Go! - Come on. - Yes! - Aw. How did that happen? Let me tell you, this is not my first rodeo. I mean... I just mean, um I've spent a lot of time staring out of windows. When you said it wasn't always like this for you what did you mean? It started when my mom died. She was kind of the only one who got me. So when she was gone, I just kind of... I was twelve. I'm sorry. Oh you should... you should probably take that. - Hey champ! - Hey Brandon, what's up? Get ready for this. Pulled some strings. You're gonna be fighting The Clever Suarez in six weeks. - You're kidding. - He's not. Yeah what - uh... I will. Okay. Alright. Bye. Let me guess. You're fighting Carlos The Cleaver Suarez. - How did you pull that off? - You let me worry about setting up the fights. You worry about the training. You're awesome. You better get to work. Alright, yeah. Drop and give me twenty! I'm kidding. Shayne Blackwell. Now there's a name we haven't heard in a while. This match up with Carlos Suarez came out of nowhere. I give the guy credit for giving it a shot but we're talking about a five year lay-off here. Suarez is a great competitor. He's the real deal. He has a great ground game. What I want to know is, how do you make up for all this lost time in just six weeks? Hey look, Shayne Blackwell was a good fighter. Maybe a great fighter back in his day. Blackwell is way out of his league if you ask me. Suarez is gonna put him away in the first round. Call in guys, let me know what you think. My prediction? He's gonna get killed out there. What's with the pictures? For publicity. I'm fixing your image. Who's Troy? My brother. I didn't know you had a brother. I have an older sister too. What's your family like? Well let's see. My uh, my brother is a pervert who spends his days ogling women's legs. Seriously. And my sister's interest in the world consists of what's on her plate. Her latest diet is sesame crackers and water. She says everything else makes her nauseous. Maybe she's pregnant. Yeah right, she could never stand to gain the weight. Wait, so your family never talks about you? No. It's like I never existed. That's insane. I wish I could be at the fight. You're not coming? I don't do crowds that size. - Why? - The last time I did I got this. Oh my God. I had to give myself stitches. So I will be watching you but from home. Why don't you come watch the fight at my place? Okay. Alright. Come on, baby! We gonna be late. Hi Marjus. Hey Ness... Mind if I borrow some clothes? Does this look too tight on me? It feels too tight. - You look perfect. - Perfect. I promise I'll bring them back. Well Blackwell came into tonight's match as the underdog. You can see him trying to find his rhythm against an opponent in his prime like Suarez. But we have seen him win a lot of belts in the past. Keep doing what you're doing, champ! You got him! Blackwell tries to gain some distance from Suarez. Yeah! Blackwell looks a bit stunned but he shakes it off. Suarez now looking for a takedown. You got him, you got him! He's in a tight bout! Yeah! - And it's all over! - Yes! Blackwell wins by submission in the third round! - Unbelievable. - Yes! What an upset! Yeah! He tapped out! Whoo! And the winner is Shayne Blackwell! You're the champ. Number one! What'd I tell you, huh? Stick with me, kid. You the man! By the way, that purse is not quite what they said. Something about taxes what have you. But for the next fight, you're gonna be making triple what you made now. Yeah! Champ right here! Champ right here! Thanks, bud. Shayne? Dan Wolfe, Gotham News. Congratulations on your big win tonight! Thanks, man. You went in as the underdog in a lot of people's minds. What happened? I mean, Suarez is a great fighter. He made a mistake and I capitalized on it. Yeah. Rumor has it you're gonna be fighting Tommy Bones next. Yep. Uh, any reason you're not out tonight celebrating? Did you get injured? I feel great. And I do plan to celebrate. - Hey Maude. - You did it. Felt pretty good. - Oh my God, your eye! - Looks worse than it is. You take that. Come on. I want to show you ladies something. There you go. Hey, stick that thing in the door, will you? There you go. - Not bad, huh? - Wow. Here you go, I got this for you. And this is for me. - What kind is it? - Peanut butter ice cream. The best thing ever after a fight. I couldn't have done it without you. You looked great out there. You really did. Thanks. You look good, by the way. Thank you. Can I ask you something? Yeah. Are you sure you're real? What is that supposed to mean? You know. Maybe I took a few too many hits to the head over the years. You know just because people can't see me doesn't mean I don't exist. Alright, see? I knew you were gonna get mad. - You're writing me off. - I'm not writing you off. I'm just... trying to understand. Hey. I want you to be real. Prove it. Hey! Come back with that camera. No, no, no! Well hey, jokes on him. It's gonna look like you're alone in that picture. Hope you like sleeping under the stars. Come here. Your heart is beating really fast. Okay, whoa! Is this okay? No, it's... it's good... it's... It's really good. It's just new. We can take our time. Okay. What? I don't know what to do next. I got some ideas. I'm in the photo. I'm in the photo! Yes! Thank you! Tommy, as a two-time platinum belt winner, what's your prediction going into the fight? - How many times did I win that belt? - Two times. Man, this joker been out of the game for five years. I bet you right here, I get that submission in the first round. Shayne, what do you say to that? I've been working hard and I know what I'm capable of. All that matters is what happens in the cage. Only thing that'll happen in that cage is I'm gonna beat your ass like a drum. Shayne, is it true you fired your manager? Yeah, we parted ways. You sure it wasn't the other way around? I'm gonna give you a little preview of what it's like when I mop the floor with his face. I'm gonna make it look like Matae took it easy on you, baby. Why don't you walk over here, I'll knock you out right now. Gentlemen, gentlemen, please. The fear in his eyes, man. Alright, we have time for one more question. Shayne! Is Julianna King Shadow Girl? What? There are rumors going around that you and Julianna King are getting back together. Is she the woman in this picture? No comment. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Tommy, Tommy! Oh, my people. Here you go! Don't' forget: you look good, you feel good. You feel good, you fight good. You look good, you fight good. Yeah, we waiting on someone. Well Tommy, I'll get right down to business, shall I? Ha! Yeah, right. Hm. Oh shit! Yep. Get the f... Yeah, alright. Yes or no? This is some bullshit. Playing games with Bones. - Okay Kevin. - Yep. See you next week. Hi. Hi. When are you gonna quit? You don't have to work here anymore. It keeps me humble. Why did you let them think it was Julianna? What are you talking about? At the press conference when they asked you about... - Shadow Girl? - I thought you didn't show up in pictures. I don't... usually. So you're coming back? You're coming back! You... you made me feel like... like I matter. Of course you matter. Hello? Hi. Julianna? Hold on just a second. I heard we might be getting back together. I'm just kidding. Congratulations on the Suarez fight. That was pretty impressive. Thanks. Well uh, I will be rooting for you during the next one. You in town? For a few weeks, my new movie's coming out so... Anyway um, I just wanted to wish you luck. Appreciate it. Wasn't expecting her to call. Well, you are a winner again. - She sounded happy for me. - She's an actress. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that. No, I know what you meant. Hey I'm just looking out for you. Is that what you're doing? And now for the moment you've all been waiting for. The main event of the evening. Fighting out of the red corner with an undefeated record of ten wins and no loses, Tommy the Destroyer Bones. And challenging him for the first time, the former world champion fighting out of the blue corner, Shayne Blackwell! Obey my commands at all times, protect yourselves at all times. Touch gloves. This don't make you a winner. Ready? Ready? Fight! I've got a behind the scenes exclusive Blackwell training. Does it include naked shower photos? No shower photos. Well doll face, good people and hard work don't sell papers. How about this for an exclusive? Matae agrees to rematch with Blackwell. When did that happen? Ron! You got something good for me? You know anything about a rematch between Blackwell and Matae? One of my sources. I can't remember her name, but she's good. Giving you this. Either you run with it or someone else will. It's gonna be the fight of the year. Decade. Hell, if we print it it's halfway to being true anyway. Kick the embezzlement scandal off page one. They're dime a dozen. - You're telling me... - People love a good comeback story. You bet you're a... Attila! What's up, bud? - Can I get your autograph? - Yeah of course, man Dude, I'm totally pumped about the rematch. - Rematch? - Yeah. - What rematch? - Shayne Blackwell. That's pretty cool man. Alright, man. Thanks. What's this bullshit about a Blackwell rematch? How is this the first you've heard of it? Well, it's not happening. 'Cause I've already beat him. That's ridiculous. You know what? I've beat him before and I can beat him again. Fine. Just get it done so I can focus on the championship. Nice place. Come on, we've all got secrets. Carrots. You still up? I'm just checking on you. Please, be a prostitute or a dealer. Yeah? What are you wearing? Come on Ma, they're just slippers. Your other ones were worn out. Aw, I'm glad you think they're comfortable. Alright, you have a great night, Ma. I love you too. Vanessa? Oh my God, you are pregnant. Does Marjus know? What's the matter? Why aren't you happy about it? Hey, this is Shayne. Leave a message. Hey, so you were right, Vanessa's pregnant but she's not telling her husband about it. I hope she's not having an affair. Call me back. Thank you. To old times. Come on, they weren't all bad. Some things were great. They were. How's Maude? I miss her. She's doing good. So you still with that uh, big hot shot director? No, he was a producer. And no, that was a long time ago. So who's the lucky guy? Who says there's only one? I'm just kidding, there's no one. - What about you? - What about me? Who's the girl in that picture with you? Who's Shadow Girl? Nobody you'd know. Okay, well, if you're trying to make me jealous it's working. Julianna, I don't know what this is but I don't have time for games. I'm not playing. That didn't take you very long. - What are you doing here? - What? What are you doing here? - Are you spying on me? - Who are you talking to? What? Shayne, what's going on? I came for her, I didn't think you were gonna be her date. Holly! Wait up! Holly! Stop, stop! So what was that the other night? That meant nothing to you? Of course it did. So... so then what were you doing with Julianna? She called and asked if we could meet. I... I wanted to see what would happen. I have a pretty good idea. You don't get it. We've been through a lot, me and her. She doesn't care about you. - She's just... - Holly... - ...using you. - Holly... I think you're great. I wouldn't be where I am without you. But... out in the real world... you don't exist. People seeing us... People seeing us right now think I'm talking to myself like I'm some kind of crazy person. I just wanted to be straight with you, alright? You deserve a medal. And don't pretend that you didn't... You want something else out of this. You wanted to help me as a way to help yourself. Well, that may be all I can deliver. What? I couldn't find anything on Matae. - So? - So? I can't guarantee you're gonna win the fight. Yeah, of course you can. What are you... You've been fixing these fights. You wanted me to wave a magic wand so I did. - So you make me a fraud? - You didn't question the result! Is that what you think of me? Is that what you think I wanted? Get out of my sight. Shayne... Keep looking for the worst in people, I guarantee you're gonna find it. What are you doing here? Can I come in? I need to tell you something. Go ahead. The picture you took of me and that girl wasn't the reason Julianna and I broke up. It wasn't the reason I lost the fight. I think somewhere along the way I just kind of started to buy into my own hype. I felt like the world owed me something. Why try so hard, you know? I cut corners, I got lazy. I cheated. We both did, by the way. It wasn't the first time I got caught. It was most public. And when it all fell apart... I couldn't handle it. So all this time... it wasn't my fault? Well, it makes sense why it didn't work. Well, you got everything you wanted, right? Tell me how I can make it up to you. I can't. I can't. It's okay, nobody has to know. Look... I c... I care about you, Holly, but... I don't want to be that guy anymore. Look... Whatever you lost... You gotta... I gotta what? I don't know. Face whatever happened. I know what happened. My mom died and my family abandoned me. Are you sure? Am I sure? - I just meant... - Am I sure? I just think maybe there's another way to look at it. You think that I want this? Do you think that this is a choice? Do you think that I woke up one day as a twelve-year-old and decided it wasn't enough to have the one person I cared about most die and watch everybody else move on, but what I would really, really love is to have everybody start ignoring me? And slip into this weird in-between world where I don't get acknowledged by another living soul for how ever many years? You know that's not what I said. Just go. I hope you'll be there. It would mean a lot. I don't do crowds, remember? Hey! Shayne! Shayne! So where are you, huh? What happened to me never being alone? Huh? What happened to you coming whenever I needed you? Well, I need you now! Please! I don't know what to do. I don't... I don't have anywhere to go. Can someone tell me what to do? Can someone tell me what to do? Okay, I have this photo shoot and then I'll be back. How are you feeling? Ready to get in there and dominate. Great. 'Cause I don't date losers. Babe, I'm joking. Let me ask you something. Would you have called me if I hadn't fought Suarez? Yes, of course. Would you have called me if I hadn't won? Eventually, yes. Look, I'm not going to apologize to you for wanting you to be successful. Makes sense. Come on girls, let's take a picture. Dad, why do we always have to do this? - Alright, smile! - You'll thank me one day. Okay, it's good! See it wasn't too bad. Let's go. Just a sec. I wanted to come say good-bye to you. I'm not really sure how much longer I'm gonna be here. That's your third one, Vanessa. I think it's pretty clear. - Everything okay, baby? - Just a sec. You have to tell him, Ness. Just broke a nail. No, she didn't! Look, they're perfect. - You sure you're okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. I'm not leaving you like this. We make the baby? I didn't know how to tell you. She's gonna be beautiful like her mommy. I can't... I can't. - Did I say something wrong? - No, no, no, no, no... Growing up I... I... I never felt like I was good enough, or smart enough or interesting enough. My mother always played favorites, and it... it definitely wasn't me. I felt so cheated when she died. All I could count on was that I looked nice and I don't want to put that on our kid. I... Whether she's pretty or not, I... I don't... I don't ever want her to feel that's all she is. She won't. She won't. Same goes if it's a boy. Your film is really beautiful. I guess I wasn't really the best big sister, huh? You need to get out more. Oh! - I'm sorry. - Ow. - Are... are you okay, Miss? - I... I think so... I... Yeah you shouldn't stand. Uh. Here uh, do you need a hand? - I'm gonna put your arms... - Come on, Troy. - Don't put... don't put too much weight on it. - Uh. Okay. - Do you need some ice? - No. - I'm Allison - Oh, I'm Troy. - You took quite a spill. - Yeah. I don't know what happened. Yeah, I saw it. Then I thought I'd help. Why don't you date? I always thought it was because you were too busy working but I've been wrong about a few things lately. Why do you work so much? It's not like this makes you happy. That's what you look like when you're happy, Dad. Are all these to help you sleep? And then it clicked. Like the tumblers of a safe. Losing mom didn't happen just to me. It happened to all of us. You never got over her. Dad? Dad? Peter. Happy anniversary, Vicky. I know you prefer the apricot-y orange but this one was the healthiest one they had. I never realized how hard it must have been for you to go on without her. I'm sorry, Dad. I had always expected people to be there for me. But the truth was, I had never really been there for anyone else. Attila! Whoo! Come on. Would you go a little bit faster? There we go. Round two in this high round bout. Matae with a clear advantage so far but it's still early in the fight. Blackwell's strategy seems to be go straight on the offence but Matae right now is untouchable. Goes up against the fence trying to keep him from raining down strikes and that's round two. Alright, come on we gotta hurry. Shayne! You got this, baby! Attila! Knock him out! Knock him out! Matae tags Blackwell with a left, then an upper cut. That one looks like it might have done some damage. Blackwell taking some heavy blows in this third round. He isn't backing down. Come on man! Looking good, babe! - Blackwell going for the take down and he gets it. - Don't slow down! You can make the light, go! Matae gets Blackwell into a headlock hoping to turn it into a sweep. But this is not a good position for Matae. Come on man! Attila! Let's go! Let's go! Blackwell, you can do this! Come on Blackwell! Matae has clearly dominated these first three rounds. Blackwell tried to reverse the momentum, but it may not be enough. Blackwell showing signs of fatigue. Kick his ass! Kick him! Yeah! Let's go! Way to get him down! Let's go. Hey! Can you sign this? There! Whoo! Take it to him, Attila! Take it to him. Take it to him! You got this, Attila! Make him tap, Attila! Go, Shayne! This is it! Yeah! Kick him! Let's go! That's it, that's it! Attila! Knock him out! Finish him, finish him! Yeah, Attila! Come on Shayne, stay in! Don't give up! Get up! Get up! Come on, get up. You got it, come on! Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. Hey, you're doing great. You deserve to be here 'cause you're a fighter and even though you can't see me... I'm here for you, no matter what. Holly? Hi. - You're here. - Yeah. You're doing great. There's a girl in the cage. Hey, where did she come from? Who's the girl in the cage? - How'd she get in? - She part of Blackwell's crew? Who's that? - Let me check on that. - Copy that. You got this. Okay? You ready? You got this. Ready? Ready? Fight! Yes. What should I do? People are starting to complain. Get out of there! Yes! Come on, Shayne! Why won't she move? Whoo! Whoo! Looking good. Come on, Shayne! Yes! You! With the trench coat! That girl is not with Blackwell's crew. Copy that. I'm on it. Come on, Shayne! - Hey. - Yes! - Hey. - Hit him! - Ma'am! - Hit him back! Ma'am. This is a restricted area. You can't be up there. - Come on. - Come on, Shayne! - Yes, you got him! - Ma'am, ma'am, let's go. - Just give me a minute! - Let's go, it's time to go. Let's go. I'm coming. Come on Shayne! You got it! You can do it, babe! Come on! Shayne no matter what anybody says, you did it! Yeah! Ladies and gentlemen, after five rounds we go to the judges' score cards for a decision. Can I have a selfie? Harvey McIntire has forty-nine forty-six. Larry Crosby has forty-nine forty-eight. John Bromley had forty-eight forty-nine. And the winner by split decision... Attila Matae! Hey Attila, congratulations on your victory. Tell me how are you feeling? Hey, you. I'm sorry. But you did a good job. I gotta go find somebody. I know, I saw her. - Oh, hi. - Hey. Uh, great job, great win. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you very much. Pretty impressive. I um... I didn't realize I needed a ticket - 'cause I... - Hey! She's with me. She didn't have a pass or anything. Alright. You... You were amazing out there. - Um... - You came back. You were right about so many things. Not everything. What about Julianna? We ended on good terms. So she's just here to support you? In her own way. Oh, my God. I got a little blood on you, I'm sorry. That's okay. And so the spell was broken. But love was only half the journey. The rest was learning to recognize the depth, and longing, and pain of others. In short, to grow up. Holly. Hey, dad. Holly.
