-Good morning, ma'am. -Good morning, Alex. -Where's Mr. Malhotra? -He's in the garden. Roots are the most important part of any plant. Plants also breathe like you and me. You have to treat them with lots of love. Here! Now this plant has a new home! Here, this is for you. Thank you. You're welcome. Are they coming? Yes, sir. All four of them? Yes. Their flight must be landing in Athens, now. Thank you, Samara. Yes, sir. Only 50 Lakhs, Vikram. That's all I need. "Dear, Vikram, I've decided to make such a film that that will be the biggest film in world's history. And you are the only eligible person who can be its lead actor. If you can come to Samos this Friday then we can finalize the deal. Kabir Malhotra." Good evening and welcome to News At Nine, election bulletin. Breaking news! A shocking interview with the most popular Prime Ministerial candidate, Mr. O. P. Ramsay, who walked out of the interview when questioned about his party's funds. Sir, can you tell us who the source of your party's seemingly unending funds are? Where's all the money coming from? You know, you know, it's very sad that you ask me this question. I'm offended. I'm offended for my people. Sir are you choosing not to answer the question? You're damn right. I'm refusing to answer this question. Sir, why are you choosing not to answer the question? Sir, don't say anything! -Sir, where is the money coming from? -Please, this interview is over. Escort her outside. Please stop the camera. We are finished! How did that get on TV? We're finished! No, we are not. Just relax. Here, have these. Did you not hear what she was saying? Didn't you hear what she said? Today we are questioned about the source of our funds! These allegations can be dangerous. I heard everything, sir. But there's a way to prove their allegations wrong. What way? "Honorable Mr. Ramsay. The way you have made your way to the political heights, I admire that. I believe Malhotra Inc. and your People's Party, can join together and push Thailand's economy to new highs. If you can come to Samos, this Friday, we can discuss all the details of it. Kabir Malhotra." Kabir Malhotra. Yes, sir. The tycoon. Shipping, airlines, pharmaceuticals, publishing. His net worth 16 billion dollars. -But is he clean? -100% clean. And right now, sir, we need a clean source of funds. Fine. Inform him that we'll reach Samos on Friday. Not we, sir. Only you. The invitation is for you alone. The next time you're caught driving under the influence you'll be Her Majesty's guest for a lot longer. Thank you, officer. The channel called. I told them you are not well. Thanks. It's the third time this month. Till when do I have to keep lying? Sweetheart, please let me help you. Ever since Vandana left us... Dad, please! Could you just leave mom out of this? Please! So... What's next? I'm going to Samos. Samos? "Dear Tisha, Every journalist wants such a story in their career, which will make them famous for eternity. If you can come to Samos, this Friday then a story that is the biggest scandal of the past ten years, and all the evidences related to that story can be yours. I look forward to seeing you." "Kabir Malhotra." Kabir Malhotra, the billionaire? Yes, Dad. Why? Are you surprised that he chose me for this story? I think... I think, you should go. Neil! Ranbir! Where are you? Listen to me. You get underground quickly. Colombians are looking for you everywhere. They've reached your house. Ranbir, do you have a nose on your face? What? Do you have a nose? Of course, I have a nose, Neil. Then use it, my friend. Breathe. Buddy! We have to return 20 million in the next four days or else we are dead. Oh, no, no, Ranbir First, they'll torture us. Then extract our teeth and pull our nails. They'll break our fingers, and then maybe, maybe, gouge out our eyes with hot iron rods... Stop kidding, Neil! Why don't you understand? There's no money. -Don't you get it? We don't-- -have the money. I know. Man! They are really angry. Not as angry as me, Ranbir. They've parked their car in my parking spot. Don't... drop that. "Dear Mr. Menon, In the Istanbul entertainment sector the success that you have achieved in such a less time is quite appreciable. Why don't you and I get together and in whole Europe, open a chain of nightclubs? Arranging funds will be my responsibility. If this proposal excites you, then come to Samos, this Friday. Trust me it will be worth your time." "Kabir Malhotra." Hello again. Neil, what are you doing? Just leave town now! Okay, Ranbir. How can I say 'no' to you? Good! And please, think about how we'll get the 20 million. Don't worry! I have the check. I just need to encash it. Sir, they have reached the island. Thank you, Samara. And the game begins. Good afternoon. Welcome to Samos. My name is Samara Shroff. And I'm Mr. Kabir Malhotra's executive assistant. Alex will bring your luggage. Please follow me. Mr. Ramsey, there's no mobile network on this island. What do you mean "There's no network"? How do I contact someone? Via satellite. Mr. Kabir Malhotra has a satellite phone. Mr. Kabir Malhotra, the billionaire, lives here? I mean, does he own this complete island? That's right. Mr. Malhotra has purchased this island. He has taken the responsibility to look after the villages on this island. Wow, they must really love him. They do. This way, please. Teresa will take you to your rooms. Please excuse me. This way, please. Three years, Mallika. I've waited three years for this moment. Come in! Sir? They are here. I'll meet them in the library. Yes, sir. 1787, Chateau Bordeaux. It's from the third American President Thomas Jefferson's personal collection. Only 160 thousand dollars. Alex. And this. It's priceless. White Caedonia. The only plant in the world that blooms once every 80 years! It'll blossom tomorrow. Come. Good afternoon. Let me introduce myself to you all. I am Kabir Malhotra. And you, Mr. Ramsay, you traffic girls, a pimp. You, Mr. Menon, Drug smuggler. and you, Mr. Kapoor, a murderer. How dare you? Do you know who you're talking to? What do you mean by all this? He's talking nonsense. Hey, you! Put that down. Turn it off and put it down! Okay, relax. Sit down. I will not! Sit down! Please. This was just a trailer. The film will begin, now. This story began 20 years ago. There was a small girl. Innocent, naive-- Just a minute. Why are you telling all this to us? What's the connection? There is a connection, Mr. Ramsay. As I was saying, circumstances turned that innocent girl into an orphan at the age of six. And for a mere two thousand rupees, she was sold to an orphanage in Thailand. For 2000 rupees! That orphanage belonged to you, Mr. Ramsay. That is utter nonsense! We don't buy children. They're put into our care. Really? A six-year-old girl was sent to Thailand. She was thrust into such a world, that would probably be, more terrifying than a nightmare. In learning how to survive that world, her innocence and childhood, both got lost. All that remained, was just her body. That she now began to sell. The more money she earned, the more profit the owner earned. Her owner? To the world he was a noble social worker. But behind that facade lay his true identity. Is that right, Mr. Ramsay? Enough of this nonsense. This is libel. I will sue you! I'll destroy you. But how would you leave the island? -Sit down, O. P. -Hey! That's Mr. Ramsey to you. Mr. Ramsey. Do you think we were invited here, just to be an audience to this show? There's more, isn't there? Sit, sit. All right. Fine! At the very first opportunity, she escaped with the help of one European client. Thinking that, now all will be fine. But with good intentions life doesn't get better. So, what happened to the girl? That girl, all alone without any support, reached an unknown city. Istanbul. Istanbul. Enter Mr. Neil Menon. She reached Istanbul's biggest night club. Which was owned by Neil Menon. She was hired as a dancer. But that was just a sham. Mr. Menon's real business was selling drugs. And then, that girl was also forced into selling the drugs. isn't that right, Mr. Menon? Absolutely wonderful! You know, I was just about to say that all this is false, you are mistaken. But that'd just be a waste of my time. I'm dying to know what happens next. A few months later, she went to India. A country where she was born, and the country where she had to die. What? That's it? End of story? Excuse me, could you please tell me-- Mr. Kapoor, August 22nd, 2007. Vikram? Vikram, so you knew her? No, he did not know her. But she was killed by him. This is ridiculous. And who told you all of this? Mr. Kapoor, money is a kind of thing, which allows you to buy anybody anytime. For instance, your make-up man Elton Ferreira. Viks, calm down! Three years ago, the great Vikram Kapoor, was returning from a party. Heavily drunk, but still wanted to drive, And then, one innocent girl came under his car. Oh, my God, Vikram. What have you done? That was an accident. But what happened next, wasn't an accident. Look, sir, this is all lie. It's all a lie. Is it really a lie, Mr. Kapoor? This is bad. This is really bad. Please, Vikram, please, we'll have to take her to a hospital. -Please listen to me. -No. I cannot do that. My career... Anyways, she's dead. It'll make no difference. But bad luck doesn't let go easily. That girl was not dead. There was life left in her. And in spite of knowing that... you buried her alive. Do you have any proofs for this? Or it's just-- I don't fancy writing stories. I am sorry, but who was that girl? She... was my daughter. Mallika's and mine. Mallika? Mallika, came into my life 26 years ago. I was in love with her. But I did not marry her. One day, I just walked away from her. Never to return again. So when did you got to know that she was your and Mallika's daughter? Three years ago, after my sister Shreeja died, I found a letter. Which Mallika had written to Shreeja after I had left. From that letter, I got to know that Mallika was pregnant. Later, she had two girls. Twins. Twins? Then, where is your other daughter? You are my other daughter. What? This is ridiculous. I mean-- This is true, Tisha. As in, I don't know what game you're trying to play but let me tell you that I have a mother and a father. I know you have parents. But do you have a picture with them, when you were born? Name of the hospital where you were born? Why is that their blood groups are are O -ve and B +ve while yours is AB -ve? You are my daughter, Tisha. And this is your twin sister, Maya. -But her face doesn't-- -Doesn't match. It happens, fraternal twins. Twins, but not identical. And it is said that twins don't give birth to twins. Just stop this, please! I'm sorry but I can't take this any more. I can't believe this nonsense. You do a mistake and we pay for it! That's right! All three of you will be punished. Over the past three years I've collected evidence against you all. Tomorrow morning at seven, when the international Vigilance Squad officers arrive here, all evidences and proofs will be handed over to them. Basically all three of you are completely finished! You never mentioned Maya before. I'm so sorry. Sir, I probably shouldn't be saying this but these are powerful people. If your allegations prove to be wrong, they'll destroy you. How will they do it? I was ruined three years ago itself. Tisha? Go away. Listen to me. Go away. Just leave me alone. Please listen to me. I've got everything. But... But still I feel very lonely. And now apart from you, I have nobody. How selfish can you be? And now you think you can buy me with your money? -You're my daughter. -Daughter? What do you know about this relationship? Nothing, right? What was that you said there? Yes, money is the kind of thing that allows you to buy anything, anybody. Here's some news for you! I am not for sale. -You misunderstood me. -It's you who've misunderstood. You thought that bringing them here ruining their lives, everything would be fine? The truth is, Mr. Malhotra, if there's a real culprit here, it's you! I know. You hate me. But not as much as I hate myself. I don't hate you. You're a stranger. My happiness, my life, even hatred it makes no difference to me, if you're alive or dead. Now please get out of here. I'm sorry Mallika. I'm sorry. I am likable I have a good heart I am a bud I have grown up In fragrances Of colors Fragrance of my body Color is flowing Why have I become a teaser? Does anybody know? What a beauty? Is it a shade or sunlight? You are a delicate bud Who are you? Tell us You are a sweet smelling youth This story is full of colors You have just blossomed To the ones you met What kind of black bees were there? Tell us How can I tell this story? Someone like says here Bygone yesterday Bygone moments You remove from your heart gradually Even if this bud is gone tomorrow There's nothing to worry There are many buds and flowers On the road Where ever you go Where ever you see Buds of faces blossom there Look Body is sweet smelling Body color is flowing Hey, teaser Who are you? Tell us What a beauty? Is it a shade or a sunshine? Hey, delicate bud, who are you? Tell us Sweet smelling you are full of youth This story will be full of colors You have just blossomed To the ones you met What kind of black bees were there? Tell us How I can tell you my story? Some one says like this here By gone yesterday By gone moments You remove from your heart gradually Just tell us Damn it. Smoking is not allowed here, Mr. Menon. Do you always wake up so early or is it something special today? No. I always get up early. It's good. A healthy lifestyle. It's a pity you won't be able to see tonight's celebration. it's Mr. Malhotra's birthday. The people of Samos have organized a splendid fireworks display. Yesterday's blast is still echoing. So, no thanks. Is that a gunshot? Mr. Malhotra. Mr. Malhotra? Mr. Malhotra! Mr. Malhotra? I don't understand this. What's going on? I heard a gunshot. The key is in the keyhole but he never locks the door. Malhotra! -Did you give him tea in the morning? -Yes, ma'am. -Was the door open? -Yes. Open the door, Mr. Malhotra. We'll have to break it. Get me something, quick! Hammer. Come on! Quick! Come on. Oh, no! Sir. Ma'am, the lVS Officers are here. Sunil, get the whole team here. Sia. Rigor mortis is just about starting to set in. I'd place the time at no more than two hours ago. So about 0700 hours. Okay. Bag the body. -Sia. -Yes? We've got Mr. Malhotra's medical report. He had pancreatic cancer. Last stage. He was dying any way. Let's watch this. I can't believe this nonsense. You do a mistake and we pay for it! That's right! All three of you will be punished. Over the last three years I've collected evidence against you. And tomorrow at seven, when the International Vigilance Squad officers arrive here all proofs and evidences, will be handed over to them. Basically all three of you are completely finished! The facts are, the only way in and out of this room is through the door. The pistol was owned by Mr. Malhotra's himself. And the 9 mm bullet pistol and Malhotra's injuries are a perfect match. There are traces of gun powder on the fingers. And if the bullet was fired while sitting here, then the bullet's direction and the pistol landing on the floor are consistent. Correct. it's suicide. That's right. It's suicide. Unless, unless Mr. Malhotra already knew that his life was in danger and that's why he called us here to Samos. And his four guests, against whom he's levied serious allegations. It could probably be one of them. O. P. Ramsay, Thailand's Prime Ministerial Candidate. And has everything to lose. Vikram Kapoor, good actor. But is he a murderer too? And if that's true, then it'll be the end of his career. Neil Menon. His name should be at the top of world's every 'most wanted' list. But he's very smart. Tisha Khanna or should I say Malhotra? After knowing the truth about her life, did her hatred grow so much that she killed him? And now she would inherit all this wealth. Tisha's name was in the will of Mr. Malhotra. But Sia the will was found burnt in the dustbin. Sunil, where is the evidence that Mr. Malhotra had mentioned? We're still looking. Why would Mr. Malhotra want to kill himself? Let's go and talk to his guests. I'm Sia Agnihotri. Chief investigating Officer, IVS. And this is Sunil Srivastava. So Mr. Menon, we don't see around of late. Really? Have you ever thought of wearing a spectacle? -May I? -No, you may not. Where were you when the gun was fired? Look, I don't have time for these stupid things. When can I leave? At that time, I was in the hall with Samara. When did you saw him last? Last night. He came to my room. Seeking forgiveness. And? I told him to go to hell. And guess what? He listened to me. Who has the other key to the door? Key? That was the only key. You see, he never used to lock the door. Key was there for just namesake. Did you break the door? I tried to break it. Then? I broke the glass pane using the candle stand. So as to open the door from inside. And then we reached inside and saw-- That he was dead. He had shot himself here in his head. Of course, he was dead! What all did you touch in the room? I felt his neck to check his pulse. Why do you think Kabir Malhotra accused you? Don't know, maybe for publicity. I haven't even killed a mosquito in my life, ma'am. Well, that makes you the only such person in this world. And yes, there was a jug of water on the desk. I doused the fire in the dustbin with that. What do you think? Why did he burn the will? He burned the will? Listen, I don't know anything about his will. I've not even seen it. He wanted to buy me. But I told him, I'm not for sale. Is that the reason why he killed himself? I don't know. He spent the last three years planning for this day. He used to say, he would get peace only after destroying these three men. I never thought that he would mean this by "peace". Yes, sir. Right, sir. Right, sir. What did Mr. Ravenscar say? He says we should let them go. Sunil, where are those evidences? Have they been stolen or burnt by someone? I mean, where is it? Maybe he didn't have any evidence. Maybe. Now what? What now? We have nothing against them except for Mr. Malhotra's accusations. Not one single piece of evidence. For the first time I'm so happy to leave a place. I don't understand this. What happened to the evidence that he was talking about? Was there even any evidence to begin with? if you ask me, Kabir Malhotra was a lunatic. First he tried to trap us but when he failed, he bloody killed himself! It's not over. It's not over. We'll keep an eye on each of them. And Sunil, mark my words we'll get them. Whatever is there in the tape, start investigating that. Begin surveillance on all. I want to know every move they make. Especially, Mr. Neil Menon. Tens of thousands of Thai's poured into Bangkok over the past week, demanding fresh elections. Damn it! You're shot! Sorry! You're bleeding profusely. I have to do this. What? Tell me what? My phone. Speed dial 1. Hello! One minute. Ranbir. Main kitchen freezer. We have a problem. Hurry up. Wake up. Stay with me, okay? Look at me. Look at me, all right? Look at me. Listen to me. I'm not going to let you die. Name... What's your name? Maya. Maya? Just Maya. Just Maya. What is a nice girl like you, doing in my nasty club? Please, don't say anything, okay? Hey! Don't! Stay with me. Stay with me! Wake up! Okay. Stay with me. Please don't! Hang on! Your friends are here. Neil! Neil! Need to get him to a hospital. No. Home. I need to take him home. You're okay. You're going to be okay now. Quickly, go get some help. Stay. It's okay. I'm right here, okay! Right here! You're going to be fine. We're almost there. Stay with me. Neil? Neil! I never thought this could ever happen Two strangers would meet on the way If the two of us Come together... The heart is happy And surprised at the same time I never thought this could ever happen Don't know where This life has brought me? Don't know why I met you Stay. The heart is happy And surprised at the same time I'm falling I'm falling in love with you I'm falling I'm falling in love with you I never thought this could ever happen Two strangers would meet on the way Don't know why Don't know why I met you The heart is happy And surprised at the same time I'm falling I'm falling in love with you I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling in love with you This is a world of dreams There is sunlight in looks Moon-like beauty Wherever you are I am there also Heart begot heart Got friendly just like me We met and this happened This beautiful environment Is scattered all along Our hearts blossomed And this happened The sweet smelling murmuring wind I wish this environment remains as it is I'm falling I'm falling in love with you I'm falling in love with you I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling in love with you I'm falling I'm falling I'm falling in love with you I'm falling I'm falling in love There are so many things about me, which you don't know about. And what I know is enough for me. All has not been smooth sailing for Mr. Ramsay, who has been facing severe flak for his disproportionate income. On his arrival from Samos, Mr. Ramsay provided some insight into his mysterious benefactor. Keep calm. Keep calm! I think it should be about Samos. Sir, but what about Mr. Kabir Malhotra's death? It has been a devastating experience. The loss of a dear dear friend and a visionary. Mr. Kabir Malhotra, you know, was not just interested in funding the party but he was also interested in the future of Thailand. And he truly believed, that the new political party is the future of Thailand. This... This is a personal loss. That's right, O. P. It just got personal. Good. -Aiden, keep me updated. -Right. Sunil? He's moving! Alright I sighted! I'm... Sia! Aiden, what's happening? I don't believe this. This was planned. Bloody don't believe this! Sia, Ravenscar wants to see you. Now. I want Neil Menon. Find him. You can't take on the might of people like an O. P. Ramsay or a Neil Menon. Simply on the words of a disgruntled old man. Drop it, Sia. Now! Sir, Neil has just skipped surveillance. -He's just skipped what? -Surveillance, sir. And on whose authority did you commission this surveillance? I felt, if we watched them they could lead us to the evidence. Ms. Agnihotri! Let me make myself absolutely clear. The Samos case is closed. -But, sir-- -Closed. Do you understand? And kill the surveillance, now! At last, the power... Is now in our hands. Now it's our turn, Karamveer. Now we rule. Power! Power! Power! I think this is great. Of course, we win. This is great. Let's go check the other side. Bravo! I'll just be back. Hello. Congratulations, O. P. Thank you. Thank you very much. May I ask, who's calling? Forget about who I am and tell me, how much do you love the position that has been given to you? Sir, they're waiting. I'm sorry? You'll have to say sorry to the people of Thailand if I disclose the truth to them. Truth? What are you talking about? The adventures of O. P. Ramsay. The file that Mr. Kabir Malhotra had on you is with me now. Which file are you talking about? O. P. I'll call back in two hours to tell you what I want in return for the file. Who was he? How the hell should I know? We need to think about it with a calm mind. I mean, what's the guarantee that he has that file? For a start, that file is not with me. Sir, please just, just calm down. Don't you tell me to calm down! Do you know what's in those files? Every detail connecting the orphanages to the prostitution! All the evidence against me! Everything is in it! If this story goes out, I'll be finished! So don't you dare tell me to calm down! Kabir Malhotra is responsible for this. If he hadn't committed suicide I would've killed him myself. I swear! Sir, but we erased all the evidences. I don't care, Karamveer! Go out there and if anybody has any kind of evidence against me, go out and destroy it. Now go! I'm going, sir. I'll take care of it. I'll tackle it. Hello. Hello! Now that's what I call the perfect confession. What confession? -How do you---After five minutes don't forget to watch the news. Quite a sensational news is going to be aired. Sia, it's the news. You've got to see this. It's bloody priceless. I don't know how we are getting this but we have live footage of Mr. Ramsay the Prime Minister-in-waiting. Every detail connecting the orphanages to the prostitution! All the evidence against me! If this story leaks out, I am finished! So, don't you dare tell me to calm down! You understand? He's rigged this room. This whole place is bloody bugged! What's the guarantee that he's got the file? Kabir is responsible for this. If he hadn't committed suicide, I would've killed. Karamveer! But we've erased all the evidences. I don't care! Go out there and if anybody has any kind of evidence against me go and destroy it now! I'm going, sir. I'll take care of it. It's incredible because this evening the People's Party won a landslide victory. Mr. O. P. Ramsay was declared as Thailand's first ethnic Prime Minister. For those who have just tuned in... Sir, Camera! Oh, my God! Sir! Mr. O. P. Ramsay is seen most distressed... Damn it! Sir! Is anybody there? Call the doctor! Call the doctor! Breathe, take deep breaths, sir. Sir! Sir! Sir! Shit! It's an emergency, call the doctor! Guards! Sir! Sir, breath! Breath! We seem to have lost the feed but this is incredible. Mr. O. P. Ramsay, the Prime Minister-in-waiting has been caught confessing on camera... Welcome back! Mr. Neil Menon. Neil Menon? What are you talking about? This could be the opposition's ploy. How would they know about the file? It's Neil, I just know it. Sia! Call from Mumbai Police HQ for you. Line three in my cabin. Yes? What? Elton? In a suitcase? Oh, shit! Okay. Okay, thanks. Mumbai. -Mumbai? -Yes! Why not Bangkok? You were saying... Neil is done with Bangkok. He's going to move. And the Mumbai police have found the body of Elton Ferreira. Who? Elton? Elton Ferreira, Sunil! Remember his name was there on the tape? Mr. Malhotra said, Elton was with Vikram the night Maya was killed. He's dead now. Sia, listen we need to inform Captain Ravenscar. We will. Of course, we'll inform him. But only after arresting Neil Menon. And I'm sure we'll get him in Mumbai. Sunil, I need to see you at the car park in five minutes. Okay, done. Please. Please. Please don't. Please. Cut it, friend! Hey, Vikram, why did you cut it? It was a good shot. it was really a pathetic shot. Give me ten minutes, we'll do one more. Give service light! We'll do one more. Get some tea. -Pappu! -Stars -Sir, the costume for the next shot. -Get lost. At the Global Warming Summit in Italy's capital, Rome, all countries have reached a consensus.

First it was industrialist Kabir Malhotra and now Elton Ferreira. We gotta see how it his new release, Chase. As you can see we are standing outside Vikram Kapoor's house. He's not at his home right now. It's surprising that even his servants are not around. Looks like he is here. What do you have to say about Elton's murder? Keep driving, go ahead. Why didn't lodge a complaint? Sir, do you know who killed Elton? Sir, tell us, your name is involved in this murder case. Sir! Cheers! You? What are you doing here? And how did you get in? Anybody here? Vinod, Suresh! What do you want? Why are you here? I want to see fear in your eyes. What? The same fear that you must have seen in Maya's eyes when you buried her alive. It was just an accident, Neil. Then, this is also an accident. Now. Now I can see that fear. Please. Why are you doing all this? Because I loved her. Hello, Andheri police station. Hello? Hello?

Vikram Kapoor is dead. He was found in his house with slashed wrists, but his body has severe signs of violence. Sir, Neil Menon is on a killing spree. Eliminating all the witnesses from that weekend. Did I not give you a direct order to drop that case and to drop Neil Menon? If you could listen to me. No, you listen to me. I want you off that case. Right now. I will see you in my office tomorrow. Sir. Sir, if someone in our department is protecting Neil Menon-- That will be enough, Ms. Agnihotri. What did he say? What he was asked to say. Sir, your mail. Turn it around! Your flight to Mumbai leaves in two hours. Our person will get in touch with you. He will brief you about what to do next. Do you really want this? Neil!

Ramsay. -Guilty. -And Vikram Kapoor? I made him confess to the cops. That's all? Yeah, that's all. In fact, I wasn't even there when he killed himself. Then how do you know, he's dead? Only the police know about this. I'm sure you have a phone. Trust me, no tricks. 0-0-4-4 7-7-7 9-4-6 0-2-4-1. May I? Now what is it, Sia? Good evening, Mr. Ravenscar. You? What the heck are you doing there? I had no choice. I was right. You've been bought. Haven't you? For God's sakes! It's not what you think, Sia. This horrible creature you have in front of you is Major Arjun Singhania, lnternational Vigilance Squad. Deep undercover in the Turkish drug cartel. Major Arjun Singhania? And he outranks you. So please be nice. And now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get back to my work. You are a police officer? Even I hate surprises. Okay. What do I call you? Neil or Arjun? Neil is fine. Let's not complicate this case any further. Drink? No thanks. I'm working. To murder. Murder? You also think Kabir Malhotra was murdered? Humans have strange habits. For instance, when they drink and smoke at the same time, their glass is in their non-dominant hand. Like Kabir Malhotra, I am left-handed too. Oh, my God! You're right. And if he was left-handed-- Why did he shoot himself with his right hand? He was murdered. But who did it? There's a well known phrase in Latin. Cui bono? Who benefits? Exactly. We need to re-examine all the evidences. We'll meet at the airport in an hour. Why are you doing this for Kabir Malhotra? I'm not doing it for him. Neil, this is Mark and Aiden. They're on the Malhotra case, too. Here's the details on the will you asked for. Oh, and Samara came by, she dropped off the blue prints and documents that you wanted. I still can't believe that you are a police officer. I swear! Will was divided in three parts. Mr. Malhotra had give one part to few charities as donation. One million Euro for his staff and the rest was for Tisha. But now that will is burnt. Which means, legally, Mr. Malhotra had died without making a will. It means that-- All his wealth will belong to his lone heir. -Tisha gets everything. -Correct. How much exactly is everything? Ten billion Euro. Sia, it's Tisha. She tried to kill herself this morning. She did, what? Attempted suicide, sir. She's at St. Marks' hospital right now. What the bloody hell is going on? Sia, you go the hospital. We'll meet at the headquarters later. Let's go. I'm sorry, but I need to ask Tisha a few questions. -Is there a problem, officer? -No. It's just routine. I'll wait. Dad. That's fine, thank you. Tisha, what happened? I... I don't know. Why did you try to kill yourself? What? I did not try to kill myself. Honey, you tried to hang yourself from the fan. No, Dad! I was watching TV and... suddenly I don't know what happened but I fell unconscious and... What's going on? Dad! You need to tell me! I really need to know. What is all this? This is going to have to wait. Can you please step outside? Sure. What does this mean? Why would someone want to kill Tisha? Look, Mr. Khanna, it's very important that you do exactly as I say. You'll never guess, Tisha was attacked. But she's all right now. But you asked Mr. Khanna to tell everybody that his daughter is dead. How did you know? Because it's what I would've said. One thing's clear, that the murderer is hiding somewhere. Or else Tisha is lying. So we don't suspect her. Yes, it's possible. What would anyone get by killing Tisha? Ten billion Euro. Sunil, find out from Mr. Malhotra's lawyer who inherits the money after Tisha? Correct. That's it, right? The question is who would want to kill Tisha? No. The question is still the same. Who would want to kill Mr. Malhotra? Chelsea. Chelsea? What? You guys don't follow football? Chelsea has to win if they want to stay on top of the table. Unbelievable. I need some fresh air. Hopeless. Football? 22nd August, 2007. You have two new messages. First Message. Neil, Ranbir here. Call me back. Second message. Neil. It's been three months now. You keep saying that you'll come. I guess it was naive of me to believe you. Anyway, I had called to tell you that... I'm pregnant. I'm sure that this is the last thing you want to hear. Neil, whatever good that has happened in my life has happened after meeting you. And I will always love you for that. The number you've dialed is currently switched off. The number you've dialed is currently switched off. Neil! Who won? Chelsea won! Chelsea! Chelsea! Neil, Mr. Malhotra's lawyer has sent a fax. After Tisha everything will go to the Malhotra family. The Malhotra family. Iqbal Chand Malhotra? Kabir Malhotra's brother who who was disowned by their father. But why? I guess he must've been the black sheep. And then, Kabir also must have not helped him so he must be very upset. What are you searching for? Do you know how this red paper and these chemicals are connected? No. Why? Mustard has the same effect on me. Mustard? Shall we go to Mumbai? To meet Iqbal Chand Malhotra. I was going to say the same thing. See you in 15 minutes. The ward is upstairs. Mr. Malhotra is asleep now. But you can still see him. -How long has he been here? -From five years. Stomach cancer. Last stage. In the last five years, has he ever gone out of the hospital? This is a sanatorium, Ms. Agnihotri, not a jail. Patients are free to move. But, as far as I know, Mr. Malhotra has never been out. Who all come to visit him? No one. He's all alone. Earlier his daughter used to send him a letter every week. -Now that has also stopped. -Why? She died, poor thing. It was a car accident, January 2006. Since then he hasn't spoken with anyone. Poor man all broken down. I understand. What was his daughter's name? Natasha. Yes, Natasha Malhotra. Ma'am, may I get a copy of Mr. Malhotra's admission form and medical reports? Why not? But it will take some time. I'll have to go through some of the old files. Sure. I will have someone call you later. -Is that okay? -No problem Thank you. We are done. Let's go. -Thank you so much. -You're welcome. One thing is clear. Iqbal Chand Malhotra is not the murderer. Right. But he was the reason for it. You know, being cryptic suits you. But not in this case. Straight talk! His daughter's letter? She's dead, Neil. When? January, 2006. Then what is this? If his daughter died in January, then how did she write this letter in June? This means Natasha Malhotra is the murderer. But where is she? -You? -Good evening. How did you come in? From the door. I'm sorry. -Is there something wrong? -Yeah. I prefer the next piece, it's a... A lot more dramatic. I don't understand. Five years ago, Samara Shroff joined Kabir Malhotra's empire as his executive assistant. He didn't know her. But... Samara knew him very well. Because she was his brother Iqbal Chand Malhotra's daughter. Isn't that right, Natasha? Natasha? Mr. Menon, what kind of a joke is this? Kabir Malhotra had cancer. After his death, all his wealth would go to your dad. It was essential to ensure that nobody came in between this simple arrangement. And from the last five years... You were maintaining that. I don't know, what you're talking about. Mr. Malhotra did not know that the day he was telling us the truth... Where is your other daughter? It's biggest blow... You are my other daughter Was hit on you. How dare you? What do you think of yourself? As soon as you learnt about Tisha it became necessary for Kabir to die as soon as possible. Before he could change his will. You thought when the police arrived and found guests like us here, you would show them the recording. You do wrong and we get punished! That's right! Who in their right minds would suspect you? Wait a minute! Are you saying that I killed Mr. Malhotra? That day, like everyday... -Good morning, Mr. Malhotra. -Good morning. You went to his room. Here's your mail. When you saw that he wasn't looking at you, you used the opportunity, with his own pistol, with great precision, shot him. You shot him in cold blood. This is absurd. Maybe, you have forgotten that when the bullet was fired, I was standing with you. -No. -What? You were standing with me, when we heard the gun shot. Was that a gunshot? Your plan was good. Only two things were required. One, one witness, who could vouch that when the gun was fired you were with him. Do you always get up early or is it something special today? And two, a small burst. And because on that day a display of magnificent fireworks was organized, it wasn't difficult getting a fire cracker. Smoking is not allowed here, Mr. Menon. It's a pity that you will not be able to see tonight's celebrations. Yesterday's blast is still echoing. So, no thanks. Brilliant. And if you are done with the story, please get out of my house! Your house? But I guess, this is not your house. It's Tisha's. And I guess, Tisha is no more. What do you think? Only you can blindfold people? Tisha is alive. I'm very happy to hear that! By the way if you people have any kind of proof... We have proof. Your fingerprints. What? You heard me. Your fingerprints, are on the key. When we were knocking on the door... Mr. Malhotra? Mr. Malhotra? You said that the key was in the keyhole. Key is in the keyhole, but he never locks the door. And we believed you. And when you realized I was going to break the door, you played your trick, Hammer! Quick, come on! Is this your proof? Of course, my fingerprints would be on the key. I turned the key to open the door, remember? Yes. I remember. Then explain this. If the key was already in the keyhole, then how did your fingerprints, get on the middle barrel of the key? I mean, if you had only turned the key like you just said, then your fingerprints wouldn't have been there, right? The truth is, when you broke the pane and put your hand in, the key was already in your hand. This is a lie. I didn't do... Natasha Malhotra, you are hereby arrested on the charges of murder of... Don't even think about it. Kabir? No. Iqbal Chand Malhotra. The mastermind of this whole game. That's right. Keep your pistol on the table. Out. You too, Mr. Menon. If I had a pistol with me, you wouldn't have been alive. In that case, thank you for not carrying a gun. Natasha? Her gun. Can I ask you something, Mr. Menon? When did you piece the puzzle together? In the hospital. If I hadn't seen the photographs, I wouldn't have known that you and Kabir were identical. And people say that twins don't give birth to twins. It's over Malhotra. The game is over. Your game is over. You made a huge mistake coming here alone. Natasha, go and wait for me in the boat. Some things aren't meant to be done in the presence of children. It may have a bad effect on their minds. Natasha! -Trust me, you don't wanna do this. -Shut up. Natasha, go! Natasha! Don't say I didn't give you a chance later. Natasha, I said, leave now! -Feeling better? -Much better, thanks. Tell me something, how did you even suspect that it wasn't a gunshot? I'm allergic to gunpowder. Especially, the type that are used in fireworks. It just... shoots up my nose. Like mustard. That's it then. What a story. A father who did everything for his daughter, and a daughter who did everything for her father. Quite a faithful kind of people, these Malhotras. Do you ever get serious? Only once. You are trapped in the conspiracy Have a look in the dark You are trapped in the conspiracy Have a look in the dark What is going to happen? What's there to lose? How are these dangers spread all around? Does anyone say anything? Does one remain hidden? Whose shadows are those on the wall? Some face is hidden behind a face Just see this if you can Some face is hidden behind a face Just see this if you can Who is that stranger? Who is that stranger? A slight whisper of his appearance is making me on Who it is will be known Let the darkness reduce Who ever he is He is an enemy Think what is to be done This is a bloody claw It is such a trap How it is fluttering Some face is hidden behind a face Just see this if you can Some face is hidden behind a face Just see this if you can Who is this stranger? Who is this stranger? You are engulfed in a conspiracy Have a look in the dark What is going to happen? What is there to lose? How are these dangers spread all around? Does anyone say anything? Does one remain hidden? Whose shadows are on the walls? Some face is hidden behind a face Just see this if you can Some face is hidden behind a face Just see this if you can Who is That stranger?
