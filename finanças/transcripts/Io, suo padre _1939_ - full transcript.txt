I, HIS FATHER 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9… out! Did you see that whack? On the 7th round, he deflated like a balloon! Bravo, Masetto! Masetto Tonelli has beaten Alfredo Rocchetti by knockout! Hurray, Masetto! Bravo, Masetto! Papa… Bravo, Masetto! What are you doing? Bravo, Masetto! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Are you Masetto's coach? - Me? His father. Well done! Make way! Make way! Let us pass! Go on and take a shower! Masetto! I'll wait for you outside! Masetto won, not because he was stronger, but because he has more technique. And he owes this to his father. Is this champion coming or not? He doesn't even know we're waiting. He'll pass this way: there's only one door. Yes, but he might even get out at 2:00. Such a bore! - "Such a bore!" Besides, it's cool here. - You could've called him. Sorry but we've been only waiting for 15 minutes. But Sandro, you don't understand. With Renata's temper… - Idiot! 15 minutes is an eternity. It was impossible to shake Masetto's hand to express my feelings. These "phonetics" are crazy! You can't imagine how they elbowed me. I can. - A nice hit, eh? You didn't expect the 7th round, didn't you? What an apotheosis! Of course. Mind you, it had to end like that. But the other's tough. He knows his trade. Masetto is 20 and doesn't have those tricks. Tricks? You saw how he wore him down? Please, he knows his profession. After all, he's your kid. You too, in your day, without much fanfare in the papers, won your battles the same way. If the boy hadn't had you… Eh, Masetto is like me. Boxing's in his blood. Maybe that's why his poor mother, was scared about it when she was pregnant. She was afraid I would come home beaten badly. "Romoletto, watch out. Romoletto, go easy. Romoletto, cut it out." She expected me to box like a young miss! Because in those days, women didn't come to matches. If she did, she would've passed out. Women in the old days! Today's girls laugh if you got a swollen eye. And if you get mad, they make the other one swell. Come on, Masetto! The Cavaliere wants to say hi. - Here I am, Papa! Hey, Masetto! We're here too. Sorry, eh? Cavaliere, let's wait outside and get some fresh air. Let him say hi to his friends. There's always time for his father. Bye, Mr Romolo. - Congratulations. Cavaliere? - At ease! Hey, guys! - Hi, Masetto! Bravo. And now, be strong for the championship. Look, I saw Sandro in the theater with pretty women. - As usual. They're waiting to congratulate you. Have fun. - Thanks. Masetto, don't make a mistake, eh? - Don't worry. Bye! - Here's Masetto! Good night, Masetto! - Goodbye, champion! Masetto, let me say that… - Masetto! It's Sandro. Go say hi. - Excuse me. Sandro Busatti. He was a good center forward. Now he's forward with the ladies. Sandro loves fun but he's smart. He won't ruin himself. Masetto's young and you need to watch him. There's no danger. Don't insist, Sandro. Thanks a lot. I'd happily go but tonight's impossible. I must stay with papa. Then have a nice beddy-bye. You're right. Tonight, you must be with your father. He deserves it. Bye. We'll see you tomorrow at the pool. And good job. Here comes Masetto. You see? - He's incorruptible. They wanted me to go with them. - You could've gone. Masetto, allow me to say… - Masetto! Pistoletta. See, I saw you. Bravo, Masetto. - Did you like it? Damn, what a reverse punch! What did you do to your eye? You going to the gym tomorrow? - Yes. Can you teach me that punch? - I get it. I'll teach it to you, but now go to bed. Masetto, allow me say… - Good evening, Cavaliere. See you tomorrow at the shop. Let me tell you, if Rocchetti didn't go down… - He'd be up. If there was another round, it'd be iffy. Tonelli was losing his wind but… Please, Tonelli has wind and hits hard. He has to, he's only a beginner, let me tell you! Masetto will lose as true as my name's Sardella. Wanna bet? A bet? - With Sardella? With Sardella. Wanna bet? Did it go well? - And how. Knockout in the 7th round. Imagine Romoletto. - He's on cloud 9. How is it going? - Not bad. Look, Sardella took two tamarinds and hasn't paid. Mark it down. - Mark it? Where? Rocchetti and Radesio? Masetto could eat them both. Poor fool, I see you don't know Radesio. He'll knock him down in the 3rd round. Wanna bet? "Wanna bet?" - Be patient. Instead of betting, pay the tamarinds. - Mr Luigi… Mr Luigi? Must I buy another ledger just for you? Let me bet, then I'll pay you. - I'm fed up. He said that Masetto will put Radesio on the ground. Imagine with all the class Radesio has. It would take 40 Masettos for 1 Radesio. A tamarind. Leave it, it can make you ill. We'll wind up in the ring. A glass of water. Cavaliere. - Gigetto! Weren't you at the match? Of course. Did you see it? - And heard it. What a punch! It was a technical and plastic punch. First class. Romoletto knows his stuff. Mrs Giulia, my respects. You're pleased tonight, eh? Yes, but I can't take it anymore. - Yet you love Masetto? Yes, but whenever there's something of this kind: If Lazio loses or Rome wins or a cyclist falls, it's non-stop babble. Wanna bet? - Hear that? Insane, these "phonetics!" It's Masetto Tonelli, the one who beat Rocchetti. What a punch! - Bravo, Masetto! You go, champ! Are you happy, Papa? It didn't go badly, eh? Anna? She's still awake. - Maybe, she's not sleepy. Easy, Papa. You'll wake up mama. You really think she's asleep? Going to the pool tomorrow? - Yes. I'll come get you. Go to sleep. - Good night, Papa. Romolo! - What's the matter? I woke you up, eh? - And Masetto? They smashed his head in. Romolo! Sorry, but I always came back with my head on my neck… and yet I took my lickings. Masetto is still a boy. Masetto is smarter than me. Don't you doubt it. And… how did it go? - How should it have gone? He won. He knocked him out! You can see he's a good boy. Instead of coming with us… - He preferred to stay with papa. You wouldn't understand. You're a cynic. Yes, I'm a cynic. But you would've preferred it if Masetto was here with us. Besides, he's a fine boy: healthy, strong… And if you succeed, you will be the first. Interesting, isn't it? Damn it! You scared me. You looked like a ghost. What is it? Is he sick? Sick? My foot! Passing by, I saw the light on and went in to turn it off. I know what my monthly bills are. Let's go or we'll wake the boy. It was a good match, you know? We must be happy. He looked like a lion! "Esportazione." One "Popolare." A packet of "Macedonia." Three 25 lire stamps. Good morning, Romolo. - Colonel. "Virginia." I'll pay you tomorrow. I've no change. Of course, Colonel. Anna? Anna? Mr Romolo, give me a packet of salt. Did it go well? - And how! That pleases you, eh? - I heard it on the radio. At the end, everyone was yelling, "Long live Masetto!" You went to bed late last night, eh? You turned off the light when we got back. Tell the truth. Romolo, did you read it? What an article! Three granite columns! They didn't forget to mention your name. Mine was in the past. It's a world for the young! Those of today, a different race. Perhaps because today they're all strong, all athletes. In my day, a boxer, there were some people, who when he passed by, you could hear them saying, "That's a boxer!" As if to say, "There's a showoff". - And what about me? Whenever I did a bicycle "composition," every time I came back, the doorman would say, "Didn't you break your head yet?" Never mind. Gimme a cigar. Blonde! Good day, Mr Romolo. - Bye, Anna. Who's that? - From Milan. She too? - Milan and nothing else! And nothing else. Cute. She's not for us, Cavaliere. - Ah, who knows? She's in love with a boxer! - Masetto? You got it. - And him? He likes her because she's a fine girl but he likes her like a friend. Yes, youth. They don't know how to value certain merit. When you're a certain age, you get a real "cents" of things… And must settle for a good cigar. Right. It's strange. But it's true. Huh? Finally. You slept well this morning, eh? I tidied up the house. If I don't do it… A good housewife has her "abscessions." I have my Masetto. And if he didn't have me… - Romolo! Romolo… - Don't start crying, eh? What can you do? Oh, well, that's the way it is. Masetto needs me. Surely, his mother too. - Not at all. Without me, my boy would be finished. But not because I teach him to box. No. Because only he understands me. Come, Cavaliere. It's late and he's waiting for me at the pool. We'll back at half past, eh? Don't forget Masetto' steak! Sorry if, Romolo, I allow myself to point out that you're too cold with your wife. Indeed, I'd say glacial. Me? Not in your dreams. Why? Why? The mother has her filial rights. It's not about that. Women don't understand one iota! See ya, Cavaliere. We'll meet at the cafe for scopa. I'll give you a rematch. - Bye, Romolo. Just look at him. You're obsessed with your boxer. Look, he's climbing to the diving board. Just look at him. Nice dive. He has style. He's perfect. Besides, what I find interesting about that boy… You find him interesting? He seems stupid to me. No, he's very interesting. Renata! Oh, it's Giorgio. - Coming to the bar? I'm going. I had begged Giorgio… I get it: Giorgio will help you. - He's a true friend. Coming? No. Bye. I leave the student in your care. Have no doubts about it. No, no, listen, I can't take it anymore. She's been calling me since 7 am. Is it my fault if you're an homme fatal? - Oh, cut it out! Besides, what would it cost you? And she's a lovely gal. They're all lovely to you. - No, no, Renata is beautiful. Eh? Isn't that right? What? - Is it true you're beautiful? God, I'm no monster! - Masetto is a handsome lad… Let's go to the bar. Wanna buy me a drink? - With pleasure. Your dad won't be expecting you now. Masetto! Papa. Good morning, Mr Romolo! Will you excuse me? I'll be right back. - Of course. It's bad luck. - You hafta be patient. Shall we go to the bar? - No. Let's wait for Masetto. After the swim, one starts to get hungry. Did you exercise? Swim? - Yes. Very good. Go get dressed. But first, I must offer that lady a drink. You mustn't drink. - Don't worry. Want to come? No, go. I'll wait for you here. It went well. Papa gave him permission. And how he runs! A good sign. Excuse me. - Your papa loves you very much. I love him too. Giorgio, learn. What do I have to learn? You treat me like I was some thug! I have only one flaw: I'm too loving. - To everybody. Yeah, even you, who doesn't deserve it. Hey, Radesio, look who's here. Masetto! If he sees you, he'll run away. Wanna bet? Masetto with a woman. Strange. Go on, make fun of him. Can't you see what airs he gives? An "American". And you? Lemon juice. - Learn! That's right, I'm the immoral one. - A beer and three sandwiches. Champion, don't you drink? You talking to me? - Yeah, you're the man of the hour. I confess I'm so scared of fighting you… I'm almost thinking of declaring a forfeit. Do it. You'll save me some work. Are you offended? - Me? I should thank you. Maybe not so much in a few days. - He'll run now. Wanna bet? We don't thank each other in our sport. Are you nervous, Radesio? Boy, some rhubarb for the gentleman. Thanks, champion. I'll gladly take it. You're paying, right? - Of course! You don't drink? - I'm not thirsty. I thought your papa came to give you the bottle. The bottle! Careful, because soon, you'll need to get a bottle. Why is that? Someone could knock out your last four teeth. Hi, Radesio. - Goodbye, Busatti. It's late. We have to go. Farewell, champion! Thanks for the good wishes. I'll do my best. How much? - Never mind. I'll take care of it. Excuse me. - Come on, papa's waiting. All we needed was Radesio! - You got bad luck with that boy. All you do is eat! You make me so angry…! Masetto! Oh, Masetto. It's one o'clock. Aren't you hungry today? What's the matter? - I saw Radesio. Where? - There, in the bar. He wanted to play the wiseguy. What did he say? That he would forfeit. Why? - He was joking, Papa. Ah, joking? He was trying to intimidate you, I'm telling you. And we… shall knock him out! What a whopper! Did I hurt you? - No, come on. To the left. Left. One, two! C'mon! Go! Come on! Go on! One, two. One, two. Go. Go! C'mon! To the left. Power! Come on! You must be aggressive. It's all good, eh? Hi, Masetto! - Sandro. How are you? - Fine. Papa? - He went to peek at the audience. He's a bit nervous. - And you? I'm very calm. - Careful, Radesio's a bad guy. No… - He's capable of sneaky moves. I'll keep an eye out. - What's new, Sandro? Nothing, Mr Romolo. - He was saying that Radesio is in great shape. - And aren't you too? See, he'll try to intimidate him. That's his system. But we'll stay calm and collected. That's how we'll beat him. Got it? You gotta knock him down in the 3rd round. You're strong but he's young and has more wind. Don't worry. I know what to do. Serafino had a tin whistle he played so well. That when it was cloudy he made the sky clear. Serafino, what are you doing? "I don't know, so I whistle." Serafino, what are you doing? I'll play the whistle too. Ready! The gentleman is served! Giaccone must've had the worst of it. Tonelli! - Here I am! I thought it was my turn. Mr Romolo, tonight the champion must be left to his friends. To the champion of Italy, I will give permission. Come on, Radesio! Come on, Radesio! Masetto, I'm here! Knock off those bravos! You don't know a damn about boxing. He'll go down in the 3rd round. Wanna bet? - Stop that betting! Mr Luigi, I didn't order anything! Yes, but you're bad luck. Look, if Radesio loses, I'll cancel all your tamarinds and I'll buy you one tonight! Then I'm afraid, I won't drink. Radesio, light middleweight Italian champion… versus Masetto Tonelli, challenger to the title. A bout in 12 rounds. Radesio attacks Tonelli likes lightning! There! A direct hit thrice to Masetto's chin! He appears surprised. He reacts. Radesio repeats it. Why is Masetto so often taken off guard? Look! Renata's already in her place. She's really got it bad. - Tonight, we'll have fun. A rich banquet has been prepared for the champion. Strange. Renata is a refined gal. She let herself be won over by the fist. - I don't get it. Is it already over? - No, it's just the 1st round. There are 12 of them. - Ah, a long story! I don't understand a thing about boxing. - I'll explain it. Keep calm, eh? And watch out for your stomach. Don't give him any quarter. Attack. Sorry, dear, how am I to blame? Keep your hands up, eh? And move your legs. Agility! - Remember: in the 3rd round. He's out of breath. See how aggressive Radesio is? He wants revenge. Eh? What did I tell you? In the 3rd round! Wanna bet or not? Step back! Step back! Papa? - What is it? You could've already beaten him. Don't spare him. Mr Luigi! Goodbye tamarind! May you die of thirst! Jinx! I'm afraid Renata will hafta take him to the hospital. Poor boy, I feel sorry for him. Is that the father? - Yes. A fine rascal! He should've known his son couldn't take him on. He's the weaker. Even I could see that right away. I thought him something else. After what you told me. Now, you're taking it out on me? Hit hard, Radesio, so we can put an end to this suffering! When are you going to stop being a jerk? Don't get angry, Cavaliere. It's not your fault he hits hard. If Radesio hits hard, I'll drop… drop… I'll drop… My foot! Radesio is still the tiger of the first rounds. Masetto thinks about reacting, but gets a hit to the liver. One, two… Again to the body. He raises his arms. What are you doing? To the listeners, excuse me. The fight gets to us too. In the ring, a man attacks ferocious… He caught Masetto full on. A hit to the eye. It's bleeding. Miss Anna! Miss Anna! Ma'am? Did you hear it? I'm sorry. Turn on the radio. I want to hear! Please, my Masetto… Hurry, for heaven's sake! Masetto? What are you doing? It should've been over by now. This is the last time I say it. You're an idiot. You're starting to lose your wind. I'm leaving. - It's better to go to the movies to watch boxing. At least one knows the winner. - They know it here too. Poor Masetto. - Poor Romoletto! It's over. - C'mon, Radesio, you got this! The first tamarind he gets, put inside a little… I'd like to jump into the ring to finish it. Can't you see he's winded? What? You scared? What a sad sight. - The banquet will fall through. A shame. I could slap that thug of a father! Keep hitting with the left and finish it with the right! This is shameful! I don't know you anymore! Come on, Masetto! Obviously, his eye wasn't hurt much! Masetto is winning. Masetto! Masetto! 1, 2, 3, 4… 5, 6, 7, 8, 9… Step back! Don't divide them, referee! 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9… Hey, Sardella! Come and get that tamarind! Masetto Tonelli knocks Radesio out in the 8th round! Masetto! Masetto! Do you hear? They all love my Masetto. Yes. Come out, Masetto! - Thanks, boys but now go! Is he hurt? - Masetto? Don't make me laugh. Now scram! We want the champion! We want Masetto! Masetto? Damn it! It's all my fault. Masetto! Papa? I won? - Yes… Yes, you won. We won. - What did I do? I could only say harsh words. But it wasn't what I thought. I just didn't want you to lose. My eye hurts. It burns. - A trifle. Is the doctor coming? - Let's not be a sissy, eh? He'll come. He should already be here. What is he waiting for? There he is! Are you alone? - Yes, I am. Is he hurt? - His eye burns a little. Is he coming or not? - He's with Radesio, May I come in? How is he? - His eye, Doctor. Let's see. Nothing serious. We just need to put a few clips. - Alright then. Come, buck up! - No, he better go to the hospital. Meanwhile, let's stop the bleeding. I'm going. A group is waiting for me. Not a word about the hospital, eh? The public must never know. Don't worry. I'll find an excuse. Masetto has fought his match and I'm fighting my appetite. Hungry? - I can't stand it, Let's hope there's just not flowers and the smell of perfume. Don't worry, you'll be well fed. While you're busy with Masetto, we'll be busy with something else. Is there chicken? Let's have a nibble. There's Sandro! Alone? Masetto can't come. - What? He apologizes but he had no choice. He must leave. The administration… you know one can't rest in certain cases. Then let's go to sleep. Sleep, my foot! Let's go eat. I'm hungry. Masetto, wait for us here a moment. We'll take a taxi. Radesio? We didn't even shake hands. Right. We don't have to be enemies. In the ring, it's something else but right here, just us two, it isn't nice. Sure, it's the people who make us fight with all their talk. Come on, Masetto! The car's outside! The doctor is waiting. Goodbye, Radesio. Bye, Masetto. Masetto! Masetto! The Italian middleweight champion has resumed training Masetto Tonelli does not rest on his laurels. He has resumed training for the European Champion fight. Do you always go so fast when you're strolling? I'm not strolling. I'm training. - I know. Eva Reni, a friend of Sandro's. Ah, Sandro. - He was one who told me, "Masetto trains every morning at the Mussolini Forum" and here I am. Isn't Renata coming to keep you company? Do you see her often? The day before yesterday we were in Ostia with Sandro and Giorgio. Ever… by yourselves? No. Why? I just thought so. She invited me one night to her home but I didn't go. Ah! You're discourteous. When I train, I don't even go out with friends. Bravo. I saw you in the ring in your last match with Radesio. Well done, Masetto. - It was a tough match. Yes. I felt for you that night, but you had a terrific recovery. One can see that you have willpower. Do you like boxing? - Yes. Can you teach me? You? Why not? I'm very strong, you know. Feel this. If you laugh, you'll kill me. Have you finished training? Yes, my secretaries are waiting. - Where? Behind the hedge. They guard my wardrobe. Come, get dressed. I'll drive you home. But… - Don't you want to? Yes thanks. - Climb up! Goodbye, guys. See you in the morning. Who is that? A woman. With an automobile. Hey! Throw in the pasta! It's noon and Masetto's hungry and won't want to wait! How's our champion doing? He's resting? It's only right. Resting? At 7, jogging, at 8, punching bag, at 9, gymnastics, at 10, massages, and then… He'll end up getting sick, that poor boy. I told you to throw in the pasta! She's always poking her nose in things that don't concern her. Maternal "psychosis." Nobody knows what it's like to earn a title. - Who? Like when they made me cavaliere? - Don't joke! Masetto must carry his name abroad. He's now Italy's champion. He must become Europe's champion. The life of the boxer is short. You must take advantage of the right moment. - Right. Then we agree: Tomorrow come pick me up at 9, we'll go to Masetto's and then to the castle. Will the prince be there too? - Of course! I organized the whole thing. The prince is delighted. Hey, but… there will be food, right? A fine lunch? In a princely style? Tomorrow at 9. On the dot. Fifi! Come here! Did anyone call? - No, Ma'am. You may go then. Ah! Only from De Gasperi. He said, Ma'am, the two dresses will be ready on Thursday. Mr Cagli called and said that it'll be difficult to set the ruby ​​on that ring. The hairdresser can't come before 4. Miss Geri want to know if you'll play bridge at her house. Mrs Mary expects you at poker. My friends have such bad vices. No, no playing today! Milan called but I answered that you weren't at home. Fine, fine. Do you want a cocktail? - I don't know. I don't drink. I'll prepare it myself. A weak one. I'm quite the expert, you know? Won't you stay for breakfast? I can't, they're waiting at home. Romolo! The soup is ready. Alright! We must wait for Masetto. Enjoy your lunch, Ma'am. - Thank you, Cavaliere. To your next match. Excuse me. Hello? Ah, it's you. How are you? From the prince? Well done! You have imagination. I want to see if I can win over my athlete… "amidst the succulents and weeping willows." Surely, the place is appealing. Do I know the castle? No, but you describe it so well it's like I can see it. You're laughing? You're right! What do you expect? I can't sleep at nights! It's ridiculous but that's the way it is. It's a fancy. You wouldn't understand. No, I understand you perfectly. These things do happen. Just like that. When one least expects it. You come too, you'll have fun. The prince is very nice. Sandro and Giorgio will be there too. To be sure, I will. Thank you. See you tomorrow. Renata. What did she want? Tomorrow she'll come with Giorgio to take you to Prince Righi's castle. You'll spend a lovely day. - But I don't want to go. I'll come too. Please, Antonio, for today, we must forget our years. Excellency, I will do my best. These kids mustn't notice that we're old. I'm counting on you. So then… on your toes! Sandro! Hey! Giorgio! Hey! When do we eat? Masetto! WHEN THIS BELL RINGS, LUNCH IS ON THE TABLE Here, in the sun. Masetto. What's the matter with you? - Me? Nothing. Masetto… Giorgio! Over here, Giorgio! Renata's here… and she wants to talk with you. What's the matter, Renatina? Giorgio, will you do me a favor? - Yes. Go away! - I'm going. Stay! - I'm staying.. What can you do? Be patient. He doesn't understand. He has muscles but his brain… No, I don't get it: I have met many girls without muscles and had a great time. A little lady like you… You must have imagination to appreciate beauty. I like everything that's beautiful and… and everything that's good. WHEN THIS BELL RINGS, LUNCH IS ON THE TABLE But I have patience. And I'm sure that my time will come. In the countryside, under the golden sun, so many couples talk about love. Of love! And with kisses, the gentle harmony spreads out in the beautiful sky of April. Kisses! Like swallows chasing each other, couples sing while new loves bloom, buds on each others hearts. In the countryside, under the blue sky, how sweet it is to say face to face, "I love you, and more and more!" The brook, like a serpent of gold, sparkles rushing towards the sea. His old song from the heart is an invitation to dream. Towards the dream floats the boat of love. When the bell rings, lunch is on the table. Where is he? - Who? Masetto. Who knows? Let's think about eating. Masetto! Eva! Masetto! Eva! Well done! Giorgio? - Eh? Let's go. - Where to? Go! - Now? Impossible. Giorgio, try to avoid a scandal. Come, hurry. This is barbaric! - Come on! Years pass by but it's always the same story. Kids, enjoy your meal! - Thank you! Romolo! The soup is ready! Today we're alone. Masetto isn't here. He went on a trip. I don't know where. With Sandro. Yes, with Sandro. What's going through your head? Me? Nothing. Besides, I'd be happy if Masetto began to think about… Because I've a little project. When I get something into my head… I wanted him to become champion of Italy. He is. The champion of Europe… he will be. And afterwards… That would please you very much, wouldn't it? Romolo, the soup's getting cold! Let it get cold! Do you know what's a man's biggest trouble is? A wife. Enjoy your meal. - Thanks. What? Aren't you eating? I was talking to Anna. - Ah, Anna was there? What a good girl she is and then she's so pretty. If I were single, I'd marry her. - Poor thing! What "poor thing?" I'm not a lowlife, am I? This soup is good. - Thank goodness. How strange. It's the first time we've eaten without Masetto. No, the second time. When the sports club invited you, you didn't go. Yeah, I didn't go. 3 years ago. Damn, what a memory you have! Always with you, only with you, I want to spend my life. To rejoice with you, to suffer with you, in the sweet dream that beckons. I am the great love you have dreamed of. I am the woman that you were waiting for. Always with you, only for you, are my love kisses. Tell me too that more and more… - Ma'am? Ma'am! - What is it? Milan is on the phone. What did you say? - I had to say you were home. Excuse me for a moment. …clasped in mine. How many beautiful dreams and how many fantasies. How many beautiful hopes arise in my heart. Why not? Why not? He asked me a 1000 questions. I didn't know what to say. I said you haven't been out for 2 days and you're not very well. Hello? Yes, asleep. Oh, nothing serious. You're leaving? For London? What? Happy? No, I'm happy you're going to make some good deals. Yes, I love you. Always with you, only for you are my love kisses. My aunt. She could go on for hours. She's alone in Milan and having nothing to do, she calls me all the time. Sorry, Masetto. Just this once… we'll forgive her. Go to sleep. What are you doing up? But what could've happened? What do you think happened? We're a fine pair, we are. We still think Masetto's a boy. - But he has never… stayed out all day and night. And now he's beginning to! And he has every right. But he could have let us know. Maybe perhaps, he went with Sandro. It's the first time we had to wait for him. We need to get used to it. But don't think anything bad. Because nothing happened. And when he returns, keep quiet as if it never happened. There he is! I'll throw the key down! Give me the key. Hurry up. Where did you put it? - It was here. Did it disappear? - Here, it is. Go to bed! Masetto, here you go! I made you stay up? - No, I was reading the papers. And mama? - Huh! Sleeping like a log. Were you with Sandro? Yes. Good. You're tired, eh? Go to sleep. Good night, Papa. There! He's in third place! Bravo! He's in second place! Come on, Omero! Take first place! - Take first! Sorry, that horse isn't Omero, it's Brunetto. Which one is Omero? - Number 4, in last place. Why did you tell me that one was Omero? You see, all horses have 4 legs. That one has wooden legs, can't you see? I'll wait for you here. Eva! Roberto! How are you? - Very well. And him? - He's here with me. Then it's serious? - More than I could ever imagine. It's strange: Someone like you Eva, with a boy like that, a boxer. It's not the boxer that counts. It's the boy. That's why I love him. - You're cruel. Come, don't joke. You'll always be a good friend. At least, I hope so. - Always. Masetto, let me introduce Roberto Franchi. Tonelli. Ah, you won? - Yes. Curious. - Yes. You staying in Rome? - No, I'm going to Cortina. Then we'll see you. I'll be there too in the month of December. There'll be some interesting boxing. It'll be a pleasure to see you. - Congratulations, Eva. Miss, what have you done? In 10 lines, there are 4 errors. Here you wrote the same word twice. I don't know what to think of you. You were the best. What's the matter? Nothing. Give it to me and I'll recopy it right away. Please, don't let it happen again or I'll be forced to… I'm sorry. It will never happen again. A left. Come on, a left. A left. 1, 2. A left. A left. 1, 2. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2 here. I went to the cafe and they said you were here and I thought… No, he has other things to do. He doesn't train anymore. Who would've thought it? He stays out all day. We never know anymore what time at night he comes in. I can't sleep. In the morning, he rises late, washes, shaves… And I won't say how he treats that poor woman, his mother. He doesn't think about anything and spends the little he had saved. Bah! How will he end up? We mustn't exaggerate. All this is part of the boy's psychology. He meets a woman older than him and bingo, he pounces. It's the "paraphrase" of life, my dear. Let's go. Come on. 1, 2! 1, 2. 1, 2, 3! A left and turn. Amalia, go and open the shop. I'll stay here. I must talk to him. Anyway, try to be calm. Go on. I know what to do. Shall we go do some fighting this morning? I'm not fighting anymore. You're joking, right? Masetto, look your father in the face. No, I'm not kidding. In fact, I wanted to tell you that I'm leaving tonight and will be gone for a fortnight. Going out with that blonde, eh? With that slut! I pity you because you don't know what you're saying and because you're old. I will never set foot in this house again! What are you doing, Mrs Amalia? I'm getting older. I'm not in my right mind anymore. See? You see that boy in the front row? Which one? That tall one! With dark hair! Several have dark hair. That one… Wait. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6… the 7th! The 7th. The 7th? And? - That's… my son! I am delighted to have had, as chairman of our committee, the task of rewarding the new champions of Italy, winners in today's fine race. And now, another prize. Eva Reni, the lucky star of all athletes. Her smile brings good luck. Ah, that's why we won. - I don't think so. You're so used to moving quickly from one victory to another. Then tomorrow you'll honor us by coming with us to Tre Croci. I'm not as strong as you are. I can't climb mountains. I'm contented to watch them from the hotel window. Bad. Very bad. You must come up on your own legs. And when you get tired, we'll carry you like this. Ah, I had forgotten: Masetto Tonelli. - Tonelli? Ah, the middleweight champion of Italy! When is the European championship? - It hasn't been decided yet. We must honor you. We athletes mustn't waste time. Right! Let's go drink! - A great idea! I like boxing! You'd make a good heavyweight! A little sullen, your Masetto. - Yes, but he's very good. Yes, but people are very bad. You are well known. The rumors are flying and land who knows where. What do you mean? - Well… just saying. Eva, why don't you think more about yourself, about your future? You expose yourself with this boy and that could hurt you a lot. You understand me. If he finds out… Don't say anything, Roberto. Don't remember me. I'm so happy. For the champion! "My dear, it's the first year that I'm away on your name day. In 15 days, I hope to leave London and return to Milan." Eva? Are you ready? I'm coming. I'm ready. What is it? Happy name day, Eva. Thanks, Masetto. Let's go! Mr Romolo… Don't ask me for salt, OK? I know you came to learn something about Masetto. But I know nothing! Nothing! Anna? Don't go. I'm sorry. I'm a beast. Mr Romolo, you're suffering. - Me? No. Ah! Finally. It'd be nice to go up with one's own legs, but how tiring. I can't stand it anymore. Masetto? What's the matter? Are you tired too? Yes, I'm tired of seeing you with all these people. And Roberto seems to do it on purpose! Every day a new introduction. Eva, let's go away. Let's leave here. And this is why I wanted to speak to you. And you must be reasonable. You know, my aunt is sick. Tomorrow, I'm going to Milan. I'll come with you. - I told you that's impossible. You go on to Rome. I won't leave you. Don't take away the joy of spending my days with you. No, I must go alone. Why? For many reasons. I'm very well known in Milan. Even if we acted with the utmost caution, it still would become known that I'm your lover. You're right. - There, you see, you too understand why. Let me speak, please. I know, there's already too much talk about us. Even in my circles. Besides, it's necessary I go back to my work. I can't keep living like this. I love you so much, Eva, and I can no longer stand this life of secrets, of lies. I don't want to hide anymore. So then? So, I've decided to marry you. Right away. Masetto… Hey, kids! Still here? Aren't you hungry? We'll be right down. Masetto, go get changed. Eva, please hurry, eh? This stroll has given me quite an appetite… Don't worry. I'll be very fast. Go on. Talk. I received a letter from Masetto. What does it say? That he's now in Milan and wants to go back to work. He says he has no money… and asks me if I can lend him something. He says he'll come to Rome and says he wants to get a job. Because he wants to marry her. Give me the letter! Let me see. Nothing… Nothing! Not one word. And I don't mean me but for her, his mother. Not one greeting for his mother! Thank you, Sandro. Thank you very much. I'm sorry. I don't know if I did wrong, but I thought… No, on the contrary! You did very well. Bye, Sandro. Good night, Mr Romolo. Enough! Enough! I can't stand it anymore. You understand that I can't? My whole life has gone by like this: I've grown old waiting for you, while you beat yourself for that damn passion! And I here at home, to heal your wounds, to smile, to always say yes! I've said yes my entire life! I was hoping it would end. No, Sir, you took my boy too! Since he was little, always with you. Always with you! And now he wants to marry that tramp and I won't see him again! Not this, eh? Not this! You bring him back to me, understand? You don't believe me, Roberto. - Yes, Eva, I do. Indeed, I'm convinced that you could be… an affectionate wife, a model mother, even happy to lead a modest existence. However, today this is your life. Don't kid yourself. I love him so much. Today, you haven't given up anything yet… but you don't really have means of your own. If you became Mrs Tonelli, the spring would dry up and… - Roberto. Yes, I know. I seem mean but I'm not. Now perhaps, unwittingly, I'm doing that boy good too. He would've been poor too. If we leave tomorrow morning at 9, we'll be in Milan at 8 in the afternoon… at 11:00. Cavaliere, I'm very grateful. To have you make this journey… I'm afraid to go there alone with my temper… Romolo, let me say a few words to that "cortisone." Besides, to be honest, I've heard it a 1000 times, "Milan and nothing else." I'm curious to see this city. I, who have traveled all Central Italy, have never been there. I wrote to Sandro. He'll certainly bring the letter to my father. Just imagine the scene. They think you're a dangerous lady. But when they get to know you… They're such simple people. My dad is a bit rough but he basically does anything I want. Masetto, don't make so many plans. It's impossible for me to marry you. Eva, you're joking. - No, I'm not joking. That would be very nice, but it's impossible. I love you, Masetto. You can't imagine how grateful I am. But now it's too late. I could never get used to a simple and modest life. But I love you. We're from two different classes. Here in Milan, I have a rich person who gives me everything I want. And your Aunt Luisa? - I lied. He'll be here in a few days. It's best you leave. Then I'm going to Rome. And if you like, we can continue like this. My father was right, you're a… - Masetto! I pity you. Hello? What? Have you already returned from London? Yes. I got the telegram. Thank you. Not tonight, please, I beg you. I'm sick. And I have need of rest. No. No, I'm not mean. Yes. Tomorrow. Around 4. Yes. I'll wait for you. Masetto! - Oh, Radesio. Here in Milan? - Yes. I have a match in 2 days, didn't you know? Ah, right, you don't care about sports anymore, eh? In our circles, they're talking a lot about you. You're wrong. Go back to Rome and train. You can have a career, I'm telling you. I'd like to go back but… I wrote to Sandro to send me money. I'll give it to you. Then you can pay me back in Rome. No thanks. - What? Won't we meet again? Maybe not in the ring but at the café… Will 200 be enough? This way you can return tonight? Yes, in the 3rd drawer, at the bottom. It's a heavy black shirt. It's cold in Milan. Here it is. - Thanks. What time is it? 8:30. - It's late, we must hurry. If I may, I'll carry it. I'd like to say hi to Mr Romolo. And ask him to be calm with Masetto. Masetto? You here? I just arrived from Milan. And now, what will we do? I packed my suitcase, bought a 2nd class round-trip ticket. Did Sandro talk to papa? That's why we're going to Milan. Your father wanted to have a few words with that um… No, Cavaliere, it's all over. No need to talk about her. Then we say no more. But I'm still going to Milan. 2nd class, round trip! These cigars seem a bit bad. - Yeah… Romolo! Everything ended well. Masetto had a fight. He's here! But I'm still leaving. I'll send a card from Milan and "its surrenderings." I'll take a trip around the Duomo and then re-enter the country. Have a good trip! He's back: the "protocol" son. Go, this is the right moment. Don't waste time! Have a good trip! If not, I'll miss my train. Masetto… Go on. Papa is waiting for you. Put them in bag, else they'll go bad. Put them in bag, else they'll go bad. Papa, I wanted to tell you… What? That tomorrow, we'll start fighting again. English subtitles by sineintegral@KG
