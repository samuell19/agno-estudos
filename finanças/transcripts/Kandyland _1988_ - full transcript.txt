I just screwed up my first bikini contest, that's all. - That's too bad, but you're sitting in my chair. - I'm sorry, I didn't even realize. - No, no, no. I can put on makeup standing in a men's room surrounded by six sailors and two rumba bulls. And believe me, I have. (Joni laughs) How'd you like it up there? - Oh, it was definitely fun. I just wish I could have made it to the end. - First time's always the toughest. That's when you get the bug. - What bug? - Being on stage, getting all that attention. Ever think of dancing? - Who, me? You've got to be kidding. - You've got the looks, that's all. Anyway, that's what I do. I just enter these contests to pick up a few extra bucks. - What kind of dancing do you do? - Exotic dancing. You know, strip tease, jazz, new wave, the works. - Doesn't it ever get to you? All those men always hooting and whistling? - Only when I'm sleeping. (Joni laughs) - Are the girls from the bikini contest in here? - Yeah. - You think I can get in there? - No. - I can't get in there? - No. - I gotta get in there. - Hey, no, I said no. - Come on, man. - No, I said. Come on, no! - All right, okay. Okay, all right? Good. - Hey, come on, hey! - [Frank] There you are. - Hi, Frank, you just missed my stage debut. - Yeah, what the hell's this contest? What got into you? - I don't know, it just sort of happened. Plus, it was a good way to kill time till you showed up, right? (lips smacking) - You're too much, you really are. (lips smacking) (sighs) Come on, you got your stuff? - Right here. - Vinny and Lumpy are waiting for for us in the truck. - By the way, where do you work? - Club on Sixth, just off of Main. It's called Kandyland. - See you later, woo! - Hi everybody, that was a close one. Yes, that really, yeah. We have a winner, and the winner is, yeah, yeah, I know. Miss Powell!

Ow! - [Speaker] I mean, I shouldn't have asked you anyway. (people on television chattering) (audience laughing) (people on television chattering) (hammer banging) - Hey, Joni, what's all that banging? - What banging? - [Speaker] I don't even know what you're expressing. I mean, I'm not even sure what it is. (audience laughing) (TV characters chattering) - What is going on in here? - I still can't find my other sock. - Yeah? Well, don't worry about it because you're gonna find it later. - Later, later, everything is later. (vibrant pop music) - [Frank] What do you want on your sandwich? - Any tuna left? - No, but we got some bologna. I think we got some bologna. Joni.

(machine buzzes) - [Mrs. Pruitt] You must be seeing things, Mister. You ought to have your eyes examined. - [Customer] Oh really? Well, what do you call this stain, huh? - [Mrs. Pruitt] That's not a stain, it's a burn! - Well, I don't care what you call it. Look, you did it. Now I want it fixed or replaced. - Mister, if it was our fault, we'd be more than happy. Where the hell do you think you're going? - I'm going to lunch, Mrs. Pruitt. It's 1230. - Not right now, you're not. Get back behind that machine and work on this jacket. So I can get rid of this asshole. - I beg your pardon? - And be quick about it. We've got a big load of diapers coming in tonight, and I need you to work late. I want you here extra early tomorrow morning for those bedsheets from the hospital. - Yes, ma'am. Oh, Mrs. Pruitt? - Yeah. - Do you think you can give me a ride home? My boyfriend's out with the truck tonight. - (laughs) Don't be silly. There's a bus stop just around the corner. I'm late for my beauty shop appointment. (car door bangs) (car engine revs) - Save your money, Mrs. Pruitt! It's a lost cause! (phone rings) Come on, Frank. Pick up the phone.

And believe me, Kandyland is no exception. I'm always asked one question more than anything else. People always say, Mad Dog, how do birds make love? And what I do is I illustrate it for them. I say, "Hey, look. "I got a picture here of a male and a female quail. "And this is a way that birds make love." (book slams) (audience laughs) All this talk about the economy, it's got so low. - Rum and Coke. - Thank you. - This makes a great octopus jock. Well, I think it's time to bring on the star of our show, huh, huh? - Yeah! - Okay, huh? - Yeah! - Huh? - Yeah! - Oh, huh? Okay! Well, just three months ago, she was passing through town. She's made Kandyland her home. And by gosh, we're all lucky for that. Let's have a nice round of applause for Miss Harlow Divine! (audience cheers) Shh! (eerie music) (dreamy harp music) (energetic pop rock music) (energetic pop rock music continues) (sultry moaning) (energetic pop rock music continues) - Frank? - Hmm. - Do you think that we'll ever get married? - Sure we will. Soon as we're ready. - I think I'm ready. I wanna be your wife. - You wanna be my wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa. - Come on. - Wa, wa, wa! - Be serious. - Wife. - Very good. - Oh, let's not rush things, okay? We're young yet. We still got plenty of time. (lips smacking) Just relax. - You scared? - Don't be ridiculous. What's there to be scared about, Joni? Me, scared? - Are you? - Yeah, a little. - I guess I am too, a little. (gentle music) But a ring would be nice. - Mm-hmm. (gentle music continues) (phone rings) (phone rings) - You're late, Joni, I won't stand for it. - I'm sorry, Mrs. Pruitt. It won't happen again. - Fine, but I'm docking you an hour's wages. - But I'm only 10 minutes late. - That's 10 minutes too many. Now get behind that sewing machine! The work's piling up! (vibrant pop rock music) Look alive, look alive! I don't pay you so you can crew around back here, move it! Move it, move it, move it! - Excuse me, Mrs. Pruitt. - What do you want? - I don't like the way that you talk to me. - Oh, that's too bad. Now get back to work or you're out of a job. - I don't think you understand. - We'll discuss this on your time, Joni. Not mine. - This is my time, Mrs. Pruitt. I quit. - Quit, you can't quit. You've got work to do! You'll be sorry for this! This was the best job you ever had! You're going no where, lady, you hear me? No where! (hand knocking) - Oh, hey babe? What's up? - Hi, I'm looking for a friend of mine. - I can be that. - No, it's a she. She's a dancer, her name is Harlow. (shoes clacking) (gentle music) I really appreciate you letting me come in. - You gotta understand, anytime before noon is like the middle of the night for me. So what's on your mind? - Well, I want to take you up on your offer. - What offer was that? - About dancing, exotic dancing? - Oh boy, listen. I said you had the looks, that's all. This isn't something you just stand up and you do. It's an art. It takes commitment. - Well, I'll work with you anytime that you want. - Why me? - Because I saw your act, and you really, you're the best. - Want a cup of coffee? - Thank you, yes. - No way, Joni. Forget it! - It's not what you think, Frank. You're not even listening to me. - You wanna dance in a topless bar, I heard enough. - Have you ever been to Kandyland? - No, but I've been to millions just like it. Millions just like it. - You never told me that. - Well, just once. Oh, okay, maybe twice, Vinny took me. Look, horny guys go there. They pay money at these bars to see some skin, and then they go home at night. - This place is not sleazy at all, you've got it all wrong. The show is beautiful and the dancing is incredible. - You call that dancing? - [Joni] You betcha. - Like a night at the ballet, right? Give me a break! - Come on now, you're not being fair. (soft rock music) - Ever since you met that woman, Harlow, I don't know. It's like you're different. - In what way? - You've changed, look at you. Your makeup, your clothes, your everything. - I made this dress myself. Don't you think it's pretty? - Yeah, sure it is. What there is of it. Look, what do you wanna go turn your life upside down for? - I don't. I wanna turn it right side up, and this could be it for me. - Okay, all right then. Go ahead, give it a shot. - Thanks, Frankie. I swear I'll make you so proud of me. (lips smacking) - Yeah, sure. I can't wait. (lips smacking) I don't like this, Joni. - Hey, Frank! - Yeah. - Check that blue station wagon out front when you're done. - What's the problem? - Sounds like the gears are grinding. - And bumpy too. Boom, ba, ba, ba, boom! Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba. (objects crash) What's the matter, Frank? Losing your sense of humor? - Yeah, maybe I am. Maybe I am. - Check these out. None of the other girls are doing it. (Joni laughs) - I don't think I can get into these, let alone get out. - I'll show you when the time comes. - This is real pretty. - That old thing. - I could do a lot with it, fix it up. - Try it on, maybe it'll bring you luck. I wore it the first time I danced. - Thanks. (laughs) Where'd these come from? - New York City. I went there to study ballet. I used to have this dream back then. I wanted to be a ballerina. I wanted to dance Swan Lake. I lived and breathed to play Queen of the Swans. Silly, no? - [Joni] Did you ever get to do it? - No. Instead, I met an agent, said he'd make me a star. He did all right. Before I knew it, I traded Lincoln Center for top billing at the Joker Club. Hell, it's an honest living. - Any regrets? - Not a one. - You know what, that looks really good. - Yeah? - Yeah. ♪ Is you ♪ Ask me to dance and I will take a chance ♪ ♪ Sweep me off my feet - You're ready, Joni.

(cassettes clank) - What are you doing? - I'm through wasting my time. - No, wait! I'm ready. (soft piano music) (tires rumbling) (tires screeching) - [Frank] Joni! Joni, Joni, you home? - I'm back here, Frank! How'd it go in the trial runs today? - Real good. Next stop's the regionals in Parkerville. - That's great! Aren't you happy?

You used to blow your nose without a handkerchief. - Yeah, yeah, that was me. See that, huh? Some things do change. In fact, I'm working for my dad right now making good money. Maybe I could buy you a drink. - Oh, no thanks. I'm already meeting someone here, somewhere. - Yeah? I was thinking after the show, maybe you and me could get together and do a little partying? I could make it worth your while, if you know what I mean. - Listen, Benlap, Belnap, whatever your name is. You were a creep then, and you're a creep now. - Joni. - Frank, there you are. - Don't say a word, just follow me. - Now who's this guy, huh? - It's none of your fucking business. - Yeah, listen, buddy.

He's a little drunk and he doesn't notice anything. - I am not drunk! - Call me if you need me. - Thanks, Biff. - So what's it gonna be? - It's the same as before. - I can't, I can't handle this, Joni. I can't. - Cool out, would you? I'm gonna be home in a couple of hours. - Okay. All right. Have it your way then. Here, because you and I, we're through! The house, the truck, it's all yours! Everything! - Well, you can keep the house because I'm not coming back! Not never! - That's fine with me! - Never! - Hey baby, how's $500 sound? - Oh, go to hell! (Belnap laughs) - Oh man!

What can I do? - Absolutely nothing, it's all under control. How was the couch? - I survived. - Good. You can stay as long as you need to. I mean, if you'd like. - Thanks. I just hope that I'm not making a big, major mistake. - There are no mistakes, only lessons. - That's a good way to look at it. - The only way. (soft classical music) How do you like your eggs? - Scrambled. - I like mine like that too! (Joni laughs) - Harlow, have you ever been in love? - Yeah, I was in love once. To a guy named Stan, a saxophone player. I used to go hear him play at this club every night after work. He said he could only hit the high notes looking at me. Anyway, one thing led to another, and we took a place together. He told me to quit dancing and spend more time at home. So I spent more time at home. Then a month later, wouldn't you know it? Boom. I was pregnant. - Oh no. - First he was all thrilled about it. Talked about moving to the country, raising a family an a farm, the whole bit. (classical music continues) Only pretty soon he was coming home later and later. Until one night, he just didn't come home. I went down to the club to try to find him. They told me he left town. Ran off with his childhood sweetheart. A nurse from New Jersey. Two weeks later, I miscarried. (somber classical music) - Did you ever see him again? - Oh, sure. Couple months later, he was back, begging me to forget he ever left. I kissed him off and never looked back. Chalk it up as one big mistake. - You mean lesson? Remember, there's no mistakes. - Right. And the lesson is, don't ever fall in love with a saxophone player named Stan. (both laughing) (soft rock music) (thunder cracks) - Joni?

Ain't it the truth? - [Mad Dog] I'm feeling really proud tonight. I guess you guys can tell. - Okay, tell me how this looks. Now be honest, Joni. - Let me see, turn your head. Looks pretty good, I can hardly see it. - Will you do me a favor? Don't tell the other girls about this, please. - So how did you walk into that door anyway? (both laughing) - Right.

That would be a kick. - I don't know, are you serious? - Yes, why not? - What about Eppy? - Maybe he'll give us some time off. - I wouldn't count on it. - Sure he will.

Anything that matter? - Oh, not really. - Having second thoughts, about Frank? - Well, sometimes I think about, you know, the way things used to be. I'll be all right. - Sure you will. Once we hit the road, he'll be the last thing on your mind. - I guess you're right. - You and me, we make a good team. - I know. - Come and get me on the roof when you're done, okay? - I will. - I need some fresh air. (lighter clicks) (tense rock music) - [Row] Whew! - Geez Roy, you scared me. - You should be careful up here. Could be dangerous at night. - What do you want? - I got something for ya.

So are you seeing anybody? - No, are you? - No. Are you happy? - Think so. You happy? - Oh yeah, sure. - Hors d'oeuvres? - It's just, come here. I've been doing a lot of thinking. - What about? - I want you to come back home. What's the matter, say something. - It's just not that easy. - [Frank] Why not? - Because things are different now. - Sure, we've been broken up. - No, that's not what I mean. - You're seeing somebody, aren't you? - No, I said I wasn't. - That's hard to believe. - Okay, I'm screwing every guy in town that I meet. - Quit talking so loud. - What do you think about that? Well, then quit calling me a liar. - All right, you're not a liar. Now why can't you come back home? - Because I've got my own life for me now. And Harlow and I got plans, travel plans. We're going to Vegas. - Oh yeah? So what, are you two a? - Are we two, what? - Just kidding, kidding. (chuckles) - I don't think you're very funny. In fact, you've got a lousy sense of humor. I'm leaving. - What's wrong with my sense of humor, huh? I think it's very funny, I'm a laugh a minute. In fact, I'm a riot! I'm hysterical!

But if you ever decide to come back, I just want you to know that I'll, I'll be there waiting for you. No matter how long it takes, I'll be there. - Is that it? - I wanna marry you, Joni. It's the only thing that I've been able to think about. (gentle music) I want you to be my wife. - Frank. I'm so confused. - I'm not confused. Not one bit. And you can dance all you want, all you want. Just come back to me. (romantic music) (lips smacking) (truck motor hums) (tires screeching) (keys jangling) (lighter clanks) - Joni, don't be a fool. Don't throw your whole life away on a man. - That man said that I could dance and he wants to marry me. And maybe I can have both. - Wake up, will you? Everything in life is a trade-off. If you cannot see that, you're gonna hurt so bad you'll forget what it's like to feel anything. - Well, maybe I have to take that chance. - What about us? I thought we had plans. I thought we were friends. - We are friends. I just can't throw him out of my life. I love him. I just need a little time, that's all. - I don't... I don't wanna be alone again. - You're not alone. - The fighting and the losing. And then the fighting and the losing. And the losing and the fighting. And the losing and...
