My mother was the Williams and my father was the Jones. When I grew up there in the little old Spanish Town it was a whole other world. RADIO: The Supreme Court has ordered that the financially strapped Dial insurance company be wound up. The order was handed down today by High Court judge Mr Justice Pa trick Brooke's following an application by the Financial Services Commission. The FSC took over control of the collapsed insurance company after it was unable to service the claims of its clients in the Cayman Islands following the passage of Hurricane Ivan which devastated this island last year. WATER RUNS - Following Hurricane Ivan... NEWS REPORT CONTINUES PAN SIZZLES GRACE". If you have any make-up on, you can't get through the gate. If you've got your toes showing, you can't get in the gate. If you got the heels showing, you can't get in the gate. So what the fuck was I doing inside? AUDIENCE LAUGHS DOG BARKS GRACE: Anything welded in here, Mas P did it. Mas P had a garden that was, I mean, when I say perfection... MOTHER: Yes. GRACE: Obsessive lines, everything completely... MOTHER: Look how the grass has come up since the rain. GRACE: Oh, what happened? They had a hurricane? Did the hurricane kill it? That's Pam's daughter. Yes, I could see Grace when she look like a mutton; 80 or 90, boy. She's going to be a tyrant. HE LAUGHS And this is my son. She's going to be acting like a 25-year-old. But, Dad, everybody, I noticed, in the Jones family they act younger as they get older. Have you noticed? You know what we said yesterday? We said Miss Dorothy makes the best fish. GRACE: I like the heads so I'm gonna take the heads. You got it. You rule. - GRACE: Mmm-hm. How come you married and Daddy wasn't saved yet? That's what I was talking... Oh, no. - We need to get the history right. Yeah, your dad, he spent four years in America, got saved and the brothers told him that Bishop Walters have a daughter in the house that nobody can go in there and get. GRACE: Oh, Lord have mercy! ALL LAUGH Challenged Dad! MOTHER: He... He made up in his mind he was going to do that! PAULO: The contender. - GRACE: Wow. That's a Jones! That's a Jones! That's a Jones! MOTHER: In those days, 17-year-olds don't get married. FATHER: But she had faith. MOTHER: But I didn't even like the Joneses. I didn't feel like I wanted to be bothered with Mr Pat. GRACE: Right. You know, cos he was so boastful and he thought the Jones family was it. GRACE: Yes. - You know, nobody else was good... GRACE: Good enough. - Yeah. MOTHER: Grand P never thought that any of the women that his boys married to were worthy of his boys. - Right. MOTHER: Not every one! - Yup. MOTHER: He gave a problem to Dora, to Lelieth, to me. Aunt Phillis never married because he ran chased off her husbands, her would-be husband. MOTHER: And he was from another prominent family in Spanish Town they was a good family. FATHER: The problem now was, the Williamses with their record of having this big, big, big family, you know what I mean? Outside children. My father said, ah, you know, he was kinda... CHRIS LAUGHS He was kind of rough. GRACE: Really? - Oh, yeah. GRACE: He talk about the Williamses were known for having illegitimate... MOTHER: They don't fly far from the block. GRACE: They had a lot of illegitimate... MOTHER: Pappy Williams did. - CHRIS: Uncle Luther too. MOTHER: Everybody called him Pappy. - FATHER: He boasted 60 children. GRACE: Right. - CHRIS: Oh, my God! He was like a bunny rabbit. FATHER: No, he was a record breaker in Spanish Town because there's another man... - MOTHER: Morgan. FATHER: Morgan. He had around 30 or 40. MOTHER: The Williams side is very creative but then Mr Pat has always told his children 'A Jones never come second. They always come first.'

So I think we nah do the rafting today, you know. Me think we're just going to the Blue Lagoon. GRACE". My sister's daughter never been to Jamaica so I'm showing her. GRACE: Lot of shit in my head. AUDIENCE CHEERS Too much shit in my head! CHEERS Mm-mm. Behave. Be an example. Shut up! CHANTELLE: It's really hard with my mom because her and I are just now working on the issues that we had because of her past. A lot of the time I've asked her, 'What happened to you?' GRACE: And she won't tell? CHANTELLE: It's not that she won't... It's like... She does not remember most of her childhood. Right. And that's why she said, 'I'm so happy you're going to Jamaica with the family so that you actually get the history because I don't remember.' 'I've blocked out most of my memories.' And the only way to get the history of what happened with Pam because she was alone when... because Noel and Chris and Max and me we were all together. So it's true, we shared... You know, I would be in the room watching them. You know, the welts on their backs and I was like the lookout person for them so they could go off before anyone comes back from church. I'd be up climbing the tree and doing the... They'd teach me how to do the boy's whistle. Like this, really loud, you know so they'd know they have to leave from where they are, watching TV. Hm-hmm. - We weren't allowed, forget it. This wine is really good. We weren't supposed to watch TV, radio, none. All that was like 'forget it.' You get caught doing that, you get, you just get beaten for a week. Mom's mom really tried to protect us. And he would just, just push her aside, you know. She'd go, 'Ahh, you can't, don't beat my, my children's... my daughter's children,' or something she'd say in Jamaican. I just thought he just didn't know. He just was doing it by the Bible. And it was like, you know, 'It's because I love you.' Whip! Whip! Read the Bible, you know? We had to read things from the Bible while we were being beaten. It was just like too much and we just thought Pam was, like, having a real good old time, you know? GRACE: I could never show that I missed my mom or my dad when they moved to America. Couldn't write letters that weren't read before. I think I could've been too hard on Mas P at some point. I don't know. Noel kind of showed me this other side to Mas P that I was thinking, 'Well, maybe he has a point,' because he didn't want any kids because he married my grandmother who was already in menopause. So then when y'all moved down here... GRACE: All of a sudden he inherited five puppies, you know what I mean? Right. Yeah. - GRACE: Like 'here.' That... That would be irritating. SHE LAUGHS GRACE: You know? And so, so Noel kind of goes, 'Well, actually, you know, you should look more at Dad, not Mas P' because he took in, you know, five children when obviously he didn't want kids. I never thought of it like that. Hm-hmm. So I did my acting classes and stuff. That's when I really started dealing with all of that through a one-on-one class and really, oh boy, oh boy, oh! I got so violent. CHANTELLE: I bet. - I scared my teacher. He had to hypnotise me. So he'd say a word that would get me to drop whatever it was I had in my hand about to crash over his head. - CHANTELLE LAUGHS No kidding! Yeah, he hypnotised me without me knowing. He found out that ice cream was something that changes my mood. Like, if you said an oyster now, probably I'd do the same. But it's true, I had so much rage, and I knew, even on my stage act, believe it or not I was playing out Mas P. That's why I'm so scary. Every... The way I would move my head on the stage and when I get like... It's really funny. And my, my coach told me, he said 'Those, what you are doing, you're being him!' That male, dominant scary person that I become... - CHANTELLE: Right. ...is actually I'm playing Mas P. Fucking hell. I became him.

Yeah, so long as they're not saying, 'Burn the witch.' Oh, no, I've been there when they're saying, 'Burn the witch.' MAN: What does it feel like? Intense in that they're there, actually, you know and waiting for... for me to perform the songs that they want to hear. Do you have to live up to their expectations? GRACE: My expectations are much higher than theirs, actually. I don't have a question. I have a request. Do you remember when you hit that person on TV? Oh, Russell. - Russell Harty. I don't mind Russell except for the fact he died, but I didn't kill him. Can you hit me? Cos then, I can tell all my friends, 'Yeah, Grace Jones gave me a slap.' Go on then. Oh, you want a ringside seat? Not a punch. Give me a slap though. - You want a ringside seat? Yeah, go on. - You don't... Not yet. Do you want me to provoke you and then...? You could never provoke me in the way he did because... OK. I'll turn my back to you. I can beg. I can beg like a dog. It doesn't... It doesn't work like that, you know what I mean? MAN: Tell them what happened. So, as a model, I was just also singing so it was Lord Lichfield, photographer, you, the model then, ehh, singer not so important. MAN: In a situation where everybody talks shite. But... but the song, my song was a top ten. I sang in the beginning, then we sat down in the circle and Russell turned his back. There was no discussion. I didn't exist. MAN: And jet-lag kicked in. - No, not just jet-lag. I got pissed off. I was like, 'This is not what we rehearsed, right?' I don't know about lords and shit at that point. All I know, I'm supposed to do this, do that, do that rehearse this, and it's done. So I just say 'We rehearsed this so how come you're not discussing anything with me?' Poke,poke,poke. 'Don't turn your back on me.' Poke,poke,poke. And he just kind of went, 'Well, you just sit there.' He didn't push me. WOMAN: What a jerk. - He didn't push. He just said, you can see it, he goes 'You just sit there and behave yourself.' And the audience was a live audience so I'm thinking... 'Fucking hell.' - MAN CHUCKLES So I went... And then I went... And the audience is laughing and he's looking, going, 'What the fuck's going on?' Why is the audience laughing, you know while he's talking to... to Lord Lichfield, right? MAN: Did they cut this from the TV? - No, they didn't, it was live. - MAN: Really? IN ENGLISH ACCENT: Totally fucking live! Yeah. You had your gloves as well. - 'Don't you turn your back on me!' 'One more time,' I said, 'I'm warning you. I'm warning you.' I always give a warning, you know. I don't strike without a warning, right? Never. I swear to God. Lovers. Husbands. Boyfriends. I give a warning. Mothers. Fathers. - That's very accommodating of you. No, I always give a warning. Then my patience just goes lockdown. Disrespect, disrespect. Fuck you, now I've had it. WOMAN: It's fair, it's fair. - I gave fair... I gave fair warning! If you see it, I said, 'I'm warning you.' And then he totally, you know made all the audience and everyone believe that I was insane that I was stoned. - OK, at what point did the handbag... Then I just... I lost it. And I started fucking hitting him. GRACE: Mmm, you should come with us. We want to go to Kyoto or... WOMAN: Kyoto? - GRACE: Come with us. WOMAN: When, when? Me, I got to do DJ tomorrow, so... Tomorrow? Day after tomorrow. Day after tomorrow. Yeah. - Friday. Come on, you're a DJ, you don't need sleep. Come on. You don't need sleep day after tomorrow. That's right, yeah. Yeah, no sleep. No sleep. GRACE: We come where you DJ tomorrow. I'll keep you up. I'm a gypsy. Please. I really... When things get too complicated, I like to break them down back into simplicity and what really counts. And what really counts is when I die, I wanna die happy. SHE LAUGHS DRIVER: Make sure you drink a bottle of Cristal and smoke a big joint just before you die then. - GRACE: I'm not sure about the joint. I might do acid or ecstasy, holding somebody's hand. SHE LAUGHS Even if it's a hand of a ghost that I love. Timothy Leary can come and hold my hand when I'm dying.

Chris and Grace always on the same side. Max and I on the same side. Pam was always neutral. She was always neutral. Never would get involved. But now Grace was having a love affair with Robert Ferguson. THEY LAUGH And Grace... And Grace is eight years old. THEY LAUGH But both of them got stuck in a barrel. CHRIS: Oh, Lord. - In... - MOTHER: Oh, my God. In... in a barrel. And they couldn't come out. PAULO: Oh, no. - Yes! We had a trial for two weeks. CHRIS: Oh, dear. - It was a Michael Jackson trial. CHRIS: Scandal. It was a scandal. - CHRIS: Yeah. Mas P called us to trial. All of us. Nine, eight and seven. Whatever they were doing in the barrel, it couldn't be much. THEY LAUGH We were all little kids. - CHRIS: Yeah. And they call and had a counsel. CHRIS: A meeting. - The counsel convened. And they asked questions for two weeks. Before the beatings came. CHRIS: Oh, dear. Oh, the beatings. Did your mother ever spank you? PAULO: Mom? No, she just hit me really hard. Not ever. And the reason she didn't spank you is because she got all your spankings. CHRIS LAUGHS All at once. I'm telling ya. Mas P used to say... It was child abuse! Oh, my God. - 'You fly high, you fly low.' 'You can sing the song of Moses and the Lamb. ' And Maxi was radical. CHRIS: Ooh, he sure was. Max would run to somebody's house next door and Max would say 'If you touch me, I'll break every glass.' CHRIS: Look at that one up here, he's beautiful. The little baby.

Because I remember him as being very like... like an army general. Yes. 'You go over there right now! You heard me!' And he would look at us with his eyes. Yes. Very like, like he could kill us. - SHE LAUGHS I remember that now, Ms Myrtle. See, you're bringing everything back to my mind. CHRIS: Because, see, you know Mas P better than I do because I was a child looking up at this monster. COINS JANGLE CHRIS: Hi, Grace. GRACE: Darling, when I'm there, I'm your neighbour. GRACE: Hi, darling. I love your palace. Oh, I love it. Ah! Yah, man, me remember you walking down the street. You had a special walk, you know. - CHRIS LAUGHS You know that? You had a walk.

GRACE: Oh, my God. CHRIS: She felt he didn't like us at all. That's what she felt. I asked her that question earlier. GRACE: He never gave any love. - CHRIS: No. MS MYRTLE: No, no. - GRACE: Never. Never love. The love was, 'I'm going to beat you because I love you.' It was always about, 'It's because I love you I'm going to, you know, discipline you.' And I remember I used to paint... - Paint your fingers. You remember that? - MS MYRTLE LAUGHS CHRIS: But that was a big thing in those days. I would paint it and before Mas P come home, me take it off. Yes, take it off. - You remember that? Some pink nail polish, that hot pink, like, Sixties nail polish.

It's so wide. Love the light. MUSIC PLAYS IN BACKGROUND It's too wide to get it. Mmmm. Superb. I love a champagne breakfast, darling. Sorry. Because it makes you go back to sleep afterwards for, like, two or three hours. The performer out there takes a risk. And I always say to everyone 'If the lights should go out if the roof, the electricity, the sound fails I can still perform and hold the audience in the dark without any, without any trimmings.' Oh, yeah. I always know something can happen. And what do I do to keep the people from leaving the audience? Like in All About Eve when she goes, 'And I'm delighted to keep the people from leaving and walking out of the theatre!' D'you know what I mean? Cos then you have to improvise. If I forget the words, I'll make 'em up. No, it's... it's a lonely place, but it's a fascinating lonely place. In the dark, in the, in the, in the corner no light, and just... your voice. I mean... JEAN-PAUL GOUDE: Remember this, the dance you did? GRACE: Oh, yeah. LOUD MUSIC PLAYS Yes, it is. GRACE: It's men time. Instead of penetrating I think they all need to be penetrated once in their life. Just once. JEAN-PAUL: A woman? - GRACE: Man. JEAN-PAUL: Men? Why? GRACE: Because then they'll understand what it's like to receive instead of to... to... ...to give. Voilé. JEAN-PAUL: But is it the nature of man to receive? GRACE: I think so. JEAN-PAUL: Or is it the nature of man to give? GRACE: Of course. It's the nature of man to give and receive. JEAN-PAUL: Uh-huh. GRACE: Man, woman, meaning one man-woman. JEAN-PAUL: That's interesting. JEAN-PAUL: That's very good. It's more masculine. JEAN-PAUL: Do you know that you've gotten me very angry many, many times? GRACE: Of course. And I've done it on purpose to get you angry. GRACE: I have knowing... - JEAN-PAUL: Did I deserve that? GRACE: ...putting everything. It's almost like I put everything on the line. Like you go to Las Vegas and you know this is your last money, and I go... Wow!!! Do you know what I have to do to hit that note? GRACE: I'm sure you'll all know that I lived a lot in Paris. The father of my son is Jean-Paul Goude from Paris. Oh, we did a lot together. We did lots of pictures, you know, all those crazy ones that you all collect you know, the record covers, etc, etc. I'm a tragedian! THEY SING You should do it on stage. JEAN-PAUL: # La vie en noir... # Yes, no, because it's true, huh? And I feel like that when I'm singing it. JEAN-PAUL: How about Master Patrick? GRACE: Mas P? - JEAN-PAUL: Mas P. GRACE: God, he's born the same day as you, you know. Did you know that? JEAN-PAUL: The 8th of December? - GRACE: Yeah. JEAN-PAUL: Well, I'm not a woman beater. GRACE: No, you're not... SHE LAUGHS No, you don't have to. JEAN-PAUL: No. What do you mean? GRACE: No, my, my knees always go weak without even beating. It's like a cloth belt. Love does that. I mean, deep, deep love, for me, does that, you know. L... I always still say you're the only man made me buckle at my knees. Me? Buckle at your knees? Doing what? GRACE: Just doing nothing, coming up to see you... SHE CHUCKLES Mamma mia. But that has nothing to do with fear. GRACE: When I used to climb those stairs at, um... Union Square? Yeah. The knees would get weaker as I went up. That's a very strange sensation. JEAN-PAUL: But that had nothing to do with fear. Mm, mm, mm. Well, I don't know. I... I haven't really... I don't think it had to do with fear. It just had to do with the force and... and... and the, um the intensity of... of the feeling. Your breath gets a little like hyperventilating a bit. I stop halfway up and think I'm gonna have to get my composure. I don't wanna be seen like that. When I open the door and I come in I have to kind of, er, be... Mask it. Cover it. Yeah. JEAN-PAUL: Masking your emotions. - Yeah, abso... Yeah. JEAN-PAUL: Do you see yourself being alone when you're very old? This is possible. - Do you see yourself that way? But I don't see myself... I can see myself being, um, alone but not lonely. JEAN-PAUL: I see. That you wouldn't want to? Never. No. - You wouldn't wanna be lonely? No. - Are you ever lonely? No, because I find things to occupy myself with when I'm alone and... Like I say, I really get a big kick of staying up and watching the sun come up as the light is beautiful. As long as I think I can travel, if I'm stuck in a bed... Mmm-hm. GRACE: I want a view. I wanna see light changes, snow, seasons. And I watched my dad die. - Mm-hm. I watched him die and helped him die. And it was just the most... Actually, I wrote a song called "You Died a Beautiful Death, Dad." And when I die, I say I wanna die like you died. He... Something... His expression in his eyes was so amazing that he didn't wanna close them and I didn't want to close them. - PHONE RINGS It was just, you know... And all these things, they just happened to arrive because he wasn't sick it was some hospital mistake. It changed my life, actually. Changed my life. Because I was like, 'No, you can't close his eyes.' He still looks like living... I mean, it was just amazing. And he has these eyes from the Maroon tribe, I think it is, in Jamaica. Their eyes are dark but circled with the blue. Hm-hm, I've seen that. - Like from another planet. Wow, it was like watching a birth, watching a death, it was this... this transient place where he was just so... JEAN-PAUL: How did your mom react? - ...peaceful. INDISTINCT CONVERSATION IN FRENCH MOTHER SPEAKS FRENCH Look, the eyes are opening. MOTHER SPEAKS FRENCH GRACE: Not yet. CHATTER IN FRENCH CONTINUES GRACE: Hmm. Colour's amazing too, the eyes. I thought it was black, and Jean-Paul told me it's blue. PAULO: They're grey, they're blue-grey. MOTHER: It's dark blue. Ah! Hello! One half eye open. Daddy's here. Yeah, you can smell Daddy.

Any way I can leave them some money now to do the clearing? FATHER: To who? - GRACE: We'll see who's up there. MOTHER: We need to stop at Miss Ramsey and see if she's alive or the daughter. She could hardly make it up the hill with us the last time we came. FATHER: You see right up there? That's where we're going, right up the top. GRACE: Hello? Hello? WOMAN: Hello? GRACE: We're looking for Miss Ramsey. She could be dead, you know. MAN: Miss Ramsey, yeah. Who's this? GRACE: We're Pat Jones's family. OK. OK, Mr Jones. Who's Mr Jones, him?
