Yes, let's go check if he's okay. . Come on. . Hello. Sir, your job is done. Hello. - Doctor, the operation was successful. The patient is dead! - Fine. Hello. - Advocate. I have sent your client to his heavenly abode. Hello. - Khanna. I killed that bastard, Rakabh Singh. . You! Hello. Hello! Hello. Hello. Hello. . Hello. Hello. . Hello. . Hello. . Goddess Lakshmi, the owl is Your mount. And You even love Your idiotic devotees a lot. Then why don't You knock some sense into my stupid son? That jackass has his nose in a book from dawn to dusk. Knock some sense into that son of a dog, Goddess. Sir, why are you cursing yourself? Dhaniram, today is your lucky day. Today, I am in a mood to give something to someone. Wow! Wonderful, sir! I've never come across a philanthropist like you. You haven't seen one, right? Stop looking at me and check the accounts. What was I saying, Goddess? You were saying that you are the father of a jackass. Right. So, Goddess, please enlighten my son. Stop him from being a bookworm and make him develop an interest in girls so that he beguiles and marries the daughter of a rich man who will bring a lot of dowry. That way, I can lead a comfortable life in my old age. Sir, taking dowry is an offence! I think you have got a job somewhere else. Had that been the case, why would I have been in this hell? Then find a job for yourself because I fire you. Come on, get lost. - But what is my fault, sir? What did you just say? That taking dowry is an offence. . - No. . I said taking dowry is not an offence. It is not an offence. It is not an offence! Dad. See you. - Where are you going so early in the morning? College. - Goodness! Going there is of no use. Go someplace where girls hang out. Go to the lovers' lane. Find a girl for yourself, dear! God knows what you keep talking about! I really don't get it. I too didn't get it when I was your age. Later, my dad explained everything to me. And he got it. - Correct! - Yes! Listen, get me a daughter-in-law as soon as possible. Make sure she's from a rich family! - So, you are telling me to cheat a girl for the sake of money! If she is rich, cheat her parents, siblings. . Everyone. I will never do that. What! Not only you but also your dad will do it! Then do it. Who is stopping you? - Dhaniram! Mistake. . I made a mistake. I am naive. Suraj! Suraj. . - Sir. . Sir. . Oh, God! Oh, God! Knock some sense into my son! Sir, I think he is not your own son. Come closer. - Here you go. Hi! - Hi! - Hi! Wow! Her walk is so sexy. She is also very rich, pal. The guy she marries will be very lucky. If she marries me, my dad will go insane with joy. Your dad can go mad for all I care. She will get married only to my son. Get to it! Hey, where is he? Where is he? - Who. . Hey! Sir. . - Where is he? - Sir! Sir. . - Where is he? - Sir. . Sir. . - Where is he? - Sir! Sir. . - Where did he go? Sir. . - Where. . - Sir. . Sir, please tell me which dog has bitten you that you are running around in circles like a dog and trying to catch your own tail. I found a girl! - You found a girl! I found a girl! - Unbelievable! Sir, what will you do with a girl at this age? What! Dhaniram, at times, you make fun of me. Isn't it? Isn't it? I have found someone to brighten up my son's future. Sir. - Yes? - Seems like you've lost your mind. Ask me why. Ask me. Mr. Dhaniram. Why? - Listen. Sir, your son is brilliant. Why would he need someone to brighten up his future? Dhaniram. - Yes? Come closer. - Here you go. Closer. - Okay. Now, ask me why I slapped you. Ask me. - You are my boss. You can slap me without a reason. No, that's not true. Until your boss completes his sentence there is no need to interrupt him. Got it? - Yes, sir. I have found a rich girl for my Suraj! Hi, Dad. - There you go. My son, Suraj, has come at the right time. Listen, Suraj. Tomorrow, when your college gets over at 4 o'clock Shakuntala Devi's daughter will leave in her car. . She will leave for her house in her car. When she is passing through a deserted street two goons. . Two goons will come there and waylay her. They will try to molest her. Then you have to show up there. Then by using martial arts, which you have learnt. . You will use martial arts to save her. Then that girl will say 'I love you'. 'I love you. ' Then you will get the girl and both you and I will get her property! So, how is the idea? Where did he go? Suraj! - He will come back. But there's a problem with your plan. What's the problem? Actually, you will have to pay the goons. I had completely forgotten that, Mr. Dhaniram. - Correct. Here's what you need to do. - What? I will disguise myself as Billa and you need to disguise yourself as Ranga. Excuse me! Excuse me! What happened to you people? Nothing has happened to us, sweetheart! You are the one who's going to suffer now! Hey! What nonsense! Get out of my way! - What! Hey, girl! We have come to molest you. Hey! - What happened? She is going to be Suraj's wife. Mind your tongue. - Is that so? Come on. My Lady. Can we molest you, please? - What! You slapped my friend! I won't spare you! Looks like the hero of our drama has arrived. I will let you go only if he comes to your rescue my sweetheart! Rascal! - What. . You dare hit your father so hard! What. . This is someone else. Sir. . - Yes? - He is the villain, not the hero. He is good-for-nothing. Hey. . - Okay, go ahead. My back! Get up, rascals! Why are you running away? Come here, champions. Dhaniram. . - Yes? Y-You get beaten up. I shall increase your salary. No! - Go. . - I don't want your money! You get beaten up! - Hey. . Hold him! Hey! Hip-hip hurray. . You two hit me! He. . He hit you. You rascal! Let's go. Run! - Run! Where do you think you're going? Hey. . Leave my lungi. Leave my lungi. . My lungi! Leave my lungi! - What the. . When did you buy a pair of new underwear? Hey, rascal! Lungi! Get lost! Sir! Sir! I am over here, sir! Come on, sir! Thanks. Thank you very much. If you hadn't come on time. . - It's okay. I'll drop you home. Okay. What's the matter? Why is Tinku crying? Ma'am, Mr. Chunnu bit Tinku. - What! What's so shocking about it? Do you remember when Tinku had bitten me? I had to get 14 injections administered in my abdomen! I still have the marks! Should I show it to you? That's enough, Chunnu. You are such a fool! I am your brother's son after all. It's a family problem. - Shut up. Oh, God! When will I be rid of this problem? It will take time. And I am not in a hurry. Mom! Hey. . - Mom, do you know what happened today? I was returning from college when two goons waylaid me! But Mr. Sikander reached there and chased the goons away after thrashing them! Hey! Why did you stop there? Please come in. How can he come inside? I will interrogate him first. Which family he belongs to who he is related to what his breed is. . By the way, AIDS is on the rise these days. Brother Chunnu! He is my friend. Oh, come on. How is this possible? You met him today and you two have become friends! Your mother and I have been here for 25 years now but we haven't befriended each other yet. Chunnu, go upstairs. I don't plan on going anywhere. You can go if you wish. - Chunnu! Looks like he's crazy. Brother Chunnu is mentally. . - I-It's okay. Please come inside. Mom, this is Mr. Sikander. Greetings. I owe you, big time. Ma'am, I did it because I'm a good Samaritan. . Ramu! - Yes, ma'am? Make some tea for us, quickly. - Sure. And tell Dinu to water the plants. He left for his village this morning. He left for his village? Who will do the chores then? I will do it, ma'am. Dinu has sent me as his replacement. What's your name? Raghu. - All right. Ma'am, I'd like to take your leave now otherwise my dad will be worried. Your father loves you very much. I am his only son. I am the sole heir to the property that's worth crores of rupees. Goodbye! He is a good boy. Things did not turn out the way I thought they would! I am done for! Let him come back! I will teach him such a lesson. . First, you must learn a lesson. That you will never go after money. Why shouldn't I? Great! He got beaten black and blue yet he hasn't learnt his lesson. Had Suraj come there on time. . - Yes? ... we would have welcomed the girl along with her property. Yes. . - It's okay. I will try again. You can go alone. I won't accompany you. - Why? Don't you get your salary from me? I don't get paid for getting beaten up. Looks like Suraj is here. Where are my shoes? My shoes. Shoes? - Yes. You left your shoes on the street. What happened? I have suffered a loss of Rs. 47! - Oh, dear. . Hi, Dad! - What. . What happened to you? Dhaniram, look at him. He's acting all innocent! - Yes. . I had asked you to be there at 4 p. m. ! You didn't reach there. Someone else showed up. And he thrashed sir so much that he's in terrible shape! - Shut up! Why are you rubbing salt into my wound? Sir, we are out of salt. For the last four days, I've been having Dal which has no salt in it. Shut up! First, tell me. Where were you? I had got a flat tyre. God. . My back! Listen. . Listen, lie down. I'll get some turmeric milk for you. You will feel better as soon as you drink it. If I knew that I would get some milk after getting beaten up I would have let that guy thrash me a little more. Dhaniram. - Yes? Come closer. - Here I am. Hi, Dad! Idiot! - What the. . Did you get beaten up? I am not like you that I'll get thrashed for no reason. - What! I fought a few goons and also impressed a girl. Idiot! I never taught you anything other than caring for money. What do you think? That I ended up giving my heart to that girl? No, Dad. No! I have come to tell you that you need to get a safe made because I'll be getting my hands on a ton of money. You may have heard about this kind of wealth but I bet you've never seen it. Rs. 10 crores! What the. . Dad! My late father! Dad! - What. . - Dad. . Sikander. . For the first time I feel that I am lucky to have a son like you. But you made a mistake, Dad. I am a king not your son. - What! Oh, God! What nonsense. . Hey. . Leave me! No. . No! Well done, Mr. Romeo. Very well done! They show this kind of situation in films. An empty street. A lonesome girl. A few goons. The girl is about to be molested. So, the hero was bound to show up. You showed up at the right time. You protected my honour. Even I have a duty, you know. I have to give you my heart. Otherwise, how will our love story start? Right? - What! This is an old method to impress girls. You need to come up with a new approach. Do you get it? "Today, I have blossomed into a young lady. " Water the plants. "I was a budding flower. Now, I am a garden. " Water the plants. "My shoes are from Japan. . " "My beloved!" "My beloved. . " - Listen. . Dear, you are here! We are so fortunate that you graced us with your presence. Sir, are you Suraj's father? That's what his mom used to say. But I still can't believe it. - What! He is naive. - Okay. . - He utters rubbish. Dhaniram. . Come inside. Don't worry about me. Go help Suraj. He ended up hurting himself while trying to protect me. He is bleeding profusely. It doesn't matter. When your good fortune knocks at the door injuries mean nothing. Please come inside. - I can't understand anything. Why are you people saying such crazy things? When a beggar wins the lottery, he tends to go crazy. What! He is naive. He utters rubbish. Dhaniram! Come inside. Sir, let's take Suraj inside. The girl will follow him. Naive. . Dhaniram, for the first time, you have said something smart. Come. - Come. Mr. Dhaniram. - Yes? - Please call the doctor. No, there's no need to do that. You tell me. What will you eat? Do you want to drink something? Why are you staring at us? Go inside and get something. There is nothing in the kitchen. Then get something from the market. Three years ago, the shopkeepers stopped giving us things on credit. Sir. . - Yes? - Don't worry about me. Please! It's imperative that Suraj regains consciousness. He has sustained a severe blow to the head. You are getting worked up because you don't know him. Can you see that cliff? One day, Suraj was flying a kite there. He slipped. He tumbled down. . He fell into my lap. I was really worried. My accountant was worried. - I was more worried than he was. He ran to the doctor. What did he see when he came back? I saw that the doctor was standing here while Suraj was again standing on the cliff flying a kite. He was flying a kite. He will regain consciousness. Sit comfortably. - Okay, I will. Hey! You sit, dear. Take a seat. I think we've hit the bulls-eye. Sir. . - Yes? It's been five hours. - Yes. . The poor girl hasn't eaten or drank anything. If you allow me, should I serve her some food? Dhaniram. - Yes? - She isn't hungry or thirsty. She is completely full. - How is that? Love has made her content. - Oh. . She is drunk with love. - Oh. . - Oh, my! Dear. . Dear. . - Yes? It's really late. You should go home otherwise your family will be worried. But. . He isn't running away, is he? Come back in the morning. - Okay. . - Okay? Dear, do come in the morning. Otherwise, he will start screaming as soon as he wakes up. He will ask me as to why I let you go! He will say that his life has been ruined! Okay. Dhaniram. - Yes? Well, what do you think of her? You've already planned to rob her father of all his money. She doesn't have a father! She just has a mother. Then maybe she will be smitten with you. Dhaniram! He is naive. He is making a mistake. She is back! She is back! Where had you been? Mom. . Mom, you know Suraj? He got hurt on his head, Mom. He lost a lot of blood. Was he fighting with someone? Yes, Brother Chunnu. Just like yesterday, some goons were after me today as well. Then what happened? He got hurt while trying to save me. You tied your dupatta on his wound. You don't need to go to Suraj's house to bring that dupatta. I will forget that you came home in this state. Even you need to forget that you left your dupatta somewhere. - Okay. Go change your clothes, quickly. We will be waiting for you to join us for dinner. What is this, Aunt? She merely forgot to bring her dupatta. It wasn't an expensive necklace, you know. A woman's honour is more precious than any piece of jewellery. When a woman uses a piece of cloth, which represents her honour to nurse someone's wound she's not doing him just a favour. It becomes something else. 'A woman's honour is more precious than any piece of jewellery. ' 'When a woman uses a piece of cloth, which represents her honour' 'to nurse someone's wound' 'she's not doing him just a favour. ' 'It becomes something else. ' Dad. . - Don't get up, lie down. Don't get up, lie down. . - Yes. . It's 9 a. m. I have to go to college. The purpose of your life has walked into your life. You don't need to go to college. I have found my purpose? - Yes. I can't. . - Oh, my child! You are a great actor! It was wrong of me to think that he is foolish. Mr. Dhaniram, what has happened to dad? Why is he uttering nonsense? I can't understand anything. He isn't speaking. He has lost his mind. You have done what he wanted you to. Me? - Yes. . - What have I done? Touch your head. Oh, I got it. You are talking about that arrogant girl. - Yes. But. . But who brought me home? She is the one who brought you home, dear. But she is no arrogant girl. She took care of you all night. She massaged your arms. She massaged your legs. I bet even Goddess Sita didn't take such good care of Lord Ram. I tried to convince her to go home but she said that she wanted to take care of the person who protected her honour. She started crying. She left at 5 a. m. But, sir, she left last night itself. Go for an eye check-up. - What! Can't you tell the difference between day and night? Sir, I got it. You see, you become blind when you see money and you consider others to be blind as well. What! - Sir, I am naive. I made a mistake. I am naive. Who could it be so early in the morning? I am sure it's her! - What! I am sure it's her! "I can't sleep. I am restless. " "I have lost my heart. " Do you think this is a musical performance? - What. . Go get the door! Greetings, Mr. Dhaniram. - God bless you, dear. Did Suraj regain consciousness? Being conscious is of no use if a man speaks as though he is unconscious. - What. . See for yourself. Okay. . - Go. Let's go out. We don't want to play gooseberry, do we? I got it, sir. - Then let's go. - Let's go. Damn fool. You! - Are you still angry with me? I agree, I misunderstood you. You can punish me for that. I have nothing. I can neither punish nor reward you. But I have everything. That's exactly why I want to stay away from you. Why? Can't we be good friends? - Yes, we can. But your wealth can sour our friendship. That will never happen. What if it does? I will sacrifice myself for the sake of our friendship. Really? "O beloved, the moment our eyes met" "my love for you soared. " "My love and your obsession" "may fade away tomorrow. " "Come, embrace me. " "Come, embrace me. " "O beloved, the moment our eyes met" "my love for you soared. " "Your love and my obsession" "may fade away tomorrow. " "Come, embrace me. " "Come, embrace me. " "Since the day I met you" "anxiety has become my new identity. " "No matter where I am, your face flashes before my eyes. " "When I look into the mirror, I see your face. " "Your words. . Your warm breath. . There's fragrance in your breath. " "I'm out of control. You're out of control. " "I don't know how to deal with it anymore. " "I've started to love you even more. " "Our inner voices and feelings for each other" "may disappear tomorrow. " "Come, embrace me. " "Come, embrace me. " "Come, embrace me. " "Come, embrace me. " "My yearning for you keeps surging. " "You are giving me sleepless nights. " "Even I spend my nights, tossing and turning. " "I think both of us are going through the same thing. " "If you can't talk, say it with your eyes. " "Staying away from you is arduous. " "Let us use gestures to express our love for each other. " "I'll tell you a few things. You tell me a few things. " "These memorable meetings and lovely moments" "may not exist tomorrow. " "Come, embrace me. " "Come, embrace me. " "Come, embrace me. " "Come, embrace me. " What's the matter, my son? How come you're drinking before sunset today? Yes, I'm drinking before sunset. Why don't you have a peg too? Coming to the wealth that you are after someone else is going to acquire it. I'm not an idiot that someone can take advantage of me. My son, if drinking could solve all problems our nation would have drowned in it. Tell me the name of the man who wants to kill our dreams. Suraj. - Father's name? - Mangtaram. Okay. . It's that stingy man, right? Even if there's a fly in his cup of tea he drinks it up, right? - Yes, he's the one. Sikander, it's time to celebrate because tomorrow morning, Suraj will be out of your life. How? Mr. Mangtaram is going to put an end to his son, Suraj's, love affair. Mr. Khanna. We hardly know each other. How can you interfere in my private matters? This matter has become public now. That's why I'm having this conversation with you. It's my duty to caution you against the danger. Goodbye. Just a minute. If it turns out that you have falsely accused my daughter then I don't want to see you anywhere near this place. What if it turns out to be true? In that case, you will always be welcome here. You will be considered a good friend. Only a friend! A friend can become family too, right, Shakuntala Devi? Probably. Hi, Mom. Hi, Sikander! Why are you all so quiet? What's the matter, Mom? Where were you? - At Suraj's place. You must stop seeing Suraj from tomorrow. - Why? Because I say so! Your pet dogs have brought some information for you, right? I don't care much for barking dogs. - Roshni! Now that you've involved outsiders in our private matters I would like to tell you something. I love Suraj. That's all. Since Roshni called me a dog I think it's time to prove my loyalty. Is this a house or a playground? Oh, my. . Hey. . Careful. Welcome. We had been waiting for you. What the. . Where did that voice come from? Who's Mangtaram out of the two of you? The one who looks like a beggar. - What! It's me. But let me tell you something first. My name's not Mangtaram. It's Mangatram. But the whole city calls you Mangtaram. You see, my mom couldn't have a child. I was adopted. None of the clothes they had fit me. I couldn't have roamed around nude, right? My dad went to an orphanage and got me some clothes that fit me. I got used to begging right from childhood. I used to beg my neighbours for some food and would eat it at night for dinner. By the way, what's your name? Don't try to act smart, Mangtaram. You've chosen the right family. - What do you mean? Let me explain it to you. Roshni is my only daughter. She's the sole heir to the property that's worth crores of rupees. Your son tricked her into falling in love with him. Shakuntala Devi. We may be poor but we don't disrespect two lovers. My son and I can kiss your wealth goodbye! But we can't let go of Roshni! Lower your arm. - Why? Your kurta is torn in the armpits, which reflects your standard. Seems like it was all in vain. . Sir. . - Hey, don't intervene! Torn clothes can be sewn but dignity once lost can never be regained! Wow. . Sir. . - Exactly! Listen. This is yours now. Mine? - Yes. Sir, first, ask him why he is giving you money. He is giving me something, not taking something. - Okay. . We will take something from you. We just need your word. - What! From now on, your son will stop dreaming about Roshni. Are you talking about blinding him? - Yes. In that case, take Rs. 5 lakhs from me and have yourself treated because you'll be made blind. Goodbye. - Wait. What is it? These are for you too. Dhaniram. - Yes, sir? Have we entered the Reserve Bank of India? No, sir, you have reached a slaughterhouse. Why? - Because you're selling your son the way people sell their animals. Hey, at times, people even sell their daughters. At least I am better than them. Yes. . - I am a son's father. But, sir, this deal will cost you dearly. This deal will benefit me. Ask me how. Hey, ask me, will you? - Me? - Yes. How? I always wanted my son to marry a girl who brings a lot of riches with her. But here, we are getting paid to break a relationship! Give them to me. Remember, you gave us your word. I have got it in writing. Read it. From now on, Suraj will stay away from Roshni. Absolutely! Let's go. Hurry up. - Yes. . Shakuntala Devi, don't you worry. Suraj will be gone from Roshni's life, forever. I will keep him under check. But that will be difficult. . - Hey. . Mr. Mangatram, what is this? Hey, this is money, silly girl. My son is not a prince, is he? He won't let go of wealth for his lover. I always choose wealth over lovers. Mom, why had Suraj's father come here? He came here to trade Suraj's love for you with money. That is a lie. I knew you would say that. Here you go. Read it. 'It's our family business' 'to take wealth in exchange for love. ' 'I can do anything for money. ' 'I never loved you nor will I ever love you in the future. ' 'I love nothing but money. ' 'For me, money is everything. ' 'Suraj. ' 'Hey, this is money, silly girl. ' 'My son is not a prince, is he?' 'He won't let go of wealth for his lover. ' 'I always choose wealth over lovers. ' Roshni. Don't cry, my dear. Don't. - Mom! Mom! - No, my dear! Roshni. We are fortunate to have discovered Suraj's motives now itself. Your life would've been ruined had we come to know about it later. Parents always make things better for their kids not worse. I have chosen Sikander for you after giving it a lot of thought. Mom. . Mom, do whatever you think is right. Whatever you think. . - Roshni. 'Hey, this is money, silly girl. ' 'My son is not a prince, is he?' 'He won't let go of wealth for his lover. ' 'I always choose wealth over lovers. ' Roshni! Roshni! Stop, Roshni! Why are you avoiding me? What has happened to you? Me? Am I the one who's avoiding you, Suraj? Or. . I told you on that very day that your wealth can sour our friendship. But. . But do you remember what you said? That you would rather die than end our friendship. What a way to keep a promise! Before I could commit suicide you and your father killed me from the inside! What! Here you go, read it. Dad! Come, my jackpot! Look, this is Reena, Meena, Sheena and Tina! Pick whoever you like. You should be ashamed of yourself! How could you. . - Hey. . One needs to be young at heart. The heart always stays young. My body may have aged but not my heart. You destroyed my dreams to fulfil yours? Dad. . I can't live without Roshni. . - What does Roshni have that Tina and Meena lack? Reena and Sheena are the same too. You can check if you like. Today, I am ashamed to be your son! And I am proud to have a son like you who got me all this money. That means, you traded my love for money! But I got money in exchange for it, right? Is money everything for you? What about me? Doesn't my happiness matter to you? My son, money can buy all kinds of happiness. I will leave this house then! Go buy a new son with this money! Sir, stop him, he really is leaving! Hey, if I stop him, I will lose these heavenly luxuries. Then why don't you tell him that you're not his father? Dhaniram! - I won't stay quiet just because you're raising your voice. You are not a father but a butcher! Someone who slaughters a kid for some money even if it begs for mercy. - Dhaniram, mind your tongue! What will you do? What will you do? At the most, you will fire me, right? But a person who couldn't be a good father can't be a good employer. Mr. Mangtaram, today, I am convinced that Suraj is not your son. Dhaniram! - You bought him from somewhere! Shut up! My lust for money had blinded me, my son. For a few moments, I had forgotten that you mean the world to me. In this ignorance, I even forgot that you are the only family I have got. Set fire to these stacks of money. I only need my son. I want to see him happy. That's it. What is the use of all this, Dad? You already obliterated my love. Tomorrow is her engagement. If I can sell my dignity for Rs. 10 lakhs I can pay double the amount to buy it back. Dad? Can I say something, my son? There is no currency in this world that can separate a son from his father. There is no such currency. Thank you. . Thank you. . - Greetings. Welcome. . Hi, Doctor! - Hi, Khanna! I was waiting for you. Welcome, Doctor. This party seemed boring without you. - Really? - Yes. Now that you're here, you'll bring life to the party. Khanna, didn't you arrange for some girls for our entertainment? Rascal, you're growing old but you still hit on young women. Khanna, a man never forgets his heydays no matter how old he gets. There are plenty of single women in this party. You can find one for yourself. I will get you engaged as well. Khanna! He is destined to be with a widow, not a young lady. Any woman who ends up with him will be unlucky! Hello. . Is she the one whose husband was killed by us 18 years ago. . Someone might hear our conversation. I got it, Khanna. I got it. I see that you have befriended an enemy. Let's go. Come on. Come, Mr. Jagatpal. Sikander, meet my friend. - Hello. . - Come. . Meet my son. . - Congratulations, dear. Dear, you can exchange the rings. Stop! Who are you? Khanna, I think your eyesight is becoming poor. Otherwise, you would have recognised me. Mr. Dhaniram. - Yes? Tell them who I am. - This is my boss. - Yes. . Yesterday, he had come to you with a plea. - Yes. . He wanted to make a deal with you. - Yes. . And you paid him money in exchange for his son's love. - Yes. . And he was so greedy that he took the money. - Yes. . You thought that Sikander had won and Suraj had lost! You were mistaken. My boss has been wicked for the last 50 years but he mended his ways overnight. - Oh, yes! My boss has realised his mistakes. - Yes. Here's the money you gave him, Rs. 10 lakhs. You gave it to him to stop his son from marrying Roshni. Here's Rs. 10 lakhs more. If your son dares to eye my would-be daughter-in-law I will gouge his eyes out. Shakuntala. . Shakuntala. . Shakuntala Devi. The groom and the groom's procession are waiting at the door. Please welcome them. If you won't welcome them then I will do it. Suraj! "No force can keep us apart.

First, I'll deal with that worthless guy. What are you going to do to Suraj? What are you going to do? I will get him beaten up! Like this? In this manner? Tell me! Don't you dare hurt Suraj! D-Don't you dare! Hi, Khanna. The party was fun! That guy sang splendidly. 'No force can keep us apart. ' 'We'll never get separated. ' Mathur, stop this nonsense! We have already been humiliated! Why are you making it worse? Khanna, there's an old saying. . 'A bad workman blames his tools. ' You always speak like a loser. You don't have any children. You don't know how it feels when your child is in pain! If you had a son and he got cheated by a girl then you would. . - No one can treat your son if you don't reveal what illness he's suffering from. What are you implying? Your son doesn't love Roshni, Khanna. He loves her wealth. But Roshni loves Suraj. So, you and your son are not going to acquire Roshni's inheritance namely, crores of rupees. So, you lost a chance to acquire a lot of money. Correct. I can help you with it. - How? I know a secret owing to which, Ms. Shakuntala would rather let her daughter die than allow her to marry Suraj. Really, Doctor? What's that secret? You have grown very greedy, Khanna. You want to acquire all that wealth for yourself. Tell me what you want. Rs. 50 lakhs. Rs. 50 lakhs! - Rs. 50 lakhs. Tomorrow, come to me with Rs. 50 lakhs and then I'll help you. Okay. . Good luck. Rs. 50 lakhs! What are you thinking about, Dad? I am thinking of a way to trick him into telling me that secret without me having to pay him. Avinash, whenever I come close to you, you drive me crazy. Even I am crazy in love with you. That's why I'm still single. - I love you, Avinash. Come on! Who could it be at this hour? It might be Khanna. Go hide, quickly. Come in! Come in, Khanna. Mathur, hurry up and tell me the secret so that. . Relax, Khanna. Relax. . Don't be in a hurry. I will tell you the secret. Do you have the money? It's in this bag. So, listen. Mathur, did you really think that I am a fool to pay you Rs. 50 lakhs for telling me this secret? Anyone could have found out about it real easily. Khanna, don't try to act smart. I might be a doctor, whose occupation is to heal people but I am also capable of making your life miserable. So, are you going to kill me? - Yes. I am capable of killing you. I am ready to pay you Rs. 50 lakhs for telling me that secret. - Good. But how much are you going to pay me for keeping your secret? Which secret? This secret! Mathur, I am not an idiot that you can take advantage of me. Bye! What do we do now? What if he tells my husband? Don't worry about him. I will deal with him. Who is it? My name is Khanna. - How does that concern me? It does concern you, Mangtaram. You might not know me but I know you very well. If your son, Suraj, dares to meet Roshni again I will tell her the truth about him. You won't be alive to do that, Khanna. Go away! What happened? Ms. Roshni hasn't eaten anything for two days now. Roshni. Dear, how long are you going to starve yourself? Do you think that I feel happy to see you in this state? You'll understand my point when you become a parent. A mother suffers immensely when her child is in pain. Please get up, Roshni. Get up! Roshni. Roshni! You! - Yes, it's me. Where is Roshni? Roshni went to her lover's house.

" Are you the one who had made the call? - Yes. Where is the dead body? - Follow me. Sir, a lighter. . Don't touch anything. - Why, sir? Otherwise, the fingerprints of the murderer will get erased. - Oh, my God! Are you an inspector from the British era? Idiot! I am totally Indian. I hate people who still follow the British style. My name is Inspector Rambhajan Singh. Thank you, Inspector. - No need to thank me. Because this lighter belongs to you. But how did this end up with you? Even I can't tell you that. Only he can explain it. Banke Laal, what is his name? Satish Ganna. No, I mean Khanna. - Yes, he. But he is no more in this world. He has left for his heavenly abode. Is Khanna dead? - He has been murdered. And your lighter was found near his dead body. Doctor, why did you kill him? Tell me. I am not in a hurry. Think well before answering me. Banke Laal. - Yes? In the meanwhile, get a handcuff of his size. Okay. - Hail India. Hello. - It is me, Dr. Mathur. - You! Why have you called now? He is at home. If he comes to know of it then I'll be in trouble. - I am in trouble now. Why? What happened? That inspector has got a suspicion that I have murdered Khanna. - Hang up now. I'll come to meet you in the evening after making some excuse. Who had called? - It was my friend, Sangeeta. Sangeeta? - You don't know her. That poor lady has been sick for a couple of days. I am thinking of visiting her this evening. - Okay. You should definitely visit her. You never know when someone might breathe their last. But you will get bored being alone at home, right? Even I forgot to tell you. One of my friend from college days has got transferred to this city. I am going to meet him this evening. - Oh! I'll return late in the night. Don't wait for me. Oh! Okay, darling. Bye. - Bye. What? I am coming. Sir, whoever the murderer is. . - Yes. ... he is very cruel. Yes. - He has stabbed both of them with a sharp weapon. - Yes. Banke Laal. - Yes. You are partially right. How is that? What is this? - A bullet. A bullet! It means that these two have not only been stabbed but also been shot. Yes. - Did you understand, blabbermouth? - Yes. Sir, if you promise not to hit me then I want to tell you something. Actually, I'm a bit confused. Go ahead. I was partially right, but you are completely wrong. Banke Laal! - Please don't feel upset, sir. When the murderer had shot them, why did he stab them? And when he had stabbed them, why did he shoot them? Because there are two culprits and not one. Kalka Singh, it's you! Yes, Jagatpal, it's me. What were you doing? I was watering the plants. Were you watering the plants or hiding the blood stains? The person, whose hands are already stained with blood shouldn't accuse others. You are absolutely right, sir. One thief can't accuse another thief of the theft. What if he's a thief? There are certain rules to be followed. Inspector, do you know whom you are talking to? I know! I'm talking to Kalka Singh and advocate, Jagatpal Sharma who went missing 18 years ago after sentencing Mr. Mohanlal's murderer, Rakabh Singh to imprisonment. Even the police department had closed that file. But after 14 years, Rakabh Singh was killed in a truck accident as soon as he was released. Not only that. The truck driver who killed him was also murdered. So, the government handed over that file to me and I'm here! Even before I could begin the investigation your friends, Dr. Mathur and Mr. Khanna were murdered. I suspect that these murders were being carried out for the wealth that went missing from Mr. Mohanlal's safe. One among you four is definitely the culprit. Two of them were killed, and you both are alive. Be careful with each other. I'm having fun! I'm having fun in life! Scoundrels! They were planning to ruin my son's life. Both of them got killed. That scoundrel, Khanna! He used to say that. . 'Don't take me lightly. ' But I got rid of him easily. And that scoundrel, doctor! He used to take shelter in others house and he tried to set my house on fire. At last, there was no one to perform his last rites. Sir, if you want to take a stroll why don't you go to a ground? Why are you walking here? I'm not taking a stroll but pondering. Then why don't you sit in a place and think? The rattling noise from your shoes is disturbing my sleep. You moron! Have you come here to work or to sleep? Ever since you joined our department neither the murderers are getting any sleep nor you. The murderer is on a killing spree and I am dying of this suspense. Hey! You idiot! Fool! He's sleeping like a log! Hey, you! - Yes, sir? Tell Shakuntala Devi that Inspector Rambhajan Singh is here to meet her. Go! Yes, sir. How may I help you, Inspector? I was passing by. So, I thought, I would meet you on the way. This is Mr. Mohanlal's photograph, right? Yes, but why do you want to know it? The job of being a police officer is strange. We have the habit of digging the past. I didn't get you. Even I don't seem to understand. I'm trying to find the link between the clues. What are you talking about? About 18 years ago, Rakabh Singh, a driver was nabbed for murdering his boss, Mr. Mohanlal. He was accused of asking Rs. 500 from his boss for his wife's treatment. When his boss refused to give him the money he killed him. And he was sentenced to be imprisoned for 14 years. Tell me something. Where were you when your husband was killed? I was at my parents' house because I was pregnant with Roshni. I didn't even see that traitor's face. I wish, he had come in front of me. I would have killed him! I regret that your wish can't be fulfilled in this life. Because when Rakabh Singh was released from the prison after completing the sentence of 14 years he was killed in a truck accident. - What? Yes, Shakuntala Devi. Mr. Mohanlal's murder file which was now ages old was handed over to me after 14 years. Because that truck driver who had killed Rakabh Singh was also murdered. Don't be astonished. In the grief of losing your husband you have forgotten that jewellery worth Rs. 20 lakhs were stolen from your husband's safe on the same day. Yes, but the police said that the jewellery couldn't be recovered from Rakabh Singh. - Correct! If the jewellery couldn't be recovered from Rakabh Singh then where is it? Where did it disappear without any trace? - Inspector! I hope, the jewellery wasn't taken away from the safe before he was murdered. Once Rakabh Singh was released from the jail the culprit might have got scared that the truth will be revealed. And hence, Rakabh Singh was murdered. Inspector, are you in your senses? Do you know what you are saying and whom you are talking to? I think, I troubled you. It's my responsibility to tell this to you. Dr. Mathur, Mr. Khanna and Mrs. Jagatpal's murder is not a coincidence. These murders are linked to your husband's death. Please be careful. By the way, who else stays with you? Hello, Aunt! He's Chunnu, my brother's son. Greetings! - Greetings! And my daughter, Roshni. I didn't get to see your daughter. Where is she? "I am a lover. " "I am a wanderer. " "I am a lover and a wanderer.

But, Mom, I love Suraj. . - You know very well that I don't change my decisions. Then you should also know that I am your daughter. Even I don't change my decisions. I would rather die than live without Suraj. Get out of my way. Move! Your life is precious to me. So, I won't kill you. But if you refuse to listen to your mother then I will kill the one who is precious to you. Abdul, this revolver has six bullets. If my wife-to-be steps outside the house before the wedding put all the six bullets in Suraj's heart. So, Mrs. Roshni Sikander Khanna if you still want to go out, you may. No one will stop you. Are these people stopping you? Hey, move. Move aside. . Go. Please, go. Go. Sikander, you have won this round. Take your men and return day after tomorrow with the wedding procession. Thank you. Come on, guys. This is not just an invite to Roshni's wedding this is Shakuntala Devi's call for war against us. If my blood flows in your veins then go and kidnap her daughter. I'll take care of the rest. Go! Hey, where do you think you are going? Roshni. Suraj. Suraj! Suraj. . - Roshni, I am here to take you somewhere far. Really, Suraj? - Yes. Chunnu, shoot this bastard! I will shoot every single bastard who dares to come between them. Chunnu! - Shut up, you old hag. Do you think you have bought my loyalty by offering two meals a day? Roshni, my dear, you should run away with Suraj. You will get truckloads of money in this house but you will find love only with Suraj. Go, my dear. Go with him. Chunnu. . - It's okay. Inspector Rambhajan speaking. This is Shakuntala Devi. - Yes, tell me. How can I help you? A ruffian has fled with my daughter. What is his name? - Suraj. Oh, that guy. Son of Mangtaram, right? Yes, he's the one. - No way, ma'am. You must be mistaken. He can't do such a thing. He is so naive that he can't even flee on his own let alone flee with your daughter. I think that your daughter has eloped with him. Inspector, do you even know who you are talking to? I want my daughter in next 24 hours and that boy should be locked up in the jail. Why are you screaming so loud at this age? Talk softly. You may fall short of breath. Shut up! - Excuse me, ma'am! I am a servant of the Government of India and not a servant at your house. . Hey. . Nonsense. Hey, Banke Laal. Come with me. Let's see what Suraj is up to. "I can't live without you even for a moment. " "I will go crazy in love" "without you. " "Without you. " "Without you.

He is not the God. He is a police officer. - They are the ones who people worship these days. - Is it so? Yes. - How are you? Inspector, why did you take the trouble? You could have called for me and I would have come to you. I'm here for the same. I'm here to take all of you to the police station. Dhaniram. - Yes. Is it 15th of August today? Is he here to take me for the flag hoisting? - Sir. . - Yes? It's not 15th of August today. - Then? - It's 1st of April. Where is Roshni? Sir, I think he is blind. Hey, stop whispering amongst yourselves. Just tell me where's Ms. Shakuntala Devi's daughter Roshni? She must be at her own house. But what's the problem? A complaint has been made against your son that he has eloped with Ms. Shakuntala Devi's daughter who is a minor. - That's not true. Inspector, I'm an adult and I came here with Suraj willingly. But your mom was saying. . - My mom has lied to you. Actually, I love Suraj. And my mom is forcing me to marry Sikander. So, that simply means your mom is a villain in your love story. Do this, dear. Go home right now. What? - Only the cowards elope to get married. You are in love, aren't you? So, even your wedding will take place with pomp and show. Suraj will come to pick you up tomorrow. Go home right now. Go, dear. Dear. Here you go, dear. If Suraj's mom was with us today she would have done some amazing embroidery work on this dress, herself. Here you go. Listen, it's a very important day tomorrow. On one hand, you will have Sikander as the groom and on the other, Suraj. If you wear this wedding dress tomorrow Suraj's love will be honoured. All this is not going to help, Aunt. You still have time. Stop this wedding. Or else, your. . - Chunnu keep your advice to yourself. Roshni. . - Yes? Why are you sitting in the dark? Are you asking me this after taking away the happiness of my life? I have nurtured you in my womb for nine months and given birth to you. I have nurtured you with my milk and brought you up. Don't I even deserve to choose your life partner? You are not demanding your rights. Instead, you are asking me to pay a price for giving birth to me. I don't care what you think it to be. The wedding procession will be here soon. Get dressed in this wedding dress and come downstairs. It is not my wedding dress but my shroud. This will remain a wedding dress if you agree to this marriage. But if you refuse, people will think that your wedding dress turned out to be my shroud. 'This will remain a wedding dress' 'if you agree to this marriage. ' 'If you refuse, people will think' 'that your wedding dress' 'turned out to be my shroud. ' 'Listen, it's a very important day tomorrow. ' 'On one hand, you will have Sikander as the groom' 'and on the other, Suraj. ' 'If you wear this wedding dress tomorrow' 'Suraj's love will be honoured. ' 'This will remain wedding dress' 'if you agree to this marriage. ' 'If you refuse, people will think' 'that your wedding dress' 'turned out to be my shroud. ' 'Suraj's love will be honoured. ' 'Your wedding dress turned out to be my shroud. ' 'Suraj's love will be honoured. ' 'Your wedding dress turned out to be my shroud. ' 'Suraj's love will be honoured. ' 'Your wedding dress turned out to be my shroud. ' 'Suraj's love will be honoured. - It turned out to be a shroud. ' 'Suraj's love will be honoured. . ' The auspicious time is getting over. Please summon the bride here. Chunnu, go and get Roshni. Wait! Who is he? Ma'am, just order me. My henchmen will finish him off in no time. Suraj it would be in your interest that you leave from here. I will go but only after taking Roshni with me. Perhaps, you don't love your life. Had it been the case I wouldn't have come here putting my life at risk. I am warning you. Stop! Otherwise. . Otherwise, what will you do? Are you going to riddle my chest with bullets? Will your aides chop me into pieces? Is that all? Don't try to scare me with death. I have come here prepared to die. You have claimed your love for Roshni earlier as well. But you have always lost. What you presumed to be my defeat was my first step towards success. And now my destiny is right in front of me. Stop! - Hey, you blabbermouth! Do you have the licence for this rifle? I have a big problem with this policy of the government. A licence should be issued not to own the gun but for having the guts to use it. If you have the courage, fire the gun. Do you have the courage? He is taking away my wife. . - Shut up! She is of your daughter's age and you want to marry her! Suraj take Roshni and leave from here. I will take care of all these people. Both of you stand up and exchange garlands. Stop! Roshni, before you destroy your life I want to tell you something. Roshni, perhaps, you don't know who I am. But I know this guy quite well who is the son of a criminal. He is not the son of Mangtaram but is the son of the murderer, Rakabh Singh. Do you mean the same Rakabh Singh who had killed my father? Yes, Roshni. Your mother became a widow at a very young age because his father killed your father. You lost your father even before you were born. This is a lie. Suraj is my son. By adopting him, he doesn't become your own son, Mangtaram. He is not your blood instead, he is the blood of that murderer, Rakabh Singh. He had killed his employer, Mr. Mohanlal for a trivial sum of Rs. 500. If you don't believe my words then this newspaper is the proof that his father, Rakabh Singh had murdered your father, Mr. Mohanlal. Read this file carefully. It is clearly written in this that Suraj is the son of the murderer, Rakabh Singh and was adopted by Mangtaram. Suraj is the son of your father's murderer. Suraj's father had taken your father away from you. Even after his death, do you want your father's soul to suffer to roam around to be in agony and keep cursing himself that he would've been better off being childless than having a daughter like you? Do you want to make the son of the murderer who made your mother a widow, her son-in-law? Tell me, Roshni, answer me. What is your answer to my questions? Tell me. Jagatpal, in these 14 years I had built my family with great difficulty. You came here and destroyed everything. I swear on my son that I'll kill you! I'll kill you! 'Can't we even be good friends?' 'Of course, we can. ' 'But your wealth will become the enemy of our friendship. ' 'That will never happen. ' 'What if it happens?' 'I would rather die than break our friendship.

But Mr. Mangtaram has always loved you like his own child. This is something that happened 18 years ago. Your father, Rakabh Singh was working as a driver for Mr. Mohanlal. Your mother fell sick all of a sudden one day. Rakabh Singh didn't have money to buy the medicines. He walked out of the hospital leaving your mother in such a critical condition and he never returned. Your mother died then. You were sitting next to her and weeping. Mr. Mangtaram heard you cry who had a wife who gave birth to a dead child thrice. And the doctors claimed that his wife might die due to the trauma. He picked you up. Fate is so astonishing. Mr. Mangtaram got a son but his wife passed away. On the other hand Rakabh Singh went to ask his employer for a loan. He was accused of stealing jewellery worth Rs. 20 lakhs from Mr. Mohanlal's treasury. He was also accused of murder. Sikander. Now, be a good boy and sign the papers. The wealth you will inherit from Ms. Shakuntala after your marriage even I will be a 50 percent partner of that. I will sign. Tell me something. For whom are you collecting such a large sum of money? Neither do you have a family, nor any loved ones. In fact, even your wife is. . Whom do you have, Sikander? Even you don't have anyone. Then why are you. . I have my entire life ahead of me. You can depart at any point in time. . Sikander life hasn't burdened me as much as the lives which I have taken. One more thing, maybe, you haven't seen my lifeline. Take a close look. I will die after your funeral. Goodbye. Goodbye! I will make sure that I end your life tonight itself. Abdul! You have broken the locks of several vaults. This man has my life trapped in a vault. This job should be done tonight. Even if you have to kill Jagatpal for it. Okay, sir. Jagatpal. You! Hello, Sikander here. Mr. Sikander, it's me. Abdul. Yes, Abdul. Tell me. Is the job done? Someone else did it before me. What do you mean? - I mean that person took the papers from the vault and that person murdered Mr. Jagatpal. Who murdered him? Someone you can never guess. His name is. . Hello. Jagatpal. You ruined my life and you are sleeping peacefully! Isn't it? Get up! Get up, you scoundrel! If you have the courage then say it again that Suraj isn't my son. Say it! Sir, there is blood on the knife. Mangtaram, what all have you stolen from this vault? I didn't come here to steal, I came to kill him. I have done it. Dad. . What have you done? Why did you do this? What else could I do? Jagatpal ruined your life. I couldn't do anything about it. Roshni left you stranded at the wedding altar. Your life was ruined and I couldn't do anything. I couldn't cope with your grief, dear. Your anguish was causing me sufferance. That's why, I killed him. I kept stabbing him until he died. If anyone ever tries to harm you then I will kill that person as well. Dear, I can bear with everything but I can't bear to see you cry. . I got you when you were an infant. I have brought you up in a loving manner. You didn't have a mother. I used to sing lullabies and put you to bed. I had so many dreams. That lawyer ruined everything. He ruined everything. Dad. . Would I have died if I wouldn't have got Roshni? I would've survived but I won't be able to survive if I lose you. Why are you crying? I have no regrets. I am ready to die but I plea before the Almighty that you get the love of your life. I would like to meet Ms. Shakuntala before I am hanged to death. I will beg her to send Roshni to our house. I would beg for your happiness. I will ask her not to punish you for your father's misdeeds. I will beg before her. I will beg before her! Hello. Sir. This is Abdul. Who is that? He always had a part to play in all the robberies of the city. He was an expert at unlocking vaults. Do something. - Tell me, sir. Ask the telephone exchange whom he called, from here. Okay. I didn't kill him! I know. But what are you doing here? Inspector, Khanna, Jagatpal, Mathur and I had dreamed of building a hotel ages ago. Those three aren't alive anymore. That's why I had come to invite Khanna's son for the inauguration of my hotel. I see. Let me tell you something, Mr. Kalka Singh. You're next on the murderer's list. Be vigilant. Did dad really kill the lawyer? Your dad, Rakabh Singh, is not a murderer and neither is Mangtaram. Advocate Jagatpal wasn't killed by Mangtaram. The killer committed the murder and escaped but Mangtaram was caught. Similarly, Mohanlal wasn't killed by your dad, Rakabh Singh. Suraj. - Roshni. . Looks like you, too, are here to cut your ties with me the son of a murderer. . - Stop it, Suraj. . I heard everything he said. If you guys want the real killer to be caught you will have to help me. "I don't want to live" "if I don't have you in my life. " "I do not care about my heart" "if it doesn't have an image of yours in it. " "I don't want to live" "if I don't have you in my life. " "I do not care about my heart" "if it doesn't have an image of yours in it. " "You insane lover of mine, tell me what you want!" "Tell me what you want. . " "I just want your heart. What else would I want?" "What else would I want. . " "I just want your heart. What else would I want?" "What's the point of my heartbeat" "if my heart doesn't skip a beat when your name is mentioned?" "I do not care about my heart" "if it doesn't have an image of yours in it. " "I don't want to live if I don't have you in my life. " "I want you around me all the time. " "I want you around me. . " "I want you all the time. You define love for me. " "You define love for me. . " "I want you all the time. You define love for me. " "I don't want my eyes if they don't dream about you. " "I don't want to live if I don't have you in my life. " "I do not care about my heart" "if it doesn't have an image of yours in it. " It's you! Something is wrong! What happened. . - Who hit him. . Don't worry. The operation was successful. He'll regain his senses in an hour. Thank you. - Good luck. Just as Kalka Singh regains his senses we'll get the killer. The wounds look like they were caused by a knife. I can't touch them yet. The police has to be informed first. Can't you see where you're going! Get lost! Murder. . Hey! Stop! If you don't stop walking, I will shoot you. I said, stop! Or I'll shoot you! What have you done? He is my patient. He is deaf and mute. Nurse! He is a patient. So, where did the killer go? It's you. So, you're the killer, Rakabh Singh. Why don't you kill me, too? Perhaps killing your own son will end your killing spree. I would rather die than live as a killer's son. I wasn't a born killer. I was forced to become one! My mind was poisoned to an extent of becoming a murderer! I vividly remember that night. I left you with your mom on that night in this very hospital. Get the medicines. Doctor, I'll get it straight away. Hurry up, or she might die. Doctor, please don't say that. Dear, take care of your mom. I'll be right back. Take a look at it! It's a proof of your illegal and criminal activities. Look! I'm going to call up the police and get you arrested. Those scoundrels framed me in the murder of Mr. Mohanlal and the court sentenced me to 14 years of imprisonment. When I got released from the jail after 14 years those scoundrels tried to kill me with a truck! But you survived. And you killed the truck driver before anybody. Then you came over here in search of your enemies. Rakabh Singh, there's something that I don't understand. I know that you killed the Kanva but how come we found the doctor's lighter at the crime scene? After murdering him, I dropped the lighter there. You had no enmity with Jagatpal's wife. Why did you kill her? I killed the doctor. . And I was about to flee from there. . Suddenly, the doctor's wife entered the room. She spotted me. In order to save my life, I ended up taking hers. And before I could leave that place I saw Lawyer Jagatpal entering the house. I switched off the lights right away and hid in the bathroom. Along with the police, even Jagatpal thought that he killed both of them. And then I got rid of him, too. Sikander wasn't your enemy. Why did you kill him then? Like father like son. The father ruined my life. And the son was trying to ruin my son's life. So, I killed him! Kalka Singh was my last target. If you had not made my son sleep in his bed I would have put an end to his life today! Your game ends here, Rakabh Singh. Surrender yourself. No. I will not surrender until I kill Kalka Singh. The game is not yet ended. Rakabh Singh, stop! Now, you can arrest me. Come, hug me. Come. . "I'm a lover. I'm a vagabond. " "I'm madly in love with you. " "I live to love. Love is my full time job. " "I live to love. Love is my full time job. . " "I'm a bit insane and a bit crazy. "
