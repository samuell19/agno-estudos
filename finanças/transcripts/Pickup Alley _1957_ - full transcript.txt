Thanks a lot Narcotics Bureau, will you put me through to Charles Sturgis? Quickly please. - Not here. - Alright then, Murphy something. - Murphy. - Hello Mr. Murphy. I've been trying to locate Charles, can you get a message to him? Go ahead. Tell him I think it's worked. The man that I'm to meet is from Philadelphia and they call him Mac. - It's Frank McNally, I'm certain of it. - No one is seen him? I know no one is seen him but this is the man. - How did you play it? - They think I'm an addict and I need it. Now listen, he's calling here and then we're going to a club. - Will you have somebody follow me? - Sure. Charles, if possible. - You all right? - Sure, I'm all right. I'm shaking like a leaf but it'll pass. - Take it easy. - Bye. Hi sweetie. - Hello. - You look swell this evening. I should've dressed for you. Forgive me honey. Find yourself a table doll. - Frank, Frank, Joe won't let me work... - Fade honey, fade. - Tell him, will you? - The usual Joe. - I can still push the stuff around for you. - Did you hear me? I'm good enough for that, ain't I? How's it going? - Like clockwork, I can never understand it. - You ought to by now. Yeah maybe, I still don't get the percentage. Somebody wants to get real loaded, that I can understand. It's normal, if you know what I mean but this I don't get. Never figure how guys get themselves hooked like this. Stuff, makes you happy, makes me happy. It's all money. Joe, I want you to do something for me, get hold of Jack... give him some dough, tell him to lie low for a couple of weeks. Something is cooking on the other side I want to give it my personal attention. I'll need to see Jack when I come back. - Like clockwork? - That's what I've said. See you Joe. Move along. Sorry about your kid sister Charles, we just couldn't get you in time. Break it up there. The show is over.

No, no, don't. No, no, no. Let me go, let me go. No. Well, where have you been? Crawling around on my belly in the gutter looking for dope peddlers, needle pushers. The same filthy thing day in and day out. I get a little tired too. I'd like to get a hold of a couple of million dollars from one of these foundations... to hire a few doctors, find out why people keep sticking needles in themselves. I'd like to do that a lot. But I'm too busy here trying to find out how the junk gets into the country. I figure that's more important, I get discouraged too. Every now and again we get some little junkie in here who's... so far down the line he's making half a buck profit on a 20 dollars shot. He doesn't even know what year it is, never mind who's hiring him. - It doesn't seem to add up, does it? - Is that all? No, that's not all. If you'd quit playing the personal crusader and check with the... department once in a while, you might find out what you're accomplishing. Just what are we accomplishing? We got the little joker in here who's supplying your waitress friend. - Just another slimy, broken down. - Who knows? Listen... all right, so your contact said his name is Cashling. I, I didn't get his name. - Would you recognize him? - I guess so, if I saw him. I got news for you Moscar, you going to see him. Now. Is that the guy? Take him out. Sit down Cashling. We want to hear some more about this friend of yours, what's his name? - McNally? - I told you all about him yesterday. You know what morphine is and what it does to you? You asked me that yesterday too. And you know you can't just bring it ashore like that. Well I, look guys... everybody tries to pick up a little extra. Yesterday you told us about a man you met in a bar in Bordeaux. - I'd like to check those names again. - What names? Start with the name of the man you met in the bar. I just happened to meet him, it was just a guy, didn't hear his name. Well, suppose you tell us the names you did hear. Look, I don't want to get in no kind of trouble. Cashling, you're in so much trouble now it's going to make your ears wiggle. You can help yourself if you quit stalling, tell us everything you know. I heard him talk about one guy called Salko and Guido. Go on. - Well then, there was this Mac character. - McNally, concentrate on McNally. Tell us everything you know about him, everything. Oh, he was some kind of a big shot. Frank McNally, I think his name was, but he used to change around quite a bit. He could be O'Connell sometimes and O'Hara. Interpol figures he's back in the same old racket under a new name. Yeah, what you got? Radio from Interpol London, to Narcotics Bureau, New York. Information received that McNally's partner, Jabbo Salko living here under false papers. - You require any action from us? - Tell them to sit on him, keep him on ice. Murphy, I've told you a dozen times that Salko is in Europe. And wherever he is, McNally can't be far away. Now, let's stop kidding each other and send me over there. - I'll think about it. - That's all you do is think about it. Oh, you stop trying to fight a one man war? I'll let you know. What's eating him? - He wants to bring in McNally. - Well, why not? Now, it's a bit before your time, Sturgis' sister used to work for us. McNally murdered her. Before that I figured Sturgis was the best man we ever had. He still is. This is to Interpol Paris. Notify London, interested Salko. Hold immediate action pending arrival tomorrow our representative, Charles Sturgis. Interpol is making the world smaller every day now to the international criminal. By turning up a file, Interpol can tell you if a crook smokes Turkish cigarettes... - twitches his nose when talking... - Or hates spaghetti? - What is Salko hate? - Rights. It was here in the Mediterranean that this particular group caused the most trouble. Tangiers Marseilles, Naples. Cigarettes on the whole, you understand. Got quite nasty in the end. Quite a surprising number of the chaps turned up dead or disappeared. Most of the survivors we feel... are doing morphine and heroin and that sort of stuff now. That was McNally's old line. All we have on McNally is a sort of composite mental picture, no one is ever seen him. There no photographs. He works behind other people. We've heard it said that he's insane. And the only way we can find him is through one of his lurid friends. About this Salko? Salko, he's had a go at a bit of everything, including white slavery, But he's been quite discreet lately. Changed everything about himself, his methods, his habits, his name, even his face. Taken himself apart you might say. But we've put him back together again, like Humpty-Dumpty. With the aid of three or four other countries. He's in for a big surprise. Take a look at the arctic brute. You'll find him changed, of course, largely for the worse. Anyway, we're paying him a visit later on today. Go inside. You needn't wait. Shut your mouth. How long have you been working for us? How long have you been working for the company? - I didn't hear what you said. - I'm in a hurry. If everything is all right, may I have the case back? Stay around a while. You know something? You're very beautiful. What have they done with Salko? Get Allison over here with his little brush. Looks as though somebody is taken Humpty-Dumpty apart again. Ah, a woman. Lovely set of prints. Couldn't ask for better if you invited her around to the yard. Well, let's get to work and see if we can find a few more. Right sir. Well, look who's here. Frank, please get rid of them. I can't spoil the party darling, it only started yesterday. - But, Frank, I got to talk. - Come on, I want to talk to you now. You've been a naughty girl. Back in a minute, a little business chums. A very naughty girl. I've heard all about it, you scared a little darling? Yes, I know how you feel, the first kill is always a bit trying. I'd no idea you were such a good shot. You must try one of those relaxing pills or that hot stuff they advertise... - before you go to sleep. - Don't joke Frank. If you won't help me, I don't know who will. I'll help you doll. It's just going to be a little expensive, that's all. I'll take care of everything, my partner is no great loss. You haven't got to worry about anything, you just go on looking beautiful. I wish someone would paint you, I wish I could. I'd rather see you hung in the royal academy than, well, than just hung. Fortunately, my partner hasn't been around much lately, he won't be missed. Now, I've got something I want you to do for me. No. Things are moving rather fast for me just now, I'm going to need you. - Find somebody else. - And you're going to need me Gina. - Just leave me along. - Alone? Have you any idea what would happen to you if I left you alone? Don't you know what happens to girls who shoot people? The law is very strict about this sort of thing you know. It says you can't go around shooting people... no matter how unpleasant you find their advances. Awfully silly isn't it? But there you are. But when you have good friends to take care of things, Yes, now. I have to go presently, I have to see some people later on tonight. I'm going to Rome in the morning, I want you to go to Lisbon. Your tickets are in here, this is where I want you to go in Lisbon... something I want you to pick up there for me and bring it over to me in Rome. What is it? Just something I want you to pick up darling. - Will you meet me? - It's all taken care of. No, no, no, don't worry about what's happened today. Unless you decide not to do as I tell you, then you can start worrying. You see doll, we both need each other. Here's a little present for you. I may borrow it back later but just now it's yours. You just want me to get it through customs for you. Oh Gina no, don't so cruel. Say your mom gave it to you. Don't forget to smile at the boys. - Frank? - Yeah? Sometimes I think you are a little mad. Well, I got a certificate a long time ago to say I was sane. I'll bet you haven't got one. Quite coming through now sir. It's faster than I imagined. We're in luck, aren't we? Have verified fingerprints, code number 845 as Gina Broger... holding Greek passport, number 8241, issued Athens, 10th of April 1950. No known criminal record but friendly with McNally and Salko. Whereabouts at the present unknown. - Pretty good. Gilling? - Yes sir. - What the chances of finding her? - Pretty good. Take this down, will you? To Interpol Paris. Excellent and thanks very much. Will you please circularize all bureaus... and alert all immigration authorities? - How much Portuguese money have you? - About 5,000 escudos. How much Portuguese money do you have señorita? - 7,000 escudos. - Fine. Excuse me just a moment, please, senorita. Extraordinary these manyana countries, don't you think what? I don't suppose you've ever been in Bolivia? I'll give you a tip, never arrive in Bolivia on a Saturday, Sunday or Tuesday. Sorry to keep you waiting señorita. Thank you. Interpol Lisbon to Interpol London. Gina Broger arrived this morning. Registered Hotel Grande Nacional Estoril. Do you want surveillance? - Yes, I think we do, don't we? Reply yes. - How long will take me get down there? - You quite sure that that's the thing to do? - Quite sure. Ask Paris to tell Lisbon that Charles Sturgis is arriving. Wait here please. Madam? I'm looking for a valise or a case of some sort. For letters or jewelry? Your work was recommended by a Mr. Sulvana of Paris. He thought you might have something suitable. I believe I've just what you want. Entirely handmade, finest leather. Thank you madam. - Thank you señorita. - To the airport please. I will make please a personal call to Rome. The name is Guido Martinelli... Rome 498629. I think I know who it is, all right. The American, probably the one we were told about. - He's been following the girl. - Alright. Keep a lookout, if he shows up here, I'll look after him... or you can. Hi Baris. What did you say is this time our little cargo? I didn't say. - Heroin or morphine? - Any difference to you? I understand heroin is bringing bigger prices in the states. That's why it's heroin. You've been studying the fluctuating market, haven't you Baris? How are you getting it into Athens? Who would expect Lebanese opium... processed in Naples to go to New York by way of Athens? Brilliant, don't you think? When you sail? Anytime from the 10th on. I do not control the loading, you know? How much is there this time? Well, I must know, to judge the space, to make the best arrangements. - About 70 kilos. - 70 kilos? I haven't planned on so much. You realize this is worth 3 million dollars? You have been studying the market, haven't you Baris? I too understand you've made some very good buys in Tangiers, in industrial diamonds. It should easily cover your expenses. I see no reason why I shouldn't have a fair profit too. No, no, no, no. Under these circumstances... I cannot offer you my facilities for less than 50,000 dollars or the equivalent. No? - Perhaps you'd like to find someone else? - We're not going to quarrel Baris. There's not time, silly kids these, aren't they? They bring out the family man in me. - We will not quarrel. - No, we will not quarrel. But I'd like to give you a little warning. Don't try to blackmail me again or we might. See you around. Fasten your seat belts please. - Will you put your cigarette out please. - Sorry. How do you do? - Greetings, your excellency. - How do you do? - Madam. - Let's have a smile. Alitalia announce departure of flight number 11 for Naples. - Hello Mr. foster, you remember me? - Go away. I mistake you, I thought you were a friend of mine, you know? I apologize. Varolli, captain varolli, I was asked to meet you. The little case please. Thank you. Telephone miss Broger. - Telephone miss broger. - Thank you signora. Oh, here it is. I think there was much more to that skirmish on the field than met the eye. Perhaps so. That other plane, could you find out where it's gone? Of course. Connect me with airport please, I wish to speak with signor Borgese. Borgese, control. This is captain Varolli, which local plane left one hour ago? Yes captain. That will be number 11 to Napoli, arriving there at 18:32. Si, any minute now. There's a lot of stuff this time, you could retire on that. I intend to, you retire on this. - How much? - 5,000. - Could you make it 5 and a half? - No, I couldn't. - I took a big risk this time. - That's your problem. - Give me the keys, I'm in a hurry. - Work with you make me poor all my life. Life is pretty short amigo. - Usual arrangements Guido. - Right sir. I'm going back to Rome, I want you to follow me. - What about this car? - Oh, never mind, that's not your business. - I'll look after that. - Right, get to work. - How did you get in here? - You shouldn't leave your key in the door. Anyone might walk in, a crook or anyone. Thanks for the case. - Any trouble with customs? - Customs? No - How's my wandering girl? I suppose you came for those. Oh dear, they look much prettier on you than they do on me anyway... they're no problem, I'm more concerned at the moment with a certain gentleman... who appears to be interested in you. It may have something to do with Salko, of course. On the other hand, it may have something to do with me anyway he's following you. - Frank, I can't cope with this any longer. - Nonsense dear, look, it's 10 o'clock. I want you dressed and out of here in half an hour. Just take a walk, anywhere. You know the catacombs? My dear, you haven't been to Rome and not seen the catacombs? That's where you should finish your walk, be there at 12. Your key honey. Ciao. To the catacombs please. Whats the matter with you? You crazy? Here you are, get your guide books to the catacombs here. Don't get lost in the catacombs, spooky, spooky. Know where you are all the time. Aspirin, flashlights, alka seltzer? Ice pack? Ah Lady, everybody needs a guidebook. - Want to be able to tell the bones apart... - No, thank you. Christian bones from the pagan bones, eh? Complete historical information all about Bo... How about a flashlight? Very dark in the catacombs, spooky, spooky. Make sure you don't fall over, get a run in your stocking. Doesn't anybody want to buy a flashlight? Use any razor blades today Max? All types, kinds, genuine American razor blades. Best deal you can buy. Well, how about a flashlight for the catacombs? See your way in the dark. It's awfully dark down there Max. How about a nice tie? Genuine American silk ties. You really ought to have some of these blades Max, they're the most. This is the best deal you can buy. No? Well, how about some nice pictures of pretty girls, eh? I got a better idea, how about some sunglasses for the catacombs? Sunglasses for the catacombs Joe. Look Max, if you had some sunglasses, I'd buy them from you. You look like a man who writes home, how about a pen? We come now to what might with... historical justification, be termed the original catacombs of Rome. Since the ancient topographical name of this ground was Ad Catacumbas... from which the modern word catacomb is derived. And which was later extended to mean any subterranean burial ground. Throughout the 4th century, interments here were customary. But they became rarer towards the end of that century... and were entirely discontinued in the 5th. I would like everyone to keep together as... the arrangement of the catacombs is extremely complicated. - Narrow passages 2 and a half feet wide. - This way honey. Were excavated and furnished with loculi... or recesses in the walls exactly the length of the body to be interred. During the frequent devastation undergone by the city... the catacombs were also pillaged and injured. The first time on the occasion of a siege by the Goths in 537. You're Ok. I'm going to keep you on the move. - But why? - I don't have to tell you why. In a few days, you're going to Athens. Right now, get back to your hotel. Not that way, there's an exit over there, make it fast. It caused 28 wagon loads of bones of the saints to be deposited beneath the altar. The catacombs however, still enjoy the veneration of pilgrims and the devout. Now, pope Damasus I caused numerous restorations to be made... and staircases were constructed to facilitate the access of visitors. During the third century, the persecuted... Christians frequently sought sanctuary in the catacombs. Many of these unfortunates, as perhaps you know... suffered martyrdom here, in their very place of refuge. Now we come to the tombs of four bishops murdered in this very spot. Oh, I'm sorry, I should've warned you, the mask was cast after death. Miss... - Miss? - Can I help you signor? For a moment, I thought you could. Hey, you sure you don't want any razor blades today Max? - I use an electric razor. - You look like a man with a problem. I know, who hasn't? Who hasn't? I'm from New York myself. 121st Amsterdam Avenue. I got a bad break, you know how it is. They get one person mixed up with another person who... maybe was possibly mixed up in some kind of racket. Before you know where you are, they hand your exhibition papers. I got no complaints, some of the boys hold complaints. My name? Amalio. I do all right, you know how it is, buck here, buck there, six years now. For me, it's not too bad, so happens I'm familiar with the language. I like spaghetti all right, I keep in touch. So I sometimes find myself in a position to be of help, like now. As a friendly type offer, just let me say this, she ain't coming out Max. Not today. You're watching a dry hole, her and her friends left. They ain't going to show. - What friends? - Introduction type offer is over now Max. From here on in, strictly business. You wouldn't be interested in money, would you? I tell you what I'm going to do with you. I'm going to make you a real reasonable type offer. I think I get the picture here in a general way, you a cop or something like that? I see what you mean. Anyway, first thing I got to do is ask a few questions around... find out what the word is on this individual she meets down there who I think I recognize. - Interested? - It all depends who the individual is. I'll make a few phone calls, arrangements like that, for which... I get a keeper, eh? Say 50? Make it 25. I'm going to write you down a place, we meet later on tonight. If I come up with anything you want, you pay me say... - say 250. - It all depends what it is. Well, while you're making up your mind Max... be my guest, eh? - You crazy, come and dance. - I'll see you later. - It went wrong, a woman screamed. - Well? Afterward, he talked to the yank, the one that talks outside the catacombs. - He sells news to the police. - Does he now? Let's see if we can cook up something for him, something very special for Mr. Sturgis. - He's still tailing the girl. - Get her on the phone. - But if we... - Get her on the phone I want to talk to her. Hold up Max, I got something for you. It don't feel right in here tonight, if you know what I mean. One or two individual persons I don't recognize. We can have our little talk while we promenade along. - 200 Ok? - Depends on what you got. This individual that interests you, what did you say you thought his name was? - Mac something or other? - His name could be McNally. - What do you think it is? - I don't have that information yet. But I get the idea he had to go dark a couple of years ago, something in Tangiers. - Dark, what do you mean? - Dark, incognito, skippity hop. Bought himself a handful of all kinds passports. Got himself fixed up with a little plastic surgery. The name he uses depends on what day of the week it is. The only reason I was able to get this is... this is no popularity boy in some quarters I know. - Competitive business, you understand. - What business? - Happy stuff. - Amalio, I think I should tell you... if anyone does anything twisty with me, I get mad. Max, we was talking about 200 dollars? The first installment. I'll take you to a place. There's a hotel up that alley on your right. First floor, room seven. Walk right in, you're expected. Hello baby, got a light? Your friend tell me you wanted to see me. - Here I am. - I'll make it fast, sit down. The minute I'm tired of chasing you or anything happens to me... they'll pick you up faster than a 20 dollar gold piece. I sound fascinating. I stopped being fascinated by dope peddlers a long time ago. You can go on acting like you're brave if you want to... but you're in trouble, serious trouble. What I want from you is Frank McNally, you help me find him... and I'll do everything in my power to help you. Hey guard, egghead. For the 10th time, someone is made a mistake. Now, would you call captain Varolli, tell him that Sturgis is here. Have him to send someone down and get me out of this dump. Signore, you are here on captain Varolli's orders. - That's impossible. - It is for your own safety signore. I'll worry about my safety, just go call Varolli. - I think this will not be necessary signore. - What do you mean it won't be necessary? Be seated Mr.Sturgis. What's the idea of holding me in jail? I think my men have already explained that to you, please sit down. It may interest you to know... that at this moment you are the target of every thug in Rome who carries a gun. There's only one thug I care about. I understand that but there appear to be some things that you do not understand. Mr. Sturgis, I work not only for but with Interpol. Interpol is an organization that depends more on cooperation than on the kind... of rash individual action that you have just displayed. Commissioner Breckner in London, commissioner Rocquet in Paris. They are not only my associates but also my very close friends. When they ask me to do something, I do it. In this case, I've tried to work with you, to protect you, I've done my best. My men have done their best. In fact, it is quite possible one of them saved your life last night. If you want our cooperation in the future, then you must give us yours. We must work together, not at cross purposes. Alright, I'm wrong. Where's the girl? She left Rome for Athens this morning but... the Greek police have just arrested... someone who may interest you even more than miss Broger. A man, if you can call him that, by the name of Etienne Fayala. How is he fit in? London informed me that he worked for Salko and also, probably, for McNally. Interpol Athens to Interpol Rome. Etienne Fayala has confessed... he worked for Salko and McNally. Stop. He brought Salko to Athens and believes he is still alive and hiding here. Stop. Will hold action pending arrival interested parties. Very interested. If you go now to Champino airport, you can make connection with the London-Athens plane. This will get you on board the plane. On it, you will meet Mr Curtis from London. He is going to Athens to identify Fayala and also to take care of you. You'd better keep my cell dusted, I might be back. Hey Max, how did it shape up? Did you meet the girl all right? Yeah but you forgot to tell me that she had six boyfriends. Oh now hold it Max, don't get the wrong impression. Would I be here right now if I was going to cross you, eh? Just don't. You know where she is now? Athens - Athens? What would she be doing goofing off to a crazy place like Athens? Because she's a goof. Oh Amalio, if you ever need any extra change, I'll see you there. You know me Max, I hate money. Lovely old city Athens, always wanted to get a look at it. Let me see that picture of Fayala again. I try, I try to do as you say but... Fayala, we're getting very tired of following you around. - You helped bring Salko from London. - So you should know where he is. He's never in one place more than one or two days, he's always moving. I've got another idea, I got a friend, maybe he can help. - You're going now, eh? - Let's go. Watch the street. Come on. Come on. Where is this? Why am I coming here? I'm very tired, I'm not so strong to travel. Oh, why is that... You're coming here because this is where I want you. Don't worry now, I'm going to take care of you. You got everything you need here, so stay put. I would like to see the girl again. You'll let me see her again, I have something to say to her. I'm very hot, I'm in bad pain, I think I'm going to die. - These you got to sign. - I need something now. Yes, yes, come on here. I need some ready cash to operate with. In the interest of our partnership, after you sign. It's Salko. You got to move fast, your plane goes at five. - I'm not coming with you Frank. - No, we're going separately. We'll meet in New York, go straight to the Bellevue on Lexington. By the way, I'll need those bracelets, I'm running a bit short. But 2 weeks from now honey, don't worry, I'll have all the money a man can give a woman. - Here your tickets. - Frank, I meant I'm not coming with you. You are not going to tell me what to do anymore. You stupid girl, here your tickets. Do you realize I could've had any doll doing errands for me? But I never wanted any doll. We'll meet on the other side... If we don't, well, just think of Salko. See that she catches that plane. I'm going to be busy for a few hours, so don't look for me unless it's really urgent. - Not in here. - Ok, special information. - Bend your ear a minute Max? - What did you find out? I get around Max, it's my business. My business is your business. Don't bother with no introductions. - I got big news for you. - Very interested. Well, I figure you to betray my traveling expenses, printing costs, you understand. Got me a beautiful passport, cost me 100 bucks. Alright. Well, not to beat the cranberry bush, this is a major type operation. Merchandise headed for the States worth maybe five million. - Gina Broger has been located in Athens. - Yeah. Also I found out why your girl won't talk. She is very hot, from both sides. She put holes through an individual's head in London and the individual's name was... Silkas, Salky, Sucker, some cockamamie name like that you heard about it. You have her covered? - Let's go. - Car. Signore please, no. No. Got a light Max? I think I'll stick around a while, it's a character outside I want to keep my eye on. Play your cards right, you get a bonus. I'm trying to find McNally, it's urgent. The dockyard? Already? Alright, goodbye. Dockyard? I've got to get through to the Reo Allego. But this is very important. Excuse please. I'm sorry but do you know who this is? No, it can't be, it can't be. It's not true. He's dead, he's dead, I know he's dead. You shot him all right, but you didn't kill him. Someone else had that pleasure, someone you know very well. Captain, what's all this about a refrigerator coming aboard for you? To keep my beer cold, I'm paying for it myself. You held up sailing 3/4 of an hour because of that? It must be here at any moment, I shall sail the minute it is on board. The company makes the schedules captain, you'll follow them. You'll sail as soon as I get ashore whether your own personal comforts are aboard or not. You can gain nothing by remaining silent. For the last time, what can you tell us of the man you know as Frank McNally? This airway ticket to New York, did McNally give it to you? - Did he? - He'll kill me. Did McNally give you the airway ticket? Yes, yes. And you were to meet him in New York? Answer the question, were you or were you not arranging to meet him in New York? - If you don't try to help us... - I'm trying to help you, I am. If you really want to help us, tell me everything you know about McNally. How does he look now? Anything and everything that you can possibly think of... regardless how important you think it is. He is a man about 40, average height and build. Eyes blue, very penetrating. Does he have any special mannerisms of any kind? Telephone for Mr. Sturgis, it is urgent. - Hello? - Hello Max? I've been calling all over for you. Get your hat and coat on, information grade a type coming up. That individual I followed, seems like he's trying to get a message through to McNally. Just now, he was onto the dockyard asking for some ship... Ria Legra, some cockamamie name like that. Yeah, yeah. Anyway, just a minute ago, he went out of here and he stole a Fiat Van. - Did you get the number? - Natch, I got the number, A1595. Oh, and Max, I think this information's worth may... Glass of water. Get the cart out of the road, come on, hurry, hurry. There he is. Captain Baris. 8241 held by police. I think that's Gina Broger's passport number, let's check. You have a captain Baris working for this company? Yes sir, he is the skipper of the Reo Allego. - Where is she now? - She left port 10 minutes ago sir. - New York? - Yes sir, direct. How long is this captain been working for you? Not long sir, he is one of our relief personnel. Thanks. Pan American airways announcing the departure of flight 155 to New York.

Ho there. Stop or I'll shoot. Take it away. Ok bud, let's go. - Murphy. - Guy is been shot down at the docks. - We think it's McNally. - What? We'll need official identification before we stick him in the morgue. Well, is only one person can identify him. - Sturgis says for you to bring her down. - Ok. Have Gina Broger ready to travel in 5 minutes. Hope this will be the last body you'll ever have to identify. Well, that's it. - Break it up there. - Come along now, break it up there. - Ok, let's go. - Move along. Hey Max, Max. My brother gives me the word to look you up. My brother Amalio, that is. He couldn't get here personal on account of he's tied up in Italy right now. Just for a little while, if you know what I mean, a couple of years. The way I get it, there are a little monies due on the completion of the job. He says for you to pay me. Tell Amalio when he gets out, there's a little bonus for him. Much obliged Max. Hey, if you ever want a receipt, I'll mail it to you. - See you. - Don't take any wooden nickels I'll see you around. I'll say hello to the boy for you.
