There, that's it. You can call me doc. Although it may appear that I am your enemy- - You're a lunatic. Tell me what that thing is gonna do to m My mama always said the life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. I don't know what you want me to say. I can't even look at you right now. Do you think I can look at mysel I saw the tape. Don't pull away from me. You're all I have. I need you. Are you hurt? It's okay, you can talk to me. Hello. Are you okay? My name is Kris. Where are you? Your guess is as good as mine. What do you want? Nothing, I just wanna talk. Who are you? Kris, thought I told you, I'm Kris. You told me your name, but you didn't tell me who you are. You didn't tell me anything. So I'm winning. How long have you been here? I'm pretty sure he didn't inves in clocks calendars for blind people. Do you know what's going on? I was about to ask you the same thing. Does he talk to you? No. He just... He speaks, but it doesn't mean anything. He's a weirdo with a fetish for torture. He's probably listening to this conversation. I don't give a shit. He's a fucking nut job. Yeah, he's something. It's nice hearing someone else's voice. Why are you talking to me right now? I heard you freaking out. I figured you needed a friend. What I need is a way out. I guess we're friends now. How are we friends? We both need the same thing, so we're on the same team. I'm Ava. Nice to meet you, Ava. I've been seeing my memories, like a film of my life. What do you mean? Ava? Where are they? - Winter is coming early. - It's August. Yeah, I know but I can feel it. Can you smell it? Well, so that's your six sense now, isn't it, that you can just feel the weather? My sixth sense is knowing that you're about to be smart. God, that sounds exhausting. These things are gonna kill me, you know that. Apparently. - Can I have one? - Go ahead. What do you mean? Well, you don't want to smoke if you're gonna be pregnant, right? Are you serious? Yeah, I'm ready. That's great. Kris. Why does he come to you? He mostly sticks me with needle pokes and prods. Everything hurts like hell. How is he showing me my life? Does he stick you with needles too? Yeah. So he's drugging us. You're hallucinating. There were these guys in masks but they don't look normal. They stare at me like I'm in the zoo. Okay, it would have been better to start with that one. What do you mean they don't look normal? I don't know. I can't explain it. Do you have family? You? Jennifer. Not blood, but family, nonetheless. Been together forever. Any kids? I'm gonna get us out of here. How? I was tied up at first, but I'm not. I'm not now. So you think he trusts you. When a dog owner walk the dog off leas Yeah. It's a bit like that. He thinks he has control. So he's testing you. - Evan. - Hello Ava. What are you doing in here? I don't know how I got here. What do you mean? I right here. Don't come any closer. It's okay, I'm here. Where's Isaac, Ava? What did you do? Where's Isaac? Where's my son? You killed him. I should kill you. Dying is better than you deserve. Who is it? Oh, is it for me? Is it for me? Who is it? Hello? I think it's daddy. You wanna say hello? Hello. Hi, who is it? Who's on the phone? I ask for help. I don't know how. I didn't make it that far. There were these bodies. - Bodies? - Dead bodies. Stacked on top of each other. And then he grabbed me Ava, listen to me. You never left the room. I did leave. How do I even know you're real? You don't. You can believe whatever you want to believe. Maybe you're not real. Maybe you are a projection of my subconscious to help me deal with the trauma of my current situation. Look, we could either be skeptical of one another or put our heads together to try to escape. Isaac, that was my son's name. He always smiled. He was beautiful. I guess I just thought that if I didn't mourn, it wouldn't be real and it could just be a nightmare that I could wake up from. What happened? I turned my back. I turned my back for one second, just on It was my fault. So now I'm in hell. This is my hell. I deserve it. I'll spend the rest of my life talking to a hole in the wall. Hey, stop. Whatever happened, I'm sure it wasn't on purpose. He's gone. He was my world. Now this is my world. You should eat. Fuck you. Here, drink this. It will help with the nausea. I'm not nauseous. You will be. We need you strong, drink. No. I'm not doing this anymore. I'm not playing these games. Just kill me and get it over with. You are not in a position to make those kinds of requests. You are a troublesome one, are you not? No, I'm just done with the bullshit. Who are those freaks in the masks? So they visited? No, I don't buy it. You didn't do all of this and abduct me just so you can play doctor. I did not abduct you at all. I am, but a willing servant. Soon you will understand, or maybe not. Either way, it does not matter. Listen to them, children of the night, what music they make. Jennifer was my girlfriend. We were 16. My folks were hippies, super progressive but her parents, they were more old fashioned, crazy religious. I could always tell she felt a little guilty about us. But I pressured her. I pressured her not to be ashamed to tell her parents the truth about us. One day she did. She built up the courage and her mother disowned her. Her father tried to pray the gay away and when that didn't work, he tried to beat it out of her. She told me that she couldn't take it anymore. She killed herself. What I'm saying is that you're not the only one who has lost someone. And I know that a girlfriend isn't the same as a child, but you get my point. She didn't know how to keep fighting. She gave up. Kris, I'm not a fighter. Well, you have to be now. I bet your son doesn't blame you. It's okay to regret. It's also okay to keep living. Keep living for him. What do you want me to do? Get him to let his guard down. Ask him questions about himself, then when he least expects it, go for his throat. I can't. I can't do that. Yes you can. Once you get free, you come find me. Where have the calls gone? Are you sleepy? Oh hello. Isaac come away from the door, sweethear No, no, no no Isaac. Don't open the door. It's okay. Oh look. You wanna play some more? - Hello. - Hey Ava. - Yeah, hi. - How's it going? Oh, I'm good. - What about you? - I'm good. How's the little one? What are you guys doing today? Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're fine. We're fine, just Isaac and I were playing today. - Do you think maybe next week? - Yeah, sure. Yeah, that is so funny that you brought that up 'cause I was gonna talk to Evan about that later today. What do you do? Isaac. No, no, no, Isaac. Who are you? What do you want? What is this? No, no, no. You've killed me. Mommy, mommy. Come to mommy. You honestly think you're gonna get out of here? You had this coming. You're never getting out of here. Glad to see you waking up. You are quite fascinating. Again, please. Get away from me. You were given a special sedative. You've caused enough problems for one person. What are you doing? You are a curious one too. I am surprised by your resistance. At this point, most have given up. However you are entering the final phase of your process and you look at me as if you were somehow avoid fate. Priceless. Why not just let me die? Humans life is so fragile. Only worrying about life and death. Soon, you will worry about neither. Who are you? I do recall introducing myself. You speak like you're not part of humanity. - Humanity? - Human kind. Humans are not so kind, are they? You just did it again, you disconnect yourself? What we've got here is failure to communicate I'm not famous, I'm not important. Such arrogance, to think that I would want you for my own purposes, as if you were somehow, special. This is what humans do, you think that you are the center of the universe and nothing matters more than you. You are one, one of many that have, or will conform to their aspirations, their desires, not mine. These other people that you work for, when did you start working for them? As far as I can remember I've always been an agent for them. Tell me about them. What can I say that you do not already know? - I don't know anything. - Sure you do. They are more intelligent than you. They are superior to you and you're kind in every way. What do they want? More. Why did you do this to yourself? I didn't do this to myself. I was beginning to think that we're making progress. Progress? I found you laying in your own blood with one of my utensils near your person One might suggest that you are destructive and suicidal. I'm not suicidal. Momma says stupid is as stupid does. Why do you do that? Why do you speak in old movie quotes? I guess one could say that I am an aficionado of film. I've learned quite a bit from them. Really, how many have you seen? If memory serves me correctly, I've seen 213,980 films. Wow. What's your favorite? That is actually difficult to answer. I have an affinity for them all. Your top three. I love the smell of napalm in the morning. - "Apocalypse Now". - Very good. Another one of my favorites. Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn. "Gone With the Wind". I like classics. One more. Well, it's a tough one. Well, in all this excitement, I kind of lost track myself, but being this is the 44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. It blow your head clean off. You got to ask yourself one question. Do I feel lucky? Well, do you punk? I don't think that I've ever laughed quite like that. Well, what happens now? Now we move on to the progression phas A metamorphosis as such. A metamorphosis? They're building an infantry. It is quite marvelous. - You're insane. - Am I? I could say the same thing about you. Doing the same things over and over agai expecting different results. I noticed that you have taken one of my utensils again. It is of no importance. Your extremities will not operate at full capacity for some time. You are a troublesome one. Keep it as a souvenir. Goodnight caterpillar. In the dawn, do not be afraid to spread your wings and fly. I've never seen my own lifeblood pour before. Why so serious? Ava, Ava. Kris, yeah, I'm still here. He just moved me to another room. He's gone. He's gone. So what's the move now? We gotta figure something out before he comes back. No, I don't think he's coming back. Did you do it? I did something. He's not moving. Come get me so we can get out of here. Yeah, just give me a second, okay. Why? Are you all right? Yeah, I will be. I just need a minute. Well hurry, I can't take this anymore. Kris, I don't think he's human. He didn't bleed. Well not normally anyway. Are you slipping out again? No. What if he was telling the truth? The truth about what? Everything he said was rooted in crazy. Yeah, yeah. Maybe. Are you sure you're okay? What's taking so long? He gave me a sedative or something. I'm waiting for it to wear off but then I'm coming. Don't worry, I'm coming. Can't it be an award like a lollipop. Are you all right? Who's in here? Kris? What took you so long? What's going on? I can't explain. Just try. Just tell me what's happening. Didn't you take care of him? That's not him. So that's someone else. You can say that. So there are others. There's others out there. This isn't what we think it is. It's something else. So what happens when whoever is out there gets in here? Ava Tell me. We die. You okay? No. No, I'm not. She bit me. She bit you? How did you get away? I reacted. Kris, what are you doing? So if we open this door, we die and if we stay here, we die. Earlier, you said you didn't think that doctor guy was human. He bled blue. Okay. I'm not really following. But what about what's out here now? Do you think they might be human? What do we do now? What about the light? What about it? You said before you saw a light. I don't know where that is. I might not even be real. None of this might be real. Kris. I'm losing my mind. Well, you have looked better. Thanks. You're not real. Hasn't stopped you talking to me though, has it? What do you want, Evan? What do you want, Ava? I just wanna go home. I don't know what's sopping you. The universe. The universe, huh? Maybe the universe is trying to tell you something. Like what? How would I know? I'm not real, remember? You hate me, don't you? Yeah, yeah I do. I love the hell out of you too. I needed you. When we lost him, I needed you and you just left me alone. Do you now how hard that is? Do you remember the first time I asked you to marry me? It was like a fantasy, right? Soft sand beneath our toes. Sounds of the gentle waves cleansing the shore. Yeah, I said no. Yeah, that's right. Why did you say no, Ava? I wasn't ready. That's exactly my answer to your question. He's my son too, you know. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I miss him so much. I miss him too. Do you think this is my fate now? Come on Ava. You make your own fate. That sounds nice but... No. This is my punishment. I'm never gonna get out. Dying is better than I deserve, right? Yeah. That may be a little harsh, wouldn't it? Let me ask you a question. What if you deserve to be free, not just of this place, but everything? I think I deserve a drag. I haven't had one in ages. Go to the light.
