It'll probably take till morning Let's go and see They are borned yet? - Thanks - Make yourself comfortable The male is purebred from Onoda Gorozaemon's place It'll be a fine litter Our chief engineer, Mr. Mase, was asked by his mentor Professor Ueno Hidejiro of Tokyo To find him an Akita puppy When Aka was born We had a snowstorm for three days and nights We almost thought our house would collapse They are borned HACHI-KO MONOGATARI When you suddenly yelled out, "They are born!" I thought your wife had given birth I've already got five kids I couldn't handle another one Here's the house Professor Ueno is one of our country"s Top agricultural engineers And he's very' fond of dogs When I visited him last year, he had just lost his dog A female Akita... not a purebred though Please come He mentioned then that he wanted a purebred next time He'll be overjoyed I'll notify him right away May I use the phone? Right here I'd like Tokyo please Tokyo, Aoyama... number is 2007 Coming! His daughter is another dog lover It's a Mr. Mase from the Akita prefectural office Hello, this is Chizuko My parents are in Hakone at Tonosawa Hot Springs They go there every' year I'll be happy to take a message Yes? A dog? An Akita? You're giving it to us? That's wonderful! It was born this morning A fine looking pup! Today is December 16th So after the new year... Yes. I'll call my father right away Thank you so much! We're going to get an Akita puppy! A dog, again? What do you mean "again"? It's a purebred Akita! I must call Father. What's the number in Hakone? Look, a singing frog Welcome back Your daughter is on the line Really? Shall I put the call through to your room? Thank A man from the Akita prefectural office ...what was his name? Mase Right! Mr. Mase called A beautiful Akita puppy was born this morning He said that you had asked for one Not really... But Mase was there when Gonsuke died He said he'd send me an Akita So I just asked him to keep us in mind No more dogs Yes, well... it was a sad-time when Gonsuke died Even you cried So let's not get another dog It's too late to refuse! Mr. Mase really wants us to have it If you don't want it, I'll take care of it! I've always wanted a purebred Akita She says that, but I'm the one who'll have to take care of it Even when she found Gonsuke in front of the train station I had to do everything And I hate dogs! I hate cats AND dogs You promised me when Gonsuke died that We wouldn't have any more dogs But Chizuko insists Well, I'm opposed to it It's a purebred this time Purebred or mixed I don't want to go through that sadness again Chizuko says she'll take care of it Look, it's snowing Stay healthy now I hope they like him Take care I'm going out. Don't forget to pick up the dog - I pick up the dog. - Yes What's going on? I intended to go to the station with you But I changed my mind an hour ago I'm going to a concert at Hiblya Park Excuse me! It's Tsumoru! I'll be right down! I... I'm sorry'! That's an idea She's always so fickle Kiku! He's not here Where is he? It's urgent Oops! Sorry'! Hey, don't break it, will you? I'm right here Kiku... What's the big rush? There's a dog arriving at 3P. M. at Shibuya Station Another one besides Gonsuke? Gonsuke died last year He did? You're right... I took him to the crematory' myself If it's from Akita, it must be an Akita breed With a tail that curls tight Sorry' to interrupt I'm against having a dog But Miss Chizuko loves them People who love animals are kind You hate dogs because It's always your duty to clean the doghouse Miss Chizuko is so mean She was supposed to go to the station with me But suddenly, she changed her mind to go to a concert That fellow... her fiance came Naturally! She'd prefer him to a dog Will you go to the station with me? Go alone! I'm afraid of dogs That face of yours would scare dogs more I'll bet you're afraid of dogs too Come off it! At least a dog is better than a cat Feed a dog for three days and it'll be loyal for life But you can feed a cat for three years And it still won't care a whit! Saikichi, let's go! There's a box... where was it from? Odate It's from Odate... a dog The dog? Here you are Your seal, please I don't have it with me Look! This is for Ueno Hidejiro Don't you know Professor Ueno? I do, but... Well, you should! He's a famous agricultural engineer I'll get the seal, Kiku Never mind Recognize my face? No What kind of clerk are you?! Kiku of Inarizaka is pretty well known in this area Remember that, blockhead! - Now do you still need my seal? - Yes Your head's full of lead! Like the railroad tracks! Your thumbprint will do Why didn't you say so from the start! It's dead Hey! The railway company will pay for this! What's the matter? The dog they sent from Akita is dead The railway company's to blame! Is it really dead? And I'm not taking a dead dog! When live animals are transported The railway company is not responsible if it dies Welcome home What about the dog? Sailichi went to pick it up Didn't Chizuko go? She went to a concert with Mr. Morlyama Such a bad omen at the start of a new year Another dog's funeral Bound to happen... after riding a shaky train for two days Thanks, Kiku Hey Prof... The pup's dead What's the matter, pup? Get some milk Poor little thing I guess the journey was too long That's why I was against this It's dead, Prof... It's alive! It's drinking I'm home! You're home? Is the puppy here? The puppy's here - You've been back? - I am back. Is the puppy here? Welcome home I'll go and see it Welcome! You traveled so far Good boy! Father... You'll be responsible for the puppy It's not about the puppy What is it? About Tsumoru... I hear you went to a concert with him today He has something to discuss with you I know what he wants He wants me to get another friend into college But I don't believe in backdoor admissions It's not about that What then? I'm free this coming Sunday It has to be tonight Tonight? Yes All right Where is he? Outside Outside? He's waiting outside How rude! Why didn't you tell us? Shall I call him? Of course! Please sit Has he eaten? He doesn't want any Why didn't you show him in? It was very' thoughtless of you Yes? Yes Go on Yes I'm listening Well... Yes? Chizuko is with child And... I'm responsible Are you angry'? Well, after hearing whose child it is My blood pressure has gone down And so... I'd like to ask for her hand in marriage I see. Thank you Under the circumstances I think it's best to have the ceremony right away Have a nice day Have a nice day How's the dog? You're looking healthy You don't have a name yet Please don't choose a name like Gonsuke again But you can't go nameless Let's see... your forelegs are firmly grounded Just like the character for number eight So we'll name you Hachi as in 8 Like it, Hachi? We just got an Akita dog. Will you take it in? Not for me You're born in the year of the monkey? No, the boar A former student now at the Akita prefectural office Sent it to me My daughter wanted to keep it But she'll be getting married soon She is your only daughter, isn't she? Yes I had hoped to adopt a son-in-law But her fiance is also an only child So it won't work They're getting married in a bit of a hurry' On the 29th of this month Will you honor us by attending? Certainly And you also Ueno Chizuko Do you take this man To be your lawfully wedded husband? To have and to hold To love and to cherish To honor and obey In sickness and in health till death to you part? I do Chizuko didn't even shed a tear I noticed your eyes were watery' though When she said good bye from the train window The sadness suddenly hit me That my little girl was being taken away Were they tears of bitterness then? Tears of bitterness, joy, sadness... all at once I guess they've checked into the inn by now It was their honeymoon They could've gone farther than Atami Tsumoru wanted to save money He's very' stingy for his age But to think she was pregnant She'd have gotten pregnant sooner or later It was just sooner I was quite shocked by the whole thing What amazed me was the way she said "I'm not taking the dog" So bluntly, right before Morlyama When she offered all her love to Morlyama I couldn't help but stare at her He was quite speechless too, so I guess it worked Chizuko was only saying what was in her heart I wonder? Of course What will you do about Hachi? Chizuko asked me to take care of it I'm against it You're pretty adamant I'm not willing to share your love either Spin three times and bark! Spin three times! Spin and bark! Dumb dog! Ogata! Don't tease the dog! He's only a pup. He doesn't know any tricks yet Besides, I don't keep dogs so they can perform tricks Put yourself in the dog's place! Hachi is hungry'! Hurry' and feed him! You've already eaten, haven't you? Have a nice trip Watch Hachi while I'm away How long will you be away? They're cultivating the area now I want to check the progress so about four or five days Just as people have rights, canines have rights too I'll respect Hachi's rights Even if we're going to give him away We must protect his rights while he's staying here Have some tea, Sir Hachi! No! Hachi! Sailichi! My poor flowers! Hachi, if you want your rights to be respected Don't be so naughty! Babies have excess energy They can't sit still How old is the little one? Three months Imagine! Becoming a father at his age! I'm sorry'! How's Hachi? He's doing well Hi Hachi! I hear you ruined your mistress's garden Welcome home I think Hachi has grown You've only been away five days I see signs of intelligence in those eyes of yours, Hachi Do you understand me? What will you do about him? It' better to give him away while he's small Well Hachi? Do you want to be our dog? You want to stay? All right. I won't send you anywhere Fine day, isn't it? Such a cute dog Go on, Hachi Good day Isn't it hot? He's growing so fast Have a nice day Thank you, Hachi Now go on home Hachi! I hope you didn't chew on grass Will you go to the station again this evening? Gosh, it's so hot! Dear, look Good boy! Waited for me, did you? That's some dog This is no good Doesn't look like it'll stop Wonder if the dog's here He's waiting Thank you Good Hachi! Thank you for coming, Hachi. Even in this snow Father, happy new year Happy new year Happy new year Same to you Hasn't he grown big? Here's your grandfather! Was it all right to bring him in this cold weather? That's what I said Come inside, Chizuko Hasn't Hachi grown so big? Catching fleas suits you, Father! This is number 33 Let me carry' him Toru's gotten so heavy He doesn't talk yet Of course not. He's only three months old Has Professor been at it since morning? It's like a research project with him That's how he is Once he gets started he can't stop I think Father loves Hachi more than his own grandson Don't be silly I heard Hachi accompanies him to the station daily Yes And goes back at sundown to meet him Hachi doesn't wear a watch, but he knows the time Go to sleep Sleep well Shall we play some cards? Cards, huh? Better still, run a bath for me How is the water? Just fine, thank you He amazes me Does he bathe with Hachi all the time? Always... after catching the fleas Better watch out, Mother Or Hachi will take Father's love from you Excuse me You're good at it Won't you join us? No thank you Hachi might catch cold, so close the window You're soaking wet! It's all right now I didn't even notice a storm brewing I'll warm you up in no time Just you wait Come over here where it's warm Wait right here Dear... Hachi, are you all right? What is it? Is that all you can say? Do you prefer Hachi to me? What did you say? There's a limit to all this! 21-May-25 What's the matter, Hachi? Let's go Come on Good boy Now go on home Good morning Hachi! Settle down! Hachi! Hachi! You're barking so much What's the matter? The second stage can be recognized In the flooding that occurs every' five or ten years This circumstance is unusual The third stage would be The most critical range So called the pro... Probable maximum This probable... Professor! Someone, quick! It's too late Hachi! With the professor gone, this house is too big for me So I'll be going to live with Chizuko Why don't they come to here to live? Chizuko thinks this house is too dreary' She is so indifferent She was born in this house, wasn't she? I still sense my husband's presence in this house... And sometimes, it gets unbearable I plan to sell this house You two have worked here for many years But I must let you go now It's not much, but I'll pay you half a year's salary So please start giving some thought to your future I'll go back home to Narashino Sailichi? I think I'll return to Shizuoka I'd like you to have a memento of the professor Is there anything you want in particular? I'd like his hat The fedora? No, the silk hat All right And you, Oyoshi? I'd like a pair of his shoes For your father? If I ever marry' and have a son I'll let him wear it And tell him that it belonged to the good professor When he went on his walks, I loved to watch his back Hachi... Good bye, Hachi Good bye, Hachi Please take care of yourself Thank you Thank you for everything Take care Missus! Are you taking Hachi? Chizuko says that seeing Hachi Will only remind her of her father I have an uncle in Asakusa I thought I'd ask him to take Hachi in I see... Maybe that's for the best - Hello! - Hello! I took a day off from the office to help with the moving So did I. Let's do it then What shall we do with Father's books? I'll have no use for books on agriculture and cultivation Take it to the used books shop Anyway, come in I was in a dilemma about where to start first Just get rid of anything old I'll clean out his study Kiku, can you help upstairs? We've got a lot of young helpers All strong and spirited So we've got our hands full without any pets But just leave him. I'll do what I can Thank you He eats anything people eat One can never tell what the future holds The professor was the picture of health, yet... Hachi... Be good now Good bye He knows I wonder how Hachi is doing? You're such a worrywart I'm home You're home Didn't you eat yet? Mother scolded me that I should wait for my husband The foreign office keeps unusual hours So next time, please don't wait for me How about a bath? I want dinner first Your grandmother's here to stay, Toru How was Hachi? I left him with my uncle in Asakusa Dinner's ready, so please wash up How old is this house? About 20 years It belonged to a college professor? Yes, an agriculture professor at Imperial University He was world reknown It's so nice and bright with all the windows It's sturdy for an old house And the price is right, don't you think? The missus is a kind lady Will she lower the price any more? Hachi! What's the idea! I thought you were in Asakusa Are you all right? I hate dogs! It belonged to the late professor. His name's Hachi If this dog's going to come around, I won't buy this house! Don't worry' This dog stays with a relative in Asakusa You mean he walked from Asakusa to Shibuya? I guess so. He wouldn't ride a train Don't worry' about this dog Just think about the house If it's right, please buy it Remember though, get rid of the dog! That dog has no personality Never reacts to a thing I say Just turns around and starts to whine He bites off the chain and runs away Well, leave him here again But if he runs away, that's it Set that up next to the bureau And don't scratch it! Hachi! You can't stay here! That felt good! I chopped up the doghouse for firewood Such a fine day... perfect for moving Hachi! Wait! Hachi, I want you to listen well Your master is dead And this house was sold to someone else The new owner can't stand dogs It's dangerous to wander about here He'll chop your head off with his hatchet Hachi... Come to my house then I don't care for dogs myself But we've known each other a long time Let's go, Hachi London, England? Yes, as a first secretary' He'll attend to the new ambassador Are you going too? I'll be returning to my hometown in Wakayama The professor's old home? No... he had no other relatives But my mother still lives I remember... somewhere near the beach, was it? Yes, a whaling town Gee, I'd love to see a live whale spouting water! About Hachi... Are you taking him? Can you take him in? But we have a cat... We'll take care of him You said you didn't want a dog! But Missus can't take Hachi Why not? Hachi was bred in Akita I know that! So what? Akita is a cold place Wakayama is down south... where they catch whales A dog from Akita couldn't adjust to the warm weather I never met a woman who could talk more Kiku, please take care of Hachi I'd be so relieved if you'd agree All right, I will It's my way of repaying the late professor Hachi's gone Where'd he go? Around this time, he's always at the train station... Waiting by the exit Hachi! I'll get your ticket Hachi... Your master's not coming back any more I'm going back to Wakayama I've asked Kiku to take care of you Good bye, Hachi Let's go Hachi... I never thought you'd agree to take Hachi... You hate dogs You're such a fool She has her mother to take care of back home She couldn't take this big thing with her That's true Can't you understand simple human kindness? Is that so? Well, don't brag so much! You're getting senile lately! Fool! How dare you say that to me? What "fool"?! You called me... A 'fool' first...! Dear! What's wrong? Sorry' Hachi... But I can't take you back with me I have to take Sanae here I've cancelled the lease for the house too You can't stay here Hachi... You're strong, so don't lose to those stray dogs You can be the leader of a pack Hachi... Stray dogs run free So be free and live proud Good bye Good bye Take care He must be waiting for his master He doesn't realize that his master's dead Admirable dog He comes every' day at the same time Such a dumb dog You must be hungry' Come... I'll give you something What's the matter, Hachi? Shiro died Poor thing. He's so skinny It's a year now Waiting for a master who won't return Watching him is painful Why wait for someone who won't come? Hachi wants to wait I know that December, 1928 He's here again So? Let him wait But it's useless It's all right Hachi doesn't care Hachi... Enough already. He's not coming back It's raining Come here and have a bite I'm a reporter with Asahi Shimbun "Man's Best Friend" "Dogs waits loyally for a master who won't return" Hachi! I rushed over when I read the newspaper You've been waiting for your master every' day? Look how dirty you are How you must've suffered You're the missus? This dog comes every' day in the evening My husband really loved him... It hurts to see him like this I'm sorry', but we don't have a place for dogs Any corner will do Isn't this the dog that was in the papers? Yes So this is the loyal dog, Hachi? And you are? I knew the late owner, Professor Ueno Well then, I'll let this loyal dog stay the night I hope he doesn't bite though No, he won't Hachi is a good boy Hachi... He was here awhile ago Hachi disappeared from the inn It's been three days now I guess he thought I'd give him away again Hachi wants to stay here Free and unchained I can feel his eyes on me I must be going If Hachi comes, please feed him We can't accept! Please take this All right Bad dog! Coming here again! Take that! Scat! Two Japanese army is still fighting Our team is entering the city - It is really exiting. - I don't want to see this Hachi! You poor thing! Is this the mutt the paper wrote about? He's got a name... It's Hachi Well, he's not waiting for his master He's just a freeloader waiting for food These foul pests should be put to sleep Say mister, you're the one with a foul heart How dare you face a customer and say that! You're no customer of mine! Enough! Take your money! Keep it! Hachi! Eat! Eat all you want! Eat up Poor thing May, 1934 Hachi!
