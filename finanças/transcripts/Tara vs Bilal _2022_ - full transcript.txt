Welcome to the Victoria Hotel. I'm sure you'd be very happy here. Thank you for choosing us. My name is Farzana. If you need anything at all during your stay, just ask. Okay? I'm going to need your name, your signature, and your passport number right here. Thank you. Thank you so much. Here you go. Your room keys. Alright. Excuse me. Yes. You have room? Yes, of course. The price is 80 pounds per night. Breakfast included. You'll have to pay 80 pounds in advance. What?! 80 quids? Yes. That's too much. One minute. The last vacant room has finally been booked. Let's go home, chop-chop! I've informed Vijay we're leaving. Let's go. One of the rooms is still vacant and is blocked by your dear son. He has his own room, right? It's in the next bloody lane. That's his office, Shanno. He cannot practice law sitting at home. What practice? He doesn't have a license. What will he do? Anyways, what has Bilal done in the last ten years, except for splurge money? Okay, fine. Just don't smoke in the kitchen. Please. Thank you. Do you want some water? No, thank you. Should I make some chai? No. Is there any calculation that needs to be done? I can help you with it. You'll never feel the need to use a calculator when I'm around. This belongs to my mother. We'll have to get a thicker chain for this. It's heavy. I'll go pay for the room. Later, I have to go meet the lawyer for Grandpa's visa. It may take a while. Karan! Should we... call up Grandpa once? It's 2:00 a.m. in India. You haven't slept a wink since we got on the plane. Get some rest. We'll talk tomorrow, okay? Grandpa, I swear, you make the best Chai in the world! Don't make excuses. I know what you're doing. Don't try to flatter me. Grandpa, Karan Sharma is the best choice. But, there should be someone who could guarantee that the boy's genuine. But, Grandpa, there is! They are the guarantors. What is wrong with the proposals I got you? Hey, you're doing the same thing again! - Grandpa. - Here, hold this. - I like your tea better. - No, hold it. There are better, eligible boys, and most importantly, we have mutuals. Grandpa, Karan is a Kashmiri. He wants us to move to London with him, and the best part is that we'll be staying together there. So for me, Karan is the best choice. London? How will we manage things there? We will manage. We don't even get tea leaves there. - Grandpa! - What do they call it there? Tea is often made by dipping those things... - Do you mean tea bags? - Yes! One shall see the truth of life And my blessings are with you One shall see the truth of life And my blessings are with you... Hello, Uncle. Hello, darling. How come you're here? - Tara, what are you doing here? - Actually... And what's this? Why haven't you started applying henna yet? Putting on bridal henna takes a lot of time. - Go get ready... - Just a second, Auntie. Uncle, whilst selling the house and getting the money transferred to Karan, I didn't get a chance to thank the two of you. Why thank us, my dear? He's not your grandpa alone. He's ours too. You won't even realize when days go by. Hey, Tara. Get going, dear. - Do you have Gurmeher's number? - I'll be right back. - Yes, I do. - Please give it to her. - Go put on henna. - Yes, of course. Everything is going smoothly. Lord, bless Tara with only happiness. Sorry, the service requested is not available. Karan, please pick up! You've reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. You've reached a number - that has been disconnected... - Karan, please... or is no longer in service. Actually... My husband, Karan Sharma... We checked in tonight. He is fair and has black hair. He was wearing a green jacket. He left five hours ago. Hasn't he returned yet? No, madam. Ma'am, are you okay? You've reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. No reply. Stupid! Never picks up. - Tea. - Thank you. What happened, sister? Room number 216. No one has answered the door in four days, and the room hasn't been cleaned. Good God, sister. What if someone is dead... Did someone die in that room? Oh, God! No one's dead. No, sister. Bodies reek a couple of days after a person dies. Open it. Come on open it. What if someone sees us? You're the older one, sister. So what if I am older? You're pretty handy with the knife in the kitchen. Come on. Open it. About time. Billu, my child. The apple of my eye. You are strong. You are very very strong. Yes, yes. And you must close this key. - Okay, Mom. - Please... - Thanks. - My darling son. Thank you. Sorry madam, I am coming in. How can you just get in here? Get out. I am sorry you'll have to vacate the room immediately. I'll take your suitcase down for you. Please leave! I am sorry. You're the one who'll have to leave. And, I'll need 400 pounds from you. So, the 400 pounds... are you going to make the payment here or downstairs? I am not going anywhere. What if my husband comes back? We've tried his phone, and we've tried his address. It's all bogus. He's not gonna come back, I'm... I'm sorry, he's not coming back. The money... I don't have it. I can call the police. Should I? Go ahead. You won't get your money even if I go to jail, because I don't have any. How will I go back? I gave all my money to him. I sold my house. Please don't throw me out of here. I'm sure my husband will come by! Please! Hey, Mike. How are you? But, I have no place to go. I don't even have an address he could drop me off at. How do you know he won't come back? I know because... this is pretty common. Mike, don't charge her. It's on me. No, thank you. Oh, beloved one from a faraway land Offer him sweet apples What did you do on the way Tell me honestly, O beloved Tell me honestly, O beloved Don't be sad, Tarachand. Chin up. Beloved... Rise above all Daughters have to leave someday Like a bird leaves the nest And rise above all Daughters have to leave someday Like a bird leaves the nest Leaving your mansions And your father's affection behind Leaving your mansions And your father's affection behind And move out with her beloved... Hello. Grandpa. How are you, my child? I've been trying to reach Karan's phone for so long. Didn't he buy you a phone yet? No, he... Listen, my phone has a low balance. So, you keep calling and texting me. Are you okay? I am okay, child. It's just that I miss you a lot. Take care, my monkey. Daughters have to leave someday Like a bird leaves the nest Daughters have to leave someday Like a bird leaves the nest Gurmeher Kaur. She is a good friend of ours. Here, keep this number handy. If you ever feel homesick in London, just call her. Just mention your uncle's name... and she'll be there for you in the blink of an eye. Rise above all Rise above all... - Bye! - Bye! - Hello, doctor. - Shut up! How are you? I am done. Not so friendly doctor. Let me see, what we can do for you. Hey, light it. I see. Give it to me. Give it. How's your Sunday going? Why do our families destroy our Sundays and then tag it as "family time"? Any Gujarati they meet on the streets... is invited over for a free checkup. I am fed up. Fuck, man. - Only one person can fix my mood... - Hey! Stay away from it. Let's go there tomorrow. I really miss being there. You pervert! It's just been three days since you went there. So sad. I am in love, dude. You won't get it. You don't have a heart, bloody loser! Give it here. Just pick me up on time tomorrow night. No excuses. I like how you boss around me. And can't say a word in front of your dad. Get lost. Why don't you have a backseat on this? Because she's a one-man type of girl. I wish she had a one-woman type of man. - Did you get one? - Get lost. - Hey! - Get out. - Get lost. - Get lost. Yeah, get lost! Piggy! I'm coming! Yes? Gurmeher Auntie? Does she live here? No. But... Yes? Gurmeher Auntie? Who's that? What's that? - She lives here? - No, not at all. No, actually, Uncle Balli gave me her address... One second. No, love. You have horrendous taste in clothing, okay? You're ugly. Yes? See, this is house number 12. No, okay. There is no Gurmeher here. You have the wrong address, okay? So, stop banging on my door, take your bags and the ones under your eyes, and leave. Who asked for Gurmeher? - Auntie are you... - I am Gurmeher. Call me, Daisy. Auntie, I just arrived from India. Uncle Balli gave me your address and your number. Balli? Get started with your meal. - I'll be there right after you. - Who is Balli? Get going! I wanna know. How do you know Balli? Uncle Balli and Auntie Sonu gave me your number. They are your best friends from Karnal. Yes. Just a minute. Don't you have patience? Keep the calculations ready. I'll call you back. How is Balli? He is fine. He told me that you own a restaurant. Is it closed? It's closed. It opens only in the evening. I... Actually, Auntie... Uncle Balli told me to call you if I ever felt homesick. He loves me like a father. Yes... - Auntie no! Please, I don't need this. - Keep it. - No, Auntie... - Keep it. Bye. - Bye. Take care. - No, Auntie. Hear me out... Just a minute. Hold on. Save me, Lord. You'll die if you don't tell me, right? How would I know the sum of 561 and 247? That'll be 808. The total would be 808. I had 1100. So you tell me the difference? The difference would be 292. Find out where the 292 quids disappeared and give me a callback. Or, I'll have to deduct it from your pay. Do you understand, you idiot? That was my accountant. He's a total nut. What were you saying, child? Auntie I... I... What did you say your name was? - Tara. - Tara. Quiet everyone! Anybody dare talk about work on this table! She is here to have a meal. Let her eat, then she'll leave. Nobody talks about work. - Zip. - Yeah. But, that's also because Daisy here... - has a secret. - What secret? Daisy here has been naughty. Do you want to get beaten? - Come, Tara. - She's here. Come. Tara, come. Tara. - Hi, girl. - Hey. Hi, Tara. Hi. Sorry. Tara, have your food. Come on, start. - Oh, wow! - Yeah, it's... - Turn your back... - Seriously. You can give it out. Wow! What beautiful bangles, Tara. You know, that means she's a newlywed. You must be really missing Indian food. Babe, be careful. Carbs go straight to your hips. You just got married, right? Careful? Let us tell you a little something about men. - Oh yeah, because you know so much. - Yeah, because you know... The way to get a guy isn't solely through his stomach. I think you get it. You understand. She knows. She looks like a smart girl. Smart girl. So tell us, smart girl, which way is it? Ritz, pass the salad. Salad? No! Tara is not in the mood for salad. What she wants and what she is craving, is something non-veg. She knows that. I'll leave, Auntie. Finish your food. No, I'm done. - Wait, Tara. - She is leaving. - What is wrong with you guys? - She is leaving. Who talks like this? No. Stop it. Tara, wait! Listen to me, dear. Where are you going? Get inside. I don't have anywhere to go, Auntie! This honeymoon has turned into a living hell for me. I spent the night at the bus stop. Even if I tell Grandpa about it, he won't get me. I spent all my money on the wedding, and Karan fled away with my money and jewelry. Stop crying. He left me. I got thrown out of the hotel, Auntie. What will I tell the police? What do I do? Where do I go? I don't understand. Okay. Don't feel awful. Tell me what exactly happened. I found Karan. Too much carbs, too much protein, too much make-up, too much attitude. Son, how do you decipher someone's attitude from the photo? Why don't you try meeting one of them for a change? There is nothing wrong with meeting them. I don't want to meet them. My bride's already parked in the garage. - I see. So, is your bike your bride? - Yes. Okay then. Ask her to do your laundry, iron your clothes, and make her cook high-protein food for you. Because we're not going to anymore. You don't understand, son. You need that sort of a wife. You know, the... homemaker type. We're saying this for your own benefit, son. And anyway, you're not that young anymore. You'll be turning 35 soon. I just turned 32. Oh God! You're almost 40! - When will you get married if not now? - Auntie... Not until you guys keep pandering to his needs. Grandma, can you please explain to me, how these three women with unsuccessful marriages, are forcing me into a marriage? You know what happens when a man in this family comes under pressure, right? There's a possibility of two things happening. Either divorce... or... Well, there goes our happy Sunday. Look, Tara. I just want to help you. Okay? Whatever you see here tonight... or whatever you experience tonight, you won't call anyone in Delhi or tell anyone anything without asking me first. Understood? Yes. But... Auntie! Welcome to Gilassy Bar. Who can reveal your true self to you? And your doings? Your doings... Your doings... Who can reveal your true self to you? I'm here to put A price tag on myself again Let me settle this for once and for all Win the battle today Because my body is like metal Let me settle this for once and for all Win the battle today Because my body is like metal Feels like a masculine night So speak your heart and tell it right Honey don't be shy-shy Or your fate may twist and make you cry Feels like a masculine night So speak your heart and tell it right Honey don't be shy-shy I am going to wring them dry Drop all inhibitions All the hearts beating in here I am going to break them all tonight Only Raja is capable of doing this job A lullaby for my dear kid There's a treat in a bowl for you Savor it quickly What are you waiting for? A lullaby for my dear kid There's a treat in a bowl for you Savor it quickly What are you waiting for? You know I don't like such things, right? Auntie! Is this what you do?! What do you mean by that? All of them are boys... What's up, ladies? Need to pee! Need to pee! They are gays, so? Would it be okay if those were girls dancing with boys instead? Tell me? Look, Tara. We only live once. All we have is one chance... and the right to live our life on our own terms. Looking at the state you're in right now... I thought of helping you out and giving you a place to stay here. Me? Liv, hurry up, girl! We have to go! Coming. Are you for real, Auntie? I would rather die than do any of this. I wanted to hire you as an accountant. You're really good with numbers. Think about it. - Happy birthday to you! - Happy birthday to you! - Happy birthday to you! - You won't wait for Billu. - No! Come on, blow out the candles! - Happy birthday, dear Zoya... Ali... Ali Baba and forty thieves It was a total boys club Trapped inside a cave Playing hide and seek The light in the cave was dim It was dim...

A lullaby for my dear kid There's a treat in a bowl for you Savor it quickly What are you waiting for? I'm here to put A price tag on myself again Jiggy. Jiggy. Jiggy, you pervert! Hi. Okay, this, this is tacky. What is tacky? This. This... Is that how you call someone? I'm sorry. Actually, I wanted to ask you something... Looking for this? - Is that... - Your chain. Please, come on. You guys get going. Come on. I wanted to ask you out for a cup of coffee... - No. - Please? - Come on, leave. - No! - Just one coffee. - I said leave! Jiggy, what's wrong with you? Jiggy, leave. Go home. - America no? - No. Jiggy, okay, you need to go home. Have some water... No! No, Jiggy. We don't beg. One chance. One coffee, please. Please one. Anything. It's all over now. You're lucky... that he's fallen for you. Ritz. Ritz, I'll be back. Just one chance. Just one chance. If you don't mind, can I ask a question? I mind. How will I sleep here? Okay... First, you do this, and then, you do this. Don't you guys feel you're doing something wrong? Doing what, Tara? I am not doing this. This is who I am. Maybe, you'll get it someday. Take my advice and stay. I cannot stay here. Okay, then go. Call an Uber and go to the airport. But do one thing. Treat yourself to a business class ticket. You have the money, right? Look... I know you had a tremendous culture shock today. I can understand what you're feeling. Trust me. I get it, babe. I do. But at least make some money before going back to India. Okay? Now don't cry. You're too pretty to cry, okay? So go to sleep. Now that I've told you how, okay? And, I'll speak to you in the morning. I need my beauty sleep. Because I am a Queen, and deserve to be sleeping like one. Hello, gents. How are you? Oh, you! Alright. Okay. Okay. I get that something's up. I am getting a vibe. So before you guys start... can I get a coffee? All you got to do is press a button. So do it or is that too much for you to do? This boy is the limit. Noor! What? What happened? Sorry? Do you even know what you're apologizing for? How does it matter, Mom? How does it matter? I must have said something or done something. Or wait a minute... it could be something I didn't say or didn't do. So either way, I'll have to say sorry. Because you guys own this show. Brother Bilal, it was Mom's birthday. Shit! Zoya waited for you to come. Mom, why didn't you call me? Did you check your phone? I get so many unnecessary missed calls from you all day. - How would I know? - Of course, because we've nothing better to do than call you all day. Actually, Auntie, you may be onto something there. I feel the same way. How does this fit into this? Bilal, there should be certain occasions, when you give priority to all of us. I am sorry, Auntie Zoya. And happy birthday. Belated. Okay. So, guys, let's all of us go out for dinner. We'll go somewhere posh. I'll wear a suit. Just the way she likes it. Okay, Auntie? No, son. Let it go, Bilal. See? She's right. I agree with her. I think we should not make a fuss about it. Billu, Zoya was really looking forward to it. As if he cares. Guys... Sorry, but can I eat this now? Sorry. Sorry! Sorry! What does he have to give this family except for "sorry"? I couldn't show up, that is the problem. Now that I want to take you guys out, is also a problem. What do you women want? Wait a second. You guys to go out for dinner, right? There you go. Here. That's for you. For you! For you! Dinner's on me tonight. Go knock yourself out! Bilal! There's a limit to being rude. There, look over there. Did you check in here? Move. I'm sure it's somewhere here. Search for it properly. Where are you going, useless? Save me, God. You're staying, right, Tara? I have no other place to go to, Auntie. Don't worry. Don't worry. You'll have a lot of opportunities to run away. I can pay you 1000 pounds every month as a salary. Okay? Tara, could you show me your visa? - Here. - Let me see. Damn! This is a six-month tourist visa. - So? - This won't help, Tara. That rascal didn't even get you a spouse visa. What kind of a guy is he? Well, I'll figure it out. I'll pay you in cash for the first few months, okay? But, I'll have to deduct 100 pounds from it. For work permit, child. - I hope that's okay. - Yeah, that's okay. Okay, fine. Greetings. Good morning. Hello. Coffee? Have we met? No. No? - Yes. - No! Did they not show you a photo of me? No. Well, I've seen one of you. And my name is Niamat. Hi. Hi. You... don't look so good in your photos. You're not that photogenic, are you? Where is Mom? - They are just inside. - Are they? Yeah, they just wanted us to... have a little private chat. And what is this private chat about? You're so wicked. Am I? You know, you and me... getting hitched. My grandson is very handsome. Billu loves food. He loves kebabs. You've not had a samosa. Come on. - When were you going to tell me all this? - Later. I wanna know about it now. We want you to get married, finally. Now, please don't argue with me. - Will you get me married to anyone? - Don't be silly. We took a lot of time to find this proposal. Her? - Who knows you better than us, Billu? - Oh, sure! Please cooperate. Please! Mom, you've lost it! There are guests sitting inside. Please, Bilal. Please. Let's go. Come on. - Let's go. - Okay, come on. Let's go. Billu! Get up. What did I say? - Bilal. - Get up! - Bilal! - Samosas down! - Down! - Bilal. No one's getting hitched here. And a marriage is definitely not happening. Go get your daughter's test drive somewhere else. - Please! - Out! He gets very angry when he's hungry. Billu, have a kebab. - Get up! - How dare you? What's going on, Farzana? We came here because we respect you. Our daughter can find anyone. Then go find anyone! Just get out of here! - Rude. Mannerless! - Yeah! This is too much, Farzana. - Move. - Relax. - Move. - Relax. Come on, just leave! - Out. - Relax. Keep walking. - How dare you? - How dare you?! You are going to get married, that's it. No more arguments. You've all lost your mind. I should get you all checked into a facility. You can't. Because you can't manage without us. I'll be very happy without you guys being around. And if you talk about mine or anyone else's marriage here, - then you just watch out! - What then?! What will you do? Shanno is right. You cannot survive a day without us, Bilal. What? - That's what you think, Auntie. - Yes. That's what you all think? - Yes! - Yes! Try me. All of those idiots fall sick on the same day. Tara, come. I need your help. - But, what... - Come on, the club's packed. - What help? - Just come along. Nothing, you've to just operate the card machine. - Martin will teach you to do it. - I don't know how to... Martin will teach you. We're running out of time. I have no idea how that works... Oh, there she is. Finally. Come on. Do you see those... tables over there with the two gentlemen. What do you want? I hired a new accountant. Delete my number. Rascal. - I don't know how it works. - Just take this. - No... - It's very easy. - Just swipe it. Go! - I don't know how to use it. We don't have time. Why do you keep pushing me all the time? Decline? Excuse me, your card is... That was good. You! Wait a minute. I know you. Yes, even I know you. Yeah, it's from that other day. - A cheapskate owner of a has-been hotel. - What? Who is going to pay these sixty pounds? Wait a second. You're not a dancer. No, I am an accountant. That makes sense. Pay the bill and get lost. - Of course. - Any problem? No, no, I have cash. I have cash. Mr. Karim... No problem. - Change. - Duffer. - I have no change. - Mr. Karim. - He's given me a headache. - Who? - He's been asking for you. - But... - See him for yourself. - Who is it? What do we do about him? Hey, please... I want to meet him just once outside the club. - Please... - Who? Ritz. Please... I've asked him dozens of times, but he turns me down. Please, just once. I know he likes me. I've seen it in his eyes. - Just once... - But will he... - Please convince him... - Hey! Please, ask him to meet me just once. Look, me telling him will make no difference. I've seen him talking to you during every break. Please, don't mind. But, there's nothing I can do. - Mr. Karim. - Tara, please. - Come on, time for you to go home. - Please, just try telling him once. - Careful. Come on. - Tara, please. - You can come back tomorrow. - Please, tell him once. Look, stop insisting on meeting Ritz... Mrs. Karan Sharma. I knew it was you in there. By God, I was a hundred percent sure... that you'd go back to Delhi. But you turned out to be pretty brave. Why do people have this desire, to live abroad? They'd do anything to settle here. I have no desire to stay here! How could I go back to Delhi? You didn't even leave me a penny. That dejhoor belonged to my mother. I told you, right? That was the only memory I had of her. Give it back to me. You extorted all my money. I'll call the police right now. Are you gonna call the police? Okay, what are you gonna tell them? Are you gonna tell them that I'm your husband? What evidence do you have? Your traditional Indian marriage... has no value here. Understood? But what if I end up telling them... that you're here on a tourist visa, and you're working? And when they arrest you, I will send that picture to your grandpa. You wanna stay here, right? You wanna live peacefully? That's gonna cost you then. Do you understand? How can someone hit you so hard? Is he human or an animal? And why did you step out late in the night? It's wrong, right? You should have sent one of them. I thought... I am sorry. What are you being sorry about? What did you do? Thank you, Ritz. This is going to sting a little, okay? Let me apply it, dear. Or it will leave a scar. Auntie? Mom? Grandma? Hello? Auntie? Where are you guys? Noor, Me her? Guys? Room with a view, and all we got is a bloody wall. That's all we can see over there. - And another... - This is not acceptable! We've booked a room. We need keys. Mr. Bilal! Auntie said that you'd look after... Auntie said you'd look after the hotel! Excuse me. I want to speak with the manager... Mom, what's going on? Where is everyone? We're fulfilling your wish, son. What rubbish? We're in Ilford, at Auntie Yashmin's place. Her husband owns a travel agency. - He's arranging a trip for us to India. - What? India? Mom, is Grandma there? Let me talk to her, please. Mom, talk to him. It's Bilal. Tell me. Grandma, what's going on? What about what you guys did? You brought a girl over. And you guys are making a scene over what I said? You were restrained because of us, right? I don't feel restrained! Please, explain this to everyone and bring them back home. Are you ready to get married? Grandma, have you consumed some cheap beer? We'll come back only if you're ready to get married. Otherwise, we're leaving. The house and hotel are both yours. - God bless. Bye, son. - Grandma! Fuck! Darn! Where are we going though? I was feeling really low. So, I thought we'd do something fun. Don't worry, everything will be fine. Think about it. Guys are always told to be someone when they grow up, make a living, support the family, etcetera, etcetera. But, all they tell girls is... to settle down and get married. And I couldn't even do that. Tara, don't worry. We'll make sure your next wedding is a grand affair. Let it be. We'll get you married first. Me? How will I get married? Marry that guy who is always hovering around you. The Jiggy guy. He tucks his t-shirt into his jeans. And, I'll spend half my life just giving him a makeover. See, you want to give him a makeover, right? Look, Jiggy is crazy. He has no reality check in life. Yeah, but there is something about him. I want to believe him. - Shut up. - Listen. Could you just stop by the coffee shop for a second? Tara. Please, just one coffee, Ritz. We're not allowed to meet anyone like this. You're gonna get me killed, Tara. I completely forgot. I had to call Grandpa. Oh, yeah? Shut up and sit tight. I'll be right back. No, here have this. Jiggy! What is he doing here? - Who? - Jiggy, the Khan women have disappeared on me. I need to talk to you right now. You? Oh, God, you? Bilal, fuck off. What did you say? Listen, that is very important, and this can wait. Let's go. - This is very important for me, Bilal. - I think he's trouble. I know, we should leave. Ritesh Shah! Don't you dare move. Sit! Ritesh Shah?! Are you a Gujarati? Yes. Thank God. Thank God! That solves everything? Can you introduce him to your father now? Why are you here? - Please, just get lost. - Jiggy, come with me. - Tara, please take him. - Right now, come on. Please come out with me for a second. - No. - Please, I am talking to him. - One second. - Jiggy... - Come on. - Just get out! - Go! - We just need to talk. Please get out of here. What? Please leave, Jiggy is busy. You leave with your Ritz. And listen, don't give Jiggy false hope. If he gets his heart broken, then you just watch it. A man who can throw a helpless girl out of his hotel for money, is talking about feelings. Don't pour out your frustration on me because of your dishonest husband. I've never seen a rude guy like you in my life, I swear. Then, see one now. Yes, Noor. Any luck? No, Noor, I won't get married. Noor... just go and find out what time their flight is, and call me back asap! Alright? Yes, love. Okay. - Aren't you a little too old for marriage? - What? Just because you had a child marriage, doesn't mean everyone is going to have a child marriage. You got married in your childhood! Look, how well it's turned out for you. - Rude. - Eavesdropper. Only an unfortunate girl will marry you. For fuck's sake I do not want to get married! Then don't! Just marry her and flee away. You look like the type of guy who doesn't care for anyone other than himself. What did you say? Bilal! All the arrangements are in place. And now you're refusing to go to India. I don't want to go anymore, Mr. Tariq. Cancel all the arrangements, and I am so sorry for this trouble. It's not about the trouble, Farzana. The money will go to waste. Can't help it, Mr. Tariq. I am so sorry. What are you doing? - Noor. Me her. - Hurry up. It's all drama. Nothing has happened to him. God knows how badly injured my boy is. - What are you doing? - Come on, all of you. Hurry up and get in. Let's go, Shanno. Find out what hospital he is in. Billu, where did you get hurt, son? Bilal, where are you, son? Bilal. - Bilal. - Stop. My darling son, how are you? That's a huge bandage. You really did get hurt? Guys, I want you all to meet my fiance. Tara. What? Fiance? - Hi. - Fiance? Is it true, Billu? How did this happen? Jiggy. Jiggy. Jiggy, what are you doing? Jiggy! - What is this? - Asshole! I am in a hospital, you're a doctor! You should be treating me. Instead, you're beating me up. - Look at my hand. - You're in my hospital, and you dared to give my nurse an indecent proposal. What? Indecent proposal? I was talking about marrying her. What is indecent about that? You were talking about a fake marriage, right? I am talking about pretend. I'm ready to pay them. - Pay for what, love? - Oh God! It's not a joke. It's the real thing. Then teach me the real thing. - Hey! - Get off. - He's so stupid. - I was ready to pay for that. How on earth did you grow up with him? - Let's beat him black and blue. - Jiggy! How can you not understand? How much? How much are you ready to pay? Why haven't you told us about her before? And now, you two have decided to get married? I don't believe it. Don't get involved in his problems, Tara. Bilal is very complicated, Tara. His family is very overprotective. If they call your bluff... You know that 15,000 pounds are around 1,5 million rupees, right? You guys don't understand how desperately I need this money. But, I do. Do you understand? You got to drive my family nuts. Then, we'll have a proper wedding. And on the day of the wedding... Think about it again, Tara. I really thought about it before saying yes. Marrying Bilal will change my life forever. No, this makes no sense. Give me one too. - You don't mind, baby? - No. You said your family is pretty cool, right? I have only ten days left. Let me enjoy it. What? Ten days?! Yes, Tara's promised me. She will quit smoking on our wedding day. - Whose wedding are you talking about? - Our wedding? - Huh? - What's "Huh"? Tara and I are getting married in ten days. How? How can someone get married in just ten days? Bilal, you're a compulsive liar. - This is very sudden. - Very! Billu dear, just tell us, how can one get married in ten days? Stop. All of you. All you guys wanted was for me to get married, right? So Tara and I are getting married in ten days. - Something is up... - How? - They will look good together. - How is this possible? - Please agree for the marriage. - I'm not stopping them. We must find out who her parents are. What do you mean by good-looking? At least, he's ready for marriage. Bilal, swear on me. Grandma, don't be silly. Swear on me. Come on, Grandma. You're making him nervous. You know how he is. Come on. We have got a wedding coming up. A lot of arrangements have to be made. God bless. Come here. Wow! Welcome to the family. God bless you. Congratulations, my son. Congratulation to you. Noor. Me her. Congratulations. Well done. - Both of you. - Cheers. I, Bilal Khan, 203 Edgwave road London, agree to pay Tara Kaul... B-304, flat, Moti Nagar, Sector 8, New Delhi, a sum of 15,000 pounds. What is this? Hello, this is my entire life for me. Everything I have is on this agreement. This is my fund for going back and restarting my life with Grandpa. To buy a big house in London, we sold the little house we had in Delhi, and gave all the money to Karan. That's not all. I was wearing dejhoors. Dejhoor? The Kashmiri earrings. It was the last thing I had of my mother. They were tied with strings. Because the chain of the dejhoor is provided by the groom's family. Sweet! He snipped off the strings and stole my dejhoors as well. Rascal. Thank you. So, you were saying that you found this guy on a website. Just sign it! How is this going to help you? This is just a piece of paper. How do you know? I am a lawyer. A lawyer? Wait a second... Hey, one second. You're a lawyer? Yes. - I failed to pass the bar. - What? I mean... I don't have a license to practice law. But, you're a full-fledged lawyer? A full-fledged lawyer. - Then? - Then what? - Don't you want to get a job? - Why should I? - Why not? - Why? Focus on your job, Tara. - This? - Yes. This is not a job. Do you know what I always wanted to be? - What? - Professor. A Math Professor. How can anyone be so boring? - You know... - Hello, college professors get free housing on campuses. - What? - What? What's so funny? Nothing. You're amazing, Tara. Give me the paper and the pen quickly. Come on. - I've got a pen. - Yeah, of course. Right. If my grandpa finds out I smoked... No, Auntie, I mean... even I need security, right? Security from what? I'll feel better if I can take a look at the property papers. What do you want to see in the property papers, child? I just want to make sure everything's in Bilal's name. Obviously, who else would it be? No, Auntie. Actually, Bilal was telling me that Aunt Zoya manages all the paperwork. After all, even she has two daughters. So? What does that mean? She means, did you go behind our backs and put the name of your daughters in the will and property papers? Right, Tara? Right, Auntie. Noor! Me her! Take me away from here! You've ruined my reputation in front of your family. That's the idea, Tara. Jiggy, that's not how it's done. Try to understand. The way we are right now is fine. You always think about tomorrow. Bloody Gujju. Why not? Why can't we get married? I have a question. They'll be shocked if I run away from the wedding, - right? - Yes. Then what are you gaining from this odd behavior and hurting their sentiments? They are old folks. You should have shown some respect. They are old, respectable, and rich, that's why I'm giving them the opportunity to reject our wedding every day... to maintain peace within the family... and to protect our reputation. They get a chance every day. So, how will your dad face his gujju siblings? My dad... Ritz, I agree that my dad loves his worldly reputation. But eventually, I think he loves me more. No, not like that. Do you know how much he spent on my medical school? He won't disown me so easily. Don't worry. We have some hope. I just hope they are smart, realize things while they have the time and say no before the wedding. Or I don't mind them becoming a laughingstock at my wedding. By the way, where are all the husbands in this family? Don't ask. It's a train wreck. And your father? He's no more. I am sorry. It's okay. When did he... I was 13. - Bilal... - Stop! Enough. Ask the right questions, Tara. Focus on my mom, my aunts and my grandma. Get to know them better, Tara. Focus, yeah? All good. Ritz, thank you so much for the ride. You can pull up right here. See you tomorrow at the pub. Ritz. Not discussing the matter doesn't mean it's over. Bilal. It's okay. I don't have both my parents either. Shall we go? They aren't even married yet, and she's already demanding a share in the property. That's what your son chose. Let them get married. If they don't get along, he will leave her. That's what our husbands did too. Come on, Shanno... Him getting married is important to us. But, is knowing who he's getting married to also important? Yes, it should be. Hello, gents. How are you? It's a good thing you're here, Bilal. Give us your guest list. We're getting the wedding cards printed. By the way, Billu, do you want a sit-down dinner or a buffet? Let me think. Let's get... everything! Why not? Come on, Tara. Light this fire. Auntie, I was thinking, you must be getting a hefty alimony because of Me her and Noor. And you too. Why did you get divorced? Smoking? My husband used to hit me! Not only did I get hit, but also slapped with a divorce. That's a good thing. He must be paying a pretty hefty alimony to you. What is alimony? Grandma, post the divorce, husbands pay for the wife's monthly expenses. None of us had that luxury in this family. I guess you never asked for it. Shanno, get me the list of caterers. I heard that girls in London get a prenup before the wedding. Prenup for what? Alimony. What are you suggesting? We should give it in writing too? Yes. You're getting furious, Auntie. I was just making conversation. We all understand what you mean. Relax, Auntie. Relax. - Enough. - What's wrong? We're planning the wedding. Say something positive, okay? Come on. It'll be 45 pounds per plate. How much will it cost for 300 guests? That'll be 13,500 pounds. God! All that expense only on food? Yes. So what? You know what, Auntie? Let's have a small function. It's all gonna go to waste anyways. Tara! Why did you have to blabber? I wanted a big wedding. Big drama. No more wedding pressure after that! That was the plan. At least, look at me when I'm talking to you. They were spending 35,000 pounds, Bilal. - So? - So? It's all gonna go to waste. Oh, God. But, they were slightly impressed by me. At least now they know I am not completely money-minded. You weren't supposed to impress them. Why are you so needy? What do you gain by making people happy? It's a warm feeling, Bilal. You should try it sometime. Oh, God. Guys, I have an awesome plan to piss the Khan women off. Get her pregnant. Come on, Jiggy. - Idiot! - Sorry. Actually, you may be on to something there. There is one thing my family cannot handle even after staying in London all these years. I am dead sure. Pick one. Pick it up. Hey, pervert! This is not your bedroom. You guys just go on anywhere you want to. Come fast. Disgusting! God saves this evil. It's just a kiss, Mom. You're so old-fashioned. Shut up. Quick one! Nothing elaborate. Excellent. Excellent. - Outstanding... - Do you want a smack? - Tara, what are you doing? - Don't you dare... Don't you dare take advantage of my vulnerability. - Don't even think about it. - Tara, are you crazy?! Tara, keep this down. This is London, please. It's not for real, it's just a... Name one thing that's real in your life. I see. Really? Fine, nothing is real in my life. But... the money you're being paid to do this stuff is real. - Shall we? Cheers. - Cheers. Hey! Mrs. Karan Sharma. I see you're shopping a lot. Where are you going? Tara. Tara. Tara, wait. Tara, wait! Daniel Ricardo is the best driver. Waste your case... - It's not about waste your case... - Please, the engine gives the power. - You know, Daniel Ricardo... - Hey! I guess, she's agreed. Yes, Tara. Bilal, help! I am at the station. Karan is following me. Karan? Karan, who? What happened? Tara! - Tara? - Tara! - Shit! - Bilal! - Jiggy. - Bilal! Chuck it! Leave me. Dad! Bilal! - Tara! - Bilal... Bilal! Excellent, Mrs. Karan Sharma. I see you've settled down in London. No... - Give me 500 pounds, quick. - I don't have the money. You don't? Then how are you shopping? Who is paying for it? Please! Bilal. Hey! Mind your own business. She is my wife. Go on. Let's see until when he's gonna protect you. No, Bilal... Don't... - Please, let's get out of here. - Wait. Let's go. Bilal! You son of a bitch! I'll always protect her. I'll do it till the time I'm around. Bilal. Bilal. Just go. Go, Tara. - Jiggy. - Yes. Call a cab and take her home. - Go. - He is fine. - You're my champ, you're okay? - Yes... - Yeah. - You okay? Yes. Thank you. Fuck! Go home, I'll be right behind you. Okay. Come soon. Yes. And... thank you for these. Bilal, my son. Son, your dad forgot the house keys. Go give it to him. Dad. Dad! Dad. Dad! Uncle jumped right in front of his eyes. But why? The business was falling apart. Besides Grandma and Bilal's mom, he had taken on the responsibility of the aunts as well. But, all of these women have amazing business sense. I guess he never thought of it that way. He took up all the pressure himself. Look at Bilal's luck. He was right there when it happened. How can anyone ever recover from that? And now, his mom and his aunts have become his shield. He never felt the need to do something or achieve anything in life. So this is what you do in school? This is what we send you to school for, Bilal? This is unacceptable. We've been best friends since the age of 13. And yet Bilal has talked to me about it only once. I would often ask him when we were kids, but he would ride off on his bicycle. And now? He's the same. Vroom... vroom... He's just gone. His escape route has been clear... always. But sometimes, you can see the state of his heart in his eyes. Auntie, careful! You asshole! Don't you know how to drive, bloody bastard! Tara! My daughters are here. Watch your mouth! What are you two listening to? Close your ears. My reputation has gone down the drain. Please, Bilal, no. We've already done so much. You've done so much, so one more won't hurt, Tara. And remember, a deal is a deal. If I had known this is what I'll have to do, I would've never agreed. Oh, really? Why? Is it because you've so many other options? Hey! If this was Delhi, I would've given you a beating. Oh, yeah. Billu, there's chicken chili. Come on. Coming. Come on, Tara. It's just a stupid kiss, Tara. It's all so overrated. When we leave, before I get into the car. Let's come up with a code word. A code word? As soon as you hear me say it, kiss me. Tara? This tastes nice. "Shall we". What? The code word is... "Shall we." What did you say? Yes, he's here. It's good he's here on time. - Come. - Very good. Please open the door. Tara, how will you go home? Actually... She'll walk home. She's going over to a friend's house. No, we'll drop her. - Get in, dear. - Come. No need, I'll manage. Yeah, she'll manage. She will walk. Tara, shall we? - We'll drop you, it's no problem. - Yeah. No, Auntie. She's okay. Tara shall we? It's not safe to walk home alone. - Absolutely. - Tara, shall we? Oh, God! Excuse me. Noor! Me her! You guys are shameless! It's her fault. She forced me to go and meet Jiggy. Ask her. Liar. I didn't do anything. I only introduced the two. After that... One second, who are you calling a liar? Ritz, calm down. Calm down. Why should I calm down? - I swear I didn't do anything. - What am I saying that's wrong? It was all her fault. Was it not her fault? Enough! Enough! Quiet. This is my club... not a pickup joint. You can just trot in here. These kids are my pride. They are my responsibility. I love them. I know, Auntie. Ritz values that. Does he value it? Is this how you value it? You were fooling around behind my back with him. I wasn't fooling around. I love Jiggy. And I love Ritz, Daisy Auntie. And he keeps pestering me to marry him. But, I don't want to. Why? Why don't you want to get married? Ritz, only the lucky few fall in love. Learn to value it, child. Back in college, a guy was in love with me. Balli. He tried to convince me. He asked me to stay. "Don't go to London. Don't go for my sake". But I had a lot of responsibilities. Now that I think about it, I feel I should have stayed back. I would have handled the responsibilities. I could've managed everything. I lost out on love. Got left alone. With these idiots. Ritz. Get married. How can we get married, Auntie? Save me, Lord. We live in England. I will get you two married grandly. Okay? With this... Get up. Next time, come back only when you bring your father along to fix the wedding date. Got it. Leave. Get going. Okay. Listen. Let your father know that we will split the expenses equally. Why are you standing there all alone? Come here. But Billu, you mean to say she's already married? Well yes, but not technically. Technically? His husband is a thug. He's committed murders. She is very afraid of him. I think we should all help her. Yes, we'll help her. Let's give her 10,000 pounds and get it over with this matter. - Really? 10,000 pounds? - What? But why should we give it? That's her past life, child. We can't be sure if her husband will come back asking for more money. We don't know, Auntie. We don't. But we'll have to manage. I am marrying her. No, no, I am sorry. That's absolutely crazy. Bilal, think about it again. Are you getting yourself married to a girl or some trouble? Yes. Then should I not marry her? No, Billu, we're not denying you from marrying her. We just want you to think about it. - You're right. - Yes. Look Billu, she is very money-minded. And she's a smoker. I am not going to have kids now. She doesn't have manners either. If she had a family around her, she would have had some manners. That's a bit too much, isn't it, Grandma? Why? Billu, everyone is right. No one is right, Mom. - You guys are wrong and mean! - Mean? You guys have become prone to finding faults in everyone. You don't see the good in anyone. She is independent just like you are, Mom. Grandma, she is fun-loving just the way you are. I love chilling with her. And she knows about divorce alimony because she's been cheated on once in her life. Bilal! He's here. He's here. Bilal. It was a terrible idea. Why did you call that thug here? Please, don't say anything. Just agree with everything he says. He's insane. The last time I saw him he hit me pretty hard. - Bilal. - Yes. He won't agree so easily. He'll keep troubling us over and over again. Karan! Sit. But wasn't he... I mean he... Wasn't he taller? No, Auntie. That's Karan. And he looked healthier. No, that's him. That's him. She... is my wife. I see. Then why did you abandon her? It's none of your business. The two of them... cannot get married. So, 10,000 pounds. Okay. Right now. Child, get your checkbook and end this trouble once and for all. I'll need cash. Cash? I don't think we have such a huge amount right now. You own such a huge hotel. You're wearing a toosh. And you're saying you can't give me 10,000 in cash? What sad acts! Billu. Check if we have some cash. And, if there's no cash at home, withdraw it from the ATM and give it to him. And yes, quickly. The red veil... My red veil fluttered with the breeze My red veil fluttered with the breeze My beloved got a glimpse of me secretly I know he'll give me his heart But he'll take my life I know he'll give me his heart But he'll take my life... Thank you. You know... I love toosh. - It's banned now, you know. - Yeah. So naughty you are, Auntie. Cash. Would you like it here or... -My red veil fluttered with the breeze -Ritz, I will fucking kill you. Wait! - Ritz. - Bilal! Beloved got a glimpse of me secretly I know he'll give me his heart - But he'll take my life... - Fuck! I gonna fucking kill you! What the fuck is toosh? The shawl that Auntie had wrapped around her was Shahtoosh. - So? - So, it's made of very high-quality wool. Ritz couldn't control himself when he saw it. He started asking if he could touch it once. And that's where everything went wrong. Why didn't you take charge, Tara? - What could I do, Bilal? - What do you mean? You have a sharp mind in maths, why can't you apply it in life as well? Yes. I can't apply the same in life. I am trying so hard! Can't you see it? Damn! Why are you crying, Tara? Because your plan worked. They hate me. Do you know what Auntie said about me? She praised Karan by saying, "He is such a nice guy, how could I leave him"? Then she said, "He left you". That made sense to them I hate being this girl. You did so well, Tara. You were so good at being bad. What did I achieve doing good? At least, I made some money out of being bad. Exactly. Money is very important in life. What about love, care, family and happiness? Isn't that important? No, no... Absolutely not. No way. No way. Wait a second. It's not important, Tara. It's not important. A man cannot live without money. They'd rather die without it. Do you think your father committed suicide because of money issues? No, Bilal. Jiggy, told me this the night you saved me from Karan. - Jiggy, you bastard! - Bilal! - I don't want to talk about it. - Maybe he couldn't offload his burden. He couldn't share what he was going through with anyone. Just like you can't. You feel the same feel. What rubbish, Tara? What rubbish! Apply this psychology to yourself. Clearly, your grandpa is a very strong and sorted man. And you're doing this instead of calling him and informing him. As if he'll worry about you less when he gets the money, or he'll be less shocked when he learns Karan turned out to be a fraud. I am such an idiot. What was I thinking? Karan's reality will always haunt me. I don't know why Jiggy told you this. Bilal... what you saw that day... there can be nothing worse than that. You're seriously damaged. You're no exception. That's our wedding card. Can I keep it? Of course. It's our wedding card. And you're invited. Please be there. Okay then. See you in two days. Are we gonna meet directly at the wedding? - Tara. - Yes? I'm gonna look handsome in the wedding suit. Don't change your mind. Bilal Khan, when I make a run for it... you'll be shocked. Since I lost my heart to you Time has stopped for me Why does the moon And stars shine so bright? Like your face is the moon itself Covered in a veil of clouds That is a paradise for me Where there is love and God Let's buy ourselves an abode You're my love, you're my blessing Always stay by my side I shall love you Dedicate all my life to you I know, dear. Mothers give the dejhoor. And the mother-in-law gives the chain. So take the dejhoor from me. And the chain from your auntie. You have your mother and mother-in-law in the same house. Welcome to the family. You're my blessing Always stay by my side Bilal, Tara and you are tying the knot of marriage today. Marriage is a divine partnership. Do you accept this alliance? I do. Tara, do you accept this alliance? I do. I've never seen you like this The way I'm witnessing you today I swear on you, I am incomplete Complete me today I shall love you Dedicate all my life to you I will keep chanting only your name Celebrate every time you smile You're my love, you're my blessing Always stay by my side You're my love, you're my blessing Always stay by my side Tara, you didn't... Does that mean we both are... Bilal, when I disappear tomorrow, that's when your family will be shocked. Now your plan's a success, right? Here you go. Your money and the ticket. Thank you. That's a lot of money. Didn't anyone ask you why you needed such a huge amount? - Not even Grandma? - It's none of your business! You got your money, right? Your life-changing amount. By the way, - how did you manage all this? - What? The marriage? I mean, my name surname... I didn't tell them your surname. I told them you're an orphan. It's the truth though. You are an orphan. What will you tell everyone in the morning... That's my lookout. Your job's done. Why do you have to be so rude? What's rude? - You can be gentle. - I am being gentle. I'll leave a letter behind. Write. Bilal, you're a loser. I can't do this anymore. I am sorry. Why do I write "loser"? I thought I'd be done with these marriage hassles once and for all. Tara would walk out on me in front of everyone. There would be drama. You guys would think I am heartbroken and you guys will be finally off my back. What is he saying? Just wait and let me find the thing. That's why I hired Tara. Bilal, you don't have an ounce of shame. Idiot. She wanted 15,000 pounds. I gave it to her. She took it. She left. She is gone now. Found it. We had no clue that we bothered you this much. Bothering me? We were leaving for India. It was better that way. Oh God! It isn't better that way, guys. Do you guys know, why I ride my bike fast and loud at the speed of 125 miles per hour? Because, that speed and that sound, help me drown the screams of my childhood. Dad! The 13-year-old Bilal stops screaming "Dad" for once. Dad! I feel like I just want to keep riding my bike, and never... But then I stop. I stop because... because... I am the only guy in your lives... who didn't take off. Who didn't take off under pressure, no? There should be at least one guy in Noor and Meher's life, who they can look at and say "Every guy just walks away. They will eventually leave". I come back because I... because I... understand you all. I know you guys. And I actually care for you guys... the way you guys care for me, and... I won't go anywhere. I won't go anywhere. I'll stay here. And that's why I lie to all of you. Every day. You lie to us so many times, lying one more time doesn't matter. What are you so guilty about? I am sorry, Mom. Jiggy! - Bilal. - Wait! - Bilal. - Wait a second. - Jiggy, you knew about this? - Know about what? - Let me speak to Bilal. - Wait, Jiggy! - Please... - Answer me. - Did you know about this? - Just a second. Let me speak to Bilal. Knew about? - You knew about this, Jiggy. - He did. - Bilal, you told them. - Jiggy. Yes, he told us! Who gave you a doctor's degree? An idiot like you is rare to find. Just a second, let me talk to Bilal. - Just give me one second. - No, please. Stay down here. - Auntie... - He can hear it, Jiggy. Ask him about Tara. - I need to speak to him... - Ask him about Tara. Bilal, are you okay? Yes. Are you sure? Bilal, if you never get to meet Tara ever again, are you okay with that? Yes. Are you sure? - Just... - I need to see him... Yes. Fine, she is going back to India. What? Oh God! Today, like right now. She is on the way to the airport right now. Bilal. He has come. - Come on! - Come on! - Come on fast. - Go! - Come on. - Let's go. - I've got the car key. - We're also coming. Come on. Noor, Me her, hurry up! I am crazy about you I am crazy about you I hate London traffic. I am going to look for the fastest route on the map. Maps are a scam. I know the way. Really? Do you remember the fastest route from here to South Hall? - Yes. - By heart? Let's follow the map, Shanno, please. - Oh crap, it says an hour and thirty-six... - Language. Maybe we should go straight to Heathrow. Good God. Airport. What if I've to go to the bathroom on the way? Mom, hold on. Shanno, I'll take Mom and Bilal to South Hall in an Uber. You take Zoya and the kids and Jiggy to Heathrow. - Absolutely rubbish! - That's a perfect plan, guys. - You can take the next lane. - I think this one's the best. No one listens to me. Please, don't be difficult. Auntie. Take me to the... train station. Billu darling... Would you be able to go by train? It's an hour and fifty-nine minutes drive now. Auntie... the station. Please. What are you doing? What are you doing, Bilal? Bilal! Dad, I am tired. Take this load off your shoulders. Don't be like your father... be like your mom. Yes, Dad. It's okay, Mom. I'll be fine. It's not your fault. Thank you. It's not. Bilal, we'll come along too. Just let me find parking. Ten minutes, okay. No, Auntie. We don't have so much time. I'll try the club, you guys go to Heathrow. You can do this, right? - You can. - God bless you, son. Billu, return only when you get victory. Bilal Khan, no excuses. Don't come back without Tara. Put a black spot To ward off the evil eye Come, my dear I want to adorn you wholeheartedly The way you adorned wholeheartedly The way you adorned wholeheartedly I am crazy about you You were scared to tell your grandpa that Karan cheated you out of your money. How will you tell him this? Is this worth telling him, Auntie? One husband abandoned me without a word... and the other told me before he did. Ritz. Come here. This is for you. Wear it when you and Jiggy get married. Return this money back to Bilal. You know right? He sold his bike to give you this money. Did he sell his bike? Yeah. Jiggy told me. When you're back in Delhi, don't forget you have a home here too. I won't. I am crazy about you I am crazy about you Without you, I feel no need to live Now that we're apart, nothing is important If you leave now, I won't sleep at night What about the vows I took Tell me you are mine Let me live You come and hold me For the sake of my love... Let me call you a cab. I returned the cash to Ritz. And please, buy your bike back. And, I'll return the money for the ticket once I reach Delhi. Doesn't matter. You've already missed the flight. I had the time changed. I am not that stupid. Did you tell your mom about the dejhoor? Thank you. I liked it. Me too. I've come to get you back, Tara. Tara, as much as you love yourself, a tad more... is how much I have started to love you. I cannot live without... your annoying optimism. And this annoying obsession of yours... to keep everyone happy... I want my name to be on the top of the list. And I promise you, I'll make sure, Tara... that I deserve that position. I'll do everything. Bilal... do you know how long have you been in the number one position? Since the day at the subway. Bilal, what you did for me that day, was very difficult. For my safety, you... Why didn't you ever tell me, Tara? Why didn't I tell you? Because... because you're so reserved. You never show your true feelings. I had to understand everything about you. For the first time, you've expressed your real feelings. That's true. You're right. Then let me openly express my feelings. Don't go. Stay with me. We'll bring Grandpa here. Imagine. The Khan women and one Kaul sir. Yeah? Tara? Yes. Shall we?
