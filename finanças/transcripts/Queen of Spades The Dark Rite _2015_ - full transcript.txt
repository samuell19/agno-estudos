Listen. This dude summoned her in his bathroom. First he heard the steps... Then the squeaking of scissors. Then a woman in black appeared in the mirror. And then? At first nothing. And then as he looked in the mirror, he sort of saw her there. She started cutting his hair, bringing him bad luck... The guy started losing it. When he told people the story, everybody laughed at him. His folks even sent him to the loony bin. And in the end, he simply jumped out of the window. Some weird shit. So? How do you summon her? You get some lipstick, draw a door on the mirror, a staircase that leads to the door, light a candle and say three times: "Queen of Spades, show yourself!" Anya! Let's try it, huh? No. I'm out. No. I'm out. You're the bravest one. Come on, draw it. Come on! We had a deal. I won't. Chicken, are you? Queen of Spades, show yourself! Speak up! Queen of Spades, show yourself! Queen of Spades, show yourself! What is it? Guys, I think I heard something. Come out, kiddo, we gotta talk. Come in, Mom is at work. I woke up at night and heard some rustling. There's a mirror in front of my bed. I looked at it and she was there. You're kidding me. Remember Katya said she can cut your hair? Yeah... Wait a second. Matvey, would you like some tea? Anton! Your ex is calling. Anton! This crazy woman won't stop. Marina? I'm busy. Anton, can you come over? I'll call you next week. The thing is Anya... What? What's the matter with her? Hey Ivan! Can you tell me what's wrong with her? Andrey, I'll take the Swedish one. Don't you wanna help me? Tax deadline is tomorrow. Fine, I'll be back in an hour. Gotta change the generator there. I'll do it when I'm back. It will be the death of me. It's Matvey, our neighbor. He died yesterday. He was 17. Why? A heart attack... He felt unwell, right here at our place. Anya called the ambulance. I was at work. I woke up at night and she was there sitting up in bed mumbling something. I asked her what was wrong. She said she had had a dream of a woman who came and started cutting her hair. Marina, did I get off work to learn that Anya had a dream? And this teapot yesterday... She said she could see that woman's reflection there. And she meant it. She covered it with a towel. What do you want me to do? Why are you here? How are you? Mom said you saw somebody in the teapot yesterday, right? I told you not to call me. Messages only. It's important. She won't give up. Tell me what to do. I've told you everything. Please, come on! Ok. Do you have a radio set at home? Anton! Are you leaving just like that? What else can I do? Don't you see what's happening to her? Marina, I have no time to develop her imagination. I'll check on you next week. Hello? Where the hell are you? - Anton, I need your help. - On my way. It's your company too! Oh, come on. Having trouble? Are you like Anya's dad? Are you like her friend? I'm Katya, your neighbor. Let's go put a bandage on your hand. Andrey, when are the clients coming? Come on, the car will be ready in the morning. Where are your parents? I live with my aunt. How did you know I was Anya's dad? Lucky guess. Tell me... You don't remember me, do you? I used to be Anya's babysitter when she was little. Did you really leave them for a mistress? How old are you? Old enough not to get you busted. Who is it that you all see in the mirrors? She won't be back until tomorrow. Hi. Can I come in? Take off your boots. I've got an idea, see? I wrote this guy on Facebook. He's like a real pro. Seryozha, this is Anya's old man. - Hello. - Hi. Who's this pro of yours? He's in the loop. This guy said we've got to ask her what she wants. I didn't tell him about Matvey, or he would have legged it. Erm... You see, we believe that it was the Queen of Spades who killed Matvey. Right. Guys, you should write some fiction. You've got the imagination for it. I got her on video. I can show it to you if you don't believe us. Do it then! Why are you hiding her? Is she here? Can you see her? Seryozha, are you nuts? Anton, you aren't at home. Marina! Anya! What are you doing there? Wow! A boyfriend's present? I'm twelve, I don't have one. How did you come in? The door was open. Tough cookie, are you? Mom must have forgotten to close it. Why are you back? I decided to stay and give you some father's guidance. Where is she? She's on duty today. Dinner's in the kitchen, heat it up. I'm not hungry. Come on. You'll help me. Come on! Eat some. - I don't want to. - Eat. When are you leaving? Tomorrow. It's Matvey's funeral tomorrow. Will you come? We'll see. You know how it is sometimes? You get some idea and it sticks. It's just that there was this coincidence and the boy died... Dad. I'm ok. Anya, I talked to your friends today. Who asked you to interfere? Dad, stay away! Take your conversations to Mom. Anya! Your friends are morons. Is there nobody normal around? Why are you awake? Get out of there, now. Anya, what are you doing there? She's here. She's cutting my hair. Dad, don't go there! It's not me! Why are you awake? You were screaming bloody murder. It was just a bad dream. Go to bed. Anya, if you don't want to go, it's alright. No. Let's go. You go, I'll wait here. Anybody? The door won't open! What's the matter, man? I'm ok. What's wrong? No, I'm really fine. Give me your hand. Don't be afraid. I'm a doctor. - You're shaking. - It's the funeral, I'm not used to it. This boy's funeral? A heart attack at 17. Huge myocardial scarring! Poor guy. What does it mean? Congenital malformation, that's what. Nothing unusual then? What do you mean? No, I just thought... Come on. Come on, follow me. I took some photos for the report. What's this? Was it photoshopped? I thought it was some defect and took another photo. What could it be? I don't know. Girls, are you hungry? I can't even look at food after the funeral. Seryozha, wait. You go, we need a minute. Let's talk. It's ok. You wanted to show me some video. Right... Queen of Spades, show yourself. Queen of Spades, show yourself. Queen of Spades, show yourself. Guys, I think I heard something. Are you dumb? Scared the hell out of you! Get over here! You wanted to mess with Anya, right? Why mess with her? We wanted to play a trick. I didn't get it at first. Then I came home, watched it in slow motion and... here it goes. Here. What the hell? What is this for? We can talk to her. Ask her questions or something. Do you think she's going to answer? We should ask her "yes" or "no? questions. Guys, cut it out, get it out of your heads. Wait. Let them try. Why are you letting them? They'll get all worked up. You wanted me to take part, didn't you? Either take charge yourself or don't stand in my way. Ok! Each of us has to give one thing of theirs. Cause that's what I was told. Queen of Spades, show yourself. Come on. Queen of Spades, show yourself. Queen of Spades, show yourself. Queen of Spades, show yourself. Maybe we should join hands? - Hey there! Cut it out. - Wait. It's ok. What do you want? "Yes" or "no". You idiot. Are you haunting us? Do you want all of us? Just one of us... Katya? Some stupid game. Where's the other walkie-talkie? There is no other one. Was it all your trick? Where's the second one? Anya, let's go. You think it's funny, huh? Where's the walkie-talkie? What are you doing? We don't have a second one. Seryozha, are you coming? - Katya, your bracelet. - Hello? Where the hell are you? The client's here, the car isn't. - I don't know what to tell him. - The car's broken. He's gonna report a car theft and call the cops. - We don't need any problems. - Tell him I'm on my way. Are you going or staying? You forgot your dumb pad! - Cover the mirrors, they make her stronger. - Will she disappear if we remove them? She'll get less active. Don't make her angry. She can be very dangerous. I told you, didn't I? You shouldn't make friends with them. That's it. Got it? Dad, don't leave. Why so sad? Come on! There, there. Go home. Mom, are you home? Mom? Mom - Hello? - Seryozha is dead. Seryozha is dead... Anton! Anton, hello? Anton! Talk to me! - Yes. - Is she alright? She's scared. I'm on my way. Get your things, we're going to my place. Where are you going? Get into the car, I'll be back in a minute. We're leaving, come with us. I can't. My aunt will be back soon. Wait. Here, you can still join us later. I would have tidied up if I had known. We are reasonable people, we know it can't be like this... Anton. I'm scared. Why did the children die? Drink it. What is it? Go to bed, I'll take the sofa. Anya. Mom is asleep. You can lie next to her. We were just married here. And here you have already been born. The day you were born it was coming down so hard that I couldn't get to the hospital. There were all these car crashes, I was soaked through trying to get a lift on the highway. It was already dark. Nobody wanted to give me a ride. Tough luck. How did you get there? I didn't. I came in the morning and your Mom showed you to me in the window. Why did you leave us for her? You'll get it when you grow up. What will happen to us? We'll be alright. I'll think of something. - Anya! - She's here! She's here! What is it? What's the matter? Hush! Hush! Hush, honey. Anya, hush! What is it? - It's ok. Just a bad dream. - Hush, my little girl. Hush. - Are you there? - What's the matter? You can make a video-call. Can he hear me? Yeah, I can. She's here. How do we get rid of her? I have already told Seryozha even more than I should have. Maybe you can come to us to take a look? Or we can come to you? No, you can't do it. People are dying. Children. Seryozha never said that somebody had died. Seryozha is dead. Sorry, I can't help you. Do you know where he lives? We can get his geolocation. I'm Smirnov. I'm sorry, I thought you were a burglar. Why are you so stubborn? I told you to stay away, didn't I? Shell stick to me too now. Tell me how can we get rid of her. Well, you can't. There are some words you mustn't say in front of a mirror. This is Lola. A very clever creature. Listen. It was the end of the 19th century. An old spinster, a broke aristocrat opens an orphanage. It wasn't about mercy, she received an allowance for the children. After she got the money, she murdered the kids, drowning them in the bathtub. But before drowning them, she sang them a lullaby... Do you recognize it? She killed 19 children. When the people found out, they caught her, beat her up, cut off her tongue, shaved her head, and buried her alive. That's how it all started. A shaved woman in black was first mentioned at the beginning of the 20th century. Due to her ragged black dress people called her the Queen of Spades. This happened later. 1963, three teenagers died at a summer camp. The kids encountered the ghost in the mirror. 1985, two 15-year-old girls committed suicide. One of the mothers blames a woman in black. 1998, a boy jumped off a building crane. One of the eyewitnesses claims he saw a woman in black there. There are a lot more cases like that. It sounds crazy. Did you collect it all yourself? Yes. I had a reason. There must be some way to stop her. There's no way, it's impossible. You must come with me. Come on, get all you need, I beg you. I'm done with it. I know exactly how it will end. And how will it? Look. It's my daughter. If you don't come with me... What's the matter? Did I frighten it? No, it wasn't you. Did you bring something with you? Something that belonged to a dead man? As if that wasn't enough. How old did you say your daughter is? Looks like this story will never end. Anya, are you alright? Yeah, I'm ok, Mom. What's the matter? - Don't touch me! - Anya, what's the matter. - Don't touch me! - What's happening? Anya? Anton! Leave me alone! Hold her. Let me take a look. There! Hold her hand, hold it! Shit! It's a tag. - What? - A tag! Help me. Hold her. What are you doing? Don't worry. I'm a doctor. Used to be one. Hold her tight. That's it. There, there... Calm down. Look at me. She needs to rest. A tag is a cursed object. It can be anything: a button, a chain, a piece of jewelry, something that the demon uses to cling to its victim. It's just some cheap Chinese trinket. Don't be so stupid. American, Chinese, as if the demon cares. Is she sleeping? What is it for? It's Lola. Canaries can sense the smallest ultrasound vibrations. They're an ideal detector. People can't hear it. Let's take a look. She is nourished by any reflecting surfaces. Photons, light quanta, are reflected in the mirror and make her impact stronger. No witchcraft, pure physics. - What are you doing? - Step back. Did you try to look in the mirror from its side when you were a kid? Good for you. You better not. I used to have one like this. Silver halides on the film capture the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Digital cameras don't do so well. Oh, I see. Hush, Lola, it's ok. It's the electromagnetic activity. Wait, don't! Don't cover it. Let her show herself. - What is it? - What? - She's here. - Where? - She is... - It's alright! She is strangling me. - It's ok. - Look at me. Raise your head. Anton, cover the mirror. Look at me! Come in. I had a teenage son. I was a GP at the local hospital then. He told me about the Queen of Spades. He said she came out of the mirror. I didn't believe him. Thought it didn't mean a thing. I thought he didn't want to study. Then he started having hysterical fits. One of my friends worked in a mental hospital, I took the boy to him. He got diagnosed with sluggish schizophrenia. When I realized he wasn't schizophrenic, it was too late. How did it all end? It ended badly. Here she is. Do you know how to stop her? Well... It's not the mirror. Not the one where she was summoned? That one was cracked, broken. Don't keep broken mirrors at home, they are the worst. You must do it exactly the same way you did it that time. Let her come out to you. Then you should try to return the ring. How do we return it? I don't know. There's no specific way. You have to feel it. The ring is a Symbol. You should set your minds free from the Queen of Spades, send back the fear she imposes on you. It was the kid who summoned her, let her do it. Do it my way, it won't work otherwise. Queen of Spades, show yourself! Go on. Queen of Spades, show yourself! Queen of Spades, show yourself! What's next? Wait. - Did we do it wrong? - Focus. I can see her. The bird would have sensed her. Daddy! She's coming! Something is wrong. The bird doesn't sense her. Daddy! No, you can't. Don't go in! You can't go in. They have to do it themselves. Help me, for Chrissake! Wait! No, no, no, no! You can't! Anya! Anya, can you hear me? Anya, the ring! You must return the ring! Anya, can you hear us? Oh my God, do something! I can't, she has to do it herself. Anya! Sweetie! Anya! Anya! Honey! Anya! Anya, my baby! How are the girls doing? Fine. Still sleeping. Remember, I used to make breakfast all the time. You never did! I did all the time. No. You must have forgotten. I haven't forgotten anything. You have forgotten it all. Well? How does it feel? She's gone. Good. Good. What's the matter? Come on, it's ok. Let's hope your Mom will get us something to eat. Your Dad can't cook at all. Don't tell him, ok? Anya? What is it? What is it? Anya? You bet he can't. What are you gonna do? Not again. I'm in no hurry. We have to go back right now. Ouch! I've cut my finger. Tough luck. Anya? What is it? Anya? Where's Anya? Don't! Don't go in there. Hush! Anya! Baby! She has a fever. Call the ambulance. There, there... I need the emergency kit. Anya! What? Anya, sweetie! There, there. Sit down. You're not helping. Hush, hush! She's choking. - How is she? - I don't know, they won't let me see her. Of course they won't. You shouldn't have taken her to the hospital. She had a fit! I was scared! Follow me. Quick. We have to hurry. We don't have much time. The doctors must have mistaken it for an epileptic seizure: the fit, foamy saliva, fast heart rate, skin color, looks like hypoxia, right? The Queen of Spades doesn't need the ring anymore, she's strong enough for a new tag. Your daughter is her tag now. Quick. Come in. Put these on. Go down the hall to the end of the unit, get your daughter and take the lift down to the bottom floor, that's where the old operating rooms are. - How do you know? - I used to work here. Hush. So, Dad? Got yourself a new whore? Anya, don't! Step aside! Lie down, come on! You'll die, bitch! You'll die. Follow me. Hurry! We don't have much time. Put her here. Tie her down. Daddy! Daddy! Where are we? It's ok, Anya. It's ok. Don't talk to her. It's not her. Daddy! Let's leave. I'll try to remove the Queen of Spades from Anya, but there's a problem. I'll inject her with a strong toxin to provoke the ventricular fibrillation. It will result in cardiac arrest and clinical death. It sounds terrible, I know, but listen to me. In the state of clinical death the Queen of Spades will leave Anya's body. In 3 minutes, I'll reanimate her. All the processes are reversible. I'm scared. Daddy! Anton, we're leaving. You have no choice. If I don't do it, the Queen of Spades will take over and you'll lose your daughter. It's our only chance. The girl is healthy, she'll manage. Yes, it's dangerous. But I'll be able to start her heart again, I promise. It sounds crazy. Anton! My son had the same thing. And you killed him. No! I had to try! I had to try! - Anton. Don't listen to him. - You haven't had enough? Mommy! Mommy! You can feel I'm right. I'm only here because of your daughter. If it weren't for her, I wouldn't have come with you. Don't! Anton! You have to make the decision. Don't, Mommy! Please, don't! Daddy! You're crazy! - Please, don't. - Anya! You're crazy! Listen to me. He's right. We have no other choice. It will just take three minutes. Rats' DNA is a 70% match to ours. The Queen of Spades will get into the rat. Then I'll reanimate Anya. - Help me! Hold her. - Don't! You will regret it! Cardiac arrest. That's it. Is it supposed to be like this? I don't know. It isn't working. Reanimate her! Too early. How do you know she is going to get into this rat? She has to. If she doesn't, she'll lose the connection to our world. Come on! Come on! Come on! It's not the rat she will get into. Wait! Come on! Come on! Do it! Come on! Come on! She's getting into him. Anton, can you hear me? Hold on, don't let her in. Hold on! No, it won't work. He can't. Come on, bitch! You want me! Leave him. I'm here! Wait, let me see. Shit. Wait... Get back! We need more! 400... It's ok... One more time... Come on! Anya! My little girl! Get upstairs. Don't talk to anybody. Forget the whole thing. Are you coming? No. I must finish it. Is there no other way? We've got a score to settle. - We've got a score to settle. - Thank you! What are you going to do now? Hurray! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear Anya! Happy birthday to you! - What's your wish? - If I tell you, it won't come true. - Who's gonna cut the cake? - Dad! Sure. Come on. Do it, I'll be back in a moment. Hello. Would you like to subscribe to a magazine? No, thank you. You can do it for your wife or girlfriend. - We can give you a discount. - No, thank you, not now. Ok... Have a nice evening. Where did you get this ring? - It's a present. - Who gave it to you? A man did. Throw it away. Weirdo. Who was it? Wrong flat. Give some to Sasha. Dad? Are you alright? Now I'm definitely alright.
