Why do you like taking close up photos? I'm fond of close up photos, because they reveal something more of what we are unable to see than from a larger perspective. When you take portrait photos, what do you focus on? I think I focus most on the eyes. You'll have to excuse me. The little one's crying. Gosh! He's gorgeous, but... too bad he has a baby already. Hey, why are you crying? Are you hungry? Are you a furious little baby? You feel better now? Everyone... has a special someone in their hearts. Every time we think about them, it makes our hearts... tinkle inside. They will always remain in our hearts. Even though I don't know how he's doing, or where he is now, at least he taught me about... my first love. No wonder you want to come here every day. What? He's got really weird scooter. Huh? Hey, look! She's a very pretty thing! Do you like her? Hey, look at her! He's gorgeous. There's so no doubt that you're into him. -Right. -I'm not into him at all. Ooh? Oh, hello. This way, please. Hello. Fried rice and breakfast for this table, Mom. After you're done with that table, can you go to the market for me? -Sure, Mom. -Good girl. How's school, dear? It's going well. I'm hanging out with my old gang, Cheer, Kie and Nim. You've been with them since first grade. Aren't you sick of each other already? Well, you wouldn't have anyone else to hang out with, even if you wanted to. You guys are ugly ducklings. -You... -Ouch! Hey, let me tell you something. Who we hang out with is not all about looks, you know? But how you look counts for first impressions. It's good that I take after you. If I looked like Dad, like Nam does, I'd never have a boyfriend. -Hey! -Ouch! Enough, you two. You're too old to fight. The two of you stop it. Don't talk like that about your father. If he hears you, he'll be upset. Go now. Be on your way. Huh! He's in the States. He can't hear me. You want some mangoes? SAFETY FIRST Mangoes? The new seniors are so cute. Yes. Yes. I've been in an all-girls school since kindergarten. I'm so sick of that. Have you got it? Yes, mine adds up to 28. Twenty-five to thirty-five. You're compatible with men who are leaders, who are warm and kind. Must be... -Tong, Chairman of the Buddhist Society. -No. Cheer got 15. Fifteen to twenty-five. You're compatible with athletes, just and fair. Must be Ken, the basketball player over there. -Wow... -Ah! Oh... It couldn't be him. Mine must be a bad boy. That's quite right. It must be... Meaw, the tough guy. -Kie. -Nam got 30. Thirty. You're compatible with artists, unique and artistic. Who must he be? You seem a little down for English class. Could you be a little more active, like you were during lunch? Wow. Don't smile just yet. You seem to be doing well only in English. Your other subjects are so bad. Ugly duckling. Today, we'll be studying vocab and grammar from song lyrics. Please pass on the paper. His name is Shone. SECRET INFO He's a junior. He has quite a reputation. Maybe it's just a rumor. Students, for the word "inspiration," if we change the A to an E, it becomes the verb "inspire," which means, "To motivate." Two girls left the school because of him. DON'T BUY IT So, better stay away from him. My friend's sister went to the same school as Shone. -Really? Is it true? -Yes. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT? What are we talking about? NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS BUT I'M TEACHING "But I'm teaching"? -Cheer! -Yes. What does, "You are the inspiration," mean? What does it mean? YOU INSPIRE ME You inspire me. "You inspire me." You're the inspiration. Everyone is inspired by someone. Even I'm inspired... by someone. -Thank you, teacher. -All right... Let's read all together now. LADIES' ROOM Akarin, would you solve this equation, please? Who did this? Ouch! What's this? What are you looking at? Oh... Teacher Orn. -It's in. -Wow. You're good. When are you going to try out for the school team? Playing just for fun is much better. You're still scared, huh? Come on, let's play. Shone? Hey, I'll be right back. -Who is that girl? -Who? Why is Shone talking to her? -Who is she? -Who is she? -Who is she? -Who? -Maybe she's his ex? -That's not true! Sorry. Uncle Chang! Mom, Nam, Uncle Chang's here. Hello! We missed you so much. -Uncle Chang? -Uncle Chang! Hello, Chang. Hey, Pang, long time no see. Your head still smells funky. Oh, Nam? You're all grown up now, I hardly recognize you. Hey, Pim. Oh! Hey, Uncle. -Are you that sleepy? -I think it's jet lag. -I'm still adjusting to Thailand time. -Oh. -Here we go again. -Hey, hold it! Is my dad as fat as you are? Your dad is working as a sous chef. He's doing all the heavy jobs, so he's very buff right now. I have a photo from him to show you. -Hey, let me see. -Hey! Wait! Pim? Your man said he'll transfer more money this month. He told me to tell you that... "Honey, I promise I'll pay off the mortgage for this house. You and the kids hang in there." He should visit us sometimes. He said that if one of you can be top of the class, he'll send a ticket to you so you can visit him in the States. Wow. Plane tickets are quite expensive. Do you think he'll keep his promise, Mom? He knows that being top of class is quite difficult, dear. You'll see. I will be the top of my class, so he knows I can do it. FIGHT FOR THE GIRLS - DAD You're going from rank 30 to the top? Two strawberry sodas and two orange sodas, please. -Hey! -Ouch! Hey, two Pepsi's. I'm so thirsty. How can you do this? I'm just really thirsty. Do you have a problem with that? Haven't you heard that men, children, and basketball players get the privileges at this school? And I'm a basketball player. Can I have four Pepsi's for the soccer players, please? Will Pepsi do? Yes... Damn it! Hey, don't kick at me. Sorry, OK? Hey! Hey. I can handle this. Nam, Shone and Ding are having a fight behind the school. Huh? Stop! Where are you going? Let's take the scooter! It's faster. Come on! Nam! Hurry! I think you can handle him. So, you want to be a hero like your dad? He was a loser. Did you guys know that he missed the penalty kick and cost us the National Championship? It took ages to make it to the National Championship. Damn it! Ouch! Oh, we just missed seeing Ding getting beat up. Let's go. Do you still want this soda he gave us? If you're not going to drink it, can I throw it away? "Do not drink." Why is it in the freezer if you can't drink it? All right, students, I have two announcements for today. Our school has become filthy due to littering, and the students are ignorant. So, from now on, anyone who litters will be fined one baht per piece. For anyone feeling this is too expensive, I have a promotion. Pay 50 baht per day and you can litter anytime, anywhere, and I'll just clean up after you. Will the students with the following names please proceed to the Disciplinary Office. Jakawan, Class 4/5. Achawin, Class 4/7. Ouch! -Ouch! -Cross your arms. There! If you get into fights again, I'll inform your parents, you hear me? Shone, you have great talent in photography. Why don't you enter the provincial photography contest? I think you should apply. Maybe you can do something for our school instead of wasting your time fighting. Do you understand me? -Yes, sir. -You may go now. -Thank you. -Thank you. Next. I'm sorry about... what happened yesterday. I'm really sorry. It's OK. It's not your fault. Band-Aids for you. Get well soon. Nam? Thank you. Yay, he knows my name! He knows my name! Hey. They actually have books like this? Oh! 20 Ways to Get Your Guy. There go the white ribbon girls. I'll be right back. Look at her. Since when is she friends with them? Is she for real? HOW TO BE A TOP STUDENT Of course I am. I miss my dad. -I haven't seen him for five years now. -Wow. Earn, Kai's now in love with me, because of this book. Really? This book really works? -Yeah. -Pooh also bought this book before she got together with Toh. 9 Love Tips really works. You're not going with them anymore? No. They're saying I outshine them. Tip number one. The Greek belief for how to win someone's heart. Look at the stars in the sky, and connect the stars with your fingers to make the name of someone you love in Latin. -Hey, wait up! -What? I can't do it. Nam, why don't you join us? I won't. I think it's nonsense. -Gotta get this right. -I'm going to do it at home. -See you guys. -We're going, Nam. Later! You're practicing real hard. Do you have a soccer match somewhere? Just around here. -Catch! -Hey, I can't! I told you I can't play! Watch where you kick, OK? I thought you were Chinese? Oh, yeah, sorry. My ancestral accent comes out every time I'm upset! Ouch! Hey. Come on. Look at this, Shone. How about it? A poster of the photography contest that you asked about. I see. Look at him. He can play soccer day and night on the streets, but he refuses to join the school team. He's just having fun. I don't think he's taking soccer seriously. Even if he was, he wouldn't join the team. I should have scored that penalty kick. There you go again. Don't blame yourself. Maybe he's not really feeling ashamed. But even if he is, he has to get over it by himself. Look at you now, at how far you've come. You look a bit strange. Look! I have new braces for my teeth. Do you like them? They don't look all that special to me. Hey, here, look here. I still don't like them. Hey, you picked Ken? Yes. Eat now. He did it! He actually ate it! Are you crazy? He's in the middle of his lunch. This is not hypnotizing. What are you guys doing? Tip number two. An ancient method of the Mayans. Concentrate and look at the one you love, and try to hypnotize him to do what you want. -If he acts as you order... -Turn around. -...it means that he is your soul mate. -Turn around. Turn around. Hey, he turned around. Who? Oh, no one. Are you hypnotizing Shone? No, I didn't do anything. I thought you said this book was nonsense. Well, taking beliefs from different cultures and various islands is kind of weird. -Then why are you following the book? -I... Hey! You can tell us the truth. -Right? -Yes. I don't want to be teased. Don't you worry about that. Because we will definitely... Tease you! Tip number three. The Scottish way of saying you love someone is to give a gift to someone anonymously just so that the person knows that someone has a crush on him. -No, don't drop it! -This jelly is mine. How could you drop it? Well, it just fell... Thank you so much, Teacher Pon. -Salted eggs. -Yes. Oh, I must have been on your mind when you were traveling. I'll finish them all. Thank you so much. Thank you. Teacher Pon's eggs, oh! Teacher Pon's eggs and some salt, oh! Teacher Pon's salted eggs, oh! It's correct. Teacher Pon brought me eggs. Teacher Pon's salted eggs... Oh, don't tell me... Yes, they're from Teacher Pon. -How many boxes have you got? -Four. Four boxes? Salted eggs. I hope you can finish them all. See you. Oh no! No! My scooter's ruined! I forgot we live in a tropical country. -Mangoes? -Yeah. People give flowers and handkerchiefs as gifts. What's so romantic about mangoes? Hey, look over there. Wow, cool dude! Go. Mango cake. I made it myself. Thank you. It looks delicious. -Ouch! -Are you OK? I'm all right. OK, we're dead. She only has to do that. Right. She's adorable and she bakes. How can you beat that? Better find another boy. DON'T CHEAT Actually, I already have plans, but if you invite me over for dinner at your place, and this is would be our first date... If you're not free, that's OK. Next semester, then. Oh, wait! Actually, I'm free. I accept your invitation. Teacher Pon. See you later this evening. This dinner is not just for the two of us? It's not actually a dinner. It's a party for the end of semester. A lot of our colleagues are coming. -It'll be fun. -Oh, OK. -Teacher Orn. -Teacher? -I never give up. -Wait... This time... -it's war. -That's my answer sheet! Oh! Higher. -Teacher... -Lift me higher, Nam. I got it. We have to make Shone give Nam a lift home. Yes. It's your once-in-a-lifetime wish, isn't it? Yeah. When he drives you home, after getting off the bike, you hand him the mangoes. Oh my! How romantic is that? You have to pretend your scooter's broken. How will I do that? He'll know once he tries to fix it. That's true. You must lose your keys. How? They're right here. -Hey! -They're gone. Hey, Shone is there. Look there. Ouch! Mango cake girl, what's wrong with your leg? I tripped and must have sprained my ankle. Come, I'll give you a lift. That's all right. -Ouch! -Hey! Come on, let me take you home. I'm a little clumsy. Wow, what a show! Did she go to acting school or what? BYE-BYE GRADE 7. SEE YOU ALL IN GRADE 8 -Mom, come see this. -What, dear? -Pang, you little brat. -Mom! Nam has a boyfriend. CRUEL SHONE Nam. How can you go to see your dad if you're like this? I think this can wait until you grow up. Right now, concentrate on your school work. Hey, Cheer. What brings you here? Your little sister said you've been depressed for weeks now. You've been listening to sad tunes all week. I thought you must have gotten over Shone by now. Keep your voice down. Mom might hear us. She's off to the market already. -Don't push me. -Ouch! When's your mom going to expand these stairs? Hey, Nam, hear one more tip, OK? Listen carefully. Tip number seven is from the Gypsies. Let love inspire you. The power of love shall make you smarter, prettier and better in every way. Then that person will finally notice you. Hey, what the hell? Shone is gorgeous, so Nam should be beautiful... OK, do that later. My skin's coming off now. Or return to the old days No matter how long... -What is this? -Turmeric. Let's go. Hey. Hello, girls. Let me know how I can help you, OK? Have a look around. WHOLE TOWN DISAPPOINTED PORNCHAI MISSED PK FAILED TO WIN PROVINCIAL CUP I don't see him anywhere. Maybe he's not home. He's probably out. I don't see his scooter. Have you found what you were looking for? Ah, yes. This one. What are you buying? You play table tennis? Why are you so yellow? Do you have jaundice? Shone. -Mango cake girl. Here to buy something? -Yes. I need a dozen table tennis balls. Come, I'll get them for you. Come on, kids. -Join my Drama Club. -Drama Club, anyone? We have a lot of plays for you. You can be a princess or a prince. You can star in our plays. The lords of comedy were in my club. Come here. DRAMA CLUB -Anyone interested? -Join us? The father of talk shows was also in our club. -Really? -This is your chance to make it. -Are you interested? -What? THAI DANCING CLUB -Join us, dear? Don't pass over me. Come. -Join the Drama Club. Join the Drama Club with me. Take off your glasses. -Your glasses. -But I feel awkward without them. I think we totally don't fit in with the pretty-polished-posh concept of that Thai Dancing Club. That's right. Teacher Orn always selects the smartest and prettiest for her club, and when they perform, the whole school goes to see them. Not like those weirdos in Drama Club. There are only ugly people there. No one ever watches their plays. Well, it's worth giving it a try. We may be a little dark and a little dorky, but we're pretty in our own way. Shone. Shone. Which club are you joining? Photography. Whenever you need a model, just let me know. I like photographing landscapes, not people. Are you kidding me? -If you say so. -Hey. Come on, get in the frame. You're not yellow anymore. Your skin seems lighter. Maybe... a little. I'll be watching your performance on that day, OK? Hey! You see, Nam. He said you look prettier. Keep your chin up, OK? If we get to do dance performances, it would be fantastic! -We'd be so smart and pretty. -Right. If you're not sure you're pretty enough, you're always welcome in other clubs, you know? Hey, that's not a very nice thing to say. I wasn't talk to you. I was talking to Funn, right? Liar. You said it to us. -Ouch! -Hey! -She said it first! -Stop it, girls! I don't want any troublemakers in my club. Wait. Faye and Funn, stay behind. Nam... I'm sorry about earlier. -I have to apologize, too. -Yeah. I bought an extra drink. You can have it. Wait. Let her drink it first. Why won't you drink it? Let's go. If you don't want a drink spiked with fish sauce, throw it away. How could she do that? There you are. I was looking all over for you. Look at me... and smile. Frown. Laugh. Perfect! See you tomorrow at the auditorium, OK? Teacher? Keep your voices down. I'm only accepting a few students. Understand? Can I have some? Teacher In? Oh? What's wrong? Are you OK? Are you all right? Hey! Teacher In? -How can I help you, sir? -Oh, nothing, How are you? See you tomorrow. Oh my... -Water. Need water. -Don't! It's a perfect match and I mean it. Teacher In. Maybe I shouldn't let you do the play if you're this late. -OK. -Hey! Wait! I was just joking! -Well... -Teacher. We meant to tell you that... No worries. -I'll give you the best parts. -Well... We meant to tell you... Come on, help me out... We want to dance... -Dance... -Dance... Dance... in your play. Because we're so happy to be in your play. This year, I proudly present... the play called... Nam, your English is better than the rest. You play Snow White, OK? Me? Ahem! Yes. Ready! Oh! What are you doing here? I'm here to paint. Then what are you doing inside the box? I bought interior paint. Go paint elsewhere. Wait a second. Get me all the phone numbers of those in Art Production. Teacher Pol, my students are gifted in acting, -I'm sure... -But, Teacher... -Are you all right? Are you sick? -No. I feel fine. Oh, maybe you're not used to my natural beauty. Lipstick is a waste of money. And most importantly, I just want to give someone a head start. Perhaps you went a little too far? Well, let's compete with our work. Because going by our looks, we're neck and neck. I've trained the students to put on makeup just like my natural style. Ta-da... And this is how you get the natural look. Are you sure you trained them? Is this a play or a circus? It could be a circus, Teacher Orn. This is the kids' creativity. Damn! 9 LOVE TIPS You're going home? Yes. SHONE'S NUMBER Get home safely. She was walking fine... when she got here, wasn't she? -Teacher. -Yes. -Would you like some water? -Thank you. -Well, Teacher... -Yes? My football's going to be out of air. Sorry about that. This is Pin, a junior. She'll be taking care of costumes and makeup for our play. May I have a round of applause for Pin? -Please take care of this for me, Pin. -I think we should get started. OK, let's get started with me. -Yes? -Oops, I forgot I'm not in the play. Let's start with Snow White, then. -Start with me? -Yes. You first. Wow. What do you think? She looks the same to me. Snow White with braces. Uncle! I don't want braces anymore. I want to take them out. DR. WITOON'S DENTAL CLINIC Nam, are you there? OK, ready. Stand by. Where's the prince? He has diarrhea. On a final rehearsal? Is he crazy? Hey! You! The painter! Can you fill in for the prince, please? -Me? -Yes, be the prince. It'll be quick. Closer. Get closer. When I say action, lean towards her to kiss, OK? Hey! Nam! You're going to break your neck there. Hey, too long already! Go back to painting. Nam, standby. Koi, ready. What the heck? Oh! Ready, and, action. Hello, This is Pornchai Sports Shop. Well... May I please speak to Shone? Shone speaking. Oh, he hung up. Wow! Where are you going? Toilet? The witch is here! This is the climax of the play. There's the witch. Look... She's not dead. She's going to solve her problem, you'll see. No one informed me about the fact that our student won the provincial photography contest. They just called to inform us now, sir. Teacher, try to keep up with the performance of our students, OK? Yes, I will. -Hurry up. -Yes. I'm trying. The iron is not working so well, sir. -This is why! -Yes? Oh, yes. Oh, could you plug it in for me? Well done, students, great job! You can still see the footprint. I ironed it. I didn't wash his shirt, sir. -Do you want me to wash it? -We don't have time. -Don't forget your bag. -Yes. Get going now. Go. Well done! Yeah! Dinner's on me tonight. Wow! Yeah! FOR SNOW WHITE I TASTED IT FOR YOU. IT'S NOT POISONED Hold on. One more time. Eat your heart out tonight! It's my treat! -Let's pack up now. -BBQ! -Let's pack. -Hey! "For Snow White." Who is it from? A bitten apple. It must be from Shone. -Wow, you really think so? -You ugly thing! Nam, maybe it's from that guy... Yuck! Prince Frog. -Princess Frog and Prince Frog. -No! What a jerk. Why didn't you come see the play? I bet you were watching those dancers. What a jerk! -Mac doesn't feel a thing. -Oh yeah. Hey! -Hey, how's my little boy? -Hey, what brings you here? Hello. Guys, this is Top, my friend since kindergarten. Right. -Hello. -Hello. Hi. He's cute. Hey! Let's go. How long are you going to stay this time? Probably until my dad retires. -But if I can get into university... -Cute! He's so cute, just like Shone. Let's go see the cafeteria. Hey, pretty girl. What's your name? Yes, you. What's your name? Don't be shy. Going already? You want a little fight with me, girl? Hey! I think Teacher In put it on. It's probably been showing all day. Let's go. Hey, that's Snow White on TV. She's cute. Does she have a boyfriend? I don't think so, but I don't think you should ask her out. Why not? Isn't she too young? Hey, I've asked for the numbers of fifth-graders before. BYE SOPHOMORES, HELLO JUNIORS! SEE YOU SOON! STILL TAKING EXAMS. Shone, this is yours. I thought so. Every time we play soccer, you always have to give me a penalty kick. You do it. Hey, you're still not over it? Your dad must have forgotten about it by now. It's not that. That was too easy. Yeah, right, Mr. Cristiano Ronaldo. -Top. -Yes? -Can I take a photo with you? -Sure. -Can I have one, too? -Of course. Then who's going to the photo for me? Will you take one for me first? -No way! -I can take it for you. Thank you. -A bit closer. -OK. Three, two, one. -Ouch! What is it? -Why are you stealing my scene? -Easy, girls. -You did it! Stop. What happened? All of you stop it! Stop it right now! Isn't this too much? I have no idea. Stop it right now! -Oh gosh! -Gosh! I was the referee, sir. Oh my God. How many days until District Sports Day? About two weeks, sir. The athletes and cheer squad are practicing hard. Who's going to be the drum major now? I think I will have to ask Teacher Orn for some help. Maybe she can find someone. Don't worry about that, sir. I got it. Ouch! It's nothing. Nam. In my entire life, I've never met anyone as perfect and excellent as you. You look incredible and fabulous. Teacher In. Please get straight to the point. What can I do for you? Well, I was wondering... if you could be the school's drum major for District Sports Day? -What? -I'm not looking at anyone else. You're perfect for it. But that's in two weeks. I don't think I can do it. I cannot find anyone else. Let's do this. I promise I'll make it up to you in a religious way. In a religious way? I can pray for you for six months... or forever. I can definitely do that. Hold the baton upright, look up, then throw. Keep your eyes on the baton. Catch it when it's coming near. Then, continue marching. See? As easy as that. Can you show me? I have my own baton. You can do it. That's yours, this is mine. Focus on how high you want to throw it, and throw it up when you're ready. Three, two, one. Up! Oh no! This is difficult. Why didn't she pick someone else? Don't give up just yet. It's only been a few days. The most important tip in 9 Love Tips says that you should give it your best shot in love. Wholeheartedly give it all you've got. Then, the person you love will find you. Nam. You've come this far. You have to keep fighting. This is not only for our school. You're representing our town. You can do it. Top, pass the ball. Pass it here. Hey! Hey, you're distracted by girls again. I promise you that our marching band will be the best in town this year, sir. -What about the drum major? -Oh, you need not worry. She's pretty, tall and fabulous. She's just perfect. Watch out! Oh no! -Sorry. -OK. Don't tell me that's our drum major. Oh, yes. But she's been doing well, sir. It's the first time she messed up. She's throwing her baton like a boomerang. What if she messes up on Sports Day? No incident like that will happen, sir. Get a new drum major, -or I'll be after you. -Oh, sir. But we only have one week to practice, sir. This is not looking too good. The director confiscated the baton? Who's going to be our drum major now? I don't know. Serves Teacher In right. She should've picked one of us pretty girls. I don't know how she could pick such ugly student. Her students are always losers. I'm glad she didn't pick us. Right. -How can you say that? -It's true. Ass face. I'm going to prove them wrong. Students of Teacher In are not always losers. You're going use a broomstick? Where did you get that? I borrowed it from the janitor. It's a bit light, but it'll do. I will not let anyone look down on us or Teacher In. Everyone! Today, I'm asking for 100 percent from you. Hmm. There. Hey, that's a foul. Hey! Oh no. You're going to take the penalty kick? My son's going take the penalty kick. -Let's leave. -Hey, wait, hold on. Unbelievable! Shone's going kick a penalty goal. I can't believe my eyes. Come on, he's going to kick now. No... -Let's do it again. -That's all right. Do you guys know why we lost the National Championship? It's because of his dad. Wait. That was just a warm up kick. Have another go. A warm up penalty kick is a thing? In my book, it is. In my book, too. Mine, too. And I haven't blown my whistle. -Yes, sir. -One more time. -What? -He's going have another go at it. -Hey, hey. -Come here. He's going to do it. Hurray! My son did it! If you kick like that, you're ready to join our school team. -Yes. -Yeah! Yes, Shone did it. Wow, he's all smiles now. I get it now. Wow, very good. Perfect, dear. My goodness! Excuse me Teacher Orn. I was wondering whether any of your students can throw their headdress that high and catch it? Higher than that! Very good! So, your sister is as pretty as I am now? She much prettier. There! Fabulous, Nam. I don't want to move anywhere. You say that every time. You're way too hot, Nam. Last Valentine's Day, -she was still very dark. -Right. I'm going to take Kai's gift for her. -Have you asked Nam? -I don't know. Can I have this pink chocolate, Nam? OK. -What? -What's wrong with her? She looks down. She's been waiting for him all day, and he hasn't shown up. Hey, Nam. Come here. Hurry. -Go ahead. -Huh? Here. It's from a friend of mine. "See you tomorrow at four on the third floor staircase." "I have something to tell you." That boy, Champ, is so cute... -Hey Shone. -You're still here? -Do you want to leave together, Shone? -You guys go first. Nam... I knew you'd come. This letter was from you, Top? Yes, it was from me. Did you want anything? Well... Would you like to be my girlfriend? What were you going to tell me, Shone? Oh... I was just going to ask why you were here. But... now I know. So, what do you say? Silence means yes to me. What? Top? Where did he come from? And that's all Shone said? That's right. What was your answer? I didn't say anything. What should I do? You have to think twice since he's Shone's best friend. If you make a wrong move, Shone's going to kill you. Are you free today? Want to go see a soccer game? No, I'm not free. It'll only take a little while. Shone's playing for the team for the first time today. Do you want to go? OK, I'll go. Nam. Get on. -Some water. -Thank you. -Do you have some water? -No. Let's go to plan B. -Faster. -To the left. Move faster! Dear button, I really want to ride with Shone. SUMMER HOLIDAY! SEE YOU IN JUNIOR YEAR YOU'RE JUST OUT OF MY REACH, ANGEL... What kind of cake would you like for your birthday this year? Go pick one. Vanilla cake. -Nam loves it. -Good choice. Hello, Nam. Where are you? We're picking a cake for Cheer's birthday right now. -At the dam with Shone and his friends. -You guys are so slow... I won't make it back in time. I called Cheer this morning, but she didn't pick up. Please tell her happy birthday for me. Sorry, guys. OK, OK, we'll tell her. We'll take this one. Mac, help me here... -Grilled squid. -Thank you. -I'll be right back. -OK. What are you doing here all alone? Well... It's a great view here. Would you like some grilled squid? Have you heard the story about squid? No. I'll tell you. Once upon the time, two squid met and fell in love with each other. They decided to be together, and eventually they got married. On their wedding day, the reverend squid told them to hold hands, so they held hands. Held hands, held hands... You're so silly. But that's sweet. -The story teller or the story? -The story teller. Oh, the story. I'm all confused now. No more appetite for squid, huh? I've never eaten squid again since I heard that story. Then... have you ever held someone's hand like the two squid did? Once, I held hand of a clumsy girl. She was about to fall off the stage, -so I grabbed her hand. -Nam. Why aren't you eating the squid? It's really delicious. Don't! What? They're yummy. Seriously, do you like Nam? You're going out with her. Why are you asking me this? Oh, it's nothing. -Forget it. -Ouch! Are you all right? I'm fine, it just hurts a bit. -Can you try to walk? -Ouch! Come on, get on my back. Come. Give me that. Dear button, Shone carried my bag today. Is that you, Nam? Cheer's not here. She went with Kie and Nim. You didn't go with them? No. Give them a call... I miss the old days when we would do reports together, don't you? Angels should be in Heaven, not in Hell like us. Take it easy, Cheer. You'll have your birthday again next year. Nim, I only have three friends. I wouldn't have done that if I'd been her. Do you want to come over later to do the report? Why don't you write it with your new gang? Top's not here yet? He told me to tutor a sophomore. He's not here yet. He said he was going to borrow a book for the sophomore. That day, I was in the hospital. Which day? The day my dad missed the penalty kick. I was born that day. My dad never played soccer again after I was born. I'm such a bad luck. You see... our team never made it to the finals again. Are you OK? I'm used to all the teasing. It's OK. I'm fine. My last name is, "Shone, the son of the guy who missed the goal." But it's OK. I'm on the team now. Are you thinking of playing professional soccer? I don't know. Right now, I just want to have someone. Nam... I still can't find the book. Can you come help look for it? We won't take long, Shone! I love you, but you don't know So I kept it in my heart... Shone. What's the surprise for Ake's birthday? You'll see. Just imagine That we are lovebirds I love you, but you don't know I love you, if you want to know I love you but you don't know Time for our special show for tonight. Yeah! This happened when we were in fifth grade. Wow! We happened to like the same girl. Her name was Bo. She was in fourth grade. So, we both practiced dancing, hoping to be her partner at an event. When the day came, Shone... got chicken pox, so I got to be her dance partner. Hurray! But Top backed out on the day, so neither of us got her anyway. He threatened to not be friends with me, so we promised each other after that day... -That we would never like the same girl. -That's right. -Let's do this. -Huh? Same time tomorrow? Let's go see Shone's soccer match. You don't have to pick me up anymore. Why not? Are you busy? No. I mean you don't have to pick me up ever again. Are you upset because I kissed you? But you're my girlfriend, aren't you? Top. I never said I was your girlfriend. After all I've done? I'm sorry, but I have someone I like. Who is it? Who? Nam! This is the worst thing ever in the history of my love life. Can I ask you a favor? Could you not ask her out, no matter what happens? Do you think she broke up with you because of me? No. I just couldn't take it... if my best friend was seeing the girl I love. When you put it like that, there's nothing I can do. Are you OK with that? Yeah. Thanks, Mom. I've spoken to the manager of Bangkok Glass, son. What did he say? He said, maybe he'll accept you into the training camp for Bangkok Glass. He's not kidding about this, right? Nobody jokes about things like that. Just be ready. Maybe you'll have to move to Bangkok after high school. Dad! -Thank you. -Hey! Hey! You should have told me. I would've applied for the grant to go with you. Sorry about that. I was really preoccupied. I didn't have the chance to tell you. I think the director has found a new PE replacement. You're irreplaceable. I can confirm that. May I ask for something from you before you leave? What can I do for you? This... Maybe too much to ask from you? I asked for your heart but got a whistle. There's... the new PE teacher. Wow! I think you should hurry and be on your way. You might miss your flight. I feel occupied all of a sudden. Bye-bye now. -Oh! -Ouch! Hey! -Nice to meet you... -Well, well, well! You don't waste your time at all. -Hello. -Hello. -Aren't you the new PE teacher? -Yes. -What's your name? -I'm Boat. Oh, I'd love a boat ride. BYE-BYE JUNIORS. HELLO SENIORS! GOODBYE EVERYONE! GIVE ME A CALL! IT'S SUMMER BREAK AGAIN Why won't you stay for high school? I just love the pink uniform of the technical school I applied for. Silly girl. -It's pretty. -So, the whole school's in pink? What a scene! Monday, I wait for you Tuesday I am still waiting for you Wondering how you're doing Wednesday, you never show up I waited for you all day Thursday, nothing doing Friday, Saturday or Sunday Not a day goes by without missing you We can never turn back time Or return to the old days To the day we met The day we got closer The day we held hands The day I love you The day I told you The day you dream No matter how long How many months or years My memories of you shall remain I'll always think of you Cheer, I'm sorry. Why sing a song? Your song is so cheesy. Why did you sing along? We didn't. We were laughing at your song. -Nam. -Yeah. While three of us were buying ice-cream at the market, and we met Teacher In. She said that your exam results... your exam results... What about my exam results... That you are the top of the class. I thought that... -I'm the top of the class? -That's right! Mom, I'm top of the class this semester. Nam! You'll get to see your dad now. -Yes! -I'll get to see Dad! Get to see Dad! Can I kiss you for him? Nam, I ranked eighth in my class. Can I come, too? -Sure. -Wow! I'll bring you some toys and sweets. I'm going to the States. -Bring us back some snow, please? -Sure! Shone... You got it? Let me see... Is 50 baht OK? It's 100, take it or leave it. I had to sneak in and almost got bitten by stray dogs. -Seventy baht? -No way! Leave it then. No, give it to me. Hey! -Oh... -Nam! He's cute. Is he your boyfriend? It's Bam's boyfriend. No, I just took the photo for her. I'm not into boys. Please don't tell Mom. Mom, Pang's... -Mom! -Nam, please! What? Is the food ready? Pang's hungry. Almost done, dear. I understand. Just be a good girl, OK? What about you? What about my money? Come on have some snacks, kids. -Thank you! -Snack on these first, OK? Does Shone know how you feel about him? Wow. You've liked him since first year. I don't think you should tell him so it can be a world record that a silly girl has been in love with him for three years without him knowing. Nam, maybe you'll never see him again for the rest of your life. Aren't you going to do anything about it? 9 LOVE TIPS I've done everything the book says, haven't I? We're here to support you. What are you afraid of? -Right? -Yes. You are pretty, smart, nice, and cheesy. How can he not fall for you? Is that a compliment? Of course.

But that's a rose you're eating? He'll feel bad if I don't eat it. Oh... Five, four, three, two... We're now with the talented designer of those fantastic clothes we just saw. Hello. The audience must be very familiar with you already, since you're one of the few Thai designers who has been successful in New York city. These are some of her works. Here. I'll show you. These are just a few of her works. Do you realize that you're also becoming very popular here in Thailand? That's an overstatement. I still have a lot to improve upon. So, what will you be doing here in Thailand, could you tell us? Well, a brand contacted me to do a fashion show, a unique one. I thought it would be fun and interesting, so I said yes. And I also wanted to come back because I miss my mom. You've said before in your interviews that when you were young, you weren't exactly stylish. Sort of a bit dorky, perhaps, which was a completely different look. What was your inspiration for making such big change in your life? I fell in love with someone. Fell in love? Please tell us about it. Yes, well... -He was a senior. -Yes. A soccer player. He was very handsome. I was in Grade 7, an awkward-looking girl. I needed lots of improvement. I thought I had to be prettier, better, and smarter, so I did everything I could, just so he would notice me. How did it turn out? Did he know you were in love with him? Yes, but it wasn't exactly a happy ending. I turned out to be a good student, so I went to high school in the States and lived with my dad there. Oh, that's kind of sad. Come to think of it, he's been such great inspiration to me. I chose to use the power of love to inspire me in a positive way. He was like a great motivation to constantly improve myself. That made me who I am today. Nam, do you remember this scrap book? Does this look familiar? Yes, I remember. Let's meet with the owner of this scrap book, Mr. Shone. Ex-soccer star of Bangkok Glass. -Shone is here? -Is this for real? Today, he's now a renowned professional photographer. For you. For me? It's for you. Please, have a seat. Yes. Shone. Do you have anything to say to her after these nine years? Well... I just wanted to tell you that... the button is not mine. I think it belongs to Ding. Oh... What about you? Would you like to say anything? I... I want to ask you... are you married? Well... I've... Well... I've been waiting for someone to come back from the States. Can you hear my heart sing? It's saying I love you But I can't reveal the truth To anyone...
