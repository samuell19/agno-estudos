KK HOSPITAL 1 JANUARY 1976, SINGAPORE Three, two, one! Happy New Year! Once upon a time, there was a very lucky boy. No matter what he did, he was always the first. Even his birth was on the firstof the year. Not only did he symbolize a new hope for the country, but we also believed that in the future, he would excelin whatever he did. The first baby of the year is born. Let's go take a look right now. Good boy! I'm so happy. Isn't he handsome? But I'm not talking about him today. I'm talkingabout the baby beside him. That's right. I'm the second baby of the year 1976. I was almost the first, so it should be fine, right? I'm very happy. This is my first son, and today is the first day... By the way, since my mom gave birth to me in the hospital after she got drenchedin the rain, hence, my name is Lin Yu. Mei Ling. - Quick, tune in to Rediffusion. - It's about to start. Let's see which number can be the winning numbers. Mom, you bought so many sets of numbers. Which of these belong to Lin Yu? They all are. Look. This is Lin Yu's birthdate, birth time, height, weight, bed number, and my bed number. When you were born, your dad forgot to buy your numbers. We missed the jackpot. This time, there's no way I would forget to buy. After listening to this song, - Take these two sets - we'll announce the winning numbers for TOTO right away. Two. Six. Ten. Twenty. Thirty-seven. Thirty-nine. The additional number is 44. There's not even a single sign of winning, right? Not really, they're all... All of them are winning numbers? When we bought 1, it was 2. When we bought 5, it was 6. When we bought 11, it was 12. When we bought 21, it was 22. When we bought 36, it was 37. We have no winning numbers. Wow, we missed all of them by one? One word, unlucky! Mom, Lin Yu is really unlucky, isn't he? Sir, please analyze this divination lot. Nobody has gotten this lot for many years. - Ma'am, what do you want to know? - I'm asking to see my son's fortune. Your home is broken up by disputes without a cause, like withered blossoms drifting on a bottomless ocean. Grace will hardly aid an idiot or fool. A heap of troubles is all that remains. - Can you explain what you just said? - This is a story about Prince Yin meeting his doom. Meeting zombies? Why would that happen? What zombies? It's Prince Yin meeting his doom. Sir, I don't understand. Can you phrase it in simpler terms? In simpler terms, if you're looking for a home, it's difficult. Individually, it's not good. No luck with wealth. Unlikely to get hitched, let alone to have any offspring. - So what can I do? - Don't do anything. There will be mishaps if you attempt to do anything. If you don't do anything, there is no room for mistakes. You picked the worst lot. Is this clear enough? Buddha, please disregard the divination lot I got earlier. Please give me a good one now. Please. This is the bookstore my dadset up after he quit teaching in the year I was born. Thank you... - Here! - Boss. Is this book, Water Margarine nice to read? - Say it again. - Water Margarine. It's Water Margin! I'm going to smack your head. Hey, Mr. Lin. I feel that you're different here compared to when you were in school. Of course, I am. That's because in here, I don't see that sickening principal. Right? According to Mom, Dad quit his job because he disliked government's English education system. No wonder there are only Chinese books in the shop. This is the six-year-old Lin Yu. This is a very special year. Because this year, for the very first time, he met me. The master said, "There will be mishaps if you attempt to do anything." "If you don't do anything, there is no room for mistakes." Remember, don't be nosy! Understand? Hey, are you shoplifting? Yes, I am. What are you going to do about it? Dad. What's wrong? He's shoplifting. Young man, are you shoplifting? Yes, I am. What are you going to do about it? Sir, there's a shoplifter! Stand right there! Don't run! Come back! Darn you! Thank you, little girl. You're welcome. You have to voice out what's wrong. What you said is right. Bye! In your lifetime, you're bound to meet someonelike her. Someone you can't brush offor chase away, who will bein your heart forever. Li Lin. Over there, please. Xu An. Today is the first day of primary school. I unexpectedly bumped into her again. Suddenly, I felt as though I were Chow Yun Fat and of course she was Carol Cheng. Hey. I'll show you something. Do you see my red underwear? Actually, I'm Superman. Remember, don't tell anyone else. Okay? All right, okay. Lin Yu. Over there, please. Over there. Lin Yu? Lin Yu! Yao Guang. At the back. Candice. - I remember thinking back then, - Byron. "Does she actually remember me?" If she does, she has no reason not to smile at me. If she doesn't and I suddenly say hello, - Sean. - She would think I'm crazy. Over there, please. Li Lian. Hello, my name is Lin Yu! I'm Da Jie. Remember not to tell anyone that I'm Superman. Qing Qing, I think you'd better move to the back. Jeez. We almost sat together. But if I think about it, since she's my classmate, I'll definitely still have a chance. That's good enough. Class! Come collect your milk. - Yes! - Yes! You fell. Serves you right. Do you want this? There's no way I'm giving it to you. Stop laughing at him. Be quiet! Don't laugh! Thank goodness I got bullied by Superman that day or my Wonder Woman wouldn't have come to my rescue. Milk is sweet. It'll attract ants. Okay. You were really fierce just now. You have to voice out what's wrong. You spilled your milk. Here. - Is it for me? - Half for you, the other half for me. This is our first kiss. All right, everyone. As we've already explained, today, we're going to learn how to brush our teeth properly. Okay? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Side, front, side. Don't forget your biting surfaces. And then inside. Okay? Begin. That time when you saw someone shoplifting, why didn't you say anything? Mom said not to be nosy. Plus, that guy was really fierce. You can't do that. You have to voice out what's wrong. You're really brave. And you're really timid. When I grow up, I want to be like these fish, swimming freely. That must be really happy. Would they really be happy swimming freely? You're not a fish. How do you know they're not happy? You're not me. How do you know I don't know that they're not happy? You're not me either. How do you know I don't know that you know they're not happy? What? If I were to become a fish, what are you going to be when you grow up? I'll be the person that feeds the fish. What? Why? When you're tired and hungry from swimming, I'll feed you. Then you can continue swimming and be happy. Lin Yu, go and study spelling. - Okay. - Now! Hello, who are you looking for? My dad and mom are getting a divorce. What? They don't want me anymore. I scolded them! You scolded your parents? You have to voice out what's wrong! That's what they get for divorcing. Where are you now? I'm in the lobby of the hotel opposite my house. My aunt came specially from Malaysia to pick me up. Now what? I'm going to run away from home. Run away from home? That would be really troublesome. I know. It's because I don't have money. Do you have money to lend me? Yes, how much do you need? - A hundred dollars. - What? I only have three dollars and fifty cents. Hello? Hello? Why are you meddling with the phone again? Here, drink this. What on earth is this? I went to the temple and got this. After you drink it, you'll be lucky. After you drink it, we'll go buy some Ding Dang candy later. Drink it. Good boy. - Go and study spelling. - What? Hey! Must you take it from me? You're the worst! Both of you, no fighting during meals! - You... - Don't fight. Eat up. Here, listen! Watch! - Next up, we have local news. - Watch the news. Earlier today at around 11:20 a.m., one of the worst catastrophes since our country's independence had occurred. Hotel New World, which was built in 1971 along Owen Road... How can this happen? - Collapsed within a minute. - I'll go burn some joss sticks. I'm in the lobby of the hotel opposite my house. Hey, Lin Yu. What are you up to? Until now, the rescuers and paramedics are still undergoing search-and-rescue operations. Hopefully, they will manage to rescue more survivors from under all that debris. Hello? Hello? Hey, why isn't he eating? It's so sad. People are gone just like that. - It's really tragic, isn't it? - Yes. Poor thing. Just like that, Lin Yu didn't come to my rescue and so he thought I was dead. Actually, I just went back to Malaysiawith my aunt. The next time Lin Yu and I met was many years after that. Moonlight! This is the 16-year-old me. - Ever since my Wonder Woman left me, - Go! I've continued living a life of lacking. I've joined competitions everywhere, hoping that if my Wonder Woman hadn't died back then, she would've been able to see me. Sadly, my Wonder Woman was gone. But Superman is always around. Bearing the risk of becoming impotent, I used "Little Jie" to block the ball just now. If not, we would've lost. "Little Jie"? I'm Da Jie, so what's my "little brother" called? Yes, you're the bravest. Hey, Da Jie. Since you showed me your Superman underwear in primary school, I really don't understand this. Given that you were fat, it's logical that you were thick-skinned. Now you're so skinny, yet you're still so thick-skinned. You're seriously... That is why! Precisely because his skin is so thick, when he used his "little brother," the probability of being in pain is less. Right, it may even be empty inside. Are you guys doing standup comedy? Mocking me? You! Please be on-target for the penalty shootout later. Actually, no. Don't be too on-target. The goalpost is so wide. Yet you hit the goalkeeper's head every single time. Sooner or later, you'll kill him. This is a crucial moment for Lucky Secondary. Lin Yu has to score. If not, Lucky Secondary will lose, and Moonlight Secondary will win. We must have a goal. If we don't, we'll lose! It's all your fault! Why didn't you save that last shot? I didn't fail, okay? It was the striker who kicked wrongly. Look, if he kicked the ball towards where I jumped, then wouldn't I save the ball? Don't save. Relax. According to the Law of Probability, the goalkeeper will definitely not save this shot. Nice! - Don't save. - Don't save. - Don't save. - Don't save. Frankly, I often thought that if one day, Lin Yu and I were to meet on the streets, would we be able to recognize each other? Not once did I expect that this unlucky fellow is Lin Yu. See? The goalkeeper really didn't save the shot. Mom. So many sets of Preliminary and Mid-Year exam papers from other schools. You're really something! Later on, let's copy all the answers down and remove them with liquid paper for Lin Yu to try. Mom, not only for Lin Yu, but we can sort all these papers into different sets too. For example, Lin Yu's school papers and SAP schools' papers. A lot of moms would buy them for sure. We're going to be rich! Don't talk nonsense. If you really do that, all secondary school students will come after you. That's right, you silly girl! All of these are precious, why would we show them to other people? Plus, I only got them - after begging Mr. Yang for so long. - What? Just Mr. Yang. Why did you go find him? I've stopped talking to him for ages. It has already been decades since he stole your position as department head. His bootlicking face just irks me. Raffles, Victoria. There are so many school papers. Besides that idiot, which ones of my old colleagues did you look up? The difference between them and you is that they're university graduates. - Hey, where to now? - I'm heading home to watch football. - Tonight, we're up against Selangor. - Why are you like this? We just played football and you're going home to watch more. Aren't you sick of it? - Hey, what about you? - Of course I'm going home to study. Why are you like this too? We just lost a match and you're going home to study. Haven't you lost enough? Hello! We're only 183 days away from the O-Level exam. I study a total of eight subjects, which means I only have 22.88 days to study for each subject. If each subject has an average of two papers, that means for each paper, I only have 22.88 divided by 2, which is? You're too slow. It's 11.44 days. Also, let's not forget that every day, we have to go to school, eat, sleep, and go to the toilet. I even have to help you two do your homework. Seriously a burden. If we minus all these, basically, we only have 5.72 days to revise. That's not even six days! How's that enough? Must we be so precise? Sorry, I've already rounded off to two decimal points. Yes, you're so smart. That pervert touched you! Hey! Don't look there. Why not? Staring at pigs might make you fat. I've already grown fat. It's all your fault! I'm not exactly sure. But earlier during the soccer match, he really sat close to you. I see. No wonder he stands behind me during class every time, watching me do my homework. Perhaps he has been looking at me inappropriately? I must lodge a complaint against him. But we're taking the O-Level exam this year. And he's the best-looking out of all my teachers. If he gets fired, what will I do? Even the only good-looking teacher I have will be gone. You have to voice out what's wrong! But he's a teacher. No, you have to voice out what's wrong. You have to voice out what's wrong! When we get back to school later, we'll tell the principal. The bus is here. Let's go. Hey, what are you doing? That's not our bus. I think I saw Qing Qing. You say that all the time. For real! You say that all the time too. It's real this time. Really? - Then why don't you go after her? - You're holding onto me! Since when? Hey, both of you relax. I've already used my Law of Observation to identify their school uniform. Why don't we go to their school to find her? We can find her for sure. Is it really so easy? The school is so big and you think we can definitely find her. Don't be lame! We've waited for three days. Are you guys sure you haven't seen her? Yes. Actually, I don't even know what she looks like. You say that only after we've waited for three days. Thank goodness I came prepared. Help me identify her based on this. You should have given me this earlier. It's easier to find her this way. - Are you looking for your daughter? - This is Qing Qing. She looked like that the first time I saw her. Just find a pretty one who looks kind of like that. That would be her. Okay. Are you guys sure we're at the right school? According to my Law of Observation, we're definitely right. But are we waiting at the wrong gate? Is there another gate? Yes, there's a backdoor that leads directly to the bus stop. Why didn't you say so since you knew? The girls that come out from this gate are much prettier. - Over there! - Where? That's not Qing Qing. That's not it. Aren't the girls here prettier? You're really lame. I agree. You're wasting my study time. Please be more serious. What? I already know girls coming out of here are prettier. No! Just now, her skirt got caught by her bag. I could see flashes of red and even the lace lining! Lace! Seriously! Mr. Huang, I came here today to introduce you to a very outstanding student. That is my son, Lin Yu. He is excellent in his conduct and academic results. Here, take a look. These are all the comments written by his teachers. Hardworking, eager to learn, obedient, helpful, upright, and honest. These are all good comments. Besides, he is a key member of the school football team. He's versatile with his left leg, right leg, or both legs. He's good with his volleys, headers, free kicks, penalties. He's able to score no matter what. With his ability, he'll definitely be able to help the school win many medals. Even if he doesn't win the gold medal, he should get the silver. Even if he doesn't win the silver medal, he'll get you a bronze. - Especially... - Stop! - Hello? - Hello? Ms. Liang? Sorry, I was so busy. I was trying to figure out how many parents I need to see who have the same requests as you. They all want this school. It's so annoying. The Ministry of Education has warned us about enrolment. They are so annoying. I predict that the Ministry will have two ministers in the future. It's too much for one to handle. Yes. You're right. Mr. Lin, weren't you doing well with teaching? Why did you quit? What are you doing now? I opened a bookstore. A bookstore? You're right for not teaching. Children today are too difficult to teach. Do you know? These children don't bring their brains to school. Do you remember? When you used to teach my children, that's what you told them. Oh no, I'm usually a forgetful person! Why did I remember this incident? This is so annoying. Do you know? While some students do bring their brains along, they have it wrapped because it's new and they can't bear to use it. Ms. Liang, you have such a good sense of humor. As mentioned, if your school needs any computers, air conditioners, or swimming pools, I can make a donation. Wow, even swimming pools? I'm so grateful. Our school doesn't need them. But my house does. You guys can't give me anything though. The CPIB will be after me. Where did you get this from? I didn't see you hold it earlier. I bought it yesterday and left it in my bag. It's sweeter now. Try it. I don't want to. I can't believe you could drink this. Mrs. Lin is really something. With your results, she still managed to help you appeal to the Top Five. If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have risked cheating. Did you cheat? Say it louder. They can't hear. - Hey, I cheated. Did you hear? - Sorry. What I meant was, if Mrs. Lin could help me appeal as well, I could be like you and didn't have to score so well. Is it really a miracle though? If only finding Qing Qing was such a miracle too, that would be good. It has been so long. I wonder if she still remembers me. You guys are still so young. From the way you talked about her, I'm sure she does. Being childhood sweethearts and playmates. If she's near you, I'm sure you can feel her presence. Go away. Hey, wait a moment. It's only the first day of the first three months and you've already bought your uniform. Such humble-bragging. My chances of entering are 99.9999... Okay! Got it, you're capable. Always talking about probability. Let me treat you to bubble tea. Take it. Thank you! - Wow, this is nice. - It's sweet, yes? - Very sweet. - You have to voice out what's wrong! What's wrong, Qing Qing? Qing Qing, is it really you? Lin Yu! I've missed you so much. Me too. Where have you been? I've been trying so hard to find you. Qing Qing? Lin Yu? Is it really you? I'm so glad to see you again. This really is Qing Qing. I know. These are my friends. Wan Wen. Yu Mei, and Qing You. This is my friend, Ray. - Hello. - And this is... I'm Da Jie, do you still remember? Woo! Qing Qing just agreed to be my girlfriend yesterday. She has a boyfriend! I know. Why is there always a difference between imagination and reality? You have to tell me more about her. Excuse me. My name is Jie. Da Jie. My name is Wen. Wan Wen. See? Our lesson is starting. Let's hurry. Bye. Hey, let's go. After all these years, I didn't expectLin Yu to recognize me immediately. At that time, I really did feel ashamed. Come and play! Your face On a hot summer dayby the beach Here! It evokes a lotof beautiful memories Hurry! I can't seem to forget about it Here! Your face is oh-so-beautiful Don't disgrace us! You're so exaggerated. Looking forward to the day where I can see you again This is for you. Thank you. Qing Qing, hurry up! If Qing Qing's parentsdidn't divorce, she wouldn't staywith her aunt in Johor. It could be me standing nextto her right now. - Stop. Why are you doing this? - Tell me the truth. Do you like him? - He's my childhood friend. - Is it because of him? - Aren't you dating me? - Stop. You don't like me. - Now it's me? - Yes! - Fine, I'll go. - Hey! Thank you. I saw you and Qing You... Don't talk about it. Okay. Can I lie on your shoulders? Hello, Lin Yu. Hello, Qing You. Lin Yu! How are you? Not bad. How is Qing Qing? Not bad too. She has a slight cough and a sore throat. A cough and sore throat? How would you know that? She told me while we were doing homework yesterday. - What kind of homework? - Mathematics. Mathematics! And History. And History! We didn't have enough time to revise English. You asshole. Are you still denying that you stole my girlfriend? I didn't! Why are you hitting me? No? Why are you coming over to our school so regularly, joining Qing Qing in all activities? Isn't there any in your school? My brothers, go ahead. What are you doing? Don't move! Do you dare say you don't like Qing Qing? Even your underwear is green! - Take it off! - No, stop! My Wonder Woman is back. Qing Qing! Qing Qing ran away! Quick, get her! - Hurry! - Hurry! - Hurry! - Hurry! Hey! Get her! Why did you stop? Chase them! Dreaming of you, my dear I dream of you every night Stargazing with me I believe it's you It's you, only you It hurts. Thank goodness Wan Wen realized that Qing You was going to find trouble with you. Or else, your photos would be a big hit tomorrow. What? Is there something on my face? No. I just find that you're still as brave as before. You're the same too. Just like before. Still foolish. I'll fall down with that strength of yours. What is that? Nothing. It's just a notebook. Why are you so anxious? What's so special about it? Nothing, it's just a normal notebook for homework. - Let's take a look then. - What's so nice to see about homework? Just let me take a look at your homework then. It's just a normal notebook for homework. There's nothing special about it. That's weird. Give it to me! - Let me see! - No, stop! Give it to me. - Give it to me! - Stop! - Give it to me! - Stop! Don't snatch it! What did you write inside it? - Return it to me! - Just let me take a look. - Give it to me! - What is it? - Don't look! - Just a peek? Is it porn? Is this me? Yes. Some are from way back. Some are from today. This is when we were brushing our teeth. And this? This is... I didn't know if I would be seeing you again. So... I imagined what you would look like. My drawings are ugly. No, they're not. You drew really well. Really? Yes. Well, I'll... I'll give it to you. Okay? Really? Yes. Thank you. I'm sure all boys would be the same. When held by their crushes for the first time, they would be feeling this way. Goal! When talking to their friends the next day, it would be about... Such a great opportunity! Why didn't you kiss her? - How do I do that? - Just do it directly, forcefully. And most importantly, kiss the mouth. It's weird. That would be so sudden. Well, did you at least tell her that you like her? No. How do I do that? Use your mouth, not your butt. It's easy for you to say when you're not involved. I've always listened to you since young. But never once I succeeded. Wait a minute. When did we not succeed? Say it! Spelling. You cheated, but I was punished. Wait, that is just your luck. Football. You kicked someone, but I got a red card. Wait, the referee wasn't fair. Supermarket. You stole something, but I was caught. Okay, not counting that one time. - The point is, did Qing Qing hug you? - Yes. You always say that you're lacking, but now you're not. Why are you scared? Are you sure? It feels pretty far though. It's so tiring to speak to you. Ray, you talk to him. I'm angry. According to my Law of Intense Observation, Lin Yu and Qing Qing are so different. Think about it. Qing Qing is a girl. Lin Yu is a boy. Qing Qing is passionate! Lin Yu is passive. Qing Qing stands up for her friends! Lin Yu cannot stand... What? Cannot stand? I mean, he cannot even stand up for himself. Thank goodness! - And Qing Qing is... - Okay, stop. What is your point exactly? What I mean is, according to my Law of Probability, Lin Yu and Qing Qing being together isn't possible. Science Student, haven't you heard that opposites attract? - Yes. - Yes, right! Can you see it? In every boy's story of chasing his crush, there will definitely be a character like Da Jie. His ideas will definitely bring you trouble. But if it's for the girl I like, even if it brings trouble, I'll still do it. Using your strong arms, hold her. Oh yes! Use your eyes to tell her. I love you. I love you. LOVE YOU FOR TEN THOUSAND YEARS According to the Law of Perspective, I feel that the empty space is not artistic enough. Do you think we should spray Qing Qing's name on that space? Hello, Science Student. What do you know about art? If you spray Qing Qing's name there, what would I give Yu Mei tomorrow? Unbelievable. Your purpose for asking us to spray this is for your own selfish gain! Don't be like this. He uses it today. I'll use it tomorrow. And when nobody uses it, you can take it. This is called "killing two birds with one stone." You won't understand. Tonight is the night. Tonight is the night It's late. Qing Qing told me that she sleeps early. Her aunt isn't in good health. She sleeps early too. If we wake her up, her aunt won't be happy. If her aunt isn't happy, her mood will be affected. If her mood is affected, we won't succeed. Isn't that right? Hello, Qing Qing? This is Da Jie. Are you sleeping? Talking to your aunt? Talking to her aunt is a good sign. Is she doing well? She is! "Doing well" means that she's happy. Can you come down now? You'll know once you come down. Okay? See? Is she coming down now? No, she said tomorrow. Good, I still have time to prepare. It's now! What? I'm not done preparing yet. What should I do? Stop! Stop running! Police! Don't move! There! - Hey, stop! - In front! Police! - Hey, stop! - Freeze! Is this yours? This? Yes. Sir, I have one more! Here! Don't move! I said don't move. I'm so tired, you know? Lin Yu? Go. Since you like to spray paint, you should join SBC and become their props man. Bloody bugger. Making me run. What happened? None of our business. What should we do now? Don't worry. It's okay. My mom is a lawyer. And my dad is a prison officer. That year, Jacky Cheung's Kiss Goodbye was a sold-out hit. I was going to the army. I honestly thought that this budding romance, which never got to start would end. Hey! What are you doing here? Before you enlist, do you want to go to Kuala Lumpur to watch the Malaysia Cup Finals? Kuala Lumpur? Actually, Terence was the one who wanted to go. Terence? He's in my History class. He just got his driving license. He wants to try driving up to Kuala Lumpur. I immediately thought of you. You like football so much. I'm sure you would accompany me and accompany him, right? No. How can children travel unaccompanied? I'm not a child anymore. I'm already 18. What I said is final. If you really want to travel, we will accompany you. My friends said that it'll be more fun driving there ourselves. Driving? You don't even have a driving license! My friends do. Have you forgotten the story of Prince Yin meeting his doom? It's not going to be good. We must listen to the master. There will be mishaps if you attempt to do anything. If you don't do anything, there is no room for mistakes. It has been 10 years. I'm sure it has long expired. Besides, our son is old enough now. What if anything happens to him? You're going to the army soon. You have to start preparing. Go out with friends when you have time. Don't stay at home all day. Hey, let me ask you. Am I really such a mom's boy? Ever since I was young, she arranges everything nicely for me. I accept all the decisions she makes for me. Even if I object, in the end, I would still give in. You make your mom sound like our government. I really want to go. It's rare for Qing Qing to ask me out. Forget it. Even if your mom allows it, you'll end up being short of something. I don't want to be so wishy-washy. I don't want to accept my fate. I want to be brave. I want to fight for my own happiness. Fine, I'll listen to you. - I'll sneak out. - Excuse me! When did I suggest that you sneak out? How can you do this? Actually, I have another question. What is it again, Ms. Lin? She said her classmate, Terence, is going as well. That tall and handsome chairman from the Student Council? Yes, that's him. Wow, never have I expected Qing Qing to be so scheming to use this tactic. What tactic? She wants you to see that she has a guy. At the same time, she wants the chairman to see that he has a strong opponent to make him jealous. Having known Qing Qing since young, I didn't know she's so "scheming square." What's "scheming square"? "Scheming" multiplied by "scheming," you get "scheming square." Didn't you study Mathematics? You make it sound so bad. Maybe I shouldn't go. Good morning, Qing Qing. Morning. This is Terence. Hi, Terence. - Let's go. The Causeway might be jammed. - Hold on a second! You must show up and you must show some... Show what? Patterns. Show some patterns. What pattern? Since she brought you to make another guy jealous, you should bring a pretty girl along to make her jealous. Do you get me? Sorry. Sorry, I'm late. You're finally here. Wan Wen? Do you watch football too? Yes! She loves to do that. Honestly, I'm only going to see him. Then let's go. - Hey, I'll help you with that. - It's fine. - I'll carry it. - It's fine. It's fine. I can do it. I'll help you. I'll carry it. Come on, let's go. Let's go. Churchill once said. "Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others." Trouble arises when people are too democratic. People have no ill intent and wish only the best for you. Yet you think they are out to bully you so you just have to come up with some conspiracy theories. End up? All messed up! Lin Yu, have a safe trip. From Dad. You have to voice out what's wrong. The government isn't necessarily right. Can't Singaporeans discuss matters regarding Singapore? There are always two sides to a coin. Let me tell you. People are troublesome in that way. When you're nice to her, she'll take it for granted. When you're nice to someone else, she'll get jealous. Is Singapore all about efficiency? Wan Wen, guess what I brought? Or maybe it's the cleanliness or beauty of the Garden City. I think that apart from the usual, commoners can actually provide a livelier and more realistic version of the Singaporean story. It's like history. There are legitimate, proven history, and pseudohistory. Some people like Records of The Three Kingdoms, and others like Romance of The Three Kingdoms. Are you okay? Fruits. Can I have some? We want to eat these fruits. But I got some herbal tea. I made this myself. Wow, herbal tea. I love herbal tea the most. Lin Yu, you're so thoughtful. Let's listen to some songs. I would rather lose everything for you Than to be by myself What happened? I'll take a look. It's only our first time out and we got a flat tire. Where are we? I know. Okay. So we were here, right? We went east 2 km and then we went north a little bit. I think we're somewhere around here. Forget it. Let's change the tire first. - Do you have a spare tire? - Yes! I can ride a horse, shoot arrows, bake a cake, and play the piano. I even intend to run for elections in the future. But I don't know how to change tires. I'll do it. You can do it, Lin Yu! You can do it. Turns out I don't know how to change the tire either. It's going to rain. Lin Yu, any ideas? If not, we're really going to get drenched in the rain. We can go outside and see if there are any buses we can take. We've waited for a very long time. Will a bus really come? If there's a bus stop, then a bus should stop here. If we wait any longer, we're really going to get drenched. Look, a bus is here! A bus really stops here! The driver said there are only two seats left on the bus. The next bus only comes in half an hour. You can board the bus with Wan Wen first. Terence and I will wait for the next one. Oh, okay! Let's go. What... What about you guys? It's okay. Just half an hour more. We'll meet in Kuala Lumpur later. Okay, bye! Then, you... You guys be careful. Sir, this bus is going to Kuala Lumpur, right? Yes but first, we're going to Sunway, Petaling Jaya, Subang, and finally Kuala Lumpur. Are we really not going to Kuala Lumpur to watch the match? We won't make it in time anyway. Let's just settle down somewhere to watch. The referee is biased! - Goal! Yay! - Yay! Goal! That's Qing Qing and... Could you let me accompany you? Since you said you can't stay The road home is a little dark Worried about letting you go alone I think it's because I'm not gentle enough Unable to help share your troubles Since I can't say it out I'll keep these regrets in mind Keeping my sorrow to myself Mom's gone! FILIAL PIETY COURT I've never seen Lin Yu so devastated. However, what surprised me even more was that when we met again later, Lin Yu had become a completely different person. Guys, do you want a meeting? Oh, yes! Do you really want a meeting? - Oh, yes! - Let's just hear it then! - We want a meeting! - We want a meeting! - So let's have a meeting with Baby Family! - So let's have a meeting with Baby Family! - Ya, hey! - Ya, hey! - It's... - It's... - It's a morning meeting! - It's a morning meeting! Good morning, everyone! - Good morning, babies! - Morning! - How's everybody feeling today? - Good! How are sales going to be today? Even better! That's right, I've becomesomeone unfamiliar. Actually, I got to know MC King during my army days. I found out he often used MCs to excuse himself to take part in MLM. So I tagged along. However, I worked harder than him and secured more deals than him. And now, I'm more successful than he is. Back then, I was really a failure. I lost Qing Qing and Mom. So I told myself that I had to stop being so muddleheaded and lacking like I was before. I told myself that I must change. Nonsense! These elders here spent their lifetimes working painstakingly and finally got their pension. But because of your nonsensical words, they spent all of their savings to purchase your products. In the end, they couldn't sell the products and jeopardized their health. Who is she? Qing Qing! What are you doing here? I've never thought we would meet under such circumstances. Thank you. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't know about these black sheep in my company. You have to voice out what's wrong. So many years have passed and you still say the same line. You really haven't changed. How is that so? You didn't recognize me at once just now. Honestly, where have you been these past few years? Nothing much. I went to university for a year. They didn't allow me to take up English Literature and Chinese Literature at the same time. I thought it was unfair. So I packed my bags and left. It wasn't until my aunt passed away that I came back. Then, one day at a pub while drinking, I saved a suicidal boy by chance. It felt nice. So I decided to do social work. Wow, life has been so eventful for you recently. What else? We can stop talking about me. Let's talk about you instead. You've really changed. I didn't recognize you earlier on. Well, to be frank, I noticed a change in myself too. What about it? I think I've become a lot more dashing. You've just become smug. - Is it okay? - Yes, looks good. Do you still hold on to this? - Yes. - I haven't drawn for a very long time. Now? Yes. I'll give it a shot. Is this acceptable? Yes. If I... ask you to be my girlfriend, what would you say? If we really get together, I'm afraid one day, we would still break up. It'll be fine if we don't. We can be together forever. I've missed out on you too many times. I don't want to do it again. Give me a chance. Trust me. I'm sorry. We can't do this. Why not? There has to be a reason, right? After these few days, don't you think we're a good match? I'm married. You're married? One day, I returned home to find the door ajar. I thought, perhaps Yamamoto is finally back. But when I went in, I found... Yamamoto and his ex-girlfriend in bed. In our bed! I came back this time. I just wanted us to take a break for a while to think things through. I never thought I would meet you! I'm sorry. I should've told you earlier. I'm sorry. Almost You were almost my woman Just a little more And it could have been perfect But at the right time I missed the right person Unable to hold onto happiness The SARS situation continuesto worsen. Following Hong Kong and Taiwan, the first death due to SARS has been reported in Singapore. According to sources, the patient is the dad of the first SARS patient in Singapore. You asked my clinic to do a check on your new goods. There really are banned substances inside, you know? Over there! Mr. Lin! - Explain, Mr. Lin! - Mr. Lin! Why haven't people recovered from SARS after eating our pills? Exactly, they are demanding a refund! - What about our money? - Explain or we'll report it to the police! Hey, after eating your pills, my dad is now in the ICU! - Explain! Return us our money! - Explain! Return us our money! Okay! Relax, okay? I believe the SARS situation will be in control soon. Trust me, we're all part of Baby Family. Baby Family! Remember? Baby Family? More like Despicable Family! Yes, you took our hard-earned money! To get that money, I saved up bit by bit excruciatingly. Only to spend all of it on your pills. Now, I'm broke! After eating your pills, my sister is now in the ICU! You're better off dead! Better off dead! Return us our money! You said I would slim down after eating your pills, but I didn't. My pregnant wife took your pills and is now in the ICU! I'll curse your wife to get admitted to the ICU too! You despicable, lowly man! - Return us our money! Jerk! - Return us our money! Jerk! Hey! Did all of you have so much to say when you earned money? Ma'am, when you were earning money, you worshiped and thanked me. Telling me you no longer save up to play mahjong. You can even play DOTA. What about you? Before you joined us, you couldn't afford your meals. After you joined us, you have delicious buffets every day. Are you blaming me now? Make it clear. Is it your dad, sister, or wife in the ICU? Hey, my entire family ate your pills. Now all of them are in the ICU. Do you want me to be in the ICU too? It's all your fault. Stop talking and pay up! Hold on! Who are you? I've never seen you before. You're not our member. I'm the nurse in charge of the ICU his family members are in. I can't bear to watch a scumbag like you cheating him of his money! So I'm here to support him! Don't worry. If your wife doesn't make it, you still have me. Look, it's your fault! You caused this! Explain and pay up! - Explain! Return us our money! - Explain! Return us our money! Okay! I'm not demanding any credit from all of you right now. But you have to give me some time! Don't tell him so much. Just beat him up until he pays up! - Beat him up until he pays up! - You ungrateful dog! Whack him! Pay up! How dare you sell me fake pills! - You have two days to return us our money! - Return us our money! RETURN THE MONEY YOU OWE OR YOUR FAMILY WILL BE KILLED! DISTRIBUTORS ARE SUING BABY HEALTH SUPPLEMENTS CO. HEALTH SUPPLEMENTS KILL! Hey, why aren't you picking up calls? Everyone's looking for you! Talk to me if you have any problems. My mom is a lawyer, remember? She can help you for sure. Hey! If you want to jump down, go ahead. If not, come down right now! Fine, I'll jump down right now! You don't like me at all anyway! What did you say? When did I say that? You think I caused Mom's death! Dad. Ever since she passed away, you've been hostile to me! You think I caused your wife's death! I'll avenge your wife by jumping now! Are you happy? Yes! I brought up a son who wants to kill himself. I'm so happy! How about this? I'll jump with you. The more the merrier. Your mom's already dead. If you jump and leave your sister and me behind, do you have the heart to do that? You said you caused your mom's death. But in actual fact, the one who did that was me. Hey, Zhi! What are you doing here? The reason why you're here is the reason why I'm here. Quick, start the car. Or else, we won't make it in time! Hey, listen to me. About Lin Yu... Chong! He has already grown up. It's time to let go. You can watch over him now, but you can't do that forever. Listen to me. Forget it, just let him go. Back then, she didn't allow you to go to Kuala Lumpur. I disagreed with her and even persuaded her to let you go. I encouraged you to go and even supported you by giving you money. In the end, she became overly anxious and distracted. That's why she got hit by a car. It's not that I don't like you. But every time I see you, I get reminded of your mom. I resent myself so much and I feel so guilty, do you know? Dad. I'm sorry. It's my fault. Ever since I was young, for everything I wanted, no matter how hard I worked, I couldn't get them. Be it studies, exams, football, or girls. No matter what I do, I'm always lacking. I tried hard to change these few years and put in so much effort when working to try to make up for my lacking and to prove myself. Finally, I see some results. But now? A battle with SARS. A few black sheep in my company. I lost everything in just one night. You're already very hardworking and brave, do you know that? But in the end, I realized hard work can't make up for my lacking. It can't make up for my bad luck. Don't you remember? I was unlucky ever since I was born. Stop being so superstitious, will you? Attitude determines a person's success. Morality determines a person's fate. If you face an obstacle, overcome it. Your company collapsed? Then start over again. Your girl ran away? Then chase her again. Can I really start over? Can I really still do that and stand up again? Of course. It all depends on whether you want to do it. We're all born to await our deaths. Why are you so anxious? Just accompany me and live happily until our time comes, okay? DA JIE, INCOMING CALL Who knew that a light pat from Dad could almost kill me? If he really killed me, then Da Jie was the accomplice. Where are you? I heard you want to commit suicide. I'm warning you! Don't be reckless! My life is reallyfull of "almosts." But this time, I actually survived because I almost died. Seems like being lacking isn't necessarily bad. Lin Yu. Are you awake? Who are you? I'm Wan Wen. Wan Wen? You're Wan Wen? Are you feeling better? Don't worry, Dad. Lin Yu will be fine. I received Qing Qing'scall afterward. I'm living blissfullywith Yamamoto, so you must live well too. I think it's time to think about my future as well. Happy birthday, brother! Yu Mei and I are going to Vietnam for our honeymoon. You're there, refusing to get married. How about I get you a "honey"? What's your ideal type? I did some research. Da Jie's proposal to buy you a wife. According to my Law of Probability, it might actually work. I've already sent you the details about brides from different countries. Remember to take a look. Having almost died, I no longer lament about my lacking. So I found a day job by teaching children drawing. At night, I would help Dad man the bookstore. Unfortunately, the bookstore only got smaller under my care. Sir, do you sell The Avengers comics? Like, the one with Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, and Thor! That one! We don't have. However, I have the Chinese version of The Avengers! - The Chinese version of The Avengers? - Is there such a thing? Yes! It's called Feng Shen Bang. In English, Feng Shen Bang. Wait, I'll find it for you. Here. If you're bad at Chinese, it's okay. It's full of illustrations. It's very easy to understand. Inside, we have Lei Zhen Zi. Just like Thor, with thunder powers! And we have Ju Ling Shen as well, who is more powerful and more handsome than that green-colored... Ah Hock! It's so outdated. Let's go. Outdated? Dad, the Chinese version of The Avengers? It's the same. That's so exaggerating. Hey, I'm going back first. Remember to lock up. Okay, go to bed early. Okay. Although we never ended up together, I'm still happy for Qing Qing because she finally became free like a fish. When I grow up, I want to be like these fish, swimming freely. That must be really happy. If I were to become a fish, what are you going to be when you grow up? - I'll be the person that feeds the fish. - Why? When you're tired and hungry from swimming, I'll feed you. Then you can continue swimming and be happy. Are you still drawing? Did you forget? Oh no, I forgot! Just give me a while to pack up and I'll be ready to go. Sorry, we can go now. Hey, De Wei. Could you help to lock my shop up later? - Sure. - Thank you. At around 4:05 p.m. today, Mas Selamat escaped from the Detention Center he was held in. He had requestedto go to the toilet when his family was visiting and used this chance to escape. The police have conducted a massive manhunt. Hey, you picked a pretty decent spot. Thank goodness the weather's good for a picnic. Yes. Quick, dig in. These are your favorites. I can't. I'll get fat if I eat these. You eat them instead. Here. - Are they good? - Yes. - Here, have more. - Hey! If I eat like this, I'll be even fatter than you were. That's better than me being fat. - Here, have more. - Okay. I'll help myself to it. It's best to come here on a Sunday. No one will be here for sure. Yes. Hello. Today, we suspect a very dangerous and wanted person, crossing from here to Johor. So if you see anything, anyone, anything, anything at all that's suspicious, you let us know, okay? Yes, sir. - Sir! - Yes? Why do you give me balloons? Marry me. So are these yours? No. Are these yours or not? - No. - Are you sure these are not yours? - Yes! - Standby! Standby! There's somebody! Yes! Da Jie? Ray? - Stand down. - What are you guys doing here? - Do you guys know each other? - We're friends. So are these yours or not? - No. - Yes. Yes. - Sir! - Yes? Maybe it's a bomb. Take! Standby! - No! - Go! - No, wait! - Wait! Come back. No, this isn't a bomb. Yes, these are ours. Okay, anyway, this place is very dangerous. So quickly propose to her. In fact, get married straight away. Get the HDB flat, they're very expensive. So get the flat straightaway and then get children straightaway! Four children! Or five! Lucky, what are you eating? Lucky, don't eat the... Lucky! Lin Yu. Did you prepare all of these? No, I didn't. You did! Stop lying. You said it's romantic to have a picnic here. Furthermore, no one will come on a Sunday, so it's perfect to propose. I said no one will come. But when did I mention proposing? You did! If you don't believe me, you can ask Ray. Maybe. Must be. He's embarrassed, that's why. Why are you embarrassed too? Stop singing the tune. Well, what are you waiting for? Wan Wen. I'm sorry. I really can't bring myself to propose. I really thought we could be together. - I'm sorry. I... - You don't have to say anything else. I understand. Yes, don't say anything. Hey, dig in. Eat them while they're still warm. I'm very full! Why did you do that? It was the perfect setup and you wasted it! Wasted! I finally understood. Turns out what's lousyisn't my luck, but me. Hurting Wan Wen was the lousiest thing I've done in my life. So, I no longer expect someoneto love me. The only thing I can do is to keep a safe distance and watch the person I lovefrom afar. Wan Wen got married. I heard that her husband is one of the top invisible tycoons in Singapore. That's right. To think that we've only broken up for half a year. Why? Are you regretting it? Too late, my friend. Thank goodness Wan Wen got married off well. If not, I would never forgive you. Hey. I'm honestly really guilty of that. I'm just teasing you. Wan Wen's happy right now. So you can stop blaming yourself. What about you? How are you doing? You like men! No, that's not it. I'm actually on dates with a few female colleagues currently. Not one but a few. Impressive. Stop talking about me. What are you up to? OFFLINE, QING QING - Lin Yu. - Dad. You're up until late working every night. Don't tire yourself out. Here. Drink more water. It's good for your body. Thank you, Dad. No problem. Breaking news! Yamamoto cheatedon Qing Qing again! I knew it. He's a jerk. The probability of cheating on one's partner again is 78.23161%. I bet Qing Qing must bevery sad now. Really? Qing Qing didn't tell me anything. Does she tell you everything? Did she tell you how many times she pooped yesterday? Darling. Come over now, please. The candles are lit. It's my birthday today! I'm busy now. Stop bothering me! Let's do that later. Come, use mine. Thank you. Whenever I see children in the class, I can't help but think of the past. Maybe Qing Qing isn't as strong as I thought. Perhaps she was always hiding in her own world, afraid of being hurt. All of a sudden, I realized that we were both wasting time. Why couldn't I tell that Qing Qing was unhappy all along? I'm divorced, but... Please don't worry about me. After receiving the news of her divorce, I made a decision. Dad! Alvin! Let me carry you. You naughty boy. You called your uncle "Dad." It's fine. I'm his godfather, so that counts as half a dad, right? I've told you that you can't keep calling your uncle "Dad." What if your uncle's girlfriend hears it when we're in Japan? She would think your uncle has gotten married. If she runs away, your uncle will be all alone. Then it will be your fault! Let's go. Let's go overseas. Did you bring everything? Yes. What a shame. Qing Qing has already left. She eventually chose to be that fish who could swim freely. All along You are my destined lover I'll stand by you wholeheartedly Even if you haven't accepted me When the timing isn't right, it's not right. Even though we were able to get connected through the Internet, we have grown apart. FATAL CAR ACCIDENT There was a fatal accident this morning at Tampines. A middle-aged lady was hit by a lorry while going home. She died on the spot. Whenever there is a news report on traffic accidents, Dad always has this expression. I know that he's thinking of Mom again. I came to realize that my parents had true love. They shared a life together and ultimately, separated. This sense of longing is real and lasting. In contrast, the supposed love between me and Qing Qing is just full of missed chances. I should learn how to move on without Qing Qing in my life. But I know, I'll still quietly wait for her. Lin Yu always says he missed out on me. To be honest, the one who truly missed out was me. I missed out on Lin Yu. Ever since we were young, I've always assumed we were just good friends. Thinking back, ever since we first met, Lin Yu has always been looking at me like this. He really likes me. Please be more serious. I could see flashes of red and even the lace lining! Lace! Seriously! Every single time, repeatedly, because of the wrong people and the wrong time, Lin Yu and I missed out on chances to be together. I finally understand that it turns out, the one who missed out wasn't Lin Yu, but me. After Yamamoto and I signed our divorce papers, without Lin Yu's comics, I can't imagine how I was going to pull through that darkest period of my life. - Thank you so much! - No worries. - Have a nice day. - You too! He didn't know that I made a rash decision to come back two years agoto find him. Dad! Alvin! Let me carry you. Lin Yu finally found happiness. I can't destroy it for my own selfish desires. It is said that there aretwo types of women in the world. Those who are being loved and thosewho are waiting for love. Right now, I am neither. Come back when you're free. Darling, why haven't you visited for so long? You've got the wrong person. - Darling, come on in. - I've never been here before. Hello, Mei Ling? Is Dad ready? Okay, I'll pick him up after my class gathering. Okay. I bought the Minions toys for Alvin. They are inside Dad's bag. You have to wait for him to finish eating. Okay? Okay, bye. Hey! Today, I came back to this place. The place wherel first met Lin Yu. I contemplated long before deciding to come back for the class reunion. I really miss Lin Yu. But I'm not hereto disrupt his happiness. I just want to wish himthe very best in person. There will no longerbe missed chances between us. Hey, girl! Wan Wen! Long time no see. Qing Qing! Da Jie! - Ray. - Qing Qing. How are you guys? Didn't you say that you were going to Mongolia - to volunteer and not coming back? - I came back earlier for you guys. Where is Yu Mei? She's parking the car. Guess what, she forced me to buy her a car once she got her license. It has only been her driving the car so far. The COE is so expensive! Hey, stop running! Give me back my case! Where is Lin Yu? I have no idea. There wasn't anyone in the shop when I came in. The probability of him leaving the shop empty is less than 0.1%. Maybe he has gone to buy some things. Right, what about his wife and son? Wife? When did he get married? Why were we not invited? But I saw a boy who called him "Dad." That boy's name is Alvin. It's his nephew. Alvin calls him "Dad" frequently and calls me "Mom" sometimes too. The probability of Lin Yu waiting for you is 99.999999999%. Let's not waste time guessing. Just ask the neighbors. Hello, beauty. May I know... Honey, come on in and read some books. Just reading books? Come on! There is always beauty within the books. Oh, really? I like it! Beauty within the books. Would you like a penthouse within the books too? - So you can keep your mistress? - It hurts! I mean, I was just asking her about Lin Yu's whereabouts. Ask her if you don't believe me. Mr. Lin? It seems like he went to catch a thief. Catching a thief? Are you crazy? This is very dangerous! Were you risking your life over this notebook? You can always draw again. You can't draw if the memory is gone. Loneliness grows in the mind Planting seeds of sadness Don't let the stars come and pry Find a silent night Find a silent night Don't let stars come and pry Planting seeds of sadness Loneliness grows in the mind The way I care Is something you can't detect Only when you're unaware Can I lock up my heart Your usual friendliness Is my current regret I don't show it on my face Even after getting hurt They are finally together. I feel like crying all of a sudden. Be a man. Don't make me cry. My head hurts so much. I want to cry as well. How did you change so quickly? Of course, or should I let them recognize me instead? Wow, you're so professional. That was so accurate. Just give it to me. Your friend hits really hard. Sorry. Luckily, you conned Qing Qing back for the class reunion. Of course! They keep taking turns missing out on each other. They always tell others about their stories. I don't even know if anyone is listening. If I don't help them, they will go crazy one day. You'd better keep this a secret from everyone. Especially my wife! I got it. Are they still kissing? Of course, after years of holding back, they are making up for lost time now.
