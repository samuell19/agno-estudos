THIS FILM DOES NOT REFERENCE ANY ACTUAL RELIGION, GROUP OR PERSON ANY SIMILARITIES ARE COINCIDENTAL In the isolated hilltop mansion of the Vuong Dinh family, five people were murdered based on the Five Elements: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth. The suspect, Vu Ha Phuong, was arrested during her final kill. She is the mansion's owner. All the victims were her relatives. Early findings revealed she was performing a ritual for a higher power called "The Divine." Hello, Mistress. What a great mother you are. To protect your own son, you would willfully smash another son's head, then take the blame and spend the rest of your life here. Mistress… Do you remember all that had happened? VUONG DINH MANSION My first two children, they were girls. A great sin. My mother-in-law said The Divine told her that if two women were pregnant together, the Vuong Dinh family's chances of having a son would rise! Mercy, The Divine! My daughter-in-law has gravely sinned: birthing daughters, twice! We've thus transgressed! Is it true that having a son, will end all the pain, Mother? Forgive us, The Divine! Have mercy! Please grant the Vuong Dinh family a son as a child… to extend our lineage, so we can continue serving you! More oxytocin for her! We're out of time! The child is born! A boy… or a girl? A boy! Praise The Divine for conceiving us! Praise the shifting Five Elements that forever keep the family prosperous, yin and yang balanced, and our ancestors' Nine Commandments fully upheld! We willingly offer our flesh and spirit to you. Greetings, listeners! Here is your essential news of the day. It's 3:40 p.m., Friday, December 23, 1999. This afternoon will see a tropical depression, with light to moderate rain. Unless necessary, everyone should stay at home and keep doors closed. We're about to enter a new era, a new era of faith! Choose to hear only crucial information don't panic, and don't trust others so easily! The reason being, quite recently, a long-disbanded religious group is seeing new members rebuilding a cult that once caused many painful events. Be selective with what you believe, for not everyone speaks the truth. Vinh An! Auntie. The prodigal son has at last found his way home! So, bored of adventuring, kiddo? I've returned to visit Mother. And everyone. Surely everyone is dying to see you at dinner, but I won't be there. Auntie has an appointment. See you later! Mistress expects everyone to eat dinner, ma'am. You're certain her "everyone" … also includes me? Yes, ma'am. That means you're included, but not the bouquet. Can the bouquet go instead of me? No, ma'am. The Mistress awaits, sir. Yes. Is the US pretty, big brother? An's home, he's home, little brother's home! Mother. Dear Mother, I'm home. Home is good. From this moment, Vinh An will replace me as the head of the Vuong Dinh family. Mother… VUONG DINH MANSION Your son was born in the Fire Hour. Beneath the Harming Star. His future is blood-drenched. An early death! Save him, please, Mother. Please ask The Divine to save my son. He can't die young! I beg you… The other wife, Hong, knows how to give birth, unlike you! Her son came out just half a moment before, yet his Hour is Water, and his Star, Knowledge. His whole life is blessed by The Divine! A destiny befitting an heir. For you to save your son, you must fully trust The Divine's protection! Serving The Divine is not just a task, it is a life that you must live! For the sake of this family's true heir, the eldest son of the eldest son, against my will I'll do a ritual to change their fates! My son, who's older, shall live life in peace. This son, who's younger, shall face storms and waves. He must never enter the Altar Room, not even half a step! It's been so long since Vinh An was home so may we skip the kooky-spooky prayer tonight, big sis? Why are your words so blasphemous? This house's traditions, regardless of who leaves or returns, must never change. Without any change soon, there'll be more leaving and less returning. Praise The Divine for conceiving us! Praise the shifting Five Elements that forever keep the family prosperous, yin and yang balanced, and our ancestors' Nine Commandments fully upheld! We willingly offer our flesh and spirit to you. Done! Let's toast! And eat while it's hot! Go ahead and eat, everyone. All those years studying abroad, so used to eating whatever you like, now returning for this grand family meal… Must feel confining, huh? Confining or not, he's family. Nothing will ever change that. Eat properly. Mother will scold you. I'm so hungry. - Mrs. Hue. - Yes, ma'am? Take Little Dong to the back and get him some rice. I feel bad that he's hungry. Yes, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am. Little Dong is so sweet, just like Vinh An when he was young. No, sis. To me, the younger kid is the sweet one. Vinh An is just lucky to be healthy to then hop and skip in all directions. As for Thai Phong, he sits where you seat him. As kids, the brothers were very close. Simply thick as thieves. Every day chasing each other everywhere. Then when they grew up, one can still run about, the other always stays put. Auntie… Eat more, Thai Phong. In this house, you're my only joy. Your Auntie loves you. Silence. Vinh An! I almost didn't recognize you earlier. You've changed so much. But had Thai Phong been the one studying abroad, then no matter how far he'd gone, I'd still know him. Know something, big sis? He looks just like his father. Identical. But his personality is his mom's... I mean yours, sis. She's coming! She's coming! Who? What guest would come at this hour? The nanny! She's scary! She's all bloody and muddy! Handling a dead body is easier than a live one, big sis. Shut up! Stop talking! Stop looking! Shut up! Stop talking! What is nanny saying? She says… Revenge! Just eat. Eat. Whomever accidentally killed her, she's looking for you. What do you want? Can you shut up? The Divine will punish us all. Do you want to see this family perish? Dearest sister… As a true member of this family, I say The Divine will not punish anyone. Only people do that… to other people. Can't swallow this family meal. Strangers are more of a treat. Bon appetit, all. Mrs. Hue! Mrs. Hue! - Mother! - Mother! - Mother! - Mother! Mother! Mrs. Hue… why is there lily pollen here? Mother! Breathe with your mouth. Breathe with mouth! The Mistress' allergy pills! I promise no one will make you sad anymore, big sister. Sound good? In this house, only Phong cares about me. That's not true. Everyone cares. No… No one cares, because I'm a girl. But how come Phong is a boy, but Mother also hates you? Mother is a bad person, right? Mother is good. My sister is so good. You look cuter with a smile. Smile, now! One, two, three! That was the last photo of the sister, Vong Nam. The Metal Death… Sister. Give it back! You can't play with this. It will hurt you. You're a bad person! Bad! You have to die! Swear to me, husband… Did The Divine arrange it? I swear! If I did cheat on you, The Divine would punish me. I would die instantly. Do you believe me now? O, mercy, The Divine! O, mercy, The Divine! O, mercy, The Divine! Mistress hasn't entered this room for a long time. So where is my Mother now? Have you checked the Altar Room? When you went abroad, many events occurred in this house. People found a body in the lake down the slope. It was the nanny who worked here. She had no relatives. No one claimed her. Perhaps it was an unjust death, since she returns and weeps nightly. Out of fear, all the other servants have left. Only Mr. Tuan and I stay behind. But… We're used to it now. Every night, Mistress will go to a place and perform a ritual to restrain the spirit. I don't believe in these ghost stories. People often believe in lies, over hard truths. Come in. Some tea, Mother. The tea is fragrant and bitter. Mother… I'm carving spirit tablets for myself, and everyone in the family. Mother, I'll return home, just not now. How long will you keep avoiding it? Big sister will do well, Mother. Daughters are outsiders! Only sons, or the eldest son of the eldest son, can assume the role to prolong this family's glory. You must believe in The Divine! Do not wrap yourself in fear! You mean you've never been afraid? Never. Because The Divine watches over us all. If we're protected by The Divine, then why is my sister Vong Nam like that, huh, Mother? Had she been a boy at birth, no one in this family would be sick! I will help her in my own way. I've tried everything! You can't force people to live in your beliefs. Serving The Divine is not just a task… It is a life that you must live. I can feel it very close by… What is, Mother? Death! Mother… Mother, I'm so sorry, please don't cut my hair! Forgive me, Mother! I'm sorry! Must not be a girl, to balance yin and yang. To balance yin and yang, be a boy… Must not be a girl. Must not… Balance yin and yang. Be a boy. Must be a boy. Must be a boy! Or else die, die, die! Mother, don't cry… Don't cry anymore. It's my fault. It's my fault. Mother… Don't cry, Mother. Don't cry, Mother. Hey, big sis? How can you call this "taking care of the grounds"? Being the matriarch is not one-and-done work. That is why this key never leaves my hand. You call this thing a key? It's more like a needle, the very thing you use to keep all of our mouths shut. But don't mistake that you're seeing earned smiles… For behind those sealed lips are secrets forced to be kept down. Let them be so for too long and folks might hurl them into your face! Oh, wait, sis… But I've been so good! All those years I've said nothing! I'm so good I didn't say sh... The secret will remain a secret, when only one person is left standing. Sister! In all my years living with you, I still don't get why, despite not being of the same bloodline, every time… I get a close look at you, I feel that we're so very close. Do you know why? Because you look just like Mom! You're a snake! Shut up! Mr. Tuan. Call the police! No! She was punished by The Divine! White beans! Bleeding stomach! Scratched ring finger! All signs of… drained Metal Element. It's not, Mother! Only The Divine's power can pierce flesh with just a chain. Mother! - Mr. Tuan? - Ma'am? Bring her to the Altar Room. I said no calls! Kim Thien. Mother…? How many months? It's… I'm asking, how long have you been pregnant? It's… five months… Boy or girl? Well… A girl. A daughter for a daughter. I am so sorry… for how I've treated you, Vong Nam! I thought that by absorbing spells, I could give birth to you as a son. But why weren't you a boy? Why is that, Vong Nam? I have tried my best. I always want the happiness of this family to be whole. So why does life treat me like this? For, if the family's heir is an outsider, the Vuong Dinh family will be punished. The ritual to alter fate is something I have to do. Doing it means you must give something up! Sometimes it's your very own blood! To perform the ritual is to defy Heaven's will. Not only must you endure physical pain, you will also bear the guilt that crushes your heart, and will live in solitude for the rest of your days. Any negligence at all, and The Divine shall unleash The Five Elemental Deaths. And those five deaths will be a part of your existence. How come none of my wishes are coming true? Why is that? Mistress! Why are you around this late? I was looking for Little Dong. He's gone somewhere, but then I heard... Nanny! Nanny! Nanny! Nanny, where are you? Nanny! Nanny! Nanny! Don't leave me alone! Nanny! Nanny! Nanny! No! Nanny! No! No! No…! No! Nanny! I promise to protect you, little brother. I will never leave you alone, Phong. Died on a tree… Square sigil on her forehead… Green beans… This is the Wood Death. Mr. Tuan… Bring her to the Altar Room. Mother? We must call the police. Mother… Mother! Two people have died! If we don't call the police now, the next person could be me. Or you! That was divine punishment! I'm sorry… but all that's happened is no accident. You know that, right? I do! That is why the thing we must do now is to pray to The Divine for forgiveness! Fine… I'll pray as well! But I'll still call the police, Mother. If the dead are buried too late, it will affect our fortune. Mother… You can't! I forbid you! Mrs. Dao died on a tree. First Metal, then Wood. Next up is Water. The one with Water in this house, apart from Vinh An, is this cripple here. What did you say? You will not insult Thai Phong! Apologize to him, now! Insult, huh? If I call him "useless," "parasite," or "servant," those are insults. But saying he's a "cripple," that's a fact! Will you stop? Stop it now! This is your brother-in-law! "Brother-in-law"… And yet such language for his relatives? I share no blood with you. Whoever dies, dies. Won't be me. Phong! Phong! Stop! Please! He… We didn't mean anything, Phong! Phong! The wound isn't so deep. I'm alright. Can you stop hurting yourself, please? Not every wound bleeds, yet all of them leave scars. They remind me that I exist. I'll take you to the US to heal your legs. Tomorrow, can you take me out? If he's right about me being next, then that is my last wish. We'll go tomorrow. But you stop thinking like that. Nothing bad will happen. Exactly at midnight tomorrow, we bury the bodies. Don't be late. No need to rest them in coffins. Let the corpses meet the roots. Easier for them to move on. Ma'am. Mother! Let me go too. I'd like to help bury them. You should return to the US. If anything happens, you're the last hope of the Vuong Dinh family. And what about you? There are two bruises. The larger one is lighter, so she was strangled by a rope smaller than a vine. The legs are scarred. And covered in mud. She might have died at the bottom of the slope. I have barred you from returning. Why are you here then? Can you let me meet Thai Phong, please? How is my son nowadays? "My son"? Since when is Thai Phong your son? Are you admitting that you stole someone else's husband? Yes. I took him from you. You wicked bitch. I'm a dishonest woman. Now will you let me see my child? Silence! I'm begging you! Before you say that, why not take a look at yourself? I have kept my promise! For 18 years, I haven't heard his voice calling out for mom. Please let me know then… I must be away from him until when? Forever! No wonder… He loved me more than you! He told me himself, due to fear of The Divine, there must be a son to balance yin and yang. You were stupid enough to believe his words? Yes! Because I was stupid… I pretend not to know that you were my husband's mistress! Because I was stupid, when my mother-in-law and my husband brought Thai Phong home with you as his nanny… I agreed, willingly! Because I was stupid, I live in misery and act like I'm happy! But because I'm not happy, no one will get to be. Not even you, and so you won't see Thai Phong until you die. But don't worry… I'll take good care of him. You're a snake! Give me back my child! Give me back my child! Give me back my child! Give him back! Help! Help! Help who? Just wait a bit longer. So it's certain. Handling a dead body is easier than a live one, big sis. It was my little sister who you pushed into the lake. She was the floating, rotting corpse that when it was lifted out was in tatters because fish after fish had feasted on it day after day. - I didn't mean to... - Shh! She had died, but you'd still torment her every night. Her remains… You still had them in shackles for seven years. Why did you hate her? My sister and the Master… knew each other, loved each other… before his mother forced him to make you his wife. Therefore… my sister and I had to hide our identities as siblings. Otherwise… how could I survive in the house for long? Long enough… until the day… I got to see you here. That tea I brewed for you each night… Tasty? The water for it… I took from the lake down the slope. That bitterness on the tip of your tongue… That would be what was left of your sins still there beneath the lake. Your crime was not killing people… It was choosing to follow evil. You made me do this. Don't blame me. Nanny! Nanny! May I borrow the car for a day? If you can fix it. Little Dong is so good! Here, for you. Thank you! But Uncle Phong, why did Uncle Vinh An want to call the police? To catch bad people. Who are the bad people? Is this yours, Uncle? Yes! Thank you, kiddo. Seven years! I waited seven years for someone to take me out of the house. Seven years ago, also at this very slope… I don't blame you, brother. On that day, from the bottom of the pit, I got to see a beautiful sunset. A blazing red sky. People say the sunset is a gift from the Heavens for patient souls. Let's wait for one before we return, if that's alright? Could you grab my camera, please? Phong! Phong! I told you, the Water Death would be the cripple. You be quiet! Do you want a bloodbath that much? I'm only telling the truth. The more deaths there are… the less we have to share. The truth is that you haven't done shit for this family. So shut your mouth. What did you say? Have you gone deaf? Stop! I dare you to take one more step! If you choose to drive out of those gates, you won't come back alive. The Divine will punish you with the Fire Death! I shouldn't have taken you outside… Were you scared back then? Back when? When I left you in the pit. Phong! I'm sorry. Mr. Tuan, let me drive. Your Mother has given her orders. Please don't make it difficult for me. We… can still get to the police station in time. Are you afraid of my Mother… or The Divine's punishment? I've lived in this house for a long time. If you trust me… it'd be best to obey the Mistress. You do love your Mother, right? When a victim is strangled, they will grab onto the rope out of instinct. Why did Auntie scratch her thigh then? Mother. Mother! Who brought lilies into the Altar Room? Vinh An! Stop the car! You take Mother to the hospital first. I'll take care of myself! Go, go! EMERGENCY I want to carve your heart out and ask it, "What should I do now?" In this house, only Phong cares about me. I promise no one will make you sad anymore, big sister. I also loved you the most in this house, Auntie! I have missed so many opportunities… This is the last one. I will count to three, and if you can get up and run to the door, I will spare your life. One… Two… Three! It's you. Thai Phong! Yes? I've come to visit Mother. Because of that… you can walk like normal? I just wanted to surprise everyone. I thought if Mother saw me walking fine, she would recover faster. Are you disturbed that I'm well and on my own two feet? Your legs have healed. You could have studied abroad. Why choose to ditch your future and torment me for seven years? You hate me that much? Do you know… how terrible it's been to feel that I maimed my younger brother? I like that feeling. The important thing is not that you crippled me, but that you abandoned me. Why not just kill me then? How are the others at fault? But I didn't do anything. Many times I've tried to leave the thought out of my head. I had hoped that you weren't the culprit. But it was you… You planned everything. You used the anesthetic Lidocaine and the vasoconstrictor Epinephrine to hinder the pain when you stabbed your thigh. You also injected Botulinum Toxin for a long time so your legs would atrophy like a disabled person's. Did I miss anything, Phong? Why did you kill Auntie Anh Dao? Because she was so loud. And big sister, Vong Nam? Didn't you find her miserable? I only saved her. What about Mother? She was our Mother, Phong! You still believe that you and I share the same Mother? Look at me now. Do you see yourself there? This is a hospital. No more fear, or cowardice, or running! The US must be pretty, right? I also want to go. But then you've used my legs, stolen my dream, and crushed my life! Come back and be my brother, Phong. I'll come back tomorrow! But there will be no tomorrow… since the Phong you needed is long dead! Did you remember your promise to me? You said you'd never abandon me, that you'd forever protect me, and never leave me alone! So why did you do it anyway? We're looking for suspects linked to the murders at the Vuong Dinh domain. It was me. No further investigation needed. Please come with us to the station for further questioning. Everyone makes mistakes, and this is me atoning for mine. I'll take good care of Mother. Stop! Stop! Suspect's escaping! Surround the hospital now! HONG AN HOSPITAL She returned to exact revenge on me. She just would not forgive me. Mother… We owed Thai Phong too much. It was all his doing. Thai Phong! Hurry and say goodbye to Thien Kim, big brother! Phong! What did he say… huh? I have to check on my eldest sister! You hold onto the phone, stay here… and wait for me. Be careful! Vinh An! Be careful! Please be careful! Fingerprints on the carving knife and all other evidence is all of Vinh An and Mistress Phuong… Who should take the fall is up to you. As your Aunt, I won't allow you to hesitate. If you don't believe, how can The Divine see you? That is the life that you must live. Lies! Betrayal! All those years… I've lived with my own faith… but all of you… have lied to me, have betrayed me! I don't feel all that comfortable… No! Stop! Please spare me, Thai Phong. Thai Phong, spare my girl, please… Big sister, tell me who deserves to die the most? Let me know… who deserves to die the most? Who is the one that has to die? No one! No one, I beg you! You have no right to choose who lives or dies! So I was wrong then? This certain game will end… when the person who must meet death… perishes. Give Thai Phong a call. He wants you to meet. To settle everything. Lend me your phone. I love this feeling! Where is Mother? Where is she? Do you know what the scariest thing in the past seven years was? It was seeing how one day after another would turn me into a stranger. Now, bring my Mother's ashes to me. Then you and I, a Mother for a Mother. Stop! Stop now! Thank you, kid. That's all that we know. On the carving knife are fingerprints from you and Vinh An. If they deduce that you're not the killer, it will be him. This time, no one will save your beloved son. Three lives taken… Vinh An, how cruel you are, so is your Mother! If you let Vinh An go, Mother here will do whatever you want. Can you get my mother back? I used to want to kill you in the most painful, fearful manner. Do you know what I resent the most? That I can clearly remember your face, but not my own mother's! Your son robbed me of my life! Where's Mother? Tell me, where is she? Where's my mother? Try calling her… She has your phone, no? What are you doing, Phong? Oh, I forgot her in the trunk. You killed your mother! Do you get how it feels to see a loved one die before your eyes now? Idiot! Your mother isn't in the car! What have you done with mother? Mother! Mother! Phong! Where is my mother? Phong! Phong! Do you know how I feel now? Why did you… ruin my life? Why? The Vuong Dinh family needs only one son. And that's it! That's it! That's it! That's it! Vinh An! Mother… Do you love me? Do you love me, Mother? Can't even answer, you hag? No matter what you do, Vinh An will stay in jail until he rots. I'm sorry, son… From now until your death, every night before you sleep, do you think about Phong? Stop talking… Do you remember how he'd look at you? Stop it! Do you remember the gargling noise he made before he died? Yes! Yes! That's better. That means his death… was worthwhile. That means my actions more than 20 years ago matter after all. Thai Phong… was your biological son. I'm sorry. I made a mistake… Vinh An is waiting outside. Whether to tell him the truth or not, that's up to you, Mistress. Mother… You are… my true son! My mother's actual urn, where is it now? Obviously in the safest place possible. And sister Kim Thien? Already handled. You're sure that our hands stay clean, Auntie? Did we even do anything? Their family members hurt one another. Let's go home, Auntie. People often believe in lies over hard truths. So even when no one was looking, I'd still put on an act. I must believe in this angelic mask I wear, so that others will too.
