"KILL BARBARA WITH PANIC" The sky was dark when you first arrived, Barbara. You were happy and excited to see them again. Nothing like today, wherein doubt reigns upon you mind. Fathom your feelings, Barbara. Are you really happy to be back? Are you as excited to see them as last time? Are you back because of Ruth? Because of Karen? Or is it because of Fritz? Are you coming back because... ...of the feelings you conceal in your heart? I feel for you Ruth. I never had a chance to condole. In your moments of grief and abandonment. Aunt Babs (Barbara). Karen needs me, I have to go to her. Goodbye. Ruth. My sister, Ruth. You used to get a cold when it rains. Erlyn. Out of all the people who live in this house, You're the one who knows. Why Karen has acted differently towards her Father. What's the reason? I was already sleeping that night... I woke up and Karen's mom and dad were in a heated argument. Ruth, being my wife, you have a right to be jealous. But its not the right of a mother to destroy a father's honor in front of his child. If you were hurt by what I've said, then you should be hurt. Because what you are doing to us is no joke. There are nights when I didn't want to come home. And with what you're doing right now. There are moments when I never want to see you again. I know that I'm the biggest burden in your life. And I will help you solve your problem. If the spirit of Beatrice's cards failed to find your mistress... Then I will be the one to confront her. What my mortal body has failed to accomplish in this life... I will accomplish in the next life. I am prepared to take my life, Fritz. So that I can take back the happiness that you and your mistress took from me. Ruth, where are you going? I'm going to kill myself! What do you mean kill yourself? Why don't you come back to your mistress? Why are you so angry at me? It's none of your business. You bastard, you'll pay for this! Ruth! Let go of me! Ruth! For Karen's sake, stop this. I will stop when you tell me who your mistress is. I swear to you that I have no mistress. If what you're telling me is true... Then you should swear to Jesus Christ that you have no mistress. You should swear it to God, Fritz. Swear it. Swear it! I curse you! You bastard! You ghoul! You monster, you'll pay for this! You and your mistress should stick together! Ruth, open the door! Stop this foolishness! Ruth, open the door! Stop this foolishness, Ruth! You'll pay for this, Fritz. You'll pay. You and your mistress. You'll pay for this dearly. We took Mrs. Martinez to the hospital. But it was too late. And as she was lying on her death bed I saw an unusual look on her face because this is the first time in which I saw a person who is near her death who has nothing but words of anger and rage instead of repentance to God. You should be laughing. I am nearly dead. When I'm gone, no one will ever bother you. You and your mistress. You know what? I'm also happy. Because with my passing... In my next life, I'll know which woman you're crazy about. I swear, Fritz. I will never leave you in peace! I will never stop until I get revenge and take back the happiness that you took from me! I swear, Fritz! I swear! Mommy, don't leave me! Karen, my child. I'm going to be leaving you. This departure of mine doesn't mean that I'm going to abandon you. Mommy, don't leave me please. The doll, Karen! Give me the doll. Promise to me that you'll take care of it. Take good care of it. Take good care of the doll, my child. When you're with the doll, it will be almost as if I'm right beside you. My child, the doll... Ruth! Ruth, please. I have never wronged you. Don't persecute me like this. I was waiting for you inside. I was hoping that we could have breakfast together. But Aling Cedeng told me that you already had coffee. I'm not really big on breakfast, Fritz. I know that's not the real reason, Barbara. I know that you don't want to talk to me. And I don't know the reason why you're avoiding me. I'm not really avoiding you. It's just that... We really have nothing to talk about. It will take a long time before Karen forgets what happened to Ruth. Please don't leave us just yet, Barbara. Not until the Karen forgets about the loss of her Mother. I can't decide right away, Fritz. But whatever my decision may be... I decided it because I care about Karen's welfare. Maybe this is not the right moment to let you know how I feel, Barbara. But the fact that you have returned has saved me. So that I may have another reason to live. I never expected that my return will be for the death and burial of Ruth. I'm going to attend to Karen upstairs. I'm going to see if she's prepared for school. Ms. Esguerra. Go to the office this afternoon instead. I'm not going to be needing you right now. Ok, Mr. Martinez. I have to something to ask you. There is woman whom Ruth frequently visits. Back when she was still alive. Her name was... Beatrice. Do you know her? Yes, Ms Enriquez. From what I know... She was usually the reason for the fights between Mr. and Mrs. Martinez. This Beatrice that you're talking about, Ms. Esguerra Did Ruth find out from her the things that she wanted to know? Never. She never found out, Mr. Martinez. I never told her about the woman I saw through my cards. I also kept secret the gradual loss of your feelings for Ruth. I want to speak to you thoroughly, Beatrice. About what, Mr. Martinez? About Ruth. Are there other things that you have discussed with her? About (mumbles)? Nothing, Mr. Martinez. Before Ruth's death, did she tell you anything about Karen's doll? Do you need anything, Mr. Martinez? What? Do you need anything? Yes. Never mind, Ms. Gonzales. I'll just call for you later. You're already dead. Dead and buried. Buried in the ground. Covered with earth. You're already dead. How can the things that I have seen be real? How? If I was the one who was dead... and you were the one alive... and you saw me by your side... Would you believe that it was me? If you did know everything that is happening Then you would know the reason why I am this way. You would know that I love Barbara. And I see your disapproval in the face of the doll that you left for Karen. The things that I am seeing are not real. It is merely illusion. They are rooted in your false presumptions, that I have cheated on you! Ruth, I have never cheated on you! A man has a right to love, but that doesn't mean that I have cheated on you! And you have no right to impugn upon one's right to love. I love Barbara but I have never lost my love for you. It is not me whom you are avoiding. Not the past Or the present. But yourself. You are the one avoiding yourself, Barbara. You are avoiding the fulfillment of your own happiness. The happiness that needs to reside in our hearts, Barbara. You should never let your love pass away with Ruth's death. Ruth is already dead. And you are alive. And you should accept that fact. Ruth is dead. She's dead, Barbara! She's dead! Let me have that doll! It's my doll, you can't have it! It's my doll, you can't have it! Let me have my doll back! Give the doll to me Karen! I don't want to! Let me have my doll! I'm going to be leaving, Ruth. I am leaving to forget it all. Even our happy moments when we were still children. Do you still remember , Ruth? Do you still remember the happy moments we shared? When we were still children... The world was ours and no emotion could come between us. I really didn't want to talk about this thing anymore. But I want you to know that I don't agree with Father's last will and testament. What part of it do you not like? When your Mother died and your Father married my Mother, This house was already built. My mother invested in this house so that I can live in it when I get married. Father might have made the mistake of leaving you the rights to this house. But you know full and well that I am the one who has the rights to it. I know, Ruth. You deserved the house more than I did. Can you please go home? Ruth, what is it about? You have to go home right away, Barbara. I really need your help. What's troubling you? Barbara, it's about Fritz. I have a problem with Fritz. I think he's crazy about another woman. I don't know what to do. I can't... I can't... really help you with that problem. You need to come home, Barbara. I don't know what is going to happen to me. I may not be able to control myself. I don't know what I might do to him. I might lose my sanity. Only you and Fritz can solve that problem. Goodbye, Ruth. Forgive me. Forgive me for whatever it is that I might have done to you. Ms. Esguerra. I know that you are the only one who can understand the reason for my departure. But... do you really need to leave without informing Karen? Karen may be the only one who can stop me from leaving. I know that as long as I am here, Karen won't feel the importance of her Father's love. And staying here won't help heal Karen's resentment towards her Father. I had to tell her, Ms.Enriquez. It will only hurt her more if she found out that you have gone later. And that you will never return. You are the only one left to care for her. You know the reason why I need to leave. I don't know your reason! I don't know the reason why you need to leave. I don't know the reason why you need to be far from us. I don't know the reason why you have to avoid me, Barbara. Talking to me doesn't mean that you're betraying Ruth. We should talk about what is between us. You're wrong, Fritz. You've got it all wrong. Don't take this the wrong way, but I am leaving because of Karen. She is the only reason. What is important is for you to get Karen's love back. And that can only be accomplished when I'm gone. I don't believe you. You're just using Karen to hide your true feelings for me. What has happened to you? Do you not understand what is happening in this house? Do you not understand what Karen is feeling at this very moment? She already lost her Mother. But it's almost as if she's already lost his Father! But you're still alive and living with her in this house! Do you not understand? All you think about is your personal feelings towards me. As you slowly kill Karen's happiness in this house! I'm the one who needs to be understood, Barbara. Karen's love for me has been gone since Ruth died. And only your love can revive Karen's love for me. If you ever leave, Barbara... Our love and happiness will be gone from this house. Karen and my own. Let's go. I don't know the reason why you need to leave, Barbara. I don't know the reason why you have to go. I don't know the reason why you have to avoid me, Barbara! Barbara, the doll... the doll... Be careful. Be careful, Barbara. You're next. Be wary of the doll, Barbara. You're next. Ruth and her doll. They're going to get you next, Barbara. Be careful. You who are of the next life... You who wanders in the darkness... You who has not rested in peace... We summon you. We summon you this very moment. Ruth, hear our summon. Traverse the bridge that separates the darkness of death from the light of life. Let us feel your presence, Ruth. Listen to these voices who want to communicate with you. Come to us, Ruth. Let me feel your presence. Come... You deceived me, Beatrice! You deceived me! You never told me that Barbara was the reason. You deceived me! You deceived me, Beatrice! You'll pay for this! You'll pay! You'll pay for this! I'll kill you Barbara! I will not stop until I get my revenge! I'll kill you Barbara! I will not stop until I get my revenge! I'll kill you Barbara! I'll kill you! I'll kill you Barbara! Slowly... Slowly... Just like the way you killed me. I'll kill you. I'll kill you with panic! I'll kill you with panic, Barbara. I'll kill you. We're leaving, Ms. Esguerra. Please take care of Fritz. If he ever needs to contact us You can always contact us with a long distance phone call. Does Mr. Martinez know how long you and Karen are going to be gone on vacation? I'm not sure when we are going to be back. We're going to be off. These past few days... I've noticed that Karen has been acting quite differently. Especially that night when I talked to her When she answered me... Its almost as if... it was Ruth who was speaking It is as though Ruth was speaking was to me. I know what you mean, Barbara. But as you have told me Even the priest whom you asked advice from wouldn't even believe you. Aling Benita, you're the last person whom I hope would believe me. But if i fail to convince you, who else would I turn to? Barbara, I know Ruth. She can be impetuous, possessive, and she always has to have her way. I believe that if Ruth was still alive, she would do those things that you have told me. I believe everything that you have told me, Barbara. Karen! Ruth! Aling Benita! Ruth! Be afraid of the Holy Trinity and their Eternal Power Aling Benita! Aling Benita! Ruth! Let your soul rest in peace. Don't use Karen to persecute Barbara. Your act of suicide is already a very grave sin. And with the things you are doing now You are only aggravating the gravity of your sins. Barbara and Fritz have never wronged you. You should let your soul rest in peace. If you refuse then I will do everything within my power to have your soul rest in peace. (praying in Latin) Karen! What happened to Karen? Don't worry, Barbara. Nothing bad has happened to Karen. And now you mind will be set at ease. Ruth will no longer disturb you. We're going to be leaving, Barbara. I'll be back this afternoon, before dark. My son here is really worried about his wife. He said that she may be close to giving birth. As you may know, it is my daughter-in-law's firstborn. Ok, Aling Benita. Are you sure you want to leave this place this early? It's just that two days is not enough for you to see all the beautiful scenery around this island. I'm sure that Karen and I will have time to visit all the beautiful places in just one day. We really need to go home in two days time. I'm really worried about Fritz' condition in the hospital. Remember to be always good. Grandma Benita, please bring home some rice cakes. Of course. We'll be off. Ok. We're leaving. Aunt Babs, let's ride the speedboat We'll have Tasyo show us around the island. Is it ok, Aunt Babs? Let's do it tomorrow. No one will be left to oversee the house. How about just me and Erlyn? Ok, but don't be out long. Ok, Aunt Babs. Let's go, Erlyn. -Erlyn, please take care of Karen. -Ok. Karen, remember to behave. Ok, Aunt Babs. Come on, Erlyn. Let's go, Mr. Tasyo. Aling Benita? Karen? Erlyn? Erlyn. Yes? Aunt Babs? I'm sorry. The speedboat's engine broke down on the other island. I'm really sorry. Have Tasyo take you to the town, so you can fetch Aling Benita. We don't have anyone to accompany us tonight. Ok, Ms. Enriquez. Aunt Babs? Have you been waiting for us long? I'm really sorry, Aunt Babs. It will never happen again. Let's go back the house. Come on. Aunt Babs? Mommy. Karen. Erlyn? Aling Benita. Ruth? Aling Benita! Karen. Ruth! The moment that I have long awaited has come, Barbara. The fulfillment of my revenge. Ruth! Ruth, listen to me! If you want to kill me, then you should be the one to face me! I know you love Karen, but I love her too. And with what you're doing to me right now... you're forcing me to hurt her. and to hurt myself. Don't risk the life of your daughter just to fulfill your revenge. I can bring myself to kill Karen just to save my life! No, Barbara. I know you. I know you love Karen. And you can never bring yourself to hurt her! Just try, Ruth! Just try. Do you think I?m bluffing? Come on. Come closer! I will prove that everything that I've said is true! C'mon Ruth! Come closer! Come closer! Come closer! Karen! Aunt Babs! Pray, Karen! Pray! Karen! Ruth! Listen to me! You're no longer the Ruth who was the Mother of Karen! You're no longer the Ruth who was my sister! You're no longer the Ruth who was Fritz' wife! Ruth! You're already dead! You're already dead! This is no longer the place where you used to reside. This is no longer your world! This is the world of the living! Like me! Like Karen! Like Fritz! And you have no right to persecute us in the remainder of our lives in this world! It's true! I have feelings for Fritz! But that was a kind of love that never impeded on your happiness! It was a kind of love that knew how to endure and suffer! A love that didn't persecute or take revenge! Is that how your love is, Ruth? Does it know how to endure or to suffer? Is your love sincere? Pure? and without a trace of selfishness? If that's how your love is, then come here and kill me! take me to the to your world! So then you will know that not even death could kill a love that is genuine. Come here Ruth! Kill me! Kill me! Kill me! Show yourself to me Ruth! Show yourself! Show yourself to me Ruth! Show yourself! Show yourself! Karen! Ruth. Barbara! Karen. Karen! God! Help! Pick up the broken mirror, Barbara. Pick it up with both hands. So that you can feel the pain that you've caused me. So that you can feel the pain in my heart. Until my soul is torn to shreds. Pick up the broken mirror, Barbara. Pick it up. Stab yourself. Feel the passing of a soul traversing into the next life. A soul that is looking for justice. Justice through the death of another's happiness. Pick up the mirror, Barbara. Put an end to all of your miseries. You won't find peace in this world. Not as long as I'm here, Barbara. Go ahead. Pick up the mirror. Pick it up. Pick it up. Stab yourself. Stab yourself. Stab yourself. Stab yourself. Stab yourself. Aunt Babs! Aunt Babs? Aunt Babs! Karen... It's all over now, Karen. Stab yourself. Stab yourself. Stab yourself. subtitles by empire434
