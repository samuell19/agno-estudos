This is the last of the trucks, lieutenant. We'll embark in four hours. Give the men, oh, another hour at the party and then get them up fast. Do you think they're having too much fun to sail for the States? I think you're right. - Good luck to you. - Thank you. - Okay, driver. - Yes, sir. Okay, Miller, out you go. This infirmary's closed. And you're going home along with the rest of us. Yeah, that's right. They finally found a ship for you. It ain't the Queen Mary, but it floats. Why don't you go to the party downstairs... ...and have some fun until it's time to leave? Uh... Listen, sonny boy, if you're too shy to go to a party... ...okay, don't go. But don't kid me about this silly bandage. You've been over the mumps for two days now and we both know it. What's wrong with you anyway? You don't talk, you don't make friends. You don't whistle at me or any of the nurses. You know, nobody even knows your first name. Uh, Danny. Danny. If you was in love, I could understand it. But you don't even have a pinup girl in sight. Hey, it is love. Well, what's the matter? Can't I even take a look at your girl? - That's the Brooklyn Bridge. - Sure. That's my pinup girl. Isn't she a beauty? - But you're not from Brooklyn. - You wanna bet? Listen, I'm from Brooklyn, so don't tell me. I know what Brooklyn guys are like and they're not like you. Well, I can't help that, but that's where I'm from. Go ahead, ask me some questions about it. Go ahead, ask me, why don't you? Where is the Loew's Met? Nevins Street. Prospect Park? Eastern Parkway. Ebbets Field? Bedford and Sullivan. So there. You could've read it in a book. But if it is true, then you really ought to be ashamed of yourself. Hiding like a rabbit in a hole. Why aren't you at that party like a Brooklyn guy... ...making friends for yourself and for Brooklyn? A Brooklyn guy is a friendly guy. Well, I will be once I get home. It's easier in Brooklyn. I don't care how many photographs you got, don't care how many streets you know. When I see you out making a friend, then I believe you're from Brooklyn. Hey, now, fellas, now come on, cut it out. - How you doing, pal? - Shh. Brooklyn. Shh! Good, huh? Flat. Flat as yesterday's beer. Hey, hey, bud, do you know "Whose Baby Are You?" "Whose Baby Are...?" No, no, I'm frightfully sorry, I don't, but... Never mind. Forget it. Say, say, I know that song. You mind if I give you a small rundown? No, not at all. Sit down. Baby, baby Whose baby are you? Baby, baby Whose baby are you? Well, that sounds more like Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony. Sure, the notes are the same, but it hasn't got a beat. - A beat? - Yeah, you know, a beat. Oh, no, I'm afraid I haven't got that. Look, why don't you take over? - Wait, I don't wanna crab your act. - Oh, I'm rather relieved. I was supposed to be entertaining, but I'm hardly succeeding. Good night. Hey, fatso, go on, hit it. - Hey, fellas, chow. Chow! Let's get that, boys. Brooklyn. Do I understand that you're from Brooklyn? Why, yes, as hard as it may be to believe. No, no, quite the contrary. You're so friendly. It's only in Brooklyn that people are as friendly as that. Just a second, with that accent you're not gonna tell me you're from Brooklyn. No such luck. No, that was Mama. She was born there. Well, how do you like that? My name's Danny Miller. She came to England when she was quite a child... ...but she talked about Brooklyn all her life. That's how I guessed that you were from Brooklyn. The moment that you tried to help that young man in there. The square? The guy that was playing? - I didn't do very much. - But you had such poise. I did? Such confidence, such self-assurance. - I did? - It was wonderful. Well, I guess that's the way it is with all us guys from Brooklyn. I know. That's why I'm going to ask a favor. That young man is my grandson, Jamie Shellgrove. - Oh, gee, I didn't mean to say any... - No, no. He is a square. He's shy, can't talk to people, doesn't have fun. And the music he writes... That stuff he was playing, that sounded good. It isn't young. Everything he writes sounds just like a funeral march. That's why I thought that if you were to talk to him... Me? Oh, now wait a minute, Dad... A little advice from someone like you, sure of himself. Forceful and... Why, I know that you could help him. Honest, Dad, I think you've got the wrong guy. I... Sure, I'd be very happy to give him a few pointers - Any time you say. - Thank you, Danny. We live just across the garden. - Are you the caretaker here? - Well, sort of. Oh, I wish that Jamie were a little bit more like you. You should see him trying to talk to a girl. It's gruesome. That's what it is, gruesome. And here's Danny, going back to Brooklyn. Been away four years and yet he knows that in two weeks... ...he'll find exactly the sort of girl he wants. Won't you, Danny? Well, that's right, Pop. But that's in Brooklyn. And in Brooklyn, you know, it's easier. Well, it wouldn't be easier for me. It is difficult for me to talk to people. That's unfortunate. And as if you and Grandfather seem to think there's something missing in my music... ...it's because it's missing in me. And I'm afraid that I'd be exactly the same in Brooklyn or anywhere. Look, Jamie, about anywhere I don't know, but in Brooklyn... ...in one week's time, you'll be talking to a girl. A girl? Ten girls. You'll have your pick of 10 girls. - Ten? - Mm-hm. - Stimulating town, what? - Rather. And that's not all. In two weeks, you'll be writing a new kind of music. Music that sings. In three weeks' time you'll be taking it to a publisher and having it played. But that's in Brooklyn. Of course. That's what you need, Brooklyn. You send him over to me. I'll fix him up. You won't know him when I get through with him. Gee, I gotta go. - Bye, Danny. - It's too bad. I got some good ideas. But that was the signal. - You've been awfully kind. - And thanks, thanks very much. Don't forget, if you have any trouble send him over to me. I'll take care of him, fix him, straighten him out. I'll make him the greatest so... "Duke of Dunstable. " - Hey, buddy, where you going? - Newark. - You can catch a train there for anyplace. - Oh, that's too slow, much too slow. Can this cab take me to the bridge, the Brooklyn Bridge? Mister, this cab will take you anyplace you wanna go. Come on, get in. Hold it, hold it, stop. This is it, here it is. Isn't she a beauty? Isn't she a queen? Nicest bridge that I have ever seen Her paint's a little tattered Where age has left its touch Still I guess I'll always love her very much Like the folks you meet on Like to plant my feet on The Brooklyn Bridge What a lovely view from Heaven looks at you from The Brooklyn Bridge I love to listen to the wind Through her strings The song that it sings for the town I love to look up At the clouds in her hair She's learned to wear like a crown If you've been a rover Journey's end lies over The Brooklyn Bridge Don't let no one tell you That I've been trying to sell you The Brooklyn Bridge All the folks in Manhattan are sad 'Cause they look at her And wish they had The good old Brooklyn Bridge Heavens to Betsy. What's the matter with you, silly? Wanna get yourself killed? Is that what Eisenhower taught you? You slaphappy or something? No, I'm just happy, that's all. Happy? Sonny, you're in Brooklyn. Yeah, isn't it wonderful? Soldier, you've been away a long, long time. You just get in? Yeah. Just got out too. You're glad to be in Brooklyn when you could be over there in New York? New York? That's a place to look at Brooklyn from. Say, I've gotta find an armory. There's one over on Grand Street. Take the bus on the next corner and get off at Jay Street... ...being sure to ask the conductor for a transfer. - Then you take the Jay Street trolley... - No, no, no. I want the 14th Regiment Armory. Oh, well, in that case, I gotta blow me whistle. Officer, I wasn't doing more than 30. Young lady, two blocks back, did you or did you not go through a red light? Everybody goes through it. Shouldn't be a stoplight there at all. Nevertheless, do I give you a ticket for it... ...or do you give this here soldier a lift to the 14th Regiment Armory? - Good luck, sonny. - Gee, thanks very much. - I'll see you around, huh? - Won't be here. It's my last day. Tomorrow, the New York side where I belong. Brooklyn's where they send the bad policemen. Nice day, isn't it? There aren't any nice days in Brooklyn. Don't you like it here? Does anyone? Sure. I do. I've been homesick for this place for four years now. People get homesick for some pretty terrible places. Did you just get back? Back and out. All I gotta do is reregister for the draft and I'll be a civilian again. Oh. That's why you're going to the armory? I didn't know you had to reregister so soon. Within 10 days. I wanna get it over with. I'll be going back to work pretty soon and I may not have time. You know, life here in Brooklyn's pretty fast, and I imagine... ...that I'll be swept up in the social whirl, hey. Well, here you are. Look, I can't tell you what it means to me to meet a small, dark-haired girl... ...with a turned-up nose on my first day back in Brooklyn. It's kind of like a good omen. Not that I didn't think everything was gonna be wonderful... ...but now I'm positive. Thanks. Wait till the Dodgers get him. Ladies and gentlemen, you're not setting a very good example... ...for our little guests from P.S. 65. They must be back at their own school in about an hour, so let's settle down now. Does anyone know why Johann Sebastian Bach... ...is called the father of modern music? On account of counterpoint, natch. Suppose we try this two-part invention, shall we? Leo, will you start the introduction, please? Yes, Miss Fielding. Now, I'm going to signal each group when to come in. Ready? Johann Sebastian Bach in 1685 Wrote the kind of music that has Kept his memory alive - I beg your pardon. - Yes, may I help you? Yes, ma'am. I was told at the armory that I could reregister here for the draft. Just down the hall and turn to your right. Thank you very much. You can tell it's Bach Because the counterpoint Will tire each joint in every finger In each hand He pioneered in modern composition And to his everlasting fame And he's held in awe By every great musician Johann Sebastian Bach's his name Time and time we've had it Brought to our attention That he was the father Of two-part invention If in class you've followed me You've learned to know The two from three This is a Bach invention I have brought to your attention This is Bach's two-part invention All proposed By Johann Sebastian Bach All by Johann Sebastian Bach We said Johann Sebastian Bach The great Johann Sebastian Bach John Sebastian John Sebastian Bach Was his Name? Leo, will you please take over? Will you kindly step into the corridor? - Wasn't it funny, my meeting you here? - I don't think it's funny at all. Think of all the places there are in Brooklyn. Oh, yes, indeed, it's an amazing coincidence. Congratulations. But will you leave now, please? Oh, sure, yeah. I guess I was disturbing the kids. On the contrary, it was the teacher you were disturbing. You mean you're angry? Oh, I suppose you think I should be flattered. No. There must be something in that mind of yours... ...to have made you follow me half across the city. Very clever of you to have found me too. I didn't follow you. You didn't? No, you see, I was looking for someone, but it wasn't you. - Oh. - See, I registered here for the draft... ...because I went to school here. Now I've got to reregister. - I'm sorry I bothered you. - Well, look, you... You do see what I thought, don't you, and why? Oh, sure, it might've been true. I could've followed you. As a matter of fact, I wanted to follow you. But I'm glad I didn't... ...because you're a very mean girl. Look, when you've made a mistake... ...all you can do is admit it and say you're sorry. And, well, I'm very sorry. Then it's okay. Brother, you really got sore, didn't you? Well, so did you. I wouldn't have if this had been anyplace but Brooklyn. Everyone's supposed to be friendly here. You should get over those ideas of yours about Brooklyn. No one is friendly here. Everything is horrible. No nails. Fifty times I told you, no nails in the wall. Cossack! Gestapo! Stool pigeon! Sticks and stones will break my bones, but no nails. Hey, Nick, aren't you gonna say hello to a guy? - Have we been introduced? - Formally. I'm Danny Miller. Don't you remember me? - Come stai? - Molto bene. Sure, I remember you. You're the kid who used to draw them awful pictures of me on the school building. But you know something? I could never get sore. They looked just like me. Now look at you in a uniform, like a hero. I just got back today. And you came here? To see me? Just to see me? Well, how do you like that? Little girl, run along and put up your posters or you'll be late for the next class. Only, try and make just one hole for each one, huh? Yes, Nick. Gee, mister, you've got talent. Cossack. Huh! You know, speaking of talent, you've got lots of it in that music room. Not excluding the teacher. Miss Fielding here, she sings like a nightingale. Yes, I heard. You know, Miss Fielding, you should be in opera. That's what she keeps telling the man at the opera house. Only the man at the opera house keeps saying no. - So I gave it up. - Oh, you didn't. Oh, I did. Well, Mr. Miller, goodbye. And I hope you prove I'm wrong about Brooklyn. - See you around sometime, huh? - I guess so. It looks like I'll be here the rest of my life. Uh, listen, up to now I never had a chance to listen to anybody's war experience. What do you say? I got a little flat down in the basement. We could have some red wine, some garlic toast. You like garlic toast? Sure, I love it. First, I've gotta reregister for the draft. Oh, that's in Room 31. Then I'd like to find some clothes and a place to live. Then how about supper? No, that's no good. It's your first night home. I can't think of anyone I'd rather spend it with. I have no family. - No girl? - Uh-uh. - Not at all? - Not yet. It's one of my ambitions, though, soon as I settle down. Well, speaking as one who never got one, a girl is what you should get first. Then if you don't get nothing else, it doesn't matter. You still got her. See you later, huh? Sure, and thanks, Nick. Hi. - Hello. How do you like my new London drape? Comes direct from Carnahan's Swap Shop on Atlantic Avenue. - You cold, Danny? - Hm? Oh, no. The smart set just isn't wearing shirts this season, old thing. Little common, you know? Oh, couldn't find one, huh? Come on, I'll lend you one. Say, Nick, you got it fixed up swell. I always say either you got a feeling for homemaking or you ain't. A beauty, eh? Gee, thanks, Nick. The collar has only been turned over once. - Can you keep a secret, Danny? - Sure. You see that doily? I knitted that myself. That's just between us. I always feel better in the kitchen. Maybe it's because I was born in one. My mother being busy cooking spaghetti at the time. And speaking of spaghetti... ...could you make...? Could you make like this is one of them fat calves... ...they're always getting out to welcome people home? Mm! There isn't a calf in the world smells that good. I'm glad to hear you say that. But tell me... ...how did you make out today? After I got reregistered, I didn't have much time to look for a place to live. And what little time I did have, I couldn't find one. Oh, well, I'll go to a hotel. A hotel? Why, the man don't know what he's saying. Sonny, there hasn't been a hotel room or a flat open in Brooklyn in years. People have to live someplace. Sure. They're living in gutters, in tents, in trees, in powder rooms. Why, even the cemeteries are crowded. And the crowds ain't all dead. I lived in one myself behind Otis J. Fuller, 1810 to 1850... ...for five days. And at the Museum of Natural History on Eastern Parkway... ...there's a family by the name of Snyder living under a brontosaurus. That's a prehistoric animal. Those Snyder babies are growing up thinking the sky is made out of bones. A hotel? You're staying here with me. Honest, Danny, you'd be doing me a favor. It gets pretty lonesome sometimes. Okay, that's settled. Oh, but, Nick, I, uh... Mr. Chips, a houseguest we got, and that calls for some celebration. That's Mr. Chips, you know, from Goodbye, Mr. Chips. His real name is Mr. Donat. You're pretty sold on this guy, aren't you? I like him because all the kids were crazy about him. I seen the picture 11 times. I even read the book. But nowhere does it say why they liked him so much. That's easy to figure. For example? Well, why do the kids in this school like you? They don't. That's my affliction. I like them but they don't like me. I like you, Pop. To your health, Danny. Welcome home. As soon as I close the windows in the gymnasium, we eat. Wait, I'll go with you, Pop. After you, mine guest. After you, mine host. Are you all right? How did you get in here? Through the window, natch. He's always trying to sneak in here. All you gotta do is leave a window or a door open, and right away he's in. But why? What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? He's a little fella, littler than the others. And he keeps trying to exercise so he'll grow. Well, gee, that's swell. Only I don't grow. So, what's the use? You've got ants? You can't wait? Don't worry, son. You'll grow. But how do I know? Well, look, you just can't wish for things alone. - You've gotta work for them. - And work hard. Some things you just don't get a written guarantee with. Listen to Danny. You see, you gotta believe certain things. I believe a lot of things I can't prove. Like what? Well, like, uh... I believe, I believe I believe in wishing wells And I also believe in a lot of things Things the daisy tells I believe, I believe That a four-leaf clover brings Lots of luck, lots of joy Lots of happiness I believe these things And when it's Christmas I believe in Santa Claus Why do I believe? I guess that I believe because I believe, I believe I believe that dreams come true If you'll wish for the dream By the wishing well Don't tell the wish Or you'll break the spell It may sound naive But that's what I believe I believe, I believe In the stars that sail the sky I believe in the sign of the zodiac Yes, and Gemini I believe, I believe That your luck will show again If you manage to borrow a rabbit's foot For your pocket chain I knew a gypsy And her skill with the cards was great Once I held three kings But they're no good against a straight I, I believe That it's all within your heart Once you've learned how to smile With an empty purse You're richer than all the universe Rainbows up your sleeve And that's what I believe I believe, I believe I believe I'm 6-foot-2 I believe I can break any guy in half Any guy like you I believe, I believe I'm as charming as can be I can see all the girls in the neighborhood Running after me Aladdin had a lamp He rubbed it quite a lot I don't need a lamp I only need the faith I've got I believe, I believe I believe the world is mine Oh, I don't like to brag but I feel I can Out-super men like the Superman It may sound naive But that's what I believe You didn't get the job, huh? For two weeks I've been trying to get up enough courage to see my old boss. Today I saw him. And he was swell too. I told him I didn't wanna be a shipping clerk anymore... ...that I wanted to sell the music, and he said: "Fine. All you gotta do is audition for the job... ...and if you're good enough, it's yours. " So you sang for him, huh? No, I didn't even bother to try. It's no use, Nick. Whenever I have to sing before strangers, I just freeze up. I'll just be a shipping clerk. Oh, Danny, don't say that. Don't worry. It'll be all right. Well, I gotta clean the music room. Are you just gonna sit there? Yeah, I got some thinking to do, Pops. Don't worry about me. Worry about you? Ha! You're gonna be fine. You're gonna be great. Oh, Leo, that was beautiful. Do you know you have a great future? Yeah. Working in my mother's candy store. Oh, but surely you plan to go on with your music. Perhaps if someone spoke with your mother. Mom doesn't need any talking to. She's dying because I can't go on studying. Look, it's tough on her working in that store alone. When I graduate in June, it's gotta stop. But, Leo, if you kept on with your music... ...someday you could do so much more for her. Yeah. But what happens between now and someday? - Hey, Leo. - Yeah? Excuse me for butting in. Can't you get one of them scholarships someplace? They just take care of your tuition at music school. I'd still need books and clothes and a decent piano. And I can't let Mom go on working 15 hours a day to get them for me. It's my turn to help her. But doesn't the Brooklyn Music Forum give a scholarship that includes money... ...and quite a lot of money? Yeah, that scholarship comes up every five years. They're giving it this year, just a couple of weeks away. Well, that's wonderful. You're gonna try for it, of course. No. You have to be 17 to be eligible. I'm only 16 and a half. Gee, I wish I could help you. What's the use of talking? I can't even help myself. For two years now, I've been trying to get a new mop. Annie, what about you? You didn't mean it when you said you were giving up singing. Didn't you do good at them auditions? Oh, all right, I guess. Only the man said my voice was cold. What does that mean? That you need more schmaltz? I don't know, Nick. How do you warm up a cold soprano? I wish I knew. Well, it's not that tragic. So I'm a little miserable. Leo is miserable and everybody in Brooklyn is miserable. By the way, how is your protégé, Mr. Miller? Miserable. Not getting that job knocked all the bounce out of him. Oh, that's too bad. You know, maybe he should do something to raise his spirit... ...like go dancing or go to the movies or something like that. Oh, Annie, would you? Oh, Nick, I couldn't. I haven't even been asked. He wouldn't have the nerve, but I'm asking. If you just dropped in for a minute, say, after supper. Why, just your coming in to see him would puff him right up. He thinks you're stupefying. He's awfully low, Annie. Honest. Well, what time do you finish supper, Nick? Hey, Nick, don't you do those dishes without me. You don't have to help me. I like dirty dishes. That's very pretty. Isn't it, though? That's Jamie's music. I put some words to it coming over on the boat. Time after time I tell myself that I'm So lucky to be loving you So lucky to be The one you run to see In the evening When the day is through I only know What I know The passing years will show You've kept my love so young So new And time after time You'll hear me say that I'm So lucky To be loving you That's very nice. You feel better now, huh? Yeah, sure. I kind of gave myself a good talking to. You see, I kept thinking how different things would be when I got back. Of course, the only thing I didn't figure was me... ...that I'd be the same guy I was when I left. A little guy not sure of very much. Maybe someday I'll be a big guy. Until then I'll take the shipping-clerk job. Oh, Danny. I'll be the greatest shipping clerk you ever saw, and I'll like it too. Because you don't get what you want doesn't mean it's no good. Yeah, that's right. You know somebod...? You know somebody I'd wish you'd talk to? - Annie. - Anne Fielding? Yeah, she's given up singing on account of they say her voice is cold. And of top of that, she hates her job. Teaching kids? How can anyone hate teaching kids? It ain't what she wanted. She's pretty miserable. I got a feeling she just goes home and sits. Like she's hiding from everybody. Oh, that's no good. She's gotta get out more often... ...and go to parties or a dance or a movie or something. That's what I keep telling her. I think if you'd talk to her, she might listen to you. She likes you. She thinks you're stupefying. - Oh, now wait a minute. - Well, she asked me about you. Could it be that you asked her about me? Believe me... Believe me, she asked me first and, uh... The doorbell. I wonder who that could be. It could be Miss Fielding, coming to cheer up the Lonely Hearts Club. It could be. And if it is, it's like with good intentions. So nobody will act like a stinker. Don't worry, Pop. Nobody will. - Hello, Nick. - Why, Annie, what a surprise. I thought I'd drop in and beg a cup of coffee. Beg a cup of coffee? Why, you can have the coffee and the coffee pot. Look, Danny, company. - Hello. - Hello. Oh, Annie, excuse me. I gotta go close the windows in the gym. Uh, uh, uh... But, Danny, the windows. But, Nick, the company. Aren't you gonna ask Miss Fielding to sit down? Oh, sure. Annie, won't you sit down? We have some fresh coffee on the stove. I'll get you some. Oh, well, here we are. I hear Brooklyn isn't turning out quite as well as you expected. I know it's discouraging, but don't be depressed, after all... Look, Miss Fielding, you're awfully nice, but please don't worry about me. I'm doing fine. From what Nick tells me, you're the one that's been going to pieces. Hating your job and giving up your singing. Why, you ought to be ashamed. Maybe they're right about your voice. Shh! Danny, Danny. If you hate teaching kids, that's probably why your voice is cold. Maybe it'd warm up if you took some interest in them instead of just yourself. You know, most people want something and they're never happy until they get it. And instead of enjoying themselves while working to get what they want... ...they go around being miserable all the time. And that's what you're doing. That's your trouble. Oh, so that's my trouble, is it? I suppose you're the person to straighten me out. This ain't turning out just right. What about you and your dreams of Brooklyn? What are you doing? You're just sitting here sulking. - I've decided what to do now. - Tell other people how to run their lives... ...because it's easier than running your own? Thank you very much. Oh, Nick, I'm sorry. Good night. All I've got to say is "wow. " You know, you might be good for her singing. You made her awfully mad. Hmm. Would you say offhand I made a very good impression? She'll be back to apologize. I give her 10 minutes. - Uh-uh. - You'll see. She likes you. How can you tell? What's the matter with you? Haven't you never been to the movies? Take the hero and the heroine. How do they start out? Fighting, like you and Annie. Why? Because they won't admit they like each other. Well, I admit I like her. So all you gotta do is wait for her to admit it. How long can you live? What she's doing now is called fighting the heart. In other words... There ain't no other words. Ten minutes. Two minutes. - Nick, it couldn't be. - No? Who do you think it is? The Dukedom of Dunstable, maybe? Come to see Brooklyn, the borough of your dreams. I say, old boy, how do you do? Perhaps you don't remember me. Sure, sure I do. Jamie, come on in. - What are you doing here in Brooklyn? - Well, I just... How's Pop? I mean, how's the duke? Very well, thank you. Gee, it's good to see you. Let me look at you. It don't look like Annie to me. Jamie, this is Nick Lombardi, my best friend. Nick, this is Jamie Shellgrove. From England? The one who's gonna be a duke? It's a pleasure to meet Your Dukedom's acquaintance. That can't be right. What do you call him? Jamie. How do you do? How do you do? Boy, that's so classy. Come on, sit down and tell us why you're here. Oh, excuse me. Oh, Danny, I'm terribly sorry. Will you please forgive me? I didn't mean anything I said. You came back. Gee, so much is happening to me today. There's someone I want you to meet. Anne, this is Jamie Shellgrove, my friend from England. Jamie, this is Anne Fielding. - How do you do? - How do you do? I've heard a lot about you. Danny cabled and said he'd met the most beautiful girl. - Oh, Danny. - Jamie just arrived today. I'd better run. You must have a great deal to talk about. - Please don't... - Please don't... Did you ever...? Did you ever run into a man by the name of Mr. Chips? Come on, Nick. Let's all sit down. Let's give Jamie a chance to tell us why he's here. Okay. You and me will have a little talk later. Well, I'm afraid that sending that cable was rather unwise of you. Hearing how well you were doing... ...crystallized Grandfather's dissatisfaction with me. Crystallized. I'm living. Don't your grandfather like you? Like him? Why, the duke's crazy about him. Only he wishes I were more like Danny. Like Danny? Yes, you know, forceful, confident and effectual. Effectual. He has a very fine command of the English language. Well, when your cable came, Danny, it started Grandfather thinking. There I was, he said, muddling about with my music... ...and here you are, finding exactly the job of work you wanted... ...making friends, meeting people. Oh, it made him very dissatisfied with me. So? So he remembered your last words. - My last words? - Yes, before you left. "Send him over," you said to Grandfather, "I'll straighten him out. I'll fix him up. " That's what you said. That's what I said. Yes. So that's what he did. So he sent you over to me to straighten you out, huh? Well, what does he want done, eh, old chap? I haven't the vaguest idea. Danny, do you know? Yeah, I know. Can you do it? You don't think for a moment that I have the slightest intention of imposing on you. I'll stay in Brooklyn for a few days just to satisfy Grandfather. Well, besides, I rather think I'd like it. That would be fine. Except that it wouldn't be so fine. The old man's got a right to expect something to happen... ...because I told him it would, and he believed me. Well, do you think you can do what he expects? If I can't, at least I want him to know it's my fault and not Jamie's. There are some things I told you... Oh, Danny, I... I've got to be going. And, well, I'm very happy to have met you and I do hope I'll see you again. I hope you'll like Brooklyn too. Oh, I love it. I love it already. Good night, Nick. Thank you for the wonderful cup of coffee. It has been my pleasure, old girl. I was gonna tell him the truth. Why? Why not help him instead? All he needs is a little loosening up, and that should be simple. Don't you remember what you said a while ago? That I can't even run my own life. Remember what you said a little while ago? Maybe it'd help if you took an interest... ...in someone else's problem instead of just your own. Good night, Danny. I say, old bean. Nick. I underslept. What's the matter, Danny? Him. Jamie. How can I help him when he finds out what a bust I am? Why don't you try for that job? Why don't you try just once more? If you sing Jamie's song like you sang it this afternoon... ...you'll murder them. - Ah. I know just what'll happen, Nick. I'll find myself thinking, "Who said you can sing?" And there I'd be all alone. And I'd be dead. What if you wasn't alone? What if I was with you... ...and you were singing to me, your friend, your pal? Say, Nick, that might work out all right. Sure it would. With things as rotten as they are. It can't be worse. Would you be good enough to tell Mr. Dobson I'm here to audition for him? Would you be good enough to tell me your name? You know very well... Listen, sonny, tell him that Daniel Webson Miller is here to see him. Like a wounded swan. Now all you gotta do is sing. What's the matter? You scared? Well, don't you think I ought to be a little bit... ...with all this jive stuff around here? What chance have I got with a ballad? All the chance in the world. It doesn't matter what you sing. The important thing is, whatever you sing, it's gotta come from the heart. Come with me. It's a good thing I came along. Take Crosby. What made him the singer of the age? - His voice. - That helped. But it was really his heart. And Jolson, what put him over on the stage? His voice? You don't understand. It's heart that made them all It's the difference between the big And the small It doesn't have to be witty or smart Just as long as it comes From the heart It doesn't have to be classic or art Just as long as it comes From the heart Just put more heart into your voice And you'll become the people's choice Just make up your mind From the start That the song's gotta come From the heart Why, only last year the kids asked me to sing at their graduation exercises. I did. But I made a ghastly mistake. I didn't sing from the heart. I sang from the nose. - Well, how did it sound? - I don't know. The note hasn't come out yet. Just make up your mind From the start That the song's gotta come From the heart I could use a longer piano. Let's take the world's great love songs. What makes everybody melt when they hear them? Heart. For example. You see what I mean, Danny? Now, try and follow me in this one. Yeah. Believe me, that's got heart. Hey. Hey! Don't be afraid You'll make the grade Why, you can sing As good as Bing That's why I say when you start That the song is gotta come From the heart Sing it, Danny. Make me proud. Okay, Nick. Stand back. It doesn't have to be witty or smart Smile. Long as it comes From the heart Keep going. It doesn't have to be classic or art Great. Long as it comes From the heart The kid's murder. I'll give them that I'll give them this I'll strut away Boy, you can't miss. Just put a star on my chart They won't need this anymore. Because the song's gonna come From the heart Don't work cheap. - On opening nights - On opening nights - Your name in lights - Your name in lights Why we won't stop Till you reach the top We'll order our meals à la carte That's expensive. If the song comes From the heart We'll be tremendous If the song comes From the heart They'll holler, "bravo. " If the song comes From the heart Heart Miller. That was wonderful. You can start to work Monday morning. Gee, thank you very much, Mr. Dobson. That's all right. - What did I tell you? - Oh, thanks, Nick. Say, we ought to get Anne and Jamie and go someplace and celebrate. Sure, only I can't go along. I gotta go to a meeting of the Custodian Benevolent Society. Well, can't you skip it for now? It don't look good if the treasurer don't show up. And besides, you got no idea how catty those janitors can be. Huh-huh! Oh, I must say this is really delightful. Let's drink to Danny's new job, shall we? This time next year, president of the company. Oh, this time next year, president and owner of the company. Oh, but, of course, forgive me, Danny. President and owner. Okay, now that I'm all set. Still some unfinished business before the house. Namely, i. e., Jamie. Move that we table the problem of Jamie at least until after dinner. Well, I must say, that at this moment, you don't look very much like a problem. I must say, at this moment, I don't feel very much like a problem. There's one thing that will make me forget Jamie's future and that's spaghetti. Speaking of spaghetti, what's with the waiter? We're in no hurry. Let's live dangerously. Go on, Anne. Sing some more, please. - No, I can't. - Why? Because some idiot said she had a cold voice, that's why. Whatever that means. Well, it was no idiot. It was the director of the Brooklyn Music Forum. You're not gonna take one man's opinion, are you? You know better. You've gotta keep trying. Well, I'm tired of trying. To get ahead in music, you have to know someone and someone important. You can't just walk in and sing. Why not? If you're good. If you know you're good. Lately I'm beginning to think they may be right... ...that there is something missing in my singing. - Well, I think your voice is beautiful. - Oh, but you haven't really heard it. - I've heard enough to know it's beautiful. - You can't know from what you've heard. Well, go on. Sing something else. Yeah, go ahead. I dare you, Annie. Well, I never let anyone dare me. And don't you call me Annie. Okay. I double dare you, Annie. Now, look, Danny Miller, I... Don Giovanni. - Go ahead. I'm listening. - So am I. - But that's a duet. - Well? You don't expect me to sing a duet by myself, do you? - Is that the only thing that's stopping you? - Yes. - Well? - Well? Ahem. Well. Well, well, Jamie. Hello, Nick. What are you doing here alone? Boy, this is my chance. I got questions to ask you about Mr. Chips. Hey, where's Danny? Where's the Brooklyn thrush? - He's taking Anne home. - Ahh! L 'amour toujours, I'amour. Oh, yes. L 'amour toujours, I'amour. You're quoting me. Maybe there's a streak of royalty in my blood, huh? Say, that's a very fine chateau. You know we... You know... You know we gotta start rounding up a doll for you. A doll? A chick or as they was known in my youth, a sweet patootie. Nick, there are so many new things to get used to in Brooklyn... ...I think it's a little soon for a sweet patootie. The only way to see a town is with a girl hanging on your arm. Jamie, maybe Danny would let you borrow Anne for sightseeing purposes. She likes him quite a lot, doesn't she? And he's crazy about her. Quite. Nick, you were asking me about Mr. Chips... Jamie, if we could only find you a girl like Anne. Look, Nick, why don't you try this on? It's never suited me. Do you think this type lid would do something for my personality? I think your personality would do something for the, uh, lid. Lend it a little dash, shall we say? Ahh. We was made for each other. It becomes you, Nick. It's yours. In return, I'm gonna try and find you a girl like Anne. Think how swell it'd be, walking her home like Danny does... ...sitting on her front stoop, whispering sweet nothings... ...and talking over your plans with her. If I had a girl like Anne, I think I'd want to talk about her all the time. There's so many things I'd wanna know. When she was a little girl, did she wear pigtails... ...or big bows in her hair? Did she wear high-button shoes and hate them? You know, romantic little things like that. That's what I'd wanna know if I was sitting on the front stoop with a girl like Anne. Gee, if we could only find a girl for him. Oh, I know you wanna do a lot for Jamie, but, honestly, Danny... ...I don't see where your getting a girl for him is quite the right way. After all, a man has to get a girl for himself. But Jamie's much too shy. He never will. Oh, I don't know. He doesn't even talk when he's with strangers. A girl would never notice him. Oh, I don't know. Here I've been sitting here doing nothing but talking about Jamie. Well, after all it's only natural. He's your friend and, well, I don't mind talking about Jamie. I know, but there was so much I wanted to say about you and me. - That's awfully nice, Danny, but I... - Oh, please, Anne, don't go. But, Danny, it's late. There are 25 schoolteachers living here... ...and you don't want them talking about my coming in after midnight? Oh, of course not. Good night, Danny, it's been a wonderful evening. Gee, I guess we're going steady now, huh? Hey? You got any records for me? We wanna play them all over again. You picked out some beauts. Johnny, your mother called about three times. - I think you'd better make some tracks. - I'll go right home, Danny. Emil, how'd you like those records I got you? Ma says if I play that once more, she's gonna leave home. - But she likes it too. - Hey, Danny? Wait a minute, kids. I'll get him to sing it for us. Say, Danny, will you sing this one for me? I can't read music, you know? - Which one? - This one. - Come on, all the booths are filled. - We can't get to hear anything. That's right. You might be late for supper, and I'll have every mother in Brooklyn on my neck. Okay, I'll do it for you. Come on. I can see a steeple Surrounded by people Oh, how real it all starts to seem Just as the choir is singing My alarm starts ringing It's the same old dream And then my thoughts inspire A scene by the fire In a cottage close by a stream I know it all by heart now We're about to part now It's the same old dream If you but knew How many times I pretend That I'm with you I know your heart would unbend You'd see me through Until my dream Had a happy ending And I can picture clearly The things I love dearly And in the center You reign supreme We kiss and I discover That I'm the lonesome lover It's the same old dream Well? Didn't like the song, huh? Well, maybe you didn't like the way I did it. Suppose you take a crack at it. Let me see what you can do with it. I can see a steeple Surrounded by people Oh, see how real it starts to seem Get the choir singing And then My clock starts ringing It's the same old dream My thoughts inspire Scenes by the fire In a cottage close By a rippling stream Be rippling You know it by heart now We're just about to part now It's the same old dream Slightly off the beam The same old dream Well, that's swell, for kids your age... ...but when you get to be my age, why, you mellow a little bit. As a matter of fact, you enjoy doing it this way. If you but knew How many times I pretend That I'm with you I know your heart would unbend You'd see me through Until my dream Had a happy ending And I can picture clearly The things I love dearly In the center You reign supreme We kiss and I discover I'm a lonesome lover It's the same old dream It's the same Old dream Does that mean that someone's gonna buy a copy? Oh, I am. I am. I am. Over there. - Good work. - Thank you very much. Oh, excuse me a moment. - Hi, Jamie - Hello, Danny. What do you think happened? Since I've been here, business has picked up. It's as it should be. You're almost finished for the day? Yeah. Oh, I mean, no, no. Mr. Dobson wants to talk to me about something very important. - And I'll probably be stuck here for a while. - But, Danny, Anne's coming for dinner. Yes, I know. Would you do me a favor and keep her company until I get home? - She talks about you constantly anyway... - What an extraordinary waste of time. - Run along and I'll see you in a little while. - Right. Bye. And if you like it now, Jamie, wait till you get a load of it in the winter. After a snowstorm, that's when it's beautiful. The ice on the sidewalk. And then the thaw. The sawdust tripping you up. The muddy slush in the gutters... ...and my three brothers, the street cleaners, shoveling it up... ...and then the snowballs flying around your head. Them little murderers. Ah, Brooklyn in the wintertime. What time of year do you like best, Jamie? Oh, springtime I think. Oh, really? Isn't that funny because I do too. Really? What an amazing coincidence. Spring? I got nothing against spring. I enjoy it. We got a tree here in Brooklyn. You should see the dogwood blossoms in England in May. You should see the dogwood blossoms right here in Prospect Park in May. - I hope you'll show them to me. - You ain't eating nothing. What's the matter? Did I cook with a heavy hand? - Oh, no, Nick, it's just that I... - Then why ain't you eating? - I don't know. - I'll tell you what. Go into the parlor... ...or rather the drawing room... ...and I'll bring you in the coffee. Right. You know, it's really been wonderful getting to know you, Anne. - Why? - Oh, I don't know. It... Well, we've hardly talked, really, and all we know about each other... ...is that we both like springtime best. Well, if we did talk... ...a great deal, I mean, I imagine we'd find we like all the same things. - So do I. - Do you really? Do you really, Anne? A catastrophe. This ain't according to the plans. What to do? What to do? Mr. Chips, you never had this problem. Your kids were smaller than my Danny. Danny. I gotta go find Danny. - What's the matter, Nick? - I ran out of sugar. It's funny, Danny said you were too shy to talk to girls. Oh, not since I've been over here, not since I met you. Jamie, if you liked someone a great deal... ...you wouldn't be afraid to tell her so, would you? Oh, no. No. I think if I liked someone a great deal, I'd want to talk about it all the time. I'd want to tell her how... How things I had taken for granted seem wonderful... ...and how everything seemed to mean more. Music and words and even people's faces. Oh, how different everything is when you like someone a great deal. - Anne? - Yes, Jamie? Jamie. Jamie. Everything's so great, I can't stand it. I can't stand it. - Hello, Annie. Look. - Hello. - Well, what is it? - It's your song. - The circles are for our pictures. - But I never wrote a song. Of course you did. You didn't know that you did. - You thought it was a funeral march. - Oh, Jamie, that's wonderful. - You mean this is...? - Yeah, yeah. This is your song. I put words to it and I played it for Mr. Dobson, and he loved it. And he's gonna publish it. Why, you're a big success, that's all. Oh, Danny. Jamie, isn't that wonderful? Look, I hope you're not sore that I put words to it. I didn't change the melody at all, honest. It's just the way you wrote it. - Oh, I'm not, it's just... - Let me play it for you. Anne, sing it for him, won't you? The music is Jamie's and the words are mine... ...and they're for you. Time after time I tell myself That I'm so lucky To be loving you So lucky To be The one you run to see In the evening When the day is through I only know What I know The passing years will show You've kept my love So young So new Time after time You'll hear me say That I'm so lucky To be loving you Oh, it's beautiful. It's perfectly beautiful. - It's wonderful, Danny. - Wonderful? Why, it's better than that. It's gonna be published. Do you realize how tough it is today to have a song published? It's yours too, we're partners. Shellgrove and Miller. Why, we might even worry Rodgers and Hammerstein a little bit. I hope you've got more funeral marches because Mr. Dobson wants to see us. We're gonna get a quick start on your career: I can't, Danny. I'm going back to England. Why, you don't know what you're saying. You can't leave now. We're just getting started. Don't you think I ought to get started in my own country? I think that... Look, we'll talk about this some more. Anne, I... Oh, please do excuse me, but I have been told that the teacher is here. Miss Fielding, the teacher. Why, yes, she is. Won't you come in? Anne, this lady would like to see you. This is Miss Fielding. Oh, please excuse that I, uh... Uh... I'm Mrs. Kardos. I'm Leo's mother. Leo's mother? Well, I'm so happy to meet you, Mrs. Kardos. Leo's the best pupil I've ever had. This is Danny Miller and this is Jamie Shellgrove, Mrs. Kardos. So happy. So happy. If you'd like to speak alone, Jamie and I could... Oh, no, no. Now that I'm here, I think perhaps it's wrong for me to come. Of course not. We're so happy to have you. Please sit down, Mrs. Kardos. Miss Fielding, I want to speak to you about Leo. You must be very proud of Leo, Mrs. Kardos. He has such great talent. What will he do with this talent? And if he does nothing, this talent will ruin his life. Anne, I don't understand. Well, Leo can't afford to go on with his music... ...after he leaves high school. And there's only one scholarship that would do him any good... ...and he's too young to apply for it. Oh, but that's frightful. All day, he's so gay and cheerful. "Mama," he tells me, "don't worry, I want to work in the store with you. And at night, I will study by myself. It will be fun. " Fun that at night in his bed he cries. That he cannot sleep, he cannot eat. He's a little boy, my Leo, but in his eyes, already he's old. Oh, Mrs. Kardos, I should've done more. I should've tried much harder. I was so disappointed in my own music that I... Oh, I should've tried harder. No, no, do not feel bad. Please don't. If Leo were an ordinary boy, I could give him what he needs. But to those with talent, one owes more and this I cannot give. Who is to care that a little boy becomes artist or no? Who? Who is to care? You see, to be poor and have a son like Leo... ...this is to be ashamed always. Leo is someone for everyone to be proud of, not just his mother but everyone. You're right, he does need more than ordinary boys... ...and everyone should see he gets it. There must be some way to help him, Mrs. Kardos. - And we'll find it. - You bet we will. We could go to the directors of the Brooklyn Music Forum... ...and explain to them and plead. - You think? You think? - We will. The rule exists and if we break it at this time, we'd be establishing a precedent. Well, it seems to me the least you could do is listen to Leo play. My dear Miss Fielding, I don't doubt that the boy's magnificent... ...but there's still no point in my hearing him. Because of his age, he simply is not eligible for this scholarship. I'm sorry. Leo's mother was right. No one cares. Now, wait a minute. We said last night that we gotta care, and they will too, once they hear him. They'll have to hear him. What he needs is a concert. - We'll see that he gets it. - Oh, Danny, that's not so easy. What is that's any good? We'd have to have a place to give it in. The music shop. I know Mr. Dobson will say yes. He's wonderful about things like that. Oh, we'd have to have someone important come to see it. People whose opinions count, you know, like critics and so forth. - We'll get them. - If we could only get that board of trustees. We will. We three and Nick. Is there anything we have to do that's more important? Well, Danny, you know, to draw attention to the concert... ...we'd need a sponsor, someone important. - Do we know anybody important? - No. The people of Brooklyn. That's who'll give the concert. Do we know many people? No, but this is a swell way to meet them. Here, kids, try these. I should go to the city hall with Anne, but I can't possibly leave now. Mr. Dobson isn't here and even Fodderwing's gone. Jamie, how about you taking charge? Oh, Danny, I couldn't. For Leo? Well, I'll try. Attaboy. Hey, kids, my buddy here is gonna take charge for about an hour... ...while I run out somewhere. Oh, gee. Oh, he's a wonderful guy. Give him the breaks. Jamie, don't worry about anything. Just play loud. Anne and I have some business with His Honor. Well... ...follow me. Ahem. What are we gonna do now? Well, what can I do for you, ladies and gentlemen? Nothing, unless you can play "Whose Baby Are You?" "Whose Baby?" Well, where's the music? I'll, uh... I'll do the best I can. Baby, baby Whose baby are you? Baby, baby Whose baby are you? You told me That you'd be my love forevermore So how come you won't let me Hang around your door It ain't right, it ain't right For you to do me like you do Oh, tell me, baby Whose baby are you? You order fancy dishes Way beyond my means And while you're caviaring I'm content with beans I had to break a poker game To buy that ring That mink may not be mink But it's the closest thing It ain't right, it ain't right Spending all my money For your fancy clothes I even went in hock To buy those nylon hose And after I have bought you All that finery You say you look too swell To be seen with me It ain't right, it ain't right For you to do me like you do Oh, tell me, baby Whose baby are you? Thank you so much. You've been wonderful and I appreciate it. - Are you sure there isn't anything else? - No, I think that's all for now. - Well, we'll be back in time, Miss Fielding. It's been fun. - Bye. - Goodbye. Finished? - Well, thank you very much. - You're welcome. - Is the piano all right, Jamie? - Oh, yes, yes. They're moving the concert piano up onto the platform after dinner. Ahh. - Tired? - Oh, but it's a good tired. Perhaps you can get a nap before it's time for you to dress. - I'll take you home. - In a minute. All I can think of is Leo and the concert tonight. Do you know I never thought I'd be able to be near a stage or a platform... ...no matter how small, without thinking of myself? - About your own career? - My ex-career. About your debut, perhaps, as a great singer? At the Metropolitan. And what would you sing at your debut at the Metropolitan? Have you decided that? Oh, well, that's the first thing you do decide. I'd sing Lakmé. Sing it, Anne. All right. Oh, it was wonderful, Anne, just wonderful. And you will come to the Kardos concert tonight, won't you, Mr. Roberts? Yes, that's fine. You sure you have the address? Dobson's Music Shop. Good. I'll see you there. Goodbye. And there you are. That's the last one. Why, Nick, you're a thing of beauty. Grooming, that's my secret. Maybe it's artistic to go to Leo's concert like that, but is it polite? How's anyone gonna notice that with my new tie on? Yuk-yuk-yuk-yuk-yuk-yuk. We've got a little time yet. Gotta wait for Jamie anyway. I sure hope he got Anne to go home and rest. She must be worn out. Danny, tell me something. You ain't seen Annie lately, have you? I had lunch with her and Jamie today. No, I mean, you ain't seen her alone like... Like on a date. Oh. No, I guess I haven't. I haven't had much time... ...with the concert and all the other things I've had to do. Don't it seem to you that if you were in love... ...that you'd sort of make the time? What are you driving at, Nick? What's bothering you? You know Anne's my girl. Are you sure, Danny? Maybe it's because she was the first girl you ran into... ...and I sort of helped make it easy. What I mean is, are you really crazy about her? Well, of course I'm crazy about her. Why? Why? Why is anyone in love with anyone? There's lots of reasons like, for example, you like her eyes or something. Of course I like her eyes. They're beautiful. What color are they? Brown, dark brown. Lot of people got dark-brown eyes. But what's different about Annie's? There doesn't have to be anything different about Anne's eyes, Nick. They're beautiful, they're dark and I like them. How tall is she compared to you? Uh... About, um... What color nail polish does she use? What kind of perfume? I don't know. Do you notice things like that about people? No. I ain't never been in love. I thought that when you was, you saw little things that no one else does. Gee, I don't know. Oh, Jamie. - Sorry I'm late. I had to take Anne home. Jamie, we're having a little argument. - What color are Annie's eyes? - Dark brown. But in the light, they've got little golden flecks. How tall is she compared to you? When she's wearing high heels, she comes to here and low heels, to here. Uh, what color nail polish does she use? None. Her hands are just like a little girl's. And that perfume she uses, that's like a little girl's too... ...so clean and soapy. But you know the cutest thing about her? You can always tell when she's going to smile. Just a second before, she wrinkles up her nose. Always. Well, I think I better get dressed. Thanks, Nick. Come on, Danny. Well, you're not even dressed yet. We've gotta fetch Anne. We'll be late. Jamie, you run along and pick Anne up and I'll see you over at the music shop. Right. I never saw anybody care as much about anything... ...as Danny does about this concert. He's really a wonderful guy. Guy? How American you're getting. Yes, you... You've said a mouthful. - Jamie, let's sit down a minute. - Right. Is something wrong? Something seems to be wrong. Jamie, maybe you'll think I'm a little brazen but... Well, you know I'm in love with you, don't you? Don't say it, Anne. Yes, I am. I'm going to say it. How long must I go on pretending... ...that I don't know that you're in love with me too? You are, aren't you, Jamie? Well, when are you going to say something? He's my best friend, Anne, I... Oh, darling, that's very noble... ...but it's also very stupid and very ungrown-up. Don't you know that if nothing ever happened between us that...? Well, if nothing ever happened... I don't love Danny. So I wouldn't be any good for him, would I? Oh, Jamie. This isn't easy for me. Why don't you say something? Better come along. We'll be late for the concert. Anne. Anne, you're angry. I imagine in a little while I'll be furious but right now I'm just humiliated. Anne. Jamie, you made it quite clear there's nothing else to say. Anne, darling, what can I do? L... Let's not discuss it the rest of the evening. Let's just think about Leo and the concert. Ladies and gentlemen, I represent the Brooklyn Music Forum... ...which every five years offers a scholarship. We had thought Leo Kardos was too young to apply for it... ...but tonight, due to the efforts of some Brooklyn citizens... ...we have decided that true musicianship is beyond age limits or rules. Leo Kardos is hereby awarded a scholarship... ...which will enable him to pursue the study of music for the next five years. - Good luck, Leo. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Now, what shall I say? I know what to say. If I ever get good, it'll be because of you. I'll work hard and I'll never forget you. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you and thank you all and good night. Good night. It was very wonderful. Good night. - Well, sir, I guess we made it. - I guess we did. Everything you said about Brooklyn was true, Danny. I'm really gonna miss it. - Why, are you going someplace, maybe? - Yes, back to England in the morning. What about your career? I think I'll be able to handle it in England now. I sort of have that Brooklyn approach. - Well, that's swell. What about Annie? - Danny. Have you asked whether she'd like to go? Think she could be ready by tomorrow? Danny! You don't mean to tell me you haven't asked her to marry you yet? - Well, I... - Besides being ridiculous, it's not polite. But, Danny, what are you talking about? Anne's your girl. - Jamie, she's your girl. - Anyone can see that. Will you listen to me for just one minute? - Be a nice quiet little girl. Now, look here... - I will not be quiet. Okay, what have you got to say? I don't want Jamie through the courtesy of Danny Miller or Nick Lombardi. In fact, I don't want Jamie. Anne. - Oh, I beg your pardon. - I beg your pardon. Can you tell me...? - Jamie. - Grandfather. Don't go away. I'll be with you. - But, Jamie... Hey, Jamie! - Danny. - Hey, Pop. Say, Nick, Jamie's grandfather. Take him to Luigi's and get him a beer. Oh, don't tell me. Don't tell me I'm at last facing the Dukesdom of Dunstable. Why, you must be Mr. Lombardi. How do you do? How'd you...? How did you know? Jamie wrote me all about you. Mr. Lombardi, can you tell me what's going on here? I mean... Hello, Grandfather. - Dad, this is Miss Fielding,Jamie's girl. - How do you do? Everything I said would happen to Jamie has happened. - Show Grandpop how different you are, son. - Different? - Go on. - Well, um... - See what I mean? - He certainly has changed. Thank you, Danny. Oh, Danny. Uh, you know something? I've never had so much trouble getting rid of a girl in my whole life. - Oh, Danny, we owe you so much. - Not me. It was that nurse in England. Remember? If it hadn't been for her, I would never have talked to you. Nurse? What nurse? You didn't tell me about no nurse. Well, she was an Army nurse, Nick. And she was from Brooklyn. She wouldn't believe I was from Brooklyn till she saw me making friends. I don't know nobody who has more friends than you. - Yeah, I guess she'd believe me now. - Plump little thing, wasn't she? Oh, no, she was the kind of girl you'd think is little and plump... ...but she had a terrific figure. And she stood about so high. And she was a blond, Nick, she had blue eyes. You know, most blue eyes are round. But hers kind of slanted a little bit on the ends, and her hands... Why, Nick, did you hear what I said? Did you hear me? About her I noticed. That's the one. That's the one, I tell you. - I gotta find her. - How? Well, if she's a Brooklyn nurse she's gotta be in Brooklyn. - But maybe she ain't here. - She's gotta be here. And believe me, I'll find her. I'll bet you the Brooklyn Bridge I find her. Sure you will, Danny.
