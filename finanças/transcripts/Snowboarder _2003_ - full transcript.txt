I have never seen a skinless rabbit. If you want to eat rabbit, you have to skin it. Beshop. - Give me my glass. Sound with me. Cheers. -On our rider. Beshop does not want to sound. instead of being busy with your rabbit ... See him sit with his glass of water. What can you sell now with that beard? This is how you scare the customers away. It must be removed. you let go. - You don't get that far in showbiz. Turn up the music. You shaved your beard. -Yes. have you damaged your board? -yes, just on the roof. he gets worn out. Come and buy a new one. it's all that's left of my dad. -I know. how's work going -it's alright. Beshop has a hard time. There is less snow. Gaspard, you have to start thinking your future. you don't want to keep skiing? -I'm not skiing. Or snowboarding. That's just a trend. -Not for me. you only perform seasonal work and snowboarding. Life isn't like that. I have a job for now. That is good, right? it's not a real job. Someday I'll get there. I become pro, and then you see me on tv. If your father could hear you ... he doesn't hear me, so shut him up. Are you not ready yet? I just watched Josh's video Atterssen's Air and Style last year. You're not going to watch it now? -There's no video. And Josh is coming to the Opening in the Alps. Are we not going out then? - Can we still do that afterwards? Look what a jump. I've had that one hundred times seen, Gaspard. Are we going then? They are expecting us in the bar. No, wait. Damn it. I still don't understand that. Josh has improved. What do you mean? -he is conditionally free. he is sleeping in prison. Well done. That will be that rock sponsor learn to give it old boards. What are you doing now? -I do not care. Why not? -They are waiting for us. Is that right? -Yes. This is a system like with ski boots. Gaspard, you bring this to the car? he stands for. I make the bill. So you take this, h�? Then you have everything. I found a new spot. Are we going there this weekend? I can't do this weekend, Beshop. The opening. you know what I think about competitions. -Josh is coming. I am going there. Look what has become of him. -you edged it. That was a mistake. -I do not think so. he has been doing it for 10 years, and is still the best. I don't want to talk about him. I'm going to drink one at Popeye. Shut you down. And yes, these are the Alps, with them many options for freeriders. The best riders, the best teams are here ... The competition is going crazy. We are going crazy, and I tell you again, with Josh Atterssen. he is here, very exceptional. Josh Atterssen is among us, it is unbelievable. he is very exceptional at the Opening. Like you, he tries now maybe his board. Josh Atterssen is here. There he is, and so you see how important this Opening is. Sorry I'm late. Was it at least good? -Not so. how so? seeing them busy ... I also wanted to jump. you jump every morning. -I wanted to participate. No, Gaspard, you wanted to win. -And then? it's about the mountains, not plastic cups. I don't want you to burn yourself. - Brighten me then. That time has passed. i belong in the mountains, not on marked slopes. Find someone else. Are you really not coming along? -No. do you keep the store open? See you later, boy. how are you? I know you. I love you too. you become known. you are there every morning. what's your name? -Gaspard. Gaspard how? -Charite. you are welcome in my team. are you serious? -Yes. Come to Gstaad, in Switzerland. I'm at the castle. Good? Certainly. They are waiting for me. -Who? Cops following me since the Air and Style. is that all? Please, a picture of me. -Thank you. A castle? -in white and gold, as in fairy tales. mr. Gaspard Chariet? Is that you? -Yes. Why? I tell Mr. Atterssen that you are here. In the meantime you can have a drink. Good. Do you want to follow me? What are you drinking? -A desp�, please. A desperado? Here you go sir. -Thank you. how much do I owe you? - It's already paid, sir. so you have come. I won't let me say it twice. - Good to see you. Did you come on your snowboard? -Only, like a real one. i know you like to be alone, but this is a team. Are you going to luster me? I'll tell you. There aren't many of them that impress me. you do. I've seen your Big Air. I'm lucky. I'm lucky. I've been looking for someone like you for a long time. I wouldn't come and get you twice. -That is normal. Glad you're here. We're going against it. I'm glad I'm here. i am going to deliver you a room, and then we'll see. Good. I want to rent a room for a snowboarder. We received a letter from the government... stating that your credit expired at the Tourism Office. you understand that i am informing have to get in before i ... Are you okay? Mr. Atterssen, the room from Mr. Chariet is ready. I have to tell you something. A secret. I'll never be the first. I have finished. I want to end in beauty. I have a plan. A young snowboarder, a fan of mine. I'm going to replace him make the Air and Style jump. Does he like that? That does not interest me. Besides, he is nothing without me. That is mean. -I do it for You. you do it for yourself. -I'm doing it not to lose you. you're not gonna lose me. What do I care about that victory? you are lying. -Not true. I have to be the best one more time. Honey, you gotta help me. Will you help me? you have to deal with it. you have to motivate him. I? Why me? If he knows you, he doesn't want to be here more away. he will want to win. Hey. Josh sent us. -We can come in, huh? Nice room. We are x, Y and Z. - Why those code names? If you're in Josh's team, you start from scratch. Exactly. One letter. I am x, he Y, and he Z. I am Gaspard. It seems. This is for the pool tonight. -nice pants, huh? I didn't understand why it was here. -To take a dip. You can also slide into the water. Is Josh coming too? -No. he is sleeping in prison. right. I already forgot. you better not forget it. it is nothing. Will we see you downstairs tonight? Just relax. Gaspard, you have this never seen. Do you never knock before you come in? you were still asleep. Go back to sleep. That's always cool. Fifteen minutes later it is already crazy. A man must be able to hunt. Don't be embarrassed for me. That way we can talk quietly. did you have a good time yesterday? -Yes. it was crazy. do you like riden when you are high? -I don't need drugs. i am high of life. We go out early in the morning, very early. I want a good one from you make a snowboarder. someone. you'll love the competitions. -I always wanted to participate. I'm going to make you jump at the Air and Stylie. me at the Air and Stylie? -Yes. You can do that, I know. I can, but ... - Of course you can. Otherwise I wasn't here, huh? Go buy clothes. you must represent me. Take your pick. They are free. I have to go. That's Popeye. Beshop, everything kits? Bye, mimiche. -Day, Popeye. Many avalanches? Yes. I'm on guard with Michel. -what's up. everything alright over there? We have seen Gaspard at the border. The day before yesterday, huh, michel? didn't you have too much on? he is at the Opening. No really. he said he did it for you. And that he was looking for a spot for you. -Fun. As long as he is Tuesday comes to help in the store. Will you come to see me tonight? -Yes. Michel needs it. See you tonight. -Until then. Unbelievable, huh? How sexy. is this good? -Yes. For that grandmother downstairs and for you. -Let see how it's done. Are you all from here? -From here or from somewhere else. there are still many riders here. Without us, Gstaad was dead. -We save the economy. Would the station earn from us? - Don't bring her every time, do you? 49.95 euros for the daily special? Are they crazy here? This is not France. - Elsewhere, life is cheaper. We are not interested elsewhere. -Not at all. Take whatever you want. you are our guest, so choose. -You are Josh's guest. Then I let myself go well. -Well done. Take a look there. Stylish as always. - From Josh. you never wear too much Chanel. -Some girls do have class. Gaspard, this is Ethel. She will show you around. Say hello to him. have you already ordered? The municipality is grateful for what you do for our winter sports center, but due to the declining economic situation and the new tourism strategy of the municipality we need the financial support which you have enjoyed so far stop next year. Switzerland, Chanel ... you got it right. I don't traln anywhere. - And not with anybody. Do you mean Josh? he doesn't have it easy. His work as a savior, those cops everywhere, the nights in the jail ... Does he work as a savior? - That must be from the judge. as an alternative punishment. quite heavy for hitting a sponsor. everyone's punishment. Chic winter sports station. -This is Switzerland. it's beautiful here. What else are you doing? -I study. i'm a serious girl. - Am I not serious then? What do you mean? -Nothing. Where are we going? -Look. Where to -Not at me. To this building. What are we going to do here? -Come with me. I would like such an apartment. -That is normal. it's from Josh. it's too beautiful. you are impressed too quickly. it's for you, because you're in his team. And what about Josh? -Josh doesn't need it. Are you going to the hotel or are you staying? -I stay. And you ? - I showed you around. Wait. When do we see each other again? -We'll meet again. how are you? -Quiet. They have become stricter. how was Gaspard? -Good. he's in your apartment. What do you think of him? he is very kind. He wouldn't jump without me at the Air and Stylie. Do you think he can do it? -Yes. he has talent. I've seen him jump. he is strong. So strong that he can you continue? he only needs half an hour Josh Atterssen to play. That will work. you make the difference, snoes. Come on in. I'm here for the tralning. I didn't know you had company. you've done well. We will start. When did you meet her? - When I came to live here. Does the jail not alienate you? - That brought us closer together. They predict nicely weather today. Magnificent. - It wasn't bad, right? I don't see where I am upstairs. -you have to use your head. you have to imagine where you want to land, otherwise you fall. if you fall for the Air and Stylie, are you up to it. keep your eyes open, the rest will follow naturally. Come. I'm going to debilitate you. - I can handle it, don't worry. you have 12 months conditional, h�? Yes. you read too many magazines. Heavy for hitting a sponsor. -I hit a little too hard. What will you do with the Air and Stylie? -The federation requires a derogation. Two cops follow me so I knocked nobody down for 50,000 men. I would not like to be locked up. -me neither. it does have one advantage: I'm going to sleep early. It's going well, isn't it, with Gaspard? - he makes progress. do you like it? it's like seeing myself again. i wish i was in the future could watch. not you? Are you scared, maybe? -All the time. Do you ever think about death? -No. There is no snow in the sky. Look what I got. - That starts well. Sit down. I want you to taste something. you fall steeply backwards. This is snuff. What is that? - it's snuff. Ricqis, buddy. Sniff it up. Come on, it's Ricqi�s. Come on, get up. We go work on your speed. Stand up. Forward. Stand up. what time is it? - Three months before the selection. didn't you have to save now? -Hurry up. What is the Boarder Cross used for? -you learn snowboarding faster. It is heavy at first, but it works. Day. is this your first time? -Yes. I do not feel like it. We are starting. -To the bottom. Are they really good? -it's just tourists. I have to talk to you. - Let me enjoy it. Come with me. A nice comeback from Josh. he trusts Gaspard. Remember this was Gaspard's first Boarder Cross. What are you doing here? -Josh grinds me. you should have warned me. - I didn't mean to disappoint you. I didn't want us to meet owed anything. I don't make your bill. We stand up there, don't you remember? I forgot. Gaspard, Josh is going to ruin you. -No, he gives me everything I wanted. he uses you, for your strength and your youth. you give me a headache. We were on the right track, right? -Why didn't you want me to shine? I did not want that you made your illusions. I'm going to jump at the Air and Stylie, what I always wanted. That is not an illusion. it is the competition of Europe. They are waiting for me. I'm waiting for you too. -but I'll never come back. I will not let you down. Live your own life. Leave me alone. What are you going to do with that? -The Air and Stylie raid. What beautiful hair you have. how do you get it so soft? -with my new shampoo. Dear God, it's him. - you should talk to him. How handsome. -Who is that? Go talk to him. - Otherwise I want it. What a sweetheart. how are you? -Hi. Fancy a ride? -I can't, I have class. And according to the director I am often absent. You don't have one for me yet have to skip school. Is that what you want as proof? -if proof of what? I'm coming. I'm going to get changed. Are you waiting here? Go backwards. Stop. Stop. Hi. how are you? I have done nothing wrong. I've never jumped so high. Copy from your video. Forget my video. it's not about the height, but how you land. And keep your eyes open. you move too woody. you do your best too hard. Try again. What's the matter with you? -you move in a woody way. Don't bark at me like that. Excuse me. sorry. Try again. I'm done with it. I'm tired. tired? -yes, tired. I quit. I will never succeed. We start again. your last jump was almost perfect. - Now I have to be able to do it again. you don't want to try it at the Air and Stylie? I want to be like you. you're on the right track. Will I become a professional snowboarder? -What do you think that means you? you get used to a lifestyle, and if your level drops, you have to give it up. you have connections? brands that don't understand it. Sell ​​like Beshop? No thanks. I have my life there not devoted to. you will always be a star. - yes, a rock star. is someone here? yeah, is anyone here? -I'm coming. Hello, julie. may I know what's going on here? Why doesn't anyone tell me anything? won't he see me again? What is going on? -Gaspard no longer works here. he is in Gstaad. What is he doing there? -he wants to become a professional snowboarder. he works together with Josh Atterssen. have you seen him yet? -in Gstaad, yes. And? -he has changed a lot. in what sense? Why do you say that? I will you show that he has not changed. I'll get him back. Do you know where Ethel's room is? - Behind that wooden cabin, room 7. Don't get caught. What are you doing here? -I really wanted to see you. Strange, h�. i have been seeing you for weeks, but I don't know anything about you. I want to know who's behind that face is hidden. Why don't you ever talk about Josh? Why did he choose me? - Because you look like him. Hide yourself. There she is. you have to leave. She's coming back. Then come along. you're not josh. That's why do you like me, huh? I'm afraid of Josh. he wants to use Gaspard to even Win the Air and Stylie once. Gaspard thinks he is participating but just Josh becomes his double. I met Gaspard today. he confused me. Be silent. it's all right. just hold on. how is it possible? What do you want? -I'm looking for Gaspard. Gaspard, you have visitors. you have visitors. Stand up. Who is it? -I do not know. What are you doing here? Can I speak to you alone? -I have no secrets. What do you want? if i wanted it, I had said something. I don't recognize you. I just wanted to see you. you've seen me now. Go away. Go away. What did you want? get me back to Grenoble? I've had enough girls. Calm down. -Flap closed. you have to see yourself. You want me with a face like that? you have to see your face. it's over, I tell you. That's it. -What's the matter with you? Up the pot. -you can do it yourself, you bitch. Wait. Is everything alright? he doesn't always do that? -Anyway. he became that way. you don't know him. -That is not necessary. I end with the contradiction between the catholic church ... and Islam with its different caliphates. I also finish with the relationships between the two. Thank you, Ethel. please. Then accept it. you write well. What did you read? - Are you kidding me now? That he uses me as a double, that he told me something. Even you said nothing. I'm out of here. I do not want you to leave. I do not want you to leave. are you kidding me? -No. Stay here. I beg you. What is the point? Someday it will end. If I stay, you will come with me. Agreed? -Yes. Are we going to the ramp? -No, to the mat�vas. Do you come? how did you handle it your idol is on the ground. What do you think of that? how did you handle it you would have done anything to maintain this little life, even that. Why did you want to break me? I stay to look like you. you don't need me anymore. you're better now. This is my last competition. Late end up with my head held high. Be silent. Be silent. if you don't do it for me, then do it for her. you can't go back. it's your life. Stand up. I jump to qualify. you will come to the final. And Ethel? She will be at the checkout. She takes you to the cloakroom. And the cops? -you enter through the emergency exit. welcome to the Air and Stylie. The next rider is Josh Atterssen. he hit last year his sponsor on arrival. Is he doing it again now? Josh Atterssen. with this great jump Josh qualifies for the final. Awesome. There are the four riders who compete in the final Air and Stylie. Marc-Andr� Dupont from Canada.
