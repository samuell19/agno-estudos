Michelle screamed as loud as she could as she ran through the graveyard. But if anyone heard her, they didn't answer. As soon as she found herself in front of the old mausoleum, Michelle had no choice. She had to go inside and look for help. She opened the creaking door and crept slowly into the lobby. She called out. Again, there was only silence. Then suddenly behind her she heard a sound. She turned around, and saw her boyfriend Steve... with his belt wrapped around his neck, hanging from the back of the door. And he was drenched in blood! - What happened next? - He screwed her. - Nice language. - Hey, listen to this. There's this fried chicken place down the road from my house, and my sister's best friend got served a fried rat. No way. I've heard this story a thousand times. I know a true story. There used to be this camp about 60 miles from here. - Camp Arawak. - Yeah, I heard about that, - and all these kids got killed. - Shut up. Like the little brat was saying... All these kids started getting killed. A bunch of little kids were hatcheted to death. And a girl got stabbed while taking a shower. One of the cooks got boiled in some water. Mmm, tasty! The owner of the camp, he got it in his neck with an arrow. Well, it ended up that the killer was this shy 14-year-old girl that everybody picked on, except she wasn't- Phoebe, you're supposed to be in the cabin. Let's go. - Just a second. - Except this girl, she wasn't a girl. Phoebe, let's go. She was really a he. His aunt had been dressing him up like a girl ever since he was four years old. If you don't get over here right now- Keep your shirt on! They found him naked on the beach, holding the chopped-off head of another camper. Jesus. About 30 people were killed and the camp had to be closed down. The end! Ready? Wait! What happened to the killer? I heard two stories. One that he's dead, and two that he's in Hollywood, playing the dark-haired girl on The Facts of Life. Bullshit. - She's alive. - It's a guy. Not anymore. He went into a psycho ward a couple years ago. And while he was there, the doctors gave him a sex change, and our parents' taxes paid for it! Well, he or she or whatever got out a couple years ago. How do you know about this? My dad's a cop. He helped arrest her. Actually, Sean is dating her. That still doesn't mean that he can't be in Hollywood. - Let's get him! Get him! - Stop! Quit it! Quit it! It's only the second week of camp and you're already getting into trouble. Give me a break. All I did was- All you did was sneak away from the cabin to be with the boys! Angela, T.C. was there and he's the head counselor. Slut. And then you tell that awful story, scaring those kids half to death. You don't deserve to be at camp. I should send you home. I don't believe this. Screw you, Angela! If you want to send me home, fine. See if I care. Shit. I can't see any damn thing. Damn it. This isn't the way back. Angela! Angela, come on. I... I'm sorry. Where the hell are you? Right here. That's what you get for not obeying your counselor. And here's what you get for telling evil stories and having such a filthy mouth. What a bad camper. Wake up, everybody. Breakfast in half an hour. What are you staring at? Haven't you ever seen a pair of boobs before? Aw, leave her alone, Ally. I mean, she's only looking at that long black hair growing out of your left nipple. - Ha, ha. - Hey, where's Phoebe? Hey, all her stuff's gone. Did you see her come in last night? - No, no, not me. - Hey, what about you guys? Wasted! Maybe she got smart. Ran away. I had to send her home. What? I had no choice. I found her doing things with the boys last night that she had no business doing. I know the rest of you are nice young ladies and you won't get into any trouble. And Ally. I'm sure we'd all agree that you have nice breasts. But I'd appreciate it if you wore a nightgown to bed from now on. I always sleep in the nude. Nice girls don't have to show it off. Okay, let's get showered. - Poor Phoebes. - Forget her, she's lucky. - She got to go home. - I wonder what she did? Must have been pretty serious. Maybe she got naked in front of the boys. Remember, ladies: Nice girls don't have to show it off. God, what's Angela's problem? I mean, who's going to see me, anyway? The tit patrol, that's who. - Get anything good? - Ally and Mar. - Alright. - Man. I love this camp. You know, I was really surprised at Phoebe, Uncle John. She seemed like she was such a good girl. Well, you did what you had to do. What did her parents say? What could they say? I'm sure it's not pleasant hearing your daughter tries to seduce every boy at camp. I used to brag that every good kid in New York came here, and now I have trouble filling half the cabins with God knows who. Whatever happened to the good kids in the world? Oh, don't talk like that, Uncle John. There's lot's of good kids, we just have to weed out the bad. Get a life. Here you go, Leia. Just keep your tits growing. Maybe you'll quit looking at mine. You're not supposed to give food away. I'm telling, Ally- Good morning, campers. (Hi, A")!- What, no breakfast? Right, like I'm gonna eat that shit? Well, the eggs are runny, but the oatmeal's okay. Oh, come on. The oatmeal looks as gross as the shit sisters. The shit sisters? Jodie and Burke Schote. Schote, shit, get it? They look like they're stoned all the time. They are. Not that getting stoned can't be fun. Just not all the time. So, uh, Molly... Do you get stoned? No. Good girl. Hey, did you hear what happened to Phoebes? Yeah, tough breaks. What's the big, bad thing she did, anyway? Nothing, just sat and talked. That's it? At least once she was with us. God, I thought Angela was gonna kill her. How do you put up with that bitch? She's not that bad. Oh, come on Molly, you've got to admit she's a little bit weird. Weird isn't even the word for it. I think she's a dyke. I'm totally serious. - Good morning, campers. - Good morning, Uncle John. Let's start this lovely day with a lovely song from our lovely Angela Johnson. Before she does, let's all congratulate her for being counselor of the week! She kicks out Phoebes and they make her counselor of the week? Thank you. I don't know what to say. I was once a camper myself. But it wasn't anything like this. Camp Rolling Hills is the best! Can I have Molly Nagel and Ally Burdus up here to help me with our morning song? - No. - Come on, Al. Go on up. Okay. We'll do my favorite: The Happy Camper song. Don't forget the hand movements. Oh, I'm a happy camper. I love the summer sun. I love the trees and forests. I'm always having fun. Oh, I'm a happy camper. I love to see the sky. And with the grace of God, I'll camp until I die. Hey Diane, can I get a picture with you? Sure, Charlie. - Say cheese. - Cheese! Perfect. Come on. Okay, everyone that's going on the nature hike, let's go! Everybody else get dressed for swimming and meet T.C. down by the pool. Let's go! And watch out for the ledges, I don't want anyone falling off. Yo, Angela. Angela, congratulations. - Thanks, T.C. - Yeah. You know, I was thinking. Today's your day off and everything but I was thinking if you'd like to come down to the pool and swim- Oh, no thanks. I'm really not a very good swimmer. You could use a little work on your tan. Maybe we should just get together sometime and talk. I mean, it's your first year here, you probably have a lot of... You want a piece? I hate green gum. You know, I'd really like to discuss what happened between you and Phoebe sometime. Oh, sure, we can do that. I'll talk to you later. I'll call you. Where are you gonna call me? I don't have a phone. So how long have you been coming here? Oh, about three years. God, you must really like it. It's okay. It's better than staying home. You don't get along with your folks? They're divorced. I live with my dad. We get along okay. But he's a young guy. He needs some time to himself. I guess this way we both get our summer break. - Where's your mom? - San Diego. She split when I was 7 years old. She couldn't handle my dad being a cop, so she moves to California and marries some jerk foot doctor. Hey, how about you? Your parents still married? Yeah, 26 years. - Got any brothers or sisters? - Lots. I have three brothers and two sisters. Everyone calls us the Brady Bunch. So I'm the youngest. I heard they say the youngest is supposed to be pretty spoiled. Is that true? Sometimes. I heard cops' kids are supposed to be pretty wild. Is that true? Sometimes. You know, the newspapers say I'm the best soccer player. Lyons Township has had in the past seven years. Great. You know, I've been on the honor roll every semester except for one. And I play the saxophone, too. Rob Durango. If you throw me in that water I'll kill you. Oh, yeah? Woo! Yeah. Hey, Emilio! Party hats at two o'clock. Alright! So you want to go get something to drink? Oh, I'm a happy camper. I love the trees and sky. But only when I'm shitfaced, and everyone gets high! Oh, I'm a happy camper. I love to drink and fuck. And if you pay me money on my titties you can suck. Morning, Angela. Have you seen the Schote sisters? No, they weren't at breakfast. Come to think of it, neither was Ralph. Thanks. Morning, T.C. Get out of here! Hi, Angela. What the fuck?! You know, it's one thing to screw up your own life. But you also screwed up your sister's. - Let this be a lesson to you. - No, please. Say “no” to drugs. I hate this place! I want to go home! What's the matter? Don't you like to paint? No, I want to go home! I hate this place! Let me go home. Maybe you're tired. You want to just - lie down for a little while? - NO- Listen to me. I told you I want to go home. Let me go home! I think I can arrange that. Let me go. Just leave me alone. Alright. Jeez. Well, I hope you come back next year. No way. Well, you can't please everybody. Two down and 38 to go. Um, four down. I sent the Schote sisters home this morning. I found them getting high and fornicating with one of the boys. You sent them home? Angela, talk to me or T.C. before doing things like that. Like I just did? - That was good. - Okay. - What about a can of beer? - No thanks, I don't drink. I'll walk you, though! Come on. I guess you've all heard by now I've had to send the Schote sisters home. No big loss. I have a counselor's meeting in a few minutes. I hope there won't be any problems when I'm gone. Good night. Dyke. So, Molly, what's this I hear about you and Sean? What did you hear? Everyone knows you like him. I wouldn't kick him out of bed. That's impossible, because if you were in the bed he wouldn't be. Shh! Did you hear that? There's somebody out there. I don't hear anything. It's probably Angela spying on us. See? I told you. Hey, who's out there? Just us monsters! It's a panty raid! ' Shh it! . No! Stop it! Give it to me! Give me my stuff! Give back my bra! Give me my bra! Give me back my bra! Uncle John's gonna hear about this. You're all in big trouble. Get out of here. You know, they weren't doing anything wrong. They were just having some fun-- Get out of here! I don't like being the Wicked Witch of the West. But I know what happens when things get out of control. Get this place cleaned up! That's mine. I'll get Yo"! My pretty. And your little dog, too! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Who says we get the boys back tonight? - Oh... - Yeah, yeah, yeah! Not tonight, no! She's really angry. Who gives a shit? Besides, if we do it at two or three in the morning she's not gonna find out. You want to? - Yeah, yeah! - Okay, what do we do? Jockstraps. Alright, alright, alright! Call me when it's over. I think we better get out of here! Yeah, but while we're here we want our bras and panties back! Don't tickle me! Stop it! No, please! Oh, don't tickle me! Come on now! Well, if you don't give them back to us, you're gonna be seeing a lot of this! You know, you don't have to go home. I want to go home. I'm sorry you feel that way. Because even though you did a cheap, disgusting act by exposing your breasts, I really think that you didn't know any better. You were just trying to impress everybody, - especially Ally. - I was not. Sure you were. Mary... You don't have to go through life as a tagalong. Why don't you just try being yourself? My name is not Mary, it's Mar! I hate that name. I'm giving you one last chance, Mar. We're sleeping out tomorrow night. I'd love to have you there. Just say you're sorry. Never. I would rather die first, Angela. What are you looking for, a gun? No. A drill. Asshole. You guys better not play with your food. Yeah, or you're gonna tell! Oh, look at her over there! Yeah, we'll get her. Tonight, when y'all are camping out. - Right, Anthony? - We'll scare her to death. Want to help, Rob? No, not tonight. I've got a date. With who? His left hand. How about you, Sean? Want to help? I don't know. Maybe. Hey, you seem to be pretty busy these days, if you know what I mean. Let me have your attention, campers. T.C. would like to have a word with you. Good morning, T.C.! Good morning, campers. Yes, I would like to have a word with you. Thank you, Uncle John. Before we get started today, I would like to read over a list of things that are missing. Please pay close attention. One Camp Rolling Hills sweatshirt, one blue and white striped beach towel, One first aid kit, one pair of black Ray-Ban sunglasses, a saw, 50 feet of rope, the battery from my car... A portable electric drill, 10 pairs of panties, three bras. We've been a busy boy, haven't we, Rob? And four athletic supporters. Yeah, one of those are mine. Oh, which one? The bras or the panties? Touche. Hey, I got a joke. Listen. Where do you store lint from belly buttons? - Where? - In the navel reserve. - Hilarious. - Yeah, that's really funny. Hey, you want to hear this? Okay, like I was playing soccer once in this game, and I was running, and this guy came to trip me... HI- - Molly. - You want some company? How did you know I was up here? I followed you. Hope you don't mind. No, of course not. It's so pretty up here, isn't it? Yeah. Have you ever been in there? No, you can't. It's all boarded up. So, you didn't come all the way up here for nothing. - Is there something wrong? - We"... Does it have to do with you and Sean? Mmhm. He's a nice kid. Even if he did talk back to me. You like him a lot, don't you? Mmhm. But Ally likes him too. Oh, don't worry about Ally. Sean's smart. He knows a good thing when he sees it. Yeah, but she's so popular. She's even a cheerleader. So? Well, guys like to go out with cheerleaders. I tried out for it, but I didn't make it. I guess I just didn't cheer loud enough. I'm so shy sometimes. I used to be shy. - I'd never talk to anyone. - You? Now you can't get me to shut up. It's more than that. Ally... She's more experienced. Which means she probably has a disease or two. - Angela! - Well... In this day and age, you can't be too careful. And no matter what they say, boys like nice girls. I'm still a virgin. And I'm proud to be one. But I feel so awkward. I don't know what to do. Well... There's a saying that my aunt taught me. It's helped me through a lot of hard times, and it goes like this: Keep your morals strong and you'll never go wrong. Okay. - I gotta get back. - Have I been any help? - Lots. - Good. Gimme a hug. Let's go. Gross slimy gopher guts! Look out! Putrid round elephant hearts. Dead teenager brains. Angela. What's really in there? Dead teenagers' brains. Hey, grab some paint. I got this idea about a year ago. If this doesn't scare Angela, nothing will. How's your glove coming? - Almost finished. - Mine's gonna be great. Angela gonna dookie in her pants. - Check it out. - What is it? Picture of Mar. I got it right before she took a shower. Man, it's out of focus. You can still tell what it is. Look at this one. This is in focus. What are you looking at? No... What do you mean? Let me see. Um, nothing to see. Let me see what you have in your hand. Come on. Uncle John's gonna hear about this. Was Angela's picture in those? Yes. Aw, shit. Nice tits. - Go ahead and joke. - I-- But I never thought pornography was funny. You're right, you're right. I'm ashamed of myself. - I'll handle it. - They should be sent home. No, there's no way. Uncle John would never go for that. Charlie and Emilio have been coming here for years. Don't worry, I'll handle it. Oh, by the way, you, uh, might want to keep your eyes and ears open tonight, I think a couple of the kids are gonna try to scare you. I overheard them talking about it. Don't worry. I'll handle it. Now this will give Angela one hell of a nightmare. L Bu“! Angela's missing all the fun. I can't believe she forgot her pillow. You know, I thought we were supposed to be roughing it. I mean, we're not even supposed to need a pillow. I wonder where the boys are. Weren't they supposed to scare us? They're supposed to scare Angela, so act surprised. Wouldn't it be funny if they showed up and she wasn't even here? I hope they don't show, 'cause all they're gonna do is get us in trouble, and my folks will strangle me if I get sent home. Oh, hell! Turn that song up. Hey, you know you've got pretty good taste, yeah? For a white suburban cheerleader. Thanks. Hey! Asshole, you almost broke my machete. Help me find my glove. Damn, where'd you put it? If I knew that, I'd have it. Listen, I'm going to take a piss. If you don't have that glove by the time I get back, - I'm leaving without you. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, where'd you find it? Hey, faggot, where are you? Anthony, come on. I'm leaving without you. Anthony? Anthony? What'd you do that for, Anthony? Oh my God! No. Please, no! Sorry. Once I start a task I always finish. Hey, what's the name of this group? You know, they're really good. I don't know, but I won't turn them off, don't worry. I'm so glad you went and got some more jumbo hot dogs. They're all beef. Alright! - Angela! - Surprise! It's not nice to scare people. So you did know about the boys. But I don't think they're gonna be showing up. I gotta hand it to you. I didn't think you'd do something like this. Oh, you'd be surprised. Where's Ally? She went to the restroom. She said something about having cramps. I'll bet. Oh my God. Oh, wow. God. It's here. Ally, are you in there? Oh, shit! Fuck. Stop it! Ally. God. Quick, hide. Where, in the can? I don't care. Move! - Look, stand on top of it. - God. Hurry. Uh, Angela, I've got cramps, real bad. You said you had cramps last week. Yeah, well, I've got 'em again. Runs in the family. Why is this door locked? I didn't want some crazy person to attack me. Cute... but the blood looks like ketchup. Hey. Hey. Have either of you guys seen Judd or Anthony? - No! - Damn it. What, haven't you seen them yet? No, they haven't been seen since last night. - You're kidding. - Can you help me look for them? Sure. If you see them, be sure to tell a counsellor. And tell the two of them I am extremely pissed off. - Okay. - I'll see you. Hey, Ally, you want to throw the ball? No. You don't have to pretend to be nice to me. I know you hate me as much as I hate you. I don't hate you. Don't give me that goody-goody shit. It may work on Sean Whitmore, but it's not going to work on me. Has he screwed you yet? That's none of your business. I didn't think he had. Well, let me warn you, he's a lousy lay. You'd be perfect together. Look, do me a favor and leave me alone. Don't forget to run and tell Angela. Maybe if I'm lucky the dyke will send me home. Molly? You want to talk about it? It's okay. What happened? Did you and Sean break up? No. - It's just that Ally... - What about Ally? She said she hated me. And then she said all these mean things about Sean. And about you. And then she said I'd probably come and tell you. So you can't say anything to her. You promise? I promise. Why don't you go swimming? You'd feel better if you got some fresh air. No, I can't. She'll probably be there. - I doubt it. - Where do you think she is? Probably fornicating. That was great. Thanks a lot. That was fun. Listen, you don't have AIDS or anything, do you? - NO- - Great. See ya. Sean Whitmore... I knew you'd come around. Sean? Sorry I'm late. Sean? Shit. God damn Molly. God damn Angela. - What's your problem? - You, and kids like you. Very funny. I didn't think you'd fall for it. You're dumber than I thought. Yeah? Well you're more fucked up than I thought. Get up. Get up! Get in there. Get in the toilet! What's down there? - Answer me. - Shit. Shit. That's right, one of your favorite words. Well, do you mind if I borrow it for a moment? You've been a shitty friend and a shitty camper. What else is down there? - Answer me. - Piss. You've pissed away your good wits and. God-given talent your whole life, and turned into nothing but a cynical, dirty-mouthed, wasted flesh! What else is down there? I don't know! Well then I guess you're just going to have to climb in and find out. Leeches, Ally! For a leech like you. You should have been the first to go. Half hour to lights out. Hey, uh, have you guys seen Ally? No-' No- She had really bad cramps last night. I think she's still sick. - She didn't have cramps. - Yeah? How would you know? Rob, you gotta stay away from her. She is bad news. I'm gonna get a soda. Do you guys want anything? No. Great. - You want to play? - Sure. Man, you want to hear something weird? Yeah, what's that? I keep thinking about that camp. You know, where all the kids got killed? Oh, come on, Rob. Ally's not dead. She's probably out screwing the cook. Yeah, but what about Judd and Anthony? I don't know, they're on a beer run or something. Ally's probably with them. Don't worry about it. You know something? I almost went to Camp Arawak the year all those kids got killed. My dad, he couldn't afford it. - Oh, man, you're lucky. - You're telling me. I can't remember the name the killer went by as a girl. But I think she went by... Peter, Peter Baker. Yeah, everyone called him the Angel of Death 'cause they said he only killed bad people. So, uh... So tell me. How bad is Ally? - Pretty bad. - What do you got? - Just two pair. - Let me see them. A pair of these, a pair of these and this one left over. Jesus Christ. Hey, don't you dare get me wet. - Oh, we won't. - We won't. - Demi! Hi. - Hi! Is there something wrong? I don't know; I just had the strangest thing happen. Really? Tell me about it. Well, I was in the rec room, and I was bored. I was bored, and then I remembered. Mar gave me her phone number, so I decided to give her a call. Well, when I called and asked her mom if I could speak to her, she told me she was still here. So what did you do? I didn't want to cause any trouble, so I thanked her and I hung up. That's smart. No need to cause trouble. Well anyway, then I decided to call Phoebes, and Angela, it's the strangest thing. When I called her house, they told me the same thing. I talked to her little brother, and he said she was still at camp. Well, I asked him if he was sure. He said, "Sure, I'm sure." Then this man gets on the phone, and he tells me Phoebes is still at camp. Well, I was really worried about her, so I told him that you sent her home three days ago. Well he mumbled something, then Phoebe's mom got on the phone. Hey, what are you doing? Nothing, just fixing my guitar. Well, I wasn't real interested in talking to her, because I've heard some stories about her. Boy, supposedly she sleeps around a lot. Well anyway, I had to go through the whole story all over again, and do you know when I finished she told me she didn't believe me? Well, I told her it was true. Then she starts to tell me how Phoebes was never any good anyway, and how she hoped she ran away. Well, I didn't know what to say to her, so I thanked her. Then I got to thinking how this was all such a strange coincidence. So then I decided to call the shit sisters. You know something? You talk too much. Who locked the door? I'm going to tell. Somebody locked the door. Who's here? Ally, if that's you you're in trouble. You're not supposed to miss dinner. Demi, what are you doing? What did I do? I didn't do anything! You're gonna tell. No more whining. Kumbaya... Kumbaya, my lord, kumbaya. Kumbaya, my lord, kumbaya. Kumbaya, my lord, kumbaya. Kumbaya... Kumbaya, my lord, kumbaya. Looks like you and I are the only two left. Don't worry, we'll still have a good time. You sent all of them home? I had no choice. I had no choice... Keep your morals strong, and you'll never go wrong. There's still lots of good kids. We just have to weed out the bad. Well, it turned out that the killer was the shy 14-year-old girl that everybody picked on. We'll do my favorite: The Happy Camper Song. Okay, don't forget the hand movements. I'm a happy camper, I love the summer sun. I love the trees and forests, I'm always having fun. Oh, I'm a happy camper. I love the big blue sky. And with the grace of God, I'll camp until I die. You're more fucked up than I thought. You're fired. I'm sorry to have to say this. But I've told you before nobody is to be sent home without my permission. Well, I'm not sorry. Yesterday I spent the entire day looking for Judd and Anthony. I even called the police. I was afraid they were dead. What if I said that I was sorry and that I wouldn't do it again. I want you out of here before lunch. Good morning, Angela. Uncle John and T.C. just fired me. Diane will be your new counselor. What? I have to go be by myself for a while. I came to say goodbye. - Morning. - Hi, is Sean here? Yeah. Hey, Sean, you've got company. Yeah. Hey. Good morning. Sorry. Yeah, what's up? So last night, Angela sent the other girls home. And then this morning she tells me she was fired. - Good. She's crazier than hell. - Rob! Man, I'm sorry. She's real upset. I was hoping we could help her out. We? H Ow? I don't know, just talk to her, anything. - What do you want me for? - I just do. Where is she? Well, she's at this spot a mile or so from here. It's up in the hills near this old deserted cabin. I know she goes there a lot. Alright. Rob. Tell T.C. I'm out with Molly. Come on. You owe me one. - M. - M. How you doing? Uncle John makes me counselor of the week just four days ago. And now he fires me? - Maybe we could talk to him. - No. It's over. Besides, T.C. had just as much to do with it. T.C. hates me. - No, he doesn't. - Yes, he does. We never got along well. Her reminds me of this boy that I knew when I was about your age. He didn't like me very much, either. - But I fixed him. - How? I drowned him. Hey, I wonder what's in here. - It's locked. - No, it's not. Don't go in there! Why Not? Ew, what's that smell? I don't want to hurt you. Ouch! Where did they go? To that old cabin up in the woods about a mile from here. Alright, alright. I'll be back in an hour. Angela is about to get her ass kicked. Bitchin'. Alright. I always like to read the ingredients before I buy anything. You'd be surprised what they put in food these days. I mean, some of that stuff is poison. Too bad they haven't figured out a way to make French fries nutritious. I'm a nut when it comes to French fries. Sean! Molly! I think we have company. Sean! Molly! Angela! And just in time for lunch. Oh my God. Would you like a second cup? I knew your battery would come in handy. Now, who's hungry? Hungry, Molly? Well, I know a growing boy like you has got to be hungry. There. Come on. Open UP- Angela. Yes? You're Angela Baker. The Angel of Death. Should've called you Peter. My name is Angela Johnson. You're Angela Baker! You killed all those kids at Camp Arawak. I've been Angela Johnson for four years. How did you get this job here? Easy. I've got great recommendations. From doctors, psychiatrists, even clergymen. I did my time. Two years of therapy. Electroshock. It was every kind of pill you ever heard of, plus an operation. I'm completely cured. If I wasn't they wouldn't have let me out. How do you know so much about me? My dad's a cop. He helped arrest you. You should have heard him the day you got out. That's too bad. Wait'll he hears what's happened to you. Molly, honey. You haven't eaten a thing all day. Aren't you hungry? You gotta eat sometime. Even if you're sad, you gotta eat. Isn't that right, Leia? Don't worry. As my aunt always says, there's plenty of fish in the sea. Anyway, Sean wasn't good enough for you. He was always back talking. Speak of the devil! Look who's on T.V.! I gotta go. I'll be back in a few minutes, and T.C. and Sean can keep you company. Oh, I'm a happy camper, I love the summer sun. Enjoy the party, Matt. Your girlfriend is in here. Molly, stop! I won't hurt you! Molly! Stop! I just want to be your friend! Won't you just leave me alone? Give me the knife. Just give me the knife. Give me the knife. Give me the knife. Molly! Poor Molly. If it's any consolation... You almost made it. Molly? You guys; He!!- What have I told you about this? John! John! John! On, God! Good night, campers. I love the trees and forests, I'm always having fun. Thanks for picking me up. Yep. Ain't no skin off my tits. Besides, a girl like you shouldn't be alone on this road. I mean, if you're going to get screwed, you'd like to know who you're being screwed by, right? I quit these things so many times, I had to quit quitting. Mind cracking a window? Boss gotta boss. I mean, the way I see it, I'm just too dumb to drink, and I'm too fat to fuck. Oh, thank god you're here! Howdy, partner!
