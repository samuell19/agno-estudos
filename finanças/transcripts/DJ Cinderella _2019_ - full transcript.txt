[pop music plays] CINDERELLA POP [Cíntia] This is me, making my dream of being a successful DJ come true. Cíntia, wake up. Wake up, Cíntia! [Cíntia] And this is Patrícia. She's always crushing my dreams. - Cíntia, wake up. - ["Waltz of the Flowers" plays] Sleeping at your parents' party? What will people think? That you are a phony who's going to destroy my family's happiness. That is what I should have said. But as I still didn't know what was about to happen, I said, You are right, Patrícia. You're the best. I'm going for a walk. Bye. ["Waltz of the Flowers" continues] [jazz music plays] [Cíntia] Life at my house was always a party. These two are my parents. So beautiful and in love... In my family, everybody believed in love. - Men are terrible! - [Cíntia] What's wrong, auntie? Rafa got jealous because I talked to the waiter! [Cíntia] Everybody but aunt Helena. Is he the one who pays my bills? Isn't he? He is now. But only until I make it as Brazil's most important Concrete poet! - Oh, auntie... - No one is buying my freedom. I'm getting another juice, but not because I have to! Wow, Cíntia, you look gorgeous! You look like a princess. And you look like two ghosts from a horror movie. I'd love to have said that to Patrícia's vain daughters. But I said... You both also look great. - Sorry. - [boy] Sorry. Hi, Rafa. This is the surprise I prepared for my parents. Is this your arrangement? The couple's song is going to be much better. [Cíntia] That's the idea. Do you think they'll like it? Smooth, Cíntia. You are always great. Go ahead. [Cíntia] Rafa is a real character. Aunt Helena and he are a case of opposites who make a perfect couple. They say love is like this: when it strikes, it strikes. Ouch! [Freddy] That's me: Freddy Prince. And now I'm going to tell my version of this party. Bonjour, gorgeous people. Today, Belinha's Channel will show you Dorella's family mansion. We'll see how rich people party, how they dance, how they dress, how they eat... To find all that out, follow me. Done, Bê. No more complaining now. Let's go back there? I have to play. I think you should give up this string quartet thing and focus on your music. Classical music is only lucrative in Germany. In Germany and at this party - the money is great. - I'm going to use it to record my song. - Cheap bastard. Besides, if I hadn't accepted this job, you wouldn't be here recording exclusive content for your little channel with 6 followers. Someday I will be famous and you will beg me to play your song on my channel. I'll let you know if I'll allow you to play my song. Keep dreaming! I need to change shoes before the end of the break. The client demanded dress shoes. I think I have mine in my backpack. There's plenty of time. Let's try to find someone interesting. - I'm working, Bê. - That's all you think about! You stay at home writing songs about the perfect love. "Oh, where is my princess?" You need to find a princess in the flesh. These people have nothing to do with me. Look at them. You're right. It won't be easy. - Sorry. - Sorry. The quartet guys are back. Go play while I record the surroundings. Has the break finished? What are we playing now? You won't play anything if you don't change your shoes. Go ahead, take those off. No, I'm not going to. You don't own this house. You work for the owner. A stuck-up secretary. You're not the boss, and you don't have manners. I would have said that if I knew who she was. - Go ahead, take those off. - Yes, right away. The powerful command, those with sense obey. [Patrícia] That's it. Robson, station yourself here. So... I forgot my dress shoes at home. - We have a problem. - Who is "we", boy? You have a problem. Look around you, honey. See? This party is for distinguished people, got it? - No, I didn't. - People like me, chic, elegant-- - Rude. - No. Sincere. Which can mean the same thing, depending on the situation. And your situation is this: find a decent pair of shoes or get out. OK, but can you give my shoe back, please? Lost your rhythm, music boy? Do you want your sneaker? Get it. Here. Go get it. Ouch! Cíntia! Oh, my God! - Are you OK? Did you hurt yourself? - No, I'm fine. Some foolish musician came with sneakers, but I'm kicking him out right now. This is silly, Patrícia. Let him play like that. What's the problem? [jazz music continues] [Patrícia] What an unbearable girl! How long will I have to put up with her? What about me, Mom? She has more of everything than I do. More clothes, shoes, handbags, allowance... - The only thing I have more-- - Is envy. That's something. Calm down, my sweet daughters. Our story will change. You can bet on it. You mean on Instagram? What? It could be on Facebook! Who knows? - Jesus... - Look. It's starting. [applause] [Cíntia plays "Für Elise"] [music changes from original version] Wow, this is very good. César! César... Come here, honey. What's got into you? Sorry, Dad. I wanted to surprise you. I thought you'd like it. Like it? You destroyed Beethoven with your... God knows what! Calm down, César! You embarrassed me. - Dad... - Calm down. You rocked. That spoiled brat deserved it! If I had a powerful father like her... Do you want to have the regal life that girl doesn't value? Come with me. You stay. I didn't summon you. Come. [malicious giggle] You know what you have to do, right? Now go hide. César! [César] How humiliating! A distinguished man like you didn't deserve that. But I'm here, my love. I'm always here by your side. I didn't want this party. You know that. [Patrícia] I know. [César] But Ana wanted it so much. - I'm not complaining, am I, cupcake? - No. I'm not saying, "Leave your wife. I deserve this good life. My daughters need a father. Be a man and admit that I'm the one for you, you fool." Am I saying that? Of course not. You are an angel. - [César] You would never say that. - [Patrícia] Never. [Patrícia] Your love is enough. Forgive your father, honey. You know what he's like. He values tradition. He's wrong, Ana. And so are you. You gave up your archeologist career to marry a fossil. - Helena... - Was it to compensate? It was love. Have you heard of it? We give some things up for love. And, to this day, I do not regret marrying César. [dramatic music plays] [gasping] César... Until today, right? [Cíntia] That's when I stopped believing in love. ♪ So close, too far ♪ ♪ Wherever you are ♪ ♪ I don't wanna know, not anymore ♪ ♪ We could have been ♪ ♪ All of our dreams ♪ ♪ But maybe a dream is just a dream ♪ ♪ Please, don't try to reach me ♪ ♪ I have nothing to say ♪ ♪ But maybe it's better that way ♪ [Cíntia] I learned from my mother that we need to look forwards. Two years after we left my father's house, we felt that our dreams had no limits. [Ana] I'm glad you got here on time, honey. I thought you wouldn't. Of course I'd come, Mom. I'll miss you so much. You and your crazy aunt. After all, I stayed here for a while. Two years, right? Two years are not two days. I got used to having you around. - This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. - I know. You worked hard to get the scholarship. Archeology was always your passion. Since we were children. She'd look for bones and say they were from mummies. And grandma would say, "This is the bone from the chicken we had for lunch!" What a beautiful family I got for myself. He speaks as if we were married. Are you mocking me, my cuddly one? I promise I'll be fine, Mom. Follow your dreams and I'll follow mine: to study music in London. You'll manage it, honey. I know you will. Cíntia will be a star. I have a lot of faith in her future. Me too. - [Ana] Take care of her. - [Helena] Have a nice trip. I will. [Ana] Thank you. - Bye, Mom. - Goodbye, my love. Be good and take care. You too. [sad pop music plays] THE INTERNET KING OF ROMANTIC BALLADS Did you remember the fox? Fox? There's no fox to be remembered. Are you crazy? What do you mean? The mouse. You must feed him. Oh, that Fox. Only you would name a mouse Fox. I named it after the guy who gave it to me. He was such a fox. You and your boyfriends. By the way, wasn't he the one who vanished? No, that was the dog. He gave me this cat. In his honor-- You named the cat Dog. This parakeet was given to me by an ex who was completely worthless. Have I told you about him? If the parakeet's name is Cockroach, you don't have to. Cíntia, in life only one thing is true: animals have pedigrees, but all men are mutts. That's why my motto now is "I date, but I don't get attached." This goes for Rafa as well. Did you say something, honey? You say that, but you've been together for two years. No attachment there. [Helena] Don't be silly, Cíntia. I want to know what you guys think of my new concrete poem. - I want to hear. - [Helena] Listen up! The rock The carcass The bagasse The game and the hide The dictatorship and the denture [speaks hoarsely] That imprisons and makes the voice fail Of me, of us, of you Of the turtle's song! So? Do turtles sing, auntie? It's not in that sense. I mean a song for the turtle. Oh, I get it now. It's all very concrete, right? You rocked, honey. I loved it. You are incredible. Give me a kiss, my cuddly one. I'm not cuddly, Rafa! Jesus! Helena, wait. - What did I do? - You were cute. Cute and concrete don't go together. - Each with his own talent, right? - Forget it. She's being silly. Speaking of talent, let's use our spare time to practice. Sure! [pop music plays] Your turn. Keep marking the tempo. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Pump up the volume, then lower the bass. Slowly. Again. Nice one! [music intensifies] - [music gets quieter] - Very good! Great! You nailed it! If you keep this up and get good grades, you will easily get the scholarship in London. Rafa, you could let her play at some parties to practice. I'll try. - OK. Don't cling to me. I need some air! - [cell phone beeps] [Lara] Cíntia, I'm almost there. Let's go to school. Lara, I wish I could skip class and keep learning from Rafa. But I can't. I have to go, Cíntia. We'll practice more later. Stay a while and listen to another concrete poem. Lara, wait up. I'm coming. The green, the plant, the photosynthesis. One, two, three, four... [Cíntia] Good morning. - Hello. - What's up? Let's go? Let's. Isn't cycling good for making your legs thin? Better than pretending to work out just to post photos at the gym. Ignore her. Leave it, Graziele. Do not tease. But she made fun of me! Against the truth there are no arguments. Don't push it, Gisele. - I'm not pushing, Mom. - But you should, to lose weight. - Mom, what the hell? - The truth hurts but makes you stronger. Now get out, both of you. - Go, Graziele. - Hurry up. Guess who's going to play at my birthday party? Our birthday party, Graziele. We are twins. But not from the same father. And how is that possible? Gisele, my angel, there must be some genetic reason that explains why I am so perfect and you are so... that. Stop it! Let me tell the news to the girls. Guess who's going to play at my party? Who? Get lost. You are not invited. Freddy Prince! In the flesh, verse and prose. ♪ Let it go, let me love ♪ ♪ Let it bleed ♪ ♪ Let my soul and your voice sing ♪ ♪ Make me happy now ♪ ♪ Make me happy now... ♪ [Freddy] After I started posting my songs on the internet, I found out that a lot of people still want to hear about love. I soon started getting invited to perform, to sign with music labels and even to go on an international tour. ♪ For my soul swells ♪ ♪ As my love swells ♪ ♪ For my soul swells ♪ ♪ As my love... ♪ ♪ swells ♪ Your fans will freak out. It's perfect. It's better, but there's still something missing. What's missing is you going out, seeing people... You need to enjoy your success a bit. You speak of love, but you need to stop idealizing it and, I don't know... Start living. Get a girlfriend. I don't want a boyfriend, Mom. What I want is to chase my dreams. OK, honey. Now let me tell you something. We found remnants of the mummy of a queen miles away from the mummy of a king. Can you believe it? See? Even the mummies want nothing to do with men. Speaking of mummies, can you believe Dad enrolled Patrícia's daughters at my school? And they have the nerve to call him "Dad" in front of everybody. Come on, Mom! Honey, I can't talk right now. I have to go. But take care, my love. - l love you. - Bye. I miss you and love you. Hi. Did you know that Freddy Prince is going to play at my birthday party? Really? So what? I don't like his songs. - She doesn't like his songs! - Right. That's great. Now you have an excuse not to go. After all, it was Dad who invited you. If it was up to me, you wouldn't even go. As if I would leave the house to see Freddy Prince playing his cheesy music. I like Freddy's music. His lyrics are so beautiful! How I wish André would say those things to me... Depressing lyrics. "I'll say good morning to the sea, my heart is quiet, love at first sight." For someone who doesn't like his songs you know the lyrics quite well. Of course. I don't criticize unknowingly. It is precisely because I heard them that I know they suck. Hi, Cíntia. How are you doing, cutie? Hi, boys. We were talking about going to see a movie together. What do you say, André? What are you talking about? Lara, I've moved on. I'm sorry. Did you see the app we created? Well, I created more. It's called VibraCheat. - What's that? - Duh! It's an app to help cheating. [André] It's simple. A long vibration means the question number. And a short vibration means the answer, like A, B, C, D. Easy, right? - No. It's easier to study for the exams. - It is if you like to study. Let's go. If you keep this up, he's going to give up on you. And he should. What a stupid app. You need therapy, you know that? "My parents split up. I'm traumatized. I don't like anybody. Blah blah blah." And you? Asking André out completely out of the blue. Lara, he's not into you. That's what you think. I know he loves me. He even promised to marry me. Right. When you two were seven years old. So what? Kids are sincere, OK? And I'm the one who needs therapy? I'm off. [Helena] Cíntia, hurry up! Come here! Rafa called asking you to play at a party right now! Now? In the middle of the afternoon? So what? It must be a really crazy pool party! Prepare your set. We will rock with your music on the dance floor! [slow samba music plays] Auntie, define "a really crazy pool party." That idiot Rafa will pay for this. But look on the bright side: you are building an audience. I'll eat something. Hey, record-player girl. Can you please turn down the volume? I don't hear anything else. - Sorry, lady, but if I turn it down-- - What? If I turn it down, nobody will be able to listen to the music. I will complain to the host of the party. What's your name again? - Cíntia Dorella. - Cinderella? That's right: DJ Cinderella. I can't believe it... Cinderella? That's horrible. DJ Cinderella. Beautiful, wonderful, marvelous...! - [Gisele] Do I look pretty, Mom? - I was referring to myself. Wow, I look great! Gisele, my angel, see this beautiful mask? - It's gorgeous. - Wear it. It will make you look beautiful. Graziele, stop pestering your sister. It makes you uglier than she is. Sorry, I didn't mean it. I forgive you, Mom. I was apologizing to Graziele. Mom! Honey, inner beauty is also important. Inside, you are full of-- - Pounds. - Values! Your values weigh a lot, I mean, count a lot, OK? - My weight is normal, Mom. - Everybody is normal, Gisele. What sets us apart is our beauty. To be beautiful inside counts, but outside a few less pounds would do you good, got it? I disagree. The truth hurts but makes you stronger. - Why are you laughing? - Accept that you are fat! - I'm not fat! - Yes, you are! - [Patrícia] Hey! - [light-hearted giggling] Oh, dear, you are so beautiful. And you are charming. What about Mom? [Graziele and Gisele] She looks like an angel. [Patrícia] Oh, my beautiful girls... You know how humble I am. I have almost no vanity. César, there you are. Such beautiful women. You look like ladies of the court. That's the party's theme: an imperial court ball. - Do we look nice? - Gorgeous. How I wish Cíntia was like you. Good looking? No, honey. She is beautiful. I wish she was sweet, affectionate-- Let's talk about positive things. The girls want to thank you for hiring Freddy Prince to play at their 15th birthday party. There's no need. Aren't you his fans? Check this out. -[César] Wow! Does Cíntia like this guy? - That one doesn't like anyone. - What did you say? That he doesn't displease anyone. So handsome. I hope so. Now you'll have to excuse me. Daddy needs to go on a trip. - Oh, no, honey. I will miss you so much! - [disappointed whining] Bye. God, it took him a while this time. So many things to do for this party. Mom, Freddy has to love the party. Because I love him and I want to marry him. You and Freddy? You're crazy. That's impossible. Impossible is a place that doesn't exist, honey. "Far away is a place that doesn't exist" is how the saying goes. But you understood, right? I meant that there are no limits to our dreams. Look at me for example. I was a very poor girl. I had to work very hard to get what I wanted. To win the Miss Pool Piriri pageant I had to forge the result. What did I do? I found a way. The test to work at the firm? I stole the answers and got first place. What did I do? I found a way. Even to steal César's heart. Guess what I had to do? Do I need to say it? I found a way. I always find a way. I want to be just like you and do anything to win Freddy's heart. If that's what you want, that's what you're going to get. You only need focus. - And what do I need? - To lose weight. I don't need to lose weight. I told you, I'm normal. Honey, listen to your mother. No normal person loves themselves as they are. I'll book a session with your therapist, you need one. [short vibration] [short vibration] [long vibration] [short vibration] Was that three or four short vibrations? I think there were two short ones and one long one. Or one short one and two long ones? [throat clearing] You betrayed the trust the school placed in you. Using your cell phones to cheat? That is fraud! From now on cell phones are forbidden at school. - [angry murmuring] - What? What about my mom? That's absurd! Your parents have the school's number in case of any emergency. Yes, Cíntia. - But we can still use it at recess, right? - No. Recess is meant to be for socializing. Talk to each other. This is all your fault, you idiots. I won't calm down! How am I going to talk to my mom now? She always calls me during recess because of Japan's time zone. It's a 12-hour difference. Yes, you would have to time travel. I know. Talk to your dad. He's a big deal here. Wasn't it his firm that donated all the school's computers? I don't want to have to do that. But it's for a good cause. There's no way we can do without our phones. Poor André. He must be devastated. Forget him, Lara. You deserve better than that. - He couldn't care less about you. - It's love. What can I do? Have a little more love for yourself? This is why I want nothing to do with it, because I don't want to become an air-head like you. [light-hearted music plays] Hi, Rafa! What's up? Everything's smooth. I need to go on a last-minute trip. Could you play at a party for me? - For real? - Yes, for real. This time, it'll be a great party, I promise. The money is good, professional equipment, laser harp... You only have to play until midnight, which is perfect because you're underage. Of course, I'm in! Where are you playing? At a rave, in Recife! - You're kidding! That's great! - For real! Are you ready? You can trust me, Rafa. I am more than ready. I'm counting on you. Smooth. I'll text you the address. [Cíntia] Deal. [Cíntia] Hi, Domingos! [into cell phone] Lara, Rafa asked me to play at a party! There will be a lot of people, a laser harp... I still don't know where. He's going to text me, but I'm so excited! Scared of playing? I'm not easily scared, Lara-- - Ta-da! - [shocked scream] What's the matter, girl? Auntie... My outfit for tonight's presentation. Is it ugly? It's not that it's ugly... What presentation? With a group of Bolivians who loved my poems. - Did they understand them? - I don't understand the question. Forget it! Where is it going to be? At a very chic place. A clandestine casino. Auntie, casinos are forbidden. The law says so. It's forbidden to forbid. Caetano says that. So, did you like it? Isn't it perfect? - I amaze myself. - [cell phone ringing] DAD - [César] Cíntia? - Who else could it be, Dad? It's been hard to talk to you lately, honey. Are you there? I am. What do you want? To confirm that you are going to the twins' party. Honey, not all things are simple. - I know I made a mistake. - OK, I don't want to talk about that. Dad, I have a problem. What problem? They banned cell phones at school. It makes sense. I think it's great. It may be great for you, but it sucks for me. How am I going to speak to Mom in Japan? Well, I can solve this problem for you, in the same way that you can go to Gisele and Graziele's party. I sent you the invitation. Did you get it? And you said no to your father? I don't believe it! Of course I did. Imagine: blackmailed by my own father? That's just what I needed. And I wouldn't be able to go to that party anyway. I'm playing at another one. [electronic pop music plays] Hi. My name should be on the service list. I am the DJ. Cíntia! Dad? She's my daughter. Hi, honey. I'm so glad you decided to come to your sisters' party. Right, girls? And where is your costume? I... didn't know it was mandatory. Mandatory? Never. It would have been considerate of you, but what matters is that you are here. Right, girls? Exactly. I'll help you, honey. [girls hiss] How would I know it was the same party? By comparing the addresses, daft girl! I didn't even notice. I was not coming anyway. If Dad finds out, he'll kill me! How are you going to play without him noticing? I had an idea, but I need your help. Cíntia? Where were you, honey? Me? Walking around, admiring the party. It's very nice. It's horrid! The DJ still hasn't arrived! There must be music before Freddy gets here. Calm down. She must be a little late, that's all. She? The DJ is a woman? I'm not sure. That's what I heard. You heard that where? There's no need to explain. I found everything out. The DJ service that was hired belongs to her aunt's boyfriend. Oh, that irresponsible Rafael. - I'll call him. - Do that, honey. - [distant screaming] - It's Freddy! Freddy Prince is here! [Graziele] Freddy! Freddy! I am the birthday girl! - We are! - But I am more! And I'm Patrícia, their mother. - I'm your biggest fan! - We are! - But I am more! - Stop it! Sorry, but have we met before? I doubt it. I am too remarkable to be forgotten. Well, I was Miss Pool Piriri 2004. Maybe that's how you know me? I don't think so. I'm a very famous woman, always talked about and photographed. It could be from anywhere. Come to your dressing room. Where are you, auntie? - I need to play! - [distant scream] Auntie! Why didn't you use the door? I wasn't invited, damn it! Ouch, my back! You should have said my name. Who is going to believe I'm César's 17-year-old daughter? If you were 18, maybe-- - Let's go. Did you bring everything? - Yes, I have everything. And... done! Now... Look what I did with your sneakers. - So cute! - Go big or go home. [lively orchestral music plays] The main accessory. Do you think they'll recognize me? If no one recognized Superman in glasses, they won't recognize you in this gorgeous mask. [electronic pop music plays] César! César, the DJ has finally arrived. Great. I wasn't able to reach that stupid Rafael. - Out of the coverage area. - Speaking of stupid... Helena! Did you come with Cíntia, honey? So, what's new? The only new thing is you being friendly, sweetie.

Let me finish, please. - Who is playing? - No idea. - I'll go see. - Are you crazy? If you go out like that, they will attack you. Put the mask on so you won't be recognized. [remix of Freddy Prince song continues] [notes play when Cíntia touches the laser] What is she doing with Freddy's music? He will hate it. She's so clueless! Patrícia... Mom, look what that DJ is doing to my future husband's song! - My future husband! - Look in the mirror! Freddy will think it was my idea, and my life will be over! What's wrong with her? ♪ As my soul swells ♪ ♪ As my love... ♪ Your costume is very original. The other girls came as princesses, and you as the Queen of Hearts. Thanks! I like your sneakers. Dude, you should be down there, on the dance floor. I know. I only wanted to say I loved what you did with Freddy Prince's song. I had to fix that cheesy song. Cheesy? Don't you like Freddy Prince? I don't dig his mellow ballads. Mellow? ♪ I just have skin and sacred vows ♪ ♪ My heart has wings, they need to fly ♪ You are the first girl I've met who doesn't dig romantic ballads. I don't like anything that's not real. - And what is love? - An illusion. What? Love is an illusion that guys like Freddy Prince use to trick girls. Of course not! I even believe in love at first sight. Falling in love with someone just from seeing their face? Sometimes, you don't even need to look at the face. Sometimes, what the eye doesn't see, the heart feels. Isn't it the other way around? Not every time. [romantic guitar music plays] What do you think you're doing? Freddy Prince is here. What will he say when he sees you destroying his song? Destroying? The song is great. Who cares what you think? I am Freddy Prince. Wow! Only your opinion matters, right? The king of the ball. Freddy, it's nearly midnight, it's time for your set. I'm coming. What's your name? Cin... Cinderella. DJ Cinderella. [Freddy] Cinderella? Freddy, it's time! Come on! It's midnight. I have to go. [excited orchestral music plays] [crowd chants] Freddy, I love you! Freddy, I love you! [cheering and screaming] [Belinha] The moment you all have been waiting for! [both] It's Freddy! Welcome my, your, more mine than yours, Freddy Prince! Good evening. [music begins] ♪ When I find you again some day ♪ ♪ By chance, dangerously ♪ ♪ Fate will reveal itself ♪ ♪ Come with me ♪ I made a bet with your father that you wouldn't come. I also thought I wasn't coming. Parties with you and my father don't bring back good memories. Why? He's so much better with me. He has an attentive wife, daughters who respect him... Daughters? They love him as a father. And César also treats them as his own daughters. - As long as he pays for the parties. - What are you implying, insolent girl? - César! - [César] Hey. Honey, I'm very glad you came. I can't stay much longer, Dad. I have to get up early tomorrow. What about the concert? Don't you like that Freddy Prince? Of course she likes him. That's great. Honey, I'm taking this off. - Don't do it. You are so handsome! - It's too much. Excuse me. [song comes to an end] [Freddy] Thank you. [both] It's Freddy! I always ask a girl from the audience to dance with me. Today, I want to ask a different girl. I don't know her face or her name, but I know she has attitude... strong opinions and... rhythm. I call to the stage, DJ Cinderella! [gasping] What? Don't even dare to disguise yourself again and go up there. If you do, I'll tell your father the masked DJ was you. Will you risk ending your secret life as a DJ? A father like César can destroy your freedom, and without freedom no one is able to dream, honey. [Helena] Did you hear that, Cíntia? - Put the mask on! He's calling you! - Shut up. - What's going on? - Nothing, honey. The boy asked the DJ to the stage, but she has gone already, right, Helena? Huh? - Yes, she's gone. - Oh, really? Yes, and we are going as well. Honey... Wait, honey! - Let her go, dear. - We didn't even have time to talk. But look on the bright side. She and I are beginning to get along. She must have gone. Resume the concert. That's not possible. She must be back there. Just a minute, guys. [disappointed sighing] Just one moment, guys. Freddy Prince will be right back. [both] What the...? So, did you find your runaway princess? Only her shoe. [music plays through cell phone] ♪ When I find you again some day... ♪ Lara, turn that off, for God's sake. I need to concentrate. I need good grades to get my scholarship. - [music stops] - So grumpy! You should be happy. Didn't you say you crushed it at that party yesterday? Yes, I did. That's why I need to focus now. I'm only interested in being a DJ. This love crap only messes things up. What love crap? What are you talking about? Your love for André is what makes you lose your focus. No, André doesn't make me lose focus. André is my focus. And dating has never messed with anyone's life. Really? My aunt has wasted her time with boyfriends and-- And what? Girl, Chicken sang so beautifully today! You should have heard. Isn't that right, honey? Are you there, Dog? Bad Dog! You run away and then spend all night meowing. Cíntia, don't forget to feed the Fox, OK? Eat up, my little Fox. Kisses. Bye. See? Her boyfriends made her like that. Freddy Prince? Now I remember where I know you from. I played at this house about two years ago. Really? Yes, at a party that didn't end so well. It ended well for me. So much so that I live here now with César and my daughters. To what do I owe the honor of your visit? I wanted to know who the DJ was who opened for me yesterday. I really liked her. Come with me. [mischievous music plays] [Patrícia] Here. She was the DJ. My daughter Graziele. Oh... I met her when I arrived. She's pretty. But she was so different on stage. She was masked, right? Right. Sure. Sorry, I don't want to sound crazy, but... I felt something really rare for her. With all due respect. Aw, I know... Love is a really rare thing. Listen, you have her mother's blessing. You are such a famous guy... I mean, handsome and romantic. - The perfect match for Graziele. - She didn't strike me as romantic. She disguises it. Sometimes she is rebellious. We quarrel a lot. I'll tell you why. Her dream is to be a DJ. Her stepfather is against it. He doesn't allow it. But I support her. The mask was my idea. So that her father wouldn't notice. But she gets nervous, the poor girl. Well, can I see your daughter? Oh... She's not here. Poor thing... But let's arrange this meeting, OK? Not here, because of her stepfather. Where then? When? Whoa, calm down, mister. Leave it to me. I'll find a way. I'm great at it. Let's stay here for a little while longer! Let's go. Why would I want to watch these brats? André plays so well. [shouts] You are the best player! I see that. What's up, beautiful ladies? Enjoying the game? You have no idea. I have an invitation for tonight that you can't turn down. I scored tickets for the Midnight Club. Wow! Thank you for the invitation, André! Lara, I've told you a thousand times, I've moved on. But that doesn't mean we can't be together again one day. Lara... I would love to go. I love the resident DJ, but-- But she won't go alone. If the four of us go together, she is game, right? Pick us up at 7 p.m. It's a date. I'll be at your house at 7 p.m., Cíntia. Bye, beautiful ladies. [squeals] Thank you for saying yes, best friend! [Cíntia] Lara is completely clueless. I had no way out of it and now I'll have to go with a boy. On the other hand, the club is awesome, everybody goes there and the best DJs play there. Auntie? Aunt Helena? Anybody home? Are you OK? Rafa called and told me not to go meet him in Recife. This is so weird... He always wanted me to go. Maybe he is busy. I don't know... He was always crazy about me. What happened? [electronic pop music plays] [shouts] My dream is to play here! If I told you my father owns this club, what would you say? That you're lying. I know your father and the owner. I wanted to make your dream come true, even if it's only make believe. I'll pretend I didn't hear that, OK? [Freddy] Of course I'm excited, Bê. I'm going to meet my princess tonight. Calm down! There's a limit to being romantic. Don't overdo it. - You'll see. Just wait. - Right... I'll get a soda, OK? Do you want to dance, André? No, I'm good. I see. It's because I'm a bad dancer, right? No, I'm not in the mood. To dance? Let's talk then. I also like it better. I'm not in the mood to do anything. That's fine. I'll do nothing with you. You have such a beautiful smile, you know that? Lara, I'll tell you what. Get us a soda, and I'll be right back, OK? Hi. Two sodas, please. - Here you go. - Thanks. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'll get another one for you. Wait a minute, aren't you Belinha from the internet? I follow your channel! How exciting! A follower! What's your name? Lara. - Nice to meet you. - You too, Lara. Do you agree when I say that women from our generation should value themselves and have self-esteem? Of course. I totally agree. I think that you, as a public figure, need to open our eyes. That's good to know. Sorry, but I couldn't help listening to you talking to that boy. Oh, that's André. I love him. And, deep down, I know he loves me as well. Alright, but deep down do you love yourself? - I don't get it. - Yes, you do. But relax. It's just a tip. Do you want one or two sodas? Two, please. Two. Look who I brought to you. I'm sure you two were made for each other. Gisele, go take a walk. Go now. So it was you? I haven't been able to stop thinking about you since the party. Me neither. I'm your biggest fan. Don't you think my music is cheesy? Who would be stupid enough to think that? You. Besides me, of course. But I was just playing hard to get. I'm a huge fan. Do you have a map? A map? What for, dude? Because I'm lost in the twinkle in your eyes. Oh... So creative... [whispers] Not. - Tell me more about yourself. - What do you mean? The things you like... Oh, that's easy. I like you a lot! I'm your biggest fan! Did you know I'm setting up an organ donation campaign? Really? That's great! You surprised me. Do you want to donate your heart to me? Babe, what can I do? You're not a psychiatrist, but you've messed with my head. Oh, no! That does it. Excuse me. Are you sure it was you deejaying at the party? Of course. I am and will always be anyone you want! I am your biggest fan. Hi, how are you? - Do you have a map? - A map? Because I'm lost in the twinkle in your eyes. Wow, how original. I loved it. Give me just a minute. There's something wrong. - [Freddy] It's not her. - Mom, what's happening? What do I do? Go there and kiss him right now. Oh, no! Not again! André's soda! Where is he, by the way? Lara, let's get out of here. - Why did you do that? - Because I am you biggest fan. It's not possible that he didn't believe I'm not her! But you aren't, silly! - Yes, I am! You are jealous! - You're not! Shut up! Neither of you is somebody. Only I am! Honey, we'll find a way to make Freddy believe that you are his beloved DJ, OK? I still don't know how, but I'll find out. If I don't date Freddy, I'll die! Do you promise? [Graziele growls] Stop it. That boy will be yours, OK? And this is a promise. I think it must be her, Freddy. Think about it. It was her birthday, she wanted to pose as DJ without her parents noticing... So she wore a mask. It makes perfect sense. Was the kiss that bad? No, it's not that. It's just... I just wanted to be sure it's her, you know? How can I be sure? The same way the prince was sure it was Cinderella. ♪ Lost in distractions ♪ [music plays through headphones] ♪ Feeling the breeze ♪ ♪ Blowing a name I can't understand ♪ ♪ I imagine only you… ♪ Rafa, are you back from your trip? - How was it? - Smooth. But I'm... leaving. Like, for good. I came to say goodbye. What do you mean? Have you and aunt Helena...? Is it what I'm thinking? But I have good news for you. I got you a gig at the Midnight Club. You're kidding! My God, Rafa, I can't thank you enough! It will be a major plus on my resumé for the scholarship! It's to compensate for the mess I made with your father's party. That was bad, I'm sorry. I didn't even realize. - You know sometimes I'm a bit-- - Slow. I was going to say busy. But, OK, slow also fits. Take care of her. [cell phone ringing] Hello? [woman] Rafael? You don't know me, my name is Suelen. Smooth. No, not Smooth. Suelen. Anyway, I took my daughter to a party, and she loved the DJ. The owners of the house gave me your number. Smooth. It's not Smooth, honey, it's Suelen. Anyway... I would really like to know where that DJ is playing next. Cíntia? She rocks, right? She's playing from next week onwards at the Midnight Club. - But it's not for long. - Why? Because she's the best. She's going to study in London. And you'll have to go there to see her play, smooth? More than smooth, honey. That's silky, very interesting... London, really? Tell me more about that. [puppy whimpers] So cute! Rafa got tired. He always wanted a serious relationship and I never allowed it. Another woman wanted it, for sure. - Love also gets tired of waiting, Cíntia. - Don't be sad, auntie. - Did he give you this one? - Yes. Since I always name my pets after my exes, I'm going to name this one-- DJ. It's a great name to remember Rafa by. I have a better one for him: Love. [Freddy] Love. Those who know me or listen to my work know that love guides me. So I'm here, at Belinha's Channel, she's my childhood friend, to leave a message: DJ Cinderella, I couldn't even say goodbye. You really disappeared when the clock struck 12. I hope you had time to listen to my music and appreciate it as much as I appreciated yours. I have one of your crystal shoes, but I'll only deliver it in person. Bring the other one to complete the pair. At 2 p.m. on the 7th, at Rock Castle, where we met. Admit it. You are DJ Cinderella, aren't you? Be quiet! I want to scream because I'm angry! My best friend is dating Freddy Prince and I knew nothing about it! I'm not dating him. Are you nuts? He doesn't even know who I am. I saw him kissing another girl. That doesn't make sense. If he was with someone else, he wouldn't post that video. You can see it in his face. It's the same look André gives me in gym class. Really? If I was unsure, I'm not anymore. Listen, I don't want anyone to know about this, or... Or what, heart of stone? - Or I'll tell André you have gingivitis. - How gross! Cíntia? Can we have a word? It's about a talk I had with your father. Honey, it's hard to believe your father did that. Great, isn't it, Mom? They made an exception just for me. But I can't be with the other students. That's great, honey! About what you told me, I think it's great that you are chasing your dreams, truly. But you shouldn't hide from love. Mom, love only brings disillusion. Why would I risk it? Love is a risk, and at your age you should take risks, honey. My marriage to your father didn't work out, but I don't regret it. Our love brought me a lot of happiness. And you are the greatest of them all. [tense music plays] Are you crazy? Want to kill me? Stop exaggerating. I'm not a witch from a children's play. I come in peace. White flag. Can we talk? You don't need to treat me as your enemy. That's enough. You've done that for the last two years. - Don't I have my reasons? - As I have mine. But that's beside the point. The point is that I can help you, the same way I can accidentally tell your father about your gig at the club. How do you know about that? I have my ways. But if I know about it, does that change anything? No. But if your father finds out... And you will make sure he finds out, obviously. Not at all. He may end up agreeing to it. My father would never accept me being a DJ. Just like he would never leave your mother, and never let you live here. That's the power a woman has over a man in love. Get to the point, Patrícia. My family. That's what matters. I want peace, Cíntia. Even with you, honey. And I can get it. - But peace has its price, of course. - I knew it. I want the shoe you wore at the party. I get it now. You want Graziele to say that she was the DJ at the party. I've always found you unbearable, did you know that? But I never thought you were so smart. Unfortunately, Graziele isn't as smart as you. - That boy is her big chance. - Say what? And you must admit, he is not the right guy for you. - There's no way of knowing that. - Oh, but of course there is. What do you think a boy like him would do to your life? He would only be in the way of your goals. Because that's what love does, honey. It blinds you. You have your mother as an example, don't you agree? [melancholic guitar music plays] [Love whimpers quietly] [Love yelps] Here. Isn't this what you wanted? I knew you were smart. No need to hide anymore, Helena. I'm going. Go away, you vulture! Cíntia, did you really give the shoe to Patrícia? - She took the wrong shoe, auntie. - [Helena gasps] So you can play tonight without that voodoo blackmailing you, and tomorrow you have your chance with the boy! Great! What a brilliant idea! To tell you the truth, it wasn't my idea. Whose idea was it? It was Love's. My cutie pie! Come here. [electronic pop music plays] That DJ is underaged! - I am her father. - [disappointed yelling] And I demand she stops playing immediately! Dad, don't do that, please! He already did, honey. Let's go. [crowd booing] ♪ So close, too far ♪ ♪ Wherever you are... ♪ You're not working at night again, like a delinquent. This is the work of Helena and that stupid boyfriend of hers. Of course it is. That's why, from now on, you're going to live with us. You can't force me! I'll run away! Just try it. I'll report your aunt and that dumb Rafael for child exploitation. [César] Is that what you want? Is it? ♪ We could have been ♪ ♪ All of our dreams ♪ ♪ But maybe a dream is just a dream ♪ ♪ Please, don't try to reach me ♪ ♪ I have nothing to say ♪ ♪ But maybe it's better that way ♪ This is your new bedroom, Cíntia. It's plain like this because of renovations, but Patrícia will tidy it up. Of course. I'm very happy that you are back living with us. From now on, you'll have a father who is around. - When is your trip, honey? - Tomorrow morning. But I'll be back soon. I mean... Anyway... The linens are in the closet. Why did you do it? It wasn't to get you living here, you can be sure of that. A miscalculation. It happens. So why take Dad to the club? Because I couldn't risk Freddy finding you. You are very insolent. I knew you would be with him. Tomorrow, he will be convinced that Graziele was the masked DJ. I'll tell my father everything. He will believe me, wait and see. Let's bet on it. Let's bet on who has the most power. I'll bet, let's see, two reais. What do you say? Are you in? [Patrícia screams] [Cíntia] What are you doing? Stop it! [Patrícia screams] César! Stop screaming! Are you nuts? - What are you doing? - César! - [César] What's happening? What is this? - [Patrícia gasps] César! I only asked Cíntia if I could call her "daughter." I just wanted another daughter, and she attacked me. Dad, I didn't attack her! I didn't do anything! Enough! - Apologize to Patrícia. - Never! You have crossed the last line! You are grounded! You'll only leave to go to school. And that's until your graduation. [Gisele] You're ridiculous. [sinister music plays] [Patrícia] Psst. You owe me two reais. Attention! - [crowd screaming] - Calm down, people! Attention, Freddilets, Freddilovers, Freddegunds... Control yourselves. Freddy is in there watching my live feed, and when I identify the right shoe, I will take the princess to him, OK? Come! - It's a major commotion. - [crowd booing] [woman] Don't cut the line, lady. I have priority. If Prince is still unsure, here is the proof that my daughter was the DJ. - Come here. - Come, honey. Gorgeous people, this lady is the host of the party where Freddy met the masked DJ. If anyone knows her identity, it's this woman. - So, I'm sorry, but she has priority. - [angry yelling] But we've been waiting for hours! Let's go. - Just a minute. - [crowd booing] The moment of truth has arrived. After you doubted that my daughter was telling the truth, I thought hard about whether she should be subjected to this. But her love moved me, and I thought you deserved a second chance. Here it is. It's time, people. - You're joking, right? - What do you mean? - This is the shoe. - It's not. Of course it is. I organized the party, I know. It's a trick. Tell him, Graziele. Freddy, I am your biggest fan! OK, maybe I mixed them up. She has so many shoes, you have no idea. And what's up with this obsession with shoes? For God's sake... Graziele is a wonderful girl. She sings like a nightingale. Sing for him, honey. [singing out of tune] ♪ When I find you again some day ♪ ♪ By chance, infinitely ♪ Oh, my God... ♪ Fate will reveal itself ♪ ♪ Come with me ♪ ♪ I'll say good morning ♪ That's fine, that's fine! Thank you. OK? - Sorry, Freddy, but-- - I know. You are my biggest fan. I got that. I always wrote about love, and... As much as I disapprove of what you did, now that I know what it is to be in love, I understand you better. Aw! So cute! Let go, Graziele. Let go. Come here. And I'm sorry, but I need to find my princess. Freddy, you will regret this. - Wow... - [Graziele] Let it go, Mom. It's over. It's over for you. For me, it has just started. Isn't revenge a dish best served cold? So be it. That was exciting, people! What do you say, Freddy? She didn't show up. [sad pop music plays] Oh, my God! [André] That's enough, Lara. Let me go. Hey, bestie, listen to this. André is taking me to the prom. You know what this means? That he ran out of options? No, that he loves me. I've always known. Good for you, then. Hey, girl, cheer up! I saw on Belinha's Channel that Freddy is going on tour and will be away for a long time. Is that supposed to cheer me up? No! Before that, he is playing one last gig at our prom, which means you still have a chance, silly. Is this for real? Totally for real. But I think you shouldn't wait for the party. Go to him and put an end to this mess. Did you forget I'm grounded? I only leave school to go home. They even took away my phone. At least I saw Patrícia embarrassing herself with the wrong shoe. And do you think she's going to go easy on you after that? Be prepared for the worse. What else she can do to me? - [school bell rings] - [telephone rings] Hello? Hi, honey. How are you? Really? That's right. César decided to donate more computers to the school. I also loved the idea. When can I send the IT guy to install the software? - [IT guy] I'm almost done. - [principal] That's great. [principal] Will you excuse me for a moment? - Sure. - Thank you. [mischievous music plays] Hello, Mrs. Patrícia? It's all done. You now have access to the school platform. Well done. [music intensifies] You scared me, child! - What do you want? - Nothing. I just came to tell you that Daddy is home. OK. Go. I really wanted to go to the prom. [César] Isn't it only for graduating students? And their families. We could accompany Cíntia. I'm grounded, remember? [Patrícia] César! Hi, honey. Cíntia has been behaving so well. It's her graduation. She has to go. I don't have any clothes. I left most of them at aunt Helena's. Of course you're going. It's your graduation. I don't want you near your aunt's house, but we can call a store here. Of course. I can call and they'll bring different options. [César] I can't believe that my little girl is graduating. Do you know what you want to study? Thank you. Dad, I am one of the school's best students. With my grades, I intend to try for a scholarship to study in London. Really? And what do you want to major in? Music production. I want to be a DJ, Dad. Oh, honey... a DJ? Dad, being a DJ doesn't mean I'll only be playing at night. I'll also be producing content, producing music... And do you think you'll make a living out of it? [Cíntia] Why not? A lot of people do. This is my passion. We'll talk about it after your graduation. OK? - I really like it, Dad. - It's very pretty. [Patrícia] Very pretty indeed. Maybe a bit plain, but a black dress is always a good choice. It's a little creased. I can ask someone to iron it for you. No, I'll iron it myself. Really, one of the best students? I'm so glad! At least we have some good news. But this is great news, César. Let's check her grades on the school's website. Later. I also want to be proud of my stepdaughter. [mischievous music plays] [footsteps] [Patrícia whispers] Gisele, come here. Come here! Go get your stepsister. César wants to talk to her. Cíntia, Dad is calling you. [ominous music plays] - Did you send for me, Dad? - No, honey. [Patrícia] Yes, you did, César. To check her grades on the school's website, remember? - The report card is not there yet. - I think it is. I'm dying to see the twins' as well. I'm worried about Gisele, honey. Here it is. Check it out. What's this, Cíntia? You failed two classes? Are you joking, Dad? I know my grades are great. Great? F in Geography. F in History. I don't know what you think great is-- - That doesn't make sense! - Actually, it does. It must be hard to study by day and work by night. This is not right! - Stop telling lies, Cíntia! - But-- It's already disappointing enough to find this out on graduation day! - Dad, I'm not a liar! - Oh, no? Really? Calm down. She was probably waiting to tell you after the party. - No! - That's exactly it! Everything is a party to you! You are a spoiled girl. This princess life has to end. [Gisele] Fire! My dress! - [shouts] You crazy witch! - What do I have to do with this? See how she treats me, César? Honey, what's this? Are you crazy? Patrícia hasn't left our side! You must have left the iron on. [shouts] You are a snake and a liar! I'm going to kill you! Stop that! What's wrong? Come with me. Dad, you need to believe me, please! I barely know you these days. You really don't know me. - You are grounded. - What? And now I have to go to that party, or it would be unfair to the girls. And we will have a serious talk later. [frustrated cry] You ruined Graziele's dream mercilessly. Would it hurt to be more generous? You gave me the wrong shoe and thought you'd get away with it. Time to pay for that, dear. [electronic pop music plays] [cell phone rings] Pick up, André. [cell phone rings] [cell phone rings] [cell phone ringing] - [telephone rings] - [Patrícia] Oh, well. [César] Answer that phone. [telephone ringing] - Hello? - Cíntia? I need to talk to Cíntia. Get yourself together, girl. Don't call people's homes like this. Please, I need to talk to my friend. Cíntia is grounded indefinitely. You'd better find another friend, ok? Bye. [Patrícia] Trying to sell things at this hour, can you believe it? - Did you buy anything? - Of course not. [romantic guitar music plays] ♪ Lost in distractions ♪ ♪ Feeling the breeze ♪ ♪ Blowing a name ♪ ♪ I can't understand ♪ I'll miss you so much when you're on tour. I'm glad I'm going on tour. But I can't stop thinking about DJ Cinderella. It's hard. Freddy, seriously... I think you have to face facts. If she still hasn't shown up, it's because... [mischievous music plays] [loud crash] [Helena groans] [Helena] Cíntia? Cíntia! Cíntia! [Cíntia] Auntie? - [Cíntia] The door is locked! - Here, behind you. Cíntia, come here, girl. Help me, DJ! [Helena] OK. Done. I came to rescue you. Your friend called me. You have to go to that prom, no matter what. - But how? I don't even have a dress. - Auntie godmother came prepared, honey. - One dress coming up! - This dress? It's this one or this one. Last time I wore it was two years ago, at my parents' anniversary. - Do you know what that means? - That it's a little musty? But it doesn't smell bad. No. It means I was a silly girl who believed in love. After all I went through, do you think I can dress like a princess to chase a boy? You can do whatever you want. The question is what do you want? [electronic pop music plays] ♪ Come for life ♪ ♪ For me... ♪ [Lara] Bestie! - You look so pretty! - Thank you. Did you bring the mask? Yes, I brought the mask, the shoe... Everything that has kept these two apart. The security is very tight. No one gets near the dressing room. What if I get to play? Maybe he'll listen. Great idea! Yes, at least you still have hope. Oh, Lara. Are you OK? I hate that Camila Abranches. She ruined my chances with André. But why hate her? André was the one who invited you. No hating today! We're here to dance, to have a good time, and, in our case, Lara, to forget men exist. Wait a second. Is that Rafa? With another woman? - I'm going after her. - Go. - Stop this nonsense right now! - Helena? Listen, you deceptive prick, I never needed a man in my life, until you showed up with a puppy called Love and left me confused. - What? - Were my ways wrong? Yes. But it was my way of loving you. You should have found a way around it, not swapped me for another woman, because I'm not changing, no way! Hey, honey, pay attention to see if you get it. Got it? Or do I need to show you with the sole of this shoe? - [Rafa] Helena... - Slut! - Helena! - Get out of here! He's mine! Go! Helena, smooth! I don't have another girlfriend. Oh, no? And who is she? I have no idea. Poor lady. Lady, I'm sorry! Rafa, I love you. Come back to me. What else can I do? I love you too, my cuddly one. I'm so glad you worked it out! Cíntia! I like your mask. Take your stand as DJ Cinderella and lure your prince in. What do you mean? I'll explain later. Come. Let her play. A boarding school would be great for Cíntia. It's the only way to protect her from the bad influences of her aunt and Rafael. - [César] I'm not sure. - [Gisele] Hi. Let me introduce Diego. - How are you, Diego? - Fine. [César] Excuse me. - Is it me, or are you two-- - We are getting to know each other. - Is he rich, famous, important...? - He's a normal boy. What else could I expect from you? A plain girl and a plain boy. What can I do? - Mom! - The truth hurts but makes you stronger. Let's go, Diego.

I believed that some day I would find someone who really cared about me, despite my fame or my name. Then... when I finally found what I was looking for, you didn't feel the same way. That's not it.

I found out who your princess is. - Unfortunately, she's not into me. - Why are men so stupid? Listen to this. Cíntia! Wait up, girl! You can't leave now. I have nothing else to do here. If my father sees me, he'll turn my life into hell. No, you're not leaving. I know I usually leave this bit until the end of the set, but the girl I want to dance with tonight has a strange habit of vanishing. My heart is going to burst! [Freddy] I didn't know her name until today. I had also never seen her face, or... at least, I thought I hadn't, because I realized that... it's the same face I have been dreaming about for years. - You have to go up there. - My father can't see me. I can't! [Freddy] And all I ask now... is that you do me the honor of dancing with me, Cíntia Dorella. Too late. [uplifting music plays] She's not dancing. She's not dancing! I am Cíntia's guardian, and she didn't have permission to be here. Take your hands off Cíntia! Mom! I don't believe it. Honey, I asked your aunt not to tell you because I wanted to surprise you at your graduation. She's my daughter. I'll allow it. Ana dear, I'm sorry to spoil the moment, but Cíntia didn't graduate. César grounded her because she failed two classes, right, honey? That's impossible. Cíntia is the top student. - What do you mean, César? - Unfortunately, it's true. Mom, admit it. You changed Cíntia's grades. I saw you accessing the school platform. - What is she saying, Patrícia? - That girl is crazy. Have you lost your mind? You know, Mommy, the truth hurts but makes you stronger. Ladies and gentlemen, Cíntia has more than sufficient grades to graduate. So let's get on with the party, and we'll get to the bottom of this later. - Honey, I can explain. - [César] Let's go. [César] Let's go. Get up there. Go. So it was you?

[Cíntia] Graziele, on the other hand, didn't change one bit. You want to go on a date with me? Graziele, you've never taken any notice of me. That was before you became a famous YouTuber. Now, I am your biggest fan. Really? Girls, does any of you want to go on a date with me tonight? See that? It's too late now. I've moved on. That's my line. What do you want? A chance. What do I need to do to get your attention, Graziele? You need to succeed. So go away! [Cíntia] Aunt Helena and Rafa are extremely happy, and Love the dog had puppies. Remember to bathe Love and don't forget the puppies' medicine. Smooth, my cuddly one. [Cíntia] As for Patrícia? She left her daughters with my father and returned to her home in Piriri. Hi, Mom. Look, everything is squeaky clean. What do you want? Talking like that... Am I saying, "Raise my allowance, don't be so cheap, I deserve more money...?" Am I? Don't even try because I won't raise it by a single cent! And go fix that bathroom. The toilet has clogged again. It flooded and it needs cleaning up. Go on. Don't be squeamish like that. Do a good job because I'm going to inspect it, got it? If she's happy, that's another story. I know we are. It's obvious you're in love by the look on your faces. Did you like London? Man, it was great. That's where we started playing together and... The rest is history. The romantic pop and the electronic beat work very well together. [Lara] And... cut!
