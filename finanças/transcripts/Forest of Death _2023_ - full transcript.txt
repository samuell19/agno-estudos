[water dripping] [suspenseful music] [water dripping] [suspenseful music] Brad, someone's in the house. Stay here, okay? Who the hell is in here, all right? [pants] Stay here. -What the fuck? -[ominous music] [grunts] [door creaks] Brad. [exhales] I killed it. Whatever the fuck it is. [ominous music] [snarls] [cell phone ringing] -Yo. -Yo, where you at? We're leaving in an hour. I've been calling you all morning. Yeah. Look, I was going to talk to you about that. I'm not sure if I want to go. Come on. You better not be bailing now. I already paid for the cabin. Look, man, I just don't want to go as the third wheel. You're not. I promise you. We already talked about this. She's bringing a friend. She single? [chuckles] Yeah, and she's hot. Listen, if you come, I promise you'll be getting laid. I am not sleeping with him. You better make that 100% clear. He's not going to make a move, okay? Trust me, he's not that kind of guy. Whoa. You said the same thing about Chad, and we both know how that turned out. Well, that was different, okay? I know Dylan, and he's harmless. Plus, Tom says he's going to chip in on the rental. I don't know. It just kind of feels like you're bringing me along to help pay for the rental. Why would I do that? Come on. So, you coming or what? So, you want to come or what? Yeah, I'm down. Yeah, I'm in. [ominous music] [ominous music continues] [music fades out] -[Tom] I think this is it. -[Ashley] This it? -[Ashley] Nice. -[Tracy] Uh, not bad. Woo-hoo, look at this place. Wow. Yeah, this place is dope. -Huh. Not bad. -This is going to be pretty fun, guys. Are you sure this place has service? -No. -[laughs] [suspenseful music] -All right, come on, hand 'em over. -You don't trust me? No. You're easily the least trustworthy person here. -Really? -[chuckles] Yes. [glasses clink] Who wants another round? To a great weekend. [glasses clink] [zipper opening] So, you know, I was thinking... Oh, God, here we go. Let's let Dylan and Tracy have a little alone time, and then me and you, let's head down to the springs. Clothing optional. In your dreams, yeah. Do you want this one? I could take the one by the door. -Yeah, if you don't mind. -Not at all. God damn it! Did you find it? There's only two rooms here. Oh. Well, if you want my room-- Oh, no, I'll sleep on the couch. -Are you sure? -Yeah, I prefer it anyway. [grunts] [suspenseful music] [Tom] All right, guys, I don't know about you, but I've been waiting -a long time for this weekend. -[Ashley] Yeah. What do you guys want to do? We could have some food. We could do some drinking games. Or we could go on a hike. Just finish rolling this up. -Yes. -Yeah, I'm down. We've been in a car all day. Let's get some fresh air. -Yeah, hiking it is. -Agreed.

Oh, I'm sorry about that! You're the renters, ain't you? Oh, boy. I almost killed you. I-- You were almost going to die. [stutters] Your, your brains were going to go boom. Oh, man. Ooh. What a mistake. My name is Roger. My uncle owns that there cabin. Hey, you can put your hands down, bud. I'm not going to kill you. I almost killed you. I almost murdered you, right here, cold blood. Come on, I'll help you get found. Oh, boy. What a story is that gonna be. I made some city boy piss his pants. [exclaims] Come on. [twigs snapping] Finally. What took you so long? I thought we had lost you. Yeah, guys, this is, this is Roger. He's the nephew of the guy that owns the cabin. Hi, ladies. How y'all doing? Okay, do you know how to get back to the cabin? I sure do. I know every part of these woods. And I got to tell you right now, where you are, it's not a place for pretty ladies like yourself. Come on, let's get you back. -[quietly] Okay. -[Roger] Come on! Giddy up, little boy. [rattling] [Roger] Watch out, spider. Snake. Finally. [chuckles] Well, that was quite an adventure. See, I told you I'll find our way back. Hey, guys, come on over. This is my uncle. Joe. He's the one renting y'all this cabin. Come say hi. Mm. Sorry about earlier. I got a little bit tied up. Uh, did you all get settled in okay? Yeah. I think we got everything we need. -Thanks. -Yeah. Good, good. And sorry about my nephew. Um, someone's been killing our livestock. So, we're, we're a bit on edge right now. But if y'all need anything, just remember, I'm only a phone call away. Mm, you live nearby? Yeah, about, about 30 minutes out. Um, but if anything goes wrong, definitely call me first because the cops are about an hour away, and there's only one sheriff on location. -Okay. Thanks, Joe. -Hmm. All right. Just remember, a phone call away. Hey, you got any of that hard stuff? -Wha-- what stuff? -Yeah, you know, the moonshine. Oh, yeah, 'cause all us country boys know how to make moonshine. Well, you're right, we do. Is there anything else you want too? What are you looking for? What does $20 get me? Mm. Well, $20 won't get you as much as $50. But we'll see. All right, bring it back tonight? Sure thing. Come on, Roger. Let the people be. [Roger] I can't believe that dumb son of a bitch gave me 20 bucks for piss water. [fizzes] Was I the only one creeped out by Joe and his nephew? Yeah, they were, like, too nice or something. Uh, that was just their Southern charm. You guys just need to relax. I mean, they were just trying to get the five-star. We were their first renters. It was a bit weird that he told us to call him instead of the emergency lines. He did say that they were closer, but, yeah, it was a bit weird. [scoffs] Listen, you guys need to relax and have a great time. We got everything we need right here.

'Cause Ashley told me that she does. -Really? -I'd make a move soon because otherwise you're just gonna end up regretting it. I don't know. I just don't want to make things weird, especially this early in the trip. [Tom] Are you serious? I can get it. Just give me a second. Listen, I'm gonna go find some paper. [suspenseful music] Fuck. I hope it gets to light. He will. He's smart. You like him, don't you? [chuckles] Stop... All right. Come on. [exclaims] Oh. Oh, perfect. You know, if he blows himself up, you're taking him to the hospital. Relax, he'll be fine. [rattling] -[Tom] Hey, Dylan. -What? [Tom] Come look what I found.

[muted voice] [muted voice] [muted voice] [suspenseful music] [muted voice] [Tracy] Hey, thanks for bringing me out here again. See, I told you you'd have fun. We ought to get you out more. I just didn't want to be the third wheel again. -I wouldn't do that to you. -Of course you wouldn't. At least not on purpose. [chuckles] You know, this might be a couples weekend. Cut that out. You got to give him a chance. You never know. All right, who wants another round? [suspenseful music] [sighs] [Tom] Oh, come on, Dylan. Left the damn door open. [sighs] [exhales] [suspenseful music] Jackpot. [ominous music] What the hell are you doing here? I had to take a piss. You can't just use our rental like that. Oh, relax. Don't get your man panties in a bunch. I brought you a gift. Here's your hard stuff. [clicks tongue] Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm collecting my delivery fee. [grunts] Oh, boy. All you got are these shitty Seltzers, huh? Get out of here. -Get-- -You are an ungrateful motherfucker. [Tom] Come on. [Roger] I can't wait to fuck your girlfriend. Look who I found in our cabin. Hi, ladies. Ooh, that's a fire pit. Mm. Mm-hmm. [Dylan] Uh, this is, this is kind of a private party. I see that. Thank you for inviting me to your privates. Pleased to be here. Little ladies, how y'all doing tonight? You look lovely as ever. Ooh, there's a lot of blank faces here. Oh, shit, am I the problem? Yes, I am the problem. I'm the-- I'm sorry if I'm making y'all uncomfortable. No. Um... That's not it. All right, I get it. I get it. You all are scared to hang out with a country boy. You're afraid I might be dangerous, right? That's fine. That's fine. Worst thing I'm going to do is bite. But you know what? I see my place. I'm going to get myself up. I'm gonna get out here. Besides, my uncle would not want me being out here this late, this close to these woods. -So have a good night. -[Tracy] Why? What's wrong with the woods? Well, you see... ...there's evil in these woods. He's just drunk, guys. Don't, don't listen to him. Do you see anybody else out here? It's just y'all. I'm not planning on staying, and there's a reason for that. The reason is locals know enough not to come out to these woods at night. I mean, we were just out there, and it was dark. We didn't say anything. Well, uh... Well, you see, you all were out there together, right? Y'all were in a group. See, what it wants to do is it wants to break you apart. It wants to separate you. So as long as y'all in a group, y'all might be okay. You might be okay. But the moment it gets in one of your heads and it separates you, that's when it strikes like a coiled-up snake and just snaps right at you. It? What are you talking about, "it"? [exclaims] Well, it... [clicks tongue] Some people call it the devil. Some people call it a wendigo. Hell, some people call it a chupacabra. You believe that shit? Not me. I know what it is. It's a shape-shifter. It'll take your form. It'll take your voice, it mimics you. [muffled laughter] You really think that we're going to believe this shit? There is an evil in these woods. There is something out there. Y'all safe right in here, but just wait... ...because when it takes one of your forms or it takes one of your voices, and suddenly, you're being called out there by a damsel in distress and you go running... ...it can look like anyone you know. Hell, it could look like you, blondie. All pretty and perfect. Or hell, it can look just like you, just running around, having the time of his life. Have you ever seen it? [clears throat] Y'all ask a lot of questions. Sounds to me like y'all want to hear a story. You'll want to hear a story? I got one for you. You girls are gonna love this. It's a romance story. [clicks tongue] See, I met a girl one time. She was as beautiful as the day is long. Diamond eyes. Perfect hair. Perfect skin, perfect smile, and these great big breasts. And, boy, I fell in love. And she saw me and she fell in love. We were married, and happily ever after. One day, I'm out here... ...these woods right over there. And I don't know, I just lost track of time. Delirious, I guess. As that sun started going down, I started hearing things, voices and songs calling me in. As soon as that sun went all the way down, I really started hearing things, and there right in front of me... ...there was my wife. Well, hey... [chuckles] So you saw your wife, that was it? What's so scary about that? Problem with that was... ...my wife had died six years earlier. But there she was, right in front of me. Okay, but we're outside right now. Why hasn't it killed us yet? You see the reason's not here.... ...even though I'll be honest with you... ...it is listening... ...it is watching, but it's not coming over here... ...'cause of this fire pit right here. You see, that shape-shifter doesn't seem to like fire. Something about this flame. This color and this light. Maybe it's this warmth. Whatever it is... ...keeps that away. But as soon as this goes out, as soon as it gets in one of y'all heads... -...makes y'all-- -Enough! All right. We've had enough. Now we're not going to be able to sleep tonight. Thank you very much. I'm sorry if you can't sleep tonight, but I'm more than happy to make it up to either one of you. I got a nice warm bed, enough to fit two pretty girls on it. So if you need help sleeping, you'll just find Roger. Good luck with your fire. Hope it stays lit. [suspenseful music] Well, that was weird. Yeah, something is definitely off with that guy. You guys really believe that shit? I mean, it could be possible. These woods are massive. There could be something out there. [chuckles] Yeah, but something called the winnebago. Come on. He's just messing with you guys. You just need to let it go. Let me go find some firewood. Maybe next time we should try and get our rental away from the forest full of creatures trying to kill us. Well, I'll remember that for next time. [Tom] God damn, redneck. [rattling] Scared my girlfriend like that. [Ashley] Tom? -Ashley? -Come here. -Why? -You know why. Let's go to the springs. -But I thought-- -Come on, don't be such a pussy. -Let me get this wood back in the fire. -Tom, come on. I'll be right back. What the-- Hey, what's wrong? You look like you just saw a ghost. -You, you were just out there. -Who? You... You told me to join you and... We've been here the whole time. No, no, no. I heard your voice. You were out in the woods. Why would we go out to the woods if Roger just... I, I don't know, but I heard your voice. I'm going to take him inside. Come on, let's get you to bed. You wanna get laid or not? You think he's okay? Yeah, he's fine. Just drank too much. I don't know. He seemed really confused. Trust me, this isn't the first time it's happened. Yeah, and with Ashley's new promotion, he must be feeling the pressure to keep up. Yeah. I mean, he's a good guy. He's just struggling that's all. Real world's not like frat life. I'm sure he'll figure it out. I, I guess I'm going to go check on them and see if everything's okay. Yeah, all right. You head in. I'll take care of the fire. [fire crackling] [exhales] Hello? [suspenseful music] [fizzling out] Hey, I think I'm going to head to bed. I have had enough to drink for one night. You're telling me you don't want to get more shots of rum? [chuckles] We still have three days left here. I'm trying to pace myself. [mellow music] Goodnight, Dylan. Today was really fun. I'm glad you came. Good night. [Ashley moaning] [Ashley] Oh, keep going. Oh, fuck! [laughs] -[continues moaning] -This is fucking unreal. -[Ashley] Yeah! -[exclaims] [dramatic music] [exclaims] [clicks tongue] This guy is fucking unbelievable. [Ashley moaning] God damn it. [grunts] [dramatic music] [matchstick crackling] [suspenseful music] [Tracy] Dylan. [teasingly] Dylan. Tracy? It's me, come on. [ominous music] What are you doing up? [Tracy] I just want to show you something. Tracy? Kind of freaking me out. -[snarls] -Dylan? Hey, wake up. You're going to miss breakfast. What time is it? It's time to roll another blunt. I saved some for you. Thanks. You better eat up. We've got a long day ahead of us.

Well, you could make more money that way. It's true, but I'm looking for something more relaxed, you know, like headshots. Oh. Well, just let me know when you open for business, and I will be your first customer. -Oh. -I need to change up my Tinder profile pics. It could be a little tricky, you know. There's not a whole lot to work with you. That is no way to treat a paying customer. Oh, you're paying me now. In that case, you look great. Yeah. I think one of these could work. Only one? [chuckles] [suspenseful music] They uploaded yet? -Can I see 'em? -Yeah. Give me just a second. I'm trying to color-correct them. Oh, shit. These are actually really good. Thanks. Hey, forget Tinder. Why don't you help me take some pics from my articles? We pay pretty good. I would love that. What the hell? What? What's wrong? There's, there's something in the photo It could be an artifact or something. My camera and lens aren't the best. No. No, it's a person. Look, right there. Can you, can you zoom in? I saw that guy. -When? -Yesterday, when we got lost. I tried to ask him for help, but he just kept walking. Is he stalking us? I don't know. It is creepy, though. Can you open another? Wait, what the fuck? Wait, that's Roger. Yeah, and he's in some of the other photos too. So was the other guy. Are they both watching us? What the hell? I don't know. I mean, it's their woods. So maybe they were just hunting. But if they were hunting, they'd have guns. Yeah, I knew something was wrong with that guy. How long were they following us? Can you check some of the other photos, Dylan? All right, let's call Joe. I mean, may, maybe we can just get a refund. I mean, if it happens again. If it happens again, we call the police. [suspenseful music] [Tracy] You really saw that guy out there when we were hiking? Yeah. He didn't say anything? No, he just kept moving. Couldn't catch up to him. I think they're just trying to scare us. Yeah. But I don't think they mean any harm. Yeah, well, let's not worry about this now, anyway. Let's go play some cards.

I don't know if maybe you're new to the property management thing, but this is really making everyone super uncomfortable. Now, now, hang on. I can fix this if you can just explain. What I'm trying to say is that your nephew has been lurking outside all day, and he needs to leave us alone. I see what you're saying, but it just doesn't make any sense. What do you mean, it doesn't make any sense? I feel like I'm being pretty clear here. I'm telling you, he's been here with me all day. He's here with me right now. No, we have him on camera. I said we saw him. I'm telling you, he's been here all day with me watching the ball games. Okay, then put him on the phone. [exclaims] Renters want to talk to you. What the fuck they want to talk to me for? [clears throat, grunts] -This is Roger. -It's you. Oh, it's you. Good to hear your voice again. I was starting to get a little bit lonely. You're looking for a good time, girl? Um, could you put Joe back on the phone please? All right. She's not looking for a good time. She wants to talk to you. You see, must've been someone else. He's been here with me all day watching the ball game. Uh, yeah, it must have just been someone else, I guess. Uh, do you want me to come over? Um, we take trespassing real serious. And it could be the same people killing my livestock. No, um, I'm fine. I got it. All right, all right. Well, keep in mind I'm only a phone call away, all right? Sorry, Joe. Thank you. [suspenseful music] You guys saw him out there in the woods. -Right? -There was definitely something out there. I mean, we heard him. Just, it was kind of hard to tell. You think Joe would lie? No, it was Roger on the other end. I don't even think he would have made it back in time. If you want to leave, we could head back tonight. I think we stay the night. I mean, whoever it is that I scared, it's gone now. Yeah, Tom definitely scared him off. What's one more night? We'll leave in the morning. It's up to you. But if you're okay with it, I would like to stay. Yeah, guys, I don't even think we need to worry about anything. We can stay. [suspenseful music] [grunts] [chuckles softly] Well, this is not what I had in mind for tonight. Sure you're all right? We can leave if you like. No, Dylan and Tracy are hitting it off. I really don't want to ruin it for them. But are you sure you scared him off? Yep. If they decide to come back, I'll take care of it. You're telling me. But at least we're not leaving. Mm. Yeah, I'm not ready to leave yet or at all. So you think Ashley is going to want to leave in the morning? I don't know. I'm more worried about Tom. If, Roger, whoever comes back, he's gonna want to fight him. And I've been there before. Trust me, we don't want that. So it sounds like you've known Tom and Ashley for a while. Yeah, we were best friends growing up. I've known them forever too. So it's really lame we never got to meet until now. Yeah, I've been having fun, but I hope we don't leave in the morning. Well, you know, if we do have to leave, then you can always hang out. -Yeah. -Without those two Okay, I'm going to get ready for bed. -[gaps] -What? [ominous music] That mother-- Yeah, I'd like that. [Tom] He's back! -The fuck are you doing? -I saw Roger. I'm going to beat his ass. Wait, you saw him again? Outside my window. God damn it! [pants] Tom, come on, get back inside. Come out, Roger, fight like a man. He's not worth it. We need to help them. Yeah. I'm on it. Tom? [Tom] Where are you? [suspenseful music] Tom, where are you, man? [twigs snapping] Tom? [ominous music] I think I scared him off. Great. Good work, Tom. -Wait. Where's Ashley? -She followed me. Yeah, she was right behind you. Great. [ominous music] I'm right here. I was looking for you. Where are you? Are you okay? I'm fine. I was right behind you. Let's go inside. Wait. Ashley... ...you all right? I'm tired. I'm going to bed. I'm, uh, gonna go with her. [mellow music] Something is definitely wrong with Ashley. What do you mean? I don't know, but I'm going to find out. Ashley? Are you sure you're okay? Yes. Why wouldn't I be? We can leave tonight. I mean, this is a lot. It's all okay. We're safe here. Mm. Are you sure? I mean, what about Tom? I'll take care of Tom. Good night, Tracy. -Wait-- -[door closes] [suspenseful music] What are you looking at? -Just something that's been bothering me. -What? All right, so you know how me and Tom were out in the woods, and we heard all those voices. Uh, yeah. Well, I'm starting to think what Roger was talking about was real. You know, the shape-shifter? No, no, that's not possible. That, that sounds crazy. I mean, he was drunk. He was trying to mess with us. Yeah, maybe. But everything he was saying, fire, mimicking voices, changing forms, it's all right here. I actually started thinking about it yesterday. You know, when we were lost in the woods, I saw that guy and he didn't stop. He just kept walking. What does that have to do with anything? Well, that guy is this guy. No. That's not possible. It couldn't be him because-- Because he's dead. Yeah, I know. He died right here in this cabin. It couldn't have been the same guy. It had to be someone else. Oh, that's what I thought at first, but then, look... [suspenseful music] On our pictures from yesterday. He's right here, the same guy. We need to get out of here right now. What you doing? You okay? Come on, let's have some fun. What do you wanna do? Let's go to the springs. Outside? -We can go skinny dipping. -[chuckles] It's a little late for that. Come on. [exhales] What if Roger's out there? You scared him off. He won't be back. -Trust me. -All right. [Tracy panting] [suspenseful music] [zipper closing] [zipper closing] All right, I think that's everything. Give me your stuff, and I'll load it in the car. Wait, Ashley has the car keys. Fuck! [knock on door] [Dylan] Hello? We gotta talk. [knock on door] All right. I'm coming in. They're not here. Where the fuck are they? What the hell? Wait, they didn't leave us here. Did they? [ominous music] [panting] The car's, car's still here. We need to find them. Call her number. [cell phone ringing] Wait. Fuck, Ashley never leaves her phone. [cell phone continues ringing] Okay, let's just call Joe. He can help us find them, and then we can get the hell out of here. [knock on door] Is that them? Wait. Hold on. I could be the... No one's out there. Are you sure? [Tracy] Tom? Ashley? [gasps] Hurry, it's coming. Let me in now. I think it's outside, no! Let me in! Tom. -We don't know if that's him. -I mean, he's hurt. We have to do something. -It could be that creature. We have to be sure before-- -Or it could be Tom. I'm not letting him bleed out on the porch. Come on. Please, hurry, Hurry! There's something out here. Stop messing around. What the fuck? Ashley's gone crazy. Please. She's trying to kill me. Please let me in. Hurry, hurry, let me in. I think it's Ashley. I don't know. Hurry, just let me in. [knocking continues] -You're Tom? -Yes. Come on. Stop messing around. Just please, just let me in. -You're Tom? -Yes. There's something out here. Please. [panting] Open the front door. That one's Tom. Jesus Christ, dude. What the fuck happened? [groans] I was-- Ashley attacked-- All right, man. It's all right. Just calm down. No, it's not. Tom, where is Ashley? What did you do to her? [mumbles] I don't know. I don't know. She-- It wasn't her. It wasn't her. Wait, who attacked you? What happened? Ashley-- I don't-- Where is the real Ashley? There's something out there. Okay, Tom, where the fuck is Ashley? -What happened to my friend? -I don't know. I don't know. All right, man, just slow down and tell us exactly what happened. [panting] All right. I was in the woods. Why? It's fucking midnight. We were supposed to go to the springs, but then, but then I was attacked, and then I-- [sighs] I don't know. It wasn't her, though. It wasn't her. It wasn't her. There's something out there. Something out there. It was the creature, the one Roger was talking about. I'll call for help. [phone ringing] Rockwood Sheriff's Office, what's your emergency? Hey, we need help. One of my friends is hurt and the other friend is missing. We need you to send multiple units now. I'm not messing around. Where are you located, son? The, the Lockwood Woods, off route one, by the old cabin. Now, calm down, son. Take a deep breath. Go slow so I can write this down. What the fuck? This is an emergency. All right, slow down. Explain what's going on. All right, look, my friend went outside and got attacked by his girlfriend. Only it wasn't his girlfriend. And now she's missing and he's hurt. We just need fucking units here ASAP. Okay, so it was a domestic incident. She attacked him? Yes. I mean, no. -I mean-- -Son. -Where is she now? -I don't know. And your friend who attacked him? -There were two of 'em. -Two of who? What? Uh, Tom, my friend. -Son, are you on drugs? -No. No, no shrooms, no LSD. I mean, we smoked a little pot, but, like, that doesn't make you see two people. I'm just saying you're slurring your words, and what you're saying doesn't make sense at all here, son. Look, we just need help. Get some fucking units out here ASAP. I'm sending patrol unit over. They'll be there in an hour or so. An hour? Are you fucking kidding me? Is it 'cause I said we smoked? You're 50 miles away here, son. Not much I can do. Jesus fucking Christ! You're useless. Fucking kids. [suspenseful music] -What did they say? -They didn't believe me. They thought we were on drugs. Are they at least sending help? Yeah, in an hour. We could be dead by then. I think we should pack our shit and meet the cops halfway. No, no, I'm not leaving Ashley behind. Listen, we don't know where the fuck she is. She could be-- Call Joe. Call Joe! Okay. -Hello? This is Joe. -We need you to get here now. Something hurt my friend and our other friend is missing. But I, I, I think she's hurt, too. All right, all right. Slow down. What'd they look like? I don't know, but I think they're gonna try to break in. Listen, don't worry. I'll be right there. Lock yourself in. Roger, come up. Somebody breaking in in the cabin. They're just fucking with you, Joe. It's a prank. Okay, Joe said he's coming. He's close. All we gotta do is wait. -How are you holding up? -[exhales] [exhales] I mean, better. [knocking] Tracy, come outside. I have these. Come on, you can escape through the woods. Come, try. Where is my friend? I am your friend. Don't you remember me? What did you do to her? Don't listen to her. She's just trying to confuse us. That's not Ashley. I just, I just want to get out of here, okay? Dylan, how about we make a deal? Here's a deal. Fuck you! Well, that wasn't very nice. You haven't even heard what I have to offer. I let you go if you give me Tom. How does that sound? You're not Ashley. Fine. No deal. I'm going to chop up your little girlfriend and then kill you. Oh, God, it's going to-- It's going to kill us. No, just don't listen to it. It's just trying to fuck with us. No, we're-- We're not gonna get out of here alive, are we? We will. We just, we have to stay put. Joe's coming. He'll help us, okay? We just got to stay focused. How's he doing? He's still bleeding, but I think he'll be all right. -How's the bleeding? -[Tracy] I think it's finally stopped. Hey, Tom, just hold on a little longer, okay? Joe's on his way. [ominous music] Fuck! Go. Take Tracy, and get out of here. -What? -I can stop it. Go. -No. -Go now! Tom, don't please. It-- [intense music] Oh, shit. Dylan! Come on, we have to go. [Tom coughing] [groaning, gagging] [both panting] Come on. You okay? You're bleeding really bad. We need to get to the road. We can flag somebody down. What the fuck are you talking about? We'll never make it. It will get us. I have a plan. [grunting] [dramatic music] [cloth ripping] Stay close. [grunts] [dramatic music continues] -[grunts] -Hey, come on. Come on. [grunting] [crickets chirping] -[grunts] -Hey. You take the torch, and keep going. I'll be right behind you. Stay close. Please. -We can do it. [grunts] -Come on. [panting] [dramatic music] [panting] [engine whirring] [Tracy panting] [Tracy] We need to keep moving. What if this fire's out? I just need a second to catch my breath. -Come on, come on. We have to go. Come on. -Okay, okay. [grunts] [dramatic music] [panting] Fuck! Darn it! Damn it! [Tracy panting] Come on. [music intensifies] [breathing heavily] Dylan, come on. We have to hurry. Please. [ominous music] [panting] [panting] Come on, Dylan, please. Hey. [groans] We need a change of plan. What? What are you talking about? You take the torch and keep going. No. No, no, I'm not leaving you here to die alone. -I'm not fucking leaving you -We don't have a choice. Fire's dwindling. And at the rate we're going together, we're not gonna make it. There has to be another way. The road is so close. -Joe will find us. Please! -Tracy. -No, we can stay and fight together! -Tracy! -I'll fight with you. Please! -Tracy. We don't have time to talk about this. You gotta get to the road and keep going. And then you can get out. You don't stand a chance without fire. I'm not leaving you here to die alone. Please! I can hold my own. I, I'll kill it, and then I'll meet you at the road. You promise? I promise, okay? Now go. -Go. -[sobs] [sobs] [Dylan panting] [panting] [tense music] [panting] [grunts] Oh, my gosh. Just give me a minute. I'll be right there. [panting] [groans] [breathing heavily] All right. Come on, motherfucker! Come get me. I said, come get me. [panting] [ominous music] -[grunts] -Shit. [both grunting] [hyperventilating] [chuckles] Fuck! Fuck, fuck! [grunts] [grunts] Shh. [hyperventilating] Shh. It's okay. -It'll all be over soon. -[grunts] [grunts] Stop. [grunts, groans] [breath shuddering] [ominous music] [gasps] [panting] [panting] [Tracy] Where the fuck is it? Where is he? Please! [sobs] Oh God, please! [Ashley] There's no point in running. No, don't listen to her. Don't listen to her. Please, we have to keep moving. -Keep moving. Keep moving. Keep moving. -We're friends, remember? -Just trust me. -Come on, come on, come on. -Please. -The fire's dwindling. -You'll never make it. -[breath shuddering] No, no, no, no. [sobs] God, no, please. I can make it. I can make it. -It's so close. Fuck. -[laughing] [laughing] [continues laughing] Damn way. Come on. -[panting] Wait, please. -[Joe] What? -Stop, please help! Help! -Holy shit, it's the girl from the cabin. Help! Help, please! Please help me! -Help, please! Please help me! Please-- -What the-- What happened? -What? What happened? -[speaking indistinctly] -Where did it go? Show me. -[speaking indistinctly] -Come on, come on, show me. -It's this way. Please help. Hurry up! [mumbling] -Come on. -Show me. Show me. Where did you last see her? [Tracy] I think it's right there. No, no, this way. -Come on. -What happened? [Tracy] It took him, it took Dylan. -[Joe] Where? -[Tracy] No. Further. Please hurry. Hurry! I left-- He's right here. I left it right here. My God, he's dead. Kill it, please! Please don't let it be him. [sobs] Help him!
