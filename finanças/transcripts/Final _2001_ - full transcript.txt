And its purpose? -Something. -For example? Research or some government thing. Okay, so let me see if I understand you, then. Some future government or society has allocated financial resources, significant resources, -in order to deceive one man from the past? -Yeah. So they've reconstructed a 2,000-bed hospital, bricks circa 1926... they've fabricated vehicles, rooms, period wardrobes, they've gathered doctors and staff... they trained them to portray their counterparts from 500 years ago, all to deceive this man-- you? That's right. Can you tell me what happened at the quarry? [grunts] -Your truck was wrecked. -No. They found you at the base of a cliff. No, I don't know. [Ann] You were unconscious. [Bill] No. [Ann] They brought you here. [Bill] I was on a table. [Ann] In the emergency room. [Bill] No, after that. My mother was there. [Ann] In the ICU. [Bill] They froze me. -I could have gotten to him. -To who? [Bill] It was dark. [Ann] In the comatose ward. You were there for three days and then you began breathing on your own. I'm going. -Bill, wait! -Right here! [fast tempo guitar music] -Bill, wait! -[grunts] [distorted electronic sounds] [grunting] [grunts] Where is it? Where the fuck is it?! -I know it's here. -It's all right now. Where is it, Ann? Where the fuck is it? It's all right. Shit, my finger. I fucked up my finger. -It's all-- -Sherry! Hey! Sherry. Hey. Baby, I fucked up my hand. It's all right. Sherry, I fucked up my playin' hand. It's okay, Billy. What was I thinkin'? Hey, Ann, don't kill me, please. Ann! Ann! Please don't kill me. Please? -It's okay. -[panting] I could've-- I could've run to the parking lot. What was I doin'? What was I afraid of? Was I afraid somebody might think I look stupid or something? It's okay. I could've taken the stairs five at a time, easy. -That's the least I could've done. -Shh. What was I doin'? What was I doin', Ann? What was I doin'? I'm crazy. No. This is 1999. This is Connecticut. You're my therapist. Yes. You're Ann. Yes. Think I might like to give Sherry a call. I'll see what I can do.

I am so proud of you. [soft acoustic guitar music] Mommy would be, too. Tough day at the office? I'm going out for coffee. Did you want to-- Oh, thank you, Edward, but I think I should sleep before the next round. I can bring you something. That's okay. Thank you, Edward. No problem. I'll see you at 9:00.

Did you take this off? ♪ How's Mary? Sorry to keep you all waiting. It's, uh... It's been an interesting morning so far. -You guys got any coffee? -It's right there. Ah. I, uh... would like to begin with several developments that have come into play since Friday. Wait a second. But where are we at with the two of them? All right. There is on-schedule progress with both candidates. The male is coming along slightly faster, primarily because he has no pre-existing medical conditions. The woman has lagged somewhat due to side effects caused by complications from... what? -Lymphoma. -Thank you. -In any event-- -All right, so the male's ready to go. Physically, his motor skills are nearly normal, his power of speech is normal. What about his cognitive responses? Why don't I just lay out the points of our report, and then if you have questions... -Go ahead. -Thank you. His retention and logic are fine, however, there are still problems with... intermittent delusional episodes, hostile outbursts, and occasional disorientation? I would say that that's improved. You are? Dr. Johnson, the primary on the case. Hm. Go ahead, honey. Bill is-- the subject is nearly stabilized, and I would say that barring any unforeseen setbacks, he will be ready for the orient to consent very soon. How many days are we looking at? Well, it-- it's difficult to schedule. I'd say 24 to 36 hours. I'm not sure that I agree with that. Oh, I see. You're not sure if you agree. [Ann] I assure you... that I am as eager as anyone, if not more so, to see-- May I interrupt here? We share your concern for the patient's timely orientation. However, in light of the events of the past 24 hours-- If you rush him, he will not consent. He's going to have to, Doctor. It was my understanding that this was a voluntary process. -Of course, that is protocol. -At this point. The subject must be adjudged competent. No, no, no, no. It's been waived. I wasn't advised of that. You are now. [Supervisor] Wait, now I'm confused. The parameters are what, then? Video taped voluntary signature. He won't consent. Keep waiting to hear something helpful from you, Doctor. Yeah, I could speak to him. [Supervisor] Thank you, Dr. Manning. That won't be necessary. What about an interim consent? -Uh, to surgery only, not the term inject? -Correct. Not as bulletproof, but maintainable under moderate challenge. Excuse me? Lie to him and then kill him? Why don't we just kill him? Hm, that would be illegal, wouldn't it? I can't expose the administration to-- Term inject this afternoon. Digitize the signing videotape. I mean, what are we talking about here? I'm afraid I can't comment on that. From what I understand, the subject is dangerously unstable. -He's a borderline psychotic. -What? There's virtually no possibility of a competency ruling or a voluntary consent in the near future. -I don't see why we're hesitating. -Edward! [Edward] I'm also sorry to add that based on my observation, it's highly likely that Dr. Johnson is too emotionally involved with the subject to perceive the larger issues clearly, and I think she should be removed from the case. What the fuck are you talking about? [Supervisor] Thank you, Dr. Johnson. Thank you both for your input. We do try to keep these meetings somewhat freewheeling here, but in the interest of time, I'm going to dismiss you and Dr. Manning. Now. Thank you. Well, I gotta get a helicopter in 20 minutes, so why don't we wrap this thing up? -What is wrong with you? -Ann. Ann, look. You of all people would seem to have a compelling interest in expediting this process. Yes, but we have to follow procedure here. -We can't-- -Bullshit. Let a thousand people die per day -so a mentally deranged relic can live for another two weeks? -Mentally deranged relic? -What are you talking about? -How can you defend that position? -On what ground? -Moral. We don't know if he's gonna be useful. We don't even know what this is, Edward. He's a revived cryogen, Caucasian male in his late 30s, or the exact profile of the Belgian subject, the only other positive supplier today. What? [tense music] I... -[Ann's voice, overlapping] October the 24th... -...1926... -...six months... -...ten days... [Bill's mom] Your dad's not doing so well. [Ann] And I want you to trust me. You want to push it back? [Ann] Way back... Harder, harder... -Billy? -Sherry? Good morning, Bill. Hey, how you doin'? It's my responsibility to inform you that you are a ward of the United States Government. Yeah. And to notify you of your selection for a national health project. Uh-huh.

[supervisor] This one is from February 10, 2000. This form authorizes your transfer to the comatose ward. Again, your mother's signature about two-thirds of the way down the page. Right. -Sherry signed this? -[door buzzes] -Excuse me, I-- -Just a moment. Please listen carefully. You were in a coma for approximately two and a half years, and during that time your mother passed away. -She had named Sherry Winslow executrix of her estates. -Sherry Clarke. The medical opinion was that you would make no recovery. That you would remain in a coma until your death. Now, February 10, 2003... Mrs. Winslow was given the option of remanding you to an experimental cryogenics research program, which she did. -By that time, it's standard-- -Doctor. Three months ago, 25 years after your freezing, you were successfully revived. [Ann] There were only 11 revivals out of 300 cryogens in this country. This is a consent form for a surgical operation, the dangers of which are fully outlined. -At this time-- -[Ann] Bill. -Doctor. -I'm sorry. This is something you can elect not to sign. -Uh-huh. -[man] That is correct. However, we are now authorized to exercise forced consent at our discretion. -Which means that it wouldn't-- -[Ann] But if you wish, then you may-- -Absolutely. -[man] Yes, if you wish. Ah! [quiet, tense music] You've just been given a mild sedative. In approximately 25 minutes you will be further sedated in preparation for your surgery.
