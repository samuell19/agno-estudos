Hey, Nando. What's up, Lipe! You look different. Sorry I didn't show up sooner. I got tied up at work. Don't worry about it. We'll get together for dinner tomorrow. - How did you get that, Nando? - It was nothing Forget about it. I'm going to my room and change, okay? Okay. Welcome, Nando. Thanks, Lipe. Lipe, you come and go like that. - You came in really late. - I know. Son, you promised you'd be here for dinner. I said I was sorry, mom. You have to apologize to me, not your brother. What, you want me to sit down on the table and do what? Should I coddle him, like you've done all his life? I didn't coddle your brother. I didn't coddle him and I'm not coddling you! All I want is for you to be closer to us. - Lipe, where are you going? - Out to drink. Gonna get drunk at the bar, could I? ARTIFICIAL PARADISES Hey, the fagged is arriving. What's up? - How are you? - It was hard to find the club. I bet you're Brazilian. And you're the DJ. How could you tell? Dancing with you eyes closed... They were closed, But I was seeing you. Even I, the guest DJ, don't got the free pass to get in here. A Brazilian friend of mine. Full of contacts. - Let's have a drink? - Sure. - Is that your friend? - He's the friend of a friend. But he got us the invitations. Are you just visiting Amsterdam? First time, I came for a ride. here before. Do you live here? I've been living here for a while. I used to play in Brazil and my agent got me a few places here. Lucky girl! You do what you like in an amazing city! - Wanna take it? - No, thanks. - Patrick! - What's up Anderson! Have you seen Nando? How did you get in here? Did he gave you the password? No, it was a girl. I fucked in the bathroom. Thanks for the invitation. It's a great party. I'll be eternally grateful. One day I'll move to this country. TWO YEARS EARLIER NORTHEASTERN BRAZIL ls everything okay? Yeah. I'm fine, thanks. People say that one day, all of this will end. All of what? Everything Nature, the world. 2012, do you know it? - Planet X. - I've heard about it. There won't be anything left. - Is that why you're crying? - No. I'm crying because I find it beautiful. What's that one? - Which one? - That. This one. Peyote. - Really? - Have you ever tried it? It can be a deep, intense journey of self-consciousness. You want some, dear? Is that what you're looking for? I'm still not sure what I'm looking for. This plant is an entheogen. Sacred. The whole idea of this psychedelic trip is transcending conscience. To commune with the divine. Listen up. Have the utmost care. Too much wisdom is hell on the stomach. It has been scientifically proven that excess selt-consciousness is vomit-inducing. Better take some LSD for a chaser. I'm good, thanks. Have a nice trip. Nervous for your set? A little. I don't know. Just scared that I'll get nervous and won't manage to put on my best show. I'll build it up in my head and end up frustrated. The way I see it, you should feel confident 'cause you've been making it happen. You have great taste, and study like crazy. And my intuition tells me that it will be amazing. You know that my intuition is powerful. You know it! Promise that you'll be watching out there in front? Of course! Miss your first festival? I'm not crazy! You're going to rock. Lara, check out what Mark gave me. - You know what that is? - Peyote! I can't believe it. Let's do it now. Naturally. - Now? Are you nuts? - Look at this place, Erika! Look! We're meant to do it. Let's do it now. Take the smaller piece 'cause you were sick earlier. - No way, the big one is mine! - God! Let's go for a ride. Oh my God! It's all right. Come back, come back. What happened, Erika? I don't know what happened... I don't know... Open your mounth like this. Yes, well done! Can I do it? When that fag showed up with his black friend, I got crazy paranoid and thought it was the cops. I was about to flush my stash down the toilet. Nice, Patrick. What about my part? You'd leave me out to dry? Some friend you are, man. What's this crap? I'd never let you down. - You're my brother, man. - Real punk you are. I love you, man. Let me tip this guy. I'm broke. The chicks here are hot! What are you drawing? A house for us to live in? Is this? you're gonna draw? Hey, Mouse. Baby, good talking to you! to find you! - How was the gig? - It was wonderful. Shame you couldn't come. Everything worked great. Baby, I'm talking about Ibiza and Barcelona. We're gonna make it happen! Full speed ahead! My dear, You're the one! - We have new gigs all over Europe. - Okay. Your secretary mess up with last week's pay. - I'll sort that out for you. - Please do. Relax. But if I'm spending more than two days away, I have to bring Thomaz with me, okay? Right, Patrick. I got it. I'm just congratulating you for finally getting laid! You did it, right? - Did you get laid? - Do you mind. Excuse me. Get away You didn't. I can't believe it, man. - Nope. - Fuck, you're such a chump! How in the world It's impossible, I can't believe. Hello? Hey, Lipe- - Who's this? - It's me, Nando. Hey, Nando. What's up? - Is mom there? - Sure, wanna talk to her? Nah, I called for you, No, I wanna talk to you. Listen up, I'm in Amsterdam. Holland, man. - What are you doing there? - But don't tell mom. Got it? I told her I'd be in Sao Paulo so she wouldn't freak out and start asking questions. You know how she can be a hassle. Right, I got it. Lipe! - Is that Nando, son? - Yeah. - Send him a kiss from me. - Okay. Anyway, I just wanted you to know. You're my brother, so you gotta know. So, is it cool over there? Have you had any weed yet? - Sure. - Watch out on what you're doing. Cool. Don't worry, it's just a thing with Patrick. All right, cool. - Hey, let me talk to him. - Hold on. Yo ET, I'm buying youa plastic pussy so you can pop your cherry! Hey. Right on, Nando. Take care over there, and bring me something cool. Right on. Love ya, lil' man. - What did he say? - That you're a jackass! Red Light District, man. Let's do it. I gotta see that Cornelius exhibit, remember? The one by Mark's friend. Dude, it's your last chance to fuck someone in Amsterdam. Fuck her for me. You know, you're the only square DJ I know. I had my days too. - I wasn't always like this. - Well, well. But you could've tripped But you could've taken. - No big deal. - I know. It's just that I don't do that stuff. Honestly, my first ecstasy was so incredible that all the other times seemed a deception. Nando, I'd like to tell you something. The first time I saw you wasn't at that party. That's strange what you're saying, 'cause I feel like I know you from somewhere. Where was it? Forget it, I tell you later. - Please tell me. - No, forget it. You not going to tell me, right? - Let's go. - Wait, I think that's him over there. - Him? - Yeah. - Won't you talk to him? - Should I? Go on! Hurry. Let's see what you picked out. I'll give you a hand. I'm getting them for ET, actually. - Who? - ET, that's my brother. - You call your brother "ET"? - Yeah. - He gets pissed off. - I can imagine. - Have you paid it all? - Sure. Did you see this? He put this up all over town. This will never work. You should have more faith in the universe. - Look at this! - Dear, this year will be especial. Look at the tents there. I really need to be here. Dude, this place is too beautiful. Feel the vibration here, brother. Hey Pat, I think my father got really upset with me. - What's up? - I not on his birthday. My parents don't even know where I am. Relax. He planed a fishing trip with me and Lipe and I blew it. Your father should be happy knowing that you're happy. Have you ever pictured yourself when you're old? - Actually, yeah. - Really? - It's fun for me. - No way! I'm serious. - I think we'll be happy. - Yeah? I see myself wrinkled like an ancient passion fruit. From burning up in the sun, I tell you to use sunblock, but it's no use. You drive me crazy with that. Seriously, though. Brigitte Bardot. With a bunch of cats. I guess I'll be rich, since I'll be a famous author with a collection of perfumes. Full of obsessions. Widow from my third husband! - You killed all three? - With your help. - As for you... - Let's hear it. I see you... Well, I see myself visiting you and you're a bit cranky. Why? - Cursing your husband - No way I don't want it. I want to be like Mark. - On a bus, going to raves... - Now I'm jealous. But I see you happy. Very happy. Enough, I don't want to dwell on that any more. Let's think about right now. Yeah, you're right. No need for that. All I know... is that I want to be close to you. To the end. Nando? I'm off to meet Carlao, bro. - Cool? - Yeah, go ahead. Shit, you're like autistic when you draw. Meet me in half an hour at the alternative stage. - Did you hear me? - Sure, I'll be there. Far out, man. Reminds me of that Escher cat. Are you an artist, man? I can't say I'm something I haven't been paid to be. You are what you feel, brother. In that case, my friend, I'm just a student. I have a friend, Cornelius Adler. - Do you know him? - No. He waited his whole life to feel like an artist. He makes thousands of dollars creating album covers, but can't create anything for himself. It's sad, man. Really sad. He never understood that just by wanting to be, he had become an artist. He already is. You feel me? He waited for that which doesn't exist, man. So want happened to him? These days, he's a professor at the best design school in Amsterdam. You're kidding. Maybe I'll get you a hook up with that. I don't wanna be someone cursing at my husband. I was kidding, wacko! No, you weren't! Fine, so we'll share a husband. When he gets tiresome, we kill him together. Have you ever shared someone? I think I'd like to try that. Really? If it's with you, sure. Here, Erika. This is so I never forget that I have all I need. You and the sun. I want to give you something for luck. What? You're going to bring the house down. It's your medallion. I can't. It's yours. No, it's the left side! You always mix it up. Right. Can you do it at the same height? - The same place. - Sure. Just like that, no problem. Hey Patrick, let's talk when you get back to Rio. - What's up? - Don't worry about it. Go on. Good to see you. You can bet that your dad is chilling right now, smoking a pipe at home. He may be angry, but that doesn't last. I'm a dad too, my man. I know the deal. He tries to push me to study abroad and carve my own path. Sometimes I think I'm wasting time here, Mark. You're growing as a person. You're developing your psyche. That's important too. Happy birthday, dad. I got the stuff, bro. How much was it? Thirty bucks a pop. - Give me 3, Patrick. - 90 bucks, Dud... She's looking to buy. Have some before it's gone, bro. Let's do it, Nando. You never forget. The first ecstasy, you never forget. Let's do it. The ecstasy I'll bring tomorrow... The other stuff is on you... You're a spoiled little boy... You chose to be here by your own... You need easy money... I'm not coming back. I felt in Love with a woman... Carlao is waiting for us... Could be your life's chance... - You can't give it up - Good bye. I paid for your ticket, but the alteration fee and extra hotel stay are on you. Right. I have better things to do than wipe a daddy's boy's ass. I postponed it, but I'm going through with it. One thousand acid tablets. Put that inside a book. And calm down. You'll tip them off if you show up like that. Take care. Is everything okay? You look so different. Is anything the matter? You can tell me. No, everything is fine. Just some issues back home. My mom isn't well. - Is she sick? - No. About two years ago, I was supposed to go diving with my dad and my brother. - Your brother ET? - Right. But when the time came, I flaked out and traveled instead. My dad was a great diver, but that time, when he went under, something happened that we never figured out. He blacked out. His body vanished, Erika. My dad was gone. Wow. I just felt that if I'd been there, things could have turned out differently. You shouldn't see it like that, though. I've been through something like that where I thought I could have played it differently. But later I realized that it was just guilt Deep down, we'll never find out if we could have changed anything. It's no use. Yeah, I don't know. My family was twisted inside out. - Our house... - I can imagine. It took a while for me to figure out that from that point on, I'd have to rely on myself. Can I show you something? Of course. He's your spitting image. Just like you. Beautiful. So when do I get to meet him? Do you really need to go back to Brazil tomorrow? Yeah. Dad: Dad: Dad: Dad: Everything groovy, How are you, my princess? Did you find what you didn't know you were looking for? No. I had a really bad trip. It was horrible. Really? I was so scared. I experienced fears I didn't even know I had. I don't know. There was that car accident, and I got it all mixed up. I don't know... I guess I regret taking it. Your angels and demons are all inside you. Drugs cannot create a reality unknown to you. They are simply potentialize What's already there People take from drugs whatever they want. The big question is: do they want what's best for them? Babe, it's time for your set. - I'm playing now. - Awesome. She's going to drive the dance floor wild. Let's go, guys. Erika is playing now. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm okay. I've had this cough since I was a kid. Never mind. Hey. Erika, dear. Do you what an ecstasy? Thank you so much. Thanks, it was great. This is Mouse, who I meant to introduce. - Pleasure. - How's it going? He runs a DJ agency in Europe. Listen, I've heard great things about you. - Thanks. - Your set was amazing. Here's my business card, baby. There's a massive party going on next week and I'd love for you to play. Really? If we can keep this vibe and this energy going, you may be sure that it'll be the first of many. The Brazilian crowd is bumping in Europe and I have a killer connection in Amsterdam. Hey, come here. Don't I know you? Depends. What do you have there? My fame has spread this far? Guess I should watch my step. No, that's not it. Sorry. Pierre told me about you. You know? - What's your name? - Lara! Did you catch the end of my set? Of course, babe. You rocked. It was epic. This here is my soul mate. She just played and crushed the alternative stage. - We have to celebrate. - Yeah! What do you have for us? A special gift for the rookie DJ. GHB. But listen, don't mix it with anything else, specially alcohol. Got it? Hey, Carlao. What's happening, bro? Getting to know my future contract star? Look at that! - I gotta talk to you. - Come on, then. I'll see you later. Don't forget it, just one drop! Thanks. - I found one. - What. - Nine and a half, at least. - Really! - Wanna go after him? - Yeah, right now. - Do you trust me? - Absolutely! Let's go! I love the drawing that you gave me. I'm going to miss you so much! I want you to keep this. That's your notebook. I can't. It's a part of me That I want you to keep. Nando, I already have a part of you with me. - That's what I wanted to tell you... - Erika. I haven't been honest with you. I'm not here just on vacation. I'm taking some things back to Brazil. Oh Nando... So you know Anderson? Yes I Know him. You lied to me this whole time, Nando? What choice did I have? - I gave my word, Erika - It doesn't matter, I love you! I know you love me. I love you! Look I go to Brazil. - When I come back, - Don't come back. If I'd told the truth, you wouldn't be with me. You wouldn't know me. - I don't know you now. - Yes, you do. - I don't know you any more. - We are what we feel. You rather not come back. Don't say that. Out of the way! What did she take? I don't know, she just crumpled in front of me. - You're not her friend? - I'd never seen her before! In that case, get out of here. Bring her here, fast. Overdose, doctor? Bring the syringe. Double dose of atropine. Pulse zero. Can I show you something? Of course. So when do I get to meet him? Hey, my friend. You, sir. Head to the counter. Palhares, go through the kid's backpack. Go ahead. 4 YEARS LATER. I don't know what to do with your brother. You see how he talks to me? He yells, and has no respect for me. I don't know where he goes, or who he's seeing. That's not the issue, mom. You knew all my friends, and I still fucked up. Deep down, your brother may be right. I coddled the two of you too much. Mom, calm down. I'll talk to him and figure this out. We'll be fine. You're too tense, mom. It's so hard, son. There's a stranger in the house. More of a stranger than you, who just arrived. My man! Do you mind? - Lipe, I need to talk to you. - Sure, sit down. - Let me go. - It's serious, Lipe. - What are you doing with them? - I'm drinking. - With Patrick and Carlao? - That's right. So what? Damn it, Lipe. I went into your room and found a bag of ecstasy. Are you taking that shit? Are you dealing? Are you crazy, Nando? Now you walk into my room and mess with my stuff? Shit, man. He came over here to lecture the kid? You smoked weed with dad ever since I was little! Like you're on some kind Who are you to tell me this now. Mind your own business. Have you seen mom's face? What she's been like? You can't talk to her like that. - Oh, I can't? - No! Nando, don't you see what's going on? You spent 4 years in prison. Mom visited you every day and was a wreck afterward She couldn't sleep because of you, Nando. Not because of me. - Now you want to blame me too? - It's not blame. - Can't you see what you're doing? - I'm just worried about you. - I'm your brother! - Okay, so chill. That shit you found is for me and some friends. Are you my father now, to straighten things out? Dad is dead, Nando. You can't solve shit now. Are you gonna make us a happy little family? Go straighten out your own fucking life, Nando. Goddamn it. Nando. - What do you want? - What's the matter, bro? - I'm your friend! - Friend, my ass. I saw you there with Carlao and my brother. So what? I'm just having a beer with him! - Fuck you, man. - Why are you being like that? Have you booked his trip to Amsterdam yet? Come on, man. "Amsterdam, easy money." What's your deal, man? - You're blaming me for that? - Damn right! You didn't want to go alone, so you called me. Did you lose your memory You lost your memory in prison!? I helped you to pay your father's debts. pay your father's debts. That shit you did with Carlao And oi screwed me up with Carlao too. Patrick... - You're an asshole, man. - You are. I'm telling you... Your brother is a man. Haven't you seen him long? It's funny that now you're worried about him 'cause you abandoned me in Amsterdam. I told you to come with me, but you stayed for some girl, right? Was she worth it? - Fuck you, Patrick. - No, fuck you. Go to hell. How's it going, man? - Where's Patrick? - He's on his way. Did you see who's here? The DJ who's playing tomorrow is in the house. We decided you gonna get the tickets for us. Get a move on. Work some magic. Go, 90. go- - Erika? - Hey. How's it going? My name is Felipe. Nice to meet you. I love your work. It's great. - Congratulations. - Great, thanks. It's cool, don't worry. Sonar I downloaded you set from Sonar. It's awesome. I must have listened to it over a hundred times. Great job I also read your interview for House Mag, remember? You said you understood that to be a better DJ, you had to remember the pain of your losses. I regret saying all that. Let's not talk about it. But it was a great interview. That was when I picked up that there's a minute in your set when you isolate the bass and make it heavier. It's almost like a minute of silence for your losses. That's fantastic. No one ever notices that, but you did. Awesome, thanks. It's 'cause I really like you. I'm your fan. My friends over there are also fans of yours. They all like you. Is there any way you could put us on the list? Sorry, I don't know the venue. - We really can't afford it. - I can't help, sorry. I can bring whatever you want tomorrow. - I don't... - LSD, candy... I don't want anything. Get out of my face. Please, go away. Get out of my sight. Dad: Dad: Dad. I'm not going with you guys. What do you mean? Remember that party in Recife? Yeah, a rave that happens every year. Patrick managed to get two free tickets. So, dad... I'm not going with you. Gotcha. All right. You rather go to a party insted of going fishing. Just this one time. Don't be upset. Goddammend. Don't forget that it's my birthday, man. - You owe me a fishing trip. - I know. - Go on, we're already late. - I love you. - Bye, kid. - Get back inside, Lipe. Come on, punk! You flake! A beer, please. What's up, Patrick? - Looking good, huh? - Nah, I feel like shit. Don't come with us tomorrow. Are you crazy, man? We agreed on this job. Now I'm going, I need the money. I like you a lot. As if you were my brother. You and Nando are my family. I'll give you the money. I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of guy. Sorry for being so rude. It's okay. What's your name again? - Felipe. But you can call me ET. - What?! ET? Today, I discussed with the tow people I most admire. My brother and you. Hey, Nando. Sorry about yesterday and what I said to you. Not just yesterday, but every time I wasn't there when you needed me. It was too much to me, Nando. It was really hard for me. I just started to realize you blame yourself for the way dad died and how I felt. after he vanished. I know you went to Amsterdam to try to help mom and I and to feel better about this whole thing. That's why I stopped coming to see you. I didn't have the guts to look in your eyes. I ran from you, but this has to stop. We can work it out, brother. I left you two invites for a party tonight. Don't ?ake out. I want you there. You'll pay for this, punk. I think I can do it. - I think I can do it. - Let me see Go on. Do it. Oh, fuck - What's up E.T., are you enjoying the ride? - Cutie. Attention, Federal Police! Hands up, no one moves! No. Lipe! Hands on your heads! There's a kid in the water, dammit! There is a young man in the water, sir. Leave that for later. Cuff them all. - He's gonna drown! - Keep your head down. One day, I'm gonna play in the snow. Really? - I'm going to China. - You are? What do you want to see in China? I'm gonna see if they have lakes there. Did you like the beach? - A little. - I thought you liked it. - Where's that ball you found? - Here. Do that thing I showed you. - What? - Throw it up with one hand. - Just one? - Do it for me. Great, but you can throw it higher.
