The Lemaistres make feverish preparations for an important visit. Etienne Landry, a rich industrial and a "brilliant match" is the person, who is expected by the Lemaistres. They arduously hope, that he will take one of their daughters for a wife. Julia, the loyal governess, is fully aware of the momentous visit.

Mrs. De Santa-Maria hereby has the honour of inviting you to the big garden party, that she is going to give Tuesday 21 July. The conflict. Landry was a simple business man and strict husband. His prosaic notions rose completely against the expensive outfits of his young wife... He could not imagine, that Evelyne, when she was chiquely dressed, felt happy... Mr. and Mrs. De Santa Maria... "I hope, you are not thinking of going to that party... our means don't afford us such dissipations..." "And moreover you must not forget, that today is the last reception day with Mrs. Lormoy, the godmother of our little George. I understand, that it is very unpleasant for you to go there but needs must. "It MUST... Mrs. Lormoy is very influential... and she can be of great use to our son later..." The will of the husband is an order for the wife. And so it was, that Evelyne came to consider the household more and more like a prison... Tuesday...the day, that the "annoying" Mrs. Lormoy considered a holiday. In her simple salons she received her friends and "introduc√©s" most cordial. One of the "terrors" of the house Lormoy: The conferencier... A month passed. Rosa, the sister of Landry, an example of an "old spinster" who contributes her bit to make domestic life into a hell. A letter. Mrs. Evelyne Landryy 42 Rue Duroc Local "Really don't you understand, my dear Etienne, that this is again a letter from Jacques Foucher... who in my humble opinion comes here far too often..." Mrs. Evelyne Landryy 42 Rue Duroc Local It's only four weeks ago, that I made your acquintance for the first time, Evelyne... And since that time I love you dearly. Every time I have to remember that walk, that we took together and during which you've entrusted me with your sad life. Since you keep refusing to come to me, I've decided to visit you today again for the last time, but then this is definately the last turn, for I urgently need to go to Norway... "By the way!... Do you know, when your friend Jacques Foucher leaves for "his" Norway?" The tea-hour. Jacques and his friend, Angel, a poet with very frivolous notions, but apart from that, a noble and fine young man. "Would you perhaps let us hear some of your poems, madam... You recite so excellently." The poem. "A thousand apologies... an urgent conference at city hall... see you next time... and safe journey!" "I thank you... but you should say see you SOON, because I have foregone my journey." "Haven't I said, that he wouldn't leave?" "Why I don't go forth?... Well, that is very simple... because I cannot live without you!" "Your visits are highly disagreeable to me... that has to stop... Have you understood me?" "I'd now like to go say goodbye briefly to Mrs. Landry, at least if you see nothing unpermissible in it..." "Your husband has understood everything, Evelyne, I cannot visit you anymore... we will never see each other again... or you should consent to run away with me..." "The healthy outdoor air shall do Evelyne well, and calm her nerves completely!" "...Until tonight I shall wait for you...so until tonight... or else everything ends!" "It must end... tonight we leave for Lyon... and that is agreed...!" And that evening, when the Lyon train departed... Evelyne. Third part. Now separated from her husband it however reaches Evelyne, that it isn't everything living by the side of a merry man like Jacques Foucher... Because the taste of Jacques has changed entirely. And while he surrenders entirely to his passion for the game, he worries little for Evelyne, who finds little comfort with his dubious friends... Miss Louli, who played a modest part in the previous revue. The frivolous life style of Jacques formed a sharp contrast to the modesty of Evelyne. "Oh, I'd almost forget... I'm having a cozy evening... do me the pleasure and come too... the more the merrier." Evelyne feigned a headache. Mrs., Your little George speaks often about you... He would so greatly hug you again. Your affectionate Julie. That same evening, during the supper, that Jacques offers his friends... Angel notices to his deep sadness the wounds which his friend Jacques inflicts upon the pitiable Evelyne with his unworthy behaviour. "What are you always thinking of?" "I think of a young man, that could have become a famour artist, but his lust for wealth and amusement have made him deeply unhappy." And in the small town a hardworking and deeply sad business man had returned... The disastrous consequences did not stay away... "Whose child is that?" A clean breast of it. Evelyne. Fourth part. Jacques has left, while Angel has died a few months before. To escape the torturing loneliness, Evelyne has become an artist and now leads an honest and labouring existance. Before his death Angel had written a play, in which Evelyne was to fill the lead, while there was also a small part in it for the boy, that rehearsed with Evelyne. And in the small, "monotonous" town... "Do you have a mother?" How surprisingly beautiful she would now find everything, that she had once so disdained... Evelyne Lemaistre in CHILD-KING And on a certain evening... "It's up to you, what to do, my dear friend, but I thought, you knew, that Evelyne is the "friend" of Angel, the writer of her plays..." "But I've seen them together myself just now!" Later... Program. The secret of the king's child by Mr. Angel. The talented author, Mister Angel, died around six months ago in the bloom of his life. He sadly could not reap the rewards of his work. Complicity! The surprise. By Evelyne's tears streams a genuine forgiveness. She had learned the hard way, well, she was going to take care, that her husband and her dear child would from now on lead an overhappy life with her. The end.
