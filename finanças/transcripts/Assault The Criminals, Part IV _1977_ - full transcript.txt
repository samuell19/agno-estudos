Three lives ended because of a social tragedy Some say gambling is the root of all evils If Rong did not gamble or become a junkie He should still have a family And lead a simple but good life Rong and Fang would not die so tragically Liu Gu was nothing but scum She should get no sympathy That's why one should always control one's destiny
