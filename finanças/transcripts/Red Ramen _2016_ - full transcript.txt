I'm Kate McCartney I'm Kate McLennan We're Up Ourselves and we're back with a newer, fresher, bigger more absorbant, easier to insert season of... ...the KATERING SHOW! Welcome to our world! How long do we have to stand here? The Director just said until he calls CUT. Who is the Director? I don't know some cunt stunt Welcome back to the Katering Show kitchen ...where absolutely nothing has changed ..Becauase we blew all our our budget on that opening shot ...and isn't it great to be back, McCartney? Yes Isn't It? I said yes! And so much has changed We're now getting paid minimum wage McCartney is a more marketable colourscape And the world is waiting for us to FAIL! The Pressure is Overwhelming! I can't breathe! (I actually can't breathe) In our first episode back we could choose to lampoon so many food trends ..because we have absolutely not spent the last 12 months on the couch with our tits out watching the Good Wife No we have not! No we could take a sassy swipe At crownuts those pasteries that look like a clock from a gingerbread man's autopsy. Or tackle austerity cooking - where rich people cook on a poor person's budget ...just 'cause it's fun! Or take on saracha where... I don't know what that is. Sri·ra·cha. What? Sri·ra·cha so there's two r's So it's pronounced sri·ra·cha right? That's how it's pronounced? Sri·ra·cha? sr..sr...sr-a... I 'm sorry! I'm sorry I'm just stressed. You're just stressed Yep. But in this episiode we want to give back to YOU our fans - who's fault all of this is! We've been overwhelmed! -with support With Support! Every day another devoted fan writes in Oh McCartney's food intolerences are just like mine! except they're not exactly like mine Do an episode about me! Me me me me me! They also shout - Do more viral take downs of food trends you bitch! When we're at the park with our kids! Well great feedback! (yeah!) So We've had a think and a bit of a cry and we have decided to take a sassy swipe at RAMEN. And inner city food trend that's really overhyped given what it is We can relate But not only that we are going to serve it and our many masters up on our very own on-trend 'The Katering Show Popup Ramen Bar Restaurant' And you and all your food intolerances are invited! Are you Fk'n happy now?!! Because if you are not, we will change it. Ramen Bars are everywhere in the inner city; they are to laneways what syringes were in the 90s. And they're full of non clad hipsters having conversations like Ahh ! Im writing a 600 page novel about my sad dick! I get my shoelaces ARTISAN tied I'm painting my face like a skeleton for my mexican day of the dead party But it's not offensive because i do makeup good! James told me he wants to have a polylamorous relationship - so now i have to have sex with the neighbors. Music festivals! Yeah! Music festivals! We'll be making a Ramen five different ways to cater to everyone's intolerances, beliefs, and abandonment issues. First up in our Ramen five-way We're going to make a Ramen burger. Youll recognize these if you are a trend driving millennial like me (you were born in the 70's!) And then for McCartney and the rest of the people who need a feacal implant We will be making a fodmap version Where we take out the onion, garlic, and the noodles. Next up a vegan Halal Kosher version that takes out the pork and the eggs but brings back in the onion, garlic, and noodles. And then an anaphylactic version where we take out the eggs, but bring back in the latex free condoms. And finally a pregnancy version where EVERYTHING's coming back in - except the egg. So there you have it - all the ingredients for our cheeky Ramen five-way. Let's get started! Christ! There are a lot of ingredients - aren't there. Yes we have over-comitted in every single aspect of this entire enterprise. Luckily I have my best friend McCartney here so i don't have to do it on my own. While McLennon makes the Ramen on her own I'm in charge of setting up our pop-up Ramen bar restaurant - at it's top secret location. Pop-up restaurants are just like normal restaurants, but they are cooler because they don't have a toilet. And with their modest budgets it takes a smart decorator - to really make them pop. So... This is Mclennan's garage. Ok so I am cooking all the elements - for our cheeky Ramen five-way umm ... and there is a lot on the go. But that's ok because I am a woman! I am good at multi-tasking. Ramen isn't something that you'd normally eat at home because no one can see you doing it. Sassy Swipe! Ok...these noodles do need a bit of water. They have adhered - to the bottom of the pot. Modern restaurant decor uses junk as other junk like pallets as furniture and old books as water jugs or whatever so that's what we are going to do in our pop-up Ramen bar. This is a boat motor. You can sit on it, you can eat off it... (Sigh)...I don't give a shit. Ok! So I have finally finished my Ramen burger which I made on my own - without any help - from anyone. Ok...I did miss a few steps ...becuase I pinned the recipe on Interest...P -pi-p-in - interest Just so you know on other cooking shows some shit licker would have already made this for me! Ah for Fk sake! ok ..its the booze revooze And i've been told to tell you it's a special fan request So let's just quickly do this. ok. Hi McCartney my name's Nathan Hello. And I'm allergic to alcohol. Nate... Could you do a Japanese inspired mocktail? Sure Nathan. Um -ok - this is gin. Gin is good for that time when you were laid off of your animation job and you started drinking by yourself at a Pokies at 12pm ...and it was your birthday. Um... For the non-alcolholic version, they can just take out the gin.

So here's our cheeky Ramen Five-Way Isn't this a great meal to kick of season two with The Katering Show! I don't know about you McCartney but i think this Ramen really lives up to my pretty unrealistic and frankly unfair expectations Oh I think it has exceeded them! Cheers to that! hhmmm - Is that straight gin? It is! Good on you! And McCartney you have done a marvelous job of our exclusive Pop-up Ramen Restaurant - Pop-up Ramen Bar. It looks like a cyclone ripped through a caravan park. Thank you! It's called Red Ramen. You know - like Red Ramen Red Ramen Ok! And now let's bring in our competition winning super fans! ...yeah there are no fans here; we're scared of people. And I only seem nice because Ive got fun hair. Please don't crucify us though; we need this. I cannot go back to selling tickets to Disney on Ice...I just can't! We are trying - our Fking best! Whew! I think we got away with that! Yup! Feel better? No. I'm going to scrub this until I hit bone. What did they do to you? You look like the Cardassian's addict Sister! I know! You look like an evil doll. Yes! I feel like I am in a Jonbenet play What are we going to do with all this food? I don't know just chuck it in the compost. What about the meat and the rats? I can't be expected to cater to the rat's food issues as well as all these other mother fkers! How do the logies work? Blow jobs.
