(birds cawing) (gentle music) (adventurous music) When we return What will we find Will the truth Boggle our minds The mystery Utterly deceiving Unmasking or believing all the lies Will we return To Savage Beach Where the mystery lies Just beyond our reach Where danger and adventure Hide a timeless treasure Till the lethal forces finally bring relief When we return To Savage Beach The messages you send Will they bring us peace Or will they confuse us lnvite us or deny us The victory we so wish could be PSavage Beach What will you teach Savage Beach Out of our reach Savage Beach Pls this the time Savage beach What will we find - [Ava] This is KSXY, Molokai, Hawaii. - Wow, Silk, that's some top. - Just a little something I threw on. - Well, your aim's a little low. - The rocket is launched. The Lacrosse Satellite will be in orbit and operational momentarily. Hmm, Commander Willow Black is gonna be here any minute. Silk, would you go out and meet her in front and show her the way in'? - Sure. Commander Black, it's good to see you again. - This is Ava, your very personal sextrologist, with some sizzle and spice to brighten your life. Now here's a little song to stimulate your senses. Commander Willow Black. I'd like to introduce you to our engineer, Harry the Cat. - Pleasure. The Lacrosse Satellite is in orbit. We should receive the image from it any minute. (computerized beeping) - Our LETHAL Force operators are all tide in to your transmissions. - That's good news, we love the action. After all, we are the Legion to Enforce Total Harmony and Law. - Here's the fax we've been waiting for. We tracked a terrorist group to an area outside of Dallas. We have a go order to shut them down. - We should be able to track the terrorist group visually via satellite. (somber music) - Ava, we need to give our agents time to gather round their short wave radios. - Well, this will alert our agents everywhere to tune in. - Good. (suspenseful music) (device beeping) - Hey Tiger, it's the satellite radio receiver from KSXY. - This is the call we've been waiting for, Tyler. I've been dying for some action. - [Ava] The weather on the mainland is heating up, especially in Dallas, Texas. Listen up and stay cool. Now it's time for some advice for our listeners from Ava, your radio sextrologist, on KSXY, always here to help with your love, sex, and relationship problems. (suspenseful music) To our Libra and Pisces listeners, beware of unwelcome strangers. A confrontation can explode faster than the trigger on an automatic weapon. - It's Ava, Doc. She's giving word to Tyler and Tiger about the gun runners in Texas. - Yeah, those terrorist bastards are loaded. They've managed to smuggle guns, rockets, high tech detonators, and plastic explosives from China and the Pacific rim up through Mexico into the heartland of our country. - Look to the heavens for sexual gratification. There are others on the same wavelength who are driven by a desire to interfere with the forces of virtue. (tense music) This is Ava again, your KSXY sextrologist. Sometimes you can see it all, but sometimes things can seem uncertain. (airplane engine roaring) - Look at that. There they are. - [Ava] Terrestrial angels will alighten your space to join with hard-driving achievers. The sign of the archer is ever-present. He has the ability to shoot at your heart for love or for death. Many intruders are gathering in your sphere. They will exchange gifts and pleasantries, and be on their way. (airplane engine roaring) (tires squealing) (boat engine stalling) - I wish we were in Texas to help our troops. - Tiger and Tyler will be fine. This is a major bust for our LETHAL Force Agency. They'll have plenty of backup once they locate the terrorists. - I'm feeling a bit nervous for them. I need to unwind. - It's amazing how you manage to do it, Cobra. Working undercover in a nightclub as a stripper. - Sometimes people can't see what's right in front of them. - Oh, I can see what's right in front of me, all right. But our job is to cover each other's asses. - It's a tough job, but somebody's gotta do it. (tense music) - This one's yours. - It's time to kick ass and take names. - We'll have more love and sex advice for you after this next beautiful song. - Tiger, lock in the hand receiver to the dish, we've gotta stay tuned to Ava. (device beeping) - We're back on track, sexy ones, and we hope you are too. This is Ava, along with my engineer, Harry the Cat, and we're bringing you the latest in sextrology advice. Think in terms of warm water on your bodies. - [Tiger] That's our signal, Tyler. Our targets have made it to the water. (boat engine rumbling) - They're stealing the agency boat. (Harry groans) - The Vindicator. - Neptune is the mysterious ruler which inspires many psychic powers. It can be painful to realize you are without vindication. (boat engine roaring) - That was Ava again. The good news is they've tracked the terrorists, they're on the water. - What's the bad news? - They've got our boat. (Tyler sighs) - Let's get 'em. (tense music) (boat engine roaring) (gunshots banging) Explosive tips, right? - Tyler, don't you know by now, everything I touch has a way of exploding? - How could I forget? (both chuckling) Let's go. - Okay. - Tiger. They're over there. Let's go. (both talking at once) - We gotta roll. Get it. - There they are. (tense music) (gunshots banging) (device beeping) (gunshots banging) (explosions booming) - Arrow, explosive tipped, what'd you expect? - Hey, I had something to do with it, too. (fire crackling) - [Widow] All right, they got the terrorists. - Ah, but the boat's toast. - Tiger and Tyler did a great job. - They sure did. (fire crackling) (soft jazz music) (ominous music) - Hello. - Sorry, Miss, this is a restricted security area. - I just opened up a pizza joint downstairs. It's called Sofia's. I just wanna hand out a few free samples. Do you want a piece? - I'll take two. - All right. Good thinkin'. Tastes really good. There you go. Enjoy it, darling. Don't worry, I'm just gonna go right down the hall. You can keep an eye on me. - If I have to. - Hi, ladies, I'm Sofia. I own the new pizza joint downstairs. Here are some samples, it's Sofia's finest. You girls are gonna love it, it's delicious. And wait till you try this ginger ale. Boy oh boy, it's really gonna quench your thirst. Mm-mm, there you go, now you girls have a nice day, okay? - Thank you. - [Woman] Thank you. - BB, something's wrong. (computer beeping) (dart gun bangs) (somber music) - Oh, thanks, babe. - You're welcome. (Tyler sighs) - We did good work today, Tiger. We deserve this. - I know we deserve this, but we have to stay tuned to Ava to see how our backup people made out. (device beeping) - [Ava] For all the people seeking escape, today was a very good day. Those who took flight are also in the fold. - Good, we got the guys on the plane before they made it to Mexico. - To our Pisces and Libra couple in Dallas, you should immediately react to your impulse to bond. It can be lethal not to. Any place or building will do. Get to it now. - This has been some day. - That's us, Tyler, we've gotta get to the LETHAL office now. (tense music) - What happened? - There were only three of us here. The rest of our people were out backing you up. - We were all knocked out by some gal posing as a pizza delivery person. One of our obsolete computer files was broken into. Come with me. (computer beeping) - Look at this, Tyler. Whoever broke in here made a copy of this disk. I can tell by the information on the readout. Now this shows a large area in the Pacifc. (computer beeping) Points out where many naval battles took place during World War ll. (computer beeping) This stuff is ancient history. - This archive is quite old. And you're right, Tiger, it dates back to World War ll. I'm somewhat familiar with this case. It deals with a shipment of gold which was confiscated from the Philippines by the Japanese army during the war. (mysterious music) The shipment was to be taken by boat to one of the Mariana Islands. - Storm is coming. You should wait another day. - The general has ordered us to depart today. - I envy your devotion. And I pray for your safety. - [Tyler] A storm forced the boat off course and it crashed on a small uncharted island. No one could find the boat or the men for over 40 years. Two of our operatives, Donna Hamilton and Taryn Kendall, were returning to Hawaii from Knox Island, where they delivered medicine to help control an epidemic. - Thank goodness we made it through the storm. We could save a lot of lives with this. - You betcha, good luck, Doctor. - [Tyler] They too met with a terrible storm and were forced to land on that same remote uncharted island, since known as Savage Beach. (thunder crashing) (electricity buzzing) - We've been hit! We're heading straight down, Donna, pull up, we gotta pull up! - Reduce power, throttle back. How's the elevator? Check air speed pressure, RPM. (suspenseful music) - Taryn, you're pretty close! You got it. - Savage Beach? - Savage because on that island, they were attacked by armed bandits who had access to a military computer. A computer which had analyzed and pinpointed the island. Donna and Taryn managed to escape after a major shootout with the bandits. - What happened to the gold? - It was returned to the Philippine government. - Yeah, but how does all this fit in, and why would this file be of interest now? - The leader of the bandits betrayed the Philippine government. His name was Rodrigo Martinez. He was close to my father. My father was with the Brazilian embassy based in Manila. One day, my father received a diary and several boxes of documents from Martinez. These items arrived a few years after the Savage Beach incident. My father gave me the diary before he died. It's a chronicle of how a good man can go bad. Martinez was a respected man, from one of the most prominent families in the Philippines. He had splendid political alliances, but he took the wrong path. There was a gold medallion in the diary. My father told me that it was for me, from Martinez. I've worn it ever since. When I was assigned to the LETHAL Force Department, I put the diary in Cobra's safe house in Beverly Hills, along with several of my other personal belongings. - You know Tyler, it's all coming together now. The terrorist group was a diversion. We had them nailed all the way. - Yeah, but the terrorists were set up too. Finding them was too easy. We wiped them out bang, bang. They even stole our boat. I don't think getting dead was on their agenda. - Sure, we go after them, leaving the office virtually wide open. - We've gotta get in touch with Commander Black and fill her in on this. We should also contact Cobra and Doc. They can bring the diary to us. - I'll hit the computer satellite fax and fill everyone in. - Good idea, do that. - Okay- - Could we be in for a treasure hunt? - You never know. I'm meeting with a new recruit. He's supposed to be one of the most knowledgeable men in the world on stolen treasures and embezzlement. - Who is he? - Washington wouldn't tell me. They said I'd recognize him. I'm going to meet him tomorrow in Los Angeles. He's flying in from Paris. I'll be in touch through Ava's broadcast. (phone beeps) (upbeat rock music) (tense music) (men grunting) - [Woman On Loudspeaker] Flight 203 nonstop from Dallas, Texas, arriving Honolulu International Airport, gate 50. (airplane engine roaring) (soft jazz music) - Your mission was a success. We will go to my penthouse to celebrate in the traditional way. (soft jazz music) Through the years, political bandits ordered stolen treasures to be hidden on a remote island in the Pacific. The only map to the island exists on two computer discs. This is a copy of disc number one, which you've duplicated from the LETHAL Force headquarters. I will get the other one. - Martinez, I'm fascinated with you, my love. This assignment has aroused my basic instinct. (soft jazz music) - Now that's the kind of loyalty I need. - This is the secure line. (phone ringing) (device beeps) - [Doc] Hello. - Doc, it's Tyler. - What's up? I've got my hands full. - I'll vouch for that. - I know you're up against it, Doc. But that Philippine diary in Cobra's den, we need you and Cobra to get it to us here in Dallas ASAP. - I'm ready to drop everything. We'll hop in the company plane and get it to you tomorrow morning. - Meanwhile, Willow is coming to LA to meet a new recruit. She'll fill you in. (device beeps) (tense music) - [Doc] Here it is. - Let's put it in the fly pack. (airplane engine roaring) - [Man On Loudspeaker] Flight 62, Paris, France, arriving Los Angeles International Airport. (Willow groans) ' YOu? You should be in prison. (both grunting) Book him, Fu. Murder one. - Willow, please don't headbutt me, we got lots to talk about. - You look different. What did you do? - Cut my hair short. Close to the wood. - Come on. Get in the car. - Look, Willow, believe it or not, the guy I killed was not a fed. - He's a fed. Get in there. (man shouting) - Delicious! Bring more. He was in fact a serial killer roaming the college campuses of the southwest. Your people gave me a commendation, and a reward of $100,000 for taking him out. - [Willow] Well what about all the money and treasures you stole'? - I spent three months in Lumpad Prison. - Oh, that country club. - You wouldn't say that if you ate there. - You know, we busted our asses to put you away, and you do three months' time. I can't believe you. You are such a showoff. And you're almost big enough for me to find attractive. - Baby, do not forget, no one can ever love me as much as I love myself. (both laughing) (mysterious music) (Fu chanting) (Fu shouting) - It's okay, Fu. The Warrior's on our side now. You two should meet. - Name is Fujitaka Bunichi Hus! Friends call me Fu. - Friends call me Warrior. I didn't realize you were so chubby. - I can't help it. My family abandoned me as a child. I was raised by waitresses. (Warrior chuckles) (Fu chuckles) What's that? - Six pack, dude. (both laughing) (man shouting) (suspenseful music) (men shouting) (men grunting) - Book 'em, Fu. - I've heard that before. - Make it quick, we got a meeting. - Book 'em? (tense music) - This model airplane is some piece of memorabilia. - It's our way of paying homage to Donna Hamilton and Taryn Kendall. - They were the first ladies of the LETHAL Force. - Fu, Warrior, and I will go back to KSXY on Molokai. Doc, since you and Cobra have already contacted Tyler and Tiger, take this diary to them and see what you can come up with. - Okay- - We'll leave for Dallas first thing in the morning. - Great. - [Man On Loudspeaker] Flight 161, departing Los Angeles for Honolulu, connections to the outer islands is ready for immediate boarding, gate 41B. (airplane engine roaring) - [Man On Loudspeaker] LETHAL Force Twin, this is Dallas Downtown Airport. You're clear to land, runway 16R. - [Doc] Roger that. (airplane engine roaring) (tense music) (motorcycle engines roaring) Hey. (Cobra gasps) (gunshots banging) Come on. Let's go. Bikes. (gunshots banging) - Damn. Come on. (man panting) (gunshots banging) (fire crackling) (motorcycle engine roaring) (gunshots banging) (man grunts) (gun clicking) (gunshots banging) (gun clicks) (gunshot bangs) - Huh? (device beeping) Huh? (Cobra growls) (explosions booming) - Yes. (phone ringing) (phone beeps) - Hello? - Yeah, Tyler, Cobra and I just hit town. - Yeah, and the town hit back. - I'll fill you in. - I'll contact Tiger. - We're on our way. (phone beeps) (somber music) - I'm coordinating the disc we got from the LETHAL office with the information from the diary. I can't seem to pinpoint the location of Savage Beach. There are literally hundreds of small uncharted islands to deal with. - Well there's nothing in this diary. We'll need more specifics to make it work. (Tiger sighs) - Hey Tiger, I'm starving. You have anything to eat? - There's that pizza in there. - I'll get it. - Okay. (computer beeping) (microwave beeping) (Cobra gasping) (mysterious music) - Oh my god! Look! - It's another disc. (computer beeping) - That's it, that's Savage Beach! - We found it! We need to get to Molokai to show this disc to Willow. (computer beeping) - Cobra and I will service the plane and file a flight plan. You guys meet us at the Dallas agency hangar in a couple of hours. - [Tyler] Okay. - I'm going to input all the coordinates on both discs. - Do that. - Okay. (computer beeping) (tense music) - Tiger. (speaking foreign language) (island music) (speaking foreign language) - [Man On Loudspeaker] LETHAL Force Twin, you're cleared for takeoff from Dallas Downtown Airport, runway 16R, good luck. (airplane engine roaring) (tense music) - It's from your contact man in Dallas. The agents are on their way here to Hawaii in their plane. - We need to make some plans. (airplane engine roaring) - Tower, this is LETHAL Force Twin. We are touchdown. West runway, Molokai Airport, thank you. You guys go ahead, I gotta make a call. Okay. (phone beeping) Ava, we just touched down. Yeah, we'll be right there. As you know, smuggling and looting was a way of life for me, before I got busted by Ms. Willow and Fu here. From what I've been able to gather from my former associates, millions of dollars and other treasures, including a priceless gold Buddha filled with diamonds, was confiscated by the Philippine regime. - Most of the money that was siphoned off, in the hundreds of millions, was laundered through US banks, offshore resources, and unlisted Swiss accounts. - Donna and Taryn thought Martinez had died on Savage Beach. That's not so. My Japanese connections have informed me that he survived an awful explosion, but he was seriously injured. He managed to return to the Philippines. - Once he got back to the Philippines, he made contact with his political powers. He ingratiated himself and convinced them that he could keep the stolen goods safe until they retired or vote him out of power. - The location of the island requires a lot of programming. I hope I can make sense of these coordinates. - Martinez is the man my father knew. He concealed a second disk in the diary he sent to my dad. - Yeah, but do we know that's the only copy of that disc? - Obviously, that's why we've been attacked by these bastards. Tiger and I will take the sea plane to get there. I'll put the package together. - I'll make another copy of the disc for use on the plane. - We'll patch them into the navigation autopilot. That should guide us right to Savage Beach. - What about Tyler and me? - It'll take a lot of fuel, Doc. And if you haven't noticed, you guys weigh more than we do. - Warrior, you and Fu should stay here and protect Ava's operation. Doc, Tyler, and I will sail there. You guys up to that? - Yeah, sure. - I was born for water sports. I'll help you through it all, pal. (tense music) - By now, the agents have gotten the second disc to a computer, and are preparing to go to Savage Beach to find the stolen treasures. (Rodrigo laughing) Those agents will be in for a surprise once they find the island. - It'll be well worth it, my love. I wanna be a part of you, to help you. - My first assignment for you, after we finish our business here, is for you to pay a visit to our friend Tyler. - Why can't I see behind your mask? What do you hide there? - Someday, my dear, I'll reveal everything to you, but for now, there are parts of you I want to reveal to me. (gentle eastern music) - We'll be in the vicinity of Savage Beach Island in about 12 hours, depending upon the weather and the wind. - I've got the original disc copies right here. See you in a few days. Radio okay? - Loud and clear. - You guys picking up Ava's radio transmission all right'? - Also loud and clear. - [Tyler] Good luck, ladies. (airplane engine roaring) (tense music) (men grunting) - No, Tochi. Don't kill him. We need him to tell the others what happened here. They will panic and we can make our move toward the secret island. Help me with Tyler. Search him, he has the disc. Come on, bring him with us. (tense music) - Tyler. Tyler's been kidnapped. Four ninjas ambushed us. One was a woman. We never saw 'em coming. They stole the coordinating discs. Cobra and Tyler are gonna be in terrible danger once they reach their destination. - Certainly they'll hold Tyler as hostage. Insurance against any part of their plan failing. - Doc, we sail at dawn. We'll maintain radio contact with Cobra and Tiger through Ava. They'll navigate us to Savage Beach. Warrior, would you take a walk with me? Haven't you ever met a woman who could make you happy? - Sure. Three or four times a week. (Warrior laughing) (tense music) - Come on, move it. - [Man] Come on, get down there. (machinery whirring) (radar beeping) - The facts are, Doc and Willow have sailed off to a desert island. Cobra, it's Ava. Listen, Tyler has run into a storm and hasn't been seen since. Mercury, your ruler, cannot protect you. Beware of unsavory intruders. - [Tiger] We've found it, Cobra. There's Savage Beach. (tense music) (water splashing) Let's taxi to that cove, over there. (radar beeping) - [Man] Get down. (devices beeping) (Fu grunting) - Ava. A suspicious group paid off the manager and took a submarine from the Maui wharf this morning. - A submarine? We can't track underwater with the Lacrosse Satellite. - Those bastards are smart. They know that we're onto them. (tense music) (devices beeping) - [Tiger] It's gotta be around here somewhere. - I'm getting something. It's to the left. You're not getting anything? - Nothing on this side. - Wait a minute. Right here. It's right over here. Look at what we've got. Oh, this is it. Yes. (Cobra laughs) This is definitely it. (device beeping) We're gonna need some help with this. Doc and Willow should be here soon. - You wanna go for that swim? - Yeah. - All right, sounds good. (mysterious music) (tense music) - Ava, I see Savage Beach. We're there. (lever clicking) (radar beeping) (machinery whirring) - Yes. Let's go. - I love women in leather. You smell like a new car. - Too bad you'll never get a test drive. - [Doc] There they are, Willow. - I am so glad we found you. - We think we've located where the treasure is. - Yeah, looks like we're gonna need some help digging it up, big guy. - Let's do it. (tense music) Here it is, the Philippine treasure. - [Sofia] Spread out! (men grunting) (tense music) (gunshot bangs) (Tyler groaning) (gunshots banging) - [Man] No! (device beeping) (explosions booming) - Yeah. (somber music) (tense music) (gunshots banging) (motor whirring) (device beeping) (explosions booming) (Cobra laughing) (tense music) (man grunting) - [Willow] Doc, look out! (gunshots banging) (man grunting) - Allow me. I'm Sofia Menz, Interpol agent, M1772 Berlin district. We've been onto these people for two years. Look, thank god the bullet hit Tyler's medallion, but he's hurt badly. Help me! (somber music) - Whoa! That really hurt. I was shot, right'? Where? - [Willow] Your medaallion. - Okay- Okay. You ladies wanna help me up'? (alarm blaring) - [Woman] Attention, this countdown is less than two minutes. The gold Martinez medallion must be inserted into the trigger device and the coordinates lined up, or everything within a two-mile radius will be destroyed. Dangen - Give me the medallion. - [Woman] Mayday, mayday, approaching a catastrophic code red situation. Attention, danger-- - [Willow] It's ticking, come on. It must fit. - [Woman] Radiation kill factor 100%. Mayday, danger, the atomic device fail-safe system has been violated. - Come on, file it down. - Let me see the file. - Right here. - Here, file this. - Attention, imminent danger. 45 seconds to explosion. - Come on, girl. - [Cobra] Oh my god - [Woman] Follow instructions as given. Urgent, urgent, all things alive, persons or creatures, should not be within 16 square miles of this ground zero point. Attention, mayday situation. 30 seconds. Medallion insertion required. - [Willow] Just a little more. - [Woman] No other termination of countdown possible. - Try it now. - [Woman] Evacuation probability less than 100th of 1%. Closing in to point of no return. 15 seconds to explosion. - 15 seconds left, come on. - [Woman] 10 seconds and counting. Nine, eight-- - Try it again, try it again. - There you go. - Six, five, four-- ' Yes! (all cheering) - Thank god. - [Woman] Countdown terminated. Trigger device neutralized at four seconds and holding. - [Tyler] That was close. - Wonderful. - Look at all that. - This beauty. Oh, it's so heavy. It's gotta be worth a fortune. - That's a priceless Buddha. - You know, we have had some good luck. We might wanna rub its belly. - Yeah, I'll say. That was close. - All right. (gentle eastern music) - Are you having a fantasy again? What is it? (upbeat rock music) Bad boy. Baby, you're tough Baby, you're smart The lovin' that you could serve Would tear my heart apart You got the look You got the power You got the stuff to make the me stand up and holler Make me your prisoner Your prisoner of love Yeah, I'm down on my knees l'm begging, baby, please Make me your prisoner Your prisoner of love (upbeat rock music) HI take the sentence l did the crime Whatever you dish out HI serve the time l'm on my best behavior l'm hoping for parole HI try my hardest To satisfy your soul Cause I'm your prisoner Your prisoner of love l'm down on my knees, I'm begging, baby please Make me your prisoner Your prisoner of love l'm down on my knees, I'm begging, baby please Make me your prisoner Your prisoner of love (Cobra laughing) (tense music) (serene music) - [Tyler] Nice boat. - This is a private dock, sir. - Don't even breathe. Where's Martinez? - Suite 55. - We're at the yacht, ladies. Come on down. - You've got 10 minutes with him, sweetheart. If you're not out by then, we're coming in. (soft jazz music) - [Rodrigo] Ah, my lovely Sofia, please, come in. (door buzzing) - Here it is, my dear. The priceless gold Buddha. Our mission was a success. (glasses clink) (gun clicks) (Sofia gasping) - We're not waiting any longer. Doc, you and Tyler get the local cops to pick that guy up. You ladies are coming with me. We'll stay in radio contact. - Let's go. - Damn. Welcome, ladies. The door is open. Please join me. May I offer you a glass of champagne? - Hell no, you bastard. You're under arrest. - For what, smoking in public? The treasures you see here are to be returned to the people of the Philippines. I believe they were found by you and your Interpol agent friend, Sofia. - You knew this? - [Rodrigo] Of course. - I'd love that glass of champagne, if I could fix you one as well. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - [Rodrigo] I don't mean to sound arrogant, but if you think Sofia is the heroine in this scenario, and I am the criminal, I must correct you. - [Willow] We saw her on her way up here, and she had the gold Buddha with her. - [Rodrigo] This is true. - Well where is she now? - She dropped off this Buddha filled with jewels and left from the side door. As you can see, she took a few items with her for her troubles. She may be an Interpol agent, but she was afflicted with a large dose of greed. Please, relax. I have much to tell you. - Would you excuse me for a moment? - Certainly. I know you're aware of how I came to be here. Almost 10 years ago, I was involved with the discovery of the Philippine international gold reserves the Japanese had confiscated during World War ll. (somber music) The gold was worth billions. It was taken to an uncharted island now known as Savage Beach. - Have you got my lali>t0l9? - I put it aboard for you. - I think you guys should go to Martinez's suite and join the others. We've got a real mystery here. - When we found the treasure, I was planning to double-cross the Philippine government and keep these riches for myself. But instead, I was double-crossed by my own soldiers. (gunshot bangs) (woman shouting) I ran for safety during a big shootout between those of us who were thieves against Donna Hamilton, Taryn Kendall, and other federal agents. It was bloody. (man groaning) - Let's get outta here. (gunshots banging) - Get him! - Greetings, gentlemen. I managed to make it to a small rubber boat, but Taryn, who had the first crossbow weapon with an explosive tipped arrow, how do you say in English? (speaking foreign language) - Blew your ass off. (Rodrigo laughing) - Yes. (chuckles) Blew my ass off. (gunshots banging) (somber music) (device beeping) (explosion booming) Later, when they came back to the site, no one could find my body, so they assumed I was dead. But I had been trained by the US Army Rangers. I was one tough son of a bitch then. After the explosion, I swam underwater for 50 yards, then I climbed ashore and licked my wounds. (Rodrigo groaning) (water splashing) I managed to survive and get my strength back, and so later, I began to work on the damaged Molokai cargo plane. I used the tools and the gasoline from the Japanese boat which had been wrecked on the island 40 years before. It took weeks, but finally it was done. I recorded everything in my diary. Then, miraculously... Plane start, it worked. (Rodrigo laughing) (airplane engine roaring) I took off, 15 hours later, landed in Hawaii, on an abandoned airstrip on the north shore of Oahu. I received temporary medical help from my friends in Honolulu, then I was smuggled back to the Philippines. I had 12 operations over the next six years to repair the wounds to my body and my face. Iam still badly scarred on this side, therefore the mask. Soon after my operations, I was contacted by corrupt politicians who were stealing the Philippines' national treasures. The nation's gold reserves, jewels, precious stones, and a priceless Buddha filled with diamonds. I convinced these people that I should lead an expedition to the uncharted Savage Island for safekeeping of the treasures. After we did this, I disappeared. No one could find me. (somber music) I made a pledge to myself as a gesture of restitution for my past transgressions. I vowed to return these treasures to the people of the Philippines when the corrupt politicians were no longer in power. Then, a few years ago, my body began to fail me. The damage from the explosion years earlier put a hold on my heart. I thought I was about to die before I could complete my mission to make amends for my past. That is when I sent the diary, the medallion, and the concealed disc to Tyler's father. If I died, the diary and the disc would reveal the secrets of the hidden treasure to you, Tyler, and to the LETHAL Force. - But you survived, and you sent your killing force to eliminate us, and get the treasure for yourself. - Its seems that way on the surface, yes. I sent men to you, yes. However, they were criminals working for these scum politicians. Once they got the treasure, they would've killed me and taken the loot for themselves. I even thought the lovely Sofia was my ally, but alas, she turned out to be an Interpol spy working for M1. A female James Bond who loved money more than honor. (Sofia murmuring) - Freeze. - [Cobra] It's Sofia! She's been hurt! (tense music) - Time to reveal yourself, Martinez. Tyler, he was your father's friend. You do the honors. (mysterious music) What? - Wait, I have something. Doc, hold him. (mysterious music) (agents gasping) - [Sofia] I don't believe it. - [Doc] It's Carlos, Rodrigo Martinez's nephew. - He's been on lnterpol's most wanted list for the past two years. (gentle eastern music) (tense music) - Another LETHAL Force victory. The treasure has been returned to the Philippine people. - And Carlos has been turned over to the Philippine government. - Martinez really had changed his ways, but his nephew murdered him and took his identity. - Who would've believed it? - Yeah, we almost fell for it. (agents chuckling) - And you, Tiger, sending that fax of Carlos Prince to Washington. What a brilliant stroke. - Tyler, you've gotta start thinking of me as more than just a pretty face. - I'll work on that. (agents laughing) (tense music) (agents laughing) - Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Rodrigo Martinez. - But you're dead. You were killed by your nephew Carlos. - How many endings can this story have'? - Yes, Carlos shot me four times. Bulletproof vest, Teflon, shattered my spleen, broke four ribs, I was unconscious for three days. - You're one hell of a survivor. - I'm a walking testament to modern medical science. I feel as though we've met in another life. - What a line. - It's working. - You two could really boogie. - I prefer the tango. - You would. - This is Ava, your KSXY sextrologist. I'm here in Molokai, Hawaii, next to my hot tub with my engineering genius, Harry the Cat, and a couple of friends. Remember, all good things come to those who have patience and love. - Just think, I got to take out a couple of guys and got rewarded for it. (agents chuckling) - You play your cards right, and you'll have more rewards than you can handle. - Ooh, I'll drink to that. - We'll all drink to that.
