-VIVE BONAPARTE! VIVE BONAPARTE! VIVE BONAPARTE! Cheers. - This is General Bonaparte. He is the youngest and most famous general in Europe. In a month, he crossed the Grand-Saint-Bernard pass and defeated the Austrian army. Already, he conquered all the Milanese. Bonaparte wants to pursue the Austrians in the plain of the Po, and if necessary, until Vienna. To give heart to his troops, he will read them a proclamation of which he has the secret. Soldiers, you are naked, malnourished. The government owes you a lot. He... not... -Hey ! Hurry, they will notice us. - Fuck them! - Fuck you too. -And the 100 pistoles that I won for you in Milan? -And the girl you stole from me in Paris? -Oh yeah. You are an infantry dog. And the one you stole from me in Como? -That was so funny. Shut up that day! -What's yours now? -You will find honor, glory and wealth. Soldiers of Italy, would you lack courage? -The bastards. -VIVE BONAPARTE! Cheers. -Hey, monkey! It's wet, your rum. - "Wet '", my rum? -Me, I would say that it is soaked. -I said: "wet." -And I said: "soaked." -I said: "wet." -Fixed ! Dorgeval, Duprat, citizen captains, what were you doing during the general's proclamation? -We were fighting, Colonel. -As usual, Colonel. Laughs. -Dorgeval! Duprat! Finally, what's going on? -Band of cows! -lis discovered that La Cantinière was putting water in her rum. It is punished according to the tradition of the French army. -Are you sure the idea didn't come from you? - Oh, my colonel... - Battalion! -Mr. the count is angry. He is waiting for you to leave. Precisely, I don't want to leave. -The French are coming! -The French are arriving, and I am leaving. But the Austrians will come back. -The Austrian army has always protected us. Mademoiselle, the French are coming. -Just enough, I have had enough of the Austrians! ♪ wait for the French. They will entertain me. -Carlotta, we are going to fall into the hands of the French. -Do not come in, I'm in my bath. -Your grandfather orders you. You will dress in the car. -No. I'm waiting for the French! -Good people, get out of your houses. Colonel Lafont will talk to you about the freedom that the armies of the Republic bring you. -In my opinion, they don't want to hear about freedom. 'Are we going to see. Soldiers, get them out. - Let's go. -Shit! -Tell me yes. -I do all trades, but my vocation is love. You won't regret trying me. -OK. At midnight. -Good. Good. Next time, I'll cut you in half. -Here they are. -How many are they ? -Of them. - Do the same. -At your command. -They are funny. And then they are beautiful. The blond... Brown is also not bad. -Look at this. That turns my blood on. I bet I hit him right in the heart. Duprat laughed. -Oh no ! -Did you see that ? Do better if you can. -Looked ice. -Oh no ! - I'll cut the cord. And me, without aiming. Dorgeval laughs. -Oh no ! -Hey, are there people? -Is there is a crowd ? -Hello, gentlemen. -The supper will be served soon. - Is there is a crowd. -And they are two. Ah, I'm enjoying it. It is a genius idea to have come to this castle. -I was the one who had the idea. You followed. -I got the idea first. You simply formulated it on the 1st. Oh, say so! -Well then... There is three. - Where have you been? We haven't seen you. - I went to get wine in the cellar. -What is your name ? -Carlotta. -Well, Carlotta, do you want me to tell you? -You are adorable. -But you don't know how to serve wine. -Dorgeval will teach you. -To start, sit there. -No, I wouldn't dare. -Dare then. Dare! Now you are a free citizen. You are free to sit on my lap. -Oh, but since she is free, she has the right to refuse your knees and sit on mine. And that's the Republic. -Wood, wood. -No no no. -No, she's free. She can choose to refuse your drink and drink from mine. -You are a free woman. -I am not thirsty. -A free woman must be thirsty for wine and love. -But love, yes. And long live the Republic! -Long live the Republic... and long live Italy! The castle is too small for two. There is one too many. -Yes. -Ho! Ho! Hey, Cantinière! Where are you, pretty Cantinière? Corn... Oh, I won on the exchange. There are two. -My captain ? My captain ? My captain ? My captain ? But... But that's my course... Oh, and then the other cap... Oh! But what... What does that mean? Here, we're sure they won't escape. Then... So do we leave them there or throw them in the hole? We'll start with that one. We know him less. Go for it. We just have to push them. -Yes. -Yes. -But yes. We put them all to the edge, and when they wake up, they will fall on their own. Let's go. -Do you think they've already fallen into the hole? -And if they fall, they won't risk dying? -You annoys me; with all your questions. -Bells... ♪ hear... bells in... in my head. He yells. But but... Mas... Mas... Mas... There's a... There's a ... There is a hole. -My... my captain! -What ? - I still had pot, this manure. -Hey ! Hey! -Good idea you had. It is cute, your castle. -You had it before me. -It's a miracle that we're not all at the bottom of the hole. Drunkard! -The wine was a drug. Drunk yourself. -Instead of yelling at you... -Let's try to get it out of this hole. - Let him die! -Oh, I'll get by myself. Old cow! -Take. Catch if you can. -You can't take it down a bit more, can you? -No. - Damn the bastard. -It... it pulls me on... on the arms. It pulls me on my legs. -Was it good downstairs? -My... Captain, we... we must... -The bitches! -It starts well, the war. We already have 4 prisoners. It's wonderful not to be bored anymore. - Where are they? Where are these bitches? Laughs. -This way ! -Thank you, they are alive. -They will surely rape us. - Kill us, yes. After what we did to them... -The bitches! -I see one there! -And one up there! -Little bitch. You will hear from me. -Help ! Help ! -Wait a bit for me to catch you. Miss, help! Help ! -"Miss" ? So it was Carlotta, the boss. -We'll find you, bitch. And it will be your birthday. -She is not there. I saw her, I'm sure. -It's not the first time. You must have had a blast again. -Do not fuck with me, this is not the time. -I'll laugh at you as long as I like it. Carlotta screams. - Sergeant ? -You... you are my prisoner of war. - You're going to pay us for it. Carlotta laughed. -I have it. -Me too. - I won't let go. -Oh, bugger de corniaud. - You fuck-jeans. -I surrender. Now I am a prisoner of war. -You tried to kill us. You will be shot. -Mr Captain, it is not customary to shoot a prisoner. -We will create it, use it. -You have no orders to give here. -To be a prisoner, she would have to wear a uniform. Do you call that a uniform? - You don't you like my uniform? -Hey ! Whistling. - I who have done all the trades, I have pot today. -Me me too. -This young girl will be judged by the council of war. We'll give it to the colonel. On the way. -But my... my captain... -You shut up. -But where did the battalion go? -But, my captain, that was what I had come to tell you. That the regiment set out again because of the counterattack of... Austrians. ♪ had come to tell you... And you answered me: "Fe .. Fe... "Shut up." -God forgive me. These animals intend to shake our plume. -These filthy French people have a grudge against Miss Carlotta. We must not let us do it. Onward, deliver it! -When you don't know how to ride a horse, you fall. -Go ahead, drop it from there! - Take them alive. They are my prisoners. Drum. -The French ! The French ! Leave them ! The French are coming back. Hide ! Get back to your homes quickly. -Oh shit ! Come on, quickly, let's hide. Keep playing. Where is the battalion? -he's not here anymore ? -What are you doing here ? -I was practicing in the woods so as not to disturb. -You will tell us about your life later. -Come on, let's go. Left. Left. Left... -And Carlotta? -We do not care. -She speaks Italian and she knows the country. She could help us. -You're an asshole. -And you, a deserter. -Play ! The bitch, there she is! -Carlotta! -Carlotta! Slut. Bitch! - Funny, isn't it? -You're going to explain to us why, you bitch. - Do you take us for puppets? -The Aut... The Aut... -Go quickly ! Everyone in the car. Come on, on the way. -The Aut... The Aut... -What do you have in there? -Old stuff. Garbage, what. -That's all ? And where are you going like that? -Where you want, handsome officer. -How nice. Don't go behind the hills. The French are there. -See you later. -Bye. Good road. Forward! Explain to me why you didn't deliver us. -Because you are more fun than the Austrians. Lead us to our battalion behind the hills. -Why did you try to kill us? -Because I was bored. -Oh shit. Corn... She doesn't give a damn about us. Get this in your head: all we want from you is to find the battalion. -If you fought, it's because of me, anyway. -No, but listen to her. And that's all. -Faster. And then stop your charm. It takes more. Huh, guys? -If there weren't the Austrians, well, ah there! She's crying. -Halte! -HALT! -Ah, the beautiful chick! -My captain. -But it's... "Cabrol and Pastagnac," said the Aristo. -If I had known that this vehicle was yours, I would never have allowed myself. -Neither am I. -But what are you doing here? -And you ? -We lost the ba... -We too. We bivouacked 'on the other side' and... -And you lost your regiment. You are deserters, good for the council of war. -You too. -How? 'Or' What ? -Ah, well... yes. Yes, U.S. too. Our regiment is only a few leagues ahead. At noon, we will have joined him. Everyone in the car. But she's gone! - Did you find a creature? -Yes, and we lost it. -And Silvio, where is he? - Well you have to find her before she denounces us... -To Others... -It will be your fault. -Eh ? Why not yours? Carlotta laughed. -You're not ashamed to panic this kid? -You could be his mother. -Don't overdo it. Excuse these gentlemen... -And you two, aren't you ashamed? - Ashamed of what? -Well, to be jealous of this kid. -I am thirsty. -Ask others to help you. -Not worth it. -Ah. -Corn... -A bi... bi... A bi... bi... -A bivouac. -The fires are still hot. I, who made all... -The army! Let's go. -The bullies! The brutes, with their army... Ah, men... So I don't count anymore? I don't count anymore, eh? We'll see. It's a smoke. -Advance ! -We hear the cannon. -No, it's a storm. -You'll see. -In a few hours... -We joined them. Tonight, we eat as usual. All by car. Now it's going down. Carlotta, in the car. -So you're coming ? -No ! -I... I'm going down. -Stay here, you'll kill yourself. We will put the sabers in the wheels. -Yours. -Thanks my God. They are alive. We will be able to continue having fun. -Oh ! The ca... The ca... The cart! -Hey ! Hey! Go on ! To find the regiment... Ah, the bitch! -That's saying something. -Come on, hop! Where is she? -The bitch... -Here she is! -You'll see, dirty bitch! -Thumb ! Thumb ! I do not play anymore. I hurt myself too much. -Send us to the ravine, you call that playing? -It's not me who harnessed the horses. -No kidding. -No, no, it's me. And the blow of oblivion, it is not you, perhaps? -You always talk about the past. You always accuse me, while I am doing so badly. - Are you in pain? Or'? Or'? -All over. -We are not going to be moved by a girl who tried to kill us. - Do you not like me? Not at all ? -We promised you that one day it would be your birthday. That day has arrived '. -Oh no, not you. You are so nice... - I did all the trades, even captive with the Turks. Over there, when a caliph's mousme was at fault ', it was given to slaves to have fun with. - Come on, gentlemen, you do not think about it. Though... -We gave it to... to... Oh!

To destroy the 25th of the line. -Our regiment. -Where is the ambush? -It does not say it. "The artillery will be concealed above the bank." - We must discover the location of the ambush. -Let's go to Cento. -Yes, that's the only solution. -Cento is a stronghold built by Count Sforza... -Ho! It's okay, the Aristo! - They just have to put on their clothes. -Me, in Aut... never! -Is it true, this ambush story?

I don't care, your friends. -Except Dorgeval. -Listen... The moment is too serious. -I need your advice. -Here then. -We must save the regiment. You have to put yourself in Austrians and enter Cento. -Not all. Only one of us. -Be a prisoner of the Austrians, even for laughs, it doesn't make me laugh. -I can flank him -No. a spanking? -Yes. In Cento. -The jump... -Carlotta... -Watch your ears. -Halte. Where are you taking these prisoners? In Cento? You seem to me very young to be already a lieutenant. -It is because I shaved clean this morning. I have a twin sister, my captain. My mother always dressed us as girls, both of us. -Disturbing. ♪ have kept some habits. -I could introduce you to my twin sister. She's due to come join me at Cento these days. -So to Cento, lieutenant. I can't wait to interrogate these prisoners. Walk. Ah... Would you mind taking two of the prisoners? -Not at all. Which ? -The first... -Por... for... why me? -And the one who is at the end. -The bitch! -No. Let us first think of the battalion. We'll settle the accounts after. - That will teach him. -Get down. Come down! Take care of yourself. As in the cavalry. -I have the passion to train horses. -I have done all the trades, and dressage, that knows me.

Hey! -Ah, if I had a weapon, what a beautiful fireworks display... -As on July 14? -These firecrackers are intended for our friends in the 25th line. We know where the powder keg is. We have to get out of there as quickly as possible. -Corn... -The car. Shoot, I'm telling you. Drawn ! Everything is rotten here.

Does he have such a thin nose and such an arched foot? - Indeed, indeed. speaking German Your brother had boots. We could not judge the smoothness of the foot. -And of course he was wearing a well-fitting dolman. He thinks he's a girl. And even... -No ? But you are Italian.

Go with the others. French ! At my command, fire at will! Warning... Fire ! -I got you a short head. Cries of panic. If we took advantage of it? -Population of Cento, this is the vanguard of the French army. Go home quietly. The French who surround us came here as liberators, not torturers. -It is... It's... It's the warrior's rest. -Long live the Republic ! Long live the Republic ! -The Republic, eh? -No, no, don't argue. There will be some for everyone. -Carlotta ditched us. It is your fault. -Without your idea of ​​a castle, we wouldn't have had a Carlotta. -I can't believe she's gone. You who thought you were irresistible... Ah, my poor old man. Seduce and give up '. -You are afraid that she denounced us to the Austrian army. -She's just tired of seeing you, and I understand her. Ah, I understand her. -No it's you. You disgusted her.

They only think about fighting. -I'm going to make you swallow my sword. - I'll make you digest mine. -No ! - It is no longer a woman for me, citizen captain. For you, maybe. You served the aristocrats. Sneers. -And the information you should have, do you have it? And the regiment? What about your comrades? Do you think about it?

I recognize the drum of the 25th of the line. -So, can you see? the French army is here. Your ambush doesn't hold up anymore. It is out of curiosity that we ask you where these morons are waiting for a regiment that is in Cento. -If I had been listened to ', we would not have sent all our forces to the Saint-Bernard Bridge. -Thank you, colonel. You're really nice. Orders in German. -They will be executed tomorrow morning. -Farewell, Carlotta. -I did all the trades, but... -You had never been tied to a ring. -No. How do you know ? -You think she liked me a little, Carlotta? -Ah, the chicks. -I said they would end up having us, the jump... -Duprat, I'll take you... -Yes, I know. -Dorgeval... -He? -Je t'emm... -Yes, I know.

We do not have the time. -Now we know the way. -But it was I who saved your life in Cento. -You have tried so often to kill us. Remember : the dungeons, the cart... - Go home, little one. - "Small" ? Did you say "small"? "Small" ? -Come on, come on. Come on. -Carlotta! Carlotta screams. -Duprat, do you want to stay here! Stay here, all of you. Thousands of people depend on us. Duprat! I beg you. But stay there. Duprat! Carlotta screams. -It is your fault. -You had to not be so crude. -It's not the moment. -You have a pretty heart? And the friends of the Pont Saint-Bernard? Would you sacrifice the French army for a girl? -We have time to save her. - I'll leave it to you. Love to you. -And you have the beautiful chocolate medals, asshole soldier. Stupid by the stripes, saber trader. Carlotta screams. - Come on, gentlemen. Let me remind you that Carlotta is in danger. -I go. -I'm going. -What 7 - You're not going to start over. Let's go.

We are deserters. -So we will be fu... shot? - I have a way. - I have another one. And better. -The contrary would have stunned me'. -You... you who have done all the trades, is it that... -I have never had the Austrians on one side and the French on the other. -I am right. -You are wrong. -In any case, we agree on one point. -We need everyone, except Latouche. - I will go to warn the French army. -But they are going to fu... shoot me. -No. -Do you prefer the Austrians? No no. -And me ? Can I be used for something? -My co... My co... -What ? -The Aut... The Aut... They are there. -Your name ? -Latouche, Duprat company. -Duprat and Dorgeval? The deserters?

Forward! Don't look, she's not here. -You're terminal. -I know. -My daughter, in the hands of these bandits... Your suffering must have been excruciating. -Oh, worse than that. I was burned, beaten, tortured, tied up, troussée... -Oh, my God. Clamor. -There are the French. -Lord! Follow us, the coaches are waiting at the south gate. -Yes, my grandfather. -My friends, you saved the regiment. General Bonaparte is happy with you. Unfortunately, the Legion of Honor does not yet exist, nor does the military medal, and even less the Croix de Guerre. But the general still wanted to do something for you. The traffic jams are popping. -The Aut... The Aut... -Too late. -Oh no ! Do not fight any more. -Now, Mondovi, Montenotte, Marengo... -What... What are we going to put on them, the Austrians. Pan! Pan! -Go ahead.- Go ahead, I'm telling you. -I have no orders to receive from you. -Yes. I am the oldest in the rank. - Fuck you. -Me too. -A glass of rum, pretty Cantinière. But it's wet, your rum. -Wet ', my rum? Take. -Do you know what we did at the last Cantinière? We stripped her naked. -I know. I do not care. I'm used to it.
