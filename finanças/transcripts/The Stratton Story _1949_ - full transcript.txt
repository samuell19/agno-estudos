GREAT GAME, MONTY. THANK YOU, MR. HIGGINS. THAT'S IT FOR THIS YEAR. SEE YOU NEXT SEASON? SURE, I'LL BE THERE. SO LONG. NICE GAME YOU PITCHED TODAY. THANKS, MISTER. YOU EVER THINK OF PITCHING REGULAR PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL? THAT'S ALL I EVER DO THINK ABOUT. WHAT ARE YOU WASTING YOUR TIME HERE FOR? I GET $3.00 EVERY TIME I PITCH A GAME. I THINK YOU AND I OUGHT TO TALK. I'D LIKE TO, BUT I GOT TO GET GOING. WHERE YOU HEADING? HOME. OK IF I TROT ALONG? SURE, SURE, IF YOU'D LIKE. SAY, BOY, WHERE IS YOUR HOME, ANYWAY? ABOUT 4 MILES UP THIS ROAD. WELL, CAN'T WE HITCH A RIDE OR SOMETHING? IT MIGHT BE AN HOUR BEFORE A CAR COMES ALONG. WELL, I CAN WAIT. HAPPY. HI, MA. HOW'S MY GIRL? YOU BEEN PLAYING BALL AGAIN? SURE HAVE. ONLY GAVE THEM FOUR HITS. FINE WAY FOR THE MAN OF THE FAMILY TO BE SPENDING TIME. I HAD TIME TO KILL TODAY. DID ALL THE CHORES BEFORE I LEFT. I STILL GOT TIME TO PICK A LITTLE COTTON. HEY... YOU GOT A NICE PROFIT IN A DAY. HOW DO YOU DO, MADAM? I... I GUESS YOU MUST BE MONTY'S MA. YEAH. I'M BARNEY WILE. MONTY AROUND? HE'S OUT PICKING COTTON. YOU MEAN AFTER SPRINTING 10 MILES AND PITCHING NINE INNINGS, HE'S PICKING COTTON? YEAH. HE MUST WANT TO PLAY BASEBALL AWFUL BAD. ALL HE THINKS ABOUT IS THROWING A BALL. WELL, I DON'T WONDER, MADAM. HE CAN TRANSFORM A BASEBALL INTO A STREAK OF GRAY LIGHTNING AND CURVE IT IN LIKE IT WAS WEAVING THROUGH TRAFFIC. I'D SAY HE'S GOT A GREAT FUTURE IN BASEBALL. YOU A BASEBALL MAN? YES, MA'AM. THEN I'D SAY HE'S GOT A BETTER FUTURE ON THE FARM. HEY! HEY! HEY! COME HERE! OH, HI. WHAT, YOU GET A LIFT? YEAH, PART WAY. THAT'S QUITE A JAUNT. I'M ALL FAGGED OUT. GUESS YOU'RE NOT IN VERY GOOD SHAPE, HUH? WELL, I HAVEN'T BEEN IN TRAINING FOR A MARATHON. YOU WALK UP THERE AND BACK EVERY TIME YOU PITCH? YEAH. SEE, THE WALK UP, IT SORT OF GETS MY MUSCLES NICE AND LOOSE, AND THE WALK BACK KEEPS THEM FROM TIGHTENING UP. WORKS THEM OUT PRETTY GOOD. YEAH. I NEVER THOUGHT OF THAT. BUT ABOUT YOUR PITCHING, LIKE I WAS SAYING, YOU GOT A NICE, EASY MOTION. I GUESS YOU DIDN'T WALK ALL THE WAY HERE JUST TO TELL ME YOU LIKE THE WAY I THROW. OF COURSE YOU'RE A LITTLE RAGGED YET AND YOU NEED SOME SMOOTHING OUT, BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'LL GIVE US MUCH TROUBLE. EVER PLAY ANY BALL? I'VE HAD MY INNINGS. WHERE? OH, CHICAGO, CLEVELAND, BOSTON. I'VE BEEN AROUND. HIT THE BIG LEAGUES? UH-HUH. WHAT'D YOU PLAY? BEHIND THE BAT. YOU WERE A CATCHER, HUH? I CAUGHT ALL THE BIG FELLAS. WELL... WELL... OH, I KNOW. I... I WAS A FOOL. I... A GRAND-SLAM, DOUBLE-BARRELED FOOL. BREAKING TRAINING AND HITTING THE BOTTLE, YOU DON'T STAY UP THERE VERY LONG. BY THE TIME I LEARNED MY LESSON, I WAS OUT. AND IT ISN'T SO EASY TO GET BACK IN. BUT WHEN I SAW YOU, I WAS SEEING A DREAM COME TRUE... MY DREAM OF FINDING A HOT PROSPECT AND COMING BACK INTO BASEBALL. I SURE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU. IT'S STILL LIGHT. YOU WANT TO CATCH A FEW? WELL, MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH EXERCISE FOR ONE DAY, BUT I HAVE. BUT, UH... WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO WORK OUT TOMORROW. WHAT, ARE YOU STAYING AROUND HERE? WELL... NOT EXACTLY. OH, YOU JUST PASSING THROUGH, HUH? YES, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I'M ON MY WAY TO CALIFORNIA. OH. OF COURSE, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE CALIFORNIA. I, UH... I COULD... I... I... I MIGHT... I... I... I COULD HELP... YOU EVER DO ANY FARM WORK? OH, I'VE... I'VE... I'VE... I'VE... YOU LOOK KIND OF FLABBY. OH, SON, I'VE GOT MUSCLES I HAVEN'T EVEN USED YET. UH-HUH. YOU, UH... YOU MEET MY MOTHER? YEAH. I STRUCK OUT. OH, THAT FIGURED. WELL... I GUESS THIS IS WHAT US BASEBALL MEN WOULD CALL A SQUEEZE PLAY. MAY I OFFER MY COMPLIMENTS, MRS. STRATTON? THIS WAS A MEAL FIT FOR KINGS. AND THIS PIE... NOTHING LIKE THE PIE MOTHER USED TO MAKE. IS THAT SO? NO. MY MOTHER COULDN'T BOIL WATER. YOU DON'T SAY? MR. WILE HERE, HE'S SORT OF LOOKING AROUND FOR SOMETHING TO DO. I THOUGHT MAYBE HE COULD SORT OF HOLE UP HERE FOR THE WINTER AND HELP OUT AROUND THE PLACE. YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO, MONTY, WE CAN'T AFFORD NO HIRED HAND. OH, WELL, HE WOULDN'T EXPECT ANY PAY. UH, JUST ROOM AND KEEP. I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE SO OVERWORKED YOU NEEDED HELP. NO, NO, IT'S... NOT THAT, MA. IT'S JUST THAT A LOT OF THINGS NEED DOING. MR. WILE COULD BE MIGHTY HANDY WITH, UH, FIXING THAT FENCE DOWN AT THE PIGPEN, FIXING THE ROOF ON THE CHICKEN COOP, PULLING THOSE STUMPS DOWN BY THE CRICK. OH, WE'D GET THIS PLACE IN REAL FINE SHAPE. WHEN YOUR PAPA DIED, HE LEFT THIS PLACE TO YOU, MONTY. YOU'RE THE MAN OF THE HOUSE. IF YOU WANT MR. WILE AROUND, I AIN'T GOING TO RAISE A FUSS. YOU OUGHT TO BE OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. WELL... SAY, YOU KNOW, SOMEHOW I FEEL SORT OF TIRED. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY. WHAT DO YOU SAY WE TURN IN, BARNEY? GOOD NIGHT, MOTHER. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT, MA'AM, AND THANK YOU. THIS FARM'S ALL MONTY'S GOT, MR. WILE, BUT IT'S WORTH SOMETHING. THE LAND ALWAYS IS IF YOU LOOK AFTER IT. BUT YOU AND MONTY, YOU GO AHEAD AND TALK BASEBALL, AND MAYBE SOMEDAY HE'LL DO AS GOOD AS YOU DID. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE, SON. WAIT A MINUTE. WHEN YOU SWING BACK, YOU PIVOT AROUND LIKE THIS. BUT DON'T TRY TO STRIKE OUT EVERY BATTER. USE YOUR CONTROL AND LET YOUR FIELDERS HELP YOU. AND AS YOU COME FORWARD, USE YOUR BODY. FOLLOW THROUGH! I GUESS IN A SPOT LIKE THAT, THE BEST PITCH WOULD BE... NICE AND EASY. NOW FOLLOW THROUGH, NICE AND EASY. THAT'S IT, BOY! THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. AND ALWAYS, ALWAYS COVER FIRST BASE WHEN THE BALL'S HIT DEEP. NICE PITCH, BOY. NICE PITCH. NOW, LET ME LOOK AT THE CURVE BALL. AW, GOOD HOOK. GOOD HOOK! HEH HEH. NOW, LET ME SEE THE BIG ONE. WELL, THAT'S IT FOR THE DAY. GET YOUR COAT ON, SON. KEEP THAT ARM WARM. WELL, YOU'RE READY. AW, YOU'RE JOKING. NAW, I'VE TAUGHT YOU ALL I KNOW. THE REST YOU GOT TO FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF. NOW WE GOT TO GET YOU SOME ACTION. NOT MUCH ACTION AROUND HERE. OH, BUT THERE IS IN CALIFORNIA. JIMMY DYKES AND THE WHITE SOX ARE STARTING THEIR SPRING TRAINING THERE NEXT WEEK. CHICAGO WHITE SOX? YEAH! JIMMY DYKES IS AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE. I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR 20 YEARS. ALL I HAVE TO DO IS SAY THE WORD AND HE'LL GIVE YOU A TRYOUT. HE WILL? SURE! OUT IN CALIFORNIA? YEAH. LOOKS LIKE WE GOT ANOTHER SQUEEZE PLAY COMING UP. YEAH. BARNEY AND I ARE SORT OF THINKING ABOUT TAKING A LITTLE TRIP OUT TO CALIFORNIA. THAT SO? WHAT BASEBALL TEAM'S OVER THERE? UH, IT'S THE WHITE SOX. HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT? I DIDN'T RECKON YOU'D BE GOING OVER THERE FOR ANYTHING IMPORTANT. BUT THIS IS IMPORTANT, MA'AM. WORTH GIVING UP THE FARM FOR? IF THEY TAKE HIM ON, THE LEAST HE'LL GET IS 300 A MONTH. POWERFUL LOT OF MONEY FOR JUST THROWING A BALL. AND MONTY WON'T HAVE TO GIVE UP THE FARM WHILE HE'S TRYING OUT. COUSIN EARNIE SAID HE'D TAKE CARE OF IT FOR ME. THAT 300 A MONTH... THAT'LL BUY A LOT OF STUFF WE NEED. WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE THEY'LL GIVE YOU A TRYOUT? THEY TRY JUST ANYBODY? WELL, THEY SURE DON'T! BARNEY AND JIMMY DYKES ARE OLD FRIENDS. WHO? JIMMY DYKES. HE'S THE MANAGER OF THE BALL TEAM. THAT WAY I'LL GET A CHANCE FOR SURE. LAND'S THE ONLY PLACE WHERE YOU'RE SURE. LOTS OF PEOPLE DON'T LIVE ON FARMS, MA'AM. LOTS OF PEOPLE DON'T EAT REGULAR, TOO. YOU, UH... YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND, AIN'T YOU, SON? I JUST GOT TO GIVE IT A TRY, MOTHER. HOW YOU FELLOWS FIGURING ON GETTING ALONG? OH, DON'T WORRY! WE'LL MAKE OUT ALL RIGHT, WON'T WE, BARNEY? WELL, OF COURSE, THEY DON'T PAY YOU WHILE YOU'RE TRYING OUT. BUT THAT WON'T BE ANY PROBLEM OR ANYTHING. I DON'T THINK YOU OUGHT TO DISCOURAGE CONTRIBUTIONS, SON. CONTRIBUTIONS? WE'RE LUCKY TO BE GOING. WELL... HERE, SON. HERE'S $5.00 I SAVED FROM SELLING THAT CALF. IT'S ALL YOU GET. THANK YOU, MOTHER. AND DON'T YOU WORRY, MRS. STRATTON. I'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM. LET HIM TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF. GOOD NIGHT, SON.

OH, NO, NO, JIMMY, I HAVEN'T HAD A DROP SINCE I FIRST SAW THE BOY. LISTEN, SON. BARNEY'S PROBABLY FILLED YOUR HEAD WITH A LOT OF COCKEYED IDEAS. BUT I CAN'T WASTE TIME WITH EVERY KID HE DIGS UP. YOU MR. DYKES? THAT'S RIGHT. JIMMY, YOU CAN'T DO THIS! BARNEY, HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU NOT TO BOTHER ME THIS WAY? SORRY I BUSTED IN ON YOU, MISTER. THAT BOY'S HITCHED AND WALKED MILES TO GET HERE. PRETTY GOOD CONTROL FOR A YOUNG PITCHER. WATCH HIM THROW A COUPLE! MONTY! MONTY, DON'T GO RUNNING AWAY LIKE THIS. COUNTRY! COUNTRY!

BUT FOR PETE'S SAKE, GET HIM A HAIRCUT. SURE, JIMMY, SURE. IN FIVE MINUTES. OK. YOU GET FOUR FOR ONE? THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT, BUDDY. HEY, LOU! HOW WOULD YOU LIKE A DATE FOR TONIGHT? FINE.

DANCING WITH YOU IS LIKE DANCING ON A CLOUD. SHARE IT AROUND. THAT'S RIGHT. ON YOUR FEET, DOTTIE. I'M SORRY I CAN'T ASK YOU TO DANCE, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW. OH... THAT'S ALL RIGHT. OH, I GUESS BASEBALL'S ABOUT ALL I KNOW. WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING. SEEN US WORK OUT YET? US? WHO'S US? THE CHICAGO WHITE SOX. NO. NO, I GUESS THAT'S THE ONE THING I'VE MISSED. WELL, THE TEAM LOOKS GOOD... LOOKS AWFUL GOOD. PLAYS NICE TIGHT INFIELD... OH, THAT'S NICE. I BET YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD YOURSELF. WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I'M STILL TRYING OUT. YOU'RE A BIG FELLA. I'LL BET YOU CAN HIT A BASEBALL PRETTY FAR. NO, I'M NOT EXPECTED TO HIT VERY MUCH. YOU SEE, I'M A PITCHER. WELL... I BET YOU CAN PITCH FAR. NO, YOU... YOU DON'T GET THE IDEA. I JUST HAVE TO PITCH ABOUT 60 FEET. ALL RIGHT, THEN. I'LL BET YOU CAN PITCH FAST. WELL, SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO REAR BACK AND SORT OF LET HER GO FAST, AND OTHER TIMES, YOU JUST SORT OF WHIP IT, CURVE HER IN. OR IN SOME SPOTS, YOU JUST SORT OF FLOAT HER IN. THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL CHANGE OF PACE. SPEAKING OF... CHANGE OF PACE... IT PROBABLY ISN'T ANY OF MY BUSINESS, BUT... WOULD YOU MIND TELLING ME WHAT THAT NOISE IS? WHAT WHAT? JINGLING NOISE. OH! OH... LOOK AT THAT. I WAS GOING TO GET A HAIRCUT AT THE HOTEL, AND I NOTICED THOSE MACHINES IN THE LOBBY. I NEVER DID SEE THEM BEFORE. I SORT OF WONDERED ABOUT THEM, AND BEFORE I KNEW IT, I POPPED A QUARTER IN, AND A WHOLE LOT OF FRUIT STARTED SPINNING AROUND. AND THEN IT SORT OF SLID TO A STOP AND NOTHING HAPPENED. AND BEFORE I KNEW IT, I POPPED IN ANOTHER QUARTER... THAT WAS THE LAST OF THE HAIRCUT. I WAS DOWN TO MY LAST QUARTER. BUT I FIGURED I MIGHT AS WELL BE BROKE AS THE WAY I WAS, SO IN WENT THE LAST QUARTER. FRUIT TOOK OFF AGAIN AND SLOWED UP AND STOPPED. ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE QUARTERS STARTED POPPING OUT LIKE HENS THROUGH A BUSTED FENCE. WENT AND GOT A HAIRCUT. WELL, IF YOU DON'T MAKE IT IN BASEBALL, YOU'VE A PRETTY GOOD FUTURE IN GAMBLING. NAW, I'M THROUGH GAMBLING. WHY? I FOUND OUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LOSE AND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WIN. WHY KEEP AT IT? YES, SIR. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A BIG NIGHT OF IT. THERE'S A LOT OF SPOTS IN CALIFORNIA FOR HAVING A GOOD TIME. AND, ETHEL, I'M GOING TO SHOW THEM ALL TO YOU. I WOULDN'T PUT YOU TO ALL THAT TROUBLE. TROUBLE? NO TROUBLE AT ALL! SHOWING YOU A GOOD TIME WILL BE A PLEASURE. THERE'S A LITTLE PLACE UP AT MALIBU... SOFT MUSIC, DANCING UNDER THE STARS. BUT OF COURSE IF YOU GO FOR HOT MUSIC, THERE'S AN OUTFIT IN HOLLYWOOD THAT REALLY BEATS IT OUT. BABY, WHEN I GET THROUGH SHOWING YOU THIS TOWN, YOU WON'T EVER WANT TO GO BACK TO OMAHA. WE'LL MAKE THE ROUNDS. AND WHAT WE DON'T HIT TONIGHT, WE'LL HIT TOMORROW NIGHT. JUST LEAVE IT TO ME. YOUR UNCLE EDDIE'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING. HAVE FUN, I ALWAYS SAY. NOW, WHAT'S THE USE OF LIVING IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GOOD TIME? YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE, AND YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU. LET'S GO. WHERE? HOME. WHY, COUNTRY? THE NIGHT'S YOUNG. LOTS OF SPOTS WE HAVEN'T HIT YET. YOU HIT 'EM. WE'RE HEADING HOME. I'VE VERY GLAD TO HAVE MET YOU. GOOD NIGHT. DID IT OCCUR TO YOU THAT I MIGHT HAVE WANTED TO GO WITH EDDIE? WELL, WHAT YOU WANTED WASN'T SO IMPORTANT. OH, IT WASN'T? NO, NO. WHAT WAS IMPORTANT WAS THE WAY EDDIE WAS TREATING DOT. IF HE WAS TRYING TO SHINE UP TO YOU, HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT IN FRONT OF HER. OR IN FRONT OF YOU. NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN. LOOK, I... I'M... I'M SORRY ABOUT TONIGHT. YOU SORT OF GOT STUCK WITH ME, DIDN'T YOU? OH, THAT'S SILLY. NO, IT ISN'T. NO, IT ISN'T. I JUST NEVER HAD MUCH EXPERIENCE WITH GIRLS. WHAT'S SO FUNNY? AND YOU GOT STUCK WITH THE CHECK. IT WAS WORTH IT TO GET OUT OF THERE. HERE WE ARE. WELL, GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT, MONTY. MONTY, I'M SORRY ABOUT TONIGHT. I BEHAVED VERY BADLY. BUT I HAVEN'T HAD TOO MUCH EXPERIENCE MYSELF WITH BALL PLAYERS. WELL, I'M NOT EXACTLY A BALL PLAYER YET. I STILL HAVE TO MAKE THE TEAM. YOU'LL MAKE IT. HOW DO YOU KNOW?

BARNEY, DID YOU HEAR THAT? WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, BARNEY? WELL, IF IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU, I'D LIKE TO TAG ALONG WITH THE BOY. CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE JUST TAGGING ALONG. LOOK, MR. DYKES... CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE HANGING AROUND DOING NOTHING. JIMMY, I'LL DO ANYTHING. WHAT COULD YOU DO? OFFHAND, I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING, UNLESS... YOU'D LIKE TO COACH THE YOUNG PITCHERS. HI. HELLO, MR. DYKES. HI. WE DIDN'T HAVE TOO MUCH TIME, DID WE? ENOUGH TO MAKE ME WISH IT WAS MORE. MAYBE THERE WILL BE. YOU GOT ANY DOUBTS ABOUT IT? CALIFORNIA TURNED OUT MUCH BETTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD. YES, IT WAS NICE, YOUR MAKING THE TEAM, WASN'T IT? THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN, AND YOU KNOW IT. I KNOW, MONTY. ALL ABOARD! GOOD-BYE, ETHEL. LET'S GET GOING, BOY. ALL RIGHT. YOU WILL WRITE, WON'T YOU?

IF I EVER GET A CHANCE TO USE IT. DON'T RUSH IT, SON. YOU GET AN EDUCATION THIS WAY. AND A GOOD VIEW OF THE GAME. I SHOULD BE PAYING FOR THIS SEAT. EASY, BOY. OH, THOSE YANKEES ARE MURDER. TIME!

"OF COURSE, STRATTON WAS HELPED CONSIDERABLY BY A NEAR-SIGHTED UMPIRE." WHAT WAS THAT? "THE UMPIRE SAW HOME PLATE UNDER THE BALL NO MATTER WHERE STRATTON THREW." AND STRATTON CAUGHT THE INSIDE CORNER! "WHEN STRATTON PITCHED, THE SAFEST PLACE TO STAND..." STRATTON CAUGHT THE OUTSIDE CORNER. "HE FLOATED THEM UP LIKE BIG WHITE BALLOONS..." STRATTON SMOTE ONE DOWN THE MIDDLE. "THEN THE INFIELDERS"... OW! AH! AH! AH! AH! AH! AH! AH! AH! HOW LONG WILL I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH ALL THIS ABUSE? OH, ABOUT 70 OR 80 YEARS, I HOPE.

I WONDER WHY HE CAME BACK ALONE. MONTY. MONTY. MONTY, WHAT HAPPENED? I GUESS I SHOT THE WRONG RABBIT. THERE'S NO ALTERNATIVE. IT'S HIS LEG OR HIS LIFE. BUT HIS LEGS ARE HIS LIFE. THE INFECTION IS SPREADING. IF WE DON'T OPERATE IMMEDIATELY... BUT HIS LEG... HE'S A BALL PLAYER. HE'S A MAN WHOSE LIFE IS IN DANGER. WE MUST HAVE YOUR PERMISSION TO OPERATE. I FLEW DOWN AS SOON AS I HEARD. OH, BARNEY. THAT'S RIGHT, KID. CRY IT OUT. BARNEY, HIS LEG... I KNOW. I KNOW. WELL, HE... HE HAD SOME INNINGS. AT LEAST HE HAD THAT. GUESS YOU'RE GLAD TO BE BACK, HUH?

IF PEOPLE ARE NICE ENOUGH TO WRITE THEM, YOU SHOULD READ THEM. IF YOU LIKE THEM SO MUCH, WHY DON'T YOU READ THEM YOURSELF? WHAT DO THEY SAY, "MERRY CHRISTMAS, HAPPY NEW YEAR"? AH. NOT ENOUGH EGGS TO PAY FOR THE FEED. HMM. AIN'T TOO BIG, NEITHER. NO. MONTY GOIN' TO START MOVIN' AROUND SOON? I'M TRYING TO GET HIM TO. YOU FIGURE HE'S GONNA? IT'S UP TO HIM. ACTIVE FELLA LIKE HE WAS OUGHT TO GET AROUND. HE EVER GOIN' TO USE THAT LEG THEY MADE FOR HIM? I DON'T KNOW, EARNIE. ETHEL'S DOIN' THE BEST SHE CAN, BUT SHE CAN'T NAG HIM. HE'S GONNA HAVE TO WANT TO DO SOMETHIN' BEFORE HE DOES IT. I'VE BEEN STRAIGHTENING OUT THE SHED. A LOT OF STUFF'S PILED UP. COME OUT AND TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT TO GET RID OF. GET RID OF IT ALL. I SUPPOSE THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF LYING AROUND WE DON'T NEED. BUT I THOUGHT MAYBE THERE WOULD BE SOME THINGS YOU'D WANT TO HANG ON TO... LIKE THIS BALL THE TEAM ALL SIGNED. I'M SORRY. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, MA? I GUESS THERE'S NOTHIN' YOU CAN DO... EXCEPT KEEP ON TRYIN' AND HOPIN'. BUT HE ISN'T INTERESTED IN ANYTHING... OR ANYBODY. EVERYTHING I DO OR SAY SEEMS TO DRIVE HIM FURTHER AWAY. HE'S ALL BY HIMSELF. I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO REACH HIM. I GUESS IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT IF HE WAS LETTIN' IT ROLL OFF HIS BACK LIKE IT WAS NOTHIN'. I KNOW MONTY. HE'S... HE'S TAKING A BAD BEATING NOW, BUT ONE OF THESE DAYS HE'LL START SWINGIN' BACK. BUT WILL HE, MA? DO YOU THINK HE WILL? WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MONTY. GOOD SENSE, I GUESS YOU'D CALL IT. BUT WHATEVER YOU CALL IT, IF YOU'VE GOT IT, NO DOCTOR CAN AMPUTATE IT. HOW'S THE COTTON LOOK, EARNIE? GOOD. WHAT YOU FIGURE IT'LL COME TO?

LET'S SEE YOU DO THAT AGAIN. HERE. COME ON. LOOK, MONTY. HE'S STARTING TO WALK. ISN'T THAT WONDERFUL? WHAT'S SO WONDERFUL ABOUT IT? HE'S GOT TWO LEGS, HASN'T HE? LOOK AT THAT ROAD. I USED TO DO 10 MILES ON THAT ROAD LIKE IT WAS NOTHIN', JUST TO PITCH A GAME. NOW I CAN HARDLY REACH IT, LET ALONE WALK ON IT. THEN TO TOP EVERYTHING ELSE, NOW I'M ORNERY INTO THE BARGAIN. I SHOULDN'T HAVE SOUNDED OFF BEFORE. YOU HAVE IT ROUGH ENOUGH AS IT IS. I'M NOT COMPLAINING. MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER IF YOU DID. YOU CAN'T KEEP IT ALL STORED UP INSIDE YOU. YOU TOLD ME ONCE... A MAN'S GOT TO KNOW WHERE HE'S GOING. WHERE ARE YOU GOING, MONTY? I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS I'M JUST NOT GOING. AND YOU SAID YOU COULDN'T LET ME DOWN. WHAT ABOUT THE BABY? MA? YOURSELF?

BALL 2! BALL 3! THEY GOT TO PUT IN A PINCH HITTER NOW. BALL 4! THERE'S A PINCH HITTER FOR STRATTON, BASES LOADED, TWO OUT. MONTY, I'D SURE LIKE TO SEE YOU FINISH THIS GAME IF IT WAS JUST UP TO ME, BUT THESE GUYS HAVE A BIG STAKE IN THIS GAME. I THINK I CAN GET THEM IN.

I'LL HAVE TO GET OFF THE MOUND QUICKER, THAT'S ALL. I'LL GET OUT THERE. ALL RIGHT, FELLA. PLAY BALL! ALL RIGHT, BATTER UP, GANG! MONTY! MONTY WAS OFF THE MOUND WITH THE PITCH AND NAILED THAT MAN AT FIRST. HE'S NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET. RUNNERS ADVANCE TO SECOND AND THIRD. ONLY ONE OUT. HEY, EDDIE. HE'S MOVING AROUND TOO GOOD NOW. TAKE A CUT AT IT. HEY, THAT'S OK! THAT'S OK! STRIKE! THEY'RE TAKING FULL CUTS. ANY HIT WILL DO IT. EVEN A LONG FLY WILL TIE IT UP. STRIKE 2! ONE MORE, MONTY! ONE MORE! STRIKE 3! YOU'RE OUT! AND BOCKMAN WENT DOWN SWINGING FOR THE SECOND OUT. THIS NEXT ONE CAN BE THE BIG OUT FOR MONTY. LOOK WHO'S COMING UP... THE POWER HITTER OF THE LEAGUE, BIG JOHNNY LINDELL! HERE YOU GO, MONTY.
