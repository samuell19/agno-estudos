Does anyone remember when those ten amendments were ratified? I think it's 1791, but I'm not gonna say that 'cause that's something a great big nerd would say, and I don't want to come across too smart. I want to be, like, kind of smart, like... like a cool kind of smart. You know, it's not cool to be too smart, so I'm just gonna stay in, like, a nice gray area, kind of like, ooh, mystery man. That's correct, Jeremy. 1791. Hmm? So... 1791. That was a long time ago. It's older than me. I wonder how old Mrs. McCann is? She's looking a little rough these days. Hmm? No, I didn't... I didn't mean, like you're... I didn't mean like you're rough, like you're old. You look so young. Like, how are you so young? Like, that's crazy that you were born in... Uh, yeah. You're aged, like, in a good way. Like you're worn in, like you're like a worn in... like a good, worn-in glove that you like to wear, like you've got a lot of... You're well-worn. So, like, how old are...? Uh, like... So stupid. I did see some gray hairs, though. Ooh, those were not looking good. Jeremy. Yep? The other day, when I asked you for more participation, this is not what I had in mind. Yeah. I'm gonna be honest with you. I don't even know what I'm saying. Okay, so the Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791. I gotta pee... or I'm just nervous. Oh, no, it's both. I've gotta pee and I'm nervous. Can I go pee, please? Yes, Jeremy, yes. I'm gonna go. Oh, not mystery chili again. This stuff goes right through me. Um, I mean, yeah, it looks great. Yeah, great for constipation. I know where I'm gonna be in 40 minutes and it ain't math class. Move.

She thinks you're crazy. She thinks you're crazy. She's not following any of this. Okay, just because I'm not buying it doesn't mean that I'm not following. Look, Vic, my whole life, people have been telling me to speak up, spit it out, don't be afraid to express yourself. That's what they would say. And now I am, but I can't stop. I'm scared. Okay.

Um, you can counteract that glitch by, uh, learning to speak up for yourself. No, you don't understand. That's exactly what I'm doing, okay? And I can't stop. How do I shut it off? No, no. Don't-- Don't shut it off. Um, you need to learn to-- to take control of it, okay? You can take a public speaking class or join a choir or, uh, run for class president-- Yeah, you sound exactly like my teacher. I still don't understand how almost getting electrocuted in a shopping mall gave me diarrhea of the mouth. Kid, if I knew for sure, I wouldn't be making $8 an hour. So, if you can't shut it off, then you need to control it. Don't just blurt things out. Control the blurt. Blurt. That's a funny word. Blurt. That sounds like you just blurt... blurt things...

She's gonna ask me to run for president again. Just run. Yes, you should run. No, I mean, like I should run. Like I should-- like I should get out of here. Like I should leave because I can't run for president. Or can I? Maybe I can. Maybe I should. Here. Our first election meeting is this afternoon. Just think about it, Jeremy. Just think about it? I can't just think about it. I'm gonna start singing the national anthem. ♪ Oh, say, can you see ♪ Oh, God. No, I can't run for president, okay? With my mouth oozing nonsense. I'm gonna humiliate myself. Or maybe it'll be good for you. You know, Richie Capris is unbeatable. I mean, he's like a charming, teenage unicorn. Uhh! Do you hear me? I'm telling you, the last thing I need is a microphone. Okay, Richie Capris is not unbeatable. I mean, think about all those kids who don't use their voice, kids who never speak up for themselves. You'll be their champion. My sister is oddly smart sometimes. It really sneaks up on you.Hey, Jerry! Oh, look. Here comes your competition. Be cool. I've been looking everywhere for you. Oh, no, it's Richie. I'd better go tell him... So, uh, did you do that little, uh, thing we were talking about, or...? What's that, dude? Like... I can't understand you because of, you know, your hand. No. I didn't do your papers, okay, Richie? And I'm not going to. What? Dude, I thought you were cool. No. You're cool, Richie, and I'm a nobody, but that doesn't give you the right to dump all your work on other people. Dude, if you're gonna get all touchy about it, man, you don't... I'm not being... I'm not being touchy, okay? You're being touchy, sunbeam eyes. I'm sorry. I'm... I'm so sorry. Yeah, that's a good one, buddy. Like I'd ever let somebody do one of my papers... Jerry. It's Jeremy. What's that? My name is Jeremy Martin, and I'm running for president. Yeah, well, good luck with that, Jerry. This interaction was scary but weirdly empowering. Need more tape. Hey, uh, do you mind? Uh, the tape? Thanks. What's this for? Oh, um, well, I'm Jeremy Martin, and I'm gonna be running for class president. Isn't that Richie Capris' job? Yes, but I'm going to be running against him. I like it even better 'cause he wins those things. That's not true, because I bring a lot of different things to the table that Richie doesn't. What makes you different? Well, um, first of all, I'm a hard worker and Richie is kind of lazy and he's very popular while I'm socially awkward and he has snappy clothes while I just kind of wear whatever my mom picks out for me. Why am I telling your this? And Richie has probably kissed a girl, while I am still practicing on my hand. You know what? That gives me an idea. I'm gonna do something I should have done a long time ago. I'm so excited that we have more than one candidate this year. This is going to be a really fun race. Oh, here's a copy of your schedule. Hey, man. Hmm? Hmm? What gives? Why are you running against me? What's with the tape? Is that, like, a political statement or some sort of gimmick? 'Cause, either way, it's dumb. So, to begin, I need all three of you to review the campaign rules. Uh, three? Whoa! Where did you come from? I've been here the whole time. Over the next couple of days, I'd encourage all three candidates to meet with different clubs and organizations, hear their concerns, discuss your positions. Uh, is that, like, a mandatory thing? Well, it'd certainly help your chances. I think I'll be okay. Ah... Now, Jeremy, I really admire the duct tape statement. Great example of non-verbal protest. Very subversive.Hmm? But, you do know, at some point, you're gonna have to talk. Hmm? I'll see you on the campaign trail, bro. Hey, I just wanted to say I think the tape is a great touch. Simple but powerful. Hmm. I mean, that's the whole reason I even talked myself into running-- to give a voice to the voiceless and maybe find my voice too. I love it. Fight the power. Hmm. Voice to the voiceless? I like that. Maybe I can win. Hey, vote for Jeremy! Vote for Jeremy! Vote for Jeremy! Vote for Jeremy! Vote for Jeremy! Do you want to vote for Jeremy? Here you go. Vote for Jeremy. Yeah. He'll be a great president. Hi. Would you like a button? Hi. Would you like to discuss the problems with the gym? Do you have any issues? We could talk about 'em. Who wants pizza? Whoo! Get in here! Vote for Richie! Vote for Richie! Jer-bear, come on! Grab a slice! First of all, um, I would like to say that I am a great admirer of the drama club. When I become president, I'm going to ban all uses of the words "drama geeks" and "drama nerds" because I think it's very offensive and, frankly, very inaccurate. Chess is a game that requires intense focus, mental dexterity. It seems like a pretty peaceful environment. Oh, giant robot baby! What the heck is that? Relax. It's the basketball team's new scoreboard. Bienvenido, Jeremy. Why should the Spanish club vote for you? Well, I really think that we can... Uh-uh-uh! Hmm, do I have to? Mm-hmm. Okay. Yoga club. Oh, you guys are so Zen. I like it, I like it. All right. Nice pants. All right, let's do this. Yes, you in the... What is that? Like, a pirate jacket? Uh, we have our big fall musical coming up, but the auditorium is double-booked with the flamenco dance club. What can you do to fix that? Wow, get a little bit of power, and even the drama nerds want a piece of you. Uh, totally inaccurate. Totally inaccurate. Gracias. Well, I'm sure if we put our brains together, we could... That's a little distracting. Just a little bit. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Please don't fart, please don't fart. Come on, don't fart. Don't fart. Hold it in, Jeremy. Yo! Good luck, Jeremy.You got our vote. Who wants pizza? Vote for Richie! Oh, yeah, get in here. Don't be shy. The man's a political genius. Look, why don't I talk to the dancers and we'll see if we can reschedule something, try and make it work. ♪♪ No way. We booked it first. Those drama nerds need to find a different venue. First of all, that's offensive, all right? You guys wouldn't want to be called dan... You wouldn't... uh, what's the comparison word for dance geeks? Dance nerds? Flamina... Flamaniacs? Flamaniacs? I'm gonna go with dance geeks. You wouldn't want to be called dance geeks. Where'd you guys come from? I don't know what that means.Out! Well, you think about it. Okay, I'm gonna go. I'm going, I'm going. When did you get so fluido? Well, I wish I could say that I've been studying really hard, but really, I'm just obsessed with a Mexican soap opera where the actress looks kind of like Corinne Spruce, who I'm secretly infatuated with. So, are you guys gonna vote? I think I just farted, but not to worry, 'cause it was silent. Perfect crime. ♪♪ Yo! Different day, same jackets! ♪ Bah bah bah bah ♪ Send that to me. Richie, losing votes but still handsome. What is going on? There she is. What a woman. How did I do that? Did that just happen? I talked and she smiled. It's like 1,000 love songs playing in my head at once. I know your struggles because I was there too. I know what it's like to not be able to speak up. I know what it's like to clam up and to want to shrink away when that really pretty girl or that big kid or that scary janitor looks in your direction. Pizza time! Who's hungry? Shh! Shh! I know what it's like to be so nervous when the teacher calls your name that-- that your hands are sweaty and your face is numb, but I'm here to help you guys find your voice, to give you a voice and to give you a voice. Everybody gets a voice! Dear Diary, I still haven't learned how to control my inside voice, but people actually like what I have to say. I've made so many new friends and Corinne smiled at me again today. I have narrowed down our future wedding songs to three options. Which one of these do you think I should wear to my dance recital? What are you doing? Get out! Privacy! Come on! You do know that we can hear you "writing" in your diary from every room in the house, right? Mental note-- when I become president, my sister gets the lowest possible security clearance. Jeremy, if you win, you know it's not just about popularity, right? You have a real job to do. I like the blue bow. That's the one I'd go with... if I was a girl. Um, thanks. I-- I didn't... Okay, listen, I'm really excited for you and everything, but just remember that popularity corrupts. I could totally rock that bow. President Jeremy Martin. Mr. Martin, your secretary is on the line. Hold it. I'm busy.Hey, there. That's a girl's voice. Hey. Jeremy, I know we've gone to the same school for a long time now, but I've never really noticed you until recently. That's actually very good news. It means she doesn't remember me pooping my pants in the first grade on the seesaw. You're too much. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, mm-hmm. This is an awkward silence. I should say something. I should ask her out. What? No. Stop! Stop talking! Stop! It's okay. You can ask me out. Really? Yeah. Um, do you want to go out with me? I'd love to. Yes! You're the best! Thank you! Thank you! Is this actually happening? Yes! How about Cafe Diem, today after school? Cafe Diem. That's where all the cool kids go to take pictures of their food. Highly exclusive. Yes. Uh, wait. Today? Yeah. My sister has a dance recital at 5:00. Oh, well, if you'd rather do that than go out with me... No, it's fine. I'll-- I'll do both. Okay. Okay. I'll see you there. Awesome. Okay. Okay, bye. So, you know, if you win the election, the class president gets final say over the yearbook. So, if I, like, oh, I don't know, wanted my very own yearbook page... Oh. Is that something you'd be open to discussing? Uh, yeah! Hi, Jeremy. Yeah. Oh, hey, what are you doing here? Oh, you know, just passing out fliers, practicing for the debate tomorrow. Are you ready? For the debate? The debate. Yes, I'm ready. I'm prepared. I am so not ready. I have no idea what I'm gonna do about the flamenco dancers and the chess club with the scoreboard. You know, I've actually been looking into the whole double-booking thing. I think if we can get the flamenco club to perform during the drama club's intermission, they'd sell twice as many tickets and everybody wins. Wow, that's... That's a great idea. And the chess club thing is tricky, but here's what I came up with-- speed chess. Maybe we could get the chess club players to use the scoreboard buzzer to keep time while playing rounds of speed chess. Are you running for president too? Yeah. Would you like a flier? It sums up all my points and how... But why? You're not even popular. Uh, okay. Maybe I'm not very popular, but I'm running for president because I believe every voice deserves a platform, not just the loud ones. Good luck tomorrow.Thanks. Wow. That was kind of mean. Corinne is kind of stuck-up and snotty. How come I've never noticed this before? It's probably because she's hot. Jeremy. Hmm? Yep? A little free advice. Mm-hmm. If you're gonna be president, don't make friends with the competition. Wait. You really think I could win? Oh, honey, with my help, you've got this thing wrapped up with a bow on top. Anyway, my yearbook page... I was thinking... Bow on top. ...pink, and then I've got this... My sister's dance recital. Um... Oh, I'm sorry. It's already 5:00. Uh, I have to go. What? Now?

I love it. Come on, you guys. Oh! Whoo! Oh! Okay. Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot. They have Corinne Spruce moderating this? What are you doing? That's my podium. Candidates, please take your podiums. You're going down, Jerry. Hello, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome. Our first question is for Richie Capris. Richie, according to attendance records, you were absent on March 7th of last year. On that very same day, somebody stole Tyler Healy's bike from the bike rack. So, where were you really on March 7th? Uh, what? Is that a real question? I was sick. I didn't steal anything. The next question is for Jeremy Martin. Jeremy, how are you today? This close to throwing up. Thanks for asking. I think the next question is Milly's. Jeremy, it seems like the flamenco dancers and drama club have double-booked the auditorium for the same three days. How would you resolve this conflict? The flamenco dancers could perform during the drama club's intermission. They'd sell twice as many tickets and everybody wins. I'm sorry. Milly, same question. Uh, I agree with Jeremy. Hmm. Mmh-hmm. Sorry. And Jeremy, the chess club has been complaining about noise from the basketball team's scoreboard. How would you resolve this issue? Uh... You can't do this. You can't steal Milly's answer. What are you talking about? This is war. What is this? This is the election. This is everything you ever wanted. I can't believe I'm losing to this guy. Speed chess! The chess players could use the noise from the scoreboard to play speed chess. I'm sorry. Milly, same question. Um, I don't know what to say. Same answer as Jeremy, I guess. Interesting. Richie, on November 14th, you signed out of school early and on that very same day, Nicole Pecoro's dog was hit by a car! Oh, come on! You've got to be kidding me! Do we really want a president who hits people's dogs with their cars? And you look silly in that tie, right? It's my dad's tie! Wait, wait, wait, wait! I... I have something to say. Oh. All my answers... they weren't mine. They were Milly's. She's got a lot of great ideas, and there's three of us up here today, but she's the only one doing it for the right reasons. Look, I've done a lot of talking during this election, but I now realize what having a voice is for. It's for speaking up for what's right and being honest. I could stand here and tell you all the reasons why Milly is the best president for you guys, but you know what? She can tell you herself. Thank you, Jeremy. Well, that was all very inspiring, but if little Milly Terkel is done stealing all the thunder, I think we can move on. Uh, actually, Corinne, I'm just getting started. Next question. ♪♪ You! I'm so proud of you! Really? You still think I'm cool even if I didn't win the election? Oh, no, don't be silly. I never thought you were cool. Oh, Jeremy! That was... You didn't have to do that. Of course I did. You deserve to win. Wow, I never really noticed this before, but Milly's kind of cute. Wait. Whoa! Did I just think that? I think I did! And now I'm thinking this, in my head! I'm back, baby! Yes! I can scream whatever I want at the top of my mind! Yes! Thank you! Thank you so much! I got my inside voice back! Wait, really? Yeah. Watch this. Uh... I dropped your curling iron in the toilet and I never even told you. Wow! That's great! I know, right? I know. So, your brother, he's kind of cute. He can be a little outspoken. I have a filter! I'm thinking weird stuff and nobody knows it! What a day! Hey! What an amaz-- Oh! What is your problem? I was handing you the election and you blew it! Oh, mercy, she smells good. Maybe I should ask her out again. No. You know what? Stop, stop. Corinne... Actually, Corinne, I don't need my inside voice to say this. Look, you might be really cool and popular and admittedly really pretty, but if this is what being cool and popular is, then I'd rather just be nice. ♪ Ooh, dream weaver ♪ ♪ I believe you can get me through the night ♪ ♪♪ Wait. He doesn't worship me anymore. So, I guess everybody does want their voice to be heard, and together, we can all do great things. I'm so proud of my brother. He's 17 years old and he finally learned how to speak up for himself, and since I'm the one that dragged him to the mall way back in the beginning, you might even say that I'm the hero of this whole story. Not like I need any big props or anything, but, yeah, total hero. Right now, you're probably thinking, this is it, the end of my story, but then again, the human mind is a great big chasm, full of mystery and wonder, so if you're wondering what comes next or if we'll ever meet again, all I can say is, get out of my head already. ♪Ooh, dream weaver ♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪
