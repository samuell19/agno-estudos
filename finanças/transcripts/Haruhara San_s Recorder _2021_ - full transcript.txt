Stand by the tree. Over there. Stop that. Ready? Oh, stop that. Playing hide and seek? - Hello. - Welcome It's chilly today. Yeah, it is. I saw cherry blossoms. They are beautiful. What's your order? Coffee. No alcohol? I have things to do later. I see. I'll drink some when it's done. Thanks for waiting. It's pretty. It's a better view from here. The blossoms are lasting longer in this weather. Please come back again. - It's good. - Good. - It's warm. - It is. Haruhara-san's Recorder Sorry for coming late. No. Here's the key. Thank you. Let's see... Oh, the numbers for utilities. I've written them down. Thanks. What else? Everything is fine. Really? Let me think. Oh, the mailbox. I've removed my name. I turned in my change of address, so it should be OK. If any mails come to me, I'd say, just ditch 'em. Even important ones? May I? It's my family address. For the postal fee. - I can't accept it. - Just keep it. OK. Thanks. I'll keep it. I'll forward them. Thank you so much. Miyazaki. I've never been there. Nice place. It's the land of divinity. Come to Miyazaki when you feel depressed. Divinity... Miyazaki has a lot of myths. Oh, you are from Hokkaido. Yes. It's also the land of gods. I guess. Can I really leave it like this? Yes. Really? You're such a character, Sacchan. - They are very useful. - I see. Can I leave this as well? Water it once a week. That'll do. - I'll take it if it's too much. - I'll keep it. Really? Good! Thanks. It was a present... ...Well, I'm going. No need to see me off. May I? Hidaka-san. Thank you so much. Don't mention it. Thanks. Stay safe. You, too. Oh, hello. - Thank you. - Hello. You've just come back? No. I'm heading out to go shopping. I might sleep, but it's better to go outside. I see. Hey, what is this? It is cute. Have you always had this? It's Hidaka-san's. Oh, he's already gone. It's sad. He said he would show us around Miyazaki. There's a place I want to go. Where? Let's see, this place, um, it's on the tip of my tongue. It's the place of myth. - Where was that? - A lot of myths in Miyazaki. Hey, what about his room? He recommended it to everyone that it's cheap and good. Really? Moving over there? I've already moved there. Seriously? Like, wow. How's the room? Really nice. Well-ventilated. Oh, he said that. But, isn't it hard to commute? Yes. But it's a nice distance. - Oh, you are back. - Hi, you are home. Did you eat lunch? I'll make the pasta. No one is upstairs. I'll have more perhaps. Well, coffee. Coffee? Do you want to try, Sacchan? Hurrah for you. Don't you eat lunch with him? Can I? Thank you. Well... Um, it's a strange favor to ask... Can I film you while you are eating? For a project at the university. A project. Yes. While I am eating? Yes. Um, it is strictly for the class. Really. It is a project. All right. Sure? I just eat, right? Yes, please. Hello. Around here, right? Well, uncle. You'd better call first. Right. Sorry. I had something to do for business near here. Wanna ride? My apartment is there. Oh, there... Is there a parking place? I'll find it somewhere. I'll look around. Nice place. Oh, here you are. Thank you. Put it over there. The door? Leave it open. Can I put my backpack here? Wash your hands? Can I? Oops. sorry. Oh, what's your job? What do you do? Now? I'm working at a cafe. A coffee shop. Is it far? Quite far. - But it's fun. - Is it? That's good to know. - Didn't you do this? - We did. - What was it? "Wasshoi"? - Yes. - Feint movements! - Yes. My arms! Hot! I'm playing defense. C'mon, just take a shot! Is anyone there? - Yes. I'll block the ball. - I'll pass through them. Let me give you this before I forget. Thank you very much. Thank you for coming. I should have sent it. But I felt it would be better to hand it to you. And I wanted to see you. Thank you. Is everyone fine? Ah, the business as usual. Fine. Azumaya-san said hello. She wanted to see you. She doesn't talk much about you, but seemed a little worried. I've been worried about you. I know it's uncomfortable to hear this. I just feel sorry. I'll visit you some time. All of them will be glad. But, don't rush. Now I remember. May I? For everyone to know how you are doing. Thanks. Thank you. Here you are. I'll have some. Sacchan, are you free now? I am. Can I ask you a strange favor? Kinda scary. This is the script for my next play. Oh, great. Nothing great. I am bad at remembering the lines. Stupid, aren't I? No, you are not. You're so sweet. I can remember better with someone beside me. If it's OK, could you sit over there for me? It won't take long. - Yes. - OK? I appreciate it. Wait a sec. Sacchan. Could you keep looking at me? - I'm embarassed. - I know. Bear with it for a while. Here I go. "I can hear your voice." "Among the jungle of buildings, on the narrow strip of soil." "Your brutally pale arms can be seen..., are spread..." "With the blouse..., the lavender blouse's neckline..." "You..., you look so different from..." "You look so different..., so dramatically different..." "You..., you show it for the first time..." "Your neck revealed from the lavender blouse dramatically..." Thank you. You helped me a lot. I did nothing. Thanks. Not at all. Well, I'll give it a try. Good luck. Off you go. Excuse me. Excuse me. Are you looking for something? Ah, yes I am. Can I ask you something? I want to go to this place. - Here? - Yes, it is. Sorry but I am bad with directions. Oh, could you wait a moment? Can I show her the directions? It's that way. Excuse me. Could you take a picture? Here it is. OK. Thanks. Oh, just press here and it's fine. OK, here I go. Thank you so much. Sachi? It's your auntie, Taeko. Oh, hey. Sorry. I was asleep. - Good morning. - Good morning. What time? 10:30. I slept so much. Fine? - Can I come in or wait? - Come right in. Thanks. Here I am. I should buy just the amount I need, or it goes bad. - As a single household... - You should pre-cook some. - Pre-cook. I see. - Yes. - Use them with some takeout. - I see. - Enough. - OK. - Bring the water to a boil. - Heating up. - Can I boil the noodles? - Yes, go ahead. - Rather rough. - Rough way to open this. Enough? Enough. Here are some cakes. It's cool without the air conditioning. Sorry about lunch. No. It's better this way. My apologies. Have you find a good place? I haven't. Don't know much. I see. Have the cake. Thank you. It's good. May I? Cute. Can I send it to Satoko-san? Do you want this? No, thanks. It's a nice picture. What's up? Did you tell him? Tell whom? Uncle Takeshi. What? He's here, perhaps. He is? Did he call you? No. He's always like that. I know. What should I do? Hide? Will you? Could you tell? I can tell. - I thought about calling... - Fine. What's up? I'm just stopping by to see you. You came here last week. I know. OK. Come in. Thanks. I'm coming in. My hands... Oh, someone was here. She's gone now. What is it? What's the problem? Some tissue? Oh, sorry. The sound... There? What is it? Is it there? What's going on? Why don't you open it? - You open it. - Wait, what's this? - Please open it. - What is it? I'm not good at this kind of stuff. - Oh. What are you doing? - Same to you. - What is she doing? - What are you doing? Why are you here? Wh-what is this? I found it here. What the heck are you doing? Oh, so these areTaeko's. I see. Taeko's... I got it. - I see. - What? Do you want some? I'll take one. They aren't yours. Well, there are actually a lot. - Then I'll have this one. - Are you going to have that? - Did you have it already? - I did. Well, I can have some... This is good, you know. - Is it? I am quite full. - It's good. - It's big. - Big? We can share. No. Sachi and I will share it. - Why don't you share with me? - I don't want to share with you. You don't... Oh, well. It's fine with me. What flavor is it? I am going to have this. I bought it for Sachi. - Big, isn't it? - It is. You guys share, don't you? Thank you. Let's eat. Let's eat. Bon appetit. It's warm. Is it? It's from the heat. It's online. Their physiques are so special. They go like this, you know the regular stuff? The movements are refined, but I can't keep up. You can't help it. They are great. - You look like a dancer. - Really? You look cool. They go, "Raise your arms and keep your chin down." - She's now a ballet beginner. - I am. Wonderful. I can't do much, but I will learn inch by inch. See you. Thanks. - I'll come along the station. - I'm fine by myself. - Why? - Thanks anyway. I'm fine. I know the way. Where to? - This way. - No, that way. What? That? That way. I get it. - Sachi, take her to the station. - I can now find the way. It's in this direction. Thank you so much. - You know the way? - I do. Thank you. Thanks. See you. - Take care. - Be safe. Takeshi, you should come home some time. Well. See you. Please take care. - See you. - Bye now. Watch your step. Has she gone? - Crying? - No. - Crying again? - It was different that time. How about there? Or else? It's fine here. Any salt? I have some. They gave us some. They did but... Where is it? Maybe it's in the car. Let's go back. It should be fine. No. We need salt. Do you need some salt? Salt? Oh, salt. - Is it all right? - Excuse me. Come in, please. Oh, thank you. Coffee, please. Do you want it hot? Yes, please. What kind of herb teas do you have? We have, chamomile, lemongrass, and cinnamon-cardamom flavors. Lemongrass, please. Coming right up. You always have iced coffee. Excuse me. Sorry but can I change it to iced coffee? - Fine. - Sorry. I'm sorry for the trouble. Are you ready? - I can take care of the kitchen. - Is it OK? I am quite nervous. - Sorry. - No. I'm a bit rusty. Just relax and perform. - Go ahead, please. - OK. I'm all set. Let's start. The characters... Which characters will you choose? Shall I ask them if they have any favorite ones? Are there any? Favorite characters... Do you have any? Lots of them. Anything you like. It's "Wind," perhaps. "Wind"? "Wind"? "Wind." "Wind, forest, fire, mountain" - Excuse me. - Yes. What would you do with it? - This? - Yes. Let's see. Nothing specific. Can I have it? Oh, um, I will pay for it. Please wait for a while. OK. You can have it. Can I? It's still wet so... Could you wait until it dries out? Thank you so much. I'm so happy. Be my guest. Great. - You nailed it. - I have it. I've been looking around. - What's up? - I've been waiting. Let's go home together. A jet coaster. - I wanna ride. - What? That's Fujikyu Highland. What's Fujikyu? An amusement park. Wanna stop by? - OK? - Yup. Great! Looking cool. Wait a sec. Foggy? Yeah, wipe it. - Towel! - Towel? - It's a wipe cloth. - OK. - Fine. - Oh, it looks good. - Is it good? - It is. - Can I ride? - Sure. The kickstand isn't up. - What? - The kickstand. Is it? Ready? Wow! Here you go. Oh, thanks. Is tea OK with you? Yeah. Thanks. Do you come here often? I see. Uncle Takeshi. I'm all right now. See? I see. Sorry to keep you waiting. You stay there. - Here. - Thank you. Only water is left there. I appreciate water now. How did you feel? I enjoyed it. It was good, wasn't it? Thank you. For inviting me. Not at all. - There was nothing. - Right. - It was empty. - A fresh experience. Well... Hidaka-san's... Excuse me. Sorry. May I? Yes. Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. I came here empty-handed. Thanks for the tea. It's good. He left the furniture. He did. The recorder... Can I touch it? Go ahead. Can I play this? Oops, sorry. I just had to play it. Sorry. My apologies. I found it in the closet. Excuse me. Can I look in the closet? Sure. There you go. - Sorry. - No. Go ahead. Oh, sorry. Was it loud? No. Sorry. I fell asleep. Excuse me. I couldn't learn to play the guitar at all. Hidaka-san gave this to me to try learning. But I failed. I like chorus. So he suggested I learn to play this with a song he wrote. Wonderful. I want to hear that song. No, no, no. I can't sing it to others. I'm quite bad. I think it must be special. I will sing it for you since you are being so kind. Excellent. Sacchan, the blue dress... The blue dress and smiling face Look good on you I know what is inside you It's your tenderness Sacchan, the dawn and sunset Look good on you I know what is inside you It's your loneliness Great. Thank you. I'm humbled. It is so special. Good song. Yes. Sacchan The blue dress And smiling face Look good on you I know what is inside you It's your tenderness I was totally at a loss in Shinjuku on the way here. I couldn't find the right exit at the station among all of them. - It's hard there. - It was. Both Shibuya and Shinjuku are difficult in Tokyo. - Even for the residents. - Right. I see. No wonder it is hard for me. Back home, there's no subway. Oh, good. - Sorry for your time. Thanks. - Fine. See you. I asked her a lot about the directions. - It's good to have you here. - I'm finally here. - She saved me. - What do you have? - Cakes. - Cakes? Wonderful. I wanted to have some. - I thought you'd come that way. - You did? I came from this route. This. You brought it here. No, I didn't. The former resident's. Right. There's no name. Coincidence? Wow. What? Let's eat. Oh? Wasn't there another? Thank you. Let's eat it, too. That? I couldn't help getting it. Let's share it. Yes. I'll get it. I just sent it. I don't understand, but I feel it. I see. Can I read it? Thanks. Hey, what's with the dish? How come it's so big? It's just what I got there. - Is it? - Yes. - Shall I buy you a dish? - Seriously? Great. Let's have this. - They look so good. - Yes, they do. - All of them. - Right. - You want that, right? - I do. - How'd you know? - It's right in front of you. You wanted this? - A little. But fine. - Really? - Tasty? Really good. - Really. - Definitely decent. - What are you saying? It's good. Really good. - Thanks. - I found them. Isn't the container big? - Isn't it? - There you go. It's fine. I'll open this. Now... Can I begin? Are you sure? Oh, wait. Let's play it. The remnant. The recorder. Let's play it along. Seriously? Seriously. Let's do everything we can for this. OK. "Returned: Address Unknown" "To Haruhara" Thank you. That way. Let's eat these on the train. Is that her? Oh, that's her. Sachi! There she is. It's Shoko. Didn't you sleep on the trip? We did a lot. She fell asleep again? It's Takikawa when she wakes up. She wanted to eat at Iwase. Um, what? You don't know. OK. Let's stop by there. Great. What? No worries. No worries? Oh, I see. Iwase. OK. Let's stop by Iwase. Thank you for paying for everything. Oh? Oh. Thank you. Oh? Oh.
