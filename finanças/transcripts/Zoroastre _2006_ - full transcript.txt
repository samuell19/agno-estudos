For happy Abramane, at last, all is favourable The people, dismayed at this awful destruction Await the ruling of the gods about the succession to the throne Make them declare themselves in favour of Érinice It is done. Now may Amélite moan in her turn No, I cannot punish enough a heartless woman who insults me Am I to languish in hateful shackles? Zoroastre is loved - hatred is my lot No, I cannot punish enough a heartless woman who insults me Ungrateful Amélite It is time for my rage To pay you back for all the ills you have made me suffer No, I cannot punish enough a heartless woman who insults me Our gods and the people have banished forever The bold chief of a hostile sect The king who was seduced by the errors of the blasphemer In the prime of his life has just passed away Nothing can disturb the course of your life If you overcome love Zoroastre is banished, he is in flight - but he still breathes Our gods, jealous of their glory Have avenged their altars, which they owe only to you Is this exile enough for the horror he inspires in me? Can he escape from your blows? The strength of your magic is invincible The authority that Ariman placed in your hands Is the fearful reflection of his vast power You have brought the humans to his feet This dazzling power no longer touches my soul The lure of a throne is flattering My greatness only lacks this possession My ambition, which is irritated and excited Constantly comes up against the desires of my heart Can I count on Érinice? Zopire, she was to meet me here Here she is My offices have seen to your wishes If you do not have love, may glory unite you Sacrifice everything for happiness Princess, along with Phaerés, tyranny is dead His eyes were covered with a fatal blindfold And our gods that he thought to destroy Have taken him slowly into the darkness of the grave To see our people happy is what I aspire to Amélite is of blood which gave us kings But Érinice, like her, has a claim to the throne And the gods, to settle the fate of this empire Will soon speak through me I hear you To rule, speak What must we do? Bind ourselves together forever Reason, more than anger, extinguishes the passion I used to burn with I give thanks to love, and its requirement is clear to me It wanted to inspire in me the desire to please you To reserve you a throne and to avenge your charms The trouble you take to excuse yourself is pointless Leave this frivolous distraction with me I know you - you in your turn will know me I feel for Zoroastre An unrequited affection The hope of revenge stifles it forever Let us reign and think of the transports of love Only to serve those of hate Let us unite our anger Let us taste the sweetness Of a dazzling revenge I will see the tears of my trembling rival flow I will enjoy the impotent rage of a jealous enemy beset by misfortunes Let us unite our anger Let us taste the sweetness Of a dazzling revenge The ungrateful woman was taking away the hearts of the people of Bactria By the fright of a sudden storm, my magic halted the impetuous zeal Of a timid and fickle people Let us hasten May the gods declare themselves for me That is my price If you make me reign, I swear that with you I will share my crown Frightful gods, all-powerful gods Cast lightning on my head if I betray my oath Frightful gods, powerful gods, cast lightning on my head Burst forth, hurry to reduce me to ashes, if I betray my oath I hesitate no more Let this gift be the surety of the sacred tie which binds us Someone is coming. Let us leave here Amélite may choose to spurn me and insult me I give to you a power equal to my strength I am sufficiently avenged if she sees that That is sufficient You see to the gods, I will see to your vengeance Be reassured, sweet Amélite See our games, listen to us Let the worry which disturbs you make way for the gentlest hope Be reassured, sweet Amélite See our games, listen to us Are you no longer sensitive to all our tender care? Will it never be able to soften your pain? Céphie! Be hopeful and put an end to your weeping Can heaven be unbending in the face of virtue? It is often a more peaceful fate That its rigours prepare for it Come back, it is love that calls you Dear lover, come and reign over your subjects And over the most faithful heart Come back, it is love that calls you Dear lover, it is love that calls you Brave the murderous rage of your barbaric enemies Calm for your return Both my mortal terror And the troubles that you complain of Come back, it is love that calls you Dear lover, come and reign over your subjects And over the most faithful heart Come back, it is love that calls you Dear lover, it is love that calls you For a heart which implores it Love has no endless hardships The loving tears Shed by the dawn Soon bring about the opening Of the most beautiful flowers Dear Zoroastre, alas! What a fate is ours! Does your heart at least think of me? God! What if he sighed for another When I live only for you? No, no, a fickle passion cannot steal my lover from me Our hearts, guided by their fondness, have chosen each other as their lot Sweet love, this delightful accord was the work ofjust one of your darts No, no, a fickle passion cannot steal my lover from me The sun's rays grow pale The ground shakes, the daylight flees To the noise that resounds in the air The shouts of the echoes are added What terrible darkness! Is it you, dear Érinice? Worried as I am, your danger increases my terror Let us flee from this horrific place Come, I fear for you as much as for myself This is no longer the time for pretending Learn what is to be your fate And tremble, knowing my hatred and my power What am I hearing? Whence come such cruel feelings? Keep your distance, or fear my revenge You have to fear torments more dreadful than death Alas! Everything flees from me, I am abandoned Your happiness goes away and their flight surprises you? Come, cruel spirits, subject to my power Abramane commands and my voice calls to you Come, cause terror and despair to prevail around her forever Gods, protectors of innocence Just gods, take my part! Tremble, tremble Fly from us In vain innocence cries out Hell is not listening to her It pursues her in life, it avenges her after death To my sad eyes in this pleasant empire Ever-new games make their charms gleam Alas! Nothing can soften my regrets My heart is troubled And I sigh In the bosom of peace itself Kind woman, worthy of the most tender love Without you, I live no more My soul is with you Against a thousand deadly worries Which take hold of me Pleasure, which follows me, wants in vain to protect me May I listen to it, give myself up to it, expect it only in the places where I see you ? Kind woman, worthy of the most tender love Without you, I live no more My soul is with you In this pleasant refuge you have experienced only untroubled days But the earth is groaning, a merciless monster Makes the humans tremble under an iron sceptre Doubtless Abramane is this ruthless monster You must prepare your heart for the most cruel setback I tremble Amélite? - You must break her shackles - Her shackles! Is she in the power of a barbarian? And this immense distance separates me from such a dear person! Over the charm of pleasures And the weight of setbacks I have seen your constancy triumph Go and take the defence of heaven, which was testing you Zoroastre, it is time to liberate the universe But her life...? Forgive my extreme fondness Alas! A thousand times, without fear, I have seen danger, even death I have never feared for myself And I fear everything For the one I love The sovereign arbiter of the earth and the heavens Wants to cause a brilliant ray to shine in your eyes Of his immortal glory If nothing can weary your constancy and your zeal See what must one day be your glorious destiny Spirits of fire Of the air Of the earth And of the deep Fly, fly, hurry, all of you At the sound of my voice, heavens, O heavens, open Hear our wishes, master of the world Let the deep darkness of fate and time Destroy itself before us Where am I? A new light shows me the way What enchanting perfumes! What melodious sounds! I penetrate the mystery of the eternal secrets My soul is flying In the heavens Zoroastre flies to glory! Triumph, light up the universe Take victory with you on your path Give chains to hell Assist the fervour which pushes me on, open up the road and I'll go Redouble your constancy Your life depends on it It will take only a moment of weakness for you to be lost Can I fear a tyrant I have always defied? It is a gift from heaven whose supreme goodness Knows so well how to match the assistance to the danger Adversity has its term and must run its course It ends as soon as it becomes extreme This delays me too much Under the weight of her shackles, Amélite groans and perhaps collapses May the order and peace brought to the universe Make the humans love a father in their master Go! Leave! Desire where you want to be! Sweet Amélite Alas! In vain innocence cries out, hell is not listening to her It pursues her in life It avenges her after death Great heaven, what savagery! Will you always follow me? Stop This is your last remaining instant Renounce the throne, or die I defy your power Strike I fear the most terrible death much less than the horror of seeing you That's too much. Expire Barbarian! Zoroastre? Oh! Gods! Dear lover If love had not seen fit to bring you here I would no longer enjoy the light of the heavens What becomes of me? My arm, unfaithful to my hatred, spoils my crime and leaves her alive Awful moment! Fateful return! She will live for you You live only for her In the excess of my rage, in my mortal grief Know at least, ingrate, the excess of my love Cruel woman! I shudder What does she dare to tell me? All my senses are frozen in horror Heaven? What love! I see what I must look forward to I can read in your looks my shame and her happiness It is too much and only the hope of extreme revenge Can soften my unhappiness In my fury I will mix up that which I hate and that which I love Tremble To make equal her sorrow and my grief Before I stab her through the heart I will dare to sacrifice you yourself In my fury I will mix up that which I hate and that which I love Alas! I faced her wrath I suffered the harshest blows Without flinching, without complaining In the end the savage woman forced me to be afraid of her By making me fear for you I see the violence of her fury But your life is safe What can her vengeance do against me? Against the anger of hell, what will be your defence? The authority which for you has just overcome her power Will give back purity to the daylight, which she darkened I see you again I feel no more alarm At last I gain the recompense for my fond sighs Love, which returns you to my tears In your eyes spreads all its charms And in my heart all its pleasures I heed only my deep affection I have regained everything I love I am losing the memory of the ills I have suffered I will rush to put them right The splendour of the supreme rank Will soon wipe out the disgrace of your shackles Is it for an empire that my soul sighs? You know, love fills it with its fire To see you at all times To love you To tell you so That is the only possession That can fulfil my wishes You enchant my senses You delight my soul How easily one forgets oneself in the arms of love! Duty calls me in its turn In heeding its call I serve both my glory and my love Abode impenetrable to the light of the heavens Terrible places, cease to enslave innocence Walls erected by vengeance Collapse and fall, hateful walls Heaven, touched by my tears and your zeal Gives you back the only person worthy of your choice The blow was about to fall and you would have lost in her All the noble blood of your kings Burst out, outpouring of rejoicing, shine in our songs and our games Let us celebrate the happy moment which returns you to our love Absence is a cruel torment! But how sweet it is to see again the one we love Everything grows more lovely when a loved one returns Everything takes on the supreme charm of pleasure or of feeling Without him the most pleasant day Is darker Than night itself Absence is a cruel torment! But how sweet it is to see again the one we love No, it is not always to devastate the land That the winds stir up the air The sky, without casting thunder Often makes lightning flash If love tests a sincere heart for a time And seems to make heavier its shackles The heart may sigh But let it hope Happiness sometimes Is born from the womb of reversals No, it is not always to devastate the land That the winds stir up the air The sky, without casting thunder Often makes lightning flash Stop fearing criminal priests Give up cruel gods who strike when you pray to them May a sparkling celebration, as the dawn breaks Reward the passion of all fond hearts Let only love offer our wishes to the benevolent god that I adore May he triumph over the other gods The day which is about to shine on us is a day of victory May it gather us together on its return Dear Zoroastre Love wishes to crown its glory Fond lovers, form the most beautiful ties Sing, sing Our sorrows are over May the sweetest pleasures return Zoroastre, be happy Form the most beautiful ties Fond lovers, be happy Sing, sing Our sorrows are over May the sweetest pleasures return Stop. Curb this extreme anger The slightest outburst might put off the enemy who is offering himself To my blows Let my hatred act and leave this river bank Is it here that they are to wed? I await him in the trap where his love has brought him His tomb is being prepared and my magic will open it It is for me to punish him So he thinks to consummate his crime and my insult? The people appear united in his favour I will disperse this storm But you could have prevented it O unhappy memory! My rival triumphs, she escapes my rage O gods! What does the life or death of a weak rival matter to our designs? You should have settled our destinies for good by striking the object of a fatal love Ingrate! When I saw him appear, the dagger fell from my hands If you see him, in spite of his contempt Will love be less the master? No, everything serves to rekindle the bitter disappointment that devours me Love can no longer quell it Gods! He has been charmed by another He flees from me, the cruel man He hates me I loathe him Against him what can't I arm? Everything which sees the light of day from sunset to dawn No, everything serves to rekindle the bitter disappointment that devours me Love can no longer quell it A proud heart which breaks its chains will find a happy calm with freedom Your soul is torn apart, a futile disappointment draws it away Can I take for hatred the cries of angry love? We must help your weakness These moments are too precious to risk Here let your power cease And let a thick cloud hide you from the eyes of all The traitor! Let us dare to commit great crimes I expect a glorious prize Their name changes if they are profitable, all success is legitimate Great enemy of my gods, death surrounds you here Revenge has dug a thousand pits beneath your feet And you whom I adored You hateful people, you defy my power Be the victims of it Let us dare to commit great crimes I expect a glorious prize Their name changes if they are profitable All success is legitimate Daylight will assemble these inconstant people I'll wait in these woods for the moment to appear I must with startling deeds affirm a power that they dare to disregard Slumber, leave this place For the most wonderful celebration the voice of love calls us Let us fly to the voice of love The rosy dawn hurries to return The gentle birds who are woken announce the day with their singing Slumber, leave this place For the most wonderful celebration the voice of love calls us Let us fly to the voice of love Of our mutual passion Marriage will forever ensure the happiness Love, which kindled it to make it eternal Offers a new charm to my heart In the duty of being faithful to you The most beautiful ties are being prepared for us Love must form them, happiness will follow them How sweet will be my destiny!

What a crash of thunder! Heavens! The daylight flees I feel the ground shaking Gods, arm yourselves Strengthen my arm Flow, torrents of fire To avenge their affront Proud north winds in these climes, carry terror, devastation And make death fly Ah? Cruel! I am dying Gods! Let us all flee! Amélite She is dying. O heaven! We perish I run to protect you Open these dying eyes to the cries of my pain When I fear for your life what could I undertake? Courage flies from my heart Your eyes These beautiful eyes alone can give it back to me Where am I? What power What loving voice Has halted my dying soul? It is you that love offers again to my heart I see you again I can die happy Come, spirits of peace Hurry to this place We perish A furious tyrant sends after them Death and horror I must either save them Or perish with them Gentle Amélite Dear lover Farewell Take care of her Keep her safe from the perils I am running to Cruel tyrants who reign in my heart Merciless hate, implacable vengeance Spare me the horror of insatiable remorse Or yield to its attack At the bottom of my soul An unwelcome passion is irritated by my resistance To reproach me for my anger Wrongdoing unites its voice with the cries of innocence Of the abyss where I am sinking I can see the depth Everything frightens me and harms me Everything, including my power Spreads around me trouble and misfortune Cruel tyrants who reign in my heart Merciless hate, implacable vengeance Spare me the horror of insatiable remorse Or yield to its attack Your enemy triumphs and moments are costly He has escaped from the extreme dangers that hell sent against his courage Our soldiers acting on your supreme orders ran to put him in chains His voice burst out in the air Immediately they turned their weapons against themselves Gods of Abramane, vengeful gods What power can stop your fury? The bright, pure light of the calmest day Has dispersed the horror of your spells The winds are chained up The flowers and vegetation in our desolate fields Bring back the spring It is over then, traitor, there is no more hope I am bound for all time to your crimes And I lose forever my glory and my vengeance Must a moment's setback shake you? You know what my power is Should you be trembling? Summon up your courage A shameful despair is the lot only of powerless unfortunates What can I still hope for? Amélite lives and your rival adores her How the sight of them caused torment in my heart! They were so much in love and so happy! What sweetness they tasted in tightening their bonds! Stop. Why do you recall, heartless woman The awful memory of these cruel moments? O gods! What mortal pain! Love and happiness Shone in their eyes Zoroastre was so happy! Amélite was so beautiful! I see with horror the light of day What torture! What pain! To feel a heart made for love rip apart Through the anger of an uncompromising hatred Hatred which can act is always powerful enough The treasures of my art will show themselves to your eyes Danger diminishes when courage increases Hatred which can act is always powerful enough Let double doors of bronze render this temple impenetrable to our enemies Érinice, dare to see with an untroubled brow the secret mysteries of a fearsome cult Supreme author of evil and of sad reversals Which desolate land and the sea O you, who by diverse names I have made known to the universe As the absolute master of the world Your glory is being attacked Strengthen your vengeful arm Make the flames of thunder burn brightly in the air Burst forth! Take your revenge! It is but to terror that you owe the world's adulation Your glory is being attacked Strengthen your vengeful arm Make the flames of thunder burn brightly in the air Burst forth! Take your revenge! It is but to terror that you owe the world's adulation Let us drain our sad victims Fearsome Ariman, feed your just fury In streams of blood Princess, everything indicates to me an invincible aid And I never saw more favourable signs Let us unite our voices And let a terrible spell ensure again the success of our wishes Feared ministers of the most powerful empire, of mortals, of gods Enemies of yourselves You, spirits that only the desire to harm can force to be happy Fly, fly, cruel band, give free flight To all your fury Affronted love calls to you Come running to its voice Implacable avengers At your call we willingly leave the eternal darkness Hatred leads us, Vengeance follows us The goods that our hand dispenses are sweeter than you think We offer as help, in their harsh trials Vengeance to affronted hearts and death to the unhappy Take revenge, suffer no more The more striking an insult The sweeter it is to punish it Hatred likes to take pleasure In slow revenge But when the moment arises, you cannot seize it too soon Take revenge, suffer no more The more striking an insult, the sweeter it is to punish it I think I see already my bloody rival Stagger, fall and die Let us strike the most terrible blows Let us sacrifice two ingrates, let us strike them by turns In sensitive hearts hatred is extreme, like love Go, hurry! I'll put a weapon in your hands, heed only rage By the most deadly outbursts show your courage Let fury guide your arm Let fire, let havoc precede and follow your passing Brave the most awful death, cause carnage everywhere For hearts that do not take revenge disgrace is always theirs Honour speaks - fight Die, if you must, but avenge your affront Vengeance has such sweetness! An unknown pleasure flows with your fury to the bottom of my soul Love has fewer charms than the fervour which fires me Vengeance has such sweetness! Let your enemy's punishment begin Let him feel he is beaten by invisible blows Fly, support my power Cruel spirits, jealous spirits Make vengeance triumph The fire consumes him! What sweeter hope What good fortune! Hell is assisting us May its fires set the skies alight May they devour the earth and the waters The greatest ills are our dearest possessions Hell is assisting us, let everything be confounded Our anger is not in vain The underground vaults of the empire of the dead Seem to be collapsing at these terrible sounds They are increasing Hell will speak Let us listen Take up your arms. Offer up to hell crimes worthy of its rage Make virtue tremble Make courage grow pale A startling reversal is about to change the universe Take up your arms Victory is yours Nothing can trouble you For you, what glory! Everything will tremble Blood will flow, people will be sacrificed. Triumph, victory! Noise, destruction, death, carnage are our pleasures Fury and rage are but the image of our desires For you, what glory! Everything will tremble People will be sacrificed, blood will flow. Triumph, victory! What torment! Where can I find trace of him? Might a barbarian have satisfied his fury? I tremble Zoroastre, alas! Unhappy woman! Should I be trembling for his life? Love Cruel love! Your fatal blindfold hides from our eyes the abyss where your hand drags us All the links in your chain are already formed When you set your torch aflame My heart gets angry in vain Its fondness restores it It is an ever-new battle And I see both love and hate in turn Take up weapons for my execution And dig my grave Love Cruel love Your fatal blindfold hides from our eyes the abyss where your hand drags us All the links in your chain are already formed When you set your torch aflame He is approaching At last I can breathe It is Érinice. O heaven! Respect my pain And conceal at least the horror that I inspire in you Fear no more my fury Your life is under threat, all my anger expires If a traitor takes up arms against me, does he think to make me tremble? Death has never inspired fear in me. If you fear it, you deserve to die Fear our furious priests Their cruelty, their shouts, their odious plots Are recalled constantly to my desperate heart Leave, flee, time is short Abramane has hell and the gods on his side I defy the gods of a barbarian, I hate their villainous priests And on the wreckage of their bloody altars my triumph will be prepared. Alas! Your confidence increases my terror You must know the fearsome power of a fatal magic In a terrible spell Dreadful Myself, who adores you While shuddering in horror I experienced feelings of guilt The rage, the fury of pitiless hell Reached the bottom of my heart in spite of me O awful mysteries of a detestable cult! Cruel woman! Do you not fear? I fear only your death You see the despair to which my soul has given itself up Be moved by my weeping, flee from this terrible place My misfortunes Your scorn My death which will follow I forgive you for everything Ungrateful man If you want to live And this is the only price that my love demands What do I hear? O heaven! It is a faithful people who allow their joy in Amélite to burst forth Judge our feelings against you and for her By her virtues and your remorse My remorse! This reproach silences its murmuring Our fate is to hate each other My heart needed this new insult To force it to obey me She runs from chasm to chasm, seeking the peace which has left her Such is the rightful fate of wrongdoing Trouble surrounds it and disgrace follows it The people in this place, according to ancient custom Must pay homage to the kings they have chosen They are bringing Amélite and coming to assemble here Gods, O gods! What a terrible blow! Heaven! What new misfortune comes to torment me? Fatal day! Implacable fate! Céphie What is the reason for your weeping? In the midst of her people and charming all hearts Amélite was brought to the throne in this place Along paths strewn with flowers All of a sudden, the air was stirred up A whirlwind of fire rushed between her and us And, quicker than lightning, snatched her from us What will become of me? Amélite? O cruel misfortune! What purpose does my immense power serve now? What good is life to me without her? O heaven, what shameful despair! May proud Érinice triumph and reign in this place Let all give way! Let all bow down! Tremblingly adore the choice made by the gods Traitor! Your punishment has been delayed too long Stop. I know your hateful power If by a gesture, a word, your fear or your vengeance Dares to beg for heaven's help Amélite is in my power Tremble, tremble! I will sacrifice her before your eyes What a dreadful moment for the most loving heart! I feel myself giving way before this awful setback No, no, heaven is just, it will protect her And I at least will be able to die if I should lose her Fall, monsters, fall into the bottom of hell With one final setback worthy of your courage Heaven wanted to test your virtue again Zoroastre, while watching over your greatest work I was keeping the prize which is due to you Reign in these climes where peace will be reborn These people are dear to you, answer their wishes The love of the subjects and of the master Makes the only rightful kings Powerful empires and happy reigns Unite these lovers with the most pleasing ties How charming are these ties! How they delight my love! - How I love you! - Sweet return! All my soul is for love - May love bind it! - May love set it ablaze! May love bind it Forever! May love set it ablaze Everlastingly!
