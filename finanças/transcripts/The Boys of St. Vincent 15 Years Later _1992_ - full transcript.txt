You can't force me to do that. Yes I Can. Do you recognize that? I accused Peter John Lavin for various crimes. Partly based in your testimony here. I intend to take you to court and you will have to tell the judge if that is your signature. After what the wretch did with you, won't you want to catch it? I do not believe. Send me another paper as this one and I disappear, understand? I will not go to court. Peter John Lavin was arrested today under the accusation of physical and sexual aggression. The crimes were allegedly committed against the boys from the orphanage, 15 years ago. Former Father Lavin was visibly popular in the community during his inauguration. It was his credits for its dynamic strength ago expansion of the orphanage facilities... including the building for the hockey games of São Vicente, champion site of the city. Mr. Lavin lives in Montreal, he is married and has two children. Kevin, my little baby. I love you, son. As I was saying before, Brother Lavin... How did you say? I'm sorry. Mr. Lavin. Now let me explain the options guilty or innocent allegation. It doesn't matter, I'm innocent. How much is it? How? The cost, man, the cost. I have a family, remember? Your taxes guarantee this. I thought you knew. Now, I feel, we have to return the question of the claim. Listen, I'm innocent. I taught discipline. I tried to turn boys responsible people. Now, as soon as you understand this, better for both of us, was it clear? Yes of course. What do you think, listeners? Now the old are back superintendent Lavin, Fathers Glackin and Glynn, caught at once. Accused of countless crimes against little boys. Helpless orphans delivered in your care. Have you heard the news. What do you think? VOCP, the voice of all people are in the air. Call us. Line 2 is in the air. Good morning, Leonora. My God, Gladys. But it's great to hear from you. Does a long time that we don't talk. You gone. Where have you been? I went to visit my daughter in Toronto. Yeah, that's good for you. Yeah, I came back here yesterday. And you can imagine my fright. And now what I wanted to tell you... I am a devout religious and very faithful, my whole life. And God loves you for that, You heard, Gladys. Well, thank you, Leonora. Now, as I was saying, I don't believe in any of that. You didn't fall for that then? No. Why don't we remember of all good men of our community that were saved by the priests? Yeah, yeah. Look, I'm going to tell you Leonora. I am furious about that. There are so many people just looking for a reason to be able to finish with our Mother Church. Well, I hope be right, Gladys. God knows we hope that is right. Some policemen confirmed the existence of witness reports signed with date of the 70s. They are part of a criminal investigation of mistreatment of boys by all the priests of São Vicente. Peter John Lavin, former superintendent alleges innocence in the charges of physical and sexual violence. One of the aggravating factors mysteries of this case is why no accusations were made at the time of the original investigation? A preliminary inquiry is the next step in the procedures cool when they will present evidence that are convincing. It's open. It's open. Wanna talk about it? Hello Kevin. How are you? Very well, detective. Very well. I heard that you do not want to go testify. And you heard well. Look, I have nothing to tell you. Listen, Kevin, you will not have another chance. If you don't testify Lavin leaves free. Well, he never will be accused. Think about it. Think about it? Do you want to know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking how can one great man and great detective do that with a child. You said that he would come back to see me. And I came back. Oh, of course. I'm saying I came back. You were already gone move in with your uncle. I don't have an uncle. That's what they told me. Who told you that? One of the priests. And did you believe? I stayed there until I was 16. For God's sake! Say, Mr. Noseworthy, this is the Kevin Reevey's signature, isn't it? Yes sir. He signed in my presence as you can see in the signature below. Could you read that story, please? The piece marked at the end. "He made me sit on his lap. Sometimes he took my shirt off, and other times I took all my clothes... and he kissed me and smoothed it my private parts. "The man who did this to me, was Father Lavin." No more questions, Your Honor. Well, that witness's account is 15 years ago. Is correct? That's right. And in this case was any arrest made? No, but it should have been. But it was not. Your Honor, there was no charge when that case was opened. Our legal system in your wisdom probably determined that there was not enough evidence. What kind of system judiciary is this that does not leave an officer show the doctor's evidence? What do you mean "doctor's evidence?" The boss sent me rewrite my report... - excluding references sexual abuse - excluding references sexual abuse So that there was no elements for accusations. He said the orders came of the Justice Department. I said that a bunch of politicians criminals and the dome of the Church had conspired to detain the natural course of justice. And why are they only talking about it now? I was told I would be fired and accused by justice if I said anything. Are you saying that not only don't there was evidence against the priests as there was also coverage of that? That was exactly it, and you can wait. They will go after the priests, I believe that. They will be brought to the court, yes. But what about the big guys? Just wait. They will leave that somehow. Who are the senators? What will happen now? It will be possible, people. Is it possible that the police and government senators... or even the government ministers knew what was happening in the orphanage and covered up everything? Well, now there will be a committee of inquiry and that it will be open to the public. Will they go through with it? What do you think? The boys were in truth under the custody of the state... and that guard was given to the priests orphanage by your department. Is correct? Yea. And what was your responsibility? I was the assistant responsible social for all contacts between the department and the orphanage. And how many times did you visit the boys? Never. They made it clear to me that I couldn't interfere in São Vicente in no way. Who ordered this? It came from the directors' rooms. I understand. I'll check it out, okay? It's the first time in Newfoundland? Do not. Are you on business then? Yeah, let's say yes. And for a lot of fun too. I wait. Speaking of which, you know if there is a lot of dust around here? If there is something difficult to predict in this city, it's what the weather will be like. No, no, no. Crystal. It is dust, dust of the good. Last month, sir. There was a lot of that nearby. Near here, don't you joke? Yes, I did, sir. And did you have enough? Every kind. Brian. Jesus Christ. Good to see you, man. You are hungry? Order what you want. Waiter, bring us champagne. Let's celebrate, me and my brother here. Sit down. So how are you? Married to children? I want to meet your wife, but I thought it was better, you know, we see each other first and... Do you know. Good... How is it? Are you hungry? Waiter, bring him a menu. What place, huh? IT IS. Jesus Christ. You look good to me. You're losing hair, huh? Why are you here? Just spend a few million. No. Trying to find the guys, find a good one. Waiter, thank you. Old days. My God. It came in through the nose. What are you doing here, bro? The cops invited me that I couldn't refuse, you know. Free travel, a good hotel, enjoy my brother. What they want is to talk about Glackin. I tried to find you. You tried, and when was that? I stayed in that damn place a few years waiting. I can not wait to go to Toronto. Don't get too excited, bro. It will take a while, you know. Yeah, I know, but I I'm going one day, aren't I? Do you think I would leave you in that damn place? Not even. As soon as I get ready, you come. You will be fine. Just stay away from them, that's all. Forget it, OK. What will you want? Waiter, where's the menu? No, okay, I already ate. Cigarette? I do not smoke. Jesus, a clean life. Do you live in the suburbs? I knew you'd ask that. Do you have photos of your wife, the children? It's what I have, nephew niece? Do not tell me. Let me see the photo. These are the children. Cool. And Donna is in this one. Look, a family. Cool. Records show that complaints of sexual and physical abuse were sent to you, can you confirm that? Well... I can. Did something about these complaints? Yes, actually I did. Can you tell the committee what your department did in that regard? I think I asked Father Lavin to investigate and report to me. Wait a minute. You were the legal guardian of these boys, is that correct? Well... that's correct. And you're saying to that commission that as their guardian with the obligation to care their wellbeing... you asked a of the accused priests to investigate a crime that he himself committed? Well, that may seem absurd, but at that time it seemed to be the thing appropriate to do. Passengers attention to Toronto, board the gate... How your family is reacting About that? Will they take it? I will find out when you get there. I would like to put your wife in the bank as the main witness. No way. I do not want my family in it. Well, I tell you that it is in your full interest having people witnessing as to your strength of character. Your mental stability. I said no, didn't I? Well, then I can put it in contact with a psychiatrist? What for? So that we can bring a expert as a witness, so you can say that you have been subjected to a test and tell the court about your psychological balance. Do you want someone to speak to the judge that children are type A... and I type B. Something like that? Something like that. Someone who knows mine deeper thoughts, right? Excellent. Great. I will schedule some sessions to start when you get back. As you wish. Then he arrived, and then he knows what he did? He took my skates. He sat in front of me and he took off my skates. Daddy... Hi, children. How are you? Well. I thought that I wouldn't see you anymore. I'm very sorry. You must be hungry, right? Well... How about baked potatoes? What do you think? I'll be ready in no time. Daddy! Very well, children. Has a thing in the suitcase for you two. It has the name of each one. So no fights, okay? You're Reevey, aren't you? Kevin Reevey, right? Glen Martin. From room Glackins, remember? Yes I remember. Give me four beers? They called me because of my testimony. Now we take that Glackin. I saw some of the boys and asked for you. What have you done? Little thing. I'm working in Texas and earning a lot of money. I bet it has spicy stories to tell, Kevin. Man, as I remember you were going almost every day in Lavin's office. Of course it was his little boy. Remember what they did: "Hey, Lavin. What do you say, Lavin?" Do you think this is funny? Do you think this is a joke? Kevin... You were at São Vicente, haven't you? He said that you it was Lavin's boy. Come on, Kevin. It's in all the newspapers. I know who Lavin was. Maybe it's better that we take a break. What? See if you take care of yourself, okay? Kevin, Kevin, hey, hey! Come on, come on, come on! No, I don't want to go back there, please. Let's start by talking about you. Some particular aspect who wanted to know about me? Yes, yes, well... i will say what I want. No need to feel that I am wanting to take you to a place you don't want to. Right? Take me wherever you want. Well what happened to you now, has a certain meaning. And you can tell me about it... if we put this current experience in the total perspective of your life. I do not... I did not met my real parents and... I lived some time at the Foster home. Three... During the period three to nine years. And you never lived somewhere else? No, I went to an orphanage after the Foster house. But no, I didn't live nowhere else not. I don't think it hurt me. I particulary I didn't feel bad about it. It made me strong. I didn't have the privilege of... having my blanket and not even the boys who lived with me. You know, they grow up to be very kind... and helpless. And you grew up to be tough? No, I grew up to understand life as it is. A true life, not some thing you could fantasize about. And go to church, then what they did to us? Yeah, I came back. After I started to go out with Donna. You should have seen me. The first time I entered a church after he leaves the orphanage. I felt, you know, and the priest was in front of me. I was praying that part of the Our Father, the one that says "forgive our sins" so with us we forgive our sinners. ” You can't, Brian. Exactly what I thought. Forgive those bastards, not even. I got up and quickly leave the church. I thought you were going to be sick. I was full, full of hate. - I wanted to kill them all. - I wanted to kill them all. Nothing would be so bad or so painful for priests, if you want to know. I know that. Then I started to think what I would do if you found one of them, Glynn or Lavin? That's right, I would kill them. No doubt. So I tried to go back to the church to settle with Donna. And again that whole thing of forgiveness. And I thought well: maybe I could forgive them. If they were dead. Exactly. Now I can forgive you, motherfucker! But I couldn't forgive them, so I'm the one who would to live with this hatred. But I couldn't do it. I think I started to understand what they were talking about. I don't hate them anymore. Forgive and forget, don't you? No way, bro. The trial of Father James Glackin will have a sensational start today... with the testimony of a young man who claimed to receive visitors in his bed at night by the priest responsible for his room. The longawaited trial of Peter John Lavin... the man who was superintendent when those offenses are likely have occurred, is already underway. At the police station two more former priests were arrested. I told you to be careful. Stop this! ... New witnesses in the case of the trial of the priests of the São Vicente orphanage. Peter, I would like to see you in my room. Just a minute. Perfect. Catherine, I'm going to need everything in my hands this afternoon. I'm going to need a circular proposal, formal proposal and everything. It's temporary, until everything calms down. Listen, it was mine skill that took us to have that contract in first hand. I was the one who left the side family to reconcile the needs of directors with this planning commission. Peter. And I was the one who gave the blood... so that I could in first hand! Enough, Peter. It is suspended from now on. What happens to the innocent until you prove you're guilty? And why the hell am I in it? I do not know! I do not know. Let me explain something to you, in the orphanage both the children... like all of our priests, they started the day early. You always have something to do all day until bedtime. The boys had an hour of rest, or to go to the library, watch TV or swim a little. The older ones could swim. And for all the priests, the day started two hours earlier, it ended two hours later. And everything we did it was for the boys. I mean everything. Collect donations, drive, teach. Will, can I say who loved the boys? Does that describe what you felt? Yea. And then, did you like the bracelet? I liked. Awesome. Stayed. Do you think your father will you let her use it? Will I let you go with her to church? Maybe. I'm not thinking so. Cool, Billy. You will do the following. Will commune... and instead of coming back and come and sit with your parents, again will go back to the queue and commune again. That's what you have to do. I just want to see. I doubt it will. No, no joke. That's what I did. I swear to God. You will get it? Nice. Do you think you can handle this? Clear. Ah cool. And what do you think your parents will you think of that? I do not know. Okay, time to go. No, it's not. I think it is. They are awesome, don't you think? Yeah, hi. You're too much, man. Nice shirt. Thank you very much. You better get going. Put the shirt inside. Cool, Billy. Remember what I told you, huh? The body of Christ. Amen. The body of Christ. Amen. The body of Christ. Amen. The body of Christ. Amen. Cool, one more. One more, what? Look? It is not a hopeless case. Did you know he was going to do that? I didn't even suspect. Now lower your head, bow your head. Nice. Good boy. In 1975, you were Minister of Social Work. Is correct? Is correct. We heard many witnesses here about testimonials that stayed in his department. Can you tell me if you had knowledge of this fact? I'm sorry, but I can't tell you anything. The first time I heard that was last year when they opened the investigation. I never knew about the police investigation? Never. Never heard of testimonials that were in your department itself? Never. I didn't know that most of the orphanage boys was put there by people your department? Of course he knew that. I was told that the boys were happy to be there. I thought the priests doing a good job. Never talked about it with the premier? How could I? I've already told you, I did not know anything. It's open. I missed you. I felt yours too. Calm down, it was just a dream, calm down. It was just a dream. Now mom will give you a big kiss. Are you going to sleep well? Clear. She gives me a kiss here. Sleep well my love. Say good night to Dad. I want to that you sleep well, okay? I want you to sleep very well, right? And in the morning we all go play some hockey. OK. OK. The children arrived at home crying. They said some things for them in high school. What things? What do you think? Peter, I don't know anymore what to think. You never told me about the orphanage. Why didn't you speak? Because it was a total nightmare. There were false accusations like there are accusations now. Was because of this that I left the cassock. You left because of the charges? But... You told me... who left the cassock why did you want to change your life? That's right. But I also said that I couldn't keep the vow of obedience. The most obedience humble and sincere. But there was something wrong during the time what have you been there Yes, there was. My God. Because I be the superintendent... the guilt fell on me. They said they knew everything. Did you know? Peter. I need you, Chantal. Now that you it's my wife, and... in the good and the bad moments, remember? Come on, get some rest. I need you. Don't do this, Peter. Peter, no. Peter... Peter. Can you tell me in detail what you felt for her... the first time you met her? The first time you saw her? Any changes? Tell me how you felt. Safe. She made me feel safe. I think. Yes, there was confidence. There was a reaction on me, you know? There was an attraction, you know. And one thing leads to another. We got married. And then? And then... one years after we had we got married, we decided to have children and then we had two children, two children in a row. Antom was the first and Eric the second. It was an incredible thing having my own children. Because I never had... in a family, you know. And there were those little things that were mine. And they were so... sweets, so... Well, I wanted give them everything... everything... everything I didn't have. Everything... and... Steven! Hi. Come on, man. Open it. OK. Okay? Did I wake you? No, no. I thought I would like to go home. Donna is making spaghetti. And we might as well watch the game, don't you? No, I feel a little weird. You know, I was going to have a beer. Don't you like beer a lot? Look, put it in the account, if you want. No thank you. I'm going to go out. Okay, do what you want. Yeah, I'm going out. Will leave? Yeah, I'm going out. Excellent. And where are you going? I'm going to see some friends. I have some friends, you know. Yeah, I have a few, just a few. Any of your old friends? Yes, listen, look... If so, I need one. Got it. This crap here? Just to rejoice. I know I know. It's just that mine is over. You know, it's difficult, it's really difficult. What is hard? A difficult thing. That's good. It is pretty hard. It's hard to find good, got it? Good. I have to go now. You understand, don't you? You can go home, maybe I'll come by later to catch you, You are a cool guy. We are going home. That's it. I love you man. I really love you. I love you too. Now I have to go. I have to go. Let me out. Let me out! You're not going anywhere. I am going out! It is ok, go ahead, I do not care anymore! Will go around taking drugs with the other guys! Hello. Yeah, it's me. I'm not here, he went around. I don't know where. I do not know. Okay, I'm on my way. See you later. Now, Chief Kennedy, you spoke to Monsignor Fuocco about this problem? As for this problem? I do not think so. I'm not sure. I have problems with my memory. Especially during that time, since I operated. As I said? Well, you understand, I operated on a few years ago. Prostate operation. Since then I have memory problems. 63900:52:22,603... > 00:52:27,208 What about the orders to the exdetective Noseworthy to change... a police report regarding the sexual reference? No ma'am, nothing that I remember. Well, this is unbelievable, isn't it personal? That a man who purposely harmed boys, stay free. A man who admitted to suffering of memory problems... and who was once the department head police in your city. And he says who made an operation and who now can't remember anything. Oh, no, no. Leave us know what you think. We have someone. We have someone on line 2. He can talk, line 2 is in the air. Of course, I don't believe them, Leonora. They're all lying. Why that leads to priests. Everyone says they are not guilty. It's true. Do you know what I think, Leonora? No, but I think that you will tell me. Sex, Leonora, sex. That's why all this happens. The Church does not allow to have sex. Now you have a bunch of priests and leaves them alone with all these boys. Well, what do you expect to happen? Well, you have your opinion formed against that, friend. And thank you very much for telling us. I covered celibacy At that time. Sex terrified me a lot. That was one reason why I went for the Order of Holy Fathers, not to deal with it. Well, what did you feel? Fear. Right. But afraid of what? I do not know. Fear of loving. No, don't miss it what you're feeling, hold on. What are you feeling now? Before I had... a family. Now I have a bunch of enemies. What there was? I fought. You fought, huh? My leg hurts. Well, wait a minute. Did you break any bones? No. It is not? Look, I'm going there. Do you want a ride? I want. Excellent. I wanted to hug you. His neck looked... so soft... it's perfect. I felt alive, Father. I felt excited. I wanted to feel its warmth and its tenderness. I wanted to feel your love. Have you ever played? Have you felt those desires before? It's been a long time. What did you do about those wishes? I have sinned, Father. Did you know that some of the boys had they been abused? Is correct? Yes, and I can say that it was a tremendous shock. What did you do about it? I did not understand? The boys, Monsignor. What did you do about them? As I already said, it's been a long time. None of us knew what we know now about the effects it had. I thought the boys would be much better if they weren't put in embarrassing situations. And is aware of some of the priests who remained at the orphanage after they closed the investigation in 1975... are now being accused of criminal acts of sexual abuse against these boys? Yes I have. And it causes me great pain. What about Father Lavin? What about him? Did you know that the police did you have evidence against him too? He's lying, bastard. He's lying with a clean face! You are a wretch, Monsignor. Why don't you tell them the truth? Come on, we're waiting. Tell the truth. Go to hell, Monsignor. Like all your priests. Go to hell. If there is more some interruption I will close to the public. Proceed, counselor. Now, back to Father Lavin. He also managed to get rid? I wouldn't speak that way. Wasn't that part of the deal? After all 1 million of dollars was at stake. There was no agreement, I can say. Father Lavin needed a deserved rest. Only that. And that was true for the other priests, I was just following instructions. Whose was it following instructions? From Jerome Ward. The interim Minister of Justice. Who died five years ago. Unfortunately. And he didn't speak to anyone else? I did not speak. So the guy died, didn't you, Leonora? Well friend, it seems so, doesn't it? Because he was the only one in the government who was involved in this and nobody else in the government. Nobody remembers any meeting at any time so that these people could remember something needed the interim the Minister of Justice, the deceased, our great Jerome Ward. My dear, if the deceased could speak. Is not it? What a story he would tell. Well, I have to hang up now, friend. Go ahead. Line 2 is in the air. Who are you going to call now, Leonora? That's what I wanted to know. Well, I think you should call ghost hunters. What do you think about this? ROOM 2, CUT Look, you don't have to be afraid. They will do some questions and nothing more. Where are you living now, Steven? In Toronto. Are you employed? What is your job? I'm looking for a job. That was what he did before coming here. Do you live on insurance, Steven? And have you lived in the past few years? Yes, at the moment yes, but... Well, what could I do, I have to eat, don't I? Only the answer, Steven. Do you have a criminal record? Yeah, for a few little things. Home invasion, assault, possession of illegal drugs. Drunk driving. These are not little things, Mr. Lunny. Do you prostitute yourself, Steven? Because I'm seeing here in your record, four arrests for prostitution. Objection, excellence. All right, I will withdraw the question. Steven... you stayed at the orphanage for let's see... six years, correct? I do not know. I'll ask other way. The records show that you left the orphanage at 16, is correct? It is. Excellent. When I was 15 or 16... do you remember a boy called Alfred Langston? I do not know. What about Joseph Cowlen? Jeremy O'Toole? Sure, let me clear your memory. You were 15, they were between 6 and 8. You were already grown up, were half their weight and beat your waist. Does that help you, Mr. Lunny? No, this is not true. You forced them to have sex sex in front of you, Steven. Do you remember? On the bathroom stairs. Did that clear your memory? Or behind the fire exit. You are accusing my client of sexual abuse, Steven, when you know that you are the criminal. And I have witnesses to prove it. You lied, Steven. And I can prove it. 15 years ago you told the police that the Father Glackin had never touched you. That was a lie, or are you lying now? Tell us, maybe you are the liar. Answer the question? Excellency, we can have a small recess, please? Everything is fine. Fifteen minutes. Listen, I... The legal procedures had a chaotic day today with the trial of Father James Glackin when a former resident was accused of sexual abuse in younger boys from the orphanage. The fact is that the young person has a long criminal record including condemnation for prostitution and also for possession of drugs. It is expected that the trial of Father Glackin finish tomorrow. God, what a circus. Why don't you go see him, Kevin. Probably need from a friend now. Now you're going to start telling me what should I do, is it? I didn't mean it, is that... Well, how would you feel if they said that about you? Are you wanting now give ethics? He was always a bit of a bastard. Come on, Kevin. I'm just trying to help. Don't stop me from doing this. Do not stop you from doing what? I don't care what you say. At least he went there and tried do something about it. I think you should go too, Kevin. You know, you can't let that criminals get out of this. Not after what he did to you. What do you know about what did he do to me? I do not care what he did to you... I care what that is doing to you now. Listen here, Sheilah. No, listen to you. This is killing you, Kevin. Look at you. You know the way you wake up at night. He hit that guy at the bar. Get scared when we're having sex. Come on, Kevin. You know it's true. I don't think you like that. I'm warning you, Sheilah. What is it? Are you warning me? What, Kevin? What will you do? Will hit me why am I trying to help you? Leave me alone, okay? I will not leave you alone. Sheilah, there's no use wanting understand what that means. My God, this is not fair. Fair? Who talked about justice? I know what it means. It's just that after of all these years, just when I'm wanting leave all that behind, should I be smiling? Go to the TV and say: Ah yes, this is the guy who used to harass me, smoothed my neck, and dragged myself to his office. He would put me on his lap, while putting your hand on my legs and moaned. Do you want to know anything else? Do not. Isn't it ironic that on that day where the city is shocked with tragic death of young Steven Lunny... who died of an overdose... and this same day the jury gave the verdict of innocent eight counts of sexual abuse and indecent exposure against Father James Glackin, this man who tortured poor Steven when he was a little boy at the orphanage? You can talk, line 4, you're in the air. What are we looking at? We look at the picture. The board. We look at the picture. Repeat. We look at the painting. Go ahead. Do not be shy. What is that? You can say. A La... I'll be right back. Do what's on the board. What was there? What was it? Steven died. Oh my God. We are gathered here to say goodbye to our brother in Christ, Steven Lunny. Pray the Lord's prayer with me. Our Father, who art in heaven hallowed be your name Come on us your kingdom Your will be done On earth as it is in heaven Our daily bread Forgive our offenses Just as we forgive to anyone who has offended us Do not let us fall into temptation But deliver us from all evil For the Lord is the king Power and glory, forever. Amen. Lord, receive the soul of Steven Lunny And take to the presence of God And of eternal life to him, the Lord And that light from him always illuminates him. Amen. I'm fine. Come come. I'll help you. Now I have to sleep, guys. Always do whatever your wife says. That's the secret. The secret of life, isn't it, Sheilah? That one always does what she says, right? I'm almost done. But you have to set an example, right? IT IS. Very well. But first I have to say something here for my great friend Kevin. How is he, huh? Listen... Do not do it. Don't go that way. See what this did to Steven. Maybe that hadn't happened if they had left him alone, where he was, back in Toronto. I was there, man. I saw what they ended up doing with him. They told the whole world, everything, everything he did. Tell us what it was his position in 1975? I was Minister of Justice At that time. Did you know about the investigation of police inside the São Vicente orphanage? No, I never knew that. Your department gave orders to the chief of police to end the investigation. Did you know that? I was never informed. People assume that the minister should know... about such a serious case like this? It's because they don't know how the government works. Talked about this problem in your office? You know perfectly well that I cannot say what is discussed in office. I can only repeat, I didn't know anything. It is clear. Hi, Daddy is here. Chantal? Up here. What happened? I had to take the school kids, Peter. I don't want them to get involved in this whole story. What you mean? I took them to my mom's house. I don't want my kids away from me, Chantal. Well, they can't stay here. You have to go back there, I will go with you. No way. Yes I will. You are not going. I go. Chantal, you will not go with me and period. I've taken care of everything. I need to see for myself. I would love it to be with me, but your place is here, with them. Peter, I will. With or without you. You know. In the good and the bad moments, remember? Let's go to sleep. Coming soon. I was thinking about Lavin. How much I was afraid of him. Because? I was thinking if I could face it. Now listen! Maybe I'm still afraid of him. Because? Please, Father, no, don't hit me. I'll do whatever I want, mom. Please... We spent some time together, isn't it? Can you tell me what you think me now? I think I trust you. I am afraid of you. But in what way? I am afraid of myself. Peter... Alone. Being alone. Do you want to hold my hand? Do you want me to hug you, Peter? Can you look at me? Don't hurt me. I promise, I promise. I won't hurt you. There's one thing it can do for you. Everything is fine. You are a man now... an adult, he is an adult and strong man. You can go inside yourself. You'll find this little boy that you went... who was waiting for someone. And you will load this waiting for a lifetime. Yes. He should find us here somewhere. Hello, you are there. Peter. Nice to see you again. Good to see you. George Stoney, this is Chantal. Now we can go. Come. Ave Maria, full of grace The Lord is with you Blessed are you among women, Blessed is the Fruit from your womb, Jesus! Holly Mary mother of god, pray for us sinners, now and at the time of our death. Amen! Peter... Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you Blessed are you among women, Blessed is the Fruit from your womb, Jesus! Please... Please... Tell me... What kind of thing am I going to hear in court tomorrow? Peter... I think I can understand. I think I can forgive him. But you will have to tell me What did you do. Say your name, please? Kevin Reevey. You swear that the testimony that will give in this court will be the truth, only the truth and nothing more that the truth, in the name of God? I swear. I have here a testimony from witness, I would like you to look. The signature at the end, Mr. Reevey. I ask you now: this is his signature, made with your own hands? Yes it is. If you can see at the beginning of the document, sir. I would like to make you some questions referring to this testimony. Do you remember saying that Detective Noseworthy? Yes I remember. Are you prepared to tell the this court what did they do to you? I am Excellent. I'll give you a break to read the testimonial. I would like to start at night of December 7... it was the night you ran away from the orphanage and was brought back by police. Do you remember that incident? Yes I recall. And when the police brought him back, who did they give it to? To Father Lavin. Can you tell that court what happened next? He told me to enter his office. And I did what he sent me while he talked amicably with the cops. I was waiting inside. And he went in and closed the door. Then he told me why sit on his lap. As he always did. What happened then? He took off my shirt and started kissing my neck and my shoulders. He said he was my mother. I said he was not my mother and that my mother was dead. And then he hit me. Mr. Reevey, our records show that you had ten years when it happened this incident. Is that correct? Yes. Is the man who did this to you, this man is here in court today? Yes. Could you point it out to the court, please? Let it be recorded that the witness identified the accused. Very well. That was not the first time you were approached sexually by Father Lavin, is it not? No, I was his boy. When it started? Shortly after that I got there. Do you remember the first time? Yes. Could you tell us about it, please? The first time was at the pool. Do you remember how it started? It was Easter. Everyone else had gone on a trip. So I went to tell him that I couldn't go anywhere. Because I was alone. I was wondering why had no uncle or aunt to visit me or take me for a walk? You know, I remembered of my parents and the funeral. I knew it was time. But I had to think who had a family. And I went to see Father Lavin. He was nice to me after that. We went swimming. We were alone at the pool, and... I remember we have a lot of fun. He would lift me up and throw me into the water. Suddenly he started to hug me and press me against him. Then he took off my trunks. And then you took his too. And he pressed me against him. And what did he do next? He kept squeezing me against him. I felt that he was getting excited. And he tried to force the his penis inside me. I remember I cried a lot because it was hurting. He did this for a long time. He was moaning and murmuring, and finally stopped. And after this I became his boy... he always called me in his office. There he is. Will be all right. I would like to talk with my husband. It is clear. I'll stay outside. You didn't feel anything when did you hear that statement? Yes, I did. I felt like I was the martyr my whole life. First for these poor people liars and now for you. Don't you feel any guilt? No shame? Kevin Reevey... was a lonely little boy from whom I liked the bottom of my heart. I loved him. Love it? You call that love? Yes, I do. No, that is not loving. This is hurting. You hurt too much that little boy. I could kill you. I will ask you just one time: Have you ever molested our children? Why don't you ask yourself for them? They are your children. You're right. Are my kids. They are no longer your children.
