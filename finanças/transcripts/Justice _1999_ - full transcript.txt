You must think i'’m really stupid. I Don'’t appreciate that. Frankly, I think it'’s insulting. I Don'’t know what'’s going on, man, we'’re just trying to make you a deal on those 1,000 kilos. We'’re not trying to stiff you or nothing. We'’re on the level, man. I'’m sure you are, Ortiz, or should I say pogani? [Gunshot] - Jesus! Oh, god. You'’re a d.E.A. Agent. Please. I'’m going to piss on your dead body. Aah! Freeze! D.E.A! Come on! Come on! Let'’s see those arms. Come on, get up. - Guillermo Rivera, you'’re under arrest for money laundering. I'’ll be seeing you in a federal court in Chicago. Fuck you, puta. Better brush up on your English, '’cause that kind of language is not going to go over well in court. You'’re never going to win this. If I Don'’t get you for drug trafficking, or for the murder of agent pogani, i'’m going to get you for this. You'’re going to jail. Big time. - Fuck you! - Hey! Hey! - [Shouting], you fucking puta! Take that! - Outside! - I just said, "fuck me? No asshole, fuck you." Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Blew '’em away! [Chatter] Next rotation. Hey! [Alarm bell ringing] Honor the godfather, you asshole! - You can'’t stop me! - Let go go me. - Get him out of here! [Security buzzer] - Hey, sal! - [Cheering] - Hey, sal, looking good, man! - [Laughing] - You help me when I get out, sal? - Don'’t worry. I'’ll take care of you. I'’ll take care of you. Remember that. - You'’re the man! - Spello. You'’re out of solitary. - Yeah. I'’ll be outside in a month. Maybe you get to Chicago. I can use you. - Yeah. Maybe i'’ll give you a call. - Ok. - Hey, sal! - Ms. Gallagher, ahem. I assume you have a final sentencing recommendation. Yes, we have, your honor. The defendant Rivera is the mastermind behind the importation of tons of cocaine into Chicago. He'’s also responsible for the murders of d.E.A. Agent pogani and another informant in Colombia. - Objection, your honor. There'’s no evidence linking my client to the deaths of pogani and-- - Mr. Frome-- - and an informant in Colombia. - This is a sentencing, Mr. Frome. The prosecution may argue all reasonable inferences from the facts. Please continue, Ms. Gallagher. - We recommend that your honor sentence the defendant to life imprisonment without parole. Hmm. - The court sentences Guillermo Rivera to concurrent life terms of each count of the indictment. The defendant will not be eligible for parole under counts 2 and 3. That means, Mr. Rivera, you will never leave the federal penitentiary. The defendant will be remanded into the custody of the marshal. Court is adjourned. All rise. [Camera shutters click] - Congratulations, on the trial. - Thank you. Um, exhausted and happy. My colleagues and I have been working around the clock on this. So it'’s a great payoff for all of us. - Excuse me. Well, he really got hammered. Good job, Carlo. - Thank you, boss. But Gina made the case. - She'’s no doubt enjoying the press. I think they want to see her go places. - Yeah, maybe. Have a nice day. Move it! [Alarm chirps] [Dialing] [Ringing] [Machine whirring] [Phone ringing] Hello, y&z auto wreckers. Juan, we'’re on for tonight. - Si. - This time it be a Van. Si. [Speaking Spanish] - Time. It'’s got to be finished by 8:00 tonight. You go back to Colombia tomorrow. - We could celebrate and have some fun with a bitch, huh? - Yeah! - Hey. Hey! Escuchame. This has to be a clean hit on both of them. In and out, no games. Understood? - Understood, senor reyes. No hay problema con eso. - Ok. You can fuck like rabbits in Cali. - See him? You did it, Gina. - No, we did it. - Well then, here'’s to us. God, it'’s pretty incredible, Don'’t you think? I mean, here we have a guy who murders a government agent, and we get him for money laundering because we can'’t make the murder charges stick. Sometimes you'’ve got to take it anyway you can. Sometimes I think it'’s all just a big game like chess-- whoever makes the smartest move wins. - It'’s about truth, too. Isn'’t it? - Lady justice is blindfolded, you know. - I thought the blindfold meant she doesn'’t discriminate. - Nope. It means sometimes you got to go to court with part of the truth hidden as if it doesn'’t exist. But the hell with all that. We won. You bet we did. [Glasses clank] - I just wanted to tell you all the arrangements are in place for tonight. - Good. Just make sure it'’s clean. - You bet. - U.S. marshal'’s here to see you. - Send him in. [Door opens] So Gallagher got him, huh? - Everyone says she'’s the apple of the judge'’s eye. She must have given him a blowjob in chambers. - We have a problem. - You going to tell me or do I need to call a psychic? I just talked with my informant in Colombia says there could be a hit out on a prosecutor. It could even be Gallagher for all I know. Come on, bill, every macho doper in Colombia says he'’s going to whack a prosecutor. - Yeah. What if this is the real thing? You'’ve been using agency funds to finance that informant, bill. Let me remind you, that'’s illegal. If this comes out your career is over. And since I know about it, my head'’s going to roll, too. Misuse of government funds-- press is going to love that. - So you'’re just going to sit on this tip? - It'’s just an empty threat by some doped out losers. Why risk our careers over it? [Sighs] [Door opens, closes] - Frankie tells me that you'’re, uh, diversifying. - Yes. There is a great demand for heroine these days. We'’d like to get a slice of the pie. You need our European skills to complement your peasant hands. Fine. Frankie, here, will be your contact. [Door closes] Fucking peasants! It'’s like--it's like stealing candy from a kid. [Rustling] [Gasps] - Oops. I can take care of those for you, Gina. If you'’re on your way out, that is. - Oh, that would be great, treala. Thank you. - My pleasure. I'’ve been watching you on television all afternoon. What an exciting job you have. - Yeah. They keep you on your toes. Well, you can pick these up whenever you want. Thank you so much. - Ok. And i'’ll keep my eyes peeled for more of these. - Ok. [Engine starts] Fuck! Let'’s get the fucking Mexican. - Yeah, motherfucking... - Hey there, Ms. Superhero. Come here you. - Thank you for the beautiful flowers. - Oh, honey, I am so proud of you. - Thank you. You look great tonight. Thank you. I feel great. And there'’s a reason for it. Maybe even more than one. Oh? Honey, to your victory. Thank you. [Dog barking] Flowers for Gutierrez, please. - Ok. No! Aah! Aah! No! [Screaming continues] No! No! No! No! Run! Run! Run! - Quiet woman, we Don'’t want to hurt you! Take him! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! [Screaming continues] Oh, he got out! Gina! Gina! [Speaking Spanish] Aah! [Screaming stops] Shh. - [Coughing, groaning] Gina... I have accepted. What? You accepted what? The job offer in New York, of course. The job offer in New York? The one with the law firm sutherland and Williams? They'’re the top of the heap. Heh. You took a job in New York without even talking to me about it? Honey, I did this for us. I mean, this is my gift to you. Your gift to me? You know this-- this is my big night. And now you'’re asking me to just give up everything that i'’ve worked for and just move to New York with you? - But you'’ve proven yourself now. - Proven myself? What exactly does that mean? - Oh, come on. You know exactly what we'’re talking about-- this overzealous need to bust the bad guy. And even your dad would say "enough is enough." Overzealous need? It'’s-- it'’s a poor choice of words. Listen. You Don'’t owe your dad anything. And just because his killer was never convicted, that doesn'’t mean you have to spend the rest of your life making up for it. Now, honey, I think that i'’ve been very supportive and understanding through this whole crusade of yours. Forget about that crummy prosecutor job and come with me to New York. We'’ll settle down. We'’ll have kids. We'’ll live the good life. What? You have absolutely no idea who I am. Goodbye, Scott. Honey, what-- [Dog barking] Honey, i'’m home. [Muffled yelling] Aah! [Speaking Spanish] - Don'’t hurt her! Don'’t hurt her! - This is a gift from Guillermo Rivera to say thank you. I'’m sorry. Sorry. I'’m sorry. Vamanos, hermano. [Door opens] [Door closes] [Doorbell rings] [Doorbell rings] Hi. I thought I saw you enter downstairs. Maybe you want these in your bedroom tonight. No. Why Don'’t you keep them, treala? - Really? - Yeah. I--i Don'’t really want them. I already have so many. You should have them. In that case, i'’ll be happy to take them. Oh, by the way. I missed another delivery for you tonight. I'’m sorry. That'’s all right. Don'’t worry about it. They'’ll--they'll probably come back later. Ok. See ya. See ya. [Engine stops] - What took you so long? - The bitch didn'’t show up. But we got the fuckin'’ Mexican, and we threw in the wife as a bonus. - Did you leave the gun there? - Of course, as you instructed. - Good. Then it'’s party time. Get in the back. I'’ll take you to the airport. - All right, amigo. - Colombia! - Ow! - J the love of my life j j who never made me cry j [Click] [Doorbell rings] [Banging at door] - Gina, are you there? [Banging continues] [Doorbells rings] - Gina! Are you in there?! [Banging continues] [Knocking] [Doorbell ringing] - Gina! Gina! [Banging] - You ok? - Yeah, i'’m ok. What'’s going on? - You guys wait for me outside. God, moe, what happened? Carlos Gutierrez and his wife were murdered in their home last night. - What? Oh, my god! You gave us a real scare when you didn'’t answer the phone and you weren'’t at your office. - And their kid? He'’s ok. He's with relatives. My, baby. It could'’ve been you. The thought of losing you... The Colombians are retaliating. I didn'’t think they would dare. Don'’t ever underestimate their stupidity. So what do we do now? There'’s going to be a joint taskforce. I should be in charge. When'’s the meeting? - In an hour. But listen. You should stay out of their way. Colombians could still be coming after you. This is my job, moe! I know this case and all the people involved better than anyone. And I should be in charge. Gina, you'’re an adult, and you can do whatever you want. But I promised your father that i'’d look after you. Gina, please. Listen to an old homicide detective and stay out of it. My gut tells me it'’s not over yet. I love you, moe. And you'’ve always been there for me. But I have cop blood in my veins and I cannot walk away from this. Dad wouldn'’t want me to and you know that. Unfortunately, the U.S. attorney couldn'’t be here. He'’s flying back from Europe as we speak. In the meantime, i'’m acting on his behalf. - We'’re doing a computer run on the prints. But we assume the mutts aren'’t on file in Chicago or in any other city. - Before you go assuming things, superintendant, Don'’t you think you should consider the other possibilities? Home invasions, for instance, they'’re a big staple of the 5:00 news these days. - We'’ve got the gun and a flower box. A neighbor across the street from the Gutierrez'’ says she saw a gray delivery Van parked outside. But Irma'’s flowers doesn'’t exist. None of the stuff is traceable. This was a professional hit. - I'’d like to remind the superintendent this is a federal investigation. I Don'’t think the police should go deciding what kind of case it is on their own. What'’s the matter, marshal? No hot tips to brag about this time? - Uh, no offense, Lou. But I think marshal Norton is raising a few legitimate questions. Would the Colombians retaliate on the day of Rivera'’s sentencing and finger themselves? Retaliation, Ms. Newhart, is meant to be a demonstration of power. But why would pros take the time to rape the wife? - Yeah. Maybe Carlos Gutierrez had other enemies outside his work. - [Helicopter flies by] Why are you so eager to play the other angle? - I Don'’t get it. - Ok. Ok. Let'’s all calm down and cooperate. It'’s important that every department support the investigation with information. I want to take on this case and lead the taskforce. No, Gina, you'’re too emotionally involved. I know this case inside and out. I want it. And I owe it to Carlo and Alicia. I'’m sorry. I can'’t let you take it. The marshal needs to do a risk assessment. If the Colombians should be behind it, you may be in danger. They'’re not going to do anything. They already made their point. And they know there will be cops on every street corner. Ms. Gallagher, I tend to agree with Ms. Newhart. You should stay out of this until the heat'’s off. We'’ll give you 24-hour police protection. - The marshal'’s office should provide the protection, superintendent, so we Don'’t step on each others'’ toes. Fine. - Ok. Then. At the press conference I will take the position that we'’re following all leads and aren'’t ruling anything out in terms of who the killers might be. [Police radio chatter] - How'’d it go? - Not good. They want me off the case. God, I Don'’t get it. It'’s such an obvious retaliation. That'’s even the position the superintendent takes. And then my own office-- newhart and marshal horton, they sat there pushing this random violence angle. They still want me off the case. If it'’s random violence, then i'’m not in any danger. I'’ve been thinking about it, Gina. It sure looks like a professional hit. But the-- the rape? Why didn'’t you tell me Alicia was raped, moe? It was bad enough telling you the two of them had been murdered. Look, the rape does change the picture a little. From the outside, yes. They found the flower box at the crime site. And a neighbor saw a delivery Van outside. Now I was out last night. But my neighbor said somebody tried to deliver flowers. Did you tell them this? Why should I? I want to talk to my neighbor first. Heh. All right. [Engine starts] We'’re in big trouble. Calm down, bill. - Calm down?! We sat on the tip and the prosecutor and his wife are dead. - Lower your voice and stop being so dramatic. It'’s unfortunate about Carlo and his family. But we had no choice and there is no going back now. Not necessarily, we could-- listen to me. The cops are going to run into a wall on this. I am sure of it. Gallagher'’s off the case. She'’s not going to poke her nose anywhere near our informant. The whole thing is going to blow over and nobody ever has to know about our involvement. We just have to sit tight and stick it out. And remember that if one of us goes down, we both go down. [Door opens, closes] Eh, sometimes it'’s good with a watchdog neighbor. Not a lot gets past treala. So now we know for sure they came for you, too, last night. Gina, I have a bad feeling about this. You should move out. Look, Don'’t worry. They'’re posting marshals' deputies here 24 hours. - I still Don'’t-- - moe, listen! Let the marshal do their job. I need your help elsewhere. What are you up to? I'’m not going to walk away from this. This is my case. And I owe it to Carlo and Alicia to finish it. Don'’t do this to me, Gina. I already have 15 knots in my intestine. This is not a game. We'’re talking about professional killers for Christ'’s sake. I Don'’t want to come up here and see you raped and cut-- - moe, I Don'’t-- - yeah, I know. You Don'’t want to hear all that. But you'’re not in your shiny offices anymore. You'’re down here on my level now. You'’re in the gutter. There are no roses growing down here, Gina. Only rotting stems. I didn'’t know you had a poetic streak, moe. Look, I promise i'’ll stay here with the marshals outside my door. But you got to help me out and dig a little. [Street train passing] You guys are getting sluggish. Don'’t you ever let this happen again on this post! You should protect that girl as if she were your own daughter. You understand?! Don'’t bother. Moe Ryan. Homicide. You girls have a good day. Eh? Keep your eyes peeled, ok? I'’m reporting you for this, asshole. Yeah, you do that. Not a fucking word about who did it. Federales are not convinced it was retaliation yet. Our 2 friends had a little fun. Made it look like home invasion. It'’s an embarrassment. We have to show them who rules. - The bitch? - Go ahead. - Senor jaramillo. - Frankie. - Excuse me. I only trust Colombians. Have a seat. What'’s the word? Don licato has spoken to the sicilians. But he says he needs some time to organize the deal. How long? A week, tops. I will get back to you on the time and the day. All right, Frankie. Look at this. Who the fuck is dumb enough to whack a federal prosecutor, huh? I mean, who the fuck wants that much heat? Go figure. Yeah. Go figure. [Slams hand] I'’ll be in touch, senor. - Ciao. [Chatter] Aah! - Honey, i'’ve been trying to reach you all day. I heard on the news what happened. And i'’m really worried about you. I hope you'’re in a safe place. Gina, I Don'’t want our relationship to end like this. But this new job is so important to me, I have to pursue it. I'’m leaving for New York in the morning. And I want to talk to you. Please call me. Bye. [Machine clicks, beeps] [Gasps] [Gunshot] [Footsteps approaching] Are you ok? Yeah. I'’m Eric Anderson. Moe sent me. He didn'’t trust the deputies. He was right. We should leave right now. - Ok. [Police siren] [Police radio chatter] [Vehicles approaching] - Ok? Go. - Got it. - Great job, marshal. - Save your sarcasm. Ryan, Gallagher'’s gone. - Maybe they took her. - If they did we'’re going to find her in little pieces. - Don'’t worry. She's ok. She won'’t be needing your protection anymore though. It'’s just too stressful. [Doors opens, closes] [Moe'’s car engine starts] [Shifts gear] [Church bell ringing] [Vehicle approaches] [Vehicle approaches] So, Maurice, did you stop by to give your confession? - That would be the day. She ok? - Uh, now she is. You ought to take better care of your goddaughter, you know. - Oh, stop it. Always the big brother, huh? - Yeah. - You ok? - Fine. - You sure? - Fine. I'’m sure she would have felt better if you hadn'’t left her alone. Knock it off, aloysius. I put Eric "the Swede" there, didn'’t I? He always picks on me. I can'’t imagine why. - Brotherly love. - Well, i'’ll leave you two to your worldly pursuits. Oh, by the way, Maurice, I hear confessions 7:30 every day. You got a great deal going because I hear them at all hours of the day and night. - Ha ha! - I'’ll be right outside. Yell if you need anything. Coffee, tea, husband. - Come on, Eric. That was a big hit they put on you tonight. The second time in 2 days. You almost scared the life out of this old guy here. What do you have? Oh. The feds haven'’t been sharing too much information with our guys. That'’s a big surprise. What about prints? Forget it. The Colombians'’ prints aren'’t computerized. So the gray Van is our only lead. Well, if they were real smart they would'’ve brought in expendable hit men and deep-six them with the Van. Wouldn'’t be a trace left if that'’s the case. But, hey, there'’s always a chance of divine intervention, right? It'’s good that you stay here. And i'’ll have Swede watch over you anyway. [Gasp] Don'’t be scared. I'’m special agent frank spello from the f.B.I. I'’m working undercover so i'’m not carrying an I.D. You'’re going to have to trust me. How did you find me? I tagged Ryan. I guess he was so concerned about you, he forgot to check his tail. Now look, I shouldn'’t be making contact like this. But I got to talk to you. I have infiltrated the Italians. All right, I work with sal licato. We'’re doing business with this guy named jaramillo. Now I believe jaramillo'’s the one putting the hit on you. And he'’s not going to let go until you'’re dead. Jaramillo? How do you know? I saw it in his eyes. In his eyes? That'’s how I read people. That'’s how I stay alive. Now look, i'’m working on the Italian organization. So it ain'’t going to hurt me if you nab jaramillo. But I can'’t help you either. The bureau would crucify me if they knew I was talking right now. - Then why you doing it? I have personal reasons. Well, that doesn'’t sound very convincing. How do I trust you? How do I know you'’re not setting me up? I'’m not going to waste my time to prove myself here. You either use what I tell you or you Don'’t. That'’s up to you. You call this number and leave a message only for emergencies. Otherwise I will contact you. And do not tell Ryan who I am. This is between you and me. You can'’t tell me? She can'’t tell me. I Don'’t like it. I want to know who i'’m dealing with. I Don'’t want to walk around blindfolded. - All right, you listen to me, Maurice. - Oh, now she calls me Maurice. I'’m not going to tell you who the informant is, and that'’s that. Now the best way to find out how legit this guy is is to follow the lead. Now we'’ve got a name. That a hell of a lot more than we had before. - If you weren'’t so damn stubborn. All right! I'’ll run the name, see what comes up. And check the phone records. Oh, unofficially, of course. What about a subpoena, Ms. Straight arrow? I'’m just looking for leads. Phone records aren'’t private. I'’ll see what I can dig up. And I want to have a look at this guy. You think the boys are up for a stakeout? [Grumbles] Why is it that you always need to pee when you'’re on a stakeout? - What? - Yeah. I mean, I could go to a movie, a ballgame, spend a couple of hours-- never have to pee. I'’m on a stakeout 5 minutes, boom, my bladder is filled to the brim. - It'’s not a conscious thing. See, no, I saw a program about that on TV. It'’s deep down in your subconscious, you know, like where your really important thoughts are, the thoughts that are like really you. - The important thoughts that are really me? - Right. - So you'’re saying I'm piss? - No. I'’m saying that you have like some deep-seeded feelings about pissing. Enough of the piss talk. Now I have to take a leak. A bunch of freaks. Bingo. There'’s the beemer. [Shutter clicking] Oh, marone. Nice skirt, huh? That'’s what I call easy access. Yeah. Seen those legs before. - Yeah? Where? - Last night in my dreams. What'’s that? Fish? I hope you didn'’t call this meeting just to comment on my choice of lunch. Ryan hasn'’t been on duty, and I have no idea where he stashed Gallagher. Well, if she'’s with Ryan, she might not just be hiding out. They could be working the case on the sly. What'’s their connection anyway? Ryan was Gallagher'’s father Marty'’s partner. Marty was shot in the line of duty. Ryan raised his daughter like his own. A real sob story. Marty was a real boy scout, everybody loved him. How do you think she got where she is today? You can only get so far on your back. If they'’re working the case together, they could stumble on our informant, and trace him back to us. - So you have to locate her and find out what she'’s up to. - He also has a brother, a priest. I'’m thinking they might have gotten sanctuary there. You know, I Don'’t need to hear your every little thought. They'’re not that interesting. Just go out and do your job. - Bill? - Yes? - I'’m going to be the next U.S. attorney. And that'’s going to be very good for you. So if it'’s her or us, it'’s going to be her no matter what, right? [Door opens, closes] Checkmate. [Sighs] It'’s the 3rd time. I hate this. I hate it. One more. Just one more. This time i'’ll beat you. - You sure you'’re up to it? I'’m up to it. I'’m up to it. - All right. Suit yourself. Can anybody explain the expression "god-fearing." [Door closes] I mean, if god is so good, why should we fear him? I see you'’re working hard as usual. What do you have? - Save the courtesies. I'’ve got important stuff to talk about. - Sorry. Did you run the plate? Yeah. The BMW is registered to a guy named reyes. And he'’s at the address on the drive. But the phone records are pretty interesting. There'’s a cellular phone, and it shows one short call on may 4, right after the sentencing. - Who does that come back to? - Not who. What. Y&z auto wreckers on south Cicero. Exactly the kind of place you could get rid of a Van. You'’re a genius, Maurice. - That'’s what I keep telling people. What are we standing around here for? Let'’s boogie while we'’re on a roll. - Heh heh. Let'’s go. [Knocking] - Yes? - Um, good evening, Mr. Martinez? I'’m lt. Ryan. And this is, uh, agent totsen of the f.B.I. - The f.B.I? What do you want? I--i haven'’t done anything. Please, Mr. Martinez, may we talk to you alone? Ok. Come in. Come in, please. - Thank you. - Come in. [Speaking Spanish] Go on. - Juan, mas agua, por favor. - [Speaking Spanish] - Si. - It'’s my wife. She'’s very-- she'’s very, very sick. - I'’m sorry to hear that, Mr. Martinez. We just have a few questions about your work. - My work? - Yes, at the junkyard, the y&z. - Mr. Martinez, was a dark Van brought to your yard late, say, on Tuesday or on Wednesday? - I have done nothing wrong. - Well, that'’s good. Could you answer the question, please? I know nothing about any Van. Maybe a little trip down to the station would refresh your memory. But I Don'’t know anything. - We need to know about the Van, Mr. Martinez. Don'’t be afraid to talk to us. We can protect you and your family. We can move you far away. We can give you a whole new life. - I'’m not afraid. Now you asked me about some Van. And I say no. I Don'’t know anything about it. You asked me again. Now what would you like me to say? You listen here, you stupid little man, you know what we'’re talking about. It'’s written all over your face. I'’m going to ask you one more time. Did a Colombian by the name of jaramillo or reyes bring a Van to you? Did you look in it? If you Don'’t cooperate with us now, Mr. Martinez, and we find out that you had something to do with this, you'’re looking at some serious jail time. Please. Maybe I can talk about this with therese and Juan tonight and maybe I can remember a little tomorrow. No, Mr. Martinez, we need to know about the Van right now! - Ok. We'’ll give you 'til morning. We'’ll pick you up at 7:00. We'’ll take you to the yard. And we'’ll go over it all then, all right? Yes, in the morning. In the morning. Ok, Mr. Martinez, this is our deal. We'’re trusting you, ok? All right. [Door opens] [Door closes] Reyes. Habla Juan, si. - I got a bad feeling about letting this ride overnight, Gina. We should'’ve leaned on the guy. - Look, he wasn'’t talking. And the taskforce will need him as a friendly witness. - Yeah, but why? The Van is obviously at the yard. We'’re onto the right guys. The call from the cell phone links the Van to jaramillo and reyes. - But all that proves is that a call was made. Who made the call and what was said? Unless there'’s evidence in the Van, we'’re going to need Juan to point the finger at the trial. Well, i'’m going to put a car on the house here. And i'’m going to put another car on the yard. Have a dog team to meet us in the morning. [Footsteps approaching] [Knocking at back door] [Both speaking Spanish] - Did you see the federales outside? They know everything. - I saw them. Don'’t worry about it. - They were here. I didn'’t tell them anything. Not a word. I haven'’t told anyone-- not my wife, not my son, no one. Ninguna. - Hey, would we use you if we didn'’t trust you? - Thank you, man. It feels good to hear that. - Relax. How'’s the family? - Oh, so-so, man. - Wife, she doing better? - She'’s not doing too well, i-- I think we'’re going to lose her soon. Let me have a word with him. Thanks. Why--why would he do this? We were happy. Why would he kill himself? - What happened? - I Don'’t know. I heard a bang. And I came down and I found-- the people we'’re after are very bad. We wanted your father to help us arrest them. We didn'’t want to hurt your family. Juan, did your father tell you why we came to see him? No. No. Did he mention anything about a Van brought to his yard a few days ago? Maybe off regular hours? No. All my father told me was that he was-- he said he was crushing cars for some people for some extra money. [Helicopter whirring] That was no suicide. The scumbag got to him. We should'’ve made him talk. - You'’re right, moe. It'’s all my fault we'’re finished. We can'’t help anybody convict anyone. - We were so close. We were so close. - Look, moe, it'’s not over yet. We still have to check the junkyard. Eh. 2 guys shot in the head and crushed up inside. You'’re lucky you didn't see it. Ugh. I'’ll never order a meat fajita again. - Are there any prints? - Not very likely. Blood and oil all over the place. Going to take days just separating their noses from the sparkplugs. There was an untraceable gun and 2 fake I.D.S in the mess. - So there'’s nothing to build a trial on? - No. - I need to see somebody. - Yeah? - Stay away from the church for a while. - Don'’t tell me not to worry. Where is that bitch hiding out, anyway? - We got people all over town looking for her. We'’ll find her. Are you going to make a move or what? I'’m getting gray hairs while you think. - Ok. You leave your queen defenseless. How can you make such a stupid move? You told me to move. You have to think a little at least! You know, I Don'’t like chess. I think it'’s a stupid game. You'’re stupid. [Grumbles] I can'’t relax. Come over here and give me a blowjob. You find that prosecutor bitch. I want this taken care of once and for all. Now, get out. And be back at 8:00. And bring some ribs back from pepe'’s. Can'’t give you anything else, Gina. - They'’re out there laughing at us, knowing that there'’s nothing we can do about it. - Yeah, probably. - Maybe there is no justice, no right or wrong, no truth. Well, maybe you'’re just feeling sorry for yourself. Please Don'’t hold any punches, will ya? What do you expect? Them to sit down on their ass and just give up? - No, I Don'’t. Hey, look, I know--i know bad guys get away with murder and the world'’s a fucked up place. What'’s new? Oh, thanks for cheering me up. God, I feel so much better, frank. Want to feel warm and fuzzy? Why Don'’t you just change your career? You know, sell lingerie or something like that. What do you want from me, frank? - No, no. What do you want? - I want justice. - Yeah, well then go get it. I'’ve tried everything. I don't-- yeah? Well, it'’s too bad. They'’re probably going to win. That'’s not an option. You know, Gina, these guys are means sons of bitches. And if you want to beat them, you got to be meaner. You got to be tough. You got to be real tough. Oh, i'’m tough enough. You Don'’t want to know how mean I can be. You want us to break into jaramillo'’s apartment? I can'’t believe you'’re telling me this. Listen, if we find anything that links him to the Van, we'’ve got him. And what if we do find something there, what do we do with it? We leave it there and then come up with a reason for a warrant. I'’ll just have to be creative and find a very friendly judge. And we'’ll just worry about that when we get there. What do you say? I say, you do know how to play in the gutters. Now all we have to do is find a way to get by the doorman. Ah, shit. I have to pee. I knew it. Ok. Let'’s do it. [Car doors open] [Engine starts] Ok. Hey, Gina, do you need any, like, ashtrays, silverware, toilet paper, anything? [Gear shifts, engine stops] Hi. You Don'’t know how to change a tire, do you? [Elevator dings] We'’re clear. This way, guys. [Click] Gus, he'’s back. He'’s back. Clear out. We got to move. - Where'’s Tom? - Hey, we got to move it! Tom! He'’s gone. - Well, hell, he can'’t just disappear. - Well, apparently he can. Because he'’s not here. We got to get out of here. - Thanks. Where the hell did he go? - How come you didn'’t see him leave? - Me? What, am I supposed to look after Tom, now? The guy just went up in smoke. - People Don'’t just fucking go up in smoke. [Elevator dings] Hey, guys. Hey, fellas. [Door shuts] [Giggling] [Zipper opens] - Ahh. - Ooh. [Passionate moaning] Hi. I was just in the other, uh-- [moaning continues] Believe me, there'’s nothing more i'’d want right now. But, uh, i'’m late to the cleaners. I got to run. Bye. [Door opens, closes] - Nothing? - Nothing. But to tell you the truth, I didn'’t expect to find anything on the Van. They'’re too smart. So they was doing it right in front of you? - Yeah. Right there. Going at it like rabbits. Ha ha! The other girl, what did she do? What did she say? - Hey, hey, hey. Let'’s take this conversation outside. Ok? Jaramillo'’s up to something. That'’s a log of meetings. 2 Colombians have been meeting with sal "the joker" licato. It'’s no help, I know. It'’s back to square one. - Maybe. Maybe not. - ...meet with moe tonight at the rectory. Please come. [Beep] - Piss on the floor again. - That'’s disgusting. - Who'’d piss on his own floor? Nobody. When people come to a restaurant, all of a sudden they can'’t aim. - Yeah, you know, you step in, it'’s gets all over your shoes. - Exactly. It'’s disgusting. - I tell ya--you can'’t trust a guy who can'’t aim his own cock in the right direction. Punks! You know, there'’s an airport in Amsterdam where they got these little targets, these little bulls-eyes. And they put them in the urinals. And the people aim at that. Cuts down the pissing on the floor 80%. - Really? - Yeah. - That'’s a wonderful invention. I got to get me some of those. I got to go. You got to go? We'’re in the middle of a conversation. You got to go? - We'’ll pick right up with it when I get back. You want me to pick you up some meat? Yeah. Get me a nice piece of sirloin. Smell it. Make sure it'’s fresh. You got it. See ya. So you'’re the famous deepthroat. How you doing, Ryan? - Now you seem to know an awful lot about us. And we Don'’t know nothing about you. - Am I making you nervous, Ryan? - You'’d better wipe that smirk off your face. I'’m not in the mood. - Hey, relax. We'’re on the same team. - You keep telling me that. But so far I only see a wiseguy. - Hey, back off, all right? I like garlic, too, but not secondhand. Moe, stop it. Now frank'’s been a huge help so far. - We'’ve only had dead ends. - Yeah, well you got to work the case, Ryan. It'’s not going to work itself. Didn'’t they teach you that at the academy? - One more of those, dipshit-- - ok! Both of you can just reel in your macho egos and shut the fuck up! Yeah, we'’ve been running into some dead ends. But that'’s nobody's fault. Jaramillo'’s been one step ahead of us the entire time. I only have one more card to play, and that would depend on you, frank. - Go ahead. - Ok, according to jaramillo'’s schedule, you and sal are supposed to meet with him tomorrow. Yeah, that'’s right. What if we arrange for the police to stumble in on this little meeting, and we bust the bastards for conspiring with sal "the joker" to import tons of cocaine? You got this all figured out? Not entirely. Moe'’ll say he got a tip on a drug deal. Then after the bust he finds out that--oops-- you'’re with the f.B.I. So the bureau'’s going to raise hell because he fucked up their operation, blah, blah, blah. But they'’ll never know that you were in on it. And we'’ll get jaramillo. So what do you say? I know I can put sal away for a couple of lifetimes. I'’ll do it. - You'’ll do it? - Yeah. You see, that'’s what bugs me with you. You'’re undercover for what, a year? Busting your ass for this? Now you'’re willing to just end it? Never mind going behind the back of your own department. What'’s your scam, spillow? You know, you'’re an old pit bull, moe. And you just won'’t let go, will ya? It'’s my job! - It'’s the job. I come from a long line of cops. My whole family'’s just one blue streak. My real name'’s pogani. Frank pogani. - Pogani. That'’s the same-- federal agent that was shot by Rivera down in Colombia. That was my brother. All right, I know this job isn'’t supposed to be about personal feelings. But how can you help it, huh? We'’re only human. And with all this legal bullshit and game playing in court, when it'’s over what do you got left? What'’s in here. And that hurts. That fucking hurts. Now if that ain'’t enough for you, old bull, then you can go fuck yourself. I got to go. I got to set up this bust with narcotics. See you all tomorrow. I'’ll be right outside as usual, if there'’s anything you need. - Thanks, Eric. Thanks, Eric. [Door closes] Well, it'’s getting late. I'’m so sorry about your brother, frank. Yeah. I know you are. That'’s why I like you. You'’re not in it for the glory. You'’re in it because you got to. What? You see all that in my eyes? Let me see. You'’re a woman who wants perfection. Perfect day, perfect case, a perfect world, perfect man. And you'’re crushed when you realize it doesn'’t exist. And you won'’t admit it. And on the outside you play the perfect cynic. Now personally, I like perfection, too. But i'’ll settle for a little at a time. Like that Ben Johnson poem, "in short measures life may perfect be." [Church bell ringing] Sal'’s sirloin! Oh, god, I can'’t believe it. Where'’s Gina? In the chapel. Getting any answers? - No. But the questions are sure piling up. - Oh, yeah? The bed got cold. I missed you. - Good. Father Ryan said something about a lot of noise coming from the guest bedroom last night. Oh, you were being too loud. He'’s a priest. He'll forgive me. I got to hook up with sal, forgot his sirloin. His sirloin? Never mind. I'’ll meet you at 3:00 for the wire. - Frank. - Hmm? - They'’re sure about the guy spillow? - They ran his plate. We'’ve got his wrap sheet and photo. He'’s with sal licato. - The hell is going on here? That little bitch. I am not going to let her pull us down. Call of your men so we Don'’t have anyone around her. Leak where she is to some of your dope informants. And then leak to one of your TV news friends that she'’s involved with a known gangster. She'’s going down. One way or the other. [Tearing] Is that ok? That'’s good. So you meet at 8:30, and you all drive to another car. Did you transfer the money? Yeah, reyes confirmed it an hours ago. Colombia, they must deliver even the mail that way, huh? Trunk to trunk. - Now where would you be without your ethnic stereotypes, moe? Dead. You know, i'’m not sure about sal. He might try to scam the Colombians. He hates them. - As long as you get the deal on tape, he can do whatever he wants later. - Oh, well. I'’ll have them singing like canaries on sunday morning. Why Don'’t we use a radio mic? I Don'’t like that we can't hear what'’s going down. I would never wear a radio mic. I work alone, remember? You'’re supposed to accidently fuck up my operation. We got to make it look real. Ok. You'’re the boss on this one. [Sighs] All right, let'’s go. We got to meet those narcotics guys in 15 minutes. You be careful, frank. [Thundering] [Thunder] There you are! Come on in. Sit down. Buena noche. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. You guys drink coffee? If it'’s good. Bring us up a coffee. Now you guys got pretty good coffee in Colombia. But this'’ll beat it. This is Italian roast. Drink a pot and you can fuck for 24 hours straight. - I'’m for that. - Ha ha ha! [Glasses clank] What'’d I tell you? Beats that shit you jungle boys drink. That'’ll be 2.50. - Heh. - What? 2.50 for the coffee. I'’m in a hurry so pay up. - Sal. That'’ll be 2.50. What are you? Fucking nuts? Nuts?! Nuts?! I'’ll tell you what nuts is. My grandfather. He got nuts. When he got old and when he saw a young girl, he went "ahh." "Ahh." "Ahh." How do you like that? Now...pay up. 50 cents. Come again. Come again! Come again until your cock drops off! Tom, Gus, something'’s up. They'’re all supposed to come out together. You guys stay on the other two. [Engine starts] Heads up, everybody. We'’ll lead on tailing the limo. [Engine starts] What'’s the matter, frank? You'’re a little tense. You think there'’s somebody back there following us? - No, no. I'’m just a little confused. That'’s all, sal. Why did you drop the Colombians like that? I mean, you didn'’t even take their money, heh. You'’re good, Frankie. Real good. But you'’re not good enough. A couple hours ago a little birdie sang a song in my ear. It was a sad song about you and a prosecutor. I'’m not following you, sal? You'’re talking riddles to me. I adopted you. And you took up with a fed cunt. Frankie, that'’s not the way to play your cards. [Tires screech] [Horn honks] - Hey, get the fuck out of the way, asshole! [Horn honking] - Come on! - I'’m working here! [Engine stops] You'’re all alone now, frank. What are you? You have no honor. Like a thief in the night, you--you stole my trust. Sal! Aah! Aah! Hurts, huh? What do you think I feel? Look at me. Over there! [Tires screech] [Gear shifts] Oh, my god. Oh, god! God! No! Oh, frank. - I sent him to his death, moe. - Oh, no. Don'’t do that to yourself, kid. The thing took on a life of its own. Frank knew what he was doing. It was his job. - Oh, my god. His job? What good does that do? Nothing we do matters. We'’re just so fucking powerless. He'’s dead, moe. And for what? The law'’s a sham. It'’s not working. All the killers and the low-lifes, they can do whatever they want, and the law protects them. But we'’re just a bunch of fucking eunuchs in a harem. We can look, but we can'’t touch. '’cause we don't have the power to act. What a job. What a great big fucking pathetic joke of a job. [Thunder] We got a lot of paperwork to do boys. - How'’s she doing? - I gave her a sleeping pill. Unplug the phone and let her sleep as long as possible. We'’ll be here early tomorrow. - Got ya, moe. [Door slides open] Just tell me if there'’s anything you need. Thank you, Eric. Frank was a good guy. A good guy. But... You'’re strong, very strong. You'’re the strongest woman that i'’ve ever met. Much stronger than all this crap. And you shouldn'’t forget that. So anyway, i'’ll be outside if you need me. [Phone ringing] [Sighs] Yes? Uh-huh. Tell me what it'’s about, and i'’ll if I'm interested. I'’m very interested. I'’ll give you 2,000 for it. Huh? She is, huh? Uh-huh. And where is this church located, my friend? Mm-hmm. [Speaking Spanish] Bingo. Now can I finish? [Knocking at door] Norton? What the hell are you doing here? Ryan, I did something real stupid. We'’ve got a serious problem. [Vibrating] - Eric shown entering his dad'’s beemer. That sleeping pill I gave Gina will put her out for a week. Ok. Good. Great, Tom. I'’ll meet you two guys at the rectory. [Glass shatters] Look out! [Police siren] Get down! Oh, god. [Gunshots] Gina. Gina. [Groans] You ok? Yeah. Yeah. God... [Police siren in distance] I can'’t believe newhart and Norton sat on the tip. Norton wanted to be able to compete with the d.E.A. And f.B.I. He paid an informant with agency funds. It'’s illegal, of course. But he got hot tips. He and newhart could make nice busts and advance on the political ladder. Real innocent if you ask me. Then it got out of hand. And Norton couldn'’t handle it. Thank god. Jaramillo'’s never going to let you go. I Don'’t care anymore. See, I Don'’t want you to stop caring. I'’d rather you hate me for the rest of your life. Why would I hate you? '’cause of what I got to do. It'’s why justice is blindfolded. She doesn'’t want to see certain things. Doesn'’t that make us like them, moe? No. Because we Don'’t do it for ourselves. I would never hate you, moe. It doesn'’t say if she is dead or not. [Police siren] What is it? Police car. And i'’m sure I wasn't speeding. Get rid of him quick. [Sighs] [Door closes] Evening, sir. How you doing, officer? - License and registration, please. - Sure. Officer, um, maybe we could speed things up a little bit? Eh, maybe we can. Now is that Carlo Gutierrez or for Eric Anderson? What the hell you talking about? [Gunshots] - The United States district court for the northern district of Illinois is now in session. The honorable judge Falcone presiding. God save the United States and this honorable court. - Mr. Foreman, I understand the jury has reached a verdict. - Yes, we have your honor. Ahem. - Thank you. Clerk will read the verdict. - "We the jury find the defendant guilty of obstruction of justice." [Clamoring, murmuring] - Order. Order in the court. [Slams gavel] Ms. Newhart. Ms. Newhart. For your own selfish motives, you intentionally endangered the life of a fellow prosecutor. And apparently you made it possible for 2 major narcotics traffickers to flee the country. And, most despicably, you sent an undercover agent and a detective to their deaths. The U.S. marshal, at least, showed some remorse by pleading guilty and testifying against you. You have shown no such remorse. And I assure you, the court will take that into account in sentencing you. For now you'’ll wait in jail for your sentencing hearing. Marshal, take the defendant into custody. Court is adjourned. - All rise. Well, I guess there is justice after all. At least a little bit anyway. Maybe. Want to go get some lunch? Ah, i'’m really on a diet right now, huh? Oh, what the hell. - You'’re buying, right? - Yeah, i'’m buying. - It'’s about time.
