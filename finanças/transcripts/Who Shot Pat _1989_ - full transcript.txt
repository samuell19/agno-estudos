Hey Tony, get this, Brooklyn has more gangs than any other borough in New York City. - [Bic] Watch it, Ricky. - Hey Bic, what gang are you in? - Are you kidding? My father would kill me. - Yeah, well, I'm gonna start a gang. - Yeah? - Yeah! Hey, you wanna join me? - Nah. (chuckling) - Yeah! Well I don't know about you, Goldie. - Ricky, you couldn't start your grandmother's Oldsmobile with a key. (boys laughing) - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Scorpions. - Woo hoo hoo, oh, oh! - First, my father would break both your legs, Ricky. Then he'd break both mine if he heard I was in a gang. - [Ricky] Look, here comes Tommy.

Let me guess. Goldie, right? (laughter) I mean, if Goldie's here, that means Bic, Vinny, Tony, and Patakango aren't far behind, am I right? - [Boy] Patakango is not here yet. - Guys, explain something to me. How come you guys always go to school together, go to lunch together, go home together? I mean, this is the last year, you know, like loosen up. - Hey, you forgot me, Cougar. - Everybody should forget you, Ricky.

Now get outta here before I call the cops. (footsteps pattering) (coat whooshes) - Up yours, Mr. Donnelley. - What were you going to do with that? Bash his head in, blind him, kill him? If you're gonna hit him, killing him makes sense, that way he can't come back at you. Boy, you've got a bad side, Bic, and if you don't get a handle on it, you're gonna wind up dead, maimed, or in jail. Now, throw it away! (plunk clanks) And where's your white shirt, Bic?

(class laughing) - Yes, in this dump, and if it is a dump, what does that make you? When are you people gonna learn? It is your school. (giggling) Let me tell you kids something, pride comes from doing something you can feel proud about, then maybe you can start feeling some pride in yourself.

(gasping) - Hey, Cheeky Donnelley. (boys scrambling) (door squeaks open) - What are you boys doing in here? - Studying. - Studying? (door squeaking) (heavy footsteps pattering) (loud crashing) - Maybe Patakango was shot by the Fortibaldi's. - You know my cousin who goes to Rasmus High School, he said that I'm here with the Fordham Bolton going around to all the high schools, stomping and kicking ass. - Rasmus? The Baldie Sisters could stop the Rasmus. The Boarding Baldies, they coming here? - Maybe we'll be lucky and you'll send your sisters in. (laughter) - I hope so. - I heard that when they first get to a school, they see a guy and they grab them and they cut his hair off. (laughing) - That's how they got the name "Boarding Baldies." - Wait, I thought they got the name 'cause they were bald. - All right, don't worry, 'cause I'd break their fucking arms if they touch one little hair on my cute little baby brother's head. - Aww - Aww, he's such a nice a boy. (laughter) - Don't you got a class to go to? - Yeah, so? - Now get out of here. (bell ringing) - Hurry, let's go. (indistinct chatter) (footsteps pattering) - Hey Mark, Look. - What? - I know it's hard, but if you don't fight you're nothing, you're just a bum. - What are you telling me this for? - 'Cause I hear some kid in your class said he's gonna put your lights out. - Who told you that? Did Patakango tell you that? I was in the school yard, Bic. - Nevermind who told me that, the next time someone says he's gonna put your lights out, you put his lights out. I don't care where you are, if you don't, you make me and you look bad. If you need me, just come and get me. - I don't need you to fight my fights, I can take care of myself. And nobody's making you look bad either. - And why are you wearing this jacket, I never said you could wear it? - Here, here's your jacket. - Get to class. - Yeah! - All right, gentlemen, today, we're going to talk about- (student sniggering) universal motors. Anybody know what that is? (class responding) Very good gentlemen, very good, all right. (student sniggering continues) We have a diagram here that's gonna help you understand it.

You too, come on, let's go. (whistles) Wait a minute, what is going on here? Bickham, Fenelli, what are you? What are you doing here? - We're here with Mr. Dorf, for morning class. - What are you doing in here, get out in the hall. - All right, just wait one second, just wait a minute. All right, do any of you speak Spanish? - [Boy] No. - I speak Italian. - Same thing, would you ask this young lady what her name is her name is? (boys quietly chuckling) Just her name? (speaking Italian) (speaking foreign language) - That's a beautiful name. - Ask her what happened. - It doesn't sound like Spanish to me. - She pushed me and she called me black shit or something. I wanna kill her. (whooping) - She doesn't even speak English. - You shut up, no one asked you and why aren't you in your class anyway? - My name is Goldie! - I'm gonna cut your face girl. - We're looking for Mr. Robin Grey. - [Goldie] My name is Goldie. - Mr. Grey. - Yes! - Goldie, do you live around here? - [Levy] I'm detective Levy, my partner, Detective Driskill - Goldie, Goldie? - We're here to investigate the shooting of a Michael Patatango. - Patakango! - Mitsy, Mitsy, you're staying here with me.

Gentlemen, come with me into my office please. - Mr. Gray, you have a race relations problem here? (indistinct chattering) (footsteps pattering) (heavy footsteps) - Eight! (boys jabbering) Eight, eight is the party. - Eight, all right eight, don't be late we gonna be great 'cause I got paid. - Come on, come on! - No! Let's go. - I'm a poet and you know it. - Let's go, let's go again. - Come on, roll the dice! - One more, one more. - And... No, no, no, no! (indistinct chatter) - Pay up, pay up, yeah!

Mom says dinner's ready. (TV clicks off) (food sizzling) (muffled footsteps pattering) (chairs clinking) (plates clink) - [Mom] Mark, what happened to your face? (somber piano notes) - What, what's wrong with his face? - [Mom] Well, he's got a black eye and a fat lip. - What happened, Mark? - Nothing. - You've been fighting. - You got beat up. - I didn't get beat up. - Your mother says you've got a black eye. - I don't have a black eye, it's just a little red. It's nothing. - Who you been fighting with- - Dad, did I tell you I took my draft physical yesterday? - Who you been fighting with? - No, it's not, it's not that, dad, dad. - Dad, you should see the other guy, Mark killed him. - Yeah, I bet he looked real bad. - Oh yeah?

(somber music) - Don't say that. - Some nights, I lie right here swearing that someday when he grabs me, I'm gonna grab him. And when he hits me, I'm gonna hit him back. - I can remember before the fall. He put me up on his shoulder to watch the SS Missouri being launched from the navy yard. - Do you remember the farm? - Nah. I was too young. Now remember- - Never get cornered. - If you do? - Don't get knocked down. - If you do? - Cover your head. - And scream like hell. Now go to sleep. (piano fades) - Hey, hey, wanna smoke?

(piano slows to a stop) (street ambiance) (somber piano notes) (intense dramatic music) (footsteps on pavement) (dramatic music continues) - Huh, what's this? - Shouldn't have messed with my brother. - Huh, do I know you? Hey, you're the guy from yesterday, right? (switchblade clicks) What's your beef? Huh? - [Bib] That was my brother yesterday, you shouldn't have messed with him. - Oh yeah, what are you gonna do, huh? You're gonna hit me with your newspaper? Go ahead. I'll give you the first shot.

All over me, all over the nurse, all over the doc. So, she washes my arm and you won't believe it. I got two tiny little holes; one here and one here. The doc tells the nurse to keep my arm still. So, she takes my hand. She pushes it right up against her knockers. - No way - No, I swear Vinnie. (whooping) And then the doc pokes around in the holes. "Does it hurt?", he asks. "No", I say. - Wait, you didn't feel it? - No! And then he says, "can you move your hands?" So, I moved my hands, she didn't even move. (whooping continues) The cops are waiting for me when I come downstairs. The doc told about some kind of gunshot wound. I tell him I did it on a wire fence on my way to school where a rusty nail was sticking out of a piece of wood. (chuckling) - But we gotta get outta here, you know, we're meeting your brother down in Greenwich Village. - Oh, well I'm coming too. - No you're not. - Why? - Hey, it's not us, kid. You know, it's your brother. - It's your brother, Mark. Hey, listen, me and you gotta talk. You've gotta learn to take care of yourself, you know what I mean? - Yeah, but Pat, when?

You girls wanna hear a poem? - You know a poem? - Hey listen, there one was a man from Kent, his lance was uncommonly bent- (shushing Goldie) so to avoid any trouble, he put it in double, so instead of cumming, he went. (Vinnie laughing) - Can't you see these are college girls! - That is a funny poem. (girls chuckling) - So, do you like poetry? (somber music) - Sure. - Do you live in the Village? - Nah, in Brooklyn. - [Woman] Delmore. - Delmore. (indistinct muttering) - [Woman] Delmore!

Tony can do that? - No, I can jerk my own weight. - You can't even jerk your own dick. - Oh, you've tried, huh? - What can I say? - You know what the trouble is here. They've got the girls and we don't. Why? - One's Francis and Theresa. - I mean, come on and take a look at them, and then look at us. - You look at them. Who wants to look like a hood. - Hey Fred, you want a Coke? - Yeah, okay. Listen guys. The first thing that impresses a girl is the way a guy walks, not the black leather jacket Pat.

You make sure you tell your father about us. These guys look like the guys that creamed that big thug. What was his name, O'Halloren or somethin'? - Oh, yeah, yeah. You know, he had a suit down Lucci Luciano and insults him. Luciano doesn't even bat an eye. Just sits there, finishes his lunch, he even has one of them, um, (indistinct) with him. - Yeah, three weeks later these two guys, dressed just like that, straight from Sicily, go to where O'Halloran eats his lunch everyday. You know, that automat on 57 Street in Manhattan? Bam! There was blood and nickles everywhere. (piano music continues) Just as he was gettin' his coconut custard pie.

So do you go through this often? - No. - Where did you get that? - Stupidity. - I was wearing my older brother's jacket, some kids thought a school jacket was a gang jacket, I was stupid too. They asked me into the hallway for a cigarette. - How old were you? - 13. - 13 year olds did that? - No! They were a lot older than me. One of the big guys kicked me in the face when I went down, only actually I never went down. It'll never happen again. I remember going home that night, and sticking my hand in ice water, trying to make it go away, my eye was swollen shut. - Why do you go to school there? Did you feel scared today. - No, just stupid. - I didn't feel scared, not then, but I do now, why? - Sometimes it was just so quick that it takes a while for the feeling scared to catch up with you. - Quickly, it happened so quickly. (soft instrumental music) You have a beautiful house. - Thank you, you wanna see it? - Sure! Oh, you got a stereo? - You want to hear something? You're going to need another shirt.

(upbeat synth music) (water whooshing) (roars) (soft piano music) (muffled scraping) (lips smacking) - Is there a subway? - Yeah, the New Haven railroad, but you don't have to go. - I think I should, I think my parents might be worried about me. You can just point me in the direction, I can get there on my own. - It's all right, just give me a minute I'll get dressed, and I'll take you myself. (soft piano music) - What happened when you and that girl last night, did you do it? - No, she's a good girl. - Hey, what are you crazy? Girls that do it all are good girls, very good girls, right Vin? (laughing) - What are you reading, the sport section? The theater section (indistinct). - Hey Bic, what are you gonna do about Mitsy? - Mitsy titsy who gives a shitsy?

(flushing) (door creaks open) I can't believe he wouldn't turn this off. - I can't believe he didn't wash his hands. - Come on, (indistinct) let's go. Come on, come on! Come on! Hey, stand up, who told me to sit down? Come on, I need to know four things from you. What's the name of your gang? - What gang? Who are your gang members, why were you fighting, and who shot Patatango? - It's Patakango! - Hey don't correct me, sit down! You want to play? Huh, we'll play, (indistinct) for a while. - Let's have a little gang talk? - I ain't got no gang man, you're crazy. - Let's go, I got to train to catch. - All right, a little taste test time. Find out what you punks like. First we start with water, it's cool and refreshing. Now, you see this one, this is sweet. And this one, huh? This is (indistinct). (clanks) This one, (laughs) this one is sour! What's the name of your gang? I know you're the ringleader. - Listen, we told you we don't have any gang. (smacking) (Bic grunts) Come on, son, you just tell us the name of your gang and then you can go. Come on, open up punk. (smacking continues) Look, what happened, there is this new girl at school, and she said something to another girl, and she didn't like what she said. - Bullshit! - It's true. - Bullshit! - It's true. There's no gangs, there's no gang wars, there's nothing. And I don't know who the shot Patakango. (smacks) (grunts) If you punks don't open up, you're going to be shit. - You're gonna touch me with that, man, and if you do, then hit me all the way to the Statue of Liberty.

No, there are no gangs at this school. What would you have done? Fine, next time I'll call the board of education. - Detective Mayor of the 72nd Precinct, said that the gang warfare involved two local gangs; the Philistines and the Cougars. However, the Alexander Hamilton Rides were proceeded by the shooting of a Hamilton Sr. This has led to the speculation that the problem may run deeper involving larger city-wide gangs. - Who the heck of the Philistines and the Cougars? Where did they get this shit from? - From me, I made it up. Pat, don't lean. - You stupid, what for? He'll fucking hit the roof when he reads this. Look, I would have told them my mother's sucks, if that would have made him stop. Pat, I said don't lean on my back. - How could you talk about your mother that way? - Shut up, Vinnie! - What? You know, the cops beat up my cousin once. They did, they wrapped T-shirts around their fists so they wouldn't leave marks.

Why can't just tell me what happened with the cops. - Get out of here, what happened with the cops? - Patakango said the cops beat you. (rushed footsteps pattering) (heavy footsteps pattering) - That's the kind of behavior that make people believe the newspapers. The talent show is coming up, and some of the faculty felt that you and Cougar would make good choices and run it, don't let us down. - But come on, can we say no? - No. First you recruit help, that should be easy for you and Cougar. I understand you two have natural leadership qualities. (laughing) Then you make posters, sign up to help, put on a show, it's easy. That's it. You're in show business kids, and the principal says, "No rock and roll." I repeat no rock and roll. - And this whistle? - Well, blow it when you're in trouble, but only if you're in deep trouble.

And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? - What was that? - I don't know. - He's crazy. - Look, I gotta get out here, I got to find Bic. (muffled scraping) - Hey- (laughing) Hey! We're stuck! Man, come on, get it off of me! Get my (indistinct). - Just know he could... - Very funny! - Very funny! (train rumbles) - Bic, what are you doing up here? Cougar is looking for ya! You okay? You wanna see what I made? (whooshing) (footsteps pattering) Neat, huh? It works like this. Pull the pin, bam! Neat, huh? I don't have any more ammo, Patakango and I tested it. It really worked. - Patakango? - It really worked. No! (clinking) Hey! Hey, who threw this? (gate clanging) Who threw it? - Why the hell are we such bums? Who the fuck sets it up like this anyways? - You're not a bum if you can fight back. - Yeah, right! People learn to respect you. - That's bullshit! We spent 4 years in the school, and the only thing we learned how to do is crack heads, that's great, we're not bums. - There's nothing wrong with learning to take care of yourself, right? - No, there isn't. But there is something wrong with being ashamed of who you are. - I'm not ashamed of anything. - No, you're not, you're just like Bic, except maybe Bic is not so sure he wants to be just like Bic any longer. Are you? (somber music) - The talent show, that's what I'm going to miss about this school. The shows, I always feel proud of those. - Yeah, right! - Why is everybody so sad? What are we doing up here? We've go a show.

School was funny, the bell rings on that last day. Everything that brought you together it evaporates. Was I wasting time in school with Devlin? I don't think so. But that was my hometown, Brooklyn. I don't know what happened to most of the guys, Freddie really did become a cop, a good one, and Vinny Vinny became a carpenter, his uncle got him in the union. Last I heard he was making $80,000 a year. And Carmen, well, Carmen heads a conglomerate, specializing in toxic waste removal.
