... Soft music with Chinese notes ... ... ... ... ... *A Beautiful Morning (The Rascals) ... - Are you going back to bed? -I can't, my coach is coming. Don't you have your supervisory board this morning? -Oh, shit! I had completely forgotten ! He's laughing. So used to not giving a fuck anymore. -You who was afraid to be bored. Laughing mockingly ... He sighs. ... He urinates with difficulty. ... -One. And two. Until the end, stretching. Come on, a ... -Hello, Mehdi. -Good-morning Paul. - Will I come back and get you in 1 hour? -Do not bother, Carole picks me up. -We are going to work the hamstrings and the glutes. The door slams. -No ! ... -... in particular our factories in Spain and Algeria are growing strongly. Our figures are achieved and we hope an increase still in double digits. -So, excuse me, I'm cutting you off. But on the near-eastern area, namely, Cyprus, Israel and Egypt ... ... The birds sing. -I tell you that you should take your 7 iron. - Leave me alone. -As you wish. Disapproving exclamation Cry of a bird -And shit! -You see ! Why aren't you listening to me? -But it's my osteoarthritis. -You would have listened to me, there would be no osteoarthritis that holds. -Paul ! It's yours. -I arrive. -It's not true ! It will be dark. Mocking laughter He blows. - Between osteoarthritis and the prostate, you have to prick yourself. -I still have beautiful leftovers. 5 euros that I arrive directly on the green. -deal. -You should take your iron #7. disapproving Laughter (-Yes...) And here is the work! -Good game. -My champion. You see it's not the iron. Laughs -Three weeks. We do Los Angeles-Tokyo, Tokyo-Beijing and Beijing-Paris. -If you go through Beijing, you must call Tanguy! He will give you addresses. -Give me his email. - Shall we get something back? -We won't hang around if we want to go shopping. -What's to eat at home? -Nothing. Mocking laughter - At least that's clear. -I don't know why I'm asking, there's never anything. -It's not wrong, it pisses me off to cook so much. -It's the same for me. -Is that so ? -It is true ? - Shall we have a restaurant? -Ah yes ! -Why not. -No, we are finishing season 2 of The Affair . - You haven't seen her? -No. - Years that we wanted to see him. We saw season 1 and almost all of season 2, yesterday and the day before yesterday. -It's great, isn't it? -GREAT. -And when Noah ... - Shut up, don't say anything. -I will pay. -We share. * Horn (-You think ...) (-Wait ...) * The series is in English. *... -Easy on the vodka. Intercom Ben... *... He turns off the television. -Yes ? I can barely hear you. Who is here ? -Who is it? -I dunno. Hello? * ... *-Mom ! -Tanguy ! Intriguing music with Chinese notes ... -What is happening ? -Mei-Lin left me. -Oh my God, that's not true. -No kidding ? -And. She left. -Oh, my poor darling. Are you coming straight from Beijing? -What happened ? -Come on. Let's not stay there. Take care of the luggage. -I will help you, Polux. - My poor darling, you must be exhausted. You will tell me everything. Did you have dinner? -In the plane. - Go and sit in the living room, my darling. I arrive. Soft music Zhu and Paul discuss. Sigh of effort ... here you have. -Thank you. Sigh of effort - Blow your nose. -She weighs heavy. What is in there? -Dad's books and my school stuff. -You don't want to eat anything? -No thank you, Mamé. I'd like to take a shower. -Of course my dear. Take the guest bedroom bathroom . -And the apartment on the landing? -It's bad, we rented it ... Sigh You come only in summer, normally. -Is this The Affair ? -YES ! -Is it after Noah killed Scotty? -he kills Scotty? -Ah damn. Sorry. -We weren't really watching. Come on, I'll give you some towels. Are you not too offbeat? -Yes, a little, but it's okay. She blows. - Didn't you see anything coming? -Non. She was business as usual. -And then ? - 2 days ago, she told me that she had met someone and that she was going with him. -Like that? Direct? Outraged exclamation -Do you know who it is ? - What does that change, anyway? -So she told you that and then? -And then nothing. (crying) She's gone. - Maybe it's just a passing fancy. -No. It's over, she told me. -My poor darling. What did she say to Zhu? -Minimum... That she loved him, but was leaving. My whole life is falling apart. - Don't cry, big boy. -My poor love. We open a door. Zhu clears his throat. My darling, are you feeling better? -Yes, it feels good. -You don't want to eat anything? -No thank you, Mamé. -Do you want to go to bed after these emotions? Do you mind sleeping on the sofa? Your father takes the guest room. -Of course. -Thank you darling. -It's normal, dad. Come. You've had a rough day. -Good night. -Good night, my boy. -Good night. (in Chinese) -I put your vanity in the bathroom. -Thank you darling. -I'm going to make your bed! -Just put me a sheet and a quilt, I will. -She has guts, the little one. Exclamation of amazement He's in such bad shape ... I've never seen him like this. -I can't believe it! I wouldn't have believed that of her. -Neither do I. He's never gonna get over it. -Always in the shade. -She has gone mad or what? That she leaves Tanguy, I don't mind, but that she abandons her own daughter, it is shameful. If she gets dumped by her guy and wants him back, I won't let her. - Do not react hot, we'll see. -It's all seen. Slut. -Oh... Soft music with Chinese notes ... (-Close the door to not wake Zhu.) Did you manage to sleep? -I took something, but I woke up a lot of times. -It's normal, you have jet lag. - Shall I make you some orange juice? -I'd really like it, thank you. When I woke up I remembered she was gone it was horrible. - Here, they are very hot. -Thank you dad. Thanks Mom. -You don't eat? -I'm not very hungry. (crying) My life is ruined. -Do not talk nonsense. You have a wonderful daughter who loves you. -It is said to be the spitting image of Mei-Lin. -And you too! What she is pretty when she's not wearing her glasses. She should wear contact lenses. -We are here and we love you. -What will become of us? - You're not in a state to think about it now. You are not on the street. Let some time pass. -Tanguy, we must not let ourselves be defeated. We can't stop the black birds from flying above us, but we can prevent them from making their nests there. - Mom is right. Did you tell your job that you were leaving? And the French high school? We have to do it, Tanguy. Shall we do it together? Give me their email, I'll do it. Where are my glasses ? -Are they in the bedroom? -No. -I had them at the bakery ... Ah, not! They are there ! Intriguing music with Chinese notes Someone knocked. -Come in. ... -Look at what I found for you. Don't you want to try it? I'm making a machine, do you have other things? -I dunno. -The sleeves are a bit short, but it's okay. I have an invitation from the Guimet museum for this afternoon. I take Zhu. It might interest you. We are presented with a Buddhist manuscript written by two Chinese monks in ... 7th century. -I do not care. -Do you prefer to go golf with dad? -No I do not want to. -For tonight... you want me to make you a chicken broth the way you like? - Do what you want, mom. ... She sighs. ... -It is in a state ... -It's like mourning, it takes time. -I'm afraid he'll do something stupid. -Oh... -Do you prefer to play golf? I can stay there. -No, go ahead, that makes Zhu happy. Golf, I can go there every day. -You're sure ? -Certain. I have already warned them. We open the door. -Can I help you, Mamé? -It's nice, but I'm almost done. Tell me, darling, have you heard from your mom? -No and I don't want to talk about it. -As you want, but if you need, don't hesitate, we're here. Didn't he cut off his head? -He said it tasted good. -It's disgusting. You go back or you cut it, but I don't cook that, it disgusts me. -I will do it, Mamé. -Thank you sweetie. -Delicious, your chicken broth, Mamé. -It's nice, sweetie. You haven't touched your plate ... -Yes. But I'm not very hungry. (in Chinese) -You should force yourself, dad. -I know, darling, but it's not working. -As you don't know yet if you are going to stay in France or return to Beijing, we said to ourselves that in the meantime, we had to educate Zhu. -She graduated in June. -I know... -We could register it at l'Alsacienne. -It would be perfect, for her. No ? -Yes. I dunno. -I would like to, dad. It's hard to work alone. -I'm calling early tomorrow. -Thank you, Polux. -Happy that you are there. I don't know what I would do without you. -If you can't count on your parents, then who? -You have finished ? -Yes thanks. -Thank you. -Don't shake, my darling. Here... -You find that normal that he came back to Edith and Paul with his daughter? -What did you want him to do? -Mei-Lin is leaving him. In 48 hours, he crashes his job, withdraws his daughter from high school and hop, direct to papa-mum. -He lost everything, poor man. It's normal for him to come back. -No, not in France, with his parents, it's not the same. -She talks about Alien. -When we know the bestiau, we can at least ask the question. The television is on. Water is flowing. * -This little bunny is made of 10 pieces of chocolate nested within each other. * -So here, we are sticking with a small white chocolate cone , all the little things that we cut out. It is a work of superposition. Once... -Good evening, Mamé. I present to you Louise and Maxime. My grandmother. -GOOD EVENING MADAM. - I can't shake your hand. -Can I help you ? -It's nice, don't bother. Is your father here? -He watches TV in your room. Do you mind if we work here? We have a presentation to prepare. - Not at all, on the contrary. We open a door. He urinates. He stops urinating. He sighs. He urinates again. ... He blows. Zhu and his friends are talking. ... -Sympathetic, this youth. -She's amazing, Zhu. She already has friends. -She won't let down. If Tanguy could do the same. -Should compare what is comparable. -I ran into the Corcos, they're coming to dinner. -Oh no. -If there is for 4, there is for 6. And Tanguy eats nothing. -But it will still bring us until no time. And with Zhu sleeping on the couch ... It's not possible. Don't you want to cancel them? Next time with pleasure, but hey ... -Well... -How did it go at the urologist? -Oh fuck ! I completely zapped. - You worry me right now. You forget everything. -I have Alzheimer's. -No, but resume your appointment immediately or you will forget again. - Good evening, my big one! (-Good evening dad.) -So... Someone is practicing on the piano. ... The door slams. Key ringing -Slept well ? Boy, you can take a bath with us and watch TV, but ... Be careful. There were crumbs everywhere. And you broke my book with your can. - Sorry, dad, I'm completely west. Excuse me, I'll buy you one back. -But no. It is not serious. -Thanks Mom. She sighs. -Tell me, my darling ... Still no news from Mei-Lin? -No. She's not responding to my emails. -If it's over, it's normal. -She could answer, she's not dead. -But, assuming she doesn't change her mind, do you have any idea what you're gonna do -Non. I still can't believe it. Doorbell -I go. Ah, hello, Mrs. Hendricks. -Hello, Mr. Guetz. I'm sorry, I have bad news. -Ah. -My management called me last night, I have to return the apartment to you sooner than expected. They send me to Hanoi. -If that's it, don't worry, it suits me. My son has landed and we are a bit cramped. Meow -But what are you doing here? I can't take her. They eat the cats over there. Exclamation of disgust Don't you want a cat? -My son is allergic to cat hair. -Ah... Thank you very much for your welcome. -You're welcome. Have a good day and have a good Hanoi. Meow -What am I going to do with you? -I have a good new ! Intriguing music with Chinese notes -You will be quieter! Oops, sorry, Kader! Especially you, my poor Zhu. - "Who is satisfied with little has all the desired qualities." - It will be more practical. -Kader is going to drop an allergenic bomb. -To do what ? -Because of the cat. - Was there a cat? -She had a cat. Kader will drop the bomb. Are you all right, Kader? - All is well, madam. Quiet. ... A book falls. -Ah darn. ... Soft music ... -Hello Darling. Did you sleep well ? -Way. I couldn't breathe. I sneezed. -Kader has to hand over the bomb? -No, I can do it. She sighs. -What are these splendid flowers? -It's for you. -That's too nice. Should not. Oh ! -L'Alsacienne then the apartment. They came across the colocynth. -Zhu was sleeping in the living room. It is timely. -They have no memory. He's not about to leave. -It was over 15 years ago! -It doesn't change anything, it's in his DNA. He's glued to their sneakers. -You don't tell them? -You know Edith. I don't want to get angry with her. -There are the champions. Mocking laughter -I should have stopped, I played like shit. Sigh -There is no rush, but ... I will not cut the operation. -How long ? - For me to see. When I'm tired of pissing every quarter of an hour. -Do not wait too long, you will be rid of. -Mamé is right, Polux. You risk painful prostatitis. We open a door. The door slams. -Come sit down, my darling. We started without you Zhu has to go to work at Louise's. -Good evening darling. -Good evening dad. -Where were you ? -With Bruno. -Bruno Lemoine? -Yes. - Did you see him again? That's right. -Yeah. It reminded me of the past. -Bruno, he's your friend forever! -He's also my wedding witness. - Can I leave the table? It will be late. -Of course my dear. - Do you agree, Tanguy? -Of course. -See you tomorrow. -Works well. -Don't forget your toothbrush. -Yes, Mamé. -The grief should not make you forget your responsibilities. It's your daughter, not ours. The door slams. -You're right, I suck. -No, but you have to fight. - I can't go back up the slope. -You'll get there, you 've got your whole life ahead of you. -Why you don't find yourself a job? It would save you from going in circles. -I know. -Do sport ! Why don't you worry? -Dad is right. It clears your head. It would do you a lot of good. -Why not tennis? Or try golf. I'm sure you would like it. -When I see the tenderness you show for me, I tell myself that I am lucky in my misfortune. Leave it, mom. I will do it. -What is that ? -Tanguy bought you your book. -It wasn't worth it, but it's nice. Shall we play golf tomorrow? -I can not. Mehdi comes at 10 a.m. And my shoulder is making its own anyway. -We are getting old, eh. -After 50 years, if it hurts anywhere ... -You're dead. Loving laugh Playful music ... Someone knocked. -A moment. Come in. Tanguy ? What are you doing here ? -I came home so I'm coming to see you. You're okay ? -Like an old man soon to retire. -You're not old. -Stop your bullshit. You got a little harder, but you haven't changed. -A little less hair. -Oh yeah. -M. Delerme is there? -He died in February. -No ! - Broke in his youth at 87 years old. And apart from the joy of seeing me again, why are you here? -Wouldn't you have a job for me? -I knew it. Noelle will try to find this for you. It's good to see you again. -5 hrs / week and maybe more after. -It's great, my darling. -That puts you back in the stirrup. -A fund. -The students who are going to have you are lucky. -I am not sure. I have the pépettes. -I'm sure it will go very well , sir. -You can call me Tanguy. - Do you know China, Maxime? -My parents were born there, but never took me. But as soon as we passed the bac, I pay myself the trip. -This is good. -You will love it. We've been lucky enough to go there every year for ... 16 years old, eh! -What do you want to do after graduation? -Medicine. -Like Zhu. -No, I want to do some research. -Ah! That's right ! I open another one? -I think it's going to be fine, right? You have finished ? -I will do it, Mamé. -I will help you. -He's nice, this kid. Exclamation of approval -Mollo, Bruno, please. I said soft! -40-0. here. Thu. 6-0. -At least, I don't use the cord. -Hello. -Hello how are you ? -Good thanks. -Do you know who it is ? He's your ex's husband. -Daisy ? No kidding ! What is she becoming? -yoga teacher. 2 kids with that asshole. He's stupid like a broomstick. In my opinion, she pisses him off badly. -She never knew how to choose her guys. -Oh, that ... - Do you have the tickets? -No it's you. -No, I gave them to you. -Oh yes it's true ! Shit ! Embarrassed laughter -You are worrying me. A door opens. -Oh, you tire me out. - I shower and I arrive. -We're not having dinner there. We're going to the theater. -Is that so ? -And Chu isn't here, either? - She's at the movies. With Louise and Maxime. It will be fine ? -Yes Yes. I'll manage. Good night. He's opening the door. -It's not yet Olympic shape. -Oh. She sighs. Playful music ... Horns Little laugh He whistles. ... -It's Pierre and Émile. -They are beautiful. Both. They look like you. -You find ? -Yes. This is my daughter Chu, finally, Zhu. -She is pretty as a heart. -The portrait of his mother. -She left you overnight? -After 16 years of living together. -My poor. -It's life. -What will you do now ? -I live for my daughter. I'm waiting for her to be big, after ... - Don't say nonsense. Where do you live ? -At my parents. -They are fine ? -In great shape for their age. Vibrator Are you not answering? -He's my husband, I'll call him back. -Do you want to drink something? -You will have made him go crazy, that one ... - I was not aware of it. We are cruel when we are young. - Is she still so pretty? -Always. - Can I go to work at Louise's, dad? We have a math test tomorrow. -Of course my dear. -Good night. -You too. -Good night. -Good evening, sweetie. -Where does she go ? -Revise at Louise. - What does she work for. -That's why she's 1st in her class. -Like her mother. -And like you especially. - Do you have any news? -No. She still does not answer my emails. -She carries! It is mental cruelty. -I would be you, I would give up on it. Won't you spend your life waiting for it? -With time, I thought I could see more clearly ... But it is the reverse. The more it goes, the more I am lost. -And Marguerite, are you going to see her again? -I dunno. -But yes, leave him alone. -Well. Are you taking us to dinner? I'm sick of making food. -Let's go ! - I'll get my jacket! -She was good, this girl. -Don't dream. -No, I'm just saying she was fine. -You lived there a long time? -16 years old. -Ah yes. -And you don't miss it? -I like above all to transmit, no matter the place. -Excuse me, ladies. - It doesn't say anymore, we say "ladies". -Do as you like. I can talk to you ? -GOOD BYE, SIR. -You don't change. - What do you imagine? -Only stuff that I've seen before. I arranged your cans for you. I moved your class from Friday to 11 a.m. -It's nice, thank you! -What will you do now ? Are you staying in France, are you going back to Beijing? -I dunno. The more time passes, the less I can see clearly. -You have no plans, wishes? - My daughter only keeps me going. I'm waiting for her to be big, after ... - You're not the first to whom this happens. One fine day, without you expecting it, you will fall in love again. -Perhaps. -It's certain. -But yes. -It made me happy to see you again. -US TOO. -You came in Autolib '? -No choice, there are three of us. - Me, I didn't want to. Most have semen stains on the seats. -Non ? -People use it to fuck. -Disgusting. - More than to hope that ours is an exception. -It makes him laugh, that idiot. - Kiss Zhu for us. -I'll do it for sure. -Come for dinner next week. -We can't, we're going to Beijing. Tanguy, do you have any restaurant addresses? -I'm sending you this. - Come on! Ciao ! - "Little children, little worries. Big kids, big worries. " -They haven't finished having them. He said it. The more time passes, the less he can see clearly. They have it for 100 years. -But no. - I'll sign it for you. -20 written, 19 oral. -We know, Mamé. -I can say that I am proud of my granddaughter. -How many points is that ahead? -56. -56 ? You will have it with honors. - "When we have 10 steps to take, 9 go halfway." -What do you plan to do after the baccalaureate? -Medicine. -With similar notes in French? -She has the same in math and physics. -Mazette! -Do you think of a specialty? -Geriatrics. -Geriatrics... - "Give back the care you received young, it is a debt that you pay. Your children will learn it then pay it back to you. " -Confucius. - Anyone wanting more sauerkraut? -No thanks. -Never refill, it's the secret of my line. -I don't mind, Mamé. -You look like your mom. -I jump from rooster to donkey ... You saw the price of the contributions for next year? They don't care about the world! - I'll go play at Fourqueux. -Excuse me, I feel bad. I'm going to bed. -It's not okay ? -I am sorry... You don't blame me? Good night. -Did I say something stupid ? Edith sighs. ... Bells Loud music in headphones *... -Tanguy ? *... -You gave me one of those scares! -I thought you went to bed last night. -I was lying down. But Bruno called me. He insisted, insisted that I join him in a bar. It was bad. -It was bad? He nods. Until 6 a.m.? ... -I'm exhausted, I'm going to bed. Good night mom. Disturbing music with Chinese notes ... -Paul. Paul ! He blows. -What time is it ? -6 h. Tanguy had supposedly gone to bed, he went out until 6 a.m. with Bruno. -So what ? He is 44 years old. - Do you find that normal? He was down 36 last night. -It is that he is better. -Exactly. Much better than he claims. Mei-Lin's departure hit him hard, but it suits him well to be with mum and dad. He sighs. - Do we have to talk about it now? -I am scared. He's been here for 3 months and when we ask what he wants to do, he doesn't know, it's too early, I don't know what else ... I'm sure he's playing comedy on us. He is well at home. -Because he's out, he's acting? -You do not understand. He has found the nest. He hasn't changed, Paul! Intriguing music - We see that tomorrow? ... -We have it until the end of our days. Serious funny notes ... Edith sighs. A door opens ... and closes. -Already? -Yes, I have a class at 10 a.m. -You will be fresh ... -Is there no orange juice? Anyone want one? -NO THANKS. The juicer starts up. ... -It is really nice, this apartment. I think I prefer it to the old. Edith almost suffocates. -The other was exceptional, Tanguy. -Yes... He was taller, it's true. This one is more intimate. -But the view? You remember it ? -Exactly. We feel more protected. Like in a cocoon. I love you dad. - Me too, my chicken. -And I love you, mom. -I love you too. -Promised? -Promised. Edith almost suffocates. Playful music ... This is not possible ! You haven't seen my sweater with ... The blue that I wear all the time to go golf, with ... Diamonds! -He came back... We have it until the end of time ... - "The one who, inside, is without deception or error and outside knows neither calamity nor plague, the one whose mind ... " (-Hey!) (Do you know who it is ?) -Non. (-It's the one who lived with his old people.) (-Is that him?) (-Yeah.) (-Wesh, the bastard.) (Is he still at home?) (-It would surprise me.) (-You don't know, he's a genius.) (-It is true.) - "They call him the sage." -That's good, Pablo. Very good. A door opens ... and closes. -Good evening mother. Good evening dad. -It's my sweater! -Is that so ? -Yes, that's mine! Oh ! -Sorry... Mei-Lin had offered me almost the same. -Thank you. -I beg your pardon. -Help me set the table. Tell me, time goes by, have you made a decision? -Stay in France or go back to Beijing? I don't know ... My life has changed ... -We understand, but ... In the event that Mei-Lin does not return ... -You think ? -It's a guess. What are you doing ? -I dunno... You said that a breakup is like mourning it lasts a year. -You plan to stay here for a year? Edith almost suffocates. -I dunno. There, I have the feeling of being a burden for you. Notice, I understand you. Have a 44 year old son who comes back to daddy-mom with his daughter, it's not glorious. Poor Chu, she didn't deserve this. A door slams. (-Cinema ...) Throat clearing -Good evening. -Good evening. You had a good day ? -I got 20 in English. -Congratulations. - Where are your glasses? -How do you find? I tried lenses. I have a week to make up my mind. So ? -Much better. -It changes you. -You are even more beautiful. - Glad you like it. I'm hungry, can I help you, Mamé? She nods. Screams of pleasure ... The screams intensify. ... -What is that ? -According to you ? - What's he doing in the guest room? - Go ask him. Funny music Screams of pleasure ... He bangs on the door. -A second. I woke you up ... -In your opinion? - I didn't want to disturb Chu. -We, is it not a problem? -Good evening, Paul. -Marguerite, how are you? -Very well and you ? -Oh, we hold on. -You look great. -You haven't changed. -Thanks, that's nice. Excuse me, I have to go. Nice to have seen you again. Kiss Edith. -I'll do it for sure. -You call me. - Looks like you are turning the page Mei-Lin. -I try to forget him in the arms of another. But I do this with a married woman. -Because she's married? -Yes. Like that, there is no risk. - Of the risk of what? -To start my life over with someone else. In case Mei-Lin comes back. Funny music with Chinese notes Paul sighs. -You're right, Edith. We're getting bloated. -What is happening ? -We need to talk. - I suspected it. -It's not going to start again, Tanguy. There is no way we will relive what we experienced 16 years ago. It's a good memory for anyone. -No one. -So do what it takes before it escalates. -It's true, it's not a good memory. Give me time to turn around. - Did you understand me correctly? -5 out of 5, dad. I have to find a real job and especially look for an apartment. I have cut out. I'll have breakfast outside. He is about to speak. And thanks for talking to me with this frankness. Have a good day. A door opens. - I hope he understood. -Me too. I can hardly see myself fighting against him again. I have passed the age. -And I therefore. The doors slam. -Bye Madam. -Goodbye. Mermaid ... -There was an accident ? -Roselyne had a heart attack. -Zut, she's young though. - Tobacco, cholesterol, divorce. Astonishing she hadn't done one sooner. Do you want to replace her? -Is it a full time? -Nearly. -Non. My daughter passes the bac in June, I want to watch over her. -OK, I'll ask Franck. -If she hasn't come back in September, let me know. Hello Mom. Dad, I've been to the bakery before. And I took the newspapers. Phone ring -Yes, hello, it's me. Why did you show me around then? Never mind. Thank you. Goodbye. He sighs. The only possible apartment of those I saw is rented. I have to start over. But there is nothing on the market and the smallest thing, the prices are exorbitant. -You'll end up finding it. -It is not won. On the other hand, I found a full-time job at Languages-O. -When would you start? -Only downside, not before September. It's already that. Not to mention that I have other leads. I stick to it. Have a good day. We hit the ball. -What a great return! - Soon you will beg me to leave you a game. -You still have work to do. -I said "soon". 0-30. Screams of pleasure ... -No it is not possible ! Funny music ... Tanguy ! Who are you kidding? Cover yourself, Marguerite, I will come in. Serious funny notes - Who is Marguerite? - Sorry, it's my fault. I was afraid that we would disturb Tanguy.

Do you think this has been going on for a long time? -Since she's been studying at his house, I guess. -You're right. But we're idiots! That's the glasses, of course. She hides her game well too. What a fake ass! - Looks like his father. -Dogs don't make cats. Desperate exclamation -I would have preferred that you tell me about it rather than learning it from Polux and Mamé.

He inhales. ... He sneezes again. He sighs. A door slams. -Slept well ? - My back hurts right now. -It's normal, you do no sport. -Well, I play tennis. -Once from time to time. You are 44 years old, you are not very young anymore. You have to talk. -Why don't you ride a bike? -Is it good for the back? -Excellent! Better than tennis anyway. And take Zhu.

"Whoever closes his door is at the bottom of the deserts." -All couples know that. It's part of life. Whether we want it or not. -We have known that too. If we had done everything at the time, we wouldn't be happy today. A couple is played out over time. He hesitates. (in Chinese) -I'm ready. -Let's go. The door opens... and closes.

Now that she is pregnant, they will stay. Intriguing music (in Chinese) -I thought mom gave you recommendations? - It's no accident, dad. Maxime and I love each other, we want to start a family. -You are young, you know nothing of life! Why don't you finish your studies first? -We know that we can do both at the same time. It's euphoric. -Euphorizing ... What do you think, you? -You know what I think about it. I do not worry about their future, they will have their baccalaureate hands down. -We submitted scholarship files for the rest of our studies. -And then, we'll be there to help them. There is no age to start a family. They love each other, that's the most important! -So ? - "The moment that chance gives you better than the time you would have chosen. " -Yes ! They laugh. -You know the rest. You will miss your baccalaureate, Maxime will leave you because he will want to look elsewhere, you will stay alone with your offspring, you will only have lousy jobs and you will have missed your life. And your child will hate you. This is what will happen to you. -You are not encouraging. - We have to tell you the truth. It's for your own good. -What do Maxime's parents think? -We're having dinner with them tonight. -I hope they will be more reasonable. They speak in Chinese. ... Soft music ... -Thank you.

Difficult breathing We are going to sleep ? -Yes, let's go to bed, yes ... -Good night. -GOOD NIGHT. - "Lovely parents. (imitating him) Very happy baby. " -We do not care. Let them keep their offspring. They will only have to open a tobacco. She sighs. -And that's not all! There are a whole bunch of things. After giving birth, you shouldn't wash for a month! -A month without washing? -But it's disgusting! -You have no choice, it's tradition! -No ! I do not go a month without washing! -You have to.

We have considered taking you with us. -It's nice, my darling. But we will be better at home. -At our ages, we have our little habits. We don't like change. -I know. So we returned our apartment and we all come back to our house. -Ah not. She is breathing hard. -When all is well, the others are there. When things go wrong, you can only count on your family. Mermaid - Watch out for the stairs, eh. -And a folding screen, for moments of privacy. A nurse will drop by for the injection every morning at 11 a.m. Does your schedule suit you? They nod shyly. And Mei-Lin and I will be there most of the time. Maxime and Chu too, since they have their revisions. You will be like roosters in paste. -Coosters in paste. -You can count on us. -Ah, I forgot.

Carole laughs. Yes. -And. The TV is on. -Good evening, Mamé. Good evening, Polux. Did you have a good day ? -Can you pass me the gun, please?
