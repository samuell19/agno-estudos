Welcome. Sorry, I didn't see you. May I help you? Did you make a reservation? What are you listening? Uh, it's Korean music. Can I? Yeah, of course. How long do you want to stay? Mm... I don't know yet. But, uh, three nights? It's okay? It's as you wish, of course. I need your passport, please. Thanks. But you're French! RETURN TO SEOUL - Cheers! - Cheers! Ah! Is it good? So, Freddie, do you really know nothing about Korea? Nothing. -What are you going to do? -Uh, I don't have any plans. Nonetheless, Freddie, what would you like to see during your stay? Everything. Is that possible? -Not in two weeks. -No? Totally impossible. It's funny hearing you speak French. - Oh. - Ah! No, you mustn't. -Really? -Let others refill your glass. Why? It's insulting otherwise. It would mean your friends aren't treating you right. Insulting? For whom? Mm... for both. Is this your mother? My biological mother, yes, I think so. It's all I have of Korea. A few years ago, there was a TV programme... What was it? The Morning Court? Not that, the other, older one. -I Want to See This Person? -Yes, that. Uh, it was a popular programme where adoptees met up -with their parents. -Actually, it's... What is it called in French? A play on words. In Korean, it means both "I want to see this person" and "I miss this person." Your story brings to mind an old Mongolian poem... entitled Land of my Birth. Oh, yeah? Dongwan did comparative studies of French and Asian literature. Mm... I can't say it correctly in French, but it goes something like this: Land where, in summer The earth is like A carpet of flowers The song of the birds, of the land As far as the south This, all of this Is the land of my birth Wow! - Cheers! - Cheers! Oh. Tell me, Freddie, mm... do you know Hammond? Who is Ammonde? No, Hammond. It's the adoption centre. It's a very famous place in Korea. Okay, and...? Well, you could go there. Are you going to try and find your parents? No. Uh... why not? Do you know what sight-reading is? It's when you play a score for the first time. You have to be able to analyse the music in one glance, evaluate the danger and jump in. Are you a musician? I was, but that's not the point. There are signs all over that you don't see. But you can learn to read them and catch them when they appear. -What signs? -Fear, for example. Want to see? Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! Take a seat! - Can I? - Sit, sit! Soju first! Then cheers! Come on! - Where are you from? - Wait. Come on. Come on! Come on! They are my friends, Tena and Dongwan. Is that right? Dongwan. They're Koreans! So they speak Korean! You want to join us? - Is she your friend? - Uh, yes. And... has she had a lot to drink? She's had a few. What is she doing? She's bringing them over. - Hello! - Hello! Can you put chairs? Put the chairs too. And you, you can sit here. Yeah. - Come. - Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. - Hello! - Nice to meet you. Wait, move. -Do you know her well? -No, not at all. -Hello! -Hello! Like the guy with the fringe? Not bad, huh? -No? -No. One bottle of soju, please. No, no, no, two, two, two! Two bottles of soju and a plate of chicken feet! Your friend is very original. In what way? My name Jiwan. Where are you from? France. France? France! France? -France! -Yeah, yeah, yeah. France! Paris Baguette! It's a famous chain of Korean bakeries. She doesn't look French... Who cares? Let's toast. Cheers! Oh. She has a typically Korean face, doesn't she? She says your face is like a long-time Korean. - Long-time? - From ancient, ancestral Korea. She's right. You have pure Korean traits. I do? Thank you. I wish I could speak another language. Him also, original Korean! Shall we play a game? - Yeah, let's! - A game! Any ideas? Let's start with the song. Look at me. You see her. - Yeah. - We explain. Okay. You, hop, bunny, bunny. You send me, middle person, send me bunny, bunny. - Left! - Show her! Let's show her! -Again? -Again! - Look, see, okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. What's wrong? Did we sleep together? What? You and me, sex? Sex? Jeez, I can't remember. Do it again, is that okay for you? Sex, again, you and me, okay? Okay. Come. Watch where you're going! Um... do you have your adoption file? No. You don't have it. No, it's at my parents' place, in France. I see. Do you have your file number? No. Your birth name? Then Hammond cannot help you. You should have contacted us before coming. I, um... came to Korea sort of by surprise. What surprise? Could you come back another day with the copy of your adoption file? How long will you be staying in Korea? Two weeks. Two weeks. Hm... Uh... I do have this photo, which was in my file. There's a number on the back. Mm. Wait here. EVOLUTION OF INTERNATIONAL ADOPTION, 1958-2004 Sorry to have kept you waiting. I have your adoption file here, recorded in our system. This is a copy. Your birth name is Yeon-hee. I thought it was pronounced Yon-Ay. -Uh... -Does it mean anything? Mm. Docile and joyful. You stayed a few months at the Hammond in Jeonju before leaving for France. Your father dropped you off here. He also left his social security number and your biological mother's, in case you wanted to find them someday. He did? I have transferred this info to our services, uh, and they have found addresses for both your biological parents. Your mother lives in Jeonju and your father in Gunsan. Why did you do that? Uh... Mm... Uh, very often, adoptees who contact us want to find their biological parents. How does that work? I cannot give you their addresses, but we can send them a telegram. It's a standard message inviting them to get in touch with our services. Mm... if they do, we inform them that their child is trying to contact them. What if they refuse? Then the case is definitively closed for us. We are forbidden by law to contact them again. Do you wish to send a telegram to your biological parents? Hammond is on the phone. Hello, it's Frédérique Benoît. Yes, hello. Ah. Really? Uh, yes, wait. Zero, one, zero... seven, four, six, four... zero, six, five, one. Yes, I've got it. No, it's okay, I can see him alone. Yes, okay. Wait. What about, uh, my mother? I leave in ten days. Okay, thanks. Well? Do you want me to call him? Hello? Hello, sir, I'm a friend of your daughter. No, this isn't Hammond. I'm a friend of your daughter. Wait. He suggests you go to Gunsan this weekend. Because he works during the week, he can't come to Seoul. Wait. Well? Okay. Yes, that works for her. Driver? Driver! Driver! Mister! Driver, let's go back to Seoul! Driver! Let's go back to Seoul! Let's go back to Seoul! Let's go back to Seoul! Right now! Let's go back! Let's go back! Wait! Let's go back! Let's go back! Sorry. Sorry. You're insane! What's going on? - Are you okay? - Yeah, fine. You really scared me. -Sure you're okay? -I'm fine. You are family. Understand? We hope you will not judge us badly. The situation back then was horrible. Korea wasn't like it is today. We had no other choice. She's talking about why they gave you away. She says they regret it and asks you not to judge them. We thought about what would be best for you. We made this choice for your future. Tell Yeon-hee that we made this decision for her. They thought they were acting in your interest. Has she also met her mother? She wants to know if you're in touch with your Korean mother. That's not their business. What did Yeon-hee say? Yeon-hee's mother hasn't yet responded. Why can't you sleep here? It would be good if you could stay one night. They're sad that you won't be staying overnight. Tell her it's not possible. Thank you, but she says she will come back another time. Do you live in Paris? Yes. Paris, parents, together? No, I grew up in the countryside. And you? You also live in Gunsan? Gunsan? Me? No, no, no. Auntie, uh... Aunt live Seoul. Do you have a brother or sister? No. Are you married? No, I'm alone. I don't think she lives with her adoptive parents. She isn't married yet. Does she have a little time? I want to show her where I grew up. It's near the sea. Your father wants to take you to the place where he grew up. So you're going back to Seoul this evening? No, my parents live near Jeonju. We'll sleep there. But what do your parents do? My father is an employee in a company. My mother's a French teacher. That's how you learned to speak French? Yes. Does Yeon-hee understand Korean? Oh, no. I've just taught her a few easy words. He's asking if you speak Korean. Did she lack anything when she was growing up? He wants to know if you lacked anything in France. Tell him no. My parents took good care of me. She says her adoptive parents were good to her. Take a look. No. No need. See if there's anything you need. They're pretty. How much? I hate ballet shoes. That island is called Mouse Poop Island. We call it that because it's so small. When the tide is low, you can walk to the island, you don't need a boat. When I was a kid, me and my friends would spend afternoons fishing there. The adults had to come and get us by boat. They would bawl us out every time. But actually, fishing... is their whole life for the people who live here. My grandfather was a fisherman, my father was a fisherman, and I was, too, for a long time. Until they built the seawall. The biggest seawall in the world, they said on TV. Today, your father repairs air-conditioning units. Yeon-hee's mother's name is Son Mija. Your mother's name is Son Mija. We tried to live with my mother in Gunsan... but Mija preferred to go and live in the city, so she left. Your mother wanted to live in the city, so she left. Is that all? Wait. To this day... I never forgot Yeon-hee. I wondered... if she was alive, where she lived. He never stopped thinking about you. He wanted to know if you were alive and which country you were living in. My father has arrived, we're very late. Is there anything you want to do this evening? No, nothing. Just fall into your bed. It's your father. "Yeon-hee, I am so unhappy. I hope you now understand why I had to let you go. I regret the harm I have caused you. I cry every day since..." Tena. Stop, please. Eat. - It's delicious. - It's delicious! You are welcome here. I'm so happy that we can spend three days together. Your father say, "Welcome home. We very happy together three days." - Thank you. - Thank you! My wife and children knew nothing of your existence. Hm, I did not want to cause them sorrow. Not so fast, big brother, I will translate. Father no speaking about you because family sad. Yeah. Mm. But when I received the letter from Hammond, I told them everything. But Hammond called after everything speak, all speak about you. Why didn't you take hangwa cakes? See if there are any left. Take that. Um... is it, uh, my mom? Mija? Who is that? She must be the caregiver at Hammond. No. Uh... Nurse. Nurse. I don't have a single photo from back then. Uh, your photos, all lost. I'm sorry. FRÉDÉRIQUE SHORTLY AFTER SHE CAME TO US FRÉDÉRIQUE AND GRANNY GABRIELLE JULIE, FRÉDÉRIQUE AND MARTIN CHRISTMAS 1992 FRÉDÉRIQUE PLAYING THE PIANO That's enough. Children, go and get the video of the two of you dancing. We'll show it to your big sister. Go along. Sister dance video, show you. My Lord, thank you for having sent Yeon-hee to France so that she had the chance to get a better education. Thank you for having forgiven us all... and for having guided her to this house. I have always thought about Yeon-hee. Now I understand that it was the Lord's way. Thank you, my Lord. In the name of Jesus Christ, my almighty God. - Amen. - Amen. Grandmother say: "Thanks God, you send France for good education. Thanks God, forgive us and you come back Korea." Let's eat. Sister-in-law, you have worked hard. It looks good. Mmm. It's good. Good? Eat. Delicious. Can you ask him to stop sending me messages? He sends me every day messages in Korean. He even calls me at night, and I think he was really drunk and I didn't understand anything. Tell him that he has to stop. She's talking about the messages you sent her. Did you call her when you'd been drinking? I'd like you to come and live here with us. This is your home. I will help you to marry. Um... Father say you live Korea. Here is your home. He help ma-- You marry Korean man. He has to understand that I'm French now. Mm. I have my family and my friends over there. I'm not going to live in Korea. Okay. Okay. She says she doesn't want to live in Korea and that she's French. Tell her I understand. Your father understand. But everything will be easier for her when she learns to speak Korean. If you learn Korean, it will be easier. If you learn Korean, easy for you. EVERY TIME MY HUSBAND DRINKS, HE CRIES AND SPEAKS OF YOU. THE NEXT DAY, HE FORGETS EVERYTHING. I AM GLAD THAT YOU HAVE COME BACK. Welcome. Thank you. My baby. I am sorry. Sorry, my baby. Sorry, my child. Lord, make sure she has a happy life. My God, make sure that she is happy. Thank you for bringing her back. Thank you, Lord. Our Father... Tell her that I can drive her. Stop it. Hi, Mom. Hello, darling. I'm so happy to hear your voice. -How are you? -Can you see me? Yes, I see you fine. How's it going? Are you still in Seoul? Yes, in Seoul. Is it nice? Are you happy? What's it like? Uh, it's different. Everything's different here. Are things okay with Dad? Yes. He's going to be sad. He's just gone out. You should have warned us you were going to call. We called you loads of times. I know, but I couldn't call you back earlier. We worry, what with all these changes. I sent you text messages. But it's not the same. Sweetheart, could you explain the plane thing? Your father and I want to understand what you did. I just needed to go somewhere. But you've always loved Japan, Tokyo. Imagine our surprise when we got messages from Seoul. But why? Japan was no longer an option. You could have called, taken a moment to talk it over. Talk about what? I was told all planes to Tokyo were cancelled due to the typhoon. I told them I had to go because I had two weeks of holiday. The next flight they offered with the same company was to Seoul, so I took it. Is this really the way you want to tell me? We always said we would go together. Yes, I know. But, uh... But I think it's good that I came alone. I must go, Mom. I'm running out of credit. Already? Take care of yourself and write to us, okay? Yes, I will. Give Dad a kiss from me. Yes, I promise I will. All my love, darling. I don't understand the telegram thing. If you send a third telegram and there's still no reply, Hammond cannot send any more for at least one year. Or we would risk a complaint for harassment. Why not send someone? Or a registered letter? We're not even sure it's the right address. I'm sorry, but it's not possible. I leave in two days and will probably never come back. I want my mother's address. I understand, and I'm sorry. I'd really like to do more, but those are the rules. You protect the parents but not the children? I will ask you once again, Miss Benoît, do you wish to send the third telegram to your mother's address? What's wrong? Will you come and see me in Paris? Yes, I will. We'll go to the Lot region too. I'll introduce you to all my friends, and we'll walk through my favourite parts of Paris. I'd like to go to the Jardin des Plantes. Okay, we'll go. It's my father again. Message after message. I've had enough. Translate some insults for me. I'll send them to him. You shouldn't say that, Freddie. Why? He shouldn't write to me. It drives me mad. It's his way of communicating with you. By spewing his sorrow over me? It's the way of Korean men. But I'm French. You're also part Korean. Freddie. I want you stay Korea. What? You stay Korea. No go France. Why do they all want me to stay? You abandon your kids and after you ask them to become good little Koreans? What did she say? You have to understand-- This music is great. What is it? Tena. Gift. What is it? Tell him I don't want his gift. Open. I have a boyfriend in France. Boyfriend? Why do you say that? It's not even true. Tell her that I like her a lot... and that I'd like our encounter to become a deep relationship. Tell Freddie this is what the gift means. He says he loves you and that... I have a boyfriend in France. You understand? A boyfriend. Stop it, Freddie. You okay? Who cares? He'll get over it. Are you sulking? You're leaving too? I'll go and pay. My little Tena. You're a very sad person. Yeon-hee. Why don't you answer my calls? I called you and sent lots of messages these past few days. Why is it so hard to reach you? And what are you doing with a guy like this? You can't hang out with just anyone. You must not. You must not! Mija... It's all my fault. I was immature. Say something. Why won't you speak to me? Mija! Freddie? Tell him I never want to see him again. Yeon-hee thanks you for your concern for her. Yeon-hee! I... Say something. Please, let me see you again. Don't touch me! TWO YEARS LATER So, Freddie? So, André? -Shall we play? -Play what? I don't normally play. I'll start. First time in Seoul. Yes. Business trip. Five nights. Six. Married, three kids. I'm going through my third divorce. Four kids. -What are you doing here? -I came... for the armament fair. -You're a weapons dealer? -You could say that. That must be one crazy world. Or they make you crazy. Excuse me? A gin and tonic, please. They're great here. Two, please. Sorry, but wine makes me sleepy. Why did you "match" me, as you say? I like old guys. My turn? You're an artist. No. -Student. -No. What do you do, then? International consulting, in a French company. -And your clients are Koreans? -Yes. In a way, you are... a Trojan horse. My boss's exact words. Classic. If you must know, I wanted to fuck everything up today. -I know that feeling. -You do? -So how do you go about it? -I fuck everything up. Hear that? What? The music. What music? It's coming from inside. I love this song. I hear it. Ah. Thank you. I'm 27 today. I hate birthdays. I always ask myself the same question on my birthday. What question? Did my mother... think about me? Somewhere? Cheers. -Well? -Excellent. Tell me about the weapons. Weapons! Are you really interested? -Yes. -Weapons aren't the exciting part. It's the stakes you have to face. It usually ends in a hostess bar at 4 in the morning. There are only men in this profession, but you would be brilliant at it. Yeah? Why? Because you have to be able to not look back. Is this a booty call or a job interview? Shall we go to your room? -No dinner first? -I don't have time. Okay, then. But... I'm not 20 anymore. Hey. I need to pee. I thought you'd be back before midnight. Oh, sorry, I had a Tinder date. Had a good day? Yeah, fine. Did you finish it? - Yes. Want to see? - Sure. It's beautiful, Kay-Kay. I love it. You're sure? Yeah, I'm sure. You look tired. No, it's okay, I just need a ten-minute nap, and after, I'll be fine to go out. Surprise. Wait... Where are you going? You know I hate my birthday. I know. But they came for you. Please. Happy birthday! - You really fooled me earlier. - Sorry. Thanks. She's my little sister, Lucie. No, I'm not her little sister. Come here. - You okay? - I think I'm a little strung out. Aren't you going to open it? I'll open it tomorrow. There's a lot of people. Am I the only one from work? Ask Kay-Kay, but I hope so. What are you looking for? My bottle of... absinthe. I can't find it. Want me to help? Freddie? I've got an appointment with Hammond. How long have you been here? Three months. I told you to go there right away. But I was told not to rush into the first meeting with the biological parents. If there is a meeting. I was told to learn the culture, speak the language, talk to other adoptees. Come and see. What are you looking for? The toilets. Downstairs. What's wrong? My mother responded. Your biological mother? After six telegrams in two years. Today? No, ten days ago. A letter addressed to Hammond. She said she didn't want to see me. It was a short message. Twenty-two words. Thanks for the radish kimchi! I ate it all! What? Thank you for the radish kimchi! You did the right thing! YEON-HEE, WHERE ARE YOU? YEON-HEE, WHERE ARE YOU? IN KOREA? I WANT TO SEE YOU. I DON'T DRINK LIKE I USED TO. IF YOU'RE HERE, I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU. YEON-HEE, I SAW THEY TALKED ABOUT FRANCE ON THE NEWS. ARE YOU IN PARIS? KOREA? I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE. HAPPY BIRTHDAY! - Well, well, Freddie. -André. Already missing me? FIVE YEARS LATER Maxime. What should I wear? Do you think the dress is too formal? You're overthinking it. Go with your gut. No, seriously. Which do you prefer? Shit. What? We forgot your ballet shoes. Idiot! No, really, you haven't seen him for seven years, wear something comfortable. That's all. Come and see. Thanks for being here. Could you text my parents to say we've arrived? -Shouldn't you do that? -No, they love you. I have to call André. Okay. - Well? How are you feeling? -Okay, so far. It's funny to do something here again, huh? You're even more elegant than in Paris. -Do we go together tomorrow? -No. I'll go ahead to sort the file with the Koreans. -Okay. -No, wait. I assure you, they know you haven't made a decision. No one wants to force you. I told them our deal. Tomorrow is just a first meeting. No pressure. Yeah, I know your "no pressure." But they really like your profile. Know what the missile-division boss calls you? The James Bond Girl. - Okay, André. Bye. - Bye. This place is toxic for me. I'll need you. Don't worry. I'm here. I'm serious, Maxime. Delicious. This happened in France? No, in Thailand. We've got the accident there, so I decided to have the operation in Bangkok. The accident was in Thailand. But tell him it's nothing serious. And your friend okay? Oh, yeah. Only scratches. Uh... It's Freddie who was driving the scooter, of course. Look. Touch. Touch it. Why didn't you tell us? Eat. Eat. Um... I'm sorry for restaurant. I don't know you stop meat now. Oh, it's okay, it's fine. Don't worry. It's so good. Really. It's, um-- It's delicious. It's delicious! Yes. Thank you. Thank you. I don't drink alcohol. - Really? - No. No meat, no alcohol? No. It's not for ecological reasons, but, um, I never felt so good in my life. Yes or no? Alcohol, stop. Alcohol, stop? Alcohol, stop! Okay. Alcohol, stop? Okay. Tomorrow, no more. He'll stop tomorrow. Tomorrow, stop. He's changed since the last time. He almost looks younger. Weird. He looks like the photos you showed me. You think? Yes. I wish you had warned me earlier. It's a pity you're not coming to Gunsan. It's not possible. I came for work. You work here? I'm just here for a mission. What does she do? Uh, he ask, what is your job? Mm... I sell missiles. "Missiles"? She sells missiles. - Oh, missiles. - Missiles. I work for a French group, which collaborates with many other countries like Taiwan or Colombia. And we help them to improve their national defence system. She sells weapons to make war? For the war? No, for peace. In theory. And you come to Korea to sell missiles? Actually... Freddie thinks maybe it's, uh, her destiny. Destiny? Yeah, she left for France when she was a baby. And now that she's an adult, she's coming back to defend South Korea against North Korea. Hm... From what he says, it's Yeon-hee's destiny to help South Korea against North Korea. Really? My father wants to play some music he wrote for me. He recently started to play the piano. He composes during his free time. What a coincidence. Yeah, weird. Not bad for someone self-taught. What? I'm happy that me and him, we can exchange normal text messages now. He is happy too. Is his health okay? Does he still drink a lot? No, uh, he drinks less. Where did he go? He looking for a taxi. It's here, let's go. Come on, the taxi's here! I'm sorry for this. Nice to meet you. I don't understand. Uh, taxi. Bye. Bye. Hyehwa Station! Bye. Bye. Was that normal? To the guesthouse? It's striking how much you resemble your father. Take us to the Itaewon area. So you're partying tonight? Yes. We're not going to the guesthouse? No, I changed my mind. I could wipe you from my life with a snap of my fingers. What? I could wipe you from my life... with a snap of my fingers. Hello? This is Frédérique Benoît. You just sent me a message. Yes, still in Seoul. Yes, I can come. No, I can come today. JEONJU Is this where I was abandoned? No, the old Jeonju Hammond was in another neighbourhood. The building was destroyed and Hammond moved here in the 2000s. You're very young. This is your original adoption file. You received a copy in Seoul. Are we sure she will come? We can never be certain, but the tone of your mother on the phone suggests she will come. You came early. Yes, that's true. Yes? I've brought you some hot tea. Thank you. I'll now explain what will follow. When your mother arrives, she will be settled in the room next door. It's more or less the same layout and size as this one. Then someone will tell us that she has arrived. I will go to speak to your mother separately to prepare her for the meeting. Like we are doing now. When your mother is ready, I will bring her here. Do you accept that I be present during the meeting? Yes, all right. Yes? The mother has arrived. -Wait. Wait. -Yes? There's something I don't understand. Tell me. I thought that once parents had refused to see their child... Hammond could send no more telegrams. Yes, that's the law. But then... why did you accept my request for my mother? Perhaps we have employees who understand the feelings of an adopted child. Is that all? Freddie, your mother has arrived. This is your daughter, Freddie. Can I touch her? Yes. ONE YEAR LATER Hello. Hello, madam. Do you have a room available? Sure. For how many nights? Just one night. Wait a second. Single or double room? Single room, please. -Your passport, please? -Yeah. Happy birthday. Thank you. I need you to wait a bit for us to prepare your room. Okay. -Can I use the bathroom? -Sure. You take the stairs here on the first floor. MOM, SORRY I DIDN'T WRITE. I THINK I'M HAPPY. I HOPE YOU ARE TOO. YEON-HEE NEW MESSAGE NO SUBJECT RECEPTION ADDRESS NOT FOUND RETURN TO SEOUL Translated by: Banadera Angelica L
