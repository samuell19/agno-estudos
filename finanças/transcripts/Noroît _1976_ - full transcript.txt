A small isle in the Atlantic, apart from another larger - Shane... my brother... I searched for you... I found you... in the sea... among the rocks... torn... tattered... with my breath... with my hands... I held you... your body... like before. And you, you're resting! Peacefully dreaming... unaware of me. You thought we were destroyed when you'd finished. You weren't expecting me. I'm the last one. Our blood will triumph. It flows until you are avenged! I?m tired. I can do no more... Thirteen are still alive. Thirteen! We only have four hands! It's impossible. We can't do it. Think of our dead... our sisters. Yes. Afterwards... all will be finished for us too. Has Giulia returned? All are waiting for her. - Does she suspect you? - No. For her, I?m Erika. She calls me her confidant. Good. Then the time has come. I will return. I will do what we've decided. Go, Erika... Don't say my name. Now my name is Morag. Go tell Arno and her gang! I still hear nothing. Try again. Quick, she's arrived! My doves! Elisa, welcome your aunt. Stop your fussing. As if I were Mother Oberin... Regina, you're no longer in the convent. Oh yeah? That's news to me. Here are the gifts. It?s nice. Look! The first of my promises. Not funny! You've gone mad! How dare you... I?m in charge here! And I'll give a pistol to whomever I please. Come here, my child. Look at her! She's afraid. It?s annoying... You deserve to be slapped for such stupidity. - Go ahead, it won't be the first time. - Or the last, I?m sure! Look, there are more pressing matters: I want to jump, run, act. You know that when she's ready... there are big things waiting for her. - What did you bring me? - Elisa! You must be exhausted. Take it, my child... and practice. You won't be participating. A little brother is forcing us to slow down our plan of attack. Well, it will be at his own expense. What trouble, you poor thing... so much fuss to fill your pockets. And this, can you explain this to me? You're irresponsible... or Worse! No more plundering until further notice! Hand everything over to me! You win. - You always win. - You have nothing to complain about. What do you mean? - Nothing. - Nothing? Speak up! I see right through you, pal. I know very well what you want from Giulia. I wish you good luck, if you can make it. And you, don't you have any ambition? None! I've well off here. I?ve got everything I need... so long as you don't start stepping on my turf. Mine. They're perfect. You're well guarded with them, aren't you? Oh, they work well together. One turns pale while the other tans. They don't appear particularly loyal. I know someone you could use: a bodyguard. From the mainland. Someone truly formidable... who can do anything... if you're generous. - And what is the name of this marvel? - Morag, it's a woman. Elisa, do you see how I live... I have everything I want. Dresses, jewels, I was even given a slave. But it binds me, I?ve been castrated lf it seems like I?m sometimes hard on you, it's because I?m afraid for you. I?m afraid the same thing will happen to you. She's very nice to me, a lot nicer than you are. Beware of Giulia. Beware of her kindness! You're to be her heiress. Don't believe in her magic nor her secrets. I believe it. It amuses me. Watch out, Elisa. Even if she doesn't have it. I fear you too won't be able to escape. I don't want to work like this anymore. - We're slaves. - It?s becoming madder and madder. I?m afraid. Now, it's her or us. Arno, you owe me the right. Ludovico! Which hand? You always cheat. But l, on the other hand... keep my promises. Look... at what I?ve brought you. Thank you, my love! But what do you want this time? You want a little information? I can tell you one thing: it's not at the castle. Where is it? I have no idea. But I have all the time in the world. I?m the heiress. You're hungry. I haven't eaten in three days. But I?m not hungry. You owe me money. Fifteen gold pieces. I?m worth that much? Where have you come from? I was on the mainland for six weeks. - But they paid me for that. - To put down the revolt? - You live there too, right? - I?m on the other side. Ah, you've escaped from the women. Go watch the sword practice. - Anyway, I?m no longer there. - Why? Not enough money. The rebels cut off the roads. And then... I was asked to kill children. You don't like to kill? I kill... when I?m obliged to. And before? The same... For a long time, I suppose. Ten years. I won't ask about your origins. The rule here is silence. Have you brought anything with you? A horse? Nothing. I heard about you while on the boat. I came on foot. Erika knew your name. Thank you. Come! - Do you always work alone? - Yes... and no. I have my own method. Do you have good eyes? I see. And at night? I see. I will employ you. You will be my shadow. How horrible. I find arenas horrible. I was alone, locked up, I couldn't get out. It was cold, everywhere... The ramp was before me... slick... bright. I went forward, the soil was soft... slick. Slugs had gathered. I continued... to go up... The steps became more and more... difficult. I crawled forward, grasping anything I could hold on to. Finally, I arrived at the top. I fell to the ground... and I saw the red mark. Suddenly everything broke down, and the roar... the roar woke me. You were frightened by the sea's noise, Madame. You've been bleeding all night. It was really idiotic. I couldn't repel the knife stab. Suddenly I found myself all alone. It wasn't your fault. They were waiting for us. Someone betrayed us. Nonsense. I?m happy you weren't there. Shane. You're alive! Flesh and blood. Touch me if you don't believe it. All the rest is now a mirage. Tonight, at the keep. You asked me if I had good eyes. - Now I?ve seen what I needed to see. - In terms of what? The rifle shot during the expedition. Perhaps the enterprise failed... at the same time. To kill Jacob? Regina! Is that an order? Leave me now. I want to be alone. Jacob. His name isn't Jacob. Do you recognize this mask, Regina? Do you recognize it? It has poisoned you. In a few moments you will die. Listen! They're celebrating your death. Cry if you can! Why?... Why? You?ll never know. No. Not yet. There's still one little thing before you leave. She refuses! She refuses! Look! Morag... make her disappear. Listen to me! I know who you are! I was kidnapped by Giulia 3 years ago... as a gift for her sisters, and you've freed me. I want to help you. You never see anything. But you don't deceive me. Listen. Morag lied to us. She's not what she claimed. She's guilty. Of what, I don't know yet. It?s Erika who brought her here. They must be isolated. I need to know what's going on. Pay a visit to Erika this afternoon. What time is it? It doesn't matter. Everyone's asleep. The sun wore them out. It?s horrible. The body isn't there anymore. Who did it... this time? Morag. Arno waited down in the boat for her. A little plunge and that was it. Giulia is very well organized. Those cries. Like a pig being slaughtered. She's completely mad. We should all leave. At least those who can no longer bear it. - I cannot. - Why? Is it my turn now? Looking for me? It?s you who's looking! Yes, for Giulia's treasure. What do you know about it? Sailors in the ports... the gold and diamonds of all their plunderings. - It?s more than that! - More than that? The treasure is more than that. The treasure is more than that. I am here and there. And further still. And I have all the time I want. I am you and l. - Me? - Yes, myself times two. Where were you going? I want to leave. Why do you want to leave? But not now! Afterwards. Afterwards you can do want you want! You can even keep it! - I will spare it for you. - Don't touch me. We must act, fast! Next it will be you I?ll have to worry about. Celia... - She's your accomplice. - Not her. Yes, her. Precisely. Not her! - To the left or the right? - The left. You really must tell me. Why? My sweet, would you share it with me? Of course. - Is it fabulous? - Like me! Why not? It?s time it was brought to light. Listen to me well. - It?s in the Monkey Bay. - I knew it! Sixteen steps from the cave. - At ebb-tide? - Yes. You then advance obliquely north-northwest! I heard everything. It?s in the Monkey Bay! The time has come. - Heads must roll... and your empire? - Yes. It will vanish, breath by breath, into nothing. It must be celebrated. She must be there. Since I know now who she is. - Yes, more masks. - Exactly! A masquerade and fireworks. - You will invite her. - Me? Yes, me. Goodbye, Erika! Giulia has deceived you. - The gold's not there. - Then where is it? lf you find it... you?ll be at once here and elsewhere. Tell me, where's the hiding place? Closer to her. At the foot of the castle... in the Coat of Arms Bay. - You?ll see a stone. - And then? Search. The treasure is more than that. I am here and there. Two, three... and there. Still further. That's it! Ludovico! You wanted gold and diamonds. I give you... the sun. Giulia expects you tonight. I am ready. Don't go... not yet. I?m going. Alone. I?ll settle it without you. - Morag, I want to help you. - Leave. Go back to her! What is happening? The sun! Orbits... noon... Full moon! The court stands up! Why do you protect her? Only one lover hears her. A comet! See, this... frightening... marvel... this disheveled body... this ruffled star... distraught. Inconceivable... unspeakable... Tendernesses between... the cruel mother and her bastard child. My sons, forgive me... I will redeem myself. Mother sets afire her own daughter Dutch love, the most horrible of all. Listen! The thunder... barks with a powerful voice... You... It?s my turn, now? Leave... fast. Save yourself. Now you are the heiress. Here's the proof. Have courage, Morag. Tonight, I am double. You?ll die twice. I know.
