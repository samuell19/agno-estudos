Three years ago, I shot my first feature film, The Great Buddha+. It unexpectedly won some acclaim. My old classmates see me on the media sometimes and think that my life must also be "Plus" now. But actually, my life hasn't changed. I still ride my scooter to hang around town. If you ask me if anything's different, I think it would be my field of view. This time, the screen aspect ratio changed from 1:1.85 to 1:2.35. The image is also in color, and my voice becomes more charming. I think that counts as a plus. Let me explain something. That small scooter just now is mine. This big cool one is Chung's, my producer from Creamfilm. All his own movies have lost money. My movie was the first time he made a profit, and he then bought this heavy motorcycle. Although this bike isn't in my name, in my mind, I feel like I own a share of it. For the sake of this bike, I even got a heavy motorcycle license. Every time I want to go to Creamfilm Production to borrow this motorcycle, Chung always says he's about to use it. Recently, his studio called me and said that he's out of the country so I could ride it. As soon as I hung up, I rushed to the studio and took this motorcycle out for a ride. Since my last movie ended, I've been thinking about what to film next. When I consider Chung's Creamfilm Productions, a company that demands perfection without sparing sensibilities, I get a headache. When I was at my wits' end, my high school classmates came to mind. Hurry up. If you keep stalling, I'll leave. Tough hand. Are you giving up? -What's so funny? -He… Hands… Shitty… Shitty hands. If it's shitty, just get scooped. Damn. Tin Can. It's not just your shitty hands, I think you're in a shitty mood too. You won't kill yourself, right? Shut up. How much debt do you owe? Tell us. Show hand. -Scoop. -Scoop. Whatever. I'm the highest. When are you picking your wife up? The man is hustling, can't stop for the wife. Fuck. You're so fearless. If you don't… Don't pick up your wife, won't… Won't… Won't you get told off? When men are out earning money, women should stay quiet. Cut the bullshit. OLD QIONG'S BUBBLE TEA SHOP Look. Look. Your… -Your wife. -Your wife. Another two rounds and I'll leave. You're leaving before we beat the pants off Tin Can? A little further. Further. Okay, push slowly. Push slowly. Leading man, hit your mark. Focus. Director. It's time to yell, "Cut." Hold on. San-Lang, is the focus okay? No problem, Director. After Tom yelled "cut," he kept on sleeping. But A-Zhi sat up until dawn. Tom's movie dreams have become more frequent in the past few years, while A-Zhi's sleep quality has gotten worse. A-Zhi is like the wife of a typical Taiwanese film director, full of expectations for her husband mingled with sadness. A never-fulfilled movie dream can easily become a nightmare. Didn't I tell you I don't like pan-fried salmon? Someone like you who uses his brain should eat this kind of fish. It's full of omega-3. What were you filming last night? It sounded like a stressful shoot. Filming? Didn't we sleep last night? You yelled "action" while you slept. Very loudly. You scared me. Your expression looked like you were filming. No. It's probably just a rehearsal. You're racking your brain all day and all night. Won't you overwork it? I made you lunch, it's in the fridge. You can heat it up later. Don't smoke too much. Don't exhaust yourself. If you're stuck while thinking, go out for a walk. I'm going. Colleagues, thank you for your hard work. I'm treating everyone to drinks today. In the future, I hope to continue working with everyone. My promotion to section manager today is honestly a bit unexpected, even to me. But I will work even harder to lead everyone in making our department an exceptional company asset. Thank you, everyone. Thank you! Dian-Feng Chen, the manager wants to see you. Okay. Fan Man. I tried to support you for the section manager promotion, but it didn't work out. Keep trying. There will be future opportunities. According to Human Resources' data, your overtime for the past two months has been rather low. Sir, I only leave when my work is done. Fan Man. We're old classmates. That's why I'm advising you. This kind of thing is what the company wants to see, not how efficient you are. Also, the economy isn't good right now and you know the company hasn't made much profit in the past few years. You'll just need to endure your salary adjustment. Let's do our best together. The company won't do you wrong. Okay? Move that screen for me. Sir. Sir. The patient is unconscious and not responding. Checking the pulse. Did he slit his wrists or eat rat poison? No, he tried to commit suicide by eating these. What drug is this? Weight loss pills. UNSTOPPABLE SLIMMING Fuck. Was he killing himself or dieting? How the hell would I know? He just downed the whole bottle and started frothing at the mouth. Everyone in the sauna freaked out. Blowing bubbles like a crab. Two years ago, Tin Can somehow managed to find a girlfriend. Later, we discovered they met at a diner. -Careful. -That was also when Tin Can started borrowing money and maxing out credit cards. In the end, he even called up loan sharks. Fuck. We shouldn't have joked last time about killing himself. Don't think too hard. It wasn't like that. Hey, both of you. Your friend should be fine, right? I guess so. -Yes. -Perfect. Here, if you could please pay your friend's bill. Two set meals for 7,200 dollars. What did he eat? "Set meal" means he called for a girl. Why are there two then? He did it twice. Damn. Even before he dies, he's fucking around. Do you have that much? I'll call Blockage. Hold on, excuse me. Excuse me, hold on. Blockage. Where are you? I… I'm outside. I… I'll call you later. Are you okay? Well… Okay. Let's continue. You said that you built houses? I… I do. If you can, you should build your own house. Here. This album is a list of women looking for remarriage. Look. At your age, a remarrying partner is best. They have more experience and a stronger sense of family responsibility. You can support each other. Once you become our member, you'll be able to see all of our data. We have a lifetime membership. If you divorce and come back, that's no issue. DATING AGENCY Miss Weng has a misunderstanding about Blockage. He doesn't build houses. He makes paper model houses. Blockage came to a dating agency because his grandma's health is poor and bedridden. A neighbor recommended that he get married to wash away the misfortune. Blockage was raised as a kid by his grandma. The two of them live above a paper model shop. Blockage clearly knows that the paper shop can't even support the two of them. How could he marry someone and have a child? SONGMEI PAPER MODEL SHOP SONGMEI PAPER MODEL SHOP Granny. Is it time? Time only exists in this dimension. Everything, in the beginning, was simple in principle and evolved in complexity. All things from nonbeing to being, from whence they came, so they shall return. In modern society, men work all day to make a living and don't have the energy at night. At times like this, you can rely on the Immortal Tiger Dragon Pills Pills Pills Pills Pills. Cut! Mr. Immortal, you can say the last line normally. We'll edit in the echo later. That way, it'll sound better. Really? Is that right? Yes, you can take a break. Tin Can. When Mr. Immortal comes out, don't look at the camera. Look at Mr. Immortal. Tom. It's cold. Tin Can. It's tough to find work nowadays. It wasn't easy to recommend you to this client. Just suck it up. Also, when you're here, you need to call me "Director." Director. Tom. Do you want to keep this angle or change the shots? Wait a moment. Okay. Tin Can. Looking at the camera or Mr. Immortal means different things in the language of film. If you look at the camera, it means something is going to happen. If this was a European movie, the camera would slowly zoom into your face. If this was an American movie, it would zoom into my eyes and make a transition to another scene. I think you need another shot or a close-up where I look at the camera. That's more persuasive for the audience. Also, Tom, is this scene in the morning or at night? The sex scene is obviously at night. Is something wrong? It's so bright. Did you narrow the aperture? What do you mean? You're a filmmaker, but you don't know how to shoot "day for night"? What's "day for night"? In old American Western films like John Ford's Stagecoach and Howard Hawks' Red River, they shot night scenes in the middle of nowhere. They couldn't set up the lighting. So they shot during the daytime with a narrow aperture. Keep it narrow. It'll look like nighttime. That's what "day for night" is. Did you get it? A-Chang. Let's narrow the aperture to make it look like "day for night." Tom, are you sure? This is a pill commercial. Will your client be able to process it? Let me tell you. Every parking space here costs a million. Mine only cost 480,000 and it's the same square foot and the same bank loan. Isn't this space for motorcycles? This space is for cars. And look, there's another benefit. When people open their doors, they won't hit my car. I even get exercise by pushing it every day and saving money. I think other people are more afraid of your car door hitting them. Fuck. Come see my house. Motherfucker. How could I forget my bag? Fuck. -Do you need help pulling it? -No. I pull it every day. I want to replace this tile. Why replace it? It's not stuck on properly and it's hollow underneath. You're such an expert. People like us are lucky to be able to buy one house in our lives. We need to be experts. How much was it? It costs 7.2 million with a 2-million-down payment. How did you get so much money? I saved it. I only saved 300,000 though. The rest was an inheritance from my dad. Why do you smoke so much? It's a new house. I'm celebrating. But you smoked two in a row. I'm going to take a nap so I'm smoking one ahead of time. Ahead of time? So I won't wake up mid-nap to smoke and hurt my sleep quality. Mom, you're rubbing mud on it again? Yes. Rubbing mud lets the city folk know it's fresh. Is my necktie straight? Yes, it's very straight. -You're changing jobs today? -Yes. Tom recommended it. A household registration office job. Isn't he unemployed? Why doesn't he get a job for himself? He wants to be a director. He's too busy writing screenplays to work. Being a director means being unemployed. He only shoots 1 film every 300 years. There are three main points to residency checks. Firstly, the residence must be indoors. Indoors means four walls with a roof and a door. Secondly, they must sleep on a bed with a pillow and a blanket. These three things are a must. Thirdly, they must have a place to bathe. By the way, remember to take photos. You don't need to wear a tie when you come to work. We want to be approachable. In this department, only the boss wears a tie. Okay? TRAIN CROSSING AHEAD VIDEO SURVEILLANCE IN OPERATION Is this No. 411? Yes. Sir, I'm from Household Registration. -Did you apply for a residence transfer? -Yes. Please have a seat. No, thank you. Your house… Why are there no walls? Walls? Who says walls need to be made of cement and brick? Do you sleep here? Yes, this is my bed. I sleep here. Where do you bathe? There. Do you see that bucket? Young man. Let me tell you. Men shouldn't bathe regularly. Otherwise, they'll lose their qi. I see. -I'll take pictures of you, okay? -Okay. Registration checks today are very different from the past. In the past, for public order and political reasons, the police performed the checks. However, right now, the registration staff only visits you in person if you have any requests or in special circumstances. What requests do citizens have? Usually, it's to attend a school district or apply for social welfare. Of course, sometimes there are property disputes that require residence transfers. Is anyone home? Is anyone home? Is Jing-Long Chen here? I'm from the Household Registration Office. Are you Jing-Long Chen? Did you apply for a residence transfer? Can I take a photo of you? Dear viewers, according to our film crew's investigation, this man is Jing-Long Chen. He used to be talkative. But after the property dispute, he wrote everything he wanted to say on the walls. From then on, he never said a word. Young man. Young man. Young man. Stop sleeping. I was afraid that you couldn't finish so I woke you up. It's a Mercedes-Benz. Young man. Can you change this to a convertible? Sir, you're very stylish, but I don't know what the traffic's like over there. If you remove this part, driving will be more dangerous. You're right. Safety first. Perhaps I can add a spoiler. A spoiler here? That would look stylish. I'll give you a chauffeur to drive your car too. Good. That's good. Young man, why are you frowning? I saw Golden Boy and Jade Girl recently. Is that so? Did you see Old Li as well? Old Li? Yes, he wears all-black and a hat. He looks very serious and pretentious. I did. He even said some confusing bullshit that I couldn't understand. He's actually a good guy. He just likes to act that way. But people who see him will be taken away in one to two months. If so, do I need to prepare anything for my grandma? Don't think too hard. Any cigarette you light will burn to ash in the end. People are the same. Blockage got his nickname because he stutters when he talks to us. But it's strange. He never has that difficulty when he talks to spirits. It's probably related to his unique body constitution. But it also causes him trouble in his work because his clients often come to see him directly, asking him to fix things. Blockage doesn't mind helping them. He says that it's their last wish, so helping is the right thing to do. Next up, I will actively promote the PLUS Project 2.0. This project not only integrates industry, government, and academics but more importantly, it will attract talent from Silicon Valley, letting us surpass Taipei in three years' time. In five years, we'll catch up to Tokyo. In ten years, we'll be on par with New York. Cut! Mark. Scene one, take one. Hey. How's that? Mayor, you're so professional. You're so charming for the camera. I only described the things my city government usually does. It's nothing special. Would you like to see your gallant figure? It's really impressive. -I can see it now? -Yes. -Please. -Okay. San-Lang, is the focus okay? Play it back for the mayor. Mayor, if anything needs improvement, let us know, all right? Director Wu, you're a professional. What could I say? However, I have one suggestion. Do consider whether making my face slightly bigger conveys my determination, a feeling of determination. -Mayor, you're really so professional. -Really? We'll give you a close-up shot, okay? -Right now? -Yes. Give the mayor a close-up. -Mayor, take your time. -Okay. What are all of you doing? Mayor. Congressman. -Congressman, why… -Mayor. Why are you here? What happened? Should we talk later? We're busy right now. The party wants me to withdraw from the election because of my scandal. You've got so many scandals, I don't know which one you mean. Mayor. Congressman Gao is referring to the Mount Foshan Buddha Park scandal. I thought I was asked to withdraw because my office was shot six times. The party handled the issue via procurement suspension. All right, never mind. What will we do now? If we don't get a new candidate, what will I tell my supporters? Can we talk later? I'm busy now. All right? Is that okay? Let's go to the bathroom. I'm in no hurry. You can go first. I'm shooting a commercial here. Mayor. You can shoot puff piece commercials whenever you want. What's the hurry? If you don't finish today, shoot it another day. Pack it up. -Pack it up. -Okay. Fine. Let's go talk. -I'm sorry. -Congressman Gao loves making deals in the bathroom. One, there are no security cameras. Two, the bathroom is Congressman Gao's lucky spot. Pack it up. After all, every great figure has their own lucky spot. Our first president, Chiang Kai-Shek's lucky spot was the riverbank. He would stand and watch fish swim against the current, inspiring him to become humanity's savior. A great man of our era, a beacon of freedom, and the bulwark of our people. Everyone wants my position. Can I refuse to drop out? Old Gao. You know you're a bad candidate. The party has to consider the big picture. This could impact the presidential election. What do you think then? Let's find a greenhorn with a good image, no party affiliation, and no political baggage. You can still pull the strings. That way, you can satisfy your sponsors and I can keep those who want to run quietly. Tom is somewhat well-connected locally. He sometimes takes cases for extra money. But most of the time, it's some strange products or drugs of unknown origin. Shooting the mayor's commercial today pays better than usual. But Congressman Gao's interruption meant that he would be lucky to make a break, even at this time. Hello? Anything? Okay. Director Wu. This way, please. Director Wu, please have a seat. Director Wu. -Hello. -Hello. I'm Wei-Qing Gao. -Congressman Gao, pleased to meet you. -Sit. Director Wu, our party has always lacked people with art and cultural backgrounds like you. We want you to run for congressman. I will hand my district over to you. This… I should discuss this with my wife first. My life's goal has been to make movies. To let Taiwan's cinema be seen by the world. Mayor. You have such talent here. Why didn't you introduce me sooner? You're too polite. Congressman Gao, -there should be no issues. -Okay. Let's do it. Director Wu, I'm Congressman Gao's special assistant. Pleased to work with you. Thank you. Another zero… -Another zero… -I lost. Another zero… -Another… Fuck. -Fuck. Is this a scam? Let's chip in again. Hurry. Blockage, you've got the lucky touch. Go buy it. Money… Here. Tin Can, where's the money? I don't have any money. You ran out of them in two weeks? It's true. -See for yourself. -Let me see. Fuck, what's this? A lucky bill. People say a US dollar in your wallet brings wealth. It must not be working. The bill looks fucking old. Temple of Wealth, Master Hsu, and Hall of Fox Fairies. What the hell? The wallet has more charms than bills. Give it back. Look at this receipt. It's one digit off of the ten-million-dollar prize. But due to the last digit, I couldn't even win the smallest 200-dollar prize. What's the missing number? If the last digit was "four," I would've won. I kept this receipt with me to remind myself. My life was this close. You're this close. I'm this close. We are all this close. I don't know how close you are. But I want to make an announcement. I'm running for congressman. Fuck, that's bullshit. You can't even make it as Village Head. Congress… Congress… Congress… Congressman Wu. Nice. Perfect. Turn sideways. A little more. Great. Excellent. A little more sideways. A little more. -Hang on, photographer. -Great. Let me help him with the clothes. The shampoo I used was pretty good. It's dandruff-free and plant-based organic. I'll give it to you next time. What's taking so long? It's done. Here. Take a look. It's good. Let's get a full-body shot. Congressman Gao. I don't think "All ears" is the best slogan. What do you mean? It's easy to be all ears. I think we should point to tomorrow. Ming-Tian, let's go to the bathroom. I just went. Come on. Taking a piss will clear your head. It's good to be young. One could piss ten feet upwind. But at my age now, even downwind, I dribble on my shoes. Sir, aren't you taking a piss? I just did. How's it going? It's pretty good. Everyone is so professional. Of course. Making movies is not my thing, but I'm a veteran at elections. Just do as I say. Of course. Of course, I'll do as you say. I only had a little thought. I want it to match my name. "Point to Tomorrow." "Let people see Tom-orrow." The idea is not bad. But listen. You're a novice. What matters most for a novice? -Being all ears. -Okay. -Who is it? -Household Registration Office. You are… I'm from Household Registration. Did you apply for a residence transfer? Yes, I did. This way, please. Do have a seat. It's okay. Okay. Are you Ms. Mu-Hsuan Lin? I am. Can I see your ID? Sure. Tin Can is looking at this woman with a different gaze because she is the school beauty that he long yearned for. Although he hasn't seen her in over 20 years, Tin Can would have recognized her even if she was burned to ashes. Why did you move here? For work. What do you do? I'm a masseuse. Like meridian therapy. What's in that room? It's my studio. Can I see it? There's no need to. It's nothing, just a studio. How long have you been here? I moved in last month. Can I take a photo of you? A photo? It's the protocol. I'm sorry. Okay. Then I… Stand back a bit. Okay. Hi… Hi. Young lady, you snuck up here. Mr. Li, I'm sorry. This is Ms. Wang, the one who is meeting you today. She is her daughter. She's concerned about her mom's date so she came up first. We live in a dangerous world. A-Qiao, don't talk like that. It's okay. My clients are all upstanding figures. Don't worry. Ms. Wang, have a seat. Thank you. Please take your time. -I'll be downstairs. -Okay. This is my mom, A-Yue. What's your name? I'm… Block… Block… Blockage. I can tell. But what's your name? He says he's called Blockage. It's his nickname. Why do you want to meet my mom? Miss Weng… Miss Weng introduced us. He didn't ask for me in particular. Why are you still single at this age? That's weird. I… take care of… -Granny. -Your job is taking care of your grandma? -No, I… -He means that he's busy working and taking care of his grandma so he's not married. Mom. You're being strange. How could you understand him? Do you two know each other? -No. -No, we don't. I don't know how I can understand him either. In high school, the school beauty was in a different class. But Tin Can always found a way to get close to her. The school beauty was number 31 in Class 11, while Tin Can was number 7 in Class 12. Every day from 11:31 a.m. to 12:07 p.m. was the period of time that God gave for this Cowherd and Weaver Girl to meet. At 11:49 a.m., the meeting reached its climax. Please come in. I happened to be checking registrations nearby and thought I'd drop in. Hope you don't mind my unannounced visit. It's fine. By the way… Could you please fill these out? -All of them? -Yes. Okay. Ms. Lin. You moved from Taipei, but I saw in the system records that you were originally from here, right? Mr. Lin. Are you here today to have me fill out the forms or to investigate my personal life? Don't get me wrong. The records are all in the system. Since the election is coming, we have to double-check for ghost voters. Done. Thank you. My hand is warm, isn't it? Am I a ghost? No. Add me on LINE. That way, you don't need to keep checking my residency status. Okay. It has already been a week since the fire. Come and see. It's already rusted. The police were still investigating so we weren't allowed in. Come and see. It's still burning. We can't live with this smoke. When will insurance pay us? The loss adjuster will send us the claim. We'll then evaluate the claim. How long will it take? Two weeks at the earliest. What? Two weeks! Let me tell you. I've lost ten million in damages and that doesn't include the factory. Come and see this here. I worked hard for all this. I've got a wife and children. Your asshole insurance company is dragging your feet with my claim. Fuck. Two weeks. Relax, Mr. Chiang. We won't let you down. How much sorrow can you hold? Enough to fill a tin can with meat. Such bullshit. Where's Tom? He said he's busy with the election. HITTING STRONG, MING-TIAN WU Who's that? Looks familiar. It's Tom. Fuck. Looks like an idiot. You had something to tell us? Remember the little princess in Class 11? Our school beauty? Mi… Minus. A foreign-sounding name. She changed her name to Mu-Hsuan Lin. Lin… How… How… How do you know? I was checking household records. It's the school… It's the school beauty. This place looks like a shady business. Where did you meet her? The Spades Building. Spades… All… People… who are… hookers… Hookers… -Stop it. -No… -Enough. -You… After… graduation… didn't… -she-- -Didn't she go to the States? I checked. She didn't go. This showroom was specially designed by the construction company to showcase green buildings. Congressman Gao chased down sponsors and turned this housing sales office into a grand headquarters. Tom set up a desk in the old showroom to make it his office. The headquarters thinks Tom is holed up here, devising campaign strategy. But he told me that he was actually devising his movie script. However, I discovered that most of the time, he's gazing at the toilet on the wall. Ming-Tian. How's the script? I've got some new ideas. I'm putting them together. I made this coffee this morning. I was too busy to give it to you. Not sure if it still tastes good. Thank you. Someone once said, "The life of a brewed coffee lasts only ten minutes." How does it still smell so good even after a long day? These are Galápagos Island beans. Their production is small. The flavor is rounded and mellow. It's especially sweet when it travels down your throat. The aroma rushes to my head. I used the Kono style hand drip method. The brewing takes a long time, but it fully extracts the layers of flavor. No wonder it's so good. If you like it, I'll brew it for you every day. Is that okay? As long as you like it, it's okay. Ming-Tian. Do you want to have sex with me? I do now. A Psalm of David. "To the choirmaster. Oh Lord. Thou hast searched me and known me. Thou knowest when I sit down and when I rise up. Thou discernest my thoughts from afar. Thou searchest out my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways." With this Psalm, God makes us reflect on our life in four ways. God is omniscient. -God is omnipresent… -Dear viewers, you may find the actor of this Father familiar. He played not only this Father, but also the sauna manager, and Old Li, who appeared with the Golden Boy and the Jade Girl. He's a messenger from God, a hardworking common man, and an angel of death who guides the dead to Western Paradise. Now that we can buy 3-in-1 instant coffee, we can also have 3-in-1 actors. …when our prayers aren't answered, it invites us to self-reflect. Father. Dian-Feng, I haven't seen you doing a mass offering for a long time. GOD'S COMPASSIONATE HEART THIS DOOR GUIDES US IN How are you? Since my dad passed away, I've had doubts about life. Don't run from them. Come to church more often. Okay. I can see from your frown that something is wrong. Father, I'm having a child. That's wonderful! It's a gift from God. But I'm not married. You didn't use birth control? Have I sinned? Dian-Feng, do not try to self-interpret scripture. If scripture cannot help people, what meaning does it hold? I don't feel confident about my future. Your future is not in your hands. What you can decide is to get married, welcome the child, raise the child, and walk God's path together. Goldfinger. Mr. Kato? Yes, Mr. Lin. Why are you here? I came to see you. I… I… I… You can just speak Chinese. There will be subtitles below. Okay, understood. Mr. Kato, I really admire you. I've seen all your films. I know. I've seen you on the other side of the screen too. Did I have my clothes on? I didn't either. Mr. Lin, there's something on your mind. Mr. Kato. How did you know? If not, that bear wouldn't be like that. I've had a crush on a girl for nearly 30 years. I met her recently. Is she married? Does she have a boyfriend? You don't have to worry then. Go get her. But she is a hooker. Mr. Lin. How could that be a problem? Do you know how many AV actresses I've had sex with? We are ordinary people. We fell in love. We get our hearts broken. Our job and your goddess's job is to bring happiness to this world. If you truly love your goddess, you should bring her happiness too. I will now pass my wisdom and mastery all to you. You are my only apprentice in Taiwan. Come, give me your hand. Hold my fingers. Open your hand. Look. You got this. Thank you. What… What I… What I do… You… We're okay with what you do. It's a good thing. Why wouldn't it be okay? You… Your… husband… He… My husband passed away when A-Qiao was little. He was a construction worker. In order to afford a house, he worked too hard. One day, he was too exhausted. He fell from a high place and died. Mom was taking care of me and didn't have time for a boyfriend. Who would want a poor woman with a child? I… I… I make… paper… Also… no… Blockage thinks women are also afraid of his paper models. Besides, he's poor so he never got a girlfriend. People… People… whole… Whole life… afford… Afford… Many people spend their whole life working and still can't afford a house. I make… paper houses… for… the dead… Blockage makes paper houses for the dead to help them achieve what they couldn't in life. After they die, their souls can rest in peace. When they leave, they'll have no regrets. Blockage. Do you like my mom? I… I… I am… serious… Seriously will… Mom, what is he saying? I… I don't know what he's saying. But you know everything he says. I… will… Will… Why are you stuttering too? He says that -he is serious-- -Don't. He is serious about us. After several dates, A-Yue started helping at the paper shop. Although they're not married yet, A-Yue already made it her home. Not only did she clean the house, but she also became the shop receptionist. Blockage, you're going to Director Guo's funeral home at 4:30 p.m. She became in charge of all outside liaisons. A-Yue is a simple woman. Because of her simplicity, she understands everything Blockage says. The milkfish soup is ready. I'll bring it to Granny. RECEPTION CENTER A-Ya, can you edit my fingers to be longer? Yes. That's good. Too long isn't natural either. Pointing like this and the slogan says, "Tomorrow will be better." Congressman. This is the mock-up. We want to show you and get your approval. You came up with this? We designed it together. So you gave up on "All ears." "Tomorrow will be better." And I'm worse then? Congressman. Let's go to the bathroom. Why? Does my face make you want to take a piss? Congressman. Let's go. My brother Gao. I often ask myself why I received the honor of your help. Then just shut your mouth and be all ears. I know I am just a puppet. But let me tell you, I have my own thoughts too. Now that the ballot number has been drawn, it's too late to make a substitution. I can just throw the election. I've got nothing to lose. But it's a different story for you. Do you think I'll let you go? No. But there are more people who won't let you go. Your sponsors, your patrons who handle problems, and your financing organizations. You've gone too far. I'm not done yet. Now it's you who needs me, not I who need you. Make tomorrow better then. But I'm telling you, stay away from Val é rie. PROMOTE FOLKLORE CULTURAL HERITAGE There's the bride! We're here. -So beautiful! -My goodness! -You're so beautiful! -Gosh! -You look so happy. -Congratulations. -You're so noisy, he is sleeping. -Be good. I love you. Wait, let's take a group picture. Three, two, one. -You're so happy. -Indeed. I can't believe you're the first to marry. -What? -You sound a little jealous. Of course. Look at me, do I have a choice? -Where did you get knocked up? -Your bump looks so big now. -Tell us. -How? At a comic book store. -You're crazy. -Right! You're crazy. The cubicles are so small… -How did you do it? -He covered her mouth. You know… Covered my mouth? How did you know? I want to tell you Fan Man's story. When Fan Man worked in Taipei, he rarely slept and dreamt a lot. After he returned to southern Taiwan, the problem stayed. When he couldn't sleep, he would go to the 24-hour comic book store. That's how he met A-Zen who also couldn't sleep. A-Zen's job was in Taipei with business trips to southern Taiwan. When she couldn't sleep, she would go to comic book stores. A-Zen loves comic books. She would read until she collapsed, squeaking, and giggling. That was how Fan Man noticed A-Zen. It was because of her laughter. At first, the two sat back to back. Then, they sat face to face. Later, they simply sat together for warmth. In the end, they entered the bridal chamber, which was a comic book cubicle. Let's congratulate them. Congratulations! With his incredible talent and her well-known virtue, they are a peerless couple. The groom is handsome and smart. The bride is lovely and sweet. After the consummation tonight, they will welcome an offspring next year. We have a lot of VIPs today. Congressman Gao is also here with us. Let's welcome him to the stage for a few words. Let's give a round of applause to Congressman Gao. Congratulations! Ladies and gentlemen, I am Congressman Gao who values justice and our community. We are here today to bless these newlyweds. To a long life together and may they soon have a son to vitalize our nation. Let's raise our glasses. Here. MING-TIAN WU Let's drink. Cheers! Cheers! This election has become very competitive. Because I have other personal plans, our party has nominated a newcomer, Ming-Tian Wu, to continue serving you. Please support. -I urge you to support Ming-Tian Wu -Please support. as you have supported me, okay? -Okay! -Cherish Congressman Gao. -Support Ming-Tian Wu. -Support Ming-Tian Wu. -Cherish Congressman Gao. -Cherish Congressman Gao. -Support Ming-Tian Wu. -Support Ming-Tian Wu. Although Tom is a young man, as a film director, he could have pursued his career in Taipei. Yet he chose to stay and contribute to his hometown. Thank you, everyone. My fellow villagers, I'll be all ears for your opinions and build for everyone a city for arts and a cultural metropolis. Please support me! Give me a chance to serve you. Please support me. Please support me. -Victory! -Victory! Let Ming-Tian Wu lead us to a better tomorrow. Let's make tomorrow better. "Tom-orrow" will be better! -Tomorrow will be better. -Tomorrow will be better. -Tomorrow will be better. -Thank you! Everyone who is here today, please get ten of your friends to vote. Send Ming-Tian Wu to Congress, okay? -Thank you! -Okay! Thank you! Cherish Congressman Gao. Support Ming-Tian Wu. Cherish Congressman Gao. Support Ming-Tian Wu. Cherish Congressman Gao. Thank you, dear friends, for giving your blessings to the bride and groom today. Please excuse them so that they can change their outfit and they'll return to share a toast with us. Fan Man. Are you all right? Tom turned your wedding into his campaign rally. What bullshit. It doesn't matter. We're friends. So many people came so it'll help his campaign. What's wrong then? I don't know. I'm getting married today and a child is coming. Isn't it great? Fuck you. I have nothing. A-Zen is a good girl. I don't know why she likes me. I always thought I was a lonely guy. I would buy a small house with a parking space and live with my mom. That'd be enough. Can I make A-Zen happy? Two people will be happy if both of them put in efforts. I always thought life was simple. Study hard. Get a job. Marry someone you like. But now, fuck. I work hard on everything, but everything turns to shit. Fan Man. That is how life is. You worry too much. Your wife is ready. Get ready to toast. All of us know that Tom's breakfast is delicately plated. Most of the time, it's a salmon fillet with some tasty sides. But today, A-Zhi has prepared a special dish to terrify Tom. Why did you put your underwear on the plate? When's the last time you saw my underwear? You don't even know what it looks like. Would this fit me? Whose is this then? I'm asking you. I really don't know. Ming-Tian Wu. Why was this in your pocket? I don't know. Ming-Tian Wu, you son of a bitch. You son of a bitch! How long have I been with you? How much shit have we been through? I buy my underwear from street vendors! Cotton made! I can't even buy new ones when they loosen! You heartless damn asshole! I didn't dare have children… for your sake. I had two abortions without telling you. All for you and your endless movie dream! You shameless shit! Are you done? A-Zhi. I don't know whose underwear that is. Trust me. I'll find out who set me up. After the incident blew up, Tom ran out to find the person who set him up. But in fact, the underwear was a souvenir from when Tom had coffee with Val é rie in the office. Since then, Tom kept it in his pocket, slipping his hand in to play with it from time to time or taking it out to sniff when no one is around. I thought you were busy campaigning. How could I miss a friend's housewarming party? Where's the house? Here. This? No doubt. I have already asked. Let's go. From… -the back. -The back. Yes. Fuck. Blockage. Are you fucking crazy? Do you really want to move here? Yes. Does this dog bark? You idiot. Enter… -Sit. -Okay. Take… -Take off our shoes? -Yes. Idiot. Here. After you, Congressman. Take the drinks. This is yours. Blockage. How long did it take to build this? Almost… Almost… six months. It's cool in here. No need for air conditioning. Is there a spirit? Damn it. Stop that nonsense. Can I smoke? Yes. But… be… careful. All right. Get the playing cards. You made this too? I'm… not… that bored. I bought it. Blockage. Why are there pillows and blankets here? I… I… sometimes… take a nap… here. It really is a house warming party. The air stinks. Blockage, open a window. There's really a window? Fuck. There's a view too. It's… Mount… Mount… Mount Fuji. Fuck. Amazing. I have an idea. Tom, if you're stuck while writing scripts, just move in here. Script… Script… SCRIPT Did you make this, Blockage? This… This… This is… for you. Are there words in it? Bullshit. There'll be words if you burn it. Bullshit. What's that? The school beauty? You… You want… Want… school beauty… I'll… make one for you. Make one, your ass. Did you go there? No. If you don't go, I will. I… will… go too. I'll go and canvass her vote. Fuck. You would really dare to go? It's not whether we dare, but whether we would want to go. The school beauty is yours. Or… how about… you… You go… and… Seven… Seven thousand… two hundred dollars… Don't… -Don't… -Don't pay me back? Don't pay me back. 8,000 in total plus money for room and shower. Fine, get the cards. Seize the day. Be brave. -Again? -Fuck. You got lucky earlier. Fine, a second bet. -Scoop. -You too. -I… -You too. Wait. -Wait. -Fuck. The first time doesn't count. What the fuck? No gambling at a housewarming. What's wrong, Tom? Bumpy campaign? Or is your wife nagging you? No. It's nothing. Nothing? He is grumpy and still says it's nothing. Number 4. This is congressional candidate Ming-Tian Wu's campaign bus, asking for support from fellow citizens. Ladies and gentlemen. What you are hearing now is a voice-over I made for Tom's campaign. A few days after Blockage's housewarming party, Tom made me record it. Not only did he not pay for my transportation, but he even asked me to write the script myself. As we sat in the office with the toilet on the wall, he asked if I remembered the receipt that was off by the number "four," the receipt that almost won ten million. When the candidates drew ballot numbers, to his surprise, he drew "four." He said that after so long, God is finally telling him the meaning of the number "four." Granny. Why are you up? I feel better today. I wanted to make you some red bean soup. I need to make a delivery now. Don't wait up. Is A-Yue coming? She'll be here in a minute. Okay. -Granny, I'm leaving now. -Okay, take care. Thank you, please sit. Thank you. -Let's get a seat. -Make sure everyone gets one. -Thank you. -Please show your support. MING-TIAN WU -Have a seat. -Okay. -Have a seat. -Thank you. -Thank you -Have a seat. -Hello, ma'am. -Tom. -How are you? Thank you. -I'm fine. Look! You're just as handsome as in the photo! You look beautiful too. -Please show your support, okay? -I'll support you. Please welcome Congressman Gao! Ma'am, the Congressman is here. Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for your hard work. -Please show your support. -Thank you… -Please show your support. -Show your support. -Thank you. -Please show your support. Mrs. Wu. How may I help you? This is the Congressman's office. Hello. How should I address you? Just call me Val é rie. Val é rie. It's French. Valérie. It means "bravery." You must be fucking brave then. What do you mean? Mrs. Wu, why are you holding this? I washed it for you. Mrs. Wu, there must be a misunderstanding. Put it away. Don't put it in my Tom's pocket again. What do you mean? Brave Val é rie, some things can't be done with bravery alone. Are you insane? First, you bring me a thong and then make some hideous claims. It's you that's hideous. Your ass is too small for dicks. Watch your tongue. Ms. Val, I've been very polite to you. My Tom is going to be a film director. Let's be clear. For him, you are just a fling. Shit, we can't go to that noodle place again. Something is wrong with it. What? Do I smell? Not really. How's your stomach? Fine. It's better now. That's good. What's that? Let me dry my hands with it. It's nothing. -Let me dry my hands with it. -No. -Give me. -It's dirty. -Dirty. -I need to dry-- I'll give you a new tissue paper. A new tissue paper. The campaign headquarters was established today for Ming-Tian Wu, a congressional candidate for Taichung's Eastern District. Let the ceremony begin. The war drums sound out! NUMBER 4, MING-TIAN WU CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE FOR TAICHUNG'S EAST DISTRICT TOMORROW WILL BE BETTER! MING-TIAN WU TOMORROW WILL BE BETTER MING-TIAN WU LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE MING-TIAN WU Victory! Tomorrow will be better! Tom-orrow will be better! Number 4! Ming-Tian Wu! Tom! Go for it! Go, Tom! Ming-Tian Wu! -Victory! -Victory! Ming-Tian Wu! -Victory! -Victory! Ming-Tian Wu! -Victory! -Victory! Tomorrow will be better! -Tom-orrow will be better! -Tom-orrow will be better! -Tom-orrow will be better! -Tom-orrow will be better! Tom! Go, Tom! A-Zhi, go for it! Go! Ming-Tian Wu! -Victory! -Victory! Ming-Tian Wu! -Victory! -Victory! Ming-Tian Wu! -Victory! -Victory! Tom! -Go for it! -Go for it! Go! Taiwan, go! Taiwan, go! Taiwan… Tom! -To victory! -Victory! To victory! Victory! Blockage noticed his stutter was gone when his grandma got up to make red bean soup. On one hand, Blockage is glad that his stutter has improved. But on the other hand, he's worried that his grandma's sudden mental clarity is what people call "terminal lucidity." At this moment when he's unsure how to feel, in addition to delivering goods, he has decided to contribute his non-stuttering voice to his friend's campaign. Showing his full support. This is the compensation? Is this a joke? Only three million? I lost more than ten million in goods, not including the factory building. This is our loss adjuster's estimate. We didn't make up the numbers. Manager, are you mute? Say something. Where's your general manager? Sir, don't be mad. Let's talk it out. I did, but you didn't give a shit. That's why I brought them today. Do you know? Many families depend on my factory to live. Without enough compensation, we'll starve and die in the streets. -The factory hasn't operated for years. -What are you talking about? Don't piss him off. I'm sorry. He's not good at expressing himself. -He didn't mean it. -Make the insurance company pay. You're not the ones paying anyway. Don't be an ass. -It's not like that. -Then like what? -Like your ass? -Keep quiet. Will the company thank you for being loyal? -Will you get a bonus? -Sir. Let me tell you. Our insurance company has direct connections to the police. I've met many clients like you. Don't try to trick us. -It won't work. -Stop talking. Now what? Are you accusing me of a scam? -No-- -Fine. Fuck your aunt. You'd better watch your back. -No… -That's ridiculous. My aunt? -Enough. Wait in the office. -Fuck your mom. What the fuck? My mom too? Wait in the office. Go. Go. Don't be mad, sir. He says things without thinking. He's very blunt. Never mind. Let me handle it. Fan Man, sit. How old are you? Don't be so angry. They're the mafia. They came, all the way down here and you weren't helping. Do you know the difference between doing things right and doing the right things? No. Doing things right gets you promoted. Doing the right thing doesn't. You mean the difference between kissing ass and not kissing ass. Fan Man. Everyone knows you're capable. You always do the right thing, but that can make us look bad. Even the boss might think the company can't do without you. Nickel, I see what you mean. What did you call me? What's with the attitude? My classmate, do you know why you were called “Nickel” in high school? Because your name is Yi-Yuan Mei. You're "not worth a dime." I respected you as the manager so I have never told our co-workers that your nickname was "Nickel" and nobody knew we were classmates. I did all the work you asked for. Whenever I asked for a raise, you spoke of self-sacrifice while you swapped new cars. Did I say a fucking word? I asked Fan Man later, why he jumped, he languidly answered, "I wanted to jump." Scientists say the universe was born with the Big Bang that created time and space. But before the Big Bang, it may have all been chaos. I think life is the same. We spend a lot of time looking for answers to life. But perhaps the answer itself is chaos. SPRING Who is it? More forms to fill in? I'm here for you today. I thought of you the other day. What were you thinking about? I don't know. I just thought of you. I think you're quite different from other men I know. Different how? Well, it's… a feeling of familiarity. Like we've known each other for a long time. Wait here. I'll go get ready. Minus. That was my name a long time ago. I almost forgot about it. Who are you? I'm Guan-Tao Lin. I've liked you for a long time. Since when? Since the first time that I saw you. When was the first time? So your last visit wasn't about signing forms? I just wanted to see you. How about today? Are you here to see me or are you here as a customer? Wait here. I'll go get ready. For most men, when they were young, there was a goddess in their hearts. As they get older, the goddess slowly fades away. But for some, the longing never fades. In the end, they place her upon an altar to be worshipped occasionally when she comes to mind. For Tin Can, the school beauty is like a worshipped ancestor. She shouldn't have stepped down from the altar. After all, when a goddess descends, she shows her true colors. Without the distance, the beautiful illusion evaporates. Which gasoline, sir? The 92, full tank. Got him! None of your business. Fuck off! Fucking asshole. Get out! -Fuck! -Get him! Go! Fuck! -Fucking asshole! -Take this! -Fuck you! -Fucking asshole! Why are you beating me? When the police arrested the culprits, they discovered it was revenge on the wrong guy. Like most absurd news stories, Blockage left this world for no reason. He thought his grandma getting up to make red bean soup was terminal lucidity and he felt uneasy. But he realized now that his becoming unblocked was his own terminal lucidity. He started to worry about who would look after his grandma and whether she refrigerated the soup. Blockage always puts others first and rarely considers himself. I think he's like most Taiwanese. Straightforward and caring. But the heavens showed him no mercy. Through his eyes, he saw the other world and used his own hands to fulfill others' last wishes. But what about his own wishes? Passionate, spirited, and hardworking. Knowledgeable and trustworthy. Although he is new, Ming-Tian Wu will hear your heartfelt wishes and your needs. That's his mission. Citizens, let's gather our votes for Number 4, Ming-Tian Wu. Please support. Thank you. Number 4. This is congressional candidate Ming-Tian Wu's campaign bus. We ask the candidate, Ming-Tian Wu, to please take a bow. Step forward. Please burn the incense. Please bow to the deceased. Bow. Conclude. Family, please bow. -Let's thank congressional candidate, -Be strong. Mr. Ming-Tian Wu, for joining the memorial today. Thank you very much. NUMBER 4, MING-TIAN WU Please support. Please support Number 4. Thank you. Please show your support. -Please show your support. -Thank you. -Please show your support. -Thank you. Please support Number 4. Please show your support. Thank you. What's your hurry? Has it started? -I have other places to go to. -What other places? Are you here to shake hands or to pay respects? Do you think the damn election is better than us? I'm here to see my classmate, so what? See your classmate? Is this your classmate? See! -What are you doing? -See your classmate? Did you even ask when Blockage was hurt? -I was busy. -How busy? Do you think we're not busy? How busy can you be with that kind of job? You asshole, what did you say? What the hell? -What did you say? -Let go of me! What the hell do you want? -Say it again. -What? -Say it again. -What? What now? Calm down. You think you're better than us? See your classmate. Go and see then. -I'm already here, what-- -Go and see. Stop it. Why are you making such a scene? -Is that your problem or ours? -Stop it. Motherfucker! You think you're so great? -Motherfucker! -Stop it. Stop it. -Motherfucker! -Stop it. -Break it up! -This film might be the first in history where the director enters the frame to hit people. Shooting films is unbearable sometimes. You can't separate the movie from real life. You might say this film is absurd. But for many people, life itself is a bunch of bullshit. Clapperboard! CLASSMATES MINUS DEDICATED TO OUR CLASSMATE, JUN-JIE LAI Ladies and gentlemen, and most esteemed guests. Now, my humble self will sing a song to comfort everyone's sadness and clear out the woes from your body. From now on, our families will live happily ever after. Health and wealth for all. Dear viewers, what we now see is a typical Taiwanese real estate commercial. Such commercials profile the life of a high-flyer. It costs two million per three square meters. Living here means being successful. The house itself becomes a family heirloom. In a few centuries, it could be selected by UNESCO to be a World Heritage Site. When we're young, we often talk about the future. Someday, I'll have a glorious homecoming, an expensive car, marry a beautiful wife, and live in a mansion. We believe the wings on our backs will lift us into the sky if only we work hard. But in our '40s, we started to realize that actually, we are just chickens. Finally, if I may take a moment of your time, I'd like to introduce the singer at the end of this movie. Wearing sunglasses and playing the guitar, he is "Chairman" Ke, the lead singer of LTK Commune. Although we could not pay him a great deal, we sincerely invited him to contribute to our soundtrack. You may not be familiar with LTK or Ke, but their music has deeply influenced Taiwan. In particular, this track, “Cartoon Pistol.” For men like us who are caught in our '40s, it is the heartbeat we hear in the dead of night.
