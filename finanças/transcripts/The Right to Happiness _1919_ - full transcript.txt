THE RIGHT TO HAPPINESS ("Children of one father. Grand social life image.") In the dubble lead of the twin sisters Sonia and Vivian, America's most talented and celebrated actress: Miss Dorothy Pillips. Russia in 1898, the land of darkness and oppression. The jewish quarter... The house of Andrew Hardcastle, situated at the edge of the jewish quarter. Andrew Hardcastle, co-owner of the New York firm of Forrester and Hardcastle. Soon after Hardcastle's arrival in Russia his wife died and left the twins... ...the one, Sonia... ...and the other, Vivian. The children's nurse, Leah, was a second mother for the little twins. "I have to leave for a short business trip. Take good care of my children during my absence. And in that night a storm erupted... And again the scourge of intolerance and oppression hit the jewish quarter... "Your fate is mine...! I, I am a jewess too... but these poor little ones must be saved!" The all-revealing morning sun's rays light the smouldering ash of what Hardcastle called his home only the day before. Nineteen years later, in 1917. The world war had broken out... revolution was brewing in Russia. A popular assembly on the first of May... In this environment little Sonia grew up and with her fiery character it wasn't long before she too took an interest in all that was discussed. "Comrades, this day is ours! The day of the people!" Young Paul, whose mother had saved little Sonia and raised her, had grown up with her and felt a great love for her. He didn't like untamed violence; on the contrary, he was drawn to Tolstoy's doctrine of universal peace and love. Hardcastle, who thought that his daughter was dead, died, had returned to America with hate in his heart and become an enormous, fabulously rich, yet unrelenting force in a sound business world. Henry Forrester, Hardcastle's partner, stood for sound, progressive business politics with fair, democratic ideals. Hardcastle's daughter Vivian had grown up and had everything that her sister lacked. CHILDREN OF ONE FATHER. Part two. George Winthrop, a rich do-nothing. "I'll only listen to you if you serve our cause." "If our workers' wages can stay what they are now, then we can make a five-million war profit this year. It would be huge." "But we'll have to raise the wages. Just think how tremendously expensive all the necessities have become." "In spite of that, they can live just as well, if they economize a bit..." "How much?" "Five thousand dollar for the Red Cross." "Will you also be going to the front, George?" "Oh no, I couldn't bear the thought. I can't leave Vivian alone, can I?" The war was over. Sonia wanted to see the world, to great America, to acquaint herself with its conditions and try to realize her ideals. In front of the Passport Agency in the Russian capital. "Please, leave me alone, I quite know what I want." "Even if you go to the end of the world, I'll follow you and watch over you, always." "The workers' wages may have been raised, their living and other costs have also become more expensive." "There was a time when they were able to adjust to circumstances, why can't they anymore now?" In another part of town a certain Miss Hardy supported her high living standard by renting rooms. Tom Hardy, her son, foreman in one Forrester and Hardcastle's factories. William Stowell. "To the success of my daughter Vivian's latest plan, a home for sick and old lapdogs." "If George gets old, he may go there, too." Lily, one of millions who are have to regard a strange boarding-house as their hearth and home. "Half of what I have is for you... half of what you have is for me." The next day. "If you leave the wages of the workers as they are, there will be unrest." "They'll have to make the best of it or else..." "Why can't we discuss it now that circumstances have changed so much and business is going well? We do not need to reject their demands out of hand just like that?" "Beautiful flower... born in sunshine. If only the sun could penetrate the darkness of tenements then the world would be one flower garden." "There is no sun in Russia. But here, in this great country, the sun of freedom shines. Living conditions are made by the people themselves. People should be improved through love!" "People are the result of living conditions. To change people, we must change living conditions." A poor victim of the darkness... "If only the sun could come in." "The sun will come... when love comes into the hearts of people." CHILDREN OF ONE FATHER. Part three. "Boss, we'd like to have our old job back." "I am sorry... our factory is full up... I can't help you." "Why do you send them away like that? These people used to give their best for the business." "But with a little good will every busy factory can still use an extra hand these days." "You're an impractical idealist. Your plan would weaken the entire business!" "No question of weakening... They'll be grateful for the opportunity we'd offer... We didn't force them to leave... What they did was in the general interest..." "You're a big fool! Twenty years I ran this business the way I wanted to...and I'll do so still, ENTIRELY THE WAY I WANT TO...!" "From this moment on our partnership is dissolved." "Remember, Hardcastle, there is nothing to be gained by imposing your will... Think and consider. I have different views on that and will prove the veracity of them by practice..." During evenings, at Vivian's, he often thought with sadness of her twin sister who had disappeared so tragically. Henry Forrester set up his own factory on a cooperative basis. Sound cooperation and mutual respect. While in André Hardcastle's factory... "You cannnot achieve full results with underpaid and disaffected workers." "If you cannot stay in control of the situation then I'll appoint a foreman who can!" Lunch break. In Hardcastle's dissatisfied workers Sergius found a keen audience for Sonia's rebellious theories... But when Sonia wanted to force her ideals on Forrester's men... "We have everything we want here and are content... quit your argumentations...!" "Don't worry, my son... by God's love everything will turn out RIGHT!" Sergius, whose protestations of love were left unreturned by Sonia, had found an easier victim in the naïve Lily. "Look, I just bought this for you, as a pledge of our love!" "Why hold on so tightly to all those old, stiff customs...we're free as the birds in the sky!" CHILDREN OF ONE FATHER. Part four. "How foolish... Father treats his workers better than anybody else...!" "Go to the factory, Miss Hardcastle, and judge for yourself." "You never refused me anything, father, so you can't refuse me this." "Let us preach LOVE instead of rough violence and let us seal our love in marriage." After Lily had turned him down, Sergius wanted to try his luck once more with Sonia. "Look, I bought this just FOR YOU." "We're not in Russia, pal!" "Great, this will buy milk for a lot of poor babies." Vivian kept her word and visited the factory. "I'll come back. I want to see how these poor people are housed." The streetcar took them to another world, to the blue skies and flowering meadows of the suburbs. "So beautiful, so lovely, why, the whole world could be like this!" "But is there enough goodness in people for it?" "Oh, sure. It was there once... and it's there forever. GOODNESS CAN NEVER DIE!" "Well, is this another of those intruders that you bring here to preach against me? Get out or I'll throw you out!" "HELP is what they need, not pretty words and sermons." Hardcastle's men became increasingly discontented. "When the world is full of love and sunshine, I'll be yours." "Tomorrow they want to strike... now you can carry out your theories. Speak to them at their meeting tonight!" But Paul's words that afternoon had affected a change in Sonia. A fierce battle raged inside her heart. How to attain her ideals? Through violence or... through tenderness and mutual understanding? "The sun! The sun!!" This harsh, harrowing suffering, this blatant contrast between impassive death and carefree youth were too much for her. Her fiery temperament flared up again... "If you have read my report about conditions in your factory, you MUST understand and... ACT." "Your silly proposals would make me loose half my profits." "If Hardcastle won't listen we'll MAKE him listen!" "The men have stopped working and ask for a meeting. What do I tell them?" CHILDREN OF ONE FATHER. Part five. A storm of violence broke out at Hardcastle's sumptuous villa. Meanwhile, Vivian was... In vain Paul tried... "What have I done to you? What is it?!" And suddenly... "That is what accomplished with your violence. You've killed her, she who loved and supported you most!" "Get a doctor, quick!" "You did it to save me. Why?" "Death is not so bad. My Paul was right... only through love...and understanding... can we live... and help." "Sis... dear sis!" "In 1898, during the massacre in Petrograd!" "Sonia, my child!" "Men, with violence you won't accomplish anything. Let us know your wishes in a meeting." "Help them... understand them... love them... for my sake." "Her noble sacrifice made me understand! All your needs will be provided for!" "The company will be re-established on a new, cooperative basis." "The world is full of sunshine... and I... I... will... always... be with you... always." Happily she lived for others... and happily she died... A greater love no one knew. The sunny dawn of a new day with the promise of a radiant, wonderful future. "You were right after all, Forrester. It's love and understanding that solve our problems." "By contentment and harmonious cooperation, we have achieved much better results with our content and happy people than was ever possible to us before." "I knew that everything would end happy and well..." The end.
