GRAND PRIX WINNER, 22ND KARLOVY VARY INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL, 1980 THE FIANCÉE BASED ON THE HAUS DER SCHWEREN TORE TRILOGY BY EVA LIPPOLD When will you come back? When will you come back? My dearest one? Come, Lord Jesus, be our guest, and let these gifts to us be blest. Amen. Roses don't fall from the sky, Nor can the rain be wine. So you won't come back... you won't come back... my dearest one. 10 years. 10 years, Lindau. 10 years in prison. A long time. Enough time here with us. Even for criminals like you. Please note: the first 2 years will be in solitary confinement. Don't go to the doctor. He's killing us! Ten years? Yes, sir. Well then, we'll see. You report like this: Prisoner number 47, conspiracy to commit treason, 10-year sentence, 3 days served. Also note: Four big things: Work, books, letters, visitors. 2 years... What is it? Nothing. No one knows anything. No one. It's over. It's over. - And the money? - The money, yeah, the money... I can't take any more. They're everywhere. On the train too. I'm sure. No one's here. When we arrive, you go home. - Done. - I'll do everything else. Home. Sure, home. There was nothing there. No news either. I have a feeling something's wrong. We have to take Irene out. She's flipped her wig. She's totally unpredictable. Totally. - Let Hermann know. - Yeah, yeah. Please, today. It's extremely urgent. Yes, absolutely. Today. Do your hands often shake? Give this money to Irene at 11:00 sharp. She's expecting her courier. We've heard your complaints, Hella. But Irene's been vetted very thoroughly. No apparent changes or risks, and we're all nervous. That's 64,000 marks in cash and 30,000 in checks. Tell her someone slipped you the money. Not another syllable. Max will follow you to the train station on his bike. The money has to get out. Every hour counts. - Is everything clear, Hella? - Yeah. What will be, will be With Mother Bee With Mother Hun It's already become But then Old Dufford She sure suffered It's ok, Hermann. You're reading about astronomy? You've talked about it. I had to look it up. We can't all be geniuses. Well, well, a poem. Everything yields, turns real, Needs just abide and Grant your rare, happy year And fields amply provide. You've read that before. The Rilke too. - Yeah? - Yeah. That's how I'll do it. I'll put some fruit on top. Are you staying? Top quality. As a peddler, I know something about it. You're my husband. I'm your wife. Come what may. You're my wife. I'm your husband. You? Why you? Why are you so shocked? Not you. They're already down there. Yes. Hold this. Let's go. Out! Come on. Come on, let's go! In preliminary questioning, the witness credibly stated that she was expecting a courier with a large sum of money. You can't tell the court that you had nothing to do with the courier's money. Defendant, admit that these professional revolutionaries dragged you into this matter. The judge thinks you're an inexperienced woman. You were tricked into doing it. Even if it's inconceivable for a judge of the Third Reich that a woman might act on her own will... I was not misled. I acted on my own conviction, of my own free will, and I will always do so. Hermann... Hermann... 10 years... I can't be reading this right. With her only relative now dead, I ask your permission to marry Hella Lindau, now serving time in Waldheim. Is this a joke? She has no one else but me. If you're up to something... If you had something to do with that money, Reimers... They investigated for a year, then shelved it. As far as I know, the money never existed. I'm warning you: Stick to selling things and stay out of politics. - You're a peddler, right? - Yes. How's a professional revolutionary get around with a peddler's tray? I make it work. There, that's how we like you. Well... Maybe you'll learn someday. One can always hope. Out! May I come back soon to ask again? Why didn't we just believe Hella? Irene worked with us reliably for 11 years. Back then... Do people always stay as they were when we first met them? I can't think of anything else anymore. It's time to bring in the hay. Hilde comes by a lot now. She helps me. They'll let me write to Hella now. Thank you for helping father. It was our agreement! Well, thank you, regardless. She's my wife now and I'm her husband. I know. If there's any way I can help... Not here! Come on! Veils off! Come on! Hurry up! Maria, divine image, Filled with God's grace, Happily I confess to you, You are my guiding star. Prisoner 47, 10-year sentence, treasonous conspiracy. 1 year and 10 months served. Is that all you've done? Poor and few. Few and poor. Alright. You should've thought of that. There'll be consequences. Quick! Quick! Hurry up! Get in there! Clothes off, you cherubs! Quick! Off! Faster! Get on with it! At least let them keep their shirts on. Shut your mouth! It's house rules! Take your rags off! I'll teach you! Why are you beating those women? Shut up! Stop torturing them! Number 47, I'll report you! Down. 12 days. Please... Please... Vermin for vermin! Hello... Hello? When will you come... No, no... Don't, don't... Out! Let's go! Keep going! Here, from your fiancé! Soon, sweetheart, soon! They just gave me permission to visit. We'll see each other this Sunday. I've been singing for joy all day long. The song about the snowy mountains and the fountain that we used to sing. Remember it? From it I have drunk many a cool drink. I have not grown old, I have not grown old... Quiet up there! I'm still forever young. Wait here. Wait here. Sick? No. Due to her extremely poor work performance, permission to visit Lindau is withdrawn. Hermann. Hermann! Hermann! Such theatrics with this one! Muzzle it! Shut up! - Lindau! - Bertram! - Lindau! - Stop! Stop! Stop! Come back here! Lindau! Lindau! Lindau! Lindau! You asked for it! Off you go! See? You can do it! Why not from the start? My sweetheart, we'll see each other soon. I can't wait for the minutes with you. My beloved husband! There's so much I want to tell you. So much to say. So much. My love. My love! Prisoner Lindau! I can't... She has to get out of there! Or it'll kill her. No one can survive a place like that. A plea is useless without Hensch's signature. That bastard Hensch. How can we get to him? Hensch? Hunting people and keeping bees... that's all he cares about. What? I request permission to leave the city for 18 hours to visit my father. Yes. Sit. You've traveled to see your father quite a bit lately. All my colleagues mock me. See, I'm crazy about bees and, you see... My father can't do it alone, the bees have to go. Wait, you're a beekeeper? Everyone's passionate about something. Hmm... Rapeseed-a blind man could see it. Locust tree. Meadow, but there's something else in there too... Linden. Astounding! See, this is something real. Honestly, I also came about my fiancée. So she'll know as soon as possible where her home will be. You know what she'll look like when she gets out? 7 more years. 6 years... if she survives. Come now. Don't exaggerate. Solitary confinement. Her third year. Who gets through that? I'm very worried. Anyway, she's a woman. File a request, Reimers. You're surprised, Lindau? Yes, very much, Warden. Our prison library satisfies even demanding tastes, I assure you. You have a brave man on the outside. Yes, Warden. We're a bit unusual here. I'll grant you 4 books as your private library. Thank you, Warden. - You want to work? - Yes, Warden. Well, what can you do? I can do laundry, Warden. Well, then you'll do laundry. Thank you, Warden. Thank you. Head Staff Sergeant Olser! How will you handle this after so long in solitary? Frenzel! Incoming! Introduce her! Your vat. Yours alone. Officials' laundry. Only politicals get to do it. Not much soap for so much laundry. Muscle soap! Always use lots of elbow grease. There. You're a political? - And you? - No, thank God! But not murder either, like the rest of them. - Hey... - Quiet! - What songs are big now? - Quiet! Quiet! Yours. No one else can use it. For officials' laundry only. They always pick a political for that. Murderers' hands may not touch officials' laundry. Not even mine. - How long? - 10 years. Who did you kill? - And you? - 8 years. Officials' laundry at the gable end. - Psst... Were you on transport? - No. Hey you! Come here! Come on. Open that. Yeah, there. Nice, huh? Not allowed! Maybe in 7 years! Get back to work! You too, lazy cow! Damned devil! She corrupted country girls. Turned them into whores, the old donkey. Now she's got piles of money in the bank. - That's my tub! - What? It's mine! I've told you 1,000 times! Get out of here! - Ow! - Get lost, you old... Go away, you stupid, useless cow! I told you this is my tub. Period! You want to tear into her? Shut your mouth. Tomorrow we'll wake you a half hour before the others. You'll check the weather and decide if we dry the laundry in the courtyard or in the drying attic. God have mercy on you if it rains on the laundry. If it's raining early, no one will wake you. Why me? It's goes with the officials' laundry. What songs are big now? - Tell us! - Zarah Leander, right? - What's in style now? - Are pant-skirts still in? I looked pretty stylish in those. I had one in gabardine and one in Glen plaid. Quiet! Quiet back there! - Hurry up! - Your name is Hella? That's a nice name. I'm Helene, but people call me Lenchen. I had the Glen plaid made by a tailor in Luckenwalde. I always had tailored suits. The milliner was from Luckenwalde too. We could afford it. My husband wore only custom-fitted shirts. I preferred a charmeuse. I looked so sweet in pink! A blacksmith, I thought, but what good did it do? Snoring and sleeping... Snoring is awful. The dumb slut tried to saw through the old man. With a serrated knife. To stop the snoring. And then slept with the blacksmith's apprentice. He was only in the hospital a few weeks... and I got 8 years! The shrink said I must've fallen in love with the apprentice. It was my fate! What you dream the first night will come true. You need to remember it. I dream every night. He said I had the most beautiful breasts he'd ever seen. Shall I show them to you? I saw them earlier. But now it'd be so nice and secret. Look, Hella. Look now. Come, Lord Jesus, be our guest, and let these gifts to us be blest. Amen. For you. Haeckel's Riddle of the Universe, and From Distant Worlds, one volume each of Morgenstern and Rilke. I am alone with all this human pain I came here to relieve, and in your name, Thou that art not. I thumbed through The Riddle of the Universe... how cells are replaced every 7 years. Everyone should really know something about that. One thinks life is simple and yet... it's not simple at all. It's quite hard. Have you been here a long time? Put the books in the locker. Go to work. You've read so many books yet you still ended up here. It's because I've been reading. Once I learned a poem too. Into the woods my way I went, To seek for nothing that was my intent. A shaded blossom befell my sight, Like gleaming stars, like eyes a-bright. Like eyes a-bright... I longed to pick it, -but it said sweetly: Should I be picked to wilt so fleetly? That's beautiful. - Don't you agree, Miss Konrad? - M-hm. Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger! Völkischer Beobachter! Non-Aggression Pact Signed! - With France? - No, with Moscow. GERMAN-SOVIET NON-AGGRESSION PACT Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger! Non-Aggression Pact Signed! - Precision cutters are your field. - Yes sir. Have a seat. You have a job starting tomorrow. Here's the paperwork. You'll report to us once a week. Well? What do you think? I don't understand. Have you read the paper this morning? Brilliant move, isn't it? I don't know what you mean. Then just get going. You'll know what we mean soon enough. Well, Lindau, we're allies now. With the pact? This is... our foreign minister... and that's your Stalin, right? Now, now, back to work. Is this true? Yes. England and France won't ally with the Soviet Union. Are they against Hitler or for him? Think, Hella, think. Quiet! Quiet, I said! Hurry up with the mending, 47! They're saying Hitler should do what he wants to Moscow. Number 47, get out! Think it through, Hella-who's against who. For the last time, get out! Think, Hella. My god, think. Step by step: France won't ally with Moscow to oppose Hitler. England doesn't want an anti-Hitler pact either. Ok. Who really gets this stuff? Think clearly. Don't get mixed up. Don't get off course. Hitler must attack the USSR sometime. In Paris, they're waiting for it, so put it off and buy time. That's it. Yes, buy time. The pact guarantees... guarantees... The pact guarantees peace for a while, no war. No war, that's very important. Is it true? Yes, it is. It is. Are you sick? Me? No. Don't panic, don't panic. Where was I? Not for it. But what's the alternative? What if it's down to us against England and France... with Hitler? With... with Hitler! Oh god, not that! Please not that! Anything but that! Hella. Hella! What's up with you? Come here to me. Come on. It'll all be alright again, dearest. Hermann... There's solace for everything. Hermann... what still counts? I understood the question in your letters very well, dear. You need not doubt my loyalty. Nothing has changed between us. We can choose whichever path we want, but the end point doesn't change. Everything has been carefully considered. We're still the same as we were. Us. Ok? Yes. We just have to rely... And we do. Always wear that suit when you come. That's how I always picture you. I'd be glad to send a photo of me in this suit, if they'd let me. I got a camera recently. Do you take a lot of pictures? Everywhere I can. The skin is cracking. I have a vacation day. I'll stay here in town. Understand? Tomorrow morning I'll go for a walk. Sounds nice. Think about it when the clock tower tolls. At 8. At 9. At 10. At 11. I'm always thinking of you. I'm doing ok here. Don't worry about me. Thank you for your concern. I know, I have you to thank for it. Tell me about yourself. You do your work... and your duty. Hermann. Hermann! Your photo project was a reckless violation of common sense and norms. I know. You're right. I won't happen again. So where's Hella? Here, behind this shutter. There are things that our sort hardly understand. But your heart must feel lighter now, no? The Führer was a soldier too. He knows what war means. He doesn't want war. You can count on that. What would you be doing now, if you were free? Astronomy. And you? You know, I was 18 when I got here. My parents were prison officials. My grandparents too. When you're young, you don't think about it much. What's with your hands? Some scabs. You have to urinate on them. That helps. But you see, work has meaning here. You can't just let thieves and murderers go free. No. It all made sense to me until 5 years ago. Then suddenly there are people like you here. Haven't you ever thought about getting married? As you can see, I was never that pretty. Once there was a lathe operator in a factory in Chemnitz. But he never came back, once he heard what I do. Everything used to be simple, you know? I always came here in the morning, usually happily. The prisoners were easy to get along with. We used to play rummy a lot. Four of us were friends. Once a week we went to the movies and to choir practice every Thursday. You like to sing? Yes. Me too. M-hm. I mean, I used to. Back then. The German people and their soldiers. An indivisible solidarity in the struggle for freedom and the greatness of the Reich. In the homeland, in the homeland... in the homeland, in the homeland, there we'll meet again. Surely your fiancé would've never thought it possible: Denmark, Norway, Holland, Belgium, France, and now to Athens. And all in just one year! I'm happy for you, Lindau. After the final victory, surely there'll be an amnesty. - Are your hands better? - Yes. Good! Yes? Miss Konrad is bringing someone new. Ok, ok. Go back to work. Awful person, isn't she? Come here. Turn it over and read what it says. Workers Co-op Society, Chemnitz. Yes. I was a member for 14 years. Even a board member. I got that in recognition of my work. I... can't part with it. I can't. Well, why should you? Frenzel handles it every morning. If she finds out what it means, she can denounce me. In short: it's your job now, ok? Miss Olser... I don't like being served, but here I must. They won't even let officials cook for ourselves. I can't risk it. Please. Yes? A new person for the ironing. Where are you going?? To get Frenzel so she can give her instructions. From now on, that's your job. Congratulations, Lindau. You're moving up here. Juvenile, 9 years, accessory to murder, 8 counts. - I'm Hella. - Elsie. Come on. If you loused things up for me with Olser, you're dead. Here... Your iron, your laundry. If you have questions, I work over there. You! Here we do what we're told. That goes for both of us. Remember that. It's raining! You stupid cow! You filthy dog! You imbecile! Do it all again. Clean by morning. Say thank you to Lindau! Go! Go! Go! You piece of shit! Let's go! Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday! You pig! Once more and you're dead. Would you get in your tub, old fat-ass? I'm not getting in today. Smelly and afraid of water. I can't and that's that. Ok? Why can't you today? You don't get it! My rose is still blooming! You only have old, frayed drapes left to offer! You're all just jealous! You're as dry as sandpaper! You're all just jealous. All of you, jealous! Even of my nice, big belly! Why do you think he always wanted it? Why did he always want to sleep with me? So he could get it up with his fillies! Ooh, you old whore! You filthy pig! Stop it, you...! Then why did you stab him in the guts with an SA dagger? You said yourself how you knifed him... how you lost your mind! Because he told his sluts how disgusting it was with you! Why should pimps have it easier than us? - You pity them? - The pigs don't deserve it! Listen to me! I swear! I swear on my mother's grave! I swear! It wasn't revenge! I did it for love! My God! My God! Out of love! God gave you a life sentence for it. Any more about love and we'll beat you dead! I was like livestock... He turned me into a sow in a stall. 17 years a sow...! Get back! Stop! Back off! Back off! He was my one and only. Pluck out my eyes: I can see you Stop my ears: I can hear you Break off my arms, I grasp you With my heart like a hand. Arrest my heart and my brain will beat... I saw you 3 times. Arrest my heart and my brain will beat. The first time, you talked about astronomy. I understood almost all of it. I'm still going to read up on it. The second, it was about history. Luther. Then, I heard you singing. It was Ännchen von Tharau. I thought, "I want to work with him." See? Now we work together. It's nice! June 21, 1941. Pluck out my eyes: I can see you... German people! We have begun a deployment of such magnitude as the world has never seen before. Our formations on the Eastern Front range from East Prussia to the Carpathians. The hour of the final battle against Bolshevism is upon us. Today, I have decided to put the fate and the future of the German Reich and our people back in the hands of our soldiers. May the Lord God help us in this struggle. Adolf Hitler, Berlin, June 22, 1941. We will include in our prayer a plea for God's blessing for the victory of the German army. Pray! Officer, Sergeant Olser wants Lindau. We got a new one. A political. - What's your name? - Barbara. Sorry to have to welcome you here. Come with me. What's happening on the Eastern Front? You're a political, right? This, that-it's all yours. - How many years? - 20. Infanticide. Here, Bobbie. No one has ever called me Bobbie. Initial operations against Soviet Russia quickly yielded tremendous results that we can only barely grasp. It is ever clearer that the battle of annihilation east of Bialystok was a turning point of world-historical scale. Incredible chaos has broken out in the Soviet armies, which were to spear Germany in the back and carry the torch of Bolshevism to Europe. It may be weeks before our bold, advancing forces can tally up the countless prisoners, materiel, and other spoils they have amassed behind enemy lines. Thankfully, our own losses have been low. Deutschland, Deutschland über alles... Didn't you have any guns? The world would've been better off! What do men do but screw, stink and make war? I killed 8 of the scumbags, but you all were too dignified for that, right? And now you're crying! Don't be so mean to her, Elsie dear. Don't get sick, Hella. Don't cry. Please understand what Elsie dear said. Don't think badly of her for it. Please understand, she's just barely grown. She didn't really do it. It was the guy. She was just there. He shot them one after the other. When they were at school together, he'd insult her: You bastard! You bastard! And what gave him the right? What? Just that her mom was a whore. She could hardly read when she had to see her mother on the mattress: the booted guys on top of her, the moaning and howling. She sat in the corner wailing: Mama, mama... The boy had no idea about her crappy life. But he went nuts for her, a dog in heat, always pushing. You know how they are when they want it. First they grovel bended knee, then they spit on you. And the whole time: You bastard! You bastard! So she says: He who wants me must pay. If you've got money, you can have me. Then 3 of them formed a gang. She was the bait. She lured johns into the woods and before their pants were down, the gang came and... They did in 8 guys that way. Then one day the boy said: Now I've got the money. Now it's my turn. I want to sleep with you. She said: Never! I just wanted to show you what a bastard can do to someone like you. No men for me, ever. You all make me sick. So the idiot runs off to the next bar, gets completely drunk. Then he spills the beans, stupid asshole. Can you understand her now? She can't help it. She's really still a child. A poor, unloved, cold, angry child. But she loves you a lot. I know it. We all love you. Hermann... Hermann... The Wehrmacht's model teamwork has now yielded historic success. The German people owe their deepest gratitude to these brave soldiers. The armies are roaring eastward Into Russian land Comrades, take up your arms Victory is close at hand! From Finland to the Black Sea Forward! Forward! Forward to the east we charge! Freedom's our goal! Victory to our flag! Führer, give your orders! We'll follow you! Führer, give your orders! We'll follow you! Have you heard? Just wait, Hella. It's a big country. You'll see. 2 or 3 more months. This is my last time doing this. I'm leaving. There's no future here. I don't want to end up like Olser. I've always admired you, how you deal with these murderers. You're a good influence on these women. And you'll be out in 4 years. I'm really not allowed, but... I'd like to shake your hand. You've earned it. Best of luck. Here's a few calories for your POWs. And it looks like we'll need more. By the way, I'm getting married. Really? I'm happy for you. All the best! I'm marrying into a farm and I can do what I want there. I can bring you more food. Do you have anyone? Or shouldn't I have asked? The wedding will be when he's home on furlough. He'll get benefits as a married man. It's also good for the farm to have a woman there. Ah, this is familiar to you. I get along well with him, too. God knows what'll happen later. It's the third week she hasn't said a word. I'm buying war bonds. Hella! What's going on? Don't get sick, Hella. Hella, do you hear me? Hella, my love. Hella! Speak to me. Come on! Say something! Come on! You always wanted to know why I'm a political. The fourth... With my fourth child, it was political. The first, I was 14. The farmer's son. They put me in a juvenile detention center. They stomped on my belly, but the baby was still there. They took it away immediately. With the second, I escaped in a garbage bin, went right to my boyfriend. He was from the center. Pregnant again. Out. I slept in the park and the police came. And I was back at the center. I was already crocheting: caps, little jackets, all that. It was another boy. They took him away. Then I came of age. I thought: the fourth one, that one's yours. He wanted it too. He was doing his labor service. Then, in the hospital, he didn't want it. The baby came. It came. And so why are you a political? It was the most beautiful of all. When they came for the baby, it was already dead. It didn't feel a thing. And I screamed: I've already given your Hitler 3 sons! And that was political. Come on. Hey! A visitor! Well, Lindau? Surprised? What do you think? I don't shake hands with murderers. - Sit! - Back to work! A-ha! just as I thought! Fever! Everyone back to work! Get that dog out of here! There will be consequences. Move it! Move it! Back to work! Lindau, go to the doctor! I don't want to go to the doctor. It's my decision to make! I'm filing a report. You're far too easy on them! Inge, listen! I've known you all your life. Don't do anything rash! - I'm filing a report. - I was in school with your mother! I'm filing a report. You won't do it. Or I'll file one too. What? Yes. See, I saw how you sicced your dog on them. - They're not used to that. - Heel! If they panic, it's your fault. Dogs are prohibited here. Prohibited. Fine. Lucky break for Lindau. But you watch out. My God. My God. Oh Hella, you're just skin and bones. Just skin and bones. And the hunger is just starting. Look at how fat Lola is. Be nice to her. Then you can get anything from her. She loves us both. Do what you want. Little Elsie, my dear, look what I have. Look! I got permission to bring you a pencil on my next visit, - and 200 grams of sugar. - Hella! - He's dead! He's been killed! - Maybe I can also bring a wool vest or a scarf, or instead of sugar a big stick of margarine. And invite us to the wedding... All your friends want to send you something. Don't forget, my sweet Hella: Our thoughts are with you. The end of the dark times is on the horizon. Both my houses! Both bombed in one night! Your Allies! You'll pay for this till you bleed! Political swine! You pigs! It'll come back on you all! Whatever hardships may await us, it's now a matter of months and weeks. The day when you knock and say 'I'm here!' is getting closer. Hella, look at that nasty Elsie. Hella, help me Help me! Hermann... Hermann... I'm here! Never sick in 7 years? A political. If you go to the doctor, you'll die, she says. Pluck out my eyes: I can see you. Stop my ears: I can hear you. Footless I can go to you, and mouthless I can summon you. Strange people. Such trash. Why are we still coddling these misfits? Simon, my tea! The wedding's off. He passed through partisan territory on his way home. Is everything alright with you? Yes, everything is fine. I couldn't bring more. The checkpoints keep getting stricter. Father sends his regards. Take this. Maybe you can bring it to her. Stalingrad won't fall. Will it? The patient is unconscious most of the time. - May I? - Please. - I was told I could see her. - Yes, go ahead! You see? We're doing everything in our power. We are all at the mercy of Providence, if that word means anything to you. I have permission to give her honey. Visiting hours are now over. Ludendorff would have taken Stalingrad. Paulus. The very name: Paulus. Nurse Simon! Here you are, doctor. Get me Lindau. Lindau. Come in, please. - Your honey. - Thank you. - Here. - Thank you. Your fiancé sent The Riddle of the Universe by the materialist Haeckel, and the mystic Morgenstern, and the pilgrim Rilke. Which book helped you to triumph over death? I'll tell you. It's quite clear. Not this and not this. What helped you is that I realized that you are somehow a German person. A part of the German essence. An exception. Calling for books on death's doorstep. That's more mythical than material. That is German. Strength. Creating order. Breaking through! But never communist. You're not a communist. You think you are, but your actions give you away. To be German is to be eternally driven to overcome something-even the world. What else is your action? Race... Attitude... Imprinting. The German brain. In addition, you are beautiful. Somehow. I reject the idea that communist ideas can't also be found in beautiful people. For a time. Too bad we didn't meet under different circumstances. From your fiancé. Thank you, doctor. I'm putting you on light duty, in the library. We'll never forget it, doctor. You've always wanted to help me. Now you can. Destroy anything that connects you to me. And I do mean destroy. Don't ask why. From now on, they'll pick up the ration cards from you. Not a word to anyone. Not even father. And? How's your fiancée? Not bad, under the circumstances. - And you? - Pardon? What have you been up to? - Working. - Ah, right. And the bees? Done for the winter. What do you think, great beekeeper? I'm not sure. You should be. Fir trees. Nothing more. See? I have something else for you. What do you think of that? Nothing. Your group, the national committee, the parish leadership, and this is you, Reimers. You're under arrest. If you try to flee, I'll shoot you. Kindly put everything on the desk. We've tolerated it long enough. No kid gloves this time. You'll pay for everything. This was the last honey you'll ever taste, Reimers. From Russian bees, if it makes you feel any better. Ah, from Miss Fiancée. We're sending for her. They're taking Hella! She's being transported. Can you see? Thank you. Hella! We both know you lied before. Now we also know who you lied for. - So what about that 64,000? - I don't know about any money. When we close a case, we do it right. So you got that money from your fiancé. - I told you everything. - Did you? Now I'll tell you something, Lindau. You took the fall so your fiancé could go free. I wonder if it was worth 10 years. But now is the moment of truth. Where did he get the money? - I told you everything. - Louder! - I can't. - Can't or won't? I won't. You think you're safe from us because you're in prison! Out with it! Or you'll be in the dock next to Reimers! This time, your life depends on it! Don't stop. Keep moving, I said! Keep moving! Go! Go! Keep moving! Stupid pig! Quiet! - Hermann! - Keep moving! Go! Keep going! Faster! - Hermann! Hermann! - Quiet! Keep going! Keep going! Hermann! Get back! I said get back! My dear, dear husband. They're already at the Oder. Have you heard the thundering guns at night? How many weeks can it go on? It's the last battle. They haven't yet questioned me a second time. Stay strong, dearest. We're winning. We've already won. New inmate? Hella Lindau, transferred from prison, 10 years for treasonous conspiracy, 9 years 6 months served. 10 years? Down in the men's section- was that your husband? Yes, that's my husband. 10 years. I've often thought of death. Now it's right in front of me. I'm not afraid of it. There's much difficulty ahead for you, my dear. How I wish I could share it with you. Farewell! I embrace you. And rains cool wine. Roses don't fall from the sky Nor can the rain be... My beloved has arrived, And he's stepping through the door. It's snowing red roses, It's snowing red roses, And raining cool wine.
