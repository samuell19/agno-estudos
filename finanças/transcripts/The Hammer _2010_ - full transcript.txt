Maybe you should leave it on longer. He might just need another second or two. Ms. Hamill, you can bring Matt into the office now. Your father and I'll meet you there. That's it, huh? I've seen enough to determine a conclusive result. After a couple of flashing lights and a teddy bear, you're gonna tell me my grandson is deaf and dumb? No. After a couple of flashing lights and a teddy bear, I'm going to tell you, you have a highly intelligent grandson. Who's profoundly deaf. Interacting with other deaf children will really help. You should consider sending him to a residential school and having him learn sign language. I know it's difficult. Matt's not going to some deaf school. He's going to Loveland Elementary, just like his brother. Let's go, Janet. Dad, I want to know what our options are. I know this seems overwhelming, but millions of people have gone through this. You're not alone. All right, time for recess. Let's all line up. Matt. It's time for recess. Time for recess. Recess. We're lining up. Hike! Did you hear that one coming, deafy? Why's your brother such a retard? Wah... Wah-te. Wah-de, Wah... wah... Dad? Yeah? I've been, uh... reconsidering the residential school idea for Matt. Or at least some sign language classes. He's fine. Okay, boys. Pat, you drive for a minute. Okay. Hey, big boy. Wa-ter. Wah... Wa-ter. Wah-uh. Wa-wa-wa-ter. Wa-uh. Wa-ter. That's good! Yes. Wa-ter. Wa-du. Wa-ter. Wa-du. Wa-Wa-ter. Wa-du. Good boy. Good boy. There we go. He's a great kid, Mike, but since the divorce, things have been tough. I know he could be a good wrestler. Hey, you need something, buddy? Nah, he's fine. We've just been working on his speech. Really? Hmm? Look, Stan, I don't think this is gonna work out. I mean, it's tough enough with the kids I have, you know? How's the fam holding up? How's Janet doing? What are you asking, Mike? I was just wondering. If she's available? Well... is she? Coach. Coach. Coa. Coach. Coa. Coach. Good. I'll tell Janet you said hello. Everybody hustles out there, okay, guys? Nobody quits. Let's pair up by weight. Let's go. Come on, guys. Martin, I want you to wrestle Matt. Okay? Okay, guys. Now, listen. Keep your spacing. I want to see single-leg takedowns. On my whistle, guys. Uhh! Martin. Take it easy on him, okay? All right. Let's do this again. Oh, Stanley, what have you gotten me into? Let's try this one more time, okay? And that's where you pin him. Come on, move! All the way! All right, all right! Give yourself a hand! Nice job! ♪ Come on down ♪ ♪ To the Cadillac of love ♪ ♪ Come on down ♪ ♪ You will be back for more... ♪ All right, guys, great practice! Shower up. Great job, guys. Good job. Nice job. Good job. All right, all right. Matt, Dale, enough. Good job. Good job, guys. 6:00 tomorrow, okay? Matt. Matt. Great job out there. Great technique on those arm throws. Thanks, coach. You need a ride? No. Michelle's taking me. Have you heard from Purdue yet? Not yet. Hey. Tell your mom, Friday night, my turn to cook dinner, okay? Okay. Great job. So what are you doing today? What are you doing today? Uh, I've got another wrestling practice to go to. My brother's taking me. Oh, Pat? No his other brother, genius. Shut up. Maybe we should all go on a double date. Yeah, okay. How about you abort the conversation, viv? How about you tell someone that he smells like b.o? All right. Well, here we are, sir. Just sayin'. Stop. What? It's not like he can hear us anyway. Aww, Matt, I don't know if that's such a great idea. Why? Well, I don't know. I mean, our families have been friends for years. Wouldn't that be kind of weird? You can't dance, right? I mean, you can't hear the music. No, but I can feel the vibration, like this, you know. No. See? I'm sorry. Do you still need a ride tomorrow? No. Sorry. Bye, Matt. A note? What is this, fifth grade? Where are those boys? I swear, if they don't quit missing dinners, I'm gonna quit making 'em. Matt's picking up some extra practice over at Kenston. Pat gave him a ride. I wanted to wait till Matt got home, but take a look. A full ride to Purdue? Is this right? Oh, my God! It's one of the best wrestling programs in the nation. Oh, my God! What's this? R.I.T., another acceptance. But the other one's the one we really care about. Well, I think that we should still consider both options. There's a great deaf school at R.I.T., and he'll really get the support he needs. I'm just worried he'll get lost at Purdue. We don't need a deaf program. Do you even realize how good of a wrestler your son is? He has so much more potential than you give him credit for. He could be a national champion. Well, why don't we let Matt make his own decisions? Hey. Hi, Mom. You hungry? No, I can't. I have to cut weight. I'll eat his dinner. Pat, you don't have to gain weight for him to lose it. In the meantime... I want you to read this letter. Scholarship? There's another letter for you. Rochester? It was just a backup. Well, I guess that makes up for the prom rejection, right? You invited somebody to the prom? I have to go study now. What? Get in. Pretty exciting news that came yesterday. Yeah. You given it any more thought? What's there to think about? I'm going to Purdue, don't you think? You know what I think? Why limit yourself when you can compete with the best? That's not what Mom thinks. Your mother has your best interest at heart, always. I want you to remember that. In fact, she's dying to know what happened with Michelle. It's not that big a deal. Prom only happens once. Anything that only happens once is a big deal. I don't think she likes me. Well... if you don't believe in yourself, I'm not going to. Now get outta here. Matt, what are you doing? What time is it? 6:15! Shh! I mean, you just decided to run over here and ask me to prom? Yes! You have no idea how loud you're being, do you? No! So will you go with me? Why don't you just ask me properly at school? Okay. So you think you'll say yes? Yes! Yes, I will. Okay? Just... Go. Okay? I'll see you at school. These might be a little bit snug, but they'll do the trick, all right? So... What do you have planned after prom? Early practice for the one I'm missing tonight. There's more to life than wrestling with dudes. Women... like to wrestle, too. Oh, Matt. Matt! Matt! Matt! How do I look? Perfect. Marge, she's gonna be fine. Hi, Mr. And Mrs. Russell. Hi, Michelle. Hi. Cool car. You look real pretty. Thanks. Um, cool tux. I've got it, thanks. Thank you. It's beautiful. Let's get out of here before my mom makes my dad drive us. You want to wear my goggles? What? I can't hear you over the engine. Oh, sorry. Do you want my goggles? You want to wear it? Oh, no, thanks. They look... they look cute on you. I love this car 'cause I can feel the vibrations. Put your feet on the floorboard, close to the engine. Now close your eyes. Watch out. Are you hungry? Yeah. Yeah. I know the perfect place. Okay. I love tacos! You want me to order for you? Fine. What? I said that's fine. Hello? Can I get two number threes, please? Always get number three. He wants to know what you want to drink. Two cokes, please. Come on, hurry the hell up already! What's wrong? Hello? Any day now! Come on. Here, with your hair, you could get it way high. What happened to your hair? I'm just gonna use the bathroom. Michelle, I'll wait for you in the hallway. Matt... I... thought... you... should... Please talk normal. I just wanted to let you know that Michelle's mom came to pick her up. She wasn't feeling well, and she wanted to tell you herself. I'm sorry, Matt. K prime equals D squared Y over DX squared. Function Y equals F(X), where X and Y are naturally scaled orthogonal coordinates. Excuse me? Excuse me. Your interpreter's up here for you. Just come on. Okay, now the astringent curvature, K, of a plane curve at a given point on the curve is defined as the derivative of the tangent angle with respect to the position on the curve at that point. What is he saying? Excuse me, professor! What did you just say? I can help you. I can't see his lips. Sorry. Shuffles. Hamill. Hamill! You're late. Let's go! Shots. Man, it's the first day of practice. Come on. Gentlemen, we're going to partner up. Two-minute live go's. Hamill, I want you working with Miller. Everybody else grab your training partners. Get a spot on the mat. Let's get moving. Come on. We're going on my whistle, guys. Let's go. Stay focused, Hamill. Miller, back up. Let's get up, guys. Miller pins Hamill again. Where's your head at, son? Thanks for coming in. No problem, coach. Here's the thing, I understand that your handicap is something... I'm not handicapped. Your record's 6 and 8, Matt. I know that, sir, but... I've been working really hard. And your GPA, it's below the minimum required for the scholarship. I can get it up. I'm sorry. This wasn't an easy decision. I came here to win a national championship, sir. I know I can do it. This is the Big Ten. Don't take it personally. Matt. Hey, back in good ol' Loveland, huh? Good to see you. So, uh, my truck. Every time I pull up to a stop sign, she stalls out. I don't know what's wrong with her. Strange. Hi, Matt. Hi. You remember my wife, Michelle, right? So, uh... When should I call about the truck? Tomorrow afternoon. All right. We'll call you tomorrow. Honey, I'll be out in just a second, okay? So, um... shouldn't you be at Purdue? Not anymore. Michelle, I want to apologize for ruining your prom. Matt, don't be silly. No. It's... It's something I think about. I wish I can do it over. Well, I... I think we all know how that feels. You still love tacos? Congratulations. You'll be a great mother. Thank you. It's funny how things turn out, huh? I never pictured you as a mechanic. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It's just... I always saw you somewhere else doing something different. Thought for sure you'd make it out of here. Anyway, um, I should get going. It was good to see you, Matt. Well, Matt, who was that? Girlfriend? She's a hottie, eh? She was a hottie, yo. Didn't tell me you had a bun in the oven, buddy. Huh? What's the matter with you, huh? Why do you think you have the right to feel sorry for yourself? Don't pretend you understand what it's like to be me. You always have, but you have no idea. You lookin' for a pity party? I failed at Purdue. So what? I went there for you. Hey, I never lied to you, boy. I told you your whole life that you don't need to be treated different. But I am different. That doesn't mean you're any worse off than anyone else. The world can be cruel, no matter who you are. No one is exempt from that. But if you still want a chance at an education and a national championship, then you're gonna have to stop feeling sorry for yourself, roll up your sleeves and get back to work! Your mom convinced me, and we've done some rearranging. We're gonna send you to R.I.T. This fall. I'm not going anywhere. We're gonna refinance the house to pay for the first year. R.I.T. Said they'd consider a scholarship after that. I don't want your money. Get in the truck. I'll be back in a minute. Roll out the mat. What are you laughing at? What are you doing? Oh, so you don't think I can take you, huh? Grandpa, don't be ridiculous. Boy, I don't want any excuses. You worry about yourself. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay.

Oh, and her. This is Matt Hamill. This is Kelly. Nice to meet you. Sorry I barged in. No problem. I hope you enjoyed the show. Jay told me that he'd be getting a new roommate soon, but I was starting to think the school couldn't find anyone who could stand to live with him. Hey, give me back my shorts, lunatic. Don't be mad because they look better on me. Give 'em. Jay. Jay. Hello, Jay? Turn down the music. What? It's loud? I'm sorry. I'm deaf. I can't hear a thing. Okay, funny. It's really funny. Next time, I'm not gonna give you a warning. I'm gonna write you up. Yeah. Hey, we have practice soon. Want to eat? No, thanks. I'll stay and, um, unpack. Hamill, where you been? I haven't seen you the past three days. Running, working out, studying. Wow. You're pretty dedicated for a guy who hasn't even made the team. At least now I won't be the only deaf guy. So what weight class are you trying to walk on at? 167 167s? Same as Rezac? You're kidding, right? He's a senior and our captain. His only loss last year was to Jason Sloan from Frampton. And Sloan's a two-time National Champion. Maybe I should move up to 190. That's my weight class! You okay? In Deaf culture, when we're talking, you're gotta warn me if I'm about to run into something. Sorry. I have not been around many deaf people. I was the only deaf person in my town. That explains your crappy signing. It's fine. You're part of the Deaf world now. Trust me, you'll get the hang of it. But try not to use your voice. A lot of Deaf people here can't read lips. And most importantly, it'll hurt your chance at scoring some Deaf tail. I'm only here for one thing, national championship. Right, right. There's a senate hearing for Education of the Deaf Act. Who's that? Kelly's roommate. Kristi. She's cool, but a little too... Deaf Power. Deaf Power? You'll see what I mean. Want me to introduce you? No, thanks. I'm only here for one thing. Ladies. We've been practicing now for one month to see who's got what it takes to become or remain a part of this team. He gives the same speech every year. Nick. Give me 50. Today we decide who our starters will be for each weight class. Lose today, lose your spot. And I don't care if you're a senior. I don't care if you're Randy "Macho Man" Savage, you understand? You understand?! Yes, coach! No excuses. Coach, who's up first? Coach! Uh, 190s! 190s on the mat, let's go! Come on. Pick it up! Shake hands. Wrestle. Yeah! Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba! All right, coach, who's next? Uh, 167s! 167s, guys. 167s. Let's go! Rezac. All right, last chance for 167s. Looks like someone wants a shot at the team captain. Hey! Wrestle! Two! Takedown. 1, 2... 3, 4, 5... Time! Near fall. Three. Five, Rezac. Hamill, zero. You're up. You're down. Hammer him! Wrestle! Reversal! Two. Pin! Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!

You are the wrestler everyone is talking about. Everyone? I think you have me... C-O-N-F-U-S-E-D confused... with someone else. So... I hear you used to be a lingerie model. No. Sorry to disappoint you. I'm not sure where you got that from. I'm really the opposite of a lingerie model. I'm double majoring in poly-sci and Deaf studies. Oh, really? That's cool. Sorry. I said, "That's c-o-o-l." I'm not sure if you noticed, but most of us have a lack of sensitivity to sound. Hammer! You're the man! You the man! Thanks. I'll catch up with you later. O-K Better. Thanks. I think I'm going to take off. This isn't really going the way I planned. It's not you. Kelly told me about the party. I thought it would be a good opportunity to convince people to go testify at the Senate Hearing for the Education of the Deaf Act Bill. But... ...everyone seems a little... D-I-S-T-R-A-C-T-E-D Distracted. See you around. I want to learn more about the Senate thing. Sorry. I'll turn off my voice. I would really like to see you again. How do I get a H-O-L-D of you? I live with K-E-L-L-Y, remember? Let's go, Rezac! That's right. That's how we do it! Cantrell. Do they know this is wrestling? Why are there so many people here? They're here for "The Hammer", coach.

How'd you score that? Don't worry about it. "I'm only here for one thing." Cool, have fun. Where are you taking her? It's not a big D-E-A-L. Read this. Do you have any idea where we're going? Or are you making it up as you go along? Making it up as I go along. Seriously? Maybe. Maybe not. I used to come to a place like this when I was little. It's so calm here. Close your eyes. I can feel the ground rumbling from the falling water. Yeah. I love it's strength. It's funny because it's so powerful, yet... it has to follow the path that nature but it for it. Or you could say that it ignores nature and build the path for itself. I guess we could all learn something from that. That's D-E-E-P. Deep. Really really deep. I have to admit. I went out with you because I thought maybe the "popular Deaf jock" could help convince people to go to the Senate Hearing. But now... I don't want to ruin the moment. Well, maybe I'll help you with the Senate Hearing. And you help me by going out on another date. D-E-A-L? Maybe. Maybe not. I had a really good time. Me, too. Shh... Turn off your voice. Time! All right, work on your set-ups. Finish your takedowns, let's go! Hey, work with that group over there, Stephan. I'm gonna talk to him for a sec. You know why he beat you, right? I ran out of time. No. He had a strategy, scoring points. Yeah, but time ran out before I could... Pin him? You don't have to pin everyone you wrestle. The goal is to win, right? Takedown, reversal: Two points. Escape: One point. Near fall: Two or three points. Coach, I know all this. Doesn't matter. I know I can pin him. Even the best wrestlers, they can't pin quality opponents most of the time. You don't have to pin, just have to win. Okay? Pair up with Stephan. Where you been? Busy. Did you see that hottie? Miss Deaf Power has you on lockdown! That's the thing about women. They pull you in with the "you know what", then they slowly start taking all your time. You study less, you work out less, you start missing practice... ...you stop hanging with your boys. Anyway, did you hear the latest about Sloan? He broke some dude's collar bone. Poor guy's wresting career is over. Sloan's already been invited to the Olympic training center. He's the top recruit in the country. What's your point? What are you trying to say? I'm not afraid of Sloan. Good! I just wanted to make sure you're not getting distracted. I'd love to stay and chat but I've gotta go. Don't wait up for me. A M-O-D-E-L that explains the behavior of G-A-S-E-O-U-S P-A-R-T-I-C-L-E-S. K-I-N-E-T-I-C theory. You want to get some pizza? Focus. Should we make out? Here? A S-U-B-S-T-A-N-C-E... How do you sign it? A substance. What makes you different? When you wrestle, I know hard work and determination matter but how are you able to beat so many people? I don't know... I just block everything out. It's a gift. A substance... If you keep this up, you... I'm working on my signing. And I try not to speak around you. You're missing the point, it's not about me. No, it is, Kristi. I'm doing this for you. English is my first language. English. We did not grow up the same way. Okay? I don't understand why you try to change me. I'm not trying to change you. I love you. I'm just trying to get you to realize your potential. Our community and school have embraced you. Yes, it's because your accomplishments as a wrestler, but... don't just be a great wrestler. Did you just say you love me? Maybe. Maybe not. What? My eyes! What are you talking about? It looks like you're doing homework. God. I'm deaf and blind! Good point. I'm out. No, stay. Oh, there's a message on TTY. Your mom tried to contact you. What happened? He had a pulmonary embolism. It's a blood clot in his lungs. He hasn't stabilized yet. They don't know if he's going to. Come on, let's go get some coffee. Okay. Dad... Show Matt what you learned. Pat, we should go. Come on. Hi, Grandpa. Hey. You won last week. 10 and O. Not bad. You did it, huh? Not yet. National championship's not till next week. You have always been a champion. You're signing? If you can't beat 'em... Join them. You're always been different, better. Don't ever give up. I love you, Matt. I love you, too, Grandpa. We must engage our politicians, the officials we elect to make sure they are fighting for our needs. But if we don't make them aware of those needs then it's our own fault if nothing gets done. History has shown that we can make a difference from within the system. It's our own fault if we... ...continue to be silent. Please take a flyer with which has details about the petitioning process and contact information for your state legislature and local congress representatives. Thank you for coming and being a part of this. Hi. Hi. Jay told me. I'm really sorry. Thanks. My grandpa, he would never let you feel sorry for yourself. He said that when people let you down, you just have to rely on yourself. So that's where you get it from. I'm really sorry for your loss. But how could you disappear for a week without telling me where you were going? I had to find out from your roommate? Don't you think I'd want to be there for you? To help you? I don't need anyone's help. You know. I was wrong. The problem isn't that you speak more than you sign. The problem is that you don't communicate at all. I'm really sorry about your grandfather. I know he meant the world to you. Kristi. Where is he?! Where is he? There he is! Look who decided to show back up! Look who decided- Coach! I can't understand you! Cantrell! Where the hell is Cantrell? Tell this little piss-ant that if he has the nerve to disappear, not return our phone calls, then cha-cha-cha back here like nothing happened... Coach, his grandfather just died. I just heard myself. Grandfather. Matt... This school and the athletic department has very stern rules, one of which is if you miss more than three consecutive practices, then you're unable to participate in the following match. Coach! It's the Nationals! Exactly, which is why I had to spend the entire week covering for you with the athletic director. You should have called. You know, kept us in the loop. You might think the world revolves around you, Matt, but what you don't understand is that wrestling's also a team sport. Fix this chalkboard, Cantrell.

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 1997 Division 3 NCAA Wrestling Championship. We've got a great crowd here today at R.I.T. Come on now! R.I.T! R.I.T! R.I.T! Out of bounds! Ride him! Ride him! Ride him! Yeah! Come on! Jay Jakubowski of R.I.T. loses by disqualification. Are you crazy? Coach, that was his fourth violation. Hey, genius, he's deaf! Maybe he didn't hear you, huh? Coach, here's your warning. Unsportsmanlike conduct. Give me a break! You're still super hot. With the semi-final round completed, we will now move into the final matches for each weight class. So... Here we are. Seems certainly fitting that this is how it's coming to a close. Jason Sloan, two-time national champ, against Matt Hamill. Whoever wins tonight will forever be called a champion. For Sloan, well, he's looking to be called a three-time national champion. That's what's at stake for him. That's how bad he wants it. And the only thing standing in the way of everything this guy has ever worked for... is a sophomore walk-on. So what's at stake for Mr. Hamill? Winning the national championship, no doubt. That's not really it, is it? When you guys go back in that gymnasium, I want you to look in the stands. I want you to look in the crowd... because those are the stakes. If your hand is raised at the end of the match, not only will you be called a champion, but I guarantee you'll have inspired thousands of others to do the same! All right! All right! Let's bring it in, guys! Come on! Matt Hamill, a sophomore walk-on out of R.I.T., is set to take on Jason Sloan, two-time national champion, out of Frampton, for the 167-pound national title. Hamill... you got this. It's up to you now. Good luck. Crush him. R.I.T! R.I.T! R.I.T. Hamill's had a great first season here, but hasn't come close to facing a wrestler with Sloan's ability and consistency. Regardless, they both look ready to go, and this should prove to be an exciting match-up. And we're under way. Both wrestlers seem to be feeling each other out here. Hamill keeping some good wrist control. Come on, Matt! You got him. Both wrestlers are really on top of their game here. Ah, Sloan tries a shot there, but Hamill's not having it. Two. Takedown green! Two-nothing, Sloan. And now he's throwing in his legs. Probably gonna try his power half. And out of time. Back to the middle, guys. Well, Hamill got lucky there. He didn't give up any back points. Matt! Let's go! Come on! So now we're going into the second period with Sloan at two, Hamill zero. And here's the coin toss. Green, your choice. Top, bottom, neutral or defer? Green defers. Red... top, bottom, or neutral? Red takes down. Let's go, Matt! Here we go. Hamill obviously trying for an escape or a reversal. He's up. Come on! And out of bounds, no points. Back to the middle.
