(Cuckoo clock chimes) (Child laughs) (Boy gasps) Billy, you're trying to scare me! Billy, I'm telling Mommy you're being bad! - Zap! Got you! - Stop it, Billy! Stop it! Come back to bed and go to sleep. (Billy growls) Stop it, Billy. I'm afraid. (Growling) Billy, will you stop trying to scare me? - What's the matter, Billy? - Watch out, sis! - What's the matter, Billy? - (Crashing) - What's going on here, Billy? - I told you, hush up. Hey, Billy, this is all wet here. Smells like kerosene. Mommy! Daddy! Mommy, wake up. Father? Mommy, wake up! Mommy? (Crashing) Father! (Siren blaring) Damn fire siren. What fire siren? - (Siren continues) - That fire siren. Don't hear a thing. (Laughs) You are sabotaging the Evans City Volunteer... ...Fire Department. Mm-hmm. Er...didn't the doctor say something about moderation? What does he know? He knows... (Mid-European accent)...what a shameless, lustful woman you are. And he doesn't want us to hurt the baby. Oh. Well, we're gonna have to be careful. Anyhow, I have a feeling that if anything happened to this baby, you wouldn't marry me. - I wouldn't take a chance like that. - Oh, that's a hell of a thing to say! I'm marrying you, not the baby. Would you believe I don't want you to go? (Phone rings) - Hey, where you going? - David, I've gotta answer the phone. - (Ringing continues) - What phone? OK. I'll make you a deal. I won't answer the phone if you don't go to the fire. - Deal. - (Ringing continues) Go on! Hello? God, that's awful. Sure, I can come down immediately. Yes, Doctor. - What's that all about? - The fire's at the dairy farm. - Mitchell's? - Mm-hmm. Yeah, those poor kids. They're both burned pretty bad. They're going to bring them into Dr. Brookmyre's office, until we can get an ambulance in from Unity. - Evans City Fire Hall. - Where's it at? That's the old dairy farm. Must be pretty bad. I could see the flames clear over at my place. Hey, Clanker! See the soldiers? - Soldiers? - Couple truckloads of 'em. - Hmm. Poor schmucks. - Wonder what they're doing here. (Dispatcher) Evans City Base, off and clear. (David) Is Dan here yet? (Man #2) Didn't see him. What's everybody looking so happy about? Give me a smoke. Don't it bother you, draggin' out like this? Somethin' to do. (Fire siren blaring) Good morning there, Judy. The Evans City Volunteer Fire Department apologizes for dragging you out of bed this way. - You got a bad mouth, Clank. - Yeah? You're late. - I was the first one here. - (Judy) David, be careful, please. - I will. - (Clank) Don't worry about him. I won't let him do anything dumb, even though I still think you picked the wrong guy. (David) You're a slob, Clanker. Ain't no girl gonna pick you. I'm gonna break your head. - Aw, ain't that cute? - Shut up and drive. (Judy) Where's Dr. Brookmyre? (Man) Are you the nurse? Who are you? Where's Dr. Brookmyre? - In the office with Major Ryder. - Major Ryder? - How many syringes do you have? - Look, what's going on here? Major Ryder will explain. We haven't got time. Break out those syringes. We're gonna need a lot of them. The girl just died. I think I can save the boy. Move, Nurse! - You've known about this for days. - We never thought it would happen. (Brookmyre) But you notified me! You must have suspected! Notifying you was precautionary. We never thought it was possible. We've got to call the hospital in Unity. We need an ambulance for those kids! I'm afraid I can't allow that. We're bringing in our own medical personnel with emergency equipment. - But this isn't the sort of thing... - Look, we've quarantined the area. We're sealing off the town. Have you got Colonel Peckem yet? Yeah. - Uh, get Dr. Brookmyre a gas mask. - Yes, sir. Yes, sir, they're certain. They have three cases reported. They're waiting for verifying blood tests. We'll need somebody from Trixie on the spot. Is that being taken care of? I'm leaving for the airstrip now. I should be in Evans City in two hours. Who knows about this? Press blackout? Yes, sir, we'll button it up. I'll be available by radio on the plane, and I'll report in from Evans City. Right, sir. Give me Major Ryder on 2C, please. Major Ryder, have you set up a perimeter around the town? Three more companies are on their way. They may get in there before I do. In the meantime, try to set up some kind of a perimeter. Nobody gets in or out of that town. Now, is that clear? This is a blackout situation, so from here on in we're using voiceprint checks for all communications. You don't talk to me or anybody else unless you got a voiceprint check. That's the order of the day. Go on, fellas, bring the hose here. We need a lot of slack. (Indistinct voices) (Man) Easy. Easy! (Firemen shouting) Sheriff, what the hell's going on? What do you think? There's a house burning. - No, what's this about the soldiers? - OK, let's move it. Clear the area around the house and let it burn out. - We can still save a good part of it. - Get the lead out of your ass and help. I want them trees down over the garage. I don't want them trees going up. There's a chain saw over by the wagon. What the hell? - (Father raving and shouting) - He just went crazy. He set that fire himself. His wife's dead. He killed her. Hey! Hey! Hey! When Mac and I first came here, he was laughing like a hyena. Then all of a sudden, like as if he'd realized what he had done, he started to cry like a baby. I got a car in there! It's gonna blow up! Come on, man! Attaboy! Squirt through that window! Come on, through the window! Oh, my trees! My trees! They're all gonna go! (Man on radio) 'That is correct. 'With the ultraviolet light operative, there is no need for your masks. 'All medical personnel to wear their masks at all times, and any civilian volunteers. 'You will need masks outside the protected area, 'but in the ultraviolet, we're considering it safe without a mask.' - How much serum do we have? - Not very much, I'm afraid. You people sure come prepared, don't you? Everything's on its way, Doctor. I can't snap my fingers and make it appear! In a couple of hours, we'll have everything we need. It's not a cure, just a strong antibiotic to build up resistance. Sir, Company "A" has arrived with the rest of the radio gear. - Where do you want it installed? - Here. This'll be temporary HQ. Sir, need a deployment for Company "B"... (Clamor of voices) - (Man) Grab this one. - I'll do it. (Man) Somebody give me a hand! What they gonna do with all this? - What's happening? - Listen to me and don't talk. There's a quarantine on the town. Everything's gonna be all right. I just don't want you and the baby exposed. - Exposed to what? - Just listen and don't say anything. It's a highly contagious virus. We're expecting several cases of it by morning. I don't want you around here. - You're gonna need me. - I need you like a hole in the head. We've got a whole army medical unit on the way. - What's the army...? - Will you listen to me? They're not going to want to let you go, so you'll have to sneak out. I want you to take a syringe and some antibiotic for David. You have to stay in town, so find David and the two of you stay away from people. Dr. Brookmyre, I think we should discuss larger facilities. If it gets any worse, we're gonna need someplace to set up an infirmary. Nurse, I'd like you to work with my doctor there. The men that haven't been inoculated will need their shots. We need more needles. These men with the ultraviolet need shots! - Follow doctor's orders. - (Man) What's all this stuff for? (Indistinct clamor) - Burn a little? - Yes, ma'am. - You're OK. - Thank you, ma'am. (Shouting) (Man #1) Come on, move your legs! (Man #2) All right, all right. Spend all day and night around here. Start moving your ass and unpack this stuff. This is HQ now. Major Ryder, you said you wanted to discuss larger facilities. Maybe we could set something up at the high school. How do you intend to let the people know about all this? How? Well, we've been promised bullhorns and loudspeakers. No telling when they're gonna arrive! - (Car door slams) - (Soldier) Hey! Wait! - (Engine cranking) - Hey! Stop! Hey, hey! (Radio) '...25 minutes before 10:00. This is Bob Lee till 12:00. 'News and sports is in 25. 'The weather forecast for the western Pennsylvania area: 'cloudy and cool tonight with a 60% chance of rain.' (Sirens blaring, firemen shouting) Come on! Let me see them asses move. We ain't done yet. Move it! Somebody can't find nothin' to do! - It's about time you got here. - Sheriff, they're setting up roadblocks. - What? - On the interstate ramps. - They got one up over on I-80 too. - What the hell gives here? They're making an announcement at church services tonight. All hell's broke loose in town. Nobody knows what's going on. - We're up to our asses in soldiers. - What are you talking about? - Where is that major? - At the doctor's office. They're setting up their gear there. They'll be headquartering over there. - Brookmyre's office? - Yeah. They're giving the soldiers injections. They say there's not enough for the town. - Injections? What's this about? - Stoney saw a truckful of 'em in town. Truckful, hell. Must be a couple hundred. - Couple of hundred? - Get your butts back after that fire. - What the hell's going on, Sheriff? - You'll know when I do. Let's go. - What do you think, old buddy? - Judy's at Brookmyre's. I got the wheels if you wanna bust in and find out what's up. Let's go. (Church bell tolling) Saturday night service is a high mass. Yes, Father. We'll try not to disturb it any more than necessary. Perhaps after the mass, I could ask the people to wait. No, Father, I have to insist. We need to inform the people. I've got to make this announcement. Father, we have the authority to do this with or without your approval. - You know the plane crash last week. - Yes. That plane contained an experimental vaccine. We're afraid that crash may have caused the spread of an infectious virus through this area. We can't give a story to the press yet. We've got to see what develops. We need some medium for reaching the people in that town. It's bad enough we didn't have adequate supplies ready. It'll be under control in a few more hours. A few more hours? That can be disastrous. You put martial law on a town, drive a perimeter around them, and you're just polarizing the situation. That army becomes an invasionary force. Those people are gonna resist. We're all concerned with Evans City, Mr. Hawks, but our primary consideration at this point is national security. (Teletype buzzes) All the citizens are being rounded up together in a central area, that'll solve the communications problem and check any spread of the virus. Telephone and telegraph are cut off except inside the Evans City limits. They've jammed the air to prevent any ham stuff from going out. You've got to get the president on the phone. We've got to get a nuclear weapon in the air above that town. - Isn't that a little drastic? - None of us wants to resort to that. But we've got to be ready. If Trixie jumps that perimeter, this thing could spread over the entire continent. All right. Get me the president. We'll recommend that he instructs SAC to send a plane on a training mission over Evans City. Find out what size weapon it should carry to burn out the infected area. - Any report from Trixie? - They haven't rounded up the team yet. But several of the ones they reached are already airborne. They're on their way to Fort Dietrich. - We need somebody in Evans City! - Trixie was gonna recommend a man. Oh, the hell with that! Get the first Trixie man that arrives! Have a plane at Dietrich and get him on it! - Biggest goddamn boners of all time! - The first man, understand? - Dietrich? - Don't bother to check him in. We're not to even check you in, sir, just get you on that plane. What's going on? Look, I'm a key man on the Trixie team. A key man! I'm one of the developers of the goddamn thing! I gotta have access to a lab and my computers. We're to get the first man on the team in the field, sir. Jesus Christ, this is so random! A lousy technician is what you need! Fly me to Evans City and you're tying my hands, don't you see that? Without access to that equipment, I'm useless! You'll have to clear this with command. Don't you realize the consequences? Stop the car. - I'm sorry, sir. Those are the orders. - Orders, my ass! Stop the car! You'll have a hell of a time getting me on that plane, soldier. Maybe so, sir, but we'll do it. (Man #1) That's the last we have. (Man #2) Can I have a hand over here? (Screaming) (Ryder) Voiceprint check is a waste of time. We gotta make snap decisions. If I can't get through without a 5-minute delay, I gotta authorize all these decisions on my own. I don't like that position. I know, I know Peckem will be here, but until then I'm in charge. I don't like being a brass asshole. I'm not an infantry man, I'm Chem Corp. Remember that? You don't know what it's like out there. How can I hold a perimeter and fight a small-scale war at the same time? I need those additional men! Many of the people in the outlying area are farmers, and they've got weapons. You expect us to lock up our end, huh? What about your end, damn it? All right, I'll see what we can do. They're meeting with more resistance, and they've run into a few more cases of infection. Major Ryder's requesting more men. I'll wait for Colonel Peckem's evaluation. Sir, if... Peckem'll be in there by 2:00. They can hold out till then. We have a man in there telling us maybe they can't. Oh, come on, Frank! This is a highly organized, riot-trained army. You can't tell me that they're unable to hold the perimeter on a small town through early morning. (♪ Rock music playing) (♪ Music stops) - (Soldier) Please! - Listen up! Listen up! Town is under quarantine. We have you all under martial law. We'll take you all to the high school. We'll explain it to you over there. (Indistinct shouting) (Man) Hey! Hey! Hey! - The place is under emergency... - (Woman) Get out! - (Girls scream) - (Woman) Wait! I want a lawyer! (Screaming) (Girl) Mommy, what's happening? (Soldier) Come with us, ma'am. Now, hold on, fellas. just what's going on here? We're not going no place till we know more about this! - Ah! The lights! - Where's Mommy? My mother! Get out! It's my mother! Tell me what this is all about, and maybe I'll cooperate with you. What's going on? Let go! Please tell me what you're doing! Wait! Wait! No! I'm not going! Larry! Hey! What's going on here? - Where are we going? - I want my doll. - What's going on? Let me go! - Come on! Come here, little fella. (Toy gun fires) (Indistinct shouting) (Boy) Hey, leave her alone! - (Child screams) - Hold it! (Clamor of voices) - Don't give me that shit, boy. - That's all right, soldier. That's right. 0900. Check. Listen to me, Ryder. Buck's been telling me what's going on here tonight. I don't mind telling you we're mighty tired of being pushed around like this! (Ryder) Yes, sir, I know. We've just had no way of preparing anybody for this. It just snowballed on us and we were forced to take action. You said it would never come to this! We've cooperated with you. We've attempted to keep this thing quiet in order not to create a panic. - But, Christ, we never expected this! - Neither did we... sir. We're trying to get everyone into the high school. We're setting up an infirmary there. - Are we under martial law? - Yes, sir. Let me tell you, you just can't walk all over the people of Evans City that easy. And as mayor of this town, I'm protesting your action. In fact, I'd like to speak to somebody higher up. Yes, sir. I'm Colonel Peckem. - Major Ryder? - Yes, sir. I assume we don't need the masks in the ultraviolet. (Ryder) That's correct, sir. I'll be with you gentlemen in just a minute. I want to speak with Major Ryder and find out exactly what's been happening. - Major? - Yes, sir. Right this way. I'll be a son of a bitch. - You don't smoke, you bastard. - No. Where am I gonna get me some smokes? - Hey, Clanker, that's Judy. - Sure it's her? I'm sure. She's heading out to the fire. - You sure? - Yes, I'm sure, damn it! Hey, be cool, buddy. We'll get her. (Radio) '...rainy and 65 outside the Big "K" studios.' - She's giving it more gas. - She doesn't know it's us. (Radio) 'It's 10 minutes before midnight. 'Almost time for headlines with Bob Brewster. This is Bob Lee.' Judy! (Soldier) Come over to the van. (Clanker) What's all this about? We're taking everyone to the high school. - What about my car? - Don't worry. We'll take care of it. - David, I feel stupid. - Shh. You didn't know it was us. - (Soldier) Come on. - Will you tell us what's going on? - (Soldier) What's this? - Look, I'm a nurse. - What is it? - I'm a nurse, I work for Dr. Brookmyre. - I'm supposed to inoculate him. - Get in the truck! Hey, wait. He's clean. Let's go. Come on. - Hey, no problem. - OK, in the truck. - No problem, man. - In the truck. - (Clanker) I'm not causing any problems. - In the truck. Yet. Mothers. - Who's all here? - Artie Fulton. My daughter's with me. I heard you said you were Dr. Brookmyre's nurse. I'm the emergency appendectomy at Christmastime. - Kathy? - (Engine Revs) - You OK? - Yes. - Who else is in here? - That's Frank Winston. - He seems to be sick. - (David) Know what's going on? We were asleep and they dragged us out of the house. - It's a quarantine. - What? It's a quarantine on the town. Some kind of virus. (Fulton) What about the soldiers? (Judy) I don't know. - They're setting up a medical team. - We heard some shooting. - (David) What kind of virus? - Brookmyre said it was highly contagious. - And it's dangerous. - Maybe that's what he's got. Winston! - We heard there were roadblocks up. - The military's involved. - This must really be big. - David, I'm scared. It's all right. It's all right, honey. Man, ain't this some shit? (Clamor of voices and crying child) (Peckem) I want to set up a second perimeter. The inside line will continue to move downtown, bringing everything they find with them. I want the second perimeter two miles inside the first. This two-mile stretch'll be called... no-man's land. Nothing can stay on it. No one can cross it. - Talking about a lot of men. - We'll just have to get them in here. - What do we have now? - Five companies. Why is this last-minute? These deployments should've been ready! Well, the initial information was that the vaccine was harmless. You mean they didn't take any precautionary action? Routine procedure. I got here the day of the crash. Plane went down in these hills above the town. Investigators reported that the casings wound up in the river. Apparently the water flows through an underground reservoir, and Evans City is supplied with artesian systems out of that. So I stayed in town, notified the police and the town doctor to be on the alert for any high-fever symptoms or delirium. Sir, the report was, the Trixie team had deactivated the vaccine. Major, Trixie wasn't developed as a vaccine. Trixie was developed as a bacteriological weapon. (Radio) 'Comm Central calling Colonel Peckem.' This is Peckem. 'Sir, we have completed your voiceprint check...' - That's why the blackout. - What? I knew the blackout was to avoid embarrassment, but a bioweapon never occurred to me. (Sighs) I fell for that story hook, line and sinker. - That was the idea. - (Radio) 'Colonel Peckem...' (Man #2 on radio) 'No, his first name.' (Man #1) 'Christopher. Chris. Chris.' 'This is Brubaker, Chris. Glad you're there. 'Major Ryder's a competent man and a good officer, 'but I get the feeling he's hitting the panic button too prematurely.' - (Peckem) Mr. Brubaker... - 'You want a real evaluat...' - Mr. Brubaker? - '...what's it really like out there.' Mr. Brubaker, we're running out of time! If you want me to get the job done, get me the stuff I need and get it before the morning's over! (Brookmyre) Let us move over to the high school! - We haven't got the room here! - They're clearing the infirmary area, sir. We'll move over there as soon as they complete disinfecting. I've heard that for the last three hours. "Equipment and personnel are on their way!" Why can't we call Unity? Surely we can let them in. - We need that equipment! - I'm sorry, sir. We can't let them in. We don't know how long this quarantine'll be in effect. We're talking about the lives of the citizens of this city! We're also talking about the lives of many of our own men, sir! Your men are your worry, Sergeant! The people of this town are my worry! - Message for Major Ryder, sir. - He's with Colonel Peckem. I'll take it. Heavy assembly, sir, at the interstate highway. One of the trucks blew up with masks and filters. We have a lot of men hurt. - Any civilian casualties? - Three dead, sir. Now, you just listen to me, mister. In addition to being mayor of this town, I also happen to be a practicing attorney and I know the rights of civil law. Sergeant, I want a weapons search of the entire town. That's stores included. Confiscate everything. Just a minute! I'm demanding a writ of habeas corpus. Sheriff, I've gotta take your weapons. (Mayor) Now, you just hold on! Don't you give 'em to him. You don't have to! - Soldier. - You just can't push us around this way! Don't you do it, Bucky! What the hell is going on here anyway? Sheriff, you're in a hopeless situation. Don't make us use force. - Let's go. - What we're doing here is for... - Let's get the hell outta here! - (Mayor) Watch it, Bucky! - Every civilian weapon... - (Gunshot) I want every damn civilian weapon in the entire perimeter. Understand? Right away! Jesus Christ. Colonel! Colonel Peckem, please, sir! This is exactly the kind of thing we're trying to prevent! You ain't takin' me no place! Take cover! - (Soldier) This isn't getting anywhere! - He's shootin' at us! - Son of a bitch's shootin' at us! - Get in here, boy. Come on! Get down! (Soldier) Return fire! (Soldier) OK, hold your fire! All right, let's check it out! Move in! Remember, he ain't hit until I see him hit! Keep away from me. Keep away from me. I'll kill y... Lunatic, man. Take a look at this, man. Miss? A recital. Place sure is a loony bin. No wonder they want us to round 'em all up. - Check it out upstairs. - (♪ Piano music continues) Ma'am? Is that there your husband downstairs...? (Groans) Oh, Jesus. Hey! Hey! Jesus Chri... Jesus! Can't breathe. I'm bleedin' bad. - Ma'am? - Hello. (Soldier) I'm bleedin' bad! I'm bleedin'! I'm bleedin'! - Maybe we're in some kind of war. - Shut up a minute! (Truck stops) (Men shouting) - (Gunfire) - More shooting. (Close gunfire) We're in the middle of something. Them boys ain't playing games. (Indistinct shouting) - (Soldier) Check out the people! - Let's move! (Indistinct shouting) - (Gunshot) - Stop, or I'll shoot! You too, mister. You too! Let's go, mister! Get back here, or we'll shoot! I'm scared! (Screaming) No! (Man muttering) Thirty-five cents a gallon. Fifty-eight cents. Goddamn it, what's going on? What's happening? What's going on? Give me a fuckin' answer! Come on! Come on, soldier! Soldier! What's going on? - David, come on! - Hey, man! - What's going on? Tell me! - David! - Come on! - (Clanker) Why are you here? Tell me! - Come on, soldier! - David, please! (Crazy man) Crazy fuckers! I think you're all crazy. Every one of you. Pretty funny, you think, huh? I was in the army. Pull out! Let's go! (Crazy man) You knew who the people were. - (Engine revving) - (Muttering) Go on! Take off! David, the hypodermic! (Soldier) Check those two guys out over there. - They took off in the van! - Welcome, brothers! Get that guy out of the gas station. Hey, buddy! We lost 'em! - Where you heading? - I don't know! Try the hills by the country club! Maybe we can hole up there! Got you, boss! (Shouting) (Gunfire) (Man) 'No, it only affects primates.' (Man #2) 'At least we don't have to worry about its being spread by dogs or cats.' (Man) Whatever consolation that may be to you. Unless there are any pet monkeys hereabouts, the only ones infected will be human beings. If we catch it in the early stages, can it be reversed? We searched for an antidote the three years that project was in existence, Doctor. - No dice. - How many are based in the area? I don't know. They haven't called me. Dr. Watts, I thought you... I haven't even been able to call any commanders. The radio on the plane wasn't piped through your alternate network. We're using the alternates to avoid any chance of a leak. (Doctor) Precious security. Keep it under wraps at all costs. Meanwhile, do you realize the blunder that's been made? We can have you flown back as soon as we run a complete med check. - Let's get started. - We don't have all our equipment in yet. Beautiful. And when'll that be? - As soon as possible. - Appropriately vague, Colonel. Look, it's you "think boys" who created this thing in the first place. That's beautiful! I'm one of the only chances we have. I can't get back to a lab because you're not equipped to run a medical check, which we wouldn't need in the first place if I hadn't been packed off here! - The whole operation is one fat blunder! - You talk about blunders? According to the report from your team, the virus was considered inactive. "Considered." Yes. That's the important word. Any man on the team will tell you that means 99%, maybe. That's a standard we don't set, Colonel. That's set by the military. We're not getting anywhere trying to assign blame. Then authorize me back to the lab! I can't take a chance on breaking the perimeter with somebody that might be a carrier. Trixie has been in these waters for six days! Some truck driver could've taken it out of here long before you set up that perimeter. We've got it contained and we'll keep it contained until it runs its course. - Runs its course? - It can't stay active in ultraviolet. It's in the water, man. Underground. And it's obviously in people too. People are vectors. They carry it about with them unawares. The incubation period may vary, Colonel, but ultimately Trixie is going to spread throughout this entire town! - The town is sealed off. - Oh, Colonel. Look, shortly before the funds ran out, two of my technicians caught this bug from a rhesus monkey. One of them was delirious for two days before he finally died. The other phased in and out until he finally went hopelessly mad. Those are the two ultimate effects of this thing. It's not just gonna run its course and be forgotten. How are you gonna explain a town that's either wiped out or reduced to mindlessness? Ha! Is this another piece of information they forgot to pass on to you? Oh, gentlemen, we're not dealing with a flu virus here. We're dealing with an often lethal, always debilitating encephalitic mutation. It leaves its victims either dead or incurably mad. You got that? What are you doing? Nitwit! Somebody's gonna see you out there. Christ. - I didn't mean to hurt you. - I know. It's not you. It's not what you did. You're nice. I like you very much. - Ah... - I'm sorry for being such a little girl. - It's OK, I understand. - I mean, I knew that people die. - Yeah? - I knew people died. - My father... - Your father? You understand? It's like, uh, all... all these people dying, and, uh, my father can't feel that. You can. I know you can. I... I have it, don't I? I have the disease. (Door opens and closes) Man, you better take care of your daughter, she's in pretty bad shape. - Hey, reveille, buddy. We gonna move? - We'll be right up. Hey, I found some cigarettes, man. I had to break a machine open. There's all kinds of goodies around this place. - Any food? - Yeah, food and drink. - Just don't get yourself tanked. - No, I'm just warming up. Hey, you still figure we should try to get out? I don't know, man. These new two are gonna slow us up. That chick's got the bug. I gotta think about it. - Hey, I came up with a radio. - Anything about what's going on? No, just, uh, music. It's really weird. Yeah. We'll be up in a minute. If that chick's got the bug, we could catch it from her, right? It depends on what it is. Well, it's a bug. We could catch it, can't we? - (David) We'll be up in a minute. - Yeah, OK. I mean, it's just... a little ol' bug, right? Clank, will you leave us alone for a minute? Oh... OK. (Sighs heavily) OK, buddy. You know, the whole time I was in 'Nam I figured you were old Clank's girl. - I never could figure that out. - I hardly even knew him. - I didn't know that. I saw you with him. - When? At one of the games. Good God, David. I mean, big Clank? How could you even think that? Well, I didn't know. I figured, big football hero. And I didn't really know you. I didn't know what you were like. It wasn't my fault. Action and adventure. Evans City's only Green Beret! Oh, hear, hear! Oh, Christ. I can't believe that was me. We're gonna be all right. It'll work on natural immunity. (Clamor of voices) A million to one against developing any foreign antidote in time. Sergeant, you get your ass out from behind your desk, quit calling me and telling me what you can't do and get that equipment on the double! You understand me? We're working off the census. That puts the total population inside the white perimeter at 3,613. (Man) 'Wait a minute. Say that again, Chris.' - Three-six-one-three. - (Man) 'Three-six...' We've got about two-thirds of the population accounted for, but we've got an open revolt, it's turning into a war zone. (Man) 'Wait a minute. We gotta get them into that high school. 'Chris, make that your main objective at this point. Understand? 'Don't let those perimeters break.' The perimeters are holding, but we've got about 50 square miles of woods and hills that we've still gotta cover. 'What's your estimates, Chris? How much time?' I can't tell you how long it's gonna take. 'We talking about hours, days, or what? - 'Give me a ballpark.' - I just can't. 'All right, keep it locked up, and let us know as soon as you do.' Standing order, Chuck. Get this out. Anyone obviously infected or resisting is to be treated as an enemy, with the ultimate objective to bring them in at any cost. Yes, sir. - Chuck... - Yes, sir? - We've gotta burn the bodies. - Sir... I'll listen to any alternatives, soldier, but until I hear a good one you burn them. (Ryder) "A" Company reports two men possibly infected. Sir, the men are getting panicky. Some haven't been told why they're here. Of course not, Major. That would just constitute a security leak. One of the objectives is to keep this thing quiet, yes. But the main objective is to keep the virus contained! If those men know the truth, they break the perimeter themselves. - How can you tell? - What? Don't you see? The whole things insane! How can you tell who's infected and who isn't? They can't get the helicopters for another 15 or 20 hours. Goddamn it! There's a police bird and two city-owned choppers at the community field. Get them in the air! - What sort of authorization will I need? - Anything! Use your rifle if necessary! I want them in the air, inside the perimeter, radio-linked with the ground. Report anything they spot, and keep circling the no-man's-land day and night. Anyone in that area gets one warning shot. - Sir... - Is that clear? One warning shot. What's going on at Trixie? Take 'em upwards of days just to reprogram all that data, Colonel. Until then, we won't even be able to re-create the virus itself. And afterwards, with the incubation period, my guess is a good week to infect a new set of monkeys. We have got to start taking blood samples and start flying them out to Dietrich so they can at least have a sample of the active virus. - We can't send anything out. - We've got human guinea pigs here. Over 3,000 shots at finding an immune, but we've got to start taking blood and start flying it out. - We can't send anything out yet. - Can't you see? What do you want to do, send 'em out in empty pop bottles? - (Sighs) - We need airtight canisters. I've requested them along with the other decontamination gear. Hmm... I don't mean to jump on you, Colonel. It just amazes me at how shoddy this operation is. Nothing amazes me anymore, Doctor. Nothing in this goddamn army amazes me. I'm a combat man. I shouldn't even be here. Just happened to be available. Maybe expendable. I'll get your samples out to Dietrich. In the meantime, why don't you get off your ass and start collecting them? Well, does that high school have a chem lab? - Yes, sir. - I'm gonna need some things. - Medical will set you up. - Can I have a radio? - Man needs a radio, soldier. - Man needs a radio. I need a... Man needs a radio. (Man on loudspeaker) '...will be tested and treated for the virus. 'Do not resist. They are preventive measures to ensure your survival.' (Indistinct chatter) - (Soldier) Twenty. Twenty. Very good. - Fantastic. I'm getting out of here! I'm getting out of here! Aargh! Outta here! Getting outta here! I'm getting out of here! Maybe we're doing the wrong thing. Maybe we should go back to the van and try to get back into town. - The army may just be here to help. - The man thinks the army is our friend. (Fulton) I just don't know we're doing the right thing. (Clanker) Ask Sheriff Cooper. (David) Whatever they're here for, it's turning into a riot. Maybe they are just here for control. If they can turn a campus protest into a shooting war. Some of the rednecks in this area could shoot each other and not even care why. So whatever's going on, we're better off away from it. What about the virus? Kathy is acting strangely. We may all have been exposed. We may need medical attention. I've been thinking. Maybe somebody's hitting us with bacteriological weapons or something. Maybe we are in a war. (Fulton) I just wanna be sure we're doing the right thing. Well, we can't be sure, damn it! Brookmyre told Judy to keep isolated. That's good enough for me. You can go back to town if you want to. (Clanker) The army ain't nobody's friend. We know. We been in. I don't know about you, but, uh... I'm gonna stick it out with David. Cos he's gonna make it. He's got a brain. (Priest) The church is a holy sanctuary! These people have sanctuary! Leave them alone! Leave them alone! Sanctuary! (Baby crying) OK, let's go. God is with us! - (Screams) - (Soldier) Come on! Move! In! Come on! - (Woman screams) - In! In now! (Shouting and screaming) - (Gunshot) - (Soldier) Father! Father David! (Soldier) Let's go! (Shouting and gunfire) (Gunfire continues) (Gunfire continues) Shit. Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! (Indistinct voices) (Woman screams) (Giggles) - I'm all right. - She's all right. - (Fulton) She's upset, that's all. - It's funny. We're all upset. She'll be all right when we leave here. She'll be all right. - How far you figure to Saunders' farm? - Couple miles, maybe. They can't have every inch covered. All those woods. There are ravines behind Saunders'. - If we can get through at all, it's there. - I think we better shake them. I'm telling you, that chick's out of her head. - Shut up, man. Listen. - What? (Helicopter rotors whirring) (David) Get down, man! Out of sight! Shit! He spotted us. Break through the woods. We're gonna break through the woods! If we get split up, we'll meet at Saunders' place. - We won't get away from that bird. - We can't sit here! (Man on speaker) 'Stop where you are. We have you spotted. 'Stop where you are or we'll be forced to open fire on you. Stop where you are. 'We have you spotted. We're in communication with the jeeps. 'We're in communication with the ground troops. You cannot escape. 'Stop where you are or we'll be forced to open fire.' (Gunshot) I'll try to keep the damn thing away so maybe we can duck it. (Gunfire) (Gunfire) (Machine-gun fire) (Gunfire) (Gunfire) (Machine-gun fire) Stay put! (Machine-gun fire) Burns! (Helicopter engine splutters) (Rotors stop whirring) Hey! I told you, Dave. - Hey, Dave! - You're forgetting about the infantry. - Let's go. - Huh? (Man) The crazies in here are detained, but they might not be infected. - Keep them isolated. - (Man #2) We're using the gymnasium. (Shouting and screaming) Take her blood pressure. I need a hand with this. (Indistinct muttering) (Doctor) Got a blood pressure yet? (Nurse) 24 over 67. (Doctor) All right, keep checking. (Muttering) Get it off of me! Get it off! Get it off of me! Get it off! He's arrested. Come on, let's go. Get another nurse over here, will you, please? These goddamn things! Don't you med guys have anything more powerful than this? No, sir. (Man on radio) 'Ally? I'm not getting any further on that formula.' - It's in the written records. - 'We can't read the microfilms manually. 'We're gonna have to wait until it's all in the computer.' Once it's all in the computer, we can have it in a matter of seconds. But it won't be all in the computer for three days! 'We'll have to try all the combinations. You gotta get a sample flown out to us.' - (Watts) Lots of luck. - 'Say again. Not reading you, Ally.' I said I'll see what I can do. Give me Peckem. (Man) 'To Colonel Peckem's headquarters. We'll have to have your voiceprint.' Christ's sake! He's only down the street from me. I just left him! 'We'll need to check it if it's to go through the network. 'We'll have to do a recording.' - You run this over to Peckem. - To Colonel Peckem, sir? Tell Peckem, without those samples, Dietrich might as well close down. If he refuses to send them out, have him call Dietrich himself and explain it. - But get him the hell off my back! - Yes, sir. I'll try. 'On that voiceprint, sir, will you state your name and I.D.?' Stick it up your big, fat, electronic ass! What's the matter? Ultraviolet's not infallible when you're working this closely. - So put your mask back on. - As you have discovered, Doctor, it's very difficult looking into a microscope when you're wearing a mask. Just how would you rate our chances, Doctor? - Family outside? - What? Do you have any family outside? - No, sir. - Hmm... - Me neither. - I'm sorry, sir. Would you marry me? Hmm? (Laughs) I assume from that answer that you rate our chances as good. No, next week. Of course right now! - That's army issue, Doctor! - All right, where is she? - Doctor Brookmyre's nurse, sir. - He sent her out with these! (Peckem) What happened, Major? Apparently, Dr. Brookmyre sent his nurse out with some antibiotics. - When was this? - Last night, just after things started. We recovered the materials, sir, when they were captured. There were several of them. At least there were. They got away last night in one of the vans. The van was found, but there was no sign of anyone. - This is army issue! Army issue! - Take Dr. Russell to the infirmary. This is army issue! There's no requisition! This is army issue! You know, if your nurse was exposed to any infected cases? Very briefly. We had the two children here. - Why in the hell did you send her out? - She's... She's pregnant. I was afraid for the child. I sent her with some antibiotic for the father. They're gonna be married. We're only doing what we have to do to ensure survival. - (Gunfire) - I got a message for Colonel Peckem! - Get in here, soldier. - I got a message... (Gunfire continues; shouting indistinctly) All right, keep down! Troopers will knock your block off! Goddamn it! Give me another man in here! Another guard! - Get me "C" Detachment! - (Gunfire continues) - (Man on radio) 'Your voiceprint, sir?' - Survival? (Panting heavily) What do you think, old buddy? There's four of 'em. That's four we can see. Must be more inside. Why don't we just scurry around and pass by 'em? It's almost dark. Let's wait. We need information. Why don't we just go down and talk to them? - Get her down! - I really would like to talk. Clank! (Gunshot) (Gunfire) - (Giggling) - Knock it off! (Gunshots) (Man) Got it! (Man #2) All right! - Hey, look at that! - Right on, man! - That dude can't shoot worth shit. - Yeah, missed you by a mile. You mother. (Indistinct chatter) Hey, you son of a bitch. - I ought to break your ass. - Hey, Clanker. - What the hell's the matter with you? - I'm sorry. I... - Thank you for going after her. - I was savin' my ass, not hers. Next time, I'm gonna throw her out there and you with her! That chick's crazy, man. She's got the bug. (♪ Old-time jazz playing) - What you figure on doing tonight? - Cleaning out this shit house. That's about all you can figure in this army. - I sure didn't figure on this. - Didn't figure on what? - This. - What? This, uh, maneuver. But what is it? Define it. Tell me what it's all about. I don't know, Sergeant. You never know what you're doing or why you're doing it. You just do it because you're told to. When are we moving out of here? What, you in a hurry? - Me? - Well, relax. You'll find this ploy somewhere in your manual, I'm sure. It's called "sit it out and let somebody else do the dirty work". Right on. Move slow and easy. Keep them from hollering. - Why take the risk? - We're doing this my way, you hear? Just get 'em down, keep 'em quiet. When we get inside, don't get trigger happy. - We gotta find out what they know. - Hey, man, I'm with you. I'll duck around over there. (Indistinct chatter) We're not gonna find anything out here. - That's right. - Thought I heard something. It's only a damn patrol. Make a noise and I'll kill you. - (David) How many men inside? - Three. You wouldn't be lying to me now, would you? (Soldier grunts) What's happened? I don't hear anything. Shh. - It's a long time. I don't hear anything. - Quiet. Go for your guns and it'll be the last thing you ever do. What's going on here? What are you doing to us? What army are you with? Why are you after us? I'm listening. Make it fast! - What do you know? - Nothing. - Now listen. You let me go... - Talk! OK. OK. It's a quarantine. There's a virus loose in the area. How'd the army get involved? How'd the army get involved in anything? I don't know! I don't know, man. Honest to God. It's a police action. - What are your orders? - Round up everybody into the high school. Everything was all right. People were coming in with us. They're treating them at the school. The ones with the virus, man, it's like they're crazy. - What kind of virus is it? - I don't know. The army only tells us what they have to. - It's in the water. - In the water? We're following orders. I mean, I know where you're at. This whole thing is like... (Gunfire) No! No more lies! Hey, David... Green Beret. What happened to you, man? That son of a bitch froze up. This croker is all mine. All three... All five of 'em. Hey, don't give me any of this Green Beret shit! I was just regular army. - David? - They're dead. They're all dead. My stuff. That son of a bitch, man. Slam... right against the wall. Hey, man, you really messed up. Man, I thought that dude knew Special Forces. I figured he's gotta be some kind of bad, right? Some kind of bad. You know I could never make it. Never even came close to making it. Regular army was all I ever was. Who turns out to be the baddest? (Bangs table) Single-handed, I got five of them son of a bitches! Hey, David! Why don't you put me in for a Congressional Medal of Honor? Hey! Hey! Where you going? - Uh...just going up to see Judy. - What? It's OK. I'm just going up to see Judy for a while. (Clanker) Oh, yeah... - I know what you mean. - It's OK. We'll be in the bedroom. - Yeah. - Hey! (Clank) My head feels funny. - Did I do something wrong? - You did what you had to do. - I didn't do anything wrong, did I? - No, it's all right, Clanker. - Huh? - You did what you had to do. OK. - (Sighs) I'll take first watch, OK? - Good. OK. I'll see you. She's all I have left. My wife is dead. Mae. That's my wife. She's been dead a couple of years now. Kathy's infected obviously. Artie's acting weird. Even old Clank's going, he's fighting, but he's losing. But not us. - God knows we've been exposed to it. - Well, I had that injection. Brookmyre said it wasn't an antidote, just a strong antibiotic. - Maybe that's enough. - You didn't have your shot. But I feel all right. David, it's... Honey, it's possible that you have a natural immunity to it. - We still have to go away. - Hey. We can make it. I know it. I haven't allowed her to date yet. I don't think she's old enough to date yet. The way these kids are today, it's disgusting. It's disgusting! These kids today, they're pigs! Not my little girl. No, sir. I'll never let her get into that kind of trouble. I owe that much to Mae. I'll never let her get into that kind of trouble. These kids today are pigs. (Phone rings) Well, we can't wait forever to break the story. I'm for going with the radiation scenario. The thing is, we can release it now, and it covers us for any eventuality. - But the onus on it. - Sure, it's embarrassing. But it's not as embarrassing as bioweaponry. At least everybody knows we've been using nuclear weapons. So we had an accident. We'll blame it on A.E.C. But how do we release it now before we know? We say there were nuclear weapons on the plane when it went down. If the perimeter doesn't hold, we're gonna have to go the whole way. We say there was a live weapon on the plane not destroyed when it went down. We got a team working on it. If we have to push the button, we just say the... weapon went off. For Christ's sake! We're talking about one of our own towns and 1,500 of our own troops. The town is already destroyed, and if they can't hold that perimeter, we're looking at the possibility of Trixie spreading across the entire country. You break that perimeter, then we gotta drop the bomb. Like immediately. God knows I hope we don't have to, but if we do, we gotta have some kind of explanation. I'm just being realistic. The radiation scenario covers us. (Man on radio) 'Vocom Central calling Mr. Brubaker.' This is Brubaker. 'We've completed your voiceprint check, and we have the president on the line. 'In a minute we'll hook you in.' - 'Mr. Brubaker, this is the president.' - Yes, Mr. President. 'Give me your consensus on the press release.' (Brubaker) Nothing unanimous, sir. But there is a majority in favor of the radiation scenario. - 'Safest, I suppose.' - Yes, sir. - 'The bombers still up?' - Round the clock, sir. Sixty thousand feet over Evans City. - 'Thank you, Mr. Brubaker.' - Sir? - 'Yes?' - We'd like to leave this line open, sir. If those perimeters break, we'll have to act immediately. And we'll, er... We'll need your permission, sir, to, uh... use the weapon. Uh, we want to leave the line open, sir, to, uh, avoid voiceprint delay. Sir? 'The line will remain open, Mr. Brubaker.' (Coughs) Mae? You still mad? I was only an hour late, hon. I thought of you all day. On the 15th hole. Ask Richard. He hit one 220 yards right down the middle. And I said, "This one is for Mae." (Wolf whistle) Oh. I used a putter on the 18th hole. Well, he said it was a foot. It was more like three feet. Think I would know that. Sure rolled in. (Clanging) You're safe, darling. (Moaning) Yeah! (Moaning) (Clank) You sick son of a bitch! Get up! Talk to me about pigs! What the hell were you doing? The pig was screwing his own kind. Let me go! Let me go! Don't do it, Clanker. - Just don't grab me like that, man. - OK, cool it. (Groaning and coughing) I'm cool, man... Let's get out of here. I used to think you had a brain, man. We should've left them two! - We gonna leave 'em? - Yeah. We'll leave 'em. (Clanker laughs) Now you're talkin'! (Laughs) Now you're talkin'. Let's get out of here. (Clanker continues laughing) Let's stay here. It's too late for you. I'm saying you're screwed. And we pull out with one bullet. You pigs! (Clanging) As much as you can fly in. - Now you keep them up there. - Sure they're not out or your range? Use what you have sparingly, but keep them up there. Running out of flares for the helicopters. We got another missing patrol, sir. Lost radio contact. I want a man posted every 25 yards on that outside perimeter. Yes, sir! Post another man every 25 yards on that outside perimeter. - We got the voiceprint on Watts, sir. - (Ryder) Right. I know. We'll reinforce you as soon as we can. Yeah. That's an order, soldier. I'm sorry, Doctor, but they won't authorize anything until we run a complete decontamination on you. (Watts) 'For Christ's sake!' (Peckem) 'We'll have the gear installed by tomorrow. 'We can get you out tomorrow night.' (Watts) Colonel, this information's invaluable. (Peckem) 'Can't you radio the data to Dietrich?' Every time I break this connection, I gotta go through this voiceprint bullshit! Look, I'm telling you. We've got a chance to crack it! Authorize me out of here! Screw the orders! Get me out of here! (Peckem) 'I'll have you out by tomorrow night. 'If I let you out now, they'd only stop you. That'd be a longer delay. 'This way we stay in touch and keep working. Sorry, it's the best I can do.' Hey, they're gone, man. That son of a bitch and his kid. (Judy) Oh, God. David. Get him down. Please get him down. Get him down. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. (Clank) Hey, man, look at this. Come on, Clanker. We gotta get out of here. Come on, buddy. Move it! (Soldier) Come on, girl. You gotta go in. Come on. We're taking everybody to the high school. (Whispers) Hello. Hello. What's your name? - My name is Kathy. - (Soldier) Stop it right there. - Hey, that's close enough. - Do you want to play? No. You stay away. Stay away, you guys! (Kathy) He said I could come out and play for a long time. - But I couldn't go far. - We're gonna have to shoot her. - I saw... - Stay away from her, man! Stay away! She's going insane anyway, man. Shoot her! Come on. I have four guns with me. Come on! - My father... My father doesn't... - (Confused chatter) - (Man) All right, everybody, shoot her! - (Gunfire) Oh... (Gunshot) - You was gonna leave me! - Stop it! Stop it! They're coming, David! David. David, they're coming, please. - Come on, Clanker. We gotta move. - (Helicopter overhead) Jesus, man. My head's screwed up. - I got the bug, right? - Come on! We gotta get out of here! No, man, I got the bug. Hey, come on! I'm sorry. I'm scared, man. I flip out and I can't control myself. - Come on, Clanker. Will you move? - Hey, big man... Big green hat. - Move it! - Tell me where I should meet you. - Tell me where I should meet you. - Clanker... Goddamn it, tell me where I should meet you! - I know. Meet you at the Zebra Club. - No, man, no. Listen. The Zebra Club outside of Bragg? I'll meet you there. - Out by the old concrete plant... - Meet you there and we'll drink... I'll take care of these guys. I'll meet you at the Zebra Club. OK? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, David. You got the brains, man. What are we gonna do? The goddamn bug. I got the goddamn bug! (Indistinct shouting) A crazy son of a bitch, ain't he? (Clank) Watch your asses, you chickenshits in those white suits! - (Soldier) Where the hell's he at? - (Muttering) Goddamn it! - (Muffled shouting) - There he is! (Shouting) Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Hold your fire until you can see him! (Muffled shouting) (Soldier #2) I'm staying right here. I'm not gonna move. - That son of a bitch can sure see us. - All right, let's move in slow! Fire! Fire! Fire! I can't see a thing. - Move in. Stick to your right. - Stay low, you guys. Stay low... (Sighs) (Leaves rustling) (Gun clicks) (Gun clicks) Looks like you're out of ammunition, man. - Son of a bitch! It won't work, right? - (Gun clicks) It's your ass, man. Just sit there and sweat it, man. We're gonna do us some drinkin'. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hold it. Am I going blind, or is this configuration smaller than it was? Hmm? Smaller? I don't know what it is you're looking for. I'm sure of it. What's the combination for this stuff? Uh, 44 and 23. Another slide, the same thing. A million to one we'd find it. But this is it. I'm sure of it. Goddamn it, this is it! - Give me Dietrich. - 'We'll have to check your...' I know, I know. The voiceprint. Are you recording? 'One minute, sir.' Come on, for Christ's sake. Well? 'Recording, sir.' Watts, Dr. Elston. Special unit 374-327. Code name: Trixie. Section: Research and Development. 'We have that, sir, and we'll put it right through.' Hustle, will you? It is bigger here! It's bigger than all the other individual samples. Goddamn it, woman, this is it. This is it! We gotta get this sample off to Dietrich. - I don't understand the significance... - (Watts) Just have faith. If you were to explain it to me, sir, I could be of more help. Get me Peckem. 'Your line is hooked into Central on that voiceprint check, sir.' I asked him for another line! 'We can cancel that, sir, and make this new...' Listen. When you get me Dietrich, put it through to me at Peckem's HQ? 'Yes, I think... Yes, sir, we can do that.' OK, then do it. I'm going over there right now. If anything comes, hold it. I'll be there in two minutes. This is very urgent. 'Yes, sir. Will do.' Watch those slides. Call me if anything different happens. Yes, but what am I looking for, sir? (Clamor of voices) - Hold it. - Wait. Listen to me! Will you listen to me? I'm Dr. Watts! I'm a scientist. I'm with the team. I've got a tube of Trixie here! - (Mutters) - Will you listen to me? I'm working on the virus! Will you listen to me? This is a mistake... Please, God, I will... They've got a voiceprint on me! I don't need a back-up! A mistake! Will you just let me go? (Screaming and shouting) (Gunfire) (Screaming) It's gotta be the perimeter. You gotta remember to do exactly what I tell you. - Promise, no matter what. - I promise, David. - Are you OK? - I'm fine. I'm ready. I'm fine, David, really. I want to rest somewhere. Now listen to me. They're gonna be coming through here. If they don't see us, they'll pass us by, and we'll be on the outside, huh? We'll be out. - How long will I be alone? - Not long. It's the only thing that scares me. Why can't you come in with me? I can't place the blocks from the inside. - David, where will you be? - I'll hide up in the tower. You're gonna hear them come through. They'll probably search the grounds. You just be real quiet until they pass by. - And I'll come back to get you. - They'll never find me. (Giggles) - They'll never... - They will never find us. Us? David, they might find you. No, no, I can hide. They'll never find either of us. - But what if they do? - They won't. They won't. Now listen to me. After you hear them pass, you be real quiet. And after they leave and they go far away, I'll come back to get you. If I don't come back to get you... ...you wait a long time, and then you leave by yourself. Oh, no. No, David. I can't go anywhere without you. - Now, don't worry. I'll...I'll meet you. - Where? - I'll meet you at, er... - The Zebra Club! - I remember, David. I remember. - Oh, no. No, not at the Zebra Club. I'll meet you at, uh... I'll meet you at your mother's house. Your mother's house in Danville. - That's a good idea. - OK, now if I don't come back... ...you leave by yourself and go to your mother's house. You take care of yourself, huh? Be quiet and don't move. That goes for both of you. - I love you, Judy. - What? - I love you. - David, I can't hear you. David, I can't hear you. I love you. David, what are we gonna call our baby? I think it's a boy. I'd like a boy. Our baby, David. (Indistinct voices) (Muffled shouting) I see your lights. All right. Give us an aerial flare. We gotta knock those blocks down. Good place to hide among those blocks. (Muffled chattering) (Indistinct chattering) Somebody check out the building. Two men, check out the building. Gotta work in pairs. (Muffled conversation) - (Soldier) Let's get out of here. - Better check up in the tower. (Soldier) Watch out for crazies! There's crazies in there! (Soldier #2) Shut up. - (Soldier) What's up? See something? - I don't know. (Soldier) Come on. Let's go. Come on! - Man, what the hell are you doing? - Hold on. I'm coming. Hey, you all right? Hey! Hey, what's the matter, buddy? Nothing. I'm coming down. Hey, man, it's scary enough around here. Why didn't you answer me? I'll be right there! I'm taking a piss! Aw, kiss my ass. Taking a piss? What the hell does that mean, "taking a piss"? - Hey, uh, how far out from Cairo? - (David) Don't know. Hey, come on. It's spooky around here. We'll never find the other guys if we don't leave now. Come on. - (David) All right, I'm coming down! - (Judy giggles) - (David) OK! - Hold it. Be quiet. There's something in there. Sounds like a little kid. Hey, it's a broad... - (Judy) David? - It's all right, baby, it's me. - David? - It's all right, baby. No! No! - It's all right! It's all right, Judy. - No! No! Judy, it's all right, it's me! Judy! Judy, it's me! - David? Oh, David. - (Distant voices) (Gunfire) - Hey, it's all right. We're not army! - (Gunfire) Stop! Hey, stop shooting! We're not army! - (Gunfire continues) - Please! We're not... (Gunfire) (Judy groans) Hey, Coach. I didn't know it was you. Hey, Coach, who's she? (Judy) David, it hurts. I know, baby. I know. He's kicking. He's kicking. No... he's just sleeping. (Soldier) All right, boy, let's go. Oh, hurry. You decide what you want to name him. I think... I think we'd better call him David. Judy? Judy? (Peckem) 'Right on the money as far as the census info is concerned. '3,613 total population.' 2,100 survivors. If you want to call them survivors. (Brubaker) 'Uh, I read you, Chris. That's a fine job. 'I hate to drop this on you, but, Chris, we're taking you out. - 'We're sending you into Louisville.' - Louisville? 'We don't want to hit the panic button, but we have reports of symptoms. 'We've always considered the possibility 'of Trixie being carried out before you got your lines up.' - (Mutters) - 'We doubt it, frankly, Chris, but, uh... 'We want you in there to check the situation over just in case. 'If it does break out, you'll be much better prepared, Chris. - 'You have one under your belt now.' - Yes, sir. 'You're the only one to send in there. 'The state police have blocked the roads and closed the airports. 'You're doing a great job. Hang in there. 'You've got transport arranged. 'You'll have to go through the medical before you leave the area. 'We don't want you carrying Trixie out.' No, sir. (Shouting and screaming) Put your hands on your head, Colonel, please. Breathe through your mouth. Colonel Peckem, sir, we can sign you out. - Hear anything from Dietrich? - They're sending a new man from Trixie. He should be here tomorrow. If we only knew what Watts was working on. Our boys have checked the slides he left in his microscope, but we can't make heads nor tails out of it. He was onto something. We'll dope it out... sooner or later. Hmm... sooner or later. Understand they found a rhesus monkey at Dietrich immune. Sooner or later, we'll find a human. Sooner or later. - Want an immunity check on this one? - Are you kidding me, soldier? (Man on radio) 'I see no way out.' (Man #2) 'There's never been a Trixie before.' (Indistinct radio conversation) (Man) 'I'm damn concerned! I don't know how you feel about it.' (Man #2) 'I simply said repeatedly...' (Man) 'Accusations and blame won't help anything.'
