Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. - Price, where's Asha? She's supposed to be here at two p.m. She's late! - [Price] She'll be here in two minutes. - Hey girl. - Hey. Girl, he is on a warpath 'cause you're late. - I'm sure he is, but so I don't give a damn today. He's too damn demanding. - Understood. - Is it wrong for me to wish death on someone? Like I wish he would get hit by a bus. Or at least fall out of a window to a slow and painful death. - Well, I think you better just get inside. - Send them in on my cue. London! - You're late. - I know, I know, but finding talent takes time. You're going to love these future stars. There's star power in all of them. - Like I said, you're late. I don't want to see them now. Tell them to go to another agency because of your tardiness. Punctuality is the true sign of seriousness. Obviously you're not serious. You can leave now, thank you. - Fine. May the very ground he walks on shatters and breaks and sends him straight to hell. - Girl, you crazy for real. (groans) - Hopin' drinking this water and cranberry juice is moving things along. I swear this is ridiculous. Pissing all over every five, 10 minutes is getting on my damn nerves. - I'm about to put on the show, give me the code. - You ain't playing with my shit. - Damn it, you're not supposed to swear! - Neither are you. - I won't tell mom if you let me use your tablet. Who are you texting? - No one. Lookin' at the b-ball schedule. We got a game on Monday. You think Dad might come? Probably not. - Yes he will, he always comes through for us. - You for real, girl? - Well, he always comes to my things. Maybe he just likes me better than he likes you. Haha! - Doubt it, is he coming to your little dance on Friday? Bet he don't. - I know he will. Call him, so you can feel shady when he says yes. Call him. (phone rings) - [London] Hey Will, what's up son? - Hey Dad, I got you on speaker so Kelis can ask you a question. Here she is. - Hey Daddy. - Hey baby girl, what's up? - Are you coming to my dance on Friday? It's a daddy-daughter winter dance. - [London] No, no I can't. - But Daddy, why not? It just won't be the same without you. - [London] No, yeah I know, I know, I can't. Yeah I have to work tonight. - [Kelis] Okay. - [London] Well definitely next time, okay? - Yeah. - All right. I love you sweetie. - All right Dad, talk to you whenever. - [London] Thanks son, take care, bye-bye. - Told you. Here. (emotional music) (jazz music) (humming along) (door creaks) - Hello hello. - Way. My lady of the night, lookin' like a million bucks! - Hello darling. - How you doing? - I'm wonderful. - Man it's good to see you. Hey mama. - Mm, so good, so good. - Yeah it's good to see you. Get this coat off. - Oh lovely. - Fo' sho'. - Oh, well you're in a good mood. - Have a seat. - We're having vodka? - Yeah. - All right. - Fo' sho'. So, I wanted to kind of talk about me and you. - Really? - Yeah, if that's cool. - Okay. - All right. Got some stuff for us, you know? - So what are we celebrating? - We are celebrating us. - [Chantal] Really? - Really. - Celebrating me, celebrating you. - To us. - Christmas time. (glasses clink) Mm-mm! It's good, right? - Are we having another straightaway? - [London] Straightaway. - Okay now you're starting to scare me a bit. - Why, what's wrong? - [Chantal] I don't know, we're having vodka all of a sudden. I mean come on, talk to me. What's on your mind? What's happening? - I been thinking about this. - [Chantal] Okay. - So I been thinking about us, I've been thinking about Christmas, you know? Christmas is three weeks away. - Mhmm, oh it's our third Christmas together. - That's what I'm saying, our third Christmas together. So look, I gave it a lot of thought. Was thinking about me and you, you know I ain't want to do it too close to Christmas. I was thinking maybe we could just, like chill. - Chill with what, what do you mean chill? - You know, just kind of pull back from a serious relationship and just, you know kick it, me and you. - Wait, come again? - Right so-- - I don't follow. - Christmas time, holidays, chill, kick back just-- - Okay stop talking, stop talking. Okay. - That's it. See that's what I'm talkin' 'bout. - Are you seriously doing this right now? What does that even mean, you want to take a step back? You want to go in reverse? - I was thinking you know, we could just cool things off for a little bit. - Why? Things are fine I thought! We were getting along, everything is great. Oh my god. You're doing this weeks before Christmas. What the hell, London? - That's why I didn't want to do it on the day. - What. So what, you're supposed to get some cool points for not doing it on Christmas? This makes no sense! We've been together for two years! - That was a good two years. That was a good two years. I mean it's over, Chantal. I figured that you would be woman enough to understand that. - So just like that, it's over? - Chantal, it is what it is. - Now I understand the vodka. We needed something stronger to toast to us. To us. - Come on now, why would you do that? Why would you... - You don't care how much you hurt people. I don't care about your bloody floor. You are the biggest asshole I know. - Go to bat on that. (hip hop music) Man, what the... (grunting) (toilet flushing) (crowd cheering) Come on, pressure, pressure! You gotta pressure the ball! - You know I enjoy spending time with you. - Thank you sweetie. Hey look, he gonna set the pit. Open shot, it's a shot! (crowd cheering) - Good game, good company-- - Man that's good company I know you two. Hey come on man, catch the ball man! - London, are you okay? - Alrighty, Mr. Mitchell. The doctor will be in shortly, okay? - Thank you. - You're so very welcome. - Have a good one. - You too. - [London] Sheeit, nursey nurse. - Mr. Mitchell. - What's goin' on doc? - How you doing? - Doing good, how are you doing? - I'm good. - You lookin' good, too. - Thank you. Your stitches look good. Your face will heal in no time. - Yeah I'm trying to get my handsomeness back, doc. You know, honey dips like me on full swag tilt, you know what I mean? - Mhmm, mmkay. Well, you know just don't sit in the front row of high school basketball games ever again. - You need to stop. - And stop talking trash! - You got jokes, huh? So messed up, doc. You got jokes, man. - Breathe in. Okay. Breathe in. All right. In all seriousness, your face will heal and the scar will be minimal, if there's one at all. - All right. - Other than your little basketball accident, have you been experiencing any other problems? Because you know I haven't seen you in over a year. - Yeah I know it's been a while, doc. No, I mean I'm fine doc. Everything's good. - Let me be the judge of that, okay? - Been having problems pissin', like it's been taking a while to come out. I don't know what's goin' on. It's like I'm nervous or something, you know? I don't know. - About urinating? - Yeah, just, I'm good, doc. - Okay well, slow down for a second okay? Let's think about your urination troubles. - All right. - Is there any burning? - No, no burning. - Okay, is there a thick purulent drainage coming from your penis? - You think I'm a ho doc, no! Dang. - Okay but while we're on the subject, let's talk about your sexual habits. - Please, let's do that. - Are you using condoms, or other forms of protection? - XLs on lock, whassup doc? - All right. - Hm. - [Doctor] Do you have to go more at night? - No, I'm good doc. - Any trouble with erections? - You want me to show you? You flirting with me, doc? - No. - You look good, doc. I'm sorry, okay. No I'm good, I'm good, I'm good doc. - Okay, 'cause you need to be vigilant about keeping yourself healthy. Especially now that you're what, 40? - 41. - Okay, well at 40, there are several tests you need to get. Think of it as a tune up for life. You know as a black male, there are diseases like prostate cancer that you can get at this age. - Psh, I ain't got no prostate cancer, come on doc, I'm good. I'm trying to tell ya I'm good. I don't have any of that stuff. - Okay, my job is to tell you what you need to know, not what you wanna hear. How about you come in and get some blood tests done, and some age appropriate screenings so we can get down to the bottom of why you're having difficulties urinating and just make sure there's nothing else going on. - You gonna drive me crazy with all these screenings. I don't have anything, doc. I'm good, telling you. Butter. - [Doctor] Okay look, I'm not trying to scare you. But I recommend you get the screenings just to be on the safe side. - What kinda procedures and screenings are you talking about? - If I tell you, will you still go? - It depends on what you gonna tell me. Just be straight up, what's up? - Okay, there are two tests. - Mhmm. - A PSA test, which will measure the level of PSA in your blood. - Mm, okay what's the other test? - Just requires me to stick my finger in your rectum to-- - Geez, you crazy. - Size of your prostate-- - Hell no! - [Doctor] And or-- - Don't even need to finish talking. You ain't even need to finish talking. You ain't sticking your finger in my ass. You stick my finger in your ass. - Mr. Mitchell, stop acting like that. This is your health we're talking about. - Whatever, doc. Talkin' stickin' fingers in people's asses? I ain't rollin' like that, I'm good. - Call over to the office and schedule an appointment with me next week, okay? - With you? - Yes. - All right, you said later tonight? - Next week, I'll see you next week. - Lunch. - [Doctor] Goodbye Mr. Mitchell. - Damn doc, shit! Doc, prostate, I ain't doin' that shit. (hip hop music) - So you're telling me that you missed your daughter's dance to go to some basketball game with some woman? - Let me see that? It's all over, it ain't like that damn. - You have no idea how much ass covering I had to do. Our children saw this, Kelis was crushed. Do you understand that? You're going to make this up to her. I'm telling you you're gonna make this up, and you're gonna make it up soon. Do you understand what I'm saying? What the hell happened to your face? That's what you get, dummy. That is exactly what you get. - You act like Kelis is the only person that's affected by this. - Kelis is the main one affected. Who in the hell else would be affected by this? - Hell else you think? - Oh, that exotical you were dating? 'Cause it ain't me. The exotical? - She's black and when she finds out, it's not like this is gonna help any. (laughs) - This is gettin' funnier by the moment. Your karma is gonna catch up with you, do you understand me? It's catching up. - Are you done? 'Cause I gotta go meditate, yo. - What did you say? - I said I gotta go meditate. - You have to meditate? - Yeah. - [Mercedes] When'd you start that? - I have to go to the hospital. Get a screening for cancer. - Cancer? Why, mhmm, cancer? - Yeah. - You are up to your tricks again. You know what, did you really think I was gonna fall for that? - Why would I, ah. You on one tonight. Why would I be playing games? Why would I be playing games with something like that? - You been playing games for the last 10 years. Come on, come on, and who's getting screwed? It's us, it's your children, it's us. You need to get your damn life in order. Make your children a priority. I am so sick of this. - Never mind, talkin' like a mother... Hey I mean are you done or I mean-- - [Mercedes] Am I done? Are you done? - With what, talking to you yeah I'm done, believe me, trust, I'm done. - You're done? You're an asshole. - So be it. Goodnight. Lock the door. Thank you. (phone rings) - [Chantal] Hello? - Hey how you doin', it's me. - [Chantal] What do you want? - Dang, I was just calling to see how you were doing. Have you been online? You see anything about a basketball game? - [Chantal] A basketball game? Are you serious? - Yeah. - [Chantal] You broke up with me two days ago, now you want to talk about some damn basketball game? (dial tone beeps) (phone rings) - Hey, what's happening baby girl, how you doing? - [Kelis] Hey Daddy, just calling to see how you're doing. - I'm just sittin' here, got a little down time, what's up? - [Kelis] Mom said you had an accident and messed up your face. - Yeah, I did. - [Kelis] Was it like a car accident? 'Cause Will is acting like you got your face all jacked up at a basketball game. You wouldn't ditch a dance with me for a basketball game. - No no no, sweetie. I would never do anything like that. Yeah, it was an accident so my face is messed up sweetie. - [Kelis] I thought so. - Maybe when I'm feelin' better, you and I are gonna go do something really big. It's gonna be fun. How's that sound? - [Kelis] Yeah. Daddy I gotta go, okay? - Okay, all right. I'll talk to you later. - [Kelis] Bye Daddy, I love you. - I love you too, all right bye. (emotional music) Yes, how are you? I would like to schedule an appointment with Dr. Hampton please. As soon as possible will probably be best. Yep. All right, thank you very much. All right, have a good one. (jazz music) Hey, Chantal, how you doing? - I see your face was messed up. - Yeah, I was in an accident. - If you want to call being hit in the face with a basketball an accident, then yeah. - Okay. I guess there's no denying it then, huh? - Not at all. I can't believe you. You went to a basketball game with another woman one day after breaking up with me. Who does that? - So are you gonna chill or are you gonna let me explain? - How can you? - I didn't want to cheat on you, so I broke up with you. I love being with you-- - Oh stop it, stop it. Don't give me that I love you BS. You don't love anyone but yourself. Now I'm wondering if the last two years were a joke to you. - Come on. - Oh stop it, no get off, stop it, get off of me. Answer me this. Did I ever mean anything to you? - Of course you meant something to me. Why would you say that? - Such a liar. - Oh you're... - Is this the same way you treated your ex-wife? - Okay do me a favor, no no leave her name out of your mouth all right? That's a whole different situation. - [Chantal] You should just die for the way you lie and treat people. - Know what, you want me to tell you the truth? - Oh that would be great, please, oh my god yes. Please, tell me the truth! - I broke up with you because I need to focus on my health. (laughs) - You know that's really quite brilliant, really. (clapping) Is that the best you've got? You focus on your health by going to a basketball game with another woman one day after breaking up with me, really? Well let me ask you, do you feel healthy? Did it work? - I went to the game just to see her brother play, okay? But I'm dealing with some things, and I'm focusing on my health. My doctor wants me to go take a screening for prostate cancer. - Oh please, just stop it! You're in perfect health, this makes no sense! - Obviously I'm not, otherwise I wouldn't have to go for the screening. I'm dealing with this on my own, okay? I didn't want to tell you 'cause I don't know how you gonna deal with it. - Oh so you're serious? - [London] Why would I be joking about something like that? - Oh my god. I'm so sorry, well why didn't you think I'd be able to take it? - I mean-- - You have to give me a little more credit than that. You definitely could have leaned on me. - I understand, I just didn't know what to do. - Now I feel like such an asshole. - Well-- - You've been dealing with this on your own? - Of course I have been. - Darling I'm so sorry. I just love you so much. (jazz music) - Love you too. - Why wouldn't you tell me this? - It's just a lot going on right now. Let me get the door, I'll be right back. - Okay. - Hey. - How's my baby doing? I'm so sorry for everything-- - I'm sorry, did she just say baby? - Oh, hello. - Goodbye. - Hey look okay, wait a minute. Wait-- - No first you lie to me about needing a screening for prostate cancer, and then you have her show up! - Who said I was lying? Look, I didn't even know she was gonna, I didn't know-- - Stay the hell out of my life, and die! - Come on, so you just gonna leave? Just like that? - Just like that. (growls) - Wait, prostate cancer? - I'm sorry. - And who was that? - Look, just never mind. So why are you here? - I came to check on you, but if you're gonna be like that. - Oh I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just, as you can see I'm going through a lot, and I don't, this company, I can't just do this right now, please. - [Deni] So you want me to go? - I don't want you to go, but I don't know what else to tell you. Right now it's probably best, yes. - Wow, so this is how you treat me huh? - No, come on. Deni, why you acting like-- - This is how you treat me? - No, no, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Save it. - I'm sorry! Damn! (somber music) Oh man, come on. - Going somewhere? - Yeah I'm going home, doc. I can't do this. - Sit down. Your face is healing fine. That's one less thing to worry about. - Yeah, but then you're replacing it with all these tests, and procedures, and putting your finger in my ass. - Don't be like that. But I just want to run some tests. So today, you're gonna do the PSA test. - Why are we doing that one though? - I wanna wait for the results of that test to come back before doing the DRE test. - Okay, long as we're not doing that other one. I ain't ready for that one, you know what I'm saying? - You don't have to worry. I'll be gentle when I stick my finger in your rectum. (chuckles) - I'm gonna be gentle stickin' mine up yours too. How 'bout that? - Lighten up some. - Doc, look I don't like no things in my ass. I ain't that type of man. - Most of the men that I know aren't, but back to the test. Now, if your PSA levels come back anywhere between four to 10 milliliters, then you'll have to come back to do the DRE test. - Doc, you might as well just shoot me up. I'm telling ya I don't have what you think I got, you know? I'm good, we're not taking that other test. I'll tell you what, though. Test come back negative, me and you we going on a date. I like that, let's knock it out, let's go come on, doc. - No wait wait, hold on. I thought you were afraid of being stuck up in the rectum. - Look at it like this, something up my ass, brick house date? I'll take that brick house date all day long. Plus I don't have time to be coming back and forth wasting everybody's time, come on. Let's do this, doc, I'm ready. - All right. - All right. - Put this on open in the back. - Open in the back. - I'll be back. - You sure you don't want me to open it in the front? Aight. (knocking) Come in! Pants down, cheeks out. This is ready, I'm ready, let's go. - You're so silly. (plucky music) I'm just kidding. - Stop playing, girl. (plucky music) - All right, Mr. Mitchell. I'm gonna need you to lay down on your side. All right? Just like that. And I need you to try to relax, okay. - [London] Yeah. - All right on one, two. (grunts) - All right, come on doc, hurry up. - I'm almost finished. - What the hell is all that humming? What are you doing back there? Come on, what is going on? Say somethin' doc! Shit, hurry yo ass up. - All right. Well, the good news is that there aren't any lumps or masses. But there was an area that was a little more firm than I would expect. - That's 'cause you got those gloves on. - Look, it's good that you're willing to take the PSA test today. Let's just take it one step at a time, okay? - My ass is hurtin'. - [Doctor] You did good. Get dressed, I'll be back. (sighs) (emotional music) - La-dee-dah, la-dee-dah. Little Christmas mama. - You're crazy. You know what? Let me tell you something that somebody once told me. - [London] What's that? - You can't just be poppin' up over to people's house, boundaries girl. - Well I'm not a girl, so that doesn't apply to me. - Oh, what do you want? Why are you here? - [London] Came to see the kids. - Oh, that's a good one. - No I'm serious, I really did come to see the kids. Where are they? - They're here. Kelis might be the only one wanting to see you, though. Will ain't dealin' with yo mess these days. - I can understand that, I'm not surprised. - I'm gonna yell at them to come down. - All right, whoa whoa whoa, one sec though. I need to talk to you first, if you don't mind. - [Mercedes] Okay, well you can talk and not touch. - I can't hold your hand now? - No, you can talk. You don't have to touch. - I ended up taking that screening. - The cancer screening, why? - Just to appease my doctor. Let 'em know nothing's wrong with me. - Okay so why is your doctor so concerned if everything's fine? - Been peeing funny lately. - You're a grown man, and you don't know how to urinate? - This is serious, yeah. - Why are you bringing this up? 'Cause you want me to help you smooth things over with the kids, right? You know you broke it. You're gonna have to fix that. - I figured since you were the mother of my children, you'd be concerned. - Aha. - Yeah. - Yeah, okay well think again. Whatever goes on in your life is no concern of mine. You know you actually said that when you walked out, you remember that? - No I don't. - Yeah you did, and I just hope your insurance is up to date. I mean you just keep coming over here, keep coming over here talking about this cancer stuff, looking for sympathy. You gotta be looking for sympathy. I don't know why you keep bringing that up. - Not looking for sympathy. - Why why-- - Mom! Will doesn't wanna help us. - Oh baby. - Daddy! - Hey baby girl, how you doing? Oh you all right? You good? Right on, right on. - What you doin' here? - Came to see you guys, spend some time. - Psh, why? You ain't done that in forever. - Yeah I know, Will, but I thought maybe things could change. Hey maybe we could put up a Christmas tree, huh? - Yeah! - Yeah? All right, aww. - What's up with your face? - Will, you know Daddy was in an accident. - Yeah, well that's not what's online. - What? - It was an accident, baby. - Right. No stories online about a basketball game? - [Mercedes] Hey you guys, let's put up the tree. Will, help your mommy get the tree okay? - Never mind. - [Kelis] He's so moody, ugh! - Maybe I should go talk to him. - Yeah, what you gonna say? - I'm gonna tell him how crazy you are about me. I can tell you have a problem with me. Would you be so kind as to tell me why? - Dad you ain't never around. Don't talk to us unless we call you. Now you want to come over here and put up a tree? Been gone some more with that. - I work, son. I think you know that. - Last four or five years? When you walked out on Mom, you left us too. Now you lyin' about stuff like your face. You doing it to Kelis? Forget lying to me, but to her? Man, that's low. - No matter what you do, no matter what I do, I'm still your father. So I would advise you to put some respect in your voice when you're talkin' to me. - Oh yes sir. I promise never to be a liar like you, sir. Better? - All right Will, come on. Come get this tree outta this basement. (somber music) - He hates me. - Do you blame him? You're never around. What is it gonna take for you to be a real father, huh? Death? (somber music) - You wanted to see me. - So how was your flight? Last time I checked we were in the same building on the same floor. I mean, what are you doing? What takes you so long to get here? - Working, you? - I'm waiting for you to bring me the rest of the clients! - I brought you three and you turned 'em down. - So what, your work's just done now? You're finished? - For you, pretty much. Another agent loved them. - Asha, you know what? You better stop playing okay? I got you here to bring me, me talent, not someone else. - You know what? Never mind, I'm so frustrated with you right now. Are we finished? - Does it look like we're finished? Do I have clients on my desk? Hell no, we're not finished. I'm waiting for you to bring me some superstars, like drop me some clients in here tomorrow, like pronto, like snap-snap quick! Come on! - That's it, the hell I will. Look, I've been biting my tongue for the past six months, but not anymore. You are an asshole, Mr. London Mitchell. Yeah I said it. You run up and down here barking orders at everyone like we're just here to serve your pompous ass. Do I look like a dog? You throw out talent left and right like they are never good enough for you. Who the hell do you think you are? And now you're looking like I'm boring you. You are so mean. Look, I'm the only person in this place tall enough to stand up to you. To hell with you, London. I was so happy when that basketball knocked you out. (phone rings) - Hello. Yeah, how you doin' doc? Give me one second. Okay, poof, be gone. - Unbelievable. - Get the hell out. So what's up doc, how you doin' man? - [Doctor] Your test results have come in. - Yeah, I'm good like I told you I was, right? - [Doctor] Actually, your STD results were negative. However, your PSA levels were abnormally high and I'm concerned about that. - Well I mean, so what's that mean? What's the results of the other test? You had your finger all up in my ass. - I did, and I was concerned. I want you to see a specialist, Dr. McArthur. He's gonna provide further testing to determine if you have cancer or not. London, are you still there? - Yeah, yeah I'm here man. - [Doctor] I'll get a referral written up for you to pick up today. London, you need to take care of this ASAP. - Whatever doc, no problem man. Yeah, all right bye. I got cancer, where in the hell I get cancer from? Stupid damn doctors. What the hell they talkin' about? (emotional music) (doorbell rings) Come on, man! (plucky music) (knocking) Shit, man. Hey, Mercedes! Will! Yo Mercedes, Kelis! Yo Will. Where's everybody at, nobody home? Hey, come on what are you doing? - What are you doing? - You didn't hear me? - No, what the hell are you doing? Trying to scare me, what? - Come on, you got the shower on. You're wasting water. How come you not naked? - I swear something's wrong with you. - I mean you do look good naked, right? - How did you get in here? - I got in the house because the key's under the doormat. When are you gonna stop leaving keys under the doormat? - Yeah you're right, okay go home. Go, go-- - Now I need to talk to you. Seriously, I need to talk to you. You're the only person that I can lean on right now. - London, go home. Let me take my shower in peace. - Mercedes, I might have cancer. - Let me take my shower in peace, London go home seriously! - I might have cancer, did you hear me? - All right, go in the kitchen and get some water. Okay, let me get myself together. (emotional music) - Dr. Hampton, she called me and she said that she wants me to see a specialist. Run a new series of tests on me. - Okay, I don't understand. How do you go from having issues going to the bathroom to having cancer? - She said that my PSA levels were higher than she expected, and things in my ass felt strange and weird to her, and now this, you know? I was trying to be cavalier about this whole thing, but... - Have you, really? Bringing it up to get sympathy. - It wasn't bringing it up for sympathy. Things are real now, Mercedes. I went from having pain problems to pissing issues. - Okay, what pain, what are you talking about? - I was having pain in my legs, but I didn't know, I didn't think it was anything. I just, I didn't really think much of it. I thought it was 'cause I was getting older and you know you get older, you try new things. I was trying new sex positions and-- - Oh okay, that's too much information. - Mercedes, we're talking about cancer. Just saying the word, I mean... Dunno how I'm gonna get through this. Can't seem to wrap my head around it. I mean am I dying, am I gonna die from this? - Look, you can't talk like that. - What if I die from this? - You can't talk like that! It's just too early. I mean, maybe they caught it early okay? You have to stay positive. - Mercedes, you've never heard me say nothing like this before. I'm scared. It's like I'm in this crazy twisted nightmare. - All right, you have to relax, just stop for a minute okay? - What are we gonna do? I mean, what are we gonna tell the kids? - We're not gonna tell the kids anything yet. Didn't they tell you to call a specialist? Have you done that yet? - No I ain't seeing no specialist. I don't know if I wanna do that. - [Mercedes] You don't know what? What do you mean? - If I do that, then that means everything that I'm feeling is real! Everything! - Boy everything is real right now. You're gonna get that referral, call the specialist, make that appointment and see the doctor, okay? You have to do it for yourself and you have to do it for our kids. - What are you talkin' 'bout for the kids? You see my son? He hates me right now. That's probably from the stuff that you tell him behind my back! - Here we go again! You are something else! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I don't know what to do right now. Look I know that you my ex-wife. I know I haven't been good. I know I haven't been the best person lately, but right now I need somebody. I need somebody to help push me through this. - All right-- - I'm afraid to tackle this by myself. - All right, you're not by yourself. I'm gonna be here, okay? - Mercy, I need your help right now. - I'm here. (gentle guitar music) Okay? - Thank you, man. - I'm here. - Thank you. (gentle guitar music) - [Receptionist] Thank you for holding, how can I help you? - Uh yes, I would like to schedule an appointment with Dr. McArthur please. - [Receptionist] All right. We'll see you Thursday. - All right, thank you. (emotional music) (urine tinkling) (groaning) - Oh my god. (emotional music) - Hey Mom, what you up to? - Hey baby. Lookin' at our beautiful Christmas tree. We did a great job as a family decorating, didn't we? - Yeah. - Your dad is coming over. - For what? - To take Kelis skating. - Is that how he's gonna make up for missing her dance? What do I get for him missing my games? - Look, I know you have your issues with him, okay? - Don't you? - Of course I do. But he's your dad, cut him some slack. - He lied. He got his face busted by a basketball and told Kelis he was in an accident. - Well I mean, he kinda was in an accident. - [Will] You too? - Look, I haven't forgot, okay, what he's done to this family. I know. But he's your father, and he's trying. At least let him try. - I don't want to. Where he been at the last three or four years? Away, he should stay away forever. - Take that back. - What? - Take that back! - Fine. - Look I know you have your issues with your dad, but I don't want you ever wishing death on him, do you understand me? - I didn't! I just want him out of our lives for good. - That's the same difference. - Why you always on me about him? The same dude that left us. Now you want to protect him? You think he deserves that? When you had to be both parents because he decided he didn't wanna do it no more? - It wasn't like that, do you understand? You don't know the deal between us. I'm gonna tell you one more time, you be nice and respectful to your dad. Do you understand me? You only have one. And besides, it's the holidays! Can you get with the Christmas spirit? - He needs to leave us the hell alone. (knocking) - [London] Come in. - Hey. - Hey. - Hi. - How you guys doing? - How you doing, thanks. - Good to see ya. - Hi. - All right. So, Mr. Mitchell. Since Dr. Hampton was a little concerned about your previous results, I'm gonna suggest you get a biopsy. - What's that? - Well it's where we take samples of the prostate, and we examine those samples under a microscope to check for cancer cells. - Oh my god man, does that hurt? - No, you might experience some discomfort, but we can numb the area if you're more comfortable with that. (exhales deeply) - How long does this take, man? - About 10, 15 minutes. And it'll take about one to three days to get the results back in. - Yeah, okay. I gotta take anything for this? - Yes, I'll write a prescription for some antibiotics that you need to start taking today, and after the biopsy just to reduce any risk of infection or things like that. - Okay. - All right, listen. The sooner you get the biopsy, sooner we get the results and we'll either ease your mind or we'll take the next step toward treatment, right? Sound good? - Whatever, just do it. - All right, it's a good decision man. - All right, thanks. - Thank you doctor. - [Doctor] You got it. - It's gonna be okay. (pleasant music) - You are not gonna believe this. - Well London, from you getting hit in the face with a basketball, to possibly having cancer. I don't know what I wouldn't believe when it comes to you. - Well, senor me has bought a Christmas tree. - What? - And Christmas decorations. - You're not even a Christmasy type of guy. - I know, I know, I was just kinda lying at my place and I was thinking to myself like, I want a Christmas tree. Yeah, dunno maybe this whole diagnosis thing is gettin' to me. - You have not been diagnosed yet. - I get that, but I'm trying to prepare myself for the worst. Anyway, that's not what I wanna talk about. I was thinking maybe you and the kids could come over and help me set up. What you think? - Help you set up? - Yeah. - You mean you sit on the couch and delegate? - That's it. - For us to put everything-- - You know I'mma be watching you 'cause you look good. Put you up on that tree. - Oh, would really be the ornament. - Exactly. - Well, you know your daughter, Kelis, she's game for that stuff, but Will takes after you, so. - Yeah I know. - I don't know. - I kind of brought that on myself, though so. So I'm good. Another day. Parents gonna be coming over for the holidays. - Are they? - Yeah. - Nice. - It'll be a good ol' Christmas for the cancer guy huh? - Stop that! Seriously. - All right I'm sorry. Geez oh man. You look good when you feisty, girl. (laughing) - You're crazy. I'm sorry, too. Yeah that was it. - Whoa! You apologizing over here? - Got a little bandage on your face. - Well thank you, I appreciate that. You know I been thinking 'bout how I've been. I haven't been the best of guys, so just maybe this whole diagnosis is like, like karma you know? - Maybe the basketball to the face, you know. But you need to stop, come on really? You have two feet in the grave, it's really freakin' me out. - I mean, you talkin' 'bout you're freaked out? How do you think I feel? I got hit in the face with the basketball, then I hit the bleachers, then I got a finger up my ass, then I might have cancer. I mean, what else am I supposed to think? - You're supposed to be positive and optimistic. - I am, I'm positive. - Oh somebody's coming, okay act normal. - Okay act normal, stop, don't touch me. - Mom. - Hey. - Hey honey, you're home. - What's up baby girl? - Daddy! - Now I've seen it all. - Gettin' big, girl. - We were just talking and having snacks. - Yeah, that's all. - Again, why? - Why not? - [Mercedes] I thought you had practice. - Got canceled. - So how you been doing at practice? I mean you shaking and baking? You crossing 'em up, you hittin' threes? What you doin' dog, huh? - Why don't you google it? - Had to ruin it. - That's the bravado, you the man now. Is that my sweater? Probably goin' through my closet. - What's up with him? - [Mercedes] He's just a little moody. - He's always in a bad mood now. - He's weird like most high school boys. Daddy, you staying for dinner? - Yeah, I'mma stay for dinner. I heard you say something about some boys. You not slick, but yeah I'm definitely-- - Uh, yeah thanks baby girl. I guess so. - Yay! - [Mercedes] Don't you have some homework? - Um, um, can't we make like some arrangements? - No no. - Homework. Goodbye. Golly that girl is gettin' big. - She is. - Shew! Wish I could get through to Will, though. I don't know what's up with him, man. He hates me, he's so angry all the time. - Well, I talked to him the other day and he probably forgot. - Yeah, maybe he forgot. I tell you what, that boy's something else. - It's gonna take some time. - I may not have time. (emotional music) (phone rings) Hello. - [Doctor] Mr. Mitchell, it's Dr. McArthur. - Hey, what's up doc? Lay it on me, do I have cancer? - [Doctor] Well, I'd rather talk to you in person. I'm gonna need you to come in tomorrow if you can so we can look over a few things. - Can't you just tell me over the phone, doc? - [Doctor] Not over the phone. Can I see you tomorrow? - Yeah, yeah, what time? - [Doctor] I can set the appointment for 10:25 a.m. - All right, 10:25 it is. Man, if they can't tell you over the phone, that's not good. Hey Mercedes, how are you? What are you doing tomorrow, 10:25 a.m.? - Look. Whatever he says, it's gonna be okay. - Yeah. (knocking) - Morning. - What's up doc? Do I have cancer or not? - Just right into it, huh? - [London] No time to be messing around. Do I have cancer or not? - Well, I did get a look at your results for your biopsy. - Okay and, what does it say? - There's a good chance that you could have a more advanced stage of cancer based on these initial tests. - And what, what? - We need to run a PET scan to determine if and where the cancer's spread throughout the body, and if it has spread, if it has spread we could be looking at stage four. - Cancer, what you talkin' about? Telling me I got cancer, that's for old people. - No no no no-- - He told me I got cancer. What is he talkin', he's lying. - No he's trying to help you. - How is he trying to help me? How are you trying, how is he trying to help me? - He's trying to help you! - He's not trying to help me! - Mr. Mitchell. - Tellin' these lies man. - I wish that were the case, but there's something there and we need to further examine it. Now, as I see it you do have cancer and it's very serious. - No, no you need to stay-- - Why, for what? He's lying to me-- - He's trying to help you! He's trying to help you! - How is he helping me? - He's helping you! - He ain't got my damn test, he got somebody else's test. - [Mercedes] Stay, come here! Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. (emotional music) You gotta go back in and get the treatment, please. (emotional music) - Mercy. I don't want to lose you. Am I dying? - Please. (sobbing) - I don't wanna die. - You have to go back in there. - I don't wanna go back. - Listen, we have to listen to the doctor okay? You have to get this biopsy. You have to. - I don't want to! - You have to go back in. Do it for the kids! You have to go back in. Can you do it for me? - Mercy, I... I don't want to lose you. - Go back in. Please. - Don't want to. - Please, please. - Aight. - Please. - All right. (sniffling) - I know this is a hard pill to swallow, okay I do. But I promise you my team's gonna do everything they can to help you beat this thing, right? - Okay. - Now, just so we're sure, I think we should do an MRI, all right? When your results come in, we can start talking about immediate treatment options. Yeah, I'm sorry you went through this. I'm sorry you're going through it, but at least you caught it now so something can be done. That's a good thing, okay? I'm gonna give you guys a couple minutes okay? - Thank you. (emotional music) You shouldn't be drinking that. (sighs) - You're right, I probably should be slitting my wrists. - You shouldn't be doing that either. (sighs) - So when are we gonna tell the kids? - Can we at least wait 'til after Christmas? - Why would we wait 'til after Christmas? If we go with the treatment the doctor's talking about, my hair's gonna be falling out, I'm gonna be sick as hell. Why would we do that? - Do you wanna ruin their Christmas? Do you like, they'll be destroyed. Can we just wait until after Christmas? - Man. (sighs) This cancer thing, man. Never thought it would be cancer. Feel like I'm gonna break down again like a little bitch, you know? - It's a lot to deal with. We're gonna get through it, though. - Feel like God is punishing me. - Why do you feel like that? - Lied to Kelis about the dance. Broke up with Chantal to go date somebody else, all the stuff I'm putting you and the kids through. - You haven't been the best guy, but you're not the worst guy. He's not punishing you with cancer. (sighs) - Still gotta tell my parents. All the stuff I gotta do at work. Still gotta tell the doctor what treatment I'm gonna decide on. Maybe just telling me to slow down. What are you doing tomorrow? Can you go with me tomorrow? - I can move some stuff around. I'll be there. I'll be there for you. - I appreciate all the things you're doing for me. - I'm not going anywhere. And maybe you can slow down a little bit. (giggles) - You might just get some tonight. - I might just let you get some. (giggling) - Thanks babe. (emotional music) - Why are you always eatin' cereal? - Because I love it, problem? - Whatever. - Speaking of problems, why you got one with Daddy? - He's just full of it, girl. - You're such a liar. - He is. Look, you're young. You're a girl. You think he's the greatest guy ever. - He is. - Kelis, he got his face busted by a basketball. - That's still an accident. - And why'd he tell you he couldn't come to your little dance thing? - He had a work thing. - He don't work at basketball games. - A basketball game? - He was on the internet and everything. Look it up. - Okay, next subject. - No, you wanna know why I can't stand him? I'mma tell you. - Next subject! Dad's been coming around a lot lately. What you say about that? - It's weird. I don't get why Mom's being so nice to him lately, after all the things he did to you. To your family. Couldn't be me. (door beeping) - Go look who that is. Let's go and listen to what they say. - [Mercedes] Look, I don't want you to overthink things, all right? It's not definite. - Don't wanna overthink anything, but it is what it is. (sighs) - I don't even know what to say. - Yeah, have to rethink my whole life. - Look, I don't want you to worry too much all right? - I'm not worried, Mercedes. - We still have to wait for the results, nothing's sure yet. - The results aren't gonna tell me anything I don't already know. I have prostate cancer. There's nothing I can do about that. Thought of how we're gonna tell the kids. - Oh my god. - What? (sighing) Hey sweetheart. Come over here. - You have cancer? - We didn't want you all to find out like this, son. - We didn't know you guys were home, sorry. - How long have y'all known? - Son, it'd probably be best if you'd just come and sit and we talk, all right? - Look, it's still the early part of this process okay? - I wanna... Look I wanna be straight with you guys. I'm gonna be all right mama, okay? It's gonna be all right. Son, I'm not gonna lie to you man. I've been seeing my doctor and he thought I should see a specialist. He ran some tests, and I have prostate cancer. Just waiting to see if it's, might be stage four. - Oh my god. - That's bad, right? - It ain't good. - Look you guys, your dad got a PET scan the other day, and we're still waiting for details and information. - If we hadn't found out today, would y'all even told us? Hello? - Look, I would've told you guys. We were just waiting for the biopsy so we get more clarity, and we were able to let you know the results. - What you gonna do while waiting for the results? - Well I'm gonna live life. Look I got a tree and I got decorations at the house. Your grandparents are gonna come over, they're gonna help out. I was hoping you guys could come and help out, huh? - Do they know? - No, they don't know yet. I wanted to kind of keep everything festive, you know? It's Christmas time. I don't wanna cloud it with my problems. Want us to decorate, spend some time together. If you guys let me, huh? Look I know this is a lot to take in, guys. I don't know what else to say. Why don't we go to the movies, huh? Why don't we go to dinner? Why don't we do something, get our minds off all of this? - I think we should do that another night, you know? Let it sink in. - That's fine. - They'll let you know when they're ready. - Sounds good, sweetie. I love you guys. - Love you too Dad. - I love you too. - Make it through this. Things are gonna be all right. - It's gonna be all right. - You guys can't get rid of me that easily. I'mma be all right, right? Good morning Miss Price. - Oh, good morning Mr. Mitchell. - How are you? - I'm good, thanks. - Good, good. Has Asha arrived? - No, not yet. - All right, do me a favor. Once she gets in, let me know. I'd like to speak to both of you in my office. - Me, both? - Both. - Okay. - Okay. - All right. - Good morning. - Hey, good morning. We are wanted in London's office. - What the hell does he want? - Girl, I do not know. He just said he needed to see both of us in his office. - I beg your, if this man is trying to fire me today I'm kickin' ass and takin' names. - Okay. - Let's get this over with. - Okay. Wait, don't you think we should announce ourselves? - I am. - You, oh. - Ladies. - What do you want? - Wow, you're actually on time, love it. Miss Feisty Asha, always. That's what I love about you. Thank you for coming. I know we have a busy day at the office. There's something that I want to tell you that needs to remain between us for now. - Sounds serious. - It's definitely not easy to say, that's for sure. I need to take some time off. - Why, because it's Christmas? - Christmas, holidays, yeah. I really wish it was about the holidays. I have cancer. - Whoa. - What? - Why me, you know? Probably gonna start treatment right after Christmas. Gonna take some time off, and I won't be back for quite some time. - Well I am really sorry to hear this. - Yeah? - Yeah, me too. Cancer! - Big C, that's me. - I imagine your family knows. - Ex-wife knows, kids know. Haven't told my parents. I don't think I'm ready for that just yet. Let them enjoy the holidays and, yeah. I'm gonna need you ladies to hold down the fort. Gonna need you to take care of things here. Especially you, Asha. - What? Yeah, I'll do whatever it takes. - Yeah. Gonna be leaning on you a lot, your expertise, your direction this company should go in. You're an amazing person. You're gonna be fine. - Wow, thank you. - I know you're gonna be fine. Miss Price. You are a sweetheart. I haven't been the best boss. I've been selfish. Haven't always been the best to you. And I'm sorry. - I don't know what to say, but I really hope you get better. It sounds so weird even saying that. - Yeah it is weird, it's weird. I'm not gonna hold you. Thank you for everything. - Okay. - All right. - Head back. - Yeah, me too. - Asha, I would like to speak with you please. - Yes. - I need to apologize to you. - What? Do you even know how to apologize? - Yeah, I know how to apologize. I need to apologize for what is it that you call me? For being an asshole. You're an amazing person. A great employee. - Wow, I agree, thank you. Why do you have to be so damn demanding all the time? I'm sorry, I don't want to yell at you. - It's fine. I've just got prostate cancer. I'm not an invalid. I can take a little yelling, hell I deserve it. Cursed me out the other day, remember that? That's when I got the call. - Oh my goodness. - Yeah. That's when I said damn, why me? Why me? I wanted to apologize to you. Because you will be the one running this company. - Me? - Yes you, you deserve it. You worked hard for it. Anything you need from me, I'm here. Regardless of how I feel. What's going on in my life. I'm only a phone call away. - Thank you, I can do that. Anything else? - Talk more. When it's all said and done, thank you. - Look, I know we've had our ups and downs, but I want you to know I do respect you, and what you've done with this agency. You are a fighter, London. You will beat this. I expect to see you back bigger and better. I'm not taking no for an answer. - Thank you. I'll be back. - Yes, you will. (emotional music) - Hey Chantal, how are you? Yeah I was wondering if I could see you sometime soon? - [Chantal] Heh, when? - Whenever you've got a moment, that would be great. As soon as possible, sooner the better. - [Chantal] Fine, I'll come over after work. - Thanks, I appreciate it, bye. Thank you for coming last minute. I appreciate it. - No problem, what's up London? I have things to do, people to see. - I know you're mad, and I'm sorry. I just wanted to call you over and I didn't, I didn't treat you right. I did you wrong. You're beautiful, you're a great woman, and some man's really gonna appreciate you one day. But, I really don't know what I was thinking. I really don't, and I wanted to tell you that face to face. - Thank you, for the apology London. - You're welcome. - I've been praying for you, and I hope you get better. - Well thank you, I really appreciate that. - You're welcome. And I will continue to pray for you. You're gonna be fine. - Thank you. Oh man, I appreciate you girl. (pleasant music) Glad you guys came past. It was a nice surprise. Why does your mother always wanna be so fancy? Why can't she just eat chips out of the bag? - As you know, she loves that. - Always crazy. - So how you been? - All right, man. I could be doing better, but trying to keep cool until these test results come back. - Yeah. - Yeah. - When is that? - I don't know, they said any day now. See what I got in here. Ah, here we go. - Hey Mom's gonna love that. - You know your mother, I see. Lime green bowl. Put some chips in there for her, man. Think I'm just gonna eat mine the regular way. - Me too. - Mm. Hey look son, I'm sorry man. - Really? - Yeah, I, I'm sorry for leaving you and your sister all those years ago. - Where were you? - Just being immature. Didn't know how to handle being a divorced father. Look man, after I divorced your mother I was just... - Yeah, you left her. - No but you're right, after I left. Yeah, after I left all of y'all huh? I just wanted to be out there, man. Running free. I didn't wanna be no father. I know that's a horrible thing to say, but it's the truth. I don't wanna hurt you and Kelis anymore, so I am going to be a better father. - Is this just 'cause you have cancer? - No it's 'cause I need to be a man, learn how to handle my responsibilities. Don't want you walkin' around hatin' me. - I don't hate you, I just don't get how you could walk away from us. - You know in life we make choices sometimes, good or bad, but I tell you what, I'm walking toward you and Kelis now, if you allow me. - It's a start. - All right. Let's go get these decorations going, man. Grab those chips. We got your chips, baby. (emotional music) (laughing, chatting) - I mean you slip on the carrot! You're supposed to slip on a banana. Doesn't anybody get to crack some jokes around here? (emotional music) - Man, you look absolutely amazing. - Thank you. So what's up? (sighs) - Last time we talked, it wasn't good. - You think? You had another woman come over, all the while making me think you had a cancer scare. Who does that? - Yeah. Really sorry about that. I need to apologize. I treated you bad, and I've treated you like dirt. I broke up with you three weeks before Christmas. I really have nothing else to say, but I'm sorry. I was hoping you could forgive me and accept my apology. - I guess I could try to forgive you. - I really appreciate that. - Thank you for apologizing. - You're welcome. - Wow, you've really had your place decorated. It's nice. - Yeah, had the kids come over and help with decorations, make everything festive so they did a good job. - That's sweet. So what are the next steps? Do you want to work this out? What do you want to do, you want to get back together? - Chantal, I don't think this is gonna work. - [Chantal] Why not? - I'm fighting for my life. I have cancer. - What? - Yeah. The screening, it wasn't a lie. I'm holding on as best I can. - Oh honey, what do you need? How can I be there for you? Oh my god. What do you need? - Chantal, at this point I'm getting a lot of support from my wife, my ex-wife and my kids. - Your ex-wife. Oh, okay. - I didn't mean it like that. I mean, Chantal she's been there for me since I found out. - No I get it, I understand. - I called you over here 'cause I didn't want to hurt you anymore. I just wanted to tell you sorry face to face. - I'm sorry too. But I do hope things work out for you in the end, you know? The whole cancer thing. - So you're hurt now? - No, I'm good. I'll be okay. Thank you for apologizing. Now you can go through your treatment with a clear conscience. I'll be out of your way. - Chantal, come on. (emotional music) - I really do hope things work out for you, London. I'll be praying for you. - Thanks, Chantal. - You're welcome. (emotional music) - Ugh man. Hey doc. Yeah, I'll be there, okay. (emotional music) Mercedes, how you doing sweetie? Yeah I need you to be there for me one more time, if that's okay. - [Mercedes] I got you, all right? I'll be there. - Okay bye. (emotional music) I'm so out of it, Mom. Feel like I just messed up my whole life. I'm scared. Like I'm scared, Mom. - Son, you're gonna be okay, trust me. And you will conquer this cancer. - I feel better that you're here now, but... I never ask for much. But it would really help if you'd pray for me and pray with me. - Sure, sure come on. (emotional music) Father God, we kneel before you and we say thank you. Thank you Father for everything you've done, and have yet to do. Father, forgive us for any sins we may have committed knowingly and unknowingly. God it is through your power that we're created. Father God we call on you right now in a special way. God, every breath we take, every morning we wake, every moment of every hour we live through your power. Father God, I call, I call on you and I ask you to touch my son. The crown of his head, to the soles of his feet with that same power. Father God, fill him with that power. Cast out anything that should not be in his body. Mend what is broken. Root out anything unproductive. Father God, please, please Father. Open up any blocked arteries and veins. Oh God, remove all inflammation. Cleanse him from any infection, Father. Let your healing love and mercy pass through his body right now, Father God. Let it function in the way that you created it to function, Father. God, let your loving, warm spirit Father fill him. Pass through his body right now, Father God, so that he will be healed and function in the way that he is supposed to function, Father. Restore him to full health. Mind, body, and spirit so that he will follow you all the days of his natural life. Dear God, I ask all of these things in Christ Jesus' name, and we pray, we say amen. - Amen. - It's gonna be okay, son. You're gonna be fine, okay? You're gonna be fine. Don't worry, you'll be fine. You'll be fine. (emotional music) - Look, whatever he says, whatever happens I'm here. I'm not going anywhere. - Thank you, I appreciate it. I really do. (knocking) - Hey hey. - Hey doc. How you doing? - I'm okay. So, the team reviewed your PET scan, and now we know what stage cancer we're dealing with. - Really? Just give it to me straight doc, what? - Hold on, that's why we do a series of tests, okay so we can have multiple scans and samples, and Mr. Mitchell I got to tell you, after all the tests, you do not have stage four cancer. Actually, it's in the early stages. Stage one, at the worst early stage two. - Oh my god, really? - Yeah really, but you still need to go through treatment. - Totally fine with that, I can do that. - Okay good. We recommend you do seed implant therapy. - What's that? - Well okay, it's a procedure where radioactive seeds are implanted into the prostate, and the number of seeds and the placement of those seeds will be determined based on your cancer. The implants will deliver a high dose of radiation to the prostate with limited damage to other bodily tissue, so. - Now I wanna do something more holistic, but I mean that sounds a little complicated, doc. - Yeah it does, but the procedure takes maybe two hours tops, right? You'll be able to go the same day with the treatment you need with minimal side effects. This is a good thing. (laughing) I tell you what, I'm gonna get some reading material. I want you guys to get read up and be well informed on all this before you leave, okay? Okay. - Thanks doc. - Thanks doc. - Does it feel good? - Thank you man. - Me too, it's good news, okay. All right, I'll see you guys in a few minutes, all right. (sighs) - Man, I never thought I'd be so happy to hear stage one. God. - You know what? You're still crazy. - Still crazy about you. So, I wanted to do something holistic. I don't know about this seeds therapy thing. I mean what do you think I should do? - I think you need to, we're going to do the research, right? And whatever's best, we'll do that. We're gonna read what's best for you. - All right. - And I'll be there. - Sounds good. (emotional music) You know sweetie, you really have been great to me this whole time. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. - You're welcome, you know I love you hm? - Reminds me why I fell in love with you all those years ago. - Yeah, and you still love me. - Oh I still love you more than I did first day I met you. (emotional music) (pleasant hip hop music) - I wonder what I got. (pleasant hip hop music) It's a board game! (pleasant hip hop music) (laughing) I got another candle. (laughing) Thank you. (pleasant hip hop music) Give her something good. (laughing) - If we could please hold hands and bow our heads. God is good and definitely great. We thank you for this food, and the nourishment of our bodies. In God's name we pray, amen. - [All] Amen. (laughing) - Oh that way. - Right on, baby. - Give me a little bit of yours. (people chattering) - Bring it down here. Is that biscuits or what? (laughing) - Pop love a dinner roll. - Oh yeah.
