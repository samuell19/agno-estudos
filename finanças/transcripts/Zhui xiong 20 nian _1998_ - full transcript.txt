Mom, I'm back. Mom, I'm back. Mom, the phone is ringing. Mom, don't be mad with me, please answer the phone. Mom! 20 years after. Yes. Go ahead... number 48, Sai Yeung Choi Street, yes... Homicide Bureau. Madam. This morning at 8:10, the keeper called to remind them to check out. The girl answered the phone, she said they needed one more hour. Around 9:30, the keeper called again, but the phone was busy. The keeper opened the door and saw the woman lying there, she was dead. The body hasn't been moved, we are waiting for the coroner. The man was trying to do the gastric lavage for himself in the toilet. He is half dead, but I think he will make it. Now, he is in the hospital. Any suicide notes left by the couple? No. Did you ask the keeper... Before the couple took the room, has the room been tidied up or not? Sure they did. I bet you seldom come to this kind of places, right, Madam? Madam. Write it down, she drank a lot of Wine. Yes, Madam! Photograph her shoes. Yes, Madam! Who coroner for the job? Eric, he is on his way. Can't wait anymore! Remove her clothes and shoes. Can you hear me? Are you shy? Po, is the man ready to make a statement? Sure! I think he can give us a statement. Go to the hospital and charge him with murder. Murder? What is the motive? I don't know, you'd better ask him. Good morning. Good morning, pretty angel! Doing my job again? You know I am the coroner, don't you? Officer Lau. We've received Po's fax. He is on line two. We've received your fax about the suspect's statement. Please explain to us. The man was almost scared to death. Then, he cried terribly. This is the story: the woman wanted to break up with him. But that jerk threatened her with a tape they recorded their intercourse. He is always forcing the victim to go to bed with him. The woman told him this would be the last time. The jerk didn't let her go, he intended to put on a suicide. Actually, he mixed beer with arsenic to poison the woman to death. Well done! But there are many spelling mistakes in your statement. That's it. Joyce, please explain the details to us. Point one, the man was able to crawl to the toilet but didn't report to the police at once. Point two, there is no suicide notes found. Three, if they really wanted to commit joint suicide, they didn't need to wear a condom to make love. And there wasn't any sperm left inside the woman's body. Causes for suspicious. You are well aware of using condoms for making love! Go on. This is an abominable offence. After making love with the victim, he coerced her to drink the poison. Since the proportion is too much, the dead felt ringing in the ears and thirsty within a minute. She suffered a great stomach pain, her heart stopped supplying blood. And she wasn't able to resist. When she died, she must be naked, at most, she was wearing underwears. Since the murderer has strong desire for the dead, maybe, you can term it affection. So he dressed her up, even did her shoe-laces. Shoe-laces? The murdered did the shoe-laces for her, the way of fastening up is just reversed. Lau, charge him now. Yes, Sir! The lotion smells good! Which brand is it? Report to me before taking any action, OK? Why are you working so hard? Do you want to take over my seat. Yes, I want to take over your seat. But I'll sit in my own chair. You need to be nourished by a man, you look dry today. Madam, Madam... We're all going to dinner and afterwards to karaoke. To celebrate our job well done! We'll pay and you are our guest. If you don't go, that means you are not giving me face. It's a good idea, enjoy yourselves tonight. I'm busy tonight, I can't join you. Madam. This is the mother of the victim, she called to report the murder. The dead is named Chiu May-ling, 26 years old. A full time secretary in day time and moonlighted as a secretary too. She lived alone, her neighbours said... she was a nice girl. She didn't have a nightlife, no boyfriend. So, her death wouldn't be caused by any loving disputes. Nothing valuable lost at home. It was not a robbery. Haven't you eaten yet? Madam. Everybody out! Before the coroner's arrival, no one is allowed to enter. How long ago did she die? The body's is slightly warn... not more than 2 hours. Has she been sexually assaulted? Sure! See the swelled pussy! Any ejaculation? Not sure! I can tell after checking it out. From the obvious wound, it must be caused by serious struggles. Her eyes and hands were bounded by tape. Found the weapons yet? Not yet. Turn the body. Why? The murderer brought his too box. And packed up everything before leaving, it's just like an on-call services. The cut starts from the vagina and ends at the abdomen. The murderer should have used a thin and sharp instrument. Probably a knife, at least 8 inches long. She died from losing too much blood. Or... Maybe, she was strangled to death. Or, she might have been injected with chemicals. Eric. Open her mouth, check whether her tongue is still here. Her tongue was cut. Mark it down please. The murderer is between the age of 40 to 55, male. A criminal who has great organizing skills. Calm, patient, calculative and smart. Superficially, he is harmless. He is communicative and highly intuitive. He may not know the victim. But he is able to convince the victim to let him in. Through the whole murder, he attains great satisfaction. The murderer is very confident, he likes to challenge the cops. To prove he can flee from punishment, he will likely call us... or return to the scene. Chu, contact the telephone company to trace all in-coming calls. Paul, question the residents of this building... to check on all strangers. Po, leave 2 guys here... to keep an eye on any suspicious person. I don't understand! You mean, this is not the first time he committed such crime? The murderer killed a woman the same way 20 years ago. Check every inch of this place. If the murderer left a hair here, I want you to find it. Damn it! Can you make it? That's him! I've got it! It's registered under Lee Chi-chiu, 43 years old, the address is ground floor, no.8 Tin Liu Village, Sai Kung. Let's go. Paul, standby. Ready. Search every inch of it. Yes, Madam. I am sorry. What's the matter? Nothing, I was just bitten by a gekko. Where is Stick? I will never understand... this guy's mind. I saw him loitering, at first, I didn't pay much notice to him. Later, I noticed him always starring at the flat of the victim. I think, everyone would be scared by his fascinating expression. So I went forward to check his identity card. He might not know you've already found his address. So he reported his phone number and address to me. Then, I showed him the picture of the victim. He stared at the picture and sneered. So, I took him and taught him a good lesson. He admitted to everything. He confessed to putting the victim's tongue in his refrigerator. We've found 4 tongues. There were at least three more victims. But, madam... I am sure he isn't the one you have been looking for. He is too young to kill and rape 20 years ago. I've studied your file, the house you are living... belongs to Lee Chi-chiu, but he died five years ago. He was your father. Whose scapegoat are you? I won't answer anything before seeing my lawyer. Did anyone teach you to do that? Who is he? I won't answer anything before seeing my lawyer. Stick, leave us alone please. Yes, Madam. Actually, I want to understand your motive. But I am sure you won't say before your lawyer is here. Why not let me answer for you. You're 23 years old, you have two occupations. During the day, you work as a delivery boy in a courier company. At night, you work as a security guard. You live alone, so you feel lonely, don't you? You have professional knowledge about medicine and anatomy. Learned everything from medical books. That proves that you are smart and patient. I am quite sure that, you had an unhappy childhood. You parents abused you. Even sexual abuse. That's why you fear sex. You gain sexual stimulation through violence. To kill a woman who is defenseless. You abused her, tortured her, then raped the corpse. In order to be sexually excited. But, under normal condition, you're impotent. Well, if I ask whether you are impotent, I don't think you need to answer before seeing your lawyer. You think you mom died unjustly? What do you know? You were an orphan when you were five. You became a superintendent at 28, in charge of the Homicide Bureau. In the last 20 years, you have studied criminology. So, I am quite certain to assume that, to you, the human body is just a pile of dismembered limbs and bloody fluids. You refuse to get close to other people. So I am sure that, you are sexually frigid. Maybe, you are still a virgin. Stick, take it in. You can choose not to talk, but you should eat anyway. Feed him five times a day, until he is willing to talk. You said there's still another murderer, if you want us to believe it, you better get proofs first. If we let this report go public, it'll arouse panic. The murderer will appear again to commit another crime. It's our duty to warn the public. I don't want to hear the unfounded suspicions. Joyce, tell me your plan. To start a psychological warfare, to make the murderer show up. Good speech! You don't have to be responsible for any mess caused! That's Why you can talk heroically. Officer Wong, you can start now. Yes, sir. Sir, this is important, reporters can wait. It's not necessary. Joyce, give me one good reason. Lau, do you have a mirror? Thank you. Give me the file please. Maybe, Sam will buy your point. I know it's the murderer who... killed my mother years ago. What is the motive of the killer? The case is now being investigated, we cannot disclose further details. If you have any more questions, Officer Wong Wing-nin of the Police Public Relation Bureau... will try his best to give you answers. Officer Cheung, Joyce's mother was the victim killed 20 years ago. Well, you'll handle this place. The police presume that Lee Chun-ming is not the only murderer, 20 years ago, a similar case happened, the modus operandi was similar to this case. So we believe that, this is continuation of the crime. The murderers are of the same kind. They are disable, self-abased and are born losers. They wanted to be excited from raping, but they are impotent. They are only able to hurt women who are comparatively weak. We believe that, there is one more criminal on the loose. The police department is now requesting citizen's... If you put me in the dark again, I'll make sure you pay for it. But I am really curious, you work so hard in office, will you work as hard in bed too? Officer Lau, I am sorry, your car is blocking my way. Please ask someone to move it. I am pissing, and there is no one around. I'll come down when I'm done. But, I want to see your face, when you're making love. I have a detailed record on Lee Chun-ming. We found ID. cards of his grand-parents. Be serious... He is an orphan, he doesn't have any close friends. His neighbours said, he is a loner. And, one more thing. He was taken to the police station some years ago, he was supposed to be charged with indecent assault, but he was released soon. Not formally charged? But at least it's recorded. Only noted on the on-duty record. But we don't know the date. Now, we have to check it day by day. We have been working hard on it. Keep on checking, I want all details. Got you, pretty angel. Today is a good day to die. What's the matter with you? Do you miss him? He knows something very important, but he didn't tell me. He tried so hard to hide from you! Think! He swallowed a piece of blade. It takes great courage to bite one's tongue off to kill oneself. He bit his tongue off, it cramped because of great pain. Half a tongue was left and he choked, he couldn't breathe... and he suffocated to death. Is that right? Did I say something wrong? We don't know who she is! She hasn't said a word. The psychiatrist said, she might be held imprisoned for an extended... causing schizophrenia. She doesn't trust others and doesn't know how to communicate. She is under the bed, she doesn't want to come out. The doctor said, this is a kind of habit. She feels safer being locked up. I don't know her at all. Yes, it's weird. She has your picture, with your phone number at the back. Hello! My name is Joyce Chan Ching-yee, What's your name? Why do you have my picture? Isn't it funny? No! I just want to get her out from the bed. I can see you! I don't know her. I'll take the picture with me. No problem. Po. Get me the files of all the missing girls in the last 15 years. Wait, let me write it down. OK, go ahead. Where and when were they last seen, I want to know everything. May I speak to Cheung Sze-mei? Wrong number. So you haven't discovered out May's identity. I am really disappointed. Who are you? May has been with me for 12 years. She is not used to the world outside. You'd take good care of her, got it? I don't have any preference for any of you girls, I love you as much as I do May. Do you love me? How? Remember that day? You were playing with your friends in the playground. Your mom came to take your home. She scolded at you, and you cried. My heart was aching, just like being stabbed. So I taught her a lesson. I didn't ejaculate when I raped her. So, I am not your foe, but I am your savior, you should thank me. Well, when are you free to have a tea with me? You naughty girl! I saw you making fun of me in the news report. Do you want to make me angry? It's useless. Promise me, try hard to stop me. Otherwise I'll treat you the way I treated your mom. At that time, you will be naked and begging me for mercy. They shared the same blood type, and they look alike. On June 30, 1985, on her way to school, Cheung Sze-mei was abducted. Until now, she was recorded missing. This morning, we tried to contact her parents, but the address and the phone numbers were all changed. After all these years, we don't know Where they are. Sir, I suggest you form a special team for this case. Right! Joyce, I'd like you to heard the team. Let's start from this person, Cheung Sze-mei. Give me a progress report every morning, any questions? I won't start with Cheung Sze-mei. Reason? We want to catch the murderer, we are the hunters, not the target. The murderer is calm and cunning. He set Cheung Sze-mei free intentionally as bait. He is playing a game with us. He is setting a trap. Cheung Sze-mei won't give us any clues. Do you have any other ideas? Don't over presume. Any clue is clue, is that right? Are you Joyce? Hi, this is Jeremy. Hi. I am a chlld psychologist. How is she? No special progress. I've done some test with her. She can't focus. But she loves drawing. What kind of pictures does she draw? Just scribbles. Madam, this is from Po. Can I show it to her? May has been with me for 12 years, she is not used to the world outside. You'd take good care of her, got it? To you all... Uncle, I dare not do it again. Don't panic, it's fake. Look at this! Who is she? It's you! Girl, time to eat now. Let's go out first. Joyce, I know you graduated from London University, Actually, I am your junior. You were famous in school. You were the first Chinese who got a first class honour. I want to take her away, she is an important witness. Well, should we start from this nuts? No. She is the victim, not the suspect. I want to protect her. Sit down. Sit. You will live her temporarily, until we find your parents. Just make yourself at home. I'll get you some clothes. Help yourself. I don't know how. From now on, I'll call you May. You can can me Joyce, or Ching-yee. Whichever you like. Put it on. You should wear it. It'll protect you! Wear it. If you are tired, you can take a nap first. I don't know what happened to you. And I don't know whether you understand me or not. From now on, you must live normally. It means... you should change your clothes yourself, sleep in a bed. Understand? I am sorry, I need the overnight kind. OK. See is this OK? We'll leave soon, after paying first. Thank you. Thanks. May May... May May... What are you doing? I need to piss. You should hang on! You are a human being, not a dog, you can't piss anywhere. I am sorry, I can't stand it. Forget it! It's alright. Let's go home, OK? Go play. Come in. Madam, I've bought everything you ordered. Please put the bags inside, thank you. Madam, I am sorry, Nancy has given birth to many babies. Can you adopt them? OK. We can start now. Up till now, we know three things. First, the murderer killed my mom 20 years ago. Second, the murderer imprisoned May for 13 years. And he let her out intentionally. Third, Lee Chun-ming used the same method to kill 4 victims. Point number one and three are dead end streets. We may be able to trace something from point number two. You told me to check the files of all the missing girls, now, only 12 files are useful. Madam, you suspect the murderer detained more than just May? I don't know. But if we question the families similar to May's, may be we will find more clues. May May, don't get too close to the TV. Po, tomorrow, question the families of the missing girls. See if you can find out anything useful. I want you to take shifts to watch May. Madam, I can't. That day, I was hanging clothes, I looked down to the street, and I saw a man dragging my daughter away. I rushed outside, I cried for help while I was chasing after them. After running for a While, the man left my daughter behind. He then fled away. 2 days later, my daughter disappeared, I haven't seen her since then. Can you recognise the man? I did a picture in the station. Who is he? He is my husband, forget about him. Since that incident, he lost it, he always says someone is coming to take us. He always blames himself of being late to pick up our daughter. Mrs. Wing, do you still remember the suspect's face? No way! It happened a decade ago! Be frank, even if you find my daughter, I don't know whether she is my daughter or not. Thank you, we are leaving now. Shame on you! Wear your trousers! I leave May to you, how can you leave her to those bastards? What's wrong with you? Get up! Madam is back. It's Uncle. Uncle? Is that Uncle Po? What are you doing here? Uncle said, he would like to play hide and seek with me. Where is uncle? He is behind you. Do you really want to see my face? Your body is just like what I've imagined. Your puberty came later than other girls. You had your period when you turned 16. And these started to swell up late. Your hair grew late. I warned you not to play tennis. See! One of your arms is thicker. So? Have you slept well lately. You know how much I love you! Have you guessed who I am? Well, uncle has to punish you then. She is really lucky. If the cut was a little bit deeper, she'd have died. Thank you. How is May? Let's go back to the station for a meeting. Put all your guns on the table. The murderer is amongst us. Inside this room, everyone is possible suspect. Paul, when Chu was killed, where were you? I was taking a statement with a suspect at the station. The suspect can be my witness. I was riding bicycle with my girlfriend in Tai Po. I went with you to Wing's home. After we parted ways at Wing's home, Where did you go? Where? I swear, I am not that jerk! If I am lying, get me run over by a car. Where did you go? I went to a prostitute. I was at Portland Street. What is the name of the hooker? "Big Boob"! I don't know her real name! If you don't trust me, you can go to her place with me. OK! I trust you! May saw you before. I was just kidding. What's your name? Joyce Chan Ching-yee. Where do you live? 150, Yea-fan Court, 27 Kennedy Road. How old are you? Measurements? Family? None! I am orphan, my parents died when I was young. Why? My father died when I was three. My mom was murdered when I was five. And then? I was sent to the orphanage. What's your relationship with the killer? He killed my mom. What else? He couldn't have known so many things about you! I don't know. You said he is someone around you, maybe he is your friend. I don't have any friends. Your rival? Someone you offended. Impossible. You lover? Your past lover? Tell me, who have you fallen in love with? I fell in love with a married man. He migrated to Canada three years ago. Forget about him, he is not the killer. He dumped me. Go on, I must know him. Any one you secretly admired before? Any one secretly admired you? Someone secretly admired me, but I didn't admire anyone. Who is he? You! If you go asking these nonsense, you'd better get out. I want to know who he is, I have no time. When did you learn to play tennis? During F.1 and F.2. Who was your coach? An Italian priest. A psycho priest? He died in a car accident in Canada half year ago. Someone around you. Someone who watched you growing up. People at the orphanage. Watch man, social worker, staffs... I know, he must be a benefactor. Senior, do you want a rest? A sponsor. A sponsor? Can you figure it out? A few uncles. When you were in puberty, who was your close friend? There was an uncle. When I felt unhappy, I would write to him. Then, he would write back to encourage me. He told me not to play tennis, he said I would ruin my skin. Luckily the orphanage... cooperated with us. These 29 men... were all your sponsors. I usually called them uncles, I don't know their names. Do you remember the address? Kennedy Town! Let's check it out. Kennedy Town... You remember Uncle's face, don't you? Can you recognise the man in the picture? He is Uncle. Madam, Officer Cheung is home. We have tailed from Tsim Sha Tsui till home. We watched him pick up two young girls. I think they are underaged girls. Joyce, Why are you all here? What are you doing? Cheung Chi-chuen, you're suspected of conducting illegal intercourse with underaged girls. And you are suspected in a homicide case. I don't know the girls are underaged. I didn't kill. But we have a witness. Do you dare to be formally recognised by our witness? Don't panic, tell me who is your uncle. Turn on the light please. Uncle... Uncle... Take her away. Uncle... Be good, stay calm! She has pointed out number two. You are still feeding the fishes! They will die if you feed them too much. Brush your teeth, take a bath and then sleep! Go. Tomorrow, your parents will come to pick you up. You'd look bright to see your parents. I don't like you! Don't be cocky! You know how to answer back now! But you'll suffer later. You have to work and make your own living just like everyone else. You'll fall in love, your heart will be broken, you'll get married. I'm very afraid, I'm not educated, I haven't gone out. I don't know how to cross the road, I haven't taken a bus. I have no friends. I don't know many many things! No exactly! You are quite smart. You can draw, and you can feed my goldfishes. Silly girl, everyone is afraid of something. Me too. Let me tell you a secret. Your figure is much better than mine, you have better skin. You are more lovely than I am. Really? You are more lovely, but I am more beautiful. Don't be silly, you are not longer a kid. Come to visit me if you are free. Go to bed. Uncle, I've done what you told me. Please don't kill my parents. Be good, uncle loves you! May, don't draw anymore. You parents are on the way, tidy up now. Sorry, we are late. This is Superintendent Chan. Mr. And Mrs. Cheung, parents of May. How are you? How are you? May, do you still remember mother? Mom. May. The breakthrough came when... Cut! Madam, please stare at the camera with a red light on, OK? Again! OK. Sandy, fix her collar, her bandage is shown. Thank you. Want some water? No, thanks. Well, let's have another take. 3,2,1, start. The breakthrough came when... Cut! Drink some water first. Offer Wong. This is my daughter, Ying Ying. Say hello to auntie. Auntie. Good girl. This is Ying Ying's mother, Kathy. Hello, how are you? Hello. She is one of the best on our force, Miss Joyce Chan Ching-yee. Don't panic, go slow, just relax. I know. Do you want a ride? Well, thanks, it's your family day, I shan't interrupt. That's right. I'll ask someone to send the tape to you. Where do you live? I... Well, I'll ask them to send it to your office. We are leaving, bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Would you walk? OK? Isn't Hawaii a good place for a trip? Why do you want to take a long trip there? Of course, I would like to stay in a place Where you are not around. Remember to buy us souvenirs. Sure, each of you will get one souvenirs. I'll buy a special one for you. That's love! It's hard to choose a proper one for you. Cause the souvenir for you must be very small. Will she joke will you? Will she? What are you doing? She's on leave, but not you! Don't you have work? Come to my room for a meeting now. You said you would ask your fellow to send me this tape, didn't you? If I tell you this is just an excuse to see you, will you let me come in? Really? You'd better think carefully. The door is wide opened. Want some tea? Fine! This house is almost the same as I've imagined. What do you mean? Boring? Happy birthday. What? Anything would do! Just an excuse. Thank you. Let me open the bottle of Wine. Great! When will your vacation end? Around three weeks. How is it? What is next? Anyway, I won't get married, no one is proposing to me. Thank you. Why don't you eat? Oh no! I can't stand watching myself on T.V. When I drew in Africa, inspiration suddenly appeared and drove me to finish this drawing. I am in my own world. Why do so many girls love reading the "Little Prince"? Will they always cry when they read? I am not that sensitive. Would you let me see you cry? You're drunk. No... Not yet, so I decided to... have one more glass, come on! I would like to quote a corny line. "Life is... Absurd." Cheers! I won't deny that I like you. But, aren't we going too fast? Right! We'd better slow down. What's up? Take them all. This is the records of Lee Chun-ming's case. And, we have the picture of the kidnaper. Answer the phone! Answer now! Uncle, you promised that you won't kill my parents. Don't lie to me. May? May, is that you? May! You've reached Joyce's mail-box. Please leave a message after the beep tone. Madam, I am bringing something important to you. Wong Wing-nin wrote the statement for Lee Chun-ming many years ago. Driver, please speed up! Hurry please. Joyce, please give me a towel. Didn't you hear me? Have you called me? Did you answer my call? No... We've just made love, so Why are you lying to me. Have you forgotten how much you just needed me? You lost! I caught you first. One, two... Don't kill me! Don't kill me! Everyone knows now, it's useless to kill me. No! Don't shoot! Po, how are you? He shot my ligament. Hang on! Call the police. Paul, tell me the address of Officer Wong. OK, please wait. I can't wait, tell me right now. I'll check it at once. Miss Chan. Where is your husband? He doesn't live here. Don't lie to me. You must know Where he is! Tell me Where he is now! I don't know. We're divorced, I don't know anything. You must know it! Tell me right now! I don't know, I don't want to know anything about him. You know I can kill you? Mommy... I don't want to know anythlng... Are you going to tell me? If you don't, I will kill her! No! Don't kill my daughter! Don't kill my daughter. Mom, don't kill my mother! Ying Ying. Madam, stay calm... Madam, stay calm... Give me you gun. He killed my mom. He killed my mom. Send someone to protect May. It's not necessary now, harm has been done. Madam, let's go to the hospital now. Madam, I've got it. Officer Wong arrested Lee Chung-mint; five years ago, later, he claimed it was a mistake and didn't formally charge him. I think, he is Lee's master. So they shared the same modus operandi. How are you? I am fine, no injection. I've put Wong Wing-nin on the wanted list. Looking at your face, I really don't have mood to tease you. Be good, go home and take a rest after the injection. Let's sit down and discuss the case tomorrow, OK? Be careful! Madam, I left my phone up there, please wait for me. We are almost there, take a nap. Here we are, get up, come on. Do you recognize this place? 20 years ago, you mom was raped here under this pillar. She was all sweaty. I still remembered her smell. You mom was really naive. She was too careless to open the door for a 15 years old kid. In these 20 years, you have always imagines arresting or killing me. But why didn't you come here? Because you are afraid of this place, you don't want to face this house. But if you came here earlier... What do you want? Let me tell you a story. But with some conditions. First, don't ask any questions. I'll give you time for questions. Second, don't resist, and don't shout. But, you are smart... this house has been redecorated. Sound-proofed, so it's useless for you to scream! And this would make me angry. Do you understand? If you are obedient, I won't hurt you. Today is a very special day. To memorize one person. To complete his mission. A girl... met a boy when she was 12. They spent happy days together. They played together, they went to school and went fishing together. The boy asked the girl, "would you always be good to me?" "Would you always play with me?" The girl promised. The boy trusted her so much. In the same year, new neighbours arrived. Adults, together with some more kids. The girl started to make friends with other kids. She no longer paid attention to the boy. Later, she didn't like fishing. Suddenly, without any reason, the glrl... it seemed that she didn't know that boy any more. She didn't talk to the boy. One night. The boy held a stone at hand. He hit the girl's head with it. He hit her 150 times. He counted. The stone was stained with blood and hair. He was so afraid. He tied the girl up together with a big stone... and threw them into the sea. He was so afraid, he was worried that someone would find out. He couldn't eat and sleep. But something strange happened. He didn't know why! The people... seemed to have forgotten about this missing girl. The girl's friends... just lived normally. They went to school and played as usual. It seemed that the girl had never existed. So the boy stopped worrying. He could eat and sleep again. He was no longer restless. Although he wouldn't forgive people's indifference, he understand one thing, he should live indifferently too. At least, on the surface he should live an indifferent life. In the following three years, the boy was puzzled. He thought it over and over, he tried to understand the world. Why was the world so twisted? The girl was dead, she disappeared. But why didn't people react? At last, he got the answer. The relationship between human beings has changed, because they have choice. The girl chose other people, so she abandoned the boy. After the girl's death, other people chose to forget her. The chose to marry other people, have babies and divorce. To live a nonsensical life. Later, the boy grew up. He earned much money and he became a superintendent. Later, he bought this flat. So, he found some girls he liked to take care of. He didn't let them have much choice. I am the only choice for them. They chose me, so they only love me. This is the perfect homonious relationship man and woman. And you... You've been polluted by the world. I won't force you to do anything you dislike. So I didn't bring you back. Of course, I love you so much. At least... before you forced my only friend to death, I still loved you. Lee Chun-ming, my friend, what wrong did he do? He just touched women in the street. But you arrested him. Big deal? Those are chicks! You need not be nice to them. Kill them, slaughter them, cut their tongues... I taught him everything. I studied, shared and communicated with Lee. But you! You killed him! Why do you do this? Time for questions. You nuts! This is not a question, ask again. You need a psychiatrist. Ask! I wanna ask you one question... If I arrest you... will you repeat what you've just said in court? If you can, I will. Go on. I've been told your story. So, may I leave now? No. I want to finish my job, and I want you to tell the world. Sorry, Joyce. Fight back! May, fight back! May! May! You evil creep! You bastard! I will kill you if I have a chance. I wanna kill your father, I will kill your mother. I wanna kill your Wife and your daughter! I want to whip your corpse! How can you say you are man? You killed helpless women! How dare you say you are protecting them? I want to puke at the sight of you. I lied to you! I didn't come when I made love with you! You make me sick! Am I a real man? Try again and you'll tell. Look at yourself! You didn't come, did you? You are lying. Bitch! Wong Wing-nin! For a distant friend. Hoping that his nightmare is over.
