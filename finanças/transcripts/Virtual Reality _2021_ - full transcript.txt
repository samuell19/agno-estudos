VIRTUAL REALITY They are inside and there is no way out... Okay... Your parents will be here in one hour. -Want to play something? -Yes, hide and seek! All right then. -Who counts first? -You do. Okay. -No, wait. -What is it? Let's turn off the lights. It's more fun in the dark. Fine. You're scared of the Celtic because today is October 31st. No... There's no need to turn all the lights off, Tommy. If all the lights are off, the Celtic may enter the house. Okay... Tommy! You scared me, Tommy. Don't do that again... Here I am. You're cheating. -I win. -No, I won. No, that's not fair. You scared me. Fine, let's start over. You count. One... Two... Three... Four... Five... Six... Seven... Eight... Nine... Ten. Ready or not, here I come! Tommy, run! That's not fair! You said no cheating! Run! Tommy... Tommy... Tommy... Here I am! Come here. Come with me. Tommy! Tommy! Tommy... Tommy. Tommy. Tommy. Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut!! Great, guys. Great shot! Wardrobe! Hey! Did you really have to choke me? Only the feet were in the shot. Right? Yes, only the feet. I act with my entire body. When the character takes over me... Forgive me, I didn't know I was working with such an actor. -Are we done? -Excellent! You really got into character! Hear that? The director loved it! Thank you. I still have to see it, but I think it's great. Thank you, really. I really got into it. What is it, Guada? I think you overreacted. Oh, really? Look! -That's nothing, girl! -It's probably all red. It's on fire. -You're on fire? -He's an asshole. Has anyone seen the speaker? I would like for him to squeeze me a little... You're using what little oxygen you have to say dumb things. If it weren't for your mother, I would say you're too sensitive. You're the leading lady. You have to put up with some shit. Are you a therapist now? You know what they say about that guy... He's a bit... He's on pills. He hallucinates. Talking about hallucinations Facu saw some dots in the lights. Did you see them? Sure, they're drugging our food. Some special mushrooms. I wish... Special mushrooms? Sure. This is a Matias Ricarsi film. You know what they say about him. -Sure. -I have to check in. Excuse me. -Hey, Facu. -Yes? I left your number at the clinic where my mom is. It's the only one with any reception. Sure. Good call. These never fail. The latest model. I had something in mind. I can make Tommy's voice a little more devilish. Like in that film... Like the little boy in 'The Exorcist'. No. It's a little girl in 'The Exorcist'. You're talking about 'The Prophecy'. You're right. My bad. What was his...? Demian! I can put it one eighth lower. Some delay effect. -That will make it... -No, listen to me. Just leave them. You're the editor, don't burden yourself with more work. I'll take care of it. Okay? Just curious: did it really happen? Did they have bonfires to summon demons? Interesting, right? They say so. That's why we celebrate Halloween on October 31st. Cool. I started my own bonfire. A fire really. We were there... The fire and me. Just us. It was an experience. You need to be careful. Should that Celtic dead man appear... I don't want to be here. I'm already scared of Julian with those arms. That long hair falling. Just imagine with that Celtic. You would put the fire down and run. I wouldn't run from him. Something like this. It's a nice crew. Great people. No... They're all losers. But the end result will be great. You'll see. Are you being ironic? This from a guy in his 30s still living with his mom? That's irony. What about you? You're also living with your parents. Sure, but they're millionaires. Fucking hell! Is it hot? Sorry. -You did that on purpose? -No, of course not. You're always complaining it's cold. -You taste it. -No, I don't want to. Don't talk to my brother like that. He isn't even getting paid. That's all right. I'll change it. Coming through... How are you? I'm so angry. Stop that, Guada. You're making me look like an idiot. It pisses me off. Guys... What a great film! Just a quick goodbye. I have an interview. Master, a pleasure working with you. I think this will be a great film. See you. Have a good life. -Bye. -Bye. This will be the first time he does something good. I'm a big boy, I don't need my big sister to look after me. Don't get involved. What if he fires me? Today is the last day of shooting. Also, he's not going to fire you. He needs you working for free. Spit in his coffee. Stop that, you idiot. I'm trying to do my job. You do your thing and I'll do mine. Everyone, can I have your attention? There won't be a second take on this last shot. I repeat: there won't be a second take on this last shot. The director just gave me a go. The last thing I have to say to you... Listen to me: you can work for free but don't be a martyr. Understood? Spit in his coffee. -I'm just kidding... -Get out of here. You idiot... This is an important moment. We will have a raffle for this camera. Please, everyone, be a good boy and buy some raffles. We will use the money for the after party. We will have a party with this. Who wants a raffle? Great. How many? -I knew you would make it. -All thanks to you. -Don't screw this one up. -Shut up! I'll go change, say bye to everyone and I'll go see mom. Can you tell Pablo to meet me there? -Sure. Is she at that same place? -Yes. I'm going. -Call me if you need anything. -Sure. I need to know if you're the right one. I don't understand. Sure you understand. Did you see 'Bloody Esperanto'? I did. You must be the only one. No one saw it. "Contaminated"? I saw all of those. I know you produced them. You truly made history. Success requires some sacrifices. Whatever it takes. The story of a director's death is a guarantee for success. And you can also fuck up your father's life. If you don't kill yourself... I'm here and I can assure you I will turn this film into a success. And you can show everyone what you're worth. Here you go... This is a kind of artificial intelligence. It's better than you and me put together. All you have to do is connect it to the computer, follow the instructions and that's it. That's it? That's it. Excuse me. I wanted to say goodbye. Excuse me. I’m leaving. With everything that's going on I forgot the shooting is over. -I... -I just wanted to say goodbye. I'll call you so we can get together and watch the movie. Great. Will you excuse me? I have to go say goodbye. Yes, of course. I'll be right back. -Hi. -Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm the producer, José Lieght. -Oh... Hello. -Hi. How are you doing? A pleasure to meet you. Likewise. You were really great. I love the way you act. Thank you. Though your last few movies didn't do so good, right? Sometimes you just have to persevere. It may be a hit or it may not. You will do great with this movie. Let's hope so. I hope so... -We will do great. -Right, yeah. Let's hope so. Well... Well... See you. You can go if you want to. Leave me alone with your sister... -Call me if anything happens. -Sure. I'll take this. My little Guada... Just... Look after Pablo. Don't worry, you'll look after him. Right... Mommy... Here they come. -Hi. -How are you? -Hello. -How you doing? -Come in. -How's everything? -Fine. And you? -Fine. Wow... Nice little crib. I was thinking the same thing. What a great house! I'll put the beer in the fridge. -Come on. -Let me take this. -This way? -Yes. On the left. He's a bit crazy. Look at this kitchen... I can't believe it. Don't touch that. Those are sound cables. Hey, take a look at this. No way... He brought the axe from set. -I don't believe this... -This is disgusting. This thing's sharp. And heavy... Hungry? -I'll put this here. -Sure. I'll get that. Hey, Pato. How you doing? -How are you? -You? Fine? Such a nice smell. Great perfume. Wow! What a great house! Look at that garden! This pool is amazing! Is it heated? -No, it's not. -Sure, that would be very expensive. Don't you even say hello first? -How are you doing? -Hey! -How you doing? -Hi! -You all right? -Nice to see you. And Guada? Is she not coming? Don't get all servile. I don't know what that means, so I won't. I'm sure that maniac Matias will have a long face. I can't stand him. If she's not here in 5 minutes, we'll get this started. I disagree. Listen, sorry... I know she's not the main character, but we should wait for her. There might be a good reason for her to be late. Yes, he's right. Something more important than the first screening? Don't start sucking up to Matias. Look at that house. A little sucking up seems fine. Family money. Sure. I don't think he can make a living with his films. He thinks he's the next Tarantino but he can't get a single viewer. Come on. -Hello. -Hi. -Hi. -How you doing? -Fine. You? -Fine. -Are you old enough for that beer? -How are you? -Here. Look. -How are you? -Fine. And you? -Come here! -How are you? -Missed you! -How are you? -Hi! -How you doing? -Fine. And you? -Hi. -Hello. Where should I put this? There, with Pato's things. Want to sit here? I can move over. -No, that's fine. -I'll look for something. Ok, so let's start with the film. Hold on a second. Let's talk a bit. We just got here. Something. I mean... -A bit... -Guada. Here's your chair. Don't get so close to the screen. Unless you want to end up like that girl in 'Poltergeist'. -What's 'Poltergeist'? -The film... The one in which the girl gets sucked into the screen. No, I didn't see it. Is it old? Guys, my brother is from this century. But you did see 'The Ring', right? Yes, sure. Parts one and two. You got scared. Sure, it's a horror film. That's what they are for. -You always watch films together? -Yes... I saw all of Matias' films and they really are scary. But you can come over to my house and watch some with me. Sure... Okay... Can we watch the film now? Shall we start? CONNECTING THROUGH WIFI Get ready. You're about to see a new classic. Awesome effects! Once you are inside, there is no way out... What are you doing? -I have to go to the bathroom. -Right now? Yes, right now. Can you pause it for two minutes? Not really. You lose the thread. Okay, whatever. Where is it? Corridor. At the end. The door on the left. You'll find it. Okay. Perhaps he needed some pills, right? Do we wait for him? Tommy... Here I am! Come here. Come with me... Tommy... That was different. When did we shoot this? Did you do this with Special Effects? I didn't do this. Don't look at me. I had no idea. How did you do this? Did you use a double? Tommy... Guada...? Guada! -Guada. Are you all right? -What do we do? -Call the ambulance! -Let's get her up. Come on, help her. -Hey, listen... -Stop him! It's us! We are there! -Calm down. -Stop him! Run! -Hey, what happened? -What's the matter with you? Wait... Slowly... You'll cut her even worse. Matias, what the fuck is going on? Bring some bandages or something. Where are the bandages? -There's some in the kitchen. -Come on, let's go. Are you all right? -Put some pressure on it. -Hurry up, Facu! -What are you doing? -That's me! That's me. Where are you going? I want to look for Julian. Actor goes crazy on set. Julian Hernandez had a psychotic breakdown. We are about to witness a true massacre. Why is he doing this? For fame? For money? Or did he simply forget to take his pills? Ladies and gentlemen, this is what happens when you can't tell fiction from reality. You can see... the poor conditions in this place. What are you doing? Are you crazy? Turn down the camera. You frightened me to death. -Stop fucking around. Turn that off. -Come on... Come on, let's get out of here. We'll keep trying to find the killer. Tension... It's our star editor and programmer. What do you think about all this? What do you think? Can you put that light off, you asshole! I need ten more minutes and I got myself a short film. Let's see... Can you put the camera down? -Stop fucking around. -All right! I'll leave it, relax. Hernan, what is it? Help me! No! Turn that shit off! Hernan! Stop it! It's not working! It doesn't recognize the keyboard! I'm leaving. This isn't real! Fucking shit! -What are you doing? -Leave me! No! Put that down! Where's Matias? Easy... Calm down, breathe. I'm here with you. Pablo! Pablo! Let's go. No! Pablo! Hey! Pablo... Are you OK? What's wrong? Breathe! Electricity... Let's cut down the power. I'll do it. Stop! You made it work. I stopped it. Don't touch anything! This can't be happening. This must be some sort of a collective dream or something. How did you stop it? I don't know, it wasn't working until Guada touched it. We should put it in reverse. We might turn everything back. No, don't! Don't touch this! This is my life and I won't risk it with that stupid program! What's wrong with you? You know something? No, I swear I didn't know. You know something! -Is this a joke? Are you fucking kidding? -Let her speak. What do you know? Matias told me about a devilish program they use for some famous films, I don't know. Something with Artificial Intelligence. I went along with him, I wanted to stay in the industry. I thought it was a joke. You thought it was a joke? -And you didn't say anything? -What could I say? That he has a diabolical program that will kill us? Enough! Let's just call the police! Where are Matias and Julian? Your sister's right. Come, Pablo, let's look for them. This can't be happening... Stay there! Still! What's wrong? What's wrong with me? What's wrong with you? I couldn't get out. The door was stuck! Stop that! It was Matias! Put that down! -Put that down! -You stay there! You know this wasn't Matias. Police? I want to report an event. It's complicated. I can't explain. Please, come. Walk, you idiot! Come on, move it! Hey, listen. If this is some sort of a joke, I mean... You won. Stop it. No, this is not a joke. It's real. Where the fuck is Matias? You know where he is! Don't act all innocent. You are in on this program shit! Speak! Why did you do it? I don't know what you are talking about. -Are you crazy? -Crazy? Me? I don't know anything. Don't you see he's the only one who wasn't here while Matias left? He helped him escape! There's two ways for a horror film to end. Either the murderer kills them all... or we all kill the murderer. Julian is the killer! You are out of your minds! You are making a mistake. Come here... -Stop it! -Come here... Tie him! Your sister's the only reason I'm not cracking your skull. Come here... What's wrong? Hold on... Calm down, I can stop it. Hold on. Are you all right? Fuck!! No!! Facundo! Please, untie me! I don't think so... I'm helpless this way. Untie me! That's not me, Facundo! Untie me! Hello! Is there anybody there? Is there anybody there? Stop it, Guada. Don't you realize? Why is no one answering? Because there's nobody here. There's nobody here... Let's get back inside. We have to beat the film. We are fucked. We have to keep going. Let's go. I won't leave her here. What's next in this nightmare? This is not a nightmare, Guada. This is happening. We may not be able to control what happens on the screen, but we can choose what we do in here. So let's just think for a minute and analyze our options. Options? What options do I have being tied up in here? Don't you realize it's not me? Let's see... Pato said Matias used an Artificial Intelligence program which turns the deaths into a reality, we all saw it. What happens on screen happens here as well. If we want to survive... we have to help the people in the screen. Save them to save ourselves. -What are you talking about? -There's two levels of reality. What happens on screen and this. I couldn't see shit. Why don't we try to communicate with the program? We could send an audio through the computer. Put it in the film somehow. That's not a bad idea. It's not a bad idea at all. Yeah, maybe. The story isn't over yet. Let's try and change it. Maybe. I saw some microphones. There's some cables in the kitchen. Hello. Can anybody hear me? Hello? Is it working? -How about that feedback? -I think that's just here. Pablo, turn that higher. Hello, it's Facundo! Guada... That's you! Me? Guada! Guada... I can't believe it... We can help you. Can you hear me? Guada, can you hear me? It's me, Pablo. Don't go. -Hello? -It's not working. What a shitty idea. This isn't working. What's that? It's just my phone. Low battery. Listen... Facu, where would you hide if you were in there? I don't know. We shot a lot in that room. Under the bed. Very original. Give me your number. Your number. It's 1551202130. Why are you looking at me? It's a complicated phone. -Hello. -Hello? Listen to me very carefully. Who are you? That's not important right now. I can help you get out of there. What the fuck is going on? Is this a reality show? Is this a horror show? No, that's not it. I'm... I'm... It doesn't matter who I am. I can help you. You just need to trust me. I can't trust anyone right now. You are a stubborn pig. You've always been stubborn! I'm hanging up! No, don't hang up! I can help you. I just insulted myself... Tell him something specific so he'll believe you. Guada! Is that Guada? Is that you? What the fuck is going on? Tell me! Hi, Facu! Can you hear me? The masked guy, whoever he is, he's trying to kill you for real! No shit. I was wondering what was worse: the Celtic or Julian acting? Where are you guys? We have cameras here, I can see you. Are you watching me? How can you see me? What do I do? You saw what happened to Hernan. It's for real. This guy wants to kill us. It's Julian, right? That son of a bitch is crazy. I told you. It's Julian! We don't know. What's important is for you to be safe. What do I do? Remember where the kitchen was? I think there's an exit there. There's someone at the door. Can you see him? It's a horror film, they won't show who's on the other side. Calm down... Don't go out empty handed. Look for something to defend yourself. -Sure. -Take it. Slowly... Good... Stay there. Don't open it yet. Don't open. Stay there. Now! Guada... Are you all right? Guada, I'm sorry. Is that you? I'm sorry. You told me to get out. Here, talk to him. What happened? Facu... Stay there. Facu... Facu, can you hear me? Pick up the phone. Facu, it's me, Pablo. Guada's brother. Listen... Is my sister all right? -Is that Pablo? -It's your brother. Give it to me. -Pablo, are you all right? -Yes, I'm fine. Listen, you need to get out of there as soon as possible. Head for the kitchen. There's knifes there. There's an emergency exit. I'm over there. Here. In the kitchen. Will you be there? Yes, I'm here. Come over. Okay, stay there. -What's he saying? -Let's go to the kitchen. Walk slowly and always together. In horror films it's never a good idea to get separated. You again? What the fuck is going on? Yes, it's me. And you are an actor. You are not real. Get it? You are an actor in a horror film. I don't know who the fuck you are but stop messing with me. Put Pablo on. Don't talk to me like that. I'm trying to help you. How can I be watching you on my television? I don't know... If this is a horror reality show, you might be using me as a character. But I am real, you idiot. I like women and videogames. I play a lot. I like horror films. I don't know what the fuck this is. You know all this because that's all part of your character. That's who you are. That's stupid. I'll prove it. What's your oldest memory? I bet it's from when you started shooting. I can't think of anything. What's your oldest memory? Mine is when Matias called me to make this movie. I was with Pablo... The only thing I know is I'm scared out of my mind. I don't understand anything anymore. But listen to me! Keep going. Trust me! -Don't stop. Keep going... -I don't understand what's going on. Who are you? I have no idea. Walk down slowly. Trust me... Calm down... Look out! Behind you! My battery is dead. Let me out! Who locked me in? There it is! Let me go! Let me go. That's not me! I'll let him go. The bathroom! Close it! Hello. The producer. Bingo. -That window won't open? -It's jammed. This can't be... This can't be real. May I come in? Who called you? I only wanted to be polite. I'm the producer. I don't need an invitation. There's a screening and I come. It's that simple. What's happening? Calm down... Someone wants to kill us for some reason. It's like one of those horror reality shows on TV. This fucker won't open. Move... -Stop, stop... -Move! Open up!! There's no salvation. If I'm here that means you want to live more than expected. Sorry... What? What the fuck are you talking about? One way or another, every one of you wants to succeed. That's why the program selected you. Come on... We are almost three quarters of film down and you're still alive, it's ridiculous. The audience wants blood. Come on! You'll be famous, after all. But I expect some of you will live because I'm already thinking of a sequel. But it won't be you. What the fuck is going on? Look me in the eyes and tell me the truth. You go... I haven't eaten. Good evening. We received a phone call. What's going on? My sister Guadalupe called. We have a situation. It's not easy to explain. There was an accident. I don't know how to explain. You are starting to make me nervous. Explain what's happening and what's inside the house. Explain to me what's going on. There's two dead people. Watch out! Put your hands against the wall! Both of you! Fucking hell! -He's going to kill him! -Hands against the wall. Just do what he says. Put your gun down. 911, I'm standing here with two unidentified individuals. The place where you sent me. Apparently there's been two deaths. -He's going to kill him. -Sure, he'll kill him. He killed him! Pedro, how's the coffee? He's having some coffee. That's not the sound of coffee, you idiot. Look behind you! Turn around! Pedro, open the car. We'll take these two in! -You'll have a nice time. -Pablo! -Pablo, just look... -Shut your mouth! I was first at the Police Academy. They told me to do 70 push-ups. So I did 71 push-ups. They told me to do 70 sit ups and I did 71. They told me to do 70 push ups so I did 71 push-ups. They told me to do 70 squats so I did 71... I did 71 squats... -Lock the door! -It's locked. -Calm down... -What about the police? He killed both of them. Open up! There's an exit in the kitchen. We have to get to the kitchen. Hold on... Maybe he left. Let's listen. Let's get out of here! Come on! Wait... Let me. I think I can make it. It's not that high. I can jump. You'll break your neck, you idiot! I can make it! Don't you realize you can't do it? You won't make it. I think I can make it. No, Facundo, you'll kill yourself! I'm gonna do it. Don't do it! Facundo! -My leg! -It's all right. Facundo! I'm fine. Calm down. Help me! I know how to get out! I'm going to die... Watch out! It's my turn. I'm next... Facu! I'm going to do it. I can do it. I know I can. A hero... Facu! Almost. Facundo! And you... Actors. Committed. Come on! Get up. Whatever is going on, you need to end it. Sure. There's 7 minutes left. Plus end credits. Hand me the gun. Facundo... Facundo! Drop the gun! Let's go... Kneel down! Kneel down before me, both of you! -Let her go. -Matias, look at me... Let her go, goddamit. So you finally turned up. I was waiting for the third act. You too, kneel! Calm down... Don't worry... You'll all be a part of a horror classic no one will ever forget. At the expense of our lives. Julian... Finally someone will think you are a good actor. And it's all thanks to me. Thanks to your deaths. Remember what happened to Vic Morrow when he was filming 'The Twilight Zone'? He was decapitated by helicopter blades on set. And Brandon Lee... in 'The Raven'! They are shooting a scene and suddenly the shots become real! He died... You think that was a mistake? Do some research! In every successful film at least one person died! A crew member. An actor. Coincidence? No, sir! Every success requires a sacrifice! After all... Life is a film made by God! Now! Die already! You fuckers! You have to die! You have to fulfill your role. You will ruin me! This can't end this way! This is not the way to end a film! This... is not... a film! It's over. Yes... It's weird... Now that it's over I feel... Like I ran out of words. Pablo... What is it? What's your oldest memory? -What? -You heard me. I can't even think. Must be the stress. Which were your last vacations? Think... What was dad's name? Answer me! What was his name? Calm down. I can't remember... Don't you see? I don't have any memories. I don't remember anything before this film. Are we... The characters? If we are... and we made the people in the movie survive, at least give us a sign that it was worth it! Hello. I'm Guada. We are fine. We did it. We changed the story. Are we going to die? No. We will live forever. In loving memory of our dear director Matias Gucchinota Our co-leading man Julian Garmendia And our cast member Patricia Maldini Our editor Facundo Casares and assistant director Hernan Portorrico. an OTHER DIMENSION FILMS production VIRTUAL REALITY It's an easy job being my producer. I work like a clock. Are you sure you want to use the program? They say they actually died, cast and crew. Nonsense. -Want to earn money? -We can't lose any actors. I changed some things. Maybe some extras. Okay. If you believe urban legends. It's just a legend. Who will mind? Crew! Let's shoot! Silence everyone! Crew! Pay attention. We are going to shoot. Sound! Scene 1: People watching a film. Take 1. Camera. Lights! You are going to make history. Action!
