[♪♪♪] This place is fabulous, huh? Now, I guarantee you, nowhere else in Phoenix will you get a view like that. Now, personally, I love the city lights at night, right? Spectacular. Why don't you all take a look around, ask me any questions if you've got any, okay? Oh, and don't forget about the cold pantry. Perfect for entertaining this time of year. Hey, great turnout. I think so. And your set decorating, with this whole holiday theme you've got going on, very, very smart. Well, thank you. I mean, it is three weeks until Christmas, and we both know nothing gets people in the buying mood like the holidays. And on that note, I have a buyer for you. That couple over there in the kitchen. I sold them a country home last year, and now she's going a little squirrely. Misses her lunch dates in the city. This place is exactly what they're looking for. Hmm. And I am sure that I can even get you over asking. Ooh, Nate! Is that your early Christmas gift to me? [Chuckles] No. But I do have an idea of something that might be. Oh! What do you say you and I have lunch tomorrow? Sure. Oh, there it is... Wait for it... She just found the cold pantry. [Chuckling] That's a deal‐sealer. You know, I could have treated you to something a little fancier than this. I know. I don't need fancy. Just need napkins and... So, tell me, are you happy over at Bimark? 'Cause I know that you land a lot of clients that you have to hand over to other realtors in that office. Yeah, but... they have a lot of offices all over the country, and everybody knows their name. No, see, everybody knows your name, Emma. You know why? 'Cause you're Em‐azing. It's true. Look, what if all the clients that you land, you get to keep? Think about it. People want you to buy and sell their homes‐‐ not Bimark. So, what do you think about you and me setting up our own real‐estate banner? As independents? ‐Yeah. Don't make it sound so scary. Trust me. The freedom is liberating. Nate, wow. Um... I mean... I have had a... I have had a chapter in my life come to a close this year, so... maybe it's time for a new one? That is what I'm talking about. Put it there, partner. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, Em', it's going to be such a great year. But listen, before we can, you know, make this work, you're going to have to offload any of the houses that you've still got listed with Bimark. Of course. And I've only got one, and I'm already on it. That's my girl. Oh, and I have got to get to a showing. I'll tell you what, I'll send over the paperwork next week? Sounds good. Partner. I like the sound of that! [♪♪♪] Hey, Heather. How's it going? Well, we're not snowed in yet, so that's great. Except everything looks prettier in the snow, including our listing, right? It sure does, but... we haven't had any offers yet. Well, Christmas time in Cherry Creek is the best time of the year. I know the offers will be pouring in. Yeah, not so much. Or not. It sounds like you could use a helping hand. I can leave tonight. ‐Okay? ‐I'll see you in the morning. ‐Thanks. ‐Thanks. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Hello? There you are. Welcome home! Thank you. ‐How does it feel to be back? Uh... A little strange. Everything looks the same, but... I know. I went through the same thing when my father passed. I had to sell our family home. I hope you don't mind, I decluttered a bit. You know, for staging. Of course. Yes. And you've been outstanding, Heather, with the listing. Thank you. Hey, we are all Bimark. One big family. I just wish I had an offer for you, but things have been really slow around here. Not in the listings department. Lord knows, I have put more houses on the market than I can count. But no one's buying. Well, we just need to show people how great it would be to live here, and let them create their own memories. Especially at Christmas. Where are you going? To create those Christmas memories. [♪♪♪] [Emma] One store? Where are the rest of the decorations? [♪♪♪] I'll be there in a minute! How can I help you? ‐Emma! Oh, my gosh! ‐Lily! ‐What are you doing here? Oh, let me guess. The house? Yeah, which I thought, the way Cherry Creek does it up at Christmas, would have sold itself by now. But what in the world is all this nothingness? Cherry Creek is usually glowing this time of year. It used to, but you know tough it's been the past few years with all the other Christmas light competitors, and your dad having to make cutbacks at the factory. Cutbacks? ‐Yeah. He had to let go of half the workers. He must have told you. Mm‐hmm. I haven't been here the last few Christmases, so... A lot of people left, and now with your dad gone, I mean... It was like he was Cherry Creek's unofficial sheriff. It's just not the same. I know. But I am glad to see you. You look great. You too. How long are you here for? Oh, just until the house sells, which is also in need of some serious Christmas. Well, I hope it doesn't sell too fast 'cause you and I have some catching up to do. But first things first, let's get you set up so it looks like Christmas exploded in your house. [Makes exploding sound] In a good way. Not like that time I left the candle on overnight. I just wanted something different, you know? Lily, thanks so much. No problem. Are you going straight home? No, I thought I'd stop by the factory. It's been a while. How about tomorrow? You and me? Yes. I was actually going to drop off food donations at the rink. We can hang out like old times. The rink, oh... Is that hot chocolate machine still there? Of course. Nothing ever changes at Charlotte's. It's a date then, my friend. Perfect. Just like old times. Just like old times, my friend. Yeah, just put that right‐‐ What, what, what‐‐ seriously? Really? Drive safe. Yeah, with this around my neck. ‐Bye! ‐Yeah, bye. [♪♪♪] Hey. [♪♪♪] [door opens] [Emma] Hello. [♪♪♪] ‐Am I seeing things right now? Hi, Ben. Such an unexpected surprise. How long have you been in town? Long enough to know you still work late. Yeah, well, someone's got to pull their weight around here now. You're the new sheriff around here. You could probably give yourself a little break. Is that an official directive from an official Simmons? [Laughs] Mm‐mm. I would never pull rank just because my family's name is on the building. But I am kind of hungry. ‐Good, cause I haven't had dinner yet either. You can let me know what you're doing back here in Cherry Creek? 'Cause, I mean, the last time you were here... I would love one of those meatloaf sandwiches from Mr. Porter's. Is he still open? The day Mr. Porter closes... is the day I'm outta here, too. After you. Thank you. Oh, yes... [chuckling] Oh, I can smell the nutmeg in the gravy. That could be the only thing that hasn't changed around here. Well, I wouldn't know anything about that, because, apparently, my dad didn't tell me that the factory is having trouble. Emma, your dad knew your heart wasn't really in it, and he didn't want to take away from what you were doing. I guess that explains why he insisted on coming down to see me for the last few holidays. But, come on, Ben, still, he should have told me. I'm the last surviving Simmons, even if I'm not working in the factory making lights or managing the company. So who's the competitor taking our business? Thompson's. Yeah, they just opened a factory about 50 miles from here. Pete Thompson. He's got deep pockets, they started churning over lights like nobody's business. We couldn't keep up. Yeah, well, that's because we pride ourselves on quality, and after 100 years, that's not changing. We? Now who sounds like the sheriff? [Laughs] Oh, no. Not to worry. I am not going to be stepping into those shoes. I'm just here to sell the house. I see. So things are going good in Phoenix? ‐ [Text alert chimes] ‐Things are going great. Nate and I have decided to go to the next level and create our own realtor banner together. That's‐‐ that's great. That's great. I'm happy things are going good for you. Thanks. I really wish I could say the same about Cherry Creek. Yeah, well, if some people want to leave, I guess there's not really much you can do. [Laughing] Oh, it's so pretty. Yeah. Hey, can we sit down for a minute? Yeah, sure. Now, it's pretty, but... I'm hoping that that snowstorm Megan that everybody's talking about, that it holds off until I get back from Briars tomorrow. You getting a tree? Mm‐hmm. Well, you know, to warm up the house a bit, and make it feel festive for prospective buyers. I hope you got snow tires. I forgot. [Groans] ‐Yeah... ‐You're gonna need those. All right, I'll figure something out. I mean, if you want, I could‐‐ I could take you out there. ‐Yeah? ‐Yeah. Okay. ‐Thanks. ‐Okay. First thing in the morning? ‐I'll be ready. ‐All right. [♪♪♪] [knocking on door] [doorbell rings] [knocking on door] [Ben] Hello? [Emma] One second. I'm coming. [Ben] The tree farm awaits. You have a key? Yeah. Sorry. I hope you don't mind. Your dad gave me one so I could keep an eye on him and things 'cause he was getting older, and... Did I just wake you? You still look cute in that onesie. Why are you early, Benjamin? You ain't never early for nothing. Why are you early? Butterflies, butterflies... Wow... You've done a great job here, Em'. The house looks just like it used to at Christmas. Thank you, Benjamin. I've had lots of experience decorating it. [Ben] Wow... I still remember these... these decorations from high school. Ah... better. This is for you. Oh, thanks. And... maple syrup. You remembered. Emma, you used to carry around a bottle of that in your bag. I don't know how many times I had to explain it was just syrup, and that my girlfriend wasn't trying to give her coffee a little extra kick? Well... I like what I like, and I will not compromise. All right, top it up, and then we should get going so you can finish decorating. All right. Cool. Hey, listen, on the way, do you mind if we stop and‐‐ [Ben clears his throat] Carrot. No raisins. ‐Thank you. ‐Mm‐hmm. Shall we? All right, let's do this. I'm gonna wear Dad's stuff today. ‐Thanks. ‐Yeah. Your mom would always give your dad heck. Oh, true. But we'd always find a way to get it through the front door. How are your parents? Great. Yeah... Dad's still working in the shipping yard and Mom's still bugging him to retire. So, no plans to leave, huh? No. Never. How about this one? What do you think? ‐It's a little small. ‐Yeah? Go a bit bigger? [Together] "Go big or go home." Okay... ‐Perfection. ‐Perfection? ‐Perfection, man! ‐All right. That's the one. Hey, Mom, look at this one! Looks good, Liam! Hey! Hey, you two. Good, good. Liam? No way! Look at him! I know, hey? Blowing' through town, are ya? Yeah. Just, you know, here until the house sells. Well, then the four of us need to get together while you're here. We can get a sitter and hit the town like we used to. Or the rink. Hey, good times, right? Sounds great. Sounds‐‐ Uh‐oh! Incoming! Gotcha, Dad! You better run, my boy! He's gonna need some back‐up. ‐Do it. Look at them. Seems like yesterday we were just kids, running around with snowflakes in our eyes, without a care in the world. Mm‐hmm. Well, I'm going to round the boys up. I'm going to see you tonight? Yeah, can't wait. And we're going to figure it out. The four of us. All right, kids! Cease fire! Oh, excuse me. We'd like to get this one here, please. Yeah. [♪♪♪] Well, it's not the biggest tree, but it's not the smallest one either. ‐Perfect. ‐Yeah. Guess you need a hand getting it in the house? ‐If you don't mind. ‐Of course not. Okay. First, we've got to get it through the front door. [Man] Hello? Hello? That's a beauty. Dusty! Hi! It's so good to see you. I've been meaning to come over and say hello. It's sure nice to see your smiling face back in the neighborhood. It's... Well, it's been, you know, a bit quiet around here. I heard. Holy doodle. Is that yet another familiar face I see before me? How are you doing, Dusty? Better than good. The last time I saw you two guys together was... well, I don't know, but it was sure a long time. Well, Ben is just coming by to help me get the tree in the stand, and... I thought I'd get the place all, you know, Christmassy for potential buyers. Yeah, well, don't make it too homey in there, or you may find yourself staying. I don't know about that. [Dusty] Whoa, whoa, whoa! When Eleanor heard you were here, she told me I had to give these to you. She knows that you love fruitcake. Oh! The fruitcake. Ben, I can get you a box, too. Oh, no, Dusty, I'm‐‐ I'm good, man. I'm good. I got‐‐ I got a‐‐ ‐We'll share... ‐We'll share. You two! You always did make a good pair. ‐Toodle‐oo! ‐Good to see you, Dusty. [Dusty] Okay. [Ben] All right, I got this. [Emma] You sure? [Ben] Yeah. [Emma] I can help you carry it. [Ben] That fruitcake's probably heavier. [Laughs] You know, my dad had this whole ritual every single time that we got our tree. First, we had to start with the hot chocolate. Right, boom. And then he would start playing carols, and he would always start with... [together] "Deck the Halls." And then he would get the lights, and as he would string said lights around the tree, he would begin to tell me the famous story of how his grandfather got sick as a little boy. Mm‐hmm. ‐And his dad, my great‐grandfather‐‐ [together] Roy. ‐‐Would dip light bulbs‐‐ [together] In red and green paint. And he would hang those light bulbs in the tree outside of his window to lift his spirits. And that's how the idea of Christmas lights came to be. And that is how‐‐ [together] Simmons Lights came to be. You know, I'm still surprised that you... you know, never followed up in the family business. Well... I guess lights just isn't my thing. You know, I really hope that all these ornaments have hooks on them. What is... what is... what is this? ‐What you got? ‐ [Emma shrieks] Geez. What is this? [Emma] I'm sorry. I found that when I was getting the Christmas stuff out of the attic. It's a Christmas present that I made for Daddy one year when I was little. It was from a stuffed animal. How do I look? Excuse me, but the tail goes in the back. ‐The tail goes in the back. ‐Oh, in the back? ‐Yes. ‐Okay. All right. [Ben] Just a little switcharoo. There we go. [Emma] Yeah, switch it around. I hope that's not real. ‐Hey. ‐Hey. We didn't hear you come in. Yeah. Sorry, I guess I should have knocked. I'm just not used to anyone being here. It's fake. Well, the house looks nice. Definitely homey. Well, I always find that... staging makes all the difference. That, and accepting lower offers. I think it might be time, Emma. Yeah, I mean... you're here, so you know the market, right? So, okay, yeah, let's... let's do it, I guess. Great. ‐Ben? ‐Hmm? I'll see you later, around 6:00? I'm going to make that chicken casserole that you like so much. You don't have to go to all that trouble. It's not any trouble at all. Emma, I'll set up the open house for this weekend. Okay. Chicken casserole, huh? I didn't know you were such a fan, Benjamin. She makes a really good one. Don't say anything, but almost as good as Mom's. That's saying a lot. Well, I mean, you know, she's... she's lovely. I don't know her, you know? She's been helping me with the listing, and, you know, she hasn't even been in town long. What, like, five years? Six, actually. Right. [Telephone rings] Excuse me. Hey, Nate. Hey, there's my Em‐azing girl. How's everything going? Uh, it's cool, it's fine. I'm just doing some staging. ‐Well, that's your thing. ‐That's my thing. Listen, do you have a minute to talk? Uh, can I call you back? Don't worry. I actually have to go to the factory. Are you okay finishing up the tree? I've done it hundreds of times. No, no, go ahead. Go ahead. You first. Um... thank you. Thank you for helping me. No worries. I'll see you around? Mm‐hmm. It's good to have you back. [Nate] Em'? Hey, Em'? You there? Yeah. Yeah. I'm here. Wow. I can't believe this thing still works. And look what I brought. You are a champion. Well, I learned from the champion herself. Well, don't I see a couple of ladies who know how to nosh. Aurora! Oh, my goodness! It's good to see you! You are still such a breath of fresh air. Do you... have any treats for us to try? I do, I do. Just some heavenly dark chocolate I've married with some day‐old popcorn. A better union than my first husband and me. Although he did teach me to follow my heart. Unfortunately, it led me away from him. Mm. Delicious. Okay... got a little heat. Of course‐‐ because we know every marriage needs a bit of that. She's right. Oh, I have some donations for Kathy's food drive. Kathy will be so thrilled. You know how she loves the spirit of the holidays. Mm‐hmm. Kindness and compassion. And of course, she can definitely count on Simmons Lights' annual holiday donation. You father always knew how to make this town shine‐‐ in more ways than one. Now, if you'll excuse me, ladies, I have another delivery from Edna's Edibles I need to unpack. ‐She hasn't changed, huh? ‐Uh‐uh. ‐Hey, can we hang out a minute? ‐Of course. All right, cool. You know what I love about us? What? That it can be years since we've seen each other, and when we do, it seems like yesterday. I love that about us, too. [Whistling] Hey, no skates, no ice! Oh, look at these two. No food or drinks! Okay, but what if it's water, because, I mean, that's frozen water. I mean, if it spills and freezes... it really messes with the condition of the ice, and then our Zamboni guy, George, oh, my word, he gets so upset. Oh, Zamboni in five minutes. Five minutes! Rose is still running this place like a tight ship. Oh, my gosh, like the day she started, when it was a summer intern. Yup. Things have not changed around here. [Emma] Home sweet home. Speaking of home, what's up with Ben and Heather? I wish I could tell you, but every time I ask Phil, he just says they're just hanging out. Men. They never know how to get the dirt on things. It would be nice for Ben if they were... Would it? ‐What's all that about? What? Come on, Em'. This is Ben we're talking about. I mean, why do you think it's taken him so long to "hang out" with someone? Because, unfortunately, everyone's moving away from here. Because he's held a torch for you forever. Come on, Lil'. I left Cherry Creek 20 years ago. When you love someone... time doesn't change that. What about you? Anyone new in your life? My colleague, Nate, and I started a new partnership. Mm‐hmm. I'm single because I'm busy, okay? Mm‐hmm. It's not because I'm still in love with Ben. I moved on when I left Cherry Creek. Okay? Okay. [Aurora] Oh, no, baby, that's not for you. That looks great, Emma. Thank you. Come have a seat. ‐All right. A little more Christmas can't hurt curb appeal. So how was dinner? It was great. By the way, great news. Interest is picking up in the house. You know, it's actually incredible what a few lights and ribbons can do. You're absolutely right. Heather, you are so right! It is incredible! [Laughing] No, Mr. Thompson, I haven't made a decision yet. No, not on the job offer either, but thank you, and I will, by the New Year. I have to go, but you'll be hearing from me soon. Okay, thanks. ‐Hey, you. ‐Hey. ‐What are you doing here? ‐I need some lights. ‐You got any to spare? ‐Do I. Okay. Come on. We'll hit the warehouse. Wait a minute. Why is it so quiet around here? How bad is business? [Phil] Hey, lady! Is this guy bothering you? Should I call security? I'm a Simmons. That's right. So, Ben, shouldn't Emma actually be your boss? Yeah, well, that would mean she'd have to be yours, too, Phil, except her father put me in charge, remember? How many lights do you need? A lot. For? Why don't you come down to Main Street later and see? All right, I think I'll just do that. Well, alrighty then. I know where the warehouse is. Thank you. What? There ain't enough casserole in the world to make you look like that. You don't know what you're talking about, man. Besides, she already has herself a Nate. Who calls her Em‐azing. So silly. Is that with an "A" or an "E"? I can't wait to see the shop all lit up! Are you handing out lights to the whole town? Yes, I am, and that's not all. I am decorating all of Main Street from top to bottom. Because I was thinking. If a few decorations sparked interest in my house, why not get even more buyers into town by lighting it up? It can't hurt. And the town needs it. Do you think you could spare a few lights to help set deck the school stage? Liam's class is guess what... doing a production of... "A Christmas Carol." Shut up! Ms. Fisher is still putting that on? Every year, my friend. I'm off tomorrow, so I can help you deliver them. If you need any help, just let me know. Thanks, Lil'. All right, I'm outta here. See ya later. ‐Bye. ‐Bye. Can I get this to go? ‐Hey. ‐Hi. What's... What's all this? This is how Cherry Creek is supposed to look at Christmas. You did all this by yourself? Some of the shopkeepers helped. And you're here now... Feel like climbing a ladder? Well, it's your lucky day. I just happen to be an expert ladder climber. Yeah, yeah. Where do you want me to put this? ‐Right up there. ‐All right. ‐Thank you. ‐Hey? ‐Mm‐hmm? Remember that time we climbed that ladder to the roof of the factory? ‐Oh, yeah! Only to realize, "Hey, we could have just climbed out of any window on the second floor. We wanted to get the best seats so we could see the turning on of the town tree. And, of course, I remember. It was the first time that you asked me out on a date. Ice skating! Knowing full well that I was a horrible ice skater! Yeah, I know. I used it to my advantage. How's that? I figured you were, you know. Unstable on the ice, you might need me to hold your hand. ‐Really? ‐Really. And it worked. Hmm? I'm good, huh? [Laughing] All right, what's next? Follow me, and bring the ladder! Yes, ma'am. All right. This is the last of the lights. We used a lot of them. Yeah, we did. I hope we don't blow the town's electrical grid. Don't worry. I equipped them with surge protectors years ago, so... if they're still working... ‐Ready? ‐I'm ready. Oh! Beautiful! Wow. I have not see Main Street look this spectacular in a long time. Yeah, it is pretty amazing. I couldn't have done this without you, Ben. Thank you very much. I was happy to, Em'. I mean, look at it. You're lighting up the town again. Yeah. Want to call it a night? Let's call it a night. ‐Emma? ‐Mm‐hmm? If you ever need anything‐‐ anything at all‐‐ call me. No thanks required. ‐Thanks. ‐Hey. [♪♪♪] [laughs] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [laughs] Oh... what a great kitchen. And we wouldn't have to gut it completely. Maybe just the cabinets and a new island. Your family? My mom and dad. Yeah, they built this house in the '70s, but the land has been in my family for generations, dating all the way back to my great‐grandfather, Roy Simmons. How sweet. They're offering about 5 % below asking, but at least that way, they can renovate. Reno‐‐ I'm sorry, no. I'm not entertaining any offers below asking. Emma, we have been over this. It wasn't moving. [Woman] Does the second bedroom upstairs have an en suite? No, but one could easily be added if you take out the adjoining room. That's my bedroom! I said that out loud. I'm sorry. Please, take a look around. 3 %. 3 % below asking. If they take that, maybe. I will entertain that offer. Maybe! Gut my kitchen‐‐ I'll gut you. Shall we take a look at those bedrooms? Bam! Where did you find these? Daddy's study. I hadn't started packing anything up yet, so I didn't see them sooner. So what are we looking at? Well, it looks like he was trying to play around with watts and voltage. To create a new light? Yeah. Could be. But I won't know for sure until I have more time to decipher these. ‐Do you mind? ‐No, of course not. You're the only one who understands them. You knew how Daddy's brain worked because it's just like yours. Well, let's hope my brain doesn't fail me now. All right... [Emma] The kids must be busy making their decorations for the town Christmas tree, huh? Actually, they haven't been. What? Why? It's school tradition. You and I even made them when we went here. I know, except this year, the town scrapped the annual lighting event. What? Why? I mean, that's just as big as the town Christmas Eve party. Yeah... they scrapped that, too. ‐Are you kidding me? ‐No. Why? ‐Every year, the celebrations keep getting smaller and smaller, but this year, nothing. Trust me, my family's really disappointed. I'm disappointed. I'm not even supposed to be here. Oh, wow... Oh, man, Lily! Hey, remember this? How Ms. Fisher used to get up here all the time, and preach to us about emoting from the stage. Yes. Boys and girls, you must use your whole body... when expressing yourself. Remember my part? "I will honor Christmas Past, Present, and Future. The spirit of the three, dwell within me, and I shall not shut out the lessons that they teach!" [Laughs] Hey, Ms. Fisher. Emma Simmons. I'm happy to see that you still remember your lines and that the lessons I taught were not lost on you. No, ma'am. No, they were not. If we need an understudy, I'll know where to find one. Right here. Why didn't you say something? [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [knocking on door] It's open! [Emma] Hey. ‐Hi. ‐Hi. ‐I'm sorry. I probably should have called, but I was so excited, I just came over. Is it about dad's plans? I think I figured them out. Okay, so... What your dad was trying to do was create a new Christmas light that projects more luminance than ever before, but that uses less energy. A brighter Christmas light? ‐Exactly. Can you do it? That's the thing. See, your dad's plans were never finished or tested‐‐ Yeah, I know. But I'm going to do my very best to realize his vision. Yeah. Oh, Ben. Oh, thank you! You're welcome. [Timer beeping] ‐The oven. ‐Yeah. Smells like you're making something of your own over here. I am, indeed. My mom's sugar cookies. Oh, you mean the ones with the colored sugar? Those would be the ones. Mm! So good! I mean, I would help you out, but, you know... Oh, I know! But I'd be more than happy to help you test them, though. Well, you know, I think you deserve a little something‐something for figuring Dad's plans out. So, why don't you tell me more about that, and I will work on this next batch. Your terms are acceptable. So... your dad figured a way for the new bulbs to use less than the 600 milliamps of electricity that they currently use... Pizza and cookies. My favorite meal. Better than casserole? [TV announcer] Oh‐ho‐ho! Hi there! It's Christmas time. The time to sparkle. Let Thompsons' Lights help you show off all that glitters with our vast array of lights. From globes to our traditional blinkers, because at Thompsons, the lights never go out. Yeah, right. You know, your dad once bought a set of their lights just to check the quality. They only lasted one season. That's it. Come on. Let's get out of here. To go where? You'll see. [♪♪♪] ‐Oh, wow. ‐Right? Look at this. I haven't been up here in years. Used to be our favorite spot to get away. Your bench! The bench that you made‐‐ it's still here. Mm‐hmm. ‐Looks good, too. ‐Yeah! It's still sturdy. ‐Aw, thank you for this. ‐My pleasure. I remember we used to come up here after every single Christmas Eve party. Yeah. [Emma] The night that the town just shines the brightest because everybody has put out as many Christmas lights as possible to make sure that Santa would not miss little Cherry Creek in his travels. Yeah, I remember that. Mm‐hmm. And another night in particular. Our first kiss. Did you plan that, too? Like the skating? Uh, no. No, you shouldn't plan something like that. It should just happen. Is it just me or... does the town seem dimmer? [Ben] No, it isn't just you. But if I can get those new brighter lights to work, then maybe I can save this place. What do you mean save it? You didn't answer me before. What's happening, Ben? We'll talk. Come on, what's going on? If we don't turn things around by the New Year's, Simmons is going to have to... Simmons is going to have to go to the highest bidder. What? Why didn't you tell me this? Why didn't‐‐ why didn't anyone tell me this? I already told you why. And, really, if I did, what difference would it have made? Would you‐‐ would you have come back? That's not the point. Who's bidding? Thompsons. Oh, come on, Ben! We don't have a choice, Emma. And I don't have a choice either. If the factory closes, I'm going to have to accept the job they offered me, no matter how bad it pains me. And I don't want that. So, if we want to get our town and our factory back to where it was... ...then we've got to realize my father's plans, right? Yeah. Okay. So then you'd better figure out how to make those new lights work. And I will do everything I can to brighten this place up. You got it, boss. Lil'! Hey. I'm over here. Girl! I got the greatest tree ever! It's over 20 feet! What? For what? Your house! No! Okay, so I went down to City Hall. They were so happy to see me! Of course. Okay, anyway, so I went down to city hall, and I said to them that I cannot in good conscience allow them to cancel the Christmas Eve party and the tree‐lighting ceremony. So guess what? It's back on! Yeah! Yeah! Yes! I'm going to call the school and tell them that the kids better get their creative caps on. Great! ‐Great! ‐Great! Yes! I gotta still close the shop. ‐Hey. ‐Hey. ‐Nice shirt. ‐Nice shirt. So how's it going? Any luck? Not really. How about you? Well, actually, I've had some success. Really? Oh, yeah. So, anything I can do around here to help? Yeah, sure. I mean, if you know anything about 20‐gauge copper wiring and filaments. Don't forget about the copper contacts and the injection molding. Okay! ‐Whose baby girl am I? ‐Right. Touche. Of course. ‐Okay, uh... ‐What are we doing? Okay, well, first of all, you can wrap this around the base, okay? ‐Mm‐hmm... ‐Make sure it's nice and tight. ‐Okay. ‐Good. You are so passionate about this. I am. I mean, for me, there's no better feeling than seeing your creation light up for the first time. You know, it's kind of like... ‐Magic. ‐Magic. Yeah, exactly. So... So you think this magic is ready to be tested? I think so. Ready? ‐Born ready. ‐Okay. Three, two... [crackling] That's not magic, that's smoke. Maybe it's the type of wiring or the wattage. [Heather] Hello? Ben, are you in‐‐ ‐I've been texting you. ‐Heather‐‐ [Heather] We were supposed to meet for coffee. Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry. I must have lost track of time. We've just been here working on these new lights... Oh. Emma, I didn't realize you were an engineer as well. Oh, no. I'm just my father's child. I don't know if you guys realize, but my uncle was an engineer. ‐Is that right? ‐He worked on tankers, so... I also know a thing or two. ‐This connection... ‐No, no, no! ‐No, no, no! ‐No, no, no! Don't touch it! ‐You okay? ‐Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks. Maybe instead of coffee, we could meet for tea or a dessert later tonight? I have the open house at Emma's. Oh, no. I can... I can handle that. I appreciate that, Emma, but I did set up to meet a few good prospects, so I think it would reflect poorly if I wasn't there. Of course. Tomorrow morning. Before work. Sounds good. And I won't forget to set my reminder. All right then. I'll keep you posted on the open house? Thank you. Good luck... with all this. We're goSo... eed it. Back to making magic? I think we've done enough damage for today. Right. Next time, no explosions. Alrighty... [Ben] I know what will cheer you up. Why don't you come with me to my parents' house for dinner tonight? I know they'd love to have you. Oh, I would love to see them. And they'd love to see you. I don't want to put your mom out. You know, if she's not expecting company, I don't want to throw her off. Emma, when I'm coming home for dinner, my mom cooks enough for a week. Seriously. And besides, you're not company, you're practically family. Come on! Mom? Dad? [Mom] You know where I am‐‐ in the kitchen. I hope you remembered to bring the Tupperware I sent you home with so I can fill it up again. I did, I did. And I brought one for Emma. Emma? Mm‐hmm. I would never turn down leftovers of your stew, Mama Leo. Emma Simmons! Let me look at you. Carl, get in here! [Dad] I just pulled out the hot plate from the buffet if that's what you're wondering. Hi, son. [Mom] Forget that. Look who's here. Emma? If it isn't little Em'. [Emma] Carl! ‐Are you back for Christmas? ‐I'm not sure. Of course, she is, aren't you? It's been far too long since you've been home for the holidays. What, about three years now? Yes, sir. That's right. The last holiday we saw you was at the town Christmas party the year we got so much snow, everyone had to snowshoe to Main Street. My dad had to get all of our old skis out of the attic. Ben hitched a sleigh to the back of his truck and hauled all the kids from school so they wouldn't miss it. ‐That was a fun time. ‐Yeah. Even better, your father spiked the eggnog. Oh, no, sir! Not my Daddy! Oh, yes! All right, you three, head on in and have a seat at the table before my stew boils down. There we are. Good to have you back. [Emma] It's good to be here. We got all night to catch up. Mama Leo, I almost forgot how good your cooking is. It is truly a shame that you did not pass any of those skills on to your son. I am stuffed, honey. Listen, I tried, but I couldn't get his head out of the clouds or whatever else was going on up there long enough to teach him. Thank goodness, your father harnessed all that. Thank goodness, Ben stayed. [Carl] Yeah. [Emma] Simmons Lights is incredibly lucky to have him. Wait a minute, wait a minute. None of us would even be here if it wasn't for that factory. So cheers to Simmons. To Simmons. Cheers! Cheers! By the way, I'm sure I saw a tree standing in front of the church today. I thought that was canceled. It was. But I went down there, and I told them that as long as I'm here, we're gonna keep that tradition. That's my girl. Preach. Baby girl, I hope you don't go anywhere, 'cause tradition is exactly the glue this town needs to stay together. Hear, hear. We're gonna need a little more than that. This one will be for you. Thank you. You always did take such good care of us. Well, I just wish Ben had someone to look after him other than me. Look at him out there‐‐ changing that bulb. How is he? Really? He's hard on himself. Worries about keeping Simmons afloat. But... I'm sure after seeing you here, it's much better now. He misses you. We all do. This town just isn't the same without a Simmons. Maybe I can... I don't know, extend my stay a little longer. You know if you do, there's always a spot for you to hang your stocking. And always a seat for you at the table. I know. Thank you. Baby... no need to thank family. [Carl snoring] Now, I can hear Carl snoring in that armchair from here, so I'd better get the old man off to bed. He's getting it in. [♪♪♪] [Emma] Hey. Hey, you. Did my mom haul my dad out of the armchair yet? She's on it right now. Every year. ‐Thank you. ‐Oh, yeah. Thank you.... ...for bringing me here tonight. It's just like old times, huh? It felt good. It feels good to me, too. [Cell phone ringing] Nate... You should probably get that. It's all right. We've been texting all day. I'll call him back later. You know, that whole partnership with him sounds like a great opportunity. It is, actually. So I'm sure you're hoping Heather had a successful open house. I guess. So why are you... making such an effort in this town if you're just going back to Phoenix? I hadn't planned on it. When I got back here... ...I realized it's still home. My great‐grandfather's factory brought people here for work. A town was created. I can't just throw that away. So, I thought I'd just, you know, see what I could do while I was here. And if the lights don't work, well... Emma, I can't guarantee they will. It will not be the first time I've been disappointed. Emma... what is it? 'Cause I know you, and I know there's got to be more to why you went 800 miles to Phoenix... a place that couldn't possibly be more different than your hometown. When my mom got sick, I was only eight years old. I remember that. And I would remember all the times that my dad would tell that story, when he was decorating the tree, about my great‐grandfather getting his son better... when he would string up all those painted lights. So I tried it. I decorated my mom's room with lights. It didn't work. Until then, I had believed every word that my dad and my whole family had said for generations about lights. And how magical they are. But after that... I wanted nothing to do with them. Why didn't you ever tell me this? I'm sorry. But it was mine... and I buried it. My dad didn't even know. The crazy thing is... I want to believe again. I really do. I'm gonna go. Emma... I'm gonna make you believe again. I promise. I'm gonna go home. [Nate] Emma, there you are. What's going on? I mean, you haven't returned my text messages. I know, I know, and I'm really sorry. It's been busy. Busy with the sale, I hope. So how's it going? Uh... it's going. As in going, going, gone? Not yet. Hey, um... do you believe in magic? Look, Emma, I believe that you can make magic happen, okay? Like selling that house of yours. You just can't give up. You know, Nate, you actually kind of make sense right now. Thank you. Always happy to help. I'll keep you posted. Hey, guys! Whoo! Ah, there you are! All right, kids, Ms. Simmons is here to get you all started on what? [Children] Tree decorations! Yes, yes, yes! So let's get started so we can make that tree shine so bright! ‐Whoo! ‐Let's do it. Oh, look at these. Here you go. My mom says you're going to light up the whole town brighter than it's ever been. Did she say that, now? Uh‐huh. She says it's your "density." You just don't know it. It seems you've created quite a stir here, Emma. Not just in my classroom. My own grandkids weren't coming this year for the holidays, but when they found out that the tree ceremony was on again, they begged my son to bring them. So your efforts are making a real buzz. Near and far. You just gave me a great idea. Oh, Ms. Fisher! Oh, thank you! Okay! All right... Okay, kids, let's make Cherry Creek sparkle! [Children] Yay! Very nice. Oh, oh, oh. Almost. There you go. Think we got enough lights on there? I wrapped it in about 3,000. Double the recommended lighting per foot. Oh, it's perfect. Standards are not meant for Cherry Creek. We need this tree to shine. For a lot of reasons. ‐Yeah? ‐Mm‐hmm. What you got up your sleeve, Simmons? I called the local press, and I told them that Simmons Lights has an announcement. ‐You didn't? ‐I did. Why not, huh? I mean, we need to create a buzz, and people need... they need to get excited. It's time for people to remember that Simmons is still the name in Christmas lights. I'm not giving up, are you? Never. Six, five, four, three, two, one... [crowd cheering] Great job. Looks beautiful. That tree is definitely not standard. Looks like another Simmons is finding a way to shine. ♪ This little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ ♪ This little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ Emma! Christmas may have come early for us. We have a very interested buyer from the open house the other night. Oh, great. Yeah, he'd like to come take another look at the house tomorrow. Sure. Of course. Okay, great. And Ben? Maybe we can go for that coffee afterwards? Yeah, yeah. That would be good. Excuse me. ‐Emma Simmons? ‐Uh‐huh. Hi. I'm Katy Jenkins from Channel 37 News. Yes, hello. We're ready for you if you are. Okay, yes. Oh, you know what, I would really like to include our head engineer, Ben Shields, in the interview. Uh, wait. No, no, you don't have to. I do. Great. Follow me. Okay... Right here. Okay. Yeah, great, and just a little bit closer. Yeah. That's it. We got this. Okay, so I'll introduce you, and then both of you can take it away. ‐Okay. ‐Okay. Take what away exactly? We're good. I'm here in Cherry Creek for the town's annual tree lighting, compliments of the oldest name in Christmas lights, Simmons, who have a very special announcement to make‐‐ and here to make it is Emma Simmons herself. So, Emma what do you have in store for us? Well, we have a new and exciting light that will outshine all the holiday lights on the market and make them even seem a little dull in comparison. Wow. Sounds absolutely brilliant. And when will we be treated to this spectacle? Christmas, of course. Of course. Well, there you have it. Simmons will be turning on its newest and brightest lights just in time to light up the holidays this Christmas. That was great. Great. Thanks so much. ‐Thank you. Come on. Okay, I know, and I don't want to add any pressure to you, I really don't, but, Ben, I just feel like this is‐‐this is our shot. You're right. And I get it. I mean, look‐‐ look at all their faces. It's like they're starting to believe again. Yeah. And we can't let them down. Mm‐mm. And we won't. [Lily] So, I guess you guys have another project. That we do. If you guys can pull this off, I promise I will wear the exact replica of my costume from Ms. Fisher's class to the Christmas Eve party. Not the one you wore when you played the ghost of Christmas past? That's the one! [Phil] Oh, that is way too good to pass up. Bud, we have to make sure this thing happens now. No doubt. You better get to sewing, Lily. Oh, it's on. I have the material and everything. ‐Stop teasing. ‐I'm not, I never tease. All right, here we go. Simmons on three. One, two, three! Simmons! I can't wait to see this. Wow! [♪♪♪] [Heather] And don't forget about the back deck. It's a great spot to barbecue for you and your kids. I'll let you take another look, okay, so you can soak it all in. [Man] Great. Thank you. You know, because of the way you've dressed up this town, I have been getting a lot more calls from interested buyers. Really? ‐Emma? ‐Mm‐hmm? Are you still selling this place? What do you mean? It seems to me like your heart isn't in it. And I'm just wondering where it is. Emma sure outdid herself the other night with that tree ceremony. I know. I just hope we didn't overdo it with that press statement. I heard because of that we've had people calling in to human resources, inquiring about job interviews. For real? That's right. Seems to me she's gotten pretty invested in the place. She's already got a partner waiting for her back in Phoenix, Phil. Well, maybe she'll keep him waiting if you told her how you felt. [Doorbell rings] Hi! Leo! What a wonderful surprise. I hope so. I'm not interrupting anything? Oh, of course not. Come on in here. I was just making a few batches of my eggnog for the Christmas Eve Party, and I thought how much I'd love to raise a glass, but, of course, Carl was asleep, so... here I am. In all your glory! Come on in and I will get us some glasses. Now, he is still planning on dressing up as Santa for the party, right? Well, he is if he can stay awake long enough. I tell you, I've been telling that man to retire for years now. ‐Well, you know better than that. You know those two. My Daddy would never have retired either. So, how goes it with these Christmas lights I keep hearing about? I don't know. Poor Ben, he's under so much pressure to get all those lights finished by Christmas‐‐ and that's in three days. Why did I even say‐‐ Never mind. He'll manage. Don't you worry. But what if he doesn't? I mean, does he‐‐ would he take that job at Thompsons? He's been at Simmons‐‐ I mean, since he was a kid‐‐ when he was interning for Daddy. There's no doubt it would be hard. On everyone. But you're right. It would be the hardest on Ben. And he'd never take it unless he had to. Ben, he holds on. Like you. He never let you go. Don't give me that look, Emma Simmons, 'cause I see the way he looks at you. Like he always has. And by the way, I saw the way you looked at him, too. [Moans] I gotta get back to the factory. You have been working extra hard at the factory these days. Yeah. Does that have anything to do with these Christmas lights everyone's been talking about? ‐Pretty much. ‐Yeah. Well, it must be nice to have an actual Simmons in town. I mean Emma, of course. You know, Ben... I like you, a lot, and I think you like me, too. I do. Except you shouldn't have to set up a reminder that we have a date. I know, my head has just been spinning with all these new lights and... And Emma? I'm sorry, Heather. I understand. And I'm not looking for an apology. What I'm looking for is someone whose head will spin a little because of me. Of course. You're right. I shouldn't have to be reminded. Then let's make this easier on the both of us. Friends? Friends. Emma! Hey! ‐Hey. ‐Look at this. You are good for business, so it looks like you cannot leave, otherwise, you're going to make me bankrupt. No pressure! I'm gonna come back later 'cause you're really busy. ‐No, no, no, no! My part‐timer is right here. Just give me a second. [Phone ringing] Hey, Heather. I have great news. Remember that kind of cute guy from the house the other day? Well, he wants to make an offer. Over asking. Yeah, that's great. I know. Can I tell him we have a deal? I'm sorry, but no... I... I've got too much to figure out. Okay. I understand, but we can't wait too long, Emma. Yeah, I know. Sorry. I know. [Nate] An offer over asking? Impressive. Where I'm from, that is a done deal. Nate Scott. Heather Clarkson. Hey. ‐Are you okay? ‐Yeah. No. Follow me. I know what we can do to cheer you up. Come on. His is your idea of getting my mind off things? I just have to make a pick‐up and I need you to help me. Okay. [Ben] All right, this works. [Lily] Whoo‐hoo! All right, boys. All work and no play makes for a very dull holiday, so you're both coming with us. We've still got to test these lights. Uh, uh, uh. If they're going to work, they're going to work later on, and if not, you'll get back to the drawing board, but to do that, you need a clear head, so come on! Whoo! Let's do this! Yeah! Don't fight her, my friend. You know it's futile. [Tweets whistle] Alrighty, here ya go. Now, just remember, no walking on the pavement unless you have the guards on. Can we use them on the ice? You a rookie all of a sudden, Simmons? No. Yes. I haven't done this in ages. Just think of it like roller skating. [Lily] Exactly. You'll be so focused on not falling that you won't be able to about anything else. [Aurora] Some of Edna's Edibles to give you wings on the ice? By the way, Kathy's on the phone. Thanks to Simmons Lights' food donation, she has reached her Christmas goal of 500 pounds of food for families in need. Give yourselves a merry ho‐ho. Hi, everyone. We did it! I never lost the faith. I knew Cherry Creek still had the spirit. Thank you guys so, so much. I love you all, and I wish you a blessed and very merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! I'll talk to you soon. [Phil] Come on, darlin', let's fly. Okay. You good? Uh‐huh. I got you. All right, don't look at them, look at me. You got this. Take your time. All right, take your time. There you go. [Laughing] Beautiful. [Phil] Okay, okay. Let me get this straight. It was you who put the ski wax on the bottom of my toboggan and not Ben? Guilty as charged. Come on, man, it's not like I'm gonna let Emma take the heat for all that, right? Aw, so chivalrous. Hey, that toboggan almost sent me right into downtown Denver. Yes, it did! Oh, you guys, this is so good, especially with a little bit of cayenne. You know you want some. Try it. ‐No, no, no, no, no. ‐Come on. That whole sweet and spicy stuff is all you, girl. Well, don't you knock it. I know, I know, you know what you like. That's right, I do. Well, Phil and I should get home to relieve the babysitter. Oh, I'm sure she'll be fine if we stay out a bit long‐‐ [Lily kicks Phil] [Lily] We're going to go. But this was a blast. Thank you. [Lily] Hey, I hope we can do this again. Yeah. [Lily] And again and again. ‐Good to see you guys. ‐All right, get out of here. See you guys. Oh, man, I love those two. Yeah. Yeah, Phil's been a real life‐saver at work. You know, Lily was right. We really needed this. Mm‐hmm. You know you've done more than anyone else ever could have for Simmons Lights, right? Emma, your dad has been so good to me. Because he loved you, like a son. I loved him like a father. What in the world? Nate? What are you doing here? [Nate] I just thought I'd check in on my girl. See if I could be of any help with this sale. Uh, Nate, this is Ben. Ben, this is Nate. Hey there. Pleasure to meet you. And you. So, I hear you got an offer over asking. That's great. Hey, when an opportunity like that comes knocking, you should really take it, right? Yeah... Or you could just stick with what you've got, 'cause, I mean, the grass may not be greener. Um... I'm gonna call it a night. I'm gonna tinker a little bit more, because... tomorrow's the big day and all. Nate... nice to meet you. Emma, congratulations on that offer. Goodnight. [♪♪♪] [Emma] Don't look at me like that. The reason why I hadn't accepted the offer on the house is because I'm just‐‐ Look, I had a nice chat with Heather when I first got here, and she seems to know why you've been hesitating on this sale. And I think I do, too. Anyway, I guess I'd better go and check into my hotel. Wait, wait, wait a minute. You're staying? Yeah. Why not? I mean, it looks like this place does Christmas up real nice. And besides, I hear there's gonna be a lot of opportunity here soon. 'Night. [♪♪♪] [Heather] And this right here is the Christmas shop. It's open year‐round. And then up ahead, around the corner, you'll see... All right. Is it working okay? Goodnight. ‐Hey. ‐Hey. ‐Are these our lights? ‐They are. Took all the crew we had to turn this many out. But if they work, it should be all we need to get the effect we want. Then let's get them unloaded. [♪♪♪] [Emma] Merry Christmas, everybody. [Crowd] Merry Christmas! It's been a bit of a struggle the last few years, huh? And I'm sorry that I wasn't... here with you, but it kind of seems like no matter where we are... we're just kind of coasting through life. Numb isn't the new joy. Finding my father's plans for this new, brighter light... I discovered what he was trying to tell all of us. Think about how you and others around you respond when light is shining so bright‐‐ from within. Remember your inner light. When I was a little girl, my family taught me the song "This Little Light of Mine." And it's okay if your light is little, because if you share it, you create... brilliance. So, tonight, Simmons Lights proudly launches a new light, brighter than this country has ever seen, so I'm going turn it over now to the man who saw my father's vision through, a man who I think is the most brilliant light in Cherry Creek. Mr. Ben Shields. Okay... let's count down. Five... four... three... two... one. [Cheering] They really worked! You did it, buddy. Not without your help, bro. Thanks, but it was all you. And her. Well, it looks really great, doesn't it? [Emma] It really does. Congratulations, Emma. You did it. Thank you. Well, now, you know, I... I didn't have anything, really, to do. It was you and Ben. You two lit the town up. So if I were you, I wouldn't sell. And I second that. I think you two just might be right. I'm really glad I made the trip out here, Emma, and I got to tell you, I... I get why you love this place so much. And now that it's about to go off the hook, I think... you need a great real estate team. So, Heather, tell me, are you happy over at Bimark? Because Emma could really use some help with our new Cherry Creek office. [Laughing] You, my friend, are incredible. Thanks, Phil. The Internet is buzzing, and Simmons already has its own hashtag. You know what this means, right? You can't leave. This town needs you. He's right. Emma... I would never pressure you... Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I would like to introduce you... to the Ghost of Christmas Past. [Cheering] Thank you, Mrs. Fisher! I told you I would do it! Yes, you did! Light me up, baby! [Laughing] ‐Oh, my gosh, honey. ‐Thank you! ‐Look at this. ‐Right? This is perfect. You look so good. I, um... I know you have a life in Phoenix. But I didn't want you leaving without me telling you how I really feel. 'Cause I know you... Emma... ...better than anyone else. No matter what's in Phoenix for you... I know... that this is where you belong. With me. I know a few thing, too. I know I love this town. I know I love everyone in it. I love the lights that we create... ...that shine so bright. I love you. I love you, Ben. So is this where you sweep me up to the rooftop, and... plan on another kiss? You can't plan something like that. It just has to happen. [♪♪♪] Merry Christmas, Emma. Merry Christmas, Ben. [♪♪♪]
