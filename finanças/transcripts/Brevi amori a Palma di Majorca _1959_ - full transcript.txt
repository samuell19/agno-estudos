VACATIONS IN MAJORCA Waiter! - Look, the little German girl from the ship! - She's not German, she's English! - I do not think so, she's a Nordic type. - What type are the English? Let's make an agreement: If she is English, she's yours.. If she's German ... she is mine. -(In german) Do you speak German? - No. - (In english) Do you speak English? - No. - (In spanish) Do you Speak Spanish? -(In spanish) A little, sir. -What's this?She doesn't speak none of these.Where is she from? - Are you Italian? - Yes, why? You, too? - Yes, what a lucky coincidence meet you here! Of course! A magnificent coincidence! - Are you here all alone? - No, with Mom and Dad. - It couldn't have been different. - What? He didn't believe that you were Italian, but I understood it immediately. - Is it true, isn't it? - Eh! I 'll go, bye-bye. Goodbye! Alright. - Not bad ! - We are in Palma de Mallorca, an international touristic place. It would be ridiculous to have an affair with some Italian girl we meet! It seems a joke! - Come on! - Moreover with her parents near her . - Is this bad luck, you know? - We risk even to get engaged! - Waiter, two gin and tonic! - Forget it! - Who are they? - There are two Italians, Mom. Here too! It seems that this year, too, it is a fashion to go abroad. If you think that in Italy there are so many beautiful beaches... It is true, but we have seen almost everyone of them. Sometimes you have to get out from home. We needed to come here, so far away? How will I manage to do my job? Don't think of your work and especially don't talk about it. - This child has no friends. - I'm an undertaker. - Isn't it a serious job? - It's too serious, Dad.That's the problem. - Do you speak English? - No. - Do you speak German? - No. - Do you speak French? - No. - Do you speak Spanish? - No. - Do you speak italian? - Very little. - I am Swedish. - Ah, it's Swedish! Fantastic! - Have you ever been to Italy? - A week. - Do you like the Italians? - A lot! Very much! How nice she is! My boyfriend Georgio, from Roma. - Pleased to meet you. - Pleased to meet you. I am not. I didn't take her here in Palma for you. - Come on! Go away! - Very fair. Goodbye. But look at these! How wonderful! Mary Moore is the most beautiful actress we have in Europe. - She is even better than Marilyn Monroe. - Don't exagerate it! - She's all full of makeup. - Tell me, Valentino. You bring her coffee every morning in the cabin, how does she look without makeup? Very beautiful! Her green eyes seems like a tiger's. - That old man who travels with her is her lover? - No! A film producer is her lover. That's a duke, who is like a bodyguard. -Then there's nothing to do! - Prince, don't even think about it. Last night she refused an invitation to lunch from the King of Sudan! Then she sent him back the flowers. Everyone would like to meet her, but they understood that there is nothing to do. The only one who didn't understand it yet and still insists is still there. Which one? That cripple one? Here you go. "My sweet diva, this night of fool moon I feel alone. " "Perhaps you're alone, too." "Mary, meanwhile you read I am on the other side of the door of your cabin. " "You open it and I slip in. Anselmo." Let's go! Come on. "Q." "O." Here she is. Who is it? - I'm always wrong, they are all the same. "K." "H." - Oh, God, who is he? Ah, Chinese, you are! The actress Mary Moore, cinema ... - You know her cabin? - This is "K" -"CACA" cabin No, CACA (english=shit)... it is pronounced "ACCA", chinese boy! She's here. Here is the Duke and here is Mary. Who is it? - Sweet dreams, duke, I am Anselmo. I didn't want to talk with you. Who is it? - Mary, I'm Anselmo. - Here. Take this note. This is the last straw! - I knew it! I can't stand it anymore! (In English) Leave me alone, go away! What's happening, may I know? Everynight I hear this one, like a hammer! This is the second day since we arrived and we met no girl! You think a girl fall into your arms the minute she sees you? We came here to see Palma de Mallorca? Be patient. - Oh, look! - (With Spanish accent) May I kiss you? - It's your joke? - No. Kiss me, then! You don't offend me at all. For me it is a penance. Where are you going? You kissed me in front of everybody on the beach. -She compromised me. - Quite right! - I am so sorry...How can I fix this? Introduce us to your friends. I will do more than this, I'll introduce you to my mother. The spanish girls have the custom of the mothers, too. We can't do anything about it. Shut up, come on. I found these two young abandoned on a deserted beach. - Thrown on shore by the storm? - No, landed from the steamer "Garibaldi". - Are you Italian? - It's obvious, isn't it? - You speak fluently Spanish. - Finally there is someone who will be interpreter for Renata. - Who is Renata? Me. Unfortunately I don't know Spanish. We hope we will doing fine with Spanish girls. You should prefer the national product. The national product here are the Spanish women. - Did you know that you almost scared me? - Me? - You threatened me that you wll introduce me to your mother. She did it, I am her mother. - You? - Yes, I am the mother of Inesita. You can't be! So young? - I don't hide my age! - No one would give her 40 years. - In fact, I am 33. - Mamma mia, how stupid I am! - Excuse me, she's a little 'short-sighted? - Yes, I'm short-sighted! I forgot my glasses at home. Funny! - Hey! Look at that girl! - How much cute! - I marry her at once! - How sweet is she! - Want some? - No, no! - Come on, that's good! It hurts my gallbladder. - Why do you think is so special? - She is very special. Who knows her? I would like to know. It's a French, I met her in Madrid in a fashion show. - A model? - Yes, she presented models of Balmain. - And now you do? - It's easy to know! He is an industrialist. Those women have a passion for the industrialists. How I wish to be an industrialist! You need only to behave in a certain way. Do you think he would let you behave that way? In Italy we say "there's no harm in trying." And you want to try? Pay attention, he is very jealous. Better! The game will be more interesting. In every Italian is the soul of Don Giovanni. Don Giovanni is Spanish, if anything, maybe is the soul of a Casanova. - But Casanova was a little boaster. - Here is the national prestige at stake. You have to risk. If I knew what's his name then it would be very easy. - I'll tell you at once.. His name is Andr? Breton. - Ah. Johnny, you have no more excuses. I wasn't looking for excuses, I'll leave at once. Where are they? Soon they're going to take a drink at the pool of the "Mediterranean". - But I'll come too, to check. - Yes, we all come. No, just one. - Casanova goes there alone. - That's right. - Trust me! - We're waiting for you here! - Hello! - Greetings! Hello! - Where are we going? - Let's go there. - On the deck chair. - No, let's go get something. Hello! - Hello! - Good morning. - (In French) Good morning. - For me, the usual one, for you? - (In Spanish) I would like an ice cream. - How? - An ice cream. - (In Spanish) Lemon. - Which? -Lemon. - Well. - Luckily, I understood. - Too much ice cream will make you sick. - Oh, Andre! - I'll bear the consequences. - For how long you stay in Marseille? - Two or three days at most. - Do you mind? - A little, yes. - Come along. - Oh, no! I'm impressed, thank you, but this time you don't impress me anymore. - Why? Last time I waited for you three days ... Because with the excuse of the business you've dumped me at the hotel. What can I do? Business is business. But listen... What kind of business is that one in Marseille? - Real affairs or heart affairs? - They are real affairs! - Are you jealous? - No, my dear. But I advise you not to go with another girl! I don't know what could happen! - What? - You should give me a boat ... Big ... like the boat of Onassis. - I have nothing to be pardoned. He does not want to give me the boat, spilorcione this! See how he trembles! - The boat I will give you the same. - I don't want it anymore. - Why? (SPEAKING IN FRENCH) "I don't care anymore, my love" - There they are, look! - Now I'll show you. I really want to have fun. For me you have a lot of nerve! - I would have such a fear of making a bad impression! - Take it easy. - My friend, will you do me a favor? - Yes - You see the man behind me? It is a French named Andr? Breton. I'll tell you what to do. - If you go with some girl from Marseille, will you write to me? - No, I call you! (SPEAKING IN FRENCH) Pig! Come here. I swear on my fathers! - Excuse me, are you Mr. Breton? - Yes, I am. - Exactly the famous Andr? Breton? - I'm pretty known ... But ... be famous ... - Even abroad. - In Italy, very famous. - Are you Italian? - Yes, ma'am. - I am your great admirer, I would like one of your autograph. - Why? - You are my favorite french writer. - A writer? I'm not a writer, but I'm not even an illiterate. I wrote a few articles on trout fishing but ... ... Must've mistaken for another. - You are not Breton, the writer? - No. Sorry, anyone could have mistaken. A lucky accident. - Why lucky? - Because I am dealing with fishing too. - Are you an angler? - Yes. - Have a seat. - Thank you. - I'm sorry. - Please. - I underwater fishing. - So you are a murderer. Fishes mustn't be attacked at gunpoint. You have to catch them with cunning, with patience. Try angling, see what satisfaction! Yes, sir. - It's just ... - It's true. Now you can call it. The trout angler will not wait, must go to track down. the phone. - Me? - Who has discovered me even here? I'm sorry, dear. May I? - Please. - It is useless to do so the straight, you know? You don't impress me! - Why? You came here with the excuse of an Andr? Breton that doesn't exist. I wish that, unfortunately it is a harsh reality. Stop it, I speak of the novelist. If there is someone who invents plots and tells lies, it's exactly you. - Do you think I've invented a writer? - I could swear it. Excuse me, why should I do that? Because you wanted to be alone with me. I do not say that I mind, but I could not foresee the call. - Do not insist, kid. I saw everything. - What? There at the bar, all that you did ... They call me "Eagle eye". It suits me well! - You will see that he will recall you. - Hello? Boh. - Who was that? - I do not know, there was none. Perhaps I was mistaken for another as this gentleman. And now I tell him everything. - I do not hide anything to my Andrew. - What? SPEAKING IN FRENCH - What do you mean? - He wanted to make an acquaintance. With you? But no, what does it has to do with me! - So? I do not understand you. - He has written a book ... And ... he was looking for a big guy like you to have it published. - For helping him at ... - Yes. I'm sorry, but I do not know anybody in the publishing field. - My bussiness is so far away from this field that ... - I see. I do not even know that French author which bears my name. Perhaps belongs to the Nouvelle Vague. - Too bad that Andre could not do anything for you. - Too bad. But I'd like to read his novel, must be full of clever ideas. Modestly, I think so. - Tell me about the plot. - What? - The plot. - Ah, the plot! It's a complicated story, it is so large. - It can be summed up in two minutes. - It is a book like "Gone with the Wind"? It is another kind, a little 'different. However, it is a huge volume. A very complicated story. - You would not think it is a genius!His forehead is so small! - Shut up! Excuse her. - What did I say? -Certain things mustn't be said. - Look, there's Domingo! - Maybe Gianni hit the mark. - Or the French hit him. Casanova is going to add a chapter to his memoirs. - Come here, tell me! - We want the details. I left him in conversation with Mr. and Mrs. Breton. - Congratulations! - I have nothing to do with it. We have been defeated. Italy beats Spain 1 to 0. - We can go to hide. - Let's go for a swim! -Are you coming? - No, I prefer when the water is warmer. I'm staying here to keep company the lady and her daughter. - Let's go in the water together. - All right. - Everybody, let's go swimming! Come on, I feel like swimming, too. - Would you have liked? - What? - Stay alone with the lady. And why not? Friend Casanova, I like the lady. - Why, you and the lady ...? - Yeah. If her husband comes, what would you do? I would die of fright. - Why? He does wrestling? - No, it's been dead for 12 years. Go to hell! Farewell, China. I salute you, we have arrived. - What is your name? - Ten Ton - Huh? - Ten Ton - I Anselmo Pandolfini. If you arrive in Rome, come visit me, I make spaghetti alla puttanesca for you. Hello, Mary Moore the actress is waiting for me. SPEAKING IN CHINESE - Are you talking about the cripple? - Yes. Shut up, please! All night with that foot! Back and forth! Noone could sleep. - Me too. Here she is! She's coming! Do not fret! Here it is! Mary! Mary! You are the most beautiful diva of all. - Who are you, please? - You're the best! - Go away! - I'm the commissioner of service. He has already ruined the trip, I do not want to ruin the holidays. - I got it, let me do it. - I'm with the lady. - Mary! - Wait a minute! I'm the commissioner, come with me. - Your name? - Anselmo Pandolfini. I work in the business of sweets, I earn a lot... And during the holidays ... I like to have fun and spend a lot. It is forbidden? - No.Where did you meet Mary Moore? - A Capri, a week ago. - I was doing a dive from the diving board. - You dive? I practice all sports but I'm a champion in diving. I do double somersault. After one of these performances Miss says, "Congratulations." "Congratulations to you," I'll tell you. "Your films are so good." "Why aren't we water skiing together? " - You even do water skiing? - With one foot. - And Miss Moore accepted? - No, Mr. Commissioner. She said, "I would accept gladly, but I have to go to Palma de Majorca. I am sorry". - And so you decided to leave too. - And during the trip? - I thought it was my duty to court her. I thought she liked me too, so I "attacked" her. And what was the reaction of Miss? The woman never show that is conquered at the first attack. - I bet she gave you a slap. - Exactly, Mr. Commissioner. But exactly for this slap I told to myself: "This woman has something that I don't dislike!" You have bothered her in such a way ... that she had to call me. - I essagerated. Beautiful women are everywhere ... I liked her because she is the most interesting girl I know. I understand, but you want to conquer a woman which has the whole world at his feet. Moreover you, with that ... - With my foot? I tell you only this: she is a woman who knows billionaires, movie stars. It is difficult for them, for you even more! This may be true, but now I'll explain. You are a man and you can understand certain things. I like the difficult women, I throw away the easy ones. Mr. Commissioner, let me give you an advice. There are no difficult women, because if you always follow them it will happen a moment of weakness and they give up even if they are actresses. You are slapped so much for nothing. -It isn't for nothing. - Sometimes I went well. - Even with the actresses? - Of course! You know that french actress which make crazy everybody in the world? Who? - No! - Of course! - You think only at women! - No, I love everything in life ... ... The sky, the sea, nature, art, music, cooking, everything! All that is most beautiful, but it there is a lady I enjoy it more. - What are you going to do? I think I'll give up. Moreover, when I realize that a woman doesn't like me, I don't like her anymore. I'll go away, there isn't only her! - Goodbye, Mr. Commissioner. - Goodbye. - Goodbye to you too. - Good morning, sir. I hate advertising, the crowd scares me. I don't go in nightclubs, because I don't like the nightlife. I like a simple and modest house. - Whose is that house? - It's my producer's. -Of Count Furlani? - Yes. - Producer or boyfriend? - With the count I only have a work relation. - You know the Duke of Maurino? Not personally, only by fame. - Gentlemen. First of all I am a family friend of Mary and of the Count. Second, I love artists and I am ready for any sacrifice. - How will your pass your holidays? - Only in the villa, with the duke. - Your favorite hobby? - The poker. - You are lucky in the game? - I would say that I can play, it's not that I am lucky. You win all the games, so you are lucky, too. - In love? - Forget it. - A communication from Hollywood. - Excuse me. Hello? Excuse me, it's Gary Cooper. Hello? - Miss Mary Moore? - Who is it? I am Anselmo, Anselmo the cripple! The cripple? You again! What do you want? They released me and I leave tonight preserving a wonderful memory of you. I am pleased to hear that and I wish you a good trip. - Tell me that you don't spite me I don't spite you, but hang up. I am waiting a communication from Hollywood. It was my intention to stay a few days here in Palma ... But ... since my presence bothers you, I 'll leave imediately Please, hang up! I am waiting a communication from Hollywood. - Then you invite me to go? Oh, come on!! Should I stay? If you tell me to stay .. - Do what you like! - Then I will remain here! - What do I care? - Thank you, Miss Mary Moore. I am infinitely grateful because then I will have the occasion to explain to you. Do you remember when in the boat I told you had a nice body? I said in the material sense of the word, but also in the spiritual sense. However, I am a lover of the spirit, but also the physical ... ... has its own importance in life. - What should I do? Cut the wires? Bravo! Now he is communicating with Hollywood. Hello? Hello? Who is this? (In English) Hello? Hollywood? - Who? Very nice to meet you, I am Anselmo Pandolfini ... A ... a friend of Mary. Mary told me waiting for his call. - How's the weather down there? Can I talk to Mary? Yes, right away. Gary, I saw your last film. I think it's so good. Even the fall from the horse ... bravo! Even the Indian girl! Nice little body. Who is she, a new one? I don't know her. Hello, Gary? Gary? Hello? Hello? Hollywood? - This one has hung up. Sir, you leave or you stay? Of course not, I'm staying! - Good evening. - There should be a room booked for Antonio Cordova. Let's see, sir. No, sir, there is no reservation. Mom, look who's there! Lawyer! Hello! - How are you? - Very good. Wasn't you supposed to arrive by ship? - I came by plane. - The lawyer suffers from seasick. - No, I was in a hurry to see you, little gossip girl. - The lawyer must tell me something urgent. - I imagine, he came flying! - Then I'll see tonight? - And tomorrow, also. - I'll stay for a few days. - Well! Meanwhile goodbye. - Bye, Mom. - Bye. - Inesita, call me a taxi. Yes, mother. I booked you a room in another hotel. This wasn't good? No. We'd end up committing some imprudence before Inesita. You're right. Are you mad? - Manuela, when we will stop playing the secret lovers? Soon. - Only when Inesita will marry? - I never said that. I just wish she he loved someone. I'm sure she would understand anyway. You are a widow for many years, I am a bachelor. Why should she dislike if we get married? - Moreover, she likes me. - She could dislike you. Inesita has only me and I'm her whole world. She wouldn't be able to part me with anyone. I feel that. - That's why I'd like that she had a boyfriend. - What are they waiting for?She's a beautiful girl! - You didn't let me finish. Are there any news? - Mister, the taxi has arrived. - Thank you. His name is Miguel, he is from a good family. And then he court me continuosly. So is my rival! Little stupid, didn't you know that for getting the daughter you should court her mother. It is not a sacrifice when the mother is like you. Miguel! - Hello, Ernesto. - Do not offer me anything? - Another time. - You're so unhospitable! All right ... It means that I'll pay. - Listen, Ernesto, would you mind leaving me alone? - I have an appointment. - With Mrs. Manuela? -How do you know? - I'm here for that, too. - You have an appointment too? - I'm meeting her with you. I am not for to the Common European women market ... ... At least mine. So we won't do this Italian-Spanish alliance anymore? You call that alliance? This is unfair competition. Sorry, we have not understood each other. Ms. Manuela is here with her daughter. While you court his mother I will court her daughter. - You mean you like Inesita? - Her eyes are blacks as the coal! Look, Inesita has green eyes. -Green? - Yes, green. Green, black... But you look at the eyes of women? - Miguel, did I arrive late? - Hello, Inesita. - Hello, Ernesto. -There are green! - Yes, there are green, yes! - What about your mother? -She had to stayed in the hotel, she couldn't come. Better for me, today I couldn't accompany you. - Why? - I have to go call my father. Anyway Ernesto will be happy to accompany you. Of course. - So we will strengthen the italian-spanish alliance. - What alliance? The alliance between you and Ernesto. - You will go shopping, Ernesto will carry the packs. The italians do the hard work. - What can you do? Hello! - Hello, Miguel! - Goodbye. Do you really want me to carry the packs? I can renounce if you offer me a better program. - How about a couple of laps on the merry-go-round? What, do you think I'm a girl? - Why, aren't you a girl? - I'm a woman. - I'm almost 17 years old, you know? - Let's go to the amusement park. I told you already that the merry-go-round doesn't interest me! There is not only merry-go-round at the amusement park. - There is also the tunnel of love. - I know it already. - Oh, yeah? - Hmm. I was there with my mom. With me is totally another matter. Here it is. These are my shirts ... My ties ... That's my tuxedo and you don't touch it. It costed me a lot of money. Some friend you are! I can not go at the "Mediterranean" without the tuxedo. Why have you to go there? Do you know how much cost a room there? I don't care, If I'm there, everything is easier. You will remain penniless. This is an island, we can not go home with the hitchhiking as it happened last year in Cannes. Don't worry. You'll see, some saint will take care of it. Do I have a circle of light arround my head? No, I'm not a saint. I don't take care of the others and I don't make loans. It will not be necessary, I'll stay only a few days at the "Mediterranean". Time ... that Mr. Breton remain in Marseille. - Leave my tuxedo! - But if you don't need it, give it to me! - Why should I give it to you? - Do you want to know? Listen up. It is night ... The beautiful night of tomorrow evening. Helen and me are spending an elegant night I am immaculately dressed in your tuxedo, and I'm dancing with her. I hold her tight. - So the tuxedo will get creased. Shut up! She is hot, we'll go out in the garden. The moon shines up. - She lays her little head on my shoulder. - And she will stain my tuxedo with grease. No, she uses the grease that doesn't stain. You hear a violin playing away, the crickets sing ... The violent scent of lilies stuns us ... I kiss her ... and all this thanks to your tuxedo. Satisfied? No, because in the tuxedo it's you, not me! Casanova doesn't waste time with the French girl. - Domingo has paved his way. - Anyway he gave you a good lesson. Look at Domingo with the Italian girl. When she will find out who he is, she will run away! At this time he is France. Yes, and the more he gets further away, the more you get closer. Who knows where we end up here. Why, you would you still be here in an hour? - And where would you be? - In a less crowded place. You wanted to go dancing, right? We are here, we are feeling so good. Let's go to my room. - It takes a little to get there. - I could call a cab. Then you're also funny. I think you take a girl on your shoulders, better than to call a cab. Not sure the type which is crazy for a woman. Unfortunately I can't do much. I like only men able to do crazy things for me. Oh, yeah? I change the fur each autumn. And if the color of the fur doesn't fit the car, I also change the car. - Then I ... - What about it? There is Andrea for all this. Anyway I will never accept anything from you. Try to give me a bunch of violets and I'll make you eat them! - You're a treasure! - The purple is bad luck. - Gianni. - Hmm? Johnny, the music has stopped. - I'm sorry, let's sit down. - You did not you want a cab? - Yes. - I'll get the cosmetic bag before they could steal me. - Of course! I hate to enter together at the hotel. I'll go first, you wait in your room. Then I'll come to tuck. Waiter. - My key, please. - The keys are upstairs. Mr. Breton has recently returned. - 117. - Right away, sir. - Good night, sir. - The most beautiful of my life. -Sleep well, sir. - I hope I will not sleep. - Hello. - See you tomorrow. Andrea! Andrea! What is it? Why don't you answer? - Where have you been? - At cinema. - With who? - Alone. I don't know anyone here. - You could call the Duval. - I do not like Duval. - And then she is not so serious. - You have an evening dress to go at cinema? This one is from mid-evening, is short, come here. To go to the movies you put a mid-evening dress? How should I dress? Like a beggar? SPEAKING IN FRENCH And then look what time is it now! Are 23.30 and with this? Do you think that a girl who is going to have fun gets home at 23:30? - This explaines everything. - Forget about it! - Look at me when I speak. - What is it? - You came back to spy me? - No, I missed the plane. - But you went from here half an hour before. - The taxi broke down. I don't believe your excuse . Do you know ... ... I have full confidence in you. I'm not jealous, you know. Okay, I believe you otherwise would be to make a scene. - Unfast my zip. - Yes. - Well? - How sleepy I am! She is always sleepy. - Thank you. Hello? Ready! Hello? Hello? Hello?

But you're mad, John! Be reasonable and I will try to see you for half an hour. You know how much I like you, but I do not want complications. Here's how you do it. I will take the boat and tell I want to take a bath off ... Instead I'll stop in the small bay behind the rock. I'll be waiting for you there, you'll join me swimming. Yes, to swim. - Good morning, Mr. Duke. - Good morning. - Where is our famous actress? - Do not say anything, I'm guessing. - Why, she ran away? - She went for a ride by speedboat ... But she is not back yet. - Which way did she go? - Beyond the coast. - I'll take her. - You have the boat? - I have the fins. - Row like a torpedo! - I did not never seen anything like this in my life.

I was worried. - You again! - The duke sent me to look for you. - What are you doing here alone in the boat? - The engine stopped. But it is a new boat! Ah, of course! There is still, it is obvious that it wouldn't start! - What are you doing now? I promised I took you back! -This start at once! - Ah! Mary! Mary! Mary! Whoever guesses the song is going in the water ... And who arrive first ... says the title. - I put the disc. - Bravo! - Here is Casanova! - Meet a boy from your country. Do you have these beautiful flowers in Italy and come to seek abroad? You are also abroad. - I know him. We met at the beach bar. -Since then I hoped to see you again. - We live in the same hotel, did't you realize? - At the hotel "Mediterranean"? John and Clementina, make a pair.

She ends signing the papers with the lawyer and she'll be here. - You're not going to take that girl? - I do not have the right scooter. - How should it be? - Black with yellow borders. You should thank me, you could have been the boyfriend of an undertaker's daughter. - You better be quiet. - This is crazy. - You're crazy! - Hello! - Excuse me, guys. - We have a guest, the lawyer will come with us. - Well! I want to see if he is able to go in scooter. I rented a suitable one for me. Please Manuela. - It is an admirer of your mother? - What are you thinking? It is our lawyer for many years and my best friend. - What about me? - You are something more. - Here we are, finally! - We have arrived! How wonderful! Come on. - From here you can see our hotel. - It's true! There it is! I congratulate you for the choice of the son in law. - Who? - What is dancing with Inesita. Not at all! That's an Italian boy who is with us for a few days. - Your daughter looks at him in a certain way. - I told him to pretend it so. - For making jealous the other one? Yeah, to force him to declare his love. High maternal strategy. - Which is the other one? - It's that one. - I'm going to dance with him. - I want to see how you lead the attack. - You make me dance, Miguel? - With pleasure! - I'll see you every day, huh? - You noticed, ma'am? It's obvious, I think. - You are always so attentive with us. - I am more than attentive. - So I saw. - And you do not mind? And why should I? I'm the first to talk about it. It's wonderful. I like you that way, you don't need to be too shy, my boy! I am not timid at all, But we have always seen in three. - If I had a chance to see you alone, I ... - I get it. - You'll have a chance. - When? You should find the occasion. - Yes, of course, but ... - Meanwhile, go and dance with Inesita. - Go! - Quite right. - We change. - What are you saying? - Let me dance with Inesita. - But the alliance then? - Today you musn't carry packages. - The next dance is mine. - He looked at you like as if he was in love. - In fact he is. - He is in love with you? - What a silly thing you are saying! With Inesita. - What does she think? -She will be happy. - Hey, Clementine! - Hello. I did not know I had the room next to mine. Now that you know you could ask the direction to change your room. - Why should I change it? - I know why. - You didn't go on the trip? - Don't you know? - No. - No one came to get me. - They may have forgot. - Maybe. However, they are peasants. - When you see them, tell them from me. - I'll make them apologize to you. I do not care, I do not want to see anymore those friends of yours. - I'm fine on my own. - What did they do to you? - Nothing. - And why didn't you go on the trip? - I'm expecting a phone call. Maybe you didn't want to see me there. What are you saying? Have you heard it? Excuse me. Hello? - Hello, baby. - I'm Elena. - How's your life? You are enjoying yourself? - I've been waiting all day. I couldn't call you earlier But I called you.

I'll call you again. - You make me wait for another phone call? - What can I do? - We could do something else. Hello? Tonight come and eat at the restaurant. If you see me in a red dress, means that he leaves. - If it's green, he remains. - Red means he leaves and green means he remains. You try to wear a "very red" dress. It doesn't depend on me, depends on my "orangutan". Forever "tango", have patience ... I can't resist anymore! Tell the director to change. A little 'boogie-woogie, a little 'rock and roll! Okay, tell him. - What's this? - I complained with the concierge. They are playng so many tangos, seems to be in Argentina! I've never heard a tango there's an neapoletan orchestra. I had not ever noticed. Honey, would you like a chocolate? - No. - It's good, you know? - Better not. - Then I eat. It rains, it rains on our love. Hello, hello baby. - Aren't you ready? - I have an eye to do. - Open me this candy. - Don't eat it, we are going to dinner. Ugh! - How do I like? - You are okay. - With these ears I look like a rat. You are okay. No, for heaven's sake ... oh! - Fuck it! - Don't swear. - Look what you've done! - You bumped me! You're always with a glass in the hand. You always eat ... ... And then drink, drink, drink! - Put on another dress. Damn, we have only one green dress! "Who is wearing a green dress, is trusting too much in his beauty. " You even joke now. Don't dramatize now. - For example put on that beautiful red dress. - No, not the red one! - It is a very classy dress. - No, they already saw it. No, you have never wear it. The red one you have never wear it. - A cup of coffee, sir? - It depends. It depends if this night I want to sleep or not. - If you don't know ... - I'll know. Come again after a few moments.

Rosato or Verdicchio?("Red"or "Green""? - How? - I prefer the red ... But ... this seems champagne color. If you want, I 'll order (to come). It would be better to let it go. - It's a word pun? - No, it's a quiz. It is one thing to guess. What noise make the writer! Who? - That young Italian we met the other day. Yes, I saw him, no need to point him with your big finger. - Be an educated person. - What? - Leave me alone, I'm indisposed this evening. - Why? You ruined my beautiful green dress. - I finally understood. - What did you understand? The style of this room is very nice, is not it? - Is interested in architecture? - I'm in senior year. That's good! And you prepared the thesis? - I just started. - On what subject? - I present the design of a mausoleum. - A grave! Magnificent! - Please, Daddy ... - It sound interesting? - Take me to the stationery shop before it closes. - Excuse me. Go, go. Must be a nice guy I am a writer with the girls. -He's a stupid if he goes with that duck. - Why?That girl seems so sweet. You're not nice, you know? When you're with me you should watch only THIS girl. My dear great jealous girl! - Take down the elbow from the table. - No. - How nice to swim at this time! - What time do we leave? - At 3 o clock all of us at the coffee station. - All right! Who is there is there, who is not ... worse for him! - How boring are these trips. - Just do not go there. - If I look at the hotel, I say that I am out. And Inesita? I'll send her out at 4 o'clock. - But it's wonderful, wonderful! - Don't tell me you're not shy! Today I will not be. - Hurry, it's already 4. - It's not here yet. But no, he'll wait you out! Don't look that way, in fact you don't go to the dentist, you'll go with a boy who loves you. - And if I won't go there? - What do you mean? Must I tell you the truth? I don't like Miguel. - But before you did. - You know how are made the women . Do not be stupid. Ernesto returns in Italy, forget him. Miguel is the boy for you: is serious, affectionate, constant. - Wait until you know him better and you'll see. You will aprove me . -Maybe! - Hello, Mom. - Hello. - Hurry and do not be rude. - No, Mom. - Hello? - I was afraid you were engaged in your usual strategic operations. I'm done for today, now it's Miguel's turn. Now that you've arranged your things can you come to me? I get dressed and I'll join you immediately at the hotel. Hello. - Ms. Manuela Esteban. - It's out. - Not for me, you call it. Give me the 114. Hello? Who? Miguel? Give it to me. Miguel, Inesita is out. I know, I'll come quickly. Hello? Hello? Come in! - Miguel, haven't you seen Inesita? - Yes, but she didn't see me. - So you saw her. - Sure and as soon as she left, I entered. - It's not nice to keep a lady waiting. - What lady? - You. - You're not a lady? - Of course I am a lady. - How come you call me "you"? - At this point we can call each other by name. - At this point? - Yes. - But what did you understand? What did I understand? You made me understand it - You understood that I ... - Yes, I understood. - Get out immediately. - But .. - Get out! - I said out! - Okay, but ... - Now! - Get out! - Don't be angry, I'm off. What a fool! Okay, thank you. - You can wait in the lounge, he will come at once. - Well, thank you. - Inesita! - I need to talk to you. Sit down. - It's about my mother. - What happened? What's happening to me it's an unpleasant thing because of her. More than our lawyer, I always considered you to be our best friend. -Indeed I am. - You were always very close to us. - So what? - You tell my mother ... I don't like at all ... this "engagement" that she thinks of. Don't rush yourself, Inesita. Think about it. Your mother knows what she's doing. A daughter should not impose her decisions to her mother. But it is her who require it to me, in fact all is about me. - Yes, of course about you, too. - Especially me. - So, you're against it. - Absolutely. - Why? Because I don't like Miguel. - Miguel? - Yes, Miguel. But what has Miguel got to do with it? - The lawyer Cordova, please. - Yes. With Ernesto is a serious matter. I don't know how to do because he is Italian and if I should marry him, I'll go to Italy. But I can not leave my mother she has only me, hasn't she? If she had a lover, in fact she is still young ... - If she would marry again! Inesita! - Mom! - Sit down, Manuela. - But, lawyer ... - No lawyer. My name is Antonio. Your daughter is telling me the same things that you always tell her. What? I didn't understand anything. You never understood a thing You got it all wrong ... ... But fortunately Inesita repaired everything asking my help. - Yes. Now everything is fine, but you must stop making a general ... but decide to become a wife. Miss, I have the honor to ask the hand of your mother. Very pleased. He came swimming like a torpedo and took me away. The Duke is grateful to him. Do you play poker? Male? It doesn't matter. It is the only way to see each other. What do we do for the fourth? I can call someone. - Who? - There is American boy a friend of Gary. - He's a good player, should I call him? - No, there's no need. - I already called me for the fourth. - Who? May I? Here I am! - Am I late? - No, you always arrive on time. How is my Goddess? - Thank you for inviting me. - Mr. Anselmo Pandolfini. - Enchanted, ma'am. - Pleasure. - Have you already made the cards? - Don't you trust? I trust, but if we have to play seriously, we have to mix them again. - Take another deck of cards. - Well, a new deck! - Have enough money with you? - Only 2,000 pesetas. - Finite these, I finished everything. - The item is 2,000 pesetas. - How do we play it this way?I would have brought somebody else. - Why, I'm sorry? It is foolish to play with somebody who has only 2,000 pesetas. -If you lose, the game is over.Should I call? - Telephone? Wait, don't call, the 2,000 pesetas are still here. The game is not over and you already want to send me away? - Would you like something to drink? - For me a double whiskey ... Some olive ... and some little salted almond. The salted almond and the olive help me to drink, without them I can't. Open with 100. I agree. - How many cards, please? - One, please. One for you and four for me. One, two, three ... I leave one and I take one . - Four? - Why, is not possible? Sure, but ... All your money. Play hard, eh? That's why it says that the game is ended by who is opening the game. It's so hot! - What are you doing? - I can not raise. I have no more pesetas ... "I see". - "Scale". - Of what ...? - Of Kings! - I have scale of Aces! - Nice, huh? - With four cards! - Now we can play cool. These I'm going to put away. - It's amazing! - Thank you for inviting me. - Duke? - Yes? Here I am. - Duke, what are you doing? - I open with a hundred. - Twice? - Triple. All right, how many cards? - Served. - Me too. - A low card low. - Two for me. - Word. - 500. 1,500. - 2000. - 3000. - 5000: rich dish, I will shove. - It's impossinle to play like that! - I'm leaving. - Me too. - Well! - I'm sorry. - Thank you for this great company. - May I see what did you have? It would not be in the game rules, but ... a small bluff! - This is the last straw! - Bravo, my compliments! Sorry, the game is the game. You didn't know? - What are you doing? You are making the accounts? We said that ended my hand. It's dawn! I'm not sleepy however, let's make a nice capuccino ... Because ... if I wake up in the morning and I didn't sleep I get hungry! - Let's have another game. - No, it's worse.You will get nervous and you won't be able to sleep. - So how much? - It would be 28,000. 5000 you lended me, so it would be 23,000 pesetas. - 7.000 for you, and 18.000 for you. - 10, 20 ... and 25. - Thank you very much. When you need me, give me a call. Thank you for a lovely evening, Duke. At the gate there are dogs, be careful. The dogs must be careful at me they always loses with me. He raised the money, he drank our whiskey, maybe he also will kill our dogs! Don't play with him anymore if he makes you so angry. I have to recover the money! And so, the mother has given me the hand of Inesita. As an adventure in Majorca it's not bad! - You swallow it. - I'm not the only one! - I don't have to marry Helen. - I don't mean Helen. -Who, then? - Clementina Rivani. - We're just good friends. - Maybe, but it's been a week since ... - Because it'a a week since Breton do as the man in the choir:. "Partiam partiam partiam"("We are leaving, we are leaving we are leaving..") and he never leaves! - And you comfort yourself with Clementine! - It's not that I comfort myself. I had planned to stay a few days at "Mediterraneo" ... ... But things are going for long. - I don't understand. I want you to explain. The Rivani are good people, invite me to lunch, morning and evening. If I hadn't dignity, they also would pay me the cigarettes. - But what do you give them? - Nothing. One evening I accompany them to dance, they pay.. eh? Every now and then a trip ... - John, we're ready. - I'll be right there! - Today we will see the house of Chopin. - What a romantic trip! - I have to eat. - Did you get a good car? - Yes, like the ones we have at work. - What? - The brand is the same, but the body is different. - Here I am. - Yes, let's go. - Sir, there's a letter for you. - Excuse me for a moment. ("Andre leaves tonight at 21." I love you. Helen. ") - We'll be back for 21? - Even before, there are 35 Km Come on. This just does not want to! - He found the fault? - Yes, for a moment. I'm removing the piece. - Can't I do anything to help? - Are you a mechanic? -Can you fix it? - Look how small bolts! - You have to find four new to put here. - If they procure. - So sorry ... - You have to look for them in the village. - Is it far? - It is 10 Km - How it works? Wait! Could you give a passage to our driver? - The car is broken! - Absolutely. - Very nice, thank you. - Come on, ride on! - Yes. Thank you. Please, hurry up! - Did you have a major commitment? - No, no commitment. Miss, try again 117. - Maybe you didn't do it right. - Please try again. - Okay, I get it. Thank you. Fuck it! What a rip off! - What are you thinking? - Feel like singing? - Who? - Crickets. I thought they were toads. - Do you know that poem says ... - No, no. - But if you still have not told you that! - If it's about the toads, I don't like them. But no, it's about the crickets. Listen: - "The crickets loaded in the shadows the clocks of... "- My watch is 11 past a quarter . It must be the mechanic! - It's okay. - So what? Now comes my friend with the oxen and takes you home . Oh, no! - The 309, please. Hello? Helen, I am. My love, you were asleep? - Who are you? What do you want? How come, what I want! - What time is it? 3 o'clock. - Go to hell! Because you are pretty, pretty, pretty. I like you more every day. - Who is it? Slip it under the door, please. What did he understand? - (In Spanish) under the door! Helen, my love, I am Gianni! Open it! Damn you! You are joking? How should I be after what did you do last night? Open! If I open it, I'll give you a punch in the stomach. Ouch, that hurts! - Go away, anyhow I don't open it. Gianni, Gianni! My love, it wasn't my fault! Don't tell me lies! I know you are flirting with that little ugly duck! I swear there's nothing between us! Nothing?Only her money, babe! She is Italian, I'm Italian, We are two Italians abroad! Anyhow you have lost, not me! Take it easy, huh? Don't break the door because if I get angry there will be serious problems! - I don't know, I don't know. Meanwhile leave, you do not want to sit there all day. - Go to your room, and then we'll see. Tonight I've been waiting, now you must wait. Okay, but try to do soon. I do what I want. Gianni! Gianni! - Hello, Clementina. - Hello. - Why didn't you come to the beach? - I slept until late.I was tired. This is for you. - What's this? Renata sent it to you. I met her on the beach and she told me to give it to you. - What is this? Can not you see what is it? A red horn! You must keep into account. It can come in handy when you attend a family like mine. Clementina! Clementina. - What's the matter? - If you do not know, I tell you. - What? - My father is a mortician. But I've always known. - Really? - Of course. Hello, bambolo! Gianni! Gianni. Porco Judas! In Bologna, I don't have any friend ... Wherever I go ... and it's all right until it comes out about us. I understand that, I realize. - That's why you were with me? - What do you mean by this? Because you felt sorry for me. But no, what an idea! Tell me the truth, I have wondered many times. Now I understand. - You got it wrong. - Then why? Because ... because ... Why would a young man stay with a girl? Gianni, do you like me a little? Yes, darling, I like you a lot. Me, too, from the first moment. If that one delays a little more , I'll kick him with the fins. your dream eludes you? Don't tease me! STUPID Gianni, let's go and tell Dad. Sorry. Fool! I see. Color. One, two, three, four aces. - Four aces! - I expected. - I'm sorry ... - Give me a break! - Mary, why do you do it? - What are you doing? Crying? - Excuse me, too! What the heck! - The game is game! He's right, we pay and get it over with. - There are 70,000 pesetas. - 700 ... - 700,000 Italian lire. - If you can, I'll get ... - The money? - Will you come? What a game! - I told you not to play. - Do not worry. - Oh. - What do you want? Why do we play here with these old people? - Let's go dancing. - Do not be silly! Two samba, rock and roll, a mambo, a cha-cha-cha and then I take you home. - Why, your producer is jealous? - All right, take me to the "Chico". But the Duke allows you? Maybe he will let me go out with you. I'm going to change. See you later. - Where are you going, Mary? Tonight, instead of playing cards which makes her unhappy I take her to "Chico" to dance a little. Do you dance? All the modern dances : rock'n roll, samba, boogie, cha-cha-cha! - I'll send her gladly but ... - Don't you trust me? I trust you, but I don't trust her. Drink and dance with everyone. I will control her, she will dance only with me. But there are photographers. I do not want that tomorrow ... I block them and I knock off their ears. - Thanks, Duke. Ah! We set those 70,000? - Yes. These are 50,000. - The other 20.000 I will send you later. - Take your time. - You need 10,000? - Thank you, you're very kind. - We are in white. - We are among friends! Tell Mary that I will return to pick her up. Certainly! John, tonight I am going to "Chico" with the cripple. Are you coming? I'll wait there, okay? Hello. Welcome. - Good evening, Miss Moore. - We booked a table. - Right this way. - Please. We reserved the best. Sorry. - What do you want? - Two whiskey. - Shall we dance the cha cha cha? - Gladly. Have you seen? It is Mary Moore! - Don't hold me like that. - If I don't hold you, I'm not enjoying. Nice, eh? Did you see who accompanies her? With all the men of Majorca! Invite her to the next dance. What do you want to do? Don't take pictures or I'll rip your ear! - I got it! - Take him away! - Would you dance with me? - The lady doesn't dance with anyone. Forgive me. Miss Moore is dancing only with me. Hello, Mary! How are you? - Who is that big giraffe? - What giraffe! It is an old acquaintance of mine, a friend of Gary Cooper. Cowboy too? (In English) - Hello, Mary. - Hello, John. I am happy to see you. Do you know Mr. Anselmo? - "Arrivederci"(Good-bye). - Good-bye and leave. He does not speak Italian well. Sit down, John. - Let's go, if not the Duke will be angry with me. - Now don't exaggerate. - Do you speak English? - No. (In English) - You can say what you want. - Who is this? He played cards with us in the evening. Remember the one in the boat. - So that's him! I wish I could knock him off! - Calm down and invite me to dance! Ok, let's dance. - What are you doing? Where are you going? - John asked me to dance. - A solo dance, huh? - Yes! - Don't hold each other, there are the photographers. She doesn't make a move without asking permission. I keep it under the lash because if you loosen the supervision ... you can say goodbye! Who wouldn't want to dance with her? I let her dance with him because he is American. The Americans are a young people. They drink and then they fell asleep. I don't know if you think the same. SPEAKING IN GERMAN - Hold a little 'more, I don't care if there are photographers. - When can we be alone? - Before I had a guard, now I have two. I want to beat him. That one is not afraid of anyone, even the dogs of the house are afraid of him. - You can not get rid of him? - That one has conquered all, the duke included. He is sly as a fox and even sympathetic. Is that what you think of him? If we want to be together, we have to keep him good. I'll make them organize a party so you will be there, too. - Smile at him. - Ok! Ok! Gentlemen, let's go, the pasta is becoming cool! These are al dente! There's for everyone and when is finished I will do again. - What do you call this dish? - "Alla puttanesca". Those previously was "all'amatriciana" are now "alla puttanesca". Oil, tuna, olives, capers, anchovies, a lot of pepper. Here you are! Fill the plate and come with me. - Mary,hot and steaming pasta . - I can not eat them. But these are "alla puttanesca". Try them and you will see. - You want it, John? - There are also for the "big giraffa". Go and serve yourself, maybe they will end. - Nice party, is not it? - Don't make me drink anymore. I know myself, then I don't control me any more. If you don't control yourself, you think only of love. For you what is love? When those stupid ones leave, I'll go to sleep. - And then? - I'll wait for you. - This means love for you? - For me love is like a beautiful peach. I take off the skin, I eat the flesh and throw away the kernel. I don't understand, what does it mean? A hug, a kiss, a caress are beautiful things ... ...but you mustn't give it importance. "How beautiful is the youth who flees though. " "Who wants be happy, there is no certainty of tomorrow. " Who told you that I give too much importance to a kiss? So we agree, I enter in bed and wait for you. - Go away, think of the spaghetti. - Beautiful! Here I am! What has happened? The spaghetti are finished? I am preparing another ones! Come all with me! Hello, my love, are you thinking of me? John, what do you think of love? I want to be a lifetime on a small cloud with you ... And always look you in the eyes. Find a way to hide somewhere. - Where? - In my room. Not here, they see us. Go, quickly! Maybe I ate too much pepper! -Please gives me my key. - On the phone, Mr. Pandolfini. - Who is it? - Miss Mary Moore. I thought that way, she fell in love ... And ... she regreted! - This one? Hello, Mary? Have you thought about? At once! Two jumps and I arrive. - Tomorrow will you go? - I'll tell you later if I'll go! - Mary, I expected. - Did anyone see you? - I know what I do. - A terrible thing happened. - What happened? - Look there. Your big giraffe had go to sleep! - But it's all dressed up! - I'm afraid he's dead. Dead? - Mom ... - He calls Mom, he is not dead! The American doesn't die, he eats spaghetti, drinks whiskey ... he vomits ... and then fell asleep. - Tomorrow the count will arrive. He can't stay here That's why I called you. I put himself on the back, I'll take him on the beach and tomorrow will be better. - Come on, boy! - Mom ... - We've known for two years. We look, we call each other, tonight we could be alone ... And ... look at this idiot! Don't worry, Anselmo thinks about you! I take him on the beach, I wah him with cold water And then, what should I do, shall I come back? Yes... Bye! You don't regret to leave this island? No, Gianni, we are leaving together. But you will still have to mantain me . I will try to do it. I didn't tell you that I have the intention to take a degree at Bologna University. You see?Ernesto wasn't so lucky. Go and confort him. Bye!We will meet at the wedding! So these are your plans! What did you understand?I meant my... Your mother in law's wedding! Gianni, let him take goodbye from his friends! Yes, dear, you are right. And you think about your mother in law! Ernesto, it seems they got stucked us! More than this!
