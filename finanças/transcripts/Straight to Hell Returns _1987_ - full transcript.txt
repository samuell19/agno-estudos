What's the difference?You know, you look exactly like a kid Norwood hung the other day. That was my brother. Norwood, it's me! It's Velma! Come out! There's somebody who wants to shoot you! I didn't say that! [screams] Frank, cover me! [Willy] Simms, I think I'm gonna die. Louise tried to kill me, man. [panting] I thought she loved me. Hey, Willy, baby. [screaming] It's all right. It's all right, Willy. [groaning] Oh, shut up, Willy. [Willy] It hurts. It hurts! Wait up! Slow down. If I ever make it out of here alive, I swear I'll never kill again. Look, it's the preacher. He's running away. That coward. Let's kill him. [gunfire] Die!Hypocrite! [man] Let's get outta here. I know you did it, Sabrina. Did what? Killed Grandpa. What would I want to do that for? Because you're "shikso", just like me. It's all right. [whimpering] But, Mom... [sobbing] Oh, never mind, Chuck. [speaking Spanish] No, you cops will have to use rocks. Let's go.Where? Don't ask questions.Okay. To the front line. Excuse me. Are you Mac McMahon? Who wants to know? I hear you're quite the poet. [chuckles] Well, thanks. I'm flattered. Would you like to hear a poem?

Luckily, he showed us where this money is though. Before he died. Give me a hand, brother. [grunting] Give me a hand up, brother. You're wounded, Willy. You're not gonna make it. -Yes, I am. -Uh-uh. What're you doing? Simms, no! Mercy killing. [panting] [gun cocks] [Velma laughing] Ah! [sobbing] [laughing] Simms?What, Willy? Never thought we'd end up this way. Me neither. Still... we mustn't grumble. [whispering] High five's lookin' funny. [choking] Come on, come on! [laughing] [laughing, chattering] Come on, boys, let's go. [Norwood] Gettin' hot back here. [clicks] Norwood, don't ruin the suit. [policeman laughing] We cops always hated him anyway. [laughing] I love you, Velma. I love you too, Frank. We got it made, huh? New town, new family. We're on a roll, Frank. Nothing can stop us now. -Brake! -What's wrong? [both screaming] [Velma screaming] Coming with us? Nope. You sure? Hey! Who's gonna pay for all that?
