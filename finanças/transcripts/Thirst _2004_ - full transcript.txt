Shukri! I'm exhausted. I want to go to school. That rotten dog betrayed me! Hurry up! Bring some dirt! Hurry, cover it up! How will we get water now? I'm fed up. I want tap water like everyone else. I'm exhausted. THIRST We'll manage with 2 buckets till the pipe is built. I don't want to drink. You prefer your damn school to me! I had an exam. I'm more important! No school tomorrow. You'll replace the wood. You destroyed the tank in anger. Enough! Use your brain. How long will we stay here? We could rent a house anywhere with this money. We can't stay here forever. You think he'll let you finish school? He wants to build pipes and tie us down... Including you. I'm a man. I can leave. A man for whom? It's too late for the oldest. But what about the young one? Answer me. Don't turn your back to me. It's not fair for Shukri and Halima. They deserve this money more, don't they? Please forget about laying these pipes. Who spilled that? Maybe the sheep. I discovered that when I woke up. Two buckets aren't enough. We can't stay without water. Shukri! Come fetch water. Fill it up. It stinks! We'll boil it. Carry this. It tastes good! Come with me. I'd like to change my shirt. Stay here. We're leaving. We'll wait for Shukri. So you are living here... How come they let you? Who's "they"? I live on my land. "You're fucking with an ancient dick". Sorry to say it. This land was confiscated 50 years ago. Got contacts with the Israeli government? Drive! From the nearest water source, it's 200 to 250 meters. If we dig a hole there, it's still 100 meters to the house. Are you crazy? That's not how I see it! It will take more materials. It will cost a lot. I've got money. But if someone denounces you, they'll destroy it and kick you out. I've been here 10 years. Why should they do it now? The pipe will alert them. I can always ask someone else... Come back to town. Use this money to rent a house and live normally. Life has changed. People mind their own business. There's no more gossip about your daughter. Today, people know she was molested. It's not her fault. Think of your children. It would be a pity. Stay out of this. Let's talk business or I'll find someone else. If you wish. I'm out of breath. What's wrong? It doesn't work. It's not fitting. Since when are you a plumber? Forget it. He'll fix it. I'm almost done. It tastes like metal. It still smells good. It's 11 years old. He used to like perfume. Want some? It's like alcohol... The older, the better. Come on, it's really good! What's that? It doesn't work. I'll fix it. The ranger's car... Hide! Fast! Dad... Dad... I hear a car coming. They'll see the tractor. They'll take it. And us, too. You rented it. I know nothing. Let's save one of us. Tell them that. It's an airplane... We'll store the charcoal here. But we need a door. Happy with the water? Yes. You don't look it. What should I do? What do your mother and sisters say? Nothing. Women are never satisfied. If you're nice, they want you mean and vice versa. A vicious circle. Damn the man who trusts women. Take it away from your mouth! Shukri! The pipe burst. Tell them to bring breakfast here. The soldiers surely did it. Or those who drive around in jeeps. "Keren Kayemet" (The land authority). What a waste... Not worth even building it. We'll fix it. Want to leave us penniless? Should we starve to have water? Plus, winter is coming. You want to just abandon it? What if it breaks again? We'll guard it day and night. Shukri and I will do night shifts. What about school? No need. He learned more than enough. Here, 300. Plus, 100 kilos of charcoal. What for? Feast is coming. I won't barbecue for the whole town! Just pay me later. No. I'll help you sell the charcoal. Help him load it. What do you think? It's okay, but it should be facing the pipes? Know what this is? A gun. It's a "Government", used by American officers. Is it yours? It's worth 8000 but I could get as much as 10,000. Want to sell it? Fool. Can't live without it today. Feel it. You could defend the both of us. Hold it like this... Your fingers here. Careful, it's loaded. - Can I? - Not here. I'll let you try later. Isn't it great? Can I use it to guard the pipe? Could you shoot someone? I never tried. Do you think I did it for my sake? It's for you and Shukri. Do you want to stay here? Keep silent... It's better. I found batteries. I'll fix the radio. What's that book you're always carrying? "A lonely man is a saint. "A woman makes him a devil. "Counting your days is counting your heartbeats. "Regretting your past beauty, "is like driving forward while looking backwards. "The world's beauty is fading and vanishing. "I heard this truth from a mute." I got burnt. I'll ride the donkey to school. Did you ask your father? No. Go now, then. Where's your donkey? Who did you fight with? Tell me! Kids at school. Beat you up and took your donkey! There were 10 of them. I didn't run. Stay home with the women if you can't fight back. Shukri! What do you want from me? I wish you were dead! Leave me alone! "The Middle East in Modern History" You're smoking again? You still have it? - Throw it away. - For God's sake! It's useless. It doesn't shoot. Should I try it on you? The Aid El Kebir feast is in 2 days. Why not make your daughters happy? Let them celebrate like the others. Buy them new clothes, like everyone else. I don't have any money. When will you have some? You spent it all on that pipe. God forgive you. How sad for Shukri... Stop hinting around. Say what you want! Let him keep going to school. What for? In the end, his place is here. He'll have no other choice, even if he became a professor. Do we have a choice? How long will we steal trees? What if you or Shukri is arrested? Who'll take care of us then? That's life. It's a battle. We battle one another. At least let Shukri go and live his own life. Where can he go? Wait for Shukri. Take him with you. "The Whore's Brother" Ask your donkey to take you. What's written? The Whore's Brother. Wait son, I'll wash it away. Halima, come with me. Give me a knife. You want to hit me? Do it. Go ahead, if you're a man! I don't hit girls. What do you know about me? Back then you were just a kid. Your father gave me this bad reputation. He ran away. He couldn't face them. Don't be like him. Grow up and make them respect you. What respect? I quit school because of gossip about you. Don't be a coward like him. I could have left long ago. I'll be 30 soon. Just wasting away here. What's that? Your name: Amal. It's written like that? Show me. Write it again. You can do it. A... M... Another A, like the first one. AMA... Writing is great. God forgive my father, he never sent me to school. What's wrong with the radio? It needs batteries. A battery would be enough? From where? Come, I'll give you one. He keeps everything locked up. But we can use it. Why are you so scared? Go on. Come in. It's great! Come and try! Oh God... It's wonderful. Come and see! Let's enjoy it! That's great! There's even a TV! Turn it on. Show me how it works. You look like a professor. Father must have fun here. Will this do? Look at yourself! Isn't it beautiful? Yes it will do. Light me a cigarette. Open your mouth. I bought you new clothes. That's for you. What do I need new clothes for? Look what I brought you. Like the one when you were 17. Remember? I guessed your size. Try it on. Let's see how it looks. For whom should I dress up? For me. You're neither my lover nor my husband. Just put it on! Look at yourself... You're pathetic. Go ahead and kill me. Water! Quick! - No water! - Forget the charcoal, fire's too strong! Hurry up! Use dirt! Bring dirt... More dirt! Hurry! Mummy! Don't be scared, darling. Don't be scared, darling. Try and stand up. Don't be scared. Slowly, put it on the hinges. Screw it from inside. Weren't you supposed to sell the charcoal instead of moving it? We have nothing left to eat. We still have some "molokhia". Our stomachs are growing roots. Check in the fields tomorrow. There's nothing left. Try and find something. And Gamila? I don't want her anymore. Gamila! Where are you, my beloved daughter! Gamila! Answer me, dear daughter! "The Ingenius" by Muhammad Shukri "Dear Gamila, "I'm sick of Egypt and Egyptians. "I long to be back with you all. "Your mother loves Cairo even if she looks angry in the photo." I forgot the knife. Who needs a knife? Don't you want to look for her? She'll come back on her own. Listen... If you keep acting this way, I am with my children. Dad! Dad! Am I not your beloved? Pity me. What did I do wrong? Open the door, dad. I'm your beloved daughter. I learned my lesson. Gamila... Answer me, please! I'm your mother. I brought you water. Gamila! Go on playing. Won't you let her out? She didn't do anything. She came back, after all. Release her. That's enough. What are you doing? Stop it! I want to free her! Go keep guard the pipe. Take the hammer with you. Now you can die happy. Don't you want to? Aren't you scared of me? Who else could scare you? Everyone is scared of me. You should be scared, too. I'll shoot. Hear me? Shoot! Shoot! Shoot, bastard! Shoot!
