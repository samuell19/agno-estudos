Murder. It's one of those things you don't ever get used to. It don't matter how many times you do it or why, it... ...puts your gut in a vice every time. I've cashed in enough blood-soaked paychecks to know. I also know... I'm gonna have to pay for what I done. You're gonna tell me. You're gonna tell me? I can't save you! You're gonna fucking tell me! Tell me! Tell me! - Tell me! - God! Who?! Who?! Who?! I shit... I shit... I shit my pants. - Who...? Who else? - I shit my pants. Where? Where? Where?! Where?! Get it out. Can't handle this, you say so now. It's fucked up. No one's saying it ain't. But it just saved lives. This is a live watch, and I got gunfire coming from inside this fucking room. - Get him out of here! - What the fuck? What'd you do here? I'm having you brought up on charges. I'm having you charged! Don't leave! Don't leave me. Don't leave me here! No! No! Fuck you! You wanna meet your daughter, or what? What's wrong with her? Why is she in a chair? You kidding me? You didn't read my letters? Doesn't matter. Would you have done anything different anyway? Well, how'd it happen? That's your daughter. Are you gonna go say hi or you gonna stare at her and make her feel weird? Go ahead. Hey. Remember we talked about how your father went over to the war? Yeah. Know who this is? Hi. How you doing? Good. So, I'm your dad I guess? Yeah. Wanna give your father a hug? No. Her hands are cold. I got this of you. Know who this is? Yeah. Me as a baby. You got bigger. What are those? They're medals. How do you get 'em? You get 'em when you do something good. Did you do something good? No. Not really. I'm good. Yeah. Here. Who's there? I've got a gun in here. Ma, it's me, DD. My God! My God! I thought you said you wasn't coming home till Friday. I wanted to surprise you. Baby! Ooh! You did! You did! I'm all right. We so proud of you. What's up, my man? 'Sup. Damn, how tall are you now? I don't know, like 5'9". You still playing ball? Nah, they shut down the courts and took the rims. - What? - Kids was getting shot. I didn't want him going down there anymore. Heard you got capped. Come on. Let's go inside. It's getting cold out here. Come on. Go inside. Go inside! Where the money at now? Where the money at now? You have to tell me a bedtime story. A bedtime story? What about? You gotta make it up. All right. Um... There was a... No. You have to start with "Once upon a time." Once upon a time. She asleep? Yeah. I'm sorry. You left me here pregnant and alone. I'm sorry. Fuck you, Tommy! ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Glory, glory ♪ ♪ Blessed be the rock ♪ ♪ Blessed be the rock ♪ ♪ Blessed be the rock ♪ ♪ Blessed be the rock ♪ You think you bad now? OK! I'm done! OK, I'm done. - All right. - I'm done, I'm done. OK. Man. So, what's it like? - What, Iraq? - Yeah, you know, war. People shoot at you and shit? Yeah, people shot at me. Some people spit at me. Some people thanked me. So, how many you got? - Got what? - How many A-rabs you kill? - Yo! - Come on. How many you got? - You don't ask me that. - You mean to tell me you ain't got nobody? Smiley's brother came back, said he got 15 motherfuckers. Stop. It's not what you think it is, all right? It's fucked up out there, James, for real. You gotta get some of that bullshit out your head, man. I'm talking about here, too. It's not a novelty. It's a tragedy. Ten hut! My brother! Motherfucking war hero! Damn, look at you, man! Damn, good to have you back, man! Good to be back. So they make a man out of you over there or what, boy? Yo, how'd you know I was here? Man, I figured this be the first place Ma drag you to soon as you got back. Yo. I know what you need. And it sure as fuck ain't another dude with a beard, you dig me? Man! Yo, it is good to have you back, man. Man! Damn. James, go wait for me in the car. How you doing, Ma? Boy, I said go wait for me in the car. - This is some bullshit. - Watch your mouth. - I asked you before... - Ma. Look, look. I'll be in the car, man. Good to see you, too, Ma. What was that? He's our brother. He sells poison to kids younger than James. - Yeah, you heard me! - Ma! Darren, I realize you a grown man. And I know he's your brother. But James is my son, and I will not have him mixed up in this nonsense. I'll be home later. Don't wait up. Be careful. I'll be fine. I will wait up. D. You sure I'm all right wearing this down here? Little brother, you ain't got nothing to worry about down here. Come on, man. Shit. Open up, bitch. - What's happening, B? - Same shit, different toilet. This is my brother, DD. He just got back from Iraq. Welcome home. So who's been by? Maurice been by, picked up. Johnny Mags, picked up. Cracks Man, dropped off, and we still waiting on Toucan Sam. Toucan ain't back by dark, follow your nose, and bring him to me. Come on. Check this out. Wait a second! Why'd you bring me here? What you talking about? This is exactly why Ma don't want you near James. - D. - Do me a favor, open the door. Look, a lot of shit done changed since you been gone. Open the fucking door! What the fuck, man?! We been hustling since we were kids! That was dime bags of weed, not that shit! Don't you turn your back to me, man! What you gonna do?! After all Ma's been through trying to get rid of that shit, you just tearing down everything she worked for. Don't you fucking judge me, man. You ain't been around! You forgot what it's like down here! Yeah, I do what I gotta do. But nobody take better care of this neighborhood better than I do, man! You are not the solution, Darnell, you're the problem! So, what you got? I mean, what you did was all honorable and all that shit. So, what you got, man?! Other than the fucking hole in your chest. D. D, hold up, man. Hold up, man! You know, D, you're my brother. And I love you. Don't you ever in your fucking life put your hands on me again. You hear me? You hear me? Hold up, man. Fuck, man. Just hang on, man. I ain't taking that. Look, it ain't a gift. It's yours. Just take it before you go. Ma said you pawned it. I did. I got it back. Get up. Get up! Bernie's here. He's outside. Fuck me. How long has he been there? I don't know. When did you see him? I just... I looked outside, he was there. How'd he know I was here? Shit. Go upstairs with Hope. There's something I gotta tell you. Tell me later. There he is. Home from fulfilling his patriotic duty. - Been awhile. - Not long enough. Let me ask you something. Did they make you kill people? How'd you know I was here? Nothing gets by me, kid. You know that. You know I'm out. Yeah, I heard these things. But kid, people like us don't just retire. It's in our blood. White cells, red cells, sickle cells, and this shit. It's biological. And you ain't fightin' it. Tell you what. You consider this a blood donation then. You look like you could use one anyway. Kid, I wanted your blood, I'd just take it. Whatever loyalty I had, don't exist no more. That's not my life. But you come around here again, and I'll make an exception. I come down here to have a friendly chat. No, it's been awhile, so I'll pretend you didn't just say that. Now, unless you wanna wake up the entire neighborhood, get in the fucking car. You ever known me to ask twice? Get the fuck outta here. Take a walk with me, OK? Jake, you go in. Get him started. You know, some shit changes, and some shit don't. This town, this town's changed more in the last five years than the 20 before it. A whole different place now, different rules. When we had control up here, it was a decent place to live. Germans down on one side, Irish down the other. Of course, the guineas, they always had the south. And the muscle. But they never fucked with us, you know, not up here. Sure you heard stories from your father. - Fuck my father. - Hey! Your father was a good man. He took care of you the only way he knew how. Look, you do what you do. God bless. But I don't want this, not no more. No, Tommy, don't you realize this whole town could be yours. What the fuck am I gonna do with this town? It can rot as far as I'm concerned. You see this neighborhood? It's because of what I do that decent people are still able to live here. I provide what the cops can't. You know what this block would be without me? Now, you know my methods, and I know it's a hard thing to accept, but believe me, Tommy, what I do here, it's a necessary evil. What do you want, an award? Congrats. What the fuck do you want from me? I want you to help me take back our neighborhood. Christ, you ain't hearin' me. No, no, I brought you up, I took care of you, I took care of your family! Don't you talk about my family. - You owe me! - I don't owe you shit! You're an old man. You missed the boat. You're gonna die poor. That ain't my problem. You understand me? Tommy. She didn't tell you, did she? Fuck you. Tell me what? Tell me what? When your father died, I stepped up. And when you left, while you were gone, I stepped up again. It's your turn now. What were you thinking?! You know what this means? It means I'm in his pocket! - What was I supposed to do? - Not take it! I wouldn't have had to if you had been here to provide for your own family! You were on my insurance! I sent you checks every month! Your insurance. Your insurance. I'll tell you about your insurance. Claim denied. Claim denied! Claim denied! I had a sick daughter and you weren't here, so don't dare tell me what I should have done! You have any idea what this means for me? If you can't deal, leave. If you leave, don't ever come back. Stop! Stop! Wait! Wait! Wait! Stop! Stop! You know me! ...fucking respect! Had a bit of an incident. Easy, easy. Bern, there's a couple bodies need cleanin'. What the fuck you think you're doing coming in here like this? You didn't tell me I was bad blood! You watch where you are! This ain't fucking the Marines! You pull shit like this with me again, I'll take your hands and feet and leave you squirmin' in a fucking Dumpster! Don't ever forget what I'm capable of! Sit! These rat-fuck cocksuckers can't put aside their differences for the common interest? Fuck 'em. They wanna burn bridges... ...I'll burn their houses down. Now... Is there something needs cleaning up? Same place I sent you? Anybody see anything, hear anything? No. Gunshots. Normal for that neighborhood. No one saw you coming, going? No. OK, then. Go home. OK? Have yourself a nice dinner with Faith. But make sure she knows you've been there all night. Jake, I want you to go up and hang out by the bar, let people see you. I'll tell Nick you been there all night. I don't want you two worrying about this. I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Yo, five, five. Jimmy, come on. Let's go. Fuck is this nigga, man. - Come on, we going home. - No, nigga. He with us. Open your mouth, bitch! - Open your motherfucking mouth! - Come on, man. He's my brother, man! No, man, chill! Chill, man. It's Darnell's brother. - Chill. - Sha, come on, man, chill. - Get the fuck off of me! - Sha, come on, man. Chill, man. He's my brother, man. Stop, man, come on. You lucky, motherfucker. What is this? What is this?! This is people's lives! What you got? You ain't got shit! You don't even got a car! You a punk! Murder. It's one of them things you don't ever get used to. It don't matter how many times you do it or why, it puts your gut in a vice every time. I've cashed in enough blood-soaked paychecks to know. I also know I'm gonna have to pay for what I done. So I keep reminders. Cops call 'em trophies. I do this so when the devil comes knocking on my door I know exactly what I owe him. Old man wants to see you. What's up? I need something done. I know it's a bad time. But I need it done just the same. I swear to God, if there's Irish in there, I'm not doing it. I will drink with the fucking enemy before I kill an Irishman on St. Patty's. What's that? Every time you get a job, that comes out. It was supposed to be a different life. The man who give it to me was sort of a minister. He helped people escape the IRA in Belfast. He was a good man. A true man. So he give me this ring and he said it's my chance to change. All I had to do was put it on. Like a commitment. A symbol. All I had to do was wear it. I never wore it. Not once. Sorry I'm late. I got held up. They won't let me go in again, and she don't wanna go by herself. So, what I gotta do? Just talk to her. Keep her calm. OK, I can do that. What happened? You're bleeding. It's nothing. Jesus Christ, Tommy. - You smell like turpentine. - It's St. Patty's. You sure you're up for this? Yeah, I'm good. I'm good. Go eat something first. I can't hear them. My ears are clogged. Go like this. You hear the poppin'? Yeah. Daddy? Are you gonna leave? No. I'm not leaving. Do you love me? Yeah. I do. Yeah? No, no, you listen. Now, I got some shit getting ready to blow up in my face. My guy's tied to this double homicide over on Clearfield. It's got Charlie Burns all over it. No good. I can't get near it. No, no, you make a case! Look, if this comes down on me, I'm pulling out. I want my family protected. You better fucking back me up. You knew what you were getting into. If it gets too hot, we'll deal with it. Right now, I need eyes on Charlie Burns from your side. I'll let you know when I got something. Yeah? Whiskey? Yeah. How you doing? I'm Darren. You got a cool place here, sir. Enjoy your evening. I... I play the sax. I play the sax, Mr. Jackson. Look, son, I'm not auditioning. You picked a shit time to come at me, so enjoy your drink. Enjoy the music and enjoy the evening. I knew Jack, sir. We were stationed together. Sorry if I'm out of line coming here like this, but... he told me to come see you when I got back. Sir, I don't have a lot of options. Come on. You got five minutes. Impress me. So my dad, the drunk bastard, he owed money all over town. Never paid his debts. He had two fingers missing on each hand. People used to call him Johnny Stubs. He'd get plastered, bookies would catch him in a stupor, threaten him, chop his fingers off for not paying 'em. Greatest landlord, Quincy fucking Jones. Cocksucker was also one of my dad's bookies. He got so tired of chopping off my dad's fingers and my dad not paying him, he said, "Tonight, I'm gonna chop off your prick if you don't pay up." So, my dad is fucked, right? He's in a gutter, he can't borrow a dime. He gets a note and he writes, "Fuck you, Quincy." And he staples it to his chest. Right here, right? So I'm a young lad, about ten. I happen to walk into the room. I see my dad on the couch, his rifle under his chin, his toe on the trigger. I said, "Dad, no!" And I run over, knock the fucking gun out of his hand. Bang! Goes off into the ceiling. My dad's fine. Upstairs, we hear... The landlord bookie lived in the apartment above us. What? I swear to Christ. The bullet went right through the fucking ceiling, cut him under the chin, blew off the top of his fucking melon. So now my dad's ecstatic, right? But now he's gotta dispose of the body. And this fucker weighed like a fucking truck. You know? So he goes out through the backyard, digs a hole, wasn't the smartest bastard, goes upstairs, lugs this big fucker down the steps, out the back, takes the body right up to the fucking hole. All of a sudden, my dad takes a heart attack, goes right into the fucking hole. Both of them, plop, into the fucking hole. That was the first time I ever killed a man. - Two men, one shot. - So, what'd you... So, what'd you do? I did as me ma said. I covered them with dirt and I planted a garden. Jesus Christ. You're such a psycho. Your cherry was no easy-breezy. I seem to remember cleaning vomit out me car that one fine evening. We all got our first, right? Too late now. What? I... I never... What the fuck you talking about? He's a virgin. You ain't never... Under our noses? Yeah. What the fuck you doing here? Get out while you can. Look at us. We're a bunch of mutts bred into this shit by our scumbag fathers. You don't want this, trust me. No, we got work. Bern didn't say nothing about going out. Not you. Us. Don't need you tonight, Tommy. I got my boy, John, you know? Maybe tonight, John will bust his cherry? Do me a favor. Lock up when you leave. What's the matter? What happened? I founded it this morning. It's more than I've got in the bank. Where'd he get it from? You know where he got it. I'm losin' another son. No. No, I'm here now. That's not gonna happen. I won't let it happen. Listen to me. No. I'll handle this. Open the fucking door! I need to see my brother. Come on in. Who the fuck is that? Says he's the brother. Welcome. Darren, right? Little Jimmy! Maybaleen. With the exception of that piece of shit over there, you got a pretty nice looking family. What do you want? Too much. I'm a greedy bastard, and I'll be the first to admit it, but I get what I want. Who are you? I'm a guy don't mind making sacrifices. You see, I've been doing this a long time, and sacrifices never bothered me. Know why? Because I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck about your nigger brother, I don't give a fuck about your nigger family, I don't give a fuck about how long they scream when I cut open their stomachs. Fuck you! Fuck your family. You got six days. What does he want? - I'm sorry. - What'd you do? What'd you do?! What did you do?! - I'm sorry, man! - Shut up! Shut up! You brought our family into this?! You brought our family into this. You're not my friend. You're not my brother! You ain't my family! You go near James again, I'll kill you myself. D, I'll help you with this. But when this is done, so are you and me. I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Looking for this? - You're not my father! - Fuck what I am! - You smoke this shit? - No! - Do you smoke this shit?! - No, I ain't stupid! No, but you sell it! What about this? You think you know about this? You think this shit makes you tough? You think this makes you a man? Everything you think you know about this is bullshit. It's an illusion. It ain't real. I seen a lot of kids with guns thought they was tough. I also seen 'em crying like babies when they got shot. I killed a lot of people, James. I killed a lot of women. I killed a lot of children, to know how brutal and ugly and disgusting this is. It's a fucked up world we live in, bro. And if you don't open your eyes and see it for what it is, you're gonna get stuck. Just like our brother. What you need, dawg? Look at me. Look at me! You remember me? - You know my brother, Jimmy? - Yeah! Wrong answer! You don't know him, you never seen him. You see my brother Jimmy, you walk the other fucking way. No, no, no. You put wheels on it, it's a truck. No. No. How about a bank? No. The unemployment office. You have to wait. OK. I give up. What is it? An ice cream shop. An ice cream shop. Yeah. And now I need the ice cream. You're sneaky, you know that? You're just like your mother. ♪ Ice cream You scream ♪ ♪ We all scream for ice cream ♪ No. All right. Let me see what we got. Ice cream, ice cream, ice cream, ice cream. I scream, we all scream. Ice cream. - You OK? - Yeah. I'm good. You know, I didn't think that plant had a chance. I was, thinking... ...about us. And, was wondering... - Yeah. Need you to come in for a meetin'. Soon as you can get here. All right, I'll be right over. - He in back? - Yeah, he's back there. We came in here on good faith. I'm not a thug, I got no beef with you, man! I'm just trying to help my family! - Bern. - Not now. Not here. D! D, come on! Come on, man! - Get outta here! - Who the fuck was that? Suicide victims. Wait! Jesus! I almost fucking shot ya! You gotta get me out! It's too hot! Hang tight for now, and we'll figure this out. If I stay in, I'm a corpse! Are you saying you can't handle it? I'm saying it's fucked! I did my job! Six months I've been in and I ain't seen my wife in a week! - We have no case. - We've got a fucking case. - On Darnell Davis? - I can't get to Burns. - The fuck you want from me? - You don't have to get Burns. All right? You can do this from your side. You know what? I don't give a fuck what you gotta do. I want out and I want my family protected. - I can't do that now. - I'm risking my life! You knew what this job was! You weren't assigned, you volunteered! Now, I'm not gonna compromise a seven-month investigation 'cause you got spooked. This shit happens. It's what we do. You get me something we can use, and I'll do everything in my power. Go call your wife. Let her know you're OK. You look so handsome. Thank you. I am so proud of you. - So proud. - Do me a favor. Make sure James is good to go. I'll be right down, OK? All right. James? 'Sup, man? How'd you get back here? I just, just wanted to... - You're on in five minutes. - All right, I'll be right up, OK? I just wanted to let you know that everything is taken care of. I didn't want you out there worrying about it. - All right, good. - All right. Look, do me a favor. What? What's up? Exit out the back. Mom's here with James, and I don't 'em seeing you. All right? Yeah. Good evening, Philly. Thanks for coming out. We have a newly acquired sax with us tonight. So let's give it up for Darren Davis. Thank you. Thanks for coming out. This is called "Cost of a Soul." Ever think about the... ...cost to all this? What the fuck you think I'm doing? No, the cost of what we do. What are you talking about? The things we've done. You mean, like, retribution? Karma or some shit? Shit, man. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, man. I'm just tired. I just been thinking too damn much. You're right. About what you were saying, this shit here. What we do. It don't come without a cost. What you saying? I'm saying... You got a family? You got something. You don't want to be doing this shit the rest of your life. And there are ways out. I don't think you realize what the fuck you sound like. But you better say exactly what it is you trying to tell me. Yo, lock this shit behind me. Don't be watching TV all night. - Cops just fucking shot D! - Shit. Drop the gun. Put it down. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say... you say can... ...can be used... ...against you. No. No. No. Don't... don't... Don't... don't... don't... Don't... Don't... don't... Don't! - Hell of a show. - Thanks. - What's wrong? - James is gone. Something's wrong. All right, look. Just go home. I'll meet you there later, all right? Think I know where he went. Mom! Go home! Grab him! Grab him! Come on. Where's my brother?! What the fuck?! My God. What happened? Shit! Shit! We have to get you to the hospital! - No hospitals. - No, no, no. No, listen. No hospitals. OK. Shh. Hold pressure on it, OK? You should have seen the other guy, right? He was a cop. What do you mean? What do you mean a cop? I killed him. - And I killed a kid. - Stop. That's what I do. I kill people. - Tonight I killed a kid. - Stop! I'm sorry, Ma. I'm... I'm sorry! I'm sorry! You've been out all day. I want it out of my house. It's not your fault. I, gotta go get some more of this stuff. You all right if I leave her with you? Hi. Yeah, it's fine. I'll be back in a little. Take care of your dad. Eat something. What happened? Yeah, I'm here. If you ain't dead yet, why the fuck haven't I heard from you? - It went really bad. - Yeah, I know. I had to find out this morning from Connie Chung on Channel 6. This something we can handle? My blood's there. Look, you put me in a real big fucking mess. I don't know... I'll try to pull something out. Tommy. Tell me, you didn't find anything, did ya? No. You sure about that? No, it wasn't there. Lay low for awhile. Stay in the house. Don't let anyone see you. I'll be in touch. How does it feel? I can live with it. Of course you can live with it. But can you die with it? All right. We're gonna go for a little ride. All right? Stay right there. You got it? You OK? All right. - OK. Good. - Where's Mommy? You're gonna go see Mommy right now. Been a change of plans, OK? I'm gonna talk to my friends for a little while. - OK. - And then we're gonna go, OK? All right. Love you. I didn't wanna talk over the phone. You think it's a good idea, you coming here, Bern? Well... ...yeah, I wanna go over a few things. You gonna let us in or we're gonna freeze our balls off? It's not a good time. I got my daughter here. Regardless, we still need to talk. Like I said, it ain't a good idea. You ain't that quick, kid. - Faith here? - She stepped out. Check upstairs. Why don't you get rid of it so we can talk. Let's go somewhere else. You want bullets whizzing around your little girl here? Give me the gun. Come on. All right. All right. All right, you got me. Where is it?! Daddy? It's OK, honey. We're just talking. She doesn't see this. It don't belong to you no more. Bern. Bern, get her outta here. Take her outside, Bern. Jake, you take her outside. Leave her. Jake, take her outside. She's a fucking kid. - Get in the car! - Jake, get her outta here! It's not like she's gonna talk. I mean, look at her. What? I'm setting an example here. - You wanna be part of it? - She's a little kid! - Just let me... - Get in the car! Get in the fucking car! - She's a fucking kid! - Now! Goddamn you! Don't you leave, Jake. Fuck! Jake, no! Don't you leave, Jake! Don't you leave, Jake! Jake! Jake, we don't do this! She's a little girl, Bern. She's just a little girl. No, Bern, look. You got me. OK. OK, you got me. You helped me set a lot of examples, kid. And now you're one. Just take her outta here, OK? Just take her out of here. Bern, wait! Bern, listen to me! Listen to me! You don't have to do this! You got me! No! No! Bern, no, you got me! You got me! She's just a little girl, Bern! - Goodbye! - No! No! Please! Please, don't do this! Don't hurt her! Don't hurt my baby! Don't you fucking hurt my baby! Don't you fucking hurt my baby! No! You fuck! You fuck! You fuck! I'll kill you! Take her outside, Bern! Bern! No! She's OK. How could they do that with her there? We're not safe here. Ma, you gotta eat something. You know who did it. I want him dead. Let's just go. Let's just... leave. Get out. Get out for good. He'd find us. I'm sorry. Not here. We'll take a ride. I'm sorry. I want your word. Say it. They'll be fine. It's the right thing. Keep your mouth shut. And take care of her. Hey. I gotta go away for a little while. You said... you said you weren't leaving. You be good. Keep that fucking gun on him. He tries anything, shoot him in the gut. Nothing personal, Tom. Go fuck yourself. Yeah. Yeah, I got him. 606. Who was that? Sit back! Jake. Who just called, Jake? - Jake? - Your daughter won't be touched. I promise you that. It's the best I could do. - Sit the fuck back! - Jake. We don't do this. She ain't gonna say nothing. She knows better. I'm not fighting here, you got me. OK? - Just call it off! What do you want me to do, Jake? I'm sorry. I truly am. I wish it were different. Just keep the fucking gun on him. Sit back! Jake? Fuck. May God forgive us for our actions. Go to your father's house. I'll call you when it's safe. All right? Get outta here. I see you found it. It's yours, anyway. I'm giving it back to you. I don't want it no more. Kid...
