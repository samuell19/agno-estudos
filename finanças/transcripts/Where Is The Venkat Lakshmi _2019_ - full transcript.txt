[music mutes voices] [tires screeching] Dear, think about it once again. [cicadas chirping] Why do we need quarrels with Veera Reddy? He is very dangerous person. [screaming] [electricity crackling] [panting] [tires screeching] [thunders] [thunders] [thunders] -Hey, pick him up. -Okay, brother. Hey, get up man. [thunders] Hey, Ranga Nath... [thunders] What man? You use to done bad things along with me, then what happened suddenly? I thought of doing good now. Hey, after a person borns he should live eighter doing good, or doing bad. That's it but if he thinks of jumping one after the other, nature will not accept. Leave it. This is your last chance. Think over. Instead of dying every day in humiliation of committing sins, it's better dying in satisfaction that I died doing good. [laughing] I gave you life, And now I gave you life line too. As you are saying you don't need so, [thunders] I will only take your life. [metal rod splash] Dear! [thunders] [sobbing] -That box is inside the car bring it. -Okay, brother. [metal rod splash] Dear... [chuckles] [sobbing] Don't cry, why are you feeling sad? [sobbing] Oh, your husband would not live with you right? [screams] Looks like your spin is fractured. [sobbing] That means you are useless to me too. There was a method in olden days for the people like you, There used to be a practice called Sati. Shall we perform it? [sobbing] [thunders] WHERE IS THE VENKATALAKSHMI [birds chirping] [bicycle bell rings] [vehicle honks] [tires screeching] Take it. Ticket.

In my village beautiful mountains, -mother goddes temple, cinema halls... -Stop. Stop. In a way how eyes, nose, mouth and ears are for a face, similarly, these things are pretty much common in every village. Tell me one thing present in your village which is not present in other villages. then I will agree that your village is special. It would not work out if I didn't say anything interesting. -There is one thing. -Huh? There is one thing present in your village which is not present in other villages. Chanti and Pandu. But they are two persons right? Yes, but they both are one. How is that possible? Do you know how it would be if creatures of hell are born on earth? No! [chuckles] They are Chanti and Pandu. Why the hell are all the aunties coming to the roads? [chuckles] [bicycle bell rings] Satyavathi, are you bathing? Damn! Get lost. [chuckles] [chuckles] -Hey, Chanti! -Yes? I am hungry dude. -Are you feeling hungry? -Yes. Can't you wait till we have lunch? I am telling that I am hungry that means to feel me it's not about waiting. -Is it? -Yes. Then come. Thank god! Chicken curry is prepared. -Kantam... -Kantam... What guys, why did you come here? What are you cooking Chicken curry? Smell is coming till the road. Hey... As today is my husband's birthday, I have cooked a little amount out of love. How can a person who is born today digest chicken curry, Kantam? You have to offer food to celebrate a birthday. -It's not like that... -What should we do? Hey, I will beg you guys... [laughs] I will cook it again if you need. [groans] Please listen to me. Hey, I am saying to you only. Hey! No man. [indistinctive voice] Oh god! My Chicken curry. Stop. Stop... we have reached home. Ah!

Paparao, happy birthday man. Happy birthday. Same to you man. [laughs] Hey, Pandu and Chanti! "Chicken curry was great" "Salt and spices are in correct ratio" "All credits goes to you" -Papi... -Paparao, happy birthday man. Hey, Chanti and Pandu. -Damn! -What you are feeling bad for this? There is another story after this. [cicadas chirping] -Shall we go? -Come on. Be careful dude. -Ah? -Ah-ha. -Get down. -Okay. [chuckles] -Can we join the game? -Can we join the game? Hey, Chanti and Pandu, why are you here? -What game are you playing? -What games? Today is my first night. First night? Do you know what does it means? -Yes, I know. -Do you know? -Do you know? -No, I don't know. Then why are you playing without sleeping when you don't know come on sleep. -Sleep. -Come on sleep. [indistinctive voices] Hey! -Oh god! -Did you understand? That's the situation. They are a problem for whatever they do, it's a problem for us if we say anything. Really your village is special that your village is tolerating them. You asked about my village but, er... you haven't told anything about yourself. [chuckles] [bus honks] By the way, from which village you belong to? Hold on Nagampet. Nagampet... [bicycle bell rings] [indistinctive voices] She is going... What is that, you are going without saying anything? As you look handsome, you were roaming behind from one month so I made you sit beside. Is it? [chuckles] Excuse me, it's injustice. At least tell me your name and go. Please... [chuckles] [bicycle bell rings] -Hey, Lasya. -What? I think today it has worked out for that guy. Did that boy got passed or not? Hmm... he has passed for now. [chuckles] Hey, give me a card man. Hey, make it fast. Give me the card. Don't know whose face I saw early in the morning. I am quitting guys, I didn't get good cards. Why did he quit the game? Don't know whose face I've seen in the morning I didn't get good cards. Hey, stop your non sense first play the card. Make it fast guys. [bird chirping] Hey, play your move. [birds chirping] -Hey, Satti. -Yes? I was thinking to ask you, something dude. You are not seen near your office after 5 p. m. from past 3 days why? But like a king daily night at 9 o'clock on your 2 wheeler. Are you listening like a king, with half dozen Bananas, you are going to the three-flood gated canal, I am suspecting with my brain. -Nothing like that man. -Then? Kids aren't at home so I am going home at 5 o'clock. Oh-ho! -Damn! -I need that only show. [laughs] [indistinctive voices] -Super Chanti... -The championship goes again to Chanti. Give me the money, guys come on. Hey, how many cards do you have? Take out the money. [chuckles] I need two. Hey, Subbu... aren't you going to the city? Why man? Nothing dude, there is discount offers so, that you can bring two pairs of pants and six pairs of shirt pieces. -Make your move man. -Here it is. Hey, show! Oh no! Are you thinking is it a joke keeping 13 cards in one game? Take out the money. Take out the money, we have many works left. -Take out. -Take out the money. -Hey, Subbu. -Yes? He is not talking about clothes he is talking about the game you are playing. Oh my god! I understood now. Pandu was actually talking about our cards. I won't agree. Hey, Chanti. If you didn't give my money back I will kick you. [indistinctive voices] Hey, I will kick you. [indistinctive voices] -Sekhar. -Yes? Chanti and Pandu started fighting with everyone after cards game. Oh no! Again? -Come on. -Let's move. [chaos] Rascal! How dare you to bash me. Hey, give me my money... Hey, please give me money back... [indistinctive voices] Stop it guys. Hey, stop it guys... -Hey! -Hey, Chanti. -Please give me my money. -Hey, stop it guys. [indistinctive voices] Police! Police! Police! -Police! Police! -Police! Police! -Hey, policeman. -Hey, give me my... Police people will come. [sighs] Mix less salt in Tomato slices. It would become more while mixing them for pickle. Okay. Dear, keep each piece under the sunlight so that they can get completely dry, if not pickle would spoil. -Don't know why even Sunlight isn't... -Hey, old women... -Old woman! -What? Without any respect? Hey, you keep quite. Old woman, where are those two guys? What are you thinking? Till yesterday you use to call me madam, have you gone crazy? Yes. I thought Chanti, is on my side, but from the time he stopped supporting me why should I give respect to you and them? Ask them both to come out. Oh my god! Did you see how arrogant her mouth is? -Look, how she is talking. -Hey, tell them to come out. [panting] Thank god. They killed us. -Hey! -Yes? No police is coming. I just shouted like that. -You idiot. -Thank god. -We almost died of fear. -We almost died. Then why are you playing? You should have thought about what would happen if the police arrives. Thought? [chuckles] We don't do anything thinking before. [birds chirping] We do whatever we want to that's it. Hey, we are not in a forest to do anything we are in the village. -What I am telling is... -Stop it, man. Stop it. You are the one in this village whom we are obeying to. That was settled as it. That's it. If you eat too much sugar because of its sweetness, you would feel saturated. Similarly, if you start saying many good things thinking we will listen to you, -We'll get saturated. -Yes. By the way, did the girl you met in the bus talk to you? Yes, dude. She spoke with me a little. You are feeling very shy. -Hey, wait. -What man? How do you know that? It can be easily understood by seeing your face dude. -Is it? -Yes. Do you understand what's going on seeing their faces? -We can understand many things. -Is it? What are those? -Now... -Yes? A persons face who is hungry would be in different type. The one whose cannot digest the food his face would be different. In cards game when one person is going to win the game his face would be different. The one who is going to lose the game his face would be in a different way. When a guy falls in love it would be in a way. That guy who fell in love if his love got successful it would be in another way. -Keeping a woman... -Hey, stop it. -Stop it guys. -Okay. You guys are not normal. [chuckles] You who knows these many things could do anything. -Hey, stop it, dude. -No need dude. Hey, Chanti and Pandu. [bicycle bell rings] That Subbalakshmi is making nuisance in front of your house. -Why man? -You did something it seems. -Subbalakshmi! -Subbalakshmi! -Hey! -Come on dude. [indistinctive chatter] [indistinctive chatter] What guys have you come? What Subbalakshmi, what is the nuisance here? Nuisense? Will I keep quiet if you do cheat me? I will call elder persons in the village and keep council. -Is it? -I will make justice to me. Hey, I will not leave you. What? Why are you getting high? There is nothing more to discuss dude. As she had humiliated us, we should retaliate. What you are going to show? I came here seeing everything. Is it? So you saw everything right, everything? Look at this if you have watched this before. You are showing the one which I was making the nuisance about. If it comes out it will be my advantage. I already thought that you would not bend to this one. Watch the complete video dear. What is it? When does this happen? When I gave you coconut water then you had it... That's it, in that we have mixed Chanti and Pandu's medicine. Now tell me... Madam, if you have any clothes give them to me. -I'll kick you, dirty woman! -Keep them ready. Now tell me How did I settled the matter? You useless fellows. I thought you are just doing nuisance in the house, but you are bringing the nuisance in the village to house. Oh no! Don't hit me like that. If anyone sees they would think we aren't grown yet. Why didn't you grew up? I kept grass and paddy inside the house, have it and go upon the village like cattle. Come on dude let's eat. You stop the speech and do your work. -Get lost. -Shut up! -My grandma is my dear. -Hey, my spin would get fractured. What Mr Naidu, you are wearing more gold day by day. What's the matter? -Excuse me, president greetings. -What Satti? -Why have you here wearing a torn shirt? -That Chanti and Pandu have torn off. What should I do man? Ask them to say sorry and should pay my cable bill. Hey, I will slap you. -Why should I say sorry to you? -Oh god! Did you understand in this way? I was talking about Chanti and Pandu. Look how they tore off my shirt. Mom! Look your son has come he was also present there. -He is a close friend to both of them. -Mom. -Excuse me, at least you say... -Hey! Why were you there? What is the work with them? They are my friends since my childhood, what would I say if you ask why? If I wouldn't go there his pant and inner wear would also have torn. -Ah! -Is it? [laughing] -Mom, serve me food. -Everything is ready, change your clothes, I will serve. Damn! Nothing worth here I should only do something. As if a blind horse needs the same amount of fodder like every other horse, -Have it. -Egg curry is very tasty grandma. -Yes. -Alright. Do you know because of my hand this curry is great? Ah! Why do you hit me? -How could you say that? -I was the one who brought eggs. Is it enough if you bring eggs? Moreover, you brought them with the money I earned. -You don't have shame. -Shame? What does it mean grandma? I think a new girl which came to our village dude. You don't have any figure in your village and you need a new figure. Grandma, give me one egg please. What hubby? You went to Pushkaram despite my objection. As the families of these guys got drowned in the river, you brought them here to prevent them from becoming orphans. Were you alive after bringing them? You died without teaching what is good and what is bad. I am dying here because I couldn't raise them up properly. But you... -What grandma? -What grandma? Are you feeling sad because grandfather isn't in between us? Yes, dear. [chuckles] Will do one thing, We will take you and throw you from there and you can easily go near grandfather. Will you push me down? -I will kill you... -Grandma, wait listen have one bite. -No need. -Eat one bite, -please it's egg curry. -I don't want. Have it... TV: Greetings.

[cuckoo coos] I won't believe, [crow caws] -He doesn't look like an auditor. -What sir? Don't underestimate me because I've come by walk. -My background is very big. -I will ask you one question. Ask. [crow caws] -What is the work of an auditor? -What's in it, sir? Calculating your income tax and pay tax to government. -What? -Ah... Seeing all your accounts and shouldn't pay tax to the government. [birds chirping] It's hard if a landlord like you don't have people like me. Er... sir, do you know one thing?

Greetings. -Greetings brother. -Greetings. -What? -Sir, I came to give an advance for... ...2,000 acers of coconuts. -What is the price? -Rupees four. It's high price in market sir.

I will give the market price and charges to you only. To pay what you want to pay. You should ask me. When I gave you the option, you should leave the decision to me. Take that money and your hand and move. [panting] Did you saw, if anyone acts like they are afraid, That means the one who is scaring has acted. If you really make them scared, that fear would be like this. -Did you understand? -Yes. [lighter clinks] I like him, hire him. -What does he mean? -That means he has kept you under work. If I want to quit then? If you want to quit usual death should take place or someone should kill you. He has hired you killing the auditor who used to work in your place. Ah!

We will make him scare with this. Boo! -What happened dude? -What happened? What is this Chanti? Sekhar... I know what you feel about me. But even if we meet or talk, you don't know what I feel in my heart. I even know that you are waiting to know what it is. Hey, You can understand a single word, Not with your slipper, -hit me with Subbalakshmi's slipper. -Hey, you stop. -You continue dear. -Okay. I like you, it can also be called as love. Ah! -Why do you stay so dull for everything? -Yeah! There is much more read further. But we can not meet eachother. Not only for now but forever. I have a reason for this. You told that no one in your village are crazier than Chanti and Pandu. Ah? But in our village there is one guy much worse than them and he is my brother. So I didn't tell him his name and details. and didn't thought to say. Because a person came to my house and told he love's me, to my brother. My brother killed him because of anger. My concern is that you should not face that situation. They are not sending me out or to college as of before. You don't forget me, but you don't meet. I will also not forget you, but I will also not meet you. Why do you feel so much for this dude? -It would be good to go and kidnap her? -Hey! -She told me not to meet right. -Who is he? Hey, Sekhar... if a girl says no that means she needs it. Even Power Star told this singing song dude. -Khushi... -Yes. In these situations girls say no every time, I don't like. Because in future if anything happened, I told you that day, you only didn't listen to me, -blaming you and show paddle. -Correct. -Hmm... -Hey. Will you change anything as you like? -Hey! -Yes. Look how we will change your love story too. Come on, Pandu. [chuckles] All the best dude. For us dude. Did you listen today's class? [indistinctive chatter] No one will understand what she teches. Do you think no one will understand if you don't? [indistinctive chatter] You will say like that only. We will go behind the school, come on. Stop nuisance about films, -Then what we should talk about? -Practicals are coming near. Hey, they are coming. [indistinctive chatter] -Eat properly. -Bring the books which you want to write. [music mutes voice] -Hey! -Hey! -Shh... -If anyone opens there mouth I will kill. -No one can speak now. -I will kill you if you shout. -Come on, move. -Hey, get up. Get up! -Come on, move. Move. -You get up first. I will slay you. -Oh no! -Hey, get up. Shh... I will slay you if anyone shouts. Hey, who you people are and what is all this? Hey, we are Sekhar friend. Myself Chanti and he is Pandu. -Are you from Bellampally? -Yes. [screams] Shh... Hey, shut your mouth don't shout. [screams] -Shut up. -Shh... -Shout your mouth. -Shut your mouth, Buffalo. -Tell me where is Gowri. -Tell me where is Gowri. Oh god! I will not say. I gave my word to Gowri. Hey, it will be good if you say. -If we don't say? -It's good for us. What's that? Everyone bashes if they want to know something, But we will keep kisses. Where is Gowri. -Tell me. Tell... -Leave me. Hey, you stop man. If you keep on kissing her continuously she might let you kiss her for life long. Hey, tell me where is Gowri. Else I will come and kiss you all. Hey, I beg you. Tell me. Tell me. -She is going to tuition daily. -Okay. Two bodyguards will also, be along with her. -Okay! -Tution? By the way, what is the name of that tuition master? -Padmam. -Padmam. Padmam? Hey, Sekhar. -Hey, Sekhar... come here once. -Shucks! -What guys? -Come on, dude. -Come on, dude. -You come and sit first. -Shucks! -Hey! [sighs] -Shucks! -Come on. Look man she is down there. Gowri. Gowri... Hey, why did you brought her? You told to bring and we brought her. Gowri. -Do you have any sense at all? -Sprinkle some water. Gowri. Gowri. Why I am here? Gowri, nothing happened... Are these guys your friends? Didn't I tell you not to meet right? -Then why did you brought me forcefully? -Shucks! No, Gowri... listen to me once. Hey, what not? Don't you understand I'm saying it for our sake? Please listen to me for once. When you left after giving that letter... [door creaks] -Gowri, these guys... -Hey! We can talk those later. -Hey. Hey! -First, give her this coconut. -Give it. -Hey, why coconuts at this time? Get lost. Drink it... -Gowri... -No need. -Please Gowri... -No need. -Take it Gowri... -I told you I don't need right? Hey, why did you gave Coconuts now? I mixed Chanti and Pandu's medicine in those coconuts. What? Is it? Then what would happen now? That... -Is it? -Yes... Idiot, you ask like you don't know anything. "What is happening within me?" "What is this change inside me?" "What is happening within me?" "What is it searching in you?" "The age is simmering rising amorous inside me" "My desire is pursuing me asking for intimacy" "Is it true?" "Is it true?" "You've have allured my heart with your enchanting beauty" "You are tempting me and my desires are coming out" "Pamper me, share your feelings and make your presence count" "Give me pain. Convince me if I object. Come to me like a storm and allure me" "Shall I unite with you?" "Shall I become cupid?" "What is happening within me?" "What is this change inside me?" "What is happening within me?" "What is it searching in you?" "What is happening?" "What actually happening?" "Your tender waist gives me a feeling of swinging in heaven" "You are burning me with your blazing beauty" "After your eyes saw me, my body craved for you. So, satiate me" "You should stop my bodily hiccups of my amorous craving" "Shall I become your other half?" "Shall I become your pleasure?" It's like my body feels heavy. [stretching] Hmm... It's like I lost weight from my body. What? Er... Nothing. Nothing. Hey, why are we like this? -Damn! -Shucks! You do like this to full fill your desire? Gowri, it's not me it's them who did this. Did they do? [sighs] Shucks! No... I have done everything but there the reason for this. What am I talking? I understood. This is all a drama which you people played. You are innocent in this, they are villains, but I am the one who lost. What happened? They might have told you that if you commit for once girls would stay -No. -and you believed that. But I committed my heart to you a long time ago. You don't know that. Gowri, I am also feeling very sad for what has happened. [slap] Damn! Are you feeling sad? Do you know how bad I am feeling? Damn! [door creaks] What dude she slapped and left like that? I think she hasn't satisfied with flirting. [laughs] -Hey! Oh my god! -Oh my god! Hey! -What happened man? -What man? I am feeling sad about the mistake I have committed, you talk about flirting without any shame. Damn! When all the villagers call you idiot... You made me fool because I was with you. -It's not like that Sekhar. -Shut your mouth. When you are making trouble to all the villagers, for standing beside you, you people kept me in sorrows. God is watching everything, he will send anyone to teach you people, a lesson. Get lost! Why did he shout at us and left? I think flirting wasn't enough for him too. [laughing] Come on. [indistinctive chatter] [bicycle bell rings] India won the match last night. Dhoni smashed two sixers in last two balls. Hey, will you eat? Damn! Get lost. [laughs] Look Ganga Bhavani, I think my opinion on you would change. -Tomorrow, wear saree and come. -Damn! Useless idiots. [laughs] [bicycle bell rings] Come on Chanti. Get up man. Get up. -Idiots have come. -Come on, move. Move! Hey, Veerababu, give two teas. To make tea, milk, sugar, decoction, one glass and to wash it surf is required, a stove and to burn it we need gas and to prepare it a person is needed. Do you know, it has this all things? What Chanti, -this is the process to prepare tea? -Don't know, did I prepared anytime? Hey, do you thought Tea is a word? There is a union behind it.

"She took our life with her stare" "My heart and thoughts are filled with alluring joy" "She has pierced an arrow in my heart" "Your charm pierced us" "and brought us to you" "Your curves set my heart" "honking like a train" "You've spread your aesthetics" "My nerves felt as if they are squeezed" "She gave a kiss on the cheek" "and I feel I'm strapped here with happiness" "What magic did she do?

Let's do something. -Okay. -It is for both of us. -Well, this is good. -Okay, it is acceptable. -What's happening? What are you arguing about yours and mine? Granny, I have to tell you something. Come here. What is it? Well, we are about to get daughter-in-law to this house. -Yes. -[chuckles] Is it? Who is she? She is the none other than the newly joined teacher. -Is it? -Yes. We've even told her that we would introduce you to her today. -Come let's go. -Hey, wait... Who would she marry amongst you? Both of us. Stop it! Worthless fools! Granny... Granny, you can scold us later. Now, let's go to the teacher and talk to her. Hey, I won't come. Well, let's do something. Ask the teacher whom she likes amongst us. He will be the one who would marry her. Let's go... Let's go... What if she says she likes both of us? Stop it, dude. Both of you along with her would get bashed. Hey Venkata Thayaru, she is well-educated girl. You have to talk to her with respect. -Alright. -We have arranged her stay... ...in Subbu's house as it is a nice house, Granny. -Yeah... -Yeah... Listen Granny, don't ask too many questions. Finish your conversation with her with just two questions. Hell with your drill! Where is the girl? We've arrived to her place. This is where she lives. -Let's go. -Come on, granny... Come... [door opens] Look, there she is... -She is the newly joined teacher. -There is no one over there, right? Hey Granny, she is standing over there, right? I can't see her, right? Uh! She is walking over there, right? Only the TV is playing. There is no one else.

There is no one there except air. Worthless idiots! Worthless idiots! Hell! Let go and check. Chanti and Pandu, when did you come? Why did my granny tell that she didn't see you when we brought her here? Is it? Perhaps, she might have not seen me properly. No... No... We have asked Satya Raj too. Even he said that he didn't see... anything. [electricity buzzes] [door closes] [electricity buzzes] [thud] [utensils tumble] [electricity buzzes] [growls] [utensils tumbling] [screams] [screams] Then, how can you see me? [screams] [bellows] [thud] [shatters] [clinks] [tumbling] I'm Venkata Lakshmi... [bellows] [utensils tumbling] Ah!

If not our bad luck, why the hell are you visible only to us? Because I want only you. If you are done with the rest, shall we start? [trembling] Where? [lion roaring in TV] Oh Godess Durga... -Oh Godess Durga... -Oh Godess Durga... Pandu, run fast. Let's go inside Goddess Durga temple. The ghost cannot come to us if we're inside the temple. Keep going... [panting] Keep going... Come on, run.... Oh Goddess Durga... Oh Goddess Durga... -Please save us. -We've arrived. We're safe. Oh Godess Durga... She is coming... Hey...

I won't talk to you. -Please dude. Venkata Lakshmi is beating black and blue out of us. -Ah! -[whimpering] Hmph! I won't believe you. Our bodies are pulped. Believe us at least seeing these bruises. Please believe us. She is somewhere around here. Hey... Hey... Oh Goddess Durga! -Sekhar, do something... -Hey, wait. Alright, I believe you. There is one person who can give a solution for this. [whimpers] Hey, is ghost haunting you? Yes. [bashing] I know how to get rid of that ghost very well. Please do that, I plead you. [whimpers] The ghost wouldn't go away if I don't bash you. Shucks! What are you doing? The ghost wouldn't go away if I don't bash you. Hey, he's beating the hell out of me... Ouch! Oh no! Hey, we aren't possessed. It is that the ghost is chasing us. That's it. Why aren't you telling that? -I bashed you up unnecessarily. -You didn't allow us to speak. By the way, how is the ghost? -Superb! -She is very beautiful and hot! Hey... -Oh no... No... -Hey... Stop thrashing. They've got beaten up more than they needed. Don't hit us. You tell him, Sekhar. Hmm... Every human has a desire in their life. If they die wihout their desire getting fulfilled, they become ghosts. Get to know the desire of the ghost. If its desire gets fulfilled, it goes away on its own. Aah! Where would we find the ghost now? HINDU CREAMATORIUM BELLAMPALLY Oh man! Oh no! -Hey, won't you come? -Won't you come? Who can see the ghost? We can see it. Who has to enter the crematorim? -We... -We... Understood, right? Go now. -Moreover, I'm scared of a graveyard. -Don't you think we are not scared too? -Go now -We have no choice, right? Let's go. -[barking sounds] -I won't go... Oh no! -Hey... -Chanti, please come. Go idiots HINDU CREAMATORIUM BELLAMPALLY Oh God! I'm scared. [whimpers] [owl hoots] -Would ghosts be on trees or hills? -We should have brought our granny. -I have never entered a graveyard. -She would have met our grandpa. And her presence would have given us courage, Chanti. [whimpers] [owl hoots] [screams] -Oh no... -Hey, it is a human skull... [screams] [running footsteps] [fire crackling] Welcome... Welcome... Where is she? [screams] We don't know anything. Venkata Lakshmi, what do you want? Why are you being visible only to us? I will leave you if you do a work for me. -Tell us... -What shall we do? Tell us... Would you do anything for me? Sure, Venkata Lakshmi... We would do anything for you. Please land. -What is it? Tell us, Venkata Lakshmi. -Tell us. Do you know Nagampeta Veera Reddy? A human might not fellow human. But they'll definitely know about demons. -We know him. -There is no wicked person like him. He has a house at Nagampeta. Yes. There is a room in that house. There would be a room in the house for sure. There is a cot in that room. There would be a cot in the room for sure. There is an iron trunk box beside that cot. It might be there. There is a small chest inside that iron trunk box. So? Get it to me, I will leave you. [gasps] Wh... What? -We have to go to Nagampeta, -Get inside Veera Reddy's house, -Enter into his room, -And get the chest from the trunk box? We can't come out if we go inside. Do you know what he does if he knows about this? [screams] We can't do that. -We can't do that. -We can't do that. Do you know how a ghost would kill you? [gasps] To get the chest or not, decide it yourself. [gasps] [pants] Whoa! Ve... Venkata Lakshmi... -Ve... Venkata Lakshmi... Ve... Venkata Lakshmi... -Where are you? -Venkata Lakshmi... If we go for the box... [slashes] [groans] What if we don't get the chest? [bashing up] Whoa! [whimpers] -Venkata Lakshmi, where are you? -Oh madam... -Venkata Lakshmi... -Oh madam... Hey, how much more time would you take? -What are you doing? -Sekhar... -Our good days have ended. -What happened? -Hey... -[sobs] What happened dude? Seems like Venkata Lakshmi won't let us live. [music] -[birds chirping] [cock-a-doodle-do] -Hey... Hey... Wake up. [utensil clangs] [splash] [gasps] Get up [yawns] [sighs] -Why do you want to sleep more? -Hey Sekhar... -Chanti, is this a dream? -You had the same dream? Umm... The teacher... Ghost... Veera Reddy. -Ah! -Same to same It is really like a dream for both of us to get the same dream. Get ready first. -Get up... Go now. -We are going! -You too. Go -Evil person... Huh! Brush your teeth and wash your face. -Go... -We'll do it. As if you have to tell us what to do. He woke me in the early morning... [gasps] [whimpers] [whimpers] -Pandu... come here... -What is it, Chanti? [whimpers] [sobs] What happened? [whimpers] This is not a dream, but real. Hey, what have you decided? [stammers] We need some time. Decide quickly. I have less patience. Moreover, I'm very thirsty. -I need to have tea. -Do ghosts have tea? Umm... They would drink. They add blood in it and drink. It is not right for a ghost to trouble humans. Well, why don't you can get that chest yourself as you are a ghost? Veera Reddy secured his house on all the sides with a spell. I can't cross it and go inside his house. That's why I asked you to do that. Would you get it or not? -Hmm... We need some time. -We need some time. Hey, what's with you again? Hey come here. The thing is that, as you are full of ideas, I called you so that you would suggest an idea for us. What's the problem? Come here. [mumbling] Ah! Ha... [sighs] Hey Veera Reddy is a human. You can somehow manage him. But Venkata Laksmi... Shucks! She is a ghost and moreover she knows everything about you. Hence, escaping her is difficult. True indeed, it is difficult to escape a ghost. Well, it is said that people who are killed by ghosts become ghosts. It it true? Hey, we'll talk to her instead of him. -What? What's this fuss? -You leave now. -Go now... -Go... We agree with your proposal. -To what? Proposal to die? No... No... We agree to bring that chest. -Good. Be on the work. -Okay. Chanti, I'm scared. Shut up and keep moving. Do you think I'm relaxed? [indistinct cow mooing] Oh my freaking God, is this a house? No, it is a fort. What is the difference between the fort and this house? If they build it for themselves, it is called a house. If they build it for people, it is called a fort. Oh! Give that to me, I'll feed it. -Hey Gowri... -Yeah... Lashmi, eat. Oh my goodness, she is a maid here. -Is it? -Have a look. Move... She is maid indeed. -Ah! -Ah! She saw us. Keep feeding, I'll be right back. Okay. [groans] Hey, why are you here? Did he send you again? We came here for another work. Get us some job in this house. Damn! People dump the trash outside, but don't dump it inside their house by getting it from outside. Ah! It is an insult! Hey, why did you come here? I feel enraged seeing you. Gowri, please. It is necessary for them to get a job in this house. -Try to understand. Don't deny. -Why is requesting her? What's so necessary? I won't accept. -My brother won't accept at all. -Hey, who is your brother? Who is your brother? Worker or milk supplier? Hey, stay out of this... Hey, call him. -I'll see why he won't accept. -Hey... Hey... Her brother is not a worker, but the owner. He is Veera Reddy. Veera Reddy? -Veera Reddy? -Yes What are you saying? -Are you Veera Reddy's sister? -Yes. Hey, are you aware of this earlier? -Yes, I'm aware of it. -Hey... Move... Do you know it when you loved Gowri? -Yes, I know. -Hey, don't you feel shy like that. We feel like dying. Hey Pandu, we're dead. Do you know what we did? We kidnapped Mr Veera Reddy's sister and made her sleep with him. Hey Chanti, we'll be killed here. -Yes, indeed. If I go to my brother and tell him, both of you will be killed here. -Please no... -Gowri... Gowri, wait. -Please listen to me. -Hey, you just wait. Hey Gowri, would you listen to us? What's with your audacity? Hey there is a proverb for a guy with audacity... [mutes] Do you know that? There is another proverb 'my word is your death'. Do you know that? -Umm... -Hey, Pandu. -Yes -That word should be ours, -Show her the video. -Sure? No problem, show her. [clicks on mobile] Look, Sri Kanaka Mahalaksmi Recording Dance Troop. Hey idiots! Did you record this too? Hey, what's this? Would you betray your friend? That betrayal would help us now. Look, we don't know what you'd do. You should get us some job in this house immediately. Alright, I'll do that. Give way. [chuckles] Good girl. -Ah! -Hey! Hey Sekhar, one might feel sad when they fell a tree. But it would be soothing when you set a campfire with its firewood. -Well said! -Even this is the same. Not at all good! -No problem. -No problem. Come dude. Greetings, sir. [chuckles] Greetings What's up auditor? How are our accounts work going on? They are going very well, sir. We've been seeing that there is not even one rupee difference in the account.

Take it. -Are you are telling me, sir? -Yes -Is it for me, sir? -Take it. Take it... Sir, do you want me to take this bag? Sir, thank you very much. -[chuckles] -Thank you, sir. Come here... Come here... -Coming, sir... -Come... Come... Sure, sir. Sir... Ouch! You shouldn't take my money without my knowledge. Also, you shouldn't take it with my knowledge. When I gave you the money, I thought that you'd say 'I don't want your money'. But you didn't say that, which means you have some desire for my money. [gasps] Sir, I'll never take your money again. If you even touch my feet and ask me to do that, I won't take at all, sir. Fix! Fix it. [chuckles] -You are a good person. -Sir... Thank you, sir. Should I have to touch your feet? Touch your feet? What? Ow! Sister... My sister is coming. Keep smiley face. -I will leave, sir. -Sure... Sure. Thank you, sir. His sister arrived and saved me. Go... Go, dude.

When I didn't stop having those despite telling me several times, It means that I can't stop having them. Hey, zip it. Take these two guys and join them in some work. You come, dear. Idiot! Why are you staring us like that? Both of you seem like good persons. Ah! Why are you staring me like that? You seem like a clever person, sir. Did your work get done? Did our plans miss out anytime, eh? Thanks Gowri. Hmph! Leave my hands. You've blackmailed me and made me to get work for your friends. And now you are thanking me for that? I came here to tell that there won't be anything between us after this. If something goes wrong, my brother will kill you. That is guaranteed. Oh! I'm warning you priorly, I don't have anything to do with this. Bye. -Eh! -Gowri... Ow! Why is she threatening us? Who cares? At last, you've joined in the work. What's next -What would it be? -What would it be? -Start the work. -Start the work. So be on it. -Hey... Sekhar. -Hey... Sekhar. Who do we care? Let's go. -When will we find that iron trunk box? -When will we find that iron trunk box? Let's find out. [whistles] [whistles] -What? -Name? -Chilaka -Chilaka? What do you do? I'm a maid. -Eh? -What works do you do? [music over voice] I do all kinds of work. Wow! She is an all-rounder. Hey Chanti, We should do her work too. -I'll squeeze her like squeezing dough. -Hey, Pandu. Why is your stare more effective than mine? -Chilaka likes fruit, right? -True [tractor whirring] -Sir... -Sir... Give me a moment. Why did two persons bring a single coffee? -The thing is that, he lighted the stove. -He kept the vessel on the stove. -He poured milk in it. -He added coffee powder to it. -He boiled the coffee. -He filtered it. -He poured the coffee in a cup. -He placed cup in the saucer. -Whatever we do, we do it together. -We bring it together. -We take it together. -We take it together. What? We mean, we'll take the cup after you drink coffee. Forget it! Who are they? They are bizarre. -They are beggars, brother. -[splatters] I brought them when I saw them begging in the roads. Shucks. Take this. I've washed my hands and I prepared coffee, sir. -Shut it! -Sir, coffee. Hello. Yeah, I'm coming. [mumbling] Hey... Look there. Our jackpot. [laughs] -Hey... -[laughs] -Hey, what happened? -[laughs] Hey... Stop laughing idiots. Why are you laughing? Do you know how good Venkata Lakshmi had done us? If Venkata Lakshmi wouldn't have told us about the chest, how would we know about Veera Reddy's iron trunk box? What do you mean? Won't you bring that iron trunk box as Venkata Lakshmi said? We'll say that we would get it. But we'll run away with the money inside that iron trunk box. I'm not getting you. -Along with Venkata Lakshmi iron trunk box -Chanti and Pandu would run away. How dare you cheat a ghost? -What if she knows about it? -How would she know? As she can be neither seen or heard, therefore, you can't tell her. She doesn't know unless we tell her. -Oh yeah! -Damn! You told now, right? What happened? I know that you are such despicable people, -We've done a mistake, Venkata Lakshmi. -I came to stay behind you. Whoa! Henceforth, I won't leave you till your death. I feel both of you are doing over action. How can we believe that it is a ghost? Huh? I don't feel that there is a ghost. -Hey idiot! -Hey... Sekhar... Venkata Lakshmi... -[screams] -No, Venkata Lakshmi... Please leave us, Venkata Lakshmi... Hey, I heard some girl call my name. Is it? From now, he will also hear my voice. Hmph! What Sekhar? Ms Venkata Lakshmi, yes ma'am. -Now, he will understand. -No... No... It's just the beginning. [chuckles] -Did you find any way? -Way? -We found a wide highway. -Yes What does it mean? I don't know if you lost your brain before or after death... Um... Um... -The thing is that, you're becoming very serious for this simple matter. Is it that easy? Easy means... What we understood after seeing all these is that, the people in Veera Reddy's house have the habit of guzzling cow milk before sleep. If we mix sleeping tablets in that milk, they'll be sleeping all night, and we'll run away with that trunk box. Go and get those tablets immediately. -I'll call you. -Okay. -Super. -Tell them, Chanti-Pandu sent you. -Then, I'll definitely get them. -Do something Bye. -Venkata Lakshmi... -Venkata Lakshmi... -Consider your work is done. -Consider your work is done. -Yeah... -Yeah... -Let's go. -Believe me. Come... Greetings, sir. I need 2 lakh rupees for my daughter's wedding. If you could arrange... You know my process, right? Yes, I know it sir. That's why I brought my land papers. Are two lakhs enough or do you need three lakhs? No need, sir. Two lakhs are enough. Hey... Come here. Give your thumb impression here. Here. See you, sir. [spits] Hey, I told you several times to stop having those. Go away. Sir, who the hell is he spitting in that mug all the time? I don't know about you but I hate such things. I'm staying silent because of you. Look, hell with him and his dirty poses! He has extra fat in his body and has no smile on his face, sir. If you don't like him, fire him right away sir. In one of the past attacks, He got stabbed twice which was actually meant for me. That's why I don't bother about these simple things. Tell me, if you want to get stabbed for me. Um... Not needed, sir. Why would I put my life at stake for a Paan? Here, take this sir. Hand these papers to our bank manager and get 20 lakh rupees loan. What are you thinking? Didn't you understand? Understood, sir. You gave him 2 lakh rupees by making him pawn his land papers. And you want to get 20 lakh rupees by pawning the same papers in the bank. No person who drinks the water of River Godavari gets this kind of idea, sir. I don't understand one thing here. Why can't they directly pawn these papers and get a loan? Because the manager of the bank would check these papers and tell them these are invalid. What if we go to the bank? They would say that it would be valid twice, fool. Oh my God! I never learned this much when I was studying chartered accountancy. You are a legend! Why did the shopkeeper give powder when we asked for pills? Whatever! Mix it quickly. Someone will come. I'll stir it. Someone will come. Stir it quickly. -Wait, I'm getting milk. -Let's go. They are coming. Let's go. [stirring] -Have milk. -We don't want milk. Go away. Go away. We don't want milk. We're having it every day. We don't want milk. Go away. I don't want... Go... -You have it at least. -I'm bored drinking it every day. Go. What is the hell is wrong with them? Should they get bored today? What happened to all of you? Actually, we are bored of drinking of drinking milk, Chilaka. -Yes. -We won't drink milk. What's the mess? We're asking her to give us milk, bro. Drink quickly and go to sleep. Alright bro. Hand us the milk glass. Hey, go away. We don't want milk. Hey, why did everything turn upside down? We have to do something. Let's go.

[door creaks open] What's this? Tremors started in silence -Who knows what might have happened? -Chanti, it became a mess. What are you doing here? The shopkeeper gave love philtre instead of sleeping pills. -He gave a love philtre? -Do something and come out. That means, they would become active instead of going to sleep? -Oh! You are here! Come... Come... -We're in trouble. We'll be dead, Chanti. [people chasing] Hey stop... -We won't leave you today. -Oh no! [panting] Whoa! Hey... Hey... I'm Ramesh. -Who cares who you are at this time? -Oh my God! Hey, sexual predator! Hey, let's hide in Gowri's room. Gowri... Gowri... [knocks] Open the door. -Please open the door. -Shucks! Go to hell! Oh! They are here. Oh no! [overlap of voices] Wait... -[panting] -Water... Huh! [panting] Hey, found you! [screams] You guys are squeezing me like squeezing dough. Leave me. I'm a man. Dirty idiots. Go away! Hey... Hey... Stop! Hey... Hey... Stop! [shuts door] [temple procession percussions] [car honks] [temple procession percussions] -Yes -Greetings, sir. -You go on, I'll be right back. -Okay brother. -Tell me. -Sir, the MLA came to our village. Why is the temple thronging? Yes. Moreover, today there neither any festival nor celebration. Welcome. Welcome... What is today's speciality, priest? It is the work of a guy. He said that today is his fiance's birthday. He cleaned the entire temple at 12 am today, decorated it, monitored the food being cooked and feeding the poor. [music] [temple bell ringing] [chanting] -Gowri -Yes Take this offering. Happy birthday. [birds chirping] -Hey Venkatalakshmi, come. -Hey! Why do you want her? -Why do you ask? -The thing is that, She felt bad as our plan didn't work yesterday. -Yes -I don't feel bad. Ah! [chuckles] Venkata Lakshmi... Come... Come... But I'd feel bad if you don't come up with another idea. Do you think ideas are fruits that they are always available? I dare you suggest an idea. Come on, do it. Idea? Idea... Idea... Hey Chanti, Venkata Lakshmi is very beautiful, right? Look at the curve of her waist, it is very alluring. Damn you! She is a ghost. You can be perverted, but not towards a ghost. Idea! -What is it, Venkata Lakshmi? -Say it... Come on, say it. -If we create a diversion... -Say it in Telugu... -Okay... Okay... -I understood it. I'll tell. -Say it... Come on, say it. -We have to create a diversion, If we make people attend to one side, we can finish our work. Everything is alright. But what is meant by direction It is not direction but diversion. It means diverting their attention. -It is diverting their attention! -Right... Right... We understood it, but how do we do that diversion? Hey look there. Idea! -What is it? -We'll rape Chilaka. -Hey! -Not for real... We'll act. -We'll act. -The thing is that, When we try to enact an act of raping Chilaka, Veera Reddy's henchmen would get diverted to that and meanwhile, we'll do our job. Hey, don't fight to decide who would be going to do that act. It is Pandu who would go to Chilaka. -[chuckles] -Why so? Hey, you can open any almirah or vaults without keys. You get the trunk box. Correct. That is correct. Whatever you do or however you do, get the trunk box before 28th of this month. What would happen after that date? After that, my soul would remain on earth. [gasps] Does it mean that you won't be here? -Would you leave? -Would you leave? Hmm... I'll leave. But I'll kill both of you and take you along with me. 28th right? We'll get it. We'll definitely get it. Sir, I was told that you called me. There are 5 lakh rupees in this suitcase. Take it. Look, there it is. Sir, whatever you do, whatever you say, I don't want your money. I swear, I won't touch that suitcase even if you kill me. Oh! Why are you hasty? If you don't want, leave it. As our guys told me you need 5 lakh rupees to pay income tax, so I asked you. Alright, forget it. You pay the tax from your pocket. Got it, sir. Income is yours but the tax is mine. [laughs] -Hey Pandu, handle Chilaka. -Okay. After everyone comes here, I'll bring the chest. Okay. Be careful. [humming] [knocking] I'm coming. [opens door] Why are you here? What do you want? What do I want? I want to rape you. What do you mean? Why did you turn back when I said rape? As you are very tender, I was cautious if you could withstand me. Ah! Though I might look tender, [music over voice] Wow, booze! I'll get started with you after I have this. Haha! There would be screams. Shall I open it? -What would you open? -The lid. If I would have already known that you would very cooperative for this act, I would have planned for this long ago, Chilaka. Wow! Ah! Did she drink all the booze? Never mind. Why are you staring like a hawk, Chilaka? -Aha! -That's why. Anyhow, what we need now is rage with extreme moaning Chilaka. It would be very nice if we cut the moaning. Oh God! She scratched me. -[screams] -Don't you scream! Don't you scream! [whimpers] Come... Come... -[screams] -Didn't you say you want it? Hey why are the screams coming in a different tone? What might he be thinking a rape means? -Uh? -I don't understand. Do something. Go and watch from the window. Go dude. We should know what's happening inside, right? Okay. -Didn't you say you want it? -[screams] -Oh! She scratched me. -Why is he screaming instead of Chilaka? Whatever. All I need is work getting done. [window door creaks open] -Chilaka, please me. -Is it good? -Please leave me. -I can't take this. -Tell me if you liked it? -Hey Sekhar, save me. -What's happening? -Sekhar, save me. -Come... -What's this? What's happening? -Hey Pandu... -Come... You can't get out of my room if you enter once. [whimpering] Hey, come to the door. -[door creaks open] Come -Oh God! Sekhar... Pull me out. Oh man! He wants to rape! Idiot! Hmph! [slams door] [door opens] -What happened? -It was some noise from the radio, sir. -Alright. Go to sleep. -Okay. Switch off that radio. Oh man! My body is severely aching, Chanti. Hey, stop your whining! You whine more terribly than ghosts. You can't understand my pain. Oh man! -Hey Pandu! -Yes It is a terrible thing that happened to you. Alright, tell me which part of your body is paining. What's that? This was given by Ayurvedic priest. Apply this and pain will vanish. -Is it? -Tell me, where you feel the pain? Give it to me. Just tell me. Give it to me. -[screams] -Hey, why are you applying there? It is more paining over there. Hey, what's with you guys? Gowri, the thing is that... -What was the purpose you came to my home? Gowri, listen to me. Look, I know you are an idiot. When I'm getting over it, you proved again that you are an idiot. Thank you very much. Hey, I'm warning all of you, That's my brother's house which is mine. If you do anything wrong, I'll see that your heads and knees are pulped. Oh Gowri, please try to listen to me. Leave my hand. -The thing is that... -Hmph! [chuckles] What's it? What are you staring at? -Did you understand what I said? -Yes, I understood it now. I too understood it just now, Chanti. What's it? -It is her house, right? -Which means the trunk box is also hers. -Which means she will get it for us. -Yeah, she can get it for us. -Trunk box? -Yes. The thing is that... The thing about is trunk box is... Lend your ear I'll tell you. There is a chest in that trunk box, get it for us. -Is that why you came to my house? -Yes. I don't accept it at all. You will definitely accept. You have no choice. Why do you get her involved in this? -Gowri, don't do it. -Shut up! You are telling me as if I have agreed with them. Won't you do it? -What's with you? -[chuckles] -Look at this -Shucks! -Now tell me, won't you do it? -Hmph! -What's this? -[chuckles] She said she won't do our work -[weeps] -Gowri, I'm sorry. Listen to me... Hey Chanti, what is the meaning of her weeping? It means she will bring it perfectly for sure. -Ah! Are you sure? -Yes. -Oh! Ah! -Hmph! -Go... -Gowri... Gowri... Gowri... -She will get it... -You idiot! Bloody idiots! Damn you! I understood just now that there would be good in bad things you do. Hey Pandu, Venkata Lakshmi is supporting us. Yes. We'll have no looking back. [chuckles] If you blabber, I will change the shape of your body parts. It is the best thing. Kill both of them. Hey, we'll handle about the chest. You come with me Pandu. See you. Hey! [anklets jingling] Oh no! Oh God! She is a rapist. Hmm... Stay here. [snoring] [keys clunking] [creaking] [thud] [stretches] Gowri... Congratulations, sir! -What? -Your sister is going to become a mother. Bro, she said your sister is going to become a mother. Which means you are going to become an uncle. It means it is festival for the entire village. Hey, come on celebrate! [cheering] Bro, give a handshake. Bro... Have sweet... Have it! Why is everyone celebrating with joy, what happened, sir? Madam Gowri is going to become a mother. Is it? Sir, congratulations! When is the wedding, sir? Eh! Aw! [bellows] [gun fires] Why the hell are you trembling? -Some mistake had happened. -What do you mean? No... Don't think otherwise. When I took Gowri to tution class recently I felt someone had hit me on my head. When I opened my eyes, it was tuition teacher who said that I was hit. -Bring that teacher here. -Okay, bro. -Hey, let's go. -Hey, let's go... Come... Bro, he is the tuition teacher. Ouch! Did you slap me, sir? Ouch! You are slapping me, sir. -Hey -Sir. Who the hell are they? I'm not lying, I didn't see their faces sir. But I remember that they called them Chandu and Pandu when they going out of the gate. Where do they stay? I heard them talking about Bellampally, sir. Hey, are we having any person from Bellampally village? Oh my God! What might have happened? Did she get pregnant? How? How will we get the keys? We have unnecessarily told her that we came for that chest. It would have been better if we would have done it ourselves. See now, what she had done? Hey, look. -Did you hear? -What is it? -Veera Reddy is calling both of you. -Ah! You heard nothing, right? I hear nothing except Veera Reddy's orders. Mr Bulli Reddy, Veera Reddy will be prosperous if clever people like you be with him. Let's go. Freaking expressionless-faced who takes selfies with scarecrows! -Bro... -Bro... -Ramesh, Suresh -Yes -Chanti, Pandu... -Aw! Do you know them? -Don't know, bro -Don't know, bro Hey, what's your village? -Bellampally, bro -Bellampally, bro Heard that Chanti and Pandu live in that village. Yeah, Chanti and Pandu live in Bellampally. Take our guys and bring them here. What's with bringing Chanti and Pandu? Go now. Okay, bro. Let's go. Hmph! Bro, as we arrived Bellampally, If we find Chanti and Pandu, shall we kill them here or take them to our place? Hey, let's not do it here. Veera Reddy bro will suggest us about the killing if we take them there. Hey, keep moving. Move... -Not this way, we shall go that side. -Tell properly. These guys are torturing us. Bro, my legs are aching as we've been walking. -We are almost there. -How much more would you make us walk? You've have made us walk around the village twice. We'll find them if we walk like this. Hey, we won't find them if we walk. We should enquire people. Then, stay here. We'll go and enquire. -Go... -Go... [sighs] -Hi elderly person, -Hi elderly person, the thing is that Have you seen Chanti and Pandu? Come closer. Ouch! I've been minding me smoking and you are throwing sarcasm? Go in the way where you came from. Why did he slap you like that? I don't know, bro. Maybe everyone in this village hate Chanti and Pandu. -Bro, let's go back to Nagampeta -Yes, let's go. Wait. We are going to Nagampeta only with Chanti and Pandu. Let's ask someone else. Move. Move. Let's go. Are you tired, bro? We are almost done. A little more distance would do that. Look. Got it. Bro, do you want us to ask that tender coconut sell? Yes, go. -Let's go. -Ask. [groans] [chuckles] -There are a total of 50 coconuts. -Suryanarayana. -Yes, tell me. -Have you seen Chanti and Pandu? Chanti and Pandu? Aha? Here are Chanti and Pandu. Everyone is slapping us for asking about them. Let's go to Nagampeta, come on. Stop your fuss about going to Nagampeta! Finally, ask him. Awe! Have you been maintaining your diet just like I said? Wait! We'll ask him. Come on, guys. Brother, do you know where Chanti and Pandu can be? Ouch! Why do you ask me when you have them at you back? I became cheap for every idiot! Let's go. -They are running away from the back side. -Yes. Come, bro... Come... They are running away. -Wait... -Look, they are going into that lane. [overlap of voices] Stop! Stop! Why are you running? What happened? -Chanti and Pandu came running this way. -Chanti and Pandu? They just boarded the bus and went to Bombay. Bombay? Bombay? -[bellows] -[trembling] What are you talking? They went to Bombay? Yes, bro. They shouldn't escape. Hey! -Yes, bro -Go to Bombay immediately. Wherever you find them in Bombay, catch and bring them to me. Why are you staring like that? -Bro, I don't have a passport. -Me too. I too don't have passport. What is a passport, bro? [growls] Sir, it is very difficult to instantly arrange passport for all these people. The thing is that, I said so because it'll be a huge expenditure to send these people -Idiot! -Ouch! Sir, your sister opened her eyes. [weeps] Gowri, how are you, dear? Brother, I thought you would ask about that guy. I know that my Gowri... ...wouldn't do a mistake no matter what. No problem. I'll take care. [weeps] I was terrified that she would tell her brother about you. True indeed. We were terrified that she would vent her anger on you towards us. Hey Pandu, When she is going to become a mother, it means he is about to become a father. -Of course, it is. -Congratulations, Sekhar. Anyhow, why are you haste? Hmm... Why are you picking a stick? Ouch! I'm dead! Instead of feeling remorse for what you've done, you tell me I'm haste! How can you say me I'm haste? It's all because of you. -Don't hit me. Don't hit me. -On top of that, you are cracking jokes. -Look, Gowri came. -Look, there she is. -Gowri... -Disgusting! [laughs] -Gowri... Gowri, wait. -Hey Sekhar. His beloved called him. What do you want to do after this? What do we do? We want to become ghosts by killing ourselves and torture you. We too have feelings. We are humans too. We have a few things like relax, relief, gap, break etc. Please leave us. To all the people of Nagampeta, -The dance troop of Agampeta... -Pandu, listen to the announcement. -...welcomes all of you. -See you. [people cheering] -Wait... Wait...

But seeing you in this way, I feel the rage from inside to finish your task. But what can we do? We have tried all the methods.

We'll become fools in front of everyone. No one can hear her talk. -And she can't be seen too. -Yes. -Not just you, but everyone can see her. =You can see her? -Yes -Then, tell what she is wearing? -She is wearing a saree. -Cotton saree. We're not asking if it is cotton saree or silk saree. Tell its colour. She is wearing a black dotted white saree. Hey fools, Venkata Lakshmi is not a ghost. -Then? -She is a human. -Human? -Awe! It is a show that we all put together. -A show? -Yes. -Hey, did you too fool us? -Yes. -You too? -Yes. -Granny! -What did I do? -What if we are dead? -What if we are dead? It would've been good if you have died. Anyway the mission got accomplished, right? -Hey Satti! -Wait! My brother, Ranganath, [thunders rumbling] was an auditor of Veera Reddy. A Zamindar wrote off all the lands to this Bellampally village. By changing those land papers, Veera Reddy planned to grab these lands. I took up a job that Veera Reddy offered as he had helped our family all these days I tolerated his atrocities as I was working under him. But an entire village is getting destroyed because of him. I can't bear it anymore. I can't keep quiet. If I take the documents that are in this chest to Bellampally village, we would be saving those villagers. Why do you want to bring this on us? All these days, I've thought like that. But this time, I won't stay silent. Where is my sister? -She is upstairs. -Both of you, get started. Why do we want to mess with Veera Reddy? Moreover, he is a savage! True, brother. I'm scared. No problem, dear. I'm here. Don't be scared. -[collision] -[groans] [groans] [shatters] I have escaped in that accident. But my brother and sister-in-law got murdered. [stab] In order to do justice to their death, rather than seeking revenge on Veera Reddy, [explosion] it is important to do justice to this village. We have to take those documents at any cost to court on 28th for the last hearing If one has to get that chest from Veera Reddy's house, we know that only you guys can accomplish that. That's why everyone of us came together and planned it. Planned it? [electicity buzzes] [utensils tumbling] [door slams] [utensils tumbling] The entire village had cheated us together! -Who trapped us in doing us? Tell us! -Come on, tell us. Your Sekhar. Sekhar? -Hey Sekhar... -What if something went wrong with us? Stop! The entire village used to suffer due to your mischievous works. But now, your work had benefitted our village. Hey, there would be good in every human. If you make use of it to benefit others, it will do good for everyone. We need not explain you about the pain of a grieving person. Similarly, we need not specially tell you how would it be if a person reforms. Hey, these people who used to chase you to hit you, have driven away those goons to save you. Think about it. When everyone in this village was scolding you, your granny used to grieve why your grandfather had brought you. But now, you have saved the village like Rama and Lakshmana. You should prosper. [people praising] -Hey, we understood. -We understood. -We have reformed. -We have reformed. -Good. -Mr President. What's is it? Veera Reddy is coming with his goon gang. Let him come. It doesn't matter how many goons he brings along with him. We'll do everything and face anything to save this village. Let him come. Swords, sticks, crowbars... Take whatever you find and bring them along. Don't spare anyone in Bellampally village. Come on guys... Come... Come, all of you... [overlap of voices] [tyres screech] Hey, come on guys! [sickle clangs] What? Are you all surprised? My sister Gowri is reason for this. [tyres screech] [overlap of voices] -Come on, get down. -Get down... Move aside, dear. Did you start to punish them for the mistake you've committed, brother? You are not understanding the situation. They've betrayed us. They have to see my strength, force, pride and rage. They should know it. You are powerful because of the force behind you, brother. But when they came to our house and fooled everyone of you, It was proved that your force is worthless. You can kill people due to your anger but you can't bring them back alive, brother. You lost your honour to the cleverness of those who fooled you. What's is the use of this pride? Those things which you feel proud of, consider that you lost them. But there is one thing that is left in you. That is humanity. You are going now not to kill the people of that village, but the humanity that is left in you. I won't let that happen. [bellows] Oh dear, I won't listen no matter how much you explain to me. I have to see their blood today. -Do you want to see blood? -Yes. Don't you come closer. Oh dear... What's this dear? Have you gone mad? See brother, Do you get it now how painful it would be to see the blood of closed ones? I never looked upon you as my brother. I always saw you as a father. -Gowri, what's this? -You are also a good-hearted person. Only I know how beautiful it would be when you shower love. Share your love to everyone, brother. Then, every girl would become like Gowri. There would be our parents in every house. What's with you, dear? Whatever I do, it's for you, right? Then, will you do something for me? Return their lands to them. Sir, there might be miscalculations in the accounts we do, but we should it won't happen when it comes to Madam Gowri. Yes, bro. We've been considering you as God for paying us a salary. When that's the case, what if you give them livelihood? Yes, bro. Madam Gowri was raised in the hands of all of us. That's why she knows the value of human lives, brother. But we weren't raised in that way. From now on, we shall be raised in the hands of Madam Gowri. All these days, I committed many mistakes. But my sister made me to reform. Gowri... [people cheering] We're very happy for you, sir. I'll confess my crime to the police Hmph! [knife clangs] and I will surrender to them.
