"Who am I to you?" "Who am I to you?" "My eyes are restless!" "This is the effect of love!" "Don't be mum. At least tell me.. ...who am I to you?" "Who am I to you?" "I had to restrain myself, my love." "Ultimately, I had to say it." "In my dreams.. Why do you come?" "Who am I to you?" "Who am I to you?" "My eyes are restless!" "It's the effect of love." "I'm sort of lost.. Please don't ask me.. ...who am I to you?" "Who am I to you?" "How should I tell you the feelings in my heart?" "Try to read my face sometimes." "This colour of blushing is saying!" "Who am I to you?" "Who am I to you?" "Who am I to you?" Welcome to Prem Niwas! Hello! Hello! Lallu Prasad wishes all of you a good day. The match is about to begin and I will provide running commentary. The sky is absolutely clear... there are a few clouds. The umpire is inspecting the pitch. The bats man is ready. Fielders be alert. Here comes the bowler who bowls faster than the wind. I'll hit a sixer on the very first ball! Four! Sixer! Hail Lallu Prasad! How's that? Hey Lallu! You always get out at the first ball! I know but that's only to give the bowler a chance... What? - It's your batting. No, I will play. - You? Last time you batted, you broke a leg. Applause. Oh! Shut up. This time Prem will teach me. - I? You're going to the boundary to field. - You always send me to field. Fielding for him for years. - What? You'll field and he'll bat. - Oh shut up! - And you'll bowl. Yes Sir! Kapil help me. Beware. Here comes Lallu's googly! Catch the ball! I'm dead! Don't say that. - Broke my back! I'm sorry. - You fool. What are you doing here? - She came to learn cricket. Cricket? Cricket? What a game this is! A pain in the neck! Kids will play. - Shut up! Bless me aunt. How often have I told you not to address me as aunt? What a pain! In this house, pets, servants, everyone is pampered! What are you staring at me? Come with me. I am dead! - Why is she in a hurry? She has come to talk to your uncle. Brought a proposal for your brother. Rajesh is praiseworthy no doubt. The world agrees. It's no easy task maintaining this business. What do you say? - Absolutely. Now think of his marriage. Tell us if you find a girl. - I've already done that. Is that so? You have met my elder brother? Rita's father? Yes. I'm referring to Rita's elder sister, Sweety. She stayed with them while Rita always stayed with me. She's a very pretty, docile and intelligent girl. Yes, she failed in B.A. She's very modern... and has broken off a couple of engagements. Right? So what? Look at their house and lifestyle. They have a business of lakhs. The marriage will be held in style! She'll bring a lot of dowry. You'll never understand such matters! After all you're just a professor! I'll inform my brother if you agree. It's time for our kitty party. Let's go, fast! We are going. - Thanks. What? - Nothing. Good day. Come on! Always hogging! She is blinded by wealth. We'll bring a sweet, simple girl not her brother's rich daughter. Who will adorn this house with her love and affection. This house that you have nurtured with such love. The kids were so little when your sister and her husband passed away. You left your college studies incomplete to bring them up. Started with a small job. Your aim in life was to struggle for them. You didn't marry too! You've brought the boys up well. That is why Rajesh is respected. This year Prem topped M.B.A. Brother, I have seen a girl for Rajesh. A couple of days ago I had gone to Pune for a conference. I met Professor Choudhary there. Siddharth Choudhary? - Do you know him? We were in college together. We were also good friends. I met his elder daughter there. Saw her once and she won my heart. I liked her so much that I brought her picture along. She has just cleared B.A. Her name is Pooja. Very decent girl. They'll make a good pair. - I agree. Right now the family has gone to Ramtekri on a pilgrimage. We'll go there soon as they return. Just four hours drive from here. Let the boy and girl meet once. - That's the only problem. Whenever we discuss marriage he puts it off. How do we get them to meet? - I got an idea. Let's go to Ramtekri. We'll see the girl as well as go on a pilgrimage! Excellent idea! - But brother mustn't hear of this. It is a top secret. He is here. - Go on uncle! You've back? Quite late? What did the foreign collaborators say? Everything was discussed in detail. Now they will peruse our reports. If everything goes as per plans, as you said it'll be one of its kind. Hear? To launch you in business, he's putting up such a huge factory. Dinner! Wow! Sweet, savoury, pudding, fried pancakes! Anything special? Actually... - We are very happy today. Happy? We've decided to go to Ramtekri during the holidays. But uncle you wanted to go to a hill station? This place is very holy. My brother and his wife go there regularly every year. So the program is fixed. Take your new silk shirt along. Whatever for? - Anything could happen. You never know. What did he say? - I didn't hear. I never overhear. Let's replenish the dishes, Chameli. Funny! Nobody's saying anything. Can't tell you what we're going to find in Ramtekri. "Without faith there can not be devotion." "It is like Ram without compassion." "Without Ram's mercies there are no dreams.." ...and the soul becomes restless. "You auspicious, eliminator of sorrows." Son of Dasharath, you're Lord Krishna. Son of Dasharath, you're Lord Krishna. Hurry up Papa. If Mummy sees you experimenting here, she'll be mad. So let her! Am I scared of her? Once she sees what I've rustled she will break her fast. What is it? - Not me, Mummy. Furiously he said, 'Janak!' Sita restless and people scared... Who broke the jar? - What? Who broke the jar? When Ramchandra broke Lord Shiva's bow... enraged Parsuram asked who had broken it. With humility and love Lord Ram answered... Oh Lord and Master of the universe. Thy humble servant did the deed. Have some shame. We have two young daughters. What'll they think? Did I say something wrong beloved? It's beyond both of us to win against you. If anyone can win against you, it's... - Nisha! Good morning uncle! Naughty brat! Always enters like a storm! Papa has sent back the library books and thanked you. Okay- Brother. Your bill. Here it is. Give me the books so that I can leave. That is fine. Nisha, will you do me a favour? Will you check this bill while I return from the stores? Give it to me. - Very good. Thanks but no mischief. Now come on! Staring away! Excuse me! Excuse me! Is this Ramnarain Lodge? Didn't read the board outside? Lost my calculation. Where was I? 75 and 9.. - 84.. What is it? - Can you tell me... which room Professor Choudhary has? Why? Because it's private. Understood. - What? Stand up. Pardon me? - Stand up! You guys don't study all year round. - What? Oh yes! Loaf around all year and then cone during exams to increase your marks! Increase the power of your spectacles! Just because you're the manager... God knows what you think of yourself! - Now look... Good Lord! Nisha! - I'm here, sister. You're sitting here! And Mummy has been waiting for you. What are you doing here? - I was... Come in. - I'll have the luggage kept. Okay, Son. Please come. You asked for Professor Choudhary. These are his daughters... Pooja and Nisha. This is Mr. Kailashnath, your Papa's friend. Good day. - Good day. He wants to meet professor. - Please come. Okay- Oh! Manager uncle. Here you are. Total all done. - Done? Well done. Here's your reward. Thank you! Manager, check the total again. They say pretty girls can never calculate. What did you say? - You eat chocolates? Don't take my name! Excellent professor! What delicious savouries! Have them with sour chutney. You'll forget the best savouries. Mr. Siddharth! Oh! Kailashnath! What a pleasant surprise! What a pleasant surprise! Siddharth! My younger nephew, Prem. - Bless you, son. Your uncle lost a bet to me. - What? He had said only I'd lose hair but look he's balding too! Look who's here. Hello. Recognise me? - How are you? How would he be? He's amongst the top industrialists in the country! Please come and sit. Really, when I read about you in the newspapers I feel very proud. It's fine. Son, you probably don't know the history about us. We were together in college and used to have a ball. Bring it and keep it here. You've met my children. Do you come here every year? No. I've come for a special purpose. - Is it? I'd like your elder daughter for my elder nephew Rajesh. Pooja? - Yes, if you don't mind... What are you saying? He is your nephew. He has come with us. Why don't you meet him once? Go and call him. - Meaning? Yes, go! Mr. Kailashnath. Thanks. I should thank you. God has given me everything. The love of these children. A sprawling business. But the house is lonely. Rajesh remembers his mother. But Prem has been deprived of a mother's love. Come in brother. Meet Professor and his wife. Hello. - Good day. Have a seat, son. What hobbies do you have other than work? He paints very well, isn't it? Is it? Just a little bit. Our daughter too paints very well. Pooja. Go. Yes Papa? - Show him your painting of the temple. Let's go see it! Let's go! We'll see the painting. Where are you going? - None of your business! Let them talk in peace. You talk to me. What do I talk to you? - Are you still angry with me? Nisha. Don't take my name! Mummy. - Daddy. It's beautiful. Thank you. You too paint. Yes, but not as beautifully. Give it to me. Did you like the painting? Since afternoon you've asked me this question every 15 minutes. What's the matter? - Matter? I'll get you tea in an earthen cup. Wait! Out with the truth. You won't hit me or scold me. Promise? - Promise. Liked the painting? - Yes. Liked the colours of the painting? Like the one who made the painting? Great! We brought you here only to hear this! Congratulations brother! Uncle! - Wait on! Brother has agreed! Pram. God day sire! Save me sister-in-law! "You're great Lord... what a pair you have created!" "Congratulations to my brother and bhabhi!" "More than any other ritual in this world..." "...the relation of hearts is the most important!" "Thanks to you, this event has seen the light of the day." "Congratulations to my sister and brother-in-law!" "More than any other ritual in this world..." "...the relation of hearts is the most important!" "You're great Lord!" "You're great Lord!" "You're great Lord!" "My brother, who is sitting so quietly..." "Bhabhi, have a look at his stubborn posture." "But he is a very good guy." "He is a very good guy but a bit naughty." "You're the only one that he has fallen for!" "My sister is acting tough now!" "Congratulations to my brother and bhabhi!" "More than any other ritual in this world..." "...the relation of hearts is the most important!" "You're great, Lord!" "You're great, Lord!" "You're great, Lord!" "Brother-in-law, for your sake..." "...my sister has prayed a lot!" "She's been to the temples..." "she's been to the temples, prayed day and night!" "She's been invoking Almighty all the time" "I've got a bhabhi as I had desired!" "Congratulations to my sister and brother-in-law!" "More than any other ritual in this world..." "...the relation of hearts is the most important!" "You're great, Lord!" "You're great, Lord!" "You're great, Lord!" Tuffy! Tuffy! Great Tuffy! What a garland you've brought! Even he knows that elder brother's in-laws are coming home today. And nothing will be lacking in their welcome! Right? Very good! Is your fiancee also coming? I'll just be back. What happened? - You'll always remain a fool. Why? Does a bride come to her husband's house before the marriage? How would I know? I'm not married. Get lost. Get.. Get lost. Yes? You are urgently required in the hall. Doctor is here too. Let him come. I ll take care of him. Hello doctor. - Hello. Why are you so angry? - You're asking me? Ask him this question! Chose a daughter-in-law, fixed Rajesh's wedding, and I hear it now! Doctor. - What is it? I don't want betel leaf! I am very angry today. Neither will I eat nor drink! Congratulations and good bye! Move aside. Her photograph is on the table. How do you find her? Her simplicity reminds me of a poem. Sit down. Doctor is reciting a poem! - Go ahead. It is said... - Excellent! Let me begin. I am floored seeing her picture. Wow, wow.. I am floored seeing her picture. My soul glows at my friend's good luck! Wow, wow.. Did you see that? Told me he's very angry. Wouldn't talk to anybody! And the anger evaporated seeing her photo! Have a seat. I can understand you being a heart specialist while your wife a child. But I don't get the poetic connection. Don't ask. That's a funny addiction. Why do you read poems? The poem's here with you and you read poems? What did you say? Wait, you rascal! The little boy talks big these days! Come here. Shall we get you married along with brother? Why ask for a good deed? Shameless. Hi! ' Sigh! I heard what she said. Now it's your turn to find a bride. Coming! Somebody is calling me. Whenever I want to talk to you, somebody calls you. But I know how to win your heart. How to make pudding. First the vessel. Pan. Where is it kept? Oh gosh! Stupid, I got hurt. I didn't know you were here. Shut up! Give me a vessel. Utensil. But what are you doing? - Making pudding. So it's for Prem? From the book? Don't touch. - Don't touch. Only answer what I ask you. Where is the semolina? - There. The butter? - Next to it. And sugar? - In that jar. Baby, listen.. - Shut up, stupid! Listen... - What? She's taken salt instead of sugar. Why don't you say something? - Forget it. She calls me stupid! Congratulations! Since I heard of Rajesh's engagement I'm excited! I've come straight from the temple. Coming from the beauty parlour! - What? Nothing. - Okay. I've heard the father is a professor in a college. Yes. - No dowry then. Like my husband he too would have only taught! No saving at all. - Don't say that. They have ancestral property. - Still they are his friends. He will take whatever they will give. If my Sweety would come, you'd get tired putting the dowry away! Rajesh is worth millions! - The pudding is worth millions! Baby is making it! - Baby is making it? Will you taste it? Let me taste it. - In a moment. Ready? I've praised your food outside. - Yes. I've praised your food outside. - Yes. Aunt wants to die... er taste it. - I'll take it to her. Excellent! You've learnt fast. Eat it with a large spoon. Baby has made it! Eat. Eat. What is it aunt? - She liked it very much. Eat it all! What was it? It was full of salt! Salt! - Yes! It's damn bitter! Your tongue has turned bitter. - What? I said the bride's parents are coming. Make over your face. Yes! Throw away that pudding! Listen, you can't make it. If not me, who else can make it? Good day. Welcome. Kailashnath, Live long. - And how are you? How are you son? And you? Hi! Nisha. - Hi! Welcome! Thanks. Computers. Studying computers? Wow! Lallu and Chameli have come to meet you. Good day. - Good day. And this is a dear one of our family. How sweet! He never bites. He only loves. Brother-in-law, show me your paintings. - Sure. Come here. Your father-in-law is a really interesting man. I'm coming. Prem, show her the paintings. Wow! Brother-in-law is great! This is so good. And this is beautiful. Beautiful. Come, I'll show you his most beautiful painting. Please come. Chocolate? - Oh! Chocolate! Thank you. Please come. How is it? Do you know how to play or just striking a pose? People say I play very well. Would you like to listen? I almost forgot. Sister sent this gift for you. Sister-in-law sent it? Wow! I did dissuade her but... Open it. Wow! Broach! Stick it in your coat. Girl friends will be impressed. Nisha. Nisha, Help me pin it. Move. Sony. Did it hurt? Then? - Simply. It felt like it did. Very smart. What's the matter? - It pricked this time. It hurts like this when it pricks. You are both being called. The ceremonies have begun. Come, let's go in. It's time for the relation to be confirmed. Very smart. Now Rajesh belongs to us. Let's hug today. Time won't be mine from tomorrow. Why? - The girl is ours. We have to bend. We won't let you both get away with just a hug. Then? - Song and dance. No problem. Get the instrument. Everybody is ready, but who will begin? Today is your day so one of you sing and let the other play. Let us hear something. - Me? I'm a simple man. You're the exciting one. Leave it. Shall I spill the beans? - No. Why not? You always spilled ours! This happened when we used to study together. Kailashnath, me and my wife. Even today she has a wonderful smile. But in those days everyone was crazy for one look from her. I'll be back. - Where are you going? So where everyone was her fan, your uncle too was included. Oh! - Uncle you? No! Don't lie! For the love of this shyness, sing something for that smile. Explain to your father-in-law. No! No! One minute. Listen. On my behalf request him. It will carry more weight. Sing something. Great! "In my heart today." "There's this strange conflict in my heart today" "I'm singing and my in-law is in front of me." "I'd like to say something that is on her heart too" "I'm singing and my in-law is in front of me." "The earrings on her ears look like the moon and the sun!" "The earrings on the ears look like the moon and the sun!" "This 'Banarasi' sari looks great too!" "I'll tell you a secret..." "I'll tell you a secret." "My in-law is tickled even today when her anklets make a noise." "It's a secret... he is tickled even today when her anklets make a noise." "The smile on her lips... the shyness of her eyes!" "The smile on her lips... the shyness of her eyes!" "Such innocence is a boon!" "I'll tell you a secret... I'll tell you a secret." "My in-law is truly blessed! She is like 'Laxmi' the goddess of wealth..." "...who has transformed this house into heaven!" "My in-law is truly blessed!" "She is like 'Laxmi' the goddess of wealth..." "...who has transformed this house into heaven!" "There's this strange conflict in my heart today..." "I'm singing and my in-law is in front of me." "What I have to live up to is a very delicate relationship!" "I'm singing and my in-law is in front of me." "She's my shade who's moving into your house." "She's my shade who's moving into your house." "She's lived like a dream on my eyelids!" "I'll tell you a secret..." "I'll tell you a secret." "This life time earnings of mine..." "is the brilliance of your lawn henceforth." "I'll tell you a secret... This life time earnings of mine." "is the brilliance of your lawn henceforth." "I'll tell you a secret... This life time earnings of mine." "is the brilliance of your lawn henceforth." I think my sister will starve here. Why? - Because he pecks at his food. Then you feed him. - Open your mouth. If you feed him right now what will you do for the wedding? That you'll know when you arrive there. And you will come. - Of course. When we come, there'll be fireworks. Pass it here. Brother! Brother! What is it? - Do us a favour. Sit here. - I'm busy. The groom is almost here. If you help us, I'll tell your mother who is my aunt to... To find you a pretty bride! Then here goes. Sorry brother. You'll ask your sister's husband to sit over here? No, he'll sit there. This seat is for his brothers. Let them know how we welcome our guests! Come, I'll introduce you to all. Shall we take a group picture? - Sure. Why not? He's my wife's brother's son. - Greetings. Good day. - Greetings. That's enough son. He's doing research on Kalidas's Shakuntala. He's also looking for his own Shakuntala, isn't it? Take the picture. It will be best on the staircase. Thank you! Thank you! Come son. Come on. Let's go. Good, it's incense. Tuffy. Tuffy. Stupid! Shakuntala! Come with us. - Where are you taking him? He'll sit with us. They want to meet him. Then take him. You too. - We? You too will be looked after. Something seems fishy. I love fish. - What do we do? Let's check it out. Brothers, we shall return. Come. Listen... What is it? - Don't go there. Why? It's dangerous. Danger! Please sit. Please sit. - We sit here? Come fast. Sit. There won't be any sound when you sit. Okay- What did you say? Nothing. You may sit. - Fine. Wait. First we'll investigate. May we? - Sure! Is everything in order? - Yes it is. Then take a seat. - We will, on one condition. First you girls will sit. How is that possible? You are guests. You sit. No! We are gentlemen. Ladies first. What's the matter? - Your sweet sisters-in-law... One has to tread carefully in their presence! Papad! I'll get back. - Listen. Before you go, tell me where do I sit? Come with me. I'll give you the most special seat. Come. Don't feel shy. Come. You may sit there. What happened? What news have you brought? They have hidden the groom's shoes in a red and yellow sweet box. Okay- A, B,C, D,E, F,G. Why are we stealing the shoes? Stealing is a sin. - This is auspicious. We'll get money for stealing them. I see! - Yes. A red and yellow sweet box. Now watch the fun. We've found such a place to hide the shoes that nobody will guess it! Shut the box. We have enough enemies here. See she is coming here. Is your name Prem? - Yes. There's a call for you. - Call for me? Be alert. I'll return soon. Come. Thank you. Hello! - Hello! Guessed? Suman here. Which Suman? Listen... - Yes. Yes. The boy sitting next to you has called you. I see. You go ahead. I'm coming. Be alert. I'll be back soon. Will you make friends with us? This is Muniya and this is Gudiya. Now bye. Ok. Bye. Come on. Quickly hide it there. Believe me. I don't know any Suman or her Dad. I fell in love with her? When? In my previous birth? - Yes. Tell me what do you think of Nisha for this birth. Hung UP? Girls are so possessive. What are you doing here? - Waiting for you to finish talking. You called me? - Yes... me? Yes, you called me. Calls and then denies it. Dead meat! Thank God! I was scared. I'll check it. They are sweets. - What crap! The shoes turned to sweets! Give me. - Have a look. Only sweets look nice in a sweet box. These girls made fools out of us! Gave up so soon? - Me and accept defeat? I will be back. Don't lose hope. Dear good Lord! You are truly great. You perform the greatest miracles. Do something whereby we win the game and they look like fools. Do something Lord! It will open up! Want to embarrass me before everyone? I think he wants to take us some place. Maybe he knows where the shoes are. Come on. Good boy Tuffy! Okay. Tu"!!- Lord you are great! Come on! Here are the shoes! - Well done. Now hide this box in its' place. Now listen hide the shoes in such a place that they can never find it! Absolutely not! Okay let's fix it at 500. Absolutely not! We'll return his shoes only when we get 1001 bucks, right? You won't get such an opportunity again. Demand what you want. Keep sitting with no shoes! You're sitting with the kids? Come on, it's getting late. Late? Absolutely not. Say with me. 1001 bucks... Cash! - Yes! Now I'll have to get up. Are you getting married? - No child, I... Then quietly sit down. They are very sharp. - Really. Where is the tiger? - I am here. You are funny! Instead of helping us you're eating a papaya! Say something. - First you fix the deal. Then we'll speak, right? What do you say? - Look, kids... Absolutely not! - You might as well pay them. Just a minute uncle. Tell them to give the shoes and then take the money. Fair enough. Give with one hand and take with the other. That's fantastic Prem. - All right. Fine. We'll get the shoes. Girls follow me. A beautiful gift for a beautiful girl. Sister.. Who has taken the shoes? "You sisters-in-law of the groom with the green drapes." "You sisters-in-law of the groom with the green drapes." "Return the shoes and take the cash." "Return the shoes and take the cash."

If I've made any mistakes... Forgive me. Live long and may your husband live forever. Come dear. - Come in. You come here. Where are you off to? You're responsible for this! Saw what they gave as dowry? They gave just too much! A diamond necklace, imported car. Did you take it? - No, actually what happened... When we weighed all these things they were not an iota of the bride. So we left it behind. And were you just watching? What's this? I have to give something when she touches my feet. You give her this book! Had my Sweety come, I'd give a gold chain! This belonged to Rajesh' mom Now you must keep it. That's enough. May you live long! This is for you. I'm giving you the Ramayana. Sita resides in it. The doctor gives a ring studded with precious stones. I bless both of you to always remain together thus. Terrific! - This is for you. But uncle... - Shut up! Uncle! Why are you looking at him? Forgot when you'd take 25 paise from me while going to school? Has he become very wealthy because he has grown up? Don't scold him in front of his wife. I'll scold him in front of his children too! Rita.. This is for you. Distribute the rest. Come here. This is Lallu. My son. Take this. No, you've given me so much respect such a nice sister-in-law. I want nothing else. Take it from Pooja. You said she resembles your sister-in-law. Think it is she giving it to you. And what do I get? Give the little guy something. - He gets a duty. A sister-in-law loves her brother-in-law the most. So keep in mind that she should never miss her parental home. Understood. Yes, I have understood, uncle. I promise that. I'll give her every happiness. Hi, sister-in-law, What's happening? - She is educating me. Write Jawaharlal Nehru. Should I write it with a J or G? - With a Z. Fooling me! - Who studies on Sundays? I do. - Let's play cricket. She won't go anywhere. - Come here. What happened? After so long I've got brother to play cricket. Understood you fool? Sister-in-law" - What? We'll continue studying tomorrow. Now it's playing time. Come on. - But I can't play. Then just sit. - Yes, sister-in-law. There are clouds in the sky.. - Hi, sister-in-law! Hi! " Bye! Your batting, brother. Sister-in-law, catch. Come on Lallu. What's going on? - Let's play. Little this way. Field well. Are you through with your fielding? - Take this, big brother. - Hey Prem. Just sitting is not allowed in the cricket grounds. You have to play. Oh! Fine. You'll have to bowl. Me and bowl? - It's my prestige at stake. No. Please Prem. It's easy. Just do this and this. That's it. Audience, applause for our new member. Clap. Come on. Our new player walks towards the pitch. Welcome, sister-in-law. Best of luck! Best of luck, sister-in-law. The best sister-in-law of India. I have said something wrong. Umpire, ready? How's that?! All eyes are on our newest player who has clean bowled the opposition! Now it's your turn. Our new player walks on. Bat, please. Gloves, please. Shall we? - Please. Ball, please. The match takes an exciting twist. Our established player has decided to take revenge. Wasim Akram. The new player has settled on the crease with confidence. Come on, sister-in-law! And there goes the ball! It flies into the sky, crosses the boundary and... How's that?! How's that?! No Ball. Tuffy! You turncoat! "Bhabhi, you're the treasure house of happiness!" "From the time the first rays show up..." "...my bhabhi is awake from that time." "She takes care of all and works till late in the evening." "From the time the first rays show up..." "...my bhabhi is awake from that time." "I've been missing all this since childhood!" Sister-in-law! "I'll be married too!" "All of them seem to be telling me so." "You make a choice and don't listen to anyone" "I'll be married too!" "All of them seem to be telling me so." "You search for a replica of yourself and get her here." "Till when should I be the youngest?" "Let someone younger than me come too." "Give these arms of mine a laughing and talking toy!" "Till when should I be the youngest?" "Let someone younger than me come too." "We ask of you for a lovely offering!" "Bhabhi, you're the treasure house of happiness." Come in. - Everything done. I've even told the confectioner that our grandchild is on its way. Everything should be ready in time for the function. Good day everyone. Good day. Uncle, I've brought for you fresh and refreshing tea. Very Good! Please! You've taught him English and made him an Englishman! Englishman! What does a monkey know of the taste of ginger! Auntie, this is for you. Ginger tea. What? - Ginger tea. Okay. Give it to me. But.. - Oh, henna problem? No problem. For you tea with straw. Excellent! The tea is brewed well, isn't it? But why are you laughing so hard? - Do some work. Let's call up and ask when your parents will come for the function. Hello! Who is it? It's you. Yes? - Your sister wants to talk to you. Sister-in-law. Hello! Nisha, Hi! - Hi would be mother. How are you? Talk to Mummy. Hello Pooja! Live long dear. It looks as if we might not make it to the function. Can't make it? Talk to uncle. Good day. What's the matter? The exams in her Dad's college have got postponed to this date. But somebody must come. Nishaji! Calling Nishaji.. At least send Nisha. Just a second. Will you go? To sister? - Nisha will come over. Fine. Prem will come tomorrow to pick her up. Will you go? Yes, I will. Nisha! Nisha! Get up dear and get dressed. What, Mummy! What a girl! Get up. Prem will be here soon. I've selected your clothes. Put them in the suitcase. Take this. On your way, first go to Ramtekri. And light a lamp there. Got it? Why? What does that mean? Do I have to tell you everything? Now you will go to your sister's house, learn how to run a home. Then you too will get married. I won't get married. Initially every girl says this. Dear, your chocolate days are gone! "Chocolate, lime juice, ice cream, toffees..." "...my choices are not the same as before." "Dolls and toys, my friends..." "...they all seem like a riddle to me now!" "What is this new twist to my life?" "Chocolate, lime juice, ice cream, toffees..." "...my choices are not the same as before." "Dolls and toys, my friends..." "...they all seem like a riddle to me now!" "What is this new twist to my life? What is this madness?" "How do I know? How do I know?" "I'm finding it difficult to recognize myself." "My nights don't seem to get over." "Who do I tell about all these things?" "Dolls and toys, my friends..." "...they all seem like a riddle to me now!" "What is this new twist to my life?" "My mind is racing with new thoughts... how's that?" "I wasn't the way I am today." "Buds have started to bloom in my way." "My eyes are searching for the lanes of my dream." "Dolls and toys, my friends..." "...they all seem like a riddle to me now!" "What is this new twist to my life?" "What is this new twist to my life?" Your slave is here. Hi! . Hi! Tuffy' Shit, I love her. Nisha ji, thank you so much. Thanks for what? - For waiting for me. I wasn't waiting for you. So you were counting the stars on the terrace in the daytime. It is said that pretty girls look even more pretty when they lie. Son, you've come? Hello, auntie! How are you and where's uncle? Good morning, son. Piping hot cutlets with grams. Have a bite. Did you make it? - Yes, it's your aunt's favourite. Gravy with butter equals to wife being happy. She's not talking to me for 2 days. Why? - The first child of our daughter... and we're not going. I'll take you in style when the child is born. Taste this. Hold her hand. Shall I ask a question? Why have you given me flowers? Because we've only fought whenever we've met. What could be better than flowers to make up? Why did you apologise to me after the wedding ceremony? Creating an impression. You'll laugh if I tell you the truth. I won't. Please tell me. We were taking the bride home. You were sending your sister away. I thought of giving you a gift when we were leaving. Saw that Tuffy? Nobody values a genuine man! I'm not laughing at you. Sometimes we misjudge people. You are not at all like I thought you were in the first meeting. How am I? - I'll think when I'm free. There's a surprise for you at the back. Surprise? Take a look. Chocolates?! For you. - May I ask what's the occasion. Flowers and chocolates? Anything special? For the first time a girl is allowed in the front seat of my car. People say this day comes in everyone's life. Now it has come my way. Nisha ji. What happened? - Nothing. I'm sharing my secrets with you and you're reading a comic! Reading not allowed while travelling! We must laugh and talk. What Tuffy? Yes. And since I heard you sing on the terrace, I'm a fan of your voice. Share some secrets with me. Some other time. - Why? I have a sore throat. Before the third comic is opened I'll have to create an impression. 10! 9! 8! 7! 5! 5! 4! 3! 2! 1! Let's start the fun. "The drapes are flying in the cold breeze." "The heart is beating fast, it's because of the teen age." "No control over the heart..." "what sort of magic is this?" "This the magic of the season, dear!" "No control over the heart now, dear!" "My gaze has lost and gone insane..." "...the sight of you is so breathtaking." "This the magic of the season, pal!" "This fair girl with the city boy..." "...looks like the shining moon!" "These beautiful flowers and the buds..." "...this naughty call of the wind!" "These beautiful flowers and the buds..." "...this naughty call of the wind!" "They signal to me to spend my time over here." "Previously, never ever would these flowers talk to me this way!" "This the magic of the season, dear!" "Dear.." "No control over the heart, dear!" "My gaze has lost and gone insane..." "...the sight of you is so breathtaking." "This the magic of the season, dear!" "Tell the truth and don't keep it a secret." "From where have you'll come and where do you want to go?" "I'm taking her with me to my place." "I'm taking her with me to my place." "Well, a strange acquaintance and a strange place!" "Why then have you come so far with me, my dear?" "This the magic of the season, dear!" "Dear.." "No control over the heart, pal!" "My gaze has lost and gone insane..." "...the sight of you is so breathtaking." "This the magic of the season, dear!" "Dear.." Sister! Hi! Nisha. - Hi! Careful! Hi! Chameli. - Nishaji. Nisha child.. - Uncle. - You've come dear? Welcome.

What do you say, Miss Nisha.. I mean, brother. Doctor uncle.. - Yes? - Once more, please! Okay- The moments of wait seem eternal. My eyes are laid out on the path of my beloved. The heart says appreciate the beauty of your beloved. Who has brought this angel down from the heavens? Excellent! - Terrific! Will you guys remain here only? We were leaving. Come on. Your tea and snacks are laid out in the lawn. We have to begin the function. Come on girls. May we accompany you? Sony! Gents not allowed. Uncle is this ladies program really good? Yes. - How do you know? We used to hide and watch it when we were small. We used to wear ladies clothes and join the crowd! Doctor, what say? Uncle, shame. Shame. But you kids are decent! Our elders are very naughty. We would never do that, right? Shall we go? Now begin your program. Aunt... Hello. Why are you sitting here? Dearest aunt, we want to watch. What? - Bhola wants to see it. Who wants to watch? - One moment. This is a ladies function. Please go out. We will meet outside.. We're going. Son, don't listen to them.

Excuse me! Excuse me! What's going on? - Carry on aunt. We'll take a close up of aunt. My close up? Sure. Just a minute. What trick is this?

"Oh Lord, he's trying to impress the girls." "It's sort of a habit with him.." "it's sort of a habit with him." "Oh Lord, he's trying to impress the girls."

"Oh Lord, he's trying to impress the girls." "Sister, your brother-in-law is crazy." "Oh Lord, he's trying to impress the girls." "I told him to get some mountain mud..."

"Oh Lord, it's the age of girls!" "Oh Lord, it's the age of girls!" Where are you going? Is it nice to hide and watch girls? What's the point if one can't see you dance? Now I'm a fan of your dance too. Didn't you feel offended we made fun of you? Nothing you do offends me. Why? What has happened? Whatever you say and do... I like everything. Then why did you hit me with a catapult? It is bad manners. Next time think twice before hitting another girl. Who has the time to think about others? I can only be impudent with you. What do I mean to you? Shall I tell you? Son, it's exam time. One, two. Is anybody watching? What were you saying? - Nothing my mother! I... Hello.. I love her. Yes. Where's uncle? - In the study. Why? Come, I'll tell you. A fax has just come from abroad. Our collaborators loved our scheme! Wow! Bother, you have done it. Is this meant for Prem? - Yes, he's worked hard for it. Very good! They've called me for final talks. Plan out my trip. Is my luggage ready? - Yes. Your wife is packing some eats. What's all this? - It's packed. You have to take it. You'll have to take this overcoat too. Shall we go Rajesh? - Uncle.. You won't come to the airport so late in the night. Once Tuffy and I fix a program, it is fixed. It will be an outing for me son. I'm waiting in the car. It's time for the flight. Come on, 'MM! See you. Take care. What's the matter? Your wife will deliver anytime now. At this time she needs you more than anyone else. And at such a moment you have to leave her alone. And go abroad because of me. So this bothers you. Come with me. See what your brother-in-law says. - What's the matter? What's wrong? - Says delivery is at any time. And at such a time I have to go abroad because of him. We all have dreams for you. That you progress in life. Make a name for yourself. Your brother is going to give shape to this dream. As for me, with you around, do I need to worry about anything? A sister-in-law's best friend is her brother-in-law. Let's go brother. The food cooked by you was delicious! Wonderful! Both sisters are alike. Good in everything. Be happy. Rajesh left quite some time back. Any news of his return? I spoke to him this morning. The work is almost done. That's great. I've given him a list. You're funny! He's working and you've given him a list of nail paint! So what? He's my dear nephew. You shower him with love. - What? Nothing. I understand everything that you keep mumbling to yourself! Auntie, some Aniseed. Thank you. Okay. Bye. Come home! Thank you very much. You saved me or your aunt would have begun world war III. I'll make a move. Good night. Good night everybody! - Good night! You too must rest. It's quite late. Prem will be on his way back. He'll be late. Since Rajesh left, he's looking after the office. He might be late. Take her to her room. Call up Prem and find out when he's coming home. This service station.. Shift it to no. 10 block.. Excuse me.. Hello. Who is it? Yes? Your sister-in-law asks when you'll be home. I'll be late. Tell her to rest. Ask Lallu to cook my meal. As for you.. Thank you very much for calling! Yes Mr. Ramnathan and Mr. D'Souza, lets continue. That was my mother. No jokes when we work. Plot number 10 has got to be a service station. This is my home. My home is very beautiful.. Lallu.. - Brother.. You've come? - Yes, got late today. Has sister-in-law slept? - Since ages. Good. Shall I lay dinner? - Yes, I'm famished. In a minute. I'll roast the parathas. You haven't slept? Dinner. From where do I begin? You take so long to decide on vegetables. How do you work? Start from here. Your favourite sweet. How do you know I love it? Excuse me. Piping hot parathas. So you told her about the sweet? I have to be honest if somebody asks your choice. She cooked dinner today. - You did? Eat it and see. I'm sleepy. Come on, Tuffy! It's sleeping time. Why interfere? You fool. Good night. Good night. You have magic in your hands. This is the best pudding I've eaten. No jokes, honest. You must be thinking he's mad. Loves your singing. Your dancing and now even cooking! You didn't answer my question. Why did you stay up for me? Do you know your bad quality? You talk too much when you eat. Oh! Really? Is that $0? I am sorry! You have another weakness. You listen to people very easily. You are really funny. When I want to ask you something, you hold me back. And when I keep quiet, you prod me. Now may I ask you something? What do I mean to you? "It's the first love.. It's the first time." "It's the first love.. It's the first time." "In spite of knowing this, my love acts so strange!" "It's the first love.. It's the first time." "Her looks.. Looks at me from the corner of her eyes." "Her looks.. Her shyness..." "...they reveal the secret of her liking.. Her shyness." "One who will serve without being noticed.. My love is that type!" "It's the first love.. It's the first time." "She is Nisha.. She is the direction of my life." "She is Nisha.. She knows..." "..that she controls my life.. She knows that." "My love is cut off from the whole world!" "It's the first love.. It's the first time." "It's the first love... it's the first time." Somebody is coming. Brother. - What's the matter? Call doctor aunt. We may have to take her to the hospital. Congratulations it's a boy! Uncle, now I'm an uncle! Prem! Congratulations! "Everyone will have to sing today." "Bhabhi, I thank you." "Let's all get together and thank her." "My eyes were longing for this sight. My dreams have come true." "God willing, you too may have a poetic attitude!" "Childhood days have returned!" "This mute animal too is happy knowing that.." "..there'll be a lovely sound echoing around this lawn now." "Tuffy is asking the child to keep on smiling always!" Please sing. "Grandma and grandpa will dance too!" "We've got some hot food." "Get it fast, we're hungry." "We've put in the spices with lots of love." "Taste it first or else you might have to regret." Wow! "You do the cooking from tomorrow." "Your head will break with this bouncer" "I will hit it for a six." "Think before you lift your bat. Don't be clean bowled." "Catch it or you'll lose the match." "The fool has won the match." "Listen to what the kid is saying." "He's asking you to be closely related to him." "Son, this uncle of yours is up to something" "if I don't get her, I'm sure to renounce life and become a priest." "Come home and take the alms." "Live long, child. The child is very lucky." "These fireworks.. This brightness..." "They reveal the happiness of the heart!" "The earth and the sky are happy for our baby." "And it's apt that at such time, the father of the child arrives." This is the model of Prem's factory. You began this work from a room. Rajesh expanded it to this form. And Prem will take it to the skies. Work hard. We won't be there the inauguration of your factory. Where are you going? - Back home. We're booked by the evening train. - Are you leaving today? We were waiting for Rajesh to return. Now we must leave. Do something. Hold them back. What's this I hear? Professor is leaving? That too today! - Today? Brother, listen. You didn't ask them to stay? - Absolutely not! No, their tickets are reserved. They can be cancelled. I'll see how they leave. Uncle, you are so sweet! - Doctor...! You wait here. Listen, Prem. - The paper. Come in doctor. All set to leave? Yes. We really enjoyed our stay together. Show me the ticket. Cancel them. You are strange! Your son-in-law just returned and you're off! I wanted to stay for a couple of months but... It's the daughter's home. That maybe but first it's my friend's home! Now even if you get annoyed, we won't let you leave today. Spend some time with Rajesh too. - Please stay back. Please. - But.. Please stay back. - Okay. This luggage should be...!! One minute. We'll stay back on one condition. What's that? Nobody will sleep tonight. We'll have a wild party! You just watch what a ball we'll have! It will be out of this world. The night is beautiful. It's a party of friends. Wow, wonderful. Stop these poems and get in the mood of games. How long will we sit here? Tell us what to do. It is going to be fun. Attention everyone. A very easy game. Bhola will play music. And we'll pass this cushion around. When the music stops... Whoever is holding the cushion is caught. We'll punish him as we deem fit. Okay? ' Okay. Dearest aunt of mine, where are you slinking away? You have to begin the game. I'm won't get caught. I'll sit there and see there's no cheating. And I'll look after him. What style! My father had a gramophone. Do you remember that song? - Yes. Thanks dear. - "We should build a beautiful bungalow.." "We should build a beautiful bungalow.." Should I begin? Yes, start. Lallu got caught! But... - Stand up. I'll go to fill water. What do I do master? - You've learnt English. Say something. - One minute. Jawahar Lal Nehru was born on 14th November 1889. He was our first prime minister. He loves children very much. Children used to say 'Hail uncle Nehru.' Jai Hind. Applause! Brother got caught! What do we make him do? - I won't do anything. What? - No way. Brother-in-law, this is not fair. Don't be a spoil sport. - Yes brother. Okay I'll say something in your honour. Whether she be fair or dark... Fortunate is the man who has a sister-in-law. Then? The man with a sister-in-law gets double joy. Keeps an eye on the sister-in-law while he talks to his wife! Are you listening? - Yes. Says the poet Rajesh, nectar is the cup of joy. But a sister-in-law is half a wife! What is this? - He's caught but he didn't take it. How convenient! - Are you watching, judge? Sister-in-law, no cheating. No cheating. No cheating. - Come on. Father, Mughal-e-Azam. Oh great. - What is this Mughal-e-Azam? - Whom are you watching? Shy of your son-in-law? He's like your own son. Sister-in-law, Please let us hear. Lights off! Anarkali.. - Hey professor. She's there. So what did Anarkali say to Prince Saleem?

You never called them. - You be quiet. You don't invite close ones. - We promise to come next time. Shall we leave? It's almost time. Can't see Kailashnath. - One minute. Let us send you off properly. This is for you. But our gift? Enough. Nisha's mother.. The heart is so crazy. It expects much more than it gets. We held you back for one day. Now I wish we could do it again. Brother, do one job for me. Get a picture of us taken with Nisha. We'll remember how she lovingly stayed with us for so many days. One for me too, master. Me too. - I too will get one taken. All right. Prem.. Get the camera son. Going? Now there's no excuse for me to hold you back. Shall I ask you something? Will you answer honestly? What?

You are called immediately. But... - Prepare to leave. You'll get the afternoon bus. I'll help you pack. Whom are you giving this money to? Lallu. It will help in the treatment. I know these servants well. This sickness is an excuse, a scheme to grab money! Such telegrams are sold a dime a dozen! Neither will the money return nor... It was my job to alert you. But you may do as you please. Servants! I swear and tell you that this telegram is not false. I have been falsely accused. Because I am a small man. When did you become small? You call me sister-in-law, don't you? - Yes. Then keep this. I am scared. If something happens in the village...? Nothing will happen. Come with me. I am confident nothing will happen to her. Go. When your sister-in-law gets well.. First of all tell her, you've found Chameli for yourself. So you're off? Why don't you come along? I'll come to take you. Come on. Let me drink tea first. Uncle it's getting late. - Give baby to me once. Only one chance. So you are ready to go? Lallu left yesterday and you're leaving today. What will I do? That is why I say, now that the factory has begun... Get me a co-sister. Well said! Very well said. A Sister-in-law should be like this. What times! From today it's your job to find him a bride. I love you sister-in -law. What's the matter? I'm going home but you're chirping? Has the weather turned magical because we talked of your marriage? I love you, sister-in-law. Now some serious talk. Uncle has put your reins in my hand. Would sir prefer a love or an arranged marriage? Love marriage which you must arrange. What? - I love you, sister-in-law. Heard that son? Your uncle is two steps ahead of your Dad. He's already found you an aunt. He approves of her. He has seen her photo, right son? What do you say, little one? Say yes. Show me too. Why photo? I'll show you her face. You mean your beloved is on our way? It's on the way, Sister-in-law, on the way. Our destination has arrived. But where is yours? - Our destinations are the same. Sister-in-law, welcome. Not here. Come in. Sit down. Think it's your own house. What's all this? - First read this. Mummy, Papa have gone out. They will return by evening. Have something to eat. Got it! Meaning you and your madam fixed this plan earlier. What romance! Call up your brother. - Why? Let me give him the good news. - Where are your feet? Call up. Is brother in? - No. He's out on urgent work. - He's gone out! Leave a message. - Tell him to call here fast. Yes. Now get UP- And place this necklace around Nisha's neck. How can I do that? Your shy sister is not coming down. If she won't come down, let us go up to her. We're the groom's side. We'll take the bridal procession! "I'm leaving..." "I'm going with my brother-in-law's marriage procession." "I'm going with my brother-in-law's marriage procession." "No music, nobody else, only the message of happiness" "I'm going with my brother-in-law's marriage procession." "Brother-in-law becomes the groom and wears the turban on the head." "Sister-in-law gives him her blessings." "The buds of love blossom and we get happiness all the time." "I bless you from the bottom of my heart." "Astride a horse, this groom goes to get his bride." "I'm going with my brother-in-law's marriage procession." "That's great Lord! What a pair you have created!" "Brother-in-law and sister-in-law.. Congratulations." "More than any other ritual in this world..." "...the relation of hearts is the most important." "The all-important moment has arrived." "Till yesterday I was only the daughter-in-law of the house." "I will command and I will stare too." "And she'll just watch with awe." "I come with a thousand dreams" "I'm leaving..." I'm leaving with my brother-in-law's marriage procession". Must be your brother. Hold the baby Nisha. Sister-in-law! She's saying something. Injection Atropine. Fast! Do something! What's the matter? I am sorry. Eat it. The one who fed you will never return now. She was heartless. Showered us with love for sometime and departed. Eat my child. Have courage. - God knows what magic this girl had. Without her, we've forgotten how to live! Forgotten how to live! Stop. How are you? Here. A miracle took place. The doctors had given up hope. Sister-in-law could not recover. But I was sure nothing would happen to her. Pooja had prayed for her. And that's what happened! She opened her eyes and smiled. I told her this is the miracle of the one who always blesses me. I'll go and tell Pooja the good news. That hand is no more on our heads. Elder brother, what happened? Master! She sacrificed herself for our tears. She gave my sister-in-law the gift of life in her blessings! Ask God why He calls good people to Himself? Why? Ask Him! She was a goddess of affection. She had a bounty of love within. Even the Lord needs love. He too needs love! The baby had a right over that love that you talk of! Now what happens to him? Brother, What will happen to the baby? Answer me. Put him to bed in the crib. Has he slept? - Trying to. He thinks his aunt is his mother. If we are missing Pooja so much... What must Rajesh be going through? Rajesh is not well. He may not say anything but we all can see it. He is being eaten up by worries. And the reason is the baby's upbringing. But what is the solution? There is one way. We must get him married again. Professor, The strange thing about life is that it never halts. The breath stops but not life. A mother is essential for a baby. Very important. I feel, find a chance and talk to him about it. Drop me to the dispensary. I'll send medicines for Rajesh. So long, professor. He is absolutely right. Rajesh, Son, you needn't worry about your baby's future. Listen to me and get married again. You are still young. And you'll get good proposals. Why go far? Sweety is willing. Had he married her then, we wouldn't see this day! Wife! - You be quiet. I've even talked to Sweety. She has only one condition. A maid looks after the baby. - What? Ayah looks after him? Yes. -Brother, I beg you don't give baby to a woman who doesn't know motherhood. Don't interfere! - He is right. Your choice doesn't possess the quality of being a mother. To accept another's child, one has to know one's culture! Listen...! - He is right. What right! He is only abusing my niece! Who would like to rear another's kid? Under these circumstances who will give him their daughter? I ask you will you give your daughter Nisha to Rajesh? Stop it! That's the limit! - Don't lecture me! What's wrong in Sweety's condition? Such a big racket for one infant! Children grow up on their own. - Wife! It's probably because of this nature of yours we don't have kids. I am sorry! Sorry! No uncle. I can't bring a step mother for baby. All step mothers are not bad. Brother! No, I won't remarry. Come in Professor. Rajesh refuses to get married. He is also right. How can we give away our heart to a stranger? Pooja's memories are enough for baby and me. That's true for all of us. But some day you have to get married. Today we all are here to look after him, his grandfather... But we won't always be around. You need support at every stage of life. And then bringing up a child is a big responsibility. A mother can come for baby... Who will come but snatch him away. For him such a mother will come... Who will be his own. What if Nisha comes here in place of Pooja? Nisha always talks about this place. And the baby is always with her. Prepare yourself. If anyone can take Pooja's place... It is her sister. What do you say? Accept it brother. - The baby will get a mother. Ask Nisha first. I thought it right and spoke to Kailashnath about Nisha's match. If Nisha goes there as a bride and Pooja's house settles again... What could be better than that? Let me ask Pooja once. If she accepts... We'll get her married grandly. There should be nothing lacking from our side because she is no more. What do you want dear? - Whatever you deem fit. I'll call up Kailashnath. Hello, Kailashnath. Nisha has accepted. I'll call the priest and fix the wedding soon. That's true. Absolutely. "O mother, the crow on your roof foretells that..." "...your darling daughter has renounced this house..." "..and has fallen in love with a stranger!" Good day. Welcome. All ready? - Cards too are printed. We were on our way to Ramtekri. Thought we'd see the baby. Where is baby? - He's with Nisha. Get him. - In a moment. How is Nisha? - Fine. Getting her hands hennaed. Aunt has called the baby down. Shall we take him? Yes. Carefully. Don't worry. See what's in my hand. Your wedding card. - Read it out. By the grace of God, our daughter Nisha... ...is to wed Rajesh. You are welcome.. What are you reading? Read properly. I am reading properly. By the grace of God our daughter Nisha is to wed Rajesh. Please come with your family to bless the couple. Give it to me. - What's wrong? "O mother, the crow on your roof foretells that..." "...your darling daughter has renounced this house..." "..and has fallen in love with a stranger!" "You had taken a religious vow for my wedding..." "...now you should get me engaged with that sage..." "...apply henna on these hands..." "...apply henna on these hands..." "...and tie the auspicious thread of the ritual..." Uncle... "..and has fallen in love with a stranger!" You have obliged us greatly by agreeing to marry Rajesh. You've given the gift of life to both of them. A new life. See. What happened? - She was fine. Open your eyes. - Call a doctor. Nisha.. She is absolutely fine. I've given her an injection. She'll be fine in no time. But suddenly...? - Must be tired due to the wedding. Don't worry. I'll take leave. We'll also make a move. Okay- Come to me baby. Okay. - Greetings. I wanted to meet Nisha once. - Go up. I don't want to disturb her. Give this to her. Fine. The step that you have taken for baby... I'm grateful to you for it. Everybody is very happy with this decision. But I know every girl has some dreams, some desires. If there is any hesitation in your mind, do tell me. Nothing matters more than your happiness. Hello. Who? "I will erase memories of love from my heart." "For my duties, I shall forget everything." "You have a duty to discharge." "But how will I repay this favour of yours?" "In reverence to you..." "I will bow my head" "I will bow my head." Give me your grandchild. Come to uncle. Come in son. Lord! The Lord with the flute. What game are you playing? Prem has bound me by oath. Made me helpless. But you are not helpless. Lord perform some miracle... That people start believing in you again. And they have faith in you. Sister had adorned our love for each other with this necklace. She wanted her co-sister to wear it. I am returning it. Give this to Prem. Come here Rajesh. Sister had adorned our love with this necklace. She wanted her co-sister to wear it. I'm returning it. What is this? Saw 'mat Pooh'? What these two set out to do? What would I answer you if this step had been taken? What's wrong Rajesh? Why did you come upstairs? Read this and tell me if it is fair. This beloved son of yours who always asked me every little thing... ...hid such a big thing in his heart! Hid it behind his smile. Made me an outsider today! No, what you did was wrong! After Pooja passed away, I had only one desire. The baby should not miss his mother. I ask you, if you had accepted the baby as an aunt... Would your love have been reduced? Answer me. Silly girl! You were out to ruin your life and happiness. Son, you should be proud of them. They did what they thought was their duty. Now I'll do my duty. Pooja's incomplete dream. Actually it's my fault. I couldn't understand. What you tried to tell me before departing. I have a request. Give Nisha's hand to Prem. I probably did some good deeds in a previous birth. I'm blessed by getting such a son-in-law! I am blessed. "We all admire you today!" "I'm so full of happiness!" "What else can my heart ask for?" "I've got everything that I could ever ask for!"
