Don't do it! - This has gone too far! - What the fuck are we doing? It's gotta stop! Last chance, Captain. [men screaming] [drill whirring] Password, you fucking...! Password! Oh my God! Patrol 414... Patrol 414. You fucking animal! Jesus! It says 2.4 million. [Simon groaning] Look, it says it! There's 2.4 million. Well we should take only what we are due. No, we take the lot. A little slither of this worth a fucking mansion in your mud hole. We're not thieves. You don't want your money? Fucking more for the rest of us. There'll be a threshold. Keep it under mil. [computer beeps] Ah, fucking hell! - [thud] - You bastard. Well we can't take him to fucking hospital now, can we? [Simon groaning] Phones. Everyone, put your phones in the bucket. Put your phones in the fucking bucket now. No backstabbing, no backroom deals. We're all in this together. Phones in the bucket now. We finish this the way we started. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Together. [liquid splashing] [crow cawing] [Simon groaning] I did basic training once, Captain, when I was a kid. Just out of my teens. Judge thought it might straighten me out. It was that or jail. We might have ended up in the same regiment, fancy that. It didn't though, straighten me out. Turns out I've got a low tolerance for being treated like shit - by people like you. - Just get on with it then. [grunts] Take it. [ominous music] ♪♪ Dig! Use the fucking barrow for Christ's sake, I can't dig. We do this together! Dig! Dig! [Simon screaming] [Simon laughing] [Simon screaming] [Simon choking] Jim's on the run. He's already killed a guard in a robbery. And I knew. Makes you wonder what he had planned if we'd got out money, don't it? [car arriving] [car door closes] Simon, darling, are you ready? We're gonna be late. Simon? [car leaving] Simon? Simon? Shh! Calm down! Calm down! It's me, it's me. It's Viktor. Calm down. Calm down, please. Listen, I'm going to remove my hand, but you have to promise to be silent. Look, bad things have happened here. We have to run away immediately. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Where's Simon? He's... Stop! We must escape now! Where's Simon? Where is he, please? [exhales] Alright, you see, it's like this. I don't know how much he shared with you about his er, financial situation... Financial situation? Not much. Okay, because maybe you knew he was having some problems. It seems the good captain was all fur coat and no knickers. If you'll pardon the expression. Obviously, we wish we'd known sooner but... it seems that his financial situation has come to a head and he has done a bunk. He's done a bunk? A bunk, yeah. Stuck two fingers up to the tax man and the bank and off he has fucked. Happens more often than you think, but it has left us significantly out of pocket. I'm sorry to hear that. Well I'm sorry to break it to you like this. Maybe, maybe he thought he could do the place up, sell it on, make a quick profit. Bail himself out? Bob? Explains the tight deadline. There you go. Thank you. Well that's terrible. Terrible, I mean, after all the work you've done for him. Yeah, you can imagine how we feel. Hmm. And you have no idea where he's gone? No. Do you? No, I have no idea. - There's a joint account. - A joint account? Yep. We have one together, we're engaged. I could go in to Cardiff tomorrow morning and draw the money out. As Simon's left you in the lurch after all the work you've done, it only seems fair. How much is in the joint account? Not much, 15, 16 grand. Something like that. Probably a fraction of what you're owed but you know, if it would help? I'm sorry I have to break the news about your fiancé like this. You know, I'd been starting to have second thoughts anyway. Guess this seals it. I guess. I'm sorry. Given that the captain has already run out on us, I'm sure you will understand that we are a bit wary of lightning striking twice. So, you'll be staying here tonight. - But all my things are in the house. - I know. But, it's not up for discussion. But Viktor, you'll be coming with us. Where you off to then, lover boy? Riding off into the sunset? I just wanted her to be safe. I didn't have any plan. Bless! Is she your girlfriend then, is she? [grunting] - In you get! - No! In you fucking go. Guys, it's not funny, it stinks! Let me out. Let me out! Guys! Let me out! Please! - [laughing] - Please! - [makes fart noise] - Guys! Bob? Bob? Bob? Bob, I know you're out there. Bob, I know you can hear me. Bob, I really, I really need you to open this door now, okay? You are just a builder though, right? I know you got roped into this. You... you've got a family, Bob. We talked about them, remember? I can see them up on this wall, they... they look really lovely. Your wife, your daughter. Imagine if it was her in here. Huh? [crying] Bob, I really need you to let me out, okay? [whisky pouring] [sighs] Right. The money and the bag... That puts us close to what each man's owed. It's fill your boots and split time, Dave. Well that split as well, what do you want to do? Four ways or five? Four. Fuck him. No, he grafted, he earned his cash. Fuck him! He worked twice as hard as you. He gets his cut. And we need to get this place cleaned up. Steve... Before we go to Cardiff in the morning... Everything. Clean. What about the girl? I think we both know what has to happen there, Dave. No, no, no, no, no, no. No way. She's already seen the blood. She's already hatching plans. If she gets to the police, we're fucked. Yeah, well who? Who's gonna do that? We play for it. [door opens] Dave. [door closes] Whoa, whoa, what, what? What are you doing? Stop! Fuck. [banging] [laughing] [coughing] [sniffles] You crying? [laughs] You Wendy. What's wrong with ya? Do you know how many favors I had to call in to keep you out of prison when you cut that kid up? I want you to show me some respect. [laughs] What, like my dad shows you some fucking respect? He thinks you're a mug, Uncle Bob. He's so right! Look at ya. Look at ya! Do you know he used to deny that you two were related at school? [laughs] Yeah, do you know what he called ya? He calls ya The Provider. Yeah, need to borrow the van, get some money in, hey? Get a big round in for the boys. Who you gonna call? The Provider. He and my mum always used to laugh about that. What happened to you, Steve? Where'd you go? That little kid I used to take to the footie, hey? Jesus fuck. Jesus Christ. You're soft as a bit of shit, Bob! I grew up! I grew up, Uncle Bob. I don't wanna come watch your shitty football team getting dragged about like an idiot. Come on. Jim said scrub the place up now. Come on. Hey, Bob, don't forget your apron! You're a disappointment, Steve. What you been doing? What do you want? Just wanna come have a little chat. [grunting, fighting] Where you going, huh? Huh? [grunts] [thud] [nail gun pops] [groans in pain] He attacked her. [grunts] [screaming in pain] Help, Bob! [grunting, struggling] Shoot him, Uncle Bob! [screaming] He's gonna kill us both, you know it! Jim! Jim! Jim! Jim! [grunting, struggling] Jim! [thud] [nail gun pops] [panting] Come on. Where have you been? Eh? That's all I'm asking you Where have you been? None of your fucking business. I've been looking everywhere for you. Don't go fucking disappearing again, Dave. I'm 72, I can look after myself. Let me handle this. What happened? Where is she? Bob? He attacked her. I know he's hardly the biggest loss to man kind's gene pool, but Bob, for fuck's sake, you skewered your own nephew! No. Not me. The Russian? You check the woods, take his car, bigger beams. Bob, wake up for fuck's sake, he's dead! Okay? Check the fields. I'll check the perimeter. Then we'll take the van. Beams and horns if we find him, okay? If we don't have him in 2 hours, we meet back here. We divvy up, we split. Okay? Agreed? How do we know that you are not going to fuck off with that bag? Dave, fucking... If they get to a phone, we're all fucked. This isn't a fucking game, Dave! Move! [screaming] [flare hissing] [ominous music] ♪♪ [Viktor grunts] Okay. [winces in pain] I didn't need saving. I couldn't leave you. Here, open it. I save some, I send some. I just want a better life for us. That's Sofiya, my daughter. She's smart like you. You would like her. You never loved Simon? So who are you? What do you want? I'm the same as you. What happened to Simon? Please, tell me. He treated them, us, like shit. Shake a bottle long enough, it explodes. Viktor, is he dead? Where is he? It doesn't matter. He is dead. Where is he? Tell me! Under the concrete. The cesspit. [car approaching] Keep him talking. [car door opens, closes] I see she dropped the dead weight. You been saving your pennies? Just as well seeing how this played out. Hello. Come on, in the bag. No. Give me the money. I can kill you and take it, or I can just take it. It's your call. It's for my daughter. She won't miss it. Trust me, best she learns that you can't rely on family. Then she can stand on her own two feet. You were never gonna get it to her anyway, Viktor. Look at you. You're fucked! [cries out in pain] [grunting] [Viktor cries] [panting] Police please. My name is Bob Pearson. [pensive music] ♪♪ [birds chirping] [cellphone ringing] [water sloshing] [grunts in effort] Sorry about this, old boy! I can't feel my legs. You're losing too much blood. I'm sorry for Simon. I know. But you've fucked it all up. Ugh. Jesus! Let's keep it professional. Well we're on Plan B. We've got finger prints, passport, bank manager's never met him. Yeah, great. Eighteen months reeling him in. Bloody cavemen! - He saved me. - He looks fucked. You know, Simon thought you had a thing for him. Petty cash! Jesus! [grunting in pain] Go and get the bag. Did you think about it when he popped the question? Marrying into it? Coffee mornings, bringing up little captains? So the finger arrives by medical courier 45 minutes after we do. Let's hope Plan B works or we're screwed. Petty cash and a few quid in the bag for 18 months playing the mark... I'll get this to her, I promise. A life away from all this. Amy? Amy?
