WILLOW Holy Mother of God, may angels forever sit at your shoulder. You are a mother too. Have mercy. Grant me the boon of feeling life move in my belly. Let me feel a child at my breast, hear his heart beat inside me. Mary Mother of God. Let him smile. Let him grow. And let me grow old and wrinkled, watching him. You are a mother too. God bless, mother. Little cunt bakes cheese on willow roots. Little prick comes in his boots. Little cunt picks a little spade. She hits little prick on his head. Little prick - off he goes very sad. Did you make the rakiya? No, my sister. For health. Strong. Sweet. May Veles look after you. Mother, we have a sorrow. I know, sweetheart. No one comes to me for good things. They don't invite me to their weddings to dance. We'll invite you, be grateful forever. We've been thirsting for five years now. Our souls are withered for a little baby. To cry in our home, for us to drink in his laughter, raise him while we grow old. - Five years? - Five. You putting it in the right place? You sticking it in the wrong hole, aren't you? Do you stick it in better? No harm in asking. You don't look like one of those. Mother, we tried everything: I rolled dirt on me while it thunders, I'd eat three pieces of hail when the first hail falls. I tried a nettle broom and fresh milk. I drank water, salt and basil... and steam over boiling dry cow manure. Give us a cure, we'll praise you till our last breath. May God give you with an open hand as grace begets grace. I'll help you, child. Only if this one here obeys. He doesn't look too sharp to me. You can't have children because you've been cursed. Cursed? By mother. She's cursed you. Mother's curse doesn't fall on the ground. You will do as I tell you. And we'll do away with your curse. I'll tell you how... ... and your seed will catch. You'll have a whole gaggle of children. Right? But... There's one thing. Anything you say, mother. God bless, grandma. You must give me your firstborn. I need someone to take care of me, to bury me before the flies feast on me. Don't want a bear's turd for a tombstone. You're asking a lot. Only the firstborn. You'll have a whole flock of children. Allright, mother. So be it. May God multiply our offspring. Bow low, o, willow. Just as the river runs fast, may our child catch on fast. Bless us, o, willow, so our children last. Your face away from the moon. I can't. I saw the baby we'll have. Your health, my liege-lord. May God cheer you always. Now rest, so the food thinks a king ate it. Bless your handiwork. Mother? Come in, you're soaked through. You don't kiss a hand over a threshold. Dear Lord, you'll get a cold. What are you doing out in a storm like this? Sit down. It's been raining all day. I'll warm up milk from our goat, then I'll get you supper. It grew up. May God bless you. May your name be remembered, you brought us such happiness... It wasn't born on Saturday, was it? No, mother. On Wednesday. - What did you name it? - We have not been to church yet. - That's all right... - We call him Kuzman. After my grandfather. Life and health to you. May you be served hand and foot. I brought him new clothes, granny's precious. Quiet baby, you should have named him Mirko. Mother, let me get you something to eat. I'll prepare your mat, you must be tired. The harvest was good. God bless you. Enjoy. I will be going now. Now? In the middle of the night? It's raining. Mother, I'll prepare your mat. Easier in daylight tomorrow. I came to take Mirko. No! You will give your firstborn to me. That's what we said. He was destined for me. Mother, I am begging you! I'm old, someone needs to take care of me. I'll take care of you as if you were my own mother. I'll serve you the rest of my life. Take my soul, just don't take Kuzman. You'd be taking our sun from us. You'll have a gaggle of children, don't you worry. Your house will be full of children. Granny's unchristened little thing. Mother, no! Sweetest, dearest mother... Don't take our Kuzman, that'll be the end of us. Please! Sweetest, dearest mother, don't take our Kuzman. Mother, no! My Liege-Lord! What have we done! May I give birth to a stone, damn me! We sinned, may I give birth to a stone! May I drink water from a spike! Go after God and the Virgin, not after Satan and the she-devil. May this willow weep for you. May this river carry our sins away. Father will make me a flute out of a willow branch. He'll teach me to play, and you'll sing with us. He'll make you a flute, son. Today he's working for uncle Brajko in the village. He lent us his oxen to plow. Now we're going to uncle Uka, the miller. We'll give him barley, he'll give us wheat, mill it for us. We must hurry before night falls. If you want, son... Son? Where are you, Kuzman? Look what I found, willow for a flute. Father will carve it. Father will carve it, he will. I've told you a hundred times to stay away from the river! May you whirl under a willow! It hurts. Oh, it will hurt alright, when I tell your father. If I behave, will father still make me a flute? The wolves slaughtered our lambs. Wolves don't care if the lambs pray to your god or to ours. I'm embarrassed, don't know what to do for the feast. If the wolves have not attacked near you yet, let us buy a kid or two. Ask him to come. I will tell him, then you men talk. Kuzman, son, let's go. Wolves killed Prodan's donkey. The winter was hard. They came into the village. Kuzman, I'll rip your ears off. Come out, or I'll spank you. Damn it! Try the sidewalk? I can't, sir. I told you. I'll miss my plane. I'll lose my license. Hell, no, I'm fucking stuck in a cab. No, bro, I don't know if I'll make it. No, he doesn't give a fuck. You go on. Save me a bit of that thing that starts with a "p". We'll take a shortcut. - Fuck! - God! Say something, sir! Are you alive? Thank God! Your head, sir... Here's a stone. Don't move, sir! I'm calling an ambulance. - What happened? - I don't know. You fucking fucks, watch where you driving! Uncle Risto, is that you? Uncle Stavre. The Bonehead. Yes, uncle Stavre, the Bonehead, Denicija's grandfather. Dafina's. Yeah, Dafina's. The Bonehead. Let's move him inside. No, something might be broken. An ambulance's on its way. Not in the middle of the world cup finals. - Let's take him to the hospital. - No, please. - Did anyone call the police? - Who the hell are you? Branko, taxi driver. I hit him. Do you have eyes, Ray Charles? Fucking county - all they care is buildings. They'll sell their mother's ass for a buck. Every year someone gets killed here. Oh, dear mother of God... - Uncle Risto, you ok? - Stavre. Yeah, uncle Stavre. The Bonehead? Yes, the Bonehead. Sis, pass me the lighter. What's he doing? Waiting for the police. Heaven help us. Did you turn off the taximeter? Do you know how to love? Rodna, get back here! Don't make me yell twice! My mother, she worries about me. My sister too. I'm coming! And buy me cigarettes! Take this. This one still waiting? Yup. Can someone lend him some brains? Mom, some people are honest. Hello, police? Have you no shame? Just tell me that. Half an hour ago we reported an accident near the Palm Beach shopping mall. You don't give a damn, watch the finals, let this dumb taxi driver wait for you. I am Vesna's and Milutin's daughter, from the fifth floor. The car mechanic, the neighbor from the fifth floor. He just retired. My sister Katerina is on the third floor. With her husband Nikola. - The mechanic, right? - Right. The taxi driver who hit you... ... has he come? - To see you? - To see me? To ask how you are. No. Hasn't come. He took care of you. He was really worried. He waited until the cops came. Half an hour. In the rain. He wouldn't go until they came to file their report, even though everybody left. Do you want a banana? Stavre, is that you? And who are you? Mancho. From Suvo Grlo. What family? Efrem's. Who went to Argentina. I heard a car hit you, so I came to see you. They say you were on your deathbed. Well, I'm not. Even got a new girlfriend. Came to ask you something. Ask. I'll go wash the bananas. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Who are you looking for? Stavre Dunivetroski. Gave me four children, all handsome as hell, ten grandchildren, three great-grandchildren. I got her a very nice tombstone. There's room for me too. Wrote my name on it, left room for the year of death. Picked a picture, and just as we finished, I heard a car hit you, you're on your deathbed. I knew God was giving me a sign. I better find you before He takes you. Don't you worry, I'm tough. Stavre, may God help me, did you ever have anything with Mrs. Mancho? Say what? Did you have anything with her? With who? With Mrs. Mancho. My wife, may God rest her soul. Did I have anything with your wife? May God rest her soul. In the village everybody says you and she did it. Many times. If she was with you, I'll make a new tomb for myself. I don't want to be buried with her if you and Mrs. Mancho had anything. Good afternoon. I came to see how you are. The nurse told me, thank God... ...you have nothing broken. Nothing, thank God. Nothing broken. But my shoulder hurts a lot. Sit down, please... I'll go wash the bananas. C'mon! What are you looking at? You too. What are you looking at? Is this apple for uncle Stavre? I brought your book. And your stone. I'll pay it, sweetie. Went to the power company yesterday, but didn't have enough money. I'll pay it. We haven't been paid. I have time after work. - You're not coming home? - I have another guerrilla gig. Subbing for Consuela. Her grandfather died. - Do you have money? - We'll be getting Chinese tips. Chinese kiss? Tips, dummy. Tips. I have to go. I have to go. Sweetie... Take care. 115. Return the oil. 75. I have only 70. I'll pay you tomorrow. Please. Dude, have you seen Che Guevara? He owes me 100 Euro. No, leave it, I'll remove it at home. I feel like I'm making out with Freddie Mercury. Damn it. You can't even light a candle. What are we going to do when they cut off our electricity? Cut it out or I'll return you to your mother, ask for my goats back. Happy birthday, sunshine. You kidding? It's not today. Happy 29th birthday, 4 months and 17 days. And three years since we met in the rain. Honey bear... Come in! Branko Kuzmanovski? Sweetie! Please wait. Are you ok? Do you want to go home? Let's go eat something, it's on me. Kalin, they are out of it! Kalin, there is no hazelnut ice cream! I'll buy you almond instead! Stop it or I'll spank you! Why didn't your dad buy you some when you were there? There's no hazelnut ice cream! Why don't you stop screaming, you bitch? Get out! Don't come back! I'll call the police. Crazy bitch! Let's go, sweetie. Wait! This little willow tree? Whatever you got. May it grow. It's going to rain. The flies are biting. They poke around inside you for smear... ...for mandatory tests, then you carry them to a lab. Wait in line with a hundred patients. And there goes your sick day! Kire, sweetheart. Don't move! Your aunt... Your aunt Rodna is not feeling well. I'll be right back. Sis? Thank God you came. I'm fed up with her. Come. Enough now, come here. Enough? I had enough. I've had it with hormonal stimulants, miscarriages, negative results, pitiful looks, sneering, hope for next time. I have a Caesarian, but I have never given birth. I have no more uterus, sis. Nothing's left after all the cutting. I'm taking it out, sis. I'm fed up. I've had it with not having... ...with being poor. Should I rub dirt on myself when it thunders? Eat three pieces of hail 'cause I am bare! Barren! Go see a fortune teller? Auntie already found someone. You know it, you've done it all yourself. At least you have Kire. You have no idea... Kire... What are you doing? Kire, say something, please. Stop it! Stop it! Branko, the apple... - I can't. - Try. - I don't know. - Try! Bulldozer... I don't know... a wardrobe. Happy birthday, honey bear. It's not my... Bunny... The doctor says they are doing fine. They? Twins, honey bear. Twins. Please don't get upset - I took out a loan. And borrowed some money too. Move it to the right. Twins. Careful, it's sticky. We are not going to dress them the same. We'll get a loan, fix another room. No one's giving us another loan. I'll find a way. Twins. There goes the twin. Come. Look. I love it when the sun's shining. The bagel good? Yes. Was it fresh? Not really. Did you get the notice? I don't know. You did. Your wife signed for it. I'll pay you back, I swear. I swear on my unborn children. I'm working double shifts, I'll borrow from my father-in-law. I'll pay you back, interest and all. I never took a loan before. It turned out they are twins, God bless them. We tried in vitro, we failed. The insurance paid. Then you have to pay out of your own pocket. No way around it. Stimulation shots, checkups, surgeries... It took us five years for her to get pregnant. We're eating bread and water, just to keep my babies healthy. Give me two weeks, please. Until my brother sells his tobacco crop. Have mercy. On Monday you get a collection notice. I am a debt collector, not the Red Cross. I tried that. I was a math teacher. This pays better. Rodna... Let me draw you a picture. One baby will be abnormal. What is there not to understand? Abnormal, handicapped, retarded, it won't be able to take care of itself. It will die, die early. It will make the other baby's life miserable. But the cribs...? I was so happy... This is what God wanted. We'll give it love. Sunshine... We'll give our love to the other one. We'll love it. We'll save it from the misery... ... of growing up with such... ... such a sad view, sad brother or sister. Rodna, what's wrong with you? There is a procedure, bunny. Surgery. One fetus... It's a fetus, Branko, fetus! One fetus is eliminated, one stays. "Eliminated"? Branko, it will never be aware of itself. No one knows how retarded it will be. A plant. It will ruin the other child's life. No! We'll love it. There is another way. Rodna... Don't you "Rodna" me, Branko! God did not want that. We can't... What we can't - is ruin the other child's life. I won't allow you, Rodna. In case you've forgotten, let me remind you: My! Womb! I have a part too. You do. It is a God's child too. It's a sin. What about our other child? Is it not a sin to hurt it? This is only a fetus. Cells. I'll swallow my soul whole. Honey bear, I found peppers. Expensive, but I wanted to make you roasted peppers. Hurry up. Don't you remember? My sister's name day. Sorry, honey. Your phone's off all day. I'll be quick. Rodna... Did you go see the doctor? Fucking hell, Branko... I tried to give a chance to the other one. They are both gone. They are both gone, Branko. Kill me, Branko... Sector 3, is anyone available? Car 139? Car 139, are you there? Are you there? Branko, are you ok? Hello. Hello. Do you remember when I asked you, "Do you know how to love?" I really wanted to know. Uncle, give me some money. Give us 10 denars. Rosoman, we arrived. - Do you have anything smaller? - Don't you? I just started my shift, sir. Next time you should. Bunny... ...you left your sock. You can't wear the other one alone. You can't wear only one sock. You can't... Kire is one of the nicest children here. He's a good boy. Isn't that so, Kire? We're shy with people we don't know. He is emotional and sensitive, as I told you. He knows us. Right, Kire? That's right, of course. Kire? C'mon, don't be shy. Say hello to our guests. Do you remember who they are? You met them last week. And the week before. Kire, dear... These are your new mom and dad. Hello, sweetie. Don't you remember us? This is for you, buddy. Fire truck! What a beautiful fire truck Kire's mom and dad bought him! What do you say to them now? Mom and dad brought you new clothes. He is very excited. Squeeze hard. Like a man. Sweet dreams, sweet baby. Sleep well, son. Let's buy a bicycle tomorrow? Don't exaggerate. He's just a kid. Not just a kid at all. Mom, don't smoke in the car. Do you want me to do a yoga pose? At least not when we're with Kire. You think he's gonna start smoking? Granny's little fatball. He makes honey. Diligent little bee he is, not a crooked cricket. He doesn't say a word, you never shut up. You're both driving me nuts. At least I'm not retarded. Kire! Don't disappear on me, son. You scared me witless. Kalin! Come on! We'll surprise your aunt Rodna at the cash register. She doesn't know we're coming. Kalin! Stop it or I'll spank you! Why didn't your dad buy you some when you were there? How many times do I need to repeat? Why don't you stop, you bitch? Get out of here. Don't come back! I'll call the police! You're scaring my child! She could cut him some slack. They are like children. Svetle went to see a fortune teller for you. She says someone put a spell on you. They put a curse on a stone, hid it under your marriage bed. You need to find it and crush it. It's not under the bed. It could only be in my kidney. When is your next procedure? - Not going. - Not going? Sis? - Barren it is, babe. - Don't change the subject. You gonna give up? After four years of trying? A man-woman. - Fucks, but does not breed. - Stop it. I'm serious. Me too. That ship has sailed for me, babe. I also thought it wasn't going to work for me. Now I carry twins. Keep trying. I can't deal with it now. I have a child. A child with a problem. But you want your own child. Sorry. I know people are talking. "They finally adopted, and look how it turned out." Fuck 'em. "Why raise other people's blood, you'll never love it like your own," "God knows what kind of genes it will carry, could be a murderer or a Gypsy..." I'm scared, sis. I love my little Buddha to pieces. But Nikola might be right - the kid is strange. Maybe he's really autistic. I don't know if I'm strong enough to raise him. The doctor says it doesn't matter that Kire doesn't talk. He's the most intelligent patient he's ever seen. Says Nobel Prize for chemistry or for economy. - Didn't mention literature? - No. "Little Buddha". Must be Nobel for Peace. Little Buddha... ...says nothing. He's afraid of water. I feel he's very smart, but I don't know if he's happy. I know nothing about him. So what if he doesn't talk? Do you want someone who never shuts up? "Mom, what is cunnilingus?" Good point. He should keep his mouth shut. - Gi' me a puff. - Get lost! Obituary - Stavre Dunivetroski (The Bonehead) It's not green, but it's still a frog. It's tired. Look at these two! The Gypsy and the adopted. Careful, don't kill it. If you kill it, your mother will die. She may not be your real mother, but she loves you very much. Kire... What are you doing? You are not sleeping? You are driving a car? Do you want us to drive for real? You will drive. Go now. Is this good? Do it on your own? Ok? Drive now. When we came to the orphanage, you were the sweetest and smartest kid. That's why we picked you. You became our son and I became your mom. You are my beautiful little boy. You are my little sweetheart. You are my little Buddha. Mother's little chatterbox. - At least now you know he's not autistic. - So what, even if he is. You don't love a child because he is smart or gorgeous. You love him because he is a child. - His eyes lit up when he was driving. - You're crazy too. The boy opened up. He's gonna be Formula 1, or a taxi driver. Didn't I ban that word? Sweet little thing. He saw that someone trusts him. The kid woke up, sis. I saw him waking up. - How's your Simon? - Growing. He'll be a King Kong. - Is his father big, Hans-Lukas? - He's tiny. Is he coming for the delivery? I don't want to pressure him. You'll have to introduce him to mom and dad. And tell them what? "Mom, dad, this is Hans-Lukas. He had a conference in Skopje and his condom broke"? You don't have to be technical. He says he was deployed to Burkina Feso. - Faso. - Huh? - Faso. - Faso? Burkina Faso, you dummy. Children are a mystery. What am I saying - people are a mystery. As long as he's healthy. Yeah... As long as he's happy. - Give me a puff. - Get lost, you're pregnant. Kire, sweetie, it's time. Where are you, son? This is no time for games. Sis... Sis, what is it? He must be playing. You go check with mom upstairs. Kire! - Have you seen Kire? - Who? What is it, Miss? Where are you? - What a brave boy! - Yes, such a beautiful circumcision. Kire! You'll be okay. Mom, why are you crying?
