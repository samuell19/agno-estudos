NELL: 'I don't even know why you make me work with this stuff anyway.' 'What do you mean?' 'Because it's horse hair.' 'It's good stuff.' 'No.' There's some little Indian girl walking around India lookin' for her hair. Mm-mm. She my friend. And what you really need to learn to do is to get back to your roots. Go natural. I am natural. Except for, I have other natural hair. No, you bought this. I know. And it was on a hanger when you bought it. But it lived once. It didn't live on your... And if it, if it lived, it's real. Alright, I'mma give this now. Okay. Make sure you get it right on the part. I will. No. Because if you get it on the hair then it's gonna be hard to take out. And then I have to cut my real hair. It is not like I haven't done this before. You haven't. But it's not like I can't figure out how it's done. Tonight's really important. I know, I know. Because you have a date. Yeah. You finally gonna get some, you know. You haven't had sex since you were little, so... And it's Saturday night, and I always gotta spend my Saturday nights with you. Well, maybe I'll kill myself after I leave and that'll be my exciting change of pace. Let's see what my mom's talking about. SHIRLEY: [on phone] 'You know, my friends ask me, "Why can't Gabby keep a man?"' 'And then I say, "Well, she just hasn't found the right one."' 'On the back of my mind, I know' 'it's that curse.' Okay, alright, I can finish it. Yeah? Yeah. Thank you for doing the back. You're welcome. Oh, my gosh, you have fun, okay? Thank you. Have fun, and get some. Yes. Have fun and get some. Have fun and get some. ♪ Have fun get some ♪ Have fun get some ♪ Have fun get some ♪ Have fun and get.. I think there's something on fire out here. GABRIELLE: 'Thank you, girl.' Oh, my God! [gasps] [grunting] [fire alarm beeping] [cell phone ringing] Hello? 'Hey, you.' Hey, handsome. Are you ready for tonight? 'Not quite.' Ha ha. I know that's right. 'Cause you ain't ready for this, if you know what I mean. 'I can't make it.' What? You do know what I mean, right? Whoa! 'My girlfriend's sick. We got back to... ' Wait, wait. Girlfriend? 'We got back together a few days ago.' 'And since you and I only went out on a couple of dates' 'I figured, you know, maybe we could still... ' Unh-unh. Don't say it. Don't say you just wanna be friends. 'Cause I hate friends. 'Thanks for letting me off the hook.' No, you're not off the hook. It's Saturday night. You're not off the hook. Listen, okay. This is what we're gonna do. You'll just quit her. And I can pretend like this conversation never happened. We'll survive this. 'Um..' You're on the hook! [phone hangs] SHIRLEY: [on phone] 'It's the curse.' We asked 100 single women, "After how many dates do you start to wear sweats?" You said... four. 'Survey said..' [applause] Well, how many? 'Ten dates.' 'Ten dates was the number one answer. Mm-hmm.' It's 8:45, and already 76 degrees here in Los Angeles. 'It's shaping up to be a real scorcher today.' 'So make sure to get in that car, keep your A/C on.' Hmm? 'And keep chill during..' Oh, my God! [hip-hop song] [engine sputtering] 'Wait!' [grunting] Excuse me, excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. [groaning] [song continues] [gasps] Oh! Oh! DANTE: Hey, Gab, hold the door. [grunting] I'm sorry 'bout that. Phew! Appreciate that. I like what you do with your hair. Looks nice. You, you got a little piece hangin' little, um, if you don't mind. 'Push it right there..' What are you.. Oh, damn! Damn! Damn, I swear to God, I didn't mean to do that. That was not... Not the.. You know what? That's, uh, it's fine. 'Cause you wouldn't understand. I'm doing my hair at home from now on because it's too expensive going to the salon and human hair alone costs a lot of money. It's like a carno. That is not human hair. At all, and I do understand. Come on, you've got a self-conscious belief that the right guy may never show up. So, why waste your money on a salon, right? Soon the same theory gonna apply to your monthly wax. And you're not wearing matching underwear. Damn that. A man innately able to sense when a woman is hiding a bear in her non-matching underwear. He stops checking for your self-conscious belief becomes a self-filling prophecy. And just so you know, I do wear matching underwear. Look, I'm not judging you. Hey! Hey! Thank you. [both moaning] Mm. Thanks for bringing this. Any chance to see my beautiful wife. You hanging out with your friend later? Yeah. 'Still wanna hit the strip club after?' Definitely. Alright, madam beauty editor. You get back to work. Okay. Alright, I'mma get outta here. I'll see you later. Okay. Love you. Ten shades that say down for whatever. MARGOT: 'So, some of your biggest hits, uh, "Fat Punami"' "Number One Poom-Poom Killer" and "Me Love The Strippers" all refer to women as just some of their parts. Now, in a pantheon of words one could string together to create such a lyric. Why not use something a little less degrading to women? Whoa. Well, you know I believe women should be empowered to do what they want to with their bodies. But how embarrassing it must be for you that I am the feminist here. I sense this underlying condescension in your tone. Which tells me that this is a story that you were assigned. Not one that you chose. You see, if you listen to my music you'll see that it's so important to me to put some joy in a folk's Friday night. And for the police to stop using black people for target practice. But since some lyrics, they captivated you you must be some Freudian draw. No ring on that finger. So you're definitely not married. [chuckles] Girl, you haven't even cracked a smile since I sat down. So the joy of sex is completely missing from your life, huh? [laughing] How long it been now? About a year? Ten months since the last time you made love to somebody? Let's round it up, and call it two years. I can't do this. Women. Yes, I'm right, ain't I, darling? I can't do it! Yeah, vamanos. Someone else can do this interview. [instrumental music] [clears throat] Change that font back to standard. Oh, I was, I was trying something different. I actually created this. Mm, we pay you to make things fit on a page. Not create the Mona Lisa. Is that the royal "We?" Excuse me? No, it was, it was a joke. Because, you said "We" like you were one of the owners of the magazine. So I was like.. Yeah! You're about to find out about the royal unemployment line. Keep telling those corny ass jokes.. Did you read Maureen's column this morning? Don't you have a job to do, as well? Not until Maureen get's here. And then to do my job well for the editor-in-chief I need to be in a good mood or else blame someone for why I messed up. And you know how much Maureen loves mistakes. Moated. So, Maureen's column.. Mm-hmm. Killed me. Mm? Like I am dead. I need life support, oxygen.. [elevator bell dings] [instrumental music] [hip-hop song] ♪ Ayo that's all we know ♪ You only live once better turn it turn it up ♪ ♪ It's show time that's all we know ♪ ♪ Ayo ayo wayoh ♪ Ayo that's how we roll ♪ You only get one shot better get our there and get it ♪ ♪ It's show time that's all we know ♪ ♪ Ayo ♪ Shh.. So, what happened with Big Stunna? He was asking questions that were very personal. He wanted to know the last time you got laid. Yes. 'So, when was the last time you got laid?' It's personal. Uff. That long. These are not questions you should ask in a workplace. Well, they were asked in this workplace this morning by our featured artist. And since you didn't answer, he's gone. 'Find a way to make him sit down with you' 'and complete the interview.' Or you're fired. My personal life is... None of my business. No, I know. Either you want to keep your job.. I just bought a house. Or not. [instrumental music] You're not gonna lose your job. I mean, you probably.. She was gonna lose her job. She probably lost her job. 'But, it's okay.' 'I mean, let's not nag.' More importantly, are there any single men here? Oh, yes. What's up, ladies? Hello. Yo. Unh-unh, uh-uh. That seat's taken. Ah, your purse don't need a seat. Don't touch my stuff. Ah, come on. It's fake skin. Okay. Three three-olive martinis. Yes! Here you go. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. And a sparkling water. GABRIELLE: 'What's that about?' I'm going to the strip club later with Kevin. So, uh, I'm gonna drink there. Wait, wait. You go to the strip club with your husband? Ha-ha-ha. They got a situation. [laughing] BILLIE: 'Will you please stop calling it that?' 'We do not have a situation.' I happen to have a wonderfully fulfilling open-marriage with a great guy. But why? BILLIE: 'Didn't you hear the part where I said' ' "Wonderfully fulfilling?"' And "Great guy?" DANTE: 'Hey, don't be judgmental.' Love isn't one-size-fits-all, right? You want a license to cheat? If you're honest, it ain't cheating, alright? And although I do respect the choice open-marriage ain't for me. Mm-hmm. But it's just so... But it is better than no sex at all. And, and, you know what? What is that about? Like, is that an AKA thing? Delta, and celibacy is a personal choice. But is it? Oh, shit. It's solipsistic to think that just because something isn't your choice, that it's a bad choice. 'I can be in love with one man' and open to a connection with another. MARGOT: 'But it's a dangerous game.' Sooner or later, somebody crosses the line. But, I'm too concerned about this Big Stunna thing to be worried about my love life. I helped build this site, and I'm about to lose it all because of some self-described Punani Killer? Can we please talk about my problems? Oh, do we have that kind of time? Why is he allowed to sit with us? Because it's not high school. Okay, so every time I like a guy we get in three or four dates and then, he's gone. I'm a pretty self-confident person but I'm starting to wonder. Is something wrong with me? When the right guy shows up... He'll probably vanish after three dates just like all the wrong guys. I just wanna know in a real and concrete way how can I make it last? Oh! Oh, my God. 'What?' Didn't you read Maureen's column? No. Yuck. Oh, okay. "Women make a mistake when they think of the first few dates "as an audition. "And if they perform well "a man will cast them in the role of girlfriend "and with any future luck, wife. "For men, a relationship isn't real until the tenth date '"when they've made enough of an investment' '"that continuing the relationship' "is a conscious decision. "Instead of getting emotionally attached "the first time she feels butterflies "a woman will be well served "remembering that a man at this stage 'is either infatuated... "' Or he just trying to hit it. Boom! "And, she should gather information "and put on an emotional condom "until the tenth date. '"Ironically, it is this living in the moment' 'that will get her... "' To ten. And voila. But I've never been on ten dates with the same person and I've been in love plenty of times. Has everyone here gotten to a tenth date before with the same person? 'Uh..' Yes. Ahem. Mm, yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, baby, yeah. You have ten every ten minutes, okay? [chatter] I'm gonna do it. Me too. What are we doing? The tenth date. Wait, wait, wait. It's not something you do. No, it is. Getting to ten with the same person. You know, don't worry about getting married don't get too attached, just have a good enough time to go out again, and then, it's date number two. And then date number three. And then you're in a relationship. Why is that so important? Because, I want love. Sometimes, Maureen just pulls things out of her ass to stay on deadline. Can you be positive for once, please? But if you are going to do this she'll probably pay you to write about it for the magazine. 'Yeah!' How much? Freelancers get $300 a story. 'Yup!' I could get my weave done! Yes! 'Oh, God, man!' Can I remind you, you don't have a working car? Yes, but that is my engine. And engines are way more than $300. You know what? For front row seats to this foolishness I would, uh, drive you to work every morning. MARGOT: 'And I'll help you pitch it to Maureen.' Okay. We all support you. And we'll be like the people that don't actually run the marathon but, like, give the little cups of water to those that do. Mm. I'll take it. To ten. Yes, to ten. To ten. Woo-hoo. Yeah! To ten, to ten, to ten! [hip-hop song] Hey! I just gotta drop this young lady off, first. Might as well hit the back, right? 'You good?' MARGOT: It's fun, it has real emotional stakes. Because if she can't get to ten it means there's probably something really wrong with her. No. It's boring. Are we gonna see her trying and trying, and never getting there? 'It would be a great story.' And the goal is to get there. Yes, but there are no guarantees, Mon Cheri. But, if she can get to ten dates in the next sixty days with the same man then that's a story. And for that we'll pay $5000. Oh! Shut the front door. It's a cliche, but people love a cliche. Here, she needs to fix her hair to even stand a chance. Oh. Sorry. Sorry, sorry. Thank you, thank you. Okay, go. Not a hope in hell. 'So good.' You know what? We also have half off on bikini wax. Oh, no. No, no, I'm good. Mm, you haven't been maintaining up here. I'm sure you haven't been maintaining down there. Let's get that started? Yeah, let's do that right now. Absolutely. [upbeat song] No. That's a no. He is gorgeous. I'm telling you. Even for an experiment. No, no, no! No, no, pass. Pass! I don't like him. He got a big ol' smile. Like a horse, a little bit? Yeah. I'm gonna give him a chance. Go ahead, I like him. I'll give him a chance! Don't do that! No! So, uh, what about the money? Oh, if I can get to ten, in two months I write about it, and then I get $5000. What? Yeah. Okay. I think that you should date someone super desperate. Yeah. And do the real tenth date after you get the money. Okay, no, no. First of all, karma. And second, I'm not doing this for the money. Oh, well, I'm sorry, what is that? Nothing. Hmm. "Past due." Oh, oh, oh. They're about to turn off your electricity? See, I think you should think a little bit more about this money. And maybe work on your art, too. Tu-Tu-Tu-too! From your friends in art department. 'Oh, my gosh!' To ten! My name is Gabrielle Fateful. 'A local artist.' 'Seeking representation.' [sighs] [electricity crackling] 'Damn.' No, no, no. Take it now, and then make the phone call. She needs it, Dante. [overlapping chatter] My girl! You took it too far. Girl, just call Big Stunna. You got this. You got this. Okay. You got it. Okay. 'Should be fun.' Voicemail. Good. Hi, Margot Scotts calling. I guess you're busy. Um, call me when you can. I'll be here. Perfect. 'I hate my life.' Oh, come on. 'That was good!' Don't hate your life, you're just doing what you have to do to save your job, which most of the time you love, right? Unh-unh, since when does doing my job mean telling a complete stranger about my vagina's dry spell. 'Oh!' 'We're gonna work on that.' Did you remember hanging that up? [gasping] Oh. Ow. Damn. Oh! So, um, guess what? We're gonna go to the club on Friday nights. Us ladies should go, find out what's in these streets. Have some fun! You guys can't come. I'd rather record that voicemail again.

Two women servicing me? Yeah, I like the thought. Well, what if I want two men servicing me? Then you would need to find a husband that's okay with that [bleep] [scoffs] [sighs] Okay. You know we could always just do this the old-fashioned way. Just me, and you. Let's go to bed, baby. [hip-hop song] How are we supposed to compete with that? I mean, we could start stripping. Yeah, but then we'd have to work out. [snickering] 12 o'clock. Light skinned. White shirt, black polka dots. 'You see him?' 'Yes.' [laughing] Cutie. He cute! Oh, wait. Uh, oh, ooh! 'He trying to be sexy with.. Ooh!' Mm-hmm. You saw that? Uh-huh. That's sick. GABRIELLE: 'Wait a minute, look at that tongue action!' Oh, he's getting nasty! 'Oh!' 'Mm-hmm. That's mine.'

Scooped him early, bitches. Snatch game! You win. [laughing] Yeah, you're like, for real. I just, I kind of always imagined that I would end up with a good man.. ...till I saw you. [chuckles] Let me ask you a question. Yeah, you can ask me a question. Um, well, I know that I have a powerful some may even say masculine vibe but you do know that I'm a woman? Right? Fine as hell, woman. But, you just said that... I'm not. I'm not gay. I'm bisexual. I mean, yeah, I like men, I'm attracted to men when I meet the right one. But.. I mean, I like women.

Kevin wasn't down for the menage when he learned the third party was a dude. You didn't discuss it first? I said Enzo's name. That sound's like a guy, right? Mm. It's kind of a gray area. Guess I'll have to schedule some alone time with Enzo. Okay, don't get mad at me 'cause I'm not being Margot, alright? I just.. I don't get it either. If you love Kevin, then why do you need to have sex with this other guy? I don't need to do anything. I like Enzo. And sometimes that goes to a place where the expression is sexual. So, no rules? Oh, there are definitely rules like, knowing the other person knows. Seems kind of arbitrary. I love Kevin, because with him I can be in a marriage and still... breathe. You think marriage is suffocating? Not with Kevin. Wow. Most women feel like marriage is the prize. You feel like it is something that has to be negotiated so it doesn't kill you.

But not with the same guy? Which is the point. Are you gonna be an asshole your whole life? So, wait, wait, wait. You never had a boyfriend? No, I had... a Chris. A Chris? Yeah. He played football, and he was really smart. He volunteered and [bleep] How am I not supposed to fall in love with a guy like that right away? And he went a little overboard. What does that mean? There was a restraining order. Look, I wish I could see him again, you know? Hmm, sounds fun. So, what can't you settle down? No, I'm not ready yet. Mm-mm. I ain't ready. Uh-huh? Um, I mean, there is someone I care about. Mm-hmm. I mean, she's, she's magic. Oh! But, uh, I'm not ready to be with just her. And she too dope to play games with. You better hope she doesn't meet someone in the meantime. Well, I hope she finds happiness in the meantime. And me when the time is right. How can you know she's the one, and then not be ready? You know what? There is a logical explanation for that. Scientific actually. In simplest terms.. ...it's because I have a penis. [chuckles] But you love her? We could be like Martin and Gina. My God!

I'm gonna ask you a very important question. Do you accept Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and savior? Yes. I can't hear you. Yes! And then you are saved! [whispering] What do I do? [speaking foreign language] [laughing] Yes, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. 'Oh! Oh!' 'Oh, Lord!' Oh, blesses me. [crowd murmuring] [screams] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Yes! [instrumental music] [cell phone beeping] Oh, my God! MAN: [on tv] 'Looking for a special gift for someone in your life?' [knock on door] 'Hang on here, 'cause Lisa's got some great ideas for you. Lisa?' LISA: [on tv] 'You don't wanna miss this..' DANTE: 'Gabby, I saw you turn the TV off.' You know I can see you, right? You're hidin' under the covers. 'I have Chinese food.' The whole world saw my vagina. Okay, I mean, silver lining, silver lining. Turns out that you were current on your monthly wax. My vagina is viral. The whole world's gonna see it. [whispers] My mom's gonna see it. And I didn't even like him like that. He probably likes you a lot now. I accepted Christ for him. Hey, at least you got one friend. Oh, I can't do this anymore. Can't do what? This whole tenth date thing. Maybe I'm just not cut out for love. Maybe I'm not the type of person who is.. Oh, come on, come on. ...gonna get love, right? You're good. Gab, Gab, don't.. No, you.. Hey, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry. No-no-no-no. [sobbing] My vagina was on the internet. Hey, you're okay. You're good. Good! Thanks. [sniffling] [instrumental music] Um.. Yes. I'mma go. Is that cool? Yeah. Yeah. Okay then. Alright. Alright then, I'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Okay. And I want you to get me a bagel but don't Maureen see me eating carbs, okay? Oh! What's new, pussycat? I have to tell you something. Yeah? So, Dante came over last night, and he kissed me. He could tell from the internet, your vagina is magical. [chuckles] No, it's not like that. Well, what was it like, huh? It was really good. It got really good. And then, he left. Oh, see, Gab honey, you're a bad kisser. It's gonna be... No! I don't know why he left. Well, you want me to ask him? No. It's just a question. I'll be right back. No-no-no-no. Oh, wait a minute. Maureen, she want's you to hire someone in graphics. Another you. Why? And why not get HR? And please don't talk to Dante. Alright, I won't, listen. They're opening a Chicago version of Nina so, it's gonna be twice as much work. And she doesn't want HR to do it because they won't ask the creative questions. But if they're launching something new they don't need a new assistant, they need a new vision. Well, right now, all she wants is a new art assistant. Hey, but I don't know how to interview people. Alright, make up some work sounding stuff. And then, just pick the guy that we all can sleep with before he says we sexually harassed him. Hop to it. [instrumental music] Okay. Oh, so stupid. Oh, great, great. [sighs] Thank you. "Chris Kellerman?" Hi, um, are you here for a job? Nah, I'm here for you. I, I lost your number, and I remembered you worked here so thought I'd stop by. I guess your receptionist put my name on the wrong list. [laughing] Oh, bad Bets. And now, I'm about to be late to my next appointment. So, but how about we do dinner? Yeah, yeah, um... That cool? Let's just do the little, you know, little thing. There we go, see you. Alright. Got it? Got it. So, I'll call you tonight. Okay, alright. Oh, um, did you mean for a dinner tonight or you gonna call me tonight for dinner later? I just wanted to know just because I, um.. You know, I'm really busy doing a lot of very successful things. No, I-I get it. Yeah. Which do you prefer? Um.. How about lunch tomorrow? Alright. So, I'll call you tonight to confirm lunch for tomorrow. Right, right, yeah. [giggles] If he's interviewing for this job you need to make him have sex with you. GABRIELLE: 'Uh, I think he could hear you still.' Yeah. No, I'm not scared, playboy. She gonna trap you in the elevator. Rawr! Gotcha! Get him. Today was crazy. It was crazy. What happened? You guys'll never believe what happened. So, I'm doing these interviews and Chris, Chris-Chris came to the office. Wait.. 'Old Chris?' Y'all know Chris. Pretty Chris. Oh, okay. And he asked me on a date. How long has it been? Like.. I don't know. It's like.. I was young and beautiful and innocent. Wasn't that just last year? And Chris was playing for The Raiders and.. You know, I thought we were gonna get married and I'd be like on one of those rich house-wife shows. You know? Mm-hmm. But then, he got traded and then he quit me and then he had this whole restraining order thing. And I just, I don't understand why he's back. I think he just wants a kidney. What are you gonna do? I mean, you only need one, right? I mean, about Chris. 'Yeah.' And about Dante, because, like, three hours ago you were saying that was the most magical kiss of your life. I.. That is not what I said. Dante? Y'all kissed? 'Oh, y'all don't know?' Hmm. It just happened. Anyway... Wait a minute. How has Dante been since the kiss? He came in early, so I haven't seen him yet. So, I asked him to give me a ride home so that I could talk to him. What are you gonna say? [instrumental music] [engine revving] So, um, something happened today. Yeah, yeah, I... Wait, you remember that guy that I told you that I-I really like, and I totally destroyed all of his stuff and he got restraining order against me? I don't remember you telling me you destroyed all his stuff. Uh, might wanna remember that, that was crazy. [both laugh] Yeah, um, well, he came back, the guy Chris. Like what? In the last 24 hours? Yeah. So, like.. I was thinking that I would give the tenth date a second shot. Oh! Oh! I mean, 'cause you don't wanna get serious. And-and, he's.. Well, he's the kinda guy who gets serious. And you don't want to get to the tenth date... It's cool. It's good for you, good for you. Good for y'all, you know? Okay. Well, you want me to go back to ridin' the metro in the morning? No, I don't. But it might be best. You bought out the whole restaurant for an interview? Well, it's more private this way. You have something you wanna ask me? Oh, you don't have any questions about my personal life first? Yeah, but you have a deadline. I think we'll have more time for questions in the future. Okay. Nah, I'm only 35, but my knees are 40. So, I just wanted to retire while I still have some respect. Then I figured, I'll hit you up, you know? See if we could still be friends. Yeah. So, um, is, uh, friendship.. ...the only reason that you wanted to see me? So, I'm about to open a lounge. And I didn't want it to be one of those corny cliche, former NFL spots with no class and no style. And I remembered you used do those dope paintings. So, here's what I'm proposin'. How about I commission you to do some work for the lounge? And you could even do, like, a special event where you could sell your artwork. That's great. Yeah. And that's all you wanted? That's all. [chuckles] And this isn't a date? It's an appointment. And you don't wanna date me? You, you have somethin' on your face. 'It..' What? It says, "Emotional condom." "Just get to ten." [chuckles] I have to go to the bathroom. [instrumental music] I don't wanna talk about it. Okay. Whatever he did, it is no reflection on you. Yes it is! [bleep] Okay, just.. Alright, calm down. DELIVERY GUY: Gabrielle Fateful? Yes? Here you go. Here we go, gotta sign that. Hey, ain't you the girl from that internet video? No! This better not be another subpoena trick. It's from Chris. Huh! It's from Chris. Oh, my God! I think he loves you. Um, ahem. "Not sure what I did, but I'm sorry." Oh, he's sorry. He's sorry. There's an apology. "With love, the chance to make up for it." He wants to make up for it. Um, go ahead and put my girl back up on the board over there. "Would still very much like to be.. ...friends." [music continues] Wants to be friends. Well, that's okay. [grunting] 'Okay.' I already have a friend who's name is Nell. I don't need another one. Gab? [whispering] You have a problem. Oh, my God! That's okay. [telephone ringing] Can I help you? Yeah. I see you got the flowers I sent. I'm sorry I didn't meant upset you. I've had a really difficult week. My vagina was on the internet. Hmm. Yeah, I saw that. Is there somewhere we can go talk? Yeah. Okay. Alright. Thank you. Alright. You looking good in those jeans. Okay. Well, uh, somebody should clean this up. [clears throat] So, the reason is... I lost my sister a few months ago. She passed away. I didn't realize how nice it was to have a woman to just sit down and talk to until she was gone. I'm sorry. So, I figured, this time around, if we took things slow and actually work to build a friendship.. ...maybe we could have a different outcome. So, I apologize. I guess I should have been more direct. So, I could have finished my lunch. It was good, too. Well, how about I make it up to you this Saturday? I'll buy you lunch. Only if it's a date. Oh, it's a date. Yeah. So, I'll see you later? Yeah.

Um, so, I heard that they're starting a Chicago version of Nina magazine and I was hoping that you would, um, put in a good word for me with the creative director. Are you serious? [laughs] Look, I know what happened between us was like kind of weird but, um, you know, putting that aside... Because that's just so easy. This could really mean something to me. If you could just send my portfolio to her.. I am him. Okay? I'm the new creative director for the Chicago site. Oh. But how can you do that from here? Oh. So you're moving to Chicago? Um. Okay. I, well, I'll just leave this here. Oh, that's not necessary. I know what you're capable of. [instrumental music] I don't think we should see each other any more. What? Come on, girl, stop playing. No, I'm not playing. Bitch, from whence does this come? Because no straight guy talks like that. And because the guy at the bar was right. And I don't want to be waitin' around for the day that you realize that you're gay and then I'm just some interesting experiment and they were on Yarla. And then she's all like, "Beloved somewhere inside you knew he wanted a penis." Okay, stop, right now, alright. Stop. I don't want a penis. I have a penis. I want you. And I told you, babe, I'm not gay. I'm bisexual. It's the same thing. No. It is really not. And I've been dealing with that same kind of ignorant close-minded [bleep] my entire life. And I'm not about to start taking it from the person I love. You love me? [sighs] Correction. From the person I loved. [dramatic music] He loves you. And-and maybe we should let go of what we think that's supposed to look like. Yeah, but, Gab, I mean.. I don't know if I can do this, you know. I mean.. This is really different. Like when we are walking on the street, I don't know if he's looking at girls or if he's looking at guys. He's not looking at the girls. Oh, you're gonna have to help me with this because I really care about him, but I don't know if I can wrap my brain around it. Look, here's the thing. He loves you. He's not with anyone else. So, he's not bisexual. He's Nellsexual. He's Nellsexual? He's Nellsexual. [laughs] 'Cause I'm Nell. 'Cause you're Nell. And you're sexual. Yeah, I'm very sexual. Very sexual. Guess you're right. Okay, I'm okay. Enough of me. Go, get ready. For your date. Wait, wait, wait. So which one should I wear? Storm or Alicia? Oh, the-the bob cause that's innocent and that's ratchet at the same time. Mm-hmm. Oh, my God. I'm finally going to get to ten. 'And to think like after all those assholes.' The guy that I'm supposed to be with is the guy that I already knew. Uh-huh, but maybe not the one you think. Dante is moving to Chicago, and he has like a million girls and he never said that he wants to be with me. Okay. So, you're just gonna go with the safe choice, huh? Sorry, I'm just gonna be here in judgment. Well, I think, that I've been very mature in having made a choice at all. I'm gonna get to ten! And I'm really happy. [instrumental music] Rise up, mother. I'm sorry for coming inside 'to your new home without your permission.' This is so romantic. Yeah? Yes. I've made you a prayer rug. You know, how black twitters always come in for Netflix and chill. Like, I like it. I like Netflix and I like chilling. How could either of those be bad? Is there anything you want to talk about? Just having a really good time. Oh. 'Cause I really want to watch this movie. Oh! Oh. I'm good. You sure? Hmm. Okay. It's just, there's only one more date left. For what? Uh.. It's just this thing that we have at work. It doesn't.. No, no, no. What's, what's this thing at work? And why are you talking about our dates? No, it's not a big deal. It's.. Let's just.. Come on. Let's just watch the movie. No, no, no, I want to know more about this thing you have at work. Uh. Okay. Well, my boss has this theory that a man doesn't know that he's in a relationship until the tenth date. And I realized that I've never been on a tenth date so they made me this board at work to see if I can get to ten, and now I'm at nine tonight, so. 'That's all.' Oh. It's funny, right? [laughs] Yeah. Yeah. 'Cause you don't seem like you think it's that funny. Uh, I just think it's a bit strange. I mean, but as long as you don't think this tenth date thing is a big deal I guess it's cool. WOMAN: [on tv] 'The guest will be arriving soon.' It is a big deal. I bought a wig for this. See. Now, it's-it's going to fall. No, no, no. It's fine. It's fine. It's.. You're right. Let's just, let's just finish watching the movie. It's just, I want it mean something when we get to ten, because it means something to me. Why are you standing? We need to talk. No, there's nothing to talk about. Nothing. Come on, let's just... No. No, no, no. Sit. Come on, let's, we can finish the movie. I'm gonna go grab a drink. [instrumental music] So this tenth date thing. It seems like it means a lot to you. Yes. I'm sorry. But it, it doesn't to me. Gabie, when I contacted you, I just wanted to see if there was still something left between us. And we both know there is. But I don't think it's enough to try to force us into a full-blown commitment. Why are you making commitment sound like a communicable disease? Because I'm just not ready for it. I wanted to see if we could... I just thought my Netflix and chill was the problem. Maybe we should spend some time apart. If you wanted time apart then why did you come back? When I retired from NFL life just seemed like it was moving in slow motion. And then I remembered you, and how exciting you were. I mean, you were a little crazy but that's what I love about you. I never knew if the night was gonna end with us fighting or... So you came back because I'll be the right amount of excitement to get you over the hump of adjusting to life outside of NFL. Gabie, I didn't say that. No! You said you wanted to be friends first. You said, one step at a time. I mean, of course that means that we're working towards the future in my head. I was trying to protect you. Well then you should've locked yourself in a cage like a werewolf at full moon. I didn't want you to get too attached. Have you met me? I get too attached. Okay. Just, just, calm down, Gabie. Oh! Calm down? Calm down? Oh, I'm so calm. 'Is this calm enough for you?' Calm, calm, calm. Ooh, I'm so calm. Look at me calm down. Are you done now? Okay, I'm sorry, if I hurt you. Okay? If? If! There is no if! And you're just standing there, all cool and collected. Like you're biggest problem is how are you gonna clean all this [bleep] up after I leave. It hurts. It hurts like a [bleep] [instrumental music] I'm just gonna take this. [telephone ringing] [music continues] [phone ringing] FREDDY: 'Hey, you've reached Freddy.' 'If you leave an interesting enough message' 'maybe I'll call you back.' We agreed.. ...the one thing we wouldn't do is sleep with someone the other one knew. I only agreed to an open marriage so I could be with you. It killed me that you could be with other people and I just wanted you. Did you sleep with Bets to hurt me? I don't know. Maybe. Why can't we just try it like this? Just you and me. It's not who I am. So, what do we do now? I guess just sit here. Let our hearts break. I'm sorry. [instrumental music] Well in addition to getting dumped I received three rejection letters so, probably have a nervous breakdown. BILLIE: 'Oh! Rejections from art galleries.' MARGOT: 'Girl, you just got to keep tryin'.' GABRIELLE: I can't even get to ten. It is not climbing Mount Everest. It's gettin' a guy to say that I would hang out with her ten times. And I always thought that I was cute enough or funny enough.. Or something enough that I, I'd be with someone by now. But I guess I'm not. You are. And you know it. Look, the truth is no one knows why love pick some people and not others. I mean, you could be celibate. You could go on ten dates. You could.. Have an open marriage. But... until love picks you you might as well sit back and enjoy the ride because nothing you do is gonna make a bit of difference. 'And the whole emotional condom thing, my God' is not so that you don't fall so fast. Is so that you don't move so fast that you forget how amazing you are while you're on the ride. In the meantime, think. And send out more letters as a [bleep] To the ones that came back now. I've just been launching pebbles at the castle for so long, I'm just tired.

I don't know what happened. Who is responsible for this? Maureen! Uh, Ms. Laurant. L.A. Art Museum just tweeted about the new look. I did not approve the new look. Our investors and advertisers weren't told about the new look. So there is no new look. But, no, no. They, they think the new art work is phenomenal. Shut it down. Um.. You did this. Yep. I mean, yes. You're fired. You have no power. You're fired. Oh, uh, ten galleries in the last two minutes have just tweeted about the new look. How did you know, they'd spread this? I, um, I didn't. I just.. I took a chance on their taste, and yours. So fired. Am I? I like your haircut. I, I'll need a raise. I'll be working longer hours. How much? Five thousand dollars a month.

Gab, Billie, this is my friend. Her man. Please, don't ask. Alright, now. BILLIE: 'Okay.' I'll be right back. Nice to meet you. Hey, excuse us. Hey. Hey. Hey. Um.. So you're the reason my show sold out. Your work is beautiful. Thank you. It was a smart investment. Okay. Um, listen, I know that I [bleep] up. You're my friend. And not just my friend like, "Oh, I should be with my lame ass friend because we were like friends forever." But, like, you're my hot friend. You're my Martin, and I didn't realize that not getting to ten with you is better than getting to ten with anyone else. Thanks. Uh. Hey. Isn't this amazing? Yes. Oh, my God. I'm just so happy and thank you for lending your house. Of course. This is so beautiful. He's so beautiful. I'm so happy for you. Now, would you kill me if I left? Oh, no. No, honey.

I love Chicago. But she's magic. But you left. Why, you gonna make it easy. What you're gonna leave me for some other dude or somebody like "Hi, it is cool." Nah! But I should've been honest with you, alright? I should've told you how I felt. And you're my Gina. And I'm ready. Wait. Do we have to restart the whole calendar? For what? We already been on ten dates. What? Okay, maybe nine. How many times did we go and work late have breakfast, have dinner? But those weren't dates. Those were dates to me. And okay, wait. Like, do you have a pen? For what? I'm gonna give you a kiss... I need a pen. I need a pen. Okay, let's go. Please. What you doing? Thank you. What you doing?
