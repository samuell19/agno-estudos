Hey, aunt Tue is coming. Yeah, aunt Tue! Aunt Tue! Please take us home. It's a bit full. Mind your seat. OK. -Let's go, aunt Tue! -Let's go. OK. Welcome to the Magical Dance show, the most popular talent show in Vietnam. Please give a round of applause for our judges, John Huy Tran, actress Van Trang, and poet Phong Viet. Why did you choose to join this show? My son really loves it. I believe he can do it. He needs to practice more. It's not that simple. Tim, repeat after me: blue. Blue. Tue. What are you saying, Tim? Don't laugh at him. He can say it. One more time, sweetheart: blue. Blue. Tue. Red! Red! Tue. Blue! Blue! Tue. Red! Red! Tue. Faster, aunt Tue! Faster! Alright, we're here. Thank you, aunt Tue! Thanks, aunt Tue! Good kids. Hey Tim, are you going to the market with us? You go first. Tim will stay here to help me. OK. Thank you, aunt Tue! Good boy! Wait for Mommy here. I'll be right back after delivering those boxes, okay? Tue! Excellent! Just a minute. Welcome to the Magical Dance show. As long as you have passion, we will help you to shine. Delivery, guys. Fresh morning glory. You will... Tim! Tim! Tim! Is Tim here, Tam? I have no idea. Where did he go? My gosh! Let me know if he comes here. Sure! Tim! Your favorite show is back, Chin! Ladies and gentlemen, the performance received two votes from two judges, Van Trang and John Huy Tran. Judge Phong Viet is still not satisfied with it. Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim! Tim! Where did you go? You bad boy. Stop beating him, take him home to get changed. How is he? -He's fine. -He's fine. I need your clothes for him. OK. Holy moly! Here, drink it when it's hot. Help him. Are you okay? Did you swallow water? Scared the hell out of me. Get three bowls of rice to the place that he fell and worship. You should. OK. You look handsome in this shirt. Are you wearing pants? Of course! My God! Giang's son is handsome. Like father, like son. -Isn't he? -Giang. Where were you? How could you come just in time? I'll be wherever Tue is. No wonder why Tue doesn't care about you. You should have let him stay here with us. I know. I told you. If you're busy, just leave him here. I'll take care of him. Yeah right, last time his hands were nearly cut off by the ice blender. You should let him go to school. It'll be so much easier for you, and him, too. He's going to school soon, Tam. -Really? -But he'll be one year behind. Sounds good. It's okay that you are one year behind. I were even three years behind but still, I became a successful man. Stop talking bullshit. Gosh, I heard you became a hero, saving the pretty woman's son this morning. While pretty... Giang, let me help you. Piece of a cake. Hey, you have more than enough ice. Why did you order more? It's my business. I can order as much as I want. Are you selling? You have that much free time? Ordering one ice pack every 30 minutes. Ridiculous. I want to. Where are you going? Hey, wait, are you tired? Have some energy drink, then go to bed and sleep. Are you insane? Energy drink then go to bed? For what? Well, have some energy drink then go to bed. It makes you feel better. 25,000 dong for five packs. Bring two more this afternoon then I'll pay. Okay. Hang on, Giang. Mai... Stop it! Stop matching our name! Sounds so irritating! Giang Mai (syphilis). Why irritating? Actually, it is... but Giang... Giang! Did it hurt when I beat you? I'm sorry. I was so scared. Tim. Tue. Yeah... Mom Tue. Mommy. Tue. Mommy. Tue. Just a second. Hello. You have my sympathy. He should be in second grade. Letting him study in first grade is quite confusing. I'm not sure whether he can. He can, of course. He knows a lot of things. He can focus, not like last year. Stay focused and get your books, please. He is focusing. He likes spinning stuff. I'm afraid he only focuses on what he likes. -It'll be hard. -No. He'll just look at it for a while then he'll be back to studying. I hope so. You can go now. The class has started. -Thank you a lot, teacher. -No problem. Please repeat after me. Yeah. -"A". -"A". -"B". -"B". -"C". -"C". -"A". -"A". -"B". -"B". -"C". -"C". Tue. What's wrong with you? Why do you suddenly stop me? Money. -What money? -School tuition for Tim. Listen, it's for Tim. Mom Tue doesn't have to work today. Mind your own business. Take it. I don't want people to think that I'm taking advantage of you. Who dares to take advantage of me? I only do what I want. No one can force me. I'll kill them if I have to. Take it, Tue. I know that you care about us. But I can take care of it. Tue, wait... Okay... you borrow it from me. Pay me back when you can. I don't need it. Leave me the alone! I mean don't worry about us. Tue! Tue! Hey, Tue. Are you going to take all the jobs from us? Delivering fish and stuff, then making salt. Make some time to find a father for Tim. She doesn't have to. Don't you see Giang running around her? Tim is going to school. I need more work to do. Is he able to go to school? Yes, he is. He's a normal boy. He's crazy. How can he go to school? What did you just say? I said he was crazy. Enough. Hey! Say anything you want about me, -but don't you dare mention my son. -Let it go! -I'm saying the truth. -Why is he crazy? He can't even say "Mom". Idiot. Don't. Come on, let me through. Tue. Tue! Tim is in trouble. Tim is in trouble. Mrs. Tue. I'm so sorry about this, but you know that Tim is not as normal as the other kids. He can't study here. I hope you understand. Based on the result, Tim has symptoms of autism. What is autism? Is this disease curable? Please keep calm. Autism is not a disease. It's a kind of disorder of behaviors and languages. Children will face difficulties with social interaction and communication. Chidren with autism like Tim will face a lot of challenges in life. Even with the simplest behaviors. To teach children with autism, we need to have scientific methods, a special learning program. That's why the tuition is quite high. You're a special kid. No matter what happens, I will never give up. Never! -Tim, red. -Tue. Tue! Tue. What's wrong? Are you okay? Use some oil. -For your hands, too. -Stop it! Uncle, I need to give her something. Alright, I'm fine. Sis Tue, have some sugar tea. What are you doing? Let me do it. Keep it. Who asked you? Have some sugar tea, Tue. -Drink it. -Let me do it. Have some medicine, big sis. Why... you guys? Have some medicine. I don't need it. I'm not sick. It's tonic, not for sickness. Well, I need to deliver something. No. Let me take you home. Hey kids, help her. Yeah, right. Let's do it. Come on! I can do it. Are you crazy? Later come to uncle Tam's, look after Tim for me. Don’t worry about it. You can take him to your house. Oh, gosh! No, no way. Listen, Tim. If you put your fingers into the fan, your finger will be cut off. What on earth? He asked me to turn on the fan. Come on. -Stop! -Do what he wants. It's so hot. Get him off. Why are you holding him? It's too hot. He shouts because it's too hot. See? It's cooler. He's happy now. See that? -Well... My gosh! -You see? Who's messing with my boy? What's up, Tam? -He wants to turn on the fan. -Stop! Don't cry, honey. Gosh, do it for him. It's damn hot outside, what's the point of saving some electricity? -But he... -What? If you want to save some money, I'll pay the bill for you. Oh, you want to play? This is to turn it off. He wants to play with the fan. This is to turn it on. Great job! Follow your daddy... We've tried our best, we can only offer 30% discount for Tim. Hope you understand. Tue… Giang… Tue… Are you insane? You want me to die? I didn't mean it. I heard it was a severe accident, the car seemed to have crashed up on the sidewalk. Scared the hell out of me! Ask Tim how I felt. Tim, tell your mom. Tue! Saying that does me no good. Well, I'm going to take some medicine then we'll go home. Wait... ask the doctor to check the difficult... sickness. It's fine, the doctor will call me when he has the result. Okay, let me drive you two home. Let's celebrate, right? You don’t have to say anything, I understand. How could you think it's possible? Why not? Giang needs to have his own family. But Giang doesn't like Mai. He likes big sis. Hey, who says Giang doesn't like me? Actually he's good at hiding it. That's why I need you guys to make a scene that pushes him to tell the truth. Stop saying bullshit, Mai. Gosh! I told you. Even our names can never match together, so as us. But… There's no "but". To get rid of your desire, I decided. I will marry Tue. Let's get married, get married Let's get married Our youth will pass by In the blink of an eye Let me love you forever Let's get married, get married What's the point of dating, If we don't get married? Let's get married, get married What do you think? Tell me Or let's go to the ward And have our marriage license For how long have we been in love? I can't wait any longer I'm worried every day What if you're bored of me? And fond of the other guys I would rather die How can I live? I decide that we're going to get married Let's do it soon Delay it, we may have kids first Enough? I'm not kidding. Tue. Let's live together. You're sure you don't mind what people say about you raising a child not yours? You're sure that you love Tim, and you can take care of him for the rest of your life? -You can't answer, right? -I... Then forget all the bullshit that you did. -It's not like that, Tue... -Go away! Tue. Tue. She was my teacher. She loves her students with all her heart. I told her about Tim. I retired long time ago. I just missed my students, so I gathered all the poor kids in this fishing village, so they can learn how to read. I hope that… you will let Tim join. I don't have much experience on children with autism. But I think the best way is to give them love, especially with this special kids. Sure. Thank you so much. Don't mention it. These are some documents about children with autism. Please keep them as references. That's good. Thank you. Two times one is two. Two times two is four. Two times three is six. Two times four is eight. Two times five is ten. Hello, teacher. Hello, how are you? Say hello to her. Come to me. Let's go Tim. It's fine, he'll get used to it. Hopefully… Come here. Let's make some friends here, Tim. Here, everyone, we have a new friend today. He's Tim. He's very kind, just a little shy. So you all need to take care of him and help him, okay? -Yes. -Good. This is Bear. Hi Tim, I'm Bear. -Very good. -This is Fish. Hi Tim, I'm Fish. And this is Cat. Hello, I'm Cat. This is our prettiest girl, her name is Cuc Hoa. Hi Tim. Just say it so I can eat.

If you don't, I'm afraid… Tim. This is our picture. Is it beautiful? Tue. You have to keep it with you always. I'll always be with you. Why did you choose this show? I… Please keep going. I don't want my boy to win or anything. I just hope he… my son… can have some experience, he can face some challenges and... be more confident. We need more time to practice. It's not as simple as you think. I know, but my son really likes this show. I believe he can do it. Sinh. -Sinh. -Okay. We can't choose them. Why not? The purpose of this show is to find talents... -not a show-- -Quan... you should remember... I do the show not to promote anyone. I need something unique, right from this round. They are unique. But how can we let them in? That's your job. I don't need to know. Quan, don't you find this story touching? And the audience really likes this kind of things. I don't think they can make it. There's no arguing about it. The more tears and attention you can get from the audience, the better. -But how can I-- -Again! We need to go to the top with this story.

Good boy, you can do it. Tim, be a good boy. Please take this. Consider it as I want to support you. As long as you leave the show. This is a talent show, not a charity show. Don't you see that you are wasting our time? Sorry. Let's go. Mrs. Tue. Take it. You're wrong. I don't need money now. I just need my son to be more confident. You will never understand. Thank you. -Tue. -Mrs. Tue! How long has your sister been taking this medicine for? It's for patients with cancer. Mrs. Tue! Hi. Thank you for taking me here in time. Let me pay you back. No need.

Will you come? Hey... Present for me? If you have time, let Tim know your phone number, and uncle Tam's number. So he can call you guys in case he's in trouble. Your number is in red.

Please stay tuned to know who will get into next round. Ladies and gentlemen, passion always bring us inspiring stories. Next week, we will share with you a very touching story about a mother's love. But first, let's watch a short clip about them. Look! That's Tue! That's my son! My son! He looks more clever on TV. I asked his mother to join this show. Hey, let's listen to Tue. All women, all mothers love their children. I just have one fear... that one day, I won't have the chance to hold my son's hands, to protect him anymore. I joined this show so that we can have beautiful memories. Ladies and gentlemen, someone said that the love of a mother is the most peaceful and magical love that exists. The story of our two special contestants, Tim and his mother, proves it all. And one more thing, Tue wants to keep it for herself, but we need to share this for her. When this clip is airing, Tue is fighting with stage four cancer. What we hope by sharing this story is your compassion for her to help lengthen her life, give her some more time with her son. Tue, the roof is still okay. Why are you changing it? The rainy season is coming. Just do it, don't ask. Okay. -When you're free... -Uhm...? Show Tim how to call your phone number and uncle Tam's number. So he can call you guys in case he's in trouble. Tue, how about your number? No need. I'm aways with him. Gosh! This is my treasure. I've been forgetful lately. Poor them. I told you not to share my illness to anyone. Please listen, Mrs. Tue... I don't need empathy. Are you okay? Tue! Tue. I... I know what you want to say. Don't waste your empathy... No. I really love you. Tim needs a father. Don't be cruel to yourself. Don't be cruel to me. I may die soon. I don't care. I just want to take care of you and Tim, even just for one day. I want to be with you, I want to look after you. And I really need to... I want to love you. I don't want to die. I can't leave my son. It's okay. Why me? I don't want to die. Mrs. Tue, I'm... sorry. To be honest, with the reaction of the audience lately, I think it's good for Tim. We really expect the audience will be with you two until the end. -Tim follow me. -Five six seven go. One, two, three and four. -Tue. -Tim, Tim. Tim, follow me. -Tue. -Tim. Tim. Tue.
