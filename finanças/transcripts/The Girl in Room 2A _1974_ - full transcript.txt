Take care of yourself ... - You are very thin. - I'm going. - Resolution on the way out? - Here you go. You can go. Poor girl. - What's she going to do now? - She will not soon forget it. Maybe it it will serve as a lesson. Well ... Hell, no! We run ... Wait ... Wait ...! One moment! I do not mean to scare you. It's all wind. It's okay. Good afternoon. - Where's the phone? - In the far corner. Thank you. Hello? Hello? Signorina Sundberg? It's Margaret ... Margaret Brady. Yeah, all right. I was going to Signora Grant ... No, do not have time for the bus. Yes, I will sit for the next. After half an hour. Of course. I'll call Signora Grant I will say that you left her. Your things are already taken. - Margaret? - Excuse me ... - Your stuff there. - Thank you. I do not know how to thank you for all you have done for me. It's just my job. I'll call you as soon as I can. Will there be anything need, just tell me. Thank you, Signor Grant. Wonderful room. I hope you will feel at home here, Margaret. And do not worry. Everybody makes mistakes. You got it wrong. I've done nothing wrong. Social worker, Signorina Sundberg, said you were just out of prison. But you do not have this shame, really. No, I did not put in jail. It was a temporary conclusion. Then they realized they were wrong. I'm sorry, I did not think upset you. I would like to get some rest. Of course. Do what you want. Talk to you later. I just went down for their belongings. Good holiday. He's not hurt. Looking for something, Margaret? I want to take a walk. I can not sleep. You must be very worried. I'll pour you a hot tea. Poor thing, look, how are you excited. Looks like it. I am very nervous. Well, who would not be nervous, to experience something? You're lucky, I just boiled water for tea. - Make yourself at home, Margaret. - Thank you. My son and I live here alone since my husband died. He was an excellent pianist. Do you play? No ... As a child, I took lessons, but already forgotten it. Is located. Please ... That's tea, Margaret. - I hope you like a lemon. - Of course. You do not want to drink a little sedation with tea? - Sedative? - Yes. A pair of tablets relaxes you. They are very good. I myself accept them. The doctor prescribed me them from insomnia. Calms the nerves. Try one. Okay ... Maybe they can help me sleep. I need it. Sometimes it happens so lonely. This is a picture of my husband. My son is very similar to it. Poor John, already twenty years since he was here. I'm sorry. It is true. He was shot down at night, when he returned home. He died on the spot. Accident? Oh, no, it was not accident. It was a cold-blooded murder. He was killed by robbers who tried away with murder. They got 20 years in prison. He died, and the people who killed him, will soon be released. If the trial was fair, they, too, would be dead. What are you talking about? Revenge is contrary principles of humanity. Humanity? What kind of humanity ... ... Who does not even know how to punish the killers? Forgive them means justify them. No. I heard pulled machine. Maybe it's them. All right. And then it's too late. Are you trying to contact. My mother called, but you did not answer. I was not home. - Where have you been? - What? They say you have a girlfriend. Mistress. They say she's cheating on her husband. Is that true? Of course not. Hope you do not believe. Oh, I do not know. Signor Dries says ... What does the lord Dries? Dries ... Good to see you. Are you sure? Of course, happy as ever. The new philosophy of your group captivated me. It is not new, Johnson. It is as old as the world. The old story struggle between good and evil is reduced to its basic concepts. That's what I meant. There are several points that we need to discuss I was able to detail all justified in his article. I do not need you to explain. And do not think you all of us will write. We are not interested in your article. - What are you talking about? I. .. - Enough of these tricks. You just want to use us in their own interest. A series of articles about us become would be a great sensation, right? Posushayte, Dries, you're wrong. This is a misunderstanding, I swear! You have to be punished Johnson. Wat ... Elemental War of good evil, recall? Wait a minute, Dries. I think you understand, Johnson. Excellent all understand. Only through the pain ... can we be cleansed of our sin, as it says in the Bible. You're mad, Dries! Are you insane. Come on, Frank, let's leave Signor Johnson with his thoughts. No! No, wait, Dries. I'll give you a lot of money. As much as you want. Just call amount. We assume that the donation to your group. Posushayte, Dries ... Dirty bastard. No! ... Dries ...! Very good. You can return to the city, Frank. - I do not need? - No, not now. I'll come to you soon. Signor Dries ...? What is it, Frank? - It's about your mother? - No ... No, signora about Johnson. I think he was ... our other. One of us. This is to be seen. Do not worry, we will not hurt, Only a little parrot. We already have enough worries. Yes, I know ... - My mother always says ... - Your mother was a beautiful woman. And now, go. I'll come to you later. - Today? - Yes, of course. Only in fire is the truth. (Nietzsche) Welcome. It's hot. Yes. You are right. Very hot. Maybe we should pay fireplace, yes, sir Johnson? - Fireplace? - Yes, there's too hot. Too hot. Extinguish the fire. Let go of me! Grille is too hot. I burned my hand, let me go! Let go! Are you out of your mind? Do not try to resist, Signor Johnson. Let me go ... Release the ... Why are you killing me? I do not want to die! Let me ...! Stop it! Put him in the car And I will drive off a cliff. - Hey. - Hey, what do you want? - I - Frank. - A son of Lady Grant. I just wanted to say ... - ... If you need something ... - No, thank you ... But thanks anyway. Very nice of you. My next door. At any time ... Okay ... you do not mind I could move around the park? I did not sleep very well, I need some fresh air. Of course, having fun. Give me a few minutes. - You're going to look for a job? - I think so. Actually, I think look for something outside the city. I like the village. And I think there bored. You see, I wanted to to work in the theater. Decorator ... tinkering all sorts of things. Something like that ... I have a good yield. - Seriously? - Yes. Truth is good. No kidding. Well, that's the only what I can do. I hope you will. It's great when you manage combine work and hobby. Cool yeah that's great! But it is not at all impossible. And yet I have too. But you must continue to aspire to. Do not give up. You know, Margaret ... What? You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. Thank you. I'm sorry you was in trouble, Margaret. It is not, I just there are some problems. But I wanted to pack it. Let's take a little bit. Child, I was walking here with my father. I do not remember much of it. You know, he died ... Drowned. What? Drowned? Yes. He sailed on a boat ... She rolled over. My father did not know how to swim. Managed to save only the mother. And it ... have not been found. It was in all the papers ... Is there something wrong? Nothing, nothing ... Poor sleep, that's all. Yes, remember ... - ... A nightmare. - Of course. Why do you put? I can tell. I wrongly accused. Really? It is true. I was at a party. Someone brought the grass or wheels, whatever. And police said, it was me. - And I'm someone else. - Why say that? I do not know. Maybe that to save his own skin. But it was a mistake. I did not do anything. I believe you. - It was awful? - Yes, I thought I was going crazy. And you really do bad is that? No, Frank. It's nothing. But why did you put in jail? It happens. And this time it happened to me. You would hate me, If I was guilty? No. Then why this prolonged interrogation. Because I need to know everything. You do not believe me, do you? Signor Dries says I should not ... No. You do not believe me. Like your mother ... And most of all, as my social worker. - Look, I'm ... - No, leave me alone. I'm sick of your hypocrisy. I can not of itself care, without your help. But I ... Margaret ... what are you doing here? I hate to bother you, Signorina Sundberg ... But I have to ... talk to you. Of course, Margaret. Come on. Sit down. Make yourself at home. So what's the problem? - Signorina Sundberg ... - Just call me Alicia. Alicia ... I want to leave this house. Why? Something wrong? I do not know. Did it's just my imagination. My nerves are on edge. I have to go. Why do you have to go? They seem like nice people ... But ... their attitude towards me to really bother me. As if they were constantly condemn me. I can not it anymore. If you're unhappy there, then have to leave. We will find a place where you like it. I'll take care of itself. Just make some calls. I'll do that right now. Alicia ... I know it's not good on my part ... but could you lend me some money? I did not ask to be, if not was in dire straits. But I can not just leave of Lady Grant. She said, I can not stay, while I will not ... enough money to pay it. It can not make you stay. But I had there leave your things. You know what ... we have to give you a fresh start. I have about 50 dollars. I have to leave for a couple of days, but I do not need so many. If that is all you have, then do not worry. Here, let this ... Here are twenty dollars. As long as you live in a hotel. When I get back, we find a better place. With Signora Grant I'll take care of. This I'm good at. No. I can not accept them. You already so much for I did, Alicia. I just put up with it. And stay at the Lady Grant. There is no alternative. Hey, wait there for two days. And when I get back, we'll work it out. Now, take that money. You can go to a museum or a movie, just try to have fun. But then you run out of money. Do not worry. I'll manage somehow. Take it, come on. I'm sorry. We need to talk. Please wait a while then follow me. It's so horrible. Yes, terribly. I just I can not believe it. Signor Whitman, and that Grant told Signora? Please call me Jack. She spoke little. She said she knew her badly. That she has always been on its own. She was dating a guy but then broke up with him. He fell in love with another and they were married. But I already knew all that. And even talking to him. His name is Charlie. He is an American and lives here for some time. For him, death Go was also absurd. The sister was not one of those who can to commit suicide. She loved life too. So I do not believe in her suicide. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. It's not like her. I think there are people who can commit suicide ... ... And people who never also, if you know what I mean. Yes. The desire to kill himself ... ... Does not appear out of nowhere. - It is always inside. - It does not touch Go. Look, I do not want to draw you in trouble ... but if you notice anything strange, let me know? Of course, Jack. You can count on me. - Your order. - Here ... It smells delicious. We will order more coffee. Is there something wrong? Hey, Jack, your sister Were there any problems? That is ... She had trouble with the law? Of course not. So what? Nothing ... I just thought, there may be a connection. No, I do such a stupid thing. I'll show you, sir Dries. Very good work out. Just a second. Here you go. There are similarities? - Great, is not it? - Extremely. Jack ... What brings you here? Do not just stand there, come on. We need to talk. Sit down. - You want a beer? - No, thank you. Get away. Claire will be soon. She went out for a while. I want you to meet. She's a great girl. How is your sister ... Sorry, just slipped out. You know how it is. I still can not believe it. Sometimes I ... It's fine. Life goes on. Right. Have you ever met Go after your break up? - Well, I was with Claire and ... - I know, but still ... Have you seen her ... or not? Once or twice. You know how it is. - Damn, Jack, I feel ... - It does not matter. I'm not interested your relationship with Edie. I want to find out how she died. If she had any trouble? - No, absolutely. - What about the house? What is home? Grants house where she lived. Why she moved there? I do not know. - Maybe ... to start life anew. - What for? How do I know? People sometimes commit insane acts. But they do not kill yourself for no apparent reason. That's right, you're right. What else can I say? - You want a beer? - No, thank you. O. .. hello. Claire, it's - Jack. Jack Whitman, brother of Go. Jack, this is - my wife, Claire. Nice to meet you. Sorry for the unexpected visit. No, I'm glad you stopped by. Charlie often says about you. Very nice to meet you. Once I saw your sister. She was a beautiful girl. I know that. It was probably very suppressed the incident. What happened? Claire had in mind ... Well, you know, be one in a foreign city. Is that all right? Tell me what happened. - Do not worry, Jack, really. - Speak! What happened? Tell him, Charlie. He should know. Well, Jack. We are in a heap of history. My friend and I cheated with traveler's checks. Make a foreigner here it is easier than ever. You tell about the loss and sell them for half price. Or buy them, as we did. And then ... cashable, before you report the loss. We had quite a lot of connections, through which we received them. With fake documents Else make it easy. Too easy. Go was involved in this? No, not really. I give you my word. Sometimes I leave it at home checks and some documents. Or call to someone. Well, you know, to agree for a meeting or something. And that's it. And then one day all went awry. Suddenly ... We caught. They watched for a while for us. And all of us know. - Come And went to jail? - Yes. For a few weeks. The charges against her were flimsy, and she received a year of probation. We Willy received three years. Conditionally ... Like this we muddled through. That's all, Jack. Absolutely. Really? And why she lived Lady in Grant? I do not know. Someone probably sent her there. Maybe in prison know those who are willing to shelter the girls. - What will you do now? - I do not know. Continue to ask questions, I guess. Look, Jack ... if anything necessary, that is ... If you need ... my help, call me. Call me anytime, okay? Well, Charlie. I'd like it to pro forgot everything. I'm scared for him. Frank, you will need to take Signor Marlowe to the villa. Yes, I know, sir Dries. I recorded it. - Excellent. - We will be on time. I look forward to it. Looking for something? You scared me. I was looking for the bathroom. At the end of the corridor on the right. Thank you. It's easy to get lost is not it? Yes. Perhaps you had better not wander too far away from your room. - Goodbye, signora Grant. - Goodbye. Thank you for coming. Your meetings at the highest degree extravagant. Father, I know you do not agree with our ideas, but ... I came here as a friend, Mary, not as an opponent. - Visit me from time to time. - Certainly. - Drink tea. - How would you like. But let me tell you, what you preach, is absurd. That you can not compensate John's death. Avenge him useless. Do not you understand? - That you do not understand. - Oh, of course. You reject any idea justice, if it is not yours. How can you protect corrupt secular laws? Current laws only give interest in the crime, but not punished. Your words are monstrous. You do not just hand off. - Jack! Where are you here? - This is my room. Come and take a look, as there is beautiful. You're crazy. Hey, I do not like it. You're so you can easily get into me. Let's try ... No, Jack, do not. You break it. For your sake, I'm ready and not on that. But there is a better idea. Are you coming to me for breakfast. And if you do not come, you jump? No, you just stay without breakfast. Is there anything I Naquin. From this room a lovely view. Yeah, on my window. But now I know ... - Chair for the guests. - Comfortably. Well, it's a Hilton. - How did you shot this room? - Let me tell you a secret. I made friends with the concierge. Just to be with you. - You know, I feel like much safer. - Is it true? By the way, I remembered something. On the day when I came here, man following me. Then I gave this value. But yesterday I saw him again. I'm sure it was the one who followed me. And the strangest thing I saw him at the Lady Grant. I do not know ... coincidence? No, something is hidden behind it. Are you interested in whether they had my sister any problems. - Yes. - And why not? Her case could be similar to mine. You know, I arrested by mistake. Have all turned out, but the fact remains ... I spent two weeks in jail. Go too, was in prison. And it is likely that other the girl who lived in the room 2A. But how do we make? It is necessary to carry out investigation. Listen ... We need to check all the shops in the area. And, in particular, laundry ... Find out if someone lately ... Delivery ... did someone who lived in the house of the grant. We need only the name, to start digging. Not a bad idea. Let's try it. I'm sure we dig up anything. I am happy that you're helping me. And I'm happy, I help you. From the moment we met, I I feel much happier. - This is madness? - Yeah. Need a straitjacket. Margaret ... - Hey. I was going to leave. - Hi, honey ... I would like to introduce you with the same girl. Can you give a second? Sorry, Signora Grant but I'm already late. - Maybe later? - Sorry, I was hoping ... Let's do so again. I'm sure you'll be good girlfriends. You have a lot in common. - See you later, honey. - Goodbye. 'm Sorry, Mary, she was in a hurry. And I would like you to meet. We will look at Another time, signora Grant. - You have a cute house. - Thank you. Sit down. Have you seen a picture our vacation home? Seen. He's very handsome. One day, I'll take you there. Margaret I, too, had promised. I look forward to. I like the village. In this house, I feel purified himself. I feel like the world ... - ... Becomes clearer. - Maybe it's a wonderful feeling. Whole-illusion, my dear. In fact, the world ... ... It's just a cesspool. One of the girls called Williams, I found it in the laundry. Its new address on the card. We are lucky. In the laundry room it was unpaid bill. It paid some of its relatives by the name of Craig. Siniora Grant rented housing only foreign girls ... who have had problems with the law. The second turning on the right, then directly. By do not drive through. - Far? - No, you're almost there. The strange thing is that Craigie always talked ... Only ... with the Americans, here in Rome. Only the Americans come here. We're here. Cross your fingers. - I'm sure it's here? - Yes. Signorina Williams? Was until last year. Now I Signora Craig. Sarah Williams? No, my sister Sarah. And she is at home now? No. She does not live here anymore. What's the matter? You can tell where she is? I'm trying to figure out as my sister died. She lived in the same place where Sarah. That is, Lady Grant? Yes, it is. Come. Sarah has always been a restless girl, even as a child. She had a talent ... ... A great talent for painting. But unfortunately ... ... She was too nervous. - How she was in the room 2A? - I do not know. In what appears its instability? She was constantly depressed. She was getting worse and worse, and I was afraid ... That ... it can kill you. With each passing day it became more and more depressed. And in the end, she could not Nothing to do even at home. Just cried and did not get out the whole day out of bed. She cried for hours. And she does not have to help. Then, suddenly, she felt better. She said that she met with great people ... And finally ... felt alive. What did she mean? I do not know. She's probably talking about mystical or spiritual experience. Something like that. My sister's not crazy, just ... Poor thing ... always looking for something that could not find. Where is she now? You can talk to her? As I said, Sarah crazy, but simply unsustainable. Now she is in the hospital, poor girl. And until it does not get through. What happened? I do not know. One morning her found on the farmer ... ... All bruised, as if she was severely beaten. Siniora Craig ... Maybe it sounds silly, but can not we see her? Just for a few minutes? - Sarah with no one talking. - This is very important. - You can at least try? - Please ... Well ... Well ... The clinic around here. Please, signora. - It's so horrible. - Do not wrap yourself. It is found? Near Manziana? Yeah, right. And the police did not found? Investigated, but to no avail. Sarah, I have for you good news. You now have company. Came your sister. She did not say no two days words, just looking out the window. You'd better not stay for long. Hello, Sarah. How are you? Vyglyadesh better. My friends want to talk to you. Maybe you can help them. Sarah, tell me ... Oh my God ... Let me try ... Hi, Sarah, I - Margaret. I live in the same house where do you live, in Grants. You've also lived there? Siniora Grant ... You remember her, Sarah? And her son ... Frank? A bad man, Signor Dries ... Remember him? A room 2A, it's was your room? What do you remember Sarah? This is done to you Grant? They have taken you that night in the village? Can you remember where? What's with you doing there? - I told you, it's useless. - Let it still tries. Okay, but you do it shall not get anywhere. What a beautiful picture. It is here you brought in, right? What do you remember about this house? What did they do to you? Something terrible, right? their punishment should fit evil in their souls. (FS Lopez) - What do you remember Sarah? - We have to go. Jack, look at these pictures. Everywhere drawn man in a hood. Yes, I see. Remember, I told about your nightmare? It was also man in a hood. Exactly the same. You see, Jack? It was not a dream.
