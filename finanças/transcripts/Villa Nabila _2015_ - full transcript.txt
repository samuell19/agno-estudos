In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. 23 students went missing after entering Villa Nabila, located at Jalan Skudai, Johor Bahru. The students were reported missing since 16 November last year. I am Daniel Matiin, an independent film maker. I'm going to share with you my documentary about Villa Nabila. An old and abandoned mansion that became a hot topic among Malaysians on 18 November 2013... when 23 students went missing. Now, I'll bring you to the mansion to have a closer look. Let's have a look. We received a report on 18 November, 1:10 in the morning. It was said that his son have not come home since 16 November, at 3:30 PM. He was told by his son's friends that he he went near to Villa Nabila. This is where the 23 students disappeared shocking Malaysians on 18th November 2013. It was confirmed that a boy and his girlfriend had gone missing. According to the rumours, this mansion is haunted. So, I want to share with you my experiences in this haunted mansion. I am with my friend, Rosalli Azrin, interviewed the missing boy, Mohammad Izzat. During the interview, he did not provide clearer answers All of his sentences were incomplete. What was the story? Were you possessed by spirits? It's not that we didn't want to return home but we just couldn't remember anything. We couldn't remember our parents' number, where we live or where houses are. So you couldn't remember anything, like you had memory loss? Izzat said that he was going to town, but I saw him entering that haunted house. I don't know what Villa Nabila is all about. I was scared to go inside. But my son was in there. So, I contacted the police for help. After receiving the police report, we took immediate action, supported by the fire unit and the police dog unit (K9) to conduct the investigation. We continued the investigation until the morning, but we failed to find the said missing student. I was born in Johor Bahru. A lot of people are talking about Villa Nabila. That place is said to be haunted and spooky. According to rumours, the mansion is vacant because there was a murder. I'm now at the first floor of Villa Nabila. I'm sure the graffiti paintings are work of drug addicts. On that morning, I see many media and reporters gathered at the mansion to receive latest updates. It was at that time that a rumour spread that 23 students had gone missing and they were heard crying for help. We can't proceed to second floor because there's no floor base. The second floor is a no-go area. There's no floor base unless we to try to jump over the gaps. The interview with the deputy police chief gave us lots of leads. The police concluded that the students were not missing. Based on my observation that morning after hanging around that area, I still believe that the boy did not go missing in the mansion. I don't believe he was abducted by spirits. The police called me around 1 o'clock, saying that my son has been found. This is the third floor, the top floor of Villa Nabila. We can see from here. I think places like this will have spirits since this mansion has been vacant for a long time. I'm not sure whether the case of the missing students is fake. Only the locals know the truth. I can't talk about the mansion, even though I know the story. We keep the truth to ourselves. We have heard many stories about this mansion. Some said a person called Nabila was murdered and buried there. Some said people had committed suicide in there as well. So, are all these true? I have no comment as I don't have any information about those stories. My friend brought me back. I couldn't remember anything. I stayed overnight at my friend's house. Next day, the Ustaz came to heal me. After that, I fell asleep. Later that night, the police came. Now, we go to the swimming pool and have a look. The swimming pool is over there. The path to the pool is very dark. Without the camera lights, we would not able to see. This is how dark it will be without the lights. Light up! The swimming pool has turned into a swamp. And the water colour is like... The sounds of the crickets and frogs make it really creepy here. There's nothing other than that. It's creepier inside. The tree roots and moss are everywhere. We concluded that the missing 23 students, and the crying for help never happened. Never happened. I hear what everyone has to say about it. They're not the ones who lost their son. I'm the one. They don't understand. If he was not found, I wouldn't know what to do. I felt weird when the police came to my friend's house and told me that I was reported missing in Villa Nabila. Who said I had gone missing in Villa Nabila? I have suffered some memory loss, but I'm still here. The rumours about him going to his girlfriend's house amongst others were not true. I wonder why this notice was pasted at the abandoned mansion. It's a notice to demolish probably for the owner. But I don't think the owner will become because this place is abandoned. We never posted any notice. It's just an announcement. The mansion is on private land, it's not from the police side. Perhaps it's from the local town council. The demolition notice triggered us to look for the contractors involved in the demolition project of Villa Nabila. After the episode of the missing boy, demolition work started. However, the mansion was never demolished. We were told that the place is really spooky and haunted. Really? - Yes. I want to tell you, but my boss has forbidden it. All employees have been told to be silent on this matter. Besides yourself, is there anyone else that I can speak to? You can find Pak Asyraf. On the following day, I went to look for Mr. Asyraf as recommended by Junaidi. He stays far from Villa Nabila. When we arrived at his house, he wasn't home. Luckily his wife was around and she gave us his phone number to contact him. We tried calling him throughout the day, but he only answered the next morning. And he met us later on the same night. During the meeting, I asked him the same questions that I asked Mr. Junaidi. I found it hard to believe what Mr. Asyraf shared with me. Since I had been there myself, I felt his story is unbelievable, a bit far fetched. I can tell you, but you must not show my face. Manaf asked us to keep this story secret. After that meeting, we searched for a production house to co-produce this documentary. Mr. Asyraf's story required a lot of resources to produce. To produce a good documentary, we needed a solid production house. Eventually, we met Syafiq Yusof who still doesn't believe the story is true. I convinced him and brought him to Johor to meet Mr. Asyraf. After that meeting, Syafiq suggested reenacting the story that Mr. Asyraf told us. The following is the reenactment, directed by Syafiq Yusof based on the experiences of Mr. Asyraf and Mr. Amar, the former workers of Villa Nabila demolition project - I'm Asyraf. - I'm Amar. I'm going to tell you my experiences during the demolition of Villa Nabila. On the first day, we arrived at the demolition site at 7 o'clock in the morning. When I looked at the site, I knew this was the well-known mansion, Villa Nabila. So I went to meet my boss and told him, "Boss, this place is haunted." Boss, this place is eerie. Then, Asyraf came. Before the missing boy case, There were lots of stories about this mansion, which made me feel uncomfortable. - When did you arrive? - A while ago. Pak. - This is the mansion. - This is it? Pak, we should pray before we enter the mansion. Let's pray. I was the first assistant to my boss. This was the first time my boss secured such a big project. Usually, we worked on drainage and landscaping projects. Our biggest project was to construct a single-storey house. Is this place really haunted? I have no idea, Asyraf. I've heard a lot of stories about this place. Such as, a girl was buried in the wall, teenagers went missing, and a family was murdered here. I have no idea what is the truth. Why do they want to demolish it? It will look good if it's renovated. This place doesn't trouble anyone. Since I accepted this job, I just follow the instructions. If I turn down the job down now, we will all be in trouble. - We need this work to pay the bills. - Of course. It's OK. God willing, let's get it done. Bro, the roots are huge. We need to clear all of it. Otherwise, we're not going to be able to break down the wall. I know that! There were six of us in total. When I went into the mansion, I felt it was too big for the six of us to demolish. It's so huge. Do you think we have enough workers? Technically, it's not enough. I will hire some more workers. We could use the hoe or hammer to break down the wall. But to demolish the mansion, we needed to use the backhoe or other equipment. How long has this place been abandoned? It's so huge. Are we going to use a tractor for the demolition? The tractor will come on the fourth day to demolish this place completely. - Will we finish on time? - God willing, we will. This place is so haunted, it will affect our work. Bro, we break down that wall first. You shut up! You don't need to teach me! I know what to do! Ishak, enough! Stop bullying him! Get back to work! It may be haunted, but we still have to work. - This is how we earn our living. - What to do? We need the money. Hey! Are you guys here for vacation? Get to work now! Both of you are just migrant workers! Grab all those things! What are you staring at? Hurry up! Let me help you. Thank you, Pak. After I walked around the mansion... while the guys were breaking down the wall, I found a tile wall that looked easier for me to have a go at. I started swinging my hammer. Suddenly, blood flowed from the wall. Shocked, I went to look for the other workers. Boss! What's wrong? Come! Follow me! What's the big deal? I was curious to see what had happened. When we reached there, there was no blood. I saw blood flowing out from here! Blood? - But, where is it now? - It was here! It's just your imagination. Amar, you help him. - When I got there, there was no blood. - I'm going back to work. I felt it was up to them whether they believed me or not But that was the first time I ever saw such a thing. I really didn't feel like working after that incident. While we tried hard, for some reason, we weren't able to damage the wall. We're not making any progression. We should just ask Manaf to use explosives! I wanted to quit at that moment. The whole JB knows that this place is haunted. Time to go home! Hey, take this! I will wait at the lorry. Asyraf, what's wrong? You still look unsettled. You always seem to enjoy your work. Are you OK? Still thinking about that incident? I don't think I will come to work tomorrow. Don't be like that! I'm short of workers! Why don't you think it over tonight? Try and come tomorrow, OK? My boss was trying to convince me but I didn't want to work there. Boss, I'll go back first. Honey. Are you okay? What's wrong? My new project is at Villa Nabila. I feel that there is something not right about that place. What about it that's bothering you? I went home, showered and prayed. I asked God to give me guidance. - Honey, what's wrong? - Forgive me God. What's wrong? Forgive me God. - Honey, aren't you working today? - No, I'm not. Why? I'm not comfortable working there. Then, what is your plan? I will look for another job. You do know that the boy didn't go missing at the mansion. - There's nothing wrong with that place! - That's enough! I've already made up my mind! A lot of strange things happened there. Eventually, I went back to work that morning. If I didn't work, there's no income. Asyraf, look... When I reached, my boss looked panic stricken and dragged me inside. He took me to the wall which had been broken down the previous night. The wall was in its original condition. How come it's like that? I think someone sabotaged us. Someone must have built it up after we left last night. It's impossible. It looks as perfect as it was. Boss. - It must be the ghost. - Enough! Today, we'll work extra hours until late at night. - Amar, bring me the handycam in my car. - Will do, boss. Place it there and let's see who's messing with us. We are going to need a tractor to work efficiently. I agree with you. Let me call them later. The boss gave me his handycam and asked me to hold onto it. Night came and he asked me to place it near the wall to discover what happened in the mansion at night. Next week? We can't delay anymore! I don't have enough workers! The lorry will also be late! Can you come tomorrow? Please do me a favour. OK. I heard screaming while clearing the bush. I realised it was the boss who fell down the stair. When I reached, he was already unconscious. How did you fall off the staircase? I felt someone pulling my leg when I was standing next to it. But I'm not too sure, I could have been careless. Boss, I pray for your speedy recovery. Asyraf. Can you run this project for me? We only have three days left to complete the job. Please help me to complete it. And half of the project earnings will be yours. Let me think about it. Great, go back and think hard about it. Asyraf. I'm counting on you. Please help me. I had to think hard about the boss's offer because I needed the money. I was thinking about the money. At that time, I really needed the money. Honey! Honey. - Why didn't you use the inhaler? - Honey. It's finished. - Okay.. - Asyraf! Give me a minute, honey. Asyraf! Asyraf! What's up? You know what's up. When will you pay me back my money? Probably next week. You've been saying that for weeks. I need the money for my family. Please be considerate. I'll buy a new inhaler for you. Honey, I know we are short of money. When I was at the clinic earlier... The doctor told me that I'm pregnant. Come. What happened to the boss really scared me. But I felt I didn't have any options other than going back to work with the other workers. I remembered Junaidi had chopped off the weeds yesterday but the weeds were still there. So, I went in to look for Junaidi. Junaidi, yesterday didn't you... Pak, the wall is back again to its origin state. The wall that we demolished had returned back to its original condition. I really didn't know what to do. That goes the same to everything we did. Amar, let me have a look. - Is this boss's camera? - Yeah. What was recorded? It's so dark. I have no idea. I placed the camera here yesterday. This place would be pretty dark at night. Without a night vision setting, the recorded video was really dark We do not know what had happened. Hey! MBJB is here. What should we do? Sir, sir! Sorry, you can't go upstairs because it's dangerous. Is Mr. Manaf around? He was admitted to hospital last night. I'm in charge now. So you're the boss now? What's your name? - Asyraf. - Mr. Asyraf. I'm just letting you know that we needed this mansion to be demolished in five days. But after three days, I don't see any progress. Are you facing any problems? No, the problem is... During the days, we broke down the walls and cleared the backyard But every morning,... it looked untouched. We can't explain why. Maybe there's a disturbance. Disturbance? What kind? Anyhow, Mr. Asyraf, I would like to remind you this is a government project. And you'll still need to complete it within the time frame. Otherwise, we are not going to pay and you may be charged. Mr. Asyraf, I'm just doing my job. But I do hope you understand the consequences and try to co-operate with us. I'm leaving now. Thank you, Mr. Asyraf. Pak, what happened? I have so many problems. Let's work together and resolve them. Where's Jaapar? Jaapar had a high fever last night and was vomiting blood. This wall is back again? Didn't we break it down twice? - It's magical! - That's enough! We'll get as much done as we can today. Why are you acting like the boss? You are just a worker like us! Boss asked me last night to take over this project. What should we do if MBJB comes back again? Tonight, we'll stay here. Let's see if anything happens then. All of us agreed to stay overnight in the mansion. Meanwhile, we tore down as much as we could. I suggested to Asyraf to bring two backhoes or hire more workers so we could complete the job faster. But it wasn't me who had the budget. So, I agreed with him and made some calls for assistance. - Hello, any updates? - So we can complete the work on time. Great. You know that I've been working longer than Asyraf? Why did boss promote him? He must be a boot-licker. Do you really want me to tell you why? You should reflect yourself. You never turn up on time. You bully the other guys and don't finish your work properly. I think Asyraf is better than you. You are just like him. A boot-licker! Bro, who is going to retrieve it? You, of course! Then, who will break down the wall at the back? I can't do it alone! Ask the others! How am I going to get it out? We didn't know why Khairul didn't stay overnight with us. He just informed me that he didn't want to stay. That night, I brought two cameras along. One was mine, the other belonged to the boss. Amar, why did you set up the camera there? What can you record from there? Are you recording this fool? He's not even handsome. I want to record anything that happens outside here. I've placed my camera inside the mansion. Please don't disturb me. Do you have it? I just want to know whether you have it. I want to use the backhoe tomorrow. So, you need to let me know soon. - OK. - Pak, what should we do? Khairul went home. If we can't get the JCB tomorrow, what should we do? - Why don't we continue working now? - Calm down. "Real footage" - Amar, where's the spotlight? - I didn't bring it. Amar, did you bring the spotlight? I didn't. We don't have budget to rent a generator. Bro. Are you scared? What's your problem? Shut up! You think you're brave? If you're so brave, let's sleep inside and see what happens! - I don't care who you are! - I'm not scared! - Why are you hassling me? - Chill, chill! I dare you to go in! If you're so brave, let's go in together without the flash light! Come, follow me. - That's enough. - Let's do this together! Just ignore him. There were so many problems to be solved, yet all they could do was argue. Ishak was a troublemaker. Dear, I'm not coming home tonight. If anything, just call me. Where is Amar? "Real footage" "Real footage" Dear God, what now? "Real footage" What happened? I'm not too sure. It felt like someone touched my shoulder. Come on, I told you to stay put! Don't make matters any worse, please! It felt like someone touched my shoulder. Suddenly, we heard Ishak screaming. We ran into the mansion to have a look. "Real footage" Ishak! Ishak! - What's happening? - Forgive me God! - Pray to God! Ishak! - This looks like a satanic ritual! Ishak! Ishak! Ishak! What's happening to you, Ishak? What's this? Ishak! Amar! Ishak, pray to God! God is great! Ishak! Ishak! Amar, come and help us! I put down the camera and went to help. - He wasn't himself. - He looked like he was possessed. We couldn't control him. - Junaidi and I helped him. - We prayed. - We asked him to pray to God. - We asked him to pray to God. We tried to get Ishak out of the mansion. Why are we here again? What's happening, Pak? What is going on? No worries, let's just continue walking. Something is not right. "Real footage" - Pak, there is a door! - Let's go. - Hurry up! - Let's go. I followed them from the back but it seemed as if we were walking in circles. "Real footage" I think we were just here. Put him down. I'm so worried. What should we do? At that moment, we felt like laughing, but scared at the same time. We didn't know what to do. I don't know how to describe it. It's hard. After that, I fell unconscious. Ishak. Ishak. Junaidi! Amar! Asyraf! Junaidi! - Amar! - Help me, Asyraf! Pak! We can't leave him behind! Hurry up! "Real footage" When I regained consciousness, I saw Ishak was very weak and it was all so chaotic. Then, we helped him get away from Villa Nabila and we ran outside. "Real footage" Junaidi and I brought Ishak to the nearest mosque near Villa Nabila. After that, I took a taxi home. I couldn't care less about the project at Villa Nabila anymore. Sir, please wait for awhile. When I reached home, my wife's car was not around. Hey, Asyraf! Where have you been? Where is my wife's car? She went to look for you because you were missing for two days already. - Where did she go to look for me? - How should I know? Sir, let's go. Honey! "Real footage" "Real footage" Honey! Honey! Honey! Amar, you have to go back to the mansion now. Listen to me, go back to the mansion now! Call everyone! Do you hear me? Honey! Honey! Honey! Honey! Please drive faster. Could you hurry? Thank you, uncle. Huda! I can't describe how I felt at that moment. "Real footage" Huda! Huda! Huda! Huda! Honey! Huda! Dear! Huda! Dear! Honey! Dear! Huda! Huda. I couldn't think of anything. I'm not sure of what I heard or saw. I just blacked out. "Real footage" He is inside, Ustaz. Quickly, Ustaz! Separate them! Bring him over here. Dear! Dear! Dear! Dear! Dear! Pray to God, dear! Ustaz! This our baby, dear. Pray to God! It's our baby! "Real footage" "Real footage" I was relieved that my wife and the baby were safe. As a Muslim, I believe in the existence of the supernatural. But we need not to be afraid of it. Even though you can't see spirits, don't arrogantly go to those places. I was angry when I shared my experience with my friends and they wanted to experience the Villa Nabila themselves. I shared my experience just so they know how dangerous the supernatural world can be. I was upset because they thought they could handle it. My advice is, stop being arrogant or you'll face the consequences. This incident was a test for me where God wants me to know the importance of Him. What can I conclude as someone who had stayed overnight there before even meeting Junaidi... When my friend Rosalli left me alone with the camera, I couldn't feel or see anything abnormal about the place. So, I'm not sure about the reliability of Mr. Asyraf's story, whether true or not, that I'm not sure. But, regarding the story of the wall that they tore apart and it kept coming to its original condition, honestly just doesn't feel right, because I've never heard a story like that before. Like Syafiq said, Syafiq does not believe the story is real, but it served as a good base for a movie. Honestly, what I can say is... the screenplay and the truth of this story depends on what you think. We have called Mr. Manaf for further information Hello. - Hello, may peace be upon you. - May peace be upon you too. - Is this Mr. Manaf? - Yes. - I... - Who are you? My name is Rosalli Azrin. We're making a documentary about Villa Nabila. So, we'd like to ask you the authenticity of Villa Nabila rumour that we got from Mr. Asyraf and Mr. Amar. What story? The story about the demolition of Villa Nabila. Would you, sir? - I have nothing to tell you. - Nothing? But I have video recorded by them that proved... What video? Videos that captured the incidents in Villa Nabila. - Who gave you the videos? - Pardon? Who gave you the videos? Mr. Amar. Do not believe what they have told you. Villa Nabila still exists in Danga Bay, Johor Bahru
