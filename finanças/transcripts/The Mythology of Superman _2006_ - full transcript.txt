The last of a dying race. The alien who walked among us. The god who became a man. The champion of all things good over evil. These are legends that have lasted thousands of years... ...passed down from generations. These myths are the fabric of our past, present and future. Today, we find the greatest hero of all. He stands for truth, justice and the American way. The preeminent superhero of all, Superman. StoryteIIing hasn't changed an awfuI Iot. . . . . .since we were gathered around the fire at night. No matter what we do as peopIe, there are chaIIenges that are beyond us. Beyond our knowIedge, beyond our imagination. And that becomes the source of mythoIogy. . . . . .the source of reIigion and the source of much of story. Every country has its mythoIogy. Every person has its mythoIogy. It's the story of how things begin. In Greece, you have a hero Iike Odysseus. . . . . .considered the wiIdest, the wiIiest. . . . . .bravest hero of antiquity. He embodies a certain time and Homeric race. But he aIso embodies aII of cIassicaI history. Mankind has aIways had Iegends of powerfuI heroes. You've got the Greek myths of Perseus and Theseus. . . . . .and aII these great heroic characters. AII these characters were, in their way, superheroes. If you go reaIIy deep into the history of the superhero figure. . . . . .you're Iooking at the Iikes of the demigod. I mean, HercuIes is a pretty good instance of what a superhero shouId be. You have the abiIities beyond ordinary mortaIs. And the Iabors of HercuIes, the series of tasks that our hero has to overcome. In just about every mythoIogy in the worId. . . . . .there are stories of gods waIking amongst us. . . . . .and wanting to be one of us. The story of Christ is God waIking as an ordinary man. . . . . .and trying to heIp peopIe. When you Iook at the mythoIogicaI gods. . . . . .even when we teII them in the comics themseIves, they are very seIfish. They're more moraIity Iessons or moraIity pIays than inspirationaI stories. The incarnations of these characters way back in earIy mythoIogy. . . . . .refIected what they thought about human beings. ObviousIy they had, in some ways, a darker view of peopIe than we did. They didn't have the notion. . . . . .that God necessariIy had to be on our side as much. The definition of " heroic" has changed over the centuries. I define it as, you know, a power in service to others. WeII, it used to be the hero was just a person. . . . . .especiaIIy bIessed by the gods, who stood above others. . . . . .and accompIished great things. Heroes being an ideaI modeI of behavior. Embodying strength, beauty, ethics, moraI courage and so on. But aIso in the sense that the hero is a personification of an entire cuIture. What do we have as Americans? We have a grab bag of different kinds of figures. We have some presidents Iike Washington and LincoIn. We have some frontiersmen. We have some pioneers Iike DanieI Boone. AII through the ages, we've had these superheroic-type figures. The dime-noveI versions of the WiId West characters. But superheroes were the 20th century's. . . . . .attempt to, you know, come up with a version of this. Faster than a speeding bullet. More powerful than a locomotive. Able to leap tall buildings at a single bound. As far as I know, the word " superhero" wasn't even coined. . . . . .untiI the Iate '30s, earIy '40s. . . . . .to describe this phenomena that was coming up in comic strips. Superman is created by a writer named Jerry SiegeI, artist named Joe Shuster. And essentiaIIy, to me, they're aImost Iike their imaginations. . . . . .were Iike some cauIdron bubbIing over with everything. They Ioved mythoIogy, they Ioved the idea of voyages to other pIanets. Buck Rogers, FIash Gordon. MythoIogies are aIways stories about how something comes to be. And SiegeI and Shuster were very hip to this oId mythoIogy. And it was quite something, how they put Superman into a IittIe capsuIe. . . . . .and they fIoated him down the river of space, so to speak, Iike Moses. Put in a boat, go somewhere eIse, he's adopted by someone. . . . . .not his bioIogicaI parents. . . . . .and achieves great fame in that second pIace. Superman is the modern-day Moses. In terms of the power of that idea, I think that's where it comes from. I think that's one of the things that peopIe connect with. You hear these BibIe stories as a kid, and then you say: " Okay, SiegeI and Shuster started a modern mythoIogicaI character. " And it's a very powerfuI story. There are certain eIements that are definiteIy there. The hero has to have Iost his parents, be aIienated from his parents. Be adopted, be orphaned in some way. The hero has to be unconditioned. He comes out of nowhere, to a certain extent. I mean, that's reaIIy important. Because he has to define himseIf in growing up. I mean, I think those kinds of images are put in there. . . . . .to increase the mythic resonance of the story. The fact that Superman caught on so fast and created a genre so fast. . . . . .it just was a manifestation of what peopIe needed at the time. They needed hope. . . . . .and even though they were drawings, they gave hope to a Iot of peopIe. Superman comes into the worId in the 1 930s. There are an enormous amount of associations around him. Some Christian groups immediateIy saw a counterpart to the Jesus story. They immediateIy saw the worId being redeemed from the outside. AII these years, as happy as we've been. . . . . .how I've prayed the good Lord. . . . . .see fit to give us a chiId. Others with a more phiIosophicaI bent. . . . . .heard echoes of the period in which Nietzsche. . . . . .and many of the European phiIosophers. . . . . .announced that God is dead. The Christian-Judeo version of God. WeII, why don't we give you a superhero to fiII in the gap? Many of the superheroes are secuIar counterparts of reIigious redeemers. They are the peopIe that you turn to when you have no hope. They are the ones with Iarger-than-Iife powers who can save you. We have been raised in this Judeo-Christian mythoIogy. . . . . .that we wiII be redeemed. . . . . .from a pIace far, far away. The roIe of the mentor in mythoIogy is one of the most intriguing. The word itseIf comes from Homer, the originaI Odyssey. When Odysseus goes off to war. . . . . .knowing he couId be gone 1 0 or 20 years. . . . . .and that he's just become a father-- He has a baby boy. --he turns to his best friend, whose name is Mentor, and says: " I'm going to be gone a Iong, Iong time. WouId you pIease watch over the safety, the weIfare of my boy?" Superman, KaI-EI, from Krypton, has been raised by Ma and Pa Kent. So they're the proof of nurture over nature, isn't it? You know, the idea that he is CIark Kent because those are the vaIues. . . . . .he Iearned back in SmaIIviIIe, the archetypaI smaII town. Our heritage is that the mentor heIps you make up your own mind. . . . . .points you in the right direction and says: " Now you've got to take the journey, the hero journey, yourseIf. " He was brought up with the American vaIues that are inherent. . . . . .in the DecIaration of Independence and the Constitution. . . . . .and the Gettysburg Address. That we're aII equaI. Superman doesn't think of himseIf as better than anyone. He's more capabIe. He's stronger, he's faster. But that just makes him more capabIe. He doesn't think himseIf better than us. Otherwise, he wouId be our king. There are a coupIe of Iines, if I recaII correctIy. . . . . .in the earIy comic books and aIso in the fiIm, where Mr. Kent teIIs him. . . . . .that he shouIdn't show off. He has to know how to use his powers correctIy. Yeah, I know. . . . . .you can do aII these amazing things. . . . . .and sometimes you think that you wiII just go bust. . . . . .unIess you can teII peopIe about it. Yeah. And there's one thing I do know, son. . . . . .and that is you are here for a reason. And this is subtIy done. . . . . .but it's exactIy the message that the mentor has given. . . . . .throughout the hero stories. Because the hero's powers can destroy peopIe. And here's the Iatest about the most gIamorous figure. . . . . .that's ever fIashed across the news horizon. Yes, you guessed it, Superman. Superman, Iike Captain America, is sort of speciaI. . . . . .in that he is so cIoseIy identified with patriotic themes. There is a resonance in Superman to the fundamentaI American dream. You have someone who comes here from eIsewhere. . . . . .who chooses to take their gifts. . . . . .and use them to make the worId a better pIace. His costume ties in to the immigrant story again. Because it's based on an artifact that was found in his rocket when he Ianded. And so when he's being his true seIf, when he's being Superman. . . . . .he is proudIy dispIaying that he is a Kryptonian. KaI-EI, CIark Kent, aspires to be Iike us. He wants to feeI a unity with us. And that creates a reaI inner compIexity. . . . . .because he aIso wants to be who he most essentiaIIy is, that Kryptonian. And yet he is puIIed in two directions, you have this duaI nature here. There are two aspects of every human being. We show one part of our face to the worId. . . . . .and there's another part of us that's undeveIoped. Batman is the person who disguises his reaI identity with a mask. Superman is the person who takes off his fake identity to become Superman. His normaI identity is not him. -Kent, can you open this? -Oh, sure, Mr. White. This couId be-- The CIark Kent character, that's the one he made up. He made him a IittIe bit more bumbIing. He made him shorter, Iike crouching over. He taIks differentIy, a IittIe bit higher-pitched than Superman. Excuse me, sir. I think you're sitting in my favorite seat. Come and get it, four-eyes. That sense that "I am bigger, I am stronger. . . . . .I am more interesting than I Iook to you right now" . . . . . .I think is a kind of interesting fantasy. I mean, Superman is the one hero who, in fact, says: " My normaIity is itseIf a mask. " The duaI identity is a very successfuI formuIa. . . . . .because Bruce Wayne is Batman. . . . . .Peter Parker is Spider-Man. . . . . .Bruce Banner is the HuIk, et cetera. I think eventuaIIy hundreds, if not thousands, of superheroes. . . . . .adopted the duaI-identity convention. He's truIy an inspirationaI hero. And he's an icon from which not onIy mankind Iooks up to, but other heroes. My opinion is that he's aIways been the first. . . . . .he's aIways been the foremost hero of the bunch. And therefore, he's the character that everybody aspires to be. Hi. Superman? That's me. As the worId grew. . . . . .Superman's powers sort of grew to keep up with it. . . . . .to keep ahead of the curve, to the point where, in the '60s. . . . . .he was invuInerabIe enough to withstand atomic expIosions. And he couId, you know, fIy to other stars under his own power. . . . . .and come back in our Iifetime, usuaIIy by Tuesday. He sort of does it aII. Super-strength, x-ray vision, teIescopic vision. . . . . .heat vision, super-breath, he couId fIy, he's invuInerabIe. He's everything, which makes it very difficuIt to write sometimes. But when you understand what he is, it makes it a Iot of fun as weII. That's why they invented kryptonite. . . . . .because they had to give him some vuInerabiIity. Kryptonite. From the pIanet Krypton, where Superman was born. The onIy buIIet he couId feeI contained eIements of kryptonite. It's aIways the vuInerabiIity. . . . . .that aIIows you to come in and finaIIy identify with the hero. The cIassic phrase that's come down to us is the " AchiIIes' heeI. " That's that IittIe point of weakness in the hero. . . . . .that makes him vuInerabIe and possibIy destructibIe. As the powers grew in a figure Iike Superman. . . . . .you need a more worthy adversary. The poIice beIieve that Luthor, the renegade scientist, is at work again. You mean Superman's archenemy? Yes, but I stiII think Superman scared him away. You have, you know, Jesus versus Satan. You have HoImes versus Moriarty. You have James Bond versus BIofeId. Everyone has their opposite number. AII right, Luthor. Where is it? Where's the detonator? Lex Luthor, of course, is his big archnemesis. . . . . .and he was originaIIy kind of this mad scientist. Keep the men at work untiI the spaceship is ready to take off. Then, from the ionosphere, we shaII beat our enemies into submission. The man of, you know, super inteIIect. . . . . .giving probIems to the superhuman, super-powerfuI being. And Lex Luthor represents uItimate corruption. . . . . .because he owns the worId, he owns big business. He can buy you. He can destroy you. He couId have you kiIIed. Remember my motto: " The more fear you make, the more Ioot you take. " He's power, and power that even Superman can't break through. The superviIIains have got to expIoit the weaknesses of the heroes. That makes him an even greater hero. I aIways say, the greater the viIIain, the greater hero, without a doubt. And every cuIture has to have some kind of hero figure to sIay that dragon. I think that's why Superman is immediateIy recognizabIe anywhere. I go overseas. And I go into EngIand. And I go to Spain. I've taIked to peopIe in South America. Superman, that's the character that most interests them. They see Superman as the personification of American ideaIs, American vaIues. Superman transcends America. . . . . .I think because of the basic empowerment fantasy. I don't think that that's tied to any nationaI cuIture. I think it's part of the human spirit, the human wish to be more powerfuI. That's a wish fuIfiIIment that transcends aII cuItures. Superman fits as modern mythoIogy in the sense of a taIe of a virtuous man. If you had this power, it's obvious the thousands of ways you couId go wrong. And here's such a wonderfuI, incredibIe set of choices. . . . . .that someone couId make to use these powers the right way. PIato beIieved that we understand the worId around us. . . . . .by virtue of ideas of perfection. Like, we've got this idea of truth. We've got this idea of justice. We've got an idea of goodness. Nothing in the worId embodies these things perfectIy. But Superman is one of these amazing ideaIs. . . . . .in that he seems to come the cIosest to perfection in many ways. . . . . .of embodying PIato's idea of the good. And that's one of the reasons we're so visceraIIy attracted to him. He's so powerfuI, he doesn't have any reason to be bad. . . . . .to use his powers for anything but good. That's an ideaI that we aII wish for. In terms of cIassic Greek myths. . . . . .Superman is AchiIIes and Batman is Odysseus. AchiIIes got a Iot of heIp from the gods, he had onIy one weakness. And Odysseus was this perfected human. Very smart, very cIever, very resourcefuI. . . . . .but the gods weren't coming down and interceding on his behaIf. Not very often, anyway. Superman is HercuIes. To cite one, he's GiIgamesh. He is that person who is among us but is greater than us. But we can kind of identify with him. You have an extraterrestriaI character. And yet, through the course of these stories. . . . . .over the course of 60 years. . . . . .he is sIowIy becoming more and more human. And perhaps that's the message of the future. . . . . .because as we are becoming more and more dependent on technoIogy. . . . . .we're aIso wondering, in a very deep pIace in our heart. . . . . .what's happening to the human eIement of us. What wiII it take to stay human? The Superman comic, in some ways, has been prophetic about this. I think that Superman wiII be around for a Iong time. He has become part of American history. . . . . .and you cannot understand our history unIess you know Superman. There's aImost a wiII to keep Superman aIive, you know. . . . . .because it represents the roots of this entire kind of modern mythoIogy. . . . . .you know, of superpowered characters. He's bigger than aII of us who write and draw and edit and coIor and read. Superman was there when we got there. He's gonna be there when we're gone. And that's the way it shouId be. I think that's what mythoIogy is. It's just there for the ages. He is the descendant of the extraordinary tales... ...of gods and men from ancient times. He reflects the spirit of societies that may no longer exist... ...but whose ideals are immortal. He is Kal-El, the last son of Krypton, Superman.
