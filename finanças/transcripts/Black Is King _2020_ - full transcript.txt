A journey is a gift, something to offer at the door to the rooms of your mind. This is how we journey far, and can still always find something like home. The great kings were here long before us, ancient masters of celestial lore. Rikirobo roborebe. Mamsibo robirebi rebi. Let me tell you something my father told me. Skindanu dinda dundun. Look at the stars. Sibirobo roborebe. Oroboskibo robi rebirebi. The great kings of the past look down on us from those stars. Skidin dadun dadun daya.

It could be dangerous. Danger? I laugh in the face of danger. In the jungle Ain't no Bible. Showtime, showtime No recital. Show no fear, boy Where's your spinal? Where's your backbone? Where's your pyro? I had to be everything you couldn't be, for my survival. My own idol Skipped my trial. Took my rightful Rightful title. No remorse The sin is final I found all my own disciples I'm too far gone Down this spiral. No white angels Just albinos. Check my eyes, man They're all white, man. Roll them back now Where'd the light go? Guess it died, so cold like cryo. Crack my neck back like I'm the chiro. Simba! What have you done? Run away, Simba. And never return. No true king ever dies. Our ancestors hold us from within our own bodies, guiding us through our reflections. Light refracted. Hey, little buddy, where you going? I'm not sure but I know I'm still in motion. This ain't regular, I seen regular. These streams may take me out to the ocean. Told myself if I dive in it without precaution of a lifejacket. Then I'll dive in it 'til I'm exhausted and I'm type lackin' Waistline on four deep Senses on four deep. Feel like there's four me. One time I took a swim in the Nile. I swam the whole way, I didn't turn around. Man, I swear It made me relax when I came down I felt liberated like free birds I'm stimulated now. Plunging away unless my body's on top. Stimulated now. All of these currents might cost me my life. Right now. Where danger finds me, it follows with tides. Many miles ahead of me, still I'm in stride. That's some good. Got the Nile runnin' through my body. Look at my natural, I'm so exotic. Darker the berry, sweeter the fruit. Deeper the wounded, deeper the roots. Nubian doused in brown, I'm lounging in it. Fountain of Youth, I said I'm drowning in it I'm in the Nile, deep in denial I'm in the Nile, deep in denial. That's some good. When it's all said and done, I don't even know my own native tongue. And if I can't speak myself, I can't think myself. And if I can't think myself, I can't be myself. But if I can't be myself, I will never know me. So, Uncle Sam, tell me this, if I will never know me, how can you? Look, kid, bad things happen and you can't do anything about it, right? Right. Wrong! When the world turns its back on you, you turn your back on the world. Only embrace what's next! And turn the "what" into "so what?" Well, that's not what I was taught. Well, then maybe you need a new lesson. Repeat after me, kid. "Hakuna matata." I know my enemy prey on me So pray for me. Tick, tick, wait on it I'm keepin' down my body count. I'm finessin' like a trap bounce, a trap bounce, yeah. 'Cause every day above ground is a blessing I done leveled up Now my view panoramic. None of my fears can't go where I'm headed.

Duality, the balancing of, um, good and evil. All of this is what you need to make a move. Understand that good and evil often appear together. Nothing is complete on its own. There's an ongoing exchange between dark and light. You know, what we call good and what we call evil. The king is representative of you, is representative of the soul. It's not always a battle. It's a conversation. The king is... The king is you. I don't know if that sounds right. Anyway, you are the king. Our brothers and sisters are walking around with crowns in their back pockets because of an environment of repression. You no forget o. Shey you get the concept. Dem go tell you watch out.
