Glad you guys want to be an adoptive family I have to explain to you Adoption is very different from foster care Adoption is a family for life many things to measure Including your financial situation, your family situation Does Uncle Bin know? Actually, I want to adopt Xiao Hua according to the adoption code Adoptive families cannot choose which child to adopt What's the meaning? Actually, I also want to tell you... There is an American couple who are very suitable for adopting Xiaohua Has recently completed the initial approval process Xiao Hua lives very well in our house I think Xiaohua likes to follow us very much Don't worry we are very cautious We had many meetings to decide That American couple will be responsible for all of Xiaohua's language training orthopedic surgery expenses It's a great opportunity for Xiaohua we will also... I will also take her out to play, and I will also buy things for her I never got reimbursed I've known you for so long, of course I know But we have many more things to consider We will score each item individually Is taking care of children a higher score? We don't mean that Have you asked Xiaohua, have you asked us? How can you make a random decision? You listen to me I'm just as nervous as you are kids but if we can take good care of them until you find one that suits them best a home you can rely on forever a blessing for them they always have their way Xiao Hua is definitely not the only child you can help wife Why don't we keep a dog?
