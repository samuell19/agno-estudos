Hattori in the west, Kudou in the east We are equally popular But Kudou is really outstanding Using the strange machines invented by Dr. Agasa He has broken many cases Besides the doctor and me.. there're other people knowing his real identity Kudou's father and mother And Kudou's classmate Haibara Ai This kid.. He used to be the partner of the man in black But after he got out of the organization She was forced to drink the poison so her body shrank too I have a childhood partner She's Tooyama Kazuha a nagging woman Who's nagging? Hey Don't show up without any notice Pighead You are the pighead Who are you talking to? Come on I'm explaining to the audience Right? Are you crazy? You are crazy!

Don't forget to cover the belly That has never happened to me idiot Yoshinoyama Stepping on the white snow in the mountains in order to look for any living signs You are not Yoshitune and Shizuka Gozen What's wrong? You are worried about your childhood friend? My father is being nagging now I gotta go Ah..hey Come on I have to call when he's not there next time Yoshitune and Shizuka Gozen Haven't they met each other after the departure? Hey..hey (Tokyo Nishikunitati) (Kamei no Rokurou) (Kataoka no Hatirou) (Washinoo no Shitirou) Benkei is so slow Right..he claims that he has solved the problem Because that guy is very interested in this Kataoka (Osaka, during the night) (Neyagawa City, Takohei) (Bizen no Heishirou) (Kyoto, during the dawn) (Tosan District, Zirou Bar) (Suruga no Zirou) According to the investigation The five victims murdered in Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto used to be the members of the robbery ring, Genzihotaru As to this incident.. Satou They say Captain Aynokouzi in Kyoto Police Precinct used to be the Shiratori's classmate Yes As the descendant of an imperial minister he is nicknamed Captain Royalty Look at his left pocket What is that? That is his pet, a squirrel He always carries it no matter where he goes He's weirder than Shiratori Starting from the year of 1991 Genzihotaru has been stealing famous Buddhist statues or artifacts around Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka areas They call each other by the name of the servants in the Yoshitune's Every one of them has a Yoshitune Book Yoshitune is the leader There are totally 8 members including Benkei and Ise no Saburou Five of them have been killed and their Yoshitune Books have been taken away Do you have any clues? We only know the murder is good at sword craft and using arrows As to Yoshitune, Benkei, and Ise no Saburou We don't know their age or gender.. However In order to round up the other accomplices We'll do our best in the investigation (Hattori's Residence) Yoshitune is the leader of the robbery ring Heiji, are you there? Come on Isn't this very important? Yes.. I have to keep it Heiji..are you going out? Yes..I need to check out something How can I help you? I'd like to invite you to appreciate cherry blossoms in Tomorogi But..forget about it Really? I gotta go Take care then Oh Why do I have to see him off with smiles? Kyoto is really a good place Listen I brought you here with a good will.. Don't interfere with my work Alright No problem Conan has left for Kyoto There is a temple called Sannouzi So Mouri is asked to probe into the case We'd like to go to Kyoto soon I can take you there Really? So I can see Conan there Kyoto..Kyoto.. We'll go to.. But you have to answer these questions.. Here we go You aren't planning to take us there That has nothing to do with this Let him do it Perhaps we can kill some time What can we do? Let's give it a try That's right You know who Benkei is Right? Yes..he's Yoshitune's servant Hey..who's Yoshitune? His nickname is Usiwakamaru On the 5 big bridges in Kyoto He defeated Benkei who wanted to get the 1 000th sword At that time, the Genzi and the Hira were in a war And Yoshitune won However, his brother, Razou hated him At last he killed himself in Hiraizumi no Koromogawa I know a lot about him I'll ask you some questions now Benkei has a lover called Uzune That girl is gonna marry someone else After Benkei knows about this He will be..1.angry 2.happy 3.sad Which one is true? First lover? Of course he will be angry He can't be happy So you think the answer is 1? It's ''sad''.. The answer is 3 You get the idea from ''Benkei's weakness'' Ai is so cool What is ''Benkei's weakness'' Benkei is outstanding.. but he cries when he's hurt too That's here The fore part of the leg is called ''Benkai's weakness'' But does this have anything to do with the question? Uhh.. I see So the groom and Uzune will get married The groom and Uzune Groom Uzune (In Japanese, it sounds like the fore part of the leg) It's not funny at all But..since we've got the right answer We can go to Kyoto now Ah..no Because Ai got the right answer And he's a member of the Youth Detectives Don't estrange Haibara My mom told me to keep my promises Thanks for your patronage Thanks.. That's right But you can't tell others about this (Ryuen, a monk in Sannouzi) Oh..Mr. Mouri Thanks for coming I am Ryuen.. I talked to you on the phone Please allow me to introduce to you This is the master, Enkai These three are the faithful of this temple This is Mr. Sakura Syouzou He's running an antique shop on Teramati Road Are you the famous detective Mouri Kogorou Ah..really? Am I famous? And this one is a young master Mizou Syuntarou This is Mr. Saizyou Taiga the owner of a 2-hand book store Nice to know you Actually the faithfuls and us are friends in swordcraft Everyone is learning swordcraft? No wonder you look so healthy Friends in swordcraft? By the way.. they say in this temple there's a Buddhist statue presented to the public every 12 years Yes That is the main statue of this temple Medicine Buddha And it will be presented for worships the day after tomorrow We are looking forwards to it Thanks to you I bet the Buddha will be delighted What are you saying? The Buddha is gone? Yes..it happened 8 years ago On the left side is Sun Buddha and the right.. Moon Buddha But in the center, Medicine Buddha was stolen I meant to report to the police but the master stopped me He said.. let the fate be He's really optimistic So it's been 8 years now But 5 days ago.. a letter was tossed in the mailbox without any stamps on it There's no sender and it says we can find the statue if we solve the puzzle What map is it? Thanks..sir It's really hard to look for eye-witnesses to this kind of cases There's a thief Get away It hurts You'd better watch out If I hit your Benkei's weakness You'll suffer This is yours..madam Thank you.. You were so great Really..thanks I am running a tea house in Miyagawatyou My name is Yamakura Tae Say hello to them Yes I am Tika Suzu.. Nice to meet you How should I repay you? It's not necessary.. Please drop by my shop next time Take care then Thank you What is this map about? On the 5th layer.. you see cricket, dog, and gold fish And the 4th layer.. chicken and..loach? The yellow loach looks disgusting What is it? It should be just stains And in between the 2nd and the 3rd There are violet, dogs, and Fuji mountain And next to them are nuts Father Can we find it before the day after tomorrow? Don't worry I can handle it.. A piece of cake Hey..is that true Let the experts handle it Let's go visit Kyoto now Go ahead You will only make troubles Actually I talked to Kazuha She will take us to Kyoto tomorrow But she said Hattori will be busy It doesn't matter since he's not available now That guy is not coming Conan..come with us Ah..I'm not going with you I'm going fishing with the kids living nearby Wow..you have made local friends so quickly But you have to be careful I bet Genzihotaru must be the thief But Why is there a map? And is there any connection with the 5 murder cases? Genzihotaru.. Speaking of Yoshitune and Benkei I think that's the only place we should check out (The 5 Big Bridges) I don't see anything related to this mysterious map On the 5 big bridges in Kyoto The strong man, Benkei held his long sword and waved it towards Usiwakamaru Hattori I can't believe I will meet you here It's really interesting for us to meet here Sir..can I have the knife back? Oh..I'm sorry Thanks Let's go You have to practice more Why did you borrow the knife? Let's not talk about this What are you doing here? I wanna ask you this question The owner of an octopus ball shop in Osaka was killed We were very familiar Although he was rumored to be a member of the gang I often visited that shop when I was a student He was nice to me So I wanna find out the murder and take revenge for him That's why you come here to look for the clues If so..I wanna show you something I see Just solve this puzzle You can not only find the statue but also get the clues critical to the murder case That's why you.. Right If Genzihotaru was the one who stole the statue Maybe we can find clues to the puzzle at the places involved with Yoshitune and Benkei But I'm not familiar with Kyoto So..count on me I'll lead you This is the 5 Gods According to Yoshitune Book They didn't first meet on the bridge but at this place So..is there any connection? No..I don't think so So let's go to the next place But I can't accept it Why doesn't the monk ask me for the help? I should be the first one he comes up with in Kansai area They don't want to expose the incident Because your father is a high-ranking police official Forget it Wait..it's really weird We're here.. It's right here Benkei Stone? Benkei often sat on it Someone said he threw it down from Hiezan Mountain There are numerous legends But there's no connection with one another Really.. let's check out the next place Where are we going then? Keage Slope I am a police detective in Kyoto Ayanokouzi You're probing into Genzihotaru's case? This is not Osaka You'd better not get involved It's a squirrel You see? There are strange detectives everywhere (Kiyomizudera Temple) Let's take pictures now I want the cheery blossoms to be the background It's so beautiful It's really beautiful It would be great if Makoto was here too Ran..you are embarrassing me You often do that to me too Kazuha.. You had a quarrel with Hattori? Heiji often comes to Kyoto for a certain case And his first lover also lives in Kyoto (Keage Slope Park) (Yoshitune Sun Buddha) This is not right Let's go have lunch Alright Cheery blossoms It's nothing It reminds me of what happened 8 years ago I had an adventurous trip to temples in Kyoto My head hit the window frame of a temple and the frames were broken and I fell to the ground I fainted and I don't know how long I slept.. When I came to myself I just remembered Passing through 8 avenues I'll get to Tonsi Avenue And the last one is the 9th Avenue Maarutakeebisuni Oshioike Rokakku Bride Takonishiki Shiayabttakamatu Wan 5 units Snow shoes..ding-ding-dong-dong 6 units.. It was like a dream but I'm sure it happened to me I felt someday we'll meet again Hey..what's so funny about it? I'm sorry Please go on I'll take this with me whenever I come to Kyoto Crystal ball? I have seen it somewhere before Really? Does anyone have the same thing? Nope So..does she know about this? She? You mean Kazuha? I have never mentioned to her but she seems to know about it It's because.. The magazine report? Right..a very popular magazine in Kansai area.. The reporter interviewed Heiji about his first love He met a girl a little bit older than him when he was in the 3rd year And he showed something very important to that girl and we shot pictures too What is this? An ordinary crystal ball I think the girl gave him this So you and that girl.. I don't know her And Heiji seems to have met her only once He visits her whenever he comes to Kyoto Ah..that's why he holds the ball in the picture He wants to show to that girl through the report He's pretty wicked And there's a picture of him in his childhood Wow..so cute Right..Heiji at this time. Ran..this is not important Don't care too much about it Even if he has a first lover That's the past I think your relationship is very stable But for men.. first love is very special Sonako Don't talk about this anymore By the way..Would you like to drink some adzuki bean soup? Madam..3 bowls Please serve them quickly This is the west gate of Kuramadera Usually we have to go from Renwan Gate But it's faster to go from here (Kuramadera Temple) ( Altitude: 588 meters) This is Sango Fudoudone Uniwakamaru met sky-dog and learned swordcraft from him This is a good place for practicing swordcraft But this tree is really tall Heiji..this is.. Get down Don't run Hey..Kudou This guy is like Uniwakamaru Damn Kudou..catch it Gotta go He's coming right after us How can he make it? (Kuramadera Temple) (Kuramadera Station) Please get on the train now The train will leave right away No..you don't have to rush Hey..this is the rail I will be distracted Don't talk to me Violation of traffic law You'll get your license suspended What does he want? Damn We can almost make it That should be the one who killed Genzihotaru's members I think so But I don't know why he wants to kill you It's so strange..Heiji Why are you here? I bumped into Ku.. No..this kid We wanted to solve the puzzle And how about it now? Not yet It's pretty hard By the way.. has the uncle solved it? Eh.. I really miss her The dangling ribbon.. Good job..Ms. Tika Suzu The first in Japan Thanks..for your compliment Come..pour wine for Master Mouri Yes Please.. Kogorou is so delighted So don't come back anymore Why are you here? The master told us The master told you to come? So do you wanna come along? I'm sorry for the bother It's strange.. You are from Miyagawatyou.. Yes..I am Tika Suzu Thanks for the help Do you know each other, Heiji? Ah..I think so Come on.. You get out of the line again Ran..don't blame him We invited him to come Right Let's ask the famous detective to analyze Genzihotaru's case They say all of their members have a Yoshitune Book I have one That is a good book Right..2-hand book dealer Yes But I don't like it very much Its name is Yoshitune Book.. But in fact..it's a biography of Benkei's admirable deeds I like it very much Especially the ''Secure Residence'' What does that mean? It's the name of a Noh play In order to escape the pursuit Yoshitune and his servants disguised themselves as monks and planned to pass the checkpoint at the secure residence When Yoshitune was almost discovered Benkei used his King-kong stick to hit Yoshitune Why? In order to deceive the guards No one will ever believe a servant will hit his master And then Yoshitune passed the checkpoint When Benkei asked for pardon with tears Yoshitune complimented him for his quick wits You can see the strong tie in their relationship It has become a famous story I'm sorry.. I don't have enough sleep here Can I take a rest here? There's no other guest tonight You can go to the next room No..I prefer the rooms downstairs So..please wake me up at 9 o'clock Please enjoy now Wow..I can see the river That is Kamogawa River The cherry blossoms are so beautiful Yeah.. Ran..come over It's not bad for valentines to sit by the river But it's even better to appreciate the blossoms across from Misogigawa Yeah..so beautiful Ayah..I can't believe it It's like white fish I wanna eat it Are you wounded? Yes..a little bit Let Kogorou heal you Don't go overboard You just don't get it Hey..look over there Captain Ayanokouzi What is he doing over there? You can appreciate blossoms on that platform After the clouds go away we can see the moon Let's check it out Mmm..alright I'll stay here So will I Why? Are you interested in that dancer? Idiot..don't say that I lost That guy is crazy He's always like that Tika Suzu.. One more time..one more time I wanna go to the toilet That's alright I'm not drunk You stay with Master Mouri Yes Alright..it's my turn Oh..the moon is coming out Moon? What's wrong? Nothing It reminds me of my appointment with Ran It was 2 hours later when I remembered it That's incredible I thought she's left But I still went to that place Who is it? I'm sorry..Ran I forgot about the appointment Great I've been worrying about you It was that time.. You found she wasn't just your childhood friend Idiot That's not true I have been.. Now she's still waiting for me Ran..what's wrong with you? Nothing Heiji that guy.. I'm really pissed But..Kazuha I envy you Because you can see each other anytime you want Ran That's right It's not easy for me to see Makoto There are too many troubles for girls Come on now Compared with us Your father is really energetic Ayah Mr. Sakura It's 9 o'clock now Mr. Sakura I'm sorry for the bother It's so strange.. Where is he? Is he.. Mr. Sakura Strange? What's going on with the scream? Help What's wrong? Mr. Sakura.. Mr. Sakura Don't let anyone come in Ran..call the police Alright The neck artery is cut with a sharp knife It's like done by a pro Maybe along with a series of cases they are done by the same person Classmate? No wonder you look familiar You are the student detective Hattori Heiji Right Before the police comes Please stay in your room and don't come outside I now I think Mr. Sakura was killed while he was looking for something What was he looking for? The button on this shirt was torn down The criminal couldn't wait to take the clothes off But the wallet full of cash wasn't stolen So it wasn't about money Don't touch the corpse How many times should I repeat? It hurts Coming I am a police detective in Kyoto Ayanokouzi Thank you for coming Please come in Stay outside Yes Isn't this the detective? You are so fast You don't bring your squirrel? I don't bring it out everyday What do you think about this case? It's not impossible for outsiders to do it But the door makes noise when it's opened And the madam should've heard it So it's more likely.. the murder knew Mr. Sakura would be in the warehouse That's to say.. Mr. Sakura's friends.. Saizyou, Ryuen, and Mizuo are more likely to be the suspects They went to the toilet respectively after Mr. Sakura and Ran went out And the stair to the basement is next to the toilet So they could pretend going to the toilet and kill Mr. Sakura in the basement But I'm confused with one thing Ms. Tika Suzu going with Mr. Mizuo to the toilet It's common for dancers to do that But she didn't go with Mr. Ryuen and Saizyou That's because she was playing with the uncle So we can say.. The murder went to the toilet at this time We can presume the murder is either Mr. Ryuen or Saizyou And Mr. Mizuo is innocent If Ms. Tika Suzu isn't the accomplice That's right.. so..let's go now You can't pretend You took that away for the investigation You mean this? I remember his shop is located on Shitin Road (Sakura Antique Shop) Yoshitune Book Ise no Saburou Hattori What? Mr. Sakura is Ise no Saburou What is this? This.. The copy of this map What's going on? Mr. Sakura's map shows.. He mailed the letter to the temple But for what? What? Sakura is Ise no Saburou? Yes..he's the member of Genzihatoru Wait..so the victims are.. Am I the next one for I have ''5'' in my name That happened long ago Since Sakura's map is just a duplicate That means Sakura has the original with him And the murderer took it away I see The killer didn't know Sakura has a copy Who will he be? I think Mr. Ryuen, Saizyou and Mr. Mizuo are the suspects One of them.. But they are not armed Because we've checked their bodies after you left No one will be so stupid that he brings the weapon with him He should've dumped it or hid it We haven't found anything in the shop What about Misogigawa River Is it thrown out of the window in the basement? Right..I think so Sonako heard some noise from the river Really? That's right But the police found nothing in the search It's really strange So there are accomplices I think someone has picked up the weapon I don't think so Why no? Conan It's full moon tonight It's very bright tonight If there's any fissures.. we can see under If there are accomplices Ran should have discovered that Right I know the truth The murder is from the outside Before Ran came to the platform He sneaked into from the basement window and hid himself in the toilet He killed Mr. Sakura when he looked for something And then escaped from the window We didn't see anyone suspicious There are no eye-witnesses This is just a coincidence This is just a co-incidence And the murderer is just lucky I think it's not true We met that guy on Kuramadera Mountain Kazuha..hold tight What? Stay here..you see Heiji Wanna challenge me? Fine What? There are weaknesses everywhere Does he wear any wrist protection pad? Are you the one who killed Mr. Sakura? If so.. I'll treat you like how you treat him This is not what you want The sight gets blurry Mr. police Here.. Heiji..are you okay? Kazuha..how about the police? That's not real Where did you learn this? What a terrible woman Heiji (Mayshirou Hospital) Heiji..are you awake? Heiji.. Great I'm so worried about you Heiji Mr. Ootaki And..who is this? I am Shiratori from the Police Department I heard Sakura used to be a member of Genzihotaru So I came immediately Is it painful? It is.. We have found the stolen artifacts in Sakura's shop Are you awake? Mr. Police How about that knife? I'll ask someone to test it Please inform me when the result comes out If there's no enough evidence You can take samples from my wound on the shoulder Eh? What evidence? The knife was used to kill Mr. Sakura It's better if we can find anything the murder touched What about the motorcycle? Isn't there a motorcycle? That is a stolen one Can you find the evidence? By the way.. Do you have any ideas? This was found in Yoshitune Book in Sakura's place You have no ideas? Forget about it After this incident you'd better be careful next time So..I gotta go Take care.. I'll call my father I'll ask the doctor for you Conan is with me Ran..I gotta go out Please take care of Heiji Are you not gonna stay in the hospital? I'll be alright But that guy is really weird I have never seen the swordcraft style Maybe he has added iron bars to the protection pad I meant to match the weapon with the wound That's why I made him hurt me with the knife But he didn't take away the knife Why not? Not only that.. When we fought..that guy wanted to pick the bag I dropped I don't get it Is that masked guy your first lover? Bingo How is this possible? (Mizuo's Residence) You were attacked afterwards? That's why I wanna know if Mr. Mizuo has an alibi? Because the murderer wore a Noh-play mask A Noh-play mask Can I ask Mr. Saizyou and Ryuen? if they have the alibi? We too? Come on We meant to discuss on the case with Ms. Tika Suzu Right? That's alright After I left the tea house I headed home directly But I'm single So there's a distance between my mom's room and mine I can't prove if I were at home at that time Neither can I Because I live on the 2nd floor of the shop at Shiting Road I chanted at the hall and went back to my room No one can prove for me I see.. I have another question Do you practice shooting arrows? Arrows? Nope I used to do it on the Noh-play stage I tried to imitate shooting the devil with arrows So no one in the tea house was able to use arrows I remember ..Yamakura Mrs. Yamakura practices shooting arrows? But she wasn't there Ah..sorry Sorry for the bother Ah..she's coming Strange What? Come in.. Sister.. You must be Ms. Tika Suzu Yes..I am You must be surprised at my look Yes..please come in Thanks Thanks for your help Please come again You are welcome Thanks..goodbye Sannouzi Temple is on Rokakku Road This is Ichan Road Marutakeebisuni Oshioike Sister Rokakku So it's the 6th road Marutakeebisuni Oshioike What was that? Eh..we call it a ball song It's made up with all the avenues in Kyoto Marutakeebisuni Oshioike Sister Rokakku Takonishiki Shiayabttakamatu Wan five units Snow shoes Ding-ding-dong-dong Passing through the 6th and the 7th..and the 8th You'll get to Township Avenue And then you'll see the 9th avenue All the kids in Kyoto remembers road names this way So you are from Kyoto too? I am.. How old are you? 19? This is Oshioike Road I gotta go Goodbye Goodbye You think she is.. I can't make any mistake She's from Kyoto and she's 2 years older than me But all the kids in Kyoto are familiar with the song Finally I can see her Finally Hey Heiji..what are you doing? How can you get out of the hospital without permission? Ah..Mr. Ootaki Forget it.. Let's not talk about this The test result is out Sakura's blood is detected on the knife And the wound cut matches the knife's blade Really? You'd better listen to me Don't do anything stupid If anything happens to you how am I gonna.. I see Thank you.. Mr. Ootaki So we can say..the man with the mask attacked me and also killed Mr. Sakura And those 4 guys unable to get rid of the weapons are not the suspects anymore? Conan..what are you doing here? Why are you here? Because we've answered Dr. Agasa's question.. But Genta.. He's lost If we call him he is not able.. We have contacted him But he can't read Chinese words So he can't tell us where he is now We want to look for him with your glasses Ok..count on me Hey This is interesting.. It's over there Come on.. There's a murder case here Yes.. I'll explain to you later Come on Ai..give me the drug What is that? The drug controlling the growling of the stomach The doctor invented it for wedding banquets And those who can't drink wine at all Also..there are drugs giving you symptoms of colds Ai assisted in the invention None is useful Oh..here He's in Rokakku Hall Great Great Mom I found Genta I'm saved Great..Genta I thought I can't see you anymore I did too But this is very convenient A badge communicator Yes.. The signal is sent from that device This and the glasses use the same frequency Heiji Now I see What's going on? Kudou..is it possible.. It can't be wrong Ah..what that sister heard was the noise of dumping the weapon Now we can say.. the killer is among the 4 No..among the 3 My first lover can't be the killer Hey It's strange There's something different from what I heard before My first lover sang ''Bride Rokakku'' instead of ''Sister Rokakku'' How come? How do I know that? I have found the broken pieces of the glasses Captain Why do you sigh? What is this? These were worn on those victims One, wearing a hat one, scarf and the other, gloves All the color, pattern, and clothes are the same You don't feel anything strange It's strange Eh..why? If reasonable for one person to wear the 3 at the same time If Mekurashi wears this hat And I wear this scarf and you wear the gloves Don't you think it's strange? Indeed It feels like Shiratori is dead and we share his belongings That's it Eh..what's going on? I'm hungry Be patient Ms. Taki Suzu's mom was an actress Miyagawatyou She died when she was five She wasn't married So Yamakura Tae brought her up She wasn't married Eh.. She bore the baby without getting married She didn't know who the father was.. but every month someone mailed her some money But 3 months ago the support was interrupted It sounds strange The money wasn't sent 3 months ago But how do you know this? Captain Royal told you? Nope Don't look down on me I'm quiet famous here This is nothing at all Everyone says he's my rival But I'm not the kind of person who carries a squirrel everyday Squirrel? Yes..he put it in the pocket But he doesn't take it to the murder scene Squirrel.. Yes..I am Shiratori I am Mekurashi As to Yoshitune and Benkei we've come up with one idea Sharing the leftovers? If we put it that way we can solve the puzzle? That's to say.. one of them may have died I see Mr. Mouri You know who the murder is now? Yes Let me tell you The murder is.. Ms. Taki Suzu.. You are the one How is this possible? This is nonsense He's alright Anyway.. let him finish his analysis You want to take revenge for your father And your father was Yoshitune the leader of the gang But his men betrayed him and killed him 3 months ago That's why he stopped mailing the money I see and you have an accomplice That is Benkei Benkei? As to that person.. Captain Royal..it's you Ms. Taki Suzu You brought something to the tea house That is the knife and the captain's squirrel Wow..so cute This is the key to the trap Ms. Taki Suzu You pretended to go to the toilet during the banquet And killed Mr. Sakura in the warehouse And tied the knife to that man You left it go through the basement window The squirrel jumped into Seage River And then was picked up by the captain down the stream After that..the knife was used to hurt Heiji So the noise was caused by the squirrel You are also involved in the other murder cases Mr. Captain.. Can you use arrows? How can I use it? Are you sure? But Ms. Taki Suzu The arrow shooters usually have a wound here Indeed My ''yanomakura'' is wounded too But I just learned and I couldn't hurt anyone I think so My friends told me only the beginners hurt that part And if you get killed how can you share the leftovers Mr. Mouri You think she's the killer? No..I mean You must be kidding The dancers have to perform shows and greet guests I don't have time to do it Uncle What's up? As to that squirrel It's so small I think it can't move the knife You are very nagging Then I'll prove to you Do it now..Squirrel I can't stand it You intend to ignore me so as to get out of the guilt Stop It's pitiful..sir You are teasing the animal You'd better shut up Genta..go save the squirrel Oh Kudou Ah..thanks to the uncle I know who the murderer is So do I Only the arrow shooters will say that We just have to find out the proof and.. the Buddha statue You are so poor..squirrel Let's feed them I have nuts It's like the song ''Nuts, rolling and rolling'' Nuts, rolling and rolling? Maybe.. Hey..what's wrong with you Kudou? Maybe the duplicated map refers to the roads in Tokyo What are you talking about? Firstly..it's an east-west road And on the 5th layer there are 5 roads The 4th layer there are 4 roads And in between the 2nd the 3rd layer There is Oshioike road The proof is.. Nuts, rolling and rolling? And then the south-north roads.. There's a song referring to violets So this means Shichuan Road The sky-dog comes form Kara-sky-god So it means Karasuma Road And there's ''fu'' on ''Fuji Mountain'' So it means Fu-shao Road What about the chicken? Loach has something to do with Laochan Pot So this means Laoma Road And the chicken Does that mean.. Shitonyan Road Because it means west It's so hard What does this mean? There's a kind of cricket called Yo-cricket And the sky-god refers to Karasuma Road The gold fish has something to do with wheat powder So it means Fuwutin Road And then the violet and Fuji have the same color Connect the chicken, cricket, gold fish, and sky-god Wang (Chinese character) How come? This is the point I think so.. Tama can be read as ''Gyoku'' It means diamonds This place is.. Bukkouzi Temple We've found the treasure What's wrong with you? Nothing.. I feel dizzy I'm sorry How do you feel now? Ah..better Hatori..you broke into Sannouzi Temple 8 years ago How do you know that? Idiot I discovered that from your look of appreciating the blossoms And there was a window frame next to it Right I found the crystal ball under that tree I don't mean to hurt your feelings But wasn't it dropped by your first lover? What are you saying? It should be the hair on the stolen statue? Hair? You mean the splendid hair on the statue? Right Sometimes they use crystal balls to replace the hair It's used in Noh play too This is my analysis Genzihatoru sneaked into Sannouzi 8 years ago and stole the statue But during the delivery the hair dropped And the leader, Yoshitune found this.. and sent someone to look for it At that time.. I wanna drink adzuki soup I'd like mixed ice The leader had no choice but to put the statue is Sakura's shop 8 years later.. the criminal found you were the one he knew 8 years ago That magazine? At this time.. someone happened inside the gang I think their leader is seriously ill or something Knowing he's not able to make it He hid the statue in a different place And drew the map like a puzzle letting the successor solve the puzzle And then he died? His men tried to solve the puzzle but they couldn't get the right answer At this time.. One of the members came to work with the killer I think Sakura saw the killer's swordcraft skills So he asked someone to kill all his men And then they found out the statue and the hair They sold it and split the money I think the antique shop owner Mr. Sakura has found the way to sell the stolen antiques That's why he said it was safe The criminal pretended to cooperate with Sakura In fact.. he planned to kill them all and posses the whole antique But he still had to solve the puzzle So he came up with an idea of asking the famous detective Mouri Kogorou to help him Bukkouzi Temple.. It's right here But is the statue here? Yes.. I don't think so Hey What's wrong with you? Hey..Kudou What have you come up with? This is.. Yuryu Temple Is this the point on the map? Right Kazuha? It's me I have the girl In one hour come to Yuryu temple alone If you dare call the police I'll kill her Heiji..you can't come They will kill you Kazuha Kazuha Hattori Kazuha is kidnapped What? He wants me to meet him at Yuryu temple in one hour Yuryu temple? Great We'll go together now Heiji Ray Bridge (Learning the father's death the son came back to Kyoto) (When the funeral team came to the bridge) (His father woke up) (and talked to his son) Hey.. (Kuramadera Mountain) (Yuryu Temple) This is an instruction of the master The knife will be put in Benkei's drawer And the arrows in Rokaku's Benkei's drawer is.. From the top one, two, three Which are Benkei and Rokaku's? Bukkouzi Temple? I heard them say so Where are they? Kazuha doesn't pick up the phone Yurye Temple I am hungry Really? I'll cook you something later Excuse me Where is Yuryu Temple? Deep in Kuramadera Mountain But it was abandoned long long ago Thanks Kuramadera Mountain Why is he not here yet? Who will be so stupid? really? Maybe he has no guts Heiji You didn't hurt Kazuha? I..I'm fine.. You want this In order to get the crystal ball You attacked me yesterday You failed.. and then you killed Mr. Sakura at the tea house in order to possess the treasure And I know why you began with Sandotin not with Miyagawatyou Because there was a river behind the tea house River After you killed Mr. Sakura You tossed the detector of the security company and the weapon into the bottle And then used mobile phones to check in the security company's webpage You checked the position of the detector and when I was about to go back to Osaka, you attacked me You tried to kill me with a short knife Although your plan failed because of Kazuha's intervention You intended to drop the weapon in order to avoid suspicision You wanted to let us believe the murderer was someone else Am I right.. Mr. Saizyou Taiga No..I should call you.. Misashi pretending Benkei Hattori Heiji is really outstanding How do you know it's me.. Because you tried to lie to us you can't shoot arrows When you kneel down you always pull back your left leg first That's called ''pull half leg'' The arrow shooters all have such a habit When you were asked who practices shooting arrows You mentioned ''yanomakura'' unintentionally I remember ''yamakura''.. You are not talking about Mrs. Yamakura You mean.. ''Yanomakura'' The second section of the left thumb used to hold the arrows I think you wanted to say that.. I remember.. Ms. Tika Suzu hurt her yanomakura Only the professionals use this term By the way.. Mr. Ryuen is an outsiders He can't even pronounce accurately Ryuen and I practice swordcraft at the same place Because of that.. Someday I learned an ancient school called ''Yoshitune School'' and I started to study it I quit the practice 2 years ago and claimed to be the heir of Yoshitune School Benkei is the founder of Yoshitune School Compared with Benkei.. I think I like it more I wanna be a part of it But the title was always taken away The leader of the robbery ring was given the name of Benkei Were you in need of money? Right.. I didn't do it for personal desire I wanted to build a school in Kyoto And the leader was the master of the temple and he administered the temple after it was abandoned That's why I use this place as a practice place 3 months ago..the leader died And the temple has to be dismantled I can't use it anymore I have a question You are just using Mr. Ryuen Right I heard him talk about the statue After I mailed the letter As I have expected he came to talk to me So I advised him to ask Mouri for help Even if I don't count on him I can find a buyer Because it's very easy to do it on the Internet Alright..the chat is over Please hand me the crystal No problem but you have to let Kazuha go No problem If you tell me where the statue is What? Where is the statue? It's in the temple What are you saying? It's called.. people always forget the nearest Don't lie to me I have searched the whole temple I just can't find you I am not lying to you Kazuha..run now Heiji They are my favorite disciples Don't get involved Heiji Stop..this is not Heiji You..who are you? Who are you? I am Kudou Shinichi I am a detective What? What are you talking about? You made him swallow the pill? Because Kudou called and asked if there's any way to restore him even just for a short moment But the anti-poison of APTX 4869 is out The Bakanya that restored him has lost its effects because of the generation of antibodies It occurs to me.. If you take some medicine that gives you symptoms of colds and drink Bakanya Maybe you can restore your body again So..he.. As I have expected the experiment worked Kudou is restored But he's like having a terrible cold He's very weak I can't guarantee he will be safe.. How about Heiji now? I don't know Before the future check-up he has to take a rest I'm assigned to take care of him Kudou.. Damn.. How can he lie to me I wanted to let her escape here first But now I can't make any move Damn.. Bakanya has lost its effect I'll be dead Maybe you can be the best detective but if you'd like to be a warrior You're way to far.. Hattori Heiji Sorry for the waiting..Kazuha You.. You are such a big idiot Why are you here now? Hey, Kudou How dare you steal my clothes And.. I don't know what you apply to your face But I don't have such a dark skin Really? Forget it Let me handle it Go now Hide yourself first And come back again after you're restored Stop right there I am your rival Kazuha Don't tell anyone about seeing Kudou Even that girl Eh? Even Ran? Why? There's no reason They won't meet It's better not to tell her You can't go back alive What the hell is it? Chase him Hey..you find him? Not yet Carry on Eh..what's going on? Hush..don't make any noise Don't move Shinichi You look like before What's wrong with you? Why do you sweat so much? Who are they? Where have they been? I have no choice.. Let's go back first I'm sorry..Ran I can't.. It's locked.. I can't open it Do something This smells like ''Tata-mi'' This is the room where I was imprisoned Get me the axe..quick Damn..they will break in Is there any weapon? What? Why are there so many drawers The knife was put in Benkei's drawer And the arrows in Rokaku's Heiji.. the knife is in Benkei's drawer What? In this drawer? But there are so many I don't know which is his I have seen it before The alignment of the drawers is like the roads in Kyoto I see These are Karasuma Road and Sanyashi Road Wait Do they give each drawer a name? Name? Right Like Rokakku.. is Rokaku's Hall Benkei's drawer.. means Benkei's stone Going east from Santo Fuwutin This is the ball song Marutakeebisuni.. Marutakeebisuni.. and then.. Damn..I can't remember Marutakeebisuni Oshioike Bride Rokakku.. Takonishiki Heiji..Santo is 2 layers above the Takonishiki Alright 2 layers above Takonishiki And the west-east road is.. Temple..Yushin.. Fuwu..Fu.. Fuwutin is the 3rd Right here Die now The unique pattern on both sides This is the evil knife Using it to deal with the devil on Yoshitune is the best idea What are you talking about? Go away What are you doing? Chase him Yes Listen.. I'll delay them You'd better run now NO..I wanna be with you Be good Heiji We have found it Run now Go get that girl Yes Conan Kazuha..how about Heiji? He's over there Heiji Damn I wanna call the police but there's no reception You can use this Hey..go put out the fire Yes Alright.. I hope someone has spotted the fire Hey..Ran Are you awake? Father Where is Shinichi? You fainted? Why is that guy here? Why are you sleeping here? Why are you here then? I informed him Kazuha was kidnapped by Genzihatoru Mr. Mouri It's time for a fight As I wish I won't be trapped again How about this? Knife? This is not an ordinary one There's poison on it What are you saying? If you're cut you'll die immediately What a wicked guy Damn.. Heiji is in danger You have nowhere to run The arrows are aimed at you You have to figure it out Conan Don't run Hey..I am here Look Go..Heiji Heiji You want to be Benkei? If you were Benkei Yoshitune would've been killed at the checkpoint The master is defeated Arrest them Yes Great..Conan Yes.. Didn't you call Heiji by ''Hattori''? I'm sorry..I was too excited It's Heiji Heiji This temple.. Now all the puzzles are solved And the medical effect is only temporary Thanks for letting me gather so much information Are you okay, Heiji? I am fine But where is the statue? Heiji..Shinichi is.. What.. Nothing It was just a dream (Sannouzi Temple) It's really embarrassing I can't find where the statue is Don't blame yourself it's up to the fate Never mind Please be careful Goodbye It's really troublesome now It's only one hour left Don't worry We'll inform the faithfuls The Medicine Buddha The Buddha is back (Yuryu Temple, During the Dawn) We found it..Kudou Am I right? The shape of the temple is like the Chinese character ''Â§'' And the point refers to this clock tower I didn't perceive that either With a "Â§" on top of it it becomes "Â§" which implies the ''roof' I see So now it's returned to the original owner Yes They are the best partners Just like Yoshitune and Benkei You mean Heiji and Mouri? You are not mature enough What do you mean? Alright..Ayumi will be the next Alright So cute I'll take it back No Because it's my best friend Mr. Captain You don't have many friends Sorry for suspecting you to be the criminals That's alright I knew my father I asked him to stop mailing me money Your father? Who is he? This is a secret That nasty monk Marutakeebisuni Oshioike Bride Rokakku Not bride..but sister Idiot Where did you learn this song? I learned it from my relative in Kyoto I remember when I was in the 3rd year We learned it together With me? What? You don't remember? I remember now.. You were so impatient You wanted to go to Sannouzi and then you went out At that time my relative helped me wear Kimono and hair dressings..makeup I went to Sannouzi to look for you Because I couldn't see you I left soon I'd like to show you the scene I saw at that time The blossoms were scattered everywhere Marutakeebisuni Oshioike Bride Rokaku..Takonishiki That means.. Finally I can see you See me? Heiji you saw your first lover? Who is she? The dancer? I won't tell you..idiot It doesn't matter..stingy guy Tell me please Eh.. I'll tell you in another 1 500 years Come on Conan..what are you doing? Why do you sweat so much? Shin..Shinichi By the way.. I called Shinichi I wanted him to disguise himself as Heiji and save Kazuha Right? Yes.. but that guy is really vulnerable He escaped half way Didn't you tell me not to tell anyone? I see So that was Shinichi? Finally I see you If I can see you again I won't let go your hand The flower hall that informs us the end of spring The blurry flower petal The awakening of the song of memory It is still resonated in my mind Time after time the miracle of our encounter In the city that the breezes go through We walk through the slope hand in hand So far I don't forget our promise I hear your voice in the winds which remind me of a remote memory I don't know the terror of the hurt I swear someday I will be here meeting you again When the season of falling leaves comes I'll wear smiles Time after time In the city with petals around me I can't go back to the time they were still on the tree Just like the day.. There's no change I waited with tears The dancing petals Just like caressing the water surface It makes us sad when we cherish it more Some say.. we are lonesome anyway But we can't help looking for our partner We always pursue the fragile things.. Time after time If I can meet you in this colorful city We don't need any promise The vulnerable you.. I will stay by your side I'd like ice cream Alright..it's 300 yens I am the only one who hasn't met the special someone Sonako.. you will see Kyogoku someday I'm not good at waiting So is Ran Come on.. I don't dislike it Because the longer I wait when we meet.. You look like before.. we will feel more delighted Ah..damn
