[DRIVING FUNK MUSIC] [SIRENS] [TIRES SCREECH] [MUSIC FADES] [BUZZER] Mr. Van Clief? Yes. Were you expecting anyone else? No, no. Come this way please. Mr. Yin will be right with you. Have a seat, please. [PIANO MUSIC] Excuse me, the Black Dragon is here. Right. Hello Mr. Van Clief. You're right on time. How are you? Not bad. Are you really interested in my health? - Please sit down. - Right. - Haven't missed yet. - No. Not really. I know you're in fine shape. Let's drop the small talk and get down to it. Or course, Mr. van Clief. But don't you think that $100,000 in cash is a high price? Well I understand it's a little dangerous. Anyway... That's my price. Of course. You're well worth it. Here's the money. And here's the ticket. And this is my card. Thanks. By the way, why do you want to know who did it? Well, let's say he's an old family friend. I'll definitely let you know who did it Jim. Uh-uh. The name is Yin. Oh yes. Yin, Mr. Yin. It was my pleasure. Right. Have a good trip, Mr. Van Clief. Will do. [AIRPLANE ENGINE] [FUNKY MUSIC] Can you help me? Over there. [MUSIC FADES OUT] Excuse me, is Mr. Woodcock here? [LAUGHING] Sorry sir, Woodcock? Mr. Charlie Woodcock. This is antique shop, sir. [CHUCKLES] Woodcock, brother, it's a name. W-O-O-D-C-O-C-K. Oh, Woodcock. Sorry. No sell woodcocks here. Only ivory and jade. [SPEAKING CHINESE] - Oh! Li-Po? - Li-Po. [CHUCKLES] This way sir, this way. [NERVOUS CHUCKLE] [GRUNTING] Hoi! Huah! [GRUNTING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [LAUGHING] [UPTEMPO MUSIC] [DRUMMING INTENSIFIES] [MUSIC STOPS ABRUPTLY] Let's stop now. We'll continue tomorrow. I don't believe it. The autopsy... [INAUDIBLE], it's all very clear. What else do you want? I think there's more. Reports always a way of hiding the truth. Don't argue. If you want the truth, let's find it ourselves. [CHUCKLING] - Tea. - Thank you. - [CHUCKLING] Please. - Thank you. Hey Charlie... This is a pretty far out place you have here. Store, dojo, and this. Well, this is how I like it. Store's a front. The back is for workin' out. And this is for taking it easy. It looks like you picked up some kung-fu. Yeah. After Vietnam, I stayed here. And developed my own style. Hmm. I see you're now Li-Po. Anyway... when in China, do as the Chinese do. Besides, Li-Po's good for business. Japanese don't buy antiques from Americans. Well I'm not Japanese, and I'm not here for jade. After Bruce's death, I knew you'd be coming. Hmm. We've got time to talk about it. I see you're into antiques now. Nah, Ron. You know this is all a front. This? It's only junk. Oh I don't know. This looks like a nice piece. Oh yes. That one? That's over two thousand years old. It's the most valuable piece in the whole place. Can't find another one like it anywhere. Beautiful. Where did you get this? I got it during a special mission in mainland China. [GONG CRASH] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING CONTINUES] Over here, young fighter. - Yes master? - Break it. But master, it's so small. How can I do it? It's not your power I'm testing, but, it's you skill. [CHANTING MUSIC] Show me your hand. Hmm. Now you hold it it. I don't believe it. If I didn't see it with my own eyes. The summer insect will never see the winter's snow. The frog in the well would never know the vastness of the sky. He who has seen little admires much. [DRAMATIC FLOURISH] There seems to be a lot of talk about his death. And everyone seems to have his own story. Man, look at his face. It doesn't even seem like the same person. Yeah, he looked like he went through some changes. He sure did. I think we better go to the house where he died. Hey. What do you want? We want to see Miss Tang. - Who are you? - Friends of Bruce. She is not here. You can't come in. Okay my man. We'll come back later. Damn. [SPEAKING CHINESE] [UPTEMPO MUSIC] I can see we're not gonna get anything out of that guy. Nah. The Chinese... they don't believe in talking. - Yeah, I know what you mean. - Mmm-hmm. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [WHISTLES] [SCREAMS] [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Get up! - Who put you up to this? - Please, let me go. Just trying to make a living. Ah, don't waste our time with these punks. It looked like a local hood to me. Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOORBELL BUZZING] - Cops coming.? - Let's go. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Rickshaw, rickshaw! Hey, you want a rickshaw, yeah? Sure. Sure, how much is it to Peking street? - Two American dollars. - Too much. No, very cheap, very cheap. - One dollar. - One dollar? - Okay, okay. - Well what are you waiting for? Get in. Me sit in rickshaw? You pull me? That's right. Get in, Jim. Uh, please. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Hey [INAUDIBLE], it's exercise time. Let's do some lasp. - Sure, it's alright with me, you're pulling the weight. - Right on. [FIGHTING SOUNDS] [FIGHTING] Let's go. Let's go now. [LAUGHING] [UPBEAT MUSIC] [LAUGHING] - That's one ride he won't forget. - Yeah. [LAUGHING] [CHUCKLING] Uh, hey, you wanna buy something? [CHUCKLING] I brought these two guys here. You give me my 20 percent. - Crazy. - Huh? - That man's my boss here. - Huh. He's my rickshaw puller. Crazy... [SPEAKING MANDARIN] Hmmpf! Phew! I think we should see that actress. Maybe she knows something. No use in that Ron. She's under heavy protection. Hmm... Then let's go back to her house. I don't like the way we were jumped anyway. Master. Yes, young tiger? Master. Suppose I were to kill those who are evil... Would that help the good? You are here to teach what you have learned. Not to kill people off. When the leaders are good. Then the people will be good also. You see, my son... The essence of the leaders is that of wind. The essence of people is that of grass. When the wind blows, the grass has no choice but bend. Thank you master. Very smart. That's all you can say? [SPEAKING MANDARIN] What they doing there? That you don't know. Do you? Because you weren't there. I thought it was easy. I didn't know. That one man could handle all of our men. The black man, he was good. In a cat stance he managed to hit me. With a monkey fist, boss. - Hmm. He's good, boss. - One man. How good can he be? Beyond the high mountain. There are even higher mountains yet. Hey boss, according to rickshaw puller - the american is the boss of Li-Po antiques. - Huh? Li-Po antiques? [LAUGHING] [ETHEREAL MUSIC] [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [CLATTERING] Shh! [GRUNTING] [FIGHTING] [DRAMATIC CHORD] [FIGHTING] [MUSIC] ]MUSIC FADES] I can't figure this out. What where those guys doing there? I don't know, but they can handle themselves pretty good. Come in. Oh, hello Mao. Very good boss. Very expensive. Oh good, just lay it on the table Mao. Thank you. I haven't got time for that now. - This rock costs money? - Oh yeah. It's good quality jade. Federal's got time to look in jade now. [CHUCKLING] Fix appointment with Miss Cam. At the opera house. Okay? Good. Who's Cam? She knows the girl in whose house Bruce died. Let's see her as soon as possible. Here we are. [FAINT MUSIC PLAYING] Please come this way. This way, please. Take a seat. Thank you. Please, please. Ah. Ah. [CHUCKLING] We're waiting for Miss Cam. - Shoe polish? - No... Special Chinese makeup. This makeup? No baby, it's the real shit. [CHUCKLING] Mr. Van Clief from America. Mr. Li-Po. - Hello. How do you do? - Miss Cam. - Hello. - Hello Miss Cam. As you know Miss Cam, I'm trying to find out who killed Bruce. I'm sorry, but I can't help. [FLUTE MUSIC] You understand [INAUDIBLE]. [MUSIC FADES] Battle wounds can be cured. Fate: Incurable. The man has already died. To investigate his death you must first check the motive. But master, Brother Bruce was a great kung-fu man. Why should he take drugs to keep physically fit? That is not fact. Only rumor. People say he die of over-sex. [CHUCKLING] Only a fool can make such a statement. Eating and mating are men's nature. So I must find out the truth about his death. Miss Cam, do you know of any organizations who wanted him dead? No. I don't know. I'd like to talk to Miss Tang. Can you tell me where I can find her? No. I don't know where she is. On stage Miss Cam. Yes, coming. I think you might as well see my cousin. He's a reporter, and he's written long stories about death. But the newspaper refuse to print it. What does he know about this matter? He has been a reporter for a long time. He's very well informed. This is his telephone number. Just mention my name. But about Miss Tang... I'm very sorry. Thank you. [UPBEAT MUSIC] Enough dealers. In order to expand the business I've been trying to incorporate Bruce into syndicate. But... he repeatedly turned them down. The Hong Kong drug king tried every method to get Bruce to work with him. They offered him everything money could buy. When he refused... they threatened to kill him. But the report says there's drugs in his body. So what's the twist? Unfortunately I'm alone, and they gave me warning. Silence or six feet under. - So tell us a twist. - Okay. When they could not buy him, they used the extra [INAUDIBLE] to kill him. Then, they left traces of drugs to be found in his body. They did it in order to convince young people that their idol was a drug user. And that's how he maintained his superb form. It sounds like an unbelievable plot. However its true. Since the amount of drug was not enough to kill a mouse. Let alone Bruce. - DIdn't tell me who they are. - I told you enough. After all. Silence or six feet under. They leave me no choice. Have you checked their background? We're checking it now. We must know them well. In order to kill them. [OMINOUS MUSIC] What time is it, Ron? He's late. Well, we'll wait a little while longer anyway. - How do you like Chinese women? - They'll do. Okay, I can dig it. - Hello. Are you Mr. Wo- - Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes! - How are you Mr. Van Clief? - Hello. No, I am Mr. Li-Po. This is Mr. Van Clief. Oh, oh, how are you Mr. Van Clief? I'm Wong Ping. I'm Wong Ping the reporter. Uh, my cousin says you're looking for me? Ah. We understand you have some information for us. Well... this is not the right place. Let's take my car and go somewhere quiet. - Sure, why not? - Great. - Okay. This way. - Okay. - Bruce used to practice here also. - Oh really? In the old days in China the great Kung Fu men, they all practice in the mountains. I see. [OMINOUS MUSIC] Who's that? Huh? Oh, they're here to practice also. What? Careful now. Can't take chances. Hmm. [SCREAMING, FIGHTING] [YELLING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] Li-Po! - Alright, enough of this bullshit! Where's that reporter? - Let me go, please! L-l-let me... Damn! That opera bitch is working with them too. [INAUDIBLE] maybe great wisdom. Cleverness can only lead to one destruction. That reporter had an unbelievable story to tell. [INAUDIBLE] to be true. [DISTANT FIGHTING] [INAUDIBLE] gave himself up this morning. Claiming he killed Bruce. Accidentally with his iron fist. Give five hundred dollars and they can release. For being a public nuisance. Huh. Let's go and check on him. There's nothing to lose. [GRUNTING] [YELLING] Heh. Excuse me. Would you show me the punch which killed Bruce? [CHUCKLING] The iron fist. Would you use it on me? I would consider it an honor to die from it. Huh. [DEEP BREATH] [YELLING] So that's a punch that can kill people. Of course. It broke the brick. What do you think? Hmm. Yeah, but that's only a brick. You think you can try it on a human being? If you can, you can try it on me. Hmm. I killed one already. - Don't kill no more. - Hmm! If you've the guts, you come on over. I'm gonna slap you. Hmm! Good! You asked for it! [GRUNTING] [YELLING] And you say you killed Bruce? [CHUCKLING] Damn. We were just with him and he pulled a disappearing act. Impossible. He was killed this morning! If that's true, then the opera girl wasn't involved. This way. Excuse me, is this Mr. Wong Ping's house? Who are you? And what do you want? We're his friends. This is Mr. Van Clief and Mr. Li-Po. Wong Ping is already dead. And no one can go in except for his family. [LOW MUSIC] My cousin was killed. What time was he killed? The police found his body this morning. And his camera is missing. Who was that other creep? He must've killed him. I don't know, but this is some crazy shit. [LAUGHING] Chicago sure is a good photographer. He sure is, with so many girls. He has to be, right? Girls like photos. So to be a master photographer in order to get them. [LAUGHING] I hire you to kill men, instead you become a lady killer. Uh, this time, I won't miss. I want you to get them. One by one. Follow them. And then kill them. Right. Kill them. Don't take too much time. If you want men, you'll get men. If you want weapons you'll get weapons. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GRUNTING] [YELLING] [SNAPS FINGERS] [FIGHTING] [WHEEZING] [MOANING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [SIGHS] Two dead. And we know as much as when we stated. A few days ago, came a black man from the states. Tried to investigate his death. A black man? Li-Po's antique shop keeper Little Mao brought them. They tried to get Miss Tang's address. Hmm. He must be the same one that we have fought. That must be the famous Black Dragon from America. [SIGHS] He must be investigating the same thing that we are doing. You're right. - Well let's consult the master first. - Yeah. I've been informed. About the matter. As you know... we cannot bring back the dead. [BOTH] Yes, master. To follow the course of Bruce's death... this is the duty of all Kung Fu people. Now the Black Dragon is here. He is a mythical man. His martial art is great. A top man from the West. And of course, four times world champion. He's the head instructor of 20 Black Dragon schools. An honorable young master. Now that he's here... [INAUDIBLE] receive much attention. But master... can't we cooperate with him? With his status? The Black Dragon will probably work alone. Let's see how things develop. Before we get involved in it. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] Some mail for you, Mr. Yen. [VAN CLIEF] Report #1. Dear Mr. Yen... The first week of investigation has proved fruitless. The attitudes here are extremely negative. So far, I have met great resistance disguised as robbers and newspaper reporters. Which at leasts indicated that I'm on the right track. It shouldn't be too long before I flush them out. Yours truly, Ron Van Clief, the Black Dragon. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [HUMMING] [CHUCKLING] Oh, good morning. What can I do for you? Ah... ah? Hmm. What's the price of this? Oh this? The best jade! Best workmanship. Ah! L-l-let go of me! Will you let go! what's this? Be quiet. The boss wants to see you. Come along with us. And appraise some jade. No! Let go of me! Ah! [KNOCKING] Hey what you want? We have an appointment with Miss Lina Tang. Here's my card. Be a minute, please. - Please come in. - Thank you. - Good afternoon Miss Tang. - How are you, Miss Tang? This is Mr. Van Clief from the United States. Good afternoon gentlemen. Please have a seat. [BOTH] Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry to bother you... but I have some questions about Bruce's death. I don't know anything. And I think it's better to forget about it. I can't forget it Miss Tang. He was a friend of mine. A lot of people are interested in this matter. Anything you could tell us would certainly help. The truth is he died of an allergy, as the doctor reported. And I've nothing to say. I have told you everything there is to tell. You were one of his best friends. We know you know the truth. I think you better leave as soon as possible. - Otherwise... - Otherwise what? Otherwise, nothing. Nothing at all. Hmm. Okay... Do you know if he fought with anyone before he died? No, no. I mean I don't know! Do you know why it was reported that he died in a hospital Instead of a house? I don't know! He was a drug addict, wasn't he? No, he wasn't. I really don't know. If he wasn't a drug addict... was he allergic to any drugs? Do you know? I don't know! I said I don't know! Will you please leave me alone? Is that all you can say? "I don't know"? I have nothing to say. And there's just nothing to find out. Let's go. I don't think she wants to cooperate. Please leave me alone. Please leave me alone. I'm sorry, but you have to go. [SOBBING] Let's go. I think she'll talk. - Sooner or later. - Okay. [GASPING] [CHUCKLING] [OMINOUS MUSIC] - Uh, where's your boss? - He's coming. Why do you have my boss picture here? [CHUCKLING] [LAUGHING] Is he your boss? Mm. What's your name? Me? I'm Mao. And you? What's your name? You look at jade? I'll look at jade. Hmm! [CHUCKLING] Look at these pictures on the wall. Do you recognize anyone? [CHUCKLING] Of course! There's my boss over there. Which one? Show me. Now here's my boss. [CHUCKLING] Do you know why they are interested in Bruce's death? I don't know. Why should I? [CHUCKLING SOFTLY] Are you sure you don't? I really don't know. It's my boss' business, why should I care? Or is it that you don't want to tell me? I really don't know. If you ask me about jade, then I can tell you. Hi! Hey, you gonna ask me about jade? [OMINOUS MUSIC] [NERVOUS BREATHING] Why did you hit me? ÷{GRUNTING] Why he hit you? Don't you know? I really don't know anything. I... ah, ah... If you cooperate... Then he won't hit you. I... I... I... [GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] [CRYING IN PAIN] [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Hmm. Mao? Mao? He's not back here. Wonder where he is. That's strange. He's never left the place alone like this before. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? What? Thanks. Hello? I'm Li-Po. What? He's dead. - Who's dead? - Mao. Mao's dead. [DRAMATIC FLOURISH] Hold it! I am Li-Po from the antique shop. May I see the body? - Why? - I understand it's the boy that works for me. How do you know? I received a phone call, I thought it was the police. We haven't done that yet. I think you'd better follow us to the police station. - But take a look anyway. - Okay, thank you. It's Mao. What happened? We don't know yet. Looks like he drowned. [OMINOUS MUSIC] Drowned? My ass! Look at his eyes I think you better go back Ron. I'll take care of this and go down to the police station. - Okay. Call me if you need anything. - Right on, brother. [WHOOSHING] [LAUGHING] Hey... Come on... What is this? [LAUGHING] Look. What's he up to now? Just monkeying around. [LAUGHING] Look, the monkey's angry. So what if he is? If he's got the guts, I'll take him on. [LAUGHING] What do you want? You're all by yourself. Let's keep you company. [GRUNTING] [OMINOUS MUSIC] [MOANING] [GIGGLING] [LAUGHING] I pray that our brothers in heaven will help us find the murderer soon. [SOFTLY SOBBING] [OMINOUS MUSIC] [YELLING] [FIGHTING] [OMINOUS MUSIC] [BLOWS LANDING] [LAUGHING] [BLOWS LANDING] [KNOCKING] [KNOCKING] You know Mr. Li-Po? - Yes. - He's dead. - Dead? - Yes. This morning. Charlie Pantera? Dead? - How? - Very strange. We don't know yet. Where's his body? In the hospital. Will you come with us to identify the body? Yeah. Let me get dressed. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [FIGHTING] [FUNKY MUSIC] [FIGHTING] [LAUGHING] [GRUNTING] Hmm! Get him! [YELLING] Thank you very much. Who was he? I'm alright. Let's fix this up first. I'll tell you on the way. How do you feel now? Better. Much better. Thank you. It's alright. We're all brothers. - You should feel better by tomorrow. - Right. How 'bout it? Can I put crosses on these pictures? Can you give me a reply? Can you give me an idea? Any idea at all? - If only we had guns. - Guns? Are you crazy? There are 10 million ears in Hong Kiong and you want them to hear us? Are you going crazy? [GRUNTING] Hmm! Hey relax... This way. Ah... [CHUCKLING] Welcome Miss Tang. Sit down. Why did you bring me here? Just a very small matter. Sorry to have troubled you. What more do you want? Two questions. How did Bruce die? And... what's the Black Dragon doing here? Are you still pretending? [CHUCKLES] The other day... t-two men, came over to visit you. One white, and one black. The white man, we know, [CHUCKLES] was an undercover agent. He died accidentally. [CHUCKLES] Now this is the other guy. He's from, from Bruce's school. The Black Dragon. I'll take care of him personally. Up 'til know you've hired children to fight them. Now get some kung fu men. I'll pay any price. And that means no escape. Uh, no, no good. - Try those. - Alright. Okay. [GRUNTING] [SHOUTING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [ALL EXCLAIMING] Master, master... Miss Tang has agreed to meet us. I think she wants to talk. Good. - Renny, let's go together. - Sure. Be very cautious. [BOTH] Yes, master. [DOORBELL BUZZING] It's not locked. Let's try it. Hmm... Hmm. Miss Tang? [DRAMATIC MUSIC] She's been drugged. Someone sure did. [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] You flatter me. So you're them an behind all these punks. It's about time you showed your face. I didn't know you were interested in my face. But I am, you jive turkey. Hmm! [GRUNTING] [BAT CLATTERS] [YELLING] [GRUNTING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Fucking bitch! [STRUGGLING] [GRUNTING] [YELLING] Ahh! [YELLING] [WHOOSHING] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [CRASHING GONG] You did a good job, Mr. Van Clief. What took you so long, Jim? I've been waiting for you. I'm here now. Can you tell me who did it? Hmm. I don't think it's necessary. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [GRUNTING] [GASPING] [SCREAMING] [MUSIC INTENSIFIES] [GRUNTING] [YELLING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GRUNTING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] Ahh! [SCREAMING] [CRUNCHING, SQUISHING] [GURGLING] Master... All that I've told you, and all that you know... What is the real reason for Bruce's death? You ask a difficult question, my son. That I can only answer you the words of my teacher and his teacher teacher. "In my search for the truth I was told that the sky has unexpected clouds and storms. And men of sudden fortune and misfortune. Nothing depends on mens own dream. His whole life is arranged by fate. [INAUDIBLE] needs no weapon to kill a man. As you know, there's only one way to be born, a hundred to die. On a path of death walks men of all ages. And you find out that the universe is shrewd. By letting things alone." [DRAMATIC MUSIC]
