Somebody is bound to have one. Hey, this is not a lay. I really like you. lguessl like you too. Sebu said you want to be with me. Yeah. But... I might be looking for something else. Like what? You'rethis party chick, which is like cool and all. But I don't see us binge watching Sopranos. 0r going to raves. But you like rave parties. My friends like rave parties. Shut up and kiss me. Hey.

Are you the owner of the property? - Please leave. Are you the... - Fuck off! Hi. I heard that Sebu threw quite a party yesterday? I slept for two hours. Hmm, tell him that I said hi. He's getting stitched up. Stitched up? Surprising. So, what can I get you guys? lwill charge you, even it! leave now. Where's our boy? - He said that he will be back soon. Are you sure you don't want me to clean? Did you have fun yesterday? Yeah, nice that you could make it. You should be careful with me. How come? lhaveloads ofissues. liust don't think about them when I'm drunk. Isn't that the reason to get drunk? No. lthink I should go. Message me when you want a rerun. Fuck. Miku! Miku you drag your ass back home right n-- Can we stop at a gas station? Can we stop at a gas station? This is Minna. So, did you even get laid? I hope you did. It's going to be a dry summer. You know not to play tennis without socks? Oh my god. What got you to remodel our home? Me? - The living room was destroyed. Why did you even come home? Miku? Did one of your friends really die? What? I didn't know you talk to the neighbors. You crazy bitch! Miku! Hi! Did you sleep well? You threw my phone on the freeway. Do you want a soft drink? I promise not to mention what happened. Hi, I came to meet the neighbors. l'm Elias. l'm Minna. - Nice to meet you. So, cottage neighbors. Where have you moved? Bight there. 12 years ago, though. Oh? We're about to light the barbecue. Would you like to ioin us with your family, or? Yes, I'd love to. I'll get my mother. She's in our cabin. Welcome. Thank you. Bye. Jaakko, hey. Wake up. Give me your hand. You're so cute Elias. You must get all girls. I'm sure! would. They're both victims ofliberal parenting. So you're not an only child? My sister is 24 and pretty wild. She's been traveling in the States for awhile now. She's coming back today or tomorrow, or? She would make a nice summer girl for Miku. So, Miku. So what's up with you? What do you mean? How's life? Out in the country side with my parents. Nothing much. So what do you think? Should we go fishing tomorrow? Let's go to the pier bar instead. So tomorrow's a party night, huh? We've been there a few times with my brother. Why there? You can buy beer there. And nobody checks for ID. Sounds fun. Do you want one? Thanks. Have you had this place for a long time? Yeah, I think I was around five when we got it. We've also had our place for quite some time. How come you don't know the bar? We don't need to hide to drink beer. Hey, give me your number. Let's get drunk tomorrow. My phone's broken. Takethis one. If mom calls, it's me. Okay. Thanks. I'll get my mom now. It's been a long day. Miku? Breakfast is ready. Have you got time to eat? Come get some food. What are you doing? l'm preparing for tonight. If the door is shut, it stays shut. The door stays shut. - Yeah, ok. Do you want some eggs? No, Thanks. Daddy's chili-eggs are ready. Let's eat. Wife! Hurry. Hello? - What's up? Nothing much. - Okay. I'm good. Just waking up. Do you want to take a boat trip? - Right now? - No, the day after tomorrow. Yes, right now! - Fuck l'm slow. Yeah, you're not the sharpest knife in the shed. Sure, let's do it. Are you coming to get me? I'll be right there. Hello? Are you asleep? Hi. What took you so long? Hop on. Hi there. Hi. Can I have two beers? Where did you leave Sebu? Sebu is in Africa. Sure heis. Did you come with a boat? No we did not. That would be 14euros. Those are 5 euros each. The 5 euro beers are for adults. You got to be kidding me? You want it or not? Thanks. Thank you. Cheers. - Cin cin. Whoa. A bad one. But still good. Are you in a hurry. When you drink that first? This hits the spot. Mom has been going crazy since last week. What happened last week? I threw a party. It was quite the rager. Mom and dad were not that pleased. Ouch. How bad was it? Well... We had puke on the walls and blood on the floor. The living room tablewas in pieces. What the hell? Where was my invitation? If I'd known you would have been on top of the list. You like to play it rough? I guess. Should we drink these and get some more? You're quite fast, aren't you? Your turn to get the next round. 0k. There you go. You like beer? No,there's nothing here. This place is dead. Too bad. Or? I once got a mite here. Okay? It was down in my groin. - What? Yeah. That's nasty. You got it off? With the pliers, you know? But I didn't get the mite disease. Bordello-osis or what's it called? You gotlucky. A friend of mine got paralyzed in the face. For real? Cool. - Yeah, not cool. Maybe you'll get paralyzed in your dick. You should be careful. Sure, I will. But what would you do with it here anyway/.7 Like you said, this place is dead. Y“PP WPP- What kind of cottage do you have? Quite close to your cottage. It hasn't actually been in any real shape in a long while. But we've always had a bed to bang in. Sorry, what did you say/.7 l have a bed to bang in. There's almost never anyone there. Ducks are ugly animals. You like ugly things? Not ugly ducks. Well what do you like? Beer. - Yeah I can see that. I finished already. Should we get more? Now it's yourturn. Be my guest. - Should we get a shot? Sure. Have you ever tasted a shot called Granny's Dimple? It is Bailey's and licorice. Granny's nipple. Granny's Dimple. Go get us some granny's nipples, will you? There are loads of grannies on the dock. lt better be a good nipple. You know it will. I'm starting to get wasted. It doesn't matter. Except if we get stopped by the harbor patrol. They suck. I know from experience. I didn't even think about that. I think I should drink a glass ofwater. Like a glass of water will do any good. I'll get some. Your mom's there. Oh,fuck! I don't think it'sthat serious? Hi, What's up? I'm on the country side with Jaakko and Miku. I'm at the bar because our cottage doesn't have internet. I needed to send a few work emails. Holiday? I'm not on a damn holiday. I've been laid off fucks sake! I need to keep the company afloat, so that I don't get fired. Listen to this. As a cherry on top, Miku destroyed our home. No, I can't get a hold of Sebu. He said that Nigeria has a shitty reception. These aren't thethings that stress me out. You remember what! said about the browser history? I trained a yoga butt, I waxed my snatch, but no... He iust does not seem interested. l waxed it all, felt like ateenager again. But still, nothing. Jaakko? Stressed out? Do you want to go fishing? l have liquor. Let's do it. You first. You've started smoking. And drinking. You'reiust like your brother. Soon you'll be helping the less fortunate in Africa. Yeah, Sebu has truly changed. How about your relationship things? How about yours? A sharp one, aren't you? Hey Jaakko. Uh, what? How about we make one more child? What? But my cords are cut? So what? There are ways to undo it. Aren't the two of them enough? What ifthey are not enough? We can try at least? Well how about our economy? Screw it! l have a freaking headache. Excuse me? Hello? Who thefuck isthis? - l have Elias's phone. How long have you been hooking up? Sorry, I don't really get what you're aiming at? Tell Elias to give me a fucking call! Come to the beach ;) Hi. My head is about to explode. Yeah. Somebody is trying to get a hold of you. I'm on a holiday. Yeah but... If you could do it anywhere, where would you do it? Do what? Grow flowers. Duh. Do it! Fuck? I don't know. Probably in a... You're still a virgin, aren't you? No I'm not. But it could be a good thing. You should hold on to that. Where would you bone? Don't think too much. Whatthe flick? What kind of a sodo-meeting is this? Excuse me? CEOs have board meetings, gays have sodo-meetings. What the fuck, Sini? I didn't know you were here? I couldn't stay away from my little brother. Did you get your morning high? Of course she did. This is my sister, Sini. Hi, I'm Miku. Hi. I need to go. I didn't know your sister was coming. Yeah, me neither. She's kind offun, when she's not fucked up. Just like you. How come? You don't have to be messed up all thetime. But it's fun. You don't know what fun is. I'm not usually, like, out of it. Are you sure? 0h flick, Sini. Ha, ha. Beally flinny. Where are my clothes? What the hell are you high on? You two were so cute, I wanted to help you out. That wasn't really helping. I got more mosquito bites. Yeah. Your food's burned on the stove. Mom's making lunch. Where's mom? I want to take your photo. Where's mom? Sini... Hello? I want to take your photo. Jesus. Wait here. Hello? Hi. - What are you up to? Did you know that Sini is here? Yeah I did. Yeah, I saw her a moment ago. What are you doing? l'm iust thinking. You should be thinking about the house sale. That's it! It's iust fine. They're buying it tomorrow. There's still lot's of things to be done. No, no. All is fine. That's why we are here. I need alcohol. Is your mom alright? What's it look like? What are you thinking? Nothing special. What did it feel like? Feel like? Did you feel it in your stomach? Have you been eating my cookies? What do you think? - So you did feel it. I sometimes get a bit cocky. lfl want to do something,l do it. Just like on the beach. Do you get it? Yeah. But we can beiust friends if you want to. I've had a few friends with benefits. We've stayed as friends even if we have boned. Are you for real? What are you on? Hotdogs. Fuck. I can be spontaneous sometimes. You don't know what you're talking about. That Bepe guy once opened up to me. He feels shitty for you shutting him out for showing emotions. Sorry, but when have you talked to him? You dragged him over to our parents. Like a thousand years ago. - Four years ago to be exact. Be that as it may, - a kid of that age shouldn't be talking to Bepe. Are you with us? Hi. Are you alright? - Yeah why wouldn't I be. lthink that Elias has more experience in boy stuff. Him kissing you doesn't necessarily make you gay. I think that this is a bit too deep for me. This discussion or everything? Or what do you mean? I don't know. Have you ever been with someone before? With girls or guys? Well... I've had thisthing with achick. What? You've been with a girl? Well? Have you? That's what! said. But to what extent? What do you mean like how? I've also had athing with achick, but... Are you bisexual? l'm Elias. Are you bisexual, Miku? - Leave him be. You started it. I think it depends on the persons. lthink so too. So you are quite far in the closet. Everybody know what I've done. - Not you. Miku. Fuck. Do you want to have kids? I want the right person. But did you get hard? Hey! I Just want you to relax. l've dreamed of cocks for along time. I dream of Transformers. lhopethey were flicking. Well. I used to be bullied, and when it stopped - I didn't want it to start all over again. I didn't want to give reason for more noise. Okay. I don't get it. Mom used to beat everybody. Then Elias got older, - and he started to do beating. Yeah, well. I punched my bully in the face. He turned out to be gay as well. Sometimes it's nice to stay invisible. To be invisible. Or ordinary. Sounds boring. But I like it. To be left alone. Don't you? We are different, you and l. Perhaps. 0k. What the flick are you blaming me for? I didn't steal your flicking card. What the hell has Sini gotten in to? I put it on the table, and then it was gone. And then you were there! Give it back! - Put that flicking thing away lknow that it was you. Give it back. Riding the cock carousel doesn't mean you can say whatever you want! What the flick is your problem? Fuck off! If you get any closer, I will get a boner. Whatthe flick? Let's take this outside! Okay, let's do it outside. You're a flicking stud. Awhat? A stud. Should we go in there? Fuck, guys. I've been looking for you all night. Your mom has called me two hundred times. Take it easy. Time to head home. Okay. I didn't sell you beer. Of course not. Just go already. Go home. l have nothing against homosexuals. As long as they don't beat me up without reason. Wake up. Your dad is coming. Your dad. Where have you been? What's up? We came by with Minna yesterday. Did you hang out with mom? We didn't see her, or anyone else for that matter. Hi. lsthisthe wild one? I haven't had a hangover in over four years. Afternoon. Who are you? l'm Koivu. I met these guys yesterday. Are you from here? I'm the driver for a documentary team. I thought about fixing the flowerbed today. Okay. I borrowed this phone. The flowerbed isn't going to build itself. How angry is mom? She was this close to calling the coast guard. But mom is mom. Fag. Can you flicking call me?? Your phone is ringing all the time. Still? - It's getting bombed constantly. You should have turned it off. But for real. He called from an unknown number. He yelled at me. So... I broke up with him a few weeks ago. Okay. - Well what? You've been here for a couple ofweeks. Are you trying to sound dramatic? My dick has been in your mouth, so I'd - like to know what's happening. It wasn't going anywhere. You got bored so you had to break it off? What're you saying? - People are messing around - and breaking up all the time. No they're not. - Yes they are. People start relationships all this time. But what isthis guy all about? It is what it is. And I'm here now. So this is iust a rebound? Does it feel like a rebound? - Answer me. I'm going to the bathroom. The condoms are in the kitchen cupboard. lthoughtl had to hide herethe whole day. Here. Thanks. Elias! I'm going into town. I'll be back in an hour. I need to take my pills and get some sleep. lt's halfpast. I'll be back in an hour. Bye. - Bye. Well that was embarrassing Come on. This is likea scenefrom a bad porn film. You're right. Too much talking in between the pounding. Oh that's iust bad. - No it's awesome. You shouldn't have given me your phone. What are you talking about? I keep thinking about what has happened. How about you iust leave it be. I can't. - Yes, you can. Maybe you need to calm me down. - Stop doing that. Don't be likethat. - What's your problem? I'm not here to start a relationship. l'm iust about to lose it. Take it easy. - lfthereis something- let's talk it through. I don't have issues. I'm here. We're having flin. Isn't that enough? But it's enough. - Then what the flick is your problem? I don't have a problem. You are iust flipping without a reason. So what's the flicking point? You're clearly not able to relax, so either we talk - or we end this right now. Just make up your mind. Maybe we should end this when summer is over. I think it sounds logical. Have you got someone waiting for you? Oh, so now you're interested? I think it's great if you have someone. It's great if you have someone you want to be with. You're weird as flick. You're the one who started this conversation. Oh, you're so messed up. I want to smoke cigarettes, flick and get wasted. Then we do that. Damn. How long have we been here? Five or six hours! guess. Where the flick is mom? We can be like this everyday if you want. Until autumn. Until summer ends. Then we can fly south. We have a place there. Oh you have two holiday homes? Yeah. Or soon we'll iust have one. How come? The one we have in Spain. We are supposed to move out from here. But we're not going to do it. I don't get it. Mom left dad. Dad moved to LA without any money. Sold this house there, to a foreigner. They're coming here the day after tomorrow. Are you for real? What are you looking for? lshouldfind mom. ls shereally missing? I always find her. We can help you clean up or move if you want? We're not cleaning up. I don't really get this. Maybe we shouldn't bother. Bight? What's happening here? I thought about going back to Helsinki. Okay. Why? This place make me flicking sick. I think we can have still have flin. How much fun are you having? I think you are stressed out. How much fun are you having? Take your phone. See you later. I can help you look for your mom. You can't answer like that. But I iust did. Who is this? lt's Miku. - I can't reach you? My phone is broken. Did Android freeze? It's in a ditch by the freeway. Are you still at the cabin? Yeah, It sucks. Where are you? I went berry picking. What? I got fired from work. You were working? Yeah, I was working at a warehouse. How can you get fired from there? I threw a suspension kit ata guy. Come here. I'm afraid of mom. Shethinks I threw the party. She doesn't even know you're home. liust can't deal with her shit. Please, iust come. I'm losing it here. Dicks. Yeah speaking of which. Yeah...? Would it be weird if! was gay? It would be weird if we started flicking. Butifyou like cock in your butt then go for it. You suddenly started to like cock? Well I am gay. - Well. Okay. Yeah. Well whatever. This is theway things went. But for real, you... You flicked that Sanna girl. Well now I fuck guys, I guess. What? Who? Thereis this guy, who I met here. Whoa, flick. What? You are gay! - That's what! am. So cool. Are you there? Yeah. You are going to get laid so much. I don't think that's the way it works. Of course it does. You've been gay for liketwo days - and you got laid already. Can I tell everyone? Not really, I want to do it myselfifl need to. This was really brave of you. I'm going to drink Ephedrine now. You crazy flick. You zone outiust like your father. Dad has narcolepsy. What do you think about when you zone out? I make melodies and sounds for things! see. The more tired I am, the better the sounds. You know, I do exactly the same thing. Oh yeah? If a grown woman dreams, people think she's crazy. Which doesn't really bother me. But if people don't get you, - they'll think you're an asshole. You can dream as much as you want. I don't need your approval. Elias is up there, if you want to see him? No, I came here to see if you're alright. Hello? - The buyers are coming tomorrow. Mom keeps calling for dad. She's not sleeping. So what? - She needs help! Don't you get it? Fuck. - Sheiust goes on and on about dad. Hello? Hello? I had to do something. I need to go now. Where the hell are you? Koivu is taking us to the hospital. You think I can do this alone?

Such a good weather. - Then go! Dad's chili eggs are served. Okay. Do you want to go fishing today? You're on your meds? Yeah, your daddy is all coked up. Hey, mom. Hi there. I'm gay. What's happening here? Sorry, that I'm crying, Miku. l'miust so happy that it was you. All these years, when I've seen gay porn - in the browser history, - I've thought that it was daddy's. l'miust so happy that it was you. I've been so flicking angry for so long. It was me. Hey, hold on. Just hold on for a minute. This is why we don't have sex anymore? You don't approach me! That's why? You do not approach me. Last time you started to cry. I thought you were doing it out of obligation. I've been blue hailed for six months and you think I'm gay/.7 A browser flill of gay porn and you are a body loving muffin. What's that supposed to mean? You're like a... some flicking... You like gardening. You're tender. What the hell are you talking about? You're way gayer than Miku! You can flick in here for all I care. Where are you going? Where the flick ever. We are going to Porvoo. Let him cool off for awhile. What the hell are we going to Porvoo for?

I still think that you're making it up. Sorry. Do you want to hang out? Mom thinks that dad's gay. My mom thinks dad's the love other life. Your mom doesn't get how hard it is to you. Your mom doesn't know shit as well. lfthis is a contest, lthink your mom wins. Okay. How about we have some flin for now. And then you leave and that's okay. But let's not be here. Fuck it. Batman calling... One missed call. Morning. Hi there. Do you want chili eggs? What? - Breakfast. I can make some. Nah, I don't know. Last night I understood what a dickhead I am. How come? I thought about stuff. lthink you're cool. No, I'm quite the dickhead. l was with the guy for liketwo years. And then I iust.... vanished. Go talk with him. I don't want to talk to him. lt bothers you that he wants to talk to you. Yeah because he wants me back. Since when has that been your problem? Aren't you the guywho says people break up too easily? Plenty disagree with me. I'm not even twenty years old. Why should I care? lshouldn't. Well don't. I need to get going. Are you coming back before fall? Batman doesn't kill people. So you are going to talk with him? That's pretty cool. - Don’t get too excited. It might not become a habit. I haven't got any problems. You go and do your thing. Have you seen my socks? Dad's socks are in the bedroom closet if you want. Is your dad in the closet as well? Do you like The Sopranos? I haven't watched it. I thought that if you come back, - we could help dad with gardening, - and binge watch it from thetablet. Or..? Sure. Luckilythere's still some summer left. See you later.
