Chiang Tai Dye Mill Ah Sheng, the dye has been quite bad of late. The color doesn't stay. That's right, someone must be behind this Sheng bro, the chief wants to talk to you Sir, is this OK? It's all right Brother Sheng Chief Look at this, how come it's like this? How can this be acceptable? Our dye is a little... - A little what? It's the same dye See, theirs is much darker Why is our dye lighter? - Maybe we need to concentrate it a little What's the matter? They are from Manchuria Our boss hired them To mix the colors. - Then I... Don't worry! You can still work here They have come to assist you I have no problem in that But I have to go talk to the others There's no need; you do your own thing They have their own jobs. - I'm afraid it will delay work Yes. The colors will be a mess. Relax, we brought our color sticks Look What do you need the rods for? This is the special tool from Manchuria It's quite special So it's got to be alright. - The boss said, from today onwards... You will have a pay cut of 20 percent - Why? Why do we have to bear a pay cut? - You wish to know the reason? The 20 percent is so we can pay them That's not right. - That's highway robbery! You Manchurians shouldn't be violent. You should be reasonable. Brother Sheng... This is the most sensible thing What do you want to do? Brother Sheng... You... Ah Chao, Shih Sheng, stop messing around Why are you hitting... it's unreasonable - Stop fighting; stop it! Our fabric is getting worse recently That's why our boss is hiring the technicians Yuan Li Hou and Chuan Min are here to help you It's because of the Manchurians. We have to take a pay cut. Be quiet! This is the boss' idea. Take it or leave it! Then I'll be the first to leave! - Chou Shih Sheng I'll quit too! - Me too! I'm also leaving! - So am I! I'll go too! - Count me in! I'm not going to stay either! Let's go... I'll go too! Stop! What a nerve, Chou Shih Sheng! You started a strike Whoever dares to leave the mill... ...I'll break his legs - Move away Move it... You want to fight? Stop fighting I'll break your legs Don't fight anymore Chuan Min, you can't even beat the women We'll beat you! Goddamn Manchurian Cut it out... All right, chief. We'll follow his orders And take the pay cut. - Now go back to work! Ah Chao Are you alright? Chief Ma recruited some Manchurians. And made us take a pay cut They are violent and looking for fights They must've planned it before, Shih Seng Uncle Li, you've been here for a long time. We have been earning a lot for him You're the color specialist in Chiang Tai The raw materials are worse than before. I knew it would not work All right, we should go to talk to the boss It's no use fighting against Manchurians The boss himself hired them Well... Mr. Li? Can we go to the court? - That's worse; let me tell you why Boss holds influence in their court Can't sue him and get beaten up if we don't work If we work we receive less money Who knows how much they'll deduct later! Why do we even bother coming to work? - How I wish that we knew some Kung Fu Ah Chao! - We'd fight them if we knew how Don't worry about bruises and injury. Our wonder pills from Shaolin... ...heal all bruises. Cures cuts. Improves circulation You can eat half and rub the rest on Better than candy, I'd say In my opinion we should continue working. Rather not create a scene with them. True, let's avoid getting beaten up You're all here Hey, don't rush... This can cure it... You're lucky, sir Take the whole box; go ahead... What the hell are you doing? Ah Chieh... Our work is different from yours We have to pretend to be someone. To be a monkey you need to look like one To be a monk you need to be bald. They always fall for it How come you're all free tonight? - Our boss hired a whole bunch of Manchurians We need to give up pay for them Your brother got into a fight with them. Ah Chao got hurt too Let me look at it, Ah Chao. - What are you doing? You dare to sell me fake medicine. - What are you talking about? My medicine is really from Shaolin Temple. - Do you really think you're a monk? Aren't I? The monks from Shaolin know martial arts. - Well, so do I Good then, go get revenge for Ah Chao Don't push me into it. I can't use my skills for revenge It's for peaceful purposes. - What the hell is that kind of martial arts? It's only for a living. - Don't lie Who is lying? Shut up, let's go Ah Chieh Thanks, I'm leaving now Li Se, donate twenty cents Merciful Buddha, Shaolin Temple needs fixing Please donate some money Move it, I don't have... - Your goodness will be aptly rewarded He is over there. - It's really him! Let's go over to see him Is that OK? - Don't worry Gentleman, Lady, Shaolin need repairs. Donate some money to help out? Chu Jen Chieh What, it's you You're really good at this. - Of course, otherwise all those... All those dummies wouldn't fall for it. - We'd like you to pretend to be a monk And take revenge for us with your kung fu Don't count on me; they will kill me Are you Chu Shih Seng's brother? - Yes, I am Are you our friend? - Of course You see, they took advantage of us. Are you going to help? I will. - What are you waiting for? Hi, big fellow. I'm not really a Shaolin monk I'm just pretending to be one. - That's it; let's go... We'll tell you the details. - Let's talk about it when we get home I know this is for stirring yellow Do you like the other shades of yellow? - What other kinds of yellow? Are you playing with me? Hsiao Hung! There are too many people here, hold on She'll bring out the yellow fabric later You just follow her Hsiao Hung What are you doing here? - And you? Why are you here? Ah Chuan I'm... here for a girl Is that true? - Both of you got a date or what? Yeah. - With who? The girl with the yellow fabric. - You... That cute one with the yellow fabric - You too? Is that her? - That's her Let's go Goddamn it; you people are too much. Had our salary reduced... And still you tease the ladies - You jerk! Dare to mess with me? Get them! Break it off! Who the hell are you? - I'm a Shaolin monk, San Te Monk San Te?! That's me Merciful Buddha Great kung fu! You really from Shaolin? - That's right No wonder you could do that! Why are you fighting here? Is that necessary? He's great. - Good timing. Venerable monk We're the workers from Chiang Tai Mill. They are the famous Manchurian technicians Our boss hired them. And we all got a pay cut Beat them up! Why are you so reckless? If I didn't hold myself back... You would either be dead or injured All the workers, please listen. - Yes... About your pay cut... I'll try my best to help you. - Really? Thank you... San Te You go back to tell your chief. I'll visit him later Let's go They left Chief! A monk has come from Shaolin. - Who is he? Monk San Te Isn't he the abbot of the 36 chambers? - Yes, he is Don't get nervous. What can he do to us? Chu Shih Seng asked him to come over here. - Come here; why? Perhaps he's here for us. - Ok, we'll see how tough he is His martial arts is unbeatable, sir Is he really that good? - Did you fight against him? We haven't had a chance. But he did show off a little His steps and strength are incredible. I don't think we can handle him So he's coming to help the workers. Where is he now? He's waiting outside for our reply. - He came to our doorstep? Everyone... don't worry. We don't need to sacrifice our pay We asked a monk to help us. Move it... Are you looking for trouble? Get to work C'mon, get to work... What're you doing? Ah Chao! They're coming. - Move your fat ass Please come in You... Merciful Buddha This is monk San Te from Shaolin He has come here today... To restore justice Why the hell did ya have to blather to him about our factory affairs? Everything is going on so smoothly Chief Ma, you took part of our pay for the Manchurians. And you still think we are happy? Yes, he dares to think that! - Please listen to me. Let's discuss it over Chief Ma It's really unreasonable I mean, we're all human beings They don't need to work and they get paid. And though we need to work very hard... we still bear with a pay cut The government is controlled by Manchuria There's a difference because they are Manchurian. - You are relying on the power of Manchurians To force us to agree for a pay cut. - Who said that? You don't need to work if the pay is no good You'll beat us up if we don't work. - Yes... Please have mercy, chief Ma Merciful Buddha Monk San Te The Government sent them. Please stay away from our business Don't get involved I can help you if you need a donation How much do you want? Just give me a number I... Fifty taels One, two, three, four, five This is bribery. Let's beat them up Stop! Don't be afraid Violence isn't a solution to problems What do you think, Chief Ma? Don't you agree with me? No... Have mercy You still can change your mind. Sir Give them their old wages OK I'll listen to you. Monk San Te Merciful Buddha! You're a good man. - Yes Please listen carefully You'll get the same pay as before. All of you can go back to work That's great! Thank you for your help. - You... Please Shih Seng Ge, using Jen Chiehs skill. Plus our great ideas Those goddamn Manchurians. They couldn't believe it But they believe it now Honestly, I can pretend to be anyone. I'm very skillful I can even feign to be a girl I'm so eighteen and never had a boyfriend Let's drink... cheers... Don't be too confident, Ah Chieh. We were lucky to fool them this time What if you can't fool them next time, you'll... Look at me! It'll always work What are you doing now? No more pay cut, Shih Sheng We can finally relax. Come on... Let's have a drink Go ahead! Let's drink... The monk should've stayed in Shaolin Why did he come to Canton?? - I saw him in Chiang Tai Dyeing Mill His martial arts are unbeatable All of you are afraid of him. So... I just wanted to calm things down. I agreed to give them their old pay for a while Idiot There are many great fighters in Shaolin Had I offended him... All of the workers will be against us Of course with your contacts... There shouldn't be a problem Shaolin Temple should keep to its own matters Let's wait a while. After the monk leaves... we'll reduce their pay again Fine then. You can leave Hold on! Did you fight against him? - No So he just showed off a little But he is really tough. - OK... Please ask monk San Te to come over here I want to see how much he can do. - Of course Keep steady Master... Monk San Te is here, Mr. Wong You are... - I'm the monk San Te You are from... - I'm from Shaolin Temple And why, may I ask are you here? For donations or to help people Both It looks like you missed one reason I don't think so Well, to promote Shaolin martial artsa Oh, I practice some time I really would like to see that I hope you can show me some moves. - That's no problem Ah Chao! Please let me have the honor, Master I... Please This rock is too big; might hurt the workers Wonderful... it's a very unusual step Your eyesight is great You can see the pebble from so far away This is from outside Your inner strength should be even stronger Would you show us? Please grant us the honor. Master All right. I'm going to show you something Come on. We are waiting I don't want you to hit those workers You can fight with us But I'm afraid I'll hurt you. - We want to see your great skill We're willing to take the chance Go ahead Monks don't encourage fighting, Mr. Wong If martial arts is what you'd like to see... You can come to Shaolin Temple That'll be all. I have to go Please don't leave. Monk San Te You came down from the top. Can you go up the same way? I think walking the stairs will be faster. - You... Ah Chieh, you... Did everyone see it? You've seen it already San Te You don't need to send me out Don't move Chief Ma, please don't push me to fight That's what I want you to do. - We can talk about it This pole is not suitable for me You can use your internal strength Show me the best of Shaolin What is this? You asked a monk to help you. He is a bloody looser Where is your unbeatable skill? Monk I... It's your fault. - Stupid bald guy. - Let's go What should we do with him? - He dared to fool you You can use real Kung Fu to deal with him You're still playing around Chief, Chuan Ge I don't think he can stand it anymore Please let him go. We'll apologize to you Apologize. - All of us will do it... No, it's no use Brother Chuan, we beg of you. Please release him I beat up the people who cheated me My goodness, please help Go ahead! Everyone Let's go... Damn it! Beat him Look... he is really in bad shape. - Uncle Li, what did they do? Don't be noisy... How is your wound? They blew San Te's cover I told you before. You can fool them once. You can't make it twice All of our workers were beaten We are going to lose our jobs Big brother So dear monk, what're you going to do? God! What was I thinking... And caused so much trouble for everyone. - Shut up Why don't you try to make a living? Get some honest work Don't always opt for the easy way out Just like you, Big brother? Look at you! You're punch bags You deserve it because you cheated others But not only did you get punished... All the workers suffered too That's true. I shouldn't involve everyone But I made it the first time No one got a pay cut. It would be fine if we stop then I shouldn't have continued the act. Do you really think I know Kung Fu? I can't do anything. - You ought to learn some useful skill All right, I will Don't expect my help when I succeed Ah Chieh Chou Jen Chieh This time... Who do you want me to be? Monastery of Wu Dong or Bai Mei You want me to be a governor or an officer? Tell me. Who do you want me to be? Aren't I good? Yes Look at you Are you pretending you got beaten up? Ah Chao was beaten up Ah Chao's injuries are real I always try to fool others Why did I do it? - You don't need to lie How can I compete with others without lying? With real Kung Fu. - You're still pulling my leg You know that I can't do Kung Fu. - You can learn it Where can I go to learn it? You can go to Shaolin Temple Shaolin. Why don't you go? All of us were injured. - Will they take sissies like us? You think Shaolin is that easy to enter? Not for others; but you can, Ah Chieh Why me? You can pretend to be a monk. - That's right You askin' me to do it again? - Ah Chieh You'd rather see us suffer, Jen Chieh. And let them bully us forever Yes, after you learn kung fu... We won't need to lie All right. Say, even if I can get in Shaolin, it'd still require many years to learn. - That's all right. No matter what We'll wait for you to avenge us I'll learn not only for revenge But also so that I can teach you. - Then we'll be able to protect ourselves Yes. Merciful Buddha. - OK Don't get close. I'm really a monk, I can't get near women folk But not me Don't hit me - What the hell are you talking about? Go collect the grain. Don't stand here Collect the grain? Take it over Stop hitting me... There is someone here. Cut it out I'm not a barrel. Stop it. Oh come off it, please What are you doing? I'll make you carry 50 bags of grain each Master... Master? How do you teach these little monks? It's because I'm not capable You can all rest today Please take me to Shaolin Temple first. - As you wish Old monk. How can you treat a master so rudely? Stop lying! I'll hang you on the big tree over there. If you dare pretend to be a monk again Hurry up! Go now! Continue collecting the grain Move faster... Shaolin monks are carrying vegetables back Master. This is not easy to digest. - I know Master, you... I was a monk since I was little. I was scared of the scarring pain... So I moved No wonder!

Let's go. - Come back! Stop... What is your problem? - Is this for real? I have done my homework To go to Shaolin Temple. You got to have a lot of courage Did he ask for all of us? There is the rule monk San Te sets After one year, the freshers... Can go home for a while Why is that? - For no apparent reason He needs to ensure your willpower, to see if the person has consistency and endurance What will happen otherwise? - You can't go back anymore And if one comes through all the tests? - He will let them know He'll tell them which day to return Which day of which month? - The next day Really the next day - Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve One dozen. Thank you Excuse me! I didn't see you It's very difficult to make it, Ah Te. Yes, I found the solution Just line up with all those monks Please help me Thank you. Please help me out... Let me go...

Please Please lend me this bucket I can't get water without a bucket How can I wash my head without water? Isn't this water? How can you use a rock to get the water? There is only a rock. There'd be nothing left if I throw it Luckily there is no one here Why is there no water in the evening? There is no bucket. What should I do? I can take it off to wash That wouldn't be so appropriate Show your face To fling a letter stuck on knife is an old trick The less you think about, the better you hit San Te Abbot San Te.

Abbot I climbed up and down. From left to right Day and night Sunrise to Sunset Are you sure? Well, sometimes I did watch them practice But please believe me. I didn't waste time It's very durable, Abbot San Te. Abbot San Te... It's very strong. - I can tell it's very strong I want you to tear it down now I beg your pardon? Tear it down! Yes, you can leave after you finish. You will be free to go I have to go after I take it down! Is that some kind of a prank, Master? - How can you treat others like that? I thought you'd take me as your apprentice, after I finished my task Now you ask me to tear it down. Isn't that like making fun of me? You dare talk back to a Shaolin Abbot? Don't you know you can be punished? The worse is you'd send me to the Heaven. - You... What did you want to say? I thought Shaolin monks were reasonable How come you aren't? - Shut up. Get out right now I'm not leaving just because you say so You're really a cunning monk At the most I'll need to tie it back again But I will not leave now There is no way you're sending me away. I'm going to stay in Shaolin I want to learn martial arts Starting from the beginning So you won't leave, is it? - Nope You can't make me leave Never What happened?
