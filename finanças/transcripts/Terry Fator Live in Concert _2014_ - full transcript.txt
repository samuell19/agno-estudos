Yeah, I guess I gotta break it to you sometime. - Break what to me? - Here goes. Awhile back, I won "America's got talent" for you. See? They know. And sold out your show here at the mirage for four years! But, Terry, you don't pay me enough to keep up my new Vegas lifestyle. Wait. What is your new Vegas lifestyle?

So you don't make enough money in my show. What are your plans? You know, Terry, there are a lot of other shows in Vegas - I could try out for. - Really? - Yeah. - Like which ones? Well, look at the screen, I could try out for this show here. Oh! What is that?! I was young and I needed the money. I made some badchoices. Yes, you did. Ohh. Okay, Winston, please. You have got to show me something else. You have to get that picture out of my head. Okay. Look at the screen. I could try out for this show. I don't think you would like working in the blue man group. - How come? - Well, they don't talk, and I know how much you love to talk. No, it's weird. When you're not around, I don't talk at all. You know, I could go out for that new turtle version of "survivor." There's a turtle version of "survivor"? - Yeah. - What's it called? "So you think you can cross the road." - Hey, Terry? - What?

Terry. - What? - Nothing. I just feel good. Why do you feel good? 'Cause, Terry, I'm taking this opportunity to announce that I, Walter t. Airdale, am running for president. Wait wait wait wait. Of the United States? No. The hair club for men. Of course the United States! Walter, you're totally unprepared. You're always broke and you're always borrowing money. See, I'll make a great president. I even got my own campaign poster. What? Oh. Yeah. So-- so how's the campaign going? Just terrible, Terry. I got these personal attacks already started. - Personal attacks? That's terrible. - Yeah. I got these crazy people trying to say I wasn't born in America. - Really? - Yeah, but I got proof. You have your birth certificate? You bet I do. I notice you have brass nuts. Oh yeah. Every president should have them. Okay. Now now. Now I would not ask any of you good voters to vote for me unless I have full disclosure. What's full disclosure? I want you folks to know that I have only had three scandals in my entire life. That's it, just three. No more, no less. Only three. Really? Just three scandals? Yeah, and I can explain all three of them. - Well, explain them. - Okay. With this first one, someone hacked into my twit account. For my second scandal, I had an eight-night stand with the octo-mom. Terry: Walter. And for my third and final scandal, I spent too much time driving Willie Nelson's tour bus. Terry: What? Walter-- That's just wrong. Okay. So that's it. That's the only three scandals you've ever had. That's right Terry. Now if you don't mind, I'd like to sing my campaign song. It's a little song that when I become president it's gonna become the new motto of America.

All this campaigning, it's exhausting. Not only that, earlier today I cut myself shaving and my face really hurts. You got a medic on staff? - Walter, as a matter of fact, we do. Could we get somebody to come out here and look at Walter? I have only had four scandals in my entire life. That's it. Just four. Terry, take my hat off. There's a lady present. Okay. Uh, ma'am? I tell you what. Not only are you lovely, but I can tell just by looking at you that you got yourself a compassionate nature. Earlier today, ma'am, I cut myself shaving. And my face hurts powerful bad. Would it be okay with you if I come over there and put my injured cut face against your lovely, compassionate... Nature? Then you could take me backstage and take my temperature... - The old fashioned way. - Wait, what? - What is that supposed to mean? - Let's just say I put the "ky" in Kentucky. Oh, that's terrible! I can't believe-- Would that be all right? Sorry. Stop laughing. I can't talk. Sorry. Would that be okay with you? Finally something about health care reform we can all agree on! There you go.- Woman: Walter! You're married. Walter: I have only had five scandals in my entire life. And now please welcome my dear friend and lounge singer, monty Carlo. Monty, listen, I got to tell you. It's great to have you here. Terry, I almost did not get here tonight. Wow, what happened? Well, I'm a little out of breath because I got stuck in traffic, and I just got here a second ago. Wow. Most of us have probably been stuck in that Las Vegas strip traffic. You know, I saw the strangest thing out there just now. - You want to see? - Yeah. What did you see? Okay, well, anyway. We're certainly glad you made it. So you told me you had some exciting news. Yes, I most certainly do, Terry. You know, I have been watching "America's got talent" this season, and I decided next year I'm gonna audition. Well, that's great news. In case you're not familiar with monty's work, he's been trying to hit the big-time for a long time. Now I heard though that at one time you were in a famous band? - Yeah. Who. - You. - No, who. - That's what I'm asking. No, Terry, listen. I was in the band. - You were in the band? - No, I was in who. - That's what I'm asking. - Terry, listen to me. I was in the band. You were in the band? No, who. - You were in who? - Yes. - Oh, you were in yes? - No, I was in who. - I'm trying to guess who. - No, Terry. I was never in the guess who. I was in who! - You were in who? - Yes. - You were in yes? - No, I was in the band. You just said you weren't in the band. I wasn't. I was in who! - Yes? - That's what I'm saying. - This is ludicrous. - No, I never played with him. Anyways. So what are your plans on "America's got talent"? Have you thought about what you're gonna do when you audition? Well, Terry, actually that's why I'm here. You know, I thought I'd get a little advice from the master. - You mean me? - Yeah. Oh, you know what they love on that show is when guys your age do modern songs. Do you know any modern tunes? Like what? Do you "sexy and I know it"? You know Terry, as a matter of fact, I do. ♪ If you're sexy and I know it ♪ ♪ clap your hands... ♪ If you're sexy and I know it ♪ ♪ clap your hands ♪ if you're sexy and I know it-- ♪ Oh, man, that didn't work out at all. - No, it did not. - Hey, maybe I should stick to what I know?

Thank you so much. Monty, monty. I gotta tell you, that sounded a lot like Dean-o. Well, you know what helps? If you have a couple of Martinis before you sing it. Hey, do you-- do you have time to sing one more? You know, Terry, since I talk like him, I might as well sing like him too. ♪ I left my heart... ♪ In San Francisco ♪ high on a hill ♪ it calls to me ♪ to be where ♪ little cable cars ♪ climb halfway to the stars ♪ ♪ the morning fog ♪ may chill ♪ the air ♪ I don't care ♪ my love waits there ♪ in San Francisco ♪ above the blue ♪ and windy sea ♪ when I come home ♪ to you ♪ San Francisco ♪ your golden sun ♪ will shine ♪ for ♪ me.

Do you-- do you realize I just introduced you to two guys who have big aspirations to do great things? Now I want to introduce you to someone who has no aspirations to do anything. This guy lives right next door to us-- duggie: Dude. All of us at one time or another has had an annoying neighbor. If you haven't, then you're it. This guy lives right next door to us. He stays up all hours of the night with his rowdy friends-- duggie: Dude. Ladies and gentlemen, my annoying neighbor. All right, so, duggie-- dude! What? Why are you dressed like this? Dude, I'm a new superhero. I call myself... Captain Morgan. Along with my trusty sidekick, Jose cuervo. Give me this. It's ridiculous. Now look. The reason I brought you out here, duggie. - Is-- - dude! What? Hey, did you know there's a lot of people here? Yes. What are they doing here? Duggie, these people came here for you. - They came here for me? - They did. I swear the stuff's not mine! I have a prescription. My grandma has glaucoma! Duggie, no no. No no no no no. Duggie, duggie, no. They came here to watch you entertain them. - Oh, entertain. - Yes. Oh. Whoo. Look, the reason I brought you out here-- - squirrel! - Duggie, please. The reason I brought you out, I want to know how you're doing. Dude, I'm not doing too good ever since I heard that Lance Armstrong got banned for life for doping. Yeah, he-- Lance Armstrong did get banned for life for doping. If Las Vegas banned people for doping, you'd be talking to your hand right now. And you wouldn't have a band. What? So you're a real party animal? You have no idea, dude. I partied all the way through college, but hey, I still graduated with a 4.0. That was your grade? No. Blood alcohol level. Is that all you do is drink and get wasted and have a good time? No, sometimes I drink and get wasted and have a bad time. That's called having balance in my life. Well, if that's all you do, how do you make a living? Well, actually, dude, that's why I'm here. See, I've invented some products that's gonna make me a millionaire. Oh really? Yeah, all I need is some dude who has a contract with maybe a hotel in Las Vegas. Maybe someone with their own theater. - Who you talking about? - Dude! Wait wait. Me? - And they call me the dummy. - Okay. Look dude, I'm trying to make you a partner in duggie co! What kind of partner would I be? The best kind of partner-- a silent partner. Let me introduce you to my line of products. I call this first one the highpod. It only plays music for the herbally enhanced. This next one is the ez baked oven. It even comes with my family recipe for brownies... With 11 secret herbs. 11 herbs? - Duggie: Actually just one. - I figured. This next one is hangover helper. Terry: So far I don't see anything I would want to invest in. Oh, you're gonna love this next one, though. What is it? What is the one thing you hate about walking your dog? Nothing, duggie. I love to walk my dog. But do you love to have to pick up the poo after he's done with his business? Well, it's part of the job. Not anymore. Not with the revolutionary fecal decal. Terry: What? Now all you gotta do is stick one of these on it and people will be happy to see it laying there. Oh! That's horrible. Duggie, you don't even own a dog. But I will when I get my next product. The drug-sniffing-dog sniffer. Terry: What? Oh yeah. Yeah, the drug-sniffing-dog sniffer can also-- he can also distract a drug-sniffing dog while you hide your stash. How is that little dog gonna distract the drug-sniffing dog? Okay, we're done. That's it. No, stop it. We're done. That's it. Duggie, I haven't seen one single thing I would invest in. Dude, that sucks. Yeah. So you haven't made any money. What are you gonna do? Well, I guess I'm gonna go back and get in my home and drive it back to where I'm from. Where are you from? Duggie: Turn it up! ♪ Big wheels keep on turning ♪ ♪ carry me home to see my kin ♪ ♪ singing songs about the southland ♪ ♪ miss my family once again ♪ ♪ and I think it's a sin sing it, come on! ♪ Sweet home Alabama ♪ where the skies are so blue ♪ ♪ and the government true ♪ sweet home Alabama ♪ sweet home ♪ lord, I'm coming home to you. ♪ Here I come!

I made some bad choices. But come on, admit it. There's a little duggie in all of us, right? Duggie: Dude. How come the little bald guy gets to go off with the hot nurse and I get stuck in here? Duggie. - Right now-- - duggie: Dude. You got anything to eat? I'm starving. Duggie, please. Anyway. Right now I'd like to introduce someone who is so amazing he only needs one name.

I didn't always look like this. - No, you didn't? - No, I did have a little plastic surgery. - Really? - Yes, I did. What did you used to look like? You know, Terry, before I got out here just now I was across the street at the venetian. Did you realize you have a friend that works over there? I did not know that. I took a picture.

Emma Taylor singing aretha Franklin. Thank you. I gotta tell you in the four years I've been here at the mirage, it's just been amazing. So many wonderful things have happened and it's been quite a journey. And I want to tell you about a specific story about a family who came out to see my show awhile back. They had a four-year-old boy who had cancer. And through the make-a-wish foundation, they were able to offer him a trip to wherever he wanted to go. Now being four-years-old, they assumed that he would tell them he wanted to go to-- to Disneyland, but he told them he wanted to go to Las Vegas... To see Terry fator. It was-- it was such a wonderful evening. He loved the show. He loved all the puppets. And then afterwards, we took the family backstage and I introduced him to a couple of the characters, gave him one of the little Winston turtles you see out front. It was just-- it was just a magical evening. And about a week later his parents called and told us that he had passed away. There was a song that I had written several years before. I was doing it in all my shows up until I started in Vegas. The experts that were helping me put my "Las Vegas" show together explained to me that even though that song was loved by audiences coast to coast, it would never work here. "These Las Vegas audiences, they're different. Those people are never gonna understand why you would ever put a song like that in a Las Vegas show"... I was told. And that was a woman. Anyway... I did what they asked. I removed the song from my show. But after hearing from that little boy's parents, I wished I'd done it that night 'cause I truly felt that it would have meant a lot for them to hear it. So I put it back in my show in memory of that little boy. This is that song. It's called "horses in heaven." ♪ Little Bobby playing ♪ with his six-year-old friend ♪ ♪ plastic horses gallop ♪ on imaginary wind ♪ they play all day ♪ when Bobby asks what he wants next year ♪ ♪ when he turns seven ♪ with a sigh ♪ his friend replied ♪ "are there horses in heaven? ♪ ♪ Are there horses in heaven? ♪ Can we ride them to the stars? ♪ ♪ Will they take us up to Jesus ♪ ♪ and drop us off in his arms? ♪ ♪ Will I know how to ride them ♪ ♪ before I get to be seven ♪ ♪ I just got to know ♪ are there horses in heaven?" ♪ ♪ After months and months of chemo ♪ ♪ Bobby's friend is getting weak ♪ ♪ he spends less and less time here ♪ ♪ now he can hardly speak ♪ ♪ Bobby asks him what he wants ♪ ♪ next month when he turns seven ♪ ♪ a tight hold on his little horse ♪ ♪ he said ♪ "are there horses in heaven? ♪ ♪ Are there horses in heaven? ♪ ♪ Can we ride them through the stars? ♪ ♪ Will they take us up to Jesus ♪ ♪ and drop us off in his arms? ♪ ♪ Will I know how to ride them ♪ ♪ before I get to be seven? ♪ ♪ Someone tell me please ♪ are there horses in heaven?" ♪ ♪ Bobby didn't see his friend ♪ ♪ after that day came ♪ his mama couldn't find the words ♪ ♪ didn't know how to explain ♪ ♪ she finally told little Bobby ♪ ♪ "your friend never reached seven" ♪ ♪ Bobby said "I know, mom, he told me ♪ ♪ oh guess what?

Thank you so much. See, I knew you would get it. That song was based on a true story that a woman told to me. And she asked me if I would write a song about it. And it was actually a gift given to me in a dream. I dreamt every word of that song. And I feel I should be responsible with that gift, so we are working on releasing it nationally. I want you to know the proceeds are going to St. Jude's hospital. Maybe you'd like a copy of the song. It's available on iTunes. So I'm gonna ask you a question. Well, first of all, let me just say have you noticed that I've been singing a few songs by myself tonight? I like to do that occasionally 'cause after seeing me on television, most people don't even realize I can sing. No, it's true. I know what you're thinking. You're sitting out there saying to yourselves, "that's all well and good, but get back to it, puppet boy." Okay. Okay, here's the question: - Would anyone-- - duggie: Dude. Could you order a pizza? I'm still hungry. Duggie, please. Anyway. All right. Here's the question: Would anyone like to hear some Elvis Presley? I can't do Elvis. But lucky for all of us, earlier today I was out in the casino. This guy came up and started talking to me. He was wearing an Elvis costume. What are the odds? Anyway. He told me he's the best Elvis impersonator in the world. So here to help me out tonight, please welcome the self-proclaimed world's greatest Elvis impersonator! All right. - So-- - oh, Terry. Oh oh oh oh oh. Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my goodness gracious, Terry, oh my goodness gracious, Terry. What? Terry, I, um-- I have to tell you something, Terry. What is it? Okay okay. I just-- I just want you to know that I feel very good about myself right now. - Really? That's wonderful. - Yeah. Why do you feel good about yourself? 'Cause, um-- right before I got here just now, Terry, - I helped somebody. - Really? Yeah, right out front of the mirage. That's very sweet. Who did you help? I took a picture. Okay. Well, thanks for helping him. All right. So why don't you start by telling everybody your name? Okay, my name-- My name is-- is-- it is, um... Okay. My name-- is-is-is-- just-- okay. Let me start over. - My name-- - just tell them your name! Okay. Maynard tompkins. - Maynard tompkins. - That's right. Maynard, you told me earlier that you're the best Elvis impersonator in the world. That's right. In-in-in-- Terry, you could-- you-- in-- - yes, I am. - Okay. Well, that's great. So just do it. Do what? - Do your impression. - I can't do it in front of people. - Where do you do it? - Inside my head. Listen, I'll do it right now. Listen listen. Oh, it sounds fantastic tonight. Yeah, I bet it does. Maynard, look, I brought you out-- Terry, when-- When I get in front of people, Terry, that's when I get nervous. And-- and when I get nervous, Terry, that when I start-- that's when i-- it makes-- I have trouble communicating. Yeah, okay. Well, look. There's an old-- oh, okay okay. There's an old show business trick I've heard about. When people like you get nervous in front of a crowd, all you have to do is look out at the audience-- really? I can do that. Okay, now imagine them in their underwear. What? It's supposed to help you relax. - It is? - Yeah. Okay, well, I'll try anything here. You know, this is relaxing. - Hey! - What? Some of them ain't wearing underwear! What Elvis songs do you know? Terry, I know every single Elvis song ever recorded in the world. - That is amazing. - I know, Terry. I am amazing. Well, why don't we let the audience yell their favorite Elvis song out. You pick any one of them you want. - And sing it. - Terry, that is just a fine idea. Okay. Don't be shy. Yell them right out for me. Wait wait. Raise your hand if you said "love me tender." Who said "love me tender"? Raise their hand. Oh, this lady right over here. Okay. Come on up here. No no no no. Don't. Maynard. She wants you to sing the Elvis song "love me tender." Oh, I thought she was flirting with me. No. That's too bad 'cause she's one of the ones that's not wearing underwear. - Love me tender! - Stop yelling. Don't yell. Use your mic. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Love me tender. Do you actually know "love me tender"? Yes, Terry. That happens to be my very favoritest - Elvis song ever in the world. - That's amazing. Ma'am, you picked his favorite Elvis song in the world. Okay. Here it comes. Prepare to be dazzled. Okay, here it comes. Love me. Love me tender. Aah. ♪ Love me ten-- aah. Okay. I don't know "love me tender." You-- you just told that lady-- I know every single Elvis song except "love me tender." I am so sorry. Why don't you pick a song - and do it. - Really? I can pick any one I want? - Any one you want. - Really? Okay. Let me think here. "All shook up!" Okay okay okay. Don't yell. Use your microphone. Now do you actually know - "all shook up"? - Yes, Terry. That is my favoritest Elvis song ever in the entire world. Fine. Just do it. Okay okay. All shook up. Okay. Here it comes. No more messing around here. Here it comes. Aah. Aah! Aah. I don't know "all shook up." Maynard! - I want--! - You don't have to yell. You have a microphone. Maynard, do you know any Elvis songs at all? No, I don't. I have been deliberately wasting your time. I do know an Aaron Neville song.

What's the matter, Terry? What-- what's the matter? What's the matter, Terry? - What's the matter? - Read my lips. What's the matter? You look perturbed. You look perturbed. Dang, that's hard to say without moving your lips. It really is. That's got all the hard letters. It really does. I think I'll try it. Perturbed. Dang, I think I did that better than you. You did. Okay. How come you're so upset? Because, maynard, you came out here under false pretenses. I don't know what that means. - What? - False... Okay, it means you came out here telling everybody you knew every Elvis song in the world, and then you didn't know any. - Look. I'm just-- - I can make it better. - Really? - Yeah. How are you gonna make it better? Okay okay. See, I have a plan. - Really? - Yes. And my plan-- okay. You're gonna feel much better after my plan. What is your plan? Okay.

Maynard, those were both Elvis songs. - They were? - Yes. Oh, then I guess I am the best Elvis impersonator in the world. Maynard tompkins, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, maynard has left the building. And now please welcome a gentleman who is relatively new to the entertainment community. He's on his world coming out tour. Put your hands together for the amazing and wonderful Barry fabulous. Oh, thank you so much for getting me out of the closet. It was getting crowded in there. I bet it was. So it's very nice to meet you, Barry fabulous. And it is nice to meet you, ferry tator. No, it's not ferry tator. No, Barry. It's Terry fator. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm fabulous and dyslexic. Okay. So I understand you have a very important announcement you wanted to make? I certainly do. I want all of you to know that I finally got up enough nerve to tell my father about my lifestyle choice. I went into his room and I said... "Papa? ♪ Can you hear me?" Well, that would do it. Um... So that must have taken a lot of courage. It certainly did. And you know, I'm gonna use the same courage to tell all of you the same thing I told my father. I want all of you to know that I, Barry fabulous, am a proud... Lawyer. - Lawyer? - That's right. With the law firm "fabulous, fabulous, long, and fabulous." Which fabulous are you? Oh honey, I'm long. I'm also a proud member of the l.G.B.T. Community. - Okay, we figured that. - That's right, lawyer guys banding together. Did you just say "lawyer guys banding together"? That's what I said. What do you guys do? We give each other restraining orders. We just love the oral arguments. And there's nothing more fabulous than a hung jury. Terry: Okay, that's enough. Thank you. Okay. So as a-- sorry. As an attorney, have you been able to represent any celebrities? You know, I just got my very first celebrity this week. It's a very famous cowboy from right here in Las Vegas. Really? What did he do? He spent too much time with prince Harry. What? Okay. - So, uh-- - Walter: I have only had six scandals in my entire life. Thank you, Walter. So did you get him off? Oh, he got a stiff fine, but he said there's no hard feelings. Okay okay. So why don't we talk about your style. You have a very unusual style for an attorney. You talk about my clothes? - Actually your hair. - Yes, I took a Viagra. It went straight to my head. But you see, the reason I dress like this is because I have a second career. After I passed the bar, I started singing in them. I'm on my coming out tour right now. - We know that. - And then I'm going straight to where the big money is. I'm going straight to my retirement tour just like my idol, Cher. Oh, no no no. Not that chair. That's way too modern. I meant the antique Cher. Terry: Okay. ♪ Do you believe in life after love? ♪ ♪ I can feel something inside me say ♪ ♪ I really don't think you're strong enough, no ♪ ♪ do you believe in life after love? ♪ ♪ I can feel something inside me say ♪ ♪ I really don't think you're strong enough, no. ♪ Wow. She looks much better than I remember. She must have had a "Cher lift." So is Cher your favorite? No, actually there is one icon who I consider to be the queen of divas. The queen of divas? No, it's not Elton John. - It's Barbara! - Of course. ♪ Don't tell me not to live ♪ ♪ just sit and putter ♪ life's candy and the sun's ♪ ♪ a ball of butter ♪ don't bring around a cloud ♪ to rain on my parade ♪ I'll march my band ♪ I'll beat my drum ♪ and if I'm fanned out ♪ your turn at bat, sir ♪ at least I didn't fake it ♪ hat, sir ♪ guess I didn't make it ♪ get ready for me, love, 'cause I'm a comer ♪ ♪ I simply got to march, my heart's a drummer ♪ ♪ don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade! ♪ Don't forget to come out and see my show.

We've come to a special part of the show where I like to recognize some very special people.

I want you to know I wrote that song for our heroes that we have all over the world and here tonight. And I also want you to know that the proceeds from that song are going to our wounded warriors. So thank you for supporting that song. Now. Now comes a time when I have to ask you a question: Are you enjoying the show tonight? I'm so glad to hear it. Now what about... This guy right here in the third row in the blue shirt. Are you enjoying my show tonight, sir? You are? You are definitely? Okay. That's great. Isn't-- that's great. Stand up for me for a second, sir. Isn't life funny? I mean, one minute you're sitting out there enjoying my show, and the next minute you're on stage in my show. Give this guy some encouragement. Come this way, sir. Come this way. What I want you to do is go right-- no, don't come up there, go through there through those doors right there, okay? They're gonna take you an easier way on stage. Now this lady that's with him, this lady that's with him. What is your-- are you married to him? - Yes. - You are. Okay, what's your name, ma'am? - Paula. - Paula. Nice to meet you, Paula. What's his name? - Drew. - Drew and Paula. Where are you from, Paula? - Detroit. - Detroit, okay. Well thanks. You came out to Vegas to get away from all that Detroit heat. That's what I figured. Now how long have you and drew been married, Paula? - Eight years. - Eight years? Well, thanks for coming out. Did you guys come out for a special occasion? We came out with some friends. Just came out with some friends. Well, thank you so much for making the Terry fator show a part of your trip here. Now drew had no idea I was gonna pick him tonight. So here's what I need you to do. He might be a little shy, so do me a favor-- "no way." Okay. That's what-- Paula says, "no way." So do me a favor. When drew comes out here, please cheer really really loud for him so that he feels very comfortable up here on stage. From Detroit, Michigan, ladies and gentlemen, give it up for drew right here. All right. Thank you so much, drew. It's very nice to meet you. Thank you for doing this. Now what's about to happen is I'm gonna turn you into a puppet. And since you've been married for eight years, you already know what this feels like so it's not gonna be a big shock to you. So do me a favor. Turn around. Taylor's gonna outfit you in a mask. This mask is gonna allow me the ability to take over drew's ability to talk. Now, Paula, I'm gonna show you how easy it is to do this. All you need to make him talk is one of these right here. Okay. Now drew, I'm gonna ask you some questions. You don't have to say anything. I'll do all the talking. All we want you to do is nod or shake your head no. Don't look at me, look at the audience so they can see your beautiful face. So... You can tell by this reaction that you look really good. So now. First of all-- first of all, is this mask really comfortable, drew? Yes, it is, Terry. Good. That's important. We want you to be comfortable up here. - How are you doing, drew? - Terry, I'm not too good. I cut myself shaving a little earlier. Terry: Wait wait. I have had only seven scandals in my entire life. Now drew! You can't sit here and tell these jokes. Your wife Paula is sitting out there. Do you have something special you want to say to Paula? - Oh, you bet I do. - Okay. What would you like to say? Paula, honey, we've been married for eight years. - Yeah. - Three of the happiest years of my life. Wait, what? Now surely you can do better than that. Would you like to say something else to her? - You bet I would. - Okay. What else do you what to say? From now on, honey, you get to keep the remote control. I am sick of sports and I can't get enough Dr. Phil. Terry: Well that's very nice of you, drew. Okay. Now drew, now we're gonna get personal. Is there a special secret wish? Something you have never told anyone, not even your wife Paula-- let me finish the question, drew-- that you would like to get off your chest and share with this crowd tonight? Actually, Terry, yeah there is. I figured there was. What is that special wish? Terry, there's something I've wanted ever since I was a little bitty boy. Something every red-blooded American boy has always wanted. Wow. What is that, drew? My greatest wish, Terry. My greatest dream... Has always been... To be Dolly parton. - Oh really? - Yeah. Wow. Well, that's-- that's very unusual. But it's amazing because we can help you make your wish come true. Terry, if you did that, this would be the best trip to Vegas ever! Okay, we can do it. We can do it. We can do it, drew. Now drew, in order to do this we do have to put a dress on you. Is that okay with you? Don't ask, don't tell. Okay, we won't. Just turn around. Turn around. I gotta tell you, drew's talking under that mask. You people can't hear him, but I can. On the plus side, I think I learned some Detroit cuss words, so that's very helpful. So anyway, ladies and gentlemen, I give you the one and only miss Dolly parton right here. There she is. Wow. - How you doing? - Feels good to have hair again. Good! I'm glad you like that part, drew. You know, you look really comfortable. Terry, I do this all the time when Paula's not around. Okay, well... She probably needed to know that, drew. Now drew, there is a couple of things missing from this outfit. Yell them right out. What's missing? Come on. Thank you, Taylor. There they are. Oh yeah. These are real. Whatever you say. Whatever you say. Now drew, we're gonna do a duet. I'm gonna sing like rod Stewart-- okay. Can I sing like Dolly parton? Yes, you can. Now when you start singing as Dolly, I want you to do me a favor. I want you to dance. This crowd's gonna go crazy when you start dancing, drew. Okay, show them how Dolly would sing it, drew! ♪ I really can't stay ♪ baby, it's cold outside ♪ I've got to go away ♪ baby, it's cold outside ♪ this evening has been ♪ so very nice ♪ I hold your hands ♪ they're just like ice ♪ my mother will start to worry ♪ ♪ you're beautiful ♪ and my father will be pacing the floor ♪ ♪ listen to that fireplace roar ♪ ♪ really, I'd better scurry ♪ ♪ baby, what's your hurry? ♪ Well maybe just a half a drink more ♪ ♪ put some records on while I pour ♪ ♪ I can't stay ♪ baby, don't hold out ♪ baby, it's cold ♪ outside ♪ just give me five minutes more. ♪ Give it up for drew, ladies and gentlemen. Drew! Drew! You are not gonna believe what he just said as he was-- As she's taking the dress off, he goes, "if my wife takes the remote control when I get home, you're going down." Oh man. Was he good or what? Was he perfect? Now I promise you he had no idea-- he had no idea that I was gonna do that. So you know what? He's gonna come walking through these doors in a moment. Now when drew walks through those doors, I need you to do me a huge favor. I want you to treat him like a rock star. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, drew! Thank you, drew. All right, drew. I have to tell you, drew. Listen, I'll tell you something. I-- I told everybody you had no idea I was gonna do that. And I promise you Paula did not set you up. Nobody set you up. Here's how I do this. Every single night as I'm performing, I scan my crowd. I do my best to locate someone who's gonna look good in that dress. Bingo. Thank you so very much, drew. Thank you, Paula. Give them a hand. What a great job. Okay, now we've come to a special part of the show where this little guy here-- here we go. Let's see here. Right here. Isn't he adorable? Look at him. This little guy is gonna go to the oldest veteran we have in the audience. So if you're a veteran and you're old-- no wait. If you think you qualify for this, start yelling ages out here. - 80? - 86. 86? Can anybody beat 86? 87? 89? Okay, no? 86. My goodness gracious. Oh, I think that's gonna be our winner. So can you bring this back to that gentleman over there that served in the civil war? Thank you so much. Thank you for your service, my friend. Thank you. Wow. See, what I'm actually doing is I'm stalling because normally Winston the impersonating turtle helps me end the show, and he quit earlier. So... oh! Okay. Here's how we're gonna end the show-- - Winston: Terry. - Wait. That sounded like Winston the impersonating turtle. Winston, was that you? - Winston: Yes. - What is it? Can I come back? Is it okay if Winston comes back? Ladies and gentlemen, Winston the impersonating turtle. He's coming back! Winston, buddy, I gotta tell you I'm so glad you're back. What, are you giving my kids away? What? Oh... Uh, anyway. I'm so glad you're back. Honestly, Winston, I didn't think I even wanted to keep doing shows without you. Oh, Terry. You know, I got out there to the strip and at first it was a lot of fun. Yeah, we saw the pictures. - You did? - Yeah. - Oh. - What happened? After a little while, I just got lonely. Yeah, it was awful! Yeah, I bet it was. Okay. Terry, if you'll take me back, you don't even have to give me a raise. - I don't? - No. What do you think? Should I take him back? Okay okay. - Winston, guess what? - What? Not only am I gonna take you back, I'll go ahead and give you a raise too. Terry, guess what? - What? - I'm going to let you. Okay. - So I have to ask-- - no, can I say something first? What do you want to say? I want each and every one of you to know that... I love you. - Thank you. - Woman: I love you too! Was that you? Was that you? No. That's people in the audience. It's not me. All right. Anyway. You're really good. No, that was not me. I'm telling you. That was actually people yelling. - I'm so confused. - So am I. So anyway. So I have to ask. You said it was lonely out there? Oh, you have no idea. Did anything good happen while you were wandering around out there on the strip? Yeah, I got about 200 of these really cool cards they're handing out on the corners. - You want to see one? - No, I don't. No, Terry, there's one you have to see. - Really? - Yeah. Okay, fine. Show it to me. Walter: I have only had eight scandals in my entire life. Well, I guess now that you're back, Winston, you can help me sing the last song. I don't think I can, Terry. Why not? I have a frog in my throat. - Really? - Yeah. Hi-ho.
