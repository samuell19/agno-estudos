THE MOB'S GONNA BE RUNNING A MARKET STRADDLE WITH COLOMBIAN MONEY. [ Man #2 ] SO WE'RE TALKING, UH, 90-DAY TURNAROUND. [ Man #1 ] YOU THINK THE COLOMBIANS ARE GONNA LET THEIR MONEY SIT THAT LONG ? NO WAY. THESE GUYS ARE NOT KNOWN FOR THEIR PATIENCE. THEY'RE SITTIN' ON IT ANYWAY. DEPENDS ON HOW CONFIDENT THEY ARE IN THEIR PLAYERS. I JUST DON'T SEE FULVIO NESSTRA BEING POINT GUARD ON THIS. HE'S STRICTLY MUSCLE. DEMENTED MUSCLE. THE GUY'S THE JEFFREY DAHMER OF HIT MEN. LOOK, FULVIO'S MARRIED TO CARMINE MINNETTI'S DAUGHTER. HE'S GETTING HIS SHOT. -THEY'RE HOLDING SOMETHING BACK. -WHAT KIND OF NUMBERS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE ? THE VAILLARS HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST CASH RESERVES OF ANY OF THE OLD CARTELS. VERY CONSERVATIVE, I'D SAY WE'RE LOOKING UPWARDS OF HALF A BILLION. THAT LEAVES US IN A TRICKY POSITION. DO WE GO FOR THE BUST, OR DO WE LOOK TO BREAK THE VAILLAR BANK ? BOTH. KEEP THIS OPERATION GOING, COLLECTING NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS AND INDICTABLES. I'LL GET ON INTERNATIONAL. GENE, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GET A HEAD START ON, UH-- - I'M NOT DOING EYEBALLS. GIVE IT TO LIZZIE. - NO FUCKING WAY ! NO FUCKING WAY ? YOU HAVEN'T BEEN OFF YOUR ASS IN SIX MONTHS. HEY, HEY, HEY. WE'LL GET THE KID FROM K-10. JESUS CHRIST, YOU GUYS. - EXCUSE ME. - CHRIS, YOU WANNA GET DAVE JUNIPER UP HERE ? EXCUSE ME ! I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE ONLY PERSON... WHO ACTUALLY KNOWS ABOUT THIS OPERATION. FIRST OF ALL, THERE'S NO WAY TO BREAK THE VAILLAR BANK. THE MONEY'LL BE LAUNDERED AND DISPERSED IN NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS EVERY 15 TO 90 DAYS. SECONDLY, WHEN THIS KIND OF MONEY STARTS CHANGING HANDS, BODIES ARE GONNA START DROPPING LIKE STOCK TIPS. THIRDLY, IN CASE YOU PEOPLE MISSED SOMETHING, THE BAD GUYS KNOW ! SOMEBODY BLEW US IN. THEY LAID ME AND JOSH OUT... ON SILVER SERVICE PLATTERS AND SHOVED UZIS UP OUR ASSES. I THOUGHT I WAS A FUCKING CORNISH GAME HEN AT MARTHA STEWART'S HOUSE ! CHARLIE, THEY'RE ALL DEAD. THE BAD GUYS HAVE ALL BEEN KILLED. - DIDN'T GET WARREN GANZA. HE'S STILL OUT THERE ! - WARREN'S A "YES MAN." HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY CREDIBILITY OR CONNECTIONS. ALL THE PLAYERS BELONG TO YOU NOW, CHARLIE. [ Sighs, Groans ] OKAY, OKAY. I'M ON THE PAYROLL. BUT THERE'S NO TEAM. NO EYEBALLS, NO SOUND, NO CHERRY-PICKERS. AND DON'T LET ME SEE ANYBODY PEEKING ! ALL I WANT OUT OF THIS IS THE OCEAN VIEW. [ Door Closing ] HE'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT. YOU DON'T KNOW THIS GUY, WHAT HE HAS IN HIM. ON HIS WORST DAY, HE'S GOT MAGIC YOU WOULDN'T SEE IN VEGAS. BESIDES, I DON'T SEE AS WE HAVE ANY OTHER CHOICES. YOU'RE RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW HIM. I KNOW HE'S A LEGEND IN THE D.E.A., AND I RESPECT WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT HIM. BUT HE LET THAT WHOLE MIAMI OPERATION GO TO SHIT. GOT A MAN KILLED. I'M NOT SAYING, "PULL HIM," BUT WE GODDAMN WELL BETTER HAVE A CONTINGENCY PLAN... IF HE STARTS SEEING GHOSTS. HE'LL HOLD IT TOGETHER LONG ENOUGH TO GET US A BUST. HE'LL DO IT ON INSTINCT. CHARLES MAYO ? IT'S "MAY-OH." "MAY-OH." RIGHT. I'M DAVE JUNIPER. I'VE BEEN ASSIGNED AS YOUR BACKUP, AND I JUST WANNA TELL YOU... HOW REVVED I AM TO BE WORKING WITH YOU. I MEAN, YOU'RE ONE OF MY HEROES. WHO ARE YOUR OTHER HEROES ? KEITH RICHARDS. REMEMBER: NEVER LET ME SEE YOU. [ Gunshot ] [ Groans ] [ Gunshot ] [ Charlie ] DIDN'T GET WARREN GANZA. HE'S STILL OUT THERE. [ Sighs ] OH, GEEZ. [ Groans ] NOT AGAIN ! OH, JESUS. [ Belt Unfastening ] [ Banging ] OH, GOD. [ Groaning ] GOD. [ Groaning ] [ Charlie ] I WANNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE JOB. THIS IS ALL CONFIDENTIAL, RIGHT ? YEAH. WELL. LOOK, I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE, AND, UH, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW I'M NOT INTO SEARCHING FOR MY INNER CHILD... OR FINDING OUT ABOUT MY DISAPPOINTMENT IN MY MOTHER. OKAY ? OF COURSE. I MEAN, I REALLY DON'T GIVE A SHIT IF MOMMY WAS LACKING. I DON'T KNOW WHY, BUT I JUST FOUND MYSELF SAYING, "MOMMY, MOMMY, MOMMY," OVER AND OVER AGAIN, YOU KNOW ? IT JUST WAS-- I DON'T KNOW. GO AHEAD AND WIPE YOUR EYES. ANYWAY-- CHARLES, OUR TIME IS UP, BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD COME IN AGAIN TOMORROW. OUR TIME'S UP ? I JUST STARTED. WE'VE DONE TWO HOURS. - I CAN'T GO ANY LONGER. - PLEASE, DOCTOR. THIS IS REALLY HELPING ME. - I'LL PAY YOU ANYTHING. - BELIEVE ME, I WOULD STAY, BUT I'VE GOT GROUP THERAPY SESSION THAT STARTS IN A FEW MINUTES. I JUST CAN'T TURN AWAY FOUR OTHER PATIENTS. YEAH. SURE. [ Sighs Deeply ] THANK YOU. CHARLES, WHY DON'T YOU STAY FOR THE GROUP THERAPY ? NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. I-- [ Chuckles ] I REALLY CANNOT SHARE. FROM WHAT I COULD SEE, YOU NEED TO SHARE MORE THAN ANYONE I KNOW. YOU'RE IN A NEW CITY IN AN UNTENABLE SITUATION. YOU'RE SUFFERING FROM ALIENATION AND A POST-TRAUMATIC DISORDER. BELIEVE ME, MY FRIEND, YOU NEED THE SUPPORT. [ Sighs ] [ Man ] EVERYBODY IN THE BUILDING KNOWS IT'S AGAINST MY NATURE... TO HAVE A CONFRONTATION OVER SOMETHING LIKE THIS-- AND WHY SHOULD I ? THE RESULT IS JUST GONNA BE THIS MOCK INNOCENCE THAT MARGINALIZES MY NEEDS. I ASK HER SOMETHING VERY SIMPLE: "WOULD YOU PLEASE NOT BUY ANY MORE WALTON ICE CREAM ?" I REALLY FIND IT CHEMICAL-TASTING. AND SURE ENOUGH, FOR DESSERT, SHE'S SERVING WALTON ICE CREAM ! IT USUALLY HAPPENS WHEN IT'S REALLY QUIET, LIKE AT A BUSINESS MEETING OR AT A DINNER. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, I-- I FEEL THIS PRESSURE BUILDING. WHEN I DO GOOD THINGS, I GET PUNISHED. AND WHEN I DO BAD THINGS, I GET REWARDED. [ Man ] I'VE CHAIRED THAT MEETING FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS. AND THEN TO ALL OF A SUDDEN COME BACK AND HAVE KRAMER CHAIR ? - I DON'T COUNT. - ...URGE TO SCREAM. - THE BAD GUYS ALWAYS WIN. - IT'S LIKE CORPORATE TOURETTE'S. - IT'S HUMILIATING ! - AM I NOT A PERSON ? [ People Chattering Together ] MIGHT AS WELL BE BUCK NAKED WITH A FEATHER STICKING OUT MY ASS ! I'M OVERWHELMED WITH THIS URGE TO DO SOMETHING TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE. AND I SIT THERE AND I TELL MYSELF, "IF YOU ERUPT, IT WILL DESTROY YOUR LIFE." BUT THAT JUST MAKES THE PRESSURE INCREASE. WHAT DO YOU DO ? FIRST I HOLD MY TONGUE FIRMLY BETWEEN MY TEETH. LIKE THIS. AND THEN I PUSH MY CHIN UP. [ Chuckles ] BUT THAT STARTS TO HURT, SO-- THEN I JUST BITE THE HEEL OF MY HAND. - DOES THAT WORK ? - SO FAR. YOU KNOW HOW WE ALL HAVE THIS WAY WE WANT LIFE TO BE, RIGHT ? WE ALL SAY PEOPLE GET WHAT'S COMING TO THEM IN THE END. I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT. DO YOU THINK THAT'S REALLY TRUE, HOWARD ? OR DO YOU THINK THAT'S A PERCEPTION ? I REALLY HATE WHEN YOU USE THAT PATRONIZING TONE WITH ME. I HATE THAT. I MEAN, IF WE'RE IN HELL AS A FACT OF LIFE, OKAY, AND I SAY, "HEY, IT'S A LITTLE HOT IN HERE," WHY AM I CALLED NEGATIVE ? - NOBODY CALLED YOU NEGATIVE, HOWARD. - YEAH, YOU DID. - YOU DIDN'T, BUT YOU DID. - NO, I SIMPLY ASKED... IF IT COULD JUST BE THE WAY YOU'RE PERCEIVING THINGS. EVERYTHING IS JUST THE WAY WE PERCEIVE THINGS. MY PERCEPTION OF LIFE IS WHO I AM-- IT'S ME ! IT'S MY EXPRESSION, OKAY ? AND I PERCEIVE THAT EVERY PLACE I LOOK, THE BAD GUYS ALWAYS WIN. - NEXT WEEK WE SHOULD SPEND THE WHOLE SESSION ON THAT. - OH, SO I'M THIS BURDEN NOW. - AND I'M SUPPOSED TO FEEL GUILTY ABOUT THAT ? - NOBODY CALLED YOU A BURDEN. BUT I JUST HAVE ANOTHER 20 MINUTES LEFT, AND I'D JUST LIKE TO GIVE CHARLES A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES... HE'S BEEN WRESTLING WITH SINCE HE CAME TO NEW YORK, ALL RIGHT ? - ABSOLUTELY. CHARLES ? - CHARLES. UH, WELL, UM-- [ Sighs ] I REALLY HATE WATERMELON. I GUESS MY MAIN ISSUES REALLY COME FROM MY JOB. - WHERE ELSE, RIGHT ? - H'M. - [ Chuckles ] - I MEAN, IT WAS ALWAYS TOUGH WORK, AND, I DON'T KNOW, I THOUGHT I HAD A HANDLE ON IT, BUT... [ Chuckles ] THIS LAST DEAL-- [ Sighs ] I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU DO ? CHEEMO PARTEL STARTS SINGING TO ME. THEN HE SHOVES A GUN IN MY PARTNER'S ASS AND BLOWS HIM AWAY. THEY TOSS HIM OUT THE WINDOW. THEY GRAB ME. THEY THROW ME ONTO THIS SERVING PLATTER. MY FACE IS STUCK IN THIS... MUSHY WATERMELON-- THE SMELL WAS JUST SICKENING. AND NOW CHEEMO STARTS GETTING REALLY CRAZY, HUMMING THESE SHOW TUNES... AND STICKING THIS NINE MILLIMETER IN MY FACE. AND JUST BEFORE HE BLOWS MY HEAD OFF, THE DIPSHIT SURVEILLANCE TEAM SHOW UP... AND KILL EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM, AND-- I DON'T KNOW, I'VE BEEN A BIT JITTERY EVER SINCE. BUT THE BIG THING IS THESE NIGHTMARES I'M HAVING. OKAY, THE GUY I'M SUPPOSED TO BE IN BED WITH ON THIS, FULVIO NESSTRA, HE'S A TOTAL PSYCHO. AND EVERY TIME I CLOSE MY EYES, I CAN SEE HIS FACE, EVEN THOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE, BUT... I CAN SEE HIS EYES BURNING THROUGH ME. KNOWING WHAT I'M THINKING. KNOWING I'M A LIAR. [ Man ] YOU'RE A LIAR. DID YOU REALLY THINK YOU COULD STEAL FROM ME ? - YOU THINK I WOULDN'T NOTICE ? - I DIDN'T STEAL. I SWEAR, FULVIO. LARRY, JUST ADMIT IT. YOU'LL FEEL SO MUCH BETTER, LIKE A BIG WEIGHT'S BEEN LIFTED FROM YOUR SHOULDERS. - I SWEAR ON THE LIFE OF MY CHILDREN-- - SHUT UP ! LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ARABS ? I REALLY, UH-- I REALLY DON'T GET THEM. I THINK WE SHOULD JUST-- JUST BOMB THE WHOLE MIDDLE EAST. THAT'S A TYPICALLY BIGOTED RESPONSE TO A CULTURE YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. YOU KNOW, IN SAUDI ARABIA, YOU CAN LEAVE A MILLION CASH ON THE TABLE. COME BACK TWO DAYS LATER, IT'S STILL THERE-- YOU KNOW WHY ? I-- I-- I GUESS THEY'RE VERY HONEST PEOPLE ? THEY'RE NO BETTER THAN AMERICANS. BUT THEY HAVE RESPECT FOR THE LAW. IN THE ISLAMIC WORLD, YOU STEAL, THEY CUT YOUR FUCKIN' HAND OFF. I DIDN'T-- I DIDN'T TAKE ANY-- PUT YOUR HAND ON THE TABLE. PLEASE, IT'S JUST A-- DOESN'T MATTER WHAT IT IS. WITHOUT RESPECT FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY, WITHOUT OBEDIENCE TO THE LAW, WE ARE NO MORE THAN ANIMALS. PUT YOUR HAND ON THE TABLE. I WON'T SAY IT AGAIN. THERE'S YOUR FUCKING PAPER. LET THE NEIGHBOR GO. - SPORTS PAGE THERE ? - YEAH, THE FUCKIN' SPORTS PAGE IS THERE. - HOW'S THE NEW KITCHEN TILE, LAR ? - LOOKS REALLY NICE. GOOD. TELL BARBARA TO CALL ME, ALL RIGHT ? GO CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES. YOU WENT OUT AND GOT A NEW PAPER, DIDN'T YOU ? I DIDN'T GET SHIT. IT WAS BEHIND THE FUCKIN' GARBAGE CAN. YOU'RE LYING. I CAN READ YOUR EYES. YOU'RE CALLIN' ME A FUCKIN' LIAR, FULVIO ? I CRAWL BEHIND THE GARBAGE CANS TO FIND YOUR LOUSY SPORTS PAGE, AND YOU CALL ME A FUCKIN' LIAR. NO. YEAH. [ Gasping ] I AIN'T CALLING YOU A LIAR, HONEY. I'M SAYING YOU GOT A BIG HEART. UH-HUH. YOU JUST SAVED THIS SPORTS-PAGE-THIEVING SACK OF SHIT... FROM GETTING HIS HAND CHOPPED OFF. YEAH. LARRY, YOU GOING TO THE CITY ? CAN I GET A RIDE FROM YOU ? MY CAR'S IN THE SHOP. FINE. CHARLES ! WHAT DO YOU THINK ? [ Chuckles ] I GET DIZZY ON A THICK CARPET. - [ Laughing ] I'M THINKING OF BUYING IT. - IT MAKES THE WRONG STATEMENT. ESTUVIO HATES IT. COME ON. LET'S TALK. I WAS VERY UPSET WHEN I HEARD ABOUT CHEEMO'S DEATH. IT WAS A BAD SITUATION. ARE WE STILL IN BUSINESS ? OF COURSE WE ARE. BECAUSE I HEARD THE FEDS WERE IN ON THE DROP. THERE WERE NO FEDS. IT WAS WARREN GANZA. HE WANTED IN ON THIS AND IT WAS BETWEEN CHEEMO AND ME. WARREN CAME IN SHOOTING-- NO NEGOTIATIONS. NOBODY STOOD A CHANCE. IS HE GONNA MAKE TROUBLE HERE ? NO. I TOLD YOU ONCE BEFORE, MY FAMILY IS NO LONGER... INTO THAT WILD, COLOMBIAN COWBOY SHIT. WE NEED TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE, AND MY FATHER'S COUNTING ON ME. I NEED TO LOOK GOOD. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT I LOOK GOOD. WE'RE HERE TO INVEST IN THE COMMODITIES MARKET, AND I GUARANTEE YOU WILL LOOK GREAT. WARREN GANZA IS MY PROBLEM. HE WILL BE DEALT WITH. THIS GUY, HE'S HAVING AN '82 MARGAUX WITH TUNA FISH. WHAT A POSER. JASON, CAN WE JUST DO THIS, PLEASE ? YOU GOTTA TRY THE FINGER POTATOES. WITH SALMON AND CREME FRAICHE-- I'M TELLING YOU, FULVIO, TONGUE BONER ! - I ALREADY ATE. I JUST WANT COFFEE. - YOU GOTTA TRY THE POTATOES. - I DON'T WANT FINGER POTATOES. - BRING HIM A PLATE. - I'M TELLING YOU MY ORDER. I WANT COFFEE, MILK, TWO SUGARS. BRING ME ANY WEIRD-LOOKIN' POTATOES, I'LL KILL YOU BOTH. I WANT MY COFFEE HOT. SHUT UP ! FULVIO-- JASON, THIS IS ALL ABOUT BUSINESS. YEAH. WE'RE NOT GETTING INTO BONDING HERE. WE'RE NOT GETTING INTO WEIRD FUCKING VEGETABLES. YOU GOT IT ? WE GOT A MEETING TONIGHT WITH SOME HEAVY HITTERS. CAN YOU FOCUS ON THAT ? YUP, FOCUS. HEAVY HITTING. THAT'S WHAT I DO. GOOD, BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT COUNTRY CLUB BOYS FROM SCARSDALE WE'RE DEALING WITH. EVEN THOUGH WE DO OWN THAT TOWN. WE'RE DEALING WITH TWO OF THE TOUGHEST MOBS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. YOU GOTTA STOP ACTING LIKE SUCH A YUPPIE HARD-ON. NO-- JUST KEEP IT DOWN TO BUSINESS TONIGHT. DON'T TRY TO BE A BIG ASSHOLE WHO ORDERS FOOD FOR EVERYBODY. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. I'M JUST TRYING TO BE A GOOD HOST. HAVING A LITTLE FUN WITH MY LIFE. - WH-WHAT'S WRONG WITH FUN ? - FUN IS OVERRATED. OKAY, SO SLOW DOWN. JUST TAKE A MOMENT. TAKE A MOMENT ? YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. I DON'T THINK I CAN GO THROUGH WITH THIS TONIGHT. HE'S GONNA LOOK IN MY EYES AND KNOW. THEN CANCEL THE MEETING. YOU THINK I'VE GOT SOME KIND OF REAL JOB, WHERE YOU CAN JUST HAVE YOUR SECRETARY CALL AND RESCHEDULE ? OKAY. TAKE A DEEP BREATH. TRY AND CALM DOWN. YOU'RE HAVING A SMALL ANXIETY ATTACK. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A STRONGER PRESCRIPTION TO TAKE THE EDGE OFF. ONLY TAKE ONE OF THESE ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THE MEETING. YOU DON'T WANT TO PASS OUT. THEN I WANT YOU TO CALL THIS GASTROENTEROLOGIST. NOTHING IMPEDES THERAPY LIKE ACUTE, INTERMITTENT FLATULENCE. [ Bowels Rumbling ] IT'S NOT HAPPENING. IT'S NOT HAPPENING. AW, COME ON, COME ON. WHERE IS IT ? WHERE'S THAT GOOD, HAPPY FEELING ?

I DON'T KNOW WHO TOLD YOU THAT OUR BUSINESS TOGETHER GIVES YOU A LICENSE TO ACT... LIKE A COMPLETE SHIT-FOR-BRAINS, BUT THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR MAKES ME VERY, VERY UNEASY. NOW, WE'RE HERE TO DO ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY: TO GO OVER THE ARRANGEMENTS... - AND GO THE FUCK HOME. - FIDEL, ARE THESE YOUR KIDS ? YEAH. THOSE ARE MY CHILDREN. THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL. HOW COME YOU NEVER SHOWED ME THEIR PICTURES BEFORE ? [ Charlie Chuckling ] I JUST NEVER GOT AROUND TO IT. - I'M TRYING TO MAKE A POINT. - [ Jason ] THOSE KIDS ARE STUNNING. LOOK AT THAT. THESE ARE THE FACES THAT CAN CHANGE A MAN'S LIFE. YOU'RE VERY LUCKY. - LOOK AT THAT LOOK. - WHO'S THIS ? THAT'S ESMERALDA. SHE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE HER MOTHER. THAT REALLY-- IF YOU TURN IT, IT'S A GROUP SHOT. - [ Charlie Chuckling ] - [ Jason ] LOOK, FIDEL. I CAN SEE WHY... YOU DIDN'T WANT ME TO BRING IN ANY WOMEN. YOU'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY, AND I RESPECT THAT. I WAS JUST TRYING TO SHOW EVERYBODY A GOOD TIME. [ Chuckles ] I'M JUST A HARD-ON. I'M-- I'M SORRY. NO, IT'S OKAY, JASON. YOU KNOW WHAT ? I THINK I WAS BEING TOO UPTIGHT. TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO THIS WHOLE... COLOMBIAN COKE-DEALER STEREOTYPE, AND IT PREVENTS ME FROM LOOSENING UP ! I TELL YOU, MY WIFE TELLS ME I GOTTA LIGHTEN UP A BIT. SO, FUCK IT, BRING ON YOUR PARTY. SERIOUSLY. NO, NO, NO, NO. NO, NO, NO, NO. NO, I INSIST. NO. NO ! IT'S BUSINESS FIRST, AND THEN WE'LL PARTY. OKAY ? ALL RIGHT. LET ME GO THROUGH THE GAME PLAN. YOU EVER HEAR OF A MARKET STRADDLE ? SURE. ALL RIGHT, THAT'S BASICALLY IT. I'M GONNA LAUNDER YOUR MONEY BY PLAYING COMMODITIES FUTURES.

REMEMBER, WE'RE LETTIN' YOU RUN WITH THIS BECAUSE WE'RE RISKING NO MONEY. - OH, LISTEN, POP-- - HOLD IT. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU NOT TO CALL ME POP ? NOT DAD, NOT PADRE, NOT PATER. NONE OF THOSE WORDS THAT ELEVATE YOU ABOVE SON-IN-LAW. I HAD ONE SON, AND HE KILLED HIMSELF. I'M SORRY, DON CARMINE-- SHUT UP ! YOU KNOW ABOUT MY SON ? HE WAS A FINOCCH'. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS ? HE WAS A FAG. HE CAME TO ME ONE NIGHT AND TOLD ME HE WAS A HOMOSEXUAL. A FUCKIN' CIGAR SMOKER. DO YOU KNOW HOW I FELT ? I THREW HIM OUT OF THE FUCKIN' HOUSE ! I REJECTED HIM. I LOVED HIM MORE THAN I LOVED BREATHING ! AT HIS FUNERAL, I CRIED LIKE A LITTLE BABY. NO ONE DARED TO COME NEAR ME, EXCEPT ONE PERSON. HE CAME OVER TO ME AND HE LEANED MY HEAD ON HIS SHOULDER. TOGETHER WE MOURNED. I HAD A DEEPLY BONDING MOMENT WITH LEON, MY SON'S MOOLEY HAIRDRESSER BOYFRIEND FROM SPANISH FUCKIN' HARLEM. MY BEAUTIFUL SON IS DEAD.

PUT ON YOUR PANTS. * [ Salsa ] [ Judy ] HOW ARE YOU FEELIN' ? FINE. OH, AND SO CHIPPER TOO. WHAT DID HE PRESCRIBE FOR YOU ? OH, I DON'T KNOW. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING ? YOU INGEST THAT CRAP, AND IN SIX MONTHS... WE'LL BE FITTING YOU FOR A COLOSTOMY BAG. YOU ARE A DERANGED LADY. WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP THE CAR AND LET ME OUT ? WHY AM I DERANGED ? BECAUSE I DON'T TAKE THE ORTHODOX VIEW OF HEALING ? [ Horn Blasting ] - YOU DON'T TAKE AN ORTHODOX VIEW OF DRIVING EITHER. - NICE REFLEXES. YOU CLEARLY DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT DRUGS, OKAY ? THEY'RE KILLERS. I BET I CAN ALLEVIATE YOUR STOMACH PAINS IN TWO WEEKS. IN A MONTH, I'LL HAVE 'EM CURED. NO CHEMICALS INVOLVED. - YOU THINK SO, HUH ? - YOU THINK I'M JUST A NUT ? YEAH. AH. BUT AM I AN ATTRACTIVE NUT ? - EXTREMELY. - SO COME ON, IT'S TWO WEEKS. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE ? I CAN'T. OH, PLEASE. HEY, I CAN MAKE A BETTER DIAGNOSIS THAN THAT DOCTOR I WORK FOR. YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU ? SURE. FEAR. I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR EYES. YOU'RE CONSUMED WITH TERROR, AND IT'S EATING YOU ALIVE. AND IF YOU DON'T GET IT UNDER CONTROL, YOU'RE GONNA SHIT YOURSELF TO DEATH. OKAY, WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND ? WELL, I COULD TAKE YOU FOR AN HERBAL HAPPY HOUR AND LIBIDO-BUILDING HEALTH FOOD. I'M TEMPTED. GOOD DEAL. YOU'RE ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY. FOR ME, THE SINGLE MOST UNBEARABLE POINT IS HAVING MY LIFE CONTROLLED... BY A BUNCH OF IDIOTS WHO I DESPISE. I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO RUN MY OWN LIFE. - WHY DO YOU FEEL YOU HAVE NO CONTROL OVER YOUR LIFE ? - COME ON, JEFF. HOW MANY OF US GET TO BE OUR OWN BOSSES ? WE ALL HAVE TO ANSWER TO SOME SHITHEAD, AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT UNBEARABLE. - THEN QUIT ! - TAKE A PAY CUT TO GO WORK FOR SOME OTHER EGOMANIAC, WHO ALSO HUMILIATES AND TERRORIZES YOU. WHAT IS THIS THING THAT BOSSES HAVE OVER YOU ? FEAR. THEY WORK US THROUGH FEAR. THEY KEEP US TERRIFIED OF LOSING OUR STATUS. LOSE YOUR STATUS AND YOU'RE FUCKED. WHY ARE YOU ALL SO OBSESSED WITH STATUS ? BECAUSE THAT'S YOUR ARMOR. WHAT EVERYONE THINKS OF YOU IS WHAT DETERMINES YOUR SURVIVAL. THAT'S STRANGE, COMING FROM A COP. YOU'RE ONE OF THE FEW THAT ACTUALLY HAS ARMOR. BUT I'M A NAKED COP. UNDERCOVER. JUST WAITING FOR THE MOMENT I'M DISCOVERED. - AND THEN I WON'T BE ABLE TO PULL MY GUN FAST ENOUGH. - SO WHAT'S THE ANSWER TO FEAR ? LUCK. AND RETIREMENT. - [ Chuckling ] THAT WOULD BE-- - THE HOLY FUCKING GRAIL ! LET ME-- LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING. DOCTOR, WANNA HAVE A LOOK ? OCEAN VIEWS, SERVANTS, ALL UTILITIES-- WOW ! WHAT IS THIS ?

YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A GREAT PIECE OF ASS AND THE SECRET TO ETERNAL BLISS. HOW'D YOU GUESS ? I'M YOUR MAN. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ? AH, RELAX. IT'S AN ADVENTURE. I DON'T LIKE ADVENTURES. YOU LIKE CHAMPAGNE ? IT GIVES ME GAS. WE'LL DRINK IT OUTSIDE. WOW ! THIS IS ALL YOURS ? HUH ? NO. SHOULD BE, BUT IT'S NOT. [ Popping ] GEEZ, WHAT'S THAT SMELL ? OH, MANURE. I'M MAKING A GARDEN.

SHUT THE FUCK UP ! I KNOW THE KIND OF CASH THAT'S FLOATIN' AROUND-- [ Flesh Tearing ] [ Gasps ] FUCKIN' WRONG ANSWER. LITTLE RAT SHOWED UP. YEAH, YEAH. LIKE I SAY, HE-- HE WANTED IN ON THE DEAL. WELL, I THINK WARREN MISSED THE BOAT. H'M ? WHO'S THAT ? I'LL EXPLAIN LATER. COME ON. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. CHARLIE, THE GUY'S A FED. DID YOU TAKE HIM OUT ? YEAH, HE WAS WITH WARREN. COME ON. CAR'S OVER HERE. I BET YOU WAS WONDERIN' WHAT I WAS DOIN' BACK THERE WHEN GANZA JUMPED YA. I FIGURED YOU WERE COMING TO BLOW MY HEAD OFF... AND RESENTED WARREN GETTIN' THERE FIRST. [ Chuckles ] YOU A FUNNY GUY. WELL, NOW, WHAT I WAS DOIN'-- I WAS COMIN' BY YOUR HOTEL TO BUY YOU A DRINK. TO TELL YOU, YOU DID A VERY SMOOTH JOB WITH THOSE S.E.C. BOYS THIS MORNING. NO SHIT. I COULD SEE WHY CHEEMO THOUGHT SO HIGHLY OF YA. THANKS. YOU EVER BEEN TO NEW YORK BEFORE ? PASSED THROUGH A COUPLE OF TIMES. NEVER ACTUALLY SPENT ANY TIME HERE. IT AIN'T LIKE IT USED TO BE. YOU EVER BEEN TO ITALY ? UH-UH. MOST BEAUTIFUL PLACE IN THE WHOLE WORLD. I AIN'T BEEN THERE EITHER. I GOT A LOT OF PICTURES, THOUGH. I CHANGED PLANES IN ROME ONCE. NO SHIT ? IT MUST HAVE BEEN GREAT, HUH ? THE AIRPORT WAS VERY NICE. I GOT OUT TO GET A SNACK. YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING WAS WRITTEN IN ITALIAN. I WAS STANDING IN LINE BEHIND THIS GUY WHO ORDERED SOME "CREE-CREE." I SAW THAT HE GOT A BAG OF CHIPS. SO, WHEN IT WAS MY TURN, I SAID, "CREE-CREE." GOT MY CHIPS. "CREE-CREE" ? FOR POTATO CHIPS ? NO SHIT. I GOTTA REMEMBER THAT. I THINK THEY SPELL IT... "C-R-I-S-C-R-I-S," BUT IT'S PRONOUNCED "CREE-CREE." NATCH. ALL THE LATIN LANGUAGES ARE LIKE THAT. "I" IS ALWAYS AN "E." AND YOU DROP THE LAST CONSONANT. DO ANY SOUVENIR SHOPPING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT ? YEAH. BEAUTIFUL LEATHER GOODS. YEAH. LIKE BUTTER. CHARLIE, YOU SOUND LIKE A FUCKIN' BROKEN RECORD. WE'RE NOT PULLING YOU. AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED, WITH WARREN GANZA OUT OF THE PICTURE, THIS DEAL IS CLEAR. HE KILLED JUNIPER, LONNY. NOBODY LIKES TO LOSE A BROTHER OFFICER, MAN. BUT IT GOES WITH THE JOB. WE DON'T PULL AN INVESTIGATION BECAUSE A GOOD GUY GOT KILLED. WE GO OUT AND GET THE FUCKERS ! HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET THE FUCKERS THAT KILL ME ? [ Elevator Bell Dings ] [ Door Opens, Closes ] [ Elevator Motor Whirring ] WE'RE ALL PRETTY RILED UP ABOUT JUNIPER. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT EVERY MAN AND WOMAN IN THIS DEPARTMENT... IS STANDING RIGHT BEHIND YOU. HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP ? WELL, I'LL TELL YOU, DEXTER. NOT TOO GREAT. ACTUALLY, I'M ON MY WAY TO THE TOP FLOOR JUST TO THROW MYSELF OFF. HOW'S THE VIEW UP THERE ?

I'M POPPING PILLS. I CAN'T CONTROL MY BOWELS. I'M A WRECK. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN YOU SHUT UP. WHAT DO YOU THINK ? I THINK I HAVE A GREAT PARABLE FOR THIS PROBLEM. THERE WAS THIS BUDDHIST MONK, AND HE WAS JUST WALKING THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS, WHEN OUT OF NOWHERE THIS TIGER APPEARS... AND JUST CHASES HIM TO THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF. SO THE MONK CLIMBS OVER THE SIDE, WHERE HE SEES FIFTEEN FEET BELOW HIM... FIVE OTHER TIGERS JUST WAITING TO EAT HIM. SO THE MONK IS JUST HANGING THERE, HOLDING ON TO THE LITTLE SHRUB, WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE NOTICES THE STRAWBERRY. AND HE SMILES. AND HE SAYS, "WOW ! WHAT A PERFECT STRAWBERRY." SO HE PICKS IT, AND HE EATS IT. AND ? THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT ? MM-H'M. THE MONK'S ABOUT TO BE EATEN BY TIGERS, AND HE STOPS TO EAT A STRAWBERRY. WHAT THE HELL'S IT SUPPOSED TO MEAN ? IT MEANS... WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ALIVE EVERY SECOND WE'RE ALIVE. COME ON. EVERYBODY'S ALIVE WHEN THEY'RE ALIVE. NO, NOT IF YOU'RE CONSUMED BY FEAR. COME ON. LOOK AT YOU. YOU WERE ABOUT TO BE EATEN BY TIGERS, AND TWICE THE GODS SAVED YOU. NOW, ARE YOU RUNNING AROUND GRINNING LIKE YOU'RE THE LUCKIEST GUY IN THE WORLD ? NO, YOU'RE POPPING TRANQUILIZERS AND SHITTING IN YOUR PANTS. [ Jason ] AHOY THERE ! YOU GENTLEMEN READY FOR A "DOW IS UP, LIFE IS SWEET" ALOHA CRUISE AROUND THE HARBOR ? -IT'S A LITTLE CHILLY. -WELL, JASON'S GONNA MAKE YOU FEEL ALL WARM AND FUZZY INSIDE. COME ABOARD, GENTLEMEN. COME ON, GUYS ! [ Bowels Rumbling ] CHAMPAGNE, GENTLEMEN ? OKAY. OKAY. I'M PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT THIS MORNING, TRANSCONTINENTAL INVESTMENTS ACQUIRED 800,000 CONTRACTS IN SOYBEAN FUTURES. I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST TO MY FELLOW BEAN TYCOONS. - BEANS ? - MM. YOU BOUGHT $2 MILLION WORTH OF BEANS ? THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT ? NO, I WOULD NOT PLAY WITH YOU, FIDEL. WE CURRENTLY OWN TWO PERCENT OF THE SOYBEAN MARKET. ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKIN' MIND ? DO YOU THINK I'M GONNA TELL MY FATHER... THAT I SPENT TWO MILLION OF HIS DOLLARS TO BUY FUCKIN' BEANS ? I MIGHT AS WELL SHAVE MY HEAD AND JOIN THE FUCKIN' DALAI LAMA. NO, NO, NO. DUMP IT. THEY'RE NOT BEANS. THEY'RE SOYBEANS. THEY USE IT TO MAKE TOFU. IT'S VERY TRENDY. I DON'T CARE IF THEY'RE SOY, LIMA, KIDNEY, CANNELLINI, HEINZ, FAVA OR GREAT NORTHERN, YOU DO NOT LET MY FATHER THINK FOR ONE MINUTE THAT YOU'RE CALLING HIM A BEANER. - FIDEL-- - YOU UNLOAD THE BEANS AND GIVE US BACK THE MONEY BY TOMORROW. WE'LL GET KILLED IF I TRY TO UNLOAD THIS TOMORROW. WE'LL LOSE AT LEAST 50%. WHAT ABOUT OUR END ? YOU GONNA COVER IT ? FIDEL, HE'S GOT A POINT. CHARLIE, SHUT THE FUCK UP. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE WITH ME ON THIS. GET THIS SHIT-FOR-BRAINS TO COVER YOUR END OF IT. I'M NOT TELLIN' MY DON WE'RE WASHIN' YOUR CASH FOR FREE. WELL, YOU FUCKIN' GUINEAS WANNA GO TO WAR WITH US OVER $300,000 ? COME ON. US GUINEAS ? WHAT ABOUT YOU FUCKIN' COLOMBIANS ? MINUTE YOU DON'T GET YOUR WAY, IT'S OUT WITH THE FUCKIN' UZIS-- WHOO, WHOO, WHOO. - WE CAN HANDLE THIS SHIT RIGHT NOW. - COME ON, PANCHO. LET'S GO. - COME ON. - [ Shouts, Indistinct ] - [ Muttering, Indistinct ] - STOP. STOP THIS MACHO DICK THING ! I DON'T CARE WHOSE GUINEA, MICK, PETER, COCK IS BIGGER ! I'M HERE TO MAKE MONEY ! FIDEL, NOBODY WAS LOOKING TO INSULT YOUR FAMILY. -IT WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE. RIGHT, JASON ? -I SWEAR. IT WAS THE BEST DEAL. I HAD NO IDEA THE COLOMBIANS WERE SENSITIVE TO THE BEAN ISSUE. - I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST THE MEXICANS. - THAT'S ENOUGH, JASON. DO YOU UNDERSTAND, FIDEL ? IT WAS A MISTAKE. - LOOK WHAT THIS FUCKER IS DOING TO MY PEOPLE. - FUCKING GUY WENT FOR ME. - YOU SHOT HIS BALL OFF ! - STOP. STOP THIS. - COME ON. COME ON. PLEASE. WE'LL WORK IT OUT. FIDEL-- I AM NOT TAKING BEANS TO MY FATHER ! I SAID WE'LL WORK IT OUT. BUT IF WE DO, ARE WE STILL IN BUSINESS ? ALL RIGHT. FIRST, YOU GOTTA DUMP THE BEANS. MY FATHER, HE'S OLD WORLD. HE'S VERY SENSITIVE. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. WE DON'T EVEN EAT BEANS. - NOT EVEN, LIKE, A TUSCAN BEAN SALAD ? - JASON, SHUT UP. - [ Fidel ] WHAT ? - BELIEVE ME, FIDEL. NOBODY WANTS TO INSULT YOUR FAMILY. WE WANNA MAKE YOU HAPPY. WE DUMP THE BEANS. OKAY ? OKAY. BUT THIS GUY HAS GOTTA STOP WASTING MY ASSOCIATES. YOU KNOW, I CAN'T HAVE PEOPLE COMING HOME WITH MISSING BALLS AND FUCKING CRACKED HEADS. ALL RIGHT ? DONE. FULVIO, I WANT YOU TO GET CONTROL OF THAT ANGER. WE'VE GOT MONEY TO MAKE. [ Gasping ] [ Bowels Rumbling ] - WE HAVE GOT A BIG PROBLEM. - IT'S A SMALL PROBLEM, NOTHIN' WE CAN'T HANDLE. THE YUPPIE BROKER BOUGHT INTO THE BEAN MARKET, AND NOW FIDEL'S INSULTED. DID I MISS SOMETHING ? WHY IS HE INSULTED ? FIDEL FEELS LIKE WE'RE MAKIN' FUN OF HIM BECAUSE SPICS EAT BEANS. IT'S LIKE BEING BLACK, AND HAVING SOMEBODY BUY INTO THE WATERMELON MARKET FOR YOU. I HAVE NO PROBLEM BUYING INTO OLIVE OIL. THAT'S A CULTURAL STEREOTYPE. YES, CARMINE, BUT ONLY IF YOU MAKE THAT CHOICE YOURSELF. SO VAILLAR IS READY TO BLOW THIS APART OVER A PERCEIVED INSULT ? - WE CAN HOLD THIS TOGETHER. - LET'S PUT SOME INDICTMENTS TOGETHER AND GET OUT NOW. - GET OUT NOW. - WE'VE GOT THEIR TWO MILLION. - COLOMBIANS ARE MONEY MACHINES. - TWO MILLION IS NOTHIN'. - IT'S GETTIN' TOO MESSY. WHACK THE COLOMBIAN AND KEEP HIS TWO MILL. LET'S GO FOR THE BUST NOW. THIS THING IS FALLING APART. THIS GUY CHARLIE'S REAL SMART. HE CAN HOLD THIS TOGETHER FOR A BIG PAY-OUT. THIS FULVIO'S FUCKING NUTS. THERE'S NO WAY I CAN HOLD THIS TOGETHER. WHAT DO YOU THINK ? WE STAY. - WHAT DO YOU THINK, JOEY ? - FUCK 'EM. LET'S STAY. THERE'S JUST MAYBE ONE LITTLE TINY GLITCH. CAN YOU COVER ANY LOSS WE HAVE TO MAKE UP IF JASON TAKES A BEATING IN THE MARKETPLACE ? - NO WAY. - NO CHANCE. - NO PROBLEM. - DIDN'T THINK SO. [ Knocking ] [ Knocking Continues ] YEAH, YEAH. I'M COMIN'. GREAT NEWS. CAN I COME IN ? SURE. NICE PLACE, CHARLIE. YOU TRAVEL IN STYLE. THANKS. WH-WHAT'S THE GREAT NEWS ? JASON UNLOADED THE BEANS. HOW MUCH OF A HIT DID WE TAKE ? YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE THIS: 20%. WHAT ? DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT THESE IVY LEAGUE, WALL STREET PREPPY SCUMBAGS. THEY KNOW HOW TO MOVE THE MONEY. HE PASSES OFF THE LOSSES ONTO HIS OTHER CLIENTS. [ Chuckling ] UN-FUCKING-BELIEVABLE. ISN'T IT ? HE SHOVES 'EM ALL IN ON THE DEAL. NINETY DAYS, WHEN THE OPTIONS ARE DUE, THE STUPID LITTLE BASTARDS BE DIVIN' OUT THE WINDOW. GEEZ. IT'S A FUCKIN' PALACE, CHARLIE. H'M. I TELL YOU, THAT LITTLE FUCKIN' FIDEL... BETTER BE KISSIN' OUR ASSES WITH COLOMBIAN GRATITUDE. WE SQUIRMED THROUGH THE SHIT HOOP FOR THAT LITTLE BEANO FREAK, HUH ? YEAH, WELL, I HOPE SO, BUT, YOU KNOW, FIDEL'S A-- WELL, HE'S A VERY DIFFICULT GUY TO PLEASE. TELL ME ABOUT IT. WIND CHANGES, HE GOES BAT-SHIT. NO CONTROL OVER HIS TEMPER WHATSOEVER. THAT'S TRUE. HE DOES HAVE A BAD TEMPER, BUT, YOU KNOW, I'D-- THAT'S WHY WE'VE GOT TO BE EXTRA CALM-- TO MAKE UP FOR HIS LACK OF SELF-CONTROL. I THINK WE'VE BEEN DOIN' A PRETTY GOOD JOB IN THAT DEPARTMENT. YEAH, FOR THE MOST PART, BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK HE'S STILL A LITTLE UPSET ABOUT YOU MAIMING HIS BODYGUARD. A LITTLE. CHARLIE, YOU LET A GUY MAKE FUN OF YOUR PROSTATE, WHERE ARE YA ? * [ Middle Eastern ] IT'S LIKE A TEMPLE. THAT'S THE DREAM: SURVIVE THIS INSANITY AND RETIRE TO A PURE LIFE. WOW. - [ Door Closes ] - THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT ? LET'S GO UPSTAIRS. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? - THAT'S THE GUY WHO'S GONNA KILL ME. WHERE ? [ Chattering ] [ Jason Speaking, Indistinct ] BULLSHIT. OOH. LOOK AT THIS. HUH ? HIS PARTNER'S HERE TOO. [ Mutters ] [ Salesman ] HOW DOES YOUR, UH-- IT KIND OF HURTS. WHAT'S THE MATTER ? THERE'S MORE OF THEM. THERE'S MORE OF THEM ? ARE YOU SURE ? YOU THINK I'M BEING PARANOID. THE COLOMBIAN AND HIS BODYGUARD ARE RIGHT THERE. CHARLIE, THIS IS CRAZY. LOOK. A NORMAL PERSON IN A NORMAL SITUATION, YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT CONSEQUENCES THAT THE NORMAL PERSON DOESN'T HAVE TO FACE. - IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG, I'M DEAD. - [ Judy ] YOU CAN'T SAY THAT, BECAUSE THINGS ARE CONSTANTLY GOING WRONG FOR YOU, AND THEY ALWAYS TURN OUT OKAY. BUT THE ODDS SAY EVENTUALLY I'M GONNA PULL A BAD HAND. AND SOMEBODY'S GONNA CALL ME, AND I'M GONNA GET SMOKED ! CHARLIE, YOUR FEAR IS A MAGNET. ALL THIS STUFF THAT YOU'RE RUNNING FROM IS JUST GONNA SHOW UP EVEN BIGGER. FINE. LET IT SHOW UP LATER. [ Police Siren, Distant ] PHEW. DODGED ANOTHER BULLET, HUH ? LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO. YOU KNOW SOMETHING ? H'M ? YOU-- LET'S GET SOMETHING TO EAT. I'M STARVED. [ Patrons Chattering ] [ Jason ] OKAY. IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, THE CLIMATE-- - IS THAT CHARLIE ? - THIS IS AMAZING !

LET ME GET YOU SOME. ARMAND, TWO MORE PLATES OF THE RAVIOLI. - OH, AND A BOWL OF STRAWBERRIES FOR MY FRIEND, PLEASE. - [ Inaudible ] [ Jason ] SO, WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE SETTING ? WE REALLY LOVED THE MOORISH VILLA. AH, VERY ROMANTIC. A FULL MOON OVER MARAKESH, A HOOKAH FULL OF HASHISH AND THE DANCE OF THE SEVEN VEILS. [ Woman ] SOMETHING LIKE THAT. [ Jason ] YEAH. I'M INTO CONTEMPORARY, YOU KNOW ? PEOPLE GET TOO SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THE CLASSICS. THERE'S NO REASON TO BELIEVE... THAT THINGS AREN'T JUST AS GOOD TODAY AS 200 YEARS AGO. WE'RE JUST MADE TO THINK THAT EVERYTHING NEW IS SHIT. - EVERYTHING NEW IS SHIT. - FULVIO HATES ANYTHING THAT'S NOT 2,000 YEARS OLD. WELL, THEN, YOU MUST'VE REALLY LOVED THE SICILIAN FARMHOUSE, HUH ? [ Fulvio ] IT WAS A MASTERPIECE. [ Judy ] YEAH. THERE'S A PHOTO EXHIBIT OF THE AGRIGENTO RUINS AT THE MET YOU SHOULD GO SEE. - THOSE ARE MY FAVORITE RUINS. CHARLIE ? - MM-H'M ? - THAT GIRL'S A GEM. - I HAVE TO SAY THAT I'M PARTIAL TO ROCOCO. [ Jason ] WELL, LET'S FACE IT. IT'S ALL GREAT. I MEAN, IT WAS THE BEST OF EVERYTHING, THE DISNEY WORLD OF GLOBAL HOME DESIGN. - I-I-I-- - [ All Gasping ] - [ Cries Out ] - JESUS. [ Whistling ] HEY, HEY ! HEY, HEY, HEY ! LET HIM GO ! LET HIM GO ! HELP ! SOMEBODY HELP ! GET OFF HIM ! GET-- IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. HONEY. HELP ! SOMEBODY HELP ! DON'T START WITH ME. STOP IT ! ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND ? LISTEN. LISTEN. I'M A FRIEND OF ELLIOTT'S. HE'LL EXPLAIN LATER. NOW, DON'T WORRY. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE CHECK. SIR, YOU'D BETTER LEAVE RIGHT NOW, OR I'LL HAVE TO CALL THE POLICE. I'M SORRY FOR THE DISTURBANCE. HE'S ACTUALLY A FRIEND OF MINE. I'LL PAY FOR HIS BILL AND ANY OTHER PROBLEMS. OKAY ? THANKS. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT ? HE WAS MOUTHING OBSCENITIES AT MY DATE RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIS WIFE. I HAD TO DEAL WITH IT. SCUMBAG SON OF A BITCH. HEY, LISTEN. LET'S HAVE A DRINK AT THE BAR, TALK A LITTLE BUSINESS, HUH ? THE GIRLS'LL BE FINE. COME ON. YEAH. YEAH. YOU ALL RIGHT ? SMOKE ? NO. FIDEL, JASON AND FULVIO WANNA TALK ABOUT ANOTHER MOVE. I DON'T KNOW. LAST ONE WAS PRETTY SCREWY. THEY CLEANED OUR TWO MILL, JUST LIKE THEY SAID THEY COULD. AND WE SWALLOWED OUR TAKE. WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND ? [ Jason ] I'M PROPOSING THAT WE BUY THE MARKET. IF WE CAN CONTROL OVER A THIRD OF A COMMODITY, WE CAN PRICE FIX. WHAT'S IT GONNA COST TO BUY THE MARKET ? WE'D NEED TO PUT OUT ABOUT 40 MILLION. YOU WANT ME TO PUT UP $40 MILLION ? - I WONDER WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS THEY'RE TALKIN' ABOUT. - [ Clears Throat ] - THEY'RE LAUNDERIN' MONEY. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? CUTE COLOMBIAN AND HIS BOYFRIEND WITH THE BLACK EYE, THEY REPRESENT A BIG DRUG CARTEL. THEY'RE LOOKIN' TO INVEST BILLIONS IN WALL STREET, AND YOUR BOYFRIEND'S SETTIN' IT UP. - WOW. HOW EXCITING. - YEAH, WELL, FULVIO WILL FUCK THE WHOLE THING UP. TRUST ME. - WHY DO YOU SAY THAT ? - HE'S OUT OF HIS LEAGUE. HE DOESN'T HAVE THE BRAINS OR THE SELF-CONTROL TO PULL ANYTHING LIKE THIS OFF. HE'S PRETENDIN'. HAVE A LITTLE FAITH IN HIM. FAITH IN FULVIO ? HE'S A LOSER. HIS BIG AMBITION'S TO BE A GARDENER LIKE HIS GRANDFATHER, BUT THE FUCKIN' MORON CAN'T EVEN GROW A TOMATO. YOU EVER HEAR OF AN ITALIAN WHO CAN'T GROW A TOMATO ? [ Chuckles ] - I REST MY CASE. WHICH WAY IS THE JOHN ? - OH. - MUST BE GOING THROUGH A DOWN PHASE. - SEEMS THAT WAY. - I'LL PUT IN 20 MILLION IF YOU MATCH IT. - NO FUCKIN' WAY. FIDEL, THEY ARE SUPPLYING THE SET-UP. THEY DON'T NEED THEIR MONEY LAUNDERED. EVERYBODY NEEDS THEIR MONEY CLEANED, RIGHT ? BESIDES, THIS IS SUCH A GREAT DEAL-- IT'S GONNA PROVIDE SO MUCH PROFIT-- I SAY COUNT ME IN FOR HALF. I THINK THAT'S VERY REASONABLE. CHARLIE, WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE ? FUCKIN' SANTA CLAUS ? WHERE AM I GONNA GET $20 MILLION ? - DO I LOOK LIKE FUCKIN' SANTA CLAUS ? - LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT IT. GO AHEAD. TALK ABOUT IT. GET BACK TO ME. COME ON. [ Water Splashing ] YOU STILL THINK THE GODS LOVE ME ? [ Judy ] WELL, YOU'RE STILL ALIVE. [ Duck Squeaking ] YEAH, THAT WAS BECAUSE I PUNCHED OUT POOR ELLIOTT. OH, GOD. HERE. WHAT IS THIS ? DON'T ASK. MM-- [ Gags ] I GUESS THIS IS GOOD FOR ME, RIGHT ? MM-H'M. OH. OHH. SO WHAT'D YOU THINK OF THE DEATH SQUAD ? I DON'T KNOW. THEY SEEMED FAIRLY NORMAL. "FAIRLY NORMAL" ? YOU THOUGHT FULVIO WAS FAIRLY NORMAL ? HE SHOT ESTUVIO'S BALL OFF. [ Back Cracks ] OOH. HE JUST SEEMS-- HE JUST SEEMS VERY UNHAPPY. I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT. DID YOU GET A LOAD OF HIS WIFE ? MM-H'M. SHE SEEMS PRETTY UNHAPPY TOO. YEAH ? SHE DIDN'T HAPPEN TO MENTION FULVIO'S ACHILLES HEEL ? TOMATOES. TOMATOES ? MM-H'M. WHAT IS THIS ABOUT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES ? [ Back Cracks ] [ Rings ] I'LL GET IT. HELLO ? THIS ONE. HELLO ? WHAT THE HELL DO YOU NEED ME FOR ? I NEED YOU TO EXPLAIN THE DEAL. YOU'RE BETTER AT THOSE THINGS THAN ME. I AM NOT GONNA EXPLAIN IT TO YOUR DON. OH, YES, YOU ARE. NO, I'M NOT. [ Cocks Gun ] HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW ME. WHY THE HELL WOULD HE PUT UP 20 MILL... ON THE WORD OF A TOTAL STRANGER ? PEOPLE LIKE YOU. FULVIO TELLS ME YOU'RE A VERY SMART FELLER. I DON'T KNOW HOW SMART IT IS... TO ASK CARMINE MINNETTI TO PUT UP 20 MILL FOR YOU TO PLAY WITH. BUT YOU TELL ME. - IT'S NOT VERY SMART, SIR. - HE'S JUST KIDDIN'. RIGHT, CHARLIE ? - SHUT UP, FULVIO. KEEP TALKIN', CHARLIE. - NOTHIN' TO SAY. ANYTIME YOU PUT UP THAT KIND OF MONEY, YOU'RE TAKIN' A BIG CHANCE. WELL, IF BUYING UP A THIRD OF THE MARKET... MEANS IT'S THAT EASY TO PRICE FIX, WOULDN'T MORE GUYS BE DOIN' IT ? - BUT, YOU KNOW, WALL STREET TRADERS DO IT EVERY DAY-- - I SAID SHUT UP, FULVIO. - TELL ME WHAT COULD GO WRONG. - FIRST OF ALL, WE'VE GOTTA PUT THE 40 MILL TOGETHER... AND MAKE SURE NO LITTLE THINGS FUCK UP. YOU KNOW, A ROUTINE TRAFFIC STOP GOES BAD. SOMEBODY GETS GREEDY AND DECIDES TO RUN WITH THE CASH. THEN WE HAVE TO MANIPULATE THE MARKET... WITHOUT THE S.E.C. CATCHING WIND OF WHAT WE'RE DOING, WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE, BECAUSE ONCE YOU BUY UP A THIRD OF THE MARKET, THEY'RE GONNA KNOW. AND THEY'RE GONNA BE SNIFFIN' UP OUR RECTUMS FOR UNPLEASANT AROMAS. I LIKE YOU, CHARLIE. AT LEAST YOU DON'T TRY TO BULLSHIT ME. I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT THIS. I'LL CALL YOU LATER. JUST KEEP THE PHONE ON. THAT'S THE WAY YOU HELP ME ? I TAKE YOU TO MEET THE CHIEF, AND YOU QUEER THE DEAL ! WE DON'T KNOW THAT THE DEAL IS QUEERED. WAIT FOR THE CALL. YOU TOLD HIM NOT TO DO IT ! YOU TOLD HIM A THOUSAND THINGS COULD GO WRONG. I WANTED TO ESTABLISH SOME TRUST. TRUST ? YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO SWEET TALK 'IM, USE A LITTLE SALESMANSHIP ! YOU PRACTICALLY TOLD HIM RUN FOR THE HILLS AND HOLD ONTO HIS BALLS ! I WAS USING REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY. WE DON'T WANNA APPEAR TOO EAGER. TOO EAGER ! I AM FUCKIN' EAGER ! I WANT OUT OF THIS SHIT ! I'M SICK OF BEIN' A FUCKIN' CLICHE. I NEED SOME CASH...

I THOUGHT YOU LOVED YOUR WORK. YOU DON'T KNOW ME. NOBODY KNOWS ME. YEAH. I'M SORRY, MAN. UM, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL. HOW COULD YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ? EVERYTHING GOES RIGHT FOR YOU. DEXTER, I DON'T KNOW. I WASN'T COUNTIN' ON PLAYIN' WITH MY OWN MONEY. TWENTY MILLION WOULD LEAVE ME SERIOUSLY EXPOSED. ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS SHOW 'EM THE 20 MILL. THEY SHOW US THEIRS. I POP 'EM ALL. WE LEAVE A COUPLE MILLION AT THE CRIME SCENE, POCKET THE REST. ONE DAY'S WORK: $18 MILLION. JUST MAKE SURE MY SON-IN-LAW ACCIDENTALLY GETS KILLED IN THE PROCESS. DONE. WHY ARE YOU GOING TO DO ANOTHER DEAL WITH THEM, HUH ? AFTER ALL THAT THEY'VE DONE, YOU ARE GOING TO GIVE THEM $20 MILLION, HUH ? I'M NOT GONNA GIVE THEM $20 MILLION. I'M GOING TO SHOW THEM $20 MILLION. THEN I'M GOING TO KILL THAT FULVIO NESSTRA, AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE HIS MONEY. WHAT ABOUT CHARLIE ? WE'LL KILL HIM TOO. YOU FORGOT WHO BROUGHT HIM TO THIS DANCE. - DON'T LOOK AT IT. - THEY'LL PAY FOR HURTING YOU, MI VIDA. [ Fulvio ] MY LIFE IS SHIT, CHARLIE. MAYBE THAT'S WHY I'M ALWAYS READY TO FUCK SOMEBODY UP. YOU KNOW, MOST OF THE TIME I'M JUST WALKIN' AROUND... WAITIN' FOR SOMEBODY TO SAY SOMETHING WRONG JUST SO I CAN DO 'EM. - [ Charlie ] WHY ? - I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE I GOT LOW SELF-ESTEEM OR SOMETHIN'. EVERYBODY I EVER KNEW JUST TREATED ME LIKE I WAS DOG SHIT, EVEN MY FUCKIN' GRANDMOTHER. COULD YOU BELIEVE AN ITALIAN GRANDMA WOULD TREAT HER SWEET LITTLE BAMBINO LIKE A HERPE ? LISTEN, FULVIO. EVERYBODY FEELS THAT. EVERYBODY HAS SELF-DOUBT. NOT YOU, MAN. YOU DON'T EVEN FLINCH. YOU'RE SO FUCKIN' COOL, I STICK A GUN IN YOUR FACE, YOU TAKE A FUCKIN' NAP. SO DON'T TRY AND TELL ME YOU GOT YOUR DOUBTS. I KNOW YOU'RE JUST TRYIN' TO SAY THAT... TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER. IF ONLY SOMETHING WOULD CHANGE. I KNOW LIFE COULD BE SWEET. I COULD BE TOO. I WANNA BE SWEET. [ Phone Rings ] [ Phone Beeps On ] YES, DON CARMINE ? EH ? YEAH. [ Phone Beeps Off ] HE'S GONNA DO IT. - HOW'D YOU KNOW ? - I JUST TRY TO GO WITH THE FLOW. THEY ARE BRINGING $40 MILLION CASH. IF NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO MAKE THE BUST, WHEN IS ? THE VAILLARS HAVE BILLIONS. YOU POP 'EM FOR $40 MILLION; IT'D BE LIKE ME STEALIN' A QUARTER OUT OF YOUR POCKET. WE CAN ALSO PUT FIDEL VAILLAR AWAY. HE'S A MAJOR PLAYER. PEDRO VAILLAR HAS TWELVE SONS. HE DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT LOSING FIDEL. HE DOESN'T EVEN LIKE THE LITTLE FAG. FIDEL'S GAY ? - OH-- - NO. I NEVER KNEW. LISTEN, CHARLIE. YOU'RE DOIN' A GREAT JOB ON THIS. WE GOT ALL THE DEALS DOCUMENTED. WE KNOW JUST WHERE ALL THE CERTIFICATES ARE. WE DRAIN THE VAILLAR RESOURCES, AND THEN WE SHUT 'EM DOWN. NOBODY'S EVER DONE THAT TO A CARTEL. LONNY. [ Door Closes ] [ Dr Bleckner ] HE JUST NAILED YOU ? NO ATTEMPT AT COMMUNICATION ? [ Elliott ] IT WAS A BLOODBATH. I NEVER THOUGHT ANYTHING LIKE THAT COULD HAPPEN IN MY LIFE. ELLIOTT, I AM SO SORRY, MAN. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO GET ME KILLED. OH, GEEZ, WHAT DID I DO ? CHARLIE, ELLIOTT'S NOT TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE RESTAURANT. WHAT'S GOIN' ON ? I FINALLY LOST IT AT WORK THIS MORNING. WHAT HAPPENED ? WELL, THERE WAS A MEETING OF DEPARTMENT HEADS, AND I IMPLIED THAT THE HEAD OF MARKETING WAS RIGID. - SO ? - AND I CALLED HER JOB SKILLS INTO QUESTION. - AND ? - THEN I JUMPED ON THE TABLE... AND SCREAMED THAT SHE WAS A PSYCHO NIGGER CUNT... UNFIT FOR WORK ANYWHERE EXCEPT A LOW-LEVEL BUREAUCRACY SOMEWHERE. - THEN THEY FIRED ME. - OH, JESUS, ELLIOTT. I DON'T CARE SO MUCH ABOUT LOSING MY JOB OR MY WIFE LEAVING ME. - YOUR WIFE LEFT YOU ? - LAST NIGHT. THE THING THAT'S KILLING ME IS THAT THERE'S THIS ASSISTANT WHO TAKES THE NOTES... AT ALL THE MEETINGS, AND SHE'S JUST WONDERFUL. SHE JUST HAS THE FACE OF AN ANGEL, SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PERSONALITY. AND WHEN SHE HEARD ME USE THAT WORD-- SHE'S AFRICAN-AMERICAN-- I SAW HER FACE JUST SINK. BOY, I DID NOT LIKE HURTING HER. I REDUCED EVERYTHING TO THAT UGLINESS BECAUSE I COULDN'T CONTROL MY HATRED... FOR THE HEAD OF MARKETING. [ Sighs ] JESUS. WHAT A PIECE OF SHIT I AM. - HEY, HEY. ELLIOTT, YOU'RE NOT A PIECE OF SHIT. - YES, I AM. - COME ON. SH. - LET'S GIVE ELLIOTT A MOMENT TO COMPOSE HIMSELF. CHARLIE, DIDN'T YOU MENTION YOU HAD A SHOWDOWN COMING UP ? ISN'T THAT ON YOUR MIND ? YEAH. IT'S TOMORROW. TOMORROW ? - YEAH. - WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ? - TRY NOT TO GET KILLED. - THAT'S IT ? - YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING ? LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. IF YOU GO INTO A BUSINESS MEETING... AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE ANNIHILATED, WHAT DO YOU DO ? I SHUT MY MOUTH AND TRY TO WEATHER IT. - [ Man ] THERE'S GOTTA BE SOMETHING. - I ALWAYS LOOK FOR AN EDGE. IT'S A LOSE-LOSE SCENARIO. I'M SORRY THAT I HAVE TO DO THIS, BUT I CAN'T STAY LATE TONIGHT. I HAVE ANOTHER ENGAGEMENT I JUST CAN'T BREAK. - THAT'S PERFECTLY UNDERSTANDABLE, DOCTOR. - DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. LISTEN, GUYS, AS THIS IS MY LAST NIGHT AMONG THE LIVING, DO YOU WANNA HAVE A DRINK ? THAT'D BE GREAT. I WOULD LOVE TO-- LOVE TO HAVE A DRINK. [ Charlie ] GOOD NIGHT, DOCTOR. GOOD NIGHT.

I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE A TOAST, GENTLEMEN. - TO THE MEN THAT WE USED TO BE. - YEAH. NO SHIT. - I'M BASICALLY THE SAME GUY. - [ Howard ] WELL, 15 YEARS AGO, I WOULD GO DOWN... TO THE TRADING FLOOR DRESSED LIKE DON JOHNSON. I WAS READY TO KILL. I WAS THE MAN. I WAS THE KING. I WAS FEARLESS. YOU WERE ON COKE. I WAS A LITTLE HIGH, BUT, YOU KNOW, I WAS 25. I THOUGHT I WAS JAMES BOND... -IN MONTE CARLO PLAYING BACCARAT WITH-- WHAT'S THAT GUY WITH-- -ERNST BLOFELD. - ERNST BLOFELD WITH THE CAT ? - WE ALL LOST OUR EDGE. I NEVER PLAYED BACCARAT IN MONTE CARLO, BUT I ONCE DID VEGAS... WITH SOME HONG KONG TRIAD TYPES. PHEW-HOO-HOO. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. I TELL YOU. DRUG LORDS REALLY KNEW HOW TO PARTY. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "KNEW" ? DON'T THEY STILL KNOW HOW TO PARTY ? NOT THE ONES I'M INVOLVED WITH. THEY'RE AS MISERABLE AS WE ARE. WAIT A MINUTE. EVEN THE BAD GUYS ARE UNHAPPY ? [ Exhales ] THAT'S DEPRESSING. LUCIEN, HAVE YOU SEEN LONNY ? HE WAS MESSIN' AT THE COMPUTER, THEN HE BOLTED OUT OF HERE ABOUT TWO MINUTES AGO. YOU'RE IN CONSTANT DANGER. THE PAY ISN'T GREAT. YOU HAVE NO PERSONAL LIFE. -WHY DO YOU DO THIS JOB ? -GOTTA BE SOMETHING ABOUT THE WORK THAT TURNS YOU ON. WHY WOULD YOU DO IT FOR 18 YEARS IF IT WAS AWFUL ? IT WASN'T ALWAYS AWFUL. THERE WAS A TIME THAT IT REALLY WAS INCREDIBLE. - LIKE DRUGS ? - WELL, IT WAS A LOT LIKE GETTING HIGH. I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT THE CAMARADERIE OF DOING IT WITH YOUR BUDDIES, BUT THE GREATEST THING WAS PLAYIN' FOR THE HIGH STAKES. YOU BLOW IT, YOU'RE DEAD. [ Beeps ] [ Lonny On Phone ] HEY, IT'S ME. LISTEN. WE'RE IN SOME SHIT. I GOTTA TALK TO YOU. MEET ME AT 63rd AND 5th. [ Receiver Clicks ] [ Howard ] I LOVE THIS SHIT, SEE. I-I SHOULD'VE BEEN BORN YOU. WHEN I GROW UP, I WANNA BE LIKE CHARLES. - GIVE ME THE GAME. DESCRIBE THE GAME. - WELL, IT'S LIKE I SAID. FIRST, IT'S ABOUT THE STAKES, BUT YOU ARE THE MAN. IT'S JUST YOU AND THE BAD GUY. ANYTIME YOU MAKE CONTACT, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT INFORMATION HE HAS THAT YOU DON'T. HEY, LONNY, CHARLIE LEFT ME A MESSAGE TO COME PICK YOU UP. - HE SAID HE COULDN'T MAKE IT. - [ Elliott ] HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOIN' ON ? - YOU KNOW, WHAT TO DO ? - COME ON. HOP IN. [ Charlie ] YOU GO ON INSTINCT. IT'S A WEIRD KIND OF MAGIC. I DON'T KNOW. A SIXTH SENSE. IF YOU'RE WRONG, YOU'RE DEAD. [ Man ] WHEN THAT GUY CHEEMO KILLED YOUR PARTNER, WHAT HAPPENED ? I NEVER KNEW HOW CHEEMO FIGURED ME OUT IN MIAMI. - I RACKED MY BRAIN OVER IT. - I COULDN'T LIVE LIKE THAT. WELL, UNTIL YOU EXPERIENCE IT, THERE'S NO WAY TO UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE NEVER GONNA LIVE THAT WAY, SO DON'T WORRY. GET BACK TO THE GAME. CAN I HAVE ONE ? OKAY. SO YOU'RE WITH A BAD GUY, AND EVERYTHING'S CASUAL. YOU MAKE INNOCENT SMALL TALK. "WHAT ABOUT THEM MARLINS ?" "DID YOU SEE THE TITS ON THAT BROAD AT THE BAR ?" - SO HOW'S CHARLIE DOIN' ? IS HE GONNA MAKE IT ? - HE'LL BE FINE. [ Charlie ] BUT NONE OF IT'S INNOCENT, 'CAUSE YOU'RE DEALING WITH CUTTING-EDGE CRIMINALS, AND THEY'VE GOT GREAT INSTINCTS TOO, SO IT'S NOT EVEN A QUESTION OF BEING CAUGHT IN A LIE. SIMPLE SMALL TALK BECOMES A GIVEAWAY. BOY, WHAT A CHARACTER. I CAN'T FIGURE THE GUY OUT. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE. [ Charlie ] THE HARDEST PART IS WHEN YOU HAVE TO ASK QUESTIONS. NOTHING'LL GET YOU KILLED FASTER THAN ASKING QUESTIONS. - SO, DID CHARLIE TELL YOU WHERE HE WAS PHONING FROM ? - NO. HE DIDN'T SAY. - DID YOU TALK TO HIM ? - YEAH, YEAH. HE SAID HE WANTED TO MEET BOTH OF US RIGHT AWAY. [ Charlie ] IF THEY'RE BEING FRIENDLY, YOU'VE GOTTA TALK, BE PERSONABLE. BUT IF YOU'RE TOO PERSONABLE, YOU VOLUNTEER A DETAIL ABOUT YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S CELLULITE... OR YOUR NEIGHBOR'S ALUMINUM SIDING-- [ Lonny ] YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN IN TOWN FOR FOUR WEEKS; I HAVEN'T CAUGHT ONE BALL GAME. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY TICKET CONNECTIONS BY ANY CHANCE, DO YOU ? - [ Gunshot ] - [ Grunts ] MAN-- [ Exhales ] IT'S LIKE A LIFE OF PERMANENT JOB INTERVIEWS. I MEAN, YOU'RE ON YOUR BEST, PHONIEST BEHAVIOR. EVERYTHING'S GOING GREAT. YOU TILT YOUR HEAD THE WRONG WAY, AND-- POOF-- YOU DON'T EXIST. [ Inaudible ] [ Telephone Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Phone Beeps On ] HELLO ? HEY, HOWARD. IT'S CHARLIE. I NEED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. CHARLIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN', MAN ? WHAT'S UP ? DO YOU THINK YOU LOSE FAITH FIRST, AND THEN YOUR BALLS GO ? I DON'T KNOW. YOU GOTTA DO SOMETHING DRASTIC TO GET 'EM BACK, RIGHT ? I DON'T HAVE A FASTBALL ANY MORE. THEN YOU GOTTA THROW THE CHANGE-UP. * [ Men Chanting ] I'LL SEE YOU SOON. * [ Ends ] AS SOON AS WE SEE HIS MONEY, PULL YOUR GUN, BUT DON'T SHOOT HIM.
