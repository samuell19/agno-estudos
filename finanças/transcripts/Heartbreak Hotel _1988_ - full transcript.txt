So hush, little baby don't you cry you know your daddy's bound to die. But all my trials, Lord soon be over Jo. - Glory. - Glory, glory. Hallelujah his truth is marching on. His truth is marching on. John, Mom's home. Okay. Okay. Mmm. Waiter! We need some music. Like a fool. Treat me mean and cruel, Cheers. But love me. Wring my faithful heart. - Tear it all apart, - Hey, Mom? - But love me - Mom! You want to turn down the music? We've got school tomorrow. Johnny, Pammie, hi. This is Steve. We met Steve on Tuesday night. - Hi, kids. - You did? - Friday also. - Saturday too. - I'll be sad and blue. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Cryin' over you. - Just turn it down a little, please. - Okay. - Good night, kids. Oh, boy. - Let's go to sleep. - Would beg and steal. - Beg and steal. - Just to feel. What? I don't feel like dancing anymore. - Well, let's go upstairs. - No, no. Well, what? It's not right. I think you should go home. - You really want me to go? - I want you to go. It's not right. - Fine! - Oh, so lonely 'cause I feel my soul on fire Pushin' me on takin' me higher I see my soul on fire. Who can resist a feeling like this. Soul on fire. Soul on fire. Whoa! Man, we're ready for today, aren't we? You gotta be kiddin'. You know they're gonna cut us again. Are you whacked? We play better than ever. We kick. They're gonna pull some kind of bullshit excuse right out of left field. - What was it last year? - Dress code. We didn't fit in. All right, So we cover our asses. We make it so these guys can't come up with any excuses. Yeah. Your brother still work at Taylor Tux? Yeah. Why? Oh, no, John. No way. Monkey suits. No way. - No way. He's right. - Come on, you guys. This talent show is the only place we could play, man. Three years in a row we've been cut. You know how many people are gonna be there? John! Breakfast! I gotta go. See ya later. - Thirty-eight regular, man. - Thirty-eight regular. Where are the Sugar Smacks? You're not getting enough nutrition lately. Eating that sugarcoated crap clogs your blood. We out of Sugar Smacks? - What is it with you two? - You feeling guilty about something? - What did you say? - You heard me. Why is it every time I try to do something nice... you've got to twist it into something selfish and mean? I call 'em like I see 'em. - I don't like the way you see 'em. - Me neither, ma. I'm sick of you commenting on my private life. It is my business. As soon as your private life starts interfering with my life and Pammie's life... then it becomes my business too. Day after day I'm more confused. Yet I look for the light through the pouring rain. You know that's a game that I hate to lose, And I'm feelin' the strain. Ain't it a shame. Oh, give me the beat, boys and free my soul. And drift away... - She's good, isn't she? - Oh, yes. This is so cool, man. She's playing Bob Dylan, and those bozos don't even know it. We got a better chance of winning the Vietnam War than making it with a girl like that. Shut up. Excellent, Beth. - Was that Debussy? - No. An obscure American composer. Oh, yes. Well, congratulations. We'll see you at rehearsal Saturday afternoon. Okay, thank you. Johnny Wolfe... and the Wolfepack. Hi. This is a song I wrote. It's called “Soul On Fire.” Soul on fire Soul on fire now. Huh! There's somethin' that's hurtin' me I'm talkin' about that bloody war. Where children are dyin' in a country. That can't take much more. It's a fight for survival. And if I fight all alone I'm gonna beat every rival. Stop it! Stop I Say! Won't let go 'cause I feel My soul on fire... Thank you very much, Mr. Wolfe. That's it, man? You're not gonna let us finish? I'm sorry, but we find the lyrics objectionable. Object... Ah, come on. Last year you said it was the dress code. A year before that, you said their hair was too long. The year before that, you said we had to take a semester of that glee club to qualify. What you're really saying is that you don't like rock 'n' roll. That's not true. Last year, Mitch Engle sang a rock song. He sang “Close To You” by the Carpenters. That's not rock 'n' roll. - Mr. Wolfe! - I'm sorry. We worked really hard for this. We rented these tuxes and all. If you would just give us a chance. - I'm sorry. - John, that's all right, man. Please, sir, just a chance. Please get off the stage. We have to continue with the auditions. It's all right, man. It's all right. Don't worry about it. - Why? - Thank you. The Bonnie Rowan Trio. Don't you hate cleaning this place up every night? I mean, no one ever comes here anyway. Mom figures we might get a guest someday. I guess this place reminds her of dad. I heard he's got a new family and everything. Pammie, that's not true. Dad's not the kind of guy who wants a family. If he was, he'd be back here with us. Right? Right? - Hi. - Ma, the floor's wet. Okay. You can put that away. - Let's go. - Where're we going? We're going to an Elvis double feature at the drive-in. Pammie's got to study. - She can study in the back seat. - Why do we have to see an Elvis movie? Why can't we see something cool? Let's go see The Godfather. A boy your age can learn a lot from the King. He isn't the King anymore. He lost that a long time ago. - He is still the King. - How many times I gotta tell ya? His hair is full of oil and grease. He's got big ol' hairy lamb chops on his face. All his songs are about Hawaii. He makes lousy movies. And he sucks at guitar, Mom. Pete Townshend would waste him. Tell me. What is a guy like me gonna learn from a guy like that? There was a time when every guy wanted to be Elvis. If you want to learn something from Elvis... watch the way he treats women. You'll have every girl at school wanting a date with you. Come on. Come on, Pammie. Come on. It'll be fun. Hey, you, sideburns. I got a chick down there wants to hear you sing. - I'm sorry, sir, I... - It's pure. Pure. What? Elvis. He's so pure, so clean, like... Like Ivory Soap suds covered with sweet cream. That's about the corniest thing I've ever heard you say. - Well, heist. - Pure. You know, your dad was a little like Elvis. - No. Was he? - Mm-hmm. You know, once, for our eighth wedding anniversary... your dad got this new rowboat, the Irish Mist. We took it out for a moonlight sail to the gazebo. And we had beer and pizza... and we made love right there in the gazebo. Ah, come on. Well, we did occasionally make love. It's normal. Where in the hell do you think you came from? I know. But now every time I take a boat ride, I'm gonna think of you two goin' at it. Oooh. Anyway, after we make love... - he gets his guitar... - Dad played guitar? No. No, but he taught himself three chords... just so he could sing me my favorite Elvis song, “Love Me.” And he starts singing, and his voice is real flat... and gravelly, like when I hear you singing sometimes. - Thanks. - No! But it was, it was real... It was real meaningful. It was real... It was so beautiful. You know, I almost started to cry. I had... I leaned over to give him a hug... and knocked the guitar into the water. It floated away. We never got it back. Guess it kinda ruined the anniversary, huh? I always thought... you know, if I'd just saved that guitar... I might've saved our marriage. I could never be like Elvis. - Why not, honey? - I can't grow good sideburns. - What do you do for a living? - Work in auto accessories. Why? I usually get paid for singin', and I figure you oughta do whatever you do for me. So how about putting a new set of seat covers on my car? Why, sure, sideburns. What color you want? I figure his color's yellow, don't you? You believe this? This is so fake. - Watch it. - I can't watch it. Johnny, what's your guitar doing here? There was an audition today. We got cut. Oh. Do you want to talk about it? Yeah. Let me just put Pammie to bed. Okay. - Pammie, I'm gonna turn out this light. - No. - Just for tonight. - No, come on. You know what dark does. Pam. Dark's when they come out. The slimy soul suckers. - That's a fairy tale. - Is not! Lucy Cheswick's cousin got taken by a slimy soul sucker. Lucy Cheswick's cousin died of pneumonia. Did not. Their electricity went out... and a slimy soul sucker oozed out of the darkness... put its five-foot sharp fingernails into Lucy's cousin's mouth... reached way down inside and scooped out her soul. And you believe that? Well, she's dead, isn't she? You know, I sleep with my lights off. How come they don't get me? Slimy soul suckers only Kill little girls. That's right, I forgot. How stupid of me. - Good night, honey. - Good night, John. - What's that? - I don't know. Close your eyes, go to sleep. Both of you. Marie! Hey, baby I'll be back in 20 minutes. - We can talk then, okay? - Sure. Whatever. - Twenty minutes. - Right. He's a big boy. He'll take care of himself. You left your front door open. There's guys out there been out of work a year, just lookin' for an open front door. They come in, open up your throat, and steal your Zenith... in 20 seconds. You came in here to tell me that my front door is open? No. It's your mom. Don't worry, she's gonna be okay. She's in the hospital. Is that how Elvis looks now, Aunt Irene? - Mm-hmm. - Don't like that white suit he's wearing. Neither do. He dresses like he works at the Diary Queen or something. Look. It says Elvis is coming to Cleveland on Saturday. - John, can we go see him? - Don't think so. - Mom would love it. - I know she'd love it. But I thinks she's still gonna be here. Don't worry about a thing. I'll take care of the kids, and you take care of yourself. Okay. Thanks. Pammie, go say hi to your mommy. - What happened? - Steve was drinking. And he got into an accident. - Is she gonna be all right? - Yeah, she'll be all right. She has a slight concussion and a couple bruised ribs. What happened to her eye? Hmm, I guess she and Steve had a fight. He hit her? - Is he here in the hospital? - No, they released him. Son of a bitch! Johnny, come on, relax. Okay? Don't upset your mom. She's gonna be all right. I'm sorry. You're right. - I'm gonna go talk to her. - Yeah. I'll be home soon. Hey, scram. - Hey, Mom. - Hi, Johnny. Long 20 minutes, huh? Yeah. Hey, ma? You think we'll ever be okay again? I mean, like normal. Yeah. Sure. Every day when I wake up... I hope things'll get better. They never do. Maybe if you could just tell me, Mom. What can I do to help you? What can I do that's gonna make you happy again? I don't know. Listen, you stay right here. Okay? Don't move. Hi, John. How ya doin'? You stay away from my mother. What are you looking at? What were you watching? Treat me like a fool. Treat me mean and cruel. But love me. Wring my faithful heart. Tear it all apart - But love me. - Won't you love me. Guys, I need your help. Yeah? What's up, man? We're gonna give my mom a date with Elvis Presley. What are you gonna do? Kidnap him? - Whatever it takes. - Come on, man. We gonna fly to Memphis or Hollywood or wherever the hell he lives? No, he's playing in Cleveland next Saturday. The guy's got like 900 bodyguards. - We're gonna go in with guns, right? - Machine guns. No machine guns, no violence. It's gonna be real safe. If we're gonna get arrested for kidnapping somebody... - we should get arrested for kidnapping... - Mick Jagger! - Mick Jagger! - We're not gonna get arrested. Besides, I just gotta get close enough to talk to him. Maybe we could convince him to come back with us. He's a regular guy like us. A regular guy like us doesn't have $50 million... his own private jet, and a different girl in bed every night. How many times do I got to tell you guys that I'm serious? You guys know about my mom. She's... She's in a lot of trouble, man. And she loves Elvis Presley more than anything. And I figure, you know, if I can make her happy... then maybe I can hold our family together. Ha! Check this out. Elvis perfume. - Elvis dog tags. Elvis lipstick. - Elvis buttons. Is there anything this guy didn't put his face on? I've got it. I know how we can get close to Elvis. How? - We send him a pizza. - A pizza? Dress up like a pizza delivery guy, walk up and knock on his door. - And there you are. It's beautiful. - Right. Then what do I do when he says... “I didn't order a pizza, son”? That's your chance to talk to him, convince him to come home with ya. It's no good. There's gonna be too many people around. I've gotta get him away from everyone. We have to have him alone. Rosie. - Rosie? - Rosie? - The pizza lady? Check this out, man. Rosie looks a lot like Gladys Presley. - Elvis's mother. - Wow! They don't look anything alike. You're just lookin' at the surface stuff. Check it out! They've got the same eyes, same face. How's she supposed to help us get Elvis? Elvis was crazy about his mother. He loved her more than anything. But it says here she's been dead over ten years. It doesn't matter. Elvis is like an intense kind of guy. He believes in all that astrological and Middle Eastern supernatural bullshit. I get it. We're gonna mess with his head. - Congratulations, Rosie. - What for? My school had this contest, and you are the winner. You're kidding! What did I win? You won a free ticket, front row... to see Elvis Presley in concert tonight in beautiful downtown Cleveland. - Oh. - What's wrong? Do you think I could exchange it for Tom Jones? I, I'm sorry. Uh... Uh, maybe I'll let my sister Anne go instead. She likes Elvis better than I do. No. You see, you can't... because part of the prize is that you get to meet Elvis Presley in person. Ah! That's neat! I never met a real celebrity be... Oh! But... Hey, what's the catch? - Catch? - Yeah. There's always a catch when you win these things. Tony, did you get the ether from your old man's pharmacy? Just in case. Yeah, I snuck in after the place closed. - Brian, did you get the concert tickets? - Yeah, front row. I had to wait in line all night, man. Stay here. I'll be right back. Gladys Presley has risen from the grave. One night with you. Is what I'm now prayin' for. - Tony, do me a favor, park the car. - Yeah, sure. - Is this it, Johnny? We're here? - This is it. We're here. I get to meet him now, huh? Yeah, real soon. I wish I didn't have to wear this wig. I like my hair blonde. I told you before. Elvis loves women with dark hair. And this dress, it is horrible. - It's blue. Elvis's favorite color. - Really? Yeah. Haven't you ever heard of the song “Blue Suede Shoes”? Yeah. Sorry. Could we get through here? Thanks. - Excuse me. I'm sorry. - Thanks. You Okay? There he is! Satnin'. - I'm goin' out. - What for? I want a cheeseburger. - I'll call room service. - I don't want a room service burger. I want one of them greasy kinds, like you get in a coffee shop... with the little jukeboxes on the tables. The whole city knows you're here. It's on the radio, TV, in the papers. You go out, people'll tear you up. I want a cheeseburger! - We'll send somebody out for one. - I want to go out and get it. I want to sit down in the coffee shop and eat it myself. We can do like we always do. We'll go there after hours. You can have the whole coffee shop to yourself, grease and all. I'm sick of havin' the place all to myself! Come in. Western Union time, “Dear Elvis: Best wishes for a successful Cleveland appearance. Richard M. Nixon.” Good ol' Dick don't forget, does he? No, sir. Can't come to your show tonight... “because my sister got in a car accident and she's in the hospital. I hope you do great. Diana Cantinflas.” - Cruel world out there, isn't it? - You said it, - Some things just don't seem fair. - Truer words “was” never spoken. - Send her a Cadillac. - Right away. I've come back for you, my baby boy.” Have mercy! “Just like I always told you I would. “Love and kisses from your precious... Satnin'." Satnin'? Who's that? Some Vegas stripper? Come on, man. He don't know any better. Come on, He didn't know. I'm sorry. You haven't been around long enough to know. Know what, “E”? Satnin'. That's what he used to call his mama. It was kinda like his pet name for her. Ladies and gentlemen, it's Elvis time. Elvis! Elvis! Elvis! Elvis! Elvis! Elvis! Elvis! Elvis! Elvis! Look here, George. Alice Cooper. Hmph. Maybe I oughta grow my hair long, huh? Stop wearin' these funky white suits and playin' Vegas. Really rock 'em again. Sure, man, if you want to lose your audience. My audience is in danger of dyin'. - I wanna play for the kids again. - You still got young fans. - Where do they sit? In the back row? - Hell, You can't afford to take a chance like that. When I was broke, I could afford to do anything I wanted. Now I'm a millionaire, can't afford to do a damn thing. Elvis! Elvis! Elvis! Elvis! Jo. Show time. Whew. Whew. Oh, my God! Well, that's all right, my mama That's all right with you That's all right, my mama Any way you do my mama, all right That's all right That's all right, my mama. Any way you wanna do.

Falling in love with you. Shall I stay. Would it be a sin. For I can't help. Falling in love. - Rosie, get up. Let's go. - With you, - Give him the flowers. - The flowers? Like a river flows, Surely to the sea. Darling, so it goes. Some things are meant to be. Take my hand, Take my whole life too. Did you see Elvis take the flowers? For I can't help falling in love. - With you, - Yeah! For I can't help falling in love with You Ladies and gentlemen... Elvis has left the building. Thank you. Let's go. UP, UP, UP- Yeah, man, yeah. Sounds just like rock and roll to me. Good show. Oh, my God. What's wrong, man? Nothin'. Nothin' at all's wrong. Then sings my soul. My savior God to thee. How great thou art. How great thou art. - Oh, man, he's never gonna show. - Just relax. Jesus. - There he is! - Are you sure? - That's definitely him. - Get down! Stay down! Shh. - Just drive up. - I'm gonna. Just stay calm, all right? Who are you? I'm happy to meet you, Mr. Presley. - What? - Say “cheese.” Hi, there, Mr. Presley. How are you? My name is Johnny Wolfe. I'm from Taylor, Ohio. What the hell's goin' on? Nothing. Me and my friends were wondering if you'd like to come to my house for a couple days. No one's gonna hurt ya. What's the idea dressin' somebody up like my mother? - You some kinda sicko or what? - No, I'm not. I figured this was the only way I could get close to you. You're sick. Please, just listen to my problem for one second. Get out of my way, son. - Please, just listen to me, sir. - I mean it. Move. - Move! - Brian, now! - Wha... - What are you doing? - All, right, um... - What are you doing? - Carry him in the car. Rosie, get in. - No! God! What are you doing? What have you done? - Oh, no! - No one's gonna get hurt. Please, Rosie. - I'm sorry! You didn't say this. - I know I didn't say this. This is really not part of the package or anything. - Don't hurt him. - Don't worry, Rosie. The police are gonna get us. No police are gonna get involved. Don't worry. A very old friend. Came by today, 'Cause he was telling everyone in town... Of the love that he'd just found, And the reason is. Of his latest flame Yeah, and my reason is of his latest flame, Oh, and my reason is... You kids ain't gettin' away with this. I'm calling Sheriff Abrams. I'm turning you guys in. - John, man. - Uh, Rosie? What? I tell you what. You don't turn us in to the cops... and your sister Anne could be... the only girl in town who gets to meet Elvis Presley. Mama. She'd really like that. Okay. Okay, I'm gonna keep my mouth shut. I'll bring her by the hotel tonight. Okay? - Come on, come on. - It's all right. The weight is off. Come on, come on. - Are we pushing? - No, he's slipping again. - My feet, my feet. - Paul, you gotta push. Look out! His arm! His arm got stuck! Push through. Push through there. - Pull it! - Nice shot! Bring him to my house. Come on. All right, push. He's like a dead mule. I'm tryin'. He's slippin'! Paul, you gotta push. John, John! Come on. Inside. Inside. Johnny! Johnny, wake up. Pammie. - Is that clad? - Nah. It's Elvis Presley. No way. Ah. Mmm. Wow! What're you gonna do with him? I'm gonna give him to mom. Kinda like a “welcome home” gift. Bet she likes him more than the earrings I got her. Pammie! - Time for church. - Coming. Don't say anything to Aunt Irene about this, okay? - Zip. - Zip. Huh? You. Outta my way, kid. - I don't want to have to use this. - Now, look here. You let me out of here now, and I won't press charges. - I'm sorry, I can't. - You want money? I got about 5,000 there. It's yours. Keep it. I don't want your money. I just need you. Me? For what? My mother. Don't you mention mothers. You get me more pissed off. That was a dirty trick you played, messin' with my mind. I'm sorry. It's just... I figured that since you loved your mother so much, you could understand my problem. Don't have time for other people's problems. I just want you to talk to her. - Take her to dinner. - What do I look like? A datin' service? - You're talking to Elvis Presley. - I know exactly who I'm talkin' to. You're the only person who can help her. I got 50 million other fans that say the same thing. Now git! Yeah? Well, you've got a responsibility to those fans. I've got a responsibility to make records. If your mother needs help, tell her to go buy my new album. Now, pull the trigger. Come on, shoot me. Come on. Shoot Elvis Presley. Come on. I'm not gonna shoot ya. I didn't think so. Let me get out of here. So someone comes to you with a problem and you turn your back on them, right? Just like you did with rock 'n' roll. - I never turned my back on rock 'n' roll. - Oh, no? You didn't have to sit through Viva Las Vegas 15 times. I never said my movies had anything to do with rock 'n' roll. How 'bout your concerts? - My concerts kick ass. - Yeah? If you're 65 years old. - Still got young fans. - Where? I don't see any. I'm 17. Nobody my age buys your records. Nobody my age goes to your concerts. Who the hell wants to see some guy prance around on stage... in a white jumpsuit singing “The Battle Hymn of the Republic”? Shoot. We can go see Alice Cooper sing “Eighteen.” - Oh, Alice Cooper! - Yeah. Yeah, a guy with a girl's name... wears women's underwear onstage. I hear he bites the heads off snakes. You'd like that, wouldn't you? I'm not saying he's any better, man. I'm just saying he's cool. Something you used to be. I ain't no used-to-be, boy. You're on your way, man. Why? 'Cause I give the people what they want? Exactly. You're kissin' that same ass you used to kick. Kissin' ass? You used to be the kind of guy who gave the people what they didn't want. The same people you play for today... were scared to death of you in 1956. You were a rebel, man. A bad-ass. You were Elvis. What do you know? A lot more than the Colonel. More than those fat bastards you hang out with. Hell, yeah. When was the last time you even talked to somebody like me, huh? Some little fucking nobody in the middle of Ohio? Hell, man, you've been away from your roots so long... you don't even know what the hell they are. You, uh... You really think I'm losing touch with my roots? I'm saying, one night. One night only. That's just 'cause I don't wanna feel guilty. Yeah, Colonel. Yeah. Listen, I'm sorry I run off like that. No, I... just wanna clear my head. Drive around for a few days. I rented a car. No, I don't need any company. No, there's no phone. You can't get in touch with me. No, I know. Yeah. The concert in Pittsburgh on Sunday. I'll be there. All right, bye. Elvis, what's that “T.C.B.” thing stand for? “Taking care of business.” Now, uh, where can I get some clothes? Uh, come on upstairs. - These are your dad's clothes, huh? - Yep. Me and him must be about the same size. - It's the way I used to dress back in "56." - Yeah, man. My mama says you looked the coolest in '56. - She did, huh? - Yeah, '56. - Hmm. - Except... - I don't know, man. Something's wrong. - What are you talkin' about? I don't know. It just doesn't look right. - Looks fine to me. - Looks fine, but something's just not right. What do you think it is? - Buddy. - Oh, no! - Come on. - Little trim, huh? Maybe wash the black dye out? - You dye your hair? - Well... Who are you to talk about style? What do you call this? Jacket. - That's an American flag! - Yeah, but it looks cool. Sweat on the stripes, and grass stains on the stars. What's next, huh? Flag toilet paper? - Relax, man. It's just a jacket. - It's disgraceful. Take it off. I ain't gonna take it off. It looks too good. Take it off! Here. Hold it. Fold. Again. The youth of this country, goin' straight to the dogs. Man, how come I had to use a lady's razor? I lost mine. Yeah, right. - My mom's home. I'll meet you downstairs. - Yeah, sure, kid. Hi. Hi, ma. Welcome home. Are you trying to save on electricity? It's dark in here! I thought it might be romantic. There's nothing romantic about this place. If you ever go. Darlin', I'll be oh so lonely I'll be sad and blue. Cryin over you. Dear only would beg and steal. Just to feel your warm heart beat close to mine. If you ever go. Darlin', I'll be oh. So lonely. Beggin' on my knees. All I ask is please. Please love me. Holy shit! Ma? What're you do... Johnny? Ma, what are you doing? - It's him. He's here! - I know it's him. - He's in our house! - Would you calm down? - But I'm not ready. I'm not ready at all. - Relax. But, but, but, where did he come from? How did he get here? - I brought him here. - You did not. Look at my hair, it's a wreck. Oh, God, no make-up. A dress. I need a dress. I haven't bought a dress in over two years. - Wait a minute. Johnny, how's this, huh? - Your wedding gown? - Too much, huh? - A little. What am I gonna do? What am I gonna wear, huh? - How did he get here anyway? - I asked him to come here. And he came just like that? - I kinda had to force him. - You forced him? Well, me and the guys, we had to force him to get... Against his will? Yeah. You could get in trouble for doing something like that. - You should not have done it! - I was doing it for you. I don't care who you did it for. It wasn't right. Fine, I'll go down and tell him he can leave... Oh, no. No, wait, wait. Listen, now that he's here, I mean, he could at least stay for dinner. Right. I don't care what you have to do. You go downstairs and keep him here. Right, you got it. Roll the dice. One, two, three, four, five. - Man, I'll bet it's a dream boat. - Dud! Go. - Go. - Here we go. - You're the brunette. - Oh, yeah. Of course I am. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Presley. And, uh... welcome you to our home. Well, you can... You can call me Elvis. Elvis. Of course. Elvis. Oh, my God. - I hope you don't mind cheeseburgers. - Well... - No, ma'am, they're just fine. Thank you. - Oh, good. All these years I've been thinking about this moment... and what it'd be like to finally meet you and have you over for dinner. I had so many questions I wanted to ask you... and I can't think of a single one now. I remember something you wanted to know about Elvis. What? Something I heard you asking Aunt Irene about. What was it, honey? You wondered if Elvis was as good in bed... as he was at singing. My God. Johnny, get the door. Pam! - Johnny, where is he? My sister Anne. - Hi, Rosie. What's going on? I told you I was bringing her by. - I'm sorry. - The Lord have mercy. - Look! There he is. Anne, that's him. - I wanna take a look at this. Rosie! What's up, guys? - How you doing? Look, this is Cheryl. - Hey, hey, hey! And Judy. They're from Meister Burger. - Pleased to meet you. - They'd go out with us if... - If you could introduce us to Elvis. - Come on, guys! - Thanks, man. - You owe us one. Elvis, buddy! Hey, what's up? - Hey, Aunt Irene. - Oh, gosh. This is so big! God, he's beautiful. Irene. Hey, what's happening? This is my uncle's Polka band. I told him about Elvis. I figured they might get discovered. It's more like an Oktoberfest. Holy shit. Go, Rosie, go. Hey! I haven't seen it this lively since your dad was around. Since everybody's here, why don't you bring 'em in the ballroom? I'll get some chips and throw you a real welcome-home party. - That's a great idea. Hurry back. - Okay. Right, do it. Yeah, yeah. Take it home, baby! - Hi, Priscilla. - Hey, Steve. - What? - Buddy. - Hi, John. Come on. I guess he don't feel much like fightin' tonight, does he? - I guess not. - Punk. Good night, John. I wanna break this one, all right? Aren't you gonna turn your lights out and go to sleep? No, she sleeps with them on. Oh! Slimy soul suckers, huh? You know about 'em? Oh, yeah. My little girl Lisa slept with her lights on for I don't know how long to protect herself. So you don't think I'm crazy? Crazy? No. Those things are killers. Little girl like you's gotta watch out for 'em. That's what I've been trying to tell everyone here... but no one will listen. Well, I will. You see, the thing is... people are a little misinformed... about the slimy soul suckers. - Misinformed? - Yeah. They think that slimy soul suckers can only kill... when the lights are out. And, well, that just ain't true. - It isn't? - No. Slimy soul suckers can kill ya when the lights are on too. - They can? - Yeah. What am I gonna do now? Well now, there's a way to beat 'em. But you gotta be tough. Are you tough? Maybe. Uh, what do I have to do? Each night before you go to sleep, you turn out one light. And then the next night, you turn out two lights. And so on until all the lights are out. And that's when the slimy soul suckers will know. Know what? That you're not afraid. You see, they can't stand little girls that aren't afraid. Oh, they'll take off, they'll never come back. Really? Worked for my little girl. Soon as her lights were off.. The slimy soul suckers never came back. - Wow. - Tell you what. Let's start with that one right over there. - What do you say? - Uh, turn it out? Mm-hmm. Couldn't we start with that one? You wanna beat these guys or not? Good girl. There you go. One down. Night, sweetie. Um... Oh! Oh, my God! Johnny! You know, he should've been back a long time ago. - Where'd he go? - I don't know. He said he was going to the party store, but that's a few miles away. Don't you worry. I'll go check on him, all right? Don't worry. Wait right here. Elvis has left the ballroom. Hey, kid, which way to town? Straight down the road. - Can I use your bike? - Yeah, sure, Elvis. Break it, burn it. Drag it all around. Twist it, turn it You can't tear it down 'Cause every minute Every hour. You'll be shaken by the strange and mighty power... Of my love Hey, Elvis. Hey, kid, what happened to you? - I got in a fight. - You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Looks like you lost. No shit. I guess you didn't learn anythin' from watchin' my movies. Huh? In almost all my pictures I get in a fight, and I always win. Well, this one was kind of tough, man. - It was four guys against me. - I had nine of 'em gang up on me once. - Whupped every one of 'em. - This isn't the movies, man. If the situation arose, I'd kick ass with the best of 'em. Right. As long as somebody was yelling “action.” I'm out of here. You need to get on home. Your mama's worried sick. Elvis? Yeah? You know a lot about women, don't ya? Well, son, they're all just girls until I turn 'em into women. Yeah. Well, I figure that's why maybe you can help me. Sure, what's the problem? There's this girl. Her name's Beth. She lives up there, and... I want so badly just to go up to her and ask her on a date. But... don't say anything to anybody. I don't know. I'm... I'm scared. What are you scared of? Well, that she's a g... I don't know. That I'm not good enough for her. Shit. Hell, man, you don't know what the hell this feels like. Oh, yes, I do. Why do you think I spent so much time with my guitar? - Guitar can't say no. - Yeah. But then I discovered the secret. Better than a love potion. I found the key to gettin' any girl you want. What's that? - Confidence. - Confidence? Once I got confidence, I got girls. You got girls "cause you're Elvis Presley." No, son, the ladies came before the hit records. No, honest. Women love confidence. You slick yourself up... shine your shoes, get a nice big bouquet of flowers. And just the confidence it takes to march up that hill and knock on that door... that'll make that little girl fall crazy in love with you. You think so? I know so. Confidence. Yeah. Oh-ho-ho. It's probably the spark plug. It's a brand-new one. Yeah? Well, they give out sometimes, you know. Let me give her a shot, huh? - It takes a gentle touch, you know. - Yeah. You mind? Oh, baby, baby baby, baby, Baby, baby, baby booma, booma, booma.

I haven't been able to do this for 15 years. May I help you? - Yeah, we'll take it. - Oh, of course. Which item? All of it. Everything. - Ah. Delivery date? - Tomorrow morning. Oh, I'm sorry. We require ten days for delivery. - You know who you're talkin' to? - No. I'm Elvis Presley. And I'm Engelbert Humperdinck. Let's go. We'll go to a store where they deliver things when you want 'em.

Um, look, John. You seem like a good kid. And this is nothing personal. But things aren't going too well for you right now. And that's not a healthy atmosphere for Beth. Do you understand? Do you mind giving these to Beth for me? I don't have much use for 'em. Thank you. Oh, hi, Johnny! - Hi, John! - There he is. Well, what do you think? Well, I thought you were just gonna fix things up a bit. I didn't know you were gonna change everything. All this stuff got here today. I got some surprises for you. Come on. - Come on upstairs. - Surprises? You redecorated my whole room? - I can't sleep in here. - Why not? I'll wake up and be Liberace. Johnny. Any kid would kill to have a room like this. What happened to my desk? Where's my bed and my posters? They're all out back. I threw em out. You can turn the rest of this place into Graceland, I don't care. But I'm getting my stuff back. Johnny. - Johnny. - Oh, man. - Johnny, come back. - What's this? I'm talking to you, Johnny. Oh! Look at this poster, man. It's totally ruined. You don't wanna be hangin' up posters of them kind of bands. Why not? Half of 'em are Satan worshipers. That's the kind of music Charlie Manson was listenin' to when he hacked up those people. You ever hear of anybody listen to "All Shook Up” and committin' mass murder? You're crazy. You know that? - God! How could I ever listen to you, huh? - What are you talkin' about? You told me I could go up that hill. You said everything would work out. But I should've known better. Why should anything be different now? I mean, my music doesn't fit in at school. I don't fit in with the girl I like. I don't even fit in in my own home. - Johnny? Johnny? - No, no, let him go. Let him go. Let him blow off a little steam. Come on. Stop. Howdy. Your mama told me you got cut from the talent show. She said it meant a lot to you. I just thought maybe I'd come in here and help you with your song. - Show you some moves. - What's wrong with the way I move? Well, you got no fire in your pants. You're just dead from the waist down. Right. He wants us to stuff our pants and wiggle our asses... to make a bunch of blue-haired ladies scream. Come on. Well, I didn't stuff my pants. God did that. And if you go turnin' your back on those blue-haired ladies... which is part of your audience, you're never gonna get out of this garage. Right. And what're you gonna teach us, huh? How to be you? How to play Vegas? Come on, man. You're almost 40 years old. Everything you knew about rock 'n' roll is gone with the wind. Me 1100. Are you crazy? Turning down free advice from the King himself? He's not the King. Not anymore. Steve, that's him. - That's Elvis Presley! - Aw. No way. Elvis has black hair. Monica saw him at the party the other night. It's definitely him. I'm telling you, it's him. If it's him, then maybe he'll sing us a little song. - Steve, come on. - Don't. Just having a little fun, babe. Hey, you! Hey, sideburns. I got a little chick over there wants to hear you sing a song. Oh, yeah? Why don't you bring her to my concert in Pittsburgh on Sunday? - You ain't scared, are ya? - I didn't say that, did I? - Steve, you've caused enough trouble. - Why don't you shut up? Hey, hey!

Yeah, my mom loves those rowboat rides. - Johnny! - Listen. Seriously, Elvis. You gotta get outta here. There's a crowd of people out front, and it's gettin' bigger. I got an idea. This is how we can get rid of those people. Excuse me! If you came here... to see Elvis Presley, you'd stand a better chance... of seeing him tonight. He's performing at the Kennedy High School Talent Show. They're selling out real fast. - You're really playing the talent show, huh? - Yep. What are you gonna do? Fly in your whole orchestra? Uh-uh. You and your band are gonna back me up. ' MY band? - Yep. No way, man. We got cut from that show. They don't like us. And those guys hate rock 'n' roll. - They hate rock 'n' roll, huh? - Mm-hmm.

"cause I never knew what it was like to have a dad." Now I do. Come on, man. We've gotta go. I'll be right there. When I first met you, I didn't like you at all. I thought you were the meanest... most arrogant, selfish little bastard I'd ever met. Then got to thinkin' how much you reminded me of me when I was your age. I forgot how good it felt to be a bad-ass, to be a rebel. You made me feel like Elvis again. Hey, Elvis. Thanks for tonight. I know you did that for me. Hell, no, kid. I did it for rock 'n' roll. Hey, Elvis! You're still the King. There must be lights burning brighter. Somewhere. Got to be birds flying higher In a sky more blue If I can dream of a better land where all my brothers walk hand-in-hand. Tell me why Oh, why, oh, why can't my dream come true. Oh, why. There must be peace and understanding sometime. Strong winds of promise, that will blow away the doubt and fear. If can dream of a warmer sun. Where hope keeps shining on everyone. Tell me why Oh, why, Oh, why won't that sun appear... we're lost in a cloud. With too much rain. We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain. But as long as a man. Has the strength to dream... he can redeem his soul and fly. Deep in my heart. There's a trembling question still I am sure That the answer's The answer's gonna come somehow. Out there in the dark. There's a beckoning candle Yeah. And while I can think While I can talk while I can stand while I can walk while I can dream I'm feelin' my dream. Come true. Whoa. Right now. Let it come true right now Oh yeah. Oh, yeah. Break it, burn it. Drag it all around, Twist it, turn it, you can't tear it down 'cause every minute every hour.
