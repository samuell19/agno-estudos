Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. 10th May, 1981 My dear Passengers of the Night, it's May 10th, or the 11th now, and I'm Vanda Dorval, taking you through once more to 4 a.m. Call in to tell me your experiences of this special night. Here, nothing has changed. We're still on 45 24 70 00. Before we take our first call, music. With Barbara singing Regarde. THE PASSENGERS OF THE NIGHT Hi, grandpa. Matthias, how are you? - Good, and you? - Fine, thanks. Nice to see you. Where've you been? With Carlos. Doing math. Very funny. Should I stay tonight? No, I'm fine. You go. Matthias, you got my ciggies? - No, forgot. - You forgot? So give me my cash back. Grandpa, hi there. Nice surprise. - All right? - Yeah. I'm all right. So you're active politically? Yeah, but mom won't let me go to protests. You have exams coming up and better things to do. You passed your exams and did nothing better. Come on. Here, Matthias. Thanks, grandpa. You're sure? That's far too much. If all Judith does is buy ciggies. Thanks. Need a hand, mom? No, thanks, sweetie. Well, I'll fix myself some dinner. Your separation is final? He's... He's rented an apartment. Near Saint-Lazare, with his girlfriend. So... I can help out. That's not the issue, dad. I need to find work fast. How? You've never worked. Thanks. A great help. Sorry. That's not what I meant. I know. Of course, you'll find something. There are lots of jobs that require common sense and sensitivity. Lots of new sectors are opening up. With new jobs. It's already changing, dad. But I'll mention that I'm very sensitive on my resumé. I'm sorry. I'm being ridiculous. Sorry. Anyway, you go home. It's late. Matthias will walk with you. The Cold War's most visible effect, as you are well aware, was the creation of two antagonistic blocs centered on the URSS and the USA. This polarization undermines other states' unity. They are also cut in half. The Allies merge occupied zones to form West Germany in May 1949. The Soviet-occupied zone forms East Germany in October 1949. To undermine antagonism An unoccupied zone for allies I'm an ally of your occupied zone At the end of the war, Berlin is subjected to an occupation by four parties. Davies? Hold on a minute. Why come to this class? I don't call roll, so why bother turning up? My classroom is no place for writing poetry. For inspiration, try looking elsewhere. What are you interested in? What really interests you? What I don't like is you pretending. You pretend to listen and to be here. I think you're old enough to own what you want. You want to be a poet. So own it. I don't want to be a poet. You seem to float along. Gliding. How can you glide over things at your age? Do you speak Occitan, Youri? No, I've never been into regionalism. I prefer to be understood. Quite the ambition, to be understood. When you dress as a woman, are you understood? It's something else, my secret garden. Does your wife know you crossdress? I mean, have you been able to share it with her? "Share" would be over the top but sometimes she sees me. What are you doing in the dark? Can't you sleep? And why are you home so late? It's intense, lots of meetings. How was your first day at work? First and last, you mean. I got fired. What happened? I forgot to save the file. What? The inventory file. I... I spent all day filling it out and forgot to save when I closed it. It wasn't saved. - It can't be true. - It is. I'm out of my depth. Mom, I showed you. - Auto-save. I showed you. - No. I did. Your grandfather's right. I'm useless. Don't ever say that. He spouts some bullshit. He doesn't change. Hello. Hello. Come on in. Take a seat. Thanks. Elisabeth. Yes, of course. Elisabeth. From La Rochelle, right? I suppose, but I've been in Paris a long time now. You left La Rochelle at what age? Sixteen. This is where you record the program? Most of the time, yes. It feels like we're on home ground. Well... I was very touched by your letter. The honesty it exuded. Thank you. So you're an avid listener? Yes. Sleep doesn't come easy to me, let's say. I've listened to you from the start. Going back to The Night Road. I knew it wasn't only truckers we kept awake. A drink? Yes. What have you done before now, Elisabeth? I studied psychology. Some secretarial work. Then I had my children so... When I tried to go back, I had health issues so... Why go back to work now? I'm separated from my husband. - He left me. - I understand. I understand. You say in your letter, you'll do just about anything. Yes, as required, I can... The switchboard, for example? You'd be interested? - Switchboard? - Telephone switchboard. Francis is leaving us. We're looking for someone. I'll introduce you. He'll explain it. Then we'll try you out. If it works out, great. If not, then no. What I'm looking for is someone who connects with the listener. As well as being able to filter, welcome and get on air an experience that can be shared. It involves sensing things. Sensing the truth, I'd say. And with regard to... more pragmatic matters, the pay's terrible. Our budget is constantly being reduced. And since the advent of late-night TV, radio has lost its monopoly of the night. Any questions? No. Well, one. When do you want me to start? Actually, right now. Jot down name, number, time of call. When you're good, you motion to Agostini, if he ever stops talking... You motion to him, three. You press three and you hang up. All done. Now? Take it. - This is a call? - Yes. Good evening, what's your name? Evening, Henri. What would you like to discuss with... with Vanda, sorry. I'll put you on hold briefly and I'll be right back. Hold the line, Henri. Motion to him first. Three. I press three. You hang up and you're good. Sorry, I didn't see you there. No, it's my fault. I dozed off. With your coat on? I couldn't sleep. I went down for a walk. When do your classes start? Late, this morning. You left your clutter out again. Morning. I know, too old for it. No, it's not you. I don't smell too fresh. Better keep your distance. Okay, I'll keep my distance. And make your hot chocolate. Thanks. You never say how you're feeling. Just fine. For sure? Stop, mom. Starting the day on a downer. And why just stand there? Eat something. You're so thin. You're right. Wacko! You nearly landed on her. No worries. I saw you, Leila. All right, kids? If anything's off tomorrow morning, you guys are banned, okay? Sure, dad, we'll clear up. In that case, welcome. To see the game, we're watching here later. It's hot. That's the booze. You're super pretty with your cheeks glowing. You'll let me read your writing. - You'd like that? - For sure. Carlos has read it. Yeah, and he made fun of me. Matthias! You're kidding me. We scored! - Take a look. - Gotta go. All right. So, you want to contribute to which part of the show? Yes. That means coming in. We have a visitor. Okay. Hold the line, I'll be right back. She looks so young. A kid. A high schooler. Evening. - Are you Talulah? - Yes. I'm Elisabeth. We spoke on the phone. Okay. Thanks for coming in. Your letter touched us all. You know how the program works? Yes. So, Vanda will be sitting there. And you'll be in that booth. You'll be in the shadows, so Vanda can't see you. Okay. What's Your Name? Dear Passengers, here's a favorite of yours, according to your numerous letters. We thought we'd try to make it a regular slot. Starting tonight, with a new visitor. What's your name? Talulah. Talulah? That's pretty, Talulah. That's your real name? Yes, it's my name. Do you know what it means? Does it mean anything in particular? No, I don't think so. I see you come from St. Malo. Yes, not far from St. Malo. And since you arrived in Paris? No fixed abode, I'm always on the move. Hotel rooms or squats. Do your parents help you out? You keep in touch? Do I have to answer? I don't feel like talking about it. Mom and dad, it's not very interesting. Talulah, it's up to you. I can't make you but... You asked to come here. You know what we're about here. Talking about yourself. About your past, your childhood. You have a very young voice. A voice of childhood, perhaps. How old are you? Eighteen. Eighteen... So you're very young. It's funny here, though. How come? - The studio, you mean? - Yes. I didn't imagine it like this when... - Listening to those voices. - Really? How did you imagine it? Much smaller. Like a sort of dressing room or... Or that thing for confession. You ever went to confession? No. Never. I was thinking we could piggy-back one of Lenoir's live gigs. At Le Palace or Les Bains-Douches, shake things up. Sure, let's brainstorm it. I bumped into him earlier. Next time, I'll mention it. See you, Vanda. So, how's it going? Vanda's happy, at least. You're getting the hang of it? Sure. It feels a bit hit-and-miss still, and I'd like Vanda's feedback but I hope I'm up to speed. Don't overthink it with Vanda. If you don't cut it, she'll be sure to let you know. I wonder how much longer the tryout lasts. The tryout? It's done, over. You totally tried out. No way. She didn't tell you? What a sourpuss! I'm pleased you're here, at least. See you. Tomorrow, then. Colleague. Are you okay? What are you doing? The café opens in ten minutes or so. I'm sorry about earlier. Sorry about what? I dunno, I didn't know what to say. I couldn't find the words. I sucked. I messed it all up. Not at all. You were great, Talulah, honestly. You must be freezing. You have a place to go after the café? After the café, we'll see. Grab your gear. You can't stay here. Come home with me. We have a spare room upstairs. - I don't want to intrude. - You won't. I'm inviting you. Come on. This way. My ex-husband insisted on buying this with the apartment. We use it to store stuff. You need to make space for the mattress but... My daughter comes up sometimes to be alone. Thanks, but I can't. Not at all. Okay, I'll let you settle in. If you want a shower, just come downstairs. All right. Here... There you go. You can stay a few days. But... It's a bit tricky with my two teens. And I'm on my own. I understand. It's really cool of you. Well, goodnight then. What's left of it. This'll come in handy. Holy shit! What's up? Tell me. Gimme the binoculars. Don't be selfish, as usual. Put the strap on. Don't need it. How old, d'you think? Dunno. Seventeen, eighteen... She waved to me. You think she's done it? You bet. No way. Think so? No doubt about it. Quit acting like you don't care. Shit. Who's that? No clue. I hope it's not mom. We should be at school. Hi. You're Elisabeth's son? Yes. She told me to come by for a shower. I'm upstairs. She didn't say? Is it a bad time? No, come in. I mean, mom didn't say but... Thanks, that's cool. Talulah. Matthias. How does my mother know a chick like her? Maybe I should call her. What if she's lying? Are you nuts? If she's lying, you kick her out? No, she's here now. We're keeping her. She's at least eighteen, for sure. You saw her? The way she looked at you? Who the heck is she? Thanks, that's much better. Need anything else? I already butted in enough. Bye. Shit, that smells good, dude. - Smell! - Stop it. I'm keeping it. I can never do this. You try? Sure. You set a place for Talulah? You invited her for lunch? Yeah, why not? I don't know. Who is she? She's only here for a few days. You know where she's from? Yes, come in. It's open. Hello. Come in. You were already in radio before working with Vanda? It's all new. She hid it for days. I didn't hide anything. It's no crime to take your time. I wanted to be sure before telling you. You're in 10th grade? Okay? How's it going? It's going. Not really going. I got a message from your assistant principal. Any idea what he wants? Most likely, not to give you a medal. - Over-dramatic, as usual. - I'm over-dramatic? If you flunk this year, you're on your own. You think you'll go back? No. I left after 9th grade. It's been years. And other courses? You can get funding. Nothing appeals? Actually... what you do on the radio, I'd enjoy that, I think. Listening to people, talking to them, helping them. I mean, it helped me, listening to your show at night. Not again. It's several times a day right now. Here we go. This is it. Come on, Matthias. Three for Birdy, please. It started ten minutes ago. Sorry. No problem, tell us how it starts. Trouble is, I can't let anyone in more than five minutes late. Come on, please! No, honestly. He wasn't having it. Pain in the ass! Let's catch the next one. Come on. What's she doing? Come on! What are we doing? If I get the chance tonight, I'll grab it, for sure. I feel compelled to stay up all night now and then. Don't take it personally. It's just me. Sorry. Sit down! I never said I don't like going out with you. If you're home at a reasonable hour. It's reasonable for me even if not for you. I'll sleep tomorrow. You have your tennis. It's cool. Shit, I'm sorry. I'm greatly attracted to you but it's under control, as you requested. - Careful! What if she comes in? - Don't worry. It's discreet, don't worry. It's only because you're scared she'll see us? Stop, Octave! You're crazy. I don't agree with it. I respect no girl more than you. There's something about you that's virginal. The indomitable air of a ferocious Amazon. I daren't touch you. I can't bear anyone else touching you. Imagining you in a man's arms is unbearable for me. Especially the men you frequent, whose animality is pathetically bestial. Lucky we got the wrong film. It's a roll of the dice. Home, maybe? Look, Octave, I need to be alone. I feel compelled to stay up all night now and then. C'mon, let's go. Bestial! Is that all you can say? Bestial! You're bestial, too, in your own way. So, what did you say then? What could I say? That dress looks great on you. A real change. I don't know. I'm sorting through them. Good film? Yeah. Do you plan on working tonight? Why? What do you mean, why? I imagine you have homework. Already did it. Lying, Octave! Shut up! How was it with Talulah? She's nice, isn't she? Super nice. I feel bad, imagining her up there. Cooped up alone. You'll adopt all the local stray dogs? What? Miss Lefty's scared of squatters? My ass, Matthias. You're obviously into her. Bullshit. She isn't like that. I find her very touching. Just imagine, practically on the street, at her age. With her father halfway mad. What do you think? Tell me if I'm being foolish. Maybe I'm being foolish. You're not being foolish. You forgot this, I think. Thanks. - Who's the band? - Television. From New York. I'll lend it to you. Great. Thanks. Come in. By the way, we had a chat with mom. If you want to stay longer or... just stay, period, you can. Well, thanks. You okay, Talulah? Don't cry for no reason. Sorry. You're all so kind, as well. It's okay, don't worry. Sure? Okay... I'll be going. Do you want to... Do you want to smoke with me? If you want. I know. You gotta see this... Beautiful. Come on. Want some? I'm obsessing about the film. You liked it? Didn't seem that way. I wasn't sure earlier. Some films, you only like them way later. Or when you see them again. Depends on your mood or whatever. - You see a lot of movies? - Actually... Mostly when it's cold out. More and more, sure. I just enjoy it. You forget yourself. It's as if... What time is it? 9:07. Shit, gotta go. Here, finish it, if you want. Sorry, I'm really late. What for? Want to play? Cookie? I'm on two packs a night now. So, let's talk to our first listener. Who may you be? Hello? Hello, you're live on the radio. Who's there? Vanda... It's Robin. Missed me, bitch? Cut him off. I'll come show you a good... Hoping for a more inspired listener, here's some music. I told you, don't put that nutcase through! What could I do? His voice is different with me. He changes his name. The number, dammit! Any doubts, get a number and call back. Identify the guy for sure. - And short-circuit him. - He calls from a payphone. Different every time. You okay? Don't take it personally. It happened to Francis lots of times. Vanda knows it. She has to take out her anger on someone. She's right. I sensed something was off when he called but even so... I put the call through. I was so dumb. Honestly, don't beat yourself up. Know what? Vanda's scary sometimes. She intimidates me even. One day, I saw her crying like you. After one particular clunker, she took it out on us. I never expected to see her cry. Now, when she shouts, I keep it in perspective. Sorry. No, I am. What's wrong? You look out of sorts. It's okay, I'm fine. It's just a bit awkward. I'm in a complicated financial situation. But I may have something... There's a job going at the library. Part-time. As I understand it, Eric pays you nothing. Of course I can help you. Why didn't you ask me earlier? I didn't want to. It's complicated for you, too. Even so... I'm really... I'm sorry, Dad. I'll pay it all back. That has no importance. Of course, it does. It's important! It's money you might need to fall back on. By the way, this time, I remembered. I'm not sure it's a good idea to... encourage him in that direction. He's... He's already so distracted. A poet in the family is fine by me. I find him so disconcerting. He's so secretive. Takes after someone, right? 9 pm at Le Grand Pavois Indiana Jones I'll go ahead. Okay, be right there. Do you want to come by? I'd like that, but I really need some rest. Catch up on some sleep. There's so much I haven't touched for weeks. Paperwork and stuff. I don't know how to say this, it's nothing personal... I think you're lovely, honestly, and more besides. But I just had a bad breakup and I don't see it, really. But it's my fault. I thought, I don't know... You're mad at me? No. Well then, see you tomorrow. Elisabeth? Talulah. Come in. I'm alone. You're showering? What's wrong? You know... For hours, I've been leaving my husband messages. My ex-husband. You have great timing. I need to break out of the spiral. Like messages of despair? Exactly. Nothing but despair. I swing between crying and insulting him. Every time, the machine cuts me off. I call back. It's pathetic. It's not pathetic. Men are bastards, anyway. Now, it seems mad to have had only one man in my life. Only one, just think. What a waste. Right? A little bird. You're like a little bird. Nobody ever told you? Maybe. Even so, I'm right. Men are often bastards. I don't know. Why else did your husband walk out? Abandon you all? Maybe I should've left him. It was broken for some time. In one way, he was brave enough to do it. Where's Gonzo? Over there. Gonzo, someone to see you. You scared them off. Hi, Christine. - Long time, no see. - Yeah. How you doing? Got anything for us? Check it out. Let's go on the bridge. Really? Yeah. The guy back there called you Christine. Forget it, he was high. Christine suits you. Don't. I hate that name. It's so ugly. - I like it. - Don't, I said. I'll call you Philippe. You look like a Philippe. Give me that. You're kidding? Give me it. Give me it! Why'd you jump? I'm so sorry. That was so stupid of us. Of you, you mean. Take it off. Your sweater, too. Take it off. Sorry. Here. What's going on? Where'd you go? You reek of alcohol. Can't I trust you for a minute? How old are you? You're soaking. Take your jacket off. I'm not a girl for you. Dear Passengers, today is a special day. It's the birthday of our dedicated Elisabeth, always here for you at the controls of the switchboard. I'll pass onto her all your letters. Happy birthday, my dear. My Elisabeth. Thank you for submitting to our publishing house. We regret to inform you your text did not receive approval. We encourage you to submit more work for consideration. Someone here for you. Three times this week. Your days, coincidentally. Silly! Good evening. Did you like it? Not really. I'm sorry. My colleague recommended it to me. I haven't read it but usually she has impeccable taste. I think I prefer crime novels. Plots you get tied up in. In any case, you read a lot. Or very fast. People rarely borrow so many books. I have a long commute. I feel sick if I don't read. I'm slightly claustrophobic. Once, I was in a real panic, without a book, so I started reading on a loop the terms and conditions for reimbursement of tickets. You know, on the... Did it work? Not exactly. There you go. Your card. Thanks. Can I ask your name? Elisabeth. I'm Hugo. Nice to meet you. Bye, Elisabeth. Thanks. Goodbye. Excuse me... I lost my nerve, then I thought it's silly. I wanted to ask you for a drink. I don't know if it's all right but if I chicken out now I will next time too. If you want, yes. I finish in an hour. Great. I'll be outside the library, if that's okay. Yes. - You're back? - I forgot this. I'm off. I found these. Put them to one side. Is the book any good? Not bad. I finished it. Leave it for you? No, I've got to study. See you. See you. Have a good evening. Are you going or not? Not into him? Sure I am. Too much maybe. He's young, though. Even better, right? Lucky you. I'd jump at the chance. Shit, I forgot my lipstick. Hold on, use mine, if you want. Thanks. It feels like a disguise. I mean, it's so long since Eric... You're beautiful. Don't worry, you're very beautiful. You think? There he is! Gotta run. Thanks! You don't mind? No. It's rugged and fragile. Like you. You say so but you don't know me. Yes, I do. Some people, it feels like you've always known them. You never felt that? No. I guess it's because of previous lives or whatever. I recall the first time I saw you. It was at the library. You had a weird old lady insisting you find her a history of Venice. You were so gentle with her. I stayed at the library on purpose. With nothing to do, just... to watch you. Hello. We're here to see Judith. Her mom and brother. All right, come in. Judith, visitors! Show them in, I'm coming! Living room's there. Okay. It's so chic. She has expensive tastes. - I burned dinner. - What's that? It was duck. - Hi there. - Yeah. - Okay? - And you? Hi, mom. I brought you flowers. Lot of reading. Thank you. That's my roomie's. Anyway, this is shit. I'll put it outside for now. And get a vase. How many of you live here? Permanently? Four. Permanently, as you put it. With people dropping in, it can go up to ten. Really? Lots of people drop in. I hope food's shared. Don't cook for everyone. Very funny. They're beautiful. - You'll show us around? - For sure. So, shall we eat out? No, we can stay here. Let me get used to it. It's my first time visiting my daughter. What's up, mom? I don't know. It's nothing, a funny feeling. Why funny? I don't know... I don't think I realized you'd moved out. For real, I mean. I know you moved out. But I guess I felt deep down, you'd gone on vacation. And you'd come home. Now, coming here, I... Mom! My little mommy! That's right, make fun of me. So, picnic here? Scout camp's got pasta? You can cook now? Better than you. I saw dad not so long ago. It feels like he's turning sour. I mean, reactionary. I don't get him anymore. How did you put up with him so long? I mean, were you and dad in love? Of course. I was in love, yes. But with hardly anything in common? You guys, to start with. All right. That's collateral damage, almost. It's not like he encouraged you, is it? When you wanted to do things? I don't like you saying that. He was very supportive during my breast cancer. I think he wanted out. We weren't getting on. But he stayed. Actually, speaking of him, you should know, I started looking for an apartment. Really? I think he wants to sell. Where are you looking? Where, I don't know. What? I don't think I can afford bigger than a studio or one-bedroom place. In other words, I can't keep all your stuff. You need to pick it up. I'm being kicked out? Not too fast. There's no one else. That's no reason. It is, a bit. - What? - A bit, it is. I wonder if she has a boyfriend. She didn't tell you? - She never tells me. - Me neither. Are you okay? What's wrong, beautiful? What's going on? Are you okay? Look at me, Talulah. What's wrong? Let's take her upstairs. Hold on tight. Help me lift her. Come on. Lean on me. She isn't up? No. I stayed with her most of the night. She was delirious. Are you working today? I don't remember. No. Can you stay with her or not? Sure, I'll stay. You saw her arms? We did a program with Vanda last year, on Place Stalingrad, and I saw kids like her. If she goes out, she'll relapse. What can we do? Maybe we need to institutionalize her. Hospitalize her? I don't see anything else. What the heck? - Sending her to an asylum? - Sorry? An asylum? I mean a hospital, for her own safety. A psych ward? I don't know. I have no idea. I'm no doctor. I'm unsure how to help. She came here for us to intern her? She came here for us to protect her from herself. I don't know how to protect her from it. I'm not a doctor. And I'm not her mother. We're not moving her. All they'll do is mess her up and kick her back out. Look, I need to get dressed for the library. Let's talk later to work something out. We'll have to take turns, won't we? I don't give a shit about audience ratings. You know why it's less prestigious, a nighttime show? Because there's no competition? No competition means lower quality. It's how the world works. He's madly in love or he works nights? No, he's an insomniac. No kidding? No kidding. - Shall I introduce you? - Another time. Go, enjoy it. - You must be freezing. - I'm good. - I missed you. - Same here. At my place, we'll hunker down till tomorrow. No, I can't. Talulah's at home. It's my turn. So we hunker down there. Okay, but the kids mustn't see you. Likewise Talulah. How is Talulah? She sleeps a lot. She sleeps and eats. Like a baby, you mean? Yes, exactly. Like a baby. I won't disrupt your writing space? Anywhere's a writing space. If you need anything, just come down and ask. The shower hasn't moved. Thank you. Really, thank you. I'll let you rest up. Hold on. Stay with me, will you? I could take you out to the movies, if you want. Maybe Full Moon in Paris is still showing. You know that actress died? Three years ago. I read an article about her and her death. Her heart. You can't be serious. How come she died? Once is an accident. And then, twice is coincidence. Three times is destiny. Wake up. - Wake up. - What time is it? 7:34. Shit! Your son's still here? No, I heard him leave. My place tonight? Let's meet here, don't you think? Never my place, then? I love our brief encounters but I'm not 13 years old. All right. See you at your place. See you tonight. Maybe. Silly! Here, I thought you... Elisabeth? Come on. You relapsed? It's the only time. I'm warning you, I won't say this again. If I see anything like that here again, or catch you taking that shit, I'll show you the door. I'll kick you out, got it? Back on the streets. Why do you do that? Good god! Why take that shit? Sorry. And you're all so... I don't think I can do it. Do what? Live normally. I think I was born like this. No. Nobody's born like that. Sometimes, I... I get the feeling I'll only feel good if I'm getting my fix. If I'm floating from one place to the next. I don't belong anywhere. I really don't belong anywhere. You need to find a job. There are courses. You can't stay like this. What's up? Talulah's not feeling great. We can go get some air. I'll take her to the radio with me. Tell me what's going on. Not now. Why? Talulah relapsed. Don't get involved. Why not? We'll talk later. Come on. It's four minutes past midnight, and I'm leaving you in the company of Elisabeth Davies, sitting in for Vanda Dorval. Our Vanda, who will be back very soon. Wishing her a speedy recovery. Thanks, José. Evening, everybody. Evening, dear Passengers. No, it's not Vanda tonight but Elisabeth, accompanying you through the night. Let's welcome our first listener... Who are you? Evening, Elisabeth. My name's Colette. Evening, Colette. You're my first Night Bird. It means a lot to me. What would you like to tell us about? I wanted to share something that happened last month, and that is still ongoing today. Here goes. I'm 38 years old. I grew up in Sète. I'm so stressed, I don't know why. - You know which way you'll vote? - Idiot! Don't do anything stupid. You little first-time voter! Scared? I'm running late. - Sorry. - You okay? - You voted? - No, waited for you. Let's go. Evening. Enjoy the film. - You're not going to see it? - I have, lots of times. - You mind if I do? - Go ahead. So, how's it going? Well. The manager's a nice guy. Some audience members are a bit weird, but hey. And I see lots of films. And your audition? Any news? A washout. For a movie called Love Without Pity, it seems appropriate. To the pleasure of your company. Here with me. Want to put Joe on? You've made the crème caramel? It's kind of a family tradition. Mom's crème caramel accompanied by Joe Dassin. She told me you contribute to her show. - You're inseparable. - I did her last few nights. Elisabeth's awesome on the mic. Evening, dear Passengers, this is Elisabeth Dorval, taking you through the night. All you can do is mock. You are derision incarnate. Say what you like about Vanda, she reached out to me when I was at rock bottom. It took some doing, though. What you did. Let's go. Come on. Come on, no choice. What started all this? All what? The crème caramel and Joe Dassin. I don't recall. C'mon, sunbeam. My future politician. Don't go thinking you can get out of it. If you did not exist I'd be nothing but one more jot In this world that comes and goes I would feel so lost I would need you so And if you did not exist I think I'd have found by now The secret of life and why Simply to create you And to look at you Isn't that record mine? No, it was your father's. He gave it to me, I think. Yes, could be. Help yourselves to the records. I'm not sure I'll take them in the move. We'll see when you find a place. Still no prospects? Not really. I struggle to picture it. But Hugo has a friend who's moving, and his apartment's great, apparently. Hugo? Come off it. Don't act prim and proper. You know I'm seeing someone. We'll see him in five years. Like the apartment. It will feel funny, leaving here. It wasn't the life we imagined when we moved in... but we loved the place, right? I'm glad you came with me. Will the film be any good? Who cares! What matters is being here. I don't want to grace a bad picture, even as an extra. Alexis is so cool. He lined me up an audition. I gave him your home number. It's no problem? He's hitting on you. He just wants your number. No, you don't get it. He's the casting director who hired us. We're here thanks to him. Don't you think the timing's off? The movie biz could be unhealthy for you. Hanging out with film people will make me shoot up? - I was at it before them. - I know. I apologize. Look, I know you worry about me. I thank you for being there. You, your mother and sister. But I'm not made of sugar. We need to talk. You know, I can't be your friend or... Or your stand-in brother. Or whatever. Because... This will sound strange but... But I love you. I thought it was all over and meant nothing anymore, but no. Three years, I've been mad about you. I'm not asking for anything. For you to love me even. Anyway, if it's an issue, say so, and we won't see each other. We can just co-exist. You're good at it when you want. A little mouse, taking a shower, leaving no traces... I understand. What do you understand? I understand you love me. I'll know that now. Matthias, I waited for you to leave, I didn't want to hurt you. I don't much like goodbyes, and it hurts me too. A lot. There's so much I want to tell you and can't. Sometimes it's like everything I touch gets broken and dirty. Or it disappears. I want you to be Matthias forever. I often think of moments we spent together. Well, you see, they're like gifts. They are mine alone. That helps me. I'm scared I'll spoil them. I'll be thinking of all of you. I'll never forget you all. Talulah. You okay? We're getting there. Even if there's lots to do. With four of us, we're good. It's dumb but I... I've never been without my children. I never imagined myself without them. And now, they're so grown-up. I feel useless. Like I'll never make it. You'll help me? I think, deep down... you're a lioness. Sometimes I wonder if I'm any use to you. Why do you say that? Because... I couldn't do it without you. You gave me strength. It's true. It is! What else could they do? The markets are against them. Like Chirac was the only enforcer. Mauroy and Delors had it covered. You guys all have short memories. It's the charity pick-up. Judith and Matthias... A quick pause? Cease fire? We're just talking. I have something to show you. Over here. Come on. There you go. Open it. That one's for you. And that's for you. Thanks. What is it? Open it. They're nothing special, but I came across them yesterday when I was tidying up, and I thought of you. Those are my writings. Not a patch on your work, nothing literary, just a kind of journal I kept when your father left me. You kept a journal? Sure. You're surprised? It helped me stick it out. They're not confessions. That's why I can give it to you. It's more ideas that occurred to me. Images, too. Images of you two. I thought maybe... Anyway... Open it up. Your turn. It's a fertility goddess. Your father gave it to me when we went to Africa. I miscarried before I had you. I never told you both, but I was scared you wouldn't be born. So I figured the statuette brought me luck because you arrived. You were so strong, so resolute. And still are today. My super strong girl. I remember the statuette. It was... at the hospital when you were sick. On the table next to you. Your father brought it in for me. He'd become kind of superstitious, too. My little girl. My darling. What's going on here? Nothing, don't worry. Tuesday, 11th March, 1984. I woke up late this morning. I don't really recollect my dream, only we were all there. All four of us, like before. Half-asleep, I tried to continue it as long as possible. It felt kind of warm, eternal. The light of day couldn't hold it back. Over breakfast, I read to you both the words of a writer on Vanda Dorval's show last night. "There shall be what we were for others. "Smatterings, "fragments of us that perhaps they thought they glimpsed. "There shall be dreams of us that they nurtured. "And we were never the same. "Each time, we were magnificent strangers, "passengers of the night that they invented, "like fragile shadows "in old, long-forgotten bedroom mirrors." It made you both smile. And you said, Why don't you write a letter to Vanda, too?" Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
