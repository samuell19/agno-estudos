MOSFILM MOSFILM (USSR) and TOHO EIGA (Japan) co-production What do you think? She has talent. But it has to be developed. I agree. What's her name? Yuriko. Thank you. We'll invite her to study at the Bolshoi Theater. One, two, three! So you're going to Moscow? Aren't you happy for me? It's not that. - Are you going to miss me? - Don't overestimate yourself, silly. It'll probably be hard. Probably. Besides, it's a new country. Will you manage? I Will. Alright, let's have a great farewell party. The road you're traveling is endless Don't give up The sun you're going towards Will rise again tomorrow Thank you! Your Russian is good. Don't forget about us. If you do, we'll find you in Moscow. Tetsuya will turn into a bear and chase you. Goodbye, Tokyo! KOMAKI KURIKHARA OLEG VIDOV MOSCOW, MY LOVE Uncle Nagawa! Yuriko, my little girl! How you've grown up! This is Mr Nagawa, our firm's representative in Moscow. The girl is happy. She's going to study at the Bolshoi Theater. Préparation! Watch your hands. Round the left shoulder! Keep your legs tight! Pause! Fifth position! How' s Yuriko? She doesn't have our training. And it's always much more difficult to re-learn. - She's talented. - She is indeed. But if she could do nothing at all, it would be much easier. Yuriko! Yuriko! Don't loosen your back. And keep your shoulder-blades together. Also, stretch your leg all the way to your toes. Even] day when you enter this building... raise your head and look at the sculpture on the pediment. Apollo is being pulled by four sweating horses. This is the ratio of inspiration and hard work in our trade. Got it? Now go. Yes. Hello, Yuriko. I'm alright. Except, yesterday, I realized that I haven't seen you for six months. It's not that it upset me that much. It was just a thought. It made me think how fast our lives go by. Still... Why do you write so rarely? Hello! Hello, Tetsuya. I'm alright too. I'm happy! I'm so happy! Ballet occupies all my time. It's my god and my king. It's a very harsh god. By the end of the day, I'm exhausted. I'm sorry I don't write more often. Hello, Yuriko. I'm alright, as usual. And you write as rarely as before. But it's boring to write about it every time. Yesterday, I interviewed young people in the underground. "How would you feel if your boyfriend or girlfriend was away from you for a long time?" They talked about feeling sad, can you imagine that? It sounded ridiculous. Still... Do write more often. Alright, everyone! Get in position! Come on, quick! Stop talking! Let's go, préparation! One, two! Allongé! Stretch your toes! And now slowly to arabesque. Then bend, twist! And out! Gentlemen, be more gentle with ladies. Ladies, you be more gracious. Don't forget that you're princesses. Hello, Yuriko. I'm still alright. All day, I meet young, pretty girls in the street. It's so exciting! If one doesn't reciprocate my feelings (and that also happens)... I simply find another one. But, of course, nothing can replace friendship between men. Don't get upset with my jokes. And do write more often, please. Keep your elbows up. Now raise your arms. Loosen your hands. Now allongé! Stretch your arm out. Softer! Hello, Tetsuya. I'm alright. But my god is so chary of praise... and I'm not that gifted, after all. I'm sorry I write so rarely. Yuriko! Tomorrow is May Day. I know. We're going to gather at Volodya's place. He's the one who draws. - I won't come. - Why not? He's a wonderful sculptor. You should see his workshop. - Is he a sculptor? - Yes. I'll go for a walk in the city. Alone. I want to get some air finally. I think you're just in a bad mood. I'll give you Volodya's address. And here is the time. Will you come? I don't know. Probably not. Hello! Hello. - I got this address... - Oh yes. Only it's 9, not 6. But it's okay. - I was supposed to come at 9? - You're right on time, Yuriko. Don't worry. At 9, it's going to be noisy and crowded. And now, it's nice and quiet here. Not everyone can party. Me, I can't. - I'm not the most fun person. - Me neither. - Can I see your sculptures? - Of course. Come in. Hey there! Hello, Volodya! The table isn't ready yet! Why have you invited everyone? We have everything. We just need to lay the table. Volodya, let's show Yuriko the fireworks. Yuriko, come with us, we'll admire the fireworks. Was it someone's prank? You're confused. You take another look. No, nobody's there. You turn around and walk toward the house, but then you come face to face with Prince. Your eyes are very important here. Your eyes light up instantly, but then you lower your head. When Giselle sees Prince for the first time, love is sparkled. But she doesn't want to show it. She's embarrassed. He takes your hand. He wants to caress you. You lower your head. You take your hand away, bow to him, and run back to the house. He stops you and says, "Don't go!" He takes you by your arm. You both like it and feel shy. He walks with you a bit. You keep your head down all the time. He keeps trying to look you in the eye. And then he sees your feelings. And he says, "I love you. I swear!" You take his hand... put it down and say, "No". And you pick a flower to tell your fortune. Dear Tetsuya, something has finally changed. And the most important thing is, I've staﬂed rehearsing Giselle. I knock on wood! I rehearse together with my friend Tanya. She's an experienced ballerina. Tetsuya, I get so tired! If only you knew! Don't forget about the heels! Are you in love or what? I don't like talking about these things. - Speed up a bit. - We're almost there. There they are. Their rehearsal has just finished. - And there's Yuriko. - Where? - Pull over here. - I can't park here. - See you. - Good luck! Volodya, it's you! Hello, Yuriko. You look sad and unhappy. Is anything wrong? Yes. I can't show love at first sight through dance. I'm sorry to hear that. But you'll figure it out, I'm sure. All stories about ballerinas are the same. At first, they can't dance. Then, they fall in love, dance, and marry the ballet master. - Why the ballet master? - I don't know. This is how these stories end. You're joking. And I'm very unhappy right now. You're less unhappy now. Everybody stops believing in themselves at some point. They want to escape to some deserted place. But then, they are seized by such a desire to go back... that the workshop seems a paradise. Yes! If I don't dance for a day or two... I stop feeling alive. You seem more cheerful now. Do you feel better? I do, Volodya. I'm glad I met you. But you're not a serious person. I can't be serious with you. Why is that? Because you're a mirage. It seems like you've come down from a Japanese engraving. I'm afraid that if I turn away, you'll hide behind the frame. And I'll be left alone. Why were you drawing me then? - Because I liked it. - You like the way I dance? The way you dance, walk, talk. I like looking at you. You know what, before you return to your engraving... I'd like to make a sculpture of you. What do you say? Okay. Good. Hello, Yuriko. I don't expect any letters from you anymore. I've accepted it. It's even better this way. It develops one's imagination. I'm sitting here, so far away, and imagine what you're doing. Oh, I forgot to say - I'm alright. Yes, like that! Good! Good! Now head up! Stretch and... You need to do better at the end. Softer. You're too lyrical. Do you understand? Goodbye. Tanya, come in. Oh, I forgot to tell you. Volodya's sick. Have you heard? - What happened? - He has a fever. It must be a cold. Really? How are you feeling? Still just as bad? I'm better now. It's just that I get these thoughts when I don't work. You're in a bad mood. No wonder. She hasn't come. We've been expecting her. You have to stay positive at all times. She might still come. What if? Then, he'll talk some gibberish about an and start making a sculpture of her. He's not good at talking. CANNED FRUITS Who's there? Come in. - Volodya! - Yuriko? - Yuriko, it's you! - Tanya told me. - How are you feeling? - I'm fine. Oh. It's so messy here. Have a seat. Volodya, I'll make something to eat. No need to. Don't bother. Here. And then, it's as if you get hit by lightning. You're spun round and dropped to the ground. You're slowly raising your head. It feels heavy. Little by little. It's so scarry. You can't understand where you are and who is around you. Everything is dark. Now walk towards me but don't look at me. Yuriko, hold on. Prince is standing here. He's also grief-stricken. You bump into him, see his face, get scared, and run away. Let's try again. Number two. You're lifting your heavy body. Look above everyone's heads. Who is it? It's as if you're blind. Put your head down. This is a scene of madness. Your head is drowning in darkness and mist. You're trying hard to remember. There was something light and beautiful. Think hard. Now walk. Don't look. Yes. Now stop. You're trying to remember. A wedding ring. A bride. The dress was so pretty. A bride. What else? You told fortunes. Glissade! Two, three! Let's try again. Look here, Yuriko. Hold these flowers tight against your chest. Like a baby. And then you tell fortunes. Your body refuses to obey. Your head aches. Your head is splitting apart And then - bang! You run around looking for help. You don't understand who is around you. You dash around like a caged animal. Back and forth . You beg everyone. This pan is fine. Just don't forget to use your arms more. So what are you going to do, brother? - About what? - About Volodya. He's become too close with Yuriko. - What's wrong with that? - You might lose her! Don't be silly. Maybe you really should turn into a bear and go to Moscow Cut it out. I'm not going to Moscow. Boss, can you send me to Moscow? To Moscow? I'd like to collect folk songs there. Here's my project. It's out of the question. Boss, please! It's been decided that you're going to America for training this year. But I'd like to go to Moscow. Hold on! Boss, I beg you. Send me to Moscow. You're a fool to refuse training abroad. This is your way to the top. I know. But I need to go to Moscow. Is it about Yuriko? Cut it out. You're drunk. If I turn down this training, you'll be the one to get it. What do you mean? Wait! Wait! It's for your own good. - Don't you get it? - No. You will now. I have to see Yuriko and talk to her, don't you understand? So you love her? Yes. I didn't understand it before, but now that she is away, I do. Alright, let me go. I'm sorry. You're strong. You too. It still hurts. Go ahead, turn into a bear and go to Moscow. Did I scare you? Yes, I'm here. When do you finish class? Alright, I'll be there. I got it. Of course. - Volodya? - I'm here. - Volodya? - It's me. Hello. Hello. My name is Tetsuya. Tetsuya. Volodya, it's probably for you. What is it? - Volodya? - Yes. - Volodya? - Yes. You're Tetsuya? Tetsuya from Tokyo? Hello! This is Kolya. Hold on a minute. Let's go to the workshop and drink some tea. Tea! You don't understand, do you? Volodya, I don't know anything except "judo" in Japanese. Oh, he understands "judo". Kolya, don't hurt him. Stop here. Stop! Thank you. Cut it out! I told you I'd turn into a bear and come to Moscow! - Are you here to see me? - No, I'm here on business. Tetsuya collects folk songs from around the world. Recently, he went to India. And now, he's come here to record Russian folk songs. He has such an interesting job. Do you really think that I'm crying my eyes out? I'm screaming like a madman Your betrayal has changed me I'm an atheist of love I have been and will always be Instead of tearing my hair out I'm sending yours back to you In order not seem guilty To my child I sent him in the mail All your vows of eternal love I'm really the one to blame... What do you think? About what exactly? About Volodya. Did you like him? He seems like a nice guy. I'm glad you liked him. Do you like him? What do you mean? We strolled around... - How are you? - All is well. Why are you laughing? I imagined you holding a blonde baby... and cooking borsch. You're being weird. What should I do? Get on my knees and beg you to go back to Japan with me? It's probably too late for that. What do you mean? Looks like I've come to Moscow only to be rejected. I didn't expect that. I didn't know that you... Fine. You didn't know and I didn't say. But I... You love Volodya. I can see that. I'm leaving for Samarkand early in the morning. Bye. Why are you so sad? Do you miss Japan? Can I ask you something? Why didn't you get married? Why do you ask? You loved my mother, didn't you? - There's no point in discussing it now. - It's not fair. Tell me. To be frank, I did love her. Your mother was very beautiful. Like you are now. Did you try to forget her? I did. But your mother... after getting sick in Hiroshima... It might sound odd, but... She became a person impossible to forget. This is what love is. But don't get me wrong. I'm not a saint. I loved many women, but avoided marriage. Forgive me, Yuriko. My words hurt you. I know that. I'm sorry. And don't worry about me. Music cures. When you're busy, you get the desire to live. I wish you luck. And may you be happy. UP! Higher! Higher! Yuriko, why haven't you been calling Volodya? He's very worried . I haven't been able to. I couldn't raise my arm, I felt weak. Tetsuya and I are old friends. But last time, he told me he loved me. I felt so sorry for him. I felt apathetic. I wanted to die. You need to pull yourself together. It's alright. I'm fine now. Hello? - Volodya? - Yuriko! - Where have you been? - Volodya! Why haven't you called? - We're leaving. - Where? We're going south. To work. It's such a shame. I'm going on stage now. Who is going to dance Giselle is to be decided now. When will I see you? - You will. - When? You will. - What did you say? - I send you a kiss. For luck. You're not a serious person, Volodya. Yuriko, it's time! - Yuriko, come on! - I have to go. - Will you call me again? - I will. Yuriko! I wish you happiness! Call me. Yes, Volodya, I will. And now! have to go. Tanya does it better. But with her, we need to rehearse more. We still have time. - Let's do the next bit? - Of course. Enough! Let's do the basket dance. Tanya does this better too. But it can be fixed. Enough! Girls, are you tired? Look more joyful. And pay attention which foot is sur cou-de-pied. Don't shine in the dancer's eyes. You're blinding her. Why doesn't he let me dance? Let's do the madness scene. Very good. This one is inmost ready. Congratulations, Yuriko. Stop! Sasha, what are you doing? Giselle is dying, and you're smiling. She has a talent. You don't need to tell me that. She has done so much in such a shod term. She's going to become a great ballerina. Let her career begin in the Bolshoi Theater. I'm all for it. He doesn't let me dance. Why won't he let me dance? Yuriko, tomorrow you have a rehearsal. - No! - And the day after tomorrow too. And then, you have a general rehearsal. Congratulations. Congratulations, Yuriko! Well done! You did great! Congratulations! I'm so happy for you. - You did well. - But he criticized me! It's always like that with him. He praised me, but you got the part. I'm so happy for you. Congratulations. Don't worry. Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations, Yuriko! Congratulations! Congratulations! Congratulations! Yuriko! We're waiting for you! - Hello. - Hello! - Sir, visiting time is over. - Okay, I'm leaving. - How are you feeling? - Great. - But they don't discharge me. - They will. Sir, please! - Yuriko... - Everything will be alright. I feel great! I do! - Hello, doctor. - Hello. I'm sorry for being late. I had a rehearsal. I'm here to talk to you about Yuriko. How is she? I'd like you to discharge her. We need her. Actually, I just saw her. She says she feels good. I was glad to hear that. Next time you're late, call me. We'll organize a proper visit for you. - Does that mean you won't discharge her? - We will. Great. I'd like to explain my concerns. She's a young ballerina, and a premiere in the Bolshoi Theater... She's not going to dance. She can't. Doctor, artists treat their ailments on stage. She is sick. She is sick. And this is what I want you to do. Tell her that she's not going to dance at the premiere... but in such a way, that she doesn't know she's sick. Any nervous tension is harmful for her now. How am I going to tell her about that? Yuriko, how are you feeling? Good. But I'm a bit tired. I've caused everyone so much trouble. Don't say that. You just worry too much. It happens. But when you get well, you'll dance Giselle and become famous overnight. Volodya will be so happy when he finds out. - Hello! - Hello. You've lost weight. - Tanya! - Yuriko! Yuriko! Come try the dress on. You look so elegant. - You didn't lose your time. - Thanks. - Go see Nechayev in his office after this. - Alright. Good. When our girls get in hospital, they usually put on weight. How are you feeling, Yuriko? Very good, thank you. Sit down, please. Yuriko... Here's why I wanted to talk to you... As you know, we're going to have a premiere soon. Yes. That's why... we've had some concerns... Or, rather, hesitations... concerning the performers... which is natural. Irina Nikolayevna can also... Nobody says you dance badly, Yuriko... That's certainly not true. A lot of work has been done... - What is it all about? - Don't take it too personally. You're a wonderful dancer. - You're the kind of Giselle that... - Seryozha! Sergei Alekseyevich! - Irina Nikolayevna! - He's just nervous before the premiere. Everything will be alright. Let's talk about it tomorrow. Uncle! Uncle! “Dangers of Hereditary Diseases“ "Consequences of the Atomic Bomb - Wounds Do Not Heal" Children, quiet! My head is killing me! The atomic bomb? Yuriko? But it was Yuriko's mother who was a victim, not herself. But that's the terrible thing about the atomic bomb. Of course, it's consequences weren't felt by all children. There are many more of those who grew up healthy. But if Yuriko is sick, it's terrible. That means Yuriko might... Finished work? - Is everything alright? - Couldn't be better. Please, take me back to Japan. Why? I can't dance anymore. What are you going to do in Japan? If I have to die... I want to die in Japan. Don't be silly! Uncle Nagawa told you about my sickness, didn't he? - I'll never get well. - You will. They will help you. Don't console me. - I'm a vampire, I'll drink your bad blood! - Stop it. But Yuriko... What about Volodya? You want to go to Japan without seeing him? You love him, after all. What if I do see him? You have to see him. Tell me please, where is the theater that's being built? It's that way. Thank you. From here, you walk without me. Bye. Volodya! Volodya! What? Yuriko, it's you! Yuriko! Yuriko! I'm so glad to see you. How did you do it? - Do what? - Find this place. I just did. You're great. I woke up today and somehow I knew that you'd come. The sun was shining so brightly. Our Volodya is a psychic. Guys! Guys! By the way, Yuriko, Volodya wanted to ask you about your rehearsal. Oh yes! How was the rehearsal and when is the premiere? I think we should be invited. Nikolai can't wait. He's going to take me and go to Moscow Right, Kolya? Kolya, you'd better stay home! Thank you. The rehearsal went well. So Tanya and I decided to rest before the premiere. Let's drink to the city where every day is a celebration. Where even rain is a disappointment. The sky, the bread, the work. This is what life is. Life... Yuriko, you're so pretty. People like you should live in this city. What's great about my profession is dealing with the landscape. This sculpture unites everything. It creates a new world. And a lot of joy. Over here, we put a lot of fish. There'll also be a bright labyrinth. Right now, fish are too large for them. But that's going to change overtime. Children'll grow up, fish'll become small. But this will remain the scenery of their childhood. Our workshop is right on the beach. It's great to work here at dawn. The sea is so calm. When are you going back to Moscow? No. From here, we're going to a sandy island. Only fishermen live there. There's nothing but sand there, not even trees. It's completely flat. Nothing attracts the eye. Children grow without imagining there. We're going to install a ruby-colored compound. This place is full of colors and joy. And that place is deserted. There, sculpture creates the landscape. I'm a bit like god there. It's so nice here. Like it's the last time. Yuriko! I can't take it anymore. What's wrong? What do you mean? You're looking at me... like you want to say goodbye. No. Not at all. I'm very happy- Everything's alright. Everything's alright. See you tomorrow. Yes. Run faster! Yuriko! Yuriko! What's wrong? Yuriko, wait! Did you see Volodya? Enough about it. Enough! Did you tell Volodya? What for? To make him suffer? I'm hopelessly sick. It'd be better for me to disappear. Don't say that. Volodya was glad to see you. Loving means sharing suffering. Think about life, Yuriko. Love without thinking about death. Volodya, Yuriko has leukemia. She loves you. Help her. Yuriko! Yuriko, are you here? Yuriko! Yuriko! Yuriko! Are you alright? Answer me! Why did you do it? Why did you do it? I was swimming and almost drowned. - Yuriko, are you alright? - Yes. - It's just cold. - Yuriko... Don't say anything. Yuriko, I love you. Why did I come here? It was torture. We don't have a future, don't you understand? - But I love you. - Why did I come here? Yuriko, I love you. I have to tell you something. Don't say anything... I'm going to die. - No, that's not true. - Don't say anything. - You're going to get well. - I'm sorry. I didn't want you to know and suffer because of this. But I had to come. I had to say goodbye. I had to tell you that I love you. Yuriko! - Yuriko! - Volodya! You're going to get well. I'm so glad I came. I'm so glad. I love you! I'm glad everything is like this today. Tomorrow, I'm going back. Where to? - Do you feel bad? - Not at all. I feel great. But I have to leave. I'll go with you. No. I can go alone. No way. I'll be by your side. - I'll go with you. - Then I won't go anywhere. You talked so wonderfully about the island and children. I know what sculpture means to you. Don't deny it. I danced a little while ago. I remember the feeling. Promise me that you'll go to the island. Mind you, I can't worry. I love you so much. I'll go with you. I'll go with you. No, you promised. I'll wait for you in Moscow. Yuriko! No. I've never wanted to live so much. Yesterday's blood test showed a rapid increase in the number of blast cells. That means a considerable deterioration compared to the previous condition. It's a rare case for us. Have you contacted the Japanese doctors? Yes. And we asked to send us information about similar cases as soon as possible. The Japanese have a lot of experience treating cases like this. They have been observed in Hiroshima for 30 years. The Japanese try to prevent negative consequences in children of victims of the atomic bomb. They study hereditary diseases in second-generation victims. We regularly conduct consultations with Hiroshima Atomic-bomb Survivors' Hospital. We have patients like this. Can't this patient be transported here? The thing is, she wants to undergo treatment in Moscow. Where exactly was Yuriko Ono's mother exposed to radiation? About 500 meters from ground zero. In this area. Do they have any new methods of treating this case in the USSR? No. The same as everywhere. Do they have any new methods of treating this case in Japan? No. The same as everywhere. But we do succeed in other cases. Let's discuss it. Do you feel better? I'm holding on, uncle. What is it? Yuriko, what's wrong? Nurse! You're going to feel better. You might get sick yourself, doctor. You haven't slept for three days. I'm ready to forgo sleep for a year to save her. Poor girl. He will come. Volodya! How are you feeling, Yuriko? It's you, doctor... You seem to be better. Can you turn the light on? It's easier to sleep in the dark. Try to sleep. I'll try, doctor. Yuriko, you have a visitor. Volodya! Yuriko! Hello. How are you feeling? I'm so glad you're here. I had a terrible night. But now everything's alright. Can you open the curtains? It's do dark. Oh yes, I forgot. Light is bad for me. Sit closer. You're going to get well. Everything will be alright. Yes, of course. You're going to save me. You're used to saving me. And everything will be like in a fairy-tale. It's a shame that you didn't see me dance this fairy-tale. Kiss me, Volodya. Like that time. You're crying. It's a shame I can't see it. Volodya is crying like a child. You're going to get well. I know it. Yes. And we're going to go see ballet together. Of course. Another fairy-tale? All Andersen's fairy-tales end so happily. "And they lived happily thereafter". "And they died the same day". Everything will be alright, Yuriko. Even/thing will be alright, Volodya. Yuriko died before the spring, which she loved so much. I think Yuriko was happy because she was loved by Volodya and you. Although you weren't the one she loved. We mustn't forget that Yuriko was born in Hiroshima. And it was the only reason she died so young.
