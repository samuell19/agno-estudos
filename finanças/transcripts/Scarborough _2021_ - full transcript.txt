My advice would be to take one thing at a time. Next year, Johnny will be in school, and if there is a problem, a teacher will flag it. I mean, right now we'll be looking at specialists, we'd be looking at appointments, we'd be looking at travelling across the city.

And she's going to receive all those prayers and all those memories that you're sharing. So can we close our eyes for a moment? Think of happy thoughts. Think of those memories that you shared with Laura while she was with us. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ELDER FAY: Ah, Miigwech. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [knock on door] WOMAN: Yes, I was afraid I'd missed you. MS. HINA: I'm sorry. Uh, we're just closing up for the day. JANE: Oh, it's me, Jane. MS. HINA: Jane, hi. Uh, I was just about to get out of here. JANE: Do you have a couple moments? I just got your email. MS. HINA: Right. So you got the email, so you know what happened? JANE: Yes, exactly. MS. HINA: Jane, this is not a great time right now. Just feeling pretty exhausted, you know? Just a long day of kids crying, you know, and... the adults crying. Just everybody's... JANE: I can only imagine. MS. HINA: I mean, you wouldn't have to imagine. JANE: Excuse me? MS. HINA: You wouldn't have to imagine, Jane, if you'd just been there today for the ceremony. JANE: The ceremony? MS. HINA: For Laura. It was in that email. JANE: Oh, well, I'm here about your request for time off on Monday. MS. HINA: For the funeral? JANE: Okay. I can tell by the way you're looking at me that you must think I'm a monster. I just wanted to quickly check in, make sure we're on the same page. MS. HINA: Thank you for checking in. I need to go and pick up my daughter from school now. JANE: Absolutely. Hina, I'm going to tell you something my manager told me when I was fresh out of my Master's. Now, it hurt then to hear, but I needed to hear it. Community members are always in need. And it can be hard to draw the line with them. But for the sake of your own self-care, you need to keep personal lives out of the picture. Now, our focus here is family literacy, not social work. Now, I know there are grey areas, and I appreciate the love that you put into the centre. But if we don't draw a line, our hearts can be hurt a million times over. Now, if you need some skills building or whatever to support you, we can chat any time. MS. HINA: Wow. Any time? JANE: Any time. Any time at all. So Monday instead, I'd like to propose some strategies for self-care. I'll be making... MS. HINA: You want to meet on Monday... instead of me going to the funeral, you want to strategize with me? This is what you came here to tell me? JANE: Hina, I know this has been a very, very sad time. MS. HINA: Yes, it's been a very difficult time. There's a child that died in a house fire, Jane. JANE: I-I know. MS. HINA: There are people in our community that have brushed shoulders with her family once, twice, that are showing more emotion than you are. I'm not sure what the disconnection is with you, but I am deeply saddened by this. This has been a tragic loss. JANE: Absolutely, yes. MS. HINA: And I have every right to feel this way, Jane. I certainly have every right to ask for a day off to attend her funeral. JANE: Oh, I know. I couldn't believe it either. When I saw it on the news, I was shocked. MS. HINA: Laura was more than just a news item to me, Jane. I wasn't shocked. I was hurt. We failed her. You do understand that, right? And you showing up here and asking me to feel nothing... you are continuing to fail her. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ SYLVIE: If we write our names in concrete, a hundred years from now, people will know who we are.

And he needs to be taught how help out and clean up. MS. HINA: Everything okay? FERN: Everything is fine. We're just trying to do a little parenting. MS. HINA: Fern, I don't think this is your place.

I'm trying to get him to... MARIE: His name is Johnny, and he's not like other kids. He can't help it. FERN: Maybe you could help it, if... Oh. [scoffs] [sarcastically] Who could've seen that coming? MS. HINA: Bye. See you later. Bye. Bye, see you later. Hey, how's it going? Coffee? MARIE: Sure. Thanks. MS. HINA: I was wondering if you wanted to maybe have a chat about Johnny now that it's a little quieter here? I think that obviously I just thought we could talk if you're open to it. MARIE: Okay. MS. HINA: How's your arm? MARIE: It's okay. It looks worse than it is. MS. HINA: Ah, yeah, tough mama. [chuckles] Marie, I've noticed that Johnny seems to be struggling to express himself sometimes. He's finding it challenging to... to tell us what he wants, and... I wish that I knew how to help him better. I-I just... Marie, I'm no expert. MARIE: I took him to the walk-in clinic and the guy didn't want to assess him. MS. HINA: Right. It's... It's so complicated. They don't do assessments at the walk-in. They should have told you. You actually... you need a family doctor to be able to get the assessment, and then the referral. MARIE: I don't have a family doctor. MS. HINA: Okay. Okay. So let's figure that out first. I have a friend of mine that works at East York General. I'm sure if I called her, she'd be open to seeing Johnny. MARIE: I don't even know when I'd have time to go there. I have to pick up the kids from school, and then I have to get them home and cook them dinner, and then put them in bed. And then I have to get... MS. HINA: Marie, I'll take you. I'd be happy to. Look, Marie, I can't imagine how challenging it must be to... ...take all of this on. MARIE: He's my son. MS. HINA: I know. And I see how much you love him. And so it's okay, Marie. You're doing a great job. And you don't need to have all of the answers right now. We can take the first step together. MARIE: [sighs] ♪ Okay. MS. HINA: Okay. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ MARIE: Ever since he was born, I just knew that there was something different about Johnny. I know that there's a way to communicate with him. Like, he has his own special language; I just don't know what it is. DOCTOR: How does he try and talk to you? JOHNNY: Boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing. MARIE: He doesn't pay attention to us. Like, he does his own thing. You just have to keep an eye on him. Like, you have to watch him constantly. Like, you can't take your eyes off him. You have to, like, lock cupboards. We have to make sure that everything's put away. If you leave something out, he'll find it. Johnny has taken markers and written all over everything. His worst case scenario, he has rubbed his poop all over the place, and then I have to clean it up, and... he runs all over the place when we're at the literacy centre. He'll go to one thing and then he'll play with it for a little bit, and then he'll go to something else. And then he always goes back to the light switch, and he turns it on and off and on and off. And then you take him away from there, and then he goes back. He'll keep going back to the same thing. And if you take him away from it, he gets super frustrated. See what I mean? JOHNNY: [humming] DOCTOR: What are you looking at, Johnny? You looking at the leaves out there? Yeah, there's lots, hey? DOCTOR: It does appear that Johnny is displaying autistic disorder. And he's operating at about a 12-month capacity. Okay? So this could mean that Johnny may never speak in full sentences. We can look at some services; we can improve his communication, but he will not communicate like his peers or like other children his age. That means that Johnny might always need supports in his life. So Johnny may never be independent with his toileting. He might always need personal care. He might never live independently. And he might always require somebody there for him. So it's something to think about, maybe long-term planning for yourself as you age, and who will look after Johnny. Okay? As you do get older, or when you do pass away, who will be there to look after him? MARIE: [sobbing] ♪ ♪ DOCTOR: My receptionist is going to provide you some resources at the front. I will warn you, they're not easy to get to. And they can be quite far apart from each other. And each specialist, we have a limited number of sessions you can have with each of them, okay? A lot of these services will be done in the home, but I understand your housing situation is a bit unstable at the moment. It's a lot to take in, hearing the word, "autism." But having a diagnosis is actually a good thing. ♪ WOMAN: Green, here. You have red and green. The red one fell. DOCTOR: What these specialists will do is they'll observe Johnny's behaviours and give him some skills, and teach him how to communicate better so that he's not engaging in some of the behaviours, such as screaming and biting. Once he can learn to communicate, those behaviours should reduce, okay? So these specialists are going to teach Johnny some skills, and you'll start to see some progress. JOHNNY: [humming] MS.
