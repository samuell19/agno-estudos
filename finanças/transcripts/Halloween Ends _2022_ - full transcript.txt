"W" who? WURG 94.9, the Urge, Haddonfield's home for rock. I'm Willie the Kid, and there's n-n-nothing you can do about it. Corey, you're a lifesaver. Hi. How've you been? Come on in. Roger! Corey's here! Sorry this is last-minute, but Andrea got a stomach bug - and literally just called me. - Oh, it's okay. It's Roger's company Halloween party, and I could care less, but... Roger! Hope he's better at childcare than he is at yard work. You know, next spring, you should consider some perennials. Hydrangeas could really - balance out that dogwood. - Saving for college? - Where did you say you're going? - Oh, I'm applying to a few different engineering programs. Just saving money this year so I can go next fall. Jeremy, the sitter's here! Jeremy! Jeremy! Ah! You! I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you. Crash landing! Kaboom! Oh! Beep, beep, beep, beep. Can you show me how to make a Thunder Bomber? Number one of all time. - My dad can do the best. - No pressure. Yeah, I'll sure give it a shot, little dude. You gonna be good for Mr. Corey? - Corey. Could I talk to you for a sec? - Yeah. Here comes the Thunder Bomber! I'm gonna put the candy on the porch. Trick-or-treat kids can help themselves. Help yourself to anything in the fridge. She made zucchini bread. It's actually good. You have my number. - Okay. - If there's an emergency, but we'll just be right down the street. Crash! And there is one thing I need to tell you. Since last Halloween... All the events and, you know, the headlines of Michael Myers... Jeremy's been afraid of the dark. He's been wetting the bed at night. And, um, bedtime has been difficult. I can hear you! Uh, I can read him a story or something. - Does he have a favorite book? - Then once he goes to bed, he talks in his sleep. Says he hears voices. He's just really sensitive to things - that give him bad dreams. - Right. All that just sounds like normal kid imagination stuff, right? No TV and no more candy. You guys can play till 8:30, 8:45. Then he should go to bed. - Easy money. - Yes. Gonna come play with me or what? That sounds like a threat. It's Halloween. We're gonna have a good time tonight. Oh. - Ugh. - Look, man, we can shut it off if you're scared of monster movies. No. No. You're scared. I'm 21 years old. I don't get scared. You're scared because you know Michael Myers is... still out there. Boogeyman's gonna get you. He's not gonna get me. Michael Myers kills babysitters, not kids. Okay, that's actually pretty disgusting and probably not appropriate for kids. Why don't we shut this off, and... we can play hide-and-seek before bed. Your parents are gonna be home soon and... I don't want to play no hide-and-seek. It's stupid. I want to watch this movie. And I don't really feel like pretending to be best friends with an ugly-ass boy babysitter. Okay, five minutes, and then you're going to bed. You suck at babysitting. I'm not a babysitter. Jeremy! Turn that movie off! Jeremy? What are you doing? Jeremy? Jeremy! Jeremy? Come out, come out, wherever you are. Boo! This isn't funny, Jeremy. Jeremy! Jeremy? Help! Corey, help! Jeremy? Jeremy? Jeremy? He's gonna get you! He's gonna get you when you least expect it. - Is it your bedtime, Corey? - Okay, Jeremy... "Come out, come out, wherever you are." You got me, buddy. Okay, let me out. - Are you scared? - Okay? "I'm 21. I'm not scared." Jeremy, let me out. Let me out! You little shit! Let me out of here! Michael Myers. Jeremy, it's not funny, okay? Hey, you're gonna get us both in trouble. Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! You little shit! I'm gonna kill you, Jeremy! Boo! What was that? Jeremy! - Oh, no! Oh, God, no! Please! - Jeremy! - Oh, no. Oh, God. - Jeremy! Oh, my God! Jeremy! - Jeremy. - Jeremy! God, please, no! What have you done?! Haddonfield was a peaceful town. And then one Halloween night many years ago, all of that was lost. Michael Myers was pure evil. He took our dreams and turned them into nightmares. As he was locked away in his prison... ...I disappeared into mine. And then, as I predicted, 40 years later, he escaped, and Haddonfield was once again forced to confront this man in a mask. His senseless brutality ravaged my community... ...and killed my daughter. And then he vanished. Impossible? Perhaps. Truth would evolve into legend as people searched for motive and meaning, looking in the shadows for their boogeyman. It was an accident. In the years that followed, the people of Haddonfield descended into a plague of grief, of blame, of paranoia. Do you think he's come back? Michael doesn't use guns. The suffering Michael caused became an infection passing on to people who never even crossed his path. And as the town turned in on itself, I made a promise not to let fear rule my life anymore. I bought a home. A place to live with love and trust. Not a trap. Not a place to hide. Hey. It has been four years since I last saw my monster. So here I am, a survivor attempting to share my story and find healing. Michael Myers was the personification of evil. It's theirs. It's their wedding rings. It's up to each of us whether or not we lock the door and find our resolve... ...or let him inside. Let it inside. Let evil... inside. Allyson! Darn it! - Honey, I'm so sorry! - What is it? Oh, fuck! Um, it's my pie. I put a pie in the oven. Oh, shit! Oh, I must have forgotten to set the timer. Damn it! Darn it! No, no, no, no, Oh, no. I can get a pie from the store. No! I wanted to bake you a pumpkin pie. It's a Halloween tradition. - Are you... - I got to go. - I'm late for work. - Okay. But do you have your costume for the party? I told you, I don't want to go alone. So I'm not going. Oh. Giving you the Urge, with Willie the Kid. Haddonfield's home for rock. It is four days until Halloween. Can you believe it? It's time to lock your doors, grab your knife for the fight. You ready? You ready in case the Boogeyman decides to come out and play? I know I am. But let's talk about that Michael Myers for a minute. How does one man get shot at, stabbed up and then he fall down the street and get back up to scare the piss out of everybody in Haddonfield? Let me tell you how... 'cause this isn't a man. This is more than a man. This is a beast. One that doesn't bleed... I'm pretty sure that was in the change order. Hold-hold on a second, Shannon. Hey, Corey, you're late! You're late again! It's been four years. Where y'all at? Training for the big day, perhaps? Getting yourself in the spirit? This Boogeyman been sitting in hibernation, but trust me, y'all, he'll be back. I'm Willie the Kid, and I'll be creeping it real on 94.9 WUR... Corey, you got a second? What do you think? Yeah. Get it registered. Get some new plates. - I got no use for it no more. - Are you serious? With a good engine pushing you, finally make it to work on time, you know what I mean? Does it work? Yeah, it works, just kind of shitty. Hey, uh, Ronald? Thanks. No problem, kid. You're under arrest. For being the prettiest girl I know. That's nice, Doug. Is that why you pulled me over? No. I pulled you over 'cause I miss you. You miss me? Just kidding. Pulled you over 'cause it looks like your muffler's about to fall off. Better get that fixed before you have a bigger problem on your hands. You gonna buy something or what? I could've drove here. Chill. I'm the designated driver. - I know how to drive. - Don't mess up my car, please. - I'm not gonna mess up your car. - All right? - Don't mess it up. - Chill. - His dad is... - I got my license. It's no hating on. Come on. - Billy. I.D.? - So what's the plan? - Give me the I.D. -I.D.? - Yeah. - It got confiscated last week. - I told you. - She's got the money. - You don't have your I.D.? - Wait. You what? - Wait. Hold on. Hey, yo! - I lost it. Wait. New friend. What, drinking a little milk. - Yeah. Yeah. - I like milk, too. Look, here's the deal, man. We're seniors, okay? We've been practicing for our show the whole year, you know. Loading up for, uh, tonight's game and... Well, we're in the fucking marching band. We were just hoping you could be a cool new friend, you know. Just buy us a couple of six-packs. Just-just for me and my crew. Come on, man. Uh, no. No? No-no, thank you? What? - No, I can't. - Oh, wait. - I know who you are. - You did something messy. - I can't believe they let you off. - Well, who is he? - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. You're that psycho babysitter. He killed that kid, didn't he? - Yep. - Killed a kid and too pussy - to buy us some fucking beer? - Guys, you know what? Let's just fucking forget about it. Let's just go to the game, okay? - You're just a little pedo. - Look at him. - Let him know, Terry. - That what you are? A little fucking pedo creep? - That's right. - Get in his face, Terry. What kind of fucked-up kid are you? - That's right. -Right. - So where's your next victim? - Whoa! - What the fuck?! Are you kidding me, man? Oh, shit. - Look at you. - What the fuck, Terry? Got fucking milk everywhere. - Holy shit. - Look what you did. Hey! Assholes! Knock it off! - We're not doing anything. - We're just talking, miss. - We're messing around. - Ma'am. Hey, guys. Would you look at this? I mean, a psycho meets a freak show. - Wow. - Can't believe it. This is a match made in heaven. - Hey, come on. Look at me. - Ta-ta for now. Let's go, y'all. Michael Myers. Are you the psycho or the freak show? Hey, Margo, do you want to go to the school play on Saturday? - Yeah, sure, Terry. - Have fun. So, do you want to do it, or you want me to? Look at it. Are you kidding? It looks great on you. I'm sure it does, but I'm not going. Once you put the whole outfit on, you'll love it. I say if it's not sexy, it's not Halloween. Well, someone's getting into the spirit of things. This gentleman had an accident and needs a little fix-up. You have significant inflammation. Um, I'm gonna be nice and numb it here so my assistant can clean it up really well, and then I will get back and close it with a suture. You're gonna feel a little bit of a pinch here. Cute, isn't she? I don't... Ow! - Jesus Christ! - Sorry. Sorry. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Allyson, what are you doing? - It's my fault. Sorry. - Allyson! - No. - Sorry, sorry. No. No, my fault. It was my fault. - I-I'm so sorry. Oh, geez. - What a mess. Just clean it up and get a goddamn sterile kit. And give him a tetanus shot. I'll be back. You shouldn't let that guy talk to you like that. It's gonna make you sad, even if you don't think it does. I've dealt with much worse. But thank you. Anyway, I've just been dealing with it. Well, I'm supposed to get this promotion. - But either way, it's just... - Is it worth it? What'd you do? - Uh... - To your hand? Uh, I was at work, and then I had a little accident. - So your job sucks, too. - Hmm? Where do you work? What do you do? - Oh, a mechanic shop. - Don't move. Don't want to get infected. So my car's been rattling. - Rattling? - Yeah. Uh, it's just your exhaust system clamp's come loose. It's an easy fix. It takes like five minutes. Super cinchy. You just need a lift and two screws. "Cinchy"? You don't have to fix it right now. Yeah, I don't have my stuff, but... I am at the shop tomorrow. I can fix it then. Why can't the bicycle stand on its own? No, no. It can. It's got a kickstand. 'Cause it was too tired. Yeah. Oh, I'm actually getting rid of the bike, so if you want it, you can have it. I got a motorcycle. - Oh, a motorcycle? - Yeah. Teach me to ride it? Yeah. You have shit on your back. I'll get it. We should go out sometime and do something. - With me? - With both of us. I mean, we'd both have to be there. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a very good time. Yeah, you don't want to do that. Uh, I'm gonna be late for dinner. But, uh, I appreciate the hand. It feels better already. So you did that on purpose. What? He was injured, he needed medical attention, and Dr. Mathis - is the best in town. - Do you believe her? Do not believe a word she says. - You know, she's a strategist. - Fine, fine, fine. She's just trying to play Cupid. Thought he was cute. Seemed nice. Are you gonna call him and invite him to her party, or you gonna just go alone? Now pick a card. Mm-hmm. Oh, no. I got the death card. - No, that's not bad in tarot. - Mm-mm. No, that just means a major phase is ending and a new one is about to begin. So, that pretty much puts a nail in the coffin with that police officer you were dating. Ugh, Doug. You know, you need to find someone that can let go. That makes you want to rip off your shirt and show grief your fucking tits and say, "You know what? Let's go." This is delicious. Corey. Is it infected? Is your hand infected? What did the doctor say? He said it's gonna be fine, Mama. He said that you don't need to worry, and he said it would be terrific is what he said. Well, I just might have to send him back to the call center to work for Devon if you can't give him proper supervision. I can't keep my eyes on every second. What the hell are you doing? Who's that calling you under the dinner table? Uh, it's no one, Mama. Who's that person you're texting? It's no one. Boys who keep secrets don't get custard for dessert. Don't tell her about the motorcycle, then. Ford station wagon. Hold on one second. Something I can help you with? Corey said I should bring it in. Get on. Okay, so... Okay. Uh, right hand, gas. Left hand is your front... Fuck. Uh, sorry. Right hand is gas, also your front brake. And then left hand is your, uh, clutch. Right foot is your back brake. And, uh, left foot is the shifter thingy. Simple. Doesn't sound simple. Yo, Corey! Come give us a hand. - Hey, Ron. - Hey, Terry. I'm sorry to bother you with this shit. My goddamn son drove three miles on a fucking flat 'cause he doesn't know how to change a tire on a goddamn automobile. Fucking genius. Uh... I got it. Yeah, and fucking smarten up. I'm gonna go help Ronald and then fix the rattle. Your rattle. Your car's, uh... I don't care about the rattle. I came to see you. We'll take care of her. Just got to be a little smarter, kid. Three pounds of ground chuck, right here on the top. - Thank you. - Be right back with the lean. Jesus, Frank, have you ever heard of a vegetable? Well, look who it is. - They're good for you. - Well, I like to mix meats and make croquettes for the guys at the station. Okay, that just sounds disgusting. I like your hair. Thanks. Thanks. I, uh... I just sort of chopped it one day. It just was... It felt like time. Wow. Somebody else fixed it. - Help. - Yeah. There goes your lean. - Ah. Thank you, Travis. - Have a good day. - Okay. - See ya. But I tell you, I-I feel like I won an extra life. - Mm. - I really do. I got myself a guitar at the pawnshop, and I've been fiddling around with that, and my niece gave me a Rosetta Stone, - and now I'm learning Japanese. - Mm. - What does that mean? - It means I lost my shirt. I think. Or I lost my hat. I don't know. I... Uh... Thanks. Uh, who knows? Maybe I'll fly over for the cherry blossoms. Test it out on the locals. You still got your nose in that, uh, book you're writing? Your fault. It was your idea. It was? - No, I'm... - Got a title? Just set up my office. You know, I have a house with Allyson. We're living together. It's nice. Uh... You know, she's been talking to this guy. You probably know him. Corey Cunningham. Oh, yeah. I do know. He's a good kid. Had a tough break. It's nice to know somebody's out there looking out for him. I like your face. I mean, I like seeing your face. So do you. I mean... I do, too. I like seeing you, too. Hi. Hey. What you smiling about? What did you buy at the store? - I'm sorry? - "I'm sorry?" I'm s... I'm sorry. I don't understand. Do you see what he did to my sister? He killed her husband, and he stabbed her. Took her voice! She cannot speak because of you! You were her neighbor, and you don't even know her name, do you? You tempted and you provoked that man when you should've left him alone. Laurie. Hey. You okay? Yeah. I would like to see those cherry blossoms. And I think you'd like 'em, too. Whoo! Who knows what to believe? I think the man who escaped Smith's Grove in 1978 was not the same man who killed all those people. The real Michael Myers was murdered that night, and the heavy breather with the mask was the same man who poisoned Pope John Paul I. - There you are! - Hi. I thought I missed you. Who's under the mask? Uh... I'm a scarecrow. What? I said I'm a scarecrow. Are you supposed to be scary? I'll be right there. I'll be right back, okay? I'm gonna get us a drink. Watch it! Hey, scarecrow. See anything you like? Hey, Lindsay. - Two vodka sodas. - Two vodka sodas. Lindsay, guess who Allyson's scarecrow is. The guy that fucked the old lady at the nursing home. Deb, drop it. I'm kidding. It's actually Corey Cunningham, the guy that killed that kid. Don't listen to her, Allyson. You can be with whoever you want to be with. Yeah. And right now, I'm with him. Yeah! Hey, man. Can I get a beer? Hey. You're just here dancing and having a good time? I'm sorry. You're sorry? Oh. Sorry? Sorry for killing my son? I wake up every day, and I can't get past the pain. It kills me. Do you understand? You think you can come here... No, you don't understand if you think you can come here and take off your little mask and have a good time with your friends. A judge might have said you're innocent, but I know you. I know it was no accident. It was no accident! You pushed my little boy because you got mad, and you lost your fucking mind! Innocent people don't do that! No! Evil people do. Evil. Corey! Corey, watch out! Corey! Corey! - Stop. Talk to me. - Why'd you take me in there? It's why I don't go out. - What? - You just, you... you threw me in the middle of it, and then you... Where were you? I didn't know what was happening in there. I-I was just trying, I was just trying to help you to just... I'm not your fucking project, Allyson! I just... Corey, I know! Okay? I know what it's like to have everybody looking at you, thinking that they know you, thinking that they know what you've been through, but they don't. But when I look at you... When I saw you the other day, I just saw a person. Just a person just trying to figure it the fuck out. Trying to wake up every day not scared and alone. But the difference, Allyson, between me and you is that people look at me like, "Who is this guy? Who is this monster?" And they look at you like... They see you like a survivor. What are you talking about? I get it. You survived Michael Myers. You're a hero with your struggles, and ask anyone. I'm the psycho babysitter. I'm the fucking kid killer. And you think you can fix me, but you can't. I'll spare you the heartache. Corey! Hey, cool kid. What's up? Where you going? There you are, man. I've been looking for you. - Terry. - I want to apologize, okay? Ugh, Jesus Christ. So what do you say, Corey? Huh? How about this? Handshakes and friendship. Don't leave him hanging, dude. What is your problem with this kid? - This guy fucked up the LeBaron. - Hell yeah. Dollar store designer frames? Oops. Hey, let me help you up. Come on. - Sorry. - Are you okay? - Whoa. Whoa. - Get the fuck back! - Hey! Hey! - Get back! - Get back! - Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. - I'm just trying to help. - Get back! You gonna murder us? Same way you killed that kid? You little psycho bitch. You don't know what you're talking about! You don't know what you're talking about. You just act like a goddamn asshole because your father treats you like one. It's contagious, right? Shit. - What did you just say to me? - That's right. I know what it looks like when somebody hates you. And your father fucking hates you. Hmm? He hates me? - Billy. - He hates me, huh? - He hates me, right? - Hey! Billy, knock it off. Billy! He hates me? Terry, what the fuck?! Oh, shit! - Oh, shit. - Oh, my God. - Oh, shit. - Terry, what did you do?! - He fell. - Little dick busted it. - Is he dead? - Go down and look. - No, you go down and look. - What the fuck? I didn't push nobody. He fell. - Bullshit. - He fell? Yeah, that's my story. Let's get out of here. Who's the psycho now, Terry? Who's the psycho? Little prick deserved it. Get in the car, Margo. We killed a kid, man. Come on. Hey, what's happening? Just... I can't get this fucking thing to turn on. Okay, okay. Take a breath. - Okay, take a deep breath. - Just let me be mad! Why can't I be mad?! You can. You can be mad. You can be very, very mad, And you can smash things. Just be careful. It's addictive. You were right. I liked him. Yeah. You see that man in there? He take people in there now and then. Why'd he let you live? I say you go back. You go back in there, and you get me that mask. I'm Michael Myers. The fuck? He not done with you, you little fuck. Hey! Where have you been? I have been worried sick! Corey, I almost called the missing persons. What is going on with you? Corey, I'm talking to you. She's no good, damn it. Open the door. Open the door! Are you trying to kill me? Corey? Corey? No hard feelings about the promotion, right? Course not. You deserve it. I thought for sure Dr. Mathis was gonna make you the charge nurse. Deb, can I speak to you a minute? Okay, Deb, I'm gonna tell you once... People create their own stories and make their own choices. They believe what they want to believe. I'm hopeful, with perspective, that my experience will help others heal. You have to ask yourself, "Am I in control, "or do the elements control me? "Life or death. Suicide or cherry blossoms." Hi. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. I'm just waiting for Allyson. Corey? Everything okay? Uh, I got jumped on the way home last night. These guys... Those kids from the gas station that were messing with me... I tried to stand up for myself, and they, um... Oh, I'm sorry. I just came 'cause I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to say that I'm sorry and there's... no excuse. But if you could, please, if you could just take a walk with me. Please? I killed someone. We were making paper planes, but he wanted to watch a monster movie. Everything happened so fast. I just wanted it to be a fun night. That's all, just... a good night. And then it all went bad. I heard what happened. I know it sounds crazy, but when... people would talk about it, it was like I knew you. Like I was looking for you. And then she brought you to me. Has he done something bad? I don't understand why you're here. No, no. He's seeing my granddaughter. I introduced them, actually. Your granddaughter should be so lucky as to be with a boy like Corey. He's handsome. He's sensitive. I don't like it when he stays out all night with girls, but he's grown. He can do what he wants. Yes. I know he's had his difficulties. My son. This town turned against him after the accident with Jeremy Allen. They would've felt for him. They would've helped him heal. But because your boogeyman disappeared, they needed a new one. I'm sorry. After my mom and dad were killed, I just wanted to burn it all to the ground - and get away from Haddonfield. - Why not leave? Why stay? All my memories are here. I think both your parents got killed and your grandma feels guilty about it, so she's making you her child. If you could've seen her before therapy, sobering up, and me... I'm just terrified to think what would happen if she were all alone if I left. So, what, you got to stay here, protect her from herself forever? Look... I'm sorry I lost my head at the party and I walked away. That was a mistake. When I look at you, I... I know I can tell you the truth. I'm not afraid of these people. I'm not afraid anymore. You tell me that you want to burn it down, or you tell me you want to burn it to the ground. Hey. Twice in one week. Pretty cool. Hot diggity. Hey, you said you, uh... you were gonna call. You were... you were gonna call, but you didn't call. No, I owe you a call. Did I... did I do something wrong or... I'm with someone. Oh. Oh. Oops. Uh, sorry for that. I'm sorry for the intrusion. Well, um, you know, it's, uh... it's Joe Grillo's, uh... Hey, Joe! Hey. Joe Grillo's birthday today. And Joe Ross, uh, he made a sponge cake. You two want to stop by, get a slice - after whatever you guys are doing? - We're good. Oh. Okay, you're good. Let me tell you, it's, uh... If you change your mind, there's... She said we're good! Hey, buddy, you got a problem? We're good. Oh, shit. Allyson. So you call Mr. Aggravated Manslaughter at night when you can't sleep? Hmm? When you see the Boogeyman in your nightmares? You feel safe with this guy? Hey, man. Messing around. Allyson. Nah, nah, nah. - Psycho. - You good, Mulaney? It's all good. It's all good. We need to go kick somebody's ass? No, no. I got this. Just burn it all to the ground. I'll light the match. Do you want to come in? Another night. Ah, fuck! Hey! You don't fuck with Doug Mulaney! Where are you? Huh? You say it was an accident. But I know what you did. I'm gonna fuck your face up, you little shit. The fuck is that? Help. Show me how to do it. Get up, get up, get up. Get up! Who is it? It's me. Oh, my God. Are you okay? I don't know what's happening to me. What's going on? Look at me. Who did this to you? Hey. Look at me. Did Michael Myers let you live? Or did you escape? Does it hurt? No. No. My mother saved me. You're fucking him, aren't you? It's, like, the perfect story of Haddonfield in a way. Cute young girl falls for local creep. Imagine if your grandmother had fallen in love with Michael Myers. But she didn't. I heard she stabbed him in the neck with a fucking knitting needle. What's your problem, Deb? You talk to me like I'm not even here. Do you ever just shut your goddamn mouth? I know, right? I know I talk too much. I just get so excited about all that Boogeyman bullshit. Uh-uh. No. I-I'm vetoing that trade. Your second receiver for Mark's last-place defense reeks of collusion. It's not a straight-up swap. You want to win the championship with class? Stop cheating. Stop cheating. I keep seeing his eyes. Are we talking about Michael or this kid? Michael's eyes in Corey. Lindsay, I was so sure. Just like the first time. Hey, Roger. There's someone I want you to meet. I always liked Corey. You know, some kids, you can tell they're a pain in the ass, but Corey was a good kid. And I just couldn't imagine he'd be capable of hurting anyone on purpose. But with the trial, I... just started spinning with theories, and... and eventually I thought, "Give it up. You're never gonna get closure. There's no such thing." A couple of years go by, and I'd see him every now and then, see the way people avoided him or how they made faces behind his back, which, if I'm honest, pissed me off. Because I felt like they took my pain... ...my despair, and they made it about them. And then, yesterday, I'm on my way to work. There he is. And I think, "I'm gonna say something, "prove my wife wrong. Let's find a way to forgive this kid." And I pull up next to him, and he looks at me, and it's not him. At least not in the eyes. And I don't know, man. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Right then, I felt like I got my answer. The kid who used to mow our lawn didn't kill my son. I know that. But the guy I saw on the side of the road was down a dark path. Did the town do this to him after the accident? Or was it always there? You're just laughing at all my jokes, aren't you? Oh, my God. All right, Alexa. Play "Tell Me With Your Eyes" by Rob Galbraith. Here's "Tell Me With Your Eyes..." This house is so... rich. Baby, I have been waiting all day for this. I've been saving this bottle of Au Bon Climat. You looked so fucking hot at the office today. Hmm. Mind if I... Bedroom's down the hall. Clean up. Take a shower. In fact, I'll meet you in there. Yes, yes. Mm-hmm. Yes. Holy shit. Is there a doctor in the house? Yeah, baby. All right. Got the cheese. We got the crackers. We're ready. Dr. Mathis? Dr. Mathis? Dr. Mathis? Dr. Mathis? Please, please, please, please. Please, please, please, please. 911... After the accident, I'd ride my bike over here and I'd sit up on this roof. And I'd look up at that tower. Wonder if I could climb to the top. It was summoning me. Like a watchtower or beacon calling me to live my old life. To be happy again. I have something like that, too. It always gave me hope, you know, things would... Well, maybe somehow things would go back to the way they used to be. Before everything changed. Infected. I got to get away from everybody who knows me. But I don't, I... I don't want to go alone. Corey, come on. Stop. I think you're scared that you don't have enough bandages to keep me together. Corey, what are you...?! Are you okay? What, are you insane? What, are you trying to kill yourself? I'm not interested in immortality. The hell is going on out here? Yo, this is private property. Not safe to be doing whatever the hell you do... Corey Cunningham. What you doing out here, you ugly motherfucker? - Corey, stop it. - You gonna scare all the kids. You stop. I don't know who the fuck you talking to, but, uh, I know who you are. Yeah, I know the Laurie Strode story. She teased a man with brain damage, and then he snapped. Look at you. You gonna make a little name for yourself now, huh? Walking around with this dumb bitch right here. You never shut up. Hear his voice everywhere. Oh, you're goddamn right you do. And once Willie get in your ear, it's like your favorite song stuck in your head. Y'all get the hell up off my property before I fuck y'all up. All right. You're right. Let's do it. I don't want to be in Haddonfield anymore. I want to be with you. I can smell her on you. She's trying to take you away from me, isn't she? That's where you go every night. Well, I say go. You go right now! Get out of my house! Oh, no. No. I hope you find love. Allyson? It's nice to see you. You know, there are two kinds of evil. There's the evil that exists as an external force that threatens the well-being of the tribe. Survival depends on understanding and awareness and fear of physical threat to our daily lives. The other kind of evil lives inside us. Like a sickness or an infection. It's more dangerous because we may not know we're infected. Am I a bad person? Are you? Well... ...we're both fucked-up. I want to help you, Corey. Let me help you. Or let me find help for you. You can't have her. Allyson is not equipped for this relationship, and I will not let her get hurt. So stay the fuck away... You started this! You brought me in! You invited me! But you're the one to blame. "You want to do it, or you want me to?" If I can't have her... ...no one will. You want to help Allyson? Let her live her life. She has me now. You should give in. You should surrender to that feeling you had the first time you ever looked into his eyes. You secretly hope Michael comes back for you. I'm the psycho. You're the freak show. What's wrong? We need to leave. I can't right now. I'm working. Tonight, then. Will you meet me at 9:00? At the diner off 74. We need to talk about your grandmother. She wants to kill me. - What? - Yeah. I can't take it anymore. It's time to say goodbye to Haddonfield. You got something I need. You're just a man in a Halloween mask. What are you gonna do now? Call him after. I don't want to go to your house, man. Your dad always fucking yells at us. Too fucking bad. You should've got your own. Shouldn't have any of these anyway. Why can't we go to her house? She's the one that's rich. - Oh, what? Yeah. Shoot. - What the fuck? What? He's dead! Get in! Oh, shit. Shit. Did you find what you're looking for? I imagine you're going on a wonderful trip. - Were you gonna tell me? - What difference does it make? It makes a big difference, Allyson. I feel he is capable of real harm. Is that what bothers you? Is it suspicion or paranoia? Intuition? An inkling? You got an inkling? I went to his home. I met his mother. I know. He told me. So, you're what? You're stalking him now? - No. - And you're threatening him. - What did you say to him? - I-I see the same thing in him - that I saw in Michael. - Michael. Michael Myers is who you are. You're not listening to me, Allyson. I am trying to protect you. I don't want your protection! But you-you can have a good life, Allyson. A good life. Just not with him. You pretend like you moved on, but it's bullshit. You're actually just obsessed with death, like it's some sort of game. And you're not gonna rest until you've finished it or until everybody else is as fucking miserable as you are! I need to get out of here before this town kills the one person that actually makes me feel something. He is on a dark path! I'm not gonna let this happen to you! You have to believe me! Believe you? You want me to believe you? Because of the hysteria that you caused when I trusted you, my friends are dead. My parents are dead. You're the one that's capable of fucking harm! You sure he turned in here, dude? Yeah, it's like his hideout or something. It's where he works. - His work is a dump. - It actually is a dump. Okay, no, but seriously, where is he? - There's the bike. - Shit, dude, pull over. This is gonna be so crazy. - Let's go. - Billy, can you hurry up? - Corey! - You're squishing me. - God. - Where'd he go? Come out, Corey! Corey, I just want to kiss and make up, my man! - Come on! - Stop being a punk! - Corey! - Where you at, man? I'll show you what happens when you mess with my dad's car! Can we hurry this up, man? Oh, I got an idea. Billy, back the car up. Bet. Grab that chain. Let's go. Terry, there's somebody in the office. Stop being a chickenshit. Run it through the wheel. All right? We're gonna tie it to the back of the car, and then we'll drag it till there's nothing left. Dusty-ass bike. Shit. - Let's go, Billy. Billy! - Come on, Terry. Hurry up, man. - Someone's here. - Billy! Come on, Billy! Let's get this punk! Let's go! Oh, my God. Billy. Billy, what are you trying to do, man? Suck your own... Oh, my God! What the fuck?! Terry? What's wrong? Billy's dead! - What? - What?! What are you talking about?! Oh, shit. Stacy? Stacy? What... what's happening?! Damn it! Stacy! Help, help, help, help! Help! You got to help me! Help me! Margo! Oh, my God! Margo! Margo! Speak to me. Are you okay? Are you okay? Stay calm. I'm gonna get you out of here. Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out. Try to be calm. It's loaded. Stay here. I don't want to die. - Help me! Help me! - Hey, hey! Hold on. Hold on. Hold still. Hold still! I'll get it off you. There he is! Corey? I got you! - I got you, you fucking psycho! - No, don't! Stacy. Stacy. God. Oh, my God. - Terry. - Margo! Terry. God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Where's Stacy? Stacy's dead. You're dead, too. - What? - Terry! No. Oh, shit. It's the zest of a lemon peel. Gives a little fresh twist. So the blueberries, obviously, are really hot. And then when it's all ready to go, we'll go and freeze the custard and then whip... Ronald? Ronald? I have laundry. I can put it in your dresser, or I can leave it in this basket here. ...this container and put it in the freezer for about, oh, half an hour to an hour so it'll firm up. Now we're gonna eat it. That looks good. A little ice cream, a little cookie... Ooh, the hotline is open, and we are taking requests. Songs for the resurrection. What's gonna get our monster out? Give us something to scream about? Caller, you're on the air. Willie, you should be ashamed of yourself exploiting these tragedies. There are three missing people right now in Haddonfield. "Beware," sir, "that when fighting monsters, "you yourself do not become a monster, "for when you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes also into you." Nietzsche also said, "Without music..." "...life would be a mistake." Can I help you? Hey, man, who the hell are you? Hey, what the f... Oh! Allyson, I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I said. I'm sorry. Please. And I just want you to come home. - 911. - Yes. I would like to report a suicide. 1206 Mill's End Road. Did you really think I'd kill myself? I have tried so hard... ...to have compassion and find mercy. But what's the point? You came here to kill me, so do it. You know, we all learn the truth about each other eventually. Did you really think that Allyson was gonna be with you? If I can't have her... You son of a bitch. What did you do? What did you do to him? No, no. No. No. Why did you do this? - No. - Corey, come back. Come back. No, no. You! Allyson, where's Laurie? We're responding to a call. She called in a suicide. No! I've run from you. I have chased you. I have tried to contain you. I have tried to forgive you. I thought maybe you were the Boogeyman. No. You're just a man who's about to stop breathing. Do it. Do it! Do it. No! I'm not gonna let this happen to you. It's okay. Get out of the way. Stay here. Just stay back. Laurie! Michael. He's dead. Not dead enough. This isn't how we do it. - You're all crazy. - What are you doing? Where are you taking him? Time for Haddonfield to start healing. Let's show them all. This is not how it works. It is tonight. Uh, stronger on radio silence. That's got to be a command. - Copy that. - Copy. Let's go. The body of Michael Myers was disposed of in a midnight procession. There would be no tombstone, no memorial. The mysteries were put to bed, and the story as we told it was to fade with time. You were right about Corey. I know he killed those people. He was consumed by evil. The events of Haddonfield that created so much violence and bloodshed finally had resolve. Reports now confirm that Michael Myers has indeed been killed dead after an attempted assault of Haddonfield resident Laurie Strode. What an incredible story of survival through decades of disturbances in our local community. Finally... New beginnings lay ahead. Fear moves through all of us, and we decide when to surrender. I've said goodbye to my boogeyman, but the truth is evil doesn't die. It changes shape. I wanted you to know I was thinking about you. I want to thank you for what you did. Enjoy. What was it you were saying about those cherry blossoms?
