I must thank Allah and my daddy There are thugs swarming on all 4 sides to kill Right In this circumstance After Allah, Sitara ma'am is the only trustworthy person That's what my dad believed Yes, my dear I thought of only you at that moment in time The clout and authority you can muster Besides all that, the trust and compassion you feel for Right That's why I asked her to first call you Yes In my entire life The only real man I have ever met Only Right Not a single man has looked me in my eye and spoken to me Right was the only exception He didn't even look at my face Why? He didn't even turn towards me but he spoke to me How can I miss him? "Scenes somehow seem wrong Teary eyed, for my life all along" "Which is reel life or real I wonder Questions in my lip's corner hover" "This is a new feeling for me I cried for the first time truly" "Birth or death, not in my control I fell in love, heart, mind & soul" "In my every breath every day you take my breath away" "You are in my vision 24x7 But you refuse to look at me even" "I yearn to get close to you But you erect fences anew" "Anchor in my life so true" "I acted in many a movie With heroes lovey-dovey" "For the first time in reality You have kidnapped me" "Wonder what's in store My heart races all the more" "Right ruler of my heart I adore" "Millions of hearts on fire To see me is their desire" "But I wonder why always you hesitate to look at my face?"

"Cold quivers hit, hug, hide It is a rollercoaster ride" "Scorches like fire, did I slip & slide?" "Needles in my heart Ripping me apart" "Will I come out a winner now from this rupture somehow?"

Run away to a place far away from my vision If you plan to do something breaking all limits I will peel you I will peel you into 2 halves I will give you exactly 17 seconds "Like an elephant on a rampage Combat, explosion and carnage" "Human sacrifice executor This tiger as the fierce predator" "One blow of his with force It is like thunder to his foes" "His grip is a tighter hazard than a monitor lizard" "Capital, this is the capital city" "City of bloodshed and brutality" "Capital, this is the capital city" "City that sets right atrocity & cruelty" "Capital, this is the capital city" "City of bloodshed and barbarity" Right Thanks 'Though she is a celebrity she's going out of her way to help you' 'You don't even look at her face when you speak to her' 'Ma'am, I thought at least now' He'll look you straight in the eye and talk At least a 'thanks'? For everything Some people here want to strengthen this case And put you behind bars closing your chapter Many of them want you to be free and outside And earn at your expense More than the star Being yours I will go to whatever extreme it takes And I will close this case completely That's a promise Now this city is in your hands Yes Right's hand Not wanting to be in this spot I preferred maintaining my distance Only that Is good for those around me Every time I grip a knife in my hand A head rolls Doesn't matter if the fallen head is mine It happens to be the head of someone I am very fond of 'I want Right dead' 'And I have to do the honors!' 'He is my account to be tallied!'
