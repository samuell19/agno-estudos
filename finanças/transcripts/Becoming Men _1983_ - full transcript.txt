(as Frank) (as Alexandre) (as Claude) (as Pierre) (as Waiter) (as Philippe) in film "Charming Cousins" Directed by Jean-Daniel Cadinot - What would you like? - A hot chocolate, please. Hey! Excuse me. I'm so sorry. - Shit! - Come with me! I'll clean it off in the toilets. If you rub it hard, it'll come off. I guess It's stained your underpants too. Let's check. Look, just like I said your pants are covered in chocolate. What would your mother say? I'll take care of it. Let me deal with it. But what if someone comes? The cruder we are the better the fun, huh? Go on, put your hand here. You'll see the difference. Caress it with your mouth. Yeah. You can get it out. It never bites little guys. This is what we call a special lesson. You're gifted in the practical side, I see. You can do better than that. It's not wet enough. Like that. Now, I'll take care of your little arse. Sit down on the sink. My turn to get you wet. It hasn't seem much action, has it? - It's the first time. - It's always the first time. And the last time. Don't tell me you don't like it. - But what if someone comes? - We'll say we're playing pinball. Go on, make your little luck leak. Now it's your go. Suck me again! You learn quickly. You're a good pupil. We'll try another position. Lie down on the sink. You got it, spread your butt cheeks. You really want it, huh? I'm coming. It's good for the skin, apparently. So, did you like it? Not disappointed? Come back whenever you want. I'll serve that up again in a hurry. Are you alone? Yes, and you are late. - I think I've done something stupid. - Is it bad? - I had sex with a guy. - Is that all? It'll pass. Now you've homework to do. I'm going to take a bath. I hope you enjoyed it, at least? Alexandre! Come and see. Yes, what is it? You know what you said earlier? Don't worry. You're not the only one. Even me. Can you imagine? Whilst you were at that holiday camp I had the two cousins at the farm. - Both of them? - Yes, but not together. I started with Pierre. What are you waiting for? You want to smoke? Go on, try it again. Ha! Your flies are undone. You shouldn't leave them like that. Your cock'll get cold! Your cock looks nice and big. Wait, I'll show you mine. We'll compare. Go on, touch it. I'm getting hard. Come on, come here. You know, in Paris, everyone does this. Go on, get it out. Get you tongue on it. Wait, I'll take down my trousers. And I'll show you how to suck cock. Pierre, Pierre, where are you? Shit! It's your mother. We'll carry on later in the barn? Be quick! I'm waiting for you. So, are you coming? After fucking Pierre, I had his brother Claude. You know? The one who calls himself Diego. Ha, on the other hand, is a good shag. A lot more vicious. The next day, we played poker. What a game! - Ooh! Pierre! - Yes. - Are you going to play poker with us? - Yes, there in a tic. Two for you, two for Pierre... So it's agreed; strip poker? The first to lose undresses. Yes. - And it won't be me. - Oh la la... me neither. So, are you playing? Not bad. The shorts, the shorts, the shorts... Yeah! Hey, guys! He washes his pants with Omo. What are you waiting for? You are dealing. He shuffles like a pro! Your bet, my friend. Everyone has a turn. He's sulking! Claude, your turn to deal. OK! The good cards are mine! Yeah! Have you got a good hand? OK, I'll start. OK, I understand. The shirt. Yeah - the shirt, the shirt! OK, your turn to shuffle. Go on, another go. Second bet, my friend. Wow! Pierre, you've bollocks poking out. You bunch voyeurs. You to deal, Frank. Philippe, you're playing. Now you have a duty! - What're we going to make him do? - Do you have an idea? - Certainly something filthy. - I know! I've got something. - What if we asked him to suck himself? - Yeah, yeah! And if you don't do it, we'll fuck you. He's lucky to be able to pleasure himself. Oh God! That's hot. Take of your pants so we can see better. My God! You're hot! That's getting me hard. Me too. Hold on, I'm coming. Cousins should help each other out. - No. - Don't worry. - There's some grease. - OK. - Mind your eyes. - Ow! Get it out, it's too big. He's swallowed all the grains. The dirty fucker! I think he likes it. He's still hard. It's too good, I can't take any more. I'm going first. It's good! I can feel the grains. You know, Frank? You've got a nice arse. - I really want to fuck you. - You must be joking. Come on, I'll let you have it. Telling you all that's made me hard. Come on! Get undressed! You'll be more at ease.
