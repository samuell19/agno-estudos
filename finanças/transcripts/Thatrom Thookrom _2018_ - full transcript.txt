She has beautiful eyes I better send her an interest I love you, baby Wow! Superb! Guys, I'm the one looking for bride Greetings The topic we have chosen for Today's debate is... ...one of the most hot topic in our state Do we need the liquor shops or not? To discuss this topic we have two important political leaders here Our State Industries Minister, Mr.Rajamanickam - Hello Sir - Hello Another one is opposition leader Mr.Dhandapani - Hello, sir - Hello Dear minister, in many places ladies are protesting against liquor shops What is the our government's stand on this? Is it important or not? Are TV serials important for ladies at home? Are YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Cricket are all important for youths? Sounds stupid Is watching TV serials, playing cricket same as the liquor shops? Ask him to talk with sense What you are talking? Do you think people started drinking after the government opened liquor shops? Drinking is a habit that dates back to ancient times Even now in villages they offer liquor to God while praying He sounds like liquor is as important as the oxygen we breathe Whatever it may be, that's fine My point is, it is not consumed with in the limits There are liquor shops in almost every street A new scheme might pop up saying 'Free liquor for smart card holders' The drunkard will spoil himself but a teetotaler will prosper Now that's a funny logic He will never allow to close the liquor shops He owns most of the government bars in the state He will lose his business That is why he is just talking nonsense His is jealous because he didn't win any seat That's what is driving him to blame me unnecessarily Blame you unnecessarily? You loot millions from the people and act innocent I expose you and you say I'm blaming you unnecessarily? The public may not be aware of all your frauds But I know everything - Stop talking like a fool! - How dare you? - Hey, it's ok - Are you kidding? Is it the way you conduct the interview in your channel? He is talking unwanted things and you're just being a mute spectator! Tell him move away Please, maintain the decorum. We are on live tv Stay out. Listen to me. Go Come on, sir These are all baseless accusations Do you have proof? Then go ahead and prove it So, only proofs can stop you from doing illegal activities? He is the one who tore the shirt of state assembly speaker Let us not blame the individuals and use strong words here Just answer his question I will answer Even though I am a minister, I'm always one among people I keep account for all my earnings I pay my taxes. Whats else do you all need? If you want to blame me then prove it with evidences Do it and I will quit from politics Quit and it'll be good for the state Thanks and Bye Boss, the head constable is here Ask him to come Sir, please come in Pandian, get him a chair to sit Have a seat What do you like to have? Beer or brandy or whiskey? Thanks, Muruga. I am here to convey something Tell me You are opening the liquor shop an hour earlier A complaint has been registered in our police station So, what about it? Send one of your man to our station We shall keep him in custody for day and leave Do you know whose bar this is? Guys who work here are dear to me Arrest them and you'll face the consequences Fine. I won't arrest any of your guys Then you must stop opening the liquor shop an hour earlier If this issue escalates then I can't help Don't create unnecessary problems Look, let this be between us Let it not reach Chinna 'With Diwali coming up...' 'The government liquor shops are given a target sale business of Rs.5 billion' Have a seat, Mr.Rajaram Thank you, sir Hope you saw the news Rs.5 billion target for liquor shops Do they want our department also to help them? Forget that... but we must stop the illicit liquors being sold Every year the government fixes such targets But they fall short The reason being that in most of the places duplicate liquors are sold Sir, this cannot happen without political support On one hand they wanna run the shop and on the other they wanna shut it On top of that a target of Rs.5 billion It's again them who smuggle and sell duplicate liquors Ok Rajaram. What can be done? If we assign this case to someone else... they will get bribed and walk away Only the honest officers like you can stop it So please take charge of it Sure sir Make sure you get the payment from Narayanan - Ok chief - And those... All liquors sent to Madurai has returned But how? The label has been pasted upside down Who was in charge of it? Dinesh Can't you get a label pasted correctly? Sorry, boss We are the best sellers in Madurai. Never failed till date! All liquors have been sent back! Happy? Can't even paste a label properly, then what are you good for? Promise it won't happen again Boss, call for you - Tell me, Muruga - Chinna? Liquor is exhausted I was expecting a call last week So the stock just got over? People here are demanding for original liquor It's a daunting task to adulterate and sell 'em Look here I don't care what you do Your customers should buy only my liquor! Okay Chinna - Listen - Yes, boss We got to deliver liquor at Murugan's bar today - I'll send - Make sure it's done Sir, AC [Assistant Commissioner] Rajaram is coming here Why in the hell is he coming here? Tell me, Sekar Chinna, is any of your liquor truck on the way to Chennai today? Yes Halt it where ever it is AC Rajaram is coming here now Send it after I tell you You want me to halt it? Then why are we bribing you? Didn't you show off that you rule the check post? Listen, the AC, Rajaram is very strict police officer Sekar, can you help us out or no?

So smuggling liquor along with fake currencies, at this hour... is quite a risk The whole police department is in our palms! You don't know about Rajaram. He is different Can't you find out when he'll come for rounds? I will get that information Then what? There is something more important So just do what we say Ok sir This must be the headlines tomorrow New boys are coming today to collect the liquor They are orphans Wait! Where to? Veerampatnam?

Let's go in that vehicle Call Pandian - Phone - Here The phone is dead Damn it! - Listen - Yes Take that walkie talkie Walkie talkie? Here you go In ECR... near Koovathur village, a 207 model vehicle, number is PY 13 6762 There are wads of fake currencies in it I don't know whose it is Sir Isn't this your jurisdiction? Where were you? I was in rounds, sir. Village...function...issues Come up with better story later For now, arrest him Sekar! There is no use of arresting me I will be bailed out tomorrow morning itself You will be the one in trouble Watch out! Sir, Chinna got arrested for carrying fake currencies Sekar, those boys escaped in my jeep! There is a bottle in that vehicle. It is very important - Last night, in the Pondicherry - Chennai stretch... near Koovathur, a man identified as Chinna... was caught red handed with duplicate liquors and fake currencies For the act of negligence and failing to do his duty... the local inspector, Sekar has been suspended It is said that accused in fake currency case, Chinna is connected to you This is your ignorance and indecency! So, Chinna is not your henchman? I have never even heard that name This incident took place near by Dhandapani's warehouse Instead of questioning him... Look, Chinna is the one arrested The right hand of the stare minister, Rajamanickam. So, go question him First stop pointing the mic at ruling party for every incident out there Like it's a clean government. Corruption, abduction and tyranny is all that is happening The government and the ministry is behind all this All these days he was just barking Now he has started biting! I'll be at peace only if I kill him! No sir. There is no chance that Dhandapani might know about the bottle Please don't make any hasty decision. Even a scratch on Dhandapani... will push media's attention to you I don't care! I need that bottle as soon as possible! I will go to any extreme for that! Chinna told me that he had kept the bottle in his jeep Those boys escaped with the jeep Catch the boys and we'll get it They why in the hell have you arrested Chinna instead of the boys? Rajaram intervened at the moment Aiyo! You guys have totally messed everything up! Make it fast Ramesh, come fast - Did you get the CCTV footage? - Yes sir Check it and let me know Hello, boss... There was a major issue when the boys were returning You must help them somehow Innocent guys. There is no fault of theirs Yes, I did get a call. I got to know everything Ask the boys to come down. I'll take care of the issue, no matter what I'll come there at once Ok boss Sir, the CCTV footage are all deleted They say that CCTV wasn't functioning Ram, step outside... and check if any of the neighboring or opposite buildings has CCTV focused here We need the details the vehicles that came in here What's behind all that? Ask them to clear it, at once! Sir, he is Chinna A native of Chennai Spends half of his time in Pondicherry He does duplicate liquor business and sells them in Pondicherry and Tamil Nadu Apart from that he does real estate, off court settlements and rowdyism Yet, there is not even a single charges pressed against him Minister of industrial development, Rajamanickam What's the use in both of us sharing this information? We need proof if we must take it up to court People believe in him Sir, minister is carrying out all his illegal activities in a very secret way He is an expert in it and he has taught Chinna the same So far Chinna hasn't been trapped in any case But he is trapped in this and that means this not just fake currency issue There is something really big behind it I think he must have gone against the minister Or else minister's enemy must have planned and trapped him - May be, sir - One second Yes, sir Ok, sir This case is moving to the CBI We need to provide all the history we have Sir, this is too early Why do you say so? Sir, as far as this case is concerned... the CBI will look into as only fake currencies case Chinna will turn himself in and go to prison Mr. Rajamanickam will escape easily If must collect all the evidences again Mr. Rajamanickam's illegal activities... then I must conducted a special inquiry on Chinna I need your permission for that Do you think Chinna will open his mouth? Chinna won't open his mouth We must make him It's difficult to bail out Chinna, sir Before handing over Chinna to the CBI... Rajaram is going to investigate him under his custody for three days Sir, if Rajaram gets the custody of Chinna then it's not good for us He is Chinna! He won't utter a word! Investigating is Mr. Rajaram. He knows to pull the truth and also bend it First, you go catch those boys! I'll handle Chinna's matter Go along with him Hello Kaaka's phone is switched off Did they return from Pondicherry? No. They got into a problem after going there - They'll come back soon - A problem? What happened? I wanna meet Kaaka, at once! I don't know where he is. I'll let you know once he comes Look there is one man Where's Pandia? - Who are you? - Where's Pandia? Where's Pandia? Where is Pandia? Can't you answer? Who are you? First, answer me! Answer me! Can't you hear me? What's the truth? I knew your friendship with those kids will lead to here All you do is bride hunting along with them You better tell where those boys are I swear, I don't know No use requesting him Damn it! Hold on. Dear, call up the boys and ask them to come here Sir... they don't have their phones We can talk to them only if they call me Is it? Then keep your phone on the table Do it! Must be the boys, right? Ask them where they are and when they'll come here Instead if you alert them... Go ahead - Talk! - You heard him! - Talk! - Hello Hello, it's me dear son-in-law My daughter is adamant that she will marry only you Working at a government bar isn't so bad! My daughter and myself are coming down to meet you I hope you'll be at the bar - Sir - Dear, son-in-law... Come on, I just gave you a happy news Why are you silent like a rat stuck on a trap? Wondering how my daughter looks? She looks like the deity Mahalakshmi in Yellow Saree Do you really need this? Bride hunting, his highness?

Tell me What? Man! Chinna who arrested last night for carrying duplicate liquor and fake currencies... was found dead under mysterious condition in Puzhal prison This incident took place when AC Rajaram was there to take Chinna in his custody Rajaram has passes an order to investigate the prisoners and cops in that prison This incident has complicated the case It is said that Chinna was a very close ally of ruling party minister, Rajamanickam They finished off Chinna? So the boys are doomed! Look. It's those guys The boys are here! Come on! - Come on! - Muruga, be where you are - Come on - Pandia... The boys are coming. Try to help them and... Now, go... Some of you go back Get them! Run! Run! Run! Come on, guys! Quick! Bro...Go! Rickshaw! Rickshaw! To the railway gate Go! Are they gone? Excuse me, where is the government bar here? Father-in-law... Is someone still looking for us? All these days I was looking for one but first time someone's looking for me Who is looking for you? My father-in-law You set out like a brave heart and promised to return with those boys? I know you won't be even able to near those boys! I wonder how you made through the police selection - We'll nab them, sir - My foot! You let the escape twice! Stop giving false promises Useless! If I trust you further, then I'm the biggest fool on this earth! I must have finished you off for the mess you have made Unfortunately, Chinna had to be finished off I feel like I lost a hand! Get lost! Go, try using your police power and see if you can still succeed! Until then don't show me your face! - You - Yes, sir - Go, get Murugan - Ok sir Don't leave him until we get hold of those boys They thrashed a bachelor like very badly But for what? Asking about the whereabouts of you three Bro, what's our fault? We are innocent No one will believe you If this is my plight for being your friend... imagine what they'll do to you guys How did the owner let that police thrash you? Owner? He was the one who brought both the cop and the thugs They are running wild like chameleons If they get us, they'll rip us apart! Come, let's go to the hospital For what? Get our autopsy done? How about we get someone's help? Tell me who's that someone? And ask for what help? Will you tell 'em about the smuggled liquor? Or about the fake currencies? Or about the breaking the check post? Stop blabbering without knowing what's going on So, what do we do now? Abscond to some faraway place To where? Like you always wished for, go abroad Are you kidding? Tell me, are you kidding? You can't live here and escape from the cops and minister's thugs Foreign sounds safe I ain't Vijaya Mallaya to escape to foreign Who's that Malliga?

Opposition Leader Dhandapani died in a car accident His driver is also died in the accident This accident took place at East Coast Road near Koovathur The police department says that they are inquiring the workers of there Superb! Superb! Superb! Now, we are going to mint money from Minister Confused? Enough of escaping Let's not let them escape anymore What is so important about this bottle? Minister is ready to throw millions for it Why should we bother about that? What matters is how much will minister pay for this bottle? They took away our peace We must snatch it back What if those boys expose us to the minister? We must get them before that happens What can we do? We must not give up until we win! I'm sure there is way Minister should not get hold of the boys You! What you are doing? Sir, we thought Dhandapani was behind everything But Dhandapani is dead now Then who must be having the bottle? By midnight 8th November 2016 Current Five Hundred and One Thousand Rupee currency notes... won't be legal and are invalid hereafter Let's not spare anyone of them! " Two currencies are no more valid now" " Queues in the ATMs are raising eyebrows" " All dressed up but now a beggar" " Now the rich and poor are one flock, flying together" "There is nothing now in everyone's purse" " For some it's even worse" " Those who piled up all that money..." " it's all gone now, honey!" " No cash!" " Time to swipe and pay" " No cash!" " Time to celebrate simply" " No cash! No cash! No cash!" " Time to learn the old ways" " No cash! No cash! No! No! Cash! Cash!" " Time to close our eyes and enjoy this phase" Can nothing be done without that chip? Without it we'll have to break open the locker But it will be considered as theft We must nab the boys and minister must believe me Also must find out the worth of that bottle " Life is like the fake currency" " Breaking news now has shocking tendency" " Money saved with great efforts is of no use now" " Money snatched by the frauds are now white somehow" " Well, we played our parts as the citizen" " Like blinds we trusted them" " Young and the old standing in the same queue" " We though that's the end cue" " Enter the new tax rule!" " No cash!" The money we got is now ivalid But why? Seems like they are putting an end to black money!

Drink Sekar, how would you feel if you drink was poisoned?
