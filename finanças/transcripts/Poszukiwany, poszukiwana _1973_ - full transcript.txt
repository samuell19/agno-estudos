We got it! WANTED: MALE OR FEMALE Starring Written by Music Director of photography Directed by - Move it to the right. - This way? Stop. Come and take a look. Why don't we move it... Don't come in! It's you, sir. You're never there when I call. Not too keen on work, are you? Sorry. I'm busy with the Dutch exhibition. I take it you've met? - Stanislaw Maria Rochowicz. This is... - Bogdan Adamiec. Artist and painter. Yes, we've met. Mr. Rochowicz has approved the purchase of my painting. Mr. Adamiec claims you agreed to make alterations on his painting bought... - When was that? - In January. You were there. Are you crazy? You want to paint over a painting? It's a misunderstanding. I want to make the alterations. The use of black is inappropriate. I have a new idea. The black doesn't predominate over the blues. The blues are too soft. If I change the blues, the black will not stand out. I see. I'm responsible for all purchases. They can't get into strange hands. What strange hands? I know it's a work of your hands. But it's against regulations. I have my paints with me. l'll do it here, give me thirty minutes. - You promised. - I did? When? You forgot? What did you say when we were cruising hotel bars? “Mate, we can get into the museum and paint over Matejkds masterpiece”. You made a bet that you'd crawl back home on all fours. How very interesting. I have no objections. You can alter your paintings as you wish. If this experiment works, people will fall to their knees, you included. Visitors will be amazed to see me paint a painting hanging on the wall. This dead place needs some life. It's not dead. It's our sculpture storeroom. Your painting is in the painting storeroom. A storeroom? lt's not displayed for the public? You think we display purchased paintings? No offence, the museum buys them to help artists out. Yours was bought so you could earn money for a living. It's outrageous! You deprive people of contact with modern art. I'll exhibit your works when you build a second wing to our museum. I do it for people. It's the last time I sold my painting to the museum. - It sure is. - How do you know? I won't buy any more from you. It's government money. Say you'll paint a masterpiece like Mona Lisa. L'll buy it from you and they'll ask: “Why did you buy it?”. L'll answer: “lt's a masterpiece”. They'll say:”We disagree”. “Rumour has it you got a share from Mr. Adamiec”. How will I explain it? Itjust proves my point. People crave art. We both know it must have been stolen by a sensitive an lover. He was so desperate to experience art, he committed a crime. Did we search the storeroom? We did. Is there another one? No. You're responsible for the storeroom. It didn't just evaporate. L'll tell the press that an an lover stole the work of a Polish painter. They'll publish a picture of my latest works. So there! You're responsible for the storeroom. You'll answer for neglect. Fine. I can be responsible for that storeroom ifl get security guards. - It's too late. - I know. Statues worth millions are in ruin because there's no money for security. That's irrelevant. Don't be so upset. If you give that painting back, we'll drop the charges. - Why would I steal that painting? - Sit down, please. You know why. To sell it. Who'd buy such crap? lt's worthless. Worthless? What is your monthly pay? 1600 zlotys. Really? And you say that a painting worth 20000 is worthless? “The thief is a sensitive and educated an lover. He ignored kitsch. He went straight for a work of great value. Prices in hotel bars are quite high. A bottle of vodka costs... He was seen walking on all fours”. On all fours? In mid-winter? Shame on you. I could arrest you immediately. But we don't want our country to lose an through illegal export. You'll get one last chance. I expect to see you with the painting by 3 pm. tomorrow. Or with your toothbrush. What penalty does the law provide ifl don't make it by 3 p.m.? You'll get five years. I suggest you start looking. By 3 p.m. It's not there. I'm in trouble. - They can't put you in jail. - They can. It's a nightmare. Until now jail was just an empty word. And suddenly bang! It's real. Barred windows, an iron cot, a blanket. I can't take it! I have to run away, disappear. - Who's that? - l'll get it. It's Adamiec. I'm done for! - I'll open it. - No way. Pretend you're in bed. I'm coming! I'll just get dressed! - Is Mr. Rochowicz in? - He's not home. - Who painted these? - My husband. You like them? - It's crap. I'm Adamiec. - How can I help you? - You're his wife? - Yes. Talk to him. We can make a deal if he contacts me with the buyer. What buyer? I bet your husband didn't steal my painting for himself. - He did it for a marchand. - Who? An art dealer in Paris or London. Whatever. He spotted an opportunity when he saw my hand motif. I'll paint a whole series of hands - male, female, in black and white. People will love them! Your husband will get 10 per cent. It's a good deal. I need to contact that guy. My husband is in a nearby cafe. Let's go. I didn't realize myself what a great idea it was. - My eyes are open now. - Let's go. - I've primed thirty large canvasses. - I'm sure he's in a cafe. What are you doing here, Miss? Crocheting. In my house? Get out or I'll call the police. Don't you dare. - Is that you? - Yes. You didn't recognize me? - Good. That's what I hoped for. - Are you crazy? Nobody will recognize me. I'll hide in this disguise for a month or two until I paint a copy of that painting. - From memory? - No. Look. I have the details. Nobody will assume it's fake if it has a signature. We'll put it back in the museum and that's it. When the police come, we'll say you're my older sister. - Older? Why? - Don't be silly. I can't live with you. It may look suspicious. I have to move out. Let me see... it's better now. Take the necklace off. Don't move! That gentleman? OK. - Excuse me... - Yes? Good morning. What is your pay demand? Let's say five hundred. Will three hundred be OK? Three hundred and eighty. It's mid-month... Five hundred, board and lodging. You'll cook, clean, do the laundry. - And take care of Sonia. - Who? - Our doggy. - She likes women. - Can I have a word with you? - We'll be back. Sonia! Stay! Wait! You're hired. Whafs your name? Stan... Maria. - Where have you worked before? - For Mr. and Mrs. Rochowicz. Why did you leave? They split up. But they were pleased with my work. I have references. Excuse me. What a gem. You finally made your minds up. She's not very pretty. Congratulations. She'll have to take time off at night. There's one problem. I lost my ID card. So? I won't be able to register my residence. What? You want to register your residence here? - In that case, goodbye. - Goodbye. No! Listen, we hired that woman as a maid five years ago. She registered her residence and quit her job a month later. She never moved out. Even when we change apartments, she goes with us. Buy me a flat and l'll go! I'll kill her. Go to the kitchen and unpack. - Where's the kitchen? - Here. We eat breakfast at 7 am. Honey, I had a nightmare. I dreamed I was a maid. That won't be enough. Two of them, me and doggy. Darn it! Too yeasty. You can let Sonia off the leash. They like to play together. - I'm afraid she'll run away. - She won't. She's very obedient when she's out with her mistress. Why do they have such a big dog? They must love her. They can't stand her. But she's their breadwinner. - Really? - Sonia is a three-time champion. They get 5000 for every puppy. She has four or five at a time. It adds up to a nice sum. A dog needs to run. - I have to run with her? - No. Sit. Alex, fetch! Sit. Get her out of the water. She'll catch cold. Whose dog is it? Her mistress will be mad! Get a canoe. Hurry! Come here! Careful! You'll scratch your legs. Wait. I'll pull you out. - Here you go. - Thanks. Great. - Nice dog. - It's a bitch. I know. I can tell the difference. Some say I'm an expert - Really? - Heavy, isn't he? I mean she. Sixty kilos or more when wet. - I have an offer for you. - Lay off. Don't be so rude and crude. Lay off or l'll punch you! Touchy, are you? Want to make a career, travel, have fun? I'll call the police! Have you heard about a shot putter named Lobzéwna? I made her. A storm is coming. I have to run. Had your run? I certainly did. - Rawicz speaking. - Can I speak to Kasia? - Sure. Kasia! - Yes? It's for me? - Hello? - Kasia? - It's you. - I made dumplings. They're hard. Hard? Maybe you used plaster. Plaster? I'll check. Hello? Is this ajoke? My pork chops are burning. Why? - Did you put oil in the pan? - What for? The meat was fat. I can't talk know. I'm busy. You think the phone is bugged? You may be right. - It's possible. - Bye. Thank you. What is this? - What? - This. - A shirt. - My best shirt. Sorry. I'll take it and... Sonia! Don't let it happen again! - What is this? - Well? Eat. - I can't. l'll kick her out. - Don't be silly. You won't find a maid in Warsaw for that money. - What if she starts stealing? - l'll fire her if I catch her. Eat. - I can't. - She'll be upset and leave. - Did you eat yours? - I put it in the bookcase. L'll throw it out when she takes the dog out. - I can't eat. Here, doggy. - Stop it! You'll poison our dog. - Don't you know who's speaking? - Who is it? It's me. The little girl who lived with you. - Wrong number. - lt's Stasia speaking. I know you have an appendectomy scar and you use baby cream. Is that you, Robert? - What Robert? - My doctor, you idiot. Your doctor? OK. What do you want, little girl? Bye. - I heard voices. Who's here? - Nobody. - I definitely heard somebody. - It must be the neighbours. I'm sure I did. Hello? lt's you. Yes, I complained about hot water problems. Can you come today? Sure. lfl said I'd come, l'll come. - Great. No, wait. You can't come. - Why? My mom may be watching my house. Let's meet in a park. It's nicer there. You know why it's nicer in a park. - What about your tap? - What tap? I'll take the hot water tap with me. How sweet. You tell me to watch out for taps and you want to come in daytime? Are you making fun of me? Fix your taps yourself! Hello! Hello! Can you get me a napkin? In the bottom drawer. Thank you. - Maria... - I can... Don't explain. Who was with you last night? - With me? - Yes. - My brother. - He won't be there tonight. I will. Open up. lt's me, your master. Come in! It's no use. You won't find it. We won't call the police. We have no proof. If she stole it, she took it out of the house. Let's fire her. We'll hire a new maid. Younger and cleaner. Are you crazy? lt's a gold ring with a precious stone. - L'll give her a body search. - I'll do it. She won't strip in front of you. Let me do it. Maria! Come with me. Well? Nothing. She's clean. - You fired her? - No. What about the ring? - We'll find it. lt's no big deal. - No big deal? - It was small and old. - It was antique. Whatever. Whatever? - Jesus! She's gone! - You're right. She must have run away. - I found the ring. - I could kill you! We don't want to leave Antoé alone at home. He's a nervous child. Please be careful. Our previous maid was physically on the weak side. Our son is quite fit. Too fit. I advise you to wear rubber boots. - Rubber boots? - He likes to bite at ankles. Stop this nonsense, you'll scare her. Everything will be fine. We're going to the theatre. Make sure he's in bed by 9 pm. Read to him. Can you read? - What? - Read. Sure. What should I read? Fairy tales. Take care of everything. I suggest you read “Playboy”. Hey, you. Come over here. Move! What are you staring at? Never seen a radio before? Don't touch it! It's an expensive device. Come here! Get up. You're not on holiday. I'm going to a movie at half seven. - You mean half past seven. - Whatever. I'm off. - You're not going. - Why? Your mom said you should be in bed by nine. And you'll read fairy tales to me? Bullshit. - What did you say? - Bullshit! That wasn't nice. You want to teach me manners? I'm going to a movie. Wait. I told you what your mom said. You'll go to bed. If you touch me, I'll tell mom. She'll kick you out. - Pick it up. - OK. You...! Lesson one of good manners. - You understand? - Yes. - What time is it? - 12 pm. Be back here by 12:50. Go. Hello! If we alternately took care of the kids, we'd have some free time. It's too much. Come on. Amos' is a typical product of our times. If you bribe or threaten him, he's as meek as a lamb. You want free time for dates? - Not really. - Why? What if I prefer girls? I heard about sexual deviations at my course. - But I never met anybody like that. - I was just kidding. - When you sit near me, I feel... - What do you feel? Stop it. About that course. Why don't you take it? Soon I'll make enough money to study history of art. - History of art? Why? - To advance in life. - Hello, Maria. - Hello. Can I have a word with you? What are you doing here? I changed my job. I'm working for the Gérecki family. Why? My previous employer suspected something. I think she knew... - What? - That I'm not a woman. Dont worry. I get a thousand a month now. - Really? - Look what I have for you. Cafe? Let me speak to that guy who's waiting for a call. Art gallery here. We have a visitor. lt's a woman. Don't get too close. You should admire paintings from a distance. Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. I'm Bogdan Adamiec, painter. - I know. - You know me? - You introduced yourself. - Right. - You went shopping? What do you do? - I'm a housekeeper. Fantastic! How long have you been interested in art? I was just passing by. What a pity the TV crew is not here. Can you come tomorrow? I'll call them and we'll reenact this scene all over again. This kind of thing doesn't happen every day. Nobody will believe me. It may be crowded tomorrow. Can I have your autograph? You're welcome. Sign identically as your paintings. What do you do to prevent glaze from shining? I use a palette knife. I mix oil paint with turpentine to bring out depth. I remove all barriers. These hands seem to reach out to the viewer... Wake up. Did you see anybody? - A woman. - What woman? They won't believe me again! What do you want to be when you grow up? - A hustler. - What? My friends dad is a currency dealer. He's loaded. They may be well off, but people don't respect them. I bet your friend is ashamed of his parents. - You're strong, but so dumb. - Watch your words. What planet are you from? He gets top grades in school. It means he studies hard. What? He pays his friends to do his homework for him. It won't do him good. Money can't buy education. Come on. He'll give backhanders. Stop nagging, I'm bored. You're bored? Here. I made a slingshot for you. Don't aim at people! Take this. Go! Hello! I had to wait for you in this heat. Sorry. I'll make you feel cooler. Don't splash me! * See? ' Stop it! Hello. - It's good yours here. Let's go. - No, thanks. l'll sit. - Can I have a word with you? - No. - Don't be so stubborn! - Let me go! - You're not cooking lunch today? - Where did you get that wig? I bought it. - Who gave you money? - I had my own. Tell Mrs. Gérecka I'll come to that party. Rawicz invited me. - Who's Rawicz? - He's my boss. - No way! - Don't be silly. I'll tell her. Say hello to your boss. Goodbye. - What's all this about? - I'm jealous. - So it's true. How do you do it? - Do what? - You know. A girl with a girl. - Stop it. Maniac! Excuse me... Sorry. Mr. Rawicz... You're naughty, Mr. Rawicz. - Excuse me. - No problem. - Don't you feel too hot? - It's not hot enough. - I'll get your coat. - Don't bother. - Would you like tea or coffee? - No. We don't want any orange, tomato or grapefruit juice. How about lemon juice? Can I have a word with you? Do you have a room here? Give me the key, will you? - No way. - l'll give you a hundred. - Is that all she's worth? - How much do you want? I don't want money. She's married. I heard. - She loves her husband. - I heard about him. He's a crook. Not really. He was charged unfairly. He's a very good man. - Stop your advances. - Stop bothering me. - Leave her alone. - You leave me alone! Wait. You don't have to clean. Or cook. I eat out. You don't have to do the laundry. Do you have a boyfriend? No. All women say that. Later it turns out they do. Never mind. You can invite him to your room. Only there. What are my duties? You'll see. lt's important you keep your mouth shut. Not a word about me to anybody. And stay away from the bathroom. Where will I wash? There's a sink in the kitchen. And a separate loo. Speaking of your duties. This is a map. I've marked all grocery stores. Every morning you'll go to five stores and buy five kilos of sugar and yeast. You can go to each store only once. If you run out of stores in our district, you'll go to further ones. Is that all? - How much is the sugar? - 525 zlotys. Here you are. Thank you. - It's heavy. - I live nearby. - Want a hand? - No, thanks. Goodbye. - What is this? - I bought two sacks to stock up. What did I tell you? Buy no more than five kilos in one store. I'm sorry. You're doing harm to Polish science. I'm working on a major invention. To determine the content of sugar in sugar depending on radiation. In one store the content of sugar in sugar is 80 percent after a yearly shelf life, while in another it's 90 percent. Saccharin has 500 percent! Quiet! Thanks to my invention we wont have to grow sugar beets. We'll have sugar in sugar! Five kilos of sugar, please. I'll take five... make it six kilos! - Take it easy, lady. - Sorry. You want to sit down? Go ahead. There's room for two. Leave me alone! I was just trying to be polite. She bawled me out! I gave my seat up to a lady before and I'm paying alimony now. - Let go of my bag! - What? Your briefcase got caught in my string bag! - You want me to call the police? - Listen, you... What? Wait! Your bag! Professor! What? Is anybody at the door? No. I'm through with riding trams or buses. - Something happens to me every time. - OK. l'll think of something. - Professor, I lied to you. - What do you mean? About that boyfriend. I don't have one, I have a girlfriend. - Can she visit me? - OK. But don't let her walk around here. Go straight to your room. - OK. - We'll lock the door. Whafs all this sugar for? The professor makes experiments. How's yourjob? Mr. Rawicz had an accident. - Really? What happened? - He got hit. - Accidents happen. Where is he now? - In the hospital. That's done. We got money for you. My monthly pay. - I'll save it for our apartment. - Good. What have you done? You dumped packs of sugar into one bag? I took notes which are from which store. These are from the delicatessen, and these from the supermarket... Didn't anybody find it suspicious? Did anybody follow you? Watch you? No. Why? I have to keep my experiments secret. Nobody can find out. I thought you wanted to determine the content of sugar in sugar. That's right! And radioactivity. You wouldn't understand! I told you to buy five kilos of sugar and get back home. Home! You understand? Take it off my pay. I'll throw this sugar out. No! l'll throw it out myself! Whafs going on in there? I'm coming! Just a minute! Whafs wrong? Nothing. We got a toothache. Take a painkiller. I have to go. l'll be back tonight. Fine. I forgot my... What is this? I won't tell anybody. I had no idea it was a large scale production. You're dead right you won't tell anybody. Stay here! Maria! Come out here. Come out! Come here. I did some thinking. There is a solution. - What? - You'll be my wife. - Me? - Yes. You'll be my wife. - What? You don't like me? - That's not the point. Quiet! I'll be good to you. - It's not possible. - Why? I'm proposing to you. - It's not possible. - Why? - Because I can't. - What do you mean? Why? Thafs why. Brilliant operation. Well done. You're a police officer. Go on, lieutenant. Call your squad. Tough luck. - I'll take a bunch of carrots. - I have nice tomatoes. I'll come tomorrow. - Maria! I have fresh lettuce! - No, thanks. Try my delicious cherries. - Want some? - Maybe tomorrow. We'll wait with lunch for my husband. Excuse me, what does he do? My husband is a manager. I'd like to thank all of you for your cooperation. I'm moving on to a new job in a highly responsible sector. Its the Central Urban Development Institute. Thank you. - What exactly is yourjob now? - I'm building towns. - How much will you make? - More than in waterworks. More than for rationalization? - That was in cement works. - What's the difference? There it was easy to calculate if savings measures generated losses. Here I don't sign anything. Maybe it's for the best. Just remember what that guy told you... What did he say? That all thafs left for you is local industry. - Fine. - I'm not moving from Warsaw. You think local industry is where? They have their headquarters right next to the institute. - Here in Warsaw? - Sure. Don't worry. I just started work. Soon l'll reorganize everything. You know how long it takes to build a town? Three years. Then you have to deal with defects, complaints. lt's four years easy. Don't say anything in front of her. - She's too stupid to understand. - You're right. - What are these? - Cooperative high-rises. I see. Thafs the lake. Well, in that case... No, it's OK. We'll move the lake here. Wake up. There's somebody to see you. Shall I let him in? Yes. Come in. Good day. Excuse me, you forgot to sign invoices. We can't pay out. Have a seat. Let... what's his name Kownacki sign them. - It's in your name. - Let me see. You'll get paid. For what? Author's fees for adjusting the town planning project. OK. - How are you doing? - I'm fine. - Any problems? - No. - Everything is fine? - Yes. Here you are. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. I don't think you should write. Focus on the spoken word. Remember what that guy said? - What? - You know. I have to finish it. Its not hard. I'll read the introduction to you. “Challenges posed by life to spatial development have contributed to the expansion of construction work. One example is the urbanization project of Michaiéw district”. It - I can't find the right word - quarrels, opposes , is against... Clashes. Good. Clashes. No, it clashes with a larger, broader concept... General concept. “It clashes with the general concept outlined last February”. - Maria? - Yes? - Did you prompt me? - Anything wrong? Thafs not the point. I'm amazed you know such words. You bring home so much literature. I read while I cook. Did you read this article? It's nonsense. A guy wants to tear down 19th century buildings to build beer bars. Shops, not beer bars. New buildings replace relics. Why do it when relics are in good condition? These relics will outlive many new buildings. The concept of tearing down 19th century buildings is a relic. Today they're just as valuable as 18th century architecture. We can find many great examples of Secession style. Maria? I know Polish Secession does not equal that of Odessa or Vienna... Maria? Sorry, my soup will burn. No! Sit down. That article you helped me with. I got 2800 zlotys for it. Let's split the fee. You'll get 1800. Is that OK? Sure. Thank you. We could write more articles. We have to find a good topic. There you are! Thanks a lot. You got me into trouble. Local industry, here I come! What happened? Maria came up with this new concept. What's it called? The concept of integrating historic buildings into urban landscape. - It's a very good concept. - Thafs right. You said it yourself. It's too good. It caused a great stir. Have you read the papers? Sure. They say it's a revolution in urban development. Who asked you for a revolution? It's pandemonium. We have to receive architects, consultants. Congratulations keep coming in. The TV wants to do an interview. Great. You were never interviewed before. Dont you get the point? For many years nobody bothered me. I know people who had new concepts. Now they're history. No way. You have to take it all back. You'll do it personally. - I can't. You're good at it. - You're a great speaker. I can speak on general topics, I can highlight the international situation. When it comes to details, Maria has to do it. I want you to be present at that interview. You'll be my... Consultant? Thafs right. l'll explain. Put my suit on. I can't have a woman consultant. You're a maid. They'll laugh at me. Put it on. We'll cut your hair. It's no big deal. We did things like that when I worked in entertainment. - Get changed. - But... No buts. Stop fussing. How long does it take to change? Something is wrong. Your hair. Thafs how men wear it nowadays, especially artists. Walk around the room. Put your hand in your pocket. Sit down. Men don't sit that way. Of course. Men walk this way. And they sit this way. Thafs right. Maybe it's the tie. Stop interfering! Damn it! Put a tie on. Not that one! Pick a nice one. - How about this one? - OK. Good. See? The suit doesn't fit. Theres a trunk in the kitchen closet. Get it. I've kept one of my suits from old times. If that damned maid broke her leg, it'll be the end of me. - What is this? - Why haven't you changed? - What is this? - It's a painting. What about it? Where did you get it? Ifs not a good time to talk about paintings. Get changed. Where did you get it? I don't know. Where did we get it? Remember when you worked for the Central Museum Management? A client came to see you. How did it get here? - What? - This painting. The wall was bare so I decided to find something in the storeroom. What can I do for you? - So nobody stole it? - Stole what? Nobody stole it. I had it taken down when I saw it was scaring clients off. - Whafs this about? - You didn't sign a receipt? As a manager? I didn't need to. Why aren't you dressed? Exactly, why? Whafs this about? Maria! Come out! Maria, it's me. Open up! - Very good. - What? - Excellent disguise. - Goodbye. Great glasses. Come here. - I have to go. - Where? - Home. - What home? - Home to my wife. - You have a wife? - Of course. - And kids? Not yet. But I want to. Now I have to find a good name for you. - I have a name. - What is it? - Stanislaw Maria Rochowicz. - Good. Maria! How do I get to Powiéle? Go straight along Lazienkowska thoroughfare. - It's you! My poor darling, at last! - What's going on here? I've moved our things to our new apartment. Did the police tell you they dropped the charges? - They said something... - Why didn't you tell me? - Maria, I... - Don't call me Maria! - Listen... - What? Why didn't you tell me? - I didn't tell you? - No. You said that when were financially stable, you can do research work. And we can have a baby. 80 if you work as a maid... - A maid? - You'll work mornings. Are you crazy? What are you saying? You want me to humiliate myself so you can buy more rags? I slave away for people and make a fool of myself! - Let's go to our apartment. - Leave me alone! You think l'll calm down? No! - Why didn't you tell me? - I told you why. - No, you didn't. - I did. You told me nothing. I make a fool of myself, dress up as a woman... Nice! A pleasant breeze. - I'm turning right. - Why? Go straight. - Why straight? - I want to go straight. - It'll be faster. - Sit down! - Do as I say! - Don't touch the steering wheel! - Easy on the brakes! - It's OK. You'll ruin the car! - Go on, help me. - OK. Push harder. Hit it. - Now the top. - Don't pull! - Look at the time. - So what? So nothing! Nice wheels! - Nice guy. - I bet he's a hustler. Hello! You think you can drive over people's feet? I'll get you! Good morning. THE END English subtitles: lwona Morenc STUDIO PUBLISHING
