- If you say we're going rock climbing, you're going rock climbing. But the description for canyoneering would be we're going hiking, wading, swimming, rock climbing, rappelling over waterfalls. - Inverted mountaineering is the negative space of the mountain, and all you're doing is descending. You're not climbing up, you're going down all the time. - It's almost like caving in a way. A little bit of challenge and a little swimming kinda dark, kinda cold. Have to do things a little differently than when you're just walking. - The beautiful thing about canyoneering as a sport is rappelling and down climbing, getting in the water and splashing around and having fun. It brings out the kid in us. - That's looking pretty good. We used to call it gorging. We thought that's what it really sounded like 'cause you're going down a narrow gorge and we'd get sandpapered. - Originally, people had a very narrow concept of what a canyon is. If you say you're going to Utah or northern Arizona to go canyoneering, they say, "Ah, yeah, the Grand Canyon." But canyoneering can be practiced anywhere there are mountains. I live in Cedar City, Utah, and you'd think the people of Utah would all know what canyoneering is, but I'm always amazed that I meet people in my town that I tell them canyoneering and they say "Is that like with a canoe?" - Now the experience of the climbing inside these gashes in the Earth is called slot canyoneering and it's not something to be taken lightly. - A hopelessly obscure sport, canyoneering found recognition only after occasional TV appearances. - Aaron amputated his arm below the elbow, utilizing his pocket knife. - The most remarkable, airing in 2003, when news of a man trapped by a boulder captivated a global audience. - I feel that I did what I had to do. - Before the publicity, stories about canyoneering's origins included river pioneers and even more primitive inhabitants. But for decades, as countless hideaways laid uncharted, canyoneering remained accessible only to the most intrepid explorers. - So, we go northeast and we should hit that rim just right. So, okay. - By 1986, with barely enough participants to be considered a sport, canyoneering was edging into mainstream's periphery with the arrival of a guidebook. Featuring over 100 canyon adventures with photos of surreal topography, the book was as beautiful as it was obscure. - My main distributor at that time was a guy in Salt Lake. He took it down to one store and he introduced the book there and the guy looked at him funny and he said "Where's the Colorado Plateau?" He said, "Boy, I think you've got a problem here "because these guys don't know "where the Colorado Plateau is." - Despite it's pragmatic name, the vast desert region had already captivated the tenacious guidebook author from Provo, Utah. - We gotta be 100 meters from that last end of the last little slot, the one we walked through. There's a little teeny drainage and that's what we're looking at right here. When I got into it, it was an unexplored area basically. Just all these neat canyons, you don't find them anywhere else in the world. We can do this. Oh, if we come in there. That's the slanted part I remember seeing. I enjoy going through the slot canyons. I mean, it was just fun for me, and I figured, well, slot canyons are for everybody too. Oh, shit, eh, that worked. I was one of the first guys out there to do a guidebook for this region. I was in that first wave of people starting to write guidebooks. - A prolific adventurer, Mike Kelsey's earliest feats were detailed in guidebooks on mountain hiking. Among his first published, was the inexhaustible world guide, listing over 600 ascents across the globe. The book included his attempt to solo climb the Himalayan peak, Masherbrum. Discovering exciting terrain closer to home, Mike's canyon guides featured accessible walk through treks, but his work began on a new edition. He hoped to include an entirely different kind of adventure. - I could see that the best scenery, the neatest slot canyons, though they were the darkest and maybe the most water sculptured and they're the ones with dropoffs, so you had to rappel. I knew then that this was the next step in adventure. - The terrain that had caught Mike's attention was called technical canyoneering, referring to steep, vertical canyons with drop offs. And while thousands of technical canyons existed, they remained accessible only to those with climbing skill and equipment. - The tunnel that goes through the east entrance of Zion goes right by Pine Creek. In the old days, you could stop in the tunnel. You could look over into this canyon. And I saw some amazing things out those windows and I decided that I wanted to go in there. - Nearly a decade before Mike had written his first book, a deep canyon in Zion National Park had captured the attention of a young climber named Dennis Turville. The year was 1977 and the canyon Dennis planned to descend dropped over 300 feet within a half mile. With hazardous obstacles lurking in the darkness below, Pine Creek was considered more a tomb than a climbing project. - I realized that I needed two 150 foot climbing ropes. I needed full on climbing gear, a wet suit for any pools that might be down there, that probably were. And then I brought the last missing piece of the equation and that was a climbing buddy, Dean. - You know, we'd been on plenty of adventures together at that point, so it was pretty easy to say yes. The only weird part was, yeah, we're going down instead of going up. What's with that? It seemed to me pretty unimposing initially, but then once you get to the spot where it just all of a sudden turns vertical down. When you can't see the bottom, where you're going, there's the unknown down there. - I had gotten to the first big rappel in Pine Creek and it was a place we called the Cheese Rock Factory. The water over eons of time had worn different holes through the rock and it literally looked like the sandstone was Swiss cheese in there. I got off of the fourth rappel and I was walking through this beautiful white sand and I'm realizing no one's ever been here before. I'm it. I'm the first guy to walk through here. We were the first humans to see this and that just sent shivers up my back and it made me wanna do more of them. Every time we went out, we were doing a first descent. We had canyon after canyon after canyon without anybody around to see anywhere. Sometimes when we walked out of Zion Narrows afterwards with packs and ropes and clanking pieces of iron, people would look at us pretty funny. We could see the questions forming in their head, but they didn't dare ask them. And that was good. - While accessing terrain where few could follow, Dennis explored canyons in solitude for nearly 20 years. - I do remember him pouring over 7.5 minute topos to really look for skinny little canyons. Ones where the actual contour crosses the creek. - Most of our names have to do with our impressions of the canyon when we went through it. Troll's Treat was because we felt like we were a bunch of trolls carrying our packs through this canyon. And treat because it was fun. We felt we had a reason to name them just as climbers name climbing routes. We were naming our canyon routes after whatever we felt like because we were the first ones through. We had the right. These canyons just led me toward others that were getting increasingly more difficult, longer, harder to get to, harder to get out of. And as we found more and more challenges, we found techniques to match those problems. We realized then that what we were doing was a special thing. That it was intensely enjoyable but it was rigorous, and it wasn't for everybody. - By 1997, as work began on a fourth edition guidebook, Mike had acquired technical climbing gear. - I got into Zion and did some rappels. Went down Pine Creek. I started thinking, you know, maybe there is room for another type of guide here because this'll add a little more flavor, a little more adventure to just canyon hike, just walking down a boring canyon. The best canyons out there are the ones you have to use ropes to get through. It introduces people to a new challenge there, a step up in adventure. - Delving into deeper, more challenging terrain, Mike's work marked a dramatic new twist on guidebooks as mundane hikes were updated with thrilling new rappelling routes. But before the book went to print, the quaint sport would make an unexpected debut when on a summer afternoon in 1997, a startling event sent shock waves across the nation. - Thundering flash floods swept away 12 people. 11 of them died. - The eighth and ninth bodies were found later. Searchers never found any trace of the other two. - It was on international news and the Navajos said that they got a tremendous number of phone calls because people never knew that landscapes like that existed. There they are watching their TV in New Jersey or wherever they are and looking at this tight little sandstone slot canyon. So the interest spiked. - As inquiries flooded in, it was the arrival of the internet and accessible information that fueled the excitement. As canyoneering was ripped from obscurity, Zion National Park witnessed the first wave of participants. - A lot of local folks had known about the slot canyons in Zion for a number of years. But with the advent of the internet, all of a sudden that information was out there for large numbers of people. - I think guidebooks and the internet both appeared at roughly the same time, but both of them, coupled together, it all just created a firestorm of canyoneering interest. - This is called standard mode. If I want a little more friction, I can drop it here and that's called vertaco. So, this is the textbook way of doing it, but I've seen students that will come over the top this way to add more friction, and that's okay. And they go under here. I've had a few come over here and then go over the top. And there's all kinds of different ways that'll work. So, I like it because it's somewhat idiot proof. - As recreationalists arrived to try the new sport, a young professional guide from Phoenix, Arizona assembled a teaching group called the American Canyoneering Association. - When people started publishing guidebooks, it made a huge difference in the amount of traffic in the canyons and the number of people that got into it because all of a sudden they're more accessible. We felt like canyoneering was gonna get enough promotion on its own, all we wanted to do was once you become a canyoneer, can we help you become more safe. Safe and efficient solutions, right? - Before establishing the ACA, Rich Carlson made his living bringing clients on climbing and mountaineering excursions. An outdoor enthusiast throughout his life, Rich had discovered canyoneering in the late '70s, experiencing the solitude of the sport's formative years. But during one early adventure, Rich found himself in a precarious situation. - Well, at the time I wasn't thinking of going down a canyon as being something technical. All I was thinking was I was out for a hike that would have a little bit of scrambling to it. - In a naive oversight, 21 year old Rich had climbed down without considering his ability to reverse the move. - Going down canyon and realizing I couldn't go any further, the oh shit moment was coming back and assuming it would be easy to go back up what I just came back down. It was at that point where I saw those two drops and being stuck in between them, when I realized, man, someone could get killed in here. - Ready? - Yeah. - When I finally managed to get out and got back to my car, I was thinking, I am so stupid. I am so stupid, I will never do that again. Okay, who's up? I feel like part of my job is to instill a respect for all the great things about the sport, the beauty and the adventure and so on and so on, but also instill that there are risks in this sport. - Going down a canyon is easier than going up a mountain. All you have to do is rappel. Once you know how to rappel, rappelling isn't that big of a deal. That's the simplest part of canyoneering. - Canyoneers can easily get themselves deeper into the doodoo than a rock climber can. A rock climber has to go up first. And if you get to a point where you can't go any higher, your partner lowers you down and it's over. In a canyon, you start downhill. You do the first rappel, pull your rope, and if you can't deal with what's in front of you, you're screwed. - There are lots and lots of problems in canyons. Pools of water that may or may not be over your head. Mud, log jams. So you need to be ready for whatever you might run into. And canyons teach you quite quickly, if they're hard enough, and if they're long enough, if it's mean enough, just what you're up for. - We live in this society where we're stuck in an office somewhere, behind a computer or something, and for some people, they want some challenge. It gives the readers a chance to enjoy something new and in this world we live in now, we're always looking for something to do on weekends. - Currently there's a lot of people that haven't developed an outdoors sense. There's a lot of us that were raised in the outdoors. We've got parents that like camping, hiking, hunting, fishing, whatever. But there's people now that are going from the sofa to the canyon. And if something goes wrong, they can't find that thing inside them to be able to deal effectively with the situation. - We knew that people would get into canyons and get in trouble. We knew it was coming. It was inevitable and it was not that hard to see down the road what was gonna happen. - Most of us that say we want adventure are secretly hoping we don't find it. - Hmm. Well, I thought it would be a little easier to find. They said it would be difficult to find in the dark, but it's still light , what does that say? There is dirt road going up there. Looked pretty chunky. I'm not sure where I'm going . Ah. I think it's time to look at the map. Is this the right weekend? - Encouraged by his father to enjoy the outdoors, Steve's childhood was immersed in hiking, fishing and camping. Even into adulthood, when Steve had exhausted his local trails, his father guided him into an entirely new kind of adventure. - I gotta read the directions on how to use this thing. - Exploring canyons that were just a stone's throw from the hiking trails they had explored throughout their lives, Steve and his father rekindled the thrill of local adventure. - It was a whole new adventure, seeing all these waterfalls that are so close to the hiking trails. It was quite an exciting experience for us. - There's so much to see out there. There are waterfalls that are a hundred feet high and would have never known that they were there without being introduced to canyoneering and knowing how to rappel off of those waterfalls. - When we first started, it was a little bit of a sense of both awe and fear, but we managed to make it through all right. - Being told to just trust the gear and that moment of standing on solid rock, the next thing you know you're legs are dangling in the air. Should you be doing this? Is it safe? That's where the thrill comes in. To overcome that barrier, to put yourself out there. It's a lot of fun. A little chilly last night. Had to put some fleece on. I am really wondering what the Facebook site says on how many people are coming now. I'm thinking the rain may have turned people around, changed their minds. - Steve's introduction to canyon thrills had gotten off to a shaky start when in 2003, during their annual trip to Zion National Park, his father had stumbled on a brochure with directions to a remote canyon. - We didn't know anything about it and we were quite ill-prepared for what was about to come about. - We knew that there would be various places to scramble over small waterfalls, but at that point, we really didn't know that that was considered canyoneering. We tried so hard to keep everything dry. We took a length of rope so we could string our packs, shuttle them across the pools. We probably looked ridiculous. - I got so cold at one period of time, I had to take off my cotton t-shirt and put it in my backpack. I mean it was warmer without any shirt on at all. - Despite the awkward start, Steve and his father have garnered enough interest to devote their free time in pursuit of their newfound hobby. - Well, it wasn't pretty. - But without climbing experience, developing the necessary skills would become a lasting endeavor. - Just don't pull yourself up too hard and knock your head . After completing that canyon, we realized that we needed to develop more technique. - Learn a little more about the technical aspects of going through a canyon. - We knew that we would want to graduate to other canyons. - You okay? - We realized that we need to get some training. - Okay, bring your hands out from behind you. Okay, right here you can lean forward, put your hands on my shoulders. Watch that rock down there. Okay. Lean forward. - Offering a unique curriculum of canyoneering technique and safety, Rich's course is filled with students eager to try the sport. - Jumps over the log, runs around the back side of the tree. - But following the success of his classes, it was another innovation that stirred the fledgling community. - One of the first things that ACA accomplished was a development of a rating system. The first component is numeric. It goes one, two, three, and four, and that's related to the difficulty of the terrain or the rope work involved. A class one canyon is a canyon hike. A class two canyon should be considered maybe an intermediate canyon. It's got some scrambling involved. Class three canyons are canyons that involve rappelling. And a class four canyon is something that will have, let's just call it an advanced or expert canyon. The second component is an alpha character, A, B, or C. A is a primarily dry canyon. A class B canyon is one that's got water but basically no current. And class C canyon is a canyon that's got flowing water in it. - The ACA rating system was accepted instantly as the standard in canyoneering. Even Mike, recognizing it's significance, included it in his latest guidebook. Published in 2003, the Tehcnical Slot Canyon Guide responded to a growing need for adventure including only canyons that require rope to traverse. With each canyon listing a rating, readers could choose an undertaking based on a desired level of challenge. - Your rope comes up out of the rope bag, passes through the rappel ring, and you set your rope length. When people get into canyoneering, they're after two kinds of information. One kind of information is what technical skills do I need and another set of information they need is where are the canyons. Part of our American way of doing things is "Point me in the right direction, I'll figure it out." Of course, I feel like the technical information is the more important of the two. You should get the technical skills before you go looking for canyons. - Look good there. This thing should be warm. This is the old fashioned way. Wax the back, cut and paste. But it works damn good for me, so I don't care. People probably think I'm funny as hell using this old method, but I can do these about as fast as you can on a computer. Cut that off. That's the one of size I want right there. In this country, there's a lot of Cedar Mesa. Sandstone. Let's see this one now. Should be big enough. Right now my biggest problem is space. Space in my store room for books. Because neither of these books will be great sellers. This was here years ago, while my mother was here and we rented the top part out, I closed it off and made a separate apartment here. Now, this is a mess. This is my old office right there and everything's filled up. This is typical bachelor, I guess. This is where I lived for 20 years in this little apartment here, plus the office. Now, I got some books down here now. It's kind of an extra bedroom if I want it. So what I'm gonna have to do is just to forget about having a guest bedroom, I guess, and take this bed out of here and stack more books in here. Most heroic author of all. The author, that's, I use that, if you will, is of course, the great man you so viciously malign in your slimy article, Mark Kelsey. I don't know what. I think this was the black hole. He said, hell, nobody used to go down there. Now I went past there on Memorial Day or one of those weekends and there was 13 cars stacked up there, parked there with everybody going down there. Slot canyons are his, that's the note I made on the outside. The slots are so small that it doesn't take much to ruin them. I've seen a lot of them in the last few years and the results are sickening. Anyway. - When I did my first attempt on Edge of the Earth canyon, I told everyone, you are not to tell anybody that you ever went here. What we really wanted was a canyon that hadn't been descended that maybe we were the first people to ever see, and that we'd be pretty seriously sure of not seeing anybody else. When you're talking about a canyon called Edge of the Earth, it's not on any map and no one is gonna know what you're talking about. We knew early on that eventually people were going to find out how fun running through canyons and rappelling through pools and overcoming the challenges and seeing the beauty of these canyons, it was going to become popular. But we weren't gonna hurry it along. - It looks like a storm in the water. I knew that there was so much more out there and finding what was online and eventually picking up guidebooks. There was a drive to want to see it firsthand. I've seen the local canyons so much, I've barely touched on what's in Utah. The slot canyons, it's nice when you get into somewhere you have to squeeze to get through them. I think that's unlike what we have in LA. Knowing how tight these canyons can get, it just adds a different element of excitement. - While exploring, Utah's narrowest slot canyons, Steve's scrambling brought him further into unknown territory. - All right, woo. That's a hard start to the morning. - Using the opposing walls for support, he had discovered stemming, a climbing technique crucial to traversing tight canyons. Inadvertently, Steve had stumbled into advanced canyon terrain. - Initially, we weren't that far off the deck and we just kept moving along and it did get to a point where it may have been 30 feet or so off the deck. I'd never done anything like that. I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I'm getting a little off here, I don't really like. Anybody in the party were to slip, it's not like it's going to kill you, but you're certainly gonna get yourself stuck in there and be trapped. Wow. Getting down and just dropping into the sand, it was a relief that that canyon was over. That was hair raising . But you look back at it and you go, that was a good kind of scary because I had a great time. It's not something my father's going to do or even some, a few people in my circle of canyoneering friends, I don't think it's something that they would want to do. Knowing that I got through that canyon without much difficulty, you'll think what other canyons are out there that have that element of excitement in them. Check out some other canyons of greater difficulty. - Now, with your right foot, go ahead and move it down to that shelf that's six inches below. Nope, just down. Just down. There you go. Almost, okay. Now, if you switch your left hand back to that position, is that comfortable? - Um, nope. - Okay. Left hand right here on this ledge. - Why? - Right hand on that ledge. - Why? - Drop down maybe a foot and a half. - Put your left hand here. - I could actually walk down. - Okay. Then you're good. - Okay. I did some pretty dumb things when I was a young rock climber. I see people now doing some of the same dumb things I did. You're right handed, your right hand should be on the break strand. And I'd rather see you leaning up against the rock or sitting, brace yourself, be secure. It's like having a kid and saying "Son, I've been there, I've done that. "You don't have to go through the same stupid things. "Let me help you pass that just with a conversation." You kids don't listen, do ya? And I don't expect very many people that are coming up the ranks in climbing and canyoneering to listen either. They need to learn it on their own. And with the tail, let's go ahead and start with about 2.5, three inches of tail. Now, stick your finger inside of that girth hitch. You'll be happier if you're using a finger instead of a thumb, though. - Okay. - Take the end piece off, put that piece on, and then the end piece back again. - I got the first there. Op, now I gotta start all over again. - What the ACA teaches is a set of skills that I refer to as tools in the toolbox. But does everybody have something that generally looks like this? - Starting over. - Rip here. - Hard skills are here, here's how you tie this knot. Here's how you rig this rope. Here's how you set up an anchor. Soft skills are things like common sense and judgment and those aren't as easy to teach. And I mentioned in the classroom this morning that that's the way I always teach it, but then I see students in panic mode that just go like this, and it's okay. It works. Here's the tools in your toolbox. We hope we've given you enough information to point you in the right direction as to which skills are appropriate in which kinds of situations, but until that person is standing out there by themselves on the top of a cliff and making the decision for themselves, who knows. - As the main canyons have been done, everybody knows how to get through these now once a guidebook comes out. Then you're always looking for more and the natural evolution there is that some of these are getting more difficult and more dangerous. In case we have to go back up this canyon, we'll know where to turn. Whoa. Look what we have here. These are bear tracks. Three little toes right there. How on Earth are they getting into this canyon now? Everybody wants to be the first man to reach the top of Everest and every person, every canyoneer wants to be the first one to make the descent of such and such canyon. 11 a.m. at first slot of big drops. I think we can climb up there if we have to. This looks like a swimmer, right here. Could get up there and walk on the bench for a ways. I think we're running out of room here. Yeah. Well, there's trees and more water. We'll go back and get up on the bench and it looks like there's a two anchors, two maybe. One thing I enjoy is being the first to make it public and put it on a map. I enjoy that. I consider myself, I guess, in that small group of people who enjoy being the first to go down because there is that danger and we don't know what the hell's down there. We got a tree over there. We can anchor it by. I see some places we can build an anchor or something. That looks like we're in business. Whoa, little steep right here. Maybe we can just. Little bit scary. Just, you know, two or three quick hops and you're over there. Getting a little past my comfort level here. I don't like this. Perfect. Whoa. Got a little tree over there, so that's good news. Uh, we don't have any anchors down below here. So I think we're gonna have to just one big rappel down to there and then I think we can just get bench walk over there. That's what it kind of looks like. But we're gonna have to do something up here. We might have to use this little rope to go back from the rim on this tree and then have it come over. That's what I'm thinking right now. Oh, hell. Hell, look. We're not the first . - As the number of canyoneers continued to rise, even the most remote corners of wilderness show evidence of visitors. - Back in Pine Creek days, I didn't think that it would become what it has. I thought that it would eventually become popular. It was just too cool. Edge of the Earth has a very distinctive pour over, which we call the Monster pour over. And that image is now on the side of a U-Haul van. I cannot tell you what my feelings were like on the day that I first saw that image. I used to say in the '80s even, I'm gonna take you to a canyon, we're gonna go down there on Labor Day weekend and we're not gonna see a soul for five days. I would have a hard time doing that now and that's what I miss. These people, they think that canyoneering began when they discovered it on the internet. And that canyoneering wouldn't even be possible without the internet. And I came up with a term for these people. I had to, and I decided to call them canyonista. They're not climbers. They don't have the background. They get hyped up about the gear and about the notoriety of canyons, especially when a guidebook says this canyon is for tough guys only. - Okay, you guys ready? Hey, are you okay? - There's no reason anyone should break their leg on a rappel. A rappel is an infinitely safe thing. You have to be a complete idiot to break your leg on a rappel. - Oh, shit, Matt. Holy shit. - I'm rolling, whoa, whoa. - In canyoneering, a lot of people come up with ideas for techniques. One person will look at it and they'll say, wow, that's a really cool technique. Other people will look at it and they say "Holy crap, that's dangerous." Canyoneering above all should be fun. My biggest concern would be when somebody else looks at that video what is their perception. If somebody looks at it and laughs but inside, they're thinking, "Man, that guy was lucky." Okay. If somebody is looking at it and thinking, "Here, hold my beer, let me give it a try." Then it's a problem. - These are the people, a lot of people, that are going down canyons today. That's not good for the rest of us. And it's not good for canyons. It's not good for government agencies that have to rescue them. It's just kind of spiraling out of control. - Wow. Holy shit. I turned around the camera. - Good morning. What are your plans, man? - Probably heading back to town. - You thinking about coming up tonight or tomorrow or basically calling it quits? - Tomorrow I've gotta go get some stuff done at my work. - What are your plans, man? - I think I'm gonna go home. - What's your plan? - I don't know, not feeling so well. - What's your plans, man? - I think it's gonna be a day off or do something short. - Some people are calling it quits and going home early. - . - Rendezvous are not guided events. They're an opportunity for self-reliant canyoneers to get together with other self-reliant canyoneers. So, folks, we're doing really well. It's40 and people are showing up for our eight o'clock departure. And when you tell everybody they're equally responsible, they all become cats and nobody's able to hurt them. - So guys, this brings up a good point. We're already running late. So, I think let's make some decisions. Are we all one group? Are we two group, and what's our plan of attack? Who's in the top down, playing around? So, pretty much we're one group. - I'm comfortable that we can move quickly enough. - I'm not. - And finish with headlamps. - I have done it. I'm not confident. Playing through is always a challenge. We're just gonna have to be efficient. We're gonna have to be better at being efficient. - Okay, let's go. - And when it's all over, I look back on it and take a deep breath, heavy sigh. - With attendees assembled from all over the U.S., Rich's Arizona rendezvous was geared for a successful week. But those who couldn't make it to the event had to find adventure closer to home. - Woohoohoo. - Yeah. - That's a hoohoo. - Going deep now. Oh, in the beginning, it was amazing how many times we could do the same canyon over and over again. Being that their local, it's just an hour drive away, I've probably been through Little Santa Anita 30 times, perhaps. - Woohoo, got me down in the woohoo again. - I think I tired on doing the same, same canyons. Yeah, you definitely wanted to graduate to something a little bit bigger. A bigger rappel, just to have different challenges. Certainly getting into canyons where it is necessary to build your own anchors. It's not gonna just be clip onto a bolt and go. - With a steady regiment of home base canyoneering, Steve's desire for more exotic adventures was mounting. But until his next trip to Utah, he would have to settle for local terrain. So desperate was his quest for thrills, Steve was primed for any opportunity, even recognizing his chance after floodwaters had set off a landslide into his canyon. - I remember last time we were here, there was a bunch of boulders that needed to be moved. That's why I thought this would work. - With his favorite rappel section buried under rocks and debris, Steve sees the challenge to restore the canyon to original condition. - I think the key stone to move is right there. - It probably weighs 500 pounds. - You know how much fun that was to go down this channel, then walk underneath the chalk stone and come out. There was a pool underneath. We had some movement! - I was a little concerned, particularly when Steve climbed underneath that big rock and were dislodging these very large boulders that were probably anywhere from 100 to 500 pound. It was a little exciting and a little disconcerting. I was more worried about him. - Look at that, look at it go. There she blows. - Initially we started to move beyond what we would consider simple canyons and do some more difficult canyons. I moved up the ladder to a certain level and a certain comfort zone, and he went beyond that and move into areas that he was comfortable in doing, but I wasn't. As you explore more and more of these, you really need to leave off at that one rung and let the people who are more equipped to climb to the next rung continue on. - There was an element that you want to move on into more difficult canyons that require more skills. I think everybody who has the sense of adventure in the outdoors, always wants to challenge themselves. You feel that you have what it takes, and to get out there and actually do it, it's exciting to find out what you're made of. What you can overcome. - My hat was off to him and he was very comfortable in starting to do some of the more difficult canyons. I was happy to see that as long as he was doing things safely. - As we started doing bigger and nastier canyons, we started thinking about it very intellectually. What kinds of problems could we run into down here? What if you get too cold? What if your pack self-destructs? What if your rope is cut? Any of these things could happen. - On one end of the spectrum, you have things like somebody's t-shirt got stuck in their rappelling device. It's not life threatening, it just is a problem that needs to be addressed in some way. And then on the other end of the spectrum, you've got things like, what if I go out into a canyon all by myself and pull a rock down on top of my arm. - So I, and the boulder smashed my left hand here. - We were in constant fear of running out of bolts or having a rope chopped from rockfall and so we started inventing ways of dealing with these problems. Climbers used bat hooks for a long time and simply that they were little c-shaped hooks. You were able to engineer your way up the rock without placing a number of bolts, simply by climbing up the little holes. It would also be a way of climbing out of canyons if we ever got stuck by bad weather or injury or something else. Later on, as the years went by, there were a number of people that died because they hadn't been thoughtful enough to figure out some of these what if questions. - Hm, 640, the same shutter speed. Let's see, hold it, there's a thing here. May 26, 2011, that's not long ago. This hike is doable for experienced hikers. The water level was very low, which added considerable difficulty. Hmm. Easy route back out of the canyon is through a, is tough to navigate. We had to do it in the dark. Well, with some scrambling. No kidding. Allow six to eight hours for this hike. Six to eight hours. I've never done it in less than five. It's always been about five for me. I have no idea who would have taken that long. Let's read more. Well, well, a 57 year old lady made it through with some help. Six to eight hours. Well, it's a 57 year old lady that's never exercised in her life. But maybe it was tough. Anyway. Oh, let's see. So we're, say,51. I'm gonna write this thing down. But if they'd spent some money on it like the CCCs did back in the '30s when they made all these other trails, then it would last a long time. So, anyway, here's that other sign. So, well, it's exactly the same sign as up above, but they're just saying do not descend the Black Hole. That's ridiculous. Just only well-prepared people should do it, or something. This is a little bit of overkill. I guess they're trying to save themselves from having to come out here and rescue people and I don't know how many times they've had to do that. That one girl from Alpine or American Fork or somewhere up in northern Utah, you know, she got drowned. They had a big flood, a big storm up near Bridges National Monument and that was on a Friday, Friday afternoon, I suppose, and then they came in here Saturday morning and the flood came about eight o'clock as I recall and it caught them right in the worst possible place that they could be for a flood and they lost one girl, a teenage girl. That's what this is all about. They're afraid people are gonna come down, the ill-prepared people are gonna come down here and attempt it and then they'll have to drag them out. So, anyway. - It was supposed to be a five day adventure of a lifetime. David Fleischer and Kim Ellis helped lead a group of teenage hikers from Salt Lake City down into one of Zion's most treacherous narrow canyons. - A foreboding canyon, Kolob Creek had first been explored by Dennis and his friends in 1978. They couldn't have known at the time, but their canyon would become the setting of tragedy when 15 years later, a boy scout group attempted the same descent. - When they did that first rappel, they're in water that is normally one inch to two inches deep. It was so swift right there that they could hardly keep their footing. I'm out of there. Right then, this is obviously too much water. - With excess water arriving from a nearby reservoir, the group found the canyon in unusual form. - Can you describe what that should look like if it were safe? - You wouldn't hear any noise. You'd hear a nice babbling little brook, and a little trickle of water going through there. - I can understand, okay, well, why don't we just go down a couple little drops and see what it's like and maybe leave rope someplace, but they didn't do that. They just went for it. - At that point in time, they should have been giving it a lot more thought and made a decision that maybe we're not aware of what conditions we're gonna face downstream. - Rappelling into turbulent water, group leader David Fleischer was caught in a whirlpool while still connected to the rope. In a brave, hasty effort to rescue his partner, Kim Ellis jumped into the pool, but in the chaos, Ellis hit his head on the rock wall and disappeared under water. - The decision should have been made right then. Let's get out of this canyon. To try and continue and then turn around and lose a second person was unnecessary. - Believing it was too difficult to retreat up canyon, a rattled Fleischer ordered the group to proceed. But less than a hundred feet from where Ellis had vanished and while descending into another churning pool, Fleischer was again pulled into the powerful hydraulics. - David Fleischer and Kim Ellis both drowned in raging waters. The six survivors could only wait and hope for rescue. - He just wanted to take the kids down that canyon so bad that he completely forgot who he was and where they were. - It's unfortunate that a couple people lost there lives. It's especially unfortunate because it didn't have to happen. There were some errors in judgment made. - Just as Zion had been grounds to the first influx of canyoneers, the park would also witness a steady increase in accidents. In response, park managers went to work in developing sophisticated rescue procedures focused on extracting victims from inaccessible canyons. And with an average of 60 backcountry rescues each summer, the national park had plenty of chances to perfect their skills. - Of course we want to be good at what we do, and so we want to be good at search and rescue. We want to improve the high angle techniques that we can use. We wanna improve our emergency medical skills. So I do feel like we've got an advanced, highly competent search and rescue team in the park but that's not really the message we wanna get across. If you get hurt in one of the slot canyons, you're gonna be there for a while and we'd rather people recognize that than feel like there's a highly competent rescue team in Zion and that I can go push my limits and those guys will go get me if something bad happens. I believe strongly in the concept of wilderness and part of that concept of wilderness is the idea that when people go out, we have to make good decisions, and if we don't, we're gonna pay for those. We want people to be ready to solve problems for themselves. We want people to be ready to take care of themselves and we definitely don't want people to feel like somebody's gonna take care of them if they make mistakes. I hope that people continue to look for more tools in their toolbox, more ability to solve problems on their own, and I also hope that people continue to understand that Zion is more than simply an outdoor playground. It's a national park, it's a wilderness. - So you guys all know this isn't a guided trip. We're all responsible for ourselves and each other, right? I think an important part of my job is to facilitate experiences, not to be the boss, and to encourage other people to become self-reliant canyoneers. If my goal is to step back and let them solve the problems and let them make the decisions, I start getting a little nervous if it's a large group. - Okay, someones off on that, so go ahead, next person. - On rappel. - Okay, rope. - All right, who ever is next. - I do have high expectations from former students. I am confident that I give them a solid skill set for their toolbox. Off rope. - Okay. - Thank you, Steve. - Just seeing people that are willing to step up and accept some responsibility and not wait for somebody else to do what needs to be done, pretty proud of the guys that I trained that stepped up to the plate. - Off rope. - Off rope. - Hey, Quint. You two and two more? - Yeah. - Once things started moving smoothly it was nice to just sit back and be one of the crew going through a canyon. Demonstrating competency throughout the canyon, Rich and his team were rewarded with a thrilling finale. - Six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11. - It's your reflection in the window there. It looks like there's someone else. - You coming up with 11 like I am? - Now I can take my wetsuit off. - But put your hiking boots on in case we have go looking for Walt. Walt is missing. - What? We thought Walt was with you guys. Oh, was Walt with us? - No. - From where I was, I could see where he was going and I said, "Walt, it's not gonna work." And he said, "Oh, don't worry about it. "I'll go up to the top of the ridge." So he went. The problem with somebody taking off on their own and not telling the group what they're doing is they leave the rest of the group in a position where they've gotta guess what's going on. And right now it would be really nice to believe that he's still in that creek bed heading that way. Because he kept asking me what direction is my truck from here. And I pointed, I said, but you don't wanna go that way. He could have got cliffed out, slipped and fell. He could be hurt out there bleeding somewhere, and we have no idea where the hell he is. - Structure. - Come on. Find a hold. - There's a protocol for the lost person. The protocol is to sit down and let yourself be found. Of course, not all people know that they're lost. If you know what the person is doing, you can come up with a plan. But we had no idea what he was up to. It's a very helpless feeling. - There are a select few places we'd be able to pick him up at so we're just gonna have to hope for that. - Oh my gosh. - Did you see my flashing headlamp over there? - Walt, we are happy to see you. - I figured you were either happy or you were gonna ditch me. - No, we did wait a considerable amount of time. - Well. - Hey, well let's. - I owe you all a nice dinner for that. - No, no, no, you're fine. - No, I'm not fine. I screwed up . - I was thinking , we just dodged a bullet. There was an extreme amount of luck involved in that. Part of me was relieved, I was happy to see him, happy to see him safe. Another part of me wanted to kick his ass. - Jigger huh? - Okay. - No, I'm still pissed at him. - Well, I. Following the success of his first technical guide, Mike set out to create a second volume. Hoping to include new offerings in the updated book, he turned to more challenging canyons. - In the last, well, three or four years, I was continuing to get to do more difficult canyons and maybe I've got too many difficult canyons in that edition. It would be nice to be the first to get through this thing. That's what everybody wants to do. They want to be the first descent or something. It took a while to get down, didn't it? - Mike's opportunity for challenge arrived in the form of high stemming. Too narrow at the bottom for passage, v-shaped canyons force the canyoneer high off the ground and where a climber might place protection from a fall, smooth canyon walls offer little support. As Mike's adventures reach new heights, so do the consequences. - The extreme now of course is X slot canyons. That's definitely life-threatening there. - The X and the R are actually part of kind of an off the wall rock climbing rating. And it basically boils down to the risk involved in the canyon. The X canyon might have some difficult exposed rock climbing. It might be a canyon that's got very long sections of commitment. You do a rappel, pull your rope, and you have no choice but to finish the canyon. - In 2008, Mike's updated version of his Technical Canyoneering guide had included over a dozen R and X rated canyons. - There's people who want to extend the adventure of going through these canyons and those are the only ones who are gonna even attempt R or X rated canyons. I guess that's the reason I added it, for those who want to go as far as they possibly can. That's hitting the limit for most people, the absolute limit. - One person could make an argument that they shouldn't be published at all to keep people away from them. Other people will say, yeah, but sooner or later people are gonna hear about 'em, so we're doing the community a service if we do publish them and make it very clear that these are difficult, high risk canyons. - And hopefully they'll have the sense to work their way up, start out with just simple rappelling and simple slots and then work up to the point where you're doing a lot of chimney work. - I think there is a fair warning as long as people in fact understand the rating system and more importantly, they've actually done an honest assessment of their own skills. Some people do a couple of easy canyons and say, "Okay, what's next?" and they wanna jump into something big. They need to pay more dues before they jump into the big ones. - Okay, let me think about this just for a second. - With a growing resume of canyon descents, Steve progressed into more serious endeavors. And expanding on a knowledge base gained from early canyoneering classes, he sharpened his skills under the guidance of experienced partners. - Thank you. - When you're the belayer at the bottom. - Yeah. - You want to keep your arms locked so you walk your arms up. Pushing into the wall. - Pushing into the wall. - Now you can bend. - So, just sliding my hands up the body. Just uh. - Yeah, you work them up. - Work em up. Okay, not sliding . - Don't pull, push. You were pulling me down. - Oh okay . - Oh yeah, very nice. - I've got it. - Poifect. - I'm not doing that. - As part of a team, difficult canyons were traversed with ease and efficiency. But as Steve advanced into more hazardous ratings, the biggest challenge still eluded him. - The walls are low at this point, marked at 1265 meters on the map. So climb left or north up a little ridge. Once on top, route find northeast to where you can overlook the lower end of Middle Fork. Planning for an X canyon, I think initially there's, there's some anxiety as to what am I getting myself into. You immediately have to wrap while the canyon tightens up and you'll start your high stemming up to about 10 meters or so. Certainly in a canyon that requires high stemming, you're putting a lot on the line. You have to have the skills to do it. If you don't, then you're in the wrong canyon. Knowing what you're getting yourself into I think is very important. Knowing that it's something that you're going to be comfortable with 'cause you are committing yourself to the canyon and you have to complete. Safely. - As far as evolving from just walk through canyons to the X slots, I mean, it's just natural progression. You're looking for new adventure. Everybody's looking for new adventure. So it's just natural progression from walking up to the X slots. So yeah, my readers come along with me, I'm sure. We got about halfway through the canyon and had to turn back. Just down a bit is where it slots up again and that's the middle slot. It's an XX slot. So it's a good one. Anyway, we went down there and had to come back out. On the right hand side of that wall there is what we climbed up. And right now, I'd hate to go back and do it again. It looks pretty tough to me. Okay. I think about where it turns there is where it starts to get pretty nasty looking. - A dark, menacing fracture. Scorpion West was listed in his guidebook as the most difficult canyon the author had ever seen. - And I was down climbing one piece without the helmet. None of us had helmets on because we were just getting into the difficult spot and I slipped and fell. I fell on my pack, but my head hit the rock behind or something. It wasn't very far, you know, and it was bleeding like a dolt, but nobody took my picture then. - High off the ground, the group encountered green moss covering the walls. Without the friction of the sandstone, the already treacherous adventure had become deadly. - I think we were getting exhausted. You know, this was a hot summer and we were getting tired at that point and decided it was too much for us now. - Fatigued from hours of relentless high stemming, Mike and his group turned back. In his book, Mike deemed the canyon impossible without the aid of climbing hardware. It was his first incomplete canyon. - Well, I don't really have any animosity or whatever toward the canyon. We just didn't make it and that's it. Don't cry over spilt milk or whatever they say. But, I mean, I started getting up close to 60 when I was doing this for the first time, so it pays, with something this difficult, it pays to be young and a little stupid like I was when I was a younger, mountain-climbing, big glaciers, big crevasses, going alone. Kind of stupid. You gotta retire sooner or later from some of this difficult stuff. I'd rather live to die of old age than in the bottom of one of these, frankly. - He's starting to reach his limit of what he can do comfortably and safely and I think he recognizes it which is great. My concern goes up as the ratings go up, but I know he's fully capable of these. But there's always the risk factor that goes up. You have to, again, be comfortable in what you're doing, and at some point, you have to realize that maybe you shouldn't be doing it and maybe that's why they call it Don't Do It. - A long ways down. Having an idea what an X canyon is and the stemming, it's certainly, it woke me up at night more than once. What am I gonna be doing, risking great injury if I were to fail. I'm feeling good, absolutely. I think there's some nesting birds that live right there. It looks tight. It's lots of, right away, gee, that's like a foot wide down there. Crazy. - Dude, that whole thing is moving. - Is it really? Oh, I don't like that at all. Oh, poop. I saw it move. That pack is heavy. What if something happens that's not going your way? What if someone tires and can't proceed? What if part of your two, if someone were to fall, what do you do? You hope that, well, you're planning, you're planning that you have a strong team and there's not gonna be any of those what ifs. All right. Wow, it really, the bottom did drop away. I would say we're probably 50 feet up. It's hard to get a clear picture of the bottom. I'm gonna say that's 50. Now I'm forced to go down just a little bit. We're getting a little mossy. It's not wet, but certainly below me looks moist, but this part right here is not. I think it needs a little water to come back to life. I gotta get up higher. Don't wanna rely on that handhold. Got a charlie horse . I'm getting a workout here. Elbows are starting to feel abraded. This section's, I think you can actually see further to the bottom and maybe it's a little psychological as well. I think at some point it crosses over from less fun to more challenge and I enjoy the challenge so you can keep developing your skills, but I think the fun has diminished. Up here at the turn, it looks like it's a wider bottom, it looks like I can make out a little bit of a sand on the bottom and maybe some grass. So, hopefully we'll be walking for a little bit and move forward. Get off the stemming here for a little bit and let our bodies recuperate. Or I see now, I guess I really didn't see the bottom. I thought I did. Maybe I was fantasizing but now I can look out there and see that golden wall, so I suspect we should be walking at that point. Whew. I think we're gonna be walking here in another 30 yards. The canyon did not relent. I guess, I'm just gonna wait until I see what it is for sure because I thought it was opening up but it's still very tight. Here we are at the end of the stemming section, the long section that Kelsey describes as an hour and a half of stemming. And at this point here is a way to exit if you don't want to continue on with more stemming. Certainly people can get out here and walk back. So that's where we are and we're just gonna continue on. Oof. - Don't Do It delivered everything the guide book had promised. An unrelenting testing ground where a careless move would be deadly. After hours of continuous high stemming at heights up to 60 feet above the canyon floor, Steve found his ultimate adventure. - It was long day. It was an early start. It was a lot of fun and the challenges, I think that defines an adventure. The risk is part of the excitement. It certainly is for me. - Only a short distance from the final rappel, Steve would soon add Don't Do It to his list of accomplishments. - Well, we just had a cloud move overhead and we're getting a very light drizzle on us right now. A little drizzle's not gonna be a problem. It would be nice to get out of the tight section. It's pretty tight right there. The walls are getting slippery here. - Steve! Steve! - You do kind of climb the ladder as you continue on and do perhaps more challenging canyons. When you start to feel more comfortable with that last rung, you move onto another one because you tend to look for more, I don't know whether it's challenging or more beautiful places to go. But we look for the beauty that's out there and sometimes that beauty comes in places where there is some degree of risk. You just hope you can manage that risk and continue on and find that beauty. - I can still put weight on it. I just took a little slip right here when a rock broke loose and it kind of made my shoulder hurt a little bit but I still have good mobility in it. Oh, gotta keep pulling it really hard. It caught me totally off guard that my foot was gonna slip and it was quite a scare. All you could to was grasp at things to do your best to stop. Fortunately I did. There's not much more stemming but that's not gonna help the stemming any. It may have been 40 feet still off the deck there. I was fortunate that it wasn't worse than it was. - A few years ago I did feel a responsibility as the guy that started the ACA, as the guy that was training other instructors and so on and so on. I felt like pulling my hair out at times. Thinking like why isn't this message sinking in? - Get and length and width out of there. - But I'm at the point now, maybe I'm just older, wiser, more patient, whatever. I just know people are gonna be people and some people you can teach, some people need to learn it the hard way. Some people are gonna get hurt. Some people are gonna die, but you can't help everybody. - Well, that's where I wanted it. That just went on and on. That was just relentless. I'm tired. My arm feels better now after my fall, like maybe the ibuprofen kicked in. I've done it. I'm glad I did it. Not likely I'll come back and do it again. Good time to pack it up and get outta here. I'm a little cold now. - If you don't want to be thought of as a canyonista, you really need to increase your skillset so that you can make decisions on your own and so you can get yourself safely through a canyon on your own, whatever it might throw at you. You don't have to have Canyon Beta. You don't have to read guidebooks. If you want, really, to be a gorger in the true sense of the old term, you wanna go down there blind and just react to what happens and do it well. That's gorging. Dark slide. Now we wait for people to be gone. This could take a while. There are too many canyoneers. There are too few canyons. Go, go, keep walking. Keep walking . That's really the bottom line for me is I'd like these canyons to remain the way they were when I saw them first, and that's impossible. Except a couple of canyons that they haven't found yet and I'll be damned if I'll tell them where they are.
