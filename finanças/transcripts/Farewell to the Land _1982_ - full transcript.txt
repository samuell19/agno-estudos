You never did anything for me! You bastards are all against me! You hate me! Want me to die? No one wants you to die, son. - That's right. - Shut up! Go on! Kill me! You're imagining things, Yukio. No, Uncle Take. My parents love my younger brother, not me. He left here to lead his own life. Yet I stayed to work for this house. I supported them. I slaved for them. Was all this just because of his brother in Tokyo? No. He started complaining about the food. Didn't like the beans. He said I sent all the good food to his brother in Tokyo. Without me, you'd have starved long ago. Kill me! He's impossible. I'm going home. I'm very sorry. Well, all the best. What are you saying? How's your daughter? She has written me once, so far away and all. Went to the Wakayama foundry with her husband, didn't she? She doesn't care about me anymore. It's tough for a man to live alone. Well, I'll move the rig. Hello. Looks like rain, doesn't it. The weather gods must be jealous of you. You're kind to your wife. I wish I'd married a man like you. You're here. Come in. I couldn't get to the senior citizen's party today. It's my arthritis. They sent something. Seen the doctor? I hate doctors. Welcome. Don't bother, Fumie. You're pregnant, you know. She's young, doesn't hear well though. Fumie! What is it? Where are the boys? They must be playing outdoors. Don't bother about us. We'll die soon enough. Men can get along with their daughters-in-law. Women can't. My daughters-in-law and I aren't speaking. Still mad? Not talking is tiring. Don't talk to her until she tries to make up. Make her talk to you. But, my son is on her side. He doesn't talk to me, either. Even your own child. Sons are all the same. Well, we won't live long. Let's at least die proudly. Just don't give in to her. Let's sing to forget our worries. Yes, let's. A frog is crying on a dead tree... It's your fault that they're dead! You killed them! Over here! Akihiko, God sure is cruel. Took both your nephews at the same time. I don't trust Him. Never will. Come on, let's do it again. You're lucky. Kobayashi, beat her! Akihiko, it's really tough, isn't it? When are you going back to Tokyo? Tomorrow. You work here every day? Sometimes. Thanks. Doesn't country life bore you? Come to Tokyo. But, my mom... Akihiko, don't go tempting my daughter. You used to be her boyfriend, but that's a thing of the past, isn't it? I asked if she's bored here. Childhood sweethearts. She's a good girl. Whoever her father is. Business is good in this town. I'll find a rich husband for her. Mom... Sake. You shouldn't. One more. Akihiko, don't worry about me. Go back to Tokyo. Let's drink to his children. He said: "I'm carrying my children on my back. I'm suffering... "But you aren't," he said. But I am suffering. He just doesn't know. He got drunk and tore up the children's altar. You're going to have the baby here? What? What will you do about it? He kicks me in the stomach, tells me to go back home. That bastard. I'll help you. Never mind. Think of the baby. I have. I'm exhausted. Visit our parents' graves and ask them what to do. What festival are these for? Nishibori City. They got so much money now, they can get all new stuff. He's more crazy this time. His eyes scare me. Time will fix it. Just be patient. When you're married, your husband's home is yours. Can I have a chicken to take home? Sure. Take one. If you can't stand it, you can come back anytime. I'll try my best. I'll give you a lift. Get in. The view's great from up here. The best. No wonder truckers act so proud. They're stupid. That's not true. Even I feel proud, sitting up so high. You think you're like kings. We look down on everyone. Was that a love letter you were reading? No, a note my mom left. She ran away with a younger man. That guy in his thirties named Kobayashi? He's just a municipal clerk. Finally I'm all alone. She'll come back soon. It's her third time. The first time was when I was six. We lived in Yokohama. She ran away and didn't come back for a week. I ate everything in the house in the first two days. Didn't have any money either. So I just drank water, after that. I decided to starve to death. I wish I had. You hate her? I'm the only child. I was intending to take care of her till she died. I don't have to get married. Go on back to my younger brother. That's not funny. We're through. Then come with me. Don't joke around. You've got a wife. She's gone. I don't understand her. I married her out of pity, but she seems to have forgotten that. Hello, Battleship Yamato. How come you got that juicy little cherry? Couldn't you spare me a piece of cherry pie? Understood. It's right from the family orchard. So you'll have to do without it. Return to your den and eat your own. Over. - Understood. - What did that mean? "How come you got that pretty girl? "Why don't you introduce me to her?" And what was your answer? "She's in the family, so forget it." How about a drive? I'd like to see some places. Must be real tough. About my kids? I'm sorry. Wanna see something? Wow. What's this? My kids' names. That's enough. Put your shirt on. It's enough. Put giri, ninjo in the balance... Obligation, inclination, which is most in a man's world? Obligation is. This the Kannon Goddess knows... The Kannon in my deepest heart. The tattooed peony lion cries, crying on my back. Are you fine with this? Let me do it! Let me! It's alright! It's bad for the baby! We'll have lunch! That's his. I'm sorry. I'm a bad wife. You aren't to blame. Yukio's an idiot. His shamelessness is a disgrace. But he'll come back. He has to. If that woman has a child, you'll be laughed at. You won't be able to show your face. I'm sorry. Don't worry. You ought to. You let him have his way. You ignored him. You always favored his brother. No, you spoiled him. I loved them both. Equally. Let's get back to work. Let's finish it. Akihiko's back! I'm back. Welcome home. Akihiko, I made some red rice. She got up early especially to cook it for you. She was so happy. How's your arthritis? Now my tooth hurts. You're a man now, Akihiko. The family can finally feel at ease. They have a real son now. He refused at first. It wasn't easy to convince him. I bought a new futon for you. How's the other old lady? Your friend? She died. She poisoned herself. Why? Her son deserted her. He left home with his wife. He works in a factory in Kashima. She was just left all alone. Suicide? Well, why not? So many funerals lately. We can't afford to always give something. I hear Akihiko bought his own truck. Farming isn't a man's job anymore. Yukio made the down payment of one million yen for it. Yukio's a good brother. Toshiya, watch out. Get down. Welcome home, Akihiko. Toshiya, I've got a present for you! The great Toshiya! I'll show you. Do it like this. Got it. Let me do it. Load up more! It'll be beyond the weight limit. Don't worry about the police. - What? - Toshiya misses you. Really? Don't look at me that way. I'm your brother. Remember? Got any speed? I quit. You need it to make three round-trips to Tokyo. To Tokyo again? The third time. You've got a lot of work. Got any for me? I got two families to support. I just want a desk job. You wouldn't even know how to talk to the customers. Hey, you're really loaded. Let's go! - Where to? - To Chiba, you know. Th- The Turkish bath? One of the girls there complained. She said she couldn't walk after you screwed her. - A drink? - No drunk driving for me. Heads. Tails. Heads. Losing 40,000 yen doesn't mean anything to you. Used to live in a shack, now you live in a mansion. This wood cost me 300,000 yen. I bought a truck and spent all the 60 million yen I got from selling my land. We paid six million in taxes. Farming doesn't make any money. Leave us alone. And no tea. Enjoy yourselves. Do it fast. You said it helped you work all night and you didn't get tired. It even made me quit alcohol. I started to take it to quit drinking. They all do it, don't they? Don't get scared. I'll do it this once to show you. Just don't get into the habit. Ready? Here we go. No change. Strange. It's coming. Blood's going to my head. More blood's coming. My legs are getting numb. Am I feeling high? Blood's rushing through my body. Do you feel like this, too? I'm not stuttering now. The blood is rushing all through my body. Is it good blood or bad blood? Feel's great. I wanna do something. I want to screw. I could screw any girl now. I can't get a hard-on. I'm getting high. Don't touch it! Toshiya, come! I took the day off. Because the customers took the day off. Shut up and enjoy yourself! What are you thinking? Nothing. Liar, that you'd have liked a boy more than a girl, right? I'm not thinking that. How about you? Me? Well... You want a marriage license? No! The kids' clothes and shoes cost me 80,000 yen. I'm nearly broke. I'll get some money somehow. Let's go eat something nice. Toshiya, Mariko! Let's go eat! Hasn't he come? He's important to us. Got to be good to him. I'm not good at this. You'll have to help me. Don't look at me that way. Think of our future. I did, so I came home. I didn't ask you to. You can go back to Tokyo. You left the family. They needed me. You want to get rid of my wife? I didn't say that. You want me to kill Junko and Mariko and come back home? Listen. A man has to... A man has to do what? You want to teach me a lesson? Go ahead. Excuse me, your guest is here. Thanks for the invitation. You used to drink a lot. You have a nice brother. What did you do in Tokyo? Construction work. You need a wife. Please find one, for him. He's bright, sincere, a nice guy. Not at all like me. For you, chief. Thanks. Later, I got a girl for you. Thanks to you, we'll be able to work out a good deal. Business is slow. Sure hope it get better. We're ready to supply all the sand you need. The Kashima factories are all built now. But we can't live just on farming. We owe our lives to you, chief. Please. We'll work for you. We'll do anything. Right, Akihiko? Please have some of these as well. I sure roped that fool in. He wants 10 trucks of sand a day. I have to get some truckers. I'm going to be the boss. I'll be busy. Work hard. Got a letter from mom. Is she still alive? Tough woman. She's in Akita. What's she doing there? I don't know. She didn't say. Poor mom... I'll buy more trucks. I'll make money. I'll build two big houses: one for you, the other one for my parents. But before that I'll take you and the kids to Hawaii. We can go to New York, too. I'll buy you a mink coat. Really? I'm happy. What about our marriage license? You want it so much? If it's possible. I'll manage. Soon. I'm glad. I want to be happy. I know. Here's a melon for you. Are you joking? We've been getting only five trucks of sand. You promised you'd bring 30 trucks. Couldn't get all the truckers. They were away fooling around. In slow times like these. Don't know what they are thinking. We have other suppliers of sand. Remember, you're running a business. Keep your promises. Work your men. Speak politely. I'll see to it that my boss overlooks it this one time. Sorry. I'll cover up for you. I'll help you. It's for your future, you know. Money? 100,000 yen. Are you all right? The police called us. I'm sorry. We can't see him yet. Really? He left his underwear, so I've brought some. Then I'll take back what I've brought. No, he'll need what you've brought, too. His mother isn't well. The Arthritis? He said she was getting better. I think I'll go. Goodbye. So you both blamed me, didn't you? We were worried about you. Worried about what? You don't know how I feel. I didn't say anything. She said your mother wasn't well. Am I to blame for that, too? Can't eat stuff like this. You know I'm a bad cook! You blame me for everything. You don't know anything. What will we do? We have to pay 300,000 yen for the gasoline tomorrow. I know that. You haven't paid the 500,000 yen for the tires. The money you get just disappears. We're deep in debt. Stop talking about money! Women! All the same! Get out! We'll sleep here. Because the moon is clear and blue... Let's walk home along the road... The road lined with sycamores... As we did when first we met. Remember how we walked together? Shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm... Happiness surrounding us... Let's walk home that way again. Thank you for everything. Got a cigarette, buddy? Thanks. I'm not like those crazy fellas. I'm normal unless I drink. They say I'm an alcoholic. I'm not an idiot. Buddy, my name is Ishizu. Would you stop by my wife? Tell her to send underwear and cigarettes real quick. And... Yukio, let's get outta here. Have I gotten thinner? No. Wonder if it was an overdose. Something weird got mixed in it. Maybe some spices. Stop joking. But it felt good. When I came back to my senses, I was strapped to the bed in the psychiatric hospital. I had bruises everywhere. I'm quitting now. Definitely quitting. What about you? I'm OK. It won't do me any harm. You'd better stop. And it costs a lot. Shut up! The bamboo fence of my neighbour... What the hell is that? They also taught me how to cure my stuttering at the hospital. What about the sand? I took the day off today. Sorry, all because of me. Not because of you. It's just annoying. Just a minute. Drinking fruit juice again? You're really pulling yourself together. So, who wants me tonight? Me... no... money. I know you. You paid six million yen in taxes last year. What a good citizen. You speak Japanese well. It's my third visit. I speak better Japanese than you. Yukio, you want a loan? Your old man and kids are in Taiwan. Send your money to them. Don't talk about Taiwan. I want to forget that country. I'm Japanese now. Sing for us! Go on, enjoy yourself. I want to sleep with you again. Not tonight. Go on with him. I went to the motel twice today. Japanese women never have to go there. I'm going home round the corner where I still can hear your voice. I'm searching for your footsteps in the freezing winter rain. I'm going home round the corner where I'm wanted no more. I saw you embracing a girl who had long hair, unlike me. My heart is crying round the corner. I'm no good at being alone. I don't like to be alone. Don't take away my heart. Don't leave me empty-hearted. I'm no good at being alone. Not tonight! I lent the money to your brother. That idiot should return it himself. I'll get it back from his pay. The price of cucumbers went down this year. I'm in debt myself. So I need this money. Thanks. You're a good man. I'll go back to Tokyo. Just joking. You've got to support your parents until your brother's son grows up. They're depending on you. So is his wife. Your father should have had more dignity. He ought to have scolded Yukio. But he changed since he came back from Manchuria after the war. We can't blame him. Thanks a lot. Here's your tea. I'm sorry. - I'm back. - Welcome back. You're young. You gotta use some make-up. You aren't stuttering anymore. She sells seashells by the seashore... He's working hard. He's been at it for five hours straight. Even skipped lunch. That's strange. Beautiful hub? It's sparkling. How about your car? - That's all right. - I'll clean it. You'd better break off with those punks. Are you preaching at me? Mind your own business. You can't live alone. There're people around you. You mean my wife? You pity her? Then go take care of her. Haven't you screwed her yet? She's a good lay. Go ahead. Grow up! I'm very sorry, boss. You worried about me, boss? Stop it! Damn you! I'll just walk out on you! I'll work alone! I'll pick up my pay later. All right. I don't want to see you again! Don't come back to the house. I can take care of them. You're not my brother anymore! I don't need your help! Drop dead, junkie! You're late. We're already starting. Are you my grandma? About Akihiko's future wife... will she be a good wife? Is it your grandmother? It's not her. Who is it? Your grandson. Kazuya? Are you Kazuya? You poor little thing, you poor boy. It's alright, it's alright. I'm cold, Daddy. Your daddy's coming home. Don't worry. Mama! Mama's stupid. Stupid! Help us! Pray for them every day. You ought to tend their graves. Help them to rest in peace. Where are you going? Going to feed the pigs. The ritual isn't even finished. Kazuya, please protect this house. Anyone here? I brought food for the pigs. Leave it out there. What kind of ritual is that? Who knows what those idiots are doing? Good pigs. You're good at raising them. Can I help you? No thanks. Are you back? I had a bad dream. My arm hurts. Where does it hurt? Maggots were crawling inside me. What a dream. Water... You smell nice. No, I don't. It's the smell of the bar. I'll go to work tomorrow. I'll work harder too. I won't complain. Yes. It's making me sick. No more drugs. Really? I'm already deep in debt. I'll start all over. I love you. I love you so. Eat a lot and put some weight on. Who gave you the money? The rich guy. Don't go to Akihiko. I won't. Don't open it. She came to complain. I don't want to hear it now. Tell her I'll go over later. - You tell her. - Just do it. Tell him Toshiya is sick. Really? It's a lie, but we have to tell him about Akihiko's marriage. Akihiko didn't want us to come here, but Yukio's his elder brother after all. You surprise me. Living with a married man... You ought to be ashamed of yourself. You even had his child. I don't know what you should do, but this just isn't right. What will you do? I hear he doesn't work. It would be better if he worked harder, wouldn't it? Is it all his fault? I didn't mean that. Take this. You need it. I can't. It should be me giving you money. Will you buy something good for him with this money? He likes fresh tuna. I should be taking better care of him. Thank you. I bore and raised Yukio, but my efforts are all wasted. How did it all turn out like this? Junko, you'd better start packing. Don't say that. Leave me. I don't want to be alone. Then take Mariko with you! I want to be with you. I'll work harder. I'll stay with you! You only talk! You're a bother to me! Get out! Where are you going? Junko, don't walk out on me. Been a long time. Four years, hasn't it? Are you busy? No, shall we go in? No. Over there then? I heard you're engaged. Congratulations. Come on in and meet her if you want. I want to! A dump truck's really big. Sometimes too big to handle. It makes humans little. I told Yukio to sell his truck, but he wouldn't. He can't move it. How much do you need? I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't ask you. How much? 500,000 yen. Okay, you'll get it by tomorrow. Thanks. He hits you? Don't worry. I hit him, too. Thanks for worrying. Your fiancée's parents don't like us, do they? They don't know. About my brother: you've got to be tougher on him. Of course it's his fault, but you're responsible, too. You've spoiled him. You have to think what you want. Don't let him ruin your life. Welcome back. Here's some juice. Is that her? She's pretty. Keep this a secret from Yukio. He'd kill me. Have some tea. I want to go home. See you. I see. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow then. Thanks. Hi, Yukio! Been a while. I thought you were dead. Not drinking? You quit? I don't like to drink anymore. Just one of the happy unemployed. Go over there and play. I'm looking for a job. How's your partner? He quit. Trucking's very slow. No jobs. Akihiko's doing all right. He's the only success around here. He has a lot of people to take care of. He's not taking care of me. Junko goes to see him a lot. He's a good man. He wouldn't touch her. Never can tell though. True, true. Damn Akihiko! He's trying to buy my woman. This is for your baby. Our baby? Take it. For your first child. But we're expecting the baby three months from now. It's too early for congratulations. Just to show my feelings. An earthquake! It's shaking. No, it isn't. Not at all. It is! It's an earthquake. Damn Akihiko. I'll kill him. Leave the kitchen knife. But if I don't have this then he'll kill me. He wants to. I've got to protect myself. It's legal, isn't it? A car's coming. It's coming here. I'm sure it's them. You're hearing things! Shut up! This time we've really go to be tough with him. Fumie. I'll return him to you. I don't want him! I just want to tell him I'm praying for my dead children. If he loves his son, he has to work. Loafing around like this at his age! Our ancestors won't forgive him for this. Close the shutters. Please! Do it! The bathroom, too! He's worse than you were. He ought to be sent to a hospital. Not just before Akihiko gets married. We can't let the girl's family know. What's he up to? Be careful not to get involved. Akihiko will be coming up through this hole. Dad, Mom, Junko, Fumie... They're all coming to kill me. We'll go back now. Mom, let me fix your sash. Are you ready? The bride's still getting dressed. It's late. How much for the priest? 10,000 yen? How much for the chauffeur? 3,000 yen is enough. No, 5,000. So much? Don't be stingy at a time like this. Uncle, take off the lens cap. He's eating too much. Toshiya, behave yourself. Stop eating. He's addicted to red rice. He's stubborn like his father. Will Yukio come? He's the eldest son. He has to attend the wedding ceremony. I suppose so. You don't know, but in this world there are rules you have to respect. It's bad to go against them. He's the groom's brother. He'll come. He has to. Congratulations. Akihiko, come with me. We've been waiting. Let's go. There's nothing to worry about. Toshiya wanted to see you. Akihiko, apologize to me. Apologize! Don't you ever see Junko again. What's gotten into you? Next time I'll kill you. I don't understand. Apologize! Promise you won't see her again. Say you're sorry! I love Junko. I'm depending on her. You've always taken everything from me. Since we were kids, you've stolen whatever belonged to me. But we're brothers. Brothers? Did you realize that only now? The way you won dad over to your side. You can't blame things on him. I'll say you caught a cold. What about the wedding? They must have been waiting for you. I'll make lunch for you, but... You take the marriage money over. 50,000 yen ought to be enough. Won't it? Mom wrote to me. She's in Aomori now. Kobayashi's in the trucking business. Funny, isn't it? She didn't write what she's doing, so I don't know. Give it up! Leave me alone! Please stop it! I'm begging you! Please give it up! We'll starve at this rate. That's fine. I'd love that. Why are you like this? You didn't use to be. You weren't like this before. I'm through. I can't get any worse. I'm happy. Don't be stupid. I'm sick of living like this. I can't stand this sex either. We haven't had done it much recently. And we won't anymore! Take Mariko away to your mom in Aomori. I'd like to. You would, huh? I know all about your affairs. Please go find some work. I want to see you driving a truck again, like a man. I'm asking you again. Please work. Well, again. Leave me alone. No, I won't. Please let me stay with you. Don't do that. I don't want to touch you. You're no different than your mom. Understand? You caused all this. You ruined me. I hate you. I hate you and Akihiko. You can stay if you want. If you want to get out, get out. Mommy's busy. Go and play somewhere. Be good now. Come back later. I'm bad. I couldn't make you quit. I wanted to, but... I felt sorry for you. I thought you could give it up. I was bad. But you're much worse. Much, much worse! If only you'd tried harder, you wouldn't have ruined yourself. What was your tattoo for, anyway? Your dead kids are both laughing at you. They're saying you aren't a man. You cause trouble to everyone around you. You blame others, but not yourself. You're not human - you're an animal, a beast. Die! I never want to see you again. What are you doing? Is it alright like this? Okay, we're ready. Please look this way. Yukio looked so innocent. He even smiled. I didn't expect that. I forgot to ask why he gave me a gift for my baby. Before she was even born. Funny. Did he? I wonder why. You didn't smoke before, didn't you? I just started, recently. Welcome home. What'll he get? Eight years. Where's Mariko? Maybe at the pigsty. Yukio looked all right. Really? The pigs are escaping! Help me!
