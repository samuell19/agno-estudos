When you listen to the radio, remember how people came to have this wonderful tool of communication. The original source of all technical achievements is the divine curiosity and play instinct of the tinkering and brooding researcher, and, to no lesser extent, the technical inventor's constructive imagination. WHO RULES THE WORLD? AN OVERDOSE OF FACEBOOK ADVERTISING IS MASS SURVEILLANCE DETECTION OF SECRET PROGRAMMES WHISTLEBLOWERS FOR THE TRUTH? ALONE AGAINST AMERICA I'M TAKING YOUR FREEDOM IS THERE STILL ROOM FOR UTOPIAS? FORGET ABOUT IT AND NOW.: SWITCH OFF WE ARE THE INTERNET. ABOUT DIGITAL RESISTANCE MODEMS FOR ALL HACKER HOME COMPUTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE HOME COMPUTER SCREEN TRICKS ALL IS ONE. EXCEPT 0. I used to do a lot of programming. There was no other way. When I switched on my computer, it expected instructions in a programming language, a kind of "screen Lego". We all helped each other out with this. But first, I'd like to introduce myself. POETRONIC is my name, at least in the online universe. It's also the name of one of the first programmes I wrote. It automatically generates poems. I'm a writer, and it was clear to me at the time that I first had to teach my computer the lyrical modes of expression used by poets. I first heard about a "Chaos Computer Club" and a certain Dr Wau in the early 1980s. I immediately envisaged a kind of rocket scientist wearing a white lab coat and with a slide rule and ballpoint pen in his breast pocket. When I first met Wau in Hamburg back then, the door opened and what looked like a hobgoblin in rustic knickerbockers came into the room, a chubby, cheerful, bacchanalian chap. Very much the opposite of what I had imagined. But I liked him right away. Wau was someone who connected the 19805 and 1705 with the future. Someone who set a course that enabled a subculture to become the central technical, cultural and economic current that led into the 21st century. A hacker is a person who doesn't let himself be turned on only by the surface, hut who tries to find out what else can he done with it, especially on a technical level: the creative, inventive use of technology. Complexity is the combination of many single things, each one of which seems manageable. If we take a car and a goods waggon, we can combine them to make a Motorail train. Now you're standing at a closed level crossing barrier, waiting for the train to come. In the distance, you hear the wild, arrhythmic beeping of car horns. What caused them to go off? Alarm systems with motion detectors. Complexity cannot be mastered. You can deal with individual things, but you will be forced to face problems that cannot in any way be foreseen. Unpredictability is an essential element of the time in which we live. We he came friends at computer speed. I once criticised "Die Datenschleuder", the new club magazine, and Wau said: You do it! So I became editor-in-chief. And because I have rheumatism, we held the editorial conference every Thursday in my flat. Sometimes people stayed there till Monday. ABWÄRTS "Computer State", 1981 THE DOOMSDAY SHOW Reagan made this joke at a microphone rehearsal, probably regretting it later. But the Cold War between East and West was still on, and Germany was the buffer. We were caught between these hardened fronts. On Monday there's a knock on the door and Arafat stands before you, Tuesday there's a test alarm and paranoia on the tram. Wednesday the war ls very cold Brezhnev's lurking I the public baths. Wau could get East and West German TV. STOP INNER-GERMAN BORDER So he could clearly see how information was distorted. Not by real lies, but by omissions. We questioned the norms of our society: was there a better system in which everyone could be as free as possible? On the Left, there was clandestine sympathy for those who'd engaged in armed resistance because they considered themselves to be at war with the system. LSD FOR ALL PRISON GUARDS But Wau didn't like violence or the dogmatic Marxism of many left-wingers. His sympathies lay with the "Spontis", who organised the TUNIX Congress in 1978, which marked a watershed for the alternative movements. DREAM IS REALITY Thursday, you already know, 2 thousand agents in the sewers. Friday belongs to the Mafia, the ravioli comes from Florid. Saturday evening lunatic asylum, the KGB in the German forests. Sunday, everything is dear] World war is near in the Gulf of Mallorca. Instead of engaging in a hopeless confrontation with the state, they opted to create "free zones". Stalingrad Stalingrad. Germany, a catastrophic state. We live in a computer state. We live in a computer state. We live in a computer state. Against this background, TAZ, the first alternative daily newspaper was founded. At the same time, the Green Party was founded, and the PC revolution began. But there was still little confidence in an electronic future. Most people were suspicious of the new technology. At this time a census was held. KNOWLEDGE FOR THE FUTURE It smacked of an Orwellian police state. NO CONTROLS FOR THE FUTURE There was a massive movement to boycott the census: unimaginable today! KEEP YOUR DATA SECRET You guarantee the data will remain confidential? - Yes. At the meetings that we, the computer-mad mob, were holding at that time, we eventually reached a point where we began to think about finding a name for ourselves, as well as about meeting more regularly and making contacts nationwide. Then we placed a classified ad in the TAZ and met at the TAZ offices in Berlin in order to launch the Chaos Computer Club. And if you want to discuss things as a group, it's also very helpful to be able to look each other in the eye and discuss things calmly. It was actually really great that the computer always played a secondary role, that the social event Chaos Computer Club was always the more interesting aspect. And that's the core of what the Chaos Computer Club is to me: realising that people are more important than machines. The fascinating thing about the Chaos Club was that the computer functioned as a kind of social catalyst. It was a place where people with radically differing opinions and worldviews, from very different age groups and social backgrounds, sat down at one table and talked and argued with each other. I know, you've seen this before. Oh no, not again! Not now, please! Sometimes science fiction helps us to understand history. The last lines of "Shockwave Rider" contain two suggestions. "One: This is a rich planet. Therefore poverty and hunger are unworthy of it and we are obliged to eradicate them. Two: We are a civilised species. Therefore, in future, no one should create an unfair advantage for themselves by abusing the fact that our combined knowledge is greater than what any one of us can know." People saw the new computer technology as a way towards a utopian society. We were impressed how the novel "Shockwave Rider" predicted the current situation, and by Robert Anton Wilson, who wrote the "llluminatus" conspiracy trilogy. Wilson said that computers would totally change our society in the next few years. He said that holding knowledge would supersede holding property and that knowledge would be held by a small conspiratorial group. And Hagbard Celine fought against these people. I realised that "Illuminatus! might be more real than I thought Some of our members were only interested in the wonderful world of technology, others were also interested in science fiction and thought about questions of societal development. Hippie activist Stewart Brand and his crew had been publishing the catalogue since 1968 and wanted to attain a networked consciousness. Brand was also one of the Merry Pranksters who rode around in a colourfully painted bus distributing LSD for free. In 1984, he organised the Hackers Conference, bringing together flower children and hackers. Steve Jobs once called the Whole Earth Catalog "the search engine before Google™. The seeds for the world's most powerful Internet companies were clearly sown during this LSD-infused time. I met Tim Leary there: a hit too American for my taste, too much into self-promotion, but otherwise a fascinating person. Not only Leary dreamt of this! Here are the "hacker ethics" by Stephen Levy. Access to computers and anything that can teach you how the world really works should be unlimited and total. All information should be free. Mistrust authority, promote decentralisation. You can create art and beauty on a computer. Computers can change your life for the better. Hackers should be judged by their actions, not bogus criteria such as appearance, age, origin, species, gender or social position. But the CCC added rules to the American hacker ethics. "Don't mess with data!" is the first thing that occurs to me: handle other people's data with care. "Use public data, protect private data." When I look at political practice in this country, the opposite often seems to he true. But this idea really nails it, especially regarding our use of other people's data, something we're now increasingly confronted with. The "hacker ethics" came from the MIT. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a kind of Vatican for technology lovers. There has been a model railway club there since 1946. The people who thought up the circuits and inventively constructed them were called "hackers". These experiences had given them a good understanding of computer hardware, and so the club became the nucleus of the worldwide hacker movement in the 1970s. The problem was the Federal Post Office in West Germany. This had a legally enshrined monopoly on all telecommunications technology. You weren't even allowed to repair your own telephone socket. Then another one of the Chaos Computer Club's "Gyro Gearlooses" marched in and said: "You need a modem." - I said: "A what?" A modem allows you to travel without you actually going anywhere. You have no feeling of space or distance anymore, it's like a global village, like having the whole world on your desk. But how do you connect a computer to the phone? For this, you need an acoustic coupler. This is our do-it-yourself acoustic coupler, the "Data Lavatory". You can get the plans from "Schwarzmarkt" in Hamburg. It includes rubber stoppers, which you can get from bathroom stores. These fit over your telephone's mouth- and earpieces. Because it's a DIY device, it's not approved by the Federal Post Office, which is why I'm showing you the approved version. It works like this: the computer generates characters and the acoustic coupler converts them into tones. I'll demonstrate this by typing in a "u" and then holding it to the microphone. You'll then hear what a "u" sounds like when the computer makes the sound. But we can try it the other way round too. If I whistle into the device, it will try to convert my whistling into letters of the alphabet. Now you can see some nonsense on the screen, because I can't whistle as well as a computer. Now ['ll call a computer and make a connection to it Am I online or what? I'm online! Then Steffen entered Wau's life. The domestic intelligence service asked me where you can learn to hack. I said you can't learn it it's an attitude to life. It'll stay exciting and there's plenty to explore in data networks and with computers. Steffen was a doer. At 14 he was a junior firefighter, then head pupil. At 22, he joined the CCC, where he was soon feared for his actionistic organisational talent. For him, every ideology had something limiting about it. His meeting Wau came at just the right time. Is it a movement that might take over the whole population? That's a beautiful utopia! You can cause a lot of mischief. The German teletext system is a huge advertising wall, so to speak. El Springer Publishing, for example, advertises its products here. Hey, what's this? I'm Bix from the Federal Post Office. 1 offer your TV access to the modern computer world, And once again, we had a strange experience when we had to deal with the FTZ, the central telecommunications authority. They also have Btx and are actually responsible for security in Btx What's the password at their headquarters? And Steffen said: "Maybe their own telephone number?" First attempt: a hit! We fell... We fell about laughing for 10 minutes because we just couldn't believe it. It says in the state treaty on teletext: Videotext is also intended for games. You even have a programme to annoy the Federal Post Office: they pay you nine marks and you play them a film you made in which you rubbish them. We did it because we were angry with them. We blew up their post-horn logo with a little atomic mushroom cloud. We wanted to express our anger somehow... Good evening. The Minister for Postal Affairs won't like this, but the Federal Post Office's teletext system isn't tamper-proof. Using the customer ID of Haspa, a Hamburg bank, the Bix crackers activated their own video. This costs the Federal Post Office 9,90 marks per view. Then we started the machine, which pressed the button all night long. I slept next to it, it kept going "clicker, clicker..." The next morning, the hackers had bagged 135,000 marks from Haspa. We didn't think it was possible. We've already taken action: we changed our personal password immediately, so that Mr Holland can no longer use these means in order to... In order to disadvantage us. Then the flat was overrun by journalists, and we were confronted with problems we'd never known before. We suddenly had to do media management. Germany's most famous hacker, data artist Wau Holland! So what you're doing is breaking into other people's databases or computer systems? I don't see it as breaking in. They're like department stores: brightly lit places where you can go in and take a look around. International data networks are similar: you go in, take a look around. That's when we realised that the dimensions of our actions hadn't been clear to us at all. We didn't know you could get up to five years in prison for interfering with someone else's system and installing and operating telecommunications equipment without authorisation, a punishment more severe than for the negligent triggering of a nuclear explosion. After the Haspa hack, the club became unexpectedly popular. During this time, Andy Müller-Maguhn joined. At the age of 15, he was the club's youngest member. He was also very enthusiastic about computers and came every day. Conveniently, the club was on his way to school. Me and my computer we used to be a team. Plastic with the apple I # never understand your The first Chaos Communication Congress took place in Hamburg in 1984. There were workshops on modems and computer mailboxes, but also on psychological disorders caused by computer abuse. No dongle, no fiat rate, inbox full 2 Trojan's got in. Software fucked, contacts deleted pin code forgotten. Bank transfer not possible, cursor not moving. Data surplus, no wireless LAN, email not answered, spam answered. Too few megabytes, hourglass, hourglass... This is the Chaos Communication Congress, and anyone who assumes that some kind of major hack or break-ins into other people's databases will take place here must really be quite stupid. We meet to exchange information, not via telecommunications or new media, but from person to person. Because many things can only be exchanged directly. I'm far more interested in making people aware of what personal data is and what dangers it poses. Because data processing, public access, automated retrieval and processing bring a new quality to the data, even at the moment when the information content initially seems ridiculously low. 1984: the first Macintosh is launched. 7985: the first Commodore Amiga ls launched As an information provider, the CCC legally used the Federal Post Office teletext system 10 publish a shocking case study from a urological doctoral thesis. Title: "Penis Injuries Caused by Masturbation with Vacuum Cleaners." They put their penis in here and nothing happens. So with their flaccid penis in here, they turn on the vacuum cleaner and the penis becomes erect. - You can switch off if you like! But the manufacturer wasn't impressed and threatened the hackers with a hefty fine. SUCTION ALONE WON'T SATISFY YOU At some point, we registered the CCC as a legally recognised club, in order to defend ourselves against the potential threat of us being declared a criminal association. Our job is to break into this bank and get everything we're entitled to, regardless of the consequences. The CCC even used the quote from "Decoder" in a study it carried out for the new Green Party. We discovered that Bonn really was so deathly grey and the administration so tough. And the Green Party was an absolute disaster. For the Greens, computers are the work of the devil The hackers' conclusion: "The introduction of computer technology Is as diff cult for the Greens as phasing out nuclear energy is for others." TRUST NO COMPUTER THAT YOU CAN'T BEAR Defend yourselves and resist, stop nuclear power stations in our land. Defend yourselves and resist stop nuclear power stations in our land. Power to the people, power to the people, even if the nuclear waste train comes. Power to the people, power to the people, even if the nuclear waste train comes. Come on, defend yourselves and resist stop nuclear power stations in our land... The first MCA, maximum credible accident: warnings against consuming salad, mushrooms, milk. For the first time since the war there was a shortage in Germany, a shortage of information. After the accident in Chernobyl, people from the CCC scene used private computer networks to spread measurement data and information on radioactive radiation. They did this more quickly than the government or the press, who initially covered things up and fobbed off the public. Yes. Absolutely impossible, because a hazard only exists within a radius of 30 to 50 km around the reactor. The recommendation applies to the milk from the cow but not to the milk from the dairy. For hackers, it was a key moment. But the CCC's own MCA was yet to come. Real hackers from Germany have broken into sensitive data networks worldwide in the last three months. The perpetrators are still unknown, but the Hamburg Chaos Computer Club Is now the voice of the secret hackers. These are mainframe computers by the firm Digital that are mainly used in the field of research: industrial research, high energy, astrophysics, aerospace. The systems directly affected are computers that belong to a special network that was set up by NASA to organise the exchange of data for the needs of NASA and for the needs of the aerospace industry. The things the hacker kiddies did, they really sickened us. The idea was to prove that you really have power over the system, that you could exchange the contents of CASTOR and POLLUX's hard drives. They were NASA's two mainframe computers. We said: "For heaven's sake: the moment you gain access somewhere, you carry a terrible responsibility." We informed the domestic intelligence service, so that they could inform the CIA, so that they would know about it before it appeared in the papers. We also informed the manufacturer. We were hoping the systems would already have been secured by the time it appeared in all the media, but that wasn't the case. Nighttime raid at the Chaos Computer Club in Hamburg. 15 officers from Hamburg, as well as French and federal police officers, searched the rooms of the computer club and three private flats. Hackers are believed to have penetrated the European nuclear research centre's computer. I was relatively friendly to the officers and made them a coffee during the search. Steffen was a hit harder on them. The officers, including those from the French and federal police, had to form a queue outside, and he had everyone show him their ID card. In his fire-brigade manner, Steffen discovered that one of their IDs had expired. And he did what the fire brigade had taught him to do: he made the guy go to the back of the queue. Officers will be searching into the early hours. "A search warrant is being executed and this will take until the early hours." And Steffen said: "Am I actually under arrest now?" - "No, you're not." "Then I'm going out to give an interview." In my capacity as club spokesman, I have to say that I was not involved in any of the stories mentioned here, and that I consider my livelihood to be threatened by the actions of the authorities. I consider this to be unreasonable, as there's also the option of us discussing this calmly if the gentlemen have problems. But they seem to prefer trying to criminalise me. We'll have to see what happens now. HACKER WERNERY ARRESTED IN PARIS REFUSES TO COOPERATE WITH POLICE CHAOS COMPUTER CLUB IN CRISIS I was aware, when I travelled to Paris, that the French authorities might ask me to say something. However, I did not assume that I would end up in prison. I've done nothing wrong, so I saw no reason for me not to go to France. Considering you've hardly slept, you look great. - Must be the make-up. You've just spent 59 days in prison. How was it? Were you with other people or alone in a cell with bars? French prisons are actually very simple, you might say. There are three- and four-person cells, usually cramped, due to lack of space. The facilities are pretty limited, too. For example, if we wanted to boil some water, we had to use an improvised stove made of Kleenex tissues and olive oil to heat up the water in a tin can. Very simple and primitive. Is there an extractor fan? - An extractor fan? When do you reach the point when you want to crawl up the walls, when you want to scream? After four weeks you start to feel that the walls are closing in on you, hut the others notice that and then you get over it. I can't think of much at all that I should tell you, but I think you might have a lot of questions. To put it bluntly, the accusations made against me are that I committed theft and deliberate destruction. I'll start again right away. I think it's totally wrong to be hunting young people because of this. If someone leaves his car key in, he shouldn't be surprised if someone takes his car for a spin. Is hacking a tightrope walk in the data network? - Among other things. We've gone beyond simple computer hacking: there's social hacking, reality hacking. Last night, someone said: "What's hacking a computer compared to hacking society?" How's that happening? - Through freedom of information. Feverishly awaited: a panel discussion between hackers and the state. Hamburg's highest-ranking domestic intelligence officer was going to come. We've had so much stress and so much bother, so we think it's nice to have the opportunity to talk about our ideas and ask: How do we proceed? We want to work openly, and we have to achieve that. Lochte cancelled at the last minute, claiming his personal safety would be compromised. A video recording of a TV discussion from the evening before was quickly fetched, The domestic intelligence service should hire the hackers, because they show you the gaps in your data. They're difficult to recruit for our work. But you haven't received any such offers yet? Well, I haven't myself. - But? To my knowledge, others have turned them down. Our principle is the open use of data, the open use of systems. And in this area there are many scandals and situations that the domestic intelligence service is aware of but won't talk about. So in this respect, when we find out about things like Chernobyl, where the state authorities kept silent and disinformed us, we try to inform the public and act openly. Are you concealing anything, Mr Lochte? - No, and I reject your assertion, especially regarding Chernobyl. You'd have to be more specific. There is a lot of data, information, about which government agencies are informed That's kept secret. And if I consider that, along with the personal stress we've had with investigating authorities... At that time, and a number of our friends criticised us sharply for this, we gave the domestic intelligence service information about the NASA hack. But I could imagine that there are also hackers who act in secret, rather than having an open approach. Something like that is possible. But we've been crystal clear about this from the very beginning: the moment someone starts to hack for financial gain, this is a fundamental violation of our idea of hacker ethics, approach to hacking and open use. But what about the very human openness to blackmail? How do you stop it? - By not being open to blackmail. As a lifestyle, an attitude: that's the essential thing. An economic whodunnit called "Tanker" was scheduled for tonight, but we're not going to show it. Instead, you're about to see an espionage thriller, a real one. Today, a spy ring was busted that stole via computer cables top secret military, scientific and economic data from computer centres in the USA, Europe and Japan, and sent it to the Eastern bloc. German hackers played a key role. One of those involved was the young hacker Karl Koch. He'd founded a branch of the CCC in Hanover. Together with three friends, he hacked into American computer systems, and sold the information thus collected to the KGB in East Berlin. But worst of all was the news of Koch's death. Three months after the official discovery of the KGB hack, Karl Koch's charred body was found in a wood. Apparently it was suicide. But the role played by the domestic intelligence service is still unclear today. Imagine a friend of yours goes missing without telling anyone why. You know he'd been through a rough time: he'd got mixed up in espionage and the intelligence services had grilled him, he'd been locked up in a psychiatric clinic and journalists had used him. "ALL GREAT ANARCHISTS DIED ON THE 23RD." I believe he was murdered so that Germany's reunification wouldn't be jeopardised. The journalists had a major story in preparation, KGB, hackers, etc., at exactly the time when Gorbachev was due to be visiting Germany. Unfortunately, Karl died just prior to this, so the story didn't appear in the press during Gorbachev's visit. What we were afraid of is now happening: young hackers and computer criminals are being lumped together. They're then given a good stir and forced into a dark corner where they're open to blackmail. And just as the domestic intelligence service tried to recruit spies in East Germany, they also tried to recruit hackers who would work here for West Germany. And that can't really be the point: making young, committed people, who actually want to work constructively, the plaything of the secret services. It's a catastrophic development. The secret services have been playing this game for thousands of years. They've played it consistently throughout history, from the Stasi to the East German domestic intelligence service, put in modern terms. And the institutional know-how they have about this game is such that anyone who thinks they can join in and influence anything is simply a megalomaniac. Where I have a hit of a problem or hope for the future is that we can deal with similar incidents in future in a more relaxed way instead of decrying these people as not being hackers, not belonging to us. For me it was unimaginable that a hacker would pass on information to, of all things, a state-controlled secret service. But that's the "occupational accident" that occurred at the Chaos Computer Club. You brought the term hacker into disrepute in a way I wouldn't have expected from you. But at the end of the day, you can't prevent people from straying in that direction. Each club consists of individuals! The person next to you might be a spy and you don't notice for three or four years. You could even live with one and not know. These kinds of things really happen. Hello, who is this? Christian, kick everyone without ID out of your room. They should report here. Over and out. The KGB hack led to our expulsion from hackers' paradise. The people in the club not only felt surrounded by secret services, they also began to mistrust each other. An international industrial exhibition in Moscow. State Council Chairman Erich Honecker presents Mikhail Gorbachev with the first megabit chip "made in East Germany". The People's Liberation Army shoots at its own people, at peaceful unarmed citizens. That same year, the Game Boy was launched in Japan and became the best-selling handheld console in the world. And the first Love Parade was held in Berlin. Just 150 ravers met for a demonstration in central Berlin under the slogan: Love, Peace and Harmony. Berlin, the night of 9 November, 1989, All border crossings from East Germany to West Germany and West Berlin will be opened. To my knowledge with immediate effect. Right that's it ls it working again? Every night at half past midnight, when the TV shuts down, 1 tie on my bed and wonder what it would be like I weren't who I am but chancellor, emperor, king or queen. What Kohl can do, I can do as well, I'd listen to Vivaldi, day in, day out. I would get around lot, travel to the USA, bite Ronnie's calves like Wald would All this and much more I would do if I were King of Germany. Hello? Network busy! What the fuck? In keeping with our desire for unimpeded worldwide communication, in our view, a further wall has fallen and we now have to fulfil an obligation to share knowledge with you. Here in East Germany, there's lots of experience. Because it's not like we're gurus or leaders of some clubs or other. Everyone has his abilities, his strengths and weaknesses. And the best way to get along with each other is to pool our resources. Steffen wanted the 1989 Chaos Congress to take place in East Berlin as the first all-German event. He wanted to show how progressive and flexible hackers are. But some months passed before a first conference took place in Berlin. It was clear that the Hamburg crowd wouldn't come no matter what I have to say. In Hamburg, they'd rather stir their own shit than tear down intellectual walls. The worldly ones are gone. Steffen, I've followed the whole thing. In my view, the only stubborn die-hard in the club was you. In the last few years, Steffen, the person over there, took care of most of the organisational stuff. But now he's given up for some reason. Afterwards, Andy Müller-Maguhn became the CCC's spokesman. We as a club have set ourselves the task of informing the public about what you can do with computers and also what you shouldn't do with them. And we've also set ourselves the task of mapping out these different aspects. What we don't do is hack into other people's computers, which we're often accused of. Instead, we act as intermediaries between hackers, the public and system operators, and we also publish materials, including our own magazine, that help people to build their own computer networks, etc. From free speech to pure joy. I'll begin by quickly introducing myself. I'm Wau Holland, and I'm celebrating the 40th anniversary of the day I was produced. I've been in telecommunications since they cut my umbilical cord. And I'm active in various places as a data artist and hit-smith. Longing.. Longing.. Longing comes out of chaos. Longing.. We drove here... We drove here this afternoon. I see. - We've been here since Sunday evening... Come on in, then. You're nice and summery! ...my longing, my addiction. Longing.. Longing is the only... ..energy. Now that I'm living in a village in the Thuringian Forest: the Thuringian Mountains, they're something I missed here in Hamburg. I couldn't stay in such a flat place, that much was clear. And the second thing is: a person's character is strongly influenced by what his mother feeds him. So that's why the Thuringian eating habits, which I got to know as a child, are a different style of digestion than the Hamburg cuisine, which is why I feel more comfortable there. When I'm in llmenau and walk through the town, I meet lots of people anyway, because in a small town of 30,000 people, you cross each other's paths. Direct exchange is where you get the most information across. At the end of the 1990s, Wau arrived in Jena, where an Internet start-up was having a huge impact on the stock market. They offered Wau a well-paid job, as a data protector. But Wau preferred to continue his job at the local youth centre. We live in rags. we love the night our time Is always now. We have made the bourgeais philistines anxious, and we laugh whenever they harry us. We have made the bourgeais philistines anxious, and we laugh whenever they harry us. For many years, Wau was a member of the Association of European Boy Scouts, an organisation which even then imagined a Europe without borders. In the Boy Scouts, my nickname was "Mole". And when I started programming, I shortened it to Wau, and because of my nature, my friends didn't see me as a professor but as Doctor Wau. Little Dr Wau skimmed through his first children's hook when he was 10. He told his mother that he'd simply left out anything unimportant. I love this story! Wau had a very democratic home, but his mother died when he was 13. A huge shock. He started working very early and... ...got my radio amateur licence, repaired TVs and radios. I operated a drill for a week at a radio and TV dealer's in Marburg. The next week I worked at a private telephone branch exchange, strictly forbidden for a schoolboy. I really enjoy information ethics, questions of responsibility when dealing with information. I think the Chaos Computer Club will continue to exist for a very long time to come, certainly in cooperation with many large companies and not least with the federal government, right? The civil rights movement is more important to me! For me, the nodes are the most interesting aspect of a network. These are connected to a great many other points, and if you look at a node there's no way of telling what this node is connected to. And this is an interesting characteristic of communication. Right now, I'm talking into a camera, into a microphone, and I've no idea where this recording will end up and what will be done with it. But certain thoughts and ideas arrive somewhere and act as a trigger. There's always a war going on somewhere, and communication is a chance not only to provoke, hut also to de-escalate and defuse conflicts. At the same time, CERN researcher Tim Berners-Lee developed a concept for a hypertext project that would simplify the worldwide exchange of information. This is now known as the World Wide Web, with all its pros and cons. You spend the first two years in a state of euphoria. You don't think, you just spend weeks trying out the possibilities: the first ascent of the high score table without oxygen. And the moment you not only write an email, or, even more anonymously, fill in a form on some website or other, just having two recipients is enough for this to result in you having made a public statement, which, in extreme cases, can land you in trouble, sometimes years later, because of how you once saw things and what you once said. I like to use myself as a deterrent. Anyone wanting to do research using keywords like "fuck Wau", "Wau dirty bastard", "Wau arsehole" or "Wau women's representative" and so on... They'll find all manner of flames that I was involved in in recent years, and so they can use all these things to put together an absolutely hateful picture of me and garnish it with original quotations to really finish me off. And then the business with Tron happened. Tron was a good friend of Andy's, an exceptional hacker. In 1997, Tron was the first to crack the phone card system. That got him 10 months on probation. He then developed a cryptophone that made the tap-proof encryption of ISDN telephone calls possible. Everyhody was interested in someone like that, from the secret service to industry to the Mafia. I'd like to give you a few evaluations from memory. I just learnt from Andy that Tron has disappeared. On Monday, Andy said: We'll find him dead in the next few days. And I asked, do you have any other, more positive vision than this one? And Andy said: No! That was already pretty tough on Monday. Then I went to the Better Research booth, they do the encryption for DR, for the Kirch media group, and I told them, I can't say why, that we urgently needed to get in touch with their security guy. So was clear that he hadn't gone anywhere of his own free will, but had been violently abducted. And we just hoped to find his telephone, as this was still in the network. The body was found by walkers, hanging from a tree in a wood. POLICE DOUBT DEATH WAS SUICIDE HACKER "TRON": HIS DEATH REMAINS A MYSTERY Two dead hackers were enough for me. That's self-protection. Plus, if I realise that I can no longer implement my ideas in one structure, then I have to look for a new one. In 1997, me and a few others founded "The Lockpickers' Club". Yes, Mr Wernery... Great... - Yeah, is this the first time? What? - In handcuffs. It is indeed. We're interested in the non-violent and non-destructive opening of locks of all kinds, this is called "lockpicking". For me, this is a hacker sport. I can research freely without all that political, ideological and intelligence stuff. Nevertheless, I'm still very attached to the CCC, but no longer in the front row. Wau withdrew more and more from club activities. Organising education at a time when knowledge is developing rapidly is a problem. We don't have enough people who can understand and solve the problem. This is a vicious circle, and it can only be broken if competent people pass on their knowledge to others as quickly as possible. In a globally networked world, isolated concepts stand no chance. Strongest are those who exchange experience and so have more common experiences. I volunteered in a youth centre in Jena for 15 months and looked after the Internet room. It was actually my expectation that it would become a paid job. But when after a year, 15 months, that still hadn't happened, I said: "OK... I'll look for something else." And "something else" meant either I go to Dortmund and start a similar project there, or I go to Munich, or wherever. And one of the options I had was Berlin. Every time he left a place, he left everything just as it was. I think the way his room looked reflected the way he often was inside. Wau was restless, and most of all neglected himself. Many of his friends were worried about his health. I'm aware of the fact that at certain points, when I work 36 hours without a break, I am overexploiting my hody. But, damn it, it's my body, my body belongs to me. And what I do with it is my business. OK, I'm done. Over to you, Schultz. And then, in the prime of life, he collapsed. He'd had a stroke. Then he died. This is Project Blinkenlights in Paris, with a tribute to Wau. The photo of him was generated by 520 illuminated windows. The first Blinkenlights installation was in Berlin in 2001, shortly after his death. The lamps behind the windows could he controlled via mobile phone, meaning that messages could be placed on the building's facade. If love alone counted, if love alone counted, I would travel the same road for you again. If love alone counted, if love alone counted, I would follow you to the ends of the earth, No price is too high for me to see you. 20 years have passed since Wau's death. The CCC still exists and has become a respectable authority. Wau's heirs have continued in his spirit. It's almost impossible to pick out a single event... Well, maybe this one here. Another major coup: Interior Minister Schäuble's fingerprint. Using the simplest means, a copy is made. The CCC struck a massive blow against the government at that time. This called into question the security of biometric data of the kind used in passports. If what the Chaos Computer Club's experts claim to have discovered is true... I have to put it so cumbersomely, as there's no irrefutable evidence, but if it's true, then the computer surveillance methods used in Germany are criminal or at least criminally reckless. At least according to the CCC. They claim the government has developed a Trojan that picks up more data than constitutionally allowed. It gives you total remote control. This spyware allows you to do whatever you want with someone's computer. You can upload and run any software you've programmed on it. The Chaos Communication Congress has blossomed too. Every year, shortly after Christmas, 17,000 visitors now come to an international event lasting several days. Originally, it was just a few hundred. A team of volunteers, the "Chaos Angels", help to perfectly organise everything. The rocket's been greeting you at these events for years. You've all seen it. And the first camp was a kind of new beginning, a launch. And there's a video of Wau speaking at that camp. And we need to listen to it. I remembered a time in the 1980s, when we were invited to the Open Ear Festival in Mainz. We were allocated a garage, known as the "Techno Shed", and this had a single telephone line with an acoustic coupler: 300 hits per second. Today we have about 100,000 times that connection capacity, hut most of it runs via the Internet, and the whole camp is self-organised. I couldn't have imagined it back then. Here we have the rocket, which we're going to launch again. And sometimes it runs into turbulence, 0 we provide sick bags. We thought: "What would be a suitable symbol for this congress?" And, of course, it's the phase tester, which you all know. Probably Wau's old joke, because he always carried a phase tester. And if someone asked him what it was for he just said: "I might need to make a phone call." One of the best things this year was what took place in Berlin-Südkreuz, where the government is trying to normalise camera surveillance with automatic facial recognition by carrying out a field test at the train station there, where several cameras are feeding a number of facial recognition systems. There was a lovely protest action against this. SUSPICIOUS SURVEILLANCE ACCESS FOR MODEL CITIZENS The thing is, this isn't about gathering information on terrorists. This isn't about catching criminals. The purpose of this video surveillance is to say to people who don't want to conform: Make sure you behave yourselves, or we'll see you and get you. "YOU CAN'T PLAY WITH SECRET SERVICES" DIGITAL COURAGE Two years after Wau's death, the Wau Holland Foundation was established. Its aim is to preserve and continue his free-thinking approaches. Andy Müller-Maguhn is one of the foundation's hoard members. Among other things, the foundation collects donations for WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks is seen as a continuation of Wau's philosophy. The platform has undoubtedly become an important political instrument. WikiLeaks is very controversial. Or does criticism of it have more to do with Julian Assange? By publishing the American diplomatic cables and other things, WikiLeaks has shown that it's possible to create radical government transparency via the Internet. And governments, according to their current understanding of themselves, have recognised this, or they wouldn't have carried Julian out of the embassy. That's the highest journalism award you can receive: recognising that through your own actions, you've really ruffled the feathers of the powerful and that they believe that your existence and theirs are mutually incompatible. The impression that on Twitter Julian was not only unbiased towards his own publications, well, that's just the way it is. Because on social media it might be useful to employ rhetorical overstatement and hyperbole in order to attract attention. Whether that's good for your reputation for neutrality is another question. The war crimes uncovered by Daniel Ellsberg, the mass surveillance uncovered by Edward Snowden, the dirty political games that came to light because of the diplomatic cables, and ultimately because of Chelsea Manning, all these things speak for themselves. They're all pieces of information that describe firm facts. The idea behind WikiLeaks, that one should use the Internet to counter the wish of governments to suppress information and truths and ultimately prevent us from recognising and exercising our democrating rights, has worked. You're thrashing me, Linus. Now you say something. Even before we really had an Internet for the general public, it was clear that it would either he the perfect tool for centralised control, power and surveillance, or the perfect tool against these. It's up to us what we do with it. That's why it says in "tuwat.txt" that you can still do useful things with small computers that don't require large centralised organisations. That's what the CCC stands for and that's what the CCC does every day. This is the fight against Google, Facebook and other giants, and the fight for the use of one's own intellect as understood by the Enlightenment, for mistrust of authorities, and for technology and competence and using these autonomously. The realities are currently merging into something rather grotesque. Large Internet firms are now employing former presidential advisors and election campaign bosses. Now that Facebook has started to buy up and integrate dating sites, bringing people together on the basis of their psychoanalytical profiles and effectively attempting to create their own population, the outlook is pretty grim. People being held in their own little perceptual bubbles is one problem, but how to get them out of there is anyone's guess. We used to say that people should control technology and not the other way round, but in view of the complexity behind most cases... Deactivate. Bullshit! Zuckerberg is a dangerous sociopath. We can't have people being held in microrealities, being kept happy, having their attention, to all intents and purposes, constantly distracted by diversionary tactics, thus keeping them from seeing real conflicts, engaging in real human interaction and from reflecting on their own actions and lives in a societal context. Also necessary is the human right to unhindered communication, at least worldwide. Wau has had a profound influence on this. Because preparation for war was always based on the principle of preventing communication, because if people are talking, they're less likely to hit or shoot each other. But this also means that things have to be noticed, just putting them up on the Internet isn't enough. A good example is FC/MC. There is a G20 summit in Hamburg. we know the usual press reports on it. The CCC simply goes there and builds an alternative media centre, with its own cameras, with an infrastructure for uploading, with an Internet connection, with an infrastructure for providing the content that the independent journalists produce there. And it does this in addition to its other activities, such as the camp or congress. Enthusiastic people meet there in order to solve the problems they see, and that's great. Has all the enthusiasm from the beginnings of hacker culture now evaporated? All those plans for the future? No. The Internet is cool and gets cooler every day., and it's creating tremendous potential. It's just a pity how little we as a society really make out of this potential. I never got to meet Wau, but I ask myself this: Did he actually foresee all the conflicts, all the struggles, all the social challenges we would have? Or was he surprised himself at some point? I've waited for this question for ages. Immediate experience... Yesterday evening, Rob sat at the front of the rostrum and described how he had only learnt to understand certain problems in the region because he hadn't been virtually present, and I repeat, hadn't been virtually present, but had been there "in the flesh", to use that lovely expression. Because he'd been physically present, able to see people's faces, able to see their reactions directly. And he did this without a medium, which for many is an alien concept. And this direct experience is incredibly important. We really should get rid of all this virtual bullshit. EVERYTHING IS ONE. EXCEPT 0. Subtitling: SUBS Hamburg Michael Hale
