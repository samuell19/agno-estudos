2, 1, 0 And thus, Earth is but a small drop in the ocean of the vast universe full of planets, suns and asteroids we are not alone in that vast universe there are thousands and thousands of other planets and it's not every day that we get a friend visiting from USA like you light it up, man. We are up for a good start but what if it's an important lecture come on, nothing in life is that important plus, we know what he is going to do he will get in, puts down his bag takes off his old man's glasses then wipes his bald head with his handkerchief then writes with the chalk: Resources and Population he's been stuck on that resources and population for two months I'm losing my mind. It's seemingly a new lecture - Yet the resources remain the same - But the population differs Resources and Population In the previous lecture, we started talking about developing countries in Asia Today we continue talking about India According to the most recent annual report issued in the Demographic Year Book India's population has reached 529,343,000 with a 2.11% annual raise The Indian woman gives birth to 5 babies on average which means that every 175 woman give birth to 1000 babies 250 of those 1000 die before the age of two then another 250 die before the age of puberty Between the years 1890 - 1950, India's population's count saw a raise from 276 million to 420 million which means that the high expansion of population is unhindered by diseases, famines, or wars The northern plains are considered the most crowded parts of India These plains include the basins of Indus-Ganga and Brahmaputra. The population count in the Indus-Ganga plain ranges between 500 and 700 persons in a square mile leading to a degree of saturation for that plain that allows for no raise in population count in the past years If only we can divide the earth's population over the rest of the planets we can take the moon or Mercury. No, no.. We take the moon it's better and more beautiful for sure, the moon is the fairest of all planets For ages, earth inhabitants have been in love with the moon all the poems and songs about the moon and anyway, we can see the moon in front of us clear, honest we can see where it begins and ends no boundaries, no buildings no streets, no shops no smoke-producing factories, no tiny apartments no buses, no people everywhere lectures, theaters, cinemas the moon is vast, and empty the population distribution in the European Mediterranean sea Italy: 50,300,000 Spain: 30,000,000 Yugoslavia: 19,200,000 and thus, the total count is 90,500,000 on the European side of the Mediterranean and we previously mentioned the 239,300,000 inhabiting north-west of Europe and 79,800,000 in mid and west Europe Soviet Union has 252,000,000.. Bringing Europe to a total of 633,500,000 inhabitants When we spoke of Asia in regards to its population We mentioned that without the Soviet Union, Asian population amounts to an average of 1,280,000,000 Africa The population of Mid-Africa... South Africa Including Rodissa, South-Africa : 30,500,000 West Africa, includes Guinea, Ghana, Togo Cameron: 56,100,000 bringing Africa to a total of 274,000,000 But the scene appearing before us, as our ship curves around the moon is never before seen on earth. Particularly the volcano openings scattered all over the surface varying in shapes and sizes some are tiny, hardly recognized from 200 miles away and some are big, almost 100 miles in diameter but as we know, the moon is devoid of air and water we approach the moon. We get close we become only 200 miles away from it as our captain flies into a circular orbit around it Did you see it Nadia? Apollo arrived yesterday - really? - Wakie wakie I swear I didn't know - Good job! - It's not just them The Russians have been sending humans and animals to space for years and Luna 15 was launched 4 days ago what matters is who will sit foot on the moon first - So it's just a race, like the football league? What league? It's all for the sake of science and technology That's not the point. Can you imagine that in 3, 4 years.. - The moon can be.. - Enough, where is the lecture notebook? And the moon enlarges, as we see it through a small telescope - Where are you going? - I'm finished - You hardly ate anything - I had a sandwich at the university TV, 9:30: A documentary about Apollo's space travel A spokesperson of the Space Agency said that Apollo And now for the headlines of this news coverage The president received a visit from the ambassador of the USSR in Cairo Our Jet Fighters force the enemy planes to retreat back east and all our planes returned back safely and from Houston, United Press Agency announced that the countdown has begun for Apollo 11 spaceship in preparation for launching outside of the earth atmosphere and that concludes our news hour, live from Cairo and now with commentary on the news Titled: Israel's occupational intentions in the middle-east 9:30 A documentary about Apollo's journey to the moon - What's up dear? - Good evening, Auntie.. - Can I watch your TV? - Of course, come in. - Could we switch channels? - What do you mean? - Switch to channel 2 - Ah, you mean the other station.. But it's working fine on this one, Just watch Reuters just reported from Houston, that the three astronauts sent a message to earth communication center saying that now they can clearly watch the TV signal transmitted towards them inside the spaceship They also mentioned that all devices are working perfectly and that the journey is going according to the programmed plan it's expected that the three astronauts would send another message at exactly 9:00 pm GMT reporting to earth followup center the full report of the spaceship devices in preparation for firing rocket propellers, as part of the moon landing procedure it was reported at 6:00pm that the primary maneuvers were successful in launching the vertical rocket propellers it's expected that the rockets will launch in three hours after landing orders are given a spokesperson from NASA announced that.. The astronauts take the shuttle on their way to the spaceship Hello Hello My name is Farid, but you call me Ferry I saw you before in the University but you weren't paying attention Sheraton? Or Haram Street? What do you say? There is a 23 inch TV inside They landed on the moon! Population explosion hear hear population explosion The world might face a famine by the year 1980 In America alone... What is that? Do you plan to return to studying? - Not me - Then who? - It's hers - Who is she? She. - Cute? - 18 years old. - Dark skinned? - Crème Chantilly looks like you fell! - Not me - Does she love you? No, she is in love with the moon. Hello... Mr Farid? Tonight. Don't be late. The world might face a famine by the year 1980 The increased overpopulation, unmatched by an increase in resources Threatens with a catastrophe that we have to avoid. In USA, there are 17 million whose resources can't cover more than one meal a day. And 7 millions who can't even afford that one meal One third of the third world population suffers from unemployment 320 million unemployed TWO Idea and Directed by: Mohamed Fadel ONE You are 100 times prettier than the photo. I love you. I wish we could remain that way forever - Who do you say so? - They all do. - Who? - My friends who got married What do they say? That after the first 2 months are over.. What happens then? - We get used to each other - And stop loving? Liars, I'll love you as long as I am alive ONE Directed by Mohamed Fadel - How much time is left? - 3 hours and 45 minutes Is it your first time traveling? And where is your wife? Are you traveling on business? Then you should have taken your wife to travel with you. I'm not coming back. - Migrating? - Almost You think you can make it abroad? Traveling is the only solution I don't think so Traveling is an escape. And escape is never a solution. The solution is to secure a future in your country.. By using Samt.. From Johann Strauss, we listened to the four Célèbres Valses Vals Del Emperador. Op. 437 played by Minneapolis symphony Orchestra conducted by Antal Doráti This concludes our transmission for now, to resume at 7 am. On the same wave 282.75 frequency 1061 Kcl We wish you good times And a good sleep, and pleasant dreams. Good Night What is it? I had a request to file to the board. Regarding cancellation of the late-for-work penalty. And I was hoping to get your signature before I file it in. Honestly, I have no other sources of income so if you can recommend.. That the penalty would be deducted from next month's pay. So I have a chance to prepare, you know the household responsibility and I was never reckless. It's just circumstances that force me.. Fine, fine. Just go to work now But Sir, my pay is about to be deducted.. Well hello Sir. At your service. You will come yourself? That's an honor to the whole company. Did he notice? Listen up. we have a saying that goes The clever one could weave with the leg of a... Meaning that if I have any skill, I should use it For example, If I can type, I buy a small typewriter and I can work on it in my free time. For sure the income will increase. The program would like to thank you, on behalf of the audience. And we hope that they benefited from such great opinions. Did he notice? He is the one who reports you every time. Wherever you are. Whatever you do. Be careful. The camera is behind you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you, and till next week. No way! how are you? Are you a father yet? It was a pleasure. Stop fooling around. You are still the same. Nothing has changed -Do you still see any of them? Here is my card. It has the numbers for my house, office and clinic. Now you have no excuse, let's meet again. Listen. Yes Sir. You need to understand that you work in a respectable place. It has rules and customs Yes Sir, I'm at your service. What can I do now? I will have 4 pounds deduction. The debts alone are 12 pounds Should I create money! Imagine I can't close my eyes before 5 am. When can I wake up? I can not sleep without a sleeping pill. And now it's two or three pills. Oh God! And now no less than 5 pills till I get to sleep. Seems we got old without realizing. Do you remember the old days? I remember I always wanted to be a musician or a painter, not an accountant. Even though I never knew how to play music or draw. But I think if I learned, It would have worked out. - Coffee - and you Sir? -ATTRITION WAR- The issue is merely economic inflation. No one can deny it is a chain that starts in the heavy duty factory making tanks and jets, and ends with poverty in another country. Any other country where these weapons are used. It's not an issue of freedom, it's just markets that need to be opened for goods to be consumed Every production musts be met by consumption, right? In that name of Allah. And peace be upon the last of his prophets. Dear brothers.. Indeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct and giving to relatives and forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression. He admonishes you that perhaps you will be reminded. I'm no beggar my brothers.. As some of you might have thought. Nor am I mad, as other might think. I'm a scientist, I swear to God. I have a message, so heavy that a mountain can not bear. I'm only asking for a loaf of bread, or its equivalent. Five pounds. I told them you will pay at the branch. Don't nap now, so you can sleep at night. May he rest in peace. He was a kind man. The only one who sympathized with me. Death always likes to pick. Like a horse. Anyway, I will prescribe you some supplements. But this is not related to sleep. As I told you, the only solution is.. That I try not to think. And to bid myself a good night once I enter the bed. Right? Here is my card. It has the numbers of my house, office and clinic. No, not to that extent. But anyway..listen.. - Shall I offer you some sleeping pills? - Like what? Valium I'm used to it now. it doesn't work anymore. Librium. I tried it after the Valium stopped working. I slept for 2, 3 days, by the forth it was getting difficult. I took 5 pills on the fifth day, and I still stayed up all night. Valium and Librium have the same ingredients, right? So you became a real specialist. I tried most sedatives. I kept switching once I hit my threshold. And so on. Did you try Amytal Sodium? - What is it called? - Amytal Sodium. But it's a strong effect. And you have to be cautious using it. Only half a pill before sleeping daily. Five pounds. I told them you will pay at the branch. The previous time, I only ordered to deduct your days of being late. This time, there is no enough punishment for your wrong-doing. Choose yourself. It was impossible to reopen before making a new diagnosis. That's what they taught us. And I can't leave a case like this. I opened, took a slide, and made an analysis. Listen.. Try counting from 1 to 100. - What? - Count from 1 to 100. Is that strange? Lay down, relax and count. 1..2..3.. Pounds. I told them you will pay at the branch. So she said she is coming by with Essam, Madiha and the kids Because Essam is about to travel, and they are fare-welling him. The university in the USA sent him a contract and a ticket. One.. Two.. Three.. Four.. Five.. Six.. Seven.. Eight.. Twelve.. Fourteen.. Fifteen.. Household..12 for the debts. 6 pounds for cigarettes. One... what! A million? One million what? I'm saying 64 million dollars. The bombs shelling Vietnam cost 64 million dollars per day. Isn't that sinful, uncle? Uncle.. What were you thinking? Nothing. You know, Madiha, when I was you age..I had a neighbour who looked exactly like you That was 25 years ago. Oh uncle..that's why you have insomnia till now? Insomniac? But I'm sleeping. One..Two..Three Four..Five..Six.. Seven..Eight..Nine Ten..Eleven..Twelve... Thirteen.. What do you want? I want to sleep. Twenty-Seven... Twenty-Eight..Twenty-Nine.. Thirty.. There is a tax raise applied to your salary starting this month. What was the accounting mistake exactly? He married someone there, and he is earning 20 double his salary here. In hard currency of course. Weapon factories must shut down, production must be distributed. Distribution requires a war..Korea, Vietnam, Egypt..anywhere. It's just markets for their products. That's how they can afford Cadillacs and Rolls Royces.. And Champagne. Sleep. - One Hundred and Five..One Hundred Six.. - Wrong, wrong, wrong. That's not what I asked. What's the point of counting when your thinking is still the same. Shall I start from the beginning? There is no point. I start from the beginning. And when I reach a hundred.. I will sleep. I swear I will sleep. I swear to God I will sleep. Just don't swear if you won't honor that oath. Mom.. What can I do if I can't honor the oath. You fast for three days my dear. Did you fast till noon today as we agreed? I'm lying to you. I don't fast. I ate this morning. This time, there is no enough punishment for your wrong-doing. Make a decision. Make a decision.
