CHO JIN-WOONG, BAE SOO-BIN JEONG HAE-GYUN, CHA SOO-YEON ME AND ME Jin-kyu, what is it? You didn't go home? I forgot something. What did you forget? Must be something important seeing how you're out of breath from running. I didn't run, I rode my bike. What is it? Want me to look? No. I have a right to privacy. Well, I don't want to impede on your privacy, but I'll give you some advice. You should organize your locker. It's my locker, I'll take care of it. Jung Jin-kyu How nice. - This one? - On the right. - The one on the right? - Yeah. - This one? Okay. - Yeah. It's falling! All right! It's so good. - Not bitter? - Not at all. Then, shall we pull these down, and leave just a few? Why leave a few? For the magpies. They need to eat, too. Sure. You're so kind. Recently, we've had incidents of elks coming down from the mountain and causing much damage. Therefore please clear away harvested food... The days are getting short. You're right. Everything's so regular here. It's interesting. Wow. These wild mushrooms used to be so expensive. When I was a kid, we got these once as a gift. You need to take a big bite out of them to get the fragrance. But Mom cut them in tiny pieces so we can savor them sparingly. Oh no! We really struggled back then, after Dad co-signed a friend's loan. I couldn't even shower at home. Mom wanted to save on the water bill. Then where did you shower? Well, at school in the summer. - And in winter? - My friend's house. You poor thing. Now it's just a memory, but I was so upset then. Your mom must've felt even worse. I fought with her all the time. I was only thinking of myself. I was a bad son. But I didn't get to apologize to her. When she was alive, that is. Soo-hyuk. Mom? Mom... Yes, it's me. I'm sorry. I was too immature back then. It's okay. I'm the one who feels sorry. It must've been hard on you as a kid. Green light... red light! - Such clean air. - Green light... red... I'm so envious! Honey, kids need to live like this. Running about in nature. Hey, schoolteachers here are all dying to move to Seoul. Why go the opposite way? What's so great about Seoul? The rent is going up every year... And once you have kids, what about their education? You think kids from this countryside can make it to universities? Actually, the quality of education is better off here. I feel sorry that your wife met a weirdo like you. Is it really okay living here? I like it here. She appreciates nature. You're the weirdo, dude. You're the weird one! Isn't he hard to put up with? Don't even get me started! You're really cold-hearted, you know? Not putting us up for the night? I'm sorry, it's a schedule clash. We've been planning this for ages. I don't know what to say. Honey, let's go. - Should we go? - Yeah. Let's go. I'm heading that way, so let's say bye here. Okay then. Have a good life! Goodbye! - See you next time! - Bye! - Goodbye! - Goodbye! I'm sorry. For making you lie to your friends. Putting on an act with an empty suitcase. It's all right. If I hadn't, they would have refused to go home. Oh my, if you do it that way the yarn gets tangled. Try it like this. What's the point of making these dolls? I just want to knit sweaters. How long will we do this? After this, the intermediate level will be easier. People do fine without making these things. If you want an ordinary sweater, there would be no need to spend time learning, would it? Investing time and effort will get you a great result. What? I'm not done yet. All right, all right. Miss, I need to go early. My husband wants me to work in the greenhouse. He could have just told me in the morning. It's so annoying. Goodbye. Have a nice evening. Knitting Class It's sure tough to teach. Everyone's so busy here. They might cancel this class because we have so few students. Really? English conversation and computer classes are popular. But knitting... Can't be helped. Even if the class is canceled, you should keep knitting. You have talent. I'm all thumbs. It's just that you teach so well. Not at all. You picked it up quickly. No, I'm really clumsy. Did you suddenly get possessed by a knitting master? You're really good at it. It's pretty! When you finish, who will you give it to? Don't tell me you want it? I wouldn't mind. If we had a daughter, I bet she'd love it. Don't say things like that. There's no reason we can't have kids. Then there's no reason for us to come live here. Then... Won't you regret it if there's no product of our love? The fertility god won't be happy. I was so exhausted today. All night long... Stop it! Nice pitch! Strike! Strike two! You pitch well! Listen to you. You should've been a comedian, not a teacher. In college, I almost tried out for a comedy group. - Really? - I'm serious. Watch. "Even if the sea's full of cola You still need a cup to drink! Dah dah dah! Dah dah dah!" Hey, punk! Who's gonna laugh at those crappy jokes? This is how you do comedy, punk! Who are you? I'm the king of comedy! Sorry for my ugly face. Are you Lee Ju-il, the legendary comedian? Repeat after me, punk! So how many times does 0.1 go into 4.5? 45 times! - Right. How about 1.9? - 19 times! - Easy, right? - Yes! - Jin-kyu. - Yeah? Do you understand this? I understand. Then can you solve this on the board? Here. Jin-kyu can't do it! Jin-kyu needs a little time, so let's not rush him. Each of you solve it at your desks. Jin-kyu, what don't you understand? Teacher, are you a strange person? My dad asked me if you're strange. But who's Lee Ju-il? Ma'am! Why are you pushing your bike? Seems I got a flat tire. A flat? That's not good. I'll have my husband take it to the bike shop for a patch. Then you're gonna walk all the way home? I'll just think of it as exercise. Careful, then. Ma'am! I'm going downtown in a bit. I'll get that tire patched. It probably won't fit in your husband's car anyway. - Oh, Mr. Kim! - Oh, hello. What are you doing here? We had a school dinner. I see. Oh, your wife's bike is in my car. She got a flat, so I told her I'd fix it. Sorry to trouble you. It's no trouble. I'll leave it at your house in a bit. No, it'll be late. Just come tomorrow. I'll just leave it in front of your place. No one will steal it in this town. No, bring it tomorrow! All right, then. Did you come to our house last night? No. Okay, see you. Ma'am? Ma'am! What's going on? Honey, stop! What the hell? Wait! - Wait, don't go! - Out of the way! Please let me explain. Get out of the way! No, don't go like this! Move! Wait, please! Let me explain. It's a good thing I did judo in the past. If it were you, you'd be hospitalized with a broken back or neck. You did judo, and she still beat you up? Last night she was possessed by Rikidozan, the king of wrestling! It's hard to believe. You think I'd make this up? I thought it was strange for people from Seoul to move down here. But how can Soo-hyuk live with her? Here she comes! Such a gentle woman, with a wicked illness like that. Mr. Kim begged me to keep it a secret. I'm just telling you since you're the village foreman. All right? Let's keep it between us. No need to let it spread through town. But can we really ignore it? If it happens every night, in other words, she transforms into an insane person every night. She's not insane, she's possessed. Same thing. Years ago, a shaman lived here, and there was no problem. That's because she told fortunes and performed rites. She was scary during the rites, but otherwise, she was fine. Then what's the difference? You think she'll tell fortunes? My son's marriage plans keep falling apart. Don't go around talking about this. Anyway, this is our secret. All right? I think we should... Hello, Mr. Kim. The word got out... Thanks for your efforts. Please don't thank us. Anyway, it's done. Aren't you curious? What? About what? How I turned out this way. Not at all! You must feel awkward. Goodbye, then! Bye. The villagers said it would ease their fears. Well, then... Mr. Kim, I'm leaving the key! Do I have to do this every day? Who was I last night? Was it hard on you? No. It's never hard. No matter what happens. Then I'll be back early in the morning. Just a minute. What? Lock it, then unlock it tomorrow. But Mr. Kim, how could I... Honey, don't do this. You'll unlock it in the morning. What good deeds did I do in my past life to meet a man like you? What good deeds did I do in my past life to meet a woman like you? It wasn't good deeds that brought you to me, it must have been bad deeds. No, I must have done something incredibly good, I'm sure. Let's have a baby. Hello? Sure, I'm doing wonderful. No, no need for that. We're very happy. I envy them. They're lucky. Hello? Mi-kyung? Nothing special, I just thought of you. Where's your husband? Oh, really? Shall we have a drink? Just one drink, only one. That's not it! - The woman died? - What? Both of them died. Where the hell have you been? - Please move aside. - What happened to them? They took away the bodies. The whole mountain almost caught on fire. Oh my god! I had the key with me! The key? Throw it away! No passing this line! Passing through. - Detective Jo? - Hello, sir! - Here? - Yeah. What happened? A short circuit, apparently. When the rescue team arrived, they had suffocated to death. Why couldn't they get out? Sir, the doors and windows had steel grates on them. The rescue workers cut their way in. What? Strange, huh? Cut their way in... That's pretty bizarre. Cut their way in... What will we do about this? Even if the fire was an accident, we locked up two people and they died! That's no ordinary crime. We'll say we don't know anything. How? We didn't know. Otherwise, we'll all go to jail! You had the key. And you built it. It was your idea to cage them in! I never said that! Then who else? You're the village foreman! I can't believe this. I'm innocent, really! I just said we should all gather to discuss it. I never suggested any cage. Then who? Who mentioned it first? Who said it? Wasn't it you? What? I just agreed when someone suggested it. It wasn't you? Have you ever seen me speak up first? - But you were the first... - Everyone denies it! - You gave ideas more than anyone! - You're the most likely one! It's such a shame. You said it. I told him to find a house downtown, but he picked that old one in the outskirts... Speaking of that, do you know why he moved there? I'm not sure. After we hired him at this school, he spent time looking... Why? Anything suspicious about it? A number of things. You think it was arson? No, I don't think so. But it's odd... About the deceased couple... Was there anything strange about them? Strange? Well, to be specific... in a sexual way, were they perverted in any way? What? I think I need to ask a bit more about that teacher. If I can meet with his students and talk to them... That won't be possible. It's not good for their education. Not good for their education? Give me a break. How good is their education anyway? Everyone goes on about human rights... They treat cops like some kind of gangsters. Really gets me going. Oh my... What's that? Look at those two. Wow. Right, they have something to fight about. You're hopping mad, huh? Just raging! Way to go, boys. Go at it! That's right, great! That's what I like. Nowhere to park. Damn it... There's one! Yeah? Sir, can you talk? Go ahead. One guy in the photo is named Jung Hae-gyun. He was the last one to call the deceased. And the other? Park Doo-hee, the village foreman. What? Park Doo-hee, the village foreman! Oh, shit! What? - No, it's nothing. - Are you okay? I'm fine. I'll call you back soon. Jeez... Why is it parked like that? How could... I can't believe this. That isn't one of our residents' cars. I got angry when I saw it parked crooked in the afternoon. It's still here. Ma'am, this... It's okay, I didn't see you scratch that car, Mr. Park. Hey, what are you talking about? Who do you take me for? I'm a cop. I'm home! You're back? Honey. How's Ji-sung's asthma? You went to the doctor? Yeah. His asthma improved, but his skin is acting up. You want dinner? No, I'm fine. Didn't think you'd be back tonight. I guess it's a simple case? Not simple, but not too complicated. My boys! Daddy's home. - You're not making sense. - Look at them. There are all kinds of leads, but I'm not sure how it will end. What do we have here? My boy got an award again! Don't investigate too hard. Or you'll turn ordinary people into criminals. Don't invent stories, just go with what you see. Ji-hyun, are you a cop? I'm saying don't overdo it! You can't retire early with that salary. You gotta work a long time to get a big pension. I'll peel you some fruit. Eat that before bed. You married a cop, why go on about the salary? What did you say? I didn't say anything. You need to stop talking to yourself. Criminals will all figure out what you're thinking. I don't do that! I never do. Of course you do. Even when I'm here, you mutter on to yourself. Like I'm not standing in front of you. It annoys me. It's like you forgot I existed. Why get annoyed over that? Everything sets you off. There you go again! No, I didn't say anything. According to the phone records, you were the last to call him. It was a consultation about my son. A 15-second consultation? Why do you keep asking? I didn't start that fire. Right, you say you didn't know about the fire. Where did you go off to on that night? That's my private business. Look, I'm asking because you're the prime suspect. Why am I a suspect? I wasn't even in the village! That's the perfect alibi. Isn't that interesting? It was a short circuit! But what if it was planned? It's okay, come on in. He's a good person. Exactly. He's a good person. Now if a good person makes a mistake, then everything starts to get worse. But Hae-gyun didn't start the fire! No, not a fire. He didn't start the fire, but he did something, right? What did he do? He didn't do anything! Why did you fight with him yesterday? I didn't fight with him. What? I saw it myself, why are you lying? Then I have no choice but to suspect you. Why me? If you lie to a cop during an investigation, it's evidence that you did something wrong! Detective, we did nothing wrong! It's not us, it was those people who were strange! We only tried to help them! I never speak up first. I didn't do anything! Here it is. You expect me to believe all that? It's the truth, really. You saw all the villagers. You could have all agreed to lie. How could we all match our stories? Okay. Let's stay calm. All right. - Hae-gyun. - Yes? Where were you on the night of the fire? Kilimanjaro Motel. Where? Kilimanjaro Motel. Very specific. Where is it located? In Jecheon. That's quite a trip. Were you alone, or with someone else? With a woman. So, which woman? Sir, please... Look, you're acting suspicious! If you act like this, you'll be charged with murder and arson! Why are you doing this? I'm truly innocent. Okay then, continue. Answer the question! A former classmate. From our school? Name. Park Mi-kyung. You're insane. Give me her number and address. Sir, I really... Tell me! You think I'm joking? About her... She's the wife of the chief at your police station. And my first love. You've really gone mad. She's really the wife of the chief? Okay then. No, no need. I'll stop by the station later. Who are you? What about you? This is my house. You're home, Jin-kyu? Hi, Dad. Who is this man? He's a friend of mine. My son's home, so let's talk somewhere else. That key... Can't you say you had it? No way! I didn't have it. But that would make things simpler. Shut up! What are you going on about? You're all plotting! Want to go to jail? I can't believe anything you guys tell me. This whole village is like a mafia family. Anyway, I'm going to find out everything, just you wait! Hello? Yeah. Yeah. All right. Just as you requested, the whole village is gathering. Let's go. So is everyone... What is this? If we're going to talk it'll take a while, so let's do it over dinner. A policeman can't accept meals from suspects. Clear this away, okay? Sir! Today's my birthday. So don't misunderstand, and come sit here. Don't be so inflexible! But I'm investigating. We're not stopping you. We're just saying, eat first. Then all of you eat. I'll collect your personal data. - Everyone's here? - Yes. Then later, I'll summon you all... Oh sir, sorry. This isn't... oh my. - Come this way. - I really can't. - No, I can't. - Please come. You can sit here. Sit. Clear some space. Anyway, everyone's here? Yes. Sir. This is your party, so please say a few words. With the recent misfortune, I wasn't going to celebrate my birthday. But since it seems we'll all be dragged off soon, I wanted to eat together one last time. From tomorrow, I guess I'll be eating in jail. Since I'm the one who suggested the iron grates. I'm the only one who needs to go. I lived my life without doing bad deeds, but looks like I'll live out my life in jail. Now, everyone. Pour your glasses. No, I can't drink on the job. I made this drink myself out of pine needles. Please accept it for my sake. Just one glass. Then I'll just have a taste. Just a bit... that's enough! Sir... Here... happy birthday, sir. Here. Cheers! You may not see me for a while, so drink up! Many happy returns! Many happy returns! I can't drink, really. Our village elder is waiting. Just one drink. Okay, just one drink. Wow, what is this? We'll talk details at the station tomorrow. Today let's drink our fill. Today, let's drink our fill! ♪ When you need me, just call ♪ ♪ And I'll come running ♪ ♪ Day or night, any time ♪ ♪ I'll come running ♪ ♪ If other people call me ♪ ♪ I'll have to think it over ♪ ♪ But if you call me ♪ ♪ I'll go no matter what ♪ ♪ Cha chara chara cha cha cha! ♪ What am I doing? What is this? My god. Jeez... Has everyone gone crazy? Does this make sense? Hey! You two tell me how you died that day, okay? Tell me. It's true! I'm serious! What? We were happy here. We understand. Damn. I drank too much. Hello? Mr. Park, why aren't you at school? Are you sick? Who is this? It's me, the principal. Oh hello. How can I help you? What do you mean? Look at the time. I'm calling because you're not at school. I think you've got the wrong number, I'm... Isn't this Teacher Park Hyung-gu? Yes, I'm Park Hyung-gu. Are you playing some kind of prank? If you have time for that, get to school! What are you talking about? Calling me in the... Bye. Why did he hang up? What is this? Oh, Mr. Park, I'm sorry! I drank so much last night, I dozed off. My apologies. What's wrong? Sir, are you okay? What did you put in that liquor? What do you mean? Pine needle liquor is strong. We all drank too much. You drank a lot yesterday, too. Go on. Okay then. Shit. The number you have dialed is not in service. Please check the number and dial again. Ji-hyun! Hey, Ji-hyun! What is this... Ji-hyun! Ma'am, where did my wife go? Who are you? You don't know me? What are you doing there? What do you mean? You're my neighbor. Where... Huh? Ji-hyun! Hey! Hey, Ji-hyun! Where is she? Hey, Ji-sung, your daddy's here. What's all this racket about? What's going on? Why are you in my home? Get out! Ji-hyun, I'm home! What are you doing in here? Where is she? You, there! Who are you? Where is my wife? He may have to come to the station again. Someone can mistake his home, but causing such a fuss isn't right. Yes. I'm letting him go since his ID checks out. Thank you. Mr. Park, I can overlook an absence without leave, but if people hear about this issue, it can cause huge problems. What has gotten into you? Mr. Park! Mr. Park, we don't have a student with that name. That can't be. I attended the entrance ceremony. Did someone steal his school records? As I'm sure you know, with computerized records that's impossible. And it's illegal to give data to a third party. Since you're a teacher I made an... What do you mean, third party? I came for my kid! I'm looking for my kid. I came to the ceremony. Please check again. Just one more time, please check. Park Hyung-gu Mr. Park, I heard you didn't go to school. What's the matter? Mr. Park, are you okay? All right. All right. Explain to me what happened. Why am I the teacher? Who else would be? You live here. Not Mr. Kim Soo-hyuk? Kim Soo-hyuk? Who is that? Okay. All right, what happened to Yun Yi-young? - Who? - The teacher's wife! Sir, you're not married. You said it's because you have a wicked illness. Are you going to keep... You insisted on being locked up every night. Mr. Park, it's time for you to go in. Go away. Kangshin Village Hall Mr. Park, are you okay? Will you be coming to school today? You're Jung Hae-gyun's son? Yes, I am. Come here. You're my teacher. What kind of question is that? I'm not your teacher. Why not? Because I'm not your teacher. What do you mean, "Why not"? Why are you copying me? What do you mean, copy? Don't talk back to your elders! Why are you crying? Don't cry. That's enough! Come here. Come over here. Come to your teacher. Don't cry. Why are you crying? Sit down. Look at me. It's okay. Don't cry. Put that out. I might catch cancer and die. What crap is that? Dad said you seemed very sick. I guess you are really sick. Hey, your dad is a total liar. What am I even doing, talking to a kid? Mr. Park! What are we supposed to do if you don't come to school today? Hello, Mr. Park! - Hello! - Hello! - Hello! - Hello! - Hello! - The teacher's here! - Hello! - Hello! What subject is it? Math class! Math? Math... Let's do phys ed. Run out and play. Mr. Park, why are the students going out? Don't they have a class? Mr. Park. Shall we talk for a moment? Wait... Mr. Park! Mr. Park, kick us the ball! Mr. Park! Hae-gyun. Hello, Mr. Park! What brings you here? Well... I just thought we might share a drink. Have a glass. Mr. Park, let me! Thank you. I was just hoping you might listen to my story. Sure. What I'm saying is, in my head, - there's a me that I remember. - I see. So, my name is Park Hyung-gu, I'm a cop, and I have a family. But all that disappeared. What do you think? I'm not sure what to say. So... I've been scraping by on a cop's salary. I've been living with my wife, Jun Ji-hyun, and my two sons, Park Ji-sung and Park Joo-young. But they're all gone. Jun Ji-hyun, Park Ji-sung... Aren't they famous people? It's true! Sorry, it's really true. I see. It's okay. I'm thinking it's all a dream. But this dream is lasting so, so long! Mr. Park. I'm sorry for saying this, but I think... I think, mentally, things are a bit tough... I've got a mental problem? No, I'm not saying you're crazy. Stress! With too much stress... So I need to wake up! But you never know it when you're dreaming. Especially with nightmares, you need to be so scared that you piss yourself for you to wake up. Thank you. So, you wake up at the scariest moment, right? Sure, that's right! The scariest moment... At the scariest moment. That's when you wake up! Isn't that a body? Look! - Okay. - Oh dear... We're lucky that the fire didn't spread to the house. Mister, what is that? Is someone hurt? Yes, well... What is it? It's an elk. - What is that thing? - Isn't it an elk? How could this happen? Where have you been? You're lucky the whole mountain didn't burn. What? Why did my greenhouse burn down? What is this mess? Why did an elk go in there and die? I told you to be careful of elks. Teaching Certification Park Hyung-gu Who's there? Mr. Park? It's so late. I know I killed you today. But you're still alive. What the hell are you? You did what to me? I burned you to death! Mr. Park, please stop this! It's a hard day for me, too! Is it Mr. Park? Over here. Come this way. Mr. Park, why are you doing this? Tomorrow, let's go see a doctor. Hae-gyun. You win. I'll do whatever you ask me to. So, bring it all back. Bring it back! I've got a family. I need to see my kids! You love your family, don't you? I love mine, too! I can't take any more. Please bring it back, please! - All right. - I'll do what you want! - All right then, all right. - I'll do as you ask. Please help me! Bring it back! Please? Hae-gyun, really. All right, all right. Please calm down. The doctor here is one of our former classmates who made it real big. He was good at school, and we called him a genius, but there was a crazy side to him, too. Ms. Yoon, you can go home now. Hi, Hae-gyun. Wow, how long has it been? Here is the teacher. Just think of it as having a cup of tea with me. Don't be nervous! It's good you came. I'm meeting some of our old classmates for dinner. - Oh really? - Yeah. Who's coming? Well, Mi-kyung, Jae-chul, and Eun-ja. We're meeting up here at the hospital. But I have to take the teacher home. It's a shame I can't meet them. It's been ages. Right. No, I can go back on my own. Please join them for dinner. If you don't mind, how about joining us? Sure, come along. No, that's okay. Let's do the consultation. So according to you, everything is just my delusion? Everyone has dreams. You can even have a dream of killing someone. But a dream is no problem at all. A dream is like incinerating the unneeded trash in our memory. Burning into ashes. But as I told you before, it's not a dream. It's all so realistic. Dreams incinerate desires in our unconscious mind, but the desire in our conscious mind is burned by our imagination. You really don't need to worry. Okay. Thank you. You're here. You've been waiting long? We had a lot to discuss. It's fine. Eun-ja will be late. She'll meet us at the restaurant. It annoys me. It's like you forgot I existed. She always runs around in a frenzy, but in the end she's always late! - Right! - Really? Sure! I'm sorry Mr. Park, but I'll head off with them. It's a short taxi ride to the bus terminal, and from there... Can I join you for dinner? - Cheers! - It's great to see you all! How long has it been? It's nice coming out by our village. Being able to see you and all. It feels good at first, but you'll get bored soon. But if my husband gets transferred, we'll have to move anyway. The life of a civil servant is like a nomad. A police chief's wife trying to be all modest. You're obnoxious! Sorry for being obnoxious! - It's okay. - And your kids? What? Just curious how many you have. Two sons. Are they doing well? The boys. He's a teacher, so he's interested in kids. Mr. Park, no need to worry about Mi-kyung's kids. They're the opposite of Jin-kyu. They're smart and studious. They're not just smart, the older one's an athlete. What's it called? Baseball for kids? - Little League. - Right, Little League. He's on the national team. The national team? - Well... - Hey! I saw it on TV! - Really? - Yeah! The older one's a bit weak. He won't be good at that. Is he healthy? What about the younger boy? Sorry? He has asthma. Is he okay now? Asthma? Our younger son is perfectly healthy. That's a relief. Bring them up well. Yes... thank you. Pour me a drink, please. A little bit is fine. Pour him a glass. All right. Let the wife of the police chief pour. Okay. Give it. Mr. Park, I hope you recover, and teach our little ones well to be pillars of the nation. Yes! Thank you. Yes. Hey, cheers everyone! Okay! Good to see you all! That feels nice. - Eat up. - The food's great here. - Have some. - It's good. He didn't drink much. I wonder what got into him. Mr. Park. Sir, we're home now. Oh, right. Oh my god. Going on about the salary... Now you're the police chief's wife, huh? Are you okay, Mr. Park? I'm fine. Want some medicine? I said I'm fine! Goodnight, then. Wait a minute! Wait! That pine needle liquor is pretty strong. Sometimes, people never sober up. That's why you made me drink it? Me? Why? How would I know? I don't know why all of you did this to me. People don't know much about life. I've lived without knowing anything. I just want to know one thing, okay? Why do I have to live as another person? Why? Today was the memorial rite for my wife. I'll pack you some food and liquor to take home. Don't drink too much! Wow. This pine needle liquor... This is the key. Damn. Need to drink more. Drink more. More. What was it? That's the song. More. ♪ Chara chara cha cha cha! ♪ ♪ Chara chara cha cha cha! ♪ ♪ No matter what ♪ ♪ Cha chara chara cha cha cha! ♪ Mr. Park, get up! Dad said you might still be sleeping, and told me I should wake you up and go to school together. Mr. Park! Okay, let's start class. What subject is it? Math class! Math again. Is that all you do? Korean... Your Korean textbook. Let's do Korean. What page did you do last time? Page 59. Then open to page 60. Write to Express Your Feelings Shall we read it? Let's go. "Words to give us strength each day." "Sorry." "A word to soothe a broken heart and ask forgiveness." "Hello." "A word to lay a bridge between the world and me." "Like." "A word to make joy flow from one heart to another." "Love." "A word to cherish each other like a treasure." "Happy." "A word to make you feel as happy as me." "Goodbye." "A word to beautifully end our time together." "How nice." "A word that gives us strength over and over." It's a relief that you don't need this anymore. Thanks for your efforts. Oh my! It's no effort. I always welcome an effort like this. How are you these days? Well, the same as always. Are you still meeting that woman? What? Who? Park Mi-kyung. The chief's wife. What? Be careful. What do you mean by that? We're just friends, old classmates! Kilimanjaro Motel! You went there with her. We were drunk. It was a slip-up. A slip-up? Park Mi-kyung... seems like a nice person. Don't cause her any trouble. One slip-up... A dream... you can think of it as a dream. But not a second time. If you do, I won't ignore it. I guess winter's coming. The seasons are so regular, right? When it's time, a new season comes. And when it's time, it goes away. How did he find out about me and her? So tell me, what will you be when you grow up? A cop. A cop? Why? It's cool. You get to arrest bad guys. Sure, cops are cool. But look, if you want to be a cop, you need to study more. You have to take a test for it. They say it's not hard. The police academy is hard, but the general test is easy. No, it's quite hard. Not everyone passes it. You just need to study 6 months. Says who? Some people study for years and still don't pass. It's really hard. Why would you study years just to become a cop? It's better off to take the bar exam. How do you know that? Who told you? It's all on the internet. You read that? Yeah. Still, it's really hard. Go on home. Go ahead. The internet will ruin everything... Hey, take this. Put it in the recycling bin. - Okay. - You drank it. Okay. What is that? I told you last time. I have a right to privacy. Privacy? Right. Goodbye. Okay, bye now. I used to be a cop. You miss your past, just like me. What time is the shuttle bus? It leaves every 30 minutes. I have a reservation. Sure, your name? Lee Cho-hee. Just a moment. Mr. Park! I didn't think I'd see you again. It's quite a coincidence. The class was canceled after you stopped coming. Did I work hard? Not sure if you worked hard, but you came regularly. So I didn't teach, and studied knitting instead. It's like you're talking about someone else. You came in the afternoon after classes. So I did. You've got a talent for it. Who? You. Ah, knitting... Autumn leaves. How nice. Are you very sick? Just a little. Still, to take a semester off... If I rest a bit, I'll be fine. What's going on? What? What are they doing to it? Why renovate it? So it doesn't fall down. That would be more natural. I don't know how it'll look when they're done, but it won't have that ancient feeling. It used to be so cool. Historic renovations are better these days, it'll be fine. Still, it won't be authentic. I brought you all the way here. Only to find this... I enjoyed it. Park Hyung-gu, Jun Ji-hyun, Park Ji-sung, Park Joo-young What are you doing? Nothing. Just... Wait. Huh? This is my old phone number. Mr. Park! So this number just popped into your head? That's an obvious lie. That's all I can say. That number's two years old, so you've known me at least that long. After I changed it, you tracked me down and got a job in the village where I teach. You casually start taking my knitting class, and then followed me to my favorite spa! That's it! Are you ill? Why invent stories? You're not a cop. Cops don't invent stories, novelists do! That was... my old number. I have a past that vanished. One day, suddenly, my past vanished, and this is all that's left. You're a terrible liar. So you're a stalker in love with me. Aren't I a bit young for you? No, that's not it. I'm really confused why I'm living like this. Sometimes I think I should just kill myself. What? Oh, I'm sorry. I must be drunk. I don't think of you as a stalker. That was a joke. Did you get this number after I changed mine? When did you start using it? About two years ago. That must be it. Still, we have some odd connection. - Cheers? - What connection? Just drink. I've had that number for 15 years. What did you say? What? You just said something. Me? I did? You've got an odd habit. Talking to yourself. You've done it several times today. Really? I'm sorry. It's nothing to apologize for. I couldn't shower at home as a kid. Mom wanted to save on the water bill. Then where did you shower? At school in the summer. And in winter? My friend's house. Poor thing. It's all ready. You're a great cook! No, I'm just learning from a cookbook. Not sure how it'll taste. Hold on, I'll get some water. You have talent. Like you have a knack for knitting. Thanks for always complimenting me. I really mean it! You're quite detailed and considerate. I'm not sure why you never married. Are women so blind? Or are you too picky? I was married. I see. Then, were you divorced? Or widowed? That's enough. Let's eat. Sorry. You're still attractive, so you can start over with someone nice. I wish you luck. Then why don't you have a boyfriend? I don't need a partner. And I'll always live alone. Why? What for? This is getting personal. You don't have to answer if you don't want to. I'll tell you. Since you invited me for dinner. And because I think you can keep a secret. I've got a sickness. That no one knows about. Everyone's got a sickness. Late at night, I become a different person. I start each day wondering who I was the previous night. And I cherish each day. Since it's the only time I have when I'm myself. Hard to understand? Let's just eat. I know about that. It's painful, right? It's really painful. It's painful for everyone. Don't cry. You're not the only one. How nice.
