A packet of Elegantes. - Ten sous, please. - Thank you. I believe we've met before. I'm afraid my eyesight's not very good. Don't you remember... a captain... In the dragoons? Yes. - You often came on horseback. - Every day. With white gloves? Exactly! For the 10 o'clock train? Quite. And you took the "Gaulois"... Quite right! I remember now. It was in '92... Twelve years ago. Impossible. I've only been here since last year. Then it must have been two other people, for last year, I was in Algeria. But I remember so well... the white gloves. All dragoon officers look alike. Well, see you tomorrow. I'll come on horseback, in white gloves, and buy the "Gaulois". And this time... It will be me. You take the bus, Sir? No, I'll walk a bit. In this weather? It's the usual weather in this town. - Sorry! I hurt your foot? - I'm bare-foot. - In this rain? - Gypsies always are. If you're a gypsy, I'm a thief! I'll accompany you. An officer! I've lost my shoe. May I help look for it? That's very kind of you. It's a shoe with a little bow. The left foot. I'm always losing it. The left foot's always smaller. Silly! I've no matches. I have it. That's my right foot. - But you're soaked! - I fell down running... Running in the dark! It's amusing! No one can see you. - Did you find it? - Well, no. I don't care about the shoe. A woman I don't like wears the same. I'll go without. - Right, then I'll carry you. - Impossible! I won't leave you in this mud without a shoe. - Come, let me carry you. - I'm too heavy. Let me go. I'm too heavy. I'm quite capable of carrying you. If the Lady Mother saw me... - Who's "Lady Mother"? - My mama. Oh, I see. And what would Lady Mother say? You don't know her. I'm not supposed to wear shoes... but buttoned boots. I'm all for shoes, particularly yours. You're not from around here, are you? I've just arrived. Funny meeting in the dark. When I left the station, I felt depressed. - This town seems sinister. - Wait and see. It's awful. No, I've changed my opinion now. Wait for daylight. Yes, you must be adorable. - You'll be disappointed. - I think not. Lady Mother says I'm ugly. I'm covered in freckles. - And I'm an old man. - That I don't believe. Your voice is not old. If I were wise, I'd leave you now. - Why? - Because I feel timid right now. You don't look it. I'm getting more and more timid as we approach the light. I'm not intimidating. I ought to leave you here. To let you go on alone and lose myself. But I want to see your face in the light. What do you decide? We'll go on. Of course we will. Well, let's go then! You say nothing. - Yes... you're 17 years old. - 16 1/2. And you're pretty. With a wonderful little foot. I don't know who you are but I do know you don't like Lady Mother. What d'you mean? Yes, you're right. You escape when you can into the darkness. How do you know all that? Because you told me. That's true. And I don't even know you. Oh! You're a colonel! Oh, only lieutenant... colonel. Your voice is younger. I was afraid so. You're not old for a colonel, you're even young. And you're prettier than I thought. Don't talk nonsense! You look like a Botticelli. Who's that? A great painter who painted angels. I must go now. - When shall I see you? - I must go quickly. - Your name? - I'm near my place. Where d'you live? Goodbye, Colonel... and thank you. But listen! Listen! There you are! Where's Jean? - Where's your shoe? - I lost it. A drama. - Mama asked for me? - Of course. - Jean, we are done for. - Why, Mademoiselle? - Mama knows I went without you? - No, I remained hidden all the time. Thank you, Jean, you're a friend. And I'm so ungrateful. Were you bored? I'm never bored when I've nothing to do. Good. What shall we say to Lady Mother? I was at the dress-maker's. If you like. Or in church... Which? - Church would be better. - Getting pious? No, but we went to the dress-maker yesterday. You think of everything. Except... It's pouring. - Yes, you are soaked. - And you're dry. Oh! No I'm not... ...you wait and see. It's as simple as that. Corysande! I'll never get used to that name. Corysande! - Tell me where you've been. - Well, Mummy... Mother! I've told you not to call me "Mummy". It's vulgar... of the common people. Ah yes, like stew. Stew is for the people and it's good. You don't understand. I've been waiting for you, Corysande. - Chiffon. - Corysande. Now tell me where you were. Well, Mother, I went to church. - No, I mean, to the dressmaker's. - Liar! I wouldn't have lied if I'd said Mummy. You've been to the hangar again. - What of it? - Insolence! I've forbidden you to. Jean! It's not his fault. Against my orders too. I went alone. Alone? Without Jean? You went out alone? I called for you. Take that thing away! I've told you I don't want it in the house. There, my lady. Come here. Where did you go with Mademoiselle Corysande? My lady, we went... No good, Jean. Mother knows I went alone. True, Jean? It's true, my lady. You're lying, Jean, you're soaked. Excuse me, my lady, I've not left the house. - It's the water from the gutter. - From the gutter! This is too much. Philip! Where are you, Philip? - Billiards again. - What is it, my dear? Chiffon does as she pleases. She goes out alone. She goes to the hangar. She defies me. She's making me ill. Come in here, Chiffon. I'll speak to her. Go and lie down. Your nerves, my dear. Be a man, at least. Corysande, I'm annoyed. Your conduct is inexcusable. Look at your poor mother. She's gone now. We've avoided a crisis. Only just. What a life! It's not tragic, you know. I don't think girls get on with their mothers. It's time I went. I'm not going to take to the road. The only thing to do is to get married. Bored here, Chiffon? Well, aren't you? Oh, as for me... There's always billiards. Hello, Sophie! Well, if it isn't Captain... Sorry... Colonel... - Recognize me? - Yes! - Well, I was told... - That explains it. You've not changed a bit. 12 years all the same. 12 years... How time flies, Captain... I mean Colonel. - You've not changed. - A few wrinkles. Not at all... still as seductive... The same smile. Flatterer! - That's not worn out. - It's been used enough. - Still in love? - Alas no, and you? - Alas, yes. For the last half hour. - When you arrived? On leaving the station. I know nothing about her except she has a pretty foot. Still the same d'Aubières. - Not married? - No! What about you? Yes. - Who with? - The manager here. Congratulations. And he's very jealous... Jealous... - Funny, isn't it? - No, Sophie. But who could he be jealous of now? Of that smile, Sophie. Ssh, here he is. Leon, this is Captain... Sorry, I keep getting it wrong. Colonel d'Aubières who was stationed here... 12 years ago. So you're back here again? Posted to the 5th Dragoons. Your predecessor was often here... Wasn't he, Sophie? A fine fellow and a great sportsman. He came here almost every evening. Didn't he, Sophie? Would you like room 22 as usual? Yes, as usual. We'll send up your baggage. Still the dragoons? Still faithful to them, Captain... Colonel. Why not a room on the first floor? Price wouldn't matter. He always used to take N° 22. What a memory you have. - Could you make up a fire? - Yes, Sir, I'll see to it. And send up the menu. I'll dine in my room. What I've suffered to-day! One foot is always smaller. Don't you notice the left shoe is easier? There's nothing abnormal about my feet. I've looked carefully. There's no nail. But my heel hurts. Because your shoes are too small. If they were, both would hurt. Tell me I have big feet while you're at it. - I said nothing. - Not you! The lady opposite... did you see her come in? - A little brunette? - I think so, Sir. - Little? - Perhaps so. A coat lined with tartan? - Tartan? - Yes, check! I didn't notice, Sir. Did you see her? Yes, but without looking at her. She had shoes on? Shoes? Yes, of course. - You're sure? - Like everybody else. No, not always. There's somebody who could tell you. - Who's that? - The gentleman. A gentleman? I loved you with so sweet a love Although you'd done nothing to please me And yet I still love you With all my heart And nothing will ever release me I've found out about the lady, Sir. She has her shoes. Yes, I know. That's why she doesn't interest me. But... she is very pretty. She is Madame de Liron. The Viscountess... nobody knows it. She's Marc Debray's friend. Marc Debray? I knew a Lieutenant Marc Debray once. Oh, he's left the army, Sir. He is completely mad. Marc mad? - This is terrible. - It is terrible, Sir. He thinks he can fly like a bird. He makes kites. Yes, kites, with a string. Sad for the family. On my day off I take the kids to look and have a laugh. Quite recently, he broke an arm. - With a kite? - He goes up in them. Gets in and tries to fly. He'll come to a bad end, you know. Good night, Marc, and be careful! Well, I'll be! What? This is frightful! It's the same shoe! Let's go in! Close the door! I'm frightened, Marc. Don't get worried about so little, Alice. Calm down, now. Someone's trying to compromise me... - Nonsense. - But my reputation! No one knows you are here. I understand... this shoe is a warning. I'll ring for the valet. No, no scandal. - What then? - Take the shoe away. Very good, I'll try to find a one-legged person. Well, I see everyone's in bed, Jean. Yes, Mr. Marc. Oh! Cigar... liquor... billiards... congratulations, Jean. Carry on, Jean, carry on. Very good, Milord. How often have I told you to knock? - I did. - You just burst in like that. Well, I'll start again. Uncle Marc, I've come to say good night. Oh come now, Chiffon. Why d'you say that? Because you are too big now for this sort of nonsense. Can't I kiss my uncle? The fact is... I'm not your uncle. Not nice to say that. Uncle by marriage. Not related? No! Yes, I am. Anyhow, are you my friend? Yes, till death do us part. I'm glad you came in. You ought to be asleep at this hour. I can't go to sleep unless you kiss me first. It's the best moment of the day. She is asleep. I can't hear. We are both breathing... Funny, you're a bachelor and you haven't a woman to look after you. You smell! What do I smell of? A perfume I don't like. You have your own smell... of tobacco but that smell is not a man's smell. Should I use perfume? You're not old enough. I'm too young to wear perfume. I'm not a woman, I know. You can unhook me. Do I look like a Botticelli? A great painter who painted angels like women. - I mean women like angels. - Who told you that? - It's a secret. - Ah, you have secrets? Of course! To write in my diary. Right, your turn now. What you need is a woman to look after you. A woman? Oh my dear... You must be hard to please. Uncle Marc... Am I pretty? I've not the slightest doubt you will be pretty, but for the moment you're a little girl and should go to bed. Run along! Good night, Uncle Marc. Good night, my dear. That's a good one! There's one not playing. We'll start again. Grimot, look at me! Only I am interesting. Stop looking up at that kite, understand? Start again! Seen the Colonel? He went that way, Sir. He was going to see the... er... kite, Sir. - Well, finished? - Yes, for to-day. - Will we come to-morrow? - If you like. Step by step we progress. Slowly but surely. - You'll succeed. - I'm sure of it, old man. I'd like you to meet a fine chap who works with me... Marcel Ferrez. Here's the dragon-fly. One that only runs on the ground... and not every time! It's the motor that counts. She'll fly, I'm sure. When I get in there... I know I shall fly some day. It's built for that... sturdy and light. And beautiful. You can't realize that. You've not seen it fly. Nor has anybody else. But I can see it. And it can fly... but I can't. Like a little girl who doesn't know whether she's in love... but I still hope. But to fly, you must reach very high speeds of 40, 50 or even 60 miles an hour! Fantastic! But we shall. I'm not worried about the motor but flying off. Presenting to the wind just the necessary surface. I'd like to show you, but I had an accident. The repairs aren't finished... and my arm... Still hurt you? Oh no... in a week it'll be over. I adapted the motor of my car. That was the best of all. What we need, Mr. Marc, is the new Levavasseur. 9 cylinders, 35 HP and less than 260 lbs. A jewel. But worth 20,000 francs! These days, inventors must be rich. But you are rich. Oh yes... a large landowner. This hangar represents my hunting lodge. "Dragon-fly N° 1" a field and "Dragon-fly N° 2" was a woodcock shoot. But why should I tell you all this? It's of no interest. But you're wrong! In France there is a small number of far-seeing financiers who take an interest in flying. Never heard of John Van Dooren? Not coming in? There are officers there I don't know. I must tell Uncle Marc something. Would you call him? I am sure Van Dooren would be interested. There you are! What's all this? We won't eat you. I'm in a great hurry. I came to say the solicitor's arrived. I know those shoes. You know Madame de Liron? Yes, an old family, from Poitou. The husband's an archaeologist. And the wife is pretty. That's all I know... except she is interested in flying. So you heard? You know I hear everything. I don't listen but I hear and it's dreadful. What did he say? You are ruined. Listen, Chiffon. You didn't wipe your ears properly this morning. Go straight back home, will you! Excuse me. That was my niece. Your niece? Well, not exactly my niece. Niece by marriage, perhaps? Yes, exactly. Well, we won't keep you any longer. We'll leave you to your family. I've been most interested. Would you do us a favour? Have lunch with us. - I'd be glad. - How about to-morrow? Till to-morrow then. I thought chance would bring her to me the same evening. You'll say that was asking too much of chance. Yes, but I believe it. It was going to happen like a fairy story. The reality was much flatter. She was the lady we pretended not to see. A charming person... but of no interest to me. Trumpet practice, Sir! So I heard, thank you. How often have I told you not to? But I might as well save my breath. What are you hiding? What is it? - My diary! - Ah, so you keep a diary? Yes, I do... and it's mine. So it's yours? A mother has the right to know. No, not my diary. Hand it over. You would not let me read your diary. Now I have one. It's for me. Do I ask for your "Figaro"? Leave me my diary. I'll call your step-father. He wouldn't take a woman's diary. - Ah, so you're a woman! - Yes, with a woman's secrets. What's all this? Oh, it's you! - Lady Mother wants my diary. - Give it me. You mustn't read it. - If I promise not to? - Swear it! I swear it. Why the "boring diary"? Because I'm bored. I'll put it there, see? "Principles of Roman Law". It'll be safe there. Ah, there you are. Glad to see you. The solicitor's just left. - Yes, I know. - How d'you know? I met him as he was leaving... and I told him: "Chenu, my business concerns me "and I'm surprised you discuss it why my sister-in-law." He did right to warn us about you. My dear, if I ruin myself, that is entirely up to me... I'm alone. I organize my life so no one can reproach me. I'm ashamed of your conduct. You speak as if I were a criminal. It's worse! They think you're mad. Everybody avoids us. We'll be living in a desert. A desert... don't worry, my dear. I'm bringing somebody to lunch to-morrow. A mechanic, no doubt, like that Ferrez you invited who poured wine into his soup. I doubt if he'd do that... it's the Duke of Aubière. The new colonel... Was that who was with you just now? - What are you saying? - Me? Nothing! So you know the Duke of Aubière, my dear? We were at Saumur together. Coming to-morrow? And you tell me now? This is frightful for a housewife! Don't worry, he has simple tastes. Anyhow, I shan't be here. And why not, pray? I've nothing to wear. "She's nothing to wear"! You'll wear your Pompadour. Oh no I won't! When I sit down they'll see my knees. I've grown the last three years. We'll have it lengthened for you. They add a flounce every year... that makes four. Soon, I'll look like a lamp-shade. Come to Madame Berthin. A pretty dress for to-morrow, eh? Put on your hat... I want you to be pretty. Madame Berthin will be closed by now. One would think you don't want a new dress. Who is Monsieur d'Aubières? - He is charming! You'll see. - Like you? No, he moves in society. - Is he discreet? - Why discreet? Society men usually aren't. They like telling of their adventures... With women, of course. Is he a seducer? What is all this interrogation? Uncle Marc, I must tell you something. Do you want me to meet your colonel so much? You're quite mad. No, I'm serious. But you don't know him! I know him only too well. What are you trying to say? I had an adventure with him. - An adventure? - Yes, an adventure. The other night... the night it rained... But I tell you, Chiffon, the whole thing isn't important. Perhaps... but it could have been. He is very eye-catching! Eye-catching! In his time. How old is he? A year older than me. You don't look so blighted. "Blighted". Where d'you find these words? That was what the crossing sweeper said of Lady Saint-Leu. He looks blighted, your colonel. He talks well, but when you look at him... I should have known him ten years ago. - You were six. - I already knew about men then! Yes, I wanted to marry you, remember? Excuse me for making you wait. The latest fashion paper, Mademoiselle Corysande. Come and sit down. Madame de Liron is here. She deceives her husband too. Will you be quiet! Little girls should be seen not heard. I know I shouldn't understand and I don't understand much. But I hear things that I'd rather not. When Madame de Liron... Don't mention names. Why "names"? Particularly here. I don't think I can teach them very much. What a surprise to see you, dear Marc. You need a dress? Yes, but for my niece. Acting as mother... how touching. You've a charming daughter. Hello, Corysande. How is Monsieur de Liron? Still down in his Gallo-Roman diggings. And Uncle Marc in the skies. You see? You're passing through? I arrived this morning and I'm leaving at seven. Just the time for a fitting. By the way, Marc, you might at least say how you find my new dress. Oh, a great success. See you to-night? Excuse me, Madame Berthin... I'm in a hurry. You can have her, Marc. I don't need her. I'm changing. Make her something in pink. Pink's the colour for that sort of skin. Madame, my niece must have a dress for to-morrow. To-morrow! I can't make a dress in 24 hours. All I can do is to try a model. How about colour? Pink, I think. I have a little pink dress. No, absolutely not pink! Any other colour? Any colour except pink. Will you come this way please, Mademoiselle? Bring me the confetti dress. Won't you come in, Monsieur Debray? Oh, don't you wear a corset? Never, I hate them. I want to be myself with the figure God gave me. At least I'm not copying anyone. I don't say I have a better figure but I like myself as I am. Not as if I'd swallowed a stick. The corset has advantages. Makes a woman more womanly, don't you agree? I don't think so. A large breast, a tiny waist and large hips... It's ugly like a squeezed pillow. Ah, there you are. You're not wasting time. It's charming. Turn round! Perfect! Congratulations! I don't want it. It suits you very well. Just an alteration or two. No, it doesn't suit me. Come now. Turn round a little. It suits you very well. I'll take it. I hope he likes cake. Do you? - Yes, very much. - Me too. Fine. Anyhow, we'll say that's all there was. I don't like having to walk in front. As I speak all the time, my neck aches. Walk beside me. But if Her Ladyship saw us. She said three paces behind. Well walk in front. Then you'd be following me. That's nice for you. I'd feel funny. Good day, Colonel. Ah, it's you! Happy to see you. Prettier by daylight. I want to ask you something... You'll say nothing? Of course not. Shall we walk a little? First time I've been followed by a Lady. Excuse me, Madam. I'm delighted we have a secret. It's the finest present... A fine thing... a secret. If the Lady Mother knew it, she'd make a scene. But she won't. I have not met her. - That might happen. - I hope so. I hope we shall meet again and become great friends. How stupid! I must leave you now. I'm invited to... a lunch I'd like to miss. Society people? Alas, yes. I have to spend the day. Awful! I don't like society people. They're old friends, an impossible woman who married a friend of mine. I like to hear that! Who is this man behind us? Oh... nothing! He's just a man who follows me sometimes. What, he does it often? I can't leave you with him. I'll deal with him. Well, I've arrived. Would you rather stay with me? - With the greatest joy! - You'd do that? Certainly! I'll call it off. No, I don't want you to. Till when? Very soon, I'm sure. But listen. My niece Corysande, known as Chiffon. Delighted, Mademoiselle Chiffon. She told me the whole story. What a joke. And I thought we had a secret. I'm jealous. I've no secrets for Uncle Marc. Except your diary. Colonel, how lovely to have you with us here again. I personally never found Chiffon pretty. I saw her with the eyes of a mother who knows her child's defects. I'd have liked her to be better than me. Natural, isn't it? To-day, I see her with more indulgent eyes. The eyes of a man. Of a colonel for he looked at her all the time and seemed to find her pretty. You didn't notice? My sight's not what it was, my dear. - What now? - Listen! Come in! Excuse me. I am very preoccupied. Going out? Yes. What is it? Where to? Oh, it's not my business. Madame de Liron missed her train? Now, don't get upset! I think you might say how you liked my dress. Did I please you? Not as much as d'Aubières. He's very intelligent... that fellow. I dare say. But he could not explain the shoe. The shoe? That's what's worrying me. I'd like to know how a shoe I lost got back to me via the Colonel's hotel. Can you tell me? How should I know? A shoes gets lost, is found, it goes, it comes. It happens every day. I've got nothing to do with the shoe... good night! - Won't you unhook me? - No, I won't. Why? No time? - I've plenty of time. - Well then? You're no longer a little girl. - Since? - I don't know for some time... you are a woman. Not yet Uncle Marc, not yet. Wretched child! Go to bed, my little Chiffon. Can we look? Would you want immediate occupation? Yes. The lady and gentleman? No, the gentleman alone. The whole house for the gentleman alone? Perhaps the gentleman won't stay alone. At your age there's still time to do something foolish. How old am I? Quite young... about 50, I should say. A little less than that. You're young for me... I'm 76. Do you mind looking round upstairs alone? My legs aren't what they used to be. The dining-room, perhaps? It must be a great love to need this great house. Yes, they'll keep me company. You know quite well you won't be alone for long. I assure you it's the first time I've taken the plunge without being sure... That's a pretty room. It'll be hers. Unless there's a prettier one... I'd like to see a large pale blue bed in there. Here I'd put a Directoire dressing-table and a silk pouf. White satin curtains for the windows and a small lacquer screen. You have a good taste, Sophie. You had to come back after 12 years and fall in love to find out. I'm a complete egoist, eh? You're charming and forgivable. When I look at myself, I feel it's my turn to be indulgent. Then don't look. Anyhow, you look very well. Because I'm alone but if another man were here... But you'll always be alone. It's her room. Yes, I think I'm very awkward with her, Sophie. I must tell her so. But you mustn't. The family's all for me. It's good for me. The mother finds excuses for letting me meet her and has already arranged to leave us alone. I am disturbed by their complicity and help. It makes me unsure of myself. I feel I am no longer capable alone. You're mad! Did I kiss you the first time we met? Yes... of course. Don't you remember? She might even refuse. I've no idea. Well, naturally she would not tell you. I wonder how I did. My dear, you never did. Has she said anything to you? Very little. But it appears the Duke has so far said nothing. Perhaps he's nothing to say for her. But he may be thinking he is 25 years older. Alice de Liron is 20 years younger than you are. I don't see the connection, but even... And the age of your father! He even died before I was born. And I, 15 years younger... You win. I must admit you're the perfect couple. But do you imagine Chiffon with her looks... Looks? She's no beauty... she won't get many proposals like this! I hope not, for it's bad. Bad! With all that income! You've never had money worries. I always had. - You've always been single. - I was single. How d'you know I wanted to be? You don't know what I've given up in order to attempt something. I've led a precarious life... that's why I am single. Chiffon, I was in love with you before I even saw your face. Do you remember? I knew you weren't ugly. I just hoped you weren't too pretty. What would you do with me in society? I'm not the woman you need. I can't be a colonel's lady playing the hostess and receiving people I don't like. I'm just a savage. Then I'll be one too. But a colonel... A savage colonel... with feathers. And then... it's difficult to say... Don't be angry. I don't know much about life but... I see things that happen and I hear conversations. I see people flirting at parties. I don't mean young people who aren't married but the others. The ones who are unfaithful... And If I married you, I'd be afraid of doing that. I have to tell you this. I like you, but... I've never wanted to marry you. And up to now I've never met anybody whom... I really wanted to marry. Once I was married, if I saw someone I liked... Perhaps I'd want to marry him! just imagine what a tragedy because I would probably let myself go. Chiffon, don't you think many women who love their husbands are so tempted? Instead of giving way, they rely on their husband and if he is a good husband, as I'll be... I'm sure of that. Is a good husband sufficient? But you'd be a good wife, Chiffon. And a loyal and trustful one. Yes, if I never met the other man and I probably never will. Van Dooren offers 100,000 francs for... Mr. Marc has not flown yet even after 420 attempts. What is that? It's an aeroplane. Fairy tales! He's flown! That's where he took off! Who's that? Mr. Blondin, bailiff, my boss. Interested in flying? Indirectly. We've come to seize your equipment. A drawing-table. A bench, two vices... A grinding-wheel, a lathe, a forge... Four pounds of wire... No, it's piano wire. Piano wire? Magnificent! Not going to seize my jacket, are you? A sewing-machine. Yes, for sewing the fabric... You'll learn about flying. Yes, most exciting! - And what is that? - It's my mascot. I gave it to him. Shall I seize it? We needn't seize children's toys. Isn't that a toy? No, Mademoiselle, it's too big. Believe me, I'm most regretful. Well, that's all. I must now ask you to leave. I must affix the seals. I'm holding up progress. If the debts were paid, could he go on? Yes, of course. How much does he owe? 37,700 francs. - 37,700 francs. - Plus my costs. - Could I pay? - You have money? I have my dowry. But you'll only have that when you marry on signature of the contract, and depending on its terms. No, that's childish... we must find something else. But we can't let Marc down like this. Your mother has the money, Chiffon. Poor Philip. Philip married a rich woman... your mother. If it weren't so, it would be easy you know her... you know poor Philip. In spite of his rich marriage, poor Philip is still poor. Then why marry? I thought I'd have my way. Well, if I make a rich marriage, I promise I'll have my way. You're here, Corysandre? Have you nothing to say? Yes, mummy. The Duke of Aubière has proposed. I think I shall accept. Fine! Now it's a public scandal! You choose to go bankrupt the day d'Aubières proposes. I suppose the bailiff didn't know... Quiet! If the marriage goes wrong... But Chiffon doesn't want it. You are wrong. Chiffon has accepted. It's official. Well I'm damned! I'd like to hear that with my own ears. Well, Chiffon, the Colonel's lady... Don't joke, Uncle Marc. Oh, so you want to be taken seriously? Why have you changed your mind since 4 o'clock? Forget it. It's past. What do you mean, past? What is this? You can't understand. I'll explain when we are old. You're quite mad. You've changed, Chiffon. Your Chiffon is going to astonish you even more. What is this marriage? A love marriage, Uncle Marc. Yes, Sir? Mr. Van Dooren, please. What business, Sir? About things that fly... Pardon? Not birds, but aviation. Tell him it's very important. What is it? Blondin... never heard of him! He is mad. Tell him I can't see him. Are you Mr. Van Dooren, Sir? The Van Dooren cup? The 100,000 francs? In person. Then get dressed! I'm not in the habit of interrupting my bathing. They are flying, Sir, - At Pont-sur-Sarthe. - Pont-sur-Sarthe? - Where is that? - Ten minutes away by plane. They are flying? I should say so. I saw them with my own eyes. A revelation for me. To think I was the first to see it. - Marvelous! - Like a dragon-fly. The aircraft flew towards the heaven. Did it fly very high? About that height. Magnificent... you're sure? Well... I may be exaggerating a little... say that... This is wonderful! By the way, who are you? Trust me! I'm a sworn official. Ah, police force? Not exactly... I'm a bailiff. A bailiff in aviation? Well, I had to seize the flying machine. I had to. And I am full of remorse. Couldn't we try to do something, Mr. Van Dooren? - Hotel Debray, please? - I'm going there. A betrothal? - Have you seen Mr. Marc? - No, My Lady. - He didn't sleep here? - It doesn't look like it. So he left last night without a word? Not without a word, My Lady. Explain! Mr. Marc spoke to me before leaving. Ah... what did he say? He said... - He said... good night, My Lady. - That all? All I can say, My Lady. Tell me everything! I must repeat Mr. Marc's words? Yes! He said... this marriage is mad. And what then? It's madness, and my brother... is an imbecile. Good... Was that all? - Very nearly all. - He spoke of me? - What did he say about me? - I dare not, My Lady. I order you to, Jean. Then Your Lady ship had better give me notice. - I'd be freer to speak. - What did he say? Well, he said... Engagement and chimney on fire. These people will have a busy day. Mr. Marc Debray, please? I don't know you. You can give information without knowing people. I don't know you but I can tell you that your house is on fire. Jean! Did you hear? A fire! I'll see to it, My Lady! What is it, Jean? Fire, Mademoiselle, fire! What a mess you make! It's nothing, My Lady. It's quite a small fire. I'll manage. My name is Blondin, bailiff of the Court. That's the last straw. For Mr. Marc? Whom I admire greatly. The admiration of a bailiff! I don't know where he is. He left yesterday. But Mr. Van Dooren with his 100,000 prize is here. What, the Van Dooren cup? - You know where he is? - I might find him. I forbid you to leave the house. From the Duke of Aubière, My Lady. Supposing... I found a paper written by a lady... which would open a gentleman's eyes. What should I do? Show it to the gentleman. Tell me, Jean.. Did you find something that concerns me? No, Sir. No, it concerns another lady and... another gentleman. Then leave it alone... other people's business. But it interests me. Just think, Jean. If you open his eyes, he may be unhappy. I don't care about that. And the lady too. That would astonish me! Are you deaf, Jean? There's a ring. And your jacket! It's the Duke, I'm sure of it! - The fire has delayed me. - Me too, my dear. You? But it was Jean who put it out! But I had to wait... because he dresses me. - Not serious? - No. Quite a small fire, Sir. Can I get you something, Sir? No, thank you. Something to read? Well, perhaps the last issue of "Je sais tout". - If you have it. - Yes, Sir. No, I've already read it at the mess. Then perhaps you'd like "L'Illustration" or the "Deux Mondes". What about an album of photos taken by Mr. Marc? Yes, that's a good idea. Let's have the album. What's that, Jean? That was Mr. Marc's first aircraft. And Miss Chiffon next to it? Yes, Sir. - Miss Chiffon again? - Yes, Sir. Excuse me... You're in a hurry... This little Chinese girl? A costume Mr. Marc made her for a ball. Still Miss Chiffon... On her Uncle Marc's horse. Excuse me, I'm wanted. You can't appear like that, Sir. Like what? Well, the moustache... - The moustache? - They're out of shape! - Think so? - Yes, Sir. And now the right hand one. The right hand one... Yes, that's better. There are just a few specks of dandruff. I'm losing my hair... getting worse every day. I wouldn't mention it. - Come along, hurry up. - Yes, Sir. Still here? I'm coming, my dear. Colonel, I'm sorry to have made you wait. Please accept my respects. Hello, please excuse us. Not at all, old man. I was in excellent company. Photo albums are very interesting and sometimes very revealing. Marc has always been interested in photography and flying. Do you know, I think he is interested in something else well. Great heavens! I hope not! Uncle Marc's flying! Yes, flying! It's not the moment... I'll believe it when I see it. Well, come and see! If my hostess will allow it, I should like to see Marc flying. Things heavier than air cannot fly. He is a knowledgeable, though. - What about birds? - Birds aren't heavy. A great day for the Debrays. Marc flying for the first time is the hero and Chiffon becoming a Duchess is the heroine. The wedding should be an event for Pont-sur-Sarthe. With Marc in his elegance as the best man beside the blushing bride. A sight you won't see, my dear. I'm leaving tomorrow for America. Aren't you happy, Chiffon, this lovely day? Yes... Lovely days are like Sundays... they are boring. And all these people looking at us... Aren't engagements horrible? I've no experience. When I see an engaged couple, I'm sorry and I never say anything. We won't be engaged long, will we? No, I promise you. That's nice. My sweet Chiffon... You spoke frankly to me the other day... remember? "If I met a man I'd have liked to marry, I'd let myself go." I remember. One says that, but... Even when one's name is Chiffon one doesn't always do it. It's not easy to let oneself go. I don't understand, Sir. Don't call me Sir... it will complicate things. Chiffon, you've already met the man you love. Since we talked? Well, what an idea! - I didn't say that. - Since when? - Since always. - Since always? But it's sheer nonsense what you're saying! If you want to break it off... just say so. How nasty you are, suddenly! Chiffon, if you are getting angry it's not because I want to break but because I'm telling the truth. - You? - Me. Age and experience stand me in good stead. A child of 15 would see as clear as I do. Chiffon, you're in love with Marc. Marc? You're quite mad! In love with Marc? I've always known him. Love is love at first sight. That happened when you were six, Chiffon. I'm just a child for him... nothing. He has his work, his mistresses and I don't count. I say you're in love with him and you reply he's not in love with you. It's not the same. How awful if he heard! Please never tell him. He'd be furious. You think you'd be very frank, the day you met your lover you'd tell your husband, but you'd say nothing... or rather you'd fight. That's the way it is. Don't nearly all women swear to themselves to be faithful? But they aren't. It would be too easy for the husbands. They only say it when it's too late, when there's nothing left to do. They can make an excuse, the excuse you have that they realised when it was too late. I know I don't love Marc and that you are too sure but since you want. Listen to me, Chiffon. Tonight you'll say good-bye to Marc. If I am wrong, you'll be down in 10 minutes like a child who's said good-bye to her uncle and we'll forget what I said. We'll announce our engagement. Is that agreed? Well, the announcement? Not yet, my dear, in a moment. He is upstairs, go on. Too late, Madame de Liron's just gone. Well, she won't stay there for long. Too long for me. Chiffon... Jealous? Yes... very. May I have this dance? Yes. I'll remember this waltz. Do you like it? The music is so boring. Waltzes have the charm you give them. I am certain that from now on, I'll never hear this tune without a little heartbreak. Don't be sad. You'll find women prettier than me. Perhaps, Chiffon, but... they will all have one very serious defect. That of taking a man you didn't want. - A fine couple! - Aren't they? Chiffon is lucky. You're dying to go up... Yes, I am. Let's finish this dance. Now you are free. Go and join him quick. I'm dreading this. One day, you'll know this moment will be the best in your life. You don't have to face it. An orangeade, Sir? No thanks, Jean. But, tell me... do you know this paper? Well, that is to say, yes, in fact... Good, go and slip it under a door... A door? Yes, a door... of your own choosing. - I leave it to you. - Ah yes... I understand... ... very good, Sir. Take it, Jean. Nothing but orangeade? A brandy, Sir? That's the idea... a brandy. Excuse me... Do I disturb you? I was helping Marc to pack. Why not call me? He doesn't need ten women to help. Besides, Chiffon, you've other things to do. What's that? Uncle Marc, you're taking the bear? You wouldn't understand... It's our bear. His mascot. A cumbersome mascot! Always the same, Marc, no shirts but a teddy bear. What business is it of yours? You understand? Do you hear the saucy little child? Say something to her. No. Very good... I've come to say good-bye. Now you are leaving I want you to know how happy I've been during these ten years together. I have absolutely nothing against you. I want to give you... something I've always worn and will never leave you. No, it won't leave me. Your earrings? You don't want me to wear them? You made me wear them. Don't you remember? I was eleven and I had to wear them for my first communion. Nice, wasn't it? No, it was horrible! You took me to a jeweler, an executioner. I'd like to see you having your ears pierced with a needle... Ah yes, I remember. They're frightful, these earrings. You've no taste. - I must admit... - Put them where you like... in your pocket or on your watch-chain... If you're asked what they are, say anything. But remember those earrings twice gave me pain: the day you gave them to me, and the day I gave them back to you. Pardon me, dear Chiffon. No, don't take me in your arms! Marc, I've been told I'm in love with you. No... don't laugh. I did... but it wasn't a real laugh. No, let me speak. I was told this would be... the most wonderful moment of my life. Don't interrupt me. I replied: I don't love him. Love is love at first sight. And I never had that. He said I knew nothing and that there was love where the lovers didn't even know it. Everybody round them knew and a child of 15 knew, but not they. A very wise person told me... Someone who knows more about it than we do. Well, more than I do... He saw I was very unhappy though your success should have made me happy. I am not a good Chiffon, Marc. It's because I love you I am unhappy to lose you. That's what he said. He told me... Oh, Marc... That... he didn't tell me. - Give me a light. - Yes, Colonel. So you didn't do what I said? As a matter of fact, Sir, no. I arrived too late... it wasn't necessary. -- English --
