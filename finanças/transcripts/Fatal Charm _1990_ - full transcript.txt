(ALARM BUZZING) I'm sorry, darling. I forgot to turn the alarm off. What are you doing up so early? One of my boats came in with a cracked propeller and I gotta go deal with it. Go back to sleep. Will I see you tonight? Maybe. A large crowd began gathering in the pre-dawn hours this morning here at the Ukiah Courthouse where the state begins another week in the well-publicized murder trial of Adam Brenner. The reason for the crowds and the publicity is due to the charm and the personality of the man on trial. Today, he stands accused on six counts of first degree murder in a series of sex-related crimes which police from four-- Good morning, pumpkin. WOMAN ON TV: ...suspect him of committing during a recent three-month long spree, followed by the most intensive manhunt in Ukiah County history. Adam Brenner is now about to enter his fifth week of trial. If found guilty on any one... Would you look at that man? Why would anybody that gorgeous need to rape someone? WOMAN ON TV: Recent State Supreme Court rulings concerning capital punishment. Brenner-- What am I, invisible or something? I'm just so sick of hearing about that lowlife. They should just lock him up and throw away the key. Is that all you're having for breakfast? - You ok? - Yeah, I'm fine. Sandy's gonna be here in a minute. SUSAN: Wait a minute, honey. Lou said he heard you up again late last night. That's funny. I never pictured Lou as a light sleeper. OK, Val. What's bothering you? Well, don't you think things have been a little awkward around here lately? Yeah. I agree. We haven't been seeing eye to eye on everything. Mother, that's not it. (SIGHING) I never know when Lou is gonna be around here or not. I can't have my friends over. What are you talking about? Who can't you have over? Well, when was the last time that you saw Sandy inside this house? I mean, why do you think she never visits anymore? Well, I don't know. Why don't you tell me? Well, she's uncomfortable. She's embarrassed. What is she embarrassed about? This is a very small town. How many mothers do you think are openly having an affair with a married man? Lou's wife left him a year ago. And who are you to judge me? - I'm not judging you! - (DOORBELL BUZZING) I'm telling you what's bothering me. You asked, OK? Well, wait a minute! Let's get out of here. What's the matter? - Nothing. - OK. As soon as I get my diploma, I'm totally history. You've been saying that since grammar school. You know what I bet you end up doing? I bet you go to Humboldt, study there, get married and spend the rest of your life 10 minutes from here. Yeah, right. Sandy, that's gonna be a cold day in hell. (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) I read your work over the weekend and I was pleasantly surprised to find how mature and genuinely thoughtful they all were. But this poem was especially moving for me. I'd like to read it for you. It's entitled "Another Boyfriend." Playfully, I can watch you Doing your natural things Until finally, you feel my eyes And look up, half smiling Wishing I would join the game And share the laughter Instead of sitting out and watching And almost waiting You think I'm looking for a flaw A smudge to mar the beauty But try to understand The love there is in sitting quietly And watching your game grow To fill the world I cherish I'm sorry you felt my eyes And had to make another smile. You wanna tell us what inspired this, Valerie? I don't know. TEACHER: Oh, but there must have been something. Someone, somebody who captured your curiosity. Well, it's not really about anybody. I mean, I don't have a boyfriend or anything. I just wrote it. TEACHER: You mean you just invented this? You just imagined how you would feel if you had someone that you cared that much about? Yes. I didn't know you could write like that. You know, I think you blew everybody away. Why didn't you ever tell me you could write like that? Sandy, I'm, I'm already embarrassed enough, OK? - Hey, you! - How come you don't call me anymore, sweetheart? Because you're one conceited dirt bag, Robert Fowler. Well, you deserve me, darling! I don't know what to do about him. I really like him but I don't wanna go running after him again like I did last time. He'll take advantage of me again. You know what I mean? - Hi. - Hi. Yeah, it's rough. Guys. I mean, when did, when did it get so complicated? I think I detect a victim of that common teenage affliction called youthful idealism. Am I right? Sometimes that girl can just be so self-righteous. Oh, it's funny how they know so much more than we do. On top of the gun control lecture, James is now on my case about capital punishment. - REPORTER: Adam. Adam. - At least it wasn't Adam Brenner. What do you think? What do you think? Adam, do you think you're getting a fair trial? What do you think your chances are? You seem to have a lot of fans, Adam. Anything you wanna say to them? Don't worry about him. He'll be old news by the end of the week. - MAN: Adam. - WOMAN: Do you have a statement for us? Adam, what do you have to say? Adam, are you concerned that John Henry Wallace cannot be found? - Back off. - Adam. We have no comment now. Let's get him upstairs. - Adam. - Back off. Go up the stairs! Well, if you saw that you just witnessed a perfect example of what a lot of young women are calling Adam Brenner's sexy charm. Miss Sims, when this trial began you said that your office felt that this was an open and shut case. - It still is. - Well, it doesn't seem to be going so smoothly now. That's because the defense is purposely burying the facts to create a false sense of reasonable doubt. It's a very famous tactic, I can assure you. But clouding the issues here won't work. The defense has been claiming that Brenner's former roommate, John Henry Wallace is the real killer. - REPORTER: What's your response? - JANE: Another distortion of the facts. Wallace is the registered owner of the van in which the murders took place. But all the evidence we have points to Brenner. REPORTER: But there's a nationwide manhunt for Wallace. Yes. We'd like to talk to him. REPORTER: As a co-suspect? JANE: I'd rather not comment. REPORTER: Perkins has promised to put Brenner on the stand by the end of this week. How do you feel about that? Well, it is his trial. How did you get yourself into so much trouble? - Shh! You'll wake your mother. - Yeah, right. You scared me. Hey, come on, where's your sense of humor? Louis, stop it! Leave me alone. My God! Hey, give me some of that. Come on. Give me some. Go get your own bowl. You smell like a brewery. - Get away from me. - Hey, what's the matter, Val? Come on. You liked it when I kissed you before. - I know practice makes perfect. - Stop it. You're crazy. Leave me alone now. (SOBBING) Can I go upstairs now, please? Look, Valerie, I never would've kissed you if I didn't think you wanted me to. I should have never let you near me in the first place. Come on, Val! It'll be our little secret. I promise it'll never happen again. Val. Valerie, where are you? Honey, come on. It's late. I've got really bad cramps, Mom. I didn't get any sleep last night. OK. You just stay in bed and get some rest. Yeah. Thanks. OK. I'll check with you later. - Feel better. - OK. Bye, Mom. WOMAN: Excuse me, coming through. Pardon me. MAN: Get out. WOMAN: Coming through. Excuse me, pardon me. WOMAN: Excuse me, excuse me. - Oh, my God. It's him. - That's him. (PEOPLE MURMURING) GIRL: He's kind of cute. MAN: He doesn't have a chance. All rise for the Honorable Judge Alvin Mortenson. Be seated. Counselor. The defense calls Adam Brenner. Let's try to make this short and sweet, Adam. Forensics evidence including blood samples, carpet fibers and fingerprints indicates conclusively that six young women were murdered in the van you were driving when arrested. Did you murder any one of those women? No, sir. I did not. But you admit that for the three-month period during which those women were killed you traveled with John Henry Wallace, the owner of the van and the one man whom police have positively established as having been at the places where two of the victims' bodies were later found. Were you Wallace's partner in these killings? No, sir, I was not! Then will you please explain to the court how you came to be linked with Wallace and how you came to be driving his van the day you were arrested? Now, I want you to relax, Adam. And please, be as specific as possible. I met John Wallace in a bar in Anchorage, Alaska on April 1st last year. John said he'd just been laid off an oil rig on the North Slope and was driving to Texas. He seemed OK. So I thought, "What the hell?" - So you two left Anchorage? - Right. And four days later, we hit Eureka. John said he had some friends there that he had to see. And that's when the trouble started. What happened in Eureka? ADAM: It was 3:00 in the morning. I'd just finished driving the last leg. I was really tired and wanted to crash. While John went into this old apartment to see his friends, I went into the back of the van to sleep. The next thing I know is the side door flies open and two guys jump me. They hit me over the head with a tire iron. When I came to, I went to go look for John and I found him unconscious on the floor of the apartment. So when you entered the apartment, Adam, what did you find? Well, like I said, he was unconscious on the floor and I thought he'd been hit like I was, but he said his friends had spiked his drinks and robbed him too. Objection, Your Honor! John Henry Wallace is not on trial here. Your Honor, the only evidence tying my client to these crimes is circumstantial. The only person directly linked to any of these crimes is John Henry Wallace. This is just another smoke screen to try to shift the blame from the defendant! The fact that my client has a perfectly clean record and Wallace has a history of prior felonies is very significant. (VALERIE'S VOICE) Dear Adam, even though we've never met I feel I know so much about you. I watch the progress of your trial and each day share more and more of your growing misery and frustration. Maybe I'll never know all the pain you feel but I do understand the feeling of being persecuted. I want you to know that you're not alone that in my heart I know that you could never have done the things they said you did. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Where have you been? Doing you a favor. Well, I hope so because you owe me one. She took attendance. Thanks. But this is major, major. You're never gonna believe who has a crush on you. - Who? - James Childs! He wants to go out with you. - James? - Yes. The guy in our English Lit class, you know. He plays varsity basketball. Yeah, yeah, I know who he is. Sandy, I'm glad you finally got here. Oh, I've been here. Well, try being here a little sooner next time. Nice try, Valerie. Anyway, he and Robert get along real well and I was thinking, you know just kind of off the top of my head maybe we could double. And James has such an excellent car. Yes, and a very nice large back seat. Yeah, well... I think it's gonna be perfect! And I'm telling you that James is the man of your dreams. Carrie, get some help! Oh, my God! OK. Hurry! JANE: I assume you are aware that John Henry Wallace's remains washed up south of Anchor Bay four days ago. Are you aware of that, Mr. Brenner? Yes. I've been told. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the coroner states: "John Henry Wallace, male, Caucasian, aged 25" "died of acute asphyxiation induced by strangulation" "and the crushing of the esophagus" "caused by garroting with a woven rope or a lanyard" "of approximately 3/16 inch in diameter." In plain language, Mr. Brenner, you brutally murdered Wallace - the same way you did Susan Compton. - DEFENSE: I object! JANE: Stella Holt, Linda Alverine and all the rest of them. I did not! I didn't kill anyone! - You did! You brutally murdered him. - I object, Your Honor. My client's not charged with the murder of John Henry Wallace. I didn't kill anyone! - I didn't! I didn't! I didn't! - Order! JANE: And then you totally invented-- DEFENSE: Your Honor, the only one guilty of-- (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) Order in the court! Hello. (ADAM'S VOICE) Dear Valerie, you can't believe how happy I was to receive your letter. Your belief in my innocence has given me new strength when I need it most. Just knowing you care gives me the will to continue the fight. I shall look forward to the day my ordeal is finally over and we can get to know each other better. Until then, I think of you often and hope to hear from you soon. Sincerely, Adam Brenner. (PHONE RINGING) Hello. Oh, I'm glad I caught you at home. I forgot to take the lamb chops out of the freezer this morning. Do me a favor and take out three, OK? Lou is coming to dinner tonight. Yeah, OK, sure. I've got a date tonight, so you guys will probably be eating alone. I can hardly hear you. What did you say? I've got a date with James Childs tonight. We're doubling with Sandy and we'll probably go get some pizza and catch a movie or something. James. Hey, what's all that noise in the background? Adam Brenner has just been convicted. Guilty on all counts. He's gonna be sentenced next week and with any luck, he'll get the gas chamber. OK, sweetheart, call me if you're gonna be late. Love you. Bye. (GIRL GIGGLING) - What do you say we take a hike? - Yes. - Hey, guard the car, you guys. - ROBERT: Here comes the choochoo. Thanks. It was starting to smell like a gymnasium in there. Not to mention hot. Is she always like that? Well, we've known each other for a long time, but since I've started running track, we've become a lot closer. But to answer your question, I don't know. She's pretty unpredictable. I heard that you're, you're gonna graduate this June? - A year early? - Uh-huh. I went to summer school to build up enough credits. What's the hurry? Because I hate high school. About as much as I think you do. Where did you get that idea? Your poetry. Hardly what I'd call your typical juvenile fantasies. Well, she wasn't supposed to read it to the class. You know, Val, you should be out in the real world. Doing. Living. You know, finishing high school is a fact of life, but that doesn't mean you have to sit around going through some awkward teenage bull. You know? I mean, I don't wake up every morning and say: "I can't face this anymore." - I just wake up and scream. - (CHUCKLING) No, no, I just, I just figure out how to go on. You don't have a mother who doesn't care what you do. I mean, everything I do is OK because it's supposedly what I want, you know. Yeah, well, you're lucky. At least she's not a cop like my dad. I think he's completely forgotten how to trust somebody. Can you blame him, though? Yeah, right, but does he have to bring his work home with him? I mean, all the rules, the regulations? He's immediately suspicious if anything's out of place in the house. With all the problems parents cause it's amazing anyone can grow up right. Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's my point. It's up to us. Yeah. Rise, Adam Brenner. This court agrees with the prosecution's view that you committed these crimes with calculated viciousness each one after careful deliberation. I therefore condemn you to die in the gas chamber at the maximum security prison in San Quentin. No. May the Lord grant you the mercy you never showed your victims. No, I'm innocent. I'm innocent. No, I didn't do it. I'm innocent. I'm innocent. You know I'm innocent. - No. No. - It's all right. No! No! I'm innocent! I'm innocent. No! Congratulations. What are you doing here? Why aren't you in school? - MAN: Mr. Brenner. - WOMAN: Are you sorry that you did it? Do you feel any remorse? - MAN: What about your attorney? - WOMAN: Have you any comment? How do you feel right now? - MAN: Adam. - Get back. WOMAN: What do you have to say to the public? Are you going to make a statement? Valerie, are you crazy? That man deserves everything he's gotten. You don't know what you're talking about. So I suppose you know something the judge and jury didn't? No, I'm just telling you what I think. And what I think is you should be back in school where you might learn something. Mother, I'm not in kindergarten! Well, you're sure acting like it right now! I can't believe the way you treat me. - Just one question. - Adam Brenner. - Over here for standby. - Adam, can you make a comment? Even though the crush of reporters hammered him with questions and slowed his departure, Brenner seemed strangely patient with the situation. Obviously distraught and shaken by the court's decision, Brenner appeared to be in control of what must be great anger and frustration at this surprise sentence. I must say I find it strange that a man of such obvious sensitivity should be going now to spend the rest of his life awaiting execution on death row. This is Kathy Crowley, live at the Ukiah Superior Courthouse. OK. PRISONER: Hey, baby. A real nice boy. - You gotta check this out. - Don't try it, honey. OK, in there. (PRISONER WHISTLING) - I love you. - Come my way. Oh, you're coming in my tent. (CHUCKLING) Welcome home, sweetheart. (LAUGHING) (MAN WHISTLING) - Hey. You got a cigarette? - No, I don't smoke. Oh, no? You one of those healthy guys, is that it? A healthy baby killer? Put your hands in your pockets! I heard things about you about your problem. They say you rape sisters. That you got an eye for sweet things. Whoever they are, they're wrong. I didn't do anything. Oh, no? Why, this is just another middle class white boy living in the wrong neighborhood. You know what I'm gonna do for you, white boy? I'm gonna cut your dick off and shove it down your throat. Turn him loose, Willy. Turn the man loose. Put it away and get out of here. Well, well, well. Adolph. You know something, Adolph? You and this belong together. Thanks. (CHUCKLES) Thanks. (ALL LAUGHING) Come here. Come here! I like you. I like you, Brenner. I know all about you, and I still like you. Now, if you wanna stand on your own, you got to take care of yourself. And looking at you, I don't think you can do that. I think you just might need somebody to help you. I know I did. Hey! The man's coming. I'll take good care of you. BOY: Yeah. Come on, Val! Come on, run! Go! (ALL CHEERING) Go! Come on! Come on, Val! - Yeah! - Yes! Yeah! Good job, Val! Good job. Excellent, Val. That's 10.2 seconds. All right! - Molly, wait up. - OK! BOY: OK, man. See you tonight. Let's call it a day, girls. - Watch out, Jackie Joyner. - Hey, pretty good. All right. This personal cheering section of yours getting to be a regular thing or what? What? You mean my new best friend? I don't know. Let's see, it's been about six weeks. So, what's the story? Is it love or lust, baby? It's neither one, smartass. I thought you liked James. I do. I just-- I don't feel that serious about him, you know. And I don't think I ever will. So? I mean, he just wants to date you, he doesn't wanna marry you, does he? No, of course not. And then he's talking all serious. It's making me very uncomfortable. Just don't feel the same way about him. So dump him. I mean, look, the guy got you off the bench and into the game, right? So who says you gotta spend the whole season with him? Yeah, I guess. Unless you got some other guy already on the side. No. Would you stop? I don't have anybody else. Come on, please. Spare me. All right, but it isn't what your degenerate mind thinks at all. It's totally platonic. (SIGHING) It's like he's not even real. He's about a million miles away and I'll probably never get to see him again. But he's sensitive. And he's kind. And extremely intelligent. And he's probably the most gorgeous guy I've ever laid my eyes on. I don't know, Val. I think you're in over your head this time. I mean, this guy is geographically undesirable and you're still interested? Well, we write. - He writes beautiful letters. - Letters? Let me get this straight. I mean, you have seen this guy, right? Well, I think you ought to tell me who he is. I mean, you get me all interested and curious like that and don't tell me. I just don't think that's fair. Look, the only reason I said anything anyway is that if he can't be in my life, then I'd like to find somebody who's a lot like him. And that somebody isn't James. - Welcome home! - Lou! (CHUCKLING) You should see your face. What's the matter with you? I was just having fun. What's the matter with you? Nothing. You scared me. I didn't see your car out front. It's in the shop. Hey, Valerie. I made a special rambasicci for us tonight. Your mom and I got a little surprise for you. Great. Hey Valerie, you forgot this one. "Dear Valerie, First the bad news." - Give me that letter. - "New trial" Will you give me that letter? - Give it to me! Give it. - It says San Quentin! Give it to me, Lou. What, you've got a convict for a pen pal now? Lou, would you give me the letter? All right, take your letter. (CURSING) You sure know how to pick a winner, Val. - Hi! - Hi. - Here. Let me take this. - Thank you. You can do better than that. What's the matter? What? - Look, Valerie got a letter today. - Yeah? It was from San Quentin. She's been writing some convict. Valerie. (INAUDIBLE) Valerie! What are you doing writing to this monster? Have you lost your mind? What are you doing reading my mail? How long has this been going on? - How long? - Mother, stop it. Leave me alone! Valerie! Valerie! Valerie! - How could you write to him? - That's none of your business. Answer me, Valerie! I've done nothing wrong! You have! You have no right to read my mail! I've got every right to do what I think is best for you! Has nothing I've said sunk in? How far do you think this thing would have gone? Mother, Adam wouldn't hurt anybody. He couldn't kill a fly! Don't be so stupid! So blind to the truth! Oh, right, I'm blind! What about you? What do you think Lou does every time he has a few drinks and you're not around? What are you saying? He comes after me, that's what I'm saying, Mother! I don't believe you, Valerie. Lou wouldn't do that! Mother, you're so stupid! Shut up! (SOBS) You always said it was just you and me! But really, it's only been just you! Just you! You said, "Don't worry about what people think or what they say!" "Just do what you wanna do, be yourself." And I did! But because it made you look bad, you jump all over me! I'm writing Adam Brenner because I know he's innocent. And because I want to. This is Linda Alverine, age 18. What Brenner did to her didn't even come out in the trial. Here! Look at it, Valerie. Look at it! No. I don't wanna look at it, Mother! - I don't need this! - Look at her! Linda's body isn't lying to you. Look at this photograph! She's telling you the truth! (CRYING) You guys. You read Adam's letters. He couldn't do any of this to anyone. Not the Adam Brenner who's writing to you, no. No, I'm showing you the other Adam Brenner. The one who picked up Linda Alverine in a parking lot. The one who raped her in the back of the van while he strangled her to death. Stop it! The one who sunk his teeth into her like some rabid dog! That's the sick son of a bitch who did this. No, he couldn't have. He didn't do it, I know. I know. (CRYING) Oh, my God. MAN ON TV: Tom and Harriet Banks are the lucky winners of this past weekend's Super Lottery draw. The pair came forward to claim their-- (METAL CLANKING) Well, well, well, it's Suzi Q and the Andrews Sisters. Get up. Let me show you something. Come on, come on, come on. Spot me. Maybe you'll learn something. Hey, can I see her? You're a lucky guy. She's a fox. (ADOLF GRUNTING) (MAN LAUGHING) (GRUNTING) (CRYING OUT) How's it feel, Suzy? (GROANING) -Guard! Guard! Guard! -(ALL LAUGHING MOCKINGLY) Guard! Block 11 to Main Control. I've got a disturbance with a possible man down. (CRIES OUT) MAN: Watch out, watch out. I got you over here. Now it's your turn. Hit the wall, now! Hit the wall. Come on, you two over there. Get over there! Hey! Stand back! Get off! Stand back! Stand back! Stand back! I'll kill you, you mother-- Get back! Get back! Get out! Guard! - Guard, get in here! Guard! - There ain't any guards! Come on, let's go, let's go! DEFENSE: Yesterday, a vicious attack took place on my client. For his own safety, Adam Brenner had to be removed from San Quentin. He'll be held at the county jail until his arraignment. Will this new murder charge in any way affect your efforts to overturn your client's previous conviction? DEFENSE: Not at all. His initial trial was a travesty of justice, which led directly to this tragic event. Hey, honky! If I was you, I'd just go for the gusto. I'd say, "Hey, my man, why don't you do us all a favor" "and gas my sorry ass?" (LAUGHS) (WOMAN TALKING OVER RADIO) I got brownies from the greasy spoon. Great. Well, how's our illustrious guest? I don't know. He ain't sat down yet. Pussy. Them brothers gonna carve you up like a turkey at Christmas time. Hey! Get off the man's case, Stuart. After all, that guy's famous, man. You ain't squat. Hey, man, don't be dissing me like that. Oh, don't you talk to me like that either. Who do you think you are? - Man, who do you think you are? - You get out of my face! - Hey, listen, turkey man! - Get out of my face! - You got a problem with me? - Get out of my face! - Get out! - Don't go pushing on me! What's wrong with you? (RETCHING) Help! Help! Guard! What's going on? What's going on? He's having a fit, man. Save him! You go in, I'll cover you from here. Get back against the wall! - Move it! - Get back against the wall! Oh, Christ, Hamilton. He's swallowed his tongue! STUART: Come on, help him. Help him, man! He's choking! - Shut up! - I can't hold him! Get some help! Williams! Now, give me the keys, man. Give me the car keys, man. - Your personal car! - All right. All right. Here, here. - Where is it? - It's the blue Toyota! Who else is here? There's nobody here. They're out to lunch. - You're lying to me, man. - I swear to God! Come on, let's go! Look, I got a wife and three kids, man. - Come on! - (PANTING) Let's go! - Come on! - Hey, what about him, man? - No way, man! - All right, come on! Come on, come on! Come on! Come, come on. Come! Come on, get down. Get up. Come on! Come on! Let's go! (TIRES SCREECHING) Come on! Come on, baby. Get in! (PHONE RINGING) Hello. Susan, it's Harry. I'm sorry to wake you, but this can't wait. Brenner escaped from jail about five hours ago. Now, he escaped with two other guys so we can't be sure who's in that car. My guess is, he's headed in your direction. Oh, my God. We're gonna give you as much protection as we possibly can. Now, I'd warn Valerie. And Susan, keep your gun close. I will. Thanks for calling, Harry. I'll talk to you. Bye. Valerie. - MAN: Yeeha! - WOMAN: Hey, cowboy. Buy me a drink? (PEOPLE TALKING INSIDE THE BAR) WOMAN: I'll be looking for some action here, cowboy. - Come on! - You guys. - You don't, you don't know nothing. - Oh, leave those guys alone. WOMAN: All right, come on. Hoo, hoo. (WOMAN LAUGHS) You're a wild thing. Whoo-hoo. Thank you. (ENGINE STARTING) (CLEARS THROAT) - Have a little music? - Mmm. I don't think that we need any music. (GASPS) No! No! (GURGLING) No. No. (GURGLING) (WOMAN SOBBING) (CRYING) I want you to promise me something. What? If you see Brenner, if he tries to contact you in any way, promise me you'll tell me immediately. I promise. - OK. - OK. Yeah. (HONKING) MAN: Hey darling, where did you get your license? (SQUEALS) (LAUGHING) Park the car. You don't think anybody saw me do that. - Do you? - No. No. Is it OK if we just stay a few minutes? Oh, I'm coming, it won't take longer than that. SANDY: Oh! - I'll meet you inside, OK? - OK. I'm just gonna order a Coke. You're gonna worry yourself into Social Security. Look, why don't you just get me a cheeseburger? I gotta go hit the ladies' room. Excuse me. Hi, gorgeous. Hi, yourself. Do I know you from somewhere? Well, I hope so, Valerie. Well, whoever you are, you've got great eyes. But the name's not Valerie so I guess I'll just see you around. Wait a minute. What's the matter? (CHUCKLES) It's me, Adam. Come on, let's get out of here. I don't know who you are, Adam, but my name isn't Valerie. And if you don't leave me alone, I'm gonna call for help. Wait a minute. Let go of my arm. - Valerie. - Let go of my arm! Hey, just wait a minute. Will you check that out? Doesn't look right to me. You'd better check those numbers. - Sandy, you still in here? - Yeah. Hi. - I wanna go home. - Oh, no way, come on! We're gonna talk to the guys at that party. (FLUSHING) And the weirdest thing just happened to me. This, this really cute guy named Adam came up to me, called me Valerie, tried to pick me up. It was so strange! I mean, he just kept saying the name, "Valerie, Valerie" over and over again. It was really weird. Do you have a brush? Mmm? Do you have your brush with you? What's the matter?
